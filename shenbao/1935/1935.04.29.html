<h3 id="c33">中國工業統制之前提 <a href="#c33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— 仁</p>
<p>上海市商會以爲我國工業日益衰頹之原因。（一）爲工業界如一盤散沙。不足以抵抗外國工業品之傾銷。（二）爲我國工業問彼此互相軋擠。以致造成生產過剩。於是特呈行政院。請辦工業統制。以期挽救垂危之我國工業。　夫世界之經濟思潮。在大戰以前。多主放任經濟。重自由之競爭。隨天演之規律。在大戰以後。思潮一變。各國莫不多主統制經濟。一切生產消費。皆求其有計劃而有統制。迨世界恐慌發生。蘇俄五年計劃完成後。統制之思潮益盛。寖至於今日。更進而爲國家經濟主義之「亞泰基」矣。顧放任經濟與統制經濟。本爲隨時代之演變而產生者。當十八世紀產業革命之前後。新技術旣未昌明。舊制度正在搖動。自不能不希望以放任經濟政策。促新經濟社會漸次發展。但在產業革命後百餘年之今日。則產業革命所產生之經濟社會。又弊端百出。於是遂又不能不希望以統制經濟政策。有以矯正之職是之故。各國由放任經濟之轉變爲統制經濟。要皆有其歷史環境之關係。其政策之本身。誠無所謂絕對之善惡也。</p>
<p>然而今日我國之情形。與各國未盡相似。故若使今日我國而亦行經濟統制。則其目的步驟及其方法。要亦不能不與各國有別。申言之。各國乃因生產之發達。及欲維持現有經濟制度而行統制。故當其統制也。但求其生產品不過剩。卽爲已足。而我國今日。乃因生產之落後而行統制。乃因改造經濟而行統制。其不能以但求生產之减少。及同業之不傾軋爲已足。事固甚明也。</p>
<p>年來中國亦有生產過剩之說矣。然此不過爲表面之現象。實則若就今日之生產品。以五萬萬人口平均分配之。不特爲不過剩。抑且爲不足。是則所謂過剩者。實爲不自然之過剩。而此種不自然之過剩。乃由於生產品販路隘狹之故。是以今日中國工業當前之問題。乃在於應如何以謀工業品能有銷路。謀經濟現狀之改善。以求人民購買力之提高。其一也。求生產技術之改良。以减輕生產成本。其二也。抵制外國商品。以求經濟實力之保存。其三也若能努力以完成些三者。而更加以澈底之統制。則中國今日之現狀。又豈不能改善耶。否則一切發展工業之條件不備。而遽行减少生產或保持現狀之統制。則竊恐統制之效未見。而反予外貨以低價傾銷之機會。此國人之所不可不察者也。</p>

<p>長安縣政俗之一斑</p>
<p>長安爲關中首邑、東界臨蘭、西昆咸　、雨接秦嶺、北瀕渭涇、面積東西約六七十里、南北約百餘里、計六千餘方里、戶口除城關區（西京市）不計外、據縣府二十年調査報吿、四鄉共有二十八萬餘人、最近編制保甲、復作較詳細之調査、計有六萬五千二百二十戶、四十四萬四千五百三十口、男多於女、比列爲六與四、分佈密度、每方里約四十六七人、以一縣人口、三年激增至此、一面固由於以前調査之不精確、一面亦可認爲長安前途發達之徵象、茲據縣長翁檉氏所談該縣各種情况如次、</p>
<p>長邑面積、雖有六千餘方里、約合三百餘萬畝、但實際耕種者僅水田二七·五七二畝、旱地一·六九二·七八五畝、合計一·七三〇·四五七畝、此爲完糧地畝、其餘均屬荒地山地、開墾殖林、非不可能、糧賦徵額、民種（普通民地）自二角二分至三角四分餘、軍糧（屯軍之糧）自二角五分至五角四分、王糧（墾荒之糧）自六角五分至一元六角、年徵共達四十三萬數千元、除去水災及汽車路佔用民地等糧賦外、實收亦在四百二十萬左右、此外雜稅收入、如契稅·牙稅·地方稅欵·城關屠斗稅·四鄕畜屠斗稅等、共計亦在二十萬上下、</p>
<p>全縣小學敎育、縣立學校二四所、內高小二五級、初小八三級、學生共計四·三三七人、私立者一三所、高初級計學生二·八六三人、由私塾改成尙未立案之初小三五三所、計學生八·六五八人、合計學校共三九零所、學生一五·八五八人、中男生一四·三九五人、女生一·四六三人、全年經費共八七·二六八元、（按以全縣學生總數、比較全縣總人口數、平均每三十六七人中、只有一在校學齡兒童、可知學校敎育、正有待於推廣也）、社會敎育、現有民衆敎育館一處、縣府門外附設民衆閱報室一所、</p>
<p>自古長安為戰塲、遠如黃巾五胡、黄巢李闖、先後蹂躪、近若淸未回亂、靖國軍張義安之南渡、國民軍楊虎城之堅守、皆以東西一往坦途、無險可扼、遂使長安四郊淪爲戰塲、現縣屬共有保衛團四隊、分十二班、計團丁九十六名、全年經費、一萬八千餘元、各隊分駐引駕廻·三橋·新築·斗門·四鎭、且架景環境電話、各區消息靈通、以故四境安然、治安無慮、</p>
<p>人民大部務農、次則經商、對於工業向不講求、城鄉各處、亦未設有何種工廠、僅第三五區北張村一事、有以舊法制製造草紙麻紙、六區有以編製各種彺器為業者、近山一帶劇中民、農隙尚樵採燒炭、然皆用力多而得資少也、農產物以小麥為在宗、次則與鄠縣南山接壤各處、多產大米、往年鴉片出產甚夥、自去年春初、奉令禁種烟苗、實行劃除、閱時三月、結報肅淸、計剷去烟苗十萬畝有奇、事先本有禁令、但人民鑒於前此之旋禁旋弛、視爲具文、故此次剷除有此鉅數、凡被剷烟之地畝、均發給棉籽補種、以資救濟、幷成立棉花生產合作社十九處、棉花生產運銷合作社十一處、農業生產合作社四處、信用合作社四十二處、向中國·上海·陝西省·等各銀行、先後貸欵共二十餘萬元、銀行貸欵於合作社、月息八釐、合作社轉貸於社員農民、加爲一分二釐、所贏四釐、以百分之二十作各社公積金、百分之二十爲業務社員報酬費、餘爲各社義務敎育基金、農民副產、以養豬爲大宗、現已由民敎館長楊興榮向定縣購得美國波支豬種數頭、擬改良豬種、以資蕃殖、許多貧苦農婦、多在富有之家充當傭役、俗謂「上灶」、或經年僱傭、謂之「拉長工」、皆由僱主供給粗劣之食宿、每年僅得工錢五六元、生活亦云苦矣、</p>
<p>各鄉土地、不甚集中、公私方面、皆在法權內行使地權、佃農有永佃權無自由出售權、地價近因交通發達、各渠相繼完工、日有高漲之勢、尤其車站附近地皮、前四五十元一畝者、今已漲至二千元上下、官地分三等、賣出最高價亦達一千八百元之譜、各鄉大家族制尙甚普遍、俗以五世同堂、宗族周卹爲美談、家有家長、族有族長、大小事務、多唯家族長命是聽、小家庭制、城市僅有之、</p>
<p>娛樂團體、縣黨部紐有民衆劇團、城內各古樂社組有古樂會、於每年六月舉行比賽、又有西京金石書盡展覽會及西京書畫學會、隨時供人遊覽、以養成人民審美興趣、社會劇團、秦腔有易俗·三意·正俗·牖民·等社、京調有新舞台、電影有阿房宮·西京電影院、然皆林立於城中、鄕村土台舊劇、不時亦有唱演者、</p>
<p>城區五方雜　、語複雜、其基本方言、如梳如書皆讀爲夫、肉爲巫、水爲匪、咱們爲宰們、俺們爲　們、筆稱生活、（蘭州亦有如此稱者）麫包稱饃饃、又謂舉動遲緩爲暮郞、不服衆爲擰此、挑撥是非爲煽陰火、不潔凈爲窩囊、傲慢爲品麻、守秘密爲捏住、破壞爲失塲、美好爲嫽包包、詩「姣人嫽兮」註嫽好也、亦周秦古音云、</p>

<p>分疏浚築堤建閘等數項</p>
<p>京訊、導進計劃、爲防洪災、便航運、興灌槪、除害興利、兼籌並顧、所有全部計劃、業經詳細研究規定、先後呈奉國府核准、年來導淮會就財力之所及、擇工程急要、而收效最著者、次第實施、茲將已經興辦、及正在進行中之各部工程槪况、簡略述之、</p>
<p>（一）張福河初步疏浚工程張福河是排洪工程中入海水道之第一叚、兼爲灌溉及航運工程中引淮濟運之幹道、自洪澤湖口高良澗起、至入運口碼頭鎭止、全長約三十一公里、年久失修、淤墊日甚、導淮會於民國二十二年一月開工、就原有河綫、展寬浚深、至七月吿成、需欵共四十七萬餘元、工成以後、航運昔爲水枯淺塞者、今則暢流順利、又如去年各地苦旱、但裏運河一帶、全恃此河疏浚後、給水裕如、江北運東、因以大　、本月十四日　淮會各委員、赴淮陰視察船閘工程、並乘輪取道張陳河、參觀洪湖大堤、曾沿河視察、見河面寬廣、水深充足、上游之淮水、由洪澤湖瀉出、經該河下游、直向運河而來、流量甚暢、此乃足證導淮會初步着手之導淮工程、所費有限、巳覺成效卓著矣、</p>
<p>（二）建築邵伯淮陰劉澗船閘運河縱貫蘇省南北、爲淮河下游灌溉航行要道、惟其水勢盛衰、因季節而異、潦則盈溢、旱則枯涸、雖有運河、未能盡其所用、欲盡運河之用、必使其水位維持相當高度、歷冬夏無甚變易、庶重大船舶、得以通年暢行、而運東各縣、亦可兼受灌溉之利、運河中間、舊有石閘多處、均係欄河建築、中留二丈寬之口門、以便過船、每見船隻過閘、恒藉絞盤拖曳、備受危險而迂滯、且水流過閘、常畫夜不息、節洩無方、操縱乏術、導淮會爲改良運河現狀起見、於民國二十三年、先後成立邵伯淮陰劉潤船閘工程局三處、興建新式船閘各一座、船閘之閘室、計長一百公尺、寬十公尺、其容量足供九百噸船一艘、或四十噸船十艘一次過閘之用、閘門以鋼製、閘牆以鋼骨混凝士建造、閘室之兩側、均以塊石鋪、砌作斜坡式、又有輸水管、置於閘室底之兩側、通上下閘門、而設啓閉機關於閘門之兩側、運用極便、閘之上下游最大水位差、在邵伯閘爲七·七公尺、在淮陰劉澗閘、均爲九·二公尺、船閘造價連材料、每座約計六十萬元、又爲建築便利、且不妨害運河目前交通計、均就河灣陸地建築、另鑿引河、以通運河、然後實施基礎打椿工程、迄今三處之引河、均吿完成、邵伯淮陰兩閘上下游、及閘室兩側輸水道下基址大小椿及鋼板椿、亦已全部竣工、現正趕行配紮鋼筋、從事混凝土之工作、日夜進行不輟、預計本年六月底、可以完工、至於劉澗船閘、正在積極進行基樁工程、本年八月亦可完工、三閘完成以後、運河水勢、可終年保持相當深度、自揚子江三江營起、沿運河直至隴海鐵路交點之運河站北、凡三百五十公里、吃水深二公尺、載重九百噸之船隻、可以通航無阻、沿途經過重要城鎭、如邵伯高郵·寳應·淮安·淮陰·宿遷·等地、均爲江北繁庶之區、此後交通之發達、誠可預卜也、</p>
<p>（三）整理運河東西兩堤沿運河東堤、已年久失修、現由江蘇省運河工程局、加高培厚、拆除舊掃、或鋪砌石工、以資掩護、西堤涵洞缺口、多凡二十餘處、均須分別加以堵寒修理、或加配洞門、以維持運河水位、並操縱水流、該項工程、卽由導淮會邵伯船閘工程局兼辦、於寳應高郵昭關壩地方、設立工程事務所三處、全綫同時興工、迄今有已完成者、有正在填築修理者、預期六月以前、均可完工、</p>
<p>（四）與築高郵小船閘運河西堤之高郵越河港、係高寳湖船隻入運河之要道、導淮會現計劃在該處建築一小船閘、以利運輸、、該港口卽待小船閘動工後、開始堵閉、刻正籌備、不日動工、</p>
<p>（五）修建惠濟閘運河碼頭鎭之惠濟閘、爲新疏浚之張福河下游洩水之口門、亟須改建裝配活動閘門、以操縱運河內灌溉水量、及航行水位、該項工程、導淮會業已籌備就緒、卽日興工、</p>
<p>（六）建築三河活動壩洪澤湖具有吐納淮流之功、惟節制水量之法、向僅於蔣壩地方、築設臨時草壩一座、此項草壩、係於臨湖一邊、束蘆柴爲掃、藉以抵抗湖浪、後加附土、以防滲漏、爲合龍便利計、每俟洪湖水位過分低落、方進行修堵、而柴壩質輕、次春水發、卽被冲决、不能因時節制、若遇淮洪漲發、湖水盈堤、則又以壩基壩頭之阻礙水流、致湖水不能暢洩、導淮會因之計劃、另建新式活動壩一座、全長分爲六十孔、每孔寬十公尺、洞高五·五公尺、基礎及墩、均以混凝士建造、門以鋼製、各各活動、啟閉自如、約需工欵三百五十萬元、該壩建於三河口南之陸地上、下鑿引河、以通洪澤湖及三河、開挖引河工程、今春已招商投標、需價一百七十餘萬元、導淮會卽在該處、設立三河活動壩工程局、業巳着手與工、該壩成功後、潦則可預洩湖水、以待洪水之停蓄、旱則可預節湖水、以資灌溉、航行之水源、凡吃水二公尺之巨舶、可由長江進三江營、經邵伯淮陰兩船閘、出張福河過洪澤湖、而西達於蚌埠懷遠、平時可攔堵湖水、使經張福河出入海水道、而歸於海、俾入海水道、得受長期之沖刷、而日趨深泓、故該活動壩、實為江海分疏、與灌漑航行計劃中之主要關鍵、不可或緩者也、預計兩年可以完工、</p>
<p>（七）興建楊莊活動壩導淮計劃、旣決定江海分疏之原則、於洪湖口入江水道之三河、已有建築三河活動壩之工程、以資節洩、而於入海水道之楊莊、亦經决定建築一活動壩、其功效興三河活動壩相同、現正景計籌備、下月間可以招商投標承辦、</p>
<p>（八）興建鹽可船閘鹽河爲聯絡淮海交通之要道、惟鹽河運河之間、向不直接通航、貨物由鹽河來者、先在西壩起岸換船、經廢黄河駁運十餘里、再度換船、始達運河、甚感不便、導淮會乃計劃在楊莊附近、建一新式船閘、以便鹽運兩河、直接通航、至於船閘設計、與淮陰所建築者相仿、一俟淮陰船閘完工、卽可繼續開始與建、</p>
<p>（九）建築劉老澗洩水閘沂水含沙甚多、且中途假道於中運河、挾沙南行、爲害於下游頗烈、爲防止阻遏計、導淮會于劉老澗地方、現已建築船閘一座、阻其濁水南下、而江蘇省政府亦已將沂水歸海要道之六塘河、整理完成、則六塘河與運河間之新洩水閘之建築、實屬必要、按劉老澗舊有九孔閘一座、爲洩沂水入六塘河之用、嗣改爲滾水壩、該壩傾圯後、均用草壩須年啟年堵、仍不能盡蓄洩之功、現經計劃在劉潤船閘上游、建一新式洩水閘、全長凡十孔、具一千立方公尺之洩量、待劉老澗船閘完工、卽從事興建、</p>
<p>（十）導進入海工程淮水出路、旣惟入江入海兩途、但全部入江恐江不易勝任、全部入海、則工費浩大、不合經濟原理、權衡輕重、詳究得失、决以江海分疏爲原則、其入海水道、由張福河經廢黃河至套子入口入海、全長一百七十餘公里、工大欽巨、實非易舉、導淮會乃商得江蘇省政府之同意、由省府辦理該項工程之實施事宜、上起淮陰西北之楊莊、下迄阜寗東北之套子口、徵集工夫十六萬人、到工工作、每年利用十月至翌年五月農隙時間、挖掘土方、全部工程、預計在二十五年五月可以完工、</p>

<p>査勘報吿書摘要</p>
<p>鎭江訊、蘇省前有人建識鐵部、與築口（口岸）東（東台）鐵路、鐵部曾派員査勘、鎭江商會因口東鐵路地位孤立、於上月擬具興築鎭東鐵路意見、呈請鐵部更改路綫、經該部再度派員査勘、結果認爲確有更改必要、現正積極進行、以期早日實現、該査勘員並擬具查勘報吿害、共分十章、計一、總論、二、修築口東鐵路與鎭東鐵路之比較、三、裏下河之地勢及其經濟概况、四、裏下河之交通狀况及水陸運輸之比較、五、裏下河新墾區計劃及其與鐵路之關係、六、淮南鹽產情形及其與鐵路之關係、七、鎭東鐵路路綫及工程計劃、八、鎭江碼頭景備及過江費之規定、九、鎮東鐵路工程預算及客貨運輸與營業用欵之預測、十、結論、長約二萬餘言、茲摘要錄之如次、</p>
<p>査勘總論　蘇省人士鑒於裏下河區交通之重要、擬議建築口東鐵路、起口岸經泰縣至東台、計長八十公里、建築費三百萬元、預測盈餘五十餘萬元、茲經此次査勘結果、以爲裏下河區人口之衆、農產之豐、確有建築鐵路必要、且爲促成新墾區計劃起見、鐵路建築關係尤切、惟口東路綫地位孤立、將來殊難發展、且與京滬路營業影響甚大、故於査勘口東路綫之餘、另勘鎮江至泰縣一綫、擬具鎭東鐵路計劃、以資比較、此綫起鎭江對岸之七壕口、經江都仙女廟泰縣至東臺、長一百二十八公里、估計工程費四百五十三萬元、兩年可以竣工、預測收入一百三十三萬七千元、營業用欵五十七萬二千八百元、利息十六萬二千元、盈餘約四十萬二千二百元、似此計劃、可與京滬聯絡、互相培養、兼能繁榮鎮江江都兩埠、倘於全綫竣工以後、再由東台向北延築至鹽城或單寗、則縈業當史見發達、而無疑也、</p>
<p>兩路比較　江蘇北部東起東海西迄運河、北達淤黄河、南至長江、包括阜寗鹽城東台泰縣興化各縣、總稱裏下河、其東西北三面交通不便故以長江沿岸之霍家橋口岸天生港三埠爲其出入門戶、所有大江輪船均在此停怕、以資聯絡、所有天生港至東台之路綫、即爲通楡鐵路、此綫至今已無討論必要、霍家橋地屬江都、與七壕地位相同、茲將口東鎭東兩鐵路比校如下、（一）口東鐵路全長僅八十公里、其南端由口岸至丹陽尙有五十公里、北端由東台至海州尙有二百七十公里、自身路綫甚短、而又孤立、不如改經江都至鎭江對岸之七壕口、與京滬路隔江聯運而為京滬之培養綫、（二）鎭江為江蘇省會、亦為長江巨埠、江北鐵路　當在此聯絡、可得商業運輸之利、亦可收軍事政治控制之宜、故當棄口東路而取鎭東路、（三）京滬鐵路北通津浦、南接京蕪、東迄滬杭甬杭江等綫、綿延千里、鎭東鐵路雖在對岸、可興已成諸鐵路作相當之聯絡、不至職口東鐵路地位之孤立、（四）鎭東鐵路如出江都往西延築、經儀徽·六合·至浦口、則與津浦鐵路接軌、旣能與華北各路聯絡、亦可利用首都輪渡與江南各路這車、所有江都浦口一綫、雖與長江平行、但在軍事方面、頗爲重要、將來亦有建築之可能、（五）江都爲江北巨邑、地當運河入江之口、海關未以前地位優越、自津浦鐵路建築以後、　商業日衰、如果建築口東鐵路、則鎭江與江都兩埠、將益見衰落、故將鐵路改綫、經江都至七壕口、不特恢復鎭江江都之繁榮、益且利用兩埠現有之繁盛地位、輔鐵路之營業、（六）現在裏下河交通、多有經鎭江轉京滬路而至各埠者、如築口東鐵路、則口岸與他埠之聯絡、必利用水運、而奪京滬路原有之營業、故擬改綫至鎭江北岸而吸收水運、</p>
<p>鎮東路綫　鎭東鐵路綫擬自鎭江對岸之七壕口丐點、於江岸建　船一座、以便停船、車站設備、擬從樸簡、路綫由此向北至江都城東南建江都車站、江都縣城東南兩面均臨運河、輪船碼頭均在福運門外、由福運門擺渡而南、即為鎭揚汽車公司之終點、其西約半里、現正建造鐵橋、不久即可完成、將來鐵路旅客、可經此橋進城、鐵路旣出江都站、即東北行而東折經萬福橋、（四百五十七公尺）石洋溝橋、（一百八十一公尺）董家橋、（八二虎一八公尺）七閘橋（約六十七公尺）五座西至仙女廟、五橋共長給八百三十三公尺、除石洋溝橋離水面凈空應為九公尺、以便航行外、其餘各橋均不通航、倘互段改由嚴家橋小擺度兩處經過、則僅建橋兩座、長共七百五十三公尺、但必須提高嚴家橋、以利航行、將來應將此兩綫切實比較、以資取舍、路綫旣出仙女廟、即由沿通揚運河兩岸、經宜陵至泰縣城內、泰縣繁盛市面及輪船碼頭、均位於城北、其碼頭有上河壩下河壩之分、所有停泊由泰縣上溯於長江之輪船、是爲上河碼頭、所有停泊由泰縣下趨於東臺興化之輪船、是爲下河碼頭、上河下河本可彼此相通、但以水道經過城市、漸爲居民淤塞、日久即相隔絕、故客運貨運、均當在此盤壩轉換輪船、此點實為裏下河交通之重大障礙也、鐵路車站因地勢之關係、即設於城內、路線即在泰縣跨越通揚運河、沿其北岸東行經姜堰而北折、經劉家墩周家舍至時壞東之稽家樓、此段路線雖比由泰縣東南行經李家堡夏朱舍舒家舍至稽家樓之綫略長、但其地勢較高、且經姜堰時堰大鎭、是其優點將來亦可互爲比較、路綫出積家樓即向北徧東行沿鹽運河東岸、直抵東台縣縣南、建東台車站、將來如計劃沿築至鹽城、即可由此向北展長、</p>
<p>客貨運輸　鎭東路綫與已成鐵路不相接軌、倘建羣鐵路以省經費、亦無不可、但爲將來發達起見、暫擬寬軌計劃、建築費四百五十三萬元、至客貨運輸之預測、本極困難、茲就現在水運情形、估計鐵路客運約可得八九〇〇〇〇〇〇延噸公里、又鎭揚汽車現在票價每客一元、如通鐵路每客二角已足、假定全年可得六二二〇〇〇〇延噸公里、共計爲九五一二〇〇〇〇公里、在此全數中、假定其三分之一爲四等客、每人每公里作六　計算、則可得票價一九〇〇〇〇元、其三分之二爲三等客、每人每公里作一分計算、可得票價六三四〇〇〇元、共計客票收入約爲八二四〇〇〇元、貨運估計全路約爲六一八七〇〇〇〇延噸公里、每噸每公里以八釐三毫計算、可得五一三〇〇〇元、客貨運合計每年可得一三三三七〇〇〇元、</p>
<p>査勘結論　鎭東鐵路之經濟情形、與工程概况已如上述、惟以忽促査勘、未盡精確、至以爲慮、且此次査勘、尙未携帶儀器、作地形之測量、蓋因該區地勢平坦、並無山陵、且蘇省建設廳所存有一萬份之實測地圖、供爲設計、精確有餘、至客貨運收入、及營業用欵兩項、雖未敢斷其必合實用、但均逐項分析、使審核者有所依據、加以補充修正、不難得到準確結果、倘此項運輸預測、與將來營業進欵、不相出入、則該路自身經濟、除付息以外、每年尙能還本四十萬元、倘所估之額、超出實際通車之始、未能按額還債、則政府爲裏下河之交通、及發達該區經濟起見、均有建築鐵路之必要、且此路建築實爲京滬鐵路之培養綫、估計京滬全年可增加客運一五八〇〇〇〇〇〇延噸公里、貨運六六〇〇〇〇〇〇延噸公里、合計兩項收入、不在一百萬元以下、故鎭東鐵路之建築、其自身之利益雖徵、而其利益於社會、與培養京滬營業則甚大也、</p>

<p>乙　國內經濟之不景氣</p>
<p>今試返觀我國經濟現狀、果何若　、銀行業听受之影響又何若歟、銀元匯率、以外滙伸畏之故、轉見短縮無論矣、就生產物價貿易等重要事項言之、其略如次、</p>
<p>（一）主要糧食生產、祇占上年百分之八二、（由中央農業實騐所估計推算）進口洋米價値、雖比上年减少約八千餘萬元、小麥亦减少約五千餘萬元、麵粉减少約二千萬元、而上半年各地農產物平均指數、比上年同時降低百分之二十以上、麵粉每袋曾小至一元九角左右、</p>
<p>（二）棉花產量、據今年估計、雖比上年增多約一百數十萬擔、價格亦因銀行與合作社之協助、曾見較好、而全年標準花、平均市價、尙比上年下跌七角九分、進口洋棉、則因關稅增加之故、比上年减少約値洋八百八十萬元、</p>
<p>（三）棉紗產量、因全國紗廠有每週减工之舉、存底轉少於上年、最小價曾跌至一百七十元、關內全年標準紗、平均市價、比上年下跌十九元六角七分、進口數量、因有在華外商紗廠出品、尙難計算、惟棉紗統制、則已有委員會之組織、</p>
<p>（四）生絲、因絲市慘落、絲廠多數停工、產銷均减、出口價値、比上年减少約二千八百萬餘元、上海洋莊絲市、不論黃白上下等絲經、均見銳跌、八九月間、中等廠經、平均市價四百六十元、比十年同時跌去三百餘元、（生絲出口公會記錄）絲繭統制尙屬初步、</p>
<p>（五）茶葉、因主要產茶區之安徽、去冬天寒受凍、收穫甚歉、據估計祗十　萬擔左右、幸紅茶英俄銷路轉旺、出口增加、市價亦高、惟錄茶則價格大跌、外銷亦减、統計出口之茶、約値洋三千六百萬元、比上年約增二百萬元、全年總計、輸出入貿易均見减縮、而入超仍達四萬九千四百餘萬元之鉅、</p>
<p>總而言之、生產减少、物價跌落、匯率短縮、貿易逆調、至此已極、農村經濟、幾瀕破產、人民之購買力、自益貧弱、馴至市面景氣、一落千丈、都市房地產價格大跌、失業因以增加、信用愈見緊縮、初則內地資金、集中都市、拆息低至白偕、繼則白銀外流、銀根緊迫、日拆高至六角、蓋自六月以後、美國收買白銀、上海銀價、常小於英美、利之所在、輸出之銀、爲額甚鉅、雖經政府徵收銀稅並取締標金投機、規定平滙平市等辦法、以期統制、各省亦限制銀元出口、要於大局補救無多、全國白銀出超、共値銀元　萬五千九百餘萬元、年終、上海存底銀元、不過二萬五千一百餘萬元、連銀兩大條廠條等併計、約祇三萬三千五百萬元、比本年最高存額、减少二萬六千萬元、存底旣薄、銀根愈緊、遂釀成都市金融極度緊迫之現象、國際經濟政策、不利於我國之經濟界者既如彼、景響於上海之金融業者又若此、應付之難、可槪見矣、（未完）</p>

<p>— 大木</p>
<p>每個星期尾的晚上，我們總中在茶舞會中消磨兩個鐘頭。一般的說來，還算是最便宜的娛樂亨受，三四個混熟了的朋友，在那充溢着刺激性味的屋子裏，用高雅而自然的姿態，佔據一張小圓桌，坐着，喝着濃郁的咖啡，嘗着精織的嵌花西點，吸着自己所愛吸而帶在衣袋裏的烟捲。</p>
<p>只要逢到那支Whistling　In　Dark的樂此上塲，就像發下總動員命令似的，舞侶跟舞侶會在黑暗中互相擠撞了，脚步還沒熟的小夥子是不肯放過這一塲的，色情迷醉者亦不肯放過這一塲的，狐步舞有熟戀感，這一塲有更柔媚的幽情感。我的朋友都擁着各個所愛的對象混進黑暗中去了。</p>
<p>獨個子支撑着下巴坐着，冷淸淸地，瞧着眼前那圈男和女混合成的大漩渦，旋過來又旋過去。可是，就有一個緊迫在漩渦之旁的低着腦袋的姑娘流進我眼簾來了，伊亦獨個子坐着，跟我一樣，冷淸淸地。可是，伊是刺激和溫柔的出賣者，在這樣有吸引力的塲子裏，伊仍被遺棄着。爲什麽呵？我開始疑惑，覺得伊的孤獨跟我是兩樣味兒的，伊深鎖着愁眉，許是苦味吧！</p>
<p>然而，我的朋友不肯原諒伊，「有什麽使人威動的地方呢？連一襲比較入眼的時裝都沒有。」大家都這樣冷笑着說。可是，我却爲伊慶幸，「時裝救了伊的肉體。」我默頌着那沒有時裝的舞女。</p>
<h3 id="c170">金魚漫話 <a href="#c170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— 吳吉人</p>
<p>日前得福建南台陳蟄廬先生函，承垂詢金魚生白點後之治療方法，爰就管見所及，用貢一二。</p>
<p>魚身白點，初起細不可辨，漸顯而漸多，按此種白點，並非體內所發出，乃係一種細菌，用顯微鏡照視，卽可證明，嘴着魚膚，深透肉層，蔓延極速，不崇朝可傳遍全缸。防禦之法，第一須隔離，不使與健魚接近。第二不可換水，任其在原水中存留，如換水，則愈換愈速其死。第三不給食，須長期停止，非使魚病全退，（已不見白點，）色澤復元，（魚病則色褪、無先前光澤，）方可照常飼養。第四多受日光照射，白點經日光射照，逐漸能成紅色，由紅而轉成灰褐，此卽細菌枯斃之表現，病後如仍給食，則魚身滋養富足，細菌能更長成，不特難治，且必蔓延周身而死。愚以爲治白點法，除速隔離，停食，不換水，多照射外，無他法。</p>
<p>魚患白點，何以多從北方魚身而起，亦自有故，北魚南運，都由輪來，裝以木桶，桶之面積，試言平時可容百尾，而彼輩於裝輪時、則非置五六百不可，蓋使數量多而佔器少也。惟魚多器小必浮頭，乃時加生水，以調濟之，輪行多日，病象已伏，到滬，換以此間之水，初似甚活潑，乃照常飼養矣。豈知不然，歷時未久，卽陸續僵去，間或有延至過年者，（運魚都在冬季，）一到桃花水發，則北魚未有不全斃者。其病象有長白點，間亦有發寒腐者，甚且無所表現，十九不能倖免。</p>
<p>第依據上述，則北魚萬不能南運矣。曰，否，其法維何，卽魚運到後，安入缸中，終此一冬，不稍予食，非經春雷發動，春雨屢經後，始可給食，似此運魚非但無白點病，且能服南方地氣矣。或曰，經冬不食，豈不瘦損乎？曰，無妨也，故購北方魚種者，非經寒暑兩關，不能服地氣明矣。</p>
<p>陳君又詢，間有魚尾生虫，伏於粘膜之內，久則出血，此虫狀如蚯蚓，大纔如綫，長幾及寸，剔拔後卽愈，尙不爲害。按此名螞蝗，蘇地亦誠有之，大都係水蛆中混進魚缸，給食時稍加注意，立卽剔除，無大碍也。</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>關於鳳鞋的叙述：火槪已沒有什麽可寫了，現在祗有最後的一點，再可以說一說。那就是鞋子和時令的關係。我們平民所穿的鞋子、尙且有棉鞋，夾鞋、紗鞋等等之分，何况太后呢？在本書第八章裏，我曾經說過宮中的衣服的質料·不但須因時令而變換，便是衣上繡的花朵，也各有規定；這鞋子上也是如此，可以無庸再說。只講冬天裏太后所御用的鳳鞋。太后當然是不要穿那種很笨重的棉鞋的、所以伊的鞋子裏，都是襯的上好的絲棉，鞋口上又有一圈皮釘着，這圈皮自然又是銀鼠紫貂之類了。</p>
<p>太后所雇用的藝工是全部安頓在萬壽山的背後的，就在昆明湖的對面一帶；這一帶的山坡上，很齊整地隔成了幾座大小相仿的宮院，每一座宮院內住着每一種工藝的藝工，絕不相混，例如管育蠶的就有一座專用的宮院，而那些製絲的藝工也自有伊們的住處和工作的塲所，製鞋的又另有一處了。雖然相離甚近，但都各立門戶，像幾家獨立的工塲一樣。所以這一部份的頤和園，可說是小規模的工業區；裏而的藝工們，終年像一羣羣蜜蜂似的忙亂着。不過這裏所有的出品，却和全中國內無論那一家工塲的出品大有不同：第一是宮內所需要的絲，或繭子，或鳳鞋，都不是很單純的一種或兩種，往往是數百種，數千種，每種却又不必多，只需很精緻的一二件；第二是宮內的藝工的技術，經實地比較結果，確是高於他處一切的工人。（三〇二）</p>

<p>— 王葛大</p>
<p>我常時說的一周世勳是我們最有趣的領導，因爲連一句戲言從他那靈活的嘴裏說出來，都是含有哲理或是心理學的。由這次我們的旅杭遊桯中，我益覺得我這話是並沒有一些謬讚他」。</p>
<p>當我們一行的行踪到達了九溪十八澗的中途時，世動的妙語開塲了，他說，朋友們！「你們可知道嗎？杭州是由三種人的組合而成的，一種是「死人」，一種是「半死人」，一種是「活人」，有死人才有「貞節牌坊古墳祠堂」，有半死人才有「叢林寺院敎堂廟觀，有活人才有「尋春旅行香汛禮佛一，若三缺一，即不成其爲杭州一，這話，我們當然找不出一個更好的理由去否認它，從一陣是是聲中，跟着我們的領導前進。</p>
<p>世勳有茶癖，所以便把我們一行人領帶到理安寺，這裏的茶雖沒有虎跑著名，可是水的來源，却是一而二二而一，處境確更比虎跑來得幽靜，尤其是那些站立得恭恭敬敬排着隊伍在迎接你的楠林，多麽的使人流連。我們走進寺院時，便有知客來招待，當然我們少不得又要品評一下，這裏的香茗，况且我們已是口渴到了頂點的時候。在這時世勳便繼續的大談其司的克在杭州的心理學了，又是一段有趣味的談話，而値得作爲遊杭指南的。</p>
<p>他說「人們一到了杭州，爲着要達到他們遊山的目的的關係，祇要一到了杭州，便想着他自己得預先備就一根司的克，因爲有了它，便可以在遊山時帮助人們「一臂之力」，其實暗地裏，拿司的克的人們，已受着不少的捐失，而使杭州的一般商人和販夫走卒，車夫船家，獲得他們所稱爲「旺月」的冀望，不信你們可以嘗試，假使你拿着一根司的克走在湖濱，馬上就會有成羣結隊的車夫和船家，緊緊的跟在你的身後，背念他們那標語式的遊程，「先生，要勿要車子（或船）靈隱，虎跑，三天竺，九溪十八澗，黃龍洞，烟霞洞，便宜點，要勿要？「如其你不堅决的表示不要，他們也許會跟你到一里路以外，要是你還了他一個價，那你就得繼續當心你的衣裳被他們由拉扯而到分裂，結果你所出的價錢，萬一成交了，總比不拿司的克的費些。</p>
<p>假使你在街坊上步行，那來那些所謂三冬靠一春的商店夥計，又會向兜攬說「先生，要勿要買點香籃，佛珠，西湖藕粉，香榧子」，要是成交了，又得比不拿司的克的貴一些。</p>
<p>總之，司的克在杭州，果然足以扶助人們的遊行，也就是杭州人場給外來的遊人的商標，表面上他們對拿司的克的人特別殷勤的招待，實際上就得要你多損失些，因爲在杭州的杭州人，或是久住在杭州的外省人，除了少數的龍鍾老翁是不拿司的克的，不然，馬路上成年的祇見三條腿了。天下事有利必有弊，司的克在杭州其一也，世勳的一番話，不啻又給了我們旅行杭州的一個好敎訓，</p>

<p>第十二回　慚愧沒衣裳垂帷避各辛勤省膏火拂曉抄畫</p>
<p>程志前道：這樣說來，你倒是位熱心敎育的同志我却有關於西北敎育的幾個問題，和你老哥討論討論，你可肯賜敎？這兩句話提起了有客的興趣，不要十北海補習功課了。他兩人是各坐了桌子一方的，他也就拖了椅子，坐在正面，掀着衣袖道：賜敎兩個字說不到，我們來研究研究。程君是到這裏來考査敎育的，你先把你的感想，說給我聽聽。志前道：整個兒敎育，說起來，那話就太長了。還是說幾個有趣味的問題罷。我向西去，是一直到了靑海寗夏的，那種地方，當然說不到敎育，就說這西去不遠二三百里，我到了一個縣城。這縣是很荒凉的，站在高處，人家的屋脊，可以一望之下，口裏報出數目來。但是究兌是個縣城，不能不有一所學校。在一所古廟大門外，去了廟額，也像東方一樣，藍底子白字，懸了一塊校牌，尊者縣立第一小學。當時我進去參觀，在廟門口碰到一位三十附近的人，穿了藍布襖褲，身上不少的墨水點。頭上光頭，沒有辮子和半邊頸的長頭髮，在這裏，决定了就是個讀書的人。我就對他說，我是來參觀的，閣下是不是這裏的敎職員？可是他的答復，却出乎我意料之外，他却是這裏的學生。我也知道西北的學生，是不可以論年齡的，但是年齡要相差到這個樣子遠，那是我未到此以前，所不相信的。（一九二）</p>

<p>市敎局昨召遊藝人員談話會　由潘局長報吿識字運動意義</p>
<p>本市識字敎育委員會、定五月一日起舉行識字運動宣傳週、市敎育局於昨日上午九時特召集全市游藝界代表談話會、由潘局長報吿、自五一起全市遊藝人員總動員宣傳識字運動、茲分誌詳情如次、</p>
<p>出度代表　昨日出席者計市敎育局潘局長·蔣科長·戲曲審査委員呂海瀾·丁守棠·徐公萬·袁增煜·孫育才·程鳳翔·彭去疾·曁申曲歌劇硏究會·蘇灘歌劇硏究會·滑　獨脚戲硏究會·潤餘社評　彈詞硏究會·光裕社·四明文戲研究會·永裕社申江說書研究會·維揚評話改進會·及天韻樓·先施樂園·新新花園·大世界·福安游藝塲等各話劇社代表一百餘人、</p>
<p>局長報告　主席潘局長報吿略調今天市敎局請全上海遊藝界人員到此舉行談話會、一方面商量改進游藝問題、同時請各位贊助本市舉辦之識字運動、大家知道目前國家環境日益危險、欲救中國必須要全國人民共同努力、但要使全國人民來救國、應先使他們明瞭國家的危險和救國的重要、要使他們能明瞭、除掉用直接談話以指示外、欲其普遍有效、就得靠文字、中國不識字者從前有百分之八十以上、這幾年來較有進步、也仍有百分之七十以上、約計三萬萬以上的人民是不識字者、如何使他們知道國家、</p>
<p>各國情形　一個國家的强弱貧富與識字很有關係、日本人民百分之九十以七是識字的、所以能成爲强國、識字是一個國家文明的慕礎、英美法各國的國民都是大多數識字的、蘇俄和土耳其從前也是有百分之八十以上的不識字者、但自歐洲大戰後至今、僅十七年之努力結果繼成百分之八十以上是識字者、所以俄國現在的國勢和從前大不相同、而土耳其現在也變成新興的國家、一雪從前近東病夫之護、中國自革命至今已有二十四年了、但我們的識字者、算他是有進步也不過百分之十而已、依此比例推算、要使百分之八十以上人民識字、不知要到何年何月了、但國際的情勢是不能容我們再等了、一定要想一個快的進步方法、使在最短期間把不識字者能識字、</p>
<p>識字運動　因此中央在幾年以前規定了七種救國運動、而第一種就是識字運動、可見其重要、但必須大家去做才能做到、所以各地現在都在推行識字運動、上海市的識字運動、現在市政府聯合各級黨部各機關各團體合作、要大規模的而且永久的去做、由市府指撥經費辦識字學校、强迫不識字者入校、讀二個月書可識六百至七百字、每天讀一小時、並不妨碍他們的工作時間、不收費用、書籍奉送、這識字學校約計二百所、每校六班、每班五十人、分六小時敎授、共計三百人、二百校就有六萬人、二偭月畢業、十二個月就有三十六萬人、這樣一年以後不識字者都可識六百字了、我們一方面編一種讀物、以此六百字爲基礎、逐漸參人其他生字、使能一天天進步、</p>
<p>擴大宣傳　是項運動定本年七月一日開始、但在七月一日以前、現在先要使全上海無論男女老少都知道、不識字者都願意來讀書識字者都願意來帮助做事、故有擴大的官傳、並希望遊藝界諸位能盡力帮助、現自五月一日至五月七日爲識字運動宣傳週、各位在此七日內無論在何時何地有機會表演或說話的時候、要盡量把識字意義穿揷進去、這就是帮助國家、並定五月二日爲電播宣傳日、已由播音業同業公會推定中西電台在這一天專播識字宣傳節目、同時各電臺亦轉播此節目、五月四日為遊藝宣傳日、這一天全市遊藝人員要總動員宣傳、材料已由識字敎育委員會製定大綱供各位參考、要一方面使不識字者願意去識字、一方面使識字者願意去敎不識字者而不做守智奴、希望各位能盡力做去、實為國家民族之福云、</p>

<p>葡隊守門及內衛之庸俗、實爲致敗主因、F馬山兄及維克托二衛等於虛設、幾無阻擋能力、一失再失、創鉅深痛、後由L馬山兒及雷米狄調駐後方、頓時壁壘森嚴、使中華健兒、無機可圖、而前鋒柯拉沙等囚無後顧之憂、攻勢亦猛、下半時中、中華受敵時多、進攻時少、終以葡隊射門不佳、屢失機會、兩翼無能、不免爲之减色、</p>

<h3 id="c194">發展出口貿易之新途徑（續） <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 孔滌庵</p>
<p>更就貿易金融方面言之，其痛感必要之程度，亦不相多讓。蓋國外匯兌業務之消長，恒隨貿易業之發達與否爲轉移。滙兌銀行主要獲利之泉源，厥爲貼現進出口滙票。故兩者關係之密切，如唇齒之相倚然，斷未有貿易萎縮而經營外滙之銀行獨能保持贏益也。因之在貿易商方面，其進出口貨物上資金之調動，固須仰給於國外滙兌銀行，足以左右其營業上之生命，而附隨於輸出貿易上之信用危險，亦與滙兌銀行本身有重大影響。若此種危險之結果，能設法不使外滙銀行負擔其資任之一部分，則彼等自敢放膽做去，以簡捷之方法與出口商以融通便利矣。</p>
<p>進出口貿易中貨欵之淸償，大都以押滙之方法行之。而經營國外滙兌之銀行，其購買押滙票據也，因防止萬一之危險起見，通常多利用押滙信用證（Documentary　Letter　of　Credit），即此種票據，因由發行信用證之銀行負保證責任，故樂於購入之，以其票面所開金額交給於持票人，否則又誰肯問津。惟發行信用證之銀行，旣負此保證責任，則對於委託人之進口商，自必向之徵牧一定發行手續費，或其他承受費，以爲特別之報償，如此則進口商因覺負擔之過重，必不敢貿然進貨，而輸出貿易遂緣之橫生阻碍矣。</p>
<p>欲除夫上述障礙，俾一國出口貿易，得以圓滑進行，其法惟有舉辦輸出信用保險。顧此種制度，在技術方面，測定危險，至不容易，若任由私人舉辦，恐財力有所不逮。故今日多數國家，均由政府出而擔任。以下特就英德諸國辦理經過之情形，略述其大概焉。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>輸出信用保險制度，濫觴於英。當一九一九年英國商部，硏究其對中歐貿易所以减退之原因，而歸其結論於出口商資金之窘乏。於是乃於是年九月廿日公布海外貿易條例，（TheOversea　Trade　Act），由國庫另提二千五百萬鎊，在貨價百分之八〇限度，專以貸放於經營出口貿易之商人。此法在出口商方面，雖因是暫獲資金融通之便利，而對於輸出票據之保證，及信用危險之保險等則仍付缺如。故與全國商會聯合會協議後，乃改訂法律，於一九二一年六月公布海外貿易信用保險法，（TheOversea　Trade　Credit　Insurance　Amendment　Act））另於商部內特設一課以司理之，凡出口商人以貨物售與海外商人；其所發之輸出票據，期限在一年以內者，由政府按照票面金額，全部爲之保證；超過一年，則以百分之八五爲限度。同時規定政府對於發票人之出口商在前者保有百分之五七。五，在後者百分之四二·五之追索權。其適用範圍，初僅限於歐洲中南部諸國，後乃擴至印度錫鬧及遠東各國。至一九二五年，除蘇俄外，輸往海外之貨物，均得聲請承保。同時政府復於一九二五年七月召集全國實業家銀行家及保險官等組織委員會討論（一）舉辦輸出信用保險後其及於出口貿易之利益如何？（二）爲補助現存之便益起見，政府是否有探取他種手段之必要？（三）倘認有必要其具體之方法如何等。經該會硏究結果於翌年三月，提出下列意見：</p>
<p>（一）在健實之輸出貿易，信用保險，最屬切要。</p>
<p>（二）現行制度，尙未能滿足輸出商要求。</p>
<p>（三）在不惹起濫行交易之範圍內，政府應設法擴張現行制度。</p>
<p>因之乃建議政府擬定三種辦法，即</p>
<p>甲、在輸出商發行之票據，如爲WithoutRecourse式（即對於發票人無追索權者）由政府按照票面金額，與以最高百分之七五之保證，換言之，日後付欵人之海外進口商，如拒絕支付，則貼現該項票據之銀行，可向請求償還其所保證之金額，而以他法另向出口商索取之　。</p>
<p>乙、反之，輸出商發行之票據，如爲（With　full　recourse）式（即對於票面金額；發票人負有償還請求義務者）。由政府按照票面所開金額全部保證之。此種辦法，驟觀之，出口商因負有票面金額全部償還之義務，似仍絲毫未蒙有保險之利益。然票據經政府保證後，可以無須另提抵押品，請求銀行貼現，其便利固亦甚大也。</p>
<p>丙、參酌上述二者，輸出商發行之票據，或爲（Without　recourse），或與保險當局恊議其所負償還義務程度後，由政府依其希望，爲之保證票面之全部或一部。</p>
<p>政府於一九二六年七月即根據此種提議實行，至一九二七年更擴張保險課業務，由出口商與保險課約定以其所往來之各進口商爲對象，訂立總括的保險契約，而定一保證限度；遇有發行押滙票據時，即通知保險課，以所定限度內爲之保證，倘出口商並不發行票據，或發行之票據金額甚少時，則政府對於已收之保險費得退還其一部分焉。</p>
<p>出口商與政府所訂之契約其最通行者！現在約有二種：一則出口商繳付保險費後，其發行之押滙票據，如被他國之進口商拒絕付欵時，由政府按照票面金額賠償百分之七，五一則更對於出口商往來之銀行，亦與一定金額之無條件付欵保證，故尤與輸出商以獲得融通資金之便利也。至保證期間隨貨物之種類而異，最長者爲機械，以五年爲最大限度。最低如疋頭類，則僅六個月。此制自施行以來已逾十五年，原定以一九三五年年底止爲實施期間，而際此世界經濟尙未脫離恐慌之環境下，對此振興貿易之有效方法，其必賡續辦理，可無疑議者也。</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>繼英而起以輸出信用保險爲振興海外貿易之策者，則始自德國。德之私人保險公司如海爾滿信用保險公司Hermes　Kuditvcricherrungbank法郞克福一般保險公司FrankfurterAllgeneineVersicherungsgesell　chait從前本承保輸出滙票之危險，然因收費過昂，成效未彰。故一九二二年乃由政府起而與海爾滿公司合作，先以三千萬馬克爲基金，於一九二二年舉辦對俄輸出長期信用保險。嗣後陸續增加，至一九二七年則推及於其他各國。其法於出口商發裝貨物於國外買主時，即得以發貨車爲物證，持向保險公司投保。保險公司除保留一部分外，可以其承保額之一半；請求政府設立之輸出信用保險局Export　Kredit－Verickerung－Stelle　轉保，而以國家爲再保險人。日後該項貨物之價欵，倘竟無法收回致損失過大，則其超過部分，全由政府負賠償之責。故不特出口商人因有此保障以訂立輸出信用保險契約，爲唯一之防身武器。即保險公司，亦可不間貨物之果售與何種地位之商人，與夫保險金額之過大；而有所躊躇也。且投保以後出口商如以保險單向銀行作抵押，保險公司即可爲之證明，於發生損失將賠償欵交付持單之銀行，如此則一轉移間，出口商對於輸出資金之周轉，不　已受政府之前貸，自可從容收貨矣。</p>
<p>除英德外，瑞典·挪威·意大利·及奧地利諸國，亦先後羣起仿行。日本則於一九三〇年五月以輸出補償法之名，舉　此種保險，規定以本國貨物輸往國外指定地域，其所發行之押滙票據，銀行　入後，日後如發生不履行保險，致遭受損失時，由銀行繳納一定補償費，而政府賠貼其損失之七成。施行以來，已越五年，其輸出貿易，日益膨脹，雖原因不止一端，而輸出信用保險，要不失其爲促成此種趨勢之重要因子也。</p>
<p>回顧我國，時至今日，國內經濟狀態，因每年入超類額之繼續增加，現金外流，已漸呈枯絕之勢，此後欲防止經濟崩潰，以平衡國際收支，自當以發展海外貿易爲唯一前提。先由政府仿照各國成例，舉辦輸出信用保險，俾從事出口之商人，得安心以其貨物運銷國外，而與買主以長期信用之便利，如此則外國進口商自盡樂購我國產品，以此行之，則入口貨物罐多，因輸出增加，已足以相抵而有餘，又何患國際貸借之不能平衡乎？然我國今日，海外滙兌銀行僅止一二處，均屬設立未久，對於國外市况之調査，無甚總騐，且直接從事出口貿易者又鮮，　論際茲財政拮据之時，政府無力及此，即令另斥鉅欵，冒險行之，其效果如何，亦仍屬疑問。以吾人之恿，竊謂在此世界經濟，尙呻吟於恐慌狂潮之下，我國一時欲圖輸出增加，事實上殊乏可能，爲今之計，不如先將國內貿易上種種之障碍，如轉口稅及一部分營業稅等，儘先宣吿廢除，使國內生產品得以减輕成本，自由流通：則不必要之洋貨自將乏人顧問：以我國得天之厚，又何患其不能自給自足哉！（完）</p>
<h3 id="c195">今日世界經濟的兩條路綫 <a href="#c195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— 馮次行</p>
<p>今日世界經濟，已很明顯的分爲維持金本位國與停止金本位國的兩大集團。全集團方面，說。。復興世界經濟，在停止金本位國之恢復金本位。紙集團方面說：世界繁榮的恢復，必須金集團也暫時拋棄金本位，一致來提高世界的物價。這二大集團對於這兩條相反的路綫，亦過去的世界經濟會議，已經過熱烈的辯論，迄今仍成爲世界的最大問題。在理論上，這兩條路綫究竟那一條是對的呢？許多的世界經濟學者，正在不斷地繼續討論着。在事實上，今日世界的經濟，是向着那一條的路綫前進着呢？全世界的人們，都在緊張地注視着。四月二十一日華盛頓的電訊，又在傳說美國凖備於最近六個月以內，再召集世界經濟會議，來討論這個問題。</p>
<p>我國目下也正在鬧經濟恐慌，情勢嚴重，不可終日。但是我國的經濟恐慌，决不是我國自己所造成的；確是世界經濟恐慌產物的一種。美國的購銀政策，雖足以助長我國經濟恐慌，使之急速的實現，但是我國經濟恐慌的發生，决不是完全因美國購銀的結果。假使美國不購買現銀，我國會不會遭遇同樣的困難呢？我想時間，或有遲早，恐慌的刦數，恐怕是難以避免的罷！因爲各國貨幣競爭跌價，也會使我國銀幣對外價格逐步高漲，招致同樣的通貨緊縮的結果。所以我們現在與金本位國相同，也彷徨在兩條路綫的歧途之上。一條是固守我們的銀本位，忍耐着期望着等世界繁榮的到來；或美國購銀政策的轉變。一條是禁銀出口，停止兌現，膨脹通貨，脫離世界經濟的　絆，放任國幣價格的暴跌。</p>
<p>但是無論中國，無論世界，上述可走的兩條路綫，都有荊棘，都多危險，所謂都不是頭路。因此大家都徘徊彷徨，徜徉在岐途的上面旣不能進，又不能退，形成種忽左忽右的僵局。現在我們且搬開理論，就實際的統計數字上去觀測各主要國在此恐慌局面下所取的經濟政策的實際效果。事實上吿訴我們减低貨幣價格的國家，對於挽救恐慌，恢復市面，比較的有相當的進展。例如我們研究一九三四年世界貿易的特徵。貨幣跌價國家如美英日本等國的貿易，確有顯著的恢復；而維持金本位國家如法德等國的貿易，　日益萎縮，依然趨向頽勢。査去年世界各國雖盛行滙兌管理，提高關稅，限制輸入、禁止輸入等種種阻害世界貿易進展的方策、但匯價低落的國家、特別如英美兩國的貿易，已逐漸恢復到一九三一年的狀態；日本進步尤速，已打破一九二八年一九二九年的貿易數額。反之，歐洲大陸諸國中，如法國的輸出入，只是傾向我减退之一途；德國雖極力注意改善國際貿易的差數，但是結果終是輸出减退，輸入增加，多年的出超，已一變而爲入超國了。</p>
<p>英國去年輛入額七億三千二百萬鎊，比較一九三三年增加五千七百萬鎊。幟出額四億四千七百萬鎊，增加三千萬鎊。入超額是二億八千五百萬鎊比較一九三三年雖增二千七百萬鎊，但是比較一九三二年則减少一億餘鎊。即在輸出入貿易額增加之條件下，而能减少入超，足見其國內經濟狀態，已有進步。美國去年輸入額十六億五千五百萬元，輸出額二十一億三千四百萬元，比較一九三三年輸入增加一億五百萬元，輸出增加加四億五千九百萬元。出超額爲四億七千九百萬元，比較一九三三年增加加二倍以上（一九三三年爲二億一千五百萬元，）爲一九三〇年以來最高的記錄。日本去年輸入額二十三億千三百萬元，增加三億六千三百萬元。輸出額二十二億元，增加三億三千萬元。入超額爲一億二千三百萬元，比較一九三三年增加四千四百萬元。</p>
<p>以上英美日三國貿易進展之狀態，雖各有其特殊之條件；如英國因渥太華會議之結果，對於加拿大南非澳洲印度以及斯坎狄挪維亞三國間之貿易，異常增進，他如美國努力於南美市塲之發展，日本一意於滿洲市塲之侵略，雖然也都是使他們貿易增進的原因，但是各該國間貨幣的跌價，確實是共通的主要原因。因爲在政治上，雖然有屬地與殖民地的關係，在經濟上那是須要看實際的商業條件如何。譬如本國的貨幣價値高貴，那麽屬地與航民地的人民，必然轉換方向去購買比較便宜的外國貨品，决不能一味用政治的力量，去强迫屬地殖民地的人民，愛用本國物品。因爲這種的强制，是毫無效果的。</p>
<p>一九三二年六七月是世界經濟最不景氣的時候，那時的工業生產力比較一九二九年低落至百分之三十，物價暴跌，失業增加，農村衰微，經濟恐慌現象，瀰漫全球。各國當局與經濟學者，都絞盡腦汁，苦心焦慮，忙着想挽救的方策。不知道經過了多少次舌敝唇焦的論爭辯難，方纔决定了採取一種緩性的通貨膨脹政策，就是使自國的貨幣跌價，以謀開拓過剩生產品的銷路。這樣地行了二三年，終算物價也漸漸地提高了，失業也减少了，一切的經濟狀態都趨向於恢復的途徑。不過這次恢復的進步，是非常緩慢。尤其是美國，他們政府費了幾百萬萬的復興鉅欵，但是所收獲的成績，非常式徵。這是甚麼緣故呢？據世界著名的經濟學者加塞爾敎授的觀察，是歸罪於歐洲法德等國勉强維持金本位，造成國內的緊縮狀態，因爲維持金本位國家的市面依然趨向於不景氣，運帶的使已經拋棄金本位的國家的市面，也不能闊步猛進，恢復展開。所以他主張法德等金本位國家，最好也暫時放棄金本位，與英美日等國家談判各國貨幣相互間的平價，减低金幣的成色，同時恢復金本位。總而言之，他的意見是只有减低各國金幣成色，纔是恢復世界繁榮的唯一途徑。</p>
<p>現在世界通貨制度，大別之可分爲金集團通貨，與紙幣集團通貨二種。美國與德國雖似接近於金集團，但實際决不是金集團中的一員。金集團方面極力主張照從來法定平價，恢復金本位。紙幣集團方面，主張先恢復物價與生產費的往常關係，然後冉安定通貨對於物品的購買力。換言之，主張先提高全般的物價，然後再從事安定。英國的通貨政策，就是後者的代表。現在有許多紙幣國的通貨，都以英鎊爲標準，跟着英鎊昇降。英屬地及瑞典挪威丹麥阿根廷等國，都是英鎊集團的團員。日本匯價向來是跟着英鎊跑的，現在我國的金單位，也是照英鎊合算。其次美元集團的勢力，也狠大。所以照目前形勢，法國等金集團的勢力，是微乎其小：决不及紙幣集團勢力之大。况且照經濟理論，一國的貨幣，是使牠跌價容易，漲價困難。現在紙集團各國貨幣已經跌至六折五折四折不等，美國而且公然在法律上减低了金元的成色，表示决無再照舊平價開禁的意思。所以事實上要想叫紙集團去遷就金集團，是一件辦不到的事情。况且現在紙集團的國家利用貨幣跌價的方法，已收得改進貿易，恢復經濟的實效，眼見得金集團諸國，都沉淪在通貨緊縮，物價下跌，產業不振的狀態中，那裏肯急速恢復金木位，再蹈他們的覆轍。而且現在世界的物價，還沒有達到紙集團各國所希求的地步，他們還正在積極進行各種經濟復興的方法，去提高物價，萬一無效，或者效力狠微，他們也似乎不惜犧牲，再减低他們貨幣的價値。所以他們不但决沒有遷就金集團的意思，而且認定金集團是世界經濟復興的最大障礙。現在世界物價不能積極上漲，是受了金集團的牽扯。紙集團各國各種恢復經濟的努力，因金集團的存在，效果上打了折扣，减色不少。所以他們說：要世界急速的重趨於繫榮之路，那除非是金集團諸國也同時放棄金本位。</p>
<p>金集團的國家，本爲法蘭西意大利比利時荷蘭瑞士德意志等國，而以法國爲領袖，而至現在集團的分子亦有移動了。法國在大戰以後，因農事荒蕪入超增加，法政府又爲復興戰區，發行巨額公債。因此法國貨幣自一九一九年起，開始狂賤暴跌，不堪收拾。人民飽嘗了通貨膨脹的痛苦，直至一九二八年六月，纔將從來法郞的金成分减去百分之八十，恢復了金本位。那時有人說：法郞的價格，實在跌去太多了。但是法國的貿易，倒因此發展，那時英美等國都引起緊縮的狀態。那裏知道過了三年以後，形勢一變，英美等國爲避免緊縮的狀態起見，都陸續放棄了金本位，倒反把法國等造成了緊縮的狀態。紙集團等國的貨幣一天一天跌價，就是金集團等國的貨幣一天一天的漲價。換言之，紙集團的貨幣愈跌，即是以紙集團貨幣計算的金集團貨幣的價格愈貴。這種昂貴，並非自然的，是因爲金集團貨幣可以兌現，跟着現金漲跌。紙集團貨幣對現金跌價，就是對金集團貨幣跌價，所以金價愈漲，金集團貨幣也愈漲，金集團對於金本位的維持，也愈覺困難。因爲人人以爲金集團貨幣的評價太貴，當然都拋棄金集團的貨幣，去換現金銀貨物和紙集團國的紙幣。這種拋棄的事實表現，就是兌現，擠兌，現金流出國外，或窖藏國內，使鈔票的準備金一天天减少。假使金集團國不能應付，就逼着他放棄金本位。現在金本位的國家，時時在這種危險不安的狀態之中。紙集團的國家，間接受了重大的影響。世界的經濟，因此難以急速的恢復，貿易也因此難以合理的進展。</p>
<p>的確現在金集團貨幣的評價，實在過大。據一九三四年九月的統計，金集團貨幣與英鎊的百分比如下：即比利時貨幣比英鎊貴百分之七，意大利貴百分之十三，法蘭西貴百分之十七，荷蘭貴百分之　十二，瑞士貴百分之四十一，德意志貴百分之五十七，這的確是一種極不自然的狀態。金集團國家　不採取同時跌價的辦法，要想用滙兌管理，貿易統制等阻礙國際貿易的方策，去防止紙集團國家的傾銷，是一種逆流的運動，結果一定是失敗的。</p>
<p>本年　月份英倫經濟什誌載有英國經濟專家斯特刺噶蘇氏論文一篇，他也說要恢復世界的繁榮，只有世界各國同時减低金幣成色，同時恢復金本位。據他的統計，現在各國金準備照一九二八年舊成色合算是二十二億七千二百萬鎊。其中金集團國估百分之三十八，美國佔白分之三十三，其餘各國佔百分之二十九。假使各國貨幣的成色，平均减低百分之六十，那麽轉瞬間世界的金準備額，就可增加至四十八億六千三百萬鎊。世界現金缺乏的恐慌，就可烟消雲散。至於實行的步驟，他主張如下：（一）召集國際經濟會議。（二）用减低成色的方法，提高物價。（三）各國在協定的均衡狀態之下，穩定滙價。（四）增進各國中央銀行間之聯絡。（五）努力增加各國中央銀行的金準備。（六）撤廢阻害自由貿易的滙兌管理，進出口限制等等制度。（七）戰債賠欵問題的解决。</p>
<p>現在的世界，依然是在資本主義國家利己的對立時代。倫敦經濟會議的失收，可爲殷鑒。今日的世界經濟，依舊在金集團和低集團對峙的情形之下，過着迷惑沉悶的歲月。不過照好幾個世界著名經濟學者的觀察，都說恢復世界繁榮之路，不是各國相瓦妥協來共同减低金幣成色，恨復金本位；就是金集團國家忍耐不住被迫放棄了金本位，來提高世界一般的物價，然後冉絡續重新恢復金本位，他們都以爲終是不出於這二條路棧。</p>
<h3 id="c196">上海魚市塲與魚行合作之建議 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 陳欽孫</p>
<p>實業部爲振興魚業，在上海創設大規模之魚市塲，建築設備悉屬現代化，頗稱完善。今後魚鮮，可以保藏處理，求善價而沽之；不至有腐敗難以持久，亟圖脫貨，損及血本之事。但以魚市塲之組織，全係官資，而商民不與焉；遂不能得魚業中之共信，形成相與對壘之勢，迄今尙難開辦。竊謂實業部與魚行間，如有誠意無謂之糾紛，唯有確守互信共信之前提，以求合作之道。不然，雙方所謂利魚民者，將使魚民更無所適從也。</p>
<p>魚行領有牙帖，有法律保障之牙商也。魚民冒險出海捕魚，全賴魚行貸以資本，而以售欵備抵。但隨償隨借，終至累積巨數。今上海魚行此項「魚放」，計數共有二百五十萬元，平均每家約十萬元。魚市塲成立之後，魚行或將失其原有之地位，則此一筆魚放作何辦理，諒不忍令魚行獨蒙其損失，致爲魚市進行之累。則何如以原有魚行爲魚市塲之經紀人，經紀人應負推銷全責，所有販戶之帳，均歸經紀人自理；所有以前二百五十萬元魚放之債權，魚行如數移轉於魚市塲承受之。其債權移轉之方式，可由魚市塲呈准主管機關發行一種魚業整理償還債券。此項債券之基金，指定以魚市塲每月所得佣金項下撥充之。上海魚產全年貿易額，據近年統計，平均總値二千萬元，佣金依照成例値百取八，全年收入總計有一百六十萬元，魚市塲與經紀人對於值百取八佣率之分配，吾人假定為五與三之比，則魚市塲佣金凈數收入，全年計有一百萬元，若以其半數計五十萬元撥充此項債券基金，儘可於五年內分期還淸。或以爲魚行所得者，亦僅帳面換爲票面而已，魚行旣居經紀人之職，因乏周旋之現欵，巧婦終靴爲無米之炊。故此項債券，能得有上述的欵充作基金外，應將其全部財產（估計價値超過一百萬元）提供爲優先擔保品，實業部則爲連帶保證人，載明債券。如是：此項債券之物質條件，與精神條件，俱稱完備，　有人持之就商於金融界，金融界當無不樂予周旋，所有困難，迎刃而解，漁業之發展，可預卜也。</p>

<h3 id="c204">語言學家弄文學 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 稜磨</p>
<p>語言學的研究，大致是包括如何把文章寫好在內的。而好的文章，被稱為文學，又是極普通的說法。因此語言學家每自然而然地兼做文學家。在崇拜專家的環境下，一個語言學家的地位也許比一位文學家的地位更好，譬如劉半農以語言學者而被稱為文學家，就有人代他抱怨，可惜。可是一般的趨勢，既是電影明星的風頭比文學家的健，文學家的風頭比專門學者健，是不是有些語言學家為了風頭，就寗願以文學家見知於世，也是可思索的。這雖不能起半農先生於地下而問之，但怕也不缺乏能作一確實的答覆的旁人。</p>
<p>劉薰宇說，中國學科的人兼弄文學的不少其人，但可惜弄科學時就純粹是科學，弄文學時就純粹是文學，都無心於作溝通科學與文學的橋梁（大意）。語言學家的弄文學者，也正如此。但語言學本身就近於是科學與文學間的橋梁，因而語言學家的弄文學時，就純粹是文學，似乎是故意劃清這兩者的界限，其為何如此，是頗難解的。或者就是為不願進象牙之塔。</p>
<p>專門著作原與一般讀物不大調和，在關於語言學的論著很常見的時候，語絲上也載左傳真偽與上古方音，新月上也載入聲嚴攷、那些大著，自然也頗使一般讀者感到厭倦，因而此後除專門學術刊物上很少見關於語言的論著。更進而專門刊特上的語言學的論著，與一般人的興趣相離益遠。其實有關於語言學而為一般人所很注意的問題，非常之多，並不是與一般刊物絕無調相的餘地。向最細之處去研究專門之學，似並不是專門學者的唯一事業。語言家就常說為切要。可是我們現在要知一個字在某種方言中的讀法，多數還是要去找外國人編著的方言字彙，連本國人編著的上海話字彙也沒有，這似不能不怪語言學家的徒務高遠或不務正業了。</p>
<p>最近所常被觸到的，口頭語，手頭字，別字，注音銅模，平民字彙等等問題，都是與語言學極有關係的，而語言學家出來談這些問題的，似乎極少，在獨立評論上看到王了一關於別字問題的『文字的保守』，真覺得很可欣幸了。或者　位語言學教授的這一點小小的意見，其效力並不比他所譯的許多法國文學名著為少呢。文學家的周作人在說他比較費過長時期的學業，還是學過六年的海軍，所以預備『棄文就武』，雖然這仍是幽默，真相信不免是四方木頭，但個人終不免因此而對語言學家起他們能棄文就語言的希望。</p>
<h3 id="c205">老殘遊記二集 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 寒峰</p>
<p>「老殘遊記二集」，雖僅殘存六回，就其內容說，已是整然的一篇「逸雲傳」。對於這一個大澈大悟的泰山斗姥宮的師姑，劉大鈞先生認為是一十年來始終活在他的心上，林語堂先生作序，也認為「斗姥宮果有此人，吾非上泰山不可。」在劉鐵雲的筆下，逸雲實不愧為一個絕頂的異人，看透了色空的因果的。不過，當我一氣讀完了這部殘本的時候，所得到的印象，和兩先生却又自不同，感想是在逸雲這個人物以外。</p>
<p>聯繫「老殘遊記」正編二十回看去，劉鐵雲是很觀喜把自的理想，寄托在小說裏的異人身上。而這異人，又必須合乎他自已的理想純淨的，疏放的，超塵絕俗的，對人間社會有絕大領悟的。這樣的人物，當然不能求之於人間，為着適應於他的羅曼諦克的理想，他便不得不逞其才情，從事於創造。由於各個條件在舊時代人物理想上的適合性，和作者自已心理上的原因，這個創造的理想人物，在性別上，必然是落在女的一而。所以在正集裏，他創造了一個璵姑，在二集裏使不能不再來一個逸雲。</p>
<p>劉鐵雲這人不僅疏放，也很羅曼諦克，因此，無論在什麼時間，他都是把「真實的自已，」和「理想的自已」並存的。遊記前集有了老殘，就再有了一個璵姑；二集寫了老殘，還再來一個逸雲。老殘是代表了人間性較強的人，璵姑逸雲却是他的超現實的理想，一種空想的人生觀與世界觀的創造。讀「老殘遊記」，不在這一點上着眼，是很難犯得深人的對於作者的了解的。也只有了解得這一點，纔會惴得有科學頭腦的劉鐵雲，為什麼在寫實性很強的「老殘遊記」中，加上這樣兩個架空的人物。</p>
<p>璵姑逸雲雖同為劉鐵雲理想的寄托，在實質上，逸雲是更發展的，寫逸雲所耗費的力量所以然比寫璵姑用得大，也就是因為這是他更理想，更崇高的影子，是他晚年的人生觀和宇宙創造的凝集。在璵姑的談話裏反映出的三教互參的道理，到了他的晚年，寫二集的時候，他完全的把重心落在佛家了。</p>
<p>大概因為終於是一個理想，而不能和人間切斷吧，對於存在的人世，便依舊不能不有許多的牢騷與不滿。從逸雲的談話裏，能以看到當時的官吏是如何的橫行，也可以了解得人間世是如何的醜惡。並沒有決然的和人世分開，讀者感到與這個人物皮肉相關，這人物創造得不失敗在此，作者的成功也就在此。至於逸雲跳出情綱過程的自述，這完全是拿串鈴的老殘的菩薩心腸，偕此以超度人世，告訴讀者應該如何的超凡入聖。　老殘所以毫不留戀的送翠環入菴也。晚年的劉鐵雲，在遭受種種挫折之餘，雖說熱腸仍在，但他是免不了有倦怠之感了。</p>
<p>要了解劉鐵雲晚年的思想，以及讀過正集的，這部「老殘遊記」二集是應該一讀的。但如劉大鈞先後所說，其文筆有比正集更優秀的地方，則我不敢贊同。二集寫逸雲心理，在劉鐵雲的創作上，誠然是一個新境，但正集的許多優秀的地方，如大明湖，王小玉，黃河打水諸叚，是並不讓於解剖逸雲心理的成功。說是在描寫上有新的展，我是空全同章，再則，正集的所以獲得成功，主要的是在社會生活寫實，和他的一種較科學的方法上，雖有理想的璵姑，重心並不在這一方面，讀者能以得到的印象，是有真實感的。二集印相反，因為僅僅寫了逸雲一叚，現實的成分是較輕，讀時雖也感到可喜，終覺是在讀一部「理想小說。」全書方是一個開始，當然不能據此以作定論，不過，比正集給序更高的佔價，從任何方面，是都沒有必要的。</p>
<h3 id="c206">阿沙漢河上 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 斐兒</p>
<p>曾經是華，巫的爭執地的阿沙漢，是統轄着我們這班東方人——東方人，除了日本之外，是意味着有被統治者的意義的。——的府尹駐在地。二年來屢想到那兒一行，總因事做不到，這回終算成行了。</p>
<p>早上，當新加拉惹輪由大海轉入阿沙漢河的時候，阿沙漢河的流水便浩蕩地迎接着我們，而中國漁人的工績又在我們眼前顯現了。</p>
<p>在阿沙漢河口，從深人海中的第一柵中國漁人所設的捉魚的櫥柱算起，輪船在幾點鐘間總從漁人的柱椿間穿過。中國人用着被烈日晒得焦黑的堅強而耐勞的體魄，在阿沙漢河上揚起帆檣，佈下網置。從輪船上望出去，滿眼看得見河上捉魚的人們，載着捕獲物，用着健康的歡笑向着熱帶的驕陽抗戰。因為自已是在K地會和這班漁夫們攪熱的，對於他們的生活形態，頗能知道多少；所以一看見他們在工作和收穫後所享受的歡樂，便深深地在自已的心上也浮起了歡笑。</p>
<p>一祝福捉魚蝦的人們，太平詳和印度洋的海上是你們的；廣大的南洋羣島的海上也是你們的。一在　上，是這麼喃喃着。</p>
<p>看着漁夫們裸着　黑的身軀，用着矯健的臂膊，從海上和河中拉起網繩，或甚至深入水中和兇惡的　魚搏鬥，却又從容地從水里浮上來，帶着勝利的微笑，那時的歡樂我是有份的。或當潮水漲溢，波浪不時在小小的漁舟上衝擊，而我們的漁人們却勇敢地繼績着工作，讓一葉的扁舟在波中浮沈，一陣讀美和羨慕的心情又從我的心中抖起：</p>
<p>「我，算和什麼東西呢？看看大地的兒子，這班海上的霸王呀！」想着這去崎嶇的生活路程，心里異常羞愧着。</p>
<p>因為水流的關係，船常常傍着岸走。有時靠着左邊，有時却靠着右邊。在船行的更遲鈍的速率中，在近岸咫尺的地方，河水受着輪船的沖擊，時時把浪花衝向岸灘上去，發出嘩啦嘩啦的音響。靠近河岸的椰叢，因為岸灘的崩墮，不時有一兩棵椰樹斜倒河中，把樹梢傾斜地屹立在水里。在岸上，時時看見猴子們在野藤，椰林，或阿答叢間嬉戲。輪船一靠近，旅客便向牠們發出「唏唏」之聲，而幼小的猴子便會實向牠們母新的懷裏去了。</p>
<p>在河水之泛成的一道白沫上，各種樹頭和木片趁着急流奔馳；在河兩馳如矢；或有戴着土耳其式的帽子，用着手搖的雙槳和蓋着阿答葉頂蓬的舟子，預備載客用的，那姿勢却是異常惰散。</p>
<p>河岸兩旁，時時發見用着阿答葉蓋着的屋子，疏落地在椰叢間半顯半露。一把梯子從岸上掛入河中；馬來婦人抱着小孩子站在梯子的預端向着輪船睜視。</p>
<p>船一達到阿沙漢的港口峇眼，旅客的心便非常歡躍了。峇眼是一個漁人們所集合着的埠市，牠所顯現出來的是萬綠叢中的一派赤色，用着雜亂的阿答屋子的屋角向着旅人。船一臨近的時候，傍岸的街道是明晰地可簽名簿。漁人三三兩兩地在傍岸的街頭上行走，或停下足來向輪船的身上盼望。</p>
<p>船在河中一停，中國苦力們便把載着漁產的木船搖近前來。在成堆的貨包上，一陣鹹魚蝦的臭味便刺入旅客的鼻孔。機器聲便突然喧鬧，起重機把一包包的貨物都給裝入船艙。以後，荷蘭船長在頂樓上皺着眉頭，而漁夫們却在苦笑中把輪船送走了。</p>
<p>「近來魚價猛跌，以致K.P.M.公司也把運費減低了」。船開的時候同行的林君告訴我。</p>
<p>我了然於船長和漁夫們表情的一幕。在K地，我認識的漁友們會告訴我的。如果環境和篇較長的文章裏把這些事件都記錄下來吧！</p>
<p>船開行之後，頂樓上的荷蘭船長便拔起獵槍來，向河中射擊　魚取樂。聽着槍聲一響，便瞥見河裏的一只　魚，被槍所傷，把尾巴翹起來，身體向河心一翻，把河水激成了一陣浪花，便沈向河裏去了。</p>
<p>槍擊一響又一響，河水便在一陳浪花之後又繼以另一陣浪花：而一只只的　魚便在翹首出水呼吸之後，都靜悄悄地沈下水裏看不見蹤影了。為了這種情形的好玩和有趣，引得全船旅客的注視，而頂樓上的白種人也激起了一陣陣的笑聲。我，一想到中國漁人們的當前的厄運，却不知怎的，對於船長皺眉後的這種玩樂，感到了一陣憎惡。</p>

<p>漢子將那快要吸到嘴邊的烟枝，乘勢向路邊林木封着的山壕裏吐去，立起身來抓着足下的那根木棍，順手向不遠的山坡指一指，笑着說道：</p>
<p>「看哪，那就是我做的生意呵！」</p>
<p>見他提起棍子就嚇着了的三個人，都連忙向山坡望去，矮小的綠樹叢中，泛濫着白波也似的潮水，—那金是些爬動著的羊子呀。</p>
<p>老陳道才鬆了一口氣，但還急促地說着話，大概由於忽然高興起來的原故吧。</p>
<p>「哪，這，這是好職業呀！」</p>
<p>秦老板舒服地嘆了一聲，大大放心了，隨即撲着發燒起來的臉子，心裏便怪着自已剛才不該說出那麼可憐，那麼丟臉的話。</p>
<p>老徐喜得亂抓着腦袋連連贊美道：</p>
<p>「羊子真肥呵，真肥呵！」</p>
<p>牧羊人一面走上山坡的小路，一面唱了起來：</p>

<p>跟着坡上面有人接唱下去：</p>
<p>「天不怕，</p>

<p>— （美國LT法來耳作）宜閑譯</p>
<p>競審者一個又一個的棄權了，競賽的範圍狹小下駢，可是一個月過去了，時日還拖延着。一天，跳舞場上有人做著生日。又一天，兩個新結識的競賽者，就在場上訂着婚，這事情接二連三地引出各種粗野的笑話來，有的甚至說到他們日後結婚的初夜的光景了，後來這訂婚的一對受着情慾的衝動，一時情不自禁起來：女郎們不由得驚叫了一陣，那個女的這才拖出場子去。他們兩人喪失了資格，退出「馬拉松」，別的新鮮趣事又出來了。又一天一個女郎就在場子上拔脫了一夥蛀齒，不一會又昏昏沉沉的轉着跳舞了。又一天，因為兩夫妻失業的緣故，同妻參加着跳舞的一個意大利少年弄踐了腿，而且發高熱了。雖是兩眼熱得紅腫，憔悴的臉孔上印着痛苦的皺紋，他却還一拐一拐的跳舞着。過了十二小時期間，因為病勢加劇的緣故，公正人就強制他退出競賽了。</p>
<p>幾次三番，太克司舉着有一些竟外的進欵到了手，也可以滿意，想要離場了，可是他總是硬着頭皮幹下去。他同別的競賽者一樣，常常迷迷朦朦的睡過去，於是得用體外的方法來催醒他，使他繼績着跳舞。男看護就用熱乎巾拍他的臉，把他的鞋子左右掉錯了給他穿，用電振器在他身上摩一陣，用指頭在他喉嚨里挖一下，把他脚底的雞眼剔一回。有一個時期，他的咳嗆厲害起來，變成了胸痛。又有一個時期，他神昏顛倒的足足過了三星期。他的舞侶瑪利也捱受着同樣的慘苦。他們還是跳舞着。一天一天，一夜一夜的過去，場上的競賽者減到十三對，十對，八對，五對，最後只剩下兩對。於是瑪利暈倒了，她被送到醫院去，大克司就此失掉資格了。他們每人領到了第二位的獎金，兩百五十元。</p>
<p>睡錢的法門逐日產生出來，他盡力利用着，這才所有的競賽者都有錢多了。個個人練熟了刀，戲法或是技藝，一首歌，一種跳舞，一種什麼特技，待到引起了大家的注意，羣衆就向他們撒錢了。有一個競賽者是粗魯的鄉下少年，原是立陶宛人，口音上帶些鼻音，他嚷着剃樣片作為他特技。大克司呢，學會了一種跳舞。商店，戲院和致電也向他出些費給他們，叫他們佩帶什麼標記，或是穿上前後兩面印着廣告的汗衫內衣。他們接了錢，還收了愛慕看的信件，往往寫得文即欠通，同太克司平時寫的那樣寫不多。各種久樣的看客各自挑選着場中的跳舞者，吶喊着鼓勵他們。</p>

<p>— 龐京周</p>
<p>向社會人士解説　向醫界同人介紹</p>
<p>然而衛生署此次發售蛋黃素，却有下列的失着相形成的流弊：</p>
<p>（甲）並未先將該藥樣品及馬君之文獻預先介紹與醫界，以致醫家對於此項新生牌蛋黃素有些懷疑，有些冷淡，不作肯定的評判而又一部份醫師，則因爲不知道所然，而隨便放棄。</p>
<p>（乙）衛署製品旣用時髦牌號，而說明書中的口氣，又十二分商業化，沒有對醫家的口氣，只是吸戶的口氣，以致一部分混人疑心衛署發賣此藥、是發財生涯，有包辦全國戒烟藥的企圖，於是引起投機藥商的影戤和濫造，殊爲發明人馬君始料所不及。</p>
<p>（丙）說明書第四項，確曾勸服用蛋黃素者「最好經醫師指導，或入院爲宜」，但是吸戶的心理，就是要不入院，不受醫師指導，所以來買蛋黃素吃，於是所出售的蛋黃素，只是供瞎吃，只是供試吃，而結果皆不良好。</p>
<p>（丁）說明書第三項「戒烟人自服用此藥後，自然而自能逐日减少烟量，並生憎惡」一語，最聳聽聞，恰合我們國民的單方迷口味，要知道一般吸尸理想中間，不是不願戒烟，是疑懼戒烟不知有多大痛苦，每日在希望一種如靈斯響單方來拯救他的痼患，今覩蛋黃素，以爲是仙丹來了，然而這種缺少自制力的吸尸，當能在家服用，而自减其吸量，（家居者與醫院中的烟犯生活思想完全不同毋待贅言），於是由希望太股而失望，由失望而胡亂批評，說得蛋黃素一文不値，這種悠悠之口，滿佈了社會，再請醫家來證明學理，反覺得太遲了，中國事往往如此。</p>
<p>（戊）衛署以爲吸烟人的程度很高，在發賣時附有紀錄表，令服者自塡，然而結果塡者甚少，卽塡亦不全，全亦不寄向衛署，以致仍舊得不到多數統計，連嫌惡衛生署製品的口味不佳，也引爲研究不完全，而加以批評，於是投機藥商，就說有美味的蛋黃素要上市了，這種情形，還談什麼藥理呢？</p>
<p>（己）衛署在發賣此藥之前，沒有充分準備，不採取登記的方法，以致製品供不應求，大半被試吃和瞎吃的人所消耗，而眞有恒心的用戶，倒反向隅，說明書中第六項，力勸用戶「服用此藥不可間斷」，而結果衛署以貨乏斷人之服用，似乎也小小失信於用戶，不明白人，就以此責備藥的本身，未免寃枉了、</p>
<p>（六）蛋黃素是否戒煙無上妙品？</p>
<p>這個問題。恐怕是諸君所急待知的。然而要答解這問題。須要能確定蛋黃素的功效。方可和他藥作比較。著者雖用過許多蛋黃素。却未能用盡其他方法。卽使査各國的記錄。也可能就下斷語。因爲在這答案裏面。還須一個確定「戒烟」兩字意的大前提。——所謂烟毒的廣義。是包涵嗎啡鈔，紅丸，白麵，土皮，龍頭水，一切類似鴉片的毒癮在內。狹義則可說僅指一榻橫陳大士，雲土，波斯士，熱河土等膏子的槍吸而已。以前中國人大都用槍吸。如今國民經濟一天天崩潰。於是劇毒解癮法日多。然而和外國比較。槍吸還是我們多。他們很少。外國毒禁森嚴。凡有癮的就是罪犯。發見就要勒戒。癮君子旣都是犯人。而犯人又都是住院病人。住院病人又係呑服與打嗎啡針者居多。自然他們所研究的戒烟法。偏向於住院治療的方式。而且爲了時間與經濟。更偏向於速戒一途。我國却不然。從前烟禁廢弛時代。士大夫用以療病。美其名呌福壽膏。應酬間備以敬客。把牠當作紹興酒。更有好閒之徒。一生寄託在此。竟當牠古董般賞玩。「斗熟槍靈燈出罩。烟香茶熟枕頭高。」十四字。最足以形容哭嗷烟霞的情趣。所以這一班槍吸者。精神上的癖好。比肉體上的習慣。細胞裏可以推尋的變化。還要深（按鴉片作用。對於精神上發生Euphoril。譯意是輕快的一種感覺。這於馬君所見的高基氏器。或者不相干了。）因此我國除斟酌採用世界許多成法之外。似乎應有爲槍吸者設想的必要，馬君文昭此番試用蛋黃素。覺得此物。或較其他方法爲近情。他實抱有莫大宏願。但他並沒有自以爲凌駕一切方法之上尤其是他在醫院內所得的成績。對於幾位最舒服的吸戶。是不負什麼使命的。本文作者現在開業界。故與此種吸戶接近較多。所見所聞。或與馬君不同。因把使用蛋黃素的經騐。摘要如下。（一）蛋黃素並無絕大之流弊。僅不耐其味者作小嘔。服後腹瀉的數人中。半曾患痢。停服後瀉止。（二）服蛋黃素者體重皆增。增量不等。（三）有一旦捨去烟槍而僅代以蛋黃素者。無涕淚交流之犯癮症象。然精神頹靡。（四）吸者於服用蛋黃素而自動减少吸烟時。前一二星期减甚速。入後漸難。因而中輟者甚多。當卽另經醫師手爲之調度。（五）久服蛋黃素而再服鴉片類代用品者。忍受量大都並不减少。（六）凡服蛋黃素而已减至每日吸二三口者。若無自動决心（堅决意志。）及他動决心（有被勒戒之理由者）。仍舊不能斷癮。普通家庭間人。祇有勸吸烟者勿硬戒。殆無人可代表醫師爲其限制吸量。（七）按馬君在醫院雖給病人以槍吸。然此　　等已在監護之下的槍吸。非癮君子最滿意之事。又則馬君原理。係服蛋黃素後不需要鴉片。」並非「服蛋黃素後不能再受鴉片。」所以衛生署說明書中「並生憎惡」一語。微嫌過火。而許多吸者。覺得减到兩三筒時。非但不生憎惡。而且愛好逾恒。於是對於蛋黃素不信任。（八）如用代用品戒烟。而同時服蛋黃素。則見效易且速、此近馬君初次試騐之法。</p>
<p>旣然毒物節圍甚廣。况方法不限槍吸。息者環境又各異。所以矯　的方法。不可拘泥。已往學者研究恭詳。作者嘗見一九二八年美國「藥物癮研究委員會與公共衛生局共同出版的「鴉片問題」一書。The　Opium　Problem　1928（The　Committeeon　Drug　Addictions　inCollaboration　with　the　Bureau　of　Social　Hygiene）。網羅各國文獻甚富。對於鴉片作用在精神上細胞上肉體上發生的影響。搜討至盡。馬君高基氏器之說僅類此書一端耳。此書附載的各國療法。</p>

<p>有數十種之多。而日本的Antimorchin。與近時流行的泡漿法。還不在內。此外據我所知道。德國盛行的Pernukton睡眠法。因蘇林戒烟法。各種不需代用品的處方多得很。（按矯正神經系受毒習慣。離不了一個時間問題。所以採用催眠法。使被戒者的痛苦時間在睡眠狀態之中過去。餘則强壯劑採用亦多。故用Strychnin的處方常見。卽市上常用的賜保命諸藥。也無非是輔助精神而已。並沒有麻醉品在內。因許多人誤會。故附錄於此。）吾有人爲戒烟者限制吸量。則中國舊時林文忠方。和鹽炒米粉加生烟等方。何嘗無效。若論心理療法。則濟公壇的仙水。又安知無少數人戒除。不過市上開業醫。爲遷就一般舒服的吸戶起見。總逃不出代用品的窠臼。自從前三年。法國用以戒酒的泡漿注射法（卽現稱自身血淸注射法。）推行到上海。而某將軍又用此法戒烟出洋。於是風靡一時。等到蛋黄素上市。好像鼎足而三。海上登廣吿的戒烟醫院。廣吿中常稱「些三法本院俱皆優爲」云云。眞是看得科學世界太小了。（按讓此文。可參考許多書本。幸勿借吾之說。再作廣吿材料。）</p>
<p>總而言之。戒烟方法繁多。或取正攻。或取側擊。或重精神。或重肉體。各有理由。各具價値。患者程度不同。收效運速不一。本篇限於淺說。不能一一贅述。姑且舉幾種與馬君方法有關的文獻在下面。（一）一九二二年德國F．A．Looks。就提過嗎啡與蛋黄素的化合關係。（二）一九二五年德國Ph．Klee與O．Grossman。應用Cholin。就是含有蛋黄素的物質。（二）一九二六年AlexanderLambert　and　Frederick　Tilney。用一種成藥。呌作Narcosan戒烟。裏面所含的東西。三分之一是黄豆裏面和棉花子裏面的類脂肪質。簡直就像目今衛署的製品咧。（四）去年法國雜誌Bulletine　de　medicine　1934　B　XT．。載有Procedede　Deintoxication　rapide　des　morphinomanes　par　les　lmulsiones　de　lipoides一文。述用類脂防體乳糜。和其他油類注射於肌肉內。每天須注射五次。每次五公分。有五七日速戒嗎啡癮之效。他的理論。有用類脂肪體去解除神經系的宿癮之意。頗與Loofs的理論相類。但這種使用法。又祇宜於住院病人罷了。</p>
<p>（七）結論</p>
<p>陸續寫來。巳覺費辭。簡括數語。吿一結束罷。</p>
<p>（一）毒霧瀰漫的中國。確需要一種仙丹般靈藥來戒烟。尤其要一種吸戶用的舒適的方子。</p>
<p>（二）蛋黃素是許多戒烟法中的一法。比較別種方法似乎很方便有人限制吸量可不一定住院。最好與他法輔行。却並沒有仙丹般靈效。</p>
<p>（三）爲全國計。若多設戒烟所。則外國許多成法。都可採用。</p>
<p>（四）凡藥物效否全視使用得當與否使用不得法。不能歸咎於藥。</p>
<p>（五）良藥苦口利於病。卽使藥好。也要服者略忍。倘吸者一些不肯放棄烟的舒服。母寗仍吸鴉片。因爲仔細說起來。連鴉片與嗎啡的功用。還不同呢。</p>
<p>（六）增加全國癮君子的决心。戒烟方法的效率便會增高。惟有法令森嚴。</p>
<p>（七）一部份開業界。對此次蛋黄素的問世。不甚加以硏究。似乎太冷。衛生署發行蛋黃素徵求統計。不從各醫師各醫院做起。而直接售與吸戶。似乎太早。藥商在尙未有許多統計以前。先要緊做投機生意。未免更早。而僅拿蛋黄素三字來做戒烟專科廣吿的。則未免太糟了。（完）</p>

<p>（五十六）僂佝病（Rachitis）（下）</p>
<p>（問）患了枸僂病之後，關節起什麽病狀？</p>
<p>（答）關節有異常强度的伸展位置。</p>
<p>（問）佝僂病，在年長的人，有發生的嗎？</p>
<p>（答）在十歲到十八歲的兒童，也有發生和幼兒的枸僂病同樣的病狀的；這特稱爲晚發性或少年枸僂病。</p>
<p>（問）晚發性佝僂病的發生原因，是怎樣的？</p>
<p>（答）大槪是早發性枸僂病的再發，所以發生原因也和早發性的相同。但也有突然發生這病的。</p>
<p>（問）晚發性佝僂病的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）這種病初起時·病人在起立或步行時訴苦痛，訴苦痛，容易疲勞，全身有强度的發汗，又往往起痙搐症狀。</p>
<p>（問）後來怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）後來起脊柱彎曲，上肢和下肢彎曲，胸廓也現彎曲。又頭蓋起特有的變化，就是上鴿突出，頭骨變形，病人面色蒼白，肌肉弛緩，並且發育遲緩，四肢逐漸短縮，成爲侏儒。</p>
<p>（問）思了拘僂病之後，經過有多少時間？</p>
<p>（答）經過數月到數年，客易再發。</p>
<p>（問）重症的枸僂病，合併什麽危險徵象？</p>
<p>（答）常合併痙孿質，有時容易起　門痙攣，就很危險。</p>
<p>（問）成僂病的預後，吉凶怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）這種病，若能經過適當的治療，大多數可以治愈。可是胸廓的變形和四肢的彎曲，是永久留存着的。病重的，發育被阻止，成爲侏　的很多。</p>
<p>（問）診斷上吻該和那幾種病相鑑別？</p>
<p>（答）應該　遺傳梅毒，梅勒巴洛氏病及小兒性黏液水腫等相鑑別。</p>
<p>（問）治療佝僂病的方法怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）有營養療法放射療法和生活素療法三種。</p>
<p>（問）營養療法怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）在幼兒，應當哺與母乳，小兒到六個月後，乳汁中再加些蔬菜汁，肉湯，水果汁等。</p>
<p>（問）放射療法怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）因爲太陽光中的紫外線，對於佝僂病，有特殊的效力；所以病人應當每日用人工太陽燈照射，治愈非常迅速。又病人吃的東西，像牛乳雞蛋等也用人工太陽燈照射後纔吃。</p>
<p>（問）生活素療法，怎樣</p>
<p>（答）是利用增補丁種生活素的方法。魚肝油中含丁種生活素很多，可以常服。此外有純粹的製劑像Vanigtol　Calciferrol　Vitamin—D等再加鈣劑一同服用，非常有效。完</p>

<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（四十五）鼻閉塞</p>
<p>鼻閉塞一症。是鼻科疾病當中的一個主要症候。這個症候是人人都可遇著的。因爲發生鼻閉塞的機會。太多的緣故。凡是可使鼻腔粘膜發生腫脹及肥厚的各種鼻炎，鼻腔的腫瘍，鼻中隔的畸形，以及鼻腔的異物等等。均足發生鼻閉塞。我們營呼吸運動的時候。本以鼻腔爲主。如果有了鼻閉塞。那就鼻腔陷於閉塞不通。呼吸氣量。亦感不足。勢必開放口腔。補足呼吸。此時稱爲口腔呼吸。在高度鼻閉塞的時候。並可將鼻腔呼吸完全廢棄。同時對於患者的周圍器官及身體發育上。亦因此而蒙極大的影響。茲將由影響而發生的病情。略述如左。</p>
<p>一、對於周圍器官上所發生的病情最易受著影響發生病變的。就是呼吸器及聽器的兩部。在呼吸器方面。常易發生咽頭炎，喉頭炎，及氣管炎。這是因爲由口腔呼吸所吸入的空氣。大都乾燥的緣故。並不像由鼻腔呼吸所吸入的空氣。能够得著鼻腔粘膜產生的濕潤。使他變爲濕潤的空氣。不致發生呼吸器官的炎症。在聽器方面，則因口腔呼吸的關係。常致歐氏管的換氣不充分。或竟完全杜絕。這個時侯最易發生中耳疾病。並繼常發耳聾。此外尙須注意的。就是鼻閉塞患者。在營鼻腔呼吸的時候。一般常有狹窄性的雜音。在睡眠的時候。常發鼾聲。有時往往引起頭痛，鼻性注意不能症，記憶力减退，睡眠不足等等各種神經症狀。</p>
<p>二、對於身體發育上所發生的病情人在少年期的時候。正是身體各部發育的時期。如果在這個時期患著了鼻閉塞。那就易起各種發育的障碍。在少年期中。最易引起身體發育障碍的一種鼻閉塞。最顯著的就是由患腺樣增殖症而來的一種鼻閉塞。關於腺樣增殖症的病情相發生鼻閉塞的原因。待我下次續談。</p>

<p>心痠痛Angina　Pectoris</p>
<p>心疲痛是一種劇烈的痛，發現在心部並反射痛到左肩左臂同時病狀危急大有死亡臨身之勢。這種毛病的原因大槪是心的血管硬化，心肌衰壞，或心大動脈管根有毛病，梅毒、痛風，慢性腎炎，吸烟過度等等。心　痛發作常由於用肌力如登高，逆風行走，或心腦受激刺，或腸胃消化不良等引起。</p>
<p>心痠痛常如靑天霹靂忽然臨身，心痛如刀刺，同時又反射痛到左肩左臂左手。每次疼痛發作歷數秒鐘，數分鐘，成數小時不等，有時數日之內連發多次，也有時數星期或數月之中發作一次。痛後病者於數小時或數日內戚覺到精疲力竭。心　痛發作的時間越長精神損失的也越多。</p>
<p>人有了這種病他的生命存亡是不一定的。有時頭一次發作就會死亡，有時第二第三次發作死亡，或不知那一次發作死亡。也有的時發時比經好幾年仍存活。總而言之痛發作的回數越多歷時越久死亡也越容易。</p>
<p>止心　痛的方法可分爲治標與治本兩種。治標的目的爲臨時止痛不必問是什麼原因。輕的與短時間痛吸亞硝酸澱粉痛就可以止住。假設止不住注射止痛藥劑或吸哥羅芳須由醫師指導。治本的辦法爲：（一）預防。病人於痛不發時注意安靜的生活。身體不要出力，腦筋也不要受激刺。務戒除烟酒。勿飮濃茶，因茶內的咖啡素是屬於激刺性的。（二）治療。如病人多年前曾有過梅毒的務認眞治療梅毒。由老梅毒生的心痠痛如治療得當全愈還有希望。其餘任何種的心　痛治療全愈都很少有把握。治療除臨時救急外照普通治療心病法行可也。</p>
<p>風濕痛Rheumatism</p>
<p>風濕痛是一種病患者起始發熟同時好幾個骨節也痛，或心臟也發炎。病的原因多是由於扁桃腺慢性發炎，齒槽生膿，鼻腔膿炎等。這種的骨節痛是好發個骨節一齊發炎一齊痛。最平常發現在大骨節，如膝節，脚踝節，兩肩節，肘節等。其餘身上任何骨節也可以發生同樣毛病。也常是這個骨節剛剛好了別的骨節又痛起來了。就是一個骨節也有時發時好。骨節痛時日夜難忍，夜間更甚。病人靜臥時疼痛較輕，稍有移動就痛的不得了。以上是風濕痛病理病狀的槪要。（未完）</p>

<p>— 宸</p>
<p>北平劉景桂槍殺自己的情敵，運動大家逯明的愛人，復自首投案，這已經是轟動遐邇的事，老少皆知，無須贅述。這兒我們要談這一桃色案件審訊的情形。</p>
<p>電傳當開審時，法院調大批警憲，武裝戒備，有似當年訊詰太保阿書的嚴重；而法院門前，觀衆于餘，則又爲陶思瑾情殺案以來第一次。最使我們注目的，是新聞記者對於這同爲被吿的劉景桂與　明，在身爲「階下囚」時的情景。據謂劉景桂「面呈笑容」，逯明「愁苦垂頭」，可見一者是求仁得仁，視死如歸，一則自咎自靑，狼狽已極。後劉供述與　明在北平天壽公寓北京旅館及張垣等處發生肉體關係，謂逯云「我一切已屬你，你一切已屬我，同宿何妨」，無異讀牡丹亭的旖旎文章，供至　提解除婚約時，淚如雨下，又不啻讀元積的鶯鶯詩，暗然傳神。</p>
<p>這許多的現實文章，在近年來我們已經讀得不少。在一般殉情主義的詩人，大槪總可吟咏好些可歌可泣的詩，然而我們實在「麻木傷仁」，只能冷靜的寄上一首哀　的葬曲。是的，我們承認近年來許多靑年男女負上「愛神的箭」的創傷而殀亡，其間大有客觀的原因在，然而許多靑年男女忘避現實的躱入「愛」的小天地，糾纏得來成爲人生的唯一眞義，不能不說這是自尋苦惱，作繭自縛了。</p>
<p>有了戀愛至上主義，自然才有近年來無數殉愛自殺與情殺的事件發生。這種現象發現於承平之時，已經表現一種社會意識不健全的變態，然而却盛行於中國這所謂「國難當前」「民族危機」的現代，未免就十分的不調和。在現在，男女間的「愛」眞的如像流行的「戀愛經」所謂，愛是生命，愛是人生，愛是主宰一切的上帝那樣麽？實在只有使人浩歎！</p>
<p>劉景桂殺死情敵後毫不畏罪的自首，可見其「决門」之勇，在被審訊時復「面呈笑容」亦表示她「殉情」的「慷慨就義」，在供述途明薄情解約時復「淚如雨下」，也可說明她對　明「愛之深而恨之切」，這一種「愛」的精神，固可投合一般少爺小姐的味口，大駡　明幾聲「負義」，然而此風一長，罪惡不在他們無以對社會，而在影饗一般人逃避現實的「爲情而死」的一種麻醉。</p>

<p>— 二郞</p>
<p>住在山谷裏的彭家莊的人，對於外面的世界他們是不明瞭的。兩三百年以來，週圍幾十里的村莊才出了彭國柱一個秀才，那時已經了不起，現在聽說民國雖然沒有秀才，大學生却比秀才的官大幾十倍，秀才爺的兒子是一個在京城的大學生，那是多麽的榮耀有光采？當秀才爺的兒子彭耀先考上了京城裏的大學那時候，全彭家莊就好像瘋了一樣，整整地放了一天的鞭炮，祠堂裏還大開龕門，由秀才爺率領合族老幼向祖先神主行禮祭祀，接着就接受了鄰人們送雞蛋的賀禮、恭喜了一天。這回，大學生要回鄉省親了。說是放什麽暑假，就好比戲文裏的狀元回鄉省親一樣。好幾天以前，秀才爺放出了這一個消息，大家已經議論紛紛，高興萬分，心頭卜卜地跳着在等熱鬧了。今天一淸早，就有人跑到山頭上去望望官道，可是眞是急煞人的事，過了午，官道上還不見什麽影響。大家都相信看，大學生回鄉省親何等隆重的事，一定是鼓鑼喝道、遠遠地就可以看見他的官轎合聽到　聲了。可是，官道上什麽官轎亦沒有，什麽鑼聲亦聽不見。漸漸地使人疲倦了，有的還是下田去，</p>
<p>黃昏時分，山頭上有人很快很快地搶　　下莊口來，那是彭家的長工阿大。阿大跑下山頭，一定是大學生回來了，於是乎大家搶到祠堂裏等着向秀才爺恭喜，有的將賀禮雞蛋已經帶在身邊，不一回，眞的聽到山頭上的鑼聲，接着就遠遠地望見山頭上有一部藍呢官轎，前頭一把白布大旗，接着白布大旗之後還有一隊荷槍的老總。—「來了，來了，」「大學生比狀元還要威風，有老總在轎前喝道啦！」彭家莊的人們笑着呌起來。</p>
<p>原來這都是秀才爺出的主張，在昨天，就呌人到城裏等他兒子，吩咐他向縣長要派隊保護，說是路上土匪出沒無常，幷且呌他製就一面大旗寫明「北京大學生彭耀先」八個大字，敲鑼的却是從城裏僱來的人。—大學生回鄉省親，多麽威風？剛進村口，鞭炮放起來了，鑼聲一直響到祠堂裏、官轎在祠堂門口停下，大學生頭戴草帽，身穿洋服，脚登皮鞋，這更了不起。可是，當向祖先神主行禮祭祀的時候，大家都跪下去，大學生却站着在鞠躬，反了反了，祭祀祖先不跪下，成什麽體統？秀才爺氣得臉紅紅，族人們都在暗地裏議論了。、</p>
<p>然而，事後秀才爺對人說這：「如今民國時代，不興跪拜了，大學生在京城裏見大總統的時候，亦是行鞠躬就算了呢。」這才使大學生從族人們那　拉回尊敬之心。</p>

<p>不管人世間是籠罩着多沉重的飢餓與苦難的影子；但在這兒，在作爲季節之風雨表的自然界，嘆息與瘋狂是沒有的——有的就祇是一種不可推翻，不可動搖的循着自然界底意志的（正像人類遵循着歷史的規律一樣的）同一的步調：他們行動着，他們忍受着，他們用求生的姿態來度過這沸騰如炎炙的長夏，他們用勞苦來走進一個更安定的收穫的季節。</p>
<p>而現在是：溫暖和平的氣候已經跟着春天走去，漸漸地，終於成了歷史上的黑影子：炎夏是不適宜於淺徊幽思的，它是充滿着可怕的不可抑止的滋長的力的啊。</p>
<p>四月尾的調子漸漸地從舒適中掙脫過來了；鬧街上舖上了一片頑固的火一般的在人底心頭薰炙着的太陽：在這中間，人們忽略了商店裏的夏季大减價的旗幟的繽紛，忽略了另外一部的優閑的女人底單薄的衣衫，祗是忽忙地在大街的兩邊奔跑着：各人帶着一顆燥急的心，帶着一個流汙的身體，行走着像累了的牛。</p>
<p>商人們是惴惴地開始作起半祈禱式的希望來了：四月尾在這不景氧的年頭是一個値得祖憂的關頭：但也許總有方法過去的吧？是的，一定有辦法過去的，要是到了五月——</p>
<p>（到了五月，街上與小巷裏有了喊賣梅子的聲音；街上與小巷裏也有了許多異樣的心情。大路止常常有大而黑的，像暗影那麽頑固的警備車出現了。）</p>
<p>風漸漸地　起來，五月是一個更適宣宜於遊息的季候了，人（一部份的人）離去了都會中的緊張與紛雜，而詩人般地帶着閑雅的心情到野外去了，換上了輕薄薄的郊遊服，帶着汽車，手杖，可愛的太太，望遠鏡，照相機……</p>
<p>於是，對着都會，對着躺在它裏面的街道與小巷：「五月是不適宜於都會的啊；但願這是一次愉快的短期旅行，也但願這一個五月是平靜的吧！」</p>
<p>如果說四月是散文的，則五月將一定是演義的了。</p>

<p>— 樺枷</p>
<p>我們這一次步行是冒險的。三個伴侶當中是有兩個沒有走過這一條崎嶇的山路的，在我的記憶上，這也是一條陌生的路，不過在兩年前我曾從這裏走過。大槪在二十里內，我們是不會遇到任何村落的，但是在今天的夜裏我們便要趕到距離此地約三十里的某村去。</p>
<p>兩邊是很高峭的山壁咧，禿禿地沒有一點樹木，和一些較大一點的植物。相信這些地方是樵夫也不會到來的；不過在這一帶山鄉的地方，這樣的小道已經算是唯一的交通道路了。這個地方我們本來是不想來的；可且爲了那小學校的聘書，和那『職業」的光燄的引誘，我們這三個年靑人都忘記了痛苦了，因爲我們感覺到失業的威脅和生活的恐怖。於是我們只好走着這陌生的崎嶇的山路去踐一個朋友的邀酌，和職業的溫暖。</p>
<p>這一帶地方，本來是不大開通的，而且又沒有水道，所以每逢遇了什麽事時總得跑路。照例從省域趁了這些兩廣所特有的輪拖渡到了水流盡的地方時便上岸，上了岸便有一些公路汽車在接客，乘了車到了縣城之後，跑路去是已很近了，只有七八里左右。可是近來因爲下了幾天大雨，把那沒有堅固的公路弄得泥濘地通不得汽車了，於是大家都得跑路。他們本地人跑路是習慣了的，可憐我們外鄉人到了這裏來要跑這悠長的三十多里路，確不是玩兒的。</p>
<p>起來跑的還好，有村落，有田畦，有樹木茅房，可是到了沒尾了，只剩得兩邊峭壁夾着一條山路，而且據鄉人們說，這條山路會延長至二十里，到看見了種菸草的田畦時便很近了。我們便要在這一天下午跑完了這比三十里還長的山路。</p>
<p>在寂靜的恐怖的山路裏、我們只能憑藉了各人的勇氣，和在燒燃着的靑年人的心火，照亮了路，而大家都不畏懼一切地進行着，像一隊兵士去襲擊他們的敵人一樣。</p>
<p>有時我們也會埋怨起來，不該到這種山鄕來找　恐怖和煩惱。不過一時的勇氣文鼓動了我們，我們還年靑，這一點點原算不得什麽痛苦，因爲我們是爲去『找飯吃」啊！於是我們又更大路步地走我們的陌生的山路。</p>
<p>一股泉的菸味衝進我們的鼻孔來了。我們感覺到了一種非常的愉快。山路又完結了，靑綠的菸田在我們面前蕩漾了，我們更快樂地加速着這可怕的旅程，而去找尋那職業的溫暖。</p>

<h3 id="c220">龍游河畔 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 沅芷</p>
<p>夜色像一襲薄薄的輕綃，已籠罩在蜿蜒的龍游河上了。</p>
<p>龍游河，這是一個多麼雅緻，而富有特殊風格的名字啊。正如這名字一樣，這河流是雅緻的，兩岸疎疎朗朗地挺著些灌木，和一片綠色的蔓草，雜色的小野花。河身從遠遠的西方拖過來、彎彎曲曲，像一條長長的巨龍。凡是打從這河裏過往的船隻，那怕他是竹葉艇，也沒有方法使自己航得快一點；你心燥，是毫無用處的。非得慢慢地把舵漿撥左撥右穿過了河面，才會順着你自己的意思去處置。</p>
<p>何裏的水，十分澄淸，因爲河的口子通着湖，這樣的活流，自然不怕汚塞或是船雙把河底的黃泥翻濁水流了。</p>
<p>靠着這河流，有幾千畝的稻田和桑田每年豐收着，也就是有幾百戶的人家生存着。他們全是龍游河的子孫，他們感激着，愛護着。</p>
<p>除了幾百戶的人家以外，龍游河還有着一個寄養的兒子——那是靠了他而生存的唯一的漁家。</p>
<p>這漁家在龍游河的下游，一間低矮簡陋的茅草棚、便是他們生活游息之所。屋子裏住着一個年老的漁翁、一個差不多樣兒的老婆婆、和一個年靑的兒子</p>
<p>三個人住在這兒、已經有了一份悠久的時日。老年的失妻記得最淸楚，他們從自己的故鄕搖了一隻艒艒船出來，便在這裏靠捕魚過日子，漸漸的能把幾擔泥土幾擔茅柴架成這棚子；後來是怎麽買起一口大盤網，和養出這樣一個兒子。老年的夫妻更淸楚的，是他們所以會有現在這般的地步，完全是靠龍游河的恩賜。河是他們的故鄉，河是他們的工塲。</p>
<p>暮色裏已辨不淸一切景物了，立在大盤網的轆轤那裏的老漁翁便提高了嗓子喊：</p>
<p>「小狗子娘，怎麽還不把桅燈點起來呢？」</p>
<p>小狗子娘正在行灶邊燒著夜飯。沒有烟囱的行灶，把烟全騰向了小狗子娘身邊，使她老花的眼睛不能好好睜著。聽得外面老頭子的喊聲、正想立起來時，老漁翁又喊著了：</p>
<p>「塞聾了耳朶嗎？這麽個不知要緊不要緊的鬼老太婆。……快點啦，有一尾大靑魚在　裏了。」</p>
<p>邊喊著，邊更用力地把大盤網的轆　上的「絞手」絞着。他覺得網漸漸重起來了；心想，定有一尾大靑魚在網裏；他大槪是從湖裏逆水游來的。這條魚總有三二十斤，哈哈、賣起來有好幾塊大花洋錢啦。想着想着，不禁更高興，臉上泛了一層微笑。</p>
<p>老婆子把桅燈提了來。一顆豆大的火花、照不到一丈多遠的地方。她把他掛在草棚前的一個竹鈎上。便走近轆　邊、帮着老漁翁盤絞着，兩個人用盡了殘年的力，心裏全存着極度的歡喜。</p>
<p>恰巧到街上去沽酒的兒子也回來了，便也來帮助，盤呀盤的、把一口大網高掛在河面了。兒子急忙把「揷魚網」去打撈，可是無論如何打撈不起，不禁疑心起來。等老漁翁把桅燈去照看的時侯、網裏殭直地橫着一個浮腫的孩子的尸體、他不禁「啊——喲」地　住了。</p>
<h3 id="c221">紫籐花架下 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 陳里昂</p>
<p>這一天下午，抽着一支烟踱出屋子來，那樣地寬鬆，沒一點心事逗留在情緒裏。午飯之前我還打算要做不少事情，家裏來的信擱置五天了，該覆，自己箱篋裏已找不出一雙完好的襪子，該買、硯池裏墨膏積得很厚，該洗……可是，當我吸進第一口烟的時候，又以爲那點事可以緩做了。有時我自己亦會奇怪，「爲什麽這樣懶呵？」好許多日子來了，我都帶着這股懶勁兒過着。</p>
<p>我的天性是好閒的，我的環境却沒有閒，我偏傷要從忙碌中去攝取閒逸，丟開了應該幹的事而過意的閒處着，而並不感覺着不安、亦不顧人家的物議。我自以只有在閒適的時候，才能體味得人生的眞趣，雖說，這不是眞正的閒適，却亦很滿足了，這勢口的人們，那一個不爲着自己的生活而忽忙憂慮着呢，能够獲得眞正閒適的生活的人，又能有幾個呢？</p>
<p>這確是我平素養成的癖性，我會把甚麽俗冗都擺脫掉的，但我亦爲着生活而忽忙，有時額上滲出汗粒，足底跑出水泡，手臂動作得酸痛，腦筋爲外界的形色纏擾得模糊昏眩，然而，我的心境却常常是閒適的，在公事車裏，我會吸着烟，讀着日報的副刋，茶至有時候連日子亦會忙記。朋友們都說我太糊塗，並不想否認，許是這時期，這人世，只有糊塗者才戚到一些樂趣吧。</p>
<p>便含着烟在院子裏的紫　花架下坐着，是雨把花朶激發開的，亦是雨把花朶打謝了，花瓣片片，散在土　砌成的院地上，一條靑灰色布疋織出紫色花點兒似的，有着靜逸的美感。於是，這美感的吸力，亦把我的心靈拮出，揑得粉碎的，跟花瓣一塊兒散亂在濕滑的磚地上了。</p>
<p>院子到處敗落得不堪了，連紫藤花架亦很朽腐得趨於傾覆的狀態，近地的那幾根柱子穿着碧綠色的靑苔套褲，葉和花一年比一年稀疏，不知還是它自己年老衰痿？還是它適應那朽腐的花架的環境？可是，我亦正愛着這種不康健的病態的姿容，還得僥倖我那院子主人的家道中落，否則、這古時風的瓦屋，長了靑苔的木架，窈窕的紫籐，綠翠琢成的葉和紫色的冷艷的花片、早就變成士敏土，鐵骨·朱漆·石塊，醜惡的現代文明的物質了。</p>
<p>人們的愛憎是有差別的，許多人或許要皺眉兒、說我的居處充溢着頽唐和死氣，他們愛好那巨魔似的洋樓，剪軋得截平的冬靑，白石小潭裏的金魚、鐵質欄杆，和有着刺激色調的大花朵，而這許多，在我們的眼光裏，又偏偏以爲醜惡庸俗的。我不慣接觸那富貴氣息，我不忍見那批在名利塲中角逐而不稍知自休的人。許是，他們同時亦在斥我孤僻而鄙陋吧！</p>
<p>然而，我仍安之若素的、每天，我仍會偸閒在紫藤花架下小坐，吸着烟，看一點自己所愛好的書籍，這時，我會忘掉我應該去做的事，和應該回憶一下的過去。紫籐花架下，是找不出一些忽忙的情緒，一些名利的思謀，和一些富貴氣息的。</p>

<h3 id="c225">賀浦曼綁案審判新聞片攝製之經過（下） <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— 新尼</p>
<p>從上面却利福特的談話，我們可以看到在法庭中拍攝有聲影片，並沒有違法的地方，而是經過法官明白的允諾的。但是攝影師却亦有其取巧的地方，我們可以加以叙述的。</p>
<p>我們根據美國影業權威的機關報，電影導報之所載，容判長鄧却事前曾吩咐，在法庭內拍攝新聞影片，祗限於犯人不在被吿欄內被審問的時候。那就是說，祗可以拍攝犯人閒坐時動作談話的形狀，而不許拍犯人在欄內受審時之狀態也。</p>
<p>但是公司方面的攝影員，却故意違犯了這個命令。法庭方面，爲慎重及預防新聞記者私拍影片起見，等到犯人登欄的時候，特令庭丁將庭內一切爲攝影而特別裝置的燈光，全部熄滅，並且將窗帘拉下了一半，使庭內光線暗澹，無從私拍影片。但是近代攝影的技術，却瞞過了法官，因爲攝影師利用了極度迅速的鏡頭，以及特別定製的極度迅速感光的影片，竟在犯人受審之時，庭中一切情景盡情的攝人了鏡頭。</p>
<p>當然這種影片拍攝之時，是不能有機件搖動的聲音的。這亦須事先特別在開末拉上，有無聲的裝置。再則人亦不能站在開末拉旁邊，而是隱藏在數十尺以外，將電線剪斷了，用電流的斷續以控制攝影機的行止的。當然這些技巧，非老於此道者不能成功的。</p>
<p>但是我們不得不再提提第二個問題。那就是這種罪犯影片，是不是應當加以攝製，以及它本身有沒有存在的價値。在這一點上，紐約的檢察長及罪犯學家道治氏曾有如下的一篇談話發表。</p>
<p>「一般的說來，我對於一切影片，無論其爲新聞短片，或是戲劇長片，如其係描寫罪犯，以及犯罪的嫌疑者之行動的，我一律的不贊成而主張加以禁止的。我以爲這種影片，和兒童發生了接觸之後，會發生不良的影饗的。就是成年之人，如果他的腦筋思想沒有成年，那他看了罪犯影片，由於犯罪及抵觸刑法的行爲，所包含的一種義勇光榮的誤解，亦會使他走入歧途的。</p>
<p>「至於賀浦曼審問時的影片，我却覺得還不如此之壞。犯人在檢察長威侖資燃炬的目光之前，受他尖刃似的利舌襲擊之下，那種畏罪惶悚，愧　無狀的形狀，足以表示一個人犯了罪，終久逃不出法網，非但犯法不是一條康莊大道，並且在被逮之後，亦不是可以一死了之的。</p>
<p>「那種精神上痛苦的表現，使凡有知覺的人，都可以知道一個人犯罪之後，匹夫之勇，從容就死的决心，到了那時亦失了用塲，而不得不戰慄畏懼，欲死不得的。但是多數人看來，不過給與一個德國的木匠，一個無上的宣傳而已。、</p>
<p>「無論如何，我以爲在罪犯尙未判决之前，這種影片是不應當公映的。」</p>
<p>以上是一位紐約的檢察官的意見，亦是一般美國檢察官大多數的意見。我們現在還要聽聽一位名律師，及犯人辯訴員，薩謬爾勒卜威茲氏的意見。</p>
<p>勒氏的意見是。「我非但沒有看見那張新聞片，我亦不想去看。我想那種影片，是大家不應當去看的。我極端的反對，對於一個犯人，或是一件罪案，這種極端煊染的宣傳。我認爲這是美國新聞政策的通病。但是病，我們旣然答應了許多新聞記者，以及小　說家，坐在法庭裏，用主動妻參的筆墨，描寫犯人在證人　中　觫的形狀，我們爲什麽單單要和新聞攝影員爲難，而不許他們更進一層，有聲有色的給那犯人一個更悚然的寫眞呢？當然，影片是淸晰無疑的，但是新聞記者的筆墨，却有些靠不住。一個說犯人觳觫得無地自容，而另一個却說犯人態度鎭靜，愍不畏死，不知誰說得對。</p>
<p>「如果我們的審判制度，採取英國尊嚴的態度，而不像現在三等三級看馬戲的情形，新聞影片的拍攝，當然就不成爲問題。</p>
<p>總而言之，我不想去看這種影片。並不是因爲我對於法庭中的情形，無庸再去看得，我根本上不贊成大家去看，因爲化錢去看，就是對於這種影片製作的鼓勵，間接的就是鼓勵視法庭爲兒戲，當審判如看馬戲也。</p>
<p>「至於攝影員違背庭令，偷攝影片，尤其卑鄙可恨之事，應當受嚴厲的處分的。」（完）</p>

<p>— 兆仁</p>
<p>——新光映</p>
<p>從「風」以後，導演吳邨是以新的姿態出現在中國影壇。人們對於他屬望很高、相信他服給與我們不少新鮮的藝術食糧。</p>
<p>是的，這靑年的導演有着正視現實的熱情和勇氣，他有着憤懣的心情對現社會表示了他的否定。他有着正義的熱情，對於醜惡常位示着他的嫉恨。不過他也是一個過於聰明的藝術家，他太懂得了處世的機智，於是對於塵世的俗惡，不肯作正面的攻擊，而祗是對於醜惡、企圖用着細緻的筆觸、從側面去接觸，企圖在人們的歡笑之中、來一些辛辣的譏諷。但是他由表現技術的生疏，力不從心的並不能把握他所要表現的對象。他對現實並不是不批判，而是不知道怎樣去批判。卽使是譏諷的暴露也罷、然而他並不能尖銳的去觸發高貴的人們的內心的隱情。於是他的譏諷只是浮面的，象徵的，像風」中大風吹破了紳士的高帽或淑女的內衣一樣。同樣，他在正反面的對照之下、也沒有把握的同情他所要同情的人羣。</p>
<p>更主要的，在他的作品中表現着他的知識份的氣味非常濃厚。他的視界很寬，同時他自我滿足的慾望也非常熱烈。他要在一部作品中表現到全部所能感覺的東西、他不肯也不能篩濾他的情感集中在某一點主要的目的事物上。於是他熱情的縱橫奔放，在作品上却顯得綜‘錯零亂，幾乎是沒有整理過他的題材似的。</p>
<p>然而他熱情的表現、也祇是在「風」中汹湧的澎湃着，在「落花時節」中，他似乎是經過某種重大的打擊似的，在傷感的氣氛中表示若他的消極。現在我們就「落花時節」再來觀察一下。</p>
<p>「落花時節」和風一樣　表現着一種良好的用心。這以義勇軍的艱苦作戰，在內無援救，餉盡彈絕的情形之下、義勇軍是在强敵的壓迫之下犧牲的敗北了。作者一方面在兵士趙旦的口中說到，即使是肉搏也要抵抗到底、而另一方面却以知識份子的威傷，「流水落花春去也」的表示他對於國事的哀怨。這裏以落花來襯托民族戰爭的敗北，固然極不相宜，在殘酷的戰爭的進行中，怯　詩人的落花流水的戚喟，春閨幽怨的惆悵，决不能吻合民族戰爭的悲壯。……這落花的哀怨，一直繼續到阿萱的死，在工人們的地下室中也有落花，在醫院裏也有落花。……一貫的傷感下去。然而到後來他也覺得這樣不大好，所以又在一個落花時節，華北戰雲緊急。戰士們又上前綫去，來一個傷戚反面的積極的收尾。然而這積極性是在傷感的氣氛中消失了的，卽是說傷戚是作者主要描寫的東西，積極的收塲、不過表現他不得不如此罷了。</p>
<p>在其一小的地方，也許可以若干的看出作者若干程度急進一點，如「風」中是象徵的以風來譏諷紳土淑女們的虛僞，而在「落花時節」中他是假手於印刷工人撕毀華貴的夜禮服。但是在表現手法上，作者始終是不能越出知識份子的範圍，他對於上流社會不熱悉，和不熟悉下層生活完全一樣。他完全是憑着自己的想像，再加上因有的羅曼蒂克，所以不能給與人們若干眞實感。也許我們承認在「重婚」中他是比較進行得很順利，這因爲僅寫到知識份子曾經經歷的熟悉的東西的原故。他不能比較嚴密的組織劇情，和「風」一樣的前後左右不相聯接，如從地下室突然寫到時裝公司，觀衆完全不懂。再加上幾次的回想與倒叙，都是一般觀衆不熟悉的。徐來的課背，除了生意眼的賣弄之下、我們不知道傷痕的來源。……此外不必多說了。</p>
<p>總之，「落花時節」因着作者對於劇中人的姓格沒有明確的規定，除了趙丹很懂得做戲而且很賣力以外，連演技上也沒有多大的成就。</p>

<p>亦不知經過了幾百千人，男女們的名字，她都記不淸了。他們都傾心於她，拜倒在她的纖纖玉趾之前，但她在寵衰恩絕的時候，却不屑加以一蹴。她，個一個的，對於他們表示厭倦了。她香肩微聳，露着「我倦欲眠卿且去」的神情，而昨夜的情人，今朝已黃粱夢醒，覺到好景不可留，　然而退了。</p>
<p>但是其中有一個人，他却不甘菲薄，不肯像別人的那樣，呼之即來，揮之即去。他就是唐派斯瓜。他身材魁梧，性情暴厲，但他對於康嘉，却是一往情深，甘爲情死。他家世貴胄身居軍界要職。康嘉覺得他的地位，財力，在在都可利用，就不時假以詞色，而派斯瓜亦就神魂顚倒，惟命是從了。這樣，康嘉，還有她那貪財的母親，對於他是予取予求，而派斯瓜爲要博得美人歡心，莫不惟命是從的。</p>
<p>派斯瓜家雖富有，但怎經得起康嘉無厭之求，所以經過了若干時期，派斯瓜已經到了床頭金盡，徒　奈何之時。他非但財盡家毀，並且身敗名裂，不能再厠身於軍旅，而他軍異的位置，亦因此不得不辭去。他經過了這一次失意幻滅，在悔恨之餘，他的愛就變成了讐恨。他立誓將用其有生之日，警吿其他靑年，勿近那蛇蝎心腸的舞女。</p>
<p>那是安達羅薩城的狂歡節，一個遠客翩然蒞臨了。他是一個容色麗都的美少年。他的名字，叫做安東尼加爾溫。他本來不應當脚踏西班牙的土地的，因爲他宣揚共和，煽動革命的原因，被政府當局通緝而亡命國外的。這次他因爲思母心切，特喬裝冒了生命的危險，回國來省視母親。他在旗幟飄揚，花團錦簇的街上走著，忽然他看見了一個絕世佳人，他不覺爲之目眙神往，速呼吸都停止了。</p>
<p>不錯的，他所看見的女人，正是西班牙的紅舞給康嘉。她坐在一輛金碧輝煌的馬車裏，在安東尼的身，疾駛而過。安東尼於心神撩亂之餘，不知不覺的就緊緊的跟在她馬車的後面，一直跟到她的家裏。</p>
<p>很奇怪的，康嘉見了這位美少年，亦不生氣，反而很高興，因爲有這樣一位美少年，爲之如此一見傾心，是她所最喜歡的。他不知道這是康嘉勾引新羅曼斯入港的故技。他求着她，要她答應明日下午再和他相會。她亦一口答應了。</p>
<p>到了明天，安東尼正想如期赴約，可是他不期而遇的，碰見了派斯瓜。因爲派斯瓜亦是他的老友，所以他們談話之中，安東尼就將他的奇遇全盤托出，吿訴了派斯瓜。（未完）</p>

<p>Huge Requisitions Greatly Hinder People's Livelihood; When Needed, Purchase Should Be the Principle</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Nanjing Municipal Government reported that in recent times, various agencies in Nanjing have been requisitioning land for construction, often exceeding the amount actually needed. The land requisitioned often amounts to hundreds or thousands of acres, and the number of households affected can reach dozens or even hundreds. After the landowners are requisitioned, their source of production is cut off, and they are forced to scatter and flee. Although land requisition has compensation for land prices, excessive requisition and insufficient compensation, the income from the official land price is only 10% to 50% of the actual value. Even if the compensation is adequate, those who are accustomed to their old businesses, getting the money but losing the land, also find it difficult to make a living. Such large-scale requisition cases greatly hinder people's livelihood. The Municipal Government has submitted the report to the Executive Yuan, requesting the National Government to instruct various agencies in Nanjing to restrict requisitioning of land in the future, except for opening roads, constructing schools, and other public facilities that benefit the local people. In the future, the principle of purchasing should be followed when private land is needed. (Special dispatch from the 28th)</p>

<h3 id="e33">The Premise of Chinese Industrial Control <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce believes that the reasons for the increasing decline of industry in our country are: (1) The industrial sector is like a heap of loose sand, insufficient to resist the dumping of foreign industrial products. (2) The industries in our country squeeze each other, resulting in overproduction. Therefore, it specially submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to implement industrial controls in order to save our country's industry, which is on the verge of collapse.  Before the Great War, the economic thinking of the world mostly advocated laissez-faire economics, emphasizing free competition, and following the laws of natural selection. After the Great War, the thinking changed drastically. Most countries advocated controlled economics, seeking planning and control in all production and consumption. When the world panic occurred and the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan was completed, the trend of controlled thinking became more prevalent. Gradually, today, it has further advanced to the "Autarky" of national economicism. However, laissez-faire economics and controlled economics are inherently products of the evolution of the times. Before and after the 18th-century Industrial Revolution, new technologies were not yet developed, and the old systems were shaking. It was inevitable to hope that a laissez-faire economic policy would promote the gradual development of a new economic society. However, today, more than a hundred years after the Industrial Revolution, the economic society produced by the Industrial Revolution has many drawbacks. Therefore, one cannot but hope for a controlled economic policy to correct them. For this reason, the transition of various countries from laissez-faire economics to controlled economics all has a relationship with their historical environment. The policy itself has no absolute good or evil.</p>
<p>However, the situation in our country today is not entirely similar to that of other countries. Therefore, if our country also implements economic controls today, its goals, steps, and methods must also be different from those of other countries. To elaborate, other countries implement controls because of the development of production and the desire to maintain the existing economic system. Therefore, when they implement controls, they only seek to prevent overproduction, which is sufficient. However, our country today implements controls because of the backwardness of production, and to transform the economy. It is clearly insufficient to only seek a reduction in production and the non-aggression of the same industry.</p>
<p>In recent years, there has also been talk of overproduction in China. However, this is only a superficial phenomenon. In reality, if the current production is evenly distributed among 500 million people, it is not only not excessive, but also insufficient. Therefore, the so-called surplus is actually an unnatural surplus. This unnatural surplus is due to the narrow sales channels of products. Therefore, the current problems facing China's industry lie in how to seek sales channels for industrial products, improve the economic status quo, and increase the purchasing power of the people. That is the first thing. Seeking improvement in production technology to reduce production costs is the second thing. Resisting foreign goods to preserve economic strength is the third thing. If we can strive to complete these three things, and add thorough controls, then how can China's current situation not be improved? Otherwise, if all the conditions for developing industry are not met, and we rashly implement controls to reduce production or maintain the status quo, then I am afraid that the effect of the controls will not be seen, but it will give foreign goods the opportunity to dump at low prices. This is something that the Chinese people must not fail to observe.</p>

<p>(London) A "Daily Express" report states that naval, army, and air force generals held a secret meeting at the Campbell Military Academy to discuss the thorough reorganization of the British naval and air forces in the Far East and to formulate a cooperation plan between the navy, army, and air force. The level of close cooperation is unprecedented in British history. The generals, in view of the mutual constraints and delays in military agencies during the European War, have also agreed on methods of improvement. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Saint Peter, USA. The plan for the U.S. fleet's large-scale Pacific maneuvers has now been completed and is ready to depart at any time upon order. The most famous of the maneuver plans is "Problem Sixteen." The details are still kept secret by the naval authorities. However, it is understood that this maneuver will pay special attention to the defense of the islands along the Alaskan coast and the sea area between Midway Island and Pearl Harbor. Early next week, 153 warships will depart from here and Pearl Harbor. The maneuvers will officially begin on May 3. The "attacking" fleet will be led by Commander Hepburn, while the "defending" fleet along the Pacific coast will be commanded by Commander Laning. In terms of air power, in addition to the aircraft carried on the maneuvering warships, there will be 430 other aircraft participating at the same time. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>

<p>(Washington) The naval and government authorities are very puzzled by the claim in Japanese newspapers that the United States is unwilling to resume naval talks and are strongly denying any action that has given rise to this impression. The United States has repeatedly expressed its support for continuing the London Conference. However, the United States particularly wants Britain to initiate it. Since Japan demanded naval equality, leading to the breakdown of the conference, there has been no exchange of official documents between countries regarding this matter to date. At the same time, Commander Stanley, Director of the Naval Personnel Assignment Office, told the Associated Press that the naval exercises to be held next week are not an action against Japan. During all the exercises, the U.S. fleet will be more than two thousand miles away from Japan proper. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>

If the situation is indeed urgent, these coastal bases must be seized to prevent the enemy from using them to attack us. General Andrews did not specify what he meant by an emergency situation.

<p>(Berlin) Officials refuse to comment on rumors that Germany is violating the treaty by building several submarines. However, according to diplomatic sources, senior German naval personnel have recently been very active in seeking information on the latest post-war submarines and bombers. According to unverified rumors, the German government has ordered several submarines from the Stone State Shipyard, and the engines needed will be built at the Irping Factory.

<p>(London) Naval experts from Britain and Germany were originally scheduled to hold informal talks in early May. According to the "Daily Herald," a mouthpiece of the Labour Party, Germany will propose a request at the talks to be allowed to build five high-sided armored cruisers, seven dreadnoughts, sixteen cruisers, fifty torpedo boat destroyers, and fifty submarines. It is expected that Britain will definitely reject this, and Germany will implement this plan regardless of whether Britain allows it or not. The newspaper also said that Germany has recently decided to build 12 submarines immediately. This is not what Britain wants to hear, and the naval experts' talks between Britain and Germany are very likely to be cancelled. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>

<p>(Paris) Soviet Ambassador Potemkin continued to discuss the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact with Foreign Minister Laval, which lasted for more than two hours. The two sides exchanged views and reviewed the articles submitted by the other. Potemkin intends to report the results of the talks in the past two days to his government before continuing the discussions. The general impression is still smooth. The Soviet government is making efforts to understand the views of France (France advocates that the Mutual Assistance Pact should be integrated with the constraints stipulated in the Locarno Pact). The work of organizing the articles of the Mutual Assistance Pact can be completed in the middle of next week, and Laval and Potemkin will initial it. When Laval goes to Russia at the beginning of next month, he will formally sign it.

<p>(Paris) The negotiations between France and Russia on the Mutual Assistance Pact have not yet been finalized.

According to semi-official sources, the two diplomats thoroughly discussed several unresolved points. Potemkin has now reported to Moscow and, after receiving a reply, will resume negotiations with the French Foreign Minister tomorrow or Tuesday. It is heard that the two governments have completely agreed on the fundamental principle of mutual assistance within the framework of the League of Nations Covenant. However, the Russian government is willing to take military action first, followed by the procedures of the League of Nations. The French government's wishes are exactly the opposite. It is expected that a compromise can be reached in the end. Although it does not stipulate automatic military action, it will make actions in accordance with the League of Nations Covenant more convenient and practical. It is now believed that the pact will be initialed next week when the French Foreign Minister goes to Moscow. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Paris) It is said today that the military alliance between France and Russia has been delayed again. Spokespersons for both governments have stated that this delay is a technical issue.

<p>Bucharest, Romania. The National Defense Council met today, chaired by King Carol II, and unanimously approved the plan proposed by the Tatarescu cabinet to increase army equipment. This plan should be implemented gradually over several years. Part of the funds needed will be used to issue national equipment public bonds. In addition, the government has launched new taxes, and the actual revenue is far above expectations, which can also be used for this purpose, so raising funds is very easy. Tatarescu announced that the government has signed a contract with the Czech Skoda armaments factory to undertake various army equipment. In 1932, Romanian police found some suspicious documents in the Skoda factory's office in Bucharest and arrested the factory representative, Serezheski, and sentenced him to prison for espionage. This case has been pending for a long time. Today, Finance Minister Endronescu announced to the National Defense Committee that the government has signed an agreement with the Skoda factory to completely resolve this county case, so the contract for undertaking army equipment can be signed smoothly.

Therefore, those who engage in mental labor should not ignore the national life. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>(Moscow) The People's Committee has recently decided to develop the country's animal husbandry, planning to increase 10 million cattle, 17 million pigs, 16 million sheep, and 2 million horses. After the Russian Civil War, animal husbandry declined greatly. The current government is working hard to revitalize it. In addition, the Food Commission has also decided to build a railway from Arta on the east coast of the Black Sea to Dugong to Akhalsiche. The road line requires the construction of 120 kilometers of embankments to avoid passing through Baku and bypassing the Caucasus Mountains, which can shorten the route by 700 kilometers. It is estimated that it will be completed by 1937. This road is extremely important in terms of economy, military strategy, and travel. After the road is built, the manganese produced by the Republic of Georgia can be transported to central and southern Russia via this road. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>(Washington) The Treasury Department was brightly lit tonight, with leaders of the New Deal debating two issues: whether to revise the silver policy and how to compensate China and Mexico for the losses they have suffered due to the U.S. silver program. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau stated today that the government would not announce any changes to the price of purchasing domestically mined silver by the end of this week. Today, Democratic Senator McCarran told a new reporter that he had</p>
<p>(Washington) discussed the general silver situation with Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, but the Secretary did not indicate what actions the government would take. (Reuters, 27th) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau also announced today that the Treasury Department would not change the silver purchase price before next Monday. Prior to this announcement, reporters had been waiting for a long time, hoping that the government would issue an important statement at any moment, changing the silver policy. Observers believe that the Secretary's words today mean that the Treasury Department is working closely with President Roosevelt and is still considering several feasible methods. Before a definite policy is decided, the existing state will be maintained. On Wall Street, there are rumors that the government intends to drastically increase both gold and silver prices to prevent speculators from taking advantage of the government's monetary system plan. However, these rumors have not been confirmed by reliable sources. Democratic Senator McCarran consulted with the Treasury Secretary for a long time and later told the press that the Secretary has become more in favor of the plan to re-establish silver as the U.S. monetary standard at a price of $1.29 per ounce. Former Treasury officials and New Deal authorities are all paying close attention to the silver issue. The most concerned are the adverse results of the U.S. silver policy on China and Mexico. Now, the Bank of Mexico has completely closed, and the new currency system policy has taken effect. Mexican Finance Ministry Special Envoy Robles has arrived here by plane, preparing to consult with Treasury Secretary Morgenthau. However, Treasury officials said that Robles would not be able to meet with Morgenthau until the beginning of next week. It is reported that Robles will raise a serious protest against the U.S. silver policy in person. However, observers say that the U.S.'s new policy will also be decided before the protest is officially filed. The plans currently being considered by the Treasury Department are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Immediately set the Treasury Department's silver purchase price at $1.29; (2) Continue to purchase domestically produced raw silver at a price slightly higher than the world silver price; (3) Purchase entirely according to world market prices, without favoring domestically produced silver; (4) Purchase raw silver at a price of $1 per ounce.</p>
<p>The Treasury Secretary has repeatedly stated that the U.S. will continue to purchase silver until the silver price reaches $1.29, or until the Treasury's silver reserves reach a ratio of four parts silver to one part gold. Government leaders are paying close attention to the speculation that has arisen around the world. New Wall Street is rumored to believe that the government will immediately raise the silver price to the statutory maximum limit in order to prevent it. According to experts, the U.S. will probably not raise the silver price above $1.29, as this action would be tantamount to further devaluing the U.S. dollar. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Mexico Bans Silver Exports</p>
<p>Mexico City: The Mexican government today implemented its newly enacted currency system policy, banning the export of silver coins and silver bars, and replacing various silver coins with paper money. All banks have been ordered to close until next Monday. Raw silver is not included under the export ban. The purpose of this ban is to prevent the melting of silver coins. Now, the government has nationalized all existing silver. The lowest denomination paper money is one peso. An order was also issued this morning establishing a coin reserve system to replace the Bank of Mexico's reserve. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Issuance of Small Denomination Paper Subsidiary Currency</p>
<p>Mexico City: After ordering the recall of silver coins circulating in the market yesterday, the government announced that it would issue small denomination paper notes of one peso each to supplement the currently circulating paper money. It is now expected that the exchange rate of pesos to U.S. dollars will be set at a new price of 3.5 pesos per U.S. dollar. It is said that the government's decision was forced by the soaring silver prices caused by the U.S. silver policy. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Preventing Speculative Profiteering</p>
<p>Mexico City: President General Cárdenas recently issued a proclamation to the people, stating that after the rise in silver prices, speculative behavior immediately followed. The government, in order to curb this, had no choice but to recall hard currency and replace it with paper money. However, if speculators try to take advantage of the situation to profit, the government will deal with them severely and without hesitation. He hopes that the people of the whole country will cooperate with the government so that such severe measures can be avoided. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>Silver Price Falls Four Points</p>
<p>(Washington) The price set by the Treasury Department for purchasing silver will not change before Sunday. In the markets of Montreal, Canada, and New York, the price of silver has already fallen four points compared to yesterday due to the unpredictable actions of the U.S. government. At this time, the amount purchased by the government is very small. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>Impact on Japan</p>
<p>(Tokyo) As for the impact on Japan of China effectively banning silver exports, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan, Fukai, told reporters, "The extent to which China has actually banned silver exports is still unclear, so it is not possible to clearly state the precise impact. However, it would be premature to say that banning silver exports will immediately have a major impact on Japan's trade with China. The question is what the general trend in the Chinese financial world will be after the ban. If the financial world is stable, there will be no problem; otherwise, we must consider the impact on Japan." (Dentsu, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) If the United States does not change its silver purchase policy, China's financial world will inevitably fall into a chaotic breakdown, which is undoubtedly true. As a result, Japan's trade with China will be affected, but there are optimistic and pessimistic views on the impact. Pessimists say that if China's financial world breaks down, China's purchasing power will decline, which will deal a fatal blow to trade with China, which is expected to improve this year. Since the United States raised silver prices in mid-month, the number of export transactions to China in the Kansai region has already declined sharply. Therefore, it cannot be said that China's financial breakdown has no impact on trade. Optimists say that even if China's financial world breaks down, from an overall point of view, it is only a breakdown of the Shanghai financial world, and it has nothing to do with the purchasing power of inland China. In particular, the recent increase in Japan's exports to China is for necessities. Therefore, due to the exchange rate relationship, Japanese goods, which are internationally in a favorable position, should not be affected by exports to China. (Dentsu, 28th)</p>

<p>— Special Correspondent for this Newspaper, Geng Ya</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Governance and Customs of Chang'an County</p>
<p>Chang'an is the premier county in Guanzhong, bordering Lan to the east, Kun and Xianyang to the west, with the Qinling Mountains to the south, and the Wei and Jing Rivers to the north. It covers an area of approximately sixty to seventy li from east to west and over a hundred li from north to south, totaling more than six thousand square li. Excluding the urban area (Xijing City), the county government's survey report from the twentieth year of the Republic (1931) indicated a rural population of over 280,000. Recent reorganization of the Baojia system and a more detailed survey revealed 65,220 households with a population of 444,530, with males outnumbering females at a ratio of six to four. The population density is approximately forty-six to forty-seven people per square li. The substantial population increase in the county within three years suggests inaccuracies in previous surveys, but it can also be interpreted as a sign of Chang'an's future development. According to County Magistrate Weng Cheng, the county's various conditions are as follows:</p>
<p>Changyi County has an area of over six thousand square li, equivalent to approximately three million mu. However, only 27,572 mu are cultivated as paddy fields and 1,692,785 mu as dry land, totaling 1,730,457 mu. These are the lands subject to grain tax. The remainder is uncultivated or mountainous land, but reclamation and afforestation are possible. The grain tax levy ranges from 2.2 to over 3.4 jiao per mu for civilian land (ordinary people's land), 2.5 to 5.4 jiao for military land (land for supporting the military), and 6.5 jiao to 1.6 yuan for royal land (reclaimed wasteland). The annual tax collection reaches several hundred and forty-three thousand yuan. After deducting grain taxes lost due to floods and the occupation of farmland by highways, the actual revenue is approximately four million two hundred thousand yuan. In addition, miscellaneous tax revenues, such as deed tax, brokerage tax, local tax funds, urban slaughter and transaction tax, and rural livestock slaughter and transaction tax, total around two hundred thousand yuan.</p>
<p>The county's primary education consists of twenty-four county-run schools, including twenty-five senior primary grades and eighty-three junior primary grades, with a total of 4,337 students. There are thirteen private schools, with 2,863 students in senior and junior grades. Additionally, there are 353 private tutorial schools that have been converted into junior primary schools but are not yet officially registered, with 8,658 students. In total, there are 390 schools with 15,858 students, including 14,395 male students and 1,463 female students. The annual expenditure is 87,268 yuan. (Note: Comparing the total number of students in the county to the total population, on average, only one in thirty-six or thirty-seven people is a school-aged child, indicating that school education still needs to be promoted.) In terms of social education, there is one existing public education center and a public reading room attached to the county government building.</p>
<p>Since ancient times, Chang'an has been a battlefield. Distant events such as the Yellow Turban Rebellion, the Five Barbarians Uprising, and the rebellions of Huang Chao and Li Zicheng all ravaged the area. More recently, the Muslim rebellion at the end of the Qing dynasty, the southward crossing of Zhang Yian's Jingguo Army, and Yang Hucheng's defense with the National Revolutionary Army all led to the suburbs of Chang'an becoming battlefields due to the easy access and lack of defensible terrain. The current county jurisdiction has four guard corps, divided into twelve squads, totaling ninety-six guardsmen. The annual expenditure is over eighteen thousand yuan. The corps are stationed in Yinjiahui, Sanqiao, Xinzhu, and Doumen towns, and are equipped with telephone communication, enabling timely information dissemination and ensuring peace and security in the region.</p>
<p>The majority of the people are engaged in agriculture, followed by commerce. Industry is not emphasized. No factories are established in the urban and rural areas. Only in Beizhang Village in the 35th district are people engaged in the traditional manufacture of straw paper and hemp paper. In the 6th district, some are engaged in weaving various bamboo implements. Residents near the mountains engage in firewood gathering and charcoal burning during the agricultural off-season, but the labor is intensive with little profit. The main agricultural product is wheat. Rice is mainly produced in areas bordering the Nanshan Mountains in Hu County. Opium production was very high in previous years. Since the beginning of last spring, an order was issued to prohibit the planting of opium seedlings, and the order was strictly enforced. Over a period of three months, the cleanup was completed. More than one hundred thousand mu of opium seedlings were eradicated. Although there were previous prohibitions, the people regarded them as mere formalities due to the repeated cycles of prohibition and relaxation. As a result, this eradication involved such a large area. Landowners who had their opium crops eradicated were given cotton seeds to plant as compensation. Nineteen cotton production cooperatives, eleven cotton production and marketing cooperatives, four agricultural production cooperatives, and forty-two credit cooperatives were established. Loans totaling more than two hundred thousand yuan were obtained from the Bank of China, Shanghai Bank, Shaanxi Provincial Bank, and other banks. The banks lend to the cooperatives at a monthly interest rate of eight li, and the cooperatives lend to their members and farmers at a rate of twelve li. The four li profit is allocated as follows: 20% for the cooperative's public reserve fund, 20% for the operational staff's compensation, and the remainder for the cooperative's compulsory education fund. Pig farming is the main source of farmers' side income. The director of the public education center, Yang Xingrong, has purchased several Berkshire pigs from Ding County to improve the pig breeds and promote breeding. Many poor rural women work as domestic servants in wealthy households, known locally as "shang zao" (tending the stove), or are hired for long-term employment, known as "la chang gong" (pulling long labor). The employers provide them with coarse food and lodging, and they earn only five or six yuan per year, making their lives quite difficult.</p>
<p>Land ownership in the various villages is not very concentrated. Both public and private entities exercise land rights within the bounds of the law. Tenant farmers have perpetual tenancy rights but no freedom to sell. Land prices have recently been rising due to improved transportation and the completion of various canals. Land near the railway station, which previously cost forty or fifty yuan per mu, has now risen to around two thousand yuan. Government land is divided into three grades, with the highest selling price reaching eighteen hundred yuan. Large family systems are still very common in the villages. The concept of five generations living under one roof and clan support are considered praiseworthy. Families have heads, and clans have elders. Most matters, large and small, are decided by the family or clan head. Small family systems are only found in the cities.</p>
<p>Entertainment organizations include the People's Drama Troupe under the county party headquarters, and ancient music societies in the city organize ancient music performances every June. There are also the Xijing Epigraphy and Calligraphy Exhibition and the Xijing Painting and Calligraphy Association, which are open to visitors at any time to cultivate the public's aesthetic interests. Social drama troupes include the Yisu, Sanyi, Zhengsu, and Youmin Qinqiang opera troupes, and the Xin Wutai Beijing opera troupe. There are also the Afanggong and Xijing Cinemas. However, these are all located in the city. In the villages, old-style plays are occasionally performed on earthen stages.</p>
<p>The urban area is a mix of people from different places with diverse dialects. The basic local dialect pronounces "shu" (comb) and "shu" (book) as "fu," "rou" (meat) as "wu," "shui" (water) as "fei," "zamen" (we) as "zaimen," and "anmen" (we) as "men." "Bi" (pen) is called "shenghuo" (living), (as it is in Lanzhou). "Mianbao" (bread) is called "momo." "Moving slowly" is called "mu lang," "not conforming to the crowd" is called "ning ci," "stirring up trouble" is called "shan yin huo," "unclean" is called "wo nang," "arrogant" is called "pin ma," "keeping secrets" is called "nie zhu," "destroying" is called "shi chang," and "beautiful" is called "liao bao bao." In the poem "Jiao ren liao xi," the commentary explains that "liao" means "good," which is also an ancient Zhou and Qin pronunciation.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Jiangxi Remnant Bandits Can Be Quickly Eliminated <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>—District Commanders Are Actively Searching and Suppressing—</p>
<p>Nanchang dispatch: Last year, when the bandit leaders Zhu De and Mao Zedong led their main force of the false central army to flee far into Sichuan, Hunan, Guangxi, and Guizhou, they left the bandit leaders Ye Jianying and Chen Yi to collect the remnants in southern Jiangxi, attempting a final struggle. Currently, the newly recovered districts have been divided into areas by the pacification office to establish Pacification Commanders, responsible for searching and suppressing remnant bandits, attracting back refugees, providing disaster relief, restoring order, and organizing self-defense, with the aim of achieving stability. Remnant bandits in the hinterland of Jiangxi Province have been largely eliminated, and highways and Baojia systems have been completed successively. However, the factions led by Ye Jianying in the Huichang and Yudu areas, and Chen Yi in the Yongfeng, Jishui, and Wujiang areas, are still fleeing east and west. Furthermore, the remaining evils of the Fang bandits in northeastern Jiangxi and the borders of Fujian, Zhejiang, and Anhui, such as Shao Shiping and Zou Qi, and the bandits led by Cai Huiwen in the border areas of Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan, as well as small groups of scattered bandits in various places that had been deeply affected by banditry in the past, cannot be eradicated immediately. The pacification office has ordered the district commanders to continue to blockade, encircle, and search for them. Recently, local troops stationed there have been engaged in suppression and pacification, and have made every effort to set up blockades and pillboxes. These remnant bandits have lost their ability to rally support, but the bandits who are coerced and oppressed by the bandit leaders have no way to break free from their shackles to start anew. However, their complete elimination is only a matter of time. (26th)</p>
<h3 id="e91">Building a Dike at the Mouth of the Yellow River <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Preparations are complete, construction to begin on May 1st, the Yellow River-Grand Canal combined shipping to be realized this autumn</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Director of the Department of Construction, Zhang Honglie, led Zhao Weihan, head of the department's section, Secretary Wang Zhigang, Technician Shi Andong, and Hu Xueli from the Long-Distance Telephone Administration Office, departed from Jinan on the 20th of this month to inspect the diligence of government officials in northern Shandong, convene the Public Security Bureau's Lian Zhuang Hui for roll call and instruction, and inspect the achievements of the fourth and fifth departments, long-distance telephone and tree planting, etc. After passing through fifteen counties including Lijin, Zhanhua, Wudi, Yangxin, Huimin, Shanghe, Linyi, Yucheng, Gaotang, Boping, Liaocheng, Linqing, Xialü, Enxian, and Pingyuan, on the evening of the 26th, they returned to Jinan by special train. According to Zhang, "I first went to Lijin to see the Yellow River silted wasteland. In addition to the designated reclamation area that can accommodate 7,000 disaster victims, a section was also designated in Machang that can accommodate 200 people. The disaster victims in western Shandong have all arrived in the reclamation area and have been properly settled. Each person lives in a shack, and land has been allocated, 50 mu per person. They are now engaged in reclamation. The Yellow River silted land is all fertile farmland, but the lack of rain this spring is quite dry. From Lijin to Haikou, there are about 200 li. I inspected the area 130 or 140 li from Lijin. In the first half of the section, I often saw the small houses of the original reclamation residents, because the former reclamation residents went home after the harvest and did not live here, so the houses were simply built and could only last for a year. The second half of the section was uninhabited because it was far from Haikou and difficult to travel. If I went further down, it would take four or five days to return, so I did not go to Haikou to save time. As for the problem of building a dike at the mouth of the river and blocking the Luan Jing Zi branch ditch, the people of Lijin County shirked responsibility to the disaster victims who moved there for reclamation, and the construction was delayed. Now it has been completely resolved. Lijin allocates labor to cooperate with the disaster victims, and the disaster victims are responsible for more, and the people of Lijin County are responsible for less, in order to complete it. The materials have been prepared, and construction will begin uniformly on May 1st. The measurement team previously sent by the Department of Construction and the River Affairs Bureau measured Haikou, starting from Lijin across the river and measuring from Zhanhua on the south bank. Now it has been completed in most cases. The dike construction project requires a total of 300,000 square feet of labor. 20,000 yuan of construction funds have been allocated. Those who are responsible for building the dike are given a subsidy of 2 jiao per cubic foot of earth. After the Yellow River project Guan Tai blocked the mouth, the silt was not greatly affected, so the river level was stable. After I finished inspecting northern Shandong, I went west and inspected the Grand Canal when I passed Liaocheng and Linqing. The Northern Canal navigation plan has long been completed, requiring a total of 370,000 yuan of construction funds. The central government has agreed to allocate 260,000 yuan. In the next two months, 80,000 yuan can be received first. After receiving it, we will first start with important places. The combined shipping of the Yellow River and the Grand Canal can be realized in July or August of this year. The section from Linqing to Tianjin can still be navigable, but the water volume is too small, and only the smallest boats can travel back and forth. The water volume of the Grand Canal must be increased before larger boats can pass, which will facilitate merchants. The general situation of the counties I inspected this time is very good. Each county has planted many trees this spring. The Huimin Automobile Road has planted 40 or 50 li of new roadside trees this year, which are willow trees and have all survived. They are all trimmed neatly. There is a section of Qingping's flower arrangement land between Gaotang and Boping, which is 12 li long. The poplar trees planted last year and the year before last have all survived and are now 3 feet high and very neat and lush. The Lian Zhuang Hui in Yucheng trained for 70 days, and the results were very good. The Lian Zhuang Hui in Pingyuan, which has only been training for 40 days, is in even better condition. The county's Public Security Bureau is also very good. The inspection situation in each county passed on this trip will be made into a general report for comparison, etc. (27th)</p>
<h3 id="e92">An Overview of the Implementation of the Guide-Huai Project <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Divided into several items such as dredging, building dikes, and building gates</p>
<p>Beijing News: The purpose of the Guide-Huai Plan is to prevent floods, facilitate shipping, promote irrigation, eliminate harm, and promote benefits, while considering both. All the plans have been studied and stipulated in detail, and have been submitted to the National Government for approval. In recent years, the Guide-Huai Committee has implemented the most urgent and effective projects within its financial capacity. The following is a brief description of the projects that have been built and are underway.</p>
<p>(1) Preliminary Dredging Project of the Zhangfu River: The Zhangfu River is the first section of the sea-bound waterway in the flood discharge project, and it is also the main channel for diverting water from the Huai River to the Grand Canal in the irrigation and shipping projects. It starts from Gaoliangjian at the mouth of Hongze Lake and ends at Matouzhen, the entrance to the canal, with a total length of about 31 kilometers. It has been in disrepair for many years, and the siltation is increasing day by day. The Guide-Huai Committee started construction in January of the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), widening and deepening the original river channel. It was completed in July, requiring a total of more than 470,000 yuan. After the completion of the project, shipping, which used to be dry and shallow, is now smooth and unobstructed. In addition, last year, various places suffered from severe drought, but the canal area relied entirely on the dredging of this river to provide abundant water. Because of this, the eastern part of the Jiangbei Canal was greatly irrigated. On the 14th of this month, the members of the Guide-Huai Committee went to Huaiyin to inspect the ship lock project and took a boat through the Zhangchen River to visit the Honghu Dam. They inspected along the river and saw that the river surface was wide, and the water depth was sufficient. The Huai River from the upper reaches discharged from Hongze Lake, passing through the lower reaches of the river and coming directly to the canal, with a very smooth flow. This is enough to prove that the initial Guide-Huai project of the Guide-Huai Committee has been completed with limited costs and has achieved remarkable results.</p>
<p>(2) Building Shaobo, Huaiyin, and Liujian Ship Locks: The Grand Canal runs vertically through the north and south of Jiangsu Province, and it is an important channel for irrigation and navigation in the lower reaches of the Huai River. However, its water potential fluctuates with the seasons. When it is flooded, it overflows, and when it is dry, it dries up. Although there is a canal, it cannot be used to its full extent. To maximize the use of the canal, its water level must be maintained at a considerable height, with little change throughout the winter and summer. Major ships can pass smoothly all year round, and the counties in eastern Shandong can also benefit from irrigation. In the middle of the canal, there were many old stone gates, which were all built across the river, leaving a two-zhang wide opening for ships to pass through. Every time ships pass through the gate, they have to be dragged by a winch, which is dangerous and time-consuming. Moreover, the water flow through the gate is often continuous day and night, with no way to regulate the discharge. The Guide-Huai Committee, in order to improve the current situation of the canal, established three ship lock engineering bureaus in Shaobo, Huaiyin, and Liurun in the 23rd year of the Republic (1934) and built a new-style ship lock in each place. The lock chamber of the ship lock is 100 meters long and 10 meters wide, and its capacity is enough to allow one 900-ton ship or ten 40-ton ships to pass through the lock at one time. The gate is made of steel, and the lock wall is made of steel-reinforced concrete. Both sides of the lock chamber are paved with stone blocks and built as slopes. There are also water pipes placed on both sides of the bottom of the lock chamber, connecting the upper and lower gates, and there are opening and closing machines on both sides of the gate, which are very convenient to use. The maximum water level difference between the upstream and downstream of the gate is 7.7 meters at the Shaobo Gate and 9.2 meters at the Huaiyin and Liujian Gates. The cost of each ship lock, including materials, is about 600,000 yuan. In order to facilitate construction and not interfere with the current traffic on the canal, they are all built on the land of the river bay, and diversion canals are dug to connect the canal, and then the foundation piling project is implemented. To date, the diversion canals in the three places have been completed. The large and small piles and steel sheet piles of the lower foundation of the water channel on both sides of the upstream and downstream of the Shaobo and Huaiyin gates have also been completed. They are now rushing to assemble the steel bars and engage in concrete work, working day and night. It is expected that the work can be completed by the end of June this year. As for the Liujian Ship Lock, the foundation piling project is being actively carried out, and it will also be completed in August of this year. After the completion of the three gates, the water potential of the canal can be maintained at a considerable depth throughout the year. From Sanjiangying in the Yangtze River, along the canal to the Yunhe Station north of the intersection of the Longhai Railway, a total of 350 kilometers, ships with a draft of 2 meters and a load of 900 tons can pass unobstructed. The important towns along the way, such as Shaobo, Gaoyou, Bao Ying, Huai'an, Huaiyin, and Suqian, are all prosperous areas in northern Jiangsu. The development of transportation in the future can be predicted.</p>
<p>(3) Organizing the East and West Banks of the Grand Canal: The east bank of the Grand Canal has been in disrepair for many years, and now the Jiangsu Provincial Grand Canal Engineering Bureau is raising and thickening it, dismantling the old sweep, or paving stone work to protect it. There are more than 20 culvert breaches on the west bank, which must be repaired separately or fitted with cave doors to maintain the water level of the Grand Canal and manipulate the water flow. The project is handled by the Shaobo Ship Lock Engineering Bureau of the Guide-Huai Committee. Three engineering offices are set up in Bao Ying Gaoyou Zhaoguan Dam to start construction at the same time on the entire line. Some have been completed, and some are being filled and repaired. It is expected that they can be completed before June.</p>
<p>(4) Building the Gaoyou Small Ship Lock: The Gaoyou Yuehe Port on the west bank of the Grand Canal is an important channel for ships in Gaobao Lake to enter the Grand Canal. The Guide-Huai Committee plans to build a small ship lock there to facilitate transportation. The port will be closed after the construction of the small ship lock begins. It is currently being prepared and will begin construction soon.</p>
<p>(5) Repairing the Huiji Dam: The Huiji Dam in Matouzhen of the Grand Canal is the outlet of the newly dredged Zhangfu River. It is urgent to rebuild and install active gates to manipulate the irrigation water volume and navigation water level in the canal. The Guide-Huai Committee has prepared the project and will start construction immediately.</p>
<p>(6) Building the Sanhe Active Dam: Hongze Lake has the function of absorbing and discharging the Huai River, but the method of controlling the water volume has only been to build a temporary grass dam in Jiangba. This grass dam is used to bind reeds into a sweep on the lakeside to resist lake waves, and then add soil to prevent leakage. For the convenience of closure, the dam is only repaired and blocked when the Hongze Lake water level is too low. However, the grass dam is light, and it is washed away when the water rises the following spring. It cannot be controlled according to the season. If the Huai flood rises, the lake water overflows the embankment, and the obstruction of the dam base and dam head to the water flow prevents the lake water from being discharged smoothly. The Guide-Huai Committee therefore plans to build a new-style active dam with a total length of 60 holes, each 10 meters wide and 5.5 meters high. The foundation and piers are all built with concrete, and the doors are made of steel, each of which can move freely and open and close freely, requiring about 3.5 million yuan in construction costs. The dam is built on the land south of the Sanhekou, and diversion canals are dug to connect Hongze Lake and the Sanhe River. The project of excavating the diversion canals has been tendered this spring, requiring a price of more than 1.7 million yuan. The Guide-Huai Committee has set up a Sanhe Active Dam Engineering Bureau there and has started construction. After the success of the dam, the lake water can be pre-discharged during floods to wait for the accumulation of floodwater, and the lake water can be pre-regulated during droughts to provide irrigation and navigation water sources. Large ships with a draft of 2 meters can enter Sanjiangying from the Yangtze River, pass through the Shaobo and Huaiyin ship locks, exit the Zhangfu River and pass through Hongze Lake, and reach Bengbu and Huaiyuan in the west. In peacetime, the lake water can be blocked, so that it can enter the sea waterway through the Zhangfu River and return to the sea, so that the sea waterway can be scoured for a long time and become deeper day by day. Therefore, the active dam is the main key to the separation of the river and the sea and the irrigation and navigation plan, and it cannot be delayed. It is expected that it will be completed in two years.</p>
<p>(7) Building the Yangzhuang Active Dam: The Guide-Huai Plan has decided on the principle of separating the river and the sea. There is already a project to build a Sanhe Active Dam at the Sanhekou of the Jiang River waterway to regulate discharge, and it has also been decided to build an active dam at Yangzhuang on the sea waterway. Its effect is the same as that of the Sanhe Active Dam. It is currently being planned and prepared, and it can be tendered next month.</p>
<p>(8) Building the Yankou Ship Lock: The Yankou River is an important channel for connecting Huaihai traffic. However, there is no direct navigation between the Yankou River and the Grand Canal. Goods coming from the Yankou River must first be discharged at the West Dam and transferred to boats, barged for more than ten miles through the abandoned Yellow River, and then transferred to boats again to reach the Grand Canal, which is very inconvenient. The Guide-Huai Committee plans to build a new-style ship lock near Yangzhuang to allow direct navigation between the Yankou and Grand Canal. As for the design of the ship lock, it is similar to the one built in Huaiyin. As soon as the Huaiyin Ship Lock is completed, it can be continued.</p>
<p>(9) Building the Liulaojian Water Discharge Gate: The Yi River contains a lot of sediment, and it detours through the Middle Grand Canal, carrying sediment south, which is very harmful to the downstream. In order to prevent and block it, the Guide-Huai Committee has built a ship lock at Liulaojian to block its muddy water from going south. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has also completed the reorganization of the Liutang River, the main channel for the Yi River to return to the sea. Therefore, the construction of a new water discharge gate between the Liutang River and the Grand Canal is necessary. According to Liulaojian, there used to be a nine-hole gate for discharging Yi River into Liutang River. Later, it was changed to a rolling dam. After the dam collapsed, grass dams were used to start and block every year, but it still could not fully store and discharge water. It is now planned to build a new-style water discharge gate upstream of the Liurun Ship Lock, with a total length of 10 holes and a discharge capacity of 1,000 cubic meters. After the Liulaojian Ship Lock is completed, it will be started.</p>
<p>(10) Guide the Water into the Sea Project: The Huai River has only two outlets, the Jiang River and the sea. However, if all of it enters the Jiang River, the Jiang River may not be able to handle it. If all of it enters the sea, the construction cost is huge and does not conform to economic principles. After weighing the pros and cons and studying the gains and losses in detail, it was decided to adopt the principle of separating the Jiang and the sea. The sea waterway runs from Zhangfu River through the abandoned Yellow River to the Taizi entrance to enter the sea, with a total length of more than 170 kilometers. The project is huge and difficult. The Guide-Huai Committee negotiated with the Jiangsu Provincial Government and obtained the consent of the provincial government to handle the implementation of the project. Starting from Yangzhuang in the northwest of Huaiyin and ending at Taizi Port in the northeast of Funing, 160,000 workers were recruited to work at the construction site, taking advantage of the agricultural slack time from October to May of the following year to excavate earthwork. The entire project is expected to be completed in May of the 25th year of the Republic (1936).</p>
<h3 id="e93">Ministry of Railways Plan: Construction of the Zhendong Railway <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Abstract of the Survey Report</p>
<p>Zhenjiang News: Previously, people from Jiangsu Province suggested to the Ministry of Railways to construct a railway from Kouan to Dongtai (East Taizhou). The Ministry of Railways sent personnel to survey the area. The Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce, considering Kou-Dong Railway's isolated position, proposed the idea of constructing the Zhen-Dong Railway last month, requesting the Ministry of Railways to change the route. The ministry sent personnel to survey again, and the result was that a change was indeed necessary. They are now actively proceeding with it, hoping to realize it soon. The surveyor also drafted a survey report, divided into ten chapters: 1. General Discussion; 2. Comparison of Constructing the Kou-Dong Railway and the Zhen-Dong Railway; 3. The Topography and Economic Overview of the Lixiahe Region; 4. The Transportation Situation in the Lixiahe Region and a Comparison of Water and Land Transportation; 5. The Plan for the New Reclamation Area in the Lixiahe Region and its Relationship with the Railway; 6. The Situation of Salt Production in Huainan and its Relationship with the Railway; 7. The Route and Engineering Plan of the Zhen-Dong Railway; 8. The Arrangement of Zhenjiang Wharf and the Regulations on Ferry Fees; 9. Engineering Budget of the Zhen-Dong Railway and Forecast of Passenger and Freight Transportation and Operating Expenses; 10. Conclusion. The report is over 20,000 words long. An abstract is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>General Survey: People from Jiangsu Province, recognizing the importance of transportation in the Lixiahe region, proposed building the Kou-Dong Railway, starting from Kouan, passing through Taixian, to Dongtai, with a total length of 80 kilometers and a construction cost of 3 million yuan, predicting a surplus of over 500,000 yuan. Based on this survey, it is believed that the dense population and abundant agricultural products in the Lixiahe region necessitate the construction of a railway. Moreover, the construction of a railway is particularly important to promote the new reclamation area plan. However, the Kou-Dong route is isolated and difficult to develop in the future, and it will greatly affect the business of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. Therefore, while surveying the Kou-Dong route, a line from Zhenjiang to Taixian was surveyed separately, and the Zhen-Dong Railway plan was drafted for comparison. This line starts from Qihaokou on the opposite bank of Zhenjiang, passes through Jiangdu Xiannv Temple, Taixian, to Dongtai, with a length of 128 kilometers, an estimated construction cost of 4.53 million yuan, and can be completed in two years. The predicted income is 1,337,000 yuan, operating expenses are 572,800 yuan, interest is 162,000 yuan, and the surplus is about 402,200 yuan. With this plan, it can connect with the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, cultivate each other, and prosper Zhenjiang and Jiangdu. If, after the completion of the entire line, it is extended northward from Dongtai to Yancheng or Daning, the business will undoubtedly see development.</p>
<p>Comparison of the Two Routes: Northern Jiangsu, east from the East China Sea and west to the Grand Canal, north to the Yellow River diversion area, and south to the Yangtze River, including Funing, Yancheng, Dongtai, Taixian, and Xinghua counties, is collectively called Lixiahe. Because transportation on the east, west, and north sides is inconvenient, the three ports along the Yangtze River, Huojiaqiao, Kouan, and Tianshenggang, serve as its gateways. All Yangtze River steamships stop here for connection. The route from Tianshenggang to Dongtai is the Tongyu Railway. There is no need to discuss this line further. Huojiaqiao is located in Jiangdu, with the same position as Qihaokou. The comparison between the Kou-Dong and Zhen-Dong railways is as follows: (1) The Kou-Dong Railway is only 80 kilometers long. Its southern end from Kouan to Danyang is 50 kilometers, and its northern end from Dongtai to Haizhou is 270 kilometers. The route itself is very short and isolated. It is better to change the route through Jiangdu to Qihaokou on the opposite bank of Zhenjiang, connecting with the Beijing-Shanghai Railway across the river and serving as a cultivating line for Beijing-Shanghai. (2) Zhenjiang is the capital of Jiangsu Province and a major port on the Yangtze River. The Jiangbei Railway should connect here, which can benefit from commercial transportation and achieve military and political control. Therefore, the Kou-Dong route should be abandoned in favor of the Zhen-Dong route. (3) The Beijing-Shanghai Railway connects to Jinpu in the north, Jingwu in the south, and Huhangyonghangjiang and other lines in the east, stretching for thousands of miles. Although the Zhen-Dong Railway is on the opposite bank, it can connect with the existing railways and avoid the isolated position of the Kou-Dong Railway. (4) If the Zhen-Dong Railway extends westward from Jiangdu, passing through Yiwei, Liuhe, to Pukou, it will connect with the Jinpu Railway. It can connect with various routes in North China and use the capital's ferry to connect with various routes in Jiangnan. Although the Jiangdu-Pukou line is parallel to the Yangtze River, it is quite important militarily and there is a possibility of construction in the future. (5) Jiangdu is a major city in Jiangbei, located at the mouth of the Grand Canal into the Yangtze River. The Customs used to consider its location superior, but since the construction of the Jinpu Railway, commerce has declined. If the Kou-Dong Railway is built, Zhenjiang and Jiangdu will decline further. Therefore, changing the railway route, passing through Jiangdu to Qihaokou, not only restores the prosperity of Zhenjiang and Jiangdu, but also uses the existing prosperity of the two ports to assist the railway's business. (6) Currently, much of the transportation in Lixiahe passes through Zhenjiang, transferring to the Beijing-Shanghai Railway to reach various ports. If the Kou-Dong Railway is built, the connection between Kouan and other ports will rely on water transportation, which will take away the original business of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. Therefore, it is proposed to change the route to the north bank of Zhenjiang and absorb water transportation.</p>
<p>Zhen-Dong Route: The Zhen-Dong railway line is planned to start from Qihaokou on the opposite bank of Zhenjiang, where a ferry pier will be built for docking. The station facilities will be simple. From here, the route goes north to Jiangdu Station in the southeast of Jiangdu City. The southeast sides of Jiangdu County are adjacent to the Grand Canal, and the ferry terminals are all outside Fuyun Gate. Crossing the ferry south from Fuyun Gate is the terminal of the Zhenyang Automobile Company. About half a mile to the west, a railway bridge is currently under construction and will be completed soon. In the future, railway passengers can enter the city via this bridge. After the railway leaves Jiangdu Station, it goes northeast and then east, passing through Wanfu Bridge (457 meters), Shiyanggou Bridge (181 meters), Dongjia Bridge (818 meters), and Qizha Bridge (approximately 67 meters), a total of five bridges to Xiannv Temple. The total length of the five bridges is 833 meters. Except for the Shiyanggou Bridge, where the clearance from the water surface should be 9 meters for navigation, the remaining bridges are not navigable. If the section is changed to pass through Yanjiaqiao and Xiaobaidu, only two bridges need to be built, with a total length of 753 meters, but Yanjiaqiao must be raised to facilitate navigation. These two lines should be carefully compared in the future for selection. After the route leaves Xiannv Temple, it follows the banks of the Tongyang Canal, passing through Yiling to Taixian City. The prosperous commercial area and ferry terminals of Taixian are all located in the north of the city. The terminals are divided into Shangheba and Xiaheba. All steamships docking upstream from Taixian to the Yangtze River use the Shanghe terminal, and all steamships docking downstream from Taixian to Dongtai and Xinghua use the Xiahe terminal. Shanghe and Xiahe can originally communicate with each other, but because the waterway passes through the city, it has gradually been silted up by residents, and over time, they have become isolated. Therefore, passenger and freight transport must be transferred at this dam. This is a major obstacle to transportation in Lixiahe. Due to the terrain, the railway station is located in the city. The route crosses the Tongyang Canal in Taixian, going east along its north bank, passing through Jiangyan and then turning north, passing through Liujiadun, Zhoujiashe, to Jiajialou in Shihuai East. Although this section of the route is slightly longer than the line going southeast from Taixian, passing through Lijiapu, Xiazhushe, Shujiashe, to Jiajialou, its terrain is higher and it passes through the large towns of Jiangyan and Shiyan, which are its advantages and can be compared in the future. After the route leaves Jijialou, it goes north-eastward along the east bank of the Yanyun Canal, directly to the south of Dongtai County, where Dongtai Station will be built. If it is planned to extend to Yancheng in the future, it can be extended northward from here.</p>
<p>Passenger and Freight Transportation: The Zhen-Dong route does not connect with the existing railways. If narrow-gauge railways are built to save costs, it is also possible. However, for future development, a broad-gauge plan is tentatively proposed, with a construction cost of 4.53 million yuan. The prediction of passenger and freight transportation is extremely difficult. Based on the current water transportation situation, it is estimated that the railway passenger transport can reach approximately 89,000,000 passenger-kilometers. The current ticket price for Zhenyang automobiles is one yuan per passenger, and two jiao per passenger is sufficient if the railway is available. Assuming that 6,220,000 passenger-kilometers can be obtained throughout the year, the total is 95,120,000 kilometers. Among this total, assuming that one-third are fourth-class passengers, calculated at 6 li per person per kilometer, the fare income would be 190,000 yuan. Two-thirds are third-class passengers, calculated at 1 fen per person per kilometer, the fare income would be 634,000 yuan. The total passenger ticket income is approximately 824,000 yuan. Freight transport is estimated to be approximately 61,870,000 ton-kilometers for the entire route, calculated at 8 li 3 hao per ton per kilometer, which would yield 513,000 yuan. The total annual income from passenger and freight transport is 1,337,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Survey Conclusion: The economic situation and engineering overview of the Zhen-Dong Railway have been described above. However, due to the rushed survey, it is not entirely accurate, which is a concern. Moreover, this survey did not carry instruments for terrain measurement because the area is flat and has no mountains. Furthermore, the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department has 10,000 copies of measured maps for design, which are more than accurate enough. Although the two items of passenger and freight income and operating expenses are not guaranteed to match the actual situation, they are analyzed item by item so that auditors have a basis for supplementing and revising them, and it is not difficult to obtain accurate results. If this transportation forecast is not inconsistent with future operating income, the railway's own economy, in addition to paying interest, can still repay 400,000 yuan per year. Even if the estimated amount exceeds the actual start of traffic and fails to repay the debt according to the amount, the government still has a necessity to construct the railway for the sake of transportation in Lixiahe and the development of the region's economy. Moreover, the construction of this route is actually a cultivating line for the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. It is estimated that the Beijing-Shanghai Railway can increase passenger transport by 158,000,000 passenger-kilometers and freight transport by 66,000,000 ton-kilometers per year. The combined income of these two items is no less than one million yuan. Therefore, the construction of the Zhen-Dong Railway, although its own benefits are small, its benefits to society and the cultivation of Beijing-Shanghai's business are great.</p>
<h3 id="e94">National Woodcut Exhibition Opens in Jinan <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>—Over a Thousand Works—</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Jin Zhaoye and others collected woodcut works from all over the country and reference materials from China and abroad, and held a national woodcut exhibition at the YMCA in Jinan. The opening was held today (the 27th). Many people from the art and literature circles visited. The exhibition room is divided into three parts: (1) Modern woodcut works, the largest in number; (2) Ancient woodcut works, including Japanese works and versions, etc., with Ming Dynasty and Qing Dynasty Tongzhi Daoguang versions, paintings of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Jin Ping Mei, etc.; (3) New Year pictures, also collected in large quantities, allowing a comparison of the past and present. The woodcut knives made by Wang Mazi Iron Shop in Beijing have contributed greatly to the art of woodcut in recent years. The association also has a set on public display. Among the works, Li Hua's "Galloping Horse" is swift and vigorous, with the spirit of a horse neighing in the wind, and Luo Qingzhen's "Landscape" is meticulous and elegant. Gu Gan's "Night of September 18th" depicts the scene of Shenyang city in the hazy night, with fires illuminating the sky, and the military and civilians fleeing in panic. The sound of cannons and cries can be heard. Although it is a moment of extreme chaos, it is vividly depicted. Liu Yan's "Girl" and "Landscape" are lifelike and very poetic. The most poetic is Zhang Hui's "The Moon is Full, but the Person is Not," depicting a woman leaning on a railing outside a small pavilion, her sleeves cold, looking at the moon with sorrow. Wang Shaoluo's "The Moon Rises on the Willow Branch" depicts a desolate moonlight scene, similar to the previous picture, with willows swaying and a person standing alone in an empty courtyard, admiring his own shadow, just at the time of a rendezvous after dusk. The number of works is about a thousand. (27th)</p>
<h3 id="e95">Songjiang: Wage Dispute Among River Dredging Workers <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The county is dredging the city moat. The first section has been inspected and accepted by the Provincial Committee in Songjiang. The fifth section, from Waiguan驿 outside the West Gate to Baojia Bridge, has already started construction. The project is contracted by Cao Xinquan from Ningbo. Pan Binglin from Tiantai, Zhejiang, sub-contracted a part of the work from Cao. There were 55 workers. After Pan received the wages from Cao, he did not distribute them to the workers. Because of the wage dispute, the workers went on strike. Fearing that it would affect the entire project, Cao urgently sought a solution, paid off the wages, including the four days of the strike. After deducting what Pan had already received, he found more than 70 yuan and declared dismissal. Twenty of the workers were still willing to work with Cao in Songjiang, but they could not get anything from Pan and turned to Cao for payment. Cao was dragged out of his residence in the Xilin Temple by the workers. Zheng Daquan, a jailer from the county, was from the same hometown as Pan and also negotiated on behalf of the workers. When the crowd passed through the street, the citizens almost thought they had caught an escaped prisoner. Then they went to Wu Zhidao of China-England Pharmacy, Cao's guarantor, but could not find a solution. They went to the district office, where acting district chief Lu mediated and explained that Cao had already paid off the wages and the workers should seek repayment from Pan. He also explained to the jailer Zheng that Ningbo and Tiantai were both from Zhejiang and there was no difference between them, and persuaded them to be kind. However, Cao, the foreman, felt that he had been insulted for no reason and asked the district office to uphold justice. It is unknown how the matter will be resolved.</p>

<p>The local silkworm seed industry association held a meeting of members yesterday. Representatives from 14 seed fields attended, chaired by Jiang Jiayou. The following important matters were resolved: 1. The spring silkworm industry this year suffered from many malpractices due to the improper control methods of the province. Seed sellers raised seed prices, harming the rearing households. It was decided to request the Jiangsu Provincial Sericulture Improvement Management Committee to make use of the baojia system during the autumn silkworm season to investigate the required number of silkworm seeds from the township heads in advance, and then distribute them to the rearing households, so as to avoid the temporary shortage or surplus. 2. It was requested that the Provincial Sericulture Improvement Association increase the price of autumn seeds by one jiao per sheet. 3. The term of office of the current executive and supervisory committee members has expired. It should be requested that the county party department send personnel to guide the re-election. In addition, the spring silkworms have been harvested in the past two days. The market price of mulberry leaves is two yuan per dan.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Teahouse Gambling Villagers Injure Police and Snatch Criminals <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The second branch of the Houqiao Public Security Bureau in this county, patrol officer Ma Zemin, received a report the other day that there was a gambling situation in Shengjiaqiao Pu Yinquan Teahouse in the jurisdiction. He immediately sent a police officer to arrest eight gamblers and gambling equipment. Just as he was about to take them to the bureau, villagers suddenly gathered and beat the police officer, snatching six gamblers. Police officer Xu Nianfeng was injured and lost a six-round revolver with five bullets, and a wooden-cased pistol with five bullets. Because they were outnumbered, the police only managed to arrest Pu Jisheng and Pu Zhongyi, two gamblers. After bringing them back to the station, they were taken to the county public security bureau together with the injured policeman. After Zhang, a clerk, opened the court for interrogation, he ordered the injured policeman to submit himself to the court for injury verification, and to detain the gambling criminals Pu Jisheng and Pu Zhongyi. It was scheduled to transfer them to the local branch court today for trial.</p>

<p>Chen Jingxin, director of the local donation collection office in this county, collected donations for the relief home from various fish shops based on the donation for yellow croakers, etc. The fish industry association had submitted a request to the provincial department for exemption. The finance department previously reported to the county government that this case involved trivial matters and was not suitable for inclusion, ordering the county to comply with the record. County Magistrate Yan believed that the fish donation had been submitted to the 22nd-year budget and instructed by the provincial government that this fish donation subsidy should be changed to a fish industry charity subsidy and collected according to the number. Yesterday (27th), he ordered the local donation collection office to collect and remit the number according to regulations.</p>

<p>Dasheng No. 3 Factory in this county was founded by Zhang Qian and has been operating prosperously since its opening, with annual surpluses and excellent results. It is a well-known textile factory in China. However, in recent years, due to sluggish market conditions and stagnant sales, it has been losing more than 10,000 yuan per month. If remedies are not sought urgently, it will be difficult to sustain. Therefore, a factory affairs meeting was held yesterday to decide on a complete contraction, laying off redundant staff, saving materials, and reducing more than 40 unnecessary expenses. If the market still shows no signs of improvement, the first step of contraction will be carried out.</p>

<p>This county suffered from a prolonged drought last year, and the autumn harvest was sharply reduced. Now, at the time of year when crops have been depleted and next harvest is not yet in, food is in short supply, and people are unusually panicked. Fortunately, the disaster relief committee raised disaster relief funds, purchased taro silk, and held low-priced sales, which helped to maintain the livelihood of the poor. The other day, the committee entrusted a Shanghai merchant, Fang, to purchase 2,400 dans of taro silk and transport it to Haimen. However, when it reached the Nandiangang River surface, it suddenly encountered a strong wind and capsized instantly. The five crew members and the taro silk, etc., all sank into the river and could not be salvaged, resulting in a huge loss.</p>

<p>Due to the eradication of sea bandits, a large number of fishing boats went to sea in Jiangbei's coastal areas of Lvsi, Fengli, and Jugang. In the past half month, the fish catches at each port have reached 800,000 yuan. However, the purchasing power of the people during the spring famine is weak, and fish prices are unusually low, with selling prices only half of what they were in previous years.</p>

<p>Huang Xikun, a clerk at the Hangzhou Sanyuanfang China Bank, was in his thirties and from Xiaoshan. He had been working at the bank for many years. At 7:00 AM on the 27th, he was carrying more than 7,000 yuan in cash to deliver and receive remittances to various households. Among them was Qian from Shanghai Yipinxing Cai Restaurant, who remitted 140 yuan to Qian's residence at No. 46 Shangcang Bridge. When Huang delivered the money according to the house number, he did not expect that several bandits were lying in ambush in the residence. They rushed out, killed Huang, robbed him of more than 5,000 yuan in cash, and fled. After waiting for Huang for a long time without him returning, the China Bank sent someone to search everywhere in the afternoon but could not find him. This morning (28th), another clerk went to the vicinity of Shangcang Bridge to deliver money and saw a China Bank bicycle parked at the entrance of No. 46. He recognized it as Huang's and went inside to check. He saw that there was no one in the room, but he found Huang Xikun's body lying in a pool of blood. He had a knife wound on his neck and three wounds on his chest. The scene was very tragic. He immediately reported to the China Bank authorities and then reported to the Public Security Bureau to investigate and arrest the murderer in order to solve the case.</p>

<p>Many Loan Extensions to Securely Get Through the End of the Fourth Month: Factory Representatives Visit Kong Today to Request Loans, according to Xinxin News Agency. Various domestic goods factories and firms in the city are suffering from the effects of monetary tightening, dumping of foreign goods, and the decline of the rural economy, resulting in a sharp reduction in purchasing power, which has led to sluggish business, stockpiling of inventory, and difficulties in capital circulation. Therefore, smaller factories and firms are in a precarious situation. At the same time, the four-month settlement period for long-term loans in the money industry has arrived. They are all striving to find ways to cope with the difficulties. Fortunately, major banks are providing mortgage loans, and money shops are expanding credit loans as much as possible, and are striving to provide assistance and relief. The term of various loans at the end of the fourth month, on average, 70 to 80 percent were extended or repaid in installments. Therefore, there is no problem with the difficulty at the end of the fourth month.

<h3 id="e111">Provisional Measures Agreed Upon Before the Sino-French Vietnam Trade Treaty is Signed: Overseas Chinese Negotiate with Customs Authorities <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, the Sino-French Vietnam Trade Treaty had already been in the process of being drafted during Wang Zhengting's tenure as Foreign Minister. The main treaty had been agreed upon at that time, with only a minor issue on the supplementary treaty causing delays until now, preventing its implementation. When French Minister Mr. Chapon-Baissac returned to China to resume his post, it was once widely rumored that the treaty could be actively concluded. However, there has been no news of any new progress in diplomatic negotiations to date. The Xin Sheng News Agency reporter learned from overseas Chinese affairs circles yesterday that overseas Chinese in Vietnam are subject to various restrictions in their commercial activities due to the lack of treaty protection. For example, the import duty levied by the Vietnamese customs on the same type of Chinese goods can vary arbitrarily from one dollar today to ten dollars tomorrow, with no set standards. This deters many overseas Chinese merchants from engaging in the trade of domestic goods, which has a significant impact on the export of Chinese products. In contrast, goods from other countries that have trade agreements with Vietnam, especially Japanese goods, are continuously imported into Vietnam, threatening the survival of Chinese businesses. Therefore, leading overseas Chinese figures such as Yan Zijun and Chen Liju recently negotiated with the Vietnamese customs authorities in their private capacities and agreed upon a provisional solution to be implemented before the official signing and implementation of the Sino-French Vietnam Trade Treaty. The solution involves the overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce submitting a list of commonly traded Chinese goods, and the Vietnamese customs will then specify the applicable tax rates for each item on the list and notify the overseas Chinese. However, this is a temporary arrangement, and the customs authorities reserve the right to change the tax rates at any time, provided that the overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce is notified one week before the change, who will then inform the respective overseas Chinese merchants. It is reported that this provisional measure is now in effect.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Overseas Chinese Federation: Measures to Boycott Siamese Rice <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, it was resolved to take unified action by contacting major ports. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce is requested to convene a meeting on a specific date. According to the Shiye News Agency, the harsh regulations on overseas Chinese education and the restrictions on overseas Chinese industrial and commercial activities promulgated by Siam have aroused deep resentment among the Chinese people. Outraged by this injustice, the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Federation, in addition to making every effort to assist the three million overseas Chinese in Siam, convened an emergency meeting of the fifth organizing committee at its headquarters at 3:30 PM yesterday to discuss ways to unite relevant organizations across the country and plan a large-scale boycott of Siamese rice imports. The committee members present included Guo Shun, Wu Yingpei, Wu Jishun, Xie Denan, and Huang Jianzhong. Guo Shun chaired the meeting, and Chen Luqin recorded the proceedings. After the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, the committee members expressed their opinions and discussed the proposals. (1) How to deal with the Siamese authorities' oppression of overseas Chinese? It was resolved to strongly support them. (2) Should there be unified communication with relevant organizations in other ports to implement the boycott of Siamese rice? It was resolved to send letters to the chambers of commerce and rice merchants' associations in the major ports where Siamese rice is sold in China, such as Guangzhou, Xiamen, Hong Kong, Shantou, and Shanghai, to seek unified action. (3) How to seek support from relevant organizations in this city for the boycott of Siamese rice? It was resolved to request the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Rice Merchants' Association, and other trade associations to hold a formal meeting on a specific date to discuss assistance measures. (4) Boycotting Siamese rice is a major undertaking, and effective measures should be discussed to achieve significant results. It was resolved that each committee member would be responsible for careful research. The meeting adjourned around 6:00 PM.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, Huang Shaoxiong, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, arrived in Shanghai by car from the Hangzhou highway the day before yesterday to visit his sick wife. He is scheduled to return to Hangzhou within a day or two. He met with reporters from various newspapers yesterday morning and made the following remarks:</p>
<p>Zhejiang's Finances According to Huang, Zhejiang's finances are currently quite difficult. In the last six months, there has been a deficit of about 2.8 million yuan. Zhejiang has successively provided advances, especially during the Fujian Incident. He hopes that these funds will be reimbursed as soon as possible to make up for the shortfall. As for the fundamental solution, Zhejiang's finances have always been based on income, and we will now focus on determining income and expenditure to achieve a balance.</p>
<p>Construction Plans There are currently no new construction plans in Zhejiang. The construction of the Qiantang River Railway Bridge is progressing smoothly. Last year, Zhejiang spent a total of over three million yuan on construction, most of which was used for water conservancy, agriculture, and roads. The rumor that the Ministry of Industry will jointly establish a silk factory in Zhejiang with the Zhejiang Provincial Government has not been discussed yet. However, the National Economic Council is paying close attention to the silk industry in Zhejiang.</p>
<p>County Magistrate Training Zhejiang recently held a training session for county magistrates, with only five counties absent, which is a good sign. As for the significance of holding this training session, it is to invite famous people to give lectures on the one hand, and to explain Zhejiang's administrative policies on the other hand, so that the counties have something to follow. I came here to visit my wife's illness.</p>
<p>Will return to Zhejiang in two days.</p>

<p>Implementing Labor Service: Improved Impression of Citizens</p>
<p>The Shanghai New Life Movement Youth Service Corps was ordered to take advantage of their spare time on the weekly holiday yesterday to carry out work. The main points of service were still to rectify the city's appearance and traffic order, while also focusing on the cleanliness of stations and docks. Yesterday, the Guomin News Agency dispatched reporters to inspect Pudong Xiani Ferry, Zhabei Qiujiang Road, Datong Road, Jiangwan, the North and South Stations, Zhenru Station, the Shiliupu Pier, and other places. They witnessed the enthusiastic work of the members, who cooperated with the police advisory team to provide services. The general boy scout members were particularly active on the streets, with some patrolling the streets, some helping the police on duty to direct traffic, and some directing vehicles outside the station gates. The various service situations were full of spirit. Some travelers who were new to Shanghai from the countryside saw members helping to maintain traffic and carrying goods on behalf of hired cars, and were even more grateful. Such labor service not only gives citizens a better impression of it, but also has a very effective effect on rectifying citizens.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning, the New Life Service Corps of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau Police Training Institute once again carried brooms and other items to work in the Rihui Bridge, Gaochang Temple, and Dapu Road areas. The corps was still divided into twenty-seven groups this time, totaling over three hundred people, spread throughout the area. The corps leader, Qiu Yuesong, who is also the educational director of the institute, personally went back and forth to direct the work. Each group's work was divided into two types, one for cleaning and one for publicity, which were carried out in rotation by the members of each group. This time, due to the previous experience, the effect was even greater. Not only were the streets and alleys very clean everywhere, but also the shops and residents largely accepted the corps' publicity and cleaned their shops inside and out. The corps also gently publicized to the general citizens who violated the new life, urging them to pay attention and correct themselves. Because the members of the corps acted gently, and everyone knew that they were sacrificing their holiday time to work, they were particularly admired.</p>

<p>Awang Nangye Khenpo from Tibet, Lhasa, practiced diligently from a young age and became proficient in the scriptures when he grew up. His scholarship and Taoism have always been respected by Tibetans. Later, he was selected by the Dalai Lama as the Geshe of the Serxu Temple in Tibet. Geshe is the Tibetan term for scholar. In the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932), he was ordered by the Dalai Lama to be appointed as the Khenpo of the Guangfa Temple in Maogong, Sichuan, to preach, explain the scriptures, and evangelize the local people. He established himself in Sichuan for three years. The generals in Sichuan who respected him most were Liu Wenhui and Xiang Yuren. During the conflict between the Han and Tibetan peoples in Jinsha River the year before last, Khenpo, based on the principle of compassion, strongly advocated peace and sent Luo Jiaming and others to Changdu and other places to mediate, which finally achieved a satisfactory result. This spring, Khenpo vowed to go south to visit Putuo and Lingyin Temples and tour Beijing and Shanghai along the way. Currently, Khenpo is being kept in Shanghai by his friends for a short stay and resides in Jing'an Villa. He is scheduled to return to Sichuan by ship in early next month.</p>

Starting from the 24th year, Qingpu, Fengxian, Wuxi, Jinshan, Songjiang, and other six counties will be ordered to follow suit. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Pan is currently discussing the matter with the Farmers Bank and the County Property Department to report to the Department of Finance for approval and implementation.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Telegrams Ministry of Transportation Requesting Cancellation of Simple Postal Package Fees <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Transportation in Nanjing: "To the Ministry of Transportation, Nanjing. It has been reported by the Jiangxi Ganxian Chinese Medicine Trade Association, Clothing Trade Association, Foreign Goods Trade Association, Dyeing Trade Association, and National Cloth Trade Association that the Gan County Post Office charges an additional simple fee for packages transferred from Ji'an and half an additional simple fee for packages transferred from Guangdong Nanxiong. Now that the highway is completed, transportation is convenient, and automobile transportation fees are decreasing rather than increasing, we have previously requested that you order the cancellation of the fees. We previously received Jiangxi Postal Administration No. 380 for registered mail, acknowledging receipt of the report. We have investigated and found that the Gan County Post Office charges an additional simple fee for packages going to and from various places transferred from Ji'an and half a simple fee for packages transferred from Guangdong Nanxiong because automobile transportation costs are high and they have to appropriately increase fees to make up for it. The proximity of Ji'an and Linchuan to places with railways and waterways varies, so they cannot be compared. Furthermore, the claim in the report that packages from Guangdong Province transferred through Nanxiong are not subject to fees is not true. We received this and investigated. In the past, due to the communist bandits' harassment and the blockade of the Gan River, packages from various places to Gan were transferred from Ji'an by rickshaw. Under these special circumstances, transportation costs increased, and the bureau charged the recipients an additional simple fee to handle the matter, which was not unreasonable. However, when transportation costs returned to normal, the additional fees should be cancelled, as the Postal Administration had previously approved. Now that the communist bandits have fled far away, sailing has returned to normal, and highway transportation is convenient, transportation costs are decreasing rather than increasing, which goes without saying. However, the Postal Administration and the Jiangxi Postal Administration did not order the Gan County Post Office to cancel the increased additional simple fee, but still allow them to charge an additional simple fee for packages transferred from Ji'an and half a simple fee for packages transferred from Nanxiong, claiming that automobile transportation costs are high and they have to appropriately increase fees to make up for it. If automobile transportation costs are high, the Postal Administration should calculate and collect fees from the sender once for all automobile-accessible counties, which would be reasonable. Now, highways have been successively completed throughout Jiangxi Province, and dozens of counties are accessible by automobile. No local post office has been heard of charging recipients additional simple fees, except for the Gan County Post Office, which is allowed to charge an additional simple fee for packages delivered to various places. Taking the Ji-Gan Road as an example, the Wan'an Suichuan Post Office does not need to charge additional simple fees for packages, even though Suichuan and Wan'an are only a little over a hundred li from Gan and are not accessible by railway. Within this hundred li distance, a simple fee must be added. In the same province and both using automobile transportation, the fees are so different, what could be more unfair? It can be seen that the reason for charging additional fees to make up for high automobile transportation costs is completely unfounded. Furthermore, the communist bandits have fled far away, and the Gan River is unobstructed. Sailboats and steamships come and go like shuttles, and transportation has returned to normal. Packages delivered from various places to Gan are sometimes transported by automobile, but most of them are transported by sailboats and steamships to Gan. However, the Gan Post Office still charges a uniform simple fee, which is close to extortion. Therefore, we hereby submit a written request for your examination and approval, and for your forwarding to the National Government, the Ministry of Transportation, and the Nanjing Postal Administration and the Jiangxi Postal Administration, ordering the Gan County Post Office to quickly cancel this additional simple fee to alleviate the difficulties of businesses and facilitate commerce. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce," etc. The matter was previously submitted by the Gan County Chamber of Commerce in December of last year, also by telegram, requesting your approval. No reply has been received yet. The reason for the additional simple fee for postal delivery in that area was due to the obstacles and difficulties in transportation caused by the chaos of the bandits. Therefore, when the bandit chaos is quelled and transportation is restored to normal, the simple fee should be exempted. This is a definite principle. Now, the post office in that area has suddenly changed its tune after the bandit chaos has been quelled, attributing it to the high cost of automobiles. If what they say is true, then the simple fee will become a permanent practice. If this is extrapolated, highways will gradually become widespread throughout the country, but why do they not all charge additional simple fees? This is sufficient to show that the reason given by the bureau is not well-founded. The construction of highways, in addition to facilitating military transportation, was originally intended to facilitate commercial transportation. If the bureau does what it does, the commercial highways will become an excuse to harm businesses, making it impossible to reduce transportation costs and make progress. The ministry should consider the overall situation and correct it. It is reasonable to telegram your bureau for examination and approval, and to order the bureau to cancel all additional simple fees, which would be fair and convenient. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce respectfully submits this."</p>

According to the association's rules, a quorum of 284 members was required, but the number of attendees did not meet the quorum. The meeting had to be changed to a talk session. (At this time, the party law representatives left the meeting.) Members were requested to discuss the proposals put forward by member Zhang Feixiong, such as (1) the proposal to reduce the regular meeting fee of the association; (2) the proposal to (a) appropriately reduce membership fees, (b) amend the rules on the quorum for meetings, (c) increase the number of Executive and Supervisory Committee members, and (d) amend the voting procedures. After more than ten members, including Jiang Yiping, Zhang Feixiong, and Shi Qinghua, expressed their opinions, the result was that the matter would be handled after being authorized by the Executive and Supervisory Committees. As for the proposal of the Executive and Supervisory Committees to build an association hall, the drawn plans for the association hall were mounted in three frames and displayed at the meeting for all attendees to visit and study. And the proposal of Song Shixiang, Jiao Dingen, Shi Qinghua and other ten members to request the association to organize a maintenance association for released prisoners, was not discussed at all.

<p>The Shanghai Association of Machine-Made National Products Factories, in order to promote national products, specially created national product samples and sent letters to all schools in the city yesterday, which read: "Respected sirs, the promotion of national products depends on recognition, so that buyers will not mistake deer for horses, and sellers will not dare to mix fakes with the genuine. Our association, in view of the dumping of foreign loans, the poverty of the people, and the weakness of the country, believes that a true and appropriate method of recognition is needed to promote them. Therefore, we have specially printed 100,000 copies of national product samples for the public to recognize. Although there are omissions, we have already distributed more than 90,000 copies to all sectors of society across the country. They are all regarded as a compass for buying national products. This year is Student National Products Year, and comrades from various schools have sworn to use national products in front of the municipal government. Our association will give all the remaining thousands of national product samples to the schools so that they can be used easily by referring to the pictures. Now we offer about ten copies and ask your school to distribute them to the students."</p>

Alas, Wu Pass and Yue Mountain, intermingled with famous people, washing the European and Su waters, with writing for thousands of years. The resounding sound, the lofty outline, in ancient times known as a child prodigy, without stubbornness or mediation. Over twenty years old, devoted to revolution, flying alone, a pioneer in navigation. The masses are weeping with sorrow. The devastation of the labor movement is unbearable. Suffering hardships and difficulties, even death is sweet. Entering with enthusiasm, like an eagle greedy for its arms. In broad daylight, disaster strikes. Clear terms and strict prisons, suffering for others. Breaking free from shackles, the sun and moon pass. Heroic spirit undiminished, advocating for the establishment of schools, benefiting the young, truly significant. Armed with art, with aspirations to strive. The compass of the trade union, coughing blood to heal. Change occurs suddenly, destroying our bright integrity, breaking our hearts. The altar is in front, the coffin at the door. May your spirit be present, may you accept our offering. Alas, enjoy!</p>
<h3 id="e130">Hai Zhou Merchant Ship Sinks Xin Yu Long Fishing Boat; Ningbo Association Sends Letter to Maritime Bureau Requesting Legal Action <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Shi Abao from Dinghai makes a living from fresh fish and owns a fresh fish boat named Xin Yu Long, employing ten crew members. On the 21st of this month, the fresh fish boat was hit by ice at Gao Qiao and sailed to the sea off Yushan to collect fresh fish. At 5:00 AM the next morning, as it approached the sea off Tongsha, a light fog filled the air. As dawn was approaching, the crew of the boat vaguely saw a giant wheel in the fog, not sounding its whistle, but sailing quickly towards them. The boat hurriedly steered to avoid it, but the giant wheel also steered in the direction the boat was trying to avoid, colliding with the hull, instantly cutting it in two. All ten crew members fell into the water and called for help. Although the people escaped, the boat sank and the losses were immeasurable. It was later learned that the giant wheel was the Haizhou merchant ship of the Hezhong Company. They attempted to negotiate to shirk responsibility. Yesterday, the boat owner Shi Abao sent a letter to the Ningbo Shanghai Compatriot Association and the Dinghai Shanghai Compatriot Association, requesting assistance. The two associations sent a special letter to the Maritime Bureau based on the situation, which read: "We are writing to inform you that our member Xuan Abao stated that he is engaged in fresh fish trade and owns a boat named Xin Yu Long. On the afternoon of the 22nd of this month, the boat was hit by ice at Gao Qiao and sailed to the sea off Yushan to collect fresh fish. The next morning (the 22nd), as it approached the sea off Tongsha, a light fog suddenly appeared. The driver instructed the crew to be extra careful. Unexpectedly, at 5:25 AM, as dawn was approaching, a giant wheel was vaguely seen in the fog sailing straight towards the boat. The boat, fearing an accident, and with a southeast wind, quickly steered to avoid it. Unexpectedly, the wheel did not follow a straight line but instead steered in the direction the boat was trying to avoid. The ten crew members shouted loudly, but the wheel was traveling fast and could not avoid it, causing the boat to be brutally hit by the wheel's bow at the mast. The force of the impact broke the hull in two, and it was immediately drawn into the wheel's bottom. All ten crew members cried for help. The wheel then realized its negligence and immediately rescued them. However, apart from two people who were rescued safely, the other eight were lost at sea. Their fate is unknown. While investigating, a telegram arrived from Dinghai on the 24th, stating that they had all been rescued. Although the crew members were celebrating their survival, Yu Yuanju purchased the boat for their livelihood. The sudden accident is no less than destroying the entire family's life. The estimated loss includes the boat price of 3,200 yuan, the equipment cost of 2,200 yuan, ice money of 70 yuan, and each of the ten crew members' luggage and clothing worth about 20 yuan, totaling 200 yuan, for a total loss of 5,670 yuan. After the accident, the Maritime Bureau was reported to investigate. The wheel was traveling in heavy fog without sounding its horn and at high speed, which is a violation of navigation regulations. The wheel is the Haizhou merchant ship of the Hezhong Company. The above facts are all true. The wheel should be fully responsible. However, the member is doing business in a foreign land and is weak and easily bullied. The wheel is cunningly shirking responsibility, causing the member's capital and the crew members' clothing to be suddenly destroyed and without compensation. We have always admired your association for helping the weak and suppressing the strong, and for upholding justice. The member has suffered this catastrophe, and his life and family are in danger. Therefore, we are urgently pleading for your assistance in negotiating reasonably and ordering the wheel to pay compensation according to the law to maintain their livelihood. The Haizhou merchant ship did not sound its horn and was traveling at high speed in the heavy fog, which is negligent. Moreover, the fishing boat steered to avoid it, but the wheel did not follow a straight line and collided with the hull, cutting it in two. According to reason and logic, it is difficult to shirk responsibility. Based on the above situation, we hereby jointly request your bureau to preside over the matter and order the Hezhong Company to compensate for the losses to show fairness. We respectfully request your approval for handling and a reply. Sincerely, to the Shanghai Maritime Bureau of the Ministry of Communications. Ningbo Shanghai Compatriot Association Chairman Chu Hede, Dinghai Shanghai Compatriot Association Chairman Liu Hongsheng."</p>

<p>The Pudong cleaning campaign, which ran from April 25th to 28th, has concluded. One of the unprecedented initiatives in recent decades is noteworthy: the promotion of personal hygiene and improvement of drinking water from local 老虎灶(lao hu zao, old stove teahouses) on the 27th. Bathhouses offered reduced prices, with large pools costing ten coppers and individual tubs half price, drawing large crowds of bathers. At 1:30 PM that afternoon, a meeting was held with all 老虎灶(lao hu zao, old stove teahouses) owners to discuss improving drinking water. Zhang Mingqin, the director of the Pudong branch bureau, gave a speech, stating, "The deadly weapons in the world, such as guns, bombs, and drugs like heroin and red pills, are all tangible and can be prevented. However, intangible bacteria lurking in raw water are even more deadly. Pudong does not have tap water, and the water drawn from the Huangpu River is even more unclean and contains more bacteria. Therefore, in order to protect the lives and safety of the public, you 老虎灶(lao hu zao, old stove teahouses) owners must improve your water by installing sand filtration systems. We will have Mr. Zhang Qinggen, a cadre from the Youth Association, explain the methods to you." Afterwards, Mr. Zhang provided guidance, stating that the materials needed for the equipment include sand, stone, and palm fibers, costing about two yuan each. After listening to the lecture, the 老虎灶(lao hu zao, old stove teahouses) owners were deeply moved and willing to make improvements. At the end, a photo was taken, and the meeting adjourned. The item for the 28th was to clean up the streets of Pudong, with the goal of removing garbage. About 600 people participated in the work, including the 5th branch of the Shanghai Youth Service Corps, the Xiang Sheng Elementary School Boy Scouts, the military band, the Jing Cun Elementary School, the Fu Xin Elementary School, the Pei Dong Public Security Bureau, and the Yang Jing Security Corps, led by General Commander Xu Baoming. The garbage truck team was led by Health Police Chief Yu Yue. After gathering at the Youth Association stadium for a photo, the Xiang Sheng Elementary School Boy Scouts led the way with military music, parading and touring before carrying out the garbage transport work. The stinking ditch on Jingju Road was buried with water pipes and filled with garbage in order to build a road.</p>

<p>At the Xiong Yuanchang foundry at No. 8 Changqing Lane, Dong Yalu Road, Hongkou, yesterday morning around 7:00 AM, the workers gathered for breakfast. Six of the apprentices ate leftover yellow croaker and celery, but around 2:00 PM in the afternoon, they all complained of abdominal pain and looked pale. The manager of the foundry used a car to send them to Tongren Hospital, where doctors diagnosed them with poisoning. They were given medication and injections and recovered. They were discharged from the hospital around 6:00 PM. The names are listed below: Lu Youkang, 17 years old, from Haimen; Wang Cirong, 26 years old, from Wuxi; Xiong Liangzhi, 17 years old, from Hubei; Xiong Yuanjin, 22 years old, from Hubei; Pan Asi, 16 years old, from Wuxi; Zhao Houzhi, 21 years old.</p>
<h3 id="e135">French Concession: Xieshunxiang Robbed Again; Three of the Thieves Were the Same Ones from the Previous Two Times <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Ling Junxiang, from Ningbo, has been operating the Xieshunxiang cotton cloth store at No. 115-117, a double-fronted storefront opposite Baoyu Lane on Ningxing Street (i.e., Shicai Street) in the French Concession for many years. He is skilled in business and a leader in the cotton cloth industry. In the past, his business was thriving, but in recent years, due to the sluggish business climate, retail and wholesale transactions have declined daily, barely covering expenses. Because of his past fame, he has been coveted by bandits. At the end of the Lunar New Year last year and on February 6th of this year, he was robbed twice, with losses ranging from 200 to 300 yuan each time. Ling reported the incidents to the police and requested an investigation, but the case has not been solved. Unexpectedly, yesterday (the 28th) at 6:30 PM, another seven bandits came, all dressed in silk long jackets and felt hats, well-dressed and unlike bandits. Two people were outside acting as lookouts, and five bandits entered the store, speaking in a northern accent. Because the store had been robbed twice, the accounting room was surrounded by wooden boards and iron doors, leaving only a hole to pass silver coins. The iron door was also equipped with a secret lock, making it difficult for outsiders to enter. Moreover, the silver coins collected from the store were sent to the bank after reaching 100 yuan. Therefore, when the five bandits arrived at the accounting room, they could not find a way in. While they were hesitating, Ling Tinghua, the owner's nephew, saw them inside and recognized three of the bandits as the same ones who had robbed the store in the previous two times. He ran upstairs and blew the whistle. The bandits, hearing the alarm, knew that they could not stay long and rushed out of the store, fleeing westward into Baoyu Lane. Afterwards, the store reported the incident to the Dazimingzhong police station, and the head of the station sent detectives to investigate and await further investigation.</p>

<p>The water in the pond under the Zigzag Bridge in the Yu Garden in this city is unclean, which is detrimental to public health and the survival of the fish. The Chinese Animal Protection Association, in conjunction with the Municipal Public Security Bureau, has taken measures to pump out the dirty water in the pond. The association has also consulted with the Shanghai Inland Tap Water Company to fill the pond with clean water for three hours every night, for three consecutive nights, which can fill the pond. The association has also hired workers to catch the turtles and fish in the pond that eat small fish and send them to the large pond in Dachang to release them. From now on, the fish in the pond under the Zigzag Bridge can swim freely in clean water.</p>

<h3 id="e137">Three Crew Members of the Lian'an Ship Transferred to Court for Investigation; Ministry Revokes Their Certificates <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the case of the Sanbei Company's Wanxiang ship colliding with the Lian'an passenger ship near the Xiaogushan lighthouse in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River in December of the year before last, resulting in the sinking of the Lian'an and the drowning of more than 200 people, the arbitration result has punished the responsible crew members and notified the shipping companies in Shanghai. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Investigation Result: Because more than 200 people drowned in this case, an arbitration committee was organized in Hankou. The Ministry of Transportation and the Navy each sent special commissioners to investigate and impartial persons to conduct on-site investigations. The result was that the Lian'an ship's red and green lights alternately appeared, making it impossible for the Wanxiang ship to avoid it. Therefore, the responsibility and compensation for the deaths and injuries should be borne by the party that caused the accident. The report and judgment were written by Shen Jiyun, the general shipowner of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and announced in Hankou. If the Lian'an side was dissatisfied, they could file an appeal within the legal deadline. The Sanbei Wanxiang ship bears no responsibility.</p>
<p>Transferred to Court: Because the drowned were armed soldiers, the Hankou Maritime Bureau and the arbitration committee reported this case to the Military Affairs Commission for review. Now, Military Affairs Commission Order No. 182 instructs that the Lian'an ship, which caused the accident, has sunk into the river. The responsible crew members of the ship, the first mate Zhang Shaobo, the second mate Wang Dongyin, and the river pilot Xiao Yanqing, were responsible for negligence in performing their duties, resulting in the sinking of the ship and the drowning of more than 200 people. The Military Affairs Commission has ordered that Zhang, Wang, and Xiao be transferred to the court for investigation according to law.</p>
<p>Certificates Revoked: The Military Affairs Commission sent a letter to the Ministry of Transportation, instructing it to order all shipping companies across the country to revoke the certificates of the first mate Zhang Shaobo, the second mate Wang Dongyin, and the river pilot Xiao Yanqing, if they have obtained certificates. In the future, if they apply for crew positions at shipping companies, they should not be hired. The Ministry has notified the Shanghai Maritime Bureau and the state-owned and private shipping companies in Shanghai of this order, instructing them to comply with it.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Shanghai Bank Held Shareholders' Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Trust Department Established, Entrusted to the Board of Directors for Handling. Supervisors Lin Kanghou and Two Others Re-elected.</p>
<p>Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank held its 20th Annual General Meeting of Shareholders at the Ningbo Road headquarters meeting hall yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m. It was resolved to establish a trust department and re-elect three supervisors. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Shareholders' General Meeting: Shareholders representing 29,819 shares, accounting for 15,408 votes, attended, exceeding the legal quorum. Chairman Zhuang Dezhi reported the purpose of the meeting, followed by General Manager Chen Guangfu reporting on the business situation for the year 1934, and Supervisor Lin Kanghou reporting on the audit situation. Regarding the proposed application for establishing a trust department, it was resolved to entrust it to the board of directors for handling. The supervisors were re-elected, with Lin Kanghou, Xue Minlao, and Luo Yuesheng receiving the most votes and being re-elected. The meeting adjourned at 3:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Business Report: The bank's business report for 1934 stated: "In its operations, the bank has consistently adhered to its established prudent policies in order to adapt to the environment. It does not seek luck or excessive profits, but strives for the safety of loans and investments. At the same time, in order to serve society, it contributes its assistance to the improvement of the national economy within the scope of its capabilities. Over the past year, all types of business have fortunately made progress, as reported separately below: Deposits and Loans: (A) Deposits: At the end of 1934, the total deposits of the entire bank, including commercial and savings deposits, amounted to $158,159,145.36. Compared with 1933, the amount increased by $14,608,754.98. Current deposits increased by $2,735,315.00, fixed deposits increased by $6,736,875.39, and savings deposits increased by $5,136,564.59. (B) Loans: In 1934, the total amount of loans from the entire bank was $156,504,389.98, an increase of $25,165,828.05 compared with the end of 1933. Status of Public Reserve and Business Preparation: In order to further enhance the security of deposits and to prepare for future increases in deposits, the bank, with the approval of the board of directors at the end of 1933, increased the public reserve fund to $4 million. This was reported at the previous shareholders' meeting. In May of this year, the board of directors' regular meeting further resolved to increase it to $5 million. At the end of the year, another $100,000 was withdrawn from the surplus item as a public reserve fund, totaling $5.1 million, which has exceeded the bank's capital of $100,000. At the same time, the business reserve fund has also been continuously increased to $2.25 million, which can be said to be a generous protection for the interests of depositors. Business Status of the Savings Department: At the end of 1934, the total savings deposits of the entire bank were $38,439,419.12, an increase of $5,136,564.59 compared with the end of 1933. Among them, current savings increased by $2,601,100.08, and fixed savings increased by $1,535,464.51. Loans at the end of 1934, including those placed in the commercial department, were $34,689,964.62, an increase of $3,167,212.42 compared with the end of 1933. In terms of type, one is secured loans. At the end of 1934, they amounted to $19,988,935.26, an increase of $11,108,317.72 compared with the previous year, accounting for more than half of the total loans. Among them, securities collateral loans accounted for 35%, agricultural product and rural cooperative loans accounted for 32%, real estate collateral loans accounted for 27%, and deposit certificate and passbook collateral loans accounted for 6%. One is securities purchase. At the end of 1934, it was $7,796,199.53, an increase of $3,077,320.87 compared with the end of 1933, an increase of about 67%. The reason for the increase is that the Savings Bank Law stipulates that savings banks must have one-quarter of the total savings deposits in government bonds, treasury bills, and other assets deposited in the Central Bank as a guarantee for deposits. In order to meet this need, securities purchases have shown a sharp increase. One is deposits in the commercial department. At the end of 1934, it was $6,904,829.83, a decrease of $11,018,426.17 compared with the end of 1933, a decrease of about 64%. This is because the Savings Bank Law imposes restrictions on deposits in the commercial department. In short, the use of savings funds has generally complied with the provisions of the Savings Bank Law. General Situation of Foreign Exchange Department: The volatility of the foreign exchange market this year is as intense as in the past. Coupled with the shrinking of foreign trade, foreign exchange operations are fraught with difficulties. The department's business has always been very stable, and it continues not to seek luck or engage in speculation. Therefore, even under difficult circumstances, it still has considerable progress. In terms of import and export documentary bills, export documentary bills have increased slightly compared with the previous year, and import documentary bills have decreased by about 12%. However, collections of import bills have doubled. The total amount of the two is still greater than in the previous year. Remittances and purchases of bills are similar to those in the previous year. This is because the foreign exchange released this year is longer, and the value is reduced when calculated in our national currency. If expressed in foreign currency, it is also greater than in the previous year. However, customs duty trading has decreased by 40% compared with the previous year. Sales of traveler's checks and traveler's letters of credit have increased by almost one letter compared with the previous year. In addition, in terms of foreign currency deposits, the total amount at the end of this year has increased by about one-third compared with the end of last year, with current deposits increasing the most. In short, all kinds of business in the department are in a steady process of progress. The business reserve fund, in addition to writing off a small number of bad debts, is also increasing year by year, and its foundation can be called strong. General Situation of the Agricultural Department: In order to serve the rural community and promote agricultural cooperation, an agricultural cooperative loan department was established in 1933, and branches were established in the Nanjing, Zhengzhou, and Changsha sub-branches to handle loans for marketing cooperation, credit cooperation, and agricultural warehouses. The total amount of loans was more than 1.02 million yuan, which greatly benefited farmers. It is also quite secure for the bank. This year, it continued to proceed, and the agricultural cooperative loan department was changed to the agricultural department. Agricultural sections were established in Nanjing, Bengbu, Jinan, Xi'an, Changsha, Hankou, Guangzhou, and other sub-branches. The business area covered Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hubei, Hunan, and nine provinces. The total amount of loans was more than 4.44 million yuan, an increase of more than four times compared with the previous year, which is a major progress. Among them, 90% are marketing cooperation loans and agricultural warehouse loans, and credit cooperation loans only account for about 8%. The bank believes that a commercial bank engaged in agricultural lending can only be limited to the turnover of short-term funds, and for the sake of prudent operation, it is especially important to emphasize the credit of goods. Therefore, most of the loans are short-term and mostly secured by commodities. Judging from the distribution trend of various agricultural loans this year, it is sufficient to prove that it can still follow this purpose and proceed. Since 1933, the accounting of the agricultural department has been independent of the commercial department. This year, because it is still in the trial stage, the cost of surveying new areas is also huge, so the expenditure is large, and the income and expenditure can only be balanced. However, all loans released can be returned on time, reducing bad debts and other matters, which can be gratifying.</p>
<p>Distribution of Net Profit: The net profit for 1934 was $936,061.33, an increase of $99,058.96 compared with 1933. The general distribution is listed as follows: (1) The net profit for the first half of the year was $412,264.92, plus the accumulated balance of $14,956.68 from the previous period, totaling $427,221.60. It was resolved by the board of directors on July 25 to distribute as follows: (1) Pay each shareholder a public interest of 2.5% and a bonus of 2.5% for the first half of the year, totaling $250,000. (1) Pre-withdraw staff remuneration of $100,000, and the remaining balance of $77,221.60 will be transferred to the next period's account. (1) The net profit for the second half of the year was $523,796.41, plus the accumulated balance of $77,221.60 from the previous period, totaling $601,018.01. It was resolved by the board of directors on January 21, 1935, to distribute as follows: (1) Deposit $100,000 as a public reserve fund. (1) Pay each shareholder a public interest of 2.5% and a bonus of 2.5% for the second half of the year, totaling $250,000. (1) Remuneration for directors and supervisors is $10,000. (1) Remuneration for general and deputy managers and bonuses for staff is $210,000, and the remaining balance of $31,018.01 will be transferred to the next period's account.</p>
<h3 id="e139">American Military Vehicle Ran Over and Killed a Rickshaw Puller. The Family Demands Compensation. Requests the Forwarding of a Letter to the US Consul in Shanghai <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>The Xin Xin News Agency reported that Yu Ji Shi, the mother of Yu Wei Wang, the rickshaw puller who was run over and killed by a military vehicle of the US Navy Fourth Regiment in the French Concession, has submitted a petition to Mayor Wu and others due to her son's tragic death and impoverished state, as well as the lack of means for the surviving orphans and widows. She requested that a letter be forwarded to the US Consul in Shanghai, requesting compensation. Her original petition stated: "Presenting this petition because my only son was tragically run over and killed by an American military vehicle, and I am old and helpless. Requesting permission for relief and promptly forwarding a letter requesting compensation. The petitioner is currently 72 years old and has one son named Yu Wei Wang, who is 28 years old this year. He has been pulling rickshaws for a living at Su Li's house at No. 20 Baoan Road in the Nanshi area of this port. The entire family of five, old and young, has relied on Yu Wei Wang's livelihood for many years. On March 16th of this year at about 5 p.m., the deceased Yu Wei Wang was pulling a rickshaw with the registration number 10821 of the French Concession, traveling from east to west on the left side of the road at the intersection of Wang Zhi Road and Beile Road in the French Concession. Suddenly, a military vehicle of the US Navy Fourth Regiment stationed in China came speeding from behind the deceased without honking its horn, causing the deceased to be unable to avoid it. In addition to the rickshaw with the registration number 10821 being completely destroyed, the deceased was killed on the spot due to being run over. The situation was extremely tragic. At that time, the military vehicle was taken to the French Concession Police Station, and the investigation showed that the American soldier should be fully responsible. However, due to extraterritoriality, the French Concession was unable to handle it according to law and transferred the military vehicle to the commander of the Navy Fourth Regiment, who sent someone to take it away. The outcome is still unknown. I think that my son Yu Wei Wang died tragically, which is extremely pitiful, and his death was also extremely desolate. The petitioner and the orphans and widows have a long way to go in the future, and what will they rely on for their livelihood? I want to seek legal relief, but due to the jurisdiction of consular trials, it is difficult to proceed. As a last resort, I specially submit the whole story and implore your (government) (bureau) (association) to grant relief and allow me to forward a letter to the US Consulate General in Shanghai to promptly provide compensation, so that the spirit of the deceased can be comforted, and the lives of the orphans and widows can be maintained, so as to emphasize humanity. This would be a great favor." Respectfully presented to Wu, Mayor of the Shanghai Municipal Government; Wu, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Government Social Affairs Bureau; the Shanghai Citizens' Federation of the Second Special District; and the Shanghai French Concession Taxpaying Chinese Association.</p>

<p>The Central News Agency reported that about 2,000 boxes of Japanese oil were shipped to Shanghai on the 27th by the Japanese postal ship "Daiya Maru". After unloading, they were sold to various business circles. The sale of Japanese oil to China has recently increased. Initially, it was only dozens to hundreds of boxes. This time, a large number of shipments were sent to China for dumping. It is reported that more shipments will continue to arrive. The oil market in our country has been dominated by American and Soviet Russian oil. In the future, Japanese merchants will participate in the competition, so it is predicted that the price will tend to decline.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Da Hu Bank Held Shareholders' Meeting Yesterday. Jin Runxiang and Others Elected as Supervisors <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>This city's Da Hu Bank held its third annual general meeting of shareholders in the conference room on the second floor of the bank yesterday, reporting on business and re-electing supervisors. The details are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Meeting Situation: Shareholders Zhu Meixian, Luo Qinghua, Zheng Xiaozhou, Shen Jinfu, Zheng Zenan, Lang Zhihao, Li Zuqing, Yu Guozhen, Wang Hong, Ma Shaoquan, Bian Chongxian, Lin Qiong'an, and others, totaling 78 people, attended, representing 2542 shares. Yu Guozhen chaired the meeting. After performing the etiquette, the business situation was first reported, followed by Supervisor Li Heqing reporting on the accounts. Then, the supervisors whose terms had expired were re-elected. Li Heqing, Jin Runxiang, and Wu Zhihao were elected as supervisors. Gu Zhenmin was elected as alternate supervisor.</p>
<p>Business Report: At the beginning of the bank's opening, it coincided with the aftermath of the Shanghai war. The business and financial markets were showing signs of decline. Until last year, due to the impact of the US silver policy, credit became extremely tight. As the year was coming to an end, banks and money shops with historical credit were seen clearing, going into liquidation, and collapsing, one after another. However, the bank's business has only been three years old so far. It has been able to stand firm in the midst of stormy waves, dealing with things with ease and steadily overcoming difficulties. This is not only due to the bank's consistent prudent policies and the trust of society, but also to the guidance of the shareholders and the assistance of colleagues. If the market turns better in the future, the development of the bank's business will have hope. This can be told to the shareholders. As the bank's business gradually grew last year, and the receipts and payments became more frequent, the original location on Shanxi Road was not enough to expand the layout. Therefore, a site was selected at No. 510 Nanjing Road, and construction materials were gathered. It was not until December 1st last year that we were able to move in. With convenient transportation and a magnificent foundation, the business has seen great prosperity. At the time of the year-end settlement, the total value of all the bank's assets and the total value of the assets of the savings department's head office and branches were higher than in the previous year. This can be told to the shareholders. At the second session of the third board of directors meeting, the bank resolved to establish a Hangzhou branch and began preparations. It opened in March last year. Although the business hours have only been more than three months, the receipt of various deposits has reached more than 100,000 yuan. If given a considerable period of time, the gradual development of the business is to be expected. This can be told to the shareholders. In view of the fact that each important area of the bank in this port has branches and sub-branches, and the competition in business is very fierce, in order to avoid the heavy and take the light, the bank chose counties and cities in the interior with prosperous commerce to establish sub-offices in order to have more opportunities to serve the rural areas. In view of the fact that Pinghu County in Zhejiang has convenient transportation and wealthy residents, and that in addition to the old-fashioned money shops holding the financial hub, the emerging banking organizations have not yet been established, we chose a site on Dongmen Avenue in the city to establish a Pinghu office at extremely low cost. It started business on April 15 and has been deeply trusted by local people, especially receiving praise from the Pinghu Xinglun community. This can be told to the shareholders. In the future, the bank's operational policy will be to uphold the spirit of steady progress, work hard, and continue to choose inland counties and cities with prosperous commerce that other banks have not yet paid attention to, and gradually establish sub-offices in order to expand the bank's financial network for serving society, so as to live up to the shareholders' expectations.</p>

First, the general manager gave a welcome speech, stating that the chairman had traveled to Europe, and the board of directors had publicly elected Director Zhang Gongquan to succeed him. Director Zhang has always been enthusiastic about maintaining the company. In the future, taking on the role of chairman and leading colleagues to work hard will be a blessing for the company's future. Then, Director Zhang briefly gave a reply, which was extremely modest. Then, the meeting was opened, the previous motions were read, and the company's business report for the year 1934 and the agenda of the second annual general meeting of shareholders were reviewed, and the amendment of the company's articles of association and the measures for increasing shares in this session were discussed. The results were very satisfactory. It is heard that the company's business in 1934 was very good, exceeding previous records. Compared with income and expenditure, there was a considerable surplus. In addition to the statutory withdrawal of public reserve fund, asset depreciation, employee remuneration, welfare fund, and special public reserve fund, shareholders can receive an official interest rate of 8% and a bonus of 3%. The company plans to increase its capital by 1 million yuan. Half of it has been undertaken by the current directors and supervisors, and the remaining 500,000 yuan will first be offered to the old shareholders for subscription. If the number is insufficient, it will be raised from the outside world. Once the capital is increased, the business will develop more and more, and the future prospects are very optimistic. It is heard that the meeting adjourned at around 4 p.m.</p>

Around 7:00, Ma Yanwen, the general manager of the association, along with personnel in charge of general affairs and personnel matters, went to the station to set up a reception. After the representatives of each factory arrived at the station and sent their luggage into the carriages, they rested briefly in the lounge. Representatives from various organizations, including Ma Jisheng, Lu Xingzhuang, Sun Jiren, Zhang Zilian, and Jiang Zhonghe, went to the station one after another to see them off.

<h3 id="e147">Ningbo and Dinghai Fellow Countrymen Associations Urgently Request the Ban of Liva Village Pleasure Boats <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Liva Kurita Village in Western Shanghai, which connects to the public river, provides rowing boats specifically for tourists to enjoy leisurely rides. On the 22nd of this month, Chen Wenlan and Chen Xiufeng, siblings from Dinghai, went to the village for a boat ride and tragically drowned. The details have already been recorded in this newspaper. Now, the Ningbo Association in Shanghai and the Dinghai Association in Shanghai, considering that the village has no life-saving equipment and that it concerns public safety, have sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Municipal Public Security Bureau, requesting them to find a way to ban it. Their original letter is as follows: We humbly inform you that upon reading a news item in this newspaper on the 22nd of this month, entitled "Tragic Rowing Accident at Liva Kurita Village Yesterday," we were shocked to learn that our fellow countrymen Chen Wenlan and Chen Xiufeng had tragically drowned in the village. We immediately sent personnel to Chen's residence to inquire about the situation and rushed to the scene of the accident in the village to investigate. Afterward, we were informed that the rowing boats in the village are about 16 feet long and 7.5 feet wide, with pointed bows and sterns and narrow bottoms. The river at that location is about ten or more zhang wide and over two zhang deep. We have verified that the river is a public river, extending for several li. The section near the village is less than ten zhang, and beyond that, the river flows through open fields. There are no sidewalks or docks along the banks, and there is absolutely no life-saving equipment. At the starting point, there is a sign stating that the fee is one yuan per hour, without boatmen, etc. We have taken films of the sign and the boat's hull and are submitting them for review. We have found that the village provides rowing boats for people to play with, charging as much as one yuan per hour, but not only are there no boatmen, there is also no life-saving equipment, and the river connects far beyond the village, being both wide and deep. In this situation, the village owner is treating human lives as a joke. The dead are gone, but the future is long, and we must take measures to prevent similar incidents from happening again. Therefore, we jointly submit this letter to the Municipal Bureau Chief for your review. We urge you to promptly investigate and strictly ban the operation to avoid future dangers and also request a reply. We believe that after the Municipal Government and the Municipal Public Security Bureau approve the letter, there will certainly be corresponding measures taken to prevent a recurrence of such an event.</p>

<p>The Labor Department of the Shanghai YWCA at 55 Yuanmingyuan Road has always worked diligently for the labor movement. Every year on Labor Day, May 1st, they hold a grand commemoration. This year, because the day is not a Sunday, many ladies could not easily participate, so it was changed to 2:00 PM on Sunday afternoon, April 28th, at the association's fourth floor for an early commemoration. The program included dramas, songs, Peking opera, harmonica, etc., all performed by students from the association's various women's worker schools. Ms. Wang Yiwei, the chief writer of the Women's Voice Society, was invited to give a speech on "The Meaning and Mission of Labor Day."

<h3 id="e149">A Leading Figure in the Aviation Field, Qin Dajun, Will Return to China Soon <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Among those in China who study aviation, some only learn to fly, while others only know about machinery. Most have not deeply studied the principles. There are even fewer who are proficient in the principles, enthusiastically study aircraft and motor manufacturing, and also know how to fly. The advanced parts of aviation principles require the application of higher physics and mathematics. It is not easy to understand without a good foundation in mathematics and physics and many years of research in aviation. Now, there is Qin Dajun, from Wuxi, a graduate of the Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry Department of the former National Nanjing Higher Normal School and a Bachelor of Science from Southeast University. He studied in France and Germany for three years. In France, he graduated from the Paris National Higher Aviation School and obtained a degree in Aviation Engineering from the French Ministry of Aviation. He then obtained a German Engineering Doctorate from the German National Aachen Aviation Research Institute. He interned in aviation factories in France and Germany and visited and surveyed testing laboratories and factories in various European countries. Mr. Qin's honors abroad and his profound practical knowledge are both rare and valuable. It is rare for Chinese people to obtain a French National Aviation Engineer degree in France, and it is also extremely rare to obtain an Engineering Doctorate degree in Germany (an Engineering Doctorate is the most difficult degree to obtain in Germany). Mr. Qin has obtained both. It is truly gratifying that China's aviation field has gained another talent. It is said that Mr. Qin will return to China in mid-May to serve his motherland.</p>

<p>The famous doctor Yu Yongkang graduated from the Medical Department of Tongji University in 1928. He then served in the venereal disease and dermatology department and the obstetrics department of Shanghai Baozhen Hospital for six years, treating countless patients. He now has his own clinic at 22 Xiude New Village, Chengdu Road. Based on his clinical experience, he discovered a method for dissipating buboes. His thesis was published in the most famous German medical journal on venereal diseases and dermatology, volume 99, issue 51. As a result, he was awarded a medical doctorate. At the Medical and Natural Science Society meeting on the 27th of this month (the day before yesterday), Dr. Kan Lo, a famous professor from a German university, presented Mr. Yu with his medical doctorate certificate, creating a grand scene for a time.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Overview of the Rose Garden New Village Project <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The Rose Garden New Village, built by the China New Village Construction Society, has been progressing step by step according to the planned construction stages since construction began on December 9th of last year. It is expected that it can be fully completed within this year. Here is a brief overview of the village's construction:</p>
<p>Residences of All Levels: The ABC-level residences in the village have already started construction, and 60-70% of the entire roofing and interior decoration and partitioning have been completed. The landscaping is now being planned. The residences are surrounded by greenery as fences, creating a quiet and beautiful environment. Seasonal flowers and trees are planted in the courtyard, changing the scenery at any time, making the courtyard and residences complement each other. The foundation and grey-line wall base construction for the DE-level residences has also begun.</p>
<p>Surrounding Walls: Hedges are being built around the village. Steel fences are used as barriers along the Shanghai-Minhang Road, all of which have been completed. Empty space of several inches is left outside the steel fence, planted with evergreen shrubs, forming an outward-sloping or wavy shape. Various colors of climbing roses will be planted at the base of the steel fence to display the unique style of the village.</p>
<p>Road Construction: The section of Shanghai-Minhang Road within the village area has been planted with roadside trees by the society, using large-leaf French plane trees. The base and drainage ditches of the roads within the village have mostly been completed. The construction of the lawns on both sides and the electric poles is planned to begin within the next few days. The road surface is temporarily delayed due to the transport of freight vehicles. French plane trees will be planted as roadside trees on the north-south roads in the village, and German locust trees will be selected for the east-west roads.</p>
<p>River Channel Improvement: The dredging project of the Liuyun River in the village has been completed. The construction of the lawns, sidewalks, electric poles, and mud piers on both sides is also being planned. It is planned to build steel and concrete bridges over the Liuyun River that crosses Boai and Huzu Roads. The bridge on Huzu Road has already started construction. Trees have also begun to be planted on both sides of the river channel, with a mixture of dragon junipers and spherical junipers. Benches will be set up underneath for residents to rest.</p>
<p>Remaining Residences: According to the business department of the society, there are still some residences remaining in the village, including four B-level residences and five D-level residences. Those who love the new village life should purchase them quickly, lest they regret it later. In addition, the society's specially created new village real estate cooperative investment, which takes into account the interests of both homeowners and residents, has been widely sympathized with and praised by all sectors of society. Many people have been going to the agency department at 918 Aidingia Road in recent days to obtain information and discuss investments.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Buddhist Association's Ciyou Orphanage on Gonghe Xin Road in Zhabei usually pays great attention to work-study programs and healthy living. Recently, in order to cultivate children's ability to serve, they organized a Boys' Service Corps and provided various new training methods, with excellent results. Whenever various groups and ships are recruited for service, they are quite effective in maintaining order. Considering that residents near the orphanage do not pay much attention to cleanliness and hygiene, which is detrimental to public health, the corps leads its members to clean up daily and also posts notices to promote the meaning of the New Life Movement. In recent days, the area near the orphanage has been cleared of all filth, and the atmosphere is completely new, for which the residents are very grateful.</p>

<p>The weather in this city has been alternating between cold and warm, with dense fog. The thermometer had reached above 80 degrees the day before yesterday, and citizens were wearing thin clothing.

The Huangpu River was shrouded in fog all day, making it difficult to distinguish anything beyond a hundred steps. Citizens are catching colds easily due to the cold and warm weather, especially children. A Pacific hurricane has also emerged.

<h3 id="e154">Continued Report on the Murderer's Prison Break from the Second Special District Court Detention Center <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Chen Jinlan Planned Her Escape Early, Yang Xingcun and Yan Ling Appear in Court</p>
<p>Chen Jinlan, a murderer detained in the Second Special District Court Detention Center, escaped from prison, implicating the guards on duty. Fang Yuqi was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment, and Zhou Wenjin was sentenced to two years of imprisonment. Later, the police arrested Chen and Wang Afu, who lent Chen money for hiding, and escorted them to the Second Special District Court's Criminal Court. The prosecutor and the police department filed public lawsuits against Chen and Wang separately. According to Chen's confession, he escaped around 1:00 AM on the night of December 26th, during the shift of a guard named Yang. This has already been reported in the newspapers. Now, Sun Xionggen, who is concurrently serving as the director of the detention center, based on the time Chen confessed, ordered the guards Yang Xingcun and Yan Ling to be placed under supervision and transferred to the prosecutor's office for investigation and handling. The day before yesterday, Prosecutor Wang Ren, accompanied by Clerk Peng Yi, specially opened Criminal Court No. 2 and ordered Chen, Yang, and Yan to be brought in for questioning. According to Chen Jinlan's confession, he was arrested for a murder case and sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment. After the appeal, the sentence was reduced to 12 years. He felt that this lawsuit was truly unjust, so after the first judgment, he had the intention of escaping. First, he found a half-foot-long piece of lead wire used by prisoners to pick their ears in another room. He usually paid attention to how the guards opened the inner and outer iron doors, which were opened with one key. So, when it was quiet, he made a key. He had already made it a month ago. On the night of December 26th, about two hours after the guards changed shifts, around 1:00 AM, the guard named Yang was running back and forth. He heard the sound of his leather shoes running outside the release room around the corner. He then opened the door and went outside and walked out of the main gate. Yan Ling testified that he was transferred from Caohejing to serve. At the time of Chen's escape, it had only been a little over a month. He did not know Chen. He was in charge of the main gate and also the iron gate. It was a mobile position. If the director and others came in and out, he would have to open the door. He did not see Chen escape. The official said that former Director Gao said that Yan was in charge of the main gate, not a mobile position. Yan replied that he asked to investigate with the people in the office and his colleagues. The director, Bai Zengqing, was also summoned to inquire about Yan Ling's position. Yang Xingcun was not mentioned. According to his confession, when he took over and left the shift, he checked the prisoners in each cell and there were no missing. He was in charge of seven cells. He only discovered Chen's escape when he opened it at 7:00 AM. After the interrogation, the official ordered Chen to be sent back to custody. Yang and Yan returned to the detention center to await further investigation. The court then adjourned.</p>

<p>At the home of Zhang Baohua, a farmer in Dongxuliqiao Village, Luodian Town, Baoshan County, around 9:00 PM on the evening of the 26th (the day before yesterday), a large group of over twenty robbers suddenly arrived, each holding iron and wooden sticks, long and short knives, and pistols. At that time, Zhang and his family were all asleep. The robbers pried open the gate and rushed in. Zhang heard the noise and suspected that they were thieves, so he immediately called his family to get up and shout for help. Unexpectedly, this angered the robbers. Knives and sticks were wielded at the same time, striking people indiscriminately, knocking Zhang Baohua's entire family to the ground, bleeding profusely. The robbers saw that they had all fallen to the ground, and then sent several robbers to watch over them. Several robbers guarded the gate, and the rest entered the bedrooms to search. They rummaged through the boxes and cabinets and robbed silver dollars, gold jewelry, etc., worth about 300 yuan, and then left swaggeringly. Later, the injured people were sent to Luodian Hospital for treatment. It was heard that Zhang Baohua was attacked in the head by the robbers, and the injury was extremely serious, and there was a danger to his life. It was also learned that around 10:00 PM that night, the home of Qian Kunxiang, a villager in Dongqian Village in the town, was also robbed in the same way, with greater losses, but no one was injured. Around 11:00 PM on the following day (Saturday), six or seven people suddenly came to the home of Zhu Bingsheng, the station chief of Changbangqiao Station on Shanghai-Taicang Road, also holding iron and wooden sticks, knives and guns. They first destroyed the telephone of the Shanghai-Taicang Long-Distance Bus Company, and then tied up Station Chief Zhu with ropes and searched as they pleased. It is estimated that clothing, silver notes, etc. worth over 100 yuan were robbed. The victims in the above cases have all reported to the Luodian Town Public Security Bureau, requesting them to investigate and pursue the stolen goods and the robbers.</p>

<p>B. Domestic Economic Recession</p>
<p>Now, let's look back at the current state of our country's economy. What is it like? And what is the impact on the banking industry? The exchange rate of silver dollars has naturally shrunk due to the fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Regarding important matters such as production, prices, and trade, the details are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The production of major food crops only accounts for 82% of the previous year (estimated by the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute). Although the value of imported foreign rice decreased by approximately 8 million yuan compared to the previous year, wheat also decreased by approximately 5 million yuan, and flour decreased by approximately 2 million yuan, the average index of agricultural products in various regions in the first half of the year was more than 20% lower than the same period last year. The price of flour once fell to around 1.90 yuan per bag.</p>
<p>(2) Although the cotton output is estimated to increase by approximately one million piculs this year compared to the previous year, and the price has improved due to the assistance of banks and cooperatives, the average market price of standard cotton throughout the year is still 7.9 cents lower than the previous year. The value of imported foreign cotton decreased by approximately 8.8 million yuan due to the increase in tariffs.</p>
<p>(3) Due to the reduction in working hours per week in cotton mills nationwide, the output of cotton yarn decreased, and inventory was lower than the previous year. The lowest price once fell to 170 yuan. The average market price of standard yarn throughout the year in Guannei was 19.67 yuan lower than the previous year. The imported quantity is difficult to calculate due to the products of foreign-owned yarn mills in China. However, there is already a committee organized for the control of cotton yarn.</p>
<p>(4) Due to the severe decline in the silk market, most silk mills have suspended operations, resulting in a decrease in both production and sales. The export value decreased by approximately 28 million yuan compared to the previous year. The price of raw silk in the Shanghai foreign exchange market sharply declined, regardless of whether it was yellow, white, upper, or lower grades. In August and September, the average market price of mid-grade mill silk was 460 yuan, a decrease of more than 300 yuan compared to the same period in the tenth year (records from the Raw Silk Export Association). The control of silk cocoons is still in its initial stages.</p>
<p>(5) Due to the severe cold in Anhui, the main tea-producing area, last winter, the tea harvest was very poor, estimated to be only 180,000 piculs. Fortunately, the sales of black tea to the United Kingdom and Russia have rebounded, exports have increased, and the market price is also high. However, the price of green tea has fallen sharply, and foreign sales have also decreased. The statistics for tea exports are approximately 36 million yuan, an increase of approximately 2 million yuan compared to the previous year. Overall, both import and export trade have decreased, but the trade deficit still reached a huge amount of more than 49.4 million yuan.</p>
<p>In summary, production has decreased, prices have fallen, exchange rates have shrunk, and trade is in reverse. The rural economy is on the verge of bankruptcy. The purchasing power of the people has become increasingly weak, leading to a sharp decline in the prosperity of the market. The price of urban real estate has fallen sharply, resulting in increased unemployment and tighter credit. Initially, domestic funds were concentrated in cities, and interbank lending rates were as low as Bai Xie. Subsequently, silver flowed out, and credit became tight, with daily lending rates as high as six cents. Since June, the United States has been buying silver, and the price of silver in Shanghai has often been lower than that in the United Kingdom and the United States. Due to the pursuit of profit, the amount of silver exported was very large. Although the government levied silver taxes, cracked down on speculative bidding, and stipulated measures such as stable exchange rates and stable markets in an attempt to control the situation, the overall effect on the situation was limited. The total silver surplus from the entire country was worth more than 15.59 million silver dollars. At the end of the year, the silver reserves in Shanghai were only more than 25.1 million silver dollars. Including silver ingots and large bars, the total was only approximately 33.5 million yuan, a decrease of 26 million yuan compared to the highest reserve amount this year. With the reserves being depleted and credit becoming tighter, it has led to an extremely tight financial situation in the city. International economic policies are so unfavorable to our country's economy, and the impact on Shanghai's financial industry is so great. The difficulty in coping with the situation is evident.

<p>— (He Wei)</p>
<p>The more one realizes that people must die, the harder one should strive. Since it is known that this body will inevitably dissolve in the future, wouldn't it be greatly worthwhile to build this dissolving body on beneficial endeavors?</p>
<p>When the ground is muddy during rain, one thinks of how comfortable it will be when the weather is clear. But when the weather is clear, who still thinks of the pain of rain? Greed may be a bad habit in life, but at the same time, it can enable one to build great achievements.</p>
<p>If a person can often think of 'the pain of asking others for help when one has no money' when they are rich, I believe they will certainly not regard money as less important than a feather.</p>
<p>The surface of reality is simple and crude, while the surface of falsehood is beautiful and enviable. Therefore, most people in the world abandon reality and pursue falsehood!</p>
<h3 id="e169">The Dancer Without Fashion <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Da Mu</p>
<p>Every weekend evening, we always spend two hours at tea dances. Generally speaking, it is still the cheapest form of entertainment. Three or four familiar friends occupy a small round table in that stimulating room with elegant and natural posture, sitting, drinking strong coffee, tasting delicately woven inlaid pastries, and smoking the cigarettes that one loves and carries in the pocket.</p>
<p>As soon as that "Whistling In the Dark" tune starts, it's like a general mobilization order has been issued. Dance partners bump into each other in the dark. Youngsters whose footwork isn't skilled refuse to miss this session, and those who are obsessed with sensuality also refuse to miss it. The foxtrot has a sense of familiarity, but this session has a more tender and secluded sentiment. My friends all embraced their respective loved ones and blended into the darkness.</p>
<p>Sitting alone, propping my chin up, coldly watching the large whirlpool of men and women in front of me, swirling around and around. However, a girl who was close to the edge of the whirlpool, hanging her head, caught my eye. She was also sitting alone, coldly, just like me. However, she was the seller of stimulation and gentleness, and in such an attractive place, she was still abandoned. Why? I started to wonder, feeling that her loneliness was different from mine, and her deeply furrowed brow probably tasted bitter!</p>
<p>However, my friends refused to forgive her, "What is there that makes people feel powerful? She doesn't even have a relatively eye-catching fashion." Everyone said with a sneer. However, I was fortunate for her, "Fashion saved her body." I silently praised the dancer without fashion.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Rambling Talk on Goldfish <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Jiren</p>
<p>I recently received a letter from Mr. Chen Zhelu of Nantai, Fujian, inquiring about the treatment method for goldfish developing white spots. Therefore, based on my limited knowledge, I offer a few suggestions.</p>
<p>The white spots on the fish's body are initially small and indistinguishable, gradually becoming apparent and increasing in number. According to this, these white spots are not generated from within the body, but are a type of bacteria. This can be proven by microscopic examination. They bite into the fish's skin, penetrating deep into the flesh, spreading extremely quickly, and can spread throughout the entire tank in no time. The methods of prevention are: first, isolation, to prevent contact with healthy fish; second, do not change the water, let it remain in the original water, as changing the water will only accelerate their death; third, do not feed, it must be stopped for a long time, only until the fish's illness has completely subsided (no more white spots are seen) and the color has returned (the fish's color fades when ill, lacking its previous luster), can it be fed normally; fourth, expose it to more sunlight. The white spots gradually turn red when exposed to sunlight, and then turn grayish-brown. This is a sign that the bacteria are dying. If the fish is still fed after the illness, the fish's body will be nourished and abundant, and the bacteria will be able to grow even longer, making it not only difficult to treat, but also causing it to spread throughout the body and die. I believe that the methods for treating white spots, in addition to quick isolation, stopping feeding, not changing the water, and more exposure to sunlight, have no other methods.</p>
<p>Why do fish with white spots mostly originate from northern fish bodies? There is also a reason for this. Northern fish are transported south by ship, packed in wooden barrels. The area of the barrel, let's say, can usually hold a hundred fish, but when they are loaded onto the ship, they must put in five or six hundred fish, because they want to have more quantity and take up less space. However, when there are many fish and the container is small, they must float to the surface, so they often add fresh water to regulate it. After many days of travel, the disease has been lurking. When they arrive in Shanghai, they are changed to the water here. At first, they seem very lively, so they are fed normally. Little do they know, after not too long, they will gradually stiffen and die. Some may even last until the new year (fish are transported in winter). Once the peach blossom water rises, almost all northern fish die. The symptoms include growing white spots, and sometimes they also develop rot. Some may not even show any symptoms, but nineteen out of ten cannot escape.</p>
<p>According to the above, it seems that northern fish cannot be transported south. No, that's not true. What is the method? That is, after the fish are transported, place them in a tank and do not feed them throughout the winter. Only after the spring thunder has sounded and it has rained many times can they be fed. If fish are transported like this, they will not only have no white spot disease, but will also be able to adapt to the local climate of the south. Some may ask, won't they become thin and damaged if they are not fed throughout the winter? No, it doesn't matter. Therefore, it is clear that those who purchase northern fish species cannot adapt to the local climate unless they pass through two seasons of cold and heat.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen also inquired that sometimes fish tails grow insects that lie within the mucous membrane, and over time, they bleed. These insects look like earthworms, as thin as a thread, and several inches long. They heal immediately after being removed, and are not harmful. This is called a leech, which is indeed found in Suzhou. They are mostly mixed into the fish tank from water maggots. Pay close attention when feeding and remove them immediately, there is no major problem.</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Description of Phoenix Shoes: Almost everything that can be written about shoes has already been written. Now there is only one last point that can be discussed, and that is the relationship between shoes and the seasons. Even the shoes worn by commoners have different categories such as cotton shoes, lined shoes, and gauze shoes, so what about the Empress Dowager? In Chapter Eight of this book, I mentioned that the materials of the clothes in the palace must be changed according to the seasons, and even the flowers embroidered on the clothes have their own regulations. The same is true for shoes, so there is no need to repeat it. I will only talk about the phoenix shoes used by the Empress Dowager in winter. The Empress Dowager certainly does not want to wear heavy cotton shoes, so her shoes are lined with the best silk cotton, and the opening of the shoes is edged with a circle of leather. This circle of leather is naturally made of silver rat or sable.</p>
<p>The artisans employed by the Empress Dowager were all settled behind Longevity Hill, across from Kunming Lake. On this hillside, several palace courtyards of similar sizes were neatly separated, with each courtyard housing artisans of a specific craft, never mixed together. For example, there was a dedicated palace courtyard for those who raised silkworms, and the artisans who made silk also had their own residences and workplaces, and the shoemakers had another place. Although they were very close, they all had their own separate entrances, like several independent factories. Therefore, this part of the Summer Palace can be said to be a small-scale industrial area. The artisans inside were as busy as a swarm of bees all year round. However, all the products here are very different from the products of any factory in China: first, the silk, cocoons, or phoenix shoes needed in the palace are not just one or two types, but often hundreds or thousands of types, and each type does not need to be much, only very exquisite one or two pieces; second, the skills of the artisans in the palace are indeed higher than those of all other workers elsewhere, as a result of on-site comparisons.

<p>Local Customs and Anecdotes</p>
<h3 id="e173">Strolling in Hangzhou <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Geda</p>
<p>I often say that Zhou Shixun is our most interesting leader because even a joke from his flexible mouth contains philosophy or psychology. From our trip to Hangzhou this time, I am even more convinced that there is no exaggeration in my words.</p>
<p>When our group reached the middle of the Nine Creeks and Eighteen Streams, Shidong's witty remarks began, he said, friends! "Do you know? Hangzhou is made up of three types of people, one is "dead people," one is "half-dead people," and one is "living people." Only with dead people can there be "chastity archways, tombs, and ancestral halls." Only with half-dead people can there be "forests, temples, churches, and monasteries." Only with living people can there be "spring outings, pilgrimages, and Buddhist worship." If one of the three is missing, it cannot be Hangzhou." We certainly couldn't find a better reason to deny it, and followed our leader forward amid a chorus of "yes" sounds.</p>
<p>Shixun has a tea addiction, so he took our group to Lian'an Temple. Although the tea here is not as famous as Hupao, the source of the water is one into two and two into one, and the environment is indeed more secluded than Hupao, especially the Nan forests standing respectfully in a line to greet you, which make people linger. When we entered the temple, a receptionist came to greet us. Of course, we had to comment on the fragrant tea here, especially since we were already parched to the extreme. At this time, Shixun continued to talk about the psychology of using a cane in Hangzhou, which was another interesting conversation and worth using as a guide to Hangzhou.</p>
<p>He said, "When people arrive in Hangzhou, in order to achieve their goal of visiting the mountains, as soon as they arrive in Hangzhou, they think that they must prepare a cane in advance, because with it, they can help people when visiting the mountains. In fact, those who secretly take canes have suffered a lot of losses, while the general merchants, peddlers, rickshaw pullers, and boatmen of Hangzhou have gained what they call the "peak season." If you don't believe me, you can try it. If you walk on the lakeside with a cane, there will immediately be a group of rickshaw pullers and boatmen following closely behind you, reciting their slogan-like itineraries, "Sir, do you want a car (or boat) to Lingyin, Hupao, Three Tianzhu, Nine Creeks and Eighteen Streams, Yellow Dragon Cave, Yixia Cave, cheaper price, do you want it?" If you don't firmly say no, they may follow you for more than half a kilometer. If you offer them a price, then you have to continue to be careful that your clothes are not torn apart by their pulling and tearing. As a result, the price you offer, if it is ever agreed upon, will always be more expensive than if you didn't take a cane.</p>
<p>If you are walking on the streets, then the shop assistants, who rely on the one spring for the three winter period, will come up to you and say, "Sir, do you want to buy some fragrant baskets, Buddhist beads, West Lake lotus root powder, fragrant torreya seeds?" If the deal is made, it will also be more expensive than if you didn't take a cane.</p>
<p>In short, the cane in Hangzhou is indeed enough to help people travel, and it is also a trademark for Hangzhou people to field to foreign tourists. On the surface, they are particularly attentive to those who carry canes, but in reality, they want you to lose more, because in Hangzhou, Hangzhou people, or outsiders who have lived in Hangzhou for a long time, except for a few old and frail old men, do not carry canes. Otherwise, you only see three legs on the road all year round. Everything in the world has its advantages and disadvantages. The cane in Hangzhou is one of them." Shixun's words gave us another good lesson for traveling in Hangzhou.</p>

<p>Chapter Twelve Ashamed of Not Having Clothes, Hanging Curtains to Avoid Hardships, Saving Candles, Copying Paintings at Dawn</p>
<p>Cheng Zhiqian said: "In that case, you are a passionate educator. I have a few questions about education in the Northwest that I'd like to discuss with you, old brother. Would you be willing to enlighten me?" These two sentences piqued You Ke's interest, and he didn't want to tutor Bei Hai anymore. The two of them were sitting on opposite sides of the table. He dragged his chair to sit in front of him, rolled up his sleeves, and said, "I can't say 'enlighten me', let's research together. Mr. Cheng has come here to investigate education, why don't you tell me your thoughts first?" Zhiqian said: "It would be too long to talk about the entire education system. Let's talk about a few interesting questions. I went west, all the way to Qinghai and Ningxia. Of course, there's no education to speak of in those places. Let's just say that two or three hundred miles away to the west, I arrived at a county town. This county is very desolate. Standing at a high place, you can see all the rooftops of the houses at a glance, and count them off. But after all, it's a county town, so there must be a school. Outside the gate of an ancient temple, the temple plaque had been removed, and like in the East, there was a school plaque with white characters on a blue background, reading 'Zunzhe County First Elementary School'. At that time, I went inside to visit, and at the temple gate I met a man around thirty years old, wearing a blue cloth jacket and pants, with quite a few ink stains on his body. His head was shaved, without a braid or long hair on the side of his neck. Here, it was determined that he was a student. I said to him, 'I'm here to visit, are you a teacher here?' But his answer was beyond my expectations, he was actually a student here. I also know that students in the Northwest can't be judged by age, but to have such a large age difference was something I didn't believe before I came here." (192)</p>

<p>Arrived in Xuzhou on the 25th morning, warmly welcomed by all sectors; inspected provincial and county schools and gave separate instructions.</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from Xuzhou) Since taking office, Zhou Fo-hai, the Education Commissioner of Jiangsu Province, has personally visited the north and south of Dabie Mountain area to inspect education for the past two years. Recently, he embarked on a trip to Xuzhou and Haizhou. On the 23rd of this month, he set off from Zhenjiang, accompanied by Jian Zhen, the director of the Third Section of the Provincial Education Department, Yi Junzuo, the chief compiler and editor, Zhang Jingshi, a film technician, and Yu Wenwei, a clerk. After a brief stop in Nanjing, they arrived in Xuzhou on the morning of the 25th.

After getting off the train, they immediately entered the city and went to the First Division of the Provincial Xuzhou Middle School located in Beiguan for a rest. After breakfast, they proceeded to inspect the junior high school division of the Second Division, as well as the Xuzhou Experimental Elementary School. He personally visited each classroom, reviewed the teaching methods of the teachers, and inquired in detail about the school's progress. Subsequently, he visited the county library in the park of Kuaizai Pavilion and the Provincial Xuzhou Women's Normal School.

<h3 id="e178">Record of the Sino-Polish Cultural Association <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>You Shou and others elected as directors</p>
<p>The annual meeting of the Sino-Polish Cultural Association was held at 4 p.m. on the 27th in the auditorium of the Ministry of Education. Honorary presidents Cai Yuanpei, Wang Shijie, (Chinese) Wei Dengtao, (Polish), and more than 50 members attended. The proceedings of the meeting are recorded below.</p>
<p>Attendees: Cai Yuanpei, Wang Shijie, Chen Lifu, Zhu Jiahua, Wei Dengtao, Okinsky and his wife, Jin Zumo, Zhang Jiong, Xu Shiqi, Yang Yunhui, Li Jingmi, Jiang Fucong, Lu Sibai, Li Jiaxiang, Yang Manhua, Guo Youshou, Dai Ce, Wu Shuzhang, Chen Panzao, Li Ximou, Xie Shoukang, Chen Mingde, Xu Zhongnian, Ye Guihua, Zhou Gan, Qiu Changkang, Zhang Daofan, Xu Beihong, Li Zhiou, Kong Qingzong, Li Guoxun, Wang Luzeng, Chen Yaodong, Yang Lianggong, Huang Jianzhong, He Zhaoqing, Zhao Zengshou, Deng Jixing, Tang Xueyong, Yu Binglie, Liao Jianan, Hu Shanheng, Wei Xuezhi, Qian Wangzhuo, Yuan Daofeng, Zong Baihua, Lin Donghai, Lin Difen, Zhang Jun, Yuan Junchang, Hang Liwu, Wang Pingling, Gong Zhengtao, Liu Hou, and more than 50 others.</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony: The meeting opened at approximately 4 p.m. After the usual formalities, Honorary President Cai Yuanpei chaired the meeting and delivered an opening speech, briefly stating that the association has been established for two years, and the mutual understanding of the cultures of China and Poland has made progress. Recently, the lectures by Madam Wei Dengtao on the status of Polish women in history and culture, the arrival of the school ship, and the exhibition of product displays, have greatly enlightened us in Poland. We have been very sincere in introducing Poland's literature, music, books, etc., and we have also shared our country's science, education, sports reforms, and artistic characteristics with our friendly countries. Although the association has only been established for two years, it has already achieved a lot in bridging Sino-Polish cultural endeavors. Today's meeting is an opportunity for members to gather together, and it is hoped that there will be closer cooperation between the cultures of the two countries in the future. Guo Youshou then reported on the association's affairs.</p>
<p>Speeches by Representatives: Jin Zumo, representative of the Central Party Headquarters, then delivered a speech, briefly stating that although the Sino-Polish Cultural Association has only been established for two years, it has accomplished more than other cultural associations. This demonstrates the efforts of Sino-Polish members in bridging the cultures of the two countries and is highly admirable. Chinese culture has a long history. Since the era of Emperors Tang and Yu, there has been construction in politics, philosophy, humanities, education, etc. Unfortunately, in later times, people only knew how to worship the ancients and failed to pay attention to innovation, resulting in many shortcomings. During the time of Zeng Wengong, Li Hongzhang, Zhang Zhidong, and others in the late Qing Dynasty, there was already a trend of accepting Western culture. Mr. Sun Yat-sen advocated using scientific methods to organize and promote China's inherent culture and to absorb Western culture in a way that suits the national conditions, which we can use as a guideline. Poland is an emerging country whose artistic expression and political development can be used as a reference for us. The bridging of Sino-Polish culture is worthy of everyone's efforts. Wang Shijie, the representative of the Ministry of Education, then delivered an inquiry, briefly stating that the Sino-Polish Cultural Association has been established for two years. In the past, due to the efforts of each member in working during their busy schedules, much has been done to introduce Sino-Polish culture, and publications have been printed. It is the humble opinion that the union between peoples and nations can be achieved through political, commercial, economic, and cultural aspects. Political unions can often be realized in a very short time through the promotion of influential figures. Unions from commercial and economic aspects also take a short time. However, cultural unions are more difficult and cannot be achieved in a short time. It is necessary to have the majority of people in both countries understand each other, and from understanding to respect, and only with respect can there be close cooperation. Therefore, the time is long, and the matter is complicated. Therefore, it is hoped that the colleagues in this association will work together and recognize that bridging Sino-Polish culture is a permanent or lifelong task. If this is promoted, then nations and nations can understand, respect, and unite with each other.</p>
<p>Reading of Papers: Xie Shoukang then reported that there were a total of eight papers today (titles have been published in the newspapers). Due to time constraints, they could not be discussed in detail, so only the key points were read in Chinese and French. Okinsky then gave a farewell speech, as he would be returning to Poland in three months, briefly stating that in the three and a half years he had been in China, he felt that the Chinese nation was great, with a long history and great culture. The reason why he was able to deeply understand the situation in China during the three and a half years he was in China was largely due to the help of Chinese friends and members of this association. Serving in the transportation sector in China, he felt that Chinese culture had paid attention to transportation as early as 4,000 years ago, especially during the Han Dynasty. Various regions were able to seek practicality based on local needs. The introduction of modern transportation tools was also the result of the Chinese people's own construction efforts. After all, 800 million Chinese people rely on transportation to make a living, so they have to seek adaptation in order to make a living. The speed of modern progress in China may require more time in other countries. He will be leaving China this time after a long time in China. After leaving, he will let the world know the achievements of China's construction efforts. Even in ordinary life, the Chinese principles of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are moral principles that can be adopted by all countries in the world. He has been with everyone for a long time and firmly believes that the bridging of Sino-Polish culture will be successful.</p>
<p>Discussion of Proposals: It was then discussed and proposed to establish a construction committee for the association's premises.

<h3 id="e179">Total Mobilization of the City's Performing Arts Circles on May 1st to Promote Literacy Movement <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau held a symposium with performing arts personnel yesterday, where Director Pan reported on the significance of the literacy movement.</p>
<p>The city's Literacy Education Committee has scheduled a literacy movement propaganda week starting May 1st. The Municipal Education Bureau specially convened a symposium with representatives from the city's performing arts circles at 9 a.m. yesterday, where Director Pan reported that starting May 1st, all performing arts personnel in the city would be fully mobilized to promote the literacy movement. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Representatives: Those present yesterday included Director Pan and Section Chief Jiang of the Municipal Education Bureau, members of the Opera Review Committee, Lü Hailan, Ding Shoutang, Xu Gongwan, Yuan Zengyu, Sun Yucai, Cheng Fengxiang, Peng Quji, as well as representatives from the Shanghai Opera Research Association, the Su Opera Research Association, the Huaji Opera Research Association, the Runyu Society Pingtan Research Association, the Guangyu Society, the Siming Opera Research Association, the Yongyu Society Shanghai Storytelling Research Association, the Weiyang Pinghua Improvement Association, and more than 100 representatives from various drama troupes such as Tianyunlou, Sun Sun Amusement Park, New World, and Fu'an Amusement Park.</p>
<p>Director's Report: Chairman Director Pan reported in brief that the Municipal Education Bureau had invited all personnel from Shanghai's performing arts circles here today to hold a symposium, on the one hand, to discuss improving the performing arts, and on the other hand, to ask everyone to support the literacy movement organized by the city. As everyone knows, the current national environment is becoming increasingly dangerous. To save China, all the people of the country must work together. But to make all the people of the country save the country, they must first understand the danger of the country and the importance of saving the country. To make them understand, in addition to using direct conversations to instruct them, in order to be universally effective, it is necessary to rely on writing. In the past, more than 80% of the Chinese people were illiterate. In recent years, there has been more progress, but still more than 70% are illiterate, with an estimated 300 million or more people being illiterate. How to make them know the country?</p>
<p>Situations in Various Countries: The strength, wealth, and poverty of a country are closely related to literacy. 97% of the Japanese people are literate, so they can become a strong country. Literacy is the foundation of civilization in a country. The citizens of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France are mostly literate. Soviet Russia and Turkey also had more than 80% illiteracy in the past, but since the end of the European War, only seventeen years of effort have resulted in more than 80% of the people being literate. Therefore, Russia's current national power is very different from before, and Turkey has now become an emerging country, erasing the shame of being called the "sick man of the Near East." China has been in revolution for twenty-four years since the revolution, but even if our literate people have made progress, it is only about 10%. According to this proportion, it is not known how many years and months it will take to make more than 80% of the people literate. However, the international situation cannot allow us to wait any longer. We must think of a fast way to make illiterate people literate in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Literacy Movement: Therefore, the central government stipulated seven national salvation movements a few years ago, and the first is the literacy movement, which shows its importance. But it must be done by everyone to be achieved. Therefore, all localities are now promoting the literacy movement. The literacy movement in Shanghai is now being carried out on a large scale and permanently in cooperation with the municipal government, party departments at all levels, agencies, and groups. The municipal government allocates funds to run literacy schools, forcing illiterate people to enroll in the school, reading for two months can recognize 600 to 700 characters, reading for one hour a day, without hindering their work time, free of charge, and books are given away. These literacy schools total about 200, each school has six classes, each class has 50 people, teaching for six hours, totaling 300 people. 200 schools have 60,000 people. Graduates every two months, 360,000 people in twelve months. In this way, after one year, illiterate people can recognize 600 characters. We are compiling a reading material based on these 600 characters, gradually incorporating other new characters, so that they can progress day by day.</p>
<p>Expand Propaganda: This campaign will begin on July 1 this year, but before July 1, we must first make everyone in Shanghai, regardless of men, women, old or young, know that illiterate people are willing to come to study and literate people are willing to come to help. Therefore, there is extensive official propaganda, and it is hoped that everyone in the performing arts circles will do their best to help. The current literacy movement propaganda week runs from May 1st to May 7th. During these seven days, whenever and wherever you have the opportunity to perform or speak, try to insert the meaning of literacy as much as possible. This is helping the country, and May 2nd is designated as Electric Broadcast Propaganda Day. The Broadcasting Industry Association has designated China-West Radio Station to broadcast literacy propaganda programs on this day, and other radio stations will also rebroadcast this program. May 4th is Performing Arts Propaganda Day. On this day, all performing arts personnel in the city will be fully mobilized to promote. The Literacy Education Committee has formulated an outline for everyone to refer to, to make illiterate people willing to become literate and literate people willing to teach illiterate people and not be intellectual slaves. It is hoped that everyone can do their best, which is truly a blessing for the country and the nation.</p>

<h3 id="e184">Secondary School Normal Education Industry Research Association Test Committee to Hold Second Meeting Today <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>2 PM at the Lake Society on Guizhou Road</p>
<p>The first meetings of the various groups of the Municipal Secondary School Normal Education Research Association were held separately last week. The second meeting will be held this week. Today is the second meeting of the graduation examination committee at 2 p.m. at the Lake Society on Guizhou Road to discuss whether to change the calculation and disclosure methods of school examination results and the issue of abolishing the examination. The proposals are recorded below: The proposal to suggest that the government expedite the establishment of a national examination to improve national education and implement educational salvation for national salvation will be submitted to the general assembly for discussion (proposer: Minzhi Elementary School). We humbly believe that the past provincial and municipal examinations have been managed separately, with differences in the strictness of test questions and seals, different methods, and different results. It is difficult to unify the level of education and it is not easy to distinguish between the superior and inferior. Therefore, in order to implement the national education improvement policy and improve overall planning in order to control it, a national examination should be expedited. Secondly, if the examination policies are inconsistent, it is difficult to investigate which of the outstanding talents who have been selected in each session are in which place, who they are, how many there are, and what their level is. It is difficult to investigate the great size of the country. The country has no way to reward and cultivate them in order to store up resources for national salvation. If a national examination can be held, the selected and distinguished people can be treated with special courtesy and cultivated through government funding. Military training and education can be carried out in conjunction with each other, and the wise and brave who are selected can serve the country together to complete the revolution and revive the nation. Therefore, in order to implement educational salvation, a national examination should be expedited. Thirdly, there are many subjects, which have already been mentally taxing, and the scope is too broad, making exploration even more difficult, causing students to spend a long time preparing, suffering and searching blindly. Students with weaker bodies often get sick before the test, miss all or part of the test, and are unable to graduate, or get sick and miss classes before the test, and cannot prepare urgently after the illness, resulting in failure. Also, there are often hereditary diseases, which can cause nervous disorders and incurable diseases due to excessive use of the brain, which is harmful. If a national examination can be held, there will be a prescribed scope, and students will not need to waste their brains on preparations outside the prescribed scope. Therefore, for the sake of students' health and development, a national examination should be expedited. Fourthly, the books used in different places and schools are different, and there are many subjects and a wide range, making it difficult for teachers and students to teach and learn. Moreover, there are many kinds of reference books for each subject, with varying degrees of detail, making students sigh with hope and have no idea where to start. Teachers have difficulty finding a basis for selecting supplementary teaching materials, and guidance is therefore uncertain, and it is difficult to avoid the criticism of blind men riding blind horses. Therefore, in order to avoid wasting time and energy for teachers and students in middle schools across the country, to put teaching and learning on the right track, to achieve national unity, and to increase efficiency, a national examination should be expedited. As for the method of national examination, as far as we can see, one is that the teaching materials are nationally fixed, and the textbooks are edited and distributed by the central government or the Ministry of Education and sold in bookstores, or they are selected by the state and uniformly adopted throughout the country, or the examination outlines of various subjects are compiled and printed by the Suzhou Education Bureau, so that the national education control policy can be implemented, the academic thinking of students can be summarized, and the disadvantages of having no standard range can be avoided, and the benefits of achieving twice the result with half the effort can be achieved. Second, the examination administration should be unified, and the national examination of each subject should be held on the same day at the same time. The test questions should be prepared by the Examination Yuan and the Ministry of Education, and the whole country should be unified. Third, the security should be strict, and the proctors should be dispatched by the Yuan and the Ministry, and the examiners should be transferred from various provinces and cities to avoid them. Finally, the Ministry of Education should sum up the examination questions and test papers, and the highest party and government officials of the central government and various provinces and cities should follow the bank's management method to jointly open and close them to show solemnity. The examination room should be extremely solemn to avoid cheating and unfairness. Fourth, the school spirit should be changed to innovation. The national examination questions should be raised and increased as much as possible within the possible range. In addition to setting the minimum standard for ordinary passing grades, the degree to which they exceed them should not be limited so that students with excellent grades can fully express their knowledge, just as there are records and new records in sports, so that students in various provinces and cities can strive to make progress and compete for championships. Not only will the academic level be invisibly improved, but the national school spirit will also be greatly changed, washing away the current abundance of stagnation, negativity, decline, and licentiousness. Fifth, rewards and prevention of abuses. Outstanding graduates who have been selected through the national examination should be sent to national, provincial, and municipal schools or famous private schools with corresponding subjects, and all tuition, food, accommodation, and travel expenses should be waived so that they can further their studies and be stored for national use. Also, students who have passed the national examination should be given a transcript, and they should only be selected for any school based on the examination results, and they should not be allowed to take the examination again. After the implementation of the national examination, the enrollment of all national, provincial, and municipal public schools should be announced and reported at the same time. All lists of admitted and unadmitted students should be reported in order to prevent the abuse of taking non-talented people and to achieve the benefit of equal educational opportunities for the country. Academic and practical skills should be given equal importance, and the tests for various subjects should also include experiments, dissections, surveying, and technical skills in order to avoid overemphasizing academic theory and being impractical. Too much use of the brain will lead to imbalance and hinder health. The above-mentioned reasons and methods for the government to expedite the examination, whether it is appropriate, please make a public decision, which is really convenient for the public.</p>

<h3 id="e185">The First China-Portugal Cup Match: China Defeats Portugal 5-3; Sun Jinshun Scores Three Consecutive Goals; The Performance of China's New Players Is Satisfactory <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese and Portuguese teams, who met in this year's All China Cup football tournament, met again yesterday at Zhongyuan for the first match of this year's China-Portugal Cup. The Portuguese team's lineup remained the same, while the Chinese team, due to the return of the Donghua team from their Korean tour, was mainly composed of the runner-up of the Western League's Group A, Youyou, with the addition of new players from the youth team such as Xu Jingcheng and Fu Zhibin. Their fighting strength remained extremely strong. In the first half, the Portuguese team suffered due to poor line control and weak interior defense, allowing China to take a 4-1 lead. Although they adjusted their troops and tried their best to defend, it was too late to recover, and China won 5-3 in the end. Due to the cloudy weather, there were about 4,000 to 5,000 spectators.</p>
<p>Do Not Make a Preemptive Move</p>
<p>Not long after the start of the game, China conceded the first goal. The new and old players lacked coordination in their first collaboration. Fortunately, Sun Jinshun and Zhong Yongsen worked particularly hard, and the frontline offense was very strong. Xu Wenkui and Fu Zhibin had reached perfection. Luo Douwen was timid and weak, slow in running, and rarely contributed. The central defenders Liang Shutang and Xu Jingcheng were both very outstanding. Yun Fengwu was not as good as before, just mediocre. The inner defense relied entirely on Jiang Shanqing, while Zheng Zhiyun lacked experience and repeatedly let enemies pass, which was very dangerous. Zhang Rongcai was calm and commendable, with unlimited potential. China took advantage of the opponent's internal weakness and scored four consecutive goals, establishing a solid foundation. Although the Portuguese team changed their strategy and tried their best to counterattack, they ultimately failed.</p>
<p>Portuguese Army Poor Distribution</p>
<p>The mediocrity of the Portuguese team's goalkeeper and inner defense was the main reason for their defeat. The two defenders, F. Mashan Brother and Victor, were useless, with almost no ability to block. They lost one goal after another, causing great pain. Later, L. Mashan Son and Remydi were transferred to the rear, and the defense became impregnable, leaving the Chinese athletes with no chance. The forwards, such as Corassa, had no worries about the rear and their offensive was also fierce. In the second half, China spent more time defending and less time attacking. In the end, the Portuguese team's poor shooting and frequent missed opportunities, as well as the incompetence of the two wings, inevitably diminished their performance.</p>
<p>Zhiyun's Misstep Is Regrettable</p>
<p>Referee Chen Jixiang ordered the Chinese team to kick off. Zhong Yongsen crossed twice, but Sun Jinshun's header was inaccurate. The Portuguese army, led by Mashan Son and Guanshifu, broke through the siege. Zheng Zhiyun was absent-minded and made a mistake in blocking, almost causing an accident. In a hurry, Mashan Son shot, but fortunately it was unintentionally blocked by Zhang Rongcai. Xu Wenkui once penetrated deeply, but the attack was weak. The Portuguese army attacked again, and Zheng Zhiyun's misstep caused trouble. Natao got a chance to attack and scored the first goal, ten minutes after the start of the game.</p>
<p>Immediately Recover the Lost Ground</p>
<p>The center kicked off, and China went all out. Zhong Yongsen sent a corner kick, Xu Wenkui headed back, and Fu Zhibin pulled up a kick, immediately recovering the lost ground, making it 1-1. The Chinese situation was revitalized. In less than two minutes, Sun and Fu cooperated to break through the formation. At a suitable point, Sun's iron foot shot at the goal without hesitation. The ball brushed the goalpost and went in. The Portuguese goalkeeper lay on the ground trying to save it but was too late. China then took a 2-1 lead. The Portuguese army was extremely dissatisfied and at a loss. It was entirely the world of the Chinese athletes. Fu Zhibin single-handedly raided the camp and shot the ball, which was a pity.</p>
<p>Old Sun Scores Two More Goals</p>
<p>Sun Jinshun received the ball from Fu Yongbin's left corner, rushed to the goal, and the enemy defenders rushed out but did not return. Old Sun straightened his chest, and the enemy's goal fell again. At this point, China had won 3-1. Then, Jiang Shanqing kicked a free kick on the center line, shooting towards the left side. Xu Wenkui headed, and Old Sun intercepted it. When the ball was still in the air, Old Sun used his iron leg to hook and shoot at the goal. The ball flew into the goal, beautiful and unparalleled. Seeing the weakness of the inner defense, the Portuguese army immediately transferred the generals Mashan Son and Remydi to defend the rear, creating deep trenches and high barriers. China could not use its strength, and the situation suddenly changed. Fafan怯得球远射,The ball rolled rapidly on the ground, Zhang Rongcai couldn't save it, and lost a goal, making the first half 4-2, with China winning.</p>
<p>Little Xu Also Captures a City</p>
<p>After the lemon break, both sides regrouped. Xu Wenkui came out unexpectedly, dribbling the ball quickly. Zhong and Fu assisted from the left and right. Little Xu shouted, and the ball had already entered the goal, making China win 5-2. From then on, the Portuguese town's defense became more strict. Mashan Son and Remydi took care of the left and right sides, and Gu Sitan gave birth to Zhongyuan, making it impossible for the Chinese athletes to penetrate into dangerous places. Over time, the Chinese forwards were exhausted, and the offensive became weaker. Instead, Portugal was eager to retaliate and worked hard to counterattack. In front of the Chinese goal, it was extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>The Portuguese Army Could Not Recover</p>
<p>The Portuguese team's forwards besieged endlessly, and the generals Liang, Jiang, Lu, and Xu blocked from left and right, unable to cope. In the drizzle, Corassa also disregarded the muddy ground and kicked hard. Jiang Shanqing stepped forward to defend, aiming correctly. The ball bounced off Jiang's body, and Luo Liu 加鞭赶上, and shot smoothly, Zhang Rongcai was caught off guard and watched it enter, making it 5-3. After that, the swords and spears came and went, and the momentum gradually weakened. The Chinese front line could hardly cross the center line. Although the Portuguese team was still actively attacking, it was like the end of a strong crossbow, achieving nothing. The Portuguese left wing once sent a high ball in front of the goal, but the right wing's shot missed. This ball was very dangerous. The bugle sounded to end the war, and in the end, China won 5-3.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Weihua of the Chinese Football Association's Middle Character Group played against Fudan at the Xianshi Stadium. Both teams were very strong, and the outcome was related to the championship, so the battle was very fierce. In the end, Weihua won 3-1, winning the Middle Character Group championship. Although Weihua still has one game against Zhenru, the outcome is irrelevant to the championship.</p>
<p>Zhou Shaowen Scores the First Goal: At the stroke of three o'clock, the referee Zhang Le sounded the order, and the fight began. The Fudan team was strong and robust, and launched a large-scale attack, which was rescued by the Weihua defense. In less than two minutes, Fudan's Zhou Shaowen kicked the ball from 17 yards away from the goal, and it went straight in.</p>
<p>Deng Zhiyang Equalizes: After conceding a goal, the Weihua players worked hard to fight back. Once, the Fudan goalkeeper fouled by taking four steps and was penalized with a free kick. Weihua's Ma Wenjun kicked hard, and the ball landed in the hands of the Fudan goalkeeper, who did not hold it far, and Deng Zhiyang gently pushed it in, resulting in a tie. The first half ended one-one.</p>
<p>Zhu Caixin Single-Handedly Scores a Goal: After changing sides, Fudan seemed to show signs of weakness. Jin Shunzhang repeatedly led his troops to attack, but Weihua's Shao Yougong, Wu Jialu, Zhang Guanjin, etc. defended effectively, and they repeatedly failed. After twenty minutes, Zhu Caixin, with the help of Cao Chuyun, single-handedly kicked in a goal.</p>
<p>Tan Guofang Scores Another Goal: At this point, Fudan changed from attack to defense. Weng Renan was in charge of the center, providing effective delivery, but he was often too hasty, and ultimately ineffective. Weihua's Tan Guofang kicked in a goal from 30 yards away, making it three to one. Weihua celebrated its victory.</p>

<p>St. Francis Takes the Lead 2-1 in the First Half; Starlight Reverses the Defeat to Win 6-3</p>
<p>Starlight and St. Francis of the Western League's E Group had equal scores, so they played a final at Shenyuan Stadium yesterday morning at 10:00 AM to determine who would win the championship. The situation was very plain, but both sides' offense and defense were very balanced. In the first half, St. Francis took a 2-1 lead. In the second half, Starlight gave it their all, and their luck turned, scoring five goals one after another. In the end, Starlight reversed the defeat to win 6-3.</p>
<p>First Half: Starlight kicked off and attacked first, but was intercepted halfway. St. Francis took the opportunity to attack, coming fiercely. In addition, Starlight faced the wind, so they were under pressure. The ball was constantly hovering in front of the Starlight goal. After ten minutes, St. Francis' Corassa got the ball and crossed it, and Koumani ran up and kicked the ball into the upper right corner. Not long after, Starlight's Liu Shiqing detoured and infiltrated, breaking through the enemy's goal, creating a 1-1 situation. Afterwards, the offense and defense of both sides were quite fierce, and they were deadlocked for a long time. The St. Francis center forward attacked the goal, and the Starlight goalkeeper slapped the ball out, but Koumani added another kick, and it was impossible to save. At the end of the first half, St. Francis took a 2-1 lead.</p>
<p>Second Half: Starlight gave it their all and tried to cheer up. Xue Yongyuan dribbled the ball deep and shot from 12 yards away, flying into the upper right corner of the goal, creating a 2-2 tie again. Once, Xue Yongyuan dribbled the ball close to the enemy's goal, and St. Francis' inner defender Raig hurriedly resisted, but accidentally pushed the ball into his own net. From then on, Starlight's luck came. Lin Qingchi headed and kicked, and Xue Yongyuan shot from a distance, killing the barbarian army and leaving them with no way out. At the end of the game, St. Francis got a penalty kick opportunity and pulled back a goal. In the end, Starlight reversed the defeat to win 6-3.</p>

<h3 id="e189">Baihong Sports Meet Results <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Chen Baoqiu Made No Progress</p>
<p>The Baihong team, which won the International Seven Group Overall Championship, held its own sports meet at Hongkou Park at 2:30 PM yesterday. Because this time was to review the results of all the members, most of the athletes who participated in the previous Seven Games did not participate in the competition. The Monkey King watched from the sidelines with his suitcase.</p>
<p>The Iron Bull's Throw Was Unsatisfactory: The Iron Bull Chen Baoqiu came to the venue with his beautiful girl, carrying his own golden sixteen-pound treasure. He showed his skills, but because there were too few people participating in this game, he was not interested. He threw it casually and it was very unsatisfactory. The first throw was only 11.13 meters, the second throw was 11.48 meters, and the third throw was only 11.89 meters, which was far from his national record of 12.69 meters. It is said that the Iron Bull's recent results have not improved much. Sometimes he can exceed 13 meters, and sometimes it is difficult to exceed 12 meters. This is probably due to the environment in Hankou.</p>
<p>Gu Huiyuan's Start Was Excellent: Yesterday, there were six track events and three field events. In terms of track events, Chen Baolin gave the order, Kang Zhao recorded, and Kang Taiming recorded the field events. Among them, Wang Yongmin's sprint was more remarkable. Gu Huiyuan's start in the 800-meter race was extremely excellent. Although his score of two minutes and twenty seconds and one was only mediocre, he was 30 to 40 meters ahead of the first place when he reached the finish line, and his reasonable start was deeply exemplary. The results of each item are recorded below.</p>
<p>Item, First Place, Second Place, Third Place, Result</p>
<p>100 Meters, Wang Yongmin, Zhu Hongqi, Yi Xiong, 11.6 Seconds</p>
<p>200 Meters, Wang Yongmin, Zhu Hongqi, Wang Siyuan, 24.2 Seconds</p>
<p>400 Meters, Zhu Ruihong, Chen Mingliang, Dai Jiaju, 57.6 Seconds</p>
<p>800 Meters, Gu Huiyuan, Tu Baojun, Tong Gan Yu, 2 Minutes 20.1 Seconds</p>
<p>1500 Meters, Bao Qinbi, Zhou Zhicheng, Chen Jian, 4 Minutes 39 Seconds</p>
<p>5000 Meters, Wan Jinsheng, Wang Rulin, Liang Yaoting, 18 Minutes 6.6 Seconds</p>
<p>Shot Put, Chen Baoqiu, Shen Weishan, Bao Jialiang, 11.89 Meters</p>
<p>Pole Vault, Zhu Hong, 2.80 Meters</p>
<p>Long Jump, Zhu Hongqi, Wang Siyuan, Zhu Hong, 5.82 Meters</p>
<p>Many Athletes Departed from Shanghai: Baihong athletes Liu Changchun, Leng Peigen, Li Shiming and others left Shanghai yesterday at 1:10 PM by the Beijing-Shanghai Joint Transport Express train after coming to Shanghai the day before to participate in the Seven Games. Thirteen members of the Baihong Suzhou Branch, led by Gan Jinguan, also returned to Suzhou on the same train. Among them, Liu and Leng returned to the capital to report for duty. Li Shiming will stay in Beijing for two or three days before heading north to return to Ping, and the wound on his leg has burst and is slightly more serious than before, but the overall situation is fine. Tie Niu Cheng Baoqiu met with his friend yesterday and said that he is scheduled to return to Hankou by ship on the 2nd of next month, or take a car to Beijing first, stay for a few days, and then take a ship from Beijing. Because they are limited by the All China Games regulations, they must be residents for at least six months before they can show their skills. They have to wait until the Double Tenth National Games to see their heroic appearance again.</p>

<h3 id="e194">New Ways to Develop Export Trade (Continued) <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Kong Dian</p>
<p>Speaking further from the perspective of trade finance, the urgent need is equally felt. The rise and fall of foreign exchange business invariably shifts with the development of the trade industry. The main source of profit for exchange banks lies in discounting import and export bills. Therefore, the close relationship between the two is like that of lips and teeth. It is inconceivable that banks engaged in foreign exchange can maintain profits on their own when trade shrinks. Consequently, traders rely on foreign exchange banks for the movement of funds for their import and export goods, which is enough to control their business life. The credit risks associated with export trade also have a significant impact on the exchange banks themselves. If these risks can somehow be managed so that foreign exchange banks do not bear part of the responsibility, they will naturally dare to take bold steps and provide exporters with financing facilities in a simple and convenient manner.</p>
<p>The settlement of payments in import and export trade is mostly done through documentary bills. When foreign exchange banks purchase documentary bills, they usually use documentary letters of credit to prevent any unforeseen risks. Because the issuing bank of the letter of credit assumes the guarantee responsibility, they are happy to purchase them, handing over the amount specified on the bill to the holder. Otherwise, who would be willing to inquire? However, since the issuing bank assumes this guarantee responsibility, it will inevitably charge the importer, who is the client, a certain issuing fee or other acceptance fee as special compensation. In this way, the importer will feel that the burden is too heavy and will not dare to import goods rashly, which will create obstacles to export trade.</p>
<p>To eliminate the above-mentioned obstacles and allow a country's export trade to proceed smoothly, the only way is to implement export credit insurance. However, in terms of technology, measuring risks in this system is very difficult. If it is run by private individuals, it is feared that their financial resources will be insufficient. Therefore, most countries today take on this responsibility through the government. The following is a brief description of the experiences of countries such as England and Germany in handling this matter.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>The export credit insurance system originated in England. In 1919, the British Board of Trade studied the reasons for the decline in trade with Central Europe and concluded that it was due to the financial difficulties of exporters. Therefore, on September 20 of that year, the Overseas Trade Act was promulgated, with the Treasury allocating £25 million, up to 80% of the value of the goods, specifically for lending to merchants engaged in export trade. Although this law provided exporters with temporary financing convenience, it still lacked guarantees for export bills and insurance for credit risks. Therefore, after consultation with the Federation of National Chambers of Commerce, the law was revised, and the Overseas Trade Credit Insurance Amendment Act was promulgated in June 1921. A special department was set up within the Board of Trade to manage it. For export bills issued by exporters when selling goods to overseas merchants, with a term of less than one year, the government would guarantee the full amount of the bill. For terms exceeding one year, the limit was 85%. At the same time, it was stipulated that the government retained the right of recourse for 57.5% from the exporter in the former case and 42.5% in the latter. The scope of application was initially limited to countries in Central and Southern Europe, but later expanded to India, Ceylon, and the Far East. By 1925, all goods exported overseas, except to Soviet Russia, could be insured. At the same time, the government convened a committee in July 1925, composed of national industrialists, bankers, and insurance officials, to discuss (1) the benefits of export credit insurance for export trade; (2) whether the government needs to take other measures to supplement existing benefits; and (3) if necessary, what specific methods should be adopted. After research, the committee submitted the following opinions in March of the following year:</p>
<p>(1) Credit insurance is essential for healthy export trade.</p>
<p>(2) The current system still cannot meet the demands of exporters.</p>
<p>(3) The government should find ways to expand the current system without causing excessive trading.</p>
<p>Therefore, the government was recommended to formulate three measures, namely:</p>
<p>A. For bills issued by exporters, if they are of the Without Recourse type (i.e., the drawer has no right of recourse), the government will provide a guarantee of up to 75% of the face value. In other words, if the overseas importer who is responsible for payment refuses to pay in the future, the bank that discounted the bill can request repayment of the guaranteed amount and seek it from the exporter by other means.</p>
<p>B. Conversely, for bills issued by exporters, if they are of the (With full recourse) type (i.e., the drawer is obliged to repay the face value), the government will guarantee the full amount of the face value. At first glance, exporters seem to have no insurance benefits at all because they are obliged to repay the full amount of the bill. However, after the bill is guaranteed by the government, it can be discounted by the bank without having to provide additional collateral, which is indeed very convenient.</p>
<p>C. With reference to the above two, for bills issued by exporters, either (Without recourse) or after consultation with the insurance authorities regarding the extent of their repayment obligation, the government will guarantee all or part of the face value as they wish.</p>
<p>The government implemented this proposal in July 1926, and in 1927, it expanded the business of the insurance department, allowing exporters to agree with the insurance department to target all their importing partners and establish a comprehensive insurance contract, setting a guarantee limit. When issuing documentary bills, they would notify the insurance department to guarantee them within the set limit. If the exporter does not issue bills or the amount of bills issued is very small, the government may refund part of the insurance premium already paid.</p>
<p>The most common contracts between exporters and the government now are two types: one is that after the exporter pays the insurance premium, if the documentary bills issued are rejected by importers in other countries, the government will compensate 75% of the face value; the other is to provide the exporter's bank with an unconditional payment guarantee for a certain amount, which is particularly convenient for exporters to obtain financing. The guarantee period varies depending on the type of goods, with a maximum of five years for machinery and a minimum of only six months for piece goods. This system has been in operation for over fifteen years. It was originally scheduled to end at the end of 1935, but in the current environment where the world economy has not yet escaped the panic, there is no doubt that this effective method of revitalizing trade will continue to be implemented.</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>Following England, Germany was the next to use export credit insurance as a strategy to revitalize overseas trade. Private insurance companies in Germany, such as Hermes Kreditversicherungsbank and Frankfurter Allgeneine Versicherungsgesellschaft, used to insure the risks of export bills, but the high fees made it ineffective. Therefore, in 1922, the government began to cooperate with Hermes, first with a fund of 30 million marks, to launch long-term export credit insurance to Russia in 1922. Subsequently, it was gradually increased, and by 1927, it was extended to other countries. The method is that when the exporter ships the goods to the foreign buyer, they can use the bill of lading as evidence and apply for insurance to the insurance company. The insurance company, after retaining a portion, can reinsure half of its insured amount with the Export Kredit-Versicherung-Stelle established by the government, with the state as the reinsurer. If the price of the goods cannot be recovered in the future and the loss is too large, the excess will be fully compensated by the government. Therefore, not only do exporters have this guarantee to sign export credit insurance contracts as their only defensive weapon, but insurance companies also do not hesitate regardless of which merchant the goods are sold to or the excessive amount of insurance. Moreover, after insuring, if the exporter mortgages the insurance policy to the bank, the insurance company can certify that it will pay the compensation to the bank holding the policy in the event of a loss. In this way, in one transfer, the exporter's turnover of export funds is not only not subject to the government's previous loans, but they can also collect the goods with ease.</p>
<p>In addition to England and Germany, Sweden, Norway, Italy, and Austria have also followed suit. In May 1930, Japan enacted this type of insurance under the name of the Export Compensation Law, stipulating that for domestic goods exported to designated areas overseas, if the bank purchases the issued documentary bills and suffers losses due to non-performance of the insurance, the bank will pay a certain compensation fee, and the government will compensate 70% of its losses. It has been implemented for over five years, and its export trade has been expanding day by day. Although there are many reasons for this, export credit insurance is undoubtedly an important factor in promoting this trend.</p>
<p>Looking back at our country, to this day, the domestic economic situation is gradually becoming depleted due to the continuous increase in annual import surpluses and the outflow of cash. In the future, to prevent economic collapse and balance international payments, the development of overseas trade should be taken as the only prerequisite. The government should first follow the established examples of various countries and implement export credit insurance, so that merchants engaged in export can rest assured that their goods are shipped and sold abroad, and provide buyers with long-term credit facilities. In this way, foreign importers will naturally be happy to purchase our country's products. By doing this, the quantity of imported goods will be more than offset by the increase in exports, so why worry about the imbalance of international borrowing? However, today in our country, there are only one or two overseas exchange banks, and they have all been established recently. They lack sufficient experience in investigating overseas market conditions, and there are few who are directly engaged in export trade. Not to mention that in this time of financial constraints, the government is powerless to do so, and even if it spends huge sums of money and takes risks, the effect is still questionable. In our humble opinion, since the world economy is still groaning under the tide of panic, it is practically impossible for our country to increase exports for a while. For the present, it is better to first abolish various obstacles in domestic trade, such as transit taxes and part of the business tax, as soon as possible, so that domestic products can reduce costs and circulate freely. Then unnecessary foreign goods will naturally be ignored. With our country's natural advantages, why worry that it cannot be self-sufficient! (The End)</p>
<h3 id="e195">Two Paths of Today's World Economy <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Cihang</p>
<p>Today's world economy is clearly divided into two major groups: those maintaining the gold standard and those having abandoned it. The former group claims that the revival of the world economy lies in the resumption of the gold standard by the latter group. The latter group argues that the recovery of global prosperity requires the gold standard group to temporarily abandon it as well, and collectively work towards raising world prices. These two major groups have engaged in heated debates over these two opposing paths, even at the previous World Economic Conference, and it remains the biggest problem in the world. In theory, which of these two paths is the correct one? Many world economists are constantly discussing it. In reality, which path is the world's economy heading towards today? People all over the world are watching intently. A Washington dispatch on April 21st reported that the United States is preparing to convene another World Economic Conference within the next six months to discuss this issue.</p>
<p>Our country is currently experiencing an economic panic, with the situation becoming increasingly serious. However, our economic panic is not something we created ourselves; it is indeed a product of the global economic panic. Although the United States' silver purchase policy is sufficient to fuel our economic panic and accelerate its realization, the occurrence of our economic panic is not entirely the result of the U.S. silver purchase. If the United States did not purchase silver, would we encounter the same difficulties? I think the timing might be sooner or later, but the calamity of the panic would probably be difficult to avoid! Because currency devaluation competition among countries would also gradually raise the external price of our silver currency, leading to the same result of monetary contraction. Therefore, we are now, like the gold standard countries, also wavering on the diverging roads of two paths. One is to adhere to our silver standard, patiently hoping and waiting for the arrival of global prosperity, or a change in the U.S. silver purchase policy. The other is to ban silver exports, suspend cash payments, inflate the currency, break away from the shackles of the world economy, and let the price of the national currency plummet.</p>
<p>However, whether in China or the world, both of the aforementioned possible paths are fraught with thorns and danger, so neither is a good option. Therefore, everyone is hesitating and wavering, wandering on the diverging roads, unable to move forward or retreat, forming a stalemate of shifting from left to right. Now let us put aside theory and observe the actual effects of the economic policies adopted by major countries under this panic situation based on actual statistical figures. The facts tell us that countries that have lowered their currency prices have made relatively significant progress in saving the panic and restoring the market. For example, if we study the characteristics of world trade in 1934, the trade of countries with currency devaluation, such as the United States, Britain, and Japan, has indeed significantly recovered, while the trade of countries maintaining the gold standard, such as France and Germany, has been shrinking day by day and still tending towards decline. Although various measures hindering the progress of world trade, such as exchange controls, tariff increases, import restrictions, and import bans, were prevalent in various countries last year, the trade of countries with lower exchange rates, especially Britain and the United States, has gradually recovered to the state of 1931; Japan's progress is particularly rapid, having broken the trade figures of 1928 and 1929. On the other hand, among the European countries, such as France, exports and imports are only tending to decline; although Germany has been striving to improve the trade balance, the result is still a decline in exports and an increase in imports, with the years of trade surplus having transformed into a trade deficit.</p>
<p>Britain's imports last year were £732.2 million, an increase of £57 million compared to 1933. Exports were £447 million, an increase of £30 million. The import surplus was £285.2 million, an increase of £27 million compared to 1933, but a decrease of over £100 million compared to 1932. That is, under the condition of increased import and export trade, the import surplus has been reduced, indicating that its domestic economic situation has improved. Last year, the United States had imports of $1.6555 billion and exports of $2.134 billion, an increase of $100.5 million in imports and $459 million in exports compared to 1933. The export surplus was $479 million, more than double the increase compared to 1933 ($215 million in 1933), the highest record since 1930. Last year, Japan had imports of 2.313 billion yuan, an increase of 363 million yuan. Exports were 2.2 billion yuan, an increase of 330 million yuan. The import surplus was 123 million yuan, an increase of 44.4 million yuan compared to 1933.</p>
<p>Although the state of trade progress in the above three countries, Britain, the United States, and Japan, each has its special conditions, such as the extraordinary increase in trade between Britain and Canada, South Africa, Australia, India, and the three Scandinavian countries as a result of the Ottawa Conference, as well as the United States' efforts in the development of the South American market and Japan's focus on the invasion of the Manchurian market, these are also reasons for their trade growth, the devaluation of currency in each country is indeed a common and major reason. Because in politics, although there are relationships of territories and colonies, in economics, it is necessary to look at the actual commercial conditions. For example, if a country's currency is of high value, then the people of the territory and colony will inevitably switch directions to purchase cheaper foreign goods, and they cannot simply use political power to force the people of the territory and colony to love and use domestic goods. Because this kind of coercion is ineffective.</p>
<p>June and July of 1932 were the worst times for the world economy. At that time, industrial productivity fell by 30% compared to 1929, prices plummeted, unemployment increased, the countryside declined, and the phenomenon of economic panic permeated the globe. Government authorities and economists in various countries were racking their brains, anxiously trying to find ways to save the situation. After countless rounds of heated debate, they finally decided to adopt a kind of gradual monetary inflation policy, which was to devalue their own currency in order to open up sales channels for surplus products. After doing this for two or three years, prices gradually increased, unemployment decreased, and all economic conditions tended toward recovery. However, the progress of this recovery was very slow. Especially in the United States, their government spent millions of dollars on revival, but the achievements were very symbolic. What is the reason for this? According to the observation of world-renowned economist Professor Cassel, it is blamed on European countries such as France and Germany for reluctantly maintaining the gold standard, creating a state of domestic contraction. Because the markets of countries maintaining the gold standard still tend to be depressed, which also prevents the markets of countries that have abandoned the gold standard from advancing vigorously and recovering. Therefore, he advocates that gold standard countries such as France and Germany should also temporarily abandon the gold standard, and negotiate with countries such as Britain, the United States, and Japan on the parity of currencies between countries, reduce the fineness of gold coins, and restore the gold standard at the same time. In short, his opinion is that only by reducing the fineness of gold coins in various countries can the world economy be restored.</p>
<p>At present, the world's currency system can be roughly divided into two types: gold-group currency and paper currency-group currency. Although the United States and Germany seem close to the gold group, they are actually not members of the gold group. The gold group strongly advocates restoring the gold standard according to the original statutory parity. The paper money group advocates first restoring the usual relationship between prices and production costs, and then stabilizing the currency's purchasing power over goods. In other words, it advocates raising overall prices first, and then engaging in stabilization. The currency policy of the United Kingdom is representative of the latter. Now many paper money countries' currencies use the pound sterling as the standard, following its rise and fall. British territories and countries such as Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Argentina are all members of the pound sterling group. The Japanese exchange rate has always followed the pound sterling, and now our country's gold unit is also calculated according to the pound sterling. Secondly, the power of the US dollar group is also very strong. Therefore, according to the current situation, the power of the gold group such as France is very small: it is definitely not as great as the power of the paper currency group. Moreover, according to economic theory, it is easier for a country's currency to depreciate than to appreciate. Now the currencies of various paper group countries have already fallen to 60%, 50%, or 40% of their original value, and the United States has openly reduced the fineness of gold dollars in law, indicating that it has no intention of lifting the ban at the old parity. Therefore, in fact, trying to get the paper group to accommodate the gold group is something that cannot be done. Moreover, the countries in the paper group have now achieved the practical effect of improving trade and restoring the economy by using the method of currency devaluation. Seeing that the gold group countries are all sinking into monetary contraction, falling prices, and depressed industries, they are not willing to quickly restore the gold standard and repeat their mistakes. Moreover, the world's prices have not yet reached the level desired by the paper group countries. They are still actively carrying out various economic revival methods to raise prices. If these are ineffective, or if the effectiveness is very slight, they also seem to not hesitate to sacrifice further and reduce the value of their currency. Therefore, not only do they have no intention of accommodating the gold group, but they also believe that the gold group is the biggest obstacle to the world's economic recovery. The reason why world prices cannot actively rise is because of the gold group's drag. Various efforts of the paper group countries to restore the economy have been discounted in effect and reduced in color due to the existence of the gold group. Therefore, they say that if the world is to quickly return to the road to prosperity, then unless the gold group countries also abandon the gold standard at the same time.</p>
<p>The countries in the gold group were originally France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany, etc., with France as the leader, but now the members of the group have also moved. After the Great War, due to the wasteland of agricultural affairs and the increase in import surplus, the French government issued huge amounts of public debt to revive the war zone. Therefore, the French currency began to plummet wildly from 1919, becoming unbearable. The people suffered the pain of currency inflation. It was not until June 1928 that the gold content of the French franc was reduced by 80% and the gold standard was restored. At that time, some people said that the price of the French franc had fallen too much. However, France's trade developed because of this, and at that time, countries such as Britain and the United States caused a state of contraction. How would they know that after three years, the situation changed, and countries such as Britain and the United States successively abandoned the gold standard in order to avoid the state of contraction, which in turn created a state of contraction for France and other countries. As the currencies of the paper group and other countries depreciated day by day, the currencies of the gold group and other countries appreciated day by day. In other words, the more the paper group's currency depreciated, the more expensive the price of the gold group's currency calculated in the paper group's currency. This expensiveness is not natural, but because the gold group's currency can be exchanged for cash, following the rise and fall of cash. The depreciation of the paper group's currency against cash is the depreciation against the gold group's currency, so the higher the price of gold, the higher the gold group's currency, and the more difficult it is for the gold group to maintain the gold standard. Because everyone thinks that the evaluation of the gold group's currency is too expensive, they will naturally abandon the gold group's currency to exchange cash, silver goods and paper currencies of paper group countries. The factual manifestation of this abandonment is cash payment, squeeze, cash outflow, or hoarding, reducing the reserve of banknotes day by day. If the gold group country cannot cope, it will be forced to abandon the gold standard. Now the gold standard countries are always in this dangerous and uneasy state. The countries in the paper group indirectly accepted major influences. The world's economy is therefore difficult to recover quickly, and trade is therefore difficult to develop rationally.</p>
<p>Indeed, the current evaluation of gold group currency is too great. According to the statistics of September 1934, the percentage of gold group currency to the pound sterling is as follows: that is, the Belgian currency is 7% more expensive than the pound sterling, Italy is 13% more expensive, France is 17% more expensive, the Netherlands is 12% more expensive, Switzerland is 41% more expensive, and Germany is 57% more expensive. This is indeed an extremely unnatural state. If the gold group countries do not take the simultaneous devaluation method, trying to use exchange controls, trade control, and other measures to hinder international trade to prevent the dumping of paper group countries is a counter-current movement, and the result must be failure.</p>
<p>The London Economic Magazine published an article by British economist Mr. Strachey-Galsworthy in January of this year. He also said that to restore world prosperity, countries around the world must simultaneously reduce the fineness of gold coins and restore the gold standard at the same time. According to his statistics, the current gold reserve of various countries is estimated to be £2.272 billion according to the old fineness of 1928. Among them, the gold group countries account for 38%, the United States accounts for 33%, and the remaining countries account for 29%. If the fineness of the currencies of various countries is reduced by an average of 60%, then the world's gold reserve can be increased to £4.863 billion in an instant. The panic of world cash shortage can disappear. As for the implementation steps, he advocated the following: (1) Convene an international economic conference. (2) Increase prices by reducing fineness. (3) Stabilize exchange rates under the agreed equilibrium state of various countries. (4) Increase the contact between the central banks of various countries. (5) Strive to increase the gold reserves of the central banks of various countries. (6) Abolish the exchange controls, import and export restrictions, and other systems that hinder free trade. (7) The solution to the war debt indemnity problem.</p>
<p>The world today is still in the era of the selfish opposition of capitalist countries. The failure of the London Economic Conference can be taken as a lesson. Today's world economy is still living in a confusing and dull age under the confrontation between the gold group and the low group. However, according to the observations of several world-renowned economists, they all say that the road to restoring world prosperity is either for countries to compromise with each other to jointly reduce the fineness of gold coins and restore the gold standard; or for the gold group countries to be unable to endure it and be forced to abandon the gold standard, to raise the general prices in the world, and then restore the gold standard in succession. They all think that in the end, it will not be out of these two paths.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Suggestions for Cooperation Between Shanghai Fish Market and Fish Dealers <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Qin Sun</p>
<p>In order to revitalize the fishing industry, the Ministry of Industry established a large-scale fish market in Shanghai, with modern construction and equipment, which is quite perfect. In the future, fresh fish can be preserved and processed to seek a good price; there will be no more corruption that is difficult to last, and it is urgent to sell the goods, which damages the blood. However, the organization of the fish market is entirely state-owned, and merchants are not involved; therefore, it cannot gain the trust of the fish industry, forming a confrontational situation, and it is still difficult to open it. I think that if there is sincerity between the Ministry of Industry and the fish dealers, there is no need for meaningless disputes, but only to firmly adhere to the premise of mutual trust and common trust to seek cooperation. Otherwise, what both sides call benefiting the fishermen will make the fishermen even more confused.</p>
<p>The fish dealers have a tooth permit, which is a legally protected broker. Fishermen venture out to sea to catch fish, relying entirely on fish dealers to lend them capital, which is repaid by selling the catch. However, it is borrowed as it is repaid, eventually accumulating to a huge number. At present, this "fish loan" of Shanghai fish dealers is estimated to be a total of 2.5 million yuan, with an average of about 100,000 yuan per household. After the establishment of the fish market, the fish dealers may lose their original position, so how to handle this fish loan? I hope you will not let the fish dealers suffer the loss alone, which would hinder the progress of the fish market. How about using the original fish dealers as brokers for the fish market? The brokers should be fully responsible for sales, and all accounts of vendors should be handled by the brokers themselves; the fish dealers should transfer all the previous 2.5 million yuan of fish loan claims to the fish market for acceptance. The method of transferring claims can be that the fish market presents to the competent authority to issue a kind of fish industry reorganization and repayment bond. The fund for this bond is designated to be allocated from the fish market's monthly commission income. According to recent statistics, the annual trade volume of Shanghai fish products averages 20 million yuan. The commission is 8% of the value, according to the precedent, and the total annual income is 1.6 million yuan. The fish market and the brokers divide the 8% commission rate, and we assume the ratio is 5 to 3, then the net commission income of the fish market is 1 million yuan per year. If half of it, 500,000 yuan, is allocated to the bond fund, it can be paid off in installments within five years. Or it may be that what the fish dealers get is only a ledger changed to a face value, and the fish dealers are in the position of a broker, and because of the lack of circulating cash, a clever woman cannot cook without rice. Therefore, in addition to the above-mentioned fund for the bond, all of its property (estimated value of more than 1 million yuan) should be provided as a priority collateral, and the Ministry of Industry should be a joint guarantor, stating the bond. If so: the material and spiritual conditions of this bond are complete, and if someone holds it to discuss with the financial sector, the financial sector will surely be happy to cooperate, and all difficulties will be solved easily, and the development of the fishing industry can be predicted.</p>

<h3 id="e198">Securities Last Week, the Northern Faction Dumped the Most Debentures <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>From April 22nd to 27th last week, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was in a week of transition between the old and new futures contracts for April and June. At the beginning of the week, prices rose slightly due to a squeeze as the settlement date approached. Towards the weekend, prices fell back due to some rumors. The market generally lacked special fluctuations and remained in a state of consolidation. The bankruptcies of Yongxing and Tongtai money shops occurred when futures contracts were nearing settlement and causing a squeeze, without causing any significant impact. The price of American silver continued to rise without any sign of stopping, deeply affecting the domestic financial market. Interbank lending was barely sufficient to prevent a major collapse, leaving people uneasy and restless. Consequently, many transferred their deposits to foreign banks, and a significant number engaged in arbitrage. The fundamental reason for this is the undeniable financial problem. Future trends will depend on government support. A large amount of the 1996 public bonds are held on account, and any slight easing will lead to short covering. Therefore, even though they are practically worthless, there is still much arbitrage trading, preventing a sharp decline. Last week, the Northern Faction emerged due to the bankruptcies of the two money shops, selling at prices about one-tenth to one-half of a dollar lower. Monday was the last day for April futures, and there was a slight squeeze. Although the money market was tight, the official rate was raised to 43 cents, and market prices rebounded sharply, with short covering pushing prices up by one dollar. On Wednesday and Thursday, only May futures were traded for one month, the market was dull, prices were stagnant, and trading was extremely quiet. Trading in 1996 bonds was relatively active. Friday was a market holiday for the settlement of April futures. On Saturday, the price of American silver rose again, and as June futures started trading, transactions increased sharply, and market prices fell by half a dollar. Most of the selling came from the Northern Faction and major players, while retail investors were the primary buyers. Overall, market prices generally showed mixed gains and losses, averaging around half a dollar. The total turnover was 68,715,000 yuan. A comparative list of the price changes is shown below (unit: yuan, turnover in hundreds of yuan):</p>

<p>Yesterday, the cotton market opened with Liverpool news unfavorable, causing long positions to liquidate and prices to fall by 5 to 9 points for all months. Later, old cotton recovered due to purchases by spot traders, while new cotton lacked momentum due to the weakening silver market, ultimately failing to rise. The market closed steadily, with spot prices unchanged, old cotton down 1 point, and new cotton down 8 to 10 points. The English cotton market was stable, with spot prices up 2 points and futures up or down 1-2 points. Indian cotton initially rose due to purchases by Japanese traders but weakened later due to profit-taking and long position liquidations, with Flat Er down 3.5 to 3.75 rupees, Omra up half a rupee, and White Raw Creek down 0.75 to 1.75 rupees.

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the supply from various gangs was particularly scarce, with only deliveries from the 16th and 17th (totaling over 3,000 dan). The weather suddenly turned cold, stabilizing public sentiment. Sales in this area were moderate, and the sluggish situation gradually tightened. The price of Su Tong and other japonica rice increased by 10 cents for bulk goods, high-grade materials up 10 cents, and South Port early rice up 10 to 15 cents. However, the market for green-skinned Song, Si, West, and Lian late rice was weak, with only the Qingdao gang handling over 300 packages, adding only a few cents. The shadow of price changes remains to be seen, with no glory or shame.</p>

<p>The Insurance Yearbook is a creative work and a necessary book for the times. The development of the insurance industry is closely related to the development of industry and commerce, as well as the cultivation of general wealth. Chinese people are generally unfamiliar with the insurance business, which prevents them from using it for prevention and wealth accumulation. This book can fill this gap by providing detailed investigation and records of the business nature of the insurance industry and the current state of the insurance industry both in China and abroad, making it a valuable reference for general use.

<h3 id="e204">Linguists Dabbling in Literature <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Leng Mo</p>
<p>The study of linguistics generally includes how to write well. And good writing is commonly referred to as literature. Therefore, linguists naturally tend to also become writers. In an environment that worships experts, the position of a linguist may be better than that of a writer. For example, when Liu Bannong was referred to as a writer because he was a linguist, some people complained for him, regretting this. But the general trend is that movie stars are more popular than writers, and writers are more popular than specialized scholars. Is it possible that some linguists, for the sake of popularity, would rather be known as writers? This is worth considering. Although we cannot ask Mr. Bannong in the afterlife, I'm afraid there are others who can give a definite answer.</p>
<p>Liu Xunyu said that many people in Chinese academic fields dabble in literature, but unfortunately, when they do science, it's purely science, and when they do literature, it's purely literature. They have no intention of building a bridge to connect science and literature (paraphrased). Linguists dabbling in literature are the same. But linguistics itself is close to being a bridge between science and literature. Therefore, when linguists dabble in literature, it's purely literature, as if they are deliberately distinguishing between the two. It's difficult to understand why this is the case. Perhaps it is to avoid entering an ivory tower.</p>
<p>Specialized works are generally not very compatible with general reading materials. When treatises on linguistics were very common, *Yu Si* also published articles on the authenticity of the *Zuo Zhuan* and ancient phonology, and *Xin Yue* also published articles on the rigorous study of entering tones. These great works naturally made general readers feel bored. Therefore, after that, there were very few treatises on language published outside of specialized academic journals. Furthermore, the linguistic treatises in specialized publications became increasingly distant from the interests of the general public. In fact, there are many issues related to linguistics that are of great interest to the general public, and it is not impossible to reconcile them with general publications. Going to the smallest details to study specialized knowledge does not seem to be the only pursuit of specialized scholars. Linguists often say this is essential. But if we want to know the pronunciation of a word in a certain dialect, we still have to look for dialect dictionaries compiled by foreigners. There isn't even a Shanghainese dictionary compiled by locals. This seems to be the fault of linguists who are only engaged in lofty or irrelevant pursuits.</p>
<p>Recently, problems that are often touched upon, such as spoken language, handwritten characters, typos, phonetic typefaces, and literacy primers, are all closely related to linguistics. However, there seem to be very few linguists who discuss these problems. Seeing Wang Yile's "Conservatism of Characters" on the issue of typos in *The Independent Critic* made me feel very fortunate. Perhaps this small opinion from a linguistics professor is no less effective than his translations of many famous French literary works. The writer Zhou Zuoren said that he wondered whether it was better to have studied for a long period of time or to have studied in the navy for six years, so he was preparing to "abandon writing for martial arts." Although this is still humorous, it is truly believed that it is inevitable to be a square peg, but one cannot help but hope that linguists would abandon writing for language.</p>
<h3 id="e205">A Sequel to The Travels of Lao Can <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Han Feng</p>
<p>Although only six chapters of "A Sequel to The Travels of Lao Can" remain, its content constitutes a complete "Biography of Yi Yun." Mr. Liu Dajun believes that this nun of the Doumu Palace on Mount Tai, who had a great awakening, has lived in his heart for ten years. Mr. Lin Yutang also wrote a preface, believing that "if there really is such a person in the Doumu Palace, I must go to Mount Tai." In Liu Tieyun's writing, Yi Yun is truly worthy of being an extraordinary person who has seen through the cause and effect of the material world. However, when I finished reading this incomplete copy in one go, the impression I got was different from those of the two gentlemen, and my feelings were beyond the character of Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Looking back at the twenty chapters of the original "The Travels of Lao Can," Liu Tieyun liked to entrust his ideals to extraordinary people in the novel. And these extraordinary people must conform to his own ideals: pure, unconstrained, otherworldly, and having a great understanding of human society. Of course, such people cannot be found in the human world. In order to suit his romantic ideals, he had to use his talent to create them. Due to the suitability of various conditions in the ideals of the people of the old era, and the author's own psychological reasons, this created ideal character inevitably fell on a woman. Therefore, in the original book, he created a Yu Gu, and in the sequel, he could not help but create another Yi Yun.</p>
<p>Liu Tieyun was not only unconstrained but also very romantic. Therefore, at any time, he coexisted with the "true self" and the "ideal self." In the original travels, there was Lao Can, and then there was a Yu Gu; in the sequel, he wrote about Lao Can and then created Yi Yun. Lao Can represents a person with a stronger human nature, while Yu Gu and Yi Yun are his surreal ideals, a creation of an idealistic view of life and the world. Reading "The Travels of Lao Can" without focusing on this point makes it very difficult to gain a deep understanding of the author. Only by understanding this point can one understand why Liu Tieyun, who had a scientific mind, added these two fabricated characters to "The Travels of Lao Can," which was very realistic.</p>
<p>Although Yu Gu and Yi Yun are both embodiments of Liu Tieyun's ideals, Yi Yun is more developed in substance. The effort spent on writing Yi Yun was greater than that spent on writing Yu Gu, because this was his more ideal and more sublime shadow, the condensation of his later life view and the creation of the universe. In the talks of Yu Gu, the principles of mutual reference of the three religions are reflected. By his later years, when writing the sequel, he completely placed the focus on Buddhism.</p>
<p>Perhaps because it was ultimately an ideal and could not be cut off from the human world, there were still many complaints and dissatisfactions with the existing world. From Yi Yun's conversations, one can see how rampant the officials were at that time and understand how ugly the human world was. Without decisively separating from the human world, readers feel related to this character, and the success of this character's creation lies in this, and the author's success also lies in this. As for Yi Yun's self-description of the process of jumping out of the emotional bonds, this is completely the compassionate heart of Lao Can, who uses a rattle to transcend the human world, telling the reader how to transcend the ordinary and enter the sacred. This is why Lao Can sent Cui Huan into the temple without hesitation. In his later years, Liu Tieyun, after suffering various setbacks, although his passion remained, he inevitably had a sense of fatigue.</p>
<p>To understand Liu Tieyun's later thoughts, and for those who have read the original book, this sequel to "The Travels of Lao Can" is worth reading. But I don't agree with what Liu Dajun said, that the writing style is superior to the original book. Writing about Yi Yun's psychology is indeed a new realm in Liu Tieyun's creation, but many of the excellent parts of the original book, such as Daming Lake, Wang Xiaoyu, and the Yellow River water fetching scenes, are not inferior to the success of dissecting Yi Yun's psychology. Saying that there is new development in the description, I completely agree. Furthermore, the main reason for the success of the original book lies in the realism of social life and his relatively scientific method. Although there is the ideal Yu Gu, the focus is not on this aspect, and the impression that readers can get is a sense of reality. The sequel is the opposite, because it only wrote about Yi Yun, the realistic component is lighter. Although it feels pleasing when reading, it ultimately feels like reading an "ideal novel." The whole book is just a beginning, of course, it cannot be used to make a conclusion. However, there is no need to give the sequel a higher rating than the original book in any aspect.</p>
<h3 id="e206">On the Asahan River <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Fei Er</p>
<p>The Asahan River, once a disputed territory between the Chinese and Malays, is the seat of the governor who rules over us Orientals—Orientals, except for Japan, implying those who are ruled. For two years, I had repeatedly thought of going there, but I could never make it happen due to various reasons. This time, I finally made the trip.</p>
<p>In the morning, as the Singapore-Raja steamer turned from the open sea into the Asahan River, the river's current grandly welcomed us, and the achievements of the Chinese fishermen were displayed before our eyes.</p>
<p>At the mouth of the Asahan River, starting from the first row of fish-trapping structures erected by Chinese fishermen deep into the sea, the steamer passed through the fishermen's pillar-stakes for several hours. The Chinese, with their strong and hardworking bodies tanned by the scorching sun, raised sails and cast nets on the Asahan River. Looking out from the steamer, one could see fishermen everywhere on the river, carrying their catches and combating the tropical sun with healthy laughter. Because I had been in K City and had mingled with these fishermen, I knew a little about their way of life; so when I saw the joy they enjoyed after working and harvesting, laughter also welled up deeply in my own heart.</p>
<p>I silently blessed the people who catch fish and shrimp, saying, "The seas of the Pacific and Indian Oceans are yours, and so are the seas of the vast Nanyang Archipelago."</p>
<p>Watching the fishermen with their bare, dark bodies, using their strong arms to pull up the net ropes from the sea and river, or even diving deep into the water to fight fierce fish, yet calmly surfacing with a triumphant smile, I shared in their joy. Or when the tide rose, and waves constantly crashed against their small fishing boats, but our fishermen bravely continued their work, letting their small boats float and sink in the waves, a sense of admiration and envy welled up in my heart:</p>
<p>"What am I, compared to them? Look at the sons of the earth, these masters of the sea!" Thinking of their rugged life journey, I felt an unusual sense of shame.</p>
<p>Due to the current, the boat often sailed close to the shore, sometimes hugging the left bank and sometimes the right. As the boat moved at a sluggish pace, within a foot or so of the shore, the river water, buffeted by the ship, constantly splashed waves onto the beach, creating a splashing sound. Near the riverbank, coconut groves were constantly being eroded, and occasionally one or two coconut trees would fall sideways into the river, their treetops leaning precariously into the water. On the shore, monkeys were often seen playing in the wild vines, coconut groves, or attap thickets. As soon as the steamer approached, the passengers would make "hissing" sounds at them, and the young monkeys would hide in their mothers' arms.</p>
<p>On the white foam churned up by the river, various tree trunks and pieces of wood rushed along with the rapid current; boats sped by like arrows; or there were boatmen wearing Turkish-style hats, using hand-operated oars, and covered with attap leaf canopies, ready to carry passengers, but their postures were unusually lazy.</p>
<p>Along the riverbanks, houses covered with attap leaves were often found, sparsely half-hidden among the coconut groves. A ladder hung from the bank into the river; Malay women held their children and stood at the end of the ladder, staring at the steamer.</p>
<p>Once the boat reached Bagan, the port of Asahan, the travelers' hearts were filled with joy. Bagan is a port city where fishermen gather, displaying a splash of red amidst the greenery, with the messy corners of attap houses facing the travelers. As the boat approached, the streets along the shore were clearly visible. Fishermen walked along the streets in twos and threes, or stopped to gaze at the steamer.</p>
<p>As soon as the boat stopped in the river, Chinese coolies rowed wooden boats loaded with fishing products close to the ship. The stench of salted fish and shrimp pierced the nostrils of the passengers from the piles of cargo. The sound of machinery suddenly became noisy, and cranes loaded package after package of goods into the ship's hold. Afterward, the Dutch captain frowned on the top deck, while the fishermen sent the steamer off with bitter smiles.</p>
<p>"The price of fish has recently plummeted, so even the K.P.M. company has reduced shipping costs," Mr. Lin, who was traveling with me, told me as the boat departed.</p>
<p>I understood the scene of the captain's and the fishermen's expressions. In K City, my fisherman friends would have told me. If circumstances and a longer article allow, I will record these events!</p>
<p>After the boat set sail, the Dutch captain on the top deck picked up his hunting rifle and shot at fish in the river for fun. Hearing the sound of a gunshot, I glimpsed a fish in the river, wounded by the shot, raising its tail, its body flipping towards the center of the river, splashing the river water into a burst of waves, before sinking into the river and disappearing.</p>
<p>One shot after another rang out, and the river water continued with one burst of waves after another: and one fish after another, after sticking their heads out of the water to breathe, quietly sank into the water and disappeared without a trace. The fun and interest of this scene drew the attention of all the passengers on board, and the white people on the top deck erupted in bursts of laughter. But when I thought of the current plight of the Chinese fishermen, I felt a surge of disgust for the captain's entertainment after his frown, for some reason.</p>

<p>— Ai Wu</p>
<p>The man threw the cigarette he was about to put in his mouth into the mountain ditch blocked by trees by the roadside. He stood up, grabbed the wooden stick under his feet, and pointed to the hillside not far away, smiling and said:</p>
<p>"Look, that's the business I do!"</p>
<p>The three people who were frightened by his raising the stick quickly looked towards the hillside. Among the short green trees, there was a tide like white waves—that was just some moving sheep.</p>
<p>Old Chen finally breathed a sigh of relief, but he was still speaking quickly, probably because he was suddenly happy.</p>
<p>"Well, this, this is a good occupation!"</p>
<p>Boss Qin sighed comfortably, greatly relieved, and immediately slapped his feverish face, blaming himself for saying such pitiful and embarrassing words just now.</p>
<p>Old Xu was so happy that he scratched his head and praised repeatedly:</p>
<p>"The sheep are really fat, really fat!"</p>
<p>The shepherd walked up the hillside path, singing:</p>
<p>"The wind is too strong,</p>
<p>The rain is too heavy,</p>
<p>I'm not afraid of shepherding on the hills!"</p>
<p>Someone on the hillside followed up with:</p>
<p>"I'm not afraid of heaven,</p>
<p>I'm not afraid of earth,</p>
<p>What does the emperor count for!"</p>
<p>The shepherd grabbed and sang again:</p>
<p>"What does the emperor count for?</p>
<p>Sheep's feet are dry,</p>
<p>Pig's tail!" (The End)</p>

<p>— (By L.T. Farrell of the United States) Translated by Yi Xian</p>
<p>One contestant after another gave up, the scope of the competition narrowed, but a month passed, and the days dragged on. One day, someone's birthday was celebrated on the dance floor. Another day, two newly acquainted contestants got engaged right there on the floor. This led to various crude jokes, one after another, some even talking about their wedding night. Later, this engaged couple was impulsed by lust and could not restrain themselves for a moment: the girls couldn't help but scream, and the girl was dragged off the floor. They both lost their qualifications and withdrew from the "Marathon." New fresh anecdotes came out again. One day, a girl pulled out a bunch of decayed teeth right there on the floor, and soon after, she was dizzy and spinning and dancing again. One day, because of the unemployment of both husband and wife, an Italian teenager who was dancing with his wife trampled his leg and developed a high fever. Although his eyes were red and swollen from the heat, and painful wrinkles were printed on his haggard face, he still limped and danced. After twelve hours, because the illness worsened, the notary forced him to withdraw from the competition.</p>
<p>Again and again, Tax reached out and received some unexpected income, and he could have been satisfied and wanted to leave the field, but he always persevered stubbornly. Like the other contestants, he often fell asleep in a daze, so he had to be awakened by external methods to keep him dancing. The male nurse patted his face with a warm towel, put his shoes on the wrong feet, rubbed him with an electric vibrator, dug his throat with his fingers, and trimmed the corns on his feet. At one point, his cough became severe, turning into chest pain. At one point, he was in a state of delirium for a full three weeks. His dance partner Mary also endured the same misery. They were still dancing. Day after day, night after night passed, and the contestants on the floor were reduced to thirteen pairs, ten pairs, eight pairs, five pairs, and finally only two pairs were left. Then Mary fainted, she was sent to the hospital, and Tax lost his qualification. They each received the second-place prize, two hundred and fifty yuan.</p>
<p>The methods of sleeping and making money were produced day by day, and he tried his best to make use of them, so all the contestants had more money. Everyone practiced their knife tricks, magic tricks or skills, a song, a dance, some kind of special skill, until they attracted everyone's attention, and the crowd threw money at them. One contestant was a rude country boy, originally from Lithuania, with a nasal accent. He shouted that shaving samples was his special skill. Tax, for his part, learned a kind of dance. Stores, theaters and cable companies also offered them fees, asking them to wear some kind of mark, or to wear undershirts with advertisements printed on both the front and back. They received money, and also received letters from admirers, often written in poor language, not much different from how Tax usually wrote. Various kinds of long-lasting viewers each selected the dancers on the floor and shouted encouragement to them.</p>

<h3 id="e210">The Problem of Lecithin for Smoking Cessation (The Problem of Lipoid for Smoking Cessation) (3) <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Pang Jingzhou</p>
<p>Explaining to the public, introducing to medical colleagues</p>
<p>However, the Health Department's sale of lecithin this time has the following mistakes and resulting malpractices:</p>
<p>(A) It did not first introduce the drug sample and Mr. Ma's literature to the medical community in advance, so that doctors had some doubts and indifference about this new brand of lecithin, and did not make a definite judgment. Some doctors, because they did not know what it was, casually abandoned it.</p>
<p>(B) Since the products of the Health Department use fashionable brands, and the tone in the instructions is very commercial, not in a tone for doctors, but only in a tone for smokers, so some people suspect that the Health Department's sale of this drug is a money-making career, with the intention of monopolizing the national smoking cessation drug, which has led to the imitation and abuse by speculative pharmacists, which was something the inventor, Mr. Ma, did not anticipate.</p>
<p>(C) Item 4 of the instructions did advise those taking lecithin to "preferably be guided by a doctor, or it is advisable to be hospitalized," but the psychology of smokers is not to be hospitalized and not to be guided by a doctor, so they buy lecithin to eat. So the lecithin sold is only for blind eating, only for trying, and the results are not good.</p>
<p>(D) Item 3 of the instructions, "After quitting smokers take this medicine, they will naturally and automatically reduce the amount of smoking every day, and feel disgusted," is the most sensational and fits the taste of our people for simple prescriptions. You must know that in the ideal of general smokers, it is not that they do not want to quit smoking, but they are afraid of how much pain it will cause. Every day they hope for a simple prescription like a spiritual response to save their chronic illness. Now they see lecithin, thinking it is a panacea, but this kind of smoker lacking self-control can take it at home, and reduce their smoking amount by themselves, (the life and thinking of people at home and smoking criminals in hospitals are completely different, no need to elaborate), so from hoping too much to disappointment, from disappointment to indiscriminate criticism, saying that lecithin is worthless, this kind of public opinion is all over society, and then asking doctors to prove the theory, it is too late, Chinese things are often like this.</p>
<p>(E) The Health Department thought that the level of smokers was very high, and attached a record form when selling it, asking the takers to fill it out themselves, but as a result, very few people filled it out, even if they filled it out, it was not complete, and even if it was complete, it was not sent to the Health Department, so that they still could not get the majority of statistics, and even disliked the poor taste of the Health Department's products, which was cited as incomplete research and criticized. So speculative pharmacists said that delicious lecithin was about to be launched on the market. What kind of pharmacology are we talking about in this situation?</p>
<p>(F) The Health Department did not prepare adequately before selling this drug, and did not adopt a registration method, so that the products could not meet the demand, and most of them were consumed by people who tried it and ate it blindly, while the users who were truly determined were turned away. Item 6 in the instructions strongly urged users to "not interrupt taking this drug," but as a result, the Health Department seemed to have broken faith with users because of the lack of goods, and people who did not understand blamed the drug itself, which was a bit of a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>(6) Is lecithin the best product for quitting smoking?</p>
<p>This question is probably what you are eager to know. However, to answer this question, it is necessary to be able to determine the efficacy of lecithin before comparing it with other drugs. Although the author has used a lot of lecithin, he has not been able to exhaust other methods. Even if you check the records of various countries, you may not be able to draw a conclusion. Because in this answer, there is still a major premise to determine the meaning of the two words "quit smoking." ——The so-called broad meaning of smoke poison includes morphine bills, red pills, white noodles, soil leather, faucet water, and all addictive substances similar to opium. In a narrow sense, it can be said that it only refers to the gun smoking of yattachee, yuntoo, Persian soil, and Rehe soil. In the past, Chinese people mostly used gun smoking. Now that the national economy is collapsing day by day. As a result, there are more and more quick-acting drug relief methods. However, compared with foreign countries. Gun smoking is still more common with us. They have very little. Foreign drug bans are strict. Anyone who is addicted is a criminal. If found, they will be forced to quit. Addicts are all criminals. And criminals are mostly hospitalized patients. Hospitalized patients are mostly those who swallow and inject morphine. Naturally, the smoking cessation methods they research are biased towards hospitalization. Moreover, for the sake of time and economy. It is more biased towards quick quitting. But my country is different. In the past, when the ban on smoking was relaxed. The literati used it to treat diseases. Beautifully named it Fushou Ointment. Prepared during social gatherings to respect guests. Treating it like Shaoxing wine. There are even idlers. I entrusted my life to this. Even treating it as an antique to appreciate. "The bucket is ripe, the gun is spiritual, the lamp comes out of the cover. The smoke is fragrant, the tea is ripe, the pillow is high." Fourteen characters. It is enough to describe the fun of weeping and groaning in the smoky clouds. Therefore, this group of gun smokers. Spiritual preferences. Than physical habits. The changes that can be traced in cells. Still deeper (according to the effect of opium. On the spirit to produce Euphoril. Translated as a kind of light feeling. This is perhaps not related to Mr. Ma's Golgi apparatus.) Therefore, in addition to considering adopting many established methods in the world. It seems necessary to consider the needs of gun smokers, Mr. Ma Wen Zhao tried lecithin this time. I feel this thing. Or closer to the truth than other methods. He really had great aspirations. But he did not consider himself above all methods, especially the results he obtained in the hospital. For a few of the most comfortable smokers. Does not bear any mission. The author of this article is now in the industry. So I am closer to this kind of smoker. What I have seen and heard. Or different from Mr. Ma. Therefore, I summarize the experience of using lecithin as follows. (1) Lecithin does not have any major malpractices. Only those who cannot tolerate its taste have minor vomiting. Among the several people who had diarrhea after taking it. Half of them had dysentery. The diarrhea stopped after stopping the medicine. (2) All those who took lecithin gained weight. The amount of increase varies. (3) There is one person who abandoned the smoking gun and only replaced it with lecithin. There are no symptoms of addiction such as tears and nasal discharge. But the spirit is decadent. (4) When smokers automatically reduce smoking when taking lecithin. The first one or two weeks decreased very quickly. It becomes difficult after entering. Therefore, many people stopped halfway. It should be handled by a doctor immediately. (5) Those who take lecithin for a long time and then take opium substitutes. The tolerance is generally not reduced. (6) All those who have taken lecithin and have reduced to smoking two or three puffs a day. If there is no automatic determination (firm will.) And other dynamic determination (those who have a reason to be forced to quit). Still cannot quit addiction. In ordinary families. Only persuade smokers not to quit hard. Almost no one can represent the doctor to limit the amount of smoking for them. (7) According to Mr. Ma, although he gave patients gun smoking in the hospital. However, this kind of gun smoking is already under supervision. Not the most satisfactory thing for addicts. Then Mr. Ma's principle. It is "no need for opium after taking lecithin." Not "cannot be exposed to opium again after taking lecithin." So the word "and produce disgust" in the Health Department's instructions. A little too much. And many smokers. I feel that when it is reduced to two or three tubes. Not only do they not feel disgusted. And love is more constant. So they do not trust lecithin. (8) If you use substitutes to quit smoking. And take lecithin at the same time. Then the effect is easy and fast, this is Mr. Ma's initial test method.</p>
<p>Since the scope of poisonous substances is very wide. Moreover, the methods are not limited to gun smoking. The environment of the breathers is also different. So the method of correction. Do not be rigid. Scholars in the past have studied Gongxiang. The author once saw the book "The Opium Problem 1928 (The Committee on Drug Addictions in Collaboration with the Bureau of Social Hygiene)" published jointly by the American "Drug Addiction Research Committee and the Public Health Bureau" in 1928. It is rich in literature from various countries. The effects of opium on the spirit, cells and body are explored to the fullest. Mr. Ma's theory of the Golgi apparatus is only one end of this book. This book is accompanied by the treatment methods of various countries.</p>

<p>There are dozens of kinds. And Japan's Antimorchin and the recently popular plasma therapy are not included. Furthermore, to my knowledge, the Pernukton sleep method popular in Germany, the Surin smoking cessation method, and various prescriptions that do not require substitutes are numerous. (Note: Correcting the nervous system's addiction cannot be separated from the issue of time. Therefore, hypnosis is used to allow the smoker's period of suffering to pass in a state of sleep. Moreover, tonics are also frequently used. Thus, prescriptions using Strychnine are commonly seen. Even the commonly used Ci Bao Ming and other medications on the market are merely aids to the spirit and do not contain any narcotics. This is included here because many people misunderstand.) If we limit the amount of smoking for those who want to quit, then are the old Lin Zexu methods of China and methods like salt-fried rice flour with raw tobacco not effective? As for psychotherapy, how can we know that the immortal water from the Jigong altar is not helping a small number of people quit? However, practicing physicians on the market, in order to cater to the comfortable smokers, always cannot escape the trap of substitutes. Since three years ago, the plasma injection method (i.e., the currently called autologous blood serum injection method) used in France to quit drinking was promoted to Shanghai, and a certain general also used this method to quit smoking and went abroad. Therefore, it became a fad for a time. When egg yolk lecithin came on the market, it seemed like there was a three-legged race. Smoking cessation hospitals on the sea often claimed in their advertisements, "This hospital is superior in all three methods," etc. It really looks down on the scientific world too much. (Note: This article can be referenced in many books. Please do not use my words as advertising material.)</p>
<p>In conclusion, there are many methods to quit smoking. Some take the direct approach, some take the indirect approach, some emphasize the spirit, and some emphasize the body. Each has its own reasons and value. Patients have different levels of addiction, and the speed of effectiveness varies. This article is limited to a brief explanation and cannot describe them one by one. Let me give a few documents related to Mr. Ma's method below. (1) In 1922, the German F.A. Looks mentioned the chemical relationship between morphine and egg yolk lecithin. (2) In 1925, the German Ph. Klee and O. Grossman used Cholin, which is a substance containing egg yolk lecithin. (2) In 1926, Alexander Lambert and Frederick Tilney used a kind of prepared medicine called Narcosan to quit smoking. One-third of the things contained inside are the lipoid substances in soybeans and cottonseed. It's simply like the products of the current Department of Health. (4) Last year, the French magazine Bulletine de medicine 1934 B XT. published an article entitled Procedede Deintoxication rapide des morphinomanes par les lmulsiones de lipoides, which described the use of lipoid emulsions and other oils injected into the muscles, requiring five injections a day, five centimeters each time, to quickly quit morphine addiction in five to seven days. His theory is to use lipoid substances to remove the old addiction of the nervous system, which is quite similar to Loofs' theory. But this method of use is only suitable for hospitalized patients.</p>
<p>(7) Conclusion</p>
<p>Writing continuously, I have felt that it has taken a lot of words. To sum it up in a few words, let's come to an end.</p>
<p>(1) China, where toxic fog is permeating, really needs a fairy pill-like elixir to quit smoking, especially a comfortable prescription for smokers.</p>
<p>(2) Egg yolk lecithin is one of many smoking cessation methods. Compared with other methods, it seems very convenient and some people can limit their smoking without necessarily being hospitalized. It is best to use it as an adjunct to other methods, but it does not have the miraculous effect of a fairy pill.</p>
<p>(3) For the sake of the whole country, if more smoking cessation centers are established, many foreign successful methods can be adopted.</p>
<p>(4) Whether or not a drug is effective depends entirely on whether it is used properly. If it is not used properly, it cannot be attributed to the drug.</p>
<p>(5) Good medicine tastes bitter but is beneficial to the disease. Even if the medicine is good, the person taking it must endure a little. If the smoker is unwilling to give up the comfort of smoking at all, mothers will still smoke opium, because, strictly speaking, even the effects of opium and morphine are different.</p>
<p>(6) Increasing the determination of addicts across the country will increase the efficiency of smoking cessation methods. Only with strict laws.</p>
<p>(7) A part of the industry does not conduct much research on the emergence of this egg yolk lecithin, which seems too cold. It seems too early for the Department of Health to issue egg yolk lecithin to solicit statistics, not starting from various doctors and hospitals, but directly selling it to smokers. It is even earlier for pharmaceutical companies to rush to do speculative business before there are many statistics. And it is too bad to use only the words "egg yolk lecithin" to advertise smoking cessation specialists. (End)</p>

<p>(56) Rickets (Rachitis) (Continued)</p>
<p>(Question) What kind of symptoms appear in the joints after suffering from rickets?</p>
<p>(Answer) The joints have an abnormally strong range of motion.</p>
<p>(Question) Does rickets occur in older people?</p>
<p>(Answer) Children between the ages of ten and eighteen also develop the same symptoms as infantile rickets; this is specifically called late-onset or adolescent rickets.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the causes of late-onset rickets?</p>
<p>(Answer) It is probably a recurrence of early-onset rickets, so the causes are the same as those of early-onset rickets. But there are also cases where this disease occurs suddenly.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the symptoms of late-onset rickets?</p>
<p>(Answer) At the beginning of this disease, the patient complains of pain when standing or walking, complains of pain, is easily fatigued, and often develops convulsions.</p>
<p>(Question) What happens later?</p>
<p>(Answer) Later, spinal curvature, upper and lower limb curvature, and chest curvature appear. The skull also undergoes characteristic changes, such as a protruding upper chest, skull deformation, pale complexion, muscle relaxation, and delayed development. The limbs gradually shorten, becoming dwarfism.</p>
<p>(Question) How much time passes after the onset of rickets?</p>
<p>(Answer) After several months to several years, it is easy to recur.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the dangerous signs combined with severe rickets?</p>
<p>(Answer) It is often combined with spasmophilia, and sometimes it is easy to cause pyloric spasm, which is very dangerous.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the prognosis of adult rickets?</p>
<p>(Answer) If this disease can be treated properly, most cases can be cured. However, the deformation of the chest and the curvature of the limbs are permanent. In severe cases, development is inhibited, and many become dwarfs.</p>
<p>(Question) What diseases should be differentiated in diagnosis?</p>
<p>(Answer) It should be differentiated from congenital syphilis, Meller-Barlow's disease, and infantile myxedema.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the methods for treating rickets?</p>
<p>(Answer) There are three types of treatments: nutritional therapy, radiation therapy, and vitamin therapy.</p>
<p>(Question) What is nutritional therapy?</p>
<p>(Answer) In infants, breastfeeding should be given. After the child is six months old, add some vegetable juice, broth, fruit juice, etc. to the milk.</p>
<p>(Question) What is radiation therapy?</p>
<p>(Answer) Because the ultraviolet rays in sunlight have a special effect on rickets, patients should be irradiated with artificial sunlight lamps every day, and the cure is very rapid. In addition, the food that patients eat, such as milk and eggs, should also be irradiated with artificial sunlight lamps before eating.</p>
<p>(Question) What is vitamin therapy?</p>
<p>(Answer) It is a method of using supplemental Vitamin D. Cod liver oil contains a lot of Vitamin D and can be taken regularly. In addition, there are pure preparations such as Vanigtol Calciferrol Vitamin-D, etc., which are very effective when taken together with calcium agents. End</p>

<p>(45) Nasal Obstruction</p>
<p>Nasal obstruction is a major symptom in nasal diseases. Everyone can encounter this symptom because there are too many opportunities for nasal obstruction to occur. All kinds of rhinitis, nasal cavity tumors, nasal septum deformities, and nasal cavity foreign bodies that can cause swelling and thickening of the nasal mucosa can cause nasal obstruction. When we engage in respiratory movements, we mainly rely on the nasal cavity. If there is nasal obstruction, then the nasal cavity is obstructed and not open. The amount of breathing is also insufficient. It is bound to open the mouth to make up for breathing. This is called oral breathing. In cases of severe nasal obstruction, nasal breathing can be completely abandoned. At the same time, the surrounding organs and physical development of the patient are greatly affected by this. The conditions caused by the influence are briefly described as follows.</p>
<p>1. The conditions that occur in the surrounding organs that are most easily affected and develop lesions are the respiratory system and the auditory system. In terms of the respiratory system, pharyngitis, laryngitis, and tracheitis often occur. This is because the air inhaled through oral breathing is mostly dry. It is not like the air inhaled through nasal breathing, which can be moistened by the nasal mucosa, turning it into moist air, so that inflammation of the respiratory organs does not occur. In terms of the auditory system, oral breathing often leads to insufficient ventilation of the Eustachian tube, or even complete blockage. At this time, middle ear diseases are most likely to occur, and deafness often follows. In addition, it should be noted that patients with nasal obstruction often have narrow noises when engaging in nasal breathing. During sleep, snoring often occurs. Sometimes it often causes headaches, nasal attention deficit disorder, memory loss, sleep deprivation and other neurological symptoms.</p>
<p>2. The conditions that occur on physical development In the teenage years, it is the period of development of various parts of the body. If nasal obstruction is suffered during this period, it is easy to cause various developmental obstacles. One of the most prominent types of nasal obstruction that easily causes physical development disorders during adolescence is nasal obstruction caused by adenoid hypertrophy. The reasons for the development of adenoid hypertrophy and the cause of nasal obstruction will be discussed in my next continuation.</p>

<p>Angina Pectoris</p>
<p>Angina pectoris is a severe pain that occurs in the heart and radiates to the left shoulder and left arm. At the same time, the condition is critical and has the potential to cause death. The cause of this problem is generally arteriosclerosis of the heart vessels, myocardial degeneration, or problems with the root of the aorta. Syphilis, gout, chronic nephritis, excessive smoking, etc. Angina pectoris attacks are often caused by the use of muscle strength, such as climbing, walking against the wind, or stimulation of the heart and brain, or indigestion in the gastrointestinal tract.</p>
<p>Angina pectoris often strikes suddenly like a bolt from the blue. The heart pain is like a knife stabbing, and at the same time, it radiates to the left shoulder, left arm, and left hand. Each pain attack lasts for several seconds, several minutes, or several hours. Sometimes it occurs repeatedly within a few days, and sometimes it occurs once every few weeks or months. After the pain, the patient feels exhausted for several hours or days. The longer the angina pectoris attack lasts, the more mental loss there is.</p>
<p>When a person has this disease, his life and death are uncertain. Sometimes death occurs during the first attack, sometimes death occurs during the second or third attack, or death occurs at an unknown attack. Some people live for several years despite repeated attacks. In short, the more frequent the pain attacks and the longer they last, the easier it is to die.</p>
<p>The method of relieving angina pectoris can be divided into two types: symptomatic treatment and fundamental treatment. The purpose of symptomatic treatment is to relieve pain temporarily without asking what the cause is. For mild and short-term pain, inhaling amyl nitrite can stop the pain. If it cannot be stopped, injection of painkillers or inhalation of chloroform must be guided by a doctor. The fundamental treatment methods are: (1) Prevention. When the patient is not in pain, pay attention to a quiet life. Do not use physical strength, and do not be stimulated mentally. Be sure to abstain from smoking and drinking. Do not drink strong tea, because the caffeine in tea is stimulating. (2) Treatment. If the patient has had syphilis many years ago, be sure to treat the syphilis seriously. There is still hope for a full recovery from angina pectoris caused by old syphilis if treated properly. There is little certainty of a full recovery from any other type of angina pectoris treatment. In addition to temporary emergency relief, ordinary methods for treating heart disease can also be followed.</p>
<p>Rheumatism</p>
<p>Rheumatism is a disease in which the patient initially develops fever and pain in several joints at the same time, or the heart also becomes inflamed. The cause of the disease is mostly due to chronic inflammation of the tonsils, pyorrhea alveolaris, purulent rhinitis, etc. This kind of joint pain is when the affected joints are inflamed and painful together. It is most commonly found in large joints, such as the knee joint, ankle joint, shoulder joints, elbow joint, etc. The same problem can also occur in any other joint on the body. It is also common for this joint to just get better and other joints to start hurting again. Even a single joint sometimes gets better and sometimes hurts. The joint pain is unbearable day and night, and it is worse at night. The pain is lighter when the patient is lying still, and moving even slightly causes unbearable pain. The above is a summary of the pathology and symptoms of rheumatism. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Chapter 11 Complications of Pulmonary Tuberculosis by Mori Nagata Kenji</p>
<p>In general, every disease, in its entire course, will affect other organs due to the spread of symptoms: as a result, the organs there will also develop diseases. This kind of disease is medically called: "complications" or "after-effects." Its occurrence is possible in almost every disease; it is especially common in acute infectious diseases. For example, typhoid fever causes intestinal bleeding and intestinal perforation, as well as perforating peritonitis; scarlet fever causes nephritis and otitis media; measles causes tracheobronchial pneumonia; dysentery causes liver abscesses, etc. When a disease develops complications, its situation is mostly more serious and easily falls into incurability: even when the original disease is in a state of decline or remission, the occurrence of complications causes the patient to return to an extremely serious state. Therefore, in addition to treating the original disease, the physician's diagnosis also involves preventing complications, which is a very important task. Pulmonary tuberculosis is a very complex disease, and its symptoms are almost all-encompassing. Naturally, it cannot be an exception. As for the importance of the relationship between the presence or absence of its complications and the future of the disease, that goes without saying.</p>
<p>Regarding the complications of pulmonary tuberculosis, according to the different organs it affects, it can be divided into the following categories; namely! (1) tuberculous meningitis; (2) pleurisy; (3) pneumothorax; (4) digestive organs; (5) respiratory organs; (6) renal tuberculosis; (7) other complications; (8) the combination of pulmonary tuberculosis and other diseases. Each of these categories has its own special circumstances; now let us describe them one by one below: (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e216">Trial of the Beijing Romance Murder Case Begins <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Chen</p>
<p>Liu Jinggui of Beiping shot his rival in love, the lover of the popular athlete Lu Ming, and then surrendered himself to the authorities. This has already been a sensational event known to everyone, young and old, and there is no need to repeat it. Here, we want to talk about the trial of this romance murder case.</p>
<p>According to reports, when the trial began, the court deployed a large number of police and soldiers, armed and on guard, like the serious interrogation of Taibao A Shu back then; and the crowd of spectators in front of the court was the largest since the Tao Sijin love murder case. What we pay the most attention to is the situation of the news reporters regarding Liu Jinggui and Lu Ming, who were both defendants, when they were "prisoners." It is said that Liu Jinggui "had a smiling face," while Lu Ming "was sad and drooped his head," which shows that one was seeking benevolence and getting benevolence, regarding death as homecoming, while the other was blaming himself and being extremely embarrassed. Later, Liu confessed that she had physical relations with Lu Ming in Tianshou Apartments in Beiping, Beijing Hotel, Zhangyuan, etc., saying that Lu said, "Everything I have belongs to you, and everything you have belongs to me, what's wrong with sleeping together," which is no different from reading the beautiful articles of the Peony Pavilion. When she confessed that Lu had proposed to dissolve the engagement, she shed tears like rain, which is no different from reading Yuan Ji's Yingying poetry, with a dark and vivid expression.</p>
<p>We have read many of these realistic articles in recent years. For the average poet of self-sacrifice, he or she can probably chant some touching and tear-jerking poems, but we are really "numbed and injured," and can only calmly send a sad elegy. Yes, we admit that in recent years, many young men and women have suffered wounds from the "arrow of the god of love" and died. There are objective reasons for this, but many young men and women forget to avoid reality and hide in the small world of "love," becoming entangled and making it the only true meaning of life. It must be said that this is self-inflicted suffering and making a cocoon to trap oneself.</p>
<p>With the doctrine of love above all else, there have naturally been countless suicides for love and love murders in recent years. This phenomenon, discovered in times of peace, already shows a kind of unhealthy social consciousness, but it is prevalent in modern China, which is so-called "national crisis" and "national crisis," and it is inevitably very uncoordinated. In the present, is the "love" between men and women really like the popular "love classics" say, love is life, love is life, love is the God who dominates everything? It really only makes people sigh!</p>
<p>Liu Jinggui surrendered herself without fear of guilt after killing her rival in love, which shows her courage to "enter the gate of determination." She also showed her "generous righteousness" in "dying for love" by having a "smiling face" when she was interrogated. When she confessed that Lu Ming was ungrateful and terminated the contract, she "shed tears like rain," which can also show her "deep love and deep hatred" for Lu Ming. This kind of "love" spirit can certainly cater to the tastes of the average young master and young lady, scolding Lu Ming several times as "ungrateful." However, if this trend continues, the crime is not that they have nothing to say to society, but that it affects people's escape from reality and a kind of paralysis of "dying for love."</p>

<p>— Erlang</p>
<p>The people of Pengjia Village, nestled in the valley, knew little of the outside world. For two or three hundred years, only one scholar, Peng Guozhu, had emerged from the surrounding villages, which was considered remarkable at the time. Now, they heard that although the Republic no longer had scholars, university students were dozens of times more important than scholars. The son of the scholar was a university student in the capital, which was an incredible honor and glory. When the scholar's son, Peng Yaoxian, was admitted to a university in the capital, the entire Pengjia Village went wild. They set off firecrackers for an entire day, and the ancestral hall was opened wide. The scholar, leading all the elders and children of the clan, paid their respects and sacrifices to the ancestral tablets. Afterwards, they accepted congratulatory gifts of eggs from the neighbors and celebrated all day long. This time, the university student was returning home for a visit. It was said to be a summer vacation, just like a top scholar returning home in an opera. Several days before, the scholar had announced this news, and everyone had been discussing it animatedly, overjoyed and eagerly awaiting the spectacle. Early this morning, some people went up to the hilltop to watch the main road, but it was truly exasperating. After noon, there was still no sign of anything on the road. Everyone believed that a university student's return home for a visit would be a grand affair, with drums beating and escorts shouting, and his official sedan chair would be visible and audible from afar. However, there was no official sedan chair and no sound of drums on the road. Gradually, people became tired, and some went back to the fields.</p>
<p>At dusk, someone rushed down the hillside to the entrance of the village very quickly, it was A'da, Peng's family's long-term worker. A'da running down the hill meant the university student had returned, so everyone rushed to the ancestral hall to congratulate the scholar. Some even brought congratulatory gifts of eggs with them. Before long, they really heard the sound of drums on the hilltop, and then they saw an official sedan chair made of blue wool from afar, with a large white banner in front, followed by a team of armed soldiers after the white banner. "He's here! He's here! "The university student is even more impressive than a top scholar, with soldiers shouting ahead of the sedan chair!" The people of Pengjia Village laughed and shouted.</p>
<p>It turned out that this was all the scholar's idea. Yesterday, he had sent someone to the city to wait for his son and instructed him to ask the county magistrate to send a team to protect him, saying that bandits were rampant on the road. He also told him to make a large banner with the eight characters "Peking University Student Peng Yaoxian" written on it, and the drum players were hired from the city. - How impressive was the university student's return home for a visit? As soon as he entered the village entrance, firecrackers were set off, and the sound of drums echoed all the way to the ancestral hall. The official sedan chair stopped at the entrance of the ancestral hall. The university student was wearing a straw hat, a Western suit, and leather shoes, which was even more remarkable. However, when paying respects and sacrifices to the ancestral tablets, everyone knelt down, but the university student stood and bowed. It was outrageous! Not kneeling down to worship the ancestors, what kind of decorum was that? The scholar was so angry that his face turned red, and the clansmen were discussing it in secret.</p>
<p>However, afterwards, the scholar told people: "Now is the Republican era, kneeling is no longer in vogue. When university students meet the President in the capital, they simply bow." This restored the university student's respect in the eyes of the clansmen.</p>
<h3 id="e218">A Floating World Scene in May <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Xizhen</p>
<p>(The sun quietly shines on the faded cherry blossoms lingering on the surface of the stream. Plums are already showing their faces on the branches, green and vibrant. The season bravely and unreservedly strides forward. When the azaleas stand at the end of spring and call out a lamenting cry or two, the times have long lost the leisure of a poet's sigh and lament. Instead, like a valiant warrior, they rush headlong into a hotter, more exciting season without hesitation. The fully grown leaves on the branches are as plump and green as if they have been oiled. The flowers, following the will of nature, donate their beauty in anticipation of the fruits that are not far off. The stagnant water in the small river also resolutely abandons daydreams and doubts, flowing with a natural sense of survival. Here, all the elements of nature: the mountains, the water, the trees, the wild grasses, and the fruits and flowers, just like the will of all human beings in the world, are starting to play the symphony of nature's diligent and arduous construction with a vivid posture. What is blowing here is the wind of May - May, a season that is younger, more upward, and more full of growth than spring.)</p>
<p>No matter how heavy the shadow of hunger and suffering casts over the human world, sighing and madness are absent here, in the natural world, which serves as a barometer of the seasons. There is only an irreversible, unshakable rhythm following nature's will (just as mankind follows the laws of history): They act, they endure, they spend this boiling, scorching summer with a posture of survival, and they walk into a more stable harvest season through labor.</p>
<p>And now: The warm and peaceful climate has followed spring and gone, gradually, finally becoming a black shadow in history. The sweltering summer is not suitable for shallow lingering thoughts, it is full of a terrifying, unstoppable force of growth.</p>
<p>The tune of late April gradually breaks free from comfort. The busy streets are covered with a stubborn, fiery sun that scorches people's hearts. In the midst of this, people ignore the colorful banners of summer sales in the stores, ignore the thin clothes of leisurely women, and just hurry along the sides of the street: Each person carries a restless heart, a grimy body, walking like a tired ox.</p>
<p>Merchants are anxiously beginning to make semi-prayerful hopes: The end of April in this depressed year is a worrisome juncture: But maybe there is always a way to get through it, right? Yes, there must be a way to get through it, if only May would arrive -</p>
<p>(When May arrives, there will be the sounds of selling plums on the streets and in the alleys; there will also be many different moods on the streets and in the alleys. Big, black patrol cars, as stubborn as shadows, often appear on the road.)</p>
<p>The wind gradually picks up, May is a season that is more suitable for leisure. People (a portion of them) leave the tension and chaos of the metropolis, and like poets, go to the countryside with leisurely hearts, changing into light, thin outing clothes, bringing cars, canes, lovely wives, binoculars, cameras...</p>
<p>Thus, to the metropolis, to the streets and alleys lying within it: "May is not suitable for the metropolis; may this be a pleasant short trip, and may this May be peaceful!"</p>
<p>If April is prose, then May will definitely be romance.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Mountain Road <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Jia</p>
<p>Our hike this time is adventurous. Among the three companions, two have never walked this rugged mountain road before. In my memory, this is also an unfamiliar road, but I had walked it two years ago. We probably won't encounter any villages within twenty miles, but tonight we have to rush to a certain village about thirty miles from here.</p>
<p>On both sides are very high and steep cliffs, bare and without any trees or larger plants. I believe that even woodcutters wouldn't come to these places. However, in this mountainous area, such small paths are already considered the only transportation routes. We originally didn't want to come to this place. However, for the sake of that small school's employment contract and the alluring "profession," we three young people forgot about the hardship, because we felt the threat of unemployment and the terror of life. So we had no choice but to walk this unfamiliar and rugged mountain road to honor a friend's invitation and the warmth of a profession.</p>
<p>This area was originally not very accessible, and there are no waterways, so whenever something happens, you have to run. As usual, from the province, take the wheel-tow ferry unique to these two Guangxi provinces to where the water runs out, then go ashore. Once ashore, there are some highway buses waiting for passengers. After taking the bus to the county seat, running is already very close, only about seven or eight miles. However, recently, because of several days of heavy rain, the unstable highway has become muddy and impassable for cars, so everyone has to run. The local people are used to running, but it's no joke for us outsiders to come here and run this long thirty-odd miles.</p>
<p>It's okay to run at the beginning, there are villages, paddy fields, trees, and thatched huts. But when it comes to the end, there's only a mountain road flanked by cliffs on both sides. Moreover, according to the villagers, this mountain road will extend to twenty miles, and it's very close when you see fields of tobacco plants. We have to finish this mountain road, which is longer than thirty miles, this afternoon.</p>
<p>In the silent and terrifying mountain road, we can only rely on each other's courage and the burning heart fire of young people to light the way, and everyone is fearless and marching forward, like a team of soldiers attacking their enemies.</p>
<p>Sometimes we would complain, shouldn't have come to this mountainous area to find terror and trouble. However, a moment of courage encouraged us. We are still young, this little bit of hardship is not much, because we are going to "find food!" So we walked our unfamiliar mountain road with even bigger strides.</p>
<p>A burst of tobacco smell rushed into our nostrils. We felt an extraordinary pleasure. The mountain road has ended again, the green tobacco fields are rippling in front of us, and we are more happily accelerating this terrible journey to find the warmth of a profession.</p>

<h3 id="e220">Along the Longyou River <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Yuan Zhi</p>
<p>The night is like a thin silk veil, already enveloping the winding Longyou River.</p>
<p>Longyou River, what an elegant and uniquely stylish name. Just like its name, this river is elegant, with scattered shrubs and a green expanse of creeping grass and colorful wildflowers lining its banks. The river flows from the far west, winding and turning, like a long giant dragon. Any boats passing through this river, even if it's just a small bamboo leaf boat, cannot sail any faster. If you're impatient, it's no use. You have to slowly steer the oars left and right, crossing the surface of the river, before you can dispose of it according to your own intentions.</p>
<p>The water in the river is very clear, because the river's mouth connects to the lake, such a flowing stream, naturally not afraid of being polluted or the boat's oars stirring up the yellow mud at the bottom of the river, making the water turbid.</p>
<p>Relying on this river, thousands of acres of paddy fields and mulberry fields have bumper harvests every year, which is also where hundreds of households survive. They are all the children of the Longyou River, they are grateful and cherish it.</p>
<p>Besides the hundreds of households, the Longyou River also has an adopted son - the only fishing family that survives by it.</p>
<p>This fishing family is downstream of the Longyou River. A low, simple thatched shed is where they live and rest. An old fisherman, an old woman who is almost the same, and a young son live in the house.</p>
<p>The three people have lived here for a long time. The old couple remember very clearly, they rowed a small boat out of their hometown and lived by fishing here, gradually being able to build this shed with a few loads of mud and a few loads of thatch; later, how they bought a big dragnet and raised such a son. The old couple are even clearer that they are where they are now entirely because of the Longyou River's gift. The river is their hometown, the river is their factory.</p>
<p>In the twilight, it was no longer possible to distinguish everything clearly. The old fisherman standing next to the winch of the big dragnet raised his voice and shouted:</p>
<p>"Little Gouzi's mother, why haven't you lit the mast light yet?"</p>
<p>Little Gouzi's mother was cooking dinner by the stove. The stove without a chimney sent all the smoke around Little Gouzi's mother, making it impossible for her old eyes to open properly. Hearing the old man's shout outside, just as she was about to stand up, the old fisherman shouted again:</p>
<p>"Are you deaf? Such an irresponsible old woman... Hurry up, there's a big black carp in the net!"</p>
<p>While shouting, he worked the "handle" on the winch of the big dragnet even harder. He felt the net getting heavier and heavier; he thought, there must be a big black carp in the net; it probably swam upstream from the lake. This fish must weigh twenty or thirty pounds, haha, it would sell for several big silver dollars. Thinking about it, he couldn't help but become happier, a layer of smile spreading across his face.</p>
<p>The old woman brought the mast light. A tiny spark of light couldn't shine more than ten feet away. She hung it on a bamboo hook in front of the thatched shed, then walked close to the winch to help the old fisherman wind it. The two of them used all their remaining strength, their hearts full of extreme joy.</p>
<p>It just so happened that the son who had gone to the street to buy wine also came back, so he also came to help, winding and winding, hanging a large net high above the river. The son hurriedly went to fish with the "fish net," but no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't catch anything, so he couldn't help but become suspicious. When the old fisherman went to check with the mast light, a swollen child's corpse was lying stiffly in the net, and he couldn't help but shout "Ah -- yo".</p>

<p>— Chen Li'ang</p>
<p>This afternoon, I walked out of the house with a cigarette, so relaxed, without a single worry lingering in my mood. Before lunch, I had planned to do quite a few things. The letter from home had been put aside for five days and should be replied to. I couldn't find a single pair of intact socks in my suitcase, so I should buy some. The inkstone had a thick layer of ink, so I should wash it... But, when I took the first puff of my cigarette, I thought those things could wait. Sometimes I myself would wonder, "Why am I so lazy?" For many days, I had been living with this laziness.</p>
<p>My nature is to love leisure, but my environment has no leisure. I stubbornly want to extract leisure from busyness, abandoning what I should be doing and intentionally idling, without feeling uneasy or caring about other people's opinions. I believe that only in leisure can I truly appreciate the true interest of life. Although this is not true leisure, I am still very satisfied. How many people in this worldly world are not hurrying and worrying about their own lives? How many people can obtain a truly leisurely life?</p>
<p>This is indeed a habit I have developed. I will get rid of all trivial matters, but I also hurry for the sake of life. Sometimes sweat beads seep from my forehead, blisters appear on the soles of my feet, my arms move until they are sore, and my mind is entangled and dizzy by the shapes and colors of the outside world. However, my state of mind is often leisurely. In the public car, I will smoke and read the newspaper's supplement, so much so that sometimes I even forget the date. My friends say I am too muddleheaded, and I do not deny it. Perhaps in this era, in this world, only the muddleheaded can feel some joy.</p>
<p>So I sat with a cigarette under the wisteria trellis in the courtyard. The rain had stimulated the flowers to bloom, and the rain had also knocked the flowers off. Petals scattered on the courtyard ground made of soil, like a piece of bluish-gray cloth woven with purple floral dots, possessing a quiet and beautiful feeling. Therefore, the attraction of this beauty also crushed my soul, shattered it, and scattered it with the petals on the wet and slippery brick ground.</p>
<p>The courtyard is dilapidated everywhere, even the wisteria trellis is very decayed and on the verge of collapsing. The columns near the ground are wearing green moss leggings. The leaves and flowers are sparser year by year. I don't know if it's because it's old and withered, or if it's adapting to the environment of the decaying trellis. However, I also love this unhealthy, morbid appearance. I am still fortunate that the family of my courtyard owner has declined, otherwise, this old-fashioned tile house, the mossy wooden frame, the graceful wisteria, the green jade-like leaves, and the purple, cold, and beautiful flower petals would have long been replaced by cement, iron bones, red lacquer, stone blocks, and the ugly materials of modern civilization.</p>
<p>People's loves and hates are different. Many people may frown and say that my residence is filled with decadence and death, they love the ogre-like Western buildings, the pruned holly, the goldfish in the white stone pond, the iron railings, and the large flowers with stimulating colors. But these things, in our eyes, are ugly and vulgar. I am not used to contacting that rich and noble atmosphere, and I can't bear to see those people who are competing in the arena of fame and fortune without knowing when to rest. Perhaps they are also accusing me of being eccentric and narrow-minded at the same time!</p>
<p>However, I still feel at ease. Every day, I will still steal some leisure to sit under the wisteria trellis, smoking, and reading a little of my favorite books. At this time, I will forget what I should be doing, and what I should be recalling about the past. Under the wisteria trellis, you can't find any hurried emotions, any thoughts of fame and fortune, or any rich and noble atmosphere.</p>

<p>Supplement to the Shanghai Shen Bao Local Edition Movie Special Issue</p>
<h3 id="e225">The Making of the Newsreel of the Hauptmann Kidnapping Trial (Part Two) <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Ni</p>
<p>From the above conversation with Clifford, we can see that filming sound movies in the courtroom was not illegal, but was done with the express permission of the judge. However, the cameraman also had his tricks, which we can describe.</p>
<p>According to the American film industry's authoritative journal, "Film Daily," Judge Trenchard had instructed beforehand that the filming of newsreels in the courtroom was limited to times when the defendant was not being interrogated in the dock. That is, only the prisoner's idle movements and conversations could be filmed, not his state while being tried in the dock.</p>
<p>However, the company's cameramen deliberately violated this order. To be cautious and prevent news reporters from secretly filming, the court specifically ordered the bailiffs to turn off all the special lights installed for photography inside the courtroom when the prisoner entered the dock, and to lower the curtains halfway, dimming the courtroom and preventing secret filming. However, modern photography techniques deceived the judge, because the cameraman used extremely fast lenses and specially made extremely fast film to capture all the courtroom scenes while the prisoner was on trial.</p>
<p>Of course, when filming such a movie, there could be no sound of the camera's mechanism moving. This also required a special silent device to be installed on the camera beforehand. Furthermore, no one could stand next to the camera, but rather be hidden dozens of feet away, cutting the wires and using the intermittent current to control the camera's movements. Of course, these skills cannot be successfully executed by someone who is not experienced in this field.</p>
<p>However, we must also raise the second question: should such films of criminals be made, and do they have intrinsic value? On this point, New York District Attorney Dodge and criminologist Dodge made the following statement:</p>
<p>"Generally speaking, I am against and advocate banning all films, whether short newsreels or feature dramas, that depict the actions of criminals and suspected criminals. I believe that such films will have a bad influence after coming into contact with children. Even adults, if their minds and thoughts are not mature, may be led astray by the misunderstanding of heroism and glory inherent in the acts of crime and violations of criminal law seen in criminal films.</p>
<p>"As for the film of the Hauptmann trial, I don't think it's as bad. The way the prisoner cowered and felt ashamed under District Attorney Wilentz's burning gaze and sharp tongue is enough to show that a person who commits a crime can never escape the law. Not only is breaking the law not a broad road, but even after being arrested, one cannot simply die to end it all.</p>
<p>"That kind of mental suffering shows that anyone with awareness can know that after committing a crime, a person's bravery and composure to die are useless, and they have no choice but to tremble with fear, wanting to die but unable to. But to most people, it's just giving a German carpenter unparalleled publicity."</p>
<p>"In any case, I believe that such films should not be shown publicly until the criminal has been convicted."</p>
<p>The above is the opinion of a New York prosecutor, and also the majority opinion of American prosecutors. Now we will listen to the opinion of a famous lawyer and criminal defense attorney, Samuel Leibowitz.</p>
<p>Leibowitz's opinion is: "Not only have I not seen that newsreel, but I don't want to see it either. I think that kind of film should not be watched by anyone. I am extremely opposed to such sensational publicity about a criminal or a crime. I believe this is a common problem with American news policy. But since we have allowed many news reporters and novelists to sit in the courtroom and use their subjective pens to describe the prisoner's trembling in the witness stand, why should we make things difficult for the news photographers and not allow them to go a step further and give the prisoner an even more vivid portrait with sound and color? Of course, the film is clear and undeniable, but the news reporters' writing is somewhat unreliable. One says the prisoner was trembling with shame, while another says the prisoner was calm and unafraid of death. Who knows who is right?</p>
<p>"If our trial system adopted the dignified attitude of England, instead of the current circus-like situation with three classes of spectators, the filming of newsreels would certainly not be a problem.</p>
<p>In short, I don't want to see this film. It's not because I don't need to see the courtroom situation again, but because I fundamentally disapprove of everyone watching it, because spending money to watch it is encouraging the production of such films, and indirectly encouraging treating the courtroom as a joke and the trial as a circus.</p>
<p>"As for the cameraman violating the court order and secretly filming, it is especially despicable and hateful and should be severely punished." (End)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e226">Review of "Fallen Blossoms" <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Ren</p>
<p>——Xin Guang Films</p>
<p>Since "The Big Wind," director Wu Cun has appeared on the Chinese film scene with a new attitude. People have high expectations for him, believing that he will give us a lot of fresh artistic food.</p>
<p>Yes, this young director has the passion and courage to face reality squarely. He has a resentful mood and expresses his denial of the current society. He has a righteous passion and shows his jealousy towards ugliness. However, he is also an overly clever artist. He understands the wisdom of dealing with the world too well, so he is unwilling to make a frontal attack on the evils of the world, but only tries to touch the ugliness from the side with delicate brushstrokes, trying to insert some pungent irony into people's laughter. However, due to the rawness of his expression techniques, he cannot grasp the object he wants to express. He does not not criticize reality, but does not know how to criticize it. Even if it is ironic exposure, he cannot sharply touch the inner secrets of noble people. Therefore, his irony is only superficial and symbolic, like the big wind blowing off the gentleman's top hat or the lady's underwear in "The Big Wind". Similarly, in the contrast between positive and negative sides, he does not have the confidence to sympathize with the people he wants to sympathize with.</p>
<p>More importantly, his works show a very strong intellectual flavor. His vision is very broad, and his desire for self-satisfaction is also very strong. He wants to express everything he can feel in one work. He is unwilling and unable to filter his emotions and focus on a certain main purpose. Therefore, his passionate and uninhibited outpouring seems disorganized and chaotic in his works, as if he has not organized his materials.</p>
<p>However, his passionate expression only surges in "The Big Wind." In "Fallen Blossoms," he seems to have suffered some major blow, expressing his pessimism in a sad atmosphere. Now let's take a closer look at "Fallen Blossoms."</p>
<p>"Fallen Blossoms," like "The Big Wind," expresses a good intention. It depicts the arduous battles of the Volunteer Army, without internal support and with exhausted supplies. The Volunteer Army was sacrificed and defeated under the pressure of a strong enemy. On the one hand, the author says in the mouth of the soldier Zhao Dan that even hand-to-hand combat must be resisted to the end. On the other hand, he expresses his grief for national affairs with the intellectual's sigh, "Flowing water, fallen flowers, spring is gone." Here, using fallen flowers to set off the defeat of the national war is certainly inappropriate. In the midst of the cruel war, the poet's sighs of fallen flowers and flowing water and the melancholy of a woman in her boudoir can never match the tragedy of the national war. …This sadness of fallen flowers continues until Ah Xuan's death. There are also fallen flowers in the workers' basement and in the hospital. …The sadness continues throughout. However, later he also felt that this was not very good, so in another season of fallen flowers, the war clouds in North China are urgent. The soldiers go to the front line again, coming to a positive ending that is the opposite of sadness. However, this positivity disappears in the sad atmosphere, that is to say, sadness is the main thing the author describes, and the positive ending is just to show that he has no choice but to do so.</p>
<p>In some minor details, we may be able to see some degree of progress in the author, such as in "The Big Wind," where the wind is used symbolically to satirize the hypocrisy of gentlemen and ladies, while in "Fallen Blossoms," he uses the printing workers to tear up the gorgeous evening gowns. However, in terms of expression techniques, the author is still unable to go beyond the scope of intellectuals. He is not familiar with high society, just as he is not familiar with lower-class life. He relies entirely on his own imagination, plus the inherent romanticism, so he cannot give people any sense of reality. Perhaps we admit that he progressed more smoothly in "Remarriage," because it only wrote about familiar things that intellectuals have experienced. He cannot organize the plot more rigorously, and like "The Big Wind," the front and back are not connected, such as suddenly writing about a fashion company from the basement, which the audience does not understand at all. In addition, the several flashbacks and backstories are unfamiliar to the general audience. Xu Lai's scars, besides the business-minded display, we don't know the source of the scars. …There is no need to say more.</p>
<p>In short, in "Fallen Blossoms," because the author has not clearly defined the personalities of the characters in the play, except that Zhao Dan knows how to act and is very energetic, there is not much achievement in terms of acting skills.</p>

<p>— Wen Ying</p>
<p>Produced by Paramount Pictures, starring Marlene Dietrich</p>
<p>Concha is a famous Spanish dancer. She has unparalleled beauty. Her clear autumn eyes have caused many men to lose their souls. Her clear, oriole-like voice still lingers in their ears after their pasts have become like smoke. But she is ultimately a fleeting cloud in their eyes, elusive, because Concha is beautiful but heartless, using love as a game and beauty as a hook to attract men and women.</p>
<p>I don't know how many hundreds or thousands of people have passed through her life. She doesn't remember their names clearly. They all admired her and fell at her slender feet, but when she fell out of favor, she didn't bother to kick them. She showed them one by one that she was tired of them. She shrugged her fragrant shoulders, revealing a "I am tired and want to sleep, you can leave" expression. The lover of last night has now awakened from a dream, realizing that the good times cannot be kept, and retreats.</p>
<p>But one of them was unwilling to be slighted, unwilling to be summoned and dismissed like the others. He was Don Pasquale. He was tall and strong, and his temperament was violent, but he had a deep love for Concha and was willing to die for love. His family was noble and he held an important position in the military. Concha felt that his position and wealth could be used, so she often pretended to be amorous, and Pasquale was infatuated and obeyed her every command. In this way, Concha and her greedy mother took from him without asking, and Pasquale obeyed their every command in order to win the beauty's heart.</p>
<p>Although Pasquale's family was wealthy, how could it withstand Concha's insatiable demands? After a period of time, Pasquale had reached the point where his money was running out, and he was helpless. Not only was his wealth exhausted and his family ruined, but he also lost his reputation and could no longer serve in the military. His military position had to be resigned because of this. After this disillusionment, his love turned into hatred. He vowed to use the rest of his life to warn other young people to stay away from the snake-hearted dancer.</p>
<p>It was the Carnival in Andalusia, and a guest from afar had arrived. He was a handsome young man with a beautiful face. His name was Antonio Galván. He should not have set foot on Spanish soil, because he was wanted by the government for promoting republicanism and inciting revolution, and had fled the country. This time, because he missed his mother so much, he disguised himself and risked his life to return home to see her. He was walking down the street with flags waving and flowers blooming, when suddenly he saw an unparalleled beauty. He couldn't help but stare at her in fascination, and his breathing stopped.</p>
<p>That's right, the woman he saw was none other than the red dancer of Spain, Concha. She was sitting in a magnificent carriage and sped past Antonio. In a state of confusion, Antonio unknowingly followed closely behind her carriage, all the way to her house.</p>
<p>Strangely, Concha was not angry when she saw the handsome young man, but was rather happy, because it was her favorite thing to have such a handsome young man fall in love with her at first sight. He didn't know that this was Concha's old trick of hooking new romances. He begged her to agree to meet him again tomorrow afternoon. She readily agreed.</p>
<p>The next day, Antonio was about to keep his appointment, but he unexpectedly ran into Pasquale. Because Pasquale was also an old friend of his, Antonio told Pasquale all about his adventure during their conversation. (To be continued)</p>
