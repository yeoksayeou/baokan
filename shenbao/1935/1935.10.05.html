<h3>意方宣布對阿作戰　北路軍全綫推進　白黑聯隊侵入阿境十二哩　砲火猛烈阿杜華危在旦夕</h3>
<p>（羅馬）此間外部正式發表、意國東菲辦事大員今日宣布愛立特及意屬索馬里已入戰爭狀態、此為該兩方面意阿軍業已數度接觸之結果、此項宣布雖不能即視為宣戰、然亦足表示意國政府已正式承認軍事行動業已開始，此與一九三一年日軍侵略滿洲之不宣而戰情形如出一轍，（三日國民電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）意國駐東菲辦事大員台波諾將軍已正式宣布對阿開戰布吿文中謂毘連阿比西尼亞北部之愛立特利之意軍已牽命渡馬勒白河、此舉志在保安、文中繼責阿政府違背一切條約、意軍今所取之步驟乃為和平起見、文末勸吿民衆鈸靜勿擾羅馬亦已正式承認意飛機猛轟阿杜華之舉、聞墨索軍尼之壻齊亞諾所率之飛機支隊作偵察飛行時、曾為阿兵射擊、該隊卒進至阿杜華、砲台乃向發砲、意飛機因以炸彈轟擊砲位、砲台發砲雖多意飛機無一中彈、紅十字醫院一所為炸彈擊中之說意當局指為毫無根據、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）頃自有力方面得悉、東菲意軍將不宣而戰、繼續前進、其籍口則為阿比西尼亞之「侵略態度」使意軍不得不先發制人、以安愛立特里及索馬里兩屬地、並聞墨索里尼現以大事已定、自以為可「高枕而臥」矣、蓋墨氏自信英法將一任意軍完成其東菲計畫而不摧毀意國權力以致牽　歐洲和平云、（三日國民電）</p>
<p>愛立特利意軍前綫　黑種阿斯加里軍隊與白種意大利軍隊已一齊向前、衝入阿境，此輩黑種軍士幾為活動之火藥庫、携有機關槍。短銃·手槍·及大刀等等軍器、開入阿境之時、且以土語高唱「誓割阿皇之鬚、製成小刷、以刷墨索里尼之靴」云、此次進攻之首次報吿皆稱戰事順利、完全與原定計劃合符云、（二日國民電）</p>
<p>阿京　意阿兩軍今日相持於阿杜華之綫、現仍在激戰中、意空軍猛劇轟炸、未足撼動阿軍軍心、意軍步兵以機關槍隊及坦克車為助、現正攻擊梅巴利亞及阿克森、並已佔領拉馬山、意軍司令部今日戰報、謂意軍已突進阿境十亡英里、第一日之目的地己達、（四日國民電）</p>
<p>阿斯馬拉　據今日前綫消息、意軍已深入阿境十二哩、佔據達里白台克爾、其地高出海平六千六百呎、控制十二哩外之阿杜華凹形高原、意軍於飛機猛轟阿杜華鎭後、各種隊伍於昨日拂曉渡過急流之馬勒白河、軍容甚為美觀、前鋒由衣白之愛立特利騎隊為導、當馬匹過橋之際、彼等之軍備皆鏗然作聲、繼以士黃色制服之步隊、滿置機關槍之輕快坦克車、車聲轔轔、隨行隊中、其次為野戰砲與載輕重之運重汽車、天空則有飛機翱翔偵察、以防敵軍之埋伏、阿軍因奉命勿作鏖戰、故未抵禦、意軍入阿所經之路為新築成者、但可供汽車駛行、晚間出發之前、阿斯馬拉與諾迦狄斯西沃二鎭皆張燈結綵、極為興奮、居民行於道中、多唱愛國歌、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>阿京　聞意阿兩軍曾在北方山地要隘蒂格里北鏖戰、意軍有飛機隊掩護、據阿當局聲稱、意軍業已敗退，同時意軍仍向阿國東北隅茅薩阿里山附近多瘴之平原前進、未遭抵抗該方阿軍現伏於華洛山谷，以待與敵交鋒、聞今日參加轟擊阿杜華鎭者，共有意飛機四十架，各險要地點現皆安置高射砲、阿京滿播戰爭之空氣、外人商界頗形驚惶、但阿人仍甚鎭靜、今員釋放獄囚七千人、派往前綫、京中現有騎步警察五千人担任保護、聞意使署人員或將被覊於阿京以為質、（三日路透電）</p>
<p>阿京　自北東南三路進攻之馬達化意軍、於轟炸機猛炸邊境要隘阿杜華及阿狄格拉後、已於今日威迫阿軍前哨退却、死傷人數至今尙無確報但此　得悉、共死一千七百人、約當阿朴華居民三分之一，婦孺與十兵相率葬身於炸彈之下、此間外國使節聞此慘無人道之舉大為震驚、阿政府現正採取種種計割保護京城、外僑數十人深懼飛機夜襲、現已逃出京城、加巴達將軍率領阿軍五萬人趕往茅薩里山、旋接該地來電、報告發生劇戰、可知該軍已與敵軍接觸、此間官方報吿意軍進攻之路綫如下、（一）自阿斯馬拉進取阿杜華、（二）侵入阿格米省、（三）洎茅薩里山進攻、（四）自華爾華爾進攻、索馬里邊境現有步哨接觸戰、該地酋長準備親率敢死馬隊二萬五千人以遏阻意軍坦克車及鐵甲車之前進、此間自昨日下動員令後、兵士叢集街中、雖缺乏近代戰爭智識、但均準備慷慨赴敵、動員令由獵鷹傳送全國邊境各地（四日路透社電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）今日據公報宣稱、阿比西尼亞之戰事刻正在進行中、陸軍師團黑衫隊及菲兵已於昨日越邊、沿廣二十基洛米達之陣綫、經險阻之山境而前進、一路未受抗拒、居民紛持白旗歡迎意軍、民衆現皆處於極困難狀態中、意軍曾以糧食散給之、空軍曾在阿杜華南之瑪加爾與太加齊河外從事偵察、並擲下糧食與宣傳之傳單、阿杜華與阿狄格拉特之阿軍曾以來福槍與砲隊猛轟、意軍以轟炸飛機兩分隊應付之、意軍乘夜鞏固新佔之陣地、黎明時復沿愛台特維全陣綫前進、士氣甚壯、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>阿京　今日阿杜華附近之阿軍以高射砲擊落意飛機一架、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>阿京　今晚此間得悉、阿國著名領袖阿伊呂氏現率軍一萬三千人由阿杜華西面攻入意屬伊利特里、聞其前鋒已佔據意軍之哨營、（四日路透電）</p>

<p>阿京　阿軍在阿迦尼與阿狄格拉特兩處附近失利、惟决計在阿克森死守、該處惡戰正在進行中、衆料阿杜華司令純因意空軍之轟擊、放棄其陣地、但確信彼必能將全軍安然撤後、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>愛立特利意軍前綫　國之東菲大軍今日自陸空兩路攻入阿比西尼亞、第一目標在於北方之阿杜華及阿狄格拉、但坦克車運輸車上之粉筆字、表示進攻之最後目標在阿京轟炸機飛逾一萬一千呎之高山及翱翔阿杜華並無困難、北路總司令狄朋諾將軍已將其司令部移近前綫、阿國人民是否接有進攻之警吿、今尙未悉、意軍數萬今日繼續南下、（三日國民電）</p>

<p>阿京　昨日意飛機之猛轟阿杜華鎭、當時與事後之景象、見者為之心酸、許多兵士之婦孺當其夫駐於鎭外營中之際、而已死於非命、意飛機低飛於該鎭天空、從事擲彈、聞未受高射砲之轟擊、因阿杜華列為不設防之鎭也、毘連意屬索瑪里之阿國南部沃迦登省、迄今未有戰事消息傳來、惟據蒂格里之總督伊育姆來電報吿、阿杜華北面之意軍現方發砲猛轟、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>阿京　此間今日消息、阿比西尼亞不擬正式宣戰、並聞柴那湖附近已集有阿國步兵三十五萬人、其中有手持長矛者、其他分散各地之小組軍隊、已奉命開往索馬里邊境、阿國軍隊雖經嚴令力避正面戰爭、惟據稱、多數戰士皆樂於流血、故天概有不少軍隊將不顧此項命令、（三日國民電）</p>
<p>阿京　此間外僑多已逃往附近山中、以防意軍飛機淸晨轟炸、阿國陸軍部曾正式否認意軍在索馬果前綫獲勝、同時阿皇已釋放全國囚犯、俾得效命疆塲、觀察者估計此舉復能增加戰十數千、據此間接得未蹬實之消息、法屬索馬里之東奧薩省中現亦發生大戰云、（三日國民電</p>

<p>欵里達華　意飛機刻由東北之茅薩阿里山達華洛境之台西、沿途拋擲炸彈、達那基爾部落之民衆、大都從未見過飛機、皆不勝震慄、（四日路透電）</p>

<p>阿京　阿皇昨日頒佈總動員命令之終、全國將有一百萬人開始集中、此輩雖奉令隻身遄往前綫、但仍當携帶眷屬同行、監獄囚犯業巳釋出、任何人凡不遵令入伍者、卽當予以槍决、阿國人服務于意國使館者均向國皇表示忠順、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>有阿軍四五萬集中　拔海千尺行軍困難</p>
<p>阿京　哈瓦斯社特派員所得消息、阿國軍隊約有四五萬人集中河杜華附近一帶、因此主管方面認竟國軍隊不致未經開火、卽行佔領該地、綠阿杜華周圍地方、為阿國古代帝皇陵寢所在地、阿國人民奉為聖地、如意軍由此處進犯、阿國軍隊、勢必竭全力守衛、且意軍渡過阿比西尼亞邊界之馬勒河後、向阿杜華進發、中間幾無道路可通、軍隊必須用大隊爬山汽車、攀登海拔一千公尺之高地、歷六十公里之距離、沿途無法採辦飲水糧食、故大軍所至、必隨帶充足糧秣、由爬山汽車載之登山、兵士每連、必須有臚子多頭各駝容量五十公升之皮質水瓶一具、兵士每名則須自携飲水二公升、行軍困難、由此可想見也（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>阿京　阿國南北境現皆在鏖戰中、意軍恃其戰器之精利、已在兩處陣綫得手、阿政府花式承認北部蒂格里境總督西育姆之軍隊在阿杜華附近大受挫衂、又據哈拉爾消息、南部沃迦登省今晨曾見激戰、阿兵死二千人、傷者亦多、（四日路透電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>歐洲風雲與米美爾問題</h3>
<p>— 緯</p>
<p>二次大戰的序幕可以說已經揭開了。近月來。日內瓦熱中和平的各國外交家們。對意阿爭端。力謀和平解决之道東菲前綫第一聲砲響。終於驚醒了他們的迷夢。他們目前放棄了和平的希望。正在找尋聯手來應付當前的敵人。英國要求法國予以海上的援助來對付意國。而法國亦曾要求英國保障中歐的和平。以防德國的南下。其他有偉大的野心的政治家。走上戰爭之路的。則聚精會神。鬥智鬥力於軍事方面。以求獲得目前的勝利。未走上戰爭之路的。則縱橫稗闔於外交方面。以求獲得未來的勝利。所以在一方面。右些國家認定這是他們的生死關頭。在他方面。又右些國家認定這是擴張他們領土獲得權益的好機會。</p>
<p>在南歐。意大利掀起了戰爭的洶湧波濤。而在北歐。德意志却靜待時機。想要達其混水摸魚的目的。當目前意大利已無暇注意她一向視為禁　的奧匈的時候。千載一時的機會。國社黨認為又到臨了德國。我們又見德國外交家在東歐的活動。德波十年不侵犯的條約的訂立。使波蘭一躍而從法國的衛星變為德國的「與國。」現在希特勒復乘匈總理貢博斯遊德之便。有所密商。並與奧國有訂立五年不侵犯條約之說。這目的不用講。是在組織德波奧匈集團。以與中歐小恊約集團及東歐波羅的海集團——立陶宛拉脫維亞愛沙尼亞——相對抗。</p>
<p>國社黨之視波羅的海為其囊中物。早已在國社黨代言人羅森培的計畫中。不獨國社黨宣傳的小冊子。時常分佈這三國境內。並且國計黨徒的活動時常足為三國現政府的威脅。因此這三個國家。自國社黨執政以來一變。其畏懼蘇聯的心理。而畏懼德國。三國為防衛其共同敵人起見。有波羅的公約的簽訂。該約主要的內容是在規定三國外交應有一共同立塲。與三國外長每年應會商一次。來决定主要的外交政策。以對付外來的侵略。不過這些規定根本是政治的。而不是軍事的。假使國社黨發揮其「東向政策。」這三國能否一致對付。及三國能否有這力量對付。自是疑問。德國的待機而動。目前已成公開事實。其表現於米美爾問題上的態度尤。為明顯。德國對立陶宛的特別仇視。自有其特殊原因。然而其主要的目的。還是在擴張領土。所以凡阻止她這種野心的國家。卽是其所仇視的國家。立陶宛不過首當其衝。而米美爾也不過是其開端吧了。</p>
<p>米美爾之成為國社黨集中的目標。是由於米美爾戰前本屬於德。戰後由國聯統治。一九二三年。米美爾為立陶宛實行占。領一九二匹年。英日意法四國代表會商於巴黎。承認立國的主權。惟同時却給予米美爾相當限度的自治權力。該地有議會一。由地方民衆選舉議員充任。有總督一。由立陶宛委派。總督與議會。常起齟齬。當地人民對於立國感情。亦極惡劣。此種現象。實足為德國反立陶宛的藉口。故當今年春薩爾投票歸德後。德國卽有將米美爾仿蔭爾例舉行投票歸德的口號。事實上米美爾的地位。决不宜與薩爾等視。然在德人心目中。固無暇及此。蓋收米美爾為己有。乃其唯一目的也。此次地方議會選舉國。社黨之目的。卽在多獲議員。一舉而推翻立國的統治。選舉現已結束。不過結果尙小可知。在立陶宛員不能坐視其已獲的領土。再為他人所獲。而在德國。認為米美爾歸德國乃絕無疑義之事。雙方對於此點卽無妥協之可能。而國際風雲。又使保障未美爾歸立國的意法英日等國都難免於捲入游渦。無暇顧及立國的痛癢。所以米美爾問題的前途是黯淡的。而且這不但是立陶宛一國或是波羅的海諸國的問題。還是關係全世界和平的問題。</p>

<p>（巴黎）此問今日消息、法國須先成立英法空軍聯盟、然後允許英國、在未經挑釁而受意國或其他國家海軍方面攻擊時予以援助英國不管部大臣艾登聞已奉令通知法國、謂現在之意阿衝突、不能卽據為籍口、强迫英國與法締結此項條約、以反對歐洲之侵略國家、再據可靠方面消息、英國官塲雖已着手研究應否禁止意國軍艦通過蘇彝士運河、惟目前尙無封銷運河禁止一切船隻通過之表示云、（三日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）國聯事務大臣艾登回國與政府協　接、已取道巴黎、前往日內瓦、艾登已奉密令、堅持施行制裁、對付　壞國聯盟約之任何國家、（三日國民社電）</p>

<p>亞歷山大利亞此間當道接東菲戰事業已發作之消息後、卽諭令警察集於重要地點、並諭令本鎭準備意外變端、並派軍警駐於電綫出海之海綫局、所有意藉警察已於一星期前繳出武裝（三日路透電）</p>

<p>（華盛頓）國務總理赫爾與國務院巳草擬宣佈禁止軍火出口之令文、一俟東菲狀態經正式徵實後、卽擬呈請羅總統批准之、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）國務總理赫爾今日表示、美國對於意阿兩國禁運軍火、務須俟局勢分明之後、始能實行、故在未得正式報吿、證實戰事確已開始之前、美國政府大概不致有何舉動、目前國務院尙未接得此項報吿、惟政府自亦有其中心思想、卽遵守中立是也、赫氏並稱、迄今並無他國向美國諮詢對於施行制裁之態度、按以前倫敦消息、曾謂英國外部準備咨詢美國、據觀察者之意、美國或將在憲法及法律範圍以內、盡量與國聯合作、維持世界和平云、（三日國民電）</p>

<p>（東京）今日外務省發言人不允批評國聯將制裁意國之說、亦不能預言日本對於國聯將來之抉議將作何種行動、但謂必須待時局之明瞭、發言人答新聞記者之問話、謂意阿戰事發生、日本將依據國際公約負中立國之完全責任日本非國聯曾員國、故對國聯不負任何義務、國聯須由國聯會員國自已維護之、如維護國聯盟　而須恃非會員國之合作則國聯之存在、可謂繫於非會員國矣、（四日路透電）</p>

<p>武漢是記者舊遊之地、那時還在二十年大水災以前遺留我的腦子裏的深刻印象是四多、第一是標讀多、琳琅滿目、各色具備、第二是皮帶多、威風凜凜、坐洋車可以不化錢、第三是殺人多由中山路至六波橋一帶、幾乎每天都可以看到槍斃人的佈吿、第四是鴉片館和娼妓多、各地林立、無惡不作、此次舊地重來、覺得情形、已有些變更、琳琅滿目的標語雖依然到處可以看見、相都是新生活的標幟、新生活的標語「明禮義、知廉恥、負責任、守紀律」是最時髦的口號、「簡單、樸素、確實、迅速、」是新生活上的敎條、可是不幸得很、這種標語、並不能收到若何巨大的效果、近幾天來、武漢當局、正為着標語的外交糾紛而煞費苦心、這可見標語也不能和以前一樣隨便張貼的了</p>
<p>皮帶的威風、雖比以前也着實减了一些可是警察的威風却代　了皮帶的威風、槍斃人的事件據調査所得似乎也少見、這些可以說是比較進步的現象、</p>
<p>自新生活運動實施以來、漢口的烟館和娼妓、表面上似乎少了一些、從前那種沿街賣烟槍、到處開烟館的情形、經過了嚴厲的取締以後、已不輕易看見、可是熟悉個中情形者、仍能縷舉無遺、據談、目前當局的禁烟政策、是着重寓禁於徵、每年稅收約可達一千萬元左右、期在數年以內、完全禁絕、娼妓自禁娼以來、大名遷往法租界、法租界當局、於妓女身上徵收苛重的妓捐增加一批極大的收入目下法租界新設旅館頗多營業大　還不差、反之、　界的大小旅館、類皆門可羅雀、</p>
<p>此外還有一種幾年來發生的特殊現象、便是勞動力代價的低廉、卽以人力車資而論若將武漢三鎭的人力車　海市的人力車相較、前者比後者幾低廉一倍左右往往四五里路畏的路程其代價不過四五分、而洋車夫尙你搶我奪　（平均除租金外每日約可得二角左右、（記者初　岸時車夫為了搶一角錢的生意、三五同夥幾至互相動武、結果連記者的手上、血跡斑斑，我們如果往他們的身上一看、那副鳩形鵠面、骨瘦如柴的樣子、又使我們發生無限的同情、至於一般老弱的失業　民和婦女、其生活之慘酷、聞更有甚於此者、</p>
<h3>魯東　煤商情求救濟</h3>

<p>動物節徵求大會（啟昌攝）</p>
<p>主席報告</p>
<p>山、　　開會、行禮如儀後、首由主席葉恭綽致開會詞云、諸位來賓、諸位會員、今天世界動物節、本會利用機會、喚起國民對保護動物之注意、世界動物節主旨、在人類仁愛動物、動物能力雖不及人類、然人類不能因此儘量虐待、數十年來、世界許多慈善家學術　、從學術上和觀念上的見地、感覺動物不能保護自己、人類應加以保護、是以世界各國、有聯合保護動物之組織、我國有斯組織、才及二年、社會人士、雖同情者居多、而抱冷淡態度者亦不乏人，此由於一、般同胞對保護動物、無深切之認識、一年來、　本會宗旨表同情者漸增、山同情而喚起社會注意、由汪意而明瞭護生的意義、目輿論方面、熱烈表示同情、今日紀念之外、同時開徵求會員大會、各大報亦極力贊助、本會深引爲幸、且行政院、內政部、已元本會請求、明令全國禁屠一天、此不僅政府表示同情和重視、月予以協助、尤爲慶幸、惟本會應作之事、因種種困難、未能充分實現、希望熱心諸位、合力協助本會完成使命云、</p>
<p>關炯之詞</p>
<p>近來有許多人、覺得現在的世界、是人與人互相殘殺的世界、人類中間的恐慌、一天比一天厲害、我們自己尙且來不及、那裏能够談得上保護其他的動物、這句話似乎很對、實在是錯　、我們至少有兩個理由、可以答復他們、第一、人類是有聰明才力的動物、受到環境壓迫的時候、可以用自己的力量救護自已、其他的動物的聰明才力、比人類差得多、遇到受人類殘害的時候、只有寃沈海底、無可抵抗、動物的聰明才力、雖有高下不同、可是生命的寳貴、並沒有兩樣、所以這般弱小的生命、是需要人類保護的、第二、人類傷害動物的習慣、就是養成人類殘殺的主因、一定造成世界不安的惡果、好比小孩子、從小會殺虫子、長大了就容易殺雀子·殺貓·殺狗·甚至於殺人、也不覺得希奇、所以求人類和平的根本辦法、首先應當改造人類的心理、幾年前、歐洲提倡蔬食會的主席、說過一句話、他說「若要世界上不流血、先從我們吃飯的桌子上不流血起、」這句話、是很有意義的、我想熱心世界和平的人們、對於這個根本方　、總該不至於不贊成吧、</p>
<p>報告會名</p>
<p>繼由理事李經緯報吿會務、甲、組織方面、（一）積極謀充實力量、開始徵求會員、（二）籌設各地分會、已成立者計陝西之西安、長安二處、在籌備中者、計北平·長沙·蘇州等地、乙·宣傳方面、（一）除一年一度舉行宣傳大會外、並先商得新聞報同意、不定期出版本會特刊其他各報在接洽中、（二）本年夏季曾特印製護生文字圖書扇一萬把、分送各界、（三）本年四月八日至十三日、會聯合西人反對虐待動物會、舉行保護動物宣傳週丙·事業方面·禁止各地殺耕牛、此外如禁殺田鷄、野狗、並呈請行政院通令全國、於今日禁屠一天、</p>
<p>童行白詞</p>
<p>次市黨部代表章行白致詞、略謂、保護動物四字、雖似最近幾年方聽到、殊不知我國早有保護動物之思想、即孔子所說忠恕之道、總理所說仁愛精神、戰保護動物、在意義上是道德問題、在歷史上是人類進化問題、何故須保護動物、因人類愛生怕死、動物亦愛生怕死、人類求延長壽命、動物亦然、在道德上、人類愛以愛護向已之心、推而及於動物、孟子說、「推恩足以保生、」親親而仁愛、　一理也、就人類進化史上言之、則過去野蠻時代人類之生活方式、爲鬥爭殘殺、當今二十世紀文明時代、人類生活方式、應有合理之改革動物節、雖起源於歐美、然我國亦早有此思想、此後希望人類與人類之間、應有理生、　互　愛、並推及動物云、尙有衛生局王濬昌·喇賴法師·及西人保護動物會代表蓓情等相繼致詞、意義不同、從　、</p>
<p>來賓演說</p>
<p>次各界演說、王曉範演說、略謂人類　動物之一、且爲萬物之靈、但人不應因其爲萬物之靈、而對於其他划物、加以殘殺、是則保護動物、乃人類所應盡之道德、苟能做到保護動物、則將來世界上、便可沒有殘殺的事情發生、錫蘭法師奈賴淡演說、略謂、保護動物會之組織份子、多爲佛敎徒、此余所最喜者、去世界各敎敎義中、對於保護動物、有共同之認識、即以中國人所崇拜之孔子而言、渠對於保護動物、亦有許多之名言、我人希望能使世界、對於保護動物、有切實之進行辦法、則人類之幸福、更有增進、末由太虛法師演說、略謂保護動物、在佛敎中極爲軍視、佛經上對於動物稱爲情生、所謂情生者、乃有情感之生物也、蓋凡爲動物均有避死好生惡勞好逸的心理、則我人豈能以自已所不忍的、而以加之以動物身上、故希望各界均能體察此情、而使全人類均有保護動物之心理云、</p>
<p>鍾氏答詞</p>
<p>最後由理事鍾可託致辭　盒　云、今天承黨政　關派員指導、各界來賓蒞臨參加、並蒙印度錫蘭佛敎會代表喇頓法帥、及西人保護動物會蓓蕾小姐、光臨指導、非常榮幸感謝、本會决本斯旨繼續工作、希各方執熱心贊助、隨時指示一切、末全體合攝影、隨即開始表演遊藝、所排節目、如郵務工會之國樂演奏、仁惠小學之　劇、及明月歌劇社白虹、黎明健等之歌舞、殊多精彩、博得掌聲不少、迄晚七時、始奏樂散會、</p>

<h3>昆蟲學家談　閔行瘧疾防止</h3>

<p>癖蚊狀態</p>
<p>瘧病之流行、厥由瘧蚊之傳播瘧蟲、是爲更人皆知、至瘧蚊形態、可以下列數端鑑別、其觸無鬚雌雄、皆與口器幾相等、或正等、長口器則向前伸出、與體軸呈一直綫、當其棲息時、常與所在平面呈一角度、在垂直之牆上、則所呈之角度、爲三十度左右、翅有斑蚊、飛不作聲、</p>
<p>本市無妨</p>
<p>自閔行發生瘧疾以後、本埠人士、深恐受其傳染、實則瘧蚊並非善於飛翔、通常計算、無過一百碼、從未見瘧蚊、飛過、英哩之遙者、本埠　閔行距離、寗止一哩、明乎此、即知本埠决不致受閔行瘧蚊之影響、而爲害吾人健康也、</p>
<p>防治一斑</p>
<p>關於防治方法頗多、第須顧及鄕村環境、就其簡而易行者、莫若用木鋸、或糠、或稻柴灰、散布各種汚水中、則可使瘧　或造蚊之孑孓窒死、一方並足遏止蚊之下卵、至惠瘧之治療自以服金鷄納霜丸、殺害寄生蟲、至未患與已患之注意隔離、此爲通常疾病均然、冊待贅也云</p>

<h3>無痛苦戒湮？</h3>
<p>— 鈍根</p>
<p>戒煙的人最怕痛苦、他當一初因爲求免病的痛苦，纔吸上了了癮，現在一心想戒，口是受不了痛苦，（一）舊病復發的痛苦，（二）新病增加的庸苦，（因戒煙而發生的腰痠，腿軟，背脊抽筋，胃痛，肚疼，口乾，喉燥，肝旺，眼紅，流淚，垂涕，呵欠，咳嗽，極汗潮熱，遺精，腹瀉，失眠，煩躁，等症，）（三）醫生無經騐，不體恤，藥力不夠，手術生哽，尤其是打針和發泡抽水，</p>
<p>市上的投機醫生多極了，都是自稱「無痛苦戒煙一，可惜這「無痛苦」三個字，被人濫用得信用掃地了，如今就拿發泡抽水來說罷；自從某將軍呌外國醫生用發泡抽水注射戒煙以後，一時風行海上，但凡醫生，都把發泡抽水標榜時髦，賣弄手段，無論他手段如何高妙，恐怕那一發泡」的時候，沒有不痛的吧？我有一位財主朋友，他到某院去戒煙，住着頭等病房、醫生十分巴結他，替他發泡，用一種藥塗在胸前，經過，一日一夜，纔發出狠大的黃水泡來，他說，這一日一夜裏頭，實在痛不可當，好比舊有十法用大蒜搗爛塗裹咬破皮膚起泡出水的情形，一般無二、醫生安慰他，呌他安睡，忘却痛苦，可憐他那裏睡得着，忘得掉、及至泡發足了，用空針抽出黃水，重復注射到血管裏去，又經過兩次抽出打進的痛苦，纔算了事，他事後談起，還帶着痛定思痛的餘悸，他幷且說，抽水注射之後，依然有時反癮，只要抵癮的藥水少喝了些，依然是精神委頓，直到兩個月後，藥水裏頭主要成分抽減凈盡，還同時吃了不少的補品，纔吿成功，所以我知道，戒煙是少不了一漸减一方法的，抽水注射固然是新發明的醫術，但要毫無痛苦，幷且單靠着牠三兩天戒絕，不用旁的輔助品，就可以永不反癮，只怕不是人人辦得到的，（蛋黃素未盛行以前，有許多人用抽水注射法戒了煙，還仗着打補身針，至少一星期，抵抗精神的疲弱），我今掬誠奉告有志戒煙諸同胞，欲求穩健安全，毫無痛苦，還是用「逐漸抽减」法，同時吃蛋黃素爲輔助品，這方法再是如沒有了！因爲吃了蛋黃素，每隔四五天，可以減少圾煙十分之二，减到最後，就是穩健些，從十分之二減爲十分之一。從十分之一減爲百分之五，從百分之五减爲百分之二·五，從此直到完全斷煙，（吞泡，吃土，打嗎啡針者，亦可照此減法），雖然有幾位或者覺得身體疲軟，儘可以打一兩星期的蛋黃素針，這蛋黃素注射劑，注射的時候，並無大痛苦，不過像政蟲咬了一口，若是發泡抽水往射，這痛苦就大了，諸位！我並不是醫生，不要兜攬戒煙生意，這話是忠實公正無偏的。因爲體貼戒煙同胞身體虛弱怕受痛苦喜歡緩戒的心理，所以貢獻這一些經騐之談，諸位如能即日服用蛋黃素，開始抽減煙量，還可以赶得上年內戒絕，免却官廳勒戒的不自由。</p>
<h3>鴉片掌故</h3>
<p>— 蔣得奇</p>
<p>郭集芬之笑柄</p>
<p>淸光緒季年。郭集芬以道員需次浙江。一度爲溫處鹽釐局總辦。以短收正額。欠解餘欵。被參革職。增子固撫浙。查悉短收係迫於天時。欠解乃困於人力。情有可原。奏復其官。甫一載而增又以其吸食鴉片。奏參褫職矣。當郭之入禁煙公所調騐也。貼絕大之膏藥於肛門之上。其膏乃煙膏而非藥膏。故事官吏入調騐所。自項至踵。所有衣屨鞋韈。甚至一帶之微。均須易以官有之物。郭易褲時。委員見其肛門貼膏藥。異而詰之。郭曰。此用以治痔瘡者。委員揭下審視。曰。此頗似煙膏。應留以化騐。郭力辨。委員不得已。仍令貼之。嚴密監察其舉動。然此煙膏。既經貼於痔瘡之上。已汚穢不堪。亦决不能進口矣。法定期限爲一星期。郭之第二日。已力不能支。哀求監視員。謂苟容其吞食煙丸。堅守秘密。不吝萬金爲酬。委員以情陳總辦。郭計不得逞。乃具結承認吸煙。即日出所。總辦呈撫院。依例議以褫職處分矣。</p>
<p>咸豐帝制脫癮</p>
<p>淸咸豐時。鴉片之禁漸弛。其時大僚中多有染其癖者。即帝亦酷嗜此物。英法聯軍入京。帝北狩然河。驚恐之餘。又以癮發。遂至大漸。蓋其時帝以食猝蒙塵。少帶阿芙蓉。帝又憤以鴉片之戰。致外兵深入。深悔已翻受其毒。故决絕戒除。不意竟以此致疾也。嗚乎。鴉片之毒。痛於四海。而當日以九五之尊。亦以此戕其性命。可勝痛哉。</p>
<p>絕妙聯語</p>
<p>吾鄕潘凱聲學士。文才恣肆。拓　不親。生平染烟癖甚深。嘗撰二聯。鄕人至今傳誦。用資談助。其一云。『口吹無洞之簫何時引鳳』。「手握不毛之筆終日塗鴉」其二云。「燈光不比文光偏能射斗』。「洋藥非同火藥也可開鎗」。</p>

<p>（一）有仿雲南大親樓聯，嘲吸鴉片者云，「五百兩煙泥，賒來手裏，價廉貨淨，喜洋洋興趣無窮，看粵誇黑土，楚重紅　，黔尙靑山，滇崇白水，估成辨色，不妨請客閑評，趁火旺爐然，煮就了魚泡蟹眼，正更畏夜永，安排些雪藉冰桃，莫孤負四稜饗斗，萬字香盤，九節老槍，三襄玉嘴』，數千金家產，忘卻心頭，續發神疲，咲滾滾　財何用，想名類巴菰，膏珍福壽，程傳罌粟，花號芙蓉，橫枕開燈，足盡平生樂事，儘朝吹暮吸，那怕他日烈潮寒，縱妻怨兒啼，都裝作天聾地啞，只剩下幾寸囚毛，半邊肩膀，二行涕淚，一副枯骸」，</p>
<p>（二）有套城隍廟聯，爲煙館製聯云，「任憑爾無法無天，到此大　發時，還有力否」，「須知我不賒不欠，且把畏槍放下，快數錢來」，</p>
<p>（三）某書生有煙癖，嘗作聯自嘲云，「一　橫陳，那管他地裂天崩，海枯石爛」，「半生虛度，總有日煙消火滅，油盡燈乾」，</p>
<p>（四）有嘲在家祠中設燈售吸者云，「與祖宗呼吸相通，方是香煙一脈」，「咲子孫詩書未讀，也知燈火三更」，</p>
<p>（五）有以集句作煙　云「重　不捲留香久」，「短笛無腔信口吹」，</p>
<p>（六）又一聯嘲吸者云，「無制早擎居喪杖，未亡先點倒頭燈」，</p>

<h3>鴉片之害（仿新蘇灘）</h3>
<p>— 俞夢江</p>
<p>說起鴉片這樣害人……精，害得唔呢老百姓，財窮身弱好可恨！自從傳流到如今。民族顚危的大原因！淸朝出了個林則徐，要把鴉片煙來禁！他說是。。鴉片盛行十年後，國內無處籌餉銀，如果傳流百年後，國內無有可用的兵，可恨斷命英國人，就此開戰動刀兵，恨只恨西太后與李鴻章，懦弱無能怕戰爭，只好是割地來賠欽，不平等的條約來訂定，這就是亡國滅種的禍殃根，你想痛恨不痛……恨。（過門）</p>
<p>有人說，有錢的吸煙不要……緊，只要難爲幾假洋塌餅，淸膏大土白銅燈，收膏的時候用人參，嬌妻美妾來服侍，噴雲吐霧變仙人，但不過這個芙蓉城一進，甜盡苦來在後跟，用脫兩錢是小事，身弱多病接連生，今日請醫生。明日要打嗎啡針，挑挑醫生多做生意……經，（過門）</p>
<p>要知道鴉片含有嗎啡毒，祇能暫時來興奮，一時果然神仙樂，日久就會變毛病，神昏顚倒無畫夜，大便秘結苦煞人，父母生我這六尺體，終身殘廢眞可憫，或許是萬般的事業一旦傾，或許是萬貫的家財一口……吞。（過門）</p>
<p>我偏說：無錢的吸煙更可……憐，費時失業過光陰，古人說：「一寸光陰一寸金，寸金難買寸光陰」！豈非是大好的時光誤終身，有的是受了經濟的大壓迫，妻離予別好傷心。一家人家跑　凈，親戚朋友都不認，只好到燕子窠裏去做　脚身。如果一日來失癮，漏底傷寒見閻君，死脫仔後施村睏，你想可憐不可……憐。（過門）</p>
<p>今日裏奉勸諸公朋友……們，不論貧苦富生意人，總之吸了鴉片煙，海是早早戒斷縮，現在出了一種康樂　，科學方法配製成，裏面含有蛋黃素，營養豐富那馬溫，只要購服一個月，包你斷　蠻太平，從此後一切禍患消干凈，快快活活過……光陰。</p>
<h3>十勸（揚州調梳妝臺）</h3>
<p>— 馮彈鋏</p>
<p>第一勸。首勸種田人。勸農人。戒鴉片。振作精神。我中華。本來是。以農立國。諸農友。兩肩上。責任非輕。胼手復胝足。春耕而夏耘。要知道。盤中餐。粒粒辛動。旣戒吸又戒種。剷除毒卉。方不愧我中國。堂堂好農民。第二勸。再勸衆勞工。諸君的地位。僅亞於農。憑雙手。換金錢。維持生活。又何苦。將血汗。浪酒阿芙蓉。工作抽餘　。努力把書攻。求學識。與技藝。日益精通。憑心思。與智巧。發明新器物。如此才。稱得起。工界英雄。第三勸。三勸衆商人。商人的地位。如日方升世界商塲。競爭正烈。準備着。好身手。角逐此輸贏。將本而求利。操奇而計贏。營業發展。全恃信和誠。輸鉅金。助軍用。榮膺褒獎。（日前報載貝潤生君因助陳英士先生軍需十萬元國府明令嘉獎）如此商人。萬古流芬。</p>
<p>第四勸。敬勸學界諸公。諸公的智識。不比憑蒙。師資固屬居先覺。莘莘學子。亦是未來主人翁。菁義而棫樸。化雨又春風。切不可。吸鴉片。貽玷在黌宮。古人云。君子之過。如同日月食。得央村。而敎育。其樂融融。</p>
<p>第五勸。深勸軍人。安內攘外。責任重無倫。虎頭猿臂封侯相。切不可。吸鴉片。自壞長城。聞鷄而舞劍。投筆請畏纓。要做到立功異域。銅柱銘勛。憑頭顱。與熱血。爲國雪恥。痛飲黃龍酒。掃穴犁庭。</p>
<p>第六勸。婉勸敬言公。諸公的地位。何等優崇。警于前。察于後。安良除暴。不眠不休。口不言功。人心如其面。各各不相同。難免其中有「臥龍」。勸君速出煙霞洞。庶免得。貽人指摘。萬口交攻。</p>
<p>第七勸。敦勸士大夫。學優而什。今古同塗。如今官吏况是稱公僕。四萬萬。主人翁。公等是奚奴。明毅而果决。仁恕復寬和。切不可。吸鴉片。誤入歧途。有則改之無則勉。幡然悔。　然司。滌去舊染之汚。</p>
<p>第八勸。奉勸有錢人。如今金錢。號稱萬能。既稱萬能。川途須審慎。爲什麼。將有用的　鎮。傁最在火上焚。這速戒鴉片。救救貧苦人。種福田。收善果。不差毫分。席豐　履厚。幾生修到。飢無食。寒無衣。一樣是天生。第九勸。苦勸窮黎。予小子。與諸君。一樣栖栖。求衣求食。已屬非容易。又何能吸鴉片。自入泥犁。决心戒嗜。立志莫游移。否極泰來。剝復兆先幾。古今豪優、多年出在寒門裏。切莫要。戀烏煙。終始沉迷。</p>
<p>第十勸。普勸衆同胞。鴉片痛史。拙筆難描。百年間損失。妙算難稽核。只落得。民民貧國弱。風雨漯搖。政府决大計。四載限非遙。從今以後。管敎火滅煙消。更虧那。唐醫師。發明『康樂素』。願伺胞同登『康樂」。其享煕嗥。</p>
<h3>煙室銘</h3>
<p>— 鉢翁</p>
<p>鴉片爲害盡人皆知，茲仿劉禹錫陋室銘，戲作煙室銘一篇，爲嗜烏煙者戒，</p>
<p>量不再大。有　出名。膏不在多。非　不鷄斯是煙室。唯無德馨。煙熏滿面黑。毒竄一身靑。談笑皆　客。往來無壯丁。蓋食蛋黃索。絕煙燈。無痛苦之釋兩。復「康樂」之身形。跳出黑地獄。恢復大光明。醫師云。何難之有，</p>
<h3>改詩</h3>
<p>— 瘦菊</p>
<p>泰縣有一人家，弟兄六七人與虞美人均有密切N交。年深月久，被美人將身上精血及家中財九都吸得化爲烏有，余戲改古詩一首詠之云，」一去二三進。煙燈四五張。弟兄六七個。八四十枝槍』。（按古詩爲「一去二三里。前村兒五家。亨台六七座。八九十枝花。」。舊時產童習字所用描紅簿句也）。</p>
<h3>康樂素緊要聲明</h3>
<p>康樂索用糯米殼裝的一種。（即稱盒裝。每盒二十枚者。）在夏令裏頭。因爲氣候潮濕。以致油質泛出壳外。吞服時和溫水含在口中。一時不易軟化。各地分銷處收藏稍爲不愼。甚至霉壞。現在好了。天氣乾燥。來殼潔白無油。遇水易化。購服者無不稱快。內地願任分銷者。快快來批購推銷罷。富裕之家。可以放心多買幾盒。免却零星購取之煩。還可以得便宜。不很好嗎。</p>
<h3>閱者諸君鹽</h3>
<p>本刊承全國同文不棄。紛紛投稿。多至美不勝收。遂覺租用報紙區區地位。有不能容納之苦。現擬編印雜誌式之定期刊。增加文藝。多載名家小說。衛生專著。每月出版二次。概行贈閱。辱愛諸君。但以通信處見吿。即得贈閱二月。先此預吿。定期再佈。如蒙來函贊成。尤感雅意。小蝶謹啓</p>

<h3>小男兒（六六）</h3>
<p>— 美國奧爾珂德女士原著鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>那天上午當然休課，到了下午那一間受破損的房間已　整理就緒，病人也已好些，才有時間去從容聽取和審理那些小罪犯、乃德和韜摩已說明他們在這件壞事上的份兒，痛悔他們因此而使其所心愛的房舍及其中切的人物瀕於絕險的境地。可是唐恩還是放着這種一那管它一的神氣也不願承認已受了多大的損失。</p>
<p>原來裴先生　最厭恨過於一切的，就在喝酒賭牌和發咒；便是抽紙煙的一件事，他自己也戒絕了，免得孩子們效法，因此他不勝忿怒與愁恨見到他再三忍耐相待的童子竟乘其外出引入這些禁絕的惡行。使他一片純潔的小孩們反以為此等放縱是雄武而爽快的。他召集了這輩童子對他們作一番詳一切的　導，最後卻以堅定定又吟惜的神情說道：</p>
<p>「我想轁摩巳經受了足够的苦楚，他臂上的疤痕可以使共長久記住不再和這些事發生關係。乃德的一番　恐對於他也已够了，因爲他卻已悔恨，並且他確能聽我的括的。但是，你，　恩，我曾　恕過你好幾次，而這對於你竟毫無益處。我不能讓我的孩子爲你的惡榜樣所帶壞，也不願我的時間徒然虛費，說了不被人接受，所以你可以對大家吿別，要納綏把你的東西裝在我的黑皮袋裏。</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （鄭逸梅）</p>
<p>重陽登高，差不多元數千年來的例行故事實在當那　陽時節天字澄淸，氣象爽肅。約三知己，綏步上那的郭的靑山。紅的　　，黄的菊花，左打映發，在在可以駐踪，處處耐人玩賞。偶　茱英，隨意佩挿，那萸香菊氣，熏襲　襟　袍幅之間，　乎忘懷了　也間的一切煩　和　　。歸途過着野店，昂然逕入，據着後面憑窗可以俯視流水的一座，淺斟低酌，談古說今，沒有些兒拘束禁忌，喝得夕陽鴉背，瞑色不浮，始各微醉而歸。眞可謂行樂及時的了。但是老登髙的起源，那續齊諧上說：「費長房令桓景九月九日囊朱萸，登髙以避禍。」可知這一天並不是盡歡行樂的日子，直至後來太守携觴，孟嘉落帽，才一背初旨，借此爲秋遊野宴的機會。</p>
<p>有人說：「今年的水災，自夏入秋，災區廣大，長江泛濫於先，黄河决口於後。田園屋廬，盡付波臣，簡直平地上無可棲身，紛紛的避到山丘林木上去，聊以苟延殘喘。那種變相式的登髙，確乎爲避免災禍而起，和那古人恒景，可　深表同情的了。」</p>
<p>同一登髙，我人何等逍遙，何等快樂。那些避災的，無家可歸，無業可做，餓死凍死，即在目前，又是何等的悽慘，何等苦痛，那麽我人應當怎樣發着惻隱之心，慈善之念，慷慨解囊，藉以賑救呢。</p>
<h3>西施之故里與遺蹟</h3>
<p>— 孫麟昌</p>
<p>西施，誰都知道伊是一個古代的絕世美人，但有人只曉得被越王借伊以沼吳，後來便不知所終，一說是范蠡載了伊同去，實則；伊是殉母而死的。現在我得着舊雨馮君的報吿，把西子的故里遺跡寫在下面，馮君是諸曁人，近水樓臺，語當非虛。</p>
<p>西子的故里，便是苧蘿村，在諸暨縣南門外沿浣江之右，有小嶺，向右逕行，有木牌樓，一上書『古苧蘿村』四字，此郎西子祠之入口處。祠係二間一進之殿，朝南北向，中有龕，塑西施及兩宮女像，龕上四字曰『矢志　他』。西施像居中，手執簡冊，亭亭玉立，狀甚生動，祠側有南廳，顏日『歸眞處』旁有聯云·『託身居浣·明志殉江，一死還太空。在山固淸，出山依然不濁』。『奉命進吳，功成退越，五湖侍老母。於親爲孝，於國益見其忠』。祠廊有二聯，其一爲「生長西施外家，忠故主，孝邁親，是中國無雙奇女」。『關懷東周大局，沼强吳，興殘越，眞全球第一偉人』。其二云：『莫說錢塘蘇小是鄕親，請言其上』。『但稱浣水西施是美女，何足傳眞』。祠後之右有小池，立碑曰『紅粉池』，祠外遙望對溪，竹籬茅舍，叢樹成林，此爲西子村。相傳卽西施之故居，沿溪渡橫塘，有亭翼然，曰『浣紗亭』卽西施投江殉母處也。</p>
<h3>長毛怪小孩之來歷</h3>
<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>閱九月二十日本報第三張一匡仲謀收留遍體長毛怪小孩」之新聞後，爲好奇心所驅使，特赴蓬萊市塲，訪問匡君，蒙其見答收留是孩之經過情形，較本報所載詳盡，爰轉錄如下，以補前次所載之不足。（以下皆匡君所述），是孩係魔術家馬守義於本年八月間在本市塲蓬萊大戲院獻技時所帶來，馬君盛譽，久馳歐美，足跡遍寰瀛，素有怪傑之稱，故一事一物，亦彌學其奇怪也。是孩之生產地，係安徽颕州北三十里之邵家大營，其父名邵振全，現年三十歲，母張氏，二十六歲，家世務農，夫婦均係樸實謹愿之鄉民。據其自稱，曾生一男一女，男妖而女已五歲，是孩係第三胎，爲去年舊歷五月初九日所生，現已十四個足月。誕生時並無其他異狀，五官四肢，亦與常人相同，且體格肥碩，神采奕奕，所奇者，皮膚黝黑，兩目炯炯有光，全體毛髮　然如刺蝟，燦然作金黄色，面部之毛，長至數寸，如柳絲下垂，柔軟無比，幾掩面目，鼻孔與唇中相連處，毛尤濃厚，耳孔中所生之毛更長，茸茸然如一撮毛團，繞至兩頰，尻骨處毛多且密，已漸成一尾巴之形矣。此僅就其外表形態而言，至其特殊異狀，則非親自參觀，不得盡其詭異恢奇之象，而　天地間生物之奇。予（匡君自稱）初見是孩，以爲用人工所造，及撫摩其面，始知確係天然，因其毛茁面頰，鬈曲有光，酷肯獅子，姑假定其名曰「獅形小毛人」，似較報載「長毛怪小孩」，較爲確切，並允留諸蓬萊花園，公開展覽，藉供各界人士之賞鑒與研究。渠之父母亦在側維護，可供詳詢，惟鄕愚無知，對於攝影，認爲不祥，故屢次擬與拍照，以留紀念，均遭拒絕，且有如果欲攝影，須保其三年內無災無晦，不生疾病等語，內地風氣閉塞於此可見一斑。希望生理學家與優生學家，親往察看，窮理格物，能將個中關係，公開發表，俾奇而不離於正，方恩那個解除人疑，不負予收留是孩之善旨云云。</p>
<h3>籠軍歐洲的黑影</h3>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>（不列章）作者與譯者的會見</p>
<p>我順便問　　北平之後，是否就歇在伊的令妹唐賓潮夫人！—容　公主—家中。不料這句話竟勾起了伊的牢騷，伊乎很憤懑地說道：</p>
<p>齡嗎？我　兩個人是不對的！我可說從不曾和伊通過信，　住到伊家裏去！」</p>
<p>可把我怔住了，同胞姊照理該是何等的親熱，再加這位老姊姊去國已有如許之久，這次回來，手足重逢，應該是多麽的歡說啊？却不料竟有這種古怪的情形，我瞧伊說話時的神氣，便可　推想刦伊這次到北平以後，决不會和伊妹妹相兌的，我原是一個彼熱誠的朋友，忍不住便說了許多話來勸解，還說伊妹妹是怎樣的想伊，如其伊不反對的話，我願意代爲拍一電報去請容齡公主到站迎接伊。</p>
<p>「我是不要伊迎接的！」年紀大一些的人脾氣未免流於固執。</p>
<p>其實伊在「御香縹緲」中，屢次提及“MySister”“Mysister”，內心上一定也很渴念着這個妹婊，是因爲當初也許有過什麽誤會，所以一時不願和軟下事。，但在我這個沒有哥哥，沒有弟弟的人聽了，眞是非常的難過。</p>
<p>大凡人們的談話，一談到埠歡的事件，便很難再談下去了；而且看伊的神氣，知道我對於唐夫人有相當的好感，便很疑我是站在唐夫人一面的人，於是我也袛能强笑不言了。</p>
<p>因爲伊也是一個賣文爲生的人，我們便掉轉談鋒，另外談了不少關於生意經上話，，伊聽我說每千牢普通祗賣四元，五元或六元，便笑着說那是祇能買菓醬吃了，伊在美國　文的價値是寫完一部書後，跟那書店那板一頁一頁算的，至少可以髙出我們四五倍。</p>
<p>月台上的脚夫在髙喊着「送客的下車」了。我就請伊在我的卡片後面簽了一個名，可惜伊依舊簽了英文，待我想請伊用中文已不及了。這個我想不要緊，過兩三星期伊回來時，儘可伊重簽的；我所最掛念的是不知道伊到了北平，能不能回心轉意，再和伊的妹妹和好起來（完）</p>

<h3>母親</h3>
<p>— 吳雅非</p>
<p>母親每夜總是不停的咳着，而每次是咳得那麼吃力的，彷彿一口氣都接不上來的樣子；我聽了實在很難受。但經我好多次的向伊徵求同意，要想請個醫生給伊服幾劑藥，然而終究拗不過伊的堅强意旨。伊時常這樣對我們說：</p>
<p>「我好好的吃得下飯，撒得出屎，又沒有生病，看付麽醫生呢？」但伊始終也沒有吃滿過兩碗飯，有時做事吃力了些，甚至一餐不吃，一天不吃也是常有的事；可是伊事情却不肯放鬆，還是要起來幹的。</p>
<p>「母親，你天犬巡樣咳嗽是很傷身體的呀！你爲什麼不要請醫生呢？」這是我遭拒絕後向伊的再訴，可是伊那固定的意識，從沒有給我這誠摯的熱情的請求動搖過一次。</p>
<p>「咳嗽是老病了，看也不見得會有效的，這病還是我生你的時候，沒有人服侍，所以自己到河裏去洗尿布而進了一些冷，到如今差不多已經幾十年了；咳嗽有什麽要……」母親總這椽幽幽地解釋伊不願服藥的原因，其買伊不過要替我們省些錢罷了。</p>
<p>我也曾有過幾次要買些補品給伊吃，但也被伊的倔强固執所拒絕了。</p>
<p>母親早年就守了了　，家裏沒有恒產，祗有三椽勢將傾圯的黃石破屋；沒有田，沒有地，只有幾塊荒蕪的山。而且在父親去世的時候，還遺卜了一千多元的債務，光是利一項，每年就要一三百元。</p>
<p>債要還，利息要償，我和弟弟及伊自己要生活，這時弟弟纔四歲，我也不過九歲；然而伊却不願讓我們去做拾荒的孩子，所以不久就把我們兄弟倆送人了一隻鄉館裏去讀書。這一筆敎育費到那裏去我找呢？伊不計較嗎？伊有的是一個堅强的意志，和一股奮鬥的精神，因些一此也不灰心，一次也不屈服，去熬着痛苦掐扎。伊不需要親戚的帮助，更不願向族人去乞援。伊只曉得刻苦自勵地去做，拿做得來的錢去還債，給我們生活，給我們受敎育；不怨慣，不悲哀，伊以爲前途是充滿了光明的，—只希望兩個孩子大了，一切都不怕，一切都可以解决，祗要我們兄弟倆爭氣上進的話。</p>
<p>現在雖然冷嘲，熱諷，殘酷，悲憤，包圍了伊的週遭；而伊仍舊很樂觀；因爲我們兄弟倆就是伊唯一的安慰者。伊時常用勉勵的口吻對我們說：</p>
<p>「孩子，快用功讀書，媽爲你們這般地含辛如苦，無非是要希望你們巷死去的祖母和父親爭一口氣。人家有吃有穿，我們都不要眼熱，祗要你們大了一切都有；」伊說到這裏，眼角巳經有些潤濕了，但還興奮的設下去；「因爲你祖母也是二十二歲守寡的，那時只傳得你父親一個，現在你父親又這末早就丢你們兩個孩子去世了，這條擔子却壓在我身上……」掙托</p>
<p>等到我們到了十四歲的時光，伊又要替我們東託西求的找生意；我的身體從小就很孱弱的，所以要找比較省力些的事情，弟弟很蠻，做工人也不成問題的。沒有多少時候，事情都有了，於是伊又忙着給我們置辦舖蓋行李，及籌措盤費等，真是煞費苦心。</p>
<p>當我們學業滿帥後，伊因爲看到　椽破屋不可住而且很危險了，所以又想法給我們蓋了五間新屋，伊想有了五間屋，我們兄弟兩個也够住了。但新屋剛才完工，伊又爲了抱孫心切的缘故，接着便和我完了房。從此，我們又虧了二千多元的債務，並且加了近年的農村破產，故使債台只有築高上去；於是伊又不得不來操勞刻苦的帮助我們了。因爲這樣，伊所以到了這末大的年紀還要來餐風宿露的奔波着，着！</p>
<p>可是我們呢？說來也慚愧！不能不能替伊老人家爭口氣，而且更增重了伊的失望！憂愁！痛苦！悲哀！唉！這不孝之罪，雖粉身碎骨亦不容赦免的呵！</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第二十回　掙命看嬌孫抱頭落淚荒年憶往事種麥招殃</p>
<p>窮人的生活，是有飯吃人所不能知道的。自然，窮人的病，也不是有飯吃人所能了解。李士廉他看到粵英的祖母暈跌過去，以為是不治之症，這與自己大由關係。窮人是搖錢不擇手段的，他家人必定說是自己把他謀害了，趁了他家沒有人出來，先溜開罷。這一個念頭，算是把他提醒了過來，立刻縮回了身子，就向小西天裏面走。心裏也跟着在那裏不住的想，我是替人家姨太太探親問病來了，現在已經知道了消息，自然是要去報吿一下。不過眞要說實話，一來怕惹着月英哭，他更要回去。二來也怕他見怪，說是人旣在門口暈倒了過去，爲什麽不去救他，倒跑進來了呢？這一個問題，却是讓人不好答復。越想越對，走起路來的步子，也越走越慢。走着快要到前面那一進屋子了，他就突然的把脚步停住，站在屋角落裏只管發呆。後來有一個茶房，由他身邊經過。看到了他站在過路的所在，好像沉思一件雜事情的樣子，便進　咦！李先生你丢了什麽東西嗎？想什麽？（三三三）</p>

<h3>電子吿警器</h3>
<p>— 仲旭</p>
<p>（Electrnic　Alarm）</p>
<p>此器是用幾件簡單的另件所　成，很有趣味的遊戲品。可以用它來防止一區域內有人走近，電鈴就響了，或則警燈就亮了，還可以防止起火，報吿下雨。</p>
<p>它的搜索綫（Searchwire）的接法，可分兩處；接在X點，比較穩定些，並且沒有輻射電波之弊。接在Y點比較靈一敏些。</p>
<p>（一）接在X點先將吸收綫路（Absorbtioncirout）L1C1調準，與振盪綫路LC同一波長，將L移至甚遠，再生綫路卽起振盪，在圖中Ｘ處串接iio-ioMA電流表，此時屏流約爲四千分安培，然後將L1放近L，增加配舍程度，LC原有振盪减低，配合愈緊，振盪愈弱，終至絕滅，此時屏流約爲七千分安培，所以平時不發生振盪，無輻射電波的妨害。若將搜索繞在房之四周，（假設警備一房間的話如有人走近，搜索綫與地面間的電容量卽行增加，吸收綫路內的波長自然增長，吸收力减低，使再生綫路重行振盪，屏流復歸四千分安培；這變化便能使繼電器時開時閉，在繼電器輸出點上，接着電燈或警鈴等，就發出警號來。</p>
<p>（二）接在Y點將再生綫路調準，比吸收綫路波長路短一些，雖兩奢間配合甚緊，但平時仍有振盪發生，俟搜索綫受到影響，再生綫路增加波長，正與吸收綫路吻合，振盪停止，使屏流變化，而使警號發出。</p>
<p>如果拿它來報雨，祇須在窗外置一柱，上放一金屬盤，盤上再放一盤，其問以膠木絕緣，一盤通地，一盤接在Ｘ或Y點，下雨時電容量增加，卽起作用。拿它來防火，用一水眼寒暑表，一端以錫紙包至70of爲北，另一端亦以錫紙自900起至頂端包好，下端通地，上端接Ｘ或Y點，當起火時，溫度增高，水銀柱上升，因此兩錫紙間電容量增加，而發生作用，更可以運用到別處，祇須合法就是了。</p>
<p>應用另件如下。</p>

<h3>電氣風琴</h3>
<p>— 庸言</p>
<p>現在的風　構造雖已精巧，但事實上尙有種種缺點，譬如：鍵盤接下後並不能立卽發聲，音量太小，音色（ToneClolr）種類太少，音量强弱的變動範圍太小，且不能作平滑的控制等等。凡此種種，皆爲久欲解决而不能者。</p>
<p>「電氣風琴」（ElectrieOrgan）則完全引用電氣原理，故鍵盤按下後立卽能發聲，而發音之準確，音色之優美完全，更非普通風琴可及；且又利用成音週率放大器，故聲浪可任意放大至各種程度，而同時有極平滑的音量控制也。</p>
<p>此種電器風琴的發音原理，請看附圖。圖中之「發音盤」乃連於同期馬達上，作一定速度之旋轉；盤上有突出物若干枚，當此突出物經過其旁之吸鐵石時，磁力綫卽發生變動；此時吸鐵石上之綫圈卽感應而生相等週率之成音週率電壓。此成音週率電壓，經放大後，卽可推動揚聲器而發音也。如此之發音組織，全機中共有九十一組，以發生種種不同之音調。電氣風琴之外形與普通風琴相同，演奏方法亦與普通者相同。</p>
<h3>屏除再生式收音機之缺點</h3>
<p>— 鵑</p>
<p>吾人平常所謂再生式收音機，就是把檢波眞空管屏極電路中的高週率電流的一部分，以再生綫圈爲媒介，回授於柵電路，而使放大度提高者。此種方式如果處理失當，超過再生度數的時候，則有妨害他人之收音，使其音質惡劣，這是盡人皆知的現象，但這一種缺點並不是沒有方法可以屏除的。現在把一種屏除的方法介紹於下：</p>
<p>屏除的方法就是另外利用一個所謂逆再生綫圈和。一個串聯的變量電容器，施以適當的調節，來除却再生力的過度作用。</p>
<p>附圖（一）就是再生式收音機的檢波眞空管，（二）是屏極電路，（三）是陰極電路，在屏極與陰極電路之間設一固定電容器（四），一變量電容器（五），以及普通的再生綫圈（六）。此外和這相並聯，加入勵磁方向相反的逆再生綫團（七）和一雄量電容器。</p>

<h3>讀「「讀中國田制叢考」」後</h3>
<p>— 格蠻</p>
<p>在二十五期的出版界裏，看見曾建屏先生的讀「中國田制叢考」，我仔細讀了一遍，知道曾建屏先生，費了不折不扣的九角大洋，買了一本商務印書館的新劃陳伯瀛先生著的「中國田制叢考」，他讀完了這書，自己喊苦說：「只好痛在心頭」，因爲這書裏面的引證，章法，及結論，是抄竊陳登元先生著的中國土地制度，而且以之作藍本的。</p>
<p>我並沒有讀過這兩本書，但是我却知道一些道兩本書的著者。原來，陳伯瀛先生和陳登元先生，都是我們餘姚的周行鎭人。因爲他們是在南京的大學校裏敎書的，當然，在我們餘姚，巳是「非同小可」的人了，友朋間的談話，每會牽速到這兩位先生的身上去。我好像聽見過，陳伯瀛先生是在南京的大學校裏敎書的，著有關於中國土地問題的書；陳登元先生也是在南京的大學校裏敎書的，也著有關於中國土地問題的書。當時，我就有些猜想，中國人的名字是很多的，也許陳伯瀛先生知陳登元先生是「二而一」的罷？如今，我看了會先生這文，我便向朋友去問，知道了我底猜測不錯。</p>
<p>於是，我覺得當今的著作家和出版家，都只是以圖和爲目的，而忽略了推進文化的使命，據曾先生文中所述：「陳登元的著作，是民國二十一年出版的，而陳伯瀛的著作，却是今年才出世……達者意見，或有相同之處，然而也不能連那引據及結論都完全相同的。而且不止一章相同，其他各節，也多相同」。這樣看來，陳登元先生自二十一年以來，並沒有新的意見和心得，可以貢獻；只是換了一個頭面，改了一些內容又出了一本書；而序裏却說：「田制叢考者，不佞二三年來治史之結果也」。這樣，甲制叢考出版的月的是什麼，是彰彰明甚的。</p>
<p>祈求著作家和出版家，看看中國落後的文化，聽聽：「只好痛在心裏」的呼聲罷。</p>
<h3>論小型報紙</h3>
<p>— 須旅</p>
<p>近頃的出版界有一個可注目的現象：小型報紙的風起雲湧。前前後後興起了的小型報紙，巳不下數十種；而且看情勢，大槪以後還要更興盛，更多下去的吧。</p>
<p>直白地說起來，這似乎是個可喜的現象；中國的新聞紙，比較起西洋來不說西洋，就是日本吧，也總沒有他們多。報紙是民衆敎育最良的武器—其重要固不止於傳達新聞一端；現在能够逐漸多起來，也就是更加强了民衆敎育的力量。自然是極可慶幸的。</p>
<p>但過細說起來，那麼無論是興辦那一種文化事業，其有否效果還不祇是量的問題。單是多决不能說就算好，應當也要有充實的質才行。質和量應該是並重的；譬如說報紙吧，質好而量不多，其力量當然是有限；量多而質不行，那麼不但沒有什麼效力，甚至還會成爲一種毒素，因其量多而更普遍地散佈到民衆的頭腦里去，得到與報紙本義相反的效果。</p>
<p>所以，我們看了小型報紙的蓬勃興起，也不能單單因此而爲出版界慶幸，也應得以嚴肅的眼去看一看這些報紙的實質怎麼樣。</p>
<p>所謂『小報』者，在上海（其實是江蘇全省）的勢力，是誰都知道的。閱者之多，銷路之好，實在不亞於大報。一般識字的民衆，除掉少數學生階級，上層智識階級之外，大家都是寗願看小報而不看大報的。這是爲了什麼緣故呢？考究起來，大概有下列數種原因：</p>
<p>一，因小報便宜。閱讀起來也省時間，</p>
<p>二，因小報內容適合於一般民衆的心理，有趣，新奇，警拔，猥褻，有時也刊載大報所不敢刊載的新聞（因了這點，致以前曾有小報比大報眞實的呼聲），以及足以刺激一般人們的謠言等等。</p>
<p>三，小報一面固然供給了新聞事實（當然是少數），一面也供給了興趣，故人們都樂於一舉兩得。</p>
<p>因了這種原因，小報的銷路比大報好，一般報商自然非常熱狂地發刋，雖也有隨生隨滅，終是日漸地多起來。有些小報，已有了很久的歷史，根深蒂固了。</p>
<p>從上面幾點原因看來，可知示報確實有其引動人們的特質。如果能從新聞事業的根本意義的出發點去辦，則給與民衆的福利，當然是抹敗不掉的。但可惜的是一般所謂小報只偏向於投機營利的目的，而也因一般編輯者大都是舊時代人物的緣故，把內容（即實質）弄得非常壞，包含了很多的毒質。這些壞的實質不但給與民衆以壞傾向，而且還無形地影響到新聞事業的前途。我們只要看那些小報的陳腐，低級趣味的濃厚，無聊甚至無賴，毫沒有敎育的意義，便可了然其給與人們（不但是閱讀者）以如何大的壞影響了。</p>
<p>因此，能創造新的小報來代替那些舊的，是非常地必要，而且也是必然的趨勢。報紙大衆化，報紙便宜化，是創刋小報的根本意義和目標。換句話說，要達到那樣，小報的形式是極可採用的。</p>
<p>但我們必須注意到創刋的動機。這，是非常重要的。要使報紙便宜化，大衆化，當然是創刊小型報紙的動機之一。但我覺得更重要的是：在這新舊小報交替的當口，新的小型報紙應當負着一種革命的責任，要使新的小型報紙能有別於舊的小報，竭力把自己的內容做成新的，時代的，充實的，有敎育的意義的……就利用這種改革的方法，便無形地予舊的小報以打擊，使腐敗的它們被棄於讀者而消滅，失掉其施放毒放的能力。</p>
<p>這是一種破壞的態度，但要建設，破壞是必要的。自然，反過來說，要使這種破壞的態度發生效力，先把自己的實質建設起來也是必要的。</p>
<p>現在我們看一看目前新起的小型報紙，其動機如何，其實質又是如何呢。</p>
<p>報紙大衆化的口號是喊出來了。有些還『以日銷百萬爲目的』。這，當然是對的，爲要使報紙更多地給民衆看，（雖然體己點說起來也是使自己更多得到辦報的代價），原是辦報最初的意義，但據我看起來，能够取我上述那種破壞的勁機和並且把它作爲目的之一的，却是沒有。</p>
<p>這從多數新刋的小型報紙的內容上可以看出。自然，有些也有了改革—譬如把文字改爲白話，把乏味的新聞飾以趣味的文辭等，但只是表面的形式的改革居多，實質改革還是少。大家還只是一味低級趣味化。老實說，低級趣味化是一切刊物的致命傷，即使能使銷路好，却往往會失掉了根本的意義。把內容稍稍傾向趣味，以增加淺薄的民衆的閱讀興趣，原也是很好的一種手段；但過低級了，則仍舊如舊的小報一樣，反會施毒汁於民衆的。其次，各報也還是如舊小報一樣，內容採取的範圍太偏狹；捧角話妓，是舊小報的最惡劣的傾向；而新起的也大都還彈着這種老調；抉發個人的陰私，造謠中傷，也是舊小報最惡劣的傾向，而新起的也還有。有些則格外注意於替一些名人文人之類的私事做報道，把重要的世界，國家，社會的報道都放棄了，（在這一點上我覺得時代日報有推薦的必要）這樣的偏狹，我覺得實在不能使人覺得親起的和舊的有若何分別。既無分別，那麼上述破壞的力量是一點也沒有了，更無論乎要有建設。結果，恐怕是新的終於還是變成舊的吧。</p>
<p>我希望辦小型報的人們能注意到他們的改革。尤其是在促成『破壞』的那點意義上。</p>
<h3>介紹一本房龍的地理</h3>
<p>— 全甲</p>
<p>傳東華譯　新生命書局出版</p>
<p>照例，地理書是一件不容易寫得好的工作，雖然曾有人用遊記體寫地理，可是也沒有什麼成就，這本書是一本十分瑰奇的書，牠旣不像刻板式的文章使人一瞧就頭漲，又不專講興味而忽略意義，這本書的目的，是要我們知道人類和自然的關係，並不呌我們多記牢山河的名字就算了。</p>
<p>房龍自己說：「我的工作，一切都從智識的和人本主義的觀點出發，我要嘗試指明「人」比世界上任何東西都重要，———比宗敎，繪畫，文學都重要。我要呌人明白「人」是宇宙的中心』！作者房龍擺脫了向來的學者態度，他把學問從專家的「精舍裏」提出來，給牠赤了足，未向自由大路去！傳東華在「關於作者的話，裏面曾說：「這本書是用二十世紀的人本主義的火炬將已埋葬的文化分明燭照起來！」好了，讀者記住這句話，來讀這本瑰奇的書吧！</p>
<p>例如他說到中華民國這一章，特別地提到「黃禍」這一章，他說：</p>
<p>「因爲從前黃河是向南流入黃海的。但到一八五二年，它忽然改道了，可是「洪水」二字在中國的意思就是眞正的「洪水，」自十七世紀之末以來，黃河巳改過十次出口，在別的地方可用防河潰决的堤壩，在黃河揚子江的河流却都用不着。例如一八五二年黃河决潰的堤本來高到五十尺，而好像一張馬糞紙般的穿破了。」</p>
<p>房龍在道短短的一段文章中，不是巳吿訴你中國水患的一個斷片了嗎？他還說到中國最近的形勢。</p>
<p>「到了外面列强們對中國的侵略太明顯的時候，中國人已受到一種敎訓，知道西洋各國要到中國去，並非對於孔子之書最大的興味，却對於煤。鐵。油的興味更多，中國於是開始認識有效法日本趕快從事「西方化」的必要了。</p>
<p>『我不是預言家。我不曉得今後十年十五年中將發生什麼事。但我料想情形不致於大變，因爲中國追趕得太遲了些了。但她若竟趕上前去，那麼求老天可憐我們，因爲，咳，我們那時該得付怎樣一筆帳，怎樣一筆帳呀！」（原文見三十七章）</p>
<p>中國先後就有二本譯本，一本是陳瘦石胡澱葳二先生合譯的，題名「房龍世界地理，」一本是傳東華先生譯的，題名「我們的世界，」我不能批評二者的技藝好壞，不過前者是意譯的，後者是直譯，爲了求讀者諸君的腦海中留一張完善的眞像，我便選了後者這本書了。</p>
<p>希望把這一種每個人不可少的世界智識廣播到大衆層去，我鄭重地指出這本有用的書。一些小常識，</p>
<h3>書店雜景</h3>
<p>— 李衡之</p>
<p>—一些小常識，不是生意經—</p>
<p>（一）開書店</p>
<p>老先生說：「　！開書店，現在才有的事！」這意思，表示老先生看不慣所出的書既非「經史」，又非「子集」的那些新書店，其次，那也是實在的，「開書店」這個「風氣」，確是一九二七年左右才開展起來的。以前不是沒有書店，但不是今日的那種新書店，以前不是沒有人開書店，但「開書店」並沒有成爲智識份子，一種「風氣。</p>
<p>在以前，所謂書店，主要的無非是那些什麼「山房」「書屋」之類，專印舊籍的書店，（在七海還很著名的如校經山房，掃葉山房，有正書局等），自維新運動以後，外國的新學制輸入，中國的「學堂」也稍稍變了質，新的敎科書的印行，有了需要，新的書店隨之產生與發展，但直至五四以後，新文化運動澎湃以起，但所有的「新」書店不過還祇是商務印書館，中華書局，文明書局等幾家而巳。後因商務印書館的發展特別龐大，除了一般講究版本的先生們向北平舊書攤及各地藏書樓去收買「明版」宋版一以外，一般小學生中學生（甚至大學生）心目中，所謂書店，不過就商務印書館而巳。於此，可見「書店」的「實落」。</p>
<p>且不論是文化的進展推動書店的發達，還是書店的發達引起文化的進展，總之，那個時　，在文化圈裏，實在是太　寞了。除了些敎課書，不痛不癢的所謂社會科學書，以及半新不舊的小說（如林譯小說，小說世界所代表的野人記等譯本，也是比類）以外，去翻一下當時所謂大書店如商務，中華，文明等幾家的書目，究有一些什麼對於文化推動有關的東西？</p>
<p>我們得讚美國民革命所引發的出版界之新的動力！二九二五年左右，就以上海來說吧，出版界方面發生了新的刺激！泰東在當時還不見引起大家注意，光華書局成立，創造社出版部的創設，北新書局的南遷，對於上海遂稱爲「出版界中心」的出版界，無　是在靜沼中投下了幾顆有子，接着春潮，南强，　羣，新生命，開明，黎明等　家　着興起，遂造成了盛極一時的「問書店」的風氣，當時一般靑年對於出版界的認一識爲之一變：不但不　商務爲唯一的書店的代表，而且認商務等於是以前的「山　」「書　　　　書店，舊書業，新書店，成爲三種性質不能調和的東西。　—未完—</p>

<h3>嚴重之戒烟問題</h3>
<p>— 任國祥醫師</p>
<p>（一）戒烟過程中之一難題</p>
<p>禁烟禁烟。高呼巳久。最近政府决絕厲行切實有效之禁絕辦法。限期登記。限期戒絕。如有私吸抗違。以極刑相執繩。於是烟民在雷厲風行下。不得不惴慄自危。立志以求戒除烟癮。</p>
<p>吸烟之害。人人皆知。吸者亦苦於烟癮之桎梏。戒除之痛苦。致延遲徘徊。然今後則不容不戒。於是烟民戒烟過程中。如何消彌痛苦之法。頓成爲一嚴重之難題。</p>
<p>夫戒烟之過程中。每引起種種不快之疾患。便戒者瞻前顧後。畏縮不前。戀戀難捨。此項疾患引起之原理。要爲欲戒烟者所不可不知也。</p>
<p>蓋吸烟時。煙毒能刺戟全身之神經系統。使其起暫時之典奮。又刺戟全身淋巴腺系統。使其內分泌作不正規之多均分泌。內分泌爲倒全之要素。故吸後似頓覺爽健百倍。然此種不正規之刺戟性分泌。久後枯竭。决非正道。且形成麻痺性。非吸不可。因是而中毒成癮。</p>
<p>就一般醫師之臨診經騐。見戒者因内分泌缺乏而引起種種病患痛苦。如投以斯丹那氏內分泌製劑「生殖素」。立現內分泌機能正規旺盛。而諸症不藥自除。於以知「生殖素爲解决戒烟時難題之唯一秘　矣。</p>
<p>（按）生殖素各大藥房均售。戒者可認明本品。自行購服之。</p>
<h3>救急常識之二</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>（二）卒中</p>
<p>卒中俗稱中風。與卒倒（皀俗稱　倒）不同。恰處於相反之地位。</p>
<p>卒中者。因腦部血管破裂。其血液壓迫腦髓。或因血管栓塞而腦內血流斷絕所致。本症槪因血管呈硬化。易起破裂所致。有手足麻痺，眩暈，耳鳴，頭痛等前徵。凡患梅毒酗酒。或因內分泌機能失常而致過肥胖者。每易患之。本症甚危。與卒倒異。有生命憂。</p>
<p>延醫前救急法。可將病人衣帶鬆解。令其安臥。頭位略高。使血降少。冷水或冰囊罨貼其額。凡平日服內分泌製劑「生殖素」者。當無是症也。</p>
<h3>遺精借鑑</h3>
<p>— 李炳章來稿</p>
<p>僕於靑年時代。誤於淫書之誘。耽於手淫之害。暗室戕喪。旦旦而伐。不知耗失幾許精元。滋可痛也。</p>
<p>十九歲秋。就業滬濱。頓覺精力過衰。乃立志戒除惡習。然卽起遺精之患。初尙有夢而遺。繼且無夢自滑。至其症象。亦日趨嚴重。自數日一次。增爲一月二十餘次。最多之時。有一夕頻頻遺滑者。於是精神大憊。頭暈眼花。耳鳴腰酸。失眠健忘諸症。紛起雜乘。後投任國祥醫師診所求治。蒙囑服希米脫氏固情片。以治遺精。遺精旣愈。復服生殖素以資調補。前後不越兩月。已諸症消失。健康逾恒。回憶治療經過。大可作同病者之借鑑。因亟錄之以投本刋</p>
<h3>胃病宜速治</h3>
<p>— 周笑涵醫師</p>
<p>胃爲人身吸收營養之總機關。如其機能發達。則人體健全。如蒙有病患。卽不能吸收充分之營養料。於是人體遂因營養失調而引起種種變症。</p>
<p>食慾不振與便秘口臭。均因胃臟異動而起。如速服胃痛靈。卽可食慾亢進。且免除一切胃腸疾患。如延不服藥。則噎酸，腹痛，反胃，以及消化不良，胃脘疼痛等症繼起。痛苦加甚。就吾人臨診經騐。凡患胃脘一切疾患。如投以「胃痛靈」。無不霍然而愈。用治久遠胃病。尤具特效。</p>
<h3>希米脫氏固精片之卓效</h3>
<p>— 唐厚齋來稿</p>
<p>冶愈一多年遺精患者之報告</p>
<p>鄙人發育過早。知人事亦早。十四歲卽犯手淫。半由於中淫書之遺毒。半由於受劣友之引誘。旦旦而伐。新喪殊甚。十六歲起。卽患這精。自此身體失健。日漸孱弱。痛戒手淫。但遺精如故。十八歲。因母命完姻。而是年起。遺精亦自數日一次變爲一月二十餘次。心中恐慌。亂服藥丸。非未不效。反增其勢。去年因見友人遺精服希米脫氏固精片治愈。遂亦購服之。兩盒未完。遺精已不多見。續服兩盒。遺精絕跡。多年舊患。一旦拔除。深爲愉快。現正在遵醫生之囑。服生殖素調補。身軀日見健壯。精神愈覺充實。噫。若希米脫氏固精片者。洵遺精患者之莫大救星也。</p>
<p>（按）遺精愈後。服生殖素培補最效。</p>
<h3>疾病問答</h3>
<p>（來稿須詳地址並附覆信郵費）</p>
<p>毫無發育</p>
<p>林雙喜問：鄙人結婚過早。身體毫無發育。各部仍如童子。未知有何妙藥。</p>
<p>（答）欲使身體各部得充分之發育。當服斯丹那氏「生殖素一。立奏奇效。</p>
<p>見食僧厭</p>

<h3>神經衰弱之痛苦</h3>
<p>— 任國祥醫師</p>
<p>人體生理。有數大系統。一曰血液循環系統。所以灌輸血液於全身各部者也。二曰淋巴系統。所以分泌及吸收血液中之營養要素。以分佈於全身各部者也。三日神經系統。所以支配意志命令於全身各部。使起種種之活動作用者也。此外若骨骼·肌肉·筋絡。分佈於全體。皆各自成其系統。苟某一系統有病患。卽全身蒙其影響。如血液系統之貧血。淋巴系統之內分泌缺乏及營養不良。神經系統之衰弱皆是也。而以患神經系統者。所引起之病患最多。痛苦亦最一甚。如健忘。失眠。疲勞。瘦弱。早老。不育。腰酸。背疼等等。皆因神經衰弱而起。吾人臨床經騐。對於上列之病患。以斯丹那氏生殖素投之。恒獲最滿意之效果。蓋生殖素之配製。含有營養神經之內分泌，胚腺腺（卽賜保命）。維他命等生活要素。故統治上述各症。有藥到病除之效也。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>英法兩國間的討價還價</h3>
<p>— 李敏</p>
<p>自從意大利的黑衣宰相墨索里尼要立志征服遠在東菲的阿此西尼亞黑人王　，爲這「野蠻」民族盡義務的—並且自願付出極大的代價—代爲灌入歐洲的白人「友明」，這事件發動以來，意國對「野蠻」民族的征服事件，就立刻變作英意兩大國對殖民地爭奪的糾紛。</p>
<p>英國對於菲洲殖民地及在地中海上的利益，就其本身利害關係設，是必須盡「九牛二虎」之力來維持的；然而德國却又是它在歐洲大陸上唯一的與國。問題的困難，就在這一點。還是和法國聯絡，共同進攻意國呢？還是寗願捨棄了和法國聯絡，而仍繼續和德國聯絡，共同進行其對比意大利更大的蘇俄的進攻的準備呢？英國目前的外交，在這一點上，着實是委决不下。我們很可以看到它的苦心所在。</p>
<p>法國也算狡獪。在對德問題上，它是一向想取得英國的聯絡，而共同壓迫德國的，但英國給它的回答，却是一個相反，反是聯絡着德國去壓迫法國。這情形，使法國不能不於最近二年中，轉換從前態度，而去和立塲完全相反的蘇俄聯絡起來。這次意國遠征阿國事件發生，法國滿想在這一事件上，能轉換英國從前對法國的態度，以共同制裁意國，交換英國的帮助法國制裁德國。所以當英國要求法國共同制裁意國的表示達到法國時，法國就提出一個先决條件，說：假使德國侵奧時，英國也是否帮助法國制裁德國呢？英國的回答很狡獪，說且到那時看情形再說，目前不能預定（見二十八日報紙電訊）。法國自然感到失望。是以今後的法國外交方針，是助英抑是助意，到是一個很有趣的問題。</p>
<p>英法間的外交，目前正在這樣討價還價情形中。而一方，我們却又從報上得到了德國積極布置進攻俄國的消息。東方也在加速準備。也許在第二次世界大屠殺展幕之時，倒是雄踞北歐的蘇俄，會變成了各個列强砲下的放大的阿比西尼亞。</p>
<h3>心之語</h3>
<p>— 西蒙</p>
<p>在凄冷的月華照着椰枝的時候，在墓頂的小草零落的時候，在纏綿的烟雨蒙着山海的時候，正是我對着秋風爲慘痛的回憶而隕淚的時侯。有了回憶，我的思緒巳經迷亂，我不能明白數淸是昨年的光景，還是前年的光景，總是很久很遙遠的了。可是我依舊覺得鮮明如在目前一樣，這就使得漸漸釀成一個不可治的心臟衰弱病症。琳子，我是不惜用自己的手來割斷自己的咽喉，完結這勞碌的生命，好讓我跟你一同去躺在地窟里的。只是爲着你最後幾句話的牽引，遂令我時時抱着不能有負於你的念心，這樣，我無言地拖起一副支離的身子，三年的時間的悾惚過去了。如早秋神又</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>披着錦　的霞彩散佈在山海之上，想着你的　地該又有一度的荒蕪，已無牧童的歌音吧，則你也還是寂寞的。而我尙滯留異方，祇能於釋迦牟尼的古敎堂敲着黃昏的鐘聲的時候，依稀望着海頭的月亮作一番心的野祭。琳子，你如果有知覺，你當能够設想這其間我是如何地在過着比夢魔更驚悸的日子，從那一天，我的靈魂巳同時被什麼鬼魅帶走，可是我却至今不相信你會是走得那麼安閒，那麼無拖累，彷彿世上眞沒一樣東西値得你的　留。琳子，决不，我知道你準是懷着永生的遺恨一同地藏到地下去。因此，我曉得你這被弔亡的人心中之語一定較誰都多，但是你終於未曾留下一句話，便默默地去了。</p>
<p>我常常夢幻着在遠處的原野上，微牀，心貫穿着尖利的銀箭，又彷彿看見高塔上的謨罕默德像一面牆堵的陰影推向面前來，感到一陣顚震，於是我醒過來了。原來還是伏着案上，凄黃的燈花撫摸着我臟肺綳緊着，又發着虛。我突然發現襟際間染了一片殷紅的血跡，濕潤潤地尙未乾透。我是一點懼怕也沒有，倒深深奇怪這病弱的殘軀還有這麼多的血量，我不禁惋惜着，我的血不應該白白地在此時流掉，我當存蓄下來，以等有日去到你墓前盡情傾灑，作爲唯」的祭禮啊！</p>
<p>當我入獄的消息傳到你那邊，你竟撇棄一切的阻撓和困難，從遠的島國受了三日夜的海程的勞頓來到這海島，另後用了許多方法才能見面。我還明晰地記住那天你穿着素色的淡裝，越發見出你好像春風裏一朵不勝嬌媚的白芙蓉。而完全出乎意料之外的是；你笑瞇瞇地望着我，毫沒愁容與悲哀，爲了那地方不是可以多說話，所以你祇短短說：「你等着吧，太陽總是不離開你的」的一句話，雖然是短短一句話，但你的整個爲我的靈魂，和那激情的聲調已經感動得幾乎流淚，假如允許我痛哭一塲的話，那時我會放聲哭出來的。我的深暗的古井一般的心，宛如投下一顆石塊，頓時冷起無數的波瀾來。是啊，琳子，你就是太陽，我心頭上永遠明亮的太陽，沒有你照耀着，怕我早便不存在於世間了。</p>
<p>我的罪名是要用許多金子才能注銷的。因此虧得你賣盡一身的金飾；不够還要到各處破臉凑集。我終於回到太陽光下的世界，可是却同時决去心頭的太陽，你反而脫離了太陽光下的世界，而走進別一個黑暗的世界去了。琳子，世事眞是如此的蒼茫麼？叫我一腔無吿的怨恨，哀傷憑誰來訴說。</p>
<p>秋已深了，南方的紅芙將從艷色到黃色，而憔悴了。琳子，你熱情的一十十個靑春的生命，彷彿紅芙一樣易謝易榮，莫非你正是那花妖的化身？我掮着兩肩沈重的罪孽與人情的擔子，帶着疲憊的呼吸，太息着，在風雨裏，陰黑黑，在荒漠的不見邊際的旅途上蹣跚，我唯有看見烏雲的伸展，不曾迎尤晨光的照射。無眼淚，無希冀，但是琳子，你的不滅的幽魂也在飄零着麼，爲什麼在夢裏也追縱不到呢？</p>
<h3>古城的憶念</h3>
<p>— 羅之華</p>
<p>駱駝成日里搖著「可吟」……</p>
<p>調著秋風里哀怨的悲歌，</p>
<p>黃色的沙子，黃色的落葉，</p>
<p>襯著孤獨人心里的寂寞。</p>
<p>雖然我來到××巳經三年了，但深刻的記憶裏總留着一個古城的影子！有著歷史上文化價値的建築，和著茫茫的沙漠，在這古城——開封，恰　一座死寂的幕一般，沒有一點見注氣，都市氣：但是，育時我很想念道地方，上　的詩句是三年前的夏天懷念起開封的友人時才寫的。——我很愛那裏，愛那裏人們生活的扑素，和忠誠。</p>
<p>提起關封來，就想到北平。</p>
<p>在未到北平之先，我曾經夢想著北平的情形，想像，大半都是誇張的太厲害的，於是我想著那兒一定是：駱駝搖著啞了的銅鈴，在沙漠裏走，其靜穆有如一個流浪者。同時，在荒凉的街道上，只有老僧侶的木魚聲從寺院飄出來，迴蕩著。這以外，全是寂寞，死了的寂寞。</p>
<p>但是，在一個秋天，我走出「前門車站」的時候，一切都不是想像中一樣。這些想像的來原，大半和在開封居住過有關。</p>
<p>開封，的確是個古城。</p>
<p>相國寺，禹王台，鐵塔，龍亭，都保持著古味。</p>
<p>但是，也漸漸地被近代的文明侵入了。</p>
<p>比方，相國寺，他的內容和北平的天橋，上海的城隍廟差不多。是小市民的娛樂塲所。在先，許多種種在寺殿裏存着，北伐以後，全變成一般人的俱樂部。每天也不知道多少人在這裏遊戲，也不知道多少人快樂，北伐把相國寺復活了。</p>
<p>龍亭呢，那是宋朝的故宮。假如果在一個黃昏，走到這宮殿的高處四處瞭望，心頭不禁想起帝王的高貴，那時他可以看着這茫茫的大地，和遠處的無邊的霧。他所以要把宮殿修得這樣高，也是由於向民衆示威吧。一層層的台階，代表了一層層的官級，他就坐在台階盡頭的堂皇的殿上，使得萬衆敬仰；土著的百姓說，「皇帝坐在金鸞殿上，知州才能在午朝門那兒朝見呀！——頭也不敢抬」！</p>
<p>北伐以後，也公開了。破除去許多空想。</p>
<p>鐵塔，更是一個偉大的建築。全是玻璃瓦築的，高高的十三級，外邊被太陰晒着，反出綠色的，紫色的，紅色的光。在最高一層可以看到黃河的玉帶似的長身。</p>
<p>禹王台，雖然已經荒蕪，還保有他天然的美姿。</p>
<p>我的童年就全完消逝在這古城裏了。而這古城就把我的性格養成了那樣的憂鬱，每次想到家鄉，先記往水災的苦狀，又想到這城池。</p>
<h3>夜渡</h3>
<p>— 沈塢</p>
<p>越過了牛頭嶺時，天漸漸沉黑了。望望背后那一重一疊的山影，和那一叢一簇的野樹，草莽和松林，周圍是一片陰深，荒凉的景象，就縱然有個葫蘆那樣大的膽子，也會禁不住的在心中戰慄起來；何况這兒的綠林的兇狠，比之裙帶山那邊的大寨還要厲害呢。</p>
<p>八條腿兒在婉蜓的山路上，越發緊密地移動着，箬鞋和泥沙礦刷得「沙索」「沙索」地響。大家好像埋怨着天黑得太快：「媽兒的，還沒到黑水渡頭哩。」然而脚步却不論怎麼樣也快不少許多，心里越焦急，也就越走得不起勁，這不知可是纏上了什麼鬼？往日太陽還不曾下山就渡過黑水了，今兒却只過了牛頭嶺，豈不是要三史後才到家？……</p>
<p>轉過了一業野荊圍抱着的曲徑，把擔子從左肩換到右屑來，這時猛的覺得肩膊好像有點疼，反手把它模撫一下，又硬尤頭皮往　走去。走了幾乎一個整天，漸漸才感覺到擔子的確比往日的重得多，怪不得今天一早老宋就嚷着出貨多了起來，自己却迷迷糊糊地擦尤惺忪的睡眼，一聲不響，於是又上了這一次大當。……</p>
<p>待　到那一片黑沉沉的河水時，月亮已經從山　里探出頭來了。河邊又是一叢密密的亂草，有些像是靑蛙，却又不是靑蛙，在草叢中「閣啦」「閣啦—」地叫。</p>
<p>看看渡頭那邊好像沒有燈光，二林很有些焦燥，就「喂！野雜種！」大聲的駡着那邊的船夫。這一罵，却給竹老頭把他喝住了；</p>
<p>「蠢猪，你打仗把我們賣了麼？這麼大聲喚！……好走近碼頭去看看哪：」</p>
<p>大家也有些埋怨二林這小鬼頭的冒失。</p>
<p>走近渡頭邊了，船可眞的沒有停泊在這兒，望望對岸也沒有它的影踪，月亮是朦隴的，只照着灘流似的黑水的湍動。河水聲淙淙地與山間的蟲聲相慶，非常淸晰和悅耳。</p>
<p>我們把擔子放下了，心頭眞個焦急了起來。大家相覷地互相觀望。二林的眼睛朝着竹老頭旺着，好像是報復的樣子；</p>
<p>「這狗入的野雜種，開到那里去了？猪—」雖則仍是燥憤的駡，聲音可低了許多，只有這兒的幾個人才聽得見。</p>
<p>夜是靜默而且渺茫的。在驚惴和焦急之中，還是老宋比較能够保持着鎭靜。他把手電筒徇河面周圍照了照，一道白色的光接過了河邊的亂草。果然，在一塊黑色的大岩石下，照見那隻小渡船了。大家這時才破顏地挑起了擔子朝着石壁那邊去，亂草被竄動得索索地響。</p>
<p>「猪玀，你打仗不載我們的貨了嗎？猪子養的，還瞌什格哪？……」</p>
<p>老朱用手電筒朝那船夫的臉上照着，他才慢慢的揉着眼睛，燃起那盞油燈來。幾個人述貨物都拋進船艙裏去，二林獨自個兒倒在船板上打瞌。——</p>
<p>船在急湍的黑水中搖到河的中間了，船身漸漸有點動蕩地搖擺着。</p>
<p>「喂，豬兒哪，好用點心把舵啦，不要讓你老祖宗送葬了！」</p>
<p>大家用着驚　的心來看着滾滾的可水，月亮慢慢就爬上山預了。</p>

<h3>風</h3>
<p>— 熊子蕾</p>
<p>飄零的季節，飄零的九月，飄零的九月之夜，我常走在靜的湖邊，看那些水面浮起的慘淡的燈光，心里是帶着霧的在想。</p>
<p>閃着光的星子，和着幽凈的月亮，什麽都浸透在陰悒里。遠從北國吹來的風，傳來葉落的一個低語，報道秋來了！</p>
<p>我向着風吹來的那方凝視了很多時候；然而，我沒有找到些什麽；我只有閉上眼睛，靜聽着風的彈奏。</p>
<p>這沒有節韻的音樂，使我想起了許多舊日，使我描畫了許多舊日的歡樂和悲哀。摧人憔悴的風啊！</p>
<p>我看着自己印在地面上的影子，是夠我迷惘了的；然而，當着風吹來時，連影子也跟着搖盤了！我是進入了另一個老年的世界嗎？</p>
<p>呵，老了上什麽都在風的彈奏中老了！</p>
<p>我踏着凄凉的步子歸去。</p>

<p>軟腳先生更正一信，（陳競芳的確下嫁否，也不必這樣的來辯論，好在你先生一定喝過喜酒的。也許是，陳小姐的非親即眷哩！）時事新報播音機也是腳兄的大作，讀後不勝欽佩之至，這是的確的，你的大作有重覆刊登的價値和必要，（頂好請社會日報播音圈裏像銀雨所說的也去連一連）。有一段在新夜報刊登的：「張如小名彩弟」，署名是「軟腳」，當然也是腳兄所寫的大兒了，不過我歇星圖畫報上看見也是照樣這幾個字：「張如小名彩弟」，不知可也是你腳兄所寫，或者還是該報抄襲你的大作？</p>
<p>江曼莉一日駕臨利利電台，在玫瑰團客串了拿手的傑作「永別了弟弟」，喉音好像較前稍差，大約上次去各地表演時意外工作過勞所致！</p>
<p>王眞在玫瑰時說玫瑰的好，出玫瑰就說玫瑰的怎樣，進了夜鶯說夜鶯的好，現在出了夜鶯又說夜鶯的那樣；王眞君眞還是個小弟弟，所謂有糖即甜，沒糖就苦！</p>

<h3>Italy Announces War Against Abyssinia: Northern Army Advances on All Fronts: White and Black Troops Invade 12 Miles into Abyssinian Territory: Heavy Bombardment Threatens Aduwa</h3>
<p>(Rome) The Foreign Office here officially announced that the Italian East African High Commissioner today declared that Eritrea and Italian Somaliland are in a state of war. This is the result of several contacts between Italian and Abyssinian forces on both sides. Although this announcement cannot be immediately regarded as a declaration of war, it is sufficient to indicate that the Italian government has officially acknowledged the commencement of military action, similar to the Japanese army's undeclared war of aggression against Manchuria in 1931. (3rd National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) General Taibono, the Italian High Commissioner in East Africa, has formally announced the commencement of war against Abyssinia. The proclamation states that Italian troops in Eritrea, bordering northern Abyssinia, have crossed the Mareb River to ensure security. It further accuses the Abyssinian government of violating all treaties, stating that the steps taken by the Italian army are for the sake of peace, and advises the public to remain calm and not cause disturbances. Rome has also officially acknowledged the heavy aerial bombardment of Aduwa. It is reported that the air force squadron led by Mussolini's son-in-law, Ciano, was fired upon by Abyssinian soldiers during a reconnaissance flight. The squadron advanced to Aduwa, where artillery batteries opened fire. Italian aircraft then bombed the artillery positions. Despite the heavy firing from the batteries, no Italian aircraft were hit. The Italian authorities dismiss the claim that a Red Cross hospital was hit by a bomb as completely unfounded. (4th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) It has been reliably learned that Italian forces in East Africa will continue to advance without a declaration of war, citing Abyssinia's "aggressive attitude" as forcing them to take pre-emptive action to secure Eritrea and Somaliland. It is also reported that Mussolini now considers the matter settled and believes he can "rest easy," confident that Britain and France will allow the Italian army to complete its East African plan without destroying Italian power and disrupting European peace. (3rd National Telegram)</p>
<p>Eritrean Italian Army Front Lines: Black Askaris and white Italian troops have charged into Abyssinian territory together. These black soldiers are like walking arsenals, carrying machine guns, short guns, pistols, and broadswords. As they entered Abyssinian territory, they chanted in their native language, "We swear to cut off the Abyssinian Emperor's mustache and make it into a small brush to polish Mussolini's boots!" Initial reports of the offensive indicate that the campaign is progressing smoothly and in accordance with the original plan. (2nd National Telegram)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital: Italian and Abyssinian forces clashed today on the Aduwa line and are still engaged in fierce fighting. Intense aerial bombardment by the Italian air force has not shaken the Abyssinian army's morale. Italian infantry, aided by machine gun units and tanks, are attacking Meberia and Aksum and have already occupied Lama Mountain. Today's Italian military headquarters report states that Italian troops have advanced ten English miles into Abyssinian territory, reaching their first day's objective. (4th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Asmara: According to frontline news today, Italian troops have penetrated twelve miles into Abyssinian territory, occupying Dali Baitaker, which is 6,600 feet above sea level and controls the Aduwa basin twelve miles away. After the Italian army's heavy aerial bombardment of Aduwa, various units crossed the swift Mareb River at dawn yesterday in impressive array. The vanguard was led by the Eritrean cavalry in white uniforms. As the horses crossed the bridge, their equipment clattered. They were followed by infantry in khaki uniforms, light and fast tanks loaded with machine guns, with a thundering sound, and then field artillery and heavy transport vehicles. Aircraft soared in the sky to scout and prevent enemy ambushes. The Abyssinian army was ordered not to engage in heavy fighting and offered no resistance. The road taken by the Italian army was newly built but only suitable for motor vehicles. Before the evening departure, Asmara and Norga Descartes Sevo were decorated with lanterns and streamers and extremely excited. Residents walked along the streets, singing patriotic songs. (4th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital: It is reported that Italian and Abyssinian forces fought fiercely in the northern mountainous pass of Tigray, with Italian air support. The Abyssinian authorities claim that the Italian forces have been defeated. At the same time, Italian troops are still advancing in the northeastern corner of Abyssinia, near the swampy plains of Mount Mussa Ali, encountering no resistance. The Abyssinian army in that area is now hiding in the Walo Valley, waiting to engage the enemy. It is reported that forty Italian aircraft participated in the bombardment of Aduwa today, and anti-aircraft guns have been deployed at all key locations. The Abyssinian capital is filled with the atmosphere of war, and foreign businesses are quite alarmed, but the Abyssinian people remain very calm. Seven thousand prisoners have now been released and sent to the front lines. There are now five thousand mounted and foot police in the capital, providing protection. It is reported that the staff of the Italian embassy may be detained in the Abyssinian capital as hostages. (3rd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital: Italian forces advancing from the north, east, and south towards Mattawa, after heavy aerial bombardment of the border strongholds of Aduwa and Adigrat, forced the Abyssinian outposts to retreat today. There have been no confirmed reports of casualties so far, but it is learned here that a total of 1,700 people have died, approximately one-third of the residents of Appohwa. Women, children, and soldiers alike have perished under the bombs. Foreign envoys here have been shocked by this inhumane act. The Abyssinian government is now taking various measures to protect the capital. Dozens of foreigners, fearing night air raids, have fled the city. General Gabata is leading 50,000 Abyssinian troops to Mount Mussa Ali, and a telegram from that area reports fierce fighting, indicating that the army has made contact with enemy forces. The official Abyssinian report lists the Italian army's lines of attack as follows: (1) Advancing from Asmara to take Aduwa; (2) Invading Agame Province; (3) Advancing from Mount Mussa Ali; (4) Advancing from Walwal. There are now skirmishes along the Somaliland border, and the local chieftain is preparing to lead 25,000 daredevil cavalrymen to halt the advance of Italian tanks and armored vehicles. Since the mobilization order was issued here yesterday, soldiers have crowded the streets. Although lacking knowledge of modern warfare, they are all prepared to bravely face the enemy. The mobilization order was sent by falcon to border regions across the country. (4th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) Today's official statement claims that the war in Abyssinia is currently underway. Army divisions, Blackshirt brigades, and Libyan troops crossed the border yesterday, advancing along a 20-kilometer front through treacherous mountainous terrain, encountering no resistance. Residents waved white flags to welcome the Italian army. The population is now in a very difficult situation, and the Italian army has been distributing food. The air force has been conducting reconnaissance south of Aduwa, beyond Magal and the Takaze River, and dropping food and propaganda leaflets. Abyssinian forces in Aduwa and Adigrat have launched heavy rifle and artillery fire, which was countered by two squadrons of Italian bombers. Italian troops have consolidated their newly occupied positions overnight and advanced along the entire Eritrean front at dawn, with high morale. (4th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital: Today, Abyssinian forces near Aduwa shot down an Italian aircraft with anti-aircraft fire. (4th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital: It was learned here tonight that the prominent Abyssinian leader, Mr. Ayilu, is now leading an army of 13,000 men from the west of Aduwa to invade Italian Eritrea. It is reported that his vanguard has occupied an Italian military outpost. (4th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London, May 5) Italian forces have occupied Mount Hill, which controls the Aduwa plain ten miles away. Therefore, the town of Aduwa is expected to fall at any moment. (4th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London, May 5) East African battle reports received here state that the Abyssinian Commander-in-Chief telegraphed the Abyssinian Emperor urgently, requesting reinforcements. If they cannot arrive immediately, Aduwa will not be held. It was also telegraphed that the Abyssinian army suffered a major defeat in the north. (10th, 4th, National News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital: The Abyssinian army suffered losses near Agagne and Adigrat but is determined to defend Aksum to the death. Fierce fighting is underway there. It is generally believed that the Aduwa commander abandoned his position solely due to the Italian air force's bombardment, but it is believed that he will be able to safely retreat the entire army. (4th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Italian Army Frontlines in Eritrea: The nation's East African army advanced into Abyssinia by land and air today. The primary targets are Aduwa and Adigrat in the north. Chalk markings on the tanks and transport vehicles indicate that the final target of the offensive is the Abyssinian capital. Bombers flew over mountains of 11,000 feet high and circled Aduwa without difficulty. It is not yet known whether the people of Abyssinia have received warning of the attack. Tens of thousands of Italian troops continued south today. (3rd National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Italian Ambassador Visits British Foreign Secretary Again: Still Seeking a Diplomatic Solution?</h3>
<p>(London) The Italian Ambassador to Britain, Grandi, visited Foreign Secretary Hoare at the Foreign Office at 3 p.m. It is rumored that Grandi presented the Foreign Secretary with new proposals for resolving the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. Officials believe that any proposals Italy might offer would be unlikely to form the basis for a peaceful solution, but it is seen that Italy is not refusing to seek a final solution based on diplomatic action. (4th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Foreign Office formally announced today that the declaration of a state of war by Italian Somaliland military officers is not equivalent to a declaration of war.</p>
<h3>The Horrors of Italian Aerial Bombardment: A Heartbreaking Sight: Many Soldiers' Wives and Children Died a Tragic Death</h3>
<p>Abyssinian Capital: The scenes during and after yesterday's Italian aerial bombardment of Aduwa were heartbreaking. Many soldiers' wives and children died a tragic death while their husbands were stationed in camps outside the town. Italian aircraft flew low over the town, dropping bombs. It is reported that they were not subjected to anti-aircraft fire, as Aduwa is listed as an undefended town. No news of fighting has yet come from the Ogaden province in southern Abyssinia, bordering Italian Somaliland. However, Governor Iyume of Tigray telegraphed that Italian forces north of Aduwa are currently launching heavy artillery fire. (4th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital: News here today indicates that Abyssinia does not intend to formally declare war. It is also reported that 350,000 Abyssinian infantrymen have gathered near Lake Tsana, some armed with spears. Other small groups of troops scattered across various locations have been ordered to proceed to the Somaliland border. Abyssinian troops have been under strict orders to avoid frontal warfare, but it is claimed that most soldiers are eager to shed blood. Therefore, it is likely that many troops will disregard this order. (3rd National Telegram)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital: Many foreigners here have fled to nearby mountains to avoid early morning air raids by Italian aircraft. The Abyssinian Ministry of War has formally denied Italian victories on the Somaliland front. Meanwhile, the Abyssinian Emperor has released all prisoners in the country so that they may serve on the battlefield. Observers estimate that this measure will add tens of thousands to the fighting force. According to unconfirmed reports received here, a major battle is also occurring in the East Ossa province of French Somaliland. (3rd National Telegram)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital: According to well-informed officials, the Italian envoy received his exit passport this afternoon and is required to lower his flag and return home by Friday. The Italian embassy has withdrawn all its deposits from local banks today. Reliable reports from the capital also confirm that the Italian air force bombed Adigrat this morning, destroying one hundred civilian houses. Fifteen houses were also destroyed in Aduwa. (3rd National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Paris Morning News reported today that Mussolini's son-in-law, Sir Ciano, has bombed and destroyed the palace of Fort Dawar. (4th National Telegram)</p>

<h3>The Pitiful Abyssinians: Never Seen an Airplane Before: Trembling with Fear from the Bombing</h3>
<p>Qalidawa: Italian aircraft are currently dropping bombs along the route from Mount Mussa Ali in the northeast to Dawa Luo territory in Taixi. Most of the people in the Danakil tribes have never seen an airplane before and are trembling with fear. (4th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital: Italian aircraft dropped leaflets in the Tigray region today, advising the population to separate from Abyssinia and choose their own monarch. The leaflets, printed in Tigrinya, bear the slogan "Accept Italian friendship, or you will not escape death." (4th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Abyssinian Emperor Has Not Slept for a Day and Night: Declares He Will Persevere to the End</h3>
<p>Observing Airplanes with Binoculars</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital: Although the Abyssinian Emperor has not slept for a full day and night, he is still full of energy today. He sat in a leather chair by the window of the palace, holding binoculars, watching for enemy aircraft. The Abyssinian Emperor told the Reuters reporter that he expressed his sincere gratitude to the British ruling elders for their efforts towards peace. The Abyssinian Emperor said that he would never forget the noble spirit that Britain showed to Abyssinia. The Abyssinian Emperor also said that the ban on the export of armaments to Abyssinia should be lifted immediately, as Italy is truly the aggressor, having invaded Abyssinian territory from several locations and bombed the towns of Appohwa and Adigrat. The Abyssinians have sought peace for months, but to no avail. Now, they have no choice but to defend their territory and persevere to the end. (3rd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital: At the end of the Abyssinian Emperor's promulgation of the general mobilization order yesterday, one million people across the country will begin to concentrate. Although they are ordered to proceed to the front lines alone, they should still bring their families with them. Prisoners in prisons have been released, and anyone who does not obey the order to enlist will be shot. Abyssinians serving in the Italian embassy have expressed their loyalty to the Emperor. (4th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Terrain of Aduwa</h3>
<p>40,000 to 50,000 Abyssinian Troops Concentrated: Difficult March at 1,000 Feet Above Sea Level</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital: According to information obtained by a Havas News Agency special correspondent, approximately 40,000 to 50,000 Abyssinian troops are concentrated in the area around Aduwa. Therefore, those in charge believe that the Italian army will not occupy the area without firing a shot. The area around Aduwa is the site of the tombs of ancient Abyssinian emperors, which the Abyssinian people regard as sacred ground. If the Italian army invades from this point, the Abyssinian army will inevitably defend it with all its strength. After the Italian army crosses the Mareb River on the Abyssinian border, there are almost no roads to reach Aduwa. The army must use large mountain-climbing vehicles to ascend a height of 1,000 meters, traveling a distance of 60 kilometers. There is no way to obtain drinking water and food along the way. Therefore, the army must carry sufficient supplies, which are carried up the mountain by mountain-climbing vehicles. Each company of soldiers must have multiple mules, each carrying a leather water bottle with a capacity of 50 liters. Each soldier must carry two liters of drinking water with them. The difficulty of the march can be imagined. (3rd Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital: Battles are currently raging on both the northern and southern borders of Abyssinia. The Italian army, relying on the superiority of its weapons, has gained ground on both fronts. The Abyssinian government has formally acknowledged that the troops of Governor Siyum of the Tigray region in the north suffered a major defeat near Aduwa. According to news from Harare, fierce fighting was seen this morning in the Ogaden province in the south, resulting in 2,000 Abyssinian deaths and many injuries. (4th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The European Situation and the Memel Question</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>The prelude to World War II can be said to have already begun. In recent months, diplomats from peace-loving countries in Geneva have been striving for a peaceful resolution to the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. The first gunshot on the East African front has finally awakened them from their illusions. They have currently abandoned hope for peace and are seeking to join forces to confront the current enemy. Britain is requesting maritime assistance from France to counter Italy, and France has also requested Britain to guarantee peace in Central Europe to prevent Germany from moving south. Other politicians with great ambitions are embarking on the path of war, concentrating their minds and strength on military affairs to achieve immediate victory. Those who have not embarked on the path of war are maneuvering diplomatically to achieve future victory. Therefore, on one hand, some countries recognize this as a matter of life and death, while on the other hand, some countries see this as a good opportunity to expand their territory and gain rights.</p>
<p>In Southern Europe, Italy has unleashed the surging waves of war, while in Northern Europe, Germany is quietly awaiting the opportunity to achieve its goal of fishing in troubled waters. As Italy is currently preoccupied and unable to pay attention to Austria-Hungary, which it has always regarded as off-limits, the National Socialist Party believes that a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity has arrived for Germany. We are once again seeing German diplomats active in Eastern Europe. The signing of the German-Polish ten-year non-aggression treaty has transformed Poland from a French satellite into a German "partner." Now, Hitler is taking advantage of Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös's visit to Germany to conduct secret negotiations and reportedly plans to conclude a five-year non-aggression treaty with Austria. The purpose of this is undoubtedly to organize a German-Polish-Austrian-Hungarian bloc to counter the Central European Little Entente group and the Eastern European Baltic group – Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia.</p>
<p>The National Socialist Party's view of the Baltic Sea as its own possession has long been evident in the plans of the National Socialist Party spokesman, Rosenberg. Not only are National Socialist propaganda pamphlets frequently distributed within these three countries, but the activities of National Socialist Party members often threaten the current governments of the three countries. Therefore, these three countries have undergone a transformation since the National Socialist Party came to power, shifting their fear from the Soviet Union to Germany. To defend against their common enemy, the Baltic Entente was signed. The main content of the agreement is to stipulate that the three countries should have a common diplomatic position and that the three foreign ministers should meet once a year to decide on major foreign policies to deal with external aggression. However, these provisions are fundamentally political rather than military. If the National Socialist Party implements its "Eastern Policy," it is questionable whether these three countries can deal with it consistently and whether the three countries have the strength to deal with it. Germany's wait-and-see approach has now become an open secret, especially evident in its attitude towards the Memel question. Germany's particular hostility towards Lithuania has its own special reasons. However, its main purpose is still to expand its territory. Therefore, any country that hinders its ambition is the country it hates. Lithuania is just the first to bear the brunt, and Memel is just the beginning.</p>
<p>Memel became a focal point for the National Socialist Party because Memel originally belonged to Germany before the war and was governed by the League of Nations after the war. In 1923, Memel was occupied by Lithuania. In 1924, representatives from Britain, Japan, Italy, and France met in Paris and recognized Lithuania's sovereignty. However, at the same time, they granted Memel a considerable degree of autonomy. The area has a parliament, with members elected by the local population, and a governor, appointed by Lithuania. The governor and parliament often clash, and the local people's feelings towards Lithuania are extremely negative. This phenomenon provides Germany with an excuse to oppose Lithuania. Therefore, after the Saar plebiscite in the spring of this year, Germany had the slogan of holding a plebiscite in Memel to return to Germany, following the Saar example. In fact, the status of Memel should not be equated with that of the Saar. However, in the minds of the Germans, they have no time to consider this. Taking Memel for themselves is their only goal. The National Socialist Party's aim in this local parliamentary election is to win more seats in parliament and overthrow Lithuanian rule in one fell swoop. The election has now ended, but the results are still uncertain. The Lithuanian officials cannot sit idly by and watch their territory fall into the hands of others. In Germany, they believe that Memel's return to Germany is a foregone conclusion. There is no possibility of compromise between the two sides on this point. The international situation has made it difficult for countries such as Italy, France, Britain, and Japan, which guarantee Memel's return to Lithuania, to avoid being drawn into the vortex and have no time to care about Lithuania's suffering. Therefore, the future of the Memel question is bleak. Moreover, this is not only a problem for Lithuania alone or the Baltic countries, but also a problem concerning world peace.</p>

<h3>Anglo-French Paris Conference Decides to Continue Cooperation; French Cabinet Approves Economic Sanctions, Awaiting League of Nations Decision for Implementation</h3>
<p>(Paris) French Premier Laval and British Cabinet Minister Eden discussed the agenda for the League of Nations Council meeting on Saturday and Sunday at the Foreign Ministry here today. The discussion lasted for one hour and fifteen minutes. Afterwards, a communiqué was issued stating that the British and French officials had studied various procedures to be adopted by the Council meeting. Upon arrival in Geneva, the two sides will continue to cooperate. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) The cabinet held an emergency meeting at 2:30 p.m. today. It is reported that Laval has received almost unanimous support for the League of Nations Council to determine Italy as an aggressor and to decide on economic sanctions against Italy. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to semi-official sources, Laval and Eden have agreed that sanctions will be purely economic and financial in nature, implemented gradually in stages over a period of time. The timeline for each stage and the focus of gradual implementation will be determined later. It is necessary for the League of Nations to first determine who is the aggressor before considering any sanctions. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today's cabinet meeting will approve the Anglo-French cooperation agreement. British Minister for League of Nations Affairs Eden and French Premier and Foreign Minister Laval have already reached an agreement on this matter. It is widely believed here today that this important resolution will promote an Anglo-French defensive military alliance. However, the Foreign Ministry denied today that Eden and Laval had already discussed economic sanctions, saying that this matter should be decided by the League of Nations. However, it is understood that the two officials did agree on a plan to quickly contain the African war. The cabinet will therefore decide to assist Britain in enforcing the League Covenant in the League of Nations. (National News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) The government is scheduled to hold a cabinet meeting at 5 p.m. to decide on a policy regarding the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. Premier and Foreign Minister Laval will present a report on his discussions with British Minister without Portfolio Eden yesterday afternoon. It is reported that Laval explained the French government's views to Eden yesterday: first, France is prepared to participate in sanctions if the issue can be negotiated and approved internationally; second, France will request that Britain accept mutual obligations, that is, if France takes sanctions against Italy, then in the event of other incidents in Europe, other countries in danger, such as Czechoslovakia, which may be in danger, must be assisted, and it is hoped that Britain will support France at that time; third, France wants to clearly distinguish between collective action and individual action, and hopes that Anglo-French cooperation will not be limited to current acts of aggression, but will also jointly prepare for sanctions against the threat of aggression, so as not to be accused of instigating this act of aggression. In short, Premier Laval emphasizes mutual cooperation between Great Britain and France, including cooperation between the Anglo-French general staffs, in order to prevent the threat of aggression, that is, to enhance the effectiveness of the Locarno Pact. As for accepting mutual obligations, Eden has made some guarantees, but the two sides have not fully agreed on the manner in which sanctions should be implemented against Italy. Laval will explain three points to Eden: (A) French public opinion is divided on the issue of sanctions, and most believe that good understanding should be maintained with both Great Britain and Italy at the same time; (B) Negotiations can still be conducted with Italy before the League of Nations meeting designates the aggressor and before sanctions are implemented; (C) France's final attitude will be decided by the cabinet meeting. Today's cabinet meeting will take into account French public opinion and only consider economic sanctions, starting with severing commercial relations as a means of dealing with Italy. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>(Paris) News here today is that France must first establish an Anglo-French air force alliance before allowing Britain to assist it if it is attacked by the Italian or other countries' navies without provocation. British Minister without Portfolio Eden is said to have been ordered to notify France that the current Italo-Abyssinian conflict cannot be used as a pretext to force Britain to conclude this treaty with France against European aggressor countries. Furthermore, according to reliable sources, British officials have begun to study whether to prohibit Italian warships from passing through the Suez Canal, but there is currently no indication of sealing off the canal and prohibiting all ships from passing through. (National News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) Minister for League of Nations Affairs Eden has returned home to coordinate with the government and has taken the route through Paris to Geneva. Eden has been given secret orders to insist on implementing sanctions against any country that violates the League Covenant. (National Society News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) British cabinet members are preparing to convene an emergency cabinet meeting on Saturday and Sunday after the Council meeting in Geneva. If the issue of sanctions is to become a reality, then a special session of Parliament will be convened to pass the plans proposed by the cabinet. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Thirteen-Nation Committee met today for two and a half hours and decided to order the previous Five-Nation Committee, which failed to mediate, to investigate "the differences between Italy and Abyssinia" and then report on the strengths and weaknesses of the two countries in this dispute. Abyssinia has reported to the League of Nations that Italian planes bombed the Red Cross hospital near Aduwa, dropping 78 bombs. However, the Thirteen-Nation Committee has decided to notify Abyssinia that, given the change in circumstances, there is no need to send neutral observers as requested by Abyssinia. Italian circles here have all stated that the claim that Italian planes bombed Aduwa is groundless and have verbally denied it to the League of Nations Secretariat. The Thirteen-Nation Committee has dispatched the Five-Nation Committee to revise the historical facts of the dispute in the report drafted by the League of Nations Secretariat. The committee did not discuss the situation caused by today's events, as the Council will meet on Saturday and Sunday to discuss how to deal with this matter. (National News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) After arriving here from Britain, British Minister without Portfolio Eden, accompanied by British Ambassador to France Clerk, visited Premier and Foreign Minister Laval at the Foreign Ministry at 5:50 p.m. At 8 p.m., Laval declared to Havas reporters, "British Minister without Portfolio Eden and I have just discussed the procedures for the League of Nations Council meeting. The Council has now decided to meet on Saturday morning. In addition, the two of us have carefully studied the various procedures contained in the League Covenant. In short, we will continue to cooperate in Geneva." (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Council has decided to meet at 10:30 a.m. on Saturday. It is learned here today that Italy is likely to follow in the footsteps of Japan and Germany and withdraw from the League of Nations. The current issue facing the League of Nations is whether member states, under the leadership of Great Britain, are prepared to impose economic or military sanctions on Italy. It is generally believed that moderate economic sanctions are feasible, but there are doubts about military sanctions. It is also learned that the League of Nations has decided to request assistance from the United States to counter Italian aggression. This assistance will include the following points: (1) the United States will send observers to Abyssinia; (2) it will invoke the Neutrality Act, prohibiting the transport of arms to belligerent countries; (3) it will join in economic sanctions, boycotting Italian goods and refusing to sell any goods to Italians. (National News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) British Minister without Portfolio Eden arrived here this morning from Paris and met with Spanish representative Madariaga, chairman of the Thirteen-Nation Committee on the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, and informed him that the working procedures of the committee had been agreed upon in Paris, that is, the committee would submit a report to the Council, limited to describing the origins of the dispute, and that political issues, especially the issue of sanctions, would be decided by the Council itself. Eden plans to meet with representatives of the member states of the Council in the afternoon. British sources have expressed satisfaction with the discussions between Eden and French Premier Laval yesterday, saying that Great Britain and France have reached complete agreement. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Receives Report of Italian Aircraft Bombing; 76 Canisters Dropped on Aduwa</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Today, the Secretariat of the League of Nations received a telegram from the Abyssinian Emperor stating that planes had again attacked the town of Aduwa for the second time today, dropping a total of 76 bombs, one of which hit the Red Cross hospital. The League of Nations is once again in a dilemma regarding today's incident, as it must determine whether the act of aggression has already been realized and, if so, who is responsible. If the League of Nations Council makes a judgment based on unverified reports, the impact will be extremely serious. If the act of aggression has been verified, it is expected that the Council will ask the aggressor to withdraw to its original lines and will propose other suggestions for ending the war. This move will require the convening of the League of Nations General Assembly, but it cannot be convened before the end of next week. The Thirteen-Nation Committee met today to discuss the report drafted by the League of Nations Secretariat. Although the League of Nations is proceeding with everything as quickly as possible, today's incident has still caught the League of Nations off guard. The committee now feels that it cannot cope with this new situation, so it has decided to convene a Council meeting on Saturday. The committee has also decided to notify the Abyssinian government that, in view of recent developments, it is no longer necessary to send observers to Abyssinia. Italian circles here all claim that the claim that Italian planes bombed Aduwa is groundless and have verbally denied it to the League of Nations Secretariat. The Thirteen-Nation Committee has sent the Five-Nation Committee to revise the historical facts of the dispute in the report drafted by the League of Nations Secretariat. The committee did not discuss the situation caused by today's incident, as the Council will meet on Saturday and Sunday to discuss how to deal with this matter. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Rome) Military authorities told Associated Press reporters today that the primary objective of the Italian army is to encircle French and British Somaliland in order to prevent arms from being shipped into Abyssinia after the two countries lift the arms embargo. (National News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Italian Embassy here sent a letter to the League of Nations this morning denying that Italian troops had occupied Mausaari or advanced in that direction. At the same time, the Abyssinian government also telegraphed the Secretariat of the League of Nations denying that Abyssinia had taken any action to provoke the Italian invasion. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>The Situation in the Mediterranean</h3>
<p>Gibraltar Exercises Air Defense; Six French Submarines Open in the Philippines</p>
<p>Gibraltar Today the local sea and air forces held a joint air defense exercise. All the lights in the city were turned off at night. When the air force carried out a simulated bombing, all the lights on the warships on the harbor surface and the cars on the road were also turned off. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Alexandria After receiving the news that the war in East Africa has broken out, the local authorities immediately ordered the police to gather at important locations, ordered the town to prepare for unexpected changes, and sent military police to station at the submarine cable bureau. All Italian police had surrendered their weapons a week ago (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Algiers Six French submarines arrived here today, and a large number of warships will probably arrive again, because the Mediterranean has reached a dangerous level (National News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) British jurists are now studying the issue of prohibiting Italian military vessels from passing through the Suez Canal. There is still doubt as to whether this move is an economic sanction or an act of war. (National News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>Athens The Naval Department today telegraphed all Greek ships to avoid passing through the Suez Canal as much as possible. This move is thought to be out of fear that a crisis will occur there, causing "trouble." (National News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<h3>US State Department Drafts Arms Embargo Order</h3>
<p>To be issued after confirmation of war news</p>
<p>(Washington) The United States is quite concerned about the development of the situation in East Africa, as it may spread to Europe. Today, the State Department held another important meeting, attended by Mr. Moore, Director of the Near East Division, which shows that the State Department has paid attention to the future of the Mediterranean. Secretary of State Hull today also consulted with Undersecretary Phillips, Assistant Secretary Moore, and Mr. Dunn, an expert on African affairs. (National News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull and the State Department have drafted an order declaring a ban on arms exports, which will be submitted to President Roosevelt for approval as soon as the situation in East Africa is officially confirmed. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull said today that the United States must wait for the situation to become clear before implementing an arms embargo on Italy and Abyssinia. Therefore, the US government is unlikely to take any action before receiving an official report confirming that the war has indeed begun. The State Department has not yet received this report, but the government also has its central idea, which is to maintain neutrality. Hull also said that no other country has consulted the United States on its attitude towards implementing sanctions. According to previous news from London, the British Foreign Office was preparing to consult the United States. Observers believe that the United States may cooperate with the League of Nations as much as possible within the scope of its constitution and laws to maintain world peace. (National News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>(New York) An anti-fascist riot broke out here today. The authorities urgently summoned 1,250 special police officers to suppress it. Black people in Harlem had clashed with Italian expatriates in New York. School children in Brooklyn were also said to have had similar racial strife. (National News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Japan Strictly Adheres to Neutrality</h3>
<p>And hopes that the League of Nations will resolve it peacefully</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government telegraphed its ambassadors and ministers to various countries on the morning of the 4th, stating Japan's attitude toward the Italo-Abyssinian War and instructing them to convey it to the governments of the countries they were stationed in. The content roughly stated that the Japanese government would strictly adhere to a neutral attitude toward the Italo-Abyssinian War and hoped that the League of Nations would resolve the war peacefully. (Japanese United News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs refused to criticize the League of Nations' decision to impose sanctions on Italy and could not predict what action Japan would take regarding the League of Nations' future decisions, but said that it was necessary to wait for the situation to become clear. The spokesman replied to questions from reporters, saying that if the Italo-Abyssinian War breaks out, Japan will bear the full responsibility of a neutral country in accordance with international conventions. Japan is not a member of the League of Nations and therefore has no obligations to the League of Nations. The League of Nations must be maintained by the member states of the League of Nations themselves. If the maintenance of the League Covenant depends on the cooperation of non-member states, then the existence of the League of Nations can be said to depend on non-member states. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>Rumors of an October Coup in Japan</h3>
<p>The military will demand a thorough investigation of the Mingzheng case; the Okada cabinet will have difficulty remaining in office</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In order to cope with the Second World War that has already broken out, the instigation of right-wing groups, and the internal discord of the Okada Cabinet, the Japanese October coup theory that was temporarily spread in the political circles has once again raised its head. The main reason is that the military, rural veterans' groups, and various right-wing groups have expressed strong opposition to the non-prosecution case of Dr. Mino. It is reported that Minister of the Army Kawashima will represent the military and demand that Prime Minister Okada immediately dismiss Councilor Igi and Director-General of the Legislation Bureau Kanamori and make another statement clarifying the state system. If Okada does not approve, he may resign immediately. It is said that the opinions of the Ministry of the Navy are also becoming more radical. Naval Minister Osumi and fleet officers will also express the same attitude as Minister Kawashima. Therefore, the fate of the current Okada Cabinet is very urgent. Rumors of a coup within this month are therefore rampant. The most promising candidates for the next cabinet are currently Saito, Ugaki, Hiranuma, Konoe, and Minami. However, the Ugaki cabinet theory, which was the most hopeful in the past, has disappeared due to the Nagata incident. The same is true for the Minami cabinet. The Hiranuma and Konoe cabinets seem to be too early. Therefore, it is inferred that Saito is the most likely to succeed as prime minister. If so, the candidates for cabinet members will not be beyond the following situation: (Prime Minister) Saito Makoto, (Home Minister) Yamamoto Tatsuo, (Finance Minister) Takahashi Korekiyo, (Foreign Minister) Hirota Koki, (Agriculture Minister) Goto Fumio, (Commerce Minister) Machida Chuji, (Communications Minister) Yoshida Shigeru, (Railway Minister) sent from the House of Peers, (Education Minister) Horiguchi Yoshijiro, (Colonial Minister) Yamamoto Jotaro, (Justice Minister) Suzuki Kisaburo, the two military ministers will still be re-elected, (Chief Secretary) Karasawa Toshiki. The characteristic of this new cabinet is that it is linked with the Seiyukai to replace the new parties such as Uchida and Yamazaki, or it may welcome Seiyukai President Suzuki to join the cabinet. However, its nature as a bureaucratic, political party, and military bloc regime has not changed. (China Alliance News Agency, 4th)</p>
<h3>Japan's Western Mutual Conference; Concrete Policies Toward China</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) After the cabinet meeting on the 4th, Prime Minister Okada, Minister of Finance Takahashi, Foreign Minister Hirota, and Minister of the Army Kawashima discussed the fundamental policy toward China, which was previously decided by the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Army, and Navy. Foreign Minister Hirota first reported that in view of the situation in North China, it was necessary to rebuild the policy toward China, and the process of internally determining the policy toward China was agreed upon by the various ministries. Next, Minister of Finance Takahashi also expressed his opinions. Finally, the ministers discussed various concrete matters, and the meeting was adjourned after an hour.

<h3>Situation of Our Citizens Amidst the Italo-Abyssinian Conflict</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Today, someone visited Wang Zhiyuan, Secretary-General of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and inquired about the recent situation of our citizens in Abyssinia, East Africa, and Italy. According to him, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has already conducted a survey of the number of overseas Chinese in South Africa, but there are no accurate survey reports for the East African region. Although there are records, they may not be accurate. However, the number of overseas Chinese in East Africa is very limited. Although there are more overseas Chinese in Italy, they are currently stable. Unfortunately, the Italo-Abyssinian dispute has finally led to a war, and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission will instruct the citizens there to plan for their safety in the vicinity. (Special Dispatch, 4th)</p>
<h3>The Impact on Our Country Following the Outbreak of Hostilities Between Italy and Abyssinia</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign dispatches report the outbreak of war between Italy and Abyssinia. As of the fourth of this month, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not yet received a telegram from Liu Wendao, our ambassador to Italy. General observation suggests that the Italo-Abyssinian war is not merely a dispute between the two countries, but sufficient to affect world peace. Various international relations will be affected, and the impact on our country's foreign trade will be especially apparent. Economic expert Ma Yinchu said that if the war is limited to Italy and Abyssinia, China can barely hope to maintain its position even amidst the global economic recession. However, if it widens even slightly, China's silk and tea exports will greatly decline or even become completely unsalable, which will have a significant economic impact on China. Regarding the current economic situation in China, the people of the country should work together for stability. Furthermore, Shi Cigu Piyagang said that with the outbreak of the Italo-Abyssinian war, the extent of involvement of European countries will inevitably lead to its impact on the world economy, which is beyond doubt. Our country's foreign trade will inevitably suffer a blow. The Ministry of Industry has been paying attention to this since the occurrence of the Italo-Abyssinian issue and is planning measures to deal with Sino-foreign trade after the outbreak of war. These measures are still in the planning stage. (Fourth day special dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Finance Strictly Orders the Investigation and Prohibition of Speculators Spreading Rumors</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Recently, the Ministry of Finance noted that a small number of speculators in Shanghai are creating various rumors and wantonly slandering major banks, which foreign newspapers are using without scrutiny. This is disrupting the market and financial order and violating the law. On the fourth of the month, separate letters and telegrams were sent to the military and police authorities in Shanghai, ordering them to rigorously investigate and arrest those spreading rumors and to severely punish them.

<h3>Wu Heling Pays Respects to Wang</h3>

Furthermore, whether Yu Feipeng will go to Mongolia needs to be determined next week. (Fourth day Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wu Heling, head of the Mongolian League and Banner Offices in Nanjing, went to the Executive Yuan at 10:00 AM on the fourth to pay respects to President Wang and reported on the situation of the West Gong Banner. After listening to the report, Wang stated to Wu that our country is currently in a time of crisis, and internal misunderstandings should be eliminated. We should unite as one to strengthen border defense. The Central Government is determined to resolve the West Gong Banner dispute through fair and appropriate measures, so that all parties can accept it. He asked Wu to convey the Central Government's intentions to all parties, asking them to make concessions and not insist on their original positions. Furthermore, Li Hongwen, the representative of the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters, also reported to President Wang on the fourth. (Fourth day special dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Mongolian Political Council's Office in Beiping is Established</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Mongolian Political Council's office in Beiping was established today. Bao Yueqing, the head of the office, reported to the press today on the establishment of the office. Bao said that the two princes, De and Yun, arrived at Bailingmiao on the first of this month and have telegraphed committee members in various places, asking them to attend the meeting before the ninth to participate in the general assembly. He will remain in Beiping, waiting to travel with the committee members. Regarding the West Gong Banner dispute, there is currently no progress. It is said that the Central Government will send Yu Feipeng to the north to mediate, but the Mongolian side has not received this report. (Fourth day special dispatch)</p>
<h3>Dispute Over French Road Construction in Wuchuan County</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A person from Wuchuan County, Guangdong, who came to Nanjing, spoke about the dispute over French road construction. The Jin Yu Village and other places in the Sanbai Township of Dong'an Town, Wuchuan County, are all adjacent to Guangzhou Bay (Kwangchow Wan), but are separated by the Honggou River. The area south of the river is a French concession, and the area north of the river belongs to Wuchuan County. Since the demarcation, several decades have passed, and peace has always prevailed. A month ago, the French authorities in Guangzhou Bay suddenly encroached north of the Honggou River from Hongling and built a military road in Sanbai Township. According to the road construction plan, they planned to cross the Honggou River from Hongling, pass through Jin Yu Village, and then turn back to build along the shoreline of the Honggou River. The Wuchuan County Government telegraphed the Provincial Government, requesting instructions on how to respond. The Provincial Government immediately sent a letter to Gan Jiehou, the Foreign Affairs Inspector for Guangdong and Guangxi, to negotiate with the French authorities stationed in Guangdong. At that time, the road from Hongling to Jin Yu Village, about one li in length, had already been built. After Gan's negotiations, the French authorities were able to consider Sino-French relations and immediately stopped the construction of this section of the road. However, after the construction of this section of the road was stopped, they hired hundreds of workers a month ago to build a military road eastward from the beach near the Nine Mothers Temple. However, this beach leads directly to the ocean and is an important waterway for ships to transport goods. Now that the French are blocking the beach to build a road, it will greatly affect the future transportation of ships and the livelihoods of the people. Gan is currently negotiating with the French authorities, and a resolution should be reached soon. (Fourth day special dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Shantou Case is Expected to be Resolved Locally</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Shantou rice tax dispute has been resolved locally through negotiations between Gan Jiehou, the Shantou Municipal Government, and the Japanese side, and there is generally no problem. A certain committee member from Guangdong received a private telegram from Guangzhou yesterday stating that the Guangdong Provincial Government has not paid enough attention to this matter. After the Japanese Consul-General stationed in Guangzhou raised the issue with the authorities, the authorities replied that this matter falls within the scope of local negotiations and agreed to handle it locally. They also, at the request of the Japanese side, specially instructed the inspector's office and the Shantou Municipal Government to handle the matter carefully and maintain good relations between the two countries. Foreign dispatches have exaggerated the matter. Furthermore, according to information from our diplomatic circles, the Japanese Embassy has never formally raised this matter with our Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (Fourth day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Li Hanun was ordered by the Provincial Government to telegraph the province for instructions on how to handle the Japanese merchants' smuggled goods seized in Shantou, handling it with caution. On the third, a batch of rice was first shipped by Japanese merchants to the province, who refused to pay the special agricultural product tax and directly transported it to warehouses in Shamian. The Department of Finance reported to the headquarters and requested instructions from the Provincial Government. Since the previous month, Japanese merchants have often imported other kinds of goods, refusing to pay the special tax. The Agricultural Tax Bureau seized a batch of Japanese paper, which was subsequently returned after negotiations by the Japanese consul. The Agricultural Tax Bureau's monthly revenue was 1.5 to 1.6 million. Since the Japanese began smuggling goods, it has sharply decreased, falling to 900,000 last month. (Fourth day dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Zhang Yuanfu, the representative of Xinjiang stationed in Tianjin, stated that communication between Dihua and the Tianjin office has been constant, and his personal friendship with Governor Sheng is strong. If there were any matters such as alliance with Russia or communist affiliation, he would never conceal them from him. Foreign newspapers continue to use their old tricks of fabricating rumors, which are not worth refuting. However, many people in the country are not clear about the situation in Xinjiang, so it is necessary to clarify. Xinjiang has complex ethnicities, and many people believe in religion. In this regard, it is impossible to tolerate communism, let alone Governor Sheng. Even if he had this intention, the various ethnic groups would never agree. Recently, the Xinjiang Industrial and Commercial Bank, telegraph offices, schools, and rural cooperatives have been successively established, with everything that central banks should have. More than 150 schools have been established, and recently, more than 100 teachers and civil servants who resigned have been hired from Beiping and are waiting to be transported by train. These talents do not have communist ideology or theories, and Xinjiang's hiring of them proves that the rumors of communist affiliation are inaccurate. (Fourth day special dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Process of Amending the Law on Appeals</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Civil Service Office of the National Government previously received appeals from the Min'an Co., Ltd. due to dissatisfaction with the decision of the Training Directorate regarding the case of long-term occupancy of houses, and from Wang Dunxu Hall in Wuxi due to dissatisfaction with the decision of the Executive Yuan regarding the case of land disputes. They filed further appeals to the Civil Service Office of the National Government one after another. The office considered that the issue of jurisdiction over further appeals filed by agencies directly under the National Government was still doubtful under the current system. After signing its opinions, it was submitted to the Judicial Yuan for interpretation. The Judicial Yuan replied that there were no relevant provisions in the current laws and regulations that could be used for interpretation. Therefore, it was again submitted to the Central Political Council for review. After the review by the Legal System Group of the Central Political Council, the following principles were supplemented: Anyone who is dissatisfied with the decisions or dispositions of agencies not directly under the National Government of the Five Yuan does not need to go through the further appeal procedure and may directly file an administrative lawsuit. The Secretariat of the Central Political Council further added that this supplemented principle of the Legal System Group is in line with actual needs, but there are still two doubts: (1) When filing an appeal against a decision or disposition of the Five Yuan and agencies directly under the National Government, which should be the accepting agency? (2) According to the current laws and regulations, people can only file an administrative lawsuit against a decision on further appeal if the original decision is illegal. This decision of the Legal System Group seems to allow the filing of administrative lawsuits regardless of whether the decision is illegal or inappropriate, and the boundary seems unclear. When this review report of the Legal System Group was submitted to the Central Political Council, Minister of Justice Wang Yongbin also advocated deleting the last sentence of the principles of the Legal System Group, "may directly file an administrative lawsuit." The Central Political Council then decided to submit the letter from the Civil Service Office of the National Government, the review opinions of the Legal System Group, Wang Yongbin's opinions, and the Secretariat's annotations to the Legislative Yuan for review. After the review by the Legislative Yuan on the fourth, the Law on Appeals was amended to allow those who are dissatisfied with the decisions of the Five Yuan or other agencies directly under the National Government to file an appeal with the original agency. At the same time, the Administrative Litigation Law was also amended to allow those who are dissatisfied with a decision made in accordance with the Law on Appeals after filing an appeal or further appeal against an illegal disposition to file an administrative lawsuit.

<h3>Westbound Observations</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Ji Yuan</p>
<p>On the Way to Hankou</p>
<p>On the evening of September 19, this reporter and Mr. Song Hua took the Minsheng Company's Minyang ship for a tour of Sichuan. At about 1:00 AM on the 20th, we drove past Zhenjiang in the lights of the night. On the morning of the 21st, we passed Wuhu. Along the way, the wind was gentle and the sun was bright, and the smoke waves were vast. The disaster scenes of the rain-soaked coast were still vivid. When passing Anqing, it was already twilight, and the evening wind invaded the skin, with a slight chill of late autumn. The afterglow of the setting sun shone on the river, forming a golden color. From time to time, three or four foreign warships and foreign merchant ships drove downwind. The machines and flags fluttered in the dim light, making them even more majestic. At about 5:00 PM on the 12th, the ship arrived in Hankou and berthed at the North German Second Wharf. Because we had to stay in Hankou for several days, we packed our luggage and disembarked.</p>
<p>Impressions After Arriving in Wuhan</p>
<p>Wuhan is a place this reporter has visited before. At that time, before the great flood of the 20th year [of the Republic], the deep impressions left in my mind were "four mores." First, there were more slogans, dazzling and diverse. Second, there were more leather belts, majestic and awe-inspiring. Taking rickshaws would not cost money. Third, there were more killings. From Zhongshan Road to Liubao Bridge, one could see announcements of executions almost every day. Fourth, there were more opium dens and prostitutes, standing everywhere, doing all kinds of evil. This time, revisiting the old place, I feel that the situation has changed somewhat. Although the dazzling slogans can still be seen everywhere, they all seem to be the symbols of the New Life Movement. The slogans of the New Life Movement, "Observe etiquette, know righteousness, be honest, be responsible, and abide by discipline," are the most fashionable slogans. "Simple, plain, realistic, and rapid" are the creeds of the New Life Movement. But unfortunately, these slogans cannot achieve any great effect. In recent days, the Wuhan authorities have been racking their brains over the diplomatic disputes over the slogans. This shows that slogans cannot be posted casually as before.</p>
<p>The majesty of the leather belts has indeed decreased somewhat compared to before, but the majesty of the police has replaced the majesty of the leather belts. According to the survey, incidents of execution seem to be less common. These can be said to be relatively progressive phenomena.</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the New Life Movement, the opium dens and prostitutes in Hankou seem to have decreased on the surface. The situation of selling opium pipes along the street and opening opium dens everywhere is not easily seen after strict crackdowns. However, those familiar with the situation can still list them without omission. It is said that the current anti-smoking policy of the authorities focuses on integrating prohibition into taxation. The annual tax revenue can reach about 10 million yuan, with the aim of completely eliminating it within a few years. Since the ban on prostitution, the prostitutes have moved to the French Concession. The French Concession authorities levy heavy prostitute taxes on prostitutes, increasing a very large income. There are many newly established hotels in the French Concession, and business is still not bad. On the other hand, large and small hotels in the Chinese Concession are all deserted.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a special phenomenon that has occurred in recent years, which is the low cost of labor. Taking rickshaw fares as an example, comparing the rickshaws in the three towns of Wuhan with the rickshaws in Shanghai, the former are several times cheaper than the latter. Often, a journey of four or five li only costs four or five cents, and the rickshaw drivers are still fighting over it. (On average, excluding rent, they can earn about 20 cents a day.) When this reporter first disembarked, the rickshaw drivers were fighting over a one-cent business, and three or five of them almost fought each other, resulting in blood stains on the reporter's hands. If we look at them, their emaciated appearance makes us feel infinite sympathy. As for the general unemployed elderly, weak, and women, their lives are even more miserable.</p>
<h3>Shandong Coal Merchants Plead for Relief</h3>
<p>Submitting to the Qingdao Municipal Government for Forwarding to the Ministry of Industry, Requesting the Central Government to Allocate Coal Industry Loans</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Eight companies, including Tongxing Coal Mine in Boshan and other places in eastern Shandong, are facing difficulties in sustaining their business due to the sharp drop in coal prices and lack of capital turnover. They have submitted a request to the Qingdao Municipal Government for forwarding to the Ministry of Industry for assistance, but no results have been obtained. Now that the merchants have heard that the Ministry of Industry is launching loans to assist the coal industry, they have united with their counterparts and submitted another request to the Municipal Government, requesting it to forward the loan request to the Ministry of Industry for assistance. The Municipal Government, upon receiving the request, has forwarded it to the Ministry of Industry to express their sincere plea. The merchants stated in their document to the Municipal Government: "It is found that the Boshan coal mine in eastern Shandong has abundant reserves and excellent quality. According to statistics, the annual output is no less than 2 million tons, and it is transported and sold to provinces both inside and outside the province. The sales volume in places such as Shanghai, Guangdong, Fujian, and Hankou almost exceeds that of our own province. However, since the January 28th Incident, the Shanghai market has been affected by the war, financial stagnation, and commercial depression. Coupled with the dumping of foreign coal, market prices have plummeted. It is even more difficult for domestic coal to maintain its business due to the lack of capital turnover. If the government does not provide assistance in the long run, it is feared that it will be inevitable that they will go bankrupt one after another. In the past, your government sympathized with the hardships of the merchants and advocated the distribution of production and joint sales to provide assistance, which was a good method and intention, and we are deeply grateful. However, as things went against expectations, it has not been realized so far, which has failed the government's intention to maintain industry. Recently, we have heard that the Ministry of Industry is carrying out loans to assist the national coal industry in order to re-lend and assist. The merchants are suffering from a lack of funds and are in a dilemma. Upon hearing the news, they all feel that there is a glimmer of hope for the future. After joint consultation, Zhuang Shuting and Sun Liangchen were recommended to represent them in petitioning the central government to allocate this loan in order to maintain their business. It is reasonable to present this request, requesting you to examine the situation below and approve the transfer to the Ministry of Industry to establish this loan and immediately provide loan assistance to maintain domestic coal and alleviate the difficulties of the merchants. It is a matter of public convenience. Respectfully submitted, Zhuang Shuting, Manager of Tongxing Coal Mine, Zhu Yaoru, Manager of Shandong Coal Mine, Sun Liangchen, Manager of Fuxing Coal Mine, Wang Yucun, Manager of Yide Coal Mine, Li Xingjie, Manager of Lihe Coal Mine, Meng Jingzhou, Manager of Daxing Coal Mine, Cheng Shaolu, Manager of Zhenye Coal Mine, and Cheng Shaolu, Manager of Luxing Coal Mine."</p>

<h3>Southern Journey Impressions</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Qian Hua of this Newspaper</p>
<p>(43) The Return Journey</p>
<p>Going down the Tan River from Guilin to Yangshuo, the scenery along the way is breathtaking and inexhaustible. Therefore, those who have traveled to Guilin say, "Boating to see the mountains is better than traveling on land." The reception committee also followed this principle, gathering more than seventy large horse-gate boats specifically for members to ride. They departed in batches from the waterway back to Wuzhou. Because it was flood season, the entire journey of 670 li was expected to take three days. If it were after September or October, when the water is shallow and dried up, it would take more than ten days. The reporter was in the last batch, boarding the boat at 10 p.m. on the 21st. The boat was docked beside a pontoon bridge, lined up with more than twenty others. Each boat had a host, carrying six or seven or three or four members, transporting luggage, saying farewell. The scene was extremely lively, and the water was as smooth as a mirror. With a gentle evening breeze, I sat on the bow of the boat, gazing at the shadows of the mountains, feeling broad-minded and free from worries. A nearby boat hired a Guilin folk singer, who played and sang by himself. The melody was like Suzhou Tan Huang, more than half of which I could understand. The crowd on the bridge gradually gathered, and the singer sang even more vigorously, making a disturbance until midnight before leaving. The reporter traveled by car on land for six days, driving for seven or eight hours each day, deeply feeling the hardship of traveling by car. Once switching from car to boat, I felt even more comfortable. The horse-gate boat was extremely spacious, with a cabin that could accommodate more than ten people. In the late Qing dynasty, these boats were originally for civil service examination candidates, so the boat ladies' cooking was particularly exquisite. The boatmen's entire families were engaged in labor, taking on the duties of boat owner, helmsman, cook, rower, and handyman. The order was well-maintained. A small boat was tied alongside, providing a place for the women, children, and girls to sleep. The arrangement was relatively clean, resembling a small room. At dawn on the 23rd, the creaking sound of the oars awakened me from a sweet dream. I got up to see that the boat had already set off, the evening scenery infinitely beautiful. Before long, we arrived at the foot of Elephant Trunk Hill. Looking afar at Rooster Fighting Hill, it truly resembled the image. Along the way, the water flowed rapidly, the cliffs and ravines were secluded and strange, sometimes standing upright in front of us, sometimes jade pillars stretched across the sky. The river course was winding, and the mountains turned with the water, like watching a scenic film, constantly changing. "Guilin's scenery is the best in the world," I now believed without doubt. The twenty-odd good boats chased after each other. On the bows of the boats, all that could be seen were dozens of camera boxes, busily working, which was quite interesting. The boatmen pointed out and explained as we traveled, "This is such-and-such mountain, with such-and-such historical sites; this is such-and-such place, with such-and-such scenic spots." After about three hours of travel, we suddenly saw a steep cliff facing us, the mountain shaped like a pen rack, with green, white, and red colors mixed together, mottled and colorful. The boatman said, "This is Painting Mountain." Faintly visible were several horses, equipped with bridles, some looking up, some looking down, extremely lifelike. Some blessed people could see as many as nine horses. Travelers often use this to predict their fortune. My companions said they saw two horses or four horses. I, the reporter, with my nearsightedness, saw a blurry mess, not a single horse visible. At 6 p.m., we finally arrived at Yangshuo, all boats tied up to the shore at dusk. The members disembarked one after another to visit. The streets and markets of Yangshuo County were extremely narrow, and there were no major merchants or wealthy families, so the situation was unusually desolate. For such a famous scenic area, the scene was like this, probably because transportation was blocked, and tourists just took a quick look and left, not even pausing slightly, thus causing it to become increasingly deserted. The members toured around for a week, and suddenly the evening clouds gathered, making it dark and difficult to distinguish faces. They hurried back to the boats in a panic. The roads were rugged and there were no lights. Fortunately, there were many people, and they took precautions against each other, safely crossing over and boarding the boats. Many people from Guangdong and Guangxi are accustomed to swimming, so because the water was shallow, they lit candles on the bow of the boat. Many members went into the water for a night swim, laughing and talking, full of interest. At dawn the next morning, the boat set sail downstream from Yangshuo. Because the river water gradually became shallow and there were many sandy beaches, the journey was slow. Moreover, from Yangshuo downstream, the scenery gradually became mediocre. The people's boats relied on manpower to navigate, and it gradually became annoying. We arrived at Pingle at noon. Pingle is a prosperous county, and because it is near the West River, everything has the atmosphere of a riverside town. The streets and markets were crowded. The members together went to Zhongshan Park for a short rest. The park used natural scenery as its backdrop, with lush trees, and had a unique charm. On this day, a motorboat going to Wuzhou was parked in the heart of the river. Because of time constraints, the reporter switched to the motorboat, which set sail at 3 p.m. on the 23rd and arrived in Wuzhou at 2 p.m. on the 24th. Military police boarded the boats and ships to search, overturning boxes and bags, extremely strict. The biggest purpose was to find opium. Guangxi relies heavily on opium transit taxes, so it had to strictly prevent smuggling. After staying in Wuzhou for one night, at 1 p.m. on the 25th, I boarded a Hong Kong-Wuzhou boat to Sanshui. Li Zongren's wife, Ms. Guo Dejie, also took the same boat to Guangdong. At 12 p.m. that night, the boat arrived in Sanshui, docked in the heart of the river. Small sampan women came to solicit customers, the situation was fierce. Fortunately, representatives from the Guangdong Provincial Association came to welcome us with large lanterns and prepared ferry boats to transport luggage, allowing us to safely overcome the difficult situation and reach the other shore. We walked about a mile from the ferry to the Guangzhou-1 railway station. The train was to depart at 6 a.m. The train was stuffy and hot, so we all walked on the platform to cool off. Nearby small food stalls, with red lanterns, welcomed guests, preparing chicken and duck congee, wontons, etc., business was booming, resembling the scene of a roadside inn in the north. The night felt long, and after a long time, the sky began to brighten slightly. Madame Li, accompanied only by two adjutants and a maid, with extremely simple luggage, also mingled with the members, waiting bitterly for half the night, without the slightest air of a noble lady, her frugality was admirable. The train departed at six o'clock and arrived at Shiwetang at eleven o'clock. There was a special boat waiting to welcome us, ferrying us to Guangzhou. The scorching heat of Guangzhou had not diminished, the temperature reaching around 100 degrees. It was even worse in the evening. The reporter and a friend took a stroll through the streets, purchasing local goods. At 4 p.m., I took a Hong Kong-Guangdong boat to Hong Kong. When I came, I took the Kowloon-Canton Railway, but this time I returned to Hong Kong by water, enjoying the scenery of Humen. Both the land and water scenery were excellent, it could not be said that my eyes were not blessed. The boat was owned by a British merchant, extremely clean and comfortable. The boat set sail at 4 p.m. I leaned on the railing, looking at the scenery of the Pearl River. At about 5 p.m., we passed Huangpu. From a distance, the white rooftops of the Huangpu Military Academy stood tall in the clouds, disappearing in an instant. At 6:30 p.m., we passed the Humen Fort. The terrain was indeed extremely dangerous. Leaving the Humen estuary, the setting sun was already setting, the remaining glow not yet faded, the distance appearing red, reflected in the sea appearing purple. The winding mountains were like a complete picture. The fishing boats were faint. The Humen sunset was one of the Eight Scenic Spots of Yangcheng, truly not an exaggeration. At 10 p.m., the boat arrived in Hong Kong, and I changed to the Tai Tung Hotel, because there were Shanghai servants. On the evening of the 27th, I boarded the Lincoln President of the Da Lai Company to return to Shanghai. We set sail at 6 a.m. on the 28th. The Chairman of Zhejiang Province, Huang Shaoxiong, and his family were also on the same boat. Huang was from Rong County, Guangxi, and was a classmate and close fellow townsman of Ye Qi. This time, Ye Qi was buried, and he came to hold the ropes. On the way, the Chairman and I discussed the construction and economic problems of Guangxi Province. Huang advocated that each province should develop its own resources with a spirit of self-reliance. Guangxi's tungsten and tin mines had great prospects. The central government was also economically strained. Rumors of subsidies for Guangxi were not true, he said. The boat arrived in Shanghai at 2 p.m. on the 30th. The southern journey was exactly one month long. (The End)</p>

<h3>Reorganization of Security Forces in the Hebei War Zone</h3>
<p>Li Fengyun, Zhao Dian, etc. relieved of duties, Liu Le, etc. causes a commotion</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch. In the past week, Yin Rugeng has been traveling busily between Pingjin, repeatedly meeting with Takeashita Yoshiharu, chief of the Kwantung Army's special service agency in Shanhaiguan; Sakai Takashi, chief of staff of the North China garrison army; Takahashi Tan, military attaché at the Japanese embassy in Ping; and others, to discuss the reorganization of the security forces in the war zone. The reorganization planned by our side is for the 3rd Security Brigade under Li Fengyun, the 4th Brigade under Zhao Lei, and the 5th Brigade under Feng Shoupeng and Luo Dongshu, which are awaiting integration. The methods for reorganizing the Li, Luo, and Feng units have been agreed upon and are being implemented in order. Only the Zhao unit has not yet been finalized. Yin specially came to Tianjin on the 1st to meet with Takeashita from Beidaihe to discuss again. It is heard that the most important issue in reorganizing the Zhao unit, such as the size of the force conforming to provincial regulations, a brigade commanding four battalions, with the number of officers and soldiers not exceeding two thousand, is still in discussion. At present, the Zhao unit exceeds this number and will be ordered to downsize and conform. When Li's unit was commanded by Liu Zuozhou, it commanded four battalions, one cavalry unit, and one training unit, with more than three thousand officers, soldiers, and laborers, exceeding the provincial regulations by about a thousand people. Because there was no military pay, they extorted from the local population every day. After Liu's death, his nephew, Liu Lesan, using his qualification as the cavalry battalion commander, controlled Li Fengyun, and appointed himself as the deputy commander of the brigade. Secretary-General Zhang Weixiang also appointed himself as the brigade adjutant. The two jointly controlled Li, causing Li to be uneasy in his position. Recently, after Yin Rugeng negotiated with the Japanese, on September 30, he summoned Li to Tangshan and secretly conveyed the provincial government's order, formally appointing him as the commander of the 3rd Brigade. Li returned to Luan County defense area that night, gathered all the officers for a briefing, and mobilized the 1st Battalion to guard the entire city, announcing the provincial order, removing Liu Lesan and Zhang Weixiang from their positions. Liu's cavalry, one company caused a mutiny that day, fleeing towards the coast. Li immediately sent troops to pursue and encircle and monitor the remaining cavalry battalion to prevent any disturbances. On the morning of the 1st of this month, Liu Lesan was summoned by the Japanese military police in Shanhaiguan, who said that Liu was colluding with the old warlords such as Bai Jianwu, and detained him. Zhang Weixiang, seeing the situation was not good, was demoralized. However, the county town, both inside and outside, is still under guard and has not relaxed. As for the Feng Shoupeng unit, although it was previously decided to be reorganized into the 3rd Battalion, commanding four companies, under the control of the 5th Brigade under Li Yunsheng, due to the occurrence of the North China Incident, there was no time to discuss this. Currently, the unit and the Luo Dongshu unit have been stationed in Tangshan for a long time, and the defense area is both crowded and very inconvenient. Therefore, the Feng unit was transferred to Changping for defense, and the Luo unit was transferred to Shunyi for defense. The Feng unit was reorganized into a battalion as previously agreed, called the 3rd Battalion of the 5th Security Brigade, commanding mortar, machine gun, pistol, and cavalry, with a total of 317 officers and soldiers. On October 5, they moved to the defense area, turning onto the Zunping-Yu Road to Ping and marching on foot. The Luo Dongshu unit, called the Special Service Company of the 5th Security Brigade, with 220 men, after moving to the defense area, will be thoroughly downsized, allowing 120 men to remain, also under the direct command of Li Yunsheng. The Luo unit departed from Tangshan on September 29, sent to Ping by the Ping-Yu train, changed to the Ping-Sui train, got off at Kangzhuang, and marched on foot. In the future, Tangshan will still be defended by the Zhao Lei unit. (2nd)</p>
<h3>The Yuehan Southern Railway: The Lechang-Pingshi Section is Open to Traffic</h3>
<p>Goods from Guangdong can directly reach the Hunan border, benefiting commerce between Hunan and Guangdong</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch. The north and south sections of the Yuehan Railway will soon be interconnected. At present, the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan section of the project is being actively carried out. The Lechang-Pingshi section of the southern section has been completed on schedule and officially opened to traffic on the 24th of this month. Locomotives and passenger and freight cars are temporarily supplied by the Yuehan Southern Railway Bureau, and ticket sales are handled by the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan Railway Bureau. Passengers and freight from Guangzhou to Pingshi must purchase separate tickets at Lechang. The fare from Lechang to Pingshi is 95 cents. After the completion of this section, goods from Guangdong Province can directly reach the Hunan border, which will greatly benefit commerce between Guangdong and Hunan. The transportation of goods from Guangdong to the Hunan border mainly consists of salt, textiles, and cloth. In recent years, due to the brisk sales of Huai salt in southern Hunan, the transportation of Guangdong salt to Hunan has decreased sharply, and the revenue of the railway bureau has also been affected. Last year, the railway's business revenue decreased by about 50,000 yuan compared to the previous year. The total revenue of the railway in the 23rd year is appended as follows: (1) Business revenue, transportation revenue, passenger business (passenger) 2,231,206 yuan 1 jiao 2 cents, (other) 328,083 yuan 1 jiao 2 cents, passenger business, (freight) 20,850,193 yuan 2 jiao 5 cents, freight business, (other) 1,136,609 yuan 7 cents, telegraph fee 725 yuan 4 jiao, total machinery plant profit 301 yuan 0 jiao 2 cents, rent 1,164 yuan 2 jiao 2 cents, miscellaneous 40,005 yuan, total of first category 4,462,868 yuan 7 jiao, total of second category 47,859 yuan 1 jiao 7 cents, total business revenue 45,100,727 yuan 9 jiao 4 cents.

Excluding expenses, the net profit of business revenue is 1,047,216 yuan 1 jiao 1 cent.</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Huzhou liner in Suzhou was robbed again</p>
<p>Chief Zhou of the Second District of the Water Police received a secret report that a large gang of lake bandits was lingering in Dongshan, Luzhi, and other places, plotting wrongdoing. He immediately ordered the Eighth Team to cooperate with the Zhaowu gunboat to search and suppress them separately. As the search was underway, news came that near Wujiagang, on the evening of the 3rd, a Shanghai-Huzhou liner was passing through the area when suddenly more than a dozen bandits came, carrying weapons to board the ship and rob the passengers. More than thirty passengers were not spared. After about an hour, the bandits left with their loot. After checking, the loss was about 2,000 yuan. At the time, the ship did not report to the police and went straight to Huzhou. The incident was within the jurisdiction of the Pingwang Public Security Sub-bureau, which immediately reported to the local water police and began to investigate. In addition, bandit traces were also found in the Taihu Lake area along the bottom of West Mountain. A stationed water police detachment has already been investigating. It is also heard that Chief Zhou, with the winter defense approaching in an instant, in order to maintain water security, will convene a meeting of the chiefs of each detachment within the day to discuss defense and bandit suppression issues.</p>

<p>Huzhou: Preparing to Establish the Huzhou National Goods Company</p>
<p>Wuxing, one of the six counties under Huzhou, is the commercial center area. The production of silk is famous and the market is prosperous. Recently, it was heard that local gentry Chen Qinshi, Shen Jifu, Zhang Rongchu, Han Juemin, etc., due to the lack of organization of the national goods industry in Huzhou, initiated the establishment of the Huzhou National Goods Company. Since the preparations began, it has been several months. It is heard that they have now surveyed the land on Shangbei Street in Wuxing City and are constructing and renovating the houses and decorating the interior. On the one hand, they are contacting national goods factories in Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other ports to sign sales contracts. It is expected that the preparations will be completed in the shortest possible time and the opening will be held.</p>
<p>Hangzhou: Disputes Before the Re-election of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The Hangzhou Municipal Chamber of Commerce will convene the fourth members' meeting on the 8th of this month to re-elect the executive and supervisory committee members. The chamber has been actively preparing for this in advance. Each industry association has recommended representatives to attend. There are quite a few people who are vying for the position of chairman. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce convened a joint meeting of the chairmen and committee members of each industry association on the 1st. Chairman Jin Runquan nominated nine candidates for the executive committee: Huang Xiaotong and Gan Zhenji of the banking industry, Chen Xiting of the money industry, Xie Huyong of the pawn industry, Xu Ligeng of the silk industry, Han Jiawei of the cloth industry, Chen Xingwu of the sauce industry, Gan Yangpo of the leather industry, and Zhou Shiluo of the new medicine industry. Gan Xinru of the silk weaving industry, Wu Jinqing of the banking industry, Fang Guansan of the tea industry, and Yu Xiuzhang of the pharmaceutical industry were nominated as candidates for the supervisory committee. This aroused the reaction of each industry association. Based on what laws and regulations are the eligibility and ineligibility of representatives of each industry determined? Jin's actions not only deprive the representatives of various seats of their right to be elected, but also have the suspicion of monopolizing the affairs of the association.</p>
<p>Ningbo: The Old Jiang Bridge Can Be Completed This Year</p>
<p>The old Jiang Bridge between the Tongcheng District and Jiangdong in this port was contracted out last spring by foreign firms such as Siemens to rebuild a steel-concrete bridge, requiring 700,000 yuan.

On the 3rd, he went to the contracting company and the person in charge of the preparatory committee for the construction of the old Jiang Bridge to inquire about the latest construction situation. It was reported that the bridge piers on both sides had been completed long ago, and the bridge beams had also been erected. They are currently laying the iron plates on the bridge deck. Once the iron plate project is completed, the final project of paving and pouring cement on the bridge deck can be carried out. It is also said that the project can be completed as scheduled. At present, the construction details of the road surfaces at both ends of the bridge abutment have also been determined and will be started soon.</p>
<h3>Aftermath of the Salt Folk Uprising in Yao County</h3>
<p>The salt folk in Yuyao have been in constant disputes since the salt merchants stopped receiving and weighing salt, causing the salt folk to lose their livelihoods. After many days, the salt administration authorities repeatedly tried to mediate, ordering the salt merchants to receive salt at 60% of the original rate, starting on the 1st of this month. The matter had come to an end. However, on the morning of the 2nd, more than two thousand salt folk from Langxia Township in the county rushed to the township office to petition and to the office of the Ba長 to beg for food. The head of the township agreed to request Magistrate Lin on their behalf, and each person was given ten copper coins as snack money. The salt folk then dispersed.</p>

<p>The Municipal Party Headquarters of this city has determined that the 11th of this month will be the anniversary of the Premier's peril in the Chinese Embassy in London, England, while diligently pursuing the revolutionary movement. At that time, fortunately, Mr. Kandelay managed to rescue him and prevent him from being harmed. From then on, the Premier persevered and was able to promote the doctrine and recover the city. This year marks the 39th anniversary. The headquarters has specially formulated commemorative measures and will convene representatives from all organs, groups, schools, and party departments in the city at 10 a.m. that morning in the headquarters' auditorium for a memorial service.

<h3>Italy Purchases Grain in Shanghai</h3>
<p>One hundred tons will be shipped back on an Italian ship</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that since the tension between Italy and Abyssinia, the price of rice and grain in this port has been rising daily, and it is rumored that Italy will purchase large quantities of grain in Shanghai. According to the export department of the shipping industry in this port, on the day of this month, the Italian ship Contessa Rosso will load 100 tons of grain when it departs from Shanghai to Italy.</p>
<p>Shen Shi News Agency reports that according to He Bingxian, Director of the International Trade Bureau, the Italo-Abyssinian War has only been in local contact. The prices of our raw materials, such as cotton and wheat, have already risen. If the official war begins, our foreign trade will inevitably tend to two ways: (1) The export of raw materials and semi-finished products such as miscellaneous grains, such as cotton, wheat, rice, beans, oil cakes, and metals such as tungsten ore sand and antimony, will inevitably increase sharply, and prices will also rise accordingly. (2) However, if the war expands and the Mediterranean is blocked, cutting off our transportation to Europe, then not only will the export of raw materials and other items fail to be smooth, but it will fall into a state of stagnation. In short, this matter will have a huge impact on our international trade, but it may not be beneficial to us.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed the Executive Yuan to Request Abolition of Guangdong Province's Special Agricultural Product Tax</h3>
<p>Agricultural Product Tax is More Onerous Than Lijin, Merely Creating Opportunities for Foreign Merchants to Entice the People</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Guangdong Provincial Government to request the abolition of Guangdong Province's special agricultural product tax. (Details omitted) According to a letter from the Zalianghaoye Guild on the 3rd of this month and a letter from Guangdong merchants traveling in Shanghai on the 26th of this month, the special agricultural product tax, which originated in Guangdong Province, imposes heavy taxes on essential daily necessities, making it more onerous than lijin. When the bureau for collecting the tax was established, the Guangdong government claimed that it was to resist foreign goods and protect domestic products. However, the result is that foreign goods, those that evade and leak taxes, are still treated as domestic products, and the Guangdong government's revenue is limited, while Guangdong merchants and non-Guangdong merchants, Guangdong farmers and non-Guangdong farmers, all suffer. The Guangdong Provincial Special Tax Bureau taxes all kinds of goods, but apart from foreign rice, the main foreign goods are soybeans from the Northeast Provinces. However, the amount of oil and beans transported to Guangdong Province each year from Zhili, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu is actually greater than that from the Northeast Provinces. If the same tax is levied, it would be equivalent to encouraging the import of Northeast soybeans and hindering the production and sales of goods from North and Central China. If products from non-Guangdong provinces are regarded as foreign goods, using tariff barriers to apply to one's own country is no different from severing one's own limbs. The Guangdong government is subordinate to the central government, and its policies should not be like this. If the provinces retaliate against each other, what kind of government will it be? Merchants should pay taxes according to regulations, and if it is beneficial to the country, they will do their best to contribute, even if the burden is slightly heavier. However, there are 20 to 30 foreign firms of a certain nationality that import and sell foreign rice without paying the special tax, and Chinese rice shops are almost all closed. The consulate of a certain country has also sent a special agent to clear customs and pick up goods on behalf of the foreign firms, claiming that the commercial treaty is not a tax rule promulgated by the central government, and does not pay various surcharges. Therefore, the Shantou Agricultural Product Special Tax Bureau collected more than 800,000 yuan in taxes per month, of which 400,000 to 500,000 yuan came from foreign rice. By the end of July this year, it collected more than 60,000 yuan, and by the end of August, it collected several thousand yuan. In this situation, foreign rice special tax will soon have no revenue to collect. Recently, some people have organized a joint-stock company to transport foreign rice and soybeans from the Northeast to Shantou. This means that the foreign soybean tax will soon have no revenue to collect. Shantou is like this, and Guangzhou is also like this. The facts are clear. The soybean tax will soon have nothing to collect except domestic products. Since the establishment of the Guangdong Provincial Special Tax Bureau, the tax on crude oil, soybean oil, and sesame oil has increased from 1.5 yuan to 5.4 yuan plus 10%, or 7.02 yuan in Guangdong currency, and the tax on soybeans, peanuts, sesame, and mountains has increased from 0.5 yuan to 1.8 yuan plus 30%, or 0.24 yuan in Guangdong currency. The tax rate is 30% to 40% or more of the value. Domestic oil and beans, burdened by this heavy tax, cannot compete with those from the three northeastern provinces that do not pay the special tax. In the future, those who are cunning will definitely seek refuge with foreign firms to evade taxes, and those who are honest will moan and eventually perish. At that time, the Guangdong government will only have an oppressive tax, which will cause suffering to merchants and farmers in various provinces, and will actually gain nothing. At this time of promoting domestic products and reviving rural areas, we are submitting this letter with the facts and requesting your association to investigate the above situation and forward it to the authorities in Nanjing and Guangdong to quickly find a way to maintain the situation and exempt the soybean and peanut special tax first, so that agricultural products from various provinces in the country can be freely transported to Guangdong for sale without being oppressed and manipulated by foreign merchants. This is to maintain national credibility, alleviate commercial difficulties, and would not only be a benefit to our industry, etc. The Association considered that the matter was closely related to its members and could not remain silent. It has always admired the leadership of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce in relieving the suffering of merchants, and hopes that you will sympathize with this request and forward it to the authorities in Nanjing and Guangdong, etc. After the lijin was abolished, provinces should no longer have the right to levy commodity taxes. This is a principle that must be strictly adhered to in order to maintain the unity of government orders. The Guangdong agricultural product special tax, in its nature, is a lijin in disguise, and its tax rate is even more burdensome than lijin. As costs increase, the burden on merchants becomes heavier. The honest people call out in vain and have no choice but to go bankrupt and close their businesses, while cunning people take refuge in foreign nationalities, causing the tax officials to turn a blind eye. This not only hinders national sovereignty and loses the people's hearts, but also destroys commerce, resulting in three harms at once. Merchants have been hoping for the abolition of lijin for decades, but they did not expect this tax system, which is more severe than lijin, to exist. It is truly regrettable. If we continue to maintain the current situation, it will only create opportunities for foreign merchants to entice the people. Public tax revenues will inevitably decrease day by day, and local disputes will be endless. What has happened in Shantou today is clear evidence of this. Therefore, it is better to adhere to the national order for the abolition of lijin and resolutely abolish it. We urge you to submit this telegram to the Council (Ministry) (Government) for review and approval and implementation. This would be to the benefit of the public. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. River.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Railways Instructs Two Railway Bureaus to Negotiate Price Reductions for Wheat and Cotton Transport</h3>
<p>Whether Price Reductions Will Actually Benefit Exports and Whether Merchants Are Willing to Purchase Domestic Products Are Also Questions</p>
<p>The Jinghu and Huning Railways Administration received a letter from Rong Zongjing requesting a reduction in freight rates for agricultural products such as wheat and cotton. They then submitted a request to the Ministry of Railways for instructions. The Ministry of Railways issued Instruction No. 8308: "Received your General Word No. 1521 of September 12, 1931. The Ministry has reduced the freight rates for agricultural products as much as possible in recent years, considering the impoverishment of the countryside. It has issued several orders to various railways to implement these reductions. Proposals have also been made at transportation conferences and joint transportation conferences. Regarding Rong Zongjing's request for a radical reduction in the freight rates for wheat and cotton by the Maoxin, Fuxin, and Shenxin General Companies, the railway has already inquired about it. It is feasible to conduct a detailed investigation of the production and sales of the various agricultural products for which the freight rate reduction is requested and then submit it to the Ministry for review. However, based on the past performance of various railways in reducing freight rates, it is doubtful whether reducing prices will actually benefit exports. Whether our country's ports and Shanghai merchants are willing to purchase domestic products is also a question. The prices of domestic raw materials are often higher and the quality is slightly lower, and they are mixed with mud, sand, and stones. It is also difficult to purchase them in large quantities, making it more difficult than purchasing imported goods. This has led to a sluggish domestic production and sales and the impoverishment of the rural economy. No matter how much freight rates are reduced or prices are lowered, there will be no market. This kind of phenomenon has become a serious domestic problem. If we do not find a way to remedy it, the harm will be immeasurable. Since the company is aware of this, it should pay close attention to it. In particular, the company itself should purchase raw materials from domestic sources as much as possible. Regarding the company's plan to purchase a certain number of tons of wheat and cotton in a certain location, when to transport it, and from which station to which station, what are the specific needs? If there are large purchases, and there are regular shipments every year or times when there is empty railway car availability, the railway should give as much assistance as possible. Please contact the company to discuss and implement the above specific measures. In addition, the railway should also take into account the direction of the railway's return empty cars and use this proposal to solve the problem of the railway's sluggish business. Please pay attention to this matter. This order."</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Approves Clarification of Stamp Tax Application</h3>
<p>Workers' Account Books and Folders Exempt from Stamps, Shipping Invoices Must Have Sufficient Stamps, Internal Documents Exempt from Stamps</p>
<p>Regarding questions about stamp tax, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce not only answered them at any time, but also submitted them to the Ministry for instructions. The Ministry approved and forwarded the information, and published the full text in the 9th issue of the Commercial Daily. Recently, it received Instruction No. 7298 from the Ministry of Finance: "Your telegram of August 30 has been received. The term (1) 'Workers' account books and folders used by workers to receive wages' refers to the books and folders issued by the factory to the workers so that they can receive their wages. It does not include the factory's own wage account books. If workers other than employees of the store also receive wages or remuneration from the store and the store issues books and folders for them to receive their wages, these books and folders can be handled in the same way. However, the store's own wage or remuneration account books should still be stamped in accordance with Article 11 of the tax rate table. (2) Although the distinction between shipping notes and shipping invoices is based on whether or not a transaction has been completed, only the shipping store and the customer know whether the goods have been sold and whether some of them have been returned. Since third parties cannot know this information, the shipping note, which lists the name, quantity, and value of the goods, is issued with the goods and is no different in nature from a shipping invoice. It should be stamped in accordance with the law to prevent taking advantage of loopholes. Article 5 of the Stamp Tax Law currently stipulates that documents subject to stamp tax should be stamped with stamp tax stamps upon delivery or use. Therefore, the stamps on this shipping note should be stamped at the time of issuance, based on the total amount listed on the note. (3) If the capital and business of a store's warehouse, manufacturing plant, distribution point, or branch are not independent, but are actually part of the same organization as the head office, the documents used for mutual notification that do not create external rights and obligations can be exempt from stamping. This has been previously approved and notified. As for restaurants and bars attached to department stores, if their capital and business are not independent from the company, the documents used for mutual notification that do not create external rights and obligations can be regarded as internal documents. Please be informed of this. This instruction."</p>
<h3>Foreign Merchants Refuse to Allow Inspection of Weights and Measures; Municipal Government Consults with Consuls of Various Countries</h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Weights and Measures Verification Office began inspecting the weights and measures of the entire city, the process has been progressing smoothly. However, many foreign stores do not accept this inspection, which is very difficult to deal with. The office believes that the weights and measures verification is based on the laws and regulations of our country, and foreign merchants residing in our country should accept this inspection in terms of both reason and law. There is no possibility of refusal. Therefore, it submitted a request to the Bureau of Social Affairs, which in turn submitted it to the Municipal Government for consultation. Yesterday, the office received instructions from the Bureau of Social Affairs, which has submitted the request to the Municipal Government to send letters to the consuls of various countries, instructing merchants of all countries to comply. The original order is as follows: "According to the instructions of the Municipal Government, this Bureau has received a letter from the Weights and Measures Verification Office regarding the implementation of inspections of weights and measures in foreign stores and requesting consultation. We have forwarded the letter and instructed you to comply. This order, etc. According to the investigation, this case was previously submitted to the Bureau by the office, and we forwarded it and issued instructions at the time. Now, according to the previous matter, we hereby order you to inform the office of this order. Director Wu Xingya."</p>

Therefore, in addition to appealing to all parties for donations, they specially invited Mei Lanfang, who recently returned from overseas, to perform on stage to aid disaster relief.

Such a pearl-studded masterpiece is hard to come by in Shanghai, and the grand occasion at that time will surely be lively again. Also, the group received 928 yuan from 13 households including Li Xinji and others from the Tianyiwei Main Factory, a funeral donation to aid disaster relief; received 320 yuan from 10 households including Dayoujin Distillery, a birthday donation from Lin Kanghou to aid disaster relief; received 10 yuan from Zhu Jinyu; Zhejiang Industrial Bank received 100 yuan on behalf of Lu Jianquan; China Goods Bank received 4 yuan on behalf of Mei Shaowansheng; Sun Gong Family Industry Association received 1,120 new clothes and trousers, 45 pieces of old clothes and trousers, and 73 old shoes, hats, scarves, etc. from 27 households.</p>
<h3>Liquidation of Minghua Bank; Request to Shanghai Chamber of Commerce for Reconciliation</h3>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Has Agreed to Accept; But Must Provide Complete Books and Records</p>
<p>Since Minghua Bank in this city announced its closure on May 23 of this year, Zhang Jiongbai, director and general manager of the bank, entrusted representatives to begin liquidating the bank's assets and debts. The Ministry of Finance also sent an supervisor. However, due to the economic downturn, the loans that had been made could not be recovered in a timely manner, resulting in a situation where the debts could not be paid off. Zhang Jiongbai, in accordance with Article 1, Paragraph 2 of the Bankruptcy Law, which came into effect on October 1, which stipulates that a debtor who stops payment is presumed to be unable to pay off debts, and Article 41 of the same law, which stipulates that a merchant who is unable to pay off debts may request reconciliation from the local chamber of commerce before filing a bankruptcy petition, provided that a petition for resolution has not been filed with the court, formally petitioned the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for reconciliation in accordance with the law. It is reported that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce stated that since the bank's main office is in Shanghai, it is in accordance with the law to request reconciliation, so there is no reason not to agree to it. However, in accordance with Article 7 of the same law, it is necessary to provide a truthful statement of assets, a list of creditors and debtors, and a guarantee to fulfill the proposed method of settlement, before it can be processed. A reply letter has been issued for your information.</p>

They sent a letter to the Hong Kong head office inquiring whether they would be liquidated soon, but have not received a reply.

<h3>Taxpayers' Association Sends Letter to Public Works Department Requesting Reassessment of Sino-French Pharmacy Rental Price</h3>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession sent a letter yesterday to Felipponne, the acting Secretary-General of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession. The letter stated: "Regarding the letter from Shanghai Sino-French Pharmacy Co., Ltd., stating that concerning the house tax matters of a property belonging to their pharmacy, although they have repeatedly requested your association to send a letter on their behalf to the Public Works Department for a fair reassessment, they have not yet received the department's assessment result. Unexpectedly, the department's tax office sent a letter today with an imposing tone, seemingly having not seen their previous letters requesting reassessment, which is quite surprising. We are hereby sending this special letter for your information, along with the original letter attached." Upon investigation, this association sent a letter to your acting Secretary-General on September 17, stating, "According to a letter from Shanghai Sino-French Pharmacy Co., Ltd., 'Regarding our company's rental assessment, as land and property values have generally declined recently, we requested your association to forward a letter to the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department for reassessment, which the department agreed to in a letter dated September 9, for which we are extremely grateful. As for how to determine the specific amount and method, our company has no preconceived notions and is willing to comply with whatever is deemed fair based on the fundamental law and general laws. The most important thing is that the burden on private individuals and the income of the public sector should both conform to the facts of social economics, without any bias or imbalance, so that the result will not be mutual difficulties and both sides will not perish together. We are accordingly requesting your association to forward a letter to the department for their consideration and handling, in the hope of maintaining public friendship.'" It is presumed that your acting Secretary-General has already notified the head of the tax office. As for resolving this case, it seems very easy to handle, because the company has no preconceived notions about the method of determining the rental amount, and only seeks what is deemed fair based on the fundamental law and general legal framework, in order to avoid the burden on private individuals and the income of the public sector violating the facts of social economics and causing bias or imbalance. Accordingly, we are sending this letter to request your acting Secretary-General to grant appropriate resolution. Respectfully addressed to Mr. Felipponne, Acting Secretary-General of the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department."</p>
<h3>Municipal Public Safety Bureau Extends Tea House Registration by One Month</h3>
<p>Grace period extended to the end of this month; those who exceed the deadline will be dealt with according to the police regulations.</p>
<p>According to the Da Gong She, Cai Jinjun, the director of the Municipal Public Safety Bureau, stated that due to the proliferation of tea houses in the city, with both good and bad mixed together, some even engaging in gambling and associating with bandits, while generally neglecting cleanliness and tidiness, harming social order and public health, which is not a trivial matter. Therefore, he drafted tea house management regulations and organized tea house registration. Since the start of registration on August 1st of this year, as of the end of September, 544 tea houses have been registered and qualified. The original deadline was the end of September. However, since there are approximately over two thousand tea houses in the city, and only a quarter have registered, strict crackdown would be inconvenient. In order to accommodate business difficulties and show leniency, the bureau has specially extended the registration period by one month. Those who fail to register after the deadline will be dealt with strictly in accordance with Article 33 of the police regulations. A directive was issued yesterday to all branch bureaus to instruct tea house owners in their respective jurisdictions to come to the bureau for registration within the month. The original directive stated: "The revised tea house management regulations of this city have been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and promulgation. It is now found that many tea houses have come to the bureau to apply for registration and licenses, but many have delayed registration. The deadline is set at the end of October. Those tea houses that fail to register after the deadline shall be dealt with according to regulations. In addition to separate orders, the branch bureau chief is hereby ordered to comply, instruct the subordinates to separately notify and inform, and not to delay, so as to avoid punishment. Sincerely, Director Cai Jinjun."</p>

<h3>Iranian Mirek Sues French Tram Company</h3>
<p>Judgment: Compensation for the Plaintiff's Losses</p>
<p>According to the Da Mei Evening News, Mirek, an Iranian (Persian), fell and was injured on May 4th when disembarking from a tram on Avenue Joffre because the iron gate was still open while the tram had already started moving. He sued the ticket seller in the Second Special District Court for dereliction of duty, because the bell was rung and the tram was started before the iron gate was closed. The court sentenced him to a fine of ten yuan. Mirek then filed a lawsuit with the French Consulate against the French Concession Tram Company, demanding compensation for losses. The defendant's lawyer argued that the company could not be held responsible without definite proof of negligence, and the judgment of the Chinese court could not be used to sue the French company. The presiding judge stated that since the person employed by the defendant had already received criminal punishment, the defendant could not evade responsibility, and therefore ruled that the French tram company should compensate the plaintiff for losses of 1,970 yuan.</p>

<h3>Rickshaw Guild Petitions Public Safety Bureau to Investigate and Punish Car Thieves</h3>
<p>The rickshaw industry guild believes that stealing cars for ransom is extremely harmful to rickshaw pullers, so it has established a "no-ransom" group. Car owners who pay five cents per car per month, if their car is stolen while the rickshaw puller is working and the investigation confirms it, will only be required to pay six yuan. If the car is recovered but the rubber tires have been removed, three yuan will be refunded. If all parts are complete, no payment will be required. All losses such as new tires and car rental fees will be compensated by the guild. As a result, for several months, the thieves who used to demand ransoms have almost disappeared, and the rickshaw pullers have benefited a lot. Recently, these thieves have been secretly active again, trying to disrupt this organization. The rickshaw guild has petitioned the Public Safety Bureau to investigate.</p>

<h3>Yuanyuan Farm Suddenly Declares Liquidation Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yuanyuan Farm Co., Ltd., located on the Great Western Road in this city, the largest dairy farm run by Chinese people, suddenly entrusted lawyers Qiu Hanping and Song Yunhui, and accountants Zhao Yaojing and Liu Konggui to announce liquidation yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Yuanyuan Farm, with a capital of 500,000 yuan, began operations in the summer of 1932. It was founded by He Lin and Yuan and was registered by the Ministry of Industry with a capital of 500,000 yuan. It raises the world's best dairy cows, with the aim of improving Chinese cattle breeds and producing condensed milk. The internal equipment, such as disinfection machines, cattle-making methods, mechanical milking, cattle hygiene, cold storage rooms, and chemical rooms, are all excellent and perfect, and nothing is unscientific. It produces and sells milk, milk essence, milk fat, and manufactures condensed milk daily, employing hundreds of workers. The scale of construction is grand and beautiful, and it can be called the leader of the dairy industry in Shanghai. Last year's business reached more than 10,000 yuan per month.</p>
<p>Reason for Liquidation: Since the farm was involved in litigation with Jin Cheng Bank, there have been increasing troubles and its business has plummeted, making it impossible to maintain. The shareholders' meeting on the 19th of last month decided to liquidate. However, the farm's cattle cannot be left without someone responsible for them for even a day. It is said that the liquidators have separately sought solutions and submitted them to the High Court for instructions. The farm has debts of over 500,000 yuan, but the company's assets are worth over 600,000 yuan. Outstanding debts from customers are also over 100,000 yuan, which can be used for clearing and offsetting.</p>
<h3>He Xirui Does Not Need to Be Transferred; Pays 400 Yuan Guarantee to Voluntarily Return to the Team</h3>

According to a telegram from the Nanchang Aviation Commission, He Xirui was arrested in Nanchang for a crime and was subsequently granted bail with two months of leave from July 10th to September 10th. Now, due to the expiration of the leave and failure to return to the team, a request for transfer is made. However, the leave slip found by the police on He's person clearly stated three months. Previously, the court instructed that the slip be examined for any forgery or alterations. The police have now sent the slip to Mei Yujun of the Public Works Department's verification office for examination, and the result is that there are no alterations. Therefore, He's leave has not expired and it should be instructed that the transfer not be made. However, Chen Guangyan, a representative from the Public Safety Bureau, still submitted the case, requesting the transfer. After He's lawyer presented his opinion, Judge Wu instructed He Xirui to pay a 400-yuan guarantee and voluntarily return to the team without the need for transfer.</p>

<h3>Animal Protection Society Holds Propaganda Rally Yesterday</h3>
<p>Chairman Ye Gongchuo reports on the significance of animal protection; Guan Jiongzhi and Tong Hangbai both deliver stern speeches; The entire city obeys the order to stop slaughtering for one day.</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 4th) was World Animal Day, the 101st anniversary. The Shanghai China Animal Protection Society held a propaganda rally to protect animals and solicit members at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce at Tianhou Palace Bridge at 1:00 PM. At the same time, major newspapers published special issues, city radio stations broadcast speeches on the significance of animal protection, all trams posted propaganda slogans, and the entire country complied with the central government's order to stop slaughtering for one day. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Venue Arrangement</p>
<p>The rally venue was located at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce at Tianhou Palace Bridge. The Party and national flags were crossed at the entrance, and a white cloth banner reading "China Animal Protection Society Animal Department and Propaganda Rally to Solicit Members" was hung high. Next to it was a large painting specially made by the society. Upon entering, the corridors on both sides and the four walls of the venue were filled with eye-catching animal protection slogans and paintings. The entrance to the auditorium was designated as a signing area, and the podium was located in the center. The same banner was hung on the podium, with a portrait of the Premier and the Party and national emblem above. A reporter's seat was set up below, with a record seat on the left and a band seat on the right. The rest were guest seats. The venue was maintained by members of the Buddhist Association's Boy Scout Service Corps and the Youth Association's Middle School Boy Scouts. The Longhua Orphanage band performed music at the venue. The arrangement was simple and solemn.</p>
<p>Participating Representatives</p>
<p>Attendees included: Chairman Ye Gongchuo, Director Kong Xiangxi (represented by Zeng Kezhai), Wang Xiaolai, Zhong Ketuo, Li Jingwei, Public Security Bureau Chief Cai Jinjun (represented by Dong Xianxiang), Health Bureau Chief Li Yanan (represented by Wang Junchang), Tong Hangbai from the Municipal Party Department, Rao Qiangsheng from the Social Bureau, Guan Jiongzhi and Zhao Puchu from the Chinese Buddhist Association, Master Taixu, Dharma Master Dabeizhai, Dharma Master Lalai from India and Ceylon, Miss Belle, representative of the Western Animal Protection Society, Qian Huafo, Huang Jingwan, Shen Tianxin, Chen Gang from the Postal Service Association, students from Renhui Elementary School, and over 600 guests from all walks of life.

<p>(Qichang's photo) Animal Protection Day Solicitation Meeting</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>After the opening ceremony and formal etiquette, Chairman Ye Gongchuo gave an opening speech: "Distinguished guests, fellow members, today is World Animal Day. Our society is taking this opportunity to raise national awareness of animal protection. The main purpose of World Animal Day is that humans should be kind to animals. Although animals' abilities are not as good as humans', humans should not abuse them as much as possible because of this. Over the past few decades, many philanthropists and scholars around the world have felt from academic and conceptual perspectives that animals cannot protect themselves and that humans should protect them. Therefore, various countries in the world have joint animal protection organizations. Our country has only had such organizations for two years. Although most people in society sympathize, there are also many who are indifferent. This is due to the general lack of in-depth understanding of animal protection among our compatriots. Over the past year, the number of people who sympathize with our society's purpose has gradually increased, and people sympathize and arouse social attention, understand the meaning of animal protection through attention, and the public opinion expresses enthusiasm sympathy. In addition to today's commemoration, we are also holding a membership solicitation meeting. Major newspapers are also strongly supporting us, and our society is deeply pleased. Moreover, the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Interior have responded to our society's request and issued a clear order to ban slaughter throughout the country for one day. This is not only the government's expression of sympathy and importance, but also assistance, which is especially fortunate. However, what our society should do has not been fully realized due to various difficulties. I hope that all enthusiastic people will work together to help our society complete its mission."</p>
<p>Guan Jiongzhi's Speech</p>
<p>Recently, many people feel that the world is now a world where people kill each other. The panic among human beings is getting worse every day. We ourselves do not have enough time, so how can we talk about protecting other animals? This statement seems very right, but it is actually wrong. We have at least two reasons to answer them: First, human beings are intelligent and capable animals. When they are oppressed by the environment, they can use their own strength to protect themselves. The intelligence and ability of other animals are much worse than that of human beings. When they are harmed by humans, they can only suffer in silence and cannot resist. Although animals have different levels of intelligence and ability, the value of life is the same. Therefore, these weak lives need human protection. Second, human beings' habit of harming animals is the main reason for cultivating human beings' mutual killing. It will definitely cause a bad outcome of world unrest. It is like a child who kills insects from an early age and will easily kill birds, cats, dogs, and even people when they grow up, without feeling surprised. Therefore, the fundamental way to seek human peace is to first transform human psychology. A few years ago, the chairman of the European Vegetarian Society said a sentence. He said, "If you want the world not to bleed, start with not bleeding from our dining table." This sentence is very meaningful. I think that people who are enthusiastic about world peace should not disagree with this fundamental method.</p>
<p>Report on the Society's Name</p>
<p>Next, Director Li Jingwei reported on the society's affairs. A. Organization: (1) Actively seek to strengthen strength and start soliciting members. (2) Plan to establish local branches. Two branches have been established in Xi'an and Chang'an in Shaanxi Province, and branches are being prepared in Peiping, Changsha, Suzhou, and other places. B. Propaganda: (1) In addition to holding propaganda rallies once a year, we have first obtained the consent of the Xinwen Bao to publish special issues of our society irregularly. Other newspapers are in contact. (2) This summer, we specially printed 10,000 animal protection text and picture fans and distributed them to all walks of life. (3) From April 8th to 13th this year, the association joined the Western Anti-Cruelty to Animals Association to hold Animal Protection Propaganda Week. C. Career: Prohibit the killing of draft cattle in various places. In addition, prohibit the killing of field frogs and stray dogs, and request the Executive Yuan to issue an order to ban slaughter throughout the country today.</p>
<p>Tong Hangbai's Speech</p>
<p>Next, Zhang Hangbai, a representative of the Municipal Party Department, gave a speech, saying: "Although the four words 'animal protection' seem to have been heard only in recent years, our country has long had the idea of ​​animal protection, that is, the principle of loyalty and forgiveness said by Confucius, and the spirit of benevolence said by Premier Sun. Animal protection is a moral issue in meaning and a human evolution issue in history. Why should we protect animals? Because humans love life and are afraid of death, and animals also love life and are afraid of death. Humans seek to prolong life, and so do animals. In terms of morality, humans love and protect themselves and extend this to animals. Mencius said, 'Sufficient kindness is enough to protect life.' Love for relatives and benevolence is one principle. From the perspective of human evolution, the way of life of human beings in the barbaric era in the past was struggle and killing. In today's civilized era of the 20th century, human beings' way of life should be rationally reformed. Although Animal Day originated in Europe and the United States, our country has long had this idea. In the future, we hope that there will be rational life and mutual love between human beings, and that this will be extended to animals." There were also speeches by Wang Junchang of the Health Bureau, Dharma Master Lalai, and Belle, representative of the Western Animal Protection Society, with different meanings and from different perspectives.</p>
<p>Guests' Speeches</p>
<p>Next, people from all walks of life gave speeches. Wang Xiaofan's speech said that humans are one of the animals and the spirit of all things, but people should not kill other animals because they are the spirit of all things. Therefore, protecting animals is a morality that humans should fulfill. If we can protect animals, there will be no killing in the world in the future. Ceylonese Dharma Master Nilai Dan's speech said that most of the members of the Animal Protection Association are Buddhists, which is what I like the most. In the teachings of various religions in the world, there is a common understanding of animal protection. Take Confucius, who is worshiped by the Chinese, for example, he also has many famous sayings about animal protection. We hope that the world can have practical measures for animal protection, and the happiness of human beings will be increased. Finally, Master Taixu gave a speech, saying that animal protection is extremely important in Buddhism. In Buddhist scriptures, animals are called sentient beings. The so-called sentient beings are creatures with emotions. All animals have the psychology of avoiding death and loving life, hating labor and loving leisure, so how can we impose on animals what we cannot bear ourselves? Therefore, I hope that all sectors of society can understand this situation and that all human beings will have the psychology of animal protection.</p>
<p>Zhong's Reply</p>
<p>Finally, Director Zhong Ketuo gave a speech, saying: "Today, we are honored to have Party and government officials send personnel to guide us, and guests from all walks of life come to participate. We are also honored and grateful to have Dharma Master Lalai, representative of the Buddhist Association of India and Ceylon, and Miss Belle, representative of the Western Animal Protection Society, come to guide us. Our association will continue to work with this purpose and hope that all parties will be enthusiastic and supportive and give us guidance at any time." Finally, the entire group took a group photo, and then began performing entertainment, including the Postal Workers' Union's national music performance, Renhui Elementary School's opera, and the songs and dances of Bai Hong and Li Mingjian of the Mingyue Opera Troupe, which were very wonderful and won a lot of applause. The meeting ended with music at 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>Citywide Slaughtering Ban</p>
<p>Yesterday was World Animal Day. In addition to the propaganda, major newspapers published special issues, various radio stations broadcast speeches, and various cinemas added lantern slides day and night to promote the meaning of Animal Day and animal protection. All slaughter companies and butchers in the Chinese area of ​​the city complied with the central government's order to stop slaughtering for one day. At the same time, the Public Works Department's Health Department in the concession used a written letter to earnestly advise slaughter companies and butchers in the concession to stop slaughtering. All parts of the country also complied with the order to stop slaughtering for one day.</p>

<p>Mr. Li Chaoying, the former Executive Committee Member and Training Minister of the Zhejiang Provincial Party, was sent to study in the United States by the Zhejiang  Provincial Government in the 19th year of the Republic (1930). He then studied economics at the University of London. He briefly  returned to China to attend the National Congress. After the meeting, he continued his studies abroad for a total of five years.

The university has approved its publication.  Only two students from the University of London were awarded doctorates in economics this year. Only  Li is of Chinese nationality.  Doctoral degrees from around the world are considered most difficult to obtain in England. This is the first time that a  Chinese student's dissertation has been approved for publication by the University of London.  Mr. Li has many friends in China, who have sent congratulatory letters and telegrams.

<h3>He Fu, Liquidator of American Oriental Bank,  Forbids the Destruction of Banknotes</h3>
<p>Approximately 2 Million Yuan</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury, approximately 2 million yuan in one-yuan, five-yuan, and ten-yuan banknotes of the American Oriental Bank, stored in the bank's vaults, have been  burned for the past four days. He Fu, the liquidator, has been using automobiles to  transport them to the Yangshupu  Road  gramophone record factory he manages, where they are placed in furnaces and destroyed. When  transporting the banknotes, armed Municipal Council police officers were stationed to protect He Fu,  preventing the banknotes from circulating outside and being  presented to the bank for  redemption. According to He Fu,  he does not know how many of the bank's banknotes are still in circulation. Since the bank's closure, claims for redemption have totaled less than 800 yuan. He Fu is still spending his days  signing checks for the repayment of deposits under fifty yuan. Once this sum of 42,000 yuan has been fully paid, the liquidation  office will move to the Great Eastern Building.</p>
<h3>Former Journalist of This Newspaper  Xie Fusheng Passes Away</h3>
<p>He Leaves Behind Two Sons and Three Daughters in Poverty  Chinese and Western Communities Mourn Upon Hearing the News</p>
<p>Mr. Xie Fusheng, a well-known translator, recently founded the English-language "Fu Sheng Times" and the Fu Sheng Commercial English Evening School at 505 Henan Road, Jin Xing Building in this city. He personally managed these ventures, which were highly praised by all sectors of society. Unexpectedly, Mr. Xie recently suffered from overwork and the adverse weather, leading to an acute case of typhoid fever. Despite medical treatment from both Chinese and Western doctors, he passed away yesterday afternoon at 2:10 PM at his residence at 43 Gao Fu Lane, Avenue Sainte-Marie in the French Concession. His remains have been transported to the Shanghai Funeral Parlor by his family and will be formally entombed today. Mr. Xie was not good at accumulating wealth, so his death leaves his family in dire poverty. He leaves behind a wife, two sons, and three daughters. The eldest son, Guanghan, assists with the newspaper business at home. The second son, Guangdui, is studying in Hong Kong. The third son is still young. The eldest daughter, Minzhen, also assists her father in running the newspaper. The second daughter stays at home to assist her mother with needlework. The youngest daughter is studying at the Taoist temple in Hong Kong. Mr. Xie was a native of Nanhai, Guangdong, but grew up in Shandong. His wife, Ms. Liu, is also a native of Guangdong, but grew up in Shanghai. The couple had a very close relationship and had ten children together, four of whom have already passed away, leaving only six survivors. Mr. Xie graduated from St. Francis Xavier's College with a deep understanding of English. He served as a reporter for the Che Bao and the Continental Daily News. When Sun Chuanfang was the Commander-in-Chief of the Five-Province Allied Army, the English-language Public Opinion Newspaper, founded by Mr. Xie, angered Sun Chuanfang due to its strong criticism. He was arrested and interrogated at the military headquarters by Li Baozhang (then the Garrison Commander of Shanghai and Wusong), nearly facing misfortune. Fortunately, through the efforts of Yu Qiaqing and others in Shanghai, he was saved from death, but remained in  prison for a long period. He was only able to regain his freedom after the National Revolutionary Army advanced north and Sun Chuanfang was defeated. Mr. Xie's lifelong ambition was to dedicate himself to the newspaper  industry. Therefore, he recently used his personal resources to found the English-language Fu Sheng Times and the Fu Sheng Commercial English Evening School. Just as he was about to realize his ambitions, he contracted a minor illness and suddenly passed away. Mr. Xie had many friends in Chinese and Western communities, and all were filled with sorrow and grief upon hearing this tragic news.</p>

<h3>Entomologist Discusses  Malaria Prevention in Minhang</h3>
<p>Using Suffocation Methods to Eradicate   Avoiding the Spread to Shanghai</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Department has  already issued warnings to citizens about the prevalence of malaria in  Minhang and other areas. A reporter from Datong News Agency, through the introduction of Mr. Zhang Jingou, Chief of the Plant Pest and Insect Group of the Commodity Inspection Bureau, interviewed an  entomologist who has special knowledge of mosquitoes.  He provided a detailed account of the prevention methods. A summary is provided below.</p>
<p>Characteristics of Anopheles Mosquitoes</p>
<p>The spread of malaria is due to the transmission of malarial parasites by Anopheles mosquitoes, which is well known. The morphology of Anopheles mosquitoes can be identified by the following features: the palps of both males and females are nearly equal to or exactly equal to the length of the proboscis. The proboscis extends forward in a straight line with the body axis. When resting, they often form an angle with the surface they are on. On a vertical wall, the angle is approximately thirty degrees. The wings have spots. They fly silently.</p>
<p>No Danger to This City</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of malaria in Minhang, people in this port have been deeply concerned about being infected. In fact, Anopheles mosquitoes are not good at flying. Usually, they do not fly more than one hundred yards. There have been no reports of Anopheles mosquitoes flying over one mile.  The distance between this port and Minhang is more than one mile. Knowing this, it is clear that this port will not be affected by the Anopheles mosquitoes from Minhang, and our health will not be harmed.</p>
<p>Prevention Methods</p>
<p>There are many methods of prevention. The most simple and easy to implement in rural environments is to scatter wood shavings, bran, or rice husk ash into various polluted waters. This can suffocate the Anopheles  larvae or mosquito larvae. It can also stop the mosquitoes from laying eggs. As for the treatment of malaria, the administration of quinine pills to kill the parasites is best.  Those who have not been infected and those who have been infected should pay attention to isolation, which is true for all common diseases and need not be reiterated.</p>
<h3>Absurd Deception by a Russian  One Yuan Can Be Transformed into Two Yuan</h3>
<p>Jiang Shuling Commits Suicide After Being Deceived into Debt  The Rogue Russian and Accomplices Have All Been Arrested</p>
<p>The Russian Yino Gendi Xuema Lafoma Lengshi, residing at No. 38, Lane 1025, Jing'an Temple Road, Shanghai West, does not engage in honest work but specializes in fraud for a living. Sun Shanpu, residing at No. 3, Rongqing Lane, Avenue Joffre, French Concession, acts as his accomplice. All Chinese nationals who are deceived by the Russian national are induced by Sun and his Guizhou friend, Ye Xiangsheng. Recently, the Russian used a trick that could turn one yuan  into two yuan to entice people, with Sun luring victims. Sun then instructed Ye to lure Jiang Shuling from Anhui to Sun's house on August 12. Jiang, initially unaware of the fraud, handed over 30 yuan in banknotes. When he returned the next day, they returned 45 yuan to him. In just one night, he made a 50% profit. Jiang was overjoyed and regretted not investing more capital. If not, wealth could be quickly attained. The group, seeing Jiang's intention, took the opportunity to  encourage him. Jiang agreed to raise more funds. He borrowed from all sides. Within three days, he went to the Russian's residence with a hundred yuan and handed over all his money. When he returned the next day, thinking he would easily get 150 yuan, the Russian initially used excuses to stall and then falsely claimed that the raw materials needed for the transformation had been used up and the money was used to purchase the materials. To get more he needed another eighty yuan. Otherwise, there would be no offspring. But Jiang was penniless. He could only  return dejectedly. Later, he repeatedly demanded repayment but was not repaid. The creditors were pressing him harder every day. With no way out, he went to the North Railway Station Hotel in the French Concession on September 3 and committed suicide by taking poison in a room. He left a letter to his uncle, Wang Ruixiang, stating the reason for his suicide. When the hotel owner discovered it, he immediately reported it to the police, who sent an ambulance to the hospital, but it was too late to save him. He died. It was immediately reported to the First Special District Local Court, which commissioned a prosecutor to inspect the body and ordered Ruixiang to prepare the coffin. At that time, Ye Xiangsheng was still unaware that Jiang had committed suicide out of anger. A few days ago, he even went to Jiang Ruixiang's house at No. 27, Fuqing Lane, Tiantong Road, to visit Shuling, only to learn that he had caused the disaster. Ye, feeling responsible for Jiang's death, volunteered to help find Sun. He then led detectives from the French Concession Police to arrest Sun Shanpu. They then apprehended the Russian. Under interrogation, it was discovered that the fraud took place in the Public Concession. The French Concession Police transferred all the suspects to the First Special District Local Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang interrogated them. Qian Xunjiu, the lawyer for the Shanghai Municipal Council, presented the case and requested that they be punished in accordance with Article 339 of the Criminal Code. When questioned, the defendants shifted responsibility to each other. However, they all confessed to the fact that the Russian had given Sun 30 yuan after obtaining the money, and Sun had then given Ye 10 yuan. The court stated that the case still required investigation and ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody for further interrogation at a later date.</p>
<h3>Gambling Den Cracked Down on Target Road</h3>
<p>Japanese Nationals Handed Over to Japanese Consulate for Trial  Jian Meisheng and Others Sentenced Separately</p>
<p>Recently, someone organized a huge gambling den at No. 45, Lane 150, Target Road, named Gongli Company. To avoid the attention of the police, they hung a sign for Dafengfa Real Estate Company at the entrance. Hundreds of gamblers were present every night. However, the operation was not well concealed and was detected by Chinese Detective Fan Defu and Detectives Feng Qishan, Xia Shutang, and Hu Lihe of the Hongkou Police Station. Yesterday afternoon at 4:20 PM, they cooperated with Western Detective Caulfield and others to carry out an arrest. At that time, the house was full of gamblers engrossed in  the game. After the detectives implemented the arrest, they apprehended the owner Jian Meisheng, Shen Guiyong, Shen Mingsan, and others. Accomplices Shen Songjing, Jin Huiquan, Liao Qingru, Wang Guihe, Li Songlin, Liu Haoshu, Wu Shexiang, and Japanese nationals Kai Tejia Kata and Qiao Kai Ma Tuo (transliteration) and twenty-three others.

All were taken to the police station. The two Japanese nationals were handed over to the Japanese Consulate for handling. The rest were handed over to the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Chiang Paulien, the police lawyer, filed charges of profiting from skimming and gathering to gamble. After Judge Liangce interrogated them one by one, he sentenced Zhou Meisheng, Shen Guishui, and Shen Mingsan to five months of imprisonment and a fine of 200 yuan each. The others were sentenced to two months of imprisonment or fined 10 yuan. All the gambling tools and money were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Two Men in Short Sleeves  Drive Away in a Car</h3>
<p>Stopped and Searched, Gun  Confiscated  Accomplices Arrested Again on Rue Tenant de la Tour</p>
<p>Western Constable No. 126 and Chinese Constable No. 3389 of the Jing'an Temple Police Station were inspecting pedestrians on Rue Tenant de la Tour at Route Haitong at 8:15 PM last night. At that time, a southern car, license plate number 12700, suddenly came speeding. Two men in short sleeves were sitting in the car. Seeing their suspicious appearance, they were ordered to stop for inspection. A Ningbo-brand pistol and 200 bullets were found on one of them. They were taken to the police station. After investigation by Chinese and Western detectives, it was learned that the two men were Peng Huaguo (who was carrying the gun) and Chen Renxing, both from Anhui. According to Peng, someone named Yang from Yangpu met them on an open space on Robison Road on September 30 and said that Li Shaoqing and Yao Guan wanted to buy a gun and asked them to  transport it. They agreed to be paid five yuan per gun. So, a short while ago, they received two guns and 200 bullets from the Jihe ship at the Jardine Matheson Wharf and hired a car to take them to the Annan Road market, where they were arrested. The detective took a statement and went to No. 96, Lane 1238, Rue du Maréchal Foch, and arrested Li Shaoqing. Together with a savings book of 300 yuan from the Yongfeng Bank, they were all taken to the police station and detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were handed over to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted Peng and Chen in accordance with Article 1887 of the Criminal Code.  The lawyer requested that Li Shaoqing be  remanded in custody and stated the case,  requesting a postponement for investigation on whether the defendants had committed any crimes. Judge Wu asked Peng and the other three a few questions and  ordered them to be detained for further interrogation in seven days.</p>

<h3>Ms. Xiang Solicits Shares to Open a Dance Hall  Contract Never Signed</h3>
<p>Avoided Meeting After Selling the Dance Hall  Huang Suxiu Sues Zhu Pangu</p>
<p>Huang Suxiu, a woman from Sichuan, 39 years old, resides on Avenue Haig in the French Concession. Her family circumstances are somewhat extravagant, but quite wealthy. She has extensive social contacts and many male friends. Zhu Pangu, who used to run the Far East Film Company at No. 39 Museum Road, admired her reputation and wanted to befriend her. So, he asked an acquaintance to introduce them. They hit it off at first sight. In April of this year, Zhu was in urgent need of funds. As his pockets were empty, he borrowed 1,000 yuan from Huang, and their association became even closer. Zhu then took the opportunity to suggest that since more and more people are fond of dancing, the dance industry is booming, and dance halls are springing up everywhere. Investors in this industry are all earning profits several times over. He encouraged Huang to invest and jointly create a dance hall. Huang readily agreed and immediately gave him 2,000 yuan. Together with the 1,000 yuan he had borrowed before, the total was 3,000 yuan, which was all used as capital. Zhu gave her a temporary share certificate and established the Xiaoyao Dance Hall on Xizang Road, starting the business. Although Huang is a woman, she is quite familiar with partnership procedures. She repeatedly asked Zhu to sign a partnership agreement to ensure mutual trust. However, Zhu kept delaying and refused to sign. Then, after one month of opening, he privately sold the dance hall without permission, embezzled the money, and avoided meeting Huang. The Far East Film Company he opened also moved without a trace in advance. Huang realized she had been deceived and hired a lawyer to file a criminal self-accusation against Zhu in the First Special District Local Court, requesting that he be tried in accordance with Article 339 and Article 342 of the Criminal Code and ordered to repay the 3,000 yuan of shares and interest at a rate of one percent per month. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Shi De heard the case in court. The defendant had already absconded, and the plaintiff was not present either. According to the plaintiff's agent lawyer, the defendant has no fixed address but actually resides in the Yangtze Hotel. However, his  bedroom changes every day, making it impossible to find him. The plaintiff is also aware that he goes to various dance halls to dance every night. It was found that a person with the surname Sun in the Xiaoyao Dance Hall has a close relationship with the defendant. Please send the summons to the person with the surname Sun, so that he can forward it, which may be more appropriate. The court then decided to postpone the hearing for further summons.</p>
<h3>Sun Zhongyi Sued for Abandonment by Concubine Case Continued</h3>
<p>Sun Expresses He Has Never Abandoned Her  Hopes Concubine Will Still Live With Him</p>
<p>Sun Zhongyi from Changshu, the owner of the Lao Huizhong Hotel in Mikejia Circle, was previously sued by his concubine Wang Yuying, hiring lawyer Zhang Li, in the First Special Court for abandonment.  The Special Court had heard the case twice, but because the defendant did not arrive, it was decided to postpone the hearing. The details have been reported in this newspaper. At 2:30 PM yesterday, another hearing was scheduled. The defendant Sun Zhongyi did not arrive at first. Judge Liu Yugui of Chun Cui briefly interrogated the plaintiff Wang Yuying and ordered to detain the defendant to the case for review. But shortly after, the defendant Sun Zhongyi and his defense lawyer Yu Chengxiu surrendered and reported to the court. Judge Liu then asked Sun Zhongyi why he was late. According to Sun, he was late because he misunderstood the time on the summons to be 3:00 PM. He also stated that he and the plaintiff Wang Yuying have known each other for many years. Their relationship has always been quite harmonious. They lived together at No. 46, Qinyuan Village, Xinza Road. In addition to all living expenses, which I paid, I also gave the plaintiff another 100 yuan for expenses per month. The plaintiff's younger brother held a wedding last time, and all the expenses were provided by me. Therefore, the treatment cannot be said to be unkind. Two years ago, the plaintiff suddenly carried away more than 20,000 yuan in cash and ran away on her own. Later, I entrusted lawyer Jin Yongli to find her and bring her back, without pursuing the past, and continued to live together. Just recently, I entrusted a friend to pay the plaintiff 300 yuan, and there was no abandonment. A month ago, the plaintiff often went to  Shanghai to  rent houses. When  returning to Shanghai, the plaintiff suddenly returned to Ningbo and lived with her mother in a house at No. 26, Bugao Lane, Avenue Albert, French Concession, and then filed a lawsuit. But I asked myself that I did not abandon the plaintiff. If the plaintiff can express that she still lives with me, I will give her another 100 yuan per month according to the previous method. Judge Liu verified the confession and ordered the case to be adjourned for a further hearing on the 12th morning. The defendant was allowed to cancel the arrest warrant.</p>
<h3>Yan Wangshi Sentenced for Inducing Women from Good Families into Prostitution</h3>
<p>Imprisonment for One Year and Fine of 100 Yuan</p>
<p>Yan Wangshi, a woman from Wuxi, also known as Wang Laoqi, 30 years old this year, lives at No. 20, Dingning Lane, Avenue Alag in the French Concession. There are six or seven prostitutes in her house. Every time the lights come on, she orders the prostitutes to go to Hanzhuang nearby to solicit customers for prostitution. The prostitution business is quite developed, earning as much as 1,000 to 2,000 yuan per month, which is considered one of the best in the prostitution industry. In the first few years, Laoqi bought a prostitute named Wang Xiaohong, who is from Wuzhen, Jiaxing, 18 years old this year. Because she was not good at welcoming guests, she was often beaten. Recently, the evening before last, Xiaohong was beaten severely again for a minor reason, with many scars on both arms. The screams were heartbreaking, causing the neighbors to be angry and speak out. They reported to the French Concession Police, who ordered detectives to go and bring Wangshi and Wang Xiaohong to the police station. Yesterday, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. First, police lawyer Huang Xizhen said that Yan Wangshi will not be prosecuted for the crime of injury because Wang Xiaohong does not want to pursue it. However, after investigation, Yan Wangshi had the intention of making a profit and inducing women from good families to commit adultery, which is a proven fact. She is prosecuted in accordance with Article 213 of the Criminal Code and requested to be sternly dealt with. Zhi Zhi Wang Xiaohong said, Jiaxing He, because her family was poor, she was sold to Wangshi by her brother in the first year to work as a maid, but she was immediately forced to become a prostitute. The income was handed over to Wangshi for registration in the ledger. If she did not get her way, she would be beaten, etc. When interrogated, Yan Wangshi claimed that Wang Xiaohong had been introduced by her sisters to rent a small house, and she volunteered to be a prostitute, and it was not forced by the woman. This time, she broke a pot, so she was slightly blamed. The rest of the confession was vague. Judge Qiu sentenced Yan Wangshi to one year of imprisonment and a fine of 100 yuan for intending to profit and inducing women from good families to commit adultery. Wang Xiaohong was fined five yuan for violating the regulations on private prostitution and sent to the Women and Children's Association for custody.</p>
<h3>Lin Yuting Sued for Abandonment by Wife</h3>
<p>The wife and concubine of Lin Yuting, a returning overseas student from the United States, lived in Shanghai. A few years ago, Lin died of illness. All the inheritance went to his wife Lin Chen and his sons Lin Huantang, Lin Ruobo, Lin Rudai, etc. Lin's beloved concubine, Lin Jiangsong, and the eldest wife were at odds. She rented a house in Puyili, Qiujiang Road, Zhabei. Because of the desperate situation, Lin Jiangsong once filed a lawsuit with the local court to request a division of property, but it was rejected because it did not meet the procedures. Now Lin Jiangsong has hired lawyer Li Ming again to file a lawsuit with the local court requesting an analysis of the inheritance. The main purpose of the lawsuit is that the defendant Lin Chen and others saw that her husband had died and bullied the plaintiff. Her mother lived in a western-style house and drove a car, forcing the plaintiff  out and not providing living expenses. For this reason, she requested that the husband's inheritance be allocated to her so that she could live. After receiving the complaint, the court summoned them. Yesterday afternoon at 1:30, Judge Feng opened the court for summons. The plaintiff Lin Jiangsong arrived at the court with lawyer Li Ming and stated  the situation. The judge got the confession and said that because the summons  to the defendant Lin Chen and others had not been delivered, because no one had received it, they had not arrived. You can investigate the defendant's exact address in detail for the purpose of summons. Attorney Li said that the content of this case is very clear and the defendants are obviously avoiding not seeing them. He requested that the summons be served by public announcement. The judge said, "We will check and instruct them later."  They were adjourned from the court.</p>
<h3>Falsely Establishing a Film Company to Collect Money</h3>
<p>Recruiting Old Employees to Swindle Security Deposits</p>
<p>Qian Yongsheng from Suzhou, 21 years old this year, falsely established a  Shengsheng Film Company office at No. 90, Hengmaoli, Baxianqiao in this spring in name. He advertised for recruiters. Shi Jinli from Shandong, Pi Hongmin from Sichuan, Huang  Ying, and Sun Weiqiu from Wuxi went to take the exam and paid security deposits of 60 yuan, 40 yuan, and 20 yuan. After more than half a year, no official company was established. When questioned, he kept procrastinating. At this point, they realized they had been cheated and reported to the French Concession Police. Detective Tao  Sheng and detective Yao Zubo went and arrested Qian. Yesterday, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. First, the police lawyer stated the defendant's fraud and said that the case still needs to be investigated. He requested a postponement. Judge Sun approved the postponement, and the defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Sentencing for Trafficking Red Pills</h3>
<p>Ruan A'er from Haimen, 45 years old, lives at No. 33, Lane 106, Avenue Lafayette in the French Concession. On October 29, he was carrying 16 packets of red pills, totaling 16,000 pills, when he was seen at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Amiral Bayle by Detective Mao Jinsheng, Detective Peng Zhengyou, and Chinese Constable No. 736. The stolen goods were confiscated and sent to the Second Special Court. After being instructed to reschedule for further review, he was brought in for further questioning yesterday. Ruan confessed that the red pill was bought from Zhou Xikun at No. 39, Baokang Lane, by A'Si, who is at large, and handed over to the people to be sent to a certain ship, intending to take them to Ningbo for sale. It is unknown where they have fled to now. The court concluded the debate, and court President Wang declared Ruan guilty of possessing and intending to traffic in smoking substitutes, sentenced him to one year of imprisonment, and confiscated the red pills in the case.</p>
<h3>Female Corpse in the Ditch in Zhoujiadu</h3>
<p>A female corpse, about 20 years old, was found in a ditch next to the Peidong Avenue road in the south of Zhoujiadu, Pudong yesterday morning. Her face was covered in blood, and there was a rope around her neck. She was wearing a blue cotton cheongsam with a loose perm, looking quite modern. Between the road next to the corpse and the small ditch, the blood was like an image of murder and the corpse was abandoned there. The villagers reported it to the Zhoujiadu Police Station, and the police station ordered Xiao Jisheng, the local official of the tenth and eleventh divisions, to report it to the local court for investigation. In the afternoon, Inspector Lei Binzhang and other inspection officers visited the site for examination.</p>
<h3>Republic Road Robbery Case</h3>
<p>Weng Bingji Robbed of Silver Dollars</p>
<p>Weng Bingji, a Ningbo native carpenter residing above the Xin Chi Bathhouse entrance on Republic Road near Yongxing Road in Zhabei, had previously collected sixty-one silver dollars in wages from the factory. This sum included five ten-dollar notes from the Central Bank and twelve silver dollars. He carried it home in his wallet and placed it in the dressing table drawer in his room. Unexpectedly, at around 11:00 AM, Weng went to work at the factory, leaving his wife alone at home. A robber, appearing to be in his twenties, wearing a short linen shirt and blue cloth trousers, came upstairs under the pretext of looking for "Xiao Agen." Seeing his suspicious demeanor, Weng's wife replied that no one of that name lived there. The robber then dragged Weng's wife into the room, saying, "Sister-in-law, please help me." He then opened the drawer and, seeing fifty dollars in banknotes and silver in the wallet, took it and put it in his pocket. There were also twelve silver dollars wrapped in paper. The robber took seven dollars and left five. He then dragged Weng's wife to a small room at the back, locked the door from the outside, and fled. By the time Weng's wife managed to open the door, the robber had disappeared.</p>
<h3>Xinmin Road Fire - Two Houses Destroyed, One Person Injured</h3>
<p>Around 6:00 PM the day before yesterday, a fire broke out at the home of Bian Zhengcai, a Taizhou native, at No. 35 Xinming Lane, near the intersection of Xinmin Road and Datong Road in Zhabei. Upon hearing of the fire, the local firefighting association rushed to the scene with a pumper cart to extinguish the flames. The fire was quickly put out, but not before it spread to No. 34, destroying a total of two houses. Bian Zhengcai was burned in the fire, and his clothes caught fire. He was taken to the hospital. His wife, Ms. Ruan, who worked at a silk factory, was arrested by the Xinzha branch of the police upon returning home and transferred to the main bureau. It was also reported that several other families living with the Bians had fled after the fire, and their whereabouts are currently unknown.</p>
<h3>Su Yuanliang Approved for Transfer to the Public Security Bureau</h3>
<p>A-Ju, the seventeen-year-old daughter of Yang Quangui, a native of Ningbo residing in Yangjiadu, Pudong, was abducted on September 22. After a fruitless search, the case was reported to the local Public Security Bureau. At noon the day before yesterday, Gao Wansheng, the leader of the city's Public Security Bureau detective team, discovered that Yang's daughter was being hidden by Su Yuanliang, a native of Jiangbei, at No. 14 Weixin Lane, Pingliang Road, in the Public Concession, where they were living as husband and wife. He then took the girl's father, Yang Quangui, to the Hongkou Police Station and requested their assistance in the arrest. The police chief dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to arrest Su, who was taken to the police station for detention. The girl was handed over to her father. Yesterday morning, Su was transferred to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Mr. Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, presented the case. Yang Quangui testified about the circumstances of his daughter's abduction. A-Ju testified that she met the defendant at the Outer Hongqiao and went with him to Weixin Lane, Pingliang Road, where they lived together for nine days. When questioned, the defendant's statements were evasive. The team leader, Gao, also gave an account of the incident and requested that the defendant be transferred. The lawyer agreed. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered that Su Yuanliang be handed over to officers from the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation and prosecution.</p>
<h3>Continued Treatment by Dr. Li Shaoguang</h3>
<p>Dr. Li Shaoguang, a Western-style mental therapist at No. 41 Huayuan Lane, Jin Shenfu Road, is renowned for his successful treatment of difficult and chronic ailments. For example, the wife of Mr. Li Shouyi, a judge at the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, suffered from severe pseudo-paralysis after a stroke. She was completely cured by Dr. Li, a miraculous feat. Recently, the wife of Judge Fan Tongyi of the same court suffered from a severe case of "Faran Feng" (likely a type of arthritis or rheumatism). She was treated by renowned Shanghai doctors such as Wang Zhongqi, but to no avail. She was bedridden and moaning in pain. After Dr. Li applied his unique mental therapy, within a day, the patient could move upon command. In an instant, the pain seemed to disappear. Upon rising from her sickbed, Mrs. Fan exclaimed that Dr. Li was a "divine man." Dr. Li holds consultations in the morning and makes house calls in the afternoon.</p>

<h3>Small Business Loans - Please Consult Lisin Accounting Firm for Guidance</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Loan Committee began issuing small loans, applications have been overwhelming. However, many small businesses are unfamiliar with completing the various loan application forms, resulting in frequent errors.

It has been reported that the demand for guidance remains high. To maintain order, a temporary registration system is being implemented for businesses requesting guidance.</p>
<h3>Lion Brand Beef and Chicken Broth in the International Storm</h3>
<p>The Lion Brand Beef and Chicken Broth, handled by the Huada Pharmacy in this city, is produced by the German Martha Pharmaceutical Factory using a new cold-pressing method. It is world-renowned for its effectiveness in increasing vitality, replenishing bone marrow, and strengthening the spleen. It is also effective in helping to quit smoking. It is especially suitable for consumption during the current season. It is a sacred product among tonics. The pharmacy, aware of the escalating international situation, has imported a large quantity from the German factory to meet market demand. However, consumers should pay attention when purchasing. Any product with "one lion, one character" or "two forces, one character" is not the genuine product. Only products with the three characters "Lion Brand" in sequence are genuine German products. The broth is sold at major companies and pharmacies in this city.</p>

<h3>Report on the Progress of Shanghai's First Literacy Schools</h3>
<p>— Wu Tiecheng</p>
<p>In order to eliminate illiteracy and improve cultural standards in this city, special literacy education has been promoted. After several discussions on the preparations and points to note before implementation, these items have been separately disclosed and explained in the Shanghai Literacy Education Committee's Compilation of Programs and Regulations and in the Shanghai Literacy Education Special Issue of the Educational Magazine, Volume 25, No. 8, published by the Commercial Press. Since the promotion began, the first session has been completed, and the second session began teaching on September 5. In order to review the past and promote the future, the following is a general description of the progress of the first underground session.</p>
<p>I. Teaching Situation</p>
<p>The first session of municipal literacy schools, excluding the rural areas where they were not held due to the busy farming season, consisted of 220 schools in 19 districts. The number of schools were as follows: Temple District Office School, 20 schools in the Yimiao District, 20 schools in the Zhonghua District, 20 schools in the Gaochang District, 20 schools in the Qiu Bao District, 21 schools in the Datong District, 15 schools in the Qi Mei District, 14 schools in the Fahua District, 10 schools in the Pusong District, 10 schools in the Yangjing District, 10 schools in the Yinxiang District, 2 schools in the Yangsi District, 1 school in the Pu District, No schools were held in Zhenru, and 6 schools in the Caojing District. All of the above schools started on July 1 and ended on August 31, for a total of two full months. The final examinations were held on September 2. Of these, Caojing and Jiangwan districts each closed schools due to factual relations, so the actual number of completed schools was 218. The 200 literacy school teachers who passed the examination and completed three weeks of training, and the 20 selected from the Jiangwan Wenmiao Two Experimental Areas, totaled 220. Each teacher strove to teach with a spirit of hard work and endurance. However, more than ten people who were found to be perfunctory and incompetent were dismissed. This is why literacy education emphasizes strict rewards and punishments. The total number of students enrolled at the beginning of the first week was 54,541, of which adults accounted for about two-thirds and children accounted for about one-third. Adults were taught for one hour a day and graduated in February. Children were taught for one hour a day and graduated in April. During the session, according to the regulations of the Municipal Literacy School Chapter, those who taught for two hours a day graduated in one month, accounting for more than nine-tenths of the students. Only two or three schools still taught for one hour a day and had to wait until the next session to graduate. Textbooks were divided into two types for children and adults. Children's classes used the abridged short-term primary school textbook compiled by the Ministry of Education, divided into two volumes, one volume every two months. Adult classes used the Citizen Literacy Reader compiled by the Municipal Literacy Education Committee, also divided into two volumes, one volume per month. The total number of books issued to adults and children in the first session was 469,500 (including books used by private literacy schools and educational service groups; there are also cases where books were received but not used up and have not yet been returned). The average number of classes per school was five (including one children's class) or four (including two children's classes). There were very few schools with only four adult classes. The average number of students per class was about 50. The total number of classes in the city was 1,014. Teachers in the first session did not take holidays, so 22 substitute affairs staff were set up, averaging one per ten schools. Due to the number of schools set up in each district in the first session, the number of staff allocated could not be one per district, so some districts had several staff members, or several districts shared one. The allocation was determined and each district had a table showing which school and which day the substitute teacher would be teaching, so that the teachers could be reassigned. However, there were also temporary allocations. The number of schools, classes, and enrolled students in each district are shown in the table below at the beginning of the session. However, two or three weeks after the start of classes, some students requested to join, and some requested to change the date, so the number of students in the table differs from the number of students in the final examination results.

<h3>Painless Quitting of Opium?</h3>
<p>— Dun Gen</p>
<p>People who quit opium are most afraid of pain. They initially took it up to avoid the pain of illness, and now they desperately want to quit, but their mouths cannot stand the pain: (1) the pain of old illnesses recurring, (2) the pain of new illnesses increasing (such as back pain, leg weakness, back spasms, stomach pain, abdominal pain, dry mouth, dry throat, liver fire, red eyes, tearing, runny nose, yawning, coughing, extreme sweating, hot flashes, nocturnal emission, diarrhea, insomnia, irritability, etc. caused by quitting opium), (3) doctors who are inexperienced, inconsiderate, use insufficient medication, or perform surgery awkwardly, especially injections and blister extraction.</p>
<p>There are too many speculative doctors in the market who all claim to offer "painless opium quitting." Unfortunately, the three words "painless opium" have been abused to the point of discrediting. Now, let's take blister extraction as an example: Since a certain general called a foreign doctor to use blister extraction injections to quit opium, it became fashionable in Shanghai for a time. All doctors touted blister extraction as fashionable and flaunted their skills. No matter how skillful they are, I'm afraid that "blister extraction" is not painless. I have a wealthy friend who went to a certain hospital to quit opium. He stayed in a first-class ward, and the doctor fawned on him. The doctor performed blister extraction for him, applying a medicine to his chest. After a day and a night, a large yellow blister formed. He said that he could hardly bear the pain during that day and night, just like the old method of mashing garlic and applying it to break the skin and cause blisters. The doctor comforted him, telling him to sleep peacefully and forget the pain. But how could he sleep or forget? When the blisters were fully formed, the yellow water was extracted with an empty needle and re-injected into the blood vessels. After two more painful extractions and injections, it was over. He still talked about it afterward with lingering pain. He also said that he still had cravings after the water extraction injection. As long as he drank less of the craving suppressant, he still felt weak until two months later, when the main ingredient of the suppressant was completely eliminated and he had eaten a lot of tonics, he finally succeeded. So I know that quitting opium requires a gradual reduction method. Water extraction injection is indeed a newly invented medical technique, but to be completely painless and to quit completely in three or four days without any other aids and never relapse, I'm afraid it's not something everyone can do. (Before egg yolk essence became popular, many people who used the water extraction injection method to quit opium also relied on tonic injections for at least a week to resist mental fatigue.) Today, I sincerely advise my fellow compatriots who are determined to quit opium that if you want a stable, safe, and painless method, you should still use the "gradual reduction" method while taking egg yolk essence as an aid. This method cannot be better! Because after taking egg yolk essence, you can reduce the amount of opium by two-tenths every four or five days. In the end, to be more stable, reduce from two-tenths to one-tenth, from one-tenth to five-hundredths, from five-hundredths to two and a half-hundredths, and from then on until you completely stop smoking (those who swallow bubbles, eat earth, or inject morphine can also use this reduction method). Although some people may feel physically weak, they can inject egg yolk essence for one or two weeks. The egg yolk essence injection is not very painful when injected, but it's like being bitten by a mosquito. However, the pain of water extraction injections is greater. Everyone! I am not a doctor and am not soliciting opium-quitting business. These words are honest, fair, and unbiased. Because I am considerate of the physical weakness, fear of pain, and preference for gradual quitting among my fellow opium-quitting compatriots, I am contributing these experiences. If you can start taking egg yolk essence and reducing your opium consumption today, you can still catch up with quitting within the year and avoid the lack of freedom of government-mandated opium quitting.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes about Opium</h3>
<p>— Jiang Deqi</p>
<p>Guo Jifen's Laughingstock</p>
<p>During the Qing Dynasty's Guangxu reign, Guo Jifen was awaiting assignment as a circuit intendant in Zhejiang. He once served as the director-general of the Wenzhou-Chu Salt and Tax Bureau. Because he collected less than the quota and owed arrears, he was impeached and dismissed. Zeng Zigu, the governor of Zhejiang, investigated and found that the shortfall was due to weather conditions and the arrears were due to manpower constraints. He deemed the situation justifiable and reinstated him. However, after only a year, Zeng impeached him again for opium use, and he was stripped of his post. When Guo entered the opium prohibition center for examination, he placed a large plaster on his anus. The plaster was opium paste, not medicine. According to custom, officials entering the examination center had to exchange all their clothing, shoes, socks, and even belts for government-owned items, from head to toe. When Guo changed his pants, the committee member saw the plaster on his anus and asked about it. Guo said that it was used to treat hemorrhoids. The committee member removed it and examined it, saying, "This looks like opium paste. It should be kept for examination." Guo strongly protested. The committee member had no choice but to let him keep it on, but closely monitored his movements. However, since the opium paste had been applied to hemorrhoids, it was too dirty to be ingested. The legal deadline was one week. On the second day, Guo could no longer bear it and begged the monitor to allow him to swallow opium pills, promising to keep the secret and offering a reward of ten thousand gold. The committee member reported the situation to the director-general. Guo's plan failed. He confessed to smoking opium and was released that day. The director-general reported to the governor, who, according to regulations, decided to strip him of his post.</p>
<p>The Xianfeng Emperor's Opium Addiction</p>
<p>During the Qing Dynasty's Xianfeng reign, the prohibition of opium gradually relaxed. Many high officials at that time were addicted to it. Even the emperor himself was fond of this substance. When the Anglo-French Allied Forces entered Beijing, the emperor fled north to Rehe. In addition to his fear and anxiety, his addiction kicked in, leading to a serious illness. At that time, the emperor was forced to flee because he had taken opium with him. The emperor was also angry that the Opium War had led to foreign troops invading. He deeply regretted succumbing to its poison, so he decided to quit. Unexpectedly, this led to his illness. Alas, the poison of opium is painful throughout the world, and even the emperor of the time destroyed his life with it. How painful it is!</p>
<p>Exquisite Couplets</p>
<p>My hometown scholar, Pan Kaisheng, was unrestrained in his literary talent and did not engage in farming. He was deeply addicted to opium. He once wrote two couplets that are still recited by the villagers as conversation starters. One reads: "When will the mouth blowing a flute without holes attract a phoenix?" "The hand holding a bald brush scribbles all day long." The other reads: "The lamplight is not as good as the starlight, but it can still shoot at the Big Dipper." "Foreign medicine is not the same as gunpowder, but it can also fire a gun."</p>
<h3>Occasional Opium Couplets</h3>
<p>— Er Xi</p>
<p>I enjoy collecting satirical couplets in my spare time. I have already collected many. I have now extracted a few that satirize the fun of smoking opium to share with my fellow literati to bring some joy.</p>
<p>(1) There is a couplet imitating the Yunnan Daguanlou couplet, satirizing opium smokers: "Five hundred taels of opium mud borrowed into the hand, cheap and pure, joyfully and endlessly. Look at Guangdong boasting black soil, Hubei valuing red gelatin, Guizhou valuing green mountains, Yunnan valuing white water, assessing the colors and distinguishing them, and inviting guests to comment leisurely. Taking advantage of the fire being strong and the stove being hot, the fish roe and crab eye are boiled, just dreading the long night, so arrange some snowy jade peaches to avoid wasting the four-sided censer, the ten thousand character incense tray, the nine-sectioned old gun, and the three-xiang jade mouthpiece. Thousands of taels of family property are forgotten, and the mind is exhausted, laughing at how useful endless wealth is. Think of the famous Bakhus, the precious Fushou, the Cheng-passed poppy, and the flower named hibiscus. Lying with a lit lamp, enjoying all the pleasures of life, just smoking morning and night, not afraid of the scorching sun and cold tides, even if the wife complains and the children cry, just pretend to be deaf and dumb, only leaving a few inches of prisoner hair, half a shoulder, two lines of tears, and a dry skeleton."</p>
<p>(2) There is a couplet that imitates the City God Temple couplet to create a couplet for opium dens: "No matter how lawless you are, when you get here, can you still be strong?" "You must know that I don't lend or owe, so put down your afraid guns and count the money quickly."</p>
<p>(3) A scholar had an opium addiction and once made a couplet to satirize himself: "One couch is laid out, never mind the earth cracking, the sky collapsing, the sea drying, and the stones rotting." "Half a lifetime is wasted, there will always be a day when the smoke dissipates, the fire goes out, the oil is exhausted, and the lamp dries up."</p>
<p>(4) There is a couplet satirizing those who set up lamps in ancestral halls to sell opium: "Breathing in sync with the ancestors is the true line of incense." "Laughing at descendants who haven't read poetry and books but know the lamps and fire at the third watch."</p>
<p>(5) There is a couplet created by collecting phrases for opium dens: "Heavy curtains don't roll up, leaving fragrance for a long time," "Short flute has no tune, blowing as you please."</p>
<p>(6) Another couplet satirizes smokers: "Without system, holding up the mourning stick early, before death, lighting the upside-down lamp first."</p>

<h3>The Evils of Opium (An Imitation of New Suzhou Ballads)</h3>
<p>— Yu Mengjiang</p>
<p>Speaking of opium, it's so harmful... Oh dear, it harms us common people, making us poor and weak, it's truly hateful! Ever since it spread until now, it's been the main reason for the nation's crisis! The Qing Dynasty produced Lin Zexu, who wanted to ban opium! He said that... If opium is prevalent for ten years, the country will have nowhere to find silver for the military, and if it spreads for a hundred years, the country will have no soldiers to use. Those hateful British people started a war, drawing swords and spears. We can only hate Empress Dowager Cixi and Li Hongzhang, who were weak, incompetent, and afraid of war, and could only cede territory and pay compensation, signing unequal treaties. This is the root of the disaster of national subjugation and annihilation. Think about whether you hate it or not... hate. (Passing through the door)</p>
<p>Some people say that it's okay for rich people to smoke... as long as they can afford some fake foreign snacks, fine paste, large soil, and white bronze lamps. When collecting the paste, they use ginseng, and beautiful wives and concubines serve them, exhaling clouds and spitting mist, turning into immortals. But once you enter this city of hibiscus, sweetness turns into bitterness later on. Spending two taels is a small matter, as weakness and illness follow one after another. Today they invite a doctor, tomorrow they need a morphine shot. They pick and choose doctors to do more business... (Passing through the door)</p>
<p>You must know that opium contains morphine, which can only temporarily excite you. For a while, it's truly like an immortal's joy, but over time, it will turn into a disease. You become confused and disoriented day and night, and constipation is extremely painful. My parents gave me this six-foot body, but I become disabled for life, which is truly pitiful. Perhaps all kinds of careers will collapse in an instant, or perhaps all the wealth will be swallowed in one gulp... (Passing through the door)</p>
<p>I insist on saying that it's even more pitiful for poor people to smoke... wasting time and losing their jobs, spending their days in vain. The ancients said: "An inch of time is worth an inch of gold, but an inch of gold cannot buy an inch of time!" Isn't it true that great times are wasted for a lifetime? Some suffer from great economic oppression, and their wives and children are separated, which is very heartbreaking. The whole family runs away, and relatives and friends don't recognize them. They can only go to the swallow's nest to be coolies. If they miss a dose for a day, their defenses are down, and they'll see King Yama from typhoid fever. After they die, they'll be buried in the countryside. Think about whether it's pitiful or not... pitiful. (Passing through the door)</p>
<p>Today, I advise you gentlemen and friends... whether you are poor, rich, or businessmen, in short, if you smoke opium, you should quit as soon as possible. Now there is a kind of "Kang Le Su" (Health and Happiness Element), formulated with scientific methods, containing lecithin, which is nutritious and warm. As long as you buy and take it for a month, I guarantee you'll quit and be at peace. From then on, all misfortunes will be eliminated, and you can live happily ever after...</p>

Also future owners. Essence and virtue. Transforming rain and spring breeze. Never. Smoke opium. Tarnish in the school. The ancients said. A gentleman's fault. Like a solar eclipse. Get central village. And educate. Its joy is harmonious.</p>
<p>Fifth exhortation. Deeply exhort soldiers. Secure the country and resist foreign aggression. The responsibility is heavy and unparalleled. Tiger head and ape arms, the appearance of being enfeoffed as a marquis. Never. Smoke opium. Destroy your own Great Wall. Hear the rooster and dance with the sword. Throw the pen and ask for a ribbon. To achieve meritorious service in foreign lands. Bronze pillars inscribed with merit. Rely on your head. And blood. Avenge the country. Drink the Yellow Dragon wine heartily. Sweep the cave and plow the courtyard.</p>
<p>Sixth exhortation. Gently exhort you honorable officials. Your position. How superior and honorable. Alert in advance. Observe afterwards. Secure the good and eliminate the violence. Sleepless and restless. The mouth does not speak of merit. People's hearts are like their faces. Each is different. Inevitably there are "hidden dragons" among them. I advise you to quickly leave the cave of smoke and mist. So that you can avoid. To be criticized by others. Attacked by ten thousand mouths.</p>
<p>Seventh exhortation. Sincerely exhort you scholar-officials. Learning is excellent. Ancient and modern are the same. Now officials are called servants. Four hundred million. Master. What are you waiting for. Bright and decisive. Benevolent and forgiving. Never. Smoke opium. Enter the wrong path. If you have it, change it, if you don't have it, encourage yourself. Suddenly repent. Naturally. Wash away the filth of the old dyes.</p>
<p>Eighth exhortation. Advise the rich. Now money. Known as omnipotent. Since it is called omnipotent. The path must be carefully considered. Why. Waste useful. Most of it is burned on the fire. This quickly quit opium. Save the poor. Plant blessings. Reap good fruits. Not a hair's breadth. Luxurious seats and thick shoes. How many lives have you cultivated? Hungry without food. Cold without clothes. The same is born of heaven. Ninth exhortation. Bitterly exhort the poor. I am a child. And you. The same is precarious. Seeking clothing and food. Already not easy. How can you smoke opium. Enter hell yourself. Resolve to quit addiction. Be determined not to waver. When misfortune reaches its limit, prosperity will come. The peeling and restoration omen is the first. Ancient and modern heroes. Many years out in the cold gate. Don't. Love black smoke. Endlessly fascinated.</p>
<p>Tenth exhortation. Universally exhort you compatriots. The painful history of opium. My clumsy pen can hardly describe. Hundreds of years of loss. Wonderful calculations are difficult to audit. Only fall to. People are poor and the country is weak. The wind and rain are swaying. The government decided on a major plan. Four years limited is not far. From now on. The pipe and stove will be extinguished and the smoke will disappear. Even more thanks to that. Doctor Tang. Invented "Kang Le Su". I wish you compatriots to ascend to "Kang Le". Enjoy the joy.</p>
<h3>Inscription for a Smoking Room</h3>
<p>— Ba Weng</p>
<p>The harm of opium is known to everyone. Now, imitating Liu Yuxi's "Inscription for a Humble Room," I jokingly wrote an "Inscription for a Smoking Room" to warn those who are addicted to opium.</p>
<p>The area is no longer large. Famous people come out. The paste is not much. It's not good if you don't come. This is a smoking room. Only without moral fragrance. Smoke smolders and fills the face with blackness. Poison runs through the whole body, turning it green. Talking and laughing are all smokers. No strong men come and go. Cover the food with egg yolk. Eliminate the cigarette lighter. No painful release of two. Restore the "Kang Le" body shape. Jump out of the black hell. Restore great light. The doctor said. What difficulty is there?</p>
<h3>Poem Modification</h3>
<p>— Shou Ju</p>
<p>There was a family in Taizhou with six or seven brothers who all had close relations with the poppy. Over the years, their essence and blood and the wealth of their family were all sucked dry by the poppy, turning them into nothing. I jokingly modified an ancient poem to sing about it: "Going two, three forward. Four, five opium lamps. Six, seven brothers. Eighty, ninety guns." (Note: The ancient poem is "Going two, three li. Four, five houses in the village ahead. Six, seven pavilions. Eighty, ninety flowers." It is a sentence from a red tracing book used by children to practice writing in the old days.)</p>
<h3>Important Announcement Regarding Kang Le Su</h3>
<p>Kang Le Su is a type packaged in glutinous rice hulls. (That is, the box is packed. Each box contains twenty pieces.) In the summer season. Because the climate is humid. As a result, the oil exudes outside the shell. When swallowing, it is held in the mouth with warm water. It is not easy to soften for a while. Distributors in various places are slightly careless in storage. Even moldy. Now it's better. The weather is dry. The shells are white and oil-free. It is easy to dissolve in water. Those who buy and take it all praise it. Inland areas willing to be distributors. Quickly come to purchase and promote it. Wealthy families. You can buy a few more boxes with confidence. Avoid the trouble of buying in small quantities. You can also get a bargain. Isn't that great?</p>

Jin Cheng's sprint is also outstanding. Deng Yinjiao's running and jumping have long been famous in the country. Ge Yulian's high jump of more than 1.30 meters is also commendable. It is a pity that the famous swimmers Chen Weishui and Yang Anni, the mermaid of the South Sea, who have repeatedly set national records, were unable to accompany them.

Their concept of the motherland is inherently weak. They can take this opportunity to return to the country to participate in the National Games. In terms of sports, they can mutually learn from each other. At the same time, they can gain considerable knowledge and understanding of the political, educational, economic, and social conditions of the country. Strengthen the sincerity of the overseas Chinese to the interior and increase the national thinking of overseas Chinese students. If the organizing committee of the National Games can give guidance and liaison, and other institutions, schools, and groups can provide convenience for visits, the number of participating athletes from Malaya is more than 130, and their enthusiasm for the motherland is commendable. If the team needs to visit various institutions and schools after arriving in Shanghai, it should be given special convenience to show preferential treatment. In addition to distributing it to the organizing committee of the National Games, we should ask you to check and handle it.' etc. We hereby order you to comply with and order your subordinates to comply with it.

<h3>Little Men (66)</h3>
<p>— Original work by Ms. Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>Of course, there were no classes that morning, and by the afternoon, the damaged room had been cleaned up, and the patient was better, so there was time to calmly listen to and try those little criminals. Ned and Tommy had explained their part in the wrongdoing, regretting that they had brought their beloved home and those inside it to the brink of danger. But Don was still in that nonchalant, "who cares?" mood and was unwilling to admit how much damage had been done.</p>
<p>Mr. Bae hated nothing more than drinking, gambling, and swearing; even smoking cigarettes, he had given up himself, so that the children would not imitate him. Therefore, he was filled with anger and sorrow to see the boys, whom he had repeatedly treated with patience, taking advantage of his absence to introduce these forbidden evils, making his pure children think that such indulgence was heroic and refreshing. He gathered the children and gave them a detailed lecture, finally saying with a firm yet sympathetic expression:</p>
<p>"I think Tommy has suffered enough pain, and the scar on his arm will make him remember for a long time not to get involved in these things again. Ned's panic is enough for him, because he has already regretted it, and he can indeed listen to my instructions. But you, Don, I have forgiven you several times, and it has been of no use to you. I cannot let my children be corrupted by your bad example, nor do I want my time to be wasted in vain, saying things that are not accepted, so you can say goodbye to everyone, and ask Nasui to pack your things in my black bag.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Zheng Yimei)</p>
<p>Climbing high on the Double Ninth Festival has been a routine story for nearly several thousand years. Indeed, during the Double Ninth Festival, the sky is clear and the air is crisp. Invite three close friends, and leisurely walk up the green hills in the suburbs. The red maple leaves and the yellow chrysanthemums, reflecting each other, are worth stopping for everywhere, and enjoyable to appreciate everywhere. Occasionally pick dogwood flowers and casually wear them. The fragrance of dogwood and chrysanthemums, permeating the clothes, almost makes one forget all the troubles and worries of the world. On the way back, pass by a country inn, boldly enter, and sit behind the window overlooking the flowing water. Drink lightly and slowly, talking about the past and present, without any restraint or taboo. Drink until the crows return in the setting sun, and the darkening sky begins to appear, then each returns home slightly drunk. It can truly be said to be enjoying life in a timely manner. However, the origin of climbing high on the Double Ninth Festival, as recorded in the "Sequel to the Harmonious Records of Qi," says: "Fei Changfang ordered Huan Jing to carry dogwood flowers in a bag on the ninth day of the ninth month and climb high to avoid misfortune." It can be seen that this day was not entirely a day for joyful celebration. It was not until later, when the governor brought wine, and Meng Jia's hat fell off, that the original intention was deviated from, and this was used as an opportunity for autumn outings and banquets.</p>
<p>Someone said: "This year's floods, from summer to autumn, have affected a wide area. The Yangtze River flooded first, and then the Yellow River breached its banks. Fields and houses have been completely submerged. There is simply no place to live on the flat ground. People have flocked to the hills and forests to barely survive. This kind of disguised climbing high is indeed to avoid disasters, and one can deeply sympathize with the ancient person Huan Jing."</p>
<p>The same climbing high, we are so carefree and happy. Those who are avoiding disasters, have no home to return to, no work to do, and are starving and freezing to death, are so miserable and painful. So, how should we show compassion and kindness, and generously donate to provide relief?</p>
<h3>The Hometown and Relics of Xi Shi</h3>
<p>— Sun Linchang</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Xi Shi was an ancient beauty, but some people only know that she was lent by the King of Yue to seduce Wu, and then her fate is unknown. One saying is that Fan Li carried her away together, but in fact, she died to save her mother. Now, I have received a report from my old friend Mr. Feng, and I am writing about the hometown and relics of Xi Shi below. Mr. Feng is a native of Zhuji, so he has firsthand knowledge, and his words should be true.</p>
<p>The hometown of Xi Shi is Luoluo Village, located outside the South Gate of Zhuji County along the right bank of the Huansha River. There is a small hill, and going straight to the right, there is a wooden archway with the four characters "Ancient Luoluo Village" written on it. This is the entrance to the Xi Shi Temple. The temple is a two-room, one-courtyard hall facing north and south. In the middle is a niche with statues of Xi Shi and two palace maids. The four characters above the niche read "Committed to Other Ambitions." The statue of Xi Shi is in the center, holding a book, standing gracefully, looking very lifelike. On the side of the temple is the South Hall, with the inscription "Place of Returning to Truth," next to it is a couplet: "Entrusting the body to live by the Huan River, declaring the ambition to die for the river, returning to the sky in one death. Being pure in the mountains, still unpolluted when coming out of the mountains." "Obeying orders to enter Wu, succeeding in the mission and retreating to Yue, serving the old mother in the Five Lakes. Being filial to one's parents and showing loyalty to the country." There are two couplets in the temple corridor, one of which reads: "Born in the home of Xi Shi's maternal family, loyal to the former master, filial to parents, she is an unparalleled woman in China." "Caring about the overall situation of the Eastern Zhou Dynasty, seducing the powerful Wu, reviving the remnant Yue, she is truly the greatest person in the world." The other one says: "Don't say that Su Xiao of Qiantang is a fellow villager, please tell about her above." "Just call Xi Shi of Huansha River a beauty, how can one convey the truth." Behind the temple on the right is a small pond, with a stele that reads "Rouge Pond." Outside the temple, overlooking the opposite stream, bamboo fences and thatched houses, with trees forming forests, this is Xizi Village. It is said to be the former residence of Xi Shi. Along the stream across Hengtang, there is a pavilion, called "Huansha Pavilion," which is the place where Xi Shi threw herself into the river to save her mother.</p>
<h3>The Origin of the Hairy Child</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>After reading the news in the third page of this newspaper on September 28, "Kuang Zhongmou Takes in a Hairy Child with Hair All Over His Body," driven by curiosity, I went to Penglai Market to visit Mr. Kuang. He kindly answered my questions about the process of taking in the child, which was more detailed than what was reported in the newspaper. Therefore, I am transcribing it below to supplement the deficiencies of the previous report. (The following is all from Mr. Kuang): The child was brought by magician Ma Shouyi when he performed at the Penglai Grand Theater in this market in August of this year. Mr. Ma has a long-standing reputation and has traveled extensively in Europe and the United States, with footprints all over the world. He has always been known as a strange talent, so everything he does is filled with strangeness. The child was born in Shaojiadaying, thirty miles north of Yingzhou, Anhui Province. His father's name is Shao Zhenquan, who is thirty years old this year, and his mother's name is Zhang, who is twenty-six years old. The family has been farming for generations, and the couple are simple and honest villagers. According to their own account, they had a son and a daughter. The son died young, and the daughter is already five years old. This child is the third child, born on the ninth day of the fifth lunar month last year, and is now fourteen full months old. At birth, there were no other abnormalities. The facial features and limbs were the same as ordinary people, and the physique was fat and radiant. The strange thing is that the skin is dark, the eyes are bright and shiny, and the whole body's hair is like a hedgehog, shining golden yellow. The hair on the face grows to several inches long, drooping like willow branches, incomparably soft, almost covering the face. The hair at the connection between the nostrils and the lips is particularly thick. The hair in the ear holes is even longer, fluffy like a tuft of hair, wrapped around the cheeks. The hair on the coccyx is dense and gradually forms the shape of a tail. This is only in terms of its external form. As for its special anomalies, one must visit in person to fully understand its bizarre and strange appearance, and sigh at the wonder of creatures in the world. When I (Mr. Kuang refers to himself) first saw the child, I thought it was made by artificial means. When I stroked his face, I realized that it was indeed natural. Because his hair grows on his cheeks, curly and shiny, resembling a lion, I temporarily named him "Lion-Shaped Hairy Little Man," which seems more accurate than the "Hairy Child" reported in the newspaper. I agreed to keep him in the Penglai Garden for public exhibition, for the appreciation and research of people from all walks of life. His parents are also protecting him by his side, and detailed inquiries can be made. However, the ignorant villagers believe that photography is ominous. Therefore, I have repeatedly tried to take photos to keep as a souvenir, but they have been rejected, and they said that if I want to take photos, I must guarantee that he will have no disasters or misfortunes, and no diseases within three years. The closed nature of the inland atmosphere can be seen from this. I hope that physiologists and eugenicists will personally visit, investigate and study, and publish the relationship between them, so that the strange is not separated from the proper, so that everyone's doubts can be relieved, and so that my good intention to take in the child will not be in vain.</p>
<h3>Black Shadows Enshrouding Europe</h3>
<h3>The Lost Records of Imperial Incense</h3>
<p>— By Princess Der Ling, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(Chapter Omitted) The Meeting of the Author and Translator</p>
<p>I casually asked if, after arriving in Peiping, you would be staying at the home of your younger sister, Mrs. Tang Binzhao! - Princess Rong - home. Unexpectedly, this sentence aroused her complaints. She said very indignantly:</p>
<p>"Rongling? We two don't get along! I can say that I have never corresponded with her, let alone stay at her house!"</p>
<p>This startled me. Sisters should be so close, and this older sister had been away from the country for so long. This time when they reunited, it should have been so happy! But unexpectedly, there was such a strange situation. From the look in her eyes, I could imagine that she would never talk to her sister after arriving in Peiping this time. I was a sincere friend, so I couldn't help but say many words to persuade her, and I also said how much her younger sister missed her. If she didn't object, I would be willing to send a telegram to ask Princess Rongling to meet her at the station.</p>
<p>"I don't want her to meet me!" Older people tend to be stubborn.</p>
<p>In fact, in "The Lost Records of Imperial Incense," she repeatedly mentioned "My Sister" and "Mysister," so she must have been very eager for this sister in her heart. It was because there may have been some misunderstanding at the beginning, so she was unwilling to soften her attitude. But as someone who doesn't have an older brother or a younger brother, I felt very sad.</p>
<p>Generally, when people talk about unpleasant events, it is difficult to continue the conversation. Moreover, seeing the look in her eyes, knowing that I had a good impression of Mrs. Tang, she suspected that I was on Mrs. Tang's side, so I could only force a smile and say nothing.</p>
<p>Because she was also someone who made a living by selling articles, we turned the conversation to talk about business matters. When she heard me say that every thousand words usually only sold for four, five, or six yuan, she smiled and said that that was only enough to buy jam. The value of her writing in the United States was calculated page by page with the bookstore owner after she finished writing a book, which was at least four or five times higher than ours.</p>
<p>The porters on the platform were shouting "Passengers seeing off the guests, please get off the train!" I asked her to sign her name on the back of my card. Unfortunately, she still signed in English. By the time I wanted to ask her to sign in Chinese, it was too late. I thought this was not important, and when she came back in two or three weeks, she could sign it again. What I was most concerned about was whether she could change her mind after arriving in Peiping and make peace with her sister (End).</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>Mother</h3>
<p>— Wu Yafei</p>
<p>Mother always coughed non-stop every night, and each time she coughed so hard, as if she couldn't catch her breath. It was really hard for me to hear. But after I repeatedly asked for her consent to ask a doctor to prescribe some medicine for her, I couldn't overcome her strong will. She often said to us:</p>
<p>"I can eat well, excrete well, and I'm not sick, so why see a doctor?" But she never finished more than two bowls of rice. Sometimes when she worked harder, she would even skip a meal or a day, which was common. But she wouldn't let go of her work, and she would still get up and do it.</p>
<p>"Mother, your constant coughing is very harmful to your body! Why don't you want to see a doctor?" This was my repeated plea after being rejected, but her fixed consciousness never wavered my sincere and passionate request.</p>
<p>"Coughing is an old illness, and seeing a doctor may not be effective. This illness was caused when I gave birth to you, and no one served me, so I went to the river to wash diapers and caught a cold. It's been almost decades now; what's the big deal about coughing..." Mother always explained the reason why she didn't want to take medicine in this way, but she just wanted to save us some money.</p>
<p>I had also tried several times to buy some tonics for her to eat, but she had been rejected by her stubbornness.</p>
<p>Mother was widowed early in life. There was no permanent property in the family, only three dilapidated yellow stone houses. There was no field, no land, only a few barren mountains. Moreover, when my father passed away, he left behind more than a thousand yuan of debt. The interest alone was one hundred and three yuan a year.</p>
<p>Debts had to be repaid, interest had to be paid, and me, my younger brother, and herself had to live. At this time, my younger brother was only four years old, and I was only nine years old. However, she didn't want us to be scavengers, so she sent both of us brothers to a village school to study. Where did this tuition fee come from? Did she not care? She had a strong will and a spirit of struggle. Therefore, she was not discouraged and never gave in, enduring the pain and struggling. She didn't need the help of relatives, and she didn't want to beg for help from clansmen. She only knew how to work hard, take the money she earned to pay off debts, provide for our lives, and give us education. Without complaints or sorrows, she believed that the future was full of light—only hoping that her two children would grow up, and everything would be fine, and everything could be solved, as long as we brothers worked hard and made progress.</p>
<p>Now, although ridicule, sarcasm, cruelty, and grief surrounded her, she was still very optimistic because us brothers were her only comfort. She often said to us in an encouraging tone:</p>
<p>"Children, study hard. Mom has worked so hard for you, hoping that you will make your dead grandmother and father proud. We don't need to be envious of those who have food and clothing. As long as you grow up, you will have everything." When she said this, her eyes were already a little wet, but she continued excitedly: "Because your grandmother was also widowed at the age of twenty-two, and only had your father. Now that your father has passed away so early, leaving you two children, this burden is on my shoulders..." Struggle</p>
<p>When we reached the age of fourteen, she had to ask people to help us find work. My body had been weak since I was a child, so I had to find something less strenuous. My younger brother was very strong, so it was no problem for him to work as a laborer. Before long, things were settled, so she was busy preparing bedding and luggage for us, and raising travel expenses, which was really painstaking.</p>
<p>After we finished our studies, because she saw that the dilapidated house was uninhabitable and very dangerous, she tried to build five new houses for us. She thought that with five houses, we two brothers would have enough to live in. But as soon as the new house was completed, she was anxious to have grandchildren, so she arranged my marriage. From then on, we owed more than two thousand yuan of debt. Moreover, with the recent rural bankruptcy, the debt only continued to increase. Therefore, she had to continue to work hard to help us. Because of this, she had to endure the wind and dew and run around even at this old age!</p>
<p>But what about us? It's a shame to say! I couldn't make her proud, and I increased her disappointment! Sorrow! Pain! Grief! Alas! This unfilial sin cannot be forgiven even if I am crushed to pieces!</p>

<h3>Little Western Heaven</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 20: Striving for Life, Watching Grandchildren, Crying and Remembering the Past, Planting Wheat and Inviting Disaster</p>
<p>The life of the poor is something that people with food cannot know. Naturally, the illness of the poor is something that people with food cannot understand. Li Shilian saw that Yueying's grandmother had fainted, and thought it was a terminal illness, which was greatly related to himself. The poor will do anything to get money. His family would definitely say that he had murdered her, so he should slip away before anyone from his family came out. This thought reminded him, and he immediately retracted his body and walked towards Little Western Heaven. His heart was also constantly thinking, "I'm here to visit relatives and ask about illnesses for someone's concubine, and now that I know the news, I naturally have to report it." However, if I really tell the truth, I'm afraid Yueying will cry, and he will want to go back even more. Secondly, I'm afraid he will blame me for not saving him when someone fainted at the door, and instead ran in. This question is not easy to answer. The more I thought about it, the more I felt it was right, and the slower the pace of walking became. When I was about to reach the house in front, he suddenly stopped and stood in the corner of the house, just staring blankly. Later, a waiter passed by him. Seeing him standing on the road, seemingly contemplating a trivial matter, he went in and said, "Eh! Mr. Li, did you lose something? What are you thinking about?"</p>

<h3>Finance Silver Prices Benefit Sellers; Margin Deposits Move in Opposite Direction</h3>
<h3>Repeatedly Breaching the 900 Yuan Barrier, Resulting in a Sharp Rise of 14.9 Yuan</h3>
<p>Recently, the gold market has defied expectations by rising instead of falling, causing increasing unease. Although international news and the silver market favored sellers, market sentiment has been strangely resistant to downward pressure, leading to a surge of buying interest and various rumors, ultimately breaking through the 900 Yuan mark. A major bullish investor emerged and then leveled off. The morning began with overseas silver markets showing gains in London and stability in New York. Large traders claimed that while U.S. buyers would continue to focus on near-term deliveries, there was limited demand for forward contracts. Forward silver prices in Montreux rose by varying amounts, from 4.5 to 5.5 points, while London gold rose by half a penny. Exchange rates slightly decreased. Although Italy and Abyssinia had begun their conflict, major players in the local market remained calm, and a lack of ample supply led to repeated rallies despite attempts to push prices lower. Retail investors were becoming increasingly uncertain, gradually improving sentiment. While pre-market trading opened lower at 81.5 Yuan due to large sales, advances by Heng Yu, Da De Cheng, Chun Yuan, Yong Ri Chang, Fu Xing Yong, and others lifted prices above 4 Yuan. The Central Bank announced its official rates, showing no change for British or U.S. currencies and no movement for the Customs Gold Unit. The standard gold margin price was set at 916.6 Yuan, a slight decrease. Trading opened with rising prices due to difficulties in settling exchange rates, but banks and Sassoon sold off to capitalize on the high prices, causing a temporary setback. Just as the situation seemed to stabilize, new rumors emerged, claiming that currency inflation and the issuance of Customs Gold Unit currency, backed by the Central Bank's gold reserves, were imminent. This sparked a sudden surge in buying interest. With demand exceeding supply, prices broke through the 900 Yuan mark, and the rally gained momentum. Banks took advantage of the high prices to sell, which briefly dampened activity before pushing prices back above 900 Yuan. Predictions that Indian silver would rise by nine annas were proven wrong as prices began to fall. However, buying interest remained strong, and the market stabilized by midday. Despite positive sentiment, the Hong Kong market's weakness and ample supplies limited upward movement. Indian silver was reported up five annas, with minimal impact. Buyers remained eager, creating unusual market conditions. Ultimately, the market remained volatile, with banks continuing to capitalize on high prices and Indian silver rising another four annas.</p>
<p>The morning opened at 883.9 Yuan, up 1.1 Yuan from the previous close. Da De Cheng, Fu Xing Yong, Yong Li, and Ri Chang Heng Yu immediately rose from 3.7 Yuan to 6.6 Yuan. Da De Cheng and Ying Xiang Hui Xiang sold off, dropping prices to 5 Yuan. Due to exchange rate difficulties, Yong Li and Fu Xing Yong advanced further to 6.7 Yuan. Da Da and Da De Cheng continued to sell, lowering prices to 5 Yuan. Pre-market indications showed that HSBC's rates would remain unchanged. Heng Yu, Hui Xiang, Wan Feng, Fu Xing, Yong Shen Feng, Da Da, and others advanced, rising to 8.8 Yuan. Da De Cheng and Fu Yu sold slightly, dropping prices to 7.3 Yuan. Da Da and Wan Feng again advanced to 8.6 Yuan. Citibank offered October U.S. dollars at 81.25, and Fu Xing Yong, Wan Xing, and Heng Yu sold off, dropping prices to 7.4 Yuan. Da De Cheng, Heng Yu, Wan Feng, Heng Chang, Yong Fu An, and others advanced, pushing prices back to 8.8 Yuan. Sassoon offered October sterling at 5.65. Chun Yuan Yong, Da De Cheng, Hui Xiang, Yuan Sheng Yong, Fu Xing Yong Heng Yu, and others continued to sell, dropping prices below 7.5 Yuan. Da De Cheng, Wan Feng, Da Da, Fu Yu, Yong Li, Shen Feng, and Chun Yuan Yong again advanced, driven by rumors of currency inflation, breaking through the 90 Yuan mark and rising to 4.8 Yuan. Fu Xing Yong, Da Da, and Hui Xiang took advantage of the high prices to sell, dropping prices to 3.3 Yuan. Unexpectedly, the Central Bank offered 420 bars of gold, and Fu Tai Heng, Ying Feng Heng, Heng Yu, Wan Feng, Da De Cheng, Fu Xing, Yong Fu Yu, and others advanced, fueled by reports that China would issue 200 million Customs Gold Unit notes, backed by the Central Bank's gold reserves. This pushed prices to 8.11 Yuan. Da De Cheng and Fu Xing Yong sold off at the high prices. JPMorgan Chase offered December sterling at 0.0625, dropping prices to 7 yuan. Heng Yu, Chun Yuan Yong, Wan Xing, Da De Cheng, Shen Feng, Da Fa Yong, Hui Xiang, Fu Yu, Feng Yong, and others bought heavily, breaking through the 900 Yuan mark and rising to 903.8 Yuan. Da De Cheng, Fu Xing Yong, Fu Yu, and Shui Li sold off at the high prices, dropping prices by 1 Yuan. Shen Heng Yu, Chun Yuan Yong, Qian Chang Xiang, and others continued to advance, rising to 3.8 Yuan. Banque Belge pour l'Etranger and HSBC offered November sterling at 1.125. Yong Li, Ying Xiang, Tong Fu, Hui Xiang, Chun Yuan Yong, Yuan Sheng Yong, Da Da, Fu Yong Qing Fa Yong, Heng Chang Yong, Heng Xing, and others successively sold off. Forecasts indicated that Indian silver would rise nine annas, dropping prices to 896.7 Yuan. Fu Yu, Fu Xing Yong, Ding Kang, and Da Da bought on the dip, raising prices to 8 Yuan. Yong Li, Fu Xing Yong, Hui Xiang, Da Fa Shui, and others sold off, dropping prices to 5 Yuan. However, Yuan Mao Yong, Hui Xiang, Fu Xing Yong, Yu Qing Yong, and others continued to buy, pushing prices back to 8.8 Yuan. The midday close was 898.5 Yuan. After the close, Fu Xing, Fu Yu, Heng Yu, Tong Yu Run, and others sold off, dropping prices below 7 Yuan. Heng Xing and others continued to advance and stabilize prices.</p>

Fu Xing Yong and Heng Xing advanced to above 8 Yuan. Initial reports indicated that Indian silver was up five annas, causing some fluctuation. Heng Chang Yong, Ri Chang, Fu Xing Yong, Da De Cheng, Ben Xiang, and Wan Feng advanced further, rising to 901.2 Yuan. Da De Cheng, Heng Yu, and Yi Feng Yong sold off at the high prices, dropping to 898.7 Yuan. Yuan Mao Yong, Wan Xing, and Shen Feng continued to buy, again rising to 901.2 Yuan.

Da Fa Yong, Heng Chang Yong, Chun Yuan Yong, Shen Feng Yong, Yong Li Heng Yu Qing Fa Yong, and others sold off, dropping to 5.5 Yuan. Li Chang Fu Xing Yong and Yuan Mao Yong continued to buy, rising to 7.8 Yuan. The close was 897.7 Yuan. After the close, Yong Li, Da Fa Yong, Yi Feng Yong, and Da Da advanced, rising to above 8 Yuan.</p>
<p>The settlement price, as indicated by the Central Bank's standard gold price, rose to 916.6 Yuan, approximately 19 Yuan above the closing price, a decrease of over 14 Yuan from the previous close. Account prices for this month were 894 Yuan, and 899 Yuan for November. The morning replenishment price was 894 Yuan, and the same for the afternoon. Refined gold was priced at 3 Yuan higher, at 886.9 Yuan. The spot market was stable, with Tianjin gold priced at 7.2 Yuan higher, with Da Feng Heng buying 350 taels. Refined gold was priced at 9 Yuan higher, but there were no transactions.</p>
<p>Market transactions were chaotic. In summary, Shen Feng Chun Yuan Yong, Tong Fu, Ri Chang, Huo De Cheng, Xiang Feng, Hong Xing, Fu Yu, Jing Fu, Fu An, Hui Yuan, Feng Chang, Yi Cheng, Li Chang, Yong Feng, and Wan Xing were on the buying side, while Da Da, Ren Fa Yong, Heng Chang Yong, Heng Yu, Yu Xin Xiang, Yuan Sheng Yong, Fu Shun Xiang, He Da Chang Xiang, Li Feng Fu, Tai Heng Qing Fa Yong, Wan Chang Yong, and Shun Mao were on the selling side. Heng Chang Yong, Qian Chang Xiang, Hui Xiang, Wan Feng, and Ding Kang bought first and sold later. Yuan Mao Yong, Fu Feng Yong, Tong Tai Chang, Da Fa Yong, Yi Feng Yong, and Heng Xing sold first and bought later.

Guang Bang Heng Xing bought over 200 contracts and sold over 100. Sheng Da also bought over 100 contracts.</p>
<p>The day's market was unusually active, opening at 883.9 Yuan and closing at 899.7 Yuan. The high for the morning session was 903.8 Yuan, and the low was 883.7 Yuan, a fluctuation of 20.01 Yuan. The result was a sharp rise of 14.9 Yuan from the previous close. Only 105 contracts remained for this month, excluding official contracts, with five long positions and two short positions. November positions totaled 17,808 contracts, with 43 long positions and 60 short positions.

<h3>Chinese Merchants Eagerly Acquire Foreign Exchange, Tightening the Market</h3>
<p>According to foreign dispatches yesterday, London's near and far rates both rose by 0.0625. Traders said that after the market close, the U.S. was buying near-term, but forward rates were showing signs of saturation. The New York silver market remained unchanged. Forward silver prices in Montreux rose by varying amounts, from 4.5 to 5.5 points, while London gold rose by half a penny. The U.S. dollar against the French franc decreased by half a point. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with near-term sterling at 1 shilling 6 and 75/100 pence and U.S. dollars at 38.25 Yuan, with sterling down 0.0625 and the U.S. dollar up 0.125 from the previous close. However, Chinese merchants were actively buying exchange, creating a situation with prices but no market, making settlements difficult. HSBC's initial rates were expected to fluctuate. Subsequently, rumors of currency inflation and the issuance of Customs Gold Unit notes spread, further fueling Chinese merchants' appetite. The Central Bank again intervened, leading to excess demand and tighter markets. Banks capitalized on the high prices to sell. Predictions that Indian silver would rise nine annas were proven wrong as prices stabilized. The Hong Kong market hardened in the afternoon, but banks sold off at the high prices, keeping prices stable. Initial reports indicated that Indian silver was up five annas, leading to disappointment. The market remained stable, but Sassoon and other Chinese merchants entered the market to buy, pushing prices higher. Banks continued to sell at the high prices, and the market soon eased. Indian silver rose another four annas, initially stirring sentiment, but the market hardened again. At the close, near-term sterling was selling at 1 shilling 6 and 5/10 pence and U.S. dollars at 37.6875 Yuan, with sterling up 0.1875 and the U.S. dollar up 0.4375 from the previous close. Chinese merchants bought approximately £50,000 in sterling and over $800,000 in U.S. dollars. A record of the day's transactions follows:</p>

<h3>Securities and Bonds Rebound Variously</h3>
<p>From 0.34 to 1.25 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Tea Merchants Securities Exchange saw a tense public bond market, with strong upward momentum. Buying interest in Issue 48 was particularly strong, and the situation appeared robust. The rebound came swiftly. Although the Italo-Abyssinian war had erupted, the UK seemed unlikely to join the conflict, suggesting a localized issue. Simultaneously, sharp increases in yarn, cotton, and flour prices fueled investor confidence, leading to a reversal in market prices and strong buying interest from various trade groups. This rebound had been anticipated by reporters. Initial trading was stable, with slight gains of 0.01 or 0.02 Yuan. Distant-term "Down with soldiers" bond rallied strongly, gaining half a Yuan. Issue 48 buyers showed strong demand for various bonds, further boosting upward momentum. The current month's "gold shortage" bond rose sharply by 0.8 Yuan. Subsequent trading saw strong gains for leading bonds, with "Down with Soldiers" bond surging 0.65 Yuan. Trailing bonds were weaker, but still gained between 0.02 and 0.04 Yuan. The afternoon opening saw heavy selling of Issues 11 and 16, causing a slight pullback of 0.01 to 0.035 Yuan. At the close, Issues 4, 48, and 69 continued to see buying interest, with the trend remaining strong. Prices rebounded from 0.01 to 0.04 Yuan. Given the complex environment and uncertain future, market prices generally rebounded, gaining between 0.34 and 1.25 Yuan. Total transaction volume was 19,725,000 Yuan. The gains and losses are summarized in the following table (unit: Yuan, transaction unit: 100 Yuan).</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Spot Yarn Rises Sharply by 3 Yuan, Futures Yarn Follows with a Rise of 1.1 Yuan</h3>
<p>The undeclared Italo-Abyssinian war strengthened investor confidence, and the recovery of public bonds boosted the power of the yarn market. Spot yarn transactions exceeded 2,000 bales, and market sentiment tightened. However, high prices could attract new short sellers, potentially restraining the upward momentum. Still, strong sales and dwindling inventories supported the stability of the yarn market.</p>
<p>Long Positions in Golden Rooster Continue to Increase</p>
<p>The pre-market opening of futures yarn was peaceful, due to a fall in U.S. cotton prices from selling in the South and profit-taking. The opening of Osaka's Three Grades Yarn was stable. In later trading, spot yarn sales continued to thrive, with strong investor confidence. Long positions increased, and uncovered short positions rushed to cover, turning the market bullish. Spot yarn shortages and price increases ranging from 1 to 3 Yuan made futures yarn increasingly attractive. The morning close was 1.4 Yuan higher than yesterday. At the afternoon opening, as market prices had risen sharply in recent days, profit-taking by long positions caused a slight pullback. In later trading, the trend was generally stable, with the result showing gains or losses of 0.01 to 0.04 Yuan compared to the morning close. In terms of sales, Dafu sold 800 bales, Tongji 1,200 bales, Hengyi 750 bales, Xinchang 1,950 bales, Hexing 850 bales, Gengfeng 800 bales, Tongfeng 400 bales, Renfeng 1,300 bales, Yichengchang 400 bales, Changfeng 300 bales,润康 2,650 bales, Hengchang 1,250 bales, Yongchang 750 bales, Yongda 1,050 bales, and Dachang 500 bales. Buyers included Quanfeng 2,400 bales, Daji 550 bales, Jinchang 1,450 bales, Zhenda 450 bales, Minghua 500 bales, 森康 1,200 bales, Changyu 800 bales, Shenji 800 bales, Yuanyi 900 bales, Taichang 1,300 bales, Dachang 1,450 bales, Tonghe 1,050 bales, Xinchengchang 600 bales, and Changfeng 2,650 bales.</p>
<p>Actual Sales Reached Over 2,000</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales were widespread, with strong demand in Guangdong, followed by Hunan province. Routes to Sichuan and Yunnan were also good. Total transactions were 2,355 bales, with prices rising 1 to 3 Yuan. Purchases by various regions were as follows: Guangdong 715, Yunnan 140, Inland 420, Industry 395, Changsha 220, Jiangxi 70, Shantou 145, Hankou 254, Now 200, Nanjing 5.</p>
<h3>Short Positions Rush to Cover, Cotton Prices Gradually Rise</h3>
<p>With seven consecutive days of rising cotton prices, short positions rushed to cover, driving the market straight upwards. Buying interest was even stronger than in the yarn market, and although spot cotton arrivals were abundant, sales were good. Investor sentiment was generally bullish. However, the financial difficulties had not eased, and few closed factories had reopened amidst this excitement. While new cotton for coarse yarns was selling well, there was still a large inventory of old cotton for fine yarns. The future of the cotton market was difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Zheng's Cotton Continues to Rise by Half a Yuan</p>
<p>The opening of pre-market cotton was moderate, as U.S. cotton fell by about 10 points due to selling in the South and profit-taking, and investor sentiment eased. In later trading, the yarn market strengthened, and short positions rushed to cover. Long positions increased, and market prices gradually rose. The third session was particularly active. At the close, due to some profit-taking by long positions, there was a pullback of 0.02 to 0.03. The afternoon close was 0.025 to 0.035 Yuan higher than yesterday's close. At the afternoon opening, the market continued to rise, with slightly stronger buying interest in the November, December, and January contracts. The upward momentum was strong. After the second session, the market eased. The result at the close was 0.05 to 0.25 Yuan higher than the morning close. In terms of sales, Dafu sold 900 loads, Tongfu 1,600 loads, Dafeng 1,400 loads, Yuanda 4,000 loads, Mingde 3,000 loads, Changji 1,500 loads, Shenchang 1,900 loads, Dafu 400 loads, Changyu 1,200 loads, Shenji 5,700 loads, Renfeng 1,200 loads, Yuanyi 4,400 loads, Hengchang 800 loads, Shengyuan 3,800 loads, Yongchang 3,000 loads, Yikang 1,800 loads, Xinheng 4,600 loads, Changhe 1,500 loads, Fuyuan 500 loads, Tongfeng 1,000 loads, Run Kang 900 loads, Xinchengchang 2,200 loads, and Yifeng 1,100 loads.

<h3>U.S. Cotton Falls Due to Profit-Taking by Long Positions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton opened with Liverpool prices strengthened by news of the European war. Foreign economic traders and Wall Street investors actively participated, with prices rising 2 to 15 points in all months. Later, large numbers of long positions took profits, Liverpool switched to selling, and Southern sellers hedged, causing market prices to pull back slightly. Buyers' confidence was partially offset by the recent sharp increase of 26 points, short positions in Indian cotton covering, and profit-taking by long positions. Later, due to war news, long positions bought in and prices rose. Pingguo Er rose 3 Robies, Aomula rose 3.5 Robies, and Bailuoxi rose 3.75 Robies. The original telegram record is on the left (3rd dispatch).</p>

<h3>Food Grains Futures Flour Price Rises Sharply - Future Market Increasingly Constrained by Margin Increases</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market opened with prices for all months continuing to surge. Foreign wheat prices were reported at 0.11 to 0.12 Yuan higher in Chicago and 0.08 to 0.10 Yuan higher in Canada. However, market sentiment was influenced by the formal outbreak of the Italo-Abyssinian war, raising concerns about potential price fluctuations. Furthermore, the sale of spot foreign wheat was expected to be suspended, leading to widespread excitement and active buying in all trading sessions. Half-day trading volume reached approximately one million bags, indicating the severity of the situation. While the afternoon opening remained strong, with distant months rising an additional 0.01 Yuan, the exchange imposed a doubling of margin requirements for all buying and selling activities, amounting to 500 Yuan per 1,000 bags. This constraint gradually calmed market sentiment, and trading was not as brisk as in the morning, with only over 100,000 bags traded. Future developments depend on the international situation.</p>

<h3>Futures Wheat in a Frenzied State</h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market opened with all months continuing to perform well. The opening price for the current month rose to 0.03 Yuan, up 0.07 Yuan from the previous day. However, due to weak buying interest and relatively small increases in foreign wheat prices, trading became scarce and the market calmed. Later in the afternoon, opening prices for all months looked good, with near-term prices up 0.01 to 0.02 Yuan from the morning. As the flour market calmed, prices gradually fell back, down 0.03 to 0.05 Yuan from the opening price. However, they remained 0.03 to 0.05 Yuan higher than the previous day's closing price. The current market conditions, driven by the East African issue, have entered a frenzied state, with little regard for domestic needs. Spot wheat prices were raised by a substantial 0.1 Yuan due to customer bargaining. 3,000 bags of Shandong Yaowan wheat, priced at 4.2 Yuan, were acquired by Fuxin.</p>

<h3>Shanghai South West New Rice Also Listed</h3>
<p>Rice Market Conditions Firm, Indica Rice Improves / Report of Food Shipment to Italy Awaits Confirmation</p>
<p>Yesterday in the South Market, the various sources of rice still arrived at about thirty-seven or thirty-eight (with a total of over seven thousand shih (石, a unit of dry measure)) and sales were balanced. There were no changes and no significant ups or downs in the wholesale prices. The low-grade japonica rice, with about seven or eight hundred packages from Yantai and Qingdao suppliers, maintained its original price. New goods like Baige (百哥) and kiln-grown rice also continued to receive over three hundred packages. Although the weather was sunny, the market remained stable. The supply and demand for both new Du Yangjian (杜洋尖) were harmonious and without any significant changes. Old rice was traded at an ordinary price. As for Changbang (常帮) rice, the southwest new rice was already on the market yesterday. The quality of the rice was considered good and plump, but it was said that the harvest this year was affected due to the abundant rainfall, yielding only about 70% of a normal harvest. The quantity of rice arriving on the market this time was not large, and it was sold at a premium of ten yuan and one dime (角, a tenth of a yuan) because it was the first batch of fresh rice.</p>
<p>Thirty-seven or thirty-eight sources of rice arrived in the North Market from the river. The market was weak in the early morning, with prices falling by one or two dimes. Later, due to news of firmer prices in the production areas, buyers disregarded the taxes and actively purchased, causing the white broken rice to recover slightly, rising by several fractions of a dime to nearly a dime. Dongxin (東新) japonica rice and Xinxin (西新) japonica rice rose by one or two dimes. The closing prices had already stabilized. Xin Yangjian (新羊尖) rice was stable, Xin Dufu Jian (新杜埠尖) rice was slightly under a dime, Baiyuan (白元) rice was weak, and Xin Kejian (新客尖) rice was slightly soft. Bo Dao (薄稻) rice rose by two dimes, and Shen Ding (審　) Baige (百哥) rice rose by two or three dimes. Other goods also saw an upward trend.</p>
<p>The rice market was firm. Small broken rice continued to be popular due to demand from local merchants, and prices continued to rise slightly. However, Saigon rice remained stable. There was talk of a transaction involving one thousand tons the day before. Because Italy and Abyssinia had started the war, there were rumors that the price in the production area would rise. As a result, merchants in the market held back their goods and did not sell. Yesterday, only one thousand packages of small broken rice and over two hundred packages of Saigon rice were sold, all through local merchants.</p>
<p>The supply of Indica rice was still active, with rice from Ningbo (甬江) being the most abundant. Rice from Jiangxi, Nanjing, Anqing, and Tingbei (汀北) also continued to arrive. The newly arrived rice was all purchased by local merchants. There was still a tendency for prices to rise in the future market. Due to excessive price increases the day before, Jianghu white rice (江湖白米) recovered by one dime yesterday. Other rice varieties also rose slightly by a few fractions of a dime. Throughout the day, three hundred and thirty-nine packages of Jiangxi machine-milled early rice, one thousand two hundred and forty-six packages of Ningbo rice, three hundred and five packages of Jingxian rice, three hundred and thirty packages of Anqing rice, and two hundred packages of Jiangbei rice were all purchased by local merchants.</p>
<p>Following the outbreak of the war between Italy and Abyssinia, it was rumored yesterday that one hundred tons of food would be shipped to Italy on the Italian ship "Controtto" (康脫羅號). According to this newspaper's sources, it seems that about one hundred tons of food is intended to be loaded on the "Controfanin" (康脫范因號), which is scheduled to depart on the ninth of the month. It is rumored that the ship is carrying a large amount of cargo, and whether it will be able to depart and whether it will actually go to Italy remains to be confirmed.</p>
<h3>Oil Market / Cottonseed Oil Sales Active</h3>
<p>Cottonseed oil sales were active, and the price of soybean oil soared. Yesterday, refined oil was sold at 2,000 dan (擔, a unit of weight), with the price rising sharply to 13 yuan and three dimes. Manufacturers, aware of the shortage of stock, were reluctant to sell and expected prices to rise further. Sesame oil was silent. There had been no formal market activity since last month. In the production areas, due to the rising cost of raw materials, it was no longer possible to transport goods for sale. It was found that the stock in this city was also limited, and the owners were not in a hurry to sell, so prices remained high for a long time. With the outbreak of the war between Italy and Abyssinia, the market for foreign sesame was active and the prices were rising gradually. Sales of Detong oil (得能油) in Shanghai were active, and the price rose easily. Although Bengbu oil (蚌埠油) opened at fifteen yuan and eight dimes yesterday, only about ten or eight dan were traded, and it was not easy to quickly recover.</p>
<h3>Soybean Oil Soars</h3>
<p>Due to the high price of raw materials, the thinness of the reserve in this city, and a unanimous positive outlook, the price of soybean oil soared. Although it fluctuated once, merchants from inland river ports such as Wuxi and Changzhou came to purchase, and the situation once again soared. At the opening of the market yesterday, the price jumped by eight or nine dimes. Under the rapid increase, it would not be surprising if the market today softens due to the influence of telegraph. Peanut oil increased by fifty cents. A total of more than 1,250 pieces of various kinds of soybean oil and 500 pieces of various kinds of peanut oil were sold through the customs.</p>

<h3>Electronic Alarm</h3>
<p>— Zhong Xu</p>
<p>(Electronic Alarm)</p>
<p>This device is made of a few simple parts and is a very interesting game. It can be used to prevent people from approaching an area, causing a bell to ring or a warning light to turn on. It can also be used to prevent fires and report rain.</p>
<p>The search wire can be connected in two ways: connected to point X is more stable and does not have the problem of radiating radio waves. Connecting to point Y is more sensitive.</p>
<p>(1) Connected to point X First, adjust the absorption circuit L1C1 to the same wavelength as the oscillation circuit LC. Move L very far away, and the regeneration circuit will start to oscillate. Connect a 10-10MA ammeter in series at point X in the diagram. At this time, the screen current is approximately four thousandths of an ampere. Then move L1 closer to L, increasing the coupling degree. The original oscillation of LC decreases. The tighter the coupling, the weaker the oscillation, until it is completely extinguished. At this time, the screen current is approximately seven thousandths of an ampere. Therefore, oscillation does not normally occur, and there is no interference from radiated radio waves. If the search wire is wound around the room (assuming a room is being secured), if someone approaches, the capacitance between the search wire and the ground will increase. The wavelength in the absorption circuit will naturally increase, and the absorption will decrease, causing the regeneration circuit to oscillate again, and the screen current will return to four thousandths of an ampere. This change can cause the relay to open and close, and connecting a light or alarm bell to the relay output point will trigger an alarm.</p>
<p>(2) Connected to point Y Adjust the regeneration circuit to a wavelength slightly shorter than the absorption circuit. Although the coupling between the two circuits is very tight, oscillation still occurs normally. When the search wire is affected, the regeneration circuit increases the wavelength, matching the absorption circuit, and the oscillation stops, causing the screen current to change and trigger the alarm.</p>
<p>If you want to use it to report rain, simply place a pole outside the window with a metal plate on top, and another plate on top of that, insulated with Bakelite. One plate is grounded, and the other is connected to point X or Y. When it rains, the capacitance increases and triggers the device. To use it to prevent fire, use a water thermometer, with one end wrapped in tin foil up to 70 degrees Fahrenheit and the other end wrapped in tin foil from 900 degrees Fahrenheit to the top. The lower end is grounded, and the upper end is connected to point X or Y. When a fire starts, the temperature rises, and the mercury column rises, increasing the capacitance between the two pieces of tin foil and triggering the device. It can also be used in other places, as long as it is legal.</p>
<p>The following parts are used:</p>
<p>LL1 18-gauge double-layer silk-covered wire, wound 10 turns on a 2-inch diameter Bakelite form.</p>
<p>L2 30-gauge lacquered wire wound 4 turns on a tube, with a distance of 1/2 inch from the L end.</p>

<h3>Electric Organ</h3>
<p>— Yong Yan</p>
<p>Although the structure of current organs is already sophisticated, there are still various shortcomings in practice. For example, the sound does not play immediately after the key is pressed, the volume is too small, there are too few types of timbres (ToneClolr), the range of volume change is too small, and smooth control is not possible. All these have long been desired to be solved but cannot.</p>
<p>The "Electric Organ" completely uses the principle of electricity, so the sound can be played immediately after the key is pressed, and the accuracy and beauty of the sound are completely unmatched by ordinary organs. Moreover, it uses a sound frequency amplifier, so the sound can be arbitrarily amplified to various degrees, and at the same time has extremely smooth volume control.</p>
<p>See the attached diagram for the sound generation principle of this electric organ. The "tone plate" in the diagram is connected to a synchronous motor and rotates at a constant speed. The plate has several protrusions. When these protrusions pass by the electromagnet next to it, the magnetic lines of force change. At this time, the coil on the electromagnet is induced to generate a sound frequency voltage of equal frequency. This sound frequency voltage is amplified and can drive the speaker to generate sound. This sound-generating organization is shared by 91 groups in the whole machine to generate various kinds of different timbres. The external shape of the electric organ is the same as that of the ordinary organ, and the playing method is also the same as that of the ordinary organ.</p>
<h3>Eliminating the shortcomings of regenerative radios</h3>
<p>— Juan</p>
<p>The regenerative radio that we usually call is a device that feeds back a part of the high-frequency current in the plate circuit of the detection vacuum tube to the grid circuit through a regenerative coil to increase the amplification. If this method is not handled properly and the degree of regeneration is exceeded, it will interfere with other people's radio reception and make the sound quality worse. This is a well-known phenomenon, but this shortcoming is not without a way to eliminate it. Now I will introduce a method to eliminate it:</p>
<p>The elimination method is to use another so-called inverse regeneration coil and a series of variable capacitors, and apply appropriate adjustments to remove the excessive effect of regeneration.</p>
<p>The attached diagram (1) is the detection vacuum tube of the regenerative radio, (2) is the plate circuit, (3) is the cathode circuit, and a fixed capacitor (4), a variable capacitor (5), and a common regenerative coil (6) are arranged between the plate and cathode circuits. In addition, an inverse regeneration coil (7) with the opposite excitation direction and a measuring capacitor are added in parallel with it.</p>

<h3>After reading "A Collection of Studies on Chinese Field Systems"</h3>
<p>— Ge Man</p>
<p>In the twenty-fifth issue of the Publishing World, I saw Mr. Zeng Jianping's reading of "A Collection of Studies on Chinese Field Systems." I read it carefully and learned that Mr. Zeng Jianping spent a full ninety cents to buy a new book "A Collection of Studies on Chinese Field Systems" written by Mr. Chen Boying, published by the Commercial Press. After reading this book, he cried bitterly and said, "I can only feel the pain in my heart," because the citations, structure, and conclusions in this book are plagiarized from Mr. Chen Dengyuan's book "Chinese Land System," and it is used as a blueprint.</p>
<p>I have not read these two books, but I do know something about the authors of the two books. It turns out that Mr. Chen Boying and Mr. Chen Dengyuan are both from Zhouxing Town in Yuyao. Because they teach in universities in Nanjing, they are, of course, "extraordinary" people in our Yuyao. In conversations between friends, they often mention these two gentlemen. I seem to have heard that Mr. Chen Boying teaches in universities in Nanjing and has written books on Chinese land issues; Mr. Chen Dengyuan also teaches in universities in Nanjing and has also written books on Chinese land issues. At that time, I had some speculation that there are many Chinese names, perhaps Mr. Chen Boying knew that Mr. Chen Dengyuan was "two in one"? Now that I have read Mr. Zeng's article, I asked my friend and learned that my guess was correct.</p>
<p>Therefore, I feel that today's writers and publishers only aim to seek harmony and ignore the mission of promoting culture. According to Mr. Zeng's article, "Chen Dengyuan's work was published in 1932, while Chen Boying's work was only published this year... Those who are knowledgeable may have the same opinions, but they cannot even have the same references and conclusions. Moreover, not only one chapter is the same, but other sections are also mostly the same." From this point of view, Mr. Chen Dengyuan has no new opinions and insights to contribute since 1932; he just changed his appearance, changed some content, and published another book; but the preface says: "The collection of studies on field systems is the result of my historical research in the past two or three years." In this way, what is the purpose of publishing Jia's collection of studies on field systems? It is very obvious.</p>
<p>I hope that writers and publishers will look at the backward Chinese culture and listen to the cry of "I can only feel the pain in my heart."</p>
<h3>On Small Newspapers</h3>
<p>— Xu Lu</p>
<p>There is a noteworthy phenomenon in the recent publishing world: the rise of small newspapers. Dozens of small newspapers have sprung up one after another; and judging from the situation, they will probably become more prosperous and more numerous in the future.</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, this seems to be a gratifying phenomenon; China's newspapers are not as numerous as those in the West, not to mention the West, but even Japan. Newspapers are the best weapon for public education—their importance is not limited to conveying news; now that they can gradually increase, it also strengthens the power of public education. Naturally, it is extremely gratifying.</p>
<p>But in more detail, whether or not there is an effect in running any kind of cultural enterprise is not just a matter of quantity. It is not enough to say that more is good, it should also have substantial quality. Quality and quantity should be equally important; for example, in the case of newspapers, if the quality is good but the quantity is not large, its power is certainly limited; if the quantity is large but the quality is not good, then not only will there be no effect, but it may even become a toxin, because its quantity is large and it is more widely distributed to the minds of the public, achieving the opposite effect of the newspaper's original meaning.</p>
<p>Therefore, when we see the vigorous rise of small newspapers, we cannot simply congratulate the publishing world for this, but we should also look at the substance of these newspapers with a solemn eye.</p>
<p>The power of so-called "small newspapers" in Shanghai (in fact, in the entire province of Jiangsu) is known to everyone. The number of readers and the good sales are really no less than those of large newspapers. The general literate public, except for a small number of students and the upper intellectual class, everyone would rather read small newspapers than large newspapers. What is the reason for this? After investigation, there are probably the following reasons:</p>
<p>1. Because small newspapers are cheap. It also saves time to read,</p>
<p>2. Because the content of small newspapers is suitable for the psychology of the general public, interesting, novel, police-like, obscene, and sometimes publishes news that large newspapers dare not publish (because of this, there was a cry that small newspapers were more truthful than large newspapers in the past), as well as rumors that are enough to stimulate ordinary people.</p>
<p>3. Small newspapers not only provide news facts (of course, a small number), but also provide interest, so people are happy to get both.</p>
<p>For these reasons, small newspapers sell better than large newspapers, and general newspaper merchants are naturally very enthusiastic about publishing them. Although some also rise and fall with life and death, they are still gradually increasing. Some small newspapers have a long history and are deeply rooted.</p>
<p>From the above reasons, it can be seen that the demonstration newspaper does have its own characteristics that attract people. If it can be run from the starting point of the fundamental meaning of the news business, then the welfare given to the public is certainly indelible. But unfortunately, the general so-called small newspapers only focus on the purpose of speculation and profit, and also because most of the editors are people of the old era, the content (that is, the substance) is made very bad, containing a lot of toxic substances. These bad substances not only give the public a bad tendency, but also invisibly affect the future of the news business. We only need to look at the old-fashioned, strong low-level tastes, boring and even rogue nature of those small newspapers, and the lack of educational significance, and we can understand how great a bad influence they have on people (not only readers).</p>
<p>Therefore, it is very necessary and inevitable to create new small newspapers to replace those old ones. Newspaper popularization and newspaper cheapening are the fundamental meaning and goal of starting small newspapers. In other words, to achieve that, the form of small newspapers is very adoptable.</p>
<p>But we must pay attention to the motive for starting the journal. This is very important. To make newspapers cheaper and more popular is certainly one of the motives for starting small newspapers. But I think what is more important is: at this time of transition between new and old small newspapers, the new small newspapers should bear a revolutionary responsibility, and the new small newspapers should be different from the old small newspapers, and strive to make their content new, modern, substantial, and have educational significance... By using this method of reform, the old small newspapers will be invisibly hit, causing the corrupt ones to be abandoned by readers and eliminated, losing their ability to release poison.</p>
<p>This is a destructive attitude, but destruction is necessary for construction. Naturally, conversely, to make this destructive attitude effective, it is also necessary to first build up one's own substance.</p>
<p>Now let's take a look at the current new small newspapers, what is their motive, and what is their substance?</p>
<p>The slogan of newspaper popularization has been shouted out. Some even "aim to sell millions per day." This, of course, is correct. In order to allow more people to read newspapers (although to put it bluntly, it is also to make themselves get more of the price of running a newspaper), it was the original meaning of running a newspaper, but as far as I can see, there is no one who can take the kind of destructive motive I mentioned above and use it as one of the goals.</p>
<p>This can be seen from the content of most newly published small newspapers. Naturally, some have also been reformed - for example, changing the text to vernacular, and embellishing the boring news with interesting words, etc., but it is mostly a reform of the superficial form, and the substantive reform is still less. Everyone is still just blindly indulging in low-level tastes. To be honest, low-level taste is the fatal wound of all publications. Even if it can make sales good, it often loses its fundamental meaning. It is also a very good means to slightly incline the content to taste to increase the reading interest of the shallow public; but if it is too low-level, it will still be like the old small newspapers, and it will instead apply poison to the public. Secondly, each newspaper is still like the old small newspapers, and the scope of content adopted is too narrow; praising corners and talking about prostitutes is the most inferior tendency of the old small newspapers; and the newly rising ones also still play this old tune; exposing personal privacy, creating rumors and slanders, is also the most inferior tendency of the old small newspapers, and the newly rising ones still have it. Some pay extra attention to reporting the private affairs of some celebrities and literati, and abandon the important reports of the world, the country, and the society (on this point, I think the Times Daily has the necessity of recommending it). I feel that such narrowness really cannot make people feel what is different between the newly rising and the old ones. Since there is no difference, then the destructive power mentioned above is not at all, let alone the need for construction. As a result, I am afraid that the new will eventually become the old.</p>
<p>I hope that people who run small newspapers can pay attention to their reforms. Especially in the sense of promoting "destruction."</p>
<h3>Introducing Lin Yutang's Geography</h3>
<p>— Quan Jia</p>
<p>Translated by Chuan Donghua / Published by New Life Bookstore</p>
<p>As usual, a geography book is not easy to write well. Although some people have used travelogue style to write geography, it has not achieved much success. This book is a very strange book. It is neither like a stereotyped article that makes people's heads swell when they look at it, nor does it focus on interest and ignore meaning. The purpose of this book is to let us know the relationship between humans and nature, and it does not tell us to memorize the names of mountains and rivers.</p>
<p>Lin Yutang himself said: "My work is all based on intellectual and humanistic points of view. I want to try to point out that "man" is more important than anything in the world - more important than religion, painting, and literature. I want to make people understand that "man" is the center of the universe!" The author, Lin Yutang, got rid of the attitude of scholars in the past. He brought knowledge out of the "study room" of experts, freed it of its feet, and went to the free road! Chuan Donghua once said in "About the Author": "This book uses the torch of humanism in the 20th century to clearly illuminate the buried culture!" Well, readers, remember this sentence and read this strange book!</p>
<p>For example, in the chapter about the Republic of China, he specifically mentioned the "Yellow Peril" chapter, in which he said:</p>
<p>"Because the Yellow River used to flow south into the Yellow Sea. But in 1852, it suddenly changed its course, but the word "flood" in Chinese means a real "flood." Since the end of the seventeenth century, the Yellow River has changed its outlet ten times. In other places, dikes can be used to prevent river breaks, but in the Yellow River and Yangtze River, dikes are not needed. For example, in 1852, the dike that broke the Yellow River was originally as high as fifty feet, but it broke through like a piece of manure paper."</p>
<p>In a short passage, isn't Lin Yutang already telling you a fragment of China's water disaster? He also talked about China's recent situation.</p>
<p>"When the aggression of foreign powers against China became too obvious, the Chinese had learned a lesson and knew that the Western countries were going to China, not with the greatest interest in the books of Confucius, but with more interest in coal, iron, and oil. China then began to realize the need to quickly engage in "Westernization" by emulating Japan.</p>
<p>I am not a prophet. I don't know what will happen in the next ten or fifteen years. But I expect that the situation will not change much, because China is catching up too late. But if she does catch up, then may God have mercy on us, because, cough, how will we have to pay a bill at that time, what a bill!" (See chapter 37 for the original text)</p>
<p>There have been two translations of Chinese before and after. One is jointly translated by Mr. Chen Shoushi and Hu Dianwei, entitled "Lin Yutang's World Geography," and the other is translated by Mr. Chuan Donghua, entitled "Our World." I cannot criticize the merits of the two, but the former is a free translation and the latter is a literal translation. In order to leave a perfect true image in the minds of readers, I chose the latter book.</p>
<p>I hope to broadcast this kind of world knowledge that everyone cannot do without to the public level, and I solemnly point out this useful book. Some small common sense,</p>
<h3>Bookstore Scenes</h3>
<p>— Li Hengzhi</p>
<p>—Some small common sense, not business acumen—</p>
<p>(1) Opening a bookstore</p>
<p>The old gentleman said: "Huh! Opening a bookstore, it's only happening now!" This means that the old gentleman cannot get used to the new bookstores that publish books that are neither "classics and history" nor "collections of philosophers." Secondly, that is also true. The "trend" of "opening a bookstore" really only began around 1927. There were bookstores before, but not the new bookstores of today. There were people who opened bookstores before, but "opening a bookstore" did not become a "trend" for intellectuals.</p>
<p>In the past, the so-called bookstores were mainly those "Shufang (山房)" and "Shuwu (書屋)" and the like, bookstores specializing in printing old books (such as Xiaojing Shufang (校經山房), Saoye Shufang (掃葉山房), and Youzheng Shuju (有正書局), which are very famous in Shanghai), Since the Meiji Restoration, the new foreign school system was imported, and China's "schools" have also changed in nature slightly. There was a need for the printing of new textbooks, and new bookstores followed. Generated and developed, but until after the May Fourth Movement, the New Culture Movement surged up, but all the "new" bookstores were only a few such as the Commercial Press, the China Book Company, and the Civilization Book Company. Later, because the development of the Commercial Press was particularly large, except for the general gentlemen who paid attention to the version went to the old book stalls in Beiping and the book collections in various places to buy "Ming edition" and "Song edition," in the minds of general elementary school students, middle school students (and even college students), The so-called bookstore is only the Commercial Press. From this, we can see the "reality" of "bookstores."</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the progress of culture promotes the development of bookstores, or the development of bookstores causes the progress of culture, in short, that time was really too lonely in the cultural circle. In addition to some textbooks, the so-called social science books that don't hurt or itch, and the semi-new and semi-old novels (such as the translations represented by Lin's translations of novels and the Novel World's wildman records, etc. are also similar), go and flip through the so-called large bookstores at that time, such as the Commercial Press, the China Book Company, and the Civilization. What kind of things are there that are related to cultural promotion?</p>
<p>We have to praise the new impetus of the publishing industry triggered by the National Revolution! Around 1925, as far as Shanghai is concerned, new stimuli occurred in the publishing industry! Taidong did not attract everyone's attention at that time, Guanghua Book Company was established, the creation of the Creative Society Publishing Department, and the southward migration of the Beixin Book Company, for Shanghai, which was called the "publishing center" of the publishing industry, no matter what it was, several sons were thrown into the still swamp, followed by the spring tide, Nanchang, the crowd, the New Life, Kaiming, and Liming. The companies Xingqi, and then created a very popular "asking bookstore" trend. At that time, the general youth's understanding of the publishing industry changed: not only did the Commercial Press not be the only representative of the bookstore, but also the Commercial Press was equal to the previous "Shan". "Shufang" Bookstores, old book industry, and new bookstores have become three irreconcilable things. —To be continued—</p>

<h3>The Serious Problem of Quitting Smoking</h3>
<p>— Physician Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>(1) A Difficulty in the Process of Quitting Smoking</p>
<p>Prohibition of smoking! Prohibition of smoking! This cry has been going on for a long time. Recently, the government has resolutely implemented effective measures to completely ban smoking, setting deadlines for registration and quitting. Those who secretly smoke or resist will be severely punished. Therefore, under this intense crackdown, smokers cannot help but feel uneasy and are determined to quit.</p>
<p>Everyone knows the harm of smoking, and smokers also suffer from the shackles of addiction and the pain of quitting, leading to delays and hesitation. However, now they must quit. Therefore, how to alleviate the pain in the process of quitting has become a serious problem.</p>
<p>In the process of quitting smoking, various unpleasant ailments often arise, causing quitters to hesitate, fear moving forward, and be reluctant to let go. The principle behind these ailments is something that those trying to quit must understand.</p>
<p>When smoking, the toxins in the smoke stimulate the entire nervous system, causing a temporary boost of excitement. It also stimulates the entire lymphatic system, causing irregular and excessive secretions of internal hormones. Internal hormones are essential for life, so smokers seem to feel a hundred times better after smoking. However, this kind of irregular and stimulating secretion eventually becomes exhausted, which is not the right way. It also forms a paralysis, making smoking indispensable, leading to addiction and poisoning.</p>
<p>Based on the clinical experience of general physicians, patients quitting smoking suffer from various ailments and pains due to a lack of internal hormones. However, when "Reproductive Element" (生殖素), a glandular preparation of Stanard, is administered, the function of internal hormones is immediately restored to normalcy and vigor, and all symptoms disappear without medicine. Therefore, "Reproductive Element" is the only secret to solving the difficulties of quitting smoking.</p>
<p>(Note) Reproductive Element is sold in all major pharmacies. Those who wish to quit can identify this product and purchase it themselves.</p>
<h3>Two Emergency Common Senses</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>(2) Stroke</p>
<p>Stroke, commonly known as 中風 (zhòng fēng), is different from 卒倒 (cù dǎo, collapsing suddenly), which is in exactly the opposite position.</p>
<p>Stroke is caused by the rupture of blood vessels in the brain, where the blood compresses the brain tissue, or by the blockage of blood vessels, which interrupts blood flow to the brain. This condition is generally caused by hardening of the blood vessels, making them prone to rupture. There are prodromal symptoms such as numbness of the limbs, dizziness, tinnitus, and headache. People who suffer from syphilis, alcoholism, or excessive obesity due to abnormal internal endocrine function are prone to this disease. This condition is very dangerous and different from sudden collapse, posing a risk to life.</p>
<p>Emergency treatment before seeking medical attention: Loosen the patient's clothing and belt, and let them lie down comfortably with their head slightly elevated to reduce blood pressure. Apply cold water or an ice pack to the forehead. Those who usually take the endocrine preparation "Reproductive Element" should not suffer from this condition.</p>
<h3>Learning from Nocturnal Emission</h3>
<p>— Submitted by Li Bingzhang</p>
<p>In my youth, I was misled by obscene books and indulged in the harm of masturbation. I damaged my body in secret, day after day, and I don't know how much essence I lost. This is truly painful.</p>
<p>In the autumn of my nineteenth year, I took a job in Shanghai and immediately felt a decline in energy. So I resolved to quit my bad habits. However, I immediately began to suffer from nocturnal emission. At first, I would have dreams and then ejaculate, but later, I would ejaculate without dreams. The symptoms became more and more severe, increasing from once every few days to more than twenty times a month. At most, I would ejaculate frequently in one night. As a result, I felt extremely tired, dizzy, had blurred vision, tinnitus, lower back pain, insomnia, and poor memory. Later, I sought treatment at Dr. Ren Guoxiang's clinic. He prescribed Schmidt's Guqing Tablets to treat my nocturnal emission. After the nocturnal emission was cured, I took Reproductive Element to replenish my body. In about two months, all my symptoms disappeared, and my health was better than ever. Looking back on the treatment process, it can serve as a reference for those with the same condition. Therefore, I quickly wrote it down and submitted it to this publication.</p>
<h3>Stomach Ailments Should Be Treated Quickly</h3>
<p>— Physician Zhou Xiaohan</p>
<p>The stomach is the main organ in the human body for absorbing nutrients. If its function is strong, the body will be healthy. If it is diseased, it cannot absorb sufficient nutrients, and the body will suffer from various complications due to nutritional imbalance.</p>
<p>Loss of appetite, constipation, and bad breath are all caused by stomach dysfunction. Taking Stomach Pain Remedy (胃痛靈) quickly can boost appetite and eliminate all gastrointestinal disorders. If medication is delayed, heartburn, abdominal pain, nausea, indigestion, and stomach pain will follow, making the pain even worse. Based on our clinical experience, all patients with stomach disorders have recovered completely after taking "Stomach Pain Remedy." It is especially effective for treating long-term stomach ailments.</p>
<h3>The Remarkable Effectiveness of Schmidt's Guqing Tablets</h3>
<p>— Submitted by Tang Houzhai</p>
<p>Report on the Cure of a Patient with Years of Nocturnal Emission</p>
<p>I developed too early and learned about sexual matters too early. At the age of fourteen, I started masturbating, partly due to the toxicity of obscene books and partly due to the seduction of bad friends. I damaged my body day after day, and the loss was very severe. From the age of sixteen, I suffered from ejaculation. Since then, my body has lost its health and gradually weakened. I painfully quit masturbation, but the ejaculation continued. At the age of eighteen, I completed my marriage under my mother's order. From that year on, the ejaculation changed from once every few days to more than twenty times a month. I was panicked and took various pills randomly, but not only were they ineffective, but they also increased the problem. Last year, I saw a friend's ejaculation cured by taking Schmidt's Guqing Tablets, so I also bought them. Before I finished two boxes, ejaculation was rarely seen. After continuing to take two boxes, ejaculation disappeared completely. After years of old ailments, once removed, I am very happy. Now, I am following the doctor's advice and taking Reproductive Element to replenish my body. My body is becoming stronger day by day, and my spirit is becoming more fulfilled. Ah, Schmidt's Guqing Tablets are truly a great savior for ejaculation patients.</p>
<p>(Note) Taking Reproductive Element to replenish the body after ejaculation is most effective.</p>
<h3>Disease Q&amp;A</h3>

<p>Vaginal Discharge Infertile</p>
<p>Fang Shunfa asks: I have been married for ten years and have no children. I don't know if it is because my wife has vaginal discharge. If it is due to vaginal discharge, please quickly tell me the treatment method as a thank you.</p>

<h3>The Pain of Neurasthenia</h3>
<p>— Physician Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>The human body's physiology has several major systems. The first is the blood circulation system, which is responsible for delivering blood to all parts of the body. The second is the lymphatic system, which secretes and absorbs nutrients from the blood and distributes them to all parts of the body. The third is the nervous system, which controls the will and commands all parts of the body, causing various activities. In addition, bones, muscles, and tendons are distributed throughout the body, each forming its own system. If one system is diseased, the entire body is affected, such as anemia in the blood system, lack of internal hormones and malnutrition in the lymphatic system, and weakness in the nervous system. Among these, diseases caused by the nervous system cause the most problems and the greatest pain, such as forgetfulness, insomnia, fatigue, thinness, premature aging, infertility, lower back pain, and back pain, all caused by neurasthenia. Based on our clinical experience, administering Stanard's Reproductive Element to the above-mentioned ailments always yields the most satisfactory results. Reproductive Element contains internal hormones that nourish the nerves, embryo glands (ie, Cimbaomin), and vital elements such as vitamins, so it is effective in treating the above-mentioned symptoms and has the effect of curing diseases.</p>

<p>Discussion</p>
<h3>The Bargaining Between England and France</h3>
<p>— Li Min</p>
<p>Ever since the Italian Blackshirt Prime Minister Mussolini resolved to conquer the black king of Abyssinia in distant East Africa, to fulfill the obligation to this "barbaric" nation—and voluntarily pay a great price—to instill the "civilization" of European whites, this incident has immediately transformed the Italian conquest of the "barbaric" nation into a dispute between England and Italy over colonies.</p>
<p>England's interests in African colonies and in the Mediterranean Sea are such that it must exert "nine bulls and two tigers" to maintain them; however, Germany is its only ally on the European continent. The difficulty of the problem lies in this point. Should it still contact France and jointly attack Italy? Or would it rather abandon contact with France and continue to contact Germany to jointly prepare for a larger attack on the Soviet Union than Italy? England's current diplomacy is really undecided on this point. We can clearly see where its painstaking efforts lie.</p>
<p>France is also cunning. On the German issue, it has always wanted to obtain England's cooperation and jointly oppress Germany, but England's answer to it has been the opposite, contacting Germany to oppress France. This situation has forced France to change its previous attitude in the past two years and contact the Soviet Union, which holds completely opposite positions. This time, the Italian expedition to Abyssinia occurred, and France hoped that this event could change England's previous attitude towards France in order to jointly sanction Italy in exchange for England's assistance in sanctioning Germany. Therefore, when England's request for France to jointly sanction Italy reached France, France put forward a precondition, saying: If Germany invades Austria, will England also help France sanction Germany? England's answer was very cunning, saying that it would depend on the situation at that time and cannot be predetermined at present (see the telegraph news in the newspaper on the 28th). France naturally felt disappointed. Therefore, whether France's future diplomatic policy is to assist England or Italy is a very interesting question.</p>
<p>The diplomacy between England and France is currently in such a bargaining situation. On the one hand, we have received news from the newspaper that Germany is actively preparing to attack Russia. The East is also accelerating its preparations. Perhaps when the curtain of the Second World Massacre is unfolded, the Soviet Union, which dominates Northern Europe, will become an enlarged Abyssinia under the guns of various powers.</p>
<h3>Words of the Heart</h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>When the cold moonlight shines on the coconut branches, when the small grass on the tomb top falls, when the lingering smoky rain covers the mountains and seas, it is when I am facing the autumn wind and shedding tears for the tragic memories. With memories, my thoughts have been confused. I cannot clearly count whether it was last year or the year before. It has always been very long and very far away. But I still feel as vivid as if it were in front of me, which gradually turns into an incurable heart failure symptom. Linzi, I would not hesitate to use my own hands to cut my own throat and end this laborious life, so that I can lie in the underground cave with you. Only for the sake of the traction of your last few words, I am always holding the idea of not being able to let you down. In this way, I silently drag up a broken body, and three years of time have passed in a trance. Like the early autumn god</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>spreading the brocade on the mountains and seas, thinking that your graveyard should have another degree of desolation, and there is no shepherd's song, then you are still lonely. And I am still staying in a different place, and I can only perform a wild heart sacrifice by vaguely watching the moon on the sea head when I knock the twilight bells of the ancient church of Sakyamuni. Linzi, if you are conscious, you should be able to imagine how I am living a day more frightened than a nightmare. From that day on, my soul has been taken away by some demons at the same time, but I still don't believe that you will be able to walk so leisurely, so unencumbered, as if there is really nothing in the world worthy of your nostalgia. Linzi, definitely not, I know that you must have hidden to the ground with eternal regrets. Therefore, I know that you, the person who was mourned, must have more words in your heart than anyone else, but you finally left silently without leaving a word.</p>
<p>I often dream that on the distant plains, I am slightly bedridden, with sharp silver arrows running through my heart, and I seem to see the shadow of the Muhammad statue on the high tower pushed in front of me like a wall, feeling a burst of shock, and then I wake up. It turned out that I was still lying on the table, and the bleak lamp flowers were stroking my lungs, which were stretched tightly and exhaling emptiness. I suddenly found a patch of bright red blood stains dyed on my lapel, which was moist and had not dried out yet. I was not afraid at all, but deeply wondered how such a sick and frail body still had so much blood. I could not help but regret that my blood should not be shed in vain at this time. I should save it up to wait for the day to go to your grave and pour it out to my heart's content as the only sacrifice!</p>
<p>When the news of my imprisonment reached you, you abandoned all obstacles and difficulties, and came to this island from a distant island country after three days and nights of sea travel. Later, you used many methods to meet me. I still clearly remember that day you were wearing a plain light dress, and you looked even more like a delicate white hibiscus in the spring breeze. And what was completely unexpected was that you smiled at me with no sorrow or sadness. Because that place was not a place where you could say much, you only said briefly: "Wait, the sun will never leave you." Although it was a short sentence, your whole soul and passionate tone had moved me to tears. If I were allowed to cry out loud, I would have cried out loud at that time. My deep, dark, well-like heart was like a stone thrown into it, and countless waves suddenly surged up. Yes, Linzi, you are the sun, the forever bright sun in my heart. Without you shining, I am afraid I would have ceased to exist in this world.</p>
<p>My crime could only be canceled with a lot of gold. Therefore, thanks to you for selling all your gold jewelry; if it was not enough, you had to raise it everywhere in a shameful way. I finally returned to the world under the sun, but at the same time I decided to leave the sun in my heart. You, on the contrary, left the world under the sun and went to another dark world. Linzi, is the world really so bleak? Who can I tell my grievances and sorrow?</p>
<p>Autumn is deep, and the red hibiscus in the south will change from bright to yellow and wither. Linzi, your enthusiastic ten youthful lives, like red hibiscus, are easy to thank and flourish. Could it be that you are the incarnation of the flower demon? I carry the heavy burden of sin and human affection on my shoulders, with a tired breath, sighing, stumbling in the wind and rain, in the dark, on the boundless journey of the wilderness. I only see the spread of dark clouds, but I have never greeted the dawn. No tears, no hope, but Linzi, is your immortal soul also drifting, why can't I even chase it in my dreams?</p>
<h3>Memories of the Ancient City</h3>
<p>— Luo Zhihua</p>
<p>Camels shake "May I" all day long...</p>
<p>Tuning the sad elegy in the autumn wind,</p>
<p>Yellow sand, yellow leaves,</p>
<p>Lining the loneliness in the lonely heart.</p>
<p>Although I have been to ×× for three years, there is always a shadow of an ancient city in my deep memory! There are buildings with historical and cultural value, blending with the vast desert, in this ancient city - Kaifeng, just like a dead curtain, there is no trace of vitality, urban atmosphere: but, I miss that place very much, the above poem was written three years ago in the summer when I missed my friends in Kaifeng. - I love it there, I love the simplicity and loyalty of the lives of the people there.</p>
<p>Speaking of Guanfeng, I think of Beiping.</p>
<p>Before I went to Beiping, I had dreamed of the situation in Beiping, and most of my imagination was exaggerated too much, so I thought that there must be: camels shaking their dumb copper bells, walking in the desert, its quietness is like a wanderer. At the same time, on the desolate streets, only the sound of the wooden fish of the old monks floated out of the temple and echoed. Other than that, it was all loneliness, the loneliness of death.</p>
<p>However, one autumn, when I walked out of the "Qianmen Station," everything was not as I imagined. Most of these imaginations were related to living in Kaifeng.</p>
<p>Kaifeng is indeed an ancient city.</p>
<p>Xiangguo Temple, Yuwangtai, Iron Pagoda, and Longting all retain their ancient flavor.</p>
<p>However, it has also been gradually invaded by modern civilization.</p>
<p>For example, Xiangguo Temple, its content is similar to the Tianqiao in Beiping and the Chenghuang Temple in Shanghai. It is a place of entertainment for the petty bourgeoisie. In the past, many things were stored in the temple halls. After the Northern Expedition, they all became general people's clubs. No one knows how many people play here every day, and no one knows how many people are happy. The Northern Expedition revived Xiangguo Temple.</p>
<p>Longting, it was the old palace of the Song Dynasty. If you walk to the heights of this palace and look around on a dusk, you can't help but think of the nobility of the emperor. At that time, he could look at the vast land and the boundless fog in the distance. The reason why he wanted to build the palace so high was also to demonstrate to the people. Layers of steps represent layers of official ranks. He sat on the magnificent hall at the end of the steps, making everyone admire him; the indigenous people said, "The emperor sits on the Jinluan Hall, and the governor can only meet in the Wu Chao Gate! - I dare not lift my head"!</p>
<p>After the Northern Expedition, it was also made public. Many fantasies were broken.</p>
<p>The Iron Pagoda is even a great building. It is all built of glazed tiles, thirteen levels high, and the outside is exposed to the sun, reflecting green, purple, and red light. From the highest level, you can see the long body of the Yellow River like a jade belt.</p>
<p>Yuwangtai, although it has been abandoned, still retains its natural beauty.</p>
<p>My childhood was completely lost in this ancient city. And this ancient city has cultivated my character to be so melancholy. Every time I think of my hometown, I first remember the suffering of the floods, and then I think of this city.</p>
<h3>Night Crossing</h3>
<p>— Shen Wu</p>
<p>As I passed Ox Head Ridge, the sky gradually darkened. Looking back at the layers of mountain shadows, and the clusters of wild trees, the undergrowth, and the pine forest, the surrounding scenery was bleak and gloomy. Even if one had a gourd-sized胆子 (courage), one couldn't help but tremble in one's heart; moreover, the bandits here were even more ferocious than the large stronghold on the skirt of Mountain Dai.</p>
<p>Eight legs moved ever more closely on the winding mountain road, the bamboo sandals scraping against the mud and sand with "sha suo," "sha suo" sounds. Everyone seemed to complain that the sky was getting dark too quickly: "Damn it, we haven't even reached Black Water Ferry yet." However, no matter what, our pace couldn't get much faster. The more anxious we felt, the less energy we had to walk. I wondered if we were bewitched by some ghost? In the past, we would cross the Black Water before the sun even set, but today we only just passed Ox Head Ridge. Wouldn't it be three watches later before we got home?</p>
<p>Turning around a winding path surrounded by wild brambles, I shifted the pole from my left shoulder to my right. At that moment, I suddenly felt a bit of pain in my shoulder. I reached back to rub it, then forced myself to keep walking. I had walked almost a whole day, and I gradually felt that the load was indeed much heavier than usual. No wonder Old Song was complaining this morning that the goods were piled up more and more, while I sleepily rubbed my bleary eyes and didn't say a word, so I was taken advantage of again...</p>
<p>By the time we reached that dark, deep river, the moon had already poked its head out from behind the mountains. The riverbank was covered with another thicket of dense weeds. Some sounded like frogs, but not quite, making "ge la," "ge la" noises in the grass.</p>
<p>Looking at the ferry landing, it seemed there were no lights. Er Lin became quite anxious and shouted loudly at the boatman, "Hey! Bastard!" But Old Zhu stopped him short:</p>
<p>"Stupid pig, are you trying to sell us out to the enemy? Shouting so loud!...Better go closer to the dock and take a look."</p>
<p>Everyone also complained a little about Er Lin's recklessness.</p>
<p>As we approached the ferry landing, the boat was indeed not moored there. Looking across the river, there was no sign of it either. The moon was hazy, only illuminating the turbulent flow of the dark water like a sandy shoal. The sound of the river mingled with the chirping of insects in the mountains, very clear and pleasant.</p>
<p>We put down our loads, and our hearts truly grew anxious. Everyone looked at each other in dismay. Er Lin glared at Old Zhu, as if seeking revenge.</p>
<p>"Where did that dog's bastard go with the boat? Pig—" Although he was still angrily cursing, his voice was much lower, so only the few of us here could hear him.</p>
<p>The night was silent and vast. Amidst the alarm and anxiety, Old Song was the most able to remain calm. He shone his flashlight around the river surface, and a beam of white light swept across the weeds by the riverbank. Sure enough, under a large black rock, we saw the small ferry boat. Only then did everyone smile and pick up their loads, heading toward the rock wall. The weeds rustled as we moved through them.</p>
<p>"Pig, aren't you going to carry our goods? You pig's get, still sleeping?..."</p>
<p>Old Zhu shone his flashlight on the boatman's face, and he slowly rubbed his eyes and lit the oil lamp. Several people threw the goods into the boat's cabin, and Er Lin alone collapsed on the deck, dozing off.</p>
<p>The boat swayed into the middle of the river in the fast-flowing Black Water. The hull gradually swayed a little uneasily.</p>
<p>"Hey, pig, steer carefully, don't send your ancestors to their graves!"</p>
<p>Everyone watched the turbulent river with anxious hearts. The moon slowly climbed up the mountain peak.</p>

<h3>Wind</h3>
<p>— Xiong Zilei</p>
<p>A season of drifting, a September of drifting, a September night of drifting. I often walk by the quiet lake, watching the pale lamplight floating on the water, my heart shrouded in fog as I think.</p>
<p>Gleaming stars, blending with the serene moon, everything is steeped in melancholy. The wind, blowing from the distant north, brings a whispered farewell of falling leaves, heralding the arrival of autumn!</p>
<p>I gazed towards the direction the wind was blowing for a long time; however, I found nothing. I could only close my eyes and listen quietly to the wind's playing.</p>
<p>This rhythm-less music made me recall many old days, made me depict many old joys and sorrows. Wind that makes one wither and fade!</p>
<p>I look at my shadow printed on the ground, enough to confuse me; however, when the wind blows, even the shadow sways! Am I entering another world of old age?</p>
<p>Ah, everything is aging in the playing of the wind!</p>
<p>I return with sorrowful steps.</p>

<h3>New Song Introduction</h3>
<p>The Washing Song</p>
<p>A song from Shanghai Sound Film "Peach Blossom Dream"</p>
<p>The clear water flows and flows, flowing over the shallows and over the bridge. The shallows' water plays a musical tune, the women under the bridge sing high. Sister Zhang comes early, all kinds of clothes float on the water. Sister-in-law Li comes early, all kinds of clothes spread on the stones. This year is really not good, not warm enough to wear, not full enough to eat. We wear torn pants with ragged coats, eat pancakes with fried dough sticks. Everyone is diligent and frugal without worries, enduring and persevering.</p>
<p>The clear water flows gently and slowly, some families are happy, some are sad. The happy ones enjoy themselves enough, the sorrowful ones are lonely and sad. Sister Zhang holds hands, holding the hands of a flowery good friend. Sister-in-law Li has an ugly temper, her unemployed husband has gone away to work. This year is really not free, money is not stable, love doesn't last long. We wear shiny satin with bright silk, eat big fish with fatty meat. It harms the poor, hard to find a partner, the rich can embrace anyone they like.</p>
<p>The clear water flows and flows, some are carefree, some are busy. The carefree ones idly wander and sway, the busy ones panic with no destination. Sister Zhang thinks all day about following a rich, white-haired man. Sister-in-law Li thinks all day about winning the first prize in the aviation lottery. This year, if one runs out of food, one won't live long. We wear pawn tickets, selling everything we can, eat mixed swill with thin soup. Everyone is finding ways to relieve the disaster, to avoid the poor dying out completely.</p>

<p>Mr. Weak Legs Rectification Letter, (Whether Chen Jingfang is indeed married or not, there is no need to debate it like this. Fortunately, your husband must have drunk wedding wine. Perhaps it is that Miss Chen is either a relative or a friend!) The "Shishi Xinbao" radio is also your great work, Mr. Legs. After reading it, I am extremely admired. This is indeed true. Your great work has the value and necessity of being published repeatedly (It would be best to ask the people in the radio circle of "Shehui Ribao", like Yin Yu, to also connect it). There was a passage published in the "Xin Ye Bao": "Zhang Ru, nickname Cai Di," signed "Weak Legs," which is of course also written by you, Mr. Legs. However, I saw in "Xie Xing Tu Hua Bao" that it also said the same words: "Zhang Ru, nickname Cai Di." I wonder if it was also written by you, Mr. Legs, or if the newspaper plagiarized your great work?</p>
<p>Jiang Manli visited Lili Radio Station one day, guest-starring in the Rose Troupe's specialty, "Farewell Brother," her vocal tone seemed slightly worse than before, probably due to accidental overwork during her last performance in various places!</p>
<p>Wang Zhen praised the Rose Troupe when he was in it, but after leaving, he said how the Rose Troupe was. After joining the Nightingale Troupe, he praised the Nightingale Troupe, but now that he has left the Nightingale Troupe, he is saying how the Nightingale Troupe is. Wang Zhen is truly just a young brother, with sugar, it's sweet, without sugar, it's bitter!</p>
<p>The Rose Troupe broadcast on the Municipal Sound Station for one day (the 1st), and stopped the next day, saying that the Hakka people did not welcome this radio station. This angered Director Wang of the radio station, and he "telegraphed" the Rose Troupe on the 1st, saying, "Whenever you have time, I will find a way to drag out the program for you to sing!" Angering someone by saying angry words, Zhou Gong was amused on the side. (Above Copper Thunder) (Mr. Copper Thunder: The letter said that two manuscripts were sent, but after careful inspection, only this one was found. I assume you forgot, so I hereby report it, Editor)</p>
<p>Ms. Ma Laofen's Wonderful Sound Troupe, which pioneered broadcasting, will broadcast a formal program soon.</p>
<p>The New China Opera Company, Da Jin and Miss Jiang, have returned to Shen. Xiao Jin and Miss Gu have not yet returned, for reasons unknown. (It is said that they have also come to Shanghai, Editor)</p>
<p>Recently, an old-fashioned counterfeit Yan Yan Society has been discovered in Shanghai. The genuine Yan Yan Society was founded in 1933, hosted by Zhou Kebao, and led and advised by Ms. Ma Laofen. The counterfeit broadcasts on the Mainland Radio. Attention from all sectors.</p>
<p>The grandly scaled Yasheng Society is run by Mr. Zhou Qigao of the Peking Opera world. The internal organization is complete, and the singing ladies are the best talents in the entire broadcasting industry.</p>
<p>Ms. Zhou Jie, a female member of the Xinhua Society, has joined the Minghui Troupe after returning to Shen, at a rate of eight yuan per show, it is said.</p>
<p>After Ma Tinglong and Wu Wenying returned to Shen from the Ningbo Rose Troupe, the troupe lacked talent. Now, a large number of talents have been transferred from Shen to Yong, and investigations have revealed that they are little XXs from Shanghai.</p>
<p>Zhang Huichong's Magic Troupe will arrive in Shen soon and will perform at the Carlton, it is said.</p>
<p>In the broadcasting industry, the running-errands gentleman is called Ma Xingtao, I wonder what that means?</p>
<p>Hu Shuxin, the former leader of the Songfeng Troupe, is recently day-dreaming again, using other people's gimmicks in the newspaper.</p>
<p>Ms. Jiang Yunyu, a strong amateur singer, is a student at Biven Girls' School in this city, is proficient in piano, and it is said that she will soon gather several comrades to broadcast a special program over the airwaves.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Mohong, the former harmonica director of the Bailu Society, has recently suffered an unspeakable heartache regarding Ms. Gu Huihong. The details are unknown.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang, the leader of the XX Arts Society of Huadong Broadcasting from 4:00 to 5:15 PM every day, is extremely proud. He truly has no one in his eyes among the old seniors in the broadcasting industry.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Rui, the chief editor (self-proclaimed chief editor) of a certain newspaper in Hankou, is actually licentious and has bad intentions, wanting to win the favor of Miss Zhou of a certain troupe, doing everything possible, truly like a toad wanting to eat swan meat. (Above Xinmin Society)</p>
<p>The height of the microphone at Donglu Radio makes the singers uneasy. "Dai Ping" admits to being from Guangdong.</p>
<p>The Yan Yan Society is entirely organized by several daughters from the lychee province of Guangdong. The leading lady is "Yang Chunmei." The promotional drafts of several amateur groups of ladies are so boastful that even "Bai Hong," one of the three major singers, sighs in admiration. (Above Electric Wind)</p>
<p>The charity entertainment conference organized by the city's radio broadcasting industry has scheduled a Shanghai Opera grand gathering for the daytime performance on the 18th of this month, a storytelling gathering for the evening performance on the 18th and the daytime performance on the 19th, a music and singing gathering for the evening performance on the 19th, a Suzhou Beach Opera gathering for the daytime performance on the 20th, and Peking Opera by famous amateurs for the evening performance on the 20th. The programs are so wonderful that they are unprecedented, so all sectors should purchase tickets as soon as possible, otherwise they will surely miss out. Ticket prices are divided into one yuan and two yuan. All radio stations and business storefronts in the city with white characters on a blue background are acting as agents for sales.

<h3>Kaige's Behind-the-Scenes Drama</h3>
<p>— Bai Mu</p>
<p>This is an old story, but not too old, and very interesting, so I will mention it here.</p>
<p>A week or ten days ago, the Yihua "Kaige" photography crew went to Suzhou to shoot outdoor scenes. The first day's work location was Liuyuan Garden. Liuyuan is the best-known garden in Wu, with excellent scenery, and is the only leisure destination for Suzhou gentry and women. The garden has a lotus pond, which is very wide. Although the lotus flowers have withered, the green leaves are still lush. Therefore, they ordered a paper flower shop to specially make hundreds of lotus flowers tied to the skeletons, no less than the reappearance of the lotus blooming season.</p>
<p>Because on that day, no fewer than hundreds of people came to sightsee in admiration of Yuan Meiyun's fame, and the scene was to shoot Yuan Meiyun and Sun Zeyi rowing a boat in the pool for several shots, the new photographer Wu Weiyun had to go into the pool to work. However, the pool water was dirty and unbearable, and the bottom of the pool was nauseating mud. Moreover, although the sun was out, the weather was very cold, so when he finished shooting several shots, his lips had turned bronze, and he was "ge ge" chattering. However, to show his bravery, he simply swam to the shore, struggling to climb ashore, but he was exhausted and couldn't climb up. At this time, among the many spectators, a friend holding a camera kindly ran to drag him, but he couldn't win, and he fell into the pool in a very excellent diving posture. Both of them were covered in mud and each tasted a few mouthfuls of stinky water. As a result, that friend quietly went to receive Bu Wancang's brandy treat amidst the laughter of the entire garden.</p>
<h3>Shirley Temple's New Film "The Littlest Rebel"</h3>
<p>— Grand Shanghai Next Wednesday Screening</p>
<h3>Silver Random Notes</h3>
<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Han told people that "Morning Tea" will be revived soon. It is said that "Movie News" will also be republished soon.</p>
<p>"The Storm" and "Night Fragrance" are competing head-to-head. As a result, the gate in front of Jincheng was deserted, while the downstairs of "Night Fragrance" was almost full for the first performance.</p>
<p>Some say that Yuan Meiyun's space is still no match for Hu Die.</p>
<p>Another person said that Yuan Tianpai's international gimmick cannot sell as much money as Hu Die's international gimmick.</p>
<p>(In Yuan Tianpai's directed "The Storm," there are many international gimmicks; while "Night Fragrance" uses Hu Die's first sound after returning from her European tour as a selling point).</p>
<p>Wei Heling in "The Storm" and Shu Xiuwen in "Night Fragrance" gave me a fresher and deeper impression in these two films than the leading actors Yuan Meiyun and Hu Die. People with stage experience are ultimately better at "getting into character" than those without cultivation. One cannot help but increasingly believe</p>
<p>Following the example of "1935 is Tan Ying's year," will 1936 be "Wei Heling's year," "Shu Xiuwen's year," or "Shang Guanwu's year"?</p>
<p>(It is said that Shang Guanwu's acting skills in "Tian Lun" and "Hero of the Times" are both extremely good).</p>
<h3>Publishing World</h3>
<p>Chang Sheng Weekly, published by Sanhe Publishing House at 138 Nanjing Road, Shanghai, decided to resume publishing a special extra-large issue on the first of each month starting last month.
