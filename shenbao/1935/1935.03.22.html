<h3>民衆敎育之進一步的實騐</h3>
<p>— 如</p>
<p>成人教育。隨此世紀之來而開始。在各國學制上初無一定的地位。然以政府之嚴切注視。巳漸成爲國民教育之一重要部門。如意大利之統一公私立民衆學校於所謂「摕除文盲委員會」（Comitato　Contro　Analfabet＇smo）統一社會教育事業於「工餘文化活動總部」（Opera　Nazionale　Ddopolavoro）。固顯示其政府厲行民衆教育之决心與勇力。又如德國各邦政府之補助「民衆高等學校」（Volksbochschule）規定於聯邦之憲法。英國初由勞動教育協會所主辦之「大學輔導班」（UniversityTutorialClasses）。亦由教育部制定法規。依法受中央與地方政府之補助。皆其最著之證明。蓋無論在民族智能之競勝上。抑在民主勢力之扶植上。民衆教育。胥有迫切之需要故也。</p>
<p>中國民教運動。始於十二年中華平民教育促進會之成立。至十六年國民革命成功。乃有鉅大的推進。近年各地方民衆教育。鄉村建設。農村服務等試騐機關。已漸引起社會一般之注意。最近江蘇省立教育學院舉行創立七週紀念。展覽成續。教育部部長及主管司長。親臨視導。而王部長在該院之演講。謂「希望全體師生。本充分的服務精神。努力建立民衆教育學術。使民衆教育成爲科學的而非常識的」。於此亦足見政府對於民教之注意。原來學術皆起於人生實際的活動。由實際活動出發。尋繹其原則。規範其方法。乃成爲學術。而學術又轉爲實際活動之指導。教育學術亦然。民衆教育之必須推行。復何待費詞與研究。惟如何推行而有效。則正待各地方試騐興研究機關。於其實際活動中。覓取正確的原則與方法。假使以若干經費與人才。經營若干之事業。其結果僅等於凡有此經費與人才皆能舉辦之事業。則亦何待於設立此試騐興研究機關。故此類機關之能否完成其使命。要以其能否提供教育上正確有效之原則與方法爲斷。其理甚明。是以吾人劉於王部長「使民衆教育成爲科學的而非常識的」一言。覺其實含至理。頗有同成。</p>
<p>抑更有進者。自二十三年教育部第一次民衆教育委員會議决「民衆教育之實施途經」。指示「各種民衆教育機關。應供給實際生活之組織。工具。與技術。並盡量舉辦實騐區及其他實騐事業」。以後所謂民衆教育。範圍擴大。已不限於識字教育。現時較大的民教實騐區。大都於農業試騐與推廣。農業倉庫。各種合作組織。公民訓練。衛生設施。乃至農村自衛各事業。皆包舉靡遺。如鄒平·定縣·更以整個縣政爲民教之試騐。論事業。已包括無數之科學。而並不限於教育。顧論學術。則任何研究。必以分業專攻爲先。卽以農業一項而言。進行研究者。有中央農業實騐所。有大學之農學院。就民教機關所有之設備與人才。恐亦祇有作小規模區域性試騐與推廣之力量。其他金融·合作·自治·自衛亦然。整個地方之改進。須有整個政治經濟之機搆。終非一教育機關所能獨勝其任。在民教機關方面。如何本其專有之學術。集中其所有之精力與財力。從事進一步較狹窄而較有控制的實騐。一方與其他機關取得聯絡而避免重複。一方對於教育。逐漸規範成有效之方法而供各地之推行。庶幾業以分而得精。力以專而得厚。誠爲一亟待縝密思考之問題。此尤吾人所願與負有民教實騐之責者。虛衷商榷者也。</p>

<p>（巴黎）本日參議院開會、討論參議員勒梅里所提出之質問案、質問政府以何法彌補因大戰時人口出生减少所造成之新兵缺額、經佛蘭亭總理發表長篇演說、加以答辯、最後參院乃以二百六十三票對二十一票通過信任政府案、佛蘭亭演詞、首述衆院通過之延長兵役法案、將一九三五年四月入伍新兵服役期間延長至十八個月、以後入伍新兵、則延長服役期間至兩年、謂此舉僅在補足一九二八年徵兵法所規定之軍額、並無擴張軍備之意、繼論及德國重整軍備一事、佛蘭亭謂、「吾人其將忍受德國重整軍備乎、吾人其將忍受軍縮會議之破產乎、是可忍、孰不可忍、法國始終力圖在相互保障安全之條件下、實行軍縮、爲一般人所周知、今世人不察、乃以爲德國宣佈廢止和約軍事條欵、係對於英國白皮書與法國延長兵役之答復、不知德國陸軍十二軍、成立將及一載、今不過加以正式佈告而已、德國此種佈告、倘爲全世界所接受、則以國聯會爲基礎之一切和平事業、悉將摧毀無遺、以吾法國而論、則斷不容接受德國此種辦法、蓋十五年來、法國政府謀德法兩大民族之提携、不遺餘力、而結果則適得其反、法國固願與德國妥協、然蔑棄眞理、否定法律公道、以求妥協、則非法國所能出此、誰負鼓動戰爭之資、全世界自有定評、法德兩民族之信任合作誠爲吾人之所屬望、然拋棄應有之職責、而言信任與合作、則烏乎其可、更有人謂法國未嘗履行其裁减軍備之約束、故德國亦不得不重整軍備、此說更屬不確、大戰後、法國常備軍額减少百分之五十、今人豈忘之乎、法國兵役年限自三年减爲一年、今人又豈忘之乎、當知法國始終期望軍縮、如大旱之望雲霓、法國所以不能再行縮减軍備、則徒以德國重整軍備故耳、有人以爲德國業巳執行凡爾賽條約之義務、此亦斷非眞相、蓋德國表面裁减軍備、而實際則無時不在重整軍備、德國秘密擴張軍備、爲世人所咸知、特德國不欲公然承認耳、至於法國歷來放棄凡爾賽條約若干主要條欵、又奚待贅述、惜乎德國均已忘之、今世人必欲曲解歷史事實、以證明其誠信合作之志願、亦僅見其心勞日絀而已、且德國究遭何國之威脅、而必欲重整軍備乎、法國以此種嚴重行動、請求國聯會處理、非爲法國自身之利益、而實爲各國共同之利益、世界和平、以正義爲其基礎、正義不存、則和平亦不可得而保、因此吾人所憂慮者、已非法德間之問題、而爲集體和平之問題、法國固有充分實力以保衛本國、並應同盟國之需求、然此外歐洲尚不乏弱小國家、倘吾人　　坐視强權替代公理、而不加補救、則此等弱小國家、其必無噍類矣、在各國平等之範圍內、修改條約、原非不可能、法國痛惡戰爭、一切措置、爲保持和平所必需者、吾人將無不加以採納、自今而後、凡吾法人、當以神聖之愛國觀念、互相國結、蓋軍事之準備、與精神之準備、斷不可分離、德國之精神準備卽其例也、彼反對軍隊及國家者、應作爲大逆不道論、若在殖民地從事宣傳、以使士民反對法國、更爲吾人所不容、吾人其速奮發愛國之精神、集合精神物質之力量、以致力於和平、使令全世界咸知法國團結一致、不可輕侮、則所厚望焉」云云、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（柏林）法總理佛蘭亭向參院大事攻訐德國、此問官塲聞之並無不安之處、因其措辭完全感情用事也、且截至現在止、此間僅悉法總理演說之撮要、尚未窺見其全豹、故其中不免增加其恫嚇語氣云、（二十一日國民電）</p>

<h3>法航空部長請增　軍費十六萬萬法郎　卽將在衆院提出議案　使飛機增至千五百架</h3>
<p>（巴黎）據航空部長台朗將軍聲稱、法國鑒於德國最近之舉動、空軍之擴張、不能再事延緩、所請增撥之經費十六萬萬法郎、可使法國之飛機由一千一百架增至一千五百架云、（二十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）法政府鑒於德國之重整軍備、决議請國會准撥法郎十六萬萬枚、擴充空軍、據航空部長台朗將軍今日宣稱、該議案卽將提交衆院、並謂將特別注意轟炸機云、按政府所請撥之欵、乃追加於上年十一月所通過之豫算案者、（二十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）航空部長鄧寗今日告法國衆院航空委員會、稱彼卽將提案、請求立卽動用明年度經費一千兆法郎、擴充法國空軍、並將要求加增經費五萬萬法郎、俾法國空軍軍費、連原有之二千兆法郎計算在內、達三十五萬萬法郎之總數云、（廿一日國民電）</p>
<h3>法意對英　恐慌稍見平復　對德漸成共同陣綫</h3>
<p>（巴黎）英法意三國現有組織共同陣綫以對付德國重整軍備所釀成之危局之可能、英掌璽大臣艾登定星期六日來此、與法外長賴伐爾及意國務次官蘇維志交換意見、英國决議派艾登與賴蘇會商、已使英國致德牒文所引起法意兩國之恐慌、稍見平復、蓋注意皆視英牒過於溫和也、聞法國曾於星期日照會英國、探討請願於國聯或以其他計劃對付德國實施强迫軍役制二事之可能性、英政府未予答覆、卽致牒向德抗議、且事前並未與法討論、法國各界頗爲忿忿故昨日賴伐爾與巴黎英大使及意代表討論時、曾直陳一切、而無所隱、注意兩國皆力主英國於外相西門屋期日赴德之前、應與注意會商、故英國乃徇從此項意見、現聞西門自德歸後、西門或艾登大約尚將赴羅馬會晤意相黑、索里尼而注意政府之會商則將進行不止、（二十一日路透電）</p>
<p>羅馬　英國外相西門掌璽大臣艾登赴德俄聘問之前及聘問以後、將兩度舉行英法意三頭會議、意國方面對於此種提議極表歡迎蓋意國行止始終出以審愼、不欲上德國之圈套、本日决定舉行英法意三頭會議、此舉當視爲英法意三國已結成聯合陣綫、同時亦未閉塞德國合作之門戶、一般人以爲西門外相聘問德國之舉、雖僅與英國有關、然英國此舉實担負重大之責任、其所得經騐足供各國政府之參考、至於法國申請國聯會一事、意國方面正與法國作密切之接洽、意國政府將於明日宣佈其觀點、惟聞對於申請國聯會之舉、當不至反對云、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英國三黨　對德意見分析　保守黨不無疑慮</h3>
<p>（倫敦）關於德國宣佈重整軍備、英政府送致德國照會事、本日將在下議院舉行辯論、茲據哈瓦斯社探得消息、大槪保守·自由·及勞工·三黨、對於政府致德照會內關於德國廢止凡爾塞和約軍事條欵一節、均可表示贊同、惟保守黨對於德國仍不無疑慮、該黨反政府派領袖前外長張伯倫氏、昨因政府於决定西門外相赴德之前、未向法意兩國先事洽商、本欲詆責政府、但嗣後聞悉英法意三國代表、將於本星期六日在巴黎舉行會議、保守黨反對派頗爲滿意、故張伯倫已决定不再指摘政府、自由黨反對派之態度、則可於其領袖薩繆爾爵士之意見覘之、該黨前聞德國恢復强迫微兵制、頗爲惶慮、嗣因德國答復英國照會、贊成英國閣員赴德自由黨反對派頗爲滿意、因此對於政府致德照會、將表示贊同、現該黨所最關懷者、卽巴黎會議中英法意三國是否能結成聯合陣綫、至于工黨反對派將由其領袖蘭斯拍雷發言、該黨對政府致德照會、表示滿意、惟對於若干點尚有疑慮、卽（一）英法意三國巴黎會議中、是否能聯絡一致、（二）政府是否將顧及尊重國際條約更甚于實際局勢、（三）英法宣言書所定程序、旣受限制、是否將减少成立協定之可能性、致使承自歐戰之各項問題、無法加以淸算是也、（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>羅斯福意響　亦擬對德抗議　惟爲內政牽制而審愼</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）關於德國重整軍備事、羅期福總統有向德國提出抗議之傾向、總統以爲此種表示、或可使歐洲時局嚴重、得以避免或延緩、惟羅斯福因內政之牽制、對於此舉又不能不十分審慎、蓋羅斯福之敵黨、恐將以爲此舉造成一種「先例」、致使美國將來捲入歐洲糾紛之漩渦、而藉此以攻擊總統也、因此一般人相信總統將俟歐洲政局稍見澄淸、尤其將俟英外相西門訪俄結果明瞭後、方作適當之處置云、（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美國可否發出抗議文、反對德國破壞凡爾賽和約之行爲、現猶在當局辯論中、但增進美國海陸兵力之計劃、則已趕緊編製、海軍事務委員長溫森今日聲稱、渠擬向衆院提議、（一）鞏固太平洋之根據地、（二）養成海軍充分人員、以供美國依照條約所許造齊各艦時之需用、（三）訓練充分飛行家以駕駛逐漸增多之飛機云、衆院軍事委員會主席羅傑已請衆院考慮在美國與阿拉斯加及巴拿馬等處設立航空根據地、並編成强盛陸軍之提案、政府中專家對於德國决定重整軍備之問題、意見不能一致、有數人以私人資格表示意見、以爲美政府宜認德國舉動爲不滿、外交顧問認美國有交涉理由、但聞當局方面甚欲置身事外、不陷入歐洲糾紛中、白宮聞亦主張美國不與聞海外任何糾葛、據今日此間消息、美國未必派旁聽員出席於星期六日在巴黎舉行英法意三國政治家會議、（二十日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）此間國際觀察者今日預料、要求收回戰前之屬地或將爲德國之第二步打動云、官方以爲德國所放棄之士地、包括現由日本代管之太平洋各島、德國若有此要求、將與日本有嚴重糾紛、外交界深信德國政府决擬恢復其往日之地位、故或將要求收回屬地、始能重返國聯、且於歐洲方面、希特勒或將要求在奧國及但澤自由市等處亦如薩爾區之辦法、舉行人民投票、羅斯福總統對於歐洲時局之情報、殊爲完全、彼與報界談話、曾謂美國對德將不送牒文、並以爲處此現狀之中、美國之「睦隣政策」或將成爲世界裁軍運動中之重要成份、總統最後表示、謂日內瓦之軍縮運動已大有成續、希望國聯對於此事能有確切之成就云、（二十日國民電）</p>
<h3>德國防部長表示　恢復戰前軍備　告人民爲國事作準備</h3>
<p>（柏林）國防部長白隆伯將軍今日在伏錫志波柏黑特報發表一論文、陳述德國此後厲行微兵制之途徑、蓋自德政府上星期六發表重要宣言以來、數百萬人對於此事已轉展相詢故也、白氏稱、「今後德國之普遍强迫軍役、將依據國社主義國家之原則施行」、所謂依據國社主義國家之原則而行之者、卽此後國防組織將恢復戰前之原有制度、因國家社會主義國家之瞻望係永久向前、義無反顧者也、故人民獲得高深教育之後、並不如以前之可以縮短其軍役、惟品性及成就始可决定每人個人之事業及價值、其詳細之解釋、已於「德國軍人職志」一書中備述之、白氏復稱、國家之防禦旣屬全民參加之大事、則將來之强盛及團結、實屬毫無疑意之事、今後人民心目中所潛在之力量與思想、將趨於一致而密切結合、故國防實力之效用雖在目前、但正屬為國家將來之功業、作一準備云、（二十日國民電）</p>
<h3>德國間牒工作　國社黨人混入瑞曲各黨</h3>
<p>瑞典京城　官廳頃在古登堡地方瑞典國社黨工人所設總機關內、大事搜查、據搜得文件函扎而觀、知國社黨設立該機關、專從事於秘密之間牒工作、以謀破壞敵黨者、觀於文件中所述、可知各黨派之中、皆有國社黨人員混跡其間、其所負之秘密工作、卽羅舉國社黨之敵黨人名、編爲「黑籍」名冊、又觀該機關與德國國社主義勞工組織往來函扎、卽可證明、德國國社黨蓋曾責成瑞典國社黨、使其爲德國國社黨執行政治間諜使命也、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>李頓勳爵　論俄日德關係　重視蘇俄加入國聯</h3>
<p>（倫敦）前國聯遠東事件調查團主任李頓爵士謂眞理報記者云、「齊心協作以謀和平、如無蘇聯參加、决不能達到目的、故予以爲蘇聯加入國聯爲一異常重要之事件、同時吾人不須忘却蘇聯能在軍縮大會合作、實極可貴也、蘇聯絕無侵略鄰國之計劃、實極顯明、日德兩國政治家之言論、明白表示日本圖向西方擴張、而德國則窺視東方、彼等正向貴國前進、日德此種反蘇聯結合、予極非難云、李維諾夫曾謂和平乃不容分割者、同時今日之戰爭均不能令其限於地方事件、此點予全部同意」李頓爵士復表示贊成建立一種有效的安全組織、彼於東方互歐公約特別贊成、因此舉如能實現、洵爲和平保障之一大勝利」云、（二十日塔斯電）</p>

<h3>美國對俄關係</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）自美俄債務談判失敗後、美國卽有人發起對俄絕交之運動、參衆二院皆已提出斷絕對俄關係之議案、國務院不以此舉爲然、其所持之理由、爲此乃總統職權內事、若此議案果被通過、則美俄關係將發生障碍、但發起此案者、置諸不理、國務總理赫爾今日乃聲稱、美國將繼績承認蘇俄、駐俄大使布立特刻請假在美、將於下星期內前往俄京回任云、大約布立特返俄後、將重開債務談判、但是否奉有特殊訓令、現尚未悉、（二十一日路透社電）</p>
<h3>蘇聯航空工業</h3>

<p>金銀</p>
<p>倫敦金價昨跌去一先令八便士半、似覺跌風過猛、今日英鎊既低、金價乃回起、而爲一百四十六先令十便士半、比昨高一先令四便士半、</p>
<p>倫敦銀市、亦有起色、昨日價跌、今日回漲、現貨爲二十七便士一八七五、漲〇六二五、期貨爲二十七便士三一二五、漲一二五、售出者少、中國購入、此爲價漲之原因、而英鎊疲弱、亦一因素、</p>
<p>滙兌</p>
<p>英美倫敦外滙市塲、今晨人氣恐慌、價格波動頻頻、但不甚劇烈、成交不多、英美匯價開盤、爲四元七角六分二五、比昨美英收盤低六二五、午前除一度微漲後、價格大都下降、午後二時價爲四元七角四分九三七五、比開盤低一分三二二五、</p>

<p>美英紐約外匯市塲、美英滙價開盤、爲四元七角六分一二五、比昨低七五、法滙則漲二五、而爲六元五角九分半、市塲中頗有恐慌氣象、蓋以歐洲時局混亂、致英鎊與金幣咸爲之不寗也、英滙未幾跌至四元七角六分、開盤後一小時內市價尚穩、</p>
<p>棉麥</p>
<p>紐約棉花農長華萊士宣佈政府棉產政策仍不改變、此說應有利於多方、但今日棉市竟未受良好影響、歐洲時局之不定、與外國之售出、乃棉市不佳之兩大因素、開盤價格雖高起數磅音、但未幾即降至昨日收盤價格之下、幸售出之數、多被吸收、故價格尚堪維持、外國操業者後乃稍稍買進、價遂微漲、同業講入尚屬不少、</p>
<p>芝加哥麥今日復有沙暴害之報告、而麥收又有荒歉之可能性、故農部雖取銷今年春麥之限制、然開盤價格尚能穩定、溫尼佩格因英鎊疲弱、及利物浦市價稍高、故漲起一二五、午前芝加哥麥市稍有人購進、但多係投機性質、</p>
<p>利物浦麥美國雖有取消春麥限制擾人消息、但今日利物浦麥市交易尚多、價格微漲、午後一時五月期價爲五先令一便士半、比昨漲半便士、</p>

<h3>濟南　發現古代銅器</h3>
<p>形如銅盆以手摩之能發聲噴水　經考古家多人研究竟莫明其理</p>
<p>濟南通信、山東爲齊魯古國、我國文化之發源地、金石古物時有發現、前年春間、滕縣發現西周銅器十三件、早已轟動全國、最近本市朱姓又有一古銅器、頗爲奇特、茲紀其形象奇蹟及來歷如下、</p>
<p>形狀及奇蹟</p>
<p>該器爲圓形、黃銅質、古色斑爛、大如普通而盆、高半尺許、外有鐘鼎文十三字、爲陽文、經考證後、其第一字爲周、最末一字爲弊、餘則不可辨識、外有兩耳、器底上有圓圈一個、圈外有扛五道、扛外鑄銅魚四尾、據物主云、圓圈爲象太極、五扛爲象五行、四魚象四象、兩耳象兩儀、最奇特者、貯水滿器、用兩手摩擦兩耳、則嗡嗡作響、器內之水亦起氣泡、如鼎沸、摩之愈久、則響聲愈大、且抑揚可聽、如奏鋼琴、同時器內銅魚嘴內噴水出水面、如摩擦老爲年精富壯之人、則噴水愈高、約二尺許、四股並立、煞是奇觀、若年老力衰者摩之、則實水較低、聲音亦小、</p>
<p>奇器之來歷</p>
<p>據聞該器發現甚早、淸代末年張季直在京主辦博覽會、各方奇異物品雜陳、此器卽曾在另一室內陳列、觀者莫不稱奇、究未明其理之所在、當時物主爲一軍人、現在物主爲朱姓、彼時亦服務軍界、見後頗爲注意、不久原物主作古、其家售與朱君、價值爲二三千元、朱君視若拱璧、携來濟南珍藏、不以示人、張宗昌在魯時、有人洩其事與張、張托人示意、欲委以某項職務以作交換、朱遂携器走天津、又爲褚玉璞所知、亦欲得之、任朱擇一事以爲交換、朱潛將該器存入銀行保險、隻身又往上海、埋名不出、而展轉奔波、用費已不貲矣、最近朱君經濟頗感拮据、遂有出賣之意、</p>
<p>各方之考證</p>
<p>主人初以爲奇貨可居、不肯輕以示人、索價五萬元、嗣經考古家省立圖書館長王獻唐斷定係宋元問物、最高不過唐朝、必非三代物、其字係後人偽造者、惟對其噴水與響聲、則終不解其理、因宋元時世界物理化學尚未大發明、决不能創造此物也、以前章太炎在上海辦國粹學報、其雜俎內曾對此物詳加研究、終未能有所發明、亦未確定其名稱、北平輔仁大學梭長陳遠菴爲考古名家、對古銅鑒別尤精、有人函請陳氏研究、陳覆函謂、其噴水與響聲、均係電之作用、該器銅質內、必含有傳電最快之一種金屬原質、人手有電、故摩擦之則傳電于水內、因而發聲噴水、不過現在科學昌明、尚未聞有人發明傳電如是迅速之金屬、而朱元時我國卽有人發明、殊堪驚人、如證明爲三代銅器、則更爲希世之珍、因其可寳賣者在我國三代時人、卽能利用電力而造此物也、陳函內幷謂、如該器上有缺陷地方、而內中發現紅銹者、卽可證明爲三代銅器、因如非三代銅器、則只有綠銹而無紅銹、記者細察該器實有缺陷地方、如豆粒大、內中確有紅銹、則或竟爲三代銅器、亦未可知、總之該器無論三代物非三代物、而確係宋元時代物、我國宋元時代人、竟能發現二十世紀尚未發現之傳電最快之金屬、且能利用之以造此器、于我國文化上實有重大之意義、而有研究之價值也、</p>
<p>無獨竟有偶</p>
<p>又最近本市外人設立之廣智院、亦新由河南購到與該銅器同樣之物、惟略小、以手摩擦之、亦能發聲噴水、惟聲音旣小、而噴水亦低、河南亦爲我國古代文化發源地、可見該物爲古物無疑、特誌此以供當代科學家之研究、</p>

<h3>財部爲救濟市面　發行一萬萬元公債</h3>
<p>充實三銀行資金間接救濟工商業　銀行小組會昨議定信用放欵辦法</p>
<p>新聲社云、關於救濟市面問題、財政部决發行金融公債一萬萬元、以充實三行資金、調劑市面、工商業信用放欵、銀行公會小組會、昨會議、决勸錢業公會加入、並郎籌設銀團以實施、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>發公債厚　三行資金</p>
<p>財政部爲救濟工商業、决定發行民國二十四年金融公債一萬萬元、以關餘爲擔保、已經中央政治會議通過、是項公債、已决定撥三千萬元充中央銀行資金、撥二千五百萬元、充中國銀行資金、撥一千萬元、充交通銀行資金、使三行資金增加、充實本身力量、以便流通金融、調劑市面、滬金融界對於財政部爲救濟市面而發行公債、充實三行資金、均表示贊成、俟實現後、則市面籌碼、可减少缺乏之恐怖、使工商業可漸恢復原狀、</p>
<p>三行拆放　救濟市面</p>
<p>中央·中國·交通·三銀行、於民國二十三年總結賬時、爲救濟市面、指定鉅欵、備銀錢兩業抵押拆放之用、迄仍繼績辦理、惟總額在千萬元以下、今該三行决俟一萬元金融公債發行後、卽再增加鉅欵、備銀錢兩業抵押拆放之用、直接雖爲拆放與銀錢兩業、間接實爲拆放與工商業、因銀錢兩業得欵後、則本身力量充厚、對工商業放欵力量、亦隨增加、</p>
<p>銀行小組　會昨開會</p>
<p>工商業信用小借欵五百萬元案、銀行業同業公會所組之小組會、於昨日下午二時、在香港路該會、開第一次會議、到委員陳光甫·唐壽民·貝淞蓀·葉扶霄·徐寄庼·王延松·等六人、列席者公會秘書長林康候·各委員均認爲工商業信用小放欵應迅予實施、以資救濟、當卽議决、（一）函勸錢業同業公會會員錢莊、仍舊酌量加大、以資合作、否則由會員銀行如數分認之、（二）卽日籌組工商業信用小放欽銀團、務求早日舉行、（三）辦法、凡聲請者、先塡三聯之聲請書、送地方協會及市商會核準後、再送銀團審查合格、卽指定會員銀行付欵、至下午三時始散、</p>
<p>放欵銀團　進行籌設</p>
<p>新聲社記者、昨向銀錢業探悉、錢業同業公會對工商業信用小借欵案、經臨時會員代表大會議决母庸加入銀團後、今已勸告會員錢莊儘量擴充放欵、對於銀行公會小組會議决之勸加入銀團案、及至昨晚截止、尚未接到來函、俟接函後、再提交執行委員會討論、至於銀行業同業公會對工商業信用小放欵案、决卽會同政府之中央銀行籌設、總額爲五百萬元、中央銀行擔任二百五十萬元、該會會員銀行、共任二百五十萬元、如錢業公會會員錢莊、能擔任一部份、則爲最好云、</p>

<h3>潘仰堯談話</h3>
<p>工商業衰落情形</p>
<p>據查不如市傳之甚　最大原因不外三點</p>
<p>中央社云、本市工商業日趨衰落、籲請設法救濟、財政部爲救濟計、業已提請中政會通過、發行金融公債一萬萬元、同時本市銀行界、亦將會同財部合資五百萬元、放欵救濟、中央社記者、爲明瞭本市工商業衰落狀况起見、昨晨特走訪熟悉本市工商業之潘仰堯、據潘氏調查所得、認本市工商業之衰落、不如市上所傳之甚、愛誌各情如次、</p>
<p>衰落情形</p>
<p>據潘氏云、際茲不景氣時代、本市工商業之哀落、本屬意中之事、初非工商業爲然、百業均呈斯狀態、工商業衰落情形、最近市傳云云、實屬過甚其辭、據本人調查所知、不敢盡信所傳爲確訊也、統查全市工商業、最近營業確況、（小商舖因種種原因、一時無法調查、）計百分之四十以上　餘、百分之三十可得官利、其餘賠本、此種情形、與市傳實屬不符、但再不立加救濟、則工商業前途、將不堪設想、所以財政當局以及本市金融界、均將予以實力上之欵濟也、</p>
<p>最大原因</p>
<p>至於工商業衰落、雖原因不一、其最著者不外三點、第一點、利息微薄、按照金城銀行本市物價統計、去年物價、較前年低跌百分之十至十六、物價低跌、利息當然微薄、第二點、存貨堆積、年來市上購買力薄弱、故存貨堆積如山、擱起一部份成本、貨物出後、放給商人、一時不能收到貨欵、又擱起一部份成本、同時原料之購進、又須擱起一部份成本、第三點、同業競爭、最近同業競爭日甚、每致賣價跌至成本以下、工商業處於此種層層痛苦之中、遂日趨衰落矣、</p>
<p>設法救濟</p>
<p>工商業中人士、對於此種層層痛苦、已逐漸明白、現正極力設法救濟、對於同業競爭一點、更表痛心、所以一部份工商業領袖、已數度會商、羣認欲免除同業競爭、當先知悉該業貨物之銷數與產數、自相限制、俾產數適合於銷數、則可免存貨堆積、同時將同業自相競爭之雄心、一致與外貨相競爭、則一切流弊可以免除、</p>
<p>廠家貸款</p>
<p>銀錢業爲自己利益計、對於工商業之放欵、當然須加以審愼、於資本週轉不靈之工商業、益感困難、該業中人已有主張組織團體向銀錢界貸欵、惟何時能實行、尚難預悉、其辦法例如聯合十餘家廠家組織一貸欵團、向銀錢界貸欵若干、該團中如有一家廠家倒閉、或不能還欵、該欠欵由其餘各廠家、共同負責賠償、如此、銀錢界向工商界放欵、可以安心、而工商業經濟、亦可藉以靈活矣云云</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （楊餘聲）</p>
<p>「置　喙」是日本外交家常用的一句“Phrase”；要是用中國的通俗話來講，和「挿嘴」的意義是相合的。</p>
<p>照例，外交家的口中是聽不到“Yes”或是No。的！因爲他們的措詞都在圓滑上用功夫，但日本的外交家魷率直得多，在運用「置喙」這句“Phrase”的時候，它的上面老是聯緊着「不容」這兩個字，意思是警告對方「不要多嘴」！和英文的“Shut　Up”同一意義，不過沒有後者那種「怒氣勃勃」罷了！</p>
<p>前天在路上看到三四個無賴抓着個「鄉曲」在痛打，四週沉靜的旁觀人羣中居然有人出來打不平！無賴瞪着眼賞他一個「滾蛋」！大有「不容置喙」的氣燄！</p>
<p>因此想到上帝製造人類，爲什麼耳，眼，手足，都得成雙，而嘴却祇有一張！人類本不應該多嘴的呀！</p>
<h3>流線型</h3>
<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>曲綫，除了娘兒們的姣軀的輸廓之外，是早已沒人瞧得入眼的了。立體式，也逐漸地被一般人所遺忘了。據說，「流綫型」，才是一九三五年式的。</p>
<p>因此，一九三五年式的飛機，火車，摩托車，都是流綫型的了。自然，這是很合理的，因爲流綫型的，遇到暴風的襲擊，可减少被侵害的危險，在良好的天氣中，也可以减少些兒空氣壓迫的阻力，而增加着些兒前進的速度。</p>
<p>於是我意識到了今年的建築物，也許將漸趨流綫化、在沙漠地裏的蒙古包，在熱　區域裏的椰子葉和　梠葉，蓋的中國墳墓式的屋子，或許將成爲一九三五式的建築物的良好的模型了。</p>
<p>自然，這是不限於建築物是如此，就是傢具用器，今年，我想，聰明的設計者，總也會由立體式的，蛻化而成沒有角兒，但也不是從前所流行過的多曲綫式的，而造成一九三五年式的流綫型的，以供摩登家庭的購置。</p>
<p>瞧哪，大商店裏的櫥窗佈置，今年已不怎麼瞧得見立體式的了。就是整疋的綢布，也都用流綫型的展覽法，以吸引行人們駐足而觀了。</p>
<p>在物質方面，是流綫化，在精神方面，我想，今年或許也將日趨流綫化。立體式的端方正直的性格兒，是不吃香了。說出話來，幹出事來，沒有角兒會碰人，也沒有角兒給人扳住的，才能算是流綫型兒的，站在時代前面的不落伍者</p>
<h3>香豔的萬里橋</h3>
<p>— 田舍翁</p>
<p>前見本欄盧笳君所作『萬里橋』，說橋在河南商城縣，用石塊築成，共長十八里。橋上有四個小茶亭，供行人息脚，可知這橋的長了。橋上只有羊角小車，可以代步。盧笳君沒有說出別的名勝艷蹟。</p>
<p>咱記得胡曾贈唐名妓薛濤詩道：「萬里橋邊女校書，枇杷花下閉門居；掃眉才子知多少，管領春風總不如」！薛濤是蜀中名妓，伊的香巢，明明築在萬里橋邊，這萬里橋當然不是在河南了。譬如洛陽橋不在河南的洛陽，而在福建的惠家。天津橋不在河北的天津，而在河南的洛陽。地以人名，四川的萬里橋，總比河南的有名吧。</p>
<p>考四川的萬里橋，在華陽縣南。名勝志說：「蜀使費褘聘吳，諸葛亮祖之。歡曰：萬里之行，始於今日，故名」。可知這座萬里橋，並不是因橋長得名了。</p>
<p>唐代詩人杜甫的草堂，便在萬里橋的西邊。杜詩有句道「萬里橋西一草堂」。唐名妓薛濤，也任過萬里橋邊，所以有胡曾「萬里橋邊女校書」的句了。</p>
<h3>放紙鳶</h3>
<p>— 春雨樓主</p>
<p>在春的季節中，最適體的運動，莫過於放紙鳶了。可是放紙鳶，並不是兒童們專嗜的玩意兒；就是成年的人，也有很多的人，樂此不疲。江南一帶，差不多都流行的，尤其是常州無錫兩處喜歡的人更多。</p>
<p>去年春季，我打從南京乘坐平滬通車到蘇州，路過常州無錫，從車廂裏的窗上，透視墨黑的野外，黑暗的天空，竟有長蛇似的閃閃爍爍的鷂燈在浮動会。這樣怪有趣的玩意兒，不是成年人幹的嗎？</p>
<p>在日間，我們到郊野去散步，每每由駘蕩的春風送來幽揚悅耳的音調，這是很顯然的，是紙鳶上帶的　琴，不然，晴空裏是沒有這種音浪的。在這時，偕着素心人春遊郊外，踏着綠茵的軟草，晴和的春光映射在身上，不妨唱一隻「春之曲」，來襯托醉人的春光。</p>
<p>前天接到常州一個友人函，約赴紙鳶比賽，我就用茅草心爲骨，紅絹爲皮，製成了一隻很精巧的星鳶，用細絲綫放縱，一定能博得好評的。不久，就想帶往比賽，可是我們四安，也在作紙鳶比賽呢，定期三月十六日，一般嗜好紙鳶的朋友，當然拿了各式不同的紙鳶來參加，天空中一時點綴得非常美麗！</p>
<h3>植樹節</h3>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>賈多才笑道：你的話，不向下說，我也明白了，大槪就是在陪人燒燒烟打打牌之外，還有些別的事情。那麼，你也應該掙下幾個錢了，爲什麼窮得做出這種事來。楊浣花道：嗐！這實在是我自己該死。因爲陪人家燒烟，可以抽不花錢的烟，糊裏糊塗的，我也就上了癮了。本來我心裏就十分難受，對人家說笑，都是勉强的。這種日子，比挨打挨駡還難過，到了去年秋天自己就鬧上了滿身的暗病，臉上把烟一熏，更不好看了。一個月之內，也難碰到幾回肯買我身體的人。譬如上次，李先生介紹我和賈先生見面，我那樣將就，賈先生都不要我，那不是一個明證？今天，也是有人在隔壁開了房間，呌我來的。他看不中意，同我燒了一會子烟，先走了。我想房錢是巳經付了，落得在這裏睡上一晚，再等一點機會。不料無意之中，在壁縫裏看到你那注錢。我沒有飯吃，沒有烟燒，還不要緊，只是我有個胸口疼的毛病，三四天作一次，實在忍受不住了。我在這南邊小巷子裏，本地人家要，租了一問房住，爲的是省幾個錢，但是也就太不方便，什麼事都是自己一個人幹，我這病發作起來，誰來伺候我？就只有等死。而且那房東，他們也不願租我住了。我眞想找幾個錢治病，能多找幾個錢逃同河南去，那更是好。我在壁縫裏看到你放在桌上的錢，那實在够我花着回家的了。假如我做一回賊，能偷了這些錢回家去改過自新，不也是一條好計策嗎？我知道你是不在乎這幾個錢的，所以下手來拿，若是窮人，我也不肯動的呀。不過，我總是對先生不起的，你要怎樣辦我，我都願意。我就剩這條身子，先生！說着，他又哽着着哭了。（一六三）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>「現在巳經是蠶兒吐絲作蘭的時候了！」有一天早上，太后又想到了伊所蓄着的春蠶，便引着我們，一起再去參觀。當伊老人家在向我們滔滔地講論的時候，那些育蠶的姑娘們正在忙着工作咧！在這些日子裏，伊們確然是很忙的；但一年中其餘的日子，伊們却都可飽食無事，在園內高臥了。「我們這裏是和外間不同的！尋常人家，大都把乾柴紥成了短短的一束，就把快要吐絲的蠶捉上去，讓它們作起　來；這種法子所得的絲，往往不很光潔。所以我們是用特製的小匣子的，每一匣裝四條蠶。」太后用手指着那邊疊得很高的許多紙厘子，繼績向我說道：「它們進去之後，便自會各據一角，不相侵犯地做起　子來。你不信可以時常來看！」</p>
<p>我當眞服從了伊的話，從此越發的常來看了。這是果然很有趣的！大凡一條蠶特將到吐絲的時侯，便不再吃桑葉了，好像是已經吃得太飽；這時候它的身子已很粗很長了，而且已變爲一種透明的顏色，於是那些育蠶的女孩子們便輕輕地把它們分別納入那些小匣子中去，每匣四條，蓋上了匣蓋平放着，讓它們努力作起　來。大槪經過了五六天工夫，打開匣子看時，四個白色或金黃色的繭子，已在匣子的四角上端端正正地結好了。不過據說一匣子四條蠶，必須是同一顏色的，要是有三條是白的，一條是黃的，那一條黃的結了一半，便决不肯再結了；所以必須預先鑒別好，不能混亂的。（二七四）</p>
<h3>捷徑</h3>
<p>— 餘聲</p>
<p>晚間，進澡堂，脫衣，洗澡。浴罷，穿衣，回家，再脫衣，睡覺。何不在浴後直接用汽車搬回自己床上！</p>
<p>紗廠裏，在軋花，紡紗，搖紗，打包，出賣。織布廠却在拆包，施漿，上機。何不搖紗後直接賣給布廠！</p>
<p>這些本是笑話，但中國人做事，轉灣委實太多！不肯走捷徑，所以老是趕不上人家！</p>
<p>游踪所至</p>
<h3>三島看櫻</h3>
<p>— 恂子</p>
<p>陣陣的東南風，帶來了春的消息，春天眞是出遊的季節；鄧尉的梅花，龍華的桃花，先後掬着笑黶，供人們的賞玩。更有比梅花開的晚一些，比桃花早一些，教遊人見了，徘徊流連而不忍遽去的，那便是三島的櫻花！</p>
<p>櫻花是日本的國花，每逢盛開的季節，眞是舉國若狂；工廠學校，一律放假，述警察的帽子上，也都戴着一朶紙製的假櫻花。街上跑路，兩脚如寫字般，口中嗚嗚有聲哼着歌曲的，那便是看櫻花回來的醉漢；看花必須喝酒，中國古時有個「不醉母歸」的山濤，在日本，櫻花季節，到處都有搭着盧蓆棚的臨時酒家，工人們會把辛苦了一個月儲積下來的錢都換了酒，在櫻花樹下喝個酩酊大醉；不出日本的工人，倒懂得「人生藝術」。</p>
<p>在「嫩寒未褪」的二月下句，人們坐在蓆子上，還元是有些手指頭痛，不得不仲手過去向大鉢上烘着；可是朝日新聞每日新聞之類，巳是慢俊價在提醒讀者，說是「花之季節要到來了」。因爲櫻花是日本的國花，所以在三島，一個「花」字，便可以代表櫻花。偶然上野公園一株早熟的櫻花，同伴們還不會感覺到「春的恩惠」時，他却「趕早市」先在枝頭吐出兩三顆蓓蕾來；那事情可就鬧大啦！一般新聞紙的攝影記者，你也拎着攝影機，我也掮着三脚架，爭着往上野去替蓓蕾拍照，一會兒早報或是晚報，便把照相印了出來，更自有好事的人看了報，會跑到上野去「按圖索驥」。</p>
<p>除掉上野公園的櫻花，在東京很著名以外，還有飛烏山，也是賞玩櫻花的所在。飛烏山在東京市外，坐電車瞬息可達，山並不甚高，和蘇州的虎邱差不多，除掉櫻花，便沒有甚麼可玩了。可是日本人點綴天然的風景很有手腕，他們漫山徧野，種的全是櫻花，教遊人們從山脚到山巔，全在櫻花樹底下走路，每一段路走盡，便有蘆蓆棚蓋的臨時酒店茶店咖啡館餐館。遊人們除穿了花花綠綠的花衣服，來實行「衣錦畫行」外；更有奇形怪狀的化妝男女，臉上如同中國舊劇裏一般，畫着花臉，也有戴着假而具的，大家實行「狂歡」兩字的。</p>

<h3>章友三何炳松解釋　中國本位文化意義</h3>
<p>自十敎授發表一十宣言、引起國人之後、全國學者羣起討論、熱烈程度、頗有與時俱進之勢、唯一般人對於文化及中國本位文化之意義、見解頗不一致、同時並有以爲一十宣言之主張與中學爲體西學爲用」之主張完全相同者、因此一十宣言之署名人、每遇被邀請演文化建設問題時、對於文化之定義、及中國本位文化興中體西用主張之異同、莫不努力解釋、冀一般人亦能得一切實之認識、茲特錄章友三何炳松二氏在光華大學及中華職敎社之演辭要點如左、以餉留心文化建設運動之人士、</p>
<p>章友三之中國本位觀　章益氏昨應光華大學之請、作公閒演講、講題爲「中學爲體西學爲用對嗎、對於此種主張之不足以融會中西、發揮至爲詳盡、章氏演講大意、謂兼採中西、分混合於化合兩種、中學爲體西學爲用只是混合、而皆所需者則爲化合、且化合作用亦必預作準備、不能聽其任意進行、具體說來、必須兼採中國克己的精神與四洋之科學、方能創造中國的新文化云、</p>
<p>何炳松在職敎社講演　日昨本埠中華職業敎育社、特請署名「一十宣言」之何炳松氏、公開演講「文化與建設文化的標準問題」、聽者甚衆、座爲之滿、先由該社辦事主任楊衛玉氏主席致介紹詞、繼由何氏登台演講、歷一時餘、發揮盡致、聽者無不動容、何氏先聲明他的演講、完全代表十位同志的意思、不過如有錯誤之處、則應山渠一人負責、並希望大家指正、次謂所謂文化就是人類適應環境以求生活改善的成果、其中含有努力奮鬭和繼續進步等意思、詳言之、文化就是人類爲要求生活的改進、對於艱難困苦的環境、努力奮　、以底於成的結果、古人所說日新又新、止於至善、就是這個意思、十位同志所以要發表「一十宣言」、是因爲他們一面感覺到本國固有的文化、衡以現代標準、巳不適用、而西洋的文化、衡以中國的標準、又不合宜、弄得我們這個魯殿靈光的古文明國、陳不能推、新不能出、載沉載浮於靑黃不接之境、同時又鑒於近百年來的中國、深受帝國主義的壓迫、弄得我們這個泱泱大國、內則民生憔瘁、外則四面楚歌、歷四千餘年的民族生存、幾有朝不保夕之勢、似非急起另闢途徑、不足以救亡圖存、因此就本匹夫有責之義、提出一種意見、請求國人指敎、十位同志以爲要建設中國本位的文化、旣要不守舊、又要不盲從、必須先認淸中國此時此地的需要、中國現在最迫切的需要、莫過於（一）充實人民的生活、（二）扶植社會的生存、（三）發展國民的生計、（四）延續民族的生命、所以不論固有的或外來的文化、凡是適合上述各項需要的、我們都應加以保存和介紹、否則應加以排斥、所以這四項需要、就是我們建設本位文化的標準、何氏最後並下一結論、謂人類進步實無止境、建設文化的終極目的、在於造成健全的個人、以組成健全的社會、至於怎樣去達到這個境界、因爲時間關係、而且不在講題範圍之內、所以不能詳述云云、</p>

<h3>糧食　粉麥爲春雪齊漲</h3>
<p>—洋麥又復上升</p>
<p>粉　市上午開盤後、各月份一致呈激漲之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥漲七八角之巨、坎拿大漲一角零、當開價後、以洋麥報漲頗巨、更因天時劇變、北路均見春雪、照歷來習慣、似乎與小麥收成、大有影響、是以人心激昂、買戶大暢、一部分之浮空、又盡力抵補、故近期漲起二分零、遠期漲度達三四分、此種情形、殆完全受天時所激動也、迨至下午開盤、各月份交易、仍見暢旺、惟趨勢則逐步和緩、以天已放晴、幷有一部分多頭回出、較上午回落近分、觀察後步、以天時變幻難測、又洋麥有加價之運動、後去恐尚有變化也、結果本月份較漲一分七厘半、四月份漲二分、五月份漲二分二厘半、六月份漲三分、七月份漲二分半、八月份漲二分、</p>
<p>麥　市上午開盤後、各月份大致呈穩固之態、以洋麥報價、芝加哥漲七八角不等、坎拿大漲二角零、當開價時、以洋麥之報漲、各地又有春雪、是以開價後、各月份買氣較盛、價亦上漲三五分、惟以現洋麥到貨茶暢、人心終有顧慮、故漲度亦覺有限也、迨至下午開盤、交易巳轉淸淡、做開無多、價亦上落無幾、照此種情形、恐無過漲之勢也、結果七月份漲三分、八月份漲三分、本月份上午漲六分、下午未開、現麥因客戶報價、故無做開、</p>

<h3>天寒杜洋米一致回好</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨客帮來源見稀、紙共到十一二號、（貨共二千餘石）因天氣驟寒、人心遂能轉平、而銷塲頗覺活動、包胃有天津烟臺兩帮辦一千餘包、故各厚粳次薄稻價悉轉定局、且形勢尚帶緊色、杜尖無甚榮辱、陰元則垂軟近角、</p>
<p>（滬北）近因虞姬墩河道被石子船軋斷數日、未能通行、致各帮來源日見稀少、市上銷路雖不佳因到貨寥寥、故市價白粳提升一角、變元及客元亦見緊俏、餘貨定局、惟早薄稻銷塲懈淡、價仍疲勢、</p>
<p>（洋米）昨日洋米市况、初以連日到頭不絕、囤販心思搖動、市價似有趨落之必要、乃昨晨開市後、忽被天寒有損農產之影響、人心頓時向上、現洋米雖到存兩旺、然昨日本客辦胃復貪、內地尤比本街爲活、而南京復起辦裝、均予市面轉機之機會、祇因一部份行囤求脫、各米均居平穩而巳、惟期貨有本街內地長江各帮問訊、新交易早經截止、囤貨回籠隨爲扳俏、售開三四月份西貢長粒圓等五百噸、長粒漲三五分、圓粒漲七八分、後形仍堅、現米共開一萬二千多包、多數爲江浙內地辦去、客秈存底不多、昨由本街辦去機紅及糙米四百多包、市亦微俏云、</p>
<h3>油廠黃豆銷化不懈</h3>
<p>昨日黃豆市況、比上日續見穩定、因油廠辦胃尚勁、市塲中人心平定、昨計成交大連四平街豆十一車、價扯　元零三分、歸德豆三千包、價爲三元七角半及七角、全河豆三車、價爲三元六角七及六角半、蚌埠豆三車價爲三元三角半三角、毫州豆一車、價爲三元四角二、碭山豆五百包、價爲三元六角半、漢口車豆二千包、價爲三元三角二分半、本街及內地等辦去漢口乍豆一千餘包、價目三元四角七至二角半、</p>
<h3>南北貨　青島生紅市價重振</h3>
<p>前昨步升八角半</p>
<p>生紅市面、因靑島電訊前昨兩日疊脫八角半、故趨勢轉緊、較高之貨均觀望、未肯脫手、惟普通貨仍有續開、計汕頭帮辦去一千數百包、歸德紅爲五元六角至六角半、碭山紅五元半至五角半、次莊五元三角半、比前盤回升角半、</p>
<h3>糖市　枝洋白續開一批　價已低廉後防回升</h3>
<p>昨日糖市、趨勢復現平疲之象、公會劃盤、二四組砂白呌十六元七角半、原盤未成交、轉口貨四元七角二分、比降三分、稍有成交、又廿五日可進口之荷粗白劃四元六角八分、法國粗砂白四元六角、各成交數百包、本廠綿白市勢略振、呌升五分、潮帮號家續開枝洋白一批、共計四五百包、價爲十二元五角、次照减、據其他號方意見、此價已屬低盤、故手存之貨、不肯續卸、</p>
<h3>五金　茶帮購定遠期青鉛</h3>
<p>茶帮近來對於靑鉛去路、巳有動情、故連日成交、頗可觀也、惟目今海外定價、步步高陞、而先令美滙又不放長、是以來日行情、恐防再漲、因此茶帮及廠家用戶、良恐漲風復熾、是以多紛紛下手購定遠期定貨、查昨市成交達二千餘條之多、聞成交價每擔爲十三元七角半、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>平常的話</h3>
<p>— 稜磨</p>
<p>科學是善於處分類別的，依照生理學，很容易把一個生　列爲雌性，雄性，及其他門類，但一般社會，缺少科學知識，且卽使有了，對於社會事件，是否就能改用科學方法去處理，也很難說。習慣上，我們覺得性別只有兩種，於是凡一個人走到社會以後，勢必非Ａ卽Ｂ，因爲事實上例外是很少的，於是這簡單類別依舊維持下去，沒有人覺得可持異議。因爲無可異議，不幸生而爲例外的就不願明白說出，因而這樣例外究有多少，是不得而知，但比通常所能想像到的數目，怕總要多些。也許在我們能知道一個數目之後，我們不會再爲偶然勢須揭露的例外感到驚奇了。我們每每會爲這樣的事情驚奇，是我們的不幸，而那被驚奇的人和事，其不幸尤甚。</p>
<p>在筆記小說中，常記有男轉爲女，女轉爲男的事，其記載的正確性或正確程度，我們無須注意，其對這兩種情形的看法，却是値注意的。不幸男轉爲女，往往視爲人妖或是由於寃孽；至於女轉爲男，則每稱其先人有陰德了。因爲社會對於這兩情形的看法不同，一般人對於屬性不明的嬰孩、若是還願留養時，爲防止其將來不幸遭逢，多寧願暫假定其爲女性。爲孩子着想是如此，爲他們自己着想呢，認爲女子，最大的麻煩，不過其長大了不能嫁人，須養之終老，若認爲男子，則在舊社會內，財產，事業，都有種種麻煩，或甚至有意外的危險。這樣被視爲女性撫養的例外的孩子，如果長火後果眞是傾向於女性的，也就不大生問題，且有甚至嫁給人家，而夫家也把問題隱壓下去的。如果長大了而傾向男性，則其不幸乃不可避免。其中極少數顯著到似一般所認的男性，正式改轉爲男，比較固已最幸運，但那决定他的過去的命運的迄今尚未消失的社會心理，仍會以難堪的陰影罩着他的。</p>
<p>近代的思想家在其兩性觀上每相信將來會有一種精神上的中性人物。這也並不是什麽新奇的理論。由最古的宗敎家到最近的學問家，有很多相信原始之慾的節制，有助於事業的成就。雖然有許多理論申論强制絕慾有許多流弊，但過去許多孤寂生活者的成就，也證明流弊並非必有，至少以所失易所得是値得的。生理變態的人自然也一樣有原始之慾，而這每使人覺其可致不正常的生活，可是他如在精神生活方面有發展的希望，一定是極願努力的。我們雖不定能希望其成就一定在平常的人之上，總可斷定他能與平常的人相同，而並無異樣。大槪退去學術，藝術的成就中，或者並不少這一類人的成績，他們僥倖不爲人所知，乃能享受其安靜的生活而有所成就。</p>
<p>誠然，現在的社會，與從前不同，女子的地位，與男子一樣，一個生理變態的人，對於其性屬，無須和從前一樣多所顧忌，也就不會有宣布的必要，以致使大家感着驚奇。不過我們是否已實際進步到這樣，似頗難說。而且要以不被人知道避免驚奇，總還是把這類事當作不平常的。其實生理上的一點特異，在研究生理者實巳熟知，此外一切旣和平常人一樣平常，我們是該讓他能像平常人一樣地表現於社會上的。</p>
<h3>舟過魯河</h3>
<p>— 斐兒</p>
<p>黏滯在魯河西岸的歲月有如蒼蠅黏滯着蜜餞：心兒旣被黏得膩膩地覺得異常厭煩，而神經也被長年炎熱的懶惰氣息悶得有點麻癢。眼看着悠悠的靑春遭受侵蝕，而生命的精力恐會從此斵喪。一到林君提議做異地之旅行，死水的心情便活潑得泛起了微波。</p>
<p>於是一只舢板被擺在河中。携了一只小小的手提箱，歡躍地跳入河心里。</p>
<p>魯河兩岸的叢林被明朗的日光所輝耀，大地發出了生命的歡笑。魯河的河水潺潺地向海奔流，生命是無停止的活躍。在河的轉角，潮水激起了微喘，打起漩渦。看圓頭的魚兒每每伸出頭來向水面呼氣，一被槳影所映射，便突然又下沉。這世界的呼吸是多麽地困難，我與魚兒深心實有同感。</p>
<p>岸上捉魚人的草寮里不住地一吐着灰黑色的炊烟。舢板傍着岸走的時候，一陣熟魚蝦的香味每被聞到。熟識的漁夫每每打着招呼，人間似乎也充滿着暖意。漁人們的板橋長長地伸入河床，成載的魚蝦一挑挑被挑進寮里。一陣收穫後的歡笑掛在漁人的嘴角，勞力顯出了有了報償。</p>
<p>船夫是個四十餘歲的馬來人，同船的是他的妻子和一個五六歲的女孩子。在舟中，他們家庭問的和平的和甜蜜的娓娓的言談常常使我神往。小孩子在棕色的臉孔上泛起了紅霞，活潑天眞的態度令人心愛。林君不住地讚美着馬來人的生活形態；我如果不是現代的中國人，我想我也願意長大在椰林子里。</p>
<p>西方的太陽照着濁紅色的河水，一把傘遮住了我們兩個。廣闊的河心常常吹來了熱帶的微風，河水被搧起了一圈圈的漣漪。</p>
<p>一陣麻癢癢的感覺從我的神經爬過，我的心兒感到有點迷茫。漂泊的滋味永恒囋到，生命像被裝滿了苦辣的辣椒，或香醇的舊酒滋味。</p>
<p>幾點鐘的水程在魯河上打了幾個轉灣，遲鈍的行程充滿着馬來人的碎語。讓微微的汗濕透過了白色的薄衣；馬來人的船夫神秘地用着我領下的一顆小黑痣來斷定我一生的命運。</p>
<p>竭力把生命的創傷用微笑遮蓋着，我望着偉大的自然風物，凝視着悠遠而未知的將來。哲理會被狹隘的心胸所拘束，而銳利的眼光却可穿過雲天，望見西方血紅的霧彩。</p>
<p>天空固然明朗得只有幾朶薄薄的白雲，而紅了一角西犬，太陽却歡悅地跟着朵朶的紅霧。</p>
<p>一轉眼問魯河的關口巳顯現在眼前，一間矮小的灰黑屋子已經露出在一個突出的地　上面。那後面排列着一小行的屋子，在陽光下閃出了白光。</p>
<p>一只小輪船剛從河口慢慢地駛進來，預備椗泊在河心。馬來孩子突然從小口中喊出了中國話：</p>
<p>「船來了！船來了！」</p>
<p>於是拍起了輕而薄的小手，在舢板上跳躍。</p>
<p>一陣心的愉樂也把我勾起來。小孩子的叫聲惹起了全船的歡笑。</p>
<p>踏上河岸，一陣迷茫的感覺便完全失掉了，而一個現實的影像便閃了上來。望着最近臨來的小旅程，幻想便像水花一般，爲上被現實壓碎了，像風吹抹去水的泡沫一樣。</p>

<p>每次都這麼答允着，但不一會，他又囑　嗦嗦說起來了，由瘴氣的妖精說到能在瘴氣裏而過日子的擺夷人，以及他們那些美貌的女子，又如何會在晚間變成貓頭　來抓人的故事。倘不是心裏對於瘴氣常是惴惴的話，一面聽一面走，也許是很有味道的。</p>
<p>因爲我走得快，他要加緊趕我，不久便聽不見他講話，只聞着他喘氣的聲昔了。我心裏高與地想：「看你還多嘴嘛！」走了好一會，他落在後面了，我以爲他又要喊道：</p>
<p>「等一等，不要那麽快！」</p>
<p>把「她在房籥口飛，像一隻衣白飛一般」的話，繼續說下去，但是並沒有，我好奇地掉回頭去看。</p>
<p>呀，他的臉色變得灰而且靑了，額上冒出大顆大顆的汗珠，鼻孔裏流出淡淡的淸水。</p>
<p>「老哥，你病了麽？」</p>
<p>我放緩了足步。</p>
<p>「唩說哪，是不是發了絞腸痧？」</p>
<p>他搖一搖頭，舉起微顫的手來，拭他額上的汗。</p>
<p>「莫非中瘴氣了麼？」</p>
<p>我惶恐地回顧：天在昏暗了，谷裏吐着霧。</p>
<p>路旁的林中小徑，　出一個人來把我嚇得一跳。</p>
<p>我的旅伴向他問了一句，他回答着，露出了一排黑色的牙齒。這時我才看淸了，他的肩上荷着一根鋤頭。而他倆一問一答的話，我却懂不得，大約就是說的夷人話吧。</p>
<p>我還在打量那個黑齒人的背影時，我的同伴便像恢復了好些原氣似的，掀一掀我的肩膀，說道：</p>
<p>「不要緊了，快走吧！」</p>
<p>一面扯着袖頭來措他的鼻子和額頭，極其用勁地走向我的頭前去。</p>
<p>「那是什麽人？夷人麽？」</p>
<p>「嗯，嗯。」</p>
<p>「喂我問你！那是不是夷人？」</p>
<p>「嗯，是的。」</p>
<p>「剛才你同他說什麼呢？」</p>
<p>「嗯，嗯。不要說話了，到店裏冉說吧！」</p>
<p>他現在似乎討厭我的嘮叨了，趕快用粗暴的聲音，截止着我的問話，迅速地加快着我的問話，迅速地加快着足步。</p>
<p>想着先前我催他，現在反而他催我的情形，我便不禁微笑起來了。</p>
<p>「我到以爲你剛才病了咧，看這樣子，還上得陣打得仗呢。」</p>
<p>他沒有答話，只顧走他的路。</p>
<p>轉過林子那邊，兩間竹片做壁的茅草房子，在　悶的和暮色中現了出來。門前晾着一竿小孩的衣褲。</p>
<p>我的旅伴朝茅屋走去，一面說道：</p>
<p>「在這裏息息，再趕路，這是一家擺夷人。」</p>
<p>不管我同意不同意，便掀開竹片編的門，鑽進去了。</p>
<p>我一面趕進去，一面埋怨他。</p>
<p>「天都要黑盡了，怎麼還担擱哪！」</p>
<p>屋裏黑暗暗的。一張點着烟燈的床，帶着黃色的微光，蹲在壁角落裏。我的旅伴就正睡在上面，眼睜睜地望那燈上炙着的烟泡子，—那是對面睡着的一個擺夷主人，簪他燒炙的。</p>
<p>一個頭上纏有尺來高黑布帕子的女人，讓我在一條板凳上坐時，我着急地想道。。我爲什麼待在這裏做瘴氣的犧牲品呢？看見我的旅伴舒適地長吸一口雅片烟之後，我用手拍了一下板凳，生氣地問道。。</p>
<p>「老哥，怎麽這樣糊塗，你忘記晚上有瘴氣出來麽？」</p>
<p>他却舉起烟槍來，揚了一揚，恢諧地說道：</p>
<p>「拿着這枝槍，我還怕他麽？」</p>
<p>我一聲不響地走出屋外去，在黑暗的路上邊走邊想着：同着這樣的中國人一塊走，眞是再倒霉不過的了。</p>
<h3>戰爭雜記（八）</h3>
<p>— 德永直作葉蔭譯</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>父親奏凱回來了。</p>
<p>幾乎是同時，姑丈也回來了。</p>
<p>在我們的附近，那相鄰的連房，正在慶祝凱旋，很是熱鬧。我的家裏也給大鼓和舊三　噪鬧了三天多。</p>
<p>兩個年頭沒有見面的父親，臉孔比以前更黑，更瘦削了。而且，總是一副恰到客人般的神情，對我們小孩子來得非常溫和。</p>
<p>父親穿着舊的黑花大褂，坐在客人們的正中，對那些溫和的村裏的客人們嘻嘻地笑着。在客人當中，了不起的人物也來到了。第一個就是村長。雖是只有一個鐘頭的樣子；但他是對惶恐着的父親說了許多話才回去的，如。：「有勞你了……」無論如何總是奏凱歸來了，恭喜你」「這也是皇上的威光所致」等等。以前連頭也不屑回過來的村人們，也特意說著率承話，跑來慶賀。惠美的祖父也跑來了。我不由的高興到了不得。</p>
<p>大約是在戰爭終止以後的半年間，曾有過種種慶祝凱旋的宴會。父親把我帶去，時常領到一些瓶裝的酒和貯在盒子裏面的食品回來。在那給供奉在本妙寺的加藤淸正公的神苑裏頭開開凱旋祝賀会的時候，我也會跟跟前懸掛着白色銅葉章和從軍徽章的父親一路去。當喝了酒紅着臉的女人們化裝做兵士，格啦格拉地拖着長劍，喊着「萬歲萬歲」闖進宴會的地方來的時候，那些捋着長髮的將校們也開顏大笑，把女人們摟抱過來。</p>
<p>從上頭發下了一百五十塊錢，獎給「勳八等，功八級」的父親。自從凱旋以來，並沒有怎樣替人家做短工的他，就拿那筆欵子做資本，開始架駛載貨馬車。原來沒有固定職業的父親，在打仗的時候學會了牽馬，這使他就開始做起那種生意來。</p>
<p>一天很運的夜裏，一條赤碣色的，獨限的老牝馬就給年輕時曾做過馬販子的外祖父和父親兩個人拉了來。並且，就在連房後面搭起窩棚，把巴關進去。</p>
<p>在戰爭以後還沒有經過一年的時光，那非常厲害的不景氣就來到了。開始做了載貨馬車生意的父親，沒有事做的日子就多了起來。</p>
<p>「什麽載貨馬車，還是不要幹好。每天沒有事做，馬和人都要吃的，怎能維持……」</p>
<p>母親時常都說着這樣的話，盤問父親。他自從凱旋以來，頭腦好像反而趕不上從前淸爽了。</p>
<p>「阿直，你去問問今天運不運貨。』</p>
<p>每逢給母親盤問的時候，老是沈默寡言的父親，就把我叫來，要我到益城號去問問「有沒有貨』。</p>
<p>在村尾的鄉鎭交界處的益城號，排列着幾十間白壁的米倉。市面好的時候，這裏的倉庫都是空空如也的，米都從倉裏頭搬了出去。幾百輛的載貨馬車排列着，發出雄壯的吆喝聲，以上熊本站和熊本站爲目的地，往復不絕。這握着肥後米，尤其是山鹿，菊池，大津，阿蘇的產米地咽喉的合本公司益城號的俞庫，有着米穀撿查所的分事務所和肥後銀行，飽託銀行的分行。</p>
<p>因爲我常去，所以對於那邊的情形很熟悉。從學校裏回家走過這倉庫前面的時候，我就時常都注意着，看看運不運貨，父親在不在那裏，而且能够自然地，間接地加以確定：這，巳經變成了我的習癖。</p>
<p>近來，運貨的日子很少了。可是，農家的產米量的狀態却一點也沒有變更。那五包，十包，還間着雜糧的莊稼漢們所運出來賣的米穀的數量，眞是驚人；光是在收穫前，就時常有着許許多多的兜售的米糧堆在倉庫的店面前。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>姚錦屏女化男身</h3>
<p>— 夏雲</p>
<p>原來如此　多此一舉</p>
<p>姚錦屏女化男身一事，消息傳來，不獨全國為之轟動，甚至歐美旅華人士，如法捕房警務總監費白氏，亦以一觀姚之本人為快，尤引起一般醫學界深切之注意，豈知現經海格路國立上海醫學院之檢騐結果，姚錦屏依然是女兒身，生理上絕對並沒有變態，一個疑團，完全大白，眞是滑稽之至。</p>
<p>我想姚錦屏之所以如此忽發奇想，作此狡猾，全係欲赴新疆尋父心切，第恐女性遠征，諸多不便，故不得已而出此，但當李杜將軍動議，送往國立上海醫學院檢騐之前，勢必圖窮而七首現，其時也應從實說出，省却許多麻煩，乃竟不出此，及經檢騐，原來如此，方明眞相，眞其愚不可及矣。</p>
<p>因此我想天下之事，可皆作如是觀者甚多，苟非親身目見，則凡希奇古怪的謠傳，均不足以置信，不過姚錦屏如此行動，雖云出於孝心，並為遠征便利起見，不得已而出此，但古來女扮男裝，或出外尋夫，或從事打仗，秘密化裝，私行察訪，這樣情形，原是我國小說中恒見的事，姚錦屏何必張大其辭，使全國轟然呢？此又理之所不可測者也。</p>
<p>並且近日報上所載，希奇古怪的事，原是層出不窮，例如虹口裏虹橋，大鼠奔馳財神　下，而財神廟突然坍倒，去年滬城大東門，因雷電交作，半空中掉下一大蛇，又漢口馬店民家，發現人面蜘蛛，又如某國發現睡美人，一睡二年又九個月，這都是奇怪的新聞，原是無從考證的，但是姚錦屏雖身為女子，謠諑紛來，大都注意，使李杜將軍，亦為好奇心所衝動，送院檢騐，豈知戲法無眞，當堂立破，非特李杜將軍所不及料，亦姚錦屏所不及料者也。</p>
<p>姚錦屏女化男身的目的，祇是一片孝心，遠征尋父，這樣一來，尋父計劃，完全失敗，但是我想因此而竟能達其尋父之目的，亦未可知，假定其父而尚在人間，必定有人以此事吿諸其父，其父自會有信通知現在住址所在，則姚錦屏不必再尋其父，而其父自會尋獲矣，如此則姚錦屏此種舉動，比登全張一年對面廣吿效力，更為偉大，此亦姚錦屏原來意想所不到者也。</p>
<h3>舊居</h3>
<p>— 羅漢</p>
<p>轉瞬間已是一年前的往事了。晶那時還在上海北郊的Ｋ女學裏讀書，我亦為着經濟的緣故，和她同住在學校旁近的一個小村落裏。</p>
<p>一條攸曲的靑水小河環繞着它，河上飄着許多載運貨物的船隻，四週圍是一眼望不盡漫靑的田野，叢綠的樹林，赭紅色淞滬小火車經過的時候，一片雲似的白烟，瀰漫在樹稍頭，被風刮到遠處，像一條活氣潑潑的銀龍。</p>
<p>村西的古剎裏，每到夕陽斜暉，便發出深沉而又低長的鐘聲，擁塞着羅馬</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>古風的情調。</p>
<p>我們的居處，便在沿河的一所朝南的黑房子裏。建築是中西合式，四週用矮竹籬笆圍繞着，上面佈滿了各色樣的薔薇花。門前是塊二畝來大的菜園，裏面種着應時的蔬菜，間雜着一點紅綠的野花。把那百葉玻璃窗打開，一陣輕風，吹進了野花的芬馨的香味。</p>
<p>房東是位極慈祥的老太太，丈夫在早年便去世了，剩下了一個兒子和兩個女兒，靠着些許的遺產，度生活。從她那斑白的蒼髮，縐紋的臉，知道她是吃過一些人生苦味的。</p>
<p>她的兩個女兒都己出嫁了，小兒子還在中學裏唸書，所以家裏格外的冷淸，同時因為了冷淸，更增加了她老人家對我們的好感。她信奉菩薩，每天唸經拜佛，許多的時間便消磨在這上面了。不過她亦時常的來和我們談談，吿訴我們她年靑時所經過的許多故事。洪楊造反經過的詳情，她都一一的給我們叙述過。</p>
<p>自然這樣房主人和着淸幽環境，我們感到十二分的滿意。那時我們眞再快樂沒有了。晶每天出去讀書，我每天出去做事。等到工畢閒暇的時候，我們便領着一羣法鄰居的孩子們做種種有趣的遊戲，敎他們唱歌，敎他們跳舞，有時更買許多水菓和他們一道吃。或者等到落日的時候，我們手拉手的到門外的兵上看那赤紅的一輪落日，慢慢的穿過了醬色的彩霞，向西山沉沒。聽古剎裏發出深沉而又攸長的鐘聲，我們忘却了一切的哀怨，我們忘却一切天地間煩惱瑣事。</p>
<p>可是好景不常，烟雲易散。片片薔薇的花瓣被凄凉的秋風吹落了，秋蟲開始哀怨的時候，晶為着事情，終於離開上海而和我遠別了。我懷着一顆孤獨的心情，當品走後，我亦從那淸幽的所在，搬到了上海。</p>
<p>現在又是春天，一個意外的機緣，我又從久別了的舊居經過，攸曲蜿蜓的小河，一眼望不盡漫靑的田野，叢綠的樹林，矮的竹籬笆包圍若的黑房子，茵綠色的草坪地，煦和的春風，迎逢着房東老太太慈愛的笑臉，一羣稚氣的小孩子，這一切，情景依舊。　居猶存，可惜故人已不復再在眼前了。</p>
<h3>命案</h3>
<p>— 明</p>
<p>金哥嫂自縊的消息傳到東村來已是午飯的時候了。</p>
<p>她哥哥福才是個沒頭腦的漢子，他見妹子歸寗的時候，由爹媽三番四次的勸說，才眼睛哭得像胡桃大似的回丈夫家去的。現在聽見妹子自縊吊死了，把飯碗猛地拋了丈遠，搶過屋角落里的鋤頭要替妹子報仇去。</p>
<p>報信的楚福才的大妹夫，和金哥家同住在西村的，淸早他就得了妻妹自盡的消息，但是金哥的母親竭力把這件事瞞藏起來。這老婆子是村上盡知的蠻婆，自金哥娶親後，婆媳之間不和睦是被誰都猜準了的；就是這老婆愛如珍寳的金哥兒也天天打駡起來，罪狀是有了老婆沒有了媽。據西村人的傳說，小夫妻倆和好才是像模樣兒，而金哥兒侍奉他的母親依是十分週到，並且處處規勸妻子耐性兒些。這一次金哥嫂歸寗回來，老婆子沒來由地打了媳婦兩巴掌，說是歸娘家偷漢子，兒子居中勸住，却手臂上被咬了兩口。早上金哥嫂就吊在柴房裏死了。</p>
<p>老婆子見惹了大禍，逼兄子把老婆埋了，假裝上岳家去迎妻子，好把責任推到娘家去。但是金哥兒沒有味了良心，母子兩個兒吵起嘴來才把這事情破露了。</p>
<p>福才的大妹夫趕了十多里路到東村來報信，他見福才惹了蠻勁，忙抓住了舅子的手說：「好好商量」。</p>
<p>結果是合家到西村去評理。</p>
<p>鄉村裏的嘴像風一般迅速，金哥家門前黑壓壓的圍住了許多人，在雜亂的聲音裏遠遠地就可以聽見「可死老婆子」！的大嗓子，但是始終維持着這騷擾的情形，沒有誰挺出身來解决這件命案。</p>
<p>金哥嫂娘家人趕到的時候，那羣人更是高聲地呌駡起來「打死老婆子」！一邊更是加緊地園攏去。</p>
<p>福才第一個冲進屋裏，彷彿一頭脫了羈絆的野牛，拖住老婆子一頓扭打，這是觀衆希望中的一齣好戲，雖是他爹媽，大妹夫竭力拉開，熱烈的家聲已像春雷似的轟着，自然間有喊好的。</p>
<p>老婆子躺在地下不肯起來，髮　披散了，就那樣如死了丈夫般地放聲大哭：「你們打人…好…我吿官去！」</p>
<p>金哥兒呆立在妻子屍身邊，沉着頭，他沒有看到這近乎瞧社戲一樣熱鬧的情形，他望着妻午慘白的臉，被矛盾的正義交戰着。然而老婆子愈哭愈兇，像一頭瘋狗，金哥嫂娘家的人反參進了觀衆的一羣不知所可了。</p>
<p>這悲喜劇一直哭吵到太陽西沉，才有一個聳着高高肩膀的地保排衆進來。他打起官話驅開了閒人，帶着有關係人上警察局去了。</p>
<p>這是我在某村親歷的實事，那結果是永遠不能使人相信的「判决無罪」—兩方面。</p>
<p>— 朱養晦作</p>
<p>「先生，你救救他吧，我只有這一個孩子咧！」</p>
<h3>西陵峽</h3>
<p>— 冰白</p>
<p>船過了宜昌南津關的時候，好像另外到了一個天地，兩岸的山便漸漸的窄狹起來，江水也不像以前那般平靜，一個浪頭追趕一個浪頭，轟隆轟隆地奔流着；而我們坐的這支小木船，活像一個笨猪，在江心裏左右不定的搖擺，幸好我們是到西陵峽來遊玩，不是有要事去趕路，否則，見着這船呆笨的情形，那眞是要急死人的。</p>
<p>這裏的山，好像要同天空比賽似的，一個高似一個；插在雲里，有時，在船上簡直看不着山頭，山嶺上堆着白雲，人也看不淸楚那是白雲，那是山嶺的。現在是三月的天氣，在江南，已是雜花生樹的時節了；可是，在這兒，風在峽里怒吼着，好像還在嚴冬似的；眼睛所看見的，沒有別的東西，前面是山，後面是山，左也是山，右也是山，連遼闊的天空都被山遮住了，只露出半臉向我們苦笑；我們是在山之國裏，摸索的前進哩。</p>
<p>「怎麽，要黑了嗎？太陽己經落了呢。」我奇怪地問着船伙。</p>
<p>「先生，早得很哩，太陽是被山頭遮沒了。」船伙笑着答我；我方知道水經注三峽中所說，「非停午夜分，不見明月。」並沒有說謊在旁的地方的人曦每天要看十二小時的太陽，在這兒，太陽只能停留兩三個鐘頭，那也是極有趣的生活。</p>
<p>船好容易轉了一個灣四圍還是山，看前面，前面好像沒有出路，看後面，後面似乎也沒有來程：我們從那兒來，我們到那兒去呢？李白說：「黄河之水天上來。」這種情形，長江之水也可以說從山里來，不是水是個流動的東西，那山眞是要將水吞噬掉哩；儘看山有什麽意思呢，我咕嚕着；眞的，那麼死板板的，毫無一點趣味；我懊悔這次不該來了。</p>
<p>「先生：不看山脚，你看山頭呀，山嶺上有趣味的事多着哩！」船伙還是笑迷迷的向我說：於是，他指點我，這是美人峯，這是寡婦崖，我順着他指點的看去，原來山甚也是和女人一樣，她的美是在頭上，而不是在脚下。</p>
<p>在山嶺上，只說她的形態，就有千萬種的變化，有的如熱帶的猛獸，有的如童話中的巨人，有張着臂待人撫抱的美女，有低着頭怨艾的少婦；如筆如刀，像獸像人，山嶺也正如富於變幻的白雲一樣，這個山嶺是不同於那個山嶺的。枯松掛在斷崖削壁的中間，另有她傲然獨存的風格，山烏來往江邊山上，也有她自得的樂趣；野花怒放着，雜樹叢生着，最奇怪的是山上的猴子，聽見輪船的汽笛就將耳朶蒙住，藏在岩縫裏。要是我們乘的小木船，隨你怎樣恐嚇，呼叱，他理也不理的。據船伙說：過去的猴子還要多，現在漸漸地一年少一年了。</p>
<p>「怎麽，那是人在上面嗎？」我忽然看見斷岩削璧的中間有幾個人在蠕動。那是刀鋒一樣的削岩，下面是念湍滾滾的長江，一不小心，跳下來屍身就會沒有的。</p>
<p>「他們在上面割草呀，要活命，那也是沒有法子的，他們都習慣了，脚上穿了釘鞋，跌下來是很少的。」船夫解說着，我想，人眞是一個不幸的生物，為了活命，什麽都是肯冒險的。</p>
<p>當晚，我們宿在南陀，明天，就要過西陵峽最險的新灘了。</p>
<h3>大理石的故鄉</h3>
<p>— 凈夫</p>
<p>嶺南的夏天，故鄉那頂秀雅的祠堂大門，迎着淸快的南風；孩子最愛　　輕靈的雙脚，跨上門邊那兩塊大理石上。磨着細滑凉爽的大理石，像舒服得骨頭都軟綿了呢！這童年時候，便喜歡　着小眼珠子，呌問着大理石是不是從外國來的？說出產在大理，但大理究竟在那兒，就捉摸不到了！</p>
<p>大理，一向是渺渺茫茫的。可是，等到見過了大理，頓像做了一個悠長的美夢那麽迷人的河山呵！</p>
<p>蒼山雪，洱海月，上關花，下關風，妙絕的大理石的故鄉喲！</p>
<p>高聳入雲的蒼山，把大理和外界隔絕了似的。前面臨着洱海，望着洱海的碧波，彷彿自已是臨着天鏡微笑。週遭是幽曠的靑山，生動柔美的綠水，澄淸凈潔的氣色，蒼山和洱海，交抱着，環成像個魚肚兒的大理。</p>
<p>蒼山雪，　給蒼山加了個別名呌銀蒼。大理的天氣並不寒冷，四季都像春天般，但是，蒼山上，却終年積着厚雪，從不嘗有化雲的日子。雪像銀那般白</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>，好個銀山呵！大理的人們，終年處在那氣色澄潔的懷抱裏，白雪銀皎，靑翠欲滴的蒼山麓，碧海如鏡的慧眼前，其曠逸幽秀，堪着這煤烟瀰漫的文明都市，該如何令人追懷不已？</p>
<p>蒼山上，從頭到尾，密密的運接着奇妙壯麗秀雅的十九峯，峯與峯之間，夾着佳勝萬千的十八溪。山勢聳實，岩石險惡，終年不化的厚雪積山，到處溪流瀑布奔縱，從大理外面的蒼山後，沒有方法可以爬登蒼山而越過山頂！從蒼山正面的山頂也不能下蒼山，大理內地打蒼山麓而上，一樣的無路可達山頂。但其中却巧妙的生成了，從蒼山頭到尾，有一條像巨大的馬路似的平頂，直貫通蒼山，使人們不能由上而下；却得從頭到尾的遊玩一番，這比人工更精妙的勝景！</p>
<p>奇妙高險的蒼山中間，籠罩着一帶的白雲，像圍條白玉帶，遠遠望去，是怪美麗的，大理的人們呌做玉帶鎖蒼山。杳杏，飄飄，蒼山下的人們，眞有幾分欲仙之意吧！會願意投下面前那美麗洱海波去，去洗凈滿身的汚塵呢！</p>
<p>海和山緊抱住大理，像無路可通；但恰恰在海和山前後相接之處，有條像妙如曲徑的狹道，可以輕輕的，若飄進夢想中的，谿然開朗的桃源洞般大理的懷抱裏去！</p>
<p>行近大理的旁邊，蒼山在前。正好在入口的上關有九灣橋，出口的下關有黑龍橋；過九灣橋，便有一道山坡斜斜高斜上去，像一架梯兒。人便只可從這兒走進去，登達山坡頂，便幽然閃入大理的口裏去了啦。</p>

<h3>介紹幾個「手頭字」</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>「手頭字」無疑的是比較正楷字簡便得多了。從前，寫到此較重要的文件的時候，總是要一筆一筆的很端正的寫起來，譬如寫到「灑掃」兩個字，就要很複雜的寫成「灑掃」，不可以寫作「洒扫」。那時，我們雖然也知道「灑掃」和「洒扫」是一樣的，但却不敢省事，因為那時的人都說這種簡筆字不是正式的字，是不能登「大雅之堂」的。現在好了，這種「不是正式的字」的手頭字，經過政府及一般文人的提倡，已經引起多人的注意了並且已有三百手頭字已經澆成鉛字，有少數新誌亦已採用了。我覺得這種手頭字的利益很多，第一是節省時間，同時易學易寫，對於推進文化的工作，是有極大的幫助的。我希望各種報紙和書籍都可儘量的採用它。</p>
<p>昨天先生說，各讀者可以把自已所知道的而未經採入那三百字中的手頭字寫出來，在信箱裏發表，以供提倡手頭字的人參考，所以我特把我自已所知道並且是常用的字寫下來，如有錯誤的地方，希望大家指正。專上敬請</p>

<h3>我們所應當知道的茂琳奧莎麗文的生平</h3>
<p>— 宜吉</p>
<p>「泰山情侶」中的那個情侶，茂琳奧莎那文（Maureen　O'Sullivan），她的體格的健美，面容的秀　，以及表演的天眞活潑，早巳使我們牢牢記在心頭了。不久之前，她又在「　怨」中，飾着一個情竇初開的小妹妹，為該片生色不少。「閨怨」的三位主角，瑙瑪希拉，弗德立馬區，和却爾斯賴甫頓，都是好萊塢藝術金牌的得獎者，亦是美國電影藝界的俊俊者，但是茂琳奧莎，　文那種輕鬆自然的表演，却幾乎有靑出於藍之勢。但是我們所知道於她是是什麽這就是記者要吿訴於大家的一些。</p>
<p>我們史應當對於她，及早有些認識的理由，就是　並不想終老於電影界，她的到好萊塢，是一種「票友」性質的，她想嫁人生子，這些或者不久就會成為事實，而使我們不能再在銀幕上看到她的動作。茂琳奧莎麗文從來沒有假乎於新聞宣傳員而博得盛名。她在美國，亦是因為她表演超越，而使觀衆要知道她的一切。我們亦是這樣自動的想要認識她。</p>
<p>茂琳是一家五口的長女。她的父親是英國的一位退伍軍官。她生在愛爾蘭的都白林，所以是愛的　人。到了十一歲的時候，她的父親就將她送到倫敦一個寺院裏去讀書。不到十六歲，她被那學校裏開除了。她被開除的原因是「違背師長，屢戒不悛」。茂琳說：「一個學生得了這樣的頭銜，那裏還有別的學校敢收留我呢」？因此，她就和學校生活脫離了關係。</p>
<p>不久她就到法國凡爾賽去留學，因為那是英國時髦子弟所必須經過的歷程。她在法國不過六個月，就回到愛爾蘭的家中，無憂無慮的玩着，和她同玩的，都是些軍人子弟。她那時對於電影事業，一些沒有夢想到會發生關係的。她或者會嫁了一位靑年軍官就算數的。想不到好萊塢竟伸長了臂膀，把她攫取了去。</p>
<p>那時福期公司的名導演鮑才其，正在愛爾蘭都城攝製約翰麥考密的Song　of　My　Heart。在一天的晚上，這一般攝影隊的人，偶然涉足於一家舞餐的塲所。在幾百個男男女女，歡欣快樂之中，鮑才其忽然看見了茂琳，而非常的注意她。他寫了一張字條，吩咐侍者去遞給她，請求和她談話。茂琳聽說這位美國名導說要和她談話，她一時心動，竟頜首表示許可。鮑才其於是就跑了過去，吿訴她他正在尋覓一位女主角，而她正是他所尋求的人。</p>
<p>茂琳知道她的家庭一定要反對她的拍影戲的。因此，她亦不吿訴家中，而天天跑到鮑才其工作的地方看他們拍戲。她接連着了四天。到了第四天的臨了，飽才其叫了她去，將她化妝了，敎了她幾句對白，就將她推到開木拉前面，開始試演起來。茂琳簡直感得莫名其妙，但是她是天才的演員，試騐的結果却妙到出人意料之外。第二天，鮑才其就跑到她的家裏，和她的父母談判。結果，她的母親答應了陪伴她的女兒，到好萊塢去走一趟。這就是茂琳奧莎麗文到好萊塢的起頭，那是她紙有十八歲。</p>
<p>茂琳到了好萊塢一切定局之後，她的母親就很滿意的回家了。因為福斯公司並沒有重用她，所以她拍了幾張平席的片子之後，就被米高梅羅致了去。她除了在「泰山情侶」開始為人們所認識並且在「閨怨」一舉成名之外，還要在却爾斯迭更司的名著「塊肉餘生述」裏，充任大衛的夫人都拉。但是她雖享受明星的地位，她對於電影事業或好萊塢，却很平淡觀之。她始終維持了她那票友及非職業的態度。</p>
<p>「表演」？她說：「我並不感到特別的興趣。我是天性散慢，不喜歡這種繁重的工作的。我的成名，完全是碰運氣。我並沒有電影的志願，亦沒有什麼野心。我說這種話，並不是我不知感激，但是我總覺得委居於家中的人，要比較的快活自在些。祇有二件事，逼迫着我向前進的：一個是要積聚金錢，使我將來能經濟獨立；一個是虛榮心，使我要成就些事業在我已經到了好萊塢三四年之後」。“</p>
<p>不差的，茂琳並沒有什麼錢，並為她乎頭太散漫的原故，但是她將來一定可以如願以償的。至於她的成就，也巳經斐然可觀了。她現在還不過芳齡二十二歲也。</p>
<h3>評「美人心」</h3>
<p>— 華倫</p>
<p>——新光映——</p>
<p>原名上曾標着白山黑水的「美人心」，在這年頭映出了，相當地敎我們溫習了白山黑水間的一頁漫畫。這漫畫雖是被某種風塵的壓力弄得像一面蒙着沙灰潰汚的鏡子，可是由這鏡面仍舊是多少反映也了某些認賊作父者的面貌，以及為生存而掙扎着的大羣人們的姿態的。因此，一美人心」在主題抓取的本意上，總該獲得較高之計價的。</p>
<p>遺憾的是由於作者對他自己所捉住的偉大題材之認識與表現態度上欠嚴肅，隨着减低了它所應有的成就。自然，我們在目前一些反映現實之作品的遭遇艱難上，並不一定不同意作者用些似金鷄納霜外面糖皮那樣的東西，比如「美人心」的披着戀愛羅曼司的外衣，但糖皮過厚的金鷄納霜，會變成甜的糖果的，正如「美人心」的由於羅曼司這外衣披得過厚，有給人正面地把牠當英雄落難，小姐搭救，後花團定情，這些老套來欣賞，而忽視了反面的一此，也使作者遭受到意外的損失失所謂適得其反的效果。這原因是表現的技術問題，更是對這一　　的認識與處理的態度問題。由於表現技術方面的欠缺，把李鐸這人寫得沒有個性，成爲神化的人物。這兄素如的私心愛他，與她父親的同情他，都沒有適當的理由與佈置。至如農民夫妻倆的一聽到他是「逃犯」僅僅只說是一個「逃犯」，而就心悅誠服的當他為民族英雄看待，眞是太草率從事了。由於對這民族拒敵戰道一艱難因苦的民族悲壯劇認識的不夠，於是處理的態度上就不免失其嚴肅。又如素如把李鋒的照片帶在婢女身上，一下子搬到她家中住着，在這個有認賊作父者流的漢奸叔姪常來的家庭中，居然公開地騎馬出進，並且能够在後花園講情話等。這兒忽視了偵騎四佈，探訪嚴密的滅人國者的嚴重壓迫，因此也就减弱了戲劇感人的效果。至於身為某國顧問者，這都是何等精細的人，而會在不相干的老頭子面前對些軍官韓堅說機密，同樣如司令官的辦公室與接待室會合在一處而讓素如看見他蓋重要的公文圖章等，都是太做戲了！此外，如韓氏叔姪同時送禮給素如的那一段，在劇情上也是和韓堅這司令官與素如這大家　秀的身份不調和的自然，這些還都是小地方，我們再舉一點來看，在李鋒他們為民衆謀福利的軍隊打來時，作者呌莫之這人來命令兵士們反正。在畫面上固然成功了反正這回了，可是事實上道類投機的人事，在生與死的角逐中是决不會有的吧？</p>
<p>從整個演出上來看，「美人心」是有着平平的成績的。但導演在織接上遇着兩方面的描寫時不免有顧此失彼之憾，往往這邊一長段，那邊就另一起落，不能相乘地交織着，而使書面更活潑一些。光綫上　澀的地方多於明快之處</p>
<p>演技以徐莘園，胡蝶爲校佳。</p>
<h3>評「一代英雄」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>Jew　Suss——國泰</p>
<p>首先我得聲明，關於「Jew　Sues」小說原著，自已沒有讀過，所以現在祗能就銀幕上所表現的，作為批評的根據。和喬其亞立斯主演的「大富之家」，和康勒維德主演的「萍飄絮泊」（The　Wandering　Jew）一樣，道裏以沒有國家的猶太民族，痛苦與悲壯的遭遇作為影片的題材。這正因為猶太人沒有了國家，正因為他們受盡了亡國的痛苦，於是正義感的電影們，在電影上反應他們的生活和猶太民族共同的憤恨，這不僅有着偉大的藝術價値，更主要的是在發揚被壓迫的民族反抗精神上，更有其偉大的意義。</p>
<p>在這裏出現的約瑟夫蘇斯，也許人們會以為他是傻子吧，那樣的個人英雄主義的反抗行為，對照着現階段弱小民族革命運動的觀點上，不能不是行動的錯誤。然而在他身上，作者所寄托的對於亡國的憤恨，以及他們所受到日爾曼民族之歧視與殘酷的虐待，無論如何是引起了觀衆們熱烈之同情的，何况這一英雄是為民族而勇敢犧牲了的。僅以這一點來說，對照着目前中國民族所遭受到帝國主義之壓迫，以及我們在帝國主義鐵蹄蹂躪之下的慘痛，不消說是給與我們很大的刺戟的了。所以這一影片在中國開映，乃是很有意義的了。</p>
<p>「一代英雄是一部成功的藝術作品。由於內容的嚴肅，導演Lotlar　Mendes便以極沉重的調子表現着。劇作者對於劇的把握，極為成功；這裏看不到無味的過塲戲，所有的全是Dramatic的發揮，而導演沉重的氛圍氣的成功，使每一個觀衆感受着「一種沉重的呼吸的壓迫，更是人們所不敢忽視的了。</p>
<p>自然，這一影片假使沒有康勒維德的神奇的表演，也不會達到如此成功的地步。由於導演非常技術的處理，有幾塲戲眞是驚人的成功。譬如蘇斯榮婦故里的時候，室外有着沸騰的歡呼聲，他抱着母親熱烈的純愛。他在窗口對同胞演說，母與子之間給民族的光榮所陶醉。一直到他看到了母親的情書，知道自己是德人的血族，這使他對着崇高的叔父表現着民族觀念的動搖，其內心痛苦與矛盾，達到了最高的成功。又如當他知道了女兒的慘死之後，他揭開了尸身上的白布，他沉重的倒在尸身旁邊，那無言的悲痛，一直到他在門前大呼猶太萬歲的時候為止，由悲痛到狂熱的過程，給與了人們極大的感動。</p>
<p>此外如他使卡爾活活的氣死的時候，他在卡爾耳邊咬牙切齒的咒駡，以及在最後臨刑的時候，都是他演技的最高表現。至於飾卡爾的佛蘭克沃斯勃（Frank　Vospar），雖然也很有成績，却嫌過火一些，其他諸人都很盡職。</p>
<p>總之，這是一部成功的作品。</p>

<h3>印度亡國恨（Cive　Of　India）（七）</h3>
<p>— 懋德</p>
<p>不一回兒那人己經站在她的面前。他一聲不響，　然不動地看了她半天，然後走上了一步，聲音很急促的喊道：「你是瑪格勤蒂……是的……；你就是瑪格勒蒂。」這時，他覺得她就是他夢寐之中，所縈思的人。但是却比他夢中所想的，還要美麗些。瑪格勒蒂囁嚅着道：「那個歡迎會……總督……」她想竭力維持她的安閑狀態。克萊夫却又問道：「讓他們等一回。你光告訴我……你是到這裏來和我結婚的，是不是？請你告訴我。當然是的，是不是？」他很確定的，除了是之外，沒有其他的答復的。</p>
<p>瑪格勒蒂儘力想說「不是」，好維持她搖搖欲倒的少女的尊嚴，但是她一開口，却祗說出了一個「是」字，並且澴齒牙相擊着，加上了一句「不差的」。過了一回，她忽然又掉過頭來，喊着：「哦，不得了了！」克萊夫不覺狂呼道：「哦，再好沒有了！」她是他心目中惟一的好女子！瑪格勒蒂還說道：「但是！你不知道，現在己經不比從前了。」克萊夫想了一想道：「你說的是我嗎？我眞不應該這副神氣跑進來見你：我一身的灰沙汚穢……」瑪格勒蒂又走近了一步道：「不是的，不是的。我說……你現在是一個大人物了——你已經征服了全印度。」克萊夫笑道：「這才剛剛起頭！將來你還要在白克萊廣塲蓋起大住宅……還有高車大馬……還有一天要做動爵夫人哩！」</p>
<p>瑪格勒蒂微笑着道：「除此之外，就沒有別的了嗎？」克萊夫忽然足恭着說道：「還有我的人，如果値得讓你要的話。」瑪格勒蒂道：「祇要你的人就够了。」他抓起了她的手。忽然想起了他身上的骯髒，又急忙吿罪道：「對不起，我的手，我的衣服，都不配碰你。」瑪格勒蒂看了他一回，覺得那是一位心口如一的男兒，她的一顆心就默默許可了。她走上一步，在他的唇上吻了一下。</p>
<p>克萊夫被她一吻，不覺喊道：「噫，眞是一位勇敢的女子。好，我們去吧。我們一同到歡迎會去。這不是一個很好的頭嗎？」瑪格勒蒂道：「起頭？」克萊夫道：「不差的，我們共同生活的起頭。」瑪格勒蒂道：「但願將來的結局，當它來到的時候，亦像這像這樣就好了。」</p>
<p>他們到了會塲，在大衆歡呼之中，向總督坐的台前走着。克萊夫所最高與的是人，瑪格勒蒂的態度十分安閑，雖然她搭在他臂膊上的　手，微微有些震動。總督看見他們走近了，很藹然地站了起來歡迎他們。克萊夫於是就引見了瑪格勒蒂。他說她是他未來的夫人。瑪　勒蒂連忙向着總督所腰為禮，並且向大衆亦一一答謝了他們的敬禮。</p>
<p>最後，他們夫婦回到了故鄕英格蘭。他們住在皇后廣塲的華美住宅裏。他們已經富而且貴了。</p>
<p>但是克萊夫却又想到更偉大光榮的前途。雖然照着瑪格勒蒂原有的意思，但得她和她的丈夫同住在一所小村舍之中永遠厮守着，於願可云已足，但是克萊夫覺得兒女雖是情長，英雄却並不氣短。他一心想為了美人，要將世界征服了，放在她的足下，好更博得她的崇敬歡和心。（未完）</p>

<h3>Issuance of Financial Public Bonds to be Submitted to the Legislative Yuan for Discussion; Guaranteed by Customs Revenue for Repayment in Ten Years; Annual Interest Rate of Six Percent; Denominations Include Ten Yuan, One Hundred Yuan, etc.; Statements by Wang Jingwei and Kong Xiangxi</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The case of the 100 million yuan financial public bonds approved by the Central Political Council has reportedly been sent to the Legislative Yuan with all relevant documents. It will be discussed at the Legislative Yuan's general meeting next Wednesday. It is reported that the bonds are guaranteed by customs revenue and will be repaid in ten years, with an annual interest rate of six percent. The denominations include ten yuan, one hundred yuan, one thousand yuan, ten thousand yuan, and so on. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi is paying close attention to the stamp tax revenue situation in various provinces. Currently, the postal bureaus in Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Henan, and Hubei provinces have poor sales records. Therefore, Wang Wenwei and Shi Chunlin have been specially dispatched to Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and other provinces for strict inspection. Both officials are scheduled to depart next week. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Li Yuan, the chief secretary of the Ministry of Finance, stated that the financial public bonds being requested for issuance by the ministry are solely for regulating the market and rescuing finance. Specifically, 65 million yuan will be used to increase the capital of the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications. The remaining funds will be allocated to the Central Bank as working capital for circulation. It is planned to issue the bonds next month, and they will not circulate in the market but will only be taken up by the banks themselves. The Ministry of Finance has designated customs revenue as collateral and will allocate funds from the customs revenue each month to a principal and interest fund, which will be managed by the National Debt Fund Management Committee. The loan methods are still being discussed by all parties to allow industries and businesses to borrow from the aforementioned banks within a possible scope. Li continued, the Ministry believes that in addition to issuing public bonds as a temporary measure to rescue industry and commerce, the fundamental solution lies in encouraging exports to reduce trade deficits. Therefore, it has proposed to the Central Government to reduce or exempt export taxes and abolish transit taxes. The Central Political Council has approved the principle. The reduction and exemption of export taxes still require careful review to determine which should be reduced and which should be exempted. It can only be implemented after all procedures have been completed. The abolition of transit taxes has been under discussion for the past few years, but it has not been implemented due to concerns about national treasury revenue. This time, Kong decisively abolished the tax to rescue the declining industry and commerce. The annual revenue from this tax is approximately 15 million yuan. Once abolished, the national treasury must find alternative ways to compensate. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) This reporter visited Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi on the 20th and inquired about measures to rescue industry and commerce. He replied as follows: There are many reasons why China's industry and commerce have declined to today's critical state. The most important are the trade deficit and the impact of the United States' silver policy, which has led to a massive outflow of silver reserves, financial exhaustion, and difficult market turnover. In addition to taking measures to prevent the massive outflow of silver, the current focus should be on rescuing industry and commerce. On one hand, we should encourage exports to reduce the trade deficit. On the other hand, we should increase the financial strength of banks to facilitate capital and stabilize the market. The Ministry is now proposing two plans. One is to issue 100 million yuan of financial public bonds in the 24th year of the Republic, with 30 million yuan allocated to supplement the capital of the Central Bank, 25 million yuan allocated to supplement the capital of the Bank of China, and 10 million yuan allocated to supplement the capital of the Bank of Communications. The three banks will jointly formulate loan methods to rescue the market. Since the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications have always been the center of providing financial assistance to industry and commerce, the three banks will inevitably be unable to cope. Therefore, the government is still issuing public bonds at this time of extreme financial difficulty to replenish the capital of the three banks, and the intention is in this regard. The other is to reduce or exempt export taxes and abolish transit taxes, with the intention of encouraging exports, reducing the trade deficit, reducing the burden on the people, and facilitating the flow of goods. The two cases have been approved by today's Central Political Council and will be implemented on a scheduled basis after the various procedures have been completed. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Political Council passed the principle of issuing 100 million yuan of financial public bonds on the 20th. The significance and purpose of issuing these public bonds were discussed by Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi yesterday. Because this matter has a significant impact on finance and outside parties have doubts, this reporter paid another visit to Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei. He granted an audience and solemnly told the reporter that the purpose of issuing financial public bonds is to increase the capital of the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, so as to revitalize finance and provide support for industry and commerce. There is absolutely no intention of manipulating the market. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Discusses the Budget for the 24th Year of the Republic</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan held a meeting at 2 PM on the 20th to discuss the budget proposals for the Executive Yuan and its affiliated ministries and agencies for the 24th year of the Republic. Those present included Kong Xiangxi, Wang Shijie, Chen Gongbo, Chen Shaokuan, Chen Shuren, Liu Ruiheng, and various vice ministers. The meeting was chaired by Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei and adjourned at 5 PM. It is reported that the heads of various ministries and agencies presented their opinions on the increase or decrease of the budget, and no final decision has been made. Another meeting will be held to discuss the matter further, and the results will be sent to the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics to compile the national general budget for the 24th year of the Republic.

<p>(Nanjing) The Financial and Commercial Committees of the Legislative Yuan are scheduled to jointly review the amendment to the Exchange Law on the morning of the 22nd. It is reported that the preliminary review opinions on the original amendment have been slightly supplemented. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<h3>Japan Prevents Chinese Laborers from Leaving the Customs; Central Government to Negotiate Based on Reason; Some of the Blocked Travelers Leave the Customs</h3>
<p>The Puppet Organization Promulgates Measures Prohibiting Laborers of All Countries from Entering the Customs</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the Japanese side's prevention of Chinese laborers from leaving the Customs, the underlying reason is the overall plan to develop the Yamato nation. Therefore, this issue is quite serious. Our side has met with the Japanese side several times, intending to ask the Japanese side to postpone it for one year, and then seek a proper solution next year, but there has been no result so far. Now our side has reported the situation to the Central Government, and it is reported that the Central Government will negotiate with the Japanese side based on reason. In recent years, the total number of immigrants from Shandong, Hebei, Henan, and Chahar to the Northeast averages more than three million each year. The farmers and workers who move outside the Customs are able to endure hardship and their living standards are extremely low. Therefore, the amount remitted from outside the Customs to inside the Customs each year is about 30 million yuan. Before the September 18th Incident, only about 200,000 Japanese and Koreans moved to the Eastern Provinces, and their living standards were extremely high, so they could not compete with the Chinese. In view of this, the Japanese side has recently decided to limit Chinese laborers from leaving the Customs, intending to transplant Japanese and Koreans to the Northeast as much as possible to develop their national strength. Therefore, this issue is even more important than political issues. Currently, various embassies are paying close attention to this. After Japan refused to allow Chinese laborers to leave the Customs, the properties of the original immigrants outside the Customs are not allowed to be remitted back inside the Customs. It is estimated that at least two to three million people will suffer losses. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) For days, travelers have been blocked at Yuguan. Most have returned to Pingjin, while a small number have had Japanese and Korean rogues buy puppet state entry permits on their behalf and protect them as they board trains to leave the Customs. Each permit costs between four or five yuan to seven or eight yuan. Japanese and Korean rogues are relying on this to speculate and make money. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tonight, only about 20 tickets for the section of the Ping-Shen train outside the Customs were sold, all of which were third-class tickets. According to those who came to Beiping from Yuguan today, the Dadong Company established by the Japanese in Yuguan, in addition to conducting strict inspections and registrations for travelers allowed to leave the Customs and issuing entry permits, has added photography to the process since the 20th and now requires photographs to be taken and kept on file. There are still three or four hundred poor farmers stranded in Yuguan, wandering the streets all day long without a place to turn. The situation is extremely pitiful. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The entry permits sold by the puppet Dadong Company used to cost one yuan in national currency, worth eight jiao in Tianjin-Shanghai banknotes. Now the price is one yuan in silver dollars, an increase of two jiao in disguise. When allowing travelers to leave the Customs to purchase the permits, they also make things difficult. It is widely rumored in Shanhaiguan that the puppet state will ease the restrictions on Chinese people leaving the Customs on April 1st or come up with other more lenient measures. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Su Yuqi, the director of the Shanhaiguan Public Security Bureau, and Yuan Tai, the county magistrate of Linyu County, telegraphed the Hebei Provincial Government successively, reporting on the puppet state's process of restricting Chinese people from entering the Customs.

<h3>The Asahi Newspaper's Visiting Aircraft; Both Pilots Visited the Mausoleum Yesterday; The Capital's Press Circle Gave a Welcome Banquet</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Asahi Newspaper's visiting aircraft from Japan arrived in Nanjing, Shigeru Kamio, the director of the Eastern Department of the company, also arrived here from Shanghai at 7:30 PM on the 20th. At around 8 AM on the 21st, Kamio, accompanied by the two pilots, Hyosaburo Niino and Kenji Tsukagoshi, and Kinoshita, the director of the Shanghai branch of the company, and Miyazaki, the reporter stationed in Beijing, paid their respects at the Mausoleum of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, presented wreaths, and admired the architecture of the mausoleum and toured the scenery. They then entered the city and went to the official residence of the Ministry of Railways at 10:00 AM to pay their respects to Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei, expressing their respect and leaving after a brief conversation.

Suma, the Consul-General of Japan, Tanaka Asami, the vice-consul, Motomoto, and the naval attache Kitamura, the army attache Seki, and our Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs Gao Zongwu and Section Chief Huang Chaoqin were also invited to accompany them. During the seating, Shi Xinjia, the president of the Xinjing Daily, delivered a welcome speech, roughly saying that today the Nanjing press colleagues welcome the visiting aircraft colleagues of the Asahi Newspaper of Japan, and it is a great pleasure to have friends such as Suma and the Consul-General and attache participate. The Asahi visiting aircraft arrived in Nanjing, the capital of China, in a few hours of flight, and we can see the progress of modern science and civilization. The visit between the two countries' industries makes it possible for colleagues from both countries to meet and talk here, which is particularly gratifying. The Chinese people have always loved peace, as seen by the world. The responsibility of the newspaper is to report true news faithfully and without arrogance. In the past, the Asahi Newspaper in Japanese newspapers could see this. I hope that colleagues in your country will take a step further in the future, and all will be able to work equally hard to enable people of both countries to recognize and understand each other through the introduction of newspapers, so that East Asian peace and world happiness are based on this. Colleagues from our country are also willing to work together on the above points. After the speech, Kamio answered, translated by Vice-Consul Motomoto. The general meaning is that the purpose of this visit to your country's capital is to realize the test flight of the China-Japan air route, so that aviation in China-Japan traffic can be realized in the future, and people of both countries will inevitably be more convenient to travel to each other. The purpose of our visit is to use this scientifically advanced means of transportation to give the people of both countries more opportunities to come into contact with and recognize each other, so that emotions can be increased and friendship can be promoted. After Kamio gave his reply, Niino, the pilot, reported on the flight experience, hoping that in the near future, your country will also send aircraft to visit our country and receive the enthusiastic welcome of our people.

When the chief and deputy commanders returned power to the local governments, they were commended by Your Excellency in a telegram. However, at this time of new endeavors and handover, personnel in various counties and bureaus, clinging to old habits, have not been able to strictly comply with the new orders.

Upon receiving Your Excellency's order, I have telegraphed to the heads of all counties and bureaus, urging them to follow the virtuous decree and not to overstep it in the slightest, so as to fulfill Your Excellency's utmost intention to save the people from fire and water.

<h3>A Further Experiment in Mass Education</h3>
<p>— Like</p>
<p>Adult education began with the arrival of this century. It initially did not have a definite position in the educational systems of various countries. However, with the government's close attention, it has gradually become an important part of national education. For example, Italy unified public and private mass schools under the so-called "Committee Against Illiteracy" (Comitato Contro Analfabet＇smo) and unified social education programs under the "National After-Work Activities Headquarters" (Opera Nazionale Ddopolavoro). This firmly demonstrates the government's determination and courage in vigorously implementing mass education. Furthermore, the governments of various German states subsidize "People's High Schools" (Volksbochschule) as stipulated in the federal constitution. The "University Tutorial Classes," initially organized by the Labor Education Association in England, are also subject to regulations formulated by the Ministry of Education and receive subsidies from the central and local governments according to law. These are all the most notable proofs. Whether it is in the competition of national intelligence or in the support of democratic forces, mass education has an urgent need.</p>
<p>China's mass education movement began with the establishment of the Chinese National Association of the Mass Education Movement in the twelfth year of the Republic. It saw a tremendous advance with the success of the National Revolution in the sixteenth year of the Republic. In recent years, various local mass education, rural construction, and rural service experimental institutions have gradually attracted the attention of the general public. Recently, the Jiangsu Provincial Education College held its seventh anniversary celebration and exhibition of achievements. The Minister of Education and the director of the relevant department personally came to inspect. Minister Wang said in his speech at the college, "I hope that all teachers and students will, with a full spirit of service, strive to establish the academic field of mass education, making mass education scientific rather than just common sense." This also demonstrates the government's attention to mass education. Originally, all academic fields originate from real-life activities. Starting from practical activities, exploring their principles, and standardizing their methods, they become academic fields. And academic fields, in turn, guide practical activities. There is no need to waste words or research on why mass education must be promoted. Only how to promote it effectively is what needs to be explored by various local experimental and research institutions in their actual activities to find the correct principles and methods. If with certain funds and talents, certain undertakings are operated, and the result is only equal to undertakings that anyone can hold with this funding and talents, then why should these experimental and research institutions be established? Therefore, whether this type of institution can fulfill its mission depends on whether it can provide correct and effective principles and methods in education. The rationale is clear. Therefore, I feel that Minister Wang's saying "making mass education scientific rather than just common sense" contains a great truth and has much in common.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since the Ministry of Education's first Mass Education Committee meeting in the twenty-third year of the Republic resolved on "the implementation pathways of mass education" and instructed that "various mass education institutions should provide practical life organizations, tools, and technologies, and do their best to organize experimental zones and other experimental undertakings," the scope of so-called mass education has expanded and is no longer limited to literacy education. Currently, larger mass education experimental zones mostly include agricultural experiments and promotions, agricultural warehouses, various cooperative organizations, civic training, hygiene facilities, and even rural self-defense undertakings. For example, Zouping and Dingxian even use the entire county administration as an experiment in mass education. In terms of undertakings, it already includes countless sciences and is not limited to education. However, in terms of academics, any research must prioritize division of labor and specialized study. Even taking agriculture as an example, those conducting research include the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute and the agricultural colleges of universities. Based on the equipment and talents of mass education institutions, it is feared that they only have the strength to conduct small-scale regional experiments and promotions. The same is true for finance, cooperation, autonomy, and self-defense. The improvement of an entire area requires the entire political and economic structure, which cannot ultimately be solely undertaken by an educational institution. In terms of mass education institutions, how to base their own academic fields, concentrate all their energies and financial resources, and engage in further, narrower, and more controlled experiments; on the one hand, to obtain contact with other institutions and avoid duplication; on the other hand, to gradually standardize effective methods for education and provide them for promotion in various places; to make industries refined through division and efforts substantial through focus is indeed a problem that urgently needs careful consideration. This is especially what I would like to discuss with those responsible for mass education experiments.</p>
<h3>Zhu Mao Again Fled to the Border of Sichuan and Yunnan; Bandits Have Fled to Various Roads of the Chishui River and are Being Pursued; Xiao He Suffered Thousands of Casualties, Yongshun Can be Recovered Soon</h3>
<p>(Changsha) The chairman of Guizhou, Wang Jialie, telegraphed that Zhu Mao's bandit troops have suffered heavy losses and been severely damaged due to the pursuit by our large army along multiple routes.

(2) Since Article 4 of the Implementation Rules of the Accountant's Law clearly stipulates that the government agency in Article 3 of the Accountant's Law is limited to government agencies, provincial and municipal party departments and private schools cannot be compared and handled.

<h3>Flandin and Simon Express Views Openly; France and Italy Protest German Refusal; The Three-Country Conference is the Most Important in Fifty Years; The League of Nations Administrative Council Sets a Meeting for Early Next Month</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The French Ambassador to Germany, Poncet, submitted a note protesting Germany's violation of the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles to the German Foreign Minister Neurath at 11:00 this morning. The note was two pages long and worded strongly, recognizing Hitler's abandonment of the treaty as illegal. Shortly after, the Italian Ambassador Saluti also submitted a note from the Italian government to Foreign Minister Neuart at 1:00 PM. Although its contents have not yet been disclosed, informed sources in diplomatic circles say that the Italian note is generally the same as the French note, but its wording is more moderate. It is also reported that the German Foreign Minister replied at the time that since other countries do not implement disarmament, the military clauses of the treaty have long been abolished, and Germany cannot accept the protest. Berlin opinion now believes that France will use the three-country conference of England, Italy, and France to be convened in Paris on Saturday to form a line to surround Germany. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(Rome) It was learned from reliable sources today that Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Minister Simon will represent the United Kingdom, and Prime Minister Flandin and Foreign Minister Laval will represent France to participate in the second Three-Power Conference. The conference will be held in Rome after Foreign Minister Simon and Seal Keeper Eden visit Berlin, Warsaw, and Moscow. It is also known that the conference is a supplement to the preparatory meeting in Paris on Saturday and is the most important conference in Europe in the past fifty years. Its impact on world peace is by no means small. Observers said that the British and French authorities and Mussolini will understand the attitudes of Soviet Russia and Poland towards maintaining the Treaty of Versailles at the Rome Conference. As for Germany's true intentions, Simon's meeting with Hitler will also be able to learn its general outline. (National Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) It was learned today that the League of Nations Administrative Council will convene a special meeting in early April at the request of France to discuss Germany's violation of the Treaty of Versailles and the establishment of an army of 500,000 people. Informed sources believe that France's decision to apply to the League of Nations Administrative Council to convene a meeting is intended to curb Germany's further violation of the Treaty of Versailles and demand the abolition of demilitarized zones and the redrawing of borders. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(Paris) Prime Minister Flandin warned Germany in a speech in the House of Representatives today, saying that the Allied countries won the last war, "and can still win now." After Germany implements conscription, it will have a standing army of 500,000 people, which will be the largest army in Europe except for Russia. However, German officials said that the French army has long exceeded 500,000, and there are plans to extend military service to two years, which will double the number. The House of Representatives has voted three times to trust the government on France's plan to extend military service, and the Senate also passed it yesterday, so the Prime Minister can actually freely dispose of Germany. The French government has stated that it does not fully agree with the British Foreign Minister Simon and Seal Keeper Eden's visit to Germany. Originally, France very much wanted Germany to participate in the British-French Air Force Agreement and allow Germany to restore its military strength after returning to the League of Nations. However, Hitler decided to abandon the treaty without waiting for British diplomats to go to Germany, and France's feelings have changed because of this. Therefore, the notes sent to Germany and the League of Nations today are contrary to British advice. France believes that the diplomatic period is over. The Prime Minister also said in a speech in the Senate that the French army must increase its strength, and France cannot accept Germany's unilateral abandonment of the treaty without consulting with the relevant countries. The Senate has approved the Foreign Minister to go to Moscow to discuss the situation with Soviet Russia. According to unofficial news, Mussolini believes that the Allied countries during the European War should still have a common front for this crisis. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Minister Simon declared to the House of Commons today that Britain will never allow changes to the Treaty of Versailles without the approval of Parliament, and said that the trip to Berlin and Moscow will be purely explanatory. It was also announced by the government that Britain has accepted Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's invitation to discuss the issue of German rearmament at the British-French-Italian conference. The first meeting will be held in Paris on Saturday and will be represented by Seal Keeper Eden. After the meeting, Eden will immediately meet with the Foreign Minister in Berlin, and then discuss with the German authorities the matter of participating in the British-French Air Force Agreement. It is now known that after the first meeting in Paris, the second meeting will be held in Rome in the future. Russia and the Little Entente may also be invited to participate, which will be after Eden returns from Berlin, Warsaw, and Moscow. The Rome meeting will be attended by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, British Prime Minister MacDonald, Foreign Minister Simon, and French Prime Minister Flandin and Foreign Minister Laval. According to rumors from official sources, the German disarmament representative Ribbentrop has secretly come to England, but this statement has not been confirmed. Diplomatic circles learned from reliable sources that Li did leave Germany for England on Monday, but he was recalled by Hitler en route. Hitler was concerned that France was dissatisfied with direct British-German negotiations and feared that Li's trip would cause a bad impression. The United States today formally expressed its interest in the European situation for the first time. American Embassy Counselor Anderson met with the Foreign Minister for more than an hour, but it was subsequently announced that Anderson did not mention the official opinions of the American government.

<h3>French Telegram to Geneva: Requesting a Special Meeting of the League of Nations, Germans Believe it Will Only Increase Disputes</h3>
<p>(Paris) France's communication to the League of Nations has been sent today. It is said that this communication does not request an immediate meeting of the Administrative Council, as France believes there is no immediate danger. However, it asks the League of Nations to pay attention to Germany's arbitrary behavior and the damage that Germany's actions will cause to mutual national trust and world peace. League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol will forward the French communication to the President and other council members to decide when to hold a meeting. A meeting can only be convened after a unanimous decision of the Administrative Council. The French press welcomes the resolution of the three countries, England, France, and Italy, to meet in Paris before British Foreign Secretary Simon visits Germany, saying that the cooperation of the three countries is now strong and effective. Berlin has criticized France's appeal to the League of Nations, with much sarcasm. The Deutsche Tageszeitung stated in today's editorial that France's resumption of its alliance policy has long denied the purpose of the League of Nations, and that no matter what action Geneva takes, the progress of this matter will not be affected in the slightest. According to a Reuters dispatch from London, Simon will reportedly propose naval issues during his visit to Berlin. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French government has recently sent a document to League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, requesting the convening of the Administrative Council to deal with the problem of Germany's violation of the Treaty of Versailles. The French government's document is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"On March 16, the German government notified the diplomatic representatives of France, England, Italy, and Poland stationed in Germany, and on the same day promulgated a law stating that the German government has decided to restore compulsory conscription and reorganize the German army into twelve corps, namely thirty-six divisions. Several days before this event, the German authorities openly announced the establishment of an air force. Article 11, paragraph 2 of the Covenant of the League of Nations states that any member of the League of Nations has the right to bring to the attention of the Administrative Council any situation that arises that is likely to affect international relations, thereby disturbing peace or endangering the good understanding on which international peace depends. The situation created by the aforementioned decision of the German government is the same as that stipulated in paragraph 2 of Article 2 of the Covenant. Therefore, the French government specifically brings this attitude of the German government to the attention of the Administrative Council. It would be a great honor, and the problems caused by the aforementioned decision of the German government are extremely important, so I specifically request that an extraordinary meeting of the Administrative Council be convened to review the French government's request. Signed, Laval." (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) The British political circles regard France's resolution to appeal to the League of Nations as a kind of psychological consolation. However, London is gradually feeling that recent events are very serious and will sooner or later have to be mentioned in Geneva. If an appeal is made to the League of Nations in the future, it does not seem likely that the military provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, which Germany is currently violating, will be cited, nor will Article 16 of the Covenant of the League of Nations on the implementation of economic sanctions be invoked. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) People in Berlin did not express any surprise upon hearing the news that France had decided to appeal to the League of Nations regarding Germany's implementation of compulsory military service. A government spokesman claimed today that France's move would only increase the disputes in the current situation. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<h3>French and Italian Representations to Germany: Differing Content, Not Recognizing Unilateral Treaty Abrogation, German Foreign Minister Rejects</h3>
<p>(Berlin) French Ambassador to Germany, Poncet, recently presented a note from the French government to German Foreign Minister Neurath. The note stated: "The French Ambassador to Germany received a notification from the German Foreign Ministry on March 16, stating that the German government promulgated a law on Saturday, deciding to restore compulsory conscription and increase the army's troop strength to thirty-six divisions. A week before this, the German authorities had formally announced the establishment of the German Air Force. The above resolutions are in absolute violation of Germany's treaty obligations and are contrary to the declaration participated in by the German government on December 11, 1932. In that declaration, the German government had promised that the general armament system, which allows Germany and other countries to enjoy equal rights, could not be implemented until a security system was established in various countries. Therefore, the French government is justified in lodging a formal protest against this measure by Germany and, from now on, making various reservations. The French government has always adopted a cooperative attitude and made unremitting efforts to enable Germany to fully participate in the European security organization with great sincerity and consideration for German dignity. Now that Germany has taken this action to violate the treaty, causing anxiety throughout the world, the obligations borne by the countries concerned have been increased, and the German government must bear the responsibility for all the consequences. The French government has decided to seek all means to promote international cooperation in order to eliminate this anxiety and to safeguard European peace. It is hereby reiterated that France has always respected and believed in treaties. Unilateral decisions that undermine international constraints should be rejected from consideration in any negotiations," etc. According to Havas, Foreign Minister Neurath said when receiving the French Ambassador that he had received this protest. In addition, he said that Germany's position was very different from this. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Italian government sent a protest note to the Italian Ambassador to Germany, Cerruti, for delivery to the German government. The note began by stating, "The Franco-Italian Rome Agreement of January 7 and the Anglo-French London Agreement of February 3 both stated that the main principles of Part V of the Treaty of Versailles concerning the military system cannot be unilaterally changed. Italy maintains that the German armament issue should be discussed in the general negotiations on the issue. This is the same as the Geneva Declaration in which Germany participated on December 11, 1932. The German government also accepted this approach in its notes to England and France on February 14, 1935. Therefore, the Italian government believes that it is justified in making special reservations regarding this decision by Germany and its possible developments." The conclusion stated, "The Italian government believes that the fait accompli created by unilaterally deciding to cancel international constraints cannot be accepted in future talks," etc. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) A semi-official German news agency recently released a message stating that after Foreign Minister Neurath received the protest note from the Italian government, he told Italian Ambassador to Germany Cerruti that the reasons on which Italy's communication was based should be rejected, because the other signatories of the Treaty of Versailles had not fulfilled their promises regarding the clauses on disarmament, and they had not adhered to the Treaty of Versailles. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<h3>French Premier's Declaration on Germany in the Senate: No Anxiety in Germany Upon Hearing It</h3>
<p>(Paris) Today, the Senate convened to discuss the question raised by Senator Le Merit, asking the government by what means it would make up for the shortage of new recruits caused by the decline in population births during the war. Premier Flandin delivered a lengthy speech in response. Finally, the Senate passed a vote of confidence in the government with 263 votes to 21. Flandin's speech first stated that the bill to extend military service passed by the Chamber of Deputies would extend the service period for new recruits enlisting in April 1935 to eighteen months, and the service period for new recruits enlisting thereafter would be extended to two years. He said that this measure was only to supplement the military strength stipulated in the conscription law of 1928 and was not intended to expand armaments. Then, regarding Germany's rearmament, Flandin said, "Shall we tolerate Germany's rearmament? Shall we tolerate the bankruptcy of the disarmament conference? If this is tolerable, what is not tolerable? It is well known that France has always strived to implement disarmament under the conditions of mutual security guarantees. Now, people are unaware and think that Germany's declaration of the abolition of the military clauses of the treaty is a response to the British White Paper and France's extension of military service. They do not know that the establishment of the twelve corps of the German army has been nearly a year, and now it is only formally announced. If this announcement by Germany is accepted by the world, then all peace undertakings based on the League of Nations will be destroyed without exception. As far as we French are concerned, we will never allow Germany to accept this approach. For fifteen years, the French government has spared no effort to promote the cooperation of the two major nations of France and Germany, but the result has been the opposite. France is willing to compromise with Germany, but it is not within the power of France to compromise by despising the truth and denying legal justice. The world will have its own assessment of who is bearing the cost of inciting war. The trust and cooperation between the French and German peoples is indeed what we hope for, but it is futile to talk about trust and cooperation if we abandon our due responsibilities. Furthermore, some people say that France has not fulfilled its obligations to reduce armaments, so Germany has had to rearm. This statement is even more inaccurate. Has the world forgotten that France's standing army has been reduced by 50% since the war? Has the world also forgotten that France's military service period has been reduced from three years to one year? It should be known that France has always looked forward to disarmament like a severe drought looking for rain clouds. The reason why France cannot further reduce its armaments is simply because Germany is rearming. Some people believe that Germany has already fulfilled its obligations under the Treaty of Versailles. This is also definitely not the truth. Germany has superficially reduced its armaments, but in fact, it has been rearming at all times. The world knows that Germany is secretly expanding its armaments, but Germany does not want to admit it publicly. As for France's abandonment of several major clauses of the Treaty of Versailles over the years, what more needs to be said? Unfortunately, Germany has forgotten them all. Today, if people must distort historical facts to prove their sincere desire for cooperation, they can only see that their efforts are becoming increasingly exhausted. Moreover, which country is Germany threatened by that it must rearm? France requests the League of Nations to deal with this serious action, not for the benefit of France itself, but for the common benefit of all countries. World peace is based on justice. Without justice, peace cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, what we are worried about is no longer the problem between France and Germany, but the problem of collective peace. France has sufficient strength to defend its country and to meet the needs of its allies. In addition, there is no shortage of small and weak countries in Europe. If we sit idly by and allow power to replace public reason without taking remedial action, then these small and weak countries will definitely not have a chance to survive. Modifying treaties within the scope of equality among countries is not impossible. France abhors war. We will adopt all measures necessary to maintain peace. From now on, all of us French people should unite with the sacred concept of patriotism, because military preparation and spiritual preparation cannot be separated. Germany's spiritual preparation is an example. Those who oppose the army and the country should be regarded as treason. If propaganda is carried out in the colonies to make the people oppose France, it will be even more intolerable to us. Let us quickly arouse the spirit of patriotism, gather the strength of spirit and matter, and dedicate ourselves to peace, so that the whole world will know that France is united and cannot be easily humiliated. This is what we earnestly hope for," etc. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Officials here have no anxiety over French Premier Flandin's major attack on Germany in the Senate, because his wording is completely emotional. Moreover, up to now, we only know the summary of the French Premier's speech and have not seen the whole picture, so it inevitably increases its threatening tone. (National Telegraph, 21st)</p>

<h3>French Aviation Minister Requests Additional 1.6 Billion Francs for Military Expenses: Bill to be Submitted to the Chamber of Deputies Soon to Increase Aircraft to 1,500</h3>
<p>(Paris) According to Aviation Minister General Denain, France, in view of Germany's recent actions, cannot delay the expansion of its air force any longer. The requested additional funding of 1.6 billion francs can increase France's aircraft from 1,100 to 1,500. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>(Paris) In view of Germany's rearmament, the French government has decided to ask Congress to approve 1.6 billion francs to expand the air force. Aviation Minister General Denain announced today that the bill will be submitted to the Chamber of Deputies soon, and said that special attention will be paid to bombers. The funds requested by the government are additional to the budget passed last November. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>(Paris) Aviation Minister Denain told the French Chamber of Deputies Aviation Committee today that he will soon propose a bill requesting the immediate use of 1 trillion francs in next year's funds to expand the French Air Force, and will also request an additional 500 million francs, so that the French Air Force's military expenses, including the original 2 trillion francs, will reach a total of 3.5 trillion francs. (National Telegraph, 21st)</p>
<h3>French and Italian Panic Towards England Slightly Recovered: Gradually Forming a Common Front Against Germany</h3>
<p>(Paris) There is a possibility that England, France, and Italy will now organize a common front to deal with the crisis caused by Germany's rearmament. British Lord Privy Seal Eden is scheduled to come here on Saturday to exchange views with French Foreign Minister Laval and Italian Undersecretary of State Suvich. England's decision to send Eden to consult with Laval and Suvich has slightly recovered the panic of France and Italy caused by the British note to Germany. The attention is all focused on the British note being too mild. It is said that France sent a note to England on Sunday to explore the possibility of appealing to the League of Nations or using other plans to deal with Germany's implementation of compulsory military service. The British government did not respond and sent a note to Germany to protest, and did not discuss it with France beforehand. All sectors in France were very angry. Therefore, when Laval discussed with the British Ambassador and the Italian representative in Paris yesterday, he directly stated everything without concealment. The two countries both strongly advocated that England should consult with them before Foreign Secretary Simon goes to Germany on the due date. Therefore, England followed this opinion. It is now heard that after Simon returns from Germany, Simon or Eden will probably go to Rome to meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, and the consultation between the two governments will continue non-stop. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>(Rome) Before and after British Foreign Secretary Simon and Lord Privy Seal Eden go to Germany and Russia for visits, a three-way meeting of England, France, and Italy will be held twice. The Italian side welcomes this proposal very much. Italy has always been prudent in its actions and does not want to fall into Germany's trap. Today's decision to hold a three-way meeting of England, France, and Italy should be regarded as England, France, and Italy having formed a united front, while not closing the door to German cooperation. The general public believes that Foreign Secretary Simon's visit to Germany, although only related to England, is actually shouldering a major responsibility, and the experience gained is sufficient for the governments of various countries to refer to. As for France's application to the League of Nations, the Italian side is in close contact with France. The Italian government will announce its views tomorrow, but it is heard that it will not oppose the application to the League of Nations. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<h3>Analysis of the Opinions of the Three British Parties on Germany: The Conservative Party Has Doubts</h3>
<p>(London) Regarding Germany's declaration of rearmament and the British government's note to Germany, a debate will be held in the House of Commons today. According to information obtained by Havas, the Conservative, Liberal, and Labour parties will all agree with the section in the government's note to Germany regarding Germany's abolition of the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles. However, the Conservative Party still has doubts about Germany. The leader of the anti-government faction of the party, former Foreign Secretary Chamberlain, originally wanted to criticize the government for not consulting with France and Italy before deciding to send Foreign Secretary Simon to Germany. However, after hearing that representatives from England, France, and Italy will hold a meeting in Paris this Saturday, the Conservative Party's opposition faction was very satisfied. Therefore, Chamberlain has decided not to criticize the government again. The attitude of the Liberal Party's opposition faction can be seen in the opinion of its leader, Sir Samuel. The party was quite worried when it heard that Germany had restored compulsory military service. Later, because Germany responded to the British note and agreed that British cabinet members would visit Germany, the Liberal Party's opposition faction was very satisfied. Therefore, it will agree with the government's note to Germany. What the party is most concerned about now is whether England, France, and Italy can form a united front at the Paris meeting. As for the Labour Party's opposition faction, its leader, Lansbury, will speak. The party is satisfied with the government's note to Germany, but still has doubts about several points: (1) Whether England, France, and Italy can unite at the Paris meeting; (2) Whether the government will give greater consideration to respecting international treaties than to the actual situation; (3) Whether the procedures set out in the Anglo-French Declaration will be restricted, thereby reducing the possibility of concluding an agreement, so that the various issues inherited from the European War cannot be resolved.

<h3>Roosevelt May Also Protest Against Germany: Cautious Due to Domestic Politics</h3>
<p>(Washington) Regarding Germany's rearmament, President Roosevelt tends to protest to Germany. The President believes that this expression may avoid or delay the severity of the European situation. However, Roosevelt must be very cautious about this move due to domestic political constraints. Roosevelt's enemies fear that this move will create a "precedent," causing the United States to be dragged into the vortex of European disputes in the future, and use this to attack the President. Therefore, the general public believes that the President will wait until the European political situation is slightly clearer, especially after the results of British Foreign Secretary Simon's visit to Russia are clear, before taking appropriate action. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>(Washington) Whether the United States can issue a protest against Germany's violation of the Treaty of Versailles is still being debated by the authorities. However, plans to increase the US naval and land forces have been rushed to completion. Naval Affairs Committee Chairman Vinson announced today that he intends to propose to the House of Representatives: (1) Consolidate the bases in the Pacific; (2) Develop a sufficient naval force to provide the United States with the personnel needed to build all ships in accordance with the treaty; (3) Train sufficient aviators to fly the gradually increasing number of aircraft. House Military Committee Chairman Rodgers has asked the House to consider proposals to establish aviation bases in the United States, Alaska, and Panama, and to form a strong army. Experts in the government cannot agree on the issue of Germany's decision to rearm. Several people expressed their opinions in a private capacity, believing that the US government should recognize Germany's actions as dissatisfaction. Diplomatic advisers believe that the United States has reasons for communication, but it is heard that the authorities very much want to stay out of the matter and not get involved in European disputes. The White House is also said to advocate that the United States should not interfere in any overseas entanglements. According to news here today, the United States may not send observers to the meeting of politicians from England, France, and Italy to be held in Paris on Saturday. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>(Washington) International observers here today expect that the demand for the return of pre-war territories will be Germany's second step. Officials believe that the territories abandoned by Germany include the Pacific islands currently under the trusteeship of Japan. If Germany makes this request, it will have a serious dispute with Japan. The diplomatic community deeply believes that the German government is determined to restore its past position, so it may request the return of territories in order to rejoin the League of Nations. Moreover, in Europe, Hitler may request that the method of the Saar region be used in Austria and the Free City of Danzig, that is, to hold a referendum. President Roosevelt is very well informed about the European situation. In his conversation with the press, he said that the United States will not send a note to Germany, and believes that in the current situation, the United States' "Good Neighbor Policy" may become an important component of the world disarmament movement. The President finally stated that the disarmament movement in Geneva has made great progress, and hopes that the League of Nations can have definite achievements in this matter.

<h3>German Defense Minister States: Restore Pre-War Military Strength, Tell the People to Prepare for National Affairs</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Defense Minister General von Blomberg published an article in the Vossische Zeitung today, outlining the path that Germany will take to vigorously implement conscription in the future. Since the German government issued an important declaration last Saturday, millions of people have been asking each other about this matter. Blomberg stated, "In the future, Germany's universal compulsory military service will be implemented in accordance with the principles of the National Socialist state." The so-called implementation in accordance with the principles of the National Socialist state means that the national defense organization will restore the original system before the war, because the vision of the National Socialist state is to permanently move forward and never look back. Therefore, people who have received higher education will not be able to shorten their military service as before, only character and achievement can determine the career and value of each individual. The detailed explanation has been fully described in the book "German Military Career". Blomberg also said that since national defense is a major event in which all people participate, there is no doubt that the future will be strong and united. In the future, the potential strength and thoughts in the minds of the people will tend to be consistent and closely integrated. Therefore, the effectiveness of national defense strength is in the present, but it is preparing for the future achievements of the country. (National Telegraph, 20th)</p>
<h3>German Espionage Work: National Socialists Mixed into Various Swedish Parties</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden - The authorities recently conducted a major search in the Gothenburg branch of the Swedish National Socialist Party, which was set up by workers. According to the documents and letters seized, it is known that the National Socialist Party set up this branch to engage in secret espionage work to undermine enemy parties. According to the description in the documents, it can be seen that there are National Socialist Party members mixed in among the various parties, and their secret work is to list the names of the enemy party members of the National Socialist Party and compile them into a "blacklist". Furthermore, the correspondence between the branch and the German National Socialist Workers' Organization proves that the German National Socialist Party once instructed the Swedish National Socialist Party to carry out political espionage missions for the German National Socialist Party.

<h3>Lord Lytton on Russian, Japanese, and German Relations: Emphasizing the Importance of Soviet Russia Joining the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(London) Former Director of the League of Nations Far East Incident Investigation Team, Lord Lytton, told a reporter for Pravda, "Cooperation to seek peace cannot be achieved without the participation of the Soviet Union. Therefore, I believe that the Soviet Union's accession to the League of Nations is an extremely important event. At the same time, we must not forget that it is extremely valuable for the Soviet Union to be able to cooperate in the Disarmament Conference. It is extremely clear that the Soviet Union has no plans to invade neighboring countries. The words of politicians in Japan and Germany clearly show that Japan intends to expand westward, while Germany is eyeing the east. They are moving forward to your country. I strongly disapprove of this anti-Soviet alliance between Japan and Germany. Litvinov once said that peace is indivisible, and at the same time, today's wars cannot be limited to local events. I fully agree with this point." Lord Lytton also expressed his support for the establishment of an effective security organization. He particularly supported the Eastern Mutual European Convention, because if this move can be realized, it will be a major victory for the guarantee of peace. (TASS, 20th)</p>
<h3>Berlin Air Defense Drill: People's Discipline Strict, Calm</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The air defense drill began last night and continued this morning. Residents strictly adhered to the orders issued by the Aviation Ministry. The strict discipline was truly impressive, and it is believable that in the event of real danger, the people will obey the authorities and remain calm. During this morning's drill, enemy aircraft were simulated attacking, with thick black, red, and blue smoke representing bomb explosions, burning houses, and suffocating gas. Upon hearing the alarm, residents immediately stopped their daily activities and rushed to the cellars, with police guarding the entrances to prevent anyone from going out. The drill lasted more than six hours before it ended. (March 20th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>American-Russian Relations</h3>
<p>(Washington) Since the failure of the US-Russian debt negotiations, some in the United States have launched a movement to sever relations with Russia. Both the Senate and the House of Representatives have proposed bills to cut off relations with Russia. The State Department does not approve of this action, arguing that this is a matter within the President's purview. If these bills are passed, US-Russian relations will be hampered. However, the initiators of the bill have ignored this. Secretary of State Hull stated today that the United States will continue to recognize the Soviet Union. The US Ambassador to Russia, Bullitt, is currently on leave in the United States and will return to Moscow next week to resume his duties. It is expected that Bullitt will reopen debt negotiations upon his return to Russia, but whether he has special instructions is currently unknown. (March 21st, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Soviet Aviation Industry</h3>
<p>(Moscow dispatch from TASS, February 26th) Before 1928, the Soviet Union relied heavily on foreign countries for aviation equipment. However, today, all civilian and military aircraft used in the Soviet Union are domestically produced. At the same time, there has been great progress in manufacturing styles. There are three aviation research institutes engaged in this research, with the Moscow Central Aerodynamic Institute being the most prominent. A flying boat manufacturing plant was established in 1931, and the first batch of five experimental flying boats manufactured there range in volume from 2,150 cubic meters to 6,800 cubic meters. Soviet civil aviation is developing rapidly, so the training of pilots and technicians is also essential. The Soviet Union currently has several aviation schools that train various flight personnel. The general public's interest in aviation is growing daily. The most widespread organization is the "Society of Friends of Aviation," with millions of members. The public enthusiastically donates to aviation construction. Interest in aircraft research at high altitudes is growing. In 1933, there was the famous flight of the Soviet Union's "Winged Sphere" balloon, followed by the "Society of Friends of Aviation" balloon in 1934. The Soviet Union's operating air routes will expand to 85,000 kilometers by 1937 (compared to 37,000 kilometers in 1933), and local air routes will increase to 35,000 kilometers (compared to 14,000 kilometers in 1933). The volume of airmail and passenger traffic will increase by 10 to 35 times compared to 1933.</p>
<h3>Hitler's Special Envoy Did Not Go to England</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Rumors circulated that Hitler's special envoy on disarmament issues, Ribbentrop, would go to London today to meet with British Foreign Secretary Simon and Liberal Party leader Lord Lothian.

<p>(Harbin) Savloff, the Deputy Director of Accounting in the General Affairs Department of the Chinese Eastern Railway, committed suicide with a handgun at his residence today because he did not want to return home in a few days. However, as he was an extreme left-wing communist, it is believed that there must be complex circumstances involved. (March 21st, Telecom dispatch)</p>

<h3>March 21st, Reuters Special Commercial Dispatch</h3>
<p>Gold and Silver</p>
<p>London gold prices fell by one shilling, eight and a half pence yesterday, seeming to have fallen too sharply. Today, with the pound sterling weak, gold prices have recovered, reaching one hundred and forty-six shillings, ten and a half pence, an increase of one shilling, four and a half pence from yesterday.</p>
<p>The London silver market has also shown improvement. Prices fell yesterday but rebounded today. Spot prices are twenty-seven pence, one eight seven five, up 〇 point 〇 six two five; futures prices are twenty-seven pence, three one two five, up point one two five. There were few sellers, and purchases from China were the reason for the price increase, as well as the weak pound sterling.</p>
<p>Exchange Rates</p>
<p>The London foreign exchange market was panicky this morning, with frequent price fluctuations, but not very drastic. Trading volume was low. The opening exchange rate for the US dollar against the British pound was four dollars, seventy-six cents, two five, lower by six two five than the closing rate for the US dollar against the British pound yesterday. After a slight increase, prices mostly declined before noon. The price at 2:00 PM was four dollars, seventy-four cents, nine three seven five, lower by one cent, three two two five than the opening price.</p>
<p>The opening price for the British pound against the French franc was seventy-two francs, one eight, lower by three pounds and eleven pence than yesterday. Prices recovered slightly at 11:00 AM, then declined again. The price at 1:00 PM was seventy-one francs, eight four. At 2:00 PM, it rose by ten pounds to seventy-one francs, nine four, which was still lower by twenty-four pounds than the opening price this morning.</p>
<p>In the New York foreign exchange market, the opening exchange rate for the US dollar against the British pound was four dollars, seventy-six cents, one two five, lower by seven five than yesterday. The French franc rose by two five, reaching six dollars, fifty-nine and a half cents. There was a considerable atmosphere of panic in the market, as the turmoil in Europe caused instability for the British pound and gold coins. The British pound fell to four dollars, seventy-six cents shortly afterward. Market prices remained stable within an hour of the opening.</p>
<p>Cotton and Wheat</p>
<p>New York: Secretary of Agriculture Wallace announced that the government's cotton production policy remains unchanged. This statement should be beneficial to the multi-party. However, the cotton market did not receive a good influence today. The uncertainty of the European situation and foreign sales are the two major factors for the poor performance of the cotton market. Although the opening price rose several points, it soon fell below yesterday's closing price. Fortunately, most of the sales were absorbed, so prices could be maintained. Foreign operators then bought in slightly, and prices rose slightly. In addition, a lot of industry insiders were buying.</p>
<p>Chicago: There were reports of dust storms again affecting Chicago wheat today, and there is a possibility of poor harvests. Therefore, although the Department of Agriculture canceled the restrictions on spring wheat this year, the opening price was still stable. Winnipeg rose point one two five because of the weak pound sterling and slightly higher prices in Liverpool. There were some purchases in the Chicago wheat market before noon, but they were mostly speculative.</p>
<p>Liverpool Wheat: Although there was disturbing news in the United States about the cancellation of spring wheat restrictions, there was still a lot of trading in the Liverpool wheat market today, and prices rose slightly. At 1:00 PM, the price for the May contract was five shillings, one and a half pence, up half a penny from yesterday.</p>
<p>Liverpool Cotton: Because of good sentiment today, there were still many buyers, so prices also rose. At 1:00 PM, the price for the May contract was six pence, one two, higher by eight points than yesterday's closing price.</p>
<p>Rubber</p>
<p>London: The market situation was light today. At noon, the trading price for the July and September contracts was five pence, six two five, lower by point one two five than yesterday's closing price.</p>
<p>New York: Today's forward contracts fell by ten points, and then fell by another ten points in less than half an hour. This is because although the British pound has a weak trend, the London rubber market price has fallen instead.</p>
<p>Securities</p>
<p>New York: Trading was inactive at the opening today, with the situation as it was yesterday. Prices mostly trended downward, and sentiment showed no improvement. The unsettled situation in Europe continues to have a restrictive impact on the market here. The New York stock market prices are listed on the left:</p>

<h3>Roosevelt to Approve Philippine Constitution Tomorrow; After Acceptance by the People of the Philippines and Elections, a Republican Government will be Formed Recognizing US Sovereignty</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt will approve the Philippine Constitution on Saturday, which is the first step towards the complete independence of the Philippines within ten or twelve years. Philippine Senate representatives Quezon and others will attend the grand ceremony for the approval of the constitution. After the Philippine General Assembly accepts this constitution and elections are held, the Philippines will organize a republican government, with the date set for December 30th. The current Philippine Governor-General will serve as a special envoy to the Philippines for several months. It is noted that this constitution stipulates a republican system for the Philippines and recognizes US sovereignty. Philippine officials must swear allegiance to the United States. (March 21st, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Associated Press learned today that commercial talks between US officials and the Philippine delegation have been temporarily suspended while awaiting the United States to decide on its domestic and foreign commercial policies and clarify the international and Far Eastern situation. One of the most difficult points to resolve is that, although the American people have expressed goodwill towards the Filipinos in economic and political aspects, it is practically impossible for the two governments to jointly decide on the policies to be implemented. The President's Good Neighbor Policy is currently the only policy that the Philippine side agrees to. The United States hopes to maintain friendship with South America, the Far East, and Europe through this policy. Qualified observers here say that the Philippine parliament fears foreign opposition to close commercial understanding between the US and the Philippines, and may not take any action to protect American goods on the island thereafter. (March 20th, National News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Official circles in Washington continued to study the Philippine issue today. The House Committee on Insular Affairs, chaired by Congressman Gaviersky, began its work. It is said that the committee will soon hear opinions from all sectors of the Philippines. The Senate passed the first Philippine appropriation bill, of which $255,000 is for the expenses of the US envoy stationed in the Philippines after the establishment of the Philippine Republic. However, the House only passed $165,000, and this matter will be decided by a joint conference of the two houses. Committee member McClark discussed the Philippine issue with President Roosevelt and later declared that he would prepare a report based on the results of his inspection of the Philippines. Governor-General Murphy and Secretary of Agriculture Wallace discussed a plan to use 3.5 million sugar tax dollars to improve Philippine agriculture for a long time and dined with Secretary of State Philip to discuss Far Eastern commercial issues.

<h3>Japanese Ambassador to the United States Speaks on Sino-Japanese Cooperation</h3>
<p>(New York) Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saito spoke today at a banquet of the Japan Society, saying that human psychology is gradually leaning towards peace, and the understanding that war is useless and the gradual extension of justice in international events are the reasons for the new concept of mankind. Statues of generals have been replaced by monuments to nameless heroes, and the mantra of "Right or wrong, I love my country" is no longer accepted by those who value self-respect. Peace and war compete with each other, but he has no doubt about the results. Saito then spoke of the situation in the Far East, saying that the time has come for Sino-Japanese cooperation. China and Japan should be close friends, which is in the best interest of both parties. If Japan can help China consolidate its domestic situation, the whole world will benefit from it. Not only will the Chinese people benefit, but also the commercial and financial activities of Europe and the United States in China will be facilitated and encouraged.

<h3>Another Incident Occurs in Italian Somaliland, Demanding Compensation from Abyssinia</h3>
<p>(Rome) Another incident occurred in Italian Somaliland, worsening the relationship between Italy and Abyssinia. Rome has just received news that a team of armed Abyssinians invaded Italian territory south of the Yabis Qubi River and looted a hundred camels. These people's ambitions are obviously not limited to this area. However, upon seeing the appearance of a detachment of soldiers belonging to the garrison of Italian Somaliland, they hastily retreated, and fired shots at the pursuing detachment during their escape. Fortunately, there were no casualties. Although this incident is not as serious as the previous two conflicts that occurred in Uruel, the Italians are quite indignant. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, upon receiving this news, immediately instructed the Foreign Ministry to demand compensation from the Abyssinian government. (March 21st, Reuters dispatch)</p>

Labour MP Wynn suggested that the committee should investigate the inspection and registration system implemented in Hong Kong, and said that if the current inspectors are insufficient, their number should be increased. Lister replied that the committee would have general instructions to investigate not only specific points, but also the entire issue. If the committee believes that the number of inspectors should be increased, it will have the right to request an increase. (March 20th, Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>Jinan: Ancient Bronze Artifact Discovered</h3>
<p>Shaped like a bronze basin, it can emit sound and spray water when rubbed by hand; numerous archaeologists have studied it but cannot explain its principle.</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Shandong is the ancient state of Qi and Lu, the cradle of Chinese culture, and ancient artifacts are frequently discovered. In the spring of the previous year, thirteen Western Zhou bronze artifacts were discovered in Teng County, causing a nationwide sensation. Recently, a Mr. Zhu in this city also possesses an ancient bronze artifact that is quite peculiar. The following describes its appearance, unique features, and origins:</p>
<p>Shape and Peculiarities</p>
<p>The artifact is round, made of yellow bronze, with an ancient and mottled appearance. It is about the size of an ordinary basin, about half a foot tall, with thirteen characters in relief in the style of inscriptions on ancient bronze vessels. After examination, the first character is "Zhou," and the last character is "Bi," while the rest are unrecognizable. It has two ears, and the bottom of the artifact has a circle, with five bars outside the circle, and four bronze fish cast outside the bars. According to the owner, the circle symbolizes the Taiji, the five bars symbolize the Five Elements, the four fish symbolize the Four Symbols, and the two ears symbolize the Two Instruments. Most remarkably, when water is filled in the vessel and the two ears are rubbed with both hands, it emits a buzzing sound, and the water inside bubbles like boiling water. The longer it is rubbed, the louder the sound becomes, and it can be heard with rising and falling tones, like playing a piano. At the same time, the bronze fish inside the vessel spray water from their mouths above the water surface. If rubbed by an energetic and robust person, the water sprays higher, about two feet, from four points, which is quite a spectacle. If rubbed by an old and weak person, the water sprays lower, and the sound is also softer.</p>
<p>Origins of the Artifact</p>
<p>It is said that the artifact was discovered quite early. During the late Qing Dynasty, Zhang Jian (also known as Zhang Ji Zhi) organized an exposition in Beijing, where various strange objects were displayed. This artifact was also displayed in a separate room, and viewers marveled at it but could not understand its principle. The original owner was a military man, and the current owner, Mr. Zhu, was also serving in the military at that time. He took great notice of it. Not long after, the original owner passed away, and his family sold it to Mr. Zhu for two to three thousand yuan. Mr. Zhu cherished it and brought it to Jinan for safekeeping, not showing it to others. When Zhang Zongchang was in Shandong, someone leaked the information to Zhang, who sent someone to suggest offering him a certain position in exchange. Mr. Zhu then took the artifact to Tianjin. Later, Chu Yupu also learned about it and wanted to acquire it, offering Mr. Zhu a position in exchange. Mr. Zhu secretly deposited the artifact in a bank safe and went to Shanghai alone, hiding his name and staying out of sight. Through numerous moves and expenses, he had already spent a considerable amount of money. Recently, Mr. Zhu's finances have become strained, and he intends to sell it.</p>
<p>Verifications from Various Sources</p>
<p>The owner initially thought it was a rare treasure and was unwilling to show it easily, asking for 50,000 yuan. Later, Wang Xiantang, a librarian at the Provincial Library and an archaeologist, determined that it was an artifact from the Song or Yuan Dynasty, at most from the Tang Dynasty, and definitely not from the Three Dynasties, and that the characters were forged by later generations. However, he could not explain the principle behind the spraying water and sound. Because physics and chemistry had not been greatly developed in the Song and Yuan Dynasties, it was impossible to create this object. Previously, Zhang Taiyan had thoroughly researched this artifact in the "Miscellaneous Notes" section of the National Essence Journal he published in Shanghai, but he was unable to make any discoveries or determine its name. Chen Yuan'an, president of Fu Jen Catholic University in Beiping and a renowned expert in archaeology, especially skilled in identifying ancient bronzes, was asked to study it via letter. Chen replied that the spraying water and sound were due to the action of electricity. The bronze material of the artifact must contain a metallic element that transmits electricity very quickly. Human hands have electricity, so rubbing it transmits electricity to the water, causing it to make sound and spray water. However, with the advancement of modern science, no one has yet discovered a metal that transmits electricity so quickly, and it is astonishing that people in the Yuan Dynasty in China invented it. If it is proven to be a bronze artifact from the Three Dynasties, it would be an even rarer treasure, because it would prove that people in China during the Three Dynasties were able to utilize electricity to create this object. Chen also said in his letter that if there are defects on the artifact and red rust is found inside, it can prove that it is a bronze artifact from the Three Dynasties, because if it is not from the Three Dynasties, it will only have green rust and no red rust. The reporter carefully examined the artifact and found a defect about the size of a bean, inside which there was indeed red rust, so it is possible that it is a bronze artifact from the Three Dynasties. In short, whether the artifact is from the Three Dynasties or not, it is certainly an artifact from the Song or Yuan Dynasty. People in China during the Song and Yuan Dynasties were able to discover a metal that transmits electricity the fastest, which has not yet been discovered in the 20th century, and were able to utilize it to create this object, which is of great significance and research value to Chinese culture.</p>
<p>Not One of a Kind</p>
<p>Recently, the Guangzhiyuan, established by foreigners in this city, also purchased a similar object from Henan, but it is slightly smaller. When rubbed by hand, it can also emit sound and spray water, but the sound is softer, and the water sprays lower. Henan is also the birthplace of ancient Chinese culture, so it is evident that this object is an ancient artifact. This is specially recorded to provide for the research of contemporary scientists.</p>
<h3>Lichang Shipping Company's Lichang Steamer Runs Aground in Japan Due to Fog</h3>
<p>The ship did not sink, and the crew was rescued; it was insured for 50,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the Lichang Steamer of Lichang Shipping Company, rented to a Japanese company, carrying cargo from Dalian to Moji in Japan, ran aground due to fog in the harbor waters the other day. Efforts are being made to rescue it. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Rented to a Japanese Company</p>
<p>Yongyuan Shipping Company's ships are the Yongyuan and Shunyuan, and it also acts as an agent for the Lichang and Lishun, for a total of four ships. They specialize in sailing to Shanghai, Dalian, Yantai, and other places. The head office is located in Dalian, and the Shanghai office is located in the Yongfengli Customs Brokerage on Sijing Road. Starting last year, in order to save expenses, the Shanghai office was closed, and the ships sailing to Shanghai were suspended. The Lichang and Lishun were also stopped being agents in the north. The Lichang was rented to a Japanese merchant by the Lichang Shipping Company to sail between Dalian and Moji, mainly for carrying cargo.</p>
<p>Runs Aground Due to Fog</p>
<p>The Lichang Steamer has a gross tonnage of 1,484 tons and a net tonnage of 815 tons. After being rented to a Japanese company, it carried cargo from Dalian to Moji in Japan. On the 20th of this month, at about 1:00 PM, when it reached the waters of Zhigang in Japan, it ran aground due to fog. The Japanese captain immediately sent a wireless call for help and inspected the point of impact. Although it was broken, and seawater was entering, it did not immediately sink because it was sitting on the reef.</p>
<p>Efforts to Rescue</p>
<p>After the Lichang Steamer ran aground, nearby Japanese ships have already provided assistance, and the cargo it was carrying has been unloaded. All the crew members, about thirty in number, except for the Japanese captain, are Chinese and have been rescued. It has been decided to enter the dock for repairs after it is out of danger. The head office of Lichang is located in Qingdao. After receiving the captain's telegram, they immediately telegraphed Japan to arrange for rescue.</p>
<p>Insured for 50,000</p>
<p>A Xin Sheng News Agency reporter learned from the China Ship Insurance Federation yesterday morning that the steamer had taken out a 50,000 yuan safety insurance policy with the Federation. However, after the ship ran aground, as of yesterday, the Lichang Company had not yet reported it. The Federation has decided to immediately telegraph the Lichang Company in Qingdao to inquire about the details of the grounding so that it can be investigated and processed.</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Red Cross Sends Refugees Back to Their Hometowns</h3>
<p>The Songjiang branch of the Red Cross Society's refugee camp for Zhejiang disaster victims, as spring plowing is approaching, refugees should be sent back to their hometowns to prepare for agricultural work. Repeated telegrams were sent to Zhejiang Chairman Huang Shaoxiong, requesting him to instruct officials from Haiyan and other counties to come to Songjiang to lead the refugees back to their farms. Chairman Huang expressed his gratitude for the Society's efforts to help neighbors and relieve disasters and approved a telegram order to inform the county governments. A few days ago, Jiang Huoyue, the magistrate of Haiyan County, Zhejiang, and the chief inspector came to Songjiang, visited the Society's mainstays Sheng Jingsheng, Zhu Jiuwang, Zhou Xuewen, and others, and inspected the refugees' accommodation situation, which was orderly and much appreciated. It is estimated that there are more than 2,000 refugees belonging to the county, who were sent back by train. The transportation costs were enormous. The director Zhou went to Shanghai to visit the chief of the traffic department of the Jinghu-Hangyong Railway Administration and requested 20 free cars, which were approved by the Ministry of Railways. On the 21st, the cars were connected to Songjiang. Before their departure, the refugees lined up and went to the county government to express their gratitude before going to the station to board the train. Mr. Qian and others distributed funds according to name. They set off at 4:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Yao Guangjun, Employee of Shanghai Municipal Bank, Commits Suicide by Drowning</h3>
<p>Yao Guangjun, 23 years old, a native of Suzhou and the younger brother of Yao Genghuan, the editor of the Shanghai Minbao's supplement, was an employee of the Shanghai Municipal Bank. His home in Suzhou was located at No. 87 Jiuxueqian. Yao Gengchen, Gengjun's second elder brother, was an employee of the Suzhou Tianye Bank. On the morning of the 8th of this month, Gengjun came to Suzhou from Shanghai and opened room number 39 at the Suzhou Hotel outside Changmen. He wrote a letter to his family in the room, vaguely expressing his intention to commit suicide. It is rumored that the reason was that Gengjun was addicted to dance halls in Shanghai, resulting in financial difficulties that could not be remedied. After his brother received the letter, he published an advertisement in the Suzhou newspaper on the 9th, the original text of which was: "To Fudi, I have read everything in your letter. The matter is still kept secret. I hope you turn back and come home to reunite. There are solutions for everything. From your brother, Xixiang." However, Gengjun went to Tiger Hill from the Suzhou Hotel on the 8th and never returned. Therefore, his family did not receive any further news from him. Until the afternoon of the 21st, Fang Shenzhi, a reporter from the Wuxian Daily, was passing by the Zhenzhuo Bridge on Tiger Hill and glimpsed a floating corpse in the river. Upon closer inspection, it was indeed a corpse, wearing a long gown and trousers, and still holding seven wheat straw fans in his hand. He reported to the police, who retrieved the body, reported to the court for inspection, and conducted an investigation. It was then learned that the deceased was Yao Guangjun. They went to the Suzhou Hotel to inquire and found a small package under the pillow on the bed in room number 39. Inside the package was a photo and a suicide note. His family was notified and came to handle everything.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Abnormal Weather, Spring Snow Flies</h3>
<p>The weather has been alternately warm and cold in recent days, with high and low temperatures changing from time to time. After the heavy fog the night before, the temperature suddenly rose, but by the morning of yesterday (20th), the temperature suddenly dropped, with a crisp north wind, as if it were the cold air of late winter and early spring. The Fahrenheit thermometer read 45 degrees. Around 11:00 PM, it began to drizzle, followed by snowflakes. By about 1:00 AM this morning, heavy snow was falling, which stopped only at 5:30 AM. The mountains and fields were covered in silver. However, this kind of spring snow is harmful and not beneficial to crops. There are quite a few cases of scarlet fever and meningitis in the city, and they are all being treated in various hospitals. According to doctors, these diseases are entirely caused by abnormal weather.</p>
<h3>Six People Drown in Overturned Boat in Taihu Lake</h3>
<p>Lishun Mountain Goods Store, located in Nantang, south of Qingming Bridge outside the South Gate, is owned by Chen Yaoshan. It has been in business for many years, and its business has been fairly good. Recently, as spring bamboo shoots came on the market, Chen sent his employees to Zhangzhu in Yixing to purchase a large batch of spring bamboo shoots in order to meet customer needs. They were transported by a large barge to Wuxi. Unexpectedly, fierce winds and waves struck for several days, and the weather suddenly turned cold. When they reached Taihu Lake, they were attacked by wind and waves and capsized. In addition to all the spring bamboo shoots being submerged, six crew members also drowned. Afterwards, someone reported the incident to Lishun Mountain Goods Store by telephone. After receiving the news, the store hired another boat yesterday to go to salvage the bodies and handle everything.</p>
<h3>Young Woman Takes Poison After Quarrel</h3>
<p>Du, a resident of Wantou, outside the South Gate, has been working as a clerk at the Xinxianyuan Rice Store in Beitang. He married Wang, 24 years old, and has three children. However, the couple's relationship has not been good, and quarrels often occur. The other day, Du had another quarrel with his wife and told Wang that he was going to marry another concubine and would no longer come home. Wang heard this and was extremely angry, and she conceived a pessimistic thought. Around 7:00 PM the other night, she secretly swallowed one yuan of raw opium and committed suicide. Later, she was discovered by her family and immediately sent to the Brothers Hospital for treatment. She has not yet escaped danger.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Young Woman Attempts Suicide by Taking Poison</h3>
<p>Huang Ying, a 17-year-old girl from a certain house on Dongpo Road in Hangzhou, recently suffered some kind of stimulation and suddenly conceived a pessimistic thought. The other night, taking advantage of the absence of others, she swallowed sleeping pills and committed suicide. The family members noticed and rushed her to the hospital for treatment. Fortunately, the poison had not penetrated deeply. After acupuncture and stomach pumping and other medical procedures, she was out of danger and was able to celebrate her rebirth.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Issues 100 Million Yuan of Public Bonds to Rescue the Market</h3>
<p>Replenishing the funds of the three banks to indirectly aid industry and commerce; the bank subcommittee discussed and decided on credit lending measures yesterday.</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that, regarding the issue of rescuing the market, the Ministry of Finance has decided to issue 100 million yuan of financial public bonds to replenish the funds of the three banks and regulate the market, with industry and commerce credit lending. The bank association subcommittee met yesterday and decided to persuade the Qianye Association to join and raise a syndicate to implement it. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Issuing Public Bonds to Bolster the Funds of the Three Banks</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has decided to issue 100 million yuan of financial public bonds of the Republic of China in 1935 to rescue industry and commerce, secured by customs revenue. It has been approved by the Central Political Council. Of these public bonds, 30 million yuan have been allocated to replenish the funds of the Central Bank, 25 million yuan to replenish the funds of the Bank of China, and 10 million yuan to replenish the funds of the Bank of Communications, so that the funds of the three banks can be increased to strengthen themselves in order to circulate finance and regulate the market. The financial circles in Shanghai have expressed their approval of the Ministry of Finance issuing public bonds to rescue the market and replenish the funds of the three banks. Once implemented, the fear of a shortage of funds in the market can be reduced, so that industry and commerce can gradually restore their original state.</p>
<p>Three Banks Offer Lending to Rescue the Market</p>
<p>The Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, in the final accounts of 1934, designated a huge amount of money to rescue the market, to be used for mortgage lending to the silver and money industries, which is still continuing. However, the total amount is less than 10 million yuan. Now the three banks have decided to further increase the amount of money after the financial public bonds of 100 million yuan are issued, to be used for mortgage lending to the silver and money industries. Although it is directly lending to the silver and money industries, it is indirectly lending to industry and commerce, because after the silver and money industries obtain the money, their own strength will be strengthened, and their ability to lend to industry and commerce will also increase.</p>
<p>Bank Subcommittee Held a Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>The subcommittee organized by the bankers association on the industrial and commercial credit small loan of 5 million yuan held its first meeting at the association on Hong Kong Road at 2:00 PM yesterday. The attendees were committee members Chen Guangfu, Tang Shoumin, Bei Songsun, Ye Fuxiao, Xu Jiying, Wang Yansong, and six others. Lin Kanghou, the secretary-general of the association, attended as an observer. All the committee members agreed that industrial and commercial credit small loans should be implemented quickly to provide assistance. The following resolutions were made: (1) A letter will be sent to persuade the members of the Qianye Association to continue to increase their lending appropriately to cooperate, otherwise, the member banks will recognize the amount in full. (2) A syndicate of industrial and commercial credit small lenders will be formed immediately, striving to hold it as soon as possible. (3) The procedure is that all applicants must first fill out a three-part application form, send it to the local association and the municipal chamber of commerce for approval, and then send it to the syndicate for review and approval. The designated member bank will then pay the loan. The meeting adjourned at 3:00 PM.</p>
<p>Loan Syndicate is Being Organized</p>
<p>A Xin Sheng News Agency reporter learned from the silver and money industries yesterday that the Qianye Association has decided not to join the syndicate in the industrial and commercial credit small loan case after a temporary meeting of member representatives. They have now advised member banks to expand their lending as much as possible. As for the bank association's resolution to persuade them to join the syndicate, no letter has been received as of last night. After receiving the letter, it will be submitted to the executive committee for discussion. As for the bank association, it has decided to set up the fund with the Central Bank of the government. The total amount is 5 million yuan, with the Central Bank responsible for 2.5 million yuan, and the member banks of the association jointly responsible for 2.5 million yuan. It would be best if the members of the Qianye Association can take part of it.</p>
<p>Implementation of Assistance, Hope for Revival</p>
<p>The local association, the municipal chamber of commerce, etc., have decided on five concrete measures to provide assistance, and they have all been gradually implemented. Regarding cargo mortgages, the silver and money industries have been doing as much as possible. The Central Bank has sent a letter to the municipal chamber of commerce saying that acceptance bill discounting can be done according to the regulations. The industrial and commercial credit loan syndicate has been organized and will be realized soon. Now the Ministry of Finance has decided to issue public bonds to replenish the funds of the three banks and regulate the market. Therefore, after the efforts of all parties, there is no problem regarding rescuing the market. The foreign exchange rate in the money market yesterday has dropped to six points, and there is hope for the revival of industry and commerce.</p>
<h3>Pan Yangyao's Remarks</h3>
<p>The Decline of Industry and Commerce</p>
<p>The situation is not as bad as rumors suggest; the biggest reasons are no more than three points.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that industry and commerce in this city are declining, and appeals have been made to find ways to provide assistance. The Ministry of Finance, for the sake of assistance, has submitted a proposal to the Central Political Council to issue 100 million yuan of financial public bonds. At the same time, the banking circles in this city will also contribute 5 million yuan together with the Ministry of Finance to provide loans for assistance. In order to understand the decline of industry and commerce in this city, a Central News Agency reporter paid a special visit to Pan Yangyao, who is familiar with industry and commerce in this city, yesterday morning. According to Pan's findings, the decline of industry and commerce in this city is not as bad as rumors suggest. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Decline Situation</p>
<p>According to Pan, in this time of economic downturn, the decline of industry and commerce in this city is to be expected. It is not just industry and commerce that is like this, but all industries are in this state. The decline of industry and commerce is much exaggerated in recent rumors. According to my own investigation, I dare not fully believe the rumors to be true. According to a survey of industry and commerce throughout the city, the recent business situation is that more than 40% are profitable, 30% can obtain official interest, and the rest are losing money. This situation is inconsistent with the rumors. However, if assistance is not provided immediately, the future of industry and commerce will be dire. Therefore, the financial authorities and the financial circles of this city will provide financial assistance in practice.</p>
<p>Biggest Reasons</p>
<p>As for the decline of industry and commerce, although the reasons vary, the most important ones are no more than three points. The first point is meager interest. According to the price statistics of the Jincheng Bank in this city, last year's prices were 10 to 16 percent lower than the previous year. With lower prices, interest is naturally meager. The second point is the accumulation of inventory. In recent years, the purchasing power of the market has been weak, so inventory is piled up like mountains, putting aside part of the cost. After the goods are sold, they are given to the merchants, and the payment cannot be received for a while, which puts aside another part of the cost. At the same time, the purchase of raw materials also puts aside another part of the cost. The third point is competition among the same industry. Recently, competition among the same industry has become increasingly fierce, often causing the selling price to fall below the cost. With industry and commerce in this kind of layer-by-layer suffering, it is declining day by day.</p>
<p>Methods of Assistance</p>
<p>People in industry and commerce have gradually understood this kind of layer-by-layer suffering, and they are now doing their best to find ways to provide assistance. They are even more saddened by the point of competition among the same industry. Therefore, a group of industry and commerce leaders has consulted several times, and they all agree that in order to avoid competition among the same industry, it is necessary to first know the sales and production numbers of the goods in that industry and restrict each other so that the production number is suitable for the sales number, so as to avoid the accumulation of inventory. At the same time, they must unite the ambition of competition among the same industry and compete with foreign goods, so that all malpractices can be avoided.</p>
<p>Loans for Factories</p>
<p>For the sake of their own interests, the silver and money industries must, of course, be careful when lending to industry and commerce, which makes it even more difficult for industry and commerce whose capital turnover is not smooth. Some people in the industry have advocated organizing groups to borrow money from the silver and money industries, but it is difficult to predict when it will be implemented. For example, more than ten factories are united to form a lending group to borrow a certain amount of money from the silver and money industries. If one of the factories in the group goes bankrupt or cannot repay the money, the remaining factories will be jointly responsible for compensating for the debt. In this way, the silver and money industries can lend to industry and commerce with peace of mind, and the industry and commerce economy can also be more flexible.</p>
<h3>Hunan Province's Public Bonds Mortgage Loan of 1 Million Yuan Was Agreed Upon Yesterday</h3>
<p>Undertaken by the Central, China, and Communications Banks; contract signed today, interest at 8%, repayable in two years.</p>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports that Zhang Kailian, Director of the Finance Department of Hunan Province, and Yu Jizhuan, Director of the Construction Department, hosted a banquet for the banking community at the Banking Association yesterday afternoon to discuss public bond mortgages. As a result of the consultation, it was decided that the Central, China, and Communications Banks would first lend 1 million yuan. The contract is scheduled to be signed today, and negotiations will continue for the remaining amount. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Yesterday's Lunch and Consultation</p>
<p>Directors Zhang and Yu held a banquet at the Banking Club on Hong Kong Road at 12:00 noon yesterday to further discuss the matter with the authorities of various banks in order to promote the early establishment of public bond mortgage loans, as the province needs a considerable amount of money to build roads. More than a dozen people attended, including Bei Songsun and Chen Muhao of China Bank, Tang Shoumin and Zhang Peishen of Communications Bank, Lu Qin of Jin, Chen Guangfu of Shanghai Bank, Wu Yunqi of Jincheng Bank, Ye Fuxiao of Dalu Bank, and Mei Zhezhi of Nongshang Bank. During the banquet, Zhang and Yu reported successively on the use of public bond mortgages and the recent progress of the three road projects, and asked the banking community to assist so that the roads could be completed on schedule to benefit the military's bandit suppression efforts. After the report, they exchanged views with each other. As a result, it was decided that the Central, China, and Communications Banks would first lend 1 million yuan, and negotiations would continue with various banks for the remaining amount. The banquet ended happily at 1:30.</p>
<p>Three Banks to Lend 1 Million First</p>
<p>After lunch, Finance Director Zhang Kailian, Construction Director Yu Jizhuan, Deputy Manager Chen Muhao of the Bank of China, Deputy Manager Zhang Peishen of the Bank of Communications, and four others continued to consult in a separate room at the club. The meeting ended at 2:40. After the meeting, Yu Jizhuan told the Xin Xin News Agency reporter that the Hunan provincial government needed money for road construction, and it has now been decided to mortgage 1.666 million yuan of Hunan provincial public bonds at a 60% discount to the Central, China, and Communications Banks to borrow 1 million yuan, which has been completely agreed upon. The interest rate is 8%, repayable in two years, and the payment is made in three installments. The amount allocated to the three banks is more for China Bank, followed by Central and Communications Banks. The contract is scheduled to be signed at the Central Bank tomorrow afternoon (i.e., this afternoon).</p>
<p>Negotiations to Continue for the Remainder</p>
<p>Yu also said that the Hunan provincial government decided to have the Central, China, and Communications Banks lend 1 million yuan first for the sake of meeting current urgent needs, but according to the scheduled amount, there is still a shortage of 1 million yuan. It has now been decided to continue negotiations with Shanghai, Jincheng, Dalu, Nonggong, Zhejiang Industrial, and Juxingcheng, and other six banks for mortgages. The authorities of various banks are enthusiastic to assist and have promised to do their best to help. It is expected that they can be officially agreed upon in the near future. At that time, I and Director Zhang plan to return to Hunan to report.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Pays Attention to Vacant House Tax</h3>
<p>Reply to the United Federation of City</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the United Federation of Citizens in the First Special District of this city believes that the city's economy is becoming more and more depressed due to the impact of the global economic downturn and rural bankruptcy. Prices are falling, but only the rent remains the same. Although the Rent Reduction Committee has called for and campaigned for rent reduction, most landlords have failed to implement rent reduction for their own benefit. Some owners who voluntarily reduce rent to win social sympathy are all in remote areas. In order to revive the market and reduce the burden on citizens, the Federation has specially requested the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession to collect vacant house tax to alert the owners to reduce rent and rent out, benefiting both parties. Yesterday, Zhong Si, the Director General of the Public Concession of the Public Concession, replied to the Federation, saying, "I have received your letter of March 14, and I understand. I have paid attention to the collection of vacant house tax. I am writing to reply accordingly."</p>
<h3>Yesterday: Shanghai Local Commemoration</h3>

Party and government organs in the city all hung flags in celebration. Except for primary and secondary schools, which were ordered to suspend classes for one day, all other departments operated as usual, and no ceremonies were held. Military and police authorities were also ordered to step up defense to maintain public order.</p>
<h3>Leader of the New Life Movement Inspection Group Gave Instructions and Speeches Yesterday</h3>
<p>Leaving Shanghai for Hangzhou This Afternoon</p>
<p>National News Agency reports that the New Life Movement Promotion Association Inspection Group, consisting of Xu Qingyu, Zhang Yuchong, Yu Zhongqi, and Lin Xueyan, continued to inspect the New Life Movement in the city yesterday. They departed in groups to inspect various trade associations and labor unions. Leader Xu Qingyu gave a speech at Guanghua University in the morning, attended banquets hosted by the two railway bureaus at noon, and then gave instructions to the New Life Movement Promotion Associations of the two railway bureaus at 1:00 PM. At 4:00 PM, he summoned the heads and deputy heads of the branches and the group leaders of the Youth Service Corps of the New Life Movement Promotion Association of the city at the People's Education Center for instructions. Today they will continue the inspection and leave Shanghai for Hangzhou at 6:50 PM this afternoon to inspect the New Life Movement in Zhejiang Province. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Speech at Guanghua University: Xu Qingyu, the leader of the New Life Movement Inspection Group, gave a speech at Guanghua University at 7:00 AM yesterday on "The New Life Movement and University Students." Xu said that the New Life Movement has been launched for just over a year, and respondents have reached nineteen provinces. More than seven hundred counties have established New Life Movement Promotion Associations. This movement can be said to have been effective. Our country has always been known as a land of etiquette and righteousness, but in recent years, morality has declined, and national power has weakened. The reason for this is that people are living in complacency and seeking only ease. The corruption of officials and the corruption of internal affairs have become undeniable facts. Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek, in view of this, initiated the New Life Movement. The goal of the New Life Movement is propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, so that people observe discipline and understand responsibility. Propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are the four pillars of the country. If the four pillars are not upheld, the country will perish. The rise and fall of countries at home and abroad throughout history can prove this. University students are outstanding members of the youth and the backbone of the country. They should understand the importance of the New Life Movement, practice it personally, be diligent, and not be lazy, be responsible in handling affairs, maintain order, cultivate excellent and perfect character and knowledge, and forge a healthy body, and bear the responsibility of reviving China and reviving the nation. He encouraged each other, and so on.</p>
<p>Inspection of Guilds and Labor Unions: Yesterday, Zhang Yuchong, the first group inspector of the New Life Movement Association, accompanied by Zhu Xuefan, Chairman of the Shanghai General Labor Union, went to the Postal Workers Union, the Postal Union, and the General Labor Union, then to the Dyeing Industry Union, the Fourth District Cigarette Industry Union, and visited various departments of the Huacheng Cigarette Factory, and then to the Tenth District Cotton Textile Industry Union. The second group of inspectors, Lin Xueyan and Yu Zhongqi, accompanied by Zhao Erchang, specially appointed by the Municipal Party Department, went to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Cigarette Factory Association, the Silk Industry Association, the Sugar Industry Association, the Medicinal Materials Industry Association, and the Northern Goods Industry Association. After the inspection, they attended a banquet hosted by Wu Shao, the acting director of the two railway bureaus. At 3:00 PM, the first group inspector, Zhang Yuchong, accompanied by Zhu Xuefan of the Shanghai General Labor Union, went to the Military Uniform Industry Union and the Seamen's Union. The second group of inspectors, Lin Xueyan and Yu Zhongqi, accompanied by Zhao Erchang of the Municipal Party Department, went to the Western Pigments Industry Association, the Frozen Fish Industry Association, the Bean and Rice Industry Association, the Shipping Industry Association, and the Glass Industry Association for inspection. It was not completed until about 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>Xu's Instructions at the North Station: At 2:00 PM yesterday, Xu summoned all the cadres of the New Life Movement Promotion Associations of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways at the North Station Road Bureau Building, instructing the road bureau employees on the relationship with the New Life Movement. Xu said that in recent years, through the reorganization of the persons in charge, the two railway bureaus have made great progress compared to a few years ago. The road bureau employees themselves are already practitioners of the New Life Movement. However, we cannot be complacent because of this. We should still lead by example and extend it to others so that the New Life Movement can make greater progress. I think that the employees of the two railway bureaus still need to pay attention to three points, that is, how to make personal life militarized, productive, and artistic. To make life militarized, the first thing to pay attention to is simplicity and plainness. Everything should be disciplined and possess military common sense. To make life productive, the first thing to do is to be economical. The way to make life artistic is not to get bad habits, so that the body and spirit are healthy and happy. In addition, whether in dealing with the world or in establishing oneself, it is especially important to pay attention to having four things: strong feelings. The two railway bureaus are located in the affluent areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The daily number of passengers is up to 70,000. Even if we count 50,000 people per day, the annual number is at least 15 million. If the employees of the two railway bureaus can persuade passengers with the meaning of the New Life Movement, so that everyone understands the importance of the New Life Movement and practices it, then the effectiveness can be imagined. I still have a hope that Director Ma can train the road police so that everyone understands the importance of the New Life Movement and promotes it.</p>
<p>Service Group Listens to Instructions: At 4:00 PM, the New Life Movement Association summoned the heads and deputy heads of the branches and the group leaders of the Youth Service Corps of the New Life Movement in the city at the People's Education Center to listen to instructions from Mr. Xu Qingyu, the leader of the inspection group. The venue was a lecture hall. A white cloth banner with the words "Welcome the Inspection Group of the New Life Movement General Association to Come to Give Instructions" was hung at the entrance. In the center of the auditorium were the images of the Party, the country, and the Founder. Order slogans were placed on both sides, and the four walls were covered with slogans. Wu Xingya and Lu Jingshi served as chairmen, Du Mengsen and Zhu Airen as recorders, Zhang Hanyun as master of ceremonies, Hu Tianseng as affairs, Yang Dean, Shen Liangzhong, Zhu Jiarang, and Gu Ruofeng as executors. More than 400 people attended, including the heads of the branches Bao Henian, Wang Deyan, Ling Xianwen, Shen Yu, Shen Ding, Feng Xiancheng, Chen Baotai, Wang Chengmeng, Mei Hongquan, Wang Yonggong, Chen Zhongfu, and the deputy heads and group leaders of the branches.</p>
<p>Chairman Reports the Opening of the Meeting: After performing the rituals, the chairman first reported, saying that today, the heads of the branches and the group leaders of the Youth Service Corps are here to listen to the instructions from the leader of the General Association Inspection Group. This is also the first time that the group has concentrated since its establishment. It is a great honor to have Mr. Xu, the leader of the inspection group, give us instructions. Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek (the entire audience stood up to pay tribute) advocated the New Life Movement, which is indeed the only way to revive the nation. The decadence, laziness, listlessness, romance, and other bad habits of the Chinese people have been deeply rooted. If we want to revitalize the country, I am afraid it is impossible. Now we must eliminate bad habits and create a new atmosphere, so we must work hard to implement the New Life Movement. The city was ordered to form the Youth Service Corps, which hopes that the youth will take on the role of pioneers in implementing the New Life Movement and promoting the New Life Movement. Although it has not been established for a long time, some old habits have been slightly changed. However, we dare not be complacent. We hope that you will continue to work hard and always maintain the spirit of service. Whether the New Life Movement will be fully implemented in the future, whether the nation will be revived, and whether the country will be strong, depends on the results of your efforts.</p>
<p>Xu's Main Points of Instruction: Next, Xu Qingyu gave instructions, saying that since I have only been in Shanghai for five days, I have not had time to meet with you everywhere. I am very happy to be able to gather here. Mr. Lu has spoken in detail about the mission of the New Life Movement, so I don't need to talk too much about it. But what I want to ask you to pay attention to is that service is in the spirit, and you must have interest. Before starting out, you must first recognize the mission of service. If you are perfunctory and follow the old ways, you will definitely fail in the future. The Chinese only know how to be selfish and gain for themselves, and do not understand what the nation and the country are. That's why we have reached the current situation. If we don't talk about morality and remain depressed, the future will be too dangerous. Therefore, we only have to work hard to implement the New Life Movement, which is the only way to save the country. And every young person must have self-confidence and use the motto "If I am here, China will not perish" as a motto. The phenomenon of inspecting various places this time is very good. Social customs have changed considerably. Corrupt officials and corrupt officials are rarely seen. The army is also disciplined. Education has also made progress. Young people everywhere respect the Founder (the entire audience stood up to pay tribute) and Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek (the entire audience stood up to pay tribute). The situation in Shanghai is even better. The youth are more lively and lovely. Everything is more advanced than two or three years ago. On behalf of our leader Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek (the entire audience stood up to pay tribute), I offer you a few opinions. I hope you will work hard.</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning: Talking about International Loans, Specific Methods Are Being Planned; Issuing Financial Bonds is to Relieve Industry and Commerce</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi arrived in Shanghai by train from Nanjing at 7:20 yesterday morning. After returning to his residence, he met with bankers Chen Guangfu and others at his residence to discuss ways to relieve Shanghai's industry and commerce. At 4:00 PM, he met with Fu Rulin, a member of the National Water Conservancy Commission, at the Central Bank to discuss the aftermath of the breach of Guantai. Then he met with reporters from various newspapers. First, the reporter asked about the international loan. According to Minister Kong, countries are very concerned about the emergency in the Far East financial market. Our government has received a note from the British government, inquiring about our country's opinions and methods for relieving finance, and is willing to consult with relevant friendly countries to provide effective assistance. Our government has expressed its approval. Chancellor Judd of the Central Bank in Nanjing had visited him. As for the specific methods, they are being planned. When asked about the issuance of the 24th year financial bonds, he said that the Ministry of Finance, in view of the decline in the market and the fact that many industries and businesses are asking banks for loans, the Ministry of Finance presented a request to the Central Government to issue bonds in order to increase the strength of the Central, China, and Transportation banks, and to obtain funds for use. Regarding the relief of various industries and businesses, Kong said that a meeting of leaders from all walks of life was previously convened, and it was decided that each industry should negotiate methods. Now each industry is holding meetings to negotiate. As for the methods submitted by the Chamber of Commerce, they have been submitted to the Ministry, and should have been approved and handed over to the Bank of China for proper discussion and reply. If it is necessary to hold another meeting, it can be convened at any time.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Wu's Reply and Thanks: Then Wu Xingya delivered a reply, saying that today, the few points that Director Xu gave us on behalf of Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek (the entire audience stood up to pay tribute) are like personally receiving Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek (the entire audience stood up to pay tribute) to give instructions. Not only will we never forget them, not only will we always follow them, but we should also accept them with the most solemn salute. Director Xu said that service must be interesting. We must go from simple to complex, from shallow to deep, and gradually make progress and work hard. Director Xu elaborated in detail, based on the Founder's (the entire audience stood up to pay tribute) ambition to do great things, not to be a high official. At present, the New Life Movement is a major event for the revival of the nation. All members should take on this important responsibility, work hard, persevere, and sincerely influence the general public. I hope that the heads of each branch and the group leaders will convey this to all the members and work hard, so as not to fail the instructions of Director Xu today, and should thank Director Xu (the entire audience bowed). Finally, all the attendees raised their hands in front of the Founder's portrait and swore to work hard to implement the New Life Movement, and then shouted slogans and dispersed.</p>
<p>Various Parties Hosted Banquets Yesterday: At noon yesterday, Wu Shaozeng, the acting director of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus, specially hosted a banquet at the North Station Building of the two railway bureaus to entertain the four commissioners, accompanied by Ma Ziping, the chief of the police station of the two railway bureaus, and more than 20 other senior officials of the two railway bureaus. The guests and hosts exchanged toasts until about 1:00 PM, when the guests and hosts dispersed. At 7:00 PM in the evening, university professors Shen Tilan, Li Gongpu, Zhang Yifan, and others also hosted a banquet at McLaren Middle School to entertain Xu Qingyu and other four commissioners. During the banquet, they also discussed education reform in detail until 9:00 PM, when the banquet ended.</p>
<p>Today's Municipal Government Tea Party: Today, the four commissioners will continue their inspection and decided to divide into two groups. The first group consists of Zhang Yuchong, Lin Xueyan, and Yu Zhongqi, accompanied by Gu Ruofeng and Yang Dean, cadres of the Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association, to inspect the Pudong Fifth District Party Department and Yangjing Middle School. The second group consists of Xu Qingyu, the leader of the inspection group, accompanied by Lu Jingshi, a cadre of the New Life Movement Promotion Association, to inspect Zhenru, Jinan University, and the First Directly Subordinate Branch, and give a speech at Jinan University. At 2:00 PM, a tea party will be held in the auditorium of the Municipal Government to summon the principals and deans of discipline of major and secondary schools, as well as the heads of government agencies and the leaders of various people's organizations. The Shanghai New Life Movement Association has issued the following notice: "Dear Sir/Madam, the New Life Movement General Association Inspection Group has come to Shanghai to give instructions on the direction of the New Life Movement. It has been decided to summon the principals and deans of discipline of various universities and secondary schools, as well as the heads of government agencies and the leaders of various people's organizations, to hold a tea party at the Municipal Government at 2:00 PM on the 22nd of this month. We hope that you will take the time to attend. Sincerely,"</p>
<p>Leaving for Hangzhou Tonight for Inspection: The New Life Movement General Association Inspection Commissioner has inspected Shanghai for five days. After completing the inspection today, it has been decided to take a special train to Hangzhou at 6:50 PM this afternoon. According to Xu, who spoke to a reporter from the National News Agency, from tomorrow onwards, he will inspect the New Life Movement in Hangzhou and stay in Hangzhou for three days. He will also inspect the New Life Movement situation on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. After completing the inspection in Hangzhou, he will go to Fujian to inspect the New Life Movement. He plans to go to Fuzhou first and stay there for three days, and then stay in Xiamen for one day before returning to Jiangxi to report back. Xu must return to the Wuchang Camp to work after completing the inspection due to the telegram from the Wuchang Camp. Xu also said that he inspected the four provinces of Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian this time. Last year, I went to Hunan for inspection, and this autumn I will go to various provinces to continue inspecting the New Life Movement.</p>
<h3>The Public Works Department Sends Police to Protect the Soviet Russian Consulate to Prevent White Russian Demonstrations</h3>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reports that when the Russian ship "Northern" arrived in Shanghai last time, a medical officer had escaped from the ship, and its engineer, Davydov, 24, also went ashore and did not return. Later, he went to the Soviet Russian Consulate once. At the end of the year, he suddenly disappeared. The White Russian expatriates in this port widely rumored that Davydov was being detained in the Soviet Russian Consulate and that his life was in danger. Some people also said that they had seen Davydov in ragged clothes standing in front of the window, looking haggard, through a telescope from a house opposite the Soviet Russian Consulate. Now the "Northern" has sailed to Songkou again, and the White Russian expatriates are afraid that Davydov will be secretly transported back to the country. Therefore, some people are wandering in front of the consulate to spy on it. The Public Works Department's General Police Department sent many police officers to be stationed around the consulate and the Garden Bridge to prevent White Russians from demonstrating in front of the consulate. Those who went to the consulate to inquire were told that the consul general, deputy consul, and other personnel were not in the consulate, so no one was responsible for answering.</p>
<h3>Luo Qinghua Advocates Commercial Acceptance Bills, Sends Letters to the Cotton Cloth and Dyeing Industries to Adopt Them Consistently</h3>
<p>"New Voice" reports that since the Silk Industry Association created commercial acceptance bills, it has aroused deep attention from all walks of life. Economists Yang Yinpu, Zhang Naiqi, and Zhang Xiaomei have all written articles in favor of it. The Bankers Association has set up a subcommittee to discuss implementation methods. The Sino-British Bank has also agreed to discount bills. The members' congress of the Electrical Machinery Silk Industry Association resolved to proceed in the same way as the silk industry. Luo Qinghua, the supervisory committee member of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the chairman of the Silk Industry Association, has been particularly active in promoting this matter. Yesterday, he sent letters to the cotton cloth industry leader Ke Ganchen and the dyeing industry leader Zhu Wenqi, asking them to adopt this type of bill consistently to remedy the defects of currency contraction. The original letter is recorded below: "Since the continuous outflow of silver from Shanghai since last year, the financial turnover has suddenly felt difficult, and the market panic has become increasingly profound. It has become an undeniable fact that all parties are running around and shouting for help. Examining our country's commercial trade, most of it relies on accounts receivable. For the sake of turnover, industry and commerce have always relied on the credit loans of money shops for support, and the loans obtained are then sold to customers on credit. As a result, what the silver money shops get are the accounts receivable of the industrial and commercial sectors, and what the industrial and commercial sectors get are the accounts receivable of customers. This type of debt cannot be transferred or circulated. As a result, once there is a shortage of funds in the market, they become deadlocked with each other. Most of the panic this time was caused by the outflow of silver, but tracing back to the long-term cause, it cannot be said that it was caused by the imperfect account receivable system. I believe that industry and commerce should have a sense of self-awareness and self-rescue at this time of difficulty. In the past, the Chamber of Commerce and leaders of various industries have met and talked about the fact that accounts receivable make funds lose their flexibility and business is hindered, and they have suffered deeply from this type of account receivable system. Over the years, I have been planning methods for rectification and reform, but because all parties are comfortable with the old ways, there are many obstacles and it is difficult to implement them. As a result of the financial turmoil in the city last winter, I knew that the market would be even more desolate this spring, and the financial industry would mainly tighten loans. After repeated discussions with my colleagues in the industry, I believe that the only way to remedy the currency contraction today and lay the foundation for the future revival of industry and commerce is to create commercial acceptance bills. The reason for this is that this type of bill has been practiced in various countries for a long time, and both buyers and sellers feel it is convenient. The seller has a definite date for receiving the money for the goods, and can also hold it to the silver money shop to discount it. In this way, the currency is increased invisibly, the turnover is flexible, and the business can gradually develop. The buyer pays on time, so there is no lack of preparation. Therefore, since this case was passed by the members' representative congress of the Silk Industry Association, and a letter was sent to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to forward it to various industries for consistent promotion, economic experts such as Zhang Naiqi, Yang Yinpu, and Zhang Xiaomei have all written articles in favor of it, believing that it is worthy of promotion. Qinghua has visited many advanced figures in the financial industry, who also said that this is an urgent plan for today. Recently, the Bankers Association has set up a special committee to discuss discount promotion methods, and the central government has also replied to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce that it will agree to re-discount it. Today, industry and commerce are calling for relief and running around to tell each other that the only thing they say is that there are not enough chips and the turnover is not flexible. If this type of bill can be used universally, and accounts receivable can be turned into bill receivables, then the chips that are increased will be more than 10,000 times. If the silver money shops agree to discount them, but industry and commerce are afraid of reform, stick to the old ways, and procrastinate and delay, then how will they explain themselves? Therefore, the public association and the electrical machinery silk weaving factory industry have decided to consistently use this type of commercial acceptance bill and eliminate the receipt system from April 1, in connection with cotton cloth and other related businesses, which are like lips and teeth. I also hope that Mr. will lead his colleagues, have a vision, and have a plan regarding the use of commercial acceptance. He will definitely be happy to agree. I have presented the experience of creating and attaching a copy of the origin, and I have written a letter asking you to submit it to your association for discussion and implementation, so that we can consistently adopt it, accelerate the circulation, and achieve greater results, which will benefit the country and save the people, and is not shallow.</p>
<h3>The Cooperation of Promoting Domestic Sugar Has Been Effective; the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and Others Have Offered Encouraging Words; the Company is Scheduled to Officially Open on the 24th</h3>
<p>"New Voice" reports that the Shanghai Sugar Industry Association, in order to promote domestic sugar, has united its member sugar companies and raised 300,000 yuan to organize a sugar industry cooperative limited company. It has submitted an application to the competent authorities for registration in accordance with the Company Law, and undertakes the sale of Guangdong's machine-made sugar. The method of bidding is adopted, which is very fair. After hard work, it has been quite effective. The more than 30,000 bags of Guangdong sugar that have arrived in Shanghai have been sold out. The company is scheduled to hold an opening ceremony on the 24th, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and others have encouraged it. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Encouragement from the Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce gave words of encouragement for the company's opening, saying that sugar is a necessary food for people's livelihood. Since Taiwan was ceded, the sugarcane production in the inland provinces has become even smaller, and foreign goods have been oversupplied. Sugar has become one of the biggest sources of loss. Recently, Guangdong Province has improved sugarcane varieties and established factories for refining, which will revive the sugar industry and benefit people's livelihood. The Shanghai Sugar Industry Association, all of its members, aware of the importance of promoting domestic sugar, upholding the spirit of mutual assistance between production and sales, and gathering huge amounts of capital to organize a sugar industry cooperative company, are doing their best to promote sales, and can be regarded as those who promote domestic goods and practice what they preach. It is truly a self-awareness of the business community. The long-standing bad habits in our country's business community have been that each person operates for his own private interests and is ignorant of the country's ties, just like the ancients said, "Winning does not give way to each other, and losing does not save each other." As a result, once a foreigner competes, it is like soup pouring into a crucible. Since your company takes cooperation as its symbol, it should pay attention to the meaning of the name, develop mutual assistance and cooperation, and get rid of bad habits. In addition to recommending domestic sugar, it will also be a new atmosphere for the business community. The saying goes, "Praise does not forget the rules." At the beginning of your company's development, I dare to raise this meaning to encourage each other. Sincerely given by the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Words of Encouragement from the Industry Association</p>
<p>The Sugar Industry Association congratulated the company's opening, saying that our country's sugar-making industry began in the Tang Dynasty, and production became more prosperous by the Ming and Qing Dynasties. More than 60 years ago, not only was it self-sufficient, but it could also export to foreign countries. In modern times, science has prospered, and the sugar of all countries is machine-made. Domestic sugar, on the other hand, sticks to the old methods and does not know how to improve, which has led to the invasion of foreign sugar and filled the market. A few years ago, domestic sugar was almost eliminated, and the amount of loss was as high as 10,000 every year. The money of a country is like the marrow of a person's body. If it often flows out, how can it survive? Therefore, all citizens should rise up to rescue and share the responsibility of blocking the loss. In 1935, the Guangdong Provincial State-run Machine-made Sugarcane Sugar Factory was established, and its products are superior to foreign sugar. They are responsible for production, and we are responsible for sales. They are trying to revive domestic sugar in order to block the loss. Shanghai is an area where foreign sugar is rampant. In order to sell this budding machine-made domestic sugar, it is necessary to make unremitting efforts. Our industry upholds this responsibility and unites to establish a sugar industry cooperative company as a group to promote domestic sugar. At the beginning of the organization, all colleagues graduated together and realized the great righteousness, overcoming difficulties to succeed. We share the difficulties of co-creating and understand the magnitude of the mission we bear. We must sincerely help each other, and use the strength of the group. Those who are in charge should do their best to follow, and those who share their success should especially cooperate to help, so that the people will be united, the name will be true, and the benefit of the country will be good. You can give me thicker encouragement to me. Shanghai City Sugar Industry Association.</p>

<h3>Solicitation for Aviation Patriotic Donations; Yesterday's News: Zou Shanbao's Entire Family Joins</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Headquarters of the China Aviation Association Solicitation Team has sent letters to each team leader, additionally hiring deputy leaders and team members to take on duties. In recent days, the office has received letters from various teams requesting additional hiring, showing great enthusiasm. All have been hired separately. It is reported that yesterday, Team Leaders Tang Haian of Teams 3 and 4 requested the additional hiring of Huang Chuwei as deputy team leader, and Guan Yuting, Zhao Zuofu, Zhang Hancun, Chen Weiqing, and ten others as team members. Team Leaders Zhang Zhi of Teams 3, 4, and 5 requested the hiring of Zhang Shewo, Han Changming, You Zhi, and Shen Zongyong as deputy team leaders, and Cheng Zongjin and Hu Zhigang as team members.

<p>The Shanghai Professional Guild has sent a letter to the headquarters office requesting to join as a group member.</p>
<p>Team Leader Zou Shanbao of Team 256, the owner of a fire-resistant military uniform factory, is very enthusiastic about the solicitation work.

According to a report from the headquarters of the team, recently someone has been counterfeiting the China Aviation Association solicitation badges and selling them for one or two jiao each. After receiving the report, the headquarters sent a letter to the Municipal Public Security Bureau stating that the solicitation badges made by the office were originally issued to members to wear for identification. Unexpectedly, some traitors dared to privately manufacture and sell them, which is illegal.

<h3>Where People Are</h3>
<p>Tang Youren, Liu Ruiheng, Chu Minyi, and Yu Youren left Beijing on the night train yesterday and arrived in Shanghai this morning.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Telephone Company Plans New Billing Method Again; Tiered Increase Unfavorable to Merchants; All Industries Continue to Oppose Resolutely</h3>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, after the Shanghai Telephone Company applied to the two Municipal Councils to increase telephone charges, it has been resolutely opposed by Chinese and foreign people. The Municipal Council has not yet approved it. The company has changed its plan and applied again for implementation. This time, the new telephone rate adopts a usage-based system, which is slightly different from the previous rate requested. The details are as follows: (1) The minimum usage per month is 100 calls, with a charge of 10 yuan. (2) For 101 to 200 calls, each call costs an additional 5 fen. (3) For 201 to 300 calls, each call costs an additional 4 fen. (4) For over 300 calls, each call costs an additional 3 fen. According to this method, 1,000 calls per month would cost a total of 45 or 46 yuan, and over 130 yuan for three months. Therefore, the company has changed the previous method of collecting fees once every three months to collecting fees monthly. However, this method is even more unfavorable to merchants than the previously announced rate. Therefore, all industries are currently opposing it.</p>

<h3>Roads Slippery; Fire Truck Overturns; All Injured Sent to Guangci Hospital</h3>
<p>Hongtaixiang South Goods Store, located at No. 255 Zhaozhou Road, Xilin Road, West Gate, Nanshi, is opened by Zhu Ruiqing from Jiading. It has been operating for three years. At 2:30 AM yesterday, the store suddenly caught fire. The nearby police officer discovered it and immediately reported it to the Fire Brigade by telephone. The Fire Brigade immediately sent a fire truck to extinguish the fire. Nearby stores were awakened from their sleep and scattered in all directions, causing extreme chaos. The fire was completely extinguished around 4 AM. However, when the fire alarm was sounded, it happened to face the Municipal Council building at No. 117 Lanweiai Road in the French Concession. Therefore, the French Concession Fire Brigade also drove to assist. Unexpectedly, the No. 7 fire truck of the Baojian Road Fire Brigade, led by Frenchman Pelan Sitaro and nine firefighters, driven by driver Li Dexing, drove straight east. Unfortunately, it was raining heavily at the time, and the road was extremely slippery. Therefore, the truck lost its balance. When it reached the corner of Jin Shenfu Road and Lafayette Road, the driver accidentally turned the steering wheel, and the front of the truck rushed straight onto the sidewalk on the right, breaking two sections of a large tree on the roadside. The truck was bounced back by the tree, and the body of the truck overturned, also knocking down the second, larger tree. As a result, all the people on the truck fell under the truck. Driver Li Dexing bore the brunt and was the most seriously injured. The firefighters Yuan Changhai, Sun Jiyi, and Xie Youfu were also seriously injured. Frenchman Pelan Sitaro's eyes were scratched by broken glass from the front of the truck. Shao Aqiu, Liu Wanzi, Zhao Jinhai, and Xia Baogen were slightly injured. The French police heard the news and immediately called an ambulance to the scene. The injured people were carried onto the car one by one and sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. It is reported that none of the injuries are serious. The damaged No. 7 vehicle has been towed back to the Fire Brigade for repair.</p>
<h3>Chongming County Detains Dalian Steamer; For Smuggling Opium</h3>
<p>The Yongyu Company's Dalian steamer is a direct Shanghai-Chongming liner, making a round trip every day, coming to Shanghai from Chongming in the morning and returning to Chongming from Shanghai in the afternoon. In January of this year, Da Shu You arrived in Chongming from Shanghai. When it arrived at the port, it was routinely inspected. At that time, the police of the County Public Security Bureau found 1,000 packages of opium smuggled from Shanghai to Chongming in the Dalian steamer's accounting room. The narcotics were confiscated. After the large quantity of smuggled opium was discovered on the Dalian steamer, the Chongming County Government investigated the case. Since the criminals were not caught on the spot, the crew members were detained for questioning, and the opium was confiscated. The county government lightly fined the shipowner and let the matter drop. Unexpectedly, two months have passed since the incident. It was considered that no more problems would arise. Unexpectedly, recently, the county government received an order from the superiors to investigate the case. The old case was brought up again, and the ship had to be investigated in order to pursue the main criminal of smuggling narcotics. On the 19th of this month, the Dalian steamer sailed from Shanghai to Chongming. After the ship docked at Nanmen Port, the County Public Security Bureau sent police officers on board to summon the ship's accountant to the county office for detention. On the morning of the 20th, the Dalian steamer planned to sail to Shanghai as usual. Before the ship was launched, the County Public Security Bureau received an order to seal and detain the ship. The Da Shu Hao was immediately guarded by police officers and detained in Chongming, not allowed to sail until the case was investigated clearly. The Yongyu Company originally had two ships, the Da Yun and the Dalian. The Da Yun had an accident and sank, leaving only the Da Shu Hao. The general manager is Du Shaoshi. The Dalian steamer is only over 300 tons. After Shanghai received the telegram from Chongming, it had to temporarily suspend the Shanghai-Chongming route of the ship. General Manager Du Shaoshi believes that even if the crew members are suspected, it seems to have nothing to do with the ship itself. Once it is detained, it will hinder transportation. Therefore, he is already trying to request the Chongming County Government to release the ship.</p>
<h3>Taihu Civilian Boat Robbed</h3>
<p>Bandits Abduct Two Women; Boatman Shot and Wounded</p>
<p>Hao Ruyun from Chaohu has a civilian boat with a load of over 1,500 dan. His family members were also on the boat, along with a total of more than ten hired boatmen. He used to specialize in transporting porcelain from Jiangxi to Shanghai, unloading it to earn a living. Recently, the transportation of porcelain has been slow, so he changed to transporting miscellaneous grains and other goods. He recently loaded 1,500 bags of wheat purchased by a Shanghai flour mill in Jingjiang. He immediately sailed to Shanghai. Hao felt that traveling on the outer river was a long journey, so he traveled on the inland waterway to Shanghai, which could save several days of travel and arrive in Shanghai earlier to deliver the goods. When sailing to the Taihu County river area on the border of Jiangsu and Anhui, west of Changzhou, and sailing fast with the wind, five or six small boats suddenly sailed towards them. They were carrying a large group of lake bandits, who fired several shots into the sky and ordered them to stop. Hao saw this and immediately told the helmsman to turn the rudder and sail back. The bandits noticed this and fired at Hao's boat, chasing after them. However, the bandits' boats were smaller and faster, and they were eventually caught. At that time, two boatmen had already been shot and were lying on the deck. About forty or fifty bandits from the small boats, carrying guns, rushed onto the boat and asked the boatmen who the owner was. Hao was hiding in the back cabin and was pointed out by the crew. The bandits entered the cabin, dragged Hao out and beat him. Hao's wife was holding a child, and Hao's two younger sisters were also in the back cabin. When the bandits saw them, they immediately started to molest them. Two bandits who looked like bandit leaders told Hao's wife and sisters not to be afraid and to come out of the cabin quickly. Hao's wife and sisters cried and refused to come out of the cabin. The two bandit leaders ordered the bandits to drag them out, and they dragged Hao's wife and two sisters away, boarding three small boats separately and sailing west first. They searched all the cabins, robbing over 100 yuan, two suitcases, and other stolen goods, and sailed away on the small boats. After the bandits left, Hao saw that his wife and two sisters had been abducted and was very anxious. Suddenly, his wife returned to the boat on a small boat. The bandits released her because she was too old. He did not know where his two sisters had been taken. Hao had no choice but to set sail. Because the boat was damaged, he stopped in Kunshan. Yesterday, Hao came to Shanghai to report to the Shanghai Flour Mill, begging for help to rescue his two sisters.</p>

<h3>Conspiracy to Bomb Cargo Ship to Obtain Insurance Money; Case Concluded</h3>
<p>Ouyang Tai Returned to Custody; Chen Zheng Paid Original Bail; Court Ordered Sentencing on the Morning of the 27th</p>
<p>The Shunan Company's Shunan steamer sailed from Shanghai to Fujian and other places on September 13th last year. When the ship arrived in Sanduwo, Fujian, the shipowner Ouyang Tai went to the customs office there to surrender, pointing out that the company's manager Chen Youbai instructed him to destroy the ship and cargo to claim insurance money. The Lun (court) ordered that Ou and the ship be detained together. The company's chairman, Zheng Zhongwu, sued the local court and detained Chen Youbai for sending to the court. The police were also sent to the Minhou Local Court in Fujian to transfer Ou to Shanghai. Zhang Zi, the prosecutor, repeatedly interrogated Zheng Akang, Zheng Zhongwu's brother, and determined that Chen Youbai, Ouyang Tai, and Zheng Akang were endangering public safety and should be prosecuted. Details have been reported in previous newspapers. The details of the prosecution and the opening of the trial are recorded below. The criminal facts are briefly stated as follows: Chen Youbai is the manager of the Shunan Steamer Company, and Ouyang Tai is the shipowner. On that day, the ship sailed from Shanghai with over 300 tons of goods, a total of 13,467 pieces, to Xinghua. Chen Youbai planned to sail the ship to the shallow waters outside Xinghua and set it on fire. In advance, he falsely reported to the customs that there were over 700 tons of goods, a total of 29,722 pieces, secretly insured it, and planned to claim compensation. On the evening of the 12th of the same month, he invited Ouyang Tai to the Yangzi Hotel, and after discussion, he gave him three bottles of igniters and a forged insurance policy from the Tianxiang Company in Beihai for 4,800 yuan as a reward. He also instructed Zheng Akang, the brother of the company's chairman, Zheng Zhongwu, to act accordingly. When the ship arrived in Xinghua, Ouyang Tai was afraid of harming the lives of the passengers and could not bear to implement the plan. He announced it to the public and sailed to the Sanduwo Customs Office to surrender. He planned to send a telegram to the company but was stopped by Zheng Atai. After the incident, Zheng Zhongwu filed a complaint. The reasons for the prosecution and the legal provisions violated: Although Chen Youbai denied the above facts, Ouyang Tai confessed how Chen Youbai came up with the idea, how he instructed him to discuss it at the Yangzi Hotel, and how he gave him three bottles of igniters and a 4,800 yuan insurance policy as a reward, and instructed him to set the fire outside Xinghua. He clearly confessed everything. Chen Youbai also admitted that he falsely reported over 700 tons of customs goods. According to the letter from the Jianghai Customs Supervisory Office, the Tianxiang Company insurance policy for 4,800 yuan was also denied by Mao Yifa, an employee of the Tianxiang Company. There is no doubt that Chen Youbai secretly forged it. Zheng Akang knew the situation and participated in the preparation. According to the unanimous confessions of the ship's crew members Lin Senfan, Lin Hongchou, Wang Juxing, and Sheng Fuchen in the First Brigade of the Fujian Provincial Water Police, Zheng Akang fled as soon as he arrived in Fujian, which shows that he was guilty. Therefore, Chen Youbai, Ouyang Tai, and Zheng Akang are suspected of committing the crime in Item 4 of Article 187 of the Criminal Law. The plaintiff, Zheng Zhongwu, hired lawyer Lu Dingming and requested a civil lawsuit, requesting that the defendants Chen Youbai and Ouyang Tai jointly compensate the Shunan Steamer Company for 55,000 yuan. Liu Enrong, the criminal court judge, opened the trial several times without a conclusion. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu opened the third court again for a continued trial. On the plaintiff's side, the private prosecutor's agent, lawyer Lu Dingming, appeared in court. The defendants also hired lawyers Xue Jiaqi and Zhuang Dingxun to appear in court to defend them. After the judge took the seat, he ordered the detained Ouyang Tai and summoned Chen Youbai, Zheng Akang, and others to the case for questioning one by one. The judge concluded that the case was clear and invited Prosecutor Zhang Zui to the court to present his opinions. The lawyers on each side began their debate for a long time. The judge deemed the trial concluded and scheduled the sentencing for 10:00 AM on the 27th of this month. Ouyang Tai was returned to custody. Chen Youbai and Zheng Akang were still released on their original bail.</p>
<h3>Robbery at Chongrang Li, Fuzhou Road; Jiachang and Tongshun Companies Lose Thousands of Gold</h3>
<p>At around 5:45 PM yesterday, four or five robbers suddenly arrived at Jiachang Silk Store and Tongshun Cotton Cloth Store at No. 8 Chongrang Li, Fuzhou Road. Three of the robbers, all dressed in long robes, were armed with pistols. They broke into the stores and guarded all the shop assistants and employees, forbidding them from making any noise. The remaining robbers were stationed at the door and in the alley to keep watch. At that time, the shop assistants, seeing that the robbers were armed with weapons, were all terrified and unable to resist, allowing the robbers to do whatever they wanted. They were forced to hand over the keys to the silver cabinets. As a result, the important silver cabinets of both stores were opened, and the robbers were able to search and loot as they pleased. After about half an hour, they finally escaped after plundering. When the shop assistants regained their composure and stepped out to chase, the robbers had already disappeared. The losses of the two stores were checked and amounted to over a thousand gold. They immediately reported to the Central Police Station, requesting a search.</p>

<h3>Dragon Shun Shipyard Owner Huang Youbin Accused of Abandonment</h3>
<p>Nearing Sixty Years Old, Yet Surrounded by Concubines</p>
<p>Plaintiff Was Initially a Servant, Later Taken as a Concubine</p>
<p>Huang Youbin of Ningbo, who established the Dragon Shun Shipyard in Longhua and prospered in business, accumulating vast wealth and living comfortably, despite being nearly sixty years old, his romantic nature remains undiminished.  A woman named Huang Zhou, filed a lawsuit in the local court, accusing Huang Youbin of abandonment and neglect, requesting the recovery of living expenses. Her statement alleges that in 1924, she was seduced by the defendant, Huang Youbin, and has been in such a relationship for ten years, bearing a child. At the child's one-month celebration, Huang Youbin invited relatives and friends to a banquet and named the child Huang Hu, who is now nine years old. Later, they moved to No. 3 Yunheng Lane, Yangchang Lane, outside Xiaonanmen. Initially, the relationship was harmonious, but the defendant's fondness for promiscuity led him to take four concubines after the plaintiff. In September of the year before last, he also took a woman from Suzhou named A Feng and rented a house to live with her. The defendant's heart is devoid of affection, desiring more after obtaining one thing, and becoming weary over time, discarding her like worn-out shoes, and taking new pleasure, living a sweet life, thereafter regarding the plaintiff as a thorn in his side, frequently provoking quarrels and beatings, disregarding the plaintiff's livelihood. She requests a one-time payment of 13,000 yuan for living expenses. After receiving the lawsuit, the court, yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, held a hearing presided over by Judge Yao Fuxiang. The plaintiff, Huang Zhou, testified as above. The defendant, Huang Youbin, testified that he is fifty-six years old, from Ningbo, and vehemently denied the plaintiff's allegations. The judge asked if Xu Helin mediated the matter, resulting in an agreement for you to pay her 20 yuan per month for living expenses. Huang replied that she was slandering him. The judge said that the household registration can prove the facts. Finally, the witness Hu Changfa testified that he is fifty-four years old, from Ningbo, a fruit merchant, and used to be a neighbor of the plaintiff, Huang Zhou. In the summer of 1924, Zhou was introduced by me to work as a servant in Huang's house. Later, I don't know how, Huang married her as a concubine. The judge did not believe it, and ordered the summons of Zhang Yujin, the landlord of No. 2, Wu Jia Lane, Dadongmen, to confront the case, so that the truth could be revealed. The questioning official obtained the testimony and deemed it necessary to summon the witness, ordering a continuation of the interrogation after the witness is summoned.</p>
<h3>The Main Culprit Who Killed Yang Jiaxiang, Yang Wenchang, and Others Readily Confess</h3>
<p>—The court ordered the conclusion of the debate and scheduled the verdict for the 28th—</p>
<p>Yang Jiaxiang of Haimen, who lived in a flat in the countryside of Li's residence on Julu Dian Road in the French Concession and cultivated a garden, was lured on the evening of February 5th of this year to the barren cemetery at the foot of the Caojia Lane No. 1534, Xiahfei Road, where he was fatally wounded in the head with an axe. The murderer fled, and it was not until the next morning that his fellow villager, Zhang Huojiang, discovered him while passing by and reported it to the French Concession police. Two murder axes were found next to the body, which was taken to the morgue for examination.  After examination by the Second Special District Court, it was determined that the body would be collected by the relevant authorities, and the police were ordered to arrest the murderer.  It was not until 5:00 PM on the 9th of this month that Bao Zhenglong, a detective from the French Concession police, apprehended the main culprit, Yang Wenchang (27 years old, from the same village and living in the same residence as the deceased, but not of the same clan), and the accomplice, Gui Jinhu (25 years old, from Chongming, also living in the same residence as the deceased), at the intersection of Songshan Road and Datiebang, and escorted them to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and investigation.  The details have been recorded in previous reports. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Li Changnian, accompanied by clerk Wang Baoxun, convened the fifth criminal court to continue the trial. Attorney Yuan Jiahuang represented the police department, stating the investigation process of the police department, and prosecuted the two defendants for premeditated murder under Article 284 of the Criminal Code. Yang Wenchang confessed that he and the deceased, Yang Jiaxiang, also known as A Er, lived in the same house and were always on good terms. He wanted to ask me to rob the property of Dr. Li's house on the night of December 29th, but I refused because I was timid. On the night of the 29th, he invited more than ten people to come and forced me to go with them. Because I couldn't refuse, I pretended to agree to go and secretly went to Dr. Li's house to report to the Li family and called the police. I didn't go home that night, but stayed in a small inn in Xieqiao. On the first day of the new year, I went home and heard that the Li family had been robbed the night before, and according to Gui Jinhu, Yang Jiaxiang cursed me behind my back as a "half-devil" and wanted to kill me. I thought that if he wanted to kill me, since he was a robber, I might as well kill him first. So I discussed it with Gui Jinhu. The axe was prepared by Yang Jiaxiang. On the evening of the second day, Gui first took the axe away. At 11 o'clock that night, Gui Jinhu still called Yang Jiaxiang out, walked to Caojia Lane, and killed him. I chopped him once, and he snatched the axe from my hand, causing the handle to break. Gui Jinhu helped chop him once. After the incident, I fled back to Haimen. Recently, I was arrested when I came to Shanghai from my hometown. Gui Jinhu confessed that Yang Jiaxiang said in front of me that Yang Wenchang was a "half-devil" and wanted to kill Wenchang. I advised him that he was his own friend, so he should be lenient. Jiaxiang said he must kill him. So I told Wenchang, and Wenchang wanted to strike first and asked me to help. I agreed. So on the afternoon of the second day of the new year, I took out Jiaxiang's axe and handed it to Wenchang. At 11 o'clock that night, I went to call Jiaxiang and said to him, "Someone is waiting for you outside to talk." He was playing cards and put down the cards and followed me outside. When he walked to Caojia Lane, Wenchang chopped him once first. He snatched Wenchang's axe, and I also chopped him once. I am a middleman, a friend to both sides. Yang Jiaxiang wanted to kill Yang Wenchang and also asked me to help. Yang Wenchang wanted to kill Yang Jiaxiang and also asked me to help. I was in a dilemma and had no way out, so I had to help. At this point in the court interrogation, Li Yusheng (i.e., Dr. Li) and his daughter-in-law, Li Hua, were summoned to the court. They claimed that on the night of the 29th of the old lunar month, more than ten robbers came and robbed them of nearly 40 yuan in cash and three pieces of clothing. They did not report it to the police at the time. They could not clearly identify the faces of the robbers. Then, the police department's lawyer, and the lawyers selected and appointed by the defendants debated each other. After that, the court announced the conclusion of the debate and scheduled the verdict for the 28th. The defendants were still remanded in custody, and the two murder axes were stored in the warehouse.</p>
<h3>Qian Sanduo of Huajing Township, Second District of the County, Was Kidnapped Outside</h3>
<p>At the Same Time, His Home Was Also Thoroughly Robbed</p>
<p>Qian Sanduo, 19 years old, from Ketamiao, Huajing Township, Second District of Shanghai County, came from a family of farmers and is now considered to be well-off. Sanduo's father died many years ago, and the family only has two mothers, the legal wife and a concubine. One day, around 4:00 AM, suddenly twenty to thirty violent robbers broke down the door and rushed in, holding pistols and flashlights. They spoke with a local accent. At that time, Sanduo was out and had not returned. The two mothers were awakened and immediately tied up and severely beaten. The legal wife suffered serious injuries. Then, they began to search and rob, and they seemed quite familiar with the internal situation. Three leather suitcases were robbed, all containing clothing and other silver dollars and bedding, with a total value of several thousand yuan, which were all tied up and carried away. It was already after 5:00 AM. Now the public security authorities are purchasing leads and issuing arrest warrants for this case. Unexpectedly, at the same time, Sanduo mistakenly befriended local gangsters such as Zhang, resulting in him being lured and kidnapped to a room on the sixth floor of a hotel on Avenue Edward VII in Shanghai, where he was held in confinement and deprived of his freedom. Others, such as Qiao and Yang, notified Sanduo's family and advised them to find a way to rescue him, otherwise he might suffer an accident. After repeated negotiations, the matter was finally resolved a few days ago with the purchase of his release for 500 yuan. It is rumored that this robbery and kidnapping occurred in conjunction with each other, but the family is afraid of making enemies, so they are all keeping it secret, fearing that people will know. Some say that there are other secrets involved. (Shanghai News Agency)</p>
<h3>Even After Serving His Sentence, He Still Didn't Repent, Xu Defu Resumed His Old Profession</h3>
<p>According to His Confession, He Robbed Because He Had No Other Way to Make a Living</p>
<p>The bandit Xu Defu, 33 years old this year, from Jiangbei, was arrested and sent to court in 1929 for robbery, where he was sentenced to imprisonment. After serving his sentence and being released from prison last month, Xu still did not reform, but formed a gang and made robbery his livelihood. He was arrested by the French Concession police a few days ago. According to Xu's confession, he and his accomplices, Wang Jinfu, who is still at large, robbed the property of No. 53 Lanxiang Lane, Route Beryl, and a foreign goods store on Route Min Ti Ni Yin. The police chief ordered him to be detained, and he was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court yesterday. The police lawyer, Gu Shouxi, stated the details of the case and requested an extension to further pursue the accomplices, thoroughly investigate the details of the case, and then prosecute. Judge Zhang Chaozuo questioned Xu, "Since you have already been in court, why haven't you repented and still become a robber?" Xu confessed that he really had no way to make a living. He had no capital to work as a peddler, so he had to rob. After reviewing the confession, the court decided to postpone the trial to the 26th and remanded the defendant in custody.</p>
<h3>Chen Huazhang, Owner of Sheng Shun Ji Construction Factory, Fined for Obstructing Official Duties</h3>
<p>Chen Huazhang, a local, 53 years old this year, the owner of the Sheng Shun Ji Construction Factory at No. 4 Raul Dong Road, French Concession, was sued by a lawyer of the Shanghai Bank in the Civil Court of the Second Special District Court at the end of last year for failing to settle an overdraft of more than 2,000 yuan. When Judge Ma Yishu issued a summons and sent bailiff Wang Shaozu to deliver it, Chen refused to accept the summons and insulted and threatened Wang. He also failed to appear in court on the court date. After the default judgment, on the morning of January 4th of this year at 11:00 AM, Wang Shaozu was again sent with two police officers to deliver the judgment. Chen was lying in bed and became angry when he saw Wang, throwing the judgment on the ground. The men and women in the room surrounded Wang and the police officers and tried to make things difficult for them.

<p>Li Xida, a Ningbo native residing at No. 44 Songqing Lane, Qipu Road, his wife Zhao, named Caidi, is from Yixing, 24 years old this year, has a son and a daughter. The son is six years old, and the daughter is only three years old. On January 22nd of this year, around 7:00 or 8:00 PM, she left without saying goodbye due to a minor argument. Although Li searched everywhere, her whereabouts were unknown. He had no choice but to print leaflets and distribute them, offering a reward of 50 yuan to anyone who found her. Until the 15th of this month, Li suddenly received a letter in his wife's name, instructing him to leave 65 yuan in the public reading room of the Feihong Elementary School on Peng Road that afternoon, with the secret mark "One Zero" on the wall, and then come to collect the money. After the money was collected, she would return home. Li suspected a scam, so he reported it to the Huishi Police Department and ordered detectives to go there and act accordingly. They waited all day but did not see anyone come to collect the money. On the 19th, Li received another letter with the same content, still instructing him to carry out the same method on the afternoon of the 20th. Li reported it to the Huishi Police Department again, and Chinese detective Xie Zhiguang handled it according to law. At 3:20 PM, a Cantonese man named Huang Xiaogang came to read the newspaper and soon took the money. The detective stepped forward to arrest him and took him back to the police station. When questioned about the whereabouts of Li's wife, Huang confessed that he did not know where Li's wife was. The two letters Li received were actually written by me, hoping to defraud him of 65 yuan. He was escorted to the Fifth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Judge Huang Risheng opened the court for interrogation. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian stated the previous situation and prosecuted him according to Article 363 of the Criminal Code, requesting punishment.

<p>Lu Genquan, the owner of Lu Gen Ji Construction Factory, previously hired Lawyer Jiang Chiping to sue Tan Yuan, the engineer of Hengyao Construction Company on North Suzhou Road, in the First Special District Court for defamation, etc. The reason for the lawsuit was that Lu contracted the Jin family's house on Jiangwan Zhengde Road, which caused a dispute over the water connection problem of the Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant, leading to the lawsuit. Tan also filed a counterclaim. The result of the first trial was that both parties were declared not guilty. Both parties expressed dissatisfaction with the judgment and filed an appeal to the Collegial Panel. Presiding Judge Qian Hongye had summoned them for trial once and advised them to try to settle the matter because it was a minor matter. Therefore, during this postponement, close friends intervened to mediate, and both parties, adhering to the judge's earnest advice, dispelled their misunderstandings and did not want to continue the lawsuit for a long time. Therefore, the lawyers of both parties submitted petitions yesterday to request the withdrawal of the appeal. Presiding Judge Qian approved it, so the case came to an end.</p>

However, the woman, Ge Mei, was vigilant and frantically sounded the police whistle on the upstairs window. The gang panicked and fled, and the next day, they mailed a threatening letter, demanding 5,000 yuan and instructing someone to contact them near Maojia Stone Bridge in Hongzhen, otherwise, there would be a threat to their lives. The Huishan Police Department was notified. Detective Pi Bingzhang and detective Shen Binkui of the Red Chinese Squad arrested Li Yuding on the morning of the 12th at the Yong'an Hotel, No. 4, Lane 598, Tangshan Road, and escorted him to the First Special District Court. He denied the threatening letter part. He was ordered to be detained for further investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi came to the Third Criminal Court for investigation. Lawyer Ru Baoyi of the Public Works Department stated that after checking the handwriting of the defendant during the postponement, it did not match the threatening letter and was irrelevant. When questioned, the defendant confessed that when they went to rob, Li Xiaorong was the mastermind, and the fake gun was also given by him, instructing him to go inside first to check the situation.

<h3>The Chamber of Commerce Cables the Ministry of Finance, Requesting Correction of the Stamp Duty Dispute on Return Slips</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce cabled the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing yesterday, stating, "To the esteemed Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, on the 20th of this month, according to a letter from the Shanghai Biscuit, Candy, and Canned Food Industry Association, member Yan Shirong, the manager of Xinghua Chocolate Candy Factory, came to the association with an invoice and a goods return slip from the factory, stating that after our factory completes a transaction with a customer, we instruct the deliveryman to send it, with an invoice and return slip as proof of receipt for both parties. The invoice is stamped as usual, but after reviewing the Stamp Duty Law, there seems to be no explicit provision for stamping the return slip again, so it is no longer stamped. Unexpectedly, the stamp duty inspectors recently took away dozens of pages of return slips, and they will definitely impose arbitrary fines, requesting relief, etc. Based on this, after checking, the invoice has already been stamped as usual, so there is no need to stamp the return slip again. In order to obtain a basis for this, we have specially attached a copy of the invoice and the return slip and request your association to quickly study them and provide instructions on whether the Ministry of Finance requires return slips to be stamped, so that we can forward them for compliance." Two sample slips were attached to the association. After checking the factory's invoice, it is divided into two slips, one given to the customer for storage and one given to the customer to stamp and returned to the factory for storage. Its nature belongs to a type of delivery return slip. In other words, it is a goods receipt. According to the current Provisional Regulations on Stamp Duty, only cash receipts are stamped, and there are no goods receipts that are stamped. Since the factory has stamped the main invoice, the other slip used as a return slip should not be stamped according to regulations. The inspectors may have misunderstood the law and are deliberately demanding it. It is appropriate to send the same type of slips for your Ministry to examine and approve, and to issue a general order to correct the situation, so that merchants and inspectors can follow it. It is truly for the public convenience. Sincerely, Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>

Fearing internal and external misunderstandings, and that our painstaking efforts may not be understood, we hereby follow the Baizhang Pure Rules and strictly announce this warning. I, Abbot Xingkong, am ashamed to be in charge of Longhua, but as the ancients said, 'If the monastery is not well managed, the Dharma wheel will not turn.' Those who harm the monastery or encroach upon its assets will lose their blessings, have their lifespans shortened, suffer from terrible illnesses, or encounter disasters. At the end of their lives, they will fall into the three evil paths and all evil realms. May the gods witness this and serve as a warning to those who come after."</p>

<h3>Record of the Wuxi Fellow Villagers Association Meeting</h3>
<p>The Wuxi Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai convened a general membership meeting on March 3rd and voted to elect the third session of directors and councilors. As a result, seventeen people, including Kuang Zhongmou, were elected as directors, and fifty-one people, including Ren Nongxuan, were elected as councilors. Subsequently, problems arose with this election, so a joint meeting of the old directors was specially convened yesterday to discuss the matter. Those present included Tao Renqian, Kuang Zhongmou, Sun Qiuping, Liang Xieyong, Xiao Xiaoren, Qin Gangsun, Cha Zhongkang, Rong Ruichang, You Rongbo, Shi Fuhou, Wang Yaochen, Gu Zhizhong, Jia Chunhua, Chen Shuan, Pu Zhida, Zhao Xianji, Xu Keting, Sun Zhidao, and Zhu Junsheng, among others. Kuang Zhongmou chaired the meeting, and Xiao Xiaoren took the minutes. Matters for discussion: Yao Zhongkang, Rong Ruichang, Liang Xieyong, Qin Gangsun, and Pu Zhida proposed that since non-members participated in this election, the ballots should be opened and reviewed first. If any violations are found, it would be appropriate to re-vote and re-elect. Xu Keting, Wang Yaochen, Shi Fuhou, Zhao Xianji, and Gu Zhizhong all seconded the proposal. However, Chairman Kuang believed that since Feng Xuchen and Liu Xinquan, who handled the sealing of the ballots, were not present, it was not convenient to open them, and he refused to do so. He immediately left the meeting to express his firm stance. After some persuasion, it was resolved to appoint Jia Chunhua, Xiao Xiaoren, Sun Qiuping, and Zhao Xianji to communicate with both sides and seek a compromise. However, the majority opinion was that the matter should be handled in accordance with the law, and the ballots should be reviewed first. If they are legal, the new officials should take office immediately; otherwise, a new vote should be held to ensure prudence.</p>
<h3>Calligraphy and Painting News</h3>
<p>Exhibition of Paintings by Li Zhurui Li Zhurui from Shaoxing is skilled in painting, especially landscapes. In the late Qing Dynasty, he worked in Sichuan, and later settled in Chengdu, using painting to express himself. Now over seventy years old, his achievements are rarely seen in the world. His landscapes are majestic and possess all six principles of painting. Xu Beihong once inscribed one of his paintings, saying, "The wrinkles and dots are ancient and simple, yet the sight is fresh and novel. There are no such figures in the north and south of the Yangtze River today." Huang Binhong also praised him as "proficient in all six principles, unparalleled in the contemporary era. It is a pity that he lives in seclusion in Sichuan and is therefore rarely seen by the world." Recently, because of the Red Bandit invasion of Sichuan, Li has come to Shanghai to avoid the chaos. Friends have advised him to make himself known to the world. However, Mr. Li believes that he is too old, and Shanghai is only a temporary residence. He still plans to return to Sichuan soon. Recently, the Baowenzhai Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition in Beijing opened, and friends begged him to display several of his works, such as "Scenes of Mount Emei," "Realistic Sketches of the Three Gorges," and "Kuanglu Peaks," all of which are masterpieces.

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, I have read in your newspaper today about the lawsuit filed by Ms. Lu Ping against the Tongchang Motor Company for defamation, which involves me and is inconsistent with the facts. I have checked and found that I did not receive a subpoena from the court beforehand, which is why I did not appear in court. I did not refuse to appear. Furthermore, I have been the director of the Tongchang Advertising Department for many years and have a deep relationship with the company's young owner. Last year, due to the economic downturn, my salary was high, and although the young owner did not say so explicitly, he often looked troubled. At that time, I had many other jobs, so I offered my resignation, and Chu Liangfang, a returned student, took over the position. The statement that the business has been suspended concerns my reputation. I request that you make a correction immediately. I am grateful for your assistance. Sincerely, Mao Keming. March 21st.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, I recently read in your newspaper on the 9th about the news of the establishment of the Shanghai New Anhui Fellow Villagers Association, in which my name was listed among the attendees. I am currently staying at the school and have not left my house. It is obvious that someone else fabricated this. I am writing to request that you publish a correction. Thank you for your cooperation. Wang Kaimin. March 20th.</p>

<p>Special Announcement</p>
<h3>Jin Cheng Bank's Business Report for 1934 (9)</h3>
<p>(1) The Soviet Union's Second Five-Year Plan for production places special emphasis on the electrification of industry and the collectivization of agriculture, aiming to become a country that equally values agriculture and industry. Therefore, since its implementation, both agricultural and industrial production in the country have developed rapidly. For example, the production of grains (including rye, wheat, barley, and oats) was estimated at 58.5 million pounds in 1932, but increased sharply to 75.1 million pounds in 1933, and further increased to 80.1 million pounds in 1934. In terms of industrial production in 1934, coal production was 92 million tons, an increase of 21.4% compared to 75.8 million tons in 1933, and an increase of 126% compared to the production in 1929. Petroleum production was 25.6 million tons, an increase of 19.6% compared to 21.4 million tons in 1933, and an increase of 76.6% compared to 1929. The value of machinery production increased by 22.5% compared to 1933 and more than quadrupled compared to 1929. Electricity production increased by 29.3% compared to 1933 and more than tripled compared to 1929. Pig iron production increased by 46.4% compared to 1933, steel production increased by 39.6% compared to 1933, rolled steel production increased by 43.4% compared to 1933, superphosphate fertilizer production increased by 30.8% compared to 1933, automobile production increased by 4.0% compared to 1933 and more than septupled compared to 1929, and tractor production increased by 28.11% compared to 1933. Looking at the overall index of industrial production (1929 equals 100), there has also been an increase in recent years, with the index being 130 in 1930, rising to 162 in 1932, 185 in 1933, and further rising to 239 in 1934.</p>

<h3>Odds and Ends</h3>
<p>— (Yang Yusheng)</p>
<p>"Zhi Zhui" (置喙) is a "Phrase" commonly used by Japanese diplomats. In colloquial Chinese, it is similar in meaning to "cha zui" (挿嘴), which means "to interject."</p>
<p>As a rule, you won't hear "Yes" or "No" from the mouths of diplomats! Because their phrasing is focused on being tactful. But Japanese diplomats are much more straightforward. When using the "Zhi Zhui" phrase, it is often linked to the words "Bu Rong" (不容), meaning "do not allow." This is a warning to the other party, saying "don't butt in!" It has the same meaning as the English "Shut Up," but without the same "angry" tone!</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I saw three or four hooligans beating a "bumpkin" on the street. Among the silent bystanders, someone actually came forward to defend him! The hooligans glared at him and told him to "scram!" They had an air of "no interjection allowed!"</p>
<p>This made me think about why God created humans with two ears, two eyes, two hands, and two feet, but only one mouth! Humans shouldn't be so talkative!</p>
<h3>Streamlined</h3>
<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>Curves, apart from the contours of women's beautiful bodies, have long been overlooked. Three-dimensionality is also gradually being forgotten by the general public. It is said that "streamlined" is the style of 1935.</p>
<p>Therefore, airplanes, trains, and motorcycles of 1935 are all streamlined. Naturally, this is very reasonable, because streamlined designs reduce the risk of damage in storms, and in good weather, they can reduce the resistance of air pressure and increase the speed of forward movement.</p>
<p>I realized that the buildings of this year may gradually become streamlined. The yurts in the desert, the coconut and palm leaf huts in the hot zones, and the Chinese tomb-style houses may become good models for the 1935-style buildings.</p>
<p>Naturally, this is not limited to buildings. Even furniture and utensils, this year, I think, clever designers will transform from three-dimensional to without corners, but not the multi-curved style that was popular before, to create the 1935-style streamlined designs for modern families to purchase.</p>
<p>Look, the window displays in large stores are not showing much three-dimensionality this year. Even whole bolts of silk cloth are displayed using streamlined methods to attract passersby to stop and watch.</p>
<p>In the material realm, there is streamlining. In the spiritual realm, I think, this year may also become increasingly streamlined. The three-dimensional, upright, and honest character is not popular anymore. Those who speak and act without corners that might bump into people, or corners that people can grab, can be considered streamlined, and are the non-outdated forerunners of the times.</p>
<h3>The Fragrant and Beautiful Wanli Bridge</h3>
<p>— A Rustic Old Man</p>
<p>I recently read Mr. Lu Jia's "Wanli Bridge" in this column, which said that the bridge is located in Shangcheng County, Henan, built with stone blocks, and is eighteen miles long. There are four small teahouses on the bridge for travelers to rest their feet, which shows how long the bridge is. Only small sheep-horn carts can be used for transportation on the bridge. Mr. Lu Jia did not mention any other famous scenic spots or romantic tales.</p>
<p>I remember Hu Zeng's poem to Xue Tao, the famous courtesan of the Tang Dynasty: "The lady calligrapher is by Wanli Bridge, living in seclusion beneath the loquat blossoms; How many talented men have come to woo, yet none can match the spring breeze." Xue Tao was a famous courtesan in Sichuan, and her fragrant boudoir was clearly built by Wanli Bridge. So, this Wanli Bridge is certainly not in Henan. For example, Luoyang Bridge is not in Luoyang, Henan, but in Huian, Fujian. Tianjin Bridge is not in Tianjin, Hebei, but in Luoyang, Henan. A place becomes famous because of its people. The Wanli Bridge in Sichuan is certainly more famous than the one in Henan.</p>
<p>According to research, the Wanli Bridge in Sichuan is located south of Huayang County. The Gazeteer of Famous Sites says: "The Shu envoy Fei Wei was sent to Wu, and Zhuge Liang saw him off. Wei happily said: 'The journey of ten thousand miles begins today,' hence the name." It can be seen that this Wanli Bridge was not named because of its length.</p>
<p>The thatched cottage of the Tang Dynasty poet Du Fu was west of Wanli Bridge. Du Fu's poem contains the line "A thatched cottage west of Wanli Bridge." The famous Tang Dynasty courtesan Xue Tao also lived by Wanli Bridge, hence Hu Zeng's line "The lady calligrapher is by Wanli Bridge."</p>
<h3>Flying Kites</h3>
<p>— Master of Spring Rain Tower</p>
<p>In the spring season, there is no more suitable exercise than flying kites. However, flying kites is not just a pastime for children; many adults also enjoy it. It is almost universally popular in the Jiangnan area, especially in Changzhou and Wuxi, where even more people love it.</p>
<p>Last spring, I took the Shanghai-Nanjing train from Nanjing to Suzhou. Passing through Changzhou and Wuxi, I saw through the train window, in the inky black wilderness and dark sky, kite lanterns flickering like long snakes. Isn't that an interesting thing for adults to do?</p>
<p>During the day, when we go for a walk in the countryside, we often hear a faint and melodious sound carried by the gentle spring breeze. This is clearly the sound of a zheng (stringed instrument) attached to the kite; otherwise, there would be no such sound waves in the clear sky. At this time, taking a spring outing in the countryside with a kindred spirit, stepping on the soft green grass, with the warm spring sunshine shining on us, we might as well sing a "Spring Song" to complement the intoxicating spring scenery.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I received a letter from a friend in Changzhou, inviting me to a kite flying competition. I used thatch as the frame and red silk as the skin to make a very exquisite star kite. With a thin silk thread, I will let it fly freely and surely win praise. Soon, I want to take it to the competition. But we in Si'an are also having a kite flying competition, scheduled for March 16th. Friends who love kites will certainly bring all kinds of different kites to participate, and the sky will be adorned with great beauty!</p>
<h3>Arbor Day</h3>
<h3>Small Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Jia Duocai smiled and said, "I understand what you mean even if you don't say it. It's probably that besides accompanying people to smoke and play cards, there are some other things. Then you should have earned some money, why are you so poor as to do this kind of thing?" Yang Wanhua said, "Alas! It's really my own fault. Because I accompanied people to smoke, I could smoke for free, and I became addicted without realizing it. Originally, I felt very uncomfortable, and smiling and talking to people was forced. These days are even more difficult than being beaten and scolded. By last autumn, I had developed all kinds of hidden illnesses, and my face was even uglier after being smoked by the cigarettes. Within a month, it was difficult to find someone who was willing to buy my body. For example, last time, Mr. Li introduced me to Mr. Jia, and I tried my best to please him, but Mr. Jia didn't want me. Isn't that clear proof? Today, someone opened a room next door and called me over. He didn't like me, smoked with me for a while, and left first. I thought the room fee was already paid, so I might as well sleep here for one night and wait for another opportunity. Unexpectedly, I accidentally saw your banknotes in the crack of the wall. It doesn't matter if I don't have food or cigarettes, but I have a chest pain problem that occurs every three or four days, and I can't bear it. I rented a room in the southern alley from the local people, because it saves some money, but it is too inconvenient, and I have to do everything myself. When my illness flares up, who will take care of me? I can only wait to die. Moreover, the landlords don't want to rent to me anymore. I really want to find some money to treat my illness, and it would be even better if I could find more money to escape back to Henan. When I saw the money you put on the table in the crack of the wall, it was enough for me to spend my way home. If I became a thief once and stole this money to go home and reform, wouldn't that be a good plan? I know you don't care about this little bit of money, so I took action. If it were a poor person, I wouldn't dare to touch it. However, I'm always sorry to you, sir. I'm willing to do whatever you want me to do. I only have this body left, sir!" As she spoke, she sobbed again. (163)</p>
<h3>Imperial Incense Misty Record</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Now is the time for silkworms to spin silk and build their cocoons!" One morning, the Empress Dowager thought of the spring silkworms she kept and led us to visit them again. While Her Old Majesty was talking to us eloquently, the girls raising silkworms were busy working! They are indeed very busy these days; but for the rest of the year, they can eat their fill and do nothing, sleeping in the garden. "We are different here from the outside world! Ordinary people mostly tie dry firewood into short bundles and put the silkworms that are about to spin silk on them, letting them make cocoons there; the silk obtained in this way is often not very smooth. So, we use specially made small boxes, each box containing four silkworms." The Empress Dowager pointed to the many paper boxes stacked high over there and continued to say to me: "After they go in, they will each occupy a corner and make cocoons without interfering with each other. You can come and see often if you don't believe me!"</p>
<p>I really obeyed her words and came to see them even more often. It was indeed very interesting! Whenever a silkworm is about to spin silk, it no longer eats mulberry leaves, as if it is already too full; at this time, its body is very thick and long, and it has become a transparent color. So, the girls raising silkworms gently put them into those small boxes, four in each box, covered the box and placed it flat, letting them work hard to make cocoons. After about five or six days, when the box is opened, four white or golden cocoons have been neatly formed in the four corners of the box. However, it is said that the four silkworms in a box must be of the same color. If three are white and one is yellow, the yellow one will not spin any further after completing half of its cocoon; so, they must be distinguished in advance and not mixed up. (274)</p>
<h3>Shortcut</h3>
<p>— Yu Sheng</p>
<p>In the evening, go to the bathhouse, undress, and take a bath. After bathing, dress and go home, then undress again and go to bed. Why not just have a car carry you directly to your bed after bathing!</p>
<p>In the yarn factory, cotton is ginned, spun into yarn, reeled, packaged, and sold. The weaving factory, however, unpacks the bales, applies sizing, and puts the yarn on the looms. Why not sell the reeled yarn directly to the weaving factory!</p>
<p>These are just jokes, but Chinese people really take too many detours when doing things! They are unwilling to take shortcuts, so they are always falling behind!</p>
<p>Travels</p>
<h3>Cherry Blossoms on Three Islands</h3>
<p>— Xunzi</p>
<p>The waves of the southeast wind bring news of spring. Spring is truly a season for outings. The plum blossoms of Dengwei and the peach blossoms of Longhua, one after another, smile and offer themselves for people to enjoy. Even more so, the cherry blossoms of Three Islands bloom a little later than the plum blossoms and a little earlier than the peach blossoms, making visitors linger and reluctant to leave!</p>
<p>The cherry blossom is the national flower of Japan. Whenever the season of full bloom arrives, the whole country is truly in a frenzy. Factories and schools all take holidays, and even the police wear paper cherry blossoms on their hats. On the streets, people walk as if writing calligraphy with their feet, humming songs with a humming sound in their mouths – these are the drunkards returning from viewing the cherry blossoms. Viewing flowers must involve drinking. In ancient China, there was Shan Tao, who "would not return home unless drunk." In Japan, during the cherry blossom season, temporary sake shops are set up everywhere with reed mats. The workers will exchange the money they have accumulated from a month of hard work for sake and get drunk under the cherry blossom trees. The workers in Japan understand "the art of life" better than those outside Japan.</p>
<p>In the late second month, when the "lingering cold has not yet faded," people sitting on mats still feel a bit of pain in their fingertips and have to reach out to warm them over a large pot. However, newspapers such as the Asahi Shimbun and the Mainichi Shimbun are already urging readers in a slow and gentle tone, saying that "the season of flowers is about to arrive." Because the cherry blossom is the national flower of Japan, the single word "flower" can represent cherry blossoms on Three Islands. Occasionally, when an early-blooming cherry blossom in Ueno Park puts out two or three buds on its branches before his companions can feel the "grace of spring," it causes a big stir! The photographers from the newspapers, with you carrying a camera and me carrying a tripod, rush to Ueno to photograph the buds. A little later, the morning or evening newspaper prints the photos, and people, seeing the report, run to Ueno to "find it according to the picture."</p>
<p>Besides the cherry blossoms of Ueno Park, Mount Asukayama is also a famous place for viewing cherry blossoms in Tokyo. Mount Asukayama is located outside Tokyo and can be reached by train in an instant. The mountain is not very high, about the same as Tiger Hill in Suzhou. Besides cherry blossoms, there is nothing else to play. However, the Japanese have great skill in embellishing natural scenery. They plant cherry blossoms all over the mountains and fields, so that visitors walk under the cherry blossom trees from the foot of the mountain to the top. At the end of each section of the road, there are temporary sake shops, tea shops, cafes, and restaurants covered with reed mats. Visitors not only wear colorful floral clothes to fulfill "dressing in brocade and walking in the daytime," but also have strangely dressed men and women with makeup like in old Chinese dramas, with painted faces, and some wearing masks. Everyone puts the two words "carnival" into practice.</p>

<h3>The Long-Suspended Sino-Portuguese Football Cup Will Be Revived, To Be Held After the World Cup</h3>
<p>The Sino-Portuguese football match, which has been suspended for many years, was initially sponsored with a large silver cup donated by the Portuguese Sports Association. The two teams hold three matches each year in a best-of-three system, with the annual winner determined within three years. The team that wins two years out of the three will have permanent possession of the cup. China won the first edition, but the second was never completed. Afterwards, either due to time constraints or the incomplete Portuguese team, it could not continue. There was a proposal to revive it last year, but it did not materialize due to time constraints. This year, the football association feels very relaxed, and with the Portuguese having a lot of talent and winning the World Cup final, the enthusiasm is very good. Therefore, both the Chinese and Portuguese sides are actively working to continue the event. According to a staff member of the National Sports Association, the competition will be held after the World Cup.</p>
<h3>A Chinese Innovation: Indoor Lawn Tennis at Shen Garden on Sunday Evening: Zheng Zhaojia vs. Carlson</h3>

Now that the Shanghai Basketball League has ended, the authorities are using this venue to plan indoor lawn tennis to provide practice for Xu and Zheng before they go abroad. It was set up a few days ago. Indoor lawn tennis, which requires playing under lights, is still a novelty in China. It has been agreed that Mrs. Vreede, Carlson, Zheng Zhaojia, and Jia Bude will hold a singles and doubles exhibition match on Sunday evening (the 24th) of this week for the appreciation of the people of Shanghai.

<h3>Zhang Yousan and He Bingsong Explain the Meaning of Indigenous Chinese Culture</h3>
<p>Since the publication of the Ten Professors' Declaration, it has aroused national discussion, and the enthusiasm has been advancing with the times. However, the general public's understanding of the meaning of culture and indigenous Chinese culture is quite inconsistent. At the same time, some believe that the proposition of the Ten Professors' Declaration is exactly the same as the proposition of "Chinese learning as the foundation, Western learning for practical application." Therefore, the signatories of the Ten Professors' Declaration, whenever invited to speak on cultural construction issues, make efforts to explain the definition of culture and the similarities and differences between the indigenous Chinese culture and the proposition of Chinese learning as the foundation and Western learning for practical application, hoping that the general public can also gain a practical understanding. The key points of the speeches by Zhang Yousan and He Bingsong at Guanghua University and the Chinese Vocational Education Society are excerpted below to inform those who are interested in the cultural construction movement.</p>
<p>Zhang Yousan's View on Indigenous Chinese Culture: Mr. Zhang Yi was invited to give a public lecture at Guanghua University yesterday, with the topic being "Is 'Chinese Learning as the Foundation and Western Learning for Practical Application' Correct?" He elaborated on the inadequacy of this proposition in integrating Chinese and Western cultures. Mr. Zhang's lecture mainly stated that the adoption of both Chinese and Western cultures can be divided into two types: mixture and synthesis. Chinese learning as the foundation and Western learning for practical application is only a mixture, while what is needed is synthesis. Moreover, the synthesis process must be prepared in advance and cannot be allowed to proceed arbitrarily. Specifically, it is necessary to adopt both the spirit of self-discipline in Chinese culture and the science of the West to create a new Chinese culture.</p>
<p>He Bingsong's Speech at the Vocational Education Society: The Chinese Vocational Education Society specially invited Mr. He Bingsong, a signatory of the "Ten Professors' Declaration," to give a public lecture on "Culture and the Standards for Constructing Culture." A large audience attended, filling the seats. First, Yang Weiyu, the director of the society's office, gave an introductory speech, followed by Mr. He's speech, which lasted for over an hour, elaborating in detail, moving the audience. Mr. He first stated that his speech completely represented the meaning of the ten comrades, but if there were any errors, he would take sole responsibility and hoped that everyone would correct him. Next, he stated that culture is the result of human adaptation to the environment to improve life, which contains the meanings of hard work and continuous progress. In detail, culture is the result of human beings working hard to improve their lives in the face of difficult and challenging environments. The ancients said, "Renewing daily, and again daily, striving for the utmost good," which is what it means. The reason why the ten comrades wanted to publish the "Ten Professors' Declaration" is because they felt that the inherent culture of this country, measured by modern standards, is no longer applicable, while Western culture, measured by Chinese standards, is not suitable, making our ancient civilization, like a flickering lamp, unable to discard the old or create the new, drifting in a state of transition. At the same time, they also saw that China has suffered deeply from the oppression of imperialism in the past century, making our great country suffer from internal hardship and external isolation, and the survival of the nation for more than 4,000 years is in imminent danger. It seems that it is necessary to urgently open up a new path to save the nation. Therefore, they put forward an opinion based on the duty of every citizen and asked the people of the country for guidance. The ten comrades believe that to construct an indigenous Chinese culture, we must neither stick to the old nor blindly follow, and we must first recognize the needs of China at this time and place. The most urgent needs of China now are (1) enriching the people's lives, (2) supporting the survival of society, (3) developing the people's livelihood, and (4) continuing the life of the nation. Therefore, whether it is inherent or foreign culture, we should preserve and introduce everything that meets the above needs, otherwise, we should reject it. Therefore, these four needs are the standards for us to construct an indigenous culture. Mr. He finally concluded that human progress is endless, and the ultimate goal of constructing culture is to create healthy individuals to form a healthy society. As for how to achieve this goal, due to time constraints and because it is not within the scope of the topic, it cannot be elaborated.</p>

<h3>Zhou Dingming and Others Initiate Zhou Scholarship Fundraising Association</h3>
<p>Membership Limited to Zhou Clan; Intend to Invite Zhou Clan Members from All Locations to Join</p>
<p>Zhou Lingming, a 27th-generation descendant of Song Confucian Zhou Lianxi, a native of Shaoxing, believes in Christianity, and likes public welfare. He once worked hard to restore the Zhou Lianxi Public Ancestral Hall in Hangzhou West Lake, and was highly regarded by his clan for his diligence and was elected as the accounting director, achieving excellent results. In recent years, he has served as a clerk for the China Leprosy Relief Association and Christian educational and charitable organizations in Shanghai, and has been diligent and conscientious in his work. Now, in view of the decline of the Zhou clan and the fact that many of its children are illiterate, he has resolutely invited the clan members of the Zhou Lianxi lineage to prepare for the establishment of a Zhou Scholarship Fundraising Association for impoverished children. All impoverished descendants of the Zhou clan have the right to receive scholarships when they study up to the fourth grade of elementary school, until university. However, this matter is of great importance, and it is not easy to establish. Once the number of participants reaches the statutory number, the predetermined chairman Zhou Wenyu will lead the way and submit an application to the authorities for registration.</p>

<p>Foreign Rice Settlements Quite Active, Margin Gold Drops Then Recovers</p>
<p>Market Conditions Mostly Sideways, Slight Dip of Seven Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday's gold market saw the price of gold in London plummet, though it recovered later. Initially sluggish, the market was sustained by significant buying due to active foreign rice settlements, leading to a temporary boost in subsequent trading. Silver prices rose consecutively, ultimately stabilizing. According to foreign news, overseas silver markets saw a slight decrease in Britain and remained stable in America. However, sources claimed that America raised prices by 0.125 and India by 0.0625 after the market closed. Forward silver prices saw mixed fluctuations. Exchange rates contracted. London gold prices were severely impacted by the cabinet upheaval, plummeting by one shilling eight and a half pence, shaking confidence. Some retail investors, based on reports of a proposed 100 million yuan financial bond issuance, mistakenly speculated that it implied inflation. Consequently, pre-market trading opened at 71.2 yuan, but retail investors absorbed the initial drop. Large traders repeatedly sold off, breaking the 70 yuan barrier and dropping to 68.9 yuan. The Central Bank's official exchange rate showed stable British rates but contracted American rates, with the customs gold unit plummeting 0.0025 yuan. The margin gold standard was 903 yuan. Prices initially fell in the morning, but strong support emerged, and banks bought at bargain prices, gradually pushing the price back up. Foreign rice settlements were lively, with HSBC and Mercantile Bank actively buying, tightening the domestic market and pushing prices above 70 yuan temporarily. HSBC's official exchange rate revealed stable British rates and a contraction of 0.125 in American rates, with minimal impact. The Central Bank sold shillings, and banks also sold at high prices, gradually pulling prices back within the 70 yuan range. However, the overall trend was very calm, with prices fluctuating only slightly. The foreign exchange market remained stable, but retail investors actively sold off. The market was flat in the afternoon, hovering around 70 yuan, with large traders continuing to provide support. Retail investors were exhausted, and rumors of a 0.034 anna contraction in Indian silver prices stirred up strong buying interest, causing a brief surge. However, large traders took the opportunity to sell off, pushing prices down. Despite Sassoon buying shillings, Indian silver prices rose twice consecutively by one anna, causing prices to fluctuate and eventually decline. However, buyers emerged at lower prices, leading to another period of sideways trading. The day's market remained lackluster with low trading volume. Given the crowded settlement season, the trend is expected to remain stable. Yesterday, both sides posted eight jiao for the forward rate. The following summarizes the day's market conditions.</p>
<p>Morning: Opened at 868.9 yuan, down 4.1 yuan from the previous close. Heng Yu and Ri Chang sold, dropping from 9.3 yuan to 7 yuan.

Spot market conditions were stable, and Tianjin goods were approximately 9.5 yuan higher. Shan Tianjin traders sold 420 taels to Da De Cheng and 280 taels to Qian Chang Xiang, because the market price in Tianjin was low. Forward trading was still active. Yesterday, both sides posted 8 jiao, initially with Heng Xing posting 14 strips to Fu Xing Yong. Before long, Fu Xing Yong and Qian Chang Xiang successively posted, and there was a lack of buyers at one point. Fu Tai Heng then came to post, totaling 28 strips to Qian Chang Xiang, 21 strips to Heng Yu, and 14 strips to Fu Yu Yong. However, Fu Xing Yong continued to demand more parties, and Da De Cheng then posted 42 strips, Fu An 7 strips, Wan Xing 56 strips, and Yi Feng Yong 14 strips, all of which were taken by Fu Xing Yong at 8 jiao. In the afternoon, Fu Xing Yong continued to post at the same price, totaling 70 strips to Shen Kang and 35 strips to Hui Yuan.

<h3>Overseas Exchange Rates Contract, Local Exchange Market Sees Weak British and Tight American Rates</h3>
<p>Foreign Rice Settlements Cause Banks to Actively Buy, Process Remains Tight</p>
<p>According to yesterday's foreign news, both near-term and forward rates in London contracted by 0.1875, with very strong underlying support, claiming that America would raise prices by 0.125 and India by 0.0625 after market close. New York silver prices remained unchanged. Monteray forward silver prices saw both rises and falls. London gold fell by one shilling eight and a half pence. The British exchange rate against the US contracted by 0.02625, and the US exchange rate against the British contracted by 0.0175. The British exchange rate against the French fell by 50 pounds, and the US exchange rate against the French fell by 25. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with near-term selling prices: British exchange at one shilling seven pence two five, US exchange at 38.1875 yuan, compared to the previous closing price, indicating weak British rates and tight American rates of 0.0625. The Central Bank's official exchange rate revealed stable British rates and a contraction of 0.125 in American rates, with the customs gold unit falling by 0.011 yuan. Confidence was lacking, and the opening was seemingly strong. Banks took advantage of low prices to buy and settle, which managed to maintain stability. HSBC's official exchange rate revealed stable British rates and a contraction of 0.125 in American rates, because of arbitrage in small foreign exchange transactions, there was not much impact. Later, HSBC actively bought, with the process becoming slightly tighter. However, the tightening trend was hindered by the Central Bank selling shillings. Because banks tentatively bought and sold, and Mercantile Bank persistently bought heavily, foreign rice settlements were quite active. Thereafter, the market hovered. Although Chinese merchants sold, banks were still buying. The market process was slightly tighter. Banks sold at high prices, and although Sassoon bought in the end, because Indian silver rose twice more by 0.011 anna, there was no change in the domestic market. Extended to the market close, recent selling price British exchange one shilling seven pence two five, US exchange 38.1875 yuan, compared to the previous close is a relaxation of the British rate of 0.0625, the US rate is tight 0.0625, this is also the impact of foreign exchange contraction. Chinese merchants sold US exchange by approximately 500,000 yuan. The afternoon market was ordinary. Banks like Mercantile Bank and HSBC vigorously settled, presumably because of foreign rice settlements. The following is a record of the day's transactions.</p>

Consequently, the interbank call rate remained at 6%, both in the morning and afternoon sessions, with no added interest (literally, "no added water"). Trading of discount bills occurred, with over 3.6 million yuan in morning transfers, and over 300,000 yuan in new transactions.

Transaction volume: 5,000 jiao in the morning, 4,000 jiao in the afternoon.

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>The Reason for Bond Market Instability</p>
<p>Increased Margins in the Market</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, due to the approaching settlement date, there was a trend with the potential to continue rising. However, the sudden approval by the Central Political Committee of the 100 million yuan financial bonds, initially considered to have excellent terms and short duration, would not likely cause congestion and affect market stability. It is heard that these bonds are fully collateralized at a 65% discount with the Central, China, and Communications Banks, and the funds are intended to relieve the market. But with such a large amount of cash flowing out, the financial sector inevitably sells other bonds to supplement funds. Abundant market margins are still due to the impact of accepting financial bonds. Furthermore, it is noted that the 22nd series of ten thousand yuan notes, totaling 2,000, can soon be exchanged for thousand-yuan notes, which will further increase market margins by 20 million. All of these factors have dealt an unexpected blow to long positions. Currently, due to the approaching settlement date, there is still some upward pressure, and it is not yet time to be pessimistic. Yesterday's developments: the market price was chaotic during the morning opening. The dismissal of soldiers' bonds for the current month rose by 0.4 yuan, seemingly with some short squeeze action, and the back series also saw some long squeezes. The market price saw both upward and downward trends. In the second session, the 21st series saw some buying, and short-term traders were also active. Market prices increased by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. The afternoon situation changed slightly. Although the 43rd series still saw some short-term traders, the northern brokers and the 54th series saw significant selling, and the trading floor became looser. Before the opening, there was a firm upward trend, but starting with the salt tax bonds, it was felt that the rally could not be sustained and instead fell by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan to 0.3 yuan. At the close, market sentiment was weak, and selling pressure gradually increased. The impact of financial bonds gradually affected the market, and prices generally weakened, mostly by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan to 0.35 yuan. The current month's 23rd series customs bonds fell sharply by 0.65 yuan. The market price results: the front series saw a few good performances, rising by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan to 0.2 yuan, while the back series mostly fell by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan to 0.55 yuan. The future is temporarily difficult to be optimistic about. The total transaction amount was 9,540,000 yuan. The following is a comparative table of the price increases and decreases.

<h3>New York Stock Market Mixed</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company reports that yesterday (20th) the New York stock market was dull and mixed. Speculators were focused on grain trading, and southwestern winds and sandstorms threatened significant damage to winter wheat, causing grain prices to rise sharply, especially wheat. Tobacco stocks weakened due to the possibility of Pennsylvania taxing cigarettes. Gold mining stocks were firm, silver stocks fell, and copper stocks were stable, in the hope that producers could agree to reduce production. In the bond market, foreign loans fell, especially Belgian government bonds, with new lows frequently seen. American bonds were relatively stable. Stocks on the small exchange rose. Grain prices are difficult to rise further and other goods not affected. Total transactions amounted to 490,000 shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>

<h3>Yarn &amp; Cotton</h3>
<p>Current Month Yarn Drops 1.4 Yuan</p>
<p>Yarn prices fell in the morning and rose in the afternoon, but the current month has shown a weaker trend, dropping 1.4 yuan. Most floating positions were closed out due to the approaching settlement date, but a certain major trader has not yet emerged. Current yarn sales are stagnant, and purchases by various brokers are minimal, which has inevitably affected market sentiment. In the afternoon, prices recovered by several jiao following the rise in raw cotton.</p>
<p>Forward Prices Recover After Falling</p>
<p>The opening prices for the marked yarn market were consistently downward for all months, with a frightened outlook. This was because general floating positions, seeing the deteriorating environment, painfully closed positions, and the selling trend intensified. New lows were found for each month. By closing time, those who had profited bought back slightly. As a result, all months fell by 0.7 to 0.8 jiao, 1 yuan to 1.2 yuan. The afternoon opening was flat. At the third round of auctions, the raw cotton recovered, and the news about American cotton favored long positions. Buyers gathered, and the market was particularly tight. The current month fell by 0.7 jiao, and further months rose by 0.2 - 0.3, 0.6, 0.7, 0.9 jiao. Reported sales: Jifeng 600 bales, Dafeng 150 bales, Daji 1,250 bales, Mingde 750 bales, Minghua 900 bales, Renfeng 1,300 bales, Yuan Yi 1,800 bales, Changfeng 1,250 bales, Yongchang 800 bales, Suilong 700 bales, Jun Chang 1,350 bales, Shen Ji 1,600 bales, Yi Chang 800 bales. Purchases: Zhen Da 1,000 bales, Dafeng 1,250 bales, Yi Da 550 bales, Yuan Da 850 bales, Jin Chang 1,030 bales, Geng Feng 2,900 bales, Xin Cheng 1,450 bales, Changfeng 1,300 bales, Run Kang 1,600 bales.

<p>Guangdong | 145</p>

<h3>Slight Replenishment of Empty Positions in Cotton Speculation</h3>
<p>The cotton market slightly strengthened. In the afternoon, rumors spread that a certain organization had requested the authorities to increase import duties on Indian cotton, causing widespread concern. Short sellers profited, closing their positions. Another report indicated that a consumer cooperative sold 2,000 bales of "Bao" cotton to the Shenxin Factory, which further strengthened the market.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao's General Trend Hesitates</p>
<p>At the opening of the cotton speculation market, prices for all months showed a stagnant trend. The situation remained volatile. U.S. cotton saw a slight increase of five points, while Indian cotton trading was suspended. Prices for the first two trading sessions fell, but around the third session, short covering led to a slight rebound. Consequently, the current month's price fell by 1.5 jiao, while prices for distant months remained unchanged. The afternoon session opened with a flat market, and near-month prices continued to decline. However, during the second and third trading sessions, market sentiment suddenly tightened due to rumors of increased import duties on Indian cotton and speculation of short covering by Japanese traders. All these news benefited the long positions, but the market weakened again towards closing. As a result, prices for all months rose by 1 jiao to 2.5 jiao. Sales volume included Yuan Da 3,400 dan, Yi Chang 1,300 dan, Da Feng 1,300 dan, Ji Feng 2,300 dan, Yu Da 2,400 dan, Ming De 2,100 dan, He Yu 1,900 dan, Ren Feng 2,500 dan, Yuan Yi 3,800 dan, Run Yuan 2,500 dan, Yi Feng 3,000 dan, Xie Cheng 1,600 dan, and Chang Shu 1,800 dan. Purchases included Da Fu 2,700 dan, Tong Ji 3,400 dan, Zhen Da 7,300 dan, Jun Chang 4,100 dan, Chang He 3,000 dan, Rui Da 1,600 dan, Tong Yu 2,000 dan, and Chang Feng 3,400 dan. The highest and lowest prices, as well as closing prices, for the day were as follows:</p>
<p>Cotton Speculation  Highest Price  Lowest Price  Closing Price  Change  Open Interest</p>
<p>March   33.25   32.95   33.25  Down 6.05  29,100</p>

<p>Total   806,700</p>
<p>Factory Demand Remains Fragmented</p>
<p>Sales of spot cotton remain sluggish, and factory demand is characterized by fragmented transactions.</p>

<h3>U.S. Cotton Continues to Strengthen Due to Spot Market Purchases</h3>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton prices were firm, but market activity was slow. At the opening, prices for all months rose by 5 to 9 points due to the previous day's momentum and foreign merchants' purchases. However, prices retreated as local and New Orleans brokers sold. There were buyers when prices fell, but many long positions were closed due to rumors of production cuts at yarn factories and uncertainty surrounding Washington and Europe. Prices recovered due to spot market purchases, and the market ended firmer. Current demand is sluggish, but the basis remains firm, and spot cotton is difficult to purchase in the South. The close was stable. Spot prices rose by 5 points, and futures prices rose by 1 to 4 points. British cotton spot prices fell by 5 points, and futures prices fell by 12 points. Indian cotton trading was suspended. The original telegram is as follows: (Dated the 20th)</p>

<h3>Grains: Flour and Wheat Rise Together Due to Spring Snow</h3>
<p>— Import Wheat Prices Also Rise Again</p>
<p>Flour: After the market opened in the morning, prices for all months showed a uniform surge. Import wheat quotations from Chicago rose by a significant 7 to 8 jiao, and those from Canada rose by 1 jiao. Upon opening, import wheat quotations rose sharply, and because of sudden weather changes, spring snow was seen in the north, which, according to historical patterns, seemed to have a significant impact on the wheat harvest. Therefore, market sentiment was excited, and buyers were very active. A portion of short positions were also actively covered, causing near-term prices to rise by 0.2 fen and distant-term prices to rise by 0.3 to 0.4 fen. This situation was almost entirely driven by weather concerns. When the market opened in the afternoon, trading for all months was still active, but the trend gradually eased as the weather cleared up and some long positions were unwound, causing prices to fall by nearly 0.1 fen compared to the morning. Looking ahead, weather changes are unpredictable, and with the movement to raise the price of import wheat, there may still be changes in the future. As a result, the current month's price rose by 1.75 li, April's price rose by 0.2 fen, May's price rose by 0.225 fen, June's price rose by 0.3 fen, July's price rose by 0.25 fen, and August's price rose by 0.2 fen.</p>
<p>Wheat: After the market opened in the morning, prices for all months generally showed a stable trend. Import wheat quotations from Chicago rose by varying amounts of 7 to 8 jiao, and those from Canada rose by 2 jiao. When opening, given the rise in import wheat quotations and spring snow in various regions, buying interest in all months was strong, and prices also rose by 0.3 to 0.5 fen. However, due to smooth arrivals of spot import wheat, there were lingering concerns, and the price increase was limited. When the market opened in the afternoon, trading had become quiet, with little activity and little price fluctuation. Given this situation, there is unlikely to be excessive price increases. As a result, July's price rose by 0.3 fen, August's price rose by 0.3 fen, and the current month's price rose by 0.6 fen in the morning. The afternoon session did not open. Spot wheat prices did not trade due to customer quotations.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat  19th  20th  Change</p>

<h3>Cold Weather Causes Simultaneous Improvement in Domestic and Imported Rice</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the arrival of rice from out-of-town merchants was scarce. Only numbers 11 and 12 arrived (a total of just over 2,000 shi). Due to the sudden cold weather, market sentiment turned stable, and sales were quite active. There were bulk purchases of over 1,000 bags each by merchants from Tianjin and Yantai. Consequently, prices for all varieties of thick glutinous rice and lower-grade indica rice stabilized, and the situation was even somewhat tight. Du Jian rice did not see much fluctuation, while Yin Yuan rice weakened by nearly a jiao.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Recently, the waterway at Yujidun was blocked for several days due to stone boats running aground, causing a shortage of rice from out-of-town merchants. Although sales in the market were not good, the scarcity of arrivals caused the market price of white glutinous rice to increase by 1 jiao. Bian Yuan and Ke Yuan rice also became tight. Prices for other varieties stabilized, but sales of early-season low-grade indica rice were slow, and prices remained weak.</p>
<p>(Imported Rice) Yesterday, the imported rice market was initially expected to decline as arrivals had been continuous for several days, shaking the confidence of wholesalers. However, after the market opened yesterday morning, the sudden cold weather, which was expected to harm agricultural production, caused market sentiment to turn upwards. Although both arrivals and inventories of spot imported rice were high, local merchants became eager to purchase again, and activity in the interior was even stronger than in Shanghai. Purchases were resumed in Nanjing, providing an opportunity for the market to turn around. Prices for all varieties remained stable only because some traders were seeking to unload their holdings. There were inquiries about futures from both local, inland, and Yangtze River merchants, and new trading was quickly halted. Clearing of inventories led to a price rebound. 500 tons of Saigon long-grain and round-grain rice for March/April delivery were sold, with long-grain rice rising by 0.3 to 0.5 fen and round-grain rice rising by 0.7 to 0.8 fen. The future trend remains firm. Over 12,000 bags of spot rice were traded, mostly purchased by merchants from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Inventories of domestic indica rice were low. Over 400 bags of machine-milled red rice and brown rice were purchased from local merchants, and the market was slightly active.</p>
<h3>Continuous Sales of Soybeans by Oil Mills</h3>
<p>Yesterday's soybean market continued to be stable compared to the previous day as oil mills continued to purchase actively, stabilizing market sentiment. Yesterday's transactions included eleven truckloads of Dalian Sipingjie soybeans at a price of 3.03 yuan, 3,000 bags of Guide soybeans at prices of 3.75 yuan and 3.7 yuan, three truckloads of Quanhe soybeans at prices of 3.67 yuan and 3.65 yuan, three truckloads of Bengbu soybeans at prices of 3.35 yuan and 3.3 yuan, one truckload of Haozhou soybeans at a price of 3.42 yuan, 500 bags of Dangshan soybeans at a price of 3.65 yuan, and 2,000 bags of Hankou truck soybeans at a price of 3.325 yuan. Over 1,000 bags of Hankou Zha soybeans were purchased by local and inland merchants at prices ranging from 3.47 yuan to 3.25 yuan.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods: Qingdao Raw Red Dates Market Price Rebounds</h3>
<p>Previous Two Days' Increase of 8.5 Jiao</p>
<p>The raw red dates market trend turned tight as Qingdao telegraphed a cumulative increase of 8.5 jiao over the previous two days. Owners of higher-quality goods were observing the market and were unwilling to sell. However, ordinary-quality goods continued to be sold. Merchants from Shantou purchased over 1,000 bags of Guide red dates at prices ranging from 5.6 yuan to 5.65 yuan, Dangshan red dates at prices ranging from 5.5 yuan to 5.55 yuan, and lower grades at 5.35 yuan, a rebound of 1.5 jiao compared to the previous level.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Another Batch of Zhizhi Foreign White Sugar Put Up For Sale - Price Already Low, Guard Against Future Rebound</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend showed signs of flatness and weakness again. The association's quotations for grade 24 white sugar were 16.75 yuan, but no deals were made. Re-exported goods were quoted at 4.72 yuan, a decrease of 0.03 yuan, and some transactions took place. Rough Dutch white sugar for import on the 25th was quoted at 4.68 yuan, and French rough white sugar was quoted at 4.6 yuan, with several hundred bags being traded for each. The local factory's refined white sugar market rebounded slightly, with quotations rising by 0.05 yuan. Chaozhou merchants continued to put up for sale a batch of Zhizhi foreign white sugar, totaling 400 to 500 bags, at a price of 12.5 yuan, with lower grades at discounted prices. According to other merchants, this price was already low, and therefore, those with goods on hand were unwilling to continue selling.</p>
<h3>Metals: Tea Merchants Purchase Forward Qing Lead</h3>
<p>Tea merchants have recently become interested in Qing lead, leading to considerable trading in recent days. However, overseas prices are rising steadily, and the exchange rate for pound sterling is not improving. Therefore, there is concern that prices will rise again. Tea merchants and factory users are worried about a resurgence of price increases and are therefore rushing to purchase forward contracts. Yesterday's market transactions reached over 2,000 bars, with prices reportedly at 13.75 yuan per dan.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Ordinary Words</h3>
<p>— Leng Mo</p>
<p>Science excels at categorization. According to physiology, it is easy to classify a living being as female, male, or other categories. However, general society lacks scientific knowledge, and even with it, it is difficult to say whether social events can be handled using scientific methods. By habit, we feel that there are only two genders. Therefore, when a person enters society, they must be either A or B. Because exceptions are rare in fact, this simple classification is maintained, and no one feels the need to dissent. Because there is no dissent, those born as exceptions are unwilling to speak out. Therefore, the number of exceptions remains unknown, but it is probably more than usually imagined. Perhaps after we know a number, we will no longer be surprised by the occasional exception that must be revealed. We are often surprised by such things, which is unfortunate for us, and even more so for the person and event that are surprised.</p>
<p>In anecdotal novels, there are often records of men turning into women and women turning into men. We don't need to pay attention to the accuracy or degree of accuracy of these records, but the view of these two situations is worth noting. Unfortunately, a man turning into a woman is often seen as a demon or due to karma. As for a woman turning into a man, it is often said that her ancestors had accumulated good karma. Because society's views on these two situations are different, when raising an infant of unclear gender, in order to prevent future misfortune, it is often better to temporarily assume that they are female. This is the best choice for the children. For themselves, the biggest trouble for a woman is that she cannot marry when she grows up and must be supported in old age. If the child is considered a man, there are various troubles or even unexpected dangers related to property and career in the old society. If such an exceptional child raised as a female truly leans towards femininity when they grow up, there is not much of a problem. There are even cases where they marry and the husband's family hides the issue. If they grow up and lean towards masculinity, their misfortune is unavoidable. The very few who are so noticeably masculine that they resemble what is generally considered to be male and formally change to male are, of course, the most fortunate. However, the social psychology that determined their past fate and has not yet disappeared will still cast an embarrassing shadow over them.</p>
<p>Modern thinkers often believe in a kind of spiritual androgyny in their views on gender in the future. This is not a new theory. From the oldest religious figures to the latest scholars, many believe that the restraint of primitive desires helps the achievement of career success. Although many theories state that forced abstinence has many drawbacks, the achievements of many who have lived solitary lives in the past prove that drawbacks are not necessarily inevitable. At least, what is lost is worth what is gained. People with physiological abnormalities naturally also have primitive desires, which often makes people feel that it can lead to an abnormal life. However, if they have hope for development in spiritual life, they must be extremely willing to work hard. Although we may not necessarily hope that their achievements will be above ordinary people, we can conclude that they can be the same as ordinary people and there is no difference. Perhaps there are many achievements of this kind of people in academic and artistic achievements, they are fortunate not to be known, and can enjoy their quiet life and achieve something.</p>
<p>Indeed, today's society is different from the past. The status of women is the same as that of men. A person with physiological abnormalities does not need to worry about their gender as much as before, and there is no need to announce it, which would cause everyone to feel surprised. However, it is difficult to say whether we have actually progressed to this point. And to avoid surprise by not being known, these kinds of things are always regarded as unusual. In fact, physiologists are already familiar with a little physiological peculiarity. Since everything else is as ordinary as ordinary people, we should let them express themselves in society like ordinary people.</p>
<h3>Boat Across the Lu River</h3>
<p>— Fei Er</p>
<p>The years stuck on the west bank of the Lu River were like flies stuck on candied fruit: my heart was stuck and felt extraordinarily bored, and my nerves were suffocated by the lazy atmosphere of the long-term heat and felt a little itchy. Watching my youth being eroded and the energy of my life being lost from now on. As soon as Mr. Lin proposed a trip to a different place, the stagnant mood became lively and rippled.</p>
<p>So a sampan was placed in the river. Carrying a small suitcase, I jumped joyfully into the river.</p>
<p>The forests on both sides of the Lu River were illuminated by the bright sunlight, and the earth issued a joyful laugh of life. The water of the Lu River flowed to the sea babbling, life is active without stopping. At the bend of the river, the tide stirred up slight gasps, causing eddies. Watching the round-headed fish often stick their heads out to breathe on the surface of the water, and suddenly sink when reflected by the shadow of the paddle. The breath of this world is so difficult, I and the fish have the same feeling in our hearts.</p>
<p>The grass hut of the fishermen on the shore constantly spit out gray-black smoke. When the sampan went along the shore, the aroma of cooked fish and shrimp could often be smelled. Familiar fishermen often greeted, and human life seemed to be filled with warmth. The fishermen's planks stretched long into the riverbed, and loads of fish and shrimp were carried into the huts. A burst of laughter after the harvest hung on the corners of the fishermen's mouths, and labor showed that it had been rewarded.</p>
<p>The boatman was a Malay in his forties. On the boat were his wife and a five- or six-year-old girl. In the boat, the peaceful and sweet conversations within their family often made me yearn for them. The little girl's brown face flushed red, and her lively and innocent attitude was endearing. Mr. Lin kept praising the Malay way of life; if I were not a modern Chinese, I think I would also like to grow up in the coconut groves.</p>
<p>The western sun shone on the muddy red river water, and an umbrella shaded the two of us. The vast river heart often blew in the tropical breeze, and the river water was fanned into circles of ripples.</p>
<p>A tickling sensation crawled across my nerves, and my heart felt a little dazed. The taste of wandering is eternally lauded, and life is like being filled with the taste of bitter and spicy chili peppers, or mellow old wine.</p>
<p>The journey of a few hours in the water took several turns on the Lu River, and the sluggish journey was filled with Malay whispers. Let the slight sweat soak through the white thin clothes; the Malay boatman mysteriously used a small black mole on my collarbone to determine my life's destiny.</p>
<p>Trying to cover up the wounds of life with a smile, I looked at the great natural scenery and stared at the distant and unknown future. Philosophy will be restricted by narrow minds, but sharp eyes can penetrate the clouds and see the blood-red mist of the West.</p>
<p>Although the sky was bright and clear with only a few thin white clouds, and one corner of the west was red, the sun happily followed the clusters of red mist.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, the mouth of the Lu River was already visible, and a small, short, gray-black house was already exposed on a prominent spot. Behind it was a small row of houses, shining white in the sun.</p>
<p>A small steamboat had just slowly sailed in from the river mouth, preparing to moor in the heart of the river. The Malay child suddenly shouted out in Chinese from his small mouth:</p>
<p>"The ship is coming! The ship is coming!"</p>
<p>So he clapped his light and thin little hands and jumped on the sampan.</p>
<p>A burst of joy in my heart also hooked me up. The child's cry aroused laughter on the whole boat.</p>
<p>Stepping onto the river bank, the feeling of confusion disappeared completely, and a real image flashed up. Looking at the small journey that had just come to an end, the illusion was like a water splash, crushed by reality, like foam on the water wiped away by the wind.</p>
<h3>A Little Compendium of Wandering</h3>
<p>— Lin Jia</p>
<p>When the mandolin plays softly,</p>
<p>It matches the rhythm of this head shaking,</p>
<p>Pour a cup of dark red tea,</p>
<p>Listen to who is striding outside the window.</p>
<p>Maybe there will be wind and rain tonight,</p>
<p>Maybe there will be no stars in the sky tomorrow night,</p>
<p>Listen to the softly playing mandolin,</p>
<p>Matching the staggering footsteps outside the window.</p>
<h3>The Valley of Miasma (Continued Conclusion)</h3>
<p>— Wu Yan</p>
<p>He would always answer like this, but before long, he would start his nagging again, from the demons of miasma to the Baiyi people who could live in it, and how their beautiful women would turn into owls at night to catch people. If it weren't for the constant anxiety in my heart about the miasma, it might have been quite enjoyable to listen and walk along.</p>
<p>Because I was walking fast, he had to hurry to catch up, and soon I couldn't hear him talking, only the sound of his panting. I thought gleefully, "See if you'll still be so talkative!" After walking for a while, he fell behind, and I thought he was going to shout again:</p>
<p>"Wait a minute, don't go so fast!"</p>
<p>To continue the words "She flies at the door latch, like a white butterfly," but he didn't. I turned back curiously to look.</p>
<p>Oh, his face had turned gray and green, large beads of sweat were popping out on his forehead, and thin, clear water was flowing from his nostrils.</p>
<p>"Brother, are you sick?"</p>
<p>I slowed my pace.</p>
<p>"Could it be you've got acute intestinal pain?"</p>
<p>He shook his head and raised his trembling hand to wipe the sweat from his forehead.</p>
<p>"Could it be you've been hit by miasma?"</p>
<p>I looked back in alarm: the sky was darkening, and the valley was exhaling mist.</p>
<p>A figure emerged from the small path in the woods beside the road, startling me.</p>
<p>My traveling companion asked him a question, and he answered, revealing a row of black teeth. Only then did I see clearly that he was carrying a hoe on his shoulder. But I couldn't understand what they were saying, it must have been the Yi language.</p>
<p>While I was still sizing up the back of the black-toothed man, my companion seemed to have regained some of his vitality, nudged my shoulder, and said:</p>
<p>"It's okay, let's go!"</p>
<p>He pulled his sleeve to wipe his nose and forehead, and walked ahead of me with great effort.</p>
<p>"Who was that? A Yi person?"</p>
<p>"Mmm, mmm."</p>
<p>"Hey, I'm asking you! Was that a Yi person?"</p>
<p>"Mmm, yes."</p>
<p>"What did you say to him just now?"</p>
<p>"Mmm, mmm. Don't talk, let's talk at the inn!"</p>
<p>He now seemed to dislike my nagging, quickly cutting off my questions with a rough voice, and quickly quickening his pace.</p>
<p>Thinking about how I had been urging him earlier, and now he was urging me, I couldn't help but smile.</p>
<p>"I thought you were sick just now, judging by this, you could still go to battle!"</p>
<p>He didn't answer, just kept walking.</p>
<p>Turning past the woods, two thatched houses with bamboo walls appeared in the stifling heat and twilight. A pole with children's clothes hanging on it was drying in front of the door.</p>
<p>My traveling companion walked towards the thatched house, saying:</p>
<p>"Let's rest here and then continue on our way, this is a Baiyi family."</p>
<p>Regardless of whether I agreed or not, he lifted the bamboo door and went inside.</p>
<p>I hurried in, complaining to him.</p>
<p>"It's going to be dark soon, why are we still dawdling!"</p>
<p>The house was dark. A bed with an oil lamp lit, casting a faint yellow light, squatted in the corner of the wall. My traveling companion was lying right on it, staring blankly at the opium bubble being roasted on the lamp - it was the Baiyi host sleeping opposite him, roasting it for him.</p>
<p>A woman with a foot-high black turban wrapped around her head let me sit on a bench, and I thought anxiously... Why am I staying here to be a sacrifice to the miasma? Seeing my traveling companion comfortably taking a long puff of opium, I slapped the bench and asked angrily...</p>
<p>"Brother, how can you be so muddleheaded, have you forgotten that the miasma comes out at night?"</p>
<p>He raised his opium pipe and waved it, saying humorously:</p>
<p>"With this gun in my hand, am I still afraid of it?"</p>
<p>I walked out of the house without a word, walking along the dark road and thinking: Traveling with such a Chinese person is truly the unluckiest thing ever.</p>

<p>My father returned in triumph.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, my uncle also returned.</p>
<p>Nearby, the adjacent row of houses was celebrating the triumph, it was very lively. My home was also disturbed by the big drums and old sanxian for more than three days.</p>
<p>My father, whom I hadn't seen for two years, was darker and thinner than before. Moreover, he always had an expression as if he were a guest, and was very gentle to us children.</p>
<p>My father, wearing an old black flower gown, sat in the middle of the guests, smiling happily at the gentle villagers. Among the guests, some remarkable people also came. The first was the village head. Although it was only for an hour or so, he said many things to my father, who was apprehensive, before leaving, such as: "You've worked hard..." "Congratulations on your triumphant return." "This is also due to the Emperor's might," and so on. The villagers, who had previously not even bothered to turn their heads, also specially spoke flattering words and came to congratulate him. Huimei's grandfather also came. I was overjoyed.</p>
<p>For about half a year after the war ended, there were various celebrations of triumph. My father would take me along and often bring back bottled wine and food stored in boxes. When the Triumphant Celebration was held in the sacred garden of Kato Kiyomasa, enshrined in Honmyo-ji Temple, I would also follow my father, who had a white copper leaf badge and a military badge hanging in front of him. When women with reddened faces from drinking dressed up as soldiers, dragged long swords with a clatter, and shouted "Banzai! Banzai!" into the banquet hall, the officers stroking their long hair would also smile and hug the women.</p>
<p>One hundred and fifty yuan was issued from above as a reward to my father, who was "Eighth Class Order of Merit, Eighth Class Merit." Since his triumphant return, he hadn't done much odd jobs for others, so he used that money as capital to start driving a freight wagon. My father, who originally didn't have a fixed occupation, learned to lead horses during the war, which enabled him to start that kind of business.</p>
<p>One very lucky night, an old chestnut mare with only one eye was brought over by my grandfather and father, who had been horse traders when they were young. And, they built a shed behind the row of houses and put the horse inside.</p>
<p>Before a year had passed since the war, the very severe recession came. My father, who had started a freight wagon business, had many days when he had nothing to do.</p>
<p>"What freight wagon, it's better not to do it. Every day there's nothing to do, the horse and the people have to eat, how can we maintain it..."</p>
<p>My mother often said these words, questioning my father. Since his triumphant return, his mind seemed to be less clear than before.</p>
<p>"A-Zhi, go and ask if there's any freight to transport today."</p>
<p>Whenever he was questioned by my mother, my father, who was always silent, would call me over and ask me to go to Yicheng Company to ask "if there's any freight."</p>
<p>At Yicheng Company, at the junction of the village end and the township, dozens of white-walled rice warehouses were lined up. When the market was good, the warehouses here were empty, and the rice was moved out of the warehouses. Hundreds of freight wagons lined up, making magnificent shouts, and went back and forth to Kumamoto Station and Kumamoto Station. This Yicheng Company, which held the throat of Higo rice, especially the production areas of Yamaga, Kikuchi, Ozu, and Aso, had a branch office of the Rice Inspection Office and branches of Higo Bank and Hokuto Bank.</p>
<p>Because I went there often, I was very familiar with the situation there. When I came home from school and passed in front of these warehouses, I would often pay attention to see if there was any freight to transport and if my father was there, and I could naturally and indirectly confirm it: this had already become my habit.</p>
<p>Recently, there were very few days when there was freight to transport. However, the state of rice production in the farmers' families had not changed at all. The amount of rice and miscellaneous grains transported out by the farmers, five bags, ten bags, was truly astonishing; even before the harvest, there were often many rice grains being peddled in front of the warehouse store.</p>

<h3>Yao Jinping Turns From Female to Male</h3>
<p>— Xia Yun</p>
<p>So That's How It Is – Much Ado About Nothing</p>
<p>The news of Yao Jinping turning from female to male caused a sensation not only in the whole country, but even among Europeans and Americans living in China, such as Mr. Feibai, the Chief of Police of the French Concession, who wanted to see Yao in person as soon as possible. It also aroused deep concern among medical circles. Who knew that after examination by the National Shanghai Medical College on Haig Road, Yao Jinping was still a woman, and there was absolutely no change in her physiology. A mystery was completely cleared up, it was truly ridiculous.</p>
<p>I think the reason why Yao Jinping suddenly had this strange idea and acted so cunningly was entirely because she was eager to go to Xinjiang to find her father, but she was afraid that a female expedition would be inconvenient in many ways, so she had no choice but to do this. But before General Li Du proposed sending her to the National Shanghai Medical College for examination, she would inevitably have to show her true colors when she reached the end of her rope. At that time, she should have told the truth and saved a lot of trouble. However, she did not do so. After the examination, it turned out that that was how it was, and only then did the truth come out. She was truly foolish in the extreme.</p>
<p>Therefore, I think there are many things in the world that can be viewed in this way. Unless you see them with your own eyes, all strange rumors are not to be believed. However, although Yao Jinping's actions were said to be out of filial piety and for the convenience of a distant expedition, she had no choice but to do this. But in ancient times, women disguised as men, either to find their husbands or to fight in battles, secretly disguised themselves, and privately investigated. This kind of situation was originally a common occurrence in our country's novels. Why did Yao Jinping exaggerate her words and cause a national sensation? This is also something that cannot be measured by reason.</p>
<p>Moreover, recently, the strange things reported in the newspapers have been emerging one after another. For example, in Hongkou Lane Hongqiao, a large rat ran under the God of Wealth, and the God of Wealth Temple suddenly collapsed. Last year, at the Great East Gate of Shanghai, a large snake fell from the sky due to lightning. Also, a human-faced spider was found in a civilian's house in Madian, Hankou. And, a sleeping beauty was discovered in a certain country, who slept for two years and nine months. These are all strange news that cannot be verified. But Yao Jinping, although a woman, was the subject of many rumors, and most people paid attention to her, so that General Li Du was also driven by curiosity to send her to the hospital for examination. Who knew that the magic trick was not real and was immediately exposed in court? This was something that not only General Li Du did not expect, but also something that Yao Jinping did not expect.</p>
<p>Yao Jinping's purpose in turning from female to male was only out of a filial heart to go on a distant expedition to find her father. In this way, her plan to find her father completely failed. But I think that as a result, she may be able to achieve her goal of finding her father. Assuming that her father is still alive, someone will definitely tell her father about this matter, and her father will naturally send a letter to inform her of his current address. Then Yao Jinping will not have to look for her father anymore, and her father will find her. In this way, Yao Jinping's actions are more effective than a full-page advertisement for a year, and this is also something that Yao Jinping did not originally expect.</p>
<h3>Old Residence</h3>
<p>— Luo Han</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, it has been a year since the past events. Jing was still studying at the K Girls' School in the northern suburbs of Shanghai at that time, and I also lived with her in a small village near the school for economic reasons.</p>
<p>A winding blue water river surrounds it, with many cargo ships floating on the river. All around are endless green fields, dense green forests, and when the reddish-brown Songhu mini-train passes by, a cloud-like white smoke fills the treetops and is blown away by the wind, like a lively silver dragon.</p>
<p>In the ancient temple in the west of the village, every time the setting sun shines, a deep and long bell sound is emitted, crowding with Roman</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>ancient style.</p>
<p>Our residence was in a south-facing black house along the river. The architecture was a combination of Chinese and Western styles, surrounded by low bamboo fences, which were covered with various kinds of rose flowers. In front of the door was a vegetable garden of about two acres, planted with seasonal vegetables, interspersed with a little red and green wildflowers. When you opened the French window, a gentle breeze blew in the fragrant aroma of wildflowers.</p>
<p>The landlord was a very kind old lady. Her husband had passed away early, leaving behind a son and two daughters, who made a living on a small inheritance. From her mottled gray hair and wrinkled face, you could tell that she had tasted some of the bitterness of life.</p>
<p>Her two daughters were both married, and her youngest son was still studying in middle school, so the house was particularly deserted. At the same time, because of the desolation, it increased her old man's goodwill towards us. She worshiped the Buddha and spent a lot of time chanting scriptures and worshiping Buddha every day. However, she also often came to talk to us, telling us many stories she had experienced when she was young. She told us in detail about the Taiping Rebellion.</p>
<p>Naturally, we were very satisfied with such a landlord and the quiet environment. At that time, we were really happy. Jing went out to study every day, and I went out to work every day. When we were free after work, we would lead a group of neighboring children to play various interesting games, teach them to sing, teach them to dance, and sometimes buy a lot of fruit and eat with them. Or, when the sun went down, we would hold hands and go to the sentry post outside the door to see the crimson setting sun, slowly passing through the brown-colored rosy clouds, sinking into the western mountains. Listening to the deep and long bell sound from the ancient temple, we forgot all our sorrows, we forgot all the troubles and trivial matters in the world.</p>
<p>But good times don't last long, and smoke and clouds are easy to disperse. The petals of the roses were blown off by the bleak autumn wind, and when the autumn insects began to wail, Jing finally left Shanghai for something and separated from me. With a lonely heart, after Pin left, I also moved from that quiet place to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Now it is spring again. By an unexpected chance, I passed by the old residence that I had been away from for a long time. The winding river, the endless green fields, the dense green forests, the black house surrounded by low bamboo fences, the green lawn, the warm spring breeze, welcomed the landlord's kind smiling face, and a group of naive children. Everything, the scene is still the same. The old residence is still there, but unfortunately, the old friend is no longer in front of me.</p>
<h3>Murder Case</h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>The news of Jin Ge Sao's suicide by hanging reached Dongcun around lunchtime.</p>
<p>Her brother, Fu Cai, was a brainless man. He saw his sister return to Ning, and only after his parents repeatedly persuaded her did she return to her husband's home with eyes swollen like walnuts from crying. Now, when he heard that his sister had committed suicide by hanging, he threw his rice bowl a zhang away and grabbed the hoe in the corner of the room to avenge his sister.</p>
<p>The messenger was Chu Fu Cai's eldest sister's husband, who lived in Xicun with Jin Ge's family. He had learned the news of his wife's sister's suicide early in the morning, but Jin Ge's mother tried her best to hide it. This old woman was known throughout the village as a shrew. Everyone guessed that there would be discord between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law after Jin Ge got married; even Jin Ge'er, whom this old woman loved like a treasure, was scolded and beaten every day, on the grounds that he had a wife and no mother. According to the rumors in Xicun, the young couple got along very well, and Jin Ge'er was still very considerate to his mother and always advised his wife to be patient. This time, when Jin Ge Sao returned to Ning, the old woman slapped her daughter-in-law for no reason, saying that she was stealing men in her parents' home. When her son tried to persuade her, he was bitten twice on the arm. In the morning, Jin Ge Sao hanged herself in the woodshed.</p>
<p>The old woman, seeing that she had caused a great disaster, forced her son to bury his wife and pretended to go to his wife's family to welcome her back, so as to shift the responsibility to her parents' home. But Jin Ge'er couldn't bear it, and the mother and son quarreled, revealing the matter.</p>
<p>Fu Cai's eldest sister's husband traveled more than ten miles to Dongcun to deliver the news. Seeing that Fu Cai was angry, he quickly grabbed his brother-in-law's hand and said, "Let's discuss it properly."</p>
<p>The result was that the whole family went to Xicun to reason.</p>
<p>The mouths in the countryside are as swift as the wind. Jin Ge's house was surrounded by many people, and in the chaotic voices, you could hear the loud voice of "Damn old woman!" from afar, but no one stood up to resolve this murder case, always maintaining this disturbance.</p>
<p>When Jin Ge Sao's family arrived, the crowd shouted even louder, "Kill the old woman!" and tightened their encirclement.</p>
<p>Fu Cai was the first to rush into the house, like a wild bull freed from its tether, grabbing the old woman and beating her. This was a good show that the audience was hoping for. Although his parents and eldest sister's husband tried their best to pull him away, the enthusiastic family voice was booming like spring thunder, and naturally there were some cheers.</p>
<p>The old woman lay on the ground and refused to get up, her hair disheveled, crying loudly as if her husband had died: "You hit people... good... I'll sue the official!"</p>
<p>Jin Ge'er stood blankly by his wife's corpse, his head down. He did not see this lively scene that was almost like watching a village opera. He looked at his wife's pale face, torn by conflicting justice. However, the old woman cried more and more fiercely, like a mad dog, and the people from Jin Ge Sao's family joined the crowd of onlookers, not knowing what to do.</p>
<p>This tragicomedy cried and quarreled until the sun set in the west, when a village head with high shoulders pushed his way into the crowd. He used his official language to drive away the idlers and took the people involved to the police station.</p>
<p>This is a real event that I personally experienced in a certain village. The result is something that can never be believed: "Acquittal"—on both sides.</p>

<h3>Xiling Gorge</h3>
<p>— Bing Bai</p>
<p>When the boat passed Nanjin Pass in Yichang, it seemed to have entered another world. The mountains on both sides gradually became narrow and narrow, and the river water was no longer as calm as before. One wave chased after another, rushing and roaring; and the small wooden boat we were sitting on was like a clumsy pig, swaying uncertainly in the heart of the river. Fortunately, we were here to visit Xiling Gorge, not to rush on our way for important matters. Otherwise, seeing the boat's clumsy appearance, it would really be infuriating.</p>
<p>The mountains here seem to be competing with the sky, one higher than the other; inserted into the clouds, sometimes, you can't see the top of the mountain at all from the boat. The mountain peaks are piled with white clouds, and people can't see clearly whether it is white clouds or mountain peaks. It is now March, and in Jiangnan, it is already the season of miscellaneous flowers and trees; however, here, the wind is roaring in the gorge, as if it is still the severe winter; what the eyes see is nothing else, in front is the mountain, behind is the mountain, left is also the mountain, right is also the mountain, even the vast sky is blocked by the mountain, only revealing half a face to give us a wry smile; we are groping forward in the land of mountains.</p>
<p>"What, is it going to be dark? The sun has already set." I asked the boatman strangely.</p>
<p>"Sir, it's still early, the sun is blocked by the top of the mountain." The boatman answered me with a smile; I then knew that what the Commentary on the Water Classic said about the Three Gorges, "Without stopping at noon or midnight, you can't see the bright moon," was not lying. People in other places see the sun for twelve hours every day, but here, the sun can only stay for two or three hours, which is also a very interesting life.</p>
<p>The boat barely turned a bend and was still surrounded by mountains. Looking ahead, it seemed that there was no way out. Looking behind, it seemed that there was no way back: where did we come from, where are we going? Li Bai said: "The water of the Yellow River comes from the sky." In this situation, it can also be said that the water of the Yangtze River comes from the mountains. If water were not a flowing thing, the mountain would really swallow the water; what's the point of just looking at the mountains, I grumbled; really, it's so stiff and lifeless; I regret coming this time.</p>
<p>"Sir: don't look at the foot of the mountain, look at the top of the mountain, there are many interesting things on the mountain peaks!" The boatman still said to me with a smile; so, he pointed me out, this is the Beauty Peak, this is the Widow's Cliff, I looked along his direction, and it turned out that the mountain is also the same as a woman, her beauty is on her head, not at her feet.</p>
<p>On the mountain peaks, just talking about her form, there are thousands of changes, some are like tropical beasts, some are like giants in fairy tales, some are beautiful women with open arms waiting to be embraced, some are young women with their heads down lamenting; like pens like knives, like beasts like people, the mountain peaks are just like the ever-changing white clouds, this mountain peak is different from that mountain peak. The withered pine hangs in the middle of the cliff, with her own style of standing proudly alone, the mountain birds coming and going by the river and mountains also have their own pleasure; wildflowers are blooming, and miscellaneous trees are growing densely. The strangest thing is that the monkeys on the mountain cover their ears when they hear the whistle of the steamboat and hide in the crevices of the rocks. If it is the small wooden boat we are riding, no matter how you threaten or scold it, it will ignore you. According to the boatman, there used to be more monkeys in the past, but now they are gradually decreasing year by year.</p>
<p>"What, are those people on top?" I suddenly saw a few people wriggling in the middle of the cliff. That is a cliff as sharp as a knife, and below is the turbulent Yangtze River. If you are not careful and jump down, your corpse will be gone.</p>
<p>"They are cutting grass on top, to make a living, there is no other way, they are all used to it, they wear nailed shoes on their feet, and it is rare to fall down." The boatman explained, and I thought, man is really an unfortunate creature, for the sake of living, they are willing to take any risks.</p>
<p>That night, we stayed in Nantuo, and tomorrow, we will pass the most dangerous Xintan in Xiling Gorge.</p>
<h3>The Home of Marble</h3>
<p>— Jingfu</p>
<p>In the summers of Lingnan, the elegant ancestral hall doors in my hometown faced the refreshing southern breeze. Children loved to place their nimble feet on the two marble stones beside the door. The smooth, cool marble felt so comfortable, it was as if their bones had softened! In those childhood days, I would squint my little eyes, wondering if the marble came from a foreign country. It was said to be produced in Dali, but I couldn't quite grasp where Dali was!</p>
<p>Dali had always been vague and distant. But once I saw Dali, it was like waking from a long, beautiful dream, so enchanting was the landscape!</p>
<p>The snow-capped Cangshan Mountains, the moon reflected on Erhai Lake, the flowers of Shangguan, the winds of Xiaguan, this is the exquisitely wonderful home of marble!</p>
<p>The towering Cangshan Mountains seem to isolate Dali from the outside world. Facing Erhai Lake in front, gazing at the azure waves of Erhai, one feels as if smiling at a heavenly mirror. Surrounded by vast and serene green mountains and lively, gentle green waters, the air is clear and pure. Cangshan and Erhai embrace each other, encircling Dali in a shape like a fish's belly.</p>
<p>The snow on Cangshan has earned it the nickname "Silver Cang." The weather in Dali is not cold; it's like spring all year round. However, Cangshan is covered with thick snow year-round, never experiencing a day without clouds. The snow is as white as silver, oh, what a silver mountain! The people of Dali live year-round in this embrace of clear air. With the snow as white as silver, the foothills of Cangshan lush and green, and the Erhai Lake as clear as a mirror, its vastness, freedom, and serenity make one yearn for it all the more in these smog-filled civilized cities.</p>
<p>From beginning to end, Cangshan Mountain is densely connected with nineteen magnificent and elegant peaks, with eighteen streams nestled between them, each boasting countless scenic wonders. The mountain's terrain is solid, the rocks treacherous, and the thick, year-round snow accumulates on the mountains. Streams and waterfalls flow freely everywhere. There is no way to climb Cangshan and cross over its summit from behind Cangshan outside of Dali! Nor can one descend Cangshan from the summit on the front side. Similarly, there is no path to reach the summit from the foothills of Cangshan within Dali. But ingeniously, from the head to the tail of Cangshan, there is a flat top like a huge road, directly connecting the entire mountain, preventing people from going up or down, but allowing them to travel from end to end, enjoying the scenery, a vista more exquisite than anything man-made!</p>
<p>In the middle of the wondrously high and dangerous Cangshan Mountains, a band of white clouds hovers, like a white jade belt, a beautiful sight from afar, which the people of Dali call "Jade Belt Locking Cangshan." Airy and ethereal, the people under Cangshan must truly feel a bit like immortals! They might even be willing to plunge into the beautiful waves of Erhai Lake before them, to wash away the dirt and dust from their bodies!</p>
<p>The sea and mountains embrace Dali tightly, seemingly leaving no way through, but precisely where the sea and mountains meet, there is a narrow passage like a winding path, gently leading, as if drifting into a dream, into the welcoming embrace of Dali, like a suddenly opening Peach Blossom Spring!</p>
<p>Approaching the side of Dali, Cangshan is in front. Right at the entrance, Shangguan, there is the Nine Bend Bridge, and at the exit, Xiaguan, there is the Black Dragon Bridge. Crossing the Nine Bend Bridge, a mountain slope rises diagonally, like a ladder. One can only walk in from here, reaching the top of the slope, and then suddenly slip into the mouth of Dali.</p>

<h3>Introducing Some "Handwritten Characters"</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>"Handwritten characters" are undoubtedly much simpler than standard characters. In the past, when writing important documents, one had to write each stroke very carefully and correctly. For example, when writing the words "灑掃" (sǎ sǎo, to sweep and clean), one had to write them in their complex forms, "灑掃," and could not write them as "洒扫." At that time, although we knew that "灑掃" and "洒扫" were the same, we dared not simplify, because people said that these simplified characters were not formal and could not be presented "in polite society." Now it's different. These "not formal" handwritten characters, through the promotion of the government and general literati, have attracted a lot of attention, and three hundred handwritten characters have already been cast into lead type, and a few new magazines have adopted them. I think there are many benefits to these handwritten characters. First, they save time, and they are also easy to learn and write, which is of great help in promoting cultural work. I hope that all newspapers and books will use them as much as possible.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. said that readers could write out the handwritten characters they know that have not been included in the three hundred characters and publish them in the mailbox for reference by those who promote handwritten characters, so I am writing down the characters I know and often use. If there are any mistakes, I hope everyone will correct them. Respectfully,</p>

<h3>The Life of Maureen O'Sullivan We Should Know</h3>
<p>— Yi Ji</p>
<p>Maureen O'Sullivan, the couple in "Tarzan the Ape Man," her healthy physique, beautiful face, and natural and lively performance have long been firmly etched in our minds. Not long ago, she also played an innocent young sister in "A Family Affair," adding a lot of color to the film. The three main actors of "A Family Affair," Norma Shearer, Frederic March, and Charles Laughton, are all winners of Hollywood's artistic gold medals and are among the best in the American film industry, but Maureen O'Sullivan's relaxed and natural performance almost surpassed them. But what do we know about her? This is what the reporter wants to tell everyone.</p>
<p>The reason we should get to know her sooner is that she doesn't want to spend her life in the film industry. Her coming to Hollywood is of an "amateur" nature. She wants to marry and have children. These may soon become facts, preventing us from seeing her acting on the screen again. Maureen O'Sullivan has never relied on publicity agents to gain fame. In America, it is because her performance is outstanding that the audience wants to know everything about her. We also want to know her automatically.</p>
<p>Maureen is the eldest of a family of five. Her father is a retired British army officer. She was born in Dublin, Ireland, so she is Irish. When she was eleven years old, her father sent her to a monastery in London to study. Before she was sixteen, she was expelled from the school. The reason for her expulsion was "disobeying teachers and refusing to repent despite repeated warnings." Maureen said, "A student with such a title, which other school would dare to take me in?" Therefore, she broke away from school life.</p>
<p>Soon she went to Versailles, France, to study, because that was a necessary course for fashionable British children. She was in France for only six months before returning to her home in Ireland, playing carefree. Her playmates were all children of military officers. At that time, she never dreamed of being involved in the film industry. She might have married a young military officer and that would have been the end of it. Unexpectedly, Hollywood stretched out its arms and snatched her away.</p>
<p>At that time, the famous director Frank Borzage of Fox Film Corporation was filming John McCormack's Song of My Heart in the Irish capital. One evening, this film crew accidentally stepped into a dance hall. Among hundreds of happy men and women, Frank Borzage suddenly saw Maureen and paid great attention to her. He wrote a note, instructed the waiter to deliver it to her, and asked to talk to her. Maureen heard that this famous American director wanted to talk to her, and she was moved and nodded in agreement. Frank Borzage then ran over and told her that he was looking for a female lead, and she was exactly the person he was looking for.</p>
<p>Maureen knew that her family would definitely oppose her making movies. Therefore, she did not tell her family, but went to the place where Frank Borzage worked every day to watch them filming. She did this for four consecutive days. On the last day of the fourth day, Frank Borzage called her over, put makeup on her, taught her a few lines, and pushed her in front of the camera to start the audition. Maureen felt inexplicable, but she was a talented actress, and the results of the audition were surprisingly good. The next day, Frank Borzage ran to her home and negotiated with her parents. As a result, her mother agreed to accompany her daughter to Hollywood. This was the beginning of Maureen O'Sullivan's arrival in Hollywood, when she was only eighteen years old.</p>
<p>After everything was settled in Hollywood, her mother returned home satisfied. Because Fox Film Corporation did not reuse her, she was signed by MGM after filming a few ordinary films. In addition to being recognized by people for the first time in "Tarzan the Ape Man" and becoming famous in "A Family Affair," she also played the role of David's wife, Dora, in Charles Dickens' famous book "David Copperfield." But although she enjoyed the status of a star, she had a very indifferent view of the film industry or Hollywood. She always maintained her amateur and non-professional attitude.</p>
<p>"Acting"? She said, "I don't feel particularly interested. I am naturally lazy and don't like this heavy work. My fame is entirely due to luck. I have no ambition to be in the film industry, nor do I have any ambition. I am not saying this because I am not grateful, but I always feel that being at home is more happier and freer. Only two things forced me to move forward: one is to accumulate money so that I can be economically independent in the future; the other is vanity, which makes me want to achieve something after I have been in Hollywood for three or four years."</p>
<p>That's right, Maureen doesn't have much money, and she is too lazy, but she will definitely be able to get her wish in the future. As for her achievements, they are already quite impressive. She is only twenty-two years old now.</p>
<h3>Review of "Beauty's Heart"</h3>
<p>— Hua Lun</p>
<p>——New Light Cinema——</p>
<p>"Beauty's Heart," originally titled "Changbai Mountains and Heilongjiang," is showing this year, which quite reminds us of a page of cartoons between the Changbai Mountains and Heilongjiang. Although this cartoon is made like a mirror covered with sand and dust due to the pressure of certain social customs, this mirror still reflects some faces of those who recognize thieves as fathers and the postures of the large group of people struggling for survival. Therefore, "Beauty's Heart" should receive a higher valuation in the original intention of grasping the theme.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to the author's lack of seriousness in the recognition and performance attitude of his own caught great subject, it reduced its due achievement. Naturally, we do not necessarily disagree with the author's use of something like quinine with a sugar coating, such as the "Beauty's Heart" wearing a love romance coat, given the difficulties encountered in some current works that reflect reality, but quinine with an overly thick sugar coating will become sweet candy, just as "Beauty's Heart" has, because the romance coat is too thick, giving people the impression of admiring it as a hero in distress, a young lady rescuing him, and then a happy ending, these old clichés, and ignoring the opposite side, also causing the author to suffer unexpected losses, so-called counterproductive effect. This is a technical problem of expression, and it is also a problem of the attitude of recognition and handling of this issue. Due to the lack of technical expression, Li Duo is written without personality and becomes a mythologized figure. There are no appropriate reasons and arrangements for Su Ru's selfish love for him and her father's sympathy for him. As for the peasant couple, as soon as they heard that he was a "fugitive," they merely said he was a "fugitive" and wholeheartedly regarded him as a national hero, which is too hasty. Due to the lack of understanding of the difficult and painful national tragedy of this nation's resistance against the enemy, the attitude of handling it is inevitably not serious enough. Also, Su Ru carried Li Feng's photo on her maid's body and moved into her home at once. In this family where traitors of the type who recognize thieves as fathers often came, she actually openly rode in and out on horseback and was able to talk love in the back garden, etc. This ignores the serious oppression of the country-destroying people who are densely covered with scouts and strict inspections, and thus weakens the dramatic and touching effect. As for the person who is a consultant of a certain country, these are all very meticulous people, but they would say secrets to some military officers and Han Jian in front of irrelevant old men. Similarly, the commander's office and reception room would be combined into one place, allowing Su Ru to see him stamping important official documents, etc., which is too theatrical! In addition, the part where the Han uncle and nephew gave gifts to Su Ru at the same time is also inconsistent with the identity of the commander Han Jian and Su Ru. Naturally, these are still small details. Let's give another example. When Li Feng and his army, who were seeking welfare for the people, came to fight, the author called Mo Zhi to order the soldiers to revolt. On the screen, the revolt was successful, but in fact, such opportunistic people would never exist in the competition of life and death, right?</p>
<p>From the entire performance point of view, "Beauty's Heart" has mediocre achievements. However, the director inevitably has regrets about taking care of one thing while losing sight of the other when encountering two aspects of depiction. Often, one side is a long paragraph, and the other side is another start, which cannot be intertwined multiplicatively, making the book more lively. The light is more astringent than bright.</p>
<p>Xu Xinyuan and Hu Die are the best in acting skills.</p>
<h3>Review of "A Generation of Heroes"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Jew Suss—Cathay</p>
<p>First, I must state that I have not read the original novel of "Jew Suss," so I can only base my criticism on what is shown on the screen. Like "The House of Rothschild" starring George Arliss and "The Wandering Jew" starring Conrad Veidt, it uses the painful and tragic experiences of the stateless Jewish people as the theme of the film. Precisely because the Jews have no country, and precisely because they have suffered the pain of national subjugation, films with a sense of justice reflect their lives and the common hatred of the Jewish people in film. This not only has great artistic value, but more importantly, it has great significance in promoting the spirit of resistance of oppressed nations.</p>
<p>The Joseph Süss presented here may be seen by some as a fool. Such individualistic heroic resistance, viewed from the perspective of the current stage of weak national revolutionary movements, cannot but be considered a mistake in action. However, the author's resentment towards national subjugation, which is entrusted in him, as well as the discrimination and cruel mistreatment they suffered from the Germanic people, in any case aroused the enthusiastic sympathy of the audience. Moreover, this hero bravely sacrificed himself for his nation. In this respect alone, compared with the oppression suffered by the Chinese nation from imperialism, and the pain we have experienced under the iron heel of imperialism, it undoubtedly gives us great stimulation. Therefore, it is very meaningful that this film is shown in China.</p>
<p>"A Generation of Heroes" is a successful work of art. Due to the seriousness of the content, the director, Lothar Mendes, expresses it in a very heavy tone. The playwright's grasp of the script is extremely successful; there are no tasteless transition scenes, only dramatic developments. The director's successful creation of a heavy atmosphere allows every audience member to feel "a heavy oppression of breathing," which is something people dare not ignore.</p>
<p>Of course, this film would not have achieved such success without Conrad Veidt's magical performance. Due to the director's very skillful handling, several scenes are truly surprisingly successful. For example, when Süss returns to his mother's old home, there is a boiling cheer outside, and he embraces his mother with fervent, pure love. He speaks to his compatriots from the window, and the mother and son are intoxicated by the glory of the nation. Until he sees his mother's love letter and learns that he is of German blood, which causes him to show his wavering national consciousness to his revered uncle. His inner pain and contradiction reach the highest level of success. Also, when he learns of his daughter's tragic death, he uncovers the white cloth on the corpse, and he falls heavily beside the body. That silent grief, until he shouts "Long live the Jews!" in front of the door, the process from grief to frenzy, gives people great emotion.</p>
<p>In addition, when he makes Karl die of anger, his gnashing of teeth and curses in Karl's ear, as well as his final moments before execution, are the highest expressions of his acting skills. As for Frank Vospar, who plays Karl, although he also achieves a lot, he is a bit over the top. Everyone else is very dutiful.</p>
<p>In short, this is a successful work.</p>

<h3>India's National Hatred (Cave Of India) (7)</h3>
<p>— Mao De</p>
<p>In a little while, that person was already standing in front of her. He looked at her silently and motionless for a long time, then took a step forward and shouted in a very urgent voice: "You are Margaret... yes...; you are Margaret." At this time, he felt that she was the person he had been thinking about in his dreams. But she was even more beautiful than he had imagined in his dreams. Margaret murmured, "The welcome party... the governor..." She tried her best to maintain her composure. Clive asked again: "Let them wait a while. You just tell me... you came here to marry me, didn't you? Please tell me. Of course it is, isn't it?" He was very sure that there was no other answer except yes.</p>
<p>Margaret tried her best to say "no" to maintain her shaky girlish dignity, but when she opened her mouth, she only said a "yes", and stammered with the addition of "that's right." After a while, she suddenly turned her head and shouted, "Oh, no!" Clive couldn't help shouting wildly, "Oh, nothing could be better!" She was the only good woman in his eyes! Margaret also said: "But! You don't know, it's not like before now." Clive thought for a while and said: "Are you talking about me? I really shouldn't have run in to see you in this state: I'm covered in dust and dirt..." Margaret took another step closer and said: "No, no. I said... you are a big man now - you have conquered all of India." Clive laughed and said: "This is just the beginning! In the future, you will also build a big house in Berkeley Square... and high carriages and horses... and one day you will be a duchess!"</p>
<p>Margaret smiled and said: "Is there nothing else besides that?" Clive suddenly said respectfully: "There's also my person, if it's worth you wanting." Margaret said: "Just your person is enough." He grabbed her hand. Suddenly remembering the dirt on his body, he hurriedly apologized: "I'm sorry, my hands, my clothes, are not worthy of touching you." Margaret looked at him for a while, and felt that he was a man of his word, and her heart silently agreed. She took a step forward and kissed him on the lips.</p>
<p>Clive couldn't help shouting after being kissed by her, "Ah, she is truly a brave woman. Okay, let's go. Let's go to the welcome party together. Isn't this a good start?" Margaret said: "Start?" Clive said: "That's right, the start of our life together." Margaret said: "I hope that the ending, when it comes, will be just like this."</p>
<p>They arrived at the meeting place and walked towards the platform where the governor was sitting, amidst the cheers of the crowd. Clive was as high as a person, and Margaret's attitude was very calm, although the hand she had on his arm was trembling slightly. The governor stood up very kindly to welcome them when he saw them approaching. Clive then introduced Margaret. He said she was his future wife. Margaret hurriedly bowed to the governor, and also thanked the public one by one for their salutes.</p>
<p>Finally, they returned to their hometown of England as a couple. They lived in a beautiful house in Queen Square. They were already rich and noble.</p>
<p>But Clive was thinking about a greater and more glorious future. Although according to Margaret's original intention, it would be enough if she and her husband could live together in a small cottage forever, Clive felt that while children are affectionate, heroes are not short of breath. He was determined to conquer the world for the beauty and place it at her feet, so as to win her admiration, joy, and heart. (To be continued)</p>
