<p>— 道</p>
<p>昨日報載。實業部鑒於國內工商業日趨衰落。已訂定辦法。實行貿易統制。是誠我國振衰救弊之唯一要圖。値得全國人士之一致擁護者。按我國所以處處落於人後。事事受制於人簡單言之。卽在產業之不發達耳。顧欲由產業落後之境地。一躍而進於產業發達之域。其事殊非易易要而言之。不外二途。（一）卽利用外資。（二）卽自力更生。然於今日而言利用外資。必將蒙不識時務之譏。蓋今日歐美各國。雖不無投資我國之意。然旣中梗於日本。則難免不逡巡却顧。裹足不前。至於日本方面。一則缺乏眞正投資之實力。二則其條件之能否不損我國主權。亦大有疑問故。今欲利用外資殊無希望唯一可循之途徑端在自力之更生也。</p>
<p>自力更生非僅消極的不借外債不利用外資之謂。且有積極的謀已國產業發展之義。而欲謀已國產業之發展。則除保育現有產業。促進其發榮滋長之生機外尙須籌措巨額資本。中國今日雖處於民窮財盡之地位。顧每年入超。猶年在五萬萬元以上。就本年上半年之數字觀之。亦在二萬八千六百萬元以上。設此鉅額之入超。而能儘數截留。或留其大部。則豈非極大之資本耶。再以此鉅額之資本。純粹用之於生產工具之購入。則純粹之自力更生。自非不可能之事。蘇聯七八年來建設之驚人。可資參證。蘇聯革命而後。物力蕩然資本短少。不在我國今日境况之上。外人投資之裹足不前。亦大類於我國目前之情狀。其一二屆五年計劃之猛進。直可謂爲白手成家。以彼例此。則我國苟有自力更生之决心。何患乎不能成爲事實也。</p>
<p>至於如何始能謀對外貿易入超之制止。盡民族工業保育之功能。則自以統制貿易爲不二法門。而統制貿易之關鍵。（一）在外匯之管理。（二）在保護關稅之建立。蓋外匯若能完全施以管理。則不必要之進口貨。於進口商人購買外匯時。卽可不予許可。而保護關稅建立之後。則幼穉之民族工業。卽能遂其發榮滋長之機能。我國財部自上月四日實施新貨幣制度之後。已能部分的管理匯兌。但所做到者。尙僅止於穩定匯兌。至於利用匯兌之控制權。進而平衡進出貿易之數量。則固尙未計議及之也。夫僅謀匯兌之穩定。而不進謀貿易之平衡。則爲支付國際貿易之入超計。仍有賴於白銀之輸出。加之。入超不已。白銀有限。欲圖國際匯兌之長久穩定。其勢必不可能。故利用對於外匯之管理權。進而謀輸入品之限制。實爲當今最迫切之要求。我人甚望當局百尺竿頭。再進一步。至於進口稅則之修改。亦爲當今必要之圖。此則可與外匯之控制。相爲呼應。卽奢侈品等類之進口稅。不妨高至値百抽百之程度。其他中國已能自製之商品。必須提高其進口稅率。限止其進口。卽使中國不能自製之商品。亦須問其是否必要。若非必要。則亦須高其關稅。俾難輸入。唯於中國不能自製之機器與工具。爲生產建設上不可或缺者。始可予以免稅之待遇。若能於此雙方並進。謀對外貿易之嚴格統制。則中國民族工業之發達。當可期日而待也。</p>
<p>我國爲農業國家。欲圖出超。尙談不到。我人所求者。無非入超之制止與减少。或節約不必要之輸入。而易以生產工具之輸入耳。至於外人方面對於此種統制。或不無多少阻梗。然長此不謀更張我國生機。不久卽有完全斬絕之一日。外人雖欲竭澤而漁。亦不可得。故凡眞正具有理智之外人。必能諒解我人之苦衷也。</p>

<p>— 張鈺哲</p>
<p>從前杞國有人憂天崩墜，以至於廢寢忘餐。經了人家一番解釋之後，心中才稍爲安定一些。我們現在總自以爲比古人聰明得多，又讀過列禦寇這篇大議論後，當然不再作此無謂之「杞憂」了。但最近各報紛紛登載了一段月亮將要墜到地球上來的新聞。據說還是某天文家發表的意見。這麼一來讀者恐怕也不能不相信了。</p>
<p>在這風聲鶴唳的當中，人事之外還加上一層天象的威嚇，實在是不幸得很，我們天文學者雖然沒有權力强迫學子回校上課，勒令市民停比搬家：但是也應當帮同闢謠，以盡國民天責。大家當然相信，假若月亮眞個地壓了下來，我們天文家自能替大家想辦法，不必自相驚擾。當着事來臨頭，固决不輕言犧牲，還是先作這初步的關謠工作罷。</p>
<p>就說月亮下墜的新聞，果是天文家的談話，而非報章上的傳聞，大家也無須乎過於認眞。其實除了日食月食春分秋分等等，天文家的預測也不見得比街頭算命先生高明許多。何以見得，有白香山的詩句爲證：</p>
<p>人事多端奚足怪，天文至信猶差忒。</p>
<p>月離於畢合滂沱，有時不雨誰能測。</p>
<p>爲着一般信古疑今的人們，我們更容易證明月亮下墜是毫不可怕的。張載西銘裏有乾稱父坤稱母的一語，可見地球實在是萬物之母，初不必向蟹行文學裏才可以找到M　other　Earth這個字眼。玉兎是月亮最普通的別名。顧名思義，那麽月亮下墜，我們若用白話詩的體裁去形容他，豈不是便可稱作一隻白兎投到母親懷裏去。這幡畫圖的神情是何等地溫柔慈愛。大家對此不但無須發生恐慌。要是相信禨祥的話還應認此爲可慶的吉兆。三國志裏吳夫人不是夢月入懷而生孫策嗎。鹿夢依稀尙且靈騐如此，若是眞個明月投懷，那麽應運而生的英雄，他的事業必定要遠勝於只能割據江東的孫策了。</p>
<p>談起坤稱母，地球做母親這句語，對於太陰而言，是再恰當也沒有了。人若不是上帝造的，就必定是由父母生的。日月星辰若不是上帝所創造，日月星辰也必定各有他們的父母。所不同的地方便是人類壽命，異常短促，我們可以上溯好幾個世代。日月星辰與人類壽命之比，遠不止五千歲爲春五千歲爲秋的大椿，和朝生幕死的蜉蝣並列。所以他們呱呱墜地的情狀，已經是龍罩在荒茫漂渺邃古的濃霧裏。但是根據天文的觀測，和數學物理原則的應用，還能找出一些蛛絲馬跡可以遵循。再要往上逐溯，天文數理的學者雖然不甘自認才盡，而聽者也就不免有墜入五里霧中之感。太陽系裏地球和其他行星產生的情形，在眼前二元學說是最佔勢力。除去了下等動物阿米巴是能够一而二二而四地分身，按着一元方法而繁殖；其他動物都必須藉父母的合作才能生產出來。太陽一家子專能够有這九個大行星，當年也必定和另一太陽，（便是恒星，）曾經萍踪偶聚而生露水姻緣。從現在太陽仍然劬育撫養這九個子女情形而看，太陽顯然是個不幸的棄婦。而那負心薄倖的薦子父星，大概又奔到銀漢深處，重組雙星，我們也無從再加追究。</p>
<p>天人之際究竟是有分別的。太陽臨蓐的情形，自別有一番偉大景象。日月的力量足以使地面海洋，掀起巨大的潮汐。當那碩大無朋的父星和太陽摩肩而過的時候，必然也有一種迪異尋常的生潮力最。加以太陽是一團熱烘烘的氣體，不像地球這般的冷靜穩重。所以那時太陽上面所激起的潮汐，簡直是一股奔騰碎湃的熱流，噴射到半空上去。這一股兩端瘦削腹部膨大的物質，受着那父星和太陽兩方吸力作用之下，便破碎而成這些行星，圍繞着太陽行動。同時行星在尙未凝固期間，受了其他行星和太陽吸力的影響，如法泡製地也生出許多衛星來。行星若是太陽之子女，衛星是便是太陽的小孫。不過天界的姓育方法，是生男抱孫同時舉行，這决非人世所能够企及的。</p>

<p>周小姐者，爲在野之李將軍甥女，方自美國鈹金歸來，服飾入時，舉止闊綽，所接近者且皆爲縉紳名流，以是芳譽鵲起，成爲交際之花矣，當李將軍在位時，今之紗廠大王，得其援助甚多，故紗廠大王之於李將軍，至今感其扶掖之恩，二人交情，乃至密切，旋周小姐倦勤歡場，欲謀一枝之棲，請於舅氏，李將軍卽設法使之爲紗廠大王之英文秘書，昨報所載振興紗廠總經理趙德雄自殺與交際花周縵麗小姐有關等語，據此案之實在情形，則周小姐僅爲趙德雄之花瓶，趙雖以周小姐之嫵媚動人，手腕靈活，竟爲所惑，而周小姐則不過虛與委蛇，並無愛情可言，乃自趙婿孫裕章入任振興紗廠顧問之後，與周小姐近水樓台，發生曖昧，此爲趙德雄所不知者，嗣德雄與女先後至縵麗寓所，與裕章相値，始察知隱秘，恍然大悟，但至於趙德雄之自殺主因，當亦不僅此一端也，蓋振興紗廠受環境壓迫，曾以廠屋向惠登銀行抵押，借重外資，力維危局，當趙德雄最後之孤注一擲，亦遭失敗以後，銀行買辦即逼簽讓渡廠屋契約，德雄受此重大襲擊，遂致瘋狂。</p>
<p>觀於上述情事，對於黄金女性鬥爭間之幻變，描摹生動，民族資本遭受國際資本之壓迫，亦有所闡明，若以此賓題材，編成電影劇本，殊足發人深省，可爲解剖工商業衰落原因之當頭棒喝，今藝華公司之有聲新片「時勢英雄」卽採用上項題材，益以種種技術上之進步，已無疑地成爲國產電影之傑搆，導演爲應雲衛先生，主角有胡萍尙冠武王乃東馬陋芬葉娟娟萬籟天諸大明星，日內卽將在金城大戱院正式公映，希各界人士特別注意。</p>

<p>— 金華亭</p>
<p>從這裏可以曉得硫酸在工業上的重要</p>
<p>（一）硫酸與工業之關係</p>
<p>硫酸為化學品之一，在工業上之用途頗廣，故硫酸一物，可稱為一切工業上之基礎。吾人欲知某一國家工業之發達與否，觀其每年需用硫酸數量之多少即得，我國昔日對化學一項，不甚注意，而硫酸自造，更不可能，迨近數年來，國人漸覺硫酸在工業與軍事之重要，乃力加研究，悉心仿製，然亦不過各處兵工廠內，附設小規模之硫酸廠，製造硫酸，以供各自在軍事上之應用而巳，其餘各項工業，因國內無大規模之硫酸廠，出產大量硫酸，仍不得巳購用外貨，根據二十一年之調查，國內各埠進口外貨硫酸之數量如下，九龍一八三六一擔，上海一二二〇三擔，天津七一六一担，膠州七一〇九担，大連二三四五担，其他各埠二三四五擔，查外國硫酸之市價，更無一定，全由外人操縱，就上海市價言，最高價値，每箱竟達十七兩以上，各用酸工廠，往往因原料成本過重，以致出品不能與外貨競爭，故近三五年中，國人更鑒於基本原料，受制於人，國內工業，萬難發達，乃在國內各地紛紛創設造酸廠，以期達到自造自給之目的，截至現在止，國內設立造酸廠者，（完全國人之資本）計有八處，雖不能與東西各國並駕齊驅，然巳較前進步多多矣。</p>
<p>（二）開成酸廠規模宏大</p>
<p>開成造酸公司之同仁，亦因鑒於硫酸一物，與並未及軍事上有莫大之關係，同時又以國內無大規模造酸廠，以致各項工業所用之硫酸，不得巳採用外貨，每年流出現金，為數可驚，為發達國內工業計，為挽回外溢權利計，乃集巨資八十七萬二千元，於民國二十年九月，組織成立開成造酸公司，開始籌備建築工廠，於二十一年一月，在殷行軍工路黃浦江畔動工，詎知開工未久，而一二八之事變暴發，不得巳停工五閱月之久，至同年六月終始能繼續建築，翌年一月底定工，該廠當局特定於一月二十八日開工製造，乃富有自惕不忘之意也，該廠地基，共計有四十六畝半之多，全廠共有燃礦爐三十只，（現僅開十八只）規模宏大，設備完全，為國內最大之造酸廠，當該廠創辦時，先行製造硫酸，次第推廣製造硝·鹽·醋酸·等無機及有機酸，數年來慘淡經營，始將硫酸工廠，全部完成，鐵廠出品，計有六十六度濃酸·五十八度塔酸·及四十八度寳酸三種，自出貨以來，經國內各工廠試用，均認為滿意，同時外貨亦即從此不能冉行操縱市塲，向昔每箱市價十七兩，現巳跌至十兩以內，觀乎此，吾人不慮外貨之充塞，但求國產之能發達者，惟製酸之主要原料為硫化鐵礦，國內雖有數處生產，但試用結果，成績未能圓滿，故該廠現在所用之硫化鐵礦，除一部分採用湖南水口山者，其餘均購自西班牙，查西班牙礦石，每噸市價三十二元，水口山礦石每噸二十八元，該廠鉛房，每日出品約十六噸，用礦石每日約七噸，鉛數平均每月約十三噸，硝酸原用智利硝，自下月起，改用本埠天利淡氣廠硝酸，銷路遍全國，營業頗廣。</p>
<p>（三）硫酸之造法與用途</p>
<p>甲，硫酸製造法硫酸之製造方法有兩種，（一）鉛室法，（Chamber　Process）（二）接觸法，（Contael　Process）該廠因國內市塲，稀硫酸（即淡硫酸）需用較多，故採用鉛室法，其製造程序簡述如下，先將硫化鐵礦石，用人工捶成一吋左右之小塊，然後置入燃礦爐燃燒，燃礦爐之發火，僅最初開工時，須用一次焦煤，將燃礦爐燒熱，以後礦石燃燒時所發生之化學反應熱，足够維持燃礦爐之熱度，不須再行加煤，將礦石放入燒熱之爐內，因其中含硫磺質甚豐即起燃燒，與空氣中之氣氣化合，成為二氣化硫氣體，為第一步工程，此種熱氣體及空氣，由爐頂之烟道導入硝石爐，將爐中鍋內之硫酸及硝石蒸溜，使發生硝酸氣體，為第二步工程，七述之混合氣體中，尙含有灰塵，故須通入除專室除去之，為第三步工程，經除塵室除塵後，由烟道通入第一給塔，同時由塔頂噴下含硝稀酸細霧，使一部分之二氣化硫及硝酸變成硫酸及亞硝酸氣，為第四步工程，塔中變成之硫酸，由塔底之放酸管放去，謂之塔酸，其比重在步梅比重表五十八度左右，此項塔酸，即該公司在市上發售之五十八度稀硫酸，在塔中未及化成硫酸之二氣化硫及亞硝酸氣，順次入第一第二第三鉛室，由各室頂上，噴下淸水細霧，使悉變成稀硫酸，為第五步工程，鉛室生成之稀硫酸，謂之室酸，其比重：第一鉛室酸，在步梅表五十二度左右，第二鉛室酸，約在四十九度，第三鉛室中生成之室酸，混合配成，經過鉛室之餘氣，再由通氣管，順次通入第二第三鉛塔，由塔頂噴下稀硫酸細霧，吸收餘氣中之亞硝酸，所得之含硝稀硫酸，由塔底放酸管，放入貯酸桶，有由耐酸豐浦，打回第一鉛塔頂上，噴入第一鉛塔中，使其所吸收之亞硝酸氣，再由鉛塔而入各鉛室，如是由些三鉛塔之交換作用，可使亞硝酸氣，常在三鉛室中循環，僅小部分之損失，由硝石爐所發生之硝酸氣補充之。即該公司在市上所發售之硫酸，計有四十八度稀硫酸，五十八度稀硫酸，六十六度濃硫酸三種，所謂濃硫酸，即將室酸或塔酸加熱燒濃，比之稀硫酸，並無差異，不過含水多寡不同耳。</p>
<p>乙，硫酸之用途硫酸旣有稀濃兩種之分，則其用途亦有同異之處，查硫酸之用途，非常廣汎，幾乎無論何種工業，莫不需用硫酸，茲述其主要用途如後：</p>
<p>（一）稀硫酸用途　稀硫酸最大用途，為製造過燐酸石灰及硫酸錏等人造肥料，幾占全部用途十分之八，此外，主要用途，為製造芒硝，（即兀明粉）純碱，燒碱，硫化鈉，漂白粉，燐，碘，及溴，等化學工業原料及藥品，亞硫酸，鹽酸，硝酸，氟氫酸，硼酸，炭酸，鉻酸，草酸，酒石酸，枸櫞酸，及醋酸，等無機酸及有機酸，鉀，鋇，鈣，鎂，鉛，鐵，鋅，銅，及水銀，等硫酸鹽之原料，又於製鍊銅，鉛，鎳，白金，及銀，等金屬材料，製作電池，精製礦油，製糖，及澱粉，製造有機色素，製造羊皮紙，製造汽水，搪瓷，染色，及鍍金，等工業，稀酸亦為主要之原料，更有在各種工業方面作沉澱劑，中和劑，費化劑，及化學分析用等。</p>
<p>（二）濃硫酸用途　濃硫酸之用途，雖不及稀硫酸之廣，而其數量亦頗大，約及稀硫酸之半，其最重要之用途，為製造脂肪酸，濃硝酸，以脫，有機物，之硫礦酸，顏料，火藥，炸藥，人造絲，及養璐珞，等之原料，此外尙有製造火油，精製邦辣粉，及各種礦油，精製金銀，分別銅銀，及吸取空氣中之濕氣等，至於製造硫酸原料，為一，硝酸，二，硫化鐵礦，三，空氣等三種。</p>
<p>又該廠購用之西班牙礦石中，約含有砒素千分之三，故所出四十八度稀酸中，約含萬分之五亞砒酸，對於電池，製造酒石酸，枸櫞酸，汽水，澱粉，及糖等工業，並不合用，乃特設除裝置兩套，藉以製造四十八度除砒稀酸，以備上述各廠之用。</p>
<p>（四）我國製酸量與各國</p>
<p>我國在近數年中創設之製酸廠，計有廣東，廣西，四川，河南，漢陽，山西，天津，及上海，等八處，每日產量，最大者上海開成及河南山西日出十五噸，最小者天津利中公司，日出五噸，其餘均在十噸左右，每年總產量約二九五二〇〇噸，再查世界各國每年之產酸量，日本一百萬噸，美國四百萬噸，俄國七十萬噸，英，德，法，均為一百三十萬噸，根據此項數量之比例，無怪我國工業少所以落後也。</p>
<p>記者於日前往開成造酸廠參觀時承林大中，方履熙，兩君親自引導參觀，並對造酸方法及用途，詳加說明，至為感謝，查林君係東京帝大工科火藥學系畢業，歸國後，在漢陽兵工廠七年，上海兵工廠四年，二十一年後始主持開成造酸廠，方君係日本福岡工專畢業，現在該廠任技師。</p>

<p>我一直在放進去，可是它偏不會滿起來，我眞倦呀，羅勃說道，同時停下來去一息他的一雙短腿，開始覺得摘莓實確不是如他想像的那麽有趣；因為太陽高懸着，還有餘威可灼，南恩跳來跳去像一個蚱蜢，莓實剛放進了他的手桶，便又從桶裏翻了出來，因為他知短叢樹掙扎時，這手桶常常會翻身的。</p>
<p>「上一次我們來時牆的那一邊結的莓實才多哩，—而且是頂刮刮大的；那邊還有一個洞，童子們在那裏生了一個火‘我們過去，好老早將手桶袋滿，然後去藏在同裏，讓也們來戈尋我們罷」，南恩建議道，她對於新奇的冒險行為，巳是躍躍欲試了。</p>
<p>羅勃表示贊成，一溜烟他們去了，爬過了那垜牆，順着那一邊斜坡的田地一直跑下去，直到他們深入了磐石堆和矮樹　裏。莓實纍纍至茂密，所以後來那些手桶畢竟巳盛滿了，那邊地旣幽蔭，且又凉爽，一個小小的流泉從它積苔的蓋上給這兩個苦渴的孩子以淸沁脾胃的暢飲。</p>

<h3 id="c199">實行米榖平均販賣的研討 <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— 李寅北</p>
<p>一　內地糧食貿易之　查</p>
<p>「榖賤傷農，榖貴害民。」　　今古一句　可　　的明訓了。到目前，糧食的價格，時忽高漲，時忽降落；相　相　，成為今日一個極嚴重的社會問題。雖然糧食價格的漲落，與年來的洋米問題，災荒問題，以及政治問題，固有息息相關的牽連；但是內地各處糧食盈虧的未能調劑。要亦不失為一個重要的因素。像前數年，滿地的麥子充作燃料，而某地的農村飢人相食？其實中國整個的民食問題，向來是沒有注意到調整的方法。比如某處地方是向來糧食不足的，那末不足的數量是多少，調整的方法是怎樣去着手；某處地方糧食的數量是過剩的，那末糧食剩餘的數量是多少，用什麼方法將糧食輸送到缺乏的地方去。全國糧食的生產，是否能與全國人口的消費量足以平衡；假使全國糧食生產量是不足全國人口的消費，那末不足的糧食，應當用什麼方法來調劑；反之假使糧食的生產量有過剩，那末如何替糧食找求出路。務使逢到糧食過剩的時候，不至於榖賤傷農。糧食不足的時候，不至於榖貴害民。但是欲達此目的，非整個中國實行糧食的（平均販賣）是辦不到的。要是實行糧食平均販賣，必須先從內地糧食的盈虧問題着手；要明瞭內地糧食的盈虧情形，又非從調查方面入手不可了。因為調查之後，始可由數字上表示出內地糧食盈虧程度來。此次農村復興委員會本此志旨，特地委托上海的社會經濟調查所從事於上海，南京，江西，蕪湖，無錫等地作糧食的調查工作。但是在方法上沒有到內地來調查過的時候，總認為是處處相同的。並且認為相同的程度，是以上海調查時所施行的方法為規範。其實這是不對的。適用於甲地的方法，並不見得再能適用於乙地；適用於此時的方法，並不見得再能適用於彼時。上海的民食組織　是不同於無錫；更不能視南京亦為一例。於是　抱着極大希望，身入內地來調查糧食上的盈虧　　因為沒有注意到方法上的時間與空間上　　有失望而了事的。為了這個方法問題　　　以牽制整個的糧食調查工作。因此我們將　見所及，把它敘述在下面。</p>
<p>二　搜集資料的方法</p>
<p>我們調查糧食盈虧最關重要的泉源；向來是仰賴於交通機關的相與合作。歸納言之，發生糧食問題盈虧資料的地方，是有下列數處：</p>
<p>（一）海關報告冊</p>
<p>（二）鐵道貨運記載</p>
<p>（三）公路貨運記載</p>
<p>（四）各地轉運業賬冊</p>
<p>（五）內河輪運業賬冊</p>
<p>（六）各縣船行業運貨憑單</p>
<p>以上六方面的材料；目前所能搜集到手的，僅有海關報告和鐵道運輸記載二種。至於公路貨運業務，亦屬不甚重要；至若轉運業，內河輪運業，以及各縣的船行業的運輸材料；根本尚沒有搜集到手。在上海方面，關於糧食貿易的調查工作；大抵多側重於海關報告冊和鐵道貨運記載，再相乘上海全市市民的人口總和；藉以估計糧食的盈虧情形。但是這種調查方法，只能適用於全國糧食集散中心的上海；於內地是不適用的。在內地調查糧食唯一的方法，祗有從各地的糧食貿易情形和人口調查入手。內中關於人口問題，目前可以利用內地的保甲編查，向行政官署接洽；縱然得到的材料不能云確實詳盡；但其中決不致有大出入的。所難者，即在內地糧食貿易的調查，事前應該如何去着手。</p>
<p>我們認為內地糧食盈虧最關重要的問題，當然是某地在每年糧食的輸入是多少。關於此種資料主要的泉源，便是某地的糧食行家與其他經營糧食交易的機關；描寫這種糧食行家與經營糧食交易機關每年糧食貿易的具體代表；便是賬冊。而尤關重要的，當然是「貨源」帳。因為內地糧食的輸入，向來是分為「鄉貨」與「客貨」二種。「鄉貨」是足以地糧食生產的盈虧情形；「客貨」是足以代表某地糧食運銷的盈虧情節。舉凡二種糧貨輸入某地的數量，統統都登記入貨源賬裏面。且照統計學上材料來源的研究：「貨源」賬可列入「原始材料」Drimary　Materiasl的一種；其真確性較任何資料為可靠。</p>
<p>但是糧食商人的心理，往往帶有神秘與不可捉摸的態度。關於此類帳冊，總是不肯輕易示人的。第一是因為營業上的關係，確乎有嚴守秘密的必要。其次是因為政治上的租稅問題，已經失掉糧食商人的信仰；對於賬冊的保守秘密，亦有相當的成分。像此次社會經濟調查所在無錫調查糧食的情形，徧徧會逢到小麥營業稅的征收問題相持不決。在這種草木皆兵的空氣中，調查人員要搜集一些糧食每年總輸入的估計，成為「十叩柴扉九不開」的地步。假使要想搜集糧食行家的帳冊；簡直是個夢想。恐怕此種教訓，在調查人員深印未忘吧。雖然調查是調查，與營業稅問題毫沒有關涉，但是糧食商人的心理，我們是知道的；是為了過去數次納稅的教訓，未免有些「杯弓蛇影」了，糧食行家愛莫能助的苦衷，是件不必去掩飾的事實。</p>
<p>至於補救的辦法，不是說絕對沒有；不過在目前政府的信用尚未能樹建到民間去之前；我們認為調查人員須自己來協助自己。下面四個建議，便是調查人員應有的精神工具。</p>
<p>（甲）調查人員須申明調查的立塲　我們在沒有入手調查之前，申明調查的立塲是一件應該做到的開塲工作。往往有好許多調查人員，對於這一步應該申明的開頭工作，　九是忽略的；即使申明，也是含含糊糊的未能澈底申明，於是乎糧食行家遇到是調查人員到來，因為不能明瞭他的來路；懷欵的謎津，不能打消。狡黠者，敷衍了事；遷塞者，閉門不納。結果不虛不實的材料，從東湊西拼中去向上搪塞其職責。因此我們對於申明立塲問題，是不能忽略的。比如我們是行政機關直轄的調查人員，應當說明此次調查的目的是什麼；如果對於糧食行家有利益的地方，務使糧食行家相信此種利益是可能的，不是欺騙的。倘使逢到糧食行家有苦衷的申訴，應該掬誠接受；最好追溯苦痛的所由，籌解除苦痛的辦法來安慰它。</p>
<p>（乙）以政治力量　着眼藉輿論手段為入手　過去的調查人員，都忽視了這一道的調查門徑。試觀一批調查人員到一個地方；不是用一件公函來請當地的行政官署協助，就是在事前先行呈請了某地行政官署的主管機關，請求行一個訓令到某地的行政官署裏面去幫助。這種手段都是用行政力量來作主體的，在現代的民間，已是不適用的了。且行政的力量，未必能適用於我們的經濟調查工作；或者大綱的報告，可以辦到；要是有精密可靠的統計，恐怕還非行政機關所能做到的事情。我們認為最好的辦法，還是從聯絡內地的輿論機關入手；請他們作為我們的調查工具。我們試就事理而論：輿論是一個在天天代表民眾講話與天天和民眾接近談話的發聲器；比較一件公函或者一個訓令的機能，在精神上是要健康得多。祗要輿論方面答允協助；任何問題，不難迎刃而解。</p>
<p>（丙）調查人員須具社會的教育化不可帶政治的官僚化　任何機關的調查人員，以調查此種經濟的糧食問題時；總應該以社會觀看教育手段為前提。因為我們調查的性質，是側重於研究以備咨詢的；并不是管理或執行的，從性質上的區分，我們只應該運用民食教育的手段，而絕對不能絲毫含有官僚的成分。即就調查的效力上論，亦以前者佔優勝。</p>
<p>（丁）調查問題注重綱目放棄枝節　我們老實說一句：能夠主持調查工作的人員，大多是經過科學思想訓練的。每一問題，都可以用演繹的方式布列成蛛綱似的疑問線。此種疑問線應用到同等程度的階段裏去，是不難可以得到滿意的答案。但是內地糧食行家的代表人，是舊式商人。不是新智識份子。能夠受過科學思想訓練的，固然也有；但是就大體而論，舊式商人總佔多數，所以糧食調查人員的疑問線過於複雜，他們非但不能作答；反且覺得厭煩了。由此測騐，調查人員與糧食行家的代表人討論問題，以具體的綱目的主體；不重要的問題，最好不談。</p>
<p>上面四種辦法，在運用時尚須酌量內地的社會情形而變通。假使能照此種原則做去，定然可以水到渠成。總之我們誰都知道：全國農村的總破產，任何都有責任與利害的關連；調查糧食盈虧的目的，在要復興農村來繁榮都市。內地糧食商人所以不願意將貿易情形推誠報告我們的因素，并不是不贊助共同復興農村；為怕和盤托也了之後，對他自身有不利的畏懼。其中尤涉嫌疑的迷津，便是租稅問題，至此，調查人員祗有在政治信用尚取得民間信任之前，自當以不欺騙的手段為立塲；注重上述四種原則來自己訓練自己。希望我們的調查人員，從此遵為調查工作的座右銘。</p>
<p>三　米榖平均販賣的重要</p>
<p>米榖為我國人民生活上必要的消費品。年來為了天災人禍，交相為患；宜稻之區，面積日縮。若據國府主計處統計局的估計：我國每年產米為六一·一一三·七八〇·〇〇〇斤，僅足供國民一九一·六〇〇·〇〇〇人的食用；（見社會經濟月報二卷三期四八頁）如果此項數字是可靠的，則尚有二萬萬餘人的糧食無從取給。不消說，這並不是真的無從取給，不過取給的米榖，非中國自己農田所生產者而已。至於這個米榖恐慌程度是如何深刻，祗須從歷年來的洋米進口數字上，便可窺測其一斑。</p>
<p>我們如果要從米榖問題上加以着想；那末只有從（一）擴展耕地的面積，（二）改善農事的技術　和（三）實施平均販賣等的手段上可以擺脫這個束縛。但是在第一點　　；　美國的　　　氏　　　之估計，恐怕中國在此短時間內，無甚希望的。理由是因為中國全部土地，具有可耕性的農地，僅占百分之二十九；其餘百分之七十的土地，有的是因為氣候乾燥，雨是缺乏；有的是因為山林　壑地土磽　；還有許多很好的良田美地，往往多被封建社會的瑩墓所侵佔，使良好的土地不能利用。由此推論，擴展土地面積，固然是可以增加米榖的產量；但是在短時期內恐怕未能實現的，在等二點方面；確實是　增加米榖生產的經濟方法，但是因為不是本文所論述的對象，便是第三點所舉列的實施平均　　；在未討論這個問題以前，應當先明瞭平均販賣是什麼工作。簡單的說：平均販運是包含兩個意義；一個是消費者實行「平均分配」另一個是生產者實行「共同販運」。要之，此種米榖平均販賣果真能夠實行，至低限度，可以消弭交易行為上「利己致富」的觀念。現在將我國已具雛形的平均販賣制度，列舉幾個，用以檢討。</p>
<p>（一）販賣合作社　販賣合作社，是平均販賣制度下「共同販賣」的基座；佔整個平均販賣業務上的一段。其業務，為由農民手中生產出來的米榖，委托合作社代為販賣。販賣合作社的宗旨，雖然想不經米業中間人的手，直接去售與消費者；但是商業社會中都市方面的潛勢力，是重重屏障着；想藉一個販賣合作社的組織，來深入都市，那真是所謂「孤掌難鳴」了。</p>
<p>（二）農業倉庫　倉庫雖然不是實施平均販賣的執行機關；而卻是一個扶助平均販賣的重要組織。在米榖的消費者方面，是可以協助消費者「平均分配」；在米榖的生產者方面，是可以協助生產者「共同販賣」。但是目下的倉庫，並不是米榖消費者或米榖生產者直接所經營；大多數的倉庫，不是替米榖做儲棧；就是替銀行做賬房。</p>
<p>（三）米榖販賣統制　米榖販賣統制，即系米榖平均販賣的政策。易言之。就是統制經濟的一種；本來統制經濟，是最新式的經濟政策，各國採行的亦已不少。關於米榖販賣統制的目：第一步是管理米業中間人訂購國外的米榖，使全國米榖的價格，不致因洋米的過度輸入而榖賤傷農。第二步是統計國內的米榖消費量和生產量，用政治的力量予以調劑；並且按照農事季節的情形，規定米榖的價格；使經營米榖業務的中間人，不得任意操縱市面。第三步在全國重要的米榖集散地，建築極大的倉庫，用以儲藏該地剩餘的米榖；云調劑米榖缺乏地方的糧食。此種辦法果真能切實實行，米榖平均販賣的目的，或許可以達到。但是我國目前此種販賣統制尚沒有實現；在去年，中央要想組織而未成功的八省糧食運銷局，便是米榖平均販賣統制方法的一種。</p>
<p>四　結論</p>
<p>總而言之：米榖平均販賣的意義，無非要使生產經濟與消費經濟切實合作的具體表現。我們在上面敘述的三種方法中：發現平均販賣的條件是有四個：</p>
<p>第一是米榖的保管條件；查米榖的本身，本來是件費人管理的東西；在米榖平均販賣實行後，將由農民的各別儲藏改為共同的集中儲藏。邦末集中儲藏與各別儲藏的保管設備上，則大不相同了。舉凡保管問題上的通風設備，防濕設備，防蟲設備，防鼠設備，在在有時加注意的必要；否則偶一疏忽，則貽害整個的販賣制度，良非淺鮮！第二是米榖加工調製的條件：舉凡磨　糧米，均須有相當的注意。第三是米榖的運銷條件；第四是米榖的金融條件。</p>
<p>在販賣合作社的組織之下，對於米榖的保管及加工調製；因為合作社的財力枯窘，總是因陋就簡的敷衍了事。於運銷條件，也枝枝節節的不能做到；就是金融條件，也難真真達到農業金融條件的原理。其次在倉庫制度的組織之下，雖然在保管與加工調製上，勉強可以做到；但是離開完完善善的倉庫原理上，尚屬甚遠；據農村復興委員會會報的記載，在江蘇浙江安徽三省所設立的倉庫中，其能符合倉庫原理的，僅有江蘇無錫的東亭倉庫一所；餘有的倉庫，多於開辦時為要節省經費起見，均以租賃民房，宗嗣及廟宇者為多。論到此種租賃的建築物，本來已是年久失修；關於米榖的安全問題，大多危險堪虞！至於運銷條件，雖然是沒有做到：但是實際上他們也無從去做到。即就金融條件而論：沒有一個倉庫不是採取「儲即是押」的態度；因此儲押不分，米榖那裏去談得到平均販賣呢？米榖的販賣統制是怎樣；因為我們尚沒有見到糧食運銷局開張營業；所在此地還無從去預測。</p>
<p>末了，我們認為此種漫無系統的平均販賣；在方法上是不對的。假使長此以往，非特不能走到平均販賣的目的；反且是以擾亂民食組織的秩序。今後的補救。唯有切切實實的從「官」與「民」兩方面協合趕來　在政府方面，須即日成立米榖平均販賣委員會，或者全國糧食運銷局；以節制洋米進口，統計各省米榖盈虧，管理全國農業倉庫，與登記全國的　坊，輾米廠，私人經營的輾米機，及其他關於米榖的加工事宜：舉凡關於釀酒製糖，亦須在限制之例。在民眾方面；須切實仰承政府平均販賣的統制政策，組織販賣合作社與消費合作社，承上接下，一致合作；那末此種平均販賣的目的　幾可以真真的達到。</p>
<h3 id="c200">推進農村副業談 <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— 季君</p>
<p>近年以來，農村副業頗為一般人所注重，提倡推進，復不遺餘力。但是推進農村副業，表面上似乎是很簡單的，而實際上並不是簡單的。</p>
<p>推進副業之先決問題，要認清基本原則，而後才談到推進之方法和步驟，茲請詳言之。</p>
<p>甲，推進副業的基本原則</p>
<p>（一）適應環境　依各地之環境，出產之材料，而定推進副業之標準，如出　之地，當推進製蓆之業，產桑之地，自應注意育蠶製織綢製絲綿等業務。年齡之壯幼，體力之強弱，亦能影響於推進副業之種類。</p>
<p>（二）不妨礙主業　提副業，應不礙主業為原則。</p>
<p>（三）減輕成本事業輕便　成本輕，農人始有力担負，且出售亦易。事業輕便，不需多少工具，不占地積，使農村中之男婦小女，都可隨時隨地工作，如占地較多。或生財要多的事業，恐難作普遍之推進。</p>
<p>（四）利用原料　盡量利用各地原有之原料，最好利用主業所出產之副產品，如產麥之區，即推進製作　鞭；這樣，原料旣能普遍，又不必多花成本，則副業自會向發達的路上走去，不然，即有好的計劃，而當地缺乏原料，向外方去購買，成本旣大，獲利自微，推進副業，即感困難。且將當地原料，棄置之，亦殊可惜！</p>
<p>（五）設法推廣銷路　有時雖有精良的出品，但因消費者少，或者不曾推行到遠地去，致行銷不易，遂影響到事業的不掁。故有了大批產品以後，除供本地消費以外，就應向外推銷；出品暢銷，在商業上有了地位，則那一項副業自然會發達的。</p>
<p>（六）出品精良　要出品精良，首先選用好原料，製造歸真，和改進製造的方法。舉例來說：江蘇之通崇海如啟各縣棉區，向以織布為副業，出產的大布很多；但現因市塲及消費者之需要不同，粗布阻滯，我們推廣這裏的副業時，就應當使他們改用細紗，織合市塲銷售之布，以期暢銷。</p>
<p>（七）改良運銷　多數農家副業之產品，仍由商人操縱，不得善價而沽，致事業方面，大受影響，最好組織運銷合作社，由生產者直接出售，不經過中間人之手。同時改良裝運和貯藏的方法，以便運輸遠方，沒有損失，在果品及蛋類，尤不可忽此。</p>
<p>乙，實施推進之程序</p>
<p>推進副業之程序，首應調查，依調查之結果，劃分副業之區域；并兼重各種副業在市塲上的狀況，以作推進事業之參考。次則整理原有之副業，蓋原有事業，有較長之歷史，農村居民，對於技巧和情形，都有些經騐和訓練，我們祇要整理之或改善之，自能發達；在這一方面有了基礎，我們再選擇一二種最合環境之副業提倡推進之。話雖如此，如原有副業，實在不足以維持時，我們亦不必一層不變地引進新事業，以代替原有之副業。總之：我們要注意現實，而不可抹煞現實。</p>
<p>以上所述，不過僅其大槪，詳細方法，因事業而不同——如屬於工業方面的副業，是一種推進的方法；屬於農業方面的副業，又是另一種推進的方法——因地而有異，在乎負起推進農村副業責任者，適時隨事，酌定之；本文亦不多贅言矣！</p>

<p>— 沈兆荃醫師</p>
<p>咳嗽·為氣道之反對運動。常深吸息之後。氣道以反對之運動。一旦來急劇之痰攀性呼息。開其巳閉之聲門。此時所發之一種聲音。曰咳嗽。强健之人。大抵山吸受强烈之氣。或感冒寒氣。或煙塵等刺戟氣管。咽頭而發。然如耳道·舌根·若受刺戟。亦發咳嗽。病之來也。大都基於喘息·氣管枝炎·爛喉痧·肺癆·肺氣腫·百日咳·咽頭炎·氣道潰瘍·喉頭小腫瘍諸症·此外則由於種種呼吸器病。當人咳嗽之時·全身靜脈之環流。立起障害。故額面·頸項·靜脈怒張。縷縷靑筋·分明發現。面靑而紅。此種現象。可實徵之。又有因氣壓上肺而患肺氣腫者。</p>
<p>尋常咳嗽。無不有痰咯出。其單有咳而無痰者。則謂之乾咳。如因耳道刺戟喉頭炎·氣管支炎·百日咳諸症。皆足致之。健康之人。必因煙塵等衝入氣道。始發咳嗽。若呼吸器有病。則稍吸入寒氣。或稍含塵埃之空氣。亦遽發咳嗽。但亦有不同者。倘病者巳人事不省。或喉頭·氣管枝早巳麻痺。或氣管校炎日久。呼吸筋力弱。（如筋肉不甚發達之小兒·或因熱病而呼吸筋衰弱之人）·雖具有咳嗽之原因。亦不易發也。</p>
<p>痰之性質。雖有數種。要不外粘液·膿球·上皮等質。間有含血球·强力織維·結核菌者。則惟在某種病症為然。</p>
<p>咳嗽雖至輕微。必須立刻醫治。苟視若等閒。不難立致重症。如肺炎。肺癆等是。諺云：「傷風不醒變成癆」。顧可輕忽之耶。故當以速行療治為是。</p>
<p>凡患傷風咳嗽至三星期以上者。必當疑為肺癆。更宜早期求醫。切勿放任不治。</p>
<p>咳嗽之療法。雖視原因為標準。但皆以被痰鎭咳為目的。通常以Tr．Ipeacae，Tr．Senega　Ammonia　Chlorate　Tolu　Balsam，Codien等為最習用。故市上販售之止咳片及止咳糖漿。皆不外由上列各藥所製成。效力甚微。且易傷害食慾。故久用不甚合宜。</p>
<p>余近來診治咳嗽·喘息·氣急等症。均用「肺活」，Phith　Weal一藥。奏效迅速。確能駕於一切治咳藥劑之上。且藥味甘美。婦孺易服。久用幷無傷害食慾之弊。凡老年痰飲咳嗽肺癆咳嗽·傷風咳嗽等一切咳症。服此藥均可當日見效。指日痊愈。且服用「肺活」者。有增進健康預防肺癆之功。如身體虛損。肺弱痰多者。更宜服之。</p>

<p>— 姜冠羣醫師</p>
<p>營養之良否。與肺病患者病勢之進展。頗有關係。然營養不良。則身體瘦弱。體重因而減退。病勢之增惡遂愈加速。反是。則營養佳良。身漸肥滿。體重因而增加。則病勢日漸輕快。故欲明肺結核之病狀。往往視身體之肥瘦重輕。以定病勢之進退。是以營養佳良。體重增加。為肺病療養之基礎。</p>
<p>欲使營養佳良。宜多食滋養豐富而且極易消化之食物。如鳥獸魚肉牛乳鷄卵等動物性食品。或米麥豆蔬菜等之植物性食物。但不可偏於一方。應當動植物兩種混食之。所食之物。宜兼及數種。不可單食一物。蓋身體之營養。須各種滋養原質（卽蛋白質。脂肪。含水炭素。維他命等）。調和適宜。不論何種滋養食料。斷無一品之中。而包含各種原質者。故吾人如每日專食一種食物。各原質必有過多或不及之弊。欲營養之平衡。乃為至難之事。况人之素性。雖極佳之食物。若每日食之。久必生厭。且至食慾减少。故結核病療養中之食料。須種種混合食之為要。</p>
<p>健全胃腸。為肺病治療之唯一基礎。所以欲達營養佳良之目的。首要使胃腸健全。蓋胃腸之健否。能直接影響於食慾之增减。凡食物入口須反覆咀嚼。待唾液混合後。方可嚥下。若飲食過速。不及細細咀嚼而嚥下。則消化力卽不完全。致滋養料吸收于體中之量减少。而减其滋養之價値。此種狀况。若持續常久。則消化器不免疲勞。因之誘起消化不良。營養不足之患。此處應重申言者。治愈結核之秘訣。因在於使體力旺盛。以壓倒結核菌。按肺病患者之吸收能力。巳甚薄弱。營養狀態。當然不良。於是。欲其攝取多量食品。而不能消化和吸收。反致促成胃腸等疾病。豈非弄巧成拙。</p>
<p>人體所需之營養成分。以蛋白質為最大。含水炭素及脂肪次之。至於其他無機鹽類及維他命之類。所需至微。除蛋白質外。其餘皆在日常攝取之食物品中。儘足吸收應用。因其消化工作簡單。於普通食物中。能得相當之補充。惟蛋白質一種。則非經過最費力最複雜之消化。不能得到。故肺病患者本屬胃腸薄弱之人。其欲於日常食物之中。而欲求蛋白質之補充。不亦難乎。</p>
<p>由此觀之肺病患者不得不於普通食品以外。尋求蛋白質之補給。而考諸市上販售之所謂强壯劑者。則却與此相反。大都只含少許燐砒·鐵鈣，規雖碘·之類。於實際上簡直無所進出有時反使用者之胃腸受害。增加病勢。而妨礙治愈。肺病患者購用滋養强壯劑時。可不深加注意耶。</p>
<p>近有「康氏生活素」Conbour's　Sanvita-Cell者。卽以動物性蛋白質為原料。利用酵素作用。經人工完全消化而製成。含有各種重要「阿米諾酸」Amino　Acid服用以後。無須消化器之消化。而直接滋養人體。製造血液。構成肌肉。同時鼓勵細胞。以促進新陳代謝。而使全身精神煥發。增進消化液之分泌。以助食物消化。又如對於疾病抵抗。腦力生長。活動生殖器等。均有密切之關係。肺病患者。因結核毒素之作用，體內蛋白質必被强度分解破壞。而服用本品以補充蛋白質之不足。極為適當。且本品用於結核病人。因能增進營養。而其自然治愈力與抵抗力。亦頗增强。故為肺病治療之要藥。服此藥能事半功倍。本輕利重為計之得。無過於此也。</p>
<p>余臨診肺病數載。向以「康氏生活素」Conbour’Ssa　-Vita　Cell及「肺活」Phith　Weal二樂。令病者同時內服。幷囑其實行安靜。空氣。日光等天然療養。衣食住嚴加注意。所得病家之報告。不下數百餘人。皆稱成續美滿。由此以觀。「康氏生活素」Conour's　San-Vita-Cell之用於肺癆病。可增進改善其營養狀態。旺盛其自然治愈之機能。不啻一肺病根治藥也。</p>
<h3 id="c212">神經衰弱講坐　家庭幸福的破壞者生殖器機能障礙 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— （沈香伯醫師）</p>
<p>陰萎之原因及療法</p>
<p>俗稱腎虧的生殖器障礙——陰萎。是一種範圍極廣的特別症候。這種症候。算是把性交的使命完全失去。因而不能生育。兩性間得不倒合歡之樂。因而釀成夫婦的不和。增加懊惱。因此之故。陰萎可以說是家庭幸福的破壞者。</p>
<p>陰萎的原因很多。大概分為生殖器的疾患與反常的——勃起中樞興奮性之缺乏的——反射之精神的障礙的三種。今分述於左。</p>
<p>（一）生殖器疾患和反常的陰萎。她的症狀約有十數種。重的。是器質的陰萎。如生殖器之畸形。包莖·缺損·與發育不全等原因而得的。或是因陰莖附近的反常而發生的。但是這一種的陰萎。依她的症候之程度。也不能說絕對的失去了生殖作用。</p>
<p>（二）勃起中樞興奮性之缺乏的陰萎。這是山勃起神經之障害而發生的。多半是性慾减退——也有完全消滅的。這是因為攝護腺部或尿道腺的慢性淋疾和徵毒·結核·腎臟病·脊髓炎·肥胖病等疾患。性的亢奮完全受了妨阻。失去了性慾中樞的刺戟而發生的陰萎。而酒·煙·鴉片。嗎啡。砒素等的中毒。也是原因。尤其是因手淫和性交過度。勃起和射精的中樞失了亢奮而發生的——這名呌麻庫性陰萎。</p>
<p>（三）反射作用之精神障害的陰萎。這是由於驚悸。苦慮。羞恥·激怒·恐怖等强度的精神感動而發生的。也有純眞的靑年。怕傳染徽毒。為一種的脅迫觀念所龔。因而成了陰萎的。還存埋頭於科學的發明者。把精神集中於某方面的結果。因而發生陰萎的。陰萎的原因。實在是多種多樣的。</p>
<p>陰萎的治療法。因為陰萎不是獨立的疾患。是有各種原因的。所以治療必先要治那假原因。大概言之。險萎是容易恢復的。根據我臨床上的經騐。治療陰萎的藥劑。最靈騐最有效的。是內分泌製劑的「還爾童」Well　Tonic為最可靠了。祇要按法服用。（一日三次，每次兩片·食前服之）無有不奏效的。不過在治療期內。也須嚴守攝生的規則。刺激性飲食物不可多吃。（如烟酒，咖啡·辣菽·葱蒜等）願吃牛乳·鷄卵·肉湯鷄汁魚肉等滋養豐富的食物。如是因為體質虧損和血液薄弱所起的陰萎。應服「還爾童」Well　Tonic另外。須兼用補血劑同時內服。補血藥以「康氏生活素」Conbour's　San-Vita-Cell為最好。他如避免身心過勞適當的運動。都要注意的。還有行冷水浴或是用冷水摩擦。也是補助治療好的方法。</p>
<h3 id="c213">肺病漫談 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 沈兆荃醫師</p>
<p>一　世無直接殺滅結核菌之藥劑</p>
<p>今日市上販售之療肺藥品。種類繁多。不勝枚舉。其再新聞紙雜誌上跨大如何特效者。一經臨床實騐。均歸泡影。殆暴露其全然無效。但世之肺病患者。因受其惑。以致坐誤正當治療之時期。而自陷於不救之人。正不知凡幾也。</p>
<p>按肺結核之病原。為結核桿菌。凡稍有科學常識者類多知之。此菌之抵抗力極為强大。任何藥劑。皆不易撲滅之。近世醫藥之進步雖速。而能直接殺滅癆菌之特效藥。尙未發明。吾人治療結核之原則。乃以增加人身之抵抗力。間接使疾病痊愈。幷不能直接殺菌也。</p>
<p>化學室內之試騐管中。能直接撲殺結核菌之藥劑雖多。然皆有猛烈之毒性。若將牠用於人體內。在撲滅結核菌之前。人體必先受莫大之損齊。况藥物。無論內服及注射。必須經過血管同血液循環全身到病灶方能發揮其效力。惟結核病灶在肺臟組織之一隅。幷無血管。故即使有安全殺菌之藥品。其效力亦無從發顯。換言之。病原菌繁殖之處。非藥劑所能達到者。故此等藥品之作用於體內結核菌之不可靠。可以知之矣。</p>
<p>二　用內分泌劑補助治療可縮短愈之過程</p>
<p>患肺結核之病人。多患神經裏弱。及體內新陳代謝之失調。因此抵抗力亦大為减弱。妨礙治愈。余在臨床上之經騐。對於肺病之治療。除一般的根本療法外。兼用內分泌製劑之「還爾童」Wlle　Tonic令病者內服。（本品係動物之靑春腺中提出之精液所製）服至十餘日。患者卽覺精神愉快。胃納增進。恢復全身細胞之活力。挽回日增消失之生活機能。阻止禾老先衰之現象。因之天然抵抗力增加。以致病勢轉佳。縮短治愈過程。且肺病患者常有遺精之症。若服用「還爾童」更屬適當。</p>
<p>三　鈣劑之於肺結核</p>
<p>鈣劑Calcium之成分為石灰質。其功用能使血液中增加大量之石灰質。沈着於病灶。使之硬化。促進疤痕結合。阻其滋蔓。且能制止發炎。凝血之力甚强。可防止咳血。因此之故。近今雖新藥迭出。而鈣之應用。仍未减弱也。</p>
<p>欲輸入多量鈣質於病人之體中。非用靜脈注射法不可。內服法雖每次能服多量。而不能盡吸收。仍多排出於體外。為效甚少。故市上發售之種種鈣劑。注射為有效。內服則毫無功效。病家若購之內服。徒耗金錢而已。</p>
<p>注射鈣劑。須每日一次。漸次增加其量。輕症注射五六十次。卽可見效。重症則非百次以上。不能見效。且注射手術頗難。須請熟練之醫師行之。</p>
<p>（本院訂有經濟療肺章程。包費注射。治愈為止。祇收費六十元。）</p>
<p>四　肺病者之劇烈運動是等於自殺</p>
<p>患肺病者身體削瘦者居多。常聞人管。運動能使身體強健。肌肉發達。於是病者不加考慮。不計利害。卽從事運動。遂致病勢日益加深。不可救藥。殊不知運動健身乃為常人之道。病人不可一概而論。因肺病者之肺部巳受損傷（卽結核）欲使之全愈。當使細胞包圍病部。促成結疤而愈。今如從事運動。使血行加速。肺之呼吸深長。致使肺之結核病灶易於破裂。不能結疤。同時更予癆菌（卽結核菌）以蔓延之機會。可悲熟甚。故余謹以十二分至誠。大聲疾呼吿諸君曰。「患肺癆者必須安靜修養。千萬不可運動。運動就是自殺」</p>
<p>五　肺部病竈結疤卽為結核治愈之象</p>
<p>肺病治愈之生理解剖現象。為肺臟結核之病灶。被人體細胞組織包圍。結成疤　。於是各種病象皆退。而復健康。故體力健者身上之抵抗力足。細胞卽有力包圍病部。結成疤痕而愈。故吾人治療肺癆之根本原則。卽基於此。</p>
<p>近世學者以藥劑治療結核為不可靠。且有危害人體之毒性作用。確非安全治療之法。故現今學者根據上述結疤治愈之原理。則另闢新徑。趣用臟器療法。（卽用動物之肺臟及脾臟製劑）用於結核症。頗有卓效。</p>
<p>此項臟器製劑之最先發明者。即市間暢銷之「肺活」Phith　Weal是也。本品為臟器療治結核之鼻血。堪稱世界獨創之療肺聖藥。</p>
<p>「肺活」Phith　Weal內所含成分。乃哺乳動物新鮮肺臟。脾臟。肝臟。睾丸等臟器中提出之荷爾蒙Harmon聯合製成。此外尚有壯補之卵黃素（又名類脂質）Lecithin及鎭咳。祛痰等珍貴藥物配合其中。病者用此一藥。（肺活）可勝服十餘種。同時能收各種功效</p>
<p>凡結核患者服用以後。即見食慾增進。睡眠酣暢。盜汗消除。體重增加。精神活潑。面色紅潤。有熱者熱度低退。咯痰稀鬆。咳嗽减少。乃至完全停止。</p>
<p>由科學上言之。在服用後。此類臟器有效成分。即由胃液吸收入血。循環於身體各部。而對於肺部更呈直接之作用。鼓舞病灶已衰退之組織。保持圓滿調和其機能。促進組織新生。塡補其缺損。（補茸空洞）同時在病灶之周圍。築成鞏固結締組織牆壁。使之硬化。結成疤痕。完全包裏惡魔之結核菌。斷其食糧。令其自向死滅。本劑且有促進血液之凝固作用。防止　血之效力。亦甚顯著。此曾由各國醫家實騐證明之。</p>
<p>近來余用「患　」Phith　Weal治療肺病者一百人之果。治愈者佔百分之八十五以上。開近世治療肺病之新紀錄。實為最穩妥最有效之結核治療劑。即第三期肺病患者。用此劑治　。往往亦能收意想不到之效果。而治愈者亦有多人。</p>

<p>— 愛梅</p>
<p>在十年前，號稱五省聯帥，威震一時；而失敗後，却去奉佛虔修，自懺殺業的孫傳芳，最近，被自稱替父報仇的女子施劍翹，刺死於天津之佛敎居士林了。於此，我想起了他的一些舊事，大可和讀者們談談。</p>
<p>民國十五年的初夏，我與孫氏，曾有一面之緣；其時，我纔有十三歲，正在寳應思補小學讀書；適當他退守江北。前幾天，先是一營殘兵，敗退下來；不管三七二十一，跑進我們校裏，就把課堂攪散；慌得敎師們退位讓國，嚇得學生們鴉飛雀亂；於是，學校就此罷課，改作丘八的行營。再過幾天，聯帥的御駕（？）親臨了。記得那時的縣知事，姓謝，名瑩，字時同，忙著率領全城文武，開會歡迎；偏生呌各校師生，也去參加。因此，我也得見金顏，眞是三生有幸。承聯帥的情，對我們訓誨鼓勵了一番，好像還賞賜了些金錢，更屬熱忱可感。所可惜的，我們在當時，巳讀不成齊，那也是受的聯帥所賜啊！</p>
<p>晚上，散會回家，對日間的情形，少不得閒話一番。便引起先君的談鋒，說了一件傳聞的寃案，—也就是孫氏的往事來：「齊盧戰爭之時，孫氏開始得意了。從來居高思危，自要排除異己；便委了無數的便衣偵探，密佈各埠，偵捕那所謂亂黨。其時，鎮江有個本行的小老闆，姓陳。因家裏婆媳不和，經不起兩邊受氣，便離家私走，到了上海，打算自謀生活。誰知，一住半個月，還尋不着事，帶的川資又少，漸已用完；終天悶在旅館裏，免不得長吁短　。恰巧鄰號房間，住著一個偵探，他因捕不着反動份子，也正在愁眉不展。對隔璧嘆息之聲，連聽了三天之久，忽然計從心上起，惡向胆邊生。便走了過去，與這姓陳的周旋起來，兩下談得投機，從此成了朋友。姓陳的涉世日淺，沒甚社會常識，不免將自己的身世，和企圖，和盤託出。那偵探更中下懷，就用了番花言巧語，自稱：是孫聯帥的心腹，允許代他薦事，准可成功，連吹帶拍，哄他去到南京。姓陳的豐有不樂從之理？過了一天，那偵探便拿出一個紙包，和一封信，都是密密封裏，交給姓陳的道：「這信是我寫的薦信紙包裏，是聯帥的文件，曾有信向我討取，煩你一幷帶去，面呈聯帥吧！」便將姓陳的送上了火車。等車）開，立時一個電報，拍給孫氏，說：有亂黨陳某，於某時搭車進省，某時可到，請即派兵到站　緝。」這姓陳的，車方抵站，便見一隊兵士，擁上車來。問道：誰是陳某某先生？」他以為是來迎接他的，大喜之下，趕忙上前承認。那知兵士們，立時反臉，將他綁了起來，一面搜他行李，將那封信，和紙包查出，拆開一看，盡是反動文件，信却是那偵探向聯師報功的。更不由他分說，早鷹抓燕雀一般，將他押赴藥街，就此槍決。原來：孫氏已吩咐過他們：「自己有事，無暇審問；此去如搜不着證物，權且羈押再說；如果證據確實，則着先行正法，再來繳令」。等到姓陳的家裏得耗，雖然省裏有路，本可營救，却怎會來得及呢？可憐只有赴省，領回一具含寃的屍體罷了。這事，在先君談時，於死者及其家屬的名字還有木行的字號，皆說得源源本本的。及今閱時巳久，早已忘却，只好就事記事而已。</p>
<p>現在，孫氏是死了；關於他一生的是非功罪，將來自有史筆來裁判，我今無須僥舌。不過想到這「星移物換，十載滄桑」；自不免為他作：「一世之雄，而今安在」？之感呢！</p>

<p>籬笆的缺口巳相當大，狗是可以自由自在地進出了；人，假如肯受點委曲，俯了身也可以進退自如。而在野孩子的筐內，却儘是，一色的被折斷了的籬笆竹，由此也足證籬竹的去處和小樵夫的柴的來源了。</p>
<p>那最小的孩子拉得了一根，卽便追踪退進對面的弄堂，我因為好奇心的驅使，想看看他們的神色與表情，站在弄口不走。不料那最小的孩子却從容地對我說：</p>
<p>怎麽？要進去嗎？不進去，我就要關門了。</p>
<p>隨卽他把弄堂的半扇鐵門掩上了，我隱約看見他們在做折斷的工作。</p>
<p>在途中想，這不祗是敎育問題，還是一個嚴重的社會問題呢。</p>

<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（問）什麽叫做肝蛭病？</p>
<p>（答）肝蛭病（Distenriasis　hepates）是肝臟內有一種蛭（二口吸蟲）寄生而起。</p>
<p>（問）怎樣會被這種蟲寄生呢？</p>
<p>（答）這種寄生蟲，幼蟲先寄生於水族中的　和鯽魚等的體內；人們吃了之後就寄生在肝臟內。</p>
<p>（問）人們肝臟內有了這種蟲的寄生？便發怎樣的病狀？</p>
<p>（答）普通在夏秋的時候開始，覺得食慾亢進，胃部有膨滿之感，有時起泄瀉。而肝臟腫大；後來又縮小。肝表面平滑，但沒有壓痛。</p>
<p>（問）病勢更進行，病人覺得怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）病勢愈進，更見劇烈的泄瀉。因爲寄生蟲的刺戟而有多量的膽汁流入腸內。起下肢的浮腫，腹水，夜盲症等。脾臟也腫太。此外還要發貧血，衂血，吐血，瀉血等。因而病人全身衰弱致死。和肝硬變相不同的是腹水之外同時見皮膚的浮腫。</p>
<p>（問）病勢是否一路進行的嗎？</p>
<p>（答）不。普通在冬季輕快夏秋增惡。</p>
<p>（問）應該和什麼病相區別？</p>
<p>（答）應當和肝碎變病相區別。祗須檢查大便中有無蟲卵。</p>
<p>（問）這種病是否危險？</p>
<p>（答）對於生命危險較少；可是泄瀉劇烈或各處出血的，却屬危險。</p>
<p>（問）怎樣治療肝蛭病？</p>
<p>（答）人們若吃了被狗絛蟲（Distomiasishepatescoccus）所汚染的蔬菜便在肝臟內發生包蟲腫的病，有單房性和多房性二種。所以肝包蟲腫，就是狗絛蟲約寄生於肝臟內的病。</p>
<p>（問）單房性肝包蟲腫的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）若發生在肝表面的時候肝臟部生彈性沉動性降起，跟着呼吸移動。雖沒有貧血或惡病質等病狀，但往往有許多合併症像胞蟲化膿向胃腸內穿孔。</p>
<p>（問）多房性肝包蟲腫的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）很少。肝臟部成硬固的腫瘍不呈波動而有壓病。往往發黄疸，腹水，脾腫或胃腸出血等。</p>
<p>（問）這這種病危險不危險？</p>
<p>（答）單房性的不很危險；多房性的危險。</p>
<p>（問）怎樣治療肝包蟲腫？</p>
<p>（答）單房性的，可施行手術療法；多房性的却不能。</p>

<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（七十一）　耳內異物</p>
<p>耳內異物的一症。是指外聽道存有異物而言。異物的種類很多。譬如豆類珠子，鈕扣，小的介殼，火柴梗，以及蚊，蠅，蝨，臭蠻，等等。均可侵入耳內。侵入的機會。則有自動的及被動的兩種。小兒往往玩弄豆類，珠子，鈕扣等物。自行置入耳內。成人每有用火柴梗（代替耳勉）搔爬外聽道的習慣。以致常易折斷侵入耳內。二者均爲自動的侵入。至於蚊，蠅，蝨，臭蜸等類。則大都屬於被動的侵入。由異物侵入耳內所引起的症狀。甚有不同。有侵入耳內。經過數年。亦毫無症狀發現的。有損傷外聽道或鼓膜的損傷。而患者自己頓呈恐怖驚惶狀態的。有起初並無耳鳴，頭眩，耳鳴，難聽等症。後因侵入水液。</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>方始引起此等症狀的。不一而足。現在姑從異物的種類。分條略述牠所引起的症狀如左。</p>
<p>（一）豆類——小兒自行置入耳內後。本可不發若何症狀。但是耳內一旦滴入水掖（洗臉沐浴）。則豆類遇水膨漲。充塞耳內。以致小兒頓感耳嗚，頭眩，難聽等症。引起父母的注意。而求治於醫。</p>
<p>（二）珠子，鈕扣，小的介殼——此類多為圓形。並不損傷外聽道，或鼓膜。即遇水分亦不膨漲。所以往往經過數年．亦毫無症狀發現。</p>
<p>（三）火柴梗——火柴梗的施用。多為制止外聽道的搔癢。一時因止癢心切。用力必大。所以牠所造成的結果。有二。一為火柴梗容易折斷。侵入耳內。變為耳內異物。一為損傷外聽道（最多）。或者侵及鼓膜。變為外聽道炎或中耳炎。頓起腫脹，疼痛，膿潰等等痛苦。這是我們屢次遇著的。</p>
<p>（四）蚊，蠅，蟲，臭鱉——這些小生體的侵入耳內。完全是為了　入。所以在耳內時時飛躍行動。設法退出。此時患者感覺耳內有物行動。以為已經侵入腦內。頓時發生恐怖驚惶。其實從解剖上說起來。是不會侵入腦內的。</p>
<p>照上面所述的異物。千萬不可自己設法取出。或由無醫學智識的理髮匠。齡摘亂爬。因為常可弄巧成拙。反被推入深部。或者損傷外聽道或中耳。引起痛苦及危險。所以務必由醫詳細診察異物的種類，大小；形狀及牠的所在情形。相機應用滴耳法，洗耳法，或摘出法。甚至竟須施用手術。方為妥當。</p>

<p>— 鐘志和</p>
<p>（三）環境吾國人每喜聚族而居。烟戶稠密。小屋櫛此。空氣沔　。少戶外運動。不講求衛生。公眾團體機關工廠學校等處少衛生之設備。使人抵抗減弱。易染斯疾。</p>
<p>（四）預習A，隨地吐痰。散播病菌。最近中國紅十字會第一醫院肺癆科醫師在小菜場街上熱鬧處實地檢取地上痰液一百例。其中百分之十痰液中含有結核桿菌。TB為數之鉅。較之上述的百分數尤強。吾國人每將痰液隨意吐出。不加檢查。故結核特多。而由B，飯前不洗手。塵埃傳染乃於不知不覺中將結按桿菌帶人口中。或入呼吸道。</p>
<p>（五）牛乳獸類患結核者。以牛為最多。而人類之飲牛乳者日益增多。苟牛雙不加檢查。將病牛之乳供人飲服。則每將結核症傳之於人。</p>
<p>（六）傳染A，與病人接談。B接吻。C，共食而不分食。D，與病人之衣服被褥器具碗筷痰杯等接觸不慎。如醫院中之工役護士醫師等有時每易受染。E，據美國公共衛生局調查。郵局職員因每日收發信件。與郵票接觸。受郵票上病菌的傳染。大約每天發信一百至五百封者。有百分之一患結核症。此蓋因常人之習慣。每以口涎濕郵票之背面。貼於信封上故也。</p>
<p>（七）職業凡從事火車輸船工廠中之機師工役。終日飽受煤氣之侵襲。每易患肺癆。此外如石匠礦工皮貨匠等吸入雜質。亦易於致肺病。又靜坐少見曝光之工作者。易使體弱患肺病也。</p>
<p>（八）體質　癆瘵質。易羅肺癆。</p>
<p>（九）特殊性熱病及慢性病如百曰咳，胸膜炎，肺炎，麻疹，糖尿症之患者。均易染肺癆。</p>
<p>（十）局部情狀　如育癆淋巴腺結核症等之患者每同時發肺癆。（十）（一）核桿菌Bacillus　tuberclb</p>
<p>（四）肺癆之症狀——</p>
<p>按肺癆之症狀。約有下述數端。一，夢嗽吐痰。（二）咯血約佔百分之六十至八十。（三）盜汗。（四）潮熱。每於午後傍晚自覺。（五）面頰腓紅。（六）食慾減退。體重減輕。（七）胸痛。（八）貧血消瘦。（九）煩躁易怒等。最近美國彼得奇氏將症狀按原因的分類。更為明了。茲特記之於從。肺結核症普通症狀的原因分類法。</p>
<p>第一屬症狀之因血中毒老（一）缺少忍耐力。Lock　of　eudulauec（二）疲乏無力。（三）神經不安定。Nerve　instability（四）消化受累。（五）新陳代謝受擾之結果。使體重減輕。（六）脈搏增速。（七）盜汗。（八）體溫升騰（九）血液之變化。</p>
<p>第二屬症袱之因反射所致奢。（一）聲音嘶啞。（二）喉部發癢。（三）咳嗽。（四）消化受累。體重城少。（五）血運循環之變化。（六）胸部與肩胛疼痛。（七）兩頰腓紅。（八）肩胛帶部之肌肉起痙攣。膈中心腱與膈腳起痙攣。（九）患側之運動。被牽曳而減少。第三　　症狀之因毒素及反射而起之局部療狀。（一）屢屢傷風。及延長之傷風。（結核性枝氣管炎）（二）咯血。（三）膜炎。（胸膜之結核）（四）咳嗽。</p>

<p>— 李興</p>
<p>最初發見的局部麻藥係高根。高根是由科卡葉中分析出來的化合物。南美洲智利與玻璃維亞的紅印第安人自古即嚼科卡葉以止飢湯或鮮除困乏或激刺神經興奮。發見高根的先聲是一千八百六十年伍勒，尼門，勞生，三氏同時指出高根有麻木舌頭之作用，惜未來意及其重要。一千八百八十年時英國醫藥委員會祗公認高根為奮興劑，可作咖啡素的代替品。同年安利普氏精密研究高根的各稱藥性。一八八四年科勒氏，維也納的眼科家試駙高根的普通藥性，他認高根麻木舌頭之作用為麻藥性。因為他注意的是眼科麻藥所以他試驗高根，先滴高根水於牲畜眼內，繼試驗在醫院的眼科病人眼內，他發見了高根是一種強有力的麻藥。於是他就在眼科學公會內報告出他的發見。從此時高根局部麻藥問世全球風行。</p>
<p>雖是有了高根為局部麻藥但高根並不是理想中的局部麻藥，因易中毒且用處有限。後學者又繼續研究高根代替品，又發見了好幾種較優的局部麻藥，到今日高根已漸用漸少，最近的將來恐不免僅留名於醫學史上。</p>
<p>局部麻藥之作用係局部麻木感覺神經（或作痛覺腦綫）。局部腦綫受了麻木在受傷時此不會傳遞痛覺到大腦司痛覺故傷處覺不到痛。比如，拔牙之先在牙根處注射麻藥，牙的腦綫與牙肉處的腦綫都被麻木了，此不能傳遞痛的感覺到大腦當中，所以拔牙就覺不到痛。局部開刀注射麻藥止痛共理由也是如此。如高根類的麻藥滴在粘膜上，如鼻內眼內，可起麻木作用。由此可見局部麻藥也不是什麼神妙作用。</p>
<p>少量注射麻藥與身影饗根小。一方面較蒙藥經濟，一方面也較蒙藥安全。現在最普通用的是挪復根，其毒性很輕，為注射麻藥中之最重要者。還有多種麻藥或用於滴擦或用於注射共作用也大同小異。</p>
<p>高根除麻木性外也有麻醉性其作用為先激刺後壓抑。高根犯視高根為奮興劑，性質作用均與嗎啡相似故高根亦為嚴禁毒品之一。美國之高根犯多是黑人，或娼妓，或各種刑事兇犯。其犯罪之責任當有一部分是由於高根之激刺與混亂神經作用。醫師用高根於外科手術是有益於病人，但無知人亂用注射助奮興狂妄以驅自己於萬惡之途，實自己甘作人類之害蟲，故其受國家之極刑也為理所當然。（完）</p>
<h3 id="c229">牙齒常識問答（十）（一） <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— 林鑑賢</p>
<p>（第五八問）　蛀牙為什麼最應注意？</p>
<p>（答）　第一，因為牠最普遍，第二，因為我們的牙齒，因蛀壞而損失的要算第一多。第三，因為牠聊了發生局部的疾病外，往往還能引起全身的各種疾病，影響健康甚大，第四，因為這種毛病，若是早事預防，可以減少，及時治療可以制止。所以最應注意，多加研究。</p>
<p>（第五九問）　我國向來為蛀牙的原因是什麼</p>
<p>（答）　以為是口內一種看得見蠕動的牙蟲。</p>
<p>（第六十問）　照現在醫學上的發明，蛀牙的原因是什麼？</p>
<p>（答）　最直接的原因，就是口內的酸質。牠能夠溶解的牙磁中的膠質，消失牙齒中的石灰質。所以牙齒受酸質侵蝕的部分，就會漸漸軟化，腐爛成洞。</p>
<p>（第六一問）　口內的酸質那裏來的？</p>
<p>（答）　由口內殘留的食物，尤其是炭水化物，如澱粉類糖類食物，以微生菌的作用，腐敗發酸，產生出來的</p>
<p>（第六二問）　食物餘留口內，為什麼極易發酵變酸？</p>
<p>（答）　凡食物起發酵作用，必須備有適宜的溫度，濕氣，和陰閉，而且必須有發酵微菌的存在，（我們釀烟釀醋的酵母，就是一種發酵菌，牛奶久置後會發變酸，也是發酵菌的作用。）我們的口內，溫度，濕氣，陰暗，均極適合發酵作用。而且潛藏著許多各類不同的微菌。所以食物留在口內，極易發酵變酸。口好比是製造廠。在這廠裏，食物為原料，微菌為製造者，酸質為製造物。若是沒有原料，或是沒有製造者，這有害的酸質，就不能產生。所以三者都可算造成蛀牙的原因。</p>
<p>（第六三問）這發酵的微菌是一種虫？</p>
<p>（答）　並不是我們向來所迷信的牙虫。牠人是植物性，並不是動物性。而且很小，一只牙齒上，就可附著幾萬萬個，決不是我們肉眼所看得見的。還有一層，這微菌本身，並不損害牙齒，所為害的，是牠們發育繁殖，時候所產生出來的乳酸。</p>
<p>（第六四問）蛀牙還有其他原因呈？</p>
<p>（答）　除了上述的主因外，還有許多助因，可以誘起蛀牙，幫助進行。這助順可分為全身和局部的兩種。</p>
<p>（第六五問）屬於局部的助因有幾種？</p>
<p>（答）　限於口腔局部的助因有：（一）口腔衛生的疏忽，懶於刷牙，任食物停積。（二）牙齒排列不正，參差不齊，不易洗刷。（三）牙齒硬傷，發生裂縫（四）多食含炭水化物的柔軟食品，如米類麥類糖類等，和少食粗糙富於　維質的食品，如蔬菜生果等。前者蝗粘附牙齒，利於發酸的進行，後者有磨練牙齒，及天然洗刷之效</p>
<h3 id="c230">肺結核淺說（七）（七） <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>（二）類脂肪體　這是一種風行已久的方法：就是現在也還有一部分人採用的其實他在治療上的成績，也不過對於患者這一般狀態，貧血食　等症象，不無進步是已；對於患者體重因之而增加，也屬可能之列的。對於肺部病歸本身，係沒有直接影響的。關於這一種製劑，世界各藥廠出品的，也狠不少；他的內容，也是每個不同，各異其趣的。其中的成份；有係卵燐脂和甘油合併的，也有類脂肪體和藥特靈合併的，還有由於脂肪類脂和蠟之合併的。他的應用，大概是藉注射手續以人人體的；也有製成軟膏以外用塗　的，但佔少數。</p>
<p>（三）藥物的　這也可喚作化學治療。我們曉得，在現時肺結核之治療中，欲求一直接殺滅結核菌，而能無損於人體的藥物；所謂特效藥者，是決對沒有的。此處所提出的種種在臨床不磨的成績，是不可否認的；但藥理上　根據，和名符其實的特效藥相比較，還是差得狠遠，這是愛莫能助的　其間每一種的特點和價值，現在且分述於下面：</p>
<p>（甲）金製劑。關於金製劑之能殺滅結核　菌，老早已經有真確的證明了，但直接引用於治療上，對於人體係不無損害的；所以將金質製成無毒而有卓效之藥品，係每一個藥學專家以及臨床之醫師都有這種期望的。但一直到現在，還是沒有完全成功。我們要曉得，現時治療肺結核之方針，不外兩途：一為設法消除病灶及菌互，二為增加病人本身之生活力，以抵抗病魔。金製劑雖然有直接殺菌的效力，但在臨床上應用之目的，還是偏於第二途的，所以這一類製辦新出品，　　出不　，但究竟免不上了是一種刺激療法，決不是特效劑：這是應該認識清楚的！</p>

<h3 id="c231">「禁止煤油運意，殆卽戰爭」歟？ <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— 方殷</p>
<p>十一月廿五日路透羅馬電：「各國如禁止運煤與油至意，則意國將退出國聯。據消息靈通之意人聲稱：慕沙里尼視斷絕煤油接濟為敵對行動，各國如果實施，則意國將重行考慮其在國聯之地位。國聯之實施財政經濟制裁，慕氏雖在抗議下接受之，但並未視為敵對行動，今如禁止意國必要之用品，使意國阿戰事益增困難，則必引起嚴重之局勢，似將在歐發生危險之反響」。</p>
<p>這次國聯在英法——特別是英帝國主義的支撑之下，實施了空前未有的強硬的對意侵阿戰爭的制裁，這舉動在表面上看來似乎頗有一些正義之感，但是實際上誰也曉得這是英意兩帝國主義者的正面衝突。不過我們也不能否認象蘇聯及一般弱小民族的國聯會員國，在這次制裁中表示着他們對阿的如許同情及援助的。</p>
<p>這制裁之於意國主義者，無疑的是極嚴重的威脅，意首相慕沙里尼在其一再抗議和考慮退出國聯，降及於將國內現金集中，限制貨物出口，和節縮各種消費……等等的辦法當中，表示出他對這制裁是多麼焦心爛額的籌謀應付，以圖解除侵阿戰爭和一般局勢上的困難。這困難，使意大利感到最難受的，自然就是各國之禁止煤油運意。</p>
<p>在現代的戰爭國，煤油是佔着非常重要的位置的，禁止煤油運意，無異卽是使意大利在侵阿戰爭上失去重要的連環，把意大利歷歷勝利的前功盡棄。而意國本身，又不是一個產煤與油得國家。這威脅旣如是重大，意大利自不能不謀與之抗拒；因之，歐洲局勢，將因此而「發生危險之反響」，也是無疑的。</p>
<p>廿三日意國駐法大使曾訪賴伐爾宣稱：「對禁止煤油　意，殆卽戰爭之謂。」今慕沙里尼更「視斷絕煤油接濟為敵對行動，可見禁運煤油在目前歐洲局勢之影響。茍這局勢眞如電訉所傳，起了嚴重的變化，那末，駐法意使之言，則已夠使吾人嗅到火藥的氣味了。</p>

<p>夜躺在深沉的酣夢里，在那一條燃着闇色的瓦斯燈的街，有着荒凉的中古意味的，禮拜堂龐大的黑影伏在街上。這流浪異邦的諾曼斯夫民族的住宅區，是充滿了貴族的墮夢的沒落感和亡國感啊！</p>
<p>頹菲敗的屋舍，和嚼着莓苔的氣息，瞧着那些衣衫襤褸，而又滿面怨苦的，失去了明朗的笑的表情的帝俄遺民，可是住在這里却有很適宜的安靜，都市的喧闐完全隔離，罩着無邊的無邊的寂寞的氣氛。每天，除了禮拜堂敲着零落的鏡聲，就少有車輛經過，只讓溫柔的太陽佔頒着。</p>
<p>棲息的。</p>
<p>那個鬚髮斑班的屋主，他還是矜持着不甘放棄昔日有閑情調的生活方式：一早起來便督促僕歐洗刷樓梯，打去天花板上的灰塵。另後走出去買了一束鮮花，悠閑地走回來，插到瓶子里，接着拖出一隻　爛的拆了根脚的籐椅，坐到門外石階上曬太陽，低着頭，在那里做着粉碎了的華麗的夢吧。</p>
<p>「哈囉，Good　morning」</p>
<p>每次他瞥見我出來，總是這樣地說着不十分流利的英語，淡淡地用着無神的眼色向着我。</p>
<p>這異國的老流浪者，一身骯髒的衣服，而且破碎的。彷彿叫化子似的。但這不是使我討厭的地方，從最初為我所厭惡的，是像那樣過着渺茫的無家可歸的灰色　　　　　　　　　　　　　　地固守着沒落　階的紳士習氣，虛偽的布爾喬的儀式。這些可憐的人啊！</p>
<p>大大的屋子里，聲音是罕聽見的，而地板是舖着厚厚的毛氈，就述人的走勸的足音也沒有了。如同無入居住的空寂的寺院一樣。那屋主是不做事，老吃房租過日，他自已，就是用着沉思與回憶去消磨時間。他差不多是長長幾個禮拜不曾離開屋子一步，似乎已忘却了世界，同時也被世界所忘却。</p>
<p>然而使我警奇的是，有一天走進那屋主的臥室，那輝煌的奪目的陳飾，高貴的物具，富於藝術美感的佈一切簡直足一個布爾喬的人才有的。這映入眼廉的瑰麗的印象，我幾乎不能相信自巳的視覺。我又瞧那主人舊落的破碎的服裝，不禁引起一種非常矛盾的心理，舊俄羅斯帝皇的放逐者便是這樣不願掉開燦爛光榮的袍掛啊，可是燦爛老榮的袍掛已給布爾希維克的勇士搶去了，你們憑什麽去搶回來呢？</p>
<p>熟悉了的有着粟子的頭髮，碧色的眼珠的白俄流浪少女，也濃厚地保留着埋葬了的王的傲慢姿勢，也用着胭脂來挽回衰老的靑春，旗袍　然舊得變色了，但還披上穿洞的罩衫，走着是那麼慢斯條里地，一而走一面哼着有齊整韻味的曲子。就是在廚房里燒飯，也還不忘一邊做一邊唱着。她們好像已習慣了流浪的生涯，沒有了憶念，沒有了俄羅斯故國的憧憬，沒有了憂愁，而你們的姿色，你們的笑，你們的歌，讓誰去鑑賞，而又為誰而傾向着呢？是去到爵士歌樂的夜總會里邊，把身子倒在異方人的胸懷里，嘴唇的脂粉印上喝了酒的水手的高硬領去吧。</p>
<p>於是明天的羅宋菜，烟捲，由自已的身體的出賣換來了。</p>
<p>可是明天的明天呢？後天的明天呢？從西伯比亞放逐的出來少女啊，現在是冬天了，冬天的盛裝制造了沒有，溫暖的家國在什麽地方呢，聽着你們傾吐着熱戀之歌的知音者呢？</p>
<h3 id="c233">媳婦 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 胡慰雄</p>
<p>少奶奶拭乾了眼淚，剛想站起身到樓下去探個究竟，大大的怪聲又在隔屋裏叫了起來：</p>
<p>「我早說的，小人家小勢，什麽都不順眼！娶妻要娶敗落，你看罷，把你的兒子都趕出門了，你這老貨，看你還有什麽話說？」</p>
<p>雖然是老夫妻倆個相駡，太太故意拉開了嗓子要少奶奶聽見倒是眞的。少爺出門兩天沒有回家，少奶奶就哭了二整天—她對於丈夫早不抱什麽希望了，不過太太的指桑駡槐，借鷄打狗，把少奶奶駡得比什麽都不如。每天自早到夜，在樓下，在隔屋裏，像唱新聞似的隨意胡扯；有人客上門，太太更找到了對手，添油加醬，當作一個神話似的，顚來覆去，可以說上一十百遍。歸根一句話，是小人家小勢，什麼都不順眼；而自已寳貝兒子的過咎，是相反地誇獎地：—「人家說起來獨養兒子的脾氣寵壞了。我的阿祥就沒有脾氣，對爺娘孝順不必說，那貨色進門的時候，也是百順百依，—要他早一點回來罷，他就連小朋友的應酬都拒絕了；每天大包小包的帶回來去討她歡心。在這個時勢做男人家的那里不要在外面應酬應酬，那天回家晚一點，其實天還沒有亮，就哭呵巴的吵得合宅不安！哼！我們做媳婦的時候，還不敢大聲呵一口氣哩，她竟是什麼都罵了出來！你想想，我話了這末一把年紀，倒是討個媳婦來敎訓我，不要臉的貨色，天天要男人陪着睡覺才舒服嗎？」</p>
<p>太太有是竟時一口氣接不過來，連連揉着自家的胸脯，但是一轉身，她又像印刷機似的一遍一遍地叫着。老爺終竟還講公話：「這樣叫着鬧着什麼樣子！阿祥也不是東西，媳婦娶進門來才兩個月，就把她的陪嫁了頭阿香搭上了，現在外面又是花呵草呵地弄到深更半夜回來。新少奶奶勸勸也是道理，小夫妻淘里沒有鬧翻，到是你帮在里頭掏細竹梢……」</p>
<p>這一來，火上添油，把那些罵媳婦的字眼都搬到「老貨」身上，最後竟說老頭兒不轉好心眼兒，才帮着媳婦來敎訓老婆。</p>
<p>這兩天，公館里就像茶樓，有唱新聞的，有聽新聞的，惹得那些底下人掩着嘴笑，有的竟然一五一十到弄里去整</p>
<p>少奶奶兩整天沒有出房門，也沒有吃飯。阿香是她母家陪過來的婢女，因為被少爺搭上一手，也不敢見奶奶的面了。一個老媽子，她是乾領少爺長大的，就弄着茶飯到房里勸少奶奶，她低聲地說：</p>
<p>「太太就是這個脾氣，得風扯篷，這里底下人沒有一個做得長的。少爺也像太太的脾氣，我雖是乾領媽媽，我不瞞天不瞞地，這脾氣是難弄！奶奶不要氣，吃一點飯，氣壞了才不合算呢。像新奶奶這樣漂亮，好好勸勸，少爺總會回心轉意的。」</p>
<p>少奶奶點點頭，其實她一句話都沒有聽得，她覺得這宅子里的人都像魔鬼一樣可怕，自己就是魔鬼爪牙下的俘虜，算是同自己一路的阿香，也上了他們的鈎。少奶奶對這臥房里的傢具瞥了一眼，一幅並蒂蓮花映在對面的穿衣鏡里，她把老媽子推了出去，倒在床里哭了，但是她不敢哭出聲來。</p>
<p>她怨自家的命運，怨自己家里貧窮，那末許多人來做媒，却嫁了這末一個丈夫。兩個月就把自己拋棄了，婆婆又是個蠻不講理的老虎。她想馬上回家，到在母親懷里哭個暢快，但是回門時母親怎樣敎訓自己的呢：現在是做媳婦了，比不得在家里做小姐，處處要依順公婆意思，小夫妻淘里也要好好的，不能使性子！做媳婦要做奴隸一樣的侍奉她的主子嗎？少奶奶向着自己。雖然有一個同情的回答在她耳邊響着，但是她抬起頭來的時候，房內空空地祗有她一個人。婆婆的鐵嗓子又在隔屋里叫了起來</p>
<p>「…哼！吃　們姓陸的飯不是好吃的，餓死了祇當死了一條狗，姓陸的門楣會討不着這樣的貨色嗎？阿祥一天不回來，就一天不許送飯進去，你們聽見了沒有？」</p>
<h3 id="c234">窗前小記 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— 太郎</p>
<p>（一）小先言</p>
<p>我總是伏在這隻唯一的靠近窗前的小寫字臺上，寫着，寫着，……當覺得疲乏的時候，我就喝茶，抽烟，來興奮刺激我的精神，可是有一個時候當茶和烟失却了牠們的功效，我就用我兩隻枯瘦的手，捧着我的劇痛的頭兒，望一望窗前的那顆不知名的老樹，暫時來舒散我一下悶塞的胸頭。</p>
<p>幾時讓我離開這窗前，雖然是一秒鐘也好的，只要那一秒鐘是面着忘我的前邊。</p>
<p>（二）碎餅乾</p>
<p>桌子的左角，是剩有小半袋的碎餅乾。…</p>
<p>當我提着碎餅乾回「家」的時候，孩子是歡喜得跳起脚來，用着萬分親摯的聲調叫我：</p>
<p>「爸爸！爸爸！」</p>
<p>我笑着向孩子看了看，只見她的小眼睛像餓貓那麽，儘瞧着那袋碎餅乾。她舐着嘴唇，問我：</p>
<p>「爸爸！這裏是什麼哪？」</p>
<p>「餅乾哩！」</p>
<p>見着孩子那種窮得可憐的面相，我的心頭有一種說不出來的酸楚。妻也挨近了我的身邊來，我坐下椅子，孩子很敏捷地爬上了我的膝頭。我顫抖着手，不，顫抖着我的心呵！我把那袋碎餅乾打了開來。孩子連忙用小手向紙袋口掏了進去，抓出了一大把餅乾來，她一看，楞了一眼，臉上顯出懷疑的神情來，向我望了一望，隨後就把碎餅乾向嘴裏塞去，我揀了塊大的，遞給妻：</p>
<p>「你也嚐一塊吧！」</p>
<p>妻默聲地接受了我遞給她的。當我自己也揀了塊拿進嘴裏去的時候，孩子忽然問我了：</p>
<p>「爸爸！為什麽這餅乾是碎的呀？」</p>
<p>我呆看了！我幾乎要向孩子叫起來。</p>
<p>「你，寳貝！為什麼要問我這呀！」</p>
<p>可是我總究沒向孩子那麽叫，我只溫柔地對孩子說。</p>
<p>「你吃吧！」</p>
<p>（三）落葉</p>
<p>我不能伏着寫了，茶和烟失了牠們興奮我精神的功效。我捧着頭向窗外望。——那顆老樹上的葉，隨着一陣球風吹來，掉下去了！</p>
<p>這境况在別人看起來，或許是感不</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>到什麽的，然而在我，我，我却不忍卒看了！我深閉着眼兒，無限的哀痛兜上胸頭，天呵！我，我，…</p>
<p>我每在深夜，就醒了轉來。照理，我這疲勞的身體，在夜晚該睡得多好呵！可是相反，我醒轉來了，我再也不能睡着了！刺痛肺的咳嗆，徹夜不息。有時把妻咳醒了，她矇矓着眼，搖　者脚，爬起牀來給我倒了杯熱開水，叫我喝。看我喝開水的時候，妻掩起臉來哭了！落葉，爲什麽徧要在我眼前掉呀！</p>
<p>（四）魚肝油</p>
<p>一見着那落葉，更感到自己生命的向幻滅之路去的恐懼，我不願就這末年靑死去，我要活，因爲我有未了的責任。</p>
<p>魚肝油，那廣告上寫着；「……皆有實效，而尤以治肺為專長，……」用自己的血換來的錢，我買了一瓶。——可是現在，那瓶魚肝油只要沒有一禮拜就可喝光啦！妻瞟着那一眼，偷偷拿着些東西出去了，回來的時候，買着一袋的米。</p>
<p>我什麼都當作不看見，儘望着瓶裏那些僅有的魚肝油。</p>
<p>我又看見了窗前的落葉。</p>
<h3 id="c235">生活（續） <a href="#c235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— 吉彖</p>
<p>那麼着，在「塲子」與「老闆」的名稱下，阿林底心漸漸地跳得快起來了。他在街上的「芝軒居」茶館裏設了一個塲子，給朋友們「玩玩」麻雀，撲克，牌九……也不是一天兩天了呀！阿林在一班「白相人」的弟兄面上有點「交情」，也是誰都知道的啊！靠了這「塲子」，他巳經弄了好一些附近的工人們的銀，自己居然討起小老婆來了。可是他是在「弟兄」面上結交的，他有「小斧頭」給他「包塲」！</p>
<p>面對着這場面，他哈哈地笑起來了：「朋友，我欠你什麽呢？那是「賭賬」嗎？哈哈，好極了，好極了，你報局子叫人來抓我好了啊，你到衙門裏去告找好了啊，那是「賭賬」，是不是？」</p>
<p>蛇一樣的惡毒的語句打在王大個子的恍惚的心裏，想到一年多的失業，想到輸去了的許多錢（現在，是變成重利的債了），想到明天的生活，他呆住了；一股熱氣從心裏衝上來，他突然地淸明起來了，猛地抓住了阿林的衣襟，像牛一樣地把這龐大的身驅拉出門來，撲過去。</p>
<p>「我輸了的錢！你這騙子！你這………强盜！」</p>
<p>兩個影子絞在一起，駡着，撲着，毆打着，帶着用來對付肉的生活的仇恨，帶着剛才灌下肚去的劣質的酒性，帶着這些日子的生活的苦惱，王大個子像發狂一樣地摔着阿林，阿林伸過手去摸挿在褲帶上的小斧頭，可是沒有。</p>
<p>鬧聲傳開去，在黑夜的街頭，三條影子奔着過來了！他們像野獸那樣地毆打着紅了眼睛的王大個子……他是不斷地在駡着：「你這騙子！你這吸血的鬼！」的……最後，有一個人拿斧頭在個子的肩頭上猛地砍了一下！</p>
<p>一聲怪叫在黑夜裏騰起來，王大個子的平鬆了，三把斧頭像兩點一像地落下去，終於，血像水一樣地流出來，人便被浸在裏面了。</p>
<p>悄悄地，三個「弟兄」又從黑暗裏溜了去，阿林帶着傷對他們說，「也叫人知道我們的利害啊……有寫意的，明天再說話。要是有事呢？我來包塲，我來！」</p>
<p>一切仍歸靜寂，街燈照着倒在瀝再路上的一堆血肉，現在，他再也不用憂愁明天的生活……因爲他已經沒有朋天的生活了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Situation in Hebei is Extremely Tense: He Yingqin Bears the Heavy Responsibility of Breaking the Deadlock, Will Consult with All Parties to Find a Suitable Solution; A Political Affairs Organ Will Still be Established in Beiping; Song Zheyuan Issues a Proclamation to Reassure the People and Forbid Rumor-Mongering <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the stabilization of the current situation in Hebei, Zhu Zheyuan has telegraphed Jiang (Chiang Kai-shek) explaining the current state of affairs and requesting prompt instructions for effective measures. The central government has dispatched He Yingqin from Nanjing to the north. Local authorities are currently giving serious consideration to the issue of dealing with the current situation, unwilling to make any hasty pronouncements, and are still awaiting the final decision of the central government. A certain important Japanese figure has remained in Beiping since arriving, and has been visiting our authorities for talks every day. It is heard that the Hebei situation is not far from resolution due to simultaneous consultations between the central and local authorities, and a concrete resolution may be unveiled within a day or two. A kind of political affairs organ will still be established in Beiping. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) It is reported that He Yingqin will arrive in Beiping and will convene the authorities of North China to discuss strategies for stabilizing the current situation. He Yingqin's trip to the north indeed carries the heavy responsibility of breaking the current deadlock. Shang Zhen yesterday dispatched Li Peiji, the Director of the Civil Affairs Department, from Baoding to Beiping to represent him in liaising with Song (Zheyuan) on all matters. Li visited Song Zheyuan this afternoon to convey Shang's suggestions to Song regarding the stabilization of the situation in North China. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Due to the unsettled situation and the proliferation of rumors, which have caused public unrest, Commander Song Zheyuan of the Beiping-Tianjin Garrison and Zhang Weifan, the Director of the Beiping Municipal Police Bureau, issued proclamations one after another today to reassure the people, stating that those who spread rumors and stir up trouble will be severely punished. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chen Juesheng will go to Tianjin tonight, representing Song (Zheyuan) to meet with all parties and make contacts. He is scheduled to return to Beiping from Tianjin within a few days to report to Song. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Tianjin Mayor Cheng Ke and Police Chief Liu Yushu are both preparing to go to Beiping to meet with He (Yingqin) and request instructions on Tianjin's security measures. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan telegraphed Jiang (Chiang Kai-shek) on the 30th, stating that worries and calamities were accumulating, the situation was critical, and he had repeatedly telegraphed to report, hoping for (the central government's) observation. He said that now in the cities and towns, some are advocating autonomy, some are advocating self-determination, and suppressing them one by one is both beyond his ability and a futile struggle that will not produce results. Zheyuan is of meager virtue and limited ability, and his pacification is ineffective. Considering the overall situation, it seems that guiding the situation with the trend and seeking another effective method to comfort the people's expectations and stabilize their hearts is necessary. Even if external troubles are not taken into account, internal worries are also worrisome. Zheyuan is in charge of this land and has more detailed knowledge. What his heart considers dangerous, he dares not not report. He respectfully telegraphs to report, with utmost trepidation awaiting orders. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the Military Council concludes, the various documents are now being packed into boxes, ready for transport south. The guard battalion of the council went to Shaanxi for service in its entirety on the first. (1st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 11:00 AM on the first, over a hundred armed Japanese soldiers in Tianjin paraded around the Hebei area, returning to their camp at noon. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Tianjin branch of the Greater Asia Association, chaired by General Matsui Iwane, was established on the first by Qi Xieyuan, Gao Lingwei, Wu Yulin, Li Shengduo, Wang Yongquan, and other out-of-office warlords and politicians. The location is in the Japanese Concession. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The city of Tianjin is extremely peaceful. After 10 PM, armed security teams work extra shifts, assisting various districts in their precautions. A certain country previously used Chinese traitors to form a petition group and a suicide squad, originally issuing a fee of 2,000 for the suicide squad and 5,000 for the petition group, but it turned out to be embezzled by those in charge. The country believes it has been deceived and is now ordering several retired warlords residing in a certain concession to engage in organization, and the country is managing the funds and other matters internally. It is planned that when North China elsewhere has any performance, Tianjin will launch immediately. A certain large merchant in a Tianjin concession is contracting to make more than a thousand sets of fake suicide squad uniforms, with a deadline of five days to deliver the goods. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Kaifeng) He Yingqin arrived in Bian (Kaifeng) around 7 PM on the first by special train, alighting from the train. Liu Zhi greeted him, and they rested at the New Sports Association and had dinner there. At 9:30 PM, he continued north on the original train. (1st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) I inquired at the station on the evening of the 30th and learned that the special train of Minister He of the Ministry of Military Administration left Pukou at 6:45 PM on the afternoon of the 30th. The reporter went to the station at dawn on the morning of the 1st to meet him and boarded the train to inquire about the mission of this trip. I was told confidentially that the situation in the North is tense, and people are uneasy. The authorities and people's organizations in the North are appealing to the government to quickly find a way to deal with the situation, with letters and telegrams coming and going, and envoys visiting one after another. However, the situation there is extremely complex, and it is not easy to obtain the truth of the facts without conducting an on-the-spot inspection. Therefore, the government has specially sent me to the North to discuss in detail with the authorities in the North and jointly seek a suitable and appropriate solution to handle the internal matters that must be resolved at present, so as to satisfy the expectations of people at home and abroad. There is no other mission. As for whether to take up the new post of Chief Official of the Executive Yuan stationed in Beiping, it has not yet been considered at this time. (1st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shang Zhen's representative, Fu Liping, visited Zhu Zheyuan again on the morning of the 1st for talks. Li Peiji also visited Song (Zheyuan) at 2 PM on the afternoon of the 1st under Shang's orders to coordinate everything. (1st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin's arrival in Beiping is quite welcome, but many feel that the situation is already very critical, and He will not be able to do much to remedy it. It was previously expected that He would not necessarily go north to take up a new post, but now it is heard that he has already departed from Nanjing, which is quite unexpected. If He can preserve Chahar and Hebei for the central government, it would be like snatching a piece of wood that is about to burn from the fire. Even among the Japanese, those who do not acknowledge that Lai Zheyuan is subject to external pressure are only in official circles. It is heard that He Yingqin can arrive tomorrow morning, and all circles are paying close attention. (1st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Cheng Ke sent a telegram to the central government on the first, stating the critical situation in North China. The main points of the telegram are the same as those sent by Song Zheyuan. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) He Yingqin's special train arrived in Xu (Xuzhou) this morning. Huang Jie and others greeted him at the station. (1st Dispatch)</p>

There is still no definite news about the puppet Supervisory Office's involvement in the affairs of the Beining Railway. Traffic between Beiping and Yu is very safe. The station chiefs and section chiefs have all telegraphed to the bureau, and have not accepted the puppet order. Lu Mengxiong, the Deputy Director of the Beining Railway, went to Beiping to visit Song Zheyuan at 9:05 AM on the 1st to report on the recent situation of the railway traffic and request assistance in preventing the illegal encroachment of the puppet Jidong New Yu Section Supervisory Office on railway affairs. He returned to Tianjin by night train. (1st Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e12">The Path to Implementing Trade Controls <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>— Dao</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, in view of the increasing decline of domestic industry and commerce, has formulated measures to implement trade controls. This is truly the only important plan to revive and correct the ills of our country, and it is worthy of the unanimous support of people across the country. In short, the reason why our country is lagging behind in everything and being controlled by others lies in the underdevelopment of industry. However, it is not easy to jump from the realm of industrial backwardness to the realm of industrial development. In short, there are only two ways. (1) Use foreign capital. (2) Self-reliance. However, in today's world, using foreign capital will inevitably be ridiculed for not knowing the times. Although the European and American countries today have the intention of investing in our country, since Japan is obstructing them, they cannot avoid hesitating and stopping. As for the Japanese side, one is the lack of real investment strength, and the other is the question of whether its conditions can not damage our national sovereignty. Therefore, there is no hope of using foreign capital now. The only path that can be followed lies in self-reliance.</p>
<p>Self-reliance is not only the passive meaning of not borrowing foreign debts and not using foreign capital, but also the active meaning of seeking the development of one's own country's industry. In order to seek the development of one's own country's industry, in addition to conserving existing industries and promoting the vitality of their development and growth, it is also necessary to raise huge amounts of capital. Although China is in a position of poverty and exhaustion today, its annual trade deficit is still more than 500 million yuan. Judging from the figures for the first half of this year, it is also more than 286 million yuan. If this huge amount of trade deficit can be intercepted in full, or most of it can be retained, then wouldn't it be a huge capital? Furthermore, if this huge amount of capital is purely used to purchase production tools, then pure self-reliance is not impossible. The amazing construction of the Soviet Union in the past seven or eight years can be used as a reference. After the Soviet revolution, material resources were exhausted and capital was short, which was no better than the current situation in our country. The hesitation of foreigners to invest is also very similar to the current situation in our country. The rapid progress of its first and second five-year plans can be said to be starting from scratch. Taking its example as an example, if our country has the determination to be self-reliant, why worry that it cannot become a reality?</p>
<p>As for how to stop the trade deficit and protect national industry, trade controls are the only way. The key to trade controls (1) lies in foreign exchange management, and (2) lies in the establishment of protective tariffs. If foreign exchange can be fully managed, then unnecessary imported goods can be disallowed when importers purchase foreign exchange. After the establishment of protective tariffs, the young national industry can achieve its function of flourishing and growing. Since the Ministry of Finance of our country implemented the new monetary system on the 4th of last month, it has been able to partially manage exchange rates. However, what has been achieved is only to stabilize exchange rates. As for using the control of exchange rates to further balance the volume of import and export trade, it is still not planned. If we only seek to stabilize exchange rates without further seeking to balance trade, then in order to pay for the international trade deficit, we still have to rely on the export of silver. In addition, the trade deficit is endless and silver is limited. It will inevitably be impossible to achieve long-term stability of international exchange rates. Therefore, using the power of foreign exchange management to further limit imports is the most urgent requirement today. We hope that the authorities will take another step forward. The revision of import tariffs is also a necessary plan today. This can echo the control of foreign exchange. That is, the import tax on luxury goods and the like may as well be as high as 100% of the value. Other commodities that China can manufacture itself must increase their import tax rates and limit their imports. Even for commodities that China cannot manufacture itself, it is also necessary to ask whether they are necessary. If they are not necessary, then their tariffs must also be raised to make them difficult to import. Only machines and tools that cannot be manufactured in China and are indispensable for production and construction can be granted tax-free treatment. If we can advance on both sides and strictly control foreign trade, then the development of China's national industry can be expected soon.</p>
<p>Our country is an agricultural country, and it is still impossible to talk about trade surplus. What we seek is nothing more than stopping and reducing the trade deficit, or saving unnecessary imports and replacing them with imports of production tools. As for the foreign side, there may be some obstacles to this kind of control. However, if we do not seek to change the situation for a long time, the vitality of our country will soon be completely cut off. Even if foreigners want to drain the pond to catch all the fish, they will not be able to get it. Therefore, all foreigners who truly have reason will be able to understand our difficulties.</p>

<h3 id="e25">After the Ministry of Finance Implements the New Currency System, It Is Planning the Second Step: Drafting Measures for Provinces to Establish Provincial, County, and Municipal Banks, and Verifying Methods for Receiving the Reserve Funds of Various Banknotes. <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After implementing the monetary policy, the Ministry of Finance is now planning the second step, such as establishing local banks and increasing the establishment of real estate mortgage loan banks, amending the Real Estate Mortgage Law, etc., and drafting measures for provinces to establish provincial, county, and municipal banks. The government shares cannot exceed 50%, and the rest will be raised from merchant shares, so that the people can supervise locally. The Ministry of Finance initially planned to establish county and township banks, but based on the current autonomous law regulations, the levels below the county are districts and towns. The name 'township' is not very consistent, and the situations vary from place to place. County towns are often not commercially developed areas, while the towns under their jurisdiction are often more lively than county towns. Therefore, it has been decided that in addition to establishing local banks in each county, establishing banks in various towns may be even more important than in county towns. After these measures are announced, the existing local banks in each province will be made consistent, with the aim of promulgating these laws within the year so that they can be implemented step by step. The Ministry of Finance has established a real estate mortgage loan bank to promote the vitality of real estate. Currently, the business of the Bank of Communications is originally intended to gradually develop it into a bank for developing industries. The real estate mortgage is entirely for developing industries and increasing production, so it is planned that the Bank of Communications will undertake it. However, this proposal is still awaiting the final decision of the minister. As for the nine articles of the Shanghai Municipal Land Occupation Certificate Mortgage Law, there are still some points in the procedure for declaring the auction of overdue mortgages that do not fully comply with the property rights section of the Civil Code. Revisions have already begun, and the Executive Yuan will convene a review meeting in the near future. After being passed by the Yuan meeting, it will be promulgated by the National Government. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) In the initial implementation of the new currency system, the legal reserve funds of issuing banks in Shanghai other than the Three Banks, as well as all new and old banknotes that have been printed but not issued, issued but recovered, have been received uniformly by the Issuing Reserve Management Committee. The provincial and municipal banks established by the provincial and municipal governments, or those that have the nature of provincial and municipal banks under other bank names, have also stopped issuing various banknotes, and the new and old banknotes that have been printed but not issued, issued but recovered have been sealed first, along with the current amount of circulating banknotes. The number of reserves has been investigated, reported to the Ministry of Finance and is currently being verified by the Ministry of Finance. However, the banks of Hebei, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Gansu, Hunan, Hubei, etc., Henan Agricultural and Industrial Bank, Hangzhou Zhejiang Local Bank, Tianjin Dazhong, Gangye, Hankou China Farmers Bank, Beiping Beiyang, and Baoshang Banks have completed the receipt of the preparation of banknotes circulating in the market, along with the new and old banknotes that have been printed but not issued, issued but recovered, by the local Three Banks Association or independently. All post-event measures after the provincial and municipal banks stop issuing and hand over the reserves are being consulted with them at any time, and the situation is very good.

<p>(Washington) Secretary of the Navy Swanson released his annual report today, advocating the construction of warships as permitted by the treaty but opposing expansion. He stated that the future of naval armaments is uncertain, and the nature of any future treaty is currently unpredictable. U.S. policy should remain unchanged for the time being, and the program to build new ships totaling 1,125,200 tons should continue. Currently, 85 ships totaling 283,150 tons have been appropriated for construction. What is urgently needed is to improve the auxiliary fleet with types sufficient for deployment, which should be prepared gradually as soon as possible. New ships are gradually being completed, and the number of naval personnel must also be increased. (1st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of the Navy Swanson's annual report to President Roosevelt was released today. The report stated that the future of the naval disarmament treaty is difficult to predict, so he strongly advocated that Congress must stipulate the annual naval expenses so that the U.S. fleet can maintain the full strength permitted by the treaty. The current policy of the Navy Department has not changed and it is striving to ensure that the plan to build the navy to the current treaty strength can continue. The current efficiency and morale of the navy are very superior, and the American people need not worry too much. The U.S. has started construction or decided on the construction program for all warships that can be built before the current treaty expires. The only thing lacking is 35 destroyers and 14 submarines to replace the old ships, which have not yet been decided. Once the treaty expires, some battleships will reach the age of replacement, and the situation of the new treaty will be considered at that time. In addition, the auxiliary ships required by the fleet are also insufficient, and this aspect must also be addressed. The existing auxiliary ships are either too old or not fast enough, and they should be replaced as soon as possible. (1st National News Dispatch)</p>

As a result, the government bonds issued by general accounting were reduced by approximately 70 million yen compared to the previous fiscal year, stopping at 680 million yen. However, the total amount of Japanese government bonds has reached 9.558 billion yen from the end of October to the present. If the planned number of government bonds to be supplemented by this year's revenue and the government bonds to be issued in the special accounting and supplementary budget to be decided in the future are added, the government bonds issued by Japan in the 11th year of Showa will break through 10 billion yen.

<p>(Tokyo) Overcoming the difficulties in compiling the budget and insisting on the policy of gradually reducing deficit government bonds, the government will devote all its efforts to dealing with the Diet in the future. However, it is still unclear what attitude the Seiyukai will adopt, so it is impossible to predict the Seiyukai's policy. Some cabinet members advocate taking preemptive action after the recess of the Diet and actively dissolving the Diet at the outset. The party cabinet members strongly advocate this. Also, the new party movement centered on Minister of Railways Uchida is considered no longer delayable and is urgently seeking to materialize. Therefore, the future movements of the new party are being watched by the government and opposition parties. On the one hand, the issue of clarifying the national essence, the North China issue, the Manchurian issue, and other important domestic issues are piled up like mountains. The government will use the remaining momentum from breaking through the budget compilation issue for multifaceted activities. (1st Dentsu Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e58">Regarding the Italian-Abyssinian Dispute, Britain and France Are Working Hard to Mediate; Hoare and Laval Will Meet to Discuss a Peaceful Solution <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>(London) According to observations by political figures here, the Italian-Abyssinian dispute will have an important development in the middle of next week, or even be decisive. The French government will submit the minimum settlement conditions drafted by Britain and France to the Italian Prime Minister, and Mussolini will reply to them. It is generally believed that Sanderson, the Abyssinian problem expert of the British Foreign Office, has been instructed to wait for the Italian reply in the French capital, so as to compare the conditions drafted by Britain and France. People here still hope that Foreign Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare will meet with French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval within the next few days and decide on the common attitude of Britain and France on the issue of oil embargo and the minimum conditions for Italian reconciliation. Regarding the oil embargo issue, the 18-nation committee is now scheduled to meet on December 12 to discuss it. Some people speculate that after the oil embargo measures are passed by the Sanctions Adjustment Committee, the date of its implementation may not be decided immediately, so that the ongoing negotiations between Britain, France and Italy can continue without being affected. In addition, the staff reporter also said that when Hoare and Laval meet in the future, they will also discuss the issue of Germany returning to the League of Nations and the air force, and both parties will reach an agreement. Regarding this issue, the British Foreign Office has sent Colonel Evers to Berlin several times and is still there. (30th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to information obtained by the company's diplomatic staff reporter, Premier and Foreign Minister Laval is extremely willing to meet with British Foreign Secretary Samuel Hoare before the 18-nation committee decides to implement the oil embargo measures, so as to jointly formulate a proposal to resolve the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, and which can be accepted by the Italian government before the League of Nations implements the oil embargo. It is now heard that the British government has also expressed its approval of the meeting between the diplomatic authorities of Britain and France, and the date of the meeting is also under consideration by both parties. Premier Laval initially intended to go to London in person to attend the opening of the London Naval Conference, so as to take the opportunity to exchange opinions with the British authorities on the Italian-Abyssinian issue. If not, Hoare may make a brief stop in the French capital on his way to Geneva to participate in the 18-nation committee, so that he can meet with Laval. If the above two methods are not possible, Laval and Hoare will be able to meet in Geneva when the 18-nation committee meets on December 12. At that time, it will not hurt to take the opportunity to discuss various outstanding issues. As for the statement issued by the Italian authorities yesterday on the oil embargo measures, saying that it will be regarded as an unfriendly move rather than a hostile act, French officials were quite satisfied when they heard it. In short, what the French government has always been concerned about is to make every effort to localize the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, and to try to avoid adopting oil embargo measures within the possible range. In addition, the French government is also eager for the talks between Sanderson, the British Foreign Office expert on Abyssinian issues, and Saint Quentin, the director of the African Department of the French Foreign Office, to be accelerated in order to formulate proposals that can be accepted by all parties. However, the British expert Sanderson has recently been ordered to return home before the establishment of a mutually agreed solution, so the talks between the two parties have to be temporarily suspended. As for the proposals currently being considered by the two experts Sanderson and Saint Quentin, it is heard that they are very similar to those drafted in October. However, at that time, they were once put on hold because they failed to obtain the approval of the League of Nations and the three parties of Italy, Abyssinia. It is now planned that Abyssinia will cede some territory to Italy, and other land will be ceded to Abyssinia to enable Abyssinia to obtain access to the sea in exchange for the territory of Abyssinia obtained by Italy, the main one being the southern Ogaden region. However, the proposal to divide Abyssinia's headquarters and frontier provinces into two seems to be opposed by the League of Nations and the Abyssinian Emperor, and even the cession of Tigre Province is not allowed. In addition, there are general plans, including the conclusion of a treaty to provide assistance to Abyssinia under the supervision of the League of Nations, which is one aspect. It is heard that the French government now hopes that the Italian government can take into account the views of all parties and put forward its own plans. If so, the ingredients for resolving the Italian-Abyssinian dispute can be gradually increased, and the proposal for an oil embargo may also be postponed. However, the Italian proposal must be submitted before the 18-nation committee meets. If not, once the oil embargo is passed by the committee, an order will be issued immediately. This is why French Premier and Foreign Minister Laval is eager for Britain and France to continue their efforts to mediate and wants to meet with British Foreign Secretary Hoare as soon as possible.

Recently, Italian troops were ambushed in the Gelar Tarté and Magal regions. Staff officers speculate that this was done by isolated Ethiopian elements infiltrating the Italian lines, as well as armed farmers in the occupied areas. Therefore, the above decision was made.

<p>Asmara: The Italian vanguard attempting to occupy the Danakil Highlands is now greatly troubled by the defensive army's guerrilla tactics. General Siyoum's troops are now divided into countless small units, each with about a hundred men, containing the advance of two Italian divisions in the east and one Italian division in the north. These troops often threaten the Italian lines of communication and launch surprise attacks from the rear of the Italian army. Amari, the main general under Siyoum, has apparently taken on the task of defending Dambian. Siyoum himself plans to join forces with General Gaza's troops. Amari is skilled in guerrilla warfare and can often conceal his troops so that they are not seen by Italian planes. The Italian army initially tried to encircle and penetrate the jungles of Dambian, but failed. Therefore, they are now launching a full-scale offensive, but the Ethiopian soldiers are familiar with the terrain, skilled in guerrilla warfare, and do not make direct contact.

The deliberative committee is chaired by Prime Minister Mussolini himself, and all cabinet members participate (the ministers of justice, education, and propaganda information have just joined). The various advisory committees were originally organized by the Chief of General Staff, the General Secretary of the Fascist Party, and the Chiefs of Staff of the Army, Navy, and Air Force.

<p>(Paris) Regarding the secret troop movements in Italy, reliable sources have reported that the troops stationed on the Italian-Austrian border must be returned to their original defensive positions for the winter. These troops, totaling 500,000, were transferred to the Brenner Pass on the Italian-Austrian border in August after the army's large-scale maneuvers. Now that winter has arrived, the climate in the area is harsh, and most of the troops are not accustomed to it, so it is necessary to transfer them away. As for the Italian-French border, the number of Italian troops stationed there remains the same as before, and there is no large concentration of troops. (30th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) Regarding the secret troop movements in Italy, this newspaper's reporter declares that there has been no increase in the number of Italian troops stationed on the French border. Only a few battalions of soldiers were previously transferred to other locations to participate in exercises, and have recently been returned to their original defenses. The current number of troops on the French border is not only no more than it was during the large-scale maneuvers in August of this year, but is actually less. For example, the "Cosselia Division" and the "Asieta Division" were ordered to go to the Libyan colony in Africa. So far, only the "Cosselia Division" has been transferred back to its original defenses, and the defensive positions left by the "Asieta Division" have not been fully filled. In addition, the government's newly formed motorized troop, the "Toranto Division," is not near the French border either. (1st Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>Addis Ababa: This newspaper's reporter, O. Chinate, reports that it is rumored that the Italian army has abandoned the Musa Ali Mountain position on the eastern route (between Italian Eritrea and French Somaliland). This news has not been confirmed by the Ethiopian government. Most people believe that the eastern route in the Wosa region has been quiet for a long time, and the Italian army has temporarily abandoned its plan to invade the area. This area is barren, sparsely populated, and has a harsh climate. Only the fierce Asseymara tribe, led by Chief Yayout, roams there. The chief has been appointed as the commander-in-chief of the eastern route by Ethiopian General Gaitatchu. The Asseymara tribe belongs to Islam, and does not obey the orders of other leaders except for the chief of their own religion, so they have not been formed into a formal army.

<p>Addis Ababa: This newspaper's reporter, O. Chinate, reports that according to observers here, there have been no troop movements or major offensives by the Ethiopian army in recent days to drive the Italian army out of the territory it has occupied. The government's public statement about the Italian army's retreat is probably due to climate or food supply issues. According to news from the city of Harar, the Ethiopian army has retaken Wal Wal (the source of the Italian-Ethiopian dispute). Residents of the city of Harar are becoming uneasy because they do not understand the Italian army's advance. Residents of the Ogaden province say that the Italian army on the southern route may abandon its plan to invade southern Harar province and instead attack the Bali and Sidamo regions in the west. The cessation of military action by the Italian army on the southern route is probably due to "Ramadan" (a Muslim holiday), because a large number of the residents of Italian Somaliland, the Ethiopian Ogaden province, and other provinces are Muslims.

<p>Leningrad: The Soviet Union recently crushed a large-scale spy organization. This organization was run by the Estonian Intelligence Group, and its founder was Geivisak, an agent of the group. Geivisak illegally entered Soviet territory. On September 19, the authorities in the Ratske County of the Pskov Province attempted to arrest Geivisak. Geivisak resisted with weapons and killed a messenger of the Pskov Provincial Office of the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs. In the resulting firefight, Geivisak was also killed. Two pistols, one hundred packs of ammunition, Estonian and Soviet currency, and a collection of espionage materials were found on his person. In connection with this case, several of Geivisak's subordinates were arrested in the Ratske District, the Luga District, and Leningrad, including five Estonian citizens of Soviet origin who directly assisted Geivisak. The spy ring was engaged in collecting classified documents of the Red Army and military police in the Leningrad, Luga, Novgorod, and Pskov provinces. The ring included Geivisak's relatives and wealthy White Guard peasants. They joined the ring when they were conscripted into the Red Army or served in the Red Army.

<p>(Berlin) The government has decided that December 7 will be "National Solidarity Responsibility Day." On that day, cabinet members of the central government, provincial officials, and senior officials of the National Socialist Party will separately collect donations on the streets to organize winter relief. Government officials held the same fundraising campaign last year on "National Peace and Tranquility Day," and the results were very good. At that time, Minister of Aviation and Prussian Governor-General Goering and Minister of Propaganda Goebbels both solicited donations from passersby on the streets. In Berlin alone, more than 500,000 marks were raised. (1st Havas Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e81">Moon Embracing (Part 1) <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Yuzhe</p>
<p>In ancient times, a person from the state of Qi worried that the sky would collapse and fall, to the point of neglecting sleep and forgetting meals. After someone explained the matter to him, he was somewhat relieved. We now always think we are much smarter than the ancients, and after reading Lie Yukou's great discussion, we certainly no longer engage in such pointless "Qi worries." However, recently various newspapers have published a news story about the moon about to fall to Earth, supposedly based on the opinion of a certain astronomer. As such, readers may find it hard not to believe.</p>
<p>Amidst this atmosphere of fear and suspicion, with the added threat of celestial phenomena on top of human affairs, it is truly unfortunate. Although we astronomers do not have the authority to force students back to school or order citizens to stop moving, we should help dispel the rumors and fulfill our national duty. Everyone surely believes that if the moon really did fall, we astronomers would find a way to help everyone, and there's no need to panic each other. When the time comes, we will certainly not lightly speak of sacrifice, but first, let's do this initial work of dispelling rumors.</p>
<p>Regarding the news of the moon falling, even if it is indeed a conversation by an astronomer and not just rumors in the newspapers, there is no need to take it too seriously. In fact, apart from solar eclipses, lunar eclipses, vernal equinoxes, autumnal equinoxes, and the like, the predictions of astronomers are not necessarily much better than those of street fortune-tellers. How do we know? We have Bai Juyi's poem as proof:</p>
<p>Human affairs are so varied, what is there to be surprised about?</p>
<p>Even celestial phenomena, though considered reliable, are still often wrong.</p>
<p>The moon leaves the constellation of Bi, promising heavy rain,</p>
<p>But sometimes it doesn't rain; who can predict it?</p>
<p>For those who believe in the past and doubt the present, we can more easily prove that the moon falling is nothing to fear. In Zhang Zai's "Western Inscription," there is the phrase "Heaven calls itself Father, Earth calls itself Mother," which shows that the Earth is truly the mother of all things. There is no need to search for the word "Mother Earth" only in crab-walking literature. The Jade Rabbit is the most common name for the moon. As the name suggests, if the moon falls, and we were to describe it in the style of vernacular poetry, wouldn't we call it a white rabbit throwing itself into its mother's embrace? What a tender and loving scene this painting would depict! Everyone not only has no need to panic about this, but if they believe in auspicious omens, they should regard this as a celebratory omen. In the "Records of the Three Kingdoms," didn't Lady Wu dream of the moon entering her womb and then gave birth to Sun Ce? If a vague deer dream is already so effective, then if the bright moon truly throws itself into your embrace, the hero born in response to this auspicious sign will surely have a career far surpassing that of Sun Ce, who could only carve out a territory in Jiangdong.</p>
<p>Speaking of "Earth calling itself Mother," the phrase "Earth is the mother" is most appropriate when referring to the moon. If humans are not created by God, they must be born of parents. If the sun, moon, and stars are not created by God, then the sun, moon, and stars must also have their own parents. The difference is that human lifespans are exceptionally short, and we can trace back several generations. The lifespan of the sun, moon, and stars, compared to human lifespans, is far more than that of the giant *chun* tree, which considers five thousand years as spring and five thousand years as autumn, standing side-by-side with the ephemeral mayfly that lives for a single day. Therefore, the circumstances of their birth are already shrouded in the thick fog of a distant, ancient past. However, based on astronomical observations and the application of mathematical and physical principles, we can still find some clues to follow. But to trace back further, while scholars of astronomy and mathematics are unwilling to admit that they have reached the limit of their abilities, listeners cannot help but feel lost in a dense fog. Regarding the formation of the Earth and other planets in the solar system, the binary theory is currently the most dominant. Apart from lower animals like amoebas that can divide themselves to reproduce asexually, all other animals must rely on the cooperation of their parents to produce offspring. The sun's family is only able to have these nine major planets because, in the past, it must have met another sun (that is, a fixed star) and had a fleeting encounter, resulting in a temporary union. From the current situation where the sun is still working hard to nurture and raise these nine children, the sun is clearly an unfortunate abandoned woman. And that ungrateful and heartless stellar father has probably fled to the depths of the Milky Way to form a binary star again, and we have no way to pursue the matter further.</p>
<p>After all, there is a difference between the celestial and human realms. The circumstances of the sun giving birth must have been a magnificent sight. The power of the sun and moon is enough to cause huge tides on the surface of the Earth and in the oceans. When that enormous, unparalleled stellar father passed shoulder-to-shoulder with the sun, there must also have been an exceptionally unusual tidal force. Moreover, the sun is a hot ball of gas, unlike the Earth, which is so calm and stable. Therefore, the tides stirred up on the sun at that time were simply a torrent of surging hot liquid, shooting into the sky. This substance, thin at both ends and bulging in the middle, was subject to the gravitational pull of both the stellar father and the sun, and it broke apart to become these planets, orbiting the sun. At the same time, while the planets were still in an unsolidified state, they were influenced by the gravitational pull of other planets and the sun, and in the same way, they also produced many satellites. If the planets are the children of the sun, then the satellites are the grandchildren of the sun. However, the method of reproduction in the celestial realm is to give birth to sons and hold grandchildren at the same time, which can never be achieved in the human world.</p>

<p>Peiping correspondence: The situation in North China seemed to ease slightly on the 28th and 29th, but it is still difficult to be optimistic. Song Zheyuan, the commander of the Peiping-Tianjin Garrison, expressed his humble refusal to accept the new post of Pacification Commissioner of Hebei-Chahar-Suiyuan to He Yingqin in a telegram. He immediately replied with a telegram of consolation. On the evening of the 28th, Song convened Qin Dechun, Xiao Zhenying, and others at his private residence in Wuyi Ku Hutong to discuss ways to seek stability in the current situation. He re-telegraphed He, earnestly requesting him to forward the message to the Central Government to withdraw the order. At the same time, he dispatched Liu Jialuan, a staff officer of the Peiping-Tianjin Garrison Headquarters, to Baoding as a representative to meet with Shang Zhen, the chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, urging Shang to come to Peiping immediately to discuss major plans. Liu also left Peiping southward that evening by the Peiping-Hankou train.</p>
<p>After returning to Taiyuan from Nanjing, Yan Xishan, the Pacification Commissioner of Taiyuan, telegraphed Fu Zuoyi, the chairman of the Suiyuan Provincial Government, and Xu Yongchang, the chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Government, to come to Taiyuan for discussions. Fu has already arrived in Taiyuan from Suiyuan. Xu, who was recuperating in Peiping, has recovered and also left Peiping on the night of the 28th to return to Shanxi. Song Zheyuan, Xiao Zhenying, Qin Dechun, and others went to see him off. It is reported that after Xu arrived in Taiyuan, in addition to reporting his recovery to Yan, he will also report on the recent situation in Hebei and the measures taken by the authorities. Xu is expected to come to Peiping again in the middle of next month.</p>
<p>A unit of Japanese troops, on the evening of the 28th, traveled in more than 40 large automobiles from Luanping to Gubeikou, disembarking on the east and west sides of the river and stationed in pre-designated civilian houses. The number of Japanese troops arriving this time was no more than two or three hundred, but the Japanese side claimed 500. It was also said that the Gubeikou area was insufficient for the Japanese troops to garrison, and the troops arriving later would live in the Shixia and Miyun areas. In addition, the Japanese troops newly arrived at Gubeikou from outside the pass have reached 1,000 artillery soldiers and 800 infantry soldiers. Although they claimed that they would advance south to Miyun and Huairou, they have not yet moved. The situation within the boundaries of Huairou and Miyun counties is still peaceful. More than 500 Japanese troops, who arrived at various passes along the Great Wall from units such as the Independent Mixed Brigade stationed in Rehe-Chifeng area, are busy running around by car every day. The Japanese troops originally stationed at Saheqiao had already moved to Zunhua and other counties on the 26th. One battalion of Japanese troops originally stationed in Dongling has gone to Xinglong and Malan airfield. There are many Japanese planes parked at the airfield, and they fly to various counties inside the pass every day for reconnaissance.</p>
<p>More than 100 Japanese soldiers went to the Fengtai and Guang'anmen railway stations on the 27th, claiming to monitor traffic. After negotiations between the Peiping authorities and the Japanese side, 80 Japanese soldiers withdrew from Fengtai at 9:45 a.m. on the 28th and returned to the Peiping barracks. The remaining ten or so soldiers stayed in Fengtai to guard the station. The Japanese soldiers at Guang'anmen railway station also withdrew entirely by car back to the Peiping Japanese barracks at 8:40 a.m. that morning. There were rumors that there were also Japanese soldiers in Changxindian. It was investigated that on the morning of the 27th, two Japanese people in plainclothes went to the station to inquire about traffic conditions and then left immediately. There were no Japanese troops going there. As for the Peiping-Liaoning, Peiping-Hankou, and Peiping-Suiyuan railways, passenger and freight trains operated as usual on the 28th.</p>
<p>Cheng Ke, the mayor of Tianjin, came to Peiping to visit Song Zheyuan, the commander of the Peiping-Tianjin Garrison, and discussed matters concerning Tianjin's security, the security team, and police command. According to Cheng, "The activities of the ignorant people in Tianjin have now been quelled. Several of the ringleaders have reportedly been sent outside the pass. However, the crisis still exists. Before I came to Peiping, I and Director Liu (Yushu) had made thorough arrangements for security. There should be no problems in the next three to five days. If the central government does not have a proper solution after that, I will feel extremely uneasy. The Japanese troops in Tianjin are building an airfield in Dongjuzi, which can accommodate many planes. It is said that 50 Japanese planes will fly to Tianjin and increase air force equipment. The Japanese side claims that this is an exercise, but the scale is larger than previous ones. The Japanese troops interfered with railway affairs at Tianjin-Pukou Railway Station. After I negotiated with the Japanese side, the misunderstanding has been cleared up, so traffic has not been obstructed. I came to Peiping to visit Commander Song to discuss ways to maintain Tianjin's security. In the future, I will be responsible for diplomacy, while Song will be responsible for security. Dividing the work and cooperating will be better than having one person responsible for everything alone." (November 29)</p>

You are sitting in Peiping and Tianjin, the key to the northern gate, and you have an unshirkable responsibility to protect the territory. We urge you to exert all your efforts to quickly quell the rebellion, and we hope you will not have any reservations. If you leave endless troubles, all our citizens will share the same hatred and stand together as a backup, not hesitating to make any sacrifices. We make this urgent appeal, hoping you will consider it." Wuhan press collectively kowtows. (3) Telegram to colleagues and compatriots across the country: "To colleagues across the country and compatriots across the country, the nation is unfortunately facing continuous rebellions.

<h3 id="e96">Kong Xiangrong Talks About the Dongzhuang Dike Closing Problem Materials to be Transported Within a Month Dam to be Closed Next Spring Light Railway of 20 Li to be Laid for Earth Transport <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Jinan correspondence: Regarding the Dongzhuang Yellow River dike closing project, it has been approved by the National Economic Commission and transferred from the provincial dike closing work committee to the Yellow River Conservancy Commission for continued handling. Kong Xiangrong, the acting chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, is currently in Jinan and is in close contact with the dike closing work committee to handle the transfer procedures. According to him, regarding the transfer of the Dongzhuang Yellow River dike closing project to the commission, Provincial Director Zhang Honglie had repeatedly pleaded with him beforehand, stating the real situation that he could not go to the worksite to command. It was not until 10:00 p.m. yesterday (the 28th) that he received the telegram from the Economic Commission relayed from Kaifeng ordering the acceptance of the project. The commission and the local authorities have always had a harmonious relationship, and all contacts have been open and honest. Since the Yellow River breach, Chairman Han and Director Zhang have planned day and night for dike closing and disaster relief, and resettlement of disaster victims, sparing no effort, which is admirable. However, Chairman Han and Director Zhang are busy with government affairs and cannot go to the worksite to command. He, as the person responsible for Yellow River management, has an unshirkable duty for the dike closing project. However, the dike closing project is huge and still requires local assistance and joint efforts. After the commission takes over, it will continue according to the original plan. The materials can only be checked and accepted according to the actual existing quantity to ensure that the project is not interrupted for a single day. A detailed handover book must be created later. As for whether there will be any changes in the engineering office, it is still not possible to determine at present. He must personally go to the worksite to inspect before studying it. However, the project is important, and the current director is Director Zhang (Lianjia) of the River Affairs Bureau, who has been very hardworking in the past. The River Affairs Bureau will still be asked to assist in the future. The current Yellow River water situation has reached the level of the entire river vying for the flow. The Jiangsus dam leading flow project is important, and it is planned to concentrate efforts to complete this project, recover part of the main flow, reduce the flood water, so that the flood water only flows into the already scoured trough, does not overflow, and reduces the disaster area. At a minimum, we will first provide relief to some of the disaster victims. The new dam foundation will also be carried out at the same time. Materials are the main items for the project. According to the original plan for the entire project, there are 17,000 cubic meters of stone and 6,000 stacks of straw. Currently, 5,000 cubic meters of stone have arrived at the worksite. In addition to the 1,000 cubic meters that have been used, more than 12,000 cubic meters are still needed. About 1,000 stacks of straw have arrived at the worksite, and more than 4,000 stacks are still needed. The transport of earth is even more difficult. There is no surplus at the worksite. Once the weather turns cold, it will be difficult to extract soil, and frozen soil is not suitable for the project. It is necessary to concentrate efforts and actively transport the soil, aiming to transport all the materials within a month, so that the dam can be closed next spring and not delay spring plowing, because the Economic Commission originally set a deadline for closing the dam in April. Although closing the dam before the ice flood is ahead of schedule, it is difficult to ensure solidity when working in winter, and the scouring force of the ice flood is great, so there will be losses. For material transport, on the one hand, increase the number of large boats hired in Henan and Hebei, designating them to transport stone and straw separately, and designate the allocated trains to be dedicated to transporting stone. For the transport of other materials, please temporarily allocate vehicles to avoid delaying the transport of stone. The straw will be entrusted to the counties along the river in Shandong, Henan, and Hebei to purchase quickly. On the other hand, plan to lay a light railway track on both banks of the new river to transport earth. It is planned to set up one round-trip road on each bank, about four or five *hua li* long, so that new soil can be extracted. A total of ten to twenty *li* of track can be used. Also, raise dozens of dump trucks for transportation back and forth to pile up the soil at the worksite for temporary use. As for the problem of mortgaging 3 million disaster relief bonds, it is also planned to quickly find a way to mortgage them for cash to meet urgent needs. He plans to return to Kaifeng to inspect Dongzhuang once after discussing the handover method with Chairman Han and Director Zhang today, arrange the project affairs properly, and then go to Nanjing to report and negotiate everything mentioned above. After completing the work, he will return to Dongzhuang and stay at the worksite permanently to supervise the progress. The dike closing meeting will be set up in Dongzhuang in order to facilitate matters. The project cost budget will remain the same for the time being, but we will strive to save money when it is actually used, so that the funds will not be wasted.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Recent Developments in Southern Jiangxi Construction Yu Hanmou's Report on Returning to Guangdong <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou correspondence: The current situation is serious, and the defenses are extremely important. In order to understand the defenses of the troops stationed in various places, Chen Jitang convened the army commanders, division commanders, and brigade commanders of his troops back to the province to consult on everything. Those who have returned to the province in recent days include division commanders Zhang Ruigui, Ye Zhao, Huang Zhiwen, Deng Longguang, and Li Hanhun. Around the 20th, Li Yangjing, the commander of the Third Army, and Yu Hanmou, the commander of the First Army, also returned to the province from their defense areas successively. Meetings were held starting on the 23rd, and discussions were held on the equipment for naval, air, and land defense, the distribution of troops, the reorganization of national defense fortresses, and the progress of pacification. A complete plan was drawn up. On the 25th, Yu Hanmou, the commander of the First Army, reported on the recent situation of pacification and construction in southern Jiangxi at the weekly memorial service of the Southwest Political Affairs Council, stating that after Zhu Mao's communist bandits fled westward, the First Army sent teams to pacify southern Jiangxi. The remnants of the bandits were gradually cleared. Until September of this year, the Southern Jiangxi Pacification Commissioner's Office was ordered to be abolished. Until recently, a small group of bandits was discovered on the Hunan border, and Peng, the commander of the First Division, was sent with troops to suppress them. According to recent reports, the bandit group has been dispersed, and more than 20 hostages have been rescued. He inspected the local situation in the Xinfeng and Anyuan areas at the beginning of the month and saw that the countryside was gradually recovering, and most of the wasteland had been cultivated. When the communist bandits fled, there was often panic about food in southern Jiangxi. Because the farmland has been harvested, there is no need to worry about lack of food. However, in order to prevent poor harvests, we have promoted winter plowing, built warehouses, and stored grain to prepare for lean years. After the bandit disaster in the three southern counties, the schools were closed, and the people's wisdom was backward. Recently, the First Rural Normal School was established in Dayu, and the Second Rural Normal School was established in Longnan. One class of students from the First Rural Normal School graduated this spring and were assigned to various townships to run civilian schools and primary schools. As for the construction of highways, it is the main construction of the area. The highways from Xunwu and Longchuan to Pingyuan, Dingnan to Heping, and Qiannan to Wengyuan have been built and opened to traffic. As for the roads from Xinfeng to Anyuan and Xinfeng to Longnan, they are still under construction. The Shuiche Bridge in Xinfeng and the Jing'an Bridge in Dayu are temporarily built with wood due to limited funds. Dayu has recently opened two new urban areas and built a bus terminal for the Gan-Yu-Xiong-Sou highways. The Commemorative Monument for Suppressing Bandits and the Martyrs' Cemetery and Martyrs' Shrine for the Fallen Soldiers in Suppressing Bandits have also been built. As for the financial aspects, southern Jiangxi is originally poor, and the money supply is not very abundant. Since the Central Government announced the use of legal currency, silver dollars have been gradually withdrawn, but prices are higher than before." (November 26)</p>

<p>In our county, various silk factories are closing down one after another due to the rising price of dried cocoons and the shortage of raw materials. In addition to the five factories of Yonghua, Baisi, Wanchang, Xinchang, and Yichang, which have been closed for a long time, another five factories, including Heji, Yuanfongsheng, Xinda, Minsheng, and Gongda, have been forced to close down in the past half month. However, the Minsheng and Gongda factories have been in a stalemate due to labor-capital disputes arising from the distribution of bonuses. Recently, the overseas silk market has turned sluggish, and the price of high-quality white silk has fallen to 730-740 yuan per package. The market price of dried cocoons has also fallen from 225 yuan per dan to 180 yuan. The future of the silk market seems to be returning to a gloomy state.</p>

Up to now, all preparations have been completed, and the branch was officially established on December 1st.

<p>Meat merchants in Jiaxing have been detained by the county magistrate for failing to pay the additional slaughter tax, and it has been many days now without their release. The county chamber of commerce has repeatedly petitioned the county to change the additional tax to 50% and to release the detained meat merchants first. After the county government received the petition, it stated that the 65% additional tax has been included in this year's budget and cannot be reduced in any way. Since the tax is collected from the local people and used for local purposes, they should actively pay it. Why should they resist with excuses? Moreover, the additional tax is actually collected from the buyers, and the meat merchants are only responsible for collecting it on their behalf. They must wait until the tax is paid in full before they can be released. The request is temporarily rejected.</p>

<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, after the Central, China, and Communications Banks were ordered by the Ministry of Finance to handle interbank overdrafts to relieve industry and commerce, silver and money businesses can borrow from the three banks in accordance with the regulations set by the Ministry. The money business will receive vouchers after the representatives' standing committee approves it today. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Three Banks Ordered: After the Central, China, and Communications Banks were ordered, they decided to handle interbank overdrafts in accordance with the method of interbank lending during the closing of accounts in 1934 and at the end of April 1935. Xi Demao, Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, Bei Songsun, Manager of the Shanghai Branch of the China Bank, and Zhang Peishen, Manager of the Business Bureau of the Communications Bank, jointly decided that the Business Bureau of the Central Bank will be responsible for the overdraft. The total amount of the overdraft will be determined according to market needs, and the three banks will share the amount according to the 4-4-2 system. The daily interbank interest rate will be announced daily, but it will be slightly lower than the ordinary rate. Although its direct purpose is to assist silver and money businesses, it is indirectly to relieve industry and commerce.</p>
<p>Two Businesses Comply: After the Ministry of Finance approved silver and money businesses to receive legal tender from the Central, China, and Communications Banks with 60% cash and 40% reserves, member banks of the Banking Association have complied one after another. Member shops of the Money Business Association have decided to send reserves to the United Reserve Bank in accordance with the resolution of the Executive Committee of the Association, and the cash previously paid to the three banks will be issued by the Bank to the three banks, and it is scheduled to hold a meeting of members' representatives at the Association on Ningbo Road at 2:00 PM today.

Li Jingcong specifically summoned the seven students at the company at 9:00 AM yesterday morning and gave a speech, stating that even though the company's current operations are sluggish and funding is difficult, it still spared no effort to send you abroad for advanced studies, because at a time when the country is in serious trouble, it is not enough to revive the nation unless we adhere to the Prime Minister's aim of saving the country through aviation, and saving the country through aviation requires specialized technical talents to be useful. You have all served in the domestic aviation industry for many years, and you have also witnessed the various stimuli given to us by others. This time, when you go abroad to study, you must earnestly adhere to this aim, pay special attention to your studies, and seek further studies, so as to complete your mission. As for the current diplomatic situation in our country, it is changing rapidly, but no matter how urgent it is, there are executives and patriotic heroes who will deal with it. With our country's long history, vast land, abundant resources, and many talents, we will never suffer the disaster of momentary destruction. When you study abroad, even if you occasionally get some news, you must not let your studies be deeply affected by righteous indignation, and you must still hold the aim of taking responsibility for the country in the future and concentrate on achieving something. This is what I earnestly hope from you. It is heard that the members are expected to arrive in Berlin on the 21st of this month.</p>

<p>According to the Mainland News, Mr. Manley, an official of the Washington office of the Chicago Tribune, who went to Manila to participate in the founding ceremony of the new Philippine Republic, has arrived in Shanghai and talked to a reporter from the Mainland News about Philippine affairs, much of which is unheard of by people in Shanghai. It is said that in the days before the election in the Philippines, the situation in Manila was very tense. It was rumored that the defeated presidential candidate, Mr. Oquinaldo, would launch a rebellion. Oquinaldo had initially engaged in fraudulent activities in the election. According to insiders, the American Governor-General Murphy visited Oquinaldo the day before the ceremony and asked him if he was going to do anything. Oquinaldo told Murphy that he planned to lead 60,000 of his followers into Manila on the day of the ceremony. Oquinaldo was very popular among civil servants and received 200,000 votes in this election, while Quezon received 800,000 votes. Murphy advised Oquinaldo not to take any rash actions that would damage the reputation of the Philippines, which would be unwise from various standpoints. Oquinaldo followed his advice and did not take any action. This statement seems quite credible, because no incident occurred afterwards, and Oquinaldo did not even attend the ceremony. Another thing is also quite relevant, that is, Quezon slept on the American cruiser the night before taking office as president. Mr. Manley believes that the departure of the American congressional delegation from Manila has raised doubts about whether the Philippine Republic's plan will succeed in the future. Most members of Congress feel that the United States will return to the Philippines or completely abandon it within a few years. American merchants are strongly opposed to allowing the Philippines to become independent, while American farmers are more in favor of it because their products can reduce competition. As for the average Filipinos, most of them do not know the meaning of independence, and politicians naturally support the Republican plan. However, Filipino businessmen are quite worried about the future. Filipinos must survive on the basis of preferential tax rates. At first, it was thought that preferential trade agreements could be concluded with various countries, including the United States, but now it seems difficult for these trade agreements to become a reality, so the economic life of the Philippines will be greatly distressed. The public does not express any fear about the security of the Philippines, especially against Japan. However, the public believes that the United States will come forward to protect the Philippines when it needs help. Quezon once said that he planned to train an army to prevent troublemakers from daring to take advantage. The size of the army is set at 19,000 people. You can decide for yourselves how effective this army will be. Mr. Manley is currently staying at the American Association and plans to go to Japan in the next few days for a short stay, and then plans to return to his country. Mr. Manley is a graduate of the journalism department of the University of Missouri.</p>

<p>Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, in order to promote the overseas trade of national goods, requested Song Consul-General to ask the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to establish a Chinese Pavilion on his return to China through the Federation of Chinese Chambers of Commerce. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce entertained Song Consul-General the night before last to discuss concrete measures. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce replied to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, urging it to find ways to develop trade with Nanyang. The original letter stated, "According to the report of the Federation of Chinese Chambers of Commerce in the Dutch East Indies, the Singapore Chinese National Goods Exhibition this year was well received by overseas Chinese. The Shanghai National Goods Manufacturers Delegation plans to hold a traveling exhibition in various parts of Nanyang in April next year to expand the sales of national goods in Nanyang. The Association plans to build a Chinese Pavilion in Kanpu, Batavia, Netherlands, to hold a national goods exhibition during the night market there in August next year. However, this matter requires national goods manufacturers to jointly raise funds before it can be successful. Now, please ask Song Consul-General to take the opportunity to return to China to represent the liaison and ask him to inform well-known manufacturers to handle the liaison. The matter concerns the development of trade with Nanyang, so this letter is specially conveyed. Please investigate, convene various national goods manufacturers' groups, and consult with Song Consul-General to handle the matter effectively."</p>

<p>Liu Hangchen, Director of the Finance Department of Sichuan Province, came east from Sichuan to Shanghai to meet with Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi to report on the financial situation of Sichuan Province and the financial situation of Sichuan Province after the implementation of the currency reform policy. At the same time, for the sake of reorganizing the finances of Sichuan Province, he specially used the Sichuan Post-Rehabilitation Public Bonds to mortgage a loan of 12 million yuan from the Central Bank as a means of recovering the public receipts that circulated in Chongqing but were not redeemable, which amounted to approximately 12 to 13 million yuan. After Mr. Liu visited Minister Kong in Shanghai several times to explain the details, Minister Kong agreed to allocate the loan. A Xin Xin News Agency reporter interviewed Director Liu last night. According to him, the results of this trip to the east were quite satisfactory and the matter has been completed. He has decided to take the early express train to Beijing tomorrow morning (i.e., this morning) and then return to Sichuan.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Customs Exempts Dredging Tax: Directly Reduces the Burden on Domestic Merchants and Indirectly Helps Increase Exported Goods <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>According to the National News Agency, the dredging tax has always been collected by the Customs, i.e., 3 taels are added to every 100 taels of customs tax, and tax-exempt goods are subject to a levy of 1 tael and 5 mace per 10 taels of value. The Director of the Shanghai Dredging Bureau believes that at a time when southern industries are declining and the government is showing concern for merchants' difficulties, customs duties on exported domestic goods are being considered for separate reductions and exemptions, while this tax is still being collected as usual, which is contrary to the government's good intentions. Furthermore, the dredging project was originally intended to develop port affairs, and the decline of local goods is particularly important to the future of port affairs. Therefore, exempting this tax would directly reduce the burden on domestic merchants and encourage the increase of exported goods, while indirectly seeking the development of port affairs. He submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance to exempt all tax-exempt exported goods and domestic goods exported in the future from dredging tax for a trial period of one year to observe the results. This has been approved by the Ministry of Finance and instructed the Jianghai Customs to comply accordingly.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Association for Fundraising for Flood Relief in Various Provinces received a telegram yesterday from Cheng Jingsheng, the Director of Relief Investigation in Jiangsu Province, which reads as follows: "The Shanghai Renji Hall Association for Flood Relief in Various Provinces, President Kong, Vice Presidents Xu, Wang, Wu, Ye, and Wang, and all committee members and chief secretaries: The counties in the Hai District affected by the disaster, after assisting Relief Commissioners in separate investigations at Zhouji, Lianshui, turned to the Shuhai two counties and traversed the disaster areas. After traveling by boat and car, they arrived in Donghai County on the 12th and then went to Guanyun for two days. Jingsheng returned to Que on the 12th and reported. Then, on the 19th, he took the Pinghu train to Xu and then transferred to the Longhai train to Dong, where he met with Commissioner Hao and inspected the Xinpu area, and discussed in detail with the gentry and relief workers of the three counties of Shudong and Guan. On the 23rd, on the way back from Hainan, passing through the Tong District, he saw that the water level in Pei County continued to rise and the disaster situation was expanding tragically, only second to Pi County, which was deeply saddened. Based on the current living conditions of the disaster victims, a distinction is made. The Huai District is the most severely affected by Su, followed by Si, followed by Lian; the Hai District is the most severely affected by Shu, followed by Hai, followed by Guan. To sum up the disaster situation in the six counties of the two districts, if expressed as a percentage, then in the Huaiyin District, Suqian accounts for 62%, Siyang accounts for 21%, and Lianshui accounts for 17%; in the Donghai District, Shuyang accounts for 51%, Donghai accounts for 34%, and Guanyun accounts for 15%. If we further integrate the Tong District, according to what Jingsheng has observed, the water-affected area and the population of disaster victims in each county are not accurate standards for Shi Chen, because the previous living conditions were different in terms of wealth and poverty, and after this disaster, there were further distinctions between whether or not the stored grain was washed away, or even the land was originally poor and there was no harvest to speak of in good years, although the population was large, there were still ways to survive for a while, and although the region was vast, relief did not necessarily require a large amount, on the contrary, the scope was narrow, or it should be increased. Now, for the ten counties in the three districts of Tonghai and Huai in this province, the winter relief budget percentage table is formulated separately according to the severity of the situation, which was submitted to the Provincial Relief Association meeting today (yesterday) and passed for implementation. However, the disaster situation is severe, the water level is still rising, and the allocation of relief funds and supplies is extremely difficult to save, which is deeply regrettable. If you are merciful, please allocate additional funds besides the spring construction relief funds, which is what we pray for. Standing Director Cheng Jingsheng, Director of Disaster Relief in Jiangsu Province, bows."</p>

<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications has an underwater telephone line between Gaochang Temple Jiangnan Shipyard and Zhoujiadu in Pudong to connect telephone services in Pudong, Nanshi, Zhabei, and other places. A Xin Sheng News Agency reporter happened to meet Yu Bingjian, the chief engineer of the bureau, by the river in Gaochang Temple yesterday morning and learned that the above-mentioned underwater line had been damaged by the anchor of the British merchant ship Moller &amp; Co. Moller Doisy a few days ago. Although the bureau's underwater line watchman discovered and stopped it immediately, the entire line had been damaged in many places, so telephone services could not operate as usual. Currently, Engineers Gao and Wu are supervising all employees to hire ships and barges to start replacing the new line, which will take about two or three days to complete. The Jianghai Customs and the shipping company have been notified for investigation so that negotiations for compensation for losses can be carried out.</p>

<h3 id="e135">The Monologue Improvement Association Discusses and Decides on Four Prohibitions and Two Requirements Yesterday <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai News Agency, comic monologues are a newly emerging art form with a history of only a few decades. The actors engaged in this art form have also been neglected by society. However, because the content and organization of this art form are extremely simple, and the singing is as humorous as possible, it is quite popular among the public. In recent years, it has become extremely popular. Such as the late Wang Wuneng, and the current Jiang Xiaoxiao, Liu Chunshan, Zhuang Yanghua, Lu Qiqi, Zhao Xixi, Cheng Xiaoting, etc. broadcasting on various radio stations, almost all citizens of the city know about them. From this, it can be seen that the power of this art form has penetrated into the people. Pan, the director of the Municipal Education Bureau, wants to use this art form as a tool to promote social education, and specially sent Ding Shoutang, the drama and song record review committee member of the bureau, to lead the city's monologue actors to organize the Shanghai Comic Monologue Research Association. Ding himself served as the executive director, which can not only increase the status of monologue actors in society, but also enable all actors to earnestly improve their lyrics, so as to achieve the effect of imperceptible influence. Yesterday was the seventh regular meeting of the association. It is learned that there are four prohibitions and two musts in the important resolutions. The four prohibitions are to eliminate negative effects. The six specific methods for improving monologues are determined to improve the content of monologues to assist social education. All members of the Shanghai Comic Monologue Research Association should abide by them. If there is any violation, it will be reported to the Municipal Education Bureau for severe punishment. (1) It is not allowed to sing or perform obscene words and sentences, such as "軋姘頭" (having an affair), "吊膀子" (flirting), etc., and actions related to public morals. (2) It is not allowed to have abusive sentences, such as "赤老" (old fart), "觸　娘" (cursing someone's mother), "癟三" (bum), etc. (3) It is not allowed to sing sad tunes, such as crying for Wang Wuneng, Ding Guai Guai, and Sun Yat-sen. (4) It is not allowed to sing or perform words and tunes that the authorities have already banned, such as imitating "毛毛雨" (drizzle), "桃花江調" (Peach Blossom River tune), and the grass skirt dance, etc. B. Two necessities in the active aspect: (1) All members, whether performing on stage or at radio stations, must insert a section of singing with social benefits and educational significance in each performance or broadcast. (2) All members must completely copy the lyrics into a book and submit them to the Education Bureau for review.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Residents of Sidali on Shigaota Road Demand Rent Reduction <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Since last year, due to the economic downturn, houses along North Sichuan Road Shigaota Road have been successively reducing rents. This time, the tenants of Sidali on Shigaota Road were frightened by the rumors and panic, and the timid ones moved away one after another. Although the rumors have subsided recently, the residents are like frightened birds, and new tenants who want to inquire about the area next to the headquarters of the Japanese Marines have a sense of caution. Therefore, the area has become a bleak scene. It is estimated that less than a quarter of the tenants in the entire area are currently living there. Recently, they have united to ask the landlord to waive the rent for November and December of this year and to reduce the rent by half starting from January next year. It is heard that the landlord of this area has always had a good income, and this time he has also shown conscience, sympathized with the difficulties of the times, and is happy to accept the tenant's request. The document of the tenants of this area requesting the landlord Hengli Company is copied as follows: "Respectful greetings, since last year, the market has been in decline, and landlords everywhere who are considerate of the difficulties of the times have automatically reduced rents to ease the plight of tenants. We have been busy with our duties and have not had time to negotiate with your landlord, and have paid the rent as usual every month, in the hope that your landlord would realize it himself, but your landlord has turned a deaf ear, procrastinating until now, with no expression of sympathy. Now that rumors have arisen, and people have moved away from the empty alleys, the once prosperous area has suddenly become a remote village, with few lights and little smoke, a desolate scene, and it is felt that restoration is difficult. The losses we have suffered are equal to those of a disaster. In the past, we were able to barely support ourselves by subletting to others to make up for the losses, but now nine out of ten rooms are empty, and no one cares about the rest. It is even more difficult to bear the burden alone. We and your landlord have been guests and hosts for many years, interdependent, and we have never followed the trend to make things difficult for the landlord. At this critical time, we have to discuss ways to save the future. It has now been decided to ask your landlord to waive the rent for November and December of this year, and to reduce the rent by half starting from January until the city returns to its original state. This method is not an excessive request. It is believed that your landlord is aware of the times and will resolutely agree, without the need to bargain back and forth, and the time will be delayed, and both parties will suffer losses. Please reply in writing within ten days, and please send a letter to the Finance Bureau to handle the housing donation in proportion. We will pay the rent on time after receiving your reply. The matter concerns maintaining the overall situation of the market, and your landlord has an inescapable duty. Please send the letter to the temporary office of the Tenants Association in this area. Sincerely, the Tenants of Sidali."</p>

<h3 id="e141">A Prostitute Pulled on a Man's Clothes at the Amusement Park: To His Surprise, It Was His Niece. The Uncle Reported It to the Police, Who Arrested the Brothel Owner and Took Her Home, Leading to Another Dispute <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Liu Ziming, a native of Huaiyin who lives at 70 Wu Jiaheng, Pudong, and works at a British-American cigarette factory, went to the Xianshi Company amusement park to play at 8 PM on the 24th of this month. Suddenly, a young prostitute pulled on his clothes. Liu turned around and was surprised to see that it was his niece. He questioned her why she had come to this point. According to the prostitute, she was sold to a Wu family by her parents and then resold by Wu to a brothel opened by Dai Chunyang at Dakou Bridge in the Shanghai British Concession to become a prostitute. She received a price of 360 yuan and has been receiving customers for five or six months, earning 5 to 6 yuan per night. Feeling sorry for his niece and considering that she was not yet an adult, the brothel owner forced her to receive customers, which was too cruel. He reported it to the police station, and the madam and the girl were taken to the police station together. The next morning, they were transferred to the First Court of the Special District, and Liu was instructed to take her back. Yesterday afternoon, Liu's wife, Li (who is the girl's biological mother), suddenly brought three people who looked like detectives to Liu's house, forcing Liu to return the prostitute and threatening him with lies. Seeing the situation was not good, Liu urgently reported it to the police for investigation. The three people who looked like detectives took the opportunity to escape. Liu and his sister-in-law Li, along with the prostitute Liu Jun, were taken to the Pudong Branch Bureau. First, Liu reported the situation of his niece's rescue. According to Li, because her husband was suffering from madness and she was forced by economic reasons, she mortgaged her own daughter to Dai Chunyang, obtaining 200 yuan, and it was stated at that time that she would learn to dance, not to be a prostitute. Now she intends to send her daughter back to Dai to learn to dance, etc. According to Liu Jun, she is 13 years old and her stage name is Mei Lanfang. In the past, because her mother owed Dai money, she was forced to mortgage me, stating that I would learn to dance, but I didn't expect Dai to ask me to receive customers at the amusement park every day. I have received 20 to 30 people, earning more than 100 yuan in nighttime fees, etc. The director checked the statements and found that Li's claim that she still intended to send her daughter back to Liu to learn to dance clearly showed that she still wanted to cruelly push her daughter into the fire pit, which was too inhumane. He immediately ordered them to be sent to the General Bureau for further investigation.</p>

He is currently staying at the Donghe Foreign Firm. On the 28th of the previous day, he specially fasted and bathed to divine the hexagram for Shanghai. The hexagram is "The Hexagram of Benefit from Wind and Thunder, the Family of Wind and Fire". According to this hexagram, the situation in Shanghai next year will be like young men and women, whose love is overflowing, and they will have a son. Therefore, it is predicted that although the market will be slightly depressed in January and February next year, from March to August, the market will be prosperous, and small retail merchants will be especially successful. However, the hexagram of the Family of Wind and Fire should be wary of excessive spending.</p>

<p>Yin Guangzhao, a native of Tongzhou who lives at 169 Yangjiazhaizi in Pudong, recently had a whimsical idea to steal maggots from the corpses in broken coffins, claiming that they could cure all diseases. The matter was discovered by the police station in charge. Considering that Yin's behavior was inhumane, Yin was arrested and two bottles of maggots were seized. He was sent to the prosecutor's office of the local court for interrogation and detention. It is learned that the case has been investigated by the prosecutor and a public prosecution has been filed. In the afternoon of the previous day, Judge Tan Zhuohong held a court hearing. According to Yin Guangzhao, a friend entrusted me to find corpse maggots. He gave me one yuan for travel expenses, and I did not sell the corpse maggots for money. After the statement was completed, he knelt down and begged for forgiveness. The interrogator then announced in court that Yin Guangzhao was sentenced to one year of imprisonment for fraud. Yin lowered his head in silence after the sentence and was taken back to the prison by the bailiff.</p>

<h3 id="e150">Yarn Mill King's Scandal with Famous Socialite: A Tragedy Amidst Industrial and Commercial Decline, a Change in the Battle Between Golden Women <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Miss Zhou is the niece of General Li, who is currently in retirement. She recently returned from studying abroad in America, her attire is fashionable, her behavior extravagant, and those she associates with are all gentry and celebrities. Because of this, her reputation has risen and she has become a socialite. When General Li was in power, the current Yarn Mill King received much assistance from him. Therefore, the Yarn Mill King still feels grateful for General Li's support, and the two have a close friendship. Later, Miss Zhou grew tired of the social scene and wanted to find a place to settle down. She asked her uncle, General Li, to help her become the Yarn Mill King's English secretary. According to the real situation of the case reported yesterday, which stated that the suicide of Zhao Dexiong, the general manager of the Zhenxing Yarn Mill, was related to the socialite Miss Zhou Manli, Miss Zhou was merely Zhao Dexiong's "trophy wife." Although Zhao was bewitched by Miss Zhou's charm and skillful manners, Miss Zhou was merely feigning affection and had no love for him. However, after Zhao's son-in-law, Sun Yuzhang, joined the Zhenxing Yarn Mill as a consultant, he and Miss Zhou began an ambiguous relationship, taking advantage of their proximity. Zhao Dexiong was unaware of this. Later, Dexiong and his daughter went to Manli's residence and encountered Yuzhang, and he finally realized the secret and suddenly understood. However, the main reason for Zhao Dexiong's suicide was not just this one incident. The Zhenxing Yarn Mill was under environmental pressure and had mortgaged the factory to the Hui Deng Bank to borrow foreign capital and maintain its precarious situation. When Zhao Dexiong's last desperate gamble also failed, the bank's comprador forced him to sign a contract to transfer the factory. Dexiong suffered this major blow and went mad.</p>
<p>Observing the above situation, the changes in the battle between golden women are vividly depicted, and the oppression of national capital by international capital is also clarified. If this theme were used to create a movie script, it would be thought-provoking and serve as a wake-up call to analyze the reasons for industrial and commercial decline. The new sound film "Hero of the Times" by Yihua Film Company adopts the above theme and adds various technical advancements, undoubtedly making it a masterpiece of domestic films. The director is Mr. Ying Yunwei, and the leading actors include Hu Ping, Shang Guanwu, Wang Naidong, Ma Loufen, Ye Juanjuan, Wan Laitian, and other major stars. It will be officially released at the Jincheng Grand Theater in the coming days, and people from all walks of life are urged to pay special attention.</p>
<h3 id="e151">After Gan Weilu Restored Chinese Nationality, He Refused to Pay the Municipal Council's House Tax: Detailed Ten Reasons Based on Law and Fact, Requesting the Court to Make a Fair Judgment on Unequal Rights and Obligations <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council collects taxes from residents within the concession based on the amount of rent paid by the residents, and collects 14% of the rent monthly. For example, if the monthly rent is 100 yuan, the tax is 14 yuan, which is collected by the council in four seasons. If there are any arrears, the council will sue in the First Special District Court according to law. All residents, Chinese and foreign, are treated equally without any favoritism. Now there is a Cantonese lawyer, Gan Deyun, who was also a lawyer in Shanghai during the time of the Mixed Court. However, his name was Gan Weilu, and his nationality was English. He had the obligation to pay taxes to the Municipal Council. However, Gan always attended the annual taxpayers' meeting and enjoyed the right to vote. In recent years, he has restored his Chinese nationality, and this voting right has been revoked. Therefore, he is unwilling to bear the obligation to pay taxes. From April 1 of this year to the end of the year, he owes a total of 239.40 yuan for the summer, autumn, and winter taxes, which the council has repeatedly sent people to collect from his office at 505 Henan Road, but he still refuses to pay. The council has recently sued him in the First Special Court, requesting that he be ordered to pay the full amount and bear the litigation costs. After being sued, Gan filed a statement of defense, listing ten reasons why the Municipal Council has no right to collect taxes from him, saying what others cannot say. His words are roughly as follows: (1) The plaintiff is a foreign municipal organization, and its exercise of power in Chinese territory without the approval and permission of the government of the Republic of China is illegal. (2) The plaintiff has no right to collect taxes from the defendant, nor can it sue the defendant. (3) The plaintiff cannot clearly state the origin of its power to collect taxes from Chinese people. (4) The right to vote and the knowledge of the collection and payment of taxes are universally recognized by taxpayers. (5) The reason why the defendant does not pay house tax is that he cannot obtain the right to vote at the annual taxpayers' meeting, while Westerners who pay the same amount of tax can attend and vote. (6) The defendant is unwilling to pay the tax because of the plaintiff's discriminatory attitude, which is too unfair. (7) According to which law does the Municipal Council only allow Westerners to vote and exclude Chinese people from enjoying the same rights? (8) The former Qing government did not grant the Shanghai Public Concession the right to collect taxes from Chinese people. (9) 14% of the house tax is too high, illegal, and has not been agreed to by the defendant. (10) If the defendant can obtain the right to vote, he is also willing to pay fair and reasonable taxes. At the end of the statement, it is stated that the total number of Chinese taxpayers in the Public Concession reaches 75% of the total population, but they have no right to elect members at the annual meeting. The tax principles of all civilized countries in the world universally recognize that the right to representation is the counterpart of the obligation to pay taxes. Therefore, before Chinese people can enjoy the same rights as Westerners, they cannot recognize the payment of this tax, and request the court to make a fair judgment, dismiss the plaintiff's lawsuit, and order the plaintiff to bear the litigation costs. Lawsuits filed by the Municipal Council to recover house taxes are common, but Gan's defense is unprecedented and novel. The case was heard by Judge Xu Fuji of the First Special Court the day before yesterday. Both the plaintiff and the defendant were represented by lawyers. The plaintiff's lawyer stated the amount of tax owed by the defendant and presented the tax bill. The defendant's lawyer, Ge Zhaoji, then presented each of the above ten reasons one by one. The court then ordered both parties to withdraw and await the verdict. On the same day, Judge Xu summoned several others who were accused of owing house taxes, including the Paochouchang Tianfaxiang Fur Shop, etc. However, the purpose of these few companies in not paying house tax was not to demand the right to vote like Gan, but to litigate with conditions.</p>

<p>The Jinglong Chemical Industry Factory, recently invented a kind of Jinglong vacuum natural fire extinguishing bomb by Wu Xiangyuan, the factory director. At about 4:00 PM yesterday, a wooden house was built on the open space of the Aodian Cinema on North Sichuan Road. The house and its surroundings were burned with flammable materials. When the fire was extremely fierce, the fire extinguishing bomb was thrown into the wooden house, and the fire was extinguished immediately. The factory invited representatives from various groups and manufacturers to watch the demonstration. Several hundred people witnessed the results and praised it. According to Wu Xiangyuan, the factory director, this fire extinguishing bomb is made of a liquid substance mixed with several kinds of secret chemical drugs, and is placed in a glass bomb using a vacuum method, so there is no danger of air leakage and the drug solution is effective forever. If this bomb is thrown into the midst of a raging fire and broken, its drug solution will turn into two kinds of non-flammable gases, absorbing a large amount of oxygen, and can immediately and universally extinguish the fierce fire.</p>

<h3 id="e173">A Visit to the Kaicheng Sulfuric Acid Plant <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Huating</p>
<p>From here, one can understand the importance of sulfuric acid in industry.</p>
<p>(1) The Relationship Between Sulfuric Acid and Industry</p>
<p>Sulfuric acid is a chemical with a wide range of uses in industry. Therefore, sulfuric acid can be called the foundation of all industries. If one wants to know whether a country's industry is developed, one can tell by the amount of sulfuric acid it needs each year. In the past, our country did not pay much attention to chemistry, and the self-manufacture of sulfuric acid was even more impossible. In recent years, however, the people of our country have gradually realized the importance of sulfuric acid in industry and military affairs, and have devoted themselves to research and careful imitation. However, it is still only in the armories of various places that small-scale sulfuric acid plants are attached to manufacture sulfuric acid for their own military applications. For other industries, due to the lack of large-scale sulfuric acid plants in the country producing large quantities of sulfuric acid, they still have to purchase foreign goods. According to a survey in the 21st year [of the Republic], the quantity of foreign sulfuric acid imported into various ports in the country is as follows: Kowloon 18,361 dan, Shanghai 12,203 dan, Tianjin 7,161 dan, Jiaozhou 7,109 dan, Dalian 2,345 dan, other ports 2,345 dan. Moreover, the market price of foreign sulfuric acid is not fixed, and is entirely controlled by foreigners. Taking Shanghai as an example, the highest price has reached more than 17 taels per case. Various acid-using factories often suffer from the heavy cost of raw materials, so that their products cannot compete with foreign goods. Therefore, in the past three to five years, the people of our country have become more aware that if the basic raw materials are controlled by others, it will be difficult for domestic industry to develop. Therefore, sulfuric acid plants have been established in various parts of the country in order to achieve the goal of self-manufacture and self-sufficiency. As of now, there are eight sulfuric acid plants established in the country (completely capitalized by Chinese). Although they cannot compete with the countries of the East and West, they have made much more progress than before.</p>
<p>(2) The Grand Scale of the Kaicheng Acid Plant</p>
<p>The colleagues of Kaicheng Sulfuric Acid Company also realized that sulfuric acid is of great importance to military affairs, and that there are no large-scale sulfuric acid plants in the country, so the sulfuric acid used by various industries has to be imported from abroad, and the outflow of cash every year is alarming. In order to develop domestic industry and to recover overflowing rights, they raised a huge sum of 872,000 yuan and organized and established Kaicheng Sulfuric Acid Company in September of the 20th year of the Republic [1931], and began preparing to build a factory. In January of the 21st year [1932], construction began on the bank of the Huangpu River on Yinhang Military Road. Unexpectedly, not long after the start of construction, the January 28th Incident broke out, and construction had to be suspended for five months. It was not until the end of June of the same year that construction could continue. At the end of January of the following year, the factory was completed. The factory authorities specifically set the start of manufacturing on January 28th, which is full of the meaning of self-alertness and not forgetting. The foundation of the factory covers an area of ​​more than 46.5 mu. The entire factory has a total of 30 ore burning furnaces (only 18 are currently open). It is large in scale and fully equipped, and is the largest sulfuric acid plant in the country. When the factory was founded, it first manufactured sulfuric acid, and then gradually expanded to manufacture inorganic and organic acids such as nitric acid, salt, and acetic acid. After several years of hard work, the entire sulfuric acid plant was completed. The iron factory produces three types of products: 66-degree concentrated acid, 58-degree tower acid, and 48-degree bao acid. Since its release, it has been tested by various factories in the country and is considered satisfactory. At the same time, foreign goods can no longer control the market. The market price, which used to be 17 taels per case, has now fallen to less than 10 taels. Looking at this, we are not worried about the influx of foreign goods, but only hope that domestic products can be developed. However, the main raw material for making acid is iron sulfide ore. Although there are several places in the country that produce it, the results of the trial use are not satisfactory. Therefore, the iron sulfide ore currently used by the factory, except for a part from Shuikoushan, Hunan, is purchased from Spain. The market price of Spanish ore is 32 yuan per ton, and the market price of Shuikoushan ore is 28 yuan per ton. The factory's lead chamber produces about 16 tons per day, using about 7 tons of ore per day, and an average of about 13 tons of lead per month. Nitric acid was originally made from Chilean nitrate, but from next month, it will be replaced by nitric acid from the local Tianli Light Gas Factory. The sales market covers the whole country, and the business is quite extensive.</p>
<p>(3) The Manufacturing Method and Uses of Sulfuric Acid</p>
<p>A. Manufacturing Method of Sulfuric Acid. There are two methods for manufacturing sulfuric acid: (1) Lead Chamber Process, (Chamber Process) (2) Contact Process, (Contael Process). Because the domestic market needs more dilute sulfuric acid (i.e. light sulfuric acid), the factory uses the lead chamber method. The manufacturing process is briefly described as follows: First, iron sulfide ore is manually hammered into small pieces of about one inch, and then placed in an ore burning furnace for burning. The ignition of the ore burning furnace only requires the use of coking coal once at the beginning of construction to heat the ore burning furnace. After that, the heat generated by the chemical reaction when the ore is burned is enough to maintain the heat of the ore burning furnace, and no more coal is needed. Put the ore into the heated furnace, and because it contains a lot of sulfur, it will burn and combine with the gas in the air to become sulfur dioxide gas, which is the first step of the project. This hot gas and air are introduced into the niter furnace through the flue, and the sulfuric acid and niter in the pot in the furnace are distilled to generate nitric acid gas, which is the second step of the project. The mixed gas of the seven descriptions still contains dust, so it must be passed into a dust removal chamber to remove it, which is the third step of the project. After the dust is removed by the dust removal chamber, it is introduced into the first Gay-Lussac tower through the flue. At the same time, a fine mist of nitric dilute acid is sprayed down from the top of the tower to convert a part of the sulfur dioxide and nitric acid into sulfuric acid and nitrous acid gas, which is the fourth step of the project. The sulfuric acid converted in the tower is discharged from the acid discharge pipe at the bottom of the tower, which is called tower acid. Its specific gravity is about 58 degrees on the Baume scale. This tower acid is the 58-degree dilute sulfuric acid sold by the company on the market. The sulfur dioxide and nitrous acid gas that have not been converted into sulfuric acid in the tower are successively introduced into the first, second, and third lead chambers, and fine mist of clean water is sprayed down from the top of each chamber to convert them all into dilute sulfuric acid, which is the fifth step of the project. The dilute sulfuric acid generated in the lead chamber is called chamber acid. Its specific gravity: the acid in the first lead chamber is about 52 degrees on the Baume scale, the acid in the second lead chamber is about 49 degrees, and the acid in the third lead chamber is mixed and mixed. The remaining gas passing through the lead chamber is then sequentially passed into the second and third lead towers through the ventilation pipe, and a fine mist of dilute sulfuric acid is sprayed down from the top of the tower to absorb the nitrous acid in the remaining gas. The resulting nitric dilute sulfuric acid is placed in an acid storage tank from the acid discharge pipe at the bottom of the tower, and is pumped back to the top of the first lead tower by acid-resistant Fengpu, and sprayed into the first lead tower, so that the nitrous acid gas it absorbs can then enter the lead chamber from the lead tower. If the exchange function of the three lead towers is like this, the nitrous acid gas can always circulate in the three lead chambers, and only a small part of the loss is supplemented by the nitric acid gas generated by the niter furnace. That is, the sulfuric acid sold by the company on the market includes three types: 48-degree dilute sulfuric acid, 58-degree dilute sulfuric acid, and 66-degree concentrated sulfuric acid. The so-called concentrated sulfuric acid is made by heating the chamber acid or tower acid to make it concentrated. It is no different from dilute sulfuric acid, but the amount of water it contains is different.</p>
<p>B. Uses of Sulfuric Acid. Since sulfuric acid is divided into dilute and concentrated types, its uses are also different. The uses of sulfuric acid are very wide, and almost all kinds of industries need sulfuric acid. The main uses are described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Uses of Dilute Sulfuric Acid. The largest use of dilute sulfuric acid is to manufacture superphosphate of lime and ammonium sulfate and other artificial fertilizers, accounting for almost eight-tenths of all uses. In addition, the main uses are to manufacture mirabilite (i.e., Glauber's salt), soda ash, caustic soda, sodium sulfide, bleaching powder, phosphorus, iodine, and bromine, and other chemical industrial raw materials and medicines, sulfurous acid, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, hydrofluoric acid, boric acid, carbonic acid, chromic acid, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, and acetic acid, and other inorganic and organic acids, potassium, barium, calcium, magnesium, lead, iron, zinc, copper, and mercury, and other raw materials for sulfate, and also in the refining of copper, lead, nickel, platinum, and silver, and other metal materials, the production of batteries, the refining of mineral oil, sugar production, and starch, the manufacture of organic pigments, the manufacture of parchment paper, the manufacture of soda water, enamel, dyeing, and gilding, and other industries, dilute acid is also the main raw material. It is also used as a precipitant, neutralizer, dispensing agent, and chemical analysis in various industries.</p>
<p>(2) Uses of Concentrated Sulfuric Acid. Although the uses of concentrated sulfuric acid are not as wide as those of dilute sulfuric acid, the quantity is also quite large, about half that of dilute sulfuric acid. The most important uses are to manufacture fatty acids, concentrated nitric acid, desulfurized acids, pigments, gunpowder, explosives, rayon, and celluloid, and other raw materials, as well as to manufacture kerosene, refined Bang La powder, and various mineral oils, refined gold and silver, separate copper and silver, and absorb moisture in the air. As for the raw materials for manufacturing sulfuric acid, there are three types: one, nitric acid; two, iron sulfide ore; and three, air.</p>
<p>In addition, the Spanish ore purchased by the factory contains about 3/1000 of arsenic. Therefore, the 48-degree dilute acid produced contains about 5/10000 of arsenous acid, which is not suitable for batteries, the manufacture of tartaric acid, citric acid, soda water, starch, and sugar, and other industries. Therefore, two sets of arsenic removal devices are specially set up to manufacture 48-degree arsenic-free dilute acid for the use of the above-mentioned factories.</p>
<p>(4) China's Acid Production and Other Countries</p>
<p>In recent years, China has established sulfuric acid plants in eight places, including Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Henan, Hanyang, Shanxi, Tianjin, and Shanghai. The largest daily output is 15 tons for Shanghai Kaicheng and Henan Shanxi, and the smallest is 5 tons per day for Tianjin Lizhong Company. The rest are around 10 tons. The total annual output is about 295,200 tons. Looking at the annual acid production of various countries in the world, Japan is 1 million tons, the United States is 4 million tons, Russia is 700,000 tons, and the United Kingdom, Germany, and France are all 1.3 million tons. According to the ratio of these quantities, it is no wonder that China's industry is so backward.</p>
<p>When the reporter visited the Kaicheng Sulfuric Acid Plant the other day, he was personally guided by Mr. Lin Dazhong and Mr. Fang Lvxhi to visit, and they explained the manufacturing method and uses of sulfuric acid in detail, for which I am very grateful. Mr. Lin graduated from the Gunpowder Department of the Faculty of Engineering of Tokyo Imperial University. After returning to China, he worked in the Hanyang Arsenal for seven years and the Shanghai Arsenal for four years. After the 21st year [of the Republic], he began to preside over the Kaicheng Sulfuric Acid Plant. Mr. Fang graduated from Fukuoka Institute of Technology in Japan and is now a technician at the factory.</p>

<p>This year's YMCA Basketball League, organized by the YMCA, is scheduled to open tonight. The participants in Group A include Jinan, You You, Pirates, Mike Lin, Qing Guang, Xie Xing, John, Tung Wah, Nan Xing, and Hujiang, a total of ten teams. Group B includes Tax College, Jewish, YMCA, Mike Lin, Yuezhong, Shaqeer, Huzhong, Moore, Guoguang, Mingqiang, and Tongwen, a total of eleven teams. The order has been arranged by the YMCA Committee and has been reported in the previous newspaper. The strength of each team is very balanced, especially the teams in Group A. Among Group B, the Tax College team, the champion of the previous season, has not been promoted to Group A this season in order to maintain its strength. Among the teams in Group A, Pirates is the champion of previous seasons and is known as one of the two strongest Western teams along with Mike Lin. Whether the Chinese teams can hold their heads high and defeat Pirates and Mike Lin this season remains to be seen in the efforts of each team. John's team is very strong this season. The generals Xu Wenkui, Zhang Shirong, Ma Fangcui, Wang Zhenlun, Zhang Yuanji, etc. are all the best of the time. If they can be lucky, it is not difficult to win the championship. The You You team is participating in the YMCA for the first time this season. Recently, they have been preparing for war and have won all battles. The veterans of the Tung Wah team, the players are all representatives of the city's National Games, such as Lu Zhongen, Jia Youliang, Chen Xianglong, and Feng Nianhua, who are superior in skill. However, they have been lacking in practice recently, which led to a defeat to John. Are these three teams the only ones who will compete with Pirates and Mike Lin among the Chinese teams this season? It has now been determined that this year's league will start at the YMCA at 7 pm tonight. There will be two Group B matches and only one Group A match between You You and Jinan. Tomorrow night, there will be two Group A matches, both of which are competitions to watch. However, the match between John and Pirates the day after tomorrow will be a tense situation. The order for tonight is as follows:</p>
<p>7:15 PM Moore vs. Mike Lin (Group B)</p>
<p>7:30 PM Mingqiang vs. John (Group B)</p>
<p>8:30 PM You You vs. Jinan (Group A)</p>

<p>The third Longhua round trip long run competition organized by the Xiguang Cross-Country Team started at 8:20 am yesterday in front of the Minli Middle School on Zhonghua Road. A total of 148 people participated. The entire course is 12 miles long, about 20,000 meters. Niu Hongquan, a new general from Chizhi University, finished the entire course with a record of 1:08:17.5, and won the championship this year. Wang Zhenglin finished second with a slight difference, with a time of 1:08:23.4. He Baoshan ranked third. Prizes were awarded on the spot after the competition, and the situation was very enthusiastic. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Departure - There were originally 215 people who signed up to participate in this year's long run race, but yesterday morning, due to the cold weather, strong winds, and slippery roads, only 148 people actually arrived. After the roll call was completed at 8:20 am, the start was made in front of Minli Middle School. With an order from the starter Shen Yuguang, 296 flying legs moved together, which was very good-looking. The referee and staff vehicles led the way, and the contestants brought their own guides to take care of them along the way by bicycle, so the process was very easy. However, due to the cold weather, the number of people who dropped out halfway was very large.</p>
<p>Situation Along the Way - In this competition, it was generally expected that Wang Zhenglin and He Baoshan had the best chance of winning the championship. After the start, when the advance reached the Xiejiao Manufacturing Bureau Road, the skinny monkey took the lead and led the crowd. He Shishan followed closely behind, unwilling to let go for two steps, while Niu Hongquan was still in the crowd at this time and did nothing. Later, when they turned into Xietu Road Luban Road, Lao Niu suddenly jumped out and ranked at the forefront. Wang Zhenglin ranked second, and He Baoshan retreated to third, while Li Duan and Zhang Liang gradually fell behind, far apart. After passing the Jingbei Command Headquarters of Nanyang Middle School at Rihui Bridge and arriving at the bottom of Longhua Pagoda, the battle line remained unchanged. When they turned back to Xiaoximen Daxing Street, Wang Zhenglin and He Baoshan drove side by side, and the difference from Niu Hongquan was only one shoulder. The competition was extremely fierce at this time, but at the finish line, Lao Niu took the lead and won the championship. The skinny monkey relied on his final sprint to surpass He Baoshan by one shoulder and ranked second. He Shishan retreated to third. Li Duan, Han Youhai, etc. finished the entire course, a total of 40 people.</p>
<p>Full Ranking (1) Niu Hongquan, (2) Wang Zhenglin, (3) He Baoshan, (4) Li Duan, (5) Li Hui, (6) Zhang Liang, (7) Wang Rulin, (8) Zhou Ruquan, (9) Ma Riji, (10) Qian Zenglong, (11) Zheng Renan, (12) Xu Peigong, (13) Yang Linfa, (14) Xu Zhouzhang, (15) Meng Yiliang (16) Yu Wenjie, (17) Ni Shiyao, (18) Yang Weixin, (19) Chen Zhiming, (20) Lin Xingshui, (21) Qu Zonghua, (22) Lu Ya, (23) Song Bin, (24) Xu Longgen, (25) Mao Qingqiu, (26) Yuan Jinlong, (27) Hu Zhongfang, (28) Qu Guijin, (29) Jin Zhaosheng, (30) Li Qingji,</p>

<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st) Zhou Fo Hai, Cai Yuanpei, and others previously submitted a proposal to the Fifth Plenary Session for determining the guiding principles for improving education at all levels in the future. After deliberation, it was decided to hand it over to the Political Council for handling. The four principles of the proposal are as follows: (1) Primary education should realistically raise funds to promote universal compulsory education; (2) Secondary education should seek to expand the quantity of vocational and normal education, and ordinary middle schools should pay attention to improving quality; (3) Higher education should strive to improve quality and raise standards; (4) All levels of schools should pay attention to character training and physical training to correct past weaknesses.</p>

<p>A reporter visited Mr. Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, yesterday to inquire about the recent state of education in the city. According to his reply, the education cause in this city is making daily progress. Since the implementation of literacy education, compulsory education has also been promoted successively. However, due to the city's tight finances, education funding is extremely difficult. The Municipal Finance Bureau owes the Education Bureau approximately 50,000 yuan in various expenses. The Education Bureau has advanced over 100,000 yuan in various items for necessary temporary expenses. Therefore, regarding school funding, the August expenses for schools in the first district of the city have not yet been fully paid, and, in addition to borrowing a portion of the September expenses for schools in rural areas, a huge amount of school funding is owed. Both the Education Bureau and the schools feel extremely difficult. When I returned to Shanghai this time, I repeatedly consulted with Mayor Wu and Secretary-General Yu, who promised to find a way for the Finance Bureau to issue the payment notices for the September expenses first and instructed the Municipal Treasury to expedite the payments, in order to first pay off the outstanding amounts for August and September to the schools. Because I had to go to Beijing, I instructed the head of the relevant section to continue to liaise for the allocation of funds before I left. At a time when the city's finances are strained, this bureau is doing its best to find solutions, but it hopes that all agencies and schools can also share the difficulties and overcome the challenges together. It is also learned that Director Pan took a train to Beijing last night to attend the First Plenary Session of the Central Committee.</p>

<p>Zhejiang Province's education funds for this year (Year 24) have been determined to total 2,460,844 yuan. The distribution of education funds for various categories is as follows: (1) Education administration expenses: 134,892 yuan, accounting for 5.48%; (2) Higher education: 231,516 yuan, accounting for 9.41%; (3) Secondary education: 826,118 yuan, accounting for 33.57%; (4) Normal education: 376,757 yuan, accounting for 15.31%; (5) Vocational education: 33,686 yuan, accounting for 13.28%; (6) Primary education: 231,308 yuan, accounting for 9.40%; (7) Social education: 308,891 yuan, accounting for 12.55%; (8) Other: 24,500 yuan, accounting for 1.00%. The total amount above is 2,460,844 yuan. (Explanation) (1) The above figures are detailed breakdowns according to the categories of education. For example, for middle schools that also run middle school, normal, and vocational courses, the amount of funding is estimated separately according to the number of classes and allocated to each category. Therefore, the percentages are more reliable. (2) In addition to the amount listed in the Year 24 Education and Culture Expenditure Budget Book, an additional 80,000 yuan was raised for the joint vocational education fund. Therefore, the total amount is also increased by 80,000 yuan.</p>

<p>I've been putting them in all the time, but it just won't fill up. I'm really tired, said Rob, stopping to rest his short legs, and beginning to think berry-picking was not as pleasant as he had imagined; for the sun was high, and still had some power to burn, and Nan was jumping about like a grasshopper, tipping the berries out of his pail as fast as he put them in; for she knew by experience that said pail was given to sudden fits of turning over.</p>
<p>“The berries were lots thicker on the other side of the wall last time we came,—and ever so much bigger; and there's a cave over there, where the boys made a fire once. Let's go over, and fill our pails real quick, and then hide in the cave, and let them come and find us,” proposed Nan, who was quite ready for a new adventure.</p>
<p>Rob agreed, and away they went, scrambled over the wall, and ran down the sloping field on the other side, till they were deep among the rocks and bushes. Here the berries were so thick that the pails were soon full; and there the ground was shady and cool, and a little spring trickled from its mossy cover to give the thirsty children a sweet draught.</p>
<p>Nan felt that getting over the wall was quite an achievement, and could not resist saying, “Now let's go and rest in the cave, and eat our luncheon.”</p>
<p>“Do you know the way?” asked Rob.</p>
<p>“Of course I do; I came once, and I never forget. Didn't I go and fetch my trunk myself?”</p>

<h3 id="e199">A Study on Implementing Equal Sales of Rice <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Li Yinbei</p>
<p>I. An Investigation of Grain Trade in the Interior</p>
<p>"Cheap grain harms farmers, expensive grain harms the people." This ancient saying remains a clear instruction today. Currently, grain prices sometimes surge and sometimes plummet, creating a very serious social problem. Although the fluctuations in grain prices are closely related to the issues of imported rice, natural disasters, and political problems in recent years, the failure to adjust the surplus and deficit of grain in various parts of the interior is also an important factor. For example, in the past few years, wheat was used as fuel in some areas, while in other rural areas, people were reduced to cannibalism due to famine. In fact, the overall food problem in China has never been addressed with adjustment methods. For example, if a certain place has always had insufficient grain, what is the amount of the shortage, and how should adjustment be initiated? If a certain place has a surplus of grain, what is the amount of the surplus, and what methods should be used to transport the grain to areas in need? Is the total grain production in the country sufficient to balance the consumption of the entire population? If the national grain production is insufficient for the consumption of the entire population, what methods should be used to adjust the shortage? Conversely, if there is a surplus of grain production, how can outlets be found for the grain, ensuring that cheap grain does not harm farmers when there is a surplus and that expensive grain does not harm the people when there is a shortage? However, to achieve this goal, it is impossible without implementing (equal sales) of grain throughout China. To implement equal sales of grain, it is necessary to start with the issue of grain surplus and deficit in the interior. To understand the surplus and deficit of grain in the interior, it is essential to begin with investigations. Only after investigation can the degree of grain surplus and deficit in the interior be expressed numerically. The Rural Reconstruction Commission, based on this objective, specifically entrusted the Shanghai Social and Economic Research Institute to conduct grain investigations in Shanghai, Nanjing, Jiangxi, Wuhu, Wuxi, and other places. However, in terms of methodology, it is always assumed that conditions are the same everywhere without having investigated in the interior. Furthermore, the degree of similarity is based on the methods used in the Shanghai investigation. In reality, this is incorrect. Methods applicable to area A are not necessarily applicable to area B; methods applicable to one time are not necessarily applicable to another. The food organization in Shanghai is different from that in Wuxi, and Nanjing cannot be considered the same either. Thus, those who hold great hope and personally enter the interior to investigate the grain surplus and deficit will be disappointed and give up because they did not pay attention to the time and space aspects of the methodology. This methodological issue restricts the entire grain investigation work. Therefore, we will describe what we have seen and understood below.</p>
<p>II. Methods of Collecting Data</p>
<p>We rely on the cooperation of transportation agencies as the most important source for investigating grain surplus and deficit. In summary, the following places are where data on grain surplus and deficit problems arise:</p>
<p>(1) Customs reports</p>
<p>(2) Railway freight records</p>
<p>(3) Highway freight records</p>
<p>(4) Account books of transfer businesses in various places</p>
<p>(5) Inland waterway shipping business account books</p>
<p>(6) Freight vouchers of boat transport businesses in various counties</p>
<p>Among the materials from the above six aspects, only customs reports and railway transportation records are currently available. Highway freight business is also not very important. As for the transportation materials of transfer businesses, inland waterway shipping businesses, and boat transport businesses in various counties, they have not been collected at all. In Shanghai, the investigation of grain trade mostly focuses on customs reports and railway freight records, multiplied by the total population of Shanghai to estimate the grain surplus and deficit. However, this investigation method is only applicable to Shanghai, a national grain distribution center, and is not suitable for the interior. The only method for investigating grain in the interior is to start with the grain trade situation and population survey in various places. Regarding the population issue, the household registration system in the interior can be used, and liaison can be made with administrative authorities. Even if the obtained materials are not entirely accurate and detailed, there should not be major discrepancies. The difficulty lies in how to start the investigation of grain trade in the interior.</p>
<p>We believe that the most important issue in the grain surplus and deficit in the interior is, of course, how much grain is imported into a certain place each year. The main sources of this data are the grain merchants and other institutions engaged in grain trade in the area. The concrete representation of the annual grain trade of these grain merchants and grain trading institutions is the account book. And the most important one is, of course, the "source of goods" account. Because the grain imported into the interior is traditionally divided into "local goods" and "foreign goods." "Local goods" reflect the surplus and deficit of local grain production; "foreign goods" reflect the surplus and deficit of grain transportation and sales in a certain place. All quantities of these two types of grain imported into a place are recorded in the source of goods account. And according to the study of material sources in statistics: the "source of goods" account can be listed as one of the "primary materials," whose accuracy is more reliable than any other data.</p>
<p>However, grain merchants often have a mysterious and elusive attitude. They are usually unwilling to easily show these types of account books. Firstly, due to business reasons, it is indeed necessary to strictly maintain confidentiality. Secondly, the issue of political taxes has undermined the trust of grain merchants, and there is also a considerable component of keeping account books secret. For example, the Social and Economic Research Institute encountered the unresolved issue of collecting wheat business tax during its investigation of grain in Wuxi. In this atmosphere of extreme suspicion, it became very difficult for investigators to collect estimates of the total annual grain imports, to the point where "knocking on the door ten times, nine times it remains unopened." It is simply a dream to collect the account books of grain merchants. I am afraid this lesson is deeply imprinted in the minds of the investigators. Although the investigation is an investigation and has nothing to do with the business tax issue, we know the psychology of the grain merchants; due to the lessons of past tax payments, they inevitably have some "bow and snake shadow" fears. The helplessness of grain merchants is an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>As for remedial measures, it is not to say that there are absolutely none; however, before the government's credibility can be established among the people, we believe that investigators must help themselves. The following four suggestions are the spiritual tools that investigators should have.</p>
<p>(A) Investigators must clarify the purpose of the investigation. Before starting the investigation, clarifying the purpose of the investigation is a necessary preliminary step. Often, many investigators neglect this initial step that should be clarified; even if they do clarify, it is vague and unclear. As a result, when grain merchants encounter investigators, they cannot understand their purpose and cannot dispel their suspicions. The cunning ones are perfunctory, while the resistant ones refuse to open their doors. In the end, they piece together unreliable materials from various sources to fulfill their responsibilities. Therefore, we cannot ignore the issue of clarifying the purpose. For example, if we are investigators directly under the administrative authority, we should explain the purpose of this investigation; if there are benefits for grain merchants, we must make grain merchants believe that these benefits are possible and not deceptive. If grain merchants have grievances to express, they should be sincerely accepted; it is best to trace the source of the grievances and find ways to alleviate them to comfort them.</p>
<p>(B) Focus on political power and use public opinion as a means of entry. Past investigators have overlooked this avenue of investigation. Observe a group of investigators going to a place; they either use an official letter to ask the local administrative authority for assistance, or they first submit a request to the competent authority of the administrative authority in a certain place, requesting them to issue an instruction to the administrative authority in a certain place to help. These methods all use administrative power as the main force, which is no longer suitable in modern society. Moreover, administrative power may not be applicable to our economic investigation work; perhaps a general report can be done, but obtaining precise and reliable statistics is probably something that administrative agencies cannot do. We believe that the best way is to start by contacting the public opinion agencies in the interior and ask them to be our investigation tools. Let us reason: public opinion is a loudspeaker that speaks for the people every day and talks closely with the people every day; compared to the function of an official letter or an instruction, it is much healthier in spirit. As long as public opinion agrees to help, any problem can be easily solved.</p>
<p>(C) Investigators must be socially educational and not politically bureaucratic. When investigators from any agency investigate this kind of economic grain issue, they should always take a social perspective and use educational means as a prerequisite. Because the nature of our investigation is to focus on research for consultation, not management or execution, based on the distinction in nature, we should only use means of food education and absolutely not contain any bureaucratic elements. Even in terms of the effectiveness of the investigation, the former is superior.</p>
<p>(D) Investigation questions should focus on outlines and abandon details. To be honest, most of the people who can preside over investigation work have undergone scientific thought training. Every question can be arranged into a web of questions in a deductive manner. Applying this web of questions to an equal level, it is not difficult to obtain satisfactory answers. However, the representatives of grain merchants in the interior are old-fashioned merchants, not new intellectuals. There are certainly some who have received scientific thought training, but on the whole, old-fashioned merchants are the majority. Therefore, if the investigation questions of the grain investigators are too complicated, they not only cannot answer them, but also find them annoying. Based on this test, when investigators discuss issues with representatives of grain merchants, they should focus on the main points of the concrete outline; it is best not to talk about unimportant issues.</p>
<p>The above four methods must be modified in application according to the social conditions of the interior. If you can follow these principles, you will surely succeed. In short, we all know that everyone has a responsibility and a vested interest in the total bankruptcy of the national rural areas; the purpose of investigating grain surplus and deficit is to revive the rural areas to prosper the cities. The reason why grain merchants in the interior are unwilling to report the trade situation truthfully to us is not that they do not support the joint revival of the rural areas; it is because they are afraid that after revealing everything, it will be detrimental to themselves. Among them, the most suspicious maze is the tax issue. At this point, investigators can only take a position of non-deception before political credibility is obtained with the trust of the people; they should focus on the above four principles to train themselves. We hope that our investigators will henceforth abide by this as a motto for investigation work.</p>
<p>III. The Importance of Average Rice Sales</p>
<p>Rice is a necessary consumer product for the livelihood of our people. In recent years, due to the intermingling of natural disasters and man-made calamities, the area suitable for rice cultivation has been shrinking daily. According to the estimate of the Statistics Bureau of the National Government's Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, the annual rice production in our country is 61,113,780,000 catties, which is only enough for 191,600,000 people to eat (see the Social and Economic Monthly Report, Volume 2, Issue 3, page 48). If this figure is reliable, then there are more than 200 million people whose food is not available. Needless to say, this is not really unavailable, but the rice obtained is not produced by China's own farmland. As for how profound this rice panic is, it can be glimpsed from the historical imported rice figures.</p>
<p>If we want to think about the rice problem, then we can only get rid of this restriction through the means of (1) expanding the area of arable land, (2) improving agricultural technology, and (3) implementing average sales. But on the first point; Mr. [blank] of [blank] in the United States estimates that China has little hope in this short period of time. The reason is that only 29% of China's total land is arable farmland; the remaining 70% of the land is either dry due to climate and lack of rain, or mountainous and barren; and many good fertile lands are often occupied by the tombs of feudal society, making good land unusable. From this inference, expanding the area of land can certainly increase rice production; but it may not be realized in the short term. On the second point, it is indeed an economical way to increase rice production, but because it is not the subject discussed in this article, it is the third point listed for the implementation of average [blank]. Before discussing this issue, we should first understand what average sales are. Simply put: average sales includes two meanings; one is that consumers implement "equal distribution," and the other is that producers implement "joint sales." In short, if this kind of average rice sales can really be implemented, at the very least, it can eliminate the concept of "self-interest and wealth" in trading behavior. Now we list a few of the average sales systems that have taken preliminary shape in our country for review.</p>
<p>(1) Sales cooperatives: Sales cooperatives are the cornerstone of "joint sales" under the average sales system; accounting for a section of the entire average sales business. Its business is to entrust the cooperative to sell the rice produced by the farmers. Although the purpose of the sales cooperative is to sell directly to consumers without going through the hands of rice middlemen; the potential power in the urban areas of the commercial society is heavily guarded; it is really "difficult to clap with one hand" to penetrate the city with the organization of a sales cooperative.</p>
<p>(2) Agricultural warehouses: Although warehouses are not executive agencies for implementing average sales; they are an important organization to assist average sales. In terms of rice consumers, it can help consumers "distribute evenly"; in terms of rice producers, it can help producers "sell jointly." However, the current warehouses are not directly operated by rice consumers or rice producers; most of the warehouses are either storage for rice or accounting rooms for banks.</p>
<p>(3) Rice sales control: Rice sales control is the policy of average rice sales. In other words, it is a kind of controlled economy; originally, the controlled economy is the latest economic policy, and many countries have adopted it. The purpose of rice sales control: the first step is to manage rice middlemen to order rice from abroad, so that the price of rice in the country will not be harmed by excessive imports of foreign rice. The second step is to count the domestic rice consumption and production, and use political power to adjust it; and according to the agricultural season, stipulate the price of rice; so that middlemen who operate rice business must not arbitrarily manipulate the market. The third step is to build extremely large warehouses in the important rice distribution centers in the country to store the surplus rice in the area; to regulate the food supply in areas lacking rice. If this method can be effectively implemented, the purpose of average rice sales may be achieved. However, this kind of sales control has not yet been realized in our country; last year, the eight-province grain marketing bureau that the central government wanted to organize but failed was a kind of average rice sales control method.</p>
<p>IV. Conclusion</p>
<p>In conclusion: the meaning of average rice sales is nothing more than the concrete manifestation of making the production economy and the consumer economy work together effectively. In the three methods described above: we find that there are four conditions for average sales:</p>
<p>The first is the storage conditions of rice; checking the rice itself is originally a troublesome thing to manage; after the implementation of average rice sales, the separate storage of farmers will be changed to centralized storage. The storage equipment of centralized storage and separate storage is very different. In terms of storage problems, ventilation equipment, moisture-proof equipment, insect-proof equipment, and rat-proof equipment all require attention; otherwise, a slight negligence will harm the entire sales system, which is no small matter! The second is the conditions for rice processing and preparation: all milling must be given considerable attention. The third is the rice marketing conditions; the fourth is the rice financial conditions.</p>
<p>Under the organization of sales cooperatives, due to the poverty of the cooperatives, the storage and processing of rice are always perfunctory. The marketing conditions also cannot be achieved in every detail; and even the financial conditions are difficult to truly achieve the principles of agricultural finance. Secondly, under the organization of the warehouse system, although it can barely be done in storage and processing; it is still far from the perfect warehouse principles. According to the records of the Rural Reconstruction Committee, among the warehouses established in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, only the Dongting warehouse in Wuxi, Jiangsu, meets the warehouse principles; most of the remaining warehouses are rented houses, ancestral halls, and temples in order to save expenses at the time of opening. As for this kind of leased building, it has already been in disrepair for many years; the safety of rice is mostly dangerous! As for the marketing conditions, although they have not been achieved: but in fact, they have no way to achieve it. Even in terms of financial conditions: there is not a single warehouse that does not take the attitude of "storage is mortgage"; therefore, storage and mortgage are not separated, where can rice talk about average sales? What is the rice sales control; because we have not seen the grain marketing bureau open for business; so it is impossible to predict it here.</p>
<p>Finally, we believe that this kind of unsystematic average sales; the method is wrong. If this continues, not only will it not reach the purpose of average sales; but it will also disrupt the order of the food organization. The future remedy is only to cooperate from both the "official" and the "people" aspects. On the government side, the Rice Average Sales Committee or the National Grain Marketing Bureau must be established immediately to control the import of foreign rice, count the rice surplus and deficit in each province, manage the national agricultural warehouses, and register the mills, rice mills, privately operated rice mills, and other processing matters related to rice; all matters related to winemaking and sugar making must also be included in the restrictions. On the people's side; they must earnestly inherit the government's control policy of average sales, organize sales cooperatives and consumer cooperatives, cooperate from top to bottom, so that the purpose of average sales can truly be achieved.</p>
<h3 id="e200">A Discussion on Promoting Rural Side Occupations <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Jun</p>
<p>In recent years, rural side occupations have been widely valued by the general public, and efforts have been made to promote them. However, promoting rural side occupations seems very simple on the surface, but it is not simple in reality.</p>
<p>The prerequisite for promoting side occupations is to recognize the basic principles, and then talk about the methods and steps of promotion. Now, please explain in detail.</p>
<p>A. Basic Principles for Promoting Side Occupations</p>
<p>(1) Adapting to the environment: The standard for promoting side occupations should be determined according to the environment and products of each place. For example, in places where mats are produced, the mat-making industry should be promoted; in places where mulberry is produced, attention should be paid to silkworm breeding, silk weaving, and silk floss making. The age and physical strength can also affect the type of side occupations promoted.</p>
<p>(2) Not hindering the main occupation: The promotion of side occupations should be based on the principle of not hindering the main occupation.</p>
<p>(3) Reducing costs and making the business easy: Low costs make it possible for farmers to afford them, and it is easier to sell. The business is easy, does not require many tools, and does not occupy much area, so that men, women, and young girls in rural areas can work anytime and anywhere. If the business occupies a large area or requires a lot of funds, it may be difficult to promote it widely.</p>
<p>(4) Utilizing raw materials: Maximize the use of the original raw materials in various places, preferably the by-products of the main occupation. For example, in areas where wheat is produced, promote the production of [blank] whips; in this way, the raw materials can be widespread, and there is no need to spend more costs, then the side occupations will naturally move towards development. Otherwise, even if there is a good plan, but the local area lacks raw materials and purchases from other places, the cost will be large, the profit will be small, and the promotion of side occupations will be difficult. It is also a pity to discard the local raw materials!</p>
<p>(5) Finding ways to expand sales channels: Sometimes, even if there are excellent products, but because there are few consumers, or they have not been promoted to distant places, it is difficult to sell, which affects the business's lack of progress. Therefore, after having a large number of products, in addition to supplying local consumption, they should be sold to the outside world; when the products sell well and have a commercial position, then that side occupation will naturally develop.</p>
<p>(6) Excellent products: To have excellent products, first select good raw materials, return to the original manufacturing, and improve manufacturing methods. For example, in the cotton areas of Tongchonghai and Qiru counties in Jiangsu, weaving cloth has always been a side occupation, and a lot of coarse cloth is produced; but now, because the market and consumers have different needs, coarse cloth is blocked. When we promote side occupations here, we should make them change to using fine yarn to weave cloth that sells well in the market, in order to sell well.</p>
<p>(7) Improving transportation and sales: Most of the products of farmers' side occupations are still controlled by merchants, and they cannot be sold at a good price, which greatly affects the business. It is best to organize transportation and sales cooperatives, where producers sell directly without going through middlemen. At the same time, improve the methods of loading, transportation, and storage, so that they can be transported to distant places without loss, especially for fruits and eggs.</p>
<p>B. Procedures for Implementing Promotion</p>
<p>The procedure for promoting side occupations should first be investigated, and the results of the investigation should be used to divide the areas of side occupations; and also emphasize the situation of various side occupations in the market as a reference for promoting the business. Secondly, organize the original side occupations, because the original business has a long history, and rural residents have some experience and training in skills and situations. We only need to organize or improve them, and they will naturally develop; after having a foundation in this aspect, we will then select one or two of the most suitable side occupations to promote. That being said, if the original side occupations are really not enough to maintain, we do not have to introduce new businesses unchanged to replace the original side occupations. In short: we must pay attention to reality, and we must not ignore reality.</p>
<p>The above is only a rough outline. The detailed methods vary according to the business - such as side occupations in the industrial sector, which are a method of promotion; and side occupations in the agricultural sector, which are another method of promotion - and vary from place to place. It is up to those who are responsible for promoting rural side occupations to determine them in a timely and event-based manner. This article will not repeat them!</p>

<p>Yesterday was another Sunday. As usual, there's little to report on banking operations, but in the money market, the call loan rate returned from 15% to 13%, indicating a rather loose and sluggish situation. Call loan transactions saw over 2.8 million yuan in early morning transfers, over 300,000 yuan in new transactions, and no trading in the afternoon session. The clearing house only saw over 400,000 yuan in transactions, resulting in an unusually quiet market atmosphere. Money shops settled over 5.1 million yuan in public foreign exchange contracts, and remittances from various routes totaled over 400,000 yuan. Collateral loan transactions saw only tens of thousands of yuan transacted by money shops, mostly involving goods. Bank settlements were suspended due to the Sunday holiday, so there is no news. In the subsidiary currency market, Jiangnan and Guangdong coins have seen no open market fluctuations since the unification of the currency system. However, no private transactions were reported yesterday either. Only 45,000 jiao were transacted. Copper coin transactions totaled 29,400 strings, equivalent to 9,800 yuan in foreign currency.</p>

<p>Last Week's Bond Market: Bulls' Position Unstable, Approximately 13.3 Million Yuan Traded in Four Days</p>
<p>Last week, from November 25th to 30th, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange experienced a lively period before and after the settlement of November futures and the commencement of January futures trading, unseen since the January 28th Incident. Excluding Wednesday and Thursday, which were closed for settlement, there were only four trading days. Daily trading volume remained at 30-40 million yuan. Bullish firms actively advanced, initially with ample reason and opportunity due to loose credit conditions after the currency reform. However, the total value of bonds is extremely large, with a significant amount scattered among the public. These bonds were sold at high prices to purchase foreign currency, creating an undeniable opportunity for this. Furthermore, the North China Incident occurred when bullish firms had satisfied their buying appetite, and its potential for expansion has emerged. One side employed various methods to salvage the situation, while the other realized the situation was unfavorable and gradually considered selling. Currently, with the bulls gradually weakening and spot goods being sold off by the general financial community and gold shops taking the lead, bullish firms are in a dilemma. If the environment does not improve and bullish firms lack the strength for a third round of purchases, there will likely be major turmoil. Last week, Monday was the last day for November futures. Ren Rugeng's rebellion in Hebei led to the first sell-off of the 78 issue, resulting in a bull squeeze after consecutive days of short squeezing. Market prices rose slightly to over two yuan. On Tuesday, trading was limited to December futures. Issues 43, 54, and 78 continued to buy, sparing no effort to raise prices, returning to over one yuan. Wednesday and Thursday were closed for settlement of November futures. On Friday, January futures trading began. The Japanese army occupied Fengtai, causing an initial rally, but a subsequent large outflow of spot goods caused a decline. Although efforts were made to support the market, the market had weakened. On Saturday, the situation in North China worsened, with bullish firms fleeing the market, morale collapsing, and the future looking difficult to manage. Under these circumstances, prices fell another three to four yuan, making it difficult to add long positions. As a result, market prices for the week fell slightly, ranging from around two yuan and three or four jiao. Total trading volume reached 13.292 million yuan. The following table compares the resulting price increases and decreases (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>Overseas Cotton Markets Fall Across the Board, US Cotton May See Acreage Reduction Next Year</p>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton opened lower due to poor Liverpool and Egyptian market reports. Longs liquidated and foreign firms sold off, causing prices to fall by 3 to 5 points per pound across various months. Local firms continued to buy on the price decline. Reports from Washington indicate a possible reduction in acreage next year. New trading was limited, and spot demand was relatively stagnant, but prices for high-grade cotton remained firm. The market closed stable, with spot prices down 5 points per pound. Futures traders sold off, and a few European exporters sold. The market was weak, with Ping Shi Er down 0.25 to 1.25 rupees, Aomula down 1.5 to 1.75 rupees, and Bai Luoxi down 1.25 rupees. The original telegrams are on the left (telegram dated 30th):</p>

<h3 id="e210">Advice to Coughing Patients <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Shen Zhaoquan</p>
<p>Coughing is an opposing movement of the airways. It often begins with a deep breath, followed by an opposing movement of the airways. A sudden, forceful expulsion of phlegm occurs, opening the closed glottis. The sound produced at this time is called a cough. Healthy individuals generally cough due to inhaling strong air, catching a cold, or irritation of the trachea and throat by smoke and dust. However, irritation of the ear canal or root of the tongue can also trigger a cough. Coughs are often caused by asthma, bronchitis, laryngitis, tuberculosis, emphysema, whooping cough, pharyngitis, airway ulcers, and small tumors in the larynx, as well as various other respiratory diseases. When a person coughs, the systemic venous circulation is disrupted, causing the veins in the forehead and neck to swell, with distinct blue veins becoming visible. The face may turn pale and red. This phenomenon is readily observable. Furthermore, increased pressure in the lungs can lead to emphysema.</p>
<p>Common coughs invariably involve the expectoration of phlegm. Coughs without phlegm are called dry coughs, which can be caused by irritation of the ear canal, laryngitis, bronchitis, or whooping cough. Healthy individuals only cough when smoke, dust, or other irritants enter the airways. Those with respiratory illnesses may cough immediately after inhaling cold air or air containing dust. However, there are exceptions. If the patient is unconscious, the throat or bronchi are already paralyzed, or the respiratory muscles are weakened due to chronic bronchitis (such as in children with underdeveloped muscles or individuals with weakened respiratory muscles due to fever), coughing may be difficult even when there is a cause for it.</p>
<p>Phlegm can have several characteristics, but generally consists of mucus, pus, and epithelial cells. Sometimes it contains blood cells, strong fibers, or tuberculosis bacteria, which are only present in certain diseases.</p>
<p>Even minor coughs should be treated immediately. Ignoring them can easily lead to serious conditions such as pneumonia and tuberculosis. As the saying goes, "A cold that doesn't heal turns into consumption." Therefore, prompt treatment is essential.</p>
<p>Anyone who has had a cough due to a cold for more than three weeks should suspect tuberculosis and seek medical attention early. Do not let it go untreated.</p>
<p>The treatment for coughing depends on the cause but generally aims to resolve phlegm and suppress the cough. Commonly used medications include Tr. Ipeacacuanha, Tr. Senega, Ammonia Chlorate, Tolu Balsam, and Codeine. Therefore, cough drops and cough syrups sold on the market are generally made from these ingredients. They have limited effectiveness and can easily harm the appetite, making them unsuitable for long-term use.</p>
<p>Recently, I have been using "Fei Huo" (Lung Reviver), Phith Weal, to treat coughs, asthma, and shortness of breath with rapid and effective results. It is superior to all other cough medications. The medicine is sweet and palatable, making it easy for women and children to take. Long-term use does not harm the appetite. This medication can effectively relieve coughing from old age, phlegm, tuberculosis, colds, and other coughs on the same day and cure them within days. Furthermore, taking "Fei Huo" helps improve health and prevent tuberculosis. It is especially recommended for those with weak constitutions, weak lungs, and excessive phlegm.</p>
<h3 id="e211">The Foundation of Tuberculosis Recovery <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Jiang Guanqun</p>
<p>The quality of nutrition is closely related to the progression of tuberculosis in patients. Poor nutrition leads to weakness, weight loss, and accelerated disease progression. Conversely, good nutrition leads to weight gain and gradual improvement in the disease. The patient's weight and body build are often used to determine the stage of tuberculosis. Therefore, good nutrition and weight gain are the foundation of tuberculosis recovery.</p>
<p>To achieve good nutrition, it is important to eat nutritious and easily digestible foods, such as animal products like meat, fish, milk, and eggs, as well as plant products like rice, wheat, beans, and vegetables. It is important not to favor one type over the other and to consume both animal and plant-based foods. It is also important to eat a variety of foods instead of relying on a single item. The body requires various nutrients (i.e., protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins, etc.) in proper proportions for nourishment. No single food contains all of these nutrients. Therefore, eating only one type of food every day can lead to an excess or deficiency of certain nutrients, making it difficult to achieve a balanced diet. Furthermore, even the best foods can become unappealing if eaten every day for a long time, leading to a loss of appetite. Therefore, tuberculosis patients should eat a variety of foods.</p>
<p>A healthy digestive system is the foundation of tuberculosis treatment. To achieve good nutrition, the digestive system must be healthy. A healthy digestive system directly affects appetite. Food should be chewed thoroughly to allow saliva to mix with it before swallowing. If food is swallowed too quickly without proper chewing, digestion will be incomplete, and the amount of nutrients absorbed by the body will be reduced, diminishing its nutritional value. This can lead to fatigue in the digestive system, causing indigestion and malnutrition. The key to curing tuberculosis lies in strengthening the body to overcome the tuberculosis bacteria. However, the absorption ability of tuberculosis patients is often weak, leading to poor nutrition. Therefore, consuming large amounts of food may not be digestible or absorbable, and may even worsen gastrointestinal problems.</p>
<p>Of the nutrients required by the human body, protein is the most important, followed by carbohydrates and fats. Other inorganic salts and vitamins are needed in much smaller amounts. With the exception of protein, the other nutrients can be sufficiently absorbed from ordinary foods. However, protein requires the most effort and complex digestion to obtain. Therefore, it is difficult for tuberculosis patients, who have weak digestive systems, to obtain sufficient protein from their daily diet.</p>
<p>Therefore, tuberculosis patients must seek protein supplements in addition to ordinary foods. However, many of the tonics sold on the market often contain only small amounts of phosphorus, arsenic, iron, calcium, iodine, etc., and offer little actual benefit, sometimes even harming the digestive system and hindering recovery. Tuberculosis patients should be very careful when purchasing tonics.</p>
<p>"Kang's Life Element" (Conbour's Sanvita-Cell) is made from animal protein that has been completely digested artificially using enzymes. It contains various essential amino acids. It can be absorbed directly by the body without digestion, nourishing the body, producing blood, and building muscle. It also encourages cells to promote metabolism and rejuvenate the whole body, increasing the secretion of digestive juices to aid digestion. It also plays a key role in disease resistance, brain development, physical activity, and reproductive organ function. The toxins produced by tuberculosis cause severe protein breakdown in the body, making it appropriate to take this product to supplement protein deficiency. Furthermore, this product enhances nutrition in tuberculosis patients, naturally increasing their healing power and resistance. Therefore, it is an important medicine for treating tuberculosis. Taking this medicine can achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>In my years of treating tuberculosis, I have consistently prescribed "Kang's Life Element" (Conbour's San-Vita-Cell) and "Fei Huo" (Phith Weal) for patients to take internally, along with instructions to rest, seek fresh air and sunlight, and pay close attention to their diet and living conditions. The reports I have received from patients have been overwhelmingly positive. From this, we can conclude that "Kang's Life Element" (Conbour's San-Vita-Cell) can be used to improve the nutritional status and enhance the natural healing abilities of tuberculosis patients, making it an essential medicine for treating the disease.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Lecture on Neurasthenia <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>The Destroyer of Family Happiness: Dysfunction of the Reproductive Organs</p>
<p>— (Physician Shen Xiangbo)</p>
<p>Causes and Treatment of Impotence</p>
<p>Impotence, commonly known as kidney deficiency, is a very broad symptom. It essentially involves the complete loss of the ability to perform sexual intercourse, resulting in infertility. It deprives couples of the joys of intimacy, leading to discord and increased distress. Therefore, impotence can be said to be a destroyer of family happiness.</p>
<p>There are many causes of impotence, broadly classified into three categories: diseases and abnormalities of the reproductive organs, lack of excitability in the erection center, and psychological disorders related to reflexes. These are described below:</p>
<p>(1) Impotence caused by diseases and abnormalities of the reproductive organs: This category includes dozens of symptoms. The most severe is organic impotence, caused by deformities, phimosis, defects, or underdevelopment of the reproductive organs, or by abnormalities near the penis. However, even in these cases, depending on the severity of the symptoms, reproductive function may not be completely lost.</p>
<p>(2) Impotence caused by lack of excitability in the erection center: This is caused by damage to the erection nerves, often accompanied by decreased or complete loss of libido. This is due to chronic gonorrhea and syphilis, tuberculosis, kidney disease, myelitis, obesity, and other diseases affecting the prostate or urethral glands. Sexual excitement is completely obstructed, resulting in impotence due to the loss of stimulation to the libido center. Intoxication from alcohol, tobacco, opium, morphine, arsenic, etc., can also be a cause. In particular, excessive masturbation and sexual intercourse can lead to loss of excitability in the erection and ejaculation centers, a condition known as masturbatory impotence.</p>
<p>(3) Impotence caused by psychological disorders related to reflexes: This is caused by strong mental emotions such as fright, worry, shame, anger, and terror. Some pure young men fear contracting syphilis and are plagued by obsessive thoughts, leading to impotence. Furthermore, inventors who are engrossed in scientific pursuits may concentrate their minds on a particular area, resulting in impotence. The causes of impotence are indeed varied and numerous.</p>
<p>Treatment for impotence: Because impotence is not an independent disease but rather caused by various factors, the underlying cause must be treated first. Generally speaking, impotence is often reversible. Based on my clinical experience, the most effective medication for treating impotence is the endocrine preparation "Huan Er Tong" (Well Tonic). Simply follow the directions for use (two tablets three times a day before meals), and it is almost certain to be effective. However, strict adherence to health rules is also necessary during the treatment period. Avoid excessive consumption of stimulating foods and drinks (such as tobacco, alcohol, coffee, spicy peppers, onions, garlic, etc.). Favor nutritious foods such as milk, eggs, meat broth, chicken broth, and fish. If impotence is caused by physical weakness or anemia, "Huan Er Tong" (Well Tonic) should be combined with a blood-tonifying agent. "Kang's Life Element" (Conbour's San-Vita-Cell) is the best blood-tonifying medicine. Other important measures include avoiding physical and mental overexertion and engaging in appropriate exercise. Cold water baths or cold water rubs are also helpful methods for assisting in the treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e213">A Casual Discussion on Lung Disease <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Shen Zhaoquan</p>
<p>1.  No Medicine Exists Today to Directly Kill Tuberculosis Bacteria</p>
<p>Today, the lung remedies sold on the market are numerous and too many to list. Those advertised with exaggerated claims of efficacy in newspapers and magazines all prove to be illusions upon clinical experimentation, ultimately revealing their complete ineffectiveness. However, many lung disease sufferers are misled by these claims, delaying proper treatment and leading themselves to a hopeless situation.</p>
<p>The cause of pulmonary tuberculosis is the tubercle bacillus, a fact widely known by those with some scientific knowledge. This bacterium is extremely resistant, and no medicine can easily eradicate it. Despite rapid advancements in modern medicine, an effective drug that can directly kill the tubercle bacillus has yet to be discovered. Our principle in treating tuberculosis is to enhance the body’s resistance, indirectly leading to recovery, rather than directly killing the bacteria.</p>
<p>Although many agents can directly kill tubercle bacilli in laboratory test tubes, they all possess intense toxicity. If used in the human body, they would cause immense harm before eradicating the bacteria. Moreover, medications, whether taken orally or injected, must circulate through blood vessels throughout the body to reach the lesions to be effective. However, tuberculosis lesions are located in a corner of the lung tissue where no blood vessels exist. Therefore, even if a safe bactericidal drug existed, its effectiveness could not be manifested. In other words, the site of bacterial proliferation is unreachable by drugs. Thus, the unreliability of such drugs acting on tubercle bacilli within the body can be understood.</p>
<p>2.  Using Endocrine Preparations as Adjunctive Therapy Can Shorten the Recovery Process</p>
<p>Patients with pulmonary tuberculosis often suffer from neurasthenia and metabolic disorders, which greatly weaken their resistance and hinder recovery. From my clinical experience, in addition to general fundamental therapies for treating lung disease, I also use the endocrine preparation "Wille Tonic" for patients to take orally. (This product is made from the essence extracted from the youth glands of animals.) After taking it for ten or more days, patients feel mentally refreshed, their appetite improves, the vitality of their body's cells is restored, the dwindling life functions are recovered, and the phenomenon of premature aging is stopped. As a result, natural resistance increases, leading to improved disease conditions and a shortened recovery process. Furthermore, lung disease patients often experience nocturnal emissions, making "Wille Tonic" even more appropriate.</p>
<p>3.  Calcium and Pulmonary Tuberculosis</p>
<p>Calcium, whose component is lime, functions to increase the amount of lime in the blood, depositing it in the lesions to harden them, promote scar formation, and prevent their spread. It also inhibits inflammation and has a strong clotting power, preventing hemoptysis. For this reason, despite the continuous emergence of new drugs, the application of calcium has not diminished.</p>
<p>To introduce large amounts of calcium into the patient's body, intravenous injection is necessary. Although oral administration can introduce a large amount each time, it cannot be fully absorbed and is mostly excreted, yielding little effect. Therefore, among the various calcium preparations sold on the market, injections are effective, while oral administration is ineffective. If patients purchase them for oral consumption, it is merely a waste of money.</p>
<p>Calcium injections should be given once daily, gradually increasing the dosage. Mild cases may see results after fifty to sixty injections. Severe cases may not see results without more than a hundred injections. Furthermore, the injection procedure is quite difficult and should be performed by a skilled physician.</p>
<p>(Our hospital has an economical lung treatment program, covering the cost of injections until recovery for only sixty yuan.)</p>
<p>4.  Strenuous Exercise for Lung Disease Patients is Equivalent to Suicide</p>
<p>Most lung disease patients are thin and emaciated. It is commonly said that exercise can strengthen the body and develop muscles. Therefore, patients, without considering the consequences, engage in exercise, leading to a deepening of the disease and making it incurable. It is important to realize that exercise for fitness is suitable for healthy individuals, but not for patients. Because the lungs of lung disease patients are already damaged (i.e., tuberculosis), the goal is to allow cells to surround the affected area and promote scarring for healing. Engaging in exercise accelerates blood circulation and deepens lung respiration, making the tuberculosis lesions prone to rupture and preventing scar formation. At the same time, it gives the tubercle bacilli (i.e., tuberculosis bacteria) an opportunity to spread. It is truly regrettable. Therefore, I earnestly and loudly proclaim to everyone: "Lung disease patients must rest quietly and avoid exercise at all costs. Exercise is suicide!"</p>
<p>5.  Scarring of Lung Lesions is a Sign of Tuberculosis Healing</p>
<p>The physiological and anatomical phenomenon of lung disease healing is the encapsulation of tuberculosis lesions in the lungs by the body's cells and tissues, forming scars. As a result, all symptoms subside, and health is restored. Therefore, those with strong physical fitness have sufficient resistance, enabling cells to effectively surround the affected area, forming scars and leading to recovery. Our fundamental principle in treating tuberculosis is based on this.</p>
<p>Modern scholars consider drug treatment for tuberculosis to be unreliable and have harmful and toxic effects on the body, not a safe treatment method. Therefore, based on the aforementioned principle of scarring for healing, modern scholars have pioneered a new approach: organ therapy (i.e., using preparations made from animal lungs and spleens) for tuberculosis, which has shown remarkable effectiveness.</p>
<p>The earliest inventor of this organ preparation is "Phith Weal," which is widely sold on the market. This product is the pioneer of organ therapy for tuberculosis and can be called a world-exclusive holy medicine for lung treatment.</p>
<p>The ingredients contained in "Phith Weal" are hormones harmoniously extracted and produced from the fresh lungs, spleens, livers, testicles, and other organs of mammals. In addition, it contains tonic lecithin (also known as lipids) and valuable medications for cough suppression and phlegm reduction. Patients can achieve the effects of taking more than ten types of medications simultaneously by using this one medicine ("Phith Weal").</p>
<p>After taking it, tuberculosis patients experience increased appetite, sound sleep, elimination of night sweats, increased weight, mental vitality, a rosy complexion, reduced or eliminated fever, thinned sputum, reduced or completely stopped coughing.</p>
<p>Scientifically speaking, after ingestion, the active ingredients of these organ preparations are absorbed into the blood from the stomach, circulate throughout the body, and have a direct effect on the lungs. They stimulate the weakened tissues in the lesions, maintaining the harmony of their functions, promoting tissue regeneration, and filling in their defects (repairing cavities). At the same time, they build a solid connective tissue wall around the lesions, hardening them, forming scars, and completely encapsulating the evil tubercle bacilli, cutting off their food supply, and causing them to die. This agent also promotes blood coagulation, significantly preventing hemoptysis. This has been proven by physicians in various countries.</p>
<p>Recently, I used "Phith Weal" to treat one hundred lung disease patients, and the recovery rate was over 85%, setting a new record for modern tuberculosis treatment. It is truly the most reliable and effective tuberculosis treatment agent. Even stage III lung disease patients often achieve unexpected results with this agent, and many have recovered.</p>

<p>Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, the leader of the Fascist Party, once told his party members: "In life, one must be courageous and forge ahead. One cannot be overly cautious and hesitant in everything. As a leader, I must lead by example and live amidst danger, without evading it." He also said, "If I retreat, kill me. If I advance, follow me. If I die, avenge me." From these words, one can understand his character.</p>
<p>Mussolini has an unwavering ambition and a spirit of self-improvement. He despises those who live in a drunken stupor, wasting money and time. While serving as the government's prime minister and the party's leader, he could have lived a life of ease and arrogance. However, he maintained a very strict private life. Apart from obligatory dinners, he never set foot in theaters or aristocratic cafes. Therefore, he moved the entire ancient Roman nation and inspired the people of Italy, leading to today's vibrant and energetic Italy.</p>
<h3 id="e215">The Eccentric Old Man <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Kuangsong</p>
<p>According to my friend Mr. Chen, his great-uncle had some interesting habits. After hearing about them, I felt they met the criteria of an eccentric and I'm writing them down as follows:</p>
<p>The old man lived to be seventy-nine years old, which is not a short lifespan. According to him, he was able to live long because he never washed his body. One bath, and all the original qi is lost. External colds take the opportunity to invade, easily causing illness. When people have a balanced qi, it naturally circulates. After bathing, the body is tired and exhausted, and the internal organs become deficient. It is not a way to maintain good health. Therefore, besides the three "exercises" that Chinese people must do, he never immersed his body in water. When people argued with him, he would stroke his beard and say with smug satisfaction, using himself as an example: "Look at me, you little kids, learn from me!"</p>
<p>Once the Mid-Autumn Festival passed, he would put on a blue cotton robe and wear it until the summer solstice of the following year, when he would switch to a summer linen gown that he had worn for decades, as if his year only had winter and summer.</p>
<p>Old people have weakening heart blood and do not like to sleep at night. At the same time, they easily get hungry during the long nights. So, he put peanut candies next to his pillow, and rats made a comfortable nest in his bed. But he didn’t care at all. Having nothing to do at night, he would take out the silver dollars he had saved throughout his life from the cellar and count them one by one, almost every night. Later, someone replaced his silver dollars with fakes, but he did not know at all.</p>
<p>Three days before his death, he bought all kinds of fireworks and set them off continuously at the door for three days and nights. When he died, people said he had ascended to heaven.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Supplement to the Jade Mountain Cottage <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Yunqiu</p>
<p>My previous research on the Jade Mountain Cottage was not comprehensive, so I am supplementing it.</p>
<p>During the late Yuan Dynasty, Gu Aying lived amidst the turmoil of war but excelled in garden and pavilion construction. Day and night, he hosted high-ranking and talented individuals, setting up wine and composing poetry, enjoying endless celebrations, almost forgetting that it was a time of great unrest. Famous scholars of the time, such as Yang Lianfu, Ni Yunlin, and Ke Jiusi, and dozens of others joined his society. (Dong Chao's Dong Gao Miscellaneous Records)</p>
<p>The Jade Mountain Gathering took place in February of the Zhi Zheng Wuzi year. Zhongying was not yet forty years old, and at that time, the world had been peaceful for a long time. The cottage was famous in Suzhou. Scholars from all over the country who passed through Suzhou would inquire about the cottage, and Zhongying generously used his wealth to gather guests, enjoying the company of famous figures and poets, indulging in literary and wine gatherings almost every day. The elegance and literary talent of these gatherings truly illuminated the ages. However, in November of that year, Fang Guozhen's troops rose up in Taizhou. From then on, Liu Futong, Xu Shouhui, Chen Youliang, and Zhang Shicheng, among others, waged war, causing chaos. By the Bing Shen year, when Shicheng entered Wu, the cottage was almost destroyed by the army, and people fled in disarray, with no more joy as before. (Xingmei Poetry Talk)</p>
<p>There were twenty-four pavilions and halls in Zhongying's Jade Mountain Cottage. The plaques and scrolls were inscribed by famous officials, senior scholars, and elegant individuals, who expressed their admiration for Zhongying through their poems and calligraphy. Zhongying cherished them more than antiques. In the Guisi year, the thirteenth year of the Zhi Zheng era, Zhang Shicheng raised troops in Taizhou, disrupting the three Wus. In the Bing Shen year, troops entered the cottage in the first month, and the paintings and calligraphy were all taken away. In the second month, Zhang Shicheng's troops entered Pingjiang. In the fourth month, hundreds of soldiers suddenly arrived with weapons, urgently seeking Zhongying. At that time, Zhongying was still seeking refuge on a boat, thus escaping. When he returned to the cottage, all the scrolls had been taken. One day, Commander Feng Bingzhong visited and told Shenying: "Your family's poetry scrolls were taken away by the soldiers. I knew that you valued them, so I retrieved them all for you and will return them tomorrow." In a few days, he brought back more than seventy scrolls stored in boxes to the cottage. When inspecting the scrolls from the pavilions and halls, only the scrolls from the Willow Pond, Crimson Snow, and Green Waves were missing. Zhongying, along with Yuan Ziying and Ma Mengzhao, searched for them separately. Zhongying also recorded the dates of gaining and losing them.

<p>Because she was too fat, people called her "Simmons."</p>
<p>"Simmons" is the specific name for a type of Western-style bed: this thing is soft and comfortable, and if it is under someone's body, how can it not be intoxicating?</p>
<p>For this reason, all of us male colleagues secretly dedicated this elegant name to our fat and fleshy girl.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our Miss Simmons lacks common sense: she does not understand the meaning of "Simmons": when we discovered this weakness; we male colleagues became even wilder and more absurd; before, we said it behind her back, but now it is different, to her face:</p>
<p>"Miss Simmons!"</p>
<p>"What are you saying?" she asked:</p>
<p>"Um—this is a respectful address for pretty ladies!"</p>
<p>She smiled knowingly—she fell for our trick!</p>
<p>From then on: the fun began: everyone called her "Simmons" in a serious and seemingly intimate tone!</p>
<p>Until now, Miss Simmons is still in the dark about our deception.</p>

<p>Chapter Twenty-One: Tenderly, a Charming Maiden Passes the Court, Admiring the Moon’s Beauty; Ardently, a Son-in-Law Is Taught, Listening to the Roar of the Lion from the Next Room</p>
<p>Zhiqian said softly to Hokkaido: Look, we don't need to do much; this madam will find a way. Haven't you heard that she asks the old man for money, opening her mouth for three thousand at a time? With such a large income, spending a little money to help the poor is nothing to her. Hokkaido stopped talking and looked out the window. Before long, he saw the tea boy leading Hu's wife into the courtyard, heading towards the next room. First, he heard Hu's wife narrating for a while, then he heard the bureau chief's wife say: You people are so ignorant. A person in the banking world can just grab money from a box. How could you sell such a beautiful girl for only one hundred and fifty yuan? Then there was the sound of Hu's wife's cackling laugh. Clearly, she couldn't answer that question. The woman said: You people are really honest. The girl has been sold, but she still lives in the hotel. Seeing each other doesn't mean she'll lose a piece of flesh. Then he heard Hu's wife chime in: That's right! If it weren't for that Mrs. Zhou, she wouldn't be supporting us and seeing the girl, either? And we've seen each other and talked. I'm just afraid that the old man will get angry and make things difficult for the girl. The woman said: Humph! You inland people haven't seen any big shots. Like us in Nanjing and Shanghai, we can meet them anywhere. They're just businessmen. What power do they have to oppress people? That Mrs. Zhou is my comrade. If that Mr. Jia bullies the Zhu girl, just report it to me, and I can lend a hand. Following this, there was a long sigh, it was the bureau chief taking over. He said: Aren't you meddling too much? It's someone else's married couple. (369)</p>

<h3 id="e220">Anecdotes about Sun Chuanfang <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Aimei</p>
<p>Ten years ago, he was known as the "United Commander of Five Provinces," awe-inspiring for a time. After his defeat, he devoted himself to Buddhism, repenting for his killings. Recently, Sun Chuanfang was assassinated in Tianjin's Buddhist Layman's Forest by Shi Jianqiao, a woman claiming to be avenging her father. This reminds me of some old stories about him that I can share with readers.</p>
<p>In the early summer of 1926, I had a brief encounter with Sun. At that time, I was only thirteen years old, studying at Bao Ying Si Bu Elementary School, when he retreated to northern Jiangsu. A few days earlier, a battalion of defeated soldiers retreated, barging into our school and disrupting the classrooms. Teachers retreated, and students scattered in chaos. As a result, the school suspended classes and became a camp for soldiers. A few days later, the United Commander's imperial entourage (?) arrived. I remember that the county magistrate, named Xie Ying, style name Shitong, busily led all civil and military officials to hold a welcome meeting, specifically calling for teachers and students from various schools to participate. Therefore, I also got to see his honorable face, truly a great honor. The United Commander kindly gave us some encouraging instructions and even rewarded us with some money, which was very warm and touching. Unfortunately, we couldn't continue our studies at the time, which was also thanks to the United Commander!</p>
<p>In the evening, after returning home from the meeting, we couldn't help but chat about the day's events. This sparked my father's conversation, and he told a widely known story of injustice, that is, a past event of Sun: "During the Qi-Lu War, Sun began to prosper. He started to worry about his high position and wanted to eliminate dissidents. He sent countless plainclothes detectives, densely distributed in various ports, to detect and arrest the so-called rebels. At that time, there was a small business owner surnamed Chen in Zhenjiang. Because there was discord between his wife and mother-in-law, he couldn't stand the pressure from both sides, so he left home and ran away to Shanghai, planning to make a living on his own. However, after staying for half a month, he still couldn't find a job, and the money he had brought was running out. He was always stuck in the hotel, inevitably sighing. Coincidentally, a detective lived in the room next door. Because he couldn't catch any reactionaries, he was also frowning. He had heard the sighing from the neighboring room for three days in a row and suddenly had an idea. He went over to get to know the man surnamed Chen, and they hit it off, becoming friends. The man surnamed Chen was inexperienced and had no social knowledge. He couldn't help but reveal his background and intentions. The detective was even more delighted and used sweet words, claiming to be Sun's confidant, promising to recommend him for a job, which would definitely succeed. He flattered him, luring him to Nanjing. The man surnamed Chen couldn't refuse? The next day, the detective took out a paper package and a letter, both tightly sealed, and gave them to the man surnamed Chen, saying: 'This letter is my recommendation letter. The paper package contains Sun's documents. He had asked me for it. Please take them all to him and present them to the United Commander!' He put the man surnamed Chen on the train. After the train left, he immediately sent a telegram to Sun, saying: 'A rebel, Chen, is taking the train to the province at a certain time, and will arrive at a certain time. Please send troops to the station to arrest him immediately.' When the man surnamed Chen arrived at the station, he saw a team of soldiers rushing onto the train. They asked: 'Who is Mr. Chen?' He thought they were there to welcome him, so he was overjoyed and quickly stepped forward to admit it. The soldiers immediately changed their faces, tied him up, and searched his luggage, finding the letter and the paper package. When they opened them, they were all reactionary documents, and the letter was the detective's report of his success to the United Commander. Without giving him a chance to explain, they grabbed him like a swallow and took him to Yaostreet, where he was executed by firing squad. It turned out that Sun had ordered them: 'I am busy and don't have time to interrogate. If you don't find any evidence, just detain him for now. If the evidence is solid, then execute him first, and then report to me.' When the man surnamed Chen's family received the news, although they had connections in the province, they could have rescued him, but how could they have made it in time? All they could do was go to the province and claim a wronged body. When my father told the story, he remembered the names of the deceased and his family, as well as the name of the wood shop. But now, after so long, I have forgotten them, so I can only record the events."</p>
<p>Now, Sun is dead. As for his life's rights and wrongs, merits and demerits, history will judge them. I don't need to say too much. But thinking of the "changing stars and shifting objects, ten years of vicissitudes," I can't help but feel: "Where is the hero of the world now?"</p>
<h3 id="e221">Notes on What I Saw <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— (Yangtze River)</p>
<p>Walking through the alley on Jiaozhou Road, Ri Xin Village, past the Shen Guo football field, I saw the wicked ingenuity of some wild children again.</p>
<p>Two children, eleven or twelve years old, were pulling two bamboo fence poles away, while a child of eight or nine was struggling to pull because he was too weak.</p>
<p>The gap in the fence was already quite large. Dogs could enter and exit freely. If people were willing to humble themselves, they could also go in and out freely by bending over. But in the wild children's basket, all that could be seen was a uniform collection of broken fence bamboo, which was enough to prove where the bamboo was going and where the small woodcutters' firewood came from.</p>
<p>As soon as the smallest child had pulled one stalk, he retreated into the opposite alley. Out of curiosity, I wanted to see their expressions, so I stood at the entrance of the alley without moving. Unexpectedly, the smallest child calmly said to me:</p>
<p>What? Do you want to come in? If you don't, I'm going to close the door.</p>
<p>Immediately, he closed half of the iron gate of the alley. I vaguely saw them doing the breaking work.</p>
<p>On the way, I thought that this is not only an educational problem but also a serious social problem.</p>

<p>Science is advancing, changing with each passing day. The progress of new medicine is also advancing alongside the progress of science. Before the 15th century, European medicine was mired in philosophical medicine, engaging in mutual debates and divergent factions, much like the current state of traditional medicine in our country. The 15th and 16th centuries are called the Renaissance by historians. Scholars broke through the fallacies of tedious schools of thought, corrected the mistakes of the ancients, and added religious reforms. Epidemics were prevalent. Medical scientists cultivated a spirit of faithfully observing nature. The face of medicine underwent a change. By the 17th century, natural sciences such as astronomy, physics, mathematics, chemistry, and various sophisticated machines were developing and progressing daily. Medicine, under the influence of science, also showed significant progress. Many important medical inventions began in this century. Now, the important medical discoveries since the 17th century will be described below. It is hoped that those who are mindful of the progress of new medicine will be pleased to hear it.</p>

<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(Q) What is liver fluke disease?</p>
<p>(A) Liver fluke disease (Distenriasis hepates) is caused by a type of fluke (distoma) that parasitizes the liver.</p>
<p>(Q) How does one become infected with this parasite?</p>
<p>(A) The larvae of this parasite first parasitize aquatic organisms such as snails and crucian carp; people become infected after eating these.</p>
<p>(Q) What symptoms appear when people have this parasite in their liver?</p>
<p>(A) Normally it starts in the summer and autumn. You may feel an increased appetite, a feeling of fullness in the stomach, and sometimes diarrhea. The liver becomes enlarged and then later shrinks. The liver surface is smooth but without tenderness.</p>
<p>(Q) What do patients feel as the disease progresses?</p>
<p>(A) As the disease progresses, more severe diarrhea is seen. Because the parasite's irritation causes a large amount of bile to flow into the intestines. Lower limb edema, ascites, night blindness, etc. may occur. The spleen also becomes enlarged. In addition, anemia, epistaxis, hematemesis, and hematochezia may develop. As a result, the patient's whole body weakens and leads to death. Different from cirrhosis, edema of the skin is seen at the same time as ascites.</p>
<p>(Q) Does the disease always progress continuously?</p>
<p>(A) No. It is usually mild in winter and worsens in summer and autumn.</p>
<p>(Q) What disease should it be distinguished from?</p>
<p>(A) It should be distinguished from liver fragmentation disease. Simply check the stool for the presence of parasite eggs.</p>
<p>(Q) Is this disease dangerous?</p>
<p>(A) It is less dangerous to life; however, severe diarrhea or bleeding from various parts of the body is dangerous.</p>
<p>(Q) How is liver fluke disease treated?</p>
<p>(A) If people eat vegetables contaminated with dog tapeworm (Distomiasishepatescoccus), hydatid cysts may develop in the liver, with two types: unilocular and multilocular. So, liver hydatid cysts are caused by dog tapeworms parasitizing the liver.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the symptoms of unilocular liver hydatid cysts?</p>
<p>(A) If it occurs on the liver surface, an elastic, undulating mass will appear, moving with breathing. Although there are no symptoms such as anemia or cachexia, there are often many complications such as cyst suppuration and perforation into the gastrointestinal tract.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the symptoms of multilocular liver hydatid cysts?</p>
<p>(A) Rarely seen. The liver develops into a hard, solid tumor that does not undulate but is tender. Jaundice, ascites, splenomegaly, or gastrointestinal bleeding often develop.</p>
<p>(Q) Is this disease dangerous?</p>
<p>(A) Unilocular cysts are not very dangerous; multilocular cysts are dangerous.</p>
<p>(Q) How are liver hydatid cysts treated?</p>
<p>(A) Unilocular cysts can be treated with surgery; multilocular cysts cannot.</p>

<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(71) Foreign Objects in the Ear</p>
<p>The condition of foreign objects in the ear refers to the presence of foreign objects in the external auditory canal. There are many types of foreign objects. For example, beans, beads, buttons, small shells, matchsticks, as well as mosquitoes, flies, lice, stink bugs, etc., can all enter the ear. There are two ways that foreign objects can enter: voluntary and involuntary. Children often play with beans, beads, buttons, etc., and put them into their ears themselves. Adults often have the habit of using matchsticks (as a substitute for ear picks) to scratch the external auditory canal, which often leads to breakage and entry into the ear. Both are voluntary entries. As for mosquitoes, flies, lice, stink bugs, etc., they mostly belong to involuntary entry. The symptoms caused by foreign objects entering the ear vary greatly. Some may enter the ear and have no symptoms even after several years. Others may damage the external auditory canal or eardrum, causing the patient to suddenly panic and feel frightened. Some may not have tinnitus, dizziness, hearing loss, etc. at first, but later develop these symptoms due to the entry of water. There are countless possibilities. Now, let's briefly describe the symptoms caused by each type of foreign object as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Beans—After children put beans into their ears themselves, there may be no symptoms. However, once water enters the ear (washing face or bathing), the beans will swell up upon contact with water and fill the ear, causing the child to suddenly feel tinnitus, dizziness, hearing loss, etc., attracting the parents' attention and seeking medical treatment.</p>
<p>(2) Beads, Buttons, Small Shells—These are mostly round and do not damage the external auditory canal or eardrum. They also do not swell up upon contact with water. Therefore, there are often no symptoms even after several years.</p>
<p>(3) Matchsticks—Matchsticks are mostly used to stop itching in the external auditory canal. Because people are eager to stop the itching, they will use great force. Therefore, there are two possible results. One is that the matchstick easily breaks and enters the ear, becoming a foreign object in the ear. The other is damage to the external auditory canal (most common) or even the eardrum, leading to external otitis or otitis media, causing sudden swelling, pain, pus discharge, and other suffering. This is something we have encountered many times.</p>
<p>(4) Mosquitoes, Flies, Bugs, Stink Bugs—The entry of these small creatures into the ear is entirely involuntary. Therefore, they constantly fly around and move within the ear, trying to get out. At this time, the patient feels something moving in the ear and thinks that it has already entered the brain, suddenly causing terror and panic. In fact, anatomically speaking, it is impossible for it to enter the brain.</p>
<p>Regarding the foreign objects mentioned above, do not try to remove them yourself or have them removed by barbers with no medical knowledge, as it can often backfire, pushing them further in or damaging the external auditory canal or middle ear, causing pain and danger. Therefore, it is imperative that a doctor examines the type, size, shape, and location of the foreign object in detail. Then, use ear drops, ear irrigation, or extraction methods accordingly. In some cases, surgery may even be required for the most appropriate treatment.</p>

<p>(3) Environment: Chinese people often like to live in large family groups, with dense populations and small, closely packed houses. The air is turbid and scarce. There is little outdoor exercise and no attention to hygiene. Public organizations, institutions, factories, schools, etc., lack sanitary facilities, weakening people's resistance and making them susceptible to the disease.</p>
<p>(4) Precautions: A. Spitting everywhere spreads germs. Recently, the Department of Pulmonary Tuberculosis of the First Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross Society conducted a field survey in a small vegetable market and other busy areas, collecting 100 sputum samples from the ground. 10% of the sputum contained tubercle bacilli. The actual number of TB cases is even higher than the aforementioned percentage. Chinese people often spit out sputum at will without examination, so there is a lot of tuberculosis. And B. Not washing hands before meals allows dust to transmit germs, unknowingly carrying tubercle bacilli into the mouth or respiratory tract.</p>
<p>(5) Cow's Milk: Among animals, cows are most likely to have tuberculosis. And the number of people drinking cow's milk is increasing. If cows are not examined and the milk from sick cows is given to people to drink, tuberculosis will often be transmitted to humans.</p>
<p>(6) Transmission: A. Talking to patients. B. Kissing. C. Sharing food without separate servings. D. Carelessly touching the patient's clothes, bedding, utensils, chopsticks, sputum cups, etc. For example, laborers, nurses, and doctors in hospitals are sometimes easily infected. E. According to a survey by the U.S. Public Health Service, postal workers who handle letters and stamps daily are infected by germs on the stamps. Approximately 1% of those who send 100 to 500 letters per day have tuberculosis. This is likely due to the common habit of moistening the back of stamps with saliva and sticking them on envelopes.</p>
<p>(7) Occupation: Those who work as machinists and laborers in trains, ships, and factories are constantly exposed to coal gas, making them prone to pulmonary tuberculosis. In addition, stone masons, miners, leather workers, etc., who inhale impurities are also susceptible to lung diseases. Also, those who sit still and rarely see the sun are prone to weakness and lung disease.</p>
<p>(8) Constitution: Those with a weak constitution are prone to pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>
<p>(9) Special: Those with febrile diseases and chronic diseases such as whooping cough, pleurisy, pneumonia, measles, and diabetes are susceptible to pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>
<p>(10) Local Conditions: Patients with scrofula, tuberculous lymphadenitis, etc., often develop pulmonary tuberculosis at the same time. (11) Tubercle bacillus (Bacillus tuberclb)</p>
<p>(4) Symptoms of Pulmonary Tuberculosis:</p>
<p>The symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis can be summarized as follows: 1. Night cough and expectoration. 2. Hemoptysis (coughing up blood) accounts for approximately 60% to 80% of cases. 3. Night sweats. 4. Low-grade fever. Often felt in the afternoon or evening. 5. Cheek redness. 6. Decreased appetite and weight loss. 7. Chest pain. 8. Anemia and emaciation. 9. Irritability, etc. Recently, Peterdy of the United States has classified symptoms by cause, making them clearer. Here is a special record. A classification of the ordinary symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis according to the following cause</p>
<p>The first category is due to blood toxicity and aging (1) Lack of endurance (Lock of eudulauec) (2) Fatigue and weakness. (3) Nerve instability (Nerve instability) (4) Digestive impairment. (5) Metabolic disturbances result in weight loss. (6) Pulse rate increases. (7) Night sweats. (8) Body temperature rises (9) Changes in blood.</p>
<p>The second category is caused by reflection. (1) Hoarseness. (2) Throat irritation. (3) Cough. (4) Digestive impairment. (5) Changes in blood circulation. (6) Chest and scapular pain. (7) Cheek redness. (8) Spasms of the muscles of the shoulder girdle. Spasms of the central tendon and diaphragmatic crura. (9) The movement of the affected side is reduced by traction. Local symptoms due to toxins and reflection</p>
<p>The third category is local symptoms caused by toxins and reflection. (1) Frequent colds and prolonged colds. (Tuberculous tracheobronchitis) (2) Hemoptysis. (3) Membranitis. (Tuberculosis of the pleura) (4) Cough.</p>

<p>— Li Xing</p>
<p>The first local anesthetic discovered was cocaine. Cocaine is a compound analyzed from coca leaves. The Red Indians of Chile and Bolivia in South America have chewed coca leaves since ancient times to suppress hunger or remove fatigue or stimulate nerve excitement. The precursor to the discovery of cocaine was in 1860, when Wöhler, Niemann, and Lossen simultaneously pointed out that cocaine had the effect of numbing the tongue, but unfortunately, its importance was not realized. In 1880, the British Medical Council only recognized cocaine as a stimulant that could be used as a substitute for caffeine. In the same year, Anrep meticulously studied the various medicinal properties of cocaine. In 1884, Koller, an ophthalmologist in Vienna, tried the ordinary medicinal properties of cocaine. He recognized that the effect of cocaine numbing the tongue was an anesthetic effect. Because he was paying attention to ophthalmic anesthetics, he experimented with cocaine, first dripping cocaine solution into the eyes of livestock, and then experimenting on ophthalmic patients in the hospital. He found that cocaine was a powerful anesthetic. So he reported his discovery at the Ophthalmology Association. From this time on, cocaine local anesthetic was introduced to the world and became popular globally.</p>
<p>Although cocaine was available as a local anesthetic, it was not an ideal local anesthetic because it was prone to poisoning and had limited uses. Later scholars continued to study cocaine substitutes and discovered several better local anesthetics. Today, cocaine is gradually being used less and less, and in the near future, it will probably only remain a name in medical history.</p>
<p>The action of a local anesthetic is to locally numb the sensory nerves (or pain nerves). When the local nerve is numbed, it will not transmit the sensation of pain to the pain center in the brain when it is injured, so the injured area does not feel pain. For example, before a tooth extraction, an anesthetic is injected into the root of the tooth, numbing the nerves of the tooth and the nerves of the gums. This cannot transmit the sensation of pain to the brain, so you won't feel pain when the tooth is extracted. The reason for injecting an anesthetic for pain relief during local surgery is the same. If cocaine-like anesthetics are dropped on mucous membranes, such as in the nose or eyes, they can have a numbing effect. From this, it can be seen that local anesthetics are not some kind of miraculous effect.</p>
<p>Injecting a small amount of anesthetic has little effect on the body. On the one hand, it is more economical than taking drugs, and on the other hand, it is safer than taking drugs. The most common one currently used is novocaine, which has very low toxicity and is the most important injectable anesthetic. There are also various other anesthetics that are used for dripping, rubbing, or injecting, and their effects are much the same.</p>
<p>In addition to its numbing properties, cocaine also has anesthetic properties, its effect being stimulation followed by depression. Cocaine views cocaine as a stimulant, and its nature and action are similar to morphine, so cocaine is also one of the strictly prohibited drugs. Most cocaine offenders in the United States are black people, or prostitutes, or various criminal offenders. The responsibility for their crimes is partly due to the stimulating and confusing nerve action of cocaine. Doctors use cocaine in surgical operations to benefit patients, but ignorant people abuse injections to help excite and become arrogant, driving themselves to all kinds of evil, and actually making themselves a pest to mankind, so it is reasonable for them to be subject to the extreme punishment of the state.

<p>— Lin Jianxian</p>
<p>(Question 58) Why should you pay the most attention to cavities?</p>
<p>(Answer) First, because they are most common. Second, because our teeth suffer the most damage from decay. Third, because in addition to causing local diseases, they can also cause various systemic diseases, greatly affecting health. Fourth, because this problem can be reduced if prevented early and stopped if treated promptly. So you should pay the most attention and study it more.</p>
<p>(Question 59) What has been thought to be the cause of cavities in our country?</p>
<p>(Answer) It was thought to be a visible, wriggling tooth worm in the mouth.</p>
<p>(Question 60) According to current medical discoveries, what is the cause of cavities?</p>
<p>(Answer) The most direct cause is acid in the mouth. It dissolves the collagen in the enamel and removes the lime in the teeth. Therefore, the part of the tooth that is eroded by acid will gradually soften and rot into a hole.</p>
<p>(Question 61) Where does the acid in the mouth come from?</p>
<p>(Answer) It is produced by the fermentation and acidification of food residue in the mouth, especially carbohydrates, such as starches and sugars, through the action of microorganisms.</p>
<p>(Question 62) Why is food residue in the mouth so easily fermented and acidified?</p>
<p>(Answer) All food fermentation requires suitable temperature, moisture, and enclosure, and there must be fermentation microorganisms present. (The yeast we use to make wine and vinegar is a type of fermentation bacteria. Milk will ferment and turn sour after being left for a long time, which is also the effect of fermentation bacteria.) Our mouths have a temperature, moisture, and darkness that are extremely suitable for fermentation. And there are many different types of microorganisms hidden. Therefore, food left in the mouth is extremely easily fermented and acidified. The mouth is like a manufacturing plant. In this plant, food is the raw material, microorganisms are the manufacturers, and acid is the manufactured product. If there is no raw material or no manufacturer, this harmful acid cannot be produced. Therefore, all three can be considered causes of cavities.</p>
<p>(Question 63) Is this fermentation microorganism a worm?</p>
<p>(Answer) It is not the tooth worm that we have always believed in. It is plant-based, not animal-based. And it is very small. Tens of millions of them can attach to one tooth. It is by no means visible to the naked eye. Furthermore, these microorganisms themselves do not damage the teeth. What is harmful is the lactic acid produced when they develop and reproduce.</p>
<p>(Question 64) Are there any other causes of cavities?</p>
<p>(Answer) In addition to the main cause mentioned above, there are many contributing factors that can induce cavities and help them progress. These contributing factors can be divided into systemic and local types.</p>
<p>(Question 65) How many local contributing factors are there?</p>
<p>(Answer) There are limited local contributing factors in the oral cavity: (1) Neglecting oral hygiene, being lazy about brushing teeth, and allowing food to accumulate. (2) Irregular tooth alignment, making them difficult to brush. (3) Hard tooth injuries, causing cracks (4) Eating more soft foods containing carbohydrates, such as rice, wheat, and sugar, and less coarse foods rich in fiber, such as vegetables and raw fruits. The former easily adheres to teeth, facilitating the progress of acidification, while the latter has the effect of grinding the teeth and natural cleaning.</p>

<p>(2) Lipoids: This is a method that has been popular for a long time. Even now, some people still use it. In fact, its therapeutic effect is only on the general condition of the patient, such as anemia and loss of appetite, which is not without improvement; it is also possible for the patient's weight to increase as a result. It has no direct effect on the lung disease itself. There are also quite a few preparations of this kind produced by pharmaceutical factories around the world; their contents are also different and each has its own characteristics. The ingredients include combinations of lecithin and glycerin, lipoids and "Ya Te Ling", and combinations of fatty lipids and wax. Its application is generally by injection into the human body; there are also a few made into ointments for external application.</p>
<p>(3) Drugs: This can also be called chemotherapy. We know that in the current treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis, there is absolutely no so-called specific drug that can directly kill tuberculosis bacteria without harming the human body. The clinical achievements mentioned here are undeniable; however, compared with the pharmacological basis and the truly effective drug, it is still far behind, which is beyond help. The characteristics and value of each of them are now described separately below:</p>
<p>(A) Gold Preparations: It has long been proven that gold preparations can kill tuberculosis bacteria, but direct use in treatment is not without harm to the human body; therefore, it is the expectation of every pharmaceutical expert and clinician to make gold preparations into non-toxic and effective drugs. But until now, it has not been completely successful. We must know that the current treatment principles for pulmonary tuberculosis are nothing more than two: one is to find ways to eliminate lesions and bacteria nests, and the other is to increase the patient's own vitality to resist the disease. Although gold preparations have the effect of directly killing bacteria, their purpose in clinical application is still biased towards the second method. Therefore, this type of newly produced preparation… although it has appeared, it is ultimately no more than a kind of stimulating therapy, and it is definitely not a specific drug: this should be clearly understood!</p>

<h3 id="e231">"Prohibiting Oil Transportation to Italy Almost Means War"? <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Yin</p>
<p>Reuters, Rome, November 25: "If countries prohibit the transport of coal and oil to Italy, Italy will withdraw from the League of Nations. According to well-informed Italian sources: Mussolini regards cutting off the supply of coal and oil as a hostile act. If countries implement it, Italy will reconsider its position in the League of Nations. Mussolini accepted the implementation of financial and economic sanctions by the League of Nations under protest, but did not regard it as a hostile act. Now, if essential supplies are prohibited to Italy, making Italy's war in Abyssinia more difficult, it will inevitably cause a serious situation, which seems to cause dangerous reactions in Europe."</p>
<p>This time, the League of Nations, under the support of Britain and France—especially British imperialism, implemented unprecedentedly tough sanctions against Italy's war of aggression against Abyssinia. This move seems to have some sense of justice on the surface, but in reality, everyone knows that this is a head-on collision between British and Italian imperialism. However, we cannot deny that League of Nations member states such as the Soviet Union and small and weak nations have expressed their sympathy and assistance to Abyssinia in this sanction.</p>
<p>This sanction is undoubtedly a very serious threat to Italian ideologists. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has repeatedly protested and considered withdrawing from the League of Nations, and has resorted to concentrating domestic cash, restricting the export of goods, and reducing various consumptions…etc. to show how anxious and worried he is about coping with this sanction, in order to resolve the difficulties in the war of aggression against Abyssinia and the general situation. The most uncomfortable thing for Italy in this difficulty is naturally the prohibition of coal and oil transportation to Italy by various countries.</p>
<p>In modern war countries, coal and oil occupy a very important position. Prohibiting the transport of coal and oil to Italy is tantamount to making Italy lose an important link in the war of aggression against Abyssinia, and abandoning all the previous victories of Italy. And Italy itself is not a country that produces coal and oil. Since this threat is so significant, Italy cannot but seek to resist it; therefore, it is also undoubtedly that the European situation will "cause dangerous reactions" as a result.</p>
<p>The Italian ambassador to France visited Laval on the 23rd and declared: "Prohibiting oil to Italy almost means war." Now Mussolini further "regards cutting off the supply of coal and oil as a hostile act," which shows the impact of the oil embargo on the current European situation. If this situation really changes seriously as the telegrams convey, then the words of the Italian ambassador to France are enough to make us smell the gunpowder.</p>

<p>— Simon</p>
<p>Lying in a deep slumber at night, on that street lit by dim gas lamps, with a desolate medieval feel, the huge black shadow of the chapel lay on the street. This residential area of ​​the wandering Norman ethnic group is full of the decadent sense of noble dreams and the feeling of national subjugation!</p>
<p>The dilapidated houses, chewing on the breath of moss, looking at those ragged and resentful imperial Russian remnants who have lost their bright smiles, but living here is very suitable for quietness, the hustle and bustle of the city is completely isolated, shrouded in an atmosphere of boundless loneliness. Every day, except for the chapel knocking with fragmented mirror sounds, there are few vehicles passing by, only letting the gentle sun occupy the resting place.</p>
<p>That white-haired landlord still maintains the leisurely lifestyle he used to be unwilling to give up: getting up early to urge the servants to wash the stairs and dust off the ceiling. Then he went out and bought a bunch of fresh flowers, leisurely walked back, inserted them into the vase, then dragged out a broken rattan chair with its roots torn apart, sat on the stone steps outside the door to bask in the sun, and looked down, dreaming a shattered gorgeous dream there.</p>
<p>"Hello, Good morning"</p>
<p>Every time he glanced at me coming out, he always said this in not very fluent English, looking at me faintly with dull eyes.</p>
<p>This old foreign wanderer is wearing dirty and broken clothes. Like a beggar. But this is not what makes me annoying. What I hated from the beginning was living such a vague, homeless, gray existence, stubbornly clinging to the decadent gentleman's habits of the owning class and hypocritical petit bourgeois rituals. These poor people!</p>
<p>In the big house, sounds are rarely heard, and the floor is covered with thick felt, so even the footsteps of people walking are gone. Like an empty temple without anyone living in it. The landlord doesn't work and lives off the rent. He himself uses contemplation and memories to pass the time. He hardly leaves the house for weeks, seemingly forgetting the world and being forgotten by the world at the same time.</p>
<p>However, what surprised me was that one day I walked into the landlord's bedroom, and the splendid and dazzling decorations, noble objects, and artful arrangements were simply what only a bourgeois person could have. This magnificent impression that caught my eye made me almost unable to believe my vision. I looked at the owner's old and broken clothes again, which aroused a very contradictory feeling. The exiled people of the old Russian emperor were so unwilling to take off their brilliant and glorious robes. But the brilliant and glorious robes had been snatched away by the Bolshevik warriors. What would you rely on to snatch them back?</p>
<p>The familiar white Russian wandering girl with chestnut hair and blue eyes also retained the arrogant posture of the buried king. She also used rouge to restore her aging youth. Although the cheongsam had faded, she still put on a holed jacket, walking so slowly and gracefully, humming a well-rhythmed tune while walking. Even when cooking in the kitchen, she didn't forget to sing while doing it. They seemed to have become accustomed to a wandering life, without memories, without longing for their Russian homeland, without sorrow. But who will appreciate your beauty, your smiles, your songs, and who are they leaning towards? Is it going to the jazz music nightclub, throwing yourself into the arms of foreigners, and imprinting the lipstick on your lips on the high stiff collar of a drunken sailor?</p>
<p>So tomorrow's borscht and cigarettes are exchanged for the sale of one's own body.</p>
<p>But what about tomorrow's tomorrow? What about the day after tomorrow? Exiled girls from Siberia, now it is winter. Has the grand costume for winter been made? Where is the warm homeland? Who are the listeners who pour out songs of passionate love to you?</p>

<p>— Hu Weixiong</p>
<p>The young mistress wiped away her tears, and was about to get up and go downstairs to find out what was going on, when a loud and strange noise rang out in the next room again:</p>
<p>"I said it long ago, people from small families are small-minded, and nothing pleases them! Marrying a wife should mean marrying one from a declining family. Look, they've driven your son out the door. You old hag, see what else you have to say?"</p>
<p>Although it was the old couple scolding each other, the wife deliberately raised her voice so that the young mistress could hear it, which was true. The young master had been out for two days and hadn't returned home, and the young mistress had been crying for two whole days—she no longer had any hope for her husband, but the wife's indirect scolding, beating the dog by scolding the chicken, scolded the young mistress as worse than anything. From morning to night, downstairs, in the next room, she ranted as she pleased, like singing the news; when guests came to visit, the wife found an opponent and added fuel to the fire, treating it like a myth, repeating it over and over again, one hundred and ten times. The root of everything was that people from small families were small-minded, and nothing pleased them; while the faults of her own precious son were praised in reverse: —"People say that the temper of an only son is spoiled. My A-Xiang has no temper. Not to mention his filial piety to his parents, he was obedient in every way when that thing entered the door—if he was asked to come back earlier, he would even refuse the socializing with his friends; he would bring back big bags and small bags every day to please her. In this situation, a man has to socialize outside. He just came home a little late that day, and the day hadn't even dawned, and she cried and screamed, causing unrest in the whole house! Humph! When we were daughters-in-law, we didn't dare to breathe loudly, but she even scolded everything out! Think about it, I'm so old, and I've got a daughter-in-law to teach me, shameless thing, does she need a man to sleep with her every day to feel comfortable?"</p>
<p>The wife was sometimes unable to catch her breath and rubbed her chest repeatedly, but as soon as she turned around, she called out again and again like a printing machine. The old master still spoke publicly: "What's the point of yelling and making a fuss like this! A-Xiang is not a good thing either. He's only been married for two months, and he's already hooked up with Ah-Xiang, who was brought over as a maid by his wife's family. Now he's out there messing around with flowers and grass until late at night. It's reasonable for the new mistress to persuade him. The young couple haven't broken up, but you're helping in there…"</p>
<p>This added fuel to the fire, and all the words scolding the daughter-in-law were moved to the "old hag's" body. In the end, she even said that the old man had no good intentions and was helping the daughter-in-law to teach his wife.</p>
<p>For the past two days, the mansion was like a teahouse, with people singing the news and people listening to the news, which made the servants cover their mouths and laugh. Some even told everything to the alley.</p>
<p>The young mistress hadn't left her room for two whole days, nor had she eaten. Ah-Xiang was a maid who had come over with her mother's family, and because she had been hooked up by the young master, she didn't dare to see the mistress either. An old woman, who had raised the young master, brought tea and rice to the room to persuade the young mistress. She said in a low voice:</p>
<p>"The wife just has this temper, she takes advantage of the wind. None of the people here have been able to stay long. The young master also has the wife's temper. Although I raised him, I don't hide it from you, this temper is difficult to deal with! Mistress, don't be angry, eat a little rice, it's not worth it to get angry. A beautiful new mistress like you, if you persuade him well, the young master will always change his mind."</p>
<p>The young mistress nodded, but in fact she didn't hear a word. She felt that the people in this house were as terrible as demons, and she was a prisoner under the claws of the demons. Even Ah-Xiang, who was on her side, had been hooked by them. The young mistress glanced at the furniture in the bedroom. A picture of lotus flowers growing on the same stem was reflected in the dressing mirror opposite her. She pushed the old woman out, fell on the bed and cried, but she didn't dare to cry out loud.</p>
<p>She resented her own fate, resented her family's poverty, so many people came to be matchmakers, but she married such a husband. He had abandoned her after only two months, and her mother-in-law was an unreasonable tiger. She wanted to go home immediately and cry to her mother, but how did her mother teach her when she went back home: Now you are a daughter-in-law, which is different from being a young lady at home. You must obey your in-laws in everything, and the young couple must get along well. You can't be willful! Does being a daughter-in-law mean serving her masters like a slave? The young mistress asked herself. Although a sympathetic answer was ringing in her ears, when she looked up, the room was empty and only she was alone. The mother-in-law's iron voice rang out again in the next room</p>
<p>"...Humph! Eating the Lu family's food is not easy, dying of hunger is just like dying a dog. Can't the Lu family find a thing like this? If A-Xiang doesn't come back for a day, you're not allowed to send food in, did you hear that?"</p>
<h3 id="e234">Small Notes Before the Window <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Taro</p>
<p>(1) Small First Words</p>
<p>I always lie on this only small writing desk near the window, writing, writing... When I feel tired, I drink tea and smoke to stimulate my spirit, but there is a time when tea and cigarettes lose their effectiveness, I use my two withered hands to hold my throbbing head, and look at the unknown old tree in front of the window, to temporarily relieve my depressed chest.</p>
<p>When will I be allowed to leave this window, even if it is only for a second, as long as that second is facing the selfless front.</p>
<p>(2) Broken Biscuits</p>
<p>In the left corner of the table, there is a bag of broken biscuits with only half left...</p>
<p>When I carried the broken biscuits back "home," the child jumped up with joy and called me in a very affectionate tone:</p>
<p>"Daddy! Daddy!"</p>
<p>I smiled and looked at the child, only to see her little eyes like those of a hungry cat, staring at the bag of broken biscuits. She licked her lips and asked me:</p>
<p>"Daddy! What is this?"</p>
<p>"Biscuits!"</p>
<p>Seeing the child's poor and pitiful face, I felt an unspeakable bitterness in my heart. My wife also came closer to me. I sat down on the chair, and the child quickly climbed onto my lap. I trembled, no, my heart trembled! I opened the bag of broken biscuits. The child hurriedly put her little hand into the mouth of the paper bag and grabbed a handful of biscuits. She took a look, was stunned for a moment, and a look of doubt appeared on her face. She looked at me, and then stuffed the broken biscuits into her mouth. I picked out a big piece and handed it to my wife:</p>
<p>"You taste one too!"</p>
<p>My wife silently accepted what I gave her. When I picked up a piece and put it in my mouth myself, the child suddenly asked me:</p>
<p>"Daddy! Why are these biscuits broken?"</p>
<p>I stared blankly! I almost wanted to shout at the child.</p>
<p>"You, baby! Why are you asking me this!"</p>
<p>But I didn't shout at the child after all. I only said to the child gently.</p>
<p>"You eat!"</p>
<p>(3) Fallen Leaves</p>
<p>I can't lie down and write anymore. Tea and cigarettes have lost their effect of stimulating my spirit. I held my head and looked out the window. - The leaves on that old tree fell down with a gust of wind!</p>
<p>This situation may not be felt by others, but for me, I, I can't bear to watch it to the end! I closed my eyes tightly, and infinite grief enveloped my chest. God! I, I,...</p>
<p>I wake up in the middle of the night every time. Logically speaking, my tired body should sleep well at night! But on the contrary, I woke up, and I can't fall asleep anymore! Coughing that stings the lungs is incessant all night long. Sometimes it wakes up my wife. She opened her eyes sleepily, swayed her feet, and got out of bed to pour me a glass of hot water and asked me to drink it. When she saw me drinking the boiled water, my wife covered her face and cried! Fallen leaves, why do you have to fall in front of my eyes!</p>
<p>(4) Cod Liver Oil</p>
<p>Seeing the fallen leaves, I felt even more fear that my life was heading towards the path of annihilation. I didn't want to die so young. I wanted to live, because I had unfinished responsibilities.</p>
<p>Cod liver oil, the advertisement said: "...are all effective, and especially good at treating lungs..." With the money I earned with my own blood, I bought a bottle. - But now, that bottle of cod liver oil will be drunk up in less than a week! My wife glanced at it, secretly took some things out, and when she came back, she bought a bag of rice.</p>
<p>I pretended not to see anything and just looked at the few cod liver oil in the bottle.</p>
<p>I saw the fallen leaves in front of the window again.</p>

<p>— Ji Xuan</p>
<p>So, under the names of "gambling house" and "boss," Ah Lin's heart gradually beat faster. He had set up a gambling house in the "Zhixuanju" teahouse on the street for his friends to "play" mahjong, poker, pai gow... It wasn't a day or two! Ah Lin had some "friendships" among the brothers of a group of "idlers," which everyone knew! Relying on this "gambling house," he had already made a lot of money from the nearby workers, and he had even taken a concubine. But he made friends on the "brother" level, and he had a "small axe" to "protect" his gambling house!</p>
<p>Facing this scene, he laughed loudly: "Friend, what do I owe you? Is that a 'gambling debt'? Haha, great, great, you report it to the bureau and ask people to arrest me, you go to the government to sue me, that's a 'gambling debt', isn't it?"</p>
<p>Snake-like venomous words hit Wang Da's dazed heart. Thinking of more than a year of unemployment, thinking of the many money lost (now, it has become a debt with heavy interest), thinking of tomorrow's life, he was stunned; a burst of heat rushed up from his heart, and he suddenly became clear, and suddenly grabbed Ah Lin's collar, and pulled this huge body out of the door like an ox and pounced on him.</p>
<p>"The money I lost! You liar! You...robber!"</p>
<p>The two shadows twisted together, scolding, pouncing, and beating, carrying the hatred used to deal with the flesh of life, carrying the inferior wine that had just been poured into their stomachs, and carrying the troubles of life these days, Wang Da smashed Ah Lin like crazy, and Ah Lin reached out to touch the small axe inserted in his waistband, but it was gone.</p>
<p>The noise spread, and on the dark street, three shadows ran over! They beat Wang Da, who was red-eyed, like wild beasts... He kept scolding: "You liar! You blood-sucking ghost!"... Finally, one person took an axe and slashed hard at Da's shoulder!</p>
<p>A strange cry rose in the dark night, and Wang Da's body relaxed. Three axes fell like two points and one line. Finally, blood flowed out like water, and the person was soaked in it.</p>
<p>Quietly, the three "brothers" slipped away from the darkness again. Ah Lin said to them with injuries, "Also let people know our interests... If you have any ideas, we'll talk about it tomorrow. If there's anything wrong? I'll protect the gambling house, I will!"</p>
<p>Everything returned to silence. The street lights shone on a pile of flesh and blood lying on the asphalt road. Now, he no longer had to worry about tomorrow's life...because he no longer had a tomorrow's life.</p>

<p>Opening: "Three Smiles Encounter Beauty"</p>
<p>Wu Hui's talent, Tang Jieyuan, does not seek to be an official. His superb painting skills are unmatched. His reputation is famous in all directions. His family has eight beauties like flowers. The orchard has two hundred broad peach trees. Remember, under the osmanthus flowers, he drinks merrily. He makes a bet with his wife and jokes happily. Today, he intends to visit beauties and leave the gate. He disguises himself as a merchant to deceive her. He goes along Shantang all the way. He carefully observes the warbling flowers of the seven miles. He goes to the side of Huqiu Mountain and sees a big official boat moored on the river. It turns out to be the Dragon Pavilion Prime Minister's wife. There are four maids holding incense candles. Looking closely at her elegant demeanor, the youngest maid is the most charming. Hearing her name, he knows she is named Qiuxiang. Her beauty is truly a feast for the eyes. Since he has come to Lingshan, he must pay homage to the Buddha. He accidentally loses Meng Jia's hat. He wins a smile from the beauty. The intentional guest sees the unintentional smile. A strand of affection is secretly conveyed. He closely follows her to the foot of the mountain. He sees a crowd of people boarding the boat. How can he beg the heavens to grant him convenience? Blow the sails and turn the boat around. Blow the beauty into my garden.</p>

<p>The inaugural issue of "Zhou Bo" was published yesterday (i.e., in front of the Shanghai Commercial News Tofu Shop). The content is quite exciting. Chen Yaoting respectfully dedicates a poem to Bao Xuexue, "Mutual Understanding." Although the author states that there is no need to overthink and suspect, it is expected that there will be many people who will put their minds to it. Special introduction (Editor)</p>
<p>Miss Zhang Suzhen, director of the Ming Mei Troupe, went to Ningbo on the 22nd to perform. It is said that the price of her selling her thighs every day is five silver dollars.</p>
<p>Miss Chun Mei's mouth is indeed larger than that of ordinary people.</p>
<p>Miss Tao Tao has recently changed her name to Li Ling.</p>
<p>Mr. Ma Xingtao, the violinist of the Rose Troupe, plays the piano differently from others, actually using his right hand for harmony. It is truly rare.</p>
<p>Miss Lingling is currently studying at He'an Primary School on Xinzha Road. When playing, she often blurts out the phrase "Tell the teacher."</p>
<p>Miss Li Ya has recently been suffering from eye disease and has not yet recovered.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Mingyi, the former president of Baijia Society, said that Yao Ping is the best pianist in the entire Shanghai broadcasting industry.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Qi, the former president of Qiyin Society, has recently been diligently exploring Miss Liying's past history. It is said that he will write a biography of Miss Liying in tens of thousands of words. (Above by Mengying)</p>
<p>The second issue of "Feng Ming Ji," published by Feng Ming Advertising Agency, is about to be published. The content is richer and more exciting than the first issue. All kinds of noble recreational works are classified and categorized, making it a grand spectacle. It is also said that during the pre-order period, each copy is half-price, actually collecting three cents. Those from all walks of life who wish to request a copy should send a letter to Mr. Yuan Fengju, the chief editor of the book, at Feng Ming Advertising Agency on the fifth floor of the Great World, and it will be sent to them.</p>

<p>(1) The large set of Xu Ziyuan's villa in Qingdao for "Peach Blossoms After the Calamity," written by Hong Shen and directed by Zhang Shichuan, has been under construction for three weeks and has not yet been completed, which shows its greatness. The pavilions, terraces, flowers, and trees are luxuriant. It is estimated that there will be as many as twenty-one scenes in this part of the play.</p>
<p>(2) The sound photography studio of the Star General Factory has been actively underway in recent days, and it is expected to be completed by the end of the lunar year.</p>
<p>(3) Ye Qiuxin and Wang Zhengxin, the leading actors of "Love Letter," and others have recently been shooting outdoor scenes at the General Factory, wearing thin summer costumes, which can be said to be the ultimate sacrifice. Someone asked how it tasted after the filming? They replied: We know it ourselves.</p>
<p>(4) When filming at the entrance of the alley for "Spring Flowers," Old Gao played the role of a down-and-out person, wearing a broken Western suit bought from the Wusong Foreign Firm for one dollar and two cents.</p>
<p>(5) Because Hu Die is on vacation during her honeymoon, the filming of her scenes in "Brothers" has been temporarily put on hold, and Zhu Qiuhen's scenes will be filmed first.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Drama and Film Research Institute at Jiangwan Road Park Fang officially started classes on the 27th of this month. All professors arrived on time to teach, and the students were also very orderly. For the purpose of conducting extracurricular joint research, the students of the institute established a student association on the 29th and organized various research groups, such as the literary and art research group, etc. The school hired experts and celebrities to be responsible for guidance, and there are academic lectures every week, creating a very prosperous atmosphere.</p>

<h3 id="e246">New Contributions to Analyzing the Reasons for the Decline of Industry and Commerce in the Midst of the Economic Downturn <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>A Wake-Up Call to Expose the Causes of Decline A Morning Bell to Awaken Self-Reliance</p>
<p>Since the European economic panic spread to China, the phenomenon of economic downturn in Shanghai has become increasingly serious. Factories and shops have closed down one after another. Enthusiastic people are all anxious and racking their brains to find ways to save the situation. Yi Hua Film Company specially produced the play "Heroes of the Times" for this purpose. The play has a very clear description of the reasons for the decline of commerce and industry, especially the oppression of national capital by international capital, which can be thought-provoking. It is a wake-up call to dissect the reasons for the decline of commerce and industry, and it is enough to awaken the self-reliance of all sectors of society. It is now said that the film will be released soon at the Jincheng Grand Theater, and all industrial and commercial sectors unanimously praise the company for being able to make good use of film propaganda methods to do its best to appeal for the sake of industry and commerce.</p>

<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>The Shanghai Tianyi Film Company's advertisement for recruiting actresses has the following conditions: (1) Age 18 to 22 years old, (2) Good-looking and beautiful, (3) Junior high school education, (4) Fluent Mandarin, (5) Height about four and a half feet, (6) Healthy physique, (7) Must have parental consent. An additional condition is that those from other places should not apply.</p>
<p>Since Mr. Shao Zuiweng went south to shoot Cantonese white mythological films, the Shanghai factory has long been empty. "Sea Burial" and "Mother" have also not sold well, so there is talk of sending Gao Tianqi to Hong Kong (of course, still to be in charge of publicity). Now, the Shanghai side has suddenly posted an advertisement for recruiting actresses, which is puzzling. Is it a whim of Zuiweng, or a consistent policy of "advertising gimmick"?</p>
<p>In terms of the conditions for recruiting actresses, it also feels contrary to our movie queen Ms. Chen Yumei. Does Mr. Shao, one of the world's three major directors, really feel that his wife is rotten wood that cannot be carved, and wants to promote new talents?</p>
<p>In the sound of "Communication by Telegram," the poet Miss Zhang Zhiyun was discovered again. Please see yesterday's Times for her great work. (External Historian, please note that this is a bit of free advertising.)</p>
<p>The editor of "Camera" has changed, and the new "Shaker" is "Idle Talk on Horseback" Tang Yu.</p>
