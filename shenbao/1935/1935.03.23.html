<p>— 仁</p>
<p>中國經濟界之落入於愁雲慘霧中者。三年於茲。而朝野人士之昕夕設法以謀其重振者。亦三年於茲。然而三年以來繁榮之曙光。迄猶未現。前途暗澹。莫可究詰。最近工商業。界發表金融問題報吿書一篇。（原文見三月十四日本報）洋洋數萬言。痛陳時弊。語多切要。而於申述中國之不宜通貨膨。脹尤有卓。見該文結論。以爲中國恐慌欲使其弛緩。必須自銀錢市塲及資本市塲之改良入手。換言之。卽主張一方面提倡票據貼現。他方面流通產業證劵。</p>
<p>顧票據貼現之不盛行。產業證券之不普遍。誠無可諱言其爲我國過去經濟界之一大弱點。故對於此種制度之提倡。亦誠爲今後改善中國經濟界切要之圖。但所可慮者。卽在極度恐慌之今。日此種制度。是否有實現之可能性。卽勉强以人力實現之。是否足以解救今日之恐慌。此亦値得討論之問題也。</p>
<p>我國自民二十以後。先之以農業衰落。繼之以工商凋敝。再繼之以金融界之恐慌。故三年來之國民經濟。有每况愈下之趨勢。洎乎今日。國民購買力已愈轉愈小商。業市塲亦已愈轉愈狹於。是往日之以賬面信用買賣。者至此賬面債權遂成爲呆滯。賬面之呆滯。實爲恐慌之結果。而非恐慌之原因。故在今日之情形下。提倡票據貼現。恐亦不過僅爲轉換恐慌之結果。而不能解决恐慌之原因。蓋票據貼現制度之實行。不過爲改往日之賬面信用爲票據信用而巳。過去工商業之賬面信用。因恐慌而流於呆滯。設恐慌之原因不能解除。則今後之票據信用。豈非仍可以因恐慌而使銀行資金呆滯。乎信用之爲物。不問其爲賬面。抑或票據。皆建立於工商之基礎上。而尤貴乎能流通工。商不振。則信用縮小而呆滯。工商繁榮。則信用膨脹而流通。故在經濟景氣之時。票據信用之優於賬面信用者正多。而在經濟恐慌之時。則兩者均有趨於呆滯之憂。在貼現制度下可以貼現者。爲期票。爲匯票。而貼現之期間。長則二三月。短則四五日。卽爲到期。過長則銀行資金呆滯。於此縱令有中央銀行可爲重貼現。則其爲期亦不能超過於二三月。故票據之貼現。對於資金一時之週轉爲有效。而於長期之流通爲無助。今日中國工商業賬面之呆滯。斷非一時之呆滯。故卽令票據貼現制度成立亦僅能行之於一次。而不能行之於再次。若銀行一次貼現而到期無着。則對於二次之貼現。必將視爲畏途而難於承受。至於跟單押匯之貼現。似乎較爲穩全。但在今日物價續落之時。恐亦未必能有把握。銀行絲繭押欽之損失。猶爲最近過去之事實也。由此而論。貼現制度之不盛行。誠爲中國經濟界之弱點。今後宜求其發展。但在今日恐慌之際。其發展之可能性殊不多。卽能相當推行。恐亦未能弛緩今日之恐慌。良以信用呆滯爲恐慌之結果。而非恐慌之原因也。</p>
<p>其次須討論者。爲產業證券在今日之能否普遍。夫產業證券之能否普遍。所受於環境之影響者甚大產。業證券制度欲求其普遍。則產業必先求其能鞏固。更須先求其能獨立然後投。資者自衆。證券之流通自廣。若今日中國之情形。則外來之勢力與內在之不振。兩相夾攻。使產業絕少發展之可能。產業之發展旣不易。產業證券之流通自難暢達前者爲因。而後者爲果。前者若能改良。則後者自能普遍。先治其。本然後可以齊其末故。在恐慌壓力之下。此種制度。　恐尙難一蹴可幾也。</p>
<p>綜上所論。吾人於貼現制度及產業證券制度之提倡。誠無間言所欲提出商榷者。卽吾人以爲此種制度之實行。必須兼顧恐慌原因之解除。若僅以此爲解救恐慌原因之唯一手段。恐費力多而成功少。結果徒事倍而功半耳。</p>

<p>歸途隨筆</p>
<p>在歸途中、自哈密至蘭州、雖係舊地重遊、然亦有前行觀感未及之處、固定一書、尙百讀不厭、西北邊疆、文化地利、多未啟發、芸芸衆生、濟濟萬物、生滅消長、一聽自然支配、前此未經發現之珍奇、正不知尙有凡幾、漢陽關及鎖陽古城、早已湮沒於黃沙白草中、而關外人咸稱「每遊其地一次、至少必拾古物一件、或磚、或瓦、或小佛、或寳鼎、不一而足、」申而言之、不僅陽關鎖陽如是、整個西北邊疆、殆莫不如是、是以記者此行、所獲深刻感想、惟覺如過寳山、雖無大刀利斧、鑿山而入、窮其富美之蘊藏、但卽窺其外表、舉凡草瑞花琪、露潤氣爽、林木葱茂、沙石晶瑩、石油湧現於溝壑、煤鹽更緣山麓而暴露、已足令人低徊流連、心旌搖曳不巳矣、</p>
<p>一別載有萬古之雪的天山美、走過山勢盤陀沙河宛委之猩猩峽、蜿蜓甘靑省界之祁連山、又復展其蔚藍恬靜之笑容、默然欣迓於數百里外、祁連峯巓、亦有積雪、惟色作灰白、不似天山雪光之遐邇瑩然也、按山雪愈積愈多、下層壓力加大、擠出空氣、緊縮體量、恰當冰點或冰點以下之溫度、依「復冰現象」變巨大冰塊、因山勢傾斜、及地心吸力、冰塊滑溜於下、再成「冰河」、斜掛山澗、若垂匹練、晶瑩明亮之反對、雪光得之而益彰、祁連雪　、多無冰河、有之、亦可翻淘砂金、天　高於祁連、所有冰河、深厚往往不可　、冰河流動速度、極爲慢緩、（以科學方法試探、卽可詳知究竟）流至溫度較高之山谷中、盡端卽有極少量之冰、溶解滴淋、而成水河、惟不易成爲巨流、甚有旋被蒸發者、天山雪冰化水、則多汨沒於原山中、另於平原流出、或用坎井掘獲、水利之宏大、亦非祁連所及、蓋不僅雪光皎潔、大有差別耳、</p>
<p>時值殘冬、天氣嚴寒、新甘交界之猩猩峽、旅次宿夜、正値雪後、尤其風凜氣冷、記者爲欲趕搭安西商幫汽車、特備四騎、與馬主各騎其一、餘二馬則載糧料、（兵焚後沿途無買處）兼程並進、拂曉卽發、日沒未宿、猩猩峽站、係連走兩個九十里之大站、到時已在二更後、無旅舍人家、特入關帝廟內、扣郵差門借宿、應聲始知內非郵差、乃一登記甘新來往郵件之郵員、據稱渠甫「靜坐下丹」、恐爲冷風所吹、僅由窓縫中、遞出廚房鑰匙及洋火、囑自開門烹食、廚房中有碗筷鍋具、及駝糞燃料、惟空缸無水、出寺外尋井不見、又無第二人之指導、只好融院雪以飲馬、幷袋濾之以煮麵、食後碗底微着洗水、置案上片刻卽冰住、始悟空缸不蓄水者、以免冰凍無用、且壞其器也、翌晨睡眼朦朧、頓覺面部微觸溫意、啟視則見馬主携一燃燭、走近臥側、燭光輕輕照面、卽覺微微溫意、夜氣冰冷如何、可以反證得之矣、四馬繫於露天槽柱、噓氣凝霜於唇毛、老馬更滴涎成冰、交錯如犬牙、後俟郵員起而導拾水晶及星星石、幷爲指點煤礦所在處、且行且談、據言、渠名王英烈、魯籍、曾入同善社、特來此杳無人烟處、謀此淸閒事、藉以靜養、彼言時恒手顫頭搖、詢其是否曾受大驚、抑受重大刺戟、渠答、前赫定博士一行過宿於此、某君亦稱渠有痰病、實則道高三尺、魔高一丈、渠得此病、乃因靜坐所致、繼詢其旣知病源、何不中止靜坐、彼置不答、時適有野馬驚逃、遂顧而言他、謂此間野馬及狐狼兎獸甚多、淸晨登高遙看、殊覺有趣、野馬間有爲獵者所馴、惟脊軟不能騎載云、</p>
<p>到達安西、甫卸鞍轡、舊友某君爲吿記者前次過安、已替安人惹下大禍、駭而詢故、某君謂「君之西北視察記、略述安西出產土鹽事、詎甘肅榷運局閱報後、立電安西縣長、令速詳明查覆、目的在設局徵稅、該土鹽遠產草湖、質色均屬不良、惟少數赤貧蒙民、勉以化水調味、實不配稱食鹽、前此鄰封敦玉兩縣、亦因稍產士鹽、被榷局偵知、始則專員徵收、終以入不敷出、改由縣府附徵、不管農民賣鹽與不賣鹽、吃得起鹽與吃不起鹽、均須按戶攤派、按季一律繳欽、至今地方受累不堪、况安西人口原有九百戶、卽因逃避重稅、今僅勝五百餘戶、若再加徵監稅、安民將無瞧類」云云、記者行踪所至、務必諮訪特產、吿諸國人、意在喚起各方之注意、研究開發與改進、以盡地利、不謂竟以惹禍、致地方有懷壁之憂、誠非始料所及、此實不勝遺憾也、</p>

<p>金融平定匯水已跌　貨擁客多各加班次　招商局正計議添航</p>
<p>川河航業、衰落已久、今次自中央軍入川、將共匪擊潰後、商業頓趨發達、金融亦形穩固、打破數年來陰霾沉悶之氣、亟將近情報吿如下、</p>
<p>金融暢通</p>
<p>上年川商停止辦貨、原因爲申匯匯水漲至一千七百元、上海去貨、價格加增一倍以上、益以川中內地不靖、以致各帮相率止運去貨、航輪聯帶受損、近經中央運銀入渝、金融流通、匯價平復、刻下川洋匯滬祇須一千零四十元、卽可合滬洋一千元、由是川中各商帮、近已紛紛電滬、令上海坐莊各號、暢辦運川去貨、</p>
<p>貨擁增輪</p>
<p>在川盤踞多年之共匪、已經中央軍與川軍擊潰、各匪區陸續收復、差用輪已先後退租、川河內崆領拕之水勢又漲、已可通行吃水八九尺之江輪、民生捷江太古怡和及三北等、均各增派上江輪船、行駛四川上海、去貨大增、洋雜貨及棉紗已在擁裝中矣、</p>
<p>旅客大增</p>
<p>自蔣委員長至重慶後、川河一路往來旅客平增、此較往時可增多倍、致供過於求、民生捷江三北等川河輪之客票收入、均各大增、爲川河輪近二十年來所罕有、打破空前紀錄、</p>
<p>招商復航</p>
<p>招商局川河輪、自峨嵋失事後、卽無輪行、至今峨嵋輪尙未修復、漢宜綫內僅一快利輪、上年全年祗得一萬八千餘元之水脚、（上江綫）較太古怡和不及八分之一、現正上江輪復振之良機、宜昌重座各分局、已紛電滬總局、請求迅速增派川河輪、以補充峨嵋班、而免坐棄巨利、放失良機、劉鴻生經理對此、巳在計議增輪、復航川河矣、</p>

<p>— 德國圖書館委員傑琴博士著</p>
<p>德國的科學界和中國的學術界雖然東西遙隔、可是兩國之間科學的聯繫、在近幾年間、不但非常密切、甚且互匡不逮、中國的靑年到德國去留學的、與年俱增、德國的大學敎授到中國研究機關來講學的、亦復逐歲加多、德國的科學傳播全球、在土耳其和南美洲諸國、更有完全依照德國的精神和方法來創辦的大學、而這一類大學所聘請的敎授、又以德國人爲多、中國和德國的文化、有很顯明的相同處、至於純科學思想方法的出發點、更完全相同、雙方本着這種精神、在密切聯絡之下、自然能彀繼續收獲最偉大的效果、中國不乏通曉德國文字語言的知名之士、即如、國民政府的交通部長前敎育部長朱家驊氏、便是曾在德國大學研究工業的一人、這是一般德國人所引爲欣幸的一點、德國始終努力於更密切的聯絡、且努力地充分利用這種聯絡、以期造福於雙方、</p>
<p>本文所述、初不在詳叙中德間密切聯絡的情况、而在簡單地說明富爲一般人所忽視的一點、這一點雖不被人們重視、但實含有經久而重要的意義、那末、這究是什麼呢、就是德國的科學和中國圖書館的關係、本文是以德國學術互助會爲立塲的、</p>
<p>德國學術互助會、是德國研究學術的中心機關、互助會的職志、在從事於科學的研究、且依照他規定的範圍和意志、來同外國發生關係、因爲在本國已經獲得良好的成績、所以進而要爲中國的知識界樹立隱固的基礙、要貫澈使德國圖書館熱悉中國情形的素志、且爲要與注意歐洲文及語言的中國各大圖書館密切聯絡起見、在交互往反之中早巳獲得中國各方面的友誼的酬答、中國幅員廣大、要詳細叙述各方面聯絡的情形、當然不是本文的範圍所許、所以這裏叙述所及、不過幾個最主要的機關、以及互助會在這方面努力的經過情形而已、</p>
<p>先就上海而論、這時候正有九千冊的德文書籍由互助會寄贈被日本士兵所毀、現在正在復興中的東方圖書館、這一批書籍業已從德國向中國寄發、爲便於讀者飽覽新德意志的重要書籍計、這裏收集着各方面關於敍述德人過去現在的苦鬥事實的專著、這一類書耤、都附有富麗堂皇的神話和故事的挿圖、且有最新式的工廠建　物的圖影、又有一部分是敘述德國合作社的、這種合作社是歐洲唯一的完善設備、且爲全歐的模範、每年到德國來參觀這種設備的、人數很多、道一類書籟裏面雷有挿圖、雖然德文程度較淺的讀者、祇要開卷流覽以後、便不難窺見德國精神的所寄、和德國偉大文化的所在、其中更有一部份是關於德國法律的這一類書籍、都可以視爲現代法律書的圭皋、再就其他各方面說、則非代表之作不收、這一類的著作、都是在互助會補助之下的、不輕見的科學試騐、且爲便於中國專家的使用而集之作、至於一部份版本較舊的書籟、那都是科學冢和圖書館所寄贈的、從這一類書籟、可以知道互助會的對於古本、也未嘗不兼收並蓄、希望讀者溫故而知新、這便是收入古本的目的、尙有一部份是德國的詩集、愛好詩詞的中國人士、讀此或者更能了解德國的本質、</p>

<p>— 棲鳳樓主</p>
<p>春已到了人間的呼聲，一般人已經喊久了，春是一年中最可愛的季節，因為它一切的一切，都是予人們以愉快和愛懲，這當然能獲得羣眾熱烈歡迎！不過芳春九十，當它在初步姍姍降臨之始，那時候是嚴肅蕭瑟的殘冬，方逝去了未久，大地雖號着春回，可是寒威正盛，誰都呼着料峭春寒，那還是美中不足，及至暮春三月，草長鶯飛，它又將毫不留戀地要歸去了，徒然使傷春者增加了無限的惆悵！也許有人感喟着「春歸人未歸」的調子，獨有那仲春天氣，草木已由萌芽時期而進於　茂時代，而那靑峰碧波，更顯示着柔和嫵媦的姿態，尤其是杏花雨裏，沾衣欲濕，楊柳風前，吹面不寒，正彷彿妙齡女郎，盈盈欲笑，啊！這美麗的大自然，委實使人陶醉的喲！</p>
<p>「一年之計在於春」，這是誰也知道的，可是能有幾人，在春光中努力？現在是春去已半了，一轉眼是水流花落春光老，黃金何處買芳年啊！雖然春之神是和顏悅色地對着羣眾，但它是守紀律化的，祇知道勇往直前！從不遲疑過一刻一分！也許它就是良師益友，循循善誘，使人們向正軌勇猛前進，偏是人們不能了解它的苦心！只知乘着和風麗日，各個人晏安嬉遊，還美其名曰「及時行樂，」更有為着無謂之事，而放棄了人生重大的使命，去幹那自戕自盡的絕路，這未免太辜負了大好的春光吧？</p>

<p>— 康健齋夫</p>
<p>鯨魚，在海洋裏，一向有「天下無敵」的王者氣象。可是到了這個年頭，它似乎已變成「甕中之　」了。</p>
<p>從前捕鯨的工具不利，獵鯨的方法，還算是明槍交戰的，鯨魚儘多脫逃的機會：自從有轟炸式的魚叉一來，用的是暗殺手段，那龐然大物，竟不得不束手就擒了。據說那爆炸的魚叉，重有一百二十磅，裏面藏有二十八磅的炸藥，大凡體重約八十噸乃至一百噸的鯨魚，未有不一觸卽死的。</p>
<p>目下北冰洋裏的鯨魚，幾已被挪威漁人捉得精光。南極洋裏捕鯨艦有二十艘，通常小的捕鯨漁船也有一百五十艘。預料在本年夏季之前，可以有三萬條鯨魚請它們登陸觀光，受著鯨魚工塲的屠宰。挪威人在南極洋上當著鯨魚的劊子手的有六千人之多。除非獵鯨艦隊體念著上天好生之德，網開一面，那世界上所有的鯨魚在不久的數年之內，便有子孫消滅的危險。茫茫大海，竟沒有它容身之地呢！</p>
<p>史前的大動物，例如恐龍之類，早已絕跡於世界。現存的大動物，鯨魚好算是首屈一指。倘若眞個隨著恐龍之類而不久消滅，也算是生物學史上一件深可惋惜的事啊。然而誰敎你本身裏面蘊蓄著這麼令人豔羨的脂膏，而沒有一點抵抗自衛的能力的呢！</p>

<p>繭子打　內摘取下來之後、最殘忍的一幕便出現了！他們不顧　蛹的生死，一起把　子丟下那沸水中云，活活地將那蠶　蛹死。蠶子在沸水內浸了一兩個　頭之後，便得用一個竹製的短帝不停的攪着，掩到有一個繭子上可以拍出一根絲頭來了，便停了攬，先把它緊在一根細繭子，絲完了，再把第二個繭子的絲接上一面攪，一個繭子，絲完了，再把第二個繭子的絲接上去，如此便可以得到一絞一絞的生絲了。我看那些女孩子們弄得有趣，便自告奮勇的去試了半晌，結果一根絲頭也攪不出來；當然，這種工作也得經過相當的學習的！從這一點上看來，做絲的人也可算是一種具有專門技術的藝工。不過我却並不羨慕伊們，我祇覺得蠶這一樣東西的生存，確乎是最有趣不過的，因此很想再澈底研究研究。</p>
<p>「老佛爺，我還有些不明白，」凑太后高興的當兒，我就向伊請問：「旣然這些　繭子都泡過了，那末到明年我們又從那裏去討到蠶子來呢？」</p>
<p>這是不用愁的！我們早就揀出一部份專供留種的繭子來了。」伊很耐煩地給我解釋道：「那繭子裏面的蛹還會變化咧！我們只要不燙死它，隔了相當的日子，它就會變成蠶蛾了。這些蠶蛾是决不肯再在繭子裏躱着的，它們就自動的把繭子咬破了一個小洞，鑽將出來；有時候那些育蠶的女孩子還會帮着它們，把那繭子撕破，使它們得以早些鑽出來……」（二七五）</p>

<p>— 淸癯</p>
<p>前本報載華聯社芝加哥訊，有西女麥居亞，年二十九歲，自一九三二年二月十五日，披衣欲出街之際，忽然暈倒，橫臥榻上，此後即合眼長睡，歷三十三月不醒，咸稱之為長睡美人。雖羣醫亦莫知為何症。今歲一月間，其母米利夫人，發覺女能張目，喜甚，舉筆寫字以示，果認識無訛。於是誼傳遐邇，謂久睡之病，有痊可之望云云。余按睡而成病，且病至深久者，不獨麥居亞其人，試述一斑，藉諗閱者。</p>
<p>考人之所以欲睡，其大原因，由於精神之困憊，故過勞則疲，疲斯倦矣。其次則為寂寞，又次則為胃困，否則為常態。蓋動物無不睡之理，魚在水中，縱極活潑，不能休息，特睡有長短，是以醒亦有難易之別。酣睡之際，雖鉦鼓聒耳不聞，假寐之時，即戶外屨聲，亦跫然能辨其人，此睡之深淺，而覺醒繫焉。至睡以病稱，則非困憊，寂寞胃困，而亦異於常態。昔法國有貴族某婦，自一千八百八十三年起息此症，竟垂十六年之久，奄奄一息，不啻癱瘓，驟視似死矣，實木死也。每秒鐘猶能脈搏八十次，然搖撼之，面茫然不覺，與之食，則飲湯水少許，不與之，亦不知索，經醫治，謂人身細絡以千萬計，舒則醒，合則睡，此婦之絡，恒合不舒，故常睡不醒。其說頗有見地，而不能斷為定論。</p>
<p>斐洲基納　地，士人昔有染此睡病者，一臥四年，不離牀第，而恒與　枕為緣，且口常閉，不復需飲食，有呼之為『活仙人』者，家人以乳酪等物，注鼻管以入胃，延其殘喘，後醫者因是發明『援命器』以試之，蓋其人之睡，一如其人之死，以此器置胸部，稍有呼吸，器即隨之而動，藉覘其生死，甚至確已死矣，而猶疑其非真死，須經撿騐。然後人殮，亦可見睡症之嚴重，有如是者。此次麥居亞睡至兩年有九月，經此長時期之黑甜鄉生活，其母一旦見其眼球能轉動，而取紙筆寫字於字，謂『汝豎起一指，』女徐徐應之，繼寫『汝豎二指，』女又應之，無或有爽，由是知其蘇醒，非復若睡夢中人。然此猶不能無疑焉，試據一說以明之</p>
<p>凡人注視孩提，或懦弱之人，儻直對其目，立時神情可變為恍惚，而失其主觀，　在斯時，而告以汝在山，則其人忽覺身臨絕壑，告以汝在水，則其人亦如身入大海，授以苦物，而指為甘，則眞若甘者，與以堅物，而謂為柔，則眞若柔者，五官四體，胥可置之被動之列，人但知催眠，然亦能催醒。故麥居亞一時之覺醒，是否其母之心理所攝引，亦是問題，故余略述之，以供世之能研究此病者之一助也。</p>

<p>第十一回　夜話凄凉生涯原是夢履痕零亂風雨太欺人</p>
<p>大凡一個人，無論在成功的時候，或者在失敗的時侯，那眞情的流露，是最容易得別人同情的。楊浣花把偷錢的原因，說了出來，賈多才的心，就軟了一半。加上他又哭得很凄慘，就不忍再說他了，便歎了一口氣道：說起來，我們總是江南人，你流落在這地方，我們不能不携帶你一點。可是你把實情對人說了，讓人家規規矩矩帮你一點忙，不比你這樣胡亂下身分，要好得多嗎？楊浣花將身子偏着，掏出手絹來，擦了一擦眼睛，因道：賈先生，你這話自然是對的。可是我也走過這條路，那是不通的。我雖然是背夫逃走出來的，那也不過一時之錯，我並不是拿身體去換錢的人。無奈不…不…不這樣，他說不下去了。哽因着，又在瘦削的臉腮上，滾着兩粒淚珠。賈多才心旣是軟了，也就覺得他越說越可憐，在他這樣流淚的時侯，也只有呆呆的看住了他。楊浣花他是在社會上有此磨鍊了，一看賈多才的樣子，有些感動，心想只是對人哭，那沒有什麼意思。哭久了，也許還要討人煩膩的。這樣轉了一個念頭，他立刻就把眼滬擦去了。勉强的向賈多才笑道：賈先生，你饒了我嗎？賈多才道：我一不是法官。二不是警察，我有什麼權柄，可以不饒你。剛才的事，不必談了，好在我也並沒有什麼損失，楊院花站起來道：旣是這樣說，我就可以回去了。（一六四）</p>

<p>— 明寰</p>
<p>關於試騐振盪器的應用，製造等方法，本刊以前已很詳細的介紹過，惟所述的，僅涉及高週率範圍，本篇擬專述中間週率試騐振盪器的種種，原理雖同，但無論構造，應用，尤其是週率較準法，頗多不同之點，自有另行說明之必要。</p>
<p>超外差式收昔機成績固佳，構造亦較複雜，因其特有的中間週率級，極難較配，許多業餘同志，對於自製超外差式機，多感畏縮，卽有試之老，成績亦鮮能滿意，主要的原因，在於缺少精確的試騐扳盪器，以較準其中間週率級的綫路，使與其預定的中間週率符合。</p>
<p>廠製的超外差式機，雖經幾度精密的較騐，方始出售，但此後或因種種影響，失却其原來的諧振狀態，以致百病叢生，例如音量微弱，或刻度盤前半段的電臺極響，後半段却極弱有時中段電臺極響，兩端變弱，此外復有狂呌聲，以及同一電臺，在兩個以上度數處出現等等障碍，大都均由於中間週率級，調整失當所致，如果檢騐超外差式機，僅憑測量電壓和電阻，那麼，無論你的電表如何精確，决不能尋出這些病因之由來，所以修理超外差式機，而無精確的中間週率試騐振盪器，簡直束手無策</p>
<p>中間週率振盪器不難於製造，而難於週率的較準，（Calibrate）因廣播週率振盪器的週率，可利用許多廣播電臺的訊號較準之，短波振盪器亦可參考各短波電臺訊號較準之，惟有中間週率範圍內，絕無現成之訊號可利用，幸而有個簡捷的方法，僅需一架普通的廣潘收音機，便可解决這難題。</p>
<p>茲先述一簡單中間週率振盪器的構造，綫路如圖所示，各件的容量巳在圖中註明，任何三極眞空管，均可適用，調整綫圈可在一吋四分之一直徑的膠管上以二十號雙紗包綫，每層十四圈，共繞十四層，中分綫頭可在第九十八圈處接出，交連圈可繞在調整圈外層，約六圈足矣。</p>
<p>振盪器製成後，第二步卽須較準其週率，先以振盪器輸出兩端接廣播收音機的天地接綫，振盪器的調整電容器旋至中心處，於是徐徐轉動收音機的調整電容器，直至揚聲器內產生尖呌聲，此時表示收音機已與振盪器的副波（Harmonic）諧振，在尋求此諧振點時，必先在振盪器的屏極上，加以交流電壓，使之調幅，或使收音機先自生振盪方可，否則，不能覓得此諧振點，尤以後法爲精確，任何收音機，祇須設法增加屏柵極的交連密度，極易振盪。</p>
<p>第一次副波諧振點尋得後，卽將此時收音機的準確週率數錄出，繼續旋轉收音機電容器，至尖呌聲重復出現爲止，此爲相鄰副波的諧振點，收音機兩諧振點的週率差數，卽振盪器之基本週率，例如欲使振盪器之週率爲175KC須逐漸變動其調整電容器，使收音機兩諧振點的週率差數，適爲175KC。</p>
<h3 id="c194">低週率變壓器接法種種 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 擎石</p>
<p>一只中等的變壓器，倘若使用的方法適當，必常可獲得良好結果。牠的接連法有很多種，祇要曉得了各種用法的效果，那麼，便可選擇那最適宜的施用。在這篇短文裏，我且把低週率變壓器的主要接連法寫出來，讓一般業餘者逐一試騐任意選擇，而不必暗中摸索。</p>
<p>在第一類試騐中，可藉以確定出所要採用的變壓器最佳變壓比。蓋用各種變壓器（一比一的除外），都可得四種不同的比例。第一圖所示，爲變壓器的通常接法。前一眞空管的屏極，接初級的P，B則直接或經過一只耗阻而通到了電池的正極。次管的柵極，應接次級的G，而F則接丙電池的負極。</p>
<p>我們也可把那變壓器裝成自動變壓式（Autotransformer）·這祇要把初級的B，和次級的F相聯起來。在這　結合中，就是把全只綫圈聯合起來做次級，而其初級，則用原有的初級，（圖二）或原有的次級（圖三）。</p>
<p>譬如我們有一只一比二的變應器，那末在圖一一中，便可把牠變做一此三。而在圖三，則牠的比例數是二比三，換句話說，就是一比一·五。</p>
<p>最後，我們也一樣的可以把那自動變壓器，臨時作一比一來用，這祇要如圖四的裝接起來，這一種連接的名稱，就是呌做混合阻力容量耗阻（Impedance—capacity—resistance）</p>
<p>在圖二，三，四中，電容器法的容量，約爲·〇〇五至·〇五兆分C拉特，洩漏耗阻R，約爲二十萬至一兆歐姆。（須試騐而定）</p>
<p>現在，我們又得注意，倘若前一眞空管的電流，超過三個千分盎配時，則變壓器的磁心就會發生飽和作用，以致收音失眞。那麼此較適宜的方法，是把屏極電流的交流成分，與牠的直流成分分隔開來，而祇讓前一種在變壓器的繞綫中通過。</p>
<p>圖五的裝置，便可誕我們得到這種隔離。直流電流穿過那耗阻R（可擇一間於三萬至十萬歐姆的），而交流，則容易通過那結合電容器C這樣便不會引起飽和作用了。</p>
<p>耗阻R的數量，是和前一眞空管的內耗阻，與其屏極所用的電壓的最高度相關連的。所以最好是經過試騐之後才决定。</p>
<p>此外圖五，六，七，八，是和圖一，二，三，四相互關連的至於試騐比較的方法，最好不用收音，而用一只拾音器，每次都用同一的唱片，和一根新的唱針。</p>
<h3 id="c195">鉛鋁整流瑣談 <a href="#c195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— 梁應昌</p>
<p>（一）鉛鋁整流上所用之藥品，以重炭酸鈉和碼砂兩　較爲普通；重炭酸鈉溶解時可得較濃之溶液，工作成績優於碼砂。</p>
<p>（二）普通規定應用蒸溜水，此或化學實騐室常用蒸溜水之故，因其不含雜質，使用可靠，其實普通凈水亦可同樣工作。</p>
<p>（三）鉛片和鋁片至少須高出水面一吋，否則工作時接綫之銅質螺絲極易沾染溶液；銅質螺絲染到溶液後便生化學作用，能阻止電流之通行，成績因而减低，或致工作停息。</p>
<p>（四）經整流後之電壓尙變幻不定，非另加器具不能量出其弗打數，不過整流後之電流已成爲單向性，此可以電流表測出。</p>
<p>（五）全波整流使用不易，因各瓶（全波整流最少須用整流器二瓶）之內阻應當相等；不然，各瓶所出之電力相差甚遠。欲使全波整流盡量發揮其效力，則各瓶鉛鋁之大小，距離，以及溶液之厚薄應完全相同。</p>
<p>（六）六鉛鋁整流器最大之弊端，爲極易發熱和鋁片損蝕極速。避免方法，惟有加大鉛鋁之面積和增加溶液，一方則减低充電速率。大約每瓶有一升左右之溶液，一百平方吋之鉛鋁，通以一安培之電流，方可持久而不發熱。</p>
<p>（七）爲防止溶液之蒸發，某書敎人於溶液上面加油一層，法殊不善，蓋使用此種整流器第一須防止其發熱，溶液之蒸發，乃散放其本身之勢力，加油後溶液之發熱反速。</p>
<p>（八）善通規定每瓶整流器能受電壓爲五十弗打，於一百弗打處使用須兩瓶串連：實則通過電流如有相當限制，不令整流器發生高熱，於一百弗打處僅用一瓶工作亦可不致損壞。</p>
<p>（九）用鉛鋁整流時，不論用變莊器或直接接至交流電源，均須防止電源斷電後之放電，故無發日電之所，當發電廠斷電前應卽停止充電。</p>
<p>（十）整流器工作後，鉛鋁上所積之白色物質應卽淸除，以免减低工作效力。用後之溶液可傾去沉澱而保存其淸潔者，下次再加重炭酸鈉少許仍可續用，但不宜儲藏過久。</p>
<h3 id="c196">檢騐鉛板蓄電池之又一器具 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 王懋生</p>
<p>檢騐鉛板蓄電池常用之器具爲比重表或電壓表。茲復有一鎘試騐器（Cadmium　tester），不僅能測出電壓之數値，並能檢查正負兩電板放電與充電之狀况。其搆造如第一圖，係一電壓表，二銅桿，及一鎘條合成。鎘條與銅桿成直角電壓表之分度，如第二圖。</p>
<p>試騐時，將鎘條挿入硫酸中，但不得與正負兩電板接觸，停留片刻。試騐正電板時，則其他一銅桿，宜　淤正極上，試騐負電板時，則其他一銅桿，宜觸於負極上。錩條挿入硫酸後，則起局部化學作用，而生電壓，此電壓之大小，卽能表現二電板之優劣與否。其値如下：</p>
<p>（一）充電時　正極2.3v－2.45v（小於此數，正極電板有病</p>
<p>負極（0.iv）—（0.2v）（近於〇或在〇數以上者，負極電板有病，）</p>
<p>（二）放電時　正極約2，05v　負極0.25v　較比值爲</p>
<p>少時，電板有病，卽須充電，以上所示數値，第二圖電壓表上已表明之。</p>
<p>Neg　Discharged　指放電時之負極，，Charged　指充電時之負極Pos　Discharged　指放電時之正極，，　Charged指充電時之正極</p>
<p>至於蓄電池之電壓算法可舉一例說明之。</p>
<p>充電時　鎘與負極　電壓爲—0.1</p>
<p>鎘與正極　電壓爲十2.45</p>
<p>蓄電池之電壓＝2.45＋0.1＝2.45v放電時　　與負極電壓爲0,25</p>
<p>鎘與正極電壓爲2,05</p>
<p>蓄電池之電壓＝2.05—0.25＝1.81v</p>

<p>（一）經濟的金屬質底盤</p>
<p>收音機用金屬底盤，旣美觀，復便捷。尤其是交流收音機，更能因之免除令人厭惡的交流聲。惟此項金屬底盤，如用鋁板，價頗昂貴，殊不合一般業餘家之經濟條件。茲願貢獻一替代物，以供同志們的試用。</p>
<p>先覓一相當尺寸的鐵皮餅乾盒，（苟有其他適用之洋鐵皮盒，亦可。）將表面所貼之商標花紙洗去，或用砂皮擦凈。再以鋁粉（Al　luminrim　Powder）（俗稱鋁粉，各漆肆有售。）和以薄膠水塗上，塗時需均勻，庶平滑美觀。俟乾透後、卽成一實用之金屬底盤矣。</p>
<p>（一）巧妙的指度針</p>
<p>刻度盤上的指針、通常是在面板上刻一綫條，或用紙剪一尖形指示針，以表示之。前者有損面板，不甚妥當。後者更嫌簡陋，且一經汚損後，時有更損之麻煩。茲有一法，僅用普通圖畫釘一枚，撳於度盤邊綫卽成。圖釘中央之尖形缺孔，經面板之映襯，已自成一天然之指示針矣。（A爲圖釘、B爲刻度盤。）</p>

<p>— 楊學綸</p>
<p>業餘研究家之目的，莫不希冀自裝一架費用省，效率高之收音機。但是費用省，效率必不能高；效率高，費用必不能省，迨複作用眞空管問世，此難題已有相當之解决辦法，因複作用眞空管一管可以兼司二管以上之工作，所以其效率確較普通眞空管爲優，前讀申報無綫電週刋所載庸言與吳英劍二君之6F7的經濟交流二管機，鄙人隨卽購置一枚，照圖裝配，接收近地電台，音量確是　亮，可與普通三管機相比，但是上海各大電台，卽用聽筒，亦不能收到，不是再生力太强狂呌，卽卜的一聲，寂然無聞。後經多次拆裝，果然現其病源所在，誠如張壽毓君所述，簾柵電壓，不可高過檢波屏電壓也。茲將改裝後之綫路圖，以及收聽情形，詳述如下：</p>

<p>電源不論交直流皆可，倘用直流。，電可用6v蓄電池，或串聯四筒圓乾電A如係半交流式，可用電鈴變壓器改繞供給之。B電須用至135V.</p>

<h3 id="c217">志賀直哉的身邊小說 <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 張香山</p>
<p>從明治四十年以降，日本的文壇可以說是自然主義的最鋒芒時代，四十三年以後，雜誌「白樺」的出世，更激起了自然主義的巨嵐：當時的白樺底同人；以武者小　實篤和志賀直哉爲基本盟員，而志賀直哉的藝術之被一般的認識，也正當「白樺」雜誌之風　於文壇的時候。</p>
<p>如果讀者不健忘的話；會經哄動一時的「新村運動」，　　　還能憶起來的吧！所謂「白樺」雜誌，也就是這運動的機　誌，現在這運動雖雖然還徒存其各，而當時在短篇小說　獲得最人氣的，在這運動裏作着基本的盟員的志賀直哉，却在我孫子裏，過着平淡的老年生活，而簡直脫離了文學生涯了。</p>
<p>因看作者生活的平凡，而尤忠實於現實的生活，沒有左拉等進牢獄或酒店去體騐一般人的生活滋味之勇敢：於是那圍繞於作者自身的平凡生活，常成了掇拾不綴的創作資料了，以這種素材而創作出來的作品，可以稱謂身邊小說。身邊小說沒有雄飛的幻想，更無「無中生有」，以極自然的把一個作者的性格和生活給表現出來。</p>
<p>志賀直哉的小說，大都是短篇的小說，長篇恐怕祗有一篇「暗夜行路」吧！在他的短篇小說裏，可以說是十之七八是身邊小說，是志賀直哉的自身的生活。他的小說，我曾讀過了十之穴七，如果我不是個東方人，持有了東方人的敎養的話，由於志賀直哉的小說之平凡和素朴，的確是難以讀完其作品之一篇的。</p>
<p>除了身邊小說以外的諸篇，還是仍舊脫離不了他的平庸的撰擇，所謂膚淺的正義派，學徒，畸形的人們常如實地給他表現出來，像「范的犯罪」，「淸兵衛生葫蘆」，「學徒的上帝」等都是極好的例子；這些人們或是爲生存而戰戰兢兢，或是栓小義而不道其名，或是畸形的嗜好，或是路打不平，眞是所謂施小義的市井人，都很如實地描寫出來；這些人間，首尾地都是東方人的性格，尤其是最切合明治維新前後的一般町人生活者的速影，這種人而且是日本的關東男子，不是像谷崎潤一郞所表現的關西人物。淺顯地說還是「江戶（東京舊名）男兒型」。所謂德川時代的平民思想和尙俠的風氣下的產兒。</p>
<p>至於志賀直哉的身邊小說呢，大抵分作四型，一種是身上瑣事，一種是糊塗的旅行，一種是嗜好，一種是　綿而簡單的女人關係；所謂身上瑣事，是指的個人的像子和親屬等事，在這裏，他把掃孩子的墓，對於父親的憎恨以及母親的死和娶新母親的故專，做祖父的週忌而討厭祖母的心氣甚之於尋失狗等，都當作小說的題材，例如「和解」「謙作的追憶」「母死與新母」「某天早晨」「墨犬」等在在都是；這些故事大抵是童年的回憶，雖然過於乏味，但因爲是發洩於童年時的心理與現象，所以有一種稚拙而天眞的趣味。第二種是糊　旅行，所謂糊塗旅行是東西亂跑，常常帶着神精質而從關東到關西，從奈良到辛都，又時在京都城裏找尋住屋，而終日不得，甚之餓得脚都提不動而不肯在外購食，怕傳染一切流行症，眞是糊糊塗塗，宛如行路於夢中，例如「寓居」「鵠沼行」「興津」「第的歸京」「瑣事」「震災慰問」等。至於第三種的嗜好，是他的觀畫觀劇等的生活之內觀，他喜賞古畫，因此佛寺常成爲他的鑑賞處，無論在雨天，在風天，他可以約會友人去到佛寺參觀古畫，這種風流的行徑，還依舊地遣留着封建時代的文人的風流。例如「鳥尾的病」「廿代」面」等。第四種的女人愛戀事情，充分地暴露了作者的平凡。在這些愛戀事情裏，男主公是個怕老婆的人，但在外面仍舊作點浪漫的事情，有時甚至帶着極大的臆病，怕自己太太對於自己的猜測，他看到了自己女僕有了孕的徵候，如道女僕有了私通，但他怕自己太太疑到自己，因此而日夜不安，終於與太太吿白，這種膽小的主人公，使讀者感到極端的不耐煩；甚之他還更把女人的無可奈何的苦情，使男主人公感到戀愛的二重人格之痛苦。這些作品，可以舉「好人物的夫婦」，「痴情」「瑣事」晚秋」等爲例。</p>
<p>總之，我們觀看以上四種的形狀，可以極瞭然地明白了志賀直哉的性格：是個怯懦的，封建性的，多猜臆的人；因此這些環繞於他的身子周圍的故事，也是種極瑣的怯懦臆病等的故事。</p>
<p>曾經有個人評批志賀直哉，說「他過於有了安定的生活，如果他的生活是工人抑或農人的生活的話，則作品大有可觀了。」這個意見，我的確有點同意，以他的直越的自然主義的手腕，來描寫現狀的一般人的生活苦狀，總能够極其完善的，可惜環繞他週身的生活，是如此的志凡。</p>
<p>志賀直哉是不把文學當幟業的，而且蔑視把文學當作職業，因此對於創作的熱情，也並不太高，祇是把文學當作古來文士對詩詞的一樣態度。</p>
<p>自從一九三三年末，發表了篇同樣的某星期日的下午以後，巳經完會蟄伏似秋蟬了，然而他的平凡的索樸的自然主義的手法，却被人們認爲有檢討的必要，而志賀直哉時代的身邊小說，到現在還不絕的產生在現代文壇上，這的確是件可悲的事情。</p>
<h3 id="c218">希望 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 魏中天</p>
<p>希望，像一個走不盡的沙漢，像一座爬不完的高山，人，就永遠在這高山上爬，爬！爬得好的，就一段一段的爬上去，爬不好的就落到山脚下來了。有勇氣的人仍可以繼續的爬，否則就永遠躱在失望的圈套裏太息了。</p>
<p>人類，無論是誰都是有「希望」這個念頭的，卽使是最愚最蠢的人，也有他自己的希望，不過是希望的大小不同吧了。人類，又從沒有滿足的慾望過，一個希望得到了，又會再希望別種事情的，就因爲這樣，人類就常常被「希望」捲到苦悶的深淵裏去了。以前總有許多人譏笑秦始皇做了皇帝還想做神仙，想使自己長生不老，譏笑他太不知足，其實誰又不是這樣呢？有了名譽還想錢，有了錢又想漂亮的姨太太，有了姨太太又還想……，這慾望是永遠不會滿足的，除非是躲在棺材裏了。</p>
<p>同時，每一個希望，在未得到以前，心坎中總是懷着無限的熱誠　渴望的，可是，當那個希望到手以後，又會覺得乏味平常了！人，就是在這種塲合中，永遠脫不了煩悶與苦痛的！</p>
<p>就拿我自己作一個例子來說吧。小時候，看見哥哥叔叔們常常袋子裏袋滿了錢，又有許多新衣服穿，還可以任意打小孩子，我眞是羨慕得不得了，以爲自己假如是靑年人就好了。可是，當自己到長大以後，又並不覺得怎樣好了，反而留戀着兒童時代的生活了。再比方　自己在中學時代，看見別人到上海去讀大學，穿着西裝，穿着發光的皮鞋，也是羨慕得很！後來自己也有幸運到上海進大學了，但也沒有感到什麼快樂，在這個時候，又看見別人到外國去留學，自己也在發夢，以爲自己將來也有機會到外國去留學的話，那眞是「天之驕子」了。可是，現在自己眞的也在異國混日子了，而目前的生活還不是那麼寥寂那麼蠢！所以，我說，人的精力就完全竭盡在希望的進程中，直到了閉着兩眼時才停止。</p>
<p>我看見過許多朋友，當他或她過着獨身生活的時候，眞是天天希望着，連發夢也夢着，希望自己有一位愛侶來伴着過子日就好了，就幸一福了；可是當他有一天眞把愛侶找到手以後，還不是縐着眉頭凝視着灰色的長空在太息着，煩悶着！在這個時候，也就會感到戀愛也「不過如此」而已了！</p>
<p>當每一個希望到手以後，失望也就跟着來了。</p>
<p>卽如我最近，總是希望着買一個精緻的花瓶來，放在書架上，挿上一束艷花，紫丁香也好，水仙花也好，供自己課餘回來時嗅嗅那丁香的氣息，我相信總有多量的溫情從丁香的氣息裏傳到我靈魂中去的，這時候，也許會戚到無限的愉快！而現在，買了花瓶又將近十天了，而且已經換過了幾束艷花，蒲公英，紫丁香，紫雲茵都挿過，但也不見得使我怎樣愛戀，相反的，當我每次看見一片二片的殘了的花落在書架上時，更使我象徵到未來的生命了。</p>
<h3 id="c219">人與山猪 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 黑嬰</p>
<p>「山猪麼，眞是野得的怕人的傢伙啊」！說故事的人用這樣一句話結束了他的冗長約，令人厭膩的叙述。他的額紋裏滲出晶珠樣的汗點，也不去拭乾它，只搖着他那碩大的腦袋，嚧了一聲，表示現在想起來還覺得可怕的　樣。可是我却毫不在乎地走開了，一面在心裏駡着：</p>
<p>「胆怯的東西」！</p>
<p>但是讀者諸君：在這裏我應該吿訴你們，我在聽那故事的半年以後也遇見山猪了，是黑夜，又一點防備都沒有，所以差點送了一條性命。</p>
<p>那是在一個小埠頭當學徒的時候的事。父親把我送到這家洋服店裏來，像一件貨物似地，我被交到老板的乎裏：「老板，這孩子交把你了，費心敎敎他」。那樣說了以後，他便乘着原班火車回去了。照這裏的規矩，學徒是不給工資，只能用一天十小時以上的勞力換到一頓飯和塊最壞的睏覺的地方的。早晨，什麼人都沒起來以前我就得離開溫暖的夢鄕，輕手輕脚地到樓下去燒開水冲茶，洗杯干，掃地七點鐘左右，開了店門，狄計們都到齊了，我就得趕緊把燙斗的炭燒起來，不然老板就會扭了我的耳朶駡一頓的。於是我得去找老板娘，「今天買點什麼菜呢」？站在這麻臉，却有一副慈祥的心靈的婦人面前，木頭似地，等着她的吩咐。她用手摸摸臉上那些稠密的斑點，想了一刻，照例把買菜籃子遞給我，吿訴我買些什麼菜回來。這樣，我便每天非上一次菜塲不可。</p>
<p>有一次我在菜塲裏看見一頭山猪，血淋淋地被吊了起來，突向外邊的眼珠子大得怕人。一羣小孩子圍住它，指手劃脚地在說打山猪的故事——說是昨天夜裏打山猪的人出發了，一共五個人，荷着獵槍，步行到距市塲二十里左右的樹膠園背後去，結果在今天早上回來的時候，帶了這一頭回來了。</p>
<p>打山猪的人在珈琲店裏休息着。我經過那裏，住了脚聽了一會：「…危險倒也算是很…你知道它們一太羣衝了上來，我們是躲在樹上發槍的。…」</p>
<p>這一天整個的小埠頭都因了一頭山猪而震動起來。孩子們呌跳着；大人們交談着。我回憶起那次說山猪的故事的人，一面在心裏『如果我也有機會去打山猪呵！』那麼想着。</p>
<p>機會終於來了。然而這是極其偶然的。店裏的一個收賬的夥計生了病，這時剛　S圍坵裏一位荷蘭工頭的衣服賬到期了，老板急於要去收回來。他找了半天沒有法子，最後抓了我到櫃檯邊去說：荷蘭人的約是失不得的；知道麼，他等你來收，你今天不去以後他一定不肯給你了！他們是這樣的脾氣！你去一趙吧，好不好？」他做出央求的神氣，「不遠，你坐脚踏車去兩個鐘頭總可以到了。」</p>
<p>我不能不聽老板的話。並且，店裏爲那架脚踏車總是老板和收賬那夥計坐了去，我從來不曾享受到。這一次上園坵去我不是可以痛快地坐它半天嗎？這樣，在下午兩點　左右，我帶了老板給我的賬單，坐着自由車出發了。</p>
<p>路上不大遇見人，兩旁全是荒野。太陽兇猛地晒在我的頭上。偶然一輛載貨車，堆滿了椰子壳嘟嘟地駛過去，捲起一陣黃泥沙，幾乎弄得我瞧不見路走。路漸漸不平，有幾處突得高高地，似乎是一個山崗；但是當你出力爬了上去，再向下走的時後便毫不吃力了。接着又是一個高崗，又低下去……</p>
<p>到S園坵時已經全身疲乏了，大概這時四點鐘左右。我問着：『工頭約克曼在不在？』回答是上園坵去了，非等到五點鐘不能出來；沒有法子，我只好在那間白木板蓋起來的房屋門外坐着。</p>
<p>四圍靜悄悄地，沒有聲音，除了艾草的老人推着車子嚓嚓地剪齊門前的草地之外，再也看不見一個生物了。</p>
<p>在這裏我想着，五點鐘拿到了賬。再費去兩個鐘頭的路程回店裏去不是天黑了嗎？這可有點別扭呀，路上萬一遇見了什麼——璧如一頭山猪，在毫無經騐的我該怎樣躲避？那麼想了以後心頭開始顯得不安了。</p>
<p>果然在收到那筆數目並不多的賬，鼓着力量踏着脚踏車回店的半路上，天色巳由灰濛而轉成黑色了。我點着了車前那盞小小的油燈，在黃沙路上摸索着往前走。一路心卜卜地跳着。同時也在心里咒駡老板「沒有良心！明明曉得今天已經趕不及去收了還得迫人去；現在——」忽然一陣刺人神經的叫聲從左邊的荒野發出來，對過的曠野像萎縮了似地躲得遠遠地，一片水　伸展着。接着我聽見一陣笨重的脚步聲往前衝上來，還有彷彿發了狂的猪的叫喊。我全身抖悸着，兩邊不能往前走了，心上一急便跳下車，隨時那兇猛的畜牲巳經迫近我的身邊，我沒有法子只好跳到水潭里去。好在水的深度只及我的大腿；站在那里看着一頭比以前吊在菜塲的山猪還要大兩倍的傢伙走過去了，心像被石頭擲了過來那樣地窒息了一下，才回復轉來，找到脚車飛奔地逃回來。</p>
<p>第二天我辭了洋服店的學徒職務，由於老板的好意給了我兩塊錢買了三等車票回家去。我見到父親，便把險　被山豬喫了的經過對他說了一遍；他却出乎意外地對我說：「孩子，吿訴你吧：要生活就非冒生死之險不可；你以爲沒有山猪就不再有危險麼？你錯了。人有時也會吃人的呀！」</p>
<p>所以，第三天，我又被送回那家洋服店去了。</p>

<p>『爸爸回來了就一定會變成有錢的人吧；那時，我們再也不會給稱做吃剩飯的，日子也將要好過起來吧……』——我的這種期望，完全落了個空。</p>
<p>當我是個二年級生的時候，姐姐已經是個四年級生了。因爲姐姐是個女人，所以比我更能够詳細地留意到家裏的生活情况；她就由自己和母親商量，退了學，當了烟草專賣局的女工。</p>
<p>僞稱不合格的十三歲的年齡爲十五歲，爲着拿一天一角六分的工錢，姐姐早上五點　就起身，忽怱忙忙地跑到離家一里路遠的專賣局裏去。</p>
<p>姐姐的年齡雖小，却很老成；但，身量則跟我同樣地細小。脇窩裏夾着包飯盒的髒乎巾，在黃昏時分跑回家裏來的姐姐，是很忽忙的。爲着有一角六分錢的工資好領，姐姐眞是忽忙得可以。</p>
<p>一因爲義務敎育已經延長到六年，所以一定要上學去。」雖是也有過村長和校長的督促；但，母親却不睬。姐姐也簡直不理。</p>

<p>第二年，我考第三名進了三年級。在小學校的學生中間也互相談論着敎員受了兒童保護者的賄賂，把發表的成績故意弄得高低的事情。</p>
<p>可是，那樣的事情，我却一點也不介意。也曾有同級生來桃唆我，說是當級長的上野學力還趕不上我，問我覺得怎樣；但，在我，那樣的事情是無論怎樣也可以的。反正自己是不能够進中學的，四年畢業之後就非趕忙跑到什麼地方的工塲裏去　錢不可——對於這樣地想着的我，那種事情是完全不肯過問的。</p>
<p>那一年，母親又生了小寳寳。我們兄妹已經是五個人了。爲着看顧那初生的男小孩，我不到學校裏去的日子也就比從前更多了。動不動就一個整禮拜都不去上課。</p>
<p>雖然如此，但我並不是不高興到學校裏去的。我喜歡背負着頂小的弟弟，站在後門近旁，看各種書籍。無論是國語的敎科書，演義的出和書，或是舊的婦女雜誌等等，我都時常用光看字母的方法閱　着。而且我很擅長用漢音去讀漢字。演義等等，都注着好幾種的音　，當附近的人們來聽的時候，我就把岩見重太郞的殺大蛇，八尤傳，寬永三馬術等等得意地讀起來。</p>

<h3 id="c222">別字問題 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 巴山</p>
<p>這幾年來，關於別字問題，在文壇上鬧得不亦樂乎，</p>
<p>先有劉半農先生的打油詩，嘲弄投考學生的「倡明」「流學生，」後有曹聚、仁先生的提倡別字，還有魯迅先生對別字應用問題的曲辯．早已經令人十分注意的了，最近「手頭字」有人合羣地在推行，對於別字有意地在提倡起來，這就成了作文用字的重大問題了。</p>
<p>原來古人是曾經用過別字的，那就是所謂「通借」的方法。漢人六書中百「假借」一類，亦卽是應用別字的一種解說。而因為各地方言的不向，現在的人、亦實在還在應用書別字呢。地方「蠻好」一詞，有的地方呌「滿好；」因此在文藝書上亦有人寫「蠻好，」亦有人寫「滿好，」而其實「蠻」與「滿」都對，并不是別字、；但於講「滿好」的方言地方的人，對於「蠻好」這一詞，便看成別字的了。為了剷除文盲，便於識字起見，各地以當地方言教人識字，就是應用別字亦是對的。因為雖然那是別字，但是文盲由音識字那是容易懂得多了。然而，我雖然贊成應用別字，却只是如上述所說，教文盲識字的時候應用別字是對的；可是如果要我們已經識了不少字的人，現在亦來認識別字，那是未敢赞同的了。</p>
<p>「手頭字」第一期字彙，應用別字也就不少了，甚至於有的「手頭字」并不是通俗的別字，連我們已經識了不少字的人亦不認識，這樣的「推行」下去，將來各雜志各書籍應用起來，恐怕連我們已經識了不少字的人亦將變成了文盲了。這是未敢贊同的一個大原因與大理由。其中如「窮」字寫成「穷」，「懊」字寫成「　」，「讓」字寫成「　」，「腰」字寫成「　」，「塊」字寫成「块」，等等，都是我們不識的。又如「從」字寫成「从」「叢」字亦寫成「从」、已經一字兩用使人無從分別了，而且「麼」字寫成「　」與原本有的正字「　　相同、亦覺得不大妥當。</p>
<p>據說各雜志發表「手頭字」第一期字彙已經好久，而沒有將雜誌印成「手頭字」的緣故，就是要先使人認識「手頭字；」而且又聽說到了南三個月以後大家都認識了「手頭字」各雜志就要印成「手頭字」的了。這樣一來，即是說要我們已經認識了不少字的人在這兩三個月內變成了文盲，應該就那「欽定」的字彙如開蒙的小學生似地認字起來了。</p>
<p>為了普及教育與促進文化起見，本來大家吃點苦頭是應該的；可是像「手頭字」裹頭所用的非通俗字亦要大家吃苦頭去認，我們總覺得這是不大合理的。「手頭字」的「推行，」是一種「删繁就簡」，「捨難就易」的「中庸之道，」既然是不徹底的工作還要大家吃苦頭，在我是情願認識拉丁化文字來一個徹底的文字改革的了。</p>
<h3 id="c223">壼裏乾坤大 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 二郎</p>
<p>在寫字間那裹，阿根本來就想要冒火了，出來走到廠門口，逢著那個拿馬溫，望了他一眼冷笑着，他更加忍受不住。「×你娘」！呌着就要镤上去凑他一頓，他却一溜，溜進廠裹去了。隔壁阿大走到，懷着奇怪的眼光望着他，間道，「啥事體」？阿根碰到了熟人不禁一股心酸，想要流淚，可是他忍住：流眼淚不是有種的漠子。低着頭無精打采地答他，「歇生意」。阿大驚異得兩隻眼睛白洋洋，又問道，「啥事體」？他哼了一聲「那個拿馬温猪玀」，說亦說不清，憤怒之火燒得他頭腦發昏了。阿大馬上記起昨天的事來。</p>
<p>昨天，阿根合阿太在電氣間裏頭工作，阿祖時常嘆氣，阿大問他「啥事體」？（阿大的「啥事體」），是差不多成了他的口頭禪的，可是在他的環境亦就有許多事發生到，使他的「啥事體」的口頭禪沒法不用）。他若是房東老是迫房租，而上月因為生病工鈿差不多扣完了!阿大同情着。兩人由憤恨而咒罵廠裏起來。阿大是曾經吃過苦頭的，說話並不怎樣激烈。阿根那就不管天高地厚，什麼人都駡，什麼話都說。不提防拿馬溫巡到電氣間那裏，而阿根恰恰是在咒駡著拿馬温那猪玀的。拿馬溫兇着臉迫近他的身體，問道，「儂駡啥人？×你娘」順手就給他吃一個耳光。阿根是最看不起那猪玀的，你打我，好，伸手便凑他一下。那猪玀雖然身穿西裝，看去好像怪有尚武的精神，可是銀樣蠟搶頭，完全吃不消，給阿根輕輕一凑，跌倒到煤炭堆裏去了。呻吟着，不敢回口，狼狽地逃出了電氣間。…</p>
<p>歇生意，有什麼法子想？阿大雖然同情卻亦沒話可說，何况他亦有嫌疑呢？安慰阿根一番進廠上工去了。阿根提了遲鈍沉重的脚，在馬路上亂跑，走過小酒店門口，裏頭賣唱的小姑娘合着硬綁綁的胡琴，在唱着「十不該」，他下了决心，將身上的銅板吃酒去，於是乎進了酒店坐下，右脚跷起望登凳頭上一擱，呌堂倌兒來四兩白乾，那璧上的對手，寫着「壼裏乾坤大，樽中日月長」，他暍了酒，亦成了酒仙了。</p>
<p>門口閃過一個婦人，手裏抱着一個在啃大饼的小孩，衣裾邊拖着一個五六歲的髒孩子，望了阿根一眼，回轉身踱進酒店來、。阿根並不提防，給她一抓嚇了一跳。那婦人道，「儂啥事體勿去上工？倒會氽到此地來格，死儂隻格酒鬼」！阿根並不開口，　　喝他的白乾。那婦人更兇起來　　　　　「死酒鬼，今天勿去上工，二房東討了趟房鈿儂也勿是勿曉得格，呌我女人擋頭陣，儂也就連法子也覅想格？喝儂格斷命酒，屋裏夜販米拉啥地方？大哭小喊儂就才勿管了？……」</p>
<p>阿根很想乘氣凑他家主婆一頓，看見大的小的那兩個小鬼頭在旁邊，想着從此歇生意，一家人不知如何是好，吃西北風去？越想越愁，那婦人的毒駡聲並不吹進他的耳朶裏。……</p>
<h3 id="c224">尼姑 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 拓人</p>
<p>瀰蔓着山坡的翠竹，一片綠油油地好似是玉砌成樣的，在那玉色的竹林中，隱約地微露出一點紅色的屋尖。在日裹，春風吹拂着嫩綠的竹葉在響，木魚的聲，也會沉沉地隨着春風吹送進路上旅人的耳中。當在夕陽西下的時候，那聽去好似山野間的弧寂地人的歌聲般底寺鐘，聲音是那末陰沉沉地悽凉。這是靜穆地尼庵，它是永遠的在這翠綠的竹林裹，度過着冷落的歲月。</p>
<p>到了春天，我就會想起了那在南國的溫風裹的風光。尤其是使我想起了那靜穆的「翠竹庵」。　　　　．</p>
<p>是五年前了吧!我是終日的徘徊在那翠綠的竹林間。我當時會感到人生的虛渺，對於社會環境也是感到了厭惡。我在想，我也願意離開了现實的人生，而隱住於靜穆地山林間，去追求着幻境的甜蜜，安靜的迷夢。但畢竟我是沒有把夢做成了。還是在這現實的社會裹，走上着人生的旅途，流浪的生活着。到現在，算起來已經是五年之久了。在這五年中，哉沒有幸運的再去玩賞那靜穆的勝地，對於它，只有在幻想中，溫着了快樂的舊夢。</p>
<p>我想起了「翠竹庵」，我就會想起了那做尼姑的静。</p>
<p>静，一個年青的尼姑。她的青春的嫩臉上，現着微淡的蒼黄，她那清秀的濃眉和碧眼，是現出着沉思的愁色。她的身段，她整個的輪廓，是顯現出牠是一個秀麗沉靜的女人。她常常是用緘默來回答他人的問話，她也常常用着微笑來遮住她的憂愁。在庵中，她是一個為人所愛的人，但她却從來就沒對誰表示了好感。</p>
<p>她的身世，是很少的人能够知道的。雖然在外表上看，她一定是一個高貴的小姐，而且是有學問的。但到底她為什麼做尼姑？那是誰也猜不透的。</p>
<p>在五年前的一個春天之午後，我到了「翠竹庵」去玩，在無意中，我注意着她。我會　注意她，那也是很偶然地。常我走到庵後想跑到竹林裏去的當兒，我發現了她。那時她獨自一個坐在那古井的石沼土上，當下我成感到很奇怪：覺得那尼姑一定是有什麼來歷的。就從那一天起，她在我的腦子裏的印象，一日一日的强調起來了。</p>
<p>漸漸地，我也合她認識了。我的好奇心重，所以時時間起她的身世，可是她給我的回答是緘默。似乎一切的話，</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>都盡在那不言之中，經過幾次的失望，我也就不再提起了。</p>
<p>幾個月之後，我回家去了。在回家後不到幾天，那時已是炎夏了。在早晨的陽光中，我接到她給我的一封很長的信，在那信中有一段是這樣寫着：</p>
<p>「……或許你會發惱，為什麼我不告訴你我的身仳？其實，你假如是因這一點而生氣，那你未免是一個太無智識的人了。你是知道的，在這個社會中，一個女人是很容易給人毀滅地。我之做尼姑，也是這個社會迫我，我的不把我的身世告人，也是為了保有我不致完全的被毀滅滅才緘默。……我不信神　，但我要做尼姑，我已經可死了，人生我已感到無味，但我還要活着，這是我的矛盾，也可說是社會的矛盾。我也明白做尼姑也無好果，人可以受毀滅，尼姑也一樣會受到毒滅的一天的。……」</p>
<p>收到信之後，我才明白了她也是一個社會惡勢力下的弱者，將來總會給犧牲了的。</p>
<p>時間過得快，自從接到這封信之後，現在已是五年了，音信是兩相杳然，我是流浪在異地五年，而她是否　存在這個弱者不能生存的社會中？</p>
<h3 id="c225">小王那傢伙 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— 小綺</p>
<p>小王那傢伙有使長長的而又是徧的腦瓜子，　骨高高地朝天翹上，嘴巴子刧是尖實的，皮膚色像蓋馬路的柏油那麼黑而且發光，兩隻眼珠閃溜溜地射着一鼓兒蠻動，身子是挺結實的，跑怎麼遠的路全不當成回事。那付模樣兒就和流浪在街頭攢垃圾箱拾烟屑的大野孩子沒點分別。</p>
<p>那渾小子難道有什麼出息不，成，小王雖說是我的同鄉，但我老是那麼瞧他不上眼，尤其是當他說話的時候，一付尷尬相便越活現出來，更呌人覺得可厭又可笑。</p>
<p>小王頂欲嚼嚼舌根子，一夥兒子在談閒天，不管談哪樣子，準有他的份兒，當人家扯上娘兒們身上的當兒，小王便格外有勁，朝外長的門牙笑個露了顯現，一邊結巴結巴的胡說着：</p>
<p>—嘿，你們成天儘管愛呀情的，見了女人骨頭便發酥，異是…咱可從來看輕這個，那些小娘子，稀罕什麼，送給老子，老子還要想想的，有銅鈿合怎麼俏娘子都吊得上來，哼，稀罕個屁，是不是？</p>
<p>—嗤，小王，別說漂亮話，先照照鏡子吧，沒有你不要。</p>
<p>有人帶着譏嘲腔子刺着小王，小王並不臉紅，他知道他自己一付醜得可以的臉孔，但他可不曾怨過養他的爹娘，也沒會在這個鬧過蹩扭，人家用迄來侃調他的時候。小王倒反而得意起來；</p>
<p>—哼，話不是那麼來路，老子用不着把臭小白臉孔兒去呌娘子們歡喜，老子的尷尬相徧呌娘子們不能不討好，那才怪呢？」</p>
<p>—鬼相信，鬼相你小王的亂吹牛皮。</p>
<p>—嗄！小王你賭個咒兒吧；說我小王不吹牛，天雷劈頂。</p>
<p>於是接着小王便背故事似的哇拉哇拉說什麼時候那個娘兒請他吃飯啦！什麼時候這個娘兒送錢給他花啦！一年到底，憑記得住至少便揩過一打以上的女人的油。</p>
<p>—吹牛吹牛。小王先把臉孔照照鏡子吧。</p>
<p>小王所拉扯的究竟有沒撒謊。那可別管。</p>
<p>小王鎭日里沒一宗正經話到做，儘是朝外邊溜腿子，吊兒哴噹地一天混過一天，可是他亦穿一套不怎樣破落的咖啡呢西裝，黑色皮鞋，領帶子打得挺直的。也抽着烟，也時不時看電影，也上館子。他自家兒從沒有過一定的寮子，脚踏到那兒便是那兒，吃的住的，那兒全有他的。小王究竟幹那一行的，他的日子怎樣過法，誰也弄不淸，於是你問着他。</p>
<p>—小王，你不做活，日子過得？</p>
<p>—才怪呢，咱雖不做活，日子刧也過得寫寫意意哩。</p>
<p>小王笑個饗，驕傲表明在他的笑里。</p>
<p>給他那麼一說你眞會幾分暗暗覺得小王那傢伙多够木事，輕個子，一點活計沒得，倒也如人家一樣安閑地過日子，而且來得更神氣，打哪兒來的一手兒呢。這光有小王自家曉得。</p>
<p>小王到底幹那一行呢，連我都摸不着頭腦，同時亦沒想頸追向他，因為有時偶然觸到這個，每次他總是夾七雜八好像不肯實告似地。有時我看見他嘴角上沒咬烟蒂兒—烟在他跟米糧一樣短少不得。心里就明白小王窮得露頭骨兒了。可是他一向不曾開過口跟我要過半個銅子。最多是吃你一頓飯。</p>
<p>小王有的是天大的膽兒，兩條粗勁腿子，一隻鐵鎚似的拳頭，給人揍一把他全不在乎，若讓他凑你一下子可準直痛上背窩心。呌小王做打手是凖沒錯兒的。</p>
<p>可是好久不見小王了，我正在奇怪，恰好有一天在街上無意跟一個常常合小王在一塊的人碰頭，他告訴我：小王給抓去幾天了。</p>
<p>「那麼事」，我驚異着問。</p>
<p>「那只有小王自己曉得。」</p>
<h3 id="c226">抬驢子的故事 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>做人亦大難矣！</p>
<p>糊塗不成：認眞也不對。</p>
<p>潔身自好，這是個人主義；隨波逐浪，那又是同流合汚。</p>
<p>窮，會給人家看不起；富，也要呌人嫉視。</p>
<p>得過且過吧，人要說你醉生夢死；奮發進取嗎，他們又會譏你向上爬。</p>
<p>革命是激烈份子；不革命是冷血動物。</p>
<p>拖辮子紮小脚，當然要給人笑為落伍；戴高帽子着高跑鞋呢，還免不了會被人罵一聲趨時。</p>
<p>總之，是樣樣都不滿人意！</p>
<p>印度有一椿故事，說：從前有一個老翁和一個孩子，用一匹驢子馱着貨物去出賣。貨物賣完了，孩子騎着驢子同來，老翁就跟着走，但路人責備他了，說是孩子不曉事，呌老年人徒步。他們便換了一個地位了，老翁騎着驢子，孩子跟後面跑。但旁人又說老人忍心了。老翁忙把孩子抱到鞍轎上。後來看見的人，都說他們殘酷，兩個人騎着一匹驢子。於是老翁和孩子都下來了。走了不久，可是又有人笑他們了，說他們是獃子，空着現成的　子都不騎。這時老翁就對孩子歎息道，我們這樣也不成，那樣也不對，我們現在只剩了一個辦法了，是我們兩個人抬着這匹驢子走。</p>
<p>我想；做人之難，有時也要難到抬驢子走的地步！</p>

<h3 id="c232">埃迪康泰之妻愛達康泰的滑稽聲明 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 金雀</p>
<p>愛達康泰（Lda　Cantor），「恭喜發財」中主角埃迪康緊之妻，跳了起來道：「這眞使人厭煩死了。將來再要有人問我這種話的時候，我要怪呌起來了！」</p>
<p>原來大家看見了這位滑稽名家之妻，都要問她一聲：「他在家的時候，是和在銀幕上一樣滑稽的嗎？」愛達很生氣地說道：「譬如你的男子是ｇ　個瓦匠，或是一個砌烟囟的，或是一個騎馬師，人家看見了你，常常問你，他在家裏常常砌牆嗎，他會油漆旗桿嗎，或是他會在客堂騎馬嗎，你將覺得怎樣？</p>
<p>「哦，你不喜歡？我亦不喜歡的。我嫁的丈夫，是一個眞實的男子，齊巧是一僩喜劇家，並不是我嫁了一位喜劇家，他齊巧是個男子。」愛達的聲明，已經够滑稽的滋味了。</p>
<p>但是愛達刧又承認，他的丈主夫在家的時候，有時確是很滑精的，但那並不是無味的滑稽，而是故意做出來送我們笑的。記得有一次，她的丈夫從外面回來。他告訴她，說是倦極了，要去睡一回。愛達和她五位小姐於是都大家嘿然不饗，好讓她們的父親安睡一回。埃迪於是就上樓去睡了。過了一回，愛達和她五個女兒，忽然聽見樓梯上有人走路的聲音。她們回頭一看，祇見埃迪閉着雙眼，手伸着放在前面，話像一個睡中走路的樣子，口中還念念有詞的道：「家裏太安靜了。我是在睡中行路哩。誰來作些嚮聲驚醒我吧。」他頭上戴着禮情，身上穿着浴衣。這使她們都驚駭莫名起來。</p>
<p>愛達道：「不差的，他在家裏的時候，亦常常扮着丑角的，當我們有些吵嘴不痛快的時候。這種小事是任何最好的家庭，都不能避免的，但是給埃迪知道了，他就要尋開心，區我們笑，使我們大家都歡樂了為止。在埃迪心目之中，家庭就是他宇宙的中心。他的所以能在銀幕上滑稽，就是因為他在家中快樂的原故」。</p>
<p>愛迪於是又講她未嫁給這位滑稽主角的前的事道：「我認識他已經很久了。我認識他的時候，他還穿着短袴子哩。那個短袴，並不是打高爾夫穿的短袴。那個時候，一班小孩子在地道的變梯底下玩要的時候，誰要提起高爾夫，我們一定要似為他吃蘿獲吃得太多了。那個時候，我們同在亨利街的小學裏上學。我那個時侯，就很佩服他的聰明滑稽，因此我們二人，就特別的要好。他常常和我一同進出，替我拿書包。他到現在還常常說：「那時我替你拿課本，現在你刧替我拿銀行本子了」。</p>
<p>原來埃迪康泰從前會經一度做過裁縫的。這亦是他的太太講出來的。他的作裁縫，並且是為了她的原故。因為在埃迪登了舞臺，扮演丑角之後，他們二人就開始談論起婚姻。但是愛達的家庭，反對她嫁一個舞臺的丑角。因此，埃迪就放棄了他天才所指示的途徑，而脫離子舞臺生涯。他尋着其他許多工作，而在一家衣服公司做裁衣師，亦是其中之一。但是他不久，就被掌櫃停了生意，因為他將好好的衣料，不知不覺的剪成了許多跳舞的小人兒。</p>
<p>從此以後，他又做了許多別的工作。整整的有一年之久，他痛改前非，要想做一個平常人常，將他血脈中生來即有的歌心舞心，一齊淸除，但是無論如何，最後還是不成功。「是是我就讓步了」，愛達康泰說。「雖然他還堅持着要做一個「正人君子」，好使我的家屬對他滿意，但是我刧知道他不能和他的天才，和他的心志，背道而馳。因此我决定了呌他重新回到舞臺上去。我亦决心無論我家屬的意見如何，嫁給他。所以我的嫁給他並不是因為他是一個喜劇家，而是因為他是我惟一崇拜的人，不管他是不是喜劇家也。直到現在，我的决定刧已得到了無已的報酬了」。</p>

<h3 id="c233">「評金蓮劫」 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 華倫</p>
<p>Have　A　Heart——南京映</p>
<p>文學上以描寫生理缺憾與身體殘廢之悲喜劇成功的很多，這除了相當於心理變態的人之富於可描寫的過程與現象之外，，還有着常事人因某些缺憾演成極深切的內心的悲哀，寫來更為容易動人的？</p>
<p>「金蓮刦」這　劇本，正如譯名所示，是寫一位小姐因着脚的不幸遭遇，演出的悲劇。作者以女主角莎萊的敎授跳舞，反面地在觀眾的腦海中種下了對於她那綺麗多姿，嬌健活潑的印象，接著再用新婚前夜的狂歡大樂，來把戲劇的快樂空氣維持到了一個相當高的程度上。於是急轉直下地由於歡樂中的失足，跌成了脚的殘疾，把劇情折入正面，更以那個未婚夫因為她的不幸遭受而不愛她，這一轉變，藉此博得觀眾對她的同情，來維持瑣細地描寫她此後生活的情緒。</p>
<p>劇情展開在莎萊和一個糖果冰淇淋公司的賣貨員吉姆的懋愛生活上，把她怎樣設法掩蓋自己的缺憾，怎樣偏偏被他發見，以及相反地吉姆竟因她遭受了這遺憾而格外　愛她，這些來作戲的跌宕與曲折。其實，到這兒為止，劇作者若是能設法就此結束的話，倒還不失為一個良好的劇本。然而，他竟拉了個偶然的機會，全沒有必要地把劇情拖到偵探案子中去，以吉姆被寃做賊而入獄，因莎萊用錢贖他出來，反而憤然出走來做這些簡直多餘的戲。作者也恐怕這樣的下去有些使觀眾不耐煩，於是他用賽馬，捉眞賊這些劇烈的動作來作為刺激。然後讓吉姆，跑到脚疾雖然己經治好，可是心灰意懶的莎萊身邊去，重燃起愛的火燄，完成了大團圓的結尾。</p>
<p>這樣的劇情，固然獲得了所謂曲折，但同時也就不免成為平庸的調子。</p>
<p>導演David　Butler處理這片子刧是相當可取的。起始時只幾個簡潔的畫面，把莎萊的生活與性格寫得非常生動與深刻。新婚前夜的空氣設置也頗為充足。在莎萊與醫生的對話與表情中，製作玩具偶像時對於牠的脚的特別注意，吉姆突然來訪對於病脚欲掩藏而不能時的悲楚。只是簡短的幾個鏡頭，把一個懷著身體上缺憾的少女的心情，寫得極好。次之如小孩與狗的在劇中出現也極恰當與有效。前者在開始時寫莎萊敎大羣的小孩舞蹈，與情夫佐義出門時被成羣的孩子圍着歡呼嬉笑。在她有了殘疾坐在窗前將要認識第二個情人吉姆前，又是成羣的街頭孩子圍着吉姆買糖，跟着他唱歌，這作着前後有力的照應。後者這條小狗的幾次出現，都作為女主角悲苦中的伴侶，與回憶或關接中的重要東西。</p>
<p>從「小婦人」中露頭角到這「金蓮刦」主演的瓊派克，這兒有着極可人的成績。她那俏瘦的面部輸你與體態，以及把身體有着缺憾，以致對於身世有難言之痛的少女心情，演來分外動人。演吉姆的吉姆士鄧之獷悍，演她的知友瓊的尤娜茂凱爾的有點　直，以及她的多愁善感，都恰如其分而作了對照的描寫。</p>
<h3 id="c234">評「妻的情人」 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— 繼漢</p>
<p>Hat　Coat　Clove</p>
<p>—大上海映—</p>
<p>將「帽子，大衣，乎套」的題名改譯為「妻的情人」，這不僅是在營業號召上有着誘惑的作用，而且對於作為劇的主要部份的丈夫的悲哀，也在題目上說明了。是的，「妻的情人」假使能使有家室的人們為之感動的話，便是律師羅伯脫發現了夫人有了外遇而又不能不顧全夫妻間之體面的一點上。這種地方，資本主義的作家們，在文學上，在戲劇上，他們都是常將其作為情感與理性之矛盾而描寫善的。</p>
<p>據說這一影片是由舞台劇改編的。假使原劇是五幕劇的話，那末便是第一幕為夫婦二人和妻的情人在商唐中購帽子，大衣，手套等物，第二幕是丈夫在妻處晚餐，聽見妻和情人通電話，第三幕，妻的情人——少年畫家在妻處穿了丈夫的舊大衣去，第四幕是靑年畫家離開他的模特兒以及模特兒悮死的經過，而第五幕該是法庭中了。</p>
<p>當然，我並沒有看過原劇本，這不過是就電影上所看到的加以臆斷。不過，我的臆斷假使並不十分錯的話，那末電影的「妻的情人」之舞台劇的舊迹，是很容易尋找出來的了。大家都知道，電影的優越性，便是不受時間與空間的限制。但是名杜巴利的女人在法庭上突然作證，正是舞台劇原般的運用，因為在舞台劇上杜巴利的家不能單獨作為一幕，而電影上刧大可以不必如此。他如對話的繁重，也是太愛惜了原劇的地方，那末多的對話，在電影上無論如何是使人厭煩的了。再要說到的便是所謂「無巧不成戲」，差不多這裏全以巧合組織起來的。因此人們不能不感覺到這是做戲，世界上决不會眞有如此巧合的事實。</p>
<p>劇中除着寫了一些所謂丈夫失子妻的愛情的悲哀之外，差不多無甚可取。而在資本主義的社會中，夫妻之間的愛的糾紛，又是何等平凡啊！但是美國雷影刧常在這方而感覺極大的興趣。更平庸的這裏和通常的悲喜劇一樣，不會例外的要來一個破鏡重圓。</p>
<p>法庭的一塲，和畫家的模特兒悮死的一塲，都可以看出導演很賣力。模特兒失戀後瘋狂的變熊，對照着律師的同病相憐，固然發揮了劇的情感，而法庭中的種種，並不滯澀或沉悶，更是難能可貴之處。特別是由於杜巴利可笑的忸怩風姿作為有趣的穿揷，更能使空氣活潑生動。至於原告律師的巧辯，對照着被告律師將一切證物都加以反證，這暗示了我們資本社會的法律眞是太兒戲了，雖然作者的原意並不如此。但是李卡圖加脫（Ricarco　Cortez）傷感的演技，刧使這一部平凡的電影作品為之生色不少。</p>

<p>— 懋德</p>
<p>不久他們又生了一個兒子。他們覺得生活的滿足，可以算是無以復加了。小克萊夫的體質，雖然是脆弱的很，但是英王部派了太醫，弗立斯動時，來診治這個小孩，因此他們覺得他不久一定會長大强健的，而想劇和憂慮决不會降臨在他們身上的。</p>
<p>克萊夫雖是一介武夫，但是好動好鬥的天性，是不宜於安居的。因此，他不久又想在本國的官塲中，佔得一個高崇的席位。武人於戎馬之餘，往往喜歡涉獲於文治，克萊夫亦逃不出這個慣例。他於是就加入了國會議員的選舉競爭。他在這競選之中，抓霍了鉅萬的家財，想在國會中佔得一席地。他覺得一旦能躋身於議士林，為國，為家，為個人，都可以些為人的天職。</p>
<p>但是在這個時候，印度的擾亂又發生了。印度的新君，薩拉烏特都拉，和法國人勾結了，又想將英國的商人驅出印度境外了。在這個時候，印度的英國商人又想到了一個人，一個轉敗為勝，以少克多的戰士。但是怎樣能得到他的帮助呢？東印度貿易公司的董事部，這時正在倫敦開著重要會議。主席蘇烈文說道：一但是他現在已經富有了，那裏還肯幹那種事呢？再則他新近國會競選，已有相當的勝利。他還有嬌妻幼子。我們怎能將他騙出來，叫他回到印度去呢？」</p>
<p>其中一位足智多謀的莊期東刧說道：「騙他出來，當然是不興的，但是我們可以施展一個計策，使他自已情願出來。他又不是什麼富有之家，但舉止豪華，不啻一位王公貴族，在選舉之中，家財已經被他揮霍得差不多了。我們祗要抓到些技衛點上的小毛病，使他踏不進國會的大鬥，那他不是就白白仆了許多錢了嗎？到了那個時候，我們　向他提出條件來，他非但不得不接受，反要感激我們了。」</p>
<p>悲慘和慮，果竟降臨了皇后度塲上克萊夫的家中。那幾乎是瑪格勒蒂克來來夫所不能祖當，也是任同女子所担當不起的悲慘。弗立斯勳爵有一天告訴了她，說她的兒子已經沒有生望了。那或者要到幾個月之後但是那是人力所不能挽救的。結果是，定不可避免的，不過時日的問題而已。她聽了太醫的話，正在悲切之中，克萊夫剛從外面同來。他說他在國會中爭得的位置，已經被別人搶去了。他坐在他常坐的椅子之中，兩隻手捧住了他的頭，頭上的筋暴漲著。他頭的舊創，每逢不如竟事的時候，總是要發作起來的。</p>
<p>瑪格勒蒂站在他的身後，徐徐的替他撫摩著他的頭，時時向他頭上灑著清凉的藥水。她悲慘萬份的思量著，那太醫的話，怎能再讓地知道呢？但是她一僩人能够担當得起，這重重的　慾嗎？</p>
<p>過了一回，克萊夫覺得安靜些，他說道：「瑪格勒蒂，你的一雙手眞奇怪。我想如果我沒有你，世上還有什麼樂趣呢？」過了一回，他又說道：「瑪格勒蒂，我們的家刧毀了！」瑪格勒蒂在他身旁的小矮凳上坐了下來說道：「不差的，我知道。但是從今以後，我們可以多有你在家，因為……」（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Raging Yellow River Waters – Changyuan River Works Increasingly Precarious – Guantai Opening Scoured to a Depth of Thirty-One Feet – Top of Taihang Dike Only Two to Three Feet Above Water <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Changyuan County Magistrate Zhang Qinglu and Provincial Government Committee Member Ye Zhenmin telegraphed the province, stating that the Yellow River water is pressing urgently, with violent winds and waves, raging and surging. The Guantai opening has changed, scoured to a depth of thirty-one feet, making the situation extremely dangerous. The Taihang Dike water level has risen one and a half feet, leaving only two to three feet to the top of the dike. The Wu Dike and Sun Dong locations have suffered multiple collapses. Local villagers are desperately trying to block the breaches, but labor and materials are lacking. They request urgent allocation of resources; otherwise, the river will change course and the dike will collapse, and northern Hebei will lose its barrier. The provincial government has scheduled an emergency meeting for 9:00 AM on the 23rd to discuss breach-blocking strategies. Kong Xiangrong arrived at the Guantai opening on the 21st to inspect, met with Hu Yuanhui, and discussed breach-blocking methods. The new Hebei River Affairs Bureau Director Qi Shouan arrived on the 21st to take office. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The River Affairs Bureau has begun spring dike maintenance projects. Because the Guantai opening has not been blocked, water flows eastward along the Jin Dike. The Shouzhang city protection dike is already leaking water, and water pumps are currently being used to pump water outwards. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Statement by a Leading Member of the Economic Commission – Yellow River Breach-Blocking Project – Blocking the Guantai Breach is Certainly Necessary – Reinforcing the Jin Dike is Even More Urgent <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A leading member of the Economic Commission spoke about methods to block the Yellow River breaches. Investigation reveals that the Guantai breach-blocking project was originally handled by the Hebei Provincial River Affairs Bureau. Last winter, the water flow was shallow and slow, making blocking and construction convenient, so it could have been closed early. However, due to insufficient materials, the opportunity was missed. In late February and early March of this year, it was reported that the Yellow River water level was rising rapidly, making the Guantai breach-blocking project urgent. Therefore, three emergency rescue measures were promptly organized: (1) Instruct Kong Xiangrong of the Work Relief Group to quickly convene the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, the heads of the Hebei, Shandong, and Henan Construction Bureaus, and the River Affairs Bureau to discuss remedial measures. (2) Consult with the Army Survey Bureau of the General Staff Department to dispatch aircraft for aerial surveying, with the aim of clearly understanding the situation of the breached and flooded areas for research purposes. (3) Send Committee Member Chuan Rulin to conduct on-site inspections and work with various agencies to jointly formulate action plans. Subsequently, various reports, aerial survey maps, and suggestions from League of Nations water conservancy experts were compiled, and based on scientific principles, the advantages and disadvantages were carefully considered and thoroughly researched, leading to a conclusion. As the water level is becoming increasingly urgent, blocking the Guantai breach is certainly necessary. However, reinforcing the Jin Dike is vital to the safety of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces, and is even more crucial to the overall situation, allowing no delay. Regarding the Guantai breach-blocking project, many good opportunities have been missed in the past due to unclear responsibilities. In the future, the responsible personnel should be identified and unified command established to attempt rescue. Based on this conclusion, it was decided that the Guantai breach-blocking and Jin Dike reinforcement should be carried out simultaneously. The breach-blocking affairs were assigned to the Work Relief Group to manage, with the establishment of an Engineering Office headed by the Director of the Hebei River Affairs Bureau, who is responsible for blocking and construction under the direction of Director Kong. The dike reinforcement affairs were assigned to the Yellow River Conservancy Commission to manage, with the goal of completing the reinforcement of the Jin Dike before the major flood season. Both were granted the authority to command the Construction Bureau of the provincial governments and the county governments in their respective locations to facilitate progress. These measures have been telegraphed to be followed and have been forwarded to the Executive Yuan to be passed on to the governments of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces for compliance. Furthermore, Fu Rulin is still dispatched to represent the Commission for close supervision of the breach-blocking and dike repair. Currently, Kong Xiangrong and Li Yishe have telegraphed back, complying with the order to prepare. The Ministry of Finance has also prepared the needed one million yuan for the breach-blocking and dike repair, and half has already been allocated. In recent days, the water level has not decreased, and the Guantai breach-blocking project is difficult to be optimistic about. Reinforcing the dikes is extremely important. In addition to ordering Li Yishe to quickly reinforce the Jin Dike, telegrams have been sent to the governments of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces, requesting early planning for flood prevention and dike repairs within their jurisdictions, and consultation with the Yellow River Commission. The Commission is extremely concerned about the Yellow River water conservancy emergency. As the major flood season is approaching, there is increasing cause for concern. It is currently supervising the responsible agencies and devising various remedial measures. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>

(22nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan's Higher Law and Finance Committees held a joint meeting on the 22nd to review the amendment of the Exchange Law. The results were as follows: (1) Add to the end of Article 31: "The proportion of the deposit paid by both the buyer and seller, the amount and the ratio of the registered trading price are specified as follows: A. Goods shall not be less than 10 percent; B. Cotton yarn shall not be less than 5 percent; C. Securities shall not be less than 8 percent; D. Gold industry shall not be less than 5 percent." (2) Add a term to Article 42, namely, "Third item supervisors shall investigate the exchange situation at any time." (3) Add "Article 46 Violations of the provisions of Article 31 shall be punished one to ten times more severely." (4) All references to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in the articles are corrected to the Ministry of Industry. Subsequently, the preliminary review case was discussed, with three additional points: (1) Should the exchange transaction form be made by the exchange according to the provisions of this law? (2) Should the powers and duties of the supervisors appointed by the Ministries of Finance and Industry be clearly defined? (3) Should severe penalties be imposed on brokers entrusted by civil servants for speculative trading of buying long and selling short? As a result, in principle, it could be established and should be supplemented in the articles. It was decided to separately supplement and detail it in this article, and strictly stipulate the penalty method for civil servants buying long and selling short. The text will be sorted out immediately and submitted to the General Assembly for decision on the 27th. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e25">Discussion on the Report on Industrial, Commercial and Financial Problems <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>The Chinese economic community has been engulfed in a somber atmosphere for three years. For three years, officials and citizens have been tirelessly seeking ways to revive it. However, for these three years, the dawn of prosperity has yet to appear. The future is bleak and unpredictable. Recently, the industrial and commercial sectors released a financial problem report. (See this newspaper, March 14th for the original text.) It consists of tens of thousands of words, severely criticizing current malpractices, with many pertinent points. It especially offers brilliant insights on why China should not inflate its currency. The conclusion of the article suggests that if China wants to alleviate its panic, it must start with improving the silver and capital markets. In other words, it advocates promoting bill discounting on the one hand and circulating industrial securities on the other.</p>
<p>It is undeniable that the lack of popularity of bill discounting and the lack of prevalence of industrial securities have been a major weakness in China's past economic circles. Therefore, promoting these systems is indeed a crucial plan for improving China's economic circles in the future. However, the concern is whether such systems can be realized in today's extreme panic. Even if they are forcibly implemented, will they be enough to resolve today's panic? This is also a question worth discussing.</p>
<p>Since the 20th year of the Republic of China, the national economy has been declining year by year, first with the decline of agriculture, then with the depression of industry and commerce, and then with the panic in the financial sector. Up to today, the purchasing power of the people has become smaller and smaller, and the commercial market has become narrower and narrower. As a result, the past practice of buying and selling on account has led to stagnant account receivables. The stagnation of accounts is the result of panic, not the cause of panic. Therefore, in today's situation, promoting bill discounting may only convert the result of panic, and cannot solve the cause of panic. The implementation of the bill discounting system is merely to change the past credit on account into credit on bills. In the past, the credit on account of industry and commerce became stagnant due to panic. If the cause of panic cannot be resolved, wouldn't the credit on bills still be able to make the bank's funds stagnant due to panic? Credit, whether on account or on bills, is based on the foundation of industry and commerce, and it is especially valuable if it can circulate. If industry and commerce are depressed, credit will shrink and stagnate. If industry and commerce are prosperous, credit will expand and circulate. Therefore, in times of economic prosperity, bill credit is much better than credit on account. But in times of economic panic, both are at risk of becoming stagnant. Under the discounting system, what can be discounted are time drafts and bills of exchange, and the discounting period is two or three months for long-term, and four or five days for short-term. If it is too long, the bank's funds will stagnate. Even if there is a central bank for rediscounting, its term cannot exceed two or three months. Therefore, bill discounting is effective for temporary turnover of funds, but it is not helpful for long-term circulation. Today, the stagnation of accounts receivable in China's industry and commerce is by no means temporary. Therefore, even if the bill discounting system is established, it can only be implemented once and not again. If the bank's first discount is not settled upon maturity, it will inevitably regard the second discount as a daunting task and be difficult to undertake. As for the discounting of documentary bills, it seems to be more stable. However, in today's continuous decline in prices, it may not be possible to be sure. The loss of bank silk cocoon mortgages is still a recent past fact. From this point of view, the lack of popularity of the discounting system is indeed a weakness in China's economic circles, and its development should be sought in the future. However, in today's panic, the possibility of its development is very small. Even if it can be promoted considerably, it may not be able to alleviate today's panic. This is because the stagnation of credit is the result of panic, not the cause of panic.</p>
<p>Secondly, what needs to be discussed is whether industrial securities can be popularized today. The extent to which industrial securities can be popularized is greatly affected by the environment. If the industrial securities system is to be popularized, industry must first be consolidated, and then it must be independent. Then, investors will naturally be numerous, and the circulation of securities will naturally be broad. In today's situation in China, the combined attack of external forces and internal depression makes it impossible for industry to develop. Since industrial development is not easy, the circulation of industrial securities is naturally difficult to be smooth. The former is the cause, and the latter is the result. If the former can be improved, the latter can be popularized. First, treat the root, and then you can manage the branches. Therefore, under the pressure of panic, this system may still be difficult to achieve overnight.</p>
<p>In summary, we have no objection to the promotion of the bill discounting system and the industrial securities system. What we want to discuss is that we believe that the implementation of these systems must take into account the removal of the cause of panic. If this is only regarded as the only means to resolve the cause of panic, I am afraid that it will take a lot of effort but achieve little success, resulting in doubling the effort but halving the result.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Military Affairs issued an order yesterday to all military agencies under its jurisdiction, stating: "We previously received a telegram from the chairman, issuing a circular to all military agencies that all purchases of foreign goods of various types, regardless of their size, must be reported in detail to the Third Department of the Military Commission for review and inspection. The detailed methods and procedures should be formulated in detail by the Military Commission and the Ministry of Military Affairs in consultation. For example, various mechanical instruments of the Surveying Bureau and various schools should also be handled in this way in order to avoid the drawbacks of rebates and inferior goods. The amount of direct bribery may not be very large, but its impact is that all goods with rebates must be filled with inferior goods, and may even be unusable. The harm is as great as selling the country. Therefore, the drawbacks of rebates must be strictly eliminated. In the future, those who receive commissions and rebates, regardless of the size of the amount or the name, all those related to the purchase of goods will be dealt with severely by military law. Therefore, in the future, those who receive rebates and commissions, regardless of the size of the amount or the name, all those related to the purchase of goods will be dealt with severely by military law. Following this, it is the greatest bad habit in our country to privately receive rebates for the purchase of goods. Military agencies should especially eliminate it and strictly prohibit it. Now, in accordance with the foregoing, it should be complied with. Let all agencies under your jurisdiction be informed." (Special telegram on the 22nd)</p>

<p>(Washington) Regarding the issue of Germany's rearmament, the United States may abandon its wait-and-see policy; otherwise, the United States will be isolated. This has aroused concerns in diplomatic circles here. However, senior officials of the State Department today still denied the claim of drafting a protest against Germany. Diplomatic observers stated that the United States' continued wait-and-see policy may lead to serious disputes because France has clearly announced that it cannot recognize Germany's armament plans as legitimate. The Council of the League of Nations has accepted France's application and will convene a special meeting in April to discuss this issue. The League of Nations has supported the United States' Far East policy and refused to recognize any territory occupied by any country by force. If the League of Nations decides to punish Germany, and the United States refuses to participate in this sanctions plan, then the member states of the League of Nations may undermine the United States' policy. Officials claimed that if this is the case, the United States will suffer greatly, and commerce will be severely hit. The Roosevelt government has followed the Far East policy embraced by Secretary of State Stimson during President Hoover's term without any changes. Therefore, if the League of Nations supports France and Italy in opposing Germany's rearmament, the United States must make a decision on whether to be pro-German or pro-French. Otherwise, it will lose its prestige in the Far East. (National telegram on the 21st)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Japan's attitude towards the new situation arising from Germany's decision to restore its armaments will not change and will continue its wait-and-see policy. Neither Germany nor the signatory countries of the Treaty of Versailles have contacted Japanese diplomatic representatives on this issue.

<p>Tension is no less than on the eve of the Great War in 1934.</p>
<p>(Paris) The terror of war has spread throughout Europe today. Germany, France, Russia, and Italy have ordered the mobilization of youths nationwide. Germany's abandonment of the treaty and the rejection of French and Italian protests by Germany have led the Council of the League of Nations to announce an extraordinary meeting in early April to study this tense situation. It is widely rumored that France has implemented an encirclement of Germany in military and diplomatic terms. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has followed the example of the French cabinet last week and has also ordered the extension of military service. The Italian army has now increased to over 500,000 men. France had already resolved to extend military service. Germany is also proceeding with immediate conscription and may have a large army of 600,000 men by next year. According to Russian news, the Soviet Union's standing army already has 830,000 men, and is now preparing to call up reserves and has intensified training. France is currently trying to ensure that Sunday's Berlin conference is jointly attended by Britain, France, and Italy. Detailed plans will be presented at Saturday's Paris three-power conference. Observers say that Britain wants the Berlin conference to be exploratory only, so that British Foreign Secretary Simon and Lord Privy Seal Eden will have the opportunity to discuss an equal compromise with Hitler. Simon said in the House of Commons today that Germany may be invited to attend the future three-nation conference to be held in Rome. Britain believes that if this crisis can be handled diplomatically, the danger of war can be eliminated. However, Britain has also increased its naval and military spending by more than £10 million, but there is no discussion of increasing its army. The tension in France is no less than on the eve of the Great War in 1914. (National telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) Since Germany decided to rearm, France has dispatched more troops to defend the 200-mile-long Franco-German border from Switzerland to Luxembourg. Half of these reinforcements were transferred from inland garrisons, and half were withdrawn from other borders. According to General Maurin, the Minister of War, this transfer is possible because the international situation on the other borders is stable, and there are treaties signed by France with its neighbors, so it is not necessary to strictly guard them as before. According to a Reuters telegram from Rome, Italy is also urgently fortifying its defenses. General Pesterloky, the Deputy Minister of War, said in the House of Representatives when speaking on the army budget案, that Italy has deployed more than 400,000 troops, and may still summon several levels of soldiers within days. Although Italy has decided to shorten the current military service period of 18 months, the situation in Europe may make this move temporarily impossible. (Reuters telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) At a meeting of the Army Committee of the Chamber of Deputies today to discuss armament issues, several members pointed out that the total strength of the German army could soon reach 720,000 men. Seventy percent of German factories are currently manufacturing military supplies. The factories manufacturing machine guns work seven days a week without stopping. Factories manufacturing gasoline substitutes have expanded their scope to work with all their strength. In addition, factories manufacturing other war-era supplies have also increased production. Germany is also buying large quantities of canned foods from foreign countries, such as canned sardines from Portugal, for wartime use. German aircraft factories can manufacture 15 aircraft per day, so they can manufacture 1,500 aircraft in three months. Minister of War Maurin declared to the committee that he had studied the value of France's military alliances with several countries, but France should ultimately rely on its own strength. (Havas telegram on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to an official communiqué, Minister of War Maurin recently stated to the Army Committee of the Chamber of Deputies that Germany has 36 divisions of the army, with an actual strength of 500,000 men. This is because Germany's so-called compulsory labor service system is actually equivalent to the first year of military training, so the actual number of the army is more than 500,000. Therefore, France must maintain its existing force of 260,000 men. To achieve this goal, the Minister of War requested that in addition to adopting the method of extending the term of military service in the government's declaration on March 15, the age of new recruits should be gradually reduced from 21 to 20, and the recruitment of professional troops should be intensified. In addition, the garrisons of various defense projects should be increased, and the motor vehicle fleet should be developed. Finally, the government intends to increase the manufacture of military equipment, requesting an increase in funding for the years 1935 and beyond. (Havas telegram on the 21st)</p>

<p>(Rome) Italy has now implemented the increase of its standing army to more than 500,000 men. Prime Minister Mussolini has ordered the extension of the compulsory training period, thus increasing the current number of troops by nearly double. It is learned that according to the current national defense plan, Mussolini can call up a large army of 8 million men within a few months. All men in the country between the ages of five and sixty must receive military and political training. Italy has protested against Germany's rearmament this time, but it was rejected along with France. It is reported that the Italian diplomatic note was not as strongly worded as France's, but it also stated that Germany's actions have caused a serious situation, and that any negotiations can be carried out in the future, but Italy will never recognize unilateral actions as a fait accompli. At the same time, the three-nation conference originally scheduled to be held in Rome, convened by Mussolini, has now been decided to be held in the Como area. (National telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Rome) Today, General Pesterlauki, the Minister of Military Affairs, stated in the House of Representatives when speaking on the Italian national defense plan that the government has long had a plan to shorten military service, but there is no consensus on when and how to implement it.

<p>Austen Chamberlain to Fly to Berlin Tomorrow</p>
<p>(London) Today, the House of Commons debated German rearmament. Opposition leader Lansbury began by saying that the events of the past week had caused widespread shock and a sense of despair, comparable to 1914. Germany has challenged all nations, demanding the right to tear up the Treaty of Versailles and implement rearmament. This move will inevitably plunge civilization into another devastating war. The Foreign Secretary must not allow Germany to rearm and must declare that the British government's policies are based on armaments, not rearmament. Samuel, leader of the "Samuel Liberal Party," followed, declaring that Austen Chamberlain's mission is extremely difficult. No action should be taken to hinder it. However, the German authorities misunderstand Britain's attitude. Mr. Lansbury's description of the British public's reaction to the German declaration was not overstated. Samuel concluded that Germany should be treated as an equal, but its military superiority cannot be tolerated. This statement was met with cheers in the House. Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain replied that he hoped to have sincere discussions with the German Chancellor. This trip must be undertaken with complete sincerity. It is a discussion, not to be preceded by public pronouncements. He and Lord Privy Seal Austen Chamberlain's trip to the continent is exploratory in nature. Austen Chamberlain then quoted the contents of the London Declaration of February 3, stating that Germany had then considered it fair and friendly, and subsequently sent a letter inviting him to visit Berlin. He believed that the scope and purpose of this trip should not be limited to the specific matters listed in the London communiqué. This meeting should thoroughly discuss the main points contained in that communiqué. It is necessary to make this completely clear. This trip has four main objectives: to exchange views on (1) security, (2) armaments, (3) Germany's return to the League of Nations, and (4) a European Air Convention. Germany now only needs to provide assurances that this discussion will be as broad as the one Britain has already communicated to other governments. The above four items are not only proposed, but are in fact the basis for discussion during this visit, so that an agreement can be reached to achieve a final solution. The events of the past week, as Mr. Lansbury has said, naturally aroused protests from the British, French, and Italian governments. What is the appropriate course of action is a serious question. Unilateral action has obviously raised the issue of treaty validity and is also an obstacle to future treaties. He believes that the path the British government wishes to take to deal with this serious situation is relatively appropriate. Refusing to visit Germany or canceling the visit would be of no help. Therefore, the British government requires assurances that the scope of talks will not be limited. Without negotiations and agreements on the above four items to achieve security, the current state of anxiety and panic in Europe cannot be relieved. The British government, having already lodged its reservations and protests in this environment, believes it is necessary and proper to continue this work. He would not comment on the German declaration, but it is appropriate to note that its content and nature are causing concern about the prospects for a common solution. The military strength expressed in the German declaration is enormous, far exceeding the figures put forward a year ago and beyond what the European powers could match a month ago, causing significant concern that Germany's neighbors may not be able to compromise if Germany insists on these figures. He is going to Berlin with the determination to do what Britain can to promote and maintain peace. The aim of British policy has always been to help Germany rejoin the ranks of European nations on fair terms. In any case, European peace must be preserved. The British people do not want to be accused of not doing their utmost to promote peace. We are now working to promote trust among European nations based on firm understanding and general agreement, but we do not wish to conclude special agreements between Britain and any other nation, as the solution must be universal to be solid. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>Austen Chamberlain concluded by saying, "The mission to Germany is very difficult. I dare not say that it will be successful, but to fulfill its due tasks to work for world peace, Britain is undoubtedly responsible." (Havas, 21st)</p>

<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons yesterday was criticized by the French press, with many sarcastic comments, while the Berlin newspapers unanimously praised the calm nature of the British House of Commons debate. Berlin especially welcomed Austen Chamberlain's mention of German equality. Today's German editorial stated that the attitude of the British authorities was capable, stable, and statesmanlike.

<p>(Moscow) In an article entitled "German Armaments and British Memorandum," Izvestia stated, "The German press's praise of Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain's memorandum is not without reason. Although German fascism has torn up the London Agreement, and the basis for negotiations stipulated in this agreement has disappeared, British officials will still go to Berlin." Izvestia then asked, "Then what is the basis for the Berlin Anglo-German talks?" The newspaper continued, "It would not be inappropriate to say that the practical plan for Anglo-German negotiations was determined before the signing of the London Agreement in January of this year. At that time, Lords Lothian and Hardinge visited Berlin, and today the two Lothes are working hard to promote opposition to the Eastern Pact and promote the Anglo-German Agreement. German fascism obviously wants to force European countries to take its will as their will, and the tactics of British imperialism are to cater to it, fearing or lagging behind. Hitler wants to reduce France to a second-class country and become a subject of the German Empire. The German government is working hard to prevent European countries seeking peace from concluding an agreement. The policy of British imperialism has always prevented the conclusion of this agreement, thereby promoting Germany's revenge plan, but this is a dangerous road. Although German bombers can only circle in the air over Berlin today, they may appear in the air over London tomorrow. British imperialism is still able to prevent the major countries in Europe that are deeply threatened by German fascism from concluding an agreement. Once the surprise of the broad masses of the Soviet Union and its growing strength exert pressure, the weakness and procrastination of the British side will inevitably be defeated. The strength of the Soviet Union will inevitably increase tenfold in order to defend its country. The people of Europe, especially the people of the great Soviet Union, must not be subjects of German fascism. If they encounter war, the arsonists must foresee that the anger of the masses will strike them head-on with terrible force." (Tass, 21st)</p>

<p>(Paris) Yesterday, British Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain issued a declaration in the House of Commons, stating that Germany might participate in the Rome Conference after his visit to Germany. French people were greatly surprised to hear this, because although no one opposes holding talks with Germany at a certain time, the general public believes that exchanging views with Germany is one thing, and holding talks among the British, French, and Italian countries based on the Rome Agreement of January 7 and the London Agreement of February 3 is another matter. The two matters should not be confused. Tomorrow, representatives from the British, French, and Italian countries will hold their first meeting in Paris. The three governments will jointly formulate proposals for Germany, which will be taken to Berlin by British Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain to consult with important German figures. After Austen Chamberlain returns from Germany, a second three-way meeting will be held to make a final decision. Therefore, whether from a legal or factual point of view, the three-way meeting is reasonable. As for meeting with German representatives, it must be considered after the Rome three-way meeting.

He also said that today, those who want to achieve the necessary friendship between the French and German peoples are more determined than ever. This is well known to Germany. I would like to reiterate from the podium of the French Assembly that France's policy is not an aggressive policy.

Although Germany is not currently a member of the League of Nations, there are various ways to punish it, and economic severance is the League of Nations' most effective weapon. France may propose this.

<p>(London) Finance Minister Kong announced in Shanghai yesterday that the Chinese government had received a letter from the British government, stating that it was willing to provide effective economic assistance to China in conjunction with relevant countries, and inquiring whether the Chinese authorities had formulated a plan to remedy the overall situation. This declaration aroused great attention here. There is very little accurate news here regarding the British government's document to China. It is rumored that China inquired about the possibility of a British loan last summer. At that time, the British authorities considered this suggestion difficult to implement. There is now reason to believe that a certain group friendly to China, in view of China's large silver shortage and the general political situation in the Far East, has recently inquired about the loan again from Britain. The opinion of financial circles here is that although China's tariff revenue has declined, it is still not difficult to find collateral for the loan. However, the procedures for selling this type of bond on the market are not easy to determine. It is generally believed that Britain advocates handling it through the old banking group, in order to avoid Japan from obstructing it and making the complex situation even more confusing. Furthermore, financiers now earnestly state that unless the United States declares its future intention regarding silver, China's finances cannot be finally determined. As for Britain's special attention to the overall situation in the Far East, it has been an open secret. It has now been decided that Lord Pildown will begin a debate on this matter in the House of Lords on April 3. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e76">American Gold Sales Policy: Helping Foreign Countries Restore the Gold Standard? Or Helping Foreign Countries Exchange Silver? <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) After Treasury Secretary Morgenthau sold 32,000 ounces of gold to the Mexican Bank yesterday, he stated today that the US government is prepared to sell gold to foreign countries that can offer any conditions. We have already set aside the gold we need, and we will no longer trade for the time being. The Treasury Secretary's words imply that the US government does not want to accumulate gold anymore. Some people on Wall Street believe that this is the government's gesture of willingness to release part of its gold reserves to help foreign countries restore the gold standard, but others believe that the Treasury Department is willing to sell gold and use silver as collateral, which can be seen from Mexico's purchase of gold and sale of silver. However, in any case, there is currently no indication that the United States will redistribute its gold reserves. The Treasury Department stated that the sale of gold to Mexico has no special meaning. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>(Washington) It is certain that the gold sold by the Treasury Department to Mexico and Guatemala was exchanged for silver. After this news was announced, it was rumored today that the United States may also exchange gold for China's silver. Treasury officials declared that the United States is prepared to sell gold to countries in need, and countries can exchange this gold for silver and goods. Therefore, this speculation is becoming increasingly powerful, but officials refused to discuss this issue, only saying that they will sell gold. However, other than Mexico, no negotiations have been conducted with other countries. The responsible parties also recognize that this statement is a preliminary action by the government hoping to complete the reform of the international gold standard, because American gold for silver will expand the scope of gold distribution. The Associated Press learned that the government hopes the world will adopt a new gold standard to stabilize international currencies. This is the original plan of the New Deal. It is said that the development of this matter is particularly noteworthy, because the news that the United States hopes to sell part of its gold was announced by Treasury officials. Treasury officials are concerned about the large increase in gold reserves after the US government stipulated that the gold price is $35 per ounce, for the following reasons: (1) The continuous inflow of gold into the United States will absorb foreign gold reserves. (2) The Treasury Department's huge gold reserves will weaken the power of the United States' 1934 Silver Purchase Act. The United States hopes to implement this law without disturbing the world's financial markets. It is said that since June 1934, the Treasury Department has purchased approximately 400 million ounces of silver. Experts here generally believe that since Canada and China are the main countries supplying silver to the United States, they may be more interested in gold and silver exchanges. According to reports, China raised this issue with the United States last September, but the Chinese Treasury Department's suggestion ultimately did not achieve any success. The revival of this issue will depend on China's final decision on its monetary policy. (National Electric, 21st)</p>

<p>Addis Ababa: The Abyssinian King today announced a national mobilization for war and warned the people of the country that the elite troops stationed on the border with Italian Somaliland will attack the Abyssinian army. The King seems to no longer hope that the League of Nations Mediation Committee will achieve any success, because Italy's demand for excessive compensation has still not been accepted by Abyssinia. The King's call to arms has been distributed to various provinces by administrative officials, and domestic letters and telegrams are flying around, transmitting this call to arms to places where residents gather. Abyssinia has a total of 75,000 to 100,000 troops, including the mixed forces. Although the troops commanded by the King wear uniforms, they have no shoes or socks. It is said that the mixed forces are ready to serve the King and go to war with foreign countries at any time. The Italian-Abyssinian dispute was caused by these people looting property on the border with Somaliland. Observers say that Italian military tanks and automobiles sent to Somaliland will lose their effectiveness in the mountains and forests. Abyssinian soldiers, because they grow up in the mountains and forests, have the advantage of terrain. The Italian army has not yet taken the offensive, but the border defense forces have been ordered to shoot any enemy who crosses the border. Italian Somaliland has entered a state of military readiness. The 10,000 troops transferred by Italy, accompanied by many artillery pieces, have increased the strength of the local army to 25,000 men. (National Electric, 22nd)</p>

<p>Chen Weixin Visits Han to Discuss Relief Measures</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Shandong's coastal fishing industry has always been known for its development. In recent years, it has suffered aggression from Japanese fishermen and merchants externally and various oppressions internally, leading to gradual decline and a permanent slump. To this day, fishermen along the coasts of Jiaoxian, Zhucheng, Rizhao, Wendeng, Penglai, Fushan, and Huangxian in eastern Shandong are facing extreme hardship and are crying out for food, urgently needing relief. To provide relief to coastal fishermen, Shandong Provincial Chairman Han Fuqu dispatched Provincial Councilor Chen Weixin and others to the coast to investigate the lives of fishermen and the current state of the fishing industry. Chen Weixin left Jinan and went directly to Tao'erbu and Wanggezhuang in Zhucheng County, and Shijiusuo and Taoluozhen in Rizhao for investigation, and then to Lingshanwei and other ports in Jiaoxian for inspection. After ten days of inspections, he visited more than twenty large and small ports. After completing his mission, he returned to Jinan and paid a visit to Provincial Chairman Han Fuqu this afternoon (21st) to report on the plight of coastal fishermen and relief measures. According to Chen Weixin's conversation with the reporter, "I was ordered to go to Jiaoxian, Rizhao, and Zhucheng counties along the coast to investigate the fishing industry. Whenever I arrived at a place, the Public Security Bureau would notify the fishermen to gather for training and to explain Chairman Han's intention to help the fishermen. Therefore, everyone was happy to express their grievances. According to my investigation, the reason for the decline of the fishing industry is that the salt acquisition procedures are too cumbersome. Fishermen must pay a fish tax of three dimes for every hundred catties of fish caught, and then obtain a permit to receive salt. The amount of salt received is estimated based on the size of the boat and the quantity of fish caught, calculated as thirty catties of salt for every hundred catties of fish. Most fishermen are uneducated and elect a carrier to be responsible for receiving salt and selling fish. In recent years, due to the inability to purchase salt, most of the caught fish has been abandoned and rotted. Since we do not have the strength to catch fish, foreign merchants have aggressively fished, leading to the bankruptcy of the fishing industry in this province. Tens of thousands of fishermen have no clothes or food and urgently need relief. The situation is dire. To provide relief, education is of paramount importance, with the establishment of more fishing industry organizations and fishermen's schools to enlighten their knowledge and seek the development of the fishing industry."

<h3 id="e100">Northwest Inspection Notes <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Geng Ya</p>
<p>Travel Notes on the Return Journey</p>
<p>On the return journey, from Hami to Lanzhou, although revisiting old ground, there were observations not made on the previous trip. A fixed book, even read a hundred times, is never tiresome. The Northwest border region has culture and geography that is largely undeveloped. The teeming masses and myriad things are subject to the rise and fall and extinction and growth as dictated by nature. One does not know how many treasures that have never been discovered there are. Hanyang Pass and Suoyang Ancient City have long been buried in yellow sand and white grass, and people outside the pass commonly say, "Every time you visit there, you are sure to pick up at least one antique, whether it is a brick, a tile, a small Buddha, or a precious tripod, there is no end to it." In other words, not only are Yangguan and Suoyang like this, but almost the entire Northwest border region is like this. Therefore, the most profound feeling gained by this reporter on this trip is that I feel like I have passed through a treasure mountain. Although I do not have a large knife and sharp axe to dig into the mountain and exhaust the rich and beautiful reserves, just looking at the exterior, all the auspicious grasses and strange flowers, the dew-moistened air and refreshing breezes, the lush forests and sparkling sands and stones, the oil gushing from the gullies, and the coal and salt exposed at the foot of the mountains, is enough to make people linger and sway their hearts.</p>
<p>After saying goodbye to the beauty of the Tianshan Mountains, which are covered with eternal snow, and passing through the Xingxing Gorge, with its winding mountains and meandering sand rivers, the Qilian Mountains, which straddle the border of Gansu and Qinghai provinces, also displayed their azure and serene smile, silently welcoming us from hundreds of miles away. The peaks of the Qilian Mountains are also covered with snow, but the color is grayish-white, unlike the bright and clear snow of the Tianshan Mountains, which can be seen from afar. According to observations, the more snow accumulates, the greater the pressure on the lower layers, squeezing out the air, compressing the volume, and at the appropriate freezing point or below, the "regelation phenomenon" transforms it into huge ice blocks. Due to the slope of the mountain and the gravitational pull of the earth, the ice blocks slide down, becoming "glaciers," hanging diagonally in the mountain ravines like hanging silk, the contrast of crystal clear brightness highlights the snow. The snow of the Qilian Mountains mostly does not form glaciers, and if there are any, they can also be used to pan for gold. The Tianshan Mountains are higher than the Qilian Mountains, and all the glaciers are often of unimaginable depth. The speed of glacier movement is extremely slow (the exact details can be known through scientific methods). When the glacier flows to a mountain valley with a higher temperature, the end has an extremely small amount of ice, which melts and drips, forming a water river, but it is not easy to become a large stream, and some are even evaporated. The snow and ice of the Tianshan Mountains mostly disappear into the original mountains, and then flow out into the plains, or are obtained through kaner wells. The scale of water conservancy is also beyond the reach of the Qilian Mountains, which is not just a matter of the brightness of the snow.</p>
<p>It was late winter, and the weather was bitterly cold. At Xingxing Gorge, on the border between Xinjiang and Gansu, on the way we spent the night, it had just snowed, and the wind was especially cold. Because the reporter wanted to catch the Anxi merchant convoy's car, I especially prepared four horses, and the horse owner and I each rode one, and the other two horses carried food and supplies (there was nowhere to buy them along the way after the soldiers burned it). We pressed on and advanced at the same time, setting out at dawn and not lodging until sunset. The Xingxing Gorge station is a large station consisting of two consecutive ninety-li sections. By the time we arrived, it was already after the second watch. There were no inns or homes. I entered the Guandi Temple and knocked on the postman's door to ask for lodging. In response, I learned that the person inside was not a postman, but a clerk registering postal items between Gansu and Xinjiang. He claimed that he had just finished "quietly sitting down Dan," and feared being blown by the cold wind, he only passed out the kitchen key and matches from the window seam, instructing us to open the door and cook. There were bowls, chopsticks, pots, and pans in the kitchen, as well as camel dung for fuel, but the empty jar had no water. I went out of the temple to look for a well but could not find it, and there was no one else to guide me, so I had to melt the snow in the courtyard to water the horses and filter it to cook noodles. After eating, there were faint traces of wash water on the bottom of the bowl, which froze after being placed on the table for a moment. Only then did I realize that the empty jar did not store water to prevent freezing and damaging it. The next morning, while still drowsy, I suddenly felt a slight warmth on my face. I opened my eyes and saw the horse owner carrying a lit candle, approaching the bedside. The candlelight gently illuminated my face, and I immediately felt a slight warmth. How cold the night air was could be inferred from this. The four horses were tied to the exposed trough pillars, and their exhalations condensed into frost on their lips and fur. The old horse even dripped saliva that turned into ice, intersecting like canine teeth. Later, the postman got up and led us to pick up crystals and star stones, and pointed out the location of the coal mine. As we walked and talked, he said that his name was Wang Yinglie, from Shandong, and that he had joined the Tongshanshe. He had come to this uninhabited place to find this leisurely job, so as to rest. As he spoke, his hands trembled and his head shook constantly. I asked him if he had been greatly frightened or stimulated. He replied that Mr. Hedin and his party had stayed here before, and someone else had also said that he had phlegm. In fact, "If virtue is one foot tall, the devil is ten feet tall." He had gotten this illness because of sitting quietly. I then asked him since he knew the source of the illness, why didn't he stop sitting quietly, but he did not answer. At that time, a wild horse fled in fright, so he turned to other topics and said that there were many wild horses, foxes, wolves, and rabbits here. It was very interesting to climb up high in the morning to watch them. Some wild horses are tamed by hunters, but their backs are soft and cannot be ridden.</p>
<p>Upon arriving in Anxi, just as I took the saddle off my horse, an old friend told me that my previous visit to Anxi had caused a great disaster for the people of Anxi. Shocked, I asked the reason. My friend said, "In your Northwest Inspection Notes, you briefly mentioned Anxi's production of native salt. After the Gansu Salt Transport Bureau read the newspaper, it immediately telegraphed the Anxi County Magistrate, ordering him to quickly provide a detailed report, with the intention of setting up a bureau to collect taxes. This native salt is produced far away in Caohu, and its quality and color are poor. Only a few extremely poor Mongolian people reluctantly use it to make water to add flavor. It is not worthy to be called edible salt. Previously, the neighboring Dunhuang and Yumen counties were also discovered by the Salt Bureau to produce some native salt, and at first, special commissioners were sent to collect it, but in the end, the income did not cover the expenses, so it was changed to be collected by the county government as an additional tax. Regardless of whether the farmers sell salt or not, and whether they can afford salt or not, they must be assessed and pay the tax uniformly every quarter. To this day, the local people suffer from this. Moreover, Anxi originally had nine hundred households, but because of evading heavy taxes, there are now only a little over five hundred households left. If salt tax is imposed again, the people of Anxi will have no way out," and so on. Wherever the reporter goes, I must ask about the local specialties and tell the people of the country, intending to arouse the attention of all parties, to study development and improvement, in order to make the best use of the geographical advantages. I never thought that it would cause trouble, causing the local people to worry about possessing a treasure. This is truly regrettable and was not something I had anticipated.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Xiamen Huge Robbery Case <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese-owned Fengnan Company robbed of over 30,000 yuan; Chinese and Japanese detectives conduct a massive search, apprehending five suspects</p>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: Recently, robbery cases have occurred in busy areas of Xiamen. On the 19th at noon, the Japanese-owned Fengnan Trust Company on Zhenbang Road was the site of a huge robbery of over 20,000 yuan, and a police officer named Zhang Baosheng was shot and killed. The entire city of Xiamen was shocked after the incident. Wang Gu Pan, the director of the Xiamen Public Security Bureau, immediately dispatched all detectives and police to mobilize and rigorously pursue the criminals. The Japanese Consulate also ordered all Japanese detectives to cooperate in the pursuit. The situation is extremely tense. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Zhenbang Road is located behind Haihou Nan Road and, along with Haihou and Chenguang Roads, is a gathering place for banks, money shops, and foreign firms, making it the most prosperous central market in Xiamen. The Fengnan Trust Company, located at No. 48, is operated by Taiwanese Japanese and is adjacent to the Zhongnan Bank. It has a capital of 200,000 yuan and is invested in by wealthy Taiwanese merchants. The manager, Lin Mutu, is Taiwanese. The business is very prosperous, being the largest money business in Xiamen run by Taiwanese. In addition to trust business, it also engages in remittance, advance, and other businesses. Recently, due to the brisk sales of Japanese goods in southern Fujian, remittance and advance to Taiwan are extremely developed, surpassing even the Xiamen branch of the Bank of Taiwan. On the 19th, as the Osaka regular ship Fengshan Maru was scheduled to depart for Taiwan, there were a large number of people withdrawing money and making remittances, making the business twice as busy as usual. At 12:10 PM, Manager Lin Mutu and more than a dozen clerks were in the midst of handling the overwhelming business when a man in a Western-style suit and black overcoat arrived. He sat on the long bench where customers usually sat. Soon, several more people entered, all wearing black or dark blue overcoats. However, the weather was extremely hot that day, and they were all wearing overcoats, which was quite unusual. But they were still assumed to be customers and were not paid much attention. At that moment, one person approached the counter, claiming to buy a ship ticket and remit funds. As the clerk turned to get the ticket, the man had already jumped over the counter. The others wearing overcoats also pressed forward, all taking out handguns from inside their coats. The remaining robbers entered the counter, two of them keeping watch for any outcry, two guarding the door, and the rest monitoring the cashier, Wang Yan, and the accounting clerk, Lü Zhenfang. Six robbers searched and robbed, first forcing Lin to hand over the key to the iron safe. They could not open it, so they forced Lin to open it himself. The safe had two layers. The first layer contained mortgage documents. The robbers took one envelope, opened it, and saw that it was a real estate deed. They discarded it without regard. The second layer contained money, but they did not know there was a second layer and did not open it. So, they robbed the cash and banknotes on the counter. At that time, business was busy with receipts and deposits, and over 10,000 yuan in banknotes from various banks, including the Bank of China, Central Bank, Zhongnan Bank, Industrial Bank, and Communications Bank, were completely robbed. At that time, a bundle of five-yuan banknotes, totaling 18 bundles or 9,000 yuan, was delivered from the Bank of Communications. In addition, Japanese gold notes worth 1,250 yuan were also robbed. After the robbery, they drove Lin and the clerks, along with the customers, into the toilet on the left side of the rear, cut the telephone line, and left together through the main entrance. After the robbers exited, one of the clerks followed and shouted "Robbers!" The robbers immediately opened fire as a warning. The clerk then fell silent and retreated. Coincidentally, Zhang Baosheng, a police officer from the 2nd Security Team of the Public Security Bureau, was checking the post on behalf of the squad leader and arrived in front of the Zhongnan Bank when he suddenly heard gunshots and saw several people with guns rushing out of Fengnan. Knowing it was a robbery, but Zhang was on patrol and not carrying a weapon, he asked two auxiliary police officers at the Zhongnan Bank to lend him their two Mauser pistols to help chase the robbers. The two auxiliary police officers refused. Zhang then followed the robbers. At that time, there were ten robbers. Three of them escaped separately, and the remaining seven robbers entered Shipihu Lane, passing through Buda Street and the Grandmother Temple. Zhang followed closely. When the robbers reached Dazhong Road, they split up again, four robbers fleeing towards Siming West Road and three towards Tuqi. Zhang then abandoned the pursuit towards Siming West Road and followed those towards Tuqi. The three robbers saw Zhang following closely and, as they approached Wutong Dam, Zhang was only a dozen paces away from the robbers. He heard a robber curse Zhang in the Xiamen dialect and, realizing the danger, quickly dodged. The robbers had already opened fire, firing three shots in a row, hitting Zhang in the left buttock and passing through his left thigh. He immediately fell to the ground wounded. At the same time, a 14-year-old boy named Wang Gan, a passerby, was also injured.</p>
<p>After the robbers left, Fengnan immediately borrowed a telephone to report to the Third Division of the Public Security Bureau and the Japanese Police Sub-Station of the Japanese Consulate. Liu Handong, the director of the Detective Division, Yi Jingjian, the chief of the Third Division, and Xie Shaozeng, the chief of the Public Security Bureau of Siming County, rushed to investigate one after another. Kamine, the chief of the Japanese Police Sub-Station of the Japanese Consulate in Xiamen, accompanied by Watanabe, the chief of the Judicial Affairs Section, and Sano, the chief of the section, also led Japanese detectives to investigate. Immediately, both the Chinese and Japanese sides dispatched police officers, along with clerks from Fengnan, to set out separately and conduct a thorough search in brothels, opium dens, civilian residences, and various bus stations, as well as the Fengshan Maru and Fengqing Lun, which were scheduled to depart that day. At 6 PM, two suspects, Pan Damu and Pan Ertong, were apprehended. Later, it was found that they were shop assistants at the Huaide Residence on Zhenbang Road and were released as they were not involved. That night, a Taiwanese man named Cai Gancao, who was carrying a pistol, was apprehended at a Taiwanese opium den at No. 55 Shuixian Road. He was taken back by the Japanese police for interrogation. On the 21st, Chinese and Japanese detectives continued to guard the main streets and search, including on various departing ships and even the residences of major Taiwanese figures. However, nothing was found. In the evening, according to a tip from an informant, a Taiwanese man named Huang Shuitu, who worked at the Shui Ji Trading Company at Houlutou, was involved in the Fengnan robbery. Someone had seen Huang and two others fleeing from Tuqi, and Huang had squatted down and wrapped banknotes in a towel. The Japanese police immediately went to the address to arrest Huang and two of his shop assistants. Huang vehemently denied it. However, his shop assistants claimed that Huang had gone out at 11 AM that morning and returned to the shop around 12 noon. They had seen him and a gambling house clerk wrapping something unknown in newspaper. After interrogation, they were temporarily detained. Furthermore, at Li Zongjiu's residence at No. 14 Guangping Lane, Li and a Taiwanese man named Chen Jinzhi were arrested. Around 11 PM, two Taiwanese men named Huang Shuisheng and Zhang Dingyuan were arrested at the Anda Hotel on Siming West Road. Over a hundred yuan in banknotes were found on Huang's person. The Japanese police took them away for interrogation. All five are suspected, and the case has not yet been solved.</p>
<p>Wang Gu Pan, the Director of the Xiamen Special Public Security Bureau, was extremely angered by the occurrence of this case. Since robbery cases had occurred mostly within the jurisdiction of the Third Division, and the Fengnan robbery case was also within the jurisdiction of that division, he immediately ordered the dismissal of Yi Jingjian, the chief of the Third Division, and transferred Wang Zhengju to succeed him as the chief of the Third Division, with a strict deadline to solve the case.

<p>562 Businesses Closed in Five Years</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Jiujiang is one of China's Yangtze River trading ports and the gateway for imports and exports of Jiangxi. In recent years, the decline of Xunbu's commerce and finance has been rapid. According to the Statistics Office of the Provincial Government, from the 18th to the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the money industry decreased by 18 firms, the egg and timber industries decreased by 9 firms, the cotton industry decreased by 12 firms, the grain industry decreased by 49 firms, the porcelain industry decreased by 26 firms, the charcoal industry decreased by 30 firms, the Jiangsu and Zhejiang foreign goods industry decreased by 19 firms, the oil, salt, and sundry goods industry decreased by 43 firms, the rice industry decreased by 55 firms, and customs declaration and transshipment warehouses decreased by 27 firms. In total, the number of new businesses in various industries in five years was only 67, while the total number of closed businesses reached 562. Comparing the two, there was a net decrease of 495 firms. The decline of commerce is truly alarming. Even in terms of finance, although on the surface it seems that the number of banks is increasing daily, it is also because of the bankruptcy of the rural economy, with cash concentrating in urban areas. Due to the decline of industry and commerce, the deposits received cannot be lent out, forming a phenomenon of "cerebral hemorrhage and withered limbs." The future is difficult to be optimistic about. Moreover, since the Republic of China, imports have gradually increased sharply in the province, and exports by the 20th year of the Republic of China, the trade deficit reached over 20 million Haikwan taels. If such a large amount of cash outflow is not urgently addressed, there will eventually be a day of exhaustion. (3/18)</p>

<p>Li Zehuan, the chief of the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau in Tinglin Town, Songjiang County, was previously accused by the people of having no achievements after serving for a year and of accepting bribes and conniving with drug offenders. After the Civil Affairs Department sent someone to secretly investigate and found the accusations to be true, Director Yu personally approved the dismissal and detention of the branch chief, Li Zehuan. He Yongyao, the director of the bureau, was found to have failed to investigate properly and was given a major demerit in accordance with the regulations for joint responsibility for the appointment of public security personnel.</p>

<p>Zhu Shouli and Zhu Liren, farmers in Wujia Village southwest of Malu Town, have been involved in lawsuits for many years due to disputes over inheriting the estate of a relative. Their resentment was deep. On the 14th of this month, another dispute over inheritance led to a verbal argument, followed by a physical fight. Shouli's youngest son, Xiaodi, injured Liren's head. Liren went to the county seat that day to have the injury examined and died on the morning of the 18th due to the severity of the injury. After the family reported the death, County Magistrate Xu went to the village on the 20th to examine the body. Because Liren had no children, his body remains uncoffined to this day. The murderer, Zhu Xiaodi, has been apprehended and detained.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Suzhou: Request to Reduce Electricity Rates Reaches a Stalemate <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The various silk weaving industries in Suzhou, in order to request a reduction in motor electricity rates, dispatched representatives Liu Fuqing, Lu Jigao, and She Wenqing to Beijing to petition the Central Construction Committee. This has already been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that after the representatives petitioned, they returned to Suzhou yesterday (the 22nd). It is said that the motor electricity rate has been reduced from 8.5 fen per kilowatt-hour to 6 fen, which should be no problem. The base price of the motor electricity meter is 1.4 yuan per meter. Large users suffer only limited losses, but small users suffer significant losses, which has not been resolved. The electricity rate for lamps is 2 jiao per kilowatt-hour. Users proposed to change it to 1.8 jiao, but the factory has not agreed. Therefore, the various industries are deeply dissatisfied and have submitted a petition to the county party headquarters, requesting permission to organize the Suzhou Electricity Users Association. The party headquarters is currently deliberating.</p>

<p>Zhu Shusheng, the president of the Jiangsu Higher Court, received a report that prisoners in Songjiang County Jail suddenly broke free from their fetters around 5 PM on the 18th of this month and rushed out, cutting the telephone lines in the warden's office and tying up the guards. Fourteen prisoners escaped at the same time. President Zhu was enraged and specifically telegraphed the county magistrate of Songjiang County yesterday (the 22nd), ordering that the prison warden, Li Shuzhang, be suspended and placed under surveillance and handed over to the County Court Prosecutor's Office for investigation and legal proceedings.</p>

<p>Gu Tongsun, the former director of land tax in Yixing County, and his younger brother, Gu Kangsun, were detained for corruption but suddenly escaped. Chu Kaiyao, the judicial secretary of the county, had acted as Gu's guarantor and, fearing punishment, also fled. Zhong Jingcheng, the county magistrate, detained Chu's wife, Shao, for questioning, causing her injuries. Chu's family sent telegrams to appeal. The Jiangsu Higher Court ordered Qian Chengjun, the chief prosecutor of the local branch court, to go to Yixing to examine the injury and investigate. At the same time, Gu Tianzhen's wife, Gu Wang, accused County Magistrate Zhong of abuse. The Jiangsu Higher Court also ordered Ren Guanghai, an inspecting officer from the local branch court of Wuxi, to go to Yixing to investigate. Both cases were reported to the Jiangsu Higher Court for review. The Jiangsu Higher Court has now designated the local branch court of Wuxi to have jurisdiction over the above two cases and has sent all case files for review. Upon receiving the order, Chief Qian of Wuxi will soon issue warrants to summon the original defendants, Chu Shao, Gu Wang, and Zhong Jingcheng, to appear in court for investigation in accordance with the law.</p>

At the Sanyuan Temple, they viewed the Ming edition of the Tripitaka. At 4 PM on the 21st, people from all walks of life held a welcome meeting at the Nantong Theater, presided over by Commissioner Zheng. Zhao spoke about the administrative policy of Jiangsu Province, and Zhu spoke about the significance of land reform. At 7 PM in the evening, people from all walks of life held a public banquet at the club. Zhao and Zhu originally intended to go to the coastal areas of San Yu and Lüsi to inspect the reclamation and salt areas, but were unable to do so due to the snow.

<p>The Standing Committee meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees of the Jiangsu Provincial Chamber of Commerce was held at the Changzhou Chamber of Commerce around 3 PM on the 21st. Fourteen people attended, including Yu Xiaochuan, Qian Sunqing, and Cheng Ganqing. Yu Xiaochuan chaired the meeting. The rituals were performed as usual. Reporting items (omitted). Discussion items: (1) The chambers of commerce of Yixing, Zhenjiang, Wujin, Wuxi, Qingpu, Gaoyou, and Fengxian successively sent letters and telegrams stating that the Provincial Government meeting on February 26 passed the regulations for collecting house donations in various counties of the province and requested that reasonable arguments be made to the Provincial Government to stop the implementation because of the difficulties of the people in Jiangsu, etc. After a letter was sent to the Provincial Donation and Tax Supervision Committee suggesting that the Provincial Government should quickly stop the implementation, a reply was received that the meeting had two opinions and suggested that the Provincial Government investigate and handle the matter accordingly. Should the Chamber continue to appeal? It was resolved that the Chamber would summarize the opinions of the chambers of commerce of various counties, truthfully submit them, and request a stop to the implementation in order to alleviate the difficulties of the people in Jiangsu and avoid disturbances. (2) The Rugao County Chamber of Commerce and the Rugao County Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Office telegraphed to report a dispute over spot checks of stamp tax and requested an investigation and handling. How should this case be handled? It was resolved that since both parties had filed lawsuits separately, they should quietly await the judicial authorities to investigate and handle the matter. (3) The Wuxian and Wujin County Chambers of Commerce proposed that the new stamp tax law newly formulated by the Ministry of Finance has not yet been promulgated. During this transition period between the old and new laws, merchants are prone to misunderstandings. It is requested that the new law be promulgated as soon as possible and that inspections be temporarily suspended before the new law is promulgated to avoid disturbances. At the same time, the new stamp tax law should be promulgated as soon as possible. Please vote for the resolution. It was resolved to pass. (4) The Wuxian Chamber of Commerce and other six groups launched a memorial meeting for Mr. Shi Yunqing. Please include the Chamber's name as a sponsor and forward it to the chambers of commerce of various counties and towns to participate. The resolution was passed. (5) After inquiring about the qualifications of alternate members of the Chamber of Commerce, the Ministry and Province ordered the transfer of the resolution of the Unified Legislation Conference to the Chamber. Since Mr. Yuan Zhensheng, a member of the Executive Committee of the Chamber, was vacant due to illness in August of last year, should he be re-elected in accordance with this explanation? Please vote for the resolution. It was resolved that Xu Yao, an alternate member of the Executive Committee, should be re-elected. (6) The Yixing County Chamber of Commerce proposed that the business tax rate for oil and sauce be changed to three levels, collecting 2/1000. Oil and sauce are daily necessities for the people. At this time of rural collapse and overall social and economic upheaval, the people are truly unable to bear it. It is requested to submit a request to continue to tax the oil and sauce tax rate at 2/1000 as before in order to maintain the food of the people and relieve the difficulties of merchants. It was resolved to investigate and handle the case as appropriate. (7) The Chamber's income and expenditure report for January should be submitted to the Supervisory Committee for review. The resolution was passed.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Danyang: Conflict Between River Workers and Security Team Soldiers <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Due to the impact of the drought in the past year, the counties south of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu Province suffered severe droughts, with thousands of miles of barren land and no harvest. The livelihood of farmers was completely cut off. In order to relieve the people in the disaster areas, the government, in addition to raising and distributing emergency relief, also had the act of hiring laborers to dredge the canal. The laws, beauty, intention, and goodness need not be mentioned. Since the start of the work, nearly 20,000 laborers recruited in Jintan County have been assigned to work on various sections along the canal, which has been quite active. However, what one person makes each day is not enough for one person to eat each day. The misery can be imagined. Therefore, the laborers often complain. The security team soldiers stationed in Erling Town, Danyang, were ordered to protect the workers. Suddenly, they had a conflict with the laborers. Yesterday (the 19th) afternoon, the guards suddenly arrested two labor foremen, Li and Qian. When the laborers found out, they gathered at the security team's garrison to question them. Li Zhenyu, the captain of the team, was unable to answer. The labor foremen wanted to rush into the garrison. Seeing this, the security team soldiers immediately raised their guns and fired at the workers as a show of self-defense. (?) As a result, a laborer named Dai Jinxu was killed on the spot, and several laborers, including Chen, were injured. The crowd was enraged for a time. The security team soldiers, seeing that they had caused a major disaster, quickly took the two labor foremen, Li and Qian, and the team back to the Fifth Brigade Headquarters in Danyang, claiming that the laborers had rioted, robbed firearms, and kidnapped a soldier named Li Yunduan. The county magistrate and commander of the Fifth Brigade immediately telegraphed the county magistrate of Jinhuai County, Qi Lunjie, to jointly inspect the scene of the incident in order to find a proper solution. However, after all the dredging laborers learned of this incident, they all went on strike, which had a significant impact on the project. There is still no news of a resolution.</p>

<p>Scheduled to Depart for Japan at 6 AM Tomorrow Morning</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the "Asahi 110," a visiting aircraft from the Asahi Shimbun Company of Tokyo and Osaka, Japan, specially permitted by our government and piloted by Hyakuzo Shinno and Kenji Tsukagoshi, arrived in Nanjing at 5:30 PM on the 20th. There, they paid respects at the mausoleum, visited various government officials, and attended a welcome banquet hosted by the press. Yesterday, they departed from Nanjing at 12:37 PM and arrived in Shanghai at 1:52 PM, landing at Longhua Airport. The Shanghai Municipal Government specially prepared a welcome reception at the airport. Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Japanese Ambassador Akira Ariyoshi, and others personally welcomed them, with hundreds in attendance. At 4 PM, the Japanese Consul-General held a tea party. At 7 PM, the Japan Press Association hosted a banquet. The aircraft is scheduled to depart for Japan at 6 AM on the 24th. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Reception Venue Arrangement Beforehand, the Municipal Government sent personnel to erect two welcome arches at the airport. Inside the hangar, hundreds of seats were arranged for refreshments. Large Chinese and Japanese national flags were hung on the walls. Countless Party and national flags were crisscrossed on the seats. To maintain order, anyone without an entrance pass or car pass was prohibited from entering the second gate. The Public Security Bureau band played music to welcome the visitors.</p>
<p>Welcoming Personnel From yesterday noon, the road leading to Longhua Airport was lined with vehicles. Security personnel guarded the route. In addition to Mayor Wu Tiecheng, the Chinese side included Municipal Government Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, Section Chief Li Dachao, Secretaries Zhang Tingrong and Tang Shixuan, Specialist Wang Changchun, Councilor Jin from the Garrison Headquarters, Deputy Adjutant-General Gan, Shanghai Security Bureau Director Yang Hu, Public Security Bureau Chief Inspector Huang, North Station Branch Director Liang Fuchu, Director Yu Ming and Secretary Zhou Jue of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, and Yao Xijiu of the Chinese Aviation Association. On the Japanese side were Ambassador Akira Ariyoshi, First Secretary Horiuchi of the Japanese Embassy, Chinese Affairs Secretary Arino, Army Assistant Officer Itta, Navy Assistant Officer Kobetto, Information Department Chief Ashino Hiroshi, Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai Ishii Jutaro, and Chairman of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce, Yoneri, among hundreds of others. Japanese men, women, and elementary school students made up more than half of the welcoming crowd, waving Chinese and Japanese national flags to show their welcome. Dai Enji, manager of China National Aviation Corporation, oversaw all arrangements on site.</p>
<p>Landing Details At 1:47 PM, the "Asahi 110" was spotted in the northeastern sky. It landed three minutes later, slowly taxiing to the reception area. Pilots Shinno and Tsukagoshi leaned out of the cockpit window and saluted the welcoming crowd to the sound of military music. After the aircraft stopped, personnel from the Public Security Bureau conducted a detailed inspection in accordance with foreign aircraft entry regulations. Both pilots were in high spirits. Upon disembarking, they were immediately surrounded by Chinese and foreign reporters for photographs and film footage. The aircraft is a monoplane, painted grass green, with the Asahi logo under the wings. It is a semi-locally made Japanese aircraft manufactured in February of Showa 9 (1934), with one 600-horsepower engine and a top speed of 270 miles per hour. It also carried three letters of greeting to the Mayor of Shanghai and the citizens from the mayors of Tokyo and Osaka, and the presidents of the two Asahi Shimbun companies.</p>
<p>Grand Welcome Mayor Wu and others shook hands with both pilots one by one, exchanging brief greetings. Miss Liang Xue'er and Miss Liang Xueji then stepped forward to present flowers. Several Japanese women also represented Japanese Consul-General Ishii Jutaro, the Shanghai Nichinichi Shimbun, the Shanghai Japanese Reporters' Association, the Shanghai Resident Association, and the Banzai Hall, presenting fresh flowers or paper flowers. They were then led into the reception area, where Mayor Wu presided over a welcome meeting, with light refreshments and yellow wine.</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech At the welcome reception, Mayor Wu said in his address, "Distinguished guests, Mr. Shinno, Mr. Tsukagoshi, today the Tokyo and Osaka Asahi Shimbun's aircraft has flown to China and landed in our city. As the local host, I extend a warm welcome on behalf of the entire city to your company's goodwill in sending this aircraft to visit China. I also express my deep respect and appreciation for the spirit of Mr. Shinno and Mr. Tsukagoshi who piloted this aircraft. The progress of transportation is indeed an important factor in promoting world politics, and the development of aviation can break through many natural and material obstacles in the universe, increasing opportunities for mutual assistance and cooperation among various ethnic groups, and even eliminate various spiritual barriers between ethnic groups, and improve international relations between them. Our two countries, China and Japan, have a very long and close relationship in history and geography. Our cultures and institutions, our customs and habits, are not only related to each other, but also not far apart. They can indeed be said to be two brotherly countries of the same culture and the same race. Recently, Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations have gradually shown signs of improvement, which is truly gratifying. We are especially grateful for the kindness of your aircraft's visit to China. Today, we respectfully accept the goodwill brought by your aircraft. At the same time, we sincerely hope that your aircraft can bring to your country the spirit of the kingly way of culture that the Chinese nation has cherished for thousands of years, which values faith and peace, and, through your newspaper, which is the most authoritative in your country's public opinion, spread this spirit widely to your compatriots, so as to completely eliminate the spiritual barriers between the two brotherly countries and increase the belief in the coexistence and co-prosperity of the two nations. I wish your aircraft a safe return journey, and I wish Mr. Shinno and Mr. Tsukagoshi good health."</p>
<p>Japanese Response Following this, Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai Ishii Jutaro delivered a speech, saying in essence, "We are very grateful for the grand reception given to the Asahi aircraft's visit to your country. We are especially pleased that this will enhance goodwill between China and Japan." Next, Mr. Kamio Shigeru, Director of the Eastern Department of the Tokyo and Osaka Asahi Shimbun, spoke, saying, "In the Sui and Tang Dynasties, it took a month for a journey between China and Japan, which was extremely inconvenient, so there was little interaction in diplomatic relations. Although there has been great progress now, compared to the dense network of air routes between European and American countries, the convenience and speed of travel are quite backward. Therefore, we sincerely hope that East Asia can catch up quickly to seek progress." Finally, pilot Shinno answered, translated by Wang Changchun, saying, "This time, I piloted the aircraft from Tokyo via Osaka and Korea, arriving in Nanjing the day before yesterday and arriving in Shanghai today. This new route is related to both China and Japan. We are very grateful for the banquet given by your country's authorities in Nanjing. After arriving in Shanghai, we received a warm welcome from the Mayor and all sectors of society, which almost brought tears to my eyes. We are scheduled to fly back on the original aircraft at 6 AM the day after tomorrow (tomorrow). We sincerely hope that this trip will strengthen the relationship between Shanghai and Osaka and make it closer, and report your country's enthusiasm to the whole country. Thank you."</p>
<p>Japanese Consul's Tea Party After the welcome ceremony, Japanese Consul-General accompanied Mr. Shinno and Mr. Tsukagoshi to the consulate, and then to the Banzai Hall on Seymour Road for a short rest. At 4 PM, Japanese Consul-General Ishii Jutaro held a tea party at his private residence on Seymour Road to entertain the two pilots and guests from all walks of life. Attendees included Section Chief Li Dachao and Secretary Tang Shixuan of the Municipal Government, Shanghai Security Bureau Director Yang Hu, Yu Ming of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, Jianghai Customs Superintendent Tang Haian, Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Chairman Yu Zuoting, banking leaders Lin Kanghou and Dian Shoumin, and prominent figures Du Yuesheng and Zhang Xiaolin, as well as Japanese officers, and Chinese and foreign press, totaling about 200 people. The Ishii couple hosted the event, and several young Japanese women served tea and refreshments. The guests chatted and laughed happily. Mr. Shinno and Mr. Tsukagoshi were especially welcomed by the guests. The Chinese Aviation Association also presented a pair of antique vases, inscribed with the words "Magnificent Flight," which lasted until 6 PM.</p>
<p>Press Association Banquet The Shanghai Press Association hosted a banquet at the Xinghualou Restaurant on Fuzhou Road at 8 PM last night. On the host side were Wang Boqi, Zhou Mengxiong, Wu Tingchen, Yu Songhua, Ma Yinliang, Qian Bohan, Qian Hua, Wang Shenwei, Li Haoran, Yan Duhe, Wang Weizhen, Zhu Yinong, Yao Junyu, Lu Yi, Wang Jilu, Lai Guangfu, Shao Jizhi, Pan Gongbi, Xiong Shaohao, Xiang Yuancun, Zheng Xitao, Pan Gongzhan, He Xiya, Xiu Fang, Xu Zhuodai, Guan Ji'an, Qian Cangshuo, Yuan Yeyu, Lin Baisheng, Ye Xuesong, Zhao Muru, Guo Xiufeng, and Xu Xinyi.

Accompanying guests were Kinoshita Moriyama, Imai, and Kurai of the Asahi Shimbun; Tachibana and Murakami of the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun; Shimojo and Ishida of the Dentsu News Agency; Matsumoto and Zhuangyuan of the Nihon Rengo Tsushin; Akakami of the Tokyo Jiji Shinpo; Otsuki of the Hochi Shimbun; Ishikawa and Ito of the Nichinichi Shimbun; Hada and Goto of the Shanghai Nichiho; Fukamachi and Otorii of the Shanghai Nichinichi Shimbun; and Yamada Gisaburo of the Shanghai Weekly. Halfway through the banquet, the chairman, Mr. Wang Boqi, General Manager of the Xinwenbao, delivered a welcome speech, which was translated by Mr. Hu Yizang, saying, "I am very honored to represent the Shanghai Press Association today to welcome Mr. Hyakuzo Shinno and Mr. Kenji Tsukagoshi of the Tokyo and Osaka Asahi Shimbun who have flown to visit the Republic of China. The Shanghai and other local press colleagues are all envious of the two gentlemen's sea crossing and long-distance visit. We have always known that your country's newspapers are progressing rapidly, and all the scales and equipment are sufficient for our country's newspapers to emulate. Now that Mr. Shinno and Mr. Tsukagoshi, representing the most advanced Tokyo and Osaka Asahi Shimbun in Japan, have come to visit our country, all of us in the press hope that you will give us more instruction and serve as a reference for our country's newspapers. At the same time, we feel that the development of the press must rely on the progress of transportation, and the aviation industry has a great contribution to the transmission of information and the delivery of newspapers for the press. Now, the Asahi Shimbun can provide its own aircraft to travel to our country, which shows the perfection of the equipment, and today's safe arrival in Shanghai, we can gather together, which shows the talent of the flight technicians, which really makes us admire very much. Now, I would like to propose a toast, wishing the Asahi Shimbun's development, the health of the two gentlemen, and please the two gentlemen not to hesitate to give us advice."</p>
<p>Japanese Guests' Response After Mr. Wang finished his speech, Mr. Hyakuzo Shinno stood up to reply, translated by Yamada Gisaburo, saying, "I am very grateful for the hospitality of the Shanghai Press Association today. This time, our Asahi aircraft departed from Tokyo and traveled safely all the way to Nanjing and Shanghai, creating a new record for flights between China and Japan, and can promote friendly relations between the two countries. We are very willing to continue to work hard to connect the feelings of the two countries. We will definitely report your country's hospitality to our country's citizens, hoping that the people of the two countries will maintain continuous friendship, and so on." Next, Mr. Kamio Shigeru, Director of the Eastern Department of the Asahi Shimbun, and Mr. Hada Hiroshi of the Shanghai Nichiho, successively gave speeches, both expressing that the Asahi aircraft's flight to China this time has created a record for the connection between the press circles of China and Japan, and hoping that China will also send aircraft to visit Japan in the near future. The Japanese press and all the people will definitely welcome it with the same enthusiasm. The guests chatted happily during the banquet, which did not end until about 10 PM.</p>
<p>Brought Letters The Asahi visiting aircraft came to Shanghai, bringing a letter from Mr. Ueno Seiichi, President of the Asahi Shimbun, to the Shanghai press, translated as follows: "To the gentlemen of the Shanghai Press Association: The two countries, China and Japan, which have always been friendly, have mistakenly entered a thorny path for more than a day. However, recently the situation has changed, and it has returned to the original relationship of mutual support between China and Japan. This is a very gratifying thing for the peace of China, Japan, and East Asia. This is all due to your excellent insight, the guidance of fair public opinion, and continued efforts. I would like to entrust our company's first Sino-Japanese civil aircraft, which is meaningful in connecting the capitals of Nanjing and Tokyo, to express my deep gratitude for the efforts of your colleagues and express my full respect. At the same time, I take this opportunity to wish you all good health and hope that you will make further efforts for the peace of East Asia and the friendship between China and Japan. Ueno Seiichi, President of the Osaka Tokyo Asahi Shimbun."</p>

<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, the five million yuan for small industrial and commercial credit loans to help the market has now been fully raised. The banking syndicate is being formed immediately, and the money shops' expansion of loans has already been implemented. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Formation of a Banking Syndicate</p>
<p>The subcommittee of the Bankers Association has resolved to form a banking syndicate to handle the five million yuan small industrial and commercial credit loan case. The issue of inviting member money shops of the Money Shops Association to join the cooperation has been negotiated by Chen Guangfu, Chairman of the Bankers Association, and Qin Runqing, Chairman of the Money Shops Association, and a request has been submitted to the Ministry of Finance for an allocation of 2.5 million yuan to jointly form a banking syndicate for management. At the same time, Chen Guangfu, Chairman of the Bankers Association, had asked for instructions on the measures when he met with Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi the day before. Mr. Kong expressed his approval of the subcommittee's measures.</p>
<p>Fully Raised</p>
<p>The Bankers Association has already sent separate letters to its member banks, requesting them to report the number of small industrial and commercial credit loans they have identified within a time limit, so that they can be implemented as soon as possible. However, according to the New Voice News Agency reporter's investigation, the government's allocation of 2.5 million yuan has already been ordered by Minister Kong to be joined by the Central Bank to form a banking syndicate. As for the member banks of the Bankers Association, the subcommittee has also negotiated properly with the various banks and has identified 2 million yuan, of which 1 million yuan is from Bank of China, 500,000 yuan from Bank of Communications, and the remaining amount is identified by the member banks. If the money shops refuse to join, the identified banks will increase the amount proportionally to 2.5 million yuan.</p>
<p>Loans to Start Next Week</p>
<p>The member banks of the Bankers Association that have decided to join the banking syndicate, such as Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Shanghai Bank, Zhongnan Bank, Continental Bank, Jin City Bank, Salt Industry Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, China Industrial Bank, Kenye Bank, Xiye Bank, Guohuo Bank, Tongshang Bank, Guohua Bank, and Siming Bank, have decided to jointly establish a small industrial and commercial credit loan banking syndicate with the Central Bank. The establishment of this banking syndicate will be within the next week, and will be affiliated to the Central Bank or Bank of China in the future. Loan measures have also been drafted.</p>
<p>Money Shops' Attitude</p>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reporter inquired from the money shops yesterday. The Money Shops Association resolved at a provisional meeting of member representatives on the 15th of this month to expand credit loans without adding a banking syndicate. Now, all 57 member money shops have accepted the persuasion of Chairman Tai Runqing and have implemented the expansion. Therefore, the Money Shops Association's resolution on the subcommittee's decision to require continued accession will be based on the previous resolution's measures. Furthermore, the resolution of the change of the general meeting cannot be made without holding another general meeting.</p>

<p>According to the Kuomintang News Agency, the New Life Movement Association's inspection tour group, consisting of Xu Qingyu, Zhang Yuchong, Lin Xueyan, and Yu Zhongqi, continued their group inspections of the New Life Movement yesterday. Leader Xu also expressed his thoughts on the inspection of the New Life Movement in Shanghai to a reporter from the Kuomintang News Agency and convened a tea party at the Municipal Government with leaders from various sectors and principals and discipline directors of major middle schools and universities. At 6:50 PM, they left Shanghai for Hangzhou to inspect the New Life Movement in Zhejiang. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Group Inspections Continued Yesterday</p>
<p>Zhang Yuchong, a New Life Movement Inspector in the first group, accompanied by Yang Dean from the Shanghai New Life Movement Association, went to Zhenru for inspection. Upon arrival in Zhenru, they were accompanied by President Shen of Jinan University, Secretary-General Dian, Dean of Student Affairs Wu, and Chen Zhongfu, leader of the 11th branch of the Shanghai New Life Movement Youth Service Corps, to inspect the first directly affiliated district branch, the 11th district education center, the 11th branch of the Youth Service Corps, the entire office of Jinan University, the area along Station Road, the area along Jiaotong Road, and the Southeast Medical College. The second group, Inspector Lin Xueyan, at 8:00 AM yesterday morning, accompanied by Gu Ruofeng dispatched by the Shanghai New Life Movement Association, took a car directly to the Dongjiadu Pier in Nanshi. When they arrived at the Dongchang Road Pier by municipal ferry, they were welcomed by the Pudong Fire Brigade with two cars, as well as Shen Ping, Standing Committee member of the Fifth District Party Headquarters and concurrently leader of the Fifth Branch of the New Life Youth Service Corps, Zhang Mingqin, Director of the Pudong Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and concurrently Deputy Leader of the Youth Service Corps, Xu Baoming, head of the Yangjing District Defense Corps in Shanghai, Zhang Zaibo, Principal of Yangjing Middle School, and others.

<p>Lecture at Yangjing Middle School</p>
<p>After Inspector Lin finished inspecting Yangjing Middle School, the student self-government association of Yangjing Middle School sent representatives to request instructions. Immediately, over 300 students were gathered, stood solemnly on the playground, and listened to the lecture. Lin said, in brief, "Today, I came to your school for inspection. I am very grateful that you have requested a lecture on the New Life Movement. It would be a long discussion, but to save valuable time, I will simply say that it is about incorporating neatness, simplicity, cleanliness, and plainness into daily life, using it as a standard for daily discipline in schools, making it a daily habit in families, and treating propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame as the creed of young students. If you can implement it in everything you do, even if you cannot achieve it completely, the results will be considerable."</p>
<p>Afternoon Tea Party at the Municipal Government</p>
<p>Because the four inspectors had completed their inspection in Shanghai, the Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association specially convened a tea party at the Municipal Government at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, gathering principals and discipline directors of major middle schools and universities in Shanghai, as well as heads of various agencies and leaders from various sectors.

Director Pan first gave a welcome speech, hoping that the four inspectors of the New Life Movement would offer detailed criticisms of the New Life Movement in Shanghai to serve as a guide.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Speaks on the New Life Movement</p>
<p>Then, Xu Qingyu, leader of the inspection group, gave a speech, saying, in brief, "I was ordered to come to Shanghai to inspect the New Life Movement, and today it has been completed. The construction of the city center area and the promotion of the New Life Movement in Shanghai have made great progress due to the leadership of responsible party and government personnel and leaders from various sectors. The increase in administrative efficiency and the enthusiasm of the service corps are indeed good phenomena. Moreover, the youth service corps stand at attention and salute when mentioning Premier Sun and Chairman Chiang, which shows the enthusiasm of these young people in supporting the leaders, which makes me even more motivated. However, during this inspection, there are still one or two minor shortcomings, but I deeply believe that the sincerity of the Shanghai municipal authorities and leaders from various sectors in promoting the New Life Movement will lead to unlimited progress in the future. However, what we must pay attention to is the method of promoting the New Life Movement. I believe that the promotion of the New Life Movement should be the joint responsibility of schools and families. If families and schools can implement the New Life Movement, then children and students will inevitably be influenced. We should clearly understand that the success or failure of the New Life Movement is of great importance to the country and the nation. You are leaders from all walks of life in Shanghai. If you can effectively promote the New Life Movement, not only will the New Life Movement in Shanghai make progress, but the whole country will also be inspired."</p>
<p>Speeches by Leaders from Various Sectors</p>
<p>Next, Ou Yuanhuai gave a speech, saying, in brief, "School education is for cultivating knowledge and character, and the purpose of the New Life Movement is also to cultivate the knowledge of being a person. In other words, it is to cultivate a citizen with a sound personality." Then, Zhang Shouyong gave a speech, saying, in brief, "School textbooks are currently unable to be unified, and the inherent Chinese morality cannot be fully incorporated. In the future, when compiling textbooks, I hope that more of the New Life Movement guidelines will be adopted." Later, Shen Junru gave a speech, saying that the promotion of the New Life Movement should start with oneself, with one's position, with small things, with the family, and with the entire society, so that there will be progress.</p>
<p>Mayor and Bureau Directors Respond</p>
<p>Finally, Mayor Wu gave a response, saying, in brief, "The New Life Movement inspection tour group has completed its inspection in Shanghai, and it should have a judgment on the New Life Movement in Shanghai. Is there still anything incomplete in the New Life Movement, or anything that cannot be implemented? The inspectors come from Nanchang, the birthplace of the New Life Movement, and have stayed in Shanghai for five days. They should have a judgment on the New Life Movement in Shanghai. We sincerely hope that Director Xu will give us guidance so that we can gain a new direction in promoting the New Life Movement. We believe that when the four inspectors come to Shanghai again for inspection, the New Life Movement in Shanghai will make progress. The New Life Movement is a movement for building the country and revitalizing the nation. If the New Life Movement can succeed, then we can build the country and revitalize the nation. We know that the hope of a family lies in the talent of its children, and the strength of a country and nation depends on the revitalization of the national spirit. We also know that the interpretation of phenomena is a total expression of a nation's life. By observing this total expression of a nation's life, we can determine the strength or weakness of this nation. We hope that those who implement the New Life Movement can strive to promote it at all times, day by day, month by month, year by year, and throughout their lives, following the outline of the New Life Movement. Only then can the New Life Movement be popularized." Finally, Director Wu Xingya gave a thank-you speech, in addition to thanking the inspectors and guests for their instructions, he also added a detailed explanation of the four characters of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame, and encouraged the education sector to do its best to promote the New Life Movement.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Talks about His Impressions of the Inspection</p>
<p>Xu Qingyu, leader of the New Life Movement Association inspection tour group, and his party of four, came to Shanghai for a five-day inspection and had an excellent impression, especially with high hopes for the Youth Service Corps organized by the New Life Movement Association. Yesterday, Mr. Xu expressed his impressions of the inspection to a reporter from the Kuomintang News Agency, saying, "Since the implementation of the New Life Movement in Shanghai, it has aroused the attention of people from all walks of life. Although its effectiveness has not been fully demonstrated, it is probably because the environment is mixed with Chinese and foreigners, and the environment is harsh, which cannot be achieved in a short period of time. We have had quite a few impressions from our recent inspections, which can be told to people from all walks of life in Shanghai: (1) The local party, government, and military authorities are united, and public officials can use scientific methods in handling affairs, such as the storage of files in various bureaus of the municipal government and the organization of social statistical surveys, all of which are well-organized and more advanced than the inland agencies. (2) The cleanliness and tidiness of the internal affairs of agencies and schools have been achieved, but many college students wear Western clothes. In the future, they should all be changed to uniforms and strive for simplicity. A small number of students smoke, and the school authorities should strictly ban them. (3) There are more than 30,000 shanty towns in the four suburbs near Shanghai. Due to the limited financial resources of the municipal government, it is impossible to rebuild all of them into affordable housing. There are quite a few wealthy people in the city who are not lacking in compassion. They should be motivated to donate money and transform the shanty towns, so that hundreds of thousands of poor people who are exposed to the elements can have a place to live. Shanghai is a major commercial port in East Asia. If the shanty towns are not transformed, it will not only hinder the appearance but also endanger the lives and health of the poor and the public health of the society. (4) The daily life of the middle class and above is too extravagant. At a time when the countryside is collapsing and starving people are everywhere, we must practice thrift and promote domestic products. We express our sympathy for the indigenous cloth movement promoted by Mr. Shi Hengqing and Mr. Tai Shuangqiu. Guanzi said, 'The number of extravagant expenses cannot be used in a country with dangerous straits.' This sentence can be used as a motto for us. (5) The Youth Service Corps under the leadership of the New Life Movement Promotion Association is disciplined and energetic, and can be the basic team for promoting the New Life Movement. If it can be sustained, it will be very effective. In short, the New Life Movement has a major mission, and its purpose is to seek the revitalization of the nation. To improve the living habits of a group of people cannot be achieved in a month. We must adhere to the spirit of perseverance, persist to the end, and carry it through to the end. The most feared thing is to start with a bang and end with a whimper, perfunctory and negligent. Propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame are the 'spiritual national defense' of the nation, which is more important than material construction. Shanghai is a gathering place for talents from all over the country. Intellectuals should be mobilized to promote the New Life Movement and save the country and survive. This is a crucial moment. It is not allowed to stand by and do nothing. Empty talk is enough to mislead the country. The key is to practice what you preach. If Shanghai implements it effectively, it will not be difficult to apply it to the whole country. There have been very few labor disputes in Shanghai recently, and the society is stable, which shows that Mayor Wu is leading effectively, and it also shows the public-mindedness of the industrial and commercial groups. Qingyu would like to express his gratitude to the local authorities and the industrial and commercial groups on behalf of the general association."</p>
<p>Departed for Hangzhou Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>Xu Qingyu, Zhang Yuchong, Lin Xueyan, and Yu Zhongqi, the four members of the New Life Movement Association inspection tour group, arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the 17th of this month and began inspecting the New Life Movement in various parts of Shanghai the next day. By yesterday, it had been five days. Details of the inspection have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. The group was scheduled to inspect in Shanghai for five days. Leader Xu received a telegram from Chairman Huang of the Zhejiang Provincial Government yesterday, welcoming them. Therefore, the two railway bureaus specially prepared a car, and at 6:50 PM yesterday evening, they took the Shanghai-Zhejiang express train to Hangzhou. Those who saw them off at the station included the mayor and directors of various bureaus, as well as representatives from the municipal party headquarters, all staff members of the New Life Movement Association, representatives from various sectors, and directors of the two railway bureaus. The atmosphere at the North Station was tense for a while. When Mr. Xu was about to leave, he told a reporter from the Kuomintang News Agency, "We plan to inspect in Hangzhou for three days, then go to Ningbo for a brief memorial service. If there is time, we will inspect the area along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and then go to Fuzhou. However, I (Xu himself) received a telegram from the Wuchang headquarters, so whether I will go to Fuzhou has not been decided, but the three inspectors Zhang, Lin, and Yu will go according to the planned itinerary."</p>

<h3 id="e118">Hunan Province's Million-Dollar Loan: Contract to be Signed Today <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai to Lend an Additional 150,000 Yuan, Agricultural and Commercial Bank to Lend 180,000 Yuan; Contracts for Both Banks Signed Yesterday, with Dates Set for Payment</p>
<p>According to the Xinxin News Agency, the Hunan Provincial Construction Public Bond secured loan from the Shanghai banking community is generally complete as a result of continuous negotiations by Zhang Kailian, Director of the Department of Finance of Hunan Province, and Yu Jichuan, Director of the Department of Construction. In addition to the 1 million yuan borrowed by the Central, China, and Communications Banks, which is scheduled to be signed today, Shanghai will borrow an additional 150,000 yuan, and the Agricultural and Commercial Bank will borrow 180,000 yuan, both of which have been formally signed with dates set for payment. The following is a breakdown of the information learned by the Xinxin News Agency reporter:</p>
<p>Agreement Reached by Three Banks</p>
<p>After the 1 million yuan borrowed by the Central, China, and Communications Banks was agreed upon the previous day, a draft contract was negotiated at 1:00 PM yesterday in the office of the Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank. Those who attended included Xi Deyi from the Central Bank, Chen Muhua from China Bank, Zhang Peishen from the Communications Bank, Zhang Kailian from the Hunan Department of Finance, and Yu Jichuan from the Department of Construction. Mr. Yu read the drafted contract clause by clause, and the representatives of each bank revised it. By 2:15 PM, the draft contract was fully agreed upon and could have been signed on the same day. However, because the contract had to be approved by the board meeting of the Central Bank held at 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, it was specially postponed to today for signing. The contract stipulates that the payment will be made in three installments: (1) 500,000 yuan will be paid on the 31st of this month; (2) 250,000 yuan will be paid on April 15th; (3) 250,000 yuan will be paid on June 15th. The interest rate is 8%, and the loan will be repaid in two years.</p>
<p>Signing by Two Banks</p>
<p>Yesterday, according to Zhang and Yu, the two directors, told the Xinxin News Agency reporter that the Hunan Provincial Government believes that the three major highways in Hunan Province are related to the suppression of bandits and military transportation, but the road surface is wide and long, the project is huge, and a lot of money is needed. Now, it will use a public bond with a face value of 3 million yuan to borrow 180,000 yuan from the Agricultural and Commercial Bank. The bank is enthusiastic to help, so it has formally signed the contract and set the end of this month to start payment. This loan is entirely used for the construction of the Pingjiang to Tongcheng section of the Hunan-Hubei trunk line. The section is more than 100 li long and has already started construction. It is limited to be completed and opened to traffic within three months. In addition, the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank independently borrowed 150,000 yuan, and officially signed a loan contract in the bank’s second floor at 3:00 pm yesterday. The public bond with a face value of 250,000 was mortgaged at 60% discount, and the money was paid in two installments: the first installment of 100,000 yuan was paid at the end of April this year, and the second installment of 50,000 yuan was paid at the end of June. The interest rate is 8%, and the loan is used to build the Hunan-Guizhou Highway.</p>
<p>Scheduled to Go to Hankou</p>
<p>The province's planned program was originally intended to borrow more than 2 million yuan to cope with the situation, and 1.33 million yuan has been successfully borrowed. It has not yet reached the original amount. It is now decided to continue to mortgage 800,000 yuan to the Jin Cheng, Ju Xing Cheng, China Agricultural and Industrial, China Industrial, and Continental banks. After continuous negotiations in Shanghai, each bank has agreed to help. However, the head offices of the above banks are all in the Hankou area, so Zhang and Yu, the two directors, are scheduled to leave Shanghai for Nanjing on the 25th to liaise with the Economic Committee, and then proceed from Nanjing to Hankou to continue negotiations. Once completed, they will return to Hunan to report.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Borrowing Contract Signed Yesterday Afternoon by Wuxi-Shanghai Road Motor Company <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Station Engineering Along the Way Is Under Preparation</p>
<p>The Wuxi-Shanghai Road Long-Distance Motor Company, in order to prepare for the opening of the road, has already raised 600,000 yuan in share capital, and borrowed 700,000 yuan from the banking group. After repeated negotiations between Wang Xiaolai, general manager of the company, Xu Peihuang, director, and Guo Bingwen, representative of the banking group, a draft loan contract was formed. With the consent of the banks participating in the loan, the contract was formally signed yesterday afternoon at the Bank Club. Those who attended included Wang Xiaolai, general manager of the company, Zhu Kaizhou, manager, Guo Bingwen, representative of the banking group, Cheng Muhua, representative of the Bank of China, Chen Mudian, representative of the Bank of Communications, Yang Jemei, representative of the Shanghai Bank, Shi Boqun, representative of the Four Banks Joint Savings Society, Zhang Zhuyu, representative of the China National Goods Bank, Yan Xifan, representative of the Jiangsu Bank, Bao Yingfu, representative of the Shanghai City Bank, Zhang Jianong, representative of the Shanghai Women's Commercial Savings Bank, and Gao Dajing, representative of the Shanghai Trust Company. It is reported that the vehicles needed for the road have been ordered and are being installed with chassis. The stations along the road and all engineering work are being actively carried out.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Four Exchanges Submit Request to the Ministry of Finance Again: Please Postpone the Transaction Tax <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Various Industries Are Currently in Decline and Cannot Afford It; Permission Granted to Postpone the Tax Until Business Conditions Improve in the Future</p>
<p>The five exchanges in Shanghai, due to the Ministry of Finance's scheduled collection of transaction taxes, collectively appealed to the central authorities, requesting a postponement. Later, the central government, considering that the Securities Exchange was purely an agency for trading national bonds, allowed it to be exempt from taxation within a possible scope. However, the remaining exchanges were not immediately accommodated. It is now reported that Du Yuesheng of the Gold Exchange, Mu Ouchu of the Cotton Cloth Exchange, Wang Yiting of the Flour Exchange, and Gu Xinyi of the Grains Exchange, the chairmen of the four exchanges, jointly submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance for permission to postpone the tax. The original text is as follows: (Titles omitted) "We have examined the Transaction Tax Regulations, which were approved by the fourth meeting of the Legislative Yuan on February 8. This time, we are extremely grateful to the Ministry for understanding our difficulties and for being exceptionally accommodating in reducing the tax rates. However, since the opening of the market, the cotton cloth industry has not only continued the depression of last year, but has also become even more severe. Furthermore, due to the dumping of Japanese cotton mills in China, the business of Chinese cotton mills is deteriorating. Recently, the incident of Shenxin Factory No. 7 is sufficient to prove this point. It is difficult to predict the number of other factories that will follow Shenxin's footsteps. In the gold industry, business is sluggish due to the depression in the market and the decline in finance. We can only maintain the status quo. In flour, due to the dumping of foreign flour and the shrinkage of the domestic market (after the occupation of the four northeastern provinces, the domestic market has disappeared by more than half), sales are sluggish and business is greatly burdened. Although miscellaneous grains are a necessity for the lives of people across the country, the bankruptcy of rural areas and the recurrence of disasters, coupled with the competition from foreign grains, have made the plight of grain merchants even more precarious. Considering the situation of the above industries, we have repeatedly thought about it and have no choice but to reiterate our previous request for a postponement to save the current economic crisis. Moreover, a transaction tax was once announced in 1927, but it was not implemented due to our request at the time. The situation of the business community today is far worse than it was then. Furthermore, since Japan unilaterally advocated Sino-Japanese economic cooperation recently, Japan has been actively plotting activities in our economic circles, which is very aggressive. It is possible that the Japanese exchange will revive at any time. In order to maintain the sluggish business situation, it is necessary to postpone the transaction tax. Once the business situation improves in the future, the tax can be levied again, so that both the government and the business community can benefit. We humbly request that our request be granted, which would be a great kindness."</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, the pre-exhibition of the London Exhibition of Chinese Art has been largely completed after the work of review and selection has been accelerated due to the approaching opening date. The reporter of the Central News Agency met with Guo Lianfeng, a member of the association, yesterday and learned that the display of porcelain has started today (i.e., yesterday). The catalog of antiquities is still waiting to be resolved at the preparatory committee meeting to be convened in Nanjing on the 30th of this month before it can be printed. As for the opening date, it was previously hoped that it could be at the end of the month or April 1st, but it is now feared that it will be too late, or the exhibition period will be extended to April 6th. After the display here is completed, it is planned to invite important people to attend the meeting for an inspection, so that if there are any improvements that need to be made, they can be followed.</p>

<h3 id="e123">Revival of the Sichuan River Shipping Industry After Years of Failure <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Financial Stability and Falling Exchange Rates; Plenty of Goods and Many Passengers, Each Increasing the Number of Runs; China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Is Discussing Adding Voyages</p>
<p>The Sichuan River shipping industry has been in decline for a long time. This time, after the Central Army entered Sichuan and defeated the Communists, commerce suddenly became prosperous and finance became stable, breaking the gloomy and dull atmosphere of the past few years. The recent report is as follows:</p>
<p>Smooth Financing</p>
<p>Last year, Sichuan merchants stopped handling goods because the Shanghai exchange rate rose to 1,700 yuan. The price of goods from Shanghai more than doubled. In addition, the interior of Sichuan was unstable, so various groups stopped shipping goods one after another, and the shipping industry suffered losses accordingly. Recently, the Central Government transported silver to Chongqing, the finance was liquid, and the exchange rate was flat. At present, it only costs 1,040 yuan to exchange one thousand Shanghai silver dollars in Sichuan. Therefore, various Sichuan merchants have recently telegraphed Shanghai, ordering the Shanghai dealers to handle the transportation of goods to Sichuan.</p>
<p>Crowding with Cargo, Increase in Voyages</p>
<p>The Communists who had been entrenched in Sichuan for many years have been defeated by the Central Army and the Sichuan Army. The bandit areas have been recovered one after another, and the requisitioned ships have been returned one after another. The water level of the Sichuan River has risen again, and Jianglun ships with a draft of eight or nine feet can pass through. Minsheng, Jiejang, Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, and Sanbei have each increased the number of voyages of ships to Sichuan and Shanghai. The number of goods transported has increased greatly, and foreign groceries and cotton yarn are already being packed.</p>
<p>Great Increase in Passengers</p>
<p>Since Chairman Chiang arrived in Chongqing, the number of passengers traveling back and forth along the Sichuan River has doubled, which is many times more than in the past. As a result, demand exceeds supply. The passenger ticket income of the Sichuan River ships of Minsheng, Jiejang, and Sanbei has increased greatly, which is rare in the past 20 years of Sichuan River ships, breaking the previous record.</p>
<p>China Merchants Resumes Navigation</p>
<p>The Sichuan River ships of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company have not been sailing since the Emei ship accident. The Emei ship has not yet been repaired. There is only one Kuaidi ship in the Hanyi line. Last year, the total water foot was only more than 18,000 yuan (on the Upper River line), which is less than one-eighth of that of Taikoo and Jardine Matheson. Now is a good opportunity to revive the ships on the Upper River. The Yichang and Chongqing branches have telegraphed the Shanghai headquarters, requesting that Sichuan River ships be dispatched quickly to supplement the Emei class, so as not to sit idly by and abandon huge profits and lose good opportunities. Manager Liu Hongsheng is discussing adding voyages and resuming navigation on the Sichuan River.</p>

<p>All Paid at 60% or 70% Discount; the Rent Reduction Association Commends</p>
<p>Due to the economic downturn and business depression in Shanghai, all tenants in the city are unable to bear the burden of rent. Therefore, there was a great rent reduction movement last year. Recently, the Shanghai Rent Reduction Committee reported that the members of the Jiangwan District Association live in houses owned by 75 landlords, all of whom have reduced rents by 60% or 70%. The first branch of the district also requested 30 landlords to reduce rents, so a meeting of both parties was convened at the Jiangwan District Association the day before yesterday. As a result, the rent reduction was calculated at a 70% discount, so the rent reduction for each tenant was satisfactorily resolved. They have successively withdrawn the deposited rent money from the bank and paid the rent at a 70% discount. The Rent Reduction Association believes that the District Association has worked hard and should be commended.</p>

Looking at Song Park, we shed tears together. Today is the day of the new and old calendars of Mr. Dun's birthday and death anniversary. I sincerely hope that this opportunity can be used to sweep the tomb with him. Because of things that cannot be done, how sad! Please prepare incense and flowers for me and announce my name."</p>

<p>The China Aviation Association and the Shanghai Municipal Fundraising Team Headquarters have recently received reports of achievements from various fundraising team leaders, showing great enthusiasm.

She also convened a meeting of the Defense Corps and others the day before, resolving that all officers and members would join the China Aviation Association as members. The team leaders of the Defense Corps will serve as deputy team leaders, and the members will solicit memberships from local businesses and encourage donations for aviation to save the country. The headquarters received a letter from her yesterday requesting the appointment of Zhu Shengyang, Wang Zhuangfei, Chen Baiyuan, Zeng Yu, Xiang Xianggao, Zhang Longhai, Gu Juru, Gao Ziyun, Xu Derun, Liu Hongxin, Zhou Chengxiang, and Pan Pinjian, among others, as deputy team leaders, and Chuan Depei, Wu Jian, Yang Jiansheng, Xiao Qixin, Feng Yifei, and Chong Muqing, among others, as team members.

<h3 id="e129">Treasury Department Public Debt Division Absolutely Denies Restructuring of the 96 Bonds <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Because These Bonds Have No Collateral</p>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, recently, rumors have suddenly spread in the city that the financial authorities will begin to restructure the 96 public bonds. The rumors were very specific, causing public anxiety. A reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency drove to visit Jiang Lufu, Director of the Public Debt Division of the Treasury Department, yesterday afternoon to inquire about the matter. He was received and stated that this statement was completely a rumor spread by speculators and was absolutely untrue. Furthermore, these 96 public bonds were issued by the Northern Government and have no collateral at all. Moreover, given the current state of the national treasury, which is experiencing financial difficulties, there are many bonds that need to be restructured, so how could they talk about restructuring the 96 bonds? This matter is very clear. Several years ago, the people of North China twice requested the authorities to restructure the bonds, but the authorities refused each time because the bonds had absolutely no collateral. The matter has been delayed until now.</p>

<p>Yang Peizhang, Jiang Juwu, and Wu Changkai, Chinese detectives of the New Bridge Police Station, and Bao Tai, a Western detective sergeant, successively cracked down on a case of counterfeiting in their jurisdiction the night before. The suspects, Chen Zhangrong, Wu Zhenxiang, Chen Wangshi, Zhang Wangshi, Shen Qianshi, and Shen Qinglin, were arrested. 1,220 counterfeit twenty-cent coins and counterfeiting equipment were confiscated and taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Judge Liu Yugui presided over the interrogation. The police station charged them with the crime of counterfeiting under Article 211, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, then rose and detailed the circumstances of the case, stating that since the police station learned that the defendants were counterfeiting coins and mixing them into circulation, they had requested the court to issue a search warrant. At 6:05 PM yesterday, they first searched No. 5 Lao Street on New Bridge Road, where they arrested Chen Rongzhang, his wife Chen Wangshi, and Wu Zhenxiang. 127 counterfeit twenty-cent coins were confiscated, as well as 31 more found in their shoes, and two stamps with the characters "Ming" and "Shun." They then went to No. 189 Dong Siwen Lane, No. 568 New Bridge Road, where they arrested the woman Zhang Wangshi and confiscated 10 counterfeit twenty-cent coins. Subsequently, based on Wu Zhenxiang's confession that the counterfeiting workshop was located at No. 969 North Chengdu Road, the Chinese and Western detectives went there and arrested Shen Qianshi and Shen Qinglin. They confiscated 14 sets of manufacturing molds, a bottle of soldering acid, four dry batteries, and chemicals. They also found 1,052 counterfeit twenty-cent coins in a wooden box on the drying platform. All of these items were brought back to the police station. It was discovered that the counterfeiting workshop on North Chengdu Road was run by Shen Peisheng, who was at large. Shen is the husband of the defendant Shen Qianshi and hired Shen Qinglin as an assistant. They started working in January of this year and have produced a total of 2,500 coins so far. Their method of manufacturing involves first making a plaster mold of a genuine twenty-cent coin, then placing lead into the mold and pressing it into the shape of a twenty-cent coin. They then use chemicals and dry batteries to put the genuine silver coins and lead coins together, transferring the silver from the silver coins onto the lead coins. Wu Zhenxiang acted as an intermediary, selling the counterfeit coins to Chen Zhangrong for 8 yuan per 200 coins, and he sold them three times. Chen then added the Ming and Shun stamps and tried to use them in various small vegetable markets. Wu profited by receiving 10 cents each day. However, when police detectives went to the workshop on North Chengdu Road to arrest Shen Peisheng, Shen heard the alarm, hid the counterfeit coins in a wooden box on the drying platform, climbed onto the roof, and escaped, avoiding arrest. In addition, they confiscated opium smoking paraphernalia in all three locations and requested a ruling from the court. The confiscated items were then presented to the court. After Judge Liu interrogated the defendants, he ordered them to be remanded in custody because the case required further investigation and scheduled a hearing in seven days.</p>

<p>The Girl's Father, Liu Hongcai, Angered, Reported to the Police Station Who Escorted Him to Court Yesterday Morning to File a Public Prosecution</p>
<p>Zhu Si, a native of Jiangbei, is 31 years old and works as a vendor. His brother, Zhu Wenfu, lives with Liu Hongcai, a watchman at the Zhangjiazhai Garden on Moore Road. Therefore, Zhu Si would bring his goods to his brother's residence to store them after work every day. Over time, he became acquainted with Liu. Liu has a daughter named Xiaolianzi, who is eight years old. Zhu Si had long harbored improper thoughts about her but had no opportunity to achieve his goals. One evening, Zhu Si brought his goods to his brother's place as usual. Zhu Wenfu and Liu Hongcai were both out, and only Xiaolianzi was home alone. Zhu Si thought this was an opportunity not to be missed. He enticed the girl to a corner of the room with sweet words, deceived her because of her young age, forcibly removed her pants, and committed rape. After satisfying his beastly desires, he threatened her to keep quiet. However, this budding flower could not withstand his destruction. Her lower body was injured, and her urethra was blocked. She felt increasingly unbearable pain at night and had to cry and tell her father. Liu Hongcai was furious when he heard this and immediately reported it to the Chengdu Road Police Station. Detective Feng Baishun and Detective Huang Fussen rushed to investigate and arrested Zhu Si. Xiaolianzi was sent to the hospital and examined by a doctor, who confirmed that she had been raped. Yesterday morning, the detectives escorted Zhu Si to the First Special District Local Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, filed a public prosecution, asking that the defendant be punished under Article 240, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code. He also gave a detailed account of the incident. Judge Liu announced that the hearing was closed to the public because the case involved moral corruption. After questioning the victim and the defendant, he ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and Xiaolianzi to be sent for a forensic examination and scheduled another hearing.</p>

<p>The girl Xu Gendi, 18 years old, originally from Tianjin, lost her parents at a young age. From the age of three, she was raised by her maternal grandparents, Xia Bingqing and Xia Geshi. The Xias currently live at the intersection of Huasheng Road and Datong Road in Zhabei, where they run a pawnshop. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 27th day of the tenth month of the Lunar calendar last year, at 10:00 AM, Gendi suddenly disappeared, and more than 30 yuan in silver, a gold bracelet, a gold ring, a men's and women's leather coat, a lotus-colored cotton cheongsam, and eight bolts of crepe satin for wrapping were taken away. After the incident, the Xias searched everywhere and requested the Xinzha Public Security Bureau of the Shanghai Local Court to assist in the arrest and record the case. It was not until the evening of the day before yesterday that Xia Ziruwei discovered that Gendi was being hidden in the pavilion room on the upper floor of a clothing store on Avenue Foch in the concession. He immediately went to the address and found Gendi. Her husband, Li Zhong, was also arrested, and Zhong pointed out that the matchmaker was Huang Yimin, who lived at No. 32 Taixingfang, Baotong Road, Zhabei, and worked as a weaver. So they went to Taixingli and arrested Huang's wife, Tang. Huang Tangshi further stated that it was Lu Akun from No. 17 Hongqingli, Yaojia Stone Bridge, who had abducted her and entrusted her husband, Huang Yimin, to be a matchmaker. They then found Lu Akun and brought him to police officers Chi Baoren and He Yongxiang at posts No. 11 and 12. The four men and women were taken to the Xinzha Branch. After questioning by bureau officer Zheng Zuhan, the plaintiff, Xia Ruruwei, stated that he was 27 years old, originally from Huai'an, and his statement was the same as above. Xu Gendi then stated that after being abducted by Lu Akun, she was first taken to Room 310 of the New Hotel on Er Ma Road, where she stayed for more than ten days. After raping her, he took all the money and belongings she had brought and sold her to a certain Jia, who worked in a factory on Jiyang Bridge. Later, Akun asked me to come out again and sold me behind the Star Company on Pike Road, but I do not know their names. The third time, he sold me to a brothel near the Great World, but I refused, so it was not successful. On the 13th day of the eleventh month, he sold me to Li Zhong's house on Zhongxing Road. At that time, Li paid 80 yuan. A monk named Huang pretended to be my father, and he (pointing to the monk) received the money. Li Zhong stated that he was 25 years old, from Ningbo, lived at No. 11 Fuxingli, Zhongxing Road, and worked as a cigarette salesman. Later, I heard that Lu Akun was going to ask Gendi to run away or would kill Gendi with a gun, so I moved to Avenue Foch. I married Gendi with Huang Tangshi as the matchmaker, and there was a written document. Lu Akun was also present. Huang Tangshi stated that she was 20 years old, from Changzhou. Xu Gendi was married to Li Zhong with my husband Huang Yimin as the matchmaker, but my husband is not at home, so they dragged me here. Lu Akun stated that he was 32 years old, from Zhejiang, and worked as a coppersmith, but his other statements were evasive. After the interrogating officer verified the statements, he determined that the case was criminal and that the branch bureau was not in a position to handle it, so he ordered that it be sent to the Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>At around 9:00 AM the day before yesterday, a man in ragged clothes was seen on a vacant lot beside Kaixuan Road in Shanghai West, breaking open a brand-new small coffin, taking out the body, stripping off the clothes it was wearing, and splitting open the coffin to tie it up. Just as he was about to carry it away, he was spotted by a watchman at the nearby sentry post, who stepped forward to arrest him and brought him back to the Caojiadu Branch. After questioning by bureau officer Xing, the man identified himself as Jiang Youhua, a 40-year-old from Anhui, and admitted to stealing the coffin. He was immediately documented and sent to the general bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>In December of last year, police officer Gu Luyan of the Sanguantang Police Station of the Ximen Branch was on guard duty in the Lujiabang area when he was suddenly attacked by a group of rioters at night. They rushed forward and robbed Officer Gu of his pistol. Officer Gu resisted and was stabbed in the left thumb by the rioters. Afterwards, Gu Liancheng, the squad leader of the detective team, along with team leaders Hu Kuishi and detectives Shen Jinchu, Zhao Jinquan, and Lu Cai, arrested the two criminals, Ding Huanzhang (aka Ding Xiaomazi) and Yang Defu. Four training dummies, two bloodstained axes, and iron rulers were found in Ding's residence. They were taken to the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau. Ding and the others confessed that a certain owner on Daling Road had hired workers to demolish a house, and they had gone to demand expenses. The police station found out about it and came to interfere and prohibit them. Therefore, they held a grudge and committed this malicious act, injuring the officer. However, they denied that they had stolen the officer's pistol. They were ordered to be transferred to the local court for trial. Prosecutor Lei Binzhang interrogated them, but the two criminals made many cunning statements and were ordered to be detained separately. Yesterday afternoon, the original investigators from the detective team were summoned to court to give a detailed account of the case. The interrogating officer again brought in the detained Ding Huanzhang and Yang Defu for questioning. The officers were ordered to return to their posts, and the two defendants were ordered to be remanded in custody pending further instructions.</p>

<p>The Shanghai West Caojiadu Shanghai West Cleanliness Office sent people to pick up night soil in Qujian last Sunday. After being opposed and rejected by the villagers, unexpectedly, at about 2:00 PM yesterday, a Wang Xueqin from Funing, holding a piece of old and discarded letter of commission from the High Court, went to the villagers Zhang Rusheng, Zhang Yinghua, and Liu Longyuan and falsely claimed that he was an investigator sent by the court. He demanded two yuan from them and instructed Zhang and others that they could refuse the Cleanliness Office in the future because the court would protect them. Later, he went to the home of Yao Xinwei, the representative of the Cleanliness Office at No. 43 Fuyuanli, Robison Road, in an attempt to intimidate and extort money from Yao. Unexpectedly, Yao saw through his trick. Because Wang dared to impersonate a court official, he took the liberty to extort money and disrupt the business of the Cleanliness Office. He immediately called the police, who arrested him and sent him to the Caojiadu Branch. Zhang Rusheng and others were summoned to testify. After Liu, the bureau officer, questioned them separately, he confirmed that it was true. Because the case involved a person impersonating a court official and designing to extort money, he immediately documented it and sent it to the general bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>Ding Chengfu Expresses Determined Refusal to Consent; Mediation Fails, Formal Lawsuit to Be Filed Separately</p>
<p>Hua Zhongchu, a trainee at the Henan Road branch of the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank, along with Ding Chengfu, Pan Ruilin, Zhu Minggui, and others, were found to have collectively replaced 30,000 yuan of banknotes with blank paper and exchanged 12,305 yuan of ten-yuan notes for five-yuan notes. After the case was uncovered, the First Special District Court successively detained and interrogated them, handing down judgments of imprisonment. It is learned that Ding Chengfu is a local, residing at the Ding Family Residence in Bailianjing, Pudong. Years ago, upon his parents' instruction and through a matchmaker, he formally engaged a Miss Lu Lianying, who lived nearby, as his wife. They chose February 23rd of this year for the wedding. Both families made thorough preparations, purchasing all necessary items, filled with joy and excitement, preparing to slaughter pigs and sheep for a grand feast for guests. Unexpectedly, good fortune often meets with obstacles. The discovery of the theft of a large sum of money was like a bolt from the blue, completely spoiling the festive mood. Just ten days before the auspicious date (February 14th), Ding Chengfu was arrested and imprisoned, experiencing the "flavor" of iron bars. The result of the trial was that Ding was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment, to be served at the Tilanqiao Western Prison. After this case occurred, newspapers widely reported it, and the bride's family was quite distressed. Now, Ding Chengfu's unmarried fiancée, Lu Lianying, argues that the defendant was arrested for embezzling a large sum of money, his character has fallen, and he is despicable. She believes that the evil society, through what one sees and hears, has led to today's outcome. Marriage is a lifelong commitment and cannot be treated as child's play. Moreover, the defendant is so rogue-like, and the future is unimaginable. Therefore, she has engaged lawyer Yu Jiazhen to file a petition with the Local Court's Mediation Chamber to dissolve the engagement and to recover prior losses amounting to 600 yuan in silver dollars. Yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m., Judge Wang Run specially opened the Second Court for the hearing. The petitioner, Lu Lianying, did not appear, but was represented by lawyer Yu, who stated that the petitioner is 21 years old, a Shanghai native, and has been engaged to the defendant for many years. Now, because the defendant has engaged in this dishonorable act, it is impossible to marry him. The fault lies with the other party, so the petitioner seeks to dissolve the engagement and demands that the other party compensate her for the 600 yuan in losses incurred. The defendant, Ding Chengfu, was brought in for questioning and stated that he is 23 years old, a local, graduated from higher primary school, and entered the Agricultural and Industrial Bank as a banknote clerk, where he has served for many years. This time, he was implicated by his colleagues and sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment. The judge asked if she disliked him for having legal troubles and did not want to marry him, and if he had any statement to make. Ding replied that he absolutely could not agree to dissolve the engagement. As for the legal troubles, he was harmed by friends and begged for completion of the marriage. The judge said that since she was unwilling, he could not force her. Moreover, when his sentence expires and he restores his reputation, it would not be difficult to get engaged again. He replied that he firmly disagreed. The questioning judge concluded that mediation had failed and instructed the petitioner to file a formal lawsuit separately. Consequently, he ordered Ding Chengfu to be returned to custody, awaiting transfer back to the Western Prison to serve his sentence.</p>

<h3 id="e140">Sanxing Steamship Manager, Ma Guanlin, Defrauds Guarantee Deposits <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Ma Surrounded by Victims in Hotel; Wife Notifies Police Upon Learning of Situation, and He Is Sent to Court</p>
<p>Ma Guanlin, a native of Ningbo, currently residing at No. 63 Guoqing Road, Zhabei, is 35 years old. In the early winter of last year, he and his friend Ge Xiangfu, among others, jointly established the Sanxing Steamship Company at the Dadao Wharf in Nanshi. Ge initially served as manager, and after chartering the Shunchang steamboat, he defrauded people of guarantee deposits for positions such as compradors and stewards. In November, after Ge was prosecuted and sentenced to imprisonment, Ma took over as manager and leased the Ningzhou steamboat from the Huxing Company, docking it at the southern end of the 16th Pier, advertising service on the Xiaochang River. He successively collected deposit money from Wang A'er, Wang Yongtang, Shi Mianchen, Peng Xicheng, Qin Mingsheng, Zheng Shanqing, and others for positions such as compradors, accountants, stewards, and cooks, ranging from 50 yuan to 700 yuan, totaling more than 1,600 yuan. However, after collecting the money, Ma repeatedly postponed the dates for the workers to board the ship and start their jobs. After nearly twenty days, Wang and the others realized that they would not be able to work on the ship and discovered Ma's fraudulent scheme. They demanded the return of the money they had paid, but Ma disappeared without a trace. At that time, Ma lived on Huanghe Road in the French Concession, but in fact, his entire family had moved to Zhabei. Finally, on the 13th of this month, Wang A'er and the others encountered Ma on the street and confronted him. Ma agreed to meet them at Room 27 of the Renhe Hotel at No. 114 Dongzilaihuo Street in the French Concession to discuss the matter, with Ma promising to find a guarantor and gradually resolve the issue. However, Ma delayed until the 21st without reaching a resolution, making it difficult for him to return home. Ma's wife, née Yu, realizing that her husband had been away for several days, inquired everywhere. On the evening of the 21st, she learned that her husband was trapped inside the Renhe Hotel. After consulting with lawyer Lan Renwei, she reported to the Dada Ziminzhong French police station that her husband, Ma Guanlin, was being illegally detained in the hotel by Wang A'er and others, infringing on his freedom. The police chief dispatched detective Liu Dianlong to investigate. He brought Ma and Wang, along with the others, to the police station. After questioning them one by one, Ma, seeing the situation was unfavorable, suddenly wanted to withdraw the charge of infringement of freedom. However, Wang A'er and the others, accusing Ma of defrauding guarantee deposits, committing a criminal offense, requested an investigation. The police detained Ma. Yesterday afternoon, he was sent to the Second Special District Court, where Judge Qiu Huan-ying presided over the Eighth Criminal Court for the hearing. The police lawyer, Yuan Jiahuang, presented the case and charged Ma under Article 363 of the Criminal Code. Detective Liu Dianlong then reported the circumstances of the defendant's arrest. Ma Guanlin confessed that only the money from Shi Mianchen and Peng Xicheng was received by him. The rest was collected by the former manager, transferred to him, and he issued new receipts in exchange for the old ones. The steamboat exists, but the Maritime Affairs Bureau has not yet finalized the route, so it cannot operate. Recently, the shareholders elected him as manager, and he also has shares in the Sanxing Company, but the plaintiffs' money has been used by others, and he has also been deceived and implicated. He originally agreed to settle with them. The plaintiffs then testified about their experiences of being defrauded, stating that all the guarantee deposits were handed over to Ma. The former manager, Ge Xiangfu, is also facing legal charges for fraud and is currently in prison. At this point, the judge instructed the defendant, stating that since he is a shareholder of the company, he should be responsible for repaying the money and cannot shirk responsibility. If he can settle the matter, the court will reschedule the hearing. He can present any other evidence at the next hearing. The judge also informed him that the hearing would be rescheduled for the 26th and ordered him to be returned to custody, fearing he might flee. The defendant's lawyer requested bail, but the court denied it. He then requested to be transferred to the detention center, which the court approved. The bailiffs then escorted the defendant to the detention center.</p>

<h3 id="e143">History of the Organization and Consolidation of China's Light Bulb Industry <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency visited Mr. Hu Xiyuan of the Ya Peier Electric Factory yesterday regarding the organization of China's Light Bulb Consolidation Company and inquired about the details. According to Mr. Hu, the initiation of China's Light Bulb Consolidation Company was in mid-November of last year. It was felt that various Chinese light bulb factories were acting independently in terms of business and manufacturing, with very little overall coordination. Therefore, the standards of products and methods of sales were not ideal. If manufacturers only seek short-term gains, producing shoddy goods and recklessly selling them on the market, it would damage the reputation of Chinese light bulbs as a whole. These weaknesses needed to be addressed, or else how could they compete with foreign light bulbs? Therefore, the motivation for organizing China's Light Bulb Consolidation Company was to develop strategies for trade against foreign goods. It was not for the benefit of one factory or for personal gain, but for the collective, not individual private interests. However, given that each factory has different capital and production, those who are restricted by the current environment and genuinely cannot participate will not be forced to agree. This plan is still actively underway. The members are determined to sacrifice their rights to promote its early realization.</p>

<h3 id="e145">Various Organizations Follow Mayor Wu's Wishes, Postponing Discussion of Building a Merit Pavilion; Fundraising for Chiang Kai-shek Statue Continues with Enthusiastic Participation from Organizations <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that various circles in this city, in order to express their admiration for the achievements of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Mayor Wu, have launched a campaign to erect a bronze statue and build a pavilion to commemorate them. The participation has been extremely enthusiastic. Yesterday, Tongji University, the Chinese Vocational Education Society, the Duck Butchery Trade Association, and the Postal Workers Union, among others, joined the campaign. However, because Mayor Wu repeatedly declined, the association sent a letter to Mayor Wu, stating that, in response, upon receiving your letter, we were greatly moved. This time, various circles in the city, because of the Mayor's three years in office, shouldering great burdens, working hard to restore public order after the tragic Shanghai Incident, vigorously promoting construction, and striving to realize Premier Sun Yat-sen's Greater Shanghai Plan, with both civil and military achievements, are all worthy of admiration. After much collective support, it was specially launched to build a pavilion to leave a memorial. But the Mayor does not claim credit for his achievements and declines repeatedly, only causing the citizens to reminisce about the wind and want to proceed but cannot. Now, in order to respect your Excellency's wishes, we are forced to temporarily postpone the building of the pavilion memorial and concentrate on the construction of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's statue. This has been reported to the municipal government and notified to all participating organizations. Currently, this office is still actively working on the statue preparations, continuing to solicit participation from all circles to show solemnity. We are grateful for your support and hope for your guidance to facilitate progress. The Statue Construction Association plans to convene a meeting of the initiators and establish a preparatory committee after the number of initiating organizations reaches one hundred.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Shanghai Municipal Council's Financial Situation <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Surplus of 700,000 Taels Last Year; No Need to Increase Municipal Tax This Year</p>
<p>The Treasurer of the Shanghai Municipal Council reported to the Finance Committee that the budget for regular expenses last year, i.e., 1934, had a surplus of approximately 700,000 taels (previously it was predicted that there would only be a surplus of 40,000 taels). The various departments made great efforts to tighten their spending, resulting in total savings of approximately 1.1 million taels. However, tax revenues were also short by 430,000 taels, and the expenses of the Rickshaw Affairs Committee, 45,000 taels, were also not originally in the budget. But there was still a surplus as mentioned above.</p>
<p>As for the finances for this year, i.e., 1935, the regular expenses will require approximately 27.1 million taels, and the income is expected to be approximately 25.9 million taels, leaving a shortfall of approximately 1.2 million taels. The Treasurer stated that this would be paid from the general reserve fund. In this way, the municipal tax for this year can be exempted from increase.</p>
<p>Regarding the temporary budget, the bond issuance approved in the morning was not fully subscribed, and many of the land plots planned for sale were also not sold. Therefore, the year-end loss is expected to be 5.5 million taels, which will be included in the adjustments for this year. The construction costs for this year are lower than last year, mainly to complete projects that have already been started and unavoidable road work, along with debt repayment, as in the previous year.</p>
<p>The Treasurer stated that the current spending in all areas has been deferred to the extent possible. Once the financial situation in the city recovers to normal, the issuance of public bonds will be discussed again.</p>

<p>To the Editor: Having read the article in your newspaper on March 20th regarding the women's circles seeking peace, I yesterday telegraphed the Women's Disarmament Conference in Geneva, "The Chinese Women's Movement Alliance, during its March 8th meeting this year, had a proposal put forward by Zhou Jingjue and others, representatives of the Women's Branch of the Peace Association, requesting that the world's women telegraph the authorities of various countries, advocating for peace." According to the general rules of meetings, non-members have no right to make proposals. The statement "a proposal put forward by Zhou Jingjue and others, representatives of the Women's Branch of the Peace Association" is clearly inconsistent with the facts. Deeply fearing misunderstanding from the outside world, I hereby send a special letter, requesting that you correct it on our behalf. Wishing you peace, The Chinese Women's Movement Alliance, March 21st.</p>
<p>To Whom It May Concern: We are instructed by the Yongyu Shipping Company to state that, upon reading a news item in today's Shen Bao regarding the Chongming County detaining the Dalian ship for smuggling opium, it was stated that in January of this year, the police of the Chongming County Public Security Bureau found 1,000 packages of opium smuggled from Shanghai to Chongming in the Dalian ship's accounts room, and the county fined the shipowner, and now the old matter is being brought up again, and the county government, upon provincial order, has detained the ship and arrested the accountant, etc. It is found that the Dalian ship of this company was previously, in January, due to passengers privately carrying opium, which was seized by the police in the ship's steerage, and the criminals fled, which has no relation whatsoever to the Dalian ship. The claims of finding it in the accounts room and the shipowner being fined are without basis in fact. As for this time, it was falsely accused by someone from the Provincial Opium Prohibition Association, claiming that on the 3rd of this month, the Dasu ship smuggled a large amount of opium to Chongming for sale. The province, without investigating, hastily ordered the county to detain the Dasu ship. In reality, there was no seizure of opium on the 3rd of this month. This company cannot bear this slander and has already telegraphed the province for a thorough investigation and requested that the ship be released first to facilitate navigation. As for the Shen Bao's claim that this detention is a rehash of an old matter from January of this year, it is even further from the truth. It should be requested that your lawyer promptly issue a correction to clarify the situation, etc., which is hereby conveyed on behalf of the company. We hope you will investigate and correct it. Respectfully, To the Editorial Department of the Shen Bao, Lawyer Sun Zuji, March 22nd.</p>

<p>(2) Trade: Foreign trade in Soviet Russia is managed and operated under government control, and since 1932, import and export trade has shown a sharp downward trend. In 1929, the average monthly import value was 73.39 million rubles; in 1931, the monthly average rose to 92.09 million rubles; but in 1932, the monthly average import value suddenly decreased to 58.67 million rubles; in 1933, it further decreased to 29.02 million rubles. The total import value from January to September 1934 was 171.12 million rubles, averaging 19.01 million rubles per month, but most of these were tools for industrial production. Due to the sharp decrease in import trade, export trade also decreased accordingly. In 1929, the average monthly export value was 76.97 million rubles; in 1930, it increased to 86.36 million rubles; in 1931, it began to decrease to 67.6 million rubles; in 1932, it was 47.91 million rubles; in 1933, it further decreased to 41.31 million rubles. The total export value from January to September of this year (1934) was 302.03 million rubles, with the average monthly export value further decreasing to 33.56 million rubles. However, the decrease in Soviet Russia's export trade was weaker than that of import trade. Therefore, from 1930 to 1932, it was originally a country with an import surplus, but in 1933, it reversed from an import surplus to an export surplus, with an export surplus of 147.45 million rubles. The export surplus from January to September of this year (1934) was already 130.91 million rubles. Although we cannot see the whole picture, it is enough to see a glimpse of Soviet Russia's trade this year. (To be continued)</p>

<p>The match between the Police Brigade and Donghua, originally scheduled for 6:30 PM tonight against the Beijing Mail Order team, has been changed to next Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Wuhan Police Brigade basketball team was originally scheduled to play against Donghua last night, but due to the incompleteness of the Donghua team members, they were unable to appear. Instead, the East Asia Physical Education College team competed against them. In the first game, the Police Brigade lost to Jinan due to unfamiliarity with the field. In last night's second battle, they washed away the previous panic and played with a combination of strength and gentleness, with great style and color. On the East Asia side, center Pan Chengbin was injured and did not arrive, reducing their strength slightly. The situation was one-sided. East Asia was under attack from all sides and at a loss. The Police Brigade marched forward with great momentum, as if entering an uninhabited land. As a result, the Police Brigade won by a large margin with a score of 53 to 18.</p>

<p>Re-election of Directors and Election of Officers: Welcoming Participation from the Literary and Art Circles</p>
<p>The Chinese branch of the World PEN has been established for many years. However, since the January 28th Incident, many of the old directors have been scattered, and the progress of the association's affairs has been largely stagnant. Therefore, the former directors convened a general meeting of all members last night at Room 338, No. 749 Jing'an Temple Road. More than 30 Chinese members attended, including Cai Yuanpei, Li Zhaohuan, Chuan Donghua, Lin Yutang, Quan Zenghua, Song Chunfang, Chuan Yanchang, Li Qingya, Dong Renjian, Zhao Jingshen, Zhang Ruogu, Zeng Xubai, and Shao Xunmei, as well as more than 10 foreign members, including Mrs. Fritz. At the meeting, Cai Yuanpei, Lin Yutang, Zeng Xubai, Song Chunfang, Mrs. Fritz, He Bocheng, Chuan Donghua, Li Zhaohuan, Li Qingya, Shao Xunmei, and Quan Zeng were re-elected as directors. Cai Yuanpei was elected as the president, Mrs. Fritz was elected as the English secretary, Hui Xu was elected as the Chinese secretary, and Song Chunhang was elected as the treasurer. Subsequently, it was resolved to use the remaining space of the International Barristers Association at No. 50 Nanjing Road as the address, and it was decided to strive to promote the association's affairs, widely invite members, and contact various out-of-town areas to establish branches to facilitate communication. The famous British playwright Noel Coward will be coming to China soon, and the association has decided to hold a banquet to welcome him, so that they can exchange opinions and discuss literary and artistic matters. According to reports, the PEN is a large group of literary and art workers from various countries, with the headquarters in London and branches all over the world. Its purpose is to connect literary and art workers from all over the world and communicate the culture between different nationalities. It has a long history and a grand scale. It is said that after the reorganization of the Chinese branch this time, participation from the literary and art circles is welcomed.</p>

<p>Scheduled for April 18th at the Municipal Government - Children's Day to be Prepared Separately by the Happiness Association - Education Bureau to Conduct Celebrations Separately in Schools Today</p>
<p>The Municipal Children's Happiness Association and the Student National Goods Year Movement Committee held a joint meeting at the Municipal Education Bureau yesterday at 10:00 AM to discuss matters related to celebrating Children's Day. Representatives from the Happiness Association, including Pan Gongzhan (Hu Dai), Hu Shuyi, Li Ting'an, and Qian Fugong, and representatives from the Student National Goods Year Association, including Yang Jiaoqi, Zhu Changli, Cao Zhigong, and Ni Baiyan, attended. The originally planned celebration methods have been changed.</p>
<p>Postponement of Swearing-in Ceremony The Student National Goods Year Committee originally planned to hold the swearing-in ceremony at the Municipal Government on April 4th. However, since April 4th falls during the spring break period, it would be inconvenient for students from various schools to return to their hometowns to participate in the ceremony. Therefore, as April 18th is the anniversary of the founding of the capital in Nanjing, it was decided to reschedule the swearing-in ceremony to April 18th and hold it at the Municipal Government.</p>
<p>Separate Celebrations The Children's Happiness Association originally intended to hold the Children's Day celebration jointly with the Student National Goods Year. However, since the association has rescheduled, it was decided to prepare independently. At the same time, as a large-scale opening ceremony for the Children's Year will be held on August 1st of this year, the current Children's Day will not be expanded to save money. Eight activity items for elementary schools during the current Children's Day have been drafted and submitted to the Municipal Education Bureau for implementation in schools. The list is as follows: (1) Schools will hold separate celebration ceremonies; (2) Publish special issues of Children's Day; (3) Hold swearing-in ceremonies for good children; (4) Hold recreational gatherings; (5) Hold toy exhibitions; (6) Hold achievement exhibitions; (7) Hold health competitions; (8) Decorate the celebration environment. In addition, a recreational gathering and children's broadcasting session will be held at the Public Education Center on that day. The Shipping Radio Station will broadcast children's programs from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM, with speeches by celebrities invited by the Children's Happiness Association.</p>

<p>The International Problems Research Association and the International Trade Association held a joint lecture meeting at the Bank Club the day before yesterday (the 20th), inviting Chen Heqin, Director of the Chinese Education Department of the Public Concession, to speak on "Impressions of a European Tour." Dozens of people, including Liu Zhanen, Huang Renzhi, Guo Bingwen, Li Zhaohuan, Chen Liting, Shen Xinqing, Cheng Haifeng, Zhang Xianglin, Xu Peihuang, and Chen Lingyi, attended. Liu Zhanen chaired the meeting. Mr. Chen spoke for an hour. The main points are summarized as follows: Heqin's trip to Europe to study education lasted seven months. Excluding the time spent on the ship, the actual investigation work was only five months. During these five months, he visited a total of eleven countries. The education in these eleven countries has its own characteristics. However, observing the education of many countries in a short period of time is inevitably a superficial experience. Here, I will focus on the more detailed observations of England and Russia.</p>
<p>England</p>
<p>(1) General Education: Since 1928, England has greatly reformed education. The curriculum and system have been transformed to meet modern needs. Children who are five years old must enter kindergarten, and at the age of seven, they enter primary school. From the ages of five to eleven, there are six years. After graduating from primary school, there are four avenues for further education after a rigorous examination: 1. Middle school; 2. Junior vocational school; 3. Central school; 4. Senior primary school. English middle schools still require tuition, but 20% of the places are free, reserved for poor but academically outstanding students. Middle schools are specifically for preparing for higher education. Those who are preparing for employment enter junior vocational schools after graduating from primary school. Those who are not preparing for higher education but wish to gain a slightly higher level of knowledge than primary school or to fulfill their compulsory education years enter central schools or senior primary schools. (2) Special Education: In addition to ordinary primary schools and kindergartens, special schools such as schools for the blind, deaf, and disabled are established in various cities. For children with intellectual disabilities, there are schools for children with intellectual disabilities to implement various special training programs. For children with lung diseases, there are also open-air classrooms for classes and recuperation. In short, all children in England, whether they are intelligent or foolish, healthy or disabled, have the opportunity to receive education. (3) Curriculum: In terms of curriculum, two aspects of English education are worth noting: A. Physical Education: Physical education is the most important aspect in the current English education system. The so-called "education of a gentlemanly demeanor" is mainly due to physical education. All primary and secondary schools pay attention to physical training. Various sports buildings and equipment are very common. In addition to public sports fields built by the government, each school has a gym. In Liverpool alone, there are more than ten privately built swimming pools that are open to the public, and each primary and secondary school also has a public swimming pool for students to practice. Swimming is a compulsory subject. Teachers lead students to swim on time every two weeks, regardless of wind, rain, cold, or heat. In the past, when teaching freehand exercises, students felt bored because they were done continuously from beginning to end of each class. Now, a mixed system has been adopted, in which exercises and games are taught alternately. For example, after ten minutes of exercise, a game is played, and then exercise is continued. As a result, students are very interested in exercise, and the efficiency of physical education classes has greatly increased. The physical condition of English children is exceptionally healthy. Looking back at Chinese children, we feel ashamed. B. Labor: The labor teaching materials in schools focus on practical training. Boys focus on handicrafts such as woodworking and metalworking. Girls' extracurricular activities focus on home economics, such as sewing, cooking, and laundry, all under the guidance of teachers. Children make their own clothes, cook snacks, and other practical items needed in daily life. The required expenses are entirely borne by the students themselves. If students are willing to sell their works, the school buys them at a reasonable price. The purpose of this type of education is to develop students' production skills so that they can support themselves in the future. This is the characteristic of labor education in England, and we should learn from it.</p>
<p>Russia</p>
<p>(1) Popular Education: Among European countries, Russia is a unique country. Their education is unique. We know that at the beginning of the Soviet revolution, their education was more immature and rudimentary than ours. However, the speed of recent educational progress is truly astonishing. There are a total of 150 different ethnic groups in the Soviet Union, each with its own different language or script. The situation is complex, as you can imagine. However, the Soviet government has achieved the goal of universal education in just thirteen years. There are now no illiterate citizens in the country, and seventy ethnic groups originally had no written language. Now, each has its own newly created written language. The majority of the people across the country, regardless of gender or age, read newspapers and books. The speed of educational progress is evident. (2) Children's Education: There are many school-age children in the Soviet Union. There are too few schools in each city to accommodate them. Therefore, the half-day system is temporarily adopted. Students are divided into morning and afternoon classes and attend and are taught in turns. Therefore, the capacity of the school is doubled, and the effectiveness of education is greatly increased. (3) Practice and Production: Russian schools have scientific research institutes and art research institutes. The scientific research institutes are further divided into departments such as telephone, machinery, radio, applied chemistry, aircraft, and automobiles. Children aged 11 to 17 choose a group with similar characteristics and practice research under the guidance of teachers. During my visit, I saw two cars, one large and one small, which were said to have been built by the students themselves. In short, the education in European countries can be said to be closely integrated with society. It is not pure book learning, but practical and realistic, not just a formality. This is what we should pay special attention to.</p>

<h3 id="e181">Datong and Nian Er Sports Meet Jointly Organized - Huxi People's Livelihood Education Experimental Zone <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>The Datong University of this city previously jointly organized the Fanwangdu Popular Education Youth Experimental Zone with the Huxi Nian Er Society. Significant achievements have been made in improving local cloth and creating popular education vehicles. However, due to the mobile nature of the people in the area, the original plan was difficult to implement. Moreover, the school had previously established the Jinjia Lane Rural Nian Er Society to conduct people's livelihood-based education. Recently, as more and more people have come to visit and inquire about the methods, it is also necessary to expand the experiment. Therefore, it has joined forces with the Nian Er Sports Promotion Association to jointly organize the Huxi People's Livelihood Education Experimental Zone. The existing Jinjia Lane Rural Nian Er Society and the Huxi Nian Er Society will be reorganized and trialed, and it is planned to gradually add a number of Nian Er Societies. An economic group system will be adopted under each Nian Er Society to establish cooperative groups for washing, planting, pulling carts, and weaving to promote the foundation of education. It is said that dozens of kinds of group teaching materials have been compiled for future use.</p>
<h3 id="e182">National Conservatory of Music School Building Construction and Performance <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>The National Conservatory of Music received construction funds from the Ministry of Education this year and has purchased land on Shijing Road in the central district to start construction of the school building. However, it is said that the school received limited funding, so it cannot build dormitories at the same time. It is now seeking to raise funds to provide accommodation for students. Also, it is reported that Dai Cuilun, a violin student from the undergraduate program of the school, will graduate in June of this year and has scheduled a graduation concert at the New Asia Hotel Auditorium on Sichuan Road at 8:00 PM on the 26th of this month. Mr. Dai has won the first prize for his musicality several times at the school. His performance on stage is expected to be excellent. It is said that tickets have already been sold, with prices ranging from two yuan, one yuan, and five cents. All piano stores are selling them on consignment. It is said that the school affairs meeting has decided that all income, except for expenses, will be allocated to the school's construction costs.</p>

<p>Since Mr. Chen Zhaogang took over the Yaling Elementary School and Kindergarten at the intersection of Huanlong Road and Masnan Road in the French Concession this spring, he has strived to improve school affairs and training. The school building has also been refreshed. The teachers hired are all scholars and talents. The number of students enrolled this year has been increasing. Now, Chu Minyi, Yang Xiaotian, Chen Jicheng, Tong Hangbai, Wu Xiu, Zhang Gengshan, and Chen Songchun have been invited to serve as school directors. The first school board meeting was convened at the school yesterday, and Chu Minyi was elected as the chairman of the school board.</p>

<h3 id="e184">German Science and Chinese Libraries (Part 1) <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— By Dr. Jiejin, German Library Committee</p>
<p>Although the German scientific community and the Chinese academic community are separated by a great distance, the scientific ties between the two countries have not only been very close in recent years, but have also complemented each other. The number of Chinese youth studying in Germany is increasing year by year, and the number of German university professors lecturing at Chinese research institutions is also increasing year by year. German science has spread all over the world. In countries such as Turkey and South America, universities have been founded entirely in accordance with the German spirit and methods, and most of the professors hired by these universities are German. Chinese and German cultures have obvious similarities, and the starting point of pure scientific thought methods is completely the same. Based on this spirit, under close contact, the greatest effects can naturally continue to be harvested. China does not lack well-known figures who are proficient in German language, such as Zhu Jiahua, Minister of Transportation and former Minister of Education of the National Government, who was one of those who studied industry at German universities. This is a point that Germans are generally happy about. Germany has always strived for closer contact and has strived to fully utilize this contact in order to benefit both parties.</p>
<p>What is described in this article is not intended to describe the close contact between China and Germany in detail, but to simply explain a point that is easily overlooked by the general public. Although this point is not valued by people, it actually contains lasting and important significance. So, what is this? It is the relationship between German science and Chinese libraries. This article is based on the position of the German Academic Exchange Service.</p>
<p>The German Academic Exchange Service is the central organization for academic research in Germany. The Exchange Service's mission is to engage in scientific research and to establish relations with foreign countries in accordance with its regulations and will. Because it has already achieved good results in its own country, it will further establish a solid foundation for the Chinese knowledge community. It is necessary to thoroughly realize the ambition of making German libraries familiar with the Chinese situation, and in order to closely connect with the major Chinese libraries that pay attention to European literature and language, it has already received friendly responses from all parties in China in the process of mutual exchanges. China has a vast territory, and it is of course not within the scope of this article to describe the situation of contact in various aspects in detail. Therefore, what is described here is only a few of the most important institutions and the efforts made by the Exchange Service in this regard.</p>
<p>First of all, in Shanghai, at this time, 9,000 German books were donated by the Exchange Service and destroyed by Japanese soldiers. The Oriental Library, which is now being rebuilt, is receiving this batch of books, which have already been sent from Germany to China. In order to facilitate readers to enjoy the important books of the New Germany, this collection contains monographs on various aspects of the past and present struggles of the Germans. This kind of book is attached with magnificent myths and stories and has the latest factory building images. Another part describes German cooperative societies, which are the only well-equipped in Europe and are models for the whole of Europe. Many people come to Germany every year to visit this facility. This type of book also has illustrations. Even readers with a shallow level of German can easily get a glimpse of where the German spirit is and where the great German culture lies after opening the book. Another part is about German law. This type of book can be regarded as the standard of modern law books. As for other aspects, only representative works are collected. These works are all produced under the assistance of the Exchange Service, rare scientific experiments, and are collected for the convenience of Chinese experts. As for some older versions of the books, they are all donated by scientific tycoons and libraries. From this type of book, we can know that the Exchange Service also accepts both old and new books. It is hoped that readers will learn from the past and know the new. This is the purpose of including old books. There is also a part of German poetry. Chinese people who love poetry may be able to better understand the essence of Germany by reading this.</p>

<p>— (Yu Ming)</p>
<p>Washing off the rouge on the lips and cheeks of all the fashionable women in the country might turn the Yellow Sea into the Red Sea: scraping off the powder on their faces might be enough to paint a twenty-two-story building: taking off the high heels of their leather shoes and connecting them one by one might be higher than the pyramids.</p>
<p>"One must know contentment in life" This sentence is not very appropriate. If people are content, their thinking will not advance, how can there be present civilization? But it cannot be completely obliterated either. If everyone becomes discontent with money, what would happen!</p>
<p>"Adversity revitalizes the nation" This sentence has become a cliché of the Chinese people. Therefore, I hope that more national disasters will occur, so that the country can be revitalized. However, one must not resist national disasters, because once resisted, national disasters will be eliminated, and the country will have no hope of being revitalized.</p>
<p>Heaven and earth are a furnace, war is a fire, and humanity is a mineral. Whoever can withstand the tempering of the fire in the furnace without being eliminated is good iron.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Mid-Spring Season <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Qifenglou Master</p>
<p>The call for spring has reached the world, and people have been shouting for it for a long time. Spring is the most lovely season of the year, because everything about it gives people pleasure and love, which of course can win the warm welcome of the masses! However, spring is ninety days, and when it first slowly descends, it is the solemn and bleak late winter that has just passed. Although the earth is calling for the return of spring, the cold is still strong. Everyone is calling for the chilling spring cold, which is still a pity. By the time of late spring in March, the grass grows and the warblers fly, and it will leave without any reluctance, only increasing the infinite melancholy of those who grieve for spring! Perhaps some people are sighing the tune of "Spring returns, but people do not return." Only the mid-spring weather, the plants have progressed from the germination period to the lush era, and the green peaks and blue waves show a gentle and beautiful posture. Especially in the apricot blossom rain, the clothes are about to be wet, and in the willow breeze, the face is not cold. It is just like a charming young woman, smiling coyly. Ah! This beautiful nature really makes people intoxicated!</p>
<p>"A year's plan lies in spring" This is known to everyone, but how many people can work hard in the spring? Now spring is half gone. In the blink of an eye, the water flows, the flowers fall, and the spring is old. Where can you buy youth with gold! Although the god of spring is smiling gently at the masses, it is disciplined and knows to move forward bravely! Never hesitating for a moment! Perhaps it is a good teacher and helpful friend, patiently guiding people to move forward bravely on the right track, but people cannot understand its good intentions! They only know to take advantage of the gentle breeze and beautiful sun, and everyone is comfortably playing, and they are beautifully named "Enjoying the fun in time." Moreover, for the sake of meaningless things, they have abandoned the important mission of life and done the dead end of suicide and self-destruction. This is too much to live up to the great spring, right?</p>
<h3 id="e187">The Whale's Doomsday <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Kangjianzhaifu</p>
<p>Whales, in the ocean, have always had the majestic image of being "invincible in the world." But in this day and age, it seems to have become "a turtle in a jar."</p>
<p>In the past, the tools for whaling were unfavorable, and the methods of hunting whales were still considered to be open warfare. Whales had many opportunities to escape. Since the advent of the bombing-style harpoon, the method of assassination has been used, and the behemoth has had no choice but to surrender. It is said that the exploding harpoon weighs one hundred and twenty pounds and contains twenty-eight pounds of explosives. In general, whales weighing about eighty tons to one hundred tons are inevitably killed by one touch.</p>
<p>At present, the whales in the Arctic Ocean have almost been captured by Norwegian fishermen. There are twenty whaling ships in the Antarctic Ocean, and usually there are one hundred and fifty small whaling fishing boats. It is expected that before the summer of this year, 30,000 whales can be invited by them to land for sightseeing and be slaughtered by the whale factory. There are as many as six thousand Norwegians acting as executioners of whales in the Antarctic Ocean. Unless the whaling fleet considers the virtue of the heavens to love life and gives them a way out, all the whales in the world will be in danger of their offspring disappearing within a few years. The vast sea has no place for it to live!</p>
<p>Prehistoric large animals, such as dinosaurs, have long been extinct in the world. The existing large animals, whales can be regarded as second to none. If it really follows the dinosaurs and disappears soon, it can be regarded as a deeply regrettable event in the history of biology. But who taught you to contain such enviable fat in yourself, and not have a bit of the ability to resist and defend yourself!</p>
<h3 id="e188">The Philosophy of Matches <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Baishe</p>
<p>Matches, this object, in Beiping is called "qudeng" (fire-getter), in Shanghai "zilaihuo" (self-igniting fire), in Jiangbei "yanghuo" (foreign fire), in Japan "rinsun" (phosphorus inch), in the West "match," though the names differ, the thing is the same. Since the "fire steel" was abandoned, matches have become a necessity for every household, a thing everyone uses, and thus striking matches has become something everyone does, and the philosophy of matches is thus invented! Observing the postures and habits of various people when striking matches with a cold eye, one can know their intelligence, foolishness, virtue, treachery... Generally, those who strike inwards are often meticulous, those who strike outwards are often careless, those who rub a long portion are surely foolish, those who rub a short portion are surely clever, those who strike two or three at once must not be economical, those who strike one and use it for two or more guests must be good at socializing, those who casually discard the ashes on the ground must be romantic or lazy, those who forcefully throw away the ashes must be decisive and brave, those who blow out the ashes must be leisurely and slow, those who slowly watch the ashes burn out must be sinister and have deep intentions, those who talk to others and take an unlit match, carelessly breaking it into several pieces and playing with it, must be cunning and scheming. Judging people in this way, how can anyone hide? How can anyone conceal themselves? If you don't believe me, please try it.</p>

<p>It is said that in Jiangsu Province alone, the monthly consumption of opium is 1,200 dan (a unit of weight), which is 14,400 dan per year. Converting this dan into jin (another unit of weight), it is 1,440,000 jin. Converting this into taels (another unit of weight), it is 23,040,000 taels. With each tael valued at 2.5 yuan, the money consumed in the tiny holes of those tea-bean-sized opium pipes each year is 57,600,000 yuan! How can the nation not be poor! How can the people not be weak!</p>
<p>However, this is only Jiangsu Province. If we were to calculate the total consumption of the entire country, it would truly make your jaw drop!</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>After the cocoons are taken from the silkworms, the most cruel scene appears! Regardless of whether the pupae live or die, they throw the cocoons into boiling water, alive, killing the silkworm pupae. After the cocoons have soaked in boiling water for a few moments, they are constantly stirred with a short bamboo tool until a silk thread can be drawn from one of the cocoons. Then they stop stirring, first attaching the thread to a thin cocoon. When the thread is finished, they attach the thread of the second cocoon and continue stirring. In this way, they can obtain skeins of raw silk. I watched the girls doing this with interest and volunteered to try it for a while, but I couldn't draw out a single thread. Of course, this kind of work requires considerable learning! From this point of view, silk workers can be considered a kind of artisan with specialized skills. However, I don't envy them. I just feel that the existence of silkworms is truly the most interesting thing, so I want to study it thoroughly.</p>
<p>"Old Buddha, there's still something I don't understand," I asked Empress Dowager Cixi while she was in a good mood, "Now that these cocoons have been boiled, where will we get silkworms next year?"</p>
<p>"There's no need to worry about that! We have already selected a portion of the cocoons specifically for breeding." She explained patiently, "The pupae inside the cocoons will change! As long as we don't scald them to death, after a certain period, they will turn into silkworm moths. These silkworm moths will never stay in the cocoons again. They will automatically bite a small hole in the cocoons and crawl out. Sometimes, the girls who raise silkworms will even help them tear the cocoons to let them out sooner..." (275)</p>

<h3 id="e192">Sleeping Beauty <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>Previously, this newspaper reported from the China United Press in Chicago that a Western woman named Miss McGirr, 29 years old, fainted on February 15, 1932, while putting on her coat to go out. She fell onto the bed and has been asleep ever since, without waking for thirty-three months, and is known as Sleeping Beauty. Even many doctors do not know what ails her. This year, in January, her mother, Mrs. Milly, discovered that her daughter could open her eyes, and was overjoyed. She wrote words with a pen to show her, and indeed, she recognized them without error. Therefore, the news spread far and wide, saying that there is hope for a cure for the long-sleeping illness. I, for my part, believe that sleeping and becoming ill, and that the illness should be so deep and prolonged, is not unique to Miss McGirr. Let me describe a few examples, so that the reader may be informed.</p>
<p>The reason why people want to sleep is mainly due to mental exhaustion, so overwork leads to fatigue, and fatigue leads to weariness. Secondly, it is loneliness, and thirdly, it is stomach discomfort, or else it is a normal state. All animals have the reason to sleep, fish in the water, even if they are extremely lively, cannot rest. Sleep has a length and shortness, therefore waking also has a difficulty. During deep sleep, even the noise of gongs and drums cannot be heard, while during a light doze, even the sound of footsteps outside the door can be identified by the person. This is the depth of sleep, and awakening is tied to it. To sleep is to be named an illness, then it is not exhaustion, loneliness, or stomach discomfort, but it is also different from the normal state. In the past, a noblewoman in France suffered from this illness from 1883, lasting for sixteen years. She was on the verge of death, almost paralyzed, appearing dead at first glance, but not really dead. Every second she still had eighty heartbeats, but shaking her, her face was blank and unaware. Giving her food, she drank a little broth; not giving her anything, she did not ask for it. After medical treatment, it was said that the body's capillaries are innumerable; if they are relaxed, one is awake; if they are closed, one is asleep. This woman's capillaries were constantly closed and not relaxed, so she constantly slept and did not wake up. The saying has a lot of insight, but it cannot be definitively concluded.</p>
<p>In the land of Geena in Africa, there were scholars in the past who suffered from this sleeping sickness, lying in bed for four years, always associated with pillows, and their mouths were constantly closed, no longer needing food and drink. Some called them "living immortals." Their families used milk, cheese, and other things, injecting them into their stomachs through nasal tubes to prolong their remaining breath. Later, doctors invented "life-saving devices" to test them. The person's sleep was like the person's death. When this device was placed on the chest, if there was even a slight breath, the device would move accordingly, allowing one to see if they were alive or dead, even if they were indeed dead. It was necessary to examine them before people embalmed them, which shows how serious the sleeping sickness can be. This time, Miss McGirr slept for two years and nine months. After this long period of black and sweet dream life, her mother suddenly saw her eyeballs able to move, and took paper and pen to write words, saying "Raise one finger," and the girl slowly responded. Then she wrote "Raise two fingers," and the girl responded again, without any error. From this it was known that she was awake, no longer a person in a dream. But this still cannot be without doubt, let us use one saying to clarify it.</p>
<p>If a person stares at a child, or a weak person, if they directly face their eyes, their expression can immediately change to dazed, and they lose their subjectivity. If, at this time, you tell them that you are in the mountains, then the person suddenly feels like they are on a cliff. If you tell them that you are in the water, then the person is like they are in the sea. If you give them something bitter and say it is sweet, then it is truly sweet. If you give them something hard and say it is soft, then it is truly soft. The five senses and four limbs can all be placed in a passive position. People only know hypnosis, but they can also awaken. Therefore, whether Miss McGirr's temporary awakening was induced by her mother's psychology is also a question. Therefore, I briefly describe it to provide assistance to those who can research this disease.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, whether a person is successful or unsuccessful, the expression of true feelings is most likely to gain the sympathy of others. When Yang Huanhua explained the reason for stealing money, Jia Duocai's heart softened halfway. Plus, he cried very miserably, so he couldn't bear to say anything more to him. He sighed and said: Speaking of which, we are always people from Jiangnan, and since you are stranded in this place, we must help you a little. But if you tell people the truth, and let people help you a little properly, isn't that much better than lowering yourself like this? Yang Huanhua tilted his body, took out a handkerchief, wiped his eyes, and said: Mr. Jia, what you said is naturally right. But I have also walked this road, and it is not passable. Although I ran away from my husband, it was only a temporary mistake, and I am not the kind of person who exchanges my body for money. But I... I... I can't... He couldn't say it anymore. Choking, two teardrops rolled down his thin cheeks. Jia Duocai's heart was already soft, and he felt that the more he spoke, the more pitiful he became. While he was crying like this, he could only stare at him blankly. Yang Huanhua had experienced this kind of hardship in society, and seeing Jia Duocai's appearance, he was somewhat touched. He thought that it was meaningless to just cry to people. If he cried for too long, it might even annoy people. With this thought in mind, he immediately wiped away his tears. He forced a smile to Jia Duocai and said: Mr. Jia, will you forgive me? Jia Duocai said: I am neither a judge nor a policeman, what authority do I have to not forgive you? What happened just now, there is no need to talk about it, fortunately I didn't suffer any loss, Yang Yuanhua stood up and said: Since you say so, I can go back. (164)</p>

<h3 id="e194">Intermediate Frequency Test Oscillator <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Ming Huan</p>
<p>Regarding the application and manufacturing methods of test oscillators, this magazine has previously introduced them in great detail. However, what was described only involved the high-frequency range. This article intends to specifically describe various intermediate-frequency test oscillators. Although the principles are the same, there are many differences in construction, application, and especially frequency calibration methods, so it is necessary to explain them separately.</p>
<p>Superheterodyne receivers have good performance and complex structures. Because of their unique intermediate frequency stage, it is extremely difficult to match them. Many amateur enthusiasts are daunted by the idea of making their own superheterodyne receivers, and even if they try, the results are rarely satisfactory. The main reason is the lack of accurate test oscillators to calibrate the circuits of the intermediate frequency stage to match its predetermined intermediate frequency.</p>
<p>Commercially manufactured superheterodyne receivers are sold only after several precise calibrations, but afterwards, due to various influences, they lose their original resonant state, leading to various problems. For example, the volume is weak, or the stations in the first half of the dial are very loud, while the second half is very weak, or sometimes the stations in the middle section are very loud, while the two ends become weak. In addition, there are squealing noises, and the same station appears at more than two points on the dial, etc. Most of these obstacles are due to improper adjustment of the intermediate frequency stage. If you are testing a superheterodyne receiver, relying only on measuring voltage and resistance, then no matter how accurate your voltmeter is, you will never be able to find the cause of these problems. Therefore, repairing superheterodyne receivers without an accurate intermediate frequency test oscillator is simply helpless.</p>
<p>Intermediate frequency oscillators are not difficult to manufacture, but the calibration of the frequency is difficult. The frequency of broadcasting frequency oscillators can be calibrated using the signals of many broadcasting stations, and shortwave oscillators can also be calibrated by referring to the signals of various shortwave stations. Only within the intermediate frequency range, there is no ready-made signal available. Fortunately, there is a simple method that only requires an ordinary broadcasting receiver to solve this problem.</p>
<p>Now, let us first describe the construction of a simple intermediate frequency oscillator. The circuit is shown in the figure. The capacity of each component is marked in the figure. Any triode vacuum tube can be used. The tuning coil can be wound on a one-and-a-quarter-inch diameter plastic tube with No. 20 double-yarn-covered wire, with fourteen turns per layer, for a total of fourteen layers. The center tap can be tapped out at the 98th turn. The coupling coil can be wound on the outer layer of the tuning coil, about six turns is enough.</p>
<p>After the oscillator is made, the second step is to calibrate its frequency. First, connect the output terminals of the oscillator to the antenna and ground connection of the broadcast receiver. Rotate the tuning capacitor of the oscillator to the center position, and then slowly rotate the tuning capacitor of the receiver until a sharp squealing sound is produced in the speaker. At this time, it indicates that the receiver is in resonance with the harmonic of the oscillator. When searching for this resonant point, an alternating current voltage must first be applied to the plate of the oscillator to modulate it, or the receiver must first self-oscillate, otherwise, this resonant point cannot be found, especially the latter method is more accurate. Any receiver can easily oscillate by simply increasing the coupling density of the screen grid.</p>
<p>After the first harmonic resonant point is found, record the accurate frequency number of the receiver at this time. Continue to rotate the receiver capacitor until the sharp squealing sound reappears. This is the resonant point of adjacent harmonics. The frequency difference between the two resonant points of the receiver is the basic frequency of the oscillator. For example, if you want the frequency of the oscillator to be 175KC, you must gradually change its tuning capacitor to make the frequency difference between the two resonant points of the receiver exactly 175KC.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Various Wiring Methods for Low-Frequency Transformers <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Shi</p>
<p>If a medium-sized transformer is used properly, good results can usually be obtained. There are many ways to connect it. As long as you know the effects of various uses, you can choose the most suitable one. In this short article, I will write down the main connection methods of low-frequency transformers, so that general amateurs can test them one by one and choose them at will, without groping in the dark.</p>
<p>In the first type of experiment, the best transformation ratio of the transformer to be used can be determined. Various transformers (except for a one-to-one ratio) can obtain four different ratios. The first figure shows the usual connection method of a transformer. The plate of the previous vacuum tube is connected to P of the primary winding, and B is directly or through a bleeder resistor to the positive pole of the battery. The grid of the next tube should be connected to G of the secondary winding, and F should be connected to the negative pole of the C battery.</p>
<p>We can also assemble the transformer into an autotransformer. This only requires connecting B of the primary winding and F of the secondary winding. In this connection, the entire coil is combined to make the secondary winding, while the primary winding uses the original primary winding (Figure 2) or the original secondary winding (Figure 3).</p>
<p>For example, if we have a one-to-two transformer, then in Figure 1-1, we can transform it into a one-to-three. In Figure 3, the ratio is two to three, in other words, one to one point five.</p>
<p>Finally, we can also use the autotransformer as a one-to-one temporarily. This only requires connecting it as shown in Figure 4. The name of this type of connection is impedance-capacity-resistance.</p>
<p>In Figures 2, 3, and 4, the capacity of the capacitor method is about 0.005 to 0.05 microfarads, and the leakage resistor R is about 200,000 to 1 million ohms. (It must be determined by experiment)</p>
<p>Now, we must also pay attention that if the current of the previous vacuum tube exceeds three milliamperes, the core of the transformer will be saturated, causing audio distortion. Therefore, a more suitable method is to separate the alternating current component of the plate current from its direct current component, and only let the former pass through the winding of the transformer.</p>
<p>The device in Figure 5 can help us achieve this isolation. The direct current passes through the resistor R (which can be selected between 30,000 and 100,000 ohms), while the alternating current easily passes through the coupling capacitor C. This will not cause saturation.</p>
<p>The quantity of the resistor R is related to the internal resistance of the previous vacuum tube and the maximum voltage used on its plate. Therefore, it is best to decide after experimenting.</p>
<p>In addition, Figures 5, 6, 7, and 8 are related to Figures 1, 2, 3, and 4. As for the experimental comparison method, it is best not to use radio, but to use a pickup, always using the same record and a new needle.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Trivial Notes on Lead-Aluminum Rectification <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Liang Yingchang</p>
<p>(1) Of the chemicals used in lead-aluminum rectification, sodium bicarbonate and borax are more common. Sodium bicarbonate dissolves to give a more concentrated solution, which performs better than borax.</p>
<p>(2) Ordinary regulations require the use of distilled water, which may be due to the common use of distilled water in chemical laboratories, because it does not contain impurities and is reliable to use. In fact, ordinary purified water can also work equally well.</p>
<p>(3) The lead and aluminum sheets must be at least one inch above the water surface, otherwise the copper screws connecting the wires will easily be stained with the solution during operation. After the copper screws are stained with the solution, they will undergo a chemical reaction, which can prevent the passage of current, thus reducing performance or causing work to stop.</p>
<p>(4) The voltage after rectification is still unstable, and its voltage count cannot be measured without adding other equipment. However, the current after rectification has become unidirectional, which can be measured with an ammeter.</p>
<p>(5) Full-wave rectification is not easy to use, because the internal resistance of each bottle (full-wave rectification must use at least two rectifier bottles) should be equal; otherwise, the power output by each bottle will be very different. To maximize the effectiveness of full-wave rectification, the size, distance, and thickness of the solution of each bottle of lead and aluminum should be completely the same.</p>
<p>(6) The biggest drawback of lead-aluminum rectifiers is that they are prone to heat generation and rapid corrosion of the aluminum sheet. The only way to avoid this is to increase the area of lead and aluminum and increase the solution, while reducing the charging rate. Approximately one liter of solution per bottle, one hundred square inches of lead and aluminum, passing one ampere of current, can last for a long time without heating up.</p>
<p>(7) In order to prevent the evaporation of the solution, a certain book teaches people to add a layer of oil on top of the solution, which is not a good method, because the first thing to prevent when using this rectifier is to prevent it from heating up, and the evaporation of the solution is to release its own power. After adding oil, the heating of the solution is accelerated instead.</p>
<p>(8) Shan Tong stipulates that each rectifier bottle can withstand a voltage of 50 volts. To use it at 100 volts, two bottles must be connected in series. In fact, if the current passing through is properly limited to prevent the rectifier from getting too hot, it is also possible to use only one bottle at 100 volts without damage.</p>
<p>(9) When using lead-aluminum rectification, whether using a transformer or directly connecting to an AC power source, it is necessary to prevent discharge after the power source is cut off. Therefore, where there is no generator, charging should be stopped immediately before the power plant cuts off the power.</p>
<p>(10) After the rectifier has been working, the white substance accumulated on the lead and aluminum should be removed immediately to avoid reducing working efficiency. After use, the solution can be poured off, the precipitate removed, and the clean solution saved. A small amount of sodium bicarbonate can be added next time to continue using it, but it should not be stored for too long.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Another Device for Testing Lead-Acid Batteries <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Maosheng</p>
<p>The common instruments for testing lead-acid batteries are a hydrometer or a voltmeter. Now there is also a cadmium tester, which can not only measure the number of voltages, but also check the state of discharge and charge of the positive and negative plates. Its structure, as shown in the first figure, is a combination of a voltmeter, two copper rods, and a cadmium strip. The graduation of the voltmeter is shown in the second figure.</p>
<p>During testing, the cadmium strip is inserted into sulfuric acid, but it must not come into contact with the positive and negative plates, and left for a moment. When testing the positive plate, the other copper rod should be connected to the positive terminal. When testing the negative plate, the other copper rod should be touched to the negative terminal. After the cadmium strip is inserted into sulfuric acid, it will initiate a local chemical reaction, generating voltage. The magnitude of this voltage can show whether the two plates are good or bad. The values are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Charging: Positive pole 2.3v－2.45v (less than this number, the positive plate is sick)</p>
<p>Negative pole (0.iv) — (0.2v) (close to 〇 or above 〇, the negative plate is sick)</p>
<p>(2) Discharging: Positive pole approximately 2.05v Negative pole 0.25v Less than the ratio value, the plate is sick, and must be charged. The above values are shown on the second voltmeter.</p>
<p>Neg Discharged refers to the negative pole during discharge, Charged refers to the negative pole during charging Pos Discharged refers to the positive pole during discharge, Charged refers to the positive pole during charging</p>
<p>As for the voltage calculation of the battery, an example can be used to illustrate it.</p>
<p>Charging: Voltage between cadmium and negative pole is —0.1</p>
<p>Voltage between cadmium and positive pole is 十2.45</p>
<p>Voltage of battery＝2.45＋0.1＝2.45v</p>
<p>Discharging: Voltage between cadmium and negative pole is 0.25</p>
<p>Voltage between cadmium and positive pole is 2.05</p>
<p>Voltage of battery＝2.05—0.25＝1.81v</p>

<p>— Qi</p>
<p>(1) Economical Metal Chassis</p>
<p>Metal chassis for radios are both beautiful and convenient. Especially for AC radios, it can eliminate annoying AC noise. However, if aluminum plates are used for this metal chassis, the price is quite expensive, which is not in line with the economic conditions of general amateurs. I would like to contribute an alternative for comrades to try.</p>
<p>First find a biscuit box of suitable size made of tinplate (if there are other suitable tinplate boxes, they can also be used). Wash off the trademarks and patterned paper attached to the surface, or wipe it clean with sandpaper. Then mix aluminum powder (Al luminrim Powder) (commonly known as aluminum powder, sold in various paint stores) with thin glue and apply it evenly to make it smooth and beautiful. After it is dry, it becomes a practical metal chassis.</p>
<p>(2) Ingenious Pointer</p>
<p>The pointer on the dial is usually a line engraved on the panel, or a pointed indicator cut from paper is used to indicate it. The former damages the panel, which is not very appropriate. The latter is even more simple and crude, and once it is soiled, there is the trouble of replacing it from time to time. Here is a method, using only an ordinary drawing pin, and pressing it on the edge of the dial. The pointed hole in the center of the thumbtack, with the reflection of the panel, has become a natural indicator. (A is the thumbtack, B is the dial.)</p>

<p>— Yang Xuelun</p>
<p>The goal of amateur researchers is nothing more than to hope to assemble a radio that is inexpensive and highly efficient. However, if the cost is low, the efficiency will certainly not be high; if the efficiency is high, the cost will certainly not be low. Since the advent of composite vacuum tubes, this problem has been considerably solved. Because one composite vacuum tube can perform the work of two or more tubes, its efficiency is indeed superior to that of ordinary vacuum tubes. I previously read the "Economic Exchange of 6F7 Dual-Tube Radio" by Mr. Yongyan and Mr. Wu Yingjian in the Shen Bao Wireless Radio Weekly. I immediately purchased one, assembled it according to the diagram, and received nearby radio stations. The volume was indeed loud, comparable to that of an ordinary three-tube radio. However, I could not receive any of the major Shanghai radio stations, even with headphones. It was either too regenerative and howling, or there was a "poof" sound and silence. After repeated disassembly and assembly, I finally discovered the source of the problem. As Mr. Zhang Shouyu stated, the screen grid voltage should not be higher than the detector plate voltage. I will now describe the modified circuit diagram and reception situation in detail as follows:</p>
<p>L 35 mm inner diameter spiderweb coil, 14 turns of No. 26 enameled wire</p>
<p>L1 Same as above, 65 turns</p>
<p>L2 Same as above, 35 turns</p>
<p>C .00046 microfarad variable capacitor</p>
<p>C1 .00025 microfarad fixed capacitor</p>
<p>C2 1 microfarad fixed capacitor</p>
<p>C3 .0005 microfarad fixed capacitor</p>
<p>R2 2 megohm grid leak</p>
<p>R1 500 ohm wire-wound resistor</p>
<p>R2 100,000 ohm potentiometer</p>
<p>R3 75 ohm wire-wound center-tapped resistor</p>
<p>R4 25,000 ohm carbon resistor</p>
<p>RFC Radio high-frequency choke coil (using high-quality domestic goods)</p>
<p>T 3r/2:1 transformer (using high-quality domestic goods) LS loudspeaker</p>
<p>The distance between the two spiderweb coils L and L1 is 5 mm, and the distance between the two spiderweb coils L1 and L2 is 10 mm. The three spiderweb coils are fixed with screws and do not need to be moved. Regeneration is controlled by a potentiometer, so it is extremely stable. When this radio receives Shanghai in Changzhou, the potentiometer can only be turned halfway. The five radio stations, China West, Shanghai, Dongfang, Li Shutang, and Fuxing, can all play sound through the loudspeaker. As for receiving the Central Radio Station and the various radio stations in Changzhou and Wuxi, the impedance value of the potentiometer can be reduced according to the desired volume.</p>
<p>The power supply can be either AC or DC. If using DC, a 6V storage battery can be used, or four cylindrical dry batteries can be connected in series. If it is a semi-AC type, a doorbell transformer can be rewound to supply it. The B voltage must be up to 135V.</p>

<p>After Sassoon's Aggressive Selling, the Near Term Quickly Rebounded; First Rising, Then Falling, but Finally Recovering</p>
<p>The gold market continued to prosper yesterday. However, due to Sassoon's pressure by taking advantage of high prices, it turned down after a rise. Jewish merchants also came to sell, and it once became weak. But Sassoon suddenly demanded to settle the near term first, and market sentiment reacted. In the end, the situation was extremely lively. According to overseas silver market news, the British pound rose and the US dollar shrank. Big players said that the United States would buy in at 125 after the market closed. The exchange rate shrank slightly, and London raw gold rose sharply by one shilling and four and a half pence. Although the over-the-counter forward trading price dropped to 71.12 yuan, it recovered due to the efforts of major investors. The Central Bank's posted price revealed that the British pound was flat and the US dollar shrank, and the customs gold unit rose by 1.7 cents. The standard price of gold bullion rose to 911.5 yuan. The morning opening was higher than expected. After the opening, there was a slight struggle. Later, the foreign exchange market tightened, stimulating buying, and it rose in circles. It was expected that the HSBC's posted price would be flat for the British pound and shrink by 0.0625 for the US dollar. Although there was a lack of influence, the central government suddenly aggressively bought shillings, and banks followed suit. The internal US dollar exchange rate tightened further, once breaking out of the 80 yuan mark. When the central bank took advantage of the high prices to sell, the bulls took the opportunity to emerge, and it immediately fell back. In addition, Sassoon also repeatedly sold shillings, and the foreign exchange market loosened. Under the agitation of selling pressure, the market gradually weakened. However, there were still quite a few people who covered their short positions after falling. There was a slight rebound, but under the pressure of Sassoon's sales, the situation was half fatigued at noon. The market continued to be weak. Jewish merchants Qiao Zhifu and Western merchant Sassoon both sold shillings, and the foreign exchange market loosened again, gradually falling. Major investors took advantage of the low prices to buy, and Indian silver rose slightly by one anna, gradually recovering. Later, Sassoon came to buy the near-term shillings, and market sentiment suddenly reacted, and buying sentiment recovered, gradually improving. However, there were many sales after the rise. Finally, Indian silver shrank by a small amount of one anna, and the shorts seemed disappointed. In the market, demand finally exceeded supply, so it continued to prosper after the market closed. Although the market situation was firm and dazed throughout the day, if there are no special stimuli, the future will still go upstream. The swap points were initially flat and then soared, and there were reports that the source of spot goods was turning strong. It once rose to 1.6 yuan. The day's market situation will be recorded below.</p>

<p>Too Many Short Chips, Swap Points Re-squeezed</p>
<p>According to foreign telegrams yesterday, London big players rose by nearly 0.0625, and the far-term rose by 0.125. It was said that the US dollar would buy in at 0.125 after the market closed. New York silver prices shrank by 0.125, and Montreal forward silver prices rose slightly. London raw gold rose by one shilling and four and a half pence. The British pound shrank by 0.125 against the US dollar, the US dollar fell by 0.075 against the British pound, the British pound fell by 6 pounds against the French franc, and the US dollar rose by half a point against the French franc. The opening price of the foreign exchange market in the morning was 1 shilling and 7 pence and 25 for near-term sales of the British pound and 38.1875 yuan for the US dollar, with no change in both the British and American foreign exchange rates compared to the previous close. The Central Bank's posted price revealed that the British pound was flat and the US dollar shrank by 0.0625, and the customs gold unit rose by 1.7 cents. Under the stimulation of Chinese merchants' psychology, the market became tight after the opening. The central government also came to buy and settle. HSBC's posted price revealed that the British pound was flat and the US dollar shrank by 0.065. It was once extremely tight. The central government took advantage of the high prices to sell, and market sentiment suddenly weakened. Sassoon also came to sell forcefully. The internal market finally turned hard. The situation at noon was uncertain. In the afternoon market, Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu and British merchant Sassoon continued to sell, once turning hard. Indian silver initially rose by 1.1.1.1 anna, which had little impact. Later, Sassoon suddenly expressed his willingness to settle the near-term, and market sentiment reacted and immediately tightened. However, the swap points were re-squeezed, which is also a phenomenon that should occur due to too many short chips. Finally, Indian silver shrank by 1.1.1.1 anna but remained tight. The closing price for near-term sales was 1 shilling and 7 pence and 125 for the British pound and 37.9375 yuan for the US dollar, which was tighter by 0.125 for the British pound and tighter by 0.025 for the US dollar compared to the previous close. Chinese merchants bought and sold inconsistently. The British and American foreign exchange rates were done by Mitsui at 476.875 for June. The day's transaction records will be recorded below.</p>

<h3 id="e203">Securities: Bond Market Stable Before Settlement <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>—Good 5 points, 1 corner to 4 corners unequal—</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, because there were only two days left before the settlement of futures trading, the short covering and swaps in the market had not been adequately resolved. Therefore, it did not become smaller due to the issuance of new government bonds. The surface situation was quite firm, but major investors had not seen a large number of orders, so the future cannot be immediately optimistic. In general, the thirty-fifth long swap was sold by forty-seventh to a considerable extent, and the rest were sporadic retail investors and short swaps. The market price relied on it to remain stable. After the opening in the morning, the selling pressure was slightly stronger, but the shorts took advantage of the situation to swap, which was quite helpful. The salt tax fell the most, and it was also a small triangle, and the rest were only about 5 points and 1 corner. The front row was slightly chaotic in the second round, with highs and lows. After entering, it still slowly strengthened, so it was still good to rise 2 or 3 corners. After the opening in the afternoon, the demand for this month was still high, and there were few sellers, so it continued to rise again. All the good ones rose by 1 or 2 corners. At the close, the long and short swaps became more chaotic. Relatively speaking, the squeeze was still the most. The price result of counting its market price, except for one or two kinds due to the relationship of the squeeze, the current month was slightly smaller by one corner, and the rest all rose, good 5 points, 1 corner to 4 corners unequal. The total turnover was 11,786,000 yuan. The result of its rise and fall is compared and listed on the left (unit yuan, transaction unit 100 yuan)</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that yesterday (21st), in the New York stock market, in the last hour, due to rumors that the Public Works Department planned to stop lending to municipal power plants, the demand for utility stocks increased sharply. The market situation rose by more than four yuan. However, this rumor could not be confirmed. In addition, those related to the market include: (1) The rumor that the Interstate Commerce Commission will soon increase railway expenses; (2) The failure of the amendment to the Raffaletto Public Works Bill, which stipulated that relief expenses would be almost doubled; (3) Professor Kemmer stated in a speech in New York that although the development of the inflation virus is slow, it is extremely powerful. The bond market was mixed. The demand for US government bonds and other high-grade bonds was very good, while foreign bonds fell. Small exchange stocks rose due to the strength of utility stocks. Wheat met profit-taking by the bulls but still rose due to wind and sand. The total turnover for the day was 890,000 shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left.</p>

<p>The yarn market is again in a state of consolidation. The majority of sentiment leans towards a downturn, with many selling on any rise. However, those covering short positions are also active. Major bullish players are still holding on tightly. Overseas third-grade yarn and American cotton have both shown significant stability after the sharp declines. The local yarn market has not fully adjusted to the trend, so it currently appears unstable.</p>
<p>The Golden Rooster Remains Upside Down</p>
<p>In the forward yarn market opening, prices rose slightly in all months due to the stability of American cotton and the favorable closing conditions of the previous day. However, by the second or third round of trading, the market became exceptionally jittery and suddenly declined. This was due to sluggish sales in the spot yarn market and floating profits being taken. The market thus felt increasingly loose and oversupplied. As a result, prices fell by five, six, seven, or nine dimes to one dollar and one dime in all months. At the afternoon opening, the trading floor tightened, and sentiment strengthened. It was reported that customer groups still needed over 1,300 bales, and news about foreign cotton was positive, so short sellers rose to cover. As a result, prices rebounded by four, six, seven, or eight dimes in all months compared to the morning session. Sales included 2,150 bales of Dafu, 1,250 bales of Meiji, 1,000 bales of Shenji, 700 bales of Renfeng, 1,800 bales of Dachang, and 600 bales of Xincheng. Purchases included 650 bales of Suilong, 500 bales of Yichang, 800 bales of Yida, 800 bales of Hexing, 750 bales of Shenchang, 850 bales of Hengde, 1,100 bales of Changfeng, 950 bales of Runkang, and 850 bales of Yongda. The high, low, and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Forward Yarn: Highest Price, Lowest Price, Closing Price, Change from Previous Day's Balance</p>
<p>March: 178.8, 178.0, 178.8, Up 0.30, 31,500</p>
<p>April: 178.3, 177.3, 177.9, Down 0.10, 46,950</p>

<p>July: 178.4, 177.3, 178.0, 0.20, 44,400</p>
<p>August: 178.9, 178.1, 178.7, 38,350</p>
<p>Total: 241,100</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Manufacturers Slightly Increase Offerings</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales were relatively high, with customer groups buying a total of 1,325 bales throughout the day. Market sentiment was unremarkable. Zhentai Yarn Mill offered 500 bales of 10-count Hongfu yarn at a price of 145 yuan. The purchase amounts by customer group are as follows:</p>
<p>Changsha: 20, Jinan: 203, Jiangxi: 45, Inland: 100</p>
<p>Haizhou: 10, Ningbo: 10, Shantou: 30, Guangdong: 60</p>
<p>Luoyang: 25, Wuhu: 5, Yunnan: 160, Sichuan: 150</p>
<p>Tianjin: 500, Peers: 5</p>
<p>The cotton market initially declined but then rose, showing signs of recovery. This was because American cotton saw mixed rises and falls, and Indian cotton also rose by six rupees. In general, small individual investors were unwilling to sell short due to the low prices. However, some believe that the future of American cotton is not yet secure and that Shanghai's cotton inventory remains large, so going long seems premature.</p>
<p>Forward Cotton: Near-Term Decline, Distant-Term Rise</p>
<p>In the forward cotton market opening, prices generally trended higher in all months. This was due to American cotton rising or falling by two to five points and Indian cotton rising by six or seven rupees. Short sellers actively covered their positions, and prices rose by one dime to one dime and a half in all months. However, by the third closing, prices suddenly plunged, and the situation weakened again. According to market sources, Japanese traders sold off, causing the decline. As a result, the current month fell by four dimes, while distant months fell by five cents to two dimes and a half. In the afternoon, it was reported that the unofficial price of Indian cotton had only fallen by three rupees, and there was a temporary possibility of stabilization in American cotton news. Therefore, selling pressure in the market weakened, and sentiment tightened slightly. As a result, prices rebounded by one dime to two dimes and a half in all months compared to the morning session. Sales included 6,500 piculs of Runkang, 2,900 piculs of Shenji, 2,100 piculs of Tongji, 2,900 piculs of Dafeng, 2,400 piculs of Jinchang, 3,400 piculs of Ruida, 3,000 piculs of Renfeng, 8,300 piculs of Changhe, and 1,500 piculs of Yichang. Purchases included 4,600 piculs of Yuanda, 2,200 piculs of Renfeng, 5,700 piculs of Hexing, 2,000 piculs of Changyu, 3,200 piculs of Changfeng, 1,700 piculs of Dachang, 4,300 piculs of Yifeng, and 1,900 piculs of Senkang. The high, low, and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Forward Cotton: Highest Price, Lowest Price, Closing Price, Change, Balance</p>
<p>March: 33.10, 32.85, 32.95, Down 0.30, 26,400</p>

<p>The quantity of forward cotton held in the accounts of the Chinese Merchants' Yarn and Cloth Exchange has increased significantly.

<h3 id="e207">The Reasons for American Cotton's Instability <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Weak Demand…Floating Profits Being Taken…Increased Selling</p>
<p>Turbulent Times…New Cotton Policies…Still Undecided</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened higher due to favorable overseas news. Dealers, mainland merchants, and Liverpool buyers bought in, and prices rose by three to four points in all months. Subsequently, demand weakened, scattered long positions were closed, and local and New Orleans sellers entered the market, causing the market to turn weaker. Simultaneously, this prompted brokers to increase selling and close positions at any cost. Furthermore, the instability of the European situation and the indecisiveness of the U.S. regarding new cotton policies also caused anxiety. Ultimately, short covering and repeat purchases by dealers caused prices to rebound, and the market closed firm. Spot prices rose by five points, while futures prices fell by two to six points. The British cotton market was strong, with spot prices rising by ten points and futures prices rising by one to five points. The Indian cotton market was firm and rising, with Pingguoer rising by 4.5 rupees, Aomula rising by 7.5 rupees, and Bairoxi rising by 6.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated the 22nd):</p>
<p>American Cotton: Change from Previous Day, Equivalent in National Currency, British Cotton: Change from Previous Day, Equivalent in National Currency</p>

<p>Yesterday's flour market saw relatively stable prices in all months after the morning opening. Foreign wheat was quoted at about 12 cents higher in Chicago and 8 cents higher in Canada. When prices opened, foreign wheat was quoted higher, and the current month was tight due to limited spot flour supply, stabilizing sentiment. Although the weather had cleared, trading in all months was still active, but the weakness in the rice market inevitably brought some weakness to the flour market, with prices only improving by 2.5 to 5 percent compared to the previous day. When the afternoon session opened, prices were initially stable, but then gradually declined again. This was due to the absence of outside investors and market rumors of factories continuing to order a shipment of Australian wheat at a price of 4.77 yuan, causing sentiment to weaken. In the current situation, the near-term is firm while the distant-term is weak. As a result, the current month fell by 5 percent, April fell by 1.25 cents, May fell by 1.5 cents, June fell by 1 cent, July fell by 1.25 cents, and August fell by 5 percent.</p>
<h3 id="e209">More Active Buying in Distant-Term Wheat <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's forward wheat market saw relatively stable prices in all months after the morning opening. Foreign wheat was quoted at 8 to 12 cents higher. Trading in the current month was naturally slow due to the proximity of the delivery date. However, sentiment was relatively weak due to the influx of foreign wheat. Distant-term months saw more active buying due to the scarcity of hedging. Opening prices in all months were 12 cents higher. When the afternoon session opened, the current month's market remained weak, closing at only 3.50 yuan. This was due to the stockpiling of foreign wheat, leaving bulls with little room to maneuver. Mainland traders entered the distant-term months, stabilizing the market. As a result, July and August were both up by 2 cents, while other months saw no price change. The spot wheat market was stable, with Shandong Su wheat opening at 3.64 yuan, Mingguang wheat at 3.65 yuan, and Hankou wheat at 3.34 yuan. Fuxin sold 2,000 bags, and Xinda sold 1,500 bags.</p>

<p>Yesterday, shipments of japonica rice to South Shanghai suddenly increased again, totaling 36 or 37 boats (over 7,000 shi of cargo). Sales were only slightly active in the local area, with sales of packaged rice being sluggish. Only the Yantai group purchased a few hundred bags, so the overall market was stable with a hint of weakness. Prices for both thick japonica and thin indica rice remained stable, with no significant changes. Du Yangjian rice was not traded, and the supply of Yin Yuan exceeded demand, causing prices to fall sharply by 12 cents. Only Bian Yuan rice has been out of stock for a long time, and once it is available, it will be stable. The North Shanghai rice market saw a surge in supply from various rivers after the Yujidun river channel reopened the night before, with about 70 or 80 boats arriving. Sales of various types of rice were weak, with mid-grade white japonica falling by 1 cent, early thin indica falling by 7 or 8 cents, and Du Jian falling by 5 or 6 cents. Sheep-tip rice was scarce, and prices were firm. Other prices remained unchanged.</p>
<p>The foreign rice market was initially weak, but sales improved due to strong demand from tea merchants and the mainland, especially poor areas and Chongsha. A total of 13,000 to 14,000 bags were sold throughout the day, causing the market to turn from weak to stable. The native indica market has been suppressed by foreign rice for a long time. Yesterday, cargo owners dumped goods to sell, resulting in prices falling by 1 cent. Local, mainland, and Chongsha buyers then purchased over 2,000 bags.</p>

<p>Xiang Lian prices have recently been weak due to falling prices in Hankou and sluggish sales in Shanghai. There is little chance of recovery. Current sales are limited to small, scattered quantities, and there is no possibility of a turnaround. Yesterday's market prices were as follows: Top-grade Xiangtan Lian arrived at 30 yuan, Jiuxi Lian at 27 yuan, Hengzhou Lian from Quanzhou at 26 yuan, Jinshi at 25.5 yuan, and Changde Lian at 25 yuan. Compared to the previous session, prices have fallen by 2 to 3 yuan across the board.</p>
<p>White lotus seeds have also seen declining prices due to falling land prices in Lanxi and sluggish sales. Prices have fallen by 7 to 8 yuan from their peak. Yesterday, top-grade white lotus seeds sold for 44 yuan, and second-grade sold for 43 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, raw peanut prices rose again by 1 dime and a half due to news of a further 1 dime increase in Qingdao. Prices have now risen by nearly 1 yuan in total. Therefore, in Shanghai, in addition to the 1 dime and a half increase the previous day, prices rose again by 1 dime and a half yesterday. It is estimated that 30 tons of Shandong peanuts were offered, which were purchased by the Guangdong group. Kaifeng peanuts were offered at 6.8 yuan but no sale was made. (The character for "raw" in the previous day's raw peanut market report was mistakenly printed in red. This is now corrected.)</p>
<h3 id="e213">Sugar Market: Rumor of Increased Tax on Foreign Sugar, Guangdong Coarse Sugar White Rises by 3 Dimes <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw great excitement due to widespread rumors that the increased tax on foreign sugar would be implemented on April 1st. As a result, there were no asking prices for goods such as 24 coarse sugar white. The long-sluggish market showed signs of an immediate price surge. At 2:30 PM, the Sugar Industry Cooperative Company auctioned off three batches of Guangdong coarse sugar white: (1) 1,608 bags of high-quality goods, with a reserve price of 17 yuan; (2) 1,300 bags of slightly lower-quality goods, with a reserve price of 16.9 yuan; (3) 1,010 bags of lower-quality goods, with a reserve price of 16.8 yuan. Over 40 companies attended the auction, and most submitted bids for the entire lot. As a result, those bidding for the entire lot only received 97 bags. The entire lot was sold cleanly, creating a temporary frenzy. It is rumored that the reserve price will be increased again at next Monday's auction. Yesterday, prices rose by 2.5 to 3 dimes. The association set a post-auction price of 17 yuan for 24 coarse sugar white, but no sale was made. Transshipment goods were sold at 4.9 yuan, an increase of 1 dime and 8 cents. Chaoqing sugar also showed signs of tightening. Goods from brands were scarce.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Oil Market: Peanut Oil Suddenly Rises by Half a Yuan <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Soybean Oil Also Shows Improvement</p>
<p>Yesterday, peanut oil prices rose by half a yuan compared to the previous day due to a sudden increase of 1 yuan in the production area, causing excitement in the local market. There is still a possibility of further price increases. Soybean oil also improved due to good market sentiment and rising telegrams. Yesterday, an estimated 2,200 pieces of various types of peanut oil and 400 pieces of various types of soybean oil were offered. Please refer to the market price section for price information.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Silk and Tea: Chinese Silk in Desperate Export Situation <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>The export of silk is becoming increasingly dismal. There is almost no news from European and American customers. Based on current Citibank prices, the overseas price of Chinese silk is only around 350 yuan. However, Japanese silk is still able to compete in the world market at this low price. According to Reuters market reports, Japanese silk sales in the US are still over 2,000 bales per day (including both spot and futures). The Indian yellow and white coarse silk market is also dominated by Japanese factory silk. Furthermore, the domestic sales of Chinese silk are also being impacted by rayon. It is truly heartbreaking to see this.</p>
<p>According to a silk industry tycoon, the management of factories in China regarding weaving and reeling, as well as the discounts on silk cocoons, urgently needs to be improved in order to support the struggling industry. In recent years, the financial community has long shied away from investing in the silk industry. The only hope is for effective government relief and a new situation after the unified control of silk cocoons. Currently, only Baotai Silk Factory is operating in Shanghai. The future of the silk industry is bleak, so it is hoped that the authorities and members of society will pay close attention.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Increased Tea Tax in French Colonies Confirmed <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>It has been confirmed that the French colonies in Africa have increased tea taxes. The Alen region of Africa, a part of the French colonies, imports no less than 40,000 boxes of Chinese green tea annually. Historically, this region collected an import tax of 400 francs per 100 kilograms of Chinese tea. Last summer, the Alen colonial government resolved to double the tax. Subsequently, our government repeatedly protested to the French government based on the principle of reciprocity, and the matter remained unresolved for a long time. Sources from within the tea industry have now confirmed that the increased tea tax has been implemented. However, due to China's opposition, the tax rate was only increased by one-third of the original rate, that is, 600 francs per 100 kilograms, equivalent to 120 yuan in Chinese silver per 100 kilograms. Based on this situation, the sales of high-quality Zhenmei tea from China will be significantly impacted.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Cotton-like Silk Rayon Pongee, Exclusively Domestic Product <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>Plain, Slanting Flower Rayon Pongee Imported from Overseas</p>
<p>Rayon pongee comes in three types: slanting flower, plain, and silk-like, all used for lining suits. Silk-like rayon pongee is entirely a domestic product. Plain and slanting flower are all foreign products. Slanting flower is more expensive and has fewer users. Plain and silk-like are slightly more popular. Since domestic silk-like rayon pongee is inexpensive and beautiful, and Western-style clothing stores in Shanghai and other cities are using it as much as possible, the import volume of rayon pongee has decreased year by year. Yesterday, the top-grade silk-like rayon pongee from Guohuo Daohua sold wholesale for 6 dimes and 7.5 cents per yard. Hengfeng Xinhua No. 2 goods sold for 5 dimes and 4 cents. Miscellaneous No. 3 goods sold for 4 dimes and 7 or 8 cents. Imported slanting flower rayon pongee sold for 2.2 yuan, top-grade plain sold for 1.8 yuan, and No. 2 sold for 1.7 yuan. Deji's Riri Deli Jinshan rayon pongee sold for 9 dimes and 5 cents.</p>

<h3 id="e218">Naoya Shiga's Everyday Life Novels <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Xiangshan</p>
<p>From the 40th year of the Meiji period onwards, the Japanese literary scene can be said to have been dominated by Naturalism. After the 43rd year, the emergence of the magazine "Shirakaba" further ignited the great storm of Naturalism. At that time, the basic members of the "Shirakaba" group were Saneatsu Mushanokōji and Naoya Shiga, and Shiga Naoya's art became generally recognized at the same time as the "Shirakaba" magazine swept the literary scene.</p>
<p>If readers are not forgetful, they will remember the "New Village Movement" that caused a sensation for a time! The magazine "Shirakaba" was the vehicle for this movement. Although the movement itself only survives in name, Naoya Shiga, who gained the most popularity in short stories and was a basic member of this movement, is now living a quiet old age in Abiko and has practically withdrawn from his literary career.</p>
<p>Because the author's life is ordinary, he is particularly faithful to real life. He does not have the courage of Zola and others to go to jail or hotels to experience the taste of ordinary people's lives. Therefore, the ordinary life surrounding the author himself has often become a never-ending source of creative material. Works created with this kind of material can be called everyday life novels. Everyday life novels have no grand illusions, and even less "creation from nothing." They express an author's personality and life in an extremely natural way.</p>
<p>Naoya Shiga's novels are mostly short stories. There is probably only one long novel, "A Dark Night's Passing." In his short stories, it can be said that seven or eight out of ten are everyday life novels, the author's own life. I have read seven or eight out of ten of his novels. If I were not an Easterner, possessing Eastern upbringing, it would indeed be difficult to finish even one of his works due to the ordinariness and simplicity of Naoya Shiga's novels.</p>
<p>Even the non-everyday life novels still cannot escape his ordinary choices. So-called shallow righteous figures, students, and deformed people are often realistically presented by him, such as "Van's Crime," "Qingbing's Sanitary Gourd," and "The Student's God." These people are either trembling for survival, or clinging to petty righteousness without speaking their names, or have deformed hobbies, or seek justice on the road. They are truly so-called petty righteous commoners, all realistically portrayed. These characters are all essentially Easterners, especially suited to the lives of ordinary townspeople before and after the Meiji Restoration. Moreover, they are men from Kanto (the old name for Tokyo), not like the characters from Kansai portrayed by Jun'ichirō Tanizaki. Simply put, they are "Edo (the old name for Tokyo) men." They are the products of the commoner thought and chivalrous spirit of the Tokugawa era.</p>
<p>As for Naoya Shiga's everyday life novels, they are roughly divided into four types: personal trivialities, muddled travels, hobbies, and simple, winding relationships with women. Personal trivialities refer to personal matters such as his own likeness and family affairs. Here, he treats sweeping his child's grave, his hatred for his father, the death of his mother and the story of marrying a new mother, his dislike for his grandmother on his grandfather's anniversary, and even the search for a lost dog as subjects for his novels, such as "Reconciliation," "Kensaku's Reminiscences," "Mother's Death and a New Mother," "One Morning," and "Ink Dog." These stories are mostly childhood memories. Although they are too bland, they have a naive and innocent interest because they are expressions of childhood psychology and phenomena. The second type is muddled travels. Muddled travels means running around without a clear purpose, often going from Kanto to Kansai, from Nara to Kōbe, with a nervous disposition. He also sometimes looks for a house in Kyoto all day long but cannot find one, and is even so hungry that he cannot lift his feet but refuses to buy food outside, fearing that he will be infected with all kinds of epidemics. He is truly muddled, as if traveling in a dream, such as in "Living Elsewhere," "Kugenuma Trip," "Okitsu," "Returning to the Capital," "Trivial Matters," and "Condolences for the Earthquake." As for the third type of hobby, it is his internal observation of his life, such as viewing paintings and watching plays. He likes to appreciate ancient paintings, so Buddhist temples often become his places of appreciation. Whether in rainy or windy weather, he can make an appointment with friends to visit Buddhist temples to see ancient paintings. This elegant behavior still retains the elegance of literati in the feudal era, such as in "Toriwo's Illness" and "Twenties." The fourth type, love affairs with women, fully exposes the author's ordinariness. In these love affairs, the male protagonist is a man who is afraid of his wife, but still does some romantic things outside. Sometimes he is even extremely cowardly, fearing his wife's suspicion of him. He sees signs that his maid is pregnant, and thinks that the maid has had an affair, but he is afraid that his wife will suspect him, so he is uneasy day and night. Finally, he confesses to his wife. This kind of timid protagonist makes the reader feel extremely impatient. He even makes the male protagonist feel the pain of a dual personality of love because of the woman's helpless suffering. Examples of these works include "Good People's Marriage," "Infatuation," "Trivial Matters," and "Late Autumn."</p>
<p>In short, when we look at the above four types, we can clearly understand Naoya Shiga's personality: he is a timid, feudal, and suspicious person. Therefore, the stories surrounding his body are also extremely trivial, timid, and suspicious stories.</p>
<p>Someone once criticized Naoya Shiga, saying, "He has too stable a life. If his life were that of a worker or a farmer, then his works would be much more worthwhile." I somewhat agree with this opinion. With his direct and naturalistic skills, he could perfectly describe the hardships of ordinary people's lives, but unfortunately, the life surrounding him is so ordinary.</p>
<p>Naoya Shiga does not regard literature as a profession, and even despises those who regard literature as a profession. Therefore, he is not very passionate about creation, but only regards literature as the same attitude that ancient literati had towards poetry.</p>
<p>Since the end of 1933, after publishing the same "Afternoon on a Sunday," he has completely retreated into seclusion like a cicada in autumn. However, his ordinary and simple naturalistic approach is considered to need review, and the everyday life novels of the Naoya Shiga era are still constantly being produced in the modern literary scene. This is indeed a sad thing.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Hope <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Zhongtian</p>
<p>Hope is like an endless desert, like an unclimbable mountain. People are forever climbing this mountain, climbing! Those who climb well, climb up segment by segment, those who don't, fall to the foot of the mountain. Those with courage can continue to climb, otherwise, they will forever hide in the trap of despair and sigh.</p>
<p>Humanity, whoever they may be, all have this notion of "hope". Even the most foolish and stupid person has their own hopes, only differing in size. Humanity has never had satisfied desires. When one hope is achieved, another thing is hoped for. Because of this, humanity is often dragged into the abyss of depression by "hope". In the past, many people ridiculed Emperor Qin Shi Huang for wanting to become an immortal after becoming emperor, wanting to make himself immortal. They ridiculed him for being too insatiable, but who isn't like that? Having fame, one still wants money. Having money, one still wants a beautiful concubine. Having a concubine, one still wants... This desire will never be satisfied, unless one is lying in a coffin.</p>
<p>At the same time, before each hope is realized, the heart always holds infinite enthusiasm and longing. However, when that hope is in hand, it feels bland and ordinary! People are forever unable to escape boredom and pain in this situation!</p>
<p>Let me take myself as an example. When I was a child, I saw my older brothers and uncles always with pockets full of money, and with many new clothes to wear, and could hit children at will. I was really envious, thinking that it would be great if I were a young man. However, when I grew up, I didn't feel that it was so great, instead, I missed my childhood life. For another example, when I was in middle school, I saw others going to Shanghai to study at university, wearing suits and shiny leather shoes, and I was very envious! Later, I was fortunate enough to go to Shanghai to attend university, but I didn't feel any joy. At this time, I saw others going abroad to study, and I was also dreaming, thinking that if I had the opportunity to study abroad in the future, that would be truly being a "darling of fortune". However, now I am really living a mediocre life in a foreign country, and my current life is still so lonely and so dull! Therefore, I say that people's energy is completely exhausted in the process of hoping, stopping only when their eyes are closed.</p>
<p>I have seen many friends, when he or she is living a single life, truly hoping every day, even dreaming, hoping that he or she would have a lover to accompany him or her through life, that would be happiness; but when he or she one day really finds a lover, isn't he or she still knitting his or her brows, staring at the gray sky and sighing, feeling bored! At this time, they will feel that love is "nothing more than that"!</p>
<p>When every hope is realized, disappointment follows.</p>
<p>Like recently, I always hoped to buy an exquisite vase to put on the bookshelf, and insert a bunch of bright flowers, lilacs or daffodils, so that I could smell the fragrance of lilacs when I came back after class. I believed that a lot of warmth would be transmitted from the fragrance of lilacs to my soul. At this time, I might feel infinite joy! But now, I bought the vase almost ten days ago, and I have already changed several bunches of bright flowers. Dandelions, lilacs, and purple cloud beans have all been inserted, but they don't seem to make me love them in any way. On the contrary, every time I see a piece or two of withered flowers falling on the bookshelf, it makes me symbolize my future life even more.</p>
<h3 id="e220">Man and Wild Boar <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Hei Ying</p>
<p>"Wild boars, they are truly frightening wild creatures!" The storyteller ended his lengthy and tedious narrative with this sentence. Crystal-like beads of sweat seeped from the wrinkles on his forehead, but he didn't bother to wipe them away, only shaking his large head, muttering to himself, indicating that he still found it terrifying to think about. But I walked away nonchalantly, cursing in my heart:</p>
<p>"Cowardly thing!"</p>
<p>But dear readers: here I should tell you that I also encountered wild boars half a year after hearing that story. It was nighttime, and I had no defense at all, so I almost lost my life.</p>
<p>It happened when I was an apprentice at a small port. My father sent me to this tailor shop like a piece of merchandise, and I was handed over to the boss: "Boss, this child is in your hands, please take care of him and teach him." After saying that, he took the original train back. According to the rules here, apprentices are not paid wages, and can only exchange more than ten hours of labor a day for a meal and the worst place to sleep. In the morning, before anyone else got up, I had to leave the warm dreamland and quietly go downstairs to boil water for tea, wash cups, and sweep the floor. Around seven o'clock, when the shop opened and the clerks had all arrived, I had to hurry up and burn the charcoal for the iron, otherwise the boss would twist my ear and scold me. So I had to go to the boss's wife, "What vegetables should I buy today?" Standing in front of this woman with a pockmarked face but a kind heart, I waited like a wooden statue for her instructions. She touched the dense spots on her face, thought for a moment, and as usual handed me the shopping basket, telling me what vegetables to buy back. In this way, I had to go to the vegetable market at least once a day.</p>
<p>Once I saw a wild boar in the vegetable market, hanging bloody, its protruding eyeballs frighteningly large. A group of children surrounded it, gesticulating and telling stories about hunting wild boars—saying that the wild boar hunters set off last night, a total of five people, carrying shotguns, walking to the back of the rubber plantation about twenty miles from the market, and as a result, when they came back this morning, they brought this one back.</p>
<p>The wild boar hunters were resting in the coffee shop. I passed by there, stopped and listened for a while: "...The danger is also quite...You know, when they charged up in a large group, we were hiding in the trees firing guns..."</p>
<p>That day, the entire small port was shaken by a wild boar. Children were shouting and jumping; adults were talking. I recalled the person who told the wild boar story last time, and thought to myself, "If I also had the opportunity to hunt wild boars!"</p>
<p>The opportunity finally came. But it was extremely accidental. One of the shop's collection clerks became ill. At this time, the clothes bill of a Dutch foreman in a nearby rubber plantation was due, and the boss was anxious to collect it. He looked for a long time and couldn't find a way, and finally grabbed me to the counter and said: "The appointment with the Dutchman must not be missed; do you know, he is waiting for you to collect it. If you don't go today, he will definitely not give it to you! They are like that! Go there, okay?" He put on a pleading expression, "It's not far, you can get there in two hours by bicycle."</p>
<p>I had to listen to the boss. Moreover, the boss and the collection clerk always used that bicycle, and I had never enjoyed it. Wouldn't I be able to ride it happily for half a day to the plantation this time? In this way, around two o'clock in the afternoon, I took the bill the boss gave me and set off on the bicycle.</p>
<p>There weren't many people on the road, and both sides were wilderness. The sun shone fiercely on my head. Occasionally, a truck loaded with coconut shells drove past with a rumble, stirring up a cloud of yellow mud and sand, almost making me unable to see the road. The road gradually became uneven, with several places suddenly rising high, as if they were a hill; but when you climbed up with effort, it took no effort to go down again. Then came another hill, and then down again...</p>
<p>When I arrived at the S plantation, I was already exhausted, probably around four o'clock at this time. I asked: "Is the foreman Yokman in?" The answer was that he had gone to the plantation and couldn't come out until five o'clock; there was no way, I had to sit outside the door of that wooden house.</p>
<p>Everything was quiet, without sound, except for the old man pushing a cart, clipping the grass in front of the door with a "cha-cha" sound, I couldn't see any other living thing.</p>
<p>Here I thought, if I get the bill at five o'clock, and then spend two hours on the road back to the shop, won't it be dark? That would be a little awkward. What if I encountered something on the road—like a wild boar, how should I, with no experience, avoid it? After thinking that way, I began to feel uneasy.</p>
<p>Sure enough, on the way back to the shop after receiving the not-so-large amount of money, pushing hard on the bicycle pedals, the sky had changed from gray to black. I lit the small oil lamp in front of the car and groped forward on the yellow sand road. My heart was pounding all the way. At the same time, I was also cursing the boss in my heart: "No conscience! Clearly knowing that I wouldn't be able to make it back today, he still forced me to go; now—" Suddenly a nerve-wracking scream came from the wilderness on the left, and the opposite wilderness seemed to shrink away, a piece of water stretching out. Then I heard a burst of heavy footsteps rushing forward, and the cries of a pig that seemed to have gone mad. My whole body was shaking, I couldn't go forward on either side, and in a panic, I jumped off the car. Immediately, the fierce beast had already approached my side, and I had no choice but to jump into the pool of water. Fortunately, the depth of the water only reached my thighs; standing there watching a thing that was twice as big as the wild boar hanging in the vegetable market pass by, my heart suffocated as if it had been hit by a stone, and then it recovered, and I found the bicycle and fled back.</p>
<p>The next day, I resigned from my apprentice position at the tailor shop. Because of the boss's kindness, he gave me two dollars to buy a third-class train ticket home. When I saw my father, I told him about the experience of almost being eaten by a wild boar; but he unexpectedly said to me: "Child, let me tell you: to live, you must risk life and death; do you think there will be no danger without wild boars? You are wrong. People sometimes eat people too!"</p>
<p>So, on the third day, I was sent back to that tailor shop again.</p>

<p>— By Tokunaga Nao, translated by Ye Yin</p>
<p>Rice that couldn't fit in the warehouse was piled in front of the store.</p>
<p>But the rice in the warehouse wasn't being evacuated anywhere.</p>
<p>My father, who wasn't a permanent employee, simply didn't have work to do for ten or twenty days.</p>
<p>My mother, who went to get "leftovers," fought with my father every day.</p>
<p>"When Dad comes back, he'll definitely become rich; then, we won't be called 'leftover eaters' anymore, and life will get better..."—My hope completely fell flat.</p>
<p>When I was a second-grader, my older sister was already a fourth-grader. Because my sister was a girl, she was able to pay more detailed attention to the family's living situation than me; she discussed it with my mother herself, dropped out of school, and became a worker at the tobacco monopoly bureau.</p>
<p>Falsely claiming her unqualified age of thirteen as fifteen, in order to get a daily wage of sixteen cents, my sister got up at five in the morning and hurriedly ran to the monopoly bureau a mile away from home.</p>
<p>My sister was small in age, but very mature; however, her height was as small as mine. My sister, with a dirty towel holding a lunch box tucked under her arm, ran home in the evening, very hurried. In order to have a sixteen-cent salary to collect, my sister was really hurried.</p>
<p>"Because compulsory education has been extended to six years, you must go to school." Although there was also urging from the village chief and the principal; however, my mother ignored it. My sister simply didn't care either.</p>
<p>(IV)</p>
<p>The following year, I entered the third grade, placing third in the exam. Among the students in elementary school, there was also mutual discussion about teachers accepting bribes from children's guardians to deliberately inflate or deflate the released grades.</p>
<p>However, I didn't care about that kind of thing at all. There were also classmates who provoked me, saying that the class leader Ueno's academic ability was not as good as mine, and asked me what I thought; but for me, that kind of thing was fine no matter what. Anyway, I wouldn't be able to enter middle school, and after graduating from the fourth grade, I would have to rush to work in some factory to earn money—for me, who was thinking that way, that kind of thing was completely unwilling to get involved in.</p>
<p>That year, my mother gave birth to another baby. There were already five of us siblings. In order to take care of the newborn boy, the days I didn't go to school were even more than before. Often, I wouldn't go to class for a whole week.</p>
<p>Even so, I wasn't unhappy to go to school. I liked carrying my youngest brother on my back, standing near the back door, looking at various books. Whether it was the Chinese textbook, the illustrated novels, or old women's magazines, I often read them using only the method of looking at the letters. And I was very good at reading Chinese characters with Han sounds. The novels, etc., were marked with several kinds of pronunciations, and when the people nearby came to listen, I would proudly read out Iwami Jūtarō's slaying of the big snake, Hachi-ryū den, Kan'ei San-bajutsu, etc.</p>

<h3 id="e223">The Problem of Incorrect Characters <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Ba Shan</p>
<p>In recent years, the issue of incorrect characters has been a hot topic in literary circles.</p>
<p>First, there was Mr. Liu Bannong's doggerel, mocking the "advocating" and "studying abroad" of exam candidates; then there was Mr. Cao Juren's advocacy of incorrect characters, and Mr. Lu Xun's sophistry on the application of incorrect characters. This has already attracted a lot of attention. Recently, "common characters" are being promoted collectively, and the advocacy of incorrect characters is intentional. This has become a major issue in writing and using characters.</p>
<p>Originally, ancient people used incorrect characters, which is the so-called method of "general borrowing". The "false borrowing" category in the Six Writings of the Han people is also an explanation of the application of incorrect characters. And because of the differences in dialects in various places, people now are still actually using incorrect characters. The local phrase "man hao" (quite good) is called "man hao" (full good) in some places; therefore, some people write "man hao" in literary books, and some people write "man hao," but in fact "man" (蠻) and "man" (滿) are both correct, and are not incorrect characters; but for people in places that speak the dialect of "man hao," the phrase "man hao" is seen as an incorrect character. In order to eradicate illiteracy and facilitate literacy, it is correct to teach people to read in various places using local dialects, even if it means using incorrect characters. Because even though they are incorrect characters, it is much easier for illiterate people to understand them by recognizing the sound. However, although I agree with the application of incorrect characters, it is only as mentioned above, when teaching illiterate people to read that the application of incorrect characters is correct; but if we, who already know many characters, are now asked to recognize incorrect characters, I dare not agree.</p>
<p>The first issue of the "Common Characters" vocabulary applies quite a few incorrect characters, and some of the "Common Characters" are not even popular incorrect characters. Even those of us who already know many characters do not recognize them. If this kind of "promotion" continues, and all kinds of magazines and books apply them in the future, I am afraid that even those of us who already know many characters will become illiterate. This is a major reason and justification for not daring to agree. Among them, writing "窮" (poor) as "穷," "懊" (annoyed) as "　," "讓" (allow) as "　," "腰" (waist) as "　," "塊" (chunk) as "块," etc., are all characters we do not recognize. Also, writing "從" (from) as "从" and "叢" (thicket) as "从" has already used one character for two purposes, making it impossible for people to distinguish them. Moreover, writing "麼" (question particle) as "　" is the same as the original standard character "　," which also feels inappropriate.</p>
<p>It is said that various magazines have published the first issue of the "Common Characters" vocabulary for a long time, but the reason for not printing the magazines in "Common Characters" is to first make people recognize the "Common Characters;" and it is also said that after two or three months, when everyone recognizes the "Common Characters," all magazines will be printed in "Common Characters." In this way, it means that we who already know many characters will become illiterate in these two or three months, and we should recognize the "imperial" vocabulary like elementary school students who are just beginning to learn to read.</p>
<p>For the sake of popularizing education and promoting culture, it is originally right for everyone to endure a little hardship; but it always seems unreasonable to us to ask everyone to endure hardship to recognize the non-popular characters used in "Common Characters." The "promotion" of "Common Characters" is a "middle way" of "simplifying the complex" and "choosing the easy over the difficult." Since it is an incomplete job and still requires everyone to endure hardship, I would rather recognize Latinized characters and have a thorough reform of the writing system.</p>

<p>— Er Lang</p>
<p>In the writing room, A Gen was originally about to burst into flames. He came out and walked to the factory gate, and when he encountered the foreman, he glared at him and sneered. He couldn't bear it anymore. "Fuck your mother!" he shouted, and was about to pounce on him and beat him up, but he slipped away and went into the factory. A Da next door walked over, looking at him with strange eyes, and asked, "What's the matter?" A Gen met an acquaintance and couldn't help feeling a pang of grief, wanting to cry, but he held it back: crying is not for manly men. He lowered his head and answered him listlessly, "Fired." A Da was so surprised that his eyes turned white, and he asked again, "What's the matter?" He snorted, "That foreman pig," saying it unclearly, the fire of anger burning his head dizzy. A Da immediately remembered what happened yesterday.</p>
<p>Yesterday, A Gen and A Tai were working in the electrical room. A Zu often sighed, and A Da asked him, "What's the matter?" (A Da's "What's the matter?" had almost become his catchphrase, but in his environment, there were many things happening that made his catchphrase of "What's the matter?" impossible not to use). He was thinking, if the landlord always forces the rent, and last month because of illness, almost all of the wages were deducted! A Da sympathized. The two of them went from hating to cursing the factory. A Da had suffered before, and his words were not very激烈的。 A Gen didn't care about anything, cursing everyone and saying everything. Unbeknownst to them, the foreman was patrolling to the electrical room, and A Gen was exactly cursing the foreman pig. The foreman pressed his face close to his body, asking, "Who are you cursing? Fuck your mother!" and slapped him in the face. A Gen despised that pig the most, you hit me, good, he reached out and punched him. Although that pig was wearing a suit and looked like he had a strange martial spirit, but it was a silver-like wax spearhead, completely unable to withstand it, and A Gen gave him a light punch, and he fell into the coal pile. Groaning, he didn't dare to respond, and fled out of the electrical room in a mess...</p>
<p>Fired, what can I do? Although A Da sympathized, he had nothing to say, moreover, he was also suspected. He comforted A Gen for a while and went to the factory to work. A Gen lifted his dull and heavy feet, running around on the road. He passed the door of a small tavern, and the little girl inside selling songs, along with the stiff erhu, was singing "Ten Shouldn'ts". He made up his mind to spend the copper coins on his body on drinking, so he went into the tavern and sat down, put his right foot on the head of the stool, and called the waiter for four taels of white liquor. The couplet on the wall said, "The universe is large within the pot, the days are long in the barrel," he drank the wine and became a wine immortal.</p>
<p>A woman flashed past the door, holding a child in her arms who was gnawing on a big cake, dragging a dirty five or six-year-old child by the edge of her clothes. She glanced at A Gen and turned back to pace into the tavern. A Gen didn't expect it and was startled by her grab. The woman said, "Why aren't you going to work? You're able to float here, you dead drunk!" A Gen didn't open his mouth, only drinking his white liquor. The woman became even fiercer, "Dead drunk, you don't go to work today, you don't know that the landlord came to collect the rent, you're asking me to stand in the front, and you don't even want to think of a way? Drinking your life-shortening wine, where will we get rice for the night? You don't care about the big crying and the small shouting?..."</p>
<p>A Gen really wanted to take the opportunity to beat his wife up, but seeing the two little devils, big and small, next to him, thinking that from now on he would be fired, and the family didn't know what to do, eating the northwest wind? The more he thought about it, the more worried he became, and the woman's poisonous curses didn't blow into his ears...</p>
<h3 id="e225">Nun <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Tuo Ren</p>
<p>The green bamboo, spreading across the hillside, is as lush and green as if carved from jade. Within this jade-colored bamboo forest, the tips of red roofs are faintly revealed. During the day, the spring breeze rustles the tender green bamboo leaves, and the sound of the wooden fish, deep and resonant, drifts with the spring breeze into the ears of travelers on the road. When the sun sets in the west, the temple bell sounds like a lonely person's song in the wilderness, its tone somber and melancholy. This is a serene nunnery, forever spending its desolate years within this verdant bamboo forest.</p>
<p>When spring arrives, I think of the scenery in the warm breezes of the South. Especially, I am reminded of the tranquil "Emerald Bamboo Nunnery."</p>
<p>It must have been five years ago! I spent my days wandering through that emerald bamboo forest. At that time, I felt the transience of life and a sense of disgust for the social environment. I thought, I would also like to leave the reality of life and hide in the quiet mountains and forests, pursuing the sweetness of illusions, a peaceful dream. But after all, I didn't make the dream come true. I am still on life's journey in this realistic society, living a wandering life. Now, it has been five years. In these five years, I have not been fortunate enough to revisit that serene scenic spot, and I can only cherish the happy old dream of it in my imagination.</p>
<p>When I think of "Emerald Bamboo Nunnery," I think of Jing, the nun.</p>
<p>Jing, a young nun. Her youthful face showed a faint pallor, and her delicate dark eyebrows and clear eyes revealed a pensive sorrow. Her figure, her entire outline, revealed her to be a beautiful and serene woman. She often used silence to answer other people's questions, and she often used a smile to hide her sorrow. In the nunnery, she was a person who was loved by others, but she never showed affection for anyone.</p>
<p>Few people know her background. Although, from the outside, she must be a noble lady, and educated. But why did she become a nun? No one could guess.</p>
<p>One spring afternoon five years ago, I went to "Emerald Bamboo Nunnery" to play, and unintentionally, I noticed her. The reason I noticed her was also very accidental. When I walked behind the nunnery, wanting to go into the bamboo forest, I discovered her. At that time, she was sitting alone on the stone embankment of the ancient well. Immediately, I felt very strange: I felt that the nun must have some background. From that day on, the impression of her in my mind became stronger and stronger day by day.</p>
<p>Gradually, I got to know her. My curiosity was strong, so I often asked about her background, but her answer to me was silence. It seemed that all the words,</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>were exhausted in that silence. After several disappointments, I stopped asking.</p>
<p>A few months later, I went home. Not many days after returning home, it was already high summer. In the morning sunlight, I received a very long letter from her, and one section of the letter read:</p>
<p>"...Perhaps you will be annoyed, why didn't I tell you my background? In fact, if you are angry because of this, then you are an ignorant person. You know that in this society, it is very easy for a woman to be destroyed. The reason I became a nun is because this society forced me to. The reason I don't tell people my background is also to preserve myself from being completely destroyed, that's why I remain silent... I don't believe in gods, but I want to be a nun. I am already ready to die, I already feel that life is tasteless, but I still want to live, this is my contradiction, and it can also be said to be the contradiction of society. I also understand that being a nun is not a good outcome, people can be destroyed, and nuns will also be poisoned one day..."</p>
<p>After receiving the letter, I realized that she was also a weak person under the evil forces of society, who would eventually be sacrificed.</p>
<p>Time passes quickly. It has been five years since receiving this letter. There has been no news from each other. I have been wandering in a foreign land for five years, and is she still existing in this society where the weak cannot survive?</p>
<h3 id="e226">That Fellow, Xiao Wang <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Qi</p>
<p>That fellow Xiao Wang has a long and crooked head, his cheekbones are high and upturned, his mouth is sharp, his skin color is as black and shiny as the asphalt used to pave roads, and his eyes dart around mischievously. His body is quite strong, and he doesn't mind walking long distances at all. His appearance is no different from a wild child roaming the streets, scavenging through trash cans for cigarette butts.</p>
<p>Does that rascal have any prospects? No. Although Xiao Wang is my fellow villager, I always look down on him, especially when he speaks, his awkwardness becomes even more vivid, making people find him repulsive and ridiculous.</p>
<p>Xiao Wang loves to gossip. When a group of guys are chatting idly, no matter what they are talking about, he always has a part to play. When people start talking about women, Xiao Wang becomes especially energetic, his protruding teeth showing as he grins, while he stutters and chatters:</p>
<p>— Hey, all you guys ever do is talk about love and stuff. You get weak in the knees when you see a woman. But… I've always looked down on that. What's so special about those girls? If you gave them to me, I'd have to think about it. With money, you can get any pretty girl you want. Hmph, what's so special about them? Right?</p>
<p>— Pshaw, Xiao Wang, don't talk big. Take a look in the mirror first. You wouldn't say no to any of them.</p>
<p>Someone needles Xiao Wang with a mocking tone. Xiao Wang doesn't blush. He knows he has an ugly face, but he has never blamed his parents for it, nor has he ever made a fuss about it. When people use this to tease him, Xiao Wang becomes proud instead:</p>
<p>— Hmph, that's not the way it works. I don't need to use a pretty-boy face to please the girls. My awkwardness makes the girls have to be nice to me. That's what's strange!</p>
<p>— Nobody believes you. Nobody believes your bragging, Xiao Wang.</p>
<p>— Gah! Xiao Wang, swear an oath then. Say, "If I, Xiao Wang, am bragging, may lightning strike me dead."</p>
<p>Then, Xiao Wang would launch into a story as if reciting it, babbling about when this girl treated him to a meal! When that girl gave him money to spend! By the end of the year, he could remember at least a dozen women whose pockets he had picked.</p>
<p>— Bragging, bragging. Xiao Wang, take a look in the mirror first.</p>
<p>Whether what Xiao Wang was saying was a lie or not, that's not important.</p>
<p>Xiao Wang never says anything serious all day long. He's always out and about, loafing around, and letting the days pass by. But he wears a coffee-colored Western suit that isn't too shabby, black leather shoes, and his tie is neatly tied. He smokes, goes to the movies from time to time, and eats at restaurants. He has never had a fixed residence of his own. Wherever he goes, that's where he is. Wherever he eats and stays, that's where he'll find it. No one knows exactly what line of work Xiao Wang does or how he makes his living. So you ask him:</p>
<p>— Xiao Wang, you don't work. How do you make a living?</p>
<p>— Of course I do. Although I don't work, I live quite comfortably.</p>
<p>Xiao Wang smiles, pride showing in his smile.</p>
<p>After he says that, you secretly feel that Xiao Wang is pretty good for nothing. He has no job, but he lives as leisurely as other people, and even more impressively. Where does he get it all from? Only Xiao Wang himself knows.</p>
<p>What exactly does Xiao Wang do? Even I can't figure it out. At the same time, I don't want to press him about it, because sometimes when I accidentally touch on this topic, he always seems hesitant to tell the truth. Sometimes I see that he doesn't have a cigarette in his mouth—cigarettes are as essential to him as rice. Then I understand that Xiao Wang is broke. But he has never asked me for half a cent. At most, he'll have a meal with you.</p>
<p>Xiao Wang has enormous courage, two thick legs, and a fist like a hammer. He doesn't care if someone hits him, but if he lands a punch on you, it's sure to hurt you in the back. It would be perfect to have Xiao Wang as a thug.</p>
<p>But I haven't seen Xiao Wang for a long time. I was wondering, and it happened that one day I ran into someone on the street who was often with Xiao Wang. He told me: Xiao Wang has been arrested for a few days.</p>
<p>"What for?" I asked in surprise.</p>
<p>"Only Xiao Wang himself knows."</p>
<h3 id="e227">The Story of Carrying the Donkey <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>Being a person is really difficult!</p>
<p>Being muddled-headed won't do: being serious is also not right.</p>
<p>Keeping oneself clean and good is individualism; going with the flow is being complicit in evil.</p>
<p>Being poor will be looked down upon; being rich will also be envied.</p>
<p>If you just get by, people will say you are living a life of drunken stupor; if you strive for progress, they will mock you for climbing up.</p>
<p>Revolution is for radicals; not revolution is for cold-blooded animals.</p>
<p>Wearing a queue and binding feet will of course be laughed at as being backward; wearing high hats and high-running shoes will inevitably be cursed as being trendy.</p>
<p>In short, nothing is satisfactory!</p>
<p>There is an Indian story that says: Once upon a time, there was an old man and a child who were using a donkey to carry goods to sell. After the goods were sold, the child rode the donkey, and the old man followed on foot, but passersby blamed him, saying that the child was ignorant for making an old man walk. So they switched places, with the old man riding the donkey and the child running behind. But others said the old man was heartless. The old man quickly hugged the child onto the saddle. Later, people who saw them said they were cruel for two people to be riding a donkey. So the old man and the child both got off. After walking for a while, others laughed at them, saying they were fools for not riding a perfectly good donkey. At this time, the old man sighed to the child, "We can't do it this way, and we can't do it that way. We only have one way left, and that is for the two of us to carry the donkey."</p>
<p>I think; the difficulty of being a person is sometimes as difficult as carrying a donkey!</p>

<p>Opening: "Talent and Sentiment"</p>
<p>One part talent, one part sentiment, when talent is high, sentiment is also deep. Beautiful women invariably pity talented men, and talented men have always loved beautiful women. But then again, what's so hateful is why sentiment isn't evenly distributed. Thinking about the changes, sentiment isn't starting today, in the beginning, there were a lot of people who went through this. Some began with chaos and ended with abandonment, and some went from being enemies to being in-laws. One should know that Li Yi was heartless and forgot his previous promise, and Wang Kui betrayed his original alliance. You shouldn't learn from Song Hong, who didn't abandon his wife, or from Princess Lechang, who didn't remarry. It's not that human sentiment is thick or thin, it's just that talent is shallow or deep. You should know that dreaming of willows brings good matches, and poems written on leaves can also lead to marriage. It's ridiculous that worldly people are so lost and treat stealing jade and fragrance as proper, and that dew-like couples think things are right, leading to jealousy and quarrels, which is improper, and only causes disturbances. However, one can't avoid matters of love, and total friendship can be mistaken by some. As a result, those who can be moved should be moved.</p>

<p>Ida Cantor, wife of Eddie Cantor, the protagonist in "Congratulations," jumped up and exclaimed, "This is really annoying. If anyone asks me this again in the future, I'm going to scream!"</p>
<p>It turns out that everyone who sees the wife of this comedic master asks her, "Is he as funny at home as he is on the screen?" Ida said angrily, "For example, if your man is a bricklayer, or a chimney sweep, or a riding instructor, and people see you and constantly ask you, 'Does he always build walls at home? Can he paint flagpoles? Or does he ride horses in the living room?' How would you feel?"</p>
<p>"Oh, you wouldn't like it? I don't like it either. I married a real man who happens to be a comedian, not that I married a comedian who happens to be a man." Ida's statement is already quite humorous.</p>
<p>But Ida admitted that her husband is indeed very clever at home sometimes, but it's not pointless humor; it's deliberately done to make them laugh. She recalled one time when her husband came home from outside. He told her he was extremely tired and was going to take a nap. Ida and her five daughters then quietly stayed out of the way to let their father sleep. Eddie then went upstairs to sleep. After a while, Ida and her five daughters suddenly heard footsteps on the stairs. They looked back and saw Eddie walking down the stairs with his eyes closed, his hands outstretched in front of him, looking like he was sleepwalking, muttering, "It's too quiet at home. I'm sleepwalking. Someone make some noise to wake me up." He was wearing a top hat and a bathrobe. This astonished them all.</p>
<p>Ida said, "Indeed, he often plays the fool at home, especially when we have some quarrels or disagreements. These little things are unavoidable in even the best families, but when Eddie finds out, he tries to make us laugh and make everyone happy. In Eddie's mind, the family is the center of his universe. The reason he can be funny on screen is because he is happy at home."</p>
<p>Ida then talked about the time before she married this comedic star: "I've known him for a long time. I knew him when he was still wearing short pants. Those short pants weren't for playing golf. Back then, when a group of kids were playing under the subway stairs, if anyone mentioned golf, we would definitely think he had eaten too many turnips. We went to school together at Henry Street Elementary School back then. I admired his cleverness and humor very much, so we were particularly close. He often walked with me and carried my schoolbag. He still often says, 'I used to carry your textbooks, but now you carry my bankbooks.'"</p>
<p>It turns out that Eddie Cantor once worked as a tailor. This was also revealed by his wife. He became a tailor because of her. Because after Eddie went on stage and played the fool, they began to talk about marriage. But Ida's family opposed her marrying a stage clown. Therefore, Eddie abandoned the path indicated by his talent and left the stage. He looked for many other jobs, and one of them was working as a tailor at a clothing company. But he was soon fired by the owner because he unknowingly cut good fabric into many little dancing figures.</p>
<p>From then on, he did many other jobs. For a whole year, he repented and wanted to be an ordinary person, clearing out the singing and dancing in his blood, but in the end, he was unsuccessful. "So I gave in," said Ida Cantor. "Although he still insisted on being a 'gentleman' to please my family, I knew he couldn't go against his talent and his heart. So I decided to call him back to the stage. I also resolved to marry him regardless of my family's opinions. So I didn't marry him because he was a comedian, but because he was the only person I admired, whether he was a comedian or not. Until now, my decision has been infinitely rewarded."</p>

<h3 id="e234">### Review of "The Golden Lotus Tragedy" <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Warren</p>
<p>Have A Heart - Shown in Nanjing</p>
<p>In literature, many works have succeeded in depicting the tragedy and comedy of physical defects and disabilities. This is not only because people with psychological abnormalities have rich processes and phenomena that can be described, but also because the people involved have extremely deep inner sorrow due to certain defects, making it easier to write something touching?</p>
<p>"The Golden Lotus Tragedy," as the translated title indicates, is about a tragedy enacted by a young lady due to her unfortunate foot. The author uses the female protagonist Sally's teaching of dancing to implant in the audience's mind the impression of her beautiful, colorful, delicate, and lively movements. Then, he uses the pre-wedding revelry to maintain the joyful atmosphere of the drama at a considerable level. Then, abruptly, due to a misstep in the joy, she fell and became physically disabled. This turned the plot into a tragedy. Moreover, the fact that her fiancé no longer loved her because of her misfortune won the audience's sympathy for her and maintained the mood of meticulously depicting her life thereafter.</p>
<p>The plot unfolds in Sally's loving life with Jim, a candy and ice cream company salesman, depicting how she tries to hide her flaws, how he happens to discover them, and how, on the contrary, Jim loves her even more because she has suffered this regret. These are the ups and downs and twists and turns of the play. In fact, if the playwright could have found a way to end it here, it would still have been a good script. However, he dragged out the plot unnecessarily with a chance occurrence, dragging the plot into a detective case, with Jim being wrongly accused of being a thief and imprisoned, and Sally redeeming him with money, only for him to leave in anger, doing these simply superfluous scenes. The author was also afraid that this would make the audience impatient, so he used intense actions such as horse racing and catching the real thief as stimulation. Then he let Jim run to Sally, whose foot disease had been cured but who was disheartened, to rekindle the flames of love, completing a happy ending.</p>
<p>Such a plot, while gaining so-called twists and turns, inevitably becomes a mediocre tune.</p>
<p>Director David Butler's handling of this film is quite commendable. At the beginning, only a few simple scenes depicted Sally's life and personality very vividly and deeply. The atmosphere of the pre-wedding night was also quite sufficient. In Sally's dialogue and expressions with the doctor, and her special attention to her feet when making toy idols, Jim's sudden visit and her desire to hide her sick foot but being unable to do so, a few short shots portrayed the mood of a girl with a physical defect extremely well. Secondly, the appearance of children and dogs in the play is also very appropriate and effective. The former shows Sally teaching a large group of children to dance at the beginning, and the group of children surrounding and cheering when she and her lover Joey go out. Before she meets her second lover, Jim, while sitting at the window with a disability, a group of street children surround Jim buying candy and singing along with him, which makes for a powerful correspondence before and after. The latter, the several appearances of this little dog, serve as a companion to the heroine's sorrow and as an important thing in her memories or connections.</p>
<p>From her debut in "Little Women" to starring in this "Golden Lotus Tragedy," Joan Bennett has achieved a very pleasing result. Her pretty thin face and figure, as well as her portrayal of the mood of a girl with a physical defect and unspeakable pain in her life, are particularly moving. James Dunn, who plays Jim, is rugged, and Una Merkel, who plays her friend Joan, is a bit straightforward, and her sentimentality is a fitting and contrasting portrayal.</p>
<h3 id="e235">### Review of "The Wife's Lover" <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Han</p>
<p>Hat Coat Glove</p>
<p>— Shown at the Great Shanghai Theater —</p>
<p>Changing the title "Hat, Coat, Gloves" to "The Wife's Lover" not only has a seductive effect on business appeal, but also explains the husband's sadness, which is the main part of the play, in the title. Yes, if "The Wife's Lover" can move married people, it is because the lawyer Robert discovers that his wife is having an affair but cannot ignore the dignity between husband and wife. In this kind of place, capitalist writers, in literature and in drama, often depict it as a contradiction between emotion and reason.</p>
<p>It is said that this film is adapted from a stage play. If the original play was a five-act play, then the first act would be the husband and wife and the wife's lover buying hats, coats, gloves, etc. in Shangtang, the second act would be the husband having dinner at his wife's house and hearing his wife talking on the phone with her lover, the third act would be the wife's lover - the young painter - wearing the husband's old coat at the wife's house, the fourth act would be the young painter leaving his model and the model's accidental death, and the fifth act would be the court.</p>
<p>Of course, I have not seen the original script. This is just a guess based on what I saw in the movie. However, if my guess is not too wrong, then the traces of the stage play in the movie "The Wife's Lover" are easy to find. Everyone knows that the superiority of movies is that they are not limited by time and space. However, Madame Dubarry's sudden testimony in court is the original-like application of the stage play, because in the stage play, Madame Dubarry's house cannot be a separate act, but in the movie, it is not necessary to do so. The heaviness of the dialogue is also too much cherishing of the original play. So much dialogue is annoying in the movie no matter what. What remains to be said is that the so-called "no coincidence, no play" is almost entirely organized by coincidence here. Therefore, people cannot help but feel that this is acting, and there will never be such coincidences in the world.</p>
<p>Apart from writing about the so-called sadness of the husband losing his wife's love, there is almost nothing commendable in the play. And in capitalist society, love disputes between husband and wife are so ordinary! However, American films often feel great interest in this area. Even more mediocre is that here, like ordinary comedies and tragedies, there will inevitably be a reunion.</p>
<p>From the court scene to the scene of the painter's model's accidental death, it can be seen that the director worked very hard. The model's crazy transformation after being heartbroken, contrasting with the lawyer's shared fate, certainly brings out the emotions of the play, and the various things in the court are not stagnant or dull, which is even more commendable. In particular, the laughable and coy demeanor of Madame Dubarry is used as an interesting interlude, which can make the atmosphere lively and vivid. As for the plaintiff lawyer's clever arguments, contrasting with the defendant lawyer's rebuttal of all the evidence, this implies that the law of our capitalist society is really too childish, although the author's original intention was not this. However, Ricarco Cortez's sentimental acting skills make this ordinary film work much more colorful.</p>
<h3 id="e236">### "The Escape" Will Be Released Today <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Qingyun</p>
<p>The great production of Yihua Company this year, "The Escape," a music and song film filmed on location in Mongolia, Chahar, and Suiyuan, has been decided to be released today (23rd) at the Jincheng Grand Theater. The main purpose of this film is to expose the miserable situation of the enemy oppressing our Chinese nation, the evil deeds of those who are not human, and the ugly faces of hypocrites who use public welfare as a name to collect money for their own benefit. At the same time, it vividly depicts on the screen the plight of the refugee people who have been occupied by the enemy and have no home to return to. The plot is realistic, the performance is exciting and tense, and the two songs interspersed in the film, "The Escape Song" and "Song of the Village Girl in the North," are also extremely tragic, heroic, and listenable. Other aspects such as directing, photography, and scenery are also beautifully achieved. Art-loving friends, "The Escape" is really a masterpiece not to be missed.</p>

<p>In order to promote Sino-Russian cultural communication and introduce its films, the Soviet Embassy in China specially invited people from all walks of life in China and abroad to visit the Soviet film "Arctic Heroes" ("Heraos of the Arctic") at the Capital National Grand Theater on the evening of the 20th of this month. More than a thousand guests attended, all of whom expressed satisfaction with the film and praised it. However, the guests that evening entered the venue with invitations, causing many viewers to feel regretful. In response to the enthusiastic requests from all walks of life, the National Grand Theater obtained the consent of the Soviet Embassy to publicly screen the film for several days from the 20th to share the fun. The theater has been packed every day, and the value of the film can be imagined. It is heard that as soon as the film is finished screening in Nanjing, it will meet with the people of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Movie Novel</p>
<h3 id="e238">Clive of India (7) <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Mao De</p>
<p>Soon they had another son. They felt that their life was so fulfilling that it could be considered unparalleled. Although Little Clive's physique was very weak, the King of England sent the royal physician, Sir Foulis, to diagnose and treat the child, so they felt that he would soon grow up strong and that tragedy and worry would never befall them.</p>
<p>Although Clive was a soldier, his active and combative nature was not suitable for living in peace. Therefore, he soon wanted to occupy a high position in the domestic officialdom. After military service, warriors often like to dabble in civil affairs, and Clive could not escape this custom. So he joined the election competition for members of parliament. In this election, he seized a huge amount of wealth, wanting to occupy a seat in the parliament. He felt that once he could join the ranks of the parliamentarians, he could fulfill his human duties for the country, for the family, and for himself.</p>
<p>But at this time, disturbances occurred in India again. The new ruler of India, Salaudtudola, colluded with the French and wanted to drive British merchants out of India. At this time, British merchants in India thought of a person again, a warrior who could turn defeat into victory and defeat the enemy with few soldiers. But how could they get his help? The board of directors of the East India Trading Company was holding an important meeting in London at this time. Chairman Sullivan said: "But he is already rich now. Why would he be willing to do that kind of thing? Moreover, he has recently had considerable success in the parliamentary election. He also has a lovely wife and young children. How can we trick him into going back to India?"</p>
<p>One of the resourceful directors, Zhuang Qidong, said: "It is certainly not feasible to trick him out, but we can use a trick to make him willing to come out himself. He is not from a wealthy family, but his behavior is extravagant, no less than a prince. In the election, he has spent almost all his wealth. We only need to find some minor problems in the technical details to prevent him from entering the parliament, then wouldn't he have wasted a lot of money in vain? At that time, we will propose conditions to him. Not only will he have to accept them, but he will also be grateful to us."</p>
<p>Tragedy and worry did come to the home of Clive and Lady Margaret. It was a tragedy that almost neither Margaret Clive nor any woman could bear. One day, Lord Foulis told her that her son had no hope of survival. That might be in a few months, but that was beyond human help. The result was inevitable, but it was only a matter of time. She was feeling grief after hearing the doctor's words, when Clive came back from outside. He said that the position he had won in Parliament had been taken away by others. He sat in his usual chair, holding his head in his hands, the veins on his head bulging. His old head wound always flared up whenever things didn't go his way.</p>
<p>Margaret stood behind him, slowly stroking his head, sprinkling cool medicine on his head from time to time. She was thinking sadly, how could she let him know what the doctor had said? But could she bear these heavy sorrows alone?</p>
<p>After a while, Clive felt calmer and said, "Margaret, your hands are so strange. I think if I didn't have you, what fun would there be in the world?" After a while, he said again, "Margaret, our family is ruined!" Margaret sat down on the small stool next to him and said, "Indeed, I know. But from now on, we can have you at home more often, because..." (To be continued)</p>
<p>Correction: The novel "Clive of India" published on the 20th was paragraph 4, mistakenly made into paragraph 5. The 21st was paragraph 5, mistakenly made into paragraph 6. The 22nd was paragraph 6, mistakenly made into paragraph 7. This is hereby corrected.</p>
