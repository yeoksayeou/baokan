<h2>Page 1</h2>
<p>漢字累國漢文福國何以需要採用新字？</p>
<p>因爲新字，可以立刻掃除文盲，可以容易促進高深文藝。</p>
<p>今日中國民眾，對於天下好些知識與藝術，落後的人數太多，不能應付現在環境與將來，倘不從速設法，迎頭趕上，使多數民眾，添知識，習科學，不久則亡國滅族而變奴隸矣！</p>
<p>或問，中國比之天下各國，歷史最久遠，領土最廣大，地藏最豐富，聖人最多位，文章最妙麗，創造最早有，人民最多數，今日竟然落後，其緣因何在？</p>
<p>中國落後的緣因，由來久矣！就是千百年來「文盲」遍地所造成，（調查報告，謂文盲佔民眾總數八九成）不過從前，閉關自守，其弊不覺，今日遭遇外患，而發現特顯耳。</p>
<p>又問，所謂「文盲」衹「不識字」耳，而對於國家，有何關係？</p>
<p>不識字，則有書不能讀，有書不能讀，</p>
<p>一，則教育不能普及。聖人遺教，寶藏不興，思想顚倒，害人不淺。</p>
<p>二，則科學不能學習。校藝不精進，建設無從起。天賦樂境，也無利用之才。</p>
<p>三，則國語不能統一。感情不團結，羣力無從策。纔有今日之慘狀：內則盜賊如毛，民不聊生。外則受人欺侮，喪失土地。事事墮後，着着輸人。由此可見，文盲關係國家之重要。所以民國以來，熱心國是者，認定「教育」爲振興中國的唯一途徑。而有今日熱烈提倡的，「普及教育」與「統一國語」兩大目的。</p>
<p>文盲之多實因漢字有六大難</p>
<p>欲達以上兩大目的之工具，仍舊採用，現有之漢字，可行乎？</p>
<p>大膽說一句「絕對不可行也」！千百年來，文盲遍地，而致今日國家落後，都爲漢字所累，焉有仍舊採用之理乎？事因漢字，已失其標音之可能性。字體繁難，非經教師逐字口授，與要强記，不爲功。如其不信，試申論之。</p>
<p>一，筆畫雖少，而逐字需要口授與强記者，如「巨叵　臣匝」等字。</p>
<p>二，圈聲異解，而需變讀者，如「好樂，音樂，快樂，善惡，憎惡」等字。</p>
<p>三，俗常誤讀者，如擴充（誤讀礦充）一切（誤讀一竊）旋斡（誤讀旋幹）會計（誤讀滙計）謹識（誤讀謹式）等字。</p>
<p>四，一字數解，而需數讀者，如「率」一字，音蟀將領也。音帥烏綱也。音律稅率也。音類率更也，音刷罰鍰也。</p>
<p>五，同邊旁，而異讀異解者，如「乞吃訖扢　　　籺　犵仡紇疙趷屹阣圪忔迄汔　釳肐虼矻　龁乾亁　」等字。三十字，而有二十二讀音，四十五解釋。</p>
<p>六，筆畫多而難記寫者，如「纔竊鬬灨　釁鹽」等字。</p>
<p>簡單言之，漢字之難，畢生學之不了，記之不盡。所以俗語有云「狀元都怕問字」。再若不信，試問，以漢字教學之歷來成績如何。</p>
<p>一，歷來少年，讀了十年八年的書，識字幾何？至多就算識得三四千字，以後古今書籍中字，都盡識其音讀乎？曾讀之字，以後有無忘記乎？不識之字，檢查字典能得其音乎？傲漢字所造之科學名詞，都能讀乎？</p>
<p>二，作文詞章，通順的有幾人？通文理而曉科學的有幾人？教師不讀錯字音的有幾人？正所謂「十年窗下苦，十年窗下欠功夫」！</p>
<p>三，處比經濟壓迫之下，爲父母者，百人中，能有金錢，供給子女，人學攻書十年八年的，又有幾人？</p>
<p>字學繁難，經濟壓迫，中國民眾，焉有不文盲歟！簡而言之，漢字不去，文盲常在。此豈不是漢字之累國乎？反而言之，漢文一物，則不可同日而語也。吾人心性善良，超於海外者，莫不歸功固有之文化。而固有文化之優美與豐富，莫不藉賴漢文之妙麗。國人得而享之，豈非漢文之福國乎？</p>
<p>二，注音漢字有害無利</p>
<p>所以三十年來，明達之士，認定漢字字體，確實麻煩，非常難學，大大枉費少年的腦力。且誤時日，不能學習甚麼科學技藝。於是，諸般設計，希望改良，而有歷年的種種提倡。</p>
<p>如改用歐洲言文的，世界語的，高麗字母的，日本假名的，官話簡字的，羅馬字拚音的，速記系的，篆文系的，草書系的，象數系的，音義系的，手頭簡字的，注音符號的，注音漢字的，等等不下二十餘家，以期迎頭趕上，達到教育普及。和國語統一，兩大目的。各家熱誠，可稱可頌。惟查各法，不足取者，不論外。至於頒行學習之「注音符號」與「注音漢字」二者對於兩大目的，實在有害。今先就「注音符號」（獨用）而論。注音符號，單寫北平一方之音，不是文字，並無訓義，又無辨別同音字的方法。故</p>
<p>對於「普及教育」有三無用。</p>
<p>一，識漢字，雖不懂北話者，於其平常教育學業，無需學習之必要。</p>
<p>二，懂北話，而不識漢字者，學識符號，拚出之音，粗淺言語，或可通曉。但是稍深雅言，未必明白。若要明白·非兼學漢字不可·</p>
<p>三，不識漢字，又不懂北話者，學識符號，拚出音來，不明語意，於其平常教育學業，完全無用。非兼學漢字不可。</p>
<p>對於「統一國語」亦有三無用。</p>
<p>一，識漢字，而不懂北話者，符號雖可學，以習國語，但不見漢字，亦不曉語意。</p>
<p>二，懂北話，而不識漢字者，無學習之必要。</p>
<p>三，不識漢字，又不懂北話者，學識符號，拚出音來，如聽外國語，非兼學漢字不可。</p>
<p>兼且，符號獨用，連其點聲，在於一頁書面，形同一堆亂草，讀者極爲目眩神昏。</p>
<p>深知諸弊，故推行辦法，有「小學課本，生字注音」之規定。又「國音字典」之設備，冀補符號獨用之不足，且助兼學漢字之便用。詎知此項辦法，雖曾經歷二十餘年，兩大目的，固然不達，而民眾方面，對於其法，殊無興趣，大有隔靴搔癢之歎。何以言之？</p>
<p>細查其法，實際上，難上加難，蓋凡一字，需先教其方音，俾曉字義。後再教國音。如此，對於學習漢字方面，已有五難。譬如一個「樂」字需要强記。</p>
<p>一，其方音。讀落。</p>
<p>二，其解釋。娛樂也。</p>
<p>三，其寫法。樂，十五畫。</p>
<p>四，其圈聲之音，與解。音磽，欲也。音嶽，音樂也。</p>
<p>五，異解而變讀音。如「率」字。音蟀，督領也。音帥，烏綱也。音類，率更也。音律，稅率也，音刷，罰鍰也。</p>
<p>對於兼習國音，再加三難。仍要强記，</p>
<p>一，其拚法與點聲。如樂字。讀「ㄌㄛ」</p>
<p>二，其圈聲之音。如樂字，讀「一ㄠ，一ㄛ」。</p>
<p>三，異解而變讀音。如率字，讀「ㄕㄨ」（ㄕㄨㄞ）</p>
<p>「ㄕㄨㄛ」「ㄌヘ」「ㄌㄩ」「ㄕㄨㄚ」如此，豈不「難上加難」乎？</p>
<p>結果，民眾則偶爾提示，略資點綴，實際上，並不發生效力。因是之故，國語統一委員會，新近再事努力，規定「注音漢字用途」，呈請教部頒行。希冀「符號一熟，文義自明，聲入心通，事半功倍。」以峰愚見，「注音漢字」不獨「難上加難」恐或有害！</p>
<p>注音漢字，參法東瀛，是即，於一漢字之右傍，加附國音符號。又於文告讀物，再加方音符號於左傍。對此問題，亦有不宜採用，四大理由</p>
<p>一，符號目的，不過輔助識讀漢字，有如字典之反切耳。識其音後，則歸無用。何必永世，都要反切，印在記憶耶？</p>
<p>二，其字形，必長體漢字，傍連注音，合成正方。即一字有三部分。學者多數，易於誤會符號，爲一字之部分。兼且，使學漢字，更覺麻煩，而亂記憶。</p>
<p>三，注音符號之醜樣，加附於傍，有傷漢字之美觀，而害讀者之心性。</p>
<p>四，有了符號輔助讀音之倚賴，漢字之音，更難記憶。須知，日本人記憶漢字，比中國人尤難，實因此也。順便一提，對於日本高麗安南三國，峰利用「宗音」與「義種」之妙竅（詳下章）造有專書，教他們離却漢字，採用新字，俾免受漢字加假名，或漢字加注音，兩樣合讀之苦。</p>
<p>有些十數理由。民眾自然覺得，此學漢字。反增麻煩，不見利便，學無興趣，又何怪焉？</p>
<p>注音符號，大都倣從西人拚音方法而造。對於音韻學理，殊無顧及。至其種種倒亂，暫不細論。</p>
<p>頒行注音符號之旨，無疑有欲雙管齊下，使民眾大家，識漢字，曉國語，但是，不得其妙竅，離不了漢字，反增麻煩。民眾視爲畏途，連漢字亦少學幾個。文盲豈不更多，而普及教育，和統一國語，豈不更爲裏足乎？注音符號，和注音漢字，之不足採用，諒已明矣。</p>
<p>對於各家之提倡，認爲都是熱心美意，絕對未存半點譏誚之心。但是，於事關全國同胞的知識教育目的不達，方面着想，又於枉費無辜少年的精神光陰金錢太鉅，方面着想，不得不將自己所見及的缺點提出向大家討論一下，而已。識者諒之。</p>
<p>注音符號，既是的確不能脫離漢字，而漢字又累人文盲，則普及教育，統一國語兩大目的，亦無達到之望。事實如此，不得不另尋途徑。</p>
<p>三，新字優點十數有多</p>
<p>漢字難學，符號有害，若欲雙管齊下，促進民眾大家，通文理，說國語，俾可速習科學技藝，立結全國團體，迎頭趕上，好與外國並駕齊驅，非需創造一種新字，不爲功！</p>
<p>創造新字之議既决，則新字之式體與功用，何者爲適宜，須先研究。漢字字體，雖曰繁難，不易學習，但是其「讀音」與「訓義」兩事，對於習用各國，至今仍未失去，其代表語言之功用。故今新字之創造，應宜循從漢字。但是需要，變其體，而留其用，兼且</p>
<p>一，逐字代替：漢字一個，新字一個。</p>
<p>二，變其體者：新字字體之筆畫，一邊需變作「音部」具有標音（字種拚音）之可能性。一邊需變作「義部」具有訓義（部首解字）之可能性。二者倣六書中之「形聲」一法也。</p>
<p>三，留其用者：新字之「音部」，需要貫通其字現目各處之方音。其「義部」需要表示其字原有之普通訓義。</p>
<p>四，遵守學理：固有之音韻學理，　　需要保存，而昌明之。</p>
<p>五，毛筆描寫：音義兩部並立，結構需要美觀。至於書寫行法，左行右行，以科學理論，久讀必傷一目，仍舊下行，乃合衛生。（此非別國書法所能辦到）五事顧及，方爲適宜。峰本斯五旨，創造此式新字。</p>
<p>峰於，語言，字學，之研究，致力已有二十餘年，今就所得，不避冒昧，貢獻同胞，聊盡國民之義務。民國初立，改革熱狂，峰於是年，造有拚寫北音方法，名曰「中國新字」，後又著有「南北音通」「林峰速記」等書。分送親友，意在提倡改革漢字，促進教育。編著此等書時國，適在英京遊學，暇時無多，參考字學書籍，尤爲欠缺。回國後，再讀古今字學音韻諸書，則覺以前所著者，未能盡合音韻學理，又不適用於各省。於是，重事研究萬餘字各處之讀音。（中國東南西北中外十八處，如廣東，客家，福建，溫州，寗波，北平，揚州，漢口，四川，南京，濰縣，登州，九江，厦門，汕頭，日本，高麗，安南（。千翻萬檢，尋其理路。衹此一事，費有十餘年的工夫，畢竟於重複稽考中，尋得各處讀音，相屬之條理。後按各條理，造出一種，有如代數術之公式，此峰命名爲「宗音」。再將各宗音，化分爲意韸種，尺種，攝種，三類音種（字母）。合之爲一音部。查漢字宗音，計有三千二百餘個，包括所有漢字之各方讀音。（詳見「林峰音譜」）</p>
<p>至於一字之訓義，則倣「六書」之「形聲」法，用一部首，如「金木水火土」之類，附於音部之傍。此峰命名爲「義種」，作爲新字之義部。查康熙字典所有之字，或按「說文解字」之原義，或按常用之意義，可以用五十個義種，分別而歸納之，並無同音同形，相碰之弊。（詳見「林峰字典」）</p>
<p>新字之「音種」計用七十六個。「義種」計用五十個。合共一百二十六個，統稱「字種」錯綜配合，可製八十餘萬字。詳下一覽表。</p>
<p>畢業時期：音種七十六個，半月都可熟記。拚音法理，不識漢字者衹需一月，識漢字者一日，識西文拚音者一時，都可明白，習練兩月後，便可讀書，以及學文學藝。義種之附加法理，需於學文時，曉解字意，陸續便明矣。</p>
<p>本式新字，若施於普及教育與統一國語，收效必速，全國文盲，立刻可掃除。今試略舉新字具有之優點，申而論之。（以下，參看「輪解圖」及「一覽表」）</p>
<p>新字速記公綴三法一覽表</p>
<p>輪解圖</p>
<p>一，結構整齊</p>
<p>新字字體，用音義兩部，並立而成一字。音部用韸，尺，攝，三個音種，一串構成。又義部用義種一個，附近音在部之傍，或在左或在右，總以美觀爲主。每字一律用四個字種，結成正方，不似「符號」有一個或二三個之參差。</p>
<p>二，宗音妙竅</p>
<p>所謂「宗音」者，可謂漢字之古音也，貫通所有用漢字各地之方音。</p>
<p>一，其妙竅之體，在於「音種」之拚法。例如「金」字之音，新字則用</p>
<p>「久　ラ」（基意森）</p>
<p>三個音種而拚成。其拚法：先則「意森」拚成「陰」之韻。然後「基陰」拚成金字之音。</p>
<p>二，其妙竅之用，在於以其同是三個音種，用北音拚之，則成北話。用南音拚之，則成南話。用日本音拚之，則成日本話。不必更換音種。凡字音皆如此。換言之，無論任何省縣，甚至日本，高麗，安南三國，用其方音寫出之字音，其餘別處，都可通曉。有些妙竅，無論各省方音如何複雜，都可採用，以教國音與方音</p>
<p>三，義種妙竅</p>
<p>所謂「義種」者，即是一字之類屬也，訓示一字所指事物，屬何種類。</p>
<p>一，其妙竅之體，在於音部之傍，附加一義種。例如「金」字之義，新字則附加「斤」於音部之傍又如「今」字之義，新字則附加「日」於音部之傍。</p>
<p>二，其妙竅之用，在於（甲）以義種，可以訓示類屬。（乙）以義種，可以辨別同音各字。例如「金今禁襟衿」五個異解而同音之字，新字則寫「　　　　　」</p>
<p>分別而代替之。若不附加義種「斤日亻衤糸」，不能成全替代漢字之功。有些妙竅，無論典籍文理如何高深，都可採用以教文字與文理。合此兩大妙竅，則教文字，連國語，雙管齊下之目的，都可達矣。</p>
<p>四，音義並現</p>
<p>由上兩條看來，可見字體本身筆畫（即字種），一邊可以切出字音，一邊乃是表示字義。雖或生字，例如新字「　　　　」切出字音，便曉其爲「金生麗水」。不必逐字，需要老師口授，與要强記，有些妙竅，則首章之「漢字六大難」亦可迎刃而解矣。試看，</p>
<p>一，無「逐字需要口授與要强記者」之難。</p>
<p>例如：巨叵　臣匝</p>
<p>新字則寫：</p>
<p>二，無「圈聲異解而需變讀者」，之難。</p>
<p>例如　好樂　音樂　快樂　善惡　憎惡</p>
<p>新字同寫：</p>
<p>三，無「俗常誤讀者」之難。</p>
<p>例如：　擴充　廓　一切　砌　旋斡　烏活　會計　瑰　謹識　誌</p>
<p>新字則寫：</p>
<p>四，無「一字數解而需數讀者」之難。</p>
<p>例如：音蟀音帥音律音類音刷</p>
<p>新寫則寫：</p>
<p>五，無「同旁邊而異讀者」之難。</p>
<p>例如：乞去訖切　祈求也　　丘既切　給與也　吃居乙切　言難也　　欺訖切　笑貌也　　欺益切　吃也　犵去逸切　苗子也　虼歌亞切　虼蚤也</p>
<p>新字則寫：</p>
<p>訖居迄切　終止也　扢歌紇切　摩拭也　　戶骨切　義仝上　　居乙切　打擊也　　許訖切　奮舞也　　魚乞切　義仝上　　九傑切　拔引也　　忌乙切　直行也　迄詐訖切　至及也　　溪訖切　幾也</p>
<p>紇下杚切　絲下也　　奚結切　大絲也　　蹇列切　覲見也　　胡骨切　束也　　九傑切　急也　　歌扢切　紇縫也　　下扢切　籺堅麥也　　籺　同　仡魚乞切　勇壯貌　　五忽切　動舟貌</p>
<p>去訖切　香草也　　許乞切　輿也　　忌迄切　義同上　乾渠焉切　易卦名　亁古寒切　水涸也　疙魚乞切　痴貎　　居氣切　義同上　　歌扢切　疙禿瘡　趷歌扢切　趷　也　圪魚迄切　墻高也</p>
<p>屹魚訖切　阣同　上　山危貌　忔許訖切　喜也　　魚乙切　不欲也　釳許迄切　軍器也　　居乙切　魚游也　　俗音矻　瑕疵也　龁下籺切　　也　　戶骨切　義同上　　奚結切　義同上</p>
<p>肐乙力切　胸骨也　　苦本切　禿也　　丘謁切　義同上　　苦骨切　頰起貌　矻苦骨切　勞極也　　丘八切　石堅貌</p>
<p>以上同「乞」旁者，三十字，而有二十二音，四十五解，連同解而不同音者六個，共計五十一個。今以新字五十一個，可以一一分別，而替代。若無音義並現方法，斷難都記清楚。</p>
<p>六，無「筆畫多而難記寫者」之難。</p>
<p>例如：纔　竊　鬬　灨　　　釁　鹽</p>
<p>新字則寫：</p>
<p>五，聲韻顯明</p>
<p>字體標音，聲韻俱現。例如「　　　　」（金錦禁急）衹看攝種「ラ壬心及」，便知一字，係屬何聲何韻，不必翻檢韻書。最便撰作詩詞歌賦之用。聲韻顯明，讀音自然正確</p>
<p>六，新字五易</p>
<p>一，易學。同音種則字同音，學識音種與拚音法後，識一字則同音之字皆識。</p>
<p>二，易解。字有義種，見字曉意。</p>
<p>三，易讀。字有形勢，學過之後，一見認得。</p>
<p>四，易記。音義並現，見字形則識讀者，懂語音則曉寫字，不必强記。</p>
<p>五，易寫。每字平均，約十二畫，雖無「人丁卜大」筆畫之少，而無「鸞鬱籲艷」筆畫之多。一篇文字畫數，統計總少十分之三。</p>
<p>七，字樣美觀　文字一物，起居日用，觸目皆是。美觀之道，關係人生心性極大，故新字之筆畫結構，但皆顧及美觀。</p>
<p>八，學理保存　新字所定之清濁，八等，四聲，韻數，剛柔，種種類別，都有根據，盡合韻書，兼且脗合各省之讀者。</p>
<p>九，最合普教　字標「宗音」，方方都可採用。換言之，字標學者各人所講之方音，便有「聲入心通，見形曉義」之便利。學法：則先用方音，教其七十六個音種。後由「林峰音譜」學習拚音。又由「林峰字典」教其五十個義種之訓示。兩個月學識後，則無字不曉其音讀，無字不曉其意義，又無字不曉其寫作。將來新字繹出的，各科課本，告示規條，國文論說，信札新聞，科學雜誌，無一不可自讀自曉。最全普及教育之用。</p>
<p>十，易學國語　新字所標之「宗音」讀方音可，變讀北音亦可。不懂北話的人，或不識漢字的人，欲學國語，只需如上條，費兩個月工夫，學識用方音，拚調字音，明白字義。然後冉費一個月，將已識之七十六個音種，請師教授，改讀北音，與拚北音法。常識後，則字字的北音，都可說，字意又明白。一箭貫雙鵰，最合統一國語之用。</p>
<p>十一，可注方音　字標宗音則其音部，無論任何省縣，都可用作，標注漢字之方音，不必如注音符號，另加閏母，更改符號。</p>
<p>十二，萬年不變　萬年不變者，謂採用新字，則同音各字，雖萬年以後，不會互相反悖其音讀也。譬如「基箕姬覊機饑」等字，現目全體各字，各省同讀一音。又可貫通北音。若無新字之「音種」固定其音讀，難保將來，各字不目讀一音。今後新字，同音讀則同音種，將來語音，無論如何遷變，同音之字，只可全體同變，永不會互相反悖其音讀也。又不會搗亂「宗音」貫通方音之妙竅，而使全國不能統一語言矣。</p>
<p>十三，是國際語　新字標音，易於學習。决定北音，可作國際語之用。</p>
<p>一，以其人數言。中國，日本，高麗，安南，四國，合共約五萬萬餘，幾佔世界人類，三分之一。</p>
<p>二，以其字體言，字屬單音單義，最便製造名詞，與撰作詩詞歌賦之用。試看「千字文」一冊之包容，可以不重一字而編成。此非別國文字所能辦到者也。</p>
<p>三，以其功用言。此之別式國際語，北音是天然生活之語言，不是人造無味之呆話。兼且，漢文經典豐富，語法簡潔，又無西文語尾之搏束。</p>
<p>十四，排字便捷　字種一百二十六個，可分字粒，總盛於一盤，排字甚爲便捷。可省尋覓漢字之煩。又可將之用機打字。</p>
<p>十五，利用無限　按照宗音之妙竅，另造有，速記，公綴（即羅馬字拚音）打電，打旗，打燈，瞽讀，啞語等書，法效宗音，方方都可通曉。又羅馬字音種之次第，幾成世界普通，今新字排列，亦宜依之，將來種種字典名冊，目錄表列，中西對照，檢查方面，便捷異常。又新字字種，可以用於，繙譯或製造，科學新名詞。其利用誠無限量。</p>
<p>由上各優點看來，新字全有漢字之功用，而加之有，字標音義，易於普教，貫通國語，易於統一，各大妙竅，比之漢字與符號，豈不適用百倍乎？</p>
<p>尤有進者。中國人人，都需學習新字。</p>
<p>一，平民男女，沒有多少時間與金錢，當然要學，因爲衹費兩三個月的時間，就可學識，以後對於讀書，寫信，與及工業課本，便可習讀。</p>
<p>二，識得漢字，會說國語者，仍需要學。所謂「識得漢字者」，試問他們，降篆字不計外。對於漢字典籍中之古體，如「無泰罪次」之「　　辠　」，與科學新創之名詞。如「蜻鍺鈰硅」等字，都能認識乎？又近世讀書，遠不如古人之兼學五藝：禮樂射御數。現目多數，甚至政界，也不過識得三四千字，或者作文通順而已。而對於世界常識，科學藝術，甚至普通算術地理，少有知曉。知識如此缺乏，何得謂之「全民」只「雛民」而已！又所謂「會說國語者」除北平讀書人外，對於稍深文字，也不識正確的國音。二者皆歸咎，漢字難學之所累也。但是，學了兩三個月的新字後，則無論任何古今書籍，一經新字譯出，都是音義並現，便可曉讀，與乎學習矣。</p>
<p>一字之音，關係讀書，求知識之興趣，非常重要。讀漢字的書，常常碰到有不認得之字，讀書就覺煩厭，不樂得再讀下去。讀新字之書，無字不曉其音，讀書則易如拾芥，兼且津津有味，更進一句。一字之音，猶如一人一物之名，不識其名，說話就不明白。兼且，即雖見過數次，而於作文時，亦不想起來用。聖人說得好，「名不正，則言不順」。今若趕緊，選出古今的有用書籍，用新字譯出，則全國民眾，好容易地，學習高深文藝：古有的，哲理嘉言，妙麗文章，近代的世界知識，科學技藝。</p>
<p>或謂，漢字之應用，具有深長之歷史，驟以新字，易而代之，終或窒礙難行。是說也，乍聽之，似覺近情。細思之，實屬不智。詎知</p>
<p>一，以其應用而論。須知，楷書現目，衹應一二成雛民之用而已。而對於其餘民眾，猶如篆書一樣，均是不識不用。歷史之深長與否，有何關焉？况且，譬諸今日頒行新字，以教大眾，而雛民仍有漢字可用，亦不至有何牽累。夫文字之爲物，以供記錄事物，覓尋知識。描表情感，互相通訊之用，猶如工匠之器具，當以多人識用，以及便利爲主。用漢字，千百年來，衹造得一二成雛民，而難於增添知識。用新字，三兩個月，能盡除文盲，而易於深造文藝。試問，一二成之用多歟？抑八九成之用多歟？天演公理，優勝劣敗，吾怕將來，用新利器者八九成都變全民，而雛民者一二成，反爲落後。復而言之，今若頑固不改，豈非爲顧少數，而誤多數，仍留文盲遍地，置國家於無振興之地耶？</p>
<p>二，以其書籍而論。試問，已往出版者多歟？抑將來出版者多歟？今日不改，積累更深，豈非後世子孫，永遠不能脫離讀書認字之苦耶？爲今之計，可以趕緊，繙譯應用書籍，而所懷疑之困難，亦可立解矣。至於現有之漢字書籍，可以如昔日之甲骨全文籀篆等等，置諸博物院，以供古學研究家之玩索，亦無不可。</p>
<p>三，以其字體而論。有史以來，蝌蚪文，金文，甲文，奇字，大篆，小篆，繆篆，刻符，鳥蟲書，摹印，習書，殳書，隸篆，左書，中古文，詛楚文，飛白書，八分，楷書，行書，草書，蘭筆俗字。可見字體，不是呆板，總求便利爲主。究諸古籍，斑斑可考。今若採用新字，即換新利器而已。况且，本式新字之變，非改漢字之語音與其文理，惟仍存其功用與美觀。所變者，不過將漢字之筆畫，變成「形聲」耳。此亦「六書」之舊法，漢字八九成之體劃也。峰敢直說，非特無損於古學，且愈足以葆存，而昌明之也。竊思。數千年來之漢字難關，一旦爲新字打破，非敢矜誇爲大創造，惟於國民將來進化，或者補助不少。</p>
<p>四，促進普教成人宜始</p>
<p>今欲促進「普及教育，與統一國語」之收效，應宜從政界官員，與四十以下成人，爲始。</p>
<p>一，以昭敬信。諺語有云「上尤下效」，申言之，在官不學，在民無敬。爲父不學，爲子無信。既無敬信，焉有樂從，注音符號之失敗，莫不因此。</p>
<p>二，以易長全。現目成人，略識漢字，急民也矣，羽翼半出，容易長成全民。或面授，或自修，三兩個月，便可學識。</p>
<p>推行新字辦法，大概應宜。</p>
<p>一，强迫全國民眾，四十歲以下者，尤其政界官員，一律學習新字，三兩個月。</p>
<p>二，公眾讀物：如告示，規條，報紙等等，另外添印，新字專刊。</p>
<p>三，小學初級課本，獨印新字。初級以上的課本，亦另外添印新字本。</p>
<p>四，劃一國音之標準。在北平，設一「國音師範學校」，選擇口音清正之北平人，不收學費，以一年計劃，約需一萬元，訓練一千師範，分四期畢業，陸續派往各縣（薪金由各縣負擔）分設「國音師範學校」再產師範，以供各校之用。如此，方有劃一之標準。北平師範之設，俾學國音者，得其字音正確。現目，各方所說之國語，學校所教之國音，幾乎全數，是方音和北音混雜，成爲一種軋轢響聲，不是正確北平音韻。若决以北音爲國音而欲統一，必須用北平人口授，否則，漫無標準，各自爲政，豈不反增千百種，不論不類之字音乎？果以政府之力，頒行全國，峰敢斷言，師到之處，三個月後，文盲盡除。然後普及教育，統一國語，兩大工作，可以推行無滯矣。三年後，全國大眾都成全民，一勞永逸，豈不快哉！</p>
<p>五，急公好義尤爲俊傑</p>
<p>但是，對於急公義舉，不需政府强迫，而能眾力自動者，尤爲俊傑。因此，暫住上海，設一「新字譯書館」籌備處，徵求熱心愛國同志，招集資本，舉辦下列事項爲之實行提倡。</p>
<p>一，訓練「新字師範」（各省人）以備各省聘任。科目：新字連音韻學理，及或速記，學費：每科每月五元。書籍在內。畢業：每科三月。合格畢業。得領文憑。經費：以教師一人教授五十學生，薪金每月一百元。</p>
<p>二，遣派師範（北平人）至各省縣，宣傳新字功用，與教授北平正音，俾得國音，有劃一之標準，先派四十人，以兩個月爲期，每人至十縣。薪金旅費，平均每人五百元。總共經費，預備二萬元。</p>
<p>三，編譯書籍，例如學校課本，聖賢哲理，科學知識，小說新聞，以及種種有用書籍，陸續譯出，以供全國之用，繙譯員：擬用十人，每人每月薪金一百元。營業計劃：今以師範，到處宣傳與推銷，則生必暢。此項獲利，將來大有可觀。薪水印費雜項，預備二萬元。以上三種事實，將來給人以新職業者，爲數不少。此亦爲挽救民生之一開源也。有些「寓教於商」之運動，則普及教育與統一國語，兩大目的，必然指日，便可成功。</p>
<p>四，購置房屋一所，在北平，命名「新字譯書館」，一以作同志愛國熱誠之紀念。二以應學校編譯之需用。預備價値一萬元。</p>
<p>本館資本，擬招五萬元爲額，分作一千股，每股五十元。售書溢利，將之按股分派。股友台銜，將之刻諸館內紀念碑，全數一人擔任，尤爲歡迎。</p>
<p>凡各同志，有欲贊助者，請先函知，認股數目。一俟認足時，當即招集股友，組織理事會，并訂章程，註冊爲「有限公司」。然後收股，進行開辦。</p>
<p>凡有所襄助此舉者，如建議推行辦法，或批評學術，無任歡迎領教。</p>
<p>注意：本處不設招股募捐分處代理。</p>
<p>通訊處：上海郵局信箱第五零二號。</p>
<p>籌備處現設「新字速記學校」先辦函授，以便有志者向學。章程：函索并附郵二分即寄。</p>
<p>六，振興急務愛國踴躍</p>
<p>總而言之，對於振興車之途徑，用新字，比用漢字與注音符號，既有如乘航空，與走陸路之比例，方法敏捷，又是文字，且可用於永遠，則一採用林峰新字，爲振興中國之第一捷徑一之號召，諒不爲謬也。</p>
<p>今者。惟願熱心愛國同胞，</p>
<p>一，爲多數平民計。不費多少錢財，與時間，便可享受教育之利益：明覺聖賢明德，學習科學技藝，改善生活程度。</p>
<p>二，爲後世子孫計，免使他們將來讀書，捱受長期之辛勞。又不使　蹈故轍，文盲遍地，累國累民。</p>
<p>三，爲高深知識計。用新利器，方可容易讀書，然後津津有味，追求無厭。文藝智識，自然日日高深。</p>
<p>四，爲振興國家計。須知，國家興盛，內可安居樂業，不爲奴隸。外可自由平等，而有權威。惟欲享此幸福，非有文化與物質之建設，爲不可，而求兩大建設，非從讀書與技藝之增進，更不可。</p>
<p>大家應當，立刻猛醒。踴躍贊助，新字之進行。齊起掃除，文盲之累國，從此，埋頭苦幹，多讀古今書籍，守禮義，添智識，習科學，說國語，成爲全民。同時，切實覺悟，團結國體，羣策羣力，迎頭趕上，振興中國，進入「國泰民安」之樂境，是誠峰之厚望焉。</p>
<p>民國二十四年七月十日　子峰林峰謹識</p>
<p>林峰書目：新字字典二元，音義八角，新字千字文三角，音譜，速記，新字，公綴，以上每冊五角。</p>

<p>救災如救焚。言其急也辦賑無善策。言其艱也。嘗見民國二十年長江大水。災民蔽江而下。滬上仕女。出其金錢。供以食餌。濟以衣履。多無待勸募而踴躍輸將。乃至災民流連忘返。遣之不去。惻隱悲憫。見義勇爲之精神。可謂偉矣。及去年大旱爲災。赤地千里。受災之衆。不讓二十年。但大衆贊助之忱。視前爲遜。豈人情之冷暖。今昔大殊乎。所以若此者。蓋爲無年無災。賑不勝賑。懈其注視之力。一也。傾囊相助。可一再而不可數四。常則力有不足。愛莫能助。二也。農村破產。都市衰落。自顧不遑焉能顧人。三也。今者江水甫吿安瀾。黃水又見氾濫。旱區災民之喘息未蘇。水區災民已接踵而來。辦賑旣動需巨欵籌賑則乞貨無門。而棲息於烈日之下。積水之中。水深火熱之災民。方徘徊於死亡綫上。盼援於飢餓道中。此情此景。寧非淒絕人寰耶。</p>
<p>聞賑濟辦法。經過六日院議。已有具體决定。大致工賑部分。由各被災省市就原有工程。盡量容納災民。農賑急賑則由中央救災準備金項下動支百萬辦理。並申令各省政府。每年由經常預算收入總額內。支出百分之二。爲各該省救災準備金。然中央卽撥鉅欵。而災區遼闊。待濟者衆勢難普及。故欲救災民。惟有靠大衆之力量耳。　然則如何能得大衆之援助乎。愚以爲官傳因要。但宣傳至於今日。已成強弩之末。蓋人人皆知其爲宣傳而宣傳也。今欲得人之信任。自惟有尚實行。所謂實行者無他。處處與人以共見。不尚辭飾。而能實事求是做去也。吾人固知主持賑務者大都辦賑有年。素負價譽。或處理工賑。卓著成效。但爲脤務本身着想。對於辦事首貴得人之義。仍不憚於煩言。蓋欵不虛糜。實惠及民。爲辦賑之最大原則。使衆共信。得衆扶助。又爲辦賑之唯一條件。此二者皆視辦事之得人與否以爲斷。查賑於賑監工人員。如皆具有熱烈之情感。純潔之操守。耐勞之精神。則事必有濟。反之。胃賑吃賑侵肥朦混之弊生。而又徇私隱蔽。不加懲處。則人之信仰以失。後繼豈不爲難。吾人嘗於報章得見各善團嗚謝捐欽之廣吿矣。其收支內容如何。誰有徵信報吿之類。迄無有與人共見之隨會。在捐欵奢固以爲欵已捐出。我心已盡。其他非所欲問。而在辦事者理應盡其責任昭示大。信不但使捐欵者得知其所捐之欵作何處置。亦當使大衆知其所收所支。確是眞實不虛。個個爲災民而用。則大衆對之。自深其信仰。後此如有動作。樂於捐助。無所吝惜。或謂帳目浩繁不勝登載。此則近於託辭矣。一級收支準確之簡明對照表。編製何難。亦何所靳面不爲乎。</p>
<p>募捐不可名目太多。多則人或疑爲假名斂錢矣。不可繁苛。繁苛則近於勒捐矣。不可爲人利用作宣傳。一經利用人或恐其非正當矣。募捐之機關人選宜慎。欵項捐册之審核宜明。否則弊將業生。信譽掃地矣。吾聞辦理慈善專業者。類皆有宗教之信仰。若能發慈悲救人之宏願。以身作則。廣勸世人。利他卽所以自利。逆料收效必宏。惜乎當今社會。慈善家尚多所顧忌而不肯爲耳。</p>

<p>本月三日、法租界三號碼頭大古公司盛京餘船啟椗時、繼葉轉動、勿翻起女屍一口名張金林、年四十八歲、常經水巡捕將屍帶至甫碼頭救生局、報請地方法院派員騐明、並經屍屬張周氏認明棺殮、一面奉首席監察官鍾尙斌密飭正副警長張樹平·陳錫匯·帶山願爲證人之郝忠陽、並水巡捕房探員等、先後拘獲禇福慶（即朱福慶、）喬蓮堂·喬戚氏·等</p>
<p>男婦三名口、立解到院、中謝濂檢察官訊供制押候究、各情屬誌本報、自此幕慘劇發生之後、社會頗爲注意、茲將調查所得、續讀於後、按死者張金林、係本地人、乃父在日、曾任怡豐洋行及怡和洋行買辦多年、經濟頗爲寬裕、死者於二十歲出閣妝奮豐富、迄未生育、不幸至二十九歲時、所天病歿、因夫家終鮮叔伯、又乏兒女、</p>
<p>後顧茫茫於是有人爲之作伐、轉醮與五馬路開設府綢莊之孟某爲室、賃屋同居、極爲相得、因並不生育、所以領養一女孩（今年十歲、現在山東孟家撫養、）於民國二十二年間、該府綢莊因營業失敗、孟某無意經營、遂將府綢莊出盤與人、盂某挈同張金林及女孩等、同返山東原籍、奈孟某性喜漁色、原籍雖有髪妻、復納一年甫十七隨之北京女子爲妾、異常寵愛、將死者視若奴隸、</p>
<p>悲苦萬狀今年廢歷四月間、孟某命死者隨同親戚某姓發起隴海傳道、死者乃乘隙來輪來滬、隨身僅携帶短衫褲兩性、及藤箱一只、內有山東饅首兩個半、及龍蝦乾半隻、又隨身帶有金鋼鑜戒一只、藍嵌寶圈一付、金手表一只、現洋數元、別無所有其鑽戒等死者在山東時緊藏身畔、輕易未曾取出、據云、因並未取得川資、因此在隴海地方將翡眾銅鈿鐲一只、質洋十三元、以二無半購得、</p>
<p>籐箱一只俾便儲藏衣物、其饅首龍蝦等、係在山東購買、以備中途充饑、迨抵上海、其饅首已堅硬如鐵、無能下咽、死者抵風後、即至城內小世界東首恒德里二號姨母張周氏家、（死者爲張周氏之胞姊所生、）暫居、而死者憶及昔年在申時、有開設木梳店之紹興人褚福慶、曾向渠借去洋二千元、當時立有借摺一扣、（其借摺留存山東孟家、）歷年本利無着、於是死者一再前向褚福慶</p>

<p>作爲廢摺特此登報聲明、張林記白、）死者旋將登報底稿、倩人閱看、始知受愚、於是經人介紹某律師進行訴訟、請追此項借欵、簽立委任狀、言明公費為四百四十元、正在進行中、慘劇突然發生、出事之日、死者係在姨母張周氏家吃夜飯之後、約九時光景、死者擬向小世界屋頂乘凉、而張周氏以家中頗爲凉爽、佝必定須出外納凉、向之阻止、詎死者答以片刻即回、言畢即出、不料竟成永訣、當晚</p>
<p>死者未回張周氏亦不以為意、（按張周氏之胞弟、即死者之胞叔、住居租界、家道小康、平時死者或住姨母家、或居胞叔處、但死者胞叔頗不直死者之行爲、以夫死再蘸、有玷門楣、所以死者雖至叔家、與叔不交一語、）直至第三天、閱見本埠各日報登載浦中發現女屍、所載死者服色、頗似甥女模樣、急向救生局認明、果爲失踪之甥女、現法院中對於此案、頗爲愼重、嚴密偵訊、務期無杆無縱、</p>

<p>— （謝仲文）</p>
<p>平凡被人輕視，特殊受人欽羨，這是由於世界上平凡的人平凡的事太多，而特殊的人特殊的事太少之故。</p>
<p>當老百姓守窮是平凡，作官發財便是特殊：穿布衣吃糙米飯是平凡，錦衣玉食便是特殊。</p>
<p>然而無平凡便顯不出特殊，特殊原自平凡中出來。沒有老百姓，那裏來的官？沒有穿布衣吃糙米飯的人去工作，又那裏來的錦衣玉食？可見平凡不應該被人輕視，特殊有時也要貶低它的價値。</p>
<p>正因爲平凡的人太多，他們才是搆成社會的眞正份子；正因爲平凡的事太多，它們才是社會生活的主要部分。平凡原來是應該重視的！</p>
<p>平凡是主宰，特殊是附庸。</p>
<h3 id="c135">賑災 <a href="#c135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— 羅正</p>
<p>做中國人眞是不幸，一年人禍，一年天災；水災纔過旱荒接着又來了，亢旱剛免，大水却又來到。今年在初夏的時候，我們誰都逆料又將要成旱荒了，而誰知沒有多少天的霪雨便呈了大水之象；山洪暴發，潰堤决口，許多地方全成了澤國。人畜飄流，廬舍蕩然，數千萬的災黎無家可歸。呼援叫救之聲，令人慘不忍聞。</p>
<p>現在有幾位熱心公益的大慈善家，最近爲了賑災的事，已晋京去參加賑務會議討論辦法了，而同時政府方面，亦已由財部撥出巨大欵額來分配救濟。雖然這些於那數千萬的災民遠是盃水車薪，然而倒底也可暫免飢餓，在那些災民正不啻是喝到了一滴甘露呢。</p>
<p>可是上海是天堂，住活在上海的人們永遠是那麼幸福的，水災旣與他們無關，旱荒也和他們不涉；總之，什麽天災，什麼人禍，全不會加到他們的頭上的，所以他們始終不會想到地獄下的人們的苦難。但是我總希望他們對這一幅一幅的慘象圖展開來看看，如果大家還有一份天良的話，那麽也應該將那享樂之資節約些下來，去救救那無數無家可歸，無衣蔽體，無食充飢的難民，免得他們成爲遍野的哀鴻，道傍的餓殍！</p>
<p>不過我對於賑災的辦法却也有一些芻見，要想貢獻給負責辦賑的當局：就是首先應該革除對於過去辦理不完善的劣點。一方面須要視察災區情形散放，另一方面却要嚴厲的防止有人從中舞弊，募多少下來應當散放多少，除去必要的用度外，不能有一文錢的浪費；這纔能够使得有錢的人願意踴躍輸將，而那些災民也得到了實惠。</p>
<h3 id="c136">水 <a href="#c136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— 茱英</p>
<p>水，在這世界上，除了一望無垠的沙漠地之外，隨處都有的，似乎是最是沒甚希罕的，所以一般人對於水，似乎都覺得是再也平淡不過的東西。但是水却實在是對於我們的人生，關係最大的東西。</p>
<p>讀者可還記得麽？在去年夏天，東南數省，滴雨不下，農田龜裂，有幾處竟旱得禾苗都枯槁了，顆粒無收。在那時期裏，在旱區的鄉間，每一個池塘湖沼裏，都給農民們，把最後的一勺水，也用水車踏着，或用噴浦吸着，灌到了農田裏去，想維持一下全家生命之所寄的禾苗的生命。就是那些通流活水，也一天一天的給農民們吸得水位逐漸地低落下去，低落得輕儎的船兒，都會把船底吻着了河底。試想在那時候，「水」是多麽地有價値呀？「水」，對於農民，間接的不只是僅對於農民，幾乎是超乎生命的無價之寶。</p>
<p>但是，一水」對於人類，也不一定是有價値的，有時是被認爲人類之大害。已往的歷史事件且不說，就以最近日本九州的被大風雨侵襲，我們的長江流域的江流泛濫瞧來，「水」的別一副嘴臉，一般人也該深刻地認識的了。</p>
<p>不錯，「水」是超乎人類生命的無價之寶，可是有時是會給人們詛咒着的。這是甚麽道理呢？唔，「水一雖是再也平淡不過的東西，但在實際上，也是不能跳出「求」與「供」的經濟的支配律的呀。</p>

<p>枯柴的人形，漸漸地停止抽搐，終於死了，他是個餓鬼。</p>
<p>『咦！死啦！做做好事吧』！坐在蘆蓆上的女子，對那旁邊男子屍身看了一眼在哀求人圈里的許多人。</p>
<p>『啊！眞是個餓鬼』。</p>
<p>『够怕人的，你瞧：像是骨綳着皮的人架子了』。</p>
<p>『啊！畢竟是可憐的』。</p>
<p>人圈里是有許多的人，但；只表同情並不肯救濟，而且眼看着這個人嚥氣。</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>我一夜原是輪到値宿，雖因伊老人家的煩惱已除，可以不用再愁慮，只是一來坐在地板上，根本上不容易睡熟，二來心上記掛着明天淸早要出去游湖的事，便越發不能合眼了：便逼樣朦朦朧朧的一直支持到第三天的淸早。這裏所說的淸早，眞是一些不含糊的，大約在三四點鐘模樣，太后和其餘的人全都起身了；及至大家收拾齊整，蜂擁似的跨上太后的那艘御卅，慢慢地打昆明湖上浮動的時候，距離太陽上升，也還有好一會咧！今天，太后所用的一張御座，比較上是很高的安在船頭的中央：後面呢，排着許多小型的矮凳，供給我們幾個女官憇坐。我們的船還是用竹桿撐着，絕不倚側地慢慢的望昆明湖的北部蕩去：在那裏，荷花是種得最濃密的一部份，荷葉田田，看去彷彿是在水面上舖下了一張綠色的地氈一樣。接着，太后就很溫柔地說道：</p>
<p>「把這船停往了吧！大家靜靜地候着，看着，聽着！」</p>
<p>這時候的情景，可說是很有些神秘的意味：在東面的遠處，雖然已有一部份的天空很悅目地煊染着一重長色了但太陽的頭，却還躱在下面不曾探出來；灰褐色的夜，正在逐漸向西移去，把它佔據着的地位，一些些的交割出來；有幾縷黑色的雲烟，裊裊地曳在半空，如同夜之神所繫的衣帶一樣：許多的翠鳥，在我們的兩邊飛翔着，但並不歌唱，似乎在靜悄悄地享賞着淸晨的天籟。（三八五）</p>

<h3 id="c141">露天電影塲回憶錄 <a href="#c141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>— 上海通社</p>
<p>又是一年一度的時機，跑馬塲影戲院，花園電影塲，滄洲飯店花園影戲塲，相繼爲點綴這個大都會的夏令出現了。這裏，分析了一件事，這三處露天電影塲可別爲兩類：第一類是花園電影塲，它今年是按例開放，因爲前幾年的夏天它亦出過塲的；第二類則是另兩處，大概一般愛跑新鮮去處的遊客們，對於它們是留下了一九三五年的特別印象了。</p>
<p>於是携來了一個小小的問題，前些年代的露天電影塲是些怎樣的分布情形，如果提起來也許使今日的夜遊者驀地憶起舊遊的境地來吧？上海通社於是翻開羊皮書，用鵝毛筆寫它的答案—</p>
<p>一九二四年是上海開始有露天電影塲的年份。「消夏影戲塲」，在靶子路，是這新鮮玩意兒的開路先錄。同年，有聖喬治露天影戲閉幕，在靜安寺路底聖喬治飯莊的花園裏；這時候，董漢生氏經營的公共租界內唯一路綫的公共汽車的起點就在聖喬治門口，想留心交通情形者尙能追憶。聖喬治露天影戲院的後台老板是那時赫赫有名的愛普廠影戲院，實力雄厚，選片精審，消夏影戲塲吃不住它的壓迫，到了第二年就沒有影踪了。然而現在聖喬治飯店旣已易主，愛普廬亦久已落伍而消滅，往事前塵，徒令人惘然追憶而已。</p>
<p>市塲上永遠競爭着。一九二五年的夏天，聖喬治方以戰勝消夏影劇場的姿熊復出現，大華露天影戲園亦挾了上海大戲院之台老板來成爲它的勁敵了，這一處新的露天銀官是在戈登路大華飯店內的意大利花園裏；環境比之於聖喬治花園，殆爲銖　悉稱。大華飯店的地方原來是麥邊花園，素以偉麗有聲海上，一九二四年爲人買去，改作旅店，錫名大華。一九三一年秋，大華飯店出售拆卸，基待價而潔，却是至今未有問津者；地面經工部局乘時開闢大華麥邊兩路，成十字形，倒已成名了。從大華飯店的啟幕以至拆卸之先，大華露天影戲園楚年年夏令準時開放給觀衆的。</p>
<p>花園電影塲開在霞飛路拍球總會的一大片草地上，是法租界唯一的露天電影塲，今年也敞開着歡迎人們進去。它開始是在一九三二年，可是拍球總會草地上有露天銀宮却非起源於一九三二年：當一九二六年的夏季，這片草地曾爲凡爾登露天影戲院用過。追溯根源，拍球總會這一處所，柘是德國花園，歐戰中被法人沒收，改爲公園，名字呌凡爾登，至了一九二六年，才又變做了法國拍球總會的新會址。有人稱那兒呌法商新球塲，是這個緣故；一九二六年的那個影院叫凡爾登，也是這個緣故。</p>
<p>明瞭過去的艱難與繁榮，知道了現在的價値；上海通社於是　起它的羊皮書了。</p>

<p>我今天報告的是正在開始實施的義務教育、義務教育的意義、就是國家用法律來規定全國學齡兒童（指六歲到十二歲的兒童）必須受到最低限度的教育、在國家方面說、辦理義務教育是對於人民應盡的義務、人民來享受這種教育可算是一種權利、國家對於這種教育為增進健全的人民、為提高國民的資格、所以含有強迫的意義、歐美多數文明的國家都定有法律來懲罰不遵守的人民、</p>
<p>我國民智蔽塞、急應施行義務教育、早為一般人所注意、但因政治未入軌道、經濟十分困難、致使關心教育的人無法着手、孫總理也曾說過「……凡在自治區域之少年男女、皆有受教育的權利、學費書籍以及學童的衣食、當由公家供給、」他又說、「……社會主義學者主張教育平等、凡是社會上的人無論貧賤、皆可入公共學校、不特不取學膳等費、即衣履書籍、費用亦由公家担负、盡人民的聰明才力、分習各科……」可見我國義務教育的需要、早為先知先覺的人所注意、但是今日國內之社會情形、民窮財盡、教育享有權僅為最少數人所獨佔、最大多數赤貧子女、他們受教育的權利已被經濟壓迫剝奪殆盡、所以最大多數的國民、目不識字、毫無知識、他們生活在浪漫·頹唐·懶惰·污穢的生活裹、不但不知振拔、反視為當然、這樣的國民、如何能和他們談到行使民權、何能談到共同担负起救國救亡的責任呢、</p>
<p>今日中國內則人禍天災層見疊出、外則強鄰日逼、國勢佔危到了萬分、處在這個非常時代、救亡與圖存、是整個民族的責任、也是我們整個民族的生死關頭、我們為應自己生存的需要、為應付國際惡劣的環境、只有自己覺悟自己找到生存的路上前進、圖生存的重要條件、只有培養健全的國民、使整個民族人人具有適於生存的普通知識、增加他們必須要的生活能力、要使這個目的能夠達到我們就應該大家努力向掃除文盲的道路上進行、要將輾轉在苦難中和苟延殘喘中討生活的中華民族、用教育的力量陶冶他、使他從不知不覺變為已知已覺、從老大病夫世人所輕視的民族、進而為嶄新的中華民族、這是我們應有的努力、也是起死回生的妙劑、</p>
<p>這次政府下最大的決心以全力計劃推行義務教育、在政府固屬應盡的義務、但是民智未開、經費有限、還得全國人民共同努力、各人盡一己的能力去幫助、使能「按步就班循着規定」順利進行、達到最後目的纔好、</p>
<p>假定中國人口總數為四萬萬、以十人中有一學齡兒童計、全國應有四千萬學齡兒童、據二十年度初等教育統計、全國小學兒童數為一千一百六十餘萬、失學學齡兒童、約有三千萬、在學兒童僅佔學齡兒童百分之廿三、可見推行義務教育的重要、何況在這內憂外患交迫的時候、一般國民、都不能受到最低限度之國民教育、那麼無論說到政治建設、物資建設、都是空勞無補的事情、</p>
<p>我們國民黨深切了解這點、所以在第四屆中央執行委員會第五次全體會議議決實施義務教育標本兼治等案、教育部曾經遵照頒布第一期實施義務教育辦法大綱暨短期義務教育實施辦法大綱、令飭各省市主管教育機關遵照施行本年復製定實施義務教育暫行辦法大綱及民國二十四年度中央義務教育經費支配辦法大綱、頒發各省市主管教育機關遵照辦理、並令擬具詳細計劃報部備核、現在我將這種實施義務教育暫行辦法以及經費等項摘要報告、尚希望全國同胞共同襄助進行、</p>
<p>一、義務教育之目的</p>
<p>義務教育應遵照中華民國教育宗旨及其實施方針、切合國民實際生活的需要、要注意到民族意識和國家觀念之養成、使全國學齡兒童（指六歲至十二歲之兒童而言）於十年期限內逐漸由受一年制二年制達於四年制的義務教育、</p>
<p>二、強迫入學及緩學免學辦法</p>
<p>在普通小學及短期小學已夠收容當地學齡兒童的地方、凡身體健全的學齡兒童、必得入普通小學或短期小學、</p>
<p>至於學齡兒童或有疾病或有其他一時不能入學之原因者、得由其家長或保護人具結請求緩學、倘因有痼疾不堪受教育者、其家長或保護人可以具結請求免學、</p>
<p>凡　入學而不入學的兒童、應對其家長或保護人、予以一定期限之書面勸告、限他必定就學、不然、就將其姓名榜示示　、倘若還不遵守、得由縣市教育行政機關請由縣政府處以一元以上五元以下之罰金、並仍限期入學、前項罰金、仍作辦理義務教育的用途、</p>
<p>三、施行義務教育的程序</p>
<p>各省市應在民國二十四年度、令飭所屬縣市、依原有鄉村城鎮人口、劃定小學區、辦理短期小學、每一小學區平均以約有人口一千人為標準、每五小學區至十小學區內、須逐漸設置普通小學一所、行政院直轄市亦同、</p>
<p>據各省市報告、預算本年應辦短期小學六萬校以上、但因經費籌措為難、實際能確實設立者與預定數必當稍遜、但據近日統計至少當有四萬校、假定每校容學生一百人、可以救濟失學兒童四百萬、</p>
<p>義務教育之實施分三期進行</p>
<p>第一期　自民國二十四年八月起至二十九年七月止為第一期、在這期內一切年長失學兒童和未入學之學齡兒童至少應受一年的義務教育、各省市為供給兒童受一年的義務教育起見、應興辦下列各事、</p>
<p>（一）推廣短期小學　限令各小學區就預定設校地點、設置一年制之短期小學、招收九足歲至十二足歲的失學兒童、這項小學以採用二部編制為原則、每日上下午各教學半日或全日開時教學、至少各授課三小時或四小時、修業年限為一年、鄉村短期小學得放農忙假、普通小學及其他學校與公共機關內、並得附設前項短期小學班、</p>
<p>（二）改良私塾　限令各地將原有私塾、整理改良、一律依照短期小學或普通小學課程辦理、改稱改良私塾、其較優者、得改為短期小學或普通小學、</p>
<p>試行巡迴教育　令地方設置巡迴教員、輪往窮鄉僻壤交通不便利處、教授失學兒童、其程度與短期小學同、在本期末年、務使曾受一年短期小學教育或相當教育之兒童至少達到學齡兒童總數百分之八十、</p>
<p>第二期　自民國二十九年八月起至三十三年七月止為第二期、在這期內一切學齡兒童至少應受兩年義務教育、各省市　將各學區內　有一年制之短期小學、漸漸都改為二年制短期小學招收八足歲至十二足歲之失學兒童、還是採用二部編制的原則、修業年限一年、在本期之末年、曾受一年短期小學教育或相當教育之兒童至少亦須達到學齡兒童總數百分之八十、</p>
<p>第三期　自民國三十三年八月起為第三期、義務教育期間定為四年、應將各地之二年制短期小學、漸改為四年制之普通小學、第二·第三兩期內、對於改良私塾、試行巡迴教育都應繼續辦理、（未完）</p>

<p>— 美國奧爾珂德女士原著鄭曉滄（宗海）譯</p>
<p>「他會弄　的，不是嗎？」乃德問，其時韜摩卻已不能講話，因為他剛把一個蒸熟的蘋果塞進嘴裹去了。</p>
<p>韜摩只得點頭示意，可是不知怎的，一會兒，他居然便又說起話來，道：「啊，可正不是嗎？我們有時還跟了他的音樂跳舞，做體操呢。我自己喜歡一個銅鼓，正想及早把它學會。」</p>
<p>「我最愛的是提琴；我也能彈一個的，」乃德道，他在這有趣的題目上，不禁說起知心話來了。</p>
<p>「你能夠嗎？」韜摩問時，並以充滿了興趣的圓睜的眼從他水杯的邊上望着他。「裴先生有一個舊提琴，他會讓你玩的，假如你要的話。」</p>
<p>「你問我能嗎？啊，那是我最喜歡沒有的了。你瞧，我常常和父親，以及另外一個人，一路玩提琴跑碼頭，直到他死了為止。」</p>
<p>「這不有趣的嗎？」韜摩驚服之餘，不禁喊道。</p>
<p>「不，這是可怕的；冬天那麼冷，夏天那麼熱。我有時倦了；他們有時發了惱，我吃的東西也不夠」乃德說到這裹，停下來將薑汁餅咬了一大塊，彷彿要使他確實相信苦命的年頭兒是已過去了的；然後他更以惋惜的神氣說道，「可是我確也愛我的提琴，不見了它，也覺得不自在。那個人——倪古老——等我父親死後便把它取了去，並且也不再要我，說我是有病的。」</p>
<p>「假如你彈得好，他們會要你加入音樂隊。看我說在這裹。」</p>
<p>「你們這裹有音樂隊嗎？」於是乃德的眼睛亮了起來。</p>
<p>「我想是有的；一隊活潑歡喜的音樂隊，一起都是男孩子；他們有時舉辦個演奏會和這一類的東西。你祗須明天晚上看好了。」</p>
<p>說了這一番歡欣鼓舞的話後，韜摩又復去享用他的晚餐，乃德卻漸漸深入於非非的遐想，雖然食物滿前，也似無心去嘗味了。</p>

<p>— 漁</p>
<p>透過針孔所見的世界，也許眞有這樣現象：視泰山如丘垤、須彌爲芥子、客觀的世界，事實决不是這樣小；然而人的世界，可决不是怎樣大。在人爲的世界中，你所能覺察存在的世界，只有針孔般的大小。因此你所能曉得的：米幾個錢一升，柴幾個錢一斤，布幾個錢一尺，什麼地方有油水可撈，什麽地方有女人可嫖，不及　個標準，則你是一個傻子，超乎這標準，則你是一個叛道者。一個傻子，最多不過爲開玩笑的資料而已，一個叛道者，「古已有之」的辦法是「繩之以法」，法里賽人的釘死耶穌，頗具這樣的意味。傻子而供開玩笑的資料，叛道者而供維持法律尊嚴，寥寥幾個傻子，寥寥幾個叛道者，行古老的辦法，送上十字架，或「屏之遠方」，則一個社會的完整，自無問題。不過人之不齊。各如其面，就是你用斯巴達人殺戮嬰孩的辦法，强制使之齊，但人力總有時而窮的。傻子滔滔皆是也，叛道者亦頗不少。這就難了。在他方面，卽是你自己認爲合格了，然而早有些歐洲的優生學者們，據說根據生物學的立塲，拿出他們學者的權威，很不客氣地斷定有色人種是不良的種族。這種學說，無論正確與否，可是我們的稗販學者，自命爲權威的××家學的人們，頗拾外人的唾餘，說我們的種族這樣，種族那樣，這樣一來，我們不是都變爲傻子，就是白人文化的危害者，到了追時候，問題頗有些嚴重了。</p>
<p>自然說這種語的少數白人，自別有目的，這種說敎信不信可由我們了。信仰他而　甘列於低等的，那當別論，不信他而想爭一日之長的，自必把這種汚蔑的言論，一脚踢開去。可是有一先决條件，那就是在這種族將遭空前大危難的時候，我們的眼光也應該離開那針孔，我們的觀察的世界，應該不是米幾個錢一升，柴幾個錢一斤，布幾個錢一尺，什麼地方　油水撈，什麽地方有可嫖。個人的生存是有限的，種族的縣延是無窮的，問題就在爲個人的目前享樂呢？爲社團無限的縣延。走前者的路，那末什麽都不必認，走後者的路，就得以獅子博牛的力量，與外來的勢力鬭，與天然的災害鬭。　在就在這過程中。所以目前的時期，正如狄更斯在他二城故開頭所說的一樣：「是最好的時期，也是最患的時期；……　光明的季節，也是黑晴的季節；是希望之春，也是失望之冬，我們有一切在我們的面前，我們沒有一件東西在我們面前，我們都直接走向天堂，我們都却直接走向別的方向……」這幾句話，可以說明了這時代的一切。然而我們可正不必失望，也不必畏懼。社會的變遷，正是社會的演進的歷程。HG威爾斯在他的「人類的工作財富與幸福」（TheWorkWealthandHappinessofMankind）一書中的序言說「…—我們一切人到現在才開始了解我們是生活在我們時代任何體制的兌變中，在一個混亂中，一個新的就將成長。一切種類的力量都在目前進行着解體的工作，但同時郤在建設一稈較大的奇怪的機構的新氣象，使我們在那裏面適應生活。」推陳山新，這是一個必然的歷程。而作爲社會原動力的人們，唯一的任務，就在放大了目光，發揮人的力量，集結起來盡　人的任呀！</p>

<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>梅蘭芳博士說是載了榮譽歸來了。</p>
<p>在囂然衆口中有這樣幾種說法：甲說中國戲劇在歐洲那麼受歡迎，那一定中國舊戲還有很光明的前途：乙說梅博士從歐洲歸來，他將採取歐洲戲曲之所長，補中國舊戲之所短，產生一種中戲爲體西戲爲用式的新戲曲；丙說歐洲人心目中的梅博士，等於歐洲人心目中的非洲野人，只是一種好奇的心理，其意義並不高於朗德田的環遊世界。把梅蘭芳歐遊這回事估價太高或太低，以爲梅蘭芳的戲劇將使歐洲戲曲界起大變化固　妄語，卽說梅博士走馬看花忽忽走了一趟，會使中國舊戲曲有什麽大變化，也是期望過多：自然說梅博士這樣走了一趟，全沒有意義，也是半缸醋的說法，我們不能首肯的。</p>
<p>藝術的形式，常是花樣翻新：從極舊的形式中，加一番改造，便成爲簇新的樣式。彷彿旗袍一樣，穿在糜登女郎身上，並不覺得不調和。世界藝術之流，東西互相灌漑，從來分割不開，譬如觀世音菩薩，她包含有希臘的神話成分，又參加印度人的色彩，到了中國，再把她塗飾起來；誰也不能說屬於某時某地的產物。西洋戲曲中，承受希伯來埃及人的藝術形式極多，中國戲曲中，吸收了西域，印度的藝術形式，俄國介於歐亞兩大陸之間，很早就滲注了東方的色彩：由於梅蘭芳的表演，使他們更注意一點中國戲曲的形式，本無不可能之理。另一方面，梅蘭芳看了許多西洋的戲曲形式，他用來改變一點中國戲曲的形式，也事實上所應有。但這都是逐步改良，戲曲界並不因此激起大波浪，中國舊戲曲並不因此有光明的前途。</p>
<p>我所要問梅博士的：戲曲的內容，屬於意識部分的，梅博士究竟有沒有什麽變動？就戲言戲，麒麟童所演的九更天，的確能够感動觀衆；廣吿上時常看見「九更天代滾釘板」字樣。但那是提倡封建哲學的劇本，固然還有地主看佃戶輪月當値的事實，奴婢制度還是到處存在着，我們决不承認「代滾釘板」有「人」的意義。又如百壽圖那本吉祥戲，明明該寫軍閥專橫，沒落時代皇帝的悲痛，偏演作公主尊嚴不可侵犯，由皇帝作調人，然後夫婦和好如初，其歪曲事實，早失去了時代的意義。中國舊戲的沒落，並不是形式的沒落，乃是內容的沒落。舊戲以擁護農村宗法社會的道德爲牠的唯一使命，農村宗法社會旣已完全崩潰，生在那土地上的花卉，自然都萎敗下來了。梅博士對於社會現實的看法，若沒有澈底的改變，不把戲曲的內容完全改變過，無論那一種改良方式都是徒然的。</p>
<p>我對於梅博士並沒有過大的期望，只期望他自己不要辜負了這一回的遊俄。</p>

<p>檳榔嶼，半年不見的　帝我我去關仔　　海濱。　那是黑夜，燈塔閃掃着　片日光在海上。檳榔嶼　峽的海潮，奏着低沈而　謐的音調　微風輕輕地在所坐的背椅上吹拂，遠處馬來半島的海岸閃射着微弱的燈光。世界是一片的黑暗，檳榔嶼住民區的市聲是異常低沈，海用着催眠的樂曲，輕輕地吻着海岸。天上閃着星星，美麗的海面隊播出背後音樂亭的音傳所樂奏出來的樂調。一種天籟與人籟的交流，融和成一片和諧的韻律。柔和的空氣，抑揚的樂聲，溫婉的海潮和燈塔發出來的明亮的燈光，匯合成關仔崅的海濱之美如果說新加坡的海是雄偉與壯烈的，那麽關仔崅薄薄的片海却是秀婉而柔和的。新加坡的海潮鼓起了人的雄心和熱血，檳榔嶼的海水却敎人沈入藝術的沈深的境界。新加坡的明亮的海面使人展開幽深的幻想之翼，檳榔嶼的秀麗的海面却敎人張開美術家之眼，如果說新加坡的海是可愛的，那麽檳榔嶼的也未曾不令人眷戀的了。</p>
<p>隔天也曾去呌做Fun的海濱。那完全是鄉村的樸素的海景。海的前面躺着廣大的沙灘，下午的陽光把細沙映成金色。岸上是枕着大片的碧綠，海水中浮起零落的人影。遠處悠遠地偶然傳來了微小的市聲，飛禽的鳴呌響澈得可被聽見，海上偶或浮起了一片帆影，一堆淡薄的白雲會在天空上浮移。這里的空氣是沈寂得像在晚中，海平靜地　臥，宛　像酣夢不醒。</p>

<p>— 柴大珂</p>
<p>孩子六歲了，一天一天長大起來，很活潑；也會淘氣，和旁的孩子，一般要吃愛玩，吃飽了不够，趕着媽媽要，成大的玩着，也不知道疲倦，玩得起勁，連飯都忘記吃。媽螞的喚聲提醒了他，才走上飯桌，沒精打彩地。高興着笑，氣惱了哭，也和旁的孩子一樣，他不知道怨哀，有的，他只是看了隔壁的哥哥弟弟姊姊妹妹儘多着，自己却沒有，便發生了羨慕的心。但是他到底沒有，所以他又氣又恨，恨得厲害時，便借哭出氣，據他媽媽吿訴他說：「人家的哥哥弟弟姊姊妹妹，不能奪了過來，算是寶寶的；這和寶寶的皮球木槍刺刀是寶寶的，不能給人家搶去算是人家的一樣。寶實是媽媽生的：是媽媽的，所以媽媽才愛！」孩子並不知道哥哥弟弟姊姊妹妹是怎麼會事，他只知道只有個媽媽是屬於他的；他是媽媽的，可是他覺得隔壁的哥哥弟弟姊姊妹妹很可愛；和他很合得來，他便愛和他們玩。當然啦！他們是也很愛這可當的孩子，孩子所怕着不敢接近的，只是隔壁孩子的母親。</p>
<p>「呌化子……小癟三……」隔壁孩子的母親，常常這樣地叱駡着孩子。「呌化子是多麽可厭的東西。」孩子在想：「不是那種髒的枯瘦的一個麽？」</p>
<p>「我有了一個哥哥或是妹妹便好了！」　在他感覺種寂時，總是唯一的希望着，如果希望是實現了，誰說？這孩子不是辛福的個？但他永久沈浸在這怨哀之中，他只有和隔壁底哥哥姊姊……玩時，才把這怨哀暫時忘掉，可是在他獨自個在想些什麽時，這怨哀立時走進他的小小的胸窩。</p>
<p>「隔壁的哥哥姊姊……是成天在一塊兒，假使寶寶有了一個哥哥或姊姊妹妹時，也可以成天到晚，在一個屋子裏玩；一隻棹子上吃飯：一張床上睡覺了！」當他母親上街買東西時，他個人真孤獨得可憐！他是需要個或二個的哥哥姊姊弟弟妹妹啊！」孩子有些懷疑，問他媽說：「隔壁的孩子，旣然不是寶寶的哥哥姊姊弟弟妹妹，爲什麽寶寶呌喚他們哥哥姊姊弟弟妹妹？」雖則孩子覺到隔壁的孩子，是待他很好；而同時他們正互相親暱地呌着。</p>
<p>「呌呌也罷了，不過他們究兌不是寶寶的哥哥姊姊弟弟妹妹！寶寶的哥哥……是……？」他媽是這樣流着淚回答，孩子很奇怪！他一提起要一個哥哥或姊姊時，他母親總是哽咽得說不出話來！孩子是覺得母親的飲泣是可愛的，能够同情他沒有一個哥哥或姊姊！不像隔壁孩子們的母親，動不動就打人駡人！把他唯一的游戲伴侶拆散。</p>
<p>孩子很不喜歡看時常沈鬰着的媽媽的臉，也從不常吒到媽媽嘻嘻哈哈的笑聲，他快活着；媽媽並不一定是快活，只有他淘氣了；母親却會裝着鬼臉笑臉，逗引孩子笑，孩子識字讀書時；母親也是笑着的孩子領會到，只有識字讀書是能逗引出他媽媽的笑臉，因爲，媽媽的笑險，是孩子所喜歡看的。</p>
<p>隔壁的孩子穿的是花的紅的；帽子上嵌着閃閃發光的玻璃塊，很好看，孩子也愛，只恨自已穿的，總是那麽白的袴；黑的帽；藍的短衫那麽淡淡的顏色。可不是麽！那天孩子吵着要紅的襖，媽媽同孩子在街上剪了一件紅老布的短襖。</p>
<p>「隔壁的哥哥弟弟…來槍寶寶的紅布襖了！媽媽！我司不給他們呢！」當夜他便這樣狂呌着在夢裏警醒過來，因爲，這件紅的布襖，是他唯一的心愛物。隔壁的孩子們的爸爸，隔了好久總得回家幾次，而且總得帶些玩的吃的歸來，使孩子們歡喜，那不是一個高大的身材，和對過人家的包車夫一般麽！」孩子是這樣地紀憶着，但孩子的爸爸的影子都不曾回來，孩子是始終沒有看見一個身材高大的男子　他理想中的爸爸，據母親說：「爸爸是在很遠的地方賺錢。」孩子想：爸爸非但不愛他；而且他也不愛媽媽，否則，爲什麽不回來看看媽媽！因爲他看見他媽說起了爸爸就弔淚。</p>
<p>孩子想：「爸爸眞是一個可怕的動物，隔壁的孩子們，不是常常給他爸爸打得高聲的狂喊嗎！他們屁股不是靑一塊紫一塊嗎！」</p>
<p>「爸爸一定是可怕的人物！」隔壁孩子們的爸，是在賺錢；孩子的爸爸，也在賺錢；賺錢是一般的；那麼兇惡也是一般了。他堅决的肯定了，爸爸是這樣的一個動物想起了爸爸便使他怕，他極力　把腦中的幻想推出來，可是，越想越怕，夜裏便發魘，夢見一個陌生的兇惡的男子，重重的打他。幸運得很，爸爸是始終不歸來，這才使他安心了一半。</p>
<p>孩子也連想到媽媽說起爸爸便要哭，一定因爲爸爸是打了媽媽，這樣，孩子便很堅决地把望他爸爸永久不回來，但是同時他更需要有個像媽媽一般可愛的哥哥……。</p>

<p>我們走過蔭道，進入林子，已經快到通上跳舞屋去那條小路了，此時我們從另一邊林木看過去，看見好多人圍聚在海灘上面。他們靠近水面站着，似乎忙着把一件看不淸楚的東西安放在地下。正在這個時候，有一個穿捕魚衣服的人走上山來。「底下有甚麼事情！」我順便問一句。</p>
<p>「不是好事情，先生！」他回答，「一個年輕姑娘落水死了。」</p>
<p>「娜麗啊！」我喊，不知不覺把弗里茨底手抓着。</p>
<p>他嚇得喊了一聲。『你說甚麽！』他說，來遮掩他的感情。</p>
<p>同時我們就互相密契地穿過林木走下海濱去。我在路上聽見底下衆人紛紛談論此事。『她有甚麼事情過不去呢？』一個組南聲音說。『這大概是一位高貴小姐，你看她是穿得齊齊整整跳下水去的。』後又沒有聲音了，祇是波浪在淸晨空氣裏頭滾動的聲音。</p>
<p>當我們從樹林走出來時候，整個海灣散佈滿了太陽光輝，我幾乎被牠照得暈眩了。她也在這陽光照耀之下躺着。我們一走近來，那些捕魚人便向旁邊讓開；我們淸淸楚楚看見她。沒受一點障礙。果然是她？再沒有一點疑惑了！蒼白的面孔擱在沙灘上；一雙跳舞的小脚現在不動地從衣服底下露了出來；水淋淋的一頭黑髮掛滿了海藻和貝殼。白玫瑰已經不在了，也許是落到海底去了。</p>

<p>— 行安</p>
<p>我們還記得，兩年前淮安親安小學，曾有七位小學生，自動組織了一個旅行團，到上海來旅行過。他們組織這個旅行團，目的在體騐實際的社會生活，打破大人不信任小孩子的觀念。他們出來旅行，並沒有大人領導，凡一切起居飲食，都由自己管理。他們一到上海，立刻就活動起來，交際啦，參觀啦，演講啦，儼然同大人的旅行團一樣，什麼都應討得有條有理。當時頗引起社會上一般人的注目。</p>
<p>事隔兩年，現在可注意的消息又傳來了。新安小學這一次的雄心更大，他們的旅行，路程是遠得多了，是一個十省的旅行。這次旅行團的團員，共十餘人。最長的十九歲，最幼的十二歲。時間暫定爲三個月。旅行目的地，爲魯冀察綏陝豫皖鄂湘等十省。一切的費用，全恃他們幾個小學生，沿途賣書演講的收入來維持。必要時將放映電影及唱留聲機，作種種的宣傳。聞現在各事已籌備就緒，約於下月初，便可開始出發。這眞是一件驚人的壯舉。</p>
<p>本來，學校生活是不能完全離開社會生活的。社會卽學校，一個學生於受學校敎育之外，還須不時親自到社會體騐各種的實際生活，以備他日出學校加入社會去活動。但我國敎育，社會自社會。學校與社會，隔離得太遠，幾如風馬牛之不相關。這點是應該改良的。新安小學之兩次組織旅行團，使學生有實地體騐社會生活的機會，這意義是很重大的。</p>
<p>然小學生舉行長途旅行，用意雖善，但這行爲未免太冒險。十省的旅行，大人也有些不敢嘗試，小孩子更是一件困難的事。况我國各省，交通不便，地方不靜，途次的阻碍甚多。非有充分的指導與安全的辦法，實不能使人放心。這一點學校當局應加以考慮。</p>
<p>最後，我們希望這一次新安小學生的十省旅行，能獲得最大的成功，在這兒童年留下一個光榮的紀錄。</p>
<h3 id="c181">翠亨鄉 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— 艾荼</p>
<p>翠亨鄉——孫中山先生底家鄕，一個多麽令人迷戀的名字呀！那兒蘊藏着偉大底氣息，有着精美的風味。我帶着懷慕的心情，從老遠的都市跑到那兒去了。</p>
<p>離開了繁盛的石岐，在碼頭上的汽車站搭了岐關公司的長途汽車，買了到翠亨鄕的票子，就讓汽車像瘋狂了似的在平坦的公路上駛向南下。那時，從窗子眺望出去儘是一片一片的平野與廣大的田塲，一座一座的村莊矗立在平野或山崗的邊兒上。疏疏的綠林好像幽怨似的給南方的海風飄出來的颼颼的聲息，歡息似的——這時，我的眼睛雖是望着郊野的風景是那麽迅速地掠過去，但是腦袋里却憧憬着翠亨鄕那兒所有的偉大的史蹟，憧憬着那許多小孩子們總是歡迎地在那兒嘻笑……一切的都把我佔有了。</p>
<p>在途中，車廂飛也似的駛着，穿過高山和華麗的新舊混合的村子，那兒耳以看到許多詩意的畫圖，有時在滾着潺潺的水聲的小溪邊，可以看到一些天眞活潑的姑娘們提着籃子到溪邊的石塊上滌洗衣裳。那完全沒有悲哀的笑臉上，透出了一股一股迷人底氣息，那無邪而可愛的眼珠子，閃呀閃的在瞪着從他們的身邊駛了過去的汽車，有時她們那嬝娜的，忸怩的身子，愉快地跳着，送出來有趣的笑聲。這一些眞給長慣在都市的人們感到生活在鄉村是非常幸福的。還有，她們戴着和別地方不同的風格底大帽子，這帽子在別個鄕村里只有男人才戴的。高尖的而闊闊的竹帽，有時還弄一點花樣的，歪歪兒的，那麽康健的委態跟大都巿的女兒們的嬌柔造作，而失去了天眞的姿態絕對兩樣的。</p>
<p>汽車的迅速度大約行了兩點鐘，便到了翠亨鄕，我落了車廂，在一個亭子里休息着，吸着山海間吹來的風。那時，眼睛的視綫落在叢林下面的小村子，那兒便是翠亭鄕——一個不怎麽大的村子吧，后山上長着廣闊的而是葱茂的綠林，從林梢透出來的哨聲是那麽起勁的，颼颼地。村子的式樣跟別個村子不兩樣，十八世紀底式樣吧，但並不殘頹，而且很穩健的，在村的左邊靠着空地的兩間比較高一點的屋子，那便是總理的家，據說他幼年時是望族，不錯，這史蹟還很明顯的遺留在我們的眼前呢。所以，他們的家總比別家爲美麗精緻了一點兒的。</p>
<p>翠亨鄉的前面是一片廣闊的田野，在總理童年的時候一定是在這兒玩慣了的。從村子對過不遠，便有一條很淸幽的小溪，溪岸上長生着不怎麼大的綠樹，很可以駕着小舟在水面游蕩，這兒，就是總理少年時代把社神的牌子拋在水里的地方。溪水縈迥地，遠遠的，令人感到淸靜的鄉村里的美麗來，就是在夏天，這兒也不失爲一個可以作爲避暑的地方吧。</p>
<p>翠亨鄉的旁邊，便是「中山先生紀念學校」的新學舍，高高地，紅磚綠瓦，新世紀的西洋風味。當我到那兒去的時候，還有幾位敎師很高興的帶着我麥觀各個地方，我也覺得他們敎學的成績不會壤。所以，我的心更愉快了。</p>
<p>在村子里的時候，那天眞而活潑的小孩子們跟着我們笑問時，全不像陌生的朋友似的親近地帶着我到許多山林河岸的地方去流浪，他們還嘻笑的講着總理童年時代的有趣的故事，什麽地方是總理最愛的地方，這時，我全然是一個不知悲哀的小孩子一樣哈哈跟着跳和笑起來了。——那些可愛的小孩子們是有着別個地方不同的風度呵！</p>
<p>到了下午，太陽將落在林子後的時候，我才離開了可愛的翠亨鄉，又跨上了汽車，怱怱地向着南方去了。</p>
<h3 id="c182">夏天的傍晚 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— 華之</p>
<p>夏天的傍晚，要算最舒適的時候了。一整天像烤鴨一樣悶在寫字間里，那些數字和文件什麽之類幾乎把頭腦都弄昏了。卽使風扇一刻也沒有停過地在頭頂上打旋，但是一點都感不到風的涼快，彷彿是一股暖流要把自己捲去似的：况且兩邊太陽穴里被什麽抽搐着，心中就是一陣惡心，來不及想嚼一點八封丹。這樣，要整整八點鐘，一如一個失了自由的囚犯，不由自己作一點主。雖然在飯後的兩小時中，可以躺到沙發里偸一點兒懶，但是背上的汗漬總是滑膩膩地不大舒服。自然，每個人所希望的，就是傍晚的時侯了。</p>
<p>譬如說罷：當你像一個逃犯似的回到家里，一件不勝逼切之至的工作當然是洗澡，於是你一下子—彷彿一個快手魔術家，把衣服都剝了乾凈，跳到浴缸里去。浴缸里是放着合度的祖水，把自家疲勞的身體浸着浸着，或許你忘了外面已是萬家燈火的時候。你享受着這種</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>說不出來的舒服，像做夢般地，直到家里人喚你用晚膳，才覺得時間是過得太快了。</p>
<p>那末，擦乾了全身，精神已經完全恢復了，披上薄質的衣衫到天井里用晚膳。家人一定爲你特備了你所喜歡的菜餚，如果你已結了婚，更有一個剛會蹦蹦跳跳的孩子，所謂家庭的樂趣，無過於此了。</p>
<p>這時候，新芽一樣的月亟在天的東角，地面上的暑氣亦已散盡，你們可以敞開了大門，讓凉快的晚風在你們的飯桌四週吹過。快樂地用過了晚膳，就把飯桌子搬開，一仰身大家躺到藤椅里，而且一定有凉茶預備你飯後解渴，或者還有半個餘下來的西瓜。而你的孩子呢？他是不允許你安安靜靜地躺着的，但是這時侯你精神非常舒暢，你很高興講故事給他聽，那些牛大哥，貓妹妹你祇要隨意編扯，孩子却已聽得很樂意了。假使你境遇好一點，你能够租着一個較大的院子，當然你是很喜歡種一點花木的：那些攀着高牆的是牽牛花，那是種最容易長大的花。沿着牆脚隨便播一點子，用幾條草繩附着高牆，牠是很快地生滿了全牆的花。夏天能多見花木，是最賞心悅目的。你從辦公室歸來的時候，也可以到院子中去走走，看着牠們被一天的驕陽曬着，變成一個憔悴的女人樣子，心中能很有些捨不得的。但是等到月亮上升，牠們和你的精神一樣都恢復了舊觀：低垂的已昻起了頭，萎縮的也放足了花朶。雖然都是些沒有香味的花草，在晚風中却自有一股淸香之感。沿院子四周，鳳仙和雞冠也是少不了，紅的花，綠的葉；如果能種幾缸荷花，那是更好了，在一根根挺直的幹上開着白的花朶，而牠的香味眞是沁人心肺。在這種情景下，卽是有許多緊要的工作等着你去做，你是冉也捨不得離開了。抽着烟捲，微微盍上眼，剛纔辦公室中所受來的悶氣，現在早已無影無蹤地消散了。你的孩子聽飽了故事之後，他是偎到母親的懷中去了，或許沒有幾分鐘的時候，已經微微地打着呼聲，睡熟了。因爲是飯後，你妻子是不讓他睡的，於是喚他，喊他，聽爹爹講故事，或是吃西瓜，用種種方法要他醒來，但是小孩子是世界上最自由的人，他要睡就沒有辦法使他醒。那末抱到臥室里去，不過在你妻子一個來回中，你自己也會不由自主地睡去的。喚醒你來的時候，你一定忍不住笑了，才脚步蹣跚地進屋，一個可愛底夏天的傍晚就這樣悄悄地過去了。</p>

<p>— 達</p>
<p>太陽枕在遠遠的西邊的黛碧的山尖兒上，像一隻燒紅的大銅鑼，沒勁兒有氣沒力地往山背後裏鑽。驀地裏，西邊的天際燒遍了大半個天兒血紅的彩雲，一朶朶靉靉鱗鱗的蠻美麗的。</p>
<p>陣陣的烏鴉，彷彿一隊解散了的士兵，毫無紀律的，從河的這邊飛投到對岸的叢林裏去，咿咿呀呀的，一面飛，一面拚命地吹着嘴，雜哄哄地吵得够使人討厭！然而，牠彷彿負了另外的一種使命，—喚醒了另一羣可憐的人兒。</p>
<p>「瑞香，起來吧，辰光兒已是不早了。……趕快起來裝扮，你看，——太陽兒已沉到山背後巴兒去了」。一個肥胖胖的，約莫四十年紀，穿着香雲綢短衫袴的老媽子似的婆娘在後梢頭彎着腰拖着地板，很小心地楷凈着花瓶，茶杯。她抬起頭來看看天，高聲地喊着。同時，她好像累極似的喘着氣，噓噓的像一頭田間勞動着的老牛，嘟　噥噥自語着：「眞是一年不如一年，想不到這老媽子做的事情，現在也自家兒擔當起來了」！</p>
<p>瑞香從睡夢中醒過來，伸一回嬾腰，定定神，然後推開了靠左邊的船舷的小窗，探出半個瓜子兒腦袋兒來瞧望着：天是澄淸的，浮盪着輕飄飄的流雲：水像遠山般的靑碧，泛着灧灧漣漣的細波。她心窩底裏想，「這麽好的天氣，又剛巧碰着十五夜，月姊兒正長滿了圓胖胖的臉龐，怪嬌騷的。當此良辰美景，看來今夜的生意，一定準穩撈得他娘的幾十隻光袁頭。……」想，心花兒開放了，笑着，抿一會嘴，媚個貓騷兒眼，迅速地走到梳妝檯前，對若鏡子，整理着叢草似的蓬鬆的頭髮。</p>
<p>夜息漸漸地沉下去，黃昏的黯淡的影子，彷彿一團埋伏的兵似的，從遇這過緩地爬出來，遠遠的黛碧的晚山，給吞唾去了。這時候，瑞香把右手撑在腮準兒上，坐在花艇的前頭，模樣兒瞧起來多嬌俏！臉擦那　天上的彩雲，兩道眉兒像兩條彎曲的黑綫。她穿着一件軟薄的綢旗袍，胸膛蠻豐滿的，兩隻新墳似的奶子尖兒，硬挺挺的突出來，彷彿要刺破這軟薄的綢衣。她瞥見岸上過往的遊人，就投送上一個不很自然的邪婢淫蕩的媚笑，騷狐精似的，想挑逗遊人的情竇。可是，她儘管使盡所有的本事丟送着邪婢淫蕩的媚笑，但始終却沒有一個人肯輕易地走上花艇來。</p>
<p>月亮慢慢的從對岸的林梢裏昇浮起來，滿圓的像一只白玉盤，皎皎潔潔的，頓時江心就蕩漾着一條蜿蜓如練而又無窮盡的銀蛇了。雖則是六月的大毒熱天，可是，這裏却是夜凉勝地，蒲葵扇是用不着的，凉風習習陣陣的吠拂着，夾帶來對岸的龍眼花的芬郁的氣息，這氣息嘗陶醉過瑞香的心，使她感到生活的可貴和快樂。然而，現在，龍眼花的氣息還是這樣的芬芳農郁，但她的心境已不像三年前的心境了。她開始地感到失望和困倦，腦袋沉沉地低垂，很威動很傷心地沉入三年前的夢裏。花艇上的姑娘，渡過着歌酒的生活，可是，那時的生活的豪華，生意的熱鬧，聲譽的顯紅，誰能料到三年後的今日，她的門庭會這麼的寥落呢？要說她已是老了，惹不起人們的注意，這話的理由，在瑞香是萬不敢相信的，她時時對着鏡子裏端詳，一切都和三年前不會兩樣，皮肉兒依然。肥嫩豐澤。到底生意的淸淡是爲着什麼原因呢？要說是爲了徵收花捐，歌捐，筵席捐……而使一般逛艇子的人們歛跡，沒有興緻兒，這不是充分的理由哩！然而，生意的淸淡已是事實，但究竟是爲了什麽，在瑞香的心窩裏，却是一個無可解答的謎兒。</p>
<p>夜色的深沉了，月亮皎俏地掛在中天，岸上的遊人已寥落落了，瑞香懷着一夥失望的心，靜悄悄地鑽進花艇裏去了。</p>
<h3 id="c184">綁（上） <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— 林豪</p>
<p>田野在暮色蒼茫中呈現出一片金黃色的光彩，那是打牛腰嶺的西邊射下來的殘陽底餘輝。晚風微微地帶來了仲夏的暖意，和細粒的飛塵。從沙蘭到這兒，坐了一整天的騾車，自家兒的臀部給石卵子的小徑震得有些酸痛；更發現那條可憐的驟兒的掙扎，它的蹄像擊着幾千萬斤的鋼鐵一樣，大鼻子裏哼出那麽急促的呼吸；於是我向正在鞭着它的騾夫說：『喂，朋友，橫豎天色也不早啦！趕路也就來不及，不如找個旅店住宿一夜吧？你瞧：騾兒也累够啦！』</p>
<p>『是，咱也是那麽想，不過，咱再來趕一陣吧，祇要把騾車趕進柳營寨，那兒便有旅店了。』那個麻臉的騾夫揚着鞭，嘴角下露出一絲冲淡的笑容。</p>
<p>趕進柳營寨已是萬家燈火了。我們在一家較大的旅店躭住下來。店主是那麽一位慈祥的老人，雖然年望已是很高，可是，一種康健和精神，是値得人們欽佩的；尤其那種爽快的談鋒，絲毫沒有時下的市儈的拘泥。</p>
<p>深夜。把窗門推開了，恰是這旅店天井，窗前種着一株低低的小樹，向樹枝的空隙間遼望着黑暗的太空，描出了一個渾圓的月，和一霎霎的簾星；靜悄悄地聽不到一些兒的聲息，偶然嘷嗥地聽到一二聲狗子的吠叫，和着夜鴟的低吟，心扉裏，升起了一陣孤獨者的愁思：靜穆，哀怨！</p>
<p>突然，遠遠地『砰砰碎』一連串的響聲，將我從孤獨的靜穆中驚醒過來，我凝視着遙遠的伏在黑色的氛圍裏的山嶺一響聲聲處—渾身像着了魔似的顫動了一下，不自覺地　入了恐怖的境域；在我經騐過去的陳跡的時侯，我下意識地斷定着那是槍聲。</p>
<p>『起來呀，客人們，快起來哪！』當我發現老主人輕微的喊聲後，更增加了我的恐怖了，因爲這一定是我剛才自己所想的相同，而且更發覺老主人的喉音是那麽略路地帶着微顫驚慌，我慚漸地把麻木似的身子站起了，一步步踱出了房門，門外已聚了好多的客大了；大家都抱着一顆奇怪的心：『喂，你，老主人，半夜三更大驚小怪地幹什麽？』</p>

<h3 id="e1">Yellow River Upper Reaches Flood, Great Waters Pass Through Shaanxi and Flow Downstream, Tongguan and Shaanxi Water Levels and Flows Increase Sharply, Downstream Provinces Are Urgently Alerted by the Flood Control Committee <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The Situation at the Black River Estuary and Willow Camp Is Very Critical; Henan River Bureau Prepares for Rescue and the People of Kaifeng Panic</p>
<p>(Kaifeng) At 8:00 PM on the 7th, the water in Shaanxi rose to 296.53 meters, with a flow rate of 16,800 cubic meters per second. It is estimated that it will pass through Kaifeng at 12:00 AM on the 8th, which is larger than the previous flood and the flood in 1933. Huang Li, Hui Anlisen, and others, as well as Ye Songsheng of the Flood Control Office and Song Tong of the River Bureau, all went to inspect on the morning of the 8th, and rushed to transport sacks by car, with gas lamps and gasoline for night rescue. County magistrates along the river were ordered to supervise and urge the people to go to the river to assist. Kong Xiangrong decided to rush back to Kaifeng on the evening of the 8th to monitor and protect the fourth section of southern Hebei. Citizens are buying rice and noodles in preparation for any eventuality. (8th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Kaifeng) The river water is rising rapidly. At about 6:00 AM on the 8th, the River Bureau collected 10,000 sacks and iron anchors to transport there. All personnel rushed to the river. Zhang Hanying, Shi Huatang, and 500 soldiers dispatched by Liu Zhi rushed by car to prepare for rescue. Troops also transported sacks from Tiangong at each city gate to build blocking projects. Most of the wealthy are taking trains westward to Zhengzhou to take refuge, and people are panicking. (8th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Economic Committee received a telegram from the Yellow River Water Conservancy Committee on the 8th, stating that at 1:00 PM on the 7th, the water level at Tongguan was 324.48 meters, with a flow rate of 9,800 cubic meters per second. At 8:00 PM on the same day, the water level at Shaanxi was 196.54 meters, with a flow rate of 16,800 cubic meters per second. This is 1.27 meters higher than the highest water level during the breach at Dongzhuang last month, and Shaanxi is 1.71 meters higher. The flow rate at Tongguan increased by 5,600 cubic meters per second, and Shaanxi increased by 6,820 cubic meters per second. The situation is very tense, and the dikes in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan downstream should be carefully reinforced immediately. The Economic Committee has telegraphed the governments of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces, instructing the Yellow River Conservancy Bureau to be on strict guard all night, and to step up preparations for all rescue works to avoid accidents. (8th Special Telegram)</p>

Now, the state is a republic, with the people as the masters and the officials as the servants.

<p>(Tokyo) Jiji Shimpo has learned that the British government suggested to the Japanese government holding Anglo-Japanese local talks to resolve outstanding issues in East Asia. This proposal was made to Matsudaira, the Japanese ambassador to the UK, who is currently on leave in Japan. The British suggested that this meeting should be held in Tokyo in the autumn. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) An official at the British Embassy in Tokyo told a Reuters reporter today that they were unaware of any British proposal to hold Anglo-Japanese talks. They do not believe the news reported by Jiji Shimpo. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) The report carried today by the Tokyo Jiji Shinpo that the British suggested holding Anglo-Japanese talks in Tokyo this autumn to discuss Far Eastern matters has been denied by London. However, it is said that both sides may begin consultations on naval and other issues this autumn through ordinary diplomatic channels. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) The suggestion circulating in Tokyo that the UK and Japan will hold a meeting this autumn to discuss Anglo-Japanese relations worldwide, including the Far East issue, is quite welcome here. This statement cannot currently be verified. It has been heard that the Japanese ambassador to the UK, Matsudaira, returned home in July to seek a better understanding between the two countries. Public opinion believes that the import quotas imposed by British colonies could be used by the British government in negotiations to deal with Japan. An investigation shows that in the first six months of 1934, the amount of Japanese rayon fabrics imported into Sierra Leone was 255,141 yards. Imports have decreased greatly in the first six months of this year, almost to nothing. Furthermore, the complex situation in Inner and Outer Mongolia will have possible repercussions on Russo-Japanese relations. Public opinion feels that this matter will have an important relationship with the overall situation. The public also believes that Japan's national expenditures have greatly increased and that huge loans are constantly needed to balance its budget, which can restrain the activities of ambitious people. With the current coolness of Chinese sentiment towards Britain, Britain will be cautious to avoid any indication of uniting with Japan to reject China. However, Japan's position is now clearly not to be insulted, so to restore harmony, Japan's cooperation is necessary. However, assistance can be given to China in material terms. China's need for this assistance has been recognized with sympathy by the general public. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota is proceeding with concrete measures to establish a lasting and friendly relationship between China and England based on the report of Ambassador Matsudaira to the UK. However, this plan requires the active cooperation of the UK. That is, the UK, recognizing Japan's position in East Asia and realizing that Anglo-Japanese cooperation can only maintain British interests in the Far East, should actively cooperate with Japan's naval disarmament proposal to ensure the success of the agreement. If the UK hopes to establish friendly Anglo-Japanese relations, it should immediately abolish the economic alliance of boycotting Japanese goods in its own country and colonies. (Domei, 8th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Japanese sources, Foreign Minister Hirota is determined to find a way to adjust commercial relations between the UK and Japan. The British government's plan to reject trade between Japan and British colonies, such as abolishing the Indo-Japanese Commercial Treaty of 1905 and increasing import taxes on Japanese cotton fabrics in India, is almost a fatal blow to Japan. If the UK wishes to cultivate amicable relations with Japan, it should develop a generous economic policy towards Japan. This is said to be the only way to unite friendship. Furthermore, Jiji Shinpo stated that if the UK formally recognizes Japan's power in East Asia and reconsiders events between the UK and Japan, a satisfactory resolution can be reached, which will have a good influence on naval negotiations between the two countries. The newspaper also claimed that the proposal for Anglo-Japanese talks clearly prevents the failure of the London Naval Conference. The UK, after Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, has achieved rapid economic progress worldwide, which is greatly alarmed. It deeply feels that to maintain peace in East Asia, Japan's cooperation cannot be ignored. Therefore, before Ambassador O'Neill left London to return home, he discussed with him the suggestion that he convey to Foreign Minister Hirota a sincere discussion between the UK and Japan on commercial matters and issues related to China. The Foreign Minister now intends to accept it. Japan hopes that the British ambassador to China and Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, the economic advisor to the British government, can represent the UK at the meeting. The newspaper concluded by saying that Sir Miles Lampson, the British Ambassador to China, has tentatively agreed to the request to attend. (Reuters, 8th)</p>

<p>(London) Today, all newspapers reported that Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, the government's chief economic advisor, will be going to China. They all consider this the most important step taken by Britain in the Far East in many years and can be seen as the beginning of a new constructive policy by Britain in China.

He does not see reporters but speaks with those familiar with the Far East situation. He never expresses his own opinions because he has no preconceptions and will only be able to express them after arriving in China in person.

<p>(Washington) The Navy Department today opened bids for private shipyards to build one light cruiser, one aircraft carrier, eight destroyers, and three submarines. It is reported that bids will also be opened soon for eleven warships to be built in government shipyards. After this project is completed, the US Navy's aircraft carriers and cruisers will have reached the treaty limit. Destroyers and submarines will still be 54 short. A spokesman for the Navy Department reiterated today that the Navy Department has decided to replenish and replace warships that are too old. Therefore, by the end of 1936, seven battleships will be built. However, construction may be temporarily suspended until Japan's intentions are determined. (National News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Navy Department has decided to build 24 new battleships, of which 13 will be opened for bidding tomorrow morning by private manufacturers, and the remaining 11 will be built in state-owned shipyards. Their total tonnage is 63,000 tons. According to the new ships that the United States has planned to build in order to reach the treaty limit, 62 ships have been started, totaling 220,500 tons. Added to the existing 710,055 tons of warships within the age limit and the tonnage of the new ships to be built this time, the total is 1,000,555 tons. According to the latest news, the total tonnage of the British Navy as of this year is 1,121,393 tons. Therefore, the difference between the US and British navies is only 121,000 tons, meaning that the United States is only less than Britain by this much. Two years ago, the total tonnage of the US Navy (including new ships) was 239,800 tons less than that of Britain, and the number of ships was 102 less than that of Britain. Now, there are only 52 ships less, all of which are destroyers and submarines, including 26 destroyers and 18 submarines. After these numbers are replenished, the navies of the UK and the US will be completely equal. The 12 ships that the Navy Department has now decided to bid for construction are: (1) one 25,000-ton aircraft carrier to replace the current Langley carrier, which is only used for testing; (2) three 1,800-ton destroyers; (3) five 1,500-ton destroyers; (4) five 1,330-ton submarines.

<p>(Nanjing) Kimura, the Japanese Consul General in Manila, recently reported to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the relationship between Japan and the Philippines. The report stated that the US-Philippine Trade Association had published the situation of cotton cloth trade between Japan and the United States in the Philippines, intending to raise tariffs on Japanese goods and promote a boycott movement. According to the report, the Philippine Department of Agriculture and Commerce announced that the amount of Japanese cotton cloth imported into the Philippines in 1934 was 56,356,982 square meters, while American cotton cloth was only 43,410,603 square meters. Compared to the situation in 1933, Japan's advantage has greatly increased. Therefore, Japan has now taken the position of the United States as the largest cotton cloth exporter to the Philippines. Therefore, to protect the essence of Philippine industry and establish the principle of reciprocity in US-Philippine trade, it is currently an urgent issue to take measures to protect American goods.

<p>(Washington) The political trend in the United States shifts with the hearts of the people in Maine. Therefore, to know the evolution of the political situation in the United States today, one can consult Maine. In the special congressional election held in Rhode Island yesterday, Republican candidate Risk, with the slogan of defeating Roosevelt, received 41,237 votes, while Democratic candidate Pullins, representing the New Deal movement, was defeated with 30,142 votes. Although President Roosevelt did not say a word about this phenomenon, it has left proponents of the New Deal stunned and at a loss. At the same time, the Republican Party is deeply convinced that it will be able to defeat Roosevelt in the 1936 presidential election, said House Minority Leader Snell. This is the starting point for the demise of the New Deal. To cover up the matter, the Democratic Party comforted itself by claiming that Rhode Island was originally a Republican stronghold, and this victory was merely a manifestation of the district returning to normalcy, which is not surprising.

<h3 id="e34">Fundraising for Disaster Relief <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Disaster relief is like fighting a fire, referring to its urgency, while handling disaster relief lacks good plans, referring to its difficulty. I once saw the great Yangtze River flood in the 20th year of the Republic of China, with disaster victims covering the river downstream. The ladies and gentlemen of Shanghai took out their money, providing food and clothing. Many contributed enthusiastically without waiting for appeals. The spirit of compassion, empathy, and righteous action can be described as great. As a result, the disaster victims lingered and did not want to leave. It was difficult to send them away. Compared to the great drought disaster last year, the number of victims was no less than in the 20th year, but the public's enthusiasm for assistance was less than before. Is it that human feelings have changed so much between then and now? The reason for this is that there are years without disasters, and disaster relief is endless, weakening the power of attention, first. Helping with all one's might can be done once or twice, but not countless times. Constantly, strength is insufficient, and love cannot help, second. Rural areas are bankrupt, cities are declining, unable to take care of themselves, how can they take care of others, third. Now that the Yangtze River flood has just been reported as safe, the Yellow River flood has reappeared. The drought victims have not yet recovered, and the flood victims have followed one after another. The handling of disaster relief requires huge funds, and fundraising has no way to obtain goods. The disaster victims who are in the scorching sun and floodwaters, in the depths of water and fire, are wandering on the line of death, waiting for relief on the road to hunger. This situation is not tragic and devastating to the world.</p>
<p>It is heard that the disaster relief method has been concretely decided after six days of deliberations by the Executive Yuan. In general, the work relief part is for each affected province and city to accommodate as many disaster victims as possible in the original projects. Agricultural relief and emergency relief will be handled by the central disaster relief reserve fund of one million. An order is also issued to the provincial governments to spend two percent of the total amount of regular budget revenue each year as the disaster relief reserve fund for each province. However, even if the central government allocates huge funds, the disaster area is vast, and the number of those waiting for relief is so large that it is difficult to cover everything. Therefore, to save the disaster victims, one can only rely on the power of the public. So, how can the assistance of the public be obtained? I believe that official propaganda is essential. However, propaganda has become the end of its strength today, because everyone knows that it is propaganda for the sake of propaganda. Now, if you want to gain people's trust, you only need to focus on practical action. The so-called practical action is nothing more than giving people a common vision everywhere, not focusing on rhetoric, but being able to do it realistically and truthfully. We know that those who are in charge of disaster relief have mostly been handling disaster relief for many years and have a reputation. Or, in handling work relief, they have made remarkable achievements. However, for the sake of the disaster relief itself, for the righteousness of those who are most valuable in handling affairs, they should not be afraid to speak frankly. Because money is not wasted in vain, and real benefits are given to the people, which is the biggest principle of handling disaster relief. Making the public believe it and obtaining public support is the only condition for handling disaster relief. Both of these depend on whether the handling of affairs is appropriate or not. If those in charge of disaster relief and construction workers all have ardent emotions, pure integrity, and a spirit of hard work, then the matter will definitely be successful. On the contrary, if the evils of embezzling disaster relief, eating disaster relief, and being fat and muddled arise, and if they are shielded privately and not punished, then people's faith will be lost. Wouldn't it be difficult to follow up? We have often seen in newspapers the advertisements of various charitable organizations thanking donors. What is the content of their income and expenditure? Who has reports like credit reports? So far, there is no follow-up meeting with people in common. The donors firmly believe that the money has been donated and their hearts have been exhausted. Other things are not what they want to ask. Those who are in charge of affairs should fulfill their responsibilities and make a clear announcement. Not only should the donors know what the money they have donated is used for, but the public should also know that what they have received and spent is truly true and not false. Everyone is used for the disaster victims, so the public will naturally deepen their faith in it. If there are any actions after this, they will be happy to donate and will not be stingy. Some say that the accounts are vast and cannot be recorded. This is close to an excuse. How difficult is it to compile an accurate and concise comparison table of first-level income and expenditure? Why is it not done?</p>
<p>Fundraising should not have too many items. If there are too many, people may suspect that it is a fake name to collect money. It should not be complicated and harsh. If it is complicated and harsh, it is close to forced donations. It should not be used by people for propaganda. Once used, people may fear that it is not legitimate. The fundraising organization and personnel should be carefully selected. The audit of the donated items should be clear. Otherwise, evils will arise and the reputation will be lost. I have heard that those who specialize in charitable affairs all have religious beliefs. If they can develop a great wish to be compassionate and save people, setting an example with their own behavior, and widely persuading the world that benefiting others is benefiting oneself, it is expected that the results will be great. Unfortunately, in today's society, philanthropists still have many concerns and are unwilling to do it.</p>

(Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(London) The three-nation conference on the Italo-Abyssinian dispute will begin in Paris on August 14 or 15. The British representative is Eden, the French representative is Premier Laval, and the Italian representative is Aloisi, who recently attended the League of Nations Executive Council meeting in Geneva. The start of the three-nation conference coincides with large-scale Italian military exercises near the Brenner Pass, a major route from Germany into Italy. Approximately one million soldiers will participate in the exercises, during which the Italian government will test new methods of assaulting enemy positions with specialized military equipment. All movements will be kept strictly secret. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>

<h3 id="e39">Is Rome Also Optimistic About the Paris Three-Nation Conference? Believes Agreement Between Britain and Italy is Possible <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>(Rome) People here are gradually becoming more optimistic about the Anglo-Franco-Italian conference in Paris. When the representatives of Britain, France, and Italy decided in Geneva to convene the Paris three-nation conference based on the 1906 treaty regarding Abyssinia, Italian diplomatic circles believed that the current conference could give Italy sufficient time to steer the Italo-Abyssinian issue onto a basis completely different from the League of Nations' viewpoint. However, the general public initially thought it unlikely that the British government's attitude would lead to a solution satisfactory to Italy. Now, this assessment has slightly changed. Italy has not completely given up hope of reaching a compromise with Britain, because recently some people in Britain have expressed a greater understanding of Italy's demands. According to Italian diplomatic circles, the Paris three-nation conference has not been convened immediately due to the wishes of the British side, as Britain wants to delay the opening date in order to first seek a convergence of views among the countries involved before the conference begins. The semi-official Italian newspaper, "Il Giornale d'Italia," stated that British public opinion on the Abyssinian incident can be divided into two factions: one firmly hostile to Italy, and the other acknowledging that nations other than Britain should have the right to expand their colonies. The newspaper concluded, "European peace depends on Italy's cooperation. This point was raised at the Stresa Conference. If so, then friendship between Britain and Italy will not only benefit Italy, but also benefit Britain." (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to political predictions, the three-nation conference on the Abyssinian issue is planned to be held in Paris on August 16. According to reports from newspapers here, the chief Italian representative will be Aloisi, accompanied by experts on African issues. It is generally believed that Britain's position at this conference will be more difficult than it was in Geneva, because in Geneva, Britain could take a stand based on League of Nations principles and morality, but here it cannot avoid making a more concrete statement. Sources familiar with the matter predict that the Italian representatives will emphasize three points: (1) Italy's past occupation of Eritrea was originally encouraged by Britain, because at that time, while America was conquering Sudan, Italy's occupation of this area could protect America's flank. (2) Although the 1906 Anglo-Franco-Italian treaty nominally aimed to maintain Abyssinia's territorial integrity, its true intention was to divide Abyssinia. (3) The 1925 exchange of notes between the three countries regarding Abyssinia, well after the establishment of the League of Nations, was actually an action to discuss the spheres of influence of the three countries in Abyssinia. Therefore, Britain has never considered itself a protector of Abyssinia. Italian officials observe that it will be difficult to erase these facts, so Britain should be able to be more realistic at this conference, and not just preach high-sounding principles. Furthermore, according to news from London, there is an increasing number of British veterans, doctors, engineers, and various craftsmen requesting the Italian embassy to allow them to join the Italian army for the conquest of Abyssinia. While the embassy expresses satisfaction with this situation, whether or not they are needed will be decided by the Italian government. (National News Agency dispatch, 8th)</p>
<h3 id="e40">Abyssinia Discloses War Plans Intends to Win Decisively in the South <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Addis Ababa A responsible, non-official source today revealed to a Reuters correspondent Abyssinia's war plans against Italy. If this plan is adopted, the Abyssinian Emperor will not defend against the Italian army on the Eritrean or Italian Somaliland fronts. Instead, he will gather his main force near the Italian Somaliland border. When the Italian army invades Abyssinia from Eritrea, the Abyssinian Emperor will also attack from his base, hoping to win in the south and offset the losses in the north. Only a small number of troops will be stationed in the north, intending to adopt guerrilla tactics, with the sole purpose of hindering the enemy. Mobilization is progressing gradually, but continuous heavy rain makes troop movements extremely difficult. Often, a hundred-mile journey takes more than half a month to complete. The Abyssinian army's total strength is uncertain, even to the Abyssinian government. However, reliable estimates put the total number at approximately 750,000 men. They are not all equipped with modern weapons, and their organization is not entirely perfect. Many foreigners are currently volunteering for service in the Abyssinian government, but only a few experts are being recruited. 3,000 gas masks recently ordered from Germany have arrived, and another 25,000 are en route. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa According to information obtained by a Havas News Agency correspondent stationed in the capital, the Abyssinian army is divided into seven routes: (1) The Northern Route Army is commanded by Prince Siyyum, grandson of former Emperor Yohannes. (2) The Southern Route Army is commanded by Prince Desta, the Emperor's son-in-law. (3) The Central-Eastern Route Army is commanded by General Nasibu, former Governor of the capital. (4) The Western Route Army is commanded by Prince Emiru. (5) The Central-Western Route Army is commanded by Prince Kassa. (6) The Eastern Route Army is commanded by Crown Prince Asfaw Wossen. (7) There is another route, whose details are unknown. Each route army is divided into thirty regiments, with approximately 3,000 soldiers per regiment, for a total force of over 600,000 men. Of these, only 250,000 are equipped with government-issued firearms and ammunition. The total number of rifles is disputed, ranging from approximately 300,000 to 1 million. It is generally believed that Abyssinia has 200 cannons of various types, some of which are old-fashioned cannons from the 1860s. In addition, there are approximately 400 machine guns and a roughly equal number of light machine guns, as well as eight aircraft, only six of which are usable. As for the troops currently concentrated in the northern provinces, they were not mobilized by government order. Soldiers from the northern provinces believe that their provinces will bear the brunt of any conflict, so they have voluntarily joined the local commanders in those provinces to prepare to meet the enemy.

<p>Addis Ababa An American black aviator nicknamed "Harlem's Black Eagle" voluntarily organized an Abyssinian air force, but initially caused displeasure by damaging the aircraft during his first flight with a brand new plane. He has now regained favor, although his flying skills are not particularly impressive, as he previously served in the military training new recruits. (National News Agency dispatch, 7th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Regarding the outcome of the negotiations for the rescue of British journalist Jones, as of today, the Chahar Provincial Government has not yet received a report from those responsible for the negotiations. According to sources familiar with the matter, the bandits are holding Jones near the Chahar-Jehol border and moving him around constantly, without a fixed address. It is believed that someone within the bandits is intercepting him, and the areas where the bandits travel are not accessible to our security forces. Currently, Zhang Yunji and others, who are responsible for negotiating with the bandits on behalf of the Chahar Provincial Government, are in contact with the bandits somewhere near Guyuan. However, due to the bandits' treachery and lack of sincerity, continued efforts are still needed. Reports that Jones has escaped are confirmed to be speculation. The British Embassy in Beiping is very concerned about this matter. Yesterday and today, they sent personnel to the Beiping Political Affairs Reorganization Committee Military Branch and the Japanese Embassy Military Attaché's Office to discuss all aspects. Japanese Military Attaché Takahashi has telegraphed Chengde to inquire whether there are bandits holding Jones in Jehol, hoping to rescue him locally, but has not yet received a reply from Chengde. (Special dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Authorities are finding it extremely difficult to handle the Jones kidnapping case. The kidnappers appear to have handed Jones over to another group of bandits. It is reported that the new bandits are demanding a ransom of 100,000 yuan. Jones has probably been taken to the Chahar-Jehol border, but the exact location is difficult to ascertain, as the kidnappers are constantly moving. The authorities are currently doing everything possible to contact the new bandits. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>

<h3 id="e87">Western Shandong Disaster Area: Over 300 Li Wide; Representatives from Ten Counties Gather in Jining to Discuss Relief; Wang Shaochang Hopes Central Government Will Effectively Block the Breach <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Jinan correspondence, according to a long-distance telephone call from Jining, since the Yellow River breached in Juancheng, the flood has been rushing southeast. For three weeks, the flood has been spreading, and half of western Shandong has been submerged. The disaster area covers more than ten counties, with a width of over 300 li from east to west and a length of 250 li from north to south, a vast expanse of water. Moreover, the breaches are not blocked, and the water source is abundant, continuing to spread. It is unknown where it will end. Millions of disaster victims are gathering in Jining every day, no less than 20,000 to 30,000 people. Representatives from ten counties, including Zhengcheng, Zhangcheng, Juye, Jiaxiang, Heze, Jining, Dongping, Wenshang, Jinxiang, and Yutai, gathered in Jining to discuss the Yellow River disaster relief issue. Wang Shaochang, director of the Shandong County Administration Construction Experimental Zone, believes that if the breaches are not blocked for one day, the Yellow River disaster will not be reduced for one day. He took the opportunity of Shandong Construction Director Zhang Honglie attending the Yellow River prevention and control meeting in Beijing to send a telegram to Zhang, asking him to describe the disaster situation in western Shandong in detail in Beijing, in order to urge the central government to pay close attention and take effective measures to block the breaches. He also hoped that the central government would send an envoy to console the 4.5 million starving disaster victims. The wording was earnest, with every word a tear. The original text is recorded below.</p>
<p>To Brother Zhang Youshan, Shandong Construction Director, Nanjing Central Hotel: Yesterday, after shaking hands in farewell, I immediately sent the proposed measures to universally rescue the disaster victims. This morning, the county magistrates and representatives of the heavily affected counties, totaling ten counties including Juancheng, Yuncheng, Juye, Jiaxiang, Heze, Jining, Dongping, Wenshang, Jinxiang, and Yutai, gathered at this office to discuss the Yellow River disaster issue. Feeling that the submersion and blocking of the breaches are not imminent, I humbly believe that you are responsible for the construction of the entire province and are currently responsible for controlling the Yellow River. I dare to inform you of the severity of the disaster in the ten counties under the jurisdiction of this district office, and its impact on the overall national situation and national consciousness. I hope that the leading figures of the central government and the Party, as well as the people of Qilu who are staying in Beijing, will investigate. Since July 10, when the Yellow River breached at Dongzhuang, Juancheng, with four breaches, it has been flowing eastward, vast and boundless, taking seven-tenths of the entire river's flow. In less than ten days, northern Heze and southern Juancheng have become wetlands. It spread eastward to Yuncheng, Juye, and Jiaxiang, covering 300 li from east to west and 80 to 250 li from north to south. The county towns of the three counties only remain in the middle of the vast flood. The Yellow River reached Wang Laohu Village and divided into three streams. One stream headed towards Dongping and Wenshang, irrigating West Lake in Dongping. One stream headed north of Jining City, irrigating Nanwang Lake, endangering Jining County. One stream headed between Jining and Jinxiang, overflowing the Zhao Wang River and entering the Nanyang, Dushan, and Zhaoyang Lakes, blocked by the North Jiangsu dam, turned north and stagnated. The Nanyang Lake dam in southern Yutai collapsed in August. The Yellow River rushed like thunder, directly hitting Yutai County. The county magistrate was so angry that he wanted to die and almost sacrificed himself. This stream has the potential to seep westward from Shan County and enter the old Yellow River course in southern Henan and northern Jiangsu. Moreover, Heze Zhengcheng frequently reported that the second breach was expanding northward, and the fifth and sixth breaches were as wide as 500 zhang. At this time of summer and autumn with heavy rainfall, there is no hope of closure. The number of disaster victims in the ten counties is 4.5 million. The disaster area covers over 300 li from east to west and 250 li from north to south, completely submerged. In the face of such an unprecedented catastrophe, I have not heard of any overall relief efforts, but only seen neighboring provinces building dams. Among these 4.5 million people, the number of people gradually gathering at the Jining Station to wait for relief every day is no less than 20,000. The provincial government sent five trains to transport them to various counties, but it was still insufficient. However, this is limited to the old and weak. The able-bodied men crouching on the roofs and treetops, and the hundreds of thousands of people struggling on the embankments, are burning with hunger, soaked in rain, and resentful. They have gone from disappointment to resentment towards the state and local officials. These hundreds of thousands of resentful people may not choose the advantages and disadvantages and take risks. This is something that Shaochang dares not expect. The smoke and Yellow River water are deepening the harm to the people of Lu. The people of Lu are not worthy of pity, but if the breaches are not blocked, the water will continue to flow eastward, increasing without decreasing. Even if it does not seize the canal and enter the Huai, the lack of water in Jining has already approached the Tianjin-Pukou Railway line, and the Hanzhuang Station is gradually being affected. The water overflowing from the Yutai Lake bank is flowing southwest, disrupting the Longhai Railway line from Jinxiang, Shan, and Cao. It is a matter of days. Shaochang cares about the overall situation, grieves for his hometown, and dares not fail to report what he feels is dangerous. I am willing to take advantage of my trip to Beijing to relay the situation on your behalf. If it can urge the central government to pay close attention and take effective measures to block the breaches, and send an envoy to console these 4.5 million people, then I will accept the grace gratefully. Not only will the people of this part of Shandong be fortunate, but the revival of the entire nation's consciousness in the Yellow River and Huai River basins and the national transportation will depend on it. I am telegraphing urgently and feel extremely apprehensive. Brother Wang Shaochang bows with respect.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Guangdong Province: Three Rivers Experience Another Flash Flood; Low-Lying Areas Along the Rivers Inundated; Vast Expanse of Water Along the Guangzhou-Kowloon and Guangdong-Hankou Railways <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence, the East, West, and North Rivers in Guangdong Province had just receded in mid-July, but unexpectedly at the end of the month, there were more than ten days of continuous heavy rain in various places, and flash floods broke out in the river basins. The river water gradually rose. It was found that in the upper reaches of the East River, torrential rain started on July 30 and lasted for three days and nights. By the 3rd of this month, the water level had risen by more than five feet again, a total increase of more than eleven feet. The average water depth in Heyuan, Wuhua, Longchuan, Laolong, and Huizhou and Guanyinge in the upper reaches was over a zhang, and all the fields along the river were inundated. The water depth in various villages outside the southeast gate of Heyuan County was five to six feet, and all places in Da Yuanling and Luocun were flooded. Low-lying areas in Taiping Middle Road, Bajiao River Estuary, and Niugang Street in the city were also flooded to the knees. Hengli, Qingzhou, and Nanmen Townships, Xiangyi Market, Yangshan New Market, Qinglongtan, Baini Pond, and Xiami Street, Xihu Huanhu, and Luxiushui Lake in Huiyang County became giant pools. Residents moved furniture by boat in a state of chaos. Su Village, Xiana, and Ma Si in Boluo County also became wetlands. Rice fields near Shilong in Dongguan can also be traversed by boat. The mature rice waves seen along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway have now turned into a scene of water and sky, and the losses to agricultural production are significant. All main and county roads in the eastern district were blocked by water and could not be used. The upper reaches of the North River have been discharging flash floods for days, and the Zhen River in Shaozhou has failed to act as a flood discharge outlet, so the flood spread to Qujiang, Yingde, and Qingyuan counties. Several sections of the south section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway had their tracks washed away and were temporarily closed to traffic. The floodwater near the villages along the Guangdong Railway was as high as thirty feet, and the shallowest places were also about two zhang. The upper section of Shaozhou Road was only repaired on the 2nd, and normal traffic resumed on the 3rd. However, the bus route on the Yingde branch line has not yet resumed. Most of the shops in Yingde Town were flooded to the second floor, and people traveled by boat, which greatly affected business. The number of fields and huts that were flooded is countless. Yesterday, Yingde County Magistrate Tan Yuanchao telegraphed to report the disaster as follows: "The flood in the county has risen to more than two zhang, and the trend is still continuing. The county seat and the villages along the river have become wetlands. Six percent of the early rice has been submerged, and all the late rice seedlings have been flooded. The number of people drowned will be reported in detail. Please allocate funds to provide relief to the disaster victims. Yingde County Magistrate Tan Yuanchao bows." Also, the Yingde County Party Department telegraphed on the 2nd, saying, "The flash flood has risen to more than two zhang. Ripe rice, new seedlings, houses, and livestock have been almost completely submerged. Wails of sorrow can be heard everywhere, and people are waiting to be fed." Also, the northern flood at 2:00 PM has poured into the villages of Qingyuan and Hu Jiang, which bear the brunt of the disaster. At 10:00 PM on the 2nd, the water outside the Qingyuan County seat reached the knees, and most of the shops inside and outside the city closed to avoid the flood. The Sanjiaoji and Huatang dikes on the opposite bank of the county seat were washed away by the water, and fields and houses were submerged. In addition, the Binjiang area and the Buhui area were all flooded, and vegetables and grains were completely lost. The Qingyuan to Yinzhangou road and the Qingyuan to Yangshan road had their roadbeds destroyed by the water, and buses were temporarily suspended, making transportation extremely inconvenient. On the West River side, which was the most severely affected by the previous flood, the accumulated water had just receded when flash floods arrived again. Zhaoqing City was also hit by a hurricane on the evening of the 20th of last month, and most of the overhead power lines were destroyed. The number of small boats with broken masts and sails was also large. Near Foshan in Nanhai County, rainwater flooded all 28 villages in Funanbao and 21 villages in Xilongbao in the Ninth District, and the fields were submerged in water. The streets of Foshan Town were also two feet deep in water, and transportation in nearby villages was by boat. At present, the water in the upper reaches of the West River is still rushing in. The water level in Foshan has risen by more than two zhang from July 26 to the 2nd of this month. If it rains again, it will be easy to repeat the disaster of the previous time. (August 4)</p>

<p>Jinan correspondence, in Shijiazhuang, northeast of Gaotang County, northern Shandong, a farmer named Liu Zhizu (courtesy name Changle) has a black mule. In the spring of the year before last, it suddenly gave birth to a colt with a strange shape and a sensitive and intelligent nature, able to understand human language and run extremely fast. People call it a thousand-li colt. Liu also treasures it like a precious jewel. This spring, upon hearing people say that Wang Yilan in Tianjin (who had studied in the United States) was good at training livestock, such as mules, horses, dogs, and sheep, and could teach them various skills, Liu transported it to Tianjin, which was reported in newspapers at the time. Recently, Liu Jiesan, the nephew of Liu Zhizu, came to Jinan and told Shandong Provincial Chairman Han Fuju that he intended to sell the colt, but because this rare animal was produced in Shandong, it should be preserved in Shandong Province. Han agreed with this, so he sent Adjutant Guan Shilian to Tianjin to negotiate with Liu Zhizu, and then transported the mule and colt to Jinan yesterday (the 6th). Liu and his nephew also came. Liu and others arrived in Jinan at 4:30 PM. Upon hearing the news, people at the station rushed to see it, and the crowd was so large that it was difficult to move. Then Liu led it to the provincial government. From the station, through Er Ma Road, Puhe Gate, Guhuashi Street, and West Main Street, the viewers along the way were like a wall. Some even came from outside the city to see it. The police, fearing that the crowd would cause chaos, tried their best to maintain order. In front of the provincial government's auditorium, Advisor Han Guansan first tried to ride it, and it was indeed very brave and different from ordinary animals. Chairman Han also visited it in front of his office. The owner then ordered the colt to perform various skills, first calling its name, then making it perform handshakes (raising its hooves very high to shake hands), bowing, asking for peace, picking up objects with its mouth, turning forward, turning backward, turning left and right halfway, various turning methods, various walking methods, and walking four characters, walking sideways, running, riding to find objects, and other skills, more than forty kinds in total. As for the walking speed, according to Liu Zhizu, it travels one li per minute, but during the trial last year, it only walked a few li before it started to sweat, so it was not allowed to continue walking. Based on this calculation, it should be able to travel 60 li per hour. The unique points of this colt are many. Its body is gray-red, with long hairs like silver needles. Its legs are thin, its hooves are small, there is a blessing and longevity hair whorl in the middle of its head, there are longevity hair whorls inside and outside the tips of both ears, there is a birth collar hair under its mouth, the hair under its neck grows against the grain, forming a triangle in front, there are eyes in the inner legs, and it always accumulates round or oval-shaped tears. This colt's tears are crescent-shaped, there are short hairs on the bottom of its hooves, and the white pearl hair on its belly resembles scales. From its head to its tail, it is a mane, about an inch high, and its tail is neither donkey-like nor horse-like, resembling bamboo joints.</p>
<p>Chairman Han then returned to his office and called Liu Zhizu and Liu Jiesan in. He first asked about the origin of the colt. According to them, the mother of the colt (a black mule) had been unable to conceive when mated with horses or donkeys in the past. The year before last, it was not mated, but suddenly conceived, and this colt was born on February 2nd. It is said to be a dragon seed, and no one saw it. When this colt was first born, it had a unique shape and was extremely sensitive. It ate more feed and less grass. Now, its milk teeth have fallen out, and it only has two teeth. After this, the mother mule has not been able to conceive. Chairman Han then said, "I first heard people say that this colt was produced in Gaotang, and then I saw it reported in the newspapers. Because I did not plan to buy it, I did not pay attention to it. Otherwise, I would have asked Gaotang County to send it to me to see it earlier. A few days ago, my nephew reported it to me, so I asked them to transport it here for me to see. If you want to sell it, I will keep it, because it is produced in Shandong and should be preserved in Shandong. In fact, I personally do not need this thing." Liu repeatedly said that he was willing to dedicate it to the Chairman. Han said, "If you say you want to give it to me, I will definitely not accept it, because the government will never take a single blade of grass or a piece of wood from the people for free." Finally, Liu Jie said that he had spent more than a thousand yuan on feeding and transporting it to Tianjin over the years. Chairman Han then ordered that a thousand yuan be given to them, and the colt was kept temporarily in the horse stable and one person was left to feed it. The black mule was ordered to be taken back. Liu thanked him and left.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Flood Situation in the Upper Reaches of Anhui Province: Inspection of River Embankment Flood Control; The Situation in the Upper Reaches is More Important Than in the Lower Reaches; Provincial Government Sends Letter to Water Conservancy Agencies Reporting <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Anqing dispatch: This year's river water is rising sharply. The water levels in various places within Anhui Province are almost the same as the highest water levels in the twentieth year of the Republic. The area around Susong County in the upper reaches is even level with the highest water level of the twentieth year. Judging from past experience, the situation of dikes and embankments in Anhui Province is more important in the upper reaches than in the lower reaches, and the left bank of the upper reaches is more important than the right bank. This is because the area has rivers outside and lakes inside, forming a strip of land, with only a special line of earthen dikes acting as a barrier for hundreds of miles. Also, a part of it reaches the intersection of Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces, with long dikes and complicated jurisdictions, making comprehensive prevention difficult. Liu Bohua, Chairman of the Provincial Government, recently took the reported materials, inspected the situation, and sent a letter to the Yangtze River Water Resources Commission and the National Economic Council. The main points of the letter are as follows: (1) Yangjia on the opposite bank of Anqing is the northwest acute angle of Dongliu Guangfeng Embankment, located at the turning point of the river flow, and the terrain is very important. Fortunately, most of the section is sandy, but the embankment body is still thick, so there is no danger. (2) The Dongliu City Protection Embankment is connected to the main embankment and protects the city defense, which is of great importance to the military. After landing and inspecting, the embankment surface is only about two feet away from the water. The west embankment is particularly dangerous. Local gentry should be summoned to mobilize everyone to cooperate in rescue. At the same time, the county magistrate Zhang Zexie should be ordered to increase manpower day and night to raise and thicken the embankment. (3) The line of river embankment from Wangjiang Huayang to Huaining Lao Lake is winding like a belt. Each dike attached to the embankment considers the river embankment outside and prevents mountain floods and lake waves inside, making the work very difficult. At that time, leakage occurred in the Dongxing Embankment, and the Baoxing Embankment was also in danger. The Construction Department had previously issued sacks and cash to urge Wangjiang County to do its best to rescue. Zhen Hua also sent Commissioner Ni Wenzheng with 500 yuan to assist County Magistrate Hong in strengthening prevention and rescue. (4) The four major dikes in Susong County—Tongren, Dingkou, Jingjiang, and Mahua—have been strictly supervised and repaired last year to meet the specified dike standards. The dike surfaces in all places are four or five feet higher than the current water surface, and the inner river and lake dikes are also two or three feet higher than the water surface. However, the soil quality in several places contains sand, which is most prone to leakage. Fortunately, the county magistrate is very diligent in inspections, and the dike-protecting laborers also know how to work hard. The Construction Department has also taught various flood control and rescue methods and distributed materials for preparation, so there should be no danger. (5) The Mahua Embankment is a large dike of common interest to Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces. It has always been repaired by the three provinces according to a percentage share. Last year's repairs were also done separately. This time, the dike breached in Pengze Yujiapu in Jiangxi Province. It was reported that Director Liu of the Construction Department is setting up rescue efforts there. Zhen Hua and others landed at Yujiapu and walked about five li downwards to inspect the breach. The place is located at No. 15 Bao, District 2 of Pengze County, Jiangxi Province, opposite Shima. After inquiring, the breach occurred at 6:00 PM on July 5th. The outer beach collapsed first, followed by the river embankment. Now the river flow is turbulent, scouring and collapsing over a hundred zhang. According to the original dike surface, it was one zhang and five chi wide and six shi chi higher than the current water surface. In theory, it should not have collapsed. It must be that the new dike had not yet settled, and the stone feet of Madang Mountain on the opposite side were pressing, causing rapid currents to discharge and lead to seepage. The area is sparsely populated, and it was not detected beforehand, so it was difficult to recover from the breach. Now the river flow is overflowing. If it is not blocked and built up quickly, it will endanger the inner dike and harm eight counties in Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces. It has been decided by the Chairman of your Commission, the Secretary-General of the National Economic Council Qin, and the Chief Engineer of the Jiangxi Water Conservancy Bureau Qiu to draw up four draft plans for blocking the breach. The Jiangxi Water Conservancy Bureau will first handle the package head work. In addition to sending personnel from the Engineering Department and members for purchasing and transporting materials, our province will also order Susong and Wang counties to send laborers to assist in the work. In addition, the entire river embankment is still intact (note that dikes that collapse during violent floods are not included). If there is no more violent rise, the strength of the dikes can still be barely supported. In addition to continuing to supervise the responsible departments and all county officials and people to step up protection, I have inspected the dike situation in the upper reaches of Anhui Province and hereby inform you for your reference, and request that you follow the four agreed principles for the blocking of the Mahua Embankment, immediately send engineering personnel to guide, and transfer to the National Economic Council to allocate the required construction funds.

<p>Songjiang: Revision of Household Registration Change Reporting</p>
<p>Our province is implementing the Baojia system. All counties in the province have completed the three-level organization. The township Baojia chiefs have all been legally produced. They should take over the investigation and reporting of household registration changes. According to the original method, the Jia chiefs verbally reported to the Bao chiefs, who reported to the township office and then to the district office. After compiling the statistics, they were submitted to the county for record. Only in this way can the accuracy of the household registration be ensured. According to the law, household registration changes are divided into eight categories: relocation, birth, death, marriage, inheritance, separation, employment, and disappearance. Now the provincial order has been revised to four items, roughly divided into increases and decreases in households and increases and decreases in population. It is reported that all districts will be notified to comply.</p>
<p>Kunshan: Farmers in Beicun Robbed by Bandits</p>
<p>At the home of farmer Ma Jinsheng in Beicun, about two li from Zhangpu Town, at about 1:00 AM the other night, six or seven bandits suddenly broke through the wall, speaking in local dialect and holding weapons. The Ma family members were all asleep. When they jumped up, they were confined to a room by the bandits, who scared them into silence. Then they entered the room to search and rob. Neighbors heard the noise and sounded the gong to warn. The bandits fled with their loot. By the time the villagers came to arrest them, the bandits had gone far away. Upon checking, the lost items totaled more than 300 yuan in silver and banknotes. Yesterday morning, Ma came to the city to report to the county government to investigate and arrest the fleeing bandits.</p>
<p>Suzhou: Suzhou City Plans to Open Public Buses</p>
<p>The transportation industry in Suzhou is progressing daily. The Sujia Highway has long been open to traffic. The Suchang, Sukun, and Sumu highways will also be open to traffic one after another in the coming days. The main roads inside and outside the city have been completed by sixty to seventy percent. The opening of Xiangmen and the reconstruction of Banmen are expected to be completed within the year, and the road can also circulate around the city. The Jiangsu Provincial Highway Department is planning to operate public buses inside and outside Suzhou City in the spring of next year. The Wuxian Construction Bureau is currently planning everything. However, the rickshaw drivers' association believes that the operation of public buses inside and outside the city has a great impact on the rickshaw business. Moreover, the Construction Bureau added 500 rickshaw licenses two years ago. At that time, the association raised 80,000 yuan to purchase the licenses and signed a contract stipulating that public buses should not be operated inside and outside the city within three years. Therefore, they plan to ask the Construction Department to postpone the operation of public buses. However, the authorities believe that this contract has expired and is invalid, so it is unlikely to achieve their goal.</p>
<p>Prosecution of Police Officers for Conspiring to Murder for Money</p>
<p>The case of Gu Agen, a devotee of the Zhou family nunnery in Guan Zai Nong, who was killed, has caused a sensation in society. Whether it was suicide or murder is unclear. The court believes it was murder and that the police chief of the jurisdiction is a major suspect. The Public Security Bureau believes it was suicide. The Public Security Bureau has transferred and detained the suspects, Inspector Hong Shiqin and Patrol Chief Xu Baosheng, to the court for interrogation. The prosecutor has concluded the investigation and prosecuted Inspector Hong Shiqin and Patrol Chief Xu Baosheng for inciting murder, intimidating and defrauding property, and forging documents and dereliction of duty; Police Officer He Naikang for murder and forgery; Police Officer Yang Shunfu for intimidation and dereliction of duty; and Tie Xie Qianshugang for forgery. The criminal court will publicly try the case immediately. It is also reported that Yan Lian, the director of the First Public Security Bureau in charge, has resigned due to negligence. The major suspicious case has now come to light. As for Hong Shiqin's motive for killing Gu, it was because Wang Weinong, who had absconded with money, was hiding there. It was rumored that there were thirty jin of banknotes hidden there, so he started to plot for money. Wang will now be escorted to the Shanghai court for questioning.</p>
<p>Wuxi: Strict Prohibition of Electric Hair Perming</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau held a police affairs meeting yesterday. Chairman Chen Yuchu decided: (1) The police officers who graduated from the Police Training School are still assigned to the third-level police service. Some of them apply for resignation for no reason or deliberately neglect their duties in order to be dismissed, which goes against the original purpose of the training. Strict restrictions should be imposed, and the graduation certificates should be recovered. (2) Ms. Gu from Dongmen died from injuries sustained from an electric hair perm. Hair perms are against the principles of the new life of simplicity and frugality, and electric perms cause significant losses in terms of economy and time. Now that there has been a death from electric perming, it should be strictly prohibited. There are three or four businesses in the city that use electric hair perming, such as Dahua. It has been decided to order them to be investigated and prohibited to prevent life-threatening risks and maintain the new life movement.</p>
<p>Reporters' Association Elects Petition Representatives</p>
<p>The Municipal Journalists' Association held a temporary members' meeting yesterday afternoon. Chairman Sun Dexian decided: (1) Sun Xiangfeng, Wu Guanchong, Hua Jinji, and Sun Dexian were elected as representatives to petition in Beijing to amend the Publication Law, and Jiang Zhongliang, Su Xingwu, Shi Qinglin, Zhou Hanquan, Wang Xiehui, and Fan Liqi were elected to receive colleagues from other counties who came to Wuxi to gather. (2) Chen Hongjun and others proposed that an article in the Shanghai Journalism Quarterly defamed and slandered the entire journalism community in Wuxi by publishing the history and current situation of the news industry in various places. It was decided to appoint Jiang Zhongliang and Chen Hongjun to handle the litigation.</p>
<p>Haimen: Adultery Leads to Murder</p>
<p>Zhang, the wife of Zhu Shaodong, a villager in Le, District Six (i.e., Zhang), is in her thirties. She is quite promiscuous and restless. She had an affair with her neighbor Ni Zhaozhen two years ago, and they were in close contact. Recently, she became acquainted with a young neighbor, Liu Guomin. Ni found out about the affair and was extremely angry. On the afternoon of the fifth, he took advantage of Liu and Zhang's secret rendezvous to gather Ni Shisheng, Ni Shaoying, Fan Longgou, Li Wenxiu, and Zhang Xuewen to catch the adulterers. Liu was awakened from his sleep and tried to break through to escape, but he accidentally fell into the river and drowned. More than ten soldiers from the Third Security Brigade stationed in Fu'an Town were patrolling and learned the truth. They arrested Ni Zhaozhen, Ni Shisheng, Ni Shaoying, Fan Longgou, Li Wenxiu, Zhang Xuewen, Zhu Shaodong, and Zhu Zhang and took them to the brigade headquarters. Yesterday afternoon, they were sent to the county government for interrogation. Chen, the adjudicator, went to Qian yesterday morning to conduct the investigation.</p>
<p>Nantong: Using the Baojia System to Investigate and Suppress Opium and Drugs</p>
<p>The six counties of Tong, Ru, Chong, Hai, Jing, and Qi decided to use the Baojia system to investigate and suppress opium and drugs after a meeting on drug investigation and suppression. It was stipulated that the Baojia chiefs should report all private opium smokers, drug users, and suspected traffickers and manufacturers in their respective Baojia within one month, with a pledge of joint liability, and report to the county government for search. Baojia chiefs who know the situation but do not report will be punished according to the severity of the circumstances.</p>
<p>Verdict in the Case of Hiding a Lover in a Cellar</p>
<p>Zhai Hede from Jinsha had an incestuous relationship with his niece Xiao. Unable to elope together, he dug a cellar at home, set up beds, tables, and stools inside, and covered it with a reed shed to hide his niece. The girl's father discovered it and filed a lawsuit with the court. The criminal court sentenced Qu Hede to months in prison for enticing the girl.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Letter to the Editor <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Dear Editor, I was shocked to read the news "The Danbao Newspaper Office was Destroyed..." in your newspaper's Kunshan dispatch on the 7th of this month. After investigation, the Kunshan Daily was established by the shareholders who elected Lu Jiandan, Jin Chenglu, and Chen Fengge to jointly apply for registration. All the necessary items used by the Daily Newspaper Office were borrowed from the Chenbao Newspaper Office by Cheng Liu, with Chen Fengge, Zou De, Xu Liangqiu as guarantors (with IOUs to prove). Now, due to illegal acts by internal personnel, Cheng Liu and Fengge exercised their powers and decided to temporarily suspend publication from August 3rd in order to thoroughly rectify the situation. On the afternoon of the 4th, they went to the office to return all the necessary items borrowed from the Chenbao Newspaper Office in order to complete the procedures. The destruction reported in your newspaper is completely untrue. Fearing that the outside world does not know the truth, we hereby clarify the facts and hope that you will correct the letter accordingly. Jin Chenglu, Chen Fengge, Zou Xiaotan, jointly. August 7th.</p>

<h3 id="e92">Fundraising for Provincial Flood Relief Association: Inaugural Meeting Held Yesterday; Declaration for Donations Passed, Organizational Regulations Approved; Request Made to City Government to Advise Unification of Disaster Relief Organizations <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai society, recognizing the severity of this year's floods, initiated the establishment of the Shanghai Fundraising Association for Provincial Flood Relief. The inaugural meeting was held yesterday (the 8th) at 4:00 PM at the Renji Hall on Yunnan Road. Over a hundred leaders from various sectors of the city attended. Mayor Wu presided over the meeting, which promptly approved the association's personnel, organizational regulations, and a declaration. Several important resolutions regarding fundraising for flood relief were also discussed. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees: Leaders from Various Sectors</p>
<p>The leaders from various sectors who attended yesterday's inaugural meeting included Wu Tiecheng, Xu Shiying, Song Ziliang, Huang Renzhi, Lu Wen'an, Wang Peiyuan, Shu Chushi, Du Ruisheng, Wang Xiaolai, Chen Timin, Monk Chidian, Peng Yuncen, Tang Renxin, Chen Liangyu, Shi Weidu, Wen Lanting, Shen Tianxin, Gu Xinyi, Li Dachao, Lu Bohong, Huang Bodu, Qu Wenliu, Li Zizai, Zhao Yiwu, Li Wuyun, Baker, Quan Shaowu, Chen Jicheng, Cheng Jingsheng, Pan Xulun, Zhao Duanyuan, Zhu Xiecheng, Yin Guanzhi, Chen Binhe, Han Juemin, Wang Yiting, Wu Yunzhai, Chen Lengseng, Yu Zuoting, Qian Zhonghua, Chu Huiseng, Pan Zhe, Sun Choucheng, Wang Dizhai, Jiang Qingfan, Qian Xinzhi, and others, totaling over a hundred people.</p>
<p>Wu Tiecheng Elected Temporary Chairman</p>
<p>The meeting commenced at 4:00 PM, with attendees electing Mayor Wu as chairman. After customary formalities, Chairman Wu delivered a report, stating that since the beginning of summer this year, the Yangtze and Yellow River basins have experienced successive floods, severely impacting the lives and property of people on both banks. Chairman Xu personally traveled to the disaster areas, braving the heat to conduct detailed inspections, a spirit that is deeply admirable. Our country has suffered from disasters almost every year in recent years, leading to extreme social and economic decline. Shanghai, since the January 28th Incident, has seen sluggish industrial and commercial activity, but it is still fortunate compared to the inland areas. However, Shanghai's prosperity depends on the recovery of the inland economy. I often say that Shanghai is like a fish, and the inland is like water. A fish without water cannot survive. Therefore, if we want to restore Shanghai's prosperity, we must rely on alleviating the distress of the inland areas. Since the lives of Shanghai people are better than those of the inland people, we should still do our best to fulfill our obligation of mutual assistance in the same boat. This year's flood is more severe than the flood of 1931. This year, Shanghai's economic situation is worse than in 1931, so we should work harder to ensure that this year's results are better than in previous years.</p>
<p>Xu Shiying Reports on the Disaster Situation</p>
<p>Following this, Xu Shiying reported, stating that since mid-June of this year, continuous torrential rains have fallen in the provinces along the Yangtze River, causing flash floods. Provinces such as Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui have experienced either prolonged waterlogging or the collapse of dikes, inundating fields and washing away people and livestock. The disaster situation is extremely dire. I personally inspected the disaster areas and witnessed the tragic conditions. According to reports, the number of affected counties is as follows: Hubei has 51 counties and cities, Hunan has 37 counties, including 15 severely affected counties, Jiangxi has 48 counties, including 13 severely affected counties, and Anhui has 13 counties. The number of disaster victims is 7.15 million in Hubei, 4.1 million in Hunan, and over 300,000 in Anhui, bringing the total, including Jiangxi, to over 14 million people. The affected area, including severely and lightly affected areas, is estimated to reach 100,000 square kilometers. The extent of farmland inundation can be inferred from this. The number of people drowned is also over 100,000. The total direct and indirect public and private losses are estimated to be no less than 500 million yuan. Moreover, the flood-stricken areas, such as Tianmen, Hanchuan, Jianli, Shishou, and Gong'an counties in Hubei, and Changde and Nanxian counties in Hunan, are known for their rich agricultural production. This devastating flood has wiped out their vitality, and relief is urgently needed. Now, the Yellow River basin, including Shandong, Hebei, and Henan, has also reported disasters, with damage comparable to that of Hunan and Jiangxi provinces. I will continue to inspect those areas. Various sectors of this city have initiated the establishment of the Fundraising Association for Provincial Flood Relief, which is established today. We hope to raise funds as soon as possible to provide relief to the disaster victims. Xu also reported that before the establishment of this association, various parties had already generously donated large sums of money to Renji Hall for relief purposes. These donations will be handed over to this association for disaster relief. Mr. Wang Yiting has already raised 14,534.45 yuan from various parties. Compatriots from Singapore donated 20,000 yuan. The Jincheng Cinema in this city will donate all ticket revenue from today (yesterday) to this association for disaster relief. After Xu's report, Biao Fucheng stood up and proposed that in the future, for overseas compatriots, Mr. Zhu Ziqiao be invited to go to Southeast Asia to conduct fundraising. The chairman indicated acceptance.</p>
<p>Standing in Mourning for Compatriots Who Perished</p>
<p>At this time, Huang Renzhi stood up and stated that listening to Chairman Xu's report on the tragic situation in the disaster areas was unsettling. It is not difficult for us to imagine that the compatriots in the disaster areas are suffering greatly. We are fortunate to be able to live here peacefully. We should do our best to find ways to provide relief to our disaster-stricken compatriots. I request that everyone present stand up and observe three minutes of silence, both to mourn the compatriots who perished and to think of a proper relief plan for the compatriots in distress. The entire assembly unanimously agreed and stood in silence for three minutes.</p>
<p>Declaration of Inaugural Meeting Passed</p>
<p>The declaration of the inaugural meeting was then discussed and the following original text was passed: Since the beginning of summer this year, continuous torrential rains have fallen, causing flash floods. The Yangtze, Huai, Yellow, and Han rivers have all reported disasters successively, with urgent requests for relief pouring in. The situation is extremely dire. The affected areas in Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces cover more than 150 counties, with over 100,000 people drowned and over 14 million disaster victims awaiting relief. Public and private losses are estimated to be no less than 500 million yuan. Moreover, the expansion of the disaster situation in Shandong, Henan, and Hebei provinces is not yet included. The severity of the disaster even surpasses the flood of 1931. Are not all those crying out for food our brothers and sisters? Knowing that the social economy is already struggling, we are compelled by conscience to provide relief out of brotherly affection and cannot bear to sit idly by. Therefore, we are initiating charitable relief, hoping to provide assistance. We hope that with everyone's efforts, we can overcome the difficulties and prove that human effort can conquer nature. We urge kind-hearted people from all walks of life at home and abroad to take immediate action and share their feelings of hunger and thirst, promoting the desire for universal salvation and relief. We ask for continuous donations of grain, money, and supplies. This association vows to do its best, be practical and realistic, and strive to live up to expectations, alleviate the disaster, and save lives. We have many intentions but no tears to shed. We offer these sincere words and hope for your understanding.</p>

<p>Xu Shiying Departs on the 10th Finally, Vice President Xu Shiying stood up and reported to the assembly that he would leave Shanghai tomorrow (the 10th) to inspect the disaster-stricken provinces in the Yellow River basin, and would not be able to return to Shanghai for about two weeks. After departing from Shanghai on the 10th, he would first go to Beijing to meet with the authorities and allocate relief funds to various provinces. Afterwards, he would depart from Beijing to inspect the situation, and would report to the association by telegram at any time.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Typhoon Warning Signal Raised by Customs Yesterday; However, According to Father Gherzi's Prediction, the Wind Will Not Be Strong When It Passes Through This Morning <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>According to the Greater Shanghai Evening News yesterday, the typhoon has not dissipated despite passing over a long stretch of land. According to Father Gherzi of the Xujiahui Observatory, it will pass through the area slightly west of Shanghai tonight (the 8th) or tomorrow morning (the 9th). Therefore, this port will experience occasional showers, but there will be no excessive wind. Approximately when the typhoon passes through, there will be strong northeast and southeast winds. This typhoon came from the ocean, passed through Taiwan, and entered the Fujian coast near Xiamen. It seems to have the characteristic of dissipating over land. Its direction turned north or northeast, and it will apparently pass through the border between Jiangxi and Zhejiang. Now it is believed that because it has traveled a long distance over land, the wind force has weakened significantly. Heavy rain fell frequently in this port in the second half of last night (the 7th), and the weather is still cloudy today (the 8th), with occasional rain. The temperature has been greatly reduced. According to the Xujiahui Observatory, the maximum temperature for the whole day was only 85.5 degrees.</p>
<p>Customs Raised Ball Around 2:00 AM yesterday morning, there was heavy rain in this port, which later stopped and started. At about 3:00 PM, wind and rain hit, and the waves outside Wusongkou were dangerous. The waves also rose in the Huangpu River. The Customs issued a typhoon warning signal at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon. The Shipping Office raised a black ball on the flagpole of the Customs bell tower so that ships could recognize it.</p>
<p>All Ships Suspended Yesterday evening, all ships that should have departed for the Jianghai were suspended due to the warning. The Ningbo-bound Sanbei's Ningxing, China Merchants' Xin Jiangtian, Yangtze River-bound China Merchants' Jianghua, Taikoo's Datong, Jardine's Xin Pinghe, Beiyang-bound China Merchants' Hairui, Taikoo's Dingsheng, Nanhua-bound Taikoo's Yuezhou, Fuzhou-bound Sanbei's Wanxiang, and Wintai-bound Lian'an's Chuanshan, etc., are all known to have been unable to sail. And the ships that should have arrived yesterday, such as Taikoo's Hong Kong-bound Niuzhuang, Hong Kong-Shantou-bound Haikou, Hong Kong-Fuzhou-bound Sichuan, China Merchants Bureau's Tianjin-Yantai-bound Xin Feng, and Qingdao-bound Anxing, etc., were unable to arrive on schedule due to the typhoon.</p>
<p>Precautions Against High Tides State-run China Merchants Bureau, privately-run Sanbei Shipping Company, Ning Shao Shipping Company, British Taikoo Shipping Company, Jardine Shipping Company, and Japanese Nisshin Company jointly decided yesterday to issue a public notice stating: This is to notify that whether you are a shipper or a consignee, if goods are stored in the above-mentioned shipping companies' own or leased warehouses, we will not be responsible for any damage caused to the goods due to high tides. However, within the possible range, our companies will do our best to protect the goods to avoid damage, but the owner of the goods shall still be responsible for the damage. All expenses incurred by the shipping companies to protect the goods shall also be collected from the owner of the goods when the goods are shipped. This is a special notice, August 8, 1935.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association previously decided to telegraph the Ministry of Communications to advance the issuance of 10 million yuan in navigation bonds to save the shipping industry. Now, the Ministry of Communications' No. 1678 reply states: This case was previously requested by the association's telegram to the Ministry, and the Ministry consulted the Ministry of Finance to investigate the case, allocate funds, and issue bonds, and a reply was issued. Now, the Ministry of Finance's Public Letter No. 16655 replies: This case has already been telegraphed to the Ministry by the Shipping Industry Association. In April of last year, the Ministry replied to the Ministry of Communications that funds were lacking, that transfer was impossible, and that issuing bonds was not feasible at that time. Now, the national treasury is more strapped than before. The request to issue bonds according to the original plan is beyond our capabilities. The industry must find ways to seek relief on its own. The Executive Yuan Secretariat also sent a letter to be jointly reviewed by your Ministry and a reply was also sent, requesting that the case be checked and forwarded to each department. Based on the previous consultation, a corresponding reply is hereby issued for your information. This batch,</p>
<h3 id="e95">Municipal Government Announcement: 100 Mu of Land to Be Requisitioned at Fenglin Bridge for Construction of Zhongshan Hospital <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>According to China News Agency, the baseball field on Route Pére Robert in the French Concession was donated to our country by the board of directors of the American Rockefeller Foundation to build the large-scale Zhongshan Hospital, which was to be presided over by Yan Fuqing. Later, due to obstacles at the site, it was changed to be built near Fenglin Bridge, where more than 100 mu of private land will be requisitioned. The Municipal Government has already submitted it to the Ministry of Interior and issued an announcement for requisition. The announcement reads: The Municipal Land and Health Bureaus, in a report dated May 23, 1935, stated, The Municipal Land Bureau, based on the report of the National Shanghai Medical College and the Shanghai Medical Affairs Board of Directors, reported: To request the Shanghai Municipal Government to forward to the Ministry of Interior for approval to requisition private land for the construction of the Shanghai Zhongshan Hospital and Shanghai Medical College. Our association is preparing to build the Shanghai Zhongshan Hospital to meet the medical needs of the public and to provide practical training for students of Shanghai Medical College to cultivate medical talents. More than 700,000 yuan of construction funds have already been raised, and the board of directors of the American Rockefeller Foundation has donated 130 mu of land on Route Pére Robert in the special district of this city as the site. Recently, due to obstacles, it was decided by the general meeting to change the location to be built on land near Fenglin Bridge in this city. Fenglin Bridge is located in the south of the city, and the population is prosperous, but there is still a lack of good hospitals and medical facilities. The mayor, concerned about the people's suffering, once advocated setting up a hospital there. This is under your administration, which is inspiring. It is found that the boundaries of the eighth map Chengziwei in the South Shanghai District, (1) No. 4, the entire boundary, east to Fenglin Bridge Road, south to Mulonggang, west to Dongmiao Bridge Road, north to Shenjiabang Road, (2) No. 3, the southwest corner, part of the boundary, east to the land of the Shanghai County Education Bureau, south to Shenjiabang Road, west to Dongmiao Bridge Road, north to French Book No. 423, the entire base, can be used as the construction site for Zhongshan Hospital and Shanghai Medical College. However, among them, there are more than 30 owners, and private acquisition is quite difficult. Shanghai Medical College is a national teaching and academic institution, and Zhongshan Hospital is a charitable public welfare institution, and also a practical hospital for Shanghai Medical College. Therefore, in accordance with Article 1 of the Shanghai Municipality Land Requisition Management Regulations and Article 2, Item 7 of the Land Requisition Law, a detailed plan, together with maps and building plans, are prepared and submitted to request verification and forwarding to the Municipal Government to transfer to the Ministry of Interior to allow the requisition of a base of 100 mu within the site to facilitate the construction of the project. Furthermore, the entire construction project of Zhongshan Hospital was contracted early and cannot be delayed. I hope that a quick review will be truly beneficial to both the public and ethics. The reports, along with the attached maps and other documents, were sent to the bureau, which considered that the case concerned the construction of a hospital and medical college, and the requisition of private land was about 100 mu. A letter was immediately sent from the Health Bureau to conduct a detailed review based on the architectural style and a summary of the plan. It was found that the scope of the land proposed to be acquired by the college and others was indeed necessary in fact, and it was reasonable to report the situation and attach the original plan and maps. We request verification and reply, etc. In accordance with Article 2, Item 7 of the Land Requisition Law, it should be approved. In addition to replying for verification, we also request that you instruct us to handle it in accordance with the law. In accordance with the provisions of Article 9 of the same law, the matters to be announced are listed below, so that the public will know. This is a special announcement, with the following details: (1) Sponsor of the business: National Shanghai Medical College and Shanghai Medical Affairs Board of Directors; (2) Type of business: Educational and academic and charitable undertakings; (3) Area where the business is conducted: Eighth map, Chengziwei, South Shanghai District, (1) The entire boundary of No. 4, east to Fenglin Bridge Road, south to Mulonggang, west to Dongmiao Bridge Road, north to Shenjiabang Road, (2) A part of the southwest corner of No. 3, the boundary east to the land of the Shanghai County Education Bureau, south to Shenjiabang Road, west to Dongmiao Bridge Road, north to French Book No. 423, the entire base. The total land requisitioned for the above two places is 100 mu.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Party and Government Organs Maintain Traffic; Limit Rickshaw Pullers to Resume Work; Rickshaw Pullers Obey Orders but Unwilling to Enter the French Concession <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The 40,000 rickshaw pullers of the French Concession, dissatisfied with the registration organized by the French Concession, went on strike on the morning of the 6th. After a conflict, because the French Concession authorities had no intention of canceling the registration, the strike continued yesterday. At the same time, the rickshaw pullers, driven by grief and indignation, pried off the French Concession license plates from public concession vehicles traveling in Nanshi, in order to sanction their undermining of solidarity.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Company Petition</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 9 o'clock, the Rickshaw Guild specially sent representatives Qiu Chunshan, Yu Dajin, Zhang Huaiyang, Zhou Jinyuan, and others, a total of four people, to submit a document to the municipal government in the city center to petition. The Section Chief of the Second Section, Zhang Yiyu, received them. First, they stated the situation of the dispute and the resolutions of the car owners' meeting, requesting negotiation. The municipal government representative promised to ask the mayor for instructions.</p>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Inquiry</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau summoned representatives of the Rickshaw Guild for questioning yesterday. The car dealer representatives Yu Dajin, Qiu Chunshan, and Zhang Huaiyang attended. The Director of the Labor Welfare Division of the Third Section, Wang Gang, and the staff member of the Second Section, Chen Zeyi, held talks. In addition to inquiring about the process, the representatives of the Social Affairs Bureau also stipulated two measures approved by the municipal government: (1) The municipal government is responsible for negotiating the incident, and car dealers and rickshaw pullers should wait for the municipal government to handle it properly. (2) The Social Affairs Bureau is ordered to advise the trade association to inform the rickshaw pullers to resume work uniformly from tomorrow (the 9th).</p>
<p>Party and Government Order</p>
<p>The guild received an order from the Municipal Party Department yesterday, which read: "In order to comply with the matter, it is found that the industry has suspended business without prior approval, affecting traffic, which is already very serious. Now it is heard that there are plans to expand the area of the business suspension, which will further hinder public security. It is hereby urgently ordered that the association comply with and quickly find ways to persuade all business firms under its jurisdiction not to expand the dispute any further, and to instruct all rickshaw pullers to comply as necessary. This order is imperative." The Social Affairs Bureau approved the order, saying that the matter regarding the French Concession's cross-border arrest and the conflict with rickshaw pullers and forced registration has been submitted to the municipal government for negotiation. They should wait for approval and first resume business as soon as possible to maintain traffic and avoid affecting the livelihood of rickshaw pullers. This is the approval.</p>
<p>Industry Meeting</p>
<p>The Rickshaw Trade Association held a committee meeting at its meeting place on Puyu East Road at 3 pm yesterday. More than 20 people attended, chaired by Qiu Chunshan. First, he reported on the process of petitioning the municipal government and the Social Affairs Bureau's inquiry. The party and government authorities ordered the resumption of work as soon as possible to maintain traffic. After discussion, everyone said that they would respect the authorities' intentions and immediately order all car owners to inform the rickshaw pullers to resume work uniformly and wait for the authorities to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Pullers' Meeting</p>
<p>Yesterday at 5 pm, rickshaw pullers held a meeting at Nanmatou, attended by more than 200 people, chaired by Shi Changsheng. First, he reported on the progress of the case and the situation of the car owners being ordered to persuade them to resume work. After discussion: (1) How to proceed with the car owners' announcement of resuming work as soon as possible? It was decided that: (A) uniformly resume work on the morning of the 9th; (B) only allowed to operate in Hubei South, and not allowed to be dragged to the French Concession; (3) the loss of strike time should be requested from the guild to negotiate compensation with the French Concession; (4) the medical expenses of the injured should be borne by the French police; (5) negotiate with the French police to hand over the missing rickshaw puller Xue Er (i.e., Xue Ruji).</p>
<p>Rickshaw Pullers' Statement</p>
<p>Rickshaw puller representative Shi Changsheng expressed his opinion that the French Consul-General's words to Mr. Du were puzzling. Rickshaw pullers did not object to the public concession holding registration. The vehicle license plates were issued by the Public Works Bureau, and the Public Works Bureau had the right to add unified control. The Nanshi small license plates were the license plates and steel seals of the Public Utilities Bureau. The French Concession really had no right to govern them. If it must be held, the vehicles with the public concession license plates should also be registered at the same time to be fair. What if the Public Utilities Bureau also wants to register rickshaw pullers? What should be done? The rickshaw pullers' opinion is that if the Public Utilities Bureau registers rickshaw pullers, they may accept it. If the French Concession registers, at least the vehicles with the public concession license plates should be registered at the same time.</p>
<p>Court Hearing</p>
<p>After rickshaw pullers in Shanghai South and Shanghai West declared a strike on the morning of the 6th due to their opposition to the French Municipal Council's registration, conflicts occurred, and tires were deflated. Several people were arrested by the French police and sent to the Special Second Court for interrogation. In the past two days, some striking rickshaw pullers have been blocking the road and deflating tires. At a little more than 1 pm on the 7th, a detective of the French police arrested Gu Changxing, a 16-year-old boy from Jiangbei Xinghua, on Blue Weiai Road for deflating rickshaw tires. He was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Special Second Court yesterday. At 10 am, Judge Li Changnian interrogated him. Police Attorney Fei Xizhen stated the case, and filed a lawsuit based on Articles 304 and 305 of the Criminal Law for using violence and coercion to obstruct freedom. When the defendant Gu Changxing was interrogated, he confessed that he had let go of one car and was playing around. No one asked me to let it go. Then the plaintiff Yu Baolong (45 years old, Funing native, i.e., the rickshaw puller whose tires were deflated) testified, saying that yesterday when I was pulling a car through there, there were twenty or thirty people, and they were deflating tires. The defendant came up and pulled a few cars to deflate them. I stopped him and he said, "Don't make noise, or I will drag you to the Chinese territory and kill you." So I reported to the patrolman to arrest him, and the rest ran away. At this point, the court ordered the debate to begin. The police attorney based on the plaintiff's testimony, if the court can trust him, should be convicted according to Article 305 of the Criminal Law, otherwise, judge according to Article 304. The official then questioned the defendant whether he had said any threatening words. Gu Changxing denied saying these words and said that he and four children went to play together, and no adults instructed him. He was asked if there were any relatives at home. He replied that his parents had returned to Jiangbei, and only one brother was doing fish business in the 16th pier. The court verified the confession and immediately announced the verdict in court. Gu Changxing was sentenced to 20 days of detention and a two-year suspended sentence for using violence and coercion to obstruct people's exercise of rights. During the appeal period, the defendant was transferred to the detention center, and during the suspended sentence period, he was handed over to relatives for custody.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Red Cross Society Hosted the Press Yesterday; Red Cross Society's Begging for Relief Article <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The General Association of the Chinese Red Cross Society hosted the press at the association's headquarters at 856 Xinzha Road at 4 pm yesterday. More than ten reporters from various newspapers attended. The Secretary-General Cao Yunxiang represented the association and reported that since the relocation of the association, all work has been carried out actively. The second membership drive has begun, and its purpose is to cultivate first-aid talents and store first-aid materials in order to promote the development of the Red Cross Society in our country. This flood has spread and caused great damage. There are many victims waiting to be rescued. The association is currently preparing for relief. Once the approval of the Ministry of the Interior is obtained, it can start. The most urgent method will be used to save the disaster at hand. It was dismissed at about 5 o'clock. It is also said that epidemics have occurred in the disaster areas, and relief work cannot be delayed. The association has first allocated more than 10,000 bottles of anti-epidemic medicine to relieve the emergency. The association's begging for relief article is recorded as follows: It is heard that if people lose below, then the natural change will be shaped above. There is no door for good or bad fortune, only people summon themselves. It is the same today. It has been so since ancient times. Since the Xinwei year, floods and droughts have invaded each other, almost all over the country. The wounds have not recovered, and disasters have come frequently. This summer, such as Xiangfan, Yisha, Qianyi, Tianhan in Hubei, Xiangzi, Yuanfeng, Linyue, Huaichang in Hunan, Yanguo, Lanchen, Xinshang in Henan, Qinyuan in Hebei, Youhe, Yunju in Shandong and other places, incessant rain is a disaster, mountain floods erupt, rivers swell, valleys flow, lakes and seas rush, rivers are replaced, floods are overflowing, thousands of miles are boundless, the framework of heaven is turbulent, and the fields and crops are submerged, houses are in ruins, cities collapse, hills are marked, people move and displaced, livestock die and drown, or drown in the caves, or hang their bones on the peaks, or float and turn, or rest and groan. Other places such as Anhui, Jiangxi, Shandong, and Jiangsu, where the Yangtze and Huai rivers meet and the lakes are connected, are still affected by the continuous rain. How cruel is the way of heaven, and how tragic is the catastrophe for living beings! The association's purpose is to be devoted to fraternity, and its responsibility is to save people. Seeing this hardship, it is difficult to be safe and silent. It is difficult to support a single tree, and it is ashamed to lose the plan of planning. I would like to ask for help from everyone, and I dare to respond to the call of Jiang Bo, not avoiding the criticism of digging a well when thirsty. I will contribute my humble loyalty, express my sincerity, and appeal to all great philanthropists at home and abroad to generously relieve the suffering and widely solicit donations, the more the better, come from the source, overcome the difficulties of the times together, and rush to the rescue. If the spirit of mutual assistance can save the madness, then human affairs will overcome the sky and save the catastrophe, which will not only be the luck of the disaster victims, but also the blessing of the nation's future. This association cannot express enough its fragrant prayers.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Huaqiang Steamship Had No Communication for Seven Days; There Was a Hurricane in the South Seas; The Company Is Very Anxious <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>In the South Seas, there have been hurricanes attacking for days. There have also been many cases of steamships in Shanghai being attacked by the wind and temporarily anchoring to avoid the wind, or having their electric wires broken by the wind, causing false alarms. Unexpectedly, in this hurricane, the Huaqiang Wheel of Huasheng Company in this port has been missing for many days. Now it is being searched for. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Shipping Goods from Vietnam</p>
<p>Huasheng Steamship Company recently purchased a giant steamship named Huaqiang, with a deadweight of 5,292 tons. The shipowner is Norwegian. The ship is assigned to sail to the North and South Seas and various places abroad to transport goods and does not carry passengers. This time, it sailed from Shanghai to Annam Haiphong, loaded with passengers and goods, and then went to Hongji to transport coal, and then to Keelung, Taiwan. Unexpectedly, at this time, the ship suddenly disappeared.</p>
<p>Telegram Telling the Voyage</p>
<p>On July 29, Huasheng Company received a telegram from the captain of the Huaqiang Wheel, reporting that the ship had sailed from Haiphong that day and arrived at Hongji. It had loaded all the goods in Hongji. Due to the lack of 500 tons of fuel coal, it set off for Keelung, Taiwan to load coal. Since this telegram, there has been no communication for seven consecutive days. The company is quite worried and decided to send a telegram to inquire.</p>
<p>Whereabouts Unknown</p>
<p>Until the 5th of this month, the company estimated that the voyage should have arrived in Keelung, Taiwan early. Why is there still no news? It immediately telegraphed Keelung to inquire whether the Huaqiang Wheel had arrived in Taiwan, and received a reply saying that it had not arrived in Keelung and its whereabouts were unknown. The company was very alarmed when it received the reply and immediately sent out calls to inquire. Yesterday afternoon, the company asked the Coast Guard to send a telegram on its behalf to call and inquire about the location of all coastal ports and valleys.</p>
<p>Notice to All Parties</p>
<p>Because the ship has peace insurance of 140,000 yuan, and all the crew members, stokers, sailors, etc. also have maritime accident insurance, the company sent a letter to the China Ship Insurance Federation for verification yesterday afternoon. It is heard that the Huaqiang Wheel and its cargo are worth at least 400,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Since China Airlines changed the Shanghai-Hankou section of the Shanghai-Sichuan line to one round trip per day from August 15, all sectors have found it convenient. Although the section from Chongqing to Chengdu flies on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays of each week, passengers still feel sorry for not getting a seat. In order to facilitate transportation, it is decided to change the Chongqing-Chengdu section to one round trip per day from the 15th of this month. The flight time will still be as before. It is expected that after the implementation of increased flights on this section, the air transport between Shanghai and Sichuan will be further developed.</p>

Regarding the savings part, there are about 500 savings households, with a total deposit of about 800,000 yuan. However, the amount receivable outside the bank is more than 1.5 million yuan, plus the savings guarantee deposit deposited in the Ministry of Finance, which is enough to pay off all savings deposits. The liquidation office decided to first issue 15% of the savings to the savings depositors from tomorrow, and all debt principals under 10 yuan will be paid off in one lump sum.</p>

<p>The International Affairs Research Association held its 41st board meeting at the Bank Club the day before yesterday (the 7th). Directors Liu Zhanen, Guo Bingwen, Cao Yunxiang, Xu Xinliu, and Li Zhaohuan attended. Chairman Chen Zheqing did not attend due to business. Guo Bingwen chaired the meeting. First, Director Tu reported on the English essay competition with a prize. Advertisements will be published in the Shen Bao for three days in mid-October. The meeting has received many letters from various places requesting the charter. Secretary Kuang reported that the inaugural issue of the English quarterly magazine can be published within two weeks, and then the discussion focused on association affairs. Director Guo proposed that in recent years, due to the world's economic depression, important figures from various countries' industries and businesses have come to China to study economics. The scale of the US economic inspection group this year is particularly large. The results of its inspections will benefit its own country's industries, which are not insignificant. Our country is now affected by the economic depression. Exports are decreasing day by day and imports are increasing day by day. It is urgent to investigate the actual situation in various countries in order to remedy it. He proposed to initiate the organization of an overseas economic inspection group. After discussion by the directors, it was resolved in principle to pass it and to have the executive department draft detailed measures and submit them to the next board meeting for discussion. In addition, Xu Xinliu was elected as the director of the political and economic group, Chen Zheqing as the chairman of the Sino-Japanese Committee, and Tang Shishu as the chairman of the Sino-German Committee.

<h3 id="e104">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sends a Telegram to the Ministry of Finance Requesting Telecommunications Insurance Policy Stamps; Two Cents Per Thousand Yuan of Insurance Coverage Is No Different From Adding a Business Tax <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing yesterday, which reads: Nanjing Ministry of Finance Junjian, The Insurance Industry Association of this city believes that the stamp tax law will be implemented soon. According to the tax rate table in Article 16 of the law, a stamp of two cents is required for each thousand yuan of insurance coverage, and any amount exceeding one thousand yuan will also be counted as one thousand yuan. The difference between this and the usual stamp duty based on the actual insurance premium collected is huge. The association has directly submitted a request for relief to Junbu on the 2nd of this month. It has been heard that the association has copied the draft submission and sent a letter requesting that we call for assistance. The tax rate table lists insurance policies in Article 14, and although the contract documents in Article 15, the undertaking documents in Article 16, and the joint venture business documents in Article 18 are stipulated to have a stamp duty of two cents for every one hundred yuan, they are all calculated based on the actual amount received. Even though the share capital in Article 17 and the bonds in Article 20 are both taxed at two cents for every one hundred yuan of face value, stocks and bonds are issued at a maximum of 90% of their face value per hundred yuan. The difference is extremely limited. The insurance amount is only a few thousandths of the premium charged for each thousand yuan of insurance coverage. Two cents of stamp duty is the same as two cents of stamp duty for each ten yuan or less. Two cents will be added for each standard exceeded. Comparing this with each other, the stamp duty in Article 14 is actually ten times heavier than those of Article 15 to Article 20. This insurance policy is no different from a contract document in terms of its business relationship, and there seems to be no reason for heavy taxes. If the current tax rate is followed, it is the same as collecting a business tax in advance for those engaged in the insurance business. The same business should not be solely burdened with extremely heavy burdens. Judging from the situation, the formulation of this tax rate at that time was indeed lacking in carefulness. It is reasonable to report the situation to Junbu Jianhe and grant relief within a possible range, which is a matter of public convenience. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce Kou Yu,</p>

<p>The China Qisheng Society has sent 1,000 bottles of Jisheng Dan and other medicines such as Jishiasha San to Heze County, Shandong Province, where the floods were severe and medical treatment was needed. Mr. Zhou Baipeng brought 3,000 bottles of Jisheng Dan and other medicines to relieve the victims of the Shandong floods. Now, due to the serious epidemic atmosphere in Wuhan, the hospital sent a letter requesting medicine. A total of 1,800 bottles each of Jisheng Dan and dysentery medicine, 2,000 bottles of Shidi Shui, 1,000 packs of Rendan, and 100 bottles of Shishasan were sent. Chairman Xu of the National Government Relief Association also collected relief items and sent 1,700 bottles of Jisheng Dan, 1,200 bottles of dysentery medicine, 200 boxes of Baoan Dan, 2,000 bottles of Shidi Shui, a few bottles of Lingbao Dan, and 100 bottles of Shishasan, all of which were handed over for urgent use. The rest were sent sporadically to various provinces, with varying numbers, totaling about 100,000 bottles. Relief medicines for emergency relief are extremely important. It is heard that the association is making every effort to appeal for disaster relief.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Revitalizing New Industrial Products; Ministry Orders the Use of Chinese Sulfur and Sulfuric Acid; All Factories Should Try Their Best to Match Domestic Products; Order All Transportation Departments to Strictly Manage and Promote Sales <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance issued an order yesterday to the salt and sulfur bureaus of various provinces, the transportation envoys' offices of Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, Gansu, Qinghai, Guangxi, and Shanxi, the Ningxia Trade and Transportation Bureau, the Xinjiang Transportation and Sales Bureau, the Koubei Mongolian Salt Bureau, and the Shaanxi Tax Collection Bureau, saying: Since the Ministry took over the affairs of saltpeter and sulfur, it has made every effort to revitalize domestic saltpeter and sulfur products. For the saltpeter part, there is the Kaifeng Saltpeter Refinery, which purchases hand-made saltpeter and refines fine saltpeter. The potassium nitrate content of this fine saltpeter is more than 99%, which is no less inferior than imported products. It relies on supplying the needs of the whole country, and its effectiveness is gradually increasing. Recently, the affairs of collecting and refining saltpeter in various saltpeter producing areas in the country, such as Xuhai in Ting Su, Caodan in Shandong, 21 counties in northern Anhui, and the entire province of Hebei, have been assigned to the factory for handling, in order to increase raw materials and promote sales. For the sulfur part, the production in Hunan, Hubei, and Henan provinces is the most abundant. They have been repeatedly ordered to improve quality and reduce costs, and to order the provinces to try their best to match them. Recently, an improved sulfur refining test field was established in Xin'an, Henan Province. The latest scientific methods are used to actively improve manufacturing to facilitate sales. Potassium acid has always been supplied by foreign countries, and no domestic manufacturers have manufactured it. The Ministry of Salt Affairs has repeatedly established a Potassium Acid Manufacturing Research Committee to study all matters related to the establishment of potassium acid factories, and has hired domestic industrial experts with rich experience to conduct joint research to promote progress. All of these revitalizations of domestic products are intended to block loopholes and assist industry and commerce, and are also of great benefit to the overall management and increase of tax revenue from saltpeter and sulfur. It is now found that sulfuric acid is also a type of saltpeter and sulfur product, and the number of domestic users is very large. In the past, due to the scarcity of our country's production, most of them were purchased from abroad, and the loss of rights and interests was countless. Recently, domestic acid manufacturing factories, such as Shanghai Kaicheng Acid Manufacturing Company and Tianjin Lizhong Acid Manufacturing Plant, have manufactured sulfuric acid with abundant production. In order to revitalize the national economy, they should be recommended. It is appropriate to order the provinces to immediately comply with this order and transfer it to the factories in the province for use. In the future, when purchasing and transporting sulfuric acid, they must try their best to distribute domestic products. As for how to strictly check the use of sulfuric acid in various industries to emphasize management, and how to effectively promote the sales of domestic sulfuric acid to cultivate tax sources, they should also consider the situation in the province and present it for review and approval. This is the order.</p>
<h3 id="e107">The City's First Batch of Municipal Literacy Schools Ends at the End of the Month; The First Batch of Literacy Schools Will Be Mostly Set Up in Rural Areas; Labor Literacy Schools Must All Be Established Within a Month <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>According to Shanghai News, the municipal government is promoting compulsory literacy education. The first batch of municipal literacy schools will end at the end of this month, and preparations for the second batch of literacy schools will begin immediately. All labor literacy schools must be established uniformly within this month. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>First Batch of Literacy Schools Ends at the End of the Month</p>
<p>There are a total of 220 municipal literacy schools in the first batch. Since school started on July 1, it has been more than a month. The first textbook has been completed at the end of July, and the second textbook is currently being taught. According to the regulations, the time limit is two months and is scheduled to end at the end of this month. The Municipal Literacy Education Committee has sent people to inspect the schools, and the situation is very good. Students who are absent from class for no reason will be punished by the Public Security Bureau, either with fines or hard labor, without any leniency, so there are very few students absent from class.</p>
<p>Second Batch of Literacy Schools Mostly Set Up in Rural Areas</p>
<p>The Municipal Literacy Education Committee believes that July and August are the busy farming season, so the first batch of literacy schools is mostly distributed in urban areas and towns. The second batch of literacy schools will be mostly set up in rural areas because the busy farming season has passed. According to the planned schedule, the second batch of literacy schools will start on September 1 and end at the end of October.</p>
<p>Labor Literacy Schools Must Be Established Within the Time Limit</p>
<p>Regarding the promotion of labor literacy education, the Mountain Literacy Education Committee and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau have jointly issued a notice requiring all factories, fields, companies, and shops to report the names of literate and illiterate workers in accordance with the regulations. All factories, fields, companies, and shops that should set up labor literacy schools must all be opened before the end of this month. Those who do not set up schools will be severely punished.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Epidemic Prevention Work in This City is Tense - No Epidemic has Occurred This Year - Inoculation Work to End Next Month <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Since the beginning of summer this year, the heat waves in this city have surged at one time. The Municipal Health Bureau has worked extremely hard on epidemic prevention work, so no epidemic has occurred. Now that autumn has arrived, it is hoped that one will not occur. According to an interview with a person in charge of the Municipal Health Bureau, the health authorities of the Chinese and Concession areas in this city during the summer...</p>
<p>Epidemic prevention work... the authorities in charge of health were very concerned with epidemic prevention work. The inoculation teams and disinfection teams worked day and night, with the number of people inoculated reaching over 500,000. The hospitals have not reported any genuine cases of cholera or other seasonal epidemics. The hospitals during this summer were just as busy as usual, without any increase. However, the Municipal Health Bureau has not stopped inoculation work and it is expected to conclude by the end of next month.</p>
<p>Regarding the garbage problem, there was previously a dispute that caused garbage to pile up in the Sixteen Pups area, which was very detrimental to hygiene. The Health Bureau has attached great importance to this issue as it is carrying out epidemic prevention work. Therefore, the bureau has urged the contractors to resolve the problem quickly, and it is now proceeding as normal. The bureau also stated that the transportation of garbage has been inconvenient in the past due to the unresolved pier issue. The Municipal Government has allocated 3,000 yuan to build a dedicated garbage pier in the Sixteen Pups area, and construction will begin soon.</p>

<p>At about 7:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, Ruan Kaigi, the head of the New Zha sub-bureau in Zhabei, brought in kidnapper Zhu Xiaolong and suspect Huang Miaosheng, who were brought in by Bao Ziying, the leader of the detective team. Ouyang Liu, a member of the bureau, interrogated Zhu Xiaolong, who confessed that he was 32 years old, from Yancheng, currently residing at No. 34 Fenshui Temple Road in Hongkou, and worked in Tao Fen. The kidnapping of Xiang Yixing, the owner of the foundry on Hongnan Shan Road, was initiated by Zhang Hongzhi, also known as Zhang Erlaotouzi. On February 26th of the old calendar this year, he asked me to prepare a boat. I rented a Yang boat from the Gu boatyard in Luodian for a monthly rent of 10 yuan. It was prepared to hide the victim in the boat after the kidnapping, until June 7th, when the boat was taken back due to unpaid rent. On the afternoon of July 20th, I met Zhang Hongzhi in Hongkou, and he told me that the victim had been kidnapped and placed in a duck shed about a mile north of Dachang, guarded by Xiaogouzi and Genbao, who had two pistols. He told me not to talk too much and that I would naturally get my share when the money was obtained. On June 24th (referring to the old calendar), I went to see the duck shed north of Dachang, but Xiaogouzi and Genbao were no longer in the shed and had moved elsewhere. I saw Huang Miaosheng inside. Huang Miaosheng confessed that he was 26 years old, from Dachang, Baoshan County, residing in a bungalow in Hou Xuejiazhai, Dachang, and lived by raising ducks and farming. I did not know anything about Zhu Xiaolong kidnapping, and I do not admit that there was a victim hidden in my house. After the interrogating officer verified the confession, Zhu Xiaolong was found to have admitted to being an accomplice in the kidnapping of Xiang Yixing, so he was ordered to be sent to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. Huang Miaosheng did not admit to hiding a victim in his house and was released on bail, to be summoned at any time. Yesterday afternoon, Zhu Xiaolong and the confession were sent to the Public Security Bureau for disposal.</p>

<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, the Hua Feng Xing Ji Flour Mill at No. 289 Yaoshui Lane in West Shanghai was unable to resume operations due to the failure of General Manager Lu Shaotang's real estate business and the resulting bankruptcy. All 320 workers were promised by the factory that they would be paid a living allowance of 8 yuan per month until the factory reopened. For several months, everything was peaceful. But yesterday, the factory announced its closure due to a lack of funds to pay the allowance. The workers negotiated with the factory, and the Social Bureau approved the legal layoff of the workers as the factory was unable to resume operations. However, the factory was ordered to temporarily maintain the workers' living allowance in accordance with the law until the matter was resolved.</p>
<h3 id="e116">All Circles Enthusiastically Participate in Yesterday's Eighth-Eighth National Goods Cigarette Festival - Commemorative Meeting Established - Leaders Express Cooperation - Telegrams Sent to Trade Associations in Various Regions to Rise Up in Unison <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The National Cigarette Industry has determined August 8th as the Eighth-Eighth National Goods Cigarette Festival. Yesterday, in adverse weather conditions with wind and rain, they still relied on their spirit of unity and, according to the work outline, carried out their work conscientiously, seriously, and with division of labor. For example, major newspapers produced special issues, slogans were posted all over the city, comedy skits were performed in the air, and cigarette factories and stores were specially decorated. The huge publicity effect of eye-catching posters on public buses not only caused a sensation in one corner of the city. At 3:00 p.m., the association held a commemorative meeting at the City Chamber of Commerce, and the ceremony was particularly grand. At that time, the association's standing committee members Yuan Ludeng, Shen Weiting, Shen Xingde, Lao Jingxiu, Jing Yimeng, Ding Houqing, Bao Gengsheng, Wu Linzhi, Sun Daosheng, Ding Zhenbo, and Shen Xuewen cordially entertained the guests. The meeting place was covered with slogans, and the tables were filled with famous cigarettes such as Sanma, Beautiful, Human Life, Guanghua, and Jiabao. Nanyang also presented a pack of White Gold Dragon cigarettes. The meeting ended with refreshments and a photo session. The details of the meeting and the opinions of the newspapers are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>The Grand Occasion of the Establishment Meeting of the Eighth-Eighth National Goods Cigarette Festival (Photo by Changqi)</p>
<p>List of Delegates Present</p>
<p>Yu Zuoting, Wang Yansong, Du Yuesheng (represented by Yuan Ludeng), Chen Zeqing, Zai Boqi, Ma Yinliang, Mi Jifang, Li Haoran (represented by Shen Jicang), Tang Shichang, Guan Jian, Yao Junyu, Wang Jilu (represented by Chen Dafan), Luo Qinghua, Xi Yushu, Hu Xiyuan, Ren Jinping, Xu Xiaochu, Yan Esheng, Wang Xingyao, Zhao Erchang, Jin Runxiang, Zheng Chengqing, Wu Yun Chu (represented by Fang Zhicheng), Zhou Xuexiang, Wang Zhifang, Sun Choucheng and other industry leaders, and representatives from cigarette factories such as Nanyang, Huacheng, Fuxin, Lixing, Huamei, Hexing, Dadong, Ruilun, Cuizhong, Zhongnan, Jiangzhe, etc., including Shen Yankang, Sun Lishan, Wang Gengbao, Hua Weiqing, Zhang Gaonan, Shui Xiangqing, Wang Qiuquan, Wang Xingtang, Shi Xiqing, Han Xushan, and Xi Zhixiang, totaling more than 100 people.</p>
<p>Opening Remarks by the Presidium</p>
<p>Mr. Yuan Ludeng said that today's August 8th Festival has four wishes: first, those who do not smoke should continue not to smoke, but please pay attention to smokers among their relatives and friends, and they must all smoke domestic cigarettes; second, those who already smoke domestic cigarettes should maintain it permanently; third, those who smoke regardless of domestic or foreign cigarettes are requested to recognize that they must smoke domestic cigarettes; and fourth, those who smoke imported goods are requested to switch to domestic cigarettes. Finally, he hoped that starting from "Chinese people should smoke Chinese cigarettes," the goal of "Chinese people should use Chinese goods" could be achieved. Mr. Shen Weiting reported briefly that the domestic cigarette factory has a history of more than 30 years. In these 30 years, it has competed with foreign tobacco in business, and countless people have followed one another. Until last year, there were still more than 40 Chinese factories, but less than half of them could really maintain their business. This year, since foreign tobacco has been competitively priced, the cigarette business has become even more miserable. There have been frequent cases of shutdowns and reduced work. Because there is an organization of the tobacco leaf printing industry, we maintain a spirit of mutual unity and seek common survival and development. Today, we are honored to have leaders from all walks of life participate, which is not only an honor for the future of the cigarette industry, but also the welfare of the entire domestic goods industry.</p>
<p>Speeches by Leaders of Various Industries</p>
<p>(1) Mr. Wang Yansong, representative of the Industrial and Commercial Revival Association, said that today's August 8th Festival can be called the anniversary of the start of the revival movement of your cigarette industry, just like the Revival Association established by the City Chamber of Commerce, which has the same purpose, but one is based on the position of the industry, and the other is a unified planning of various industries. Revival work is like seeking medical treatment and medication, and it is necessary to first understand the source of the disease, and then prescribe the right medicine to achieve practical results. Now, your colleagues in the industry can unite as one, and will surely achieve the goal of common survival and common prosperity in the future. (2) Mr. Chen Zeqing, representative of the City Chamber of Commerce, said that the Eighth-Eighth Festival set by your industry, with the slogan "Chinese people should smoke Chinese cigarettes," all Chinese people should learn from the people of various countries who love their own domestic cigarettes and not haggle over everything. Then this cigarette industry with more than 30 years of history will not be difficult to go from decline to prosperity. (3) Mr. Ma Yinliang, representative of the press, said that whether domestic cigarettes can achieve development depends on the promotion of society and the degree of cooperative efforts of your industry. (4) Mr. Xi Yushu, representative of the financial community, said that the shape of the characters of the Eighth-Eighth Festival has great significance. The upper "eight" character is the first of the "separate" character, and its meaning probably means that the past situation of the domestic cigarette industry has an image of decentralized strength. The lower "eight" character can be regarded as the tail of the "common" character in the phrase "common survival and common prosperity" in your association's purpose, meaning that from today's August 8th Festival onwards, the industry will combine the previously scattered strength into one, and become common survival and common prosperity.</p>
<p>Expressions of the Media</p>
<p>Yesterday's August 8th National Goods Cigarette Festival, the Xinmin, Shen, Chen, Shishi, and Min newspapers in this city all published editorials, either reviewing the causes of past gains and losses of the industry, or specifying the paths to be followed in the future, with far-sighted and thought-provoking words. The association will record them separately and show them as a class of advocacy of the press. (Xinwenbao) Foreign merchants have strong capital and dance with long sleeves, so they can gain an advantage. In addition, social purchasing power is sluggish, and Chinese cigarette factories have been hit hard. Therefore, today we should plan another strategy for maintenance. Also, from the current situation, we should pay attention to two points: first, Chinese cigarette factories should unite as one to seek production and sales cooperation. In this way, we can reduce unnecessary competition and jointly seek the development of the entire industry. The second is to improve technology and goods. There are many reasons why it is not easy to win competition between domestic and foreign goods, and the technical problem is the most important. If each factory can work together and save the cost of unnecessary competition, it will be possible to focus on fundamental issues and stand on the ground forever. (Haoran) (Shenbao) There are three ways for the cigarette industry to save itself in the future. First, to enrich the internal, such as improving the quality of tobacco, improving technology, maintaining integrity, and perfecting the organization. Second, to do solid publicity. Third, to seek production and sales cooperation, so as to avoid the unnecessary waste of competition among the industry. (Du) (Chenbao) The operators of the domestic cigarette industry should strive to promote the realization of production and sales cooperation in the future. Under the cooperation of production and sales, the following effects can be obtained: 1. To avoid the unnecessary losses of competition among the industry. 2. Funds and talents can be concentrated, seeking the progress of technology, and the smoothness of the industry's finances is easy. 3. For the quantity of production, we can have a comprehensive calculation and can have a concentrated force to control the entire market. (Leng) (Shishi Xinbao) If we can follow the principle of self-sufficiency and promote domestic cigarettes, we can also fill a little leak in foreign trade. However, cigarettes are just one of many domestic goods. Today, the industry colleagues can commemorate domestic cigarettes with the August 8th Festival at all costs, which is another posture for the domestic goods movement. For the sake of the entire national industry, we especially hope that other domestic goods industries can follow up and compete directly with the cigarette industry, which is more positive. (Minbao) For the sake of self-preservation of the domestic cigarette industry, the only way out is to abandon self-competition and unite as one. Domestic colleagues have those who unite production and sales cooperation, and the cigarette industry can follow suit. Each factory can use the number of production to allocate sales in various places, eliminating unnecessary competition in the industry. In this way, promotion expenses can be saved, and procedures can be reduced. The savings can be used to improve quality or reduce prices to increase the credibility of the product and suit the purchasing power of consumers. If this is true, the domestic cigarette industry will be enough to talk about survival and resist foreign goods.</p>
<p>Telegrams Sent to Various Regions by the Conference</p>
<p>To the Public Chamber of Commerce of the Cigarette Industry in various places, the recent situation is that our domestic cigarette industry has been greatly affected by the adverse environment, forming a downward trend. Therefore, our colleagues in the association do not want to think about themselves, and are eager to save it. The situation has been reported to the record. Now, in order to expand publicity, hold a long-term perspective, and set August 8th (that is, August 8th) as the National Goods Cigarette Festival, we have specially invited representatives from all walks of life to hold a grand ceremony today. Later, it will be used as an example forever, and we will hold a commemorative meeting on this day every year, shouting loudly, arousing people's deep thoughts, promoting the trend of the establishment, and hoping to achieve the work of lying down and tasting courage. In addition to reporting according to the case, please call on your association to follow the training of everyone and to think about the common feelings of being in the same boat, rise up in unison, support each other, and commemorate it together on this day every year, so that the domestic cigarette business can flourish and gradually reach the bright and splendid field. We hope and pray, the All-China National Goods Cigarette Maintenance Association.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Corpse of a Woman Found in the Huangpu River: The Deceased's Family Background and Life Experiences are Pitiable; The Court is Conducting a Very Thorough Investigation of the Case <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>On the 3rd of this month, when the steamship "Shengjing" of the Daegu Company at Pier 3 of the French Concession was weighing anchor, its propeller churned up the corpse of a woman named Zhang Jinlin, aged 48. The water police brought the body to the Fushe Pier Rescue Bureau, and reported it to the local court, which sent personnel to examine it. The corpse was identified by Zhang Zhou, a relative of the deceased, who arranged for a coffin and burial. Chief Inspector Zhong Shangbin secretly instructed police chiefs Zhang Shuping and Chen Xihui to bring Hao Zhongyang, who was willing to be a witness, and detectives from the water police station to arrest Zhu Fuqing (also known as Chu Fuqing), Qiao Liantang, and Qiao Qi.</p>
<p>These three men and women were immediately brought to the court, where Prosecutor Xie Lian interrogated and detained them for further investigation. The details of this case have been reported in this newspaper. Since the occurrence of this tragedy, the public has been paying close attention. Further investigation has revealed the following: The deceased, Zhang Jinlin, was a local. Her father, who is deceased, served as a comprador for the Yi Feng and Jardine Matheson companies for many years and was quite wealthy. When the deceased married at the age of twenty, she received a rich dowry. Unfortunately, she did not have any children. When she was twenty-nine, her husband passed away from illness. Because her husband's family had few uncles and no children,</p>
<p>her future seemed bleak. Someone arranged for her to remarry to a Mr. Meng, who ran a silk store on Wuma Road. They lived together in a rented house and got along very well. Because they did not have children, they adopted a girl (who is now ten years old and being raised in the Meng family in Shandong). In 1933, the silk store failed, and Mr. Meng had no intention of continuing the business. He sold the store and took Zhang Jinlin and the girl back to his hometown in Shandong. However, Mr. Meng was fond of women. Although he had a wife in his hometown, he also took a 17-year-old girl from Beijing as a concubine, whom he doted on. He treated the deceased like a slave.</p>
<p>Her life was filled with misery. In April of this year (lunar calendar), Mr. Meng ordered the deceased to accompany a relative surnamed Mou to initiate a preaching mission along the Longhai Railway. The deceased took the opportunity to come to Shanghai by boat. She only carried two sets of short shirts and pants, and a rattan suitcase containing two and a half Shandong steamed buns and half a dried lobster. She also carried a gold and diamond ring, and a blue gem-studded ring, a gold watch, and some cash. That was all she had. She had kept her diamond ring and other items closely guarded in Shandong, rarely taking them out. It is said that because she did not have enough travel money, she pawned a jade bracelet for thirteen yuan in the Longhai area, and used two and a half yuan to purchase the aforementioned buns.</p>
<p>She bought a rattan suitcase for storing clothing. The steamed buns and lobster were bought in Shandong to eat along the way. By the time she arrived in Shanghai, the steamed buns were as hard as iron and impossible to swallow. After arriving in Shanghai, the deceased went to the home of her aunt Zhang Zhou at No. 2 Hengde Lane, east of the Xiaoshijie in the city (the deceased was the daughter of Zhang Zhou's elder sister), and stayed there temporarily. The deceased remembered that Chu Fuqing, a Shaoxing native who ran a wooden comb shop in Shanghai, had borrowed 2,000 yuan from her in the past, and a promissory note was made at the time (the promissory note is kept in the Meng family in Shandong). Over the years, neither the principal nor the interest had been paid. Therefore, the deceased repeatedly went to Chu Fuqing</p>
<p>to demand repayment of the principal and interest. Reportedly, he had paid two hundred and sixty yuan several times. The deceased considered it interest, while Chu considered it repayment of the principal. Chu Fuqing also instructed the deceased to publish a statement in the newspaper before he would return the principal in full. Chu Fuqing asked a fortune teller to write a draft for the newspaper announcement, which was published in the Xin Kai Bao’s classifieds on June 6th under the title "Lost Passbook Statement of Cancellation," which stated: (Hereby announcing the loss of a passbook for 2,000 yuan deposited at the Chuyuanxing Wooden Comb Shop west of the Great Hall of the City God Temple in the city. A loss report has been filed with the shop, and the entire amount will be withdrawn. If the passbook is found in the future,</p>
<p>it should be considered invalid. Zhang Lin, signed.) The deceased asked someone to read the draft of the announcement and realized she had been deceived. She then hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit to recover the loan, signing a power of attorney and specifying a legal fee of 440 yuan. While this was in progress, the tragedy suddenly occurred. On the day of the incident, the deceased had dinner at her aunt Zhang Zhou's house. Around 9 PM, the deceased intended to go to the roof of the Xiaoshijie to cool off, but Zhang Zhou, thinking it was cool enough at home, tried to stop her. The deceased replied that she would be back in a moment and left. Unexpectedly, it would be a permanent farewell. That night,</p>
<p>the deceased did not return, but Zhang Zhou did not think much of it. (Zhang Zhou's younger brother, who is the deceased's uncle, lives in the concession and is fairly well-off. The deceased usually stayed at her aunt's house or her uncle's house. However, the deceased's uncle disapproved of her behavior, believing that remarrying after her husband's death was a disgrace to the family. Therefore, although the deceased visited her uncle's house, she did not exchange a word with him.) It was not until the third day that she saw reports in the local newspapers about a female corpse found in the Huangpu River. The description of the deceased's clothing was similar to her niece's. She rushed to the Rescue Bureau to identify the body and confirmed that it was her missing niece. The court is now handling this case with great care and conducting a thorough investigation to ensure that no one is wrongly accused or goes unpunished.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Republican Motor Company: Child Killed by Car; Chauffeur Prosecuted by the Police <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Yu Yuting, a five-year-old son of Mrs. Yu Dong, a Ningbo native residing at 107 Ou Jia Road, was crossing the road from south to north on the aforementioned road at 3:50 PM the day before yesterday when Xue Yingsheng, the driver of car number 18287 of the Republican Motor Company at 405 Gedeng Road, sped from the east. He could not brake in time and hit the child, knocking him to the ground. The child was severely injured. Upon seeing the accident, Xue immediately took the child to Tongren Hospital in the same car. Due to a refusal to admit the child, he was then transferred to Guangren Hospital. Medical treatment proved ineffective and the child died at 12 o’clock that night. The hospital reported the matter to the Jiaxing Road Police Station, which dispatched detective Feikelun to investigate. The chauffeur was arrested and detained at the police station, and the child's body was taken to the Feilun Road mortuary. Yesterday morning, the police station sent Xue Yingsheng to the First Special District Court to file a public prosecution. As the examination of the body and other matters are still pending, a postponement of the case was approved. At around 10 o'clock, Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the prosecutor's office of the aforementioned court, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi, arrived at the mortuary to examine the body. First, the western police chief reported the previous situation. Then, Zhang Rongchang and others claimed that they had no family relationship with the deceased. They said that at the time of the accident, they witnessed the car traveling very fast and not honking its horn. After hitting the child, the car dragged him for the length of five storefronts before stopping. At the time, the child was running across the road very fast. When questioned, Xue Yingsheng stated that he was from Nanjing, 28 years old, and lived at 7 Lane 365 Manzhou Road, Zhabei. He had been driving a car for eight years. That day, he was driving at a speed of twenty yards. When he saw the child, he braked and swerved to the north, but it was too late and he hit him. As for not honking the horn, it was because he was driving on a straight road, etc. Prosecutor Guo obtained the statement and determined that the deceased boy, Yu Yuting, had indeed died from injuries sustained after being struck by car number 18287. Since the chauffeur Xue Yingsheng has been publicly prosecuted by the police station, he should await the court's review. The body was handed over to the child’s mother, Mrs. Yu Dong, after she signed a guarantee to take it back for coffin preparation and burial.</p>

<p>The mirror surface on glass is often plated with silver powder, and other substitutes have not yet been invented. Now, Mr. Lin Zeren, a graduate of Soochow University and former technician at the Sichuan Wanxian Tung Oil Inspection Bureau, who has been engaged in chemical research for many years, has painstakingly invented a copper plating method for glass. The color of the mirror surface is brilliant and captivating, like gold. Its reflectivity is stronger than that of silver plating, and its cost is extremely low. In addition to being used for mirrors, this method is most suitable for thermos bottle liners. Most thermos bottles on the market are plated with silver powder. If copper is plated instead, its heat retention ability will be higher than that of silver, and its beautiful color will be very attractive, especially attracting customers' attention. Mr. Lin applied to the Ministry of Industry for a patent for this method, which was approved yesterday. It was passed by the Industrial Technology Review Committee and granted a five-year patent. Those who wish to cooperate with Mr. Lin can contact him at No. 54 Nanjing Road.</p>

<p>Wu Xixiang, Wu Xishu, Wu Xixun, and Wu Xixiu, four brothers currently residing at 22 Puqing Lane, Malan Road, French Concession, and sons of the late Wu Fuqing, the former chief accountant of the Shanghai HSBC Bank from Anhui, previously hired a lawyer and filed a lawsuit in the Criminal Division of the Special Court, accusing their cousin Wu Hengsun, son of the late Wu Youling, the compradore of the Beijing HSBC Bank, residing at 4 Lane 159, Haig Road, of embezzling shared family property and profits from partnership business. The court accepted the lawsuit and held two hearings to summon the defendant. The defendant hired lawyer Chen Yanrui to defend him and filed a counterclaim for false accusation. The court adjourned the hearing and ordered the plaintiffs to invite witnesses to the court for further questioning. Details have been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday morning, the case was scheduled for a continued hearing. Only Wu Xishao and Wu Xixun, two of the plaintiffs, arrived at the court. The defendant, Wu Hengsun, also arrived with his defense lawyer to await the hearing. At 11:30 AM, Judge Qiu Huanhui presided over the hearing in Criminal Division 2. First, Peng Yuanxun, the attorney representing the plaintiffs, stated that last time he obeyed instructions to bring witness Deng Junxiang to the court for questioning, but now Deng is ill and has gone abroad for treatment, so he was unable to attend today. The judge then questioned Wu Xishao and Wu Xixun about their ages. (Q) Why are the other two plaintiffs, Wu Xixiang and Wu Xixiu, not here today? (A) One has business to attend to, and the other is suffering from a foot ailment, so they did not come. The judge then said that since the defendant has filed a counterclaim, the plaintiffs should all be present, otherwise arrest warrants will be issued. He then questioned Wu Xishao and Wu Xixun on what evidence they had to accuse the defendant of embezzlement. Wu Xixun replied that there were two letters and a statement from a witness already submitted in the case, and that the amount of embezzlement was based on a large portion of the defendant's property and what his late father had said. As for why they had not raised the matter earlier, it was because they were still receiving money at that time. The judge said that these two letters were insufficient to prove embezzlement and asked what they had to say in response to the defendant's counterclaim. (A) We are speaking based on the facts. The judge then asked Wu Xishao if his opinion was the same as Wu Xixun's. (A) The same. The judge then questioned the defendant Wu Hengsun whether you divided the family property. (A) Our ancestors came from Hongyang to escape the disaster. Everyone is self-sufficient. (Q) Was your father's job introduced by the plaintiff's father? (A) No, my father was the only operator of the HSBC Bank compradore, and has nothing to do with the plaintiffs. The judge then gave the letters presented by the plaintiffs to the defendant to read, and the defendant said that the letters were not written by my father. Since there is no seal or signature, how can they be used as evidence? Besides, I know my father's handwriting. (Q) What is the meaning of your counterclaim? (A) They are completely falsely accusing me, so I am filing a counterclaim and requesting a lawful investigation. At this point, the court adjourned the hearing and rescheduled it to the 15th, instructing the plaintiffs to all be present at the next hearing, or arrest warrants would be issued without leniency, and ordered both parties to submit any evidence as soon as possible. After the instructions were given, the court adjourned.</p>

Recently, in order to take into account the economic situation of the common people, the funeral home has specially set up a cooperative mortuary, with particularly low prices, only 10 yuan. Other items are also reduced in price. In short, the funeral home aims to serve the community, so it does not seek to profit, but only seeks to provide affordable services for the common people, truly breaking a new era in funeral homes.</p>
<p>New Invention for Water Bottles: Recently, when elementary and middle school students have calligraphy lessons, adding water often causes it to overflow and flood the table, which is very unhygienic and a pity. A scientist from Zhejiang, Chen Cuilong, has invented a new type of water bottle that is very convenient for class monitors to add water, and the design is beautiful and the manufacturing is excellent. It is made entirely of domestic materials and has been approved by the Municipal Education Bureau for sale in elementary and middle schools in the city, and a special sales license has been granted. It is reported that the price is also very affordable, only 1 jiao per piece and 4 yuan per dozen. Now, at the beginning of sales, there is a special discount of 10% off the original price per dozen. The sole distributor is Shunda Company at 125 Lanweiluo Road, Tangjiawan, West Gate.</p>
<p>Elephant Brand Soda Pop Sales are Booming: The Russian-owned Yanggao Soda Pop Factory has been established in Shanghai for more than ten years and specializes in producing Elephant Brand soda pop of various flavors. The ingredients are clean and the taste is delicious. The price per dozen is the same as ordinary soda pop, but the capacity is more than twice that of ordinary soda pop, so it is used for celebrations and group banquets. There are more than ten types. For every fruit name, there is a soda pop product. The factory has now commissioned He Jingji as the sole agent to popularize the product among Chinese users. For local residents who order more than four dozen, the factory will deliver it by car without charging for delivery. The telephone number is 76042.</p>
<p>Characteristics of Domestic White Pagoda Brand Butter: The White Pagoda Brand Butter issued by the Daya Butter Company is indeed a pure domestic product. It has been tested and certified by various health organizations at home and abroad to be of pure quality and rich in nutrition, and can resist imported products. Therefore, since its promotion, its business has been quite developed.</p>

<p>— (Xie Zhongwen)</p>
<p>Ordinary people are despised, while special people are admired. This is because there are too many ordinary people and ordinary things in the world, and too few special people and special things.</p>
<p>When ordinary people remain poor, it is ordinary; when officials become rich, it is special. Wearing cloth clothes and eating coarse rice is ordinary; wearing silk and satin and eating delicacies is special.</p>
<p>However, without the ordinary, the special would not stand out. The special originates from the ordinary. Without ordinary people, where would officials come from? Without people wearing cloth clothes and eating coarse rice to work, where would silk and satin and delicacies come from? It can be seen that the ordinary should not be despised, and the value of the special should sometimes be lowered.</p>
<p>It is precisely because there are so many ordinary people that they constitute the true members of society. It is precisely because there are so many ordinary things that they are the main part of social life. The ordinary should originally be valued!</p>
<p>The ordinary is the master, the special is the vassal.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Disaster Relief <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Zheng</p>
<p>It is truly unfortunate to be Chinese. One year of man-made disasters, one year of natural disasters. Floods have just passed, and drought follows. The severe drought has just been avoided, but the great flood has arrived again. This year, in the early summer, none of us expected that there would be another drought, but who knew that after not many days of continuous rain, it showed signs of a great flood. Mountain floods broke out, dikes collapsed, and many places became swamps. People and livestock were adrift, and houses were destroyed. Tens of millions of disaster victims were homeless. The cries for help are unbearable to hear.</p>
<p>Now, several enthusiastic philanthropists have recently gone to Beijing to participate in disaster relief meetings to discuss solutions. At the same time, the government has also allocated huge sums of money from the Ministry of Finance for distribution and relief. Although these are far from enough for the tens of millions of disaster victims, they can at least temporarily avoid starvation. For those disaster victims, it is no less than drinking a drop of nectar.</p>
<p>But Shanghai is paradise, and the people who live in Shanghai are always so happy. Floods have nothing to do with them, and drought has nothing to do with them. In short, no natural or man-made disasters will befall them, so they will never think of the suffering of the people in hell. But I always hope that they will unfold these pictures of misery and take a look. If everyone still has a conscience, then they should also save some of their enjoyment money to help the countless homeless, unclothed, and hungry refugees, so as not to let them become wailing wild geese and starving corpses by the roadside!</p>
<p>However, I also have some humble opinions on disaster relief methods that I would like to contribute to the authorities responsible for disaster relief: that is, first of all, the shortcomings of past imperfect management should be eliminated. On the one hand, it is necessary to inspect the situation in the disaster area and distribute relief, and on the other hand, it is necessary to strictly prevent anyone from engaging in corruption. How much is raised should be distributed, and there should be no waste of a single penny except for necessary expenses. This is the only way to make people with money willing to enthusiastically contribute, and those disaster victims will also receive practical benefits.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Water <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>Water, in this world, is everywhere except in the endless deserts. It seems to be the most unremarkable thing, so most people seem to think of water as a very ordinary thing. But water is really the thing that has the greatest relationship to our lives.</p>
<p>Readers, do you still remember? Last summer, in several provinces in the southeast, not a drop of rain fell. The farmland cracked, and in some places the seedlings withered from the drought, and there was no harvest. During that period, in the countryside of the drought area, the farmers took the last spoonful of water from every pond and lake, treaded it with waterwheels or sucked it with spray pumps, and irrigated it into the farmland, trying to maintain the life of the seedlings on which the lives of the whole family depended. Even the flowing water was gradually sucked away by the farmers day by day, and the water level gradually dropped until light boats would kiss the bottom of the river. Just think, at that time, how valuable was "water"? "Water" was, for the farmers, not just indirectly for the farmers, almost an invaluable treasure beyond life.</p>
<p>However, "water" is not necessarily valuable to humans. Sometimes it is considered a great harm to humans. Not to mention past historical events, just look at the recent great wind and rain that hit Kyushu, Japan, and the flooding of our Yangtze River basin, and the other face of "water" should be deeply recognized by the general public.</p>
<p>That's right, "water" is an invaluable treasure beyond human life, but sometimes it is cursed by people. What's the reason for this? Well, "water" is indeed a very ordinary thing, but in reality, it also cannot escape the economic law of "demand" and "supply."</p>

<p>— Feng Moni</p>
<p>"Ah! A hungry ghost."</p>
<p>"How scary, like a skeleton with skin stretched over it."</p>
<p>"Hey! How pitiful."</p>
<p>A group of people were talking. A man was lying on a reed mat on the sidewalk, almost lifeless. His hands and feet were like thin bamboo poles, and his skin had turned gray-white. His eye sockets were sunken, his eyelids were closed, and white foam was flowing from the corner of his mouth. His withered hands were still twitching. Everyone who saw this person felt sorry for him, because he had nothing to eat and was about to starve to death.</p>
<p>"Please do a good deed! He's starving to death!" A woman sitting on the reed mat was pleading with the many people in the crowd.</p>
<p>There were many people in the crowd, but they only expressed sympathy and were unwilling to help, just watching a person who was about to starve to death.</p>
<p>Over there was the Qingpingyuan Restaurant, packed with diners. The kitchen was exceptionally busy, and the pots were constantly clanging. Steaming hot dishes were sent to each diner. Even while eating, they still felt bored. A prostitute with a snake-like body came over, and after eating, she giggled and laughed, supporting the prostitute as she got into a car. They didn't know that on the sidewalk across the street, a person was lying on a reed mat, about to die.</p>
<p>The withered human form gradually stopped twitching and finally died. He was a hungry ghost.</p>
<p>"Hey! He's dead! Please do a good deed!" A woman sitting on the reed mat looked at the man's corpse beside her and pleaded with the many people in the crowd.</p>
<p>"Ah! Truly a hungry ghost."</p>
<p>"How scary, look: like a skeleton with skin stretched over it."</p>
<p>"Ah! Ultimately pitiful."</p>
<p>There were many people in the crowd, but they only expressed sympathy and were unwilling to help, and they watched this person breathe his last breath.</p>
<p>Over there, the Qingpingyuan Restaurant was still so lively, packed with diners, but they didn't know that there was such a hungry ghost on the sidewalk across the street who had died from lack of food!</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess De Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>One night, it was originally my turn to be on duty. Although Elder Lady's worries had been removed, so I no longer had to worry. But on one hand, sitting on the floor made it fundamentally difficult to fall asleep; on the other hand, my heart was occupied with tomorrow's trip to the lake, making it even harder to close my eyes. So I forced myself to vaguely hold out until early the third morning. Early morning here refers to an unambiguous time, around three or four o'clock. The Empress Dowager and everyone else all got up. By the time everyone was neatly packed and swarming onto the Empress Dowager's imperial boat, slowly floating on Kunming Lake, there was still a while before the sun rose! Today, the Empress Dowager's throne was comparatively high and placed in the center of the bow. Behind it, there were many small low stools arranged for us ladies-in-waiting to sit. Our boat was still being punted with bamboo poles, slowly drifting towards the north of Kunming Lake without leaning to either side. The lotus flowers were grown most densely there, and the lotus leaves looked like a green carpet spread on the water. Then, the Empress Dowager said very gently:</p>
<p>"Stop the boat! Everyone be quiet, watch, and listen!"</p>
<p>The scene at this time could be said to have a very mysterious meaning. In the east, although part of the sky was pleasantly dyed with a long streak of color, the sun's head was still hiding below, not yet peeking out. The gray-brown night was gradually moving westward, handing over the position it occupied bit by bit. A few wisps of black smoke curled in mid-air, like the sash of the god of night. Many kingfishers were flying on both sides of us, but not singing, seemingly quietly enjoying the celestial music of the early morning. (385)</p>

<p>As soon as he walked into the door, Yueying immediately stood up, her body pressed tightly against the bed, lowering her head. Jia Duocai turned around and saw Huanhua sitting here, and then he smiled: I was wondering how the door was opened, so you were here. Huanhua stood up and smiled: I saw that Mr. Buyer was not at home, so I came to accompany the new Mrs. on purpose, isn't that good? Now that you are back, then naturally I am not needed. As she spoke, she got up and walked outside. Jia Duocai simply did not want him to come and stand in the room, saying goodbye, without seeing him off. Yang Huanhua had investigated Yueying's situation and had a clear understanding of eight or nine tenths, so he walked towards the backyard. Just as he turned the corner, he saw Wang Beihai, who was tutoring with Cheng Zhiqian, standing blankly to the side, smiling and bowing to greet him. Yang Huanhua, drifting in Xi'an, only had to smile and bow to people. How could anyone be so polite to him? Now, Wang Beihai smiled at him and bowed, and he suddenly froze, not knowing what to say. Hokkaido: Miss Yang, didn't you come from the house of the person named Jia? Huanhua's eyes rolled, and he understood early on in his heart, smiling: He has already become someone else's concubine. You still miss him. Beihai forced a smile: No, but, I think you always talked to him about something. Huanhua said: We talked. That Mr. Jia is in the house, I only said a few ordinary words to him. Hokkaido: I think he must be very sad in his heart? Huanhua smiled: What is there to be sad about being a new bride? Beihai said a sentence, and he was hit back with a sentence, so there was nothing more to say. Because he stood against the wall, he pondered for a while. (285)</p>

<h3 id="e142">Memoirs of an Open-Air Cinema <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Shanghai Dispatch</p>
<p>It's that time of year again. The Racecourse Cinema, the Garden Cinema, and the Cangzhou Hotel Garden Cinema are appearing one after another, embellishing this metropolis for the summer season. Here, we analyze one thing: these three open-air cinemas can be divided into two categories. The first category is the Garden Cinema, which is open as usual this year because it has appeared in previous summers. The second category is the other two; presumably, tourists who like to go to new places have a special impression of them from 1935.</p>
<p>This brings up a small question: what was the distribution of open-air cinemas like in earlier years? If we bring it up, perhaps it will suddenly remind today's night owls of the old days? So, the Shanghai Dispatch opened the parchment book and wrote its answer with a quill pen—</p>
<p>1924 was the year that Shanghai began to have open-air cinemas. "Summer Cinema," on Bazhi Road, was the pioneer of this novelty. In the same year, the St. George Open-Air Cinema closed, in the garden of the St. George Hotel at the end of Jing'an Temple Road. At that time, the starting point of the only public bus route in the Public Concession, operated by Mr. Dong Hansheng, was at the entrance of St. George. Those who pay attention to traffic conditions can still recall it. The backstage boss of the St. George Open-Air Cinema was the then-famous Aipu Factory Cinema, which had strong strength and carefully selected films. The Summer Cinema could not withstand its pressure and disappeared in the second year. However, now that the St. George Hotel has changed hands and the Aipu Factory has long been outdated and eliminated, past events only make people recall it in vain.</p>
<p>The market is always competitive. In the summer of 1925, St. George reappeared with the triumphant posture of defeating the Summer Cinema, and the Dahua Open-Air Cinema also brought the backstage boss of the Shanghai Grand Theatre to become its strong rival. This new open-air silver palace was located in the Italian Garden inside the Dahua Hotel on Gordon Road; the environment was almost exactly the same as the St. George Garden. The place where the Dahua Hotel was located was originally McBain Garden, which was famous in Shanghai for its magnificence. It was bought by someone in 1924 and turned into a hotel, named Dahua. In the autumn of 1931, the Dahua Hotel was sold and demolished, waiting for a price to be negotiated, but no one has asked about it until now. The land has been opened up by the Municipal Council in time to create Dahua and McBain Roads, forming a cross shape, which has become famous. From the opening to the demolition of the Dahua Hotel, the Dahua Open-Air Cinema opened on time every summer for the audience.</p>
<p>The Garden Cinema opened on a large lawn of the Zhafei Road Ball Club, which is the only open-air cinema in the French Concession, and it is also open this year to welcome people in. It started in 1932, but the open-air silver palace on the Ball Club lawn did not originate in 1932: in the summer of 1926, this lawn was used by the Verdun Open-Air Cinema. Tracing the roots, this place of the Ball Club was originally the German Garden, which was confiscated by the French during the European War and turned into a park, named Verdun. It was not until 1926 that it became the new site of the French Ball Club. Some people call it the French Business New Ball Club, and that's why. The cinema in 1926 was called Verdun, and that's why.</p>
<p>Understanding the difficulties and prosperity of the past, knowing the value of the present; the Shanghai Dispatch has thus closed its parchment book.</p>

<p>The Scout Troop of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce (the 50th Troop of the Chinese Scout) is the first of the social Scout troops in the country. It was established in the 16th year of the Republic of China. Its past achievements in serving the public have long been praised by the society. This is due to its good training and the efforts of the organizers. This summer's month-long camping at Houjiazhai in Jiangwan is one of its training programs. In order to make the society pay attention to youth training, the troop specially opened up for visit and reception of social celebrities who lead youth and leaders of the Scout community in this city, who all praised the success of the social Scout cause and praised it endlessly. It is heard that Mayor Wu of Shanghai City was very pleased after reading the report of Section Chief Li Dachao's visit, and specially ordered someone to donate more than ten kinds of books such as Scout to the troop's camp to show encouragement. Also, the day before yesterday (7th), Mr. Ma Teng, the leader and vice president of the Western Scout in this city, and Mr. Gordon, the acting chairman of the association, visited on behalf of all the Western Scouts.

<h3 id="e148">Implementation Plan for Compulsory Education (Part 1) (Lei Zhen's Speech on the Central Radio Station) <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>What I am reporting today is the compulsory education that is being implemented. The meaning of compulsory education is that the state uses laws to stipulate that all school-age children (referring to children from six to twelve years old) in the country must receive the minimum education. From the state's point of view, running compulsory education is an obligation that should be fulfilled to the people. The people enjoy this kind of education as a right. The state provides this kind of education to improve healthy people and improve the qualifications of citizens, so it contains the meaning of compulsion. Most civilized countries in Europe and the United States have laws to punish people who do not comply.</p>
<p>My country's people are ignorant and urgently need to implement compulsory education, which has long been noticed by the general public. However, due to the lack of political track and the extreme economic difficulties, those who care about education cannot start. Sun Yat-sen also said, "...All young men and women in autonomous regions have the right to education. The tuition fees, books, and the clothing and food of the students should be provided by the public." He also said, "...Socialist scholars advocate equality of education. All people in the society, regardless of their poverty, can enter public schools. Not only do they not charge tuition fees, but the expenses of clothing, shoes, and books are also borne by the public, so that the people can use their intelligence and talents to learn all subjects..." It can be seen that the need for compulsory education in our country has long been noticed by those who are aware of it. However, in today's domestic social situation, the people are poor and the resources are exhausted. The right to education is only exclusively occupied by a small number of people. The vast majority of impoverished children have their right to education deprived by economic oppression. Therefore, the vast majority of the people are illiterate and have no knowledge. They live in a romantic, decadent, lazy, and dirty life. Not only do they not know how to pull themselves out, but they regard it as natural. How can we talk to such people about exercising civil rights? How can we talk about jointly shouldering the responsibility of saving the country and the nation?</p>
<p>Today, China is facing a series of disasters caused by both natural disasters and human activities. Foreign neighbors are pressing closer day by day, and the national situation is in extreme danger. At this extraordinary time, saving the country and seeking survival is the responsibility of the entire nation, and it is also a matter of life and death for our entire nation. In order to meet our own needs for survival and to cope with the adverse international environment, we can only awaken ourselves and find our own way to survival and move forward. The important condition for survival is to cultivate healthy citizens, so that the entire nation has the general knowledge suitable for survival and increase their necessary living abilities. To achieve this goal, we should all work hard to carry out the road to eliminate illiteracy, and use the power of education to cultivate the Chinese nation, which is struggling in suffering and eking out a living, so that it can change from unconscious to conscious, from the old and sick man, the nation despised by the world, to a brand-new Chinese nation. This is our due effort and also a wonderful medicine for resurrection.</p>
<p>This time, the government has made the greatest determination to plan and promote compulsory education with all its strength. It is the government's due obligation, but the people's wisdom has not been developed and the funds are limited. We must also work together with the people of the whole country, and each person should do his best to help, so that it can proceed smoothly "step by step according to the regulations" and achieve the final goal.</p>
<p>Assuming that the total population of China is 400 million, with one school-age child in every ten people, there should be 40 million school-age children in the country. According to the statistics of elementary education in the 20th year, the number of elementary school children in the country is more than 11.6 million, and the number of school-age children who are out of school is about 30 million. The number of children in school only accounts for 23% of the school-age children. It can be seen the importance of implementing compulsory education, especially in this time of internal and external troubles. The general public cannot receive the minimum national education, so no matter what is said about political construction or material construction, it is all in vain.</p>
<p>Our Kuomintang deeply understands this point, so at the fifth plenary session of the fourth Central Executive Committee, it was resolved to implement compulsory education and treat both the symptoms and the root causes. The Ministry of Education has followed the promulgation of the General Outline of Measures for the First Phase of Compulsory Education and the General Outline of Measures for the Short-Term Compulsory Education, ordering the education authorities of all provinces and cities to comply with the implementation. This year, it has formulated the Provisional General Outline of Measures for the Implementation of Compulsory Education and the General Outline of Measures for the Distribution of Central Compulsory Education Funds in the 24th year of the Republic of China, and issued them to the education authorities of all provinces and cities for compliance and ordered them to prepare detailed plans to report to the Ministry for reference. Now I will report a summary of the provisional measures for the implementation of compulsory education and funding, and I hope that all compatriots in the country will help to carry out the project.</p>
<p>I. The Purpose of Compulsory Education</p>
<p>Compulsory education should follow the educational purpose of the Republic of China and its implementation guidelines, meet the needs of the actual life of the people, pay attention to the development of national consciousness and national concepts, so that all school-age children in the country (referring to children aged six to twelve) gradually receive one-year, two-year, or four-year compulsory education within a ten-year period.</p>
<p>II. Measures for Compulsory Enrollment and Postponement and Exemption from School</p>
<p>In places where ordinary elementary schools and short-term elementary schools are enough to accommodate local school-age children, all healthy school-age children must enter ordinary elementary schools or short-term elementary schools.</p>
<p>As for school-age children who have diseases or other reasons that temporarily prevent them from attending school, their parents or guardians may request a postponement of school with a certificate. If they have chronic diseases that make them unable to receive education, their parents or guardians may request an exemption from school with a certificate.</p>
<p>For children who should enroll but do not enroll, their parents or guardians should be given a written warning for a certain period of time, requiring them to enroll. Otherwise, their names will be posted for public display. If they still do not comply, the county or city education administrative agency may request the county government to impose a fine of one to five yuan and still require them to enroll within a time limit. The aforementioned fines will still be used for the purpose of compulsory education.</p>
<p>III. Procedures for Implementing Compulsory Education</p>
<p>In the 24th year of the Republic of China, all provinces and cities should order their subordinate counties and cities to delineate elementary school districts according to the original population of rural villages and towns, and run short-term elementary schools. Each elementary school district should have an average population of about 1,000 people. Within every five to ten elementary school districts, an ordinary elementary school should be gradually established. The same applies to municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>According to the reports of various provinces and cities, it is estimated that more than 60,000 short-term elementary schools should be run this year. However, due to the difficulty in raising funds, the actual number that can be established will definitely be slightly less than the planned number. However, according to recent statistics, there should be at least 40,000 schools. Assuming that each school can accommodate 100 students, it can rescue 4 million children who are out of school.</p>
<p>The implementation of compulsory education is divided into three phases.</p>
<p>Phase 1: From August of the 24th year of the Republic of China to July of the 29th year, all older children who are out of school and school-age children who have not enrolled should receive at least one year of compulsory education. In order to provide children with one year of compulsory education, all provinces and cities should carry out the following matters:</p>
<p>(1) Promote short-term elementary schools: order all elementary school districts to set up one-year short-term elementary schools at the planned school locations, and recruit out-of-school children aged nine to twelve. This type of elementary school is based on the principle of adopting a two-part system, with half-day or full-day teaching in the morning and afternoon each day, with at least three hours or four hours of teaching. The duration of study is one year. Rural short-term elementary schools may have agricultural holidays. Ordinary elementary schools and other schools and public agencies may also set up short-term elementary school classes.</p>
<p>(2) Improve private schools: order all places to organize and improve the original private schools, and uniformly follow the curriculum of short-term elementary schools or ordinary elementary schools, and rename them improved private schools. The better ones may be changed to short-term elementary schools or ordinary elementary schools.</p>
<p>Pilot mobile education: order local authorities to set up mobile teachers to teach out-of-school children in poor and remote areas with inconvenient transportation, with the same level as short-term elementary schools. By the end of this phase, at least 80% of the total number of school-age children should have received one year of short-term elementary school education or equivalent education.</p>
<p>Phase 2: From August of the 29th year of the Republic of China to July of the 33rd year, all school-age children should receive at least two years of compulsory education. All provinces and cities will gradually change the one-year short-term elementary schools in each school district to two-year short-term elementary schools to recruit out-of-school children aged eight to twelve. The principle of adopting a two-part system is still adopted, and the duration of study is one year. By the end of this phase, at least 80% of the total number of school-age children should have received one year of short-term elementary school education or equivalent education.</p>
<p>Phase 3: Starting from August of the 33rd year of the Republic of China, the duration of compulsory education is set at four years, and the two-year short-term elementary schools in various places should be gradually changed to four-year ordinary elementary schools. During the second and third phases, the improvement of private schools and the pilot mobile education should continue to be carried out. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Original by Ms. Alcott of America, translated by Zheng Xiaocang (Zonghai)</p>
<p>"He can play, can't he?" Ned asked, but Tom couldn't speak at that moment because he had just stuffed a steamed apple into his mouth.</p>
<p>Tom had to nod to indicate, but somehow, after a while, he actually started talking again, saying, "Ah, isn't that right? We sometimes dance to his music and do gymnastics. I myself like a bronze drum and want to learn it as soon as possible."</p>
<p>"What I love most is the violin; I can play one too," Ned said, unable to stop confiding in this interesting topic.</p>
<p>"You can?" Tom asked, looking at him with wide eyes full of interest from the edge of his water glass. "Mr. Pei has an old violin, and he'll let you play it if you want."</p>
<p>"You ask if I can? Ah, that's what I miss the most. You see, I used to play the violin with my father and another person all the way to the docks until he died."</p>
<p>"Isn't that interesting?" Tom exclaimed in admiration.</p>
<p>"No, it was terrible; so cold in winter, so hot in summer. I was sometimes tired; they were sometimes annoyed, and I didn't have enough to eat," Ned said, stopping to take a big bite of gingerbread, as if to make himself truly believe that the years of hardship were over; then he said with a regretful expression, "But I did love my violin, and I feel uneasy without it. That person—Old Ni—took it after my father died and didn't want me anymore, saying I was sick."</p>
<p>"If you play well, they will want you to join the band. See what I say here."</p>
<p>"Do you have a band here?" Then Ned's eyes lit up.</p>
<p>"I think so; a lively and happy band, all boys; they sometimes hold concerts and things like that. You just have to watch out for it tomorrow night."</p>
<p>After saying these encouraging words, Tom went back to enjoying his dinner, while Ned gradually delved into flights of fancy, seemingly having no desire to taste the food in front of him.</p>

The swimming pool is open-air, accommodating 5,000 spectators. The entire pool is 50 meters long and 20 meters wide, with a capacity of 2,200 cubic meters, holding 600,000 gallons of water. The lighting in the pool consists of strong underwater electric lights, which are not only exceptionally beautiful but also prevent danger.

Another Rise of 5.2 Yuan <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>

Bullish forces had difficulty emerging strongly on a large scale, but major players such as Tongfeng Heng and others continued to buy up tirelessly, resulting in another rise.

The foreign exchange market suddenly tightened, and the buying mood became more obvious, and it rose to 16.5 yuan. The Central Bank took advantage of the high price to stuff out, and HSBC Mainland also came to sell, stimulating the selling trend. Inside the market, it was rumored that a certain bank sold bars, plunging by more than 10 yuan, but because the bank still drew on the cheap, buyers continued to be active, and the foreign exchange market also tightened with it, and soon rose back to outside the 10 yuan. People's hearts were already dazed, and Chinese businessmen stuffed out, and the domestic market suddenly showed weakness, and then fell downstream, falling back to 10 yuan. Banks took advantage of the cheap to draw, predicting that the Indian silver Xiaoer Anna would still be easily pulled up, but people's hearts were unsettled, the market was extremely dazed, and it was difficult to grasp. There were frequent ups and downs starting at noon. The afternoon market was stable due to the residual wind after the closing. After the opening, it fell slightly, and major players fell to buy in, gradually rising to outside 10 yuan. The foreign exchange market was normal, and although Indian silver was only down by one Anna, sellers still poured in, and soon fell back. After entering the market, a certain major player still acted through other accounts, rising again to outside 10 yuan. Indian silver rose once back by one Anna. Although the rising trend was long-lasting, it finally hovered again.

<h3 id="e162">Tranquil Situation in the Financial Industry; Scarce Inflow and Outflow of Subsidiary Currency <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's market situation remained far from bustling, leaning more towards quietude. However, observing the situation from various angles, the recent market conditions, with scarce lending, have dashed hopes for adjustment in various industries. Most are now resigned to their fate. Therefore, financial operations are entirely languid. Yesterday, the overnight interest rate for foreign currency remained unchanged at two jiao. Requests for extensions and additional funds were universally rejected outright, which is telling. As for transactions in discounted bills, activity is slightly more vibrant compared to last month. Hence, the morning market saw a turnover of over 3.1 million, with new transactions exceeding 200,000. The afternoon market saw over 120,000 in transactions. In the small exchange, transactions exceeded 600,000. Transactions involving redemption of foreign pawned goods reached over 400,000, with new pledges exceeding 700,000. Regarding the inflow and outflow of banknotes, other banks have been issuing them to the fullest extent, so the four banks including Zhongzhong, Jiaoshi, etc., handle the most. Yesterday, they collected over 500,000 and issued approximately over 1 million. Customer sources amounted to 200,000, with outflows completely unmentioned. Money shops collected over 4.11 million in foreign public bills, over 723,000 in foreign overnight interest funds, over 500,000 in remittances from various sources, and over 300,000 to 400,000 in cash receipts. Regarding deposit information at the banks, foreign banks collected over 1.7 million to 1.8 million in bank drafts, over 3 million in various goods, foreign exchange, pawn, and miscellaneous funds, over 600,000 in telegraphic transfers, over 900,000 in foreign exchange settlement funds, over 800,000 in special transfers, and 500,000 in withdrawals. Chinese banks collected over 1.8 million in bank drafts, over 3.9 million in various goods, foreign exchange, tax, pawn, and miscellaneous funds, over 600,000 in telegraphic transfers, over 400,000 in special transfers, over 900,000 in foreign exchange settlement funds, and 600,000 in deposits. Japanese banks collected over 2.3 million to 2.4 million in bank drafts, over 5.7 million to 5.8 million in various goods, foreign exchange, pawn, and miscellaneous funds, over 800,000 in special transfers, over 400,000 in foreign exchange settlement funds, over 800,000 in telegraphic transfers, and 400,000 in withdrawals. As for other special funds, there is little lending at present, so there is no new lending news to record.</p>
<p>The market for subsidiary currency has been very calm for days. Yesterday, there was virtually no trading in Jiangnan small silver coins. Thus, the market price, except for slight fluctuations in the early market, remained unchanged in the afternoon. The early market price was 835 yuan, a slight decrease of two yuan compared to the previous day's early market. Only 2,000 jiao worth of transactions were made. There were no transactions in the afternoon market, and the market price did not move. Guangdong small silver coins were priced at 735.4 yuan in the early market and 735 yuan in the afternoon, down by four jiao. Transactions amounted to 210,000 jiao in the early market and 75,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins remained unchanged at 343,000 wen, with 41,160 strings of wen transacted, equivalent to 12,000 yuan in foreign currency. Furthermore, the total amount of bills cleared in the city was 9,217,852.54 silver yuan, which included a total of 3,230,151.18 silver yuan exchanged, 3,455,706.53 silver yuan in remittances, 1,695,584.75 yuan collected by money shops, and 836,410.08 yuan collected by others.</p>

<p>Yesterday at the China High Securities Exchange, the market trended in a chaotic and fluctuating state. The long positions for No. 48 remained unmoved, with some scattered absorption, but the amount was minimal. Numbers 20 and 21, etc., saw some buying, while No. 5 and the Northern Gang sold. Transactions by each group were not particularly enthusiastic. Therefore, market prices tended to fluctuate unpredictably. Throughout the day, retail investors absorbed stocks at the opening, and the "Disbandment Bonds" surged by four jiao and a half. Later, the Northern Gang sold, and from the 20-series forward contracts onward, the market suddenly turned downward. The 23-series fell by a small fraction of three jiao, indicating the uncertainty of market sentiment. Consequently, the leading bonds in the second session also became weak. However, Numbers 20 and 21, etc., saw more buying, and from the 20-series onward, the market suddenly recovered. The sixth series rose by three jiao and a half, fluctuating sharply before settling at a flat price. The final market results showed "Disbandment Bonds" closing slightly higher by two jiao, while the remaining bonds remained lower by five fen to three jiao. The 96-series remained stable, neither gaining nor losing. The total transaction volume reached 5.97 million yuan.

<h3 id="e165">Yarn and Cotton: Awaiting the U.S. Cotton Estimate; Little Action from Bulls and Bears in Yarn and Cotton <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market, after its recent rapid rises and falls, is gradually showing signs of calm. Today, the market situation is unusually stable, mainly because most investors still expect prices to rise and have not yet released their absorbed positions. As for sellers, seeing that the current yarn market is gradually becoming sluggish and there is no hope of improvement, they are also holding their short positions. Additionally, with the U.S. cotton estimate to be released tomorrow, both bulls and bears are taking a cautious approach. As a result, market transactions are very quiet.</p>
<p>Gold Medal Brand Stabilizes</p>
<p>The opening of the forward yarn market saw prices rise across the board by six to seven jiao due to the upward trend of the previous day. Furthermore, the gold standard rose again to over 915 yuan. Consequently, market sentiment remained strong. Although new sellers were not enthusiastic, many investors, seeing that actual demand was weak, released some of their holdings at the涨, so the situation was not particularly tense. However, most firms were in long positions, unanimously expecting prices to rise. Nevertheless, the domestic economy was still weak, and commercial development was difficult. The market turned weak at the third close due to bulls releasing their positions. As a result, prices for each month fell by two to three jiao compared to the previous day's close. The afternoon opening saw a quiet atmosphere in the market. Very few transactions took place between bulls and bears. Business hours were quite short. Both bulls and bears must wait for tomorrow's U.S. cotton report to decide their next move. As a result, prices for each month rose by two jiao compared to the morning close. It was found that Yida sold 1,400 bales, Taixing 850 bales, Hengde 500 bales, Changfeng 450 bales,润康 (Run Kang) 400 bales, Shengyuan 500 bales, and Shenji 410 bales. Dafeng bought 350 bales, Daji 1,000 bales, Renfeng 650 bales, Yichang 450 bales, Changfeng 1,100 bales, and Xincheng 500 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Forward Yarn Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Change in Price Inventory</p>
<p>August 172.6 171.5 171.8 Down 0.10 25,900</p>
<p>September 172.3 171.1 171.7 Up 0.20 46,050</p>
<p>October 172.4 171.6 171.9 — 57,850</p>
<p>November 172.0 171.8 171.9 — 56,000</p>
<p>December 172.3 171.8 172.1 — 52,300</p>
<p>January 172.4 171.7 171.9 Down 0.30 10,250</p>
<p>Total 248,350</p>
<p>Yarn Sales at 200 Bales</p>
<p>The sales of current yarn remain weak. According to statistics from various firms, only 100 bales were bought throughout the day. Market prices were flat and weak. The purchase amounts of each firm are as follows:</p>
<p>Inland 138 Jiangxi 10 Haizhou 30</p>
<p>Changsha 6 Shantou 5 Ningbo 1</p>
<p>Other Firms 5 Wuhu 5</p>
<p>The cotton market also remained calm. However, bulls held onto the August contracts strongly, refusing to release them and failing to dispel their intentions of squeezing short positions. According to some sources, the long positions held by cotton companies for near and far-term contracts amounted to approximately 80,000 bales. Therefore, as soon as the market eased, they added to their positions. Additionally, the gold standard remained firm, and large amounts of額子 (e zi) were held tightly, making the market relatively high.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Stable</p>
<p>The opening of the forward cotton market saw prices rise slightly by five fen across all months. Because the gold standard surged again to over 915 yuan, an increase of 13 yuan compared to the previous day, market sentiment became urgent. Buyers were active, and Daji again came to cover their short positions, making the market tighter. Prices continued to rise by one jiao in the second session. However, as gold prices rose and then fell again at the second closing, and the yarn market weakened slightly, cotton prices turned weak. As a result, the August contracts remained unchanged compared to the previous day's close, while far-term contracts fell by five fen to one jiao and a half. The afternoon opening was extremely ordinary. Furthermore, with the U.S. cotton production estimate to be released tomorrow, one source said that the weather was good and the quantity would definitely increase. Another source said that the estimate would fluctuate between 20 to 30 pounds. The government's forecast was 11,342,000 bales, which was less than private estimates. Both bulls and bears were waiting for the estimate to act. Transactions were very scarce. As a result, prices for each month rose by five fen to one jiao compared to the morning close. It was found that Shenji sold 800 dan, Yuan Yi 1,500 dan, Chang 900 dan, Da Chang 1,400 dan, Yi Kang 800 dan, Ruiyuan 1,400 dan, Yicheng 1,600 dan, and Hexing 700 dan. Daji bought 4,700 dan, Shenchang 1,800 dan, Changhe 1,800 dan, and Changfeng 2,000 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>

<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton opened lower, with prices falling by four to six points across all months. Transactions were mainly for both parties to close out positions in anticipation of the release of the government report. Subsequently, due to selling by foreign firms, cotton farmers selling to lock in profits, and good weather, the market remained weak. After Liverpool made purchases, the government also bought forward cotton to offset the sale of spot cotton from stockpiles. Market prices then recovered. The government report, due to loan issues, would have little impact on market prices unless it was unexpected. Finally, long positions for October contracts were closed out, and the market price fell sharply by twelve points. Prices for the remaining months fell by one to two points. Spot prices fell by ten points. British spot cotton fell by one point, and futures fell by one to two points. Indian seven and eight-month white Luo Creek cotton saw prices rise sharply due to shortages. Pingguo cotton rose sharply by 1.75 rupees, Aomula rose by 0.25 rupees, white Luo Creek rose by 4.75 rupees, and far-term contracts rose by 0.25 rupees. The original telegraphic record is on the left:</p>

<h3 id="e168">Grains: Long Positions Being Closed; Difficult for Flour Market to Become Overly Enthusiastic; Flour Exchange to Resume Afternoon Trading Next Week <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>The flour market rose again yesterday. The quoted price for foreign wheat from Chicago was up four 分 to one 角零, and from Canada it was up four 分. Market sentiment was good due to rising gold prices, and prices for all months were uniformly favorable, one to two 分 higher than the closing price of the previous day. Subsequent trading sessions were still active, but the market remained fluctuating. New buyers were unable to become sufficiently active, and long-term bullish investors started to close their positions. Therefore, although most people were still optimistic, it was difficult for the market to become overly enthusiastic. As for the current market for flour sales, the Tianjin market was reportedly active. Yesterday, the market opened with 30,000 bags of standard flour at a price of 2 yuan, 4 角, 2 分, 7 厘 and a half. As a result, the prices for this month were 1 分 and a half higher, 1.5 分 for September, 2 分 for October and November, 1.5 分 for December, and 1 分 higher for January.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Flour Exchange will resume afternoon trading starting next week. The Coarse Grains Exchange will resume full-day trading starting from the 9th.</p>
<p>The bran market has stabilized. Since the removal of products is inconsistent, there are few certainties as to how the prices will be. Yesterday, Fuxin bran was quoted at 2 yuan and 2 角, while miscellaneous brands were quoted at 2 yuan and 1 角 and a half.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Favorable Sentiment for Wheat Futures <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market was bullish in the morning after opening. Although the quoted price for foreign wheat was only up by four 分 to 角零, the market sentiment, both within and outside the industry, was naturally good due to the rebound in gold prices. Therefore, after opening, the prices for each month were all quoted at two to three 分 higher. Furthermore, with no sign of easing in domestic wheat prices, sentiment within the industry was firmly stable. However, sluggish credit conditions would only allow for a rebound when absolutely necessary. As a result, this month rose by three 分, September by two 分, October by four 分, and November and December by two 分. In the current wheat market, there was no official sighting of wheat in the northern market. It was only heard that brokers at the闸口 (zha kou) were directly allocating 5,000 bags or so to factories, with prices similar to the previous day. As for the southern market, Shandong wheat was quoted at a high price of 3 yuan and 7 角 and 3 分, Yanghe wheat at 3 yuan and 7 角, and Yaowan wheat at 3 yuan and 6 角 and a half.</p>

<h3 id="e170">Reduced Sales Due to Rain, Adjustments in River Rice Prices - New Early Indica Rice Arriving Gradually from Various Locations <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's (Shanghai North) sources from 河下 (He Xia) for various firms numbered 12 or 13. Due to reduced sales caused by rain, the prices for the upper grades of white粳 (jing) rice from the Northern Firm were adjusted down by about one 角, while prices for secondary grades remained stable. The prices for freshly harvested 薄稻 (bao dao) rice with premium quality were slightly higher by about a 尺, while the prices for medium to secondary grades were reduced by one to two 角. Nearly 1,000 shi of Dongxin粳 (jing) rice arrived, with normal transactions and stable prices. Other varieties saw slightly softening prices. (Shanghai South) Only 7 or 8 boats (totalling 1400-1500 shi) arrived. The market continued to be weak, and sentiment was low. The market was sluggish due to rainy weather and scarce customers. Only the Qingdao Firm purchased over 400 packages. The overall situation was weak and unpromising, and market sentiment declined. The prices for Su Tong粳 (jing) rice and Nangang early rice declined by several 分 to one 角. The prices for 青角 (qing jiao), 松泗 (song si), and other 薄稻 (bao dao) rice fell further. As for Dongxin rice, prices remained stable due to the rain, but阴变 (yin bian) rice prices softened slightly. Prices for Duyangjian rice also appeared mediocre due to intermittent arrivals.</p>
<p>The market for foreign rice has relaxed its bullish momentum. New early Indica rice from various provinces is continuously entering the market. Yesterday, 100 bags of new early rough rice from Yongjiang arrived. 250 bags of aged rough rice also arrived. There is still a large quantity of previously stored foreign rice in Hangzhou, 硤石 (xia shi), and other places, which has recently been returned to Shanghai for sale. Although the amount arriving is small, sales of foreign rice are becoming even more sluggish. The market may gradually decline from now on. However, there is still interest in domestic and Ningbo markets for second-grade foreign rice, and there are also a small number of catering requests from Northern, Nanjing, and the Yangtze River regions. Therefore, the market is still able to maintain stability. The total daily sales consisted of 3,500 bags of Saigon rice, 2,200 bags of Siamese rice, and over 1,000 bags of 小絞高貢 (xiao jiao gao gong) and early rough rice. The prices were similar to the previous market. The initial quoted prices for new early rough rice from Yongxin were 8 yuan, 8 角, 5 分 to 8 yuan, 4 角, 5 分, and aged early rough rice was priced at 8 yuan, 3 角, 5 分.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the market conditions for foreign firm's red and green tea were both trending towards quietness. Many European firms had sent out a large number of telegrams last week, and there were few replies. Furthermore, due to the unstable exchange rate in recent days, most are adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Only Tongfu, Tianxiang, Yih和 (Yi He), Fushi and other firms bought Qimen black tea and green teas such as 珍眉 (zhen mei), 针眉 (zhen mei), 凤眉 (feng mei), 麻珠 (ma zhu), 贡熙 (gong xi), etc., for a total of over 600 boxes. The market price for 珍眉 (zhen mei) was two to three yuan lower than before, while the rest were stable.</p>

<p>Regarding black fungus, the water level in Hankou has receded recently, and the supply has gradually increased. According to a telegram from Hankou yesterday, 500 packages of堰耳 (yan er) arrived, and the price had dropped to 88 yuan, a difference of five to six yuan compared to before. It was sold out immediately. It is heard that 300 to 400 packages of漳耳 (zhang er) and 口耳 (kou er) are still en route, and the market may loosen further in the future.</p>
<p>The price of Hunan lotus seeds has also decreased due to the recession of the water level. The price of new 衝蓮地 (chong lian di) was 41 yuan and 4 角, and the price of new 壳裏蓮 (ke li lian) has also dropped to 34 to 35 yuan. However, sales were sluggish, and the market may be difficult to sustain in the future.</p>

<p>Due to a sharp drop in market prices, supplies of Shantou tangerine peels had been cut off for a long time. Sales have been slightly more active recently, and the remaining stock is also small. Yesterday, the market price was 22 yuan, an increase of two yuan compared to before. According to letters from the production area, the cost of shipping to Shanghai is 25 to 26 yuan. Therefore, even with an increase of one or two yuan, they are still upside down. The price foundation is quite firm.</p>
<p>Due to poor sales, no red rice has arrived for a long time. According to those who were asked, those who stored the red rice were selling at a loss. It was recently heard that the output of Shantou is not high, and the price of procuring it has increased by two to three yuan. Therefore, the Shanghai market has also risen by around one yuan, with a further tightening trend.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was relatively flat as tariff revenue saw little fluctuation. The association's fixed prices were 17 yuan and 1 角 for No. 24 raw sugar white spot, unchanged from the original price. There were some transactions. Resale goods were offered at 5 yuan and 3 角, but no deals were made. Zhenyuhao's refined sugar, as there were few spot goods, was quoted at 16 yuan and 4 角, but there were no buyers. There were more than 500 bags of Huanggangqing sugar offered by the Chaozhou merchants, with the higher-priced ones at 9 yuan and 8 角 and slightly lower for the rest, and more than 300 bags of lower-grade cotton red sugar offered at 10 yuan and 3 to 4 角, which were eagerly snapped up by buyers. According to a private telegram from Haikou sugar merchants, there are rumors that control has been implemented. Whether this is true remains to be verified.</p>

<h3 id="e176">The World Through a Pin Hole <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>The world seen through a pinhole might actually exist as such: viewing Mount Tai as a small hill, and Sumeru as a mustard seed. The objective world is certainly not that small; however, the world of man is certainly not that large. In the man-made world, the world you can perceive to exist is only the size of a pinhole. Thus, all you can know is: how much is a liter of rice, how much is a pound of firewood, how much is a foot of cloth, where there's easy money to be made, and where there are women to be had. If you fall short of this standard, you're a fool. If you exceed this standard, you're a heretic. A fool is at most material for jokes, but for a heretic, the "ancient" method is "to punish according to the law." The Pharisees crucifying Jesus is a perfect example of this. Fools provide material for jokes, and heretics uphold the dignity of the law. A few fools, a few heretics, dealt with using ancient methods, sent to the cross, or "banished to distant lands," and the integrity of society is no longer a problem. However, people are not uniform. Each has their own face. Even if you use the Spartan method of killing infants to force uniformity, human power is ultimately finite. There are countless fools, and not a few heretics either. This is difficult. On the other hand, even if you consider yourself qualified, some European eugenicists, supposedly based on biology, assert their scholarly authority and bluntly declare people of color to be inferior races. Whether this theory is correct or not, our pedantic scholars, self-proclaimed authorities of the ×× school, often pick up the leftovers of foreigners, saying our race is this way or that way. If that's the case, wouldn't we all become fools, or threats to white culture? When that time comes, the problem will be quite serious.</p>
<p>Naturally, the few white people who say this have their own purposes, and whether we believe this doctrine is up to us. If you believe it and are willing to be ranked as inferior, that's another matter. If you don't believe it and want to strive for a better future, you must kick this slanderous rhetoric away. But there's a prerequisite: when this race faces unprecedented danger, our eyes should leave the pinhole, and the world we observe should not be about how much is a liter of rice, how much is a pound of firewood, how much is a foot of cloth, where to find easy money, or where to find women. Individual existence is finite, but the continuation of the race is infinite. The question is whether to seek personal enjoyment in the present, or to pursue the infinite continuation of the community. If we take the former path, then there's no need to recognize anything. If we take the latter path, we must use the strength of a lion fighting a bull to fight against external forces and natural disasters. The crux lies in this process. Therefore, the current period is just as Dickens said at the beginning of "A Tale of Two Cities": "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times,... it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way..." These words can explain everything about this era. However, we certainly don't need to despair or fear. Social change is the process of social evolution. H.G. Wells said in the preface to his book "The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind": "...all of us are only now beginning to realize that we are living in the decadence of any system of our age, in a chaos, from which a new one will grow. All kinds of forces are currently carrying out the work of disintegration, but at the same time, they are constructing a new atmosphere of a larger, stranger institution, where we will adapt to life." Dispelling the old and bringing forth the new is an inevitable process. And the only task for people, as the driving force of society, is to broaden their horizons, exert their human power, gather together, and fulfill their human responsibilities!</p>
<h3 id="e177">Welcoming Mei <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Dr. Mei Lanfang is said to have returned with honors.</p>
<p>Among the clamorous voices, there are several viewpoints: A says that since Chinese opera is so popular in Europe, it must have a bright future. B says that Dr. Mei's return from Europe will lead him to adopt the strengths of European drama to compensate for the weaknesses of Chinese opera, creating a new form of opera with Chinese opera as the foundation and Western drama as the application. C says that Dr. Mei is to Europeans what African savages are, merely a curiosity, and its significance is no greater than Landauer's around-the-world tour. It would be an exaggeration to overestimate or underestimate Mei Lanfang's European tour. It would be a delusion to think that Mei Lanfang's drama will cause a major change in the European opera scene, and it would be too much to expect that Dr. Mei's hasty tour would bring about major changes in Chinese opera. Of course, it is also a half-baked opinion to say that Dr. Mei's tour was completely meaningless, and we cannot agree with that.</p>
<p>The form of art is often renewed: adding a transformation to an extremely old form creates a brand new style. It's like a cheongsam worn by a modern girl, it doesn't feel out of place. The currents of world art, East and West, have always irrigated each other and cannot be separated. For example, Guanyin Bodhisattva contains elements of Greek mythology, adds Indian colors, and is then painted in China. No one can say it belongs to a specific time or place. Western opera has inherited many artistic forms from the Hebrews and Egyptians, and Chinese opera has absorbed artistic forms from the Western Regions and India. Russia, located between Europe and Asia, has long been infused with Eastern colors. Mei Lanfang's performance may make them pay more attention to the form of Chinese opera, which is not impossible. On the other hand, Mei Lanfang saw many Western opera forms, and it is natural for him to use them to change the form of Chinese opera. But these are all gradual improvements, and the opera world will not be stirred up by this, and Chinese opera will not have a bright future because of this.</p>
<p>What I want to ask Dr. Mei is: has Dr. Mei made any changes to the content of the opera, which belongs to the conscious part? Speaking of opera, Qilin Tong's "Nine Watch" can indeed move the audience; the advertisement often sees the words "Nine Watch replaces rolling on nail boards." But that is a script that promotes feudal philosophy. Although there is still the fact that landlords take turns to serve in rotation, and the slave system still exists everywhere, we will never admit that "substituting for rolling on a nail board" has the meaning of "human." Another example is the auspicious opera "Hundred Longevity Pictures," which should clearly depict the tyranny of warlords and the grief of the emperor in a declining era, but it is performed as the princess's dignity is inviolable, and the emperor acts as a mediator, and then the couple reconciles as before, its distortion of facts has long lost the meaning of the times. The decline of Chinese opera is not the decline of form, but the decline of content. Old opera takes the protection of the morality of the rural patriarchal society as its only mission. Since the rural patriarchal society has completely collapsed, the flowers growing on that land have naturally withered. If Dr. Mei's view of social reality has not been thoroughly changed, and the content of the opera has not been completely changed, any kind of improvement is in vain.</p>
<p>I don't have too high expectations for Dr. Mei, I only hope that he will not let down this trip to Russia.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Guan Zi Jiao Seaside <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Fei Er</p>
<p>Penang, I haven't seen you for half a year. I went to Guan Zi Jiao Seaside. It was night, and the lighthouse flashed a ray of sunlight on the sea. The tide of the Penang Strait played a low and tranquil tune. The breeze gently blew on the back of the chair where I was sitting, and the coast of the Malay Peninsula in the distance shimmered with faint lights. The world was in darkness, the sounds of the city in Penang's residential area were unusually low, and the sea gently kissed the coast with a hypnotic melody. Stars twinkled in the sky, and the beautiful sea surface played the music played by the music pavilion behind. An exchange of natural and human sounds, blended into a harmonious rhythm. The soft air, the melodious music, the gentle tide, and the bright light emitted by the lighthouse, all converged into the beauty of Guan Zi Jiao Seaside. If the sea of Singapore is magnificent and heroic, then the thin slice of sea in Guan Zi Jiao is delicate and gentle. The tide of Singapore stirs up people's ambition and enthusiasm, while the sea of Penang teaches people to sink into the deep realm of art. The bright sea surface of Singapore allows people to unfold the wings of deep fantasy, while the beautiful sea surface of Penang teaches people to open the eyes of artists. If the sea of Singapore is lovely, then the sea of Penang is no less nostalgic.</p>
<p>The next day, I also went to the seaside called Fun. That is completely a rustic seaside scene. In front of the sea lies a vast beach, and the afternoon sun turns the fine sand into gold. The shore is pillowed by a large expanse of green, and scattered figures float in the sea water. In the distance, faint city sounds occasionally drifted in, and the chirping of birds resounded clearly. Occasionally, a sail floated on the sea, and a wisp of light white clouds floated in the sky. The air here is as silent as in the evening, and the sea lies quietly, as if in a deep sleep.</p>
<p>The entire coastline of Penang is under the overlook of the beautiful mountains, and the Penang Strait is sandwiched into a dark green brocade ribbon. Although it has lost the magnificent appearance of the sea, I love it like a noble work of art.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Child <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Chai Dake</p>
<p>The child is six years old, growing up day by day, very lively; he is also naughty, and like other children, he wants to eat and play. Not satisfied with eating his fill, he urges his mother for more. He plays when he grows up, and doesn't know fatigue. When he plays hard, he even forgets to eat. His mother's calls remind him, and then he goes to the table listlessly. He is happy when he laughs, and he cries when he is angry, just like other children. He doesn't know resentment. All he does is look at the older brothers, younger brothers, older sisters, and younger sisters next door, and he feels envy because he doesn't have any. But he doesn't have any after all, so he is angry and hateful, and when he hates fiercely, he vents his anger by crying. According to his mother, she told him: "Other people's older brothers, younger brothers, older sisters, and younger sisters cannot be taken away and considered Baby's; just like Baby's ball, wooden gun, and bayonet are Baby's, and cannot be taken away by others. Baby is born from Mama: is Mama's, so Mama loves!" The child doesn't know what older brothers, younger brothers, older sisters, and younger sisters are all about. All he knows is that only Mama belongs to him; he belongs to Mama, but he feels that the older brothers, younger brothers, older sisters, and younger sisters next door are very cute; he gets along well with them, so he loves to play with them. Of course! They also love this adorable child. The child is afraid to approach, only the mother of the children next door.</p>
<p>"Beggar... little rascal..." The mother of the children next door often scolds the child like this. "Beggars are such disgusting things." The child thinks, "Isn't that the kind of dirty, skinny one?"</p>
<p>"It would be great if I had an older brother or sister!" Whenever he feels lonely, he always hopes for this. If the hope is realized, who says? Isn't this child the happy one? But he is permanently immersed in this resentment. Only when he plays with the older brothers and sisters next door... does he temporarily forget this resentment, but when he is thinking about something alone, this resentment immediately enters his little chest.</p>
<p>"The older brothers and sisters next door... are together all day long. If Baby had an older brother or sister, he could also play in the same room all day long; eat at the same table: sleep on the same bed!" When his mother goes shopping, he is truly lonely! He needs one or two older brothers, older sisters, younger brothers, and younger sisters!" The child is somewhat suspicious and asks his mother, "Since the children next door are not Baby's older brothers, older sisters, younger brothers, and younger sisters, why does Baby call them older brothers, older sisters, younger brothers, and younger sisters?" Although the child feels that the children next door treat him very well; and at the same time, they are calling each other affectionately.</p>
<p>"Call if you want, but they are not Baby's older brothers, older sisters, younger brothers, and younger sisters after all! Baby's older brother... is...?" His mother answers with tears in her eyes. The child is very strange! Whenever he mentions wanting an older brother or sister, his mother always chokes up and can't speak! The child feels that his mother's sobs are cute, that she can sympathize with him for not having an older brother or sister! Unlike the mother of the children next door, who hits and scolds people at the drop of a hat! And separates his only playmates.</p>
<p>The child doesn't like to see his mother's often sullen face, and he never hears his mother's giggling laughter. He is happy; his mother is not necessarily happy. Only when he is naughty; his mother will put on a funny face and smile to tease the child to laugh. When the child is learning to read, his mother is also smiling. The child realizes that only learning to read can bring out his mother's smile, because the child likes to see his mother's smile.</p>
<p>The children next door wear flowered and red clothes; their hats are inlaid with sparkling glass pieces, which look very good. The child also loves them, only hating that he always wears white trousers; a black hat; and a blue short shirt, such plain colors. Isn't that right! That day, the child clamored for a red jacket, and his mother cut a short jacket out of a piece of red old cloth for the child on the street.</p>
<p>"The older brothers and younger brothers next door... are coming to snatch Baby's red cloth jacket! Mama! I... I won't give it to them!" That night, he woke up from his dream screaming like this, because this red cloth jacket was his only beloved thing. The father of the children next door always has to come home a few times after a long time, and he always brings back some toys and food to make the children happy. Isn't that a tall figure, just like the chauffeur of the family across the street!" The child remembers it this way, but the shadow of the child's father has never returned. The child has never seen a tall man. He is his ideal father. According to his mother, "Daddy is making money in a very far place." The child thinks: Daddy not only doesn't love him; but he also doesn't love Mama, otherwise, why doesn't he come back to see Mama! Because he sees his mother cry when she talks about Daddy.</p>
<p>The child thinks: "Daddy is really a scary animal. Aren't the children next door often beaten by their daddy and scream loudly! Aren't their butts all black and blue!"</p>
<p>"Daddy must be a terrible person!" The dad of the children next door is making money; the child's dad is also making money; making money is the same; so the fierceness is also the same. He firmly affirms that Daddy is such an animal. Thinking of Daddy makes him afraid, he tries his best to push the fantasy out of his mind, but the more he thinks about it, the more afraid he becomes, and he has nightmares at night, dreaming of a strange and ferocious man hitting him hard. Fortunately, Daddy never comes back, which makes him half relieved.</p>
<p>The child also connects that his mother cries whenever she talks about Daddy, definitely because Daddy hit Mama. In this way, the child firmly hopes that his daddy will never come back, but at the same time, he needs an older brother who is as lovable as Mama...</p>

<p>— Written by the German Storm translated by Chen Yinzhi</p>
<p>We walked through the shady path into the forest, and were almost to the path leading to the dance house, when we saw a crowd of people gathered on the beach from the other side of the woods. They were standing close to the water, seemingly busy placing something unclear on the ground. At this moment, a man in fishing clothes came up the mountain. "What's going on down there!" I asked casually.</p>
<p>"Not a good thing, sir!" he replied, "A young girl drowned."</p>
<p>"Nelly ah!" I shouted, unconsciously grabbing Fritz's hand.</p>
<p>He shouted in fright. "What are you saying!" he said, to cover up his feelings.</p>
<p>At the same time, we intimately walked through the woods down to the beach. On the road, I heard the crowd below talking about this. "What was wrong with her?" a rough male voice said. "This is probably a noble lady, you see she jumped into the water dressed neatly." Then there was no sound, only the sound of waves rolling in the morning air.</p>
<p>When we came out of the woods, the entire bay was covered in sunlight, and I was almost dizzy from being illuminated by it. She also lay under this sunlight. As we approached, the fishermen made way to the side; we could see her clearly. Without any obstruction. Was it really her? There was no longer any doubt! A pale face rested on the beach; a pair of dancing feet now motionless protruded from under her clothes; a head of wet black hair was covered with seaweed and shells. The white rose was no longer there, perhaps it had fallen to the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>Many years have passed since that early morning. — In the churchyard of the university town, next to the tall grass, lies a white marble stele, with the words "Lelyna Bolika" engraved on it. — This stele was erected by three fellow villagers scattered throughout Germany. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e181">The Heroic Deeds of Huaian Xin'an Elementary School Students <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>We still remember that two years ago, seven elementary school students from Huaian Qin'an Elementary School automatically organized a tour group to travel to Shanghai. The purpose of their organizing this tour group was to experience real social life and break the adult notion of distrusting children. They came out to travel without adult leadership, and all their daily life, food, and drink were managed by themselves. As soon as they arrived in Shanghai, they immediately became active, socializing, visiting, and giving speeches, just like an adult tour group, and everything was handled in an orderly manner. At that time, it attracted the attention of the general public.</p>
<p>Two years have passed, and now more noteworthy news has come. This time, Xin'an Elementary School has even greater ambitions, and their journey is much longer, a ten-province tour. The tour group this time has more than ten members. The oldest is nineteen years old, and the youngest is twelve years old. The time is tentatively set for three months. The travel destinations are ten provinces, including Lu, Ji, Cha, Sui, Shan, Yu, Wan, E, and Xiang. All expenses are borne by these elementary school students themselves, maintained by the income from selling books and giving speeches along the way. When necessary, they will show movies and play phonographs to carry out various publicity activities. It is said that all matters are now ready, and they can start off around the beginning of next month. This is truly an amazing feat.</p>
<p>Originally, school life cannot be completely separated from social life. Society is the school. In addition to receiving school education, a student must also personally experience various practical aspects of social life from time to time, in order to prepare for joining society and becoming active after leaving school. However, in our country's education, society is society. Schools and society are too far apart, almost as unrelated as the wind and the horse. This point should be improved. Xin'an Elementary School's two-time organization of tour groups, giving students the opportunity to experience social life in the field, this meaning is very significant.</p>
<p>However, although the intention of elementary school students to hold long-distance travel is good, this behavior is inevitably too risky. A ten-province tour is something even adults are afraid to try, and it is even more difficult for children. Moreover, in our country, transportation is inconvenient, the local area is not peaceful, and there are many obstacles along the way. Without sufficient guidance and safe measures, it is impossible to put people at ease. The school authorities should consider this point.</p>
<p>Finally, we hope that this ten-province tour of Xin'an Elementary School students will be a great success, leaving a glorious record in this children's year.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Cuiheng Village <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Ai Tu</p>
<p>Cuiheng Village—the hometown of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, what an enchanting name! It holds the breath of greatness, with exquisite flavors. I carried a heart of longing and traveled from the distant city to that place.</p>
<p>Leaving the bustling Shiqi, I boarded a long-distance bus of the Qiguan Company at the bus station on the pier. After purchasing a ticket to Cuiheng Village, I let the bus speed southward on the flat highway as if it were crazy. At that time, looking out the window, all I could see were expanses of plains and vast fields, with villages standing on the edges of the plains or hills. Sparse green forests seemed to express a melancholic sigh as the southern sea breeze rustled, like a sigh of joy—at this moment, although my eyes were watching the quickly passing suburban scenery, my mind was filled with the great historical relics of Cuiheng Village, filled with the thought of the many children who always greeted people with cheerful laughter there... everything possessed me.</p>
<p>Along the way, the carriage sped along, passing through high mountains and ornate villages that mixed the old and new. There, I could see many poetic pictures. Sometimes, by the babbling streams, I could see innocent and lively girls carrying baskets to the stones by the stream to wash clothes. Their completely sorrowless smiling faces revealed a captivating aura, and their innocent and adorable eyes blinked as they stared at the bus passing by them. Sometimes, their graceful, shy bodies danced joyfully, sending out interesting laughter. All of this truly made people who had grown up in the city feel that living in the countryside was very happy. Also, they wore large hats with a style different from other places, hats that only men wore in other villages. The tall, pointed, and wide bamboo hats, sometimes with a bit of decorative flair, worn slightly askew, showed a healthy demeanor that was absolutely different from the delicate and artificial posture of the daughters of big cities, who had lost their innocence.</p>
<p>The car traveled at high speed for about two hours before arriving at Cuiheng Village. I got out of the car and rested in a pavilion, inhaling the wind blowing from the mountains and the sea. At that time, my gaze fell on the small village below the forest, which was Cuiheng Village—not a very large village. The back mountain was covered with vast and lush green forests, and the whistling sound coming from the treetops was so energetic and rustling. The village's style was no different from other villages, perhaps in the style of the eighteenth century, but it was not dilapidated, and very stable. On the left side of the village, near the open space, were two slightly taller houses, which were the home of the President. It is said that he was from a prominent family in his childhood, and indeed, this historical trace is still very clearly left before our eyes. Therefore, their home was always a little more beautiful and exquisite than other homes.</p>
<p>In front of Cuiheng Village is a vast field, where the President must have been accustomed to playing in his childhood. Not far from the village across, there is a very quiet stream, and the banks of the stream are lined with green trees that are not very big. It is very possible to drive a small boat on the surface of the water. This is where the President threw the tablet of the local god into the water in his youth. The stream winds around, and far away, it makes people feel the beauty of the quiet countryside. Even in summer, this is still a place that can be used as a summer resort.</p>
<p>Next to Cuiheng Village is the new school building of "Mr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial School," tall, with red bricks and green tiles, with the Western flavor of the new century. When I went there, several teachers happily took me to see various places, and I also felt that their teaching performance would not be bad. Therefore, my heart was even more joyful.</p>
<p>While I was in the village, when the innocent and lively children followed us, smiling and asking questions, they were so friendly, unlike strangers, and took me to wander around many mountains, forests, and riverbanks. They also told interesting stories of the President's childhood with laughter, such as where the President loved the most. At this time, I was completely like a child who did not know sadness, laughing and jumping along with them. —Those lovely children have a demeanor different from other places!</p>
<p>In the afternoon, when the sun was about to set behind the forest, I left the lovely Cuiheng Village and boarded the bus again, hurrying towards the south.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Summer Evening <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>Summer evenings are the most comfortable time of day. Being cooped up in the office all day like a roasted duck, the numbers and documents almost made my head spin. Even though the fan never stopped spinning overhead, I couldn't feel any coolness from the wind, as if a warm current was about to engulf me. Moreover, something was twitching in my temples, and I felt nauseous, not even having time to chew on a Baifeng pill. In this way, I had to endure for eight whole hours, just like a prisoner who had lost his freedom, unable to control myself at all. Although I could lie on the sofa and steal a little laziness during the two hours after dinner, the sweat stains on my back were always slippery and uncomfortable. Naturally, what everyone hopes for is the evening.</p>
<p>For example: when you return home like a fugitive, the most urgent task is naturally to take a bath. So you suddenly—like a quick-handed magician, strip off all your clothes and jump into the bathtub. The bathtub is filled with just the right amount of warm water, and as you soak your tired body, you might forget that it is already evening outside with a myriad of lights. You enjoy this</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>indescribable comfort, like a dream, until your family calls you to have dinner, and then you feel that time has passed too quickly.</p>
<p>Then, after drying your whole body, your spirit is completely restored, and you put on thin clothes and have dinner in the courtyard. Your family must have prepared your favorite dishes especially for you, and if you are married, you have a child who can just hop and skip around. The pleasure of a family cannot be greater than this.</p>
<p>At this time, a moon like a new bud is hanging in the eastern corner of the sky, and the heat on the ground has also dissipated. You can open the door wide and let the cool evening breeze blow around your dining table. After a happy dinner, you move the dining table away, and everyone lies back in rattan chairs. And there must be herbal tea prepared for you to quench your thirst after dinner, or even half a leftover watermelon. And your child? He will not allow you to lie down quietly, but at this time, your spirit is very comfortable. You are very happy to tell him stories. You can make up whatever you want about Brother Cow and Sister Cat, but the child is very willing to listen. If you are in a better situation, and you can rent a larger yard, of course you will be very happy to plant some flowers and trees: the morning glories climbing on the high walls are the easiest flowers to grow. Just scatter some seeds along the base of the wall, attach them to the high wall with a few grass ropes, and they will quickly fill the entire wall with flowers. It is most pleasing to the eye to see more flowers and trees in summer. When you return from the office, you can also take a walk in the yard, watching them being scorched by the day's scorching sun, turning into a haggard woman, and you will feel a little sorry in your heart. But when the moon rises, they, like your spirit, have regained their former appearance: the drooping ones have raised their heads, and the withered ones have also released their flowers. Although they are all flowers and plants without fragrance, they have a fresh fragrance in the evening breeze. Around the yard, balsams and cockscombs are also indispensable, red flowers, green leaves; if you can plant a few pots of lotus flowers, that would be even better, with white flowers blooming on straight stems, and their fragrance is truly refreshing. In this situation, even if there is a lot of important work waiting for you to do, you will never be willing to leave. Smoking a cigarette, closing your eyes slightly, the stuffiness you suffered in the office just now has long since disappeared without a trace. After your child has heard enough stories, he is snuggling in his mother's arms, and perhaps in a few minutes, he is already snoring softly, fast asleep. Because it is after dinner, your wife will not let him sleep, so she calls him, shouts him, listens to Daddy tell stories, or eats watermelon, using all kinds of methods to wake him up, but children are the most free people in the world, and if he wants to sleep, there is no way to wake him up. Then, take him to the bedroom, but in the time it takes for your wife to go back and forth, you yourself will involuntarily fall asleep. When you are awakened, you will definitely not be able to help but laugh, and then stagger into the house. A lovely summer evening has passed quietly like this.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Boat Girl <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Da</p>
<p>The sun rests on the distant peaks of the dark green mountains in the west, like a burning red gong, listlessly drilling into the back of the mountains. Suddenly, the western sky burned with bloody clouds over most of the sky, with clusters of dark and beautifully scaled clouds.</p>
<p>Waves of crows, like a disbanded group of soldiers, flew from this side of the river to the jungle on the opposite bank without discipline, cawing and chirping, flying and desperately blowing their mouths, chattering enough to be annoying! However, it seemed to carry another kind of mission—awakening another group of pitiful people.</p>
<p>"Ruixiang, get up, it's not early... Hurry up and get dressed, look, the sun has already sunk behind the mountains." A plump, forty-year-old woman dressed in a short silk shirt and trousers was bending over at the stern of the boat, wiping the floor very carefully, cleaning the vases and teacups. She looked up at the sky and shouted loudly. At the same time, she seemed extremely tired, panting like an old ox working in the fields, muttering to herself, "It's really getting worse every year, I never thought that the things the old woman did would now be taken on by myself!"</p>
<p>Ruixiang woke up from her sleep, stretched lazily, calmed her mind, and then pushed open the small window on the left side of the boat, sticking out half of her melon-seed-shaped head to look around: the sky was clear, floating with light and fluffy clouds; the water was as green as distant mountains, rippling with fine waves. She thought in her heart, "The weather is so good, and it just happens to be the fifteenth night, the Moon Sister is growing a full, round face, so charming. With such a good time and beautiful scenery, it seems that tonight's business is definitely going to earn her dozens of silver dollars..." Thinking this, her heart blossomed, she smiled, pursed her mouth for a moment, and gave a charming cat-like wink, and quickly went to the dressing table to tidy up her disheveled hair that resembled a clump of grass.</p>
<p>The night breath gradually sank down, and the dim shadows of dusk, like an ambush of soldiers, slowly crawled out from where they were encountered, swallowing the distant dark green evening mountains. At this time, Ruixiang rested her right hand on her cheek, sitting in the front of the flower boat, looking very delicate and charming! Her face brushed against the colorful clouds in the sky, and her eyebrows were like two curved black lines. She was wearing a soft, thin silk cheongsam, her chest was very full, and the tips of her two new grave-like breasts stood out stiffly, as if they were about to pierce through this soft, thin silk clothing. She caught sight of the passing tourists on the shore, and threw a not-very-natural, seductive smile at them, like a foxy siren, trying to arouse their affections. However, despite her best efforts to throw seductive smiles, no one was willing to easily board the flower boat.</p>
<p>The moon slowly rose from the treetops on the opposite bank, full and round like a white jade plate, bright and clean, and suddenly a winding, endless silver snake rippled across the heart of the river. Although it was the dog days of June, it was still a cool place at night, and there was no need for palm-leaf fans. The cool breeze gently blew, bringing with it the fragrant aroma of the longan flowers on the opposite bank. This aroma had once intoxicated Ruixiang's heart, making her feel the preciousness and joy of life. However, now, the aroma of the longan flowers was still so fragrant and rich, but her state of mind was not the same as it was three years ago. She began to feel disappointed and tired, her head drooped heavily, and she sank very sadly into the dream of three years ago. The girls on the flower boats lived a life of singing and drinking, but who could have predicted that her door would be so desolate three years later, after the luxury of that life, the liveliness of the business, and the prominence of her reputation? To say that she was old and no longer attracting people's attention, Ruixiang would never dare to believe this reason. She often looked at herself in the mirror, and everything was no different from three years ago, her flesh was still fat and plump. What was the reason for the sluggish business? To say that it was because of the collection of flower donations, song donations, and feast donations... which made the people who frequented the boats reluctant to come, and they had no interest, this was not a sufficient reason! However, the sluggish business was already a fact, but what exactly was the reason, in Ruixiang's heart, it was an unanswerable mystery.</p>
<p>The night was deep, the moon hung coquettishly in the middle of the sky, and the tourists on the shore were sparse. Ruixiang quietly went into the flower boat with a heart full of disappointment.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Kidnapped (Part 1) <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Hao</p>
<p>The fields in the twilight presented a golden glow, the remaining radiance of the setting sun shining from the west of Da Niuyao Ridge. The evening breeze gently brought the warmth of midsummer, and fine grains of dust. Having taken a mule cart from Shalan all day, my buttocks felt a bit sore from the cobblestone path; moreover, I noticed the struggling of that poor mule, its hooves hitting like they were striking tens of millions of pounds of steel, and its large nostrils exhaling such rapid breaths; so I said to the mule driver who was whipping it: "Hey, friend, it's not early anyway! It's too late to rush, why not find an inn and stay overnight? Look, the mule is tired enough!"</p>
<p>"Yes, that's what I was thinking too, but let's hurry up a bit more, if we just drive the mule cart into Liuying Village, there will be inns there." The pockmarked mule driver raised his whip, a faint smile appearing at the corner of his mouth.</p>
<p>It was already evening when we drove into Liuying Village. We stayed at a larger inn. The owner was such a kind old man, although he was already old, his health and spirit were worthy of admiration; especially his cheerful conversational skills, with none of the current merchant's reserve.</p>
<p>Late at night. I pushed open the window, which was facing the inn's courtyard. In front of the window grew a low little tree. Looking through the gaps in the branches, I could see a round moon in the dark sky, and a few flickering stars; quietly, I couldn't hear any sound. Occasionally, I heard one or two howls of dogs, and the low moans of night owls. In my heart, there rose a lonely, melancholic thought: serene, mournful!</p>
<p>Suddenly, a series of "bang, bang, crash" sounds in the distance startled me from the lonely silence. I stared at the distant mountain range lying in the black atmosphere—where the sounds seemed to originate—my whole body trembled as if possessed by a demon. Unconsciously, I entered a realm of terror; at the time when I was recalling my past experiences, I subconsciously determined that it was the sound of gunfire.</p>
<p>"Get up, guests, get up quickly!" When I discovered the old owner's soft cry, my terror increased, because this was certainly the same as what I had just thought, and I also realized that the old owner's voice was so slightly trembling with panic. I gradually stood up my numb body, and walked out of the room step by step. Many guests had already gathered outside the door; everyone was holding a strange heart: "Hey, you, old owner, what's all the fuss about in the middle of the night?"</p>

<p>Liu Xiang's Preface to the Strategies of the Warring States (5)</p>
<p>Therefore, the Confucian scholars like Mencius and Xun Qing were abandoned by the world, while the strategists who traveled and persuaded were valued by the common people. Thus, Su Qin, Zhang Yi, Gongsun Yan, Chen Zhen, Dai, Li, and their like advocated the doctrines of alliances and disjunctions, using short and long strategies to influence states. Su Qin advocated alliances, while Zhang Yi advocated disjunction. If disjunction prevailed, Qin would become emperor; if alliances prevailed, Chu would become king. The state where they resided would be valued, while the state they left would be disregarded. However, at that time, the Qin state was the most powerful, while the other states were weak. Su Qin united them, forming a coalition of six states to resist Qin, causing everyone to fear and not dare to peep at its soldiers in the region within the passes. The world was free from war for twenty-nine years.</p>

One sees Li Yuanba with flowers in his hair, Chen Miaochang with a blue face and sharp teeth, Hongniang, a matchmaker, with phoenix hairpins and rosy pendants, and Zhang Fei jumping over the pink wall under the moon. A delicate and charming Pigsy, a joyful Hu Dahai, wants to pick Autumn Fragrance with all his heart. Yingying breaks Mount Motian, Du Liniang strikes the Zhu family manor three times, Zhaojun chops Huang Tianba with a knife, and Han Diaochan fights a tiger on Jingyang Hill. Wu Song sends Jinniang a thousand miles, and here comes Wu Dalang with the stature of ten feet. After watching the play, one returns home and chats with his wife and children, still uttering auspicious words in his mouth.</p>

<h3 id="e195">"Little Angel" Premieres Today <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Lianhua director Wu Yonggang became famous with the film "The Goddess." Now he is launching his new work "Little Angel," proving that with the excellent achievements in "The Goddess," it can be expected that he will make extraordinary contributions. "Little Angel" was commissioned by the Jiangsu Provincial Government. Chen Guofu, the chairman of the provincial government, has vigorously promoted the educational film industry in recent years. He once handed over his own script to various film companies to be made into films. Recently, he openly solicited scripts and selected "Little Angel" from hundreds of submissions as the first choice. Chen believed that Lianhua had the most outstanding achievements in film production, so he handed it over to the company for filming. The company then assigned the most outstanding directors and actors to produce it, taking five months to complete. With Lianhua's reputation, coupled with the cooperation of director Wu Yonggang and actors Wang Renmei, Lin Chuchu, etc., the excellent results can be imagined. The film is now scheduled to premiere at the Jincheng Grand Theater today.</p>
