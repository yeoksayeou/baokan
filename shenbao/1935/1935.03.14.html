<h3>對經委會統一全國水利之我見</h3>
<p>— 緯</p>
<p>中國自水道失修以來。旱年則赤地千里撈歲則億兆爲魚。生命財產之損失。不可勝計。誠生民之浩刧。國家前途之殷憂也。邇來政府對於水利之建設。已知所注意。然尙日言水利而旱災不可免。日言治水而水災不能防者。非盡由於天時失常之無可挽救。實全國水利機關之不能收其應有之成效有以致之也。以往全國水利機關。據內政部二十二年調查。共有六十一處之多。系統紛歧。職權不相統屬。如此多而無當之機關。不獨銷耗水利經費。甚且一遇河水汎濫堤防將潰之日。不盡力搶堵。而反互相推諉。或互鬧意見。以致延誤河工。增重災情。所在皆是。故今日而言水利建設。第一步必須統一水利行政。使事權不紛。上有所主管。下有所統轄。然後乃能獲國家注意水利之實效。去歲國府訓令全國。「以經濟委員會爲全國水利總機關」。最近經濟委員會根據國府訓令。擬訂各水利機關整理方案。對水利機關之重疊者。實行裁撤合併。此誠深切時弊之改革。爲全國人民所樂於聽聞者也。雖然吾人尙欲有所言者。</p>
<p>水利建設。乃國家最艱鉅之事業。固非有一權力較大之專司機關。籌巨額之經費。作長久之服務。擬定整個計劃不能消弭水患。而樹水利建設之實績。然人才問題在今日實較一切更爲重要。過去水利機關及任職之專門人才。常因國內政治變動而遭更迭。有專才渚無專職。任專職者非專才。責無專司。事無專任。各水利機關之因此而形同虛設者。不　實指今者國內政治。漸趨安定。則任職水利機關之專家。自應使其久於其職。使有其才者安其位。負其責者任其勞。然後專家之長才可展。水政之成績可考。此有待於經委會之計劃設施者一。</p>
<p>中國河道。長者旦數省。小者亦通數縣。上下游之利害不同則上下游人士對於治水方法之利弊。意見自難一致。非全盤計劃。利害兼顧必致在上游者。唯以上游之利爲務。而下游有板蕩之虞。在下游者。唯以下游之免災是急。而上游有倒灌之憂。以言往事。有前歲蘇魯治運糾紛。皖豫引洛引黃入淮糾紛。以言近事。則有蕭宿數縣民衆爲疏濬奎河糾紛。以鄰爲壑與壅水不流。皆非策之善者。使宣洩與歸納。兩不相妨。上下游人士。各能贊助。非有整個計劃不可。此有待於經委會之計劃設施者又其一。</p>
<p>吾人今乘經委會發表初步改革水利計劃之機會。聊貢所見。倘能早日見諸事實。國人之幸也。</p>

<h3>四月一日　德國正式置空軍　柏林外部照會英法意　首次撕毀凡爾賽和約</h3>
<p>（柏林）德政府今日宣布德國空軍將於四月一日正式成立、此爲德國第一次破壞凡爾賽和約限制德國軍備之規定、其尤重要者、此舉可表示德元首希特勒實行德國重整軍備之决心、歐洲各國對於此項計劃未能與德相和諧、故德國乃於一九三三年毅然退出國聯與軍縮會、今復不顧一切、獨斷獨行、新空軍將歸普魯士總理兼中央航空部長戈林將軍指揮、加「飛行將軍」之銜號、全國將分爲五空軍區、另設海軍航空司令一員、新空軍之軍官職位與常備軍軍官同、惟制服稍有分別、聞德政府近曾以擬設空軍之舉正式照會英法意大使署之航空委員、此項照會、英國現仍在考慮中、羅馬政界則極注意德國之宣布、現就軍事與國家觀察點加以考慮、法當局表示意見、謂德國之宣布、實使根據二月三日英法在倫敦之妥協與德進行談判、尤急不可緩、德國現益將凡爾賽和約置之腦後、而以爲依偷敦討論所定之方針、作不可分之安全解决、實爲進達和平之唯一正道、按倫敦妥協規定德國重返國聯、英法德比意締結天空公約、以遏制任何簽約國之侵略、德國與他國、其軍備由和約限定者、均不得以片面行動變更此種義務、並主張作一總解决、規定歐洲安全之組織、至於德國、則凡爾賽和約中限制其軍備之第五項條文、今擬代以新者、凡此皆倫敦妥協之要點也、（十二日路透電）</p>
<h3>法內閣議決　延長兵役期限　自一年增至二年　再建大戰艦一艘</h3>
<p>（巴黎）內閣會議今日决議、自一九三五年至一九三九年之法國軍役期限、必須自一年增至二年、急進黨閣員向來反對以該間題訴諸五月間之市選舉、總理佛蘭亭屢接前陸長見當上將與其他軍事領袖之勸吿故抱有增固陸軍之决心、一切反對、皆在所不顧、據今日消息、政府除經費已由國會通過之三萬五千噸戰艦一艘外、今尙議於一九三七年、一月以後再建同噸量之戰艦一艘、政府謂此足證法國願遵守華盛頓海軍公約所定之噸位限度、至於其他簽字國、則均已開築此種噸位之軍艦云、（十二日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）本日國務會議討論法國兵役年限問題、查一九二=八年徵兵法律規定服役時期爲一年、然因大戰時法國出生率降低、故自本年起、法國新兵入伍人數减少、不能達到一九二八年徵兵法律所規定之數額、因此內閣閣員一致主張延長兵役年限、惟擬分爲兩個階段、分別辦理、在第一階段、先將本年四月十五日入伍新兵延長服役時期六個月、計共服役一年零六個月、此項計盡將於本星期五日由佛蘭亭總理提出衆院討論、其第二階段、則規定本年十月十五日入伍之新兵延長服役時期一年、計共服役兩年、此項計畫、須俟國會夏季休假後方行提出討論、蓋在此數月內、歐洲國際政局或有變更、各項鞏固和平之國際公約可望簽訂、軍縮會議可望重開、故在數月後、國會再行討論謀國家安全之必要條件、當更較適合時宜也、（十二日哈瓦斯）</p>
<p>（巴黎）政府頃向衆議院提出一九三五年海軍造艦程序之法案、要求建造新艦以替代陳舊之戰艦、卽如「戈爾倍」號及「巴黎」號兩艦服務已屆二十五年、勢必加以更換、一九三五年造艦程序共需一千六百萬日之工作、對於失業問題、不無補益、一九三五年至一九三九年間、海軍建造軍艦共需經費一·〇六五·〇〇〇·〇〇〇法郎、其中（一）七八五·〇〇〇·〇〇〇法郎用以建造戰艦、（二）一四八·〇〇〇·〇〇〇法郎、建造魚雷艇兩艘、（五）一三二·〇〇〇·〇〇〇法郎則係補充軍器及彈藥存貨之經費、至於各種軍艦噸數、倘能照華盛頓倫敦條約規定、由各主要海軍國重行談判、成立一般協定、自爲一般人所期望、然海軍質的限制、必經各國共同允諾而後有效、目前國際局勢使法國被迫、在質的方面不能再受何種新限制、惟法國爲避免始作俑者起見、故下屆海軍造艦程序中、各艦噸數仍遵照舊時之限制、卽一九三七年度造艦案亦然云、（十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（柏林）外交政治通報由政府授意、以「英國軍備政策勝利」爲標題、評論英國下院通過增加海陸空軍軍費一千萬鎊在政治方面之重要性、認此係英政府去年逐步變更政策所達之最高峯、及該政策所獲得之勝利、該報追述此項變遷稱、兩年以前、麥唐納首相及西門外相曾向日內瓦提出軍縮公約草案、對於一般軍縮表示明確之立塲、一年之後、掌璽大臣艾登復歷訪歐洲重要國家接洽軍縮、英國雖遇軍備充實國家之反對、然曾始終抱定裁軍之原則、及至去年五六月、軍縮會議開末次會議時、法外長巴爾都之態度遂使各事絕望、自是以後、卽未聞軍縮談話、僅討論安全問題矣、去年七月、英國宣布以萊茵河爲疆界、其時麥唐首相適自坎拿大歸來、發覺彼所服膺之國際理想主義、已成過去、代之者爲與戰前外交及軍事協約相似之政策、吾人於此必須暸解者、自此新政策抬頭後、國聯已失去其本有之重要性、英國政治家、因英國民意受信仰國聯者之薰陶甚深、故仍宣稱奉行國聯之原則、但事實上其他因素業已參入本星期一下院辯論時、政府發言人業已博得輿論贊成政府之新立塲、鮑爾溫之演說涉及蘇俄與他國之軍備、然已爲一星期前指摘德國國防計劃之徧面談話所抵消、同時西門外相則稱、歐洲某國不屬國聯、吾人仍應造成政治環境、使該國復返國聯合作云云、夫造成政治基礎、促成德國與他國之合作實爲歐洲政治之第一要事、西門外相訪德之行卽係此事之第二步驟、西門暫定三月底赴德、鮑爾溫已於星期一宜布此事、且西門曾稱、彼將以警意與友誼貫澈此行云、此當爲一般希望英德談話能有實質之成就者所樂聞也云云、（十三日國民電）</p>
<h3>中東路賣買成交後　日俄衝突危機未全滅　野心不戢和平難期　英泰晤士報之論評</h3>
<p>（倫敦）倫敦泰晤士報今日社論謂中東路賣買合同簽第一字之消息、可使人稍慰、此乃常識克服疑忌之勝利、雖日俄間關係緊張之種種暗因、未因此而消滅、但衝突原因之一今旣不存在、則此緊張已可鬆動、此項合同、表示雙方將不願有戰爭、足見頭腦穩健之政治家猶能支配以避免戰爭、尙望雙方軍民領袖繼續和衷接洽、如是則和平可以保矣云、（十三日路透社電）</p>
<p>新聞通信社云、據東京日報載滿鐵副裁對於中東路曾作如下之傲語、可見日方平日之野心一般、茲為譯錄如下、綜合全「滿」鐵路經營、實為日「滿」交通政策上最急之任務、但中東路之存在、對於此項實有極大之妨害、且阻止運輸交通圓滿之發展、今轉讓交涉業已成立、中東路將名實相符成爲「滿洲國」國有鐵路之一幹綫、而統制於國家經營中、刻正在努力準備接收、相信接收之後、火車一刻不至停頓、至少須保全照常開車、同時更信此後必能較蘇聯管理時得更多之利益、尤可喜者、六千名蘇籍路員現非歸國不可、所剩地位自可由日本人補充、故中東路買賣成功、不僅消滅蘇聯在遠東之赤化政策之策源地、且可解决日本失業問題、不僅除鐵路經營上障碍、實日「滿」兩國外交史上劃一之大成功云云」、於此可見日方之野心爲如何云、</p>

作人譯紅星佚史）裏，寫着海倫身後的故事，她是在埃及成爲梭哈之神，那是簡直就寫成美神了，可知這看法是很自然的。歌德的浮士德的第二部中海倫一幕，也可作同樣的看法。　　用中國眼光去看，作家所給與的典型的美的命運，是頗難以了解的。我們大概要認她的遭逢爲不幸，而覺得詩人是在寫紅顏薄命這情事。但特羅依的悲劇，悲劇是絲毫不在海倫方面的。海倫跟巴黎斯逃走，不一定就是一不幸的遭逢，而這也不一定就給海倫以不幸的結局，固然，有一個故事，說海倫在特羅依陷落之後，在里載她回斯巴達的船上，就遭惡死，以爲失節的婦女的榜樣，這和中國書上所記越國治吳以後沉西子於江的故事，頗有些相像。這種冷酷的寫法，顯然不是多數人所能同情的。就在中國，在冷酷的道德尙未充分發展的時代，也就不加以普通的承認，因之另外還有西子隨鴟夷泛五湖的傳說。而西洋人對於海倫的結局的會有別種解說，自屬當然了。　　海倫與巴黎斯的結合，顯然是道德以上的事情，這可以解作美與美的結合象徵，這樣其結合倒轉可說是理想的。同樣另一故事裏把海倫與亞奇勒斯結合，就形成英雄與美人的典型。世界之欲裏把她與奧德賽結合，則是美與智慧的調和。而浮士德中把她與浮士德結合，則是進一步要美與近代智慧和諧。他們可說都把這些結合看得比道德更爲重要。此之理想，道德是不足論的。　　後人的理想，當然不一定是荷馬的原意。但荷馬的並未必想到貞操，似無疑問。特羅依人不曾以海倫爲引起戰爭的禍水，反是樂於爲美而戰爭的。希臘人方面，其戰爭的原因，也與其說是爲復仇，無寗說是爲了踐諾共同保護美人的舊盟。兩方面都未嘗想給海倫以懲罰。要以一個女子的生命爲　椿事件的解决，要女子擔負某一事件的責任，都太卑怯了，不是英雄性格中所能容許的。在這情形下，女英雄自己，也無須感到自己有解决這事件的責任。這並不是很奇特的理想，以後的西洋文學中，也常寫出這種精神。恐怕這終是我們所難澈底了解的，我們故事上的戀愛鬥爭—如果還有够上說鬥爭的事情的話—中，其結果往往是女子演悲劇。女子自己全不覺得這悲劇的演出，太不值得；男子更毫不覺得這是自己的羞辱。社會也因見慣而無感覺；或者也可說簡直抱此要求，唐明皇縊楊妃以平衆怒，後來不就有詩人寫着「不聞商周間，中自誅姐姒」，的讚美詩麼？我不知道西洋人讀楊貴妃的故事作何感想，至少不會以爲唐明皇懂得戀愛吧！不講女人禍水觀，本身就有疑問，中國也就有人作過「西施若解亡人國，越國亡來又是誰。」的憤慨。就眞是禍水，則如隋煬帝的至死不悔，至少有精神些。長生殿有一節寫明皇懊悔心理的曲子道：「我若肯將身去抵當，他未必直犯君王！縱然犯了又何妨，泉臺下倒博得永成雙。」就揭露明皇的卑怯。再擴開說，卑怯的不僅明皇，陳元禮和六軍，不能像特羅依人戰希臘樣地去抵抗安祿山，隨着皇帝逃往西蜀，倒會要求一個女子的一死以洩氣，也就眞太「洩氣」（北平話的坍臺）了。小店  子岡　　小街的轉角處瞧不見高樓的飯莊，却南北對照着三四家小飯鋪，全是土地的店堂，辯不出什麼顏色的板凳板桌，到冬天也沒有火爐，好在有煤灶代替着給客人們取暖，在這裏，雇客有監督夥計作飯的自由，時常可以：　　「喂，老主顧了，還那麼烙得有低薄？」　　「不要吝惜油啊！」　　在晌午，這些門口擠滿了洋車和擔子，洋車上是空的，在屋子裏大嚼的人不是坐車的，却是車的主人——用五六十枚賃它一天的主人，各自記得淸自己的車形，决不會有錯兒，只消在伏案屈眼啃窩頭吞灰麵時略略帶上一隻眼睛便行了，防備有歹心眼兒的拖了別人的溜之大吉。　　間或也有自行車靠在鬥旁，那是報販或者店鋪裏的跑街小夥計，大家會對他多啾幾眼，洋車夫們嘆氣：　　「害人的東西，摔了咱們多少飯碗？」　　「俺有一次追過一輛，却也不差離兒哩，他媽的爺罕！」但眼紅的也有：　　「如我年輕，我也會學它一學，當個送信的多賺錢？」　　另外一撮人，是小販。　　賣自菜的大車也歇在外面，如果掌櫃願意，便拿幾棵換一頓午餐。多的是扁擔挑子，鷄蛋挑蘿卜挑以及舊貨挑，這些一模一樣的挑子只有它們的主人才認得淸自己的家當。在座中談着今天的最高賣價和最低賣價，如果贏餘，不壞便笑吟吟地來三兩高粱，這是令同伙們嘖嘖稱羨的，不過，這種情形不常有。多少個厚實的心還記着家裏的幾張嘴，摸着豐滿的錢囊，便似乎對得住妻兒們以的心慰了。　　收舊貨的時常會借這機會來炫耀自己的收獲，譬如：一件短棉襖，一隻小坑桌，一盞舊油燈……把自己的收進價錢提高一點，然後向着這羣火熱的眼睛：　　「誰要貿，我肯照原價，便宜的哪！」　　「咱兄弟有義氣，哥兒們要買我是情願貼本的！」即使不是眞話，但帶着溫情的話會把買客抓牢的。　　偶然也有成交的時候。　　街口的巡警也有到道裏來吃飯的，夥計們和悅地招呼着像認乾爹一樣，忙着把有着警徽的帽子掛在牆上。但在這裏的「先生們」却摘去了橫肉臉，滿意着那點奉承，和掌概談爺天．車夫們也忘了他的警棍而敢搭訕兒了。　　人在這裏，全成了伙伴，沒有什麼虛假。賬目也是各算各的，哥兒們兩不打擾。　　一直到午後太陽偏斜的時候人才稀疏起來，「內有雅座」的幌子在門外飄蕩。狗  陳福熙　　我憎惡狗。　　乾娘家裏養了隻果洋種的獅子狗。我每回去，每回看見牠；但一看見，常常使我追溯那被忘掉在記憶中的阿銀。　　我眞討厭狗。狗好像是我的仇敵，看見狗，一種怨恨的敵愾，便不期然的呈現到我的心頭。雖然我憎恨，但會有一隻母狗，是我時時認爲可憐的，那便造阿銀。阿銀在我的記憶裏，總是那麼溫柔，馴良，和一身白色的毛。牠是雌性，每到冬天，就有一次生產。屋　下，漆黑的街堂裏，舖幾根稻草，或是半張破爛的蘆爺，便是牠做產的處所了。每次生產，多則七八頭，至少也有三頭；可是牠每次產下的狗，從不見牠好好養大，那些狗，往往在產後一個月就被人捕去。牠看不見自己的孩子，於是整天憂鬱地在街上走，從東邊走到西邊，看見陌生人，發着兇狠的嘷叫。　　牠悲傷，失掉了孩子…　　小狗睡在娘的懷裏，有花白的，有全黑的，有黃的，也有白的；有睡着的，有吮乳的，又有「嗚嗚」地呌的，煞是好看。記得一年，阿銀正在我家的衖常裏做產，我早晚進出這衡堂，總向狗窩裏去張望，看看小狗會不會爬，有沒有開了眼睛？但一天，當我照例去看狗窩時，忽然發現所有的小狗都沒有了。狗窩裏只是骯髒，空洞，一點沒有聲音。　　「呀！小狗到那兒去哪」？　　我驚異。無邪的童心，彷彿感到失了友伴似的悲哀。跑以街堂，離我家不遠，我頓見阿銀，惛惛然，走着那麼慢慢的脚步。牠那憂惙的，傷惸的形態，更使我想到那些小狗的命運。是的，像那麼小，速走路也不會，怎麼可以離開母親呢？而且牠們睡慣在娘的懷裏，吮着圓大的乳頭，是那樣溫暖，甜蜜，幸福。現在離開了狗窩，究竟如何過活？　　我發楞。　　「阿銀養的狗統被捉去了」！我説。　　「牠們還不是要吸乳嗎」？　　「是呀！眼睛還是剛開了不久……　　「罪過！罪過！」母親也很傷感。　　於是，只要我走在路上，我總會碰見阿銀，牠拖着重大的，飽滿的乳房，慢慢地，慢慢地走。那樣子，不像產前那麼愉快，却變得非常頽唐了。　　牠明知道生下的孩子不能養大，也知道做一次產挨一次苦痛；但牠每到十月前後，總會分娩的，而且每次生產時，總希望自己的孩子養得大大的，胖胖的，能够走，能够看家，能够覓食，然而牠的希望只有幻滅。當阿銀的小狗失踪後三天，我偶然在關帝廟旁發現一隻死了的小狗，那小狗的胎毛和樣子，一看便知道：—那是阿銀的孩子。　　「咳！一個小生命完了……　　那也許遭到同樣命運的另外幾隻，同時又浮上我的腦海來了。我走着，快走近自己的家門，我却碰見阿銀；只見牠悒鬱地，走着遲鈍的脚步，向那寂寞的狗窩走去。——戰爭雜記（一）  德永直作　葉蔭譯　　（一）　　那時候，我只有七歲，自然不會明瞭：日俄戰爭是由於怎樣的理由。，也不會明瞭：是由於俄對日曾加以怎樣的壓迫和凌辱，竟弄得日本政府要那樣地使國民奮起，目不惜讓幾萬同胞的屍身曝露於滿洲草原上。　　「俄國鬼很壞，紅鬍子很壞。」　　只是因爲村長和在鄉軍人分會的會長都用這樣的話來使得村民，尤其是年輕人奮起，使得大家都這樣地說；所以，就弄到連我們這些小孩子，也用那捲不過來的舌頭嚷着：　　「俄國鬼的紅鬍子，克魯巴特金。」　　「什麼鳥，你這俄國鬼……」——結果，竟至變成了只要這麼一說就可以把對方充分侮辱的駡人話之一。　　這是某一天的事情。　　天氣並不壞；但在兩三日中間，我的父親却現出不痛快的氣色，不去做事，只是在附近的親戚家裏跑來跑去（父親是給人家做短工的，他沒有任何一個熟練的職業）。這天，他跟姑丈，外祖父等等兩三個人，在家裏的狹小的門框近旁，開始喝起酒來了。母親依舊穿戴着那離齪的服飾，鼻子裏發出咕咕的聲音，在斟酒。　　那樣的光景，對於我，完全是破天荒的。父親平常沒有喝過酒，更何况還有母親在斟酒。的確，這種情形，全然是從來沒有看見過的。　　我茫然地坐在板門口看着他們，不曉得怎麼的，外祖父就用那很多皺摺的手兒握着我的，把我拉到門框邊的父親那兒去。於是和我一塊兒玩着的妹妹也現出一付哭相，跟着我走。　　這麼着，父親就現出跟平常的臉孔十分不相同氣色，摸着我的頭兒，想要說什麼話；但我沒有聽到。　　「爸爸要去打仗了，老老實實的玩要——喏，曉得吧？……」　　外祖父從旁這樣說着，教我點頭。我明白了：「父氣是去討伐俄國鬼。」我的心裏一點也沒有生起那跟父親分離的悲哀。只是因爲父親巳然沒有拿着劍，也沒有拿着槍，總覺得有點不够味。　　過了兩三天，父親不在家裏頭了。大概是在我們還睏着覺的一早或是在夜裏，就去打仗了的。　　「媽媽，打仗的地方在那一邊？」　　夜裏，母親躺在正中：睡下來之後，那比我大兩歲的姐姐曾經這樣地問過母親。自從父親出門之後，母親因爲恐怕過於耗費燈油，所以一做完夜晚的活，馬上就鎖門，舖牀。頂小的弟弟是給母親抱着的，其次就是妹妹，跟妹妹相隣的是姐姐，我就在母親的背後。　　「戰爭是在很遠的那邊，叫做滿洲的地方！」　　可是，滿洲是在我們的房屋的西邊，還是東邊呢？那就似乎連母親也不知道。　　「是在那一邊？還是這一邊？「當姐姐指着問的時候，母親也不能够作確定的答覆。　　母親是個剛毅的女人。領着四個孩子，日子雖然過得很苦，但還不至於斷烟火。翰林進士都是不通的寶員（三）  曹聚仁　　前人之掇取科名，偶或有幾個特出的人才，記憶力較強，能背誦四子書及一二種經書，能做得成幾篇時文，幾首試帖詩，已經十二分了不得；其餘一夥熱中人物，大都依靠「通關節」，「夾帶」，「搶替」等取巧方法而來，我曾在蘇州買到一塊尺半長方的紡細手帕，上面寫滿蟻般大大字跡的時文，差不多有六七萬字：爲了功名，要做這樣麻煩的夾帶，其笨可知。其他夾帶工具，如寸方的五經四書，如大題文府，如小題文府，如經策通纂，我看了爲之短氣。從前以這樣不正當的偷巧方法獵取功名，到了現在，還有臉向靑年驕傲，自以爲通經能文，未免「顏之厚矣」！　　前人獵得功名以後，便已走上做官的楷梯，大則爲貪官污吏，小則爲土豪劣紳，把聖經賢傳丟在腦後，給牠一個不理不睬，本不必談什麼學問了。偶或有一二有心人，要研究一點學問，做點名山事業，如李慈銘之博學，張季直之能文，眞是鳳毛麟角；與科甲本身全無關係。章太炎以一代大師，貫串諸子，自成一家言，他却是一個白衣書生。他的因明學，在獄中研究所得，也非從聖經賢傳得來。他的文章，輿隸韓柳，直入魏晋堂奧，也非從讀古文而來。若說語文程度和讀經復古會有什麼連鎖關係，我眞百思不得其解！　　我在大中各學校擔任語文教課，十有餘年，和靑年接近得最久：靑年的語文程度，我最明白：一個小學畢業生的語文程度遠在貢生舉人以上，中等畢業生的寫作能力比翰林進士高明得多。我的結論是這樣：　　「翰林，進士都是不通的寳貝，凡是主張讀五經讀古文的，必是他自己讀不懂經書，看不懂古文的綠故！」（完）批評家的鏡子　　哈哈：你的鼻子是黑的！</p>

<p>「學生國貨年」中希望於女學生者  肖白　　「學生國貨年」序幕的啟露，忽忽地又是兩個月了，我們企望着國貨的進行，自然非常熱烈。同時，鑒於過去的失敗，加深未來的認識，對於本年度所有的任務和使命，自更懷着謹愼的態度，抱埋頭苦幹的精神，一步一步地向前邁進着。　　今年是大衆共知的學生國貨年，在他的理論和實踐上，都確定了國貨運動的中心，是要以學生為出發點，而全國大衆共同去推進，可是，在這裏，前天報上我又看到一份香水脂粉進口七萬餘元的消息·因此，　我陡起了一個新的感覺，覺得學生本有男女之分，在本年度中，我們的女學生們，實尤應負起極大的責任來，因為她們都是未來家庭的中饋，候補的主婦的她們的風氣，習慣，對於國貨前途的影響，實是較任何人為更重要。　　我們知道，女學生的素為社會重視，在許多塲合上，常為風氣的先導者，這是可以過去事實的表現，十分肯定證明的，往前一切新異的裝束，不大半都從女學生的身上，而推行模仿到整個婦女界嗎？所以「繫鈴解鈴」，女學生們在這個時候，若能以身作則，切實服用國貨，那末，事半功倍，自可預料，並且，她們在學生時代，倘可建築起一層提倡國產的念頭，將來脫離學校生活後，在社會，在家庭，都能隨時宣傳，而終身不忘的。　　最後，我還可以舉出一個例子來講，在最近，社會上一般婦女不是盛行着穿靑布旗袍嗎？這據我曉得，就是由女學生肇始的，現在竟可普遍到鄉村任何一個角落，因為價錢巧，是國貨，又樸素，那是十分値得提倡的，我很熱烈的希望，全國女學生們，就只要以這樣的精神，向國貨前途努力，使整個婦女界的覺醒，為學生國貨年，—也是婦女國貨年的第一年，生一異彩。服用國貨的決心就是救國武器  顏波光　　顏習齋的語錄上說：「庸人苦無氣，氣能生志；學者患無志，志能生氣；志氣環相生。」現代我們的中國民衆，不論做什麽事情，都犯了一個共同的謬點，那便是沒有服用國貸的决心。宣傳的時候，什麽跳舞不忘救國，議書不忘救國……鬧喊得鎭天價響，結果，便是閴焉無聞！凡是一件事，我們祇管吶喊，不重實做，於是結果便沒有良好的成績表現出來。眞是一樁使人十分慨歡的事情！看到過去的「五九」「五卅」不是和最近的「九一八」「一二八」同樣給了我們一個深深的創痛嗎？到現在所定的過去的「國貨年」和「婦女國貨年，」徒然的給了我們一個已往的歷史上的陳跡吧？可是「往者已矣，來者可追。」我很希望在今年的「學生國貨年」之中，大家能免掉這個錯誤，新生一些志氣，來多做實際的工作，少做宣傳的事情，因為要使提倡國貨收穫實效，必須要脚踏實地埋頭苦幹，更要人人能「以身作則」羣策羣力纔是道理。　　今年希望全國的大中小學生，個個努力提倡國貨，並且領導民衆走上愛國的道路！大衆一心服用國貨，這就是救國武器，可以挽救垂危的中國。中國工廠的倒閉，失業工人的驟增，工人及其家屬的凍餓，都是帝國主義者剝削我們的結果，我們假使要來抵抗帝國主義者的剝削只有拿服用國貨的決心來做武器信不信由你  肖白　　—痛心的片斷　　我們天天生活中所必需的「米」和「糖」，據說現在也大都在仰給舶來，海關入超册上巨大的數字，這都成了主要的進口品，而新喪我們最後的元氣。　　去年兒童玩具的輸入，聞共為一百餘萬元，而一般喪心病狂的人們，竟還會哼出「娛樂不忘救國」的論調來。　　英人在華捲烟廠的投資，和我們自己經營的資本額，為二十與一之比，香港外人所開的啤酒廠，共有七爿，華人創辦的只有烟台一家　　婦女國貨吶喊的結果，是大量的香水脂粉進口，學生國貨聲中的洋貨文具問題，我親見許多摩登（？）學生，正在他們西裝的胸前，插好了一九三五式的派克，康克令——高貴的舶來自來水筆。　　沿滬寗綫的一個大鎭裏，會買不到一塊國貸肥皂，國貨運輸到零南，貴州去，要繞道他國，這並不是夢囈。一週間國貨界新訊　　學生國貸年推行聯合委員會學生委員會，於十一日舉行討論會，議决徵求會員辦法，以徵求會員三十萬人為最低目的。　　南洋僑胞呈請僑務委員會，迅卽設法貨輪自駛，以輕國貨運費。　　濟南中國國貨公司業已成立，四月一日開幕。　　上海地方協會十一日函復工商業救濟會，决定實施救濟方案，由政府銀錢業辦理工商信用小惜欵。　　徐伯鋆君發明人造汽油，已試騐成功。　　國際貿易局息，美國某進口商需要我國肉桂，瑞典商願推銷我國印在人造絲織品及棉織品等，有意者可向該局接洽。　　實業部咨各省市，靑島血淸製造所所製國貸牛痘苗，出品在卽，望儘量購用　　雲南國貨展覽會，於本月十二日開幕。　　國際貿易局將召集本市實業界，討論國貨向南洋推銷方法。聽了吳稚暉先生講「土布運動目的」後的感想  筱石　　最近吳稚暉先生在南京市黨部演講土布運動，他有這樣的幾句驚惕語：「土布運動，宴為關係中國生死存亡之運動，宴為今日中國大多數人之大問題」。他還說：「吾人為救濟農村經濟起見，亟應提倡服用土布，俾農村人民，得有織布之機會，而享受服用售餘土布之利益」。這幾句話，眞使我們居住農村的人們，聽了感奮而至下淚。農村破產到這樣地步，誰也不能諱言，所幸農作之暇，還有紡織女工，藉以補助。不料近年以來，洋布暢銷，士布幾無人顧問，試看路上的行人，除一般農人還是土頭土腦全身穿起土布外，簡直再找不到穿用土布的同志，尤其是現在的學生們，不是花花綠綠的絲織品，便是形形色色的毛織物，怎會還有一些土布的痕跡呢？　　土布確是農村中主要副業，農婦幫助農作外，一年中至少有五個月的光陰，從事于紡織工作，每人每日可獲得一二角之工資，一個人的生活，儘可維持。年來因為銷路斷絕，農家紡紗織布的聲音，早已不易聽到，而農民的生計，因以愈感困難。造成這種現象，遠因固由帝國主義經濟的壓迫，近因則在國人不知愛用土布。在這提倡國貨聲浪熱烈中間，倘能全國上下，一致愛用土布，不但嘴裏講，還要身上穿，不但勸人用，還要自己先用，能如是，不僅可以减少資金外溢，還可救濟一萬萬六千萬農村婦女的生活。誠如吳老先生所說：「吾人當知農村破產，吾人寔有切膚之痛，如再不設法救濟，恐不久將來，吾人將無以為生」。愛國的學生呀！看了這幾句話，將作何感想！　　今年不是學生國貨年嗎？倘使全國的學生們，大家服用土布，以每人平均購置土布四元計，卽全國學生界，一年中可銷售土布價値三千萬元以上。學生如此，其他各界，繼起服用，那農村生計，就可頓呈蓬勃氣象了。吳先生也曾吿訴我們：「土布運動之目的，卽在使一般失業之農工，獲得工作之機會，而能維持其生計」。各地學生，都來自田間，你的家中，你的鄉中，有許多可愛的土布正等着學生們來服用，故學生而服用土布，不但省費耐用，受人愛敬，並且還可達到你們平日高唱「愛家愛鄉」的一句口號。　　怎樣推銷土布呢？吳先生有這樣的一個辦法提出：「希望國貨公司，以後能販賣土布」。現在上海和各地有不少的國貨公司，倘能家家另闢土布一部，專收內地各種土布，以供顧客的選擇，並于無線眾播音，盡力提倡，引起都市中人民喜用土布的觀念，行見衛文公「大布之衣」的美德，可復見于今日。　　最後吾還有一句話要鄭重的吿訴讀者，這土布的土字，千萬要認淸，凡用人工，用本國棉絲織成的，方得稱為土布。倘用機器，或外國原料織成的，雖其出品地點在國內，不得冒稱土布。吾記得邰爽秋先生主張用自紡自織的布，方得稱為土布，他的理由，當然使人欽佩，可是用本國紗廠裏出品的棉紗來織布，吾想不能不算他是土布。因為現在內地能紡紗的女子，一天少一天，倘然完全要用自紡的紗，不但人工太費，並且事實也不易做到。可惜鄉下人向稱機紗為洋紗，習慣已久，連本國紗廠裏的出品，也稱他為洋紗。吾想這一點雖沒有大關係，最好要矯正他，或稱「棉紗」，或稱「國紗」，以免誤會。貢獻話他山之石  仰葊　　胥君仰南自日本參觀工廠歸，盛道彼邦工業之合理化，而歸功於政府與同業統制力景之偉大。蓋某業生產量與某廠生產數，均有確切之規定，乃至成本估計，貨價規定，分銷地段，均須以政府與同業之力量，予以規畫，隨時有縝密之考查與指示，以故同業間無傾軋，生產量與消費量，得以適合，以視我國同業中跌價競爭，漫無限制，某種貨品之生產量供過於求，無法銷售者，其盈虧消長自然不可以道里計矣。　　胥君又謂日本學生之愛用國貨，已成一致之習慣，大中小學生，所衣，所食，所用，雖小之一線，一針，一紙，一筆，無不惟日本貨是用，近來大學生更提倡節儉，於服用國貨外，復思節省之道。破衣破帽，舊紙舊筆舊箋封，尤所樂用。我國今年公定為學生國貨年，我願我國之大中小學生，人人惟中國貨是用，且用而思所以撙節之道，則國貨之推行自速，而白銀恐慌以及工商市面之不景氣，亦可解决矣。</p>

<p>春秋點滴  （田舍翁）　　一個人要在社會上吃飯，要備兩種本領，（一）處世常識：（二）處世藝術。否則，你老人家雖然孔老二轉世，釋迦牟尼投胎，也是沒飯吃的。　　學問道德，是處世常識嗎？不是；本領技能，是處世藝術嗎？不是！聖哲的嘉言懿行，並不是處世的常識。學成的書算知識，也並不是處世的藝術。在下當了二三年的教習，所以極力反對子弟入學讀書，死學問那裏可以找飯吃呢！　　「識相」是處世的常識：同時，也是吃飯的元索。吹牛，拍馬，狡詐，是處世的藝術，同時，也是吃飯的元素。因為不懂處世常識跟藝術的人多，所以要鬧失業，沒飯吃的恐慌了！說仿「日仿」連史紙  枕綠　　不用說大家知道的：「東施效顰」咧，「沐猴而冠」咧，「依樣畫葫蘆」咧，這都是取嘲看人學樣的妙喻。仿效，又站在很中聽的創作二字的相反地位，無怪一律地受人的輕視——認為是一種不肯的行為。　　可是，事情也得瞧着辦呢！譬如製造偽幣，仿胃名家書畫，和效尤一切壞樣等情，原是不足為訓；你若學步奮發的事行，摹造優良的器物，爭長競勝，便是求之不得，仿效但恐不像了！　　我國人素稱缺乏創作力，並也不會仿效的：譬如仿造那行銷在我國市塲的洋貨，實行抵制和自衛。別國人呢，不獨能創　種種貨物出來供給我們使用，也還仿製我國固有的東西來傾滅相代。這麼相形之下，我們那裏有生存的餘地？　　這裏，我居然找到一綫國貨前途的曙光，關於互相仿效。　　我國舊產連史紙，質地細潤，潔白歷久不變，可稱佳品。日本人仿製出一種所謂東洋連史，身骨厚重和纖維均勻是它的優點，因用機器製造，可賣相去很低的價錢，幾乎佔奪了本（就是本國）連史的地位。國人有鑒於此，起初有江南製紙公司仿照東洋連史造紙，政名為汪南連史，或稱改良連史，纔得和日貨並行市上，雖然那原料不能不採用日產的木漿。後來我國有多家製行同樣的出品，殺减掉東洋連史的勢力不少。現近有一家紙廠用國產竹漿仿造，紙質竟比木漿所製更細，並能不變色，和本連史相差不多，很能受識貨的人們歡迎。但願從事國貨的人們，都有這種和外貨競勝的精神便得了！　　你仿效我，我還仿效你，祇要善於仿效，有什麽仿效不得呢？春之晨  朱瘦桐　　飽受了那隆冬的天氣，寒風冷雨不住地吹殘，四野的草原已由焦黃而變成灰黑的顏色，一片荒蕪，像死一般的寂寞；有誰能料到，和煦的春風，吹拂了幾天，便把它蘇醒了轉來，漸漸地透出一些萌芽，嫩綠的色彩，東一塊西一塊的呈現在我們眼前，覺得可愛的春，又降臨人間了。　　早晨的陽光，也睡眼惺忪似的，懶懶地掛在樹梢？絕不令人刺目，彷彿在枝幹上塗看一重金粉。飛集在樹叢中的許多不知名稱的烏雀，恐也乘此人跡稀少的當兒吧，大家往來跳躍，任意唱出自己的歡喜，道路上疾駛着的怪物，嗚的一聲，驚嚇得它們四散。可憐的鳥兒，在這文明日進的年頭，已沒有它們祖先的悠閒快樂，要隨處提防着危險的襲擊，同我們人類視馬路如虎口的心理一樣。　　淸澈得幾乎見底的池塘裏，幾頭雪白的鵝，劃動着胭紅色的脚掌，緩緩地浮去，見了陌生人，好像怕懼而故意鎭靜地離開這邊的岸頭。它那潔净得可愛，怪不得王羲之願意寫部佛經來調換了。夫子廟巡禮  乃令　　位於秦淮河畔的夫子廟，現在已改為圖書館了。在圖書館的左右兩邊，和後邊，卽所謂國貨市塲者，它的形態也並沒有和上海的城隍廟兩樣，就是廣州的城隍廟，也可說跟它不相上下。而夫子廟所以會如此聞名的緣故，大槪是因為它傍着秦淮河吧？　　從夫子廟的右廊走進去，第一映入眼簾的，便是一些鞋攤子，雜貨攤子，舊書攤子，古玩攤子，和占相攤子。再走到右廊的末尾，有着二個說書攤子，看起來是這些說書攤子的生意最興隆了，一圍的聽衆，使得這一隅的走道「水洩不　」。　　從右廊穿過了後廊，又看見了賣藥攤子，照相攤子。到了左廊時，由右邊傳來一片抑揚頓挫的歌音，我擠開了人羣，才瞧見一個穿着平庸的婦人，全臉漲着紅暈，拉尖着喉嚨，手舞足蹈地唱着，老實說，像伊這樣優美的歌喉，我是有生以來第一次聽到過過。這個發見，使我悟覺到夫子廟實在有其聞名的原因在着。　　　離開了歌攤，經過了許多零食攤子，如：賣豆腐的，牛肉的，麵餃鍋貼的，和許許多多的占相攤子。　　從夫子廟的左廊穿了出來，留在腦里的，是一幅中國老式市塲，舊型人物，生活，集會的零碎的印象。幽默對話  （影呆）　　遲到　　敎師：你為何遲到？　　學生：一個人在路上失掉了六個小銀幣。　　敎師：那末為何要使你遲到呢？　　學生：我把這六個銀幣放在鞋子裏，路走不快了。　　到這裏來為什麽？　　伊：假如我走到那黑暗的角子裏，你能罰個哲，不來擁抱我嗎？　　他：自然！　　伊：不和我接吻嗎？　　他：自然！　　伊：那麽你要我到這裏來為什麽呢？小食譜棲谿嘉果錄  放庵　　塘棲夙以出產水果得名，春夏之交，若櫻桃枇杷楊梅桃梅杏李瓜藕等，其味津津，足快朶頤，久巳膾炙人口。余亦嗜果成癖，酒後飯餘，每念念不忘焉，其卓卓可稱者，計凡有三，因分記之。　　甘蔗　棲溪之產枝幹短於嶺南，而味則淸甜不膩，着齒脆而愛嫩，亦似勝於嶺南所產，種有二，為紫皮靑皮，紫皮僅供獻神喜慶餽遺之用味澀不足道，靑皮亦有二種，為上河靑鎭江靑，前者，肥短而後者修長，據余所好，鎭江靑不及上河靑之味遠甚，蓋鎭江靑汁少而味淡也。大量皆產於棲溪之南，秋八九月即上市，而於冬令應市者最佳，良以經過窖藏，珠始雋永。甘蔗滋長時，田畝間一望如靑箭排立，恍若北方之靑紗帳也。蔗愈老愈甜，惜多節，不耐於咀嚼，設於銀七細細剖成小段，盛於磁盆，偶於枕上夢回，摸索嚼之，凉沁心肺。　　蜜橘　近人語橘，類喜暹邏等來路之貨，國內所產，黃岩橘已不為人重然塘棲之橘，味至淸冽，橘亦號金錢，小逾於恒，未採之時，望樹頭纍纍若黃金。九十月間，盈筐滿市，藏之得法，可過淸明。藏時置之　中，護於櫳糠　先慈在日，不但得過淸明，即立夏時亦嘗寄貽遠戚，人都詫為異數，蓋藏後不宜屢屢探取，而藏時尤宜輕輕存放，不損橘皮。棲溪蜜橘味略帶酸，一經剝食，齒頰間所留淸香，久久不去。惜前年冬雪時降，天氣嚴寒，橘樹大半凍死，故及時應市，巳寥落如晨星。價亦特昂，即昂亦不易購置。新種之橘樹，以有一橋白頭一之諺，滋長甚慢，恐二十二年內，不能供大嚼矣。　　荸薺　荸薺以紅花者為最佳，皮色鮮紅晶明，汁作乳白色。且耐久藏置，然須護於泥，若輕洗濯，便易腐爛，第使之風乾，尤為香甜，棲地產量甚夥，價廉而物美，然運輸於外，值乃倍蓰。前居杭市，距棲溪僅四十五里，以鄉間五六枚銅子即可購得斤許之荸薺，杭市便須三角餘一斤聞來自北國者云。哈爾濱，齊齊哈爾之間，亦有荸薺出售，每屆冬令，各水菓店擬麗車行市，上張布織，大書「南薺已到」字樣，以為號召。是其行銷之廣，可見一斑。小西天  張恨水著　　第十回　唐突女朗前露財選色凱覦墻隙裏為病傷廉　　賈多才連連的向他搖着手道：不·不·不·你不用坐在這裏，你可以回去了，就留你姑娘一個人在這裏。朱胡氏依然站着道：啊！就是讓他一個人在這裏嗎？賈多才笑道：你自己也說了，那有什麼要緊？一會子就讓他回家去。月英究竟比他母親聰明些，看到他母親，已有要肯的意思，就皺了眉道：我出來得久了，有些頭痛呢，先回去罷。賈老爺有什麽話說，我明日白天來說，那不是一樣嗎？他說着，站起身來，已經走到了房門口去。賈多才究不好意思拉住他不走，便笑道：那也好，有話明天說。姑娘，你不用忙着走，仔細摔了跌。月英本已搶着走到房門口了，見賈多才的態度已經和緩下來，就用不着跑，於是脚跨出門外，手扶了門框，回轉身來，因笑道：賈老爺，對不起，我今天實在有些頭痛。他說着這話的時候，露着一排雪白的牙齒，微微一笑。可是兩道柳葉眉毛，又深深的鎖着，只在他這一番態度之間，把他那委屈纏綿的意思，都暴露無遺，這呌賈多才就有二十四分的粗暴，也不能不掀動一番憐惜之意。便點點頭笑道：不忙不忙！就是後天來談，也沒有什麽關係。交朋友要談個知己知彼，那裏可以勉强的。這可把那位揑着五塊錢在手上的朱胡氏為了難，不知道是把錢放下來為是呢？還是把錢揣到身上去呢？望了賈多才，發出那不堪的淡笑。賈多才這就明白了她的意思了，向他點了兩點頭道：那幾塊錢，你就帶去罷，我也不在乎。（一五六）御香縹緲錄  淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯　　太后進了園之後，是如此的愉快，而我們呢，雖不能像伊一般的享福，但眼睛裏已不再見到那些奇形怪狀的角燈了，鼻子裏也不再聞到那股十分難受的紫丁香花的臭味了，畢境也舒適了許多。我們都極願趕快把奉天的一切忘記掉，尤其是那些年深月久的古宮中所蘊藏着的一派陰森神秘的氣息，更不是我所輕易敢回想的。　　我們回京之前，太后已很股切地在記掛着伊所蓄養着的那些春蠶了；伊一進園子，便恨不能馬上就敎這些白色的小動物吐絲作繭起來，因為伊對於這件事情倒也有不少的趣味。　　第二十四章　桑葉之奇蹟　　春蠶吐絲的時期却還早咧！但太后是一個很急性的人，伊從奉天回來後的第三天，雖然明知春蠶尙不曾吐絲，可是伊已急忙忙的要去瞧瞧伊所蓄養着的那許多白色的怪物了。它們是有指定的房屋的，就在頤和園的東端的一角上，一般也是很高大華麗的殿宇。我因為種種的原因，先前竟不曾上那邊去過，這一日隨着太后同去，還是初次光臨咧！太后知道我不很熟悉國內的情形，便告訴了我一大段關於桑葉的奇蹟。（二六七）弱小民族的恐怖</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言談相  大木　　據說，人類除了本身軀體和生存的機能外，還有一個極關重要「命運八字」，而且，從這上面，便可推定你將來有個兒女送你下棺材；那一年春天要破點財，那一年冬天要鬧點嘴舌；甚至幾歲上交進鴻運，或者還注定你犯一次重婚的必要，「妻財子祿」……詳細無遺。更而且，這許多玄妙的預測，祗消在你「尊容」上略有觀瞻，便可决斷休咎，洞悉過去未來。這種神通，不得不推崇×糊塗，×鐵嘴，賽神仙：這夥相面先生的「得天獨厚」了。　　我本來是固執得有些不近人情的人，對於諸如「乾坤」「陰陽」「八卦」之類的東西和名稱，非常鄙視，理由是有的：「早知某某何年月日要死，某某當該先期躺到墳墓裏去。」何以古今上下，未見此事？　　然而，天底下萬事萬物，尙需要多方面的去推考。河豚是毒品，怕吃死的「明哲」果然很多很多，不怕死而吃着的，豈無人哉！那麼，後者那種人必定是知道河豚的滋味是鮮美得怎樣特別了。相面亦然。我固反對相面，而相面先生仍有飯吃，仍有屋子住，仍有烟吸，何故耶？不能謂非相面一事自有其吸取一般鄉婦老朽，或半新不舊的社會層中男女的信心也。但是，亦有非宿命論者偶而亦想去「觸觸靈機」，這猶如很少數的「明哲」有時亦想嘗嘗河豚的滋味。那又當別論了。　　嘗經有一個晚上，且行且想人們必須吃飯的原理。過一堵高牆下，突然牆頭伸出一隻手來，要不是有盞電燈，準給嚇死，停步注視之下，始悉張道人新從四川峨嵋山什麽個洞兒裏來到上海，牆上貼着黃紙字條兒，大意是說懷着稀世的宏願，走遍天涯，訪識四海英雄，而每個英雄的代價，又「祗收大洋爾角」，而且「奉送手相」，我為之驚嘆者再，終望望然而去之。　　據相過面的朋友忠實地吿訴我，相面可以用兩句話來包括，一，是化錢買一頓教訓或一陣駡；二，是化錢呌他來欺騙自己，或者，是呌他來把自己歌頌一番。假使眞正那一根骨，那一粒痣，那幾根眉毛和人中長短，鼻子的大小額角的闊狹，能算定你將來「升官發財」或「討飯沒路走」能推測你將來「人丁興旺」或「絕子絕孫」的話，那麽，為父母者在生之育之的時候，責任就更大了。至於「做生意要謹愼」，「勿濫交友」，「少打牌」，「戒管閒事」…這大批的「說敎」，至少你要疑他是一位家長或法官。　　可是，相面這事業畢竟還遺留在社會上，而且居然還發現了博士頭銜的外國相面先生。我們吃了外國人家的麵包，又有外國來給我們相面，倒亦不失為一椿爽心的事？但，我國的星相家未免遜色了。思巴里  溟茫　　美麗的赤道的樂土啊！　　高高的椰樹，紅色的花葩，秋天的氣候，和健美的人兒。佛敎式的建築物點綴在綠叢中間，沒有狡獪的女郎步行在檳榔花香的小徑道上。這裏從沒有嚇人的砲火，沒有文明人的倨傲和欺騙，沒有灰白的面頰配着像紙薄般的搖搖欲墮的身軀，也沒有攪亂人心的二十世紀底物質文明的精神壓迫。　　從新加坡起程，自巴達維亞便換上汽車。一直穿過了樹叢和野徑，待巴里以迷人的景物迎接着客人，一陣心的迷醉便被感覺着了。　　巴里的女人裸着上身，把兩個健美的乳峯高高地聳起着。下面圍着五彩的「紗籠」，頭上頂着包裏物。從從容容地在野林道上緩行，那强健的臂膊不住地在空間搖擺。　　男人們閒來時便抱着鷄兒相鬥，賭下了金錢。忘記了不景氣，也忘記了荷　人的壓迫。　　巴里的舞蹈是世界有名的。這里產生着世界有名而繁多的舞女。巴里王的宮廷滿養着舞姬，世界的帝王從沒有這麽好的聲色的沈醉。　　巴里的音樂是一種特殊的音樂。金鐵的鏗鏘之聲可以從很遠的距離間便被聽到。泥土的廣埕上常常是擁擠着各色的人物，而巴里土人則戴上假面具，穿着五彩燦爛的衣裳，演着各種古傳說上的故事。女人們則從幼小的時候便學習舞蹈，把身體和四肢練成像蛇般的柔軟。可愛的巴里女人呵，那面孔是多麼柔和而迷人！　　從街上看去，無論男女老幼，那裸着的上半身都是顯示着强健的體魄。因為他們旣少身心的煩憂，而閒情的氣侯又把他們養成了肥胖。大自然使他們永吸着天地新鮮的養料，他們不像文明人般把自己摧殘。世界上有許多文明人的不治之症，却是還沒有吹到這兒來呢！　　佛敎的建築物散佈在綠林中間，放出古老的色澤。佛敎的風習在這兒流行，深入人心，在一些特定的時節便放出</p>
<p>Page 23</p>
<p>異彩。許多奇風異俗在這美麗的宇宙中間，也似乎怪有吸人的美感。　　火葬的時候，一把火放出來，遠遠看去，從林梢間散出燄烟，也怪有味兒。　　便是住在有名的肺病療養院，看這美麗的大地發出迷人的色澤，和吸着惑人的巴里泥土氣，真是會把病快快治好起來呢！　　在微雨中，雨絲從巴里樹梢上吹下來，微風在拂臉，怪有涼味。看迷茫的景物，真像在畫中呢！　　早晨或黃昏，暮靄罩住炊烟，西天掛着虹彩，樹梢和屋頂，幻成金黃色，多麼令人愛戀呵！　　不用穿多衣，也不用蓋大被。既不需使肉色蔽在太陽光外，也不會被烈陽灸成昏暈。永遠是秋天，這里永遠是秋天！　　一次去過巴里，便永遠忘個不了。如果一被人生的苦汁永遠磨折着心，被榨人的生活緊壓着腦，被文明的教訓拘束着行動，……真是常常要憶起巴里來，永遠想着巴里呢！賭棍  林豪　　失望照例地又佔據在陳福的腦中了。把一條掙扎得精疲力乏的身子，緩緩地橫出了那間藏在暗弄中的一家烟兌店；望望天，縐了縐青春逝去的額角，哀怨地歎了一聲。頺喪的垂着頭，望着那條修長的影子，一步步向啼號的歸途走去。　　「媽媽的！命運真壞透啦！」他想到剛才孤注一擲的那下子，實在自己的膽太浪了；否則至少還可以打上幾下的。但是這一下分明是活門，誰都要打；所以也怪不得很膽浪，總之還不是「命運」在尋人開玩笑？　　走到家門口，兒子的啼聲尖銳地向陳福的耳朵中鑽進，他暗地裏呌聲慚愧，一邊兒便在門上重重地捶了兩下。　　「是誰？」是妻子的問。　　「我！」　　門呀的一聲開了。陳福把沉重的脚碰的一聲跨進那很低的門檻，那悠悠的煤油燈的光芒，孩子的哭聲，都引起了他紊亂的愁絲。妻子把門帶上了；回轉了身軀，帶着些怨恨的口氣：「今天又在那裏混？」　　「管我呢？」捧了捧膝頭，兀的在三脚破床上坐下，接着便又歎了一聲氣，床子給壓出了一陣吱吱的音波。　　妻子永遠是陳福的奴隸。當然，次陳福的冒火，她終是徜着眼淚，不敢向他提出些微的反抗的。她除了怨恨自己的命苦外，還有什麼？　　可是，這次却不了。　　「哼！家裏什麼都沒有了。空皮箱；破傢伙！這日子怎樣過？你也不想想家裏的苦處，一味祇知拼命地賭，當光了東西去賭……」話沒說完，陳福已張大了一雙可怕的眼珠，放開破竹似的喉音：「媽的，老子賭你的東西？！」猛地站了起來，一個步兒，踏上去抓住了妻子手髮髻：「媽媽的，你敢再强一聲，老子便揍死你！」那種粗暴的手段，妻子實在感到可怕而又忍耐不住了：「你揍吧！」　　孩子的哭聲更凄浪了，更打動了陳福的一股無明火，把手中牽着的髮髻，用力地向前一送：「滾你媽的！」　　「碰……」妻子的頭撞在那只三脚的床沿，給撞起了盃子那麼大的一個疙瘩，她便把手捧着了蓬鬆的頭髮，號淘地哭了起來。　　但是陳福，他心中還遺留着剛才孤注一擲的情形。長長地唏噓了一聲，望了望像螢火似的煤油燈的光芒，心中猶期待着明天的肉搏了。門外漢  亦菴古渡頭的春天  許席珍　　不知從什麼時候起，暖暖的風拂過靜躺着的小溪中冰塊；於是小的水流開始悠悠地迂迴曲折地流了；軟的柳條上綴上稀疏的芽葉，飄拂着像少女的髮絲，而巧妙巧地，却把她底青春溫暖了滾動着的水流，同時也染綠了它。　　靜寂的，荒涼的，在一冬的沒落中給人們所拋棄了而又遺忘的古渡頭，跟着三月的來到，却也明朗地綴滿了青春的調子了呢。　　大自然是沒有人世間的冷暖與炎涼的啊。　　人瞧着挺旺的太陽，感傷地—不，是憂急地嘆一口氣春天了，這「青黃不接」的季節將延續到都久，與怎樣才渡得過去呢？　　最大的問題是：在這綺麗的天光下面隱在古渡頭後面的那個小村子裏的二十三份人家全斷了糧。去冬為了冷，為了其他無數的「不得已」的遭遇，大家忍着痛把僅存的幾斗榖子裝到鎮上的糧食行裏去換了現；於是，在一二個月的苦力敷衍之後，一到春上，便大家都空了。　　在一冬的嚴酷的經歷中，大地是什麼東西都難生長的；除了宿糧以外，便沒有可以充饑的東西了；但是宿糧早已化了錢，而錢也早收進了別家的倉庫了呢。　　望一望明朗的天空，相反地，人們的心緒却漸漸地在暗下來：這青黃不接的季節不知將延長到多麼久，而且，今年是又不知道將是怎樣一個年成呢？　　古渡頭是冷清清的，村裏是再不會有人趁船去趕春市了，那已經是多年以前的事。而現在是，活生生的漢子一個個地飄出去，不知死活地失落在外邊了。　　而這小村子裏是冷清清的；樹梢頭，屋檐前，與紫色的山的那邊，盤繞着的是老人底憂急，曠女底怨，與孩子們底白色的燥惱；歡懼是已經很遠很遠地走開去了。　　是怎麼一回事呢？可誰都有點糊塗。　　（渡頭的柳枝又一次地給三月的風吹亂了，一些嫩葉子零落地飄到溪水面上；小溪上浮着一座破殘的小筏子人用竹竿打着它到處摸小魚及螺蚌。看着深綠色的水，輕輕地縐了「城裏米店裏又漲起價來了！」）　　然而大自然是公平而也是殘酷的，他可不懂得人間的諸相；於是，當飢餓的鐵掌扼住了這古意的小村子的時候，外面的天地却依然張起了春天的雜色的錦幕；風是暖的，柳枝是柔軟而長，花像發了狂一般地長成，野草用了年青的激進繁滋起來，世界是火一般地蓬勃着呢。　　一些人便開始迷惘起來了：那麼着，便連古渡頭的幽靜都給破壞了，不斷的憂傷的臉在四處散佈着；他們，忽略了那柳絲的柔意，忽略了小山的青紫，也忽略了詩人的對自然之追慕的神經，而把一些不快意的意象撒在黏濕的泥地上了。　　人從嫻靜的古渡頭散步回來，印象是生硬的：「古渡頭的春天是已經失掉了她底嬌媚的外套了。」　　是的，因為時代是已經越過了中世紀的優閑的情調而瘋狂地奔向前去了啊。　　便讓風吹拂着柳枝，讓詩人去神往吟哦吧，古渡頭的春天是已經跨進了另外的一個時代了。自我職業介紹　　某君，原籍廣東，生長上海，向營商業，精通各地方言，現願就機關公司商店或個人交際招待傳話之職，薪水從廉，如需是項人才者請函致上海城內福佑路三二八號蔡炎收。　　某君，江蘇籍，年二十四歲，中學程度，熟悉帳目並校對抄寫油印，現願任上項職業，待遇不計，並備有殷實舖保，通訊處梵王渡中山路二六三七號轉。業餘信箱未見面怎好通信呢編者先生：　　一個人達到相當的年齡以後，婚姻問題就會接踵而至。雖在本人並不覺得怎樣需要，但環境却逼着本人來進行這件事。　　像我在近幾年來的生活，似乎完全是陷於困苦當中，對於婚姻我是不敢去妄想了：因為我還沒有擔負家庭生活的力量，那裏敢結婚呢？於是我決定了我理想的對象；（一）有謀生能力；（二）樸實無華。那種以「結婚為女人的出路」或是趨向享樂的女子，當然沒有和我結合的可能。　　從前，家庭為了我的婚事，也常常討論到，並且還提出幾個對象來，可是並沒有什麼結果。原因是自己認為時期未到，而且那些女子，都和我的理想相左故作罷論。　　是這樣，我有一個很知己的朋友王君寫信給我，說有女友陳女士，有了中學程度，頗具姿色為人也不差……願着我撮合。接着，他又來信，呌我寫信給那陳女士，我想置之不理吧，似乎是辜負了他的熱心，但是呌我寫信，我却又有點疑慮不決；　　（一）我和她從未謀面，這位女士的一切我沒有一點認識？　　（二）我很嗜好文學，不知她的志向如何？　　（三）我還在讀書，可以說是在消費時期：出校後的職業，也沒有把握。假使這位女士深印着「結婚是女人的出路」的觀念的話，我怎樣擔負得起呢？　　（四）她的家庭狀況如何？是否腐敗？　　因為發生了上列的問題，我就不想寫信給她，但是昨天我的朋友却又有信來了，呌我怎樣應付呢？實在為難極了！先生你是大衆的導師，對於我這個問題，肯給我一個明確的指示嗎？敬請撰安　培森上　　編者按：培森君對於婚姻問題的慎重考慮，這是很應該的。　　他說他的理想中的對象是有謀生能力和樸實無華，這當然是很重要的；但有一點，他似乎沒有顧慮到；就是那未來的對象性情和思想的問題。我們知道一個女子有了謀生能力，可以減輕你的家庭的負擔，但假使她的性情不和你相適合，那末也不是家庭的幸福啊。我們覺得性情和思想實在是一般青年男女在結婚以前所應慎重考慮的一件大事。　　至於培森君現在所遭遇的情形，並不是什麼難題。因為關於她的性情，學識，思想和家庭的狀況，在你們通信或見面後，你一定可以知道的。所以你現在可以先要求王君介紹你和陳女士會面（未會面以前似乎沒有冒昧通信的必要。）在會面後，可細細的觀察她的一切行為。以及她對於你的態度，在後再決定你的宗旨。假使雙方有什麼不適合的地方，那末就不必談到婚姻問題了。這樣對於你並沒有什麼損失的。同時，我們要知道；「交友」和「婚姻」完全是兩件事，男女交友不一定就要聯繋到「婚姻」上去啊！無綫電播音節目歌唱　　大上海社　　大中華（一一六〇）下午六時至七時　　寒衣曲（王琪）永別了弟弟（玲玲）娘子軍歌（落葉）我不能忘記你（王琪）再見吧故鄉（玲玲）市上山歌（落葉）畢業歌（全體）　　飛音社　　華興（一二六〇）下午六時至七時　　連環扣（樂隊）娥眉月（俞月明）銀漢雙星（曼娜）愛的花（露茜）飛花歌（佈德）船夫曲（小賈寂君曼娜）新女性（俞月明）夜深深（曼娜）賣花姑娘（露茜）滿江紅（佈德）　　星光競音社　　東方（一〇二〇）下午六時十分至七時　　黃浦采江（黃喋游泳）鳳陽鼓（胡瑛）小小茉莉（競芳）月下花前（游泳）求愛秘訣（黃喋）花弄影（胡瑛）　　富星（九二〇）下午七時半至八時一刻　　摩登戀愛（胡瑛）夜戰場（游泳）戀愛明星（黃喋）娥媚月（競芳）等一等吧（薛陶游泳）　　華光（一四八〇）下午八時半至九時一刻　　長記得（游泳）鴛鴦怨（黃喋）風雨歸舟（胡瑛）蘇武牧羊（競芳）愛向何處尋（游泳）我的愛人就是你（黃喋薛陶）　　利利（一二四〇）下午十時十分至十一時　　特別決車（黃喋）銀漢雙星（薛陶游泳）寒衣曲（胡瑛）丁香山（競芳）自殺尚未成功（黃喋）得勝凱歌歸（游泳）　　鳳鳴社　　中華（一一四〇）下午六時半至七時一刻　　南京路進行曲（前奏）窮富姻緣（琳琍）風雨歸舟（靜雅）催眠曲（白燕）嫁給勇士吧（朱琪）漂泊者（許靜聲）芭蕉葉上詩（飛虹）愛情如玫瑰（飛亞）　　上海歌劇社　　東陸（六四〇）下午六時半至七時半　　燕帶春來　鸞風和鳴　夜半的私語（黃韻）鴛鴦怨（姚莉）燕雙飛（金儀）嫁給勇士吧　去年的我（黃韻）休息五分鐘　五月花（姚莉）　　大中華（一一六〇）下午八時至九時　　風雨琴歌　人面桃花　櫊樓上的小姐（姚莉）微微風（黃韻）蝶戀花（金儀）今夜曲　蝴蝶姑娘（姚莉）愛情如玫瑰　細雨梧桐（黃韻）　　永生（一〇八〇）下午九時至十時　　Wife的ABC　不見去年人　乳娘曲（黃韻）天下為公（姚莉）擲桌兒　月下花前（黃韻）紅玫瑰　奇異酒店（姚莉）　　玫瑰團　　明遠（九六〇）下午八時至九時　　三潭印月（前奏）蘇三哪！（張如）小妹妹的心（玲玲）青春之樂（曼麗）紅燒丈夫（張如）愛的花（文仙）桃李刦（全體）花弄影（玲玲）開路先鋒（周恭）　　中西（一〇四〇）下午八時三刻至九時半　　梅花三弄（前奏）賣油條（張如）賣花女（曼麗）賣花詞（王喋）賣報歌（文仙）賣魚者（玲玲）賣飛柳（張如）　　安定（八六〇）下午十時至十一時　　寄生草（前奏）天官賜福（張如）好朋友來了（文仙玲玲）山中美人（曼麗）警鐘（王蝶）情伴（周恭張如）春朝曲（玲玲）永別了弟弟（黃六一）　　夜鶯藝社　　國華（一二〇〇）下午九時至十時　　燕雙飛（珮婷）愛的花（露茜）永別了弟弟（曼娜）我的愛人就是你（珮婷秀蒂）等一等吧（露茜流朗）大家歡樂（　蕾）夜深深（曼娜）夜月之歌（秀蒂）畢業歌（全體）彈詞　　蔣如庭朱介生落金扇　　中華（一一四〇）下午九時至九時三刻　　開篇「珍珠塔賀喜」　　暮景桑榆少後根，陳連是一場掃興出中門，乘龍選中方家姪，今日前來扮道人，難詳來跡與根情，得報門墻臨貴客，當朝司馬愛門生，崑玉同行共向內，恭喜堂前老翰林，陳公是心事重重渾渾解，略談幾句問寒溫，與中書看相說原因，一個說道恩師法眼原非眛，選中乘龍弟一名，今科夫子貴門生，一個說道話中有語休取笑，冷語冷言欺侮人，入到雲軒公細把真情說，南陽片雪救書生，冒畢顯，中頭名，及第三元放代巡妹丈賜金蓮寶炬照完姻，重逢相國門楣第，吉還方氏舊家紳，奉旨祭點到東京，聞言氣倒老年尊，不因該喬扮今朝欺侮我，一朝及第得功名，相逢還不肯露真情，我女兒永不嫁方卿，一個兒深深代揖深深叩，說年輕格外望實恩，告解一聲忙提轎，雙雙賓主話謙遜，陳公是內堂意欲說根情。　　姚小庵王萍麒麟豹　　中西（一〇四〇）下午十一時至十二時　　開篇「三般苦

<p>申報本埠增刊　電影專刊「自殺」謠諑聲中琪恩對於今世之留戀（上）  雪梅　　銀髮女郎琪恩哈羅（Jean　Harlcw）說：「如果我明天死，我所能帶到未來世界去的，當然祇有一些留戀和迴憶，但是我所留戀迴憶的是什麼呢？並不是我在今世所享的榮名，亦不是今世所積聚的金錢，亦不是一切物質上的奢侈，亦不是人們的揄揚和恭維的話，亦不是羅曼斯。我所要帶到來世去的，不過是些瑣碎的小事，一切愛我的人替我做的。惟有這些瑣碎的小事。可以溫暖我的心，使我得到無盡的安慰。」　　以上琪恩哈羅突如其來的談話，是從什麼地方來的呢？原來在這不吉利的年頭，非但在中國的上海，鬧着許多死的事件，即在影城好萊塢，誰自殺，誰遇橫禍的謠傳，亦鬧得滿城風雨。其中關於這位琪恩哈羅的死，謠言得特別厲害些。這位銀髮女郎近年來所遭遇的不幸事件，已經不一面足，但是她却挺直了腰，和惡劣的環境奮鬥着。雖然有許多人相信她是位勇敢的女子，但仍有許多人，却以為她將敵不住環境的壓迫而自殺。這就是關乎琪恩的種種謠言的出發點。但是讀了琪恩這篇談話以後，亦就可以知道哈羅女士決不至於自殺的。　　不久以前，哈羅女士應了曼琳黛維絲的召，參加她海濱別墅之宴。不想她到了那裏，遇到了一位女郎，那位女郎看見了琪恩，竟呦然一聲暈了過去。等到她醒過來之後，她告訴人家說：「當我來到黛維絲家的途中，我買了一份報，上面明明登載着琪恩哈羅遇到了意外以致慘死的紀載。我看了，心裏非常不好過，就想回家去的。後來一想，既然走了一半路，且先到這裏來休息一下子再說。不想哈羅女士從天而降，使我闖的看見了，以為遇見了琪恩的靈魂呢。」　　「這些謠言」，琪恩哈羅說，「就如同鬼物一樣，纏住了我，使我一刻不能安寗。這種空想，雖然不過係空想，但却在我腦筋之中，下了很深的根。我雖然能躍能跳的活着，但是却使我覺得我的死，確是可能的，並且是急在眉睫的。所以我就想到，如果我明天真的死了，我將帶什麼到來世去？」照着琪恩哈羅所說，她所最留戀迴戀的事，就是愛她的人所替她做的零星瑣碎的事。她曾提到過二個人是特別愛她的，一個是她的母親，一個是她的黑侍女白蘭區。　　母親的疼愛兒女，是無微不至的，是出於天性的，是凡有人心的人，都可以想象得到的，但是一個侍女對於她的主人，一個傭婦的對於女東家的愛，摯愛，却是不常見的。因此我在這裏有特別紀載的必要。　　白蘭區是五年以前，來投効於這位銀髮女郎的。她起初說，她一定要做琪恩的侍女。至於為什麼她一定要做琪恩哈羅的侍女呢，她到現在還沒有說出來。琪恩亦不再去問她，但是她說她自己明白了。以下就是琪恩哈羅關乎白蘭區的一些談話：　　關乎白蘭區的一切，我祇要講些她替我做的一切瑣碎小事，就可以知道她的為人，以及對我的忠心了。這都是些日常的小事，但是從這些小事上，就可以看得出它們背後的原動力。譬如說，我購買絲襪，向來是論打買的，但是我買了一打襪子給了白蘭區。她祇給我四五雙，其餘的她藏了起來，等我穿舊了再給我新的。為什麼呢？因為有一天，我送給我一位朋友一打襪子。從此以後，她就不將整打的襪子交給我了。她雖不說明，她却已使我知道，我的朋友並不窮，儘可以自己買襪子，用不着我送給她們，但是我生性手頭散漫，而白蘭區知道我的毛病，不再給我浪費的機會了。　　「對於我用的香水，她亦是這樣。我一次買了許多，但是白蘭區每次却祇給我二三兩。其餘的不知她藏到那裏去了。在我尚未用完之前，無論如何求她，她決不肯全部交給我的。我知道了，我亦不再求她了。」（未完）影片談評評「神秘夫人」  凌鶴　　Mystery　Woman—國泰　　假使「神秘夫人」也應當列入偵探影片一類的話，那末人們會在若干程度之下覺着滿足的。我們因然得指出這裏沒有嚴肅的現實性，而且在糾紛過於繁雜的時候，劇作者是强調了良心的理智戰勝了利慾，將愛情與良心聯在一道，作為極好的法寶，使人們覺得那是在做戲。　　關於這一點，我們所指的是將軍夫人和國際竊賊最後得着了那軍事秘密文件之後，將軍夫人為了要救丈夫，（她的丈夫是因失此文件而一褫職下獄的）她使頓起狠心，竊文件圖逃，而竊賊之最後的目的也便是欲以此文件出售巨價。這裏劇作者不使將軍夫人逃脫竊賊的巨掌，以免舊觀念的觀衆責備她的負心，同時他又不能使竊央行逍遙法外，於是便以良心與愛情來說服竊賊，當然夫人得給竊賊深深的一吻，作為知己的報答。於是竊賊死於格鬥之下，給與了人們良心的同情；那個竊賊雖然行為不端，可是他的良心却是很好的。而將軍夫人就由於這位對自己頗有愛情的少年竊賊以死的代價，使丈夫恢復自由，而且得着榮譽的獎章了。如此解決糾紛的方法，所謂良心超越一切的，我們在美國影片中是常時可以看見的，這對於舊觀念的觀衆們，是攫取感情最好的方法，但是在作為現實主義的藝術評價上，這不免是一種損失了。　　的確，這種地方，是「神秘夫人」本身最精采的表現，這無論是劇作者將這當作劇的頂點，而導演在演技的指導上，在空氣的佈置上，在攝影的光與影的安排上，都見純熟與成功。　　整個的來說，除了良心主義的强調，應當是劇的缺點之外，在全部的創作技巧上，編劇導演演員，以及攝影，都是電影藝術的將他們所要表現的東西，恰當的表現出來。譬如軍官褫職的開頭到軍官復職的結尾，這悲劇的開頭與快步的結尾，在莊嚴穆肅的空氣中，就使人覺得整潔。而且全部都很整潔，明快，這固然是劇的結構的嚴密，而導演並不以平庸的偵探片的慣用的手法來有意的賣關子，同時使劇情仍在緊湊的空氣中進行着。特別是寫竊賊和軍官夫人愛情的歡愉；雖然沒有將軍官夫人理智和愛情的糾紛或矛盾，若干程度的表現出來，可是在旅館中的種種，那歡愉的氣氳，調劑了後部的嚴肅，對於觀衆的欣賞的快感上，乃是很有效果的。　　至於演技方面，似乎我們不能指出那一個演得特別好，但是他們都很盡職。尤其是瑁娜芭莉Nona　Barrie以前僅做配角，現在却主演本片，她的演技亦有相當的進步了。千金難買的畫面　　我們在銀幕上看見一個極短的畫面，但在攝製時往往是化去許多金錢血汗和時間。以最簡單的論，拍日出，要須早早的擺好開麥拉恭候日頭的升起，拍日落，亦須早早的等待那裏，至於收獲的優劣，那還是另一問題。從前「漁光曲」攝取烏鴉歸巢一幕，記得曾費了三天的功夫纔得收入鏡頭，原因就是因為烏鴉這東西眼睛是非常的敏利，她看見有人在樹下等着牠，牠就不肯歸來，等到天黑了，不能拍了，攝影人也走了，牠纔飛到巢裏去。最後，想出了一個辦法，纔得美滿成功。這辦法像作戰一樣，用草和樹枝將開麥拉像大砲一樣的遮避起來，攝影師和導演也藏在裏面，等到烏鴉歸來時，開麥拉便搖起來了。　　攝製烏鴉歸巢既是這樣困難，如果攝取「烏鴉哺雛」那是列難的事了。最近羅明佑費穆合導的「天倫」中需要這麼一幕戲，竟把導演銜生愁得兩條眉毛都搭成了一條。但出人意外的，纔費去八天的功夫，這幕戲竟告成功了。方芸英片中胡珊唱京劇歌曲　　吉星影片公司將於本星期日（十七日）起，在金城戲院開映新片「方芸英」，為胡珊主演，有聲對白，全部並配和諧音樂，成績甚佳。劇中胡珊串演「賀后罵殿」，「麻姑獻壽」，及時新歌曲，清晰嘹亮，極為動聽。又有巨大戲院佈景，以及公園外景，配光合度，亦復悅目。其尤足稱頌者，為胡珊表情之細膩，處處能發揮其藝術之天才，更為難得可貴。預料公映之日，北京路上，必有一番盛況云。金城大戲院「油漆未乾」公演　　轟動世界法國著名喜劇「油漆未乾」，為國內劇壇先進歐陽予倩氏自歐美考察歸來後第一次偉大貢獻，並由舞台宿將應雲衛氏加入通力合作。而參加表演者，如王瑩，左明，李麗蓮，沈以偉，前轍，舒湮，舒繡文，陳翼，璐璐等，又加暨大劇社之中堅份子。故當該劇在暨大試演時，各報輿論，一致讚美。良以本劇演出效果極佳，由第一幕到第二幕，到第三幕，情緒一幕緊張一幕。觀衆哄笑之聲，震動瓦宇。即此一端，即足證實演員們的演技，確有相當之成熟。今該社為謀普遍起見，特於十五十六（星期五及星期六）兩天，在金城大戲院公演此劇云。天一銀花飛舞　　有聲新片「堅苦的奮鬥」定於十六日起在卡爾登公映。　　文逸民新作「母親」之初審脚本業已製就送審。　　劉素琴在「重歸」中客串，成績頗佳。　　「重歸」中之歌曲，「永久的青春」現已改為「美麗的青春」。　　范雪朋自「紉珠」成功後，更受一般觀衆的擁戴，每日函索照片者纍纍。　　「美人恩」，「兩兄弟」等新片，亦將次第公映。　　阮玲玉自殺，天一女星尤以陸麗霞，范雪朋哭甚哀。　　王楚琴是陸麗霞的女朋友，「重歸」中她也來串演一下，不過所飾的角色比較不重要而已。電影小說威靈登軼事（The　Iron　Duke）（八）  信之　　那家倫敦小報的駐巴黎記者，呌做貝資，是個利令智昏的小人。安諾勒公爵就利用了，他想審威靈登。她對着他道：「你藏好了那封信。你親眼看見那婦人在巴黎，和威靈登公爵坐在一起看戲。好，這不是一段很好的新聞嗎？」貝資說：「這段新聞可以使全倫敦為之震駭，亦可以使威靈登喪失了朝廷上的地位」。公爵夫人冷然道：「英國朝廷上的地位，我管不著。我所要的，就是要他離開這巴黎。這個方法不興，再用別的方法。這是給你的錢。你去好好幹吧」。巴資笑逐顏開地接過了錢，鞠著躬，退出去了。　　一個禮拜之後，威靈登坐在巴黎的府內。他面前抬着一張倫敦的仇迪記事報，上面一行大標題，寫着：「風流鉅案：威靈登公爵及威伯斯特動爵夫人：威靈登是否將被召回」？　　威靈登的面前，站着立洽蒙公爵夫人和茀蘭茜斯。公爵夫人道：「事情已經糟到這樣。我早和你說過，不要待她太好了」。威靈登問道：「待她太好？我覺得還不够好呢」。茀蘭茜斯啜泣着道：「這都是我不好。我害了我最心愛的一個人了，除去了威伯之外」。威靈登奇怪道：「威伯？威伯是誰？」公爵夫人道：「韋德爾·威伯斯特，她的丈夫，還有誰呢」。威靈登連忙答應道：「哦，當然。你一定要立即回到你丈夫那裏去，詳詳細細地將一切情形講給他聽。　　茀蘭茜斯害怕道：「講給他聽！我有些不敢」。威靈登道：「難道不敢回家嗎」？公爵夫人道：「她的丈夫是個最喜歡吃醋的人」。威靈登想了想道：「好，我有了主意了。我們將茀蘭茜斯送到我家裏去。吉蒂是最有腦筋的人。她一定會想出好主意來的。却珞蒂，你趕快打發她走，無論如何，你亦有責任的」。公爵夫人又問道：「那末那些政府官員怎樣對付呢。這段新聞給各報轉載，你不得不辭職了」。威靈登道：「當然。我當然知道這件事情的嚴重，但是我們現在且不用悲泣」。　　在威靈登公爵倫敦的住宅中，威靈登和他的夫人正坐在客廳裏。威靈登夫人手中拿着針黹，對面是威靈登公爵在喝茶。威靈登夫人戴着眼鏡，面貌藹然可親，微笑地對着她的丈夫。威靈登道：「真的嗎？她的丈夫一趟都沒有上這裏來過？她不是已經來了三天了嗎」？夫人道：「他要等你來了，才肯來哩」。威靈登道：「這種男人，真是渾蛋」！夫人又問道：「你第一次看見她，在什麼地方」？威答：「在立治蒙公爵夫人不魯塞爾府裏」。　　夫人又說道：「當然你們在巴黎的時候，是常在一起的」。威靈登道：「吉蒂，你做的茶是我惟一喜歡喝的」。夫人插嘴道：「我想騎術一定很好的」。威答：「很好，很好」。夫人放下了針黹，抬起頭來道：「比薩維爾動爵夫人還好嗎」？威道：「吉蒂，你最佩服她的騎術，是不是」？夫人說道：「我願意你住在家裏的時候多些」。威靈登道：「等我和波邦族的交涉辦好了，我就可以回到英國，住在家裏種種花草，享些安樂了」。威靈登正說着，一個僕人走了進來說道：「韋德爾威伯斯特先生拜候」。威靈登道：「請他書房裏坐」。他然後對着他的夫人道：「吃醋的丈夫來了。你去預備茀蘭茜斯。就先去對付她的男人」。（未完）</p>

<h3>Mongolian-Suiyuan Tax Dispute: Xiao Renyuan Continues Mediation</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Gui telegram 7: Regarding the Suiyuan-Mongolia tax dispute, both sides have expressed acceptance of the two measures agreed upon through Xiao Renyuan's mediation. However, when Xiao left Bailingmiao, Prince De verbally stated that the Zhang-Gan Automobile Company had been registered and protected by the Mongolian Political Council, and Suiyuan Province should not interfere. The Suiyuan side believes that the point of contention is whether the Zhang-Gan Automobile is a special vehicle transporting special goods between the Chahar and Mongolian sides, and whether the so-called protection is to evade taxes from Suiyuan Province. If the Mongolian side clarifies this matter, the Mongolian-Suiyuan problem, which has been delayed for more than ten days, can be resolved. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A visitor from Bailingmiao said that since the Military Sub-Committee sent staff officer Xiao Renyuan to mediate the Mongolian-Suiyuan tax dispute, both sides have agreed on a tax-splitting method. It is reported that the Mongolian side has expressed its recognition, and is only waiting for the Suiyuan side's recognition. However, the Suiyuan side firmly believes that this is under the jurisdiction of Suiyuan Province and cannot undermine the overall administrative unity of the central government, and that the matter is of great importance and must be reported to the central government before a decision can be made and signed. The two sides are still in dispute over the issue of setting up checkpoints to collect taxes. The Mongolian side believes that Wuliwusu, Heishazha, and Bayinshandaimiao belong to the Mongolian Autonomous Region, so the matter is still being mediated by Xiao Renyuan. In the future, the central government will have a solution, and the Mongolian Political Council will obey the central government. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>

Kong Fanying presented Minister Kong with a framed ancient stone statue of Confucius and his wife. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>New Confucian Temple and Shrine Built in Yushima, Tokyo, Japan</h3>
<p>(Jinan) The new Confucian Temple and Shrine built by the Yushima Siwen Association in Tokyo, Japan, will hold its completion ceremony on April 28th and expand the Confucius sacrificial rites. Renowned scholars from home and abroad will be invited to participate. Since this province is the hometown of Confucius, special attention will be paid to inviting one descendant each of Yan, Zeng, Si, and Meng, as well as two well-known Confucian scholars from the area to participate and provide them with travel expenses. If direct descendants do not attend, representatives can be sent. Kong Decheng will not attend, but it is hoped that he will send a personally written congratulatory message. The above was what Nishida, the Japanese consul in Jinan, told reporters. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Tenth Anniversary of the Passing of the Premier: Respectfully Informing Japanese Government and Private Personages: Important Speech by Sun Ke</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) On the 12th, Sun Ke gave an important speech to Japanese government and private personages, entitled "Respectfully Informing Japanese Government and Private Personages on the Tenth Anniversary of the Passing of the Premier." The speech has been telegraphed for broadcast by the Japanese Broadcasting Station. The speech briefly stated: Today is the tenth anniversary of the passing of the Premier of the Chinese Kuomintang. The Chinese people feel the difficulties of the country and grieve for the absence of the mentor. Every year on this day, the pain is especially deep. This year, the government and private personages of your country are holding meetings with grand ceremonies to commemorate him, recall his life, and expound his theories. This is truly the dawn of peace in East Asia and the good fortune of the future of relations between the two countries. I am especially grateful for the pure friendship of the people of your country. Recalling the winter of the 13th year of the Republic of China, a few months before the Premier passed away, he received a grand welcome from the people of your country and gave a speech on his Greater Asianism, discussing it with the people of your country with sincerity. Today, the people of both countries are reading his last teachings. How can we not have endless feelings? Recalling that before the Revolution of 1911, the Premier resided in the East and received sincere assistance and pure friendship from patriots in your country, which is enough to be immortal with the universe. Looking back on the past, how can we not have endless feelings? China and Japan are countries of the same race and culture and should coexist and prosper, love each other, and help each other. Those with knowledge have no doubt about this. Both countries were originally great powers in the East. For a hundred years, they have felt the aggression of European and American influences, which has aroused the awakening of the people of both countries, and they have risen together for a movement of vigorous self-improvement. In these fifty years, knowledgeable people in both countries know that this is a competition for the survival of the yellow race. The weak and small countries of East Asia all have the obligation to support each other, and China and Japan, as neighbors, should be especially close, so as to survive the great difficulties of the future. Moreover, the cultures of the two countries have been deeply integrated for thousands of years. From religion, philosophy, ethics, and rituals to literature, art, music, and daily life, all have the same origins. In terms of belief, such as Confucius's sacrificing oneself to achieve benevolence, Mencius's giving up one's life to uphold righteousness, Wang Yangming's unity of knowledge and action, and Yue Wu Mu's loyalty to the country, people in both countries admire them. The spirit of the Premier's Three Principles of the People originated from this, and those with knowledge in your country who sympathize and support it are also numerous. With the spiritual closeness of the people of the two countries, the relations between the two countries are often in a state of deterioration and infighting. Is this not regrettable? Recently, the governments and private personages of China and Japan have gradually begun to awaken and want to reverse the situation. The voice of improving relations between the two countries is very loud. This is a major event that those who care about peace in East Asia and world peace want to see. But how will this goal be achieved? It depends on whether the governments and private personages of both countries can truly have a long-term vision and thorough understanding. If we focus on short-term gains and act emotionally, we will be trying to catch fish by climbing a tree, and there will be little success. As I dare to assert, what is the way? I believe that we must base ourselves on the spirit of the Premier's Greater Asianism, take the Eastern virtues of loyalty, filial piety, trustworthiness, righteousness, benevolence, love, and peace as the foundation, and the modern ideals of equality, freedom, fraternity, and mutual assistance as the guide. Then, we can be sincere with each other and determine a century-long plan for the future of the two countries. How can the long-suspended Sino-Japanese problem not be solved? This is only what I hope that the people of both countries will work together for. (Central News Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>

<h3>My Opinion on the Economic Commission's Unification of National Water Conservancy</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>Since China's waterways have fallen into disrepair, drought years bring about thousands of miles of barren land, while flood years turn hundreds of millions of people into fish food. The loss of life and property is immeasurable, truly a great calamity for the people and a deep worry for the future of the country. In recent years, the government has recognized the need to pay attention to water conservancy construction. However, we still hear about water conservancy while droughts remain inevitable, and about flood control while floods cannot be prevented. This is not entirely due to the irremediable abnormality of the weather, but rather to the failure of the national water conservancy agencies to achieve their intended effectiveness. In the past, according to a survey by the Ministry of Interior in the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), there were as many as 61 water conservancy agencies nationwide, with diverse systems and inconsistent jurisdictions. Such numerous and ineffective agencies not only consume water conservancy funds but also, when faced with overflowing rivers and imminent dike collapses, fail to make every effort to repair and reinforce them, instead shifting responsibility to each other or arguing among themselves, thereby delaying river works and increasing the severity of disasters. This has been the case everywhere. Therefore, when discussing water conservancy construction today, the first step must be to unify water conservancy administration, so that authority is not fragmented, with a superior in charge and subordinates under its command. Only then can the country achieve the real effectiveness of paying attention to water conservancy and establish the actual achievements of water conservancy construction. Last year, the National Government instructed the entire country to "regard the Economic Commission as the central water conservancy agency." Recently, the Economic Commission, based on the National Government's instructions, drafted a reorganization plan for various water conservancy agencies, implementing the abolition and merger of overlapping water conservancy agencies. This is truly a reform that deeply addresses current malpractices and is welcomed by the people of the whole country. However, there is still something more that I want to say.</p>
<p>Water conservancy construction is the most arduous undertaking of the country. It is not possible to eliminate floods and establish real achievements in water conservancy construction without a specialized agency with greater authority, raising huge amounts of funds, providing long-term service, and formulating a comprehensive plan. However, the problem of talent is more important than anything else today. In the past, specialized talents in water conservancy agencies were often replaced due to domestic political changes. There were specialists without specialized positions, and those in specialized positions were not specialists. There was no specialized responsibility, and no specialized assignment. As a result, the water conservancy agencies were nominally non-existent. This is the fact. Today, domestic politics are gradually becoming stable, so experts working in water conservancy agencies should be kept in their positions for a long time. Let those with talent be secure in their positions, and let those with responsibility bear the burden. Then, the talents of experts can be displayed, and the achievements of water administration can be examined. This is one thing that needs to be planned and implemented by the Economic Commission.</p>
<p>China's rivers are long, spanning several provinces, while even small ones pass through several counties. The interests of the upstream and downstream are different, so the opinions of the people upstream and downstream on the advantages and disadvantages of water control methods are naturally difficult to unify. Without a comprehensive plan that takes into account the interests of all parties, those upstream will only focus on their own interests, while the downstream will face the risk of collapse; those downstream will only be concerned with avoiding disaster, while the upstream will face the worry of backflow. Speaking of past events, there was the dispute over the governance of the canal between Jiangsu and Shandong in the previous year, and the dispute over the diversion of the Luo River and the Yellow River into the Huai River in Anhui and Henan. Speaking of recent events, there was the dispute over dredging the Kui River by the people of several counties including Xiaoxian and Suxian. To make one's neighbor a moat and to block water from flowing are not good policies. To ensure that drainage and storage do not interfere with each other and that people upstream and downstream can support each other, a comprehensive plan is necessary. This is another thing that needs to be planned and implemented by the Economic Commission.</p>
<p>Today, taking advantage of the opportunity of the Economic Commission's publication of a preliminary plan to reform water conservancy, I would like to offer my humble opinion. If it can be realized as soon as possible, it will be fortunate for the people of the country.</p>
<h3>Schedule for US Economic Survey Mission to the East; Sixteen Members to Depart on the 22nd of This Month; Scheduled to Stay in Japan for Two Weeks and in China for Two Months</h3>

<h3>Chinese Eggs are Hygienic; British Importers Publish an Article in Response to Criticism in Parliament</h3>
<p>(London) The British House of Commons has recently voiced opposition to Chinese eggs imported into the UK, citing unsanitary production. However, today, egg importers published an article to Reuters, stating that there have never been any cases of infectious diseases caused by eggs imported from China. Although the samples obtained by chemists may not be aesthetically pleasing on the surface, their level of hygiene exceeds British standards. All liquid and frozen eggs imported into the UK come from China, and the UK's pastry trade in the past twenty years has relied entirely on Chinese eggs. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>April 1st. Germany Officially Establishes Air Force. Berlin Sends External Note to England, France and Italy. First Tear of the Treaty of Versailles</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The German government announced today that the German Air Force will be formally established on April 1st. This is Germany's first violation of the Treaty of Versailles' restrictions on German armaments. What is particularly important is that this move demonstrates German Chancellor Hitler's determination to implement German rearmament. Because European countries have failed to harmonize with Germany on this plan, Germany resolutely withdrew from the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference in 1933. Now, disregarding everything, it is acting unilaterally. The new air force will be under the command of Prussian Premier and Central Aviation Minister General Göring, who will also be given the title of "Flying General." The country will be divided into five air force districts, and a naval aviation commander will be appointed. The officer ranks of the new air force will be the same as those of regular army officers, but the uniforms will be slightly different. It is reported that the German government recently formally notified the aviation commissioners of the British, French, and Italian embassies of its intention to establish an air force. This notification is currently under consideration in England. Political circles in Rome are paying close attention to Germany's announcement and are considering it from military and national observation points. French authorities expressed their opinion that Germany's announcement makes it even more urgent to conduct negotiations with Germany based on the Anglo-French compromise reached in London on February 3rd. Germany is now disregarding the Treaty of Versailles and believes that following the guidelines set in the London discussions to achieve an indivisible security solution is the only correct path to peace. According to the London compromise, Germany would rejoin the League of Nations, and England, France, Germany, and Italy would sign a sky pact to curb aggression by any signatory country. Germany and other countries whose armaments are limited by treaties must not unilaterally change these obligations, and it is advocated that a general solution be made to establish a European security organization. As for Germany, the fifth article of the Treaty of Versailles that restricts its armaments is now intended to be replaced by a new one. These are all key points of the London compromise.

<h3>French Cabinet Resolves to Extend Military Service Period. From One Year to Two Years. To Build Another Battleship</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Cabinet meeting today resolved that the French military service period from 1935 to 1939 must be increased from one year to two years. Radical party cabinet members have always opposed submitting this issue to the May municipal elections. Premier Flandin has repeatedly received advice from former Army Chief General Gamelin and other military leaders, so he is determined to strengthen the army, regardless of all opposition. According to today's news, in addition to the 35,000-ton battleship whose funding has been approved by the parliament, there are now discussions to build another battleship of the same tonnage after January 1937. The government said this is sufficient proof that France is willing to abide by the tonnage limits set by the Washington Naval Treaty. As for other signatory countries, they have all already begun constructing warships of this tonnage. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The State Council today discussed the issue of France's military service years. The conscription law of 1928 stipulated a service period of one year. However, due to the decline in France's birth rate during the war, the number of new recruits in France has decreased since this year and cannot reach the number stipulated by the 1928 conscription law. Therefore, cabinet members unanimously advocated extending the military service years, but planned to handle it in two stages separately. In the first stage, the service period for new recruits enlisting on April 15th of this year will be extended by six months, for a total service period of one year and six months. This plan will be submitted by Premier Flandin to the House of Representatives for discussion this Friday. The second stage stipulates that the service period for new recruits enlisting on October 15th of this year will be extended by one year, for a total service period of two years. This plan must be submitted for discussion after the parliament's summer recess. This is because the European international political situation may change in these months, and international conventions for consolidating peace are expected to be signed, and the disarmament conference is expected to reopen. Therefore, it will be more appropriate for the parliament to discuss the necessary conditions for national security after several months. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The government recently submitted a bill to the House of Representatives regarding the 1935 naval shipbuilding program, requesting the construction of new ships to replace old battleships, such as the "Courbet" and "Paris," which have been in service for 25 years and must be replaced. The 1935 shipbuilding program requires a total of 16 million man-days of work, which will help alleviate the unemployment problem. From 1935 to 1939, the navy's total shipbuilding expenses will be 1,065,000,000 francs, of which (1) 785,000,000 francs will be used to build battleships, (2) 148,000,000 francs will be used to build two torpedo boats, and (5) 132,000,000 francs will be used to replenish military equipment and ammunition reserves. As for the tonnage of various warships, it is generally hoped that major naval powers can renegotiate and reach a general agreement in accordance with the Washington and London Treaties. However, qualitative restrictions on the navy must be effective only after the common consent of all countries. The current international situation forces France to not accept any new restrictions on the qualitative aspects. However, in order to avoid being the initiator, the tonnage of each ship in the next naval shipbuilding program will still follow the old restrictions, including the 1937 shipbuilding plan.

<h3>German Newspaper Discusses British Armaments. The Process of Changing from Disarmament to Rearmament</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The Foreign Political Report, authorized by the government, commented on the importance of the British House of Commons passing a 10 million pound increase in military spending for the navy, army, and air force in terms of politics, with the headline "The Victory of British Armaments Policy." It recognized this as the highest point reached by the British government's gradual policy change last year and the victory achieved by that policy. The report recounted this change, stating that two years ago, Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Simon submitted a draft disarmament treaty to Geneva, expressing a clear position on general disarmament. A year later, Lord Privy Seal Eden visited important European countries to negotiate disarmament. Although Britain encountered opposition from countries that were strengthening their armaments, it always adhered to the principle of disarmament. By the time the Disarmament Conference held its final meeting last May and June, French Foreign Minister Barthou's attitude had made all matters hopeless. Since then, no disarmament talks have been heard, only discussions of security issues. Last July, Britain announced that the Rhine River was its boundary. At that time, Prime Minister MacDonald had just returned from Canada and discovered that the international idealism he had adhered to had become a thing of the past, replaced by policies similar to pre-war diplomacy and military alliances. What we must understand here is that after this new policy emerged, the League of Nations lost its inherent importance. British politicians, because British public opinion was deeply influenced by those who believed in the League of Nations, still claimed to adhere to the principles of the League of Nations, but in fact, other factors had already been incorporated. During the debate in the House of Commons this Monday, government spokesmen had already won public opinion approval for the government's new position. Baldwin's speech touched on the armaments of Soviet Russia and other countries, but had been offset by the biased remarks a week earlier criticizing Germany's defense plans. At the same time, Foreign Secretary Simon said that if a certain European country does not belong to the League of Nations, we should still create a political environment to enable that country to return to the League of Nations for cooperation. Creating a political foundation to promote cooperation between Germany and other countries is the primary task of European politics. Foreign Secretary Simon's visit to Germany is the second step in this matter. Simon is tentatively scheduled to go to Germany at the end of March. Baldwin announced this matter on Monday, and Simon also said that he will carry out this trip with caution and friendship. This should be good news for those who hope that the Anglo-German talks can achieve substantive results. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>
<h3>Even After the Sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway Is Completed, the Crisis of Conflict Between Japan and Russia Is Not Completely Extinguished. Unbridled Ambition Makes Peace Difficult to Achieve. Commentary from The Times of London</h3>
<p>(London) An editorial in The Times of London today stated that the news of the signing of the first letter of the Chinese Eastern Railway sale contract is somewhat comforting. This is a victory of common sense over suspicion. Although the various underlying causes of tension between Japan and Russia have not been eliminated as a result, since one of the causes of conflict no longer exists, this tension can be eased. This contract indicates that both sides are unwilling to have a war. It shows that level-headed politicians can still dominate to avoid war. It is hoped that the military and civilian leaders of both sides will continue to cooperate harmoniously. If so, peace can be maintained. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>The News Communications Agency said that the following arrogant remarks made by the Vice President of the South Manchuria Railway about the Chinese Eastern Railway, as reported in the Tokyo Daily News, show the usual ambition of the Japanese side. Here is a translation: "Integrating the operation of all 'Manchurian' railways is the most urgent task in the transportation policy of Japan and 'Manchukuo.' However, the existence of the Chinese Eastern Railway is a great obstacle to this matter and hinders the smooth development of transportation. Now that the transfer negotiations have been completed, the Chinese Eastern Railway will become a key line of the 'Manchukuo' national railway in name and in fact, and will be controlled by the state operation. We are currently working hard to prepare for the takeover. We believe that after the takeover, the train will not stop for a moment and must at least ensure normal operation. At the same time, we also believe that more benefits will be obtained than when it was managed by the Soviet Union. What is particularly gratifying is that 6,000 Soviet railway employees must now return to their country, and the remaining positions can naturally be filled by Japanese people. Therefore, the success of the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway not only eliminates the source of the Soviet Union's red policy in the Far East, but also solves Japan's unemployment problem. It not only removes obstacles in railway operation, but is also a major success in the diplomatic history of Japan and 'Manchukuo.'" From this, we can see the ambition of the Japanese side.</p>
<h3>Agreement Documents. The Japanese Privy Council Begins Review. Shanghai Properties of the Eastern Railway Are Also Included in the Takeover</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The agreement between the Soviet Union and "Manchukuo" on the transfer of rights of the North Manchuria Railway to "Manchukuo," the exchange of official documents between Japan and Manchukuo regarding the transfer, and the protocol signed between Japan, "Manchukuo," and the Soviet Union, which were decided by the cabinet on the 12th to be immediately submitted to the Emperor, were submitted to the Privy Council for consultation on the 13th. Due to the importance of this matter, Privy Council President Iki submitted it to the review committee on the 13th. The first meeting of the review committee is scheduled to be held at the Privy Council office at 2:00 PM on the 14th. (Jiji Press, 13th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A Foreign Ministry spokesman said today that the Shanghai properties of the Chinese Eastern Railway are also included in the sales contract. The Soviet Union has transferred all the Eastern Railway properties to "Manchukuo" under this contract, so the Manchurian side will accept it. When someone asked whether the "Manchurian" side would take over the Eastern Railway properties in Vladivostok and other places, the spokesman replied that "Manchukuo" had given it up. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>The Puppet Raises Funds in Tokyo. To Issue Public Bonds with Railway Assets as Collateral</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) "Manchukuo's" "Finance Minister" Hoshino visited the President of the Bank of Japan yesterday to report on the process of acquiring the Eastern Railway, and said that in order to raise 170 million yuan for the acquisition, he plans to issue "Manchukuo" public bonds in Japan and asked the Bank of Japan for assistance. If the Bank of Japan issues public bonds to acquire the Eastern Railway, it will be granted the qualification that the Bank of Japan can discount them. (Dentsu, 13th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Because the transfer of the Eastern Railway will be formally signed and must be transferred at the same time, the Railway Bureau mobilized 5,000 Japanese, 1,300 Russians, and 2,500 Manchurians. 3,000 of the Japanese are temporary employees. After the transfer is implemented, although all senior Soviet officials will be dismissed, the five chiefs below the Director of the Ludi Administration have decided to serve as consultants for one month. (Dentsu, 13th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) The "Manchukuo" government's North Manchuria Railway Public Bond Law, which was related to the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway, was approved by the puppet emperor after consultation with the Senate on the 14th and will be announced on the same day. The content is as follows: (1) The government may issue public bonds limited to 180 million yen in order to pay for the expenses of the Soviet Union's transfer of the rights of the Chinese Eastern Railway. (1) The issue price, interest rate, and other matters shall be determined by the Minister of Finance. (1) The assets and all income of the North Manchuria Railway shall be used as collateral. (1) Due to the collateral relationship, the public bonds shall have priority over other claims. (Dentsu, 13th)</p>
<h3>Saito's Speech in the United States. "Japan-China Cooperation Is Seeking Peace. The Activity of Japanese Goods Is Not a Yellow Peril"</h3>
<p>(New York) Ambassador Saito to the United States gave the following speech to the Foreign Correspondents Association today on the recent situation between China and Japan, to express the attitude of the Japanese government. The main idea is that the sole purpose of the reconciliation between China and Japan is to restore peace in the Far East and ease the political tension in East Asia. This will not only make unlimited contributions to the goal of world peace, but also greatly reduce the risks of trade and investment in China for various countries. Japan has never closed its doors or abandoned the open-door policy, and the jealousy of China's rejection of Europe and the United States. Today, countries around the world have expressed various grievances about the activity of Japanese commerce. However, Japan is expanding its foreign trade with excellent products produced at low prices. I firmly believe that this is not a "yellow peril," but a great contribution to mankind. (Dentsu, 12th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saito Hiroshi attended the annual banquet of the Foreign Press Association of America tonight and delivered a speech on the situation of Japanese commercial activities and the world economic recovery. He briefly said that Japan, like the United Kingdom and the United States, is a strong supporter of restoring trade freedom and removing tariff barriers. US Secretary of State Hull recently signed commercial treaties with Belgium and Brazil respectively, attempting to restore trade freedom and spare no effort, which is commendable. He continued that people do not understand the situation in Japan and arbitrarily criticize it for engaging in dumping and dishonest competition, attributing it to Japan, and even calling Japan an "economic yellow peril." These accusations are completely inconsistent with the facts. Some people believe that Japan deliberately suppresses the exchange rate of the yen to use it as a tool for dumping. A review of the statistics will show that this is completely untrue. The Japanese government's subsidies for commerce are no more than those of other countries. The Japanese government's subsidies for shipping are only 2.8 million US dollars per year, while the British government's subsidies reach 4 million US dollars, France's reach 19 million US dollars, Italy's reach 21 million US dollars, and the United States' reach 28 million US dollars. Because of the hardships of life in Japan, industrial production has to increase its efficiency. The general public's publicity about the expansion of Japanese commerce is also inevitably exaggerated. In 1934, Japan's foreign exports accounted for only a little more than 3% of the world's export trade, while the United States' exports accounted for 10%, a difference of more than double. Moreover, Japan must purchase large quantities of raw materials from abroad, especially from the United States. Japan must also pay 74 million yen in foreign debt interest every year without delay. Therefore, Japan must increase its export trade in order to make up for it. It is rumored that China has now stopped boycotting Japanese goods. If so, the barriers to Sino-Japanese trade will be eliminated at once, which will naturally be beneficial to Japanese trade. As for Sino-Japanese cooperation, its purpose is only to restore peace in East Asia and gradually reduce the risks of trade and investment in various countries. There is absolutely no intention of excluding Western countries from participating in East Asia's economic recovery. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<h3>Tokyo Denies. Signing a Non-Aggression Pact with China</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) A Foreign Ministry spokesman today denied the rumors that Japan is currently negotiating with China to sign a non-aggression treaty, saying that these rumors are probably due to the remarks made by Japanese Ambassador to China Arima Akira that Japan has no plans to invade China, and the non-harming and non-aggression policies announced by Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota.

<h3>A Letter Published in the British Financial Newspaper. Advocates for American Banks to Lend to China. Following the Precedent of Cotton and Wheat Loans. Can Be Repaid with Silver Bars</h3>
<p>The newspaper commented that this move would be very difficult</p>
<p>(London) A reporter for the Financial Times today advised the United States to lend silver bars to China. The reporter, writing under the name "Jiujiang Road," said that his suggestion was the result of a thorough analysis of China's currency difficulties and advocated that the loan interest rate should be low and could be repaid with silver bars. He concluded that there was a precedent for this, namely the wheat and cotton loan signed by Song Ziwen. This loan obviously did not encounter political resistance, and only sought to sell America's surplus of wheat and cotton. Now, China urgently needs one thing, and the United States has a huge supply. Why not make another commodity loan? (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) The Financial Times published a letter signed "Jiujiang Road," advocating that the United States should lend silver bars to China at low interest, and China would also repay in silver bars in the future. Today, the newspaper criticized it, saying that China's current financial situation is caused by the actions of the American authorities. Although China levies silver export taxes and equalization taxes, it cannot strengthen domestic financial trust, just as it cannot enhance the reputation of President Luo's government. Lending silver bars to China can avoid direct exchange of US dollars, and the risk of speculation can be reduced. However, if the price of silver continues to rise, the debtor country will experience unusual difficulties in repaying the debt in the future. Only when China truly shows signs of restoring financial trust and stability can it borrow silver. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<h3>The Epidemic in Ceylon Has Slightly Subsided. Thousands Have Died</h3>

<h3>Our Country's Method of Paying League of Nations Membership Fees</h3>
<p>Luo Zhongyi and the League of Nations Agreed on Four Methods. Reduced by 500,000 Gold Francs Each Time Thereafter. The League of Nations May No Longer Recognize That China Owes Anything</p>
<p>(Geneva) It is reported that Luo Zhongyi, the Chinese envoy to Denmark, negotiated with the League of Nations, and a decision was made regarding the issue of China's annual payments to the League of Nations, and four methods were decided: (1) China's annual payment will be reduced by 120,000 gold francs to 1,270,000 gold francs; (2) The arrears from 1931 to 1934, amounting to approximately 3,000,000 gold francs, will be completely waived; (3) The previous arrears that had been reorganized will be reduced by approximately 2,000,000 gold francs; (4) All reorganized arrears, amounting to approximately 5,800,000 gold francs, will be allowed to be paid in installments over 45 years. The above methods are still subject to the approval of the Chinese government. After this, China's burden on the League of Nations can be reduced by 500,000 gold francs each year, and at the same time, it will no longer be recognized that China owes anything to the League of Nations. According to Ambassador Luo's statement to reporters, the above methods reduce the Chinese government's arrears by approximately 5,000,000 gold francs, which is also quite considerable. But the most important point is that the League of Nations will no longer recognize that China has failed to fulfill its old debts to it. This point is what China has insisted on the most.

<h3>The Chaco War Dispute. The League of Nations Fails to Mediate. Both England and France Intend to Shirk Responsibility. Our Representative's Speech Contains Sarcasm</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The major powers all intend to shirk responsibility for the war between Paraguay and Bolivia. At today's meeting of the League of Nations Advisory Committee, French representative Massigli declared that the neighboring countries of the two countries are geographically related, and it is easier for them to speak forcefully about this war. He once inquired whether these countries were willing to implement the resolutions of the League of Nations. If these countries cannot reach a solution, then the fault does not lie with the League of Nations. The British representative also agreed with this view. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) At today's meeting of the League of Nations Advisory Committee to discuss the war between Paraguay and Bolivia, the British and French representatives both intended to shirk responsibility. Hu Shize, the Chinese envoy to Switzerland, said in his speech that he could easily use extremely sarcastic remarks to criticize the League of Nations, which has encountered failure in one corner of the world, and is now in danger of stumbling in another corner. But he did not want to do so. He meant that even the most optimistic people could not hope to make the two countries cease fire immediately. The League of Nations Covenant must be applied to all continents. Ambassador Hu concluded that the Committee's actions were deviating from the report of the League of Nations General Assembly, which was very harmful. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Paraguayan Ambassador to the United States Bolt Nervo declared yesterday that the Paraguayan government would ask Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, and Peru to take action to end the Chaco War.

<h3>It Is Said That the British Prime Minister Will Retire. After the Anniversary of the British Emperor's Accession to the Throne. One Said He Will Exchange Positions with Baldwin</h3>
<p>(London) Although officialdom has recently stated that Prime Minister MacDonald's health is gradually improving, there are still many rumors about his actual situation and the possibility of his resignation. MacDonald has not been very involved in parliamentary affairs recently, which has aroused much criticism. However, according to his aides, even his doctors cannot make him rest quietly and not manage political affairs. In general, people believe that if the Prime Minister is determined to resign, he should not do so before the celebration and ceremonies of the 25th anniversary of the British Emperor's accession to the throne, so as to avoid far-reaching government impacts. In addition, there is another speculation that the Prime Minister may exchange positions with Lord President Baldwin, so as to maintain the nature of the government's national unity. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister MacDonald has suffered from bronchitis for several days. Although he has recovered, he is still resting at Chequers. Doctors also advised him to take good care of himself. People in parliament expressed concern about the Prime Minister's health. According to the "Evening News," the Prime Minister's political friends deeply believe that he has decided to give up the position of Prime Minister and take on a more leisurely position, such as the frequency of the Lord President. If so, the position of Prime Minister will be succeeded by the current Lord President Baldwin. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<h3>Greece Restores to Normalcy; Government Army Commander-in-Chief Returns in Triumph; Rebel Leaders Placed Under Italian Confinement</h3>
<p>Athens: The warships occupied by the rebels have surrendered one after another. The last one, the submarine "Katsonis," was detained today by the officers on board, who requested assistance from the government. Thus, the Greek rebellion has been completely quelled, and the general situation in Athens has quickly returned to normal. Residents who had feared bombardment by enemy ships and fled to the countryside are returning one after another. The capital is now celebrating the victory with flags, and the atmosphere of singing and dancing is vastly different from the tense situation of the previous week. However, martial law has not yet been lifted and will remain in effect until the military court has completed the trial of more than 300 rebels. Premier Tsaldaris, in a speech at the celebration, declared that the rebels would be sentenced to perpetual exile. Today, the authorities ordered the confiscation of Venizelos's property and residence and its transfer to the Mayor of Athens. At the same time, the government has instructed its ambassador to Bulgaria to negotiate with the Bulgarian government for the extradition of rebel leader General Kammenos and seventeen other important military officers. After the defeat, Kammenos led his staff and fled south into Bulgarian territory from the border town of Masdaner, and nothing has been heard of their whereabouts since. Venizelos's party has many members, including army and navy officers and government personnel, all of whom are fleeing the country. The government has ordered the captured rebel leaders to be handed over to the military court for trial. It is reported that Greece will hold general elections soon. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Fifty-six Greek army and navy officers and more than one hundred other officials who participated in the failed revolution landed safely in Italy today. The Romanian government has instructed border guards to prevent Greek revolutionaries from entering the country, in stark contrast to the attitude of the Italian government. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>Athens: The attempt by former Premier Venizelos to overthrow the government has completely failed today. Venizelos, a few hours before the government forces recaptured the island of Crete, fled with his wife and about one hundred rebel officers aboard the cruiser "Averoff." After landing on the island of Kasos in the Aegean Sea, they were placed under confinement by the Italian authorities. The "Averoff" has sailed back to Greece and intends to surrender to the authorities. The remaining rebel ships surrendered in Souda Bay today and are awaiting orders from the authorities. According to a Reuters report from Rome, the Italian authorities are likely to regard Venizelos as a political refugee. The Italian government has consistently refused to extradite such political prisoners, so it may not make an exception for Venizelos. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Athens: All of Greece is celebrating General Kondylis's suppression of the rebellion. Propaganda teams are on the streets, loudly congratulating the victory. People hold images of Premier Tsaldaris, Minister Kondylis, and Mitakos, causing traffic jams. Minister of the Army General Kondylis arrived here by plane from Macedonia and was warmly welcomed by the crowd. Kondylis responded with a smile. All shops were closed to celebrate, and flags flew throughout the city. When General Kondylis, Premier Tsaldaris, and Minister Mitakos appeared on the balcony of the Premier's residence, the people cheered wildly. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>Athens: The rebellion has now been quelled. The government has now allowed commercial aircraft from various countries to fly over Greek territory or land in Greece, and everything has returned to normal. The submarine cables that were cut by the rebels have now been repaired. According to a communiqué issued by the Ministry of the Army, the war in the province of Macedonia since the 4th of this month resulted in the deaths of nine soldiers and civilians and the injury of ninety-six people. The Archbishop of Athens has ordered all churches under his jurisdiction to hold prayers to celebrate the victory of the government forces. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>Salonica, Greece: Minister of the Army General Kondylis recently declared to newspaper reporters, "The rebels who resorted to arms this time will be brought to justice as a warning to others, and there will be no leniency." Regarding the issue of the next election, he said that the matter would be decided by Premier Tsaldaris. However, in any case, the followers of the rebel leader Venizelos are not tolerated by the law and cannot participate in the election. The provinces recaptured by the government forces are all peaceful, and railway and telegraph communications have been restored to their original state. The last two classes of reservists mobilized by the government some days ago have been demobilized. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>Athens: The speed of the Macedonian rebels' defeat seemed to be beyond expectations. As a result, the revolutionary tide in Greece has now collapsed, and the rebel leader Venizelos, who was formerly the premier, has also fled overseas and escaped into Italy. Venizelos, together with Naval Admiral Toursite, former Finance Minister Marris, and other rebel leaders, arrived at the island of Kasos this afternoon aboard the rebel ship "Georgios Averoff." The island belongs to the Italian Dodecanese Islands, and Venizelos and others landed there. After the rebel leaders landed, the rebel captain communicated with the national government by radio, saying that he was willing to lead the ship back to the country and surrender, and was prepared to sail the ship into the Salamis naval shipyard to await government disposal. According to a semi-official report, before abandoning the island of Crete, the rebel leaders had removed all the cash stored in banks, customs, and other public institutions. Crete and other islands have now been recovered, and the officials who were expelled by the rebels have been restored to their original positions. General Didster has also been restored to his position as commander of the garrison on the island of Crete. The sailors of the destroyers "Psara" and "Leon II" and the submarine "Nireus" have reported to the naval department that the captains of these ships have abandoned their posts and fled, and have requested the government to send personnel to take over. The government immediately dispatched the naval officers who were detained on the island of Crete by the rebels to take over. Today, the people of Athens are celebrating with joy. The residence of Premier Tsaldaris and the railway station are the centers of celebration. Minister of the Army Sotherilis also led the national army back to the capital in triumph this afternoon, and the people gave him a fervent welcome at the station. A declaration was also issued this morning, strongly stating that the current government has no intention of restoring autocracy, and asking the people not to believe the lies of the rebel leader Venizelos. Kondylis's suppression of the rebellion with lightning speed is regarded by the public as that of a generation of heroes. The publication of this declaration has further increased the people's faith. Kondylis overcame the rebellion of General Metaxas in 1923, overthrew the military dictatorship of Pangalos in 1926, and quelled the rebellion of Plastiras in 1933. Now, he has conquered his political enemy Venizelos, so the Greek people worship Kondylis as a national hero. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>(Rome) After landing on the island of Kasos, Greek leader Venizelos told Italian newspaper reporters that he would permanently withdraw from Greece and politics, and only hoped that Greece would have a bright future and continue to fulfill its mission. The revolution had a glorious purpose, but he did not consider using force. Venizelos believes that he cannot return to Greece, and attributes it to fate. He will reside here temporarily, hoping to spend his exile in Italy and France in the future. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>
<h3>Progress in the Cuban Situation; Government Responds with Stern Measures; Revolutionary Movement Shows Signs of Wavering</h3>
<p>Havana: After the government curbed the riots with stern plans, the situation in Havana has gradually improved. The President issued an article today, saying that he expects everything to return to normal within three days. In recent days, the rioters have been incited by the left-wing movement to overthrow the government, engaging in acts of throwing bombs and sniping. The President was forced to declare Havana in a state of war. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Havana: The revolutionary general strike has eased somewhat today. After Army Commander-in-Chief Batista strictly enforced martial law, the national revolutionary movement has shown signs of wavering. Government leaders expect that President Mendieta's power will soon be fully restored. According to the Associated Press today, sixteen people died in this incident. Mr. Sivia, who served as president for twenty-four hours after President Machado stepped down two years ago, claimed that the government forces implemented a three-day reign of terror, and 300 members of the opposition party have been killed. This claim could not be verified by reliable sources. After the riots broke out last Saturday, Mr. Sivia fled to Miami, USA. Officials from the State Department, the Justice Department, the Ministry of Transportation, and the Ministry of Finance have all returned to work this morning. The telephone service in the capital has also been restored to its original state, but it is not yet fully connected elsewhere. Traffic order has gradually recovered, and food is gradually being transported to the capital, so the starvation panic should be slightly reduced. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>Havana: The government punishes the opposition with stern measures, and as a result, the opposition party has shown signs of disappearing. In the future, those who carry explosives and commit destructive acts will be sentenced to death. All those who engage in incitement will be tried by military courts. The government has ordered a curfew from 9:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. to prevent petty criminals from taking advantage of the situation. It is rumored that if the government cannot stop the strike, it will request American intervention. The State Department has specifically denied this statement again. Several union offices were vandalized today. More than twenty people were injured by bomb explosions and gunfire yesterday afternoon. The railway strike has gradually become widespread, but so far, several trains are still running as usual. (Havas, 12th)</p>

<h3>Mei Lanfang and Hu Die Arrive in Moscow; Grand Occasion; Russian Foreign Ministry and Various Groups Welcome at the Station; Pravda Publishes Article Praising Mei's Art</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Dr. Mei Lanfang and his troupe, along with Professor Zhang Pengchun and others, arrived in Moscow today. Soviet writer Tretyakov and Chinese Counselor Oshanin of the Soviet Military Embassy first went to Alexandrov, a few hours away from here, to greet them, and then traveled here together. When they arrived at the station, they were greeted by members of the reception committee, key members of the Foreign Affairs Committee, personnel from the Soviet Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, personnel from the Chinese Embassy (led by Mr. Wu Nanru), citizens, representatives from the theater industry, and Chinese visitors. The representative of the Association for Cultural Relations delivered a welcoming speech first. Mei replied, "My good dream has now come true. I have arrived in the Soviet Union." The arrival of Mei and his troupe and the reception were filmed by the Cooperative Film Company. The female star Hu Die and director Zhou also came with Mei. (TASS, 12th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Young Pravda published a special article on the arrival of the Mei Lanfang troupe in the Soviet Union, with an essay by the famous Soviet director Eisenstein on the development of Chinese drama. Eisenstein said, "Mei Lanfang is studying ancient stage art. Mei is a great artist and a pillar of scholarship and national culture. He restores the actor's art to its previous comprehensive artistic form, making it colorful, completing the combination of action, music, and ancient costumes. However, Mei is not only a revivalist. He fills the traditional forms with new content. He intends to make his plays involve social issues. Goldring has pointed out this point. Goldring, from the hundreds of scripts written by Mei, pointed out his works involving the low social status of women. Some works discuss the struggle against backward religious superstitions and prejudices. He uses the old traditional format to portray modern problems, so it has a special vitality and beauty. Mei's scripts discuss women's issues from various perspectives. Mei's genius lies in portraying various female roles. Artists are often very narrow, suitable for playing certain roles, but Mei is not. He can play various roles, vividly." Eisenstein concluded, "The experience of Chinese art will definitely provide us with rich research materials and improve our artistic methods. We express our warm welcome to our friend Mr. Mei Lanfang, as a great artist and an outstanding representative of Chinese culture." The Soviet Art magazine also published an essay by Chen, who said,</p>
<p>"We believe that Soviet audiences will be able to correctly understand and evaluate Chinese drama, and regard it as an example of Chinese national culture. The Moscow public has repeatedly expressed its deep sympathy for the educational value of national drama. The people of Moscow have always warmly welcomed the personnel of national theaters and have continuously encouraged national theaters within the Soviet Union. This has already proven the accuracy of the above." (TASS, 12th)</p>

At the same time, the general public is now closely watching whether gold coins will be unable to withstand the pressure of the low pound sterling. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt to Declare No Change in Cotton Policy; New York Cotton Market Sees Slight Rebound</h3>
<p>(Washington) Yesterday, it was rumored that President Roosevelt would abandon most of the cotton production restriction plan and would stop lending to cotton producers, so the cotton market on the exchange fell sharply. Today, Senator Smith, chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, declared that President Roosevelt will issue a statement, indicating that there will be no change in his policy on the cotton industry. As a result, the New York cotton market rebounded by three to seven points today. (Havas, 12th)</p>

<p>Xinjiang's Abundant Products</p>
<p>Xinjiang's products are abundant.</p>
<p>(4) Jade, Hetian jade, black jade, and Lop Nur all produce it, but the best comes from Hetian. (5) Others, such as gypsum, graphite, and construction sand, are also plentiful.

<p>Shanxi laborers going to the Northeast are decreasing: Japanese selling [entrance] permits, our side is negotiating to prohibit it.</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The Japanese have established the Daito Company Qingdao Office in this city, specializing in selling [entrance] permits to laborers as "national citizens." The Public Security Bureau has already negotiated to ban it. It is now found that tens of thousands of farmers from Shanxi go to the Northeast every spring to earn a living. This year, due to the influence of the Daito Company selling "national citizen" permits, the number going to the Northeast has greatly decreased. The small inns specializing in housing laborers have also been affected, and business is unusually depressed, with everyone complaining bitterly. The situation of the Public Security Bureau's negotiations with the Japanese consulate is reported as follows:</p>
<h3>Prohibition of Chinese Labor Export</h3>
<p>Because the company in Qingdao sells fake "national citizen" permits, damaging our sovereignty, the Public Security Bureau is negotiating with the Japanese consulate to ban it and is sending police to the docks to check. Anyone carrying such permits will be detained. Police are also stationed at train stations, and farmers and workers coming to Qingdao to go to the Northeast by train will be sent to inns for temporary lodging. A letter will then be sent to the Jiaoji Railway Bureau</p>
<h3>Special Train to Return Home with Funds</h3>
<p>The method of providing funds is divided into three types: (1) Those within 50 li of the station will receive one yuan per person. (2) Those within 100 li will receive two yuan. (3) Those beyond 100 li will receive three yuan. In recent days, about seven or eight hundred people have been sent back to their hometowns with funds. According to news from the docks, about two hundred Chinese workers who went to the Northeast some time ago have returned to Qingdao by boat from Dalian in recent days because they could not bear the Japanese oppression and other hardships. They said that they originally had farmland in the Eastern Provinces, but now, because the Northeastern Volunteer Army is very active, the Japanese, in order to strengthen the walls and clear the fields, do not allow Chinese to build houses to settle down and are subject to various restrictions. They were forced to abandon their property and return to their hometowns quickly.</p>
<h3>Japanese Consulate Does Not Prohibit</h3>
<p>Since the Public Security Bureau has negotiated with the Japanese consulate in Qingdao, the Japanese consul found it inconvenient to interfere. Later, they claimed that the company was under the jurisdiction of the "East" range and that diplomatic officials could not intervene. They ultimately allowed it to continue its actions without banning it, only ordering the company to change the "national citizen" permit to a letter of introduction to deal with the situation. The Public Security Bureau, unable to achieve results, reported the situation to the municipal government, which reportedly forwarded it to the central government to request instructions.</p>
<p>Songjiang Water Police Discover Major Trafficker Details</p>
<p>Fan Zhicheng, the third team leader of the first district stationed in Zhu of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police Team, seized a large batch of private opium some days ago. Details were reported yesterday. Now, the details have been learned. This private opium was discovered on the 9th at the Huangpu River estuary rice market ferry, where the border between Songjiang and Jinshan counties lies. A small boat was observed with suspicious behavior, and an order to search was given. Forty large packages of private opium, weighing 2,130 taels, were found, along with Zhou A'er, Shen Maosheng, and Yang Hexian. It was learned that they were being sent to Li Binshan's home in Fengjiang. Captain Fan immediately dispatched officer Hu Jinfu to the destination, where he found Lu Furong with six pieces of Sichuan opium, weighing four jin, seven pieces of material, weighing 23 taels and 12 liang, and scattered prohibited evidence. According to their confession, Li Binshan, Li Daosheng, Li Huchen, and Zhang A'he jointly established the business many years ago, specializing in selling opium to Jiahe in Suzhou and Songjiang in Shanghai. They transported and sold it secretly and had rarely been caught until now. Over the years, they have made countless profits and have a very large operation.

<p>Wuxi Fortune Teller Commits Suicide by Poison</p>
<p>In recent years, due to social and economic panic, the number of unemployed people has been increasing day by day. Desperate, most have embarked on the path of suicide. In recent days, there have been suicide cases in the county almost every day. Yesterday, Tang Baoshan, a resident of No. 4 Mengyuan Lane, Tongyun Road, who worked as a cook for a noodle shop, committed suicide. Because he was blind, he could not find a way to earn a living, so he was introduced to learn fortune-telling. However, recently, Tang suddenly had the idea of committing suicide. He bought raw opium and sorghum wine and secretly swallowed them to commit suicide. When someone noticed, he was immediately sent to the brothers' hospital for treatment, but he was already too deeply poisoned, and he died shortly after.</p>
<p>On-site Investigation of Grave Robbery</p>
<p>Zhou Qin, who resides in Xinjie Lane in the city, has an ancestral tomb located in Zhangwan Mountain under the 21st Lijian Village in the fourth district. Last September, the gravedigger Qin A'de colluded with Zhao Chunsheng and Zhao Qi to sell it to Lu Yongqing, a practitioner in Sipu Bridge outside the North Gate. They destroyed the tomb mounds and enclosures. When Zhou Qin learned of this, he hired lawyer Wu Chengkui to file a complaint with the local branch court's prosecutor's office. Prosecutor Lian Zhenbang went to the countryside for an on-site investigation. Qin A'de, Zhao Qin, and others falsely claimed that it was their family's ancestral vacant land. Zhou Qin requested to open it for inspection, but Prosecutor Lian did not allow it and gave the defendants a decision not to prosecute. Zhou Qin refused to accept the decision and applied for reconsideration. The Higher Court sent it back for re-investigation. The day before yesterday (the 12th) at 7:00 AM, Prosecutor Ren Guanghai, accompanied by Secretary Wang, Judicial Police Chief Zhu Wanwan, and bailiffs Ling Yuzhu, Hu Shouzhen, Hang Ying, and Li Changqing, went to the countryside and requested the Tiefeng Public Security Branch Office to send a police chief and eight police officers to assist. Prosecutor Ren ordered earthworkers to excavate. After digging three feet and five inches, three coffins were found, and one of the coffins had the words "Spirit of Zhou Gong of Yiting, Conferring Official Title of Chao Yi Da Fu, Yunnan Zhifu" painted on the head. The words were brought to the court for filing, and Zhao An was taken to the court for detention pending investigation.</p>
<p>Saved from Suicide Due to Economic Pressure</p>
<p>Xue Ziqing, the owner of the Hongtai soy sauce and grocery store under Tonghui Bridge outside the North Gate, is about fifty years old. He previously worked as a manager at Cai Senmao's cottonseed cake shop in Zhuchang Lane with a monthly salary of forty yuan. However, Xue has two wives. His wife, surnamed Mou, has already given birth to two sons and two daughters and lives with Xue's elderly mother in the South Gate, with Xue providing ten yuan per month for living expenses. His concubine, Xu, is forty-six years old and has also given birth to a son named A'nan, who lives with Xue in the Hongtai store. The remaining thirty yuan of Xue's monthly salary is all spent by Xu. Usually, they lived peacefully, but in the spring of last year, Cai Senmao's oil shop suddenly dismissed Xue, so Xue's life suddenly became difficult. He had no choice but to live with his concubine Xu in Hongtai. Recently, the store's business has been affected by the social recession and is unusually depressed and difficult to manage. Xu often asked Ziqing for money, causing daily quarrels. Ziqing, being burdened by economic difficulties and unable to cope with the difficult environment, had the idea of committing suicide. Yesterday (the 12th) morning at about 7:00 AM, he took a cotton rope and hung it from the beam, hoping to hang himself. Fortunately, a neighboring woman discovered it early, so he was saved.</p>

<p>Five Million Credit Loan Expected to Be Realized by the End of the Month</p>
<p>Silver and Money Industries Undertake Goods Mortgage, Three Banks Continue to Lend to Maintain the Market</p>
<p>Regarding the special committee of the Local Association's decision to implement the government-business joint venture of five million credit small loans within the industrial and commercial relief plan, the Bankers Association is scheduled to submit it to the Executive Committee meeting for discussion today, and the Money Industry Association is scheduled to hold a general meeting of members tomorrow to make a decision. A reporter from Xin Xin News Agency learned from important industries yesterday morning that the financial community generally supports the credit small loan in principle and will organize a syndicate to handle it in the future. Its capital of five million yuan, of which the government will be responsible for 2.5 million yuan through the Central Bank, and the remaining half will be borne by the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, Shanghai banks, and money houses. The loan regulations and measures will be drafted and decided by the syndicate. According to the banking community, the loan is expected to be realized by the end of this month if no problems occur in the middle. The loan amount will generally range from one thousand yuan to ten thousand yuan. Industrial and commercial enterprises in Shanghai, shops, and factories operated with Chinese capital will use a joint guarantee system to request a loan from the bank. It is also learned that the mortgage loans for the silver and money industries organized by the Central, China, and Communications banks are still being disbursed as usual to rescue the market. Silver and money industries that need funds can request disbursement with corresponding collateral. As for the mortgage loans for goods, the silver and money industries have now fully resumed undertaking them to maintain the market.</p>

<p>Research Report on Industrial and Commercial Financial Issues</p>
<p>Economic experts Yang Yinpu, Zhang Naiqi, and Zhang Xiaomei released the following "Research Report on Commercial and Financial Issues": (1) Introduction. We have been entrusted by the China General Federation of Industry to study the advantages and disadvantages of inflationary monetary policies and whether they are possible. This matter is deeply related to the future of the national economy. From the perspective of industry and commerce, for the current crisis of high currency values and falling prices, there must be a strategy sufficient to stabilize the balance between currency values and prices to cope with it. It is not only a hope worthy of sympathy but also an essential plan to save the crisis. The credit crunch and the frequent bankruptcies of industrial and commercial enterprises, the serious situation is undeniable, and no amount of denying the truth or beautifying the situation will be effective. Furthermore, it is undeniable that our country is currently facing internal and external troubles, and the crisis is affecting the entire national economy. The financial industry and industry and commerce are in the same boat. How can they blame each other and allow others to benefit? The financial industry, in the development of panic, for its own safety, suddenly has no way to respond to the expectations of industry and commerce, which is the real situation. However, to say that it is like Qin Yueren sitting and watching without helping is an exaggeration. We believe that the most important thing now is for both parties to be frank and mutually helpful, to do their best, and then to improve the technology and system so that the limited financial resources can meet the urgent needs. Then, with one heart and one mind, jointly deal with external pressure, which is enough to say survival. Therefore, based on this purpose, this research report is made. (2) The Gains and Losses of Inflationary Monetary Policies. The results of the trials of inflationary monetary policies in various countries in the East and West show that its function can only be a temporary stimulus to prices, an unselective reduction of the burden on debtors, and cannot fundamentally increase purchasing power. However, the stimulation of prices is limited to a temporary period. Therefore, in order to maintain prices, the currency must continue to inflate, which will become a situation that is difficult to reverse. Without sufficient national strength and proper use, the result is often a complete failure. However, its reduction of the debt burden has no separation, so the deepest pain is often for those who rely on savings to survive, and a part of the wealthy can instead obtain undue windfall profits due to proper distribution of assets. If so, the result of seeking fairness is instead a very unfair result. In addition, the oppression of consumers and wage earners is an undeniable fact. (3) Concerns About China's Adoption of Inflationary Monetary Policies. In China, there are also points that must be given special consideration, namely, the incompleteness of the economic and political barriers. Inflation is not liked by foreign merchants in China, which is a very obvious fact. Once implemented, foreign banks will inevitably immediately adopt the Hong Kong dollar as the benchmark exchange rate. Foreign public utilities, such as the Shanghai Electric Power Company and the Shanghai Telephone Company, will probably also change to Hong Kong dollar charges. Even further, foreign banks can maintain their original standard full redemption as a selling point to promote their banknotes, thereby absorbing Chinese funds. This has already begun in foreign banks that are severely short of cash, and future development is a very natural cause and effect. If so, foreign banks will restore their overwhelming power over Chinese banks, and the currency disorder in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the advantages gained by foreign currencies in the market will be similar to the past in the Northeast and the current Southwest. After foreign currencies gain an advantage, the inflationary monetary policy will be a continuation of the cash concentration policy of the past Wuhan government and will quickly fail. Its achievements will be to destroy the currency unification that has been created through years of hard work, while at the same time harming the fish and causing foreign financial forces to reduce Chinese financial forces. The so-called rescue of industrial and commercial enterprises will ultimately become a pancake. Even in terms of creditor-debtor relations, inflation may not affect foreign creditors in China and will ultimately become a biased and chaotic situation. Foreign creditors in China are either calculated in foreign currencies or have sufficient guarantees. If the former, the result of inflation is sufficient to increase the burden on debtors. If the latter, due to the existence of extraterritoriality, foreign merchants can arbitrarily dispose of collateral to seek the fulfillment of the "silver clause" in the loan contract, which will result in an unexpected loss for the debtor. (The case of Shenxin No. 7 Factory is a suitable example.) Some say that the result of currency devaluation due to inflation can stimulate the export of local goods. However, based on past experience, from 1929 to 1931, the value of the Chinese currency fell unprecedentedly with the price of silver, but export trade instead declined. It can be seen that the strategy to stimulate export trade is definitely not limited to reducing the value of the currency. In short, China is a large continental country with abundant natural resources, and the foundation of the national economy should theoretically be established on the principle of self-sufficiency. However, in order to establish a grand scale, it is necessary to actively build a complete tariff barrier and passively restrict the privileges of foreign merchants to establish factories in China. Under these conditions, fully develop industry to consume domestic raw materials, then the foundation of the national economy will be solid, and the reliance on international trade will be minimal. However, under the constraints of unequal treaties, the acquisition of these conditions requires great effort, and the financial industry and industry and commerce should work together to achieve the realization of these conditions. Do not become the bitter gourd of each other to reach the tragic situation of mutual destruction. This should be the current awareness. Furthermore, it must be supplemented that the above-mentioned inflationary paragraph is actually a special difficulty in China's implementation, and it is also the result of the effect of unequal treaties. The decline of China's current industry is even more said to be constrained by unequal treaties than to blame the financial community for not providing assistance. Therefore, if China can obtain the abolition of unequal treaties, all economic problems can be solved easily. Otherwise, even if the last resort of inflation is adopted, the result will only be a miserable failure that will not take long to return. (4) Does China Need Inflation? We believe that the most urgent need of China's current economy is the expansion of credit, not the expansion of currency. In various countries in the East and West, the expansion of credit has reached its extreme due to the full use of credit instruments such as bills and securities. Therefore, once a panic occurs, without currency inflation, it will fall into a situation of inability to continue. In China, bills and securities are just beginning to sprout. The method of discounting bills is only for foreigners to smooth import and export trade and has not reached the local industry and commerce. The issuance of industrial securities has also only become a tool for foreign industries in China to absorb Chinese funds and is unknown to local industry and commerce. The issuance of huge amounts of bonds by the Shanghai Electric Power Company and the Shanghai Telephone Company in recent years has mostly absorbed Chinese funds, while local industrial securities are insignificant. How can this not be strange? If we can catch up quickly, seize the opportunity, and work together to create credit instruments, then, in the current situation, it is definitely not impossible to create tens of millions of yuan of bills in Shanghai. The financial industry's accommodation of discounting them can ease the current tension. The issuance of industrial securities may not be developed at this time, but if a foundation can be established on a smaller scale first, then after the financial relaxation, the future progress is also unlimited. (5) Complete a Modern Silver and Money Market. "Complete a modern silver market and create a modern capital market." This is our long-standing proposition. The backbone of a modern silver and money market is bill discounting, and the content of a modern capital market is the circulation of industrial securities. Credit to people and credit to things are both outdated methods and are definitely not sufficient to meet the needs of the current economic community. We believe that this proposition has the possibility and necessity of being realized at this time of unprecedented panic. The biggest difficulty for industry and commerce now is the stagnation of accounts receivable. The reason why accounts receivable are stagnant is that the payment of credit purchases does not know how to use the transfer of bills. If accounts receivable can be turned into transferable bills, then in one transfer, tens of thousands of dollars of accounts receivable on the market can be used to obtain financial accommodation through bill discounting. The Shanghai Silk Industry Association has taken the lead in adopting the method of paying for goods with bills. If it can be extended to all industries, then there is no doubt that it can save the current crisis. In order to make it easier for the financial industry to turn around, the creation of bank acceptance bills and the implementation of rediscount methods are both necessary. The use of bank acceptance bills can also turn goods in storage into circulating bills. Because its content is more complicated, it will not be described in detail here. The meaning of the above is to seek its circulation. However, in terms of the current economic crisis, in addition to being able to circulate, it is also necessary to be able to return the flow. The financial industry is to the economic community as blood is to the human body. Stopping blood is a major disaster, and bleeding can also be fatal. Following this, the direction of credit expansion must be added with the necessary conditions, that is, the result of credit expansion must negatively reduce the outflow of funds and actively stimulate the inflow of funds. If so, under the current circumstances, the object of credit expansion must be domestic industrial and commercial merchants who transport and sell local products. If foreign goods can reduce one point of demand and local products can increase one point of export, then cash can reduce one point of outflow crisis. Therefore, domestic factories must seek to increase production due to credit expansion, and local products must seek not to stagnate due to credit expansion. If so, the funds released by the financial industry will still flow back to the financial industry. It will not shake the financial foundation, but instead increase the business of the financial industry. The situation of the financial industry and industry and commerce coexisting and prospering will be completed. On the other hand, if the target of credit expansion is merchants who transport and sell foreign goods, then the more credit expands, the greater the crisis of cash outflow. After the funds are released once, there is no hope of returning the flow. The result is only that the financial industry and industry and commerce will fall into destruction together. However, if the imported goods are production tools and necessary raw materials, then it should be treated differently. (6) Create a Modern Capital Market. The development of a country's industry depends on the rise of limited liability organizations. This is a certain and unchanging cause and effect in history. However, the rise of limited liability organizations still depends on the ability of stocks and corporate bonds to circulate through buying, selling, and mortgages. The shortcomings of China's current industry are that the securities market has no market for industrial securities (stocks and corporate bonds). As a result, the exchange is suffering from the lack of industrial securities that can be bought and sold, the financial industry is suffering from the lack of a publicly determined market for industrial securities from which to accept mortgages, and the industry is suffering from the lack of a way for stocks to circulate and for corporate bonds to be issued. If both parties are deadlocked, then the situation will never be opened. Only through joint research and collective planning, the possibility of issuing and circulating industrial securities can achieve the regeneration of the entire economic community. The current development of this issue seems to first start with the financial industry taking the lead in changing all loans and mortgages to factories into the issuance of corporate bonds. If so, the financial industry can change all of its own accounts receivable into transferable certificates. Once this certificate flows into the hands of general investors due to buying and selling, the financial industry can go one step further and give the industry more funds to facilitate. In one transfer, both parties' funds can each obtain a way to circulate and have no worries about stagnation. In addition, the issuance of stocks and preferred stocks can be launched in a timely manner to establish the scale of the capital market. In addition, it must be stated that the method of issuing circulating bonds with industry as a guarantee is very outdated, and the drawbacks are even more difficult to overcome. If it is implemented in the mainland, it will become the basis for military separatism. If it is implemented in Shanghai, the international market, it will be appropriate to disrupt the currency system as a bad result. For the sake of the future of the national economy, I dare not agree. (7) Conclusion. The path from currency chaos to unification is an inevitable path for national evolution. The development of the credit system from personal credit to credit to things, and then to bills and securities credit, is a certain procedure for the development of the national economy. The greatest progress in China's finances in recent years has been the unification of the currency system in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River after the abolition of the tael and the change to the yuan. This progress must be maintained. The current shortcomings of China's finances are that after moving from personal credit to credit to things, it has become stagnant. The development of securities credit is only a skewed development that is biased toward financial securities (government bonds and treasury bills). This is an undeniable fact. However, this cause and effect is also mostly due to the environment, and it is impossible to admit that the financial community should bear the blame alone. The pursuit of the safety of one's own business is the same for the financial, industrial, and commercial industries. The financial industry must bear the heavy responsibility of supporting industry and commerce on the one hand, and on the other hand, it also bears the heavy trust of depositors and should plan for its safety. Finance is valuable in circulation, and lending funds is for the benefit of the financial community itself. As long as the safety of the financial industry is guaranteed, there is no worry about its own funds being stagnant. There is definitely no reason not to be happy to lend. Therefore, creating credit instruments, so that banks can have objects to lend funds to, and allowing the financial system that stays in the credit of things to quickly advance to the credit of bills and securities, will not only temporarily save the current panic, but also permanently establish the grand scale of the national economy. If it can be said above, using a stable expansion of credit instead of an unsound means of currency inflation, the increased chips will be more than just relying on real estate and commodity guarantees to issue circulating bonds, because the use of accounts receivable is not something that circulating bonds can include. Under this serious panic, the Chinese economic community has an unprecedented awareness. One side, the industry is united to seek survival, which is a good phenomenon. On the other hand, the financial community, when cash is constantly flowing out, also deeply feels that without promoting domestic industry and reducing the surplus, the foundation of financial stability cannot be stabilized. If we can cooperate at this time and thoroughly build the relationship between the financial industry and industry and commerce as complementary, and jointly deal with external attacks, then it will not only be the luck of the economic community, but also the blessing of the national future. In addition, regarding the technical design, because the content is more complicated, it will be described in detail in a special article.</p>
<p>Yu Xuezhong Arrived in Shanghai from Hangzhou Last Night</p>
<p>It Is Said That Huang Fu's Descent from the Mountain Has Not Been Scheduled Yet.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Yu Xuezhong, chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, entered Beijing this time to report to the central government on the situation of the Yellow River breach and went to Mogan Mountain to meet with Huang Yingbai, chairman of the Political Rectification Committee of the Executive Yuan stationed in Beijing, to report on the recent situation in North China. He completed his official duties yesterday and took the midday train to Shanghai. Those who went to greet him at the North Station at 10:35 PM included Li Dachao, representative of Mayor Wu, and Huang Yongxi, director of the Hebei Provincial Government's Beijing Office. After Mr. Yu got off the train, he went to his hotel to rest and is scheduled to stay in Shanghai for one or two days before entering Beijing and returning north. According to Mr. Yu, he went to Mogan Mountain to meet with Chairman Huang this time to report on the recent situation in North China. Chairman Huang's health has not fully recovered and he will stay in Mogan for a short period of time. As for when he will descend the mountain, he did not mention it. According to Mr. Huang Yongxi, Hebei Province is the first to bear the brunt of the Yellow River breach. Although the Hebei Provincial Government has tried its best to block it, the situation is extremely dangerous. The Yellow River breach is related to multiple provinces, and the power to manage water conservancy is in the hands of the National Water Conservancy Committee. Therefore, Chairman Yu especially entered Beijing to report on the situation of the breach and the process of blocking it and to request instructions on the direction of managing the Yellow River water conservancy. As for going to Mogan Mountain to meet with Chairman Huang Yingbai, it was only to report on the recent situation in North China and there was no special mission.</p>

<p>Accused Gynecology Doctor: Not a Grandson of Cai Xiaoxiang. Yesterday's newspaper reported that Chen Jiangshi from Wuxi accused gynecology doctors Cai Songchun and Cai Bochun, claiming that the defendants were grandsons of the famous Jiangwan doctor Cai Xiaoxiang. However, Songchun and Bochun are sons of Cai Yousheng and not grandsons of Cai Xiaoxiang. Cai Xiaoxiang's lineage only has one descendant, Cai Xiangsun, and he is still studying and has not yet practiced medicine. Mr. Cai Xiangsun currently has a clinic at Lao Zha Bridge Alley and is unrelated to the accused Cai Songchun and Bochun.</p>
<p>Wu Xiahu Asks Fellow Villagers to Help with Disaster Relief. Ganpu in western Zhejiang has suffered a severe drought, leaving nine out of ten homes empty. The situation is unbearable. Last winter, Mr. Lu Bohong from Shanghai and Mr. Zhou Shuyuan and others organized river dredging and relief efforts, allowing the victims to barely survive. Now, Wu Xiahu, Chen Jicheng, and others, knowing that the autumn harvest is far off and spring relief is urgently needed, have written to Mr. Zhou Xinbo to ask fellow villagers to provide assistance. The main idea is to provide work relief through road construction, such as building the North-South Lake Avenue, which could increase tourism and slightly improve the local economy.</p>
<p>National Products Manufacturers Association: Representatives Returning to Shanghai from Anhui Yesterday. Shaoxing National Products Exhibition Opened the Day Before Yesterday. The Shanghai Chinese National Products Manufacturers Association, previously entrusted by the Anhui Provincial Government to collect national product manufacturers for an exhibition along the Wuhu-Tunxi Road in Anhui, sent Secretary Zhou Lin to Anhui to investigate the market conditions along the Wuhu-Tunxi Road to arrange the exhibition venue and schedule the opening.

<p>Jiangshan: The Tragic Situation of Disaster Victims Digging Fern Roots for Food. A Congee Kitchen is Being Set Up. Charitable Donations are Requested.

<p>A Fatal Case Caused by Estranged Friends. Chen Sanshun Beated Tian Heqing to Death. Sentenced to Three Years and Six Months in Prison. Tian Heqing, a Tongzhou native who lived at 23 Shijia Lane, Xuejia Ham, Nanshi, and worked as a pushcart driver, and Chen Sanshun, a fellow villager and colleague who lived at 4 Dexing Lane, Laiyi Wharf, were close friends. Last year, Tian Heqing owed Chen Sanshun ten yuan in membership fees, and Chen repeatedly asked for it, but Tian kept postponing. Finally, Tian Heqing promised to repay the full amount on the 26th of the lunar December, but he failed to pay a single cent when the date arrived. A conflict arose, and people dispersed them. After Chen Sanshun returned home, he became increasingly angry. In the end, deep friendship could not overcome money. The next morning, Chen Sanshun rushed to Tian's house and spoke rudely. Their past friendship was gone. Tian Heqing was also unwilling to back down. They first argued verbally and then physically, grappling with each other. As a result, Chen Sanshun landed a heavy blow, hitting Tian's ear. Tian suffered a fatal injury and died that evening. Afterward, the police arrested the perpetrator Chen Sanshun and sent him to the local court for interrogation. The court sent personnel to verify that Tian Heqing had indeed died from the injury. The prosecutor filed charges with the criminal court. After the trial concluded, Judge Guan Liting announced in open court yesterday at 10:00 AM that Chen Sanshun was guilty of causing death by injury and was sentenced to three years and six months in prison and ordered to pay 200 yuan in compensation. The plaintiff's other claims were dismissed. Chen Sanshun was dissatisfied with the verdict and can appeal according to law. He was ordered to be taken back into custody pending further instructions.</p>

<p>Special Article: Jin Cheng Bank 1934 Annual Report</p>
<p>1. Introduction. As time flows like a river, our bank, Jin Cheng, has been established for eighteen years. Looking back to the initial operating conditions, the amounts of receipts and payments were only over six million seven hundred and twenty thousand yuan, but now it is over one hundred and seventy-one million five hundred and eighty thousand yuan. This is all thanks to the trust of society, which has allowed our business to progress with each year. We are truly delighted. Banks serve society, and with the evolution of the social economy, the paths of their services must adapt to the needs of the times and adopt appropriate strategies. Therefore, the domestic and international economic situation has a significant impact on the operation of our banking industry. Over these eighteen years, our bank has witnessed numerous changes in the domestic and international economy. Fortunately, with the guidance of the shareholders and the cooperation of our colleagues, we have proceeded steadily and have been able to contribute modestly to social undertakings. However, in the year 1934, the strengthening of economic blocs, the materialization of inflation, the intensification of international trade, and the prevalence of currency wars abroad, as well as the poor agricultural harvests, the decline of industry, the recession of trade, and the outflow of cash domestically, were all quite severe. Although our bank has strived to maintain stability, it has still made progress. The total net profit of all branches for the year was over eight hundred and thirty thousand yuan. Although the amount is small, the economic conditions at home and abroad, the work of our bank, and its efforts in serving society must be disclosed to our shareholders. In previous annual shareholders' meetings, in addition to distributing the operating summary of each year, the distribution of surplus profit report, the balance sheet of assets and liabilities, and the overall profit and loss statement, the other sections were mostly announced in person during the meeting. There may be shortcomings. Therefore, the aforementioned economic environment and the overview of the bank's business operations are explained in detail in this document for your reference. We hope you will review it carefully.</p>
<p>2. Overview of Domestic and International Economy in 1934. A. International Economic Overview. In recent years, the policies of various countries to revive their economies can be roughly divided into three categories: (1) Countries of the gold bloc that advocate maintaining the gold standard and restoring free trade to revive the world economy, with France as the backbone, and Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, etc. belonging to this group. (2) Non-gold bloc countries that advocate abandoning the gold standard, inflating currency, and raising prices to restore world economic prosperity, which can be further divided into the sterling bloc (represented by the United Kingdom, Denmark, Sweden, and Canada), the dollar bloc (represented by the United States), and the yen bloc (with Japan as the backbone). (3) The policies of the Soviet Union and other countries differ, so the extent to which they are affected by the economic panic also varies. For the sake of convenience, we are willing to explore the general situation of the world economy this year (1934) in terms of finance, prices, production, unemployment, and trade in three categories of countries: (1) gold bloc, (2) non-gold bloc, and (3) Soviet Union. (1) Gold Bloc Countries. When describing the economic situation of the so-called gold bloc countries, France is the leader, with Belgium, Italy, and the Netherlands belonging to this group. In recent years, these countries have been under pressure from the policies of non-gold bloc countries, and their economic situation has deteriorated. Although they rely on implementing fiscal austerity, restricting imports, encouraging production, and postponing war debts to maintain cash and overcome difficulties, the situation is deteriorating, and it is difficult to reverse the tide. Their economic recovery is far behind that of non-gold bloc countries. Let us briefly describe their situation in terms of finance, prices, production, unemployment, business closures, and trade. (1) Finance. In terms of finance, (1) the trend of financial tightness can be seen from the rise and fall of the central bank's discount rate. In 1934, the central bank's discount rate in gold bloc countries, except for Italy, was higher than in 1931. Taking France as an example to illustrate the general situation, the discount rate in France averaged 2.11% in 1931, rising to 2.5% in 1932 and 1933, and further to 2.63% in 1934. From February to April of that year, it even rose to 3.00%. (2) Banknote issuance and cash reserves. In 1934, the banknote issuance amount in gold bloc countries increased slightly compared to 1933, but it was lower than in 1931 and 1932. As for cash reserves, in the first half of this year, France's gold outflow was affected by the US gold purchase policy. In February, it suddenly decreased from 77,055 million francs in January to 73,971 million francs. It gradually increased afterward, and only increased to 82,124 million francs by the end of the year. The gold reserves of the other three countries have been consistently decreasing since the beginning of this year, so they are all less than in 1933. At the end of 1934, the gold reserves of France and Italy were more than in 1931, which was actually due to the recovery of foreign deposits and short-term loans, not due to trade gains. (3) In terms of exchange rates, the exchange rate of Paris against foreign currencies can be used as a representative. Since the pound, yen, and dollar have successively depreciated, the exchange rate of the franc against foreign currencies has been increasing, putting it at a disadvantage. The parity between the pound and the franc was originally 124.12 francs equal to one pound. Since the United Kingdom abandoned the gold standard in 1931, the annual average exchange rate of Paris against London increased to 115.63 francs that year. In 1932, it further increased to 89.20 francs. In 1933, it increased to 84.59 francs, and in 1934, it further increased to 76.72 francs. The parity between the franc and the dollar was originally 25.52 francs for one dollar. Before the United States abandoned the gold standard in March 1933, the average exchange rate of Paris against New York was 25.51 francs in 1931 and 25.46 francs in 1932. In 1933, due to the dollar's depreciation, the average exchange rate for the year increased to 20.57 francs, and in 1934, it further increased to 15.22 francs. Needless to say, such a situation has greatly disadvantaged France's export trade. (4) In terms of stock index, the French stock index (1929=100) can be used as a representative. It has also seen a sharp decline in recent years. It was 85.75 in 1930, decreased to 60.75 in 1931, further decreased to 48.35 in 1932, 45.77 in 1933, and the average in 1934 had fallen to 39.15, a decrease of more than 60 points compared to 1929. The high exchange rate and the decline in prices, production, and trade are all reasons for the sharp drop in stock prices. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Free Talk: Helen's Chastity by Ling Mo. The Iliad started the great works of the West, and Helen, in it, depicted the first typical Western woman. Perhaps we can regard Helen as the shadow of Venus, perhaps from Helen, Venus was later imagined to have such a beautiful and enchanting personality. In Andre Gide's "World's Desire" (translated by Zhou Zuoren, "Lost History of the Red Star"), it is written that Helen became the god Sohar in Egypt after her death, which is simply written as the goddess of beauty, so it is natural to have this view. The Helen scene in the second part of Goethe's Faust can also be seen in the same way. From a Chinese perspective, the fate of the typical beauty given by the writer is quite difficult to understand. We probably have to recognize her encounters as unfortunate, and feel that the poet is writing about the fragility of beauty. But the tragedy of Troy, the tragedy is not at all on Helen's side. Helen running away with Paris is not necessarily an unfortunate encounter, and this does not necessarily give Helen an unfortunate ending. Of course, there is a story that after the fall of Troy, Helen was killed on the ship that Menelaus took her back to Sparta, as an example of a woman who lost her chastity. This is quite similar to the story recorded in Chinese books about Xi Shi being drowned in the river after the Yue state governed Wu. This cold-blooded writing is obviously not something that most people can sympathize with. Even in China, in the era when cold-blooded morality was not fully developed, it was not generally recognized. Therefore, there is another legend that Xi Shi traveled around the Five Lakes with Fan Li. And Westerners will naturally have other explanations for Helen's ending. The combination of Helen and Paris is obviously a matter beyond morality, which can be interpreted as a symbol of the combination of beauty and beauty, so the combination can be said to be ideal. Similarly, in another story, Helen is combined with Achilles, forming a typical hero and beauty. In "World's Desire," she is combined with Odysseus, which is the harmony of beauty and wisdom. And in Faust, she is combined with Faust, which is a further step to harmonize beauty with modern wisdom. They can all be said to regard these combinations as more important than morality. This ideal is beyond morality. The ideal of later generations is certainly not necessarily Homer's original intention. But Homer did not necessarily think about chastity, which seems to be no doubt. The Trojans did not regard Helen as the cause of the war, but were happy to fight for beauty. On the Greek side, the cause of the war was less about revenge than about fulfilling the old alliance to jointly protect the beauty. Neither side ever thought of punishing Helen. To resolve a major event with the life of a woman, to have a woman take responsibility for an event, is too cowardly, not something that can be allowed in the character of a hero. In this situation, the heroine herself does not need to feel that she has the responsibility to resolve this event. This is not a very strange ideal, and this spirit is often written in later Western literature. I am afraid that this is ultimately difficult for us to thoroughly understand. In our stories of love struggles—if there are enough things to be called struggles—the result is often that women perform tragedies. The woman herself does not feel that the performance of this tragedy is too unworthy; the man does not feel that this is his shame. Society is also accustomed to it and has no feeling; or it can be said that it simply holds this requirement. Emperor Xuanzong of Tang strangled Consort Yang to appease the public anger. Later, didn't a poet write a poem praising, "I have not heard of the Shang and Zhou dynasties, but since then sisters-in-law have been killed"? I don't know what Westerners think of the story of Yang Guifei, at least they will not think that Emperor Xuanzong of Tang understands love! Without talking about the view that women are the cause of disasters, there is a question in itself. Some people in China have also made the indignation of "If Xi Shi understood that she would destroy the country, who would destroy the Yue state?" Even if it is really a cause of disaster, then like Emperor Yang of Sui's persistence to the death, at least it has some spirit. There is a section in the Hall of Eternal Life that writes a tune about Emperor Ming's remorseful psychology: "If I am willing to go to resist, he may not directly offend the emperor! Even if he offends, what does it matter? In the spring, I can get eternal couple." It reveals the cowardice of Emperor Ming. Further expanding, it is not only Emperor Ming who is cowardly. Chen Yuanli and the six armies cannot resist An Lushan like the Trojans fought the Greeks. Following the emperor to flee to Sichuan, they would demand a woman's death to vent their anger, which is really too "deflating" (collapse in Beijing dialect).</p>
<p>Small Shop by Zigang. At the corner of the small street, you can't see the tall restaurant, but there are three or four small restaurants facing each other from north to south. They are all earthen halls, with benches and tables of indistinguishable colors. There is no stove in winter, but fortunately, there are coal stoves to keep the guests warm. Here, customers have the freedom to supervise the staff in cooking. They can often say: "Hey, I'm a regular customer, why is it still so thin?" "Don't be stingy with the oil!" At noon, these doorways are crowded with rickshaws and sedan carriers. The rickshaws are empty. The people inside devouring food are not the passengers, but the owners of the rickshaws - the owners who rent it out for fifty or sixty coins a day. They each remember the shape of their car clearly and will never make a mistake. They only need to keep an eye on it slightly when they are hunched over the table, squinting, and devouring cornbread and gray noodles to prevent someone with bad intentions from dragging someone else's away. Occasionally, there is a bicycle leaning against the door. It is a newspaper vendor or a shop assistant. Everyone will glance at him a few more times. The rickshaw pullers sigh: "That harmful thing, how many jobs has it ruined for us?" "I chased one once, but it wasn't much worse, damn it!" But some are also envious: "If I were younger, I would learn it and earn more money as a messenger?" Another group of people are hawkers. The vegetable carts are also parked outside. If the shopkeeper is willing, he will take a few vegetables in exchange for lunch. There are many shoulder poles, carrying eggs, radishes, and old goods. Only the owners of these identical poles can clearly recognize their own belongings. They talk about today's highest and lowest selling prices. If they make a profit, they will happily order three or two liang of sorghum wine, which is admired by their companions. However, this situation does not happen often. Many thick hearts still remember the mouths at home. Touching the full purse seems to be a comforting thing for their wives and children. Second-hand goods dealers often take this opportunity to show off their harvests, such as: a short cotton-padded jacket, a small pit table, an old oil lamp... They raise the price of their purchases a little and then say to the group of fiery eyes: "Who wants to trade? I am willing to sell at the original price, it's cheap!" "We brothers are righteous, I am willing to sell at a loss for my brothers!" Even if it's not true, warm words will grab customers. Occasionally, there are also times when a deal is made. The patrol police at the street corner also come to eat. The staff greets them kindly as if recognizing a godfather, and they busy hanging the hat with the police badge on the wall. But here, the "gentlemen" take off their fierce faces, satisfied with the flattery, and chat with the shopkeeper. The rickshaw pullers also forget his police baton and dare to chat with him. People here all become partners, without any pretense. The bills are also calculated separately, and the brothers do not disturb each other. It wasn't until the afternoon sun began to slant that people became sparse, and the signboard "Private Rooms Available" fluttered outside the door.</p>
<p>Dog by Chen Fuxi. I hate dogs. The godmother's family has a Pekinese dog. Every time I go, I see it; but as soon as I see it, it often makes me trace back to A Yin, who was forgotten in my memory. I really hate dogs. Dogs seem to be my enemy. Seeing a dog, a resentful hostility, inevitably appears in my heart. Although I hate them, there will be a female dog that I always consider pitiful, and that is A Yin. In my memory, A Yin is always so gentle, docile, and has a white coat. She is female, and every winter, she has a litter. Under the eaves, in the dark alley, a few straws or half a broken reed mat is her place to give birth. Each time she gives birth, there are seven or eight at most, and at least three; but the dogs she gives birth to are never seen raised well. Those dogs are often caught a month after birth. She can't see her children, so she walks sadly in the street all day long, from east to west, howling fiercely at strangers. She is sad, having lost her children... The puppies sleep in their mother's arms, some with mottled colors, some all black, some yellow, and some white; some are sleeping, some are suckling, and some are "woofing," which is really beautiful. I remember one year, A Yin was giving birth in the alley of my house. I went in and out of this alley every morning and evening, always looking into the dog kennel to see if the puppies could crawl and if their eyes had opened. But one day, when I went to look at the dog kennel as usual, I suddenly found that all the puppies were gone. The dog kennel was just dirty, empty, and without any sound. "Ah! Where did the puppies go?" I was surprised. The innocent childhood heart seemed to feel the sadness of losing a friend. Running out of the alley, not far from my house, I suddenly saw A Yin, confused, walking with such slow steps. Her melancholic, sad form made me think of the fate of those puppies even more. Yes, so young, they can't even walk fast, how can they leave their mother? Moreover, they are used to sleeping in their mother's arms, sucking on her round breasts, so warm, sweet, and happy. Now that they have left the dog kennel, how will they live? I was stunned. "All the dogs raised by A Yin have been caught!" I said. "Don't they still need to suckle?" "Yes! Their eyes have only just opened..." "What a sin! What a sin!" Mother was also very sad. Therefore, whenever I walked on the road, I would always meet A Yin, dragging her heavy, full breasts, walking slowly, slowly. That appearance was not as happy as before giving birth, but became very decadent. She knew that the children she gave birth to could not be raised, and she also knew that each birth was a suffering; but she would always give birth around October, and each time she gave birth, she always hoped that her children would be raised big and fat, able to walk, able to guard the house, and able to find food, but her hopes were only shattered. Three days after A Yin's puppies disappeared, I accidentally found a dead puppy next to the Guandi Temple. The puppy's fetal hair and appearance, at a glance, I knew: - that was A Yin's child. "Oh! A small life is over..." The other few who may have suffered the same fate also floated into my mind at the same time. I walked, quickly approaching my own doorstep, but I met A Yin; I saw her depressed, walking with sluggish steps, towards the lonely dog kennel.</p>
<p>—War Notes (1) by Tokunaga Sunao, translated by Ye Yin.</p>
<p>(1) At that time, I was only seven years old, so naturally I wouldn't understand why the Russo-Japanese War was fought, nor would I understand what kind of oppression and humiliation Russia had inflicted on Japan, that the Japanese government had to make the people rise up in such a way, and was not afraid to let the corpses of tens of thousands of compatriots be exposed on the Manchurian grasslands. "The Russian devils are very bad, the red beards are very bad." It was only because the village chief and the chairman of the veterans association used such words to make the villagers, especially the young people, rise up, so everyone said so; so it came to the point that even we children shouted with that tongue that couldn't be rolled over: "The red beard of the Russian devils, Kuropatkin." "What bird, you Russian devil..." - As a result, it became one of the cursing words that could fully insult the other party by just saying it. This was one day's thing. The weather wasn't bad; but in the middle of two or three days, my father showed an unhappy look, not doing things, just running around at the nearby relatives' houses (father was a short-term worker, he didn't have any skilled profession). This day, he and his uncle, grandfather, etc., two or three people, started drinking wine near the narrow door frame of the house. Mother was still wearing that ragged clothing, making gurgling sounds from her nose, pouring wine. That kind of scene was completely unprecedented for me. Father usually didn't drink wine, let alone have his mother pouring wine. Indeed, this kind of situation had never been seen before. I sat blankly at the door of the plank looking at them, not knowing why, my grandfather took my hand with many wrinkles and pulled me to my father at the door frame. So my sister, who was playing with me, also showed a crying face, following me. So, my father showed a completely different look from usual, touching my head, wanting to say something; but I didn't hear it. "Dad is going to fight, play honestly - okay, do you know?..." Grandfather said this from the side, teaching me to nod. I understood: "Father is going to crusade against the Russian devils." There was no sadness of separating from my father in my heart at all. It was just because my father didn't have a sword or a gun, I always felt it was a bit lacking. After two or three days, my father was not at home. Probably early in the morning when we were still sleepy or at night, he went to fight. "Mom, where is the place to fight?" At night, mother lay in the middle: after lying down, my older sister, who was two years older than me, had asked mother this way. Since father left, mother was afraid of spending too much lamp oil, so as soon as she finished the evening's work, she immediately locked the door and made the bed. The youngest brother was held by mother, followed by my sister, next to my sister was my older sister, and I was behind mother. "The war is very far away, in a place called Manchuria!" But was Manchuria on the west side of our house, or the east side? It seemed that even mother didn't know. "Is it on that side? Or this side?" When my older sister pointed and asked, mother couldn't give a definite answer. Mother was a resolute woman. Leading four children, although life was very hard, it wasn't to the point of running out of food.</p>
<p>翰林進士都是不通的寶員 [Hanlin Scholars and Jinshi are all Useless Treasures] (3) by Cao Juren. In the past, those who obtained fame in the imperial examinations might have had a few outstanding talents with strong memories who could recite the Four Books and one or two classics, and write a few essays and test poems, which was already extraordinary. The rest of the enthusiasts mostly relied on "connections," "cheating," and "substitution" to get in. I once bought a foot-and-a-half square fine handkerchief in Suzhou with tiny, ant-like characters of essays, almost sixty or seventy thousand words. To cheat like this for fame, it is clear how stupid they are. Other cheating tools, such as the inch-square Five Classics and Four Books, the essay treasury, the classic collection, all made me breathless. In the past, people who used such improper methods to obtain fame, still have the face to be proud to the youth, thinking themselves knowledgeable and capable of writing, is simply "shameless"!

<p>Business News Finance  Rumors Fuel Selling Pressure  Spot Gold Rises and Falls  ——Returns to 864.00——  Yesterday, the gold market initially tightened due to the sharp decline in US cotton prices.  As soon as the foreign exchange market opened, it rose, but unexpectedly, rumors favored selling. Sassoon and Jardine Matheson dumped sterling, which dampened the upward momentum.  Later, sentiment gradually softened, resulting in a decline. The market situation continued to be peaceful in the afternoon, with a predominantly bullish trend.  Early in the morning, due to the upcoming closure, overseas silver markets surged after being squeezed.  Silver prices for forward contracts fluctuated, and exchange rates narrowed.  London spot gold rose slightly by half a penny.  Sentiment stabilized as the foreign exchange market tightened in the morning.  Off-market trading opened at 877-878, higher than before the closure, but slightly lower than the previous day's informal trading.  Buying interest was strong, with Hang Yue, Fu Yue, and Yongli actively participating, pushing the price up to 881-882.  Taifa Yong, Hang Yue, Hengchang Yong, and Fu Yue took advantage of the high prices to sell, retreating to 877-878.  The Central Bank announced its exchange rates, with the pound unchanged against the dollar, and the dollar slightly lower.  Customs duties rose by one mill, but had little impact.  After the opening, the price briefly broke through the 880 barrier.  Rumors of unfavorable news, such as the establishment of loans, suddenly emerged, fueling selling pressure and causing a downstream decline.  However, it was easy to rebound after the low, and the market remained stagnant for quite some time without much change.  Unfortunately, Sassoon and Jardine Matheson continued to dump sterling, causing the foreign exchange market to harden and sentiment to gradually waver.  At the noon closing, there were many who took advantage of the low prices to cover their short positions, providing support and ultimately presenting a stagnant situation. The market situation for the morning is recorded below.  The morning opening was at 877.50, an increase of 1.60 from before the closure.

Yingxiang, Fu Yue, Wan Xing, Yongli, Hengchang Yong, and Chunyuan Yong, although entering at 3.80, could not overcome the weakening sentiment, and many parties sold. Hang Yue, Qian Changxiang, Taifa Yong, Wan Xing, Shunli, Fu'an, Dada, Yingxiang, Yongli, and Si Tai Chang and others eagerly closed out their positions, breaking through the 70 barrier and falling to 68.

Sassoon Sells Sterling  The Pound and Dollar Tighten Before Loosening  According to foreign news reports yesterday, London bulk transactions were flat for both near and far contracts.

New York silver was slightly down by 125, and forward silver prices were unchanged or down by 5 points. London spot gold fell by 10 pence. The pound against the dollar fell by 3.5 points, the dollar against the pound fell by 2.25 points, the pound against the French franc fell by 40 pounds, and the dollar against the French franc fell by 25.

The Central Bank announced its exchange rates, with the pound unchanged and the dollar down by 125. Customs gold units rose by 1 yuan, but had little impact. After the opening, rumors of successful loan negotiations caused a shift from tightness to looseness. HSBC announced its exchange rates, with the pound unchanged and the dollar down by 25. This was all due to small exchange rate adjustments and had little impact. However, the situation was still acceptable at this point. Later, Sassoon dumped sterling again, and the process hardened. Banks' appetite for buying and selling varied. Chinese merchants finally couldn't support it and sold off their positions. The trend was even looser at noon. Near the noon closing, short-term selling prices were 1 shilling 7.375 pence for the pound and 38.3125 yuan for the dollar, which was looser for the pound by 1875 and tighter for the dollar by 125 compared to the previous close. Chinese merchants initially bought and then sold, slightly favoring the selling side. Sassoon and Jardine Matheson sold sterling aggressively, and Mainland Shanghai and other places sold US dollars.

The financial market situation in recent days has been marked by the shockwaves of the end of the year, and there is still a sense of unease. Therefore, most people are cautious and conservative, seeking only to maintain the status quo. As a result, the market situation is sluggish. Yesterday morning and afternoon, foreign exchange swaps remained at 8 points, with no change from the previous day. There was no premium added to the swaps. There was still no progress in the trading of swap tickets. It is estimated that more than 2.7 million was transferred in the morning market, more than 500,000 in new transactions, more than 300,000 in the afternoon market, more than 400,000 in the Small General Association, more than 600,000 in foreign exchange pawn transactions, and more than 900,000 in new loans. According to bank collection and settlement information, foreign banks collected and settled more than 2 million in bills, more than 500,000 in telegraphic transfers, more than 700,000 in special remittances, and 300 in various goods and other settlements.

Auxiliary coins rose and fell differently.  Yesterday, Jiangnan small foreign coins suddenly rose by 8 yuan in the morning market to 845 yuan, but fell back by 6 yuan in the afternoon market to 839 yuan. As a result, it only rose by 2 yuan compared to the previous day. The trading volume was 10,000 in the morning market and 4,000 in the afternoon market. Guangdong small foreign coins were listed at 732.50 yuan in the morning market, and slightly lower by 1 point in the afternoon market, changing to 732.40 yuan.

Securities  23 Customs Bonds Uniquely Good by 3 Points  Other Bonds Unanimously Hovered and Weakened  Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange's market actually trended towards hovering and weakening. Trading on the market also turned sluggish, which was indeed affected by the dull environment. In each transaction, there were always one or two types that could not be opened. The 19 Consolidation Bond for this month did not open all day. Based on this speculation, the bulls were still technically holding, so the shorts did not dare to sell aggressively. Although the No. 4 bond has stopped selling, the market atmosphere is still not active, and there are quite a few retail investors selling. However, the 21 and 22 Customs Bonds once again stood out from the crowd. When various bond markets rebounded, the 23 Customs Bond gradually rose slightly, indicating that the 23 Customs Bond has not yet returned to normal since the previous surge and crash. The trend of various bonds cannot be separated from hovering for the time being. The whole day passed from morning to dusk, with a total of four transactions. The first three transactions mostly hovered and weakened, with a slight firming at the close. However, the 23 Customs Bond rose slightly in each transaction. Although the number was limited, the trend was quite consistent, or there may be an abnormal development again. Therefore, its daily result was a unique increase of 6 points, and the forward contract was also good by 2 points and 5 points, with a significant short squeeze. Other various bonds weakened, ranging from 5 points and 1 point to about 3 and 4 points. The total transaction volume was 5,695,000 yuan. The results of the increases and decreases are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).

The reasons for the stock market decline are: 1. The cotton market situation is chaotic. The cotton market experienced another sharp decline at noon, but stabilized somewhat in the afternoon. 2. The public gradually believes that the government will continue to avoid inflating the currency, so they sell gold and silver stocks. 3. President Roosevelt's message to Congress requested the prohibition of public securities companies. 4. Steel production decreased. 5. The sharp decline in cotton prices may reduce the purchasing power of Southern farmers. The bond market was slightly mixed, with domestic corporate bonds being the exception. They declined under the leadership of railways, because railways will restore the previously reduced 5% wage starting on April 1st. This is a very heavy burden for some railways, causing the public to sell off. The small exchange market was also weak. Chicago wheat was affected by the chaos in the cotton market, and sentiment was unstable with little fluctuation. The total transaction volume for the day was 1.05 million shares. The Dow Jones index is listed on the left.  March 11 March 12 Change from Previous Day  30 Industrial Stocks 99.39 97.55 Down 1.73  20 Railroad Stocks 27.92 27.31 Down 0.67  20 Utility Stocks 15.33 15.03 Down 0.30  40 Bonds 95.40 94.99 Down 0.41  11 Items 55.82 55.49 Down 0.33 Cotton Yarn  US Cotton Telegrams Still Report Declines  Disappointed with Floating Profits and Closeouts  The yarn market continued to decline, and the situation gradually showed signs of weakening. The overseas cotton yarn situation became increasingly bleak, and sentiment was affected. However, one major player's long position remained unchanged, so the market decline could still be supported. The need for spot yarn was slightly weaker, and foreign merchants did not replenish their short positions. According to market rumors, Ningbo Hefeng Factory has 2,000 pieces of 20-count Dutch Bee yarn to be delivered.  Golden Rooster Fell Again  At the opening of the spot yarn market, prices for all months fell. Because overseas cotton telegrams still reported declines, sentiment was increasingly frustrated. Long positions were closed out in concentration, and the market was flooded with sales. The more it was auctioned, the weaker it became in the afternoon. As a result, all months fell by 0.69 to 1.24 yuan. The opening in the afternoon was still flat. When auctioned to 2, the distant months were slightly higher. Profiteers bought short positions. It was heard that spot yarn was still in high demand. As a result, the near months fell by 0.3 yuan and the distant months rose by 0.23 yuan. It was found that the sellers included Dafeng 1,950 bales, Yida 800 bales, Junchang 1,750 bales, Renfeng 1,700 bales, Taichang 650 bales, and Changfeng 1,250 bales.  850 bales, Mei Fei 700 bales. Buyers included Tongji 1,000 bales, Dafu 2,600 bales, Jin Chang 3,050 bales, Hexing 1,550 bales, Shen Chang 1,000 bales, Gengfeng 2,300 bales, Hengde 900 bales, and Yuanyi 800 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:  Spot Yarn Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Change from Previous Day Number of Unsettled Accounts  March 179.9 178.8 178.9 Down 0.90 32,250  April 180.9 179.6 180.1 0.90 48,400  May 181.7 180.4 181.0 1.10 46,650  June 182.2 180.9 181.6 1.10 36,300  July 182.7 181.5 182.1 1.00 35,400  August 183.2 182.1 182.5 1.20 19,500  Total 218,500  Slight Decrease in Yarn Sales  Spot yarn sales are still good, but less than the previous day. It was found that all gangs bought a total of 1,450 bales for the day. The market was flat and weak. The amount of purchases by each gang is as follows:  Tianjin 105 Jiangxi 150 Mainland 90 Weihai 120  Guangdong 395 Changsha 105 Wuhu 35 Sichuan 80  Henan 20 Ningbo 40 Shantou 30 Nanyang 30  Xiamen 15 Peers 20  The cotton market is still weak, and the downward trend is particularly strong. In fact, the US cotton news is not good. Most people in Shanghai expected a possible rebound yesterday, but the telegrams still showed a decline, causing great disappointment to the bulls. The gold market fell, and many floating positions were closed out. The market continued to fall, but Tongcheng Company made up for a lot of profits. Japanese merchants sold off in large quantities, estimated to be tens of thousands of dans.  Zheng Standard Falls 34 Points  At the opening of the standard cotton market, all months fell, and the situation was unusually panicked. People's hearts were flustered, because most people expected US cotton to rebound and rise, but the telegrams still fell by 5 pounds, and Indian cotton fell by 11 rupees. The long positions were greatly disappointed, and the market showed weakness. The selling pressure became stronger and stronger, and all months fell by 2, 3, and 4 points and a half. The opening in the afternoon was flat, and Tongcheng Company made up for losses in the second and third auctions. Retail investors saw good news from US cotton tomorrow and bought more tightly. However, Japanese merchants sold off again at the close, and the market loosened. The closing price for each month rebounded by 5 points to 1 point. It was found that Changfeng sold 9,100 dans, Dafu 3,000 dans, Tongji 2,900 dans, Gengfeng 2,100 dans, Changyu 2,300 dans, Tongxing 3,600 ancestors, Xinting 2,700 dans, Changhe 9,600 dans, and Yifeng 1,500 dans. Jifeng bought 4,500 dans, Jinchang 5,000 dans, Hexing 3,700 dans, Changji 3,200 dans, Shengyuan 3,800 dans, Yongda 3,000 dans, Yuanxing Chang 7,600 dans, and Dafu 2,400 dans. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:  Standard Cotton Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Rise and Fall Number of Accounts  March 34.00 23.75 33.85 Down 0.35 62,500  April 34.35 34.10 34.35 0.10 120,700  May 34.25 34.05 34.20 0.30 148,700  June 34.50 34.30 34.35 0.35 144,00  July 34.90 34.75 34.80 0.40 140,100  August 34.85 34.70 30.80 0.35 56,700  Total 672,700  The Need for Raw Cotton Mills is Becoming Even More Scarce  Spot cotton consumption is becoming increasingly stagnant. Because the US and Indian cotton markets are creating the lowest prices in a year and a half, the exchange price is approaching daily. Dafeng Factory entered Pingguoer at 31.50 yuan and 500 pieces, sent to the factory, and the source was Yaohua 200 bales.  Tongzhou Cotton 42.00 Shenxin Factory Entered 500 Bales Spot Goods Sent to the Factory  Dongtai Cotton 41.00 Shenxin Factory Entered 500 Bales Spot Goods Sent to the Factory The US Cotton Situation is Chaotic  English and Indian Follow US Cotton and Also Plunge  Yesterday, the US cotton market opened. Although the Liverpool news was relatively firm, brokers, Liverpool, the Mainland Gang, and the Far East Gang all sold off unanimously. At the same time, there were also sellers in the distant months. All months fell by 3 to 13 points. Afterwards, because of rumors that the government's agricultural policy would not change, the public bought in, and the market price suddenly changed. Unfortunately, sentiment was unstable, and the bulls painfully closed out their positions, and the downward trend started again. The market was quieter in the afternoon. Spot cotton was bleak, and factories withdrew orders. On the basis of the corner, because of waiting for a 1.2% loan, it was still considered stable. The closing was flat and weak. Spot cotton fell by 5 points, and futures fell by 1 to 7 points. English cotton softened with the US cotton decline of the previous day. Spot cotton fell by 37 points, and futures fell by 42 points. Indian cotton was weak due to futures traders selling and long positions closing out. Pingguoer fell by 6.25 rupees, Olaum fell by 10.25 rupees, and Bairoxi fell by 11.5 rupees.

Recent Overview of Cotton Industry in Shandong Province  Cotton Plunges Due to Stagnant Demand Yarn Sales Active and Uniquely Rise  (Jinan Correspondent) The cotton market situation in Shandong Province, due to the panic in Shanghai's financial markets and Shenxin Factory stopping purchases, presents a dismal decline in prices. Recently, fine velvet cotton has fallen straight from 70 yuan per bale to 41-42 yuan, and there are few transactions. It has become a situation where there is no market to go to. There has been a recent recovery. The most prosperous cotton yarn sales are those of Shandong Lufeng Factory's 17-count yarn. According to surveys, Jinan City's current cotton stock reaches 140,000 bales. Most cotton merchants have suffered greatly from this blow, and many have suffered unbearable losses. There are four cotton yarn factories in Jinan: Lufeng, Chengtong, Renhou, and De. According to their need for raw materials, the annual amount is more than 180,000 dans, and the cotton yarn production is more than 53,000 pieces. During this period of spring sales, it is becoming increasingly active, and it is not affected by the decline in cotton prices or the economic panic in Shanghai. Gai Lu yarn is widely sold in various counties in the province, and at this time of spring leisure, most farmers are devoted to weaving cloth, so purchases have increased sharply. Shanghai yarn to Lu is  Not cost-effective, combined with Yarn production A great opportunity, prices are rising. Food  The Ending of Spot Flour is Near Weak and Far Firm  After the opening of the flour market in the morning, prices for each month showed a trend of rising first and then falling. The quotation for foreign wheat, Chicago, had a fluctuation of 1.3 points, Canada was slightly smaller at 1.0 point. When the opening price was given, because the gold price turned up and the previous day's decline was too much, sentiment became active again. Therefore, general short positions were covered one after another. As for this month, the current flour is still tight and needs to be squeezed, and the standard needs to be increased by 5 points. Therefore, people's hearts are stable, and it is about 1 point better than the previous day. By noon, the opening price was still stable at first, and then small households with long positions came out and sold off distant contracts exclusively. The market atmosphere was frustrated. As for this month, another ship of foreign wheat fixed by various factories arrived yesterday and was docked at floating piers 4 and 5. It was also heard that two or three more ships will arrive in mid-May, so although the current flour is popular now, it will be difficult to stay high in the future. Therefore, people's hearts have returned to normal. As a result, this month was slightly lower by half a point, April and May were slightly lower by 2.5%, June was slightly higher by 2.5%, and July and August were higher by half a point. The forward wheat market was slightly more active.  After the opening of yesterday's forward wheat market in the morning, prices for each month showed an unusually quiet trend. The quotation for foreign wheat, Chicago, had a fluctuation of 1.0 point, Canada was slightly smaller at 1.0 point. When the opening price was given, although foreign wheat was slightly lower, the gold price rose, so both sides refused each other. Only August gave an opening price, and the rest</p>
