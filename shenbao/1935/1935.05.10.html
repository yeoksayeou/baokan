<h3 id="c29">法蘇協定與遠東關係 <a href="#c29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>法國與蘇聯締定互助協約後。其在國際將有何影響。雖論者紛紜。莫衷一是。然而就遠東局勢言之。法國在遠東利害較鮮。卽欲有所作爲。亦鞭長英及。蘇聯則境跨歐亞。爲日本之正面敵人。世界列强之中在遠東有切膚利害者。中日以外。莫蘇聯若。且其在遠東之武力。素爲日本之隱憂。法蘇兩國在遠東利害旣輕重不同。其與日本之關係亦復相異。假使遠東一旦有事。其同床而異夢。蓋不待言。故協定談判之時。法國外交家於此層卽鰓鰓過慮。懼引起日本之反感。協定締結之日。雙方又正式聲明。此項互助不涉及歐洲以外之問題。約中文字。更明顯指出所對付者爲誰。意者日本之軍人及外交家可以高枕無憂。而法蘇協定之無關於遠東局勢。似亦不言而可喻矣。</p>
<p>吾人就協定之文字言。就法國之動機言。法蘇合作在對德而不在對日。固不待言。雖然。文字規定。與實行結果。往往不同。而一種動機往往可生多種可能之行動。吾人知蘇俄與日本。目前雖相安無事。但其根本衝突之因素。固至今存在。日蘇戰爭似亦遲早難免。假使戰爭爆發。法國將取何種態度耶。法國不願開罪日本。因其武力尚不足單獨保障安南之安全。頗爲明顯。然法國豈願開罪其同盟國。而在遠東之戰塲上攻擊其在歐洲之患難相共之友邦乎。法國外交之最大前提。爲保障其在歐陸之安全。換言之。卽在防止德國勢力之加强。而蘇聯勢力之削弱。卽德國勢力之增加。亦卽於法國之安全不利。法國能坐視蘇聯之敗績。而使所仇者快意乎。近者德日聯盟以對付法蘇聯盟之說。亦甚囂塵上。使德日夾攻而撲滅蘇聯。法國其能按兵不動耶。</p>
<p>此次法蘇協定。其性質頗有類於四十年前之法俄同盟。其目標同爲對德。其範圍均限於歐洲。使歷史隔代而重演。則日俄大戰。或將再度於法俄同盟締結後十餘年間爆發。前次日俄大戰。法國宣吿中立。此中原因。與其言法國無援助帝俄之條約義務。不如謂因爲有英日同盟之存在。一旦法國舉兵援。俄英國海軍可立卽封鎖法蘭西之海岸。然試檢討法國中立成績。亦頗耐人深味。據最近出版之前法國駐俄大使Paleologue君之備忘錄。日俄戰中。法國不避一切。予俄國艦隊以種種便利。侵犯國際法上中立國義務。而日本方面雖曾抗議。亦無效果。帝俄波羅的海艦隊之東航。沿途之地圖航綫。法國海軍當局實供給之。艦隊自好望角至法領馬達加斯加。在法國之海港中停泊六星期。水兵登陸操演。更東航而至安南。與俄國其他艦隊相會。食料及燃料等等。法國方面與以供給。凡此種種。皆國際法上所不許。而事實上英國固扶助日本於前。法國則援助帝俄於後。所謂嚴格中立。形存而實亡。三十年前之戰爭。猶有此種現象。降至今日。中立之權利與義務。已無嚴格之規定。就理論上言。法蘇均爲非戰公約之簽字國。國際聯盟之會員國。在此二大條約之下。中立頗不適用。就實際上言。英日同盟已不復存在。在未來日俄戰爭中。法國將間接的爲蘇俄助。蓋必然之趨勢也。</p>
<p>歐洲外交之一靜一動。與遠東局勢息息相關。吾人不能因法蘇恊定中明文規定此約之不涉及歐洲以外問題。而視爲歐陸一隅之事。然法蘇協定將促日俄戰爭之實現耶。抑延長遠東苟且之武裝和平耶。吾人以爲法國旣集中其注意力於中歐。自不願其同盟國在遠東用武。而分散其對德力量。同時日本鑒於蘇聯與法國之密切關係。與蘇聯作戰。恐法國之被逼而捲入。致範圍擴大。於日本爲不利。亦將更取愼重態度。蘇聯之外交。往往以强硬之外表。達到維持現局之目的。近且與東京商議東北邊境蘇聯駐軍之撤退矣。故今後蘇聯遠東政策。將集中於新疆蒙古附近勢力之培養。而不欲念圖一逞。此固日本之所願。亦法國之所希望者也。</p>

<h3 id="c201">暹邏敎育部長解釋　取締華校之荒謬聲明書 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>收回強迫班禁止敎授黨義　凌弱懼強對他國未加限制</p>
<p>暹邏敎育部長柏訕沙拉巴攀氏、因此次取締華校　施同化政策、引起華僑一致反對、紛紛提出質問、詎該部長竟強詞狡　、並印發解釋取締華校之聲明書、詞極荒謬、令人髮指、實業社記者特覓錄該項聲明書原文如下、</p>
<p>不願他國握敎育權</p>
<p>（一）敎育之　則、各國俱有完成其教育目標之主權、而不願他國人民任意私自有辦理教育之特權者、同理、中國亦如此暹邏亦如　、其同一公式、即將保存國內實施敎育之主權、不願讓僑（不論華僑或其他各國僑民有此種灶權者）、（二）暹國之教育實施法、經明白頒布、有關係實施敎育之法例、即（甲）（佛歷一四六一年）民立學校條例、（乙）（佛歷四六四年）强迫敎育條例、</p>
<p>將強迫班收歸部辦</p>
<p>（三）一切民立學校　不論是　校暹校或其他各國僑民所創辦之學校、俱應依上述之教育條例辦理、敎育部對各　校未有嚴格之限制、如准予華校照敎部所規定之課程敎授、目過去敎部尚准予各未强參暹文之華文敎員、在校學習時間內、擔任敎席、使　校得維持至今、如此之類、是見華校尚較暹校享受有特別權利、目敎部對於民立學校之管理、亦取寬容太度、如華校之有錯失、亦對以同種熊度、對於華校在在國創立、爲國兒童啓蒙、（按華所收兒童、皆係華僑子弟、）能一貫從善辦理至今、敎部對於各華人董事及各位敎員之善意、無限感激、故敎部對於在法律範　內、常予種種便利、惟至無可寬貸時、尚希各華人及華校、能體諒及敎部不應有只顧　一方的態度、</p>
<p>強迫華童學讀暹文</p>
<p>（四）當在各地頒佈實施强迫教育特、依照條例執行、除敎部予將强迫年齡提高爲八或九歲之各區外、則凡在强迫年齡內之男女兒童、則自七歲至十四歲者、但應在强迫校內上課、（按即暹邏所辦之學校）照强迫敎育條例而上學、爲暹邏實施强迫敎育之本則、故凡屬在已頒布强迫敎育條例之區域內、各國僑民之民立學校、倘欲招收在强迫年齡之兒童者、必應依照各種强迫敎胄條例之條文辦理、而照强迫教育課程敎授、至於各華校方面、因課程中間挿有外國語言科、（按即指中文英文）倘照强迫敎育條例嚴格執行時、各華校將不得收有强迫年內之兒童、（按即七歲至十四歲之華僑兒童、）惟敎部尚未忘及各華校在暹國與敎育之善意、故准予華校採用强迫教育課程相等之課程、而准予用外國語言敎授、此可調係敎部對於全國各華校之特別寬待者、</p>
<p>不準敎授黨義課本</p>
<p>（五）如上例（第四條所述之對華校之寶待、倘各）華　能　遵敎育部及敎育條例之施行、則各華校將得予種種利便、及得到教育部相當之援助、惟事實不然、大部份華校、竟利用此機會、實行教授其他各種課程及政治主義、（按即三民主義課本）並不作關於各種滴當之課程之敎授、如職業敎育或其他課程、查政治主義之課授、並非在寬待範圍之內、故此負有整理敎育及維護共同利益之敎育部、不得不停此種對各華校之待遇、（六）各華校旣有上述不合行動、勢將影響至不能使兒童達到强迫條例之目標、敎部爲謀共同之利益、及執行法律起見、只得收回教育權、（按華校所招收者、皆係華僑子弟、並無暹人子弟在內、該部收回敎育權、連中國之教育權、亦）併收去、實屬荒謬絕倫、）</p>
<p>英法諸僑不在此例</p>
<p>（七）至於各華校之違犯法例之實情、經杳問一部份辦理華校之董事、據調彼之創辦華校目的、為使兒童學習華文而已、倘有敎員敎授學生政治主義、彼亦不滿意、且甚失望云云、此項調查結果、可知一部份華校董事對於此種犯法之行爲、未有參加其問、敎部對於此種善意、甚爲感激、尚希其他各華校董事、能明瞭此事、而與敎部台作、使此事能照强迫敎育條例規定、獲得完滿之結果、以此足見敎部並未如一般不詳之謠言、所謂將實行封閉華校、及阻礙華人子弟讀華文之行爲、反之敎部將設法使各華人子女能讀中文、雖暹童亦有學華文之機會、如敎部爲便利一部份商人起見、在政府開辦之学校內、亦有華文一科敎授、一切在暹久居住及新來華人、對於同一法律及伺一條例之下、俱享有與暹人同等之待遇、（按英法美日各國僑民之旅居暹邏者、概不受暹政府此等待遇、）董校與暹校在同一法例所規定內、而華校當比其他各暹校享有各種如上述之特種便利、</p>

<p>— 淸癯</p>
<p>保甲的編制，是訓練民衆共同組織自衛的能力，實施以來，聽說：各地編靑事宜，尙稱順利：不過眼前到了第三期工作，有一件民間不很明白的事、就是連保切結之聯單上，要甲長戶長都應該撳着「指模，」因爲這一來，就苦了做保長的幾位先生們，大費其宣傳和勸導的唇舌；見乖識巧的，曉得辦理困難、趕先辭職，以省麻煩，什麼緣故呢？鄉民聽得要撳「指模」大家驚駭起來，說道：吾輩沒有犯過，也不曾做著賣妻　子的勾當，爲啥要撳「指模，」受這羞辱呢？從此可以看出還未到相當的程度，國家的法制政令，要實施到全民衆，和深入多數的心理一致，實在不容易啊</p>
<p>就四鄕講，確是這樣，倘從城市方面去看，那末：到底不同哩！像吾們嘉定地方，城裏幾個保長，恐怕有人懷疑觀望，他自己先撳着「指模，」來提倡，所以昨天看見幾本聯單上面，滿紙是「指模，「煞是好看，打私人木戮的，眞可以說是極少數：這一點城裏和鄕間，像煞有些分別吧！但所撳的「指模，」惜乎少點研究，用天然墨，因爲嘐質太重，不是嫌乾，便是嫌濕，有人撳得重了，成了一個墨糊塗，非但沒有紋路顯出，待到指提起時候，連紙也粘破了：撳得過輕，竟不會着紙，而且聯單上的格子很狹？一個戶長名字下，你隨便去撳，不是要打混麼？所以吾看了這一種手續，就想起着指紋學，也不可不研究的：倘若沒有經騐，驟然試行，不免終覺得有些美中不足。</p>

<p>— 天虛我生</p>
<p>楊敦甫先生，自予創設家庭工業社時，卽承贊助，而與小蝶尤相契重，前年於醉靈軒間樽夜話，益見古風，今歸道山，先爲筱巢宗城二兄代輓兩聯，此蓋三歎之餘哀耳。</p>
<p>言不盡意，惟靈鑒之。</p>
<p>承君兩世論交，逝水光陰十八載，但數載以來，常嫌會少離多，何况從今隔世。</p>
<p>勞我一樽哀挽，回溯道德五千言，而欲言不盡，總覺情長紙短，可能重與開樽。</p>
<p>代金宗城先生輓聯</p>
<p>與君共事廿餘年，責善則如父子，寡過則如聖賢，直諒多聞，受益固非淺也。豈知天命難違，百八遐齡剛半度。</p>
<p>長我流光十三歲，尊嚴有若師友，親愛有若弟兄，好惡必察，相知乃愈深矣。詎料星期作別，萬千珍重竟長辭。</p>
<p>代涂筱巢兄輓聯</p>
<p>總角論交，迄今四十八年，倚傍有如玉樹。不圖小極偶占，從此仙凡成永別</p>

<p>鵑按輓聯最不易撰，貴在情意眞切，明白如話，不能移用於別人。蝶老夙擅於此，惜多未嘗留稿，今此三聯同挽一人，出之一手，而各有所懷，低徊欲絕。詩有之云：他人有心，予忖度之，其斯之謂歟？近來聯語每多生硬空泛，錄此以示學者模範，或不以徒佔篇幅爲嫌。</p>

<p>— （波光）</p>
<p>長蛇似的平山岡，綿亘十數里，植遍了鮮紅的玫瑰。許多村姑，三三兩兩的蹭在玫瑰叢中，一朶朶的擷　含苞未放的玫瑰。</p>
<p>晴和的陽光，射到伊們的身上，都覺得熱刺剌的怪難受，早把棉衣剝去了，只剩一件單衫，還給汗水潤濕了腋下。</p>
<p>玫瑰花的顏色是多麼美麗，有深碧的嫩葉襯托着，益顯得嬌艶；更有陣陣的幽香，怎不令人生愛。</p>
<p>雖然是村姑，但很有幾個是象徵着玫瑰，有健美的身體，天眞的臉龐，怕羞的情態……在擷玫瑰的季節裏，街坊有些浮滑少年，特地跑到那裏，油嘴厚臉的和伊們搭訕。老練些的村姑伊是還駡的，這不像玫瑰生刺一般嗎？</p>
<p>玫瑰擷來以後，就整擔的去賣給專收玫瑰化的店家。可是他們原要經過女工的手，烘乾整理。再分售給點心店，糖菓店，做在食品裏面，吃來眞是齒頰留芬呢。</p>

<p>第十三回　作嫁固難賣身憐商品爲奴亦樂破產說農家</p>
<p>這縣的窮，又在申縣之上，而且他又是派到一個鄕鎭小學裏去。那薪水之小，小得會讓東方人笑掉牙齒，原來是兩塊大洋一惆月。周有容道：我雖然在陝西有這久了，可是我不想到小學敎員，竟是有這樣的苦。但是這裏面就有了問題了。試問這兩塊錢一個月，還是够喝水，够吃鍋塊？他就是十分的省險，反正不能餓了肚子來敎書。北海道：自然薪水少到只有兩塊錢一個月、不能再呌敎員自備火食。其實那鄉村裏的火食，每月也不過兩塊來錢。統共算起來，連薪水帶火食，大約是五塊錢不到。請問，這還算到了什麼待遇？我那親戚，敎了一個學期，覺得這和討飯也相去無幾。到後來他毅然决然的，還是辭職不幹了，志前道：他辭職不幹，有別人接手沒有呢？北海道：當然有。周有容笑道：令親不肯討飯，別人就肯討飯嗎？北海笑道：這裏自然也有點資格問題，我那親戚究竟在中學混過兩年，他覺得去掙兩塊錢一個月不合算。可是有那沒進過中學門的，他們在西北掙兩塊錢一個月，那就頗爲合算。志前道：你說到沒有進過中學門的，難道小學的畢業生，也可以出來當敎員嗎？北海笑道：這話要分別來說。固然沒有進中學門就顯着不大合，有些便是連小學的門也沒有踏進去，完全會幾句詩云子曰的，一般要出來敎書。（二〇一）</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>每個人都穿着全副的公服，美麗得猶如花一團，錦一簇；這種景象，本來是我久看而不厭的，但今天我却引不起什麼興趣了，反覺得他們的行動太遲緩，誤了我們前去看狗的大事，恨不能高聲催促。我再偷眼去瞧太后，只見伊也似乎很焦灼，說話比往常急了許多，所有的奏章，當殿一槪不看，只敎太監門收了起來再說。</p>
<p>然而這個早朝畢竟也不能太草草，仍須隔了相當的時間才完畢。完畢之後，我們便一起隨侍太后退回內宮去，先讓伊忽怱地更換了一套此較輕便的服飾，以便行走，然後大家依着往常的次序，排成一列散亂的隊伍，盼紛簇擁着大后，繞過了萬壽山的一角，逕望一御犬　行去。這座御犬　的地位是就在我上一章裏所講的各業藝工的工房的左面，和那製絲的工房離得最近，但相隔着也有一二百步路咧！一路在走的時候，太后又告訴了我許多關於現在我們要去探望的那些狗的情形。</p>
<p>「啊！你不要太小看了它們」！這是太后的一句口頭禪，彷彿是伊的東西，伴伴都是大得不可開交的。「它們也都有一節很長的歷史：最先它們也是跟我們一般是從關外來的，它們的原名，喚做哈叭狗，這是滿洲人的土名，現在很少人提到它了。（三一一）</p>

<p>— 龍騷</p>
<p>中國女子書畫會搜集了不少純女性的作品，這幾天在湖社公開展覽，倘從名義上思考一下，却是值得我們注意的。在文化大本營的古都—北平，在革命發源地的廣州，在高業活躍的武漢，在交通風景區的杭州，以及玫洽重心的京都：好像並不曾聽到有愛好書畫的女子，組織着研究此種藝術的團體。而現在，以上海爲中心的「中國女子書盡會」，糾集了各惆生活階級不同的婦女的藝術品，同時陳列在一處，眞不是容易的事情，何况這巳是第一次了呢！</p>
<p>爲了生產一個新與藝藝術團體，以獨立的精神繼續經營，完全由女性維持的不容易；對於伊們出品的評價，個人以爲暫時不必拿現代思潮來苛刻地說是太古典主義的，富藏着隱士生活的憧憬的，太缺乏了在社會的現實性的，以及忽略了「大衆的對象」的那些高貴的廢話。所以基於此種立塲，不想發揮現代藝術論，而只想簡單地來說一說伊們的出品與作風。</p>
<p>在那裏　：像朱人琰，張又芬，黃冰清，樊誦芬，徐冷翠等的山水画面，全赖才智与工力，故搆圖不落恒蹊。顧靑瑤仿石谿一幅，擬新羅六幅，不但精湛工深，而嫵媚的神韻，像輕靈的風似的，寫出了伊個人的詩襟。吳靑霞的人物，有黃山籌遺意。謝應新的「赤壁夜遊圖」，鮑亞輝的「春郊歸牧」，同具淸新雋逸的意味。何怡如仿大痴，陸小曼山水小幀，簡直出入宋元人筆意，有如一首美麗的宮詞，姿態盡寓幽閑中。趙含英，劉方瓊，何香凝，江亞南諸頓，皆淸逸遒健，墨筆設色都好。李秋君的六尺「花影吹笙」，和仕女屏幅，煊染得古麗明朗，布局也很停勻，伊畫的山水，也是怪惹人看了舒服的。包瓊校，毛燧華的仕女二幅，妍雅工緻，山水用靑綠點染，方法雅近秋農。陳小翠的「山貓野獵圖卷」，「荔枝香近」，「秋墳鬼唱圖」不用說有着秀逸出塵的丯韻，正如伊的詩格；而目也寫得一手好字。唐冠玉的花鳥，用筆淸絕。丁筠碧的草蟲，正因爲亂頭粗服，故而益見妍妙，龐左玉的「柳塘圖」，「晚秋圖」有着白陽的風情。李華書的白鷹圖，古雋極了，怕現代畫中，不能不算珍品了，黃荃徵的菊花，一共二十四幅，用筆生動，也是不易多得的墨妙。周練霞書墨蘭小幅，秀勁可愛，上有小翠秋君靑瑤的題句，倒是合作的雋品。徐慧的山水三尺屏，墨韻蒼潤，與金秋生，姚新華的淸超渾樸，相映成輝。</p>
<p>至於書法，馮文鳳的對聯最多，魄力很大。江道樊的篆或隸，也雄勁得可以。吳掌珠摹張黑女，很神似，只有一幅出品。楊雪玖的三尺屏幅，用墨酣飽，橫掃淋漓幾乎差不了莽漢子的腕力。此外還陳列了顧靑瑤的靑石篆刻，張軔之的刻竹，即使是附庸，在這附席上便能找出伊們對於藝術愛好的深刻，若使一定要找出缺點，則就在於全部出品，未免陷入泥古的意識裏，而忽略了現代藝術創作的精神。希望第三屆展覽時，能給我們以反映現實生活的寫眞，與向上意識進展的新鮮活潑的刺激！</p>

<h3 id="c252">文字與游戲 <a href="#c252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— 稜磨</p>
<p>最近有人閒談，說中國一般人大致都認得一二三四五六七八九萬中發東西南北等字。大槪無須敎得。這話誠然很爲幽默，可是所能引起的似不僅一點輕鬆的意味，而是含有相當沉重的問題，問題的沉重處，也還不是賭博之風的蔓延的可憂，而轉是文字敎育是不是可以利用游戲的方式推廣。</p>
<p>賭博與游戲，相去本只一間，馬將是賭博，象棋，軍棋，就是游戲了。軍棋因所用的文字已頗複難，大槪只流行於學校，象棋則在一般社會都很流行，也儘有不識字而能着象棋的，這也就使他得了認識將帥仕象相兵卒車馬砲等字的機會。舊式的紙牌，有一種是用上大人，孔乙已等句述接成付的，這到今日，雖已成純然的賭具，但最初這玩具的製作，或者倒是專供給兒童做綴字的練習的。廣東有一種大骰子，其六面所刻爲陳李黃區馬麥諸姓，我不知道是作何用塲，似也便於人記憶最習見的姓字。此外利用文字的玩具，就除開新製作的以外，原舊所有，諒還不少，如有人收集，一考察其是否有助於文字敎育的推行，想來不失爲一有心事業。</p>
<p>中國字似有根本不適宜於在玩具上應用的缺陷，新製作的文字游戲的玩具的缺少，大致也是爲此。從前在中學時，同學間很流行一種英文的項針續麻的游戲，由Have而Eer而Read，但中學生的英文是有限的，玩不暢快，因而改用漢字，英文是以單字爲本位的，所以漢字也用單字爲本位，其辦伕是由「娘」而「郎」而「防」，這游戲似乎良友畫報曾舉行過，其結果我不知道，但良友是徵求一個人自拚能拚多少的結果，而學校中游戲是幾人互接的。漢字比英文字却更容易接不上去，因此我們做這游戲時的規則，改爲誰寫出使人接不上的字反失敗。這一規則，使要用到的字數大減，但也使我們發現凡漢字左右或上下兩邊，都應用處很多的，也就都是效用頗大的字。現在想來，這游戲是可以仿英文拚字牌而製作中文拚字牌的。</p>
<p>如果我們能不避俗字，有許多簡單形體的字的効用，就非常之大。譬如口木土又四字，如儘量應用其上下左右的關係，就可共得三十二字，其中至少：吐嘆呆　呂扣杜權林杏麥埜堆栽吉圭雙桑聖綴二十個字，是我們可以承認其成字的。如此，我們若精選五十個効用最大的偏旁，大槪就可拚得一千以上的習見的字。這不僅在學習時見得便利，就排字中如採用這方法，也定可减少許多鉛字。爲求漢字的容易學習，是有把本已習見的形體的効用加大，而把罕見的形體逐漸取銷的必要的。筆劃的繁多，在識字上還不成爲最大的困難，一個龍字筆畫雖多，但旣在別的二十幾個常用字中也用到，則費力學習也値得。一個　字，除侃以外就更無他用，就雖不複雜，認識了也是徒耗費精力。</p>
<p>中國字中還有許多字本身効用根大，而幷不多作爲構成其他字的部份的，如二三六七年上西等是，也有在構成他字的部份上効用很大，而獨立時則無大用處的，如丙酉兌氏佳睘等是，這兩者實在該與以調和，使兩全其美。從前的應用及文字的游戲，從其中所能學到的文字，大都只有獨立應用的價値，因之效用也少，現在如知道注意其在一般文字的結構中的價値，則文字的游戲，還是値得提倡的。關於文字的趣味，一般人實在頗不缺乏，寫萬字的笑話，猜極字的字謎，射矮，重出係造字造錯的傳說，以及搓字，拆字的玩意，都是極通俗，或簡直是不大識字的人製造的游戲。這些都使我們知道，一般人最注意於字的分析，這趣味我們實在該加以利用。我相信，至少實在是兩字體拚成的字，我們是叮以用拚字游戲使增加練習的機會的，這雖是一簡單的意見，但若能引起人納文字敎育於游戲有價値的計劃，就有「引玉」之幸了。</p>
<h3 id="c253">閒愁 <a href="#c253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— 魏中天</p>
<p>一堆閒愁像塊石頭那麼地壓在我心頭已經不是短時間的事了。在以前，整天與生活的黑手肉博的時候，閒愁不允許在心中存在，那時節只知道要怎樣生，要怎樣來抵抗那黑色的手。而目前的環境已經變了一點，這生活的黑手也只是躱在遙遠的一角，用不着我來抵抗牠了。於是就有着多量的閒暇給我反有過去與思索未來，就在這種塲合中，閒愁花我心上生了根，並且一天一天地長育起來。</p>
<p>我並不是故意想作無病的呻吟者，實是戚到自己太不中用，眼前常常是一片黑。小時候自己心中堆滿着希望，有着自己憧憬的小天地，而年紀越大這希望就越小，認爲自己太渺小，少年時代那種祈求已不復存在自己心中了。</p>
<p>一個人的心境十分容易變，我近來非常怕黃昏，黃昏的顏色是死的，好像黃昏一降臨，世界已經死去了一半，而自己心頭那塊石頭也壓得特別重，人到了暮年就好像一天的日子到了黃昏，黃昏是老年人死的象徵—不管自己的年齡還離暮年那麼長遠，而一看到這象徵就會生出憎惡的心情來。</p>
<p>櫻花早已經看過，而櫻花給我的回憶還不壞，自己也確曾伴着友人坐在櫻花樹下笑過，跳過，忘記了世間所有的那些眼淚與哀愁，然而，這只是短短的一剎那。人們愛櫻花，也許是感到牠生命的短促而愛牠吧？世間有些事物，生命愈短促而愈使人感到可貴，這是人類共同的感想。</p>
<p>老年人看到櫻花，會追憶到他年靑時代的一切，那些夢，那些羅漫史，恐怕要太息的，卽使這太息並不十分吃力。年靑人看到櫻花會述想到他自己靑春的短促，而儘情的歌着，跳着，才不辜負這靑春。……</p>
<p>現在又是櫻花凋謝的季候了。當一陣大風吹過時，你可以看見千片萬片的殘花在空中飄，飄在地上，飄在你肩前，也會飄在你心上的。我把這些花片像對紅業那麼珍貴的把牠夾在自己的日記中，到日後，重新翻開這日記看見這花片時，不知是作何感想？</p>
<p>恐怕要太息的吧？</p>

<p>— 斐兒</p>
<p>「那可不曾再有過」。林君答：「一來因爲中國人有準備；二來殖民政府知道中國人的經濟權在這地方是有很大的勢力的。害怕社會的經濟受着影響，倒不敢再讓土人亂動了。而最緊要的原因，却是土人受着民族黨人的宣傳，認識他們的敵人是白種人，却不是黃色人種的。由於這種目光的轉移，讓時光發展下去，中國人的疑懼怕可以轉成和馬來人合作起來吧？」</p>
<p>「好，那末，我們便慶祝他們的勝利吧！」我不覺拍手笑起來。</p>
<p>林君也被我的笑聲引得笑起來了。</p>
<p>這時，夜已來了。一陣燦爛的電燈光照射在阿沙漢的街道上；日里的灰塵在陰凉的熱帶底夜晚沈澱下去。街道漸漸滾起了人潮，一陣鬱悶的空氣在空中鑒盪着。眼睛受着電燈光的映射，把被困在瓜魯河畔的草屋里的腦袋，微微地被弄得有點虛暈起來。</p>
<p>「到郊外去吹一下風吧！」我說。</p>
<p>於是我們便一同步行到駕在阿沙漢河上，達到對岸的蘇東鐵道的鐵橋上。</p>
<p>在長長的鐵橋之下，阿沙漢河的河水在黑夜里顯出一片的黑暗。只有一兩處受着燈光的映射，泛出一兩片的白色，和映出河水的皺紋。鐵橋上，有許多乘凉的僑胞們倚着橋憫，向黑暗的天空眺望，或咕咕唧喞地談着話。對岸序的火車站建築物遠遠地被罩在大塊的　影底下，而在燈光所映射的僑居人的臉上，我却能够看到許多個藏在微笑里的憔悴而憂鬰底心。</p>
<p>夜風時時從我們的白衣裳上拂過，使我的腦又淸醒起來。</p>
<p>有許多船舶停在江邊。在一堆堆的黑影上，許多微弱的燈光從船里照射出來。河的對岸，一大片赤道的樹林，把大地包裏得異常黑暗。（完）</p>
<h3 id="c256">雨途 <a href="#c256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— 徐盈</p>
<p>天落着微雨，我們分散了。</p>
<p>這次來趙家集放欵一共是八個人，四個保衛團丁，兩個銀行管賬員，仲禹和我。放完欵，雨便濛濛地下起來，依甲長的意思是要我們集上留一宿，早晨走，但是銀行管賬員要進城覆命，我們便命團丁護送着一點餘欵一同進城去。</p>
<p>揚揚手，分別了，仲禹和我騎着馬向歸途走。</p>
<p>晚風吹着雨絲打臉，衣服慢慢潮濕起來。半月來沒好天，路途尙在泥濘，我們是沿着小路走，這是一條長長的圍埂，兩邊是河水和稻田。天色一刻比一刻的黯淡，我們又沒有燈籠，不敢誕馬跑快。</p>
<p>沿路上少人家，沿途中沒有遇到行人。</p>
<p>「有傢伙嗎」仲禹在我背後問，「我怕……」</p>
<p>「怎麼」？我回頭問，「跟上啦……」</p>
<p>細聽聽後面的確有牲口脚步響。黑陪蒙罩着宇宙，除了當面的柳絲拂臉外，水波變作黑亮，有幾點船燈。稻田已失掉了綠色，遙遠處，恍恍惚惚的總似乎有東西在動。</p>
<p>我安慰仲禹道：</p>
<p>「老弟，你怎知不是行脚客人。」</p>
<p>「雨天裏」，伸禹聲音發顫「不是熟人不敢走圍子」</p>
<p>我一面講着話給仲禹壯膽，一方面我便在準備。我按着兩隻馬褲袋內的硬傢伙。「今天是張着放欵的幌子，難免不被人跟上。」我想。有點焦急。</p>
<p>遙遠的蹄聲的確是在跟我們，慢慢的便叮察覺出：我們走時他在走，我們停時他也停，雙方總在隔着一個相當距離，我心裏在盤算還有二里地下圍子，到了大路上便能跑。…</p>
<p>但是，又走進了一里許，我不禁呌起苦來。圍子斷了丈把樣子，鄉下人正在引水，我拚命的打馬要牠跳過去。馬長嘶着搖頭，死命的不肯跳，我便死命的踢牠後腿。我兜轉馬頭，先讓仲禹過去，仲禹的馬跳過去了。</p>
<p>我的馬還是不跳。</p>
<p>後面蹄聲更進，更近。而且從電棒裏射出一道强光來照着我們。形勢危急，已然短兵相接，我立刻把袋裏兩隻盒子掏出來端在手裏。</p>
<p>「仲禹」我喊一聲，「和」他們幹。」</p>
<p>我的預備放的姿勢在電光裏籠罩了有一分鐘的功夫，那電光便消滅了。我的馬，這時候却根自然地跳過那段溝。</p>
<p>過了那段溝，靜聽聽後面的蹄聲却不曾隨着，而且也沒有電棒向我們照射了。我仍然不敢放鬆那兩隻槍，隨時在警備。</p>
<p>轉上大路，雨却停了，我和仲禹並馬而行。</p>
<p>「他似乎知道傢伙差，不敢追了」仲禹道。「還聰明……」我在黑暗裏苦笑一下。</p>
<p>到了村子裏我才向仲禹說：</p>
<p>「幸運，幸運，我的兩隻槍裏沒有一顆子彈，假如……」</p>
<p>我們慶幸着沒有遇到「假如」。於是我們又可睡平安眠了。</p>
<h3 id="c257">雨（一） <a href="#c257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— 何爲</p>
<p>雨凄其地下着。天一發亮，天籬就推開了窗門。望見那斷綫似的春雨，灰沉的天色，不覺心頭打上了一個鬰結。</p>
<p>躺在帝邊榻上的舅父，遝是睡興很濃，粗暴地發出　聲。天籬看着那條扁圓的鼻子，那些隨着打　震動的鼻毛，那張露出半口黃牙的缺嘴，以及那個忠厚拘謹的臉孔，覺得爲了自己的私事，庶在這樣的雨天，氫舅父從睡夢中喊醒，很有點歉然。</p>
<p>『還是讓他再睡一刻吧。』</p>
<p>他帶着一點憐憫的感情想。可是在他想起自己已經根久不見娟子，此番北云，更不知何時能够後會的時候，他的心情又變了。他的全身都感到一種煩躁，火熱熱的，雖則天是這樣的塞冷。</p>
<p>的確，他是始終愛着娟子的。娟子也是毫無問題的沒有變心，還是那麼的熱烈純潔，他也知道。他們原是親戚，因為她是他姨母的女兒。可是她的父親是個在伍的高級軍官，她的祖父也在前淸喧嚇過一時，天籬的父親却只是一個株守田園的農夫，門第實在是根寒傖。這使他們不但不能結婚，就連很平常的見見面，也非得經過他們舅父的從中設法，因爲那個跟娟子形影不離，在她母親死後就養育着她的老祖母，是個最勢利的，差不多一看到天籬就要頭痛的人。這使他異常痛苦，他想要是這次能夠見到娟子，一定要問題明白，究竟她有沒有勇氣離開家庭。</p>
<p>他一邊想，一邊跑去把舅父搖醒。</p>
<p>「嗯，嗯，嗯……」</p>
<p>「怎麼老是嗯嗯嗯的，舅父，時候已不早了呀！」</p>
<p>原是躱在被窠里含糊地答應着的舅父，聽到這關是玩笑半是譴責的話，連忙一骨碌地坐了起來。</p>
<p>「天下雨不十分好……」</p>
<p>看到陰沉的天氣，舅父又吞吐地說，遲疑着。他擁着棉被坐在床頭，嘴巴一癟　癟地，彷彿十二分爲難。</p>
<p>「不要緊，舅父，你老是這樣多疑，難道路上娟子不可以戴傘子？難道她的祖母會說你的家里屋頂漏，因而不准她跟你同道到你家里住幾天？不，壯膽一點！」</p>
<p>天籬孤零零地等在一個凉亭里，舅父却一個人到娟子的家里去了。這兒離她家里只有咫尺之遙，望都望得淸淸楚楚的，他却不能去，這使他恨得切齒。</p>
<p>凉亭造在一條狹窄的山隴里，地位雖則不很高？却也可以看到很遠的地方。一條砌石的山嶺，就蜿蜒在脚下，一直隱沒在山麓的荒田中。在灰紫色的枯樹林外是滙合着附近許多小溪流的芝錦江。左右兩面全是山，重重疊疊的，只有對面是一片廣漢荒凉的平原　　一個缺口。</p>

<h3 id="c258">「沒有使命」與「印象甚佳」 <a href="#c258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>如果你預備將來要做一個要人，或者現在已登上要人之列，至少就應該學會兩句「術語」：—「沒有使命和「印象甚佳」。</p>
<p>譬如說，你已經奉了某人，省府，或者中央的重命，要到某地方去接洽，你一動身了，風聲傳佈出去，到處會有多事的新聞記者來拜訪你，請問你此行的任務。這時你平素卽使是一位老實人，也不得不說謊話，答他一句，「沒有使命」。沒有使命，那麼你此行幹什麼？你儘管含含糊糊對他說，「到那邊去玩玩」，「探訪幾個親友」，或者你可以索性說，「養病去」，要是你沒有什麼顧忌。倘然你的任務有些蛛絲馬跡，無論如何隱瞞不過，那你至多也只能這樣回答，「鄙人此行並沒有負任何正式的使命，不過以私人的資格去談談而已」。因爲要人所幹的都是要事，你若說眞話，「天機不可洩漏」，事情會給你弄糟，說不定還能影響到大局。所以「沒有使命」這一句「術語」，正是負有重大使命者，對付新聞記者的一件最好的法寶。</p>
<p>其次便說一說「印象甚佳」，這也是一句很圓滑的「術語」，到處都用得着。凡身爲要人者，有時總免不了要往各地方去巡視一番，或者被派遣到外國去考察什麼。巡視或考察的結果，報吿給人家知道。探問消息的，自然也是新聞記者。當你巡視考察回來，給幾位新聞記者包關着問你一句，「先生此次到某地（或者某國）巡視（或者考察），有什麼感想？這問題眞是廣闊無涯，說好答，也得好答，說難答，却也很難答。這時你或者覺得感想太多了，一時說不盡。或者覺得千頭萬緒，無從說起。或者因爲走馬看花，找不出什麼好說。或者雖然巡視考察了幾天，幾月，或者幾年，竟巡視考察不出任何東西來。然而這都不要緊，你儘管不必着急，以爲這一問。是很不容易應付。這裏我吿訴你，「印象甚佳」四字，可以做你的保鶹，把你從新聞記者的圍困裏，解救出來。「印象甚佳」，這不是一個最漂亮的答案嗎？至若你巡視考察的結果，印象是否甚佳，印象的佳，又佳在什麼地方，這儘管可以不管了，橫豎新聞記者得到了你的答案，就有新聞好寫，誰也不會再探原究底的。</p>
<h3 id="c259">香港一瞥 <a href="#c259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— 胡思衷</p>
<p>船過七洲洋了。一逮到中國的領海，遊子的歸心便劇烈地跳蕩着：</p>
<p>「黃色的祖國呵」，您的遊子又要來倒在您的懷裏了！」</p>
<p>看七洲洋的海水泛起了大片的深藍，便盼望香港的趕速達到。因爲香港g　到，灰色的故鄉也便鄰接着來了。</p>
<p>香港果後到了。最先是一堆秀色的小嶼，一個一個述接地在海中徘列着。綠草茸茸地，把山色佈成像少女的面顏般的嬌嫩。一惆個山丘旣矮又小，船從旁邊穿過，看起來直像兒童的玩具。海水又從深藍漸漸地淡化，最終且變爲淺綠。輪船在大洋中行走，像是全無涯際似的；一到　香港地界的羣山間，又像很是迂緩，專爲客人玩賞南中國的海中</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>山景，以舒四五日來渺茫的海程底苦悶似的。</p>
<p>香港以牠的洋化建築物顯現在旅人的眼前了。雖然地域還未超出大英帝國的殖民地，而一看到海中滿佈的廣東艇仔，和海濱熱哄哄的中國市民的鬧聲，便感覺到胸懷一寬，因爲此後我們是恢復中國小民的資格，已非像居殖民地的子民了。</p>
<p>船停在香港海中，同行的友人便都主張到山上玩玩去。長長的四日在茫茫的大海上漂流，陸地之於海上的旅客，是多麽覺得叮愛呀！</p>
<p>詢好輸船開行的時間，大家便跳到一只載客上山的小電船上去。走下　般的斜梯的時候，民屢次警吿着：</p>
<p>『香港扒手的手段是很高强的。你看，那些捲着大衣或雨衣在手臂上的烟鬼，最要留意呀！小心着你的荷包，他們以爲你是衣錦榮歸的番客呢！」</p>
<p>我微笑地踏入小電船裏，汽笛一聲，小電船開行了。海上佈滿大小的船隻，而艇仔婆搖着木槳，欵乃聲不住地在四邊播送。</p>
<p>看着前面香由一層一層的建築物，一層層地疊置着，很覺悅目。恨非黑夜，那香港山美麗而有名的夜景，不能照希望般的隨即照入了眼廉。而時問又短，香港也不能暢快遊玩了。</p>
<p>上了碼頭，桑聲很大。大家趕快乞一頓點心，從幾家大公司穿過，便雇一　車作山上之遊。香港市面的街道很狹窄，而行人又多，車行很不爽快待開出了郊外，在一層層的冷落的山道上爬行着，便很迅捷了。大海的各面像電影般一幕幕映入眼簾，而山上的大小的屋宇，樹木，橋樑，和有名的上下山電車，也各各逐漸地映入了眼球。市聲在由上很是低寂，使我們能儘量領略美景。但是受着時間的限制，我們不能對這東方重要的殖民地，作一個較完全的透視，那只好先做一個預約，待他日抹出空閒的幾天，再來巡視這個小島了。</p>
<p>忽忽地從眼角溜過了海上的帆影，和山上小巧玲瓏的別墅式建築物；中國市民用各式的姿態從車畔溜過，而殖民地的統治者羣也稀疏地被拋在腦後。我們又照若輪船規定開行的時間，踏出香港的地界了。</p>
<p>下午輪船向東開行，香港在腦後又漸漸地縮小以至看不見了，於是對這幾點錄的粗忽的瞥視頗覺印象太淺，而香港夜的未獲一睹，更以爲憾。此後，以爲易於再見的香港小嶼，竟到現在還未實現，眞是不勝憧憬和響往的了。</p>
<p>『什麽時候能够再見香港呢？』時時這麼自問着。</p>

<p>— 吳飛</p>
<p>淸明日那天，天氣是溫和而晴朗的，蔚藍色的碧空，除了幾縷乳白色的游絲在徐徐地飄着外，祇有一個滾圓的太陽正躱天幔上裂着嘴巴對大地笑；和暖的輕風帶來了醉人的花香，吹在錦榮嫂身上，她感覺到有些兒酥迷迷的。門前的一片桑樹上己放出了洋錢大的葉瓣來，錦榮、嫂於是又要將堆在擱上的許多蠶　蠶箉統統都搬了下來，掮到河頭去洗洗乾凈，然後再在箉底上糊了一層白紙，同時還小心地貼上一張紅紙剪成的蠶花太子或蠶花娘娘，預備爲收蠶蟻用的。錦榮嫂因爲只有獨個子，所以她祇飼了二張種，但就是二張種，要是蠶興起來，她一個人也是够累了。</p>
<p>在穀雨相近的幾天，她把窩在貼胸的蠶種每天總要拆開來看兩次的，看看有沒有轉齊？等到有濃黑的，毛茸茸的東西在種紙上蠕蠕地攢動時，她便將種紙熟練而有經騐的取了出來，放在一隻小箉裏，擱到灶上箉有些微溫的鑊子上去烊。同時她拿了幾片在去年採好的冬桑葉乾，在火上烘燥了，研成了末子，還去拗了幾個櫻桃頭相幾朵榴芽，來洒在種面上。後來在後門口剪了幾　野桃枝，大門後門房門上全挿滿了，烊蠶蟻的小箉裏也放了一根。</p>
<p>她最後又跑到桑地裏去摘了一握嫩葉，在切葉蒲墩上切得極細極細後，纔戰戰兢兢地棒了小箉擺在家堂前桌上，用一枝秤梗挑了種紙，以一根大鵝毛徐徐地將種上的蠶蟻全拭到了小箉里去，接着在蟻面上敷了一層切細的桑葉。</p>
<p>蠶箉置在臥床里邊，她每晚至少要起來敷三次葉的。桑葉一天一天的吃下去，而蠶身却也一天一天的大起來；從黑而變了灰色，再由灰色完全蛻化變了白皮，同時錦榮嫂的工作也隨着緊張起來了。</p>
<p>頭眠，由一小箉而成了三中箉：二眠，已由三中箉而變爲五大　了。到出火—三眠—她更是忙了；一方面是採桑葉剪桑葉，一方面又要捉眠頭，出桑屎：尤其是看見天將要下雨的當兒，她就得不顧一切的去搶葉，如果一日遇到天驟然間下雨的時候，卽使在沛霖大兩之下，也得去剪葉的。</p>
<p>爲了蠶，她往往連了吃飯都沒有了時問餐數，睡眠也沒有沒定，尤其是自從捉了大眠以後，差不多一晚沒有四小時好睡。然而看着那些花皮的白皮的活潑潑地蠶兒，委實是叮愛：聽牠們吃起葉來，那嘩啦嘩啦的聲音眞彷彿下大雨，一股觸鼻的淸香也只在蠶房要圻特有的。</p>
<p>頭出替，二出替，……其間雖也曾碰到過幾次大雨，但虧得她預早將宿葉備足了的，所以倒還沒有發生十分恐慌，不過在大眠新起娘的一夜大雷，她就整整的伴了一夜蠶檯沒有合眼。</p>
<p>一個月是很快的過去，蠶是老了，，錦榮嫂也瘦了。</p>
<p>現在客堂裏，廂房裏，全變了一簇一簇雪白可愛的繭山，她眞是快樂極了。雖然是一個多月心血精神換來的，但有了這許多雪白的繭子，總算也足以安慰她了。</p>

<p>「吃茶」在我國是很普遍的事，地不分南北，人不分雅俗，都好茶。北平人的「吃茶」是很有名的，高人雅士除外，販夫走卒，「吃茶」也多有成爲習慣的；我所要談的，就是這流人的吃茶，雅人的品茶，我沒嘗過味兒，不談。</p>

<p>茶館之不屬於燒餅舖的也有，因爲燒餅舖在早晨的工作是做燒餅，沒有功夫來賣茶；爲着有人要喝早茶，於是許多茶館就成爲專業，不做燒餅。</p>
<p>到過北平的人大槪都見過這樣的招牌：一條繩子繫着一塊紅木板，木板底下拴着有布條，木板上寫着「雨前」，「舌尖」，「香片」……等樣的字；那就是茶館。有的茶館還掛着許多紙球，紙球上垂着紙條，像把傘：　那就是燒餅舖（或切麵舖，那些紙條　是代表麵條的意思。）之兼爲茶館者。</p>
<p>這是北平茶館的外觀，和南京，蘇州，廣州等處的，略有不同。</p>
<p>這一流茶館的主顧，除一小部分是提烏範的閒人外，大多是賣力氣的人，他們可不是去「品茶」的，他們是爲了恢復疲勞，爲了讓身心都痛快一下：以很低的代價，拉來幾個知己，談一談，笑</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>一笑，有時也許駡一駡，是他們的娛樂。</p>
<p>有時這個現象是可以被看到的：兩個人力車夫，都倘着汗，拉着各人的主顧在跑，面對面的時候，這一個說：「喂，晚上二友軒見。」那個回聲：「一定的，我等你。」於是各人跑各人的道。那就是在拉着知己去吃茶的。茶館裏是不寂寞的，陌生人很快地便會成爲朋友；卽使是從未有過一面之綠的，面對面，茶壺對着茶壺，我替你斟一杯，你替斟一杯，這樣便會交談起來，談到生活，談到社會新聞；有時也駡，這惆捐那個捐都在被駡之列……他們的談話。似乎是沒有什麼隔膜的，天氣怎麼樣，貴姓府上，這些很少管到；彼此都誠樸，都豪邁，什麼都可以談；完了各人都走各人的路，像根熟識，而實際却連姓名都沒有通。北方人的性情從這裏是叮以看到的。</p>
<p>這種吃茶法是不費錢的，茶棄可以自己帶，一大枚的「高末」（卽葉末）便可喝半天，而水資，則每位三四大枚耳，這叮以說極普羅的。至於說書塲，和夏天的茶棚，則比較貴了，這一等的吃一次茶，恐非一角錢左右不辨；最貴的當然是公園的茶座，普通每位一角，約上二三個朋友，再嗑一二碟瓜子，已是一元左右，此應屬「品茶」範圍，茲不談。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Legislative Yuan Meeting Passed the Central Bank Law; Organizational Laws of the Ministries of Education and Industry Also Amended and Passed <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The Next Session Will Continue; Jiao Yitang Will Temporarily Serve as Chairman</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan held its 16th session on the morning of the 9th, after commemorating National Humiliation Day. Sixty-five members, including Jiao Yitang, attended. Sun Ke chaired, and Liang Hancao served as Secretary-General. Matters discussed: (1) Proposed amendments to Articles 17, 20, 21, and 22 of the Organizational Law of the Ministry of Education. Resolved: Passed with amendments based on the review by the Legislative Committee. The amended articles are as follows: Article 20: The Ministry of Education shall establish six to ten Superintendents to inspect and guide education matters nationwide. Article 21: The Ministry of Education shall establish fourteen to sixteen Section Chiefs and eighty to one hundred and six staff members to handle affairs of various sections under the command of superiors. Article 22: The Minister of Education shall be specially appointed, the Vice Minister, Councillors, Department Directors, one Secretary, and four Superintendents shall be appointed with recommendation, Secretaries, Superintendents, and Section Chiefs shall be appointed with recommendation, and staff members shall be appointed with commission. Article 17, which stipulates the number of special secretaries, is a common issue in the organizational laws of various ministries and commissions, and will not be amended for the time being. According to the amendment, two more Superintendents each of recommendation and simple appointment will be added compared to the current law, but the number of Section Chiefs will be reduced by two and the number of staff members will be reduced by four. The funding will not be increased. (2) Qingdao City's general budget for local ordinary revenue and expenditure for the 23rd year. Resolved: After the Finance Committee's review, it was decided that this budget should be submitted earlier. (3) Central Bank Law. Resolved: Passed with amendments based on the review by the Finance and Economic Committees. (4) Proposed amendments to the Organizational Law of the Ministry of Industry. Resolved: Passed based on the review by the Legislative Committee. The amended and added articles are as follows: Article 4: The Ministry of Industry shall establish the following Departments and Divisions: 1. Forestry and Land Reclamation Department, 2. General Affairs Division, 3. Agriculture Division, 4. Industry Division, 5. Commerce Division, 6. Fisheries and Animal Husbandry Division, 7. Mining Division, 8. Labor Division, 9. Cooperative Division. Article 8, Item 9: Regarding the promotion of the Farmers Bank. Article 13, Item 6: Regarding the promotion of labor insurance. New Article 14: The Cooperative Division shall be responsible for the following matters: 1. Supervision of cooperatives; 2. Planning and promotion of cooperative undertakings; 3. Guidance and inspection of cooperative undertakings; 4. Adjustment of cooperative funds; 5. Training of cooperative personnel; 6. Investigation and statistics of cooperative undertakings; 7. Other cooperative matters. The original Article 18 is changed to Article 19. The Ministry of Industry shall establish one Director of the Department and eight Directors of the Divisions to manage the affairs of the respective Departments and Divisions. The original Articles 14 to 17 are changed to Articles 15 to 18 in sequence. The original Articles 19 to 24 are changed to Articles 20 to 25 in sequence. According to the amendment, only one additional Division Director is added compared to the current law, and the cooperative matters in the current law are deleted and stipulated in a separate article. As for the two proposals for amending the Organizational Law of the Training Supervision Department and the staffing table and amending the Organizational Law of the Executive Yuan, both were submitted for deliberation. The former case needs further review due to the part concerning national military education, and the latter case is related to the national general budget for the 24th year, which is still being compiled. It was resolved to postpone both cases for the time being. (Central News Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) When the Legislative Yuan reviewed the Central Bank Law at the morning session on the 9th, the Ministry of Finance sent Deputy Minister Zou Lin and Coinage Division Director Xu Kan to attend the meeting and explain. The audience was asked to leave the venue. When the discussion reached the chapter on special privileges, the audience was allowed to continue to enter the venue after the representatives of the Ministry of Finance left. It was reported that the members had considerable disputes over the two chapters on capital organization. After the chapter on special privileges, in addition to adding Article 17, which stipulates that the maximum amount of convertible notes issued by the Central Bank shall be approved by the National Government, as proposed by the chairman, and deleting one type of two yuan from Article 18 on the types of convertible notes, as proposed by Lu Zhiyi, and changing it to five types, the members also debated whether the Central Bank's business of collecting deposits should include private deposits and whether the statutory reserve of each bank should be managed by the Central Bank. The members also debated whether the percentage of the reserve should be stipulated. In the end, the original proposal was passed. The full text consists of seven chapters and twenty-six articles. The main points are as follows: (1) General Provisions Chapter: 1. The Central Bank is a national bank. (2) It is established by the National Government. 2. The Central Bank is granted special privileges by the government, such as issuing convertible notes of the standard currency and auxiliary currency, managing the national treasury, and underwriting domestic and foreign debts. 2. The head office is located in the capital, and branches are established in various parts of the country. Agencies may be established in necessary locations abroad. 4. The Central Bank's business term is 30 years. (2) Capital Chapter: 1. The total amount is 100 million silver standard dollars, which is fully allocated by the national treasury. 2. When necessary, it may apply for expansion of capital and attract commercial shares. (3) Organization Chapter: 1. The Central Bank shall establish a board of directors, which shall be organized by 11 to 15 directors specially appointed by the National Government, with a term of three years. 2. The Central Bank shall establish one president, specially appointed, and two vice presidents, appointed with recommendation, with a term of three years. 3. The Central Bank shall establish a board of supervisors, which shall be organized by seven supervisors appointed by the National Government. 4. The affairs of the head office may be handled by establishing bureaus and divisions as appropriate. (4) Special Privileges Chapter: 1. The maximum amount of convertible notes issued by the Central Bank shall be approved by the National Government. 2. The Central Bank issues convertible notes of the standard currency in five denominations: one yuan, five yuan, ten yuan, fifty yuan, and one hundred yuan. 3. The Central Bank's convertible notes shall be universally used throughout the country and shall be exchanged for silver taels by the head office. 4. The Central Bank's convertible reserve shall have a 60% cash reserve, and the rest shall be a guarantee reserve, and shall be fully disclosed. The amount of convertible notes issued and the amount of reserve shall be published in a weekly list. (5) Business Chapter: 1. The Central Bank's business includes 13 items, the most important of which are collecting deposits, managing the statutory reserve of each bank, handling clearing of bills, and settlement of accounts between various banks, buying and selling raw gold and silver, and foreign currencies, handling domestic and foreign remittances, and issuing bank notes, etc. Each item must be subject to restrictions. 2. The Central Bank's acquisition of real estate shall be limited to what is necessary for business and for obtaining payment of debts. (6) Final Accounts and Reporting Chapter: 1. The Central Bank shall take the end of December each year as the final accounting period, and shall prepare various tables and documents and report them to the National Government. 2. Each final account shall, in addition to appropriating 5% as a public reserve, also be allowed to appropriate welfare funds for employees. (7) Supplementary Provisions Chapter: The law shall take effect from the date of promulgation. (Central News Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liang Hancao said after the Legislative Yuan session on the 9th that President Sun decided to go north on the evening of the 9th, and Chuan Bingchang, Wu Shangying, Zhang Huichang, and himself will accompany him. Sun also designated Sun Weidong, a legislator who is familiar with the situation in the north, to go with him. The next session of the Legislative Yuan, when both the President and Vice President are away from the capital, was originally planned to be suspended, but because of the congestion of cases, it has now been decided to continue the session, and Sun has designated Jiao Yichang to temporarily serve as the chairman of the next session. According to Article 3 of the Legislative Yuan's rules of procedure, if both the President and Vice President are unable to attend the session due to circumstances, the chairmen of the various committees of the Legislative Yuan shall mutually elect one person to temporarily serve as chairman. However, the Central Political Council resolved on the 8th to amend this article and stipulate that when the President is unable to attend the session due to circumstances, he may designate one of the chairmen of the various committees to temporarily serve as chairman. Sun's designation of Jiao Yitang as the chairman of the next session is probably based on this. (Central News Agency, 9th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke, Secretary-General Liang Hancao, Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Chuan Bingchang, Economic Committee Chairman Wu Shangying, Legislator Sun Weidong, Minister to Cuba Zhang Huichang, and others took the Pingpu train to Xu at 7 p.m. on the 9th, and then took the Longhai Railway train to Xi'an to investigate economic construction and customs. They are scheduled to return to the capital in two weeks. (Special Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Sun Ke, accompanied by Liang Hancao, Fu Bingchang, and Wu Shangying, took a train to Xu at 7 p.m. on the 9th, and then took the Longhai Railway to the Northwest for investigation. Zhang Huichang and legislator Sun Weidong, who is familiar with the situation in the Northwest, were also invited to travel together. More than a hundred people, including Jiao Yitang and Ma Chaojun, went to the station to see them off. Liang Hancao told reporters before leaving that Sun has always enjoyed traveling and has a rich collection of travelogues from China and abroad. When the Premier passed away, Sun intended to inherit the Premier's will to develop the Northwest, and planned a trip to the Northwest, but it has not been realized due to the complexity of political affairs. This time, he led his colleagues to the Northwest for investigation, to fulfill his wish of more than ten years. The scope and itinerary of the investigation will be decided after arriving in Xi'an. It is scheduled to return to the capital in two weeks. (Central News Agency, 9th)</p>

<h3 id="e29">The Franco-Soviet Pact and Far Eastern Relations <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>Since France and the Soviet Union concluded a mutual assistance pact, what impact will it have internationally? Although opinions vary, there is no consensus. However, in terms of the Far Eastern situation, France has fewer interests in the Far East. Even if it wants to take action, it cannot reach far enough. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, spans Europe and Asia and is a direct enemy of Japan. Among the world powers, other than China and Japan, the Soviet Union has the most vital interests in the Far East. Moreover, its military force in the Far East has always been a hidden concern for Japan. Since France and the Soviet Union have different degrees of interests in the Far East, their relationship with Japan is also different. If something happens in the Far East, it goes without saying that they will be sleeping in the same bed but dreaming different dreams. Therefore, French diplomats were overly concerned about this when negotiating the pact, fearing that it would provoke Japan's resentment. On the day the pact was concluded, both sides formally declared that this mutual assistance does not involve issues outside of Europe. The text of the pact even more clearly indicates who the target is. It seems that Japanese military personnel and diplomats can rest easy, and the Franco-Soviet pact has nothing to do with the Far Eastern situation.</p>
<p>We can say that based on the text of the pact and France's motives, the Franco-Soviet cooperation is aimed at Germany, not Japan. Although, the written regulations and the actual results are often different, and one motive can often generate multiple possible actions. We know that although Soviet Russia and Japan are currently at peace, the fundamental factors of their conflict still exist today. A Russo-Japanese war seems inevitable sooner or later. If war breaks out, what attitude will France take? It is clear that France does not want to offend Japan because its military force is not enough to independently guarantee the safety of Annam. However, would France be willing to offend its allies and attack its comrades-in-arms in Europe on the Far Eastern battlefield? The biggest prerequisite for French diplomacy is to ensure its security in continental Europe. In other words, it is to prevent the strengthening of German power. The weakening of Soviet power is the increase in German power, which is detrimental to France's security. Can France sit idly by and watch the Soviet Union's defeat and make its enemy happy? Recently, there has been much talk about a German-Japanese alliance to deal with the Franco-Soviet alliance. If Germany and Japan jointly attack and extinguish the Soviet Union, can France remain inactive?</p>
<p>This Franco-Soviet pact is similar in nature to the Franco-Russian alliance forty years ago. Their goal is the same: to counter Germany. Their scope is limited to Europe. If history repeats itself, then a Russo-Japanese war may break out again in the decade after the conclusion of the Franco-Russian alliance. In the previous Russo-Japanese War, France declared neutrality. The reason for this is not so much that France had no treaty obligation to assist Imperial Russia, but rather that the Anglo-Japanese alliance existed. Once France raised its troops to aid Russia, the British navy could immediately blockade the French coast. However, examining the results of French neutrality is quite thought-provoking. According to the recently published memoirs of the former French ambassador to Russia, Mr. Paleologue, France spared no effort to provide the Russian fleet with various conveniences during the Russo-Japanese War, violating the obligations of neutral countries under international law. Although the Japanese side protested, it had no effect. The French naval authorities provided the Imperial Russian Baltic Fleet with maps and routes for its voyage to the East. The fleet docked in French ports from the Cape of Good Hope to French Madagascar for six weeks. Sailors landed for drills. It then sailed east to Annam to meet with other Russian fleets. Food and fuel, etc., were supplied by the French side. All of this was not permitted under international law. In fact, Britain supported Japan in the front, while France aided Imperial Russia in the rear. The so-called strict neutrality existed in name only. Thirty years ago, the war still had this phenomenon. Today, the rights and obligations of neutrality are no longer strictly defined. In theory, France and the Soviet Union are both signatories to the Kellogg-Briand Pact and members of the League of Nations. Under these two major treaties, neutrality is not very applicable. In practice, the Anglo-Japanese alliance no longer exists. In the future Russo-Japanese war, France will indirectly assist Soviet Russia. This is an inevitable trend.</p>
<p>The one movement or stillness of European diplomacy is closely related to the Far Eastern situation. We cannot regard it as a matter in a corner of Europe because the Franco-Soviet pact explicitly stipulates that this pact does not involve issues outside of Europe. Will the Franco-Soviet pact promote the realization of the Russo-Japanese War? Or will it prolong the precarious armed peace in the Far East? We believe that since France is focusing its attention on Central Europe, it does not want its allies to use force in the Far East and divert their strength against Germany. At the same time, Japan, in view of the close relationship between the Soviet Union and France, and the fear that France will be forced to get involved if it fights with the Soviet Union, thus expanding the scope, will also take a more cautious attitude. The Soviet Union's diplomacy often uses a tough exterior to achieve the purpose of maintaining the status quo. Recently, it has also discussed with Tokyo the withdrawal of Soviet troops stationed on the northeastern border. Therefore, the Soviet Union's Far Eastern policy in the future will focus on cultivating its influence near Xinjiang and Mongolia, rather than trying to have its own way. This is what Japan wants, and it is also what France hopes for.</p>

<p>(Berlin) The Chinese Minister to Germany, Liu Chongjie, was honored at a banquet hosted by the Sino-German Association today. Many prominent figures attended. Mr. Reisman, the President of the Sino-German Association, gave a welcome speech, praising Liu's efforts in promoting communication between China and Germany in politics and trade, and said that what is most gratifying is the increasing number of Chinese students studying in Germany. In the future, when they return to China after completing their studies, they will constitute the strongest link between China and Germany. Reisman also said that during Liu's term in Germany, there were also a particularly large number of inspection groups sent by China to Germany, which is most welcome. After Reisman finished speaking, Liu stood up and thanked Germany for the various assistance given to him and the people who came to Germany. He continued that although China is currently facing difficult times, various construction projects are still advancing rapidly. At the same time, progress has been particularly rapid after the suppression of the Red bandits in Jiangxi and Hunan provinces. The greatest victory of the new Germany is built on a strong will, and the Chinese government's efforts and determination are also to complete the unification of the country and the reconstruction of the national character.

<p>(Vienna) It is rumored that the Hungarian government has stated that its participation in the Danube River Convention will be limited to stipulating non-interference in internal affairs and mutual non-aggression. It cannot participate in the Mutual Assistance Pact. The main reason for Hungary's suspicion of the Mutual Assistance Pact is due to Hungary's geographical location, which is strategically vulnerable to invasion. If Hungary does not join the Mutual Assistance Pact, then the other countries in the Danube River basin will conclude a mutual assistance pact. It is reported that Austrian Foreign Minister Weidiger advocates that Austria, Italy, and Yugoslavia conclude a close agreement, the nature of which is similar to the revival of the pre-war Central European Three-Power Alliance. According to the plan, Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Yevtic will soon go to Italy to meet with Italian Deputy Minister Suvich to hold talks on the Danube River Mutual Assistance Pact. The Austrian public is paying close attention to this move, believing that the closeness of Italy and Yugoslavia is extremely relevant to Austria. (Havas News Agency dispatch from the 9th)</p>

Schuschnigg will likely go to Florence to listen to the symphony of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, and take the opportunity to meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in Italy.

<p>(Paris) Foreign Minister Laval will go to Warsaw and Moscow tomorrow. Today, he held important talks with foreign envoys one after another.

Then he received the Polish ambassador, the Greek and Yugoslav ministers, and the papal nuncio. (National Telegraph from the 9th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding Foreign Minister Laval's trip to Eastern Europe, many say that Laval's visit to Poland is extremely important, while the visit to Moscow is only important in a formal sense. (Havas dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Investors' Association sent a letter to Foreign Minister Laval, who is about to depart for Russia, stating that the government has not adequately protected the interests of the holders of old Russian bonds. The association stated in the letter that Herriot showed sympathy for the holders of four million old Russian debts in France in 1925, but to this day, the government authorities almost disregard this issue. This is the main reason why the creditors of old Russia cannot sympathize with Soviet Russia, and it is too uneconomical to suffer actual losses due to empty friendship. Now, the Foreign Minister's visit to Russia is a good opportunity to correct this mistake. If the Soviet Russian side still cannot make fair arrangements, it is tantamount to publicly acknowledging the bankruptcy of its moral responsibility. (National Telegraph from the 9th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: The semi-official Iskra News Agency recently published an article, stating, "We hope that Mr. Laval's explanation of the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Treaty to the Polish government is no different from the one to the Soviet government. Any convention should not only adhere to the wording, but also consider the spirit. The relationship between Poland and France has always been consistent. Mr. Laval will definitely notice this after coming to Poland. We also hope that when French journalists accompany Mr. Laval to Poland, they will make a fair observation of the real situation in Poland. Although this situation is not favored by France, it is related to Poland's life and death." (Havas dispatch from the 8th)</p>

In addition, the chief secretary of the Ministry of Aviation, de Stan, and the director of the Civil Aviation Bureau, Guimier, went to Italy in two other aircraft. One of the aircraft was piloted by the famous aviator Mermoz. (Havas dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Air Minister's mission includes three items: (1) To seek close cooperation in French and Italian civil aviation undertakings and to negotiate an agreement on air routes between Paris, Rome, and South America. According to the plan, General Berlocchini, the Director of the Italian Civil Aviation Bureau, recently came to Paris and agreed with the French government on the basis of cooperation between the two countries on this air route. The air route from Paris to Rome may be officially opened on June 1. The route is jointly operated by France and Italy, with two round trips each week. The flight from Paris to Rome takes eight hours, with stops in Lyon and Marseilles, and flies over the French-Italian border Riviera area to avoid flying over the sea. However, the time at which the line flies over the restricted flight zone of fortresses in both countries should be agreed upon by the aviation authorities of the two countries. (2) The Sky Mutual Assistance Pact issue. According to the decision of the Stresa Conference, if Germany fails to participate in the Sky Mutual Assistance Pact recommended in the London Declaration, then the UK, France, Italy, Belgium, and other countries can conclude bilateral treaties to stipulate air force mutual assistance methods. This also requires detailed consultations between the French Air Minister and the Italian government. (3) France and Italy discussed issues related to the aviation technology cooperation between the two countries last year. These issues must continue to be discussed. In addition, Denain and French aviation personnel will also visit Italian aircraft manufacturing plants and factories. (Havas dispatch from the 8th)</p>

The Daily Telegraph reports that when discussing the Sky Pact in the future, the British representative will propose the amount of the country's air force strength for discussion. The minimum that the UK can accept is 1,600 front-line aircraft, which is equivalent to the strength of France. Recently, the British government has been actively expanding its air force, and the progress made is quite satisfactory. Long-range, high-speed bombers have already been built. The Ministry of Aviation has also selected areas for the construction of new airfields. The recruitment of civilians has also taken various measures to accelerate the realization of the air force plan. It is expected that within two years, the strength of the British air force will reach its maximum. (Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>

<p>(London) Today, the King and Queen traveled by car from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Hall to receive congratulatory addresses from members of both houses of Parliament. The ceremony was extremely grand. Representatives from all parts of the Empire, 464 nobles, 455 members of the House of Commons, former cabinet members, judges, and civil officials crowded the hall. Members were seated in batches. The nobles sat on red leather chairs, and the mace of the House of Lords was placed on a large red cushion. Members of the House of Commons sat on green chairs, and the mace of the House of Commons was placed on a table. Cabinet members sat in the front two rows. Officials from the Dominions and Indian princes were seated in the visitors' gallery. All members were dressed in formal attire, resplendent in gold and jade, adding to the solemnity. The weather was gloomy that day, but when the King and Queen arrived, the clouds suddenly cleared. The road through which the royal carriage passed had been crowded with people for hours. Although there was a cool breeze, the carriage moved very slowly. The King frequently removed his crown to respond to the cheers of the people and to allow them to see his countenance. After the King and Queen entered the hall and took their seats, the Lord Chancellor Sankey first read the congratulatory address from the House of Lords. After reading, he prayed for blessings for the King. Next, the Speaker of the House of Commons, FitzRoy, read the congratulatory address from the House of Commons. Both addresses were filled with praise. Finally, the King delivered a speech expressing his thanks. The address from the House of Lords took seven minutes to read, and the address from the House of Commons took five minutes to read. The King's speech lasted exactly ten minutes. First, he thanked the officials for gathering here today to offer congratulations, and he especially welcomed the representatives from India. He then said that in recent years, political upheavals had destroyed other empires and freedoms, but the complete harmony of the British parliamentary system and its constitutional monarch remained firmly in place, which was something to be proud of and thankful for. The ancient British constitution was always adapted to various changes. During his 25 years on the throne, he had encountered and overcome wars that previous generations could not have imagined, and he had faced new demands for democracy at home and abroad. He then spoke of the prosperous era of Queen Victoria, and then spoke of how external threats often united all parties, classes, governments, and ethnic groups in the Empire, and how men and women all did their duty, which he would never forget. He then expressed sympathy for the unemployed and finally thanked the Queen for her help. After the ceremony, the band played "God Save the King." After the music ended, the Lord Chancellor asked the crowd to shout "Long live the King" three times, which they did in unison. This was an unprecedented event. The ceremony lasted a total of 30 minutes. Then, the bells of Westminster Abbey rang out, and the King and Queen returned to the palace by carriage. Cheers erupted outside the hall. London will still be brightly lit tonight. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) Today is the third day of the British King's Silver Jubilee week, and the excitement of the people has not diminished. In the evening, thousands of people flocked to the West End again to see the lights, and the excitement was no less than on the night of the 6th. Although there was a cool breeze tonight, tens of thousands of people still gathered outside Buckingham Palace, cheering incessantly. The King and Queen appeared on the balcony at 9:30, waving frequently for several minutes. It is estimated that there were more than 50,000 people outside the palace, and the cheers continued for five minutes without interruption. When Prince Gloucester also appeared on the balcony, the crowd became even more excited. A thanksgiving service was held at County Hall tonight, attended by 8,000 people. Tomorrow is the 25th anniversary of the King's coronation, and both houses of Parliament will present congratulatory addresses to the King and Queen. All arrangements have been completed and the ceremony is scheduled to be held in Westminster Hall. The entire cabinet will also attend. According to Speaker of the House of Commons FitzRoy today, he will personally read the congratulatory address in his capacity as Speaker of the House of Commons. Prime Minister MacDonald today moved in the House of Commons that a congratulatory address should be presented to the King, which was unanimously passed by the entire House. At the same time, War Secretary Hailsham also made the same motion in the House of Lords, which was also unanimously passed, in order to express the sincerity of the two houses through praise.

The Minseito, on the other hand, sent members to participate, further clarifying its non-partisan stance compared to the past. Therefore, the result will inevitably have a psychological impact on the Minsei cooperation. At the same time, the government's relationship with the Seiyukai will likely worsen further in the future. (Nichiren dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After Prime Minister Okada visited Seiyukai President Suzuki this morning, he was quite dissatisfied with the Seiyukai's uncooperative behavior. In a statement at his official residence, he said that even if the Seiyukai does not participate, national unity will not necessarily be undermined as a result. Competent and capable people are not unique to the Seiyukai; there are many others. If the Seiyukai is determined not to participate, then they can only be appointed from elsewhere.

<p>(Tokyo) The government intends to have the Cabinet Deliberation Council study financial and industrial countermeasures, among which the most noteworthy is the control of the electricity industry. Japan's electricity industry is currently experiencing operating difficulties due to the excessive financial burden, which prevents it from fully utilizing its own electricity. The solution requires the activation of strong national power. Yoshida Shigeru, Director of the Cabinet Investigation Bureau, has also decided to control electricity, and its future is attracting much attention from the industry. (Nichiren dispatch, 9th)</p>

<p>Madrid. After the formation of the coalition cabinet organized by Prime Minister Lerroux, he attended the Chamber of Deputies today and delivered a policy statement of the new cabinet, which stated: "Spiritual peace, and the harmonious cooperation of Spanish people who are law-abiding, is the motto that the government adheres to. The various disputes of the past should be put behind us. The authority of the government should be strengthened, the foundation of the republic must be consolidated, and social and economic order must be restored to normal as soon as possible. All of these are the goals of the new government. The new cabinet is not a party cabinet, and its members all have strong and loyal political sentiments. The facts will demonstrate this. We are not socialists, but we believe that it is necessary to adopt measures to achieve social justice and eliminate class struggle. The government's primary concern will be to alleviate unemployment panic. When municipal elections are held in the autumn of this year, the government will submit a draft constitutional reform. However, constitutional reform must have representatives of all political parties participating in the government in order to gain a broad foundation in parliament. As for the temporary system of the Catalan Autonomous Region promulgated on January 2, this year, the government is determined to maintain it." After the government issued its policy statement, it was immediately put to a vote. The Chamber of Deputies passed a vote of confidence in the government by a large majority of 189 votes to 22. The monarchists and conservatives both voted in favor. The Catalan Regionalist League abstained from voting. However, the Republican opposition spoke out against the government, saying that the new cabinet was purely formed by the Centralist faction and the right-wing parties, and was a provocation to the Republicans. The new cabinet could not achieve social peace and might allow the restorationists to make a comeback. Therefore, the Republican opposition expressed that it could not trust the government, but did not want to cast a vote of opposition, so it abstained from voting. (Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>

<p>(Washington) If the Bonus Bill is vetoed by President Roosevelt, the Senate seems very likely to uphold the President's position. Veteran senators are rushing to devise a compromise plan to approach the White House's views, but they cannot agree with the compromise plan proposed by Democratic Senator Harrison, because this plan does not use cash payments. And the President may not approve of Mr. Harrison's proposal. As for the Bonus Bill passed by the Senate yesterday, the vote count was 55 to 33. Afterwards, Democratic leader Robinson indicated that this ratio was evidence that the Senate would uphold the White House's position. Currently, veterans are vigorously campaigning for the Bonus Bill. Observers say that if the Senate can obtain a two-thirds majority vote to defeat the President's veto, then the US monetary system will undergo major changes, because if the bill is implemented, the government will issue $2.2 billion in paper money. However, monetary experts say that the government has sufficient gold reserves, so even if new currency is issued, there can still be full preparation. (National News Agency dispatch, 8th)</p>

Russia is Pleased to Hear Japan's Peace Guarantee <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) Kerensky, the first Prime Minister of Russia, who is now in exile here, declared to a United Press interviewer today that Japan has assured European countries that no war will occur between Japan and Russia, because the pledge of peace between the two countries is very firm. Kerensky also said that France and Poland have both received this guarantee, and Russia is also eager to avoid war with Japan, because Russia's military strength is not assured in some respects. As for diplomatic relations between the US and Russia, they have become cooler because of the question of whether the current Soviet Russian government is stable or not. International observers believe that since Soviet Russia concluded a military defense alliance with France, it has no worries on the European side. Now that Kerensky has stated that Japan also has this guarantee, Soviet Russian officials should be pleased to hear it. Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov has repeatedly stated that Russia is determined to pursue peace, so Russia is willing to consult with other countries on any plan that guarantees peace. On May 1st, Labor Day, Russia demonstrated its military strength. Kerensky was not convinced by this. Observers believe that his statement that "not assured in some respects" is a doubt about whether the Russian army can be loyal to the Soviets. As for the Franco-Russian mutual assistance treaty signed last week, although it only concerns Europe and does not involve the Far East, recent Russo-Japanese diplomatic talks are enough to resolve some difficulties.

<p>The Security Forces Will Be Renamed as Special Police Force, and the Provincial Government Has Ordered That the Rotation Will Be on the 11th</p>
<p>Beiping Communication: The Chinese and Japanese representatives held talks in Tianjin on the 6th and 7th regarding the rotation of the security forces in the war zone. The results were satisfactory. Gao Jitan, the military attaché of the Japanese embassy, and Yin Rugeng, the commissioner of the Ji-Mi District, returned to Beiping last night (7th) and this morning (8th), respectively. After getting off the train, Yin went to the Political Readjustment Council to visit Chief Advisor Wang Kemin to report on the talks with the Japanese side in Tianjin. It is reported that during the Tianjin talks, after the Japanese representative Yoshii Seiya met with Yu Xuezhong, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, all issues were resolved smoothly. The rotation of the security forces has been decided to start on the 11th of this month. The provincial government issued orders separately today (the day). The new team under Zhang Qingyu was renamed the First General Detachment of the Hebei Provincial Special Police Force, and the team under Zhang Yantian was renamed the Second General Detachment. The two teams will start from Cai Village and Cangzhou on the 11th and concentrate in Tongzhou and Tangshan. Zhang Qingyu's team is moving on foot, and Zhang Yantian's team is going by special Beining train. After concentrating in Tongzhou and Tangshan, they will set off to their designated defense areas separately. It is expected to take three weeks to complete. The old teams under Fan Jinghua and Yang Yucheng will also concentrate in Tongzhou and Tangshan after the new teams take over the defense areas, and then leave the "war zone" and return to their original organization. Secondly, it was agreed that the three teams under Zhou Yuying, Liu Zuozhou, and Zhao Lei would remain in their original defense areas for the time being and would not be transferred. The numbers of the three teams have also been decided to be renamed the Third Team, Fourth Team, and Fifth Team of the Hebei Provincial Special Police Force. With unified names, command will be more convenient. As for the headquarters of the first and second general detachments, it has been decided that the first general detachment will be located in Jixian County, and the second general detachment will be located in Liushouying. The locations of the headquarters of the third, fourth, and fifth general detachments will be determined after the defense areas are newly demarcated. Yin Rugeng paid a visit to He Yingqin again this afternoon (8th) to ask for instructions and is scheduled to go to Tongzhou tomorrow (9th) to preside over the matter. Regarding the reduction of the Li Yunsheng team (formerly stationed in Yutian) currently stationed in Xiasi and Yanjiao, the procedures have been completed today (8th). It was originally scheduled to implement the reorganization on the 11th, but since the rotation period is also on the 11th, the authorities will advance the procedure for safety reasons. If it is not possible, it will be slightly delayed. Once the rotation of the security forces is completed, the cleaning work in the "war zone" will only have the task of taking over the Eastern Tombs left. (8th)</p>

<p>Nanchang dispatch: Chairman Chiang has been advocating for reform of the political system, especially in county administration. He has paid special attention to improving the status of county magistrates, strictly defining the selection of county magistrates, and increasing funding for county governments, among other improvements. Given the inconsistent levels of county magistrates in the bandit suppression provinces, it has been decided that during the summer of this year, county magistrates from Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Fujian provinces will be transferred to Lushan in batches for strict training for a period of two months. The subjects will include spiritual lectures, county administration research, etc. Chiang has also instructed Gan Naiguang, director of the Sixth Department of the General Headquarters, and Xiong Shihui to formulate specific measures and submit them for approval, so as to issue a circular to various provinces for compliance.</p>
<p>Further dispatch: Jiangxi Province was originally a military area for bandit suppression. After seven or eight years of devastation by bandits, the counties are in dire straits. Capable and strong county magistrates are needed to clear out bandits, reorganize, provide post-disaster relief, stabilize the area, and seek recovery to achieve revival. Therefore, Provincial Chairman Xiong Shihui previously established a County Administration Research Class and a County Administration Personnel Training Institute to cultivate lower-level political cadres. Three sessions have already been completed. Now, following Chairman Chiang's order, all eighty-three county magistrates in the province will be transferred to the provincial capital in batches for training. Section chiefs and secretaries of county governments are also included in the training. The first batch of county magistrates to be transferred to the provincial capital includes those from Linchuan, Yushan, and Duchang counties, and classes will begin on May 1st. The training period will be two months. After the first batch graduates, the second and third batches will be held, until all county magistrates have completed the training. It is heard that in the future, the county magistrates will also be transferred to Lushan in batches for special training by the General Headquarters to create strong political cadres. In addition, Jiangxi Province will follow Chiang's order to abolish bureaus and establish sections in each county, and set up district offices. This will be implemented starting from the 25th year and completed in three phases starting from July 1st (May 7th).</p>

<p>The Provincial Government recently issued a circular to the counties south of the Yangtze River, stating that the province has been handling drought relief through public works, dredging the riverbanks in Zhenjiang, Jurong, Wujin, Lishui, Jintan, Yixing, Danyang, Wuxi, Liyang, and other counties south of the Yangtze River. It has been nearly five months since preparations began last winter. Repeated orders have been issued to expedite the work. Many counties have been able to enthusiastically recruit laborers and quickly respond to the situation, which is gratifying. However, as of the end of April, there were still interruptions in the labor recruitment in various counties, which prevented the completion of the project. If the obstruction in a local area leads to the failure of the entire river's access, it would be a waste of effort. Now that the busy farming season is approaching, laborers will soon be needed for farm work. If people's hearts waver, the work will inevitably slack off. It is the responsibility of the county magistrates and team leaders to supervise and urge the completion of the project within the deadline to ensure its completion. It is hereby stipulated that, except for special circumstances, all projects must be completed by May 20th. All county magistrates must immediately comply and urge the laborers to work hard to ensure completion within the deadline. The dredging of the river for public works this time is of great importance. The government will use the results of this project as an important part of the county magistrates' performance evaluation, and will reward or punish them accordingly. The government will not make any excuses and will not allow any temporary negligence to delay the overall situation.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the "May 9th" National Humiliation Memorial Day, which is also the most painful page in our country's recent history. The Municipal Party Headquarters of this city, in accordance with the central government's regulations, held a memorial meeting yesterday morning for representatives from all sectors. The entire city lowered flags to half-mast and suspended entertainment for one day to express condolences. The Municipal Security Office, the Public Security Bureau, and the authorities of the two concessions implemented special alerts to prevent reactionary elements from causing trouble. The details are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Venue Arrangement</p>
<p>The venue was set up in the Municipal Party Headquarters auditorium. In front of the gate hung the Party and national flags and a white cloth banner, inscribed with the words "Shanghai Representatives from All Sectors Hold National Humiliation Memorial Meeting." In the center of the auditorium hung the Party and national flags and the Premier's portrait. Order slogans were posted on both sides. Slogans were pasted all over the four walls. The scene was very solemn.</p>
<p>Attending Representatives</p>
<p>In addition to Huang Shaoxiong, representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, attendees included Qiu Yunming of the Land Bureau, Jiang Huaixu of the Defense Committee, Li Guangteng of the Municipal Education Association, Lin Kecong of the Women's Association, Lu Youchang of the Jianghai Customs Supervisory Office, Wu Zishi of the Citizens' Association for Promoting National Goods, Huang Xianggu of the Second Special District Citizens' Association, Wang Jiean of the National Goods Maintenance Association, Huang Chu of the Labor Association, Ma Hanfeng of the Labor Education Association, Zhao Erchang of the Confucius Worship and National Salvation Association, Hu Tianseng of the New Movement Association, Wu Xiu of Jinan University, Hu Xiongdong of Jiaotong University, Jiang Shouchun of Tongji University, and representatives from New Asia, Junyi, He'an, Huiqiao, and other schools, as well as various institutions, organizations, and party headquarters at all levels, totaling more than 200 people.</p>
<p>Meeting Order</p>
<p>(1) All stand at attention. (2) Sing the Party Song. (3) Pay the highest respect to the Party and national flags and the Premier's portrait. (4) Respectfully read the Premier's will. (5) Observe three minutes of silence. (6) Report. (7) Speech. (8) Shout slogans. (9) The ceremony concludes and the meeting adjourns.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>After performing the ceremony, Chairman Huang Zaoxiong reported briefly: May 9th is the day when Japanese imperialists forced China to sign the Twenty-One Demands, a treaty of national subjugation. The occurrence of May 9th was by no means accidental. Since the Meiji Restoration, Japan began their so-called continental policy, following the predetermined steps, from seizing Huanqiu to signing the Twenty-One Demands, attempting to achieve the ambition of annexing China. At that time, Japan dared to boldly propose the Twenty-One Demands, firstly because the great powers were indulging in the European War, secondly because China's internal affairs were corrupt, and thirdly because Yuan Shikai hoped to realize his dream of becoming emperor. Therefore, Japan believed that this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and could not sit idly by. We must wash away this great humiliation that we have suffered. I feel that to wash away this national humiliation, we must organize all the people of the country. Regardless of farmers, workers, merchants, or students, they should all have strict organizations. With everyone united and of one mind, then suppressing the bandits can certainly achieve victory, production and construction can definitely succeed, and all undertakings can be brought into line and can be expected to succeed. And all foreign aggression can also be resisted, making the Chinese nation and country stronger day by day. That's all.</p>
<p>Memorial Slogans</p>
<p>After the chairman's report, slogans were immediately shouted: (1) Swear to wash away national humiliation! (2) Strive to eliminate bandits! (3) Strive for production and construction! (4) Vigorously promote the New Life Movement! (5) Abolish unequal treaties! (6) Long live the National Revolution! (7) Long live the liberation of the Chinese nation! (8) Long live the Chinese Nationalist Party! (9) Long live the Republic of China!</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government received an instruction from the Executive Yuan, which stated: "The National Government's instruction No. 295 on April 8, 24th year of the Republic states, 'According to the report No. 1 of the Military Affairs Committee Chairman on April 4, 24th year of the Republic, 'According to the report of the Chairman of the Aviation Committee, 'According to the report of Yang Guanyu, Deputy Director of the Second Department of this Committee, 'It is found that the national flag is a symbol representing the country and embodies the national spirit. There are established ways for its use, and prescribed etiquette for welcoming and sending it off. This is to show respect and uphold the system. Currently, it is found that while most officers and soldiers in various institutions can stand at attention when the national flag is raised or lowered, the direction of the salute has not yet become uniform. This Committee is also the same. This situation indicates a lack of love, respect, and veneration. In view of this, the Deputy Director proposes that the chair approve and instruct this Committee and its subordinate institutions, all officers and soldiers, that when the national flag is raised or lowered in the future, they must face the direction of the national flag and stand at attention to salute. Those indoors should also stand at attention in this way, unless there are special obstructions. It is requested that this be forwarded to the superiors for clear instructions to all military and political institutions to follow uniformly, to emphasize etiquette and express reverence.' Therefore, after reviewing the above, the items presented are feasible. In addition to instructing this Committee and its subordinate institutions to comply, it is appropriate to prepare a document and request your Committee to instruct all military institutions and troops and schools to comply. Also, forward it to the National Government for instructions to the whole country to comply uniformly, to emphasize etiquette and express reverence.'

<h3 id="e131">Grain Association Holds Meeting Yesterday, Resolves to Assist Overseas Chinese in Siam, Cables Central Government for Serious Negotiations, Unaware of Economic Severance <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The Grain Trade Association of this city, for the sake of assisting overseas Chinese in Siam, held a full executive and supervisory committee meeting yesterday afternoon, resolving to notify fellow traders to adopt economic severance and cable the Executive Yuan, Chairman Chiang, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, etc., for serious negotiations, and send a letter to the Siam overseas Chinese delegation expressing unanimous assistance. The Dagongshe reporter investigated and reported as follows:</p>
<p>Full Resolution: Economic Severance</p>
<p>Yesterday at 4:00 PM, the Grain, Oil, and Cake Trade Association held a full executive and supervisory committee meeting on the third floor of the Minguo Road Market. More than 20 people attended, including Gu Xinyi, Cai Yukun, Ye Tingfan, Wu Zisheng, Chen Ziyi, Zhu Zixiang, Feng Yongsheng, He Quansheng, He Xianggu, Yang Heqing, Yan Xiaoquan, Chen Yunqing, Chen Shaoming, Xia Xingcun, etc. The meeting was chaired by Gu Xinyi and recorded by Kong Rulin. First, the chairman reported on the petitioning delegation of overseas Chinese representatives in Siam and the letter from the Overseas Chinese Federation reporting the Siamese government's implementation of harsh policies and oppression. Then, each committee member stood up to express their opinions, and discussions began. The Siamese government's promulgation of harsh regulations to suppress overseas Chinese cannot be ignored by this association. In addition to cabling the central authorities, requesting them to make serious representations to the Siamese government, should effective sanctions be taken? (Resolution) If the Siamese government does not realize and improve the regulations, this association will notify fellow traders to sever economic ties with Siam.</p>
<p>Cable Central Government for Serious Negotiations</p>
<p>"To Premier Wang of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Chairman Chiang of Guizhou, and Wang Junjian, Acting Minister of the Nanjing Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Having read the reports that the Siamese government has promulgated compulsory education and immigration laws, as well as various regulations for managing industry and commerce, on the one hand, implementing assimilation policies, and on the other hand, oppressing and restricting our country's immigrants and suppressing overseas Chinese industry and commerce, its insidiousness and cruelty have reached the extreme. If these regulations are implemented, our three million overseas Chinese will forever be reduced to Siamese slaves. This is of great concern to the future of the nation. We implore your (Chairman) (Seat) to quickly (instruct) (consult) the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Your Ministry) to make serious representations to the Siamese government, to ensure the cancellation of the newly promulgated harsh regulations, protect our compatriots, and preserve our national dignity. The association will not forget its inadequacy and will resolutely adopt effective sanctions as a backing for the government. This urgent cable expresses our extreme apprehension. Gu Xinyi, Chairman of the Shanghai Grain, Oil, and Cake Trade Association, kowtows, Geng."</p>
<p>Reply to Overseas Chinese Federation: Vow to be a Backing</p>
<p>"In reply, having received your letter, we have heard everything. The Siamese government's promulgation of various regulations, adhering to its psychology of bullying the weak, implements policies of suppressing overseas Chinese. If these are put into practice, three million overseas Chinese will be forever lost. Our country has historically been benevolent to the Siamese people, as history can attest. Now the Siamese government repays kindness with resentment. Its intentions are perverse, and its measures are misguided, which is extremely infuriating. All compatriots cannot ignore it. In addition to sending a cable to the Executive Yuan, Chairman Chiang, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting them to quickly make serious representations to the Siamese government and ensure the improvement of the newly promulgated regulations, this association will resolutely adopt effective sanctions as a backing for the government. We are writing in reply and hope you will take note. This is addressed to the Siamese Overseas Chinese Petition Delegation, the Overseas Chinese Federation Organizing Committee."</p>
<h3 id="e132">The City Was Hot Yesterday, Highest Temperature 94.5 Degrees <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Since the beginning of spring, the climate of Shanghai has been unstable, with abnormal wind and rain. Although it was late spring last month, the cold wind was still biting. At the beginning of this month, the weather suddenly cleared up, and the temperature gradually increased. Yesterday, the sun was scorching, and it was extremely muggy. According to the astronomical observatory, the highest temperature was 94.5 degrees, and the lowest was 62.1 degrees. The hot summer weather is approaching. It cooled down in the evening, and the air pressure was quite high. There are unlikely to be any changes in the short term, it said.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Municipal Party Headquarters Promotes Literacy Education: Notifies All Party Members to Launch a Unified Campaign <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>In order to actively promote literacy education, the Municipal Party Headquarters, in addition to formulating measures for party headquarters at all levels to promote literacy education and instructing all district party headquarters to prepare for establishment by June 20, also formulated measures for party members to teach the masses literacy and notified all party members to launch a unified campaign. Here is an excerpt from its letter to comrades: "Illiteracy is prevalent throughout our country. The number is staggering. Even in Shanghai, which is known as the economic hub and cultural center of the country, the number of illiterate people is probably higher than in the remote areas of Europe and the United States. The weakness of the nation and the decline of the people's spirit are not without reason. Because there are many illiterate people, culture will inevitably decline. Even if there are good methods to save the country and enthusiastic patriotic movements, it is still difficult to seek the understanding and support of the masses. If we look at the difficulty in implementing democracy and improving people's livelihood today, the reason is also known. Why are science and technology in Europe and the United States so prosperous, and why is construction so unhindered? Why are political facilities and social institutions so flexible in operation? This is because the level of public knowledge has been generally improved. Today, inventions and creations in various countries are heard from time to time, but even if our country catches up, it still cannot reach one ten-thousandth of their level. As a result, various theories are practiced in various countries and are all logical, but when applied to our country, they are not applicable everywhere. These are all obvious facts that can be known without further investigation. In view of this, our party has designated the literacy movement as one of the seven movements. At this time, the government is determined to eliminate illiteracy in the city, which is the time for us to work hard. Teaching one more person to read is to increase the strength of the country by one point, serve society, and benefit people. This is the right time. All comrades in the city must remember the importance of their mission and the need for civilian literacy, abide by the party's orders, work hard to promote it, and achieve complete success as soon as possible. We have high hopes for this."</p>

<h3 id="e138">League of Nations Water Conservancy Expert Nie Yufu Returned to Geneva Yesterday: Yellow River Development Can Hardly Be Delayed, Raising Huge Sums May Not Be Necessary <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reported that Nie Yufu, a water conservancy expert dispatched by the League of Nations to China for inspection, returned to Geneva yesterday morning on the Java Shipping Company's Zhishadani to report his mission. Guo Dehua, Secretary of the National Economic Council, represented the Council, and Heronmen, the Dutch Consul General in Shanghai, and others went to see him off. Mr. Nie's inspection in China this time has been very successful. According to the Central News Agency reporter's investigation with relevant parties, Mr. Nie has made a detailed investigation of the Yellow River water conservancy, believing that the dikes on both sides of the Yellow River are increasing day by day and the danger is increasing. They must be improved. He believes that the previous water conservancy experts' inspections of the Yellow River water conservancy, which required tens of millions of yuan to purchase machinery, contained the role of peddling machinery and were not for the sake of China itself. The development of Yellow River water conservancy and the prevention of floods do not necessarily rely entirely on machinery. Plows can also be used. Chinese farmers are extremely diligent and thrifty. Manpower can be used to dig a number of rivers between the two banks, which can prevent floods and irrigate the barren land and fields on both banks. This is one of the ways to develop the Yellow River water conservancy. If tens of millions of yuan are used to control the river, it may not be possible to raise the funds in a time of extreme social and economic panic, and the development of the Yellow River water conservancy cannot be delayed due to the difficulty of raising huge sums of money, he said.</p>

<p>Departing Today</p>
<p>The Chinese representatives attending the International Labor Conference to be held in Geneva next month include employer representative Wang Zhisheng, advisor Gu Bingyuan, secretary Zhang Hualian, labor representative Wang Jinxia, advisor Wu Wentian, and secretary Zhang Daomin.

At that time, the National Federation of Commercial Associations, the China General Federation of Industry, the National Labor Alumni Association, and the representatives' relatives and friends will go to welcome them.</p>
<p>Farewell Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>Yesterday at 1:00 PM, the National Labor Alumni Association held a farewell banquet at the Yiyou Society on Hankou Road for the labor and management representatives attending this year's National Labor Conference, and invited leaders from all walks of life to accompany them. Guo Shun, Jiang Huaixu, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Qian Chengxu, Wu Zhihao, Zhu Xuefan, Wu Yunzhu, Wu Kaisheng, Xia Qifeng, Zhu Maocheng, Cheng Haifeng, Zhang Xianglin, Li Yongxiang, and the attending National Labor representatives were present, totaling dozens of people. Chairman Wu Qingtai delivered a speech, stating that the purpose of gathering leaders from the industrial and commercial sectors is to bid farewell to the attending representatives, and he hoped that labor and management would cooperate with each other to achieve satisfactory results and bring honor to the country and benefits to labor and management.</p>
<p>Reporting Proposals</p>
<p>Afterwards, employer representative Wang Zhisheng delivered a thank-you speech. Labor representative Wang Jinxia reported that at this conference, we will raise the long-pending issue of factory inspections in the concessions, urge all countries to pay attention to it, and promote its early realization. Secondly, we will restrict the large-scale dumping of foreign goods to save our country's extremely depressed economy. As for the issue of youth unemployment, it will not be raised due to its complexity. The colleagues will take this opportunity to investigate the unemployment problems in various countries and their relief methods for reference. The labor and management advisors Lin Kanghou, Wang Xiaolai, Wu Kaisheng, Zhu Xuefan, Zhu Xiangcheng, Cheng Haifeng, and others also delivered speeches of encouragement. Until about 3:00 PM, the representatives, together with Zhu Xuefan, chairman of the General Labor Union, and Li Yongxiang, the previous representative, solemnly discussed the proposals.</p>

<p>Anticipating Minister of Finance Kong's arrival in Shanghai, the implementation date will be determined.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the five million yuan relief loan for industry and commerce, after Minister Kong convened a meeting with leaders of the banking and financial industries to discuss the allocation of funds, the Bankers' Association has agreed to actively encourage subscriptions to raise 1.5 million yuan. Yesterday, a responsible person stated that one million yuan should be no problem, and that they will encourage subscriptions from banks with more ample funds for the remaining 500,000 yuan, with the possibility of reaching the full amount. On the financial industry side, although the managers of various member money houses resolved in a meeting the day before to maintain the original proposal of 250,000 yuan, the funds that each money house should subscribe have been submitted to the reserve of the Money Trade Association, and they can be handed over as soon as it is formally implemented. As for how to raise the remaining 750,000 yuan, it will be necessary to await the association's chairman, Qin Runqing, to report to Minister Kong and discuss it. The two and a half million yuan undertaken by the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Bank of China have all been reserved. Various industrial and commercial sectors have expressed hope for early implementation to provide relief, as the amount already secured is 4.25 million yuan, which they suggest should be lent out first, and then find ways to raise the remaining amount. The banking community also shares this sentiment. However, whether to start immediately or wait until the full five million yuan is raised will depend on Minister Kong's arrival in Shanghai this morning and consultations with all parties.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Zhejiang Provincial Government to Borrow Spring Cocoon Loans from Shanghai Banks <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>1.8 Million Yuan at 8% Interest; Formal Signature After Drafting the Contract</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Zhejiang Provincial Government's Finance and Construction Departments negotiated with the banking community for a spring cocoon loan of 1.8 million yuan, which was decided at a meeting in Shanghai a few days ago, and a contract was drafted. After obtaining details, they are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Drafting the Contract</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province is following the example of last year's autumn cocoon loan, borrowing 2 million yuan for spring cocoons from 14 banks including the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications in Shanghai. After first contacting the Hangzhou branches of each bank, Zeng Yangfu, Director of the Zhejiang Construction Department, came to Shanghai as a representative to convene the persons in charge of each bank. As a result of the meeting, it was decided to borrow 1.8 million yuan this spring because the 3 million yuan borrowed last autumn had not been exhausted. After each bank confirmed the amount they would borrow, a contract was drafted and taken to Hangzhou. The contract will be signed in the next few days after being approved by the Zhejiang Provincial Government. The interest rate is 8%, and there is no specified repayment period.</p>
<p>Loan Allocation</p>
<p>The allocation of the 1.8 million yuan loan among the banks is as follows: Bank of China, 450,000 yuan; Bank of Communications, 300,000 yuan; Zhejiang Industrial Bank, 240,000 yuan; Bank of Shanghai, 150,000 yuan; Ningbo Commercial Bank, 90,000 yuan; China Industrial Bank, 90,000 yuan; the Mainland Bank, Salt Industry Bank, Zhongnan Bank, Jincheng Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, China National Goods Bank, China General Chamber of Commerce Bank, and China Reclamation Bank, each 60,000 yuan. The joint banking group will appoint the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Zhejiang Industrial Bank as representatives, as these three banks all have branches in Hangzhou, making it easier to collect and disburse funds and handle all related matters.</p>
<p>Repayment Method</p>
<p>The results of last autumn's loan were very good, but the 3 million yuan borrowed was not fully used. The provincial government needed funds to be disbursed by the banking group representatives at any time, and after the provincial government sold the cocoons and raw silk produced, the proceeds were returned to the banking group at any time. The amount currently borrowed has been gradually returned, and as of February, 190,000 yuan remained. It is expected to be fully repaid within a few months. The repayment method for this spring's orchid loan will also follow this method.</p>

<p>Dinghai correspondence: The Zhejiang Provincial Fisheries Experiment Station, recognizing the importance of fish fry, intends to send personnel to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River to investigate the spawning sites and spawning environment of grass carp, carp, and silver carp. However, due to the substantial costs involved, and because the fish fry of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, and other provinces are all supplied by the Yangtze River, it is not a problem for Zhejiang Province alone. Therefore, the Ministry of Industry was asked to subsidize the investigation expenses, and permission was granted to allocate a subsidy of 500 yuan. It is reported that the station has sent two technicians, Chen Chunshou and Lin Shuyan, with equipment to carry out the investigation. The estimated itinerary is two months, passing through the six provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan. Of all previous investigations of fish fry in China, this one is the largest in scale.</p>

<h3 id="e148">Proposed Establishment of a Commercial Union Bank; National Federation of Chambers of Commerce Offers Opinions <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Units of Stores Still Have Untoward Matters; The Amount Per Share is Proposed to Be Increased to One Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>The Guangzhou Municipal Chamber of Commerce and others recently proposed to organize a National Commercial Union Bank and sent a letter to solicit the opinions of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce. A reporter from the Shin Shi News Agency specifically visited Lin Kanghou, chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, yesterday. According to Lin, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce recently received a letter from the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce proposing to organize a National Commercial Union Bank and providing a plan. The method is to unite chambers of commerce in various provinces and cities across the country to solicit shares from local stores, with each share priced at five yuan. Xiong Shaokang of the Guangdong Provincial Chamber of Commerce also made contact in person when he recently came to Shanghai. After research, a reply was given and several suggestions were made for their reference. It is believed that soliciting shares from local stores at five yuan per share is a good approach, but in practice, there are still difficulties. Therefore, it is considered that five yuan per share is too fragmented, and it should be at least one hundred yuan to suit general banking habits. At the same time, taking stores as the unit for shareholders, due to future inheritance rights and other relationships, is not appropriate, and it seems more appropriate to take people as the unit. The above-mentioned opinions have been sent to Guangdong for reference. Generally speaking, the National Commercial Union Bank may or may not be realized in the short term, but Guangdong may be expected to establish a Commercial Union Bank first and then seek expansion in the future.</p>

<p>According to Lin, the director of the Shanghai Audit Office, speaking to a reporter from the Dagong News Agency yesterday, there are many agencies under the Shanghai Municipal Government. After Mayor Wu ordered his subordinates to actively reform old malpractices, administration has gradually become standardized. In order to understand the financial situation of this city and review the receipts and expenditures of Shanghai, and to put national finance on the right track, the Audit Office was established on the first day of last month and stipulated that the 15th of each month is the audit day.

<h3 id="e151">Tax Affairs Administration Replies to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce; Imploring for the Cautious Indictment of Stamp Tax Cases <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>For Suspicious Cases, First Request Guidance From Superiors; The Municipal Chamber of Commerce is Requested to Re-Determine Procedures for Protesting</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, due to the repeated occurrence of delivery receipts in this city that should not be stamped according to regulations but were inspected and fined, specially requested the Tax Affairs Administration to properly formulate preventive measures. A reply has been received from the Tax Affairs Administration adopting this, however, after the delivery receipt of the Heji Printing Company was fined and the protest was ineffective, the Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance, allowing it to protest again and return the fine. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>Tax Affairs Administration Reply Letter: Received your association's official letter Shangzi No. 412 and Shangzi No. 433, stating that the delivery receipts of Ruida, Datong, Heyuji, Maotai, and other coal shops were heavily fined, requesting that this type of delivery receipt should not be stamped according to regulations, ordering the inspectors in the concession to comply, and planning thorough preventive measures to avoid similar cases from happening again in the future, etc. With regard to the fact that the delivery receipt is the receipt for goods, there is no provision for stamping in the current Provisional Regulations on Stamp Tax, so it is not necessary to stamp. The current practice is to have the shop prepare a delivery receipt for the recipient to stamp. This delivery receipt is a receipt for goods, and according to the current Provisional Regulations on Stamp Tax, there is no requirement to affix stamps, so it is naturally not necessary to affix stamps. Regarding the matter of the Ruida and other coal shops' delivery receipts being fined, since it has been stated that an appeal has been filed, there will naturally be remedial measures. However, the fact that the inspectors arbitrarily prosecute, causing the shopkeepers to often suffer the loss of appeal expenses, is also true. When inspectors perform their duties, if they can follow the laws and regulations and carefully prosecute, or if they send suspicious cases to their superiors for review before imposing a fine, it will be sufficient to reduce future disputes. The Jiangsu Stamp Tax Bureau and the Shanghai Concession Inspection Office have been ordered to instruct their inspectors to comply. The above is the reply to your letter for your information.</p>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Telegram</p>
<p>Ministerial Office of the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing: According to the regulations and your ministry's interpretation, goods receipts within the special zone of this city do not require stamping, but they have been wrongly inspected and fined. According to the latest reports to this association, there have been four such cases. In two of these cases, fines of over one thousand yuan were imposed, and in the other two cases, fines of several hundred yuan were imposed. Small shops are afraid of losing their homes and going bankrupt. In three of these cases, the association has corresponded with the Tax Affairs Administration under your ministry to plan relief, but because the cases belong to the court, there are no appropriate measures. In the case of the Heji Printing Company, the result of the protest was still the original ruling. The only avenue of relief for merchants is almost zero. As the days get longer, what will happen? For the sake of urgent treatment, it is proposed that your ministry amend the regulations to allow for further appeals in such cases, and at the same time, send the past orders of your ministry regarding such cases to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for referral to courts at all levels for investigation and reference, in order to reduce the lack of communication. Before the measures for further appeals are stipulated, all fines of the Heji Printing Company and others that have been judged by the court but should not be borne in reality should be investigated and refunded in full to show fairness.</p>

<p>More Than Five Years After Being Killed by a Car; Cao's Father is Seventy Years Old and Destitute</p>
<p>Regarding the case of Cao Yongkuan being injured and killed by an American Shanghai-based Naval Transport vehicle on November 29, 1929, the authorities negotiated compensation with the American Consulate according to law, but no compensation has been paid to date. The Chinese Taxpayer Association of the Public Concession specifically sent letters to the American Consulate, the Public Works Department, and the Municipal Government yesterday to request negotiations. The original text is recorded below: (1) Report to the Municipal Government: Regarding the case of Cao Yongkuan being injured and killed by an American Shanghai-based Naval Transport vehicle on November 29, 1929, his father has repeatedly petitioned your government, requesting a transfer to the American authorities for negotiations to compensate for injury and compensation. Now, according to Cao Zichang's statement to the association, he is 75 years old, his life is difficult, and he is destitute. Since his son Yongkuan was injured and killed in an accident, he has been demanding compensation for more than five years, but nothing has been received. We earnestly request that your government transfer the matter to the American Consul General in Shanghai for prompt negotiation and payment of compensation. This is both a public service and a matter of public morality. We hereby inform the Shanghai Municipal Government. (2) Letter to the Public Works Department: Regarding the case of Cao Yongkuan being injured and killed by an American Shanghai-based Naval Transport vehicle on November 29, 1929, according to his father, Cao Zichang, who used to be a mechanic in the Electricity Department of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, is now 71 years old, his life is difficult, and he is destitute. Since his son Yongkuan was injured and killed in an accident, he previously requested compensation from the authorities. More than five years have passed, and no compensation has been received.

(3) Letter to the American Consul: Regarding the case of Cao Yongkuan being injured and killed by a Naval Transport vehicle of your country in Shanghai on November 29, 1929, the authorities have transferred the matter to your Consul General for compensation according to law.

He is now 70 years old and destitute. He begs to transfer the letter to your Consul General for prompt payment of compensation in this case. After investigating the various allegations of Cao Zichang, the situation is indeed pitiable. We deeply hope that your Consul General will, based on the good friendship between our two governments and peoples, resolve this case satisfactorily. Not only will the relations between our two countries improve, but the reputation of your country's military will also increase. Based on the aforementioned situation, we hereby inform you and request that you investigate and handle the matter promptly. This is addressed to Mr. Clay Cosgrove, Consul General of the United States of America in Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e155">Liu Weishi Invents the Ring-Turning Three-Motion Electric Fan; The Ministry of Industry Has Approved a Five-Year Patent <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Liu Weishi is from Gansu, Minxian County, and graduated from the Department of Political Economy of the Gansu College. He usually loves improving industrial equipment and has been buried in research for eighteen years. He has successively invented the inclined leather live shaft cotton gin, water-powered cotton gin, new type ink machine, simple seeder, new type gas lamp, etc., which have been greatly appreciated by the Gansu authorities. With the assistance of Shao Lizi, he recently successfully invented a ring-turning three-motion electric fan, which has been reviewed by the Ministry of Industry and approved for a five-year patent. Mr. Liu often comes to Shanghai and signed a contract with the local Huasheng Electric Appliance Factory to manufacture and sell the fan, which was also approved by the factory. The reporter met with him at his residence yesterday and asked about the fan's structure and function. He replied, "The small table fans we usually use only blow air in one direction or turn halfway, which is very inconvenient, so I (Liu) was determined to research and have now succeeded. There are six special parts for ring-turning and four parts for connecting electricity. In addition to being fixed and shaking its head, it can also turn a full circle, hence the name 'three-motion'. At the same time, I also felt that the range of the wind power was very small, and the wind emitted in the hot summer was still hot, so I made further research and successfully developed a spiral-blade fan, which is to change the ordinary fixed blades into spiral blades that can swing left, right, up and down, so that the range of its wind power can be expanded to 7.5 times larger than the current one. It is currently being submitted to the Ministry of Industry for review." As for the fact that the emitted wind is still hot, he is currently studying the principle of absorbing heat and emitting cold air, and is quite confident. However, he is suffering from the difficulty of raising test materials. When these electric fans are successfully produced and he has sufficient economic resources, he will continue to complete the vibratory cotton gin and spindle spinning machine that he invented three years ago. He had tested it more than seventy times, spending tens of thousands of yuan, and his family property was also exhausted as a result. Unfortunately, all the tools and plans were destroyed by bandits. If these things can be successful, I believe they will greatly benefit the textile industry in the future, because the current general spinning machines require the cotton to be ginned and then carded, which must go through several processes from coarse to fine before being fed to the spinning machine. What I am researching is to eliminate several times of drawing fine, which I have made considerable progress on. What I am most worried about and cannot bear to let fail is that I, who study political economy, should come and talk about invention. Every experiment is ridiculed by many, but I do not give up because of this. I must seek the truth in everything and then stop. Failure is certainly ashamed, but an occasional success makes relatives and friends change their attitude towards me, which is somewhat comforting. The success of a career is never accidental. In fact, failure can also be said to be success, because if you do not fail, you will not know how to fail like this. This is what I often use to console myself."</p>

<p>200,000 Yuan in Funds to Be Established Within the Year; The Zhabei District Hall is Being Searched For</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Government held group weddings, people from all walks of life have approved of this economical method. The ceremony is grand, but for the large auditorium of the Municipal Government, it is inconvenient to travel to and from the city center. Therefore, Mayor Wu Tiecheng has planned to set up a group wedding hall in a suitable place in the South City and Zhabei, so that people in the north and south can hold weddings nearby. However, the construction and equipment costs of the hall are quite large. The funds are planned to be jointly borne by the government and local authorities. The Municipal Government convened more than ten gentlemen from Nanshi Yao Mulin, Zhang Xiaoliang, Lu Bohong, and Zhabei Wang Binyan, Jiang Huaishu, and Chen Bingqian for repeated discussions. As a result, for the funding issue, the Municipal Government is responsible for 60% and the local people are responsible for 40%. Both halls are to be established simultaneously within this year. First, the "Shanghai Zhabei District and Hunan District Auditorium Committee" will be organized, and the number of committee members will be solicited to over forty in order to gather strength and make it easy. According to Yao Mulin's words to the Guomin News Agency yesterday, the location of the Hunan District Auditorium has been selected to be rebuilt in Yishiyuan on Ninghe Road inside Dananmen, costing about 200,000 yuan. However, the garden is the property of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and it is still necessary to discuss with the provincial government. The location of the Zhabei District Auditorium is being searched for and will also be decided in the near future.</p>

<p>Another Letter Sent to Pig Traders Urging Swift Cancellation; Otherwise, They Will Not Be Recognized at Settlement.</p>
<p>The more than one thousand fresh meat businesses in the Shanghai International Settlement are in dispute over the extra charges levied by the pig traders in Wusong. The various meat industry guilds have repeatedly intervened to mediate, but the issue remains unresolved due to the traders' insistence. It is now learned that the meat businesses have again sent a letter to the various pig traders in Wusong, including Wan Shen, requesting a swift cancellation; otherwise, they will not be recognized at settlement. The original letter stated: "Gentlemen, our industry's request to cancel the extra charges is out of dire necessity. We appreciate your agreement at Dunren Hall on the 6th to reduce the pier fees and shop commissions by one-third and to sign a contract stating that this cannot be disputed in perpetuity. However, our industry's general assembly has resolved to comply despite reservations. According to the Nanshi side, these extra charges amount to only 23 cents per pig, with no pier fees or shop commissions. Now, your charges are 47 cents per pig, a significant difference. Our industry simply cannot afford this burden. As for the notification of 31 cents per pig issued by some of our industry members last month, this was due to a lack of understanding at the time. We request that you follow the same practices as your counterparts in Nanshi; otherwise, they will not be recognized at settlement. This letter is sent accordingly. We hope you will investigate and reply."</p>

<p>According to the official report of the Polk Company of America, after the efforts of November and December of last year, Chevrolet passenger cars once again led sales in 1934, exceeding the full-year sales of all other automobiles. The total number of sales for the year was 534,906 vehicles. At the end of October last year, Chevrolet passenger cars were more than 20,000 vehicles behind their main competitor. However, after selling more than 36,000 vehicles in November and more than 25,000 vehicles in December, they ultimately exceeded their biggest competitor by 11,675 vehicles. 1934 was the fourth consecutive year that Chevrolet passenger cars led sales and the sixth time in the last eight years. Chevrolet truck sales totaled 157,507 vehicles, also the highest of any brand. In 1934, Chevrolet's total sales of all types of vehicles were 692,413 vehicles, an increase of 118,040 vehicles compared to last year, with passenger car sales increasing by 60,413 vehicles and truck sales increasing by 57,617 vehicles. Chevrolet's ability to remain in the top spot last year was indeed due to its exceptional performance in the last six months of the year. While other manufacturers only sold 35% of their full-year sales during this period, Chevrolet was able to sell 49% of its full-year sales.</p>

<p>Wuxi County Magistrate Yan Yuyu, a scholar, has been in charge of the county government since being transferred from Shanghai County to Wuxi, and has now served for three years. He is diligent in his administration and loves the people, ensuring their peace and security. Recently, he suddenly became weary of his duties and resigned to the Jiangsu Provincial Government. The people of Wuxi telegraphed the Provincial Government to retain him and requested Ma Shaoquan, a fellow villager in Shanghai, to ask Chen Guofu, Chairman of the Provincial Government, to persuade him to stay. Mr. Ma sent a telegram to Chairman Chen in Zhenjiang today, which reads, "To Chairman Chen of the Zhenjiang Provincial Government: Magistrate Yan Shenyu has governed our county with simple policies and clear lawsuits, ensuring the peace and security of the people. We recently heard of his weariness of his duties, and the people are alarmed. At a time when disaster relief awaits management and dredging is about to begin, we rely on Magistrate Yan's experience and familiarity. Hearing of his resignation, the people of Wuxi feel as if they have lost their guardian. We telegraphed to urge him to stay. Although Shaoquan is living in Shanghai, this matter concerns our hometown, and I cannot restrain myself. I venture to plead with you to persuade him to stay. Sincerely, Ma Shaoquan, Executive Committee Member of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce."</p>

<p>Due to business expansion, the original premises of the Kang Yuan Can Factory's sales office at 121 Jiangxi Road were insufficient. On the 14th of last month, it moved to its new location at 247 Guangdong Road (at the intersection of Wuma Road and Qipan Street). To facilitate the purchase of the factory's products by citizens, it has added four retail stores to sell various types of tin cans, spring door locks, children's toys, colorful magnetic flower badges, soy sauce, rapeseed oil, and other products manufactured by the factory itself. The stores opened for business yesterday. The factory's tin cans are exquisitely crafted and durable, and have long been famous. The new products, such as toys and door locks, are extremely beautiful and durable, comparable to foreign goods, but the prices are low, less than half of those of foreign goods, and are highly praised by customers. Therefore, customers flocked to the company yesterday, and business was booming beyond expectations. It is also reported that the company did not hold an opening ceremony in order to practice the New Life Movement and promote frugality.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Yangzhou Fellow Villagers Association Indignant Over Circus Troupe Member Raping Chinese Woman <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Letter Sent to the Head of the French Police Department, Requesting Assistance from Various Organizations</p>
<p>The Yangzhou Bayi Fellow Villagers Association on Renji Lane, Xinzha Road, received a letter from fellow villager Yin Shengtao stating that his 13-year-old adopted daughter, A Pei, was raped by a member of the Isokko Circus Troupe, which recently came to Shanghai to perform, requesting assistance. An emergency meeting was convened, and personnel were dispatched to investigate. The association sent a letter to the Head of the French Police Department in Lujiawan, French Concession, yesterday and also sent letters to various public organizations, requesting their unified assistance. The contents of these letters are excerpted below.</p>
<p>Letter to the Head of the French Police Department:</p>
<p>"Sir, our member Yin Shengtao has reported to the association that his daughter, Peipei (aka A Pei), only 13 years old, was walking near the Isokko Circus Troupe's performance venue on the 2nd of this month when a Western member of the troupe sent a Chinese worker from the venue to lure the girl inside, where she was forcibly raped by the Western member. After Shengtao found her, he reported the incident to the police and brought the girl and the Chinese worker to the police station, where they confessed everything. Subsequently, Chinese and Western detectives took the girl and others to the scene of the rape at the theater and found important evidence. However, the police station, claiming that the troupe member was of Dutch nationality, stated that the evidence was insufficient and refused to accept the case. Shengtao is powerless and has sought the association's assistance. This troupe member's rape of a young girl is a disregard for humanity and is truly hateful. For the sake of prudence, we have ordered Yin Qitao to send the victim, Yin Peipei, to the Civilian Rehabilitation Center for examination. The girl's hymen has been ruptured, so it should not be considered that there is insufficient evidence. All members of our association are indignant upon hearing this. In addition to lodging a protest with the Dutch Consul, we hereby request you to provide the name of the Western member of the troupe so that legal proceedings can be initiated. We believe that this is a matter of public justice. Sincerely yours, Head of the French Police Department."</p>
<p>Letter to Various Organizations Requesting Assistance:</p>
<p>The association also sent letters to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the International Settlement, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the French Concession, the General Federation of Citizens of the First Special District, the General Federation of Citizens of the Second Special District, and various fellow villager associations, stating, "Gentlemen (text similar to above). All members of our association are heartbroken and outraged upon hearing this. We believe that your association, like ours, is composed of citizens, and who does not have a conscience or children? How can you bear to hear of such inhumane and beastly behavior? In addition to lodging a serious protest with the Consul of the country in question, we hereby request that your association uphold justice and provide unified support. We will be extremely grateful."</p>

<p>Zhou Xuewen Arrives in Shanghai to Negotiate. Over 5,000 Yuan in Relief Funds Needed.</p>
<p>Last year, Zhejiang Province suffered from a severe drought, resulting in crop failure. The five counties of Haining, Jiaxing, Haiyan, Chongde, and Tongxiang were particularly affected. Disaster victims flocked to neighboring areas to beg for food. Songjiang, which is connected to Zhejiang Province, was the first to bear the brunt. People of all ages lined the streets, causing not only a public order concern but also something that benevolent people could not bear to see. Zhou Xuewen, Chairman of the Songjiang Branch of the Red Cross, proposed that the association set up a camp to accommodate them. For three months, the camp accommodated over 16,000 people, consuming over 1,200 dan of rice. When they were sent off, each person was given cash. The camp had already closed last month, but refugees from Jiaxing and Jiashan continued to arrive in hopes of finding shelter. The association could not bear to see them abandoned by the roadside and reluctantly provided accommodation again, but finances were strained. Chu Huiseng from the All-Zhejiang Drought Relief Association sent personnel to distribute over 3,000 rice vouchers, and the Shanghai Provincial Drought Relief Association distributed 1,200 relief vouchers, totaling 1,200 dan of rice. The cost of other expenses such as medicine and timber was not insignificant. The camp has now been completely closed. It is estimated that over 5,000 yuan is needed. The association held its tenth economic review meeting at Chao Guo Temple the other day and resolved to request a subsidy from the general association and to reward the personnel who had worked hard. Yesterday, Chairman Zhou came to Shanghai from Songjiang to report to the general association and to contact major philanthropists in Shanghai to solicit donations.</p>

<p>Three Ships Arrive with Two to Three Thousand Squid Each.</p>
<p>Three ships carrying Northern Ocean Scale Pearl Squid arrived yesterday morning. The fish was distributed by Cui Sheng Fish Shop, managed by Xu Fashun, and Baofeng Fish Shop, managed by Shen Tongtai and Pan Xingshun. The three ships were all from Yancheng and were very small, with only two to three thousand squid on each ship. The price was 14.8 yuan per dan. Because this type of squid is fresh, flavorful, and popular in Suzhou, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Linping, and other places, fish shops in those areas sent people to Songjiang to purchase them in advance. The goods that arrived yesterday were quickly sold out. Over twenty ships of yellow croaker arrived yesterday, and the price was slightly higher than before. Because there was not much cargo and many buyers, the supply was less than the demand, and it is feared that the supply will be exhausted soon.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon at around 4 PM, a female corpse, about 30 years old, suddenly floated up in the pond of the Nine-Bend Bridge in the Yu Garden. It is not known when she drowned herself. Someone reported the incident to the Yu Garden Police Station, requesting an investigation. Police Chief Liu immediately dispatched Police Chief Li Hongqing to investigate. The corpse was recovered, but no family members came forward to claim it. The precinct chief then reported the incident to the local court for inspection. At around 5 PM, Prosecutor Xiao Jinying, accompanied by clerk Zhang Guowei and forensic doctors, arrived at the scene and determined that the unidentified female corpse had committed suicide by drowning. It was decided to have the charity organization collect the body and post photographs for identification.</p>

<h3 id="e178">More Than a Thousand Water Meter Covers Stolen from the Nanshi Water Company. Two Juvenile Offenders Apprehended Yesterday and Taken to the Bureau for Investigation. <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>According to Guomin News, the Shanghai Inland Water Company, located at 592 Bansongyuan Road, Nanshi, was founded by Yao Mulian and others and has been operating successfully for many years. However, since last month, the company has discovered that more than a thousand water meter covers installed on users' meters have been stolen. The loss is significant, affecting not only business but also public services. Therefore, the company reported the situation to the Municipal Public Security Bureau some days ago, requesting a thorough investigation and offering a reward in the newspaper. At the same time, it printed reward notices stating that anyone who could identify the thieves, report them to the company, and lead to their arrest, or who could catch them in the act with the stolen goods, would be rewarded accordingly. It is now learned that Officer Nie Shaowen of the Liyuan Road Police Substation of the Ximen Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau dispatched police officers at around 9 AM yesterday to apprehend two juvenile offenders who were stealing water meter covers inside Samsung Lane on Xiexu Road and took them to the substation for processing. Yao Mulian, the general manager of the company, learned of this and, together with Zhao Wenxiang, the business director, went to the Ximen Branch to request that the two children be transferred to a vagrant training center for supervision because they were acting under someone else's instructions. It is said that the bureau questioned them and then sent them to the General Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Ruling on盛毓常 (Shèng Yùcháng)'s Case of Being Sued by a Concubine: Sentence of Six Months, Suspended for Two Years <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>盛毓常 (Shèng Yùcháng), the eldest grandson of盛否蓀 (Shèng Fǒusūn), a former Palace Guardian and Minister of Posts and Communications in the late Qing Dynasty, originally from Changzhou, lived at No. 1, Danglu Road. Previously, through the introduction of his friend 苏石痴 (Sū Shíchī), he took 林玉金 (Lín Yùjīn), a Guangdong woman and prostitute, as a concubine. Later, because Lin (林) could not bear the schemes and oppression of Sheng's (盛) wife, she left on her own accord. For several years, due to the pressures of life, she worked as a dancer in the dance halls of Shanghai. After January 28th (referring to the Shanghai Incident of 1932), Sheng (盛) went to the dance hall to dance, and upon seeing Lin (林) again, he was reminded of their past affection. He generously agreed to take her back, renting a house downstairs at No. 191, Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, and they lived together again. Starting around April of last year, because Lin Yujin (林玉金) suffered from lung disease, Sheng (盛) suddenly abandoned her, disappearing completely. Lin (林) searched for Sheng (盛) several times but could not meet him. Helpless, Lin (林) engaged 江一平 (Jiāng Yīpíng), 华懋生 (Huá Màoshēng), and other lawyers to file a private prosecution against Sheng Yuchang (盛毓常) in the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court for abandonment. Based on the complaint, the court, through 章朝佐 (Zhāng Cháozuǒ), held several hearings, summoning both parties for interrogation and ordering Lin (林) to undergo a medical examination at the forensic medical office, confirming that she was suffering from lung and heart disease. The court adjourned the hearing and instructed both parties to attempt an out-of-court settlement. Subsequently, because the settlement failed, another hearing was held on the 4th of this month to continue the trial. The plaintiff, Lin Yujin (林玉金), suddenly requested to withdraw the attached civil suit, demanding that the criminal portion of the lawsuit be strictly handled according to the law against the defendant's abandonment. The defendant also engaged lawyers 山律 (Shān Lǜ) and 张鼎 (Zhāng Dǐng) for defense. The court instructed the lawyers of both parties to present their arguments, then announced the conclusion of the hearing and set a date for the verdict. Details of the case have been previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday was the date set for the verdict in this case. Both parties were represented by their lawyers who came to the court to await the outcome. Judge 章 (Zhāng) presided over the Fourth Criminal Division and delivered the judgment, stating that Sheng Yuchang (盛毓常) had abandoned a person without the ability to support themselves, whom he was legally obligated to support. He was sentenced to six months of imprisonment, with a two-year suspended sentence. After the verdict, the official briefly explained the reasoning behind the judgment and then adjourned the court.</p>

<p>Previously, a strike wave occurred at the 祥生 (Xiángshēng) Motor Company. Some drivers secretly met at Room 405 of the 大中 (Dàzhōng) Hotel on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession to conspire ways to deal with the company, intending to commit misconduct. The detective 杨德春 (Yáng Déchūn) of the Lao Zha station, together with detectives from the French Concession police, went to arrest 邱阿根 (Qiū Āgēn) and eight others. Yesterday, the Second District Court concluded the interrogation and awaited the verdict. This morning, Judge 冯世德 (冯世德) of the First Criminal Division took the bench and announced the judgment. 邱阿根 (Qiū Āgēn) and 蔡阿東 (Cài Ādōng) were each sentenced to 30 days of detention for using violence and coercion to obstruct others from exercising their rights. The number of days of pre-trial detention will be used to offset the sentence at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment, with a two-year suspended sentence. 萧子由 (Xiāo Zǐyóu), 陈荣林 (Chén Rónglín), 韩阿林 (Hán Ālín), 徐根生 (Xú Gēnshēng), 蔡阿東 (Cài Ādōng), 蒋阿宁 (Jiǎng Āníng), 廿新昌 (Niàn Xīnchāng), and 张方新 (Zhāng Fāngxīn) were all found not guilty of the assault charges. Police Lawyer 王耀堂 (Wáng Yàotáng) requested that the defendants remain on their original bail during the appeal period. The court granted the request.</p>

<p>杨国信 (Yáng Guóxìn), a Chinese constable with badge number 652 from Hebei Province at the Avenue Joffre Police Station, is 36 years old and lives at No. 46, Huaxing Fang, Baoding Road. In the fourth month of the lunar calendar two years ago, he married a woman from the same hometown, 阎氏 (Yánshì) (20 years old). However, before several months had passed, 阎氏 (Yánshì) suddenly left without notice, and her whereabouts were unknown. She also took away clothing and other items. Yang (杨) reported this to the Yangshupeilu Police Station. In May of last year, Yang (杨) learned that 阎氏 (Yánshì) was cohabitating with 左荣昌 (Zuǒ Róngchāng) at No. 9, Shuifu Li, Sanyang Road. He often went to arrest them, taking them to the police station, but they were dispersed after the police officer mediated. Then, as soon as 阎氏 (Yánshì) left the police station, she refused to go home with Yang (杨), claiming she was returning to her mother's home, and disappeared from then on. On the first of this month, Yang (杨) suddenly received an anonymous letter reporting that 阎氏 (Yánshì) was cohabitating with 蔡德和 (Cài Déhé), a man from Yangzhou, at No. 390, Zhoujiazui Road. After investigation, the report was confirmed. He reported it to the Jiaxing Road Police Station. Chinese detective 吕寿昌 (Lǚ Shòuchāng), along with Chinese constable No. 2723, rushed to the scene and arrested 阎氏 (Yánshì) and 蔡 (Cài), taking them to the police station. Cai (蔡) and 闫氏 (Yánshì) completely confessed to the facts of their adultery, and stated that they had initially cohabitated at No. 16, Wuyixing Li, Tongzhou. Since the detectives knew that they had a fixed residence, they immediately released them. Then, they requested the First Special District Court to issue a summons, and this morning Cai (蔡) and 阎氏 (Yánshì) were summoned to the Fifth Criminal Division. Police Lawyer 蒋保廉 (Jiǎng Bǎolián) prosecuted them for adultery under Article 256 of the Criminal Law. When questioned, Yang (杨) and 阎氏 (Yánshì) stated: "After marrying the plaintiff, the defendant (Yang) did not often come home because he thought I was ugly. My departure was forced by the plaintiff. After leaving, I made a living by washing clothes. However, I was heavily in debt. I met Cai (蔡) through washing clothes. Cai (蔡) paid off my debts for me, so I offered myself to him. We have been together for only five months." Cai Dehe's (蔡德和) statement was similar to Yan's (阎). After verifying their statements, Judge 叶圣超 (Yè Shèngchāo) declared in court that Yang (杨) 阎氏 (Yánshì) and 蔡德和 (Cài Déhé) would each be sentenced to two months of imprisonment as a warning.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipality Recruitment Headquarters of the Chinese Aviation Association, in order to raise an aviation national salvation army, held a music concert by the National Music Academy, with the proceeds to be used for aviation national salvation funds. 张裕良 (Zhāng Yùliáng), 陈硕 (Chén Shuò), 鲍冷雪 (Bào Lěngxuě), and others were assigned to prepare. Everything was ready. The performance was scheduled to begin at 8:15 PM on the 20th of this month in the auditorium of the New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road, as previously reported. It is said that the admission tickets were divided into three grades: special class at three yuan per ticket, first class at two yuan per ticket, and second class at one yuan per ticket. The ticket quotas have been distributed to various groups, schools, and recruitment team leaders throughout the city. Various groups and schools have submitted the ticket fees to the headquarters for counting according to the specified ticket quota. Each recruitment team leader was originally allocated one special class and one first class ticket per person. In addition to paying their shares, over a dozen team leaders, including Chen Heqin (陈鹤琴), team leader of the 87th team, Chen Peide (陈培德), team leader of the 61st team, and Zhu Shaoping (朱少屏), team leader of the 15th team, telegraphed yesterday requesting additional special class and first class tickets. The headquarters has dispatched people to deliver them separately. It is hoped that people from all walks of life in this city will actively participate. It is both entertaining and supportive of the aviation national salvation movement, truly killing two birds with one stone. However, there are not many seats available. Those who wish to attend should purchase admission tickets from the headquarters on the first floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA as soon as possible. For this music concert, Zhang Yuliang (张裕良) tentatively arranged for it to be performed at the New Asia Hotel auditorium.

<h3 id="e184">Red Swastika Society Organizes Emergency Relief for Anhui Province: A Large Number of Relief Workers Depart <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>The disaster situation in Anhui Province is dire, with widespread famine. Many people are using Guanyin powder, tree bark, and grass roots as food, causing their bodies to swell and becoming weak and unable to move. There are even reports of parents and children eating each other. These tragic situations are heartbreaking. Previously, the Southeast Branches of the Red Swastika Society and the Shanghai United Office jointly raised over 10,000 yuan in relief funds with branches in Qing, Xi, Chang, Yong and other places. They publicly appointed Zhou Genjing (周根净) and Liu Xichun (柳锡纯) as supervisors and convened a meeting in Anqing to organize an emergency relief society, allocate relief funds, and elect relief workers to go to Hefei and other counties to provide emergency relief. The counties being inspected by the society are listed below: Hefei County: Yuan Zantai (袁赞太), Wu Yuande (吴圆德); Guichi County: Dai Fu Yin (戴肤因), Liu Zhen (刘　眞); Dangtu County: Zhen Hua (　振华), Shi Yuanyuan (十元境); Tongcheng County: Shi Miaole (施妙乐), You You (　悠　); Wangjiang County: He Huili (何惠利), Wu Wuhe (吴呜和); Huaining County: Wu Ying (吴　　影), Hao Cheng (郝　成); Fanchang County: Liu Zhenyuan (刘珍源), Xin Shouyi (辛守依); Susong and Taihe Counties: Zhou Juesi (周觉蕬), Liu Shoujue (刘守觉); Dongliu County: Sun Gu (孙　榖), Wang Shou (王守　); Shidai, Qingyang, and Tongling Counties: Yue Qing (　月清), Gao Deyuan (高德源), Zhang Suding (张素定), Xu Shouhuan (徐守焕); Hanzhen County: Shen Zhongchong (沈钟冲), Zhou Yujue (周毓觉); Xuancheng, Langxi, Nanling, and Jing County: Shi Zhidao (十志道), Chen Kaicheng (陈开成); Qianyou County: Hunfa (　浑法), Shi Hunjian (石浑见). In addition, 1,000 yuan was subsidized for the Sanhe Congee Kitchen, and 500 yuan each was given to the Huoqiu and Lujiang Counties, to be distributed by the society's North Anhui office. It is also reported that all branches have been telegraphed to raise funds together in order to expand relief efforts. However, there has been excessive rainfall in the province recently, and most of the wheat crop has been damaged. According to relief workers, lives cannot be saved until the autumn grain harvest. The society's relief funds are limited, and it is hoped that benevolent people from all walks of life will raise funds to save the starving people from death. One yuan can save one life, and the merit is greater than building a pagoda.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee: Zhou Houjun Comes to Shanghai to Raise Relief Funds; Mayor Wu and Others Enthusiastically Support <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Houjun, a member of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, convened a relief meeting in Zhenjiang with representatives from the county governments, county party committees, farmers' associations, chambers of commerce, drought relief associations, and local charitable individuals from ten counties, including Liyang, Lishui, Jurong, Liuhe, Jintan, Gaochun, Jiangpu, Yixing, and Yizheng, due to the severe disaster situation. Zhou recently came to Shanghai to solicit donations. The reporter visited him and recorded his remarks as follows: In recent years, our country's rural areas have suffered from frequent natural and man-made disasters, compounded by the economic aggression of imperialists, and are teetering on the brink of collapse, a situation too painful to mention. Jiangsu is known as a fertile region, but even there, nine out of ten homes are empty and few families have any savings. Last year's severe drought was a calamity unprecedented in a century. The situation in counties such as Yi and Li, due to their high terrain, was even more severe. Ponds and lakes dried up day by day. The cracks in the ground were wide enough for carriages and horses to travel through. It is impossible to discuss planting, let alone harvesting crops. The farmers, seeing that there was no hope for survival, fled in all directions, eating in the wind and sleeping in the dew, selling their children and daughters. Now that the spring plowing season has arrived, they have returned crawling to their fields. However, when they inspect the fields, they have nothing to plow with, and after the drought, they have exhausted all their resources and have nothing to eat. They are digging up graves to eat corpses, swallowing stones to commit suicide, and starving corpses fill the fields. Their crying shakes the heavens. Houjun has been traveling to various places and has seen and heard these things with his own eyes. His heart is broken. Therefore, he convened a drought relief meeting of ten counties. Chairman Chen of the provincial government has decided to establish a poor people's loan office in each county to provide full relief efforts. The provincial party committee also plans to allocate the funds raised by party members in the past to relief efforts. However, the disaster area is tens of thousands of square miles wide, and the disaster victims number over a million. This is still a drop in the bucket and difficult to make a difference. Houjun has come to Shanghai to appeal for help. Fortunately, Mr. Wu Tiecheng, Xu Shiying, Du Yuesheng, Gu Xingxuan, Huang Jinrong, Wu Kaixian, Wu Xingya, and Pan Gongzhan have enthusiastically supported him. The Drought Relief Association and the Municipal Government have allocated 10,000 yuan, which will be sent this Saturday. Mr. Du Yuesheng and Wu Xingya have also agreed to personally solicit donations. These gentlemen, who are concerned about the suffering of others and have a charitable heart, are not only the saviors of the disaster victims in the ten counties of Yi and Li, but also the pillars of the nation and deeply worthy of respect. Zhou was very saddened when he spoke and also said that one yuan is enough to save a life. He sincerely hoped that the people of the metropolis would tighten their belts and rise up to provide disaster relief.</p>

<p>(1) Wang Qingfang, a Shandong native, was found by Detective Shen Kui of the Huizhaifang Police Station at around 9:00 PM the day before yesterday selling smuggled red pills, about 60, and a small packet of heroin powder near Sanguantang on Huazhai Road. Because he looked suspicious, they knew he was a red pill peddler. They bought a packet from him for five jiao and arrested him, along with the evidence, and took him to the police station. The police chief ordered him to be detained. Yesterday, he was brought before the Third Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Industry Bureau Lawyer Li Zhishan stated the facts and filed a public prosecution under Article 6 of the Drug Prohibition Law. He requested the court to present the red pills and heroin powder for inspection and to question the defendant. The defendant's testimony was evasive. Judge Zizi sentenced Wang Qingfang to six months in prison as a warning and ordered the confiscation and destruction of the evidence. (2) Constables No. 270 of the Hongkou Police Station arrested Lan Fusheng and Ding Lisheng, two Yong natives, on Zhoujiazui Road for selling smuggled red pills. Thirty-six red pills, a double-cornered coin, and more than 170 copper coins were found. They were taken to the police station and sent to the First Special District Court. After the interrogation was concluded, they were ordered to be detained and a date was set for the verdict. This morning, Judge Wu Zexing presided over the Criminal Division and sentenced Jian Fusheng to one year in prison and Ding Lisheng to six months. The number of days of pre-trial detention will be used to offset the sentence at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment, and the evidence will be confiscated.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Dancer's Abortion Death Case: Further Interrogation Awaits Witness Summons <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Chen Weida, the owner of the Weida Hotel at No. 993 Avenue Joffre and a native of Nantong, had a relationship with the dancer Bao Yuying, a native of Xuzhou. The woman was secretly pregnant and was worried about her dancing career. On March 4th of this year, she went to the old midwife Liu Wang at No. 73 Jiujiang Road for an abortion. Afterwards, she suffered internal injuries and became ill. Her father, Bao Zhenyuan, learned that she had become ill because of the pregnancy and abortion related to Chen. She was then sent to Guangren Hospital, but treatment was ineffective and she died on the 11th of the same month. Now, the woman's father, Bao Zhenyuan, has engaged a lawyer to file a private prosecution in the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court against Chen Weida for inducing fornication and hindering public morals. After Judge Li Changnian of the First Special Court held a hearing on October 25th, he ordered a change of date, pending the collection of the case file of Liu Wang from the First Special Court for review and summons of witnesses for further interrogation, as previously reported. Yesterday, another hearing was held and both parties were represented by lawyers. The official first briefly questioned both parties and then summoned Wu Changkai, a detective from the Xinzha Police Station, to the stand. After ordering him to take an oath, Wu testified that on March 11th, he was on duty at the Xinzha Police Station. At 5:00 PM, he received a phone call from Guangren Hospital reporting an abortion case involving a woman named Bao Huiying. The police chief immediately sent him to Guangren Hospital to investigate. According to Bao, she was still a Miss, not married. He asked her since she was not married, how did she get pregnant? She said she had a lover named Chen who ran a hotel on Avenue Joffre, but refused to say Chen's name, and asked him to ask her father, etc. He then returned to the police station to report. At 6:20 PM, Guangren Hospital called again, saying that Bao Huiying had died. He and a Western detective went to the Public Security Bureau on North Sichuan Road and notified the woman's father, Bao Zhenyuan. Later, because the abortion midwife lived next door to the Big Dance Hall on Sanma Road and was under the jurisdiction of the Laozha Police Station, the police chief transferred the case to the Laozha Police Station for handling. When he was inquiring about Bao Huiying at Guangren Hospital, there was also a doctor surnamed Yu standing by, listening to the conversation. The defendant absolutely denied having a relationship with Bao Huiying, saying that he had known her since last June when she was dancing. The witnesses Bai Xiuzhen and the maid Wang Amei had not arrived. According to the plaintiff Bao Zhenyuan, the witness Wang Amei has returned to her hometown of Lumu in Suzhou, and he has sent a letter to notify Bai Xiuzhen that he knows that his daughter and Chen were opening rooms at the Zha Hotel. The plaintiff's attorney requested a change of date and that the plaintiff be allowed to summon the witnesses for further interrogation. The court verified the statement and ordered a postponement until the third day of the month to summon the witnesses for questioning.</p>

In the future, we plan to actively carry out this policy to increase the number of chips in the market to maximize the benefits of turnover and circulation.</p>
<p>(6) Seek Close Cooperation among Banking Colleagues: The trend from competition to cooperation among banking colleagues is a major change in recent times, as mentioned earlier. Various production enterprises need funds. Taking cotton as an example, in the 23rd year, the national cotton production is estimated to produce more than 11 million dan of lint. At 40 yuan per dan, it requires more than 440 million yuan in funds. Other domestic raw materials are combined for calculation, and the amount of funds needed is even greater. Therefore, in terms of the amount of funds, if banks work together, they are still worried about the need for more supply and less demand, and there is no need for competition. There are also various specialized talents in business that are also extremely needed, but there are insufficient allocations. Furthermore, the equipment such as warehouses is handled by each bank individually, which is inevitably redundant and extremely uneconomical. Therefore, if they can cooperate effectively, not only will all investments be safe, but they will also be more in line with economic principles. The various cooperative businesses that were handled this year have been quite effective. In the future, we should still adhere to the main purpose of the group and seek closer cooperation. On the one hand, we should increase the types and scope of cooperative businesses. Those that are not suitable for cooperative methods should also be handled with a coordinated attitude.</p>
<p>The above are all business-related matters. There are also personnel and management aspects, such as talent cultivation, division of labor, and regional management, which should also be planned to make them suitable for the progress of business.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Judging from the situation in all aspects, the economic undertakings of our country have reached a critical juncture of life and death. The whole country, especially the financial world, should have a deep understanding and thorough awareness, stand firm, do practical work, and do our part. Regarding investment business, we must be able to divide the work and also be able to cooperate. It is not appropriate to engage in useless competition, and it is especially important to avoid everyone rushing to the same path. In other words, we should make planned investments. On the one hand, we should use the development of strength economically, and the allocation of chips should also be carefully planned. On the other hand, we should provide loans for production according to our ability, appropriately reduce deposit and loan interest rates, and support agriculture, while still promoting the development of industry, implementing production control, and preventing excessive price increases. In addition, we hope that (1) transportation will be developed, safety will be guaranteed, and taxes will be reduced, (2) land transportation costs will be reduced, and we will continue to strive for simplification, (3) industrial and commercial management will be scientific, and production and sales undertakings will be rationalized. The fundamental key lies in the people of the country doing their best and cooperating effectively, not relying on the assistance of others, not seeking temporary benefits, eliminating emotional effects, and promoting domestic production. Internal difficulties may be resolved, and external oppression may be avoided. The future is bright, and the prosperity of the banking business is also in this. How can it only be the bank's responsibility? (End)</p>

<h3 id="e201">Siamese Minister of Education Explains Absurd Statement on Suppressing Chinese Schools <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Reclaiming Forced Classes and Prohibiting Teaching of Party Doctrine - Weak in the Face of the Strong and No Restrictions on Other Countries</p>
<p>Bai Shangshalapapan, the Siamese Minister of Education, has caused unanimous opposition from overseas Chinese due to the implementation of assimilation policies by suppressing Chinese schools, which has led to many questions. However, the minister has resorted to sophistry and issued a statement explaining the suppression of Chinese schools, which is extremely absurd and infuriating. The reporter of the Industry and Commerce Society has specially transcribed the original text of the statement as follows:</p>
<p>Unwilling to Allow Other Countries to Seize Educational Power</p>
<p>(1) The principle of education is that each country has the sovereignty to achieve its educational goals and is unwilling to allow the people of other countries to arbitrarily and privately have the special right to run education. Similarly, China is the same as Siam. The same formula is to preserve the sovereignty of implementing education in the country and not allow overseas Chinese (no matter whether they are overseas Chinese or overseas Chinese from other countries who have this kind of special right). (2) The implementation law of education in Siam has been clearly promulgated, and there are laws and regulations related to the implementation of education, namely (A) the Private School Regulations (Buddhist calendar 1461), (B) the Compulsory Education Regulations (Buddhist calendar 464).</p>
<p>Turning the Compulsory Classes to Be Run by the Ministry</p>
<p>(3) All private schools, whether they are Chinese schools, Siamese schools, or schools founded by overseas Chinese from other countries, should be run in accordance with the above-mentioned education regulations. The Ministry of Education has not strictly restricted the schools, such as allowing Chinese schools to teach the courses stipulated by the Ministry of Education. In the past, the Ministry of Education also allowed Chinese teachers who had not participated in Siamese language training to serve as teachers during school learning time, so that the schools could be maintained to this day. This kind of thing shows that Chinese schools enjoy special rights more than Siamese schools. The Ministry of Education also takes a tolerant attitude towards the management of private schools. For example, if Chinese schools have mistakes, they are treated with the same attitude. The Ministry of Education is infinitely grateful for the good intentions of the Chinese directors and teachers for establishing schools in the country and enlightening the children of the country (the children enrolled by the Chinese are all children of overseas Chinese) and being able to consistently do good deeds to this day. Therefore, the Ministry of Education often provides various conveniences within the scope of the law, but when there is no way to forgive, I hope that the Chinese and Chinese schools can understand that the Ministry of Education should not have an attitude of only caring about one side.</p>
<p>Forcing Chinese Children to Learn Siamese</p>
<p>(4) When compulsory education is promulgated and implemented in various places, it is implemented in accordance with the regulations. Except for the districts where the Ministry of Education has raised the compulsory age to eight or nine years old, all boys and girls within the compulsory age, from seven to fourteen years old, should attend classes in compulsory schools (that is, schools run by Siam) and go to school in accordance with the compulsory education regulations. This is the principle of Siam implementing compulsory education. Therefore, in the areas where compulsory education regulations have been promulgated, private schools of overseas Chinese from various countries, if they want to enroll children of compulsory age, must be in accordance with the provisions of various compulsory education regulations and teach according to the compulsory education curriculum. As for the Chinese schools, because a foreign language subject (that is, Chinese and English) is inserted in the middle of the curriculum, if the compulsory education regulations are strictly implemented, the Chinese schools will not be allowed to enroll children of compulsory age (that is, Chinese children aged seven to fourteen). However, the Ministry of Education has not forgotten the good intentions of the Chinese schools in Siam and education, so it allows the Chinese schools to adopt courses equivalent to the compulsory education curriculum and allows them to teach in foreign languages. This can be said to be a special courtesy of the Ministry of Education to all Chinese schools in the country.</p>
<p>Not Allowed to Teach Party Doctrine Textbooks</p>
<p>(5) If the Chinese schools can abide by the implementation of the Ministry of Education and the education regulations, they will be given various benefits and receive considerable assistance from the Ministry of Education. However, the fact is not the case. Most Chinese schools take advantage of this opportunity to teach various other courses and political doctrines (that is, the Three Principles of the People textbook) and do not teach courses related to various appropriate courses, such as vocational education or other courses. The teaching of political doctrines is not within the scope of courtesy. Therefore, the Ministry of Education, which is responsible for organizing education and maintaining common interests, has to stop this kind of treatment for the schools. (6) The above-mentioned non-compliant actions of the Chinese schools will inevitably affect the inability of children to achieve the goals of the compulsory regulations. In order to seek common interests and enforce the law, the Ministry of Education has no choice but to withdraw the education power. (The Chinese schools enroll children of overseas Chinese, and there are no Siamese children in them. The Ministry's withdrawal of education power is even the education power of China,) It is absurd to withdraw it together.)</p>
<p>British, French, and Other Overseas Chinese Are Not Subject to This Example</p>
<p>(7) As for the actual situation of the schools violating the regulations, after questioning some of the directors who run the Chinese schools, it was found that the purpose of establishing the Chinese schools was only to enable children to learn Chinese. If teachers teach students political doctrines, they are also dissatisfied and even disappointed. This investigation result shows that some of the directors of the schools have not participated in this illegal behavior. The Ministry of Education is very grateful for this kind of good intention and hopes that other directors of the schools can understand this matter and cooperate with the Ministry of Education so that this matter can achieve a complete result in accordance with the provisions of the compulsory education regulations. This shows that the Ministry of Education has not, as the general rumors say, implemented the closure of Chinese schools and hindered the behavior of Chinese children from reading Chinese. On the contrary, the Ministry of Education will find ways to enable the children of all Chinese to read Chinese. Even Siamese children have the opportunity to learn Chinese. For example, in order to facilitate some merchants, the Ministry of Education also has a Chinese language course in schools run by the government. All Chinese who have lived in Siam for a long time and newcomers enjoy the same treatment as Siamese under the same law and the same regulations. (Overseas Chinese from Britain, France, the United States, and Japan who live in Siam are generally not subject to this treatment by the Siamese government.) The Dong schools and Siamese schools are prescribed in the same law, and Chinese schools should enjoy various special conveniences such as those mentioned above compared to other Siamese schools.</p>
<p>Restrictions on the Use of the Chinese Language</p>
<p>The restricted use of the Chinese language is what the Ministry of Education should pay special attention to in the management of education in Siam. For the education of children of compulsory age, and those under the compulsory education age or have exceeded the compulsory education age, the private schools may teach foreign languages in accordance with the provisions of the National School Regulations. This has been given considerable rights. The Ministry of Education has stated above that it allows the Chinese schools to use courses equivalent to the compulsory education curriculum and allows them to use foreign languages (that is, use the Chinese language) for teaching. However, this is only a courtesy outside the law and is actually an aid in the early stages of the schools. However, later it was felt that this kind of treasure was used by the schools to teach political doctrines, which violated the compulsory education regulations. Therefore, the Ministry of Education took on the actual responsibility of management so that it could be implemented in accordance with the regulations. If the schools can run in accordance with the laws, the Ministry of Education officials will give them various conveniences. According to the above reasons, all Siamese and Chinese believe that the Ministry of Education's withdrawal of education power this time is based on legal principles and there is no forced behavior. The Ministry of Education is responsible for the management of national education, so it has to be responsible for preserving and maintaining it, so that it can be implemented in accordance with the track of the compulsory regulations and the national education policy, and achieve perfection, hoping that students can understand their responsibilities and seek development for themselves, their country, nation, religion, and constitution.</p>

<p>The first step of the Ministry of Education's work on compiling university curriculum standards, the syllabus and equipment standards for university medical colleges and medical schools, have been repeatedly met by the Medical Education Committee hired by the Ministry. Each member has been assigned to draft and revise the syllabus for more than half a year. Now, the members in charge of compiling the draft have submitted their papers separately. The Ministry of Education has compiled all the manuscripts sent by the members, and the staff in the Ministry will make the final adjustments. It is not necessary to invite external members to meet again. After the adjustments are completed and approved by the Minister, the syllabus of this medical college and medical school can be announced in May of this year (not as complicated as the curriculum standards for primary and secondary schools, so this curriculum standard can be said to be a curriculum syllabus), strict equipment standards, and it is heard that the second step of compiling the university curriculum will be to start with the industrial category, namely, the colleges of engineering and agriculture, followed by the colleges of liberal arts, law, education, and business.</p>

<p>(Beiping, 8th) Ren Hongjun discussed that the board of directors of the China Cultural Foundation felt quite difficult in this annual meeting to allocate funds, because the income for this year has sharply decreased, and the self-run and co-run businesses have been tightened. However, in order to balance income and expenditure, this is a last resort. As for the funds that can be allocated for subsidies, there are only more than 300,000 yuan, and the amount requested by various parties is very large, and most of the subsidized institutions are the original subsidized ones. Even the number has been reduced, such as the Geological Survey Institute has been reduced to 96,000 yuan, the Science Society's Product Research Institute has been reduced to 48,000 yuan, the Central History and Language Research Institute has been reduced to 25,000 yuan, and Nankai University has been reduced to 20,000 yuan. In addition, there are still several institutions that cannot continue. Furthermore, the suggestion from the outside world on the original fund used by the foundation has now been decided that the basic interest will not be used during the fund allocation period.</p>

They should be rectified as soon as possible, and the existing physical and chemical instruments and medicines should be registered and reported to the department for examination. The practice fees stipulated by the pre-specialized schools are often used for other purposes. In the future, the equipment of physics and chemistry should be enriched as much as possible, and the money should not be moved. The teachers of junior high school chemistry should conduct experiments at any time during class, and should not just hold the textbook and talk empty talk.

<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>The organization of Baojia (neighborhood watch system) is meant to train the populace to collectively organize for self-defense. Since its implementation, I've heard that the local organization of youth matters is progressing smoothly. However, there is one matter in the current third phase of work that the common people do not quite understand. That is, on the joint guarantee form, the Jia head and household head should both press their "fingerprints." Because of this, the gentlemen serving as Bao heads are suffering, spending much effort on promotion and persuasion. Those who are shrewd and clever, knowing the difficulties of the task, rush to resign in order to avoid trouble. What is the reason? When the villagers hear that they have to press "fingerprints," they are all terrified, saying, "We have not committed any crimes, nor have we engaged in selling wives and children. Why should we press 'fingerprints' and suffer this humiliation?" From this, it can be seen that the nation has not yet reached a sufficient level. It is truly not easy to implement the country's laws and decrees to the entire populace and to deeply ingrain them into the minds of the majority.</p>
<p>Speaking of the countryside, this is indeed the case. But if we look at the city, then it's completely different! For example, in our Jiading area, several Bao heads in the city, perhaps suspecting that some people are doubtful and hesitant, press their own "fingerprints" first to promote it. So yesterday, I saw several joint forms covered with "fingerprints," which was quite a sight to behold. Those trying to avoid it privately are truly a minority. This is perhaps a difference between the city and the countryside! But the "fingerprints" that are pressed, it's a pity that there is little research done on them. Natural ink is used, but because the texture is too heavy, it's either too dry or too wet. Some people press too hard, resulting in a blurry ink mess, not only failing to show the lines, but even tearing the paper when the finger is lifted. Pressing too lightly, on the other hand, doesn't even leave a mark on the paper. Moreover, the grid on the joint form is very narrow. Under a household head's name, if you just press randomly, wouldn't that cause confusion? Therefore, after seeing this procedure, I am reminded that the science of fingerprinting should also be studied. If there is no experience, a sudden attempt to implement it will inevitably feel somewhat lacking.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Eulogy for Mr. Yang Dunfu <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Xu Wo Sheng</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Dunfu supported me from the time I founded the family industrial cooperative, and was especially close to Xiaodie. The night talk with wine in the Zui Ling Xuan two years ago further revealed his ancient spirit. Now that he has returned to Dao Mountain, I first offer two elegiac couplets on behalf of my two brothers, Xiaochao and Zongcheng, this is the sorrow after three sighs.</p>
<p>Words cannot fully express my feelings, may his spirit be aware.</p>
<p>We knew each other for two generations, eighteen years of fleeting time, but in recent years, I often lamented that meetings were few and separations were many, let alone being separated by death from now on.</p>
<p>I toil with a cup of sorrowful elegy, tracing back the 5,000 words of morality, and wanting to express myself fully, I always feel that affection is long and paper is short, is it possible to share a cup of wine again?</p>
<p>Elegiac couplet on behalf of Mr. Jin Zongcheng</p>
<p>I worked with you for more than twenty years, correcting my faults like a father and son, reducing my mistakes like a sage, upright, honest and knowledgeable, I have benefited indeed not shallowly. Who knew that destiny is hard to defy, a long life of one hundred and eight years is only halfway through.</p>
<p>Thirteen years older than me, your dignity like a teacher and friend, your affection like brothers, good and bad you always discerned, our mutual understanding only grew deeper. Who would have thought that saying goodbye on Sunday, the thousands of treasured moments would end in a long farewell.</p>
<p>Elegiac couplet on behalf of Brother Tu Xiaochao</p>
<p>We became friends in childhood, forty-eight years until now, relying on each other like jade trees. Unexpectedly, minor misfortune occurred, and from then on, immortals and mortals are eternally separated.</p>
<p>We shared hearts and were in harmony, more than two thousand days older than me, nurturing each other no different from sworn brothers. Thinking of the many troubles in the Central Plains, why not detach and rest in peace.</p>
<p>Du Juan's Note: Elegiac couplets are the most difficult to compose, valuing sincerity of feeling and clarity like spoken words, not to be used for others. Die Lao (Elder Butterfly) has long been skilled in this, but regrettably he has often not left drafts. Now these three couplets are all for one person, from one hand, but each has its own feelings, lingering with endless grief. As the poem says: "Others have intentions, I measure them," is this not what it means? Recently, couplets are often stiff and empty, I record this to show a model for scholars, or not to be嫌d for merely occupying space.</p>

<p>— (Bo Guang)</p>
<p>The long snake-like Ping Mountain ridge, stretches for tens of miles, planted all over with bright red roses. Many village girls, in twos and threes, huddle among the rose bushes, picking roses that are still budding.</p>
<p>The clear and warm sunlight, shining on their bodies, feels prickly and unbearable, so they have already stripped off their cotton jackets, leaving only a single shirt, which is still wet with sweat under their arms.</p>
<p>The color of the roses is so beautiful, set off by the deep green tender leaves, they appear even more delicate and charming; and there is a faint fragrance, how can one not love them.</p>
<p>Although they are village girls, some of them are symbolic of roses, with healthy bodies, innocent faces, shy expressions... In the rose-picking season, some frivolous young men from the neighborhood, especially run there, chatting with them with glib tongues and thick faces. The more experienced village girls scold them, isn't this like roses having thorns?</p>
<p>After the roses are picked, they are sold in whole loads to stores that specialize in collecting roses. But they originally have to go through the hands of female workers, dried and sorted. Then they are resold to pastry shops, candy shops, to be made into food, it is truly fragrant to eat.</p>

<p>This county is even poorer than Shen County, and he was assigned to a township elementary school. The salary there is so small that it would make Westerners laugh their teeth out, it was originally two silver dollars a month. Zhou Yourong said: Although I have been in Shaanxi for so long, I did not expect elementary school teachers to have such hardship. But here there is a problem. May I ask, with two dollars a month, is it enough to drink water, enough to eat pot cakes? Even if he is very frugal, he definitely cannot teach on an empty stomach. Hokkaido: Naturally the salary is so low that it is only two dollars a month, we cannot ask the teacher to provide their own food. In fact, the food in the countryside is only two dollars a month. Altogether, including salary and food, it is about less than five dollars. May I ask, what kind of treatment is this? My relative taught for a semester, and felt that this was no different from begging for food. In the end, he resolutely resigned and quit. Zhi Qian said: He resigned and quit, did someone else take over? Hokkaido: Of course. Zhou Yourong laughed: Your relative is unwilling to beg for food, but others are willing to beg for food? Bei Hai laughed: Here there is naturally a qualification problem, my relative has after all spent two years in middle school, he felt that earning two dollars a month was not worth it. But there are those who have not entered the gate of middle school, they earn two dollars a month in the Northwest, then it is quite worth it. Zhi Qian said: You said those who have not entered the gate of middle school, can elementary school graduates also come out to be teachers? Bei Hai laughed: This must be said separately. It is certainly not very suitable to have not entered the gate of middle school, some have not even stepped into the gate of elementary school, and just know a few lines of poetry "Confucius said," and generally want to come out to teach.

<h3 id="e234">Records of the Lingering Fragrance of the Imperial Incense <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Everyone was wearing full court attire, as beautiful as a cluster of flowers, a pile of brocade; this scene, which I had long watched without getting tired of, but today I could not arouse any interest, on the contrary I felt that their actions were too slow, delaying our important matter of going to see the dogs, and I could not help but urge them loudly. I stole another glance at the Empress Dowager, only to see that she also seemed very anxious, speaking much more urgently than usual, all the memorials, she did not look at any of them in the court, only ordered the eunuchs to collect them and talk about it later.</p>
<p>However, this morning court could not be too hasty after all, it still had to take a considerable amount of time to end. After it was over, we all accompanied the Empress Dowager back to the inner palace together, first letting her hurriedly change into a set of lighter clothes for walking, and then everyone, according to the usual order, formed a scattered line, bustlingly crowding around the Empress Dowager, bypassed a corner of Longevity Hill, and went straight to the imperial doghouse. The location of this imperial doghouse was just to the left of the workshops of various artisans that I mentioned in the previous chapter, and it was closest to the silk-making workshop, but they were still one or two hundred paces apart! Along the way, the Empress Dowager also told me a lot about the situation of the dogs that we were going to visit now.</p>
<p>"Ah! Don't underestimate them too much!" This was one of the Empress Dowager's catchphrases, as if her things were all unbelievably great. "They also have a very long history: at first they also came from outside the pass like us, their original name was Haba dogs, this is the Manchurian local name, now very few people mention it."

<h3 id="e235">Impressions of the Women's Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Long Sao</p>
<p>The Chinese Women's Calligraphy and Painting Association has collected many works by purely female artists, and has been publicly exhibiting them at Lake Society these days. If we think about it in terms of its name, it is indeed worth our attention. In the ancient capital of culture—Beiping, in Guangzhou, the birthplace of revolution, in Wuhan, where higher education is active, in Hangzhou, the scenic traffic area, and in Kyoto, the center of political negotiation: it seems that we have not heard of any women who love calligraphy and painting organizing groups to study this kind of art. But now, the "Chinese Women's Calligraphy and Painting Association," centered on Shanghai, has gathered the artworks of women from all walks of life, and displayed them together in one place, which is really not an easy thing, especially since this is the first time!</p>
<p>It is not easy to produce a new art group and continue to operate with an independent spirit, completely maintained by women; as for the evaluation of their products, I personally think that it is not necessary to use modern trends to harshly say that they are too classicist, full of longing for hermit life, too lacking in social reality, and neglecting those noble nonsense of "the object of the masses" for the time being. Therefore, based on this position, I do not want to expound on modern art theory, but just want to simply talk about their products and style.</p>
<p>There: Like the landscape paintings of Zhu Renyan, Zhang Youfen, Huang Bingqing, Fan Songfen, and Xu Lengcui, they all rely on talent and skill, so the composition does not fall into fixed patterns. Gu Qingyao imitated Shi Xi in one painting and Xin Luo in six paintings, not only are they exquisite and profound, but the charming charm, like a light and agile wind, writes out her personal poetic feelings. Wu Qingxia's figures have the meaning of Huangshan Shou. Xie Yingxin's "Red Cliff Night Tour" and Bao Yahui's "Returning Home from Spring Outing" both have a fresh and elegant flavor. He Yiru imitated Da Chi, and Lu Xiaoman's small landscape painting is simply a work in the style of the Song and Yuan dynasties, like a beautiful palace poem, the posture is full of quiet leisure. Zhao Hanying, Liu Fangqiong, He Xiangning, and Jiang Yanan, etc., are all clear, elegant, vigorous, and the ink brush and coloring are all good. Li Qiujun's six-foot "Flower Shadow Blowing Sheng" and figure screen are painted in an antique, beautiful, bright, and well-proportioned layout. The landscapes she paints are also strangely comfortable to look at. Bao Qiongxiao and Mao Suihua's two paintings of beautiful women are elegant and delicate, and the landscapes are colored with blue and green, the method is close to Qiu Nong. Chen Xiaocui's "Wildcat Hunting Scroll," "Lychee Fragrance Near," and "Autumn Grave Ghost Singing Picture" needless to say have a graceful and refined charm, just like her poetic style; and she also writes a good hand of calligraphy. Tang Guanyu's flowers and birds, the brushwork is clear and refined. Ding Yunbi's grass insects, precisely because they are unkempt and roughly dressed, are even more beautiful and wonderful. Pang Zuoyu's "Willow Pond Picture" and "Late Autumn Picture" have the style of Bai Yang. Li Hua's White Eagle Picture is extremely ancient and elegant, I am afraid it cannot be regarded as a rare treasure in modern painting. Huang Quan's chrysanthemums, a total of twenty-four paintings, are vividly written and also rare and wonderful ink works. Zhou Lianxia's small painting of ink orchid is delicate and lovely, with inscriptions by Xiaocui, Qiujun, and Qingyao on it, it is indeed a collaborative masterpiece. Xu Hui's landscape three-foot screen, the ink rhyme is deep and moist, shining together with Jin Qiusheng and Yao Xinhua's clear, transcendent, simple and unadorned.</p>
<p>As for calligraphy, Feng Wenfeng has the most couplets, with great power. Jiang Daofan's seal or official script is also vigorously powerful. Wu Zhangzhu's imitation of Zhang Heinu is very similar in spirit, with only one work on display. Yang Xuejiu's three-foot screen, the ink is full and saturated, and the sweeping and dripping is almost no different from the wrist strength of a reckless man. In addition, Gu Qingyao's green stone seal carving and Zhang Renzhi's bamboo carving are also exhibited. Even if they are appendages, on this side seat, we can find their deep love for art. If we must find shortcomings, it lies in the fact that all the products inevitably fall into the consciousness of imitating the ancients, and neglect the spirit of modern artistic creation. It is hoped that the third exhibition will give us realistic portrayals that reflect real life and the fresh and lively stimulation of the progress of upward consciousness!</p>

<p>According to a report by New Zealand &amp; China, Ltd., yesterday (8th), the New York stock market rose sharply, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average created the highest record since 1931. The market closed strong and fast, apparently due to a mixture of inflation concerns and investment needs. Small exchange stocks rose under the leadership of oil and mining stocks. The market was also very active, with a total daily turnover of 1.39 million shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e241">Yarn and Cotton: Spot Yarn and Cotton Transactions Few <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the 5/9 National Humiliation Day. The yarn, cloth, and cotton markets were closed for the day. However, spot yarn merchants still gathered as usual, but there were fewer attendees in the market. Southern demand for coarse yarn continued to be smooth, with buyers from Yunnan and Guangdong being the most numerous. However, selling prices remained unchanged. Statistics for purchases by various groups for the whole day totaled 793 bales. The market was similar to the previous day. Purchases by each group were as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong 425 Yunnan 340</p>
<p>Luzhou 10 Inland 7</p>
<p>Ningbo 1 Shantou 10</p>
<p>The cotton market remained mediocre. Because American and Indian cotton markets showed mixed rises and falls, the trend was very uncertain. And the standard gold market price fell again. However, general cotton merchants were holding large quantities of futures contracts, anticipating higher prices. According to partial investigations, outside cotton merchants had pulled in quite a lot at previous peaks. Currently, rumors are circulating about increasing import duties on foreign cotton. Therefore, in recent days, they have come back in force and bought more to increase their positions. However, according to the facts, 40-50% of the cotton stored in the production areas has not yet been shipped out. Factories that have closed down have no hope of resuming work. Recent news indicates that factories in Taicang, Jiangyin, and other places in the interior have also stopped operations. The demand for raw cotton will naturally shrink. Investigations show that recent spot cotton transactions remain quiet. The future of the cotton market is not to be overly optimistic about.</p>
<h3 id="e242">Speculative Cotton Futures Expanding Daily <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>Sellers are foreign merchants and speculators; buyers are mainly cotton merchants</p>

After netting out the long and short positions, there was a net storage of 280,500 dan. In recent days, the cotton market has been trending upward because the weather in the north is too early. A certain firm was entrusted to switch from short to long, and some bulls increased their positions. The largest long and short positions are listed below (unit: dan):</p>

<h3 id="e243">US Cotton Initially Falls, Then Rises Back to High; Egyptian Cotton Fields Similar to Last Year <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market opened lower due to foreign merchants selling and long positions being liquidated, as well as disappointing news from Liverpool. Prices for all months fell by 5 to 9 points. Subsequently, with Johnston's claim that he was unwilling to sell his stockpiled cotton in the current situation, market prices rebounded. At the same time, the stock market was firm. Unfavorable weekly weather forecasts also contributed to the fall and subsequent rise. However, the weather situation has eased as the rainy areas cleared up. Scarcity of old cotton and buying by dealers and short-sellers caused a rally. Finally, some positions were liquidated, resulting in slight weakness. The spot price rose by 10 points, old cotton rose by 8-9 points, and new cotton rose and fell by 1-2 points. According to exchange news, in April, excluding Oklahoma, nine states sold a total of 609,000 tons of fertilizer, compared to 669,000 tons in the same period last year. The British cotton spot price fell by one point, and futures rose by two points. The Indian cotton market initially strengthened due to buying by Japanese merchants, but later fell back due to long positions being liquidated for profits. The Pingle rose by 0.25 rupees, the Oomra rose and fell by 1 rupee, and the Broach fell by 0.25 to 2.75 rupees. The original telegrams are recorded below (8th telegram):</p>

<p>An 8th Alexandria telegram states: According to today's official report, Egyptian cotton fields have been completely planted. The area of cotton fields has not changed much compared to last year. Planting has regressed.</p>
<h3 id="e244">Grains: Rice Prices Remain Weak <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>Flour and wheat futures trading suspended; red grains alone show a firm market</p>
<p>Foreign rice continues to arrive at the port, and several ships of inland rice are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai soon. However, merchants in Shanghai and along the Yangtze River and North China are observing cautiously, perhaps intending to sell off their stockpiles. However, inland demand remains active, so the market is weak but slightly stable. Imported rice from various places continues to be purchased, and the source of supply is increasing. The market is therefore not as uniquely stable as before. Today, 12,000 bags of foreign rice were offered, as well as 2,000 bags of inland rice, and 400 bags of Kehsien rice. Shanghai merchants are slightly purchasing high-grade Saigon and small grain rice, with the rest being purchased by inland merchants.</p>
<p>For glutinous rice, sources from Hu-Bei and He-Xia on the 11th and 12th yesterday; The markets were quiet as could be, the most sluggish that there had ever been. Although some were seeking sales at shorted prices, there were only a few receivers, and so few transactions came of it. Market prices of White glutinous rice dipped 12 jiao, Thin Early Rice dipped a bit more than 2 jiao, Early Rice dipped 23 jiao, White Round Rice dipped less than a jiao, while all others dipped 1 jiao. Yesterday, sources for gangs in South-Hu were slightly less frequent than before. (Only 30 some, 6,000 units of goods), and sales continued as usual, and so, the market color was difficult to revitalize. As such, South-Harbor Early Rice continued to dip nearly 1 jiao, while all late rice dipped further from the hundred packages, falling outside of range. As for Su-Tong glutinous rice, this was sold at the rate of 2,000 units at Chao-Wu markets by stores, and people’s hearts were more stable, so that the market bear was about level in reality. Shady change units did not have much ups and downs.</p>
<p>The reason for the quiet and brisk market for red grains is mainly due to the high prices of grains in Dalian, and Japanese merchants are ceaselessly buying in Shanghai. Moreover, during this period of brewing, some inland, Pudong, and other wineries are buying, causing the market price to rise sharply. In addition, there is no existing inventory, so it can only be sold as it arrives. Yesterday, transactions included two cars of Haozhou grain at a price of 3 yuan, two cars of Bengbu grain at a price of 2.98 yuan, and one car of Tanxikou grain at a price of 3.19 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, for the 5/9 National Humiliation Day, both the flour and miscellaneous grains exchanges were closed. The following are the telegraphic reports of the small wheat market outside the Customs:</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat May 7th May 8th Change</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the sugar market, because Customs Gold Units tightened again and the tax increase seemed certain, the market sentiment was firm and rising again. The association's official quotation for 24 Dutch standard raw white spot was raised by 1.8 jiao to 16.7 yuan, but no transactions occurred. Transit goods rose by 1.5 jiao, with 400-500 bags changing hands at 5.6 yuan. Taikoo Sugar's B mark rose by nearly 1 jiao, with 200 bags changing hands at 17.37 yuan. The factory's refined white Zhenyu No. 1 was initially quoted at 16.2 yuan, then changed hands at 1 jiao, No. 2 at 16 yuan, No. 3 at 15.85 yuan, and No. 4 at 7 jiao. Only the Jian group offered more than 100 large bags of tribute ice, and the price had previously dropped to 21 yuan due to raw sugar and white sugar price drops. Yesterday, it was heard that all had been sold at that price, which was 3-4 jiao better than the lowest price.</p>

<p>Black melon seeds, because of the continuous sales in Fujian and Guangdong, the inventory in the market gradually became thin. Therefore, sellers repeatedly bought in, and the market became very tight. This newspaper previously predicted at a low price that it would definitely rise to 10 yuan in the future, and that goal has now been reached. Yesterday, high-grade Xukui seeds opened at 10.02 yuan, an increase of 3 jiao from the previous price, and the base was extremely firm.</p>

<p>The silk industry, which has been lingering in desolation, has not yet shown any improvement. Telegrams from British and French firms have not brought any changes, and the local silk stocking factories are also very sluggish. Therefore, both the silk and silk fabric industries seem to be in a state of stagnation. The dying silk market is now only waiting for the excitement of new Xinjiang silk coming onto the market, which may be able to slightly invigorate it. However, it is also difficult to say.</p>
<h3 id="e248">Large Quantity of Keemun Black Tea Arrives in Shanghai <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Zhongxin Chang, Yongxinglong, Qianji, and other tea warehouses transported 17 shipments of first-batch Keemun black tea from Hangzhou, totaling more than 1,300 boxes. Samples should be available today. The green tea market is trading quite actively. Zhuanmei green tea from the Suian road area is being heavily purchased by Xiehe, Yihuo, Jinlong, Tianwang, and other foreign firms due to the urgency of the shipping schedule. Zhuanmei green tea from local Zhuang, Huzhou, and other road areas is also being sold as soon as it arrives. The market price remains stable.</p>
<h3 id="e249">Piece Goods: Black Carbon Interlining is Expensive <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>Black carbon interlining, which is essential for the lapels and facing of Western suits, has seen a sharp reduction in the import of imported goods since the Ningbo Zishan interlining and the Shanghai Hongsheng Daohua products came out, resulting in rising market prices. This is what is meant by scarcity making things more expensive. Yesterday, the selling price of that black carbon increased sharply. A batch was sold at 1.45 yuan per yard, because the Teng Customs tariff moved to a weight-based tax, which amounts to about 6 jiao per yard, which made costs high, and the selling price was forced to become more expensive. Yesterday, Hongsheng black carbon sleeves sold for 1.35 yuan, and Jiangshan sold for 2.3 jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e250">Hardware: Hardware Prices Fall Across the Board <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>The hardware market has been unusually sluggish recently. The reason for this is the tight credit conditions. Purchases by foreign merchants have decreased, and many local factories have stopped operations. The market's turnover has therefore been sharply reduced, and the frequent arrivals of goods have caused fear. Only those in the industry with strong financial resources are trying their best to maintain the market, but unfortunately, prices are still falling gradually. Among all the hardware varieties, there is a loosening trend. The main varieties are recorded below:</p>
<p>Plain Galvanized Iron: Since Eastern goods flooded in, the market has been greatly affected. Although there is still some movement in the Yangtze River and other inland areas, most of it is scattered. The market sentiment is also affected by the loosening of foreign exchange, which makes it even more difficult to fill the gap. The current market price is estimated at 10.05 yuan per dan for No. 24, 11.5 yuan for No. 26, and 12.5 yuan for No. 28. American goods sell for 11.5 yuan per dan for No. 24, 12.5 yuan for No. 26, and 13.6 yuan for No. 28, a decrease of 2-3 jiao to 4-5 jiao compared to the previous price. It is said that only 100-200 bundles were traded in the market yesterday.</p>
<p>Galvanized Iron Sheet: The sales of this product made great progress in previous years, but now it is also going downhill due to the pressure of the poor environment. Although sellers are unwilling to loosen the market, prices are still tending to decline invisibly. The current market price is estimated at 11.25 yuan per dan for No. 24, 11.65 yuan for No. 26, and 12.55 yuan for No. 28, a decrease of 1-2 jiao to 3-4 jiao compared to the previous price. It is said that only 70-80 dan were offered in the market yesterday, which shows the decline of the market.</p>
<p>Hot-Rolled Steel: The market is weak due to the large supply, but practical can factories have stopped operations due to declining business, and sales have greatly declined. The market sentiment is also relatively soft. Old steel mills are estimated at 29 yuan, new steel mills at 18 yuan, unlicensed goods at 27 yuan, and Japanese goods at 16.75 yuan. It is said that only 100-200 boxes were traded in the market yesterday.</p>
<p>Bamboo Joint Silk: The market is overstocked. There is not much demand from the construction industry, and there are few customers buying. Recently, foreign firms have been selling their spot goods and stockpiled goods at the same time, dragging down the standards. The current market price is estimated at 97-98 yuan, while the single best style sells for only 94-95 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e252">Writing and Games <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— 稜磨</p>
<p>Recently, someone joked that most Chinese people generally recognize characters like one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten thousand, center, fortune, east, west, south, north, etc., probably without needing to be taught. This is indeed humorous, but it seems to evoke more than just a lighthearted feeling. It contains a rather serious question, and the seriousness of the question isn't just the worrying spread of gambling, but rather whether literacy education can be promoted using games.</p>
<p>Gambling and games are only separated by a fine line. Mahjong is gambling, while Chinese chess and military chess are games. Military chess uses relatively complex characters, so it's mostly popular in schools. Chinese chess is popular in general society, and there are even those who can play chess without being literate, which gives them the opportunity to recognize characters like general, minister, scholar, elephant, advisor, pawn, chariot, horse, cannon, etc. Old-fashioned playing cards sometimes used phrases like "superior man," "Kong Yiji," etc., to form sets. Although these have become purely gambling tools today, perhaps the original purpose of making these toys was specifically to provide children with spelling practice. In Guangdong, there's a kind of large dice with the surnames Chen, Li, Huang, Qu, Ma, Mai, etc., engraved on its six sides. I don't know what it's used for, but it seems convenient for people to remember the most common surnames. Besides newly made toys that utilize characters, there must be quite a few older ones as well. If someone collected them to investigate whether they can help promote literacy education, I think it would be a worthwhile endeavor.</p>
<p>Chinese characters seem to have an inherent flaw that makes them unsuitable for use in toys. The lack of newly made character-based game toys is probably also due to this. When I was in middle school, a word-chain game in English was very popular among classmates, from "Have" to "Ever" to "Read." However, middle school students' English was limited, so the game wasn't very satisfying. Therefore, we switched to using Chinese characters. English is based on individual words, so we also used individual characters for Chinese. The method was from "娘" (niáng, mother) to "郎" (láng, gentleman) to "防" (fáng, defend). It seems that Liangyou Pictorial once held this game, and I don't know the results, but Liangyou sought the result of how many words a person could spell on their own, while the school game was a game of multiple people connecting. Chinese characters are more difficult to connect than English words. Therefore, our rule for this game was changed to whoever writes a word that others can't connect loses. This rule greatly reduced the number of characters needed, but it also made us discover that all Chinese characters with left-right or top-bottom structures that are used in many places are very effective characters. Now that I think about it, this game can be used to create Chinese spelling cards, similar to English spelling cards.</p>
<p>If we don't avoid colloquial characters, many simple-shaped characters can be very effective. For example, the characters 口 (kǒu, mouth), 木 (mù, wood), 土 (tǔ, earth), and 又 (yòu, again) can be combined to form thirty-two characters if we maximize their top-bottom and left-right relationships. Among them, at least twenty characters are recognizable words: 吐 (tù, vomit), 嘆 (tàn, sigh), 呆 (dāi, foolish), 呂 (lǚ, surname), 扣 (kòu, knock), 杜 (dù, surname), 权 (quán, authority), 林 (lín, forest), 杏 (xìng, apricot), 麥 (mài, wheat), 埜 (yě, wild), 堆 (duī, pile), 栽 (zāi, plant), 吉 (jí, lucky), 圭 (guī, jade tablet), 雙 (shuāng, pair), 桑 (sāng, mulberry), 聖 (shèng, saint), 綴 (zhuì, sew). In this way, if we carefully select fifty of the most effective radicals, we can probably spell more than a thousand common characters. This is not only convenient for learning, but also for typesetting if this method is adopted, it will definitely reduce the number of lead characters needed. In order to make Chinese characters easier to learn, it is necessary to increase the effectiveness of already familiar shapes and gradually eliminate rare shapes. The large number of strokes is not the biggest difficulty in learning characters. Although the character 龍 (lóng, dragon) has many strokes, it is worth the effort to learn because it is also used in more than twenty other common characters. The character 㐙 (kǎn), except for 侃 (kǎn, upright), has no other use, so even though it is not complex, it is a waste of energy to recognize it.</p>
<p>There are also many Chinese characters that are inherently very effective but are not often used as components of other characters, such as 二 (èr, two), 三 (sān, three), 六 (liù, six), 七 (qī, seven), 年 (nián, year), 上 (shàng, above), 西 (xī, west), etc. There are also characters that are very effective as components of other characters but are not very useful on their own, such as 丙 (bǐng, third), 酉 (yǒu, tenth), 兌 (duì, exchange), 氏 (shì, clan), 佳 (jiā, good), 睘 (qióng, to gaze), etc. These two should really be harmonized to achieve the best of both worlds. The characters that can be learned from previous applications and character games mostly only have value for independent use, so they are less effective. Now, if we know how to pay attention to their value in the structure of general characters, then character games are still worth promoting. In general, people are not lacking in interest in characters. Jokes about writing the character 萬 (wàn, ten thousand), character riddles about guessing the character 極 (jí, extreme), and anecdotes about 造字 (zào zì, creating characters) being 造錯 (zào cuò, creating mistakes), as well as character twisting and character breaking games, are all very popular, or even games created by people who are barely literate. These all show us that people pay the most attention to the analysis of characters, and we should really make use of this interest. I believe that at least for characters made up of two components, we can use spelling games to increase the opportunity for practice. Although this is a simple idea, if it can inspire people to create valuable plans that incorporate literacy education into games, it would be a "stroke of luck."</p>
<h3 id="e253">Idle Sorrow <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Zhongtian</p>
<p>A pile of idle sorrow has been weighing on my heart like a stone for quite some time. In the past, when I was fighting the black hand of life all day long, idle sorrow was not allowed to exist in my heart. At that time, I only knew how to live, how to resist that black hand. But the current environment has changed a bit. This black hand of life is just hiding in a distant corner, not needing me to resist it. So, there is a lot of leisure time for me to reflect on the past and think about the future. In this situation, idle sorrow has taken root in my heart and is growing day by day.</p>
<p>I am not deliberately trying to be a moaner without illness; it is really that I feel I am too useless, and often see nothing but darkness before me. When I was young, my heart was full of hope, with my own small world of dreams. But as I get older, this hope gets smaller and smaller, and I think I am too insignificant. The kind of prayer that existed in my heart in my youth no longer exists.</p>
<p>A person's state of mind changes very easily. I have been very afraid of dusk lately. The color of dusk is like death. It seems that as soon as dusk descends, half of the world has died, and the stone in my heart also presses down especially hard. When a person reaches old age, it is like the day's journey has reached dusk. Dusk is a symbol of death for the elderly—regardless of how far away my age is from old age, seeing this symbol evokes feelings of disgust.</p>
<p>I have already seen the cherry blossoms, and my memories of them are not bad. I certainly sat under the cherry trees with friends, laughing and jumping, forgetting all the tears and sorrows of the world. However, this was only a fleeting moment. People love cherry blossoms, perhaps because they feel their lives are short and therefore love them? There are some things in the world that become more precious as their lives become shorter. This is a common feeling of mankind.</p>
<p>When old people see cherry blossoms, they recall everything from their youth—those dreams, those romances—and are probably filled with sighs, even if these sighs are not very strenuous. When young people see cherry blossoms, they think of the shortness of their own youth, and sing and dance to their hearts' content so as not to waste this youth...</p>
<p>Now it is the season when the cherry blossoms are withering again. When a gust of wind blows, you can see thousands and thousands of fallen petals floating in the air, floating on the ground, floating on your shoulders, and also floating in your heart. I cherish these petals like red maple leaves, clipping them in my diary. In the future, when I reopen this diary and see these petals, I wonder what my feelings will be?</p>
<p>Probably filled with sighs, right?</p>

<h3 id="e255">Miscellaneous Notes from Asahan (Continued) <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— Fei Er</p>
<p>"That never happened again." Mr. Lin replied, "Firstly, because the Chinese were prepared; secondly, because the colonial government knew that the Chinese had great economic power in this area. Fearing that the society's economy would be affected, they dared not let the natives run wild again. But the most important reason is that the natives, influenced by the propaganda of the National Party members, recognized that their enemy was the white race, not the yellow race. Due to this shift in perspective, given time, the Chinese people's fears might turn into cooperation with the Malays, right?"</p>
<p>"Good, then let's celebrate their victory!" I couldn't help but clap my hands and laugh.</p>
<p>Mr. Lin was also drawn to laugh by my laughter.</p>
<p>By this time, night had fallen. A burst of brilliant electric lights illuminated the streets of Asahan; the dust of the day settled down in the cool tropical night. The streets gradually swelled with crowds, and a stuffy atmosphere stirred in the air. My eyes, exposed to the light of the electric lamps, made my head, confined to the hut on the banks of the Kualu River, feel slightly dizzy.</p>
<p>"Let's go to the suburbs to catch some wind!" I said.</p>
<p>So we walked together to the iron bridge over the Asahan River, which reached the Sudan Railway on the opposite bank.</p>
<p>Under the long iron bridge, the waters of the Asahan River appeared completely dark in the night. Only in one or two places, reflected by the lights, did a few patches of white appear, reflecting the wrinkles of the river. On the iron bridge, many overseas Chinese who were cooling off leaned against the bridge railings, gazing at the dark sky, or talking in low voices. The buildings of the railway station on the opposite bank were far away, enveloped in large shadows, but on the faces of the overseas residents illuminated by the lights, I could see many hearts, haggard and melancholy, hidden behind smiles.</p>
<p>The night breeze often brushed over our white clothes, making my mind clearer.</p>
<p>Many ships were moored on the riverbank. On the dark heaps, many faint lights shone out from the ships. On the opposite bank of the river, a large area of equatorial forest enveloped the earth in extraordinary darkness. (The End)</p>
<h3 id="e256">Rainy Journey <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Ying</p>
<p>The rain was drizzling, and we parted ways.</p>
<p>This time, there were a total of eight people who came to Zhao Jiaji to issue loans: four guards from the security regiment, two bank accountants, Zhong Yu, and me. After the loans were issued, it started to rain lightly. According to the head of the Jia, we were supposed to stay in the market town for one night and leave in the morning, but the bank accountants wanted to return to the city to report, so we ordered the guards to escort the remaining funds and head to the city together.</p>
<p>Waving our hands, we parted ways. Zhong Yu and I rode our horses toward home.</p>
<p>The evening wind blew raindrops onto our faces, and our clothes slowly became damp. There hadn't been a sunny day for half a month, and the road was still muddy. We were traveling along a small path, which was a long embankment, with rivers and rice paddies on both sides. The sky was getting darker and darker every moment, and we didn't have lanterns, so we dared not gallop quickly.</p>
<p>There were few houses along the way, and we didn't encounter any pedestrians.</p>
<p>"Do you have weapons?" Zhong Yu asked from behind me, "I'm afraid..."</p>
<p>"What?" I turned around and asked, "Keep up..."</p>
<p>Listening carefully, there was indeed the sound of livestock footsteps behind us. Darkness covered the universe. Apart from the willow branches brushing our faces, the water waves turned dark and shiny, with a few boat lights. The rice paddies had lost their green color, and in the distance, it vaguely seemed like something was moving.</p>
<p>I comforted Zhong Yu, saying:</p>
<p>"Brother, how do you know it's not a traveling guest?"</p>
<p>"In the rain," Zhong Yu's voice trembled, "strangers wouldn't dare walk on the embankment."</p>
<p>While I was talking to embolden Zhong Yu, I was preparing. I held the hard weapons in my two riding breeches pockets. "Today, we are using the guise of issuing loans, and it is inevitable that we will be followed," I thought. I was a little anxious.</p>
<p>The distant hoofbeats were indeed following us. Slowly, we became aware that when we walked, he walked; when we stopped, he stopped. The two sides were always separated by a considerable distance. I was calculating that there were still two miles to the bottom of the embankment, and we could run when we reached the main road....</p>
<p>But, after walking another mile or so, I couldn't help but cry out in misery. The embankment was broken for about ten feet, and the villagers were drawing water. I desperately urged my horse to jump over it. The horse neighed loudly and shook its head, refusing to jump, so I desperately kicked its hind legs. I turned the horse's head and let Zhong Yu go over first. Zhong Yu's horse jumped over.</p>
<p>My horse still wouldn't jump.</p>
<p>The hoofbeats behind us grew closer and closer. And a strong light shot out from an electric baton, shining on us. The situation was critical. We were about to engage in close combat. I immediately took out the two boxes in my pockets and held them in my hands.</p>
<p>"Zhong Yu," I shouted, "fight them!"</p>
<p>My ready-to-fire posture was shrouded in the electric light for about a minute, and then the electric light disappeared. At this time, my horse naturally jumped over the ditch.</p>
<p>After passing the ditch, we listened quietly. The hoofbeats behind us did not follow, and no electric baton was shining on us either. I still dared not relax my grip on the two guns, remaining vigilant at all times.</p>
<p>Turning onto the main road, the rain stopped. Zhong Yu and I rode side by side.</p>
<p>"It seems he knows we have poor weapons and doesn't dare to chase us," Zhong Yu said. "He's still smart..." I smiled wryly in the darkness.</p>
<p>When we reached the village, I said to Zhong Yu:</p>
<p>"Lucky, lucky, there wasn't a single bullet in my two guns, if..."</p>
<p>We rejoiced that we hadn't encountered the "if." So, we could sleep peacefully again.</p>
<h3 id="e257">Rain (1) <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— He Wei</p>
<p>The rain was falling mournfully. As soon as it dawned, Tian Li pushed open the window. Seeing the intermittent spring rain and the gloomy sky, he felt a knot form in his heart.</p>
<p>His uncle, lying on the couch, was still sound asleep, snoring loudly. Tian Li looked at his flat, round nose, the nose hairs that vibrated with each snore, the toothless mouth that revealed half a row of yellow teeth, and the honest, reserved face, and felt a little apologetic for disturbing his uncle's sleep on such a rainy day for his own selfish reasons.</p>
<p>"Let him sleep a little longer," he thought with a little pity. But when he thought about how long it had been since he last saw Juanzi, and how he didn't know when they would meet again after this trip to the north, his mood changed again. He felt restless all over, hot and bothered, even though the weather was so cold.</p>
<p>Indeed, he had always loved Juanzi. Juanzi had undoubtedly not changed her heart either, remaining as passionate and pure as ever, he knew. They were originally relatives, because she was his aunt's daughter. But her father was a high-ranking military officer, and her grandfather had also been influential in the late Qing Dynasty. Tian Li's father was just a farmer who guarded his fields, and their family was really too humble. This meant that they could not only not marry, but even meeting each other casually had to be arranged by their uncle, because the old grandmother who was inseparable from Juanzi and had raised her since her mother died was the most snobbish person, and almost got a headache whenever she saw Tian Li. This made him extremely painful. He wanted to ask Juanzi clearly if he could see her this time, whether she had the courage to leave her family.</p>
<p>As he thought, he ran to shake his uncle awake.</p>
<p>"Hmm, hmm, hmm..."</p>
<p>"Why are you always humming, Uncle, it's not early anymore!"</p>
<p>His uncle, who had been vaguely answering from under the covers, sat up quickly when he heard these words that were half joke and half reproach.</p>
<p>"It's not very good with the rain..."</p>
<p>Seeing the gloomy weather, his uncle stammered again, hesitating. He sat on the edge of the bed wrapped in a quilt, his mouth puckered as if he was in a very difficult situation.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter, Uncle, you are always so suspicious. Can't Juanzi carry an umbrella on the road? Would her grandmother say that your house has a leaky roof and not allow her to go with you to stay at your house for a few days? No, be brave!"</p>
<p>Tian Li waited alone in a cool pavilion, while his uncle went to Juanzi's house alone. It was only a stone's throw away from her house, he could see it clearly, but he couldn't go. This made him gnash his teeth in hatred.</p>
<p>The pavilion was built in a narrow mountain gulch, not very high in altitude, but it could see far away. A stone mountain range wound around at his feet, disappearing into the barren fields at the foot of the mountain. Beyond the gray-purple grove of withered trees was the Zhijin River, where many small streams in the vicinity converged. Both sides were full of mountains, overlapping each other. Only the opposite side was a vast, barren plain—a gap.</p>

<h3 id="e258">"No Mission" and "Very Good Impression" <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>If you are preparing to become an important person in the future, or if you are already among the ranks of important people, you should at least learn two "terms":—"No mission" and "Very good impression."</p>
<p>For example, suppose you have been entrusted with an important task by someone, the provincial government, or the central government, and you are going to a certain place to negotiate. As soon as you set off, word spreads, and nosy reporters will come to visit you everywhere, asking about the purpose of your trip. At this time, even if you are usually an honest person, you have no choice but to lie and answer him, "No mission." No mission, then what are you doing on this trip? You can vaguely tell him, "Going there to have fun," "Visiting some relatives and friends," or you can simply say, "Going to recuperate," if you have no concerns. If the purpose of your trip has some clues, no matter how you hide it, you can only answer, "I am not carrying any formal mission on this trip, but I am just going to talk as a private individual." Because important people do important things, if you tell the truth, "secrets of heaven cannot be revealed," things will be messed up, and it might even affect the overall situation. Therefore, the "term" "No mission" is the best magic weapon for important people to deal with reporters.</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about "Very good impression," which is also a very smooth "term" that can be used everywhere. People who are important people sometimes cannot avoid going to various places to inspect, or being sent abroad to investigate something. The results of the inspection or investigation are reported to others. Naturally, it is the reporters who ask for news. When you return from your inspection or investigation, and several reporters surround you and ask, "Sir, what are your thoughts on this inspection (or investigation) to a certain place (or country)?" This question is truly vast and boundless. It is easy to answer, and it can be answered well, but it is also difficult to answer. At this time, you may feel that there are too many thoughts, and you can't say them all at once. Or you may feel that there are too many things to say, and you don't know where to start. Or because you have only seen a superficial view, you can't find anything good to say. Or even though you have inspected or investigated for a few days, months, or even years, you have not inspected or investigated anything at all. However, this doesn't matter. Don't worry and think that this question is very difficult to deal with. Here I tell you, the four words "Very good impression" can be your guarantee, rescuing you from the reporters' encirclement. "Very good impression"—isn't this the most beautiful answer? As for whether the result of your inspection or investigation is indeed a very good impression, and in what aspects the impression is good, you can ignore this. Anyway, the reporters have received your answer, and they have news to write. No one will delve into the bottom of things.</p>
<h3 id="e259">A GlimPSE OF HONG KONG <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Sizhong</p>
<p>The ship has passed the Seven Islands Sea. The moment we reach Chinese territorial waters, the homesickness of the travelers surges intensely:</p>
<p>"Oh, yellow motherland," your wanderer is about to fall into your embrace again!"</p>
<p>Seeing the deep blue of the Seven Islands Sea, I eagerly hope to reach Hong Kong quickly. Because once Hong Kong is reached, my gray hometown will be next.</p>
<p>Hong Kong has indeed arrived. First, a cluster of beautiful small islands, one after another, lined up in the sea. Green grass covers the land, making the mountain scenery as delicate as a young girl's face. Each hill is short and small. The ship passes by, making them look like children's toys. The seawater gradually fades from deep blue, eventually turning into light green. The ship travels in the vast ocean, seemingly without end. Once it enters the mountains of Hong Kong, it slows down, as if to allow the guests to enjoy the South China Sea's</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>mountain scenery, to ease the boredom of the four or five days of the hazy sea voyage.</p>
<p>Hong Kong appears to the traveler with its Westernized buildings. Although the territory has not yet gone beyond the British Empire's colony, seeing the Guangdong sampans filling the sea and hearing the noisy sounds of the Chinese citizens on the shore, one feels a sense of relief, because from now on, we are regaining the status of ordinary Chinese people, no longer like the people living in the colony.</p>
<p>The ship stopped in the waters of Hong Kong, and the friends traveling together suggested going to the mountain for fun. After four long days of drifting on the vast sea, how lovely the land feels to the sea travelers!</p>
<p>After inquiring about the departure time of the ship, everyone jumped onto a small electric boat that takes passengers up the mountain. When walking down the steep stairs, people repeatedly warned:</p>
<p>"The pickpocketing skills in Hong Kong are very high. Look, pay attention to those opium addicts with coats or raincoats rolled up on their arms! Watch out for your wallet. They think you are rich overseas Chinese returning home!"</p>
<p>I smiled and stepped into the small electric boat. With a whistle, the small electric boat started. The sea is full of ships of all sizes, and the boat women are rowing wooden oars, their sounds constantly spreading around.</p>
<p>Looking at the buildings layered on top of each other in front of me, it's very pleasing to the eye. It's a pity that it's not night, so I can't immediately see the beautiful and famous night view of Hong Kong. And with limited time, Hong Kong cannot be fully enjoyed.</p>
<p>The pier is very noisy. Everyone quickly grabbed a dim sum, walked through several large companies, and hired a car for a trip up the mountain. The streets in Hong Kong are very narrow and there are many pedestrians, so the car doesn't move smoothly. Once it leaves the suburbs and climbs on the deserted mountain roads, it becomes very fast. The various views of the sea, like scenes in a movie, are shown one after another. The houses, trees, bridges, and famous trams going up and down the mountain are also gradually reflected in the eyes. The city noise is very low from above, allowing us to fully appreciate the beautiful scenery. However, due to time constraints, we cannot make a more complete and thorough inspection of this important eastern colony, so we can only make a reservation first, and wait for a few days of free time to come and inspect this small island again.</p>
<p>Hastily, the sails on the sea and the small and exquisite villa-style buildings on the mountain flashed past the corner of my eye. Chinese citizens passed by the car in various postures, and the groups of rulers of the colony were sparsely left behind. We followed the ship's scheduled departure time and stepped out of Hong Kong's borders again.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the ship sailed eastward, and Hong Kong gradually shrank behind us until it disappeared. Therefore, I felt that these few hasty glimpses were not impressive enough, and I regretted not being able to see Hong Kong at night. Since then, I thought it would be easy to see the small island of Hong Kong again, but it has not yet been realized, which is truly filled with longing and yearning.</p>
<p>"When will I be able to see Hong Kong again?" I often ask myself this.</p>
<h3 id="e260">SILKWORM WOMAN <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Fei</p>
<p>On Qingming Day, the weather was mild and sunny. In the azure blue sky, except for a few wisps of milky white clouds drifting slowly, only a round sun was smiling down on the earth, its mouth wide open. The warm breeze brought intoxicating floral fragrances, blowing on Jinrong's sister-in-law, making her feel a little dazed. The mulberry trees in front of the door had already grown leaf lobes the size of foreign coins. Jinrong's sister-in-law was about to move all the silkworm rearing tools piled on the shelves down, carry them to the river to wash them clean, and then paste a layer of white paper on the bottom of the rearing trays, and carefully paste a red paper-cut of the Silkworm Flower Prince or Silkworm Flower Goddess, in preparation for receiving silkworm ants. Because Jinrong's sister-in-law was alone, she only raised two sheets of silkworm eggs. But even with just two sheets, if the silkworms grew well, it would be tiring enough for her alone.</p>
<p>In the days close to Grain Rain, she would always open the silkworm eggs tucked in her chest twice a day to see if they were developing evenly. When she saw dense, furry things wriggling on the seed paper, she skillfully and with experience took out the seed paper, put it in a small rearing tray, and placed it on a slightly warm wok on the stove to melt them. At the same time, she took a few dried winter mulberry leaves that she had picked last year, dried them over the fire, and ground them into powder. She also broke off a few cherry pits and some pomegranate buds to sprinkle on the seed surface. Later, she cut a few wild peach branches at the back door, and all the doors, including the main door, back door, and room door, were filled with them. She also put a branch in the small rearing tray for melting silkworm ants.</p>
<p>Finally, she ran to the mulberry field and picked a handful of tender leaves. After chopping them extremely fine on the leaf-chopping stool, she cautiously carried the small rearing tray and placed it on the table in front of the ancestral hall. Using a scale rod, she lifted the seed paper and gently wiped all the silkworm ants onto the small rearing tray with a large goose feather, then spread a layer of finely chopped mulberry leaves on the ant surface.</p>
<p>The silkworm rearing tray was placed inside the bed. She had to get up at least three times every night to spread leaves. The mulberry leaves were eaten down day by day, and the silkworm bodies grew larger day by day. From black, they turned gray, and then completely transformed from gray to white skin. At the same time, Jinrong's sister-in-law's work also became more intense.</p>
<p>For the first sleep, one small rearing tray became three medium rearing trays. For the second sleep, three medium rearing trays had turned into five large rearing trays. When it came to emerging from the fire - the third sleep - she was even busier. On the one hand, she was picking and cutting mulberry leaves, and on the other hand, she had to catch sleeping silkworms and get rid of silkworm droppings. Especially when she saw that it was about to rain, she had to rush to grab leaves at all costs. If it suddenly rained heavily one day, even under a torrential downpour, she had to cut leaves.</p>
<p>For the sake of the silkworms, she often didn't even have time to eat meals or have a fixed number of meals. She didn't even have fixed sleep, especially after catching the big sleep, she barely got four hours of good sleep a night. However, looking at those lively silkworms with mottled and white skin, they were indeed lovely. Listening to them eating leaves, the rustling sound was like heavy rain, and a unique, pungent fragrance filled the silkworm house.</p>
<p>First molting, second molting... Although she had encountered several heavy rains in between, she was fortunate to have prepared enough overnight leaves in advance, so no major panic occurred. However, during the night of the big sleep, a heavy thunderstorm kept her company at the silkworm table all night without closing her eyes.</p>
<p>A month passed quickly, the silkworms were old, and Jinrong's sister-in-law was thin.</p>
<p>Now, in the living room and wing rooms, everything had turned into clusters of snow-white, adorable cocoon mountains. She was extremely happy. Although it was the result of more than a month of hard work and effort, having so many snow-white cocoons could at least comfort her.</p>

<h3 id="e262">BEIJING PEOPLE'S "TEA DRINKING" <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— Yueshan</p>
<p>"Tea drinking" is very common in our country. Regardless of north or south, regardless of elegance or vulgarity, everyone likes tea. Beijing people's "tea drinking" is very famous. Apart from the refined scholars and elegant gentlemen, even peddlers and commoners often make "tea drinking" a habit. What I want to talk about is this type of people's tea drinking. I haven't tasted the taste of the elegant people's tea tasting, so I won't talk about it.</p>
<p>In Beijing, tea houses are as numerous as sesame cake shops and sliced noodle shops. No matter on the main streets or small alleys, sesame cake shops can be seen everywhere. In Beijing mornings, the calls of sesame cake vendors can be heard at any time on every alley. The number of sesame cake shops is visible, and the number of tea houses is the same. One of the reasons is that sesame cake shops often turn into tea houses in the afternoon.</p>
<p>There are also tea houses that do not belong to sesame cake shops, because sesame cake shops are busy making sesame cakes in the morning and do not have the time to sell tea. For those who want to drink morning tea, many tea houses have become professional, not making sesame cakes.</p>
<p>Anyone who has been to Beijing has probably seen such signs: a rope tied to a piece of mahogany board, with cloth strips tied under the board. The board is written with words such as "Before the Rain," "Tip of the Tongue," "Fragrant Flakes," etc. That is the tea house. Some tea houses also hang many paper balls, with paper strips hanging from the paper balls, like an umbrella: That is the sesame cake shop (or sliced noodle shop, those paper strips represent the meaning of noodles.) that also serves as a tea house.</p>
<p>This is the appearance of Beijing tea houses, which is slightly different from those in Nanjing, Suzhou, Guangzhou, etc.</p>
<p>The patrons of this type of tea house, apart from a small portion of idle people carrying birdcages, are mostly laborers. They are not going to "taste tea." They are there to recover from fatigue, to make their bodies and minds feel refreshed. At a very low price, they gather a few close friends, talk, laugh,</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>laugh, and sometimes maybe scold a little. It is their entertainment.</p>
<p>Sometimes this phenomenon can be seen: two rickshaw pullers, both sweating, are pulling their respective customers. When they face each other, one says: "Hey, see you at Eryouxuan tonight." The other echoes: "Definitely, I'll wait for you." Then each goes his own way. That is pulling a close friend to drink tea. Tea houses are not lonely places. Strangers quickly become friends. Even if they have never met before, face to face, teapot to teapot, I pour you a cup, you pour me a cup, and then they start talking, talking about life, talking about social news. Sometimes they also scold, this donation and that donation are all on the list of things being scolded... Their conversations. seems to have no distance at all. How is the weather, what is your honorable surname, these are rarely mentioned. They are all sincere, all bold, and they can talk about anything. After they finish, they each go their own way, like close acquaintances, but in reality, they haven't even exchanged names. The nature of Northerners can be seen from here.</p>
<p>This way of drinking tea is not expensive. The tea leaves can be brought by oneself, and a large piece of "Gaomo" (i.e., leaf ends) can be drunk for half a day, while the water fee is only three or four cents per person, which can be said to be extremely proletarian. As for storytelling places and summer tea sheds, they are relatively expensive. This type of tea drinking probably costs no less than about ten cents. The most expensive is of course the tea seats in the park, which usually cost ten cents per person. If you invite two or three friends and crack one or two plates of melon seeds, it is already about one yuan. This should belong to the "tea tasting" category, which will not be discussed here.</p>

<p>"The Beginning of Man" filmed a street scene yesterday. Although there were only seven or eight shots, there were more than 500 actors. Shi Dongyou and Zhou Kezhen were sweating profusely.</p>
<p>Next door to Yihua Company is Jiangnan College. Recently, Jiangnan College moved, and the Chinese Women's Sports Teachers College moved in. Yesterday morning, Hu Ping went to the company because she had a scene in "The Beginning of Man." When she passed the school, she was seen by more than 20 girls standing at the school gate. After a burst of "Look at Hu Ping" shouts, they all surrounded Hu Ping in the center. At this time, the embarrassing expression on Hu Ping's face was truly profound.</p>
<p>Yue Feng's new script has been completed and will soon be sent to Beijing for inspection. The female lead has been chosen to be Ye Juanjuan, who received good reviews in "The Flight." Ye Juanjuan has been particularly diligent in practicing "Mandarin" these days.</p>
<p>Newcomer Zhang Fei plays the role of a boat girl in "The Beginning of Man." Although it is her first time on camera, she performs quite naturally.</p>
<p>Miss Ge Aina, a graduate of Tsinghua School in Beijing, has officially joined Yihua. She has a role in "The Storm," which is another clear demonstration of Yihua's promotion of newcomers.</p>
<p>Yuan Meiyun plays Wei Heling's daughter-in-law in "The Beginning of Man," but she plays Wei Heling's daughter in "The Storm."</p>
<p>Fang Peilin, the set designer for "The Beginning of Man" and "The Storm," has recovered from his toothache, and his specialty, "Ventriloquism," is also performed as usual.</p>
<p>Chen Linshu, the stage manager of Yihua, is getting fatter day by day, and is on the verge of catching up with Yin Cenxiu.</p>
<p>Yan Chuntang, the general manager of Yihua, is proficient in Tai Chi. Anyone who asks for instruction is granted without exception.</p>
<h3 id="e267">"NATIONAL CUSTOMS" GRAND OPENING <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>Since Ms. Ruan Lingyu's last work, "National Customs," opened at the Jincheng Grand Theater, it has been a week in the blink of an eye. In terms of box office, it has always been crowded. Ruan Lingyu's past works have never disappointed people. This last work is even more noteworthy, not to mention that the cast of this film, in addition to Ruan Lingyu, also includes Lin Chuchu, Li Lili, Zheng Junli, Luo Peng, Liu Jiqun and other big stars. The red flowers and green leaves complement each other, and the directing skills of Luo Mingyou and Zhu Shilin are also very lively and agile. A very serious subject is written with extremely fancy techniques, giving people a feeling of both crying and laughing everywhere.</p>
