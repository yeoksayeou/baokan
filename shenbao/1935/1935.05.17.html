<h3 id="c17">奧國擴軍與中歐問題之新展開 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>— 紀</p>
<p>歐洲各國。自德國三月十六日公然宣言重整軍備以來。幾無日不在秣馬厲兵之備戰狀態中。英法二國已實行擴軍。意相墨索里尼。乘茲歐局多事之秋。更大展其向外發展之雄圖。意奧匈三國亦有積極完成其軍事集團之企圖。當四月十一日英法意三國於斯特萊柴會議開幕之際。意相曾昂然以中歐之盟主自居。爲奧匈提出擴充軍備之要求。及至最近。法蘇互助協定旣吿成立。而德波間軍事密約之傳說。又甚囂塵上。歐洲軍事集團之分野。漸已形成互相對立之形勢矣。</p>
<p>今據路透社消息。奧國以意國之支持。悍然不顧巴爾幹及小協約諸國之意旨。實行其建立空軍之計劃。組織特別內衛飛行團。以副總理史泰亨堡爲總司令。此種不恤破壞聖日耳曼條之約舉動。顯爲步德後塵。予凡爾賽體系以嚴重之打擊。</p>
<p>考中歐問題。自去年奧國維也納政變以來。雖以意法之協力支持而暫吿小康。但其潛在之危機。則始終未獲消除。蓋德國對於德奧合併之企圖。仍圖進行。而奧國哈布斯堡皇室復辟之醞釀。復得實力派相當之支持。其目的雖以國際關係之阻梗。均未實現。然其希望固未嘗拋棄也。迨後德國旣公然宣言擴軍。奧國愛國陣綫之份子。卽頓形活躍。而廢除聖日耳曼條約之呼暇。當時卽已遍於國內。意相鑒於形勢之嚴重。故有本月四日意奧匈三國羅馬會議之召集。意在鞏固意奧匈三國之結合。决定其應付未來多瑙河會議之具體方策。而爲其對法對德外交之張本。但會議結果。成效未著。而匈國已表示其携貳之態度。此由匈國感於所處之地位。易受德國之攻撃。未敢公然參加反德集團之故。至於小協約及巴爾幹諸國。則一聞奧國擴軍决議之消息。卽深惶慮。故其對於意國之關係。有隔閡之傾向。於是巴爾幹公約簽字國（卽羅馬尼亞·南斯拉夫·希臘·土爾其四國）於本月十日在羅京舉行四國會議。共商應付國際環境之對策。今據官方報告。會議中所討論者。爲（一）地中海公約計劃。（二）巴爾幹協商各國與意大利及蘇聯之相互關係。（三）協商各國間之相互經濟關係。同時並與小協約諸國。進行密切合作。法國前外長彭古。亦參與會議。五人苟一究其會議之眞相。可知彭古之所以參加。實含有兩種作用。（一）法國欲以調人之地位。緩和巴爾幹。小協約諸國與意奧之衝突。（二）法國欲運用外交。增進法意協定成立後之意法關係。而此兩種作用。其目的皆在對付德國然奧國。今巳實行擴充軍備。局勢頗有變動。小協約及巴爾幹諸國與意國之關係。能否保持和平親蕃之局。目下巳無把握。假使意國與巴爾幹。小協約諸國之關係。因局勢之變動。而日趨隔閡。則行將召集之多瑙河九國會議。勢難順利進行。如是。則法國亦將因已往努力之徒勞。對於中歐問題遭逢其新生之難關。凡此皆奧國實行軍擴計劃後可能之影響。注意歐洲問題者所不可不察者也。</p>

<p>（莫斯科）法俄談話業於今晚結束、當經法國外長賴伐爾與蘇聯外委李維諾夫發表共同公報、內容略謂、「兩國代表主張繼續進行談判、俾聯結以前曾經考慮之各國、根據互不侵犯·相互諮詢·及不援助侵略國之三項約束、訂立東歐區域公約、史丹林·摩洛多夫·與賴伐爾·一致主張組織集體安全、以求達到維持和平之目的、並因法俄互助公約、業在兩國之間產生一種信仰之精神皆引以爲幸」、公報又稱、兩國負有責任、不應使其國防方法稍見脆弱、法國所採國防政策、目的係在維持陸軍軍力、以達保障安全之標準、此項政策、史丹林深予了解、完全加以贊同」、法俄兩國代表茲又聲明、對於和平建設工作、力加扶持、此項工作當由全體關係國家以自由誠信之精神、通力合作、始能求其完全實現、任何國家若願合作、法俄兩國决不予以拒絕也云云、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（莫斯科）由法俄兩國共同發表之公報觀之、法俄兩國已商定將繼續由外交途徑舉行談判、以使德國·波蘭·蘇聯三國、共同訂結東歐區域公約、規定三國間互不侵略·相互諮詢·及不援助侵略國家之義務、按法俄前訂結互助公約、本無包圍德國之意、且曾邀請德國參加、今法俄公報中又有訂結東歐區域公約之提議、則德國當更可釋然於懷矣、此次德國倘願參加東歐互不侵犯公約、則歐洲集體安全、因此種組織而增强、德國自亦同被其利也、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3 id="c186">各國文學底相互影響 <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— 王集叢</p>
<p>在文學底發展過程中，特別是近代文學中，我們可以常常看到各國文學底相互影響的事情。這是什麽道理呢？我們以爲一種文學之發生或被移植於某一社會中，乃是由於那一社會之一定的需要所使然的；如果甲乙兩國底文學在某些地方發生了相互的影響，那也是在它們底某些相同或類似的社會需要下發生的。但在甲乙兩國間之會有類似的社會需要存在，也有其實際的根據；這根據便是在於它們底社會關係有某種類似；一定要有這種頭似的社會關係，才能發生類似的需要，因而在文學上也才能發生相互的影響。所調國民文學底相互影響，並不是無條件，無根據地發生的。佐治，曾經說過：「一國文學給與他國文學之影響，是以兩國社會關係頭似爲正比例，全然沒有這類似，是完全不會發生影響的。」事實上，歐洲人雖早已到了非洲，但非洲黑人至今還未受到歐洲文學的影響，在川甘靑康交界處的　落克地方的遊牧人種，雖爲我們所早知，但直到現在這些遊牧人尚未收到我們文學的影響，什麽羅曼主義，寫寶主義，新寫寶主義……等名詞，對於他們底遊牧生活可謂毫無意義；……這些事實，都充分說明了如果沒有類似的社會關係，兩個國家，兩種人類，即使是已經通往來了，那在文學上也是不會發生相互影響的事情的。</p>
<p>在十八世紀之末和十九世紀之初的五六十年間，羅曼主義的文學思潮風靡於全歐了。一般說來，這種文學思潮是先盛行於英吉利，隨着才在德法開了繁盛之花的。但在全部羅曼主義的運動中—英德法三國實是發生了相互的影響。法國底羅曼主義的狂流雖然發生在英德之後，但盧梭（Ronsseau）底「回到自然」的主張—却是早就給與了整個羅曼主義運動放下了一塊理論的基石；雨果（Hugo）底「歐那尼」之上演底成功，不僅是表現了法國羅曼主義之戰敗古典主義，而且是表現了羅曼主義在歐羅巴之勝利，其影響是遍及於全歐的；同樣，德國底歌德（Goethe）及德国底所谓「狂飈运动」，對於當時英法底文學也是有着很大影響的。由此我們可以說在偉大的羅曼主義狂流中，英德法底文學實是相互影響的。此種相互影響之發生，不消說也是由於英德法三國底社會關係之類似。首先，在十八世紀後半，英國已漸漸走上工業資本主義社會了，隨着德法也脫變成了這樣的社會形態的國家。這個工業資本社會底主人新與市民，爲了洗滌，那建設自己底文學的道路，便不能不破壞已有的文學的規律，否定古典主義。於是在先後走上了工業資本社會的道路的英德法三國中，便先後發生了羅曼主義的文學思潮。但是，因爲新興的工業市民在當時還　幼稚，還沒有完全支配那新社會的能力，在文學上更還沒有充分的經騐和修養，以致不能將其獨立的社會意識在文學上鮮明地表現出來；而那時的貴族又是已經沒落下去了的，當然也沒有積極的向上意識，在文學上更是不能表現出他底支配精神了；所以，這時出現的羅曼主義，無論是在英德法，都是表現出貴族的與混雜的兩種姿態的。這便是當時英德法底社會關係有着很多的類似的明證。由於這個類似英德法底文學在當時才發生了相互的影響，在它們底社會中才發生了羅曼主義的狂流。雖然，在當時英德法出現的羅曼主義，也各有不同之點，但一般說來，總是相類似的；這種類似底實際根源，當然是存在於其類似的社會關係中的。</p>
<p>如果把問題移到中國，那便更明白了。大家知道，自一八四〇年帝國主義用大砲轟開了繁開着的中國底門戶以後，特別是在「五四」新文化運動以後，中國文學之受西歐文學的影響已成爲了無法否認的事實：易卜生（Ibsen）底個人主義，在「五四」時代的中國曾得到了很大的讚揚；羅曼主義與自然主義的文學潮流，也曾在「九四」以後的中國交流着；隨後什麽新寫實主義，新羅曼主義的思潮也被運到了中國。僅僅幾十年的時間，落後的中國幾乎是把在歐洲經過了幾世紀的文學現象都搬運過來了。於是，那些國粹主義者，便大感不安，以爲中國文學之跟着外國文學跑，完全十幾個愛好「洋貨」愛好新奇的文人製造出來的；爲了要保存國粹，他們便拚命反對了中國文學接受外國文學的影響的事情。其實中國文學之受西歐乃至日本文學的影響，並不是少數愛好「洋貨」愛好新奇者憑空造出來的，而是由於中國社會關係與西歐乃至日本的有許多類似使然的。一定要中國有了市民底存在，西歐和日本底市民文學才會傳到中國來：否則即使西洋人日本人走進了中國內地，共市民文學也是不會被中國接受的。單以「五四」的文學革命來說吧，有不少的文學研究者都以爲這個革命全是在外國文學的影響之下發生的；其中就是那些比較進步的也是把外國文學的影響當做　個文學革命之發生的主要原因之一的。不錯，「五四」文學革命的確受到了外國文學的很大的影響，但這影響並不是革命發生的根本原因；反之，倒是因爲中國底社會發展到了「五四」時代，已經有了爆發那樣的文學革命之必要與可能，在這個必要與可能上，在那樣的文學革命第需要上，西歐文學才在那是給與了中國文學以強烈的影響。更具體地說，就是那時的中國社會關係與西歐的社會關係已經有了類似之點，在中國社會底內在的需要下，西歐文學在那時才影響了中國文學，才發生了「五四」文學革命。如果沒有這個類似，那西歐文學對中國文學比就不會憑此給與若大的影響的，因而其與中國文學革命也是不會發生什麽關係的。周作人先生在其「中國新文學的源流」中對於西歐文學影響於「五四」文學革命的問題曾做了一個巧妙的解說：「萬事齊備，只欠東風」；接着他又說這兒的「東風」應該改作「西風」。這就是說「五四」文學革命之發生，是由於中國社會已經具備了發生這個革命的條件，所以也才跟西歐社會跑去，接受其文學思潮，爆發了文學革命。所謂西歐文學在那時之影響中國文學的事情，並不是「五四」文學革命發生的根本原因，只不過是那革命的一種外的推動力；而且，這一推動力是由於中國社會之內在的需要，由於那時的中國社會關係與西歐的有着某種類似所招引來的。</p>
<p>那麼，「五四」時代的中國文學爲何沒有給西歐文學已影響，只是受著西歐文學的影響呢？我們底回答是：中國社會與文化都比西歐的落后，近代社會及其文化在中國發生最晚，中國社會所產生的一切文學現象實在沒有值得先進的西歐諸國攝取的；反之先進的西歐諸國已有的文學倒爲落後的中國所急需；因此，在「五四」時代的中國社會關係與西歐的雖然有些類似，但事實上却只有中國文學跟著西歐文學跑，只有中國文學受到了西歐文學的影響，而中國文學却未影響到西歐文學。</p>
<p>由於上面的實際的考察，可見各國文學底相互影響問題，乃是在類似的社會關係下發生的；同時，在兩個社會關係有些類似的國家間，如果有一個是較爲落後另一個則是較爲先進的，那麽，其文學的影響便是單方面的：即較爲先進者影響那較爲落後者。目前中國有不少的人常常憤　的說：中國文學只是跟着日本跑，而日本文學又只是跟着西歐各國跑，這是要不得的！殊不知這種情形也有其實際的社會根源，不管你高不高興，只要這實際的社會根源存在，那由之所產生的那種文學現象，總是會存在而且要發展的。</p>
<h3 id="c187">奧諾勒守蒲拉克的滅形（一） <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— 法國Ｇ.Apollinaire作　蕭林譯</p>
<p>警察們對於奧諾勒·守蒲拉克的減形雖經過非常精密的偵查，但關於這事件的不可思議的眞相，終究不能確知，便那麽敷衍過去了。</p>
<p>奧諾勒·守蒲拉克是我的朋友，再加我又很知道這事件的顚末，所以我便認爲向當局報告這件事的眞相，爲自己應盡的義務。但當法官聽完了我的申述之後，他竟惴惴然以出乎其類的溫柔的語調向我問起話來。因此，我便曉得這位法官竟把我當做狂人看待了。我把這事向法管說破。但這樣一來，他却格外溫柔了起來了。而且過不了多久，他突然站起身來，　地裹把我向門口那邊推去，連剛纔在抄錄我的口述的書記，也隨之傲然而起，緊握着兩拳，好像我倘若發起狂來，便會出其不意的撲過來的樣子，擺着這樣聲勢汹汹的身勢。</p>
<p>這以上，我便不再硬說什麽了。要之，奧諾勒·守蒲拉克的減形必竟是太奇異的一件事情，結果反使其眞相類乎毫無根據的虛構之事了。守蒲拉克本來是一位怪人物，這是一如他的減形當時的新聞記事上所報道着一樣。他不拘什麽時候，無冬夏之別，都赤身裸體僅披上一件僧衣，且在一樣赤裸着的腳上，拖著一變拖靴。這在曉得他非常富有資財的我，覺得這事情的不可思議，也曾問過他爲什麽裝着這樣不雅相在外面行走的。當時的他的回答是這樣的：</p>
<p>—這是預備在必要時能迅速變成裸體的緣故罷了。至於穿薄衣出外，對於人的身體是很容易練慣的。廢除　衣褲及　子與帽子，一點沒有靴處。我從二十五歲起一向過着這樣生活，甚至沒有病過一次。</p>
<p>可是他這些話，不僅不能絲毫解釋我的疑問，反而把我的好奇心刺　起來了。</p>
<p>—這到底是什麽意思呢？奧諾勒·守蒲拉克爲什麽有迅速脫衣回成裸體之必要呢？</p>
<p>我不得不這樣想。</p>
<p>一天深夜，我向自己家中回去時——約在下午半夜一點鐘或一點一刻罷——所聽見有人低聲呌我的名字；而那聲音好像是從我擦身走過的牆壁中傳出來的。我喫了一驚，不知不覺立住了。聲音便接著說道：</p>
<p>—街路上看不見人影嗎？是我，奧諾勒·守普拉克啦。</p>
<p>我睜眼回頭四面，但在那裡，找不見我那朋友的影子。</p>
<p>—到底是在那裡呀？我說。</p>
<p>這時，我在行人道上看見了那件見慣了的僧衣和那雙拖鞋。</p>
<p>—這必定　因什麽必要而使奧諾勒·守普拉克迅速脫衣的塲合了吧。這次我必須把握他的秘密的錀鍵了。我這樣想着，便放聲呌道：</p>
<p>—街路上沒有人了。朋友，出來罷。</p>
<p>奧諾勒·守普拉克突然從剛才我什麽也看不見的墻中赤裸着身子出現，　時間說起那件僧衣從頭頂上套下來，趕快把　子扣好，再拖上那雙拖鞋。像下了决心的　　，能與我一直向前我家門口走去；與我並肩血行，邊走邊說。</p>

<p>— 仃</p>
<p>自從出家了以後的珍，時間只不過短短的兩年而已。然而一切的突變那麼的迅速呵。</p>
<p>在前年，當珍還在省立高中讀書的時候，她不是一個滿茁壯，活潑，美麗，能韓的女子嗎？</p>
<p>在那時，珍不但好說話，喜看書，肯做事，並且還喜歡運動哩。</p>
<p>對於人生真是樂觀的。所以關於未來的一切，她是那麼的抱著一種劇烈的追求和崇高的理想。多麼可愛與光榮的珍呵</p>
<p>記得——那是當我們行將離別的一天晚上，珍站在學生會的講壇中央，曾經嚴厲的堅决的警惕的又似乎臨別贈言一般地對我們說過這樣的話：「我們算是畢業了。此後大家聚首談心，一起工作的機會就很少了。所以，在這時，趁著我們還沒有分散的時候，我想衷心地和各位同學談談。我覺得：此後我們的任務更加堅重哩。出了校門，踏進了社會，一切的都不像在校裏那樣的了。我們要明瞭，中國——特別是我們婦女，在目前是處於一個如何可怕的境地呵。我們所過的好像是非人的生活似的。一切的都使我們痛心，憤恨！所以，作爲新時代女性的我們，應該負荷起偉大的使命來！對於包　着我們週遭的惡劣底環境奮鬥。我們不能像一般「摩登」女子那樣：只會陶醉于桃色底生活之中和那種可　的專門　成迎合男性心理的卑劣行動裏面。我們應該拿出新世紀的精神來——自尊，獨立，向前，奮鬥的—這樣，來着我們一貫的宗旨幹去。至少，在我們千千萬萬婦女同胞當中，去領導她們，喚醒她們，爲着我們悲慘的命運打開一條前途的緣故！這算是我對於諸位同學最後一次的會話了。將來倘有機會的時候我很希望大家能夠互相督率，勤勉，互助，並且常常指教我！」</p>
<p>可是，只離別了短短兩年的光陰呵，珍的變化是那麼地突然和迅速呵。</p>
<p>此　珍終日只是呆呆地　在冷靜的家裏，街不去，事不做，書不看，甚至連話也懶得說。整天的不是打盹，便打牌。不是打牌，就悄悄地一個子癡呆地坐在朝南的窗口下，夢幻似的眺望着那碧綠的蒼空和皎潔的月兒。心是憂鬱的，仿佛秋天的季節那樣。</p>
<p>「這種日子怎樣消沉的過去哩！」她喃喃地說着。於是深深地虛了口氣，重新眺望着窗外去，碧綠的天空滿怖着閃耀着星火，大地仍舊趟在死寂的月光里。而在這死寂的月光里底依稀的茅舍之陰影，以及冷落的悲凄的咳嗽聲，使得珍更加苦惱起來。這時在她的腦里湧激着一種熱灼的，苦難的，仿佛被太陽蒸發過了的石頭那般的思想。面對於這思想，珍不會用一種適當的契合的明晰的字句去說明它。</p>
<p>「唉，算了罷。你瞧，你瞧！」珍獨自喃喃着「這月亮多美麗，高潔，可愛與光輝呵。」於是在珍的面龐上，湧現着一種艱難的喜悅。而這喜悅，倘你仔細地去尋味它裏面的成份時，你便發覺那是多麼苦澀的一種喜悅呵。</p>
<p>或許，可以說：這聲音是從珍的生命力逆發出來的一種熱情。這聲音，也許是從珍悠久地沉溺於苦惱的生活之中而體騐到自然之美和愛的一種領悟。總之，此刻珍已經變了，一切都變了，意識上與體魄上。</p>
<p>以往，那種高尚，傲岸，光榮的特質都從珍的生命上悄悄地溜過去了。</p>
<p>現在珍是那麼的孤獨悒鬱，痴人似的呆呆地獃在陰暗的房子里，對於孤獨的天空，凝視着那孤獨的夏月，惟有在這樣青蒼底夜里，珍才感覺到孤獨者的心是如何的憂鬱呵。</p>
<p>「人生多乏味哩！」於是一種傷感的淚水，滴滴的潤濕了她的衣襟。「唉，我眞懊悔離開學校呵！我爲什麽不再去升進大學呢？我爲什麽會嫁給這樣的一個醜惡的老頭兒哩？難道我是瘋狂了嗎？難道我已經喪失了所有的一點理智不成嗎？唉，爲什麽呀？金錢？名譽？享樂？這是怎樣一種可詛咒的事情呵！這個衰弱的貪婪的老人不是常常被我厭惡的一種人物嗎？他不是憑藉着那種雄厚的財勢來引誘，壓迫，玩弄，蹂躪我們女性的傢伙嗎？咦，咦！我怎樣會嫁給他哩！…」带着譴責的口氣，珍那麽憤憤地責問着自己。</p>
<p>然而一切的似乎都無可挽救了。珍自從父親經管失敗之後，因爲家庭經濟的拮据，就沒有繼續升學的可能了。從那時起，珍的生活上雖然經過了不少的變化。但最後，終於給父親的嚴厲的威脅及母親苦苦地懇求之下，珍莫名其妙的答應了，屈服了。嫁給她一個曾經被珍以往引證作攻擊點的人物，專靠着祖宗的遺產過着墮落生活的紈袴子弟。</p>
<p>可是——「那是多麽奇怪的呀？」珍說「難道我的眼睛也瞎了不成？這明白是個醜惡的大腹賈！唉，我受騙了，我受愚弄了。一切的——完啦！我……我是犧牲在崇拜金錢和榮譽的社會制度之下呵……」</p>
<p>珍於是痙攀地飲泣着。</p>
<p>只挨過了像這樣的兩年的淒慘的生活之後，珍仿佛一個垂死的人一般的，或是一雙破鞋似的被摔倒什麽角落去了。</p>
<p>她從冰冷的人間里她獲得了一種悔心的蔑視，從虛僞的酬　中她感到了一種心碎的創痛，從傲岸者的中間她領受到了一種難堪的白眼，從過去的同學當中她慚愧着自己生命的可恥！從那老人的身上她　到了一種資本家的腥臭的野　底氣味。</p>
<p>「不能！不能！我絕對的不能這樣的混下去呵，」珍終於這樣不自　的喊出來了。</p>

<p>— 淸癯</p>
<p>豆一名「寒豆，」因爲這種植物，原來是草本，而偏偏兩年生，（科學上分一年生，與兩年生，或多年生，）如今歲下了種，（大約在八九月中，）須到明年養蠶的時候，方能成熟；你想不是經過了兩個年頭麼？所以從他豆的名時講，旣經挨過了嚴冬的冷天，而能不至凍死，故呌他爲「寒豆；」他開的花朶，又像似小小蝴蝶般飛舞枝榦上，在春風動盪裏，顯著紫黑色的美麗，悅人心目，但到結成了果，呌他是「豆莢；」長約三寸許，顔色是綠的，當中襯著一重雪白的像絮狀差不多，而有三四粒豆，又像是蠶寶寶安睡在裏面；半老時候，豆上胚的前面，還露出一灣黑綫來，眞極像是「蛾眉；」故呌他「蠶豆，」實在是不錯啊！</p>
<p>「蠶豆，」照吾邑所產的，有兩種，一種呌「綠寒，」一種呌「白寒，」倘若在嫩的時侯吃起來，自然要算「白寒」了；因爲「白寒，其肉來得細軟，著鍋就熟，而皮亦較薄，且沒有澀味，所以格外可口；像「綠寒，」性質堅硬，如至乾老時，或炒，或作豆沙，那　　沒有什麼分別，在眼前蔬食品裏，總讓「白寒」爲第一，「蠶豆」上市，要算廣東最早，浙江次之，上海菜館中吃著的，在陰曆二月間，大半是廣東貨，稍後，是浙江貨，地氣愈暖，出產亦早，像嘉定地方現在剛剛上市，要算最晚了；而且「白寒，」佔地不過近城的各鄉有之，倘離城五六里以外，田畝裏的「寒豆，」統通變了「綠寒，」這也是很奇怪的；大約不是種性的變遷，和土宜的關係，沒有別的原因吧！</p>

<p>— 張慕良</p>
<p>租界上公共汽車的路綫，當推十路爲最長。自滬西曹家渡起至滬東引翔港爲止，這兩個往來的地方，都是工業區域；經過的路途，約有三十里之長。</p>
<p>這裏很少可以看到闊老和貴族派妖媚的女人們。所能看到的，不是九流三敎的人，便是勞工階級們；由於這個綠故，根本談不到什麽秩序和衛生了。人聲的鼎沸，香烟的繚繞，眞會使人不能忍耐而要作嘔起來！</p>
<p>但這裏有罕聞的趣事，新穎的笑話，……源源不絕，正是一個笑話的發祥地。</p>
<p>賣票似乎認識那個江北媽媽說：『快點！快點！你常常牽絲攀籐的，買票終要還價；吾們賣票又不是賣　　靑菜。』</p>
<p>『唷！先生！退班兩個銅板小意思，爲什麽要嘩喇嘩喇？』</p>
<p>『辣你的媽媽—你自己少了銅板，還要怪人家嘩喇嘩喇？』賣票也操着江北音說。</p>
<p>那個江北媽媽，聽了賣票的話早已動怒了，於是來勢汹汹的對正賣票便是一記耳光說：『要錢好話的，爲什麽要罵人？打你這皮匠子的磚牌子！賣票豈肯示弱，况且給伊吃了兩記耳光，更是火上加汕，他沒有聽完江北媽媽的話，也老實不客氣大打江北媽媽，因此大家不管三七二十一的打得秩序大亂起來；當時幸虧有幾位和事老出來打圓塲，他們都不約而同的說着：『好了！好了！大家不要多吵了……』</p>
<p>這個風浪方才平息，那知又一個風浪來了。一個鄉曲似的模樣，本來坐在後一排車角裏打睡的，聽說小沙渡路到了，就急急忙忙的走出來，羅宋查票員要向他看票子，他買十一分，羅宋查票員也似乎認識他。於是操著純粹的華語說：『你從引翔港到此地，只有買十一分？』</p>
<p>『羅宋先生！我打了睡，忘記下來了，謝謝你讓我下去吧！』</p>
<p>『你交關壞來些，常常想揩油；阿拉上次小沙渡路碰着你，假打睡媽媽虎虎，今天假打睡不可以，票子也不罰你，請你到曹家渡下去……』</p>
<p>這個羅松査票的眼光眞不差，同時他罰票的方法也是別出心裁；呌假打睡的朋友到曹家渡下去，這位朋友當然再要回到小沙渡路的，那麼從曹家渡到小沙渡的車資不是等於罰票嗎？一笑。</p>
<p>總而言之，十路公共汽車上的笑話很多，有些是說不出來能使人相信的。</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>有時候，太后會在這御犬廐中逗留得很久：除掉照例讓那些哈叭狗向伊表演一回以外，伊還得隨意指定一條狗，施行檢騐。當然伊老人家是决不肯蹲下去俯就它們的，總得由那管狗的太監把伊所指定的那條狗捧起來，舉在伊的面前，讓伊細細的察看：察看之後，伊少不得總要說：「它的眼睛太髒了，你們都不管事嗎？以後非得好好留心不可！」或者說：「這條狗的後腿太長了，或太短了，不合適中的尺寸！」或者又說：「這條狗的身子太長了，太難看了！」無論那一條狗經伊下了上面這兩種評語以後，—尤其是初生的小狗—便等於奉了流徙的旨意，不能再容它在宮內安居了，必須立卽放逐出去。因爲後腿太長或太短，以及身子太長，都是無從校正的毛病，只得請它們出去了。可是那些管狗的太監爲免除麻煩起見，往往把這種奉旨放逐的狗就動手殺了，好在太后也不會査究的；但逢到被放逐的是小狗時，他們便不肯輕易殺却了。他們會悄悄地抱出宮去，賣給相熟的人家，代價是往往很可觀的，因爲人家知道是宮中抱出來的狗，不免特別希罕些，多出幾個錢也是願意的。</p>
<p>這一天，我們原是爲着要看那「黑寶玉」所生的四頭小犬而來的；因此那管狗的太監忙着把它們盛在一個竹筐裏呈上來。（三一六）</p>

<p>— 瓊聲</p>
<p>不知是有了蕭伯納出生於英國的關係呢，或者還是英國產生了蕭伯納的關係，總之從這一國度裏出來的紳士們，談話均極其幽默，令人解頤。前年蕭翁以觀光團的資格遊歷遠東，新聞記者在北平東京等處均曾以遠東形勢相問，此老的答復是這兒談話不方便，那兒發表言論不自由，這種態度當然已經十分蘊含幽默。可是在倫敦的議會上，英國紳士們講話總不會再感到「不方便」「不自由」，儘可直言不諱了，然而他們仍是發揮特有的天性—幽默。</p>
<p>去年英國下院議員，曾質問日本不許各國駐軍在榆關一帶演習，有違條約，英國是否表示抗議，西門答復說，榆關不演習不怎樣要緊，關內許多地方正可演習。一時會塲為之絕倒。讚為「幽默」。最近因為傳聞輸入之中國雞蛋，含有徵菌成分，下院特別注意，加以討論，又發生一次「幽默」的故事。</p>
<p>十三日倫效路透電稱：「沙士比代表衛生部大臣，謂近來所研究者，為中國雞蛋之徵菌成分，渠聞雞蛋脫離冰凍時，並未發生腐化。韓倫謂中國雞蛋係在可使人嗯心狀况下產生，應卽禁止其輸入。工黨議員勞生則稱，中國雞之生活程度，實較美國雞為低，此言引起鬨堂大笑。」云云。</p>
<p>在列强各國紳士淑女們的眼中，中國之「可使人噁心狀態」的事物正多，日本人之談到中國的「南京蟲」，西歐博物館內之陳列「三寸金蓮」，美洲人之言中國人吃蛇，凡此一切就是他們對於中國人的印象。非僅如此，在「文明人」間時常這樣說，支那民族是同豬玀一樣在汚穢泥潭中過活，同老鼠一樣的繁殖。紐約的「唐人街」，東京的「支那人區」，每一談到，就皺眉蹙額，「使人噁心」，因之我們可以這樣聯想，現在各國的限制和排擠華僑，莫非中國人亦同中國雞蛋一樣，因其使人嗯心，便「禁其輸入」麽？</p>
<p>如果是這樣，我們也可依照勞生的話「幽默」的說一句：「中國人的生活程度，實較美國人為低」。不過中國人的生活為甚麽較美國人為低呢？這不是明明自白的列强侵略的結果麽？然而各國的紳士淑女們是懂幽默的，所以不能這樣說出「不幽默」的下文。</p>

<p>三五支昏黃的燈火是僅有的光亮，照耀着用狹長的木板隔成，緊窄得僅够容身，的鋪位，有如陳列在橱窗裏各色的貨物，用木板分隔着。</p>
<p>從艙穴頭向外張望，陰沉的雲迷濛的天，同奔騰的波浪，就像一無邊際的，無限單純的濃墨的畫片，使人抖顫。</p>
<p>艙裏頭，靑灰色的混濁的塵霧昇騰着，織成一個濃重得駭人的幔。雜貨樣的瘦小的生物在這幔裏喘息着。</p>
<p>海航底第二天，近晚，船在一個埠頭泊下了。</p>
<p>人一個個由幔底爬出，在甲板上搖幌着散步。兩天來險惡的航程，給每人畫上一副相同的臉色：蒼白，死灰，頭各自低垂在胸前，兩腳異常地軟弱無力，眼簾紅腫得突出着。</p>
<p>雨不知道在什麼時候停了，海風變得滋潤而溫和周身感受到濕味的凉快。在成塊的濃重的雲低壓下，黑黝黝的波浪微微地起伏。遠處，天接述着水茫芥芥的一片，連綿的山聳峙，就像大海底屏幛。夜底黑影沉下來了。</p>
<p>人們也恢復了固有的矜持。頭等艙底莊嚴的紳士們輕聲地調侃着，問或飄下來一絲女人底淸脆的朗笑。笑聲撩動了幔底裏的人物，雜亂的鄉談，和者善意的咒駡閒始了。</p>
<p>嫵媚的樂音從艙頂傳來。竚立在甲板上迎頭望，就輝煌的燈火下，高貴的男女們各自佔有着一席坐位，咀嚼着東西，對對地起舞</p>
<p>「卽使在最難於順應自然的地方，就像海航，人與人也隔離得遠遠的呢』……近似這類迷糊的戚覺，下意識地昇華起來，帶着過度的疲勞與憎厭的心，各人重復攢進令人窒息的幔，蜷伏在本板的一角，於是記起了被遺忘的顛沛的家世，飽經滄桑的靜止的心波，便掀起或種流浪人底苦澀的韻味。</p>
<p>船身輕微地側動，濕味的海風從艙穴吹進來，也帶進嫵媚的樂音，水聲嘩啦嘩啦地響。難堪的心之岑寂拘起各種思緒。</p>

<p>— 羅伽</p>
<p>我知道，海是痛苦的。當牠捲起一陣雪白的浪花，又捲一陣雪白的浪花底時候，牠是輕拍著赭黃色的岸壁，而訴語著難堪的悲愁。</p>
<p>（是哪！海是痛苦的，在那揮動著彩色紙帶手帕帽子的碼頭畔，剛駛出了遠涉重洋的維多利亞號，而沾有了巴黎底香粉的康脫魯梭號，却復悠悠地進來了！這些龐大的怪物里，是載著千萬噸別離的憂怨的哪！那千萬行思念遠人的苦酸淚，便輕輕地留入了海底心中，使海是永遠地傷感著！傷感著！牠底哀歌，便沒有一個時間會休止的呢！）</p>
<p>而我還知道，海是辛勞的。當海上的夜霧，遮攔住夜月底淸輝，灑向一燈營營的漁舟上去的時候，海上是顯出十分悲凉。於是，海是疲倦地太息了，聲音是凄惻鳴咽！</p>
<p>（是哪！海是辛勞的。海是一個最偉大的體力勞働者，終日終夜地流動著自己底血液，養育了無數的生命—那些捕漁人，製鹽人。他們在海底巨量生產下，生活著。於是，海是太辛勞了！牠是沒有閒暇，未揮一下汗，流一點眼淚的。雖然，牠也曾疲倦得太息了！）</p>
<p>我——一個辜負了海底種愛的孩子。</p>
<p>然而只有我是了解海的，因為我是海底兒子。我底軀體，受過海底撫育：我底心靈，受邊海底　陶。所以我愛海，眞如我愛我底母親一樣。</p>
<p>我是生長在海邊的漁村里的，我熟諳了海底牠欬，海底呼吸，以及牠底痛苦，牠底辛勞，我常常為馨祝福著</p>
<p>把頭髮結成兩個髻角兒的時候。（那時候我是只曉得糖底甜味，而不愛鹽底鹹苦的哩！）我常常把一天底時間，化在海灘上去。懂得折幾枝野花草，揷在剛經海水吻過的柔沙上，和我底幾個小友，舉行鄭重的野祭。懂得等候潮水退去時，在柔軟的海灘上，檢拾美麗的貝殼。兩雙手縱然已經滿握，但是，貝殼所給予我們底印象是太誘人了！逼使我取下了頭上所戴的大草帽，盛得滿滿地帶回家去。我常常把我最心愛的幾顆貝殼，贈給我底小妹妹；因為我底小妹妹是一位貝殼收藏家。或是我們也會斯文地坐在海邊的岩石上，懂得凝望著浮沉於海浪間的漁卅。看白羽水鳥，從我們的頭上掠過，飛入海中去。留心著天際的紫雲白雲，變幻成一棵樹，一園春花，一條神龍，一頭赤馬。</p>
<p>這樣地，我是在海底光輝里長大了　　我相信，我在我底母親底懷里的時問，是少於在海灘上的日子的哪！海是我底母親，我底保姆！</p>
<p>可是，我是辜負了海底鍾愛的。牠賦予我以海濱居民所特有的氣質，而我却不能一一地使用。甚之，為了適應我底環境，我是委曲求全的將牠藏進心底秘室里去了！</p>
<p>還在訴語著難堪的憂怨嗎？還在疲倦地太息嗎？我底偉大的母親，我對於你底懷戀是太苦太重了！縱使是在夢里。</p>

<p>— 挺宜</p>
<p>紅底金字的海報滿街飛着，是琴姑娘在鴻興茶樓登臺的第一天。鴻興茶樓的老闆是個有面子的人物，他每天提着鳥籠從家裏到茶樓來的時候，有的向他點頭，有的呌着老闆，他老是隨意含首，把另一個手中的一對胡桃磨得嘩啦嘩啦價嚮。但是他對付那些茶客們，是用另外一付態度了。因為鴻興茶樓雖然他是被呌做老闆，但是掏出腰包，來組織這俱樂部式的茶樓的是本邑的紳商巨縉。彷彿衣食父母般的那些爺們，老闆自然得運用他的手腕了。琴姑娘在鴻興茶樓上演，就是老闆應那些爺們的策略之一。</p>
<p>太陽沒有落山，鴻興茶樓前的彩牌樓先本邑的各大商店亮起「琴姑娘」三個大字的電炬來，老闆親自在門前招待，他的胖臉堆着一條條的肉痕，眼睛自然更顯得小樣了，然而那個不可掩飾的大肚子却高高地挺在紡綢衫的外面。他得意地笑着，一對胡桃應和着他心腔底跳躍。</p>
<p>樓上，四壁懸着各位爺們贈給琴姑娘的綢幛，包括各種「天仙化人」，「淸歌妙舞」的贊頌詞。沿牆添設了籐靠椅，這是專為本樓的實際老闆的；中央的方桌，才是出售外客。但是現在在樓梯旁也排起坐位來了，老闆額上掛着粗大的汗珠，從這位爺們面前轉到那位爺們面前，時或低低地說着話，於是每個人的臉上都是笑意盎然了。</p>
<p>臺上一塊匾額上的電炬也亮起來了，那些本邑坐第一把交椅的胡老爺特贈琴姑娘的。上面是一首詩，專程從上海湘繡莊定裂的，為了這隆重的禮物，老闆陪琴姑娘昨夜上胡公館去面謝的。</p>
<p>塲面鬧了起來，整個鴻興樓上被聲音騷擾着，無數對的眼珠逼射在繡簾上，一陣熱烈的掌聲中琴姑娘從簾後飄然出來了。她把目光向四周掃去，用絹巾掩着嘴角故意裝了個微笑，那些爺們的手掌不由地打了起來。</p>
<p>胡琴第二次拉過了過門，琴姑娘唱了，是，四郎探母」，胡老爺昨晚親自點的。</p>
<p>那個呌胡老爺的就坐在臺角的牆側，他是第一個接受琴姑娘的眼風的。現在他滿意地微微盍着眼，用右手的食指，中指，無名指敲着籐椅的手靠，架在左膝上的那條腿同時自然地蕩洩着。到每句曳長的尾聲，他馬上合起手掌來，然而被更大的掌聲掩過了他的盛意。</p>
<p>琴姑娘唱完後，接起金茶壺來潤潤喉老闆又是一截矮冬瓜似的滾到胡老爺面前，謙卑地請胡老爺點戲，胡老爺偷下向各人巡視一週，維持自己的尊嚴起見，微笑着拒絕了。於是一個手摺輪到第二位爺們手裏，第三位，第四位……大家溫雅地笑着表示拒絕。這時候一個響大的聲音從人叢中飛了出來：</p>
<p>「來一個武家坂！」</p>
<p>誰都沒有餘閑去探究這個聲音的來源，胡老爺第一個擊着掌，自然一連串的掌聲嚮響着。</p>
<p>琴姑娘照例目光向四壁掃去，用自己的脚尖打着拍子唱起武家坂來。到第二段她特別賣力，唱過了薛平貴，逼着假嗓子唱王寳川，手掌又是像轟雷似的把她送　了繡簾。</p>
<p>觀衆却不肯立卽動身，目光都向臺後射去，他們的什麽一部份被琴姑娘的秋波攝了去。老闆就打躬灣腰，請各位爺們明天早些來。</p>
<p>客人陸續散去了老闆一頭燕子似的掠到後臺，在卸裝的琴姑娘的耳畔輕輕地說了句：「胡老爺請你去。」同時向對鎭中做了個難看的媚眼。</p>
<h3 id="c211">元叔 <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— 李晴</p>
<p>早晨，六點半鐘，大家已經吃完了朝飯聚集在天井裏採桑葉。蠶已經大眠開葉，再等三四天便要上簇做繭子了。然而就在這歲天，食量却非常宏大，桑葉大堆大堆的鋪上去，立卽有一種沙沙的聲音發出，像驟雨一般，聽上去十分淸晰而頻繁。</p>
<p>為了桑葉的消費快，所以，採桑葉的人都在緊張地工作著。</p>
<p>尤其是早晨，等露水乾了之後的第一批，剪得格外多。天井裏堆得高高的，，滿滿的，小孩成人都在動手；這熱鬧情形，在今年倒還是第一次哩。</p>
<p>一邊工作，一邊談着閒天，作為疲勞的抵制，這是體力勞働者們慣用的策略。所以，元叔的牛又吹開啦。</p>
<p>先是阿坤弟提起了種瓜，元叔便神神飽滿地說：</p>
<p>——這幾年，種瓜積人也少了。嘿，阿坤，你們沒有看見哩，前個七八年陳家莊面前的西瓜多大！多旺，我和阿四兩個，一晚上總要弄到一兩担呢！</p>
<p>元嬸嬸便接上來說：　　——偸瓜算啥個好事體？虧你還說得　響！</p>
<p>但元叔却全不在意，依舊在滔滔地講下去，並且阿坤阿毛也都接上來矜誇自己偷瓜的本領。他們以為；「偸瓜勿算賊。」</p>
<p>不多時候，長脚阿三從街上捉了小猪回來了。他給人們帶來了一個不祥的消息：</p>
<p>——今年的爾子又是沒有道理的，兩家繭行都想開，不過聽說看高只有二十塊洋錢一祖，鄉下人眞是死路一條！</p>
<p>許多人的面部都蒙上了憂慮，只有元叔那樣顢頇的人還在起勁地說：</p>
<p>——現在眞不能和從前比！前幾年</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>，前個八九年，阿毛，你總沒有看見！繭行裏擠到密勿通風，人都軋勿進一個，不要說哼了繭子了！有許多沙洲人，都是天沒亮就來的，想費掉？槓，談何容易？人家那裏會放你軋進去，比你力氣大的還多啦。而且本地人只幫本地人，那裏會幫你沙洲人？啊，看看眞罪過啦，他們等到太陽落山追不曾賣掉，餓得肚子呌，沒有銅錢買點心吃，只好匍伏在橋上像娘娘們一樣哭！哭，哭煞也沒有人來理睬呵！</p>
<p>大家還沒有表示意見，元叔又亟兩地接着說：</p>
<p>——從前繭子也貴，七十八十洋錢一擔，有好處，自然養蠶的人也多了。說句老實話，那時候賣繭子，在村上只有我和小培兩個，軋進去，軋出來。自家賣掉了替別人賣，啥人凶？一拳頭！還手？哼，談也勿要談！除非他繭子勿想賣銅錢！……</p>
<p>元叔還想說下去，元嬸嬸却耐不住了。她駡：</p>
<p>——少吹點牛罷，我看你眞是勿要面孔的咧！</p>
<p>但是其餘的人却不響，只各人用各人不同的姿式微笑着；他們曉得元叔的力氣大，話是不會假的。但是這誇耀的光榮史，畢竟是過去了近！年來，那種蹙况簡直就不曾有過。—也許永遠不會再有了吧？</p>
<h3 id="c212">茶坊小景 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 秦鑒</p>
<p>春天過盡的季候，天氣漸漸地在暖起來：雲有了烏烏沈沈的濃厚的姿態，樹葉有了深綠的盛年的豐滿，溪邊有了不斷煩曉着的刮的蛙聲的深夜的夢裏有了紅色的蓮花，而生活在這暖流中的人，便也有了一種煩燥的心情。</p>
<p>「去找尋外面的世界去吧！」有的人也許會懷了那種心情上茶坊去泡壺茶凉着，搖搖扇子，架起腿看各式人的暄鬧，來消磨一個初夏的午間的：但如果說上茶坊去的全是患着消化不良症，或吃得太飽而想藉以按摩過飽後的神經的，那也不能說是十二分眞實的話，在茶坊裏——卽使是一個設在「老虎灶」旁邊的村輪上的小茶館，人是常常聚在那裏，喧鬧着，爭辯着，談論着，慨嘆着一些可怕的，不快意的生活上的大小問題，為了日子的不好過而引起的煩燥與意氣的相爭，為了一兩個銀角子而引起的拳觸；在那兒，暴燥，憂急，忿憤，嘆息，……的心武混雜起來，正像無數不同型的臉相與不同調的語音之混雜一樣。</p>
<p>從大孩子的時代起，為了找尋埋在世界的盡頭的生活，好遠地打家裏飄出來，已經是有着無數的年月了。小的時候是常常在鎭上的小茶坊裏看到外鄉的「吉潑賽」人的流浪味的；次重新拾起孩子時代的記憶，走到茶坊裏，熟悉地用四個銅子換根籌，找個安逸點的位子坐下來的時候，茶坊已經不是從前的那個了。</p>
<p>屋子裏是暗黑的，烏黝黝地透進來三五　天光。幾張壞爛的方桌子橫雜地放着，人雜亂地坐在條櫈上，雜亂地說話，雜亂地爭吵。大堂的角落裏依舊放着那方唱雜要的破木台，可是已經沒有人在唱，也沒有人再有優閉的心思去聽了。人，帶看不同臉相，可是却有着同一枯瘦的形容，頭上流着汗，嘴裏發出不同的聲音，用蒼白的眼睛看給烟火熏黑了的牆與天花板，而心頭却儘在打轉：籌劃而企圖；怎樣可以談成一二件小買賣回去量米，怎樣向人開口借那麽三五塊銀洋買豈餅，怎樣拖住了年府借了一塊三四角「印子」的傢伙用粗猛的聲音與力氣來逼討。賣相的打着「善觀氣色」的招子各處跑、用　攬的笑與刻板的江湖訣招呼人；可是人在長久的顛沛中生活了來，也已經學到對命運的懷疑了。縱然有人十分想知道那接着來的　難到什麽時候才會有個盡頭，可是因為記得搭褳袋的幾個銅子還得活一天，便又一聲不響地垂下頭，聽周圍人的嘈雜，相駡，爭吵與打架了。</p>
<p>誰再能說茶坊裏有着可愛的熱鬧與喧嚷呢——這該是過去的夢了。現在茶坊是依舊存在在小村子裏，可是在那兒展開着的，祇有生活的肉搏與不快意了呢。</p>
<p>說：茶坊是軟味的吧，但這是過去的事情了啊。</p>

<p>唐納，他有豐富的電影知識，而且是最努力的電影批評家］在做演員的條件上，他也是異常具備的一個，健康的體格，英俊的姿態，配上他豐富的學養，和專長演技的導演的帮助，這必將使他在其他許多成就之外，更開拓一個燦爛的明星前途，這大概是他的文字的愛讀者們歡喜知道的一個好消息。</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) Long Yun telegraphed on the 14th that the Yunnan bandits had completely crossed the river to flee into Sichuan on the 10th. In addition to the 21st Column and the Hunan Army led by General Commander Xue crossing the river in pursuit, our army was ordered to build forts along the river to prevent them from disturbing us again. (Special Dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Long Yun telegraphed the Yunnan Fellow Provincial Association in Beiping on the 14th, stating roughly that the Communist bandits this time fled to Yunnan, specifically choosing remote places to escape and avoid our sharp edge. A portion feigned an attack on the provincial capital, while the majority fled to Wuding and Yuanmou, attempting to cross the river into Sichuan. He immediately ordered the pursuing troops to hasten the encirclement and suppression. After the bandits arrived in Yuanmou, knowing that the main force was pursuing them and their ambition would not be fulfilled, they abandoned their original route and turned towards Luquan, lying in wait during the day and traveling at night, secretly crossing the river. Fortunately, the local officials of the counties they passed through were still able to resist as much as possible, and important counties were not harmed. Currently, the bandits have crossed the river. In addition to the 13th Columns and the Hunan Army led by General Commander Xue crossing the river to advance and attack, the Yunnan provincial army has built bunkers and defenses along the river to block their return. (Central News Agency Dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) A portion of Zhu and Mao's remnant bandits attacked Huili. The Central Army has successively crossed the river to pursue and suppress them. According to reports, our army killed many bandits near Huili and has made contact with the garrison troops in the city. (Central News Agency Dispatch on the 16th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Peng Bizhen, captain of the 54th team of the Changlu Tax Police stationed in Dingxing, led mounted and foot tax police to search for saltpeter in various villages in Shili River on the 12th, searching house by house, setting fire to and destroying civilian houses, and injuring a Wu surname woman. The township head and deputy were furious and gathered hundreds of villagers to surround the tax police and engage in armed fighting. The county government received a report, dispatched personnel leading a large contingent of troops to forcefully mediate, confiscating the firearms of the tax police, temporarily calming the conflict. On the 13th, hundreds of villagers braved the rain to petition the county government, demanding that the tax police withdraw from the territory. (Special Dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<h3 id="e7">Britain and the United States Will Both Elevate the Status of Their Embassies in China; Elevation of Sino-Japanese Envoys to be Announced Today <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The elevation of the Sino-Japanese envoys was originally scheduled to be announced simultaneously in the two capitals at 10:00 AM on the 16th. Later, due to a temporary notification from the Japanese side stating that procedures still required approval from the Emperor on the morning of the 17th, the announcement was rescheduled for 5:00 PM on the 17th, to be announced simultaneously by both parties. The content of our country's announcement on the 17th is simple, describing the process of confirming the elevation and appointing Jiang Zuobin as the first ambassador to Japan. In addition, the spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will express his thoughts and hopes regarding the elevation event. After the elevation, the organization and funding of our embassy in Japan have not been fully determined, but it is roughly based on the model of the embassy in Soviet Russia. After the elevation, the increase in the number of our consulates in Japan is only under planning and has not yet been decided. (Special Dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The elevation of the Sino-Japanese envoys has been fully decided after negotiations between the two countries. Both parties have also agreed to mutually elevate the incumbent ministers to ambassadors. The original agreement was to announce it simultaneously on the 16th, but because the ceremony for Ambassador Arimiyoshi's inauguration could only be held on the 16th, the Japanese side specifically telegraphed our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to request a one-day postponement. Therefore, it was agreed to reschedule the announcement to 5:00 PM on the 17th, to be announced simultaneously in Nanjing and Tokyo. As for the announcement documents this time, it is understood that in addition to the official announcement of the elevation of the envoys of the two countries, the diplomatic authorities will also make a statement on the process of this elevation. The official decree appointing Jiang Zuobin, our first ambassador to Japan, is expected to be issued by the National Government on the 17th. (Central News Agency Dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese Embassy Counselor Shimizu told reporters on the 16th that the rumors that he was going to Beijing to arrange for the relocation of the embassy to the south were inaccurate. The Japanese Embassy does not intend to relocate to the south, but the Shanghai office has decided to move to Beijing, and the address will be within the Japanese Consulate General in Beijing. Currently, the Japanese ambassador is stationed in Shanghai on a regular basis, but in the future, he will be stationed in Beijing on a regular basis. Regarding the elevation of the Sino-Japanese envoys and the appointment of the first ambassador, it is rumored that it has been announced, but the embassy has not yet received a public announcement from the Japanese side. Isoya will definitely not come north because he is a major general and military attache who must accompany the ambassador. (Central News Agency Dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The exchange of ambassadors between China and Japan was originally scheduled to be announced simultaneously in Tokyo and Nanjing at 10:00 AM on the 16th.

<p>(Tokyo) According to reliable Japanese sources, both Britain and the United States have decided to elevate the status of their embassies in China. It is heard that London and Washington will make a formal announcement tomorrow. When Japan previously notified Britain and the United States about the elevation of the Japanese Legation in China, it suggested to Britain and the United States that they might as well do the same.

It is also heard that the counselor of the British Embassy, Dodd, notified Japanese Vice Minister Shigemitsu yesterday about the elevation of the Chinese Legation in Britain.

(Reuters Dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The United States Ambassador to Japan, Grew, visited Foreign Minister Hirota at the Foreign Ministry at noon today and said that he had received a telegram from U.S. President Roosevelt stating that the U.S. government had also decided to elevate the legation in China to an embassy, ​​and specially conveyed this notification.

Moreover, the British government, after being persuaded by Foreign Minister Hirota to implement the elevation, notified yesterday that it would elevate at the same time as Japan. The United States also followed suit, so the elevation of the legations of Britain, the United States, and Japan in China will be announced simultaneously in Nanjing, Tokyo, London, and Washington. Also, when Japan makes the announcement, it will immediately appoint Envoy Arimiyoshi as Ambassador. The appointment of the British and American sides may be delayed for some time. (Dentsu News Agency Dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the policy of elevating the legations in China, Foreign Minister Hirota previously notified various related countries, including Britain, the United States, France, and Italy, and simultaneously urged those countries to elevate their legations in China. Britain then decided to follow Japan and decided to elevate. On the 15th, it expressed its intention to Foreign Minister Hirota. The timing of Britain's elevation will be announced at the same time as the announcement by China and Japan on the 17th. Moreover, the United States, upon receiving the news of the decision of Britain and Japan to elevate, also decided to elevate, as if preparations have begun for confrontation. However, there may be some delays in the procedures. (Dentsu Dispatch on the 16th)</p>

<p>(Jinan) The Zichuan coal mine tunnel was blown open with explosives at 10:00 PM last night. There was no one inside. The water surged up immediately. Four water pumps with a total of 150 horsepower were used to pump water, but not only did the water not decrease, but it increased by 40 sheng every six minutes. As of 5:00 PM today, the eighth level was full of water, and the water was still rising along the shaft. Because the eighth level is connected to the Shilizhuang mine, the water is heading towards that mine, and work must also be suspended from the 17th. The Zichuan coal mine, which has been mining for more than 30 years, with a capital of tens of millions and a daily output of 2,500 tons of coal, has no hope of mining from now on. More than 800 workers have no hope of survival. The direct unemployment of workers is about 3,000, and together with their families, there are more than 10,000 people who have no way to live. Japanese engineer Rokuo went to console the family of Japanese engineer Aihara, who drowned today, and was almost strangled to death by his wife. (Special Dispatch on the 16th)</p>

Nishida, the Japanese consul stationed in Jinan, personally went to the mine yesterday to inspect it and met with Commander Gu Shiliangmin.

<p>(Nanjing) The ninth National Transportation Conference convened by the Ministry of Railways held its opening ceremony at 10:00 AM on the 16th in the auditorium of the Ministry of Railways. Zeng Zhongming, the vice minister of railways, and other senior officials Gu Zhengding and Sa Fujun, as well as 23 attending representatives Xiao Weiguo and Jin Shixuan, and 72 observers Zou Zhiquan, etc., attended. Zeng Zhongming chaired the meeting. After performing the ceremony, he delivered a training speech, stating roughly that the eighth Transportation Conference was held in 1931. For four years since then, the conference has not been convened. After years of destruction, the various railway transportations have been reorganized and repaired by this department. Just in terms of business, such as the implementation of responsible transportation, water-land intermodal transport, various traffic openings, and connecting timetables, the results have been roughly achieved, which is also the result of the efforts of the personnel of the various railways. The central objectives of this conference are: (1) to seek commercialization and rationalization of transportation; (2) to increase transportation capacity; (3) to unify the regulations of various railways; (4) various issues should be based on the interests of the national railways as the standard; (5) to establish a freight rate policy. He hoped that everyone would express their opinions and jointly seek a satisfactory solution. After the training speech, Yu Yan reported on the business achievements of the past two years and the process of preparing for the meeting. The meeting was adjourned. In the afternoon, a general meeting was held to discuss the review methods. It was decided to divide the six types of proposals of the general meeting into three groups for review, and the list of groups was also decided.

<h3 id="e14">Wu Zhongxin Talks About Guizhou Province's Governance Plan <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Guiyang. After the provincial government was taken over, the reporter, seeing that all parties hoped for governance, specially visited Chairman Wu at the provincial government on the 15th to ask about his observations after arriving in Guizhou and his future governance plan. The following is a record of his conversation: (1) Social observation: I (Chairman Wu refers to himself below) have not been in Guizhou for long, and I have not fully understood the social situation. However, based on general observation, I deeply feel that the people are honest and simple in their lives, and they are quite able to meet the conditions of the rural economy. However, production is mainly based on opium, which violates economic principles. In the future, it must be replaced with beneficial production to seek rational construction. (2) Taking over the provincial government: It was quite difficult to take over the provincial government, because in fact, everything was starting from scratch. There was really no so-called takeover. Although this situation is rare, it cannot be blamed that the past provincial government was too poor. Now, the provincial government and various departments have been organized and are in order. Most of the staff have been selected from the original ones and employed based on their merits. The situation has been good since the start of work. (3) Joint office operations: Joint office operations by various departments of the provincial government are indeed a good way to improve administrative efficiency. However, it is not easy to find a suitable location in Guiyang City for the time being, so it can only be handled as before. (4) Financial situation: Everyone knows that the province's finances are exhausted. Since Director Li took over, he has cut redundant institutions to save public funds, and at the same time, he has tried to eliminate embezzlement. After this thorough reorganization, income can naturally increase. The budgets of the various departments of the provincial government have now been prepared, but they have not yet been reviewed in a meeting. The income and expenditure are roughly sufficient to offset each other. In the expenditure section, business expenses account for one-third, especially construction expenses and education expenses, which have increased significantly compared to before. The recurring expenses of the various agencies follow the central government's regulations and use the lowest amount of provincial government expenses as the standard, seeking to manage the province's affairs with the province's financial resources. The lives of civil servants cannot but be thrifty. (5) County magistrates: County magistrates are officials who are close to the people, implement the orders of higher authorities, and relieve the suffering of the people. The county magistrates are relied upon. Therefore, the selection of county magistrates should be strict. The Department of Civil Affairs is currently formulating specific employment measures. The performance of the current county magistrates, whether good or bad, is also being strictly assessed. Those with excellent performance will definitely not be changed lightly. (6) Education of the Miao people: The Miao people in this province are all physically strong and have strong production capacity. There are many things that require the joint efforts of the Miao people to develop Guizhou in the future. Therefore, the culture of the Miao people should not be neglected. However, the customs and habits of the Miao people are mostly different from those of the Han people. Large-scale organization and training will inevitably cause resistance or misunderstandings. It is now planned to open a Miao people training class in the near future, selecting outstanding young people from various Miao tribes and training them to govern the Miao tribes in the future, which can achieve twice the result with half the effort. (7) 編警備團: The Provincial Government Security Office can be established soon. It is now planned to organize two security regiments directly under the office. This plan has been roughly decided and can be realized immediately. There are many plans to be carried out at present, but I usually admire the ancient sages' teaching that governance should not be verbose. Everything should be implemented step by step and steadily. Especially in Guizhou, where the people are poor and the finances are exhausted, even if there are good plans and good ideas, they may not be able to be implemented immediately. Only by working hard and looking forward to the long term can some achievements be made. (Central News Agency Dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>Guiyang.

<h3 id="e17">Austria's Military Expansion and New Developments in the Central European Question <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>European countries have been in a state of military preparation, almost daily, since Germany openly declared its rearmament on March 16th. Britain and France have already implemented military expansion. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, taking advantage of the turbulent European situation, is further expanding his ambitious plans for external development. Italy, Austria, and Hungary also have active plans to complete their military bloc. During the opening of the Anglo-French-Italian Stresa Conference on April 11th, the Italian Prime Minister proudly positioned himself as the leader of Central Europe, proposing the expansion of armaments for Austria and Hungary. Recently, with the establishment of the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance pact and the rampant rumors of a German-Polish military secret agreement, the division of European military blocs has gradually formed a confrontational situation.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters report, Austria, with the support of Italy, disregards the wishes of the Balkan and Little Entente countries and is implementing its plan to establish an air force, organizing a special domestic defense air corps, with Deputy Prime Minister Steichenburg as the commander-in-chief. This kind of action, which disregards the Treaty of Saint-Germain, is clearly following in Germany's footsteps, dealing a serious blow to the Versailles system.</p>
<p>Examining the Central European question, since the Vienna coup in Austria last year, although it has temporarily achieved stability with the joint support of Italy and France, its underlying crisis has never been eliminated. Germany's attempts to annex Austria are still underway, and the brewing of the restoration of the Habsburg dynasty in Austria has gained considerable support from influential factions. Although the goal has not been achieved due to obstacles in international relations, the hope has never been abandoned. After Germany openly declared its military expansion, members of the Austrian Patriotic Front immediately became active, and calls for the abolition of the Treaty of Saint-Germain spread throughout the country at that time. The Italian Prime Minister, aware of the seriousness of the situation, convened the Rome Conference of Italy, Austria, and Hungary on the 4th of this month, intending to consolidate the union of the three countries, determine specific strategies for dealing with the future Danube River Conference, and serve as the basis for its diplomacy towards France and Germany. However, the outcome of the conference was not significant, and Hungary has already expressed its hesitance, because Hungary feels that its position is vulnerable to German attack and dares not openly join the anti-German bloc. As for the Little Entente and Balkan countries, they immediately became deeply concerned upon hearing the news of Austria's military expansion decision. Therefore, their relationship with Italy has tended to become estranged. Thus, the signatory countries of the Balkan Pact (namely Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Turkey) held a four-nation conference in Rome on the 10th of this month to jointly discuss countermeasures to the international environment. According to official reports, the discussions included: (1) the Mediterranean Pact plan; (2) the mutual relations between the Balkan Entente countries and Italy and the Soviet Union; and (3) the mutual economic relations between the Entente countries. At the same time, close cooperation is being conducted with the Little Entente countries. Former French Foreign Minister Pongou also participated in the conference. Upon closer examination of the truth of the conference, it can be seen that Pongou's participation actually has two roles: (1) France wants to use its position as a mediator to ease the conflict between the Balkan and Little Entente countries and Italy and Austria; (2) France wants to use diplomacy to improve Franco-Italian relations after the establishment of the Franco-Italian agreement. Both of these roles aim to deal with Germany. Now that Austria has implemented military expansion, the situation is quite volatile. Whether the relationship between the Little Entente and Balkan countries and Italy can maintain a peaceful and friendly state is currently uncertain. If the relationship between Italy and the Balkan and Little Entente countries becomes increasingly estranged due to changes in the situation, then the Danube River Nine-Nation Conference, which is about to be convened, will be difficult to proceed smoothly. If so, then France will also face new difficulties in the Central European question due to the futility of its past efforts. All of these are possible effects of Austria's implementation of military expansion plans, which those who pay attention to European issues must not ignore.</p>

<p>(Moscow) French Foreign Minister Laval and Soviet leader Molotov held talks for two days, and it is reported that they have agreed to hold a meeting to draft a multilateral pact on consultation and non-aggression, which will be supplemented by mutual assistance pacts signed by countries willing to do so. According to a joint communiqué on the results of the talks, both countries are pursuing the same goal, namely maintaining peace through the organization of universal security. It also stated that the conclusion of the Franco-Russian mutual assistance pact does not harm the purpose of establishing an Eastern European regional pact for non-aggression, consultation, and non-assistance to aggressors. The two governments will continue to work to make this pact a success. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Franco-Russian talks concluded tonight. French Foreign Minister Laval and Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov issued a joint communiqué, which stated: "The representatives of the two countries advocate continuing negotiations to link the countries that have been considered before, based on the three constraints of mutual non-aggression, mutual consultation, and non-assistance to aggressor countries, to conclude the Eastern European Regional Pact. Stalin, Molotov, and Laval unanimously advocated the organization of collective security to achieve the goal of maintaining peace, and expressed their satisfaction that the Franco-Russian mutual assistance pact has generated a spirit of trust between the two countries." The communiqué also stated that the two countries have a responsibility not to allow their defense methods to appear weak. The French national defense policy aims to maintain the military strength of the army to meet the standards of security. Stalin fully understood and completely approved of this policy. The representatives of France and Russia reiterated their determination to support the work of peace building, which can only be fully realized through the cooperation of all related countries in a spirit of freedom and sincerity. If any country is willing to cooperate, France and Russia will never refuse. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) During the Moscow talks between Stalin, Molotov, Litvinov, and Laval on May 13, 14, and 15, all expressed satisfaction with the treaty signed in Paris on May 2, 1935, which stipulated the mutual assistance obligations of France and the Soviet Union, and gave a correct interpretation of these obligations. During the review of this treaty, all issues concerning Franco-Soviet relations and the general order of Europe arising from the cooperation plan of the two governments had a beneficial impact. At the same time, it generated a friendly trust between the two countries. The representatives of the Soviet and French sides had the opportunity to state that they were fully and sincerely committed to reviewing, and they firmly believed that the continuous efforts shown by the diplomatic activities of both parties fully demonstrated that they sought only one goal, that is, to maintain peace by organizing collective security. During the exchange of views, they fully agreed that in the current international situation, all those who sincerely maintain peace and have expressed their willingness to jointly establish mutual guarantees should bear the responsibility of maintaining peace. Specifically, they want to maintain peace while never weakening their national defense strength. The French national defense policy aims to maintain a certain military force in accordance with security needs. Stalin expressed full understanding and approval of this point. On the other hand, the representatives of the two countries reiterated their determination that in this long-term cooperation, they will try their best to assist and support governments that support peace policies and create political conditions to restore trust between countries. This kind of trust is necessary for the material and spiritual interests of European countries. The representatives of the two countries reiterated that the conclusion of the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance pact has not diminished the importance of realizing the Eastern European Regional Pact. This pact will still be worked on by countries that have previously been concerned about it, and the pact contains obligations of mutual non-aggression consultation and non-assistance to aggressor countries. The two governments decided to continue to work together to find diplomatic methods and paths that are most suitable for this goal. The representatives of the Soviet and French sides, in order to publicize the above joint resolutions, made the following full responsibility statement: "The joint efforts are to complete a cause, this cause will not refuse anyone's participation, and the thorough realization of this cause requires the sincere cooperation of all relevant countries." (TASS, 16th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Judging from the communiqué jointly issued by France and Russia, the two countries have agreed to continue negotiations through diplomatic channels to enable Germany, Poland, and the Soviet Union to jointly conclude the Eastern European Regional Pact, stipulating the obligations of mutual non-aggression, mutual consultation, and non-assistance to aggressor countries between the three countries. The Franco-Russian mutual assistance pact did not intend to encircle Germany and invited Germany to participate. Now, the Franco-Russian communiqué has proposed the conclusion of the Eastern European Regional Pact, so Germany should be even more relieved. If Germany is willing to participate in the Eastern European Non-Aggression Pact this time, then European collective security will be enhanced by this organization, and Germany will also benefit from it. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Newspapers have commented on the communiqué issued from Moscow. Soviet Communist Party Central Committee General Secretary Stalin's statement in the communiqué approving of French national defense policy is particularly welcomed by newspapers. Only extreme left-wing newspapers expressed dissatisfaction. "Le Petit Parisien" said, "The person who said this is none other than Lenin's successor, the dictator of the Soviet Union, the General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, Stalin. This person has great spiritual influence on communists all over the world, including French communists." "Le Matin" is not very trusting of the promises provided by the Soviet government, saying that "If the French Communist Party does not immediately stop anti-militarist propaganda, then the Soviet authorities' prevarication is self-evident." Renowned journalist Bertina published a commentary in "L'Écho de Paris," saying, "Stalin's personal correction of the theory of the French Communist Party is extremely important. There are two reasons for this: (1) The Western European Communist Party has been denied by the Moscow Central Party. The French government only needs to have the courage to easily subdue these propagandists of pacifism (referring to the Communist Party). (2) Stalin has emerged from the mysterious shadows into the world." The Socialist Party's organ newspaper "Le Populaire" said that it is regrettable that the Franco-Russian communiqué did not mention the reduction of armaments. Stalin's approval of French national defense policy is also inappropriate. "The Soviet Union's participation in French domestic affairs was resolutely demanded by Laval. Now that Stalin has stated the reasons for France to organize national defense, those who oppose the two-year conscription system (referring to the French Communist Party) have been publicly criticized by the leader of the Third International. This is the elusive meaning of the Franco-Russian agreement." (Havas, 16th)</p>

<p>(Moscow) French Foreign Minister Laval departed from here tonight to Warsaw to represent the French government at the funeral of Polish General Pilsudski. Foreign Commissar for the People Litvinov and many dignitaries went to the station to see him off. A team of Red Army soldiers lined up to bid farewell, and military bands played the national anthems of France and Russia one after another. The crowd at the station was even larger than when Laval arrived, all cheering and paying their respects. Laval responded with "Long live Franco-Russian friendship." Before departing, Laval went to the opera house to watch a dance drama, and met with Stalin again during the intermission. The conversation was very cordial. At the end of the drama, Laval gave a radio speech, saying, "The coordination between the governments of France and Russia has become closer and closer after the signing of the mutual assistance pact, and the friendship between the two countries has been further consolidated by my visit. My conversations with the leaders of the Soviet government, especially with Mr. Stalin, were extremely candid." Laval then expressed his thanks to the Soviet authorities and people for their warm hospitality, and was very pleased with the results of this trip. (Havas, 15th)</p>

<p>(Moscow) The Soviet authorities are doing their best to demonstrate to the French delegation the strength of their support for the mutual assistance pact. Yesterday, they inspected factories, military camps, and public works. This morning, they held a large-scale air force review at a military airfield 100 kilometers away from Moscow. It is said that foreign envoys and military attachés have never been allowed to approach the airfield within 30 kilometers. This time, the French reporters accompanying Laval were also allowed to enter the forbidden area to watch the air force exercise. At the most intense moment of the exercise, 24 men and women simultaneously jumped from the same aircraft with safety parachutes. A team of the latest fighter planes flew only a few tens of feet above the ground at a speed of 450 kilometers per hour, passing over the heads of the audience. Laval then congratulated the Air Force Commander on the success. (National News Agency, 16th)</p>

<p>Prague: Representatives of Czechoslovakia and Soviet Russia today signed a mutual assistance treaty here. The content is the same as the Franco-Russian mutual assistance treaty, aiming to prevent the possibility of future wars. This is the result of repeated discussions between Czech Foreign Minister Dr. Benes and Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov in the past three weeks. If Germany and Poland still refuse to participate in the Eastern European Pact, then this treaty will replace it. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>Braha: The Soviet-Czech mutual assistance agreement was signed here today, adding another link to European peace. The signatories were Czech Foreign Minister Benes and Soviet Minister to the Czech Republic Aleksandrovsky. The principles of this agreement are the same as the Franco-Russian mutual assistance agreement signed ten days ago. It is generally believed that the conclusion of this agreement is sufficient to strengthen the Soviet Union's western border, which is no less than the Franco-Russian agreement. Therefore, it can not only increase peace in Europe, but also affect the situation in the Far East. Because the Soviet Union has the assistance of France and the Czech Republic, it can reduce Japan's coveting of Russia once it encounters an attack from a European country. Recently, rumors about Germany and Japan brewing an alliance to attack the Soviet Union have been spreading, but German and Japanese diplomats believe that these rumors are not worth refuting. Since the Soviet Union sold the Middle East Railway, Sino-Russian relations have greatly improved. If it can delineate a demilitarized zone in the future, Sino-Russian relations will definitely improve. (National Electric, 16th)</p>
<p>Czech Capital: The Czech-Soviet Union Mutual Assistance Pact was signed today by Foreign Minister Benes and Soviet Ambassador to the Czech Republic Alexandrovsky. The pact is divided into two parts. One part is the mutual assistance treaty, the terms of which are completely the same as the Franco-Soviet Union Mutual Assistance Treaty. The other part is a protocol, which stipulates the scope of application of the mutual assistance treaty. It states that only when the situation stipulated in this treaty occurs, and France implements assistance to the invaded country, will the signatory country assume the obligation of mutual assistance. According to the Czech-Soviet Union Mutual Assistance Treaty, it is related to the Rocarno Convention and supplements the Czech security system. As for the relationship between Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, and Poland, it will not be affected by this. (Havas, 16th)</p>

<p>(London) Rumors of a cabinet reshuffle and a general election in the autumn have now been revived because the Indian case will soon be over. A cabinet reshuffle has long been expected. Prime Minister MacDonald's eye disease has not healed and he is unable to bear the burden of government affairs. He has asked the government to resign for many years. Now there is a normal opportunity to redistribute. It is said that Prime Minister MacDonald and Privy Councilor Baldwin will switch positions during the Pentecost recess. The Indian case is the biggest obstacle to holding a general election. The Indian case should be passed in early August. At that time, the parliament may be dissolved without extending it. Therefore, the rumors of a general election are not unfounded. Supporters of the government believe that holding a general election in October is more beneficial to the government than holding it in the spring of next year. At present, the government's public debt credit is very high, partly because British trade has gradually recovered in the past two years, and partly because of the tense situation in Europe. When the government recently debated in the House of Commons, even the Labor Party, which opposed the government, somewhat supported the government's policy. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) The government's Indian case was submitted to the parliament committee for review. The review was completed last night, which took 30 days. It is unprecedented for the British Parliament to complete the review of such a large project in 30 days. The original case had 450 articles and 15 attachments. After the review, it has increased compared to before. In 30 days, there were 2,000 speeches, totaling 1.5 million words. On average, there were 70 statements of opinion per day. Undersecretary of the Indian Affairs Department, Butler, spoke the most, a total of 200 times. Minister of Indian Affairs, Hall, spoke 166 times. Conservative opposition leader Crawford spoke more than 150 times. Churchill and Minister of Justice Inskip each spoke 100 times. The review committee divided into groups to handle the work, and the progress was very smooth. They made concessions to each other to avoid conflicts of opinion. The third reading of the report will take six days. Then the case can be submitted to the House of Lords. The debate on the third reading of the case will be held around June 4th, 5th, and 2nd.

<p>(Geneva) The Puppet Manchukuo Foreign Ministry's Communiqué No. 67, released in Changchun on January 29th of this year, which acknowledges that among the 900,000 opium addicts within its territory, only 82,600 possess licenses, has caused great astonishment here. A spokesperson for the League of Nations' Narcotics Information Bureau stated that, according to the figures in the communiqué, licensed opium smokers constitute only a little less than 10% of the total. The 900,000 addicts in the territory consume approximately 1,642 tons of opium annually, while the 82,600 licensed addicts consume only 51 tons annually. This leaves a staggering 1,491 tons of narcotics outside of regulation. Furthermore, the communiqué states that 7 out of every 1,000 people in the territory smoke processed narcotics, totaling 210,000 people, with an annual consumption of approximately 30 tons. Where these narcotics are manufactured is a matter of great concern. (Central News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>(London) Reuters learned today that the three oil companies, Asiatic Petroleum, Socony-Vacuum, and Texaco, have decided to withdraw all of their oil and crude oil reserves from Manchukuo, given the intolerable situation created by the Manchukuo oil monopoly. It is reported that these three companies have applied to the Dalian Customs for a tax refund. Oil company personnel told a Reuters reporter that they have no hope of reaching a compromise and believe that their business in Manchukuo has come to an end. In March 1934, Japan implemented an oil industry law requiring oil companies to maintain large oil reserves in Japan, and granting Japan the right to requisition oil at negotiated prices in times of emergency. The three companies therefore argued to the Japanese government that other countries also made similar demands, but at least bore the expense of building oil storage tanks. It is widely believed that this argument will be effective in securing a satisfactory resolution. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>(Washington) Secretary of the Navy Swanson told reporters today that the U.S. fleet's maneuvers in the Pacific are not aimed at Japan. If the Japanese fleet were to conduct maneuvers in the North Pacific without entering within 2,000 miles of the U.S. West Coast, he would not object. Some say that the U.S. fleet is too close to Japanese territory. He emphasized that he has repeatedly ordered U.S. ships not to cross the 180th meridian. In the future, Japanese naval exercises may approach Hawaii even more closely than U.S. ships approach Japan. Hawaii is U.S. territory, but we do not intend to protest, as fleets must have some place to conduct maneuvers. Regarding the statement by Japanese Admiral Kato Kanji that the U.S. naval maneuver site is less than 1,250 miles or ten hours' flight from Japanese territory, he must state categorically that the U.S. naval maneuvers are not intended to test the possibility of aerial attacks. During the maneuvers, the U.S. Navy's main force, while crossing the Pacific from California to Hawaii to deploy its strategy, demonstrated an accuracy and coordination in navigation that was reportedly very satisfying to the command. According to naval authorities, this first phase was a valuable test of naval battle forces operating between widely separated bases. The maneuvers also demonstrated the capabilities of the world's most powerful submarine force. Navy personnel stated that battleships and submarines both performed very well.

<p>(Rome) According to official sources, Italy intends to maintain complete freedom of action regarding the Abyssinian situation, as the Abyssinian issue is essentially a colonial problem and should not be handled solely within the framework of the League of Nations. It should be considered within the scope of the colonial question. The Fascist government previously supported Abyssinia's entry into the League of Nations, but its intention was to encourage the Abyssinian government to abolish its barbaric practices and join the ranks of civilized nations. However, Abyssinia has not done so, and the Abyssinian government has violated the spirit of the 1928 Italian-Abyssinian treaty. If Italy were to ignore this, it would not only lose its interests but also its prestige as a civilized nation. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) Following Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's speech in the Senate yesterday, explaining the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia, the British press has largely expressed disappointment. The editorial published in this morning's Times is representative, stating: "At a time when the world hopes for a moderation of the situation in East Africa, the Italian Prime Minister's speech was devoid of conciliatory tone. He implied that the prestige of the white race in Abyssinia is in danger of collapsing and that European powers should allow the country to be ravaged." The editorial continues, "While Abyssinian politics are indeed corrupt, the Emperor is a reformer. He is unafraid of criticism as he implements new policies, as has often been the case. Even in the current dispute between Italy and Abyssinia, the Abyssinian Emperor initially suggested submitting the matter to arbitration in accordance with the 1928 bilateral agreement. Both countries had signed a treaty stipulating that disputes should not be resolved by force. Furthermore, regarding the 1906 tripartite agreement between Britain, France, and Italy, the three countries agreed not to interfere in Abyssinia without prior consultation. However, no agreement has been reached between Britain, France, and Italy, and Italy is acting aggressively. Britain and France should therefore exert all their efforts to achieve a peaceful resolution." (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>

<h3 id="e34">U.S. Congress Proposes Stabilizing International Currency, Aims to Authorize President to Convene Conference <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Concrete proposals to stabilize the international monetary system have surfaced in Congress today. The proposer is expansionist leader Thomas, who advocates authorizing the President to convene an international monetary conference. However, this proposal has apparently not received the support of the administration. According to the Associated Press, New Deal leaders do not wish to initiate the convening of such a conference, due to the negative experiences the U.S. had during the 1933 London Economic Conference. However, Secretary of State Hull issued a formal statement today, expressing the need for mutual agreement on the current state of the world's monetary systems. According to the State Department's announcement, Hull believes that international monetary stability is an important part of the U.S. foreign trade plan. Therefore, he highly commended Treasury Secretary Morgenthau's speech on Monday evening. Hull did not mention whether an international conference was possible. Hull said, "Unstable exchange rates have indeed caused confusion in the world market, but I believe this is only a transitional situation. The fact that international trade can be maintained in the current difficult circumstances shows that this trade truly meets the real needs of the world. The U.S. is continuing its efforts to restore foreign trade, while also seeking to avoid the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. Many other governments are also adopting this policy. However, extreme manipulation of exchange rates is not a long-term solution, so to expand international trade, we must seek exchange rate stability." (National Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the U.S. Treasury Secretary's speech on Monday on currency stability and Secretary of State Hull's recent statement that currency stability is an important part of the U.S. trade program, sources here believe that it is purely gratuitous and only seeks to shift the responsibility of initiating negotiations to Britain. Although the statements by American politicians have indeed aroused interest in currency stabilization, British authorities, given the situation in Europe and America, may not be willing to easily accept the responsibility of initiating negotiations. The value of the U.S. dollar, which the British still view as being undervalued in terms of the pound sterling, remains a concern. At the same time, London circles still feel apprehensive about the future of the gold standard, as the difficulties of the French treasury and budget have not been alleviated by the issuance of short-term and long-term bonds in Paris. However, many influential British and American figures believe that the current international trade routes are blocked by quotas and high tariffs. The only way to unclog them is through currency stabilization. One important financier, in a general comment on the current situation, said that although the benefits of currency stabilization are widely recognized, no country is prepared to act first, for fear that other countries will later devalue their currency and gain a trade advantage.

<p>(Tokyo) A 15-year-old Japanese boy, Ishida, driven by curiosity, attempted to sail from Yokohama to Singapore. Last night, he secretly boarded a yacht moored in Yokohama port and, after a fifteen-minute interval, cast off. He hoped for a smooth sailing to his destination. This morning, Lieutenant Commander Master, a military attaché at the French Embassy in Tokyo, discovered that his yacht was missing and immediately reported it to the Water Police Bureau. Shortly after the search began, the ship was found floating several miles outside Yokohama port. By this time, Ishida had lost heart and, though no longer concerned with life or death, was suffering terribly from seasickness. There had been a strong wind the previous night, and Ishida, unfamiliar with sailing techniques, was helpless. Although he tried to steer back to Yokohama, he was unable to and allowed the ship to drift. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Liu Yinful, Director of the Department of Industry, stated that the industrial control measures proposed by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce are passive and not applicable to the present situation. After receiving the proposal, the Ministry, recognizing the wide scope of control, decided to solicit opinions from various provinces and cities to ensure smooth implementation. The proposal has been distributed to various provinces and cities for their opinions, and the Ministry is also studying it in detail. The implementation date is currently difficult to determine. Regarding the cotton industry control measures proposed by the Cotton Industry Control Committee, the Ministry has conducted a preliminary study and found that the content is entirely focused on reducing factory workers and increasing working hours. This would result in even more unemployed workers. In the current state of industrial recession, suddenly laying off workers and increasing the number of unemployed is not a good strategy. The feasibility of these measures is still under consideration. (Special dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Song Yuanquan, the commander of the fake Fujian-Jiangxi Military Region (also known as Zheng Hanqi), was a remnant of Fang Zhimin's troops. The band had fake regiments such as the 12th, 17th, 18th, and 19th, and harassed northern Fujian. After Wei Lihuang, Li Moan, and others sent teams to suppress them, the bandits fled through Qingliu, Ninghua, Youxi, and Sha County, entering Guilin in Datian. They were intercepted by the 9th Security Regiment. Song led the fake 12th and 19th regiments, totaling more than 600 people, and fled to Liuyuan between Xianyou and Yongtai. They were already close to the coastal plain, like entering a dead end with no way out. In addition, they were hungry and exhausted. Lin Chong and Wang Zhigang of the Xianyou Security Brigade lured them to Duwei Town, providing them with food and clothing. Song, in dire straits, surrendered to the Xianyou County Government. Lin and Wang, together with Song and the fake Chief of Staff Xu Jianghan, went to the county town on the 9th to negotiate, and then went to Duwei with Deng Jun, the director of the screening department, to inspect. At that time, the Quanzhou Third Pacification Command, based on a report, dispatched the 49th and 50th regiments of the 25th Brigade of the 9th Division to Xianyou, and disarmed all the bandits, capturing more than 600 people and more than 400 rifles. Not a single one escaped. Song Yuanquan, Xu Jianghan, and fifteen other officers, including Peng Hu, the fake director of the political department, Wu Jinren and Zhang Tianquan, the fake battalion commanders, Wang Weisheng and Zuo Longwu, the fake political commissars, Zhou Yi, Yang Liangsheng, and Zhang Xiangbiao, the fake company instructors, Su Huawei, Ruan Douyuan, Yang Zhikun, and Yu Longsheng, the fake company adjunct instructors, and Jiang Cuiying (female), the fake local work team, were all arrested. According to Song, the 12th and 19th regiments under his command had about 1,400 people. Because they were surrounded on all sides by the National Army in the bandit area (between Jianning and Ninghua), they could not stand their ground, so they marched secretly at night, leaving the bandit area, passing through Guihua, Qingliu, Youxi, and Datian, and arriving in Xianyou. They were intercepted by the National Army along the way, leaving only six or seven hundred people and four or five hundred guns. Later, they learned that the 9th Division had sent troops to surround and suppress them in Yongxian, and they had no way to go, so they rushed to the Xianyou County Government to request surrender. However, Zhong Xunren, the fake political commissar and secretary of the military region, led dozens of members of the fake regimental headquarters and fled back to the bandit area, and so on. Song and the other fifteen people were escorted to the Quanzhou Pacification Command on the 14th and will be transferred to the Zhangzhou Pacification Headquarters. As for the fake 17th and 18th countries, they are being pursued very closely by Yang's regiment of the 83rd Division. They fled to Chishui in Dehua on the 11th and were blocked by the 9th Security Regiment and the 52nd Division. They were surrounded on all sides on Shantouping on the 12th, and the solution should not be far away. (May 16)</p>
<h3 id="e92">Zichuan: Tragic Disaster at the Luda Mine: More Than 800 Miners, More Than 600 Dead <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: According to a special report from Zichuan, at about 11 AM on the 13th of this month, at the Zichuan Hongshan Sino-Japanese joint venture Luda Company mine, the hole cover suddenly collapsed, and the old, abandoned, and empty water broke through the stones that had been blocked the hole and rushed out. In less than half an hour, the cave water had filled the tunnels. In addition, the electric water pumps exploded when they came into contact with the water, making pumping difficult. Therefore, the water grew stronger and larger. There were about 800 miners in the pit working. No more than 200 people escaped. The remaining 600 people were blocked in the pit by the water. As of 10 PM on the 14th, a long-distance telephone call was received from Zichuan, which said that the factory was rescuing and pumping water, and Zichuan County Magistrate and Garrison Commander Ning were maintaining order at the scene. The families of the workers who were broken into pieces heard the news and all went to the mine to inquire about the news, gathering outside the door and crying loudly. The situation was extremely tragic, a rare disaster in recent years. The details of the various situations are recorded below:</p>
<p>Luda's Evolution: Since the Cao County religious case occurred in the former Qing Dynasty, the Qing government and the Germans signed the Jiaozhou Bay lease treaty, which included a mining item. In the 27th year of Guangxu (1901), the Germans organized the German-Chinese Company to mine minerals in Fangzi, Jinling Town, Zichuan and other places. When the European War broke out, the Germans' power to plunder was transferred to the Japanese. After seven years, at the Washington Conference in the eleventh year of the Republic of China, the Sino-Japanese Luda Company was organized based on the treaty. The Zichuan coal mine is part of the company, named the Zichuan Mining Office of Luda Company, about four miles southeast of Zichuan City, in a place called Hongshan, commonly known as Dahuangdi. Luda calls itself the main pit of the Zichuan Mining Office. The current director is Japanese Ichikichi Tetsuo, and the associate director and standing director, vice director is Chinese Song Biru.</p>
<p>Organization Below the Pit: The Luda Zichuan Mining Office mine has two wells, north and south. The south well is larger in scale and has important machinery. Currently, the north well has a richer output and the coal washing stove is larger than the south well, so coal is currently produced in the north well. The pit tunnels are divided into two roads, eight layers and ten layers. From the ground to the eighth layer, it is 180 meters deep (about 50 zhang). Lifting and lowering are purely powered by steam. From the eighth layer to the tenth layer, up and down are powered by electricity, a distance of 320 meters from the ground (about 90 zhang). Underground travel is purely by electric car. Some tunnels are more than a dozen miles long. The average monthly coal output of the main and outer pits of Luda is about 2,000 tons. In addition to the 14 tons required by the Jiaoji Railway, most of it is sold in Shanghai, Qingdao and other places.</p>
<p>Circumstances of the Disaster: The sturdiness of the tunnel project in the mine has a direct relationship with the lives of the miners. Therefore, the factory's saving of labor and materials is not only opposed by the workers, but also prohibited by the factory law. The death rate of Luda has always been higher than other mines. The tragedy that occurred this time is said to be due to the mine's recent removal of all the coal pillars in the tunnel. Since the Japanese Ichikichi and the Chinese Song Biru took office, they replaced most of the old people in the mine and cleared out all the coal pillars in the mine. At about 11 AM on the 13th of this month, the stones on the top floor of the tenth layer in the mine were washed away by water. At the same time, the 74th abandoned flood water destroyed the plug stones. In less than half an hour, each road was blocked. The electric water pumps were stepped up to pump water. In fear, there was another explosion. Therefore, the water became more and more increased. If the miners working in the tenth floor wanted to get out of the well, they had to pass through the eighth floor before they could reach the top. At this time, a total of more than 800 people were submerged together. Ning Chunxiao, the brigade commander of the 64th Brigade stationed in Zichuan, and Zhang Yunzao, the county magistrate, rushed to the scene after hearing the alarm and dispatched troops and husbands to assist the Luda Company in rescuing the submerged workers and maintaining order. They rescued only more than 200 people. It is not yet known whether the remaining 600 people were drowned in the well or were calling to find other places to avoid the water. However, it is really difficult to get out of danger for a while.</p>
<p>In the Rescue: Most of the miners are residents of nearby areas. When the families heard the news, they were all frightened and gathered outside the gate of the mine to inquire about the news. They all believed that it was more ominous than auspicious and cried loudly. Tonight, this reporter inquired about the news by long-distance telephone. It was said that the water had not yet receded, and the mine was trying to find a way to rescue the workers, stepping up efforts to pump water outwards. It was also said that the water could be completely pumped out a week later. It is still difficult to predict whether these 600 people can be rescued. It is really an unprecedented tragedy in the coal mines of Shandong Province.</p>
<p>Another News: Zichuan Telegram. At 11:25 AM on the 13th, a large amount of water suddenly occurred at the No. 75 coal mining place in the second vertical pit of Luda Zichuan. The water was turbulent and the traffic was cut off. For about 40 minutes, although there was a water pump, the water pump could not move due to the water filling the bottom of the well, losing its effectiveness. About 400 workers under the kiln, as well as Japanese engineer Aihara Zōzō and surveyor Yuan Rongfang, are unknown. The Chinese and Japanese staff of the company, although they tried their best to rescue, but all the dozen or so water pumps were not applicable, and they were extremely anxious. The water rose higher and higher, but they could only wail helplessly. By the evening, they had not been able to rescue anyone. On the 8th, the tunnel was unable to ventilate due to carbonic acid gas, and there were about 200 workers above the 19th coal mining place who had not been rescued. The company reported to the company's important staff in Qingdao on the one hand, and organized a death squad to go down to the kiln to rescue on the other hand. However, due to excessive gas, they could not approach. After the Luda vertical pit was flooded, the water rose one meter per hour. By 3 AM on the 14th, it was only 18 meters from the wellhead, and the first vertical pit was also in great danger. According to the usual practice, water gushes out from the bottom of the well in coal pits, so workers can escape. The Luda tragedy this time was actually caused by the sudden outbreak of a large amount of water in the middle of the well, causing hundreds of workers to be unable to escape. Now that the water pumps in the well cannot be used, new water pumps have been urgently purchased to pump water outside the well to salvage hundreds of remains. It is said that it will take about a week to salvage them. (15th)</p>
<h3 id="e93">Shanxi Discoveries of Ancient Shang and Zhou Artifacts; Rumors of Private Sales by Corrupt Officials and Gentry; Antiquities Preservation Committee Sends Letter to Inquire <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Beijing Dispatch: It has come to light that ancient Shang and Zhou artifacts were recently discovered in Hunyuan County, Shanxi Province. There are now rumors that these artifacts are being sold to foreign merchants. The Beijing office of the Antiquities Preservation Committee has sent a letter to local gentry in the county to investigate the truth. The original letter stated (excerpts omitted): "We recently received a document transferred from the National Palace Museum in Beijing, which states that the Shang and Zhou bronzes unearthed in Hunyuan are truly rare treasures. It would be a great pity if they were dispersed. Our office is responsible for their preservation and cannot allow corrupt officials and gentry to freely dispose of them. We are unsure whether they are still within the country. Could you please ascertain the current address of the former county magistrate, Yuan Xinghua, and report the dates of the discovery and the process of the illicit sales, providing factual information. It would be best if you could come to Beijing in person to explain." (excerpts omitted)</p>
<p>Previously, on the evening of the thirteenth day of the first month of the old lunar calendar in the twelfth year of the Republic [1923], Gao Fengshan, a villager from Dongyu Village, fifteen li southwest of Hunyuan County, discovered ancient artifacts in his farmland. He then exerted his strength to excavate them. Aside from gold and jade items, the finds consisted entirely of ancient bronzes. Gao Fengshan, being a farmer, initially did not know that these were valuable antiques. He gradually dispersed them, keeping only the ones that were easy to sell. News of the bronze artifacts then reached a Mr. Yu, who purchased some. This caused a sensation. The then-magistrate of Hunyuan County, Xie Encheng, upon hearing of this matter, immediately ordered the county police officer Zuo Chengwei to go to Dongyu to investigate. Aside from what Gao Fengshan had kept, they obtained a total of thirty-six sets, large and small, which were temporarily displayed in the county library.</p>
<p>Around the thirteenth and fourteenth years of the Republic [1924-1925], antique dealers from Beijing and Tianjin heard the news and flocked to appraise them. A French merchant offered 40,000 yuan, but the deal was put on hold due to the Yan-Feng War. At that time, general epigraphers were unable to determine which dynasty the artifacts were from. In the fifteenth year of the Republic [1926], a certain county gentleman purchased them for 40,000 yuan, but only paid a small portion of the money at the time, agreeing to pay the remainder by the eighteenth year of the Republic [1929]. Unexpectedly, the gentleman passed away the following year, and his son inherited the property, halting the payments. It was not until the twenty-first year of the Republic [1932] that the county gentry intervened and retrieved the artifacts. A Mr. Ma identified them as ritual vessels from the Shang and Zhou dynasties, of great value. Subsequently, antique dealers from Beijing offered 100,000 yuan to purchase them, but the offer was rejected. Therefore, the gentry and scholars of the county agreed that they would not sell them for less than 500,000 yuan. As a result, even an offer of 300,000 yuan was not accepted. Currently, the Antiquities Preservation Committee is paying close attention to the progress of this matter. There are rumors that the artifacts may be transported to Taiyuan or sold privately. Meanwhile, the gentry of Hunyuan County are appealing to all parties for assistance. (13th)</p>
<h3 id="e94">Songjiang Typhoon Destroys Seawall <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The Jinshanwei (Tuolin) area in the eighth district of this county is coastal and has a seawall to protect the inland. During the typhoon in the eleventh year of the Republic [1922], it was once destroyed. With the approval of the provincial authorities, the former Director of Construction Bureau, Xu Baikui, allocated funds to repair it using new methods. Recently, it was hit by another strong typhoon, causing sections four and six of the seawall to be washed away for tens of zhang, scattered in disarray, with a total length of over a hundred zhang, which is extremely dangerous. The Seawall Engineering Bureau reported this to the county government for review.

<p>Recently, the Yang Ji Opium Shop in the city was reported for harboring prostitutes.陆建芬 Lu Jianfen, a patrol officer from the First Precinct, led police to arrest a man and a woman. The next day, the local "Great Songjiang Daily" reported the incident, stating that the captured female patron, a local prostitute named Zhang Pinxian, was the daughter of a Mr. Yang from Dongwai, named Yang Pinguan. Mr. Yang claimed that although he had once had an adopted daughter, she had been expelled long ago, and the arrested Zhang Pinxian was completely unrelated. He sent a letter to the newspaper requesting a correction, but the newspaper received a registered letter containing blank white paper with no words. The newspaper's editor deemed it suspicious and reported it to the Public Security Bureau and published a statement in an advertisement. Yang Jinbiao, believing that the newspaper had not made a legally required correction, considered it a public insult and filed a lawsuit in the county court, seeking legal action. It is reported that the court has scheduled a hearing for the twenty-third.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Telephone Fee Increase Postponement Case: Negotiations Underway, Public Works Committee of the Municipal Council Accepts Meeting Minutes <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The Public Works Committee of the Municipal Council convened a meeting on May 10th to discuss the telephone company's request for a telephone fee increase and the issue of telephone charges in the Chinese-administered areas of Shanghai. The minutes of the meeting were submitted to the Municipal Council's board meeting this past Wednesday. Regarding the issue of telephone charges in the Chinese-administered areas, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, based on requests from taverns and 37 other organizations, requested the cancellation of the five-cent telephone charge in the Chinese-administered areas, arguing that since they are all within the same city of Shanghai, telephone charges should not be levied separately, as this hinders business. The telephone company refuted this, stating that the charge was based on a contract signed on December 19, 1925, between the Chinese authorities and the Shanghai Telephone Company and has been collected since the contract was signed. Moreover, the so-called "Cross-Boundary Road Construction Contract" signed between the Chinese Telephone Bureau and the Shanghai Telephone Company on April 19, 1933, also included this point, arguing that given Shanghai's vast urban area, wouldn't it be appropriate to levy extra telephone charges, as is done in New York and London? When the Public Works Committee discussed this matter, the secretary stated that telephone charges in the Chinese-administered areas should be determined by the two telephone authorities in the Chinese areas. Only if the charge is cancelled and telephone fees in the foreign-administered areas must be increased to compensate the telephone company's losses would this be a matter for the Municipal Council. It was noted that of the five-cent charge, three cents went to the Shanghai Telephone Company and two cents to the Chinese Telephone Bureau. The accountant and administrator stated that telephone charges in the Chinese-administered areas were an important source of revenue for the telephone company, and they believed that this case should be discussed after the issue of telephone fees within the foreign-administered areas is resolved. During the discussion, it was generally agreed that according to telephone statistics, the number of calls from the Chinese-administered areas was greater, so the benefits to telephone subscribers in the Chinese-administered areas were actually greater than those in the foreign-administered areas. The committee lacked the authority to change the contract signed by both parties. The committee should call the telephone company's attention to the fallacy of levying telephone charges in the Chinese-administered areas, but the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce should provide special evidence. The committee suggested to the Municipal Council that this case should be postponed until a decision is made on the telephone fee increase in the foreign-administered areas. Next, the issue of the telephone fee increase in the foreign-administered areas was discussed. The secretary presented a memorandum on this issue and the process of the telephone company's request for a fee increase. On April 18th, the foreign ratepayers' annual meeting passed a resolution requesting the Municipal Council to renegotiate with the telephone company, postpone the fee increase, and organize a special telephone committee to allow sufficient time to discuss this case. On May 8th, the telephone company requested approval of the May bills, which were consistent with April. The issue lies in the Municipal Council's responsibility for the telephone company's losses starting from April, as the Council is responsible for delaying the implementation of the new telephone rates starting April 1st. The committee recommended to the Municipal Council that it approve the company's request for May bills to be consistent with April. Regarding the resolution passed by the foreign ratepayers' annual meeting, the committee observed that it could be divided into two points: "(1) The Municipal Council should begin negotiations with the telephone company to postpone the fee increase; (2) Organize a special telephone committee and invite one or more experts to join the committee." The Public Works Committee strongly supports negotiating with the telephone company. When the Municipal Council discussed the committee's recommendations, it was stated that informal negotiations were underway. The Municipal Council approved the proposal to formally negotiate with the telephone company to postpone the fee increase and passed the Public Works Committee's meeting minutes in their entirety.</p>

It was flying a red flag and carried 260 bags of raw sugar, five pieces of rayon, three bags of salt, and some bird's nest, worth a total of 7,000 yuan. The seven Chinese people on board have been detained for investigation. It is reported that the vessel sailed from Taiwan and anchored outside the Wusongkou, waiting for an opportunity to unload the goods ashore. The shipowner was Japanese and was also on board. Upon seeing the customs patrol boats approaching, all escaped in small boats. The cargo has been confiscated and will be auctioned off.</p>

<p>The Ta Kung Pao reports that since overseas Chinese in Siam were illegally oppressed by the Siamese government, they dispatched representatives to form a petition delegation to return to China, requesting negotiations with the central government and appealing to various organizations to implement a boycott of Siamese rice imports. Sino-Siamese relations suddenly became strained. To understand the situation in China and negotiate a treaty, the Siamese authorities specially sent Customs Tax Commissioner Mr. Swardt to China to investigate trade conditions and to negotiate a commercial treaty with the Chinese government. While passing through Japan, he exchanged informal opinions with Mr. Jiang Zuobin, the Chinese Ambassador to Japan. Yesterday, the Siamese commercial organization stationed in Shanghai received a telegram from Mr. Swardt stating that he would soon leave Japan for China and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 21st of this month.</p>
<p>Invitation to All Sectors to Discuss Assistance. The Reorganization Committee of the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Federation, in order to thoroughly assist overseas Chinese oppressed in Siam, has specifically scheduled a discussion on concrete assistance measures at the YMCA in the Eight Immortals Bridge tomorrow afternoon at 1:00 PM. It has already sent letters to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai General Labor Union, and organizations related to trade with Siam, requesting them to send one representative to attend and participate in joint discussions.</p>
<p>Rice Merchants Across the Country Voluntarily Boycott. After the delegation representing overseas Chinese oppressed in Siam from the Overseas Chinese Federation sent letters to chambers of commerce and rice industry organizations in Shanghai, Guangdong, Fujian, Shantou, Hong Kong, and other places, requesting a boycott of Siamese rice imports to awaken the Siamese government, rice industry organizations in various places have held temporary meetings separately. The result was a decision to voluntarily boycott. Of the 600,000 bags of Siamese rice previously ordered by Shanghai rice merchants from Hengfeng Rice Store, 385,000 bags have already been shipped to Shanghai, and the remaining 215,000 bags will be fully shipped to Shanghai and settled by the end of this month, after which no further orders will be placed.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Relief Plan for Displaced Overseas Chinese, Joint Review Meeting by Public Security, Social Affairs, and Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureaus <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Jian Jinglun, Director of the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, once held a joint meeting with the Public Security and Social Affairs Bureaus regarding the relief of displaced overseas Chinese returning to the country and drafted a relief plan. Now, after Director Yin Guanzhi of the Public Security Bureau prepared a plan, it is scheduled to be decided at another joint meeting at the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau on the 18th of this month and implemented immediately. The proposed measures are as follows: (A) Relief Principles: 1. All displaced overseas Chinese forced to return to the country and arriving in Shanghai will be jointly responsible for relief by the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, Social Affairs Bureau, and Public Security Bureau. 2. Relief should be provided to those who are indeed forced to return to the country, lack the ability to live, and are at risk of becoming destitute. 3. Relief will be based on repatriation to their place of origin. In special circumstances, after verification, they may be sent to other areas to find friends and relatives and seek other livelihoods. 4. If it is found that overseas Chinese, although forced to return to the country, have the ability to return to their place of origin on their own, they will not be provided with relief, but if they request care, it will be handled at any time. (B) Relief Measures: 1. Whenever displaced overseas Chinese arrive, whether discovered or self-reported, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau must verify and register them and be responsible for assessing whether relief is necessary. 2. Once the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau has verified the displaced overseas Chinese, it will notify the Public Security Bureau of their address, order them to take care of them properly, and send a letter to the Social Affairs Bureau to be responsible for repatriation to their place of origin. However, if the hometown association of the displaced overseas Chinese declares that it has the ability to do so, it may send a letter to the hometown association to repatriate them. 3. If a large number of displaced overseas Chinese return to the country and the situation is very special, and the Social Affairs Bureau and the hometown association lack the ability to repatriate them, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau may submit a special request to the government for relief. 4. If there are displaced overseas Chinese who have fallen into depravity and are unwilling to return to their place of origin and are sufficient to affect public order, they may be forcibly repatriated. (C) Procedures: 1. Registration must record in detail from which country they were forced to return, the circumstances of their forced return, and their economic situation to facilitate investigation. 2. Assessment should be as realistic as possible, and notification should be simple and quick. 3. Repatriation and care should be as quick and efficient as possible to achieve results.</p>

<p>The Great Alliance for National Goods Committee believes that of the 5 million in credit loans organized by the silver and banking industries, the amount currently confirmed by all parties is only 2.5 million from the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, 1 million from the Bankers' Association, and 250,000 from the Money Shops Association, totaling 3.75 million yuan. Although efforts are still underway to solicit the remaining amount, there have been no concrete results, and industry and commerce are eagerly awaiting relief. The committee has decided to request the Ministry of Finance to promptly order the silver and banking industries to first lend out the confirmed amount, and continue to raise the remainder to avoid further delays. It is reported that the silver and banking industries also advocate for first implementing the loan, and opinions are currently being exchanged, with a decision expected in the coming days.</p>

Mr. Yu believes that the aviation industry is one of China's emerging industries and is of great importance to the future of transportation in China. Therefore, he inquired in detail about the facilities and recent developments of the two companies and discussed plans for developing aviation in China.

<p>According to the Central News Agency, there has been a rumor that the Guangdong sugar industry loan has been agreed with the Shanghai Bank to borrow 200,000 yuan, and that the contract procedures have been completed. Yesterday, according to the person in charge of the bank, this news is completely untrue. There has been no mention of the sugar industry loan at all, and there is no such thing at the Guangzhou branch. As for the proposal of the Water Conservancy Reclamation Company to borrow 3 million yuan from the banking industry, according to reporters' inquiries to various related banks, it was said that this matter had been discussed earlier, but the banks in Shanghai are under pressure due to tight monetary policy and lack of surplus funds, so it is unlikely to materialize.</p>

The matters discussed were as follows: (1) Send a letter to the Association for National Goods to help revitalization to urge donations. It was resolved to do so and asked Hu Fengxiang to forward the letter. (2) Use the name of Director Cha Fang to send a letter to the Charity Associations of various provinces to continue allocating 50,000 shi of passports. The previous allocation of 25,000 shi has been used up, and the continuing allocation of relief funds, together with the relief funds raised by various counties, must be used to purchase rice for relief. In addition, the National Goods Revitalization Conference jointly organized by the association and the Chinese National Products Manufacturers Association is a performance of Peking Opera tomorrow to raise large sums of money for relief. Yesterday, the Manufacturers Association sent a letter to the association, which read in part, "The Shanghai National Goods Movement Revitalization Conference initiated by your association and our association has been open for more than two weeks. Due to the sluggish market and poor business, the relief funds raised from amusement tickets are only over 400 yuan, which is a difference of one-fifth compared to the income of over 2,000 yuan from the amusement department of the Shanghai National Goods Movement Conference held by our association in the same place two years ago. This is unexpected. National goods revitalization has been promoted for a long time, but the result is like this. In fact, it is impossible to muddle through. Our association has specially initiated the hiring of famous amateur actors in the city to perform voluntary Peking Opera for one day on the 18th of this month. The proceeds from the tickets will still be used for relief. All the drama tickets, in addition to a large part being underwritten by the manufacturers participating in the conference, have not been sold externally."</p>

<p>According to the Municipal Finance Bureau, starting from the summer of this year, property taxes of ten yuan or more in the urban area will be paid by the taxpayers themselves to the tax collection offices, and the collection was scheduled to begin on the 16th, as reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday was the first day of collection, and citizens went to the tax collection offices of the Finance Bureau very enthusiastically, especially in the north and south, where there were two or three hundred households each. Some even went directly to the main office at Fenglin Bridge because they were not familiar with the bureau's method of collecting property taxes. It is found that urban property taxes are collected by the four tax collection offices in the east, south, west, and north. All property tax tickets are stored in the tax collection offices. This time, the self-payment notice for ten yuan or more stated which office to pay to, but some taxpayers did not read carefully, resulting in wasted trips.</p>

<p>The Chinese Women's Temperance Association at 206 Yuanmingyuan Road, in view of the deepening unemployment suffered by women below the middle class in this city, the main reason for which is that there is no way to promote the sale of their products and no way to make a living, resulting in their inability to be economically independent, suggested at the board meeting on the 12th of this month that the association immediately establish a women's production cooperative. The business will be carried out in two parts: (1) Establish a women's cooperative store to sell all kinds of women's production products; (2) Establish vocational training classes, including crafts, business, cooking, and secretarial services classes, and also set up advanced English classes and literacy classes so that those who are illiterate can learn to read and those whose English proficiency is very shallow and cannot be used can further their studies. All the directors present unanimously approved the proposal, and Ms. Chen Yi, Director of the Home Economics Department of Yenching University, Ms. Wang Bimeng, former editor of the women's section of the Continental Newspaper, Mrs. Wu Laoweiqing, wife of Mr. Cao Yongxiang, chairman of the Board of Directors of Industrial and Commercial Management, and others are being selected to form a committee to actively prepare for the establishment.</p>

He opened room No. 13 of the hotel, signed the register as Wang Yineng, 26 years old, from Ningbo. After paying the room fee, he immediately closed the door and went to bed alone. At that time, the hotel waiter saw that his attitude was calm and did not suspect anything else. It was only until noon yesterday that the waiter called him to get up as usual, but there was no response from room No. 13. Suspecting something was wrong, he hurriedly reported to the accountant to find a way to pry the door open. He only saw the young man lying stiff on the bed with a pale face, already unconscious. Half a bottle of Laemiaoer medicine was left on the table, which was obviously a suicide by poisoning. The hotel reported to the Laoza Gate Police Station and sent him to Renji Hospital.

<p>The Chuanshan ship of Chuanshan Shipping Company, weighing 1,029 tons, which traveled on the line of Dinghai Shipu and Haimen Chuanshan, left the Jinliyuan Xinjiangtian Wharf at 5:10 pm on the 15th. As soon as the ship left the wharf, the bow turned south and turned its head with the tide. Then the Ning Shao Si Boban ship Xin Shao (3,407 tons) also drove north from the No. 1 Wharf of Nanshi at this time, and the drum ship went down with the current, just in time for the bow of Chuanshan. It was too late to avoid it, causing a collision. The outer side of the iron plate and the angle iron of the right side of the bow of the Chuanshan ship and the small door, etc., were all damaged. The front cabin of the second calendar A was also found to be broken due to the violent collision. After the owner of Chuanshan invited the chief mate of the Xinning Shao ship to the Chuanshan ship to inspect the damaged parts and register them to prepare for negotiations, he reported to the Jianghai Customs and the company, and then each sailed out. The damage to Chuanshan was at the upper end of the ship's body, which did not hinder navigation. Chuanshan Company plans to wait until next Tuesday, when the Chuanshan ship returns to Shanghai, and then ask a notary to inspect the damage, estimate the loss, and demand compensation from Ning Shao Company. The document of Chuanshan Shipping Company's report to the Customs Maritime Administration and the insurance company yesterday is recorded as follows: This past Wednesday at 5:10 pm, the Chuanshan ship sailed from the Xinjiangtian Wharf, the ship's head was heading south, and the tide was falling.

The chief mate of Xinning Shao has already inspected the ship. Chuanshan immediately sailed out, and will ask the engineer to inspect it next Tuesday when it returns to Shanghai and formally negotiate compensation with Ning Shao Company.</p>

<p>Superstitious people have traditionally regarded the eighth day of the fourth lunar month as the Bathing Buddha Festival. On this day, Jing'an Temple in western Shanghai holds a Buddhist ceremony, attracting a continuous stream of women devotees. Taking advantage of this opportunity, small vendors set up stalls near the temple to sell various goods, a practice that has been going on for a long time. Subsequently, the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which is in charge of the area, found that the number of stallholders increased year by year, setting up stalls along the roadside in a disorderly manner. Therefore, regulations were created for stallholders to obtain licenses, dividing the stall locations and setting up stalls according to the designated locations to avoid disputes. As for the license application procedures, stallholders had to go to Jing'an Temple in advance to</p>
<p>Register</p>
<p>Each stallholder paid a license fee of four yuan and sixty cents. The temple collected the names of all stallholders and submitted them to the Donation Office to apply for business licenses before setting up stalls for trade. The police station also dispatched special officers to the scene to protect them. Although these markets were held only for a short period of time, the transactions were very prosperous, so the number of stallholders increased year by year, reportedly reaching as many as 1,600 households. Those who obtained licenses earned more profits, which aroused the envy of Wang Dezhang. Wang is a member of the 34th branch of the Citizens' Association and resides in a cigarette and paper shop at No. 148 Hart Road. Before this year's</p>
<p>Bathing Buddha Festival</p>
<p>He gathered Feng Guangjia, Wu Youchun, and others to organize a so-called Jing'an Temple Incense Fair Stallholders' Association, with the sole purpose of applying for licenses on behalf of the incense fair stallholders. They notified the stallholders to register with the association first, paying a registration fee of one yuan per household. At the same time, they negotiated with the abbot of Jing'an Temple to transfer the license application business, but the temple was unwilling to let go of its vested interests and rejected the request. This matter was heard by the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which believed that they were fabricating a name to</p>
<p>Extort Money</p>
<p>So four days before the Bathing Buddha Festival, they arrested Wang and searched his home, finding seventeen books of printed receipts, as well as leaflets, seals, and other items. However, he denied recognizing Tang Zihong and Tan Yueguan Huchen. An investigation revealed that Wang had printed a total of twenty receipt books, but three books were missing, indicating that some stallholders had undoubtedly been deceived. The police lawyer, Zhang Shizhu, filed a public prosecution on charges of fraud. The First Special District Court submitted a proposal for inquiry and deliberated on releasing him on bail of nine hundred yuan to await further investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiang Yinghua conducted a further interrogation. Wang Wuzhang confessed that he had received ninety-five yuan in registration fees from the stallholders, but because of</p>
<p>Police Intervention</p>
<p>He had refunded seventy-nine yuan, leaving only sixteen yuan. He also claimed that the Incense Fair Stallholders' Association was initiated and organized with Feng and Wu, but it had not been officially established yet. The original site of the association, all the meeting minutes, and other documents were kept by the clerk Tu Qing. Because Wang has gone to Hangzhou, he was unable to submit them for inspection. According to the report, the police heard Wang's statement and immediately declared that it was probably not true, requesting that the bail be revoked and Wang be detained, and that all the books and documents be quickly transferred to the case to prevent the destruction of evidence. The judge deliberated and changed the defendant's bail to one thousand yuan, and immediately sent police to seize the books. The case was returned for further investigation.</p>

<p>Xu Zhenjiu, an Anhui native, 31 years old, lived with his wife at No. 128 Lafayette Road in the French Concession of this port. He worked at the Lihua Sock Factory at No. 35 Shoufu Lane, Caishi Road, French Concession. A new female worker, Zhu Liubao, entered the factory to learn the trade, and was taught by Su Desheng, an Anhui native. Su asked the female worker for two yuan for a treat, but the female worker did not have the money at the time, so she pawned a woolen shirt for one yuan and six jiao, still short of six jiao. It was agreed that she would pay the remaining amount when she received her salary. When salaries were paid a few days ago, Su Desheng asked the female worker for the money but failed to get it, and an argument broke out. The female worker went home and told her husband.

<h3 id="e131">Lihua Company's Decorated Archway Accidentally Caught Fire Last Night, Did Not Extend to the Interior <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The Lihua Department Store, located at the corner of Nanjing Road and Henan Road, had a decorated archway in front of its main entrance advertising a large-scale sale of pine and cypress trees. Due to prolonged exposure to the sun and night dew, it was unusually dry. At around 7:00 PM last night, the electric lights on the archway, which spelled out "Large Sale," somehow caught fire, causing the fire to spread to the pine and cypress trees. In an instant, the flames soared. Although the company used its own firefighting equipment and made every effort to extinguish the fire, the wind was too strong, and it was like trying to put out a cartload of burning wood with a cup of water. At that time, the traffic on the road was in chaos, and neighboring businesses closed their doors one after another. Soon, someone reported to the Fire Brigade, which dispatched pump trucks to the scene. At the same time, the Electric Light Company cut off the power supply. The decorated archway and flags were completely destroyed. Fortunately, the wind was blowing from south to north, so the interior of Lihua was not affected. Only a portion of the goods, which were hit by the water hose, suffered slight water damage. Traffic on Nanjing Road was stopped for about half an hour.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Chen Yipeizhen Sues for the Return of Her Child <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Husband and wife claim the child, Baobao, is theirs, each side sticks to their own story, mediation fails.</p>
<p>Chen Yipeizhen, a woman from Beiping residing at No. 2, Jiusi Lane, Bushi Road, French Concession, 31 years old, recently appointed lawyer Zhang Ding to file a petition with the Civil Mediation Office of the Second Special District Court, requesting that Chen Zhou, a local woman currently residing at No. 260, Beile Road, 40 years old, be summoned for mediation and the return of her biological son. According to the petition, in 1923, she married Chen Yide, a businessman, as a concubine. Due to his Catholic beliefs, he could not take a concubine, so he rented No. 102, Yongfu Lane, Edouard Road, and lived with Chen for several years. On July 21, 1926, at 6:35 AM, Yipeizhen gave birth to a son, nicknamed Xiong Guan, academically named Nengyi. In May 1927, Yipeizhen became ill and could not raise the child, so she handed Xiong Guan over to Chen De, who died soon after. The family was embroiled in a property dispute, and the claimant's child was used to preserve the family property. Nengyi is now growing older, and the claimant misses her son dearly and intends to take him back for her own upbringing and education. Therefore, she filed a petition requesting mediation and that Nengyi be returned to the claimant for upbringing. The court granted the request and yesterday morning at 2:00 AM, Judge Li Yishu convened the seventh civil court to gather the two parties for mediation. Both parties were represented by lawyers. First, the claimant's lawyer stated the intention of the request for mediation and presented three photos of the claimant with Chen Yide and the child Nengyi. The opposing party's lawyer, representing Chen Zhou, completely denied the claimant's lawyer's claims, stating that although the photos presented by the claimant's side were taken with Chen Yide, they could not be used as conclusive evidence, because taking photos together does not prove a biological relationship. The claimant's lawyer further stated that the claimant's birth of Nengyi could be proven by an obstetrician. At this point, the court considered that the two parties' statements were contradictory and mediation was impossible. Therefore, they declared that mediation had failed and instructed the claimant to file a formal lawsuit separately. The court adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Informant Li Zhucheng Plants Red Pills to Take Revenge, Mastermind Li Kuifu Frames Someone, Fortunately, a Guard from the Airfield Testifies <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>On the morning of the first of this month, Geng Shoubao, the leader of the detective squad stationed at the Caojiadu Public Security Branch in western Shanghai, received a report from informant Li Zhucheng (34 years old, from Henan) stating that a Wang family in a bungalow near the Hongqiao Road airfield in western Shanghai had a large-scale organization selling red pill drugs, using trucks to secretly transport the red pills in fuel tanks, so their business was quite prosperous. If the report was false, he was willing to be punished according to the law. Squad leader Geng reported to Director Wang for approval, and in the evening, he led the entire detective team, along with the informant and patrol police, to the Hongqiao Road police station and went to the address pointed out by the informant. After searching the premises, they found nothing. The head of the household, Wang Bende, was a driver in the guard camp stationed at the airfield. He knew he had been framed and was explaining to Squad Leader Geng when the informant suddenly claimed to have found a package of red pills and showed it to everyone. At that time, the airfield guards who had heard the news rushed to the scene to testify that Wang's business was legitimate and confirmed that the informant was planting evidence to frame him. Wang Bende also stated that he had known the informant Li Zhucheng for a long time and had a grudge against him. They were all taken back to the Caojiadu Branch. According to Li's confession, the mastermind was Li Kuifu, who was currently working as a gatekeeper at a public school on Xinzha Road. Because he had a feud with Wang, he instructed Li to frame him. Personnel were dispatched to arrest Li Kuifu, but he could not be found. The case was then transferred to the Public Security Bureau for investigation. Before the other day, Squad Leader Geng led the detectives and secretly went to the school and arrested Li Kuifu. According to Li's confession, he was 45 years old, from Anhui, and worked as a gatekeeper at the public school on Xinzha Road. He had a wife and a son and a daughter. He, Wang Bende, and Li Zhucheng were all acquaintances. Because he had a deep feud with Wang, he instructed Li to plant evidence to frame him in order to get revenge. The reason was that Wang had invested 300 yuan in a car with the people last year, but he was swallowed and profited alone. Not only was the investment not returned, but he had also repeatedly sneaked into his house this year and seduced and slept with his wife. He was caught and severely rebuked to avoid publicity, but it was still ineffective, so he held a grudge in his heart and discussed a plan with Li Zhucheng. He instructed Li to prepare red pills and secretly hide them in Wang's fuel tank two days before going to Wang's house, and then sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau to report it. He reported to the bureau that it was true. Because the case involved planting evidence to frame someone with a grudge, a document was prepared yesterday and sent to the bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Two Fingers Chopped Off, Qiu Yushi Seems to Have a Mental Illness, Yuan Laosan's Testimony Cannot Be Relied On <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>At around 8:00 PM the night before last, Qiu Yushi, a Shandong native residing at No. 478, Bei Hutang Road, Pudong, accompanied by witness Yuan Laosan, reported to the Machine Gun Team Headquarters of the Lujiazui Municipal Public Security Bureau that at around 6:00 PM that evening, the plaintiff went to the Taitongxin Rice Shop at No. 394, Bei Hutang Road, to buy 200 wen of rice. Because the shop assistant gave him too little rice, he reached out to grab a handful of rice. The shop assistant, Yang Hongkui, threatened to chop off his fingers. He was furious and asked if he had a knife. Yang then took out a kitchen knife, which he took and chopped off his left middle finger and ring finger himself. While speaking, he presented two fingers and requested an investigation. According to witness Yuan, he saw the shop assistant, Zhao Zhihui, holding a long knife and forcibly chopping off the plaintiff's two fingers. The team leader immediately sent police to take both defendants to the team and transferred them to the Pudong Branch. Director Zhang interrogated the plaintiff and witness separately, but their statements were different and contradictory. He then questioned the two defendants, who insisted that the plaintiff had not come to the shop to buy rice or have his fingers chopped off. Director Zhang found many suspicious points in the plaintiff's accusation and went to the shop to investigate. He saw that there were no knife marks or bloodstains on the counter or the ground. According to passersby, the plaintiff had a mental illness that came and went, and sometimes he would even cut his own ears with a knife, but fortunately, it was taken away. The director suspected that the witness was using the plaintiff's chopped-off fingers to defraud someone, so he transferred both parties to the General Bureau for investigation yesterday. However, when they arrived at Dongmen Road in Puxi, the witness Yuan Laosan ordered the plaintiff to insist that the defendant Zhao Zhihui was the one who committed the crime. This was overheard by the escorting police, who reported it to Director Zhang, who was even more convinced that the witness was deliberately making trouble. Therefore, he prepared a second document reporting the mid-way instigation to the bureau for review.</p>

<p>According to the Japanese-language Shanghai Daily, Nakamura Sueko, a beautiful Japanese woman who was once the wife of a pirate in the South Sea, has been based in Fuqing County, Fujian Province, since May of last year. She is a huge pirate who emerges at sea to rob passing ships for a living. Since falling in love with Chen Bailin, a Taiwanese, she has been admired by the bandits and has led her gang to rampage at sea. Later, she won Chen's favor, and all the items robbed from the ships were distributed at her discretion. In the autumn of last year, she suddenly missed her hometown, so she obtained 35,000 yuan in cash from the bandit leader and returned to Japan alone. Passing through Hong Kong and Taiwan, she secretly returned to her hometown of Hokkaido. Unexpectedly, after returning to her hometown, she was strongly denounced by the villagers and could not find a place to live. She had no choice but to return to Fujian and resume her life as a thief. However, at this time, the bandit leader had been killed by the army, and his gang had fled east and west, leaving only three or four confidants. Moreover, the Fujian provincial authorities were investigating very strictly, so she sneaked into the dark streets of Xiamen. When the bandits heard that Sueko had arrived, they gathered the remnants of the gang and planned to make a comeback. It is reported that a powerful naval team has now been formed, with her as the pirate king, engaged in robbery.</p>

<p>Xu Jinqing, former judicial police chief of the Shanghai Local Court, was previously prosecuted by Prosecutor Lei Binzhang for illegally possessing a handgun. As Xu repeatedly failed to appear in court, the case remained unresolved. Recently, Xu Jinqing, after returning to Shanghai from Zhenjiang, hired lawyer Sha Xunyi to file a petition requesting an expedited hearing. The court, acting on the petition, dispatched Police Chief Zhang Shuping on the 1st of this month at 4 PM to summon and detain Xu pending further investigation. Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, the newly appointed Criminal Court President Cai Dincheng presided over the hearing in the Third Tribunal. The defendant Xu Jinqing was defended by lawyers Sha Xunyi, Jin Yu, and Chen Heting, who appeared in court on his behalf. The judge ordered the detained Xu Jinqing to be brought before the court.</p>
<p>(Question): Age 42, from Wuxi, residing at No. 50 Taian Street, outside the West Gate. (Question): Have you ever committed a crime before? (Answer): No. (Question): Do you have any property, how do you live usually? (Answer): I still have land and businesses in my hometown. (Question): Have you received any education? (Answer): I studied at home since childhood. (Question): Who is in your family? (Answer): My father is deceased, my mother is alive, and I have a wife, a son, and a daughter. I also have brothers in my hometown. (Question): Regarding the handgun seized by the prosecutor at your home on July 8th, 1934, where did it come from? (Answer): It belonged to Gong Guoliang, the district chief of the 4th District of the Zhenjiang Water Police. Gong ordered his orderly Chen Xiangtao to send the gun to my house, instructing me to apply for a gun license on his behalf, with only a warrant from him. (This warrant had already been submitted as evidence.) Because at that time, there was no</p>
<p>official letter or Gong's photo, the procedures were not complete, so I didn't apply for the license yet. I kept the gun in my house to hold it for him. After I received the photo, I would then apply for the license. (Question): When was this gun given to you? (Answer): July 2nd of last year. The warrant and the gun were given to me at the same time, but the date on the warrant was June 30th. (Question): From July 2nd to July 8th, were you at home all the time? (Answer): I waited for three days, and when I didn't see any official letter sent, I left Shanghai on the 6th and went to Zhenjiang 4th District to serve. I was appointed by the Shanxi Police District Chief as a</p>
<p>district consultant. (Question): How many families live in your house? (Answer): Two families. One is the Wang Shuifang family. The Wang family lives downstairs and runs an insurance company. (Question): When the prosecutor searched your house, you asked him to leave, and the Wang family said you went to Hardoon Garden to have fun. (Answer): They were just guessing. I had already left Shanghai. (Question): According to you, someone sent you the gun on June 30th and asked you to get a license. Why hadn't you applied for the license by July 8th when the prosecutor searched your house, which was eight or nine days later? Besides, since it was Gong's gun, your wife should have known. Why didn't she say anything when the prosecutor raised the issue? (Answer): A photo was needed to apply for the license. Because no photo was sent, it was delayed. My wife did</p>
<p>explain to the prosecutor. I am indeed a consultant for the 4th District, and I have an appointment letter to prove it. (Question): When were you appointed? (Answer): I can't remember the date. (Question): Have you ever served in the Zhenjiang District? (Answer): I often resided in the district to serve. Besides, I once led a team to suppress bandits in Taihu Lake. When Gu Zhutong was the chairman of Jiangsu Province, I was the director of the investigation department of the Civil Affairs Department. That's why I haven't been back for a long time. (Question): Since the discovery of the handgun, it's been almost October. Why have you repeatedly failed to appear when summoned? (Answer): Although I sometimes went to Shanghai, because I didn't ask for leave and left overnight, I didn't report to the case. Although District Chief Gong has resigned, I still served in the district after the successor District Chief Wang took over. After I came to Shanghai, I</p>
<p>submitted a petition stating my request to be brought to trial. Because I only requested two weeks of leave. The judge said, "You should have reported earlier, and the case could have been concluded earlier, so you wouldn't have been delayed." (Answer): "I didn't know that your court had repeatedly summoned me. Now I ask the judge to forgive me. If I had lied, how would I dare to submit a petition myself?" (Question): Does District Chief Gong have another office in Shanghai? (Answer): No. Gong's district is the Zhenjiang 4th District. According to Jiangsu Province, there are four major districts. The first district is located in Minhang, Shanghai. The second district is located in Suzhou. The third district is located in Tongzhou. All are appointed by the Civil Affairs Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Government.</p>
<p>At this point, Prosecutor Lei Binzhang came to court and argued that the defendant Xu Jinqing was illegally possessing a handgun. When searched, two gun licenses were found, but the numbers filled in did not match the number on the gun at all. During the investigation, the defendant repeatedly failed to appear, claiming that the handgun was entrusted by District Chief Gong to apply for a license on his behalf. If it was for applying for a license, why were there also three bullets? There was also no official document from the district chief to prove it. Furthermore, this handgun was found in the drawer in front of the bed, which proves that it belongs to the defendant. He should be publicly sentenced according to law. Xu Jinqing said that Gong's warrant was in his briefcase and was not handed over at the time, so there was a misunderstanding. Judge Cai then began the debate. Lawyer Sha Xunyi began by saying that Article 2 of the Regulations on Military Firearms and Artillery stipulates that anyone who possesses firearms and cannot prove that there is a legitimate reason for doing so</p>
<p>constitutes a punishable offense. Conversely, if a person possesses firearms and can prove that there is a legitimate reason for doing so, it is not restricted by the regulations. The meaning is very clear. The legislative intention is not to restrict the people's ability to possess firearms, but to prevent the people from abusing them and affecting public order. In this case, the defendant's reason for possessing the handgun was that he was entrusted by District Chief Gong of the Water Police to apply for a concession license. Furthermore, it was found during the search in a locked drawer and was not placed outside, so there was no possibility of using it at any time.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of his duties and with the written proof from District Chief Gong of the Water Police, it is indeed a fact, and there is obviously no situation where he cannot prove that there is a legitimate reason. It does not seem to fall within the scope of a crime under the legislative intent of Article 2 of the Regulations on Military Firearms and Artillery. According to law, there is no possibility of constituting a crime. He requested that Xu Jinqing be declared innocent. Then, lawyers Jin Yu and Chen Heting stood up one after another to defend him for a long time. The general meaning was the same as what Lawyer Sha said. He requested bail in court.

If calculated from the Shanhaiguan Official School, it will have been 40 years by now. It is the earliest engineering and material specialty school in China. The Shanhaiguan Official School was destroyed by fire during the Boxer Rebellion. Therefore, in the 31st year of Guangxu, the old professors were summoned to build Tangshan Jiaotong University in Tangshan. At first, it was named Tangshan Road and Mining School. The first class graduated in 1912. At that time, 23 people took the exam to become engineers for the Yuehan Road project, and all of them were admitted. (A total of 28 people were admitted, and their reputation spread throughout the national engineering community, thus opening up the reputation of Tangshan for hard work in the engineering community. Later, it was changed to Tangshan Industrial Vocational School. In 1917, the Ministry of Education investigated the performance of vocational schools across the country, and Tangshan was especially known for its first-place performance in the country. Later, a mechanical engineering department was added. Later, it was combined with Nanyang and Beijing schools to form Jiaotong University. Later, the three schools were separated, and Tangshan was called Tangda. After that, it was merged. Tangshan is now called Jiaotong University Tangshan Engineering School. Now a mining department has been added, which is becoming more and more perfect. It is indeed the engineering school with the longest history and the best results in China's construction.</p>

<p>To the Editor: I have just read a news item in the "Local Correspondences" column of your newspaper on the 15th regarding a lawsuit against Kunshan County Magistrate Peng, which does not conform to the facts. After investigation, in the case of Wang Chengjia and Wei Rongting from this county last July, suspected of fraud, Wang Pijia has long failed to appear in court. The county government, in accordance with judicial procedures, presented it to the High Court for approval of an arrest warrant. Subsequently, Wang Pijia petitioned the High Court to transfer jurisdiction of the case, but it was not approved. Wang then appealed to the Supreme Court, which ordered the High Court to re-adjudicate. Now, the High Court has approved the transfer of the entire file to the Wuxian District Court for trial, so that Wang Pijia and Wei Rongting can confront each other. Recently, a ruling was issued ordering the county government to send a police officer to deliver it to Pijia. As for what was stated that County Magistrate Peng had received a summons and gone to Suzhou to await questioning, this is not the case. Please correct this. Thank you very much. Addressed to: Editorial Department of Shen Bao Newspaper, Kunshan County Government, May 16th.</p>

<p>(Central News Agency, Kunming, 16th) On the 15th, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek summoned principals and military training directors of secondary schools and above at the headquarters to give instructions. The key points were: (1) Universities and specialized schools should focus on improving quality, and the Sino-French Gengkuan funds will be used to subsidize Yunnan University. (2) The people of Yunnan are simple and honest. It is hoped that all schools will strictly discipline and train students according to the essence of the New Life Movement. Special attention should be paid to the organization and management of affairs to cultivate their strong administrative abilities. The purpose of education is threefold: to make the best use of people's talents, to make the best use of the land, and to make the best use of resources. To achieve these three goals, one must start by improving students' moral knowledge and physical fitness, that is, by implementing the New Life Movement as a foundation. If students are well-trained at school, they will surely influence others, and when they go to society, they will be able to influence society. Like the wind bending the grass, the effects will be great. (3) Military training is the foundation for teaching students how to be people, to cultivate them into citizens with the five virtues of wisdom, trust, benevolence, courage, and strictness, that is, to cultivate their lives to be militarized. It is hoped that this spirit will be used to intensify training.</p>

<p>The Municipal Health and Education Bureaus, in order to announce the regulations of the Shanghai Children's Holiday Health Activities Promotion Association, jointly issued a public notice yesterday, stating that the health of children's bodies and minds depends on appropriate care. Governments of various countries and civil groups often use holidays to hold various children's health activities, and want to use the opportunity of children's summer vacations to give them opportunities to exercise their bodies and minds. The bureau, etc., in view of this, have also initiated and promoted such activities, such as last year's Children's Summer Health Camp, which is one example. Although the matter is an innovation, the results are not without promise.

Special notice is hereby given. The regulations of the Shanghai Children's Holiday Health Activities Promotion Association are attached as follows:</p>

<p>The All-Soviet Games held by Wuxian Daily yesterday (16th) was the second day. The weather was sunny and clear, and the atmosphere was even more lively than the first day. However, the results were not very outstanding. Cheng Jinguan's 200 meters was 24.5 seconds, which was barely satisfactory, but the headwind was a slight disadvantage. Gu Huo's high jump result was 1.65 meters, which was disappointing. Jin Zhongkang's 10,000 meters took the lead from the start and finished consistently, with the last person lagging behind by six or seven laps. It was a wonderful performance in the Games. The result was 37 minutes 2 seconds 5. The results of each event are listed on the right. The chief referee of the Games was Wu Bangwei, the sports supervisor of the Education Department, so there were no disputes in the eight groups for men and women, with 38 events. It left a very good impression on the history of Suzhou sports.</p>

<h3 id="e186">The Mutual Influence of Literature Among Countries <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Ji Cong</p>
<p>In the process of literary development, especially in modern literature, we can often see the mutual influence of literature among countries. What is the reason for this? We believe that the emergence or transplantation of a certain type of literature into a certain society is due to the certain needs of that society. If the literature of countries A and B have mutual influence in some areas, it also occurs under certain similar or identical social needs. However, the existence of similar social needs between countries A and B also has its actual basis; this basis lies in the fact that their social relationships have some kind of similarity. Only with this kind of similar social relationship can similar needs arise, and thus mutual influence can occur in literature as well. The so-called mutual influence of national literature does not occur unconditionally or without basis. George once said: "The influence of one country's literature on another is directly proportional to the similarity of the social relations between the two countries. Without this similarity, influence will not occur at all." In fact, although Europeans have long arrived in Africa, African blacks have not yet been influenced by European literature. The nomadic people in the Locke area at the junction of Sichuan, Gansu, Qinghai, and Kangding, although we have known about them for a long time, have not yet received the influence of our literature. Terms like Romanticism, Realism, and Neo-Realism are meaningless to their nomadic lives. ...These facts fully demonstrate that if there are no similar social relations, even if two countries or two kinds of people have communication, mutual influence in literature will not occur.</p>
<p>In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, for fifty or sixty years, the literary trend of Romanticism swept across Europe. Generally speaking, this literary trend first prevailed in England, and then blossomed in Germany and France. But in the entire Romantic movement, the three countries—England, Germany, and France—did have mutual influence. Although the surge of Romanticism in France occurred after England and Germany, Rousseau's advocacy of "returning to nature" had already laid a theoretical foundation for the entire Romantic movement. The successful performance of Hugo's "Hernani" not only demonstrated the victory of French Romanticism over Classicism, but also demonstrated the victory of Romanticism in Europe, and its influence spread throughout Europe. Similarly, Goethe in Germany and the so-called "Sturm und Drang" movement in Germany also had a great influence on the literature of England and France at that time. From this we can say that in the great tide of Romanticism, the literature of England, Germany, and France did have mutual influence. Needless to say, the occurrence of this mutual influence was also due to the similarity of social relations in England, Germany, and France. First of all, in the second half of the 18th century, England gradually embarked on an industrial capitalist society, and then Germany and France also transformed into countries with such social forms. The new emerging citizens, the masters of this industrial capitalist society, in order to pave the way for building their own literature, had to break the existing literary rules and negate Classicism. Thus, in the three countries—England, Germany, and France—which successively embarked on the road of industrial capitalist society, the literary trend of Romanticism occurred one after another. However, because the emerging industrial citizens were still young at that time and did not yet fully have the ability to dominate the new society, and even more lacked sufficient experience and cultivation in literature, they could not clearly express their independent social consciousness in literature. At the same time, the aristocracy was already declining, and of course did not have a positive upward consciousness, and even less could they express their dominating spirit in literature. Therefore, the Romanticism that appeared at this time, whether in England, Germany, or France, showed both aristocratic and mixed forms. This is clear evidence that the social relations of England, Germany, and France at that time had many similarities. Due to this similarity, the literature of England, Germany, and France had mutual influence at that time, and a surge of Romanticism occurred in their societies. Although the Romanticism that appeared in England, Germany, and France at that time also had its own differences, generally speaking, they were similar. The actual root of this similarity, of course, exists in their similar social relations.</p>
<p>If we shift the issue to China, it becomes even clearer. As everyone knows, since the imperialists used cannons to bombard open the flourishing gates of China in 1840, especially after the May Fourth New Culture Movement, the influence of Western European literature on Chinese literature has become an undeniable fact. Ibsen's individualism was greatly praised in China during the May Fourth era. The literary trends of Romanticism and Naturalism also exchanged in China after the 1990s. Subsequently, trends like Neo-Realism and Neo-Romanticism were also brought to China. In just a few decades, backward China almost transplanted all the literary phenomena that had gone through centuries in Europe. As a result, those nativists felt very uneasy, believing that Chinese literature following foreign literature was entirely created by a dozen or so writers who loved "foreign goods" and novelty. In order to preserve the national essence, they desperately opposed the influence of foreign literature on Chinese literature. In fact, the influence of Western European and even Japanese literature on Chinese literature was not created out of thin air by a small number of people who loved "foreign goods" and novelty, but was due to the many similarities between Chinese social relations and those of Western Europe and even Japan. Only when there was the existence of a bourgeoisie in China could bourgeois literature from Western Europe and Japan be transmitted to China; otherwise, even if Westerners and Japanese people entered the Chinese mainland, their bourgeois literature would not be accepted by China. Taking the May Fourth Literary Revolution as an example, many literary researchers believe that this revolution occurred entirely under the influence of foreign literature; even those who are more progressive regard the influence of foreign literature as one of the main reasons for the occurrence of the literary revolution. It is true that the May Fourth Literary Revolution was indeed greatly influenced by foreign literature, but this influence was not the fundamental reason for the revolution. On the contrary, it was because Chinese society had developed to the May Fourth era that it became necessary and possible to have such a literary revolution. On this necessity and possibility, on the needs of that kind of literary revolution, Western European literature then gave a strong influence to Chinese literature. More specifically, it was that Chinese social relations at that time had similarities with Western European social relations. Under the internal needs of Chinese society, Western European literature then influenced Chinese literature and caused the May Fourth Literary Revolution. Without this similarity, Western European literature would not have given such a great influence to Chinese literature, and thus it would not have had much to do with the Chinese Literary Revolution. Mr. Zhou Zuoren once made a clever explanation of the issue of Western European literature influencing the May Fourth Literary Revolution in his "The Origin and Development of New Chinese Literature": "Everything is ready, only the east wind is lacking"; then he said that the "east wind" here should be changed to "west wind." This means that the occurrence of the May Fourth Literary Revolution was because Chinese society had already possessed the conditions for the occurrence of this revolution, so it followed Western European society and accepted its literary trends, triggering a literary revolution. The so-called influence of Western European literature on Chinese literature at that time was not the fundamental reason for the occurrence of the May Fourth Literary Revolution, but only an external driving force of that revolution. Moreover, this driving force was attracted by the internal needs of Chinese society, due to the similarity between the social relations of China at that time and those of Western Europe.</p>
<p>So, why did Chinese literature in the May Fourth era not influence Western European literature, but only be influenced by Western European literature? Our answer is: Chinese society and culture were more backward than those of Western Europe. Modern society and its culture occurred latest in China. All the literary phenomena produced by Chinese society were not worth taking by the advanced Western European countries. On the contrary, the existing literature of the advanced Western European countries was urgently needed by backward China. Therefore, although Chinese social relations in the May Fourth era had some similarities with those of Western Europe, in fact, only Chinese literature followed Western European literature, only Chinese literature was influenced by Western European literature, and Chinese literature did not influence Western European literature.</p>
<p>From the above practical investigation, it can be seen that the issue of mutual influence of literature among countries occurs under similar social relations. At the same time, in countries with somewhat similar social relations, if one is more backward and the other is more advanced, then the literary influence is one-sided: that is, the more advanced influences the more backward. Currently, many people in China often angrily say: Chinese literature only follows Japan, and Japanese literature only follows Western European countries. This is unacceptable! Little do they know that this situation also has its actual social roots. Whether you like it or not, as long as these actual social roots exist, the literary phenomena produced by them will always exist and develop.</p>
<h3 id="e187">The Disappearance of Honoré Shoubrak (1) <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Written by G. Apollinaire of France Translated by Xiao Lin</p>
<p>Although the police conducted a very detailed investigation into the disappearance of Honoré Shoubrak, the incredible truth about this incident could not be ascertained, and so it was dealt with perfunctorily.</p>
<p>Honoré Shoubrak was my friend, and I also knew the whole story of this incident very well, so I believed that reporting the truth of this matter to the authorities was my duty. But after the judge finished listening to my statement, he actually questioned me with an extraordinary gentle tone. Therefore, I knew that this judge actually regarded me as a madman. I pointed this out to the judge. But by doing so, he became even more gentle. And before long, he suddenly stood up and quickly pushed me towards the door. Even the clerk who had just been copying my statement also stood up arrogantly, clenching his fists as if I would suddenly pounce on him if I went crazy, posing in such a fierce manner.</p>
<p>After this, I no longer insisted on saying anything. In short, the disappearance of Honoré Shoubrak was indeed too bizarre, resulting in the truth resembling a groundless fabrication. Shoubrak was originally a strange character, as reported in the news articles at the time of his disappearance. No matter the time, regardless of winter or summer, he was always naked except for a monk's robe, and on his equally bare feet, he wore a pair of slippers. Knowing that he was very wealthy, I found this unbelievable and had asked him why he dressed so indecently in public. His reply at the time was like this:</p>
<p>— This is in preparation for being able to quickly transform into a nude state when necessary. As for wearing thin clothing outdoors, the human body can easily get used to it. I have abolished all clothing articles such as trousers, shirts, hats, and socks. I have been living like this since I was twenty-five years old and have not even been sick once.</p>
<p>However, these words not only did not explain my doubts in the slightest, but instead pricked up my curiosity.</p>
<p>— What does this mean after all? Why does Honoré Shoubrak need to quickly undress and return to a nude state?</p>
<p>I had to think this way.</p>
<p>One late night, when I was returning home—around one or one fifteen in the morning—I heard someone softly calling my name; and the voice seemed to be coming from the wall I had brushed past. I was startled and unconsciously stopped. The voice then continued:</p>
<p>— Can't you see anyone on the street? It's me, Honoré Shoubrak.</p>
<p>I opened my eyes and looked around, but I couldn't find my friend's shadow there.</p>
<p>— Where exactly are you? I said.</p>
<p>At this moment, I saw the familiar monk's robe and the pair of slippers on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>— This must be a situation where Honoré Shoubrak had to quickly undress due to some necessity. This time, I must grasp the key to his secret. Thinking this, I shouted:</p>
<p>— There's no one on the street. My friend, come out.</p>
<p>Honoré Shoubrak suddenly appeared naked from the wall I couldn't see anything just now. He quickly put on the monk's robe from over his head, hurriedly buttoned it up, and then put on the pair of slippers. With a resolute expression, he walked straight towards my door with me, walking side by side while speaking.</p>

<p>— Ding</p>
<p>It has only been a short two years since Jane became a nun. Yet everything has changed so quickly.</p>
<p>Wasn't Jane a robust, lively, beautiful, and capable woman when she was still studying at the provincial high school the year before last?</p>
<p>At that time, Jane was not only talkative, liked to read, and willing to work, but also liked to exercise.</p>
<p>She was truly optimistic about life. Therefore, she held a strong pursuit and lofty ideals for everything in the future. How lovely and glorious Jane was.</p>
<p>I remember—that was on the evening when we were about to part ways, Jane stood in the center of the student union's podium and spoke to us sternly, resolutely, cautiously, and seemingly as a farewell message: "We are considered to have graduated. After this, there will be very few opportunities for everyone to gather together, talk, and work together. Therefore, at this time, while we have not yet dispersed, I want to sincerely talk to everyone. I feel that our task will be even more arduous after this. After leaving the school gate and stepping into society, everything will not be the same as in school. We must understand what a terrible situation China—especially our women—is currently in. We seem to be living inhuman lives. Everything makes us feel heartbroken and resentful! Therefore, as women of the new era, we should take on a great mission! We must fight against the adverse environment surrounding us. We cannot be like ordinary "modern" women who only indulge in rosy lives and that kind of despicable behavior that specializes in catering to male psychology. We should bring out the spirit of the new century—self-respect, independence, progress, and struggle—and go ahead with our consistent purpose. At the very least, among our millions of female compatriots, we must lead them, awaken them, and open up a path for our miserable fate! This is my last conversation with all of you. In the future, if there is an opportunity, I hope that everyone can supervise each other, be diligent, help each other, and often instruct me!"</p>
<p>However, after only a short two years of separation, Jane's change is so sudden and rapid.</p>
<p>Since then, Jane has only been sitting dully at home in silence all day long, not going out, not doing things, not reading books, and even being too lazy to speak. All day long, she is either dozing or playing cards. If she is not playing cards, she quietly sits alone in a daze by the south-facing window, gazing dreamily at the azure sky and the bright moon. Her heart is melancholy, like the autumn season.</p>
<p>"How is this kind of life passing by in depression!" she muttered. Then she sighed deeply and looked out the window again. The azure sky was full of twinkling stars, and the earth was still lying in the deathly silence of the moonlight. And in the shadow of the thatched cottage vaguely in this deathly moonlight, as well as the desolate and mournful coughs, made Jane even more distressed. At this time, a hot, painful, and seemingly sun-scorched stone-like thought surged in her mind. Faced with this thought, Jane could not use an appropriate, coherent, and clear sentence to explain it.</p>
<p>"Oh, forget it. Look, look!" Jane muttered to herself, "How beautiful, noble, lovely, and glorious this moon is." Then, a difficult joy appeared on Jane's face. And this joy, if you carefully taste the ingredients inside, you will find that it is such a bitter joy.</p>
<p>Perhaps, it can be said that this voice is a passion reversed from Jane's vitality. This voice may be an understanding of the beauty of nature and love experienced from Jane's long-term immersion in a life of suffering. In short, Jane has changed now, everything has changed, consciously and physically.</p>
<p>In the past, those noble, proud, and glorious qualities have quietly slipped away from Jane's life.</p>
<p>Now Jane is so lonely and depressed, staying in a daze like an idiot in a dark house, gazing at the lonely sky and the lonely summer moon. Only in such a blue night does Jane feel how melancholy the heart of a lonely person is.</p>
<p>"Life is so boring!" Then a sentimental tear wet her clothes. "Oh, I really regret leaving school! Why didn't I go on to university? Why did I marry such an ugly old man? Am I crazy? Have I lost all my sanity? Oh, why? Money? Fame? Enjoyment? What a cursed thing this is! Isn't this weak and greedy old man a person I often despise? Isn't he the kind of guy who relies on his strong financial power to seduce, oppress, play with, and trample on us women? Huh, huh! How could I marry him!..." With a condemning tone, Jane questioned herself so indignantly.</p>
<p>However, everything seemed irreparable. Since her father's business failed, Jane had no possibility of continuing her studies due to the family's financial constraints. Since then, Jane's life has undergone many changes. But in the end, finally under her father's stern threats and her mother's bitter pleas, Jane inexplicably agreed and succumbed. She married a man who had once been cited by Jane as a point of attack, a playboy who relied on his ancestors' inheritance to live a degenerate life.</p>
<p>But—"That's so strange?" Jane said, "Are my eyes blind too? This is clearly an ugly fat merchant! Oh, I was deceived, I was fooled. Everything—is over! I... I am sacrificed under a social system that worships money and honor..."</p>
<p>Jane then sobbed convulsively.</p>
<p>After enduring such a miserable life for only two years, Jane seemed like a dying person, or like a pair of broken shoes, thrown into some corner.</p>
<p>From the cold world, she gained a contempt of regret; from hypocritical exchanges, she felt a heartbreaking pain; from the arrogant, she received an unbearable cold shoulder; from her past classmates, she was ashamed of the disgrace of her life! From the old man, she sensed a capitalist's rancid and savage smell.</p>
<p>"No! No! I absolutely cannot go on like this," Jane finally shouted involuntarily.</p>

<h3 id="e190">Gold Market in July Starts with Bullish Sales; Bad News Causes Prices to Fall Below 60 Yuan; After Deducting Swap Fees, Prices Plummet by 13.7 Yuan <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday marked the start of the July gold market, and the market was agitated by unfavorable news and rising prices in foreign silver markets, leading to a surge in selling. Prices even broke through the 60 yuan mark. Later, the exchange rate stabilized, and major players actively purchased, leading to a slight recovery. Early in the morning, overseas silver markets rose uniformly, and the forward silver price in Montelibano also increased by 1.69 to 2.2%. The exchange rate rose slightly, and the price of raw gold in London rose by half a penny. The market was sluggish, and pre-market trading opened and retreated to 66-67 yuan, but selling remained strong, falling to 62-63 yuan before stabilizing somewhat. After the opening, the Central Bank announced its exchange rates, with the British pound unchanged against the US dollar, rising by 0.0625, and the Customs Gold Unit rising by 0.1%. The standard gold price was 826.1 yuan, attracting many buyers and causing prices to rise. However, the exchange rate was not optimistic, and as prices rose, abundant supply led to a sudden surge in selling, pushing prices down to near the 60 yuan mark. HSBC Bank tried to buy first to preempt the market, knowing that HSBC's exchange rates would be unchanged for both British pounds and US dollars. After falling, the market quickly recovered. Sassoon and others sold, and major players continued to sell, temporarily halting the price increase. However, there was still support after the fall. Later, although the exchange rate tightened slightly, causing a temporary price increase, a Reuters report rumored that although President Roosevelt had rejected the proposal to issue 200 million yuan in unbacked paper money to pay for veteran benefits, the Vice President had a different opinion and might approve the plan. This news caused the market to lose confidence and triggered selling, causing prices to fall below the 60 yuan mark, showing a weak state. The after-market opened flat and weak. The initial Indian silver price rose by 7 annas, and the spot price also rose. Banks actively bought, and the exchange rate tightened slightly, leading to a rebound. However, due to a private telegram reporting that the US government was continuing to buy silver abroad, selling increased slightly, causing prices to fall briefly. However, banks had healthy appetites, and major players continued to buy aggressively. Even with Dalian speculators covering their positions, the market remained dry, and prices gradually rose. The second Indian silver price rose slightly by 2 annas, and the spot price was flat. There were rumors of misunderstandings, with prices initially rising and then falling. The final market situation was stable, and after the close, Yicheng continued to buy aggressively, causing prices to rise slightly. Swap rates had already passed for the day, and the market was lively, with demand increasing and swap rates rising to over 4 yuan. Below is a record of the day's market conditions:</p>

Reuters reported that the US market was rumored that the Vice President might have the hope of overturning President Roosevelt's rejection of the 200 million yuan veteran benefit bill, causing market sentiment to weaken. Chunyuan, Yonghengyu, Fuxingyong, Huixiang, Yongli, Fuyu, Yuanmaoyong, Dada, and Yicheng jointly sold bullion, breaking the 60 yuan mark and falling to 56.5 yuan.

The morning session was flat. Later, banks traded with each other, and the situation loosened slightly. HSBC Bank's exchange rates were unchanged for both British pounds and US dollars. Although HSBC struggled to close, it was difficult to tighten the market due to Sassoon's slight sales. Later, banks successively sold. A Reuters telegram stated that the US Vice President might approve President Roosevelt's rejected plan to issue 200 million yuan in unbacked paper money, causing market sentiment to weaken and the process to harden. The after-market opened flat, and banks actively closed, tightening slightly. Indian silver rose by 7 annas, and there were more bids. Later, Chinese merchants worked hard to supply, and a private telegram reported that the US government was continuing to buy silver abroad, causing prices to flatten.

<p>The situation in the foreign market has remained sluggish as before. Due to limitations in their strength, most firms are taking a wait-and-see approach. Therefore, the atmosphere in the market is depressed. Without relief funds, the practice of interbank lending will not develop. Yesterday's interbank rate remained at 1.1% in the morning and afternoon. The water rate for water rate was also unchanged throughout the day, the same as the previous day. The transaction volume of the day for bills was 3.4 million in the morning, and 300k new transactions,  and 500,000 in the afternoon. The transaction volume in the Junior Association was 700,000. The amount of foreign collateral taken in was 700,000, and the new volume was 600,000. 600,000 worth of banknotes were redeemed, and 400,000 worth of circulating notes, 700,000 worth of marked notes, 600,000 worth of remittances from various places, and 200,000 worth of funds from other regions were issued, and 150,000 was taken away.

<h3 id="e193">Securities: A Slight Rebound in 96 in the Afternoon <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Huashang Securities Exchange was still experiencing strong turmoil due to the 96 crisis. There were various rumors about the settlement procedures for old shares in the market, but there was no definite solution, and most people were skeptical. However, after the 96's continuous decline for many days, there was a slight rebound after the opening in the afternoon, and the distant-term closing suddenly reversed by a small amount, causing the future market to be backward, causing panic among the long positions. The large drop and small rebound were slightly related to covering short positions. The crazy selling of No. 53 and others at the close was not optimistic, and there will still be a major crisis outside the 20th. Although other bonds saw a slight rebound, the financial sector received a huge amount of disaster relief bonds, and other varieties were gradually squeezed out, so the future trend is still more likely to be weak. Yesterday's process was tight in the morning after a weak opening, with 96 continuing to fall by a small amount by 0.15. The second round was mostly firm, with 96 falling by another 0.1. After the opening in the afternoon, the prices continued to strengthen by 0.1 and 0.2, but there were no major purchases. The current month opened at 7.35 yuan and was raised to 60 cents to close, while the distant-term rose to 0.9 yuan, and the closing was peaceful. Although the current month 96 rose by 0.35, there were huge sell orders for the distant-term No. 4 and No. 53, falling by 0.05. The near and distant-term market prices reversed, which is a sign of instability in the market. Overall, the market price results were as follows: except for a slight decrease of 0.1 for the current month of 20 Cotton, the rest all rebounded by 0.05, 0.1 to 0.3. 96 also rebounded by 0.25, and the distant-term was only good for 0.05. The total transaction volume was 11,881,000 yuan, of which 96 still accounted for 6,735,000 yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Bank reported that yesterday (the 15th), the New York stock market turned firm, and railroad stocks were particularly strong. Oak Road's freight report showed an increase, and it was widely expected that the government would soon take action to support the various routes. American Telephone and Telegraph rose because the company continued to issue dividends. Small exchange stocks initially showed mixed results, but later also turned firm. The bond market rose slightly, and US government bonds were quiet. The total transaction volume for the day was 1.05 million shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left:</p>

<h3 id="e195">Yarn Flower: Speculation in Yarn Faces Bearish Sentiment <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>There are rumors of good sales this month focusing on the Triangle brand.</p>
<p>The yarn market is calm and the situation feels weary. Poor surrounding circumstances and a sharp rise in overseas silver prices have led some to anticipate a downturn. However, a major player with long positions remains remarkably calm, preparing to take delivery of near-term contracts this month. Despite the unfavorable atmosphere, the cloth market has not been significantly impacted. For this month's deliveries, there are 500 bales of 20-count Lion brand yarn, reportedly already deposited in the intermediary warehouse.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Weariness</p>
<p>The opening of the speculative yarn market saw a generally bearish sentiment due to the continued rise in overseas silver markets and the fall in gold prices. Trading was sparse as a result. However, strong buying pressure from major long position holders, coupled with rumors of deliveries, prevented market prices from falling despite the negative atmosphere. As a result, near-term contracts rose by 1.23 jiao (a fraction of a yuan) compared to the previous day's close, while far-term contracts remained unchanged. The market weakened suddenly in the afternoon, with a slight increase in selling pressure after the gold price broke through the 60 yuan barrier. However, supply remained scarce and panic did not break out. Ultimately, prices for all months fell by 1.23 to 5 jiao compared to the morning's close. Trading was very quiet. It was observed that Yuda sold 450 bales, Ruida 800 bales, Shenyu 300 bales, Dachangcheng 600 bales, Changfeng 1150 bales, and Xiacheng 300 bales. Dafu bought 850 bales, Dafeng 400 bales, Junchang 950 bales, Xiacheng 600 bales, and Yichang 300 bales. The daily high, low, and closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Steady Actual Sales</p>
<p>Actual yarn sales remain good. A total of 1205 bales of standard yarn were purchased by various guilds throughout the day. Market conditions were similar to the previous day. The purchase volume of each guild is as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong 105, Changsha 5, Inland 45</p>
<p>Shantou 100, Xiamen 5, Nanjing 5</p>
<p>Speculative Flower Weakness Persists as Before</p>
<p>The cotton market appears weak daily, due to continuous silver price increases and falling gold prices. The American and Indian cotton markets are not rising in tandem with silver prices, causing foreign cotton valuations to decline daily. However, a major cotton merchant in Shanghai is holding onto long positions tightly, refusing to yield. Therefore, despite the adverse news, the market is still able to hold steady. However, current cotton consumption is largely quiet.</p>
<p>Zheng Speculative Sentiment Softens</p>
<p>Before the opening of the speculative cotton market, it was widely anticipated that prices might decline by several jiao due to the rampant rise of silver prices, the fall in gold prices, and the limited gains in American and Indian cotton markets. Contrary to expectations, major long position holders remained unmoved at the opening. Although market sentiment was generally bearish, the lack of supply prevented prices from falling, and levels remained steady for all months. Some floating profits were taken on second and third positions, resulting in a slight leveling. Ultimately, prices for all months fell by 5 fen (a fraction of a jiao) compared to the previous day's close. News of gold prices breaking through the 60 yuan barrier in the afternoon caused some panic at the opening, but selling pressure did not surge, and prices fell by only 1 jiao. Second and third positions remained unchanged. Ultimately, prices for all months fell by 5 fen compared to the morning's close. It was observed that Dafu sold 900 dan (a unit of weight), Hexing 1200 dan, Changfeng 700 dan, Runkang 2100 dan, Chong'an 1000 dan, Yichang 800 dan, and Yikang 1100 dan. Jifeng bought 800 dan, Dafeng 1700 dan, Shengyuan 700 dan, Tonghe 800 dan, Yuanda 900 dan, Yuanyi 1500 dan, and Yuanxingchang 1000 dan. The daily high, low, and closing prices are as follows:</p>

<p>Factory Demand Sluggish with No Progress</p>
<p>Current cotton consumption is exceptionally sluggish, with factory demand quiet. The source is estimated at 500 bales, Tongzhou cotton 350 bales.</p>
<p>Shashi Cotton 42.50, Shenxin Purchases 105 pieces, Spot delivery to the factory</p>
<p>Hankou Fine Velvet 43.75, Zhentai Factory Purchases 200 pieces, Spot delivery to the factory</p>
<p>May American Cotton Delivery Only 500 Bales</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened firm but lacked activity. Prices for all months rose by 1 to 3 points. Market conditions saw professionals buying near-term contracts and foreign firms selling far-term contracts. The May contract, however, experienced a reaction due to a delivery notice of only 900 bales. Later, selling decreased and market conditions improved. However, buyers are also quite timid at the current market prices. Most transactions involved selling July and shifting to far-term contracts. Finally, the government made some purchases, and professionals and short-sellers also bought, resulting in a firm close. Weather conditions and consumption indices had little influence. Spot prices rose by 5 points, and futures prices rose by 3 to 6 points for all months except May, which rose by 12 points. British cotton spot prices rose by 2 points, and futures prices rose by 1 to 3 points. Indian cotton initially firmed due to public buying, but later retreated due to selling by European exporters and Japanese firms. The price for Pingguo rose by 1 to 1.25 rupees, Aomula fell by 0.25 rupees, Bairoxi rose by 0.25 to 1 rupee. Original telegram on the left (dated 13th).</p>

<p>Flour prices fluctuated yesterday, initially rising before falling. The price of foreign wheat from Chicago improved by 8 fen to 1 jiao, while Canadian wheat remained unchanged. Prices were slightly better for foreign wheat at the opening, which gave people confidence in the market's stability. Early-month prices were similar to the previous day. Afterward, prices gradually increased as speculators made some transactions, with the closing price reaching 5 jiao 2 fen 7 li and a half. Prices for June and July also rose slightly due to sluggish trading, increasing by 1 fen. Prices for September and October remained stable with little fluctuation. However, prices fell sharply in the afternoon's opening, with near-term contracts declining across the board. With the arrival of new wheat approaching this month, demand from inland buyers, except those in the north, was weak, leading to speculation that the price of foreign wheat would fall further, with Australian wheat quoted at 6 jiao 2 fen. There were also rumors that inland factories had already made an order for a ship, which dampened market sentiment, and prices fell step by step. Considering the cheap price of foreign wheat, factories are likely to place orders one after another, making it difficult to be overly optimistic about the future of the flour market. As a result, the price for this month fell by 1 fen 7 li and a half, June fell by 1 fen 7 li and a half, July fell by 1 fen, August fell by half a fen, September fell by 7 li and a half, and October fell by 1 fen 2 li and a half.</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market was calm in the morning but fell sharply in the afternoon. Chicago's foreign wheat prices were slightly better by 8 fen to 1 jiao, while Canadian wheat was suspended. Trading was not active at the opening, with prices fluctuating due to a lack of sellers, showing little change from the previous day. The market initially appeared stable in the afternoon opening, but the powder market declined because it was reported that Australian wheat was cheaper than ever. Though no deal was certain at 4.6 jiao or 4.6 jiao, 1 fen, it shocked the market because of rumors of the new wheat to be harvested next time and the imports of wheat were as cheap. There are many changes in the future. As a result, the price of July fell by six fen, the price of August fell by six fen, the price of September fell by seven fen, there was no comparative price of the October and current wheat was not transacted. Shandong Wheat was at 4.1 yuan, Henan Wheat was at 4.05 yuan, Overseas Wheat was at 4.03 yuan and Jiangbei Wheat was at 4 yuan. A total of 1,700 packages were sold to Fuxin.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat, May 14th, May 15th, Increase/Decrease</p>
<p>July 92.00, 92.125, Up 0.25</p>
<p>September 93.00, 93.000, No Change</p>
<p>Canadian Wheat, May 14th, May 15th, Increase/Decrease</p>
<p>July 87.75, 87.625, Down 0.125</p>
<p>The bran market is declining because factories have large inventories and there is little demand from both local and foreign markets. The inland market is depressed because of economic depression and residents cannot feed livestock. Several companies were quoting 1 jiao net, and some were quoting 1 jiao discount, which is 4 or 5 jiao lower than the previous month.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Foreign Rice Holds Firm, Japonica Rice Continues to Fall <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>The foreign rice market saw renewed activity yesterday, with continuous inland demand. There were also inquiries from Jiujiang, Nanjing, and Northern China. Although the volume of transactions was not significant, the market sentiment was supported. Saigon No. 3 rice and No. 1 rice were inquired about by local Jiujiang buyers, causing prices to rebound immediately. Other types of rice also experienced gains. If there is a large volume of transactions in the next few days, prices may rise again. A total of 13,000 bags of Saigon rice, 4,000 bags of Da and Xiao Jiao, and 1,500 bags of Siamese rice were opened for sale, with inland demand accounting for the majority of transactions. Inland appetite for Kehsien rice was also active yesterday, and prices remained firm, with over 1,000 bags of Wenzhou, Sichuan, and Shashi Kehsien rice being opened for sale.</p>
<p>Local rice (from South Shanghai) saw only about twenty suppliers arriving yesterday (totaling over 4,000 shi), but sales were even slower. There were few inquiries from local buyers, and only 300 bags were purchased by the Qingdao guild. As a result, the market was depressed, and prices for Su-Tong and Nangang japonica rice, as well as Qingjiao and other early-harvested rice, fell by 1 to 2 jiao. The prices of Yinbian, Yuandu, Jian, and other varieties also continued to weaken. In North Shanghai, fifty-six ships arrived, but market demand remained weak. Early-harvested rice was the only type to sell well, and its price was only slightly higher than that of white japonica rice, about 1 to 2 jiao. The price of early-harvested rice was stable, while the price of Baiyuan fell slightly by nearly a jiao. The prices of other types of rice also fell slightly.</p>

<p>The sales of narrow strip tinplate from factories have been quite active recently, with strong demand from buyers. Therefore, the market situation is very good. The current estimated price is between 20.05 yuan and 21 yuan. It was observed that 160-170 boxes were opened for sale yesterday, and there are still many ongoing negotiations and requests for delivery. As a result, market confidence is strong.</p>

<p>— (Sun Lang)</p>
<p>People must eat, so they must work: if they didn't eat, why work? If they didn't work, where would the food come from?</p>
<p>Only eating and not working is a stupid pig; greedy for food and afraid of work is a lazy worm; eating and working, working and eating, can be called a human being.</p>
<p>A beggar who has been begging will only show a smile after death; or he is thanking God for removing the root of his pain.</p>
<p>The hands of the rich only consume; the hands of the poor are what produce; therefore, the more poor people there are in the world, the greater the productivity.</p>

<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>The broad bean is also called "cold bean" because this plant was originally herbaceous, but it is biennial (science divides it into annual, biennial, or perennial). Now, if you plant the seeds this year (around mid-August or September), they will only mature when raising silkworms next year. Don't you think it has passed two years? Therefore, judging from the bean's name, it has survived the cold winter without freezing to death, so it is called "cold bean." Its flowers are like small butterflies dancing on the branches, showing a purple-black beauty in the swaying spring breeze, pleasing to the eye. But when it forms the fruit, it is called the "bean pod," about three inches long and green in color, with a layer of snow-white fluff inside, almost like wadding, and there are three or four beans, like silkworms sleeping peacefully inside. When it is half-ripe, the front of the bean's embryo also reveals a curved black line, which looks very much like "moth eyebrows"; hence it is called "broad bean," which is really not bad!</p>
<p>There are two types of "broad beans" produced in my hometown: one is called "Green Cold," and the other is called "White Cold." If you eat them when they are tender, "White Cold" is naturally the best. Because "White Cold" has finer and softer meat, cooks quickly in a pot, and has thinner skin with no astringent taste, it is especially delicious. Like "Green Cold," its texture is hard. If it is dry and old, whether it is stir-fried or made into bean paste, it is no different from other vegetables. In the current vegetable foods, "White Cold" is always the best. "Broad beans" are on the market earliest in Guangdong, followed by Zhejiang. The ones eaten in Shanghai restaurants in February of the lunar calendar are mostly from Guangdong, followed by Zhejiang. The warmer the climate, the earlier the production. Like Jiading, they are just now coming on the market, which is the latest. Moreover, "White Cold" only grows in the villages near the city. If you go five or six miles outside the city, the "cold beans" in the fields all become "Green Cold," which is also very strange. Perhaps it is a change in the seed and the relationship with the soil; there is no other reason!</p>
<h3 id="e202">Quick Sketch on Bus Route 10 <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Muliang</p>
<p>Among the bus routes in the concession, Route 10 is probably the longest. It runs from Caojiadu in West Shanghai to Yinxianggang in East Shanghai. The two places it connects are both industrial areas, and the journey is about thirty li long.</p>
<p>It is rare to see wealthy old men and coquettish aristocratic women here. What you can see are people from all walks of life and the working class. Because of this, there is basically no order or hygiene. The noise and swirling smoke will really make people feel unbearable and want to vomit!</p>
<p>But here there are rare interesting stories, novel jokes... endless, it is a source of jokes.</p>
<p>The ticket seller seemed to recognize that Jiangbei woman and said: "Hurry up! Hurry up! You always drag your feet and bargain when you buy a ticket; we ticket sellers are not selling vegetables."</p>
<p>"Oh! Sir! A small matter of two coppers refund, why are you making such a fuss?"</p>
<p>"Damn your mother—you lost the coppers yourself and you're blaming me for making a fuss?" the ticket seller said, also speaking in the Jiangbei dialect.</p>
<p>That Jiangbei woman had long been angered by the ticket seller's words, so she rushed forward and slapped the ticket seller in the face, saying: "You want money and should speak nicely, why are you scolding people? I'll hit your cobbler's sign!" The ticket seller was not willing to show weakness. Moreover, after being slapped twice, he became even more enraged. Without listening to the Jiangbei woman's words, he also rudely beat the Jiangbei woman. As a result, everyone fought regardless of everything, and the order was completely disrupted. Fortunately, several peacemakers came out to smooth things over, and they all said in unison: "Okay! Okay! Everyone, don't quarrel anymore..."</p>
<p>This storm had just subsided when another storm came. A country bumpkin-like person, who had been sitting in the back corner of the bus sleeping, heard that Xiaoshadu Road had arrived, so he rushed out in a hurry. The Russian ticket inspector wanted to see his ticket. He had bought an eleven-cent ticket, and the Russian ticket inspector also seemed to recognize him. So, speaking in pure Chinese, he said: "You only bought eleven cents from Yinxianggang to here?"</p>
<p>"Mr. Russian! I fell asleep and forgot to get off. Thank you for letting me get off!"</p>
<p>"You are very bad. You always want to freeload. I met you at Xiaoshadu Road last time, pretending to be asleep, trying to get away with it. Today, pretending to be asleep is not allowed. I won't fine you for the ticket, but please get off at Caojiadu..."</p>
<p>This Russian ticket inspector's eyesight is really good. At the same time, his method of fining tickets is also very unique. He asked the friend who pretended to be asleep to get off at Caojiadu. Of course, this friend would have to go back to Xiaoshadu Road, so wouldn't the fare from Caojiadu to Xiaoshadu be equal to a fine? A laugh.</p>
<p>In short, there are many jokes on Bus Route 10, and some of them are unbelievable.</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Sometimes, the Empress Dowager would linger in this Imperial Dog Kennel for a long time: in addition to having the pugs perform for her as usual, she would also randomly designate a dog to be inspected. Of course, Her Old Highness would never deign to squat down to get close to them. The eunuch in charge of the dogs would always have to pick up the dog she designated, hold it up in front of her, and let her examine it carefully. After examining it, she would always say, "Its eyes are too dirty. Are you not taking care of things? You must pay attention to it in the future!" Or, "This dog's hind legs are too long, or too short, not the right size!" Or, "This dog's body is too long. It's too ugly!" After she gave one of these two comments to any dog—especially newborn puppies—it was as if they had received an order of exile and could no longer live in the palace. They had to be banished immediately. Because hind legs that were too long or too short, as well as bodies that were too long, were incurable defects, they had to be asked to leave. However, the eunuchs in charge of the dogs, to avoid trouble, often simply killed the dogs that had been ordered to be banished. Fortunately, the Empress Dowager would not investigate. But when it was a puppy that was being banished, they were not willing to kill it easily. They would secretly carry it out of the palace and sell it to acquaintances. The price was often considerable, because people knew that it was a dog brought out of the palace and were particularly eager to have it, so they were willing to pay more.</p>
<p>On this day, we had originally come to see the four puppies born by "Black Jade"; therefore, the eunuch in charge of the dogs hurriedly presented them in a bamboo basket. (316)</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Remarks</p>

<p>— Xu Bangda</p>
<p>Dong Yuan's "Dragon Dwelling Among Suburban People" (絹本大樻幅, silk scroll, large format), an old painting cherished by Zen masters, is considered as precious as "Autumn Mountains of Xiaoxiang." I have long admired it and finally had the opportunity to see it. The painting depicts layered peaks and valleys, with houses along the cliffs adorned with lanterns and colorful decorations. The residents appear to be dancing and rejoicing, conveying the idea of "Emperor Taizu descending to Jiangnan, with people offering food and drink to welcome the royal army." However, the inscription by Mo Jing mentions "rich and magnificent pavilions and terraces," which are not present in this version. Could there be another copy? The *cun* method (texturing strokes) uses broad "hemp fiber" strokes. The nearby trees are elegantly rendered with clustered dots and interspersed leaves. The mountaintops are depicted with small horizontal dots, differing from later Northern School followers who only used "nail-head" or round dots. The use of green and blue colors is especially unique and antique. A distant mountain is rendered in emerald green, giving a bright and pleasing effect. Ju Ran's "Cold Forest and Evening Peaks" still has good brushwork, but lacks an antique quality, likely a creation of a Yuan or Ming master. It doesn't compare to the true Ju Ran. I haven't seen any paintings by Yiying, but I've seen Fan Kuan and Guo Xi. Fan Kuan's large hanging scroll "Solitary Seated Figure by a Stream" is not good. Guo Xi's "Spring Snow on Mountains and Streams" is better, but "High Hermitage in a Mountain Villa" is not in the style of a Northern Song artist, lacking the rustic and integrated effect. The brushwork in the colored landscape is almost slippery at the corners where the lines bend, so it's not a painting by Xi. Su Hanchen's two paintings, "Autumn Garden Infants at Play" and "Peddler," are both excellent, especially "Infants at Play." One infant stands opposite another, one dressed in red, the other in white. The lines of the clothing are vigorous and rounded, the facial features are bright, and the lakeside rocks and autumn flowers are elegantly outlined and colored. A truly wonderful piece. Ma Hezhi's "Leisurely and Busy" is particularly bad. Liu Songnian's "Five Scholars" has good brushwork, but is not necessarily by Liu. "Silk Thread Drawing" is by a Ming artist. "Pavilion Second, the Four Pleasures" is a truly remarkable work of the Southern Song dynasty. The rocks are rendered with axe-cut strokes, with sharp edges protruding in all directions. The outlines of the pine bark are dense and weighty, and the houses and figures are all skillfully executed with precision and discipline. Among the three scrolls by Ma Xia, only "Willow Boats on West Lake" with a colophon by Guo Tianxi is relatively good. Qin Shan's painting, such as "Viewing the Moon," is a forgery. "Ten Thousand Miles of the Yangtze River Scroll" is by a Ming artist who studied the Northern School. The chopped strokes are weak and unconvincing, and the flow of the water is particularly lacking in freedom and dynamism. How could it be a painting by Gui? Qian Yutan's "Autumn Melon" is vaguely wonderful but I cannot recall in detail. Among the albums of Song and Yuan paintings, Qian Yutan's "Wild Fragrant Stone Fist" is the finest, and the paper is also pristine. Zhou Yuesu's "Yuanming Drunk" still has elegance. There are as many as eighteen Song paintings without inscriptions. Among them, "Loquat and Monkey Playing" is the best, almost on par with Yi Yuanji and his school. Zhao Mengfu's "Layered Mountains and Overlapping Peaks Scroll" is in the style of Guo Heyang. The texture strokes and ink washes resemble cursive script, and the small trees and dots of foliage are like piled cotton. The gentle hills reflect the slopes and rocks, creating an irregular composition. At the end of the scroll, two tall and elegant pine trees are depicted, with a small *kaishu* inscription reading: "Painted by Zhao Mengfu of Wuxing on the sixth day of the second month of the seventh year of Dade." In the upper right corner, there are five characters for the painting title, of which three are damaged. It is a first-class Yuan painting, a divine masterpiece that can be treasured alongside "Autumn Colors of Quehua." Zhu Zemin's "Playing Zither Beneath the Forest" is painted in the same style as Heyang, but lacks the refined, elegant and bold appeal. Huang Zijiu and Gao Fangshan's paintings are both ugly and crude. Fang Fanghu also has no fine works. Yifeng's "Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains," said to be the remaining section after the cloud-rising building burned down, is particularly clumsy and laughable. There are probably dozens of copies of this scroll, which will lead to many disputes. I don't know where Emperor Zhaoling's ancestral calligraphy copy is now. When I look at Shigu Zi's late-year copy, it is better than this one. Emperor Gaozong of Qing Dynasty's imperial inscription takes up all empty space, the songs and praises are dreamlike. Cao Yunxi's "Double Pines," Ke Danqiu's "Bamboo and Rocks," Wu Zhong'sheng's "Fisherman's Hermitage in Dongting," and Wang Shuming's "Eastern Mountain Thatched Cottage" are all fake and bad pieces. Only Shan Qiao has "Spring Plowing in Gukou," which completely imitates Dong Yuan and Ju Ran's hemp-fiber *cun*. Siweng's inscription says it is similar to our family's "Qingbian Painting," which is excellent, ancient and simple, following the path of his uncle, the paper is slightly worn, fortunately not damaging the painting. Mei Daoren's large silk painting, titled "Double Pine Trees," is good, but they are old cypresses, not Qin Daifu. The bamboo and rocks are also simple and elegant. Although Sheng Zizhao's "Autumn Forest High Scholar" cannot be compared to Zhonggui in terms of its elevated quality, it is still worthy of respect due to its strict adherence to the rules and regulations. The red-clothed person under the forest still retains the charm of the Tang and Song dynasties. Later generations criticized Zhonggui for living across from him, which is an overcorrection. Yunlin Zi's "Mountain View from the Riverbank" is extremely good, with vigorous brushstrokes and a tall peak with long *cun* strokes stretching straight down, surpassing Jing Hao and Guan Tong and entering the Northern Yuan style. How can we use the Ni Zan method of superimposed cakes and folded belts to paint? This scroll was painted for the recluse Wei Yun, so it is free and unrestrained. The "Narrow Room" is slightly restrained, but also elegant and beautiful. Gu Dingzhi and Zhang Yunmen jointly wrote about bamboo and trees, which Yang Lianfu inscribed. I don't know how, on the right side, there is a row of cloud forest rocks and long sentences, the inscription "Tongxuan recluse Ni Yu," the calligraphy is inferior, and Yu Weng's Yu, is it really self-proclaimed? If so, then Fan Kuan and Mi Dian can all write large scrolls. Gu Zhang's pen is a wonderful work, and Tie Sui Daoren is also only a small note. Lu Tianyou's "Five Auspicious Symbols" is a follower of the Wu School during the Zhengjia period, filling in the details. Zhang Shunzi, a Yuan person, is not very well-known, but the small scroll of trees and rocks is quite good. Li Shixing, whose courtesy name is Zundao, is the descendant of Xi Qi. The large painting of pine and stones is very strange. The basket beside the stone also reflects the family style. Wu Tinghui's "Dragon Boat Racing" is very exquisite. It is said that Hu Tinghui is old, not knowing if they are the same person? Guo Tianxi wrote the poetry intention of Gao Shijun, the painting is very ancient and beautiful, but it is not like a Yuan person's pen, if Wang Gengyan, it is almost close. Chen Xiaoran's "Jingxi Map," the silk is broken, the mountains and rocks are all studying Dong Yuan and Ju Ran, below are countless houses facing the stream, and there are dozens of inscriptions, Yunlin Zi Shang Zuo Sheng Wang Shuming Zhou Lvdiao, the rest I don't remember, all are famous scholars of the time.</p>

<p>As he pondered this, he had some ideas. So he turned around and asked Yueying again: "Why have you been waiting for us here for so long?" Yueying said: "Mr. Cheng's things in the house are all scattered. Mr. Cheng hasn't returned to his room, how could I dare to leave?" Zhiqian said: "What you say doesn't make sense. If we didn't come back until evening, would you wait until evening? Also, Miss Yang and your aunt, Hu Saozi, are both careless. How can they leave a young lady like you here by yourself?" Yueying said: "They went to apologize to Mr. Jia in front because he was unhappy." Zhiqian said: "Why was Mr. Jia unhappy? Is it because you missed your appointment and didn't accompany him to dinner?" Yueying lowered her head and hummed softly through her nose, indicating that he was right. When Zhiqian looked at Beihai again, he saw that his face was also red, as if he was also a little ashamed of this matter. So he sighed and said: "Judging by your character, you have a good path to follow. However, your family burdens you too much, preventing you from living comfortably and starving the two generations above you. Because of the two generations above you, you naturally have to suffer some grievances in the present. But thinking long-term, suffering a little grievance temporarily doesn't amount to much." Zhiqian first stated this grand principle, intending to continue with more words. However, Wang Beihai, sitting under the wall inside, couldn't bear it anymore and interjected: "That can't be said that way. If a person endures a little grievance temporarily for the sake of their career and then seeks development, that's understandable." (206)</p>

<h3 id="e207">The Chinese Egg Problem and Others <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Qiong Sheng</p>
<p>I don't know if it was because George Bernard Shaw was born in England, or if England produced George Bernard Shaw, but in any case, the gentlemen who come from this country all speak with great humor, which is very pleasant. The year before last, Mr. Shaw traveled to the Far East as part of a tour group. Newspaper reporters in Beiping, Tokyo, and other places asked him about the situation in the Far East. The old man's reply was that it was inconvenient to talk here and there was no freedom of speech there. This attitude was, of course, full of humor. But in the parliament in London, British gentlemen would not feel "inconvenient" or "unfree," and they could speak frankly. However, they still displayed their unique nature—humor.</p>
<p>Last year, a member of the British House of Commons questioned Japan's refusal to allow foreign troops to conduct exercises in the Yuguan area, saying it violated treaties, and asked whether Britain had protested. Simon replied that it was not so important that exercises could not be held in Yuguan, as there were many places inside the pass where exercises could be held. The entire hall burst into laughter. It was praised as "humorous." Recently, because of rumors that imported Chinese eggs contained bacteria, the House paid special attention and discussed the matter, resulting in another "humorous" story.</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from London on the 13th stated: "Sasby, representing the Minister of Health, said that recent research focused on the bacterial content of Chinese eggs. He heard that eggs did not decompose when they were removed from the ice. Han Lun said that Chinese eggs were produced under conditions that made people nauseous and should be banned from import immediately. Labor MP Lawson said that the living standards of Chinese chickens were actually lower than those of American chickens, which caused a burst of laughter in the hall."</p>
<p>In the eyes of gentlemen and ladies from various powers, there are many things in China that are in a "nauseating state." Japanese people talking about "Nanjing bugs" in China, Western European museums displaying "three-inch golden lotuses," Americans saying that Chinese people eat snakes—all of this is their impression of Chinese people. Not only that, but among "civilized people," it is often said that the Chinese nation lives in filthy mud like pigs and breeds like rats. The "Chinatown" of New York and the "Chinese Quarter" of Tokyo are mentioned with frowns and disgusted expressions, "making people nauseous." Therefore, we can imagine that the restrictions and exclusion of overseas Chinese in various countries are perhaps because Chinese people, like Chinese eggs, are nauseating, and therefore "banned from import"?</p>
<p>If that is the case, we can also "humorously" say, according to Lawson's words, "The living standards of Chinese people are actually lower than those of Americans." But why are the living standards of Chinese people lower than those of Americans? Isn't this the obvious result of the powers' aggression? However, the gentlemen and ladies of various countries understand humor, so they cannot say the "unhumorous" following words.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Sea Voyage <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Gong</p>
<p>What a treacherous voyage! A violent wind was blowing, with fine rain falling like broken threads. The waves were surging, hitting the tossing ship's body, creating a clamorous noise that echoed the sound of the engine below.</p>
<p>The remaining currents and splashes fiercely entered the cabin from the openings. Passengers huddled in the cramped and overflowing third-class cabin felt uneasy, threatened by the great force of nature, directly sensing the insignificance of life and the strange terror of death.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>Three to five dim lights were the only source of illumination, shining on the narrow wooden planks that served as beds, so cramped that they could barely accommodate a person, like various goods displayed in a shop window, separated by wooden boards.</p>
<p>Looking out from the cabin opening, the gloomy clouds and hazy sky, along with the raging waves, resembled an endless, infinitely simple ink painting, making people shiver.</p>
<p>Inside the cabin, bluish-gray, murky dust rose, weaving a heavy, terrifying veil. Thin, small creatures, like miscellaneous goods, gasped for breath within this veil.</p>
<p>On the second day of the sea voyage, near evening, the ship docked at a port.</p>
<p>People crawled out of the veil one by one, staggering and pacing on the deck. The treacherous voyage of the past two days had painted the same expression on everyone's face: pale, ashen, heads lowered on their chests, feet unusually weak, eyelids swollen and protruding.</p>
<p>The rain had stopped at some unknown time, and the sea breeze had become moist and gentle, with a cool, damp feeling all around. Under the heavy, low-hanging clouds, the dark waves rose and fell gently. In the distance, the sky met the water in a vast, misty expanse, with continuous mountains standing tall like screens on the sea. The darkness of night settled in.</p>
<p>People also regained their inherent reserve. The solemn gentlemen in first class chatted quietly, and occasionally a faint, clear laugh from a woman floated down. The laughter stirred the figures beneath the veil, and the jumbled dialects and kind-hearted curses began.</p>
<p>Enchanting music came from the deck above. Standing on the deck and looking up, under the brilliant lights, noble men and women each occupied a seat, chewing on things and dancing in pairs.</p>
<p>"Even in the most difficult places to adapt to nature, like a sea voyage, people are still separated far apart..." Similar vague feelings of melancholy rose unconsciously, and with excessive fatigue and厭心, each person repeated the cramming into the suffocating veil, curled up in the corner of the original board, and then remembered the forgotten ups and downs of family, saturated through the vicissitudes of the quiet heart wave, then set off the seeds of vagrant's bitter flavor.</p>
<p>The ship's body moved slightly to the side, the wet sea breeze blew in from the cabin opening, also bringing in charming music, the sound of water lapping lapping. Unbearable silence of the heart拘起 various thoughts.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Yearning Under the Sea <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Jia</p>
<p>I know that the sea is full of pain. When it rolls up a snow-white wave, and then rolls up another snow-white wave, it gently caresses the ochre-yellow shoreline, lamenting its unbearable sorrow.</p>
<p>(Yes! The sea is full of pain. At the pier, where colorful ribbons, handkerchiefs, and hats are waving, the Victoria, having just sailed off for a long voyage across the ocean, and the Comtesse Roussot, saturated with Parisian powder, are slowly entering! These enormous monsters carry thousands of tons of sorrowful separation! Those thousands of lines of bitter, sour tears of longing for distant loved ones gently seep into the heart of the sea, causing it to be forever sad! Forever sad! Its lament will never cease!)</p>
<p>And I also know that the sea is hardworking. When the sea fog blocks the clear light of the moon at night, and sprinkles down on the fishing boats with their single, flickering lights, the sea appears extremely desolate. Then, the sea sighs wearily, the sound is desolate and sobbing!</p>
<p>(Yes! The sea is hardworking. The sea is the greatest manual laborer, flowing its own blood day and night, nurturing countless lives—those fishermen and salt makers. They live by the enormous production of the seabed. Therefore, the sea is too hardworking! It has no leisure time, never wiping away sweat or shedding tears. Although it has sighed wearily!)</p>
<p>I am—a child who has failed the sea's love.</p>
<p>However, only I understand the sea, because I am a child of the sea. My body has been nurtured by the sea, my soul has been陶冶 by the sea. Therefore, I love the sea, just as I love my mother.</p>
<p>I grew up in a fishing village by the sea. I am familiar with the sea's cough, the sea's breath, and its pain, its hard work. I often offer heartfelt blessings.</p>
<p>When I tied my hair into two small buns (at that time, I only knew the sweetness of sugar and did not like the salty bitterness of salt!), I often spent the entire day at the beach. I knew how to pick a few wild flowers and grasses and insert them into the soft sand that had just been kissed by the sea, and hold solemn wild sacrifices with my little friends. I knew how to wait for the tide to recede and collect beautiful shells on the soft beach. Even though my hands were already full, the impression that the shells gave us was too enticing! Forcing me to take off the large straw hat I was wearing on my head and bring it home full of shells. I often gave my most beloved shells to my little sister, because my little sister was a shell collector. Or we would sit elegantly on the rocks by the sea, knowing how to gaze at the fishing boats floating and sinking in the waves. Watching white-feathered water birds sweep over our heads and fly into the sea. Paying attention to the purple and white clouds in the sky, transforming into a tree, a garden of spring flowers, a divine dragon, a red horse.</p>
<p>In this way, I grew up in the sea's brilliance. I believe that the time I spent in my mother's arms was less than the days I spent on the beach! The sea is my mother, my nanny!</p>
<p>However, I have failed the sea's love. It endowed me with the unique temperament of a coastal resident, but I could not use them one by one. Even more, in order to adapt to my environment, I compromised and hid them in the secret room of my heart!</p>
<p>Is it still lamenting unbearable sorrow? Is it still sighing wearily? My great mother, my yearning for you is too bitter and too heavy! Even in my dreams.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Miss Qin <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Ting Yi</p>
<p>Red and gold posters flew all over the street, announcing Miss Qin's debut at the Hongxing Teahouse. The owner of the Hongxing Teahouse was a well-respected figure. Every day, when he carried his birdcage from home to the teahouse, some people nodded to him, and some called him "Boss." He always casually inclined his head, grinding the pair of walnuts in his other hand with a clattering sound. But he treated those teahouse patrons with a different attitude. Because although he was called "Boss" of the Hongxing Teahouse, it was the local gentry and wealthy merchants who had taken out their wallets to organize this club-style teahouse. The owner naturally had to use his skills to deal with those masters who were like his providers. Miss Qin's performance at the Hongxing Teahouse was one of the owner's strategies to please those masters.</p>
<p>Before the sun had set, the large billboard in front of the Hongxing Teahouse, along with the major local shops, lit up the three large characters "Miss Qin" in electric lights. The owner personally greeted guests at the door, his fat face piled with fleshy wrinkles, his eyes naturally appearing even smaller, but his undeniable large belly protruded high outside his silk shirt. He smiled proudly, the pair of walnuts echoing the beating of his heart.</p>
<p>Upstairs, the four walls were hung with silk banners presented to Miss Qin by various masters, including various praises such as "Celestial Being Transformed" and "Clear Singing and Wonderful Dance." Rattan chairs were added along the walls, which were exclusively for the actual owners of the teahouse. The square tables in the center were for selling seats to outside guests. But now seats were also arranged next to the stairs. The owner's forehead was covered with large beads of sweat, as he moved from one master to another, sometimes speaking softly. As a result, everyone's face was full of smiles.</p>
<p>The electric lights on a plaque on the stage also lit up. It was a special gift to Miss Qin from Master Hu, who held the top position in the local area. On it was a poem, specially made to order from a Xiang Embroidery shop in Shanghai. For this grand gift, the owner accompanied Miss Qin to Master Hu's mansion last night to express their gratitude in person.</p>
<p>The scene became lively. The entire Hongxing Teahouse was disturbed by the noise. Countless pairs of eyes were focused on the embroidered curtain. Amidst a burst of enthusiastic applause, Miss Qin gracefully emerged from behind the curtain. She swept her gaze around, deliberately feigning a smile with a silk scarf covering the corner of her mouth. The masters couldn't help but clap their hands.</p>
<p>The *huqin* played the prelude for the second time. Miss Qin sang "Si Lang Visits His Mother," which Master Hu had personally requested last night.</p>
<p>The one called Master Hu sat on the side of the stage next to the wall. He was the first to receive Miss Qin's seductive gaze. Now he contentedly closed his eyes slightly, tapping the armrest of the rattan chair with the index finger, middle finger, and ring finger of his right hand. The leg resting on his left knee also swung naturally. At the end of each drawn-out phrase, he immediately clapped his hands together, but his enthusiasm was drowned out by the louder applause.</p>
<p>After Miss Qin finished singing, she picked up the golden teapot to moisten her throat. The owner, looking like a short, fat winter melon, rolled over to Master Hu again, humbly asking him to request a play. Master Hu secretly surveyed everyone to maintain his own dignity. He refused with a smile. So a folded note was passed to the second master, the third, the fourth... Everyone politely smiled and declined. At this moment, a loud voice flew out from the crowd:</p>
<p>"Sing Wujia Slope!"</p>
<p>No one had the leisure to investigate the source of this voice. Master Hu was the first to clap his hands, and naturally a series of applause rang out.</p>
<p>As usual, Miss Qin swept her gaze around the four walls, tapped her toes to the beat, and began to sing "Wujia Slope." In the second section, she put in extra effort, singing as Xue Pinggui, forcing her false voice to sing Wang Baochuan. The applause was like thunder, sending her back behind the embroidered curtain.</p>
<p>The audience was unwilling to leave immediately, their gazes all shooting toward the back of the stage. Some part of them had been captured by Miss Qin's flirtatious eyes. The owner bowed deeply, asking the masters to come earlier tomorrow.</p>
<p>As the guests left one after another, the owner flew to the backstage like a swallow, whispering in the ear of Miss Qin, who was taking off her makeup: "Master Hu is inviting you." At the same time, he gave the deputy town a hard to look at媚眼.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Uncle Yuan <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Li Qing</p>
<p>In the morning, at half-past six, everyone had already finished breakfast and gathered in the courtyard to pick mulberry leaves. The silkworms had awakened from their great sleep and started eating leaves. In another three or four days, they would be ready to spin cocoons. However, at this time, their appetite was enormous. Piles and piles of mulberry leaves were laid down, and immediately a rustling sound arose, like a sudden rain, sounding very clear and frequent.</p>
<p>Because the consumption of mulberry leaves was so fast, everyone picking mulberry leaves was working hard.</p>
<p>Especially in the morning, the first batch after the dew had dried was clipped the most. The courtyard was piled high, full, and children and adults were all working; this lively scene was still a first this year.</p>
<p>While working, they chatted idly to resist fatigue, a common strategy for physical laborers. So, Uncle Yuan's bragging started again.</p>
<p>First, Ah Kun mentioned planting melons, and Uncle Yuan said, full of spirit:</p>
<p>——In recent years, fewer people are planting melons. Hey, Ah Kun, you didn't see it, but seven or eight years ago, the watermelons in front of Chen Family Village were so big! So lush, Ah Si and I would always get one or two loads in one night!</p>
<p>Aunt Yuan then chimed in: ——Stealing melons, what kind of good thing is that? You're still talking about it so loudly!</p>
<p>But Uncle Yuan didn't care at all and continued to talk on and on, and Ah Kun and Ah Mao also joined in, boasting about their skills in stealing melons. They thought: "Stealing melons doesn't count as stealing."</p>
<p>Before long, Long-Legged Ah San returned from the street with a piglet. He brought people an ominous message:</p>
<p>——This year's silkworm prices are unreasonable again. Both cocoon merchants want to open, but I heard the highest price is only twenty yuan per batch. The villagers are really on their way to ruin!</p>
<p>Many people's faces were covered with worry. Only someone as muddleheaded as Uncle Yuan was still enthusiastically saying:</p>
<p>——It really can't compare to before! A few years ago,</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>eight or nine years ago, Ah Mao, you didn't see it! The cocoon merchants were packed so tightly that no air could get through, and no one could squeeze in, let alone selling cocoons! Many people from the sandbars would come before dawn, wanting to take advantage? Bargain, how easy would that be? People there wouldn't let you squeeze in, and there were many stronger than you. And the locals only helped the locals, why would they help you sandbar people? Ah, it was really sinful to watch, they waited until sunset and still hadn't sold them, their stomachs growling with hunger, and they didn't have any money to buy snacks, so they could only prostrate themselves on the bridge and cry like women! Crying, crying to death, no one would pay attention to them!</p>
<p>Before everyone could express their opinions, Uncle Yuan continued impatiently:</p>
<p>——Cocoons used to be expensive, seventy or eighty yuan per load. There were benefits, so naturally, there were more people raising silkworms. To be honest, back then, only Ah Pe and I sold cocoons in the village, squeezing in and squeezing out. Selling for ourselves and selling for others, who was fierce? A punch! Retaliate? Hmph, don't even think about it! Unless he didn't want to sell his cocoons for money! …</p>
<p>Uncle Yuan wanted to continue, but Aunt Yuan couldn't stand it anymore. She scolded:</p>
<p>——Stop bragging, I think you really have no shame!</p>
<p>But the others were silent, each smiling in their own different ways; they knew that Uncle Yuan was strong, and his words wouldn't be false. But this glorious history of boasting was, after all, from the past! In recent years, that kind of situation has simply never happened. —Maybe it will never happen again?</p>
<h3 id="e212">A Teahouse Scene <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Jian</p>
<p>In the season after spring has passed, the weather is gradually warming up: the clouds have a dark, heavy appearance, the leaves have a full, lush green of their prime, the streamside has the incessant croaking of frogs, and in the deep night's dreams there are red lotuses, and the people living in this warm current also have a kind of restless mood.</p>
<p>"Go search for the outside world!" Some people might have that kind of mood and go to a teahouse to steep a pot of tea, let it cool, wave a fan, and prop up their legs to watch the hustle and bustle of all kinds of people, to while away an early summer afternoon: but if you say that everyone who goes to the teahouse is suffering from indigestion, or has eaten too much and wants to use it to massage their overfull nerves, that can't be said to be entirely true. In the teahouse—even a small teahouse on the edge of a village next to a "tiger stove," people often gather there, bustling, arguing, discussing, lamenting all kinds of terrible, unpleasant problems in life, the restlessness and emotional disputes caused by the hard times, the fistfights caused by one or two silver coins; there, impatience, worry, resentment, sighs… the martial spirit of the heart mixes together, just like the mixing of countless different types of faces and different tones of voice.</p>
<p>Since the days of being a big child, in order to find a life buried at the end of the world, I have drifted far away from home for countless years. When I was young, I often saw the wandering flavor of foreign "gypsies" in the small teahouses in town; now that I've rekindled the memories of my childhood, and when I go to the teahouse, familiarly exchange four copper coins for a token and find a comfortable spot to sit down, the teahouse is no longer what it used to be.</p>
<p>The room is dark, with three or five rays of sunlight filtering in dimly. Several broken square tables are scattered around, people sit haphazardly on benches, talking haphazardly, arguing haphazardly. In the corner of the hall is still the broken wooden platform for singing folk songs, but no one is singing anymore, and no one has the leisurely mood to listen. People, with different faces, but with the same gaunt look, sweat dripping from their heads, uttering different sounds, looking at the walls and ceiling blackened by smoke and fire with pale eyes, but their minds are full of calculations and attempts: how to negotiate a small deal or two to buy rice, how to open their mouths to borrow three or five silver dollars to buy steamed buns, how to drag those who borrowed three or four cents of "usurious" interest from the annual government and use rough voices and strength to force them to repay. Face readers run around, putting up the sign of "skilled in observing expressions," greeting people with flattering smiles and formulaic jargon; but people, having lived in long-term displacement, have also learned to doubt fate. Even if someone really wants to know when there will be an end to the next hardship, they remember that the few copper coins in their pockets are still needed to live for another day, so they silently lower their heads, listening to the noise, insults, arguments, and fights of the people around them.</p>
<p>Who can say that the teahouse has a lovely hustle and bustle anymore—that should be a dream of the past. Now the teahouse still exists in the small village, but what is unfolding there is only the mortal combat of life and unhappiness.</p>
<p>They say: the teahouse is soft and sweet, but that is a thing of the past.</p>

<h3 id="e215">Once a Year Beauty Queen <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>Before Wang Renmei entered the film industry, she was generally known as the "Beauty Queen." Since starring in the "Fisherman's Song" dubbed by Dentsu last year, it has been a full year since she parted ways with the audience. During this long year, she joined the mighty Dentsu. The fully voiced, singing feature film "Children of Wind and Cloud," which Dentsu will soon release, is the culmination of her efforts over the past year. With its poignant and magnificent content, and its plot of joys and sorrows, under the hard work of director Xu Xingzhi, it further unfolds the new acting skills of this "Beauty Queen." Once a year, we will see Wang Renmei's lively and abundant posture again.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Tang Na to Play the Male Lead in "City Scenery" <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>Tang Na, who came out of St. John's University the year before last to write film reviews, is now a screenwriter at Yihua Film Company. After completing the assistance in writing "Escape," he still had time. Recently, Dentsu hired him to play a male lead in Yuan Muzhi's "City Scenery," and he agreed to begin his new practice in film acting.</p>
<p>Tang Na, he has extensive film knowledge and is the most diligent film critic. He is also unusually qualified as an actor: a healthy physique, a handsome appearance, coupled with his rich scholarship and the help of a director who specializes in acting, this will surely open up a bright star future for him in addition to his many other achievements. This is probably good news that his literary lovers will be happy to know.</p>

<p>The Chinese Film Society has now established a National Library, with Ms. Zhou Diyun in charge. It is said that a deaf-mute film fan donated several hundred books, all about film.</p>
<p>Recently, several slippery companies have appeared in Shanghai that neither film nor act as introduction agencies. Film fans, don't be fooled!</p>
<p>The Star Photography Studio recently built a city scene, which is extremely grand. Some jokingly call it "Movie City."</p>
<p>It is reported that Hu Die and her husband Zhou Jianyun have already set off to return to the country yesterday and are expected to arrive in Shanghai in about three weeks.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Yihua Odds and Ends <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>Yuan Meiyun is sick, lying lonely in bed, not moving at all. Her face is so pale, her eyes so dull, her voice so low… Bitter tears flowed in her eyes, staring blankly at the ceiling, like being nailed to a wooden board and unable to move. ——"Storm" Yesterday, such a moving scene was filmed.</p>
<p>A large number of "prostitutes" perform in "Storm."</p>
<p>Is "Victory Song" working extremely hard these days?</p>

<h3 id="e219">Han Langen Almost Played a Monk Getting Married <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>Han Langen was originally supposed to shave his head for the role of Xiao Baba in "Autumn Fan Bright Lamp," but the filming coincided with his wedding date. It would have been too much to have him marry his new wife with a shaved head, along with her dazzling veil, so the director had to change the script slightly to accommodate him. However, that concession came with a condition: he had to kowtow three times to his new wife in front of the partygoers on his wedding night and go to the photography studio to film the next day.</p>
