<p>舉世屬目之意阿爭端。現已入於無可調和之階段。據最近消息。意軍之集結束菲者。達十師之衆。人數在十八萬五千左右。擬俟雨季過後。開始軍事行動。是意阿戰爭之爆發。不過月餘之時間耳。此次意國必欲對阿用兵。雖藉口於邊境糾紛。然其動機實有多端。意大利在歐戰時。曾獨當一面。其後歐洲歷次國際會議。意亦為一重要角色。而戰後德屬殖民地之瓜分。意獨向隅。自難免於悻悻。今者歐洲局勢有利於意。正可乘此良機。謀東菲殖民地之擴展。此其一。法西斯之統治。以發揚國威為極則。墨索里尼執政至今。已十餘年。為鞏固其個人在國內之威望計。為國家民族之榮譽計。皆有耀武揚威之必要。此其二。阿比西尼亞在四十年前。曾大敗意大利之遠征軍於阿特華。此一歷史上之恥辱。亦有賴墨索里尼為之洗雪。此其三。墨索里尼曾謂戰鬥之精神。必須有戰爭之行為。始得發揮之。而戰鬥之技術。尤須有戰爭之經驗。始能趨於熟練精進之域。可知此次對阿用兵。實欲喚起國民勇猛有為之戰爭情緒。使阿比西尼亞成一意大利事實上之練兵塲。此其四。意國近年實施法西斯蒂政治。失業人數。仍年有增加。用兵東菲。可以解决國內之失業問題。此其五。</p>
<p>意大利旣具如上之種種意志。且明白表示。必欲夷阿國為保護國之地位而後已。而阿國國王則最近對國人聲稱。謂交換十地猶可辦到。若欲割地。或竟欲夷阿國於保護國之地位。則無論如何不能接受。若意國竟以武力相加。唯有盡己之力。以與意人周旋。雙方態度。若是堅决。焉有和平可言。國聯行政院雖將於本月二十五日開會。作最後之調解。然其成功殊無希望。國聯之中。法國態度。處於極重要之地位。法之不欲助英敵意。亦已屢有表示。蓋使失歡於意。而致意國退出國聯。轉與德國携。手於法國外交。上當為一重大之打擊。法苟稍具理智。必不出此一着也。墨索里尼洞見此中癥結。故對阿問題。敢放手做去。英無法助。則孤掌難鳴。本月十一日英外相郝爾在國會演說。謂對意計劃制裁。事屬子虛。可知意國行動。雖對英在東菲利益有嚴重之威脅。而英國方面尙不敢公然阻止。綜觀各方情勢。可比西尼亞問題之在國聯。殆將　　東北事件同其運命矣。</p>

<p>（一）宣吿「不准上訴」為違法、竊按刑事訴訟法第三六七條、「不服高等法院之第二審或第一審判决而上訴者、應向最高級法院為之」、又「最高級法院審判不服高等法院第一審判决之上訴、亦適用第三審程序」、第三六八條「刑法第六十一條所列各罪之案件、經第二審判决者、不得上訴於第三審法院」、明文為「經第二審」、非為「經高等法院」、則此次本案祇經高等法院第一審、該院又何能强制被告為必服、今宣吿不准上訴、顯為剝奪被吿之上訴權、而違背法律明文、</p>
<p>（二）不採用較輕刑法、為故意加重行為人之損害、竊按「閒話皇帝」一文、作者為易水、應負徒刑之責任、亦為易水其人、杜君為編輯及發行人、該文發刊之日、杜君、適在外埠、（有種種事實證明）未曾過目因該刋另一編輯人之疏忽、而發刋此文、並不能證明杜君出於共同行為、情節較輕、自應處以舊刑法三二五條新刑法三一零條一千元以下之罰金、蓋刑法上規定、罰金之用意、亦正為此、今該院舍其應有之輕者、而判决不應有之重者、非故意加重行為人之損害而何、</p>

<p>— 張明昕</p>
<p>（一）國家專營、日本鑒於英國簡易壽險、非由國家專營、以致萎靡不振、趨於失敗、故創設伊始、即參酌國情、予以改變、定為國家專營事業、利用全國巳有之七千餘郵局、辦理此項業務、用費旣省、事業亦易普及、故自開辦以來、進展極速、而為國營簡易壽險成績之優良者、</p>
<p>（二）目的不在牟利、簡易壽險、係一種社會事業、投保者大都為中下級人民資力微薄者、所繳之保費、雖屬無多、然點滴皆出自汗血中節省而來、普通壽險公司除經營費外、即其股東紅利、亦須計及、因之增加投保者之担負、而與簡易壽險辦理之原旨相反、故歐美各國兼營簡易壽險之公司、每年所獲巨額之利益、即為各方非難民營簡易壽險之一大原因、而其互相競爭之結果、致使智識淺薄之民衆、不知所從、且保費增高、失效契約加多、不免影響事業本身、亦發生危險、故國營之簡易壽險、旣不以牟利為目的、又無額外之費用、自可减輕保戶之担負、如有盈餘、其全部盡可從事保戶福利事業之設施、此日本於創設之際、即基於實現社會政策、而定為不牟利之事業也、</p>
<p>（三）積存金運用之規定、積存金為多數保戶努力節省之保費所滙集者、由保險人保管生息、以作將來給付保險金額之準備、普通壽險公司、對於其積存金之運用、多作利息優厚之投資、至投資事項、對於保戶之是否有利、則無眼計及、日本簡易壽險、旣為國家專營、且以不牟利為主旨、其積存令運用之方針、自屬不同、故於創辦時、規定應運用於公共有利事業之投資、並設運用委員會以監理之、更利用資金還原方法、避免集中一地、蓋即取之於民、用之於民之意、其投資之範圍、如小學校·醫院·平民住宅·農村事業·水利事業·公共職業介紹所·托兒所等、不一而足、是則簡易壽險、直接旣可使民衆養成儉樸儲蓄之風、以少數金錢獲得保險利益、間接尤可助長國民經濟及物質之建設、而促進社會之繁榮、固彰彰明甚也、</p>
<p>（四）會計獨立、為求事業基礎業固、及不受國家他項財政影響起見、日本簡易壽險之會計、規定為獨立性質、與國家他項會計、不相混合、一九一六年、其帝國議會通過之簡易壽險特別會計法、會規定簡易壽險之歲入、即充其歲出、其歲入項下、為保險費及積存金所生之收入、至其歲出、則為保險金付還金事業費及共他費用、並規定其歲入發生不足時、得由積存金補助之、除第一年度（實為六個月）因契約成績超過預計一倍以上、致預算歲出不足、山國庫所保存之積存金補助六萬餘元外、其積存金之增長、實足驚人、而歷年來對於保戶之條欵、亦日趨優待、尤足證共積存金巳超過責任準備矣、</p>
<p>（五）保健設施、人壽保險之主旨、除保障家庭經濟損失、及增加社會財富外、對於被保人生命之延長、亦負有重大之使命、現代各國經營壽險事業者、對於保戶健康之設施、莫不年縻鉅欵、力求完備、蓋被保人生命之延長、影響於死亡率之低减、同時社會之生產力、即可增加、於壽險事業之本身、實有莫大之裨益、日本簡易壽險創設伊始、即劍及屨及注意於被保者健康問題、幷極力研究各種適當之設施、至一九二二年、因其事業巳形穩固發展、先於全國各地設立健康診察所七處、至一九三四年時、巳逐漸增至一百七十五所、利用此項設施着、巳達四百二十餘萬人、其設施之種類、大別為五種、即（一）健康診察所、（二）健康刋物之印行、（三）健康衛生之宣傳、（四）國民健康體操之創設、（五）結核預防運動之合作等、於簡易保險局設中央健康診察所、規模最大、共性質雖與各地診察所殊無二致、惟不作訪問看護事務、因該所實為處理各地不易設施之事項、如費用較巨之醫術設備、血淸檢查、及各種測驗設施等、現時合全國一百七十五所計算、共有醫師二百零三人、看護四百十七人、X光事務二十二人、其他職員一百五十四人、每年每所經費定為一萬元、計每年共需此項經費之支出、為一百七十五萬元、其造福保戶、殊不可謂不巨也、</p>
<p>六、我國籌設簡易壽險之經過</p>
<p>我國為經濟落後國家、自受世界不景氣瀰漫、以致工商業日形衰落、農村幾瀕破產、尤復外患頻仍、迄無虛日、水旱天災、紛至沓來、危迫情形、誠如纍卵、所幸近年以來、剿匪大計、將吿完成、地方秩序、漸趨安謐、建設事業、日形進步、是在國人之　撕警覺、艱苦奮鬥、則多難興邦、固非不可預期、昔人有言、「三年耕而有一年之積、九年作而有三年之儲」、則簡易壽險事業之培養人民儉德、而寓儲蓄於保險、裨益於國計民生物質建設者、又豈能因噎廢食、而不亟圖舉辦乎、明乎此、則我國籌設簡易壽險之意義、思過半矣、茲略述國營理由及其經過如下、</p>
<p>（一）簡易壽險何以應由國家專營、簡易壽險辦理之主旨、固已一再言之、惟何以應由國家專營之理由、茲作簡單之叙述、一曰基礎鞏固、簡易壽險、以大多數民衆為保險對象、所繳保費、點滴皆從辛苦節儉而來、且須按月繳付、倘保險業之基礎發生動搖、其精神上物質上實受莫大之痛苦、尤以公司工廠等之加入份子、多為集團之契約、驟遭不幸、人數旣衆、呼籲尤烈、若任民營公司經營、必致營利競爭、不幸偶有動搖、影響人民、為害甚鉅、故宜劃歸國家專營、以國庫保存之積存金為擔保、旣有確實之保障、基礎自能鞏固、二曰非營利目的、簡易壽險旣為社會事業之一種、則其目的自以不營利為前提、因營業上之特殊、經營事業費之支出、亦比較龐大、同時對於保費又必求低廉、故必利用旣設而且普遍之郵政機關及其人員、以編理此項業務、然后可期减低一且費用、而將其所積資金、按社會政策之方針運用生息、以謀增進人民福利、此尤非民營壽險公司之經營方針與其力量、所能勝任愉快者也、三曰事業普及、簡易壽險事業、倘由民營、則因收支之關係、勢不能不以都市為經營之重要地、對於其他城邑、則多漠視、求其普及、蓋亦甚難、而在國家專營、則可統籌並顧、普及全國、使窮鄉僻壤之人、皆得有利用之機會、務使斯業創辦之旨趣、得以貫澈實現、而收事半功倍之效、</p>
<p>（二）關於簡易壽險法之制定、郵政儲金滙業局、於其開辦後之第二年即民國一十年秋、因簡易壽險、關係國計民生之重要、擬定簡易人壽保險法、呈交通部核轉立法院審核、中因九一八及一二八事變粉乘、進行頓挫、迨朱家驊氏蒞任交通部長、以簡易壽險事業、於國家社會貢獻頗大亟應籌設、以增進國民福利、乃呈由行政院轉咨立法院續予審議、一面令行郵政儲金滙業局、迅速籌辦、及擬訂實施計劃呈部備核、嗣立法院將草案交由法制經濟兩委員會覆議、經數度審核後乃於本年（二十四年）第十四此大會通過、旋於同年五月十日、奉國民政府明令公布、而儲滙局復奉令草擬附屬　章則亦經呈部核轉矣、</p>
<p>（三）派員赴日考察簡易壽險事宜、國營簡易壽險事業、以日本辦理成績最為優良、前已言之、我國社會情况與日本亦較為近似、作老昔年在美專研人籌保險、自任職於郵政儲滙局後、乃專責籌辦簡易壽險事宜、幸承部長朱公葑菲不遺、於去年秋派遺東渡、赴日考察簡易壽險一切事宜、蒞日以後、曾至其簡易保險局、（即辦理全國簡易保險業務之總局郵政貯金局、（即郵政儲金局）及其一·二·三等郵政局與簡易壽險中央健康診察所等、詳加考察、即內部辦事手續、亦不祇求詳、細加探索、並嘗與其專家研求討論、歷時共二月有餘、又曾蒐集各項材料四百餘種、以為吾人借鏡之資、</p>
<p>（四）最近籌備情形、國營簡易壽險、實為偉大事業、共辦理手續、為適應民衆需求、易以推進業務起見、對外力求簡便、而內部手續則頗繁瑣、尤必有充分之準備、然後可期順序進行、故郵政儲滙局、近正極力籌備於上海·南京·漢口·三地先行開辦、然後逐漸推及於全國、惟日本簡易壽險之成功、除辦理人員忠勤盡職努力從公外、而社會人士之贊助、尤為重要、是簡易壽險、非羣策羣力、莫能奏效、惟望吾國人士、對於此項新興之社會保險事業、予以宣傳提倡、誠不勝其馨香禱祝者也、</p>
<p>七　結論</p>
<p>因篇幅之所限、以上所述、簡易壽險與社會保險之功用·及其經過、僅得梗概、惟人壽保險事業、實為社會經濟之一種必要組織、此項事業之發達、嘗繫於國家文明之進步、而簡易壽險又為實現社會政策、裨益國計民生、以救濟一般民衆所受經濟損失之設施、法良意美、無逾於此、各國辦法、雖各不同、而共重要原則、莫不一致、普通人壽保險、流傳我國已數十年、以言進步、則殊形遲滯、現時所有之人壽保險公司、數亦寥寥、以之辦理普通壽險、猶慮不足、遑言更進而兼辦簡易壽險、此政府當局所以有簡易壽險之籌設、以應人民之需要、然辦理之主旨、並不與民營壽險公司立於互相競爭地位、因其保　已有相當限制、如保戶因進益比較優俗、欲求充實其經濟上之保陣者、固可再向民營壽險公司、作比較大額之壽險投保、且因簡易濤險有普遍之宣傳、以普及保險思想、尤能增進民營壽險公司之業務、是直接問接對簡易壽險之辦理、於民營壽險公司均為有利也、明昕、二十四年、七月十五日、（完）</p>

<p>— 瘦鵑</p>
<p>悼念鄭正秋先生</p>
<p>天哪！這三年以來，畢竟是一個甚麽時代？內憂，外患，茨災，人禍，全體動員的壓迫着這可憐的中國，直弄得百孔千瘡。焦頭爛額。國土的損失，經濟的損失，人才的損失，文化的損失，都不是表格所能一「開列，數字所能二淸算的。天哪！這將歸咎於天心的不仁呢，或是人謀之不臧？</p>
<p>這三年來，親長師友的先後凋謝，巳使我於慘痛之餘，灰心於人世。郤不道二十年的老友鄭正秋先生，又撒手歸天去了。這在人才損失單中，又是很重要的一項，竟使我駕呆了好幾天。不但是明星公司失了一根柱石，電影界中失了一位導師，便是中國的藝術上和文化上也失郤了一個奮鬥的戰士。</p>
<p>回憶二十年來，他在舞台上銀慕上的貢獻，是何等的偉大。年年五月，我常能瞧見他在舞台上現身說法，表演「隱痛」和「黃老大說夢」，痛哭流涕的，想喚醒國人的迷夢。那知世變時移，江河日下，正秋正秋，宇宙雖大，到如今巳沒有你痛哭流涕之地了。雖不病死，也得活活的悶死！所以我一面悼念正秋，一面郤替正秋慶幸，因為一了百了，這世界又有甚麽留戀呢？</p>
<p>正秋，你雖悄悄的死了，但是你的精神不死，你的靈魂不死。且待秋墳鬼唱時，我們仍可看你的「隱痛」，聽你的一黃老大說夢」。</p>
<h3 id="c142">凉亭 <a href="#c142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>在一條挺長的官塘大路上邊，隔上十里八里的遠近，總有一所凉亭矗立着。雖是頹垣敗壁，沒有一些風景好玩賞，可是給走長路的人歇歇脚，透透氣，倒也功德無量。尤其是熱天，人們在火傘底下走着，兩旁沒有樹蔭遮蔽，汗珠兒像黃荳大的掛下，在那凉亭裏歇一回，好比吃人參果一般的爽快。所以這涼亭一件東西，在鄉間倒不是一件點綴品，眞是一位普濟行人的慈善家咧。</p>
<p>凉亭的構造，大小雖不一律，形式總是這樣的：尖尖的項兒，圍着鳥翼般的瓦楞，有四方形的，有六角八角形的，也有長方形的；四周砌着短短的護脚墻，坐在裏邊，可以瞧見東南西北四方的景色。長長的石條，便是行人的安樂椅。那粗糙的石面，給人坐得光潤油滑，可見這條路每日不知有多少爭名奪利的人經過，坐在那石上淌汗喘氣。我想那石條有知，也在暗笑世人的忙忙碌碌，所為何來咧！</p>
<p>在那凉亭裏歇脚的，總是販夫走卒以及那失意的朋友；高貴的人們，他們有着車兒船兒，决不到此光顧的。人們到此坐着，用不着互攀尊姓大名，你愛淸靜，獨個坐一下子，拔脚就跑；你愛胡扯的，和同坐的「東說梁山西說海」瞎談一陣，也可解除煩悶。况且你遇到的人，在何年何月再碰見，也不知道，眞有「萍水邂逅」「相逢何必盡相識」的慨嘆咧！</p>
<p>「凉亭雖好，不是久戀之塲」。這是實在的：人們到此，歇了一回便走，斷沒有住上十天八天的。不過也有那凉亭給那些乞兒們打上公館，在亭子的角隅，砌上十竈，薰得那墻壁墨黑；石凳便是他們的床舖，草薦，竹竿，破籃，攤滿了一地，遇到這種情形，眞令行人不敢歇足咧。</p>

<p>— 憶秋</p>
<p>月夜，密叢叢的椰子樹下，軟綿綿的綠草地上，坐着一個個年輕的姑娘，悠閒地弄着手裏的月琴，（或是琵琶）一種美妙的聲和色，誘惑着許多過路的靑年，都一個個跑到伊們的身旁坐下，偎着的摟着，唱着，不多一會，一對一對的回家去了；這種姑娘皮膚雖帶些棕色，但很細膩而豐美，凡是靑年人，總覺得伊們是可愛的。——這是南洋羣島荷屬爪哇的特殊情調。</p>
<p>河水不深而很淸澈，許多女人騎在一頭頭巨象的身上渡河，象的身上，有的還架着一張小小的天幕，以避灼人的驕陽；最奇怪的伊們那雙豐滿而美麗的乳房是任人展覽，並不用衣服遮住，據設，伊們為了祟拜處女，所以敞着前胸，裸着雙乳，表示伊們還是處女，不怕人家檢閱的意思。——這是暹羅附近的士人</p>
<p>這兩段熱帶情調，是現在南洋獻藝紅極一時的潘文娟小姐信中吿知我的，我覺得還有味兒，特再轉吿春秋讀者。</p>
<h3 id="c144">臭蟲瑣話 <a href="#c144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— 醉痴生</p>
<p>日前讀尤愛梅君「斷雲零雨錄」。說起寳應縣的故事：無論那一家商店裏，對於臭蟲之為物，都是不肯勦滅的。並且諱言臭蟲之名，叫它做「財蟲」云云。在下因此想起十餘年前，有位朋友黃君。他是個大塊頭，在北市開了一家很大的店鋪。到了夏季，夥友們都被臭蟲鬧得夜不安枕，要設法來撲滅。可是這位老闆，（黃君）却安之若素。他還代臭蟲作辯護，說：這臭蟲是「富貴蟲」、有錢的人家纔會有。不比窮人身上的白虱，是令人可憎的。你想，上海人日衆多，商務茂盛，所以臭蟲有這樣多。倘然沒有這「富貴蟲」，市面那有這樣的繁榮呢？人家聽了他這一席話，都笑不可仰。現在他的店舖，早已失敗而閉歇了。至於市面的不景氣，也達於極點了。不知他對於富貴蟲，當作如何感想。再愛梅君說：蘇州有一種特殊的風俗。遇着女子出嫁，總要捉兩隻臭蟲，拿紅紙包了，塞在床縫裏。因為臭蟲一夜能生九子，是取吉兆的意思，不知是否確實？在下曾問過幾位蘇州朋友，都說：絕沒有這回事的。</p>
<p>上月十五日本報增刋有「勦滅臭蟲運動」一文：內說，「外國有沒有臭蟲，不得而知。但從日本人叫臭蟲為「南京蟲」一點上看，臭蟲好像是中國獨有的」。云云：按臭蟲，外國也有。晨報的「晨曦」欄內，近載「歐游日記」。曾說：「莫斯科某大旅館中，臭蟲很多，徹夜不得安眠」。足見臭蟲並非是中國的專有品。不過外國人善於藏拙，不像中國人容易顯醜。所以沒有「莫斯科蟲」等雅號了：</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>這眞是一個很嚴重而驚人的報吿！我雖然是站在太后御座後面的一幅簾慕的背後，不能瞧見伊的正面，但我却曾很淸楚地瞧見伊的背部突然的一聳，由此便可揣知伊老人家聽了這報告以後，必然也巳感到相當的刺激；而我自己却對此尤為注意，因為這個被控訴的廣東撫台某某，乃是我父親的老朋友。人家控訴他的罪狀，我雖然未曾仔細看過，但也很知道幾條；想來這個人在廣東那邊所做的事情，必然太專制了些，並且太忽略了他所受命撫牧的合省百姓的疾苦和公意了，以致百姓們無不銜之刺骨，大家便私下組織起來，先後到京內來吿御狀，連這最後的一次在內，已有十四五次之多了。他們控吿他的罪狀是很特別的，我至今還約略記得幾條：</p>
<p>第一條　侵吞公欵；</p>
<p>第二條　强刧廣州商富，勒索金錢；</p>
<p>第三條　公然在市上酒樓食肆宴飲，有失官方；</p>
<p>第四條　以暴力逼選本省良家民女，充作妾媵：</p>
<p>第五條　某次出城巡行時，因一老年乞丐不知避讓，突過鹵簿，致為該撫軍</p>
<p>縱容家丁，持鞭痛毆，立斃途中；</p>
<p>第六條　私自揑藏各方貢呈太后之禮品。（三七一）</p>

<p>他不慌不忙，笑着答道：這件事是很好解决的。常言道是作此官，行此禮。假如兄弟有作到廳長的那一天，新生活運動，還是很熱烈的話，我當然不抽烟。就是現在高所長給了我一個差事，我也一定提倡舊道德，講起仁義禮智信來。志前笑道：對於討姨太太這一件事呢？志前這倒成到有點困難，抬起手來，搔了兩搔頭髮道：這倒是新舊思想一點衝突。在舊道德上說，述聖人都討妾的，這並不是壞事。可是新道德上，又說的是一夫一妻制。敎我說，我是不好說。我是個現代的人，可是贊成提倡舊道德。所以我的話是很難說的了。說着話，依然是不住的搔頭髮。那可以看出他措詞雖很難，到底還是很得體。志前道：本來見仁見智，各有不同。說着，淡淡的一笑。好像在這一笑之內，似乎也有些批評，介夫倒也是不曾去理會。嘴裏斜啣了烟捲，坐着向外直噴出來。許久才微笑道：程先生在西安，情形是比兄弟熟悉的多，不知夾袋裏有當勤務的這種人才沒有？若是有，可以介紹一個給兄弟。志前本來是有些不願意和和他談話，不過他談到了想用聽差，倒猛可的想起一椿心事。那個老瓦匠，不是十分的重託着，想把他的姪兒子找一項工作嗎？這就兩好凑一好，正可以介紹給他。便答道：提到這個我倒是有個人可以介紹張先生等着要用嗎！（二七一）</p>

<p>— 吳吉人</p>
<p>吾帥正秋鄭先生之喪，於其懿行盛德，各報己不厭求詳的競載着，蓋棺論定，先生總不失為一位「好好先生」。假如說：壽算是有主宰的話，那簡直是做好人天還要來見妬的？</p>
<p>小子從民十六那年踏進了電影界。因為，担任的職位是很微來的，而先生以協理之尊，竟會獨具只眼的來提携我，照拂我，有時還很懇切的來鼓勵我，看樣子是很蒙期許的，可是在我，說也慚愧，「同學少年都不賤」。我還不是依然的故我嗎？迄今思之，深負了先生的一番美意。自己也太不長進了。</p>
<p>前年，先師王梅癯先生之喪，曾有長文哭之，說也可憐，一位敎誨諄諄的良導師，纔心喪不久，而為認為畢生知己之感的一位正秋先生，又會在四五天的急病中羽化了。頻年哭母哭師，聯接而來，我生不辰，我命多乖，言之亦殊覺神愴心痛也。</p>
<p>這些年來，正秋先生不時有文仰方面的事務相囑託，所以有時亦常詣崇階，追侍杖履，說理談道，獲益匪鮮，關於先生的史實，也曾經吿訴給我聽見不少。</p>
<p>……『在淸末「民立報」極盛時代，因為自幼就喜歡寫稿子，投登各報，忽然有一天被于右任先生來招呼了去談話，並委以担任編輯民立報的本埠版，從此就走上了新聞事業的一條途徑。隨後寫「麗麗所」劇評，得到了廣大讀者的信心，館方又請專輯戲劇版，也就因票戲而走上了戲劇階梯。從評劇而演劇，再從演京劇而跨進了話劇界，覺得話劇的力量，比較京劇可以普遍，可以深入人心，借以宣揚文化，鼓吹革命，收效是遠大的，所以，雖化過很大的一筆家產，來救垂絕的話劇，居然會「毀家紓難」地把話劇來重振一下，項城當國時代，曾經在漢口演鼓吹革命劇而被捕過，向來，服膺先總理的主義的，但，說也有人不信，至今沒有加入過黨籍呢。演了好幾年的話劇，聞風景從的後輩，都情願拜做老師，約來有一千餘人，電影勃興，於是擺脫演劇生活而專任編劇導演職務了。』……</p>
<p>可見得先生的道德文章，為人稱重不休了，至於先生為文，雖不能囿之於繩墨，而一種橫溢的天才，聰敏的頭腦，別說沒有人比得上他，即老師宿儒，也要自嘆弗如，不敢與之抗衡，先生的思想，確實有獨到的地方，論資格，可以愧煞鍍金的博士，却連什麼學堂也沒有進過，那他淸新的頭腦，是人們所不可及的。</p>
<p>先生好藝養金魚，得暇也時常去看看小秋兄所飼養的十幾缸金魚兒的，頻年，望孫心切，新正欣獲麟孫，含飴之樂，自多愉快，太夫人高堂尙在，先生事之甚孝，同堂四世，怡怡洩洩。</p>
<p>先生體素弱，而今年入夏，看他精神不差，不過，失眠症是得了好久了。上月問，許多養魚同志，成立了一個「中國藝魚社」，先生亦居於發起人之列，十日晚上，假座冠生園舉行同志餐叙，先生同文郎小秋欣然蒞止，餐畢，且與朱大可先生及不佞互商重創一個魚園的事宜，很想恢復「魚樂」之議，先生且獨任鉅欵來促成這一個集團，那里會曉得歸去就腹瀉不止，繼之以吐，我十二那天同陳幼臣先生到蘇州去，隔晚，先生尙以蘇產「松子雲片糕」，及「鮮蓮子」兩物委購，又安能知我十四夜車抵滬，而詰朝光生的去世惡耗已竟由茶役跑來通知了呢！驚聞大慟，更從何處覓「返魂香」呢？</p>
<p>先生的喪，吊者送者，何止三千人，而一般迷影的觀衆，又一定要追念他遺傳下來的偉大貢獻的呢！</p>
<p>心喪之餘，挽以一聯為殿，聯日。</p>
<p>小草荷深培，相看何止忘年友。</p>
<p>遊魚驚失水，私慟誰為援手人。</p>
<p>自覺尙的當，巳塗就致送矣。畢生知遇，一旦永訣，嗚呼，噫嘻。傷哉。</p>

<h3 id="c164">介紹鎮江農村護士學校 <a href="#c164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— 殷金泉</p>
<p>我國自古以來，號稱以農立國，農民占倒數百分之八十五以上，當然復興農村，爲治理的急務。目今在多數人的口號中，時常的顧慮着農村破産，然欲解悶這個問題，必須先明瞭是些甚麽原因？這個原因，委實太複雜，我們站在衛生的立塲看來，農村衛生事業的不普及，對於農村破産，占有重大的原因，故應積極的建設衛生事業；今明到是辦理農村衛生事業，一定需要許多有訓練的，能刻苦耐勞的人才來幹，然在衛生事業幼稚到極點的我國，衛生人才委實太缺乏，所以欲救濟農村衛生事業，必須造就一班鄉村生長的衛生人才（農村護士）方爲功。在這貧病交迫科學醫師缺乏的今日農村中，這種農村護士學校的創辦，無論在衛生事業的改進，新醫的前途，都有提倡的必要，茲特鈄鎮江農村護士學校的概況，略述於後，以供我國注意農村衛生事業諸位參考：</p>
<p>前年秋季，冷禦秋，張翼雲等紳士，以衛生事業普及到農村去的需要，及農村破産請不起醫師的事實，在農村醫師缺乏的環境中，創辦了農村護士學校，設於鎮江弘仁醫院內，卒業以後，叫他們到缺乏衛生知識，請不起醫師，疾病救治，宣傳衛生教育，及指導民衆衛生等工作，以資救濟，故取名爲農村護士學校。</p>
<p>該校因爲試辦，所以招生限於鎮江縣的範圍，由各區區長，選擇在鄉村生長的優秀份子兩名，經考試合格，方得入校學習。他們恐怕招了一班少爺式的人來，訓練後不能應用，所以在招考時最注重的，是有刻苦耐勞的精神；因爲在鄉村生長的，才知道鄉村的情形和痛苦，將來才願熱心的若幹。</p>
<p>農村護士的訓練方法是（一）訓育方面：該校訓育的目標，爲「勤」，「儉」，凡學生應做的事，總叫他們去做，凡可以省儉的地方，總要設法叫他們省儉，極力的避免都市化，如此卒業後，方能服務鄉村。（二）教育方面：該校所教授的方式，是學後即實習，使得地一步的了解，第一學年補充普通科學，其後半年讀書，半年實習，使學後都能應用，所授之科目，爲解剖學，生理學，細菌學，飲食學，繃帶學，護士倫理學，公共衛生學，一般護病學，內科護病學，外科護病學，眼科護病學，泌尿生死科護病學，皮膚科護病學，兒科護病學，精神病護病學，家庭護病學，黨義，國文，數學，化學，物理學，植物學動物學，外國文等等；各科應用之書籍，隨事實之需要另定之。</p>
<p>以上所論，乃該校的概況，我們仔細的想一想，在這衛生幼稚到極點，科學醫師缺乏而不願到鄉村去，農民找不到醫師治療的狀況中，這咱人才實可以疾病，減少農民的痛苦；同時可以普及衛生教育，使人民信仰科學醫藥的先鋒，我以爲農村護士，頗切合救濟農村衛生事業之需要。</p>

<p>（六十一）神經性腸閂患和黏液疝痛</p>
<p>（問）什麽叫做神經性腸疾患？</p>
<p>（答）這是腸管實質並無什麽變化，而無端起疝病或泄瀉等腸症狀的疾病。有知覺性，運動性和分泌性腸神經症的區別。</p>
<p>（問）知覺性腸神經症是怎樣的？</p>
<p>（答）知覺性腸神經症，大都是腸痙鑾的併發症狀。</p>
<p>（問）起什麽現象？</p>
<p>（答）病人忽發疝瘡，在鉛中毒時往往見的。也有發作絞腸痛，在動脈感化症時常見的。又有起腸發作性疼痛，在脊體癆（梅毒）時屢屢遇到的。</p>
<p>（問）運動性腸神經症是怎樣的？</p>
<p>（答）運動性腸神經證，病人起腸的蠕動不安，尤其是不腸部，這是在神經質者發現的。又有起一定的便秘，痙鑾性腸壅塞，神經性泄瀉，反射性泄瀉等。這是在婦人或男子攝護腺病時見的。世有起精神的泄瀉，肛門括約肌痙鑾等。這是在肛門裂傷時或患痔瘡時見的。</p>

<h3 id="c166">毛地黃葉與心臟病 <a href="#c166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— 丹祺</p>
<p>醫學故事之五</p>
<p>現在，一般醫藥界都承認，毛地黃的葉子是療治心臟病的特效藥。它怎樣被人採用作藥，是一個富於趣味和教訓的故事。在一本於一七八五年出版的美麗的小冊子中，我們發見善於這故事的早期歷史記載。這小冊子的作者名叫佛受林（William　Wirboring），是當時英國柏明罕地方一個醫學博士，具有天賦的堅忍的毅力與健全的頭腦。</p>
<p>在這本小冊子（書名是：An　Acc　unt　of　the　Foxglore　and　Some　of　its　Medicil　Usee:with　Practical　Remarks　on　Dropsy　and　　Other　Disenses、）中，佛受林詳細記錄毛地黃葉被採用作藥的來歷。毛地黃是蕃植於鞏固兩部又冷又潮濕的氣候與土壤中的一種夏季草本植物。佛受林早先曾聽到過：西　休地方一個老婦人能用一種杜煎的藥茶療治水腫。他真實以爲這不過是不可靠的謠言，只有那些輕信的人們纔會相們。後來，他親眼看到一個患水腫的病人，在羣醫束手之後，給這老婦人用秘製的藥茶治愈了，纔引起他探究與實驗的決心。</p>
<p>事情的經過是這樣的。牛津勃來西諾斯大學的校長患水腫病，遍請良醫診治。他們都不能使他的病狀減輕，於是他的遑急的阇眷屬建議請那西洛休的老婦人來診治他的病。在無可奈何的形勢之下，他喝了幾碗那老婦人給他的藥茶。果然，他的水腫完全消退了。</p>
<p>這就是使佛受林決心探究的一個眼見的事實。他的第一步工作求得那藥茶的方劑。這當然不是容易的。那老婦人恃此爲生，那裏肯洩漏她的秘密。但佛受林用盡方法——據說是用重金賄買的——終於把那方劑得到了。</p>
<p>他發見這方劑含有多種草藥；根據他的藥物知識，他斷定期中最重要的只是毛地黃的要這一味草藥。他雙試驗：毛地黃的莖，葉，或花是否比它的根更有效騐。試驗的方法當然是叫病人分別服用。根據試驗的結果，他斷定毛地黃葉是治水腫最有效的部分。他繼續決定藥劑的分配，用藥的步驟。他說，當病人服膊變得均勻而且緣慢的時候，或當病人起胸惡與作嘔的進修，用藥就可以停止了。</p>
<p>讓我們來辨別佛受林的知識和西洛休老婦人的知識的不同吧。佛受林的的貢獻，代表任何藥物知識進步的第二步。那老婦人只知道，用某種方法制成的藥茶是有利於病的。她嚴守從早留傳下來的一定的方劑，不知變異，不加試驗。佛受林卻這麽辦。他求得那一味草藥是方劑中最重要的，求得這草藥的那一部分是最有功效的，求得服用藥物最適當的分量，求得服用藥物的最適宜的步驟。換一句話，就是，他使這藥物的服用合理化。但他的知識仍然是不完全的，他毫不明瞭病的性質。他決不想到這藥物會作用於心臟。他不知道心臟的精細的解剖——那時候是沒有人知道的。這是不足怪的，因爲那時候適用的複雜的顯微鏡尚未發明，因此動物組織是細胞組成，每一細胞各具一定的化學反應，這學理尚無人想到。毛地黃的藥理得完全明瞭，還須經過一百餘年間醫藥知識的進步。</p>
<p>那麽，毛地黃時療治心臟病的真實情形究竟是怎樣的呢？心臟的跳動是一種收縮的波浪，這波浪的開始於心臟的上部——即心耳，向下部——即心室——移動。波浪所經過的軌道是一小束肌肉和神經組織——叫做「希斯束（Bundle　of　His）。當心臟病起來的時候，心耳便起振動。心耳的振動這麽迅速地經過「希斯束」，至於驅出備注的心室反應得很不現則而且很不靈活。於是實際流動着的備注的分量大大減少，血液便積聚在血管裏，這就是水腫病的起因。毛地黃葉含有一處化學成分，當希斯束吸收了這化學成分的時候，一種化學作用發生，結果使它不受心耳振動的響應，間接也就保護心室，使脈搏重又平均，血液重又活動。停聚的血液既然流通，水腫自然消退了。</p>

<p>（五十六）臭鼻症（續）</p>
<p>（二）痂地的形成　本病患者的鼻腔內。常可形成痂塊。這種痂塊是由膿性分泌物乾燥而成的。我們用鼻鏡檢査鼻腔。則見鼻腔異常廣闊。牠的各壁。皆有汚穢灰白色或帶綠色的膿痂附着。膿痂的表面。非常乾固。而帶惡臭如將膿痂除去。則見萎縮瘦削的粘膜。</p>
<p>（三）鼻腔粘膜的萎　縮鼻腔的粘膜。大都萎縮瘦削。而呈蒼白色。與骨質强固癒若。不易剁離。萎縮最顯著的部分。多係下甲介。此時若行前鼻鏡檢査。則易由前窺視鼻咽腔的後壁。這是因爲甲介的粘膜。已經萎縮瘦削。鼻腔異常廣閙的原故。</p>
<p>此外本病可足注意的。就是鼻的外形。多爲扁平。患者往往感覺鼻閉塞，嗅覺脫失，頭痛，頭重，消化不良，咽頭亁燥，精神不振，及缺少樂趣等等。</p>
<p>本病的合併症。有乾性咽頭炎，中　加答兒，及化膿性中耳炎等。有時可以併發副鼻腔的化膿。有時炎症能經鼻漠管而蔓延於眼窩。</p>
<p>講到臭鼻症的療法。最緊要的就是（第一）必須設法排除痂塊的形成。（第二）力使分泌物的劇臭消滅。（第三）希望治瘉鼻膜粘膜及骨質的萎縮。但是事實上對於這一層是很困難的。（第四）探求本病的原因而加治療。（第五）增强全身的營養。（第六）同時治療合併而來的各種症候。所以牠的療法。可以分爲局部療法，原因療法，及全身療法。局部療法中有鼻腔灌洗法，葛氏棉栓法，鼻粘腔震顫按摩法，葵液塗布法，藥粉吹撒法，電氣分析法，鬰血療法及粘膜下巴剌汾注射法等等。原因療法必須確定病原後。始可施行適當的療法。「伐克辛」療法最近亦有確實奏效的報告。大可試用。至於全身療法中之最屬有效的，就是內服或注射魚肝油或維他命製劑</p>

<p>第二編　淋病</p>
<p>臨床上。分自尿道外口至球部後之外括約筋。曰前尿道。自膜樣部，攝護腺部至內括約筋，曰後尿道</p>
<p>二，女子之尿道及陰道</p>
<p>子，尿道　女子尿道。遙較男子者爲淺短平直。其構造亦較簡單。惟在外尿道口之後緣。通常有二細管。卽所謂司肯氏腺（Shenesche　Druesen）。此細管易於感染初期之淋菌。</p>
<p>丑，陰道　陰道旣爲交接所在。則其臨床上之意義。自較他部爲要。按陰道爲有擴張性之管道。富於皺襞。其上端擁子宮頸。下端開口於外陰部。卽陰道口也。在陰道口之左右側有前庭球（Bulbi　vestibuli）。此與男子之海綿體相當。在陰道入口之周圍。有無數粘腋腺。曰小前庭腺（Glandnla　Vestibularis　minor）。在前庭球之後端。有大前庭腺。卽巴托里尼氏腺（BartboliRische　Druesen）也。</p>
<p>陰道位於膀胱及尿道之後。直賜之前。受子宮陰逍部。而始於陰道穹窿（Fo　nixvaginae）。前陰道壁與尿道壁密着。其組織互相愈合。後陰道壁與直腸前壁相密切地愈着。此與男子尿道。大異其趣。蓋在男子。其尿道與直腸之關係。不呈愈着之狀態也。</p>
<p>第五章　淋病之一般經過及其症状</p>
<p>第一節　淋病之一般經過</p>
<p>甲，淋病經過之程序</p>
<p>淋病之經過。可分爲急性及慢性兩種。一般。當感染後之二三日。其病勢只限局於淺表的外尿道口及其附近。此時淋菌之侵襲。只在粘膜之表面。至二週左右。則病勢進行。達全盛時期。此時之病變。侵及粘膜深部。淋菌之數目。亦遙較初期爲多矣。急性淋菌性前尿道炎之經過——如卽請醫治。經過良好。每至三四週之終而諸症漸殺。但普通於前尿道炎發生後之二三週間。及波及於後尿道。特別以過度之運運，性交，勃起，遺精，刺戟性飮食物之飮用爲誘因。或以探尿管，導尿管及患者不留意的注入藥物。而誘發急性淋菌性後尿道炎。</p>
<p>急性淋病經過之後。患者如以攝生之不注意。治療之中止。或醫治之不得其宜。則以病菌未滅。分泌未减。更侵淫於粘膜下組織及有關係之腺體，及附近之臟器。此時藥劑之作用綦難。故在長期之經過中。或發或止。尤以勞勁，飮酒，性交等不攝生之結果。再發念性症狀者有之。至於侵犯腺體及附近臟器而發副尿道炎，尿道周圍浸潤，柯氏腺炎，攝護腺炎，精囊炎，副睪丸炎，膀胱炎，腎盂炎等。不一而足。在女子。以解剖上生理上之關係。更有司肯氏腺及巴托里尼氏腺炎。及直腸炎等之發生。</p>
<p>抑有言者。淋菌。尙能由血行或淋巴行而轉移於遠處。惹起淋菌性炎症。最多者爲關節。次腱鞘。其他如心內膜，骨，筋肉，神經，中耳，腹膜，肋膜及心囊等。亦有轉移之可能。</p>

<p>毒瘤痛</p>
<p>在歐美科學進步的國家，因科學醫之普遍與公共衛生行政之完善，普通死亡率已有顯著的降低，例如佔死亡率最高的癆病已降到第幾位。急性傳染病中最可怖的霍亂症現已等於絕跡。作者旅美七年餘從未目覩耳聞一霍亂症發現。再如死亡率很髙的傷寒症現在也减去百分之九十五以上。其餘如直接傳染病與嬰兒死亡率也都降到極低。科學醫效力之偉大實在使人驚異，其造福於人羣也不能算小。</p>
<p>人民年紀之高低與死亡率成反比例，卽死亡率髙人民之享壽低，死亡率低人民之享壽髙。歐美科學醫最發達的國家人民平均的壽數已達到五十餘歲，較之我國人民平均之壽數已超過一倍。由於人民年齡增高之結果同時反有一種死亡率突飛猛進，令人可怕，且科學醫也幾失去效能。這種病是什麽，卽毒瘤症（各種癌與惡性腫瘤）。各種毒瘤與人民之年紀成正比例，卽老年人越多生毒瘤的人也越多，故癌爲老年人的大仇敵。怎麽講科學翳對於這一頻病也幾失落數用呢？其意義卽各種毒瘤都是可以致患者於死地的，科學醫除了於生毒瘤的初期可以挽救外，其餘稍晚便完全不能挽救。所以一個人患毒瘤一入於較重的境地就等於定了死刑，全世界醫家完全束手無策。現在各國每年都耗費大批金錢以研求挽救晚期毒瘤的方法，但還未見到顯著的成效。至於將來能否完全成功現在沒有人能講。毒瘤的原因現在還不十分淸楚也必須繼續研究。</p>
<p>毒瘤分爲兩大類，第一類佔最大部分的是癌，佔較小部分的是毒肉瘤。身體最平常生癌的部分如下：胃，婦女乳房，子宮，子宮頸，卵巢腺男女大腸，直腸，面部等。現在治毒瘤的方法是：初期的毒瘤可以割去，或用銑（鐳錠），或用電燒，或用愛克司光照，且有把握可以治愈。較嚴重的毒瘤照以上各法洽也沒有把握。晚期的毒瘤因可以轉移到身體別部分故無法挽救。毒瘤的危險就是由於轉移性。</p>

<p>第六節　腎臟結核</p>
<p>本症預後的推測，是狠難下堅决斷語的；但幷非决對不良，如往日一般之所料對於潰瘍的狀態，也並非毫無辦法。有時因經過人工氣胸手術，咳嗽和痰唾的减少，喉部疾患，也因以發生轉愈狀態的。至於肺結核症本身如何？進行至何種程度？病者的一般狀態等種種，和本症的預後，都是有密切關係的。</p>
<p>除開喉結核症外，鼻結核症也可時見着的；不過遠沒有前者之衆多罷了！他的症象旣不甚多，治療也沒有可特殊提出的地方，所以此處也一概省去不談了</p>
<p>腎臟結核爲局部結核，性病變之一種：他是大半發生稚肺結核症以後的，關於他的構成的原始，是從血管系統方面蔓延而致的；這一種情形，在前面第四章裏面已經叙述過了！他在腎臟裏面，最初是發生乾酪性病變，這是大半限於腎臟上面一部分的：此種亁酪狀病變，如果崩壞了，也可以構成空洞狀態，和肺部的情形一樣的。此外，像病灶周圍發生結締組織，以致呈痊愈狀熊，和石灰性硬化，都屬可能之列的。甚至有時候因之發生尿道完全閉塞狀態的。</p>

<p>一　題前幾句傷心話</p>
<p>農業經濟之破產，在中國已經普遍化，任何一省都脫不了這個漩渦；有的地方，因為穀物收穫量增加，消費市塲又狹小，致形成「穀賤傷農」的現象；有的地方，是因為農產物歉收，致榖物價格飛漲，形成空前未有的米荒；有的地方，幾年來都無收成，整千萬的農民度那流離於載道生死顚沛的日子。故中國農業經濟崩潰的事實，無論「富甲天下」的浙粵是如此，「豐年不溫飽」的山西甘肅也是如此，大概已到了山窮水盡的地步了。</p>
<p>要知道：這些現象之來，造成中國農村所以破產的原因，可以歸根到如下的三點：</p>
<p>（一）國際帝國主義之無饜的淺酷的榨取與壓迫；</p>
<p>（二）國內封建勢力各式各樣的剝與戕害；</p>
<p>（三）嚴重的天災威脅與破壞。</p>
<p>第一，二兩項暫且不說；高喊着「復興農村」「救濟農村」的今年，前面所說的致命傷之一的天災消息，也是紛紛地從各省各縣傳來：長汪的水患巳經開始襲擊沙市漢口及長江上游一帶，最近晴了幾天，稍微緩和他的威脅，然而巳有說，如民國二十年的大水患一般。至於華北各省如河北山東山西，在今年仍然逃不了水患的，黃河又衝毀了堤岸，决口之水，說有借運奪淮的趨勢；而浙閩粵桂諸省，又無不遭受了相當水害，可云，去年是大旱年，今年是大水年了，這樣的水早災荒不絕而來，也就可知中國農業經濟，是如何地加速的破產了。</p>
<p>以上算是本文的楔子。</p>
<p>二　且看「災荒之國」</p>
<p>說到中國的災荒，是有着很深遠的歷史。</p>
<p>原來，有人說過，中國是個「災荒之國」（Land　of　Famine）據通志及績通志的所載，自春秋時魯桓公之年起，至明末崇禎十四年止，單就水災及旱災兩項而論，即有一千三百廿三年之多；而一年中發生數次者，還未計算在內。此外如蝗災風災雹災虫災，地震以及種種的災害，尙未算入。假如計算在內，其數字更足驚人了。淸代二百六十四年中間，年年都有災荒：自順治三年（一六四四年）至宣統三年（一九一一年），每年平均約有六十縣被災，佔全國十八省縣百分之三·七三（按十八省共一六〇七縣）。據瑪勒利（Walter　Mallory）所著「中國之災荒」（China，Land　of　Famine）一書，他按照每次飢荒達到的範圍做成一個表。這個表都是根據中國人寫的歷史上的材料。據他統計，由紀元前六二〇到一九〇〇年，在中國共有包括整個幾省的災荒，一千五百〇六次，因此中國可稱為一個「災荒之國」。</p>
<p>在歷史上是有着斑斑的紀載，我們不用說了。就以最近數年的事實來說吧：然而最近數年——中國經濟總破產的現在，每年又何嘗不是在災荒的掙扎之下呢？若言災荒的種類，則有水早，螟蝗，猛獸，野鼠，風霜，冰雹，地震；山崩，疫癘，大火等項；若言災荒的範圍，則遍及於二十五省以上；若言災荒的程度，最甚者如民國十七年至二十年之西北旱災，赤地遍於千里以上，死亡輒以萬計，餓莩載道，閭里為空；二十年之十六省水災，江淮流城，人畜田廬多被淹滅，土地多被冲沒，致地方元氣，非經過長時期不易恢復。據賑務委員會民國十七年至二十年之災况調查而綜核之：計民國十七年全國被災之縣二百有三，與全國之一千九百三十六縣比較，則居百分之十又四；民國十八年全國被災之縣驟增至八百四十一縣；二十年被災之縣，則有五百十九縣；二十一年可說是災荒較輕的一年，然而吉林，黑龍江，山西和雲南等省的水災，陝西積年的水，早，風，雹，黑霜各災，及河北的各河决口，江西的先水後旱，災荒亦有七省之多；其中災情較重的為吉林，黑龍江，山西和陝西四省。據南滿鐵道株式會社的調查報吿，吉黑兩省耕地全面積之八成，完全為大水所淹沒，農產物所受的損失，佔經年總收獲量百分之七十以上。山西受水災的縣份為六十八縣，陝西所受冰，雹，風各災的縣份，則有九十餘縣，惟損失缺乏統計。至民國二十二年的災荒，其災區的廣大，災情的嚴重，雖沒有如民國二十年大水災之來，但蝗災一項的災害，也就狠嚴重的了。據申報年鑑的報吿：二十二年中的災荒震動全國，河南，山東，河北，江蘇，陝西受黃河水災的，計有五十三縣以上；他如湖南，湖北，安徽，浙江，江西，河北，貴州的水災（黃河水災不在內），湖南，河南，陝西，湖北，甘肅，江西，福建，四川，靑海的匪災；河南，陝西，安徽，貴州的風災；河南，陝西，安徽，貴州，江蘇的雹災；河南，陝西的霜災，其他如地震，鼠投亦波及陝甘各省。至蝗災一項，在二十二年亦有十省之廣，若以縣位計，則有二百三十一縣之多。總共二十二年各項災情，全國計被災有四百七十六縣。這些事實，一言以蔽之整個的中國都是在災荒的威脅之下。若再加以帝國主義及封建勢力的各種剝削關係，愈益增加了對農民之自然力的迫害吧了。假如我們不會抹殺事實，當然會見到成千萬的農夫農婦，還有他們病老的父母和稚弱的兒女，悽慘的哀呼，絕呌，嚎哭，飢啼，在死亡線上掙扎着！過去如是，現在如此，未來的事實能否不如此？</p>
<p>三　去年災荒之一斑</p>
<p>以往的災荒是如此，且看最近的一年！民國二十三年吧！關於早災的統計，據最近實業部中央農業實驗所的農情報吿（第二年九—十一期）被災省份及田畝，可摘錄如下表：（單位千畝）</p>
<p>表一：二十三年中國各省早災統計表</p>
<p>省名　原有田畝　被災田畝　百分比</p>
<p>江蘇　九一、五八三　四九、四五五　五四</p>
<p>浙江　四一、一一三、　二一、七九〇　五三</p>
<p>安徽　五三、六六二　三七、〇二七　六九</p>
<p>山東　二〇一、五〇五　三八、五七二　三八</p>
<p>河南　一〇四、五七八　三八、六九四　三七</p>
<p>湖南　四二、二四五　二二、三八九　五三</p>
<p>湖北　五六、二二三　一七、九九一　三二</p>
<p>江西　三八、一三五　一八、三〇五　四八</p>
<p>河北　九五、六〇三　五七、三六二　六〇</p>
<p>山西　五六、六二七　一四、六〇三　二六</p>
<p>陝西　三〇、七二二　一三、八二五　四五</p>
<p>總計　七二、九九三　三三〇、〇一三　四六</p>
<p>至於水災，去年也很嚴重，據賑務委員會民國二十三年各省災情報吿表中所列，可摘錄如下表：（千畝為單位）</p>
<p>表二：二十三年中國各省水災統計表</p>
<p>省名　被災縣數　原有田畝　被災田畝　百分比</p>
<p>湖北　三　六一、〇一〇　五、二六六　九</p>
<p>湖南　三〇　四五、六一二　一、三九　三</p>
<p>河南　二八　二四、七五四　八、三七五　七</p>
<p>河北　三一　一〇三、四三二　五、七四七　六</p>
<p>山西　二九　六〇、五六〇　一、二八三　二</p>
<p>陝西　三〇　三三、四九六　一、四九一　五</p>
<p>四川　三七　九六、二七二　三四五　〇·四</p>
<p>安徽　二　三五、五二　八八六　二</p>
<p>江西　一八　四一、六三〇　二、三〇四　六</p>
<p>綏遠　一三　二〇、九六四　四、八二八　二四</p>
<p>福建　一九　二三、五八一　一、五三四　七</p>
<p>察哈爾　八　一七、二四三　一二八　一</p>
<p>總計　二六六　六二七、〇六五　三三、四〇六　五</p>
<p>附註：山東十縣，貴州十二縣，因無田畝數，未列入，</p>
<p>從上表觀來，二十三年全國被水災省僅有十二省，實際上當不僅此，如山東省的黃河水災，並無詳確的統計，這都是不完全的。但是，我們從這些不完全的統計報吿看來，也就可以知道二十三年因被早災水災的田畝，共有三萬六千三百四十一萬九千餘畝之多了！要知道，被災田畝的增加，即是荒地的加增，亦即是農作物的損失。</p>
<p>四　一幅災民圖</p>
<p>總之，這些事實都是農村經濟破產現象之反映。假如我們不會抹殺這些事實的話，然當會目擊到「餓俘載道」「饑人相食，死者過半」的種種事實了！</p>
<p>在這裏，我們可以介紹一幅數千萬人悽慘的絕呌，嚎哭，饑餓的圖書。據賑務委員會調查河南，江蘇，廣東等十四省，因天災人禍而流離之災民，總數竟達六五，六六五，一七〇人之多。這種驚人的數目，正說明了中國社會組織所潛伏着的憂患，其統計表如下：</p>
<p>表三：最近各地流亡災民估計</p>
<p>省別　災民人數</p>
<p>河北　四、一六一、〇〇〇人</p>
<p>河南　一三、一一六、一一五人</p>
<p>湖南　六、四〇〇、〇〇〇人</p>
<p>湖北　九、〇〇〇、〇〇〇人</p>
<p>江西　六、〇〇〇、〇〇〇人</p>
<p>江蘇　六、五五二、〇〇〇人</p>
<p>浙江　三、〇〇〇、〇〇〇人</p>
<p>安徽　六、六七四人（註）</p>
<p>陜西　五、五八四、五二六人</p>
<p>甘肅　四、七五〇、〇〇〇人</p>
<p>山西　　二，一〇三、〇一三人</p>
<p>山東　四、一〇六、〇一三人</p>
<p>四川　二、五九八、八〇六人</p>
<p>廣州　三二九、九四六人</p>
<p>注：僅有安慶蕪湖兩縣報吿，其他未列入，</p>
<p>以上統計，災民總數六千五百餘萬人，不僅偽天災，人禍亦在其內，假如上列總計，再將最近年來災荒中的災民紙目包括在內，至少中國的災民有一萬萬之多。要知道：這一萬萬受天災人禍而離開農村的人，再加上了帝國主義及封建勢力的各種剝削關係，那麽受此種迫害的農民，又不知有多少？</p>
<p>然而這些現象，正表明了中國農村經濟之崩潰，巳是無可疑義的了。在這種情况之下徬徨在生死綫上的農民，自然很容易跑上一挺而走險」的道路上去，如搶米吃大戶便是他們的掙扎方法；這種掙扎方法，自然是「最原始的方法」，然而除此以外又怎樣呢？據中闕經濟情報社所作統計（中國經濟情報二卷二三兩期），去年（二十三年）搶米吃大戶風潮已經蔓延到七省二十八縣，計有六十四次，其統計表如下：</p>
<p>表四：二十三年各地農民搶米吃大戶</p>
<p>統計表</p>
<p>縣新次數</p>
<p>四川　五　五</p>
<p>安徽　四　四</p>
<p>江蘇　一一　一九</p>
<p>浙江　一三　二八</p>
<p>縣數次數</p>
<p>廣東　二　二</p>
<p>陝西　一　三</p>
<p>河南　二　三</p>
<p>合計　三八　六四</p>
<p>在這個情况之下，又如何談「救災」呢？總之，中國的災荒問題，還不是災荒與不災荒的問題，而還是中國的問題啊！即使災荒的問題解决了，中國的問題依然不能解决。過去的事實巳經是過去了，這一幅流民的圖畫依然存在着，假如此種自然力之迫害在今年更將加緊，如目前長江和黃河水災之齊頭而來，縱然不將這些成千萬的災民葬諸魚腹，也是會在這幅流民的圖畫上更加塗上一層濃厚的顏色了！</p>
<h3 id="c172">舊式簿記淺說 <a href="#c172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— 王宏經</p>
<p>一，槪論</p>
<p>簿記者，記貨物或金錢之出入，所有明存欠，詳盈虧也。故式無論新舊，法無別中西，率以簡明為主。蓋惟明，能少錯誤而杜弊寳，亦惟簡，方便查核而省人工。斯事視之似易，為之實難。初學者，若非算術珠算均有根底，恒不能豁然貫通；若僅知其然，—照樣畫葫蘆，而不明其所以然，每致其所以然，每致人為簿記支配，而不能支配簿記，因　損及營業者有之，是不可不愼也。</p>
<p>二，類別</p>
<p>西式簿記，有單式，及複式之分。舊式簿記，無專有名稱，茲為叙述容易明瞭起見；姑命舊式之最簡而明者，日龍門四柱式。龍門云者，流水賬每日績碼分原存，共入，共出，實存四項。而實存與現金恰相適合也。（設有抹零等舉，當另根存記之。）四柱云者，卽別存欠兩方為舊管，新收，開除，實在，四項，所以明盈虧也。屬於存者曰舊管，資本及欠入者屬之。曰新收，凡號內盈餘賬根屬之。曰開除，號內虧損賬根及日用雜項等屬之。曰實在，凡人欠及現金存貨墊欵等項屬之。為審核明瞭，動用欵項，不至時感周轉不靈計，舊管，實在兩項，又應別類。舊管項內，可分為欠外，興欠內二種。欠內除資本外，如護本公債，或東西兩方，臨時或定期存欵等，均屬之。欠外則為臨時往來或定期借欵等屬之。實在亦分為內欠，與外欠兩種，內欠如東西兩方支用及存貨墊欵等，外欠如客號帮欠欵，臨時或定期放欵等屬之。質言之，舊管實在兩項，雖分數類，而某存應急付，某仔可緩付，某欠催之即至，某欠將成瞎賬，要均因事，因人而異，神而化之，端賴個人。茲為醒目起見，列表如下：</p>
<p>存款旣分四柱，興西式之貨借對照表，及損益計算書，恰相適合，茲擬中西結賑對照表於下：</p>
<p>三，系統</p>
<p>（甲）正系，簿記之根源曰流水。流水可分維錢流水，興貨流水，期貨流水，過賑流水數種，賑務忙時，貨流水可因整零而別，即整貨流水，零貨流水，或零賣貨流水，批發貨流水。錢流水可因貨幣種別而異，如大連錢商忙者，有鈔票流水，金票流水，小洋流水等。因流水而生關係者，曰往復，凡係貸借關係者，均登往復賬；往復賬可別為銀行號往復，客帮往復，借貸往復等。總之因事之繁簡，別賬簿之多寡，而名稱亦因事，因地，因習慣而異，未可一律也。曰老賬，號內之販運貨色，均登老賬，大別可分為現貨老賬，期貨老賬，零賣老賬，製造老賬，兌換老賬等，亦因地，因習慣，而名稱各異，至不一致也。曰雜項賑；號內支使，日用，公費，房租等，槪登雜項賑，俗所稱為使費賑也。</p>
<p>（乙）旁係　有單據留底，通信地　留底，應酬雜錄，職員人名錄，籍貫承保冊等名目，要亦因事之繁簡，別賬之多寡也。總之不因事繁而缺略，不因求詳明，而多置不事生產之職員，則是矣。</p>
<p>四，使用</p>
<p>（甲）抄賬凡收付欵項，進出貨物，均先登流水賬。而後由抄賬員，分類抄寫於往復賬，或老賬上。每筆抄訖，點長點於流水賑上之名別右肩。流水賑上，收付亮相，用入出二字代職。往復，或老賑，則用來去二字代之，而冠月日於其上。同月不用重寫，同日則寫又字；惟隔頁，或隔面時，則宜另冠月日，以期醒目。事忙之商號，恒憑單據，先抄往復賬，而識記號於單據上。流水記賬員，即憑單據出賬，點點可矣，小批批於幣名下之右旁，宜詳明。</p>
<p>（乙）對賬對賬，由非簿記員如學生意之聰敏者任之，包含使簿記員得休息的機會，與生眼容易看出錯誤，及防作弊，並使學生意者，有學習賬目之機會等項作用。間亦有時，由會計主任—又稱總賬桌，或執事等任之，所以示鄭重，防弊端也。方法係用抄對二印，由持流水賬握抄印者呼，而由持往復或老賬握對印者諾，相合後，一蓋抄印於入出之上，一蓋對印於來去之月日上。</p>
<p>（丙）按根一按根，衛語又日按灘，即每一往來容號，各設一賑根是也。對外川往按設賑根，英將埠別，類別致跟同者，使之聚合於相近處，俾易檢查。假如有外埠往復與本埠往復二種賬簿。本埠往復，有華洋兩帮，應使洋商與華商各列集合於相近處。外埠往復有靑島烟台天津三埠，則應將各該埠商號，極合於相近處，蓋均為易於檢查計也。至同一商號有定期存欵，有往來透支，則又英因川往性質，而各別設立賑根。再如每一客號，因委辦來去貨物，次數甚多若碎使費，均彙集於往復賑啥是哪個，旣繁雜而又不清醒；應另在客帮載賑。每次各設一根，結束後，再過往復賬，旣易於劃算使費，而往復賑亦醒目矣。反之號內販賣大宗貨物，亦應各別設根，結果，其理亦如上述同也。號內零賣貨物，設矣總根，則混雜不淸，盈虧不明；各設根，又貨品繁多，事太瑣碎。最妙以品別！不以類別。即如麫中之紅日當天，與緣兵船等，可以混為一根。而粗布中之牧牛牌，與長城牌等，亦可混為一根也。為清醒計，最妙每筆編成號數，賣出時，於月日上，註明買時號數，而買時之號數，則旁註某號賣出若干件，某號賣出若干件，貨淸，而旁註亦恰合買數矣。</p>
<p>（丁）結賬，（一）關於流水者！流水分原存，共入，共出，實存，四項，而實存必須與相合，若有錯誤，除漏記，應添入，或添，設有誤記，應來去對占，萬部可改賑，切記，切記。實存與現金恰合，而後結之，遂書翌日月日於其後，防遺漏也。（二）關於往復，或老賬者，除市面川往家，當日貨來欵去，每逢月底，將來去共計確數，書蘇碼於來去月日下，兩淸即可鈎勒外，其餘凡有存欠者，不論為存或欠，均應先結後淸，即最後結餘那筆，來去在結碼欠存外也。號內老賬，普通習慣，率以金錢為來去，而以貨物附之，故結碼時，除標明金錢存欠外，當批註貨物存欠數目，而使與實存貨物相合。最妙將餘存貨物，均價若干，一一註明尤善。若欵來貨去，貨去欵來，個別登記者，（盈虧除外）應各別結存，結欠，固無論矣。</p>
<p>（戊）單據，（一）批貨定單，貸借契據，均因地因習慣而異，有成文可按，總以文理明顯清順為主。（二）單據而由流水往復生關係者，不外發票，往復淸單，成本單，利息單等，除流水，與往復，或老賬，批註應詳明外，而單據批註，以簡明為主。</p>
<p>（已）糾察，糾查二字，誠不易言。譬如大小相誤，應以九除，存欠相誤，當以二除等方法。</p>
<p>五，結論</p>
<p>（甲）簿記員之任用，薄記員，旣負使籌記明存欠，詳盈虧之任命，然則簿記員之物色培植，須審愼必矣。端謹木訥者，固便於顧指氣使，然木納者，必不能有所囊贊，有所建樹；活潑明敏，有餘力而能有所建樹者，又每不甘作機械式的生活，故或者抑之，或者伸之，踹賴乎主其事者，加以權衡，為號內培植一人才，誠非易事也。至利用木訥者之庸弱，或衰老者之無異志，而常使其任簿記員，不事調換者；錮人之智慧，弱人之體格，除聽使喚一項利益外，其少襄贊，少建樹，無形中損及營業者，恒得不償失，况居心不仁者乎？至若初出習商時，最妙作短時間簿記員，以明號內概况，此後則任別項職事，俾多方面學習，庶幸而担任重要職務時，不至僅嫻交際，而不諳賬略，以致計算不明敏，則良佳矣。</p>
<p>（乙）簿記員之監督，諺云；「用人不疑，疑人不用」，至言也。然雖用人不疑，而監督不可忽，若閱賬，若點櫃，若查證券，契據，均應定時舉行，對職員不應用機詐，又不應弄才智，質言之，示弱固不可，倨傲亦無甚用。必恩以結之，威以抑之，雖點者當必就範矣。</p>
<p>（丙）簿記員應有之修養，簿記員，責任繁重，使命重大，旣如右述。然則簿記員之修養，亦不可或忽。公餘事暇，當多讀書報，以增益見聞：多與外勤人員接談，以明市面情形；多活動，以减輕體胖，多笑談，以助長消化；不應以能盡厥職自滿，而當多學，多問，使有擢遷的機會，總之為飛黃騰達計，簿記員可暫為，而不可久為也，至任事時，不因勞多功少，而怨望，主管簿記員時，又能意有矜恤，氣量寬狹，固因人而異，要均當力謀恢宏也。此外如如何敦品勵行，以取他人信用，以供人支配時，則矢忠失誠，支配職員時，則開誠佈公，有非筆墨所能縷舉者，要均須平日修養有素，方能應付裕如也。世風不古，友道日淪，地北天南，能和衷共濟，協力同心，共營企業者日益鮮，致家族商業，日益形成，非佳兆也。蓋家族商業，父兄每因溺愛，而管敎不明，子弟亦因有倚賴，而倦勤，而不長進，反不若所謂江湖班者之監督嚴，工作緊張，少出弊端也。故肄習商業時，應遠離父兄，以宏自身之造就；經營商業時，應多用外籟人士，庶不至因愛惡而蔽賞罰，以收楚材晉用之效。然茲所論者，已軼簿記範圍之外矣。</p>

<h3 id="c178">評「娜拉」的演技 <a href="#c178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— 尤娜</p>
<p>自己剛出醫院不能走，兩位那居把我左扶有擁地拖到了金城大戲院，又遇着一些朋友把我拖呀拉地搬上了四層樓化妝室，主要演員都向我握手。</p>
<p>這回我特為是去看他們的演技，尤共是去賞鑑曾經給過我很深的印象的藍蘋。看後我總想寫一點感想，因病拿不起筆。直到前幾天我還是靠扶着拐捉，跛呀拐地到卡爾登看了「英雄與美人」，在我大滿意之下，很想發表一點意見，但終為病擱下了。漸漸看到報上對這兩次的公演，有各種好評，使我禁不住不得不說幾句話。</p>
<p>周達先生在大美晚報評「娜拉」說：……尤其是每各演員，能正確地表現劇中人物的個性，……這次演出的演技水準，是趕得上國際的演技藝術的最高水準。」我覺得周先生的批評，有點太籠統了；把國際的演技藝術的最高水準，看得太平常了。</p>
<p>以紅演員演易卜生底名「娜拉」，導演又十分盡力想使演出得到圓滿的結果，誠然，這次「娜拉」的演出，整個舞台的配置是很好的，演出技巧也有相當的成功，在最近的一些公演中，總算最成功的。若要比國際的演技藝術的最高水準，那是差得太遠了。是否達到國內演劇的最高地位，我看也難說。</p>
<p>去年黃金大戲院公演的「怒吼吧，中國！」的最後一塲，麥倫中學公演的「揚子江的暴風雨」及「走後的娜拉」第一二幕，又今年公演的「回春之曲」前兩幕，「水銀燈下」，不是演得很生動感人嗎？這次「娜拉」的演出，演技上果能超過以上的公演嗎？就是不久以前曁大公演的「油漆未乾」，個性的體貼和整個的緊凑，能亞於「娜拉」這次的演技嗎？</p>
<p>「娜拉」固然是很難演的，這次演技的缺點正多着。從飾娜拉的藍蘋女士說起——藍蘋去年演過「鎖着的箱子」她靈活的表演，有力的動作，尤其是眼睛慧敏又傳神，我認為是中國現在最搜長面部表演的女演員。</p>
<p>她這次飾娜拉，從有力一點說，的確不錯。但是，她有兩個最大的缺點，我們不能因為她大體還好，就把它忽略過去，正因為希望她對演劇技術有深邃的造詣，須要把她的缺點指出來。</p>
<p>第一個缺點是她表演愉快活潑時，很不自然，是免强做作的，做作得太瑣碎，平庸，非常缺欠大方氣，使人看了不起快感，那不是小為似的娜拉那末天眞活潑又可愛的個性的表現。</p>
<p>第二個缺點是她的力量太平板了，沒有高低階程的變換，她駡柯樂克時是那末兇而有力，等到發現了郝爾曼僅僅以玩具愛她，以至出走時的演出，還是同前面一樣的力量，她底力量停止在那同樣的階程中，到來後不能提高力量，沉痛剛毅地演出來，這是藍蘋女士的失敗。常娜拉借錢的事被丈夫發覺了，郝爾曼駡她是混賬的女人，這時娜拉該是怎樣驚愕，戰慄，而悲憤呢？可是藍蘋並沒有提高魄力，恰好地做到。出走時娜拉說：「我是一個人，我要敎育我自己，我要盡對於我自己的責任！」這些話該用多大的魄力說出來，表情又要極嚴肅而鎭靜，以顯示要保持她獨立人格的主張，藍女士在這裏却並沒有特別起勁的表演，只是一貫平淡的力量，那是不够的。又如此說：「世界上整千整萬的女子都為男子犧牲了名譽！」這話該用幽怨悲憤的聲調及表情，並且要十分嚴肅地處理這時候的舞臺空氣，藍女士並沒有深微地體騐到。再如：「我不相信不管女人的利害的法律，我要看看究竟是我錯了還是這世界全錯了？——世界全錯了！宗敎和法律，都是保護特殊利益的東西！」這段頂點的高潮，當用十全十足的反抗精神，嚴重沉毅地表演的，藍蘋在這裏到底把握到甚麼程度，給了觀衆很滿意否？我希望愛護藍女士底藝術的觀衆，應該不客氣地指出她在這段演得太沒有力，表情也不夠。</p>
<p>總之，藍女士這回的演技，比普通一般女演員是有力多多，也靈活地處理了舞台的地位。只可惜她的活潑太不自然，又氣燄洶洶，有時近於輕狂，缺少沉着和有節拍的動作；尤其她底力量，始終一貫是平板的調子，好像沒有最高及最低音階的鋼琴，彈不出高低緩急的曲調。但她是有希望的演員，希望她努力！</p>
<p>趙丹君飾郝爾曼，簡直不合個性，他的失敗是預料中的。他年齡太輕，身架又小，最好是演血氣方剛，堅毅有力的靑年。他飾中年紳士的郝爾曼，起碼就沒有紳士風，也拿不出丈夫架子，更不像深於事故的偽君子。當郝爾曼發現了妻的隱藏，怒不可當地自己揭開了偽君子的面具，赤裸裸地拋出那自私自利的面孔，為着自己底名譽，狠毒兇暴地痛駡娜拉，這是全劇轉變的關鍵，應該要怎樣體貼劇情，做出那可憎可惡的樣子？趙丹在這裏雖然很賣力，但並不見得可憎。等到債主退回了借據，那爾曼又想把妻子找回掌中來玩，這裏趙丹雖然做得頗可，但總像和小情人吵了架又來陪小心，不是在描寫紳士兼偽君子的郝爾曼的心理。</p>
<p>飾林頓夫人的吳湄女士，在第一幕那樣呆板無生氣，一點也不像在困苦中掙扎的女性，更看不出她是有商業知識的婦人，她那萎縮可憐相，簡直不像劇中人。後兩幕頗合寡婦的身分，但仍嫌呆板。</p>
<p>魏鶴齡先生飾的南開醫生，背太駝了，過於老氣衰頹，他那單戀的可憐的心理可算是表現得很好了，但他並沒有很成功，因為那怯懦可笑的情態，他不曾做到。這本是費力難討好的脚色，難演也難成功。吳玲女士飾侍女，神情未免太高貴。唯有金山演到優越的成功。</p>
<p>這些話也許是在白璧中求瑕，但以嚴肅的態度來說演技藝術，又覺得不得不這樣說。</p>
<h3 id="c179">一酒客 <a href="#c179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— 林霓</p>
<p>有這麽一個人，世界上有過他，但又好像不會有過，等記憶着他的人也死去。他沒有政治觀念，他不知道牛頓，不知的愛迪生，但他比我更懂得草的名稱，什麽草治什麼病，更懂得天氣的變化。他知道這塊田出多少穀，那塊田出多少榖。一隻鷄放在他的手上，他能說出它的重量，差不了多少。這麽一個人，我呌他「三叔公。三叔公是十八世，排世輩，二十世的人都得呌他「三叔公。三叔公排行第三，三叔公的哥哥是二叔公，福康叔公——又呌大叔公。我的爸爸却呌三叔公做「壽康叔」，這一下我幾乎忘記了；三叔公自己的名本來是「壽康」，照着福祿壽三字排列起來的。三叔公除了壽康一個名字外，我不曾聽過別樣的稱呼，他大槪沒有別字，不像敎書的鴻儒叔公，別字凌霄，又呌靑山居士，有這許多花樣。</p>
<p>我家屋後是條大路，由縣城一直通到江西邊境，是條交通嬰道，來往的客人頗不少。於是在大路兩旁便築起舖子來，一共有八九間，而且因為是個歇宿的地方，西首第一問便是開客棧，每天晚上都停着許多貨擔子，很有點熱鬧；其餘有三四間酒米店，一間裁縫店，一間雜貨店，一間烟館，一間歇了業的藥材店，壁上「長安堂熟藥」的字還存留着。</p>
<p>西首算起第四間泰安酒米店是我的伯父開的，我繼承給伯父，放學回來多在店裏。在農忙時，家人忙於農事，伯父有時要去縣城或赴集期，我就請一天假，關照店裏的生意。許多酒客中，三叔公也是一個老主顧，除非我家的酒賣完，不然，他是不到別家去的。他總是稱讚伯父做的酒好，斟起來滿杯子的泡——眞正「堆花燒酒」。他也稱讚我，說我年紀這麽小，會寫賬，會招呼人客。三叔公喝酒有定額，他不出聲，四兩燒酒，兩隻五香干；如果問他，他會說：「姪孫，你知道的。」酒，由我斟給他的時候多，有時也由他自己去斟。斟好酒，兩脚蹲在櫃檯外的板櫈上，聳起肩膊，呷一口酒，含在口裏一會，才慢慢的吞下去，然後咬一口五香干，細細的嚼，然後冉呷一口酒。我喜歡三叔公，斟酒時多斟一點。一次，伯父山房裏出來，界我斟得過多，竪起肩毛瞪我一眼，等三叔公出去就說，「不要斟得過多，斟滿了就好了，像你這樣還了得，賣田也不够賠本。」「三叔公的多斟一點，別人就不是這樣。」「三叔公的錢比別人大嗎？越大越蠢了。」但只要伯父不在，三叔公喝酒我還是偷偷地多斟一點。</p>
<p>—未完—</p>
<h3 id="c180">老婆 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— 龍貢公</p>
<p>碰到祝五因為賭錢而輸得頭昏腦脹的時候，他就跟我談起冗長的話來了。那些話，大半是關於他那些老婆的，有一個時候我還誤會過他是一個三妻四妾的脚色，並不是一個窮困而吝嗇的粥店老板。</p>
<p>「唉，賭錢這件事情——怪不得人家說只有聰明的脚色才會受賭錢底累，你看，今天，我可不是又算完了！」</p>
<p>在船尾底廚房門口，在用厚帆布覆蓋着的貨倉口上，或者在甲板上，他碰到我就對我說那樣的話，好像他做了一件對不起我的事情，一定要找個理由來向我解釋似的。</p>
<p>「有賭不為輸，塘乾才見魚。」</p>
<p>「塘乾？……可是我那個管塘的老板娘太蠢了！」他彷彿要哭出來似地說，一面舉起拳頭打自己的太陽穴。「要是她懂得你那句話，她就不會拼命跟我吵架，一個錢也不放鬆了……但是，我們還是談點別的吧。」</p>
<p>他底愁慘的臉孔，萎縮的，歪斜的，時不時要引起別人底憐憫的念頭，但是由於這幾天同船所得的經騐，我知道他大概不會講別的，仍然是他在某一個時期娶一個怎樣的老婆，往後又娶怎麽樣的別一個。他底臉會泛起較為可愛的鮮紅的血色，黃蠟一樣的臉皮被熾熱的火烤熟了，乾燥得要捲曲起來。</p>
<p>秋天所特有的透明的雲影反射着純藍的勇敢而潔净的海面，於是有一種宏大的昏眩的光亮籠罩了我們</p>
<p>「知道什麽人對於你不懷好意，有了難以向你說明的虧心事，要馬上把牠忘記了。這樣你就有福。」</p>
<p>在他身上所有可以貯藏東西的地方都裝滿了世故的敎訓，牠們有些是無知的，不合理的，而且非常可笑。可是對於祝五本人，只有在掏出這些實藏向別人誇耀的時候才是幸福的。</p>
<p>「我娶過三個老婆。你想想看，假使這樣，一個人可以懂得多少事情！第一個呌做阿嬌姐，是一個打工的『阿媽姐』，跟她底主人到北平去了。我曉得她為什麽要跟主人一道去，但我們是不曾講價就『住埋』的，所以我不去問她，也不等她。第二個呌做巧弟，是一個來歷不明的寗波女人，她替我生下一個女兒，但她比我底女兒吵鬧得更利害，我索性把她們一道賣到新加坡去了。第三個也是出錢賣來的，一天到晚賭字花，我底錢給她輸了不少，有一次我狠狠地打了她一頓，她就吊頸死掉了。現在，你看見的，她就是我底老婆，這是第四個；其實，除了給我製造麻煩以外，什麼都沒有，而且不會有的。」</p>
<p>有時他會加上說：</p>
<p>「總之，她們要想花你幾個錢，使你為她們吃點虧，辦法員多得很！」</p>
<p>我不能同意他底意見，痛苦地張開嘴望着他，找不出可以駁倒他的話來。他對我是很淸楚的，知道我並沒有結過婚，而且很窮困。</p>
<p>「你有什麼値得這樣驕傲的呢？凡是你所會做的事，她們都會做的。喝酒，抽烟，還有什麽？」我終於平靜地說了。「從你出世的第一天起，你就受着女人底恩惠。她們無論在怎樣一種災難底下，都是鎭定而且賢德的，多少男人喝了酒？把自己賣出外洋去，殺了人，或者自己殺了自己，可是女人總是忍耐地活着。使自己活不去，而且把你養大了。」</p>
<p>「好，照你說，我們要把一個什麽位子給女人坐呢？——我一點都不懂你的話，你也不懂我的。」</p>
<p>他只是簡單地這樣表示着他底疑惑，就走到甲板上隨便一個賭局旁邊，呆呆地站在那里。有時他要站在那里花掉一兩個鐘頭，才仲着懶腰，沒精打采地鑽下統艙裏面去。</p>
<p>贏了錢的時候，他就跳到船舷旁邊，對那偉大無邊的藍色的海呌着：</p>
<p>「在我底頭上本來有鰥夫兩個字，</p>
<p>現在我有了老婆，她呢，</p>
<p>仲手替我摘了下來了……」</p>
<p>他底唱法很古怪，好像是他自己用天才創造出來的，濁重的鼻音中間，插進許多唔呀唔呀的過門。有時聽聽，又覺得他巳經把流行的舞台歌曲底斷片，一塊一塊地速綴起來了。</p>
<p>有時他要做出不是別人能够摹仿的奇特的舉動來，表明他向快樂裏墜下的深度。他要拋棄一個空的鐵罐子，就做出某種運動的姿勢，口裏念道：</p>
<p>「他年相見，後會有期，去吧！」這樣，他把那件小小的廢物摔下海裏。牠給海浪吸引着，迅速地不由自主地向後倒退，一會兒就落在很遠的後面消失掉了。</p>
<p>祝五開始向我解釋海和船的友誼怎樣惡化了，牠們現在保存着一種什麽關係。</p>
<p>「海是聰明的，强壯的，溫和的。」他說了，一隻手臂在空中劃着圓圈。「但是所有的船都對不起牠。——這就是，牠們天天都把許多煤渣倒在牠身上。牠忍不住了，以後每見一隻船經過，牠就亮出牙齒來。你看這些浪，為什麽海會有浪呢？……船還是把煤渣倒在牠身上，狡猾地穿過牠底牙縫兒，整得牠氣得口裏吐出白沫來……」</p>
<p>他常常用這種美麗的想像娛樂自己，或他所喜歡的別人。</p>

<p>— 德國施托謨著陳隱之譯</p>
<p>『混蛋麽？——他的面孔的確是很混蛋的！』</p>
<p>『娜麗呢？』我問，眼睛瞪着我的朋友。『她自己願意同這個小白臉騎士跳舞麽？』</p>
<p>他把額頭皺起來，我看見一陣昏睡的雲霧現在他的眼中。</p>
<p>『我不知道，』他低聲說。——『你們當初不應該把小姑娘拉到你們「拉丁人」跳舞學校裏去臨時充數。』</p>
<p>他把手伸給我。『再會吧，菲力！他說，『錢，我是要寄還你的；不然的話你就聽不到我的消息了；但是一年以後，如蒙上帝恩惠，我還是要到這裏來，或者回我們故鄉去的。』</p>
<p>他走了。—我要繼續讀我的書，但無論如何讀不下去；對於這兒時伴侶底未來命運的顧慮，縈繞着我的心思。他的話中未曾明說的意思，我都明白了；我知道他的幻想完全給那個姑娘所佔滿了，而這個强壯頭腦正用盡一切力量工作着，使他的生命能同她的生命結合一起。</p>
<p>不久我就到樓下房東住房來，當時我是在房東家裏包飯的。我來得也許早了一點，因為其他房客還沒有一個人來；但在側面小房裏我却碰見那個女裁縫，那個「瞥腳瑪麗』，她默默地孤寂地在一大堆白色衣物間縫紉着。—我旣然常常看見她同我現在所關心的兩個人一起走路，我就把昨天的事件吿訴她，希望從她知道這件事情底確實綠由。</p>
<p>『我知道會有這種事情的！『她說，把兩片薄嘴唇閉得很緊；『那個木工本來樣樣都好，但對小姑娘太順從了。—跟她到跳舞館去幹甚麽？』</p>
<p>我進一步追問她。</p>
<p>她把一部分衣物拿開，騰出一個椅子來，讓我能够坐下。—『你也許認識僧人巷那個小　子吧，』他開始說，當我　從她的眼色坐在椅子上時候；『那個老斯米登，娜麗的姨母，幾年來向隔鄰出租馬匹的人把這小屋買了來；但屋後院子，賣主還是留着沒有賣出去，還同自己的院子合作一塊，因為他營業上需要寬闊的空地；老太波祇能夠在院子中間一小塊草地上漿洗並晾晒衣物，這塊地方也够她用了。她同我故世的母親是表姊妹，我十四歲受過洗禮以後就常常同她出門做針綫生意去。</p>
<p>『我記得在去年馬丁節前不久有一天，我吃過中飯後就到米登家裏去，因為我們我一堆綢衣物要洗。半路上我碰見那個木工，他那時已經問娜麗來往了，我們談了幾句話，分別時候他還笑着對我說：『範日前一晚我要來的，要帮助你們把洗好的衣物晾起來。』我把這話也對娜麗說了，但她好像不甚留心這話。』</p>

<p>偷敦：此間有一美國商號，願以熟練飛機師五十名及醫生一名，供給阿國，另一商號則除願供給大批軍官外，並願供給大批軍火。</p>
<p>美國：黑人台維斯，在歐戰時，曾任下級軍官，近日招募兵士，準備於意阿開戰時，為阿國效勞。</p>
<p>柏林：奧國被逐國外之國社黨員，現正動員，準備協助阿比西尼亞，對意大利作戰。</p>
<p>我常謂今日的世界，已無公理。有之，殆卽為弱肉强食呢？然弱小民族，又豈盡容易壓服的嗎？阿比西尼亞的不屈不撓，實足為弱者吐氣。</p>
<p>阿比西尼亞是一個弱小的民族，她欲和老牌法西斯的强國抵抗，正如螳臂當車，多見其不自諒也，然而亞王半點不肯屈服，前日臨貴族院發表激昂之演說，其中有曰，戰士乎，其效爾勇武先人之所為，不分老少，協禦攻者，如有必要，爾王將為阿比西尼亞與其獨立流血疆塲，不稍遲疑，為自由而死，勝過作奴隸而生萬萬，在最後一分鐘，如不能覓得和平解决之道，則阿比西尼亞將伸手以向眞主乞恩，這樣慷慨激昻的氣槪，不能不令人五體投地，</p>
<p>但是强國到底帮强國，弱國雖有正義和公道，也不能當什麼飯吃，所以近日各國政府，正有拒絕供給阿國軍火之議，阿國不免為之氣餒。然世界公理，畢竟尙未全死滅。觀各國人士之願援助阿國者，已相繼而起。阿比西尼亞亦可以自豪矣。</p>
<h3 id="c184">孩子 <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— 蔚雲</p>
<p>孩子長成得更可愛了：穿上一套新買來的水手裝，戴着我那頂兩倍於他的頭覷的帽子，把眼睛鼻子像一個西瓜似的陷在帽壳裏，舉起手來行軍禮。這是一例。他是知道得許許多多的，雖然足兩歲還有二個月。</p>
<p>今天他從外婆家回來，跑進屋第一句告訴我「婆—板板—買—瓜瓜—」，一邊反伸着兩手，像我寫不出文章的時侯，在狹小的樓中旋圈子。又彷彿一個大演說家，把婆，板板，買，瓜瓜顚來倒去，那個樣子是够逗人發笑的。</p>
<p>他走了一陣子，或許忽然想到婆板板買來的瓜瓜底滋味，撲到我的膝前來，昂起頭，小眼睛睜來有楊梅那樣大，「爹爹，買—瓜瓜—鮮鮮（甜）」！</p>
<p>我沒有回答他，我是想着另一件事，那種面色孩子是看慣了的。「爹爹—賺—板板，」他以為我要寫文章了，就走到檯底下去對娘說：</p>
<p>「瓜瓜—無沒！」把一雙小手掌向天，不知他那里學來了這個舉動。</p>
<p>妻就哄着他「爹爹明天買，」一邊吿訴我孩子看見外婆抬下的西瓜，就這個那個地玩弄着，可是他一個都搬不動。回家時候他還嘗試去搬那個最大的西瓜，「明天眞買一點罷，天這般熱了！」妻最後說。</p>
<p>「媽！」孩子馬上跳了過來，用小手作了個圓形，「鮮鮮—瓜—買！」</p>
<p>他打着手勢旋了個圈子，忽然喊起「帽帽」來，「爹爹—帽帽」</p>
<p>這一來，比不得鮮鮮的西瓜，他呱地放聲哭了。</p>
<p>妻馬上抱了他哄着：爹明天買交　西瓜，鮮鮮的，還有，一個，帽帽。但是孩子不理會，他儘哭，兩只小手比着圓形喊帽帽。</p>
<p>我心裏有點不舒服，孩子專門無理取鬧：西瓜，帽帽。我們的屋子裏許多更重要的東西都沒有置辦，或許晚上的米桶吿訴我要討錢了。但是孩子哭得更起勁，他生下地來也沒有哭得這般利害，旣到這世界上來做一個人，哭是抵不過那委屆的所逼的！</p>
<p>妻似乎己沒有辦法，一手抱了他，一手揮過一個洋囡囡來哄他。</p>
<p>去年孩子週歲，我們抱了他到百貨公司買一套絨線衫褲作為禮物，走到玩具部的時候，他呀呀地砂起來了，他看見櫃台上有一個舉手行敬禮的大洋囡囡，他哭着要買，但是我看過了標價之後終於硬抱他離開了。自然他的哭聲是不能停止的，妻就買了一件小玩具才哄他回家。</p>
<p>從此孩子學會了行禮，而且時常喊着「囡囡」，他的小小的心中是不能記却那個好玩的東西的。今年春天，我鼓了幾次勇氣為他一把號洋囡囡捧回來孩子眞是高興得了不得：他早上醒來，就要囡囡，晚上要抱了牠睡覺。妻特意替牠做了套小衣衫，孩子每時每刻是學着母親的態度把她抱在手裏。但是今天是這洋囡囡的厄運到了，妻抱到手裏的時候，孩子使勁地把牠摔了，這樣他還是不滿意，從母親手中擠下來，把洋囡囡蹂成一個塌餅。</p>
<p>我的恕氣升起來了，這般小小年紀有這末大的脾氣，難道一點不知道買這個洋囡囡和做一套新衣服一樣地不容易！我從椅子上跳起來，想打他一頓；但是孩子是聰明的，他馬上撲到我的膝前，划着小手叫爹爹，要我抱。妻恐怕我眞的要打他，哄他上床睡了——他還低聲地對妻說要買帽帽。</p>
<p>這是一個月以前的事了，我抱他從公園中回來，走到一家很大的洋雜貸店，玻璃櫃吊着各種各式的孩帽，孩子當時就吵着要買，我告訴他爹爹沒有錢，過幾天買一頂好的，他點頭答應了，但是沒有那洋囡囡一樣順手，過了這許多日子我還是不能滿足他預支的希望。孩子遷怒到洋囡囡身上——或許他懂得一點做人的道理了。</p>
<p>但是在另外的事沒有着落的時候，我雖有替他買帽子的誠意，恐怕是永遠沒有希望的了。我但願他今天晚上不要做着一個做帽子的夢！</p>

<h3 id="c185">船上 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— 西蒙</p>
<p>盛夏的六月天，雖在午夜時候下船，還是燠熱得很，纔把行李弄停當，粗大的汗珠已沁滿一額，直至背窩心的襯衣也濕透了。而船艙裏一種特有的煤油的臭氣，鐵銹的霉味，以及混和着旁的說不出的齷齪的濁味，一陣陣在鼻觀上蒸發着，刺鬧着。使你幾乎難堪到要作嘔。於是只得暫時蹩出這窒礙的氣氛，順着扶梯步上甲板上吹吹風，站到鐵欄柵的前邊，凝視遠處夜的海景。</p>
<p>從緊接扶梯口一條窄小的走道伸展到船腹腰的中間，全是作為統艙的地方，每個船客早各自佔着舗蓆的塲地，東攤一塊蓆，西攤一塊蓆，凌亂地，人擁擠着儘竪的橫的躺着，也有的坐着合了幾個人在撩閒天。專在船上兜攬生意的小販，掠人堆縫裏兒穿穿進進的叫賣着，再加上起動機的旋轉。以及各種人聲的吵鬧，便顯出異樣的嘈雜來了。</p>
<p>這嘈雜的交響奏一直繼續到夜深的時候方始漸漸平靜，現在就賸下不大的海浪在一起一落的撞襲着船舷，震蕩出輕碎嘩啦嘩啦的聲響。</p>
<p>靜寂里，背後忽然有支嘆息着的嗓腔在向誰說着了：</p>
<p>唉，已經成了這樣殘缺無用的人，還有什麽顏面回歸見着親人。祖宗又沒留下三分田，兩幢屋子，而老婆見子老娘一起子倒有好幾個，靠吃誰！如何挨過日子呢？眞是不如在那一回給打死乾凈。</p>
<p>—橫竪作活作死自己也顧不了，總是回去再說就是了，有飯大家吃，沒飯大家餓肚子。</p>
<p>作着答腔的人好像樂觀些的慰藉對方，但說後，一同地呼了口深深的氣。</p>
<p>—他媽的娘，咱們也是一個人，為什要把生命白犧牲掉，讓那班狗兔們踐踏，給他們做踹墊！</p>
<p>對方越說越激奮，聲息裏越盈溢着極度的嫉憤。</p>
<p>—別說這些了，怎說怎也不中用的。祇怨自家骨頭輕，合該一輩子吃虧的</p>
<p>這兩個人的交談漸次嘹曉起來，接着另有幾個人好像在薄睡中被攪醒打着呵欠，艱辛地翻着身，隨後有個問着：</p>
<p>—你們做什麼談得那麼起勁，還不想睏！時候不早了吧。</p>
<p>—你　你的，誰也沒你的幸福，一躺下去便　了。躺下去便睏了。</p>
<p>那兩個中有一個帶着冷笑刺答着。</p>
<p>嘆息聲又從各人的喉嚨裏噓出來，憂鬱地繚繞在凝寂的夜室中。</p>
<h3 id="c186">口角 <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— 凌秄錫</p>
<p>天氣一天一天地熱起來了：先是秧汎裏的半個多月的旱，太陽像火一樣地照着，從淸早到黃昏，彷彿下了决心定要把這一片田地烤成了灰末似的；人們為了那些嬌嫩的命根子似的秧苗，日裏死命地在水車上用力，到晚來則對了一頓粗劣的餐食在發呆，心裏是煩燥得什麼似的——也彷彿有一片旺太陽在烤灸着。而半個來月前，好容易下了幾塲大雨，人們正喜歡着，像心上淸脫了一堆石子，却不料這雨水又下得沒有休止了；稻田可比不得是秧田，已經不適宜於多量的水份了，而且氣候漸漸地凉下來，田裏的瓜果也値不了大價錢了，最壞的就是水還是不停地灌下來，低地上已經發起水來了；這樣，人們把已經提起來的希望與高興的心重又冷了下去，這冰冷的水彷彿已經流進心上來了，一想起這，是會敎人恐慌得打顫的。</p>
<p>為了這，人們是已經不再有一種安靜的威覺，而却祗是在發愁與憂急中打圈子了。帶了一種煩燥的心情，綳起了臉，大家全祗想使性子。於是，打雞駡狗的，連好聲氣也沒有了。</p>
<p>田塲上，人們為了一兩升糧食之宿欠的爭執是常有的：通紅了臉，大聲地說着田野問的話語，口水像止不住的雨點那樣地直噴，爭執了，怒駡了，毆打了。這中間，一種怨恨，恐慌與意氣複雜地混合着，像一個紛亂的結。</p>
<p>家庭中，人們也從憂急中學得了粗暴的性子，為了生活得不很順利，妻子怨男人，男人打妻子的事情是算不得奇怪的。為了男人出門去借不到米，或者是把賣去一疋僅有的土布得來的錢化去了一部份：買了燒酒吃得醉熏黨地回來了；對這，妻子當然是不肯罷休的，扭着男人，便死命地鬧起來了；日子是艱難的，難道還想把一家子人都換了黃湯喝下去嗎？「你這銃不死的酒鬼，嫁了你一輩子，也沒過一天好日子，還忍心把一家子苦做來的錢灌黃湯！活够了，我也不要活了，你這天殺的，跟你拼……」</p>
<p>哭着，鬧着，而男的，酒在肚子裏，煩燥在心頭上，一切的生活的不快意敎給了他一種可怕的橫蠻，紅了眼睛，不說一句話，拖過女人來，揪住頭髮，便把拳頭死命地望女人的身上打去：「我，我……活够了，你們給我去死！」</p>
<p>「打，你打吧，打死了也好，我跟你，跟你拼了這命……」</p>
<p>哭着，鬧着，怒駡着，毆打着；上個夜晚沈沈地過去了。第二天醒來依然懷了一種說不出的怨恨與氣意，這些，細想起來，是一點都沒有理由的；然而却始終像一根刺一樣地梗在人底心頭，多叫人難受啊！</p>
<p>在田問，在村裏，日常的一塲塲的口角跟着日子的艱難，像夏雨一般地飄着：過去了，又發生了。這，像生活的喜劇那樣地，在斷續地串演着；然而人們却全覺得：這一定不是喜劇。大家全記得：本來的性情可好像完全不是這樣的，而現在，生活在人底性情中似乎撒上了一點辣味的胡椒，把人攪得不自知的煩燥與難受起來了。</p>
<p>也許，這些無端的，不快意的口角是跟着命運與年頭走的；也許這是一陣狂風，不久就夫平靜的罷？</p>

<h3 id="c187">無聊與寂寞 <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— 魯蓀</p>
<p>像被毒蛇咬着自家的心那樣痛苦，像被軟索子困着自家的四肢那樣不自由，總之，一種說不出什麼的纏繞着我的四週；有時簡直在這個世界中已沒有了自家身體安放的所在。那種苦痛日夜不放鬆地煎逼着，於是在下雨天，竟像一個上寫字間的職員那樣匁忙地披上雨衣出門了；又彷彿家中生了鬼怪，要逃避那種磨難似的。然而當那冰冷的雨絲打擊着自己的時候，又覺得太無謂了，一點都沒有事趕出門來作甚呢？反悔却是不會的總是順着自己的脚走去，其實我的兩條腿也不會有什麽主意的。走過一條馬路又一條，那樣緩慢：看着電車在鐵軌上駛來駛去，看着人力車夫曲了背去抵抗迎面打來的風，或許我希望着一個漂亮的女子從車篷上翻一個觔斗，才使我爽快地笑一陣。人彷彿是個瘋子，一點主意沒有：却又多得來不得安排牠們。譬如：走過一個朋友的家了，進去撩一陣天吧，心裏想着。自然按門鈴，由朋友招待進去，不論知己的，生疏的，剛坐定，第二個主意又謎責我多事了，馬上找一個他不能置答的問題離開他。但是踏出了門口，又賣問着自己坐一會不是很好嗎？</p>
<p>雖然自己一切的舉動都有些反常，但是事後往往反悔，而且立决以後决不這樣幹；然而被那種莫可名狀的痛苦狙撃着的時侯，就不允許你有什麽顧慮了。這種舉動落在朋友們底眼裏，他們都說我「無聊」。我自己却不承認，有時又爲了這問題，引起我的長篇大論，卽使是極知己的朋友鬧翻的事時常有的</p>
<p>最近一個少時候的同學結婚，許多老朋友在喜筵上聚會了。或許他們是善意的，聯合着向我攻擊：說我變態，說我恐怕又跦進了戀愛的網中，用種種方法擊動我。我心中是十分懊怒的，在平常時候，我一定不吿而別了。用那種惡毒的言語來取笑一個被苦痛煎熬着的朋友，在無論那方面是說不過去的。但是那天的朋友的佳期，在主人份上，我不龍使他們那樣掃興；於是也抓住了每個人的話柄，想方法來報復。後來幾乎各個朋友的不可吿人之隱都被我揭破了，我覺得從事沒有那樣的快意，在他們公舉我做鬧洞房的首領的時候，又恢復了那一股勁滿灌了幾杯黃濟。</p>
<p>那一天我完全變了一個人，鬧得那樣起勁，什麽嬉皮笑臉的本飯都施農了出來。在各人的臉上我知道他們也是很快樂的，他們以爲我已從那痛苦的深淵中解救出來。他們提議組織一個進學會什麽之類，使那末多的朋友時常有會面的機會。他們是想改造我，而且我也願意被他們改造的：我的心被救了，我的四肢恢復了自由，在那天幾小時之內。</p>
<p>但是當辭別主人歸家，一踏同狹小的住所，那些無形的較索子又縛住了我的四肢。剛才獲得的細微快樂，換來了更痛苦的回憶。那是個月明之夜，把這個世界像塑上一片銀色的光一樣，在這銀光下的人類，我看得很淸楚，爲了利益纔能聯合，否則都是孤零零的。朋友—卽是我的父母妻子也是被那種關係才聯結起來的。那末，那種莫可名狀的痛苦，或許是孤獨底寂寞吧？我是那樣孤獨地生存在這世界中呵！</p>

<p>（上略）這一天，我們到了荒蠻的石島，島上的漁民，爲了好奇怪的原故，却寸步不離的國觀着我們這一羣；我們的住所成了問題，結果經過了一番爭辯，我們祇得暫時不榻在一個破舊的古屋裏。夜裏，大家沒有想到需要睡覺，便借着這古屋的題材而談起鬼怪來了。這樣一來可不得了，害得莉影，方琲兩位小姐晚上夢到鬼，而且疑心這古屋中眞有鬼似的。</p>
<p>在這一個恐怖的窟裏，除了屋低地濕之外，還充滿了魚腥氣，導演王斌，也不顧一切的開始講起明天開拍的準備了。符保盧與方琲讀對白，陳天國，田方看劇情，王斌，周和康，沈勇石，周玉林研究拍海景的方法，與鏡頭的角度間題，馬東武，魏鵬飛等籌備劇務方面的一切問題，看起來一羣一羣的好像闕聯的小組會議了。</p>
<p>海在狂嘯着，深夜了，他們的談話聲也漸漸地的小了，一個一個漸漸地的打着鼻鼾，疲乏得呌他們忘了一切。</p>

<h3 id="e14">Italian-Abyssinian War is Imminent <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>The Italian-Abyssinian dispute, which has attracted worldwide attention, has now entered an irreconcilable stage. According to recent news, the Italian army gathered in Eritrea has reached 10 divisions, with a total of approximately 185,000 troops, planning to commence military operations after the rainy season. The outbreak of the Italian-Abyssinian War is but a matter of a month or so. This time, Italy is determined to use force against Abyssinia, ostensibly due to border disputes, but its motives are multifaceted. Italy played a significant role in Europe during World War I, and subsequently at various international conferences. However, Italy received nothing from the division of German colonies after the war, and it is difficult to avoid resentment. Now, the European situation is favorable to Italy, and it is an opportune time to seek the expansion of its East African colonies. This is one reason. The essence of fascist rule is to promote national prestige. Mussolini has been in power for more than a decade. In order to consolidate his personal prestige at home and for the honor of the country and the nation, it is necessary to flex military muscle. This is another reason. Forty years ago, Abyssinia defeated the Italian expeditionary force at Adwa. This historical humiliation also relies on Mussolini to avenge. This is yet another reason. Mussolini once said that the spirit of combat must be expressed through the act of war, and the techniques of combat must be refined through the experience of war. It can be seen that this time, the use of force against Abyssinia is actually intended to awaken the national spirit of courage and war, and to make Abyssinia an actual training ground for Italy. This is yet another reason. In recent years, Italy has implemented fascist policies, but the number of unemployed continues to increase annually. Using force in East Africa can solve the problem of unemployment at home. This is the fifth reason.</p>
<p>Italy has various intentions as stated above, and has clearly stated that it is determined to reduce Abyssinia to a protectorate. The King of Abyssinia has recently declared to his people that exchanging territories is still possible, but ceding territory or reducing Abyssinia to a protectorate is unacceptable under any circumstances. If Italy uses force, it can only do its best to deal with the Italians. The attitudes of both sides are so firm that there is no peace to speak of. Although the League of Nations Council will meet on the 25th of this month for final mediation, its success is unlikely. Among the League of Nations, France's attitude is in a very important position. France has repeatedly expressed its unwillingness to help England antagonize Italy. Losing Italy and causing it to withdraw from the League of Nations to join hands with Germany would be a major blow to French diplomacy. France would not be so irrational. Mussolini sees through this crux, so he dares to act boldly on the Abyssinian issue. England cannot help, so it is difficult to clap with one hand. On the 11th of this month, British Foreign Secretary Hoare said in a speech to Parliament that the plan to sanction Italy was unfounded. It can be seen that although Italy's actions pose a serious threat to British interests in East Africa, Britain does not dare to openly stop them. Looking at the situation from all sides, the fate of the Abyssinian issue in the League of Nations is almost the same as the Northeast Incident.</p>

<p>(London) The government today released a document of 16,000 words, detailing the reasons why the government refused to adopt the "New Deal" proposed by former Prime Minister Lloyd George. The government gave a considered response to each point in George's memorandum, pointing out that George's proposals were broad and mediocre, and stated that several points would hinder the national revival and progress that was already underway. It also stated that the general purpose of George's plan was the same as the government's, but the question was whether the methods he proposed were appropriate. Finance should not be an obstacle to any sound plan, but George's proposed prosperity loan of £250 million would greatly disrupt finances and have a tightening effect. George's estimates for reducing unemployment were purely speculative and had no real value. George's proposals for public works lacked details and budgets. To say that there are large-scale jobs that have not been discovered before that can accommodate a large number of unemployed people is just fantasy. George's agricultural proposals are the key to his plan, but this is a dangerous and uncertain attempt, which, even if feasible, would require paying the price of a non-natural increase in food prices, damaging British Empire trade and its relations, making export trade more difficult, and causing more unemployment among the industrial population. George's proposals for reorganizing industry are too vague and, if implemented, would not reduce unemployment. George's suggestions for developing overseas trade are disappointing and unhelpful. George's public works procedures did not have any new and good suggestions, and his proposals for a National Development Bureau and a special small cabinet were also unacceptable. George's suggestions regarding Soviet Russia seem to ignore the fundamental development of Soviet Russia. If George's proposals regarding China were implemented, China's exports to the UK would be reduced by more than one-third. As for the issue of assisting China, the British government often consults with other relevant countries and pays attention to it. Therefore, Britain sent Sir Ross to China to investigate its economic situation. British trade with China can be expected to expand, but George's belief that there is no limit to this expansion can be said to be ignoring all the facts today. The government's document concludes that the work that the government has already done and plans to do can at least prove to be better than George's proposals. (Reuters dispatch from the 21st)</p>

<p>(Rome) The Italian government is very displeased with the King of Abyssinia's passionate address to parliament on Thursday, and has lodged a serious protest with the government through its minister to Abyssinia. (Reuters dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>(Rome) Rumors about the severance of diplomatic relations between Italy and Abyssinia were denied by responsible authorities here last night. The official gazette stated that the Italian minister to Abyssinia only protested to the Abyssinian government about the Abyssinian King's remarks in parliament. Further decisions are reserved by Italy. It was also stated that the meaning of the Abyssinian King's remarks and his arrogant attitude have created a serious situation. The newspaper further stated that the original text of the Abyssinian King's speech was even more激烈than the French translation given to foreign reporters. It concluded that since the Abyssinian King had made such remarks, all hopes for a peaceful resolution would inevitably be dashed. (National Telegram from the 21st)</p>
<p>(Rome) Regarding the Abyssinian King's speech in parliament on the 18th, the Italian government has instructed its minister to Abyssinia to lodge a strong protest with the Abyssinian foreign ministry, stating that the Abyssinian King's speech has had serious consequences for Italian-Abyssinian relations. It is reported that Prime Minister Mussolini compared the original text of the speech with the newspaper's account and found that the original text was even more provocative. The Italian foreign ministry did not announce any demands from Italy, but the protest denied that Italy had been plotting against Abyssinia for forty years, as Italy's deployment of heavy troops in East Africa occurred after the Abyssinian army attacked Italian territory in Walwal in recent times. Observers believe that the current situation is extremely dangerous, as the wording of this protest is stronger than before. (National Telegram from the 21st)</p>
<p>(Cairo) The various countries with diplomatic representatives stationed in the Abyssinian capital are now taking urgent steps to protect their representatives in Abyssinia in the event of war between Italy and Abyssinia. Britain has transported one million sandbags from Egypt to Abyssinia to protect the British Embassy in the Abyssinian capital and the British Minister, British Consul General and staff. The general feeling among people in Egypt and Sudan is that war is ultimately inevitable, but it is not known when it will break out. It is believed that if the League of Nations Council holds a meeting on July 29 to discuss the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, the outbreak of war between the two countries will be earlier than expected. However, the weather is currently hot, and Italy, feeling that the offensive is difficult, may not launch an attack in a hurry. (Reuters dispatch from the 21st)</p>

<p>(Paris) Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, speaking to Mr. Grilleis, a reporter for the Paris Echo yesterday regarding the Abyssinian issue, said, "A black, savage, and bellicose nation in the world wants to confront a great nation that is transforming mankind in a court. Is the League of Nations likening itself to this court? Does the parliamentary system depend on the majority? Is the League of Nations relying on the majority and allowing Europe to fail and decline? It is time to adjudicate these issues." When Grilleis questioned Mussolini about the geographical and climatic difficulties that could be encountered in attacking Abyssinia, Mussolini replied, "I am very familiar with these matters. I have thought deeply, prepared meticulously, and am by no means comparable to acting rashly. I can tell you one thing, and that is that Italy will be able to achieve its goals. My concern for Italy is the same as that of the British giants who created the British Empire and the great colonialists who built the French Empire, each of whom was concerned for their own country." Grilleis then asked whether attention should be paid to the fact that side issues might arise in Europe when Italy attacks Abyssinia. Mussolini replied, "Europe will be relatively peaceful in the next two or three years. I have decided to hold large-scale maneuvers in northern Italy in early August, with 500,000 army personnel participating. By October, Italy will have as many as one million active-duty soldiers. I fear nothing and no one. The Italian nation has almost fully understood everything I want to do and why I want to do it," etc. (Havas dispatch from the 20th)</p>

<p>(Rome) The Rome People's Daily believes that the Italian-Abyssinian war has become inevitable and that there is no possibility of a compromise. The newspaper stated that Abyssinia refuses to make concessions to Italy for the following reasons: (1) In the Battle of Adwa in 1896, several hundred Italian troops were defeated by Abyssinian troops, so Abyssinia has a contempt for Italy. (2) Abyssinia believes that the League of Nations is its true protector and that the League of Nations Covenant can be used as a bulwark to protect Abyssinia. This is due to the fact that European newspapers do not understand the true nature of the League of Nations Covenant. In Italy's view, the League of Nations Covenant is the same as other treaties and can be amended at any time. (3) The Abyssinian Emperor is acting recklessly and has to respect the opinions of his vassals and be hostile to Italy. (4) The main reason is the United Kingdom. If Abyssinia continues to believe that the United Kingdom is sufficient to be its backing, then Abyssinia will never be willing to make concessions. (Havas dispatch from the 21st)</p>

Now Italy has come out to intervene, and its intention is no more than that, and there are sufficient reasons to support it. Pirandello also cited the past events in the Americas as an example, saying that the Native Americans were once a savage nation, but later they were civilized by the British. US President Lincoln's liberation of slaves was a great achievement. His intention was as if to say that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's actions towards Abyssinia were also imitating what Lincoln had done. (Havas dispatch from the 21st)</p>

<p>(London) Italy's demand for complete control of Abyssinia, which Britain cannot agree to, has caused diplomatic talks in London, Paris, and Rome to stall completely today. However, the hope of a peaceful resolution has not been abandoned, and diplomats still want France to find a way to avoid war. At present, it is generally impossible for the foreign ministers of Britain, France, and Italy to hold a meeting. It is reported that Britain is eager to prepare for a meeting between the British and French ambassadors to Italy and Mussolini in Rome. However, there is currently no basis for this meeting, because Italy still wants to continue negotiations based on the 1906 British-French-Italian treaty, while Britain insists that the Italian-Abyssinian dispute must be handled according to the Kellogg-Briand Pact.

<p>(Berlin) The new Berlin Police Commissioner, Helldorf, took office yesterday. He recently gave a speech to the National Socialist Party's official newspaper, the Völkischer Beobachter, stating, "The duties of the Berlin Police Commissioner, in addition to fighting against the Jewish intellectual circles, also require dealing with reactionary elements from all sides, including the Communist Party and 'political Catholicism.' The main goal is to work closely with the Berlin district leaders of the National Socialist Party and the municipal authorities of the capital city without the slightest bit of laxity. Berlin, as the exemplary capital, was conquered by the National Socialist Party. The head of state handles political affairs here, and the cabinet is also stationed here. To ensure effective work, it is essential to cooperate closely with the National Socialist Party authorities, especially the Berlin district leaders." Helldorf also said, "Certain Jews openly act arrogantly, as if intending to provoke. They should know that as residents of Germany, enjoying its resources, they have an obligation to their host and cannot make excuses." (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>

This shows that the party army will actively participate in the eradication work against all reactionary elements in the capital who seek to harm National Socialism. This will be even more intense than in the past." It is reported that Helldorf's transfer to Berlin Police Commissioner was decided by the National Socialist Party cadre meeting. The party army expressed enthusiastic welcome for this appointment and clearly desires to achieve results in this work. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Reasons for Rejecting Catholicism</p>
<p>(Berlin) The trend of rejecting Catholicism is growing stronger daily. The reason seems to be that in certain provinces and regions, especially those where Catholicism is prevalent in the west, the authority of the National Socialist Party is declining. This can be evidenced by several things. It is recalled that after the death of the former President Hindenburg last year, the German authorities held a referendum on August 19 to grant supreme authority to Führer Hitler. At that time, in places such as Cologne, Trier, and Aachen in the west, a large number of people voted against it. When Bishop Galen of Münster recently clashed with the National Socialist Party, this situation became even more evident. In Koblenz, local National Socialist Party members held a conference a few days ago, but the residents openly showed a cold attitude and did not participate in the demonstration. Moreover, when the National Socialist Party members marched, they returned to their homes and closed their windows. In areas such as the highlands near the Rhine River and in the villages of Siegwart, Catholicism is very strong. The local National Socialist Party youth group is often attacked by the Catholic youth group, the "Youth Power Group." All these are numerous examples. The former director of the political police, now the administrative chief of Cologne, Dieser, recently submitted a report to Prussian Governor Göring regarding the activities of Catholics and the "hate crimes" committed by Catholic priests. It is possible that Dieser will take charge of the crackdown on "political Catholicism" in the future, as he was previously in charge of everything during the suppression of communism.

<p>Orders Issued to Suppress Political Activities</p>
<p>(Berlin) After the government's harsh measures against Catholicism were notified to local authorities by Göring, the Minister of Justice today informed the prosecutors in various regions. At the same time, the Minister of Justice attached an order requesting the prosecutors to cooperate with the police authorities and the government to suppress the political activities of Catholicism. Therefore, whenever Catholics engage in political activities, the prosecutors should immediately report them and not easily let them go. (Kokumin dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Prosecutors throughout Germany have received orders from Justice Minister Gürtner today to actively prosecute the political activities of Catholicism. The Justice Minister stated that such activities have the power to divide the nation and break its unity. Furthermore, Berlin Police Chief Helldorf today ordered all ice cream parlors opened by Jews to close at 7:00 PM every evening to maintain peace and avoid unnecessary demonstrations. (Kokumin Social dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>Munich: The police department closed the reason for the opposition to the government by the Catholic Church, resulting in tension between the Catholic Church and the National Socialist Party's youth groups. (Kokumin Social dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>Viewing Bishop Galen as an Enemy</p>
<p>Münster, Germany: Since Bishop Galen of the Catholic Church in Münster clashed with the National Socialist Party authorities, many people have expressed their approval. He recently published a letter of thanks in a Catholic weekly, saying, "People of various occupations, such as clergy, laity, nobles, citizens, farmers, and workers, have expressed their love and loyalty to me." The Essen National Daily, controlled by Prussian Prime Minister Göring, reported that Bishop Galen's action was another provocative act, and also said, "Under the current circumstances, all those who are threatened or thanked by Bishop Galen must undoubtedly be enemies of the state. We should treat them as enemies of the state, and they should not find it strange." (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Publicizing Jewish Crimes Abroad</p>
<p>(Berlin) General Daluege, Chief of the German Police, today presented the press with detailed statistics on Jewish crime to prove the legitimacy of the anti-Jewish movement in Germany, claiming that judging from the statistics, the incidence of crime is highest among Jewish residents. Foreign public opinion often cannot understand the anti-Jewish movement in Germany. If foreigners could understand these Jewish crime statistics, they would not only not favor the Jews, but would also pay attention to the crimes of Jews in their own countries. Daluege continued that the most frequent crimes among Jews are commercial fraud, theft and pickpocketing, fraudulent gambling, and drug trafficking, especially drug trafficking is most prevalent among Jews. From 1931 to 1934, Jews accounted for 26 percent of those arrested for international drug trafficking, while Germans accounted for only 3.25 percent. Thus, it can be seen that the anti-Jewish movement in Germany has strong reasons. (Kokumin dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Jewish Businessman Illegally Detained</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Hanover secret police today detained a Jewish businessman named Kahn on the charge of "racial insult" because Kahn allegedly had intimate relations with thirteen Aryan women. According to Germany's new laws, Jews are not allowed to have sexual relations with Germans. (Kokumin dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Attacks continue against Jews who "insult the Aryan race by engaging in sexual relations with young German women." The Advance News reported that a Jewish livestock merchant in a village near Mannheim was arrested for "raping a fourteen-year-old maid." The Niederlön district newspaper of Hanover reported that a Jewish merchant was charged with "continuously insulting the Aryan race" and has been sent to the Esterwegen concentration camp because the merchant took advantage of German women in distress and raped as many as thirteen of them. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Hungarian Newspaper Comments on German Political Situation</p>
<p>Budapest, Hungary: The semi-official Hungarian newspaper Pester Lloyd commented on the domestic situation in Germany, saying, "The country's political discussions are chaotic and insufficient to appease the people's hearts." The new Berlin Police Commissioner Helldorf plans to have a "large-scale purge." One can imagine by what means this plan will be implemented. But the Third Reich authorities often say that the residents of the capital are mostly poisoned by anti-National Socialist ideas. It is difficult to find the reason. The German authorities have already dissolved the Stahlhelm and declared war on the Protestant Church, and are also repelling the Catholic Church. The tense situation in the country is self-evident.

<p>(San Francisco) Democratic Congressman McGrath, a member of the House Naval Affairs Committee, announced today that he will propose to Congress the addition of six dry docks in San Francisco Bay, each capable of accommodating a battleship. Other members of the committee also said that they plan to propose the construction of a naval air base south of San Francisco and the conversion of the Sunnyvale airfield into the headquarters for large airships.

<p>(Washington) The War Department today requested Congress to allocate US$40 million to purchase more than 600 military aircraft, including 175 pursuit planes, 250 bombers, and 200 fighter planes. (Kokumin dispatch, 21st) (Tokyo) It is expected that the United States Navy will be in an era of no treaties, and will try its best to realize its plan to become the world's number one naval power. At present, it will try its best to expand its shipbuilding capacity and the ability of its bases to accommodate fleets, and carry out its auxiliary repairs and the completion of various facilities. As for the consolidation and expansion of the above-mentioned various facilities, there are amazing aspects. The US Navy's land and water equipment costs, after the Washington Conference, invested 155 million yuan. From 1925 to 1930, the six years, only 20 million yuan of the budget was used for implementation, but in the 1936 fiscal year, it increased to 46 million yuan in one year. It can be seen how the United States is preparing for the competition to increase ships. Now, let's record the main points of its land and water equipment for implementation:</p>
<p>(1) Expand the equipment of the dock, increase shipbuilding capacity and repair capacity, and there is also a plan to build a giant floating dock to accommodate battleships. (2) Newly built mooring embankments and docks, expand the ship parking area, so that large naval forces can enter the port. (3) The fuel stored at the base must increase its storage capacity.</p>
<p>Among the above-mentioned situations, the most noteworthy is that most of the various equipments are set up at bases in the Pacific, such as San Francisco, San Diego, San Pedro, Vallejo Setshawende, the Panama Canal, and the Pearl Harbor water and land equipment are especially important. It is now possible to accommodate the entire fleet and store a large amount of fuel. It is also heard that the equipment will be expanded in the future. (Nichi-Ren dispatch, 21st)</p>

<p>Ottawa: After the Japanese government decided to impose an import surtax of 50% on Canadian goods due to the implementation of the Trade Defense Act, Canadian Prime Minister Bennett recently issued a statement that the United Kingdom and Japan signed a commercial treaty in 1913, and Canada later joined it. The Japanese government's move is in conflict with the current treaty. Canada plans to levy an ad valorem surtax of 33% on Japanese goods as retaliation. So far, neither side has implemented it. The Canadian government is currently negotiating with Japan in the hope of finding a compromise. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Canadian Minister to Japan, Mr. Mara, visited the Director of the Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Kurai, on the afternoon of the 20th and accepted the Japanese government's official report on the implementation of the Trade Defense Act on Canada. Minister Mara briefly stated that the Canadian government is considering countermeasures for this case, but since the matter has come to this, the Canadian government should also stipulate, based on retaliatory tariffs, that all Japanese goods must be taxed with an ad valorem surtax of 33 and one-third percent. It has been informally stated that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs plans to conduct diplomatic negotiations with Canada on trade adjustment after the Canadian general election on September 3 is over and the political situation is slightly stabilized. At present, it will be left in a state of rupture. (Nichi-Ren dispatch, 21st)</p>

<p>(Paris) French archaeologist Barro discovered the relics of a school from 3,000 years BC while excavating underground terraces near Abu Kamal, Syria. The area was a place rich in culture and history 2,000 years ago, and its cities were built by the Hittites. Ancient Egyptian historical records state that the Hittites were brilliant in scholarship, surpassing Babylon and Egypt. This excavation further confirms this. Barro discovered the relics of a heavenly palace at that time. The Hittite palace was several kilometers around, and the defense works were very strong. It was later captured and burned to the ground by the Babylonian king. However, even today, the ruins can still be found by excavating underground. In addition, the ruins of an ancient school were also discovered, with classrooms and podiums where the youth of the city were educated at that time. As for the architecture of the palace, its richness, beauty, and comfort were unmatched by the Middle Ages. The streets in the city were vertical and horizontal, intersecting at right angles. The houses had wide staircases, and there were cellars for storing food. The drainage system was also very complete. River water was poured into the city through ditches to provide for the residents. Most of the houses also had washrooms with ceramic bathtubs. (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>

<p>The Sino-French Agreement on Relations Between Vietnam and the Border Provinces of China, previously signed on May 16, 1930, by the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Wang Zhengting, and the former French Minister to China, Comte de Martel, could not be implemented because Schedules A and B of the first annex were not agreed upon, and the procedures were incomplete. After five years of repeated consultations, Schedules A and B were finally completely agreed upon recently, and other relevant annexes were also agreed upon at the same time. At 4:00 PM on May 4th of this year, Acting Foreign Minister Wang and French Minister to China, Wilden, at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, formally signed the "Protocol on the Establishment of Schedules A and B," and exchanged notes on other annexes simultaneously.

According to Finance Director Xu Qingfu's statement to reporters on the 21st, Mr. Huang is still detained in Shanghai due to business matters, and there is no definite news about when he will return to Hangzhou. It is said that Mr. Huang took a plane from Wuhan on the morning of the 19th and briefly stopped in Beijing, and then flew to Shanghai on the same plane. Huang Huabiao, Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, went to Shanghai by car on the evening of the 19th, having been summoned. Zhejiang previously requested approval for the allocation of two million in customs bonds to subsidize Zhejiang's finances. It is now known that this case has been approved and transferred to the Ministry of Finance for review. The Provincial Government has ordered all counties and cities that all dike and embankment repairs following the floods shall be centrally managed by the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, and all counties and cities should be subject to its guidance.

<h3 id="e78">Water Conservancy Personnel in Jinan Discuss Water Management Measures, Upper Yellow River in Shanzhou Reports Another Rise in Water Level <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Yellow River in Shandong Province, since the breach at Dongzhuang and Linpuji in the upper reaches, has been overflowing for ten days. The Yellow River is flowing horizontally, and its momentum is extremely fierce. Dozens of counties, including Zoucheng, Juye, Jiaxiang, and Jining, have been flooded. Recently, due to heavy rainfall, all rivers have risen, and the floodwaters have entered Nanyang Lake, with signs of further southward movement. Dingtao and Chengwu have already seen water, and Jinxiang and Yutai will also inevitably be affected. With the situation in southern Shandong being so dire, northern Jiangsu is even more at risk. Therefore, Li Yi, Chairman of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission, Zhang Hanying, Secretary-General, Puteli, a water conservancy expert from the League of Nations and advisor to the National Economic Commission, and Wan Lifu, an engineer from the Central Hydraulic Engineering Experiment Institute, have all come to Jinan together. They were originally scheduled to inspect the breach on the 20th and inspect the Jindi embankment, but this was canceled due to rain. It was rescheduled to depart on the 21st to the breaches between Juancheng, Dong, and Lin. The breaches at numbers one, two, three, and four have gradually silted up, and the amount of water passing through them is very small. The water outflow from numbers five and six accounts for nearly 70-80% of the main river. Therefore, the most urgent task is to close the breaches and divert the floodwaters. Li, Zhang, Puteli, and others, along with Kong Lingrong, Director of the Shandong Canal Engineering Bureau, Song Wentian, a technician from the Construction Department, and Pan Jianfen, Chief of the Engineering Section of the River Affairs Bureau, held discussions. They all believed that since the river water is currently at its peak and the breach closure project cannot be started yet, the disaster area will inevitably expand daily if a solution to the flood discharge problem is not sought quickly. Therefore, it is proposed to divert the Yellow River into two streams. One stream will move north into Dongping Lake and return to the main river through the canal, and the other stream will move south into Weishan Lake and into the Liutang River. However, due to the need for the water entering Dongping Lake to pass through the dikes at the border of Dongping and Shouzhang, there are still many difficulties. There are also difficulties with the stream entering Liutang, so a decision could not be made. After the meeting adjourned at 10:00 a.m., they went to the Construction Department and the River Affairs Bureau to investigate the terrain of the disaster area and nearby rivers and lakes in detail. They scheduled another meeting at 8:00 p.m. to discuss further.</p>
<p>The water level and flow rate of the Yellow River this year are different from previous years. Therefore, as soon as a dangerous situation was reported, immediate blocking was attempted. As a result, the dikes collapsed and flooded unimpeded. On the 19th, Zhang Lianjia, Director of the Shandong River Affairs Bureau, reported to Han Fuqu, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, that Shanzhou in the upper reaches had reported another rise in water level, reaching 293.44 meters, with a flow rate of 4,500 cubic meters per second. From the 15th to the 18th, the flow rate of the Yellow River's main and tributaries increased sharply, reaching 9,300 cubic meters per second. The floodwaters are vast and will soon reach Shandong. In addition to reporting to the Provincial Government, Zhang also issued a general order to all sections of the river to strengthen flood prevention. Therefore, there are still many hidden worries ahead. (20th)</p>

<p>Radio Bureau Handles Radio Registration</p>
<p>Recently, with the advancement of science, radios have become popular everywhere. According to regulations, users should apply for registration, but many users are unaware of the laws and regulations and have not applied. Since the Ministry sent personnel to Songjiang last month to investigate transmitters, they have realized the need to register radios and have applied to the Songjiang Telegraph Bureau. The bureau has submitted the matter to the Ministry of Communications and has been issued registration forms, allowing radio users to fill out and register. No handling fees will be charged within two weeks. Those who fail to register after the deadline will be fined according to regulations.</p>
<p>Post Office Investigates Private Transportation of Letters</p>
<p>Local people's bureaus are not allowed to transport letters. The Ministry of Communications has previously ordered local post offices to investigate in order to avoid hindering state-run operations. Although the people's bureaus jointly petitioned, their request was not approved. Recently, Yan Xiaolu, Director of the Zhangyan Post Office, learned that Wang Xieyuan Store in Tinglin and others were suspected of privately transporting letters. After investigation, two pieces of evidence were found. The store owner, Gu Binfu, was bedridden due to illness and was ordered by the Public Security First Branch to post bail. The bail documents were sent to the local court for investigation.</p>

<p>Repercussions of Police Arbitrarily Arresting Civilians</p>
<p>At about 10 p.m. on the 19th of this month, a sudden violent wind and rain struck the city. All the city's electric lights suddenly went out. Zhu Jiannan, a shop assistant at Qingxin Hat and Shoe Store under the North Suspension Bridge, used a flashlight to illuminate and ordered apprentices to go out and buy candles. Due to carelessness, the light shone on the face of Zhao Lunshan, a policeman at the Fifth Branch of the Public Security Bureau. The policeman cursed without asking the reason, and a dispute arose. Somehow, the policeman was beaten and immediately returned to the bureau to report. The bureau sent police officers to detain Zhu Jiannan, Zhu Shankang, Cai Jinliang, and others. They were beaten with fists and tied with ropes on the way. The next day, they were transferred to the County Public Security Bureau. Because it was Sunday, the case was scheduled to be transferred to the court for trial today. However, local merchants, because the police arbitrarily arrested merchants that night and beat and tied them, causing merchants to lose face, specifically requested the County Chamber of Commerce from various trade guilds to forward a letter to the County Government, ordering the Public Security Bureau to restrain its subordinates and prevent similar actions from happening again in the future in order to maintain the business community. The Da'an Township Office also sent a letter to the First District Office to forward to the county for handling in order to appease merchants and civilians.</p>
<p>Another Impersonator Arrested</p>
<p>The Sixth Company of the Second Battalion of the Second Regiment of the Garrison in Wuxi previously cracked a case involving Wu Yushan, Zhang Ling, Jiang Jun, and others impersonating military officers. They were sent to the Capital Garrison Command and the Suzhou Battalion Headquarters for interrogation. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Now, it is learned that Zhong Ruilin, the company commander of the company, recently discovered that Wang Xiaoxian (nicknamed Wang Datou), from Anhui, was also impersonating the leader of the Seventh Group of the Fifth Recruiting Office of the Military Commission. He established a recruiting office in the Sanyi Temple in Chong'an Temple, luring and threatening the ignorant to join the army, extorting money under various pretexts, and colluding with Wu Yushan. The company sent troops to arrest Wang, together with the Supervision Office of the Public Security Bureau, on the morning of the previous day. Many pieces of evidence were seized and temporarily detained in the company. Yesterday, they were sent to the Second Battalion Headquarters in Suzhou for interrogation.</p>

<p>To the Editor, We recently read the news about the Public Security Bureau of Haimen County interrogating Baozhang merchants in the "Local Correspondence" column of your newspaper on July 9. The current Inspector General of our bureau, Sun Junmou, was the director of the Sanyangzhen Public Security Sub-bureau. Because the gambling atmosphere in the town was rampant and the worst in the county, gamblers and hooligans ran rampant. Our bureau secretly ordered a deadline for suppression, and the law should be prohibited, and no leniency should be given. As for the fines for gambling, there are always joint receipts, which are reported to the county government by the bureau on a monthly basis. The drama in your publication that the job was lost because the receipts were not given for catching gambling is completely untrue. He Shudong, the former Inspector General of our bureau, resigned, and the officer was specially transferred to take over. It is also a very common thing in official affairs. Yin Xinbo, the acting director of the sub-bureau, was also manipulated by Zhou and other powerful gamblers in the town because of the strict prohibition of gambling and prostitution, and the market was closed. The handling beyond the rules and stimulating merchants and people to close the market as described in your publication is also untrue. Regarding the arrest of Gu Wugao, Li Bu'ao, Feng Furong, Ding Cailang, Shen Qinhe, etc., (Li Bu'ao is on the run and has not been captured) it is a major suspicion that they were arrested and investigated by the Nantong Commissioner's Office under a secret order. The injuries caused by interrogation are just that Gu and Ding were fined for gambling before, and they made false accusations to vent their personal anger. Otherwise, why have we not heard of any interrogation injuries to Feng and Shen, who were arrested in the same case at the same time? The Shishan Daily in our county has already confirmed it and does not need to be explained. Our bureau enforces the law strictly, impartially, and selflessly. It is inevitable that the villains hate it. Those who openly obstruct official duties and destroy reputation have violated the criminal law. Your publication is one of the leading newspapers in the country, and its records are known to be detailed and accurate. We should ask you to correct it immediately to match the facts, to fulfill the public interest.

According to Huang's statement to visiting reporters yesterday, his visit to Chengdu to see Chairman Chiang was solely to discuss the financial problems of Zhejiang Province, and there were no other missions. The central government has agreed to allocate two million yuan to make up for the shortfall in Zhejiang Province's budget for the previous year (Zhejiang Province had previously paid about four million yuan on behalf of the central government). As for Zhejiang Province's budget for this year, the shortfall between income and expenditure is estimated at about 1.8 million yuan, and a separate solution is needed to make up for it. Huang also spoke about the military and political situation in Sichuan Province. He said that since Chairman Chiang entered Sichuan to supervise the suppression, the communist bandits in Sichuan have been gradually suppressed, the bandit areas have gradually shrunk, and politics have returned to normal and construction has progressed.

<p>Riri News: Xu Fu, Member of the Fujian Provincial Government and Director of the Finance Department, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon from Fujian on a China National Aviation Corporation Guangdong Line northbound flight with his wife. He arrived at Longhua Airport at 3:30 p.m. After getting off the plane, Xu went to his residence to rest. At 4:30 p.m., he went to Zhangjia Garden to meet with Chen Yi, Chairman of Fujian Province, to report on Fujian's politics. A reporter from Riri News visited Mr. Yu at the hotel yesterday and recorded the following:</p>
<p>Mission to Shanghai to Meet with Chairman Chen</p>
<p>Xu first said, "The purpose of my visit is that Chairman Chen (Yi) of Fujian Province is in Shanghai, so I am specifically reporting to him on the recent political situation in Fujian Province. I will also have substantive discussions with the banking community in Shanghai on the issue of collateral for the newly issued construction bonds in Fujian Province. In addition, the Shanghai Municipal Bank has many accumulated debts, which need to be reorganized."</p>
<p>Construction Bonds to be Issued as Scheduled</p>
<p>"The total amount of the Fujian Province Construction Bonds is 3 million yuan. After being passed by the Legislative Yuan, they can now be issued as scheduled on August 1. The allocation of the funds, in addition to establishing a provincial bank with 1 million yuan, will be used to reorganize the Fujian Province banknotes with 700,000 yuan, because the banknotes in Fujian Province are extremely chaotic and need to be thoroughly reorganized. The remaining 1.3 million yuan will be used for transportation construction and rural relief projects."</p>
<p>Thorough Relief for Rural Areas in Fujian Province</p>
<p>"Fujian Province has suffered from banditry for a long time, and rural areas in various places are on the verge of bankruptcy. Chairman Chiang is particularly concerned about this and has ordered the establishment of a Rural Cooperative Committee to thoroughly relieve rural areas in various places and has ordered me to be responsible for organizing it. Preparations are now complete, and the personnel have also been determined. It will be established soon. This agency is under the jurisdiction of the General Headquarters."</p>
<p>Discussing Bond Collateral with the Banking Community</p>
<p>"Regarding the issue of collateral for the aforementioned bonds, I exchanged views with the banking community during my previous visit to Shanghai. However, because it had not been passed by the Legislative Yuan at the time, most of the discussions were vague. I plan to have substantive discussions with the banking community again in the next few days and proceed with all the procedures. There should be no problems in general."</p>
<p>Land Survey to be Completed by the End of the Year</p>
<p>"As for the finances of Fujian Province, after several months of reorganization by me, they have now begun to improve. The main task at present is the land survey, which is jointly handled by the Finance and Civil Departments. It has been quite smooth since the start, and it is estimated that it will be completed by the end of the year."</p>
<p>Local Security After Militia Reorganization</p>
<p>"The militia in various counties has now been completely reorganized, so the local area is quite peaceful. I am scheduled to return to Fujian on a China National Aviation Corporation plane on the 26th of this month, while my wife will return to her original home in Zhenhai in the coming days," and so on.</p>

<h3 id="e92">Mu Ouchu Requests Rectification: Letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Seeking Justice <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Mu Ouchu's letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce reads: Respected Sirs, I am writing concerning recent reports in the local evening paper of the 9th of this month and the daily newspaper of the 10th, regarding the case of *New Life Weekly* tried by the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court, and the publication of the court's verdict in various newspapers on the 16th. The verdict sentenced Du Chongyuan, the editor and publisher of the publication, to one year and two months of imprisonment, and announced in court on the 9th that no appeal would be permitted, with immediate detention and execution. I, Xiangyue, am not well-versed in the law, but upon investigation of the old and new penal codes, I find discrepancies with the court's pronouncements. I respectfully present my humble opinions as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The declaration "no appeal permitted" is illegal. According to Article 367 of the Criminal Procedure Law, "Anyone who disagrees with the second instance or first instance judgment of the High Court and appeals shall appeal to the Supreme Court." Furthermore, "The Supreme Court's trial of appeals against the first instance judgment of the High Court also applies the third instance procedure." Article 368 states, "Cases involving crimes listed in Article 61 of the Criminal Law, which have been judged in the second instance, may not be appealed to the Third Instance Court," explicitly stating "after the second instance," not "after the High Court." In this case, only the first instance of the High Court has been conducted. How can the court force the defendant to accept the verdict? The declaration of "no appeal permitted" clearly deprives the defendant of the right to appeal, violating the explicit text of the law.</p>
<p>(2) Failure to adopt a lighter penal code intentionally aggravates the harm to the actor. The author of the article "Idle Talk about the Emperor" is Yi Shui, who should bear the responsibility for the imprisonment. Du is the editor and publisher. On the day the article was published, Du was away in another city (as evidenced by various facts) and did not review the article. It was published due to the negligence of another editor of the publication. This cannot prove that Du was a joint actor. The circumstances are lighter, and should be punished with a fine of less than 1,000 yuan according to Article 325 of the old penal code and Article 310 of the new penal code. The purpose of a fine in the penal code is precisely for this reason. The court's abandonment of the lighter penalty that should have been applied and its decision on a heavier penalty that should not have been applied is, what else can it be, intentionally aggravating the harm to the actor?</p>
<p>(3) Not granting probation is inhumane. According to Article 74 of the New Criminal Law, "Anyone who has been sentenced to imprisonment, detention, or fines for a term of two years or less and who meets one of the following conditions, where it is deemed appropriate to temporarily suspend execution, may be granted probation for a period of two to five years, calculated from the date of final judgment: (1) has never been sentenced to imprisonment; (2) has previously been sentenced to imprisonment or a more severe punishment, and within five years after the completion of the sentence or pardon, has not been sentenced to imprisonment or a more severe punishment." Du is a self-respecting gentleman who meets both of the above conditions, and the author, Yi Shui, has not been arrested and brought to justice. It is entirely possible to "declare probation for two to five years." Moreover, Du has devoted himself to industry in recent years, sparing no effort, and is currently undertaking the important task of improving Jiangxi national porcelain. The law is ultimately rooted in human sentiment. The court's inhumane judgment of not granting "probation" is simply intolerable.</p>
<p>The above three points are not for Du Chongyuan alone to seek justice, but for the welfare of the three million citizens of Shanghai in the future, and I dare not remain silent. Recalling before 1927, our citizens suffered under the foreign-controlled Mixed Court. After much struggle and outcry, on January 1, 1927, we regained the Mixed Court and reorganized it into a provisional court. Furthermore, on April 1, 1930, we achieved the establishment of today's formal court. Unexpectedly, at the beginning of the implementation of the new penal code, a judgment depriving the right of appeal has occurred, intentionally depriving rights permitted by law. To tolerate this and not correct it would leave the property and lives of our three million citizens with no protection. If this is extended to the whole country, the depth of the future harm is unimaginable. Your esteemed association must be paying close attention to this case. My reason for not hesitating to state these points is merely to contribute to your association's research. If you would uphold justice and clearly indicate a method of rectification, the citizens would be greatly fortunate. Respectfully addressed to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Mu Xiangyue, July 19, 1935.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Sino-Philippine Relations Grow Friendlier: Overseas Chinese Welcome to Develop Mindanao: Overseas Chinese Entry Fees Reduced by Three-Quarters; Chinese Chamber of Commerce Decides to Assist in Protecting Local Products <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reports that Sino-Philippine relations in the Far East have become more harmonious and friendly in recent years, thanks to frequent visits between officials and people of the two countries. Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Association about the friendly relations between China and the Philippines, and the welcome extended by Filipinos to overseas Chinese to enter the Philippines and develop Mindanao. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Entry Fees Reduced to Five Pesos</p>
<p>Based on a special recommendation from the Governor-General to the Senate, Philippine Finance Minister Senator Quirino proposed to the Senate to reduce the immigration tax (i.e., entry fee) for overseas Chinese entering the Philippines from 20 pesos to 5 pesos. Mr. Quirino stated that China and the United States had recently agreed to reduce the visa fee for Chinese and American passports to 5 pesos per person, so the entry fee for overseas Chinese to the Philippines should also be reduced. He also said that the entry fee for Chinese coming to the Philippines was too expensive, and many tried their best to avoid it and move elsewhere.</p>
<p>Recruiting Chinese Laborers to Cultivate Mindanao</p>
<p>Philippine Chief of Staff General Basilio Valdes and Senator Mariano Cuenco recently visited Mindanao. General Manager of the Bureau of Non-Christian Tribes, Jose G. Generoso met with General Valdes. General Valdes asked General Generoso to submit a development plan for Mindanao and expressed his approval for General Generoso's previous proposals. General Generoso said that Filipinos were hesitant to develop Mindanao, and suggested seeking the consent of the Chinese government to recruit Chinese laborers to cultivate it.</p>
<p>Cooperation to Assist Economic Revival</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in the Philippines are pleased that the Philippine authorities have repeatedly expressed goodwill towards them, and they have decided to assist in protecting the national economy of the island. The Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Manila recently issued a notice stating: "The purpose of the Philippine National Economic Protection Association is purely to promote local products, reclaim rights and interests, and support the development of Philippine industry and commerce, consolidating the position of the national economy. The objectives are far-reaching. As it gradually expands in the future, the economic future of the Philippines will depend on it. Overseas Chinese doing business in this country, the advancement or decline of their business depends entirely on the strength or weakness of the Philippine national economic capacity. If we look at the situation in the Philippines a few years ago, when Philippine local products were thriving, all the large and small overseas Chinese merchants were full of vitality. As local product prices declined and production decreased in recent years, the overseas Chinese business also declined sharply. This is an obvious fact. It can be seen that the rise and fall of overseas Chinese business is closely related to the Philippine national economy. The association has recently received a letter from the Association expressing its sincere desire to cooperate with the overseas Chinese to jointly promote progress. Therefore, the association informs all overseas Chinese to provide practical cooperation and assistance."</p>
<h3 id="e94">World Bank Held Shareholders Meeting Yesterday: Resolution to Officially Liquidate; Jiang Yiping and Jiang Wanping Still Entrusted to Handle; Ministry of Finance Sends Tao Moqing to Supervise Liquidators <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>After the Shanghai World Commercial Savings Bank suspended business due to economic difficulties, the shareholders meeting yesterday resolved to officially liquidate. The Ministry of Finance has sent personnel to supervise. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Official Liquidation</p>
<p>The World Bank resolved to suspend business on July 4 due to economic difficulties. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 p.m., the bank held a shareholders meeting at the Shipping Club according to law. 69 households with 1,700 shares and 1,614 voting rights were present. Wang Shaohe was elected as chairman. It was resolved to officially liquidate, entrusting lawyer Jiang Yiping and accountant Jiang Wanping to handle the liquidation and registration of creditors and debtors.</p>
<p>Ministry Personnel Supervise</p>
<p>After the bank announced the suspension of business, it immediately submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance to send personnel to monitor. Upon receiving the report, the Ministry of Finance sent Tao Moqing to Shanghai yesterday to supervise the bank's liquidation. According to acting manager of the bank, Mr. Lin Junhe, the shareholders meeting has now approved the dissolution. The bank has decided to proceed with liquidation, requesting the lawyer to issue a notice for registration, to be completed within one month. The bank's deposits and loans, after offsetting, have a surplus. There is no problem with the depositors' deposits, he said.</p>
<h3 id="e95">He Fu, Liquidator of American United and Two Other Companies, Issues Statement: Poor Management of the Three Companies Created an Extremely Bad Situation <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The *North-China Daily News* reports that Mr. He Fu, the liquidator of the American United Bank and two other companies, issued a formal statement on Saturday (July 20th), stating that the liquidation process was proving difficult. The current commercial situation in Shanghai and the rest of China was not an insurmountable obstacle. The difficulties were due to the internal situation of the three companies and the poor management over the years. Taking American United Bank as an example, some of the external debts listed as assets were loans to affiliated companies. Those in charge of the bank must have known long ago that they were worthless. In addition, there were many external loans listed as assets that should have been written off as bad debts years ago based on ordinary commercial knowledge. Many loans had no collateral, or the collateral was worthless paper. Attributing the failure of the three companies to a poor business environment or Roosevelt's silver purchase policy was merely an excuse. The instability of the three companies' internal situation had been apparent for years. In his opinion, even if the general commercial situation today was good, the three companies would still have been forced into liquidation. The liquidation process cannot be completed quickly because the three companies created the current state of affairs over many years. The liquidation work cannot be completed in a short period of time. He often heard that American United Bank was an American bank, but it was actually a bank established in Shanghai by an American. It had no connection with any American bank and did not comply with American banking laws. Thousands of people who deposited money in the bank must have thought it was an American bank. The Tianjin branch was smaller in scope and in better condition. Except for a loan of 1 million yuan to the American Carpet Company, the remaining debts were being collected. Since Mr. Rook took over the liquidation, he has remitted 96,000 yuan. Even if the debts owed to the Universal Savings Society could be repaid, they would be few. The company had a very large amount of deposits, so the loss to creditors was terrifying. The amount of money that several companies owed to the American United Bank was nearly 2 million yuan. This money was wasted on useless places in the Universal Savings Society and the American Eastern Banking Corporation. As for the American Eastern Banking Corporation, it was a problem. The amount that creditors could recover in the future would be very small, because the securities pledged by the company were often re-pledged to other banks and a certain company in New York, resulting in an extremely bad situation. Those who owed money to the American Eastern Banking Corporation, even if they were willing to pay, could not get their pledged securities back. Since these securities had been re-pledged to other banks, the liquidator could not recover the securities to be returned to the original owners, even if he wanted to collect the money. In other words, the American Eastern Banking Corporation had no cash available for the liquidator to withdraw securities from other banks and return them to the original owners in order to settle the outstanding debts. Accountant Fold and his assistant are currently auditing and announcing the account books of the three companies and the Universal Real Estate Company. The actual situation of the four companies will be announced in detail within two months. According to the investigation, the amount of money that American United Bank invested in various projects on the day of closing was approximately 11,100,200 yuan. Since the liquidation, only 355,655.20 yuan has been recovered. The figures for the bank's investment in various projects proved that the commercial situation in Shanghai and Roosevelt's silver policy had little impact on the three companies. The failure was mostly due to poor management policies. Before the liquidation, the monthly expenses of the three companies were approximately 31,850 yuan. Since the start of the liquidation work, some of the employees of the three companies must be retained to assist in the process. The current monthly expenses are 9,709 yuan, including the salaries of Mr. Fold and his assistant. This is the minimum that can be saved. However, the remuneration of the liquidator's lawyer, Mr. Schuyler, and the liquidator himself will be determined by Chief Judge Hilemik of the American Court after the liquidation work is completed.</p>

<h3 id="e96">New Theory of Dada: Trial Run in Wusong Yesterday, Reception for Visitors; Perfect Equipment, Management System Eliminates Bad Habits; Maiden Voyage Tonight, Non-Commercial Traffic on Tongyang Line <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The Dada Shipping Company's new ship, Dada, had a trial run to and from Wusong at 1:00 p.m. yesterday and will host visitors this morning. The maiden voyage will be on the Tongyang line tonight, without carrying passengers or cargo. It is scheduled to officially open on the 26th. The previously leased Datong ship will be taken out of service. Details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Trial Run Ceremony</p>
<p>After the Dada new ship was completed by the Great China Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering Company, it sailed to Dada Wharf No. 5 on the 16th Pier and docked. The trial run ceremony was held at 1:00 p.m. yesterday. All the guest firms, colleagues, and journalists were invited to visit the ship. A temporary decorative archway was built at Wharf No. 5. More than 1,000 people, including Wang Bofen, Chen Shuntong, Li Yunliang, Penghu, Chen Yisheng, etc., attended. The company's managers Ma Shuren, Zhao Hansheng, Li Yunhou, Wu Bangsheng, General Manager Zhang Xiaoruo, Manager Yang Guanbei, and Shipping Section Chief Yang Qingbang, etc., welcomed the guests and provided tea and refreshments. Commemorative fans for the maiden voyage were distributed. The trial run started at 1:30 p.m. and arrived outside the Wusong estuary at 3:00 p.m. It then sailed back and docked at Wharf No. 5 at 4:30 p.m. The result of the trial run was very good.</p>
<p>Welcome Speech</p>
<p>General Manager Zhang Xiaoruo delivered a welcome speech on the ship, saying: "In this autumn of economic panic and the decline of all industries, our company still spared no expense to build a new ship at a huge cost of 500,000 yuan. Can the critics say that we do not understand the situation and that it is not in line with economic principles? But they do not know the company's hard work for transportation and its purpose of serving society, which does not slacken due to the adverse environment. Moreover, the business of the recent era is like a boat sailing against the current. If it does not have special strengths, it will inevitably fail. Our company is in this special environment. Although we want to work hard within the scope of our own business to seek development, external threats are constantly increasing and never ending, making it difficult to fully develop our strengths. It is difficult to improve and difficult to maintain the status quo. There is nothing more heartbreaking than this. However, our company will never be discouraged by this. With the spirit of struggling through hardships and fulfilling our most faithful responsibilities, we will make further contributions to the public and transportation. We resolutely decided to build this new ship to align the ranks of our company's ships. Today, the great success is announced. We are honored to have Chinese and foreign guests to guide us. It is a great occasion. In addition to our company's gratitude, we will briefly describe the structure, equipment, and management of the new ship Dada below, and humbly seek guidance.</p>
<p>Complete Equipment</p>
<p>The structure and machinery of the ship have already been reported in the newspapers, so I will omit the details. As for the equipment, it is very complete. (1) The special-class rooms and dining rooms are all decorated in Western style, painted with gold and colorful, magnificent and resplendent. The berths are Simmons flat steel beds, which are extremely comfortable. The sofas are all made of thick velvet, and hot and cold running water, dressing tables, coffee tables, bed blankets, and velvet bedding are all suitably matched. (2) The light and air in all levels of cabins are very sufficient. There are mosquito nets in summer and radiators in winter. The special-class rooms even have skylights with glass covers. (3) There are several men's and women's rooms on the upper, middle, and lower levels. The locations are appropriate and the boundaries are different, so they are never mixed. Flush toilets are used. (4) Hot water vapor pipes are installed in the front and rear cargo holds. In the event of a fire, the mechanism can be opened and hot steam will be sprayed from the pipes. Watchmen are hired to patrol to prevent accidents. Regarding life-saving equipment, there are four lifeboats and more than 1,000 life jackets, all made of high-quality materials. (5) To prevent pirate robberies, movable iron grilles are placed in the driving cabin and at the key points of each cabin, which can be closed immediately. The above equipment is the only one on the inner harbor route.</p>
<p>Management System</p>
<p>(1) The business management of this ship implements the abolition of the comprador system. One clerk is set up to manage passenger meals, teahouse reception, and the hygiene of the entire ship. A separate cargo handling department is set up to manage the loading and unloading of goods along the way and management matters. With this method, the head office can directly exercise its powers on each ship, which can thoroughly reform the business. (2) The teahouse staff of this ship are selected from the original teahouse staff of each ship and are strictly trained. They are attentive and quick in their work. They wear uniforms when serving on the ship to show neatness and magnificence. They are absolutely allowed to be rewarded by the guests for the liquor, and are never allowed to ask for a penny. (3) All levels of cabins are numbered in accordance with the railway method. Passengers can book seats by telephone and purchase tickets and board the ship at the company's ticket office on the pier before departure. They can board the ship according to the seat number. There is no bad habit of teahouse staff monopolizing berths like on the Yangtze River steamers. (4) Top-class chefs are hired for food, striving for cleanliness and deliciousness. The drinking water is filtered with fine sand leaks, which is more beneficial to hygiene than using alum to precipitate the water.</p>
<p>Reception for Visitors</p>
<p>Starting at 9:00 a.m. today, tea and refreshments will be prepared on the ship to welcome Wu Tiecheng, the mayor of Shanghai, the heads of various bureaus under his command, the heads of security departments, and industry leaders Chen Guangfu, Qin Runqing, Liu Hongsheng, Yu Zuoting, Lin Kanghou, Zheng Zenan, Wang Yansong, Yu Qiaqing, and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and other organizations. Chairman Du Yuesheng will personally host the event. The ship will dock at Wharf No. 5 on the 16th Pier. As for the crew, Zhang Shusheng has been appointed as the captain, Wu Shicai as the first mate, Zhu Lianqing as the second mate, Shen Liansheng as the chief engineer, Liu Yexing as the first engineer, Wang Shaofu as the second engineer, Zhou Shengdong as the third engineer, Bao Jinzhang as the cargo handler, and Jin Maoliang as the clerk. The comprador system will be abolished, a clerk will be set up, and a total of 34 teahouse staff will be hired. The company will pay them wages and prohibit them from extorting tips. The ship has six special-class cabins, each for two people, sixteen second-class cabins, each for two people, and 125 general-class seats, accommodating a total of 1,350 passengers.</p>
<p>Sailing to Tongyang</p>
<p>The ship is scheduled to make its maiden voyage from Shanghai to the Tongyang line at 12:00 tonight, temporarily without loading cargo or passengers. Manager Yang Guanbei, Shipping Section Chief Yang Qingbang, etc., will all travel with the ship. It will pass through Yaogang and Rengang without stopping. It is scheduled to arrive at Tianshenggang at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow, welcoming the Tongzhou community to board the ship for a visit. It will sail again that night, passing through Xinsheng, Zhanghuang, Xingang, Jiangyin, Liuxu, Dongxin, and Tianxingqiao without stopping. It is scheduled to arrive at the port of entry at 4:00 a.m. on the 24th. After stopping, it will sail again, passing through Sanjiangying and Bajiangkou without stopping. It is scheduled to arrive at Huojiaqiao at 9:00 a.m. on the same day and will begin loading cargo and passengers. It will depart from Huojiaqiao at 1:00 p.m. that afternoon and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 12:00 p.m. on the 25th.</p>
<p>Passenger Ticket Prices</p>
<p>It has been decided that the ship will officially start carrying cargo and passengers from Shanghai to the Tongyang line at 12:00 p.m. on the 26th, stopping at all ports of entry. The ship will depart from Shanghai every Monday and Friday. As for the passenger ticket prices, (1) special-class cabin is 4 yuan per person, (2) special-class dining room is 1.50 yuan per person, (3) first-class cabin is 1.50 yuan per person, (4) second-floor dining room is 1 yuan per person, (5) second-floor dining room cabin is 1 yuan per person, (6) second-class cabin is 75 cents per person, (7) general-class cabin is 50 cents per person. The above are all the ticket prices from Shanghai to Tongzhou. The prices to Yangzhou will be slightly higher. On the day that the Dada new ship starts service, the Datong ship of the Yixiang Shipping Bureau, which was previously represented by the Ping An Company, will be taken out of service and the lease will be terminated when the contract expires next year.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Rice Dealers Association: Important Notice to Colleagues Regarding the Inspection of Measuring Instruments <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Dealers Association issued a special notice to all colleagues in the city yesterday regarding the inspection of measuring instruments, stating: "This notice concerns the inspection of measuring instruments for the rice industry throughout the city by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Weights and Measures. Because the measuring instruments of various rice dealers have been altered, the Bureau of Weights and Measures has published a notice in the newspaper, requesting that the measuring instruments be sent to the Bureau for inspection within one month from June 20th. At the same time, the Association received instructions from the Bureau of Social Affairs. After repeated meetings of the executive and supervisory committees of the Association and repeated discussions, it was decided that if each rice dealer sends their own instruments for inspection, not only will there be no instruments available for sale, but the back-and-forth process will take a lot of time. If the measuring instruments are found to be unqualified, it will be impossible to modify them immediately. In order to facilitate the convenience of colleagues, the Association has sought and been granted permission from the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs to instruct the Bureau of Weights and Measures to send personnel to the Association to inspect the instruments. On the one hand, the Association will prepare replacement measuring instruments and send personnel to receive and issue them. If any measuring instruments are found to be unqualified after being altered, they will be corrected on the spot. The Association has also sought and been granted permission from the Bureau of Weights and Measures to exempt all altered measuring instruments from punishment during the inspection period. The notice has been filed with the entire organization. The inspection was officially started on July 9th. However, after this inspection, in order to prevent abuses, the Bureau of Weights and Measures will first divide all colleagues in the city, whether members or non-members, into districts in order by the Association, and number and mark each store as a unit. Then, the edge of each measuring instrument will be printed with a code, and then the inspection will be carried out. It is also stipulated that a qualified certificate for the inspection of measuring instruments with a hard seal will be issued by the Association along with the instrument, indicating that it is to be transferred by the Shanghai Rice Dealers Association. This certificate will classify each item and record the number and code. In the future, colleagues must bring the certificate to the Association when purchasing measuring instruments. If there is any damage, theft, transfer, etc., they must also bring the certificate to the Association to cancel the number and report the loss of the certificate to apply for a replacement. Otherwise, if the instrument number and quantity recorded on the certificate do not match, they will be dealt with according to law if discovered. All measuring instruments and certificates that were previously sent directly to the Bureau for inspection by each store number will be re-inspected and numbered by the Association, and the certificates will be replaced to ensure uniformity. After this major inspection, all of our colleagues must not alter the measuring instruments again, so as not to violate the law. You must know that the Association has taken great pains to protect its colleagues in order to have the convenience of today. However, in recent days, the Association has sent personnel to receive and issue measuring instruments, and it has been found that a small number of stores have altered too many measuring instruments and cannot be corrected. The Bureau of Weights and Measures found them to be unqualified and ordered that they must not be used again. Considering the situation, it is necessary to impose fines on each item. The Association has also requested exemption, but a small number of stores do not understand the situation and have forcibly detained the replacement measuring instruments of the Association, which is a great loss to the Association's intention to take care of its colleagues. Although these detained measuring instruments have been recovered by the Association one after another, it is feared that this will happen again in the future. The Association can only allow the Bureau of Weights and Measures to impose penalties on each item. Do not say that the Association has not fulfilled its responsibility to protect you. This notice is hereby given."</p>
<h3 id="e98">Minsheng and Butterfield &amp; Swire After Purchasing the Jijiang Ships, They Have Both Set Sail <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>After the American Jijiang Steam Navigation Company sold all of its ships to Minsheng and Butterfield &amp; Swire, it completed the closure. After the two companies received the ships, they changed the ship names and joined the upper reaches of the Yangtze River route. The state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is also preparing to restore the upper reaches route. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Jijiang Ends Business</p>
<p>The Jijiang Steam Navigation Company sold all of its ships, totaling 6,800 tons, including (1) five ships on the Shanghai-Yichang line: Yifeng, Qitai, Yixing, Xietan, and Yijiang; (2) five ships on the Shanghai-Chongqing line: Yian, Yiping, Qiping, Yichang, and Qichun, all handled by the American Huizhong Banking Corporation. They have all been handed over to the British Butterfield &amp; Swire Company and the private Minsheng Company. The company and its branch agencies in Zhangjiang ports have all been closed.</p>
<p>Minsheng Receives Vessels: Minsheng Industrial Company purchased seven ships: Gongtai, Yixing, Yijiang, Yian, Yichang, Gongchun, and Xietan. The names were changed and repainted. Now the Minyi wheel (formerly Yichang) has been repainted and set sail from Shanghai to Chongqing on the 19th. It is stipulated that it will make a round trip every twenty days. The remaining ships will be operating on the Shenyi, Yishen, Yuyi, Yuhan, Tonghe, Jiarong, Fuwan, Rongjia, Yuhe, and Yufu routes, respectively.</p>
<p>Butterfield &amp; Swire Expands: Butterfield &amp; Swire Steamship Company, which operates the Shanghai-Yichang line and the Shanghai-Chongqing line, was originally limited to Changsha, Shashi, Wuxue, and Yanhai. After purchasing Yifeng (2,605 tons), Yiping (654 tons), and Gongping (522 tons), etc., it decided to expand the upper reaches of the Yangtze River line and join the Shanghai-Yichang and Shanghai-Chongqing routes, as a regular direct release ship for loading cargo and passengers.</p>

<p>The economic conditions of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, once holding a superior position, have been declining in recent years due to the impact of the global economic downturn, far from their former state. Kong Xiangxi, the Minister of Finance, previously sent Xu Jianping, the Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry, to Southeast Asia to investigate the current state of economic decline among overseas Chinese, in order to provide assistance. After returning to China, Xu compiled a report on his findings and submitted it to the Ministry of Finance for instructions. It is now known that the Ministry of Finance has thoroughly studied Xu's report, formulated measures, and plans to implement relief efforts in the near future.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Heavy Rain in Shanghai Yesterday, Clearing Up in the Evening, Pests in the Fields Gone, Pacific Hurricane Loitering East of Taiwan <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>After 9 p.m. yesterday, it rained again in Shanghai, continuing steadily until midnight, stopping only after 2 a.m. this morning. Yesterday morning, a gentle breeze caressed people, and wisps of clouds brought coolness. However, by noon yesterday, dark clouds gathered again, and the climate was stifling. From 3 p.m. onwards, there were sudden showers five times. As of 4:30 p.m., it was still alternately sunny and rainy. After 4:45 p.m., it cleared up completely, and the climate dropped by more than four degrees compared to the previous day. Many pests in the cotton and rice fields in the suburbs were eliminated. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Five Showers</p>
<p>At 3 p.m. yesterday, a sudden torrential rain fell in the Shanghai concession areas. The raindrops were larger than the previous night. Because the wind direction was quite stable, the raindrops fell from the sky in straight lines. It lessened slightly at 3:15 p.m., and after three minutes, it became heavier again, reaching its heaviest at 3:23 p.m. By 3:30 p.m., it subsided again, and at 3:35 p.m., the rain passed and the sun came out from the clouds. At 4 p.m., it suddenly rained again, and by 4:10 p.m., the rain was as large as beans. It had not completely stopped by 4:30 p.m. After 4:45 p.m., the rain finally stopped and the sky cleared. Although thunderclouds had not dissipated in the northeast corner in the evening, the climate turned cooler, and there was no sign of rain. According to the Observatory's report, the highest temperature yesterday was 92.1 degrees, and the lowest was 75.6 degrees, a difference of 4.7 degrees compared to the previous day's 96.8 degrees, and a decrease of 8.7 degrees from the hottest temperature of 100.8 degrees.</p>
<p>Pests Eliminated</p>
<p>It is reported that yesterday's rain greatly benefited the cotton and rice fields in the suburbs. In the past week, after the climate turned hot, black larvae grew in the rice paddies (the water in the rice fields also became hot after the heat, so these insects grew, commonly known as oil bugs). There were also fireflies in the cotton fields, which, although not causing great damage, also hindered the growth of cotton. Since yesterday's rain, most of the insects that were about to grow and spread were knocked down by the raindrops.</p>
<p>Hurricane Update</p>
<p>According to the Xujiahui Observatory's report at 2 p.m. yesterday, the hurricane that originated in the Pacific Ocean on the 17th has been loitering east of Taiwan for four days. At 2 p.m. yesterday, it was located between 24.5 degrees north latitude and 125 degrees east longitude, with its direction being west-northwest, and its circumference still being 60 nautical miles.</p>

<p>Zhang Bingsheng, a native of Zhejiang, eleven years old, works as a small apprentice in a silver furnace on Yongxing Road, Zhabei. Yesterday morning, at around 9 a.m., Zhang and several neighborhood children were playing in a nearby wasteland when they accidentally found an egg-shaped bomb in the bushes. Zhang Bingsheng did not recognize what it was and happily took it home. It happened to be seen by a Sheng child named Jingsheng (ten years old) from No. 2 Yongxing Lane, who regarded it as a rare object and insisted on taking it from Bingsheng. While they were playing with it, they inadvertently dropped the bomb on the cement ground. Upon impact, it exploded with a loud bang, and iron fragments and flesh flew everywhere, smoke filled the air, and the smell of sulfur was pungent. Residents in the lane suddenly heard the loud noise and rushed out to investigate, seeing two children injured and lying in the lane. Sheng Jingsheng was covered in blood and gore, a gruesome sight, and died on the spot from severe injuries. Zhang Bingsheng's hands and feet were also injured by the explosion, and blood flowed profusely. The police officers on duty in the area also arrived at the scene upon hearing the noise. After seeing the situation, they reported to the Fire Brigade, which transported the dead and injured children to the Coroner's Office and the Chinese Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road for treatment. However, Zhang Bingsheng's injuries are also very serious, and his life may be in danger. The source of the bomb, after investigation and research by the police station in charge, is suspected to be left over from wartime.</p>

Attendees included Zheng Jianbo, Chen Jiufeng, Ma Yuanbai, Jin Wen, Su Guohun, Du Chunxun, Xiang Jianxiang, Liu Xiuchun, Yan Zuliang, Zhong Guifu, Yang Zhenchun, Shi Baoyan, Zhou Liankui, Fang Baolin, Zhang De, Lin Shaoyu, and representatives from Chengxin Lane Branch Association, Sida Lane Branch Association, Hongyuan Lane Branch Association, Tongle Lane Branch Association, Huaxing Lane Branch Association, etc., totaling more than 60 people. Zheng Jianbo, Bai Jinwen, Du Chunxun, Qiu Yaoshan, and Ma Yuan were publicly elected as the presidium of the meeting, and Wang Bingcheng was the secretary. After the rituals were performed, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, stating that "Today is the joint representative meeting of the branch associations of our Shanghai East District Rent Reduction Committee. We are very honored to have the enthusiastic participation of all representatives and branch associations. However, since the organization of the Rent Reduction Committee, it has been many months, and we feel that we have not achieved any results, which is truly regrettable. Now, because the social economy is in a slump and the decline of industry and commerce has reached its extreme, property prices have plummeted, and rents should be appropriately reduced. Therefore, we have called all of you representatives here today to discuss together how to alleviate the burden on tenants and to seek a support for the revival of the market. We hope that all of our representatives will pool their efforts to facilitate progress." Proposals decided upon: (1) Sida Lane representative proposed: This lane requests a reduction in rent and has repeatedly requested it from the landlord, but the landlord is not only unwilling to accommodate but also resolutely refuses to acknowledge it. The association should assist in this case. Resolved: The association will send a letter and dispatch Committee Member Cheng Juetian to directly negotiate with the landlord to alleviate the burden on tenants. Passed. (2) Committee Member Zheng proposed: The Chengxin Lane owner, Sincere Company, has agreed to reduce store rents by five yuan and lane rents by three yuan. Should the lawsuit be withdrawn? Resolved: The lawsuit will continue, and the association's legal counsel will appear in court to defend. Passed. (3) Jinyu Lane, Tangshan Road, requests to organize a branch association to participate in this case. Resolved: Permission is granted to organize and participate. Passed. (4) Huaxing Lane representative proposed: This lane requests a rent reduction and has already negotiated with the landlord, but there has been no result. The association should assist in this case. Resolved: Committee Members Bai Jinwen and Zhao Yongjun will be dispatched to negotiate directly with the landlord. (5) Committee Member Du Chunxun proposed: How should the association's publicity work be carried out? Resolved: Slogans will be printed and posted in each lane to promote awareness. Passed. (6) Committee Member Chen Jiufeng proposed: The association is also a complete organization of citizens and should be registered with the General Association, and then each lane should organize its own branch association to facilitate progress. Resolved: The matter will be handled by the Secretariat. (7) Committee Member Ma Yuan proposed: In addition to publicity slogans, it would be more beneficial to add a special publication on rent reduction in the Shanghai Fruits District. The public should decide on this. Resolved: It will be carried out as proposed. Passed. (8) The association plans to expand its organization. How should it be handled? Resolved: Ten more committee members will be added to facilitate expansion. Passed. (9) Committee Member Qiu Yaoshan proposed: How should the association's finances be managed? Resolved: Committee Member Zheng will draft a budget, which will be passed at the next Executive Committee meeting. The meeting adjourned at 11 a.m.</p>
<p>Tenant Representatives of Dean Lane: Since the January 28th Incident, the market in the Hongkou District of Shanghai has not recovered. Recently, shops and residents along Suzhou Road, North Shanxi Road, and Tiantong Road have united to organize a rent reduction movement due to the sluggish market conditions and heavy burden, especially the large expense of rent. They have requested the assistance of the 15th and 36th Branch Associations of the Municipal Federation to achieve the goal of rent reduction. As a result of the efforts of the two branch associations, Mr. Bei Runsheng, the owner of Xintai'an Lane, has agreed to a 20% discount on store rents and a 10% discount on residential rents. The association, considering that Xintai'an Lane has made a clear statement, will seek the opinions of the majority. Yesterday, it notified all shops and residents in the lane that if they are not satisfied with the degree of rent reduction offered by the owner, they can submit their opinions to the association. As for the residents of Dean Lane on Suzhou Road, because the owner has not made a clear statement, an emergency meeting of Dean Lane representatives was convened at 3 p.m. yesterday. More than 20 representatives, including Shen Anqing, Tian Daiting, Qiu Minzhong, Ye Ping, Wang Yucheng, Jiang Zonghai, Zong Hai, Lu Rongtang, Yang Runsheng, Song Wenzheng, and Fan Sunfu, were present. Xu Kaixian was publicly elected as chairman. Four measures were decided upon: (1) Rent will not be paid until the goal of rent reduction is achieved. (2) The minimum rent reduction should be 30%. (3) Rent money will be deposited in a bank for safekeeping. (4) The owner of the neighboring Xintai'an Lane has offered an 20% rent reduction, while the owner of this lane is simply procrastinating. The Municipal Federation should be requested to seriously step in to alleviate the burden. The meeting adjourned at 5 p.m.</p>
<p>Food District Branch Association of the Municipal Federation: The Food District Branch Association of the First Special District of the Municipal Federation has repeatedly received requests from all tenants of Dean Lane to negotiate a rent reduction with the owner. Therefore, a meeting of the Executive Committee was held at 4 p.m. yesterday to discuss measures. More than ten committee members, including Wan Xuanqing, Gu Wensheng, Chuan Longcai, Shen Baonan, Zhu Youchun, and Zhu Zhichun, were present. Changwei Zhu Zhichun was publicly elected as chairman, and the purpose of the meeting was reported. The following was discussed and resolved: (1) This association will advise the shops and residents of Dean Lane to wait patiently for this association to negotiate a solution with the owner. (2) A message will be sent to the China Business Company to convey the owner's rapid statement. (3) If necessary, representatives will be sent to discuss with the owner in person to avoid escalating the situation. (4) "Confidential" Other matters were not discussed, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Continued Trial of the Murder of a Gatekeeper and Policeman in Fuxili, Tianjin Road - The Deceased Took a Woman into an Empty House, and the Murderer Argued for Locking It, Leading to a Dispute - Another Policeman Testifies in Court <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Wang Tongchun, a thirty-five-year-old native of Haizhou and gatekeeper and policeman at No. 35 Fuxili, Tianjin Road, had a minor quarrel with Shen Lianfa, a native of Shandong and gatekeeper at Qingcheng Qianzhuang No. 1589 in the lane. Wang immediately drew his gun and fired four shots, killing Shen. Wang was detained by Chief Detective Wu Yaozu and Detective Zhu Wanjun of the General Patrol Room and handed over to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. This was previously reported in this newspaper. The trial was continued in the First Criminal Court by Chief Criminal Judge Qian Hongye of the First Special Court. First, the police lawyer Jiang Baolian stated that during the adjournment, the police had inspected the handgun worn by the deceased, and the results proved that it had not been fired recently. Next, Witness Bu Ganting, policeman No. 996, testified that one or two days before the incident, the deceased had taken five or six women into an empty house at No. 6 in the lane. After being seen by the defendant, the defendant ordered Shen Gengsheng, the lane manager, to lock the empty house, causing a disagreement between the two. I intervened to mediate, so at the time of the incident, I advised the defendant not to lock the empty house, because the weather was hot, and if the house was locked, colleagues would have no place to rest. While we were talking, the deceased happened to arrive, and his face was not very good. The defendant snorted, and the deceased turned back, his face even worse. The defendant also stepped forward, and soon after, several gunshots were heard. I did not see the deceased fire his gun at that time. When questioned, the defendant stated that the deceased cursed at me first, then put his hand on his gun holster, as if he wanted to draw his gun and shoot me, so I preemptively shot him. He also hired lawyer Jiang Chiping to defend him, saying that the defendant also had several wounds on his body and may have been involved in a mutual fight at the time. The court ordered a postponement to further investigate whether Wang Tongchun had any injuries and should be sent for forensic examination.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Unable to Support His Family After Being Unemployed for a Long Time, Wang Afu Commits Suicide, Separated from His Legal Wife for a Long Time, and Often Quarrels with His Concubine <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Wang Afu, a native of Zhenhai, Ningbo, thirty-one years old this year, married a fellow villager Zhu (twenty-six years old this year) as his wife and had three children. Wang used to be a fireman on a ship, but he has been unemployed for many years. Because of discord between husband and wife, Zhu led her children to live at No. 3 Xiangshan Lane, Yanjia Pavilion Road, Zhabei, and worked in a printing factory to make a living. Wang had an affair with Pan Meixiao (twenty-three years old this year) from Xiashi, and they lived together at No. 11 Yinyu Lane, Bafang Bridge, French Concession. Pan was originally a prostitute and now raises several young prostitutes as private prostitutes for a living. Wang was supported by Pan. Recently, because he had been unemployed for a long time and had no money to subsidize his family, he often quarreled with his concubine. Wang had a sudden impulse to commit suicide. At 4:30 a.m. on the 20th, he suddenly got up and went outside, secretly swallowing poison to commit suicide. About half an hour after taking the poison, he still went home and lay down, crying incessantly. Only then was he discovered by his concubine, Pan MeiQing, who immediately sent him to Renji Hospital. Because he had been poisoned too deeply, the rescue was ineffective, and he died at 0:30 p.m. that afternoon. The hospital reported to the police station, which sent detectives to investigate the cause of the deceased's suicide. At the same time, the body was taken to the Tongren Funeral Home for autopsy. The concubine notified the deceased's wife and brother, Wang Genlin, to come. Yesterday, the police station reported to the Special Court, and Prosecutor Wang Ren and a forensic medical examiner went to the funeral home in the morning to examine the body. The court was set up after the case was reported by the Bao detective. The official asked the deceased's wife and concubine about the cause and course of the deceased's suicide. The deceased's wife, Wang Zhu, wished to claim the body for burial. The official then announced that Wang Afu had indeed died by taking poison before his death. The body was handed over to the deceased's wife for burial after she signed a guarantee.</p>

<p>Pan Zhongjia, the Shanghai County Magistrate, has been approved to resign, and Ye Zhendong, the Magistrate of Zhenjiang County, has been transferred to succeed him by the provincial capital. In recent days, Magistrate Pan has ordered the sections to rush to complete the handover procedures overnight. Mr. Ye was originally scheduled to take office on the 18th, but because the handover in Zhenjiang was not completed, the date was changed to the 22nd. He has now arrived in Shanghai from Zhenjiang and immediately notified the Shanghai County Government that he would take office today. It is noted that Magistrate Ye, with the given name Xinheng, is a native of Fujian and has served in the police force for many years. In 1933, he served as an inspector of the Department of Civil Affairs and later as the Commissioner of the Ninth District, concurrently serving as the County Magistrate of Nantong. He was transferred to serve as the County Magistrate of Zhenjiang.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Wu Huanru of the Bureau of Social Affairs Discusses the Shortening of the Pledge Period, Which Has Been Carefully Considered. The Decline of the Pawnshop Industry in the Urban Area in Recent Years is True, and the Investigation Will Be Signed and Submitted to the Bureau Chief for Decision <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Pawnshop Association, in order to reduce the operating losses of pawnshops at all nine levels, has specially submitted a request to the Bureau of Social Affairs for permission to shorten the pledge period from eighteen months to twelve months in order to maintain operations. The submission has been made and representatives have been sent to petition, hoping to achieve this as soon as possible. A reporter from Dagong Newspaper met with Wu Huanru, the section chief of the Second Section of the Bureau of Social Affairs, yesterday and asked about the latest developments in the case and whether it was possible to approve it. According to Wu, the proposal of the Pawnshop Association to shorten the pledge period had been submitted to the Bureau half a year ago. This move would have a great impact on the livelihood of the poor. Without careful consideration and understanding of the livelihood of the poor in both the Chinese and foreign concession areas, it would have a great impact. There are two views among the industry on shortening the pledge period: one insists on maintaining the original period (i.e., eighteen months, mostly industry in the concession area), and the other insists on changing it to twelve months. In the future, if the government approves twelve months, then the industry will have the freedom to operate, either according to eighteen months or fifteen months, which should not be a problem. If the government orders the original pledge period to be followed, then the industry cannot arbitrarily shorten the number of months. Therefore, the Bureau has truly understood the decline and significant losses of the pawnshop industry, but it cannot be denied that once the pledge period is shortened, the harm to the poor will be unavoidable. The details have been signed and submitted to the Bureau Chief for review and approval, and a direct reply will be given in the future, or it will be submitted to the Municipal Affairs Conference for discussion, and the decision will be made in accordance with the Bureau Chief's decision.</p>
<h3 id="e115">The Civil and Criminal Divisions of the Higher Court Third Branch Will Each Have a Presiding Judge <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>When the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court was established in August 1931, it originally had civil and criminal divisions, each with two presiding judges and judges working. Since the January 28th Incident, the changes have been changed to civil and criminal divisions, with one presiding judge and three judges handling civil and criminal appeal cases. It is heard that since the implementation of the three-level three-trial system on July 1st of this year, the number of civil and criminal appeal cases will inevitably increase, and the original method of establishing separate civil and criminal divisions, each with its own presiding judge, will be changed. The presiding judge of the civil division will be Mr. Guo Dezhang, the current presiding judge, and the presiding judge of the criminal division will be concurrently held by President Liang. Now, because Judge Sun Honglin of the Criminal Division has been transferred to the Supreme Court for three months and has not yet returned, the old rules will be temporarily maintained. Presiding Judge Guo will concurrently serve as the presiding judge of the criminal division. Roughly from August 1st, after Mr. Sun returns to Shanghai, Mr. Guo will serve as the presiding judge of the civil division, and Mr. Sun will serve as the presiding judge of the criminal division. The two judges in each division will remain unchanged.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of summer, the municipal health authorities have been actively engaged in epidemic prevention. Personnel have been dispatched by the Municipal Health Bureau to administer injections in schools throughout the city. As schools have now closed for the summer vacation this month, the focus has shifted to administering injections in factories and slums. According to sources at the bureau, there have been very few epidemic diseases in the city since the beginning of summer, and no cases of cholera have been discovered. There were rumors of cholera cases in the Songjiang area, but these have not been confirmed. The bureau has instructed the Caohejing area in western Shanghai to pay special attention to epidemic prevention to prevent the disease from entering the city. The weather has been cooler recently, and the number of heatstroke cases has decreased compared to before. Therefore, this summer can be considered very peaceful. The bureau's epidemic prevention campaign is currently focused on administering injections in factories and slums, and the work is extremely intensive. Recently, from the 16th to the 20th of this month, injections were administered in 81 factories. Including those injected previously, the total number exceeds 200. The British-American Tobacco Company in Pudong and Hongkou has sent letters to the bureau requesting that personnel be dispatched to administer injections. The bureau is currently planning to implement this within the week. The disinfection of riverbanks and stagnant water in the city is continuing, using kerosene and glass fragments as disinfectants. Personnel are dispatched daily to disinfect, to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes and other bacteria that endanger the health of citizens.</p>

Since the closure of the Shanghai National Goods Company, the only place to promote domestic goods is the China National Goods Company. This association feels that the places for promoting domestic goods are declining. Now that the World Fair is continuing, it is truly a good phenomenon for the domestic goods industry. We are sending this letter to your factory for your consideration. We hope that you will participate enthusiastically and make this a grand event. In addition, the Shanghai East Exhibition, which is organized by the association, is located at the corner of Linping Road and Tianbao Road. The location is convenient for transportation and densely populated, making it the most prosperous area in eastern Shanghai. It is currently being decorated and is scheduled to open on the 26th. It is reported that there are still several booths available, and domestic goods factories are invited to participate."</p>
<h3 id="e120">Clothing Industry Complies with Advice to Renovate, But is Still Sued for Illegal Roadside Display; Citizens' Association Sends Letter to First Special District Court Requesting Exemption from Punishment Due to Unreasonable Oppression by Municipal Council <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The Second Branch of the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Association, on behalf of its members Tong Zhenhe and 17 other stores, states that they have complied with the Municipal Council's notice and removed and renovated their clothes racks and signs within the deadline of the 14th. However, the Municipal Council has sued them in the First Special District Court for illegal roadside display, which is considered unreasonable oppression. The association has sent a letter to the First Special District Court requesting exemption from punishment to alleviate the hardship of businesses, and plans to request assistance from the Chinese Ratepayers Association and the Citizens' General Association. The original letter is transcribed below: "We have received letters from our members Tong Zhenhe, Yuan Fengsheng, Yuan Shun, Yuan Changsheng, Tong Fengsheng, Sanhe, Tong Yonghe, Yuan Tai, Yuan Sen, Rui Shengxiang, Sen Yuanxiang, Hua Zhang, Sen Hexiang, Shuang Sheng, Heng Fengqin, Pinghe, Tong Shunhe, and Xu Fengtai, stating that on the 11th and 12th of this month, they received a notice from the Works Department of the Municipal Council stating that the clothes racks and signs installed in front of their stores extended beyond the building line, violating the land regulations. They were given 14 days to remove or renovate them according to the notice, or face fines. After receiving the notice, our members complied and completed the removal and renovation within the deadline. We thought the matter was over. However, on the 20th, they suddenly received summons from the First Special District Court, stating that the police station was suing them for displaying too many clothes on the sidewalk, causing an illegal roadside display. The court summonsed them for trial on the 23rd and 24th of this month. After receiving the summons, they were very surprised. Our members complied with the notice and renovated and retracted their displays within the deadline, without exceeding the deadline. Why would the Municipal Council suddenly sue them in court? This is deeply suspicious. Our members operate clothing stores and originally displayed clothing samples to facilitate customer selection and purchase. This has been the practice for decades. Now, suddenly being prohibited from displaying clothes will greatly affect their business. Moreover, in this time of extreme economic depression, businesses are collapsing and in danger. It is difficult to operate a business. However, the Municipal Council authorities do not understand the hardship of the citizens within the concession and repeatedly interfere, prohibiting the display of clothes and signs, making it difficult for our members. The police station's accusation of displaying too many clothes is an advertising matter in business. It is difficult to construct a case of illegal roadside display. The height of the display is appropriate and does not cause any obstruction. Why should it be prohibited? Moreover, the court summons on the 23rd and 24th of July will punish them for illegal display, indirectly affecting their business and directly imposing fines. How can they bear this unexpected burden? Your association is a citizens' organization dedicated to promoting the welfare of citizens. Therefore, we earnestly request that you negotiate with the Municipal Council to allow the display of clothing samples in front of their stores, as long as it does not obstruct pedestrians, and to request the court to exempt them from punishment. The above is the situation presented. In view of the fact that these stores complied and automatically renovated and retracted their displays within the 14-day deadline, and did not exceed the deadline, they should not be subject to punishment for illegal display. Correspondingly, we request your court to order the police court to exempt them from punishment to alleviate the hardship of businesses and benefit the community. We extend our public friendship. This is addressed to Guo, President of the Shanghai First Special District Local Court (remaining text omitted)."</p>

<h3 id="e123">Tobacco and Candy Industry Asks Dacheng Company to Unify Supply of "Guben" Brand Soap <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The South Shanghai Office of the Tobacco and Candy Trade Association has sent a letter to the General Manager of Wuzhou Guben Soap, Dacheng Company, stating that "We have received reports from various members stating that your company, in view of the recent soaring foreign prices, is temporarily providing five extra boxes of 'Guben' soap for every 100 boxes purchased, which is commendable. However, the fact that the extra boxes are not provided to those who purchased from fellow tradesmen before the 16th of this month is contrary to the original intention. Small stores with limited capital are unable to purchase directly from the company and must purchase from wholesale tradesmen. They have not received the extra boxes when requesting them. This company's treatment of fellow tradesmen is unfair. Wholesale tradesmen receive the extra boxes and can sell them cheaply. Retail stores that have inventory do not receive the extra boxes and are unwilling to sell them cheaply, resulting in business losses. Recently, similar goods have been increasingly sold in the market. If the selling price of 'Guben' is not unified, the future of the business will inevitably be affected. Therefore, we are sending this letter to your office requesting that you forward the above situation to the company and request that it unify the supply to ensure fairness and avoid disputes." The office has stated that various tradesmen and your company are in the same boat and have a close relationship. Therefore, we are sending this letter to you for your consideration and reply so that we can inform them.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Shanghai Transportation Company: Zhoupu Station Manager Accused; Old Incident from Several Months Ago Re-Examined; Zhu Lie and Others Sue for Assault <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The small ferry of the Puddong Huinan Company runs between Nanhui and Zhoupu Town every hour. The small train of the Shangnan Transportation Company connects to it, going directly to Zhoujiadu, and then passengers take a ferry to Shanghai. Joint tickets are sold. At 5:00 PM on January 2nd of this year, the Huinan small ferry, carrying 70 or 80 passengers, including men, women, children, and the elderly, arrived at Zhoupu from Nanhui as usual. However, the water level was low that day, making it difficult to operate, and the small ferry's engine was also damaged. Due to these various reasons, it was delayed. It was not until after 7:00 PM that it arrived at Zhoupu, but the last small train from Zhoupu had already departed (it usually departs at 6:05 PM, but was delayed until 6:30 PM to wait for the last small ferry). The passengers had no train to ride, so they protested to the Zhoupu Town Station, saying that since their tickets were joint tickets, they should be sent to Shanghai, and should not be abandoned halfway, disregarding passenger safety. The noise was deafening. Zhou Ziguan, a patrol officer from the First Sub-Precinct of Zhoupu Town, came to maintain order and repeatedly comforted the passengers. He also reported to Wu Fuqing, an engineer from the Shangnan Transportation Company, by telephone. The company sent a special vehicle to transport the passengers to Zhoujiadu, which was already after 10:00 PM. Upon arriving at the dock, the city ferry had also stopped running. They could only hire four ferries to transport the passengers to the Gaochangmiao Wharf in Shanghai to disembark. The windows and shutters of several small train cars in Zhoupu were arbitrarily destroyed by unknown persons. When a dispute arose, the passengers elected four representatives to negotiate with the company. Because of the unfortunate incident of the train cars being damaged, the four representatives were detained, and the rest of the passengers were transported to Shanghai. The police then took the four representatives, Zhu Lie, Tan Nianfeng, Ling Yulong, and Cai Chengda, to the Yangsiqiao Sub-Precinct. Patrol Officer Xiao Jingfu treated them well (because the four representatives were intellectuals, either teachers or university students). However, due to the late hour and the snowstorm, it was not convenient to transfer them that night, so they were temporarily detained at the sub-precinct overnight. The next day, Officer Xiao summoned Dong Yaolong, a representative from the Shangnan Transportation Company, along with Zhu Lie and the other three, and escorted them to the Tangqiao Police Station. After interrogation, Chen, a guarantor, released Zhu Lie and the others on bail. Unexpectedly, after several months, Zhu Lie and the others have recently sued Shi Muzhao, the station manager of Zhoupu Station of the Shangnan Transportation Company, for assault and obstruction of freedom in the local court. (After this incident, the board of directors of the Shangnan Transportation Company suspended the station manager Shi Muzhao for three months for negligence. He has now completed his suspension and has resumed his duties.) Yesterday, Prosecutor Li Fen ordered Patrol Officer Zhou Yuguang of the First Sub-Precinct of Zhoupu and Patrol Officer Xiao Jingfu of the Yangsiqiao Sub-Precinct to appear in court to be questioned separately about the circumstances of the incident. The questioning was very detailed. As a result, the two patrol officers were ordered to return to their posts. If necessary, they will be summoned again.</p>

She was discovered by her cohabitants. The woman's limbs were cold and her breath was faint. They reported it to the nearby patrol station, which sent detectives to the scene. The woman was taken to the hospital for treatment. It is reported that she took too much poison, and her life is in danger.</p>
<p>Pills: At approximately 6:00 AM yesterday morning, in Room 48 of the Lao Dongfang Inn at the intersection of Zhejiang Road and Hankou Road, a lodger who identified himself as Yang Zhijun, 21 years old, a local from Huizhou, was a second comprador on the Taikoo Company's Huizhou steamer, residing at No. 16, Puqing Lane, Gongping Road. The tea house worker discovered him moaning and groaning in pain. He broke open the door and entered. The lodger's face was pale and he was delirious. An empty bottle of sedative pills was found beside his pillow, indicating that he had taken poison. He immediately ran to the accounts room to report it and used an ambulance to transport him to Renji Hospital for resuscitation.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of summer, the climate has changed drastically, and there have been many patients. If medication is not taken carefully, it can lead to disaster. Recently, the wife of Judge Song Qing of the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court in Sichuan, and the wife of Mr. Yang Youheng of the First Special District Court in Hebei, were successively infected with seasonal illnesses. Their conditions worsened after taking medication, and they suffered greatly. After being introduced by a friend, they were treated by Changsha Li Shaoguang, a spiritual therapist. Fortunately, he was able to cure them quickly. Recently, Miss Li Huifu, the fifth daughter of Judge Li of Guangxi, who resides at No. 1, Heng'ai Lane, West Iams Road, also suffered from a severe fever and rheumatism. She had been bedridden for more than ten days, and medication had little effect. She also suffered from chest pain and shortness of breath, making her condition very dangerous. Doctor Shaoguang was invited to diagnose and treat her, and she was able to recover day by day. Remarkably, when her condition was severe, her body temperature was as high as 38.5 degrees Celsius. Li did not use needles or medicine and only treated her for five days, bringing her temperature down to 36.8 degrees Celsius. She is now eating and sleeping normally and is happy and cheerful. It is truly amazing. Mr. Li is well-versed in spiritual therapy and has been in Shanghai for many years with outstanding results. As a result, many celebrities, such as Xu Shiying, Zhao Hengti, Zhang Taiyan, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, and Wang Yansong, have signed introductions for him. His universal relief from suffering and his efforts to prolong life are invaluable to society. Getting this good doctor can supplement what other needles and medicines cannot, which is beneficial to society. Mr. Li resides at No. 41, Garden Lane, Golden Father Road. He is at home in the mornings.</p>

<p>To the esteemed Editor of the Shenbao: In reference to the news item published in your newspaper on the 18th regarding the discovery of a true case of cholera, on the 17th, a reporter from a news agency called to inquire about the recent epidemic prevention situation. Our hospital's office informed them that a patient had come to the hospital for treatment, which was mistakenly taken to be a cholera patient. Furthermore, stool samples from our hospital's inpatients are sent to the Public Works Department and the Municipal Health Bureau for testing. How dare we make reckless speculations and publish them arbitrarily? Also, we were even more surprised to read the remarks attributed to our hospital's director in your esteemed publication, stating that cholera patients must receive a preventive inoculation. Upon investigation, our hospital's director did not make any such statement. Furthermore, our hospital is named the Chinese Epidemic Hospital, and the director is Mr. Wang Boyuan, who does not hold any position at the Hongkou Epidemic Hospital. We fear this will cause confusion and misunderstanding, so we are writing to request a correction. Respectfully, The Chinese Epidemic Hospital, July 21st</p>
<h3 id="e140">Special Article   Simple Life Insurance and Social Insurance (3) <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Mingxin</p>
<p>(1) State Monopoly: Japan, in light of the fact that the British simple life insurance was not exclusively operated by the state, leading to its decline and failure, took into consideration its own national conditions from the outset and made changes. It was designated as a state-run enterprise, utilizing the existing 7,000-plus post offices throughout the country to handle this business. This saved expenses and made the business easier to popularize. Therefore, since its inception, it has progressed extremely rapidly, becoming a successful example of state-run simple life insurance.</p>
<p>(2) Purpose Not for Profit: Simple life insurance is a social undertaking. The insured are mostly middle and lower-class people with limited financial resources. Although the premiums paid are not much, every drop comes from savings from hard work. In addition to operating expenses, ordinary life insurance companies must also consider the dividends for their shareholders, which increases the burden on the insured, contrary to the original purpose of simple life insurance. Therefore, the huge profits earned by companies in various European and American countries that also operate simple life insurance are a major reason for criticizing private simple life insurance. Furthermore, the result of their mutual competition is that the less-informed public does not know what to do, and premiums increase, causing more contracts to lapse, which inevitably affects the business itself and poses a danger. Therefore, state-run simple life insurance, not aiming for profit and having no additional expenses, can naturally reduce the burden on policyholders. If there is a surplus, it can all be used for the welfare of policyholders. This is why Japan, at its inception, based it on the realization of social policies and designated it as a non-profit business.</p>
<p>(3) Regulations on the Use of Accumulated Funds: Accumulated funds are the premiums collected from the efforts of many policyholders to save money. They are kept by the insurer to generate interest, in preparation for future payment of insurance amounts. Ordinary life insurance companies often use their accumulated funds for investments with high interest rates, but do not consider whether the investments are beneficial to policyholders. Japanese simple life insurance, being state-run and aiming not for profit, naturally has a different approach to the use of its accumulated funds. Therefore, at the time of its establishment, it was stipulated that it should be used for investments that are beneficial to the public, and an investment committee was established to oversee it. The method of returning funds to their source is also used to avoid concentrating them in one place. This is to take from the people and use for the people. The scope of investment includes elementary schools, hospitals, public housing, rural projects, water conservancy projects, public employment agencies, nurseries, and more. Simple life insurance can directly foster a spirit of thrift and savings among the public, and obtain insurance benefits with a small amount of money. Indirectly, it can also promote national economic and material construction, and promote social prosperity, which is very clear.</p>
<p>(4) Independent Accounting: In order to solidify the foundation of the business and prevent it from being affected by other national finances, the accounting of Japanese simple life insurance is stipulated to be independent and not mixed with other national accounts. In 1916, the Simple Life Insurance Special Accounting Act passed by the Imperial Parliament stipulated that the revenue of simple life insurance should be used to cover its expenditures. The revenue items are insurance premiums and income generated from accumulated funds, while the expenditures are insurance payments, redemption fees, business expenses, and other expenses. It is also stipulated that when the revenue is insufficient, it can be subsidized by the accumulated funds. Except for the first year (actually six months) when the contract performance exceeded the forecast by more than double, resulting in a budget deficit and a subsidy of more than 60,000 yuan from the accumulated funds preserved by the national treasury, the growth of its accumulated funds is truly amazing. Over the years, the terms and conditions for policyholders have also become increasingly favorable, which is enough to prove that its accumulated funds have exceeded the reserve liability.</p>
<p>(5) Health Facilities: The main purpose of life insurance, in addition to protecting against family economic losses and increasing social wealth, is also to extend the life of the insured. Modern life insurance companies in various countries spend huge sums of money each year to improve the health of policyholders. Extending the life of the insured reduces the mortality rate, while also increasing the productivity of society, which is of great benefit to the life insurance business itself. From its inception, Japanese simple life insurance paid attention to the health of the insured and actively researched various appropriate facilities. By 1922, as its business had become stable and developed, it first established seven health examination centers throughout the country. By 1934, it had gradually increased to 175 centers. More than 4.2 million people have used these facilities. The types of facilities are divided into five categories: (1) health examination centers, (2) printing of health publications, (3) health and hygiene propaganda, (4) creation of national health exercises, and (5) cooperation in tuberculosis prevention campaigns. The Central Health Examination Center is located in the Simple Insurance Bureau and is the largest in scale. Its nature is no different from the local examination centers, but it does not provide home nursing services because the center is actually responsible for handling matters that are difficult to implement locally, such as expensive medical equipment, blood serum tests, and various testing facilities. Currently, counting all 175 centers nationwide, there are 203 doctors, 417 nurses, 22 X-ray staff, and 154 other employees. The annual expenditure for each center is set at 10,000 yuan, for a total annual expenditure of 1.75 million yuan, which is undoubtedly a huge benefit to policyholders.</p>
<p>6.  The Process of Preparing for Simple Life Insurance in Our Country</p>
<p>Our country is an economically backward country. Since being affected by the global recession, industry and commerce have declined daily, and the rural areas are on the verge of bankruptcy. Furthermore, foreign troubles are frequent, without a single peaceful day. Natural disasters such as floods and droughts come one after another, and the precarious situation is like a pile of eggs. Fortunately, in recent years, the campaign to suppress bandits is about to be completed, local order is gradually becoming peaceful, and construction projects are progressing daily. It is the awakening and arduous struggle of the Chinese people. Overcoming difficulties and building the country is not an unachievable goal. As the ancients said, "Three years of farming yields one year of savings, and nine years of labor yields three years of storage." Then, the simple life insurance business cultivates the people's virtue of thrift and embodies savings in insurance, benefiting the national economy, people's livelihood, and material construction. How can we give up eating because of choking and not quickly plan to do it? Understanding this, the significance of our country's preparation for simple life insurance is more than half understood. Now, let us briefly describe the reasons for state operation and its process as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Why Simple Life Insurance Should Be Exclusively Operated by the State: The purpose of operating simple life insurance has been stated repeatedly, but the reasons why it should be exclusively operated by the state are briefly described below. First, the foundation is solid. Simple life insurance targets the majority of the public as the insured, and the premiums paid come from hard work and thrift. They must also be paid monthly. If the foundation of the insurance business is shaken, it will cause great pain in spirit and material. In particular, the members of companies and factories are mostly group contracts. If they encounter misfortune, the number of people is large and the appeal is strong. If private companies are allowed to operate, there will inevitably be profit competition. If unfortunately there is a shake-up, it will affect the people and cause great harm. Therefore, it should be classified as a state monopoly, with the accumulated funds preserved by the national treasury as a guarantee. With reliable protection, the foundation can be consolidated. Second, the purpose is non-profit. Simple life insurance is a social undertaking, and its purpose is based on non-profit. Due to the special nature of the business, the expenditure on operating expenses is also relatively large. At the same time, premiums must be kept low. Therefore, it is necessary to use the existing and widespread postal agencies and their personnel to handle this business. Only then can it be expected to reduce costs and use the accumulated funds to generate interest according to the direction of social policies, in order to improve the welfare of the people. This is especially beyond the operating direction and capabilities of private life insurance companies. Third, the business is popular. If the simple life insurance business is operated by private companies, due to the relationship between income and expenditure, they will inevitably focus on cities as the important operating areas. They will mostly ignore other cities, making it difficult to achieve popularity. However, with state monopoly, it can be planned and taken care of as a whole, making it popular throughout the country, so that people in remote areas have the opportunity to use it, so that the purpose of the business can be implemented and achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>(2) On the Formulation of the Simple Life Insurance Law: In the second year after its opening, in the autumn of the 10th year of the Republic of China, the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, considering the importance of simple life insurance to the national economy and people's livelihood, drafted the Simple Life Insurance Law, which was submitted to the Ministry of Transportation for review and forwarded to the Legislative Yuan for review. The process was interrupted due to the September 18th and January 28th incidents. When Mr. Zhu Jiahua took office as Minister of Transportation, he believed that the simple life insurance business made a great contribution to the country and society and should be prepared to increase national welfare. He submitted it to the Executive Yuan for transfer to the Legislative Yuan for continued review, and at the same time ordered the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau to quickly prepare and draft an implementation plan for submission to the Ministry for approval. Subsequently, the Legislative Yuan handed over the draft to the Legal and Economic Committees for review. After several reviews, it was passed by the 14th General Assembly this year (24th year). It was subsequently promulgated by the National Government on May 10 of the same year, and the Savings and Remittance Bureau was ordered to draft subsidiary regulations, which have also been submitted to the Ministry for approval.</p>
<p>(3) Dispatching Personnel to Japan to Investigate Simple Life Insurance Matters: The state-run simple life insurance business is most successful in Japan, as mentioned earlier. The social situation in our country is also relatively similar to that of Japan. Mr. Zuo, who specialized in human insurance in the United States in the past, has been responsible for preparing for simple life insurance matters since joining the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau. Fortunately, Minister Zhu Gongfeng was spared no effort and sent him to Japan last autumn to investigate all matters related to simple life insurance. After arriving in Japan, he went to the Simple Insurance Bureau (the general bureau handling the national simple insurance business), the Postal Savings Bureau (the Postal Savings Bureau), and its first, second, and third-class post offices and the Simple Life Insurance Central Health Examination Center to conduct detailed investigations. He not only sought details of internal handling procedures, but also explored them in detail, and discussed them with experts, lasting more than two months. He also collected more than 400 kinds of materials for our reference.</p>
<p>(4) Recent Preparations: The state-run simple life insurance is a great undertaking. To adapt to the needs of the people and promote business, the procedures are simplified externally, while the internal procedures are quite complicated. Sufficient preparations must be made before it can be expected to proceed smoothly. Therefore, the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau is currently making every effort to prepare for the initial launch in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hankou, and then gradually extend it to the whole country. However, the success of Japanese simple life insurance depends not only on the diligence and dedication of the staff, but also on the support of the community. Simple life insurance cannot be effective without collective efforts. It is hoped that people in our country will promote this emerging social insurance business. Sincerely, with incense and prayers.</p>
<p>7 Conclusion</p>
<p>Due to space limitations, the above description of the functions of simple life insurance and social insurance and their process is only a brief outline. However, the life insurance business is a necessary organization for social economy. The development of this business is linked to the progress of national civilization, and simple life insurance is a facility to realize social policies, benefit the national economy and people's livelihood, and relieve the economic losses suffered by the general public. The law is good and the intention is beautiful, and nothing surpasses it. Although the methods of various countries are different, their important principles are the same. Ordinary life insurance has been circulating in our country for decades. In terms of progress, it is very slow. There are few life insurance companies at present. It is worrying that it is not enough to handle ordinary life insurance, let alone simple life insurance. This is why the government authorities have prepared simple life insurance to meet the needs of the people. However, the main purpose of the business is not to compete with private life insurance companies. Because its insurance has certain restrictions, such as policyholders who want to enrich their economic protection because of better customs, they can re-apply to private life insurance companies for a larger amount of life insurance. Moreover, because simple Tao insurance has universal publicity to popularize insurance ideas, it can also increase the business of private life insurance companies. It is beneficial to private life insurance companies both directly and indirectly. Mingxin, July 15, 24th year, (End)</p>

<p>— Shoujuan</p>
<p>Mourning Mr. Zheng Zhengqiu</p>
<p>Oh, heavens! What kind of era has it been for these three years? Internal troubles, foreign aggression, natural disasters, and human disasters are all pressing down on this poor China, leaving it riddled with holes and in a terrible state. The loss of territory, the loss of economy, the loss of talent, and the loss of culture cannot all be listed in a table or cleared up with numbers. Oh, heavens! Is this due to the unkindness of heaven or the inadequacy of human plans?</p>
<p>In these three years, the successive deaths of relatives, elders, teachers, and friends have made me disheartened with the world after grief. But I did not expect that my old friend of twenty years, Mr. Zheng Zhengqiu, would also leave us. This is another very important item in the list of talent losses, which has left me dumbfounded for several days. Not only has the Mingxing Film Company lost a cornerstone, the film industry has lost a mentor, but China has also lost a fighting warrior in art and culture.</p>
<p>Recalling his contributions to the stage and screen over the past twenty years, how great they were. Every May, I could often see him appear on stage to speak out, performing "Hidden Pain" and "Old Man Huang's Dream," crying bitterly, wanting to awaken the Chinese people from their delusions. Who knew that times would change, the situation would deteriorate, and Zheng Zhengqiu, although the universe is vast, there is no place for you to cry bitterly now. Even if you don't die of illness, you will be suffocated alive! Therefore, while mourning Zhengqiu, I am also fortunate for Zhengqiu, because once it's over, what is there to miss in this world?</p>
<p>Zhengqiu, although you died quietly, your spirit is immortal, and your soul is immortal. When the autumn graves sing with ghosts, we can still see your "Hidden Pain" and hear your "Old Man Huang's Dream."</p>
<h3 id="e142">Pavilion <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Rongyu</p>
<p>Along a long official road, there is always a pavilion standing every ten or eight miles. Although it is dilapidated and there is no scenery to admire, it is still a great merit to give people traveling long distances a place to rest their feet and get some fresh air. Especially in the hot weather, people walking under the scorching sun, with no shade from trees on either side, with sweat beads hanging down like yellow beans, resting in that pavilion is as refreshing as eating ginseng fruit. Therefore, this pavilion is not just an ornament in the countryside, but a philanthropist who helps travelers.</p>
<p>The structure of the pavilions, although not uniform in size, is always like this: pointed top, surrounded by bird-wing-like corrugated tiles, with square, hexagonal, octagonal, and rectangular shapes. Short retaining walls are built around the perimeter, and you can see the scenery in all four directions while sitting inside. The long stone strips are the easy chairs for travelers. The rough stone surface has been smoothed and oiled by people sitting on it, showing how many people competing for fame and fortune pass by on this road every day, sitting on the stone sweating and panting. I think that if the stone strip had knowledge, it would be secretly laughing at the busy lives of people, wondering what they are for!</p>
<p>Those who rest in the pavilion are always peddlers, porters, and frustrated friends. Noble people have cars and boats and will never patronize here. People sit here without having to ask each other's names. If you like peace and quiet, sit alone for a while and run away. If you like to chat, you can chat with the people sitting next to you, talking nonsense to relieve boredom. Besides, you don't know when or if you will meet the people you meet again, so there is a feeling of "meeting by chance" and "why bother to know each other when we meet"!</p>
<p>"The pavilion is good, but it is not a place to linger for long." This is true: people come here, rest for a while and leave, and never stay for ten or eight days. However, there are also pavilions that are taken over by beggars, who set up shop in the corners of the pavilion, building ten stoves, blackening the walls with smoke. The stone benches are their beds, and the straw mats, bamboo poles, and broken baskets are spread all over the ground. When you encounter this situation, it makes travelers afraid to rest!</p>
<h3 id="e143">Tropical Sentiment <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— Yiqiu</p>
<p>Moonlit night, under dense coconut trees, on the soft green grass, young girls sit, leisurely playing with their moon lutes (or pipa). The beautiful sound and scenery attract many passing youths, who run to sit beside them. Embracing, singing, and soon, pairs of them go home. These girls have slightly brown skin, but they are delicate and beautiful. All young people find them lovely. This is the special sentiment of the Dutch East Indies island of Java.</p>
<p>The river water is not deep but very clear. Many women ride on the backs of giant elephants to cross the river. Some elephants even have small canopies on their backs to avoid the scorching sun. The strangest thing is that their full and beautiful breasts are on display for everyone to see, without being covered by clothes. It is said that they worship virgins, so they open their chests and bare their breasts to show that they are still virgins and are not afraid of being inspected. This is a custom near Siam.</p>
<p>These two tropical sentiments were told to me in a letter from Miss Pan Wenjuan, who is currently a popular entertainer in Nanyang. I found them interesting and I am passing them on to the readers of Spring and Autumn.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Random Musings on Bedbugs <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Drunkard Student</p>
<p>Recently, I read Mr. You Aimei's "Broken Clouds and Scattered Rain Records." It mentions a story about Baoying County: regardless of which shop it is, none of them are willing to exterminate bedbugs. Moreover, they avoid calling them bedbugs, instead calling them "money bugs," and so on. This reminded me of a friend, Mr. Huang, more than ten years ago. He was a big fellow who opened a very large shop in the northern part of the city. In the summer, the employees were disturbed by bedbugs and couldn't sleep well at night, so they wanted to find a way to exterminate them. However, this boss (Mr. Huang) remained calm and indifferent. He even defended the bedbugs, saying: these bedbugs are "wealth bugs," only wealthy families have them. Unlike the lice on poor people's bodies, which are hateful. Think about it, Shanghai has a large population and thriving commerce, so there are so many bedbugs. If there were no "wealth bugs," how could the market be so prosperous? People laughed so hard they couldn't stand up straight when they heard what he said. Now his shop has long since failed and closed down. As for the economic downturn, it has reached its extreme. I wonder what he thinks of wealth bugs now. Furthermore, Mr. Aimei said: Suzhou has a special custom. When a woman gets married, they always catch two bedbugs, wrap them in red paper, and stuff them in the cracks of the bed. Because bedbugs can give birth to nine offspring in one night, it is meant to be a good omen. I wonder if this is true? I have asked several friends from Suzhou, and they all say: there is absolutely no such thing.</p>
<p>In the special supplement of this newspaper on the 15th of last month, there was an article entitled "The Bedbug Extermination Movement": it said, "It is unknown whether there are bedbugs in foreign countries. But from the fact that the Japanese call bedbugs 'Nanjing bugs,' it seems that bedbugs are unique to China." etc. According to my understanding, bedbugs also exist in foreign countries. The "Morning Light" column of the "Morning Post" recently published "European Travel Diary." It said: "In a certain large hotel in Moscow, there are many bedbugs, and one cannot sleep peacefully all night." This shows that bedbugs are not unique to China. However, foreigners are good at concealing their shortcomings, unlike Chinese people who easily show their ugliness. Therefore, there are no elegant names such as "Moscow bugs."</p>
<h3 id="e145">Record of Drifting Fragrance of Royal Incense <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>This is truly a very serious and shocking report! Although I was standing behind a curtain behind the Empress Dowager's throne, unable to see her face, I clearly saw her back suddenly flinch. From this, I could surmise that Her Old Highness must have felt quite stimulated after hearing this report. I myself paid even more attention to this matter because the Guangdong Governor-General so accused was an old friend of my father's. Although I had not read the accusations against him carefully, I knew a few of them. It seemed that this person had been too autocratic in Guangdong and had neglected the suffering and public opinion of the people he was supposed to govern, to the point that the people resented him bitterly. They privately organized and came to Beijing to file official complaints, this being the fourteenth or fifteenth time, including this last one. The charges against him were very specific, and I still vaguely remember a few:</p>
<p>First charge: Embezzling public funds;</p>
<p>Second charge: Forcibly robbing wealthy merchants in Guangzhou and extorting money;</p>
<p>Third charge: Openly feasting in restaurants and eateries in the market, unbecoming of an official;</p>
<p>Fourth charge: Using violence to force virtuous women from good families in the province to become concubines;</p>
<p>Fifth charge: On one occasion, while patrolling outside the city, an elderly beggar did not avoid the procession and suddenly crossed its path, causing the Governor-General to</p>
<p>Indulge his servants in brutally beating the beggar with whips, who died on the spot;</p>
<p>Sixth charge: Privately hoarding gifts presented to the Empress Dowager from various regions. (371)</p>

<p>He calmly replied with a smile: This matter is easy to resolve. As the saying goes, "Hold this office, perform this rite." If I were to become the director of a department one day, and the New Life Movement were still enthusiastic, I would certainly not smoke. Even if Director Gao gave me a job now, I would definitely promote old morality and talk about benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness. Zhiqian smiled and said: What about taking a concubine? Zhiqian found this somewhat difficult. He raised his hand and scratched his head twice, saying: This is a bit of a conflict between new and old ideas. According to old morality, even sages had concubines, so it is not a bad thing. However, new morality speaks of monogamy. It's hard for me to say. I am a modern person, but I advocate promoting old morality. So, it's difficult for me to say. As he spoke, he kept scratching his head. It could be seen that although his wording was difficult, he was still quite appropriate. Zhiqian said: Opinions naturally differ from person to person. As he spoke, he smiled faintly. It seemed that there was some criticism within that smile, but Jiafu did not pay any attention to it. He held a cigarette in his mouth at an angle, sitting and blowing smoke straight out. After a long time, he smiled slightly and said: Mr. Cheng is much more familiar with the situation in Xi'an than I am. I wonder if he has any talent in his pocket who can serve as a orderly? If so, he could introduce one to me. Zhiqian originally did not want to talk to him, but when he mentioned wanting to hire a errand-runner, he suddenly thought of something. Wasn't the old tile mason entrusting him to find a job for his nephew? This would be a win-win situation, and he could introduce him. So he replied: Speaking of this, I do have someone I can introduce. Does Mr. Zhang need him urgently? (271)</p>
<p>Personal Vignettes</p>
<h3 id="e147">Mourning Fragments of Autumn <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Jiren</p>
<p>Regarding the passing of my leader, Mr. Zheng Zhengqiu, various newspapers have already tirelessly reported on his virtuous conduct and great virtue. Now that the coffin is sealed, it is concluded that Mr. Zhengqiu was a "good old man". If destiny indeed held sway over lifespan, then it's as if Heaven is jealous of good people?</p>
<p>I stepped into the film industry in 1927. Since the position I held was very humble, Mr. Zhengqiu, with the respect of an Assistant Manager, uniquely promoted and took care of me, even encouraging me earnestly. It appeared that he had high hopes for me, but alas, I am ashamed to say that, "all my peers who were students were not cheap (successful)". Haven’t I remained the same as before? Thinking about it now, I have failed Mr. Zhengqiu's kindness. I myself have not made much progress.</p>
<p>Two years ago, at the passing of my teacher, Mr. Wang Meiqu, I wrote a long eulogy. It is pitiful to say that soon after mourning a guiding teacher who had given much instruction, Mr. Zhengqiu, who was considered a lifelong confidant, passed away after a sudden illness of four or five days. Years of mourning mothers and teachers, one after another, I was born at an unfortunate time, my fate is ill-fated, and it is both shocking and heartbreaking to talk about it.</p>
<p>Over these years, Mr. Zhengqiu often entrusted me with literary matters, so I often went to his residence to serve him. I benefited greatly from discussing principles and doctrines with him, and he also told me much about his history.</p>
<p>... "During the peak period of the 'Minli Daily' in the late Qing Dynasty, because I liked to write articles from a young age, I submitted them to various newspapers. Suddenly, one day, Mr. Yu Youren called me in for a conversation and entrusted me with the responsibility of editing the local edition of the Minli Daily. From then on, I embarked on the path of journalism. Later, I wrote theater reviews for 'Lili Place,' which gained the trust of a wide readership. The management then invited me to compile a special drama section, and thus I embarked on the theater ladder because of my interest in amateur opera. From reviewing dramas to performing in them, and then from performing in Peking Opera to crossing into the world of spoken drama, I felt that the power of spoken drama was more universal than Peking Opera, able to penetrate people's hearts, so it could be used to promote culture, advocate revolution, and achieve far-reaching results. Therefore, even though I spent a large part of my family fortune to save spoken drama from extinction, I actually 'destroyed my family to alleviate the national crisis' and revitalize the drama. During Yuan Shikai's reign, I was arrested in Hankou for performing revolutionary dramas. I have always adhered to the principles of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, but it is unbelievable that I have never joined the party to this day. After performing in spoken dramas for several years, younger generations who followed my style were willing to become my students, numbering over a thousand. As cinema flourished, I gave up my life as a performer and dedicated myself to the positions of screenwriter and director." ...</p>
<p>It can be seen that Mr. Zhengqiu's moral character and writings were highly respected. As for Mr. Zhengqiu's writing, although it cannot be confined to rules and regulations, with a kind of overflowing talent and a clever mind, not to mention that no one can compare with him, even experienced teachers and scholars would sigh in inferiority and dare not compete with him. Mr. Zhengqiu's thoughts were indeed unique. In terms of qualifications, he would shame gilded PhDs, but he never even went to any school. His clear mind is something that people cannot match.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhengqiu liked the art of raising goldfish. When he had time, he would often go to see the dozen or so tanks of goldfish raised by Little Qiu. For years, he had been eager for a grandson. In the New Year, he happily welcomed a grandson, and he enjoyed the joy of being with grandchildren. His mother was still alive, and Mr. Zhengqiu was very filial to her. Four generations lived together in harmony and happiness.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhengqiu's health was originally weak, and this summer he seemed to be doing well. However, he had suffered from insomnia for a long time. Last month, many fish-raising comrades established a "Chinese Art Fish Society," and Mr. Zhengqiu was also one of the founders. On the evening of the 10th, a comrades' dinner was held at Guanshengyuan. Mr. Zhengqiu, along with Wen Lang and Little Qiu, happily attended. After the meal, he and Mr. Zhu Dake and I discussed the matter of re-establishing a fish garden, and we wanted to restore the "fish enjoyment" proposal. Mr. Zhengqiu took the sole responsibility for raising a large amount of money to promote this group. Who would have known that upon returning home, he would have incessant diarrhea, followed by vomiting? On the 12th, Mr. Chen Youchen and I went to Suzhou. The next evening, Mr. Zhengqiu even entrusted us with purchasing two items from Suzhou, "Songzi Yunpian Cake" and "Fresh Lotus Seeds." How could I have known that when I arrived in Shanghai by train on the 14th, the news of Guang-sheng's death had already been brought by the tea servant! Hearing this shocking news, where could I find the "soul-returning incense"?</p>
<p>At Mr. Zhengqiu's funeral, the mourners numbered no less than three thousand people, and the general movie-loving audience must also remember the great contributions he left behind!</p>
<p>In the midst of grief, I present a couplet as a farewell, which reads:</p>
<p>Little grass is deeply cultivated, looking at each other as friends who have forgotten age.</p>
<p>Swimming fish are startled to lose water, who will privately mourn and lend a helping hand?</p>
<p>I felt it was appropriate and had it written out and sent. A lifetime of knowing each other and being appreciated, once forever separated, alas, alas. How sad.</p>

<p>(London, 20th - Reuters) Today's Davis Cup Interzonal Final between the USA and Germany, held at Wimbledon, was disrupted by rain during the second singles match between Allison and Kramm, leading to unprecedented chaos. Thousands of spectators, dissatisfied with the decision, threw cushions at the linesmen on the court and smashed beer bottles, causing a disturbance that lasted for ten minutes until police intervened.

<p>Budge Defeats Henkel in First Singles Match: Young American player Budge defeated Germany's Henkel three to one in the first singles match. Budge only showed his speed and ability from the Wimbledon semi-finals in the fourth set, completing it in just twelve minutes. Both players appeared flustered. Although Budge had some good performances, his strokes lacked precision and depth. Henkel, playing from the baseline, countered with deep cross-court shots, sometimes scoring points due to Budge's mistakes. However, he was conservative when forced. The two players' groundstrokes and serves were similar, and their backhands were equally matched. However, Budge's net play and speed were better.</p>

<p>First Inspect the Situation and Then Take Office</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Beiping) The issue of the president of Qingqi University in Shandong has not been resolved for a long time. After the board of directors recommended Liu Shichuan as president, Liu was modest for many months. Now he has finally agreed. Today (July 22nd) at 3:05 PM, he will take the Pinghu through train from Beiping to Jinan. Before leaving, he made the following statement to reporters: "I have been recommended by the board of directors of Qingqi University to be the president. Because I have been away from my alma mater for eighteen years, I am gradually unfamiliar with the situation there. However, due to the repeated invitations from the board of directors and the urging from alumni everywhere, I have no choice but to first go to Jinan to inspect the situation of the school. If my personal ability is sufficient, I will naturally be willing to serve my alma mater. However, my personal talent is limited, and if I cannot cope, there is nothing I can do."</p>

<h3 id="e160">Berlin Chinese Art Exhibition Hosts Banquet for Liu Haisu <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of the Berlin Chinese Art Exhibition believes that representative Liu Haisu's trip to Europe to promote art has been highly respected by various countries and fields, and has had an unprecedentedly great and profound impact on the European academic community. His outstanding work has brought him great honor on his return to the East. All exhibits have been checked and returned to the Preparatory Office for distribution. All proceeds from the sold works will be periodically returned to Mr. Liu by the Preparatory Office through accountant Pan Xulun. All reports are ready. Yesterday, the Preparatory Committee held a banquet for Representative Liu on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel and asked him to report on the exhibition. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees</p>
<p>Cai Yuanpei, Li Shihui, Ye Gongchuo, Wu Tiecheng, Li Dachao, Wang Zhen, Huang Binhong, Qian Xinzhi, Pan Gongbi, Pan Xulun, Liu Haisu, Huang Binhong, Zhang Daqian, Wang Jiyuan, Wu Hufan, Xie Gongzhan, Zhang Ze, Wu Dongmai, Wang Geyi, Zheng Wuchang, Xu Zhengzi, Yan Kechang, Ma Chonggan, Xu Ze, Li Zikuan, Qian Cangshuo and dozens of others.</p>
<p>Cai Yuanpei Reports</p>
<p>The banquet started at 7:00 PM. Chairman Cai Yuanpei reported that Mr. Liu Haisu, representing our country to hold a Chinese modern art exhibition in Germany, has gained supreme glory and great success. After the exhibition in Berlin, it has attracted the attention of various countries. He has toured more than ten places in Europe, shaking the whole of Europe and making Europeans understand that our country's art is still constantly advancing, changing Europeans' previous misunderstandings. He has promoted art to various countries in other aspects, positioning himself as a representative of Oriental art. Our country did not pay attention to it before. After this art exhibition, the focus of Europeans has shifted. This is solid evidence of the strength of our national artists and the honor they have won. Thanks to Mr. Haisu's efforts and struggles, and without fear of hardship, there is this result. Such achievements and great spirit really make us admire and thank him. Our country has had many misfortunes in recent years, and we have not had time to pay attention to foreign cultural promotion, and we feel economic difficulties. After the Executive Yuan decided on this art exhibition, it also decided to allocate 45,000 yuan. The whole thing was accomplished by Mr. Ye YuFu's hard work. At the same time, Mr. Ye presided over all the affairs of the association in China without fear of hard work. We should express our gratitude to Mr. Ye. However, the funds allocated by the Executive Yuan are only for the Berlin exhibition in Germany. After the opening of the Berlin exhibition, all provinces in Germany and other countries warmly welcomed and requested continued exhibitions. Although the funds were allocated and subsidized by local governments or art academies, Mr. Liu's personal expenses for returning to Sichuan were all paid for by the proceeds from his sales and private loans. It seems that the government has achieved great success with a small amount of funds, which is really beyond our expectations. However, Mr. Liu's personal burden is too heavy, and we cannot fail to find a way to rescue him. Now that Mr. Liu has returned with honor, he has published a notice asking all the writers to take back all the unsold works from the Preparatory Office, and he has entrusted accountant Pan to return all the sold paintings. He is worthy of praise for his careful planning. Please raise your glasses to show our respect to Mr. Liu.</p>
<p>Liu Haisu Reports</p>
<p>Chairman Cai asked me to report on the European art exhibition. I have prepared a written outline of the general situation, which is recorded here. The success of my trip to Europe to exhibit paintings is due to the support of Mr. Cai, Mr. Ye, and all the members of the preparatory committee. At the same time, I have also received the assistance of my colleagues in the art world, who have contributed their transcendent and great works of art. As a result, Haisu is only serving the country, society, and all his comrades. On November 13, 1933, I hurried to Europe on the Italian ship Contifanter. On the evening of December 8, I arrived in Berlin. The German committee members Kou Meier, Kong Wei, and Laiteman, and the secretary Tan Zhuangfu and Zhang Jing in the Chinese Embassy in Germany, welcomed us and said that the German side had held several committee meetings and had urged China to come because the opening date was approaching. At that time, Mr. Kou made an appointment to hold a joint meeting of the executive committees of China and Germany at the Oriental Art Museum on the 13th. On the morning of the 13th, I attended the meeting with Mr. Zhang Zengji. The German committee members who attended were Klinboer, Kou Meier, Lin Chi, Kong Wei, and Laiteman, 11 people in total. Klinboer was the chairman. The chairman first gave a welcome speech and reported the opening date. It had been decided to open on January 13 and close on March 4. I thought the time was too short, and the various procedures and printed materials were not prepared in time. After repeated discussions, it was decided to open on January 20 and close on March 4. At that time, we opened the boxes together and checked the works. Everyone was very satisfied. However, the catalog was too simple. After a brief discussion, it was decided to rewrite it, and each painting should be marked with paper or silk core, the content of the poem, the year of production, and the author's address for viewers to study. Mr. Liu was also asked to write a long preface detailing the characteristics of Chinese books and the origin of various schools, which would be published at the beginning of the catalog. Starting on the 14th, he went to the Oriental Art Museum to work every day. At 5:00 PM on February 5, another joint meeting of the executive committees of China and Germany was held. The German side was attended by Shaer Wuklinboer, Amisdao Qukou Meier and more than ten other people. Shaer Wu, the president of the Oriental Art Society, chaired the meeting and decided on the following matters: (1) Please ask the Prussian Academy of Fine Arts to be responsible for sending letters to diplomatic corps, government offices, local governments, academic institutions and celebrities and reporters. (2) Invite reporters from various countries to visit on the 19th. (3) Opening day program. (4) 100,000 roadside advertisements, tram advertisements and subway advertisements, radio broadcasts, and train advertisements in Germany. At the same time, we will print a book of modern Chinese paintings, with an article on Chinese painting schools, and prepare to distribute it to German institutions and scholars at the meeting. After Haisu arrived in Germany, many reporters from various newspapers visited every day. Each newspaper published my talks and news about the art exhibition. The German government and the public paid great attention to this matter. At 10:00 AM on January 20, the Chinese Painting Exhibition officially opened at the Prussian Academy of Fine Arts on Paris Square in Berlin. The number of people attending that day was unprecedented for previous art exhibitions in various countries. The Germans called it the most magnificent spectacle of the modern European art scene. It is estimated that more than 3,500 people attended that day, including ambassadors from various countries, representatives from local governments, celebrities, scholars, and nobles. During the 45 days of the exhibition, there were 4,500 visitors every day. All German newspapers praised the exhibition, saying that the Chinese modern paintings were vivid and full of charm, and that they were a transcendent ideal world that could not be reached by all countries. The sensation was not only praised by the German government and the public, but also attracted the attention of European countries. Hamburg, Minxing, the Rhine provinces, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, France, Italy, Britain, and Poland all sent letters and telegrams one after another, inviting them to exhibit, and some sent people to Berlin to discuss with Su. The great impact and shock on Europeans can be imagined. Haisu asked the domestic government for instructions and was successively allowed. He then went to various places for touring exhibitions. However, all the expenses, including the Berlin exhibition, were allocated 35,000 marks by the Executive Yuan. According to the budget of the Preparatory Office, it was used up in Berlin. The exhibition expenses in other countries and regions were allocated and subsidized by local art academies or municipal governments. As for the two-year period, Haisu's personal travel expenses, in addition to the paintings, were all borrowed privately, and he is still heavily in debt. Although the country is in trouble, he has no complaints because of his volunteerism. Because Su has been thinking about promoting our country's art and science for more than 20 years, it is like shouting blindly in a dark room, but now he can see the light suddenly. He should use all his strength to complete his mission, so that our country's culture can shine among the stars, so that Europeans can change their prejudice that Qin has no one. He has completed his mission with one breath, so he does not care about hardships and dangers. As a result, he has been warmly welcomed wherever he has gone. This glorious deed still shines on the European continent and can be a great page in our country's cultural history. Until the day Haisu returned, the United States, Turkey, Austria, and Poland still sent telegrams of welcome. Su will send ten of his own works and a part of his friends' masterpieces to Mr. Jiang Chongya, a lecturer at the School of Oriental Studies at the University of London in England. In two years, he has held large-scale exhibitions in various countries up to 15 times, with hundreds of thousands of visitors, and has sold more than 100 works. The Berlin Academy of Fine Arts in Germany has also specially opened a Chinese modern painting hall to permanently display modern masterpieces of our country for scholars to study. This is also a pioneering work.</p>
<p>Huang Boqiao and Others Speak</p>
<p>Then Huang Boqiao, director of the two railways, spoke, briefly stating that he had a few major thoughts on the Berlin Chinese Painting Exhibition. Boqiao was ordered to go to Europe to inspect the road administration. Most of the countries he passed through were the places where Mr. Haisu exhibited his paintings. After I met Haisu in Paris last October, we went our separate ways. However, wherever I went, local government officials, scholars, celebrities, or diplomatic corps praised the success of the Chinese Painting Exhibition and gave Europeans a very deep and widespread impression of Haisu. I have been to Germany, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, France, and Britain, and they all praised him. Then Pan Gongbi, Li Dachao, Xie Gongzhan and others spoke.</p>

<h3 id="e169">Introducing Zhenjiang Rural Nurse School <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Yin Jinquan</p>
<p>Since ancient times, our country has been known as an agricultural nation, with farmers accounting for more than 85 percent of the population. Therefore, rural revitalization is an urgent matter for governance. Currently, in the slogans of most people, the bankruptcy of rural areas is often a concern. However, to solve this problem, it is necessary to first understand what the reasons are. These reasons are indeed too complex. From a health perspective, the lack of widespread rural health services is a major cause of rural bankruptcy. Therefore, we should actively build up health services. Now, to operate rural health services, many trained and hardworking individuals are needed. However, in our country, where health services are in their infancy, there is a real shortage of health personnel. Therefore, to save rural health services, it is necessary to cultivate a group of health personnel who grew up in rural areas (rural nurses) to be effective. In today's rural areas, plagued by poverty and disease and lacking scientific physicians, the establishment of such rural nurse schools is necessary for the improvement of health services and the future of new medicine. I will now briefly describe the general situation of Zhenjiang Rural Nurse School for the reference of those in our country who are concerned about rural health services:</p>
<p>In the autumn of the year before last, gentlemen such as Leng Yuqiu and Zhang Yiyun, due to the need to spread health services to rural areas and the fact that rural areas could not afford doctors, established the Rural Nurse School in the environment of a shortage of rural doctors. It was established within the Zhenjiang Hongren Hospital. After graduation, they were sent to areas lacking health knowledge, unable to afford doctors, to treat diseases, promote health education, and guide public health work to provide relief. Therefore, it was named the Rural Nurse School.</p>
<p>Because the school was being piloted, enrollment was limited to Zhenjiang County. The district chiefs of each district selected two outstanding individuals who grew up in the countryside, who were admitted to the school after passing the examination. They were afraid of recruiting a group of young masters who could not be used after training, so the most important thing in the recruitment examination was to have a spirit of hard work and endurance. Because those who grew up in the countryside know the situation and suffering of the countryside, they will be willing to work enthusiastically in the future.</p>
<p>The training method for rural nurses is: (1) Moral Education: The goal of moral education in the school is "diligence" and "thrift". Students are always asked to do what they should do, and they are always asked to save money wherever they can. They try their best to avoid urbanization so that they can serve the countryside after graduation. (2) Education: The teaching method of the school is to practice immediately after learning so that they can understand step by step. In the first academic year, they supplement general science, followed by half a year of study and half a year of practice so that they can apply what they have learned after graduation. The subjects taught are anatomy, physiology, bacteriology, dietetics, bandaging, nursing ethics, public health, general nursing, internal medicine nursing, surgical nursing, ophthalmology nursing, urology and obstetrics and gynecology nursing, dermatology nursing, pediatric nursing, psychiatric nursing, family nursing, Party doctrine, Chinese, mathematics, chemistry, physics, botany, zoology, foreign languages, etc. The books used for each subject are determined separately according to the needs of the actual situation.</p>
<p>The above is an overview of the school. If we think about it carefully, in this situation where health is in its infancy, scientific physicians are lacking and unwilling to go to the countryside, and farmers cannot find doctors to treat them, this kind of talent can really treat diseases and reduce the suffering of farmers. At the same time, it can popularize health education and make people believe in scientific medicine as a pioneer. I think rural nurses are very suitable for meeting the needs of rural health services.</p>

<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(61) Neurogenic Intestinal Disorder and Mucous Colic</p>
<p>(Q) What is called neurogenic intestinal disorder?</p>
<p>(A) This is a disease in which there are no substantial changes in the intestinal tract, but intestinal symptoms such as colic or diarrhea occur for no reason. There are distinctions between sensory, motor, and secretory intestinal neuroses.</p>
<p>(Q) What is sensory intestinal neurosis like?</p>
<p>(A) Sensory intestinal neurosis is mostly a complication of intestinal spasms.</p>
<p>(Q) What phenomena occur?</p>
<p>(A) Patients suddenly develop hernias, which are often seen in lead poisoning. There are also attacks of colic, which are common in arteriosclerosis. There are also intestinal episodic pains, which are often encountered in spinal tuberculosis (syphilis).</p>
<p>(Q) What is motor intestinal neurosis like?</p>
<p>(A) In motor intestinal neurosis, the patient has intestinal peristaltic anxiety, especially in the non-intestinal part, which is found in neurotic individuals. There are also certain constipation, spasmodic intestinal obstruction, neurogenic diarrhea, and reflex diarrhea. This is seen in women or men with prostate disease. There are mental diarrheas and anal sphincter spasms. This is seen in anal fissures or hemorrhoids.</p>
<p>(Q) What is secretory intestinal neurosis like?</p>
<p>(A) Secretory intestinal neurosis is mucous colic, also known as membranous colic.</p>
<p>(Q) In what kind of constitution does mucous colic occur?</p>
<p>(A) Mucous colic mainly occurs in middle-aged neurotic individuals; it is more common in women.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the symptoms of mucous colic?</p>
<p>(A) When mucous colic occurs, mucus is excreted along with the stool. Some of this mucus is mixed with the stool, and some is excreted alone without colic. After the mucus is excreted, the colic disappears. It will definitely occur again after a few days or weeks.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the shape of this excreted mucus?</p>
<p>(A) The shape of this mucus is not fixed; the texture is transparent, mostly like a film. It often resembles a cast of the large intestine.</p>
<p>(Q) How long does this disease last?</p>
<p>(A) Very slow; the disease progresses and regresses, and treatment is very difficult.</p>
<p>(Q) Is there any danger to the life of a patient with mucous colic?</p>
<p>(A) There is no danger to life.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the treatment for neurogenic intestinal disorders?</p>
<p>(A) Usually, it is to rest, apply warm compresses to the abdomen, and take tonic and astringent medications internally.</p>
<p>(Q) What medicine should be taken when mucous colic occurs?</p>
<p>(A) Internally take belladonna extract, atropine, and other anesthetics.</p>
<p>(Q) How should the patient be treated when not experiencing an attack?</p>
<p>(A) Give food with less residue to prevent constipation. Do not use laxatives, only use oil enemas.</p>
<p>(Q) What other methods are there?</p>
<p>(A) Internally take sedatives such as bromine preparations and iodine preparations. Massage, galvanic therapy, and hydrotherapy can also be used. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e171">Foxglove Leaves and Heart Disease <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Dan Qi</p>
<p>Medical Story Five</p>
<p>Today, the medical community generally recognizes that foxglove leaves are a specific medicine for treating heart disease. How it came to be used as a medicine is an interesting and instructive story. In a beautiful booklet published in 1785, we find an early historical record of this story. The author of this booklet, named William Withering, was a medical doctor in Birmingham, England, with a natural perseverance and a sound mind.</p>
<p>In this booklet (titled: An Account of the Foxglove and Some of its Medicinal Uses: with Practical Remarks on Dropsy and Other Diseases), Withering detailed the origin of the use of foxglove leaves as a medicine. Foxglove is a summer herbaceous plant that grows in the cold and humid climates and soils of the solid parts. Withering had previously heard that an old woman in Shropshire could cure dropsy with a decoction of herbal tea. He really thought this was just an unreliable rumor that only the gullible would believe. Later, he personally saw a patient with dropsy, after all the doctors were helpless, cured by the old woman with a secret herbal tea, which aroused his determination to explore and experiment.</p>
<p>The story goes like this. The head of Brasenose College, Oxford, suffered from dropsy and consulted many doctors. They could not alleviate his symptoms, so his anxious family suggested asking the old woman from Shropshire to treat his illness. In a helpless situation, he drank a few bowls of the herbal tea given to him by the old woman. Sure enough, his dropsy completely subsided.</p>
<p>This is the visible fact that made Withering determined to explore. His first step was to obtain the prescription for the herbal tea. This was certainly not easy. The old woman made a living from this and would not reveal her secret. But Withering used all means - it is said that he bought it with heavy money - and finally got the prescription.</p>
<p>He found that the prescription contained a variety of herbs; based on his knowledge of medicine, he determined that the most important one was foxglove. He also tested whether the stem, leaves, or flowers of foxglove were more effective than its roots. The method of testing was, of course, to have patients take them separately. Based on the results of the experiment, he determined that foxglove leaves were the most effective part for treating dropsy. He continued to determine the distribution of the medicine and the steps for taking it. He said that when the patient's pulse became even and slow, or when the patient developed chest discomfort and nausea, the medicine could be stopped.</p>
<p>Let us distinguish the difference between Withering's knowledge and the knowledge of the old woman from Shropshire. Withering's contribution represents the second step in the progress of any medicinal knowledge. The old woman only knew that herbal tea made in a certain way was beneficial to the disease. She strictly adhered to a certain prescription passed down from her ancestors, without variation or experimentation. Withering did it this way. He found which herb was the most important in the prescription, which part of this herb was the most effective, what was the most appropriate amount of medicine to take, and what was the most appropriate step to take the medicine. In other words, he rationalized the use of this medicine. But his knowledge was still incomplete, he was not clear about the nature of the disease. He would never have thought that this medicine would act on the heart. He did not know the precise anatomy of the heart - at that time no one knew. This is not surprising because the complex microscopes applicable at that time had not yet been invented. Therefore, the theory that animal tissues are composed of cells, and that each cell has a certain chemical reaction, had not yet been conceived. The pharmacology of foxglove had to go through more than a hundred years of progress in medical knowledge to be fully understood.</p>
<p>So, what is the real situation of foxglove treating heart disease? The heartbeat is a contractile wave that begins at the top of the heart—the auricle—and moves down to the bottom—the ventricle. The track through which the wave passes is a small bundle of muscle and nerve tissue—called the "Bundle of His." When heart disease occurs, the auricle vibrates. The vibration of the auricle passes through the "Bundle of His" so quickly that the ventricles that are prepared to be driven out respond very irregularly and inflexibly. As a result, the amount of blood actually flowing is greatly reduced, and the blood accumulates in the blood vessels, which is the cause of dropsy. Foxglove leaves contain a chemical component. When the Bundle of His absorbs this chemical component, a chemical reaction occurs, which results in it not being affected by the vibration of the auricle, indirectly protecting the ventricles, making the pulse average again, and the blood moving again. Since the accumulated blood is circulating, the edema naturally subsides.</p>

<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(56) Ozena (Continued)</p>
<p>(2) Formation of Crusts: Crusts often form in the nasal cavity of patients with this disease. These crusts are formed by the drying of purulent secretions. When we use a rhinoscope to examine the nasal cavity, we see that the nasal cavity is abnormally wide. Its walls are covered with dirty gray-white or greenish purulent crusts. The surface of the purulent crust is very dry and has a foul odor. If the purulent crust is removed, the atrophic and thin mucous membrane can be seen.</p>
<p>(3) Atrophy of the Nasal Mucosa: The mucosa of the nasal cavity is mostly atrophic and thin, and appears pale white, firmly attached to the bone, and not easily separated. The most obvious part of the atrophy is the inferior turbinate. At this time, if an anterior rhinoscopy is performed, it is easy to see the posterior wall of the nasopharynx from the front. This is because the mucosa of the turbinate has atrophied and thinned, and the nasal cavity is abnormally wide.</p>
<p>In addition, what can be noted in this disease is that the external shape of the nose is mostly flat. Patients often feel nasal congestion, loss of smell, headache, heavy head, indigestion, dry throat, listlessness, and lack of pleasure, etc.</p>
<p>Complications of this disease include dry pharyngitis, chronic catarrh, and suppurative otitis media. Sometimes it can be complicated by suppuration of the paranasal sinuses. Sometimes the inflammation can spread to the eye socket through the lacrimal duct.</p>
<p>Speaking of the treatment of ozena, the most important thing is (1) to find a way to eliminate the formation of crusts. (2) To make the foul odor of the secretions disappear. (3) To hope to cure the atrophy of the nasal mucosa and bone. But in fact, this is very difficult. (4) To explore the cause of this disease and treat it. (5) To enhance the nutrition of the whole body. (6) To treat the various symptoms that come with it. Therefore, its treatment can be divided into local treatment, causal treatment, and systemic treatment. Local treatments include nasal irrigation, Cott's cotton swab method, nasal mucosa vibration massage, quince solution application, medicinal powder insufflation, electrical analysis, congestion therapy, and submucosal paraffin injection, etc. Causal treatment must be performed after the pathogen has been identified. "Vaccine" therapy has recently been reported to be effective and can be tried. As for the most effective systemic treatment, it is the internal administration or injection of cod liver oil or vitamin preparations.</p>

<p>A. Urethra: The female urethra is shallower, shorter, and straighter than the male urethra. Its structure is also simpler. However, on the posterior margin of the external urethral opening, there are usually two small tubes, the so-called Skene's glands. These small tubes are easily infected with early gonorrhea.</p>
<p>B. Vagina: Since the vagina is the place of intercourse, its clinical significance is more important than other parts. The vagina is an expandable tube, rich in folds. Its upper end embraces the cervix, and its lower end opens into the vulva, that is, the vaginal opening. On the left and right sides of the vaginal opening are the bulbs of the vestibule. This corresponds to the male corpus spongiosum. Around the vaginal opening are countless mucous glands, called the lesser vestibular glands. At the posterior end of the vestibular bulbs is the greater vestibular gland, that is, the Bartholin's gland.</p>
<p>The vagina is located behind the bladder and urethra, and in front of the rectum. It receives the vaginal part of the uterus and begins at the vaginal fornix. The anterior vaginal wall is tightly attached to the urethral wall, and their tissues are mutually fused. The posterior vaginal wall is closely attached to the anterior wall of the rectum. This is very different from the male urethra, because in men, the relationship between the urethra and the rectum does not present a fused state.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 General Course and Symptoms of Gonorrhea</p>
<p>Section 1 General Course of Gonorrhea</p>
<p>A. Progression of Gonorrhea</p>
<p>The course of gonorrhea can be divided into acute and chronic. Generally, two or three days after infection, the disease is limited to the superficial external urethral opening and its vicinity. At this time, the invasion of gonorrhea is only on the surface of the mucous membrane. After about two weeks, the disease progresses and reaches its peak. At this time, the lesion invades the deep part of the mucous membrane, and the number of gonorrhea is much more than in the initial stage. The course of acute gonococcal anterior urethritis - if treated immediately, the course is good, and the symptoms gradually disappear at the end of three or four weeks. However, commonly two or three weeks after the occurrence of anterior urethritis, it spreads to the posterior urethra, especially due to excessive movement, sexual intercourse, erection, spermatorrhea, the use of irritating foods, or the use of urethral probes, catheters, and careless injection of drugs by patients, which induces acute gonococcal posterior urethritis.</p>
<p>After the acute gonorrhea has passed, if the patient does not pay attention to health care, stops treatment, or the treatment is not appropriate, the bacteria will not be eliminated and the secretions will not be reduced. It will further invade the submucosa and related glands and nearby organs. At this time, the effect of drugs is very difficult. Therefore, in the long course, it may occur or stop. Especially due to labor, drinking, sexual intercourse, and other unhealthy habits, there may be recurring acute symptoms. As for invading the glands and nearby organs, causing paraurethritis, periurethral infiltration, Cowper's glanditis, prostatitis, seminal vesiculitis, epididymitis, cystitis, pyelitis, etc., there are too many to list. In women, due to anatomical and physiological relationships, there are more occurrences of Skene's glanditis and Bartholin's glanditis, and proctitis.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is said that gonorrhea can also be transferred to distant places through blood or lymph, causing gonococcal inflammation. The most common is the joints, followed by the tendon sheath. Other possible transfers include the endocardium, bones, muscles, nerves, middle ear, peritoneum, pleura, and pericardium.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Medical Treatment for Pain Relief (24) <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Li Xing</p>
<p>Cancer Pain</p>
<p>In European and American countries with advanced science, due to the widespread use of scientific medicine and the improvement of public health administration, the general mortality rate has been significantly reduced. For example, tuberculosis, which accounts for the highest mortality rate, has dropped to a low ranking. Cholera, the most terrible of acute infectious diseases, is now almost extinct. The author has never seen or heard of a case of cholera in more than seven years of traveling in the United States. Furthermore, typhoid fever, which has a very high mortality rate, has now been reduced by more than 95%. The rest, such as direct infectious diseases and infant mortality, have also been reduced to a very low level. The greatness of the efficacy of scientific medicine is really amazing, and its benefits to the people cannot be considered small.</p>
<p>The age of the people is inversely proportional to the mortality rate, that is, a high mortality rate means a low life expectancy for the people, and a low mortality rate means a high life expectancy for the people. In the most developed European and American countries with scientific medicine, the average life expectancy of the people has reached more than 50 years, which is more than twice the average life expectancy of the people in our country. As a result of the increase in the age of the people, there is also a kind of mortality rate that is rapidly increasing, which is terrible, and scientific medicine has almost lost its effectiveness. What is this disease? It is cancer (various cancers and malignant tumors). Various cancers are directly proportional to the age of the people, that is, the more elderly people there are, the more people who develop cancer, so cancer is the great enemy of the elderly. How can it be said that scientific medicine has almost lost its use for this frequent disease? Its meaning is that various cancers can cause the death of the patient. Except for the early stages of cancer, which can be saved, scientific medicine is completely powerless to save the rest, which are slightly later. Therefore, once a person suffers from cancer and enters a more serious state, it is equivalent to a death sentence, and doctors all over the world are completely helpless. At present, countries around the world spend large sums of money every year to study methods to save late-stage cancers, but no significant results have been seen. As for whether it will be completely successful in the future, no one can say. The causes of cancer are still not very clear and must continue to be studied.</p>
<p>Cancers are divided into two major categories. The first category, which accounts for the largest part, is carcinoma, and the smaller part is sarcoma. The most common parts of the body to develop cancer are: stomach, women's breasts, uterus, cervix, ovaries, male and female large intestine, rectum, face, etc. The methods of treating cancer now are: early-stage cancers can be cut off, or treated with radium, or electrocauterized, or irradiated with X-rays, and there is assurance that they can be cured. There is no assurance that more severe cancers can be treated with the above methods. Late-stage cancers cannot be saved because they can spread to other parts of the body. The danger of cancer is due to its metastatic nature.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Brief Discussion on Pulmonary Tuberculosis (60) <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Section 6 Renal Tuberculosis</p>
<p>The prognosis of this disease is very difficult to predict decisively; but it is not absolutely bad, as previously expected. There is also no way to deal with the ulcerated state. Sometimes, due to artificial pneumothorax surgery, the reduction of cough and sputum, and throat diseases, a turning point towards recovery may occur. As for the pulmonary tuberculosis itself, how far has it progressed? The general state of the patient, etc., are closely related to the prognosis of this disease.</p>
<p>In addition to laryngeal tuberculosis, nasal tuberculosis can also be seen from time to time; however, it is far less numerous than the former! Since its symptoms are not very many, and there is no special treatment that can be proposed, it will not be discussed here.</p>
<p>Renal tuberculosis is a type of local tuberculosis, a venereal disease. It mostly occurs after pulmonary tuberculosis. The origin of its formation is due to the spread from the vascular system. This situation has already been described in Chapter 4 above! In the kidney, it initially develops caseous lesions, which are mostly limited to a part of the kidney. If this caseous lesion collapses, it can also form a cavity state, just like the situation in the lungs. In addition, it is possible for connective tissue to develop around the lesion, resulting in a healed state, and calcareous sclerosis. Sometimes, it even causes complete obstruction of the urethra.</p>

<h3 id="e176">An Analysis of Chinese Disasters and Famines <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>I. A Few Heartbreaking Words Before the Discussion</p>
<p>The bankruptcy of the agricultural economy has become widespread in China, and no province can escape this whirlpool. In some places, increased grain harvests and small consumer markets have led to the phenomenon of "cheap grain hurting farmers." In other places, crop failures have led to soaring grain prices, resulting in unprecedented grain shortages. In still other places, there have been no harvests for several years, and tens of millions of farmers live a life of displacement, teetering between life and death. Therefore, the collapse of China's agricultural economy is a fact, whether in the "wealthiest in the world" Zhejiang and Guangdong, or in Shanxi and Gansu, where "bumper years do not provide warmth and sustenance." It has probably reached the end of its rope.</p>
<p>It must be understood that the causes of these phenomena, which have led to the bankruptcy of China's rural areas, can be traced back to the following three points:</p>
<p>(1) The insatiable, cruel exploitation and oppression of international imperialism;</p>
<p>(2) The various forms of exploitation and harm by domestic feudal forces;</p>
<p>(3) The serious threat and destruction of natural disasters.</p>
<p>The first two points will not be discussed for the time being. In this year of loudly proclaiming "reviving the countryside" and "relieving the countryside," news of natural disasters, one of the fatal wounds mentioned above, is also pouring in from various provinces and counties. Flooding from the Yangtze River has already begun to attack Shashi, Hankou, and the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The recent few days of sunny weather have slightly eased its threat. However, there are already talks of a flood like the one in the twentieth year of the Republic of China [1931]. As for the provinces of North China, such as Hebei, Shandong, and Shanxi, they will still not escape flooding this year. The Yellow River has once again breached its banks, and the water from the breach is said to be threatening to divert its course and seize the Huai River. The provinces of Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi have all suffered considerable flood damage. It can be said that last year was a year of great drought, and this year is a year of great floods. With such recurring droughts and floods, it is easy to understand how China's agricultural economy is accelerating its bankruptcy.</p>
<p>The above is considered the introduction to this article.</p>
<p>II. Let's Look at the "Land of Famine"</p>
<p>Speaking of China's disasters and famines, it has a very long history.</p>
<p>Originally, someone said that China is a "Land of Famine." According to the "Tongzhi" and "Xu Tongzhi," from the year of Duke Huan of Lu in the Spring and Autumn period to the fourteenth year of Chongzhen at the end of the Ming Dynasty, just considering floods and droughts alone, there were more than 1,323 incidents. And the occurrences happening several times in a year were not calculated. In addition, disasters such as locust plagues, windstorms, hailstorms, insect plagues, earthquakes, and various other disasters were not included. If they were included, the number would be even more staggering. In the 264 years of the Qing Dynasty, there were disasters and famines every year: from the third year of Shunzhi (1644) to the third year of Xuantong (1911), an average of about 60 counties were affected each year, accounting for 3.73% of the counties in the eighteen provinces of the country (according to the eighteen provinces, there are a total of 1,607 counties). According to the book "China, Land of Famine" by Walter Mallory, he created a table based on the scope of each famine. This table is based on historical materials written by Chinese people. According to his statistics, from 620 BC to 1900 AD, there were a total of 1,506 disasters in China that encompassed entire provinces. Therefore, China can be called a "Land of Famine."</p>
<p>There are records upon records in history, which we will not elaborate on. Let's just talk about the facts of recent years. However, in recent years – now when China's economy is totally bankrupt – isn't every year a struggle under the disasters and famines? If we talk about the types of disasters and famines, there are floods, droughts, rice borers, locusts, wild beasts, field mice, frost, hail, earthquakes, landslides, plagues, and large fires. If we talk about the scope of disasters and famines, they span more than twenty-five provinces. If we talk about the severity of the disasters and famines, the most severe was the drought in the Northwest from the 17th to the 20th years of the Republic of China [1928-1931], where the land was barren for over a thousand miles, with tens of thousands dying. Starving corpses littered the roads, and villages were empty. The floods in sixteen provinces in the 20th year of the Republic of China [1931], in the area of the Yangtze and Huai rivers, many people, livestock, and houses were submerged, and much land was washed away, causing the local vitality to be difficult to recover even after a long period of time. According to the investigation and summary of the disaster situation by the Relief Committee from the 17th to the 20th years of the Republic of China [1928-1931]: In the 17th year of the Republic of China [1928], 203 counties across the country were affected, compared to 1,936 counties in the country, accounting for 10.4%. In the 18th year of the Republic of China [1929], the number of affected counties suddenly increased to 841. In the 20th year of the Republic of China [1931], there were 519 affected counties. The 21st year of the Republic of China [1932] can be said to be a year with lighter disasters, but there were floods in provinces such as Jilin, Heilongjiang, Shanxi, and Yunnan, years of water, drought, wind, and hail disasters in Shaanxi, and breaches in the rivers of Hebei, and water followed by drought in Jiangxi. As many as seven provinces suffered from disasters and famines. Among them, the four provinces of Jilin, Heilongjiang, Shanxi, and Shaanxi were more severely affected. According to the survey report of the South Manchuria Railway Company, 80% of the cultivated land in Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces was completely submerged by floods, and the loss of agricultural products accounted for more than 70% of the total annual harvest. Sixty-eight counties in Shanxi suffered from floods, and more than ninety counties in Shaanxi suffered from ice, hail, and wind disasters, but statistics on the losses are lacking. As for the disasters and famines in the 22nd year of the Republic of China [1933], although the extent of the disaster area and the severity of the disaster were not as severe as the great flood in the 20th year of the Republic of China [1931], the locust plague alone was a very serious disaster. According to the report of the Shen Bao Yearbook: the disasters and famines in the 22nd year of the Republic of China [1933] shook the country. In Henan, Shandong, Hebei, and Jiangsu, there were more than 53 counties affected by the Yellow River flood. Other disasters include floods in Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hebei, and Guizhou (excluding the Yellow River flood); banditry in Hunan, Henan, Shaanxi, Hubei, Gansu, Jiangxi, Fujian, Sichuan, and Qinghai; windstorms in Henan, Shaanxi, Anhui, and Guizhou; hailstorms in Henan, Shaanxi, Anhui, Guizhou, and Jiangsu; frost damage in Henan and Shaanxi; and other disasters such as earthquakes and rat plagues also affected various provinces in Shaanxi and Gansu. The locust plague in the 22nd year of the Republic of China [1933] covered as many as ten provinces, and if calculated by county, there were as many as 231 counties. In total, in the 22nd year of the Republic of China [1933], 476 counties across the country were affected by various disasters. In a nutshell, the entire China is under the threat of disasters and famines. If we add the various exploitative relationships of imperialism and feudal forces, it will further increase the persecution of peasants by natural forces. If we do not obliterate the facts, we will certainly see tens of millions of farmers and women, as well as their sick and elderly parents and young children, struggling on the line of death with miserable wails, desperate cries, howls, and hungry cries! The past was like this, the present is like this, can the future not be like this?</p>
<p>III. A Glimpse of the Disasters and Famines of Last Year</p>
<p>The previous disasters and famines were like this, let's look at the most recent year! The 23rd year of the Republic of China [1934]! Regarding the statistics on drought, according to the recent agricultural information reports of the Central Agricultural Experiment Station of the Ministry of Industry (Issues 9-11 of the second year), the disaster-stricken provinces and fields can be extracted as follows: (Unit: 1,000 acres)</p>
<p>Table 1: Statistics of Drought in Various Provinces of China in the 23rd Year of the Republic of China [1934]</p>
<p>Province Name Original Acreage Affected Acreage Percentage</p>
<p>Jiangsu 91,583 49,455 54</p>
<p>Zhejiang 41,113 21,790 53</p>
<p>Anhui 53,662 37,027 69</p>
<p>Shandong 201,505 38,572 38</p>
<p>Henan 104,578 38,694 37</p>
<p>Hunan 42,245 22,389 53</p>
<p>Hubei 56,223 17,991 32</p>
<p>Jiangxi 38,135 18,305 48</p>
<p>Hebei 95,603 57,362 60</p>
<p>Shanxi 56,627 14,603 26</p>
<p>Shaanxi 30,722 13,825 45</p>
<p>Total 72,993 330,013 46</p>
<p>As for the floods, they were also very serious last year. According to the disaster reports of the Relief Committee in the 23rd year of the Republic of China [1934], the following table can be extracted: (Unit: 1,000 acres)</p>
<p>Table 2: Statistics of Floods in Various Provinces of China in the 23rd Year of the Republic of China [1934]</p>
<p>Province Name Number of Affected Counties Original Acreage Affected Acreage Percentage</p>
<p>Hubei 3 61,010 5,266 9</p>
<p>Hunan 30 45,612 1,390 3</p>
<p>Henan 28 24,754 8,375 7</p>
<p>Hebei 31 103,432 5,747 6</p>
<p>Shanxi 29 60,560 1,283 2</p>
<p>Shaanxi 30 33,496 1,491 5</p>
<p>Sichuan 37 96,272 345 0.4</p>
<p>Anhui 2 35,520 886 2</p>
<p>Jiangxi 18 41,630 2,304 6</p>
<p>Suiyuan 13 20,964 4,828 24</p>
<p>Fujian 19 23,581 1,534 7</p>
<p>Chahar 8 17,243 128 1</p>
<p>Total 266 627,065 33,406 5</p>
<p>Note: Shandong (10 counties) and Guizhou (12 counties) are not included because there is no data for cultivated land.</p>
<p>From the above table, it can be seen that there were only twelve provinces affected by floods in the 23rd year of the Republic of China [1934]. In fact, there should be more than this. For example, there are no detailed statistics on the Yellow River flood in Shandong Province. These are all incomplete. However, from these incomplete statistical reports, we can know that the total area of ​​farmland affected by droughts and floods in the 23rd year of the Republic of China [1934] was more than 36,341,900 acres! It must be understood that the increase in affected farmland means an increase in wasteland, which also means a loss of crops.</p>
<p>IV. A Picture of Disaster Victims</p>
<p>In short, these facts are all reflections of the bankruptcy of the rural economy. If we do not obliterate these facts, we should witness all kinds of facts such as "starving captives filling the roads" and "people eating each other in hunger, more than half of whom die"!</p>
<p>Here, we can introduce a picture of tens of millions of people in miserable desperate cries, howls, and starvation. According to the Relief Committee's investigation of fourteen provinces including Henan, Jiangsu, and Guangdong, the total number of disaster victims displaced by natural and man-made disasters reached as many as 65,665,170 people. This alarming number illustrates the hidden worries in China's social structure. The statistical table is as follows:</p>
<p>Table 3: Estimated Number of Displaced Disaster Victims in Various Regions Recently</p>
<p>Province Number of Disaster Victims</p>
<p>Hebei 4,161,000</p>
<p>Henan 13,116,115</p>
<p>Hunan 6,400,000</p>
<p>Hubei 9,000,000</p>
<p>Jiangxi 6,000,000</p>
<p>Jiangsu 6,552,000</p>
<p>Zhejiang 3,000,000</p>
<p>Anhui 6,674 (Note)</p>
<p>Shaanxi 5,584,526</p>
<p>Gansu 4,750,000</p>
<p>Shanxi 2,103,013</p>
<p>Shandong 4,106,013</p>
<p>Sichuan 2,598,806</p>
<p>Guangdong 329,946</p>
<p>Note: Only reports from Anqing and Wuhu counties, others not included.</p>
<p>According to the above statistics, the total number of disaster victims is more than 65 million, not only from natural disasters but also from man-made disasters. If the above total is added to the number of disaster victims in recent years, there are at least 100 million disaster victims in China. It must be understood that these 100 million people who have left the countryside due to natural and man-made disasters, plus the various exploitative relationships of imperialism and feudal forces, then how many farmers are suffering from this persecution?</p>
<p>However, these phenomena clearly show that the collapse of China's rural economy is undoubtedly certain. In this situation, farmers who are wandering on the line of life and death are naturally prone to taking "risks," such as robbing rice and eating from the rich. This is their method of struggle. This method of struggle is naturally the "most primitive method," but what else can they do? According to the statistics compiled by the Zhongque Economic Intelligence Agency (China Economic Intelligence, Volumes 2, Issues 23), last year (the 23rd year of the Republic of China [1934]), the trend of robbing rice and eating from the rich had spread to seven provinces and twenty-eight counties, with a total of sixty-four incidents. The statistical table is as follows:</p>
<p>Table 4: Statistics of Farmers Robbing Rice and Eating from the Rich in Various Places in the 23rd Year of the Republic of China [1934]</p>
<p>County New Times</p>
<p>Sichuan 5 5</p>
<p>Anhui 4 4</p>
<p>Jiangsu 11 19</p>
<p>Zhejiang 13 28</p>
<p>Number of Counties Times</p>
<p>Guangdong 2 2</p>
<p>Shaanxi 1 3</p>
<p>Henan 2 3</p>
<p>Total 38 64</p>
<p>In this situation, how can we talk about "disaster relief"? In short, the problem of disasters and famines in China is not just a problem of disasters and famines, but still a problem of China! Even if the problem of disasters and famines is solved, the problem of China cannot be solved. The past facts are already in the past, and this picture of displaced people still exists. If this persecution of natural forces is intensified this year, such as the simultaneous arrival of floods in the Yangtze River and the Yellow River, even if it does not bury these tens of millions of disaster victims in the bellies of fish, it will add a thick color to this picture of displaced people!</p>
<h3 id="e177">A Simple Explanation of Traditional Bookkeeping <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Hongjing</p>
<p>I. Introduction</p>
<p>Bookkeeping is the recording of the inflow and outflow of goods or money, clarifying assets, liabilities, and thoroughly calculating profits and losses. Therefore, regardless of whether the style is new or old, and no matter the difference between Chinese and Western methods, simplicity and clarity are paramount. Only clarity can minimize errors and prevent fraud; only simplicity can facilitate verification and save labor. This matter seems easy at first glance, but it is actually difficult to master. Beginners, if they do not have a solid foundation in arithmetic and abacus, will not be able to fully understand it. If they only know the superficial aspects—merely imitating without understanding the underlying principles—they will be controlled by the bookkeeping system instead of controlling it. Consequently, there are cases where businesses suffer losses, so caution is necessary.</p>
<p>II. Categories</p>
<p>Western bookkeeping is divided into single-entry and double-entry systems. Traditional bookkeeping does not have specific names. For the sake of easy narration and clarity, the simplest and clearest traditional method is temporarily named the "Dragon Gate Four-Column Method." "Dragon Gate" refers to the four items in a daily cash flow statement: original balance, total receipts, total disbursements, and actual balance. The actual balance should correspond exactly to the cash on hand. (If there are rounding errors, they should be recorded separately.) "Four-Column" refers to the four items used to clarify profits and losses by categorizing assets and liabilities into: old accounts, new receipts, disposals, and actual assets. "Old accounts" include capital and liabilities. "New receipts" include profits and income. "Disposals" include losses, daily expenses, and miscellaneous items. "Actual assets" include debts owed to the business, cash on hand, inventory, and advances. To ensure thorough auditing and clarity and to prevent financial difficulties, the "old accounts" and "actual assets" should be further categorized. The "old accounts" can be divided into "external debts" and "internal debts." "Internal debts" include capital, public bonds for business protection, or temporary or fixed deposits from eastern and western business partners. "External debts" include temporary transactions or fixed-term loans. "Actual assets" are also divided into "internal debts" and "external debts." "Internal debts" include expenses from eastern and western business partners, inventory, and advances. "External debts" include debts owed by customers, temporary or fixed-term loans. In essence, although "old accounts" and "actual assets" are divided into several categories, the urgency of payments and collections, the likelihood of bad debts, all vary depending on the situation, the individual, and must be flexibly handled by the individual. For the sake of clarity, a table is provided below:</p>
<p>The division of deposits into four columns corresponds well with the Western-style balance sheet and profit and loss statement. A comparative table of Chinese and Western account settlements is proposed below:</p>
<p>III. System</p>
<p>(A) Main System: The source of bookkeeping is the "cash flow." Cash flow can be divided into several types: cash flow, goods flow, futures flow, and transfer flow. During busy times, goods flow can be further divided based on wholesale and retail, such as "wholesale goods flow," "retail goods flow," or "retail sales flow," "wholesale goods flow." Cash flow can vary depending on the currency type, such as in Dalian, where merchants may have "banknote flow," "silver note flow," and "small silver coin flow." Relationships arising from cash flow are called "transactions." All debit and credit relationships are recorded in "transaction accounts," which can be further divided into "bank transaction accounts," "customer transaction accounts," and "loan transaction accounts." In short, the complexity of the matter, the number of different account books, and the names all vary depending on the situation, the location, and customs, and cannot be uniform. "Old accounts" are used to record the business's trading goods. Broadly speaking, they can be divided into "spot goods old accounts," "futures goods old accounts," "retail old accounts," "manufacturing old accounts," and "exchange old accounts." The names also vary depending on the location and customs, and are not consistent. "Miscellaneous accounts" record the business's expenditures, daily expenses, public expenses, rent, etc., and are commonly referred to as "expense accounts."</p>
<p>(B) Auxiliary System: Includes documents retained for reference, communication records, entertainment records, employee directories, and guarantee registers. The specific titles depend on the complexity of the matter and the number of accounts. In short, ensure that nothing is omitted due to complexity and that unnecessary non-productive staff are not hired for the sake of detail. This is the key.</p>
<p>IV. Usage</p>
<p>(A) Transcription: All receipts and payments, inflows and outflows of goods, are first recorded in the cash flow. Then, the transcription clerk classifies and transcribes them into the transaction accounts or old accounts. After each transcription, the supervising clerk places a dot on the upper right shoulder of the item's name in the cash flow. In the cash flow, the words "receipt" and "payment" are used to indicate the action. In the transaction accounts or old accounts, the words "coming" and "going" are used, with the month and day written above. The month does not need to be repeated in the same month, and the word "again" is used for the same day. However, if on separate pages, the month and day should be written again for clarity. Busy businesses often transcribe transaction accounts first based on documents and mark the documents with a sign. The cash flow clerk then makes entries based on the documents, and the supervising clerk adds the dot. Small quantities are annotated in detail to the right of the currency name.</p>
<p>(B) Reconciliation: Reconciliation is performed by someone who is not a bookkeeper, such as a bright apprentice, to provide the bookkeeper with rest, to provide a fresh perspective that can easily spot errors, to prevent fraud, and to provide the apprentice with an opportunity to learn accounting. Sometimes, the chief accountant—also known as the general ledger desk or executive—performs this task to show seriousness and prevent fraud. The method uses two stamps: "transcribed" and "reconciled." The person holding the cash flow holds the "transcribed" stamp and calls out, and the person holding the transaction account or old account holds the "reconciled" stamp and acknowledges. After matching, the "transcribed" stamp is placed on the "receipt" or "payment" entry, and the "reconciled" stamp is placed on the month and day of the "coming" or "going" entry.</p>
<p>(C) Account Roots: "Account root" in Shanghai dialect, also called "account file," means setting up a separate account for each transaction partner. For external transactions, account roots are set up by port, categorizing similar transactions together for easier inspection. For example, if there are both out-of-town and local transactions, local transactions should be categorized into Chinese and foreign businesses, with foreign businesses and Chinese businesses listed together in close proximity. For out-of-town transactions from Qingdao, Yantai, and Tianjin, the merchants from each port should be grouped together in close proximity for ease of inspection. Furthermore, if the same business has both fixed deposits and overdraft transactions, separate account roots should be established based on the nature of the transactions. Another example is when a customer commissions many shipments of goods, and the miscellaneous expenses are all recorded in the transaction account, which becomes cumbersome and unclear. A separate account should be set up for each customer, with a separate root for each transaction. After the transaction is completed, it is transferred to the transaction account, making it easier to calculate expenses and making the transaction account clearer. Conversely, large-scale sales of goods within the business should also have separate roots, and the principle is the same as described above. If retail sales within the business are recorded in a single root, it will be messy and unclear, making it impossible to determine profits and losses. Setting up separate roots for each item would be too tedious due to the large variety of goods. The best way is to categorize by type, not by category. For example, different brands of flour such as "Red Sun Dangtian" and "Yuan Bingchuan" can be combined into one root, while different brands of coarse cloth such as "Shepherd Boy" and "Great Wall" can also be combined into one root. For clarity, the best way is to number each transaction. When selling, indicate the purchase number on the month and day of the sale, and next to the purchase number, note how many pieces of a particular number have been sold. When the goods are sold out, the notes should match the purchase quantity.</p>
<p>(D) Closing Accounts: (1) For cash flow accounts: Cash flow is divided into four items: original balance, total receipts, total disbursements, and actual balance. The actual balance must match the cash on hand. If there is an error, such as a missing entry, it should be added. If there is an incorrect entry, it should be matched with the corresponding debit and credit entries before the account can be changed. Remember, remember. Only after the actual balance matches the cash on hand should the account be closed. The date of the next day is then written after it to prevent omissions. (2) For transaction accounts or old accounts, except for immediate cash transactions, which are reconciled and balanced by the end of each month by totaling the debit and credit amounts and writing the total under the month and day, all other accounts with balances, whether debit or credit, should be settled before clearing. The last balance should be listed in the debit or credit balance. In old accounts, the common practice is to use money as the debit and credit, and the goods are attached. Therefore, when closing the account, in addition to indicating the monetary balance, the quantity of goods in stock should also be noted to match the actual inventory. It is best to indicate the average price of the remaining goods. If the payment and the goods are recorded separately, they should be settled and accounted for separately.</p>
<p>(E) Documents: (1) Purchase orders and loan agreements vary depending on the location and customs. There should be written rules to follow. The key is to be clear and unambiguous. (2) Documents related to cash flow and transaction accounts include invoices, transaction statements, cost sheets, and interest statements. In addition to detailed annotations in cash flow and transaction accounts or old accounts, annotations on documents should be concise.</p>
<p>(F) Auditing: The word "auditing" is difficult to describe. For example, large and small errors should be divided by nine, and debit and credit errors should be divided by two.</p>
<p>V. Conclusion</p>
<p>(A) Hiring Bookkeepers: Bookkeepers are entrusted with the responsibility of accurately recording assets, liabilities, and thoroughly calculating profits and losses. Therefore, the selection and training of bookkeepers must be prudent. A quiet and honest person may be easy to direct, but a dull person will not be able to offer advice or contribute. A lively and intelligent person, with spare energy and the ability to contribute, may not be content with a mechanical life. Therefore, they may be suppressed or promoted. It depends on the person in charge to weigh the options. Cultivating talent within the business is not an easy task. However, constantly hiring dull or elderly people with no ambitions as bookkeepers, without rotation, stifles their intelligence, weakens their bodies, and, except for the benefit of obedience, their lack of assistance and contribution can result in losses that outweigh the gains. Moreover, what about those who are not benevolent? When first learning business, it is best to work as a bookkeeper for a short time to understand the business's overall situation. Afterwards, they should be assigned to other positions to learn various aspects, so that when they take on important positions, they will not be limited to social skills and unfamiliar with accounting, resulting in inaccurate calculations. This would be ideal.</p>
<p>(B) Supervising Bookkeepers: As the saying goes, "Use people without suspicion, and if you suspect them, don't use them." This is true. However, even if you use people without suspicion, supervision is essential. Reviewing accounts, counting cash, and checking securities and contracts should be done regularly. Do not use trickery or intelligence against employees. In short, being weak is not acceptable, but arrogance is useless. One must win them over with kindness and restrain them with authority. Even difficult individuals will then comply.</p>
<p>(C) The Qualities a Bookkeeper Should Possess: As mentioned above, bookkeepers have heavy responsibilities and important missions. Therefore, the qualities that a bookkeeper should possess are also essential. In their spare time, they should read books and newspapers to increase their knowledge, communicate with field staff to understand market conditions, exercise to reduce weight, and laugh to aid digestion. They should not be content with fulfilling their duties but should learn and ask questions to have opportunities for promotion. In short, for the sake of career advancement, being a bookkeeper can be temporary, but not permanent. When working, they should not complain about the heavy workload and little credit. When supervising bookkeepers, they should be considerate. The capacity for tolerance varies from person to person, but one should strive to be magnanimous. Furthermore, how to maintain integrity to gain the trust of others, how to be loyal when under the command of others, how to be open and fair when commanding subordinates are all things that cannot be fully described in writing. One must cultivate these qualities in ordinary times to be able to handle situations with ease. The world's customs are no longer what they used to be, and the way of friendship is declining. In both the north and south, the number of people who can work together in harmony and cooperate to build a business is decreasing, leading to the increasing formation of family businesses, which is not a good sign. In family businesses, parents and siblings often spoil their children and fail to discipline them properly. Children also become lazy and unmotivated because they rely on their families. This is not as good as the strict supervision and intensive work of non-family businesses, where there are fewer opportunities for fraud. Therefore, when studying business, one should stay away from parents and siblings to develop themselves. When running a business, one should use more outside talent to avoid bias in rewards and punishments based on personal feelings, and to utilize talent from all regions. However, what is being discussed here is already beyond the scope of bookkeeping.</p>

<p>Only Opened at 1.8%...Subsidiary Coins Still Stable</p>
<p>The silver dollar market has seen easing conditions since the front two trading days, and with yesterday being Sunday, a bank holiday, demand was even more sluggish. As a result, the interbank lending rate, which had not changed for several days, fell by two points. Both the morning and afternoon sessions opened at 1.8%. Interbank lending transactions totaled over 2.3 million in the morning and over 300,000 in new transactions. There were no transactions in the afternoon session. Transactions in the small general clearinghouse totaled over 400,000. Banknote transactions involved over 400,000 in marked notes. Silver collateral transactions involved over 200,000 in redemptions.

There were no other transactions. As for the market for subsidiary coins, the results were stable. Jiangnan small silver coins rose three yuan in the morning, opening at 838 yuan, but returned to 835 yuan in the afternoon, so the final result was the same as the previous day. Transactions totaled 5,000 dimes in the morning and 4,000 dimes in the afternoon. Guangdong small silver coins were 4 small cents higher in the morning, at 736 yuan and 5 cents.

<h3 id="e179">Securities: Settlement Approaching, Volatility in Bond Market Last Week <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>In the past week (July 15th to 20th), the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange also switched to two trading sessions due to the hot weather, with the afternoon session temporarily suspended until the weather cools down. As the settlement period approached, the market experienced increased tension in the management of margin calls, and volatility ensued. Initially, rumors in the environment sparked a downward trend. Fortunately, vigorous purchases by the long position number 48 turned the market from weak to firm. On Wednesday and Thursday, rumors of bailout loans sparked a surge in the market, with strong momentum and the potential for further gains. However, due to sluggish financial conditions and a lack of fresh capital, the market ultimately failed to sustain its gains, and the weekend saw a return to a gloomy atmosphere. The current trend indicates that there are only a few trading days left in the current month, and the outstanding balance remains high at over 30 million yuan. It is rumored that the short positions are very strong, and most of the arbitrage trades from last month failed to roll over due to monetary conditions, which had a significant impact on the market. Based on market conditions, there is a strong inclination for a short squeeze. The 96 Public Bonds are increasingly favorable under the control of long position number 4 and with large-scale covering by number 48. The market price has broken through the 10 yuan mark and has the potential for further gains. Overall, the market prices at the end of last month rose by about 3 to 5 cents to 1 yuan compared to the previous weekend. The total transaction volume was 88.3 million and 8,000 yuan. The high and low results for the week are listed in the comparative table below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>Yesterday, US cotton opened lower due to poor news from Liverpool, with widespread selling. Spot traders sold short distant months, and concerns about cotton harvest management and the Senate's slight changes to the Cotton Industry Reorganization Amendment, as well as the Texas court's injunction against the collection of the ginning tax set by Pankhaise, all unsettled the market. Local companies and other industry players bought in slightly during the price declines, but the effect was minimal. As a result, spot cotton fell by 10 points, and futures fell by 11 to 19 points. English cotton spot fell 9 points, and futures fell 8 to 10 points. Indian cotton initially weakened due to long position liquidations but recovered later due to short covering and slight purchases by European exporters. Bengal fell by 1 to 1.25 rupees, Oomra fell by 2.5 to 3.75 rupees, and White Western fell by 1.75 to 3.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded to the left (July 20th telegram):</p>

<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, the sources from various rivers numbered eight or nine. The boats of river rice have become sparse. The market supply has decreased, and the price of white rice opened tight, nearly one cent. Later, the supply became more active and the surrounding rural areas continued to trade, causing the market price to rise by about two cents. Thin rice arrived in small quantities and was sold quickly, and the price also rose. White Yuan retail prices were stable due to the large amount of inventory.

<h3 id="e183">Review of "Nora's" Acting <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— You Na</p>
<p>Having just left the hospital and unable to walk, two residents supported me and dragged me to the Jincheng Grand Theater. There, some friends dragged and pulled me up to the fourth-floor dressing room, where the leading actors all shook hands with me.</p>
<p>This time, I came specifically to see their acting, especially to appreciate Lan Ping, who had left a deep impression on me. After seeing it, I wanted to write some thoughts, but I was too sick to hold a pen. Until a few days ago, I was still leaning on crutches, limping and hobbling to the Carlton to see "Hero and Beauty." I was very satisfied and wanted to express some opinions, but my illness prevented me. Gradually, I saw various positive reviews of these two performances in the newspapers, which made me unable to resist saying a few words.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou Da, in the Da Mei Evening News, commented on "Nora" and said: "…Especially each actor can accurately express the personality of the characters in the play… The acting level of this performance is catching up with the highest level of international acting art." I feel that Mr. Zhou's criticism is a bit too general; he takes the highest level of international acting art too casually.</p>
<p>With a popular actress playing Ibsen's famous "Nora," and the director doing his best to make the performance a success, it is true that the overall stage arrangement of this "Nora" performance was good, and the performance techniques were quite successful. Among the recent public performances, it can be considered the most successful. But to compare it to the highest level of international acting art is far too much. As for whether it has reached the highest level of domestic drama, I think it is hard to say.</p>
<p>Wasn't the last performance of "Roar, China!" at the Golden Grand Theater last year, the performance of the first two acts of "Storm on the Yangtze River" and "Nora After She Left" by Mailun Middle School, and the performance of the first two acts of "Song of Rejuvenation" and "Under the Mercury Lamp" this year, not very vivid and moving? Can the acting in this performance of "Nora" really surpass the above performances? Even "The Paint is Not Dry," performed by Jida not long ago, could the consideration of personality and the overall compactness be inferior to this performance of "Nora"?</p>
<p>"Nora" is indeed very difficult to play, and there are many shortcomings in this performance. Starting with Ms. Lan Ping, who plays Nora—Lan Ping played in "The Locked Box" last year. Her flexible performance, powerful movements, and especially her sharp and expressive eyes, I think she is the female actress in China who is currently the best at facial expressions.</p>
<p>This time, she played Nora, and from a forceful point of view, it was indeed good. However, she has two major shortcomings. We cannot ignore them just because she is generally good. Precisely because we hope that she will have a deep understanding of acting techniques, we must point out her shortcomings.</p>
<p>The first shortcoming is that her performance of joy and liveliness is very unnatural, forced, and contrived. The contrivance is too trivial, mediocre, and lacks generosity, which makes people feel unhappy. It is not the expression of Nora's childlike, lively, and lovable personality.</p>
<p>The second shortcoming is that her power is too monotonous. There is no change in the high and low levels. When she scolds Krogstad, she is so fierce and powerful. When she discovers that Helmer only loves her as a toy, her performance when she leaves is still the same power as before. Her power stops at the same level. Afterwards, she cannot increase her power and perform it with profound, resolute, and unyielding feeling. This is Ms. Lan Ping's failure. When Nora's borrowing money is discovered by her husband, and Helmer scolds her as a confused woman, how shocked, frightened, and indignant should Nora be? However, Lan Ping did not raise her energy and did not do it properly. When Nora says when she leaves, "I am a person. I want to educate myself. I want to fulfill my responsibilities to myself!" How much power should these words be said with, and the expression should be extremely serious and calm, to show her claim to maintain her independent personality, but Ms. Lan did not perform with any special enthusiasm here, only a consistent flat force, which is not enough. Also, when she says, "Millions of women in the world have sacrificed their reputations for men!" These words should be said with a resentful and indignant tone and expression, and the stage atmosphere at this time should be handled very seriously, but Ms. Lan did not deeply experience it. Furthermore, such as: "I don't believe in laws that don't care about women's interests. I want to see if I am wrong or if the whole world is wrong? - The whole world is wrong! Religion and law are things that protect special interests!" This climax of the top point should be performed with a complete rebellious spirit, seriously and resolutely, to what extent did Lan Ping grasp it here, and did she satisfy the audience very much? I hope that the audience who loves Ms. Lan's art should point out unceremoniously that she performed too weakly in this passage, and her expression was not enough.</p>
<p>In short, Ms. Lan's acting this time is much more powerful than that of ordinary actresses, and she also flexibly handled the position on the stage. It is only a pity that her liveliness is too unnatural, and her arrogance is fierce, sometimes close to frivolous, lacking composure and rhythmic movements; especially her power, from beginning to end, is a flat tone, like a piano without the highest and lowest octaves, unable to play tunes with high and low variations. But she is a promising actress, I hope she works hard!</p>
<p>Zhao Dan's role as Helmer is simply not in line with the personality, and his failure was expected. He is too young and his figure is too small. It is best to play a young man with vigor and firmness. He plays Helmer, a middle-aged gentleman. At the very least, he doesn't have the demeanor of a gentleman, he can't put on the airs of a husband, and he doesn't look like a hypocrite who is deeply involved in accidents. When Helmer discovers his wife's concealment, he is so angry that he reveals his hypocritical mask himself, and nakedly throws out his selfish face, scolding Nora viciously and violently for the sake of his own reputation. This is the key to the transformation of the whole play. How should he understand the plot and make that hateful and abominable appearance? Although Zhao Dan worked very hard here, he didn't seem hateful. When the creditor returned the IOU, Helmer wanted to bring his wife back into his palm to play with. Although Zhao Dan did a good job here, it was like arguing with a little lover and then trying to apologize, not describing the psychology of Helmer, a gentleman and a hypocrite.</p>
<p>Ms. Wu Mei, who plays Mrs. Linton, was so dull and lifeless in the first act, not at all like a woman struggling in hardship, and even less could one see that she was a woman with commercial knowledge. Her shriveled and pitiful appearance simply did not resemble the character in the play. The last two acts were quite in line with the status of a widow, but they were still too dull.</p>
<p>Mr. Wei Heling's Dr. Nan Kai is too hunchbacked and too old and decadent. His unrequited and pitiful psychology can be said to be very well expressed, but he was not very successful, because he did not achieve that timid and laughable state. This is a difficult and thankless role, difficult to play and difficult to succeed. Ms. Wu Ling, who plays the maid, has an air that is too noble. Only Jin Shan played to excellent success.</p>
<p>These words may be seeking flaws in jade, but speaking of acting art with a serious attitude, I feel that I have to say it this way.</p>

<p>— Lin Ni</p>
<p>There is such a person, he has existed in the world, but it seems that he will never exist, until the people who remember him also die. He has no political views, he doesn't know Newton, he doesn't know Edison, but he knows the names of grasses better than me, which grass can cure which disease, and he knows the changes in the weather better. He knows how much grain this field produces, and how much grain that field produces. When a chicken is placed in his hand, he can tell its weight, with little difference. Such a person, I call him "Third Uncle". Third Uncle is the eighteenth generation. People of the twentieth generation must call him "Third Uncle". Third Uncle is the third child. Third Uncle's older brother is Second Uncle, Fukang Uncle—also called Eldest Uncle. But my father calls Third Uncle "Shoukang Uncle". I almost forgot; Third Uncle's own name was originally "Shoukang", arranged according to the three characters of "Fu, Lu, Shou" (Fortune, Prosperity, Longevity). Apart from the name Shoukang, I have never heard any other name for Third Uncle. He probably doesn't have any other alias, unlike Uncle Hongru, who teaches books, whose alias is Lingxiao, also called Qingshan Hermit, with so many variations.</p>
<p>Behind my house is a large road, leading directly from the county town to the border of Jiangxi. It is an important traffic route, and there are quite a few guests coming and going. So, shops were built on both sides of the road. There were eight or nine in total, and because it was a place to rest, the first building on the west side was an inn. Many cargo carriers stopped there every night, which was quite lively. The rest included three or four wine and rice shops, a tailor shop, a grocery store, a opium den, and a closed medicinal materials store. The words "Chang'an Hall熟藥" (Chang'an Hall Prepared Medicine) still remained on the wall.</p>
<p>Counting from the west, the fourth Taian Wine and Rice Store was opened by my uncle. I inherited it from my uncle, and I mostly stayed in the store when I came back from school. During the busy farming season, my family was busy with farming, and my uncle sometimes had to go to the county town or go to market, so I would take a day off and take care of the business in the store. Among the many drinkers, Third Uncle was also a regular customer. Unless my family's wine was sold out, he would not go to other stores. He always praised my uncle's wine for being good, with bubbles filling the cup—real "piled flower liquor". He also praised me, saying that I was so young, but I could write accounts and greet customers. Third Uncle had a fixed amount of alcohol. He didn't say anything, just four taels of liquor and two spiced dried tofu; if you asked him, he would say, "Nephew, you know." Most of the time, I poured the wine for him, but sometimes he would pour it himself. After pouring the wine, he would squat on the bench outside the counter, shrug his shoulders, take a sip of wine, hold it in his mouth for a while, and then slowly swallow it. Then he would bite into a piece of spiced dried tofu, chew it slowly, and then take another sip of wine. I liked Third Uncle, so I poured him a little more when pouring wine. Once, my uncle came out of the study and saw that I had poured too much, he raised his eyebrows and glared at me, and after Third Uncle went out, he said, "Don't pour too much, just fill it up, if you keep doing this, you won't even have enough to sell the fields." "Pour a little more for Third Uncle, it's not the same for others." "Is Third Uncle's money bigger than others'? The bigger it is, the stupider it is." But as long as my uncle was not around, I would secretly pour a little more wine for Third Uncle.</p>

<p>— Long Gong Gong</p>
<p>When Zhu Wu was losing his mind because of gambling, he would talk to me about lengthy things. Most of those words were about his wives. There was a time when I mistakenly thought he was a three-wives-and-four-concubines character, not a poor and stingy congee shop owner.</p>
<p>"Alas, gambling this thing—no wonder people say that only smart people suffer from gambling, look, today, I've lost again!"</p>
<p>At the kitchen entrance at the stern of the ship, on the hatch covered with thick canvas, or on the deck, he would say those words to me when he met me, as if he had done something wrong to me and had to find a reason to explain to me.</p>
<p>"There is no losing without gambling, you can only see fish when the pond is dry."</p>
<p>"The pond is dry? ... But my boss lady who manages the pond is too stupid!" he said as if he was about to cry, raising his fist and hitting his own temples. "If she understood your words, she wouldn't be fighting with me so desperately, not letting go of a single penny... But, let's talk about something else."</p>
<p>His sad face, shriveled, crooked, would occasionally arouse people's pity, but due to the experience gained on the ship in the past few days, I knew that he probably wouldn't talk about anything else. It would still be about how he married a certain wife at some point, and then married another. His face would flush with a more lovely bright red color, and his yellow waxy skin would be baked by the hot fire, drying up and curling.</p>
<p>The transparent cloud shadows unique to autumn reflected the pure blue, brave, and clean surface of the sea, so there was a kind of grand, dizzying light that enveloped us.</p>
<p>"Knowing what people are not well-meaning towards you, and having guilty consciences that are difficult to explain to you, you must forget them immediately. Then you will be blessed."</p>
<p>Every place on him that could store things was filled with worldly lessons. Some of them were ignorant, unreasonable, and very funny. But for Zhu Wu himself, he was only happy when he took out these reserves and bragged to others.</p>
<p>"I have married three wives. Think about it, if that's the case, how much can a person understand! The first one was called Ajiao Jie, she was a working 'Ama Jie' who went to Beiping with her master. I knew why she wanted to go with her master, but we 'lived together' without negotiating the price, so I didn't ask her, and I didn't wait for her. The second one was called Qiaodi, she was a Ningbo woman of unknown origin, she gave birth to a daughter for me, but she was more noisy than my daughter, so I simply sold them both to Singapore. The third one was also bought with money, she gambled on lottery all day long, I lost a lot of money to her, once I beat her hard, and she hanged herself. Now, what you see is my wife, this is the fourth one; in fact, besides creating trouble for me, there is nothing else, and there will be none."</p>
<p>Sometimes he would add:</p>
<p>"In short, if they want to spend a few of your money and make you suffer a little loss for them, there are so many ways!"</p>
<p>I could not agree with his opinion, painfully opened my mouth and looked at him, unable to find words to refute him. He was very clear about me, knowing that I had never been married and was very poor.</p>
<p>"What do you have to be so proud of? Everything you can do, they can do. Drinking, smoking, what else?" I finally said calmly. "From the first day you were born, you have received the grace of women. No matter what kind of disaster they are in, they are calm and virtuous. How many men drink alcohol? Selling themselves overseas, killing people, or killing themselves, but women always live patiently. Letting themselves not live, and raising you."</p>
<p>"Okay, according to you, what position should we give women to sit in? - I don't understand your words at all, and you don't understand mine."</p>
<p>He simply expressed his doubts like this, and went to the deck to stand blankly next to any gambling game. Sometimes he would stand there for an hour or two before stretching lazily and listlessly crawling down into the hold.</p>
<p>When he won money, he would jump to the side of the ship and shout to the great, boundless blue sea:</p>
<p>"On my head there were originally the two words widower,</p>
<p>Now that I have a wife, and she,</p>
<p>Reaches out to pick them off for me..."</p>
<p>His singing method was very strange, as if he had created it himself with genius. Many "uh-ya, uh-ya" interludes were inserted in the middle of the turbid nasal sounds. Sometimes, listening to it, it felt as if he had quickly patched together pieces of popular stage songs, piece by piece.</p>
<p>Sometimes he would make peculiar moves that others could not imitate, showing the depth to which he was falling into happiness. He would throw away an empty tin can, make a certain athletic posture, and say in his mouth:</p>
<p>"Goodbye for now, we'll meet again in the future, go!" With that, he threw the small piece of waste into the sea. Attracted by the waves, it quickly and involuntarily retreated backwards, and soon disappeared far behind.</p>
<p>Zhu Wu began to explain to me how the friendship between the sea and the ship had deteriorated, and what kind of relationship they now maintained.</p>
<p>"The sea is smart, strong, and gentle," he said, drawing circles in the air with one arm. "But all the ships are sorry for it. - That is, they dump a lot of coal slag on it every day. It can't stand it, so every time it sees a ship passing by, it shows its teeth. Look at these waves, why does the sea have waves? ... The ship still dumps coal slag on it, cunningly passing through the gaps in its teeth, making it so angry that it spits out white foam from its mouth..."</p>
<p>He often used this beautiful imagination to entertain himself, or others that he liked.</p>

<p>— by German author Storm, translated by Chen Yin Zhi</p>
<p>'A bastard, eh? - His face is indeed that of a bastard!'</p>
<p>'Nelly, then?' I asked, staring at my friend. 'Did she go to the dancing-school of your 'Latins' and caper with this pale-faced knight of her own free will?'</p>
<p>He contracted his brow, and I saw a haze of sleepy cloud pass into his eyes.</p>
<p>'I do not know,' he murmured. - 'You ought not to have dragged the little girl to dance at your 'Latins' school to fill up the number, just as an excuse.'</p>
<p>He stretched his hand out to me. 'Farewell, Philip!' he said, 'The money, I will send back to you; otherwise, you will not hear from me; but a year hence, if God wills, I shall come here again, or return to our home.'</p>
<p>He went away. - I tried to continue the reading of my book, but it was altogether impossible; care for the future fate of this companion of my childhood, occupied my mind. All that had not been plainly spoken by his words, I understood; I knew that his whole soul was filled with the image of that girl, and that this strong head was exerting all its powers for the one object, that his life might be united with hers.</p>
<p>I went down soon after to the apartments of the landlady, with whom I boarded. I was perhaps a little too early, for not one of the other lodgers had yet come; but in the little side-room I found the seamstress, the 'Lame Mary', silently and solitarily sewing among a heap of white linen. - As I often saw her walking with the two whom I now felt so deep an interest in, I told her yesterday's story, in the hope that I might learn from her its true explanation.</p>
<p>'I knew it would be so!' she said, closing her thin lips very tightly; 'the carpenter was indeed good in every way, but too compliant towards the little girl. - Why go with her to the dancing-room?'</p>
<p>I urged her to further explanations.</p>
<p>She laid a portion of the linen aside, and cleared a chair that I might sit down. - 'You perhaps know the little shop in Monk's Alley,' she began, when I, interpreting her look, had sat down on the chair; 'that old Smidten, Nelly's aunt, some years ago bought this cottage of the man who lets out horses in the neighborhood; but the garden behind it, the seller kept back, still uniting it with his own, because he required the open space for his business; the old woman could only wash and bleach her linen in a little space of grass in the middle of the court, but this space was sufficient for her. She was a cousin of my deceased mother, and I used to go out with her to needlework, after my fourteenth year.'</p>
<p>'I remember that, a little before Martinmas last year, I went to the Smidten's after dinner, because we had a lot of silk goods to wash. On the road I met the carpenter, who had been already going to and coming from Nelly, and we talked a few words together, at parting he even said to me, smiling: 'I shall come on the evening before the feast-day, to help you in hanging up the linen that has been washed.' I repeated these words to Nelly, but she did not seem to pay much attention to them.'</p>

<h3 id="e188">Abyssinia Can Console Itself <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>A country must save itself before others save it. The sound of war drums in Abyssinia has recently aroused the sympathy of people from all countries. According to reports, people from all countries who are willing to provide assistance are very enthusiastic.</p>
<p>London: Some retired British officers have organized mercenaries to go to Abyssinia to help fight. Recently, they have been secretly recruiting soldiers in London and other provinces to go to Abyssinia next month.</p>
<p>New York: Hundreds of black people here have volunteered to serve Abyssinia. Although the Abyssinian king has not yet approved of this move by American black people, the black people here have not hesitated in the slightest to support Abyssinia's resistance against Italy.</p>
<p>London: An American company here is willing to provide Abyssinia with 50 skilled pilots and one doctor, and another company is willing to provide a large number of military officers and a large amount of ammunition.</p>
<p>America: Black man Davis, who served as a junior officer during the European War, has recently been recruiting soldiers, preparing to serve Abyssinia when the Italian-Abyssinian War breaks out.</p>
<p>Berlin: Austrian National Socialists who have been expelled from the country are now mobilizing to assist Abyssinia in fighting against Italy.</p>
<p>I often say that there is no justice in today's world. If there is, it is probably the law of the jungle? But are weak nations so easily subdued? Abyssinia's unyielding spirit is enough for the weak to breathe a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Abyssinia is a small and weak nation. It wants to resist an old-fashioned fascist power, just like a mantis trying to stop a chariot, which is often seen as overestimating its own capabilities. However, the Abyssinian king refuses to give in at all. He delivered an impassioned speech to the Chamber of Nobles the other day, in which he said that warriors should emulate the bravery of their ancestors, regardless of age, and jointly defend against the invaders. If necessary, their king will shed blood on the battlefield for Abyssinia and its independence without hesitation. It is better to die for freedom than to live as a slave for ten thousand years. If a peaceful solution cannot be found at the last minute, Abyssinia will reach out to God for grace. Such a generous and passionate spirit cannot help but make people prostrate themselves.</p>
<p>But strong countries ultimately help strong countries. Even if weak countries have justice and fairness, they cannot eat anything. Therefore, recently, the governments of various countries are discussing refusing to supply Abyssinia with ammunition, which cannot but discourage Abyssinia. However, the world's justice has not completely died after all. Observing that people from all countries are willing to help Abyssinia, they have risen one after another. Abyssinia can also be proud of itself.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Child <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Yun</p>
<p>The child has grown even more adorable: wearing a newly bought sailor suit, and my hat, which is twice the size of his head, his eyes and nose are buried in the hat like a watermelon, he raises his hand in a military salute. This is one example. He knows so much, even though he is only two years and two months old.</p>
<p>Today, when he returned from his grandmother's house, the first thing he said when he ran into the house was "Grandma—board—buy—melon—," while stretching out both hands as if I couldn't write an article, circling in the small room. He was also like a great orator, repeating "Grandma, board, buy, melon," over and over, which was quite amusing.</p>
<p>After walking for a while, perhaps suddenly thinking about the taste of the melon that Grandma bought, he threw himself onto my knees, raised his head, his small eyes as big as waxberries, and said, "Daddy, buy—melon—fresh (sweet)!"</p>
<p>I didn't answer him, as I was thinking about something else, a look the child was used to. "Daddy—earn—board," he thought I was going to write an article, so he went under the table and said to his mother:</p>
<p>"Melon—gone!" He raised his small palms to the sky, not knowing where he had learned this gesture.</p>
<p>His wife then coaxed him, "Daddy will buy it tomorrow," while telling me that the child had seen the watermelon his grandmother carried down and had been playing with it, but he couldn't move any of them. When it was time to go home, he even tried to move the biggest watermelon. "We really should buy one tomorrow, it's so hot!" his wife finally said.</p>
<p>"Mom!" the child immediately jumped over, making a circular shape with his little hands, "Fresh—melon—buy!"</p>
<p>He gestured and spun in a circle, suddenly shouting "Hat! Hat!" "Daddy—Hat! Hat!"</p>
<p>This was different from the fresh watermelon; he burst into loud cries.</p>
<p>His wife immediately picked him up and coaxed him: Daddy will buy you watermelon tomorrow, fresh ones, and also, a hat. But the child ignored her, he just kept crying, using his small hands to make a circular shape, shouting "Hat! Hat!"</p>
<p>I felt a little uncomfortable. The child was just being unreasonable, wanting watermelons and hats. There were many more important things we hadn't bought for our house, and perhaps the rice bucket would tell me tonight that we needed money. But the child cried even harder; he had never cried so intensely since he was born. Since he had come into this world as a person, crying couldn't resist the pressure of being wronged!</p>
<p>His wife seemed to be out of options, holding him in one arm and waving a foreign doll at him to coax him.</p>
<p>Last year, when the child turned one, we took him to the department store to buy a set of flannel shirts and pants as a gift. When we got to the toy section, he started babbling excitedly. He saw a large foreign doll on the counter that raised its hand in salute. He cried and wanted to buy it, but after seeing the price tag, I finally carried him away. Naturally, his crying didn't stop, so his wife bought a small toy to coax him home.</p>
<p>From then on, the child learned to salute and often shouted "Doll." His little heart couldn't forget that fun thing. This spring, I mustered my courage several times and bought a bugle-playing foreign doll for him. The child was overjoyed; he wanted the doll as soon as he woke up in the morning and wanted to hug it to sleep at night. His wife specially made a set of small clothes for it, and the child was always holding it in his hands, imitating his mother's attitude. But today, the foreign doll's misfortune had arrived. When his wife handed it to him, the child forcefully threw it down, but he was still not satisfied. He squeezed down from his mother's arms and trampled the foreign doll into a flat pancake.</p>
<p>My anger rose. How could he have such a big temper at such a young age? Didn't he know how hard it was to buy this foreign doll and make a new set of clothes! I jumped up from the chair, wanting to give him a beating; but the child was smart. He immediately threw himself at my knees, waving his little hands and calling "Daddy," wanting me to hold him. His wife, afraid that I would really hit him, coaxed him to go to bed—he still whispered to his wife that he wanted to buy a hat.</p>
<p>This happened a month ago. I was carrying him back from the park, and when we walked past a very large foreign goods store, the glass cabinet was hanging with all kinds of children's hats. The child immediately clamored to buy one. I told him that Daddy didn't have any money, that we would buy a good one in a few days. He nodded in agreement, but he wasn't as agreeable as he had been with the foreign doll. After so many days, I still haven't been able to fulfill his advance wish. The child transferred his anger to the foreign doll—perhaps he understood a little about the ways of the world.</p>
<p>But until other matters are settled, although I sincerely want to buy him a hat, I'm afraid it will never be possible. I just hope he doesn't dream about making hats tonight!</p>

<h3 id="e190">On the Ship <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>In the sweltering heat of a June day, even disembarking at midnight was oppressively hot. Just getting the luggage settled, large beads of sweat had already soaked my forehead, and even the innermost layer of my undershirt was drenched. And the ship's peculiar odor of kerosene, the musty smell of rust, and the indescribably filthy, mixed stench evaporated in waves around my nose, irritating me. It was almost unbearable enough to make me vomit. So, I had no choice but to temporarily escape this stifling atmosphere, take the handrail, step onto the deck to catch some wind, stand in front of the iron railing, and gaze at the distant night seascape.</p>
<p>From the narrow walkway that connected to the staircase, stretching to the middle of the ship's hull, was entirely the steerage area. Each passenger had already claimed their spot for their mat, spreading them out haphazardly, east and west, lying crowded together, some standing and a few sitting together, chatting idly. Hawkers soliciting business on the ship weaved through the crowds, calling out their wares. Added to this, the sound of the engine turning and the noise of various voices created an extraordinary cacophony.</p>
<p>This symphonic chaos continued until late into the night, gradually quieting down. Now, only the small waves crashed against the ship's hull, one after another, creating light, brittle sounds.</p>
<p>In the silence, a sighing voice suddenly said behind me, speaking to someone:</p>
<p>"Alas, having become such a useless person, how can I face my relatives? Our ancestors didn't leave us three plots of land or two houses, and I have a wife, children, and an old mother to support. Who will feed us? How will we get through the days? It would have been better to have been beaten to death that time."</p>
<p>"Well, whether we live or die, we can't worry about it ourselves. Let's just go back and see what happens. If there's food, we'll all eat together. If there's no food, we'll all go hungry,"</p>
<p>The person answering seemed more optimistic, comforting the other person, but after speaking, they both sighed deeply.</p>
<p>"Damn it, we're human beings too, why should we sacrifice our lives for nothing, letting those dogs and rabbits trample on us, using us as footrests!"</p>
<p>The person speaking became more agitated, his voice filled with extreme resentment.</p>
<p>"Don't talk about it, it's no use. Just blame ourselves for being weak. We're destined to suffer our whole lives."</p>
<p>The conversation between the two gradually became clearer. Then, several people, seemingly awakened from a light sleep, yawned, turned over laboriously, and then someone asked:</p>
<p>"What are you talking about so excitedly? Don't you want to sleep! Isn't it late?"</p>
<p>"You... you're so lucky, you can fall asleep as soon as you lie down."</p>
<p>One of the two answered with a cold laugh.</p>
<p>Sighs escaped from everyone's throats, lingering mournfully in the silent night.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Quarrel <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Ling Zixi</p>
<p>The weather is getting hotter day by day: first, the more than half a month of drought in the rice paddies, the sun blazing like fire, from early morning to dusk, as if determined to bake this field into ashes; people worked desperately on the waterwheels during the day for those delicate seedlings, the lifeblood, and in the evening, they stared blankly at a coarse meal, their hearts agitated beyond belief—as if a scorching sun was roasting them. And half a month ago, with difficulty, there were several heavy rains, and people were happy, as if a pile of stones had been removed from their hearts, but unexpectedly, the rain did not stop; rice paddies were not like seedling beds, they were no longer suitable for a large amount of water, and the weather gradually cooled down, and the melons and fruits in the fields were no longer worth much money. The worst thing was that the water kept pouring down, and the low-lying areas had already started to flood; in this way, the hope and joy that people had raised were once again cooled down, and this cold water seemed to have flowed into their hearts, and just thinking about it would make people panic and tremble.</p>
<p>Because of this, people no longer had a sense of peace, but were just going around in circles in worry and anxiety. With an agitated mood and grim faces, everyone just wanted to be temperamental. So, they scolded chickens and dogs, and even lost their pleasant tone.</p>
<p>In the fields, disputes over the arrears of one or two liters of grain were common: faces flushed red, they spoke loudly in the dialect of the fields, saliva spraying like unstoppable raindrops, arguing, cursing, and fighting. In the middle of this, a mixture of resentment, panic, and emotionality was intricately mixed, like a tangled knot.</p>
<p>In the family, people also learned to be rude from their worries, and it was not surprising that wives resented their husbands and husbands beat their wives because life was not going very well. Because the man went out to borrow rice but couldn't, or spent some of the money from selling the only piece of homespun cloth: he bought liquor, drank himself drunk, and came back reeking of alcohol; of course, the wife would not let it go, grabbing the man and making a deadly scene; life was difficult, how could he want to turn the whole family into yellow soup? "You immortal drunkard, I've been married to you my whole life and haven't had a single good day. You still have the heart to pour the money the whole family worked so hard for down your throat! I've had enough of living, I don't want to live anymore, you wretch, I'll fight you to the death..."</p>
<p>Crying,闹ing, and the man, with liquor in his stomach and irritation in his heart, all the unpleasantness of life taught him a kind of terrible barbarity, his eyes turned red, he dragged the woman over without saying a word, grabbed her hair, and punched her body desperately: "I, I... I've had enough of living, you all go to hell!"</p>
<p>"Hit me, hit me, it's okay if you hit me to death, I'll fight you, I'll fight you to the death..."</p>
<p>Crying,闹ing, cursing, and fighting; the long night passed by heavily. When they woke up the next day, they still harbored an unspeakable resentment and anger. Thinking about it carefully, there was no reason for any of this; however, it always stuck in people's hearts like a thorn, how uncomfortable!</p>
<p>In the fields, in the village, daily quarrels followed the difficulties of life, drifting like summer rain: after passing, it happened again. This, like a comedy of life, was being staged intermittently; however, everyone felt that this was definitely not a comedy. Everyone remembered: their original temperament didn't seem to be like this at all, but now, life seemed to have sprinkled a little spicy pepper into people's temperament, making people unknowingly agitated and uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Perhaps, these unprovoked, unpleasant quarrels followed fate and the years; perhaps this was a gust of wind that would soon calm down?</p>

<p>— Lu Sun</p>
<p>Like being bitten in the heart by a venomous snake, like being bound in the limbs by a soft rope, unable to move freely, in short, something indescribable entangled me on all sides; sometimes I simply had no place in this world to put my own body. This kind of suffering relentlessly tormented me day and night, so on rainy days, I would rush out the door in a raincoat, like an office worker going to work; it was as if there were ghosts in my house, and I wanted to escape that kind of torment. However, when the cold raindrops hit me, I felt it was too pointless. What was the point of rushing out the door? I couldn't turn back, so I just followed my feet, but actually, my legs wouldn't have any ideas. Walking along one road after another, so slowly: watching the streetcars drive back and forth on the tracks, watching the rickshaw pullers bend their backs to resist the oncoming wind, perhaps I hoped that a beautiful woman would do a somersault from the car's canopy, which would make me laugh heartily for a while. People seemed like crazy people, without any ideas: but they had too many to be arranged. For example: I passed a friend's house, I thought in my heart, I'll go in and chat for a while. Naturally, I pressed the doorbell, and my friend invited me in, whether they were close or unfamiliar. As soon as I sat down, a second idea scolded me for being meddlesome, and I immediately found a question that they couldn't answer and left them. But as soon as I stepped out the door, I asked myself again, wouldn't it be good to sit for a while?</p>
<p>Although all my actions were a bit abnormal, I often regretted them afterward, and I was determined never to do it again in the future; however, when I was ambushed by that indescribable pain, I was not allowed to have any worries. When these actions fell into my friends' eyes, they all said that I was "bored." I myself didn't admit it, and sometimes this question would cause my long-winded arguments, and even the matter of falling out with my closest friends happened often.</p>
<p>Recently, a classmate from my childhood got married, and many old friends gathered at the wedding feast. Perhaps they were well-intentioned, and they united to attack me: saying that I was perverted, saying that I was probably caught in the web of love again, using various methods to provoke me. I was very annoyed in my heart. Under normal circumstances, I would definitely leave without saying goodbye. It was inexcusable in every way to use such vicious words to make fun of a friend who was tormented by suffering. But that day was my friend's auspicious day, and as the host, I didn't want to spoil their fun like that; so I also seized on everyone's handles and looked for ways to retaliate. Later, almost all of my friends' unmentionable secrets were exposed by me, and I felt more pleased than ever before. When they publicly elected me to be the leader of the wedding night antics, I regained that energy and poured down several glasses of liquor.</p>
<p>That day, I completely changed into a different person, making so much noise, and using all kinds of playful and smiling tricks. I knew from everyone's faces that they were also very happy. They thought that I had been rescued from the abyss of pain. They proposed organizing a progress association or something, so that so many friends would have the opportunity to meet often. They wanted to reform me, and I was also willing to be reformed by them: my heart was saved, my limbs regained their freedom, within those few hours.</p>
<p>But when I bid farewell to the host and returned home, as soon as I stepped into my cramped dwelling, those invisible ropes bound my limbs again. The subtle happiness I had just gained was replaced by more painful memories. It was a moonlit night, plastering the world with a silver light. In this silver light, I could see humans very clearly: they could only unite for their own benefit, otherwise they were all alone. Friends—even my parents and wife were linked together by that kind of relationship. So, that indescribable pain, perhaps it was the loneliness of being alone? I lived so lonely in this world!</p>

<p>The new era's new film "Mr. Wang Goes to the Countryside" is about to start filming. Yesterday, the entire crew was gathered to discuss the plot. Laughter never stopped during the discussion. When it came to a certain segment, little A Yuan Huang Naishuang clapped and laughed loudly, repeatedly praising it as wonderful.</p>
<p>In "Mr. Wang Goes to the Countryside," because he is living in the countryside, Mr. Wang and his wife and children have all changed into rural attire. Little Chen, because he is playing the role of a relief committee member, has also changed from a Western suit to a Chinese suit in order to match the identity of the character in the play.</p>

<p>The interior scenes for the Yihua talkie "The Tempest," which has been in preparation and filming for more than a year, have finally been completely shot.</p>
<p>In this film: Yuan Meiyun plays the innocent and lively Lingling, Wei Heling plays Wei Mingda, who is struggling in unemployment, Zhu Naidong plays Zhao Baiyun, who is brave and righteous, Cang Yinqiu plays the silly elder sister Xiao Baizi, Qin Tong plays the bitter old man, Jin Yi plays a Turk, Zhang Zhizhi plays the villain who does all kinds of evil, Guan Hongda plays a rogue, child star Liu Li plays a bitter child, and "Fugitive" director Yue Feng plays a Japanese as an exception, and speaks Japanese. The roles are distributed very appropriately, so everyone's acting skills have developed extraordinarily. Yesterday, director Yuan Congmei specially led the entire crew to take the ship that set sail at six o'clock in the morning to Nanjing to take exterior scenes. If the weather is good, they can return to Shanghai within five days.</p>

<p>The Xinhua Film Company produced "The Peach Blossom Fan," and specially commissioned Mr. Zhang Yuguang to exquisitely paint peach blossom fans to be given to various circles. However, some restrictions had to be put in place. So, Mr. Zhang Shankun came up with a novel idea: Jin Yan, Hu Ping, Tong Yuejuan, Dai Yanwan, Wang Cilong, Gu Menghu, Zhou Fengwen, Zha Tianying, Zhang Zhizhi, and others each had a picture taken of the back of their heads. These were then cast into printing plates and published in the newspaper, allowing people to guess who they were. Those who guessed correctly could win a peach blossom fan, and the winner could designate who would inscribe the fan with a personal message.</p>

<p>(Previous omitted) That day, we arrived at the desolate Shidao Island. The fishermen on the island, for some strange reason, were watching our group, never leaving our side. Our accommodation became a problem, and after some debate, we had to temporarily settle in a dilapidated old house. At night, no one thought about sleeping, and they started talking about ghosts, using this old house as the subject. This was terrible; it caused Misses Li Ying and Fang Pei to dream of ghosts at night, and they suspected that there really were ghosts in this old house.</p>
<p>In this terrifying den, besides the low ceilings and damp ground, it was also filled with the smell of fish. Director Wang Bin, regardless of everything, started talking about the preparations for the filming tomorrow. Fu Baolu and Fang Pei read lines, Chen Tianguo and Tian Fang looked at the script, Wang Bin, Zhou Hekang, Shen Yongshi, and Zhou Yulin researched methods for shooting the sea views and the issues of camera angles, Ma Dongwu, Wei Pengfei, and others prepared everything related to the production affairs. It looked like groups of small, connected meetings.</p>
<p>The sea was howling wildly. It was late at night, and their voices gradually grew quieter. One by one, they gradually started snoring, so exhausted that they forgot everything.</p>
