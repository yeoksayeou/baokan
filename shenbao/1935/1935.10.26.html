<p>時評</p>
<h3>讀電話專家報告書節略</h3>
<p>— 道</p>
<p>公共租界工部局聘任之電話專家。其報告節略。業經披露報端。歷述上海電話公司設備之新式。服務之周到。支出之合理與必要等項。繼卽根據一九三〇年八月五日與公共租界及法租界工部局所訂特許合同保息一分之規定。確認上海電話公司採取分次收費制之允當。並代擬一價目表。規定商用電話每月打一百五十次。付費十元。家用電話。月打一百次。付費六元五角。過此以往。不論商用家用。一律每打一次。以收費三分計算。同時建議三項節省辦法。（一）節减廣告費。（二）節减話機管理等等費用。（三）裁减高薪外員。增雇低薪者。以資撙節。節略要點。大抵不外乎此。</p>
<p>報告書之全文。我人雖尚未窺見。然就其節略之。各要點觀之各專家對於上海電話公司主張之大部。已予接受。而於消費者之利益。似未能充分予以顧及。此種缺點。當為工部局指定研究範圍應有之結果。最顯然者。卽報告書對於工部局特許合同之保息一分一點。認為當然。並未計及合同訂立時之市况。與目下百業蕭條之市况。遠不相侔。在往時保息一分。雖尚合理。然於目下之不景氣情况中。實有變通之必要也。且上海電話公司所發債券。亦僅六厘。旣不滯銷。似不應加消費者以六厘以上之負担。故為公道計。為助成市面之繁榮計。似應將保息一分一點。予以六折之考慮。一俟市面恢復繁榮後。再行十足取息。蓋各業旣衰落已極。絕少利潤可圖。電話為公用事業。尤不當處於獨優之地位也。</p>
<p>分次收費之制原則。上雖似無可訾議。然今所規定。一則基本次數過少。二則額外打電之收費亦昂。一轉變問。可使用戶之負担。大見增加。按各專家之建議。卽私人電話。每月可打一百次。統扯每日僅三次。過此以往。卽須額外徵費。夫一家旣有裝電話之必要。當然為社會交際較繁者。無論如何。每日必超出三次之範圍。至於商家。每月打一百五十次。合計每日僅五次。當然去足够之程度尤遠。故連其額外之費。必將數倍於今茲。可以斷言。是一轉移間。名為合理化。不啻於無形中加價數倍也。卽以私人月付六元半而僅打一百次論。每次所費為大洋六分半。合計銅元二十餘枚。取費之昂可不待言。夫電話之最大功用。原在增加市民經濟上之利益。今每打一次。須費銅元十餘枚。則電話竟可稱為絕對的奢侈品。至商用電話。收費每次在六分六厘以上。尤不啻商界之一種苛捐矣。又據專家估計。分次取費制採取後。百分四七之私人用戶與百分四一之商家可减低費用。未知此種估計。有無統計數字之根據。蓋依此種估計。不啻斷言現有之私人用戶百分之四七皆未超過每日打電三次之範圍。商業用戶百分之四一皆未超過每日打電五次之限度。唯據我人觀感所得。事實上絕非如此。我人以為。按次取費制。雖無可訾議。然基本次數。必須增加。至少不應使基本次數之打電費超過每次三分之昂價。而額外打電每次三分。亦應酌减。或則隨次數之增加。予以相當之折扣。使商人方面。仍能保持裝置電話之利益。</p>
<p>專家建議最後提及節約各點。如廣告費之核減。管理費用之緊縮。高薪外籍職員之裁汰等項。似可規定數目。限以日期。從早推行。待其仍不足以為挹注時。再行提高通電價目。以期用戶方面之負担。不致先增。再則報告書節略中。雖建議公司贏餘過多時。應再付調查。然於屆時能否核减用戶費用一層。似未涉及。未知該報告書全文中。有無考慮及此。我人之意。公用事業。首應考慮消費者之利益。尤應注意一般之經濟狀况。不應於百業衰落之中。獨求電話公司利潤之高厚也。</p>

<h3>解决意阿爭端　三國仍進行接洽　談話僅屬探詢性質　未臻實際政治階級　法外部否認意相提新建議　意撤利比亞駐軍和緩歐局</h3>
<p>（羅馬）據半官方面發言人宣稱、目前在巴黎羅馬倫敦間進行關於解决意阿爭端之談判、僅屬一般的傳達消息之性質、並無何種具體計畫作談判之基礎、又據哈瓦斯社訪員探悉、意政府雖贊成與英法舉行直接談判、但亦不反對在日內瓦機構內，解决意阿問題，政界人士以為在直接談判及國聯會處理二者之問、尚可覔得各項折中辦法、例如巴拉圭與玻利維亞兩國間之大厦谷爭端、卽係由南美各隣邦居間調停、獲得解决後、仍由國聯會行政院加以核准、可見直接談判與國聯會處理、二者並不背道而馳也云、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）據此間政界表示意見、以為一般人士殷望刻巴黎羅馬間進行之和平探詢、在數日之內可有着落、或十月三十一日調整制裁委員會開會以期决定實施制裁日期時、可有展緩實施此種制裁之正當情由、現無甚因素可證實此種希望、外交上交換意見之進行、現因隨時通告英政府、但同時可謂英國今不過為一旁觀人而已、此間現信法總理賴伐爾自亦以為羅馬與巴黎間之和平談話、尚未臻實際政治之階段、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）官塲人士宣稱、英國政府準備在十一月初間實施對意財政經濟制裁、以為意阿爭端未必能在實施制裁之前得到解决方案、緣意國建議由巴黎方面轉到者、雖可證明意國已在調解方面有所努力、但未可作為未來談判之切實基礎云、官塲人士以為各項建議、凡主張將阿國領土區分為本部與所征服之土地者（卽不屬於阿姆哈里克各省）使此等土地仍歸阿皇管轄轄英國亦在原則上予以反對、蓋當一九二三年阿國要求加入國聯會時、意國對阿國前皇美尼里克所征服之十地、卽哈拉爾蒂格里沃迦登各省、業已承認其為阿國領土也、除此而外、意國近日舉動最足使人滿意者、乃撤退利比亞軍隊、并將其調回本國、而不照原議留駐股利波里丹殖民地是也、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）官方人士宣稱、英法意三國關於解决意阿爭端之談判、其目的乃在澄清國際空氣、並决定進行程序、曁對於基本問題所當採取之立場、尚未有確定之綱領云、據本社訪員所知、此次之事、係由某國與意阿爭端無直接關係者、向雙方當事國提出建議、俾一方籍以明瞭對方見解、此種建議、並無具體形式、具體方案必俟程序問題解决之後、始可提出、至程序問題、則為英國所深切注意者也、此間政界人士以為英國下議院改選在卽、英意兩國談判因而難於進行、一俟十一月十四日選舉結束之後、則意阿爭端解决協定、當可在短時期內宣告成立、但國聯會所决定之經濟制裁手段實行之後或致引起困難、則又當別論矣、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）各報登載消息、謂意相墨索里尼已向賴伐爾總理提出解决意阿爭端之新建議、且已於今晨由賴伐爾通知英國駐法大使克拉克云、外交部頃加以否認、謂並無其事、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）據官方宣稱、外傳法國總理兼外長賴伐爾已以意國政府所提事、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>意新建議所傳內容</p>
<p>（巴黎）關於意國政府所提解决意阿爭端之新建議、雖經英法兩國政府加以否認、但此間事業報則發表此項新建議之要點如下、（一）意國决將駐意屬利比亞軍隊撤退兩師、并不要求以英國撤退地中海軍艦為交換條件、（二）一俟英國政府提出復文後、意國允卽停止戰事、（三）在接獲英國復文之前、意國不再向東非洲續派軍隊、（四）意國建議英國如認為可予接受、則當向國聯會十八國小組委員會暨行政院五國委員提出之、意國政府認為以上四項建議、係該國之最大讓步、至於意國所提要求之內容、據事業報所知、并不主張將阿國哈拉爾·沃迦登·蒂格里數省、作為意國保護國或委任統治地、但僅要求以各該省作為意國租借地、而保全阿皇在名義上之主權、此外五國委員會前此所建議之國際援助計劃、則當在阿國本部領土內實行之、意大利并應允不在上述租借地內編練土著軍隊、但得組織警察、其數額與軍備則可由一九零六年三國條約簽字國、卽英法意三國加以監察、此外阿國本部則得組織常備軍、由阿皇統率、但該國居民則應一律解除武裝云、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（羅馬）此間今日正式宣布政府己下令撤退駐利比亞之兵一師團據公報聲稱、此項侖令乃意政府獨立行動、英政府未予同樣之擔任、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）此問今日正式宣布、意軍一師團將由利比亞立刻撤回本國、惟英國不必减少地中海駐艦數目以為答覆云、外交界對於此項布告語氣非常和平、殊為驚奇、因一般人皆以為意國將堅持交換條件也、據外部發言人稱、此舉應視為意國對於維持歐洲和平之貢獻云、（二十四日國民電）</p>

<p>馬爾泰島伐勒泰　此間當局今日表示、英國不擬撤退地中海方面之艦隊、已於「胡特」號及「利能」號二戰艦、其派來地中海時、意國軍隊之集中、尚屬完全尋常性質、故現在意國雖由利比亞撤退一師團、大概仍未能改變英國之海軍政策、今日並悉、意國潛艇最近曾在英國領海中活動、以使英國决定暫不撤退任何軍艦之說、更覺有力云、（二十西日國民電）</p>

<p>（華盛頓）據可靠方面消息、國務總理赫爾今日與羅斯福總統會晤、曾談及美國對於國聯對意實施制裁之態度、及倫敦海軍會議之美國代表問題、赫氏今日與總統在白宮同進午膳、當時談話之主題、卽為答覆國聯之制裁問題、總統及赫氏對於對意禁運軍火一事、頗為注意、政府顧問亦意見分歧、根據國會所通過之中立法、總統究竟是否有權可以宣布此項禁令、殊難取决云、（二十四日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）自國務院接獲國聯會關於對意制裁之節略後、羅斯福總統已與國務卿赫爾討論三次、他日如何作答、因當局嚴守秘密、外間無所聞知、赫爾並曾與國務院人員長談、但並未諮詢戰時中立法問題各專家、若干人士遂乃斷定國務院尚未起草複文、且在下星期初間之前、不致向國聯會提出復文（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>國勞代表秘書　張導民昨返國　考察各國勞工現狀及農村經濟　對我國勞工組織亦有意見發表</h3>
<p>上海社云、我國出席國際勞工大會工方代表王錦霞、早經返國、秘書張導民氏、因赴各國考察勞工狀况、及農村經濟、始於昨日乘長崎丸返國、寓新亞酒店、上海社記者特趨訪張氏、據談經過甚詳、茲分誌如次、</p>
<p>考察經過</p>
<p>張氏於五月十日、隨國勞代表出國、六月四日出席國勞大會、廿六日閉慕後、卽赴意大利·奧國·捷克·德國·丹麥·比國·荷蘭·英國·法國·波蘭·俄國·日本·等國考察勞工現狀及農村經濟、昨日由日每次長崎丸抵滬、關於國勞大會情形、已有報告公布、故未談及、</p>
<p>各國狀况</p>
<p>張氏首謂、歐州各國勞工狀况已上軌道、尤以英法兩國為最、英國工業發達、已有八十餘年之歷史、德國則所有工人、自小至老、一生如能工作、不愁沒有飯吃、其勞工保險制度、辦理成精殊佳、德國勞工政策、係勞工陣綫、勞資打成一片、雖在經濟恐慌之下、而失業者甚少、其少數失業者亦能生活、故能恢複經濟繁榮、意大利正依勞工自由與勞工福利的路上走、其組織有職業組合、但工人之福利、均在國家利益之下求得、離開國家利益、則工人福利談不到、俄國勞工情形、與德相似、惟制度不同而已、蘭於農業方面、丹麥之農業合作、與俄國之集體農塲、頗有成績、</p>
<p>張氏意見</p>
<p>中國與西歐相比、當然相差很遠、惟欲求經濟繁榮、工業發展、須從勞工方面着手、而中國之機械工人、與農業工人、尤不能分離、中國的經濟基礎、應確業勞動、而欲得農業勞動之效果、須用農業合作的辦法、並有整個計劃以組織之、故中國勞工運動、將來必須有一新的組織、在國家整個利益之下、使勞資打成一片、才能謀得真正的勞工利益云、</p>

<h3>小男兒（七）（五）</h3>
<p>— 美國奧爾珂德女士原著鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>小梅見到了這點禮意的殷勤，心裏歡喜，也便好生相待，並且約她往嬰兒室裏去坐坐，那知南恩偏說道，「不，我要去看男孩子們和那個倉庫」說着便跑去了一路用帽帶在揮舞着她的帽子，後來帽帶斷了，帽子飛往草地上隨風吹着，她還是向着她的目的地前進，略不掉頭一顧的。</p>
<p>童子們望見她來了，齊聲喊道，「哈囉，南恩！」她躍進了他們的隊伍裏，得意地揚言道：</p>
<p>「我要來這兒住了！」</p>
<p>「壑雷！了不得！」一陣喊聲從璧上而來，仰頭一看，不是田田別人而是韜摩，他原是高棲在壁上，他和南恩是一個模型的，因此聽見她要長住，預料到將來的「玩意兒」正多着呢。</p>
<p>「我可以來個打棍手：讓我試試看」，南恩說道，她什麼事都來得，並且從不怕折磨與打擊的。</p>
<p>「我們現在球已玩好子，可是我們這一邊沒有你的帮助也已勝過了他們」。</p>
<p>「且慢，在賽跑這一件事上，我要勝過你們了，」南恩回答道，她覺得還有這一點可以自誇的。</p>
<p>「眞的她能够麼？」乃德問解各到。</p>
<p>「一個女孩子總算跑得很好了，」解客回答道，他俯視南恩，根神氣地表示他的讀許。</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （干瑜）</p>
<p>過去的罪惡，可懺悔於今日；將來的偉大，唯有創造於今日。——人生的旅途中，只有「今日」是最賓貴的最重要的！</p>
<p>雖是「世風日下」，並非「人心不古」，若說古人都是改善的，請問堯舜之世，何來四兇？</p>
<p>訥訥寡言者，未必一定是「愚」；喋喋利口者，未必一定是「智」。</p>
<p>有當面譽我的人，不如無背後毀我的人。</p>
<p>天下事要是認眞起來，則事事皆難滿意；要是能够達觀，則處處都是樂境。</p>
<p>要拿着「希望」前進，不能拿着「希望」等待。</p>
<p>勞心者役人，並不是喚你壓迫他，勞力者役於人，並不是喚你做他的奴隸。</p>
<p>天堂是你，地獄也是你，只看你自己作為的是些什麼。</p>
<h3>不忘本</h3>
<p>— 顔</p>
<p>聽說馮玉祥每天要把他的兒子喚到面前，問他一聲「你的老子是做什麼的」？他兒子亦必回答道：「我老子是當兵的。」這是馮氏因為自己出身行伍，吃盡千辛萬苦，以致今日的地位，叫兒子不可祇知他今日而忘了他昔日，給他一個不忘本的好敎訓。</p>
<p>因為馮氏之敎子不忘本，我連帶想到上海三個巨家的以不忘本垂為家訓之事來。一個姓李，他們死了不久的××老先生，在前淸時做過官，在民國時也在地方上做過不少有益的公共事業，受人人的愛戴。可是，他幼時很艱苦，曾在鐵舖子裏當一學徒，每天在爐子旁擔任拉風箱的工作。後來他感到這工作的沒出息，毅然他圖，由苦讀書而得到入學中舉，一官半職。至此他鑒於自己的生於憂患，深恐子孫之死於安樂，就在供奉祖宗牌位的家堂裏，做了一個小小的風箱供奉着，叫後代子孫看了這東西，不忘祖宗之出身於艱苦，而時時惕勵。一個姓陳，祖上是由挑了副擔去街頭巷尾收買舊貨而發財的。他怕後代子孫忘了本而驕奢淫佚起來，所以也在家堂裏放上一副舊貨挑，垂為永遠的家敎。還有一個是張姓，家堂裏有一對挑水桶，也是用以昭垂子孫，叫他們在享樂之中，不要忘了祖宗之由挑水起家。這三巨家堂裏的三種東西，都很有效力，因為迄乎今日，這三家子孫都能不忘本而克紹箕裘啊。</p>
<p>古來每有人一旦由微賤中平步入靑雲，便把過去的事忘之惟恐不速，更不願留絲亳舊跡於子孫的腦袋裏，所以老子手裏的富或貴，一到兒子手裏，就很少保得住了。今世不乏由貧賤而發跡之人，雖不必學三巨家家堂裏的陳設，但不忘本三字，却當製個匾額，懸諸中堂，以示子孫的。</p>
<h3>摩登女郞</h3>
<p>— 秋子</p>
<p>友人自濟南來，為道濟南市街，近有摩登女郎，裝束入時，旗其袍，肉色其襪，遠望之飄飄欲仙。細認之，肉色而已矣，襪則未之有也。蓋彼等異想天開，倩人於玉腿上畫作肉色襪形，絲紋畢現，儼然絲襪，幾可亂眞，且光澤有過之無不可及。代價則為每畫一次，國幣八羊，畫就之後，忌洗操，不然，洗盡鉛華，又回復本來而目（面目二字應換大腿為妥）。其足趾則渲染荳蔻，極為鮮艶，兩大趾趾甲上面，復畫有靑天白日，事之離奇，幾無出其右者。</p>
<p>本來天氣熱，裸足可也，充其量不過襪商叫苦而已。今裸則裸矣，仍須塗脂抹粉，假裝絲襪，究何為者？每晝一次，國幣八羊，以每月三次計，至少須二十四羊，較之購穿絲襪，孰貴孰賤？如謂有的是錢鈔，則嗷嗷待哺之災黎，儘可多捐一元半元，是救人一命，豈止勝坐七級浮屠而已哉？奈何計不出此，反在大足趾上畫靑天白日，以為非此不足以盡摩登之能事，寗非咄咄怪事？</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第二十回　掙命看嬌孫抱頭落淚荒年憶往事種麥招殃</p>
<p>我爹因為白天打水，總要和人家你搶我奪，而且也打不了多少水，我爹他又變了一個法子，就是白天讓人去打水，到了半夜裏，大家都睡了，他就從從容容去動手。由四月到六月，我們的麥長得很好。我們估計，可以打五六百斤。別家種的麥，雖是比我們澆水要晚一點，但是也有些收成，全堡子裏靠了這兩口井，總是和什麼地方都要好些的。周太太道：我雖不明白你們西北的事，但是南方的莊稼，我是知道的，莊稼最苦的事，是靑黃不接，你們　種的麥子，雖是長得很好，可沒有收割到家。據你說吃的糧食，早就搭了草根在裏面了。這又過了幾個月了，你們都吃着什麼呢？月英道：你問的很對，我們雖是種了有幾百斤麥，也只是眼睛裏看得好過，肚子裏可是一天比一天難受。糧食呢，有錢的人家，或者還有些，像我們這樣窮人家，借也借不到，買也買不起，只有多多的吃些草根。這也可以說是一分氣力一分財，因為我們麥地裏，常是不斷水，野草長得也不少，我們就把這野草弄了回來，用水煮着吃。那草讓我們拕去了一回，地上又長了出來一叢，就這樣煮野草吃，過了兩個月。（二四九）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>說到這個妖字，那園了的聲音已沙啞得幾乎聽不消楚了。</p>
<p>李蓮英問明了這事的原委，也立卽感覺到噦躇起來，他就默默地盤算着：因為他已經相信那園丁的話是對的了，在深秋的時候，孤另另地開出一朶玉蘭花來，的確是一種不祥的妖異；可是他又知道太后是一個迷信最深的人，平時那樣的注意着選吉日，挑吉時，恨不得處處看見喜字壽字，時時聽到祝文或頌語，像這樣顯然預示不祥的消息傳去給伊聽了，眞不知要引起伊多少的煩惱咧！於是輪到李蓮英自己彈琵琶了：然而他畢竟是一個富於手段的老好巨滑，稍稍躊躇了一會，便已胸有成竹了。</p>
<p>「旣是眞有這樣的奇事，我當然要給你轉奏老佛爺的」！他向那園丁說道：「此刻沒有你的事了，快回去小心侍候着吧！待太后要問你，我再派人來傳喚就是啦！」</p>
<p>這遠是早上八九點鐘咧！太后還在梳裝更衣，快要準備出去上朝了，我也在一旁隨侍着，突然李蓮英怱忽地走進來了，我們這許多人便一齊旋過頭去，將我們的視綫集中在他的臉上。（四四五）</p>
<h3>鴟梟</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>早上起來，聽見那烏鴉在頭上啞啞的叫幾聲，一定要吐他一口唾沫，還要咒駡它幾聲。其實烏鴉也生了嘴，怎能禁止它不叫：不過它叫得難聽一些，對於人們也沒有甚麼不利市，何苦去咒罵它。這是烏鴉的不幸咧！鳥類中和烏鴉同命運的要算鴟梟了，它在月黑夜深的時候，發出一陣悽慘的叫聲，也同樣的使人憎惡和厭忌。</p>
<p>鴟梟的形式，生得眼睜臉圓，和貓面差不多，所以俗叫做「貓頭鷹」。而且生性兇猛，晝伏夜出，喜食同類，人們又加一重憎惡。它叫時先一頓一挫好像在說「扛出！扛出！」接着便長啼婉轉，好像。鈴聲一般，所以鄉人又叫它做「搖鈴烏」，照從前迷信的傳說：「凡是它悲啼了一陣，里巷內一定要有死喪的事情發生」。所以逢風高月黑午夜夢回的時候，聽見它叫聲，一定要使人毛骨聳然，疑心那不祥的事便會發生。因了這種傳說，我在小時也上了人一次的當。因為有人和我說：「它在叫着扛出！扛出！一定是在說着某人死亡，只要你把耳朶伏在甏口，便能聽得明白說那一人死亡了」。我給好奇心所驅使，費了一宵的不眠，逞它叫時，趕緊伏耳甏口，一探它所叫的秘密，結果當然是失敗。</p>
<p>它的窠又喜歡做在那高大的銀杏樹頂。那高大的銀杏樹，是里巷神話的發生處，甚麼雷劈蛇精咧甚麼樹神顯形咧！人們自然會加以附會。它竟擇此而棲，怎怪人們不視它為一種不祥而又神秘的鳥兒呢！</p>
<p>遊踪所至</p>
<h3>秋季中之吳山</h3>
<p>— 朱</p>
<p>流光如駛，轉眼已秋光漸老：藝打盧白，菊黃蟹肥，早已滿眼秋景。在這季節節裏，嘉興的鴛鴦湖，當然是名勝所在，烟雨樓頭，一片烟景，大足使人留連。蘇州在這秋季裏，當然也有不少名勝所在，可供遊覽，寫在下面，以當識途老馬。</p>
<p>天平紅葉　天平山麓，有范仲淹先生的祖墓，那裏山石駢列，像萬芴朝天，一名賢勝跡，為名山點綴着雄器風光。</p>
<p>天平山麓遍地楓樹，在這秋光漸老的當兒，那楓葉漸變鮮紅，一片紅光，雲蒸霞蔚，彷彿滿樹桃杏：確含着無限的詩情與畫意！天平山，在蘇城西首，從木凟量范路過去，約有五六里路：近來蘇木公路通了汽車，往返是很便捷的。</p>
<p>鄧尉桂花　光福鎭鎮的鄧尉山，那裏的梅花，是很有名的。在春到人間當兒，那光福山麓，漫山遍野！全是梅花，開得香雪成海。然而秋天桂花那種繁榮的概况，却也不下於春天的梅花，到桂花開放的時季，輪船駛停碼頭，那桂花的濃郁的香氣，早已撲入艙中。光福的桂花，自虎山頭起，澗溪窰上，各處村落，眞開得遍地黃金極患煊爛。那種桂花，蘇州糖果店和糕餅店畏，都派着人前往收買，一年中也有幾千元出產，是那裏農產物的副品。光福地址較遠，然而那條蘇福公路已在加緊趕築，在不久的將來，公路完成後，交通上就要便利多多宜於遊玩了。</p>
<p>南塘菱波　蘇州是水雲鄕。在葑門城外的黃天蕩中淸波一片，荷香十里，不但是夏季的勝地：就是到了秋天，那青靑的菱兒，早都長大成熟，生吃楚嫩嫩的鮮美可口，煮熟以後，十分香糯。那菱葉是靑靑的浮在水上，有如碧玉，微風起處，菱波就隨風動盪，微起波蘭：點綴着採菱的鄉村兒女，那種曼妙的境界，眞像到了盡圖裏面。</p>
<p>石湖蘆花　上方山麓的石湖裏，藘花到處皆是，在這秋光老去當兒，那蘆梗上都放淸白化，一片銀光，點綴在蒼翠的蘆葦中，雄奇恣肆，眞是別有風光。湖中的藏枼，每年價值約千元左右，除了當薪柴外，還可做冥用器具的骨骼，和製掃帚等等各種用品。</p>
<p>洞庭秋光　在秋高氣爽的當兒，渺渺湖波，靜碧若鏡，太湖的浩瀚嫵媚，真也不下於西子湖頭，東西洞庭兩山，分峙湖內，東洞庭山，周圍五十餘里，登莫釐峯頂，全湖景色，盡收眼底，七十二峯，歷歷可數，點缀着幾葉歸帆。那種景色，充滿着畫意詩情，使人不忍離去。西洞庭山，諸峯環抱，十分雄奇；縹緲峯頭，高踞全山，那產碧螺春名茶的碧羅峯，就在縹緲峯側。洞庭山除東山產枇杷。西山產楊梅以外，秋天的石榴，實大知碗，粒粒紅子，好似紅寶石一般味兒也十分甜美。洞庭景色，是挺美的，可惜交通上不很便利，未免美中不足</p>

<h3>出版界應走那條路？</h3>
<p>— 玉輝</p>
<p>在本刊二十七期上冷峯先生的「出版界應有的覺悟」一文中，指出了目前出版界兩條十分顯著的趨勢，一條是大家努力於古書的翻印，一條是大家競出肉感的，色情的畫刊。大體上說，冷峯先生說的並沒有錯。在財力梢為富有，規模稍為大一點的書店，現在大都正在致力於古籍的翻印與整理；規模小，財力弱的書店却在競出畫刊同一些內容空洞，徒籍形式的美觀來招引顧客的雜誌。這種現象很使一般有識的人代中國文化的前途抱悲觀。不過我以為這悲觀是可以不必的，因為這是一種不可避免的趨勢。為什麼呢？由於員前出版界這種畸形的現象，我們不是可以淸楚地看出一般讀者購買力的薄弱麼？幾千本，少至幾十本，十幾本的叢書或叢刋之類是什麼樣的顧客是不必說了，買畫報同內容淺薄的刊物是什麼樣的讀者，我想讀者亦大都可以想到。前者的主顧是一些學者，藏夀家，同圖書館，後者無疑是一些有點閒錢的大學生或是公子哥兒們，他們想藉此來消磨飯前舞後的餘閒。目前出版界最好的主顧旣是道一類人，而書店雖然說漂亮點是宣傳文化，但我們不能呌他們作虧本的生意，呌他們出版一些找不到顧客，或只合一般無力購買書籍雜誌的人們的興趣與需要的書。所以眼前出版界所顯示出來的兩條路實是必然的。有心中國文化前途的人，我以為不應對這現象抱悲觀，相反地，我們應代出版界籌想一些較為有效的辦法，使書店不妨碍他們的生意經，在讀者方面又可以得點實益。徒然悲觀，徒然咀咒出版界當局的錯誤是沒有什麼裨益的。</p>
<p>我們旣然看出一般的購買力的薄弱，但我們却不能否認一般讀者求知慾的增加。他們倘若有一點餘錢的話，除開一些的確為他們所迫切需要的書物之外，他們絕不亂化，更不會買一些用來消閑的東西，因為他們根本就無閑可言。所以我們如果能够出版一些較為實用，換句話說，較為合於一般讀者的電要的書籍與雜誌時，我們確信還有相當的銷路，止要定價不十分昂貴。</p>
<p>現在是最大多數人都在鬧着經濟恐慌的時代。能够買得起十幾元，幾十元以至幾百元一部書的千人中不得一，但這並不是說一般讀者不需要讀書。所以我們出版界除讓那些大規模的公司去出版大部書外，小規模的書店應盡力出版一些小型的東西。我們不能以其型小而加鄙視，只要辦得精采，那麼，雖小又何妨？况且今日能有讀書時間的人少，能得充分時間讀書的人更少，大都是在工餘，在課餘，分出一點時間來的，那麼我們出版小型的便於購買，便於閱讀的雜誌同書籍，實在是最適合不過的。</p>
<p>購到辦雜誌。許多人咀咒中國眼前雜誌的充斥，在我却不以為然，我們現有所有的那些雜誌，好的並不多，其餘的盡是些廢料，只是白紙印上黑字，內容的空洞，宗旨的欠純正，選取的失重心，作品的粗淺，人云亦云，在在都使人覺得無聊，請問有多少雜誌能超過二千份以上？它們是不是只徒然地在書市塲上佔一個空隙，讓購主嗤之以鼻而巳？那麼，要是冉辦一個有意義的雜誌，我們還可以嫌多麼？而目雜誌是綜合的，新鮮的，辦者輕而易舉（是較那些大部的書容易的意思，要辦得好還是很難的），讀者亦便於選購，易於閱讀，而且對於新發生的事情，立刻可以抓住來發揮，闡說，這是單行本所不及的。那麼再進一步，我們要什麼內容的雜誌呢？關於國內外的政治，經濟，外交情勢的雜誌，我們現在還有一些，我們要注意科學方面的，如社會科學，理化等等。可是主要的條件就是文章要顧及讀者的程度，不要令人讀了頭痛，要用一種流暢的，明瞭的文章寫出來，即時下所謂科學小品。作者在那里只是作一種啟蒙的工作，領導讀者走到一條正確的路逕上去，然後山他們自己去被現，去開拓他們自己未來的園地。</p>
<p>還有幾種意見再寫在下面：</p>
<p>我們現在的出版界——尤其新聞界已把眼光由小數人移到多數人上來了。這是可喜的一件事。我以為我們目前，無妨試辦一種新型的新聞紙，但本質上雖與新聞紙略同，可是他又兼什誌的長處，即是於記載事實之後，更擇要的加以說明。我以為讀報是日常一件大事，而報又是一件最難讀的東西，有十分的修養的人看懂十分，無修養的人看了却捉摸不到什麼，等於不看。在文化的立塲上說，這種出版物每日給予讀者一點智識，積至一年，亦能蔚然可觀了。人們的學識，純粹是在不知不覺，日積月累之中得來的極而且我相信它必有極大的銷路。因為讀者可以由大學生（因為他們的學識好些都是空空如也）直到店員與黃包車夫。</p>
<p>其次是以什誌的性質來獲得專門的效果。例如我們以日本的研究作中心，每十日，或每半月出一冊，介紹日本的國情或日本的國勢的動向等等。主要的是純粹以日本作中心（譬如中日關係，蘇日關係的討論亦可包括在內），讓讀者以讀什誌的能力與時間及精神獲得一些專門的智識。</p>
<p>還有，我們儘可以迎合各單位的讀者而辦各種類的出版物，如以大中學生為中心，目前最要緊的莫過於工具一類的東西，如外國語是。北平「日文與日語」定價甚昂，但每期銷路很好，而且銷售範團僅局限於華北一帶。由此可見這類工具刋物在讀者需求之殷與出版者眼光之正確。此外如法文·德文·俄文等等都是可以舉辦的。我們文化落後，正需要向外國去學習，現在外國文對我們是極端需要的。以英文而論，商務中華二家所出之英語週刋，雖然非常枯燥，亦擁有萬上的讀者。如果我們的出版家願意生財而又作一點有貢獻於中國文化的事業的話，這就是一條富有意義的生財大道了。外如針對兒童，針對婦女等等都有舉辦各類什誌的必要。</p>
<p>綜上所言，我的意見完全是對小規棹的出版機關說明的，而且亦是由下的意旨歸納來的；我們自五四到現在，文化的收獲依然非常貧之，大學生而不曉得阿比西尼亞，以為哈爾濱是俄國境內的地名的豈非比比皆趁？我們需要再來一次啟蒙的工作。這一面的啟蒙工作的對象不應局限於智識階級與上層份子，而應普及到全體的民衆上去。所以我贊成辦什誌，辦新型的新聞刋物，辦收獲專門的效果的刊物。</p>
<p>我們出版界向來都是一面價的。看見甲出幽默的刊物獲利，於是乙亦出版幽默文集，丙亦出版幽默名作選。看見人家出課本，於是亦爭着出版課本。但獲得利益的只有最初發動那一家，其餘不是虧本便是把它一拆九扣，當作廢紙出賣。精明的出版家們為什麼不去發見開拓自己的新大陸呢？</p>
<p>還有定價的問題，我以為應當低廉，什誌的獲得興否並不在定價上，而是在獲得讀者的多少上。紐約的（Sarurr＇ay　Evering　Post）一本只買五分錢，簡直連一半紙錢都補不上，但赫斯特（S　Harst）每年却因而獲得幾千萬美金的利益。原因就是它的讀者衆多，另一方面收入了許多廣告費的緣故。而廣告的多少又是看讀者的多少而定的。出版家最初怕虧本，於是儘量把定價提高。殊不知提高定價正是出版家一種自殺。</p>
<p>我的意思止於此，由目前新聞界的什誌化，什誌的新聞化看來，我這些推測或不至於怎樣錯誤罷。</p>
<h3>談書報介紹</h3>
<p>— 冷峯</p>
<p>每種的刊物上，大都附有「書報介紹」的一欄，將出版界之出版物，一一為之評價，使讀者依着這評定之價值，作為購買書籍之參考，這是再好也沒有的事。因為，出版界的出版物，大批的增加，商務日出新書二三種，其他的書店，每月所出也有三四種十數種不等，一個月之新出版物，眞可以汗牛而充梀，而這汗牛充棟的出版物中，自然良莠不齊，設非有人來為之立出標準，一一評價，則購買的讀者，免不掉買了不少的莠書，耗費着有用的金錢，寶貴的光陰，實在太不合算。所以，「書報介紹」，雖然在每種刊物上所處的地位是附屬的地位，然而要緊，也就不言可知了。</p>
<p>書報介紹的作者，他所負使命很大，他站在批評家的地位，指導看著作家應走的途徑；他握住了出版界賺錢蝕本的樞紐，做着文化列車的司機者，指示着出版界應走的方向。所以，書報介紹的作者，不是張三李四任何人能够勝任的工作。因為他必須明白社會的情形，時代的趨勢，出版物詳細的內容，更用不偏的忠誠的客觀的態度，作懇切的介紹，使讀者讀了他的文字，能够知道一本書的確切的好壞；使著作家讀了他的文字，明白自己著作的缺點而有所改進；使出版界讀了他的文字，明白出版界自己對於文化是否有貢獻。一個書報介紹的作者，他所寫的文字，如果能够完全達到這一個地步，那可以說他所寫的文字，眞是字字珠璣了。然而現在一般書報介紹的作者怎麼樣，不是去着這一個期望很遠嗎？</p>
<p>現在書報介紹的作者，不是和著作家有着親戚友誼的關係，便是和出版界有着金錢的關係，所以他所作的介紹文字，大都說了些滑頭的敷衍話，對於出版物毫無痛癢之關係。他做介紹文章之先，也不化一些精力把出版物從頭到底詳細地看一下，最多看看目錄，看看序文，把出版物的頭尾大略地看了一下。因為他們不是忠誠地寫介紹文章，所以對出版物無細看之必要；因為他們對出版物並不細看，所以所寫的文字，不痛不癢滑頭的敷衍了一回算了。這種的介紹文字，有等於無，徒然弄汚了幾張白紙，對於文化界是根本沒有利益的。所以現在一般書報介紹的文章，弄得沒有人過目、雖然內中也有一二篇是有價值的文章，但因金砂混入砂土之中，也就不為一般人所注意了。</p>
<p>每一種也版物，要說其完全無缺，似乎很少很少，這等於絕世美人，面上不免有一個疤痕或是有一粒黑痣。現在，我們翻翻書報介紹的文章，十有九是稱述該出版物是良好的。明明筆忠實」；明明作者的文字艱澀得很，而介紹文字總是說其「文筆流利」。這樣的書報介紹的作者，無異為人介紹婚姻的舊式的媒婆，憑其三寸不爛之舌，花言巧語，把一個黑皮麻姑娘，形容得如天人再世，令人目迷神眩。人家信了他的介紹，上了一兩次的當，以後冉也不會上當，所以現在書業不景氣之中，而書報介紹的文字由你把一本書吹噓得怎麼的優良，因為讀者對於介紹文字失去了信仰，再也引不起購買的熱忱。有許多出版商人，明白到這一點，所以新書出版，廣告文字祇說該書大概的內容，不把該書加以過分的褒獎。是的，今後書報介紹的文字，把一本出版物一味恭維是不對的，必須要改革一下，不要抱了為著作人和出版界謀銷路之廣寬而做介紹文字，必須為讀者購買書籍不上當而做介紹文字；換句話說，介紹文字之作者，要站立在讀者方面才對，不要站立到著作家和出版界方面去。我很希望執筆寫書報介紹的文字的先生們，能够有悟於這一點，這不僅是單純的讀者之幸，乃是整倘文化前途之幸！</p>
<h3>讀「元曲槪論」</h3>
<p>— 沈聖時</p>
<p>商務版，賀昌羣著，價四角</p>
<p>這是一本薄薄的研究元曲的論著，把它讀完後，覺到前四章，作者從史方面探討元曲的淵源，似很用點苦心的，這些在其他研究元曲的書上，很少見到，作者的自序上也說：「…不過著者自信從外國樂舞而探究宋元戲曲的淵源，此書於這方面，雖未能很滿意，可還是王先生國維及現時多數研究宋元戲曲者所未嘗道及的…」</p>
<p>不過我想從史方面的探討和叙述，把它放在「元曲概論」裏，似乎有一點不甚相宜，在一本「文學概論」裏不能講到文學史。在一本「小說原理」或是「詩歌原理」裏，也不應把史的部分混進去，不過這種誤混情形是常見的。</p>
<p>這本「元曲概論」裏，旣有史方面的探討叙述，又包括「作法」與「作家」等，如果把書名題作「元曲研究」而能再增以一點材料，在讀者方面也許可以更覺滿意一點。</p>
<p>本書第七章是「元曲的作家」，應不應放進「概論一裏去，且不再提；雖然是概論，似乎叙述散曲的部分太簡，簡直尋不出一點兒來，說到小令，僅有「元人擅此者以張小山最為名家」一句，並且還寫了張可久的號，要是不熟悉小山即張可久的號，看起來又多點不方便。</p>
<p>一百三十二頁關漢卿一節下，說關今存十三種劇，應作十四種，尚遺漏竣大尹智勘緋衣夢一篇。</p>
<p>一百四十一頁，白樸一節下，說白樸所作雜劇有十六種，今存二種，查其他文學史多作十五種。想或者把金鳳欽一篇也列在雜劇裏，因為這篇金鳳欽在元孫季昌的集雜劇名詠情及明沈伯英的集雜劇名裏均列入這個雜劇名。近見趙景深有白樸的金鳳釵一篇考證文，考證它並非雜劇，（該文發表於自由談），或者不是金鳳釵而另外一篇雜劇，因為我沒有見過，不敢隨便瞎說。</p>
<p>此外，尚仲賢所作劇今知有十一種　，本書只作十種、秦簡夫作劇今知有五種　，今存兩種本書只作有劇四種。又喬吉（一作喬吉甫）有劇十一種，今傳三種，本書謂著劇八種，其他未得一一檢查，似尚有遺漏也。</p>

<h3>戒烟調理問題</h3>
<p>— 賈治中醫師</p>
<p>習慣於人。有積重難返之勢。而尤以烟癮戒除為尤難。蓋吸者平時吞吐慣常。非此不足以振提精神。一旦被時勢所迫。不得已而求戒。自必百病雜呈。痛苦不堪。因之調理之法。為戒烟者所不可不注意也。</p>
<p>戒烟者史福棠君。烟癮甚深。觔月因亟求戒除起見。投院戒烟。無如頭痛失眠便秘胃呆等症。紛起雜乘。於是藥石頻投。窮於應付。後由尚立文君介紹來余處。余診得史君因戒烟而生活變化。內分泌亦失常。致多疾病。遂囑其服用生殖素以資調理。迄今月餘。未現一症。而精神較之吸烟期間。更覺淸健愉快云。</p>

<h3>本校建築新校舍之經過</h3>
<p>校長盧頌虔謹述</p>
<p>在此國家多難，社會凋敝之時期中，本校新校舍第一期工程竟已完成矣。第一期工程之所以能完成者，直接為熱心敎育之同鄉父老贊助之力，問接則為社會各界提撕鼓舞之功，故能於萬難之環境中，達到預期之目的。斯則本校同人為吾粵旅滬同鄉子弟所銘感無旣者。當茲初期工程告竣，新校舍舉行開幕之際，對於筆路襤褸之往迹，誠不可以無記。現為說明之便利計，將經過大略，由民國十九年起至民國二十四年八月止，分為五個時期，謹述之如次：</p>
<p>（一）醞釀時期——十九年一月至十二月</p>
<p>近年來吾粵旅滬人數因本市政治，經濟，商業，工業等之進展，日漸增多，約在二十萬以上。照人口總數與學齡兒童之比率為百分之十五計算，應有三萬餘人。此三萬餘應受敎育之兒童，以年齡，言語，習慣，種菰方便之故，其擇校之標準，多屬於同鄉所設立者。故年來吾粵旅滬學校，日見發達，本校原有校舍，祇可容納六百人，亦不能不逾量容納至千餘人，雖擁擠已甚，而要求入校者，尚實繁有徒。蓋當時本校巳有十八年之歷史，同鄉父老劉於本校屬望　殷，且頻頻以擴充學額，添辦高中相期。計當時以書面聲述此項意見者，共一百二十人，（原函見本校前出版刊物木棉第六期中）其中口頭聲述者，不可勝數。本校同人謀副同鄉父老之期望，即擬籌欵別營新址，議甫定，猶未向外界宣佈，而熱心敎育事業之同鄉老燕林先生微聞之，即慨然齊千元至，曰：「略為經營新舍之助。」其見義勇為之熱誠，使本校同人至為感奮。於是徵求各方面意見，準備積極進行，並編印擴充計劃特刋，說明建築新校舍之旨趣；更列舉楊斯盛，　澄衷，馮平山，陳嘉庚諸先輩捐資興學之事蹟，以告世之留心敎育者。自本校擴充計劃發表以來，同鄉人士無不同聲贊助，廣肇公所董事溫欽甫先生等，學生家長林毅伯先生等，更予以有力之指導，策勵其進行。</p>
<p>（二）萌芽時期——二十年一月至十二月</p>
<p>本校於擴充計劃發表之後，曾於一十年一月舉行藝術成績展覽會，邀請同鄉及各界參觀。蓋欲以本校學生之作業成績呈獻於平日關心本校狀况諸先進之前，冀得其批評指導，并扶助本校擴充計劃之實行也。其時廣肇公所董事唐少川，陳炳謙，溫欽甫諸先生暨徐峙崧先生等蒞校參觀，均認為滿意。陳炳謙先生對於本校擴充計劃尤極力贊成，慨然負責主持其事。即約頌虔同往江灣區水電路選擇新校地基；目嘗為地基事蒞校商榷，宏謀卓識，指示實多。本校同人得陳先生之策勵，益為奮發。在此期間頌虔與李錦沛建築師及各敎職員幾度察看新校舍地址，并數往參觀本市中外各學校之新建築，以為借鏡之資。是年春間，陳炳謙先生即着手為本校選購新校地，綢繆擘晝，煞費苦心，更得楊潤之，崔聘西諸先生協助一切，進行甚迅。惟校舍地基須為相連之地，驟行購置，殊非易事，蓋地主不一，不肯出售者有之，故意居奇者有之，情形複雜，辦理困難，知非仰藉政府之力不為功。爰於本年八月間呈請上海市政府咨內政部准予依法徵收民地。但手續繁重，非一時所能辦竣。於是一面向政府呈請，一面段法開始募捐，以期雙方並進，早觀厥成。校董唐寳書先生特具熱誠，曾預向許文亮先生募得二萬元，約定於實行建築之相當時期中，即行繳交。熱心敎育，至足感也。</p>
<p>（三）頓停時期—二十一年一月至五月</p>
<p>自二十年九一八事件發生以後，因國難嚴重，人心不寗，益以一二八之變，本市首當其衝，百業凋零，民生憔悴，本校適丁斯厄，擴充計劃，遂致無形停頓。然敎育救國實為要圖，同人等夙夜經營固未嘗，一日稍弛責任也。</p>
<p>（四）實現時期—二十一年六月至二十三年五月二十一年六月二十四日廣肇公所董事會議，董事唐寳書先生以本校建築新校舍旣具相當某礎，爰提議由公所撥欵四萬元為建築費，以促其成，董事溫欽甫先生和議，一致贊成通過。本校擴充計劃至是益趨實現。七月千一日廣肇公所溫欽甫先生等函請吳鐵城市長担任本校建築校舍募捐委員長，慨蒙允諾，並引為己任。復聘請熱心敎育之同鄉為幕捐委員會委員，并推舉唐少川，孫哲生兩先生為名譽委員長。其後更公推陳炳謙，郭噸兩先生為募捐委員會副委員長，協同正委員長主持會務，均承俞允。七月二十七日吳委員長召集第一次會議於廣肇公所，到會者異常踴躍，對於會務進行，曾有詳盡之討論。并盯定募捐委員會章程呈報敎育局轉呈市政府批准備案。為辦事便利起見，分設：教育設計委員會，由溫欽甫先生任主席；建築委員會，由郭樂先生任主席；財政委員會，由陳炳謙先生任主席；購地委員會，由郭順先生任主席。并推舉李大超，唐寶書，馮炳南，周淸泉，崔聘西，勞敬修，楊梅南，楊潤之，黎照寰，黃煥南，譚蓉圃，蔡昌，司徒尚桑諸先生為常務委員，復推舉頌虔為總幹事。各有職司，分負責任，羣策羣力，自無難相與有成也。委員長曁各委員均異常熱心，進行募捐，不遺餘力。本校亦曾編印廣肇中學成績一斑分贈各同鄉，以為募捐之助。十月二十日吳委員長約同郭順，馮炳南兩先生親到鄭伯昭先生處勸捐，當蒙鄭先生慨允助捐五萬元。本校得此鉅欵，裨益進行，殊非淺鮮。各同鄉亦皆當仁不讓，踴躍輸將。永安公司曁永安紡織公司各捐一萬元，二十二年一月復承廣東省政府補助一萬元，募捐委昌會决定捐額五十萬元，至是巳將籌及半數，各同鄉熱心興學，至足欽敬！當募捐委員會第一次全體會議時，議决校址除陳炳謙先生以陳燕燦名義捐助十八畝外，添購三十二畝，共成五十畝。至舉行第三次全體會議時，對於校基方面，僉以為實施生產敎育及便於將來再謀擴充計，須設法廣購校地，議决增購校地一百五十畝，共成二百畝。隨即擬就計劃及各項圖說，呈送土地敎育兩局核呈市政府，咨請內政部准予依法徵收，以備建築之用。嗣經土地敎育兩局幾度詳細考查，始准予轉呈核辦，直至二十二年八月十八日乃得內政部完全批准。可見政府對於人民團體呈請圈購民地，辦理異常愼重也。本校圈購民地旣得核准，即向土地所有人接洽收買，陳炳謙先生受大會委託，負責辦理此事，復得李大超先生之協助，進行頗為順利。（關於圈購民地之經過，詳見本校新校舍奠基特刊第二十一頁）陳先生又為學生往來便利計，與溫欽甫，郭順兩先生聯名呈請市政府在虹口公園游泳池斜對面，開築馬路（即閘北道路茶統內之通利路）直達本校新校址。旋奉市政府批准，由本校祖任展築工程費六千七百元，收用土地費由市庫支付。并呈准市政府將該路定名為廣中路（即廣肇中學路）以資紀念。（關於開築廣中路之經過，詳見本校新校舍奠基特刊第二十四貢）。</p>
<p>廿二年十一月二十日陳日平會計師允任募捐委員會義務查賬員，負責稽核進支欵項。隨即編印廿一年十月至廿三年三月廿六日收支賬略分發捐欵人及經募人查閱，并摘要送登各報廣告，以昭信實。</p>
<p>（五）第一期完成時期廿—三年六月至廿四年八月</p>
<p>校地旣巳購定，即從事興工建築，廿三年六月，由李錦沛，范文照，關頌聲（朱彬代）三建築師，聯合繪就校舍圖樣，繼即招標承建。投標者共二十家，標價最高者十八萬九千零廿四元，最低者十二萬一千四百五十元，結果交與光華營造廠承辦，計造便十二萬五千元。七月廿六日，工務局核發營造執照，即日正式興工，聘定文學　君為監工。九月九日舉行奠基　禮，同鄉及各界到塲觀禮者千餘人，吳委員長親奠基石，并致吉詞。復以本校為旅滬粤人設立規模最大之學校；所負使命，異常重大，有賴於各同鄉努力合作者至多，故於致吉詞後，繼以極誠懇極扼要之演說，聽者異常感動。當時編印奠基紀念特刋，詳述籌備建築校舍之經過，及此後進行之計劃。附錄捐欵佈告，裝釘成册，分贈各同鄉及各界，以資宣傳。旋蒙林炳炎先生捐助六萬元，簡照南夫人由陳炳謙先生勸募捐助五萬元。炳炎先生以本校設立，原以栽培同鄉子弟，一視同仁，惟原名廣肇中學，未免因地方之名義，而畛域微分。爰提議更改校名，以期名符其實。廿四年一月十日，募捐委員會開第十次全體會議，議决校名改稱粵東中學，一月十九日登報公告，易稱今名。本校艱難締造，賴各同鄉及各界熱心贊助，纔建立今日之規模，其盛德豐功，白當永留紀念。校中大運動塲一區命名炳炎運動塲，所以紀念林炳炎先生也，塲前建一亭作來賓看臺及運動員休息之所。禮堂及辦公廳一座，命名照甫堂，所以紀念簡照南先生也。斯堂原定為陳炳謙先生太翁星朗公紀念堂，乃因陳先生以讓為德，願移以紀念簡公，而本校將別建圖書館以紀念星朗公焉。敎室全座，命名伯昭樓，所以紀念鄭伯昭先生也。體育館一座，命名許母體育館，所以紀念許文亮先生之太夫人也。宿舍一座，命名永安樓，所以紀念永安公司及永安紡織公司也。紀念碑一座，建立於校內適宜地點，碑成立方形，計分四面，一面為吳委員長紀念碑，一面為陳炳謙先生紀念碑，一面為郭樂，郭順兩先生紀念碑，一面為林炳炎先生紀念碑（碑文另錄）。又查中外各市，有以路名紀念有功動者，本校校內士敏土路，寬大整潔，樹茂交陰，今命名曰少川路，哲生路，欽甫路，寗書路，大超路，炳南路，聘西路，煥南路，偉夫路，潤之路，照寰路，所以紀念唐少川，孫哲生，溫欽甫，唐書書，李大超，馮炳南，崔聘西，黃煥南，蔡昌，（偉夫）楊潤之，黎照衰等先生者也。至各踝室為講習之所，學生對之印象尤深，故以各間課室為諸先生之紀念室，計有耀廷室，敬修室，梅南室，毅伯室，燕林室，淸泉室，鴻鈞室，蓉圃室，尚桑室，以誠室，峙崧室，日平室，所以紀念胡耀延，勞敬修，楊梅南，林毅伯，老燕林，周淸泉，俞鴻鈞譚蓉圃，司徒尚桑，鄧以誠，徐峙崧，陳日平等先生者也。此外捐欵各先生，另照本校規定紀念捐欵者辦法，分別敬謹紀念。蓋崇德報功，以昭激勸，禮也，亦衆志也，本校第一期建築工程，其大部分業於二十四年二月中完成，中學全部即行遷入。開學之日，吳委員長及各校董均蒞校舉行典禮，親致調詞。師生濟濟一堂，頗稱一時之盛。至八月第一期工程完全告竣，定於十月二十六日舉行落成典禮。截至二十四年八月底止收進捐欵共計三十六萬七千二百三十一元五角五分。捐欵諸君台銜及收支賬目，另刊入新校舍落成紀念册中，茲從略。</p>
<h3>本校沿革</h3>
<p>本報成立於民國二年一月，為現任校長盧頌虔先生所創辦。其時祇設小學部，賃北四川路淸雲里普通民房為校舍，名曰培德學校。六年八月先後呈准上海縣署及滬海道尹公署立案。八年二月添設中學部曁幼穉園。十年一月因經費支絀，暫行停辦中學部。</p>
<p>十一年一月起，改　上海廣肇公所設立，並改校名為上海廣肇公學。十二年九月遷入北四川路橫浜橋堍福德星自建之校舍內，除小學部繼續擴充外，同時并恢復中學部舉辦初級中學。十七年二月呈准上海特別市敎育局立案。十八年八月遵市敎宵局令改稱上海特別市私立廣肇中小學，十九年三月復遵令改稱上海市私立廣肇初級中學，而將小學部改為附屬小學，（即現在之廣公第一小學）二十年六月奉准國民政府敎育部備案。二十一年因一二八之役，學生家屬多移居滬西，本校為免礙學生學業起見，即於特區西摩路新閘路口賃屋開學，事平遷回原校上課、同時因近年學生激增，小學部尤為擁擠，爰將西摩路之臨時校舍，增設第二附屬小學。（即現在之廣公第二小學）</p>
<p>二十一年七月籌建中學部新校舍，組織募捐委員會主持其事。二十二年八月呈准國民政府內政部在閘北水電路圈購民地二百畝為校址。二十三年七月興工建樂。同年十二月呈准市敎育局添辦高級中學。二十四年一月經本校建築校舍募捐委員會之决議，改稱上海粤東中學，並於同年二月呈請市敎育局轉呈敎育部批准備案，改稱今名。同年二月中旬新校舍第一期工程完竣，隨即遷入新校舍上課。</p>
<p>所有原有北四川路福德里之新校舍，即完全作為廣公第一小學暨幼稚園之用。</p>
<h3>本校將來計劃</h3>
<p>本校第一期建築計劃，雖告完成，但今後之有待舉辦者，萬緒千端，至難盡述，今摘其較重要者列舉於後：</p>
<p>一·籌募本校基金。學校基金，最關重要。本校於第一期建築計劃告成，即須注意及此。現正着手組織本校籌募基金委員會，負責進行。（辦法另詳）</p>
<p>二·增設職業科目。本校為實施生產敎育起見，斟酌實際需要，分期增設職業科目。由廿四年度第二學期起，先開辦商科，以次舉辦工科農科等。</p>
<p>三·分期添設校舍。本校總地圖所列大小建築物，不下二十座。現已建築完成者：計有禮堂及辦公樓一座，敎堂一座，體育館一座，宿舍一座，膳堂一座，廚房及工人室一座，傳達室及警衛室各一座，紀念亭及紀念碑各一座，大運動塲一，小運動塲二，士敏士路十一。現正開工建築者：計有圖書館一座。即將建築者：計有宿舍一座。此外尚有敎室三座，宿舍二座，工廠二座，游泳池一，運動塲看台二，再酌定分期建築，以完成全部計劃。</p>
<p>四·繼續購置校基。本校呈准圈購之地，共有二百零八畝九分六厘二亳。今巳購入者，僅一百零九畝五分三厘二亳。餘數當陸續購入，以應需用。</p>
<p>五·建築敎職員新邨。本校擬劃出校基一部份，建築敎職員新邨，以解决敎職員住的問題。（辦法另詳）</p>
<p>六·添辦廣公第三小學。本校附近，日漸繁盛，粵籍同鄉卜居於此者，實繁有徒，以後想更有加無巳。本校為利便兒童就學起見，擬於相當時期，在本校鄰近添辦廣公第三小學。（本校附設小學現有二所，一在北四川路橫浜橋南，一在新閘路西摩路北，共有小舉生及幼稚生約一千人）。</p>
<p>以上所舉計劃，有為目前或最近之將來即須實現者，有須假以時日方得有成者，自應分別緩急，切實圖之，尤須羣策羣力，始克有濟。邦人君子幸賜敎焉。</p>

<h3>結晶體振盪器之改良</h3>
<p>— 鑑</p>
<p>利用結晶體來做振盪器，其優點是發振時比較安定，但有一種缺點就是在發振時，結晶體的發振子，時有破壞之慮，致不引起振盪，且整節亦頗非易易。這裏所要介紹的一種改良的方法就是要補救上述的缺點的。</p>
<p>方法就是在振盪管的屏柵兩極間，和柵絲兩極間同時各揷入一結晶體發振子。如第一圖所示，（一）為振盪管，（二）為揷在屏栅兩極間的水晶發振子，（三）為揷在柵絲兩極間的水晶發振子，這兩種發振子均須選擇發振週率之相等者。（四）為屏路配諧電路，中揷有自感量綫圈（五）及調節用的變量電容器（六）。（七）為測量配諧電路（四）中的電流所用的電流表，（八）為測量屏電流的電流表。（九）與（十）為固定電容器。</p>
<p>現在把屏配諧電路（四）的變量電容器調節時，則由水晶發振子引起强的振盪電流。此時若利用電流表（七）來測量配諧電路（四）中的電流，則該電流隨電容器（六）C之增减而發生如第二圖之變化。圖中縱軸代表配諧電流，橫軸代表電容器（六）之電容量，其最高峰ⅠA與ⅡA各Ⅰ——各表示配諧時之電流。卽如電容器（六）之容量小時，則發振子（三）依照1的曲綫發振；，如電容器（六）之容量大時，則發振子（二）依照Ⅱ的曲綫發振。</p>
<p>因此在使用中，如一發振子破壞時，立可利用另一發振子以為發振，故此種改良法如應用於移動用的通信機等頗為便利。</p>
<h3>真空管的新發展PC.A6E5號「電子光調節指示管」</h3>
<p>— 庸言</p>
<p>因收音機製造的進步，新式收音機的選擇性，靈敏度及傳眞度，均遠勝一般老式收音機。但同時調節上則發生一重大困難，因若調節不合時，不但震敏度大為减退，且又可引起發聲失眞。此種因難若不能掃除，則構造精密的收音機，將因不易調節，而不克發揮其本能矣。</p>
<p>6E5號「電子光調節指示眞空管（Electron　ray　indicator　tube」，卽為所謂調節指示器（Tuning　indicator）」中的一種，使能得到最準確的調節者也。</p>
<p>6E5號眞空管的內部構造如第一圖，管中除去一個三極管的屏栅陰外，特有一「電子靶（Target」，及一「電光控制極（ray　controlelcetrode）」。電子靶上塗有發光物質，故當接至乙電正極時，卽吸收陰極射出的電子使發光物質發光；而發光面積的多少，則用位於電子靶及陰極間的電光控制極以控制之。此電光控制極則與三極部份的屏極相接，而三極部份的柵極則通至自動音量控制部份；電光控制極上的電歷，遂與自動音量控制電壓發生關係；故同時電子靶上發光部份的成積，亦與自動昔量控制電壓有聯帶關係，換言之，卽隨訊號電厭而發生變動也。圖二卽為電譯子靶發光形式的二種，A圖調節不合法，無電台收到，發光部份約九十度；B圖調節已甚合法，發光部份的角度大為减小。故調節時，但須使電子靶子的發光部份减至最小，即得。</p>

<h3>兩隻電碼練飛機</h3>
<p>— 華馨</p>
<p>這裏來介紹一個電碼練習機，單用一個蜂嗚器和一組電池，能够同時作收發的練習，上圖就是牠的綫路圖，電容器C為o.5ufd是用來阻止由電池流出之直流流入聽筒，而由蜂嗚器所發出之成音週率則經過C而流入聽筒，如將電鍵和聽筒並聯揷入時，則可集多數同志在一處作通信之練習，諸君不妨一試。</p>
<h3>介紹特種二管短波收音機</h3>
<p>— 克勤</p>
<p>邇來來台林立，收音機眞空管之式樣亦日日更新，如業餘者仍用舊式眞空管以配合收音機，其效必微。新式眞空管，式樣頗多，6D6號式及76號式，亦頗為人樂用，蓋用之可使音量宏大與收音穩定也。今所介紹者，卽用此二式眞空管配合之二管短波收音機也。</p>
<p>此機之綫路詳附圖。機內以6D6號式眞空管作檢波，76號式眞空管作成音週率放大。檢波並應用波帶展闊裝置。其音量大小以五萬歐姆之炭質電阻管理之。</p>
<p>天綫竄路內加一小型變量電容器。其容量為〇〇〇〇五。其並聯全容器以C2為主，籍以調節各段波長。</p>
<p>此機收音之波長，範圍極廣，可自十七公尺至二百七十八公尺。共用四脚揷入式綫圈管四枚。波帶及用綫號碼等如左表</p>
<p>此機　用之零件，開列如後。</p>
<p>C1·〇〇〇一四變量電容器</p>
<p>C2·〇〇〇〇三五變量電容器</p>
<p>C3·〇〇〇五變量電容器</p>
<p>C4·〇〇〇二五栅極固定電容器</p>
<p>C5·〇一固定電容器　耐歷二百弗打</p>
<p>C6·一固定電容器　耐壓二百弗打</p>
<p>C7·五固定電容器　耐壓二百弗打</p>
<p>C8·〇〇〇一五固定電容器</p>

<p>R2五萬歐姆電阻　控制音量用</p>
<p>R3五十萬歐姆電阻</p>
<p>R4萬歐姆電阻</p>
<p>R5十萬歐姆電阻</p>
<p>R.F.S.高阻圈二千分寧利S.W.開關</p>
<p>此機因有二量電容器，故應將C1固定，然後方能將C2調節。先轉C2至二十度左右，後轉C1至聽到聲音為止。再將C2作微細調節。又此機因有四枚揷入式綫圈，故應將C1校準四次，並記住其度數；如是則第二次應用時可省臨時固定之勞矣。</p>

<h3>「極端文明」的武器和「新奇事物」</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>據說，意大利是一個文明國，阿比西尼亞則是一個野蠻國，這大概是不會錯的。我們不必舉出許多事來作證明，單看它們這回的厮殺，兩軍所使用的武器，便大有文明野蠻之別。意軍用以攻擊阿軍的是，毒瓦斯和達姆達姆彈，阿軍用以抗拒意軍的是，矛和盾。前者是現代的新戰器，後者則是古時的舊戰器。野蠻的阿國，要用古時的舊戰器，去對付文明的意國的現代的新戰器，其遭受慘殺，當是必然的結果。誰聽你阿國野蠻到這地步，在戰術進步，武器發達的今日，還拿出矛看想來和敵人拼命？眞正是活該！</p>
<p>然而我們一定要說，意大利是文明國，阿比西尼亞是野螢國，也是不公道的。就以使用毒瓦斯和達姆達姆彈來講，這兩種軍用品，不是早經國際上禁用的嗎？但稱為文明國的意大利，這次却稱背公約，使用這兩種毒物，來戕害阿人。而被人目為野蠻國的阿比西尼亞，反而不敢使用。在這裏，所謂文明人的眞面目，但充分暴露出來—</p>
<p>不過對於使用毒瓦斯和達姆達姆彈，雖經阿國向世宣布，但意大利却並不承認。這事駐英阿國公使館，頃發表聲明，加以答辯，謂意軍使用這種「極端文明」的武器，業由阿國外籍醫生團中的一員證明，如意軍繼續使用這種武器，則阿國不能再行禁止戰士不使用同樣的武器云。這一來，日後意軍要是再使用這種極端文明」的武器，來攻擊阿人，阿國無疑就要使用同樣的武器，去抗拒意人。到那時，意軍恐也難免要嘗試一次「極端文明」的武器的滋味。</p>
<p>可是阿比西尼亞雖則也一樣能使用「極端文明」的武器，但這却還不足以提高其文明的程度。怎麼說呢？但因為阿人自有生以來，尚未看見過電影。據日昨底格爾傳來消息，意軍現以影片充實宣傳力量，將於本日在阿杜華城開映，，這在該城居民，實自有生以來所僅見，影片內容，係意國內愛國示威運動，和九日間波爾柴諾城所舉行的陸空軍演習，藉以表示意國力量，屆時意軍各將領和兵士，均將到塲參觀，放映時，並用阿姆哈列克十語，加以說明，當地土著前往參觀這種「新奇事物」者，為數必多云。</p>
<p>可見意大利不但有「極端文明」的武器，而且還有「新奇事物」。你能說它不比阿比西尼亞文明嗎？</p>
<h3>病</h3>
<p>— 孟華</p>
<p>弟弟被他店裏的經理辭掉了。因為經理先生看見傾吐出來的痰混着血絲。</p>
<p>自然，這是我們不小的打擊。這樣每個月有定額的十八元的收入就隨着經理這宣告而一起失落了。本來我多半靠着弟弟，現在這生活的担子就要我担起來了，因為我歲數比他犬，病亦比他輕。不消說，沒有商量的餘地，我得悄悄地，而又勉强地把這担子接過來。</p>
<p>不幸的是弟弟因為失業的刺激，生活的無保障，已治好了的失眠症又開始襲擊他了。夜裏聽到他反來覆去，以及那低聲的喀嗽時，我亦就伴着他張開眼來張望着蚊帳，張望着房裏的一切，一直到天明。可是弟弟的雙頰是更加紅得怕人，嘴唇亦枯焦得可以了。</p>
<p>於是，我們不得不到鄉下來，這淸爽而新鮮的空氣對我們是有一點益處的。鄉問是靜謐的，我們的房子又浴在田野中間。每日，弟弟的喀嗽聲，跟着桌上那有節奏的鐘擺聲奏着一種凄切的而又憂鬰的調子。入夜，牆沿的秋虫亦奮翅唱着牠們那哀歌，這臨死的絕叫伴着那低低的嗽聲，無情形錐着我的心。</p>
<p>房子是靠近鐡路的，每日有幾十次火車打這裏經過，初是隱隱，接着便動地而來，述牆壁亦搖動着一樣。尖銳的汽笛，轟降的車聲，每一次都使我捲卷或放下筆來，靜靜地，莫明其妙地入神地聽着聽着。</p>
<p>「四哥，我聽見火車就想起……弟弟說。我明白他的意思，弟弟雖然病着，但他的意念，他的慾望却是如常，甚至反而健將起來的，他跟我完全一樣，聽着這搖撼一切的聲音，心兒早已飛到遠遠的那兒去了。</p>
<p>在這樣的境地裏，我的心情是沉鬱而憤慨的。是什麼迫得我們如此呢？牛活的担子，過度的勞作，一切的一切侵蝕了我弟弟的生命，使他身體的某一部份器官漸漸腐爛，漸漸毀壞，它要奪去了他的生命，他的幸福，甚至他的希望</p>
<p>今夜，在微弱的燈光下，我勇敢地執起筆來，决定寫點什麼，我想沒有錢送他到醫院裏去瞧瞧，亦該給弟弟實一瓶魚肝油了吧，讓他這樣下去是不行的。但我那能够寫些什麼呢？他的嗽聲像一把尖刀，無情地拕着我的心。我悲痛地，憤慨地望着燈光出神。</p>
<p>「四哥，歇一歇吧。你的身體亦不要弄壞呀。」突然，弟弟說了。</p>
<p>我回過頭去。床上的帳一幅掛上去，一掛垂下來，凄清地。我看見弟弟非常激動地望着我，兩雙眼晴像一把火炬，燃燒痛了我心。他一手按住胸脯，一壁喘着。我慌忙起身給他倒了一杯開水。他坐起來，低聲地說：「我已病了，要是你再病倒，我們這兩個人可就沒法過活呵！」</p>
<p>「你不要掛心吧，好好的養，有什麼不如意的都不要想他，你的身體不允許你胡思亂想，看看你的失眠就更厲害了。就想想他們的將來吧，你就愉快了。不嬰胡思亂想吧！」我勸慰着他說。我看見一串串清淚由他的眼角滴下來。秋虫哀惻地叫着，原野的風奏着悲壯的調子，和着我弟弟這嗽聲。</p>
<p>我重回坐位，披開紙，再度勇敢地提起筆來。「生活迫得你非寫不可呀，你要想到大夫跟魚肝油呀！」我鼓勵着自己。於是我拚着寫下去。</p>
<p>夜半醒來，弟弟還沒有睡。「弟弟，你還沒有睡好？」我驚異地問他。</p>
<p>「不，我剛醒來」。他說。顯然，這是一種掩飾。立刻地翻過身去，裝起鼾聲來。</p>
<p>「這樣下去是不行的。我想。「貧窮原是我們的影子，它是跟我們寸步不離的東西。可是我們一點亦不怕他，正如世上許許多多有希望，有意志的人們一樣。但是這樣的身體，這致命的病症就剝奪了我們的一切了。卽使冬天過了，就是春天，但弟弟這樣的身體能够耐過這殘酷的冬天麼？一個十九歲的靑年</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>，他有着多麽壯大的前途，但惡魔們卻迫着他，看看他就要死去了。這是多麽殘酷呵！」於是我的眼角又有點潤濕了。</p>
<h3>陰鬰的日子</h3>
<p>— 吉彖</p>
<p>「生於日陰的草木，若是不爲人手所移植，一生涯必須在那個日陰裏度那陰鬰的日子；然而幸虧人類能奪取到那無限止地被賦予的自然界的强身劑。日光是不僅能使身體得到好的結果，就是對於精神上的影響，也是很大的。祇要從病床上仰望着蒼藍色的天空，就會感到很大的歡喜，所以處身在整個的日光中，是一定會得到至上的愉快的。」—（小酒井不木）</p>
<p>在生活失掉了重心的日子中，在過不完的衰落的哀愁與頹喪中，自家兒那脆弱的靈魂，幾乎要給毀滅的黑手所牽動，而打算要跟着它藏身到一個不知道的世界中去的時候，我從一本小冊子裏面看到了那末幾句話。</p>
<p>像通過了高壓電流似的，神經猛地給着實地打了一下，在一種沒有準備的失措的情况中，我呆住了；我細想着這些奇怪的語句。</p>
<p>樸素的，平淡的，眞實而未加渲染的語句啊，它所給予一個生活在陰鬱的日子中的靈魂的啟示，該是有着多麽的奇妙與不可解呢？</p>
<p>從這裏邊，彷彿獲得某些可貴的情緒似的，一種感激像古溫泉那樣噴起，而一種埋伏在靈魂的深處之先天的倔强，則如火山之爆發了。這時候，我開始感得憤怒，也感到恥辱。</p>
<p>「植物被移植在日陰中的時候，它就祗能在那裏憤度過一生的陰鬱的日子了。」這時代，與自家兒一機，也許同樣有無數的靈魂是被移植到日陰中去，而在那裏過着過不完的「陰鬱的日子」的吧？然而，被移植的終究是「靈魂」，屬於人類之一部的靈魂，而不是沒有嘴眼與手足的植物啊。生活是凶的，而那一連串的「陰鬱的日子「也是可怕的；然而，想一想吧：是人，而不是可隨意被移植的「植物」啊；支配生活是人類自己，而並不是說：支配人類的是可怕的生活呀！</p>
<p>一種恥辱，一種憤怒，一種自信與驕傲（是「人類的驕傲」），像三月裏的泥地上面的溫熱的濕氣那樣地，朦朧地騰起來。自家是已被移植到了不見日光的陰處中去，而生活在「陰鬱的日子」裏了：可是，拿起鏡子照照，年靑的倔强依然拭抹不去地刻劃在消瘦的臉上呢。「不是嫩弱無知的植物，不應當儘着被移植呀。」那感想。</p>
<p>於是，重又從黑暗的，狹小的室內望出：天是藍的，海是廣大的，太陽在山那邊，依舊兀然地照耀着：外面的世界不是還有着被陽光照得光亮而溫熱的處所嗎？不是那……？</p>
<p>想着，眼前的陰鬱的日子所給予我的壓力，彷彿輕鬆得多。它對我，不再顯得那麼沉重，牢固，烏黑與窒息了：它對我，不再有支配者的主人與魔王的嘴臉了；我學到了把它看得很輕的技巧，我學會了用着火星併裂的憤怒與倔强」！</p>
<p>是的，不是細小的植物，而是人類啊！不是說過的麼？「人類所引以爲幸的，就是能够用了自己底意思來奪取這自然界的健身劑—日光啊。」是的，那是人類的驕傲！從不健全的病床上眺望外面的靑空，已經能叫人感到歡喜，而假使能處身於用自己底力量去奪取來的無邊的目光中呢……？</p>
<p>生活，你用盡了最後的一點力氣來把人移植到日陰裏去吧！陰鬱的日子，你也使出你所有的卑汚來吧！</p>
<p>人可不是植物—人是有着他自己的慶幸和賦與的。</p>
<h3>孤寂</h3>
<p>— 耳禾</p>
<p>因爲是星期日，早上起來便遲了點。茶房把荳漿拿了來，說是快要冷了，於是揉揉惺忪的眼緊忙忙起來。來不及洗臉，刷牙，便把荳漿，荳頁都吃完了。心想，你是最上的補品呢，比魚肝油等的效力要大得多。於是把舌尖在嘴唇上舐了一會，覺得味道的確是濃濃的。</p>
<p>散步回來，看看太陽已透過門前的柏樹頂了，向桌子上一瞥，便看見了如小山樣的課卷，心想，理他呢。於是在躺椅裏躺下，並不想抽烟，只覺得默沉沉的，心中是無底的空虛。略略幻想了一會，行將毀滅的靈魂又在蠢蠢思動了。呵，我覺得孤寂。這孤寂，甚至無法排遣。我明知桌子上有許多工作要我去做，並且趁這星期日把這些撈什子肅淸一次對人對已都是有益的事情，星期一的鞭子是行將抽打來了嗎？可是我只默沉沉的，躺在睡椅裏，不想做什麽，我只挨着難挨的寂寞，心中是無底的空虛。</p>
<p>規定的，辦公廳裏的兩小時的辦公，我也懶得去，甯願在孤寂的屋子裏，</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>埃着難挨的孤寂。從前窗望出去，那片草地雖然經了秋的煊染，但還是靑靑的，這，更使我感到了自己的老邁的悲哀。常常有小雀子在古老的孔廟的椽柱問吱吱喳喳地叫，但這不但能打破寂寞，反增加了寂寞的濃重。有時不經意抽像跌下來似的跳在草地上，戞的一聲，使我驚醒地望過去，我以爲是不速之客的足音呢。是的，此時我多麽迫切地希望着有一個人來談談，我將欵待他一支烟，一杯白開水，我將對他說，我是如何地感到孤寂，可是就在談着孤寂，孤寂中，我可以把孤寂打發過去了。然而朋友在那兒？於是我抬着頭望望天外的白雲，白　是飄過揚子江去的吧，白雲是飄過大都市的天頂上去的吧？那麽，它該看見我的友人。在鴿籠式的屋子裏，朋友們在做些什麽呢？也許也在望着天外的白　吧？想着，孤寂之感愈來愈濃了。於是再也忍不住，抽起烟來了。裊裊的烟紋裏，我看見了許多飄渺的夢…。於是吱吱喳喳的小雀子不知飛到那兒去了，可是孤寂更濃重了。於是想起了一位外國作家的「沙漠中的艷事。」一個法國水兵被阿刺伯人俘去了，乘夜奔跳，却迷失了路，走入一片沙漠中，於是遇看一隻雌豹，寂寞裏，他和雌豹像一對愛人了。我的確也在需要着任何的生物，貓兒，豹兒……，可是連剛剛來的吱吱喳喳的小雀子也不知飛到那兒去了。於是噴着烟紋，顧濃白的，繚繞的烟紋佔有這間孤寂的屋子吧。</p>
<p>吃過午飯，像一隻垂斃的寒蝶倒在床上了。一覺醒來，覺得午夢也是孤寂的。看看太陽已從後窗穿進好許多來了。人是躺在睡椅裏，望着桌子上的如小山樣的課卷，但只是默沉沉的。到了最最孤寂時再有什麽辦法來排遣呢？工作是一件也不能做的坐着，又如何把遲遲寂寂的時間挨度過去呢。看看屋內的白牆上的陽光漸漸地拉長了，但那是多麼老邁呵，深秋的太陽已老邁了嗎？</p>
<p>窗外偶然飄來輕輕的一陣風把桌子上的書頁翻了幾頁，但隨卽又自家闔上了。牆上的陽光老是移得慢慢的，看着，看着，我只在想有人會敲我的門。除此以外，我只在想黃昏快一點來吧，然而跟在黃昏後的是漫漫的長夜……</p>

<p>據聞此次中　主人袁鳳舉君消券一千四百元之巨，更於一月之內趕拚蕭何追韓信一劇，此公辦事素來有　頭，前接手華興電台時，三日特別節目而名聞海上，及接辦中華電台又以特別節月見長，則此次義賬會的結果，當較諸電影界賑災會有顏色了！（以上金郎）</p>
<p>日昨雇車到佛音電台玩了一個多鐘頭，恰巧是時代歌劇社的播音節目，逢到了他們的全班人馬，得到許多動聽的談話例下：王琪小姐：純粹可以說是一個懂得歌唱興趣的姑娘，她有着健美的體格，的確不是一般拿了脂粉的力量去誘惑小開的像伙可比，我問她爲什麽播音？她微笑着答：高興！</p>
<p>林鶯：偶然的看到，一定以爲她是個大人，但事實上還是一個怪活潑的小孩呢！她告訴我，不過爲了葉英和葉紅到暹邏去而來代替的罷了。</p>
<p>朱叔牙，是他們的社長，整理歌譜時候的一副尊容，實在像找不着了獎券似的急，可是，結果，還是要被樂隊方面的朋友摧得不亦樂乎，唉！已經算熱心的嘍。</p>
<p>祭劍魂：小猴子似的熱情着跳，多虧他的張羅道地，否則，小姐的脾氣也眞厲害，這因爲他是歌唱組的領導。</p>
<p>芳蘭：才十六歲，做人的手段像她唱的歌一樣老練，是一家產科學校的高材生哩。話劇組是劉亞偉的領導，人員有燕羣，許靜雅和她的哥哥靜聲，金今，梁篤生。</p>
<p>劉君告訴我，社員里頭還有劉莉影，倉隱秋，魏鶴齡，高茫聲算人，執行播演的人是時常掉換的，目的在團聚的興趣，生意倒是附帶，在播完了楊貴妃以後，打算採取電影劇本桃花扇夾改編，大概月底以前一定實現了。</p>
<p>這一羣除了本來素有播音經騐的老將以外，就是在舞台上或者銀幕里很有修養的朋友，希望他們，不單以團聚的興趣爲前題，而且抱起了可能之下的敎育精神來增加點相當社敎的力量。（阿李）</p>

<h3>銀色雜筆</h3>
<p>— 之爾</p>
<p>「老客人」袁牧之所介紹的電通新人張新珠，和電通所訂的合同本爲一年，現在據說將半途撕合同，原因是：電通方面鑒於張新珠在「都市風光一中成績並不佳，而張新珠呢，上銀幕本來是作爲「自我宣傳」用，所以有一部戲拍過，也已經心願意足，認爲目的已達，不想冉幹下去了。</p>

<h3>Draft Constitution Passed Third Reading by the Legislative Yuan; One Article Retained for Amendment Based on Reconsideration Result; Full Text Comprises Eight Chapters, Nine Sections, and One Hundred Fifty Articles</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan convened its 35th session on the morning of the 25th, with 71 members present, including Liu Zhendong and others. President Sun Ke and Secretary-General Liang Han Cao, after announcing the minutes of the 24th session, Fu Bingchang reported on the review of the articles retained from the 24th session. As a result, as proposed by the Chairman, the article was revised to read: "For resolutions of the Legislative Yuan, the President may, before promulgation or execution, submit them for reconsideration. If the Legislative Yuan, upon reconsideration of the aforementioned proposal, maintains the original proposal with a two-thirds majority of the members present, the President shall immediately promulgate or execute it; however, in the case of legal bills or treaty bills, a request may be made to the next National Congress for a final decision." After the retained article was amended and passed, the Chairman, with the amendment to the entire draft constitution, omitted the third reading and put it to a vote, which was unanimously passed by all members without objection. Subsequently, other routine proposals were reviewed. According to the draft constitution previously passed by the Legislative Yuan, there were 12 chapters, six sections, and 178 articles. The review report of the amendment changed this to eight chapters, nine sections, and 149 articles. The version passed in the third reading on the 25th contains eight chapters, nine sections, and 150 articles. The most important differences between this amendment and the original draft, excluding those that have been deleted, are as follows: 1. In the original draft, the presidents of the Judicial and Examination Yuans were to be nominated by the President and appointed with the consent of the Legislative Yuan. The amendment states that the President's appointment of the presidents of the Judicial and Examination Yuans is an exercise of a portion of political power by the head of state on behalf of the people. The Legislative Yuan is an organ exercising the power of governance. If the appointment of the presidents of the Judicial and Examination Yuans is always subject to its consent, it would be tantamount to granting the Legislative Yuan the special power to exercise political power, which conflicts with the principle of the division of powers and functions advocated by Sun Yat-sen. In the five-power system, the Legislative Yuan is balanced against the Judicial and Examination Yuans. If the presidents of the Judicial and Examination Yuans require the consent of the Legislative Yuan, the Legislative Yuan would appear to be in a position of superiority, which is particularly contrary to the spirit of the five-power constitution created by Sun Yat-sen. Therefore, the amendment has authorized the President to appoint the presidents of the Judicial and Examination Yuans directly, deleting the phrase "with the consent of the Legislative Yuan." 2. Regarding cases of reconsideration by the President of resolutions of the Legislative Yuan, if the President still believes that there is disagreement in policy, the original draft stipulated that they "shall still be promulgated or executed." To avoid future disputes between the President and the Legislative Yuan due to policy disagreements, the amendment has added a proviso stating that in the case of legal bills or treaty bills, a request may be made to the next National Congress for a final decision. 3. For matters stipulated in the Constitution that require a separate implementation process, the original draft did not contain such a provision because articles similar to implementation laws were not deleted. The amendment has deleted all such articles from the original draft, and to remedy potential difficulties in future implementation, a new article has been added stipulating that it may be determined by law. (Central News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan convened its 34th session at 2:00 PM on the 24th, with 72 members present, chaired by Sun Ke. The draft constitution was reviewed, passed through the second reading, and one article was retained to be reviewed by the original committee and submitted to the third reading for discussion on the morning of the 25th. After the meeting opened, Fu Bingchang first reported on the review process, stating that two meetings had been held and that revisions were made item by item based on the five principles set by the Central Government. Chapter 1, General Principles, Chapter 2, Rights and Duties of the People, and Chapter 3, the National Congress, remained unchanged from the original draft. Article 47 of Chapter 4, Central Government, was deleted, and Article 56, concerning the number of Ministers of State in the Executive Yuan, was changed from 20 to "a certain number." In Article 71, regarding the President's reconsideration of a resolution upheld by the Legislative Yuan, "shall immediately promulgate or execute it" was changed to "may be left to the next National Congress for reconsideration." Articles 78 and 87, concerning the selection of presidents of the Judicial and Examination Yuans, stipulated that they would be appointed solely by the President, and the original provision requiring the consent of the Legislative Yuan was deleted. The organizations of the various Yuans were not specified; only their powers were defined. Chapter 5, Provinces, Chapter 6, Counties, and Chapter 7, Cities, were merged into a chapter entitled "Local Government System," dividing local political systems into sections on provinces, counties, and cities. Only organizational principles were specified; the remainder would be determined by law. Chapter 8, National Economy, and Chapter 9, Education, remained unchanged. Chapter 10, Finance, was deleted, and articles from that chapter that needed to be retained were incorporated into the Chapter on National Economy. Chapter 11, Military Affairs, was also deleted. A new Chapter 12, Supplementary Provisions, was added: "The implementation procedures of the Constitution shall be determined by law." In total, the revised draft constitution contained eight chapters, nine sections, and 149 articles. After Fu's report, the second reading discussion began. The deletion of Article 47, "Military personnel shall not be eligible for election as President or Vice President unless they have been discharged from their posts," was passed without objection. In the Chapter on Local Government System, the phrase "Military personnel shall not be eligible for appointment as provincial governor until three years after their discharge" was also deleted according to the proposal. Article 55, changing the number of Ministers of State from twenty to "a certain number," was also passed. Articles 79, 80, 88, 89, 99, 101, 102, 103, 111, 112, 119, and 120 were all passed for deletion. The original chapters on Provinces, Counties, and Cities were merged into the Chapter on Local Government System. The original chapters on Finance and Military Affairs were deleted. Articles 159 and 160, originally in the Chapter on Finance, were retained and incorporated into the Chapter on National Economy, which was also passed without objection. A new article was added to the Chapter on Supplementary Provisions, which was also passed. During the discussion of the revised Article 70, "For resolutions of the Legislative Yuan, the President may, before promulgation or execution, submit them for reconsideration. If the Legislative Yuan, upon reconsideration of the aforementioned proposal, maintains the original proposal with a two-thirds majority of the members present, the President may leave it to the next National Congress for reconsideration," Chen Changheng advocated changing "may" to "shall." After debate, it was referred back to the original review committee for review and submission to the third reading for discussion. Furthermore, in the revised Articles 77 and 89, the phrase "with the consent of the Legislative Yuan" concerning the appointment of the presidents of the Judicial and Examination Yuans was deleted, which was also passed after debate. In addition, the original Articles 98 and 100, which originally stipulated the procedures for the Control Yuan to exercise the power of impeachment over central and local civil servants, and the organs for impeaching the President, Vice President, heads of the Legislative, Judicial, Examination, and Control Yuans, and members of the Legislative and Control Yuans, were deleted in the amendment. After debate, the original articles were restored, and at the same time, Article 93 of the amendment was deleted. Finally, the new addition to the Supplementary Provisions, "The implementation procedures of the Constitution shall be determined by law," was the subject of the most intense debate. After a vote, the amendment was passed as proposed. (Central News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At its session on the 24th, the Legislative Yuan re-amended the draft constitution based on the principles decided by the Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee on the 17th. The principles set by the Standing Committee are excerpted as follows: (1) To respect the historical foundation of the revolution, the spirit of the Three Principles of the People, the Outline of National Reconstruction, and the Provisional Constitution for the Period of Political Tutelage should be the basis of the draft constitution. (2) The organization of the government should take into account actual political experience to create a system that is flexible in operation and can concentrate national strength. The limitations on the exercise of executive power should not be rigid. (3) The central government and local systems should be broadly defined in terms of their powers in the draft constitution, and their organizations should be determined by law. (4) For articles in the draft constitution that must be stipulated but cannot be implemented immediately or simultaneously throughout the country, the implementation procedures should be determined by law. (5) The articles of the constitution should not be numerous, and the wording should be concise. (Central News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The following routine proposals were discussed at the Legislative Yuan session on the 25th: (1) The Organic Law of the Provincial Civil Service Commission: Resolved to be re-referred to the Legal System Committee for review.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Excerpts from the Report of the Telephone Experts</h3>
<p>— Dao</p>
<p>The telephone experts hired by the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession have had excerpts from their report published in newspapers. The report describes the modern equipment, attentive service, and reasonable and necessary expenditures of the Shanghai Telephone Company. It then confirms the appropriateness of the Shanghai Telephone Company's adoption of a per-call charging system based on the 1% guaranteed interest stipulated in the franchise contract signed with the Public Concession and French Concession Municipal Councils on August 5, 1930. It also proposes a price list that stipulates a monthly fee of 10 yuan for business telephones with 150 calls, and 6.5 yuan for residential telephones with 100 calls. Beyond these limits, all calls, whether business or residential, will be charged at a rate of 3 cents per call. At the same time, three cost-saving measures are recommended: (1) reducing advertising expenses; (2) reducing expenses for telephone management; and (3) reducing high-salary foreign staff and hiring lower-salary staff to save money. The main points of the summary are generally limited to these.</p>
<p>Although we have not yet seen the full text of the report, based on the various key points of the summary, the experts have largely accepted the Shanghai Telephone Company's claims and do not seem to have fully taken into account the interests of consumers. This shortcoming should be the result of the limited scope of research specified by the Municipal Council. The most obvious is that the report considers the 1% guaranteed interest in the Municipal Council's franchise contract as a given, and does not take into account the market conditions at the time the contract was signed, which are vastly different from the current depressed market conditions. A 1% guaranteed interest may have been reasonable in the past, but in the current economic downturn, there is a need for flexibility. Moreover, the bonds issued by the Shanghai Telephone Company are only at 6%. Since they are not difficult to sell, consumers should not be burdened with more than 6% interest. Therefore, for the sake of fairness and to help promote the prosperity of the market, it seems that the 1% guaranteed interest should be considered at a 60% discount. Once the market recovers and prospers, the full interest can be taken again. After all, all industries have declined to the extreme, with very little profit to be made. Telecommunications is a public utility, and should not be in a uniquely advantageous position.</p>
<p>While the principle of a per-call charging system may seem unobjectionable in principle, the current regulations stipulate that (1) the basic number of calls is too small, and (2) the extra charge for additional calls is also high. In short, this may greatly increase the burden on users. According to the experts' recommendations, even private telephones can only make 100 calls per month, which averages only three calls per day. Beyond this, an extra fee must be charged. If a family needs to install a telephone, it is naturally because they have more social interactions. In any case, they will inevitably exceed the range of three calls per day. As for businesses, 150 calls per month, totaling only five calls per day, is naturally far from sufficient. Therefore, including the extra fee, the cost will be several times higher than at present. It can be said with certainty that this shift, nominally rationalized, is tantamount to an invisible increase in prices several times over. Even considering the private monthly fee of 6.5 yuan for only 100 calls, each call costs 6.5 cents, which is more than 20 copper coins. The high cost is self-evident. The greatest function of the telephone is originally to increase the economic benefits of citizens. Now, each call costs more than a dozen copper coins, so the telephone can be called an absolute luxury item. As for business telephones, with a charge of more than 6.6 cents per call, this is nothing less than an exorbitant tax on the business community. Moreover, according to the experts' estimates, 47% of private users and 41% of businesses can reduce their expenses after the per-call charging system is adopted. It is not known whether this estimate is based on statistical figures. According to this estimate, it is equivalent to asserting that 47% of existing private users do not exceed the range of making three calls per day, and 41% of business users do not exceed the limit of making five calls per day. However, according to our observations, this is not the case in reality. We believe that while the per-call charging system is unobjectionable, the basic number of calls must be increased. At the very least, the cost of calls within the basic number should not exceed the high price of 3 cents per call. The extra charge of 3 cents per call should also be reduced appropriately, or a corresponding discount should be given as the number of calls increases, so that merchants can still maintain the benefits of installing a telephone.</p>
<p>The experts' final recommendations mention various cost-saving points, such as reducing advertising expenses, tightening management expenses, and dismissing high-salary foreign staff. It seems that numbers can be specified, deadlines can be set, and these can be implemented as soon as possible. If this is still not enough to make up the difference, the price of telephone calls should be raised again, so that the burden on users does not increase first. Furthermore, although the summary of the report suggests that the company should be investigated again if the profits are too high, it does not seem to address whether users' fees can be reduced at that time. It is not known whether the full text of the report has considered this. In our opinion, public utilities should first consider the interests of consumers and pay attention to the general economic conditions. They should not seek high profits for the telephone company alone in the midst of economic decline.</p>
<h3>Roth Did Not Make Any Recommendations Regarding Recognizing the Status Quo of Manchukuo; British Foreign Secretary Answers Questions from Labor Party Members; Negotiations Underway to Clear Accumulated Road Loan Payments</h3>
<p>(London) During the question time in the House of Commons today, many questions about China were raised. Foreign Secretary Hoare, in answering questions from Labor Party member Maxse, said that Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, the British government's economic advisor, had discussed the issue of improving Sino-Japanese relations, which the British government desired, in the Far East. He had, of course, inquired about the Chinese government's attitude towards this matter, but the British government or Sir Frederick Leith-Ross had not advised the Chinese government to recognize the existing political system in Manchuria. Conservative Party member Moreing asked about the long-overdue repayment of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway loan. Hoare replied that a method had previously been agreed upon, by which the railway would allocate a special reserve fund to clear the arrears. However, both principal and interest under this method were overdue. British Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen had repeatedly urged the Chinese government to find a way to repay it, and Sir Frederick Leith-Ross had also recently done so. The matter was currently under careful consideration by the Chinese government. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Hoare stated in the House of Commons today, in response to a question about the status of the Shanghai International Settlement, that the government had recently received several reports from Sir Knatchbull-Hugessen, the British Ambassador to China, regarding this matter. He also stated that he had instructed the ambassador to prepare a special report on this matter, which was currently unnecessary. The Foreign Secretary emphatically stated that the ambassador would go to Shanghai and other commercial centers whenever his personal presence was required. The embassy in Nanjing had recently been expanded, and the ambassador would soon be able to reside there for most of the year. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>

<h3>Resolving the Italian-Ethiopian Dispute: Three Nations Continue Negotiations; Talks Are Only Exploratory and Have Not Reached the Level of Actual Politics; French Foreign Ministry Denies Italian Prime Minister's New Proposal; Italy Withdraws Troops from Libya, Easing the European Situation</h3>
<p>(Rome) According to a semi-official spokesperson, the current negotiations among Paris, Rome, and London regarding the resolution of the Italian-Ethiopian dispute are merely of a general informative nature and lack a concrete plan as the basis for negotiation. Furthermore, according to inquiries by a Havas reporter, while the Italian government supports direct negotiations with Britain and France, it does not oppose resolving the Italian-Ethiopian issue within the League of Nations framework. Political figures believe that various compromises can be sought between direct negotiations and handling by the League of Nations. For example, the Chaco dispute between Paraguay and Bolivia was resolved through mediation by neighboring South American countries and then approved by the League of Nations Council. This shows that direct negotiations and League of Nations handling are not mutually exclusive. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) Political circles here express the view that the general public earnestly hopes that the ongoing peace explorations between Paris and Rome will yield results within a few days, or that there will be legitimate reasons to postpone the implementation of sanctions when the Sanctions Coordination Committee meets on October 31 to decide the date for implementing sanctions. There is currently little evidence to confirm this hope. The diplomatic exchange of views is underway, with the British government being informed at all times, but it can be said that Britain is now merely an observer. It is currently believed here that French Prime Minister Laval also believes that the peace talks between Rome and Paris have not yet reached the stage of actual politics. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) Official sources state that the British government is prepared to implement financial and economic sanctions against Italy in early November, as a solution to the Italian-Ethiopian dispute may not be reached before the implementation of sanctions. Although Italy's proposal, transmitted through Paris, proves that Italy has made efforts in mediation, it cannot serve as a solid basis for future negotiations. Official sources believe that all proposals that advocate dividing Ethiopian territory into the core territory and conquered land (i.e., areas not belonging to the provinces of Amhara) and allowing these lands to remain under the rule of the Ethiopian Emperor are opposed by Britain in principle. This is because when Ethiopia requested to join the League of Nations in 1923, Italy had already recognized the territories conquered by former Ethiopian Emperor Menelik II, namely the provinces of Harar, Tigray, and Wollega, as Ethiopian territory. Apart from this, the most satisfactory action taken by Italy recently is the withdrawal of troops from Libya and their return to Italy, instead of stationing them in the colony of Tripolitania as originally planned. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Official sources state that the purpose of the negotiations among Britain, France, and Italy regarding the resolution of the Italian-Ethiopian dispute is to clarify the international atmosphere, determine the procedures for progress, and decide on the stance to be taken on fundamental issues. There is no definite plan yet. According to our reporter, this matter was initiated by a country not directly related to the Italian-Ethiopian dispute, which proposed suggestions to both parties so that each side could understand the other's views. These suggestions do not have a concrete form, and a concrete plan can only be proposed after the procedural issues are resolved. The procedural issues are of deep concern to Britain. Political figures here believe that with the upcoming British parliamentary elections, negotiations between Britain and Italy are difficult to conduct. Once the elections are over on November 14, an agreement to resolve the Italian-Ethiopian dispute can be announced in a short period of time. However, if the economic sanctions decided by the League of Nations are implemented, it may cause difficulties, which would require separate consideration. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Newspapers published news stating that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini had submitted a new proposal to Prime Minister Laval to resolve the Italian-Ethiopian dispute and that Laval had notified the British Ambassador to France, Clerk, this morning. The Foreign Ministry has since denied this, stating that it did not happen. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) According to official announcements, French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval has already addressed the issue proposed by the Italian government. (Havas, 24th)</p>

<p>(Paris) Although the British and French governments have denied the new proposal by the Italian government to resolve the Italian-Ethiopian dispute, the *L'Ere Nouvelle* newspaper here published the main points of this new proposal as follows: (1) Italy has decided to withdraw two divisions of troops stationed in Italian Libya and does not demand the withdrawal of British warships from the Mediterranean as an exchange condition. (2) Italy agrees to immediately cease hostilities once the British government submits a response. (3) Italy will not continue to send troops to East Africa before receiving the British response. (4) Italy suggests that if Britain deems it acceptable, it should be submitted to the League of Nations' Committee of Eighteen and the Council of Five. The Italian government believes that the above four suggestions are the country's greatest concessions. As for the content of Italy's demands, according to *L'Ere Nouvelle*, it does not advocate making the Ethiopian provinces of Harar, Wollega, and Tigray Italian protectorates or mandates, but only requests that these provinces be leased to Italy, preserving the nominal sovereignty of the Ethiopian Emperor. In addition, the international assistance plan previously proposed by the Committee of Five should be implemented within the core territory of Ethiopia. Italy also promises not to train indigenous troops in the leased territories mentioned above, but may organize police, whose number and equipment can be monitored by the signatories of the 1906 Tripartite Agreement, namely Britain, France, and Italy. In addition, Ethiopia may organize a standing army in its core territory, led by the Ethiopian Emperor, but all residents of the country should be disarmed. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>Withdrawal of Libyan Troops - A False Move</h3>
<p>(Rome) It was officially announced here today that the government has ordered the withdrawal of a division of troops stationed in Libya. According to the official statement, this order is an independent action by the Italian government, and the British government has not made a similar commitment. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(Rome) It was officially announced here today that an Italian army division will be immediately withdrawn from Libya and returned to Italy, but Britain does not need to reduce the number of its naval vessels stationed in the Mediterranean in response. The diplomatic circles were very surprised by the peaceful tone of this announcement, as the general public believed that Italy would insist on an exchange condition. According to a Foreign Ministry spokesperson, this move should be seen as Italy's contribution to maintaining peace in Europe. (Guomin, 24th)</p>
<p>Naples: The Italian "Medo Division" currently stationed in Cyrenaica, Libya, Africa, has been ordered to return to Italy. The steamer "Sannia" has recently sailed to Libya to load the division's equipment. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<h3>British Naval Redeployment in the Mediterranean</h3>
<p>(London) The Admiralty officially announced today that the battleship HMS *Courageous* has departed from Alexandria, Egypt, today for Portsmouth. The battleship HMS *Ramillies* is scheduled to depart for Alexandria on November 1 to relieve the *Courageous*. (Guomin, 25th)</p>
<p>Malta, Valletta: Authorities here stated today that Britain does not intend to withdraw its fleet in the Mediterranean. The dispatch of the warships HMS *Hood* and HMS *Renown* to the Mediterranean when Italian troops were concentrating was purely a routine matter. Therefore, even if Italy withdraws a division of troops from Libya, it is unlikely to change Britain's naval policy. It is also learned today that the recent activity of Italian submarines in British territorial waters to make Britain decide not to withdraw any warships for the time being seems even more compelling. (Guomin, 25th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Coordination Committee Scheduled to Meet Next Thursday to Decide on Date for Implementing Sanctions; Hoare to Attend with Eden</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Secretary-General of the League of Nations recently notified the governments of the Covenant countries on behalf of the Coordination Committee that the Chairman of the Coordination Committee and the Committee of Eighteen, Visconde de Vasconcelos, has scheduled a meeting of the Committee of Eighteen at the League of Nations Secretariat at 10:30 AM on October 31, and a meeting of the Coordination Committee at 5:00 PM that afternoon. (Central News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Assembly's Committee of Eighteen on Sanctions is scheduled to continue its meeting here on October 31. It is reported that British Foreign Secretary Hoare and Minister Without Portfolio Eden will come to attend, but French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval may not have time to attend due to busy domestic affairs. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<h3>China's Notification to the League of Nations; Reply Has Not Yet Been Issued</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to diplomatic sources, China is still considering its response to the League of Nations' notification regarding economic sanctions against Italy, so a reply has not yet been issued. As for rumors that a reply will be given to the League of Nations before the 28th, it is said that there is no definitive provision in the League of Nations' notification. (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Sanctions Issue; White House Discussing Reply; Will Reiterate Actions Taken Under Neutrality Law; Decided to Stay Out of the Italian-Ethiopian Dispute</h3>
<p>(Washington) It is reported that President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull agreed today on the wording of the reply to the League of Nations regarding the sanctions against Italy. According to reliable sources, the reply will only reiterate the actions taken by the United States under the Neutrality Law and will not comment on the League of Nations' proposal to end the Italian-Ethiopian War. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to reliable sources, Secretary of State Hull met with President Roosevelt today to discuss the United States' attitude towards the League of Nations' implementation of sanctions against Italy and the issue of the US representatives at the London Naval Conference. Hull had lunch with the President at the White House today, and the main topic of discussion was the reply to the League of Nations on the sanctions issue. The President and Hull paid close attention to the issue of banning arms exports to Italy, and government advisors also disagreed. According to the Neutrality Law passed by Congress, it is difficult to determine whether the President has the power to announce this ban. (Guomin, 24th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Since the State Department received the League of Nations' memorandum on sanctions against Italy, President Roosevelt has discussed with Secretary of State Hull three times how to respond. Because the authorities are keeping the matter secret, the outside world knows nothing. Hull has also had long talks with State Department officials, but has not consulted experts on wartime neutrality laws. Some people have therefore concluded that the State Department has not yet drafted a reply and will not submit a reply to the League of Nations before the beginning of next week. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<h3>Sharp Increase in US Exports to Italy</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Department of Commerce announced today that US exports of chemicals and related products in September totaled $12,030,000, compared to $10,884,000 in September 1934. Exports of naval stores totaled $1,618,200, an increase of $291,550 compared to the same period a year ago. Most of these naval stores were shipped to Italy, resulting in a 15% increase in US exports to Italy. US rubber exports for the first nine months of this year totaled $16,369,676, less than the exports for the same period last year, which totaled $16,547,214. (Guomin, 24th)</p>

<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Hoare issued regulations today strictly prohibiting the shipment of arms and ammunition to Italy. (Guomin, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) The Board of Trade issued a bulletin stating that all licenses for transporting arms to Italy have been revoked in accordance with the resolution of the Geneva Sanctions Committee. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>Third Day of British House of Commons Session; Foreign Policy Debate Concludes; Fifty Nations Reaffirm Public Law; Aggressors Will Ultimately Be Difficult to Sustain; Attention Called to German Rearmament, Considered More Serious Than Italian-Ethiopian Conflict; Churchill's Eloquent Speech</h3>
<p>(London) Today was the third and final day of the House of Commons debate on international events. The highlight of the session was Churchill's brilliant speech, which was applauded by the entire House. Home Secretary Simon spoke on behalf of the government, concluding the debate, mostly focusing on domestic achievements. After the debate, no vote was taken. Churchill began by drawing attention to the extent and speed of German rearmament, stating that Germany had spent £800 million on direct and indirect military preparations, a figure almost unbelievable. Regardless of the reasons or purposes of these actions, he felt that there was nothing more concerning. Compared to the Italian-Ethiopian War, the Italian-Ethiopian conflict was a minor matter. We must consider the Italian-Ethiopian dispute in light of German rearmament. He believed that in all circumstances, France's efforts to implement the League of Nations Covenant deserved our fervent recognition. Churchill also said that Germany's re-entry into the League of Nations was the most precious goal that Britain had strived to achieve. He was confident that Britain would never engage in another war that contradicted the League of Nations Covenant. Therefore, if the British Empire had to defend itself, then British imperialism and League of Nations principles would be one and the same, not two separate things. He expressed sympathy for Ethiopia's invasion, but since Ethiopia had appealed to the League of Nations, the League should manage its affairs, so that the League would not be accused of favoring one side against Italy. The League of Nations is still alive and active, which is a new and significant development in the international situation. The League of Nations is currently fighting for its survival and almost for the survival of us all. Fifty nations have reaffirmed public law, which is a memorable event for us. What is particularly noteworthy is Mussolini's compliance with sanctions and maintaining contact with the League of Nations, which is a sign of the Italian Prime Minister's breadth of mind and one of the Italian Prime Minister's strongest achievements. The League of Nations has now moved from shadow to substance, from empty talk to practice. Its structure was magnificent and splendid before, but in reality, it had only form without substance. Today, it has power covering its body. We are gradually realizing that the League of Nations will one day bless the world with an even stronger and safer plan. He asked the House of Commons not to think that the current sanctions plan was not severe enough. We cannot take a short-sighted view of the next one or two months. Who knows, in a year, hundreds of thousands of Italian troops might be deeply entrenched in Ethiopia, and rapidly die from disease and guerrilla warfare. Italy is now bleeding from every pore under the world's boycott and condemnation. Gold reserves are dwindling, prices are rising, and credit is failing. How can it last for long? No matter how difficult and dangerous, only those who persevere will ultimately win. We must quickly secure a safe and lasting control of the Mediterranean. Former Health Minister Greenwood then spoke, accusing the government of using international issues to divert the public's attention, so that the public would no longer pay attention to the government's failed unemployment relief policies. Simon rose to conclude the debate, only mentioning one thing regarding international events, saying that a strange message had been sent out this morning, claiming that London, Paris, and Rome now had a scheme to submit a fait accompli to the League of Nations, which would harm the interests of one party and violate the principles of the League of Nations. It is important to know that this accusation is completely false. We are not now running counter to the League of Nations, and have never had the idea of doing so. We also do not want to abandon our collective obligations under the League of Nations Covenant. We certainly hope for a quick and complete solution, but this solution must not fall outside the scope of the League of Nations structure and must be acceptable to both Italy and Ethiopia and the League of Nations itself. Simon continued to speak about domestic affairs and said that British exports to Italy had decreased, not due to sanctions, but due to the Italians' lack of financial resources. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<h3>Parliament Dissolved, Awaiting Re-election; The King Personally Delivers Address; Deeply Regrets That Peace Efforts Failed to Avert War; Expresses Satisfaction That Domestic Economy Is Gradually Moving Towards Prosperity</h3>
<p>(London) This morning at 11:00, the House of Lords and the House of Commons held their last meeting. No official business was conducted. Members of the House of Commons were then summoned to the House of Lords to respectfully listen to the King's address regarding the dissolution of Parliament, which read in part: This year marks the 25th anniversary of my reign, and I and the Queen will always remember this as one of the happiest anniversaries. The expressions of loyalty and love from all sides are unforgettable. The Prime Ministers of the Dominions and the representatives of India were welcomed by me to participate in the celebrations. My relations with foreign countries continue to be friendly. Unfortunately, events occurred between Italy and Ethiopia, to which I have paid the greatest attention. Since the border conflict occurred in East Africa last December, my government has done its utmost, either individually or together with the member states of the League of Nations, to promote a peaceful resolution. It is a matter of regret to me that all these efforts ultimately failed to prevent the use of force. However, my government still faithfully supports the League of Nations' plan to restore peace and establish a friendly resolution in the spirit of the Covenant. I have approved the Act regarding the future political systems of India and Burma. This Act will surely be one of the most important and complex projects that Parliament has ever handled in the records of both houses. When this Act is implemented in the future, it will not only bring comfort and happiness to the people of India and Burma but will also make the friendly relations between India and Burma and other parts of my Empire even closer. As for domestic affairs, the gradual recovery of industry, the increase in national income, and the effectiveness of financial management have created a great progress towards prosperity. My government is now able to exempt the additional taxes imposed four years ago, and can provide full relief to small taxpayers, which is a source of satisfaction to me. It is also pleasing to me that the number of unemployed has gradually decreased over the past year. Although there are various unfavorable conditions in the position of international trade, our country's overseas trade is still expanding, and business is particularly prosperous with other parts of my Empire and countries that have concluded commercial treaties. My government is constantly striving to conclude international agreements to limit various armaments, but it now feels the need to expand the air force to strengthen our defenses, and the implementation process is now underway. After the address was read, Parliament was adjourned. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<h3>Italy Uses Radio to Conduct Anti-British Propaganda in the Near East; London Lodges Representations</h3>
<p>(London) Recently, the Italian radio station has been broadcasting anti-British propaganda to the Arab and Muslim peoples in the Near East. When the House of Commons met today, a member asked the government about this matter. Overseas Dominions Secretary Thomas replied that the government had made representations to the Italian government on this matter and that Britain would soon establish a radio broadcasting station in Palestine. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<h3>Amidst the Italian-Ethiopian War, There is Talk of a Franco-German Rapprochement</h3>
<p>(Paris) The complex situation of the Italian-Ethiopian peace agreement and the internal political situation in France has been further complicated today by talk of a Franco-German rapprochement. Paris *Echo* columnist Bertin and *Volffre* reporter Tapia both stated today that France recently had an informal representative visit German leader Hitler. Bertin also said that Hitler was quite indifferent to Franco-German friendship, because of all the countries, Hitler would rather have friendly relations with Britain. Tapia stated that Hitler's personal representative, Liedrohof, may come to France in the future. (Guomin, 24th)</p>

<h3>No War on Eastern Front; Ethiopian Troops Once Attacked the Aduwa Right Flank; Italian Aircraft Reconnoitered 3,000 Miles of the Northern Route</h3>
<p>(Rome) The Propaganda Department issued its 27th bulletin, stating that there was no war on the Tigray province and Wogga-Dan front in Ethiopia. Ethiopian natives have been flocking to the Italian army, so Italian outposts have been able to advance along the Adigrat-Adua and Aksum lines. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa  An unconfirmed report received here today states that Italian forces are advancing northwest towards Walwal, aiming for the town of Sassabane, 140 miles from Harar. It is said that the Italian objective is to cut off several central garrison points by encircling the Ethiopian army's lines. This includes Gora Hai, an Ethiopian communication hub. They also aim to break through the enemy lines from the rear. Another report states that tens of thousands of soldiers are gathering in valleys and passes, waiting to resist the Italian army led by Graziani. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa  Thousands of Ethiopian troops marched north today, preparing for a decisive battle, which is expected to occur soon. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to dispatches from Asmara, Eritrea, Ethiopian forces under General Seyoum attacked the Italian right flank on the Aduwa line today but were repulsed. General Seyoum is now withdrawing his troops to the Chila River, a tributary of the Tekeze River. Italian vanguards on the southern front are halting the Ethiopian advance in Mai Tzehel. According to Ethiopian prisoners, the Ethiopian forces on that front are awaiting reinforcements from Addis Ababa before launching a general offensive. It is reported that the reinforcements have two bomber aircraft. Today, a public statement claimed that Italian reserve forces have occupied the village of Galafó, a major neutral point in the Shilille area on the southern front. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>Asmara  Major Barnes, a Reuters correspondent accompanying Count Ciano, Mussolini's son-in-law, and his squadron of aircraft, sent a cable today detailing the Italian aircraft's reconnaissance of enemy troops over 3,000 miles of the northern front. It was reported that an Ethiopian machine gun squad was spotted in a certain area. The aircraft flew to within a few hundred feet of the ground and strafed the Ethiopian troops with machine gun fire. The Ethiopian troops also returned fire with machine guns, but none of the Italian aircraft were damaged. The main purpose of the Italian aircraft's reconnaissance was to determine the location of General Seyoum's troops, but no large gatherings of Ethiopian soldiers were seen. Therefore, the location of the enemy's main force has not yet been discovered. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>Harar  According to a cable from our correspondent La Foya, Ethiopian regular troops, trained by Belgian instructors, have recently departed from Qiqiqa City (east of Harar) for the Wogga-Dan area. General Nasibu, the governor of Harar province and commander-in-chief of the southern front, has also departed for Qiqiqa City, where he will establish his headquarters to command the southern military operations. Before the departure of these troops, General Nasibu personally reviewed them. This was greatly welcomed by the local people. This is an elite Ethiopian force, including infantry, machine gun squads, and 300 cavalrymen in bright uniforms. In addition, there is a camel corps, which was trained by Belgian instructors in the last six months. Military, political, and religious dignitaries were all present at the review. General Nasibu, fully armed, sat high on a white horse, presenting a remarkable figure. He delivered an enthusiastic speech to the troops. After listening to the speech, the troops marched out of the city in a cloud of dust. Women lined the streets to bid farewell to the soldiers, showering them and their banners with flowers. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa  According to a cable from our correspondent O'Chona, General Gedashu and General Mariam recently led their troops from the Wollega province to the capital, where they are about to depart for the front lines. They were recently reviewed by the Ethiopian Emperor. The troops were making a cacophony of sounds with horns and pipes. A black band played Slavic music. Flags were crossed, indicating the positions of various chieftains. Crowds gathered before the chieftains, cheering and supporting them. However, the troops were not lined up neatly. Officers often struck them with wooden sticks to make them stand at attention and "dress ranks." The Emperor arrived at 11:30 AM to review 40,000 of these old-style soldiers, each carrying different weapons. Although they had been marching for ten days, they showed no signs of fatigue. General Gedashu, smiling, first paid his respects to the Emperor and then addressed the troops, urging his subordinates to be brave and cautious. (Havas, 25th)</p>

<h3>Unrest Among Black Natives on British West Indian Islands; Filled With Resentment Against Italian Aggression</h3>
<p>(London) The Times recently published an article by Sir Bell, stating that "riots have broken out among the black people of St. Vincent, a British island in the West Indies, and are widespread. These riots are likely the result of Italy's aggression against Abyssinia. Since Italy launched its aggression against Abyssinia, everywhere in Africa, in the tents of Nigerian chiefs, in the gatherings of native merchants, in the marketplaces of villages and towns, and in the everyday conversations of Equatorial Africa, this unjust war is being discussed. Previously, the people of [British] colonies deeply believed in the honor and justice of [the British] nation based on all the facts. However, the Italo-Ethiopian affair has caused resentment and deep suspicion in their hearts. It should be understood that collective security is the best principle, but what the world needs most is collective justice." Sir Bell has served as the governor of British colonies in the West Indies, Africa, and the Indian Ocean. (Havas, 25th)</p>

<h3>In the Midst of Calls to Reopen Naval Conference, Britain, the United States, and Japan Hold Divergent Views; US Advocates a 5:5:3 Ratio, Japan Advocates Equality; Britain Wants to Expand the Scope to Include Germany and Russia</h3>
<p>(London) First Lord of the Admiralty Monsell declared in the House of Commons today that the government has sent notes to Washington and the signatory countries of the London Naval Treaty—the United States, France, Italy, and Japan—inquiring whether they would send representatives to the naval conference to be held in London on December 2nd. The purpose of the conference is to strive as much as possible to agree on all matters concerning naval limitations, so as to conclude an international treaty to replace the two naval treaties that will expire at the end of 1936. The government is also consulting with the Dominions on this matter. It is now hoped that representatives from the signatory countries can agree to expand the scope of the conference to allow other naval powers to join. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The State Department officially announced today that the United States has accepted Britain's invitation to send representatives to the London Naval Conference on December 2nd and has sent a cable to U.S. Ambassador to Britain Bingham informing British Foreign Secretary Hoare of this. The original letter of invitation has not yet been received here, but after consulting with Secretary of State Hull and President Roosevelt, the decision was made to accept based on Bingham's cable. It is also understood that the United States will abandon its past policy this time, not sending diplomats as representatives, but appointing Rear Admiral Standley, the head of the Navy Department's Planning Division, who has always advocated a large navy, as the chief representative. Davis, who has represented the United States at international conferences in the past, will not be going to London this time. Standley met with President Roosevelt for about half an hour today. Afterwards, Standley stated that he and the President had discussed the general situation regarding naval issues. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the British government's convening of a disarmament conference, the Japanese government is preparing to consider the selection of representatives. However, recently, the U.S. Secretary of the Navy declared opposition to revising the 5:5:3 ratio, and the British Prime Minister strongly argued for the necessity of supplementing military equipment. France, Italy, and other countries also advocate military expansion. If the disarmament conference proceeds in the face of such pessimistic [views on] disarmament, there must be new proposals to prevent the danger of the conference collapsing. Although Japan will participate in the conference, it will never change its long-held disarmament policy. After receiving the British government's official invitation, it intends to convey this intention to the British government to avoid misunderstandings. (Domei News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The British government's official invitation for a disarmament conference was delivered to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by Chargé d'Affaires Fujii on the 25th. The contents of the invitation are being kept strictly secret. According to reliable sources, the British government did not reveal any specific items on the agenda, but merely stated that the British government has consistently adopted a gentlemanly attitude since the preliminary consultations. Therefore, based on the Washington and London treaties, it will convene a formal conference in London starting on December 2nd. The conference is intended to establish a fair and appropriate new international treaty to replace the two old treaties of Washington and London. It also needs to consult with all parties as much as possible on naval limitation issues in order to achieve its objectives. If there is hope of reaching an agreement with the countries concerned, other countries will also be invited. Regarding the composition of the delegation, it is only hoped that the organization will be small. However, the circumstances regarding the country's proposed declaration of autonomous shipbuilding and the use of qualitative restrictions as the basis of the conference were not mentioned.

<h3>The Secret Plotting of the Rebel Riot</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to people from Xianghe, the rebellion in Xianghe was initiated by rebel leaders An Houqi and Wu Yiting. An and others had previously been living in Beiping. On the 15th, they went from Beiping to Xianghe. At An Houzhai's home in Lingzi Village, outside the east gate of the county, they gathered more than 20 ronin to secretly plot the riot. Starting on the 16th, they held meetings day and night at Hu Chengwu's home in Anfu Fuzhai. On the 20th, they gathered more than 1,000 ignorant villagers outside the city, intending to enter the city. On the 21st, the rebels sent six representatives, including three ronin and three Chinese—Chen Zhiru, Cao Fuqing, and Zhang Yizhai—into the city to demand the county magistrate Zhao's seal. They were driven out. The ronin were temporarily detained at the Chengxing Shop on South Main Street of the county government, and the Chinese Chen Zhiru, etc., were detained at the Kuishun Inn. The Japanese Embassy's military police heard the news and sent more than 20 military police, led by Captain Otaki, to arrive at Yihe on the night of the 22nd. The four gates of the county were closed and sandbags were piled up to prevent the rioters from attacking the city. When the military police entered the city through the west gate that day, they took the three ronin. At the same time, the three Chinese also disappeared. The rebels, seeing that the Japanese military police had entered the city, opened the city gate and poured into the city, completely robbing the Public Security Bureau's police and firearms. Bai Zhichun, the head of the Public Security Bureau, and squad leader Liu Chen, etc., jumped off the wall of Kuixing [Inn] in Dongguan in an attempt to escape.

<h3>Eurasia Aviation Corporation's Junkers Aircraft: Second Plane Arrived in Shanghai Last Night, Took Off from Berlin on the 31st of Last Month, Longhua Airport Made Initial Trial of Night Flight Equipment, the Aircraft Decided to Join the Shanghai-Chengdu Air Route</h3>
<p>The second JU52 Junkers aircraft ordered by Eurasia Aviation Corporation from the German Lufthansa took off from Berlin on the 31st of last month. On the 6th, when landing in Rangoon, the landing gear was damaged. After repairs were completed, it continued its flight from Rangoon the day before yesterday and landed in Hanoi that night. It continued its flight from Hanoi yesterday morning and arrived at Shanghai's Longhua Airport at 6:45 PM. Ms. Zhu Qingmu presented flowers, and General Manager Li Jingcong delivered a welcome speech. A grand banquet is scheduled for tonight. The aircraft will fly on the Shanghai-Chengdu route. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>From Germany to Shanghai</p>
<p>The second Junkers aircraft was piloted by five people: Kaspap, the renowned German pilot and captain, Mayer, the co-pilot, Schnlidr, the mechanic, Falipebarucb, the radio operator, and Schiller, the radio engineer. It took off from Berlin, Germany, on the 31st of last month. When landing in Rangoon on the 6th, the aircraft's landing gear sank into the soft mud of the airport and was damaged. After repairs, it finally completed the work the day before yesterday and continued flying, landing in Hanoi that night. Because the airport there was small, the landing gear sank into the mud again. After finding a way to get it out, fortunately the landing gear was not damaged. It left Hanoi yesterday morning and landed in Hong Kong at 12:00 noon. It left Hong Kong for Shanghai at 2:30 PM.</p>
<p>Airport Equipment</p>
<p>After Eurasia Aviation Corporation received a telegram from Hong Kong reporting the aircraft's status, knowing that the plane would not arrive in Shanghai until 7:00 PM, they specifically opened the searchlights and all night flight equipment previously installed at Longhua Airport for the Nanjing-Shanghai night route. More than a dozen gasoline lamps and reflectors were temporarily installed. The German flag and party flag were hung inside the northeast corner of the civilian houses at the field, and the Republic of China flag and party flag were hung at the entrance. Champagne was placed in the middle. The Municipal Public Security Bureau dispatched more than a dozen armed police officers to maintain strict security at the airport.</p>
<p>Welcoming Personnel</p>
<p>Those who went to Longhua Airport last night to welcome the aircraft included: Mr. Fu Kai'er, President of the German Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Si De Ci, representative of the Junkers factory stationed in Shanghai, Mr. Shi Tuo Ke, representative of Lufthansa stationed in Shanghai, Mr. Bo Lu Xun, General Manager of Xiangbao Postal Ship Company, Li Jingcong, Manager of Eurasia Aviation Corporation, Liao Guanxuan, German Secretary, He En, Acting Head of the Aircraft Navigation Group, and more than fifty reporters from Chinese and foreign newspapers. Senior company staff were responsible for hospitality. All welcoming personnel arrived at Longhua Airport before 5:30 PM. When the initial telegram was received from Hong Kong, it was reported that the plane would take off at 12:00 noon and was expected to arrive in Shanghai at 5:30 PM. A later telegram indicated that the departure was changed to 2:30 PM, but there was not enough time to notify the welcoming personnel.</p>
<p>Lights Shining</p>
<p>At 6:15 PM yesterday afternoon, Longhua Airport continuously launched rockets (i.e., signals) inside the field. At the same time, the searchlights were turned on to allow the aircraft to see them from afar, indicating that it was an airport. At 6:45 PM, the sound of an aircraft was suddenly heard at the field. All welcomers looked up and saw that the aircraft was in the air above the airport. Only a large green light could be seen on the right wing. After circling the field once, the aircraft descended. A car dispatched by Eurasia Corporation led the way to the front of the field before stopping. The aircraft was silver-gray, with the large characters (DAges) painted on the fuselage, exactly the same as the first aircraft.</p>
<p>Group Presented Flowers</p>
<p>All welcoming personnel went to the front of the plane. Kaspap, the captain, and Mayer, the co-pilot, and the other five people disembarked one after another. Miss Zhu Qingmu presented flowers and shook hands with the welcoming personnel one by one. General Manager Li Jingquan stepped forward to welcome the pilots and accompanied them to the inside of the reception area, where champagne was served, and a welcome speech was given. At the same time, the welcomers applauded. It ended at 7:20 PM.</p>
<p>Li's Speech</p>
<p>Li Jingcong, General Manager of Eurasia Aviation Corporation, delivered a welcome speech, saying, "Ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to take this opportunity, in the name of Eurasia Aviation Corporation, to express my most sincere welcome to the flight crew of the JU52 aircraft that has just flown to Shanghai. As you all know, we want to conquer the skies between Europe and Asia. Based on the fact that silver aircraft have repeatedly flown directly from Berlin to Shanghai in the past year, we sincerely hope that air transportation between Europe and Asia can be realized in the near future. This is the task we are responsible for, and it is the goal we are striving for. Your arrival has reopened the road of air transportation between Europe and Asia. I can very well use the words of the old Roman general and loudly proclaim, 'You came, you saw, you helped us break through all the obstacles to air transportation between Europe and Asia.' Now, I request everyone to join me in congratulating the flight crew of the Dages aircraft and to wish them good health." The speech was then translated by the German secretary, Liao Huanxuan.</p>
<p>Banquet Tonight</p>
<p>Captain Kaspap and the other five people stayed at the International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road last night. Eurasia Aviation Corporation is scheduled to hold a grand banquet at 7:00 PM today, probably at the Xinghua Restaurant on Fuzhou Road. Chinese and Western directors of the company, personnel from the German embassy and chamber of commerce, and representatives of Lufthansa Junkers stationed in Shanghai will be invited to attend. It is heard that after the pilots send the aircraft to Eurasia Corporation, they will return to Germany by boat. When they arrived in Shanghai last night, they also brought a personal letter from Lufthansa to Li Jingcong, General Manager of Eurasia Aviation Corporation.</p>
<p>Joining the Air Route</p>
<p>The aircraft is equipped with three engines and is fully equipped. In the future, it will join the Shanghai-Xinjiang and Shaanxi-Chengdu routes, passing through Shanghai, Nanjing, Zhengzhou, Xi'an, Hanzhong, Chengdu, and other places. Flights will depart from Shanghai every Tuesday and Friday and from Chengdu every Wednesday and Saturday.</p>

<h3>National Labor Representative Secretary Zhang Daomin Returned to China Yesterday, Examined the Current State of Labor and Rural Economy in Various Countries, Also Expressed Opinions on China's Labor Organization</h3>
<p>Shanghai News Agency reports that Wang Jinxia, the labor representative attending the International Labor Conference on behalf of China, has already returned to the country. Secretary Zhang Daomin, after visiting various countries to investigate the state of labor and rural economy, returned to China yesterday aboard the Nagasaki Maru. A reporter from the Shanghai News Agency paid a special visit to Mr. Zhang at the New Asia Hotel. According to the interview, the details are as follows:</p>
<p>Investigation Process</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang went abroad with the National Labor Representative on May 10. On June 4, he attended the International Labor Conference. After the closing on the 26th, he went to Italy, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, France, Poland, Russia, Japan, and other countries to investigate the current state of labor and rural economy. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Japan aboard the Nagasaki Maru. The details of the International Labor Conference have already been reported and published, so they were not discussed.</p>
<p>Conditions in Various Countries</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang first stated that the labor conditions in European countries have already been put on track, especially in the United Kingdom and France. British industry is developed, with a history of more than 80 years. In Germany, all workers, from young to old, if they can work, do not have to worry about not having food to eat. Their labor insurance system is handled very well. The German labor policy is based on the labor front, where labor and capital are integrated. Even under economic panic, there are very few unemployed people, and those who are unemployed can still live, so they can restore economic prosperity. Italy is on the road to labor freedom and labor welfare. Their organization has professional associations, but the welfare of workers is obtained under the interests of the country. Without the interests of the country, the welfare of workers cannot be discussed. The labor situation in Russia is similar to that in Germany, but the system is different. In terms of agriculture, the agricultural cooperation in the Netherlands and the collective farms in Russia have achieved considerable success.</p>
<p>Zhang's Opinion</p>
<p>Compared with Western Europe, China is of course very far behind. However, to seek economic prosperity and industrial development, it is necessary to start from the labor aspect, and China's mechanical workers and agricultural workers cannot be separated. China's economic foundation should be based on agricultural labor, and to obtain the effect of agricultural labor, it is necessary to use agricultural cooperation methods and have a whole plan to organize it. Therefore, China's labor movement must have a new organization in the future, under the overall interests of the country, so that labor and capital can be integrated to obtain true labor interests, he said.</p>
<h3>Qian Dajun Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday, Said That It Is Not Difficult to Annihilate the Remaining Bandits</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that Central Committee Member Qian Dajun arrived in Shanghai by train from Beijing yesterday morning at 7:15 am, accompanied by his wife, Ouyang. Mr. Qian came to Shanghai to handle private affairs. With the Sixth Plenary Session approaching, he is scheduled to return to Beijing at the end of the month to attend. According to Mr. Qian, regarding the recent news of bandit suppression, there are no bandit traces in Hubei province except for a very small number of scattered bandits in southern Hubei. As for the Xiao Ke He Long faction on the border of Hunan and Hubei, the headquarters is currently coordinating the suppression. Although Liu Zidan and Xu Haidong in northern Shaanxi have joined forces, they can be resolved soon. After Zhu, Mao, and Xu Xiangqian in Sichuan joined forces, they have now split again. The Peng Dehuai faction has less than 3,000 people and is currently fleeing into Gansu province. The Zhu Mao factions are still entrenched near Aba. The campaign headquarters is planning the suppression. In short, the bandits now have nothing to rely on and it is not difficult to annihilate them, he said.</p>

<p>Zhang Qun, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, Ju Zheng, President of the Judicial Yuan, Gu Mengyu, Minister of Railways, and Liu Weizhi, Vice Minister of Industry, and others, took the night train from Beijing last night and are expected to arrive at 7:15 am this morning.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Communications Pays Attention to Aviation Equipment</h3>
<p>In order to facilitate air transportation, the Ministry of Communications is paying close attention to aviation equipment. It recently issued the following instructions to China National Aviation Corporation: (1) Wireless radio direction finders are necessary for blind flying. The company has not yet universally installed this equipment at important stations, which is not sufficient to ensure flight safety. The company is hereby ordered to promptly install the above-mentioned instruments extensively to facilitate air transportation. This is of utmost importance. (2) Meteorological equipment is extremely important for aviation safety. The company's meteorological observation equipment is only simple equipment, which is not sufficient to meet the needs. How to control the national meteorological agencies so that they can all make aviation meteorological reports to facilitate navigation is currently being handled by the Ministry in consultation with the Aviation Committee. Before the unified method is determined, the company should select important locations on all routes passing through heavy mountains and sea areas with unstable climates and quickly add radio stations and meteorological equipment to facilitate communication and ensure safety. In addition to separate orders, the company is hereby ordered to comply and report accordingly.</p>

It was decided to dispatch the ship from Lao Yao quickly to tow the distressed vessel. After the agreement, a telegram was immediately sent to the captain of the Hai Rui to speed up the voyage. A reply telegram was also sent to the captain of the Xin Feng, awaiting the Hai Rui's rescue. According to Zhao Yuntai, chief of the shipping department, the Xin Feng is expected to be safely towed back to Shanghai by the Hai Rui and there should be no unexpected major risks.</p>

<h3>County Districts Report on Crop Failure Due to Disasters</h3>
<p>The cotton and rice crops planted in the agricultural lands of Shanghai County's districts have suffered damage from wind and rain, as well as insect infestations, resulting in crop failure. The County Assets Office and other departments had previously submitted reports to the provincial authorities. Now, according to reports submitted by all district chiefs of the county to the county government, this year's autumn harvest is generally no more than 60% of normal. They requested relief to alleviate the people's hardship. County Magistrate Ye, after reviewing the reports, submitted the county's disaster situation to the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Civil Affairs and Finance Departments for review and instructions on how to proceed.</p>
<h3>China International Famine Relief Commission Launches Xie Andao Memorial Fund</h3>
<p>Mr. Xie Andao, born in California, USA, was dispatched to the Chinese National Council of YMCAs by the YMCA of New York in 1905 to report on its work. He has been working in China for nearly 30 years. He founded the YMCAs in Chengdu and Chongqing. In the past two years, he served as the chief secretary of the Shanghai office of the China International Famine Relief Commission. Unfortunately, he fell ill in July of this year and passed away on September 29 despite medical treatment. His will stipulated that funeral arrangements should be simple and that any condolence money from relatives and friends should be used for disaster relief and donated to the China International Famine Relief Commission for collection. The National Association of Chinese Christian Youth Associations, recognizing Xie's long service and significant contributions to the association, allocated 5,000 yuan to the China International Famine Relief Commission for disaster relief in accordance with his will to fulfill his wishes. His relatives and friends also donated condolence money, totaling over 300 yuan, which the commission has received. Therefore, the commission, in memory of Xie, launched the Xie Andao Memorial Fund. The executive committee of the China International Famine Relief Commission resolved that the memorial fund would be used for loans to provide relief for water and drought disasters, as well as to improve agricultural industries, but the principal of the fund should not be used. The fund will be entrusted to the Yangtze River Basin Rehabilitation Commission for safekeeping. Xie's concern for disaster victims in our country and the fulfillment of Xie's lifelong aspiration by his relatives and friends are commendable. Given Xie's wide circle of friends, there will surely be continuing contributions to comfort Xie's spirit and save the lives of disaster victims, truly achieving both aims at once.</p>
<h3>Water Disaster Relief Association Commemorates Zhang Zepu</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Association for Raising Funds for Water Disaster Relief in Various Provinces received a report from Li Du, the magistrate of Yude County, Anhui, regarding Zhang Zepu, the former deputy director of drought investigation and relief, requesting a commendation. The report states, "According to the report from Lin Jinwen, permanent committee member of the disaster relief committee of our county, Dong Yutian, chairman of the finance committee, Jin Zhaonan, chairman of the chamber of commerce, Zhu Xuecheng, staff member of the farmers' association, Ji Fatang, staff member of the education association, etc., Mr. Zhang Zepu, the deputy director of the Anhui Investigation and Relief Office of the Shanghai Association for Raising Funds for Drought Disaster Relief in Various Provinces, has been handling relief matters for thirty years. During the recent major disasters in our province, he personally went to provide relief, conducting thorough investigations and providing assistance, saving countless lives. His actions have been repeatedly praised by superiors, and the facts are well documented and need no further elaboration. Last year, our county suffered from both drought and bandits, and the local economy was severely damaged. This summer, we suffered from flood disaster again, and most of the county became a flooded area. Fields and crops were submerged, and houses were washed away. Dozens of villages were without smoke from cooking fires, and hundreds of households had no grain. Director Zhang, together with Director Wang Ganshi and other staff members, came to our county last winter under orders, bringing funds to provide relief for pregnant women affected by the drought. He personally went to the disaster areas to conduct on-site investigations and provide assistance. Our disaster victims were suddenly showered with the water of compassion, and the parched lands were revived. Recalling the great kindness of the assistance, we are deeply grateful. Moreover, Zhang Gong also saw that there was not enough food for everyone and that it was difficult to continue. He taught us to thoroughly provide disaster relief, leaving no effort unspent. He then founded a porridge kitchen without using fire, personally traveling to Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai to appeal for help, raising huge sums of money over a period of ten days. He did not mind the hardship of traveling, and he personally took out money from his own pocket for travel expenses. If he were not generous and righteous, how could he be so enthusiastic? It goes without saying that the distribution of relief to the disaster areas and the investigation and assistance were thorough. Moreover, the staff members he brought were able to risk traveling through dangerous bandit areas, cooperating with local people to conduct on-site investigations. Therefore, all the refugees in the disaster areas received real benefits and praised his efforts. This summer, the flood victims in our county suffered even more than during the major flood of 1931. Director Zhang saw the severity of the disaster and the cries of the refugees. He discussed with you and tried his best to raise money and borrow food, as well as various medicines, and ventured into the raging waves, providing food and comfort to the awaiting people. He braved the sun and the heat, and the sweat soaked his back. He did not avoid any hardship and provided ten days of emergency relief, bringing the people to safety. This is what is meant by saving people from a well, not caring about anything else. Unexpectedly, while traveling on a boat with a red head, he was injured in his right arm while circumventing the water around the mountains. The pain was deep, but he avoided seeking medical treatment and continued to inspect the disaster area despite his illness. We were planning to submit a request for praise to highlight his merits, but heaven was unforgiving. Zhang Gong suddenly passed away in Beijing at the end of August due to a serious illness. When the bad news arrived, all the disaster victims in the county mourned deeply. In addition to sending a special telegram of condolences and a telegram to the Central Relief Committee to request the National Government to provide generous compensation, we respectfully submit the facts of Zhang Gong's relief efforts, to the best of our knowledge, and briefly describe his good deeds throughout his life. We are deeply grateful for his righteousness and are saddened by his poverty after his death. How will his family survive? We jointly present this document, requesting your approval and submission to the Anhui Provincial Government to grant generous compensation to comfort his spirit and ensure the well-being of his surviving family members. Based on this, after reviewing the statements made by the committee members, it is found that all the facts are accurate. We respectfully submit this document, and in addition to submitting it to the Anhui Provincial Government, we respectfully request your review and approval to grant generous compensation to comfort his spirit and ensure the well-being of his surviving family members, which would be a virtuous act." This matter was raised at the fourth joint meeting of the standing directors and supervisors of the association yesterday. It was reported that the official had been handling relief efforts for many years and had worked diligently and made outstanding achievements. He sacrificed his life for relief work, which is deeply regrettable and mourned. After joint discussion, it was decided that in addition to the Central Relief Committee providing generous compensation in accordance with regulations, the Drought Disaster Relief Association would provide a one-time compensation of 500 yuan, and the Flood Disaster Relief Association would provide a one-time compensation of 300 yuan to encourage and show compassion. Mr. Zhang Xiaolin, director of the review committee of the association, who happened to be present at the meeting that day, generously donated 200 national currency yuan to support Zhang's orphaned children. Such kindness and righteousness are not only appreciated by Zhang, both living and dead, but also admired by all people. Such excellent compassion for those who have worked hard and diligently in disaster relief is enough to encourage others.</p>
<h3>Relief Efforts of the China International Famine Relief Commission</h3>
<p>The China International Famine Relief Commission on Renji Road believes that the water disaster is most severe in northern Jiangsu. Following the major drought, it established a branch in Peixian, Xuzhou, and successively allocated 12,000 yuan in relief funds and medicines for emergency relief. However, the Yellow River overflowed to the south, and although the current situation has gradually stabilized, the disaster area has expanded, the number of refugees has increased, and the tragic situation is rare. Moreover, autumn is already deep and the weather is cold, so relief is urgently needed. An additional relief office was established in Yaowan, Pizhou, to supplement the areas that are not being assisted. The areas of Haizhou have also suffered greatly. Because of the difficulty in providing comprehensive assistance, the commission is working with the Jisheng Society and is allocating funds to transport clothing. The emergency relief to various disaster-stricken counties in Shandong was previously overseen by Director Lu Bohong. A branch has since been established in Jining, and a total of 50,000 yuan in relief funds has been allocated to the various counties as follows: Dongping 10,000 yuan, Juancheng 10,000 yuan, Yutai 13,000 yuan, Yuncheng and Shouzhang 5,000 yuan each, Juye and Heze 2,500 yuan each, and Jinxiang 2,000 yuan. It is also reported that the commission believes that while emergency relief is crucial for saving lives, the water disaster has left many people without a thread of clothing, so clothing is especially necessary. The commission has first produced 15,000 sets of cotton clothing, which will be shipped to Jiangsu and Shandong as soon as the procedures for free transportation are completed to meet the urgent need. As for the Yangtze River relief efforts, in addition to the initial emergency relief to the Tianmen disaster area, 7,000 yuan has been allocated and jointly distributed with the Jisheng Society. However, the area is too large, so another 20,000 yuan has been allocated and is being carried out in conjunction with the Red Swastika Society. Over sixty boxes of clothing sent by overseas Chinese and local organizations in Shanghai have also been transported for distribution. Secondly, 20,000 yuan has been allocated to the disaster area in Hunan, and Director Lu Bohong is responsible for supervising the distribution by the local branch. Furthermore, 5,000 yuan has been allocated to Fujian Province and handed over to the Quanzhou Chinese and Western Committee for handling. In Guangdong Province, 5,000 yuan will be allocated to Sihui and Guangning for targeted relief. The commission has recently received over 12,000 yuan from overseas Chinese in the United States, over 14,000 yuan from various places in Nanyang, 24 boxes of old clothes, 16 boxes of old clothes from the Philippines, 38 bags, over 10,000 yuan from various great philanthropists, 1,000 bottles of Supreme Oil from the Supreme Company, and 1,000 bottles of Shidi Shui (Ten Drops Water) from Mr. Yang Jifang.</p>
<h3>Exemption from Taxes for Land Requisitioned for River Dredging in County Districts</h3>
<p>The land survey in various districts of Shanghai County has been completed. However, as the agricultural slack season approaches, each district must requisition labor to dredge rivers. The farmland along the rivers will inevitably have to be requisitioned, which will affect the payment of taxes on the already surveyed land. Therefore, after discussion at yesterday's land consolidation meeting, it was decided that when land along rivers is requisitioned for dredging, the land bureau should survey and revise the maps, and a request should be submitted to the county government to exempt the requisitioned land from taxes.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Chengdu Express Flight Schedule Changes</h3>
<p>China National Aviation Corporation's special express flight between Shanghai and Chengdu, which arrives on the same day, was previously announced to fly to Chengdu on Tuesdays and Fridays and return to Shanghai on Wednesdays and Saturdays. It is now scheduled to change from Monday, October 28th, to fly from Shanghai to Chengdu on Mondays and Thursdays and return from Chengdu to Shanghai on Tuesdays and Fridays, with both round trips arriving on the same day.</p>
<h3>Opening of the Vietnam National Products Exhibition</h3>
<p>Huang Jianzhong, a member of the organizing committee of the Overseas Chinese Federation, recently received a telegram from Yan Zijun, chairman of the Vietnam National Products Exhibition, stating that the Singapore National Products Exhibition is about to close. In order to achieve twice the result with half the effort, the association has sent two representatives, Lei Jianqing and Liang Bozhi, to Singapore to discuss with the exhibiting manufacturers the possibility of exhibiting in Vietnam. The manufacturers have agreed, and it has been decided to ship the goods to Vietnam on the 27th of this month and hold the opening ceremony on November 5th. Mr. Huang and Bai Hongji are requested to serve as representatives of the association in Shanghai and to contact manufacturers in Shanghai as soon as possible. Manufacturers who wish to participate in the exhibition in Vietnam must ship their goods before the 5th. All preferential procedures will be handled in accordance with the Singapore model. Huang Jianzhong, after receiving the telegram, is concerned that there may not be enough time for manufacturers in Shanghai to prepare and participate. He plans to contact national product organizations in Shanghai to discuss solutions or to telegraph Vietnam to request a postponement of the exhibition.</p>
<h3>Emerging National Waterproofing Products for Cement Buildings</h3>
<p>In recent years, China's construction industry has been developing rapidly. Regarding design issues, such as high-rise buildings, not only have they become magnificent and spectacular, but the dryness and brightness of the interior are also of great importance to health and hygiene, as well as to all properties. If the walls and floors are invaded by dampness, wind, and rain, causing them to be unable to dry quickly, all properties and health will suffer greatly. Various countries have long been studying waterproofing projects in order to preserve the safety of the interior. The Jianye Trading Company has hired chemical experts to invent Jianye Waterproofing Powder. After the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association and Caojia Garden in Caohejing have used it for building waterproofing projects, it has proven to be greatly effective and has achieved great success. It is now sold throughout the country and is praised by all sectors. For building construction projects such as houses, cellars, pools, water towers, bridge piles, dams, and swimming pools, using Jianye Waterproofing Powder can guarantee special effects, far superior to imported products and much better than oil felt. When purchasing, stating that you were referred by the Chinese Institute of Engineers can get considerable discounts.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Branch of the National Bank of Hong Kong Opens Debt Registration Yesterday, but Bondholders Oppose Liquidation</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Shanghai, October 25th. The liquidation office of the Shanghai branch of the National Bank of Hong Kong began registering debts today. Many people went to register, accounting for half of the total debt amount. The office printed letters inquiring whether creditors agreed to the bank's re-establishment after liquidation. Almost all of those who signed agreed. All of the creditors in Hong Kong agreed to the re-establishment. Yesterday, the office received a telegram from the representative of the Hong Kong creditors, stating that a second meeting of all the bank's creditors would be convened within three weeks to discuss the re-establishment. It is also reported that the liquidation office will also convene a meeting of the Shanghai branch's creditors within two or three weeks to discuss the issue.</p>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports: The bondholders of the Shanghai branch of the National Bank of Hong Kong have specially hired lawyer Liang Yaobing to announce their opposition to the liquidation and petition the court to declare the bank bankrupt. The announcement is as follows: "According to the above-mentioned creditors, after reading various newspaper advertisements and seeing three news items about the liquidation of the Shanghai branch of the National Bank of Hong Kong, they were extremely surprised. It was found that Chu Zhongqing was originally the general manager of the bank's various branches, and the other liquidators were absolutely interested parties of the bank. The liquidation by them is not in accordance with human sentiments and the law and is prone to abuses. The creditors are afraid that their claims will be infringed upon and, in order to protect their legal interests, they will petition the court to declare the bank bankrupt and request the appointment of a bankruptcy administrator. The court is currently awaiting a decision. Please publish an objection. All creditors should listen to the court's decision to avoid losing their claims."</p>

<h3>Nine-Year-Old Grandson, Shan Cheng, Kidnapped, Held in Bandit's Lair for Over Eighty Days, Safe Return Reveals Lively Child Without Abnormalities, Kidnappers Demand Exorbitant Ransom of 500,000 Yuan, Male and Female Kidnappers Interrogated and Awaiting Scheduled Sentencing</h3>
<p>Sun Cailing, a 40-year-old native of Dinghai, Zhejiang, residing at No. 344, Lane 3, Beile Road in the French Concession, and working in the banking industry, had a beloved nine-year-old son named Shan Cheng. On the afternoon of August 5th of this year, Shan Cheng went to play at the home of Sun's younger brother, Sun Caizhang, nearby and suddenly disappeared. At the same time, the maid of the Zhang household, Yu Tang, also known as Cai Xian or Genhua, from Shaoxing, was also missing. As the family was in a state of panic, Sun found a letter in his home that had been slipped in from the outside. The letter stated that his son had been kidnapped and demanded an overseas ransom of 500,000 yuan, instructing him to contact them at a certain location for negotiations. Only then did they realize that the child had been abducted by kidnappers. They immediately reported it to the police, requesting investigation and arrest. The Chinese and Western detectives of the French Concession police department went out in all directions to gather clues and apprehend the kidnappers. It was not until September 12th that they arrested the kidnappers' accomplices, Ying Caifang (44 years old) from Shaoxing, Wang Wenhua (also known as Fenghuang's eldest son, 35 years old), Chen Genlin (45 years old), a woman named Chen Tang (also known as Tu Xian, 32 years old, and sister of the maid Yu Tang who disappeared at the same time as the hostage), Zhang Xiaofu (40 years old, a carpenter residing at No. 218 Wangzhi Road), and five other men and women. They then proceeded to Hangzhou to arrest Wang Baoshan (56 years old) from Shaoxing and brought him to Shanghai to be jointly escorted to the Second Special District Court.</p>
<p>The investigation and detention were carried out according to regulations. The whereabouts of the hostage were unknown at the time of the investigation, so the matter was kept secret and not disclosed. Later, the arrested suspect Ying Caifang died of illness while in custody. Although the Second Special Court held several hearings, led by Judge Zhang Chaozuo, the defendants all shirked responsibility and denied involvement in the kidnapping. As a result, it was difficult to obtain any clues about the whereabouts of the hostage. The French Concession police continued to investigate rigorously, but still found no leads. The case was originally scheduled for a retrial by the court. Yesterday, appointed lawyer Bian Kuang was summoned to court for further questioning. On the morning of the day before yesterday (the 24th), at 7:30 AM, the plaintiff suddenly</p>
<p>received a phone call stating that the child Sun Shancheng was in Room 32 of the China Hotel on Jiujiang Road in the Public Concession, requesting that he be taken back immediately. The plaintiff immediately reported the information to the French Concession police, who dispatched detectives along with the Chinese and Western detectives from the Old Gate police station to assist in rushing to Room 32 of the China Hotel at No. 456 Jiujiang Road. They found the hostage, the child Sun Shancheng, alone in the room, with no one else inside. They inquired with the hotel's accountant and staff, who stated that a person claiming to be Chen Bin had checked into Room 32 on the night of the 23rd,</p>
<p>stayed overnight, and then extended the room for another night, taking the child away at night. However, Sun Shancheng, who had been held in the kidnappers' lair for over eighty days, was still lively and showed no signs of abnormality. He was immediately taken back to the French Concession police station for questioning and then handed over to his family to take back. Yesterday at noon, Judge Zhang of the Second Special Court visited the First Criminal Court to interrogate the defendants who had been arrested earlier. The lawyer representing the police department, Gu Shouxi, stated to the court that the hostage in the case had been found yesterday in the China Hotel and was now</p>
<p>safe and sound. The investigating detective then reported the circumstances of the rescue of the hostage. The plaintiff, Sun Cailing, also brought his son Shancheng to court, stating that the child disappeared between 2:00 and 3:00 PM on August 5th. Later, he found a letter left behind by the kidnappers in his home and received three more letters. When the court questioned the kidnapped child Sun Shancheng, he testified, "That day, the nanny with a scar on her neck took me out to a Chinese-style house. There was a girl named Lin Zhen who played with me. When I made noise, I was beaten." When asked if he recognized any of the defendants in court, Shancheng</p>
<p>looked around at the faces of the defendants and shook his head, indicating that he did not recognize them. According to the detective's report, the hostage was taken to the police station and questioned. He stated that the nanny took him out of the lane to a crossroads and handed him over to a man who took him away in a rickshaw. He was transferred to three different locations, but never left Shanghai. When the court questioned the defendant Chen Tang, she stated, "Yu Tang is my younger sister, and the girl Lin Zhen is my niece. I raised her. I really don't know anything about the kidnapping." The other defendants also denied any involvement in the kidnapping. At this point, the court considered the facts of the case to be clear and ordered the commencement of arguments. After the police department's lawyer presented his arguments, the appointed lawyers Jin Xinmin, Gao Danhua, and others defended the defendants. The court then declared the arguments closed and scheduled sentencing for the morning of the 31st. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>

The chairman then presented the settlement plan for discussion. Subsequently, Xu Zuyan, a lawyer representing the money industry creditors, and Zhu Fuju, a lawyer representing the depositor creditors (representing more than 300,000 in debt), jointly proposed revising the original settlement plan. After the chairman put it to a vote, 194 votes were in favor and one vote was against, passing the revised plan. According to the total debt of 567,000, with 427,077.33 yuan of debt in favor and 190 yuan against, the standard for adjudication is that the debt must exceed 425,441.43 yuan.

The money industry representatives were Xu Zuyan and Sun Hou, the depositor representatives were Zhu Fuju and Fei Wenbao, and the goods creditor representative was Xiang Kangyuan.

(2) For the remaining 90% of Taifeng Company's external debts, half of the amount will be paid by the board of directors at a rate of 20% per year after the company resumes business, to be paid off in five years. Before the debt is paid off, creditors will send representatives to supervise the finances. (3) For the remaining half of the 90% of Taifeng Company's external debts in addition to the first and second items, the company bonds will bear an annual interest of 6%, starting from the sixth year, and one-fifth of the principal will be repaid each year.

When this claim is recovered, or the movable and immovable property is converted into cash, regardless of the amount, it should be used to repay the debt mentioned in the second item as soon as possible. If the Huaming claim is fully recovered, and the debt in the second item has been paid off, and there is still a surplus, it will be used to repay part of the company bonds in advance. (5) All matters related to the collection, conversion, and distribution of Taifeng Company's external claims, and the claims against the Huaming Factory, as well as the movable and immovable property of the Huaming Factory, will still be handled jointly by the original liquidator, Li Ding, an accountant, Qiu Fenling, a lawyer, and the lawyer representatives appointed by the creditors.

<h3>Feili Automobile Company Discovers Suspicious Accounts, Several Dubious Gift Accounts, Shareholder Chen Ronghai Files Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Liu Guojin, a native of Yangzhou, raised funds to establish the Feili Automobile Company on Xiaoshadu Road in western Shanghai in the 20th year of the Republic of China. He served as the general manager himself, and his clansmen Liu Defa and Liu Guojing served as manager and accountant, respectively. Since the company began operations, it has been almost five years, and it has never prepared financial statements for distribution to shareholders. As a result, some shareholders have been quite dissatisfied. Chen Ronghai, also a shareholder, recently negotiated with Liu et al. through his grandfather, requesting an investigation of the company's accounts over the years, but Liu refused. Chen then filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court. When Liu appeared in court, he expressed his willingness to submit the accounts for review. Once he left the court, however, he refused to comply. The court then ordered Liu to be detained, and sent bailiffs along with the plaintiff to the company to briefly examine the account books. They discovered several accounts under the name of gifts, (1) 100 yuan to the Yao family between those who processed license renewals. (2) 50 yuan to the Wu family during the license renewals. (3) 50 yuan for sampling. (4) 108 yuan for the police station's winter solstice gifts. (5) 50 yuan to Cokes. (6) 100 yuan for telephone installation. Chen and his grandson believed that the above accounts were suspicious and were fabricated by Liu et al. to embezzle the funds. They hired lawyer Huang Xiubo to file a criminal private prosecution against Liu Guojin for embezzlement and breach of trust. A hearing has already been held once, and the case has been adjourned to the afternoon of yesterday to continue the hearing, as it is necessary to summon more witnesses. The plaintiff also filed lawsuits against Liu Defa and Liu Guojing for embezzlement and breach of trust. The defendants denied any</p>
<p>collusion or fraud and filed a counterclaim against Chen, accusing him of fabricating facts and requesting that he be punished for false accusation. The presiding judge Liu Yugui first questioned the witnesses Shi Guilan and Gao about whether the gift amounts in the accounts were real. The witnesses stated that Liu Guojin had reported to the shareholders afterwards. The court then questioned Liu about the names of the Yao and Wu families and who received the telephone installation fee, but he claimed that he did not know their names. After the lawyers for both parties argued, Judge Liu</p>
<p>scheduled the sentencing for the morning of October 29.</p>
<h3>Argument Over Three Yuan in Rent Leads to Incident, Woman Dies from Injuries, Forensic Doctor Believes Cause of Death Cannot Be Ascertained Without Autopsy</h3>
<p>Zhu Xu, a 58-year-old local woman, lived at No. 4, Lane 357, Tianjin Road. She had rented a spare room to Shi Chen, a woman from Huzhou. Shi owed three yuan in rent, and Zhu went to collect it the afternoon before last at 5:00 PM, leading to an argument. Shi Chen pushed Zhu Xu violently, and Zhu fell to the ground, immediately losing consciousness. She was sent to the hospital for treatment, but the treatment was ineffective, and she died at 11:15 PM. The Old Gate police station was notified and ordered Chinese detective Feng Xiushan to arrest Shi Chen. She was sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang charged her under Article 278, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code. Since an examination was still needed, he requested that the case be adjourned. Judge Qian Hongye approved the request. Subsequently, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court visited the body to examine it. According to the forensic doctor's report, the cause of Zhu Xu's death could not be ascertained without an autopsy. Therefore, he instructed that the case be heard again after the autopsy.</p>
<h3>Yuan Dagui Goes Insane, Cuts Daughter-in-Law with Knife</h3>
<p>Yuan Dagui, a 57-year-old native of Ningbo, lives at No. 7, Lane 144, Tangen Road. His son works on a ship and is often away from home. His daughter-in-law, Wang, lives alone downstairs, while Yuan sleeps in a loft. He has recently suffered from insanity, which comes and goes. He often speaks inappropriately to Wang. At 7:40 AM the day before yesterday, Wang was still asleep, and Yuan suddenly climbed in through the window with a firewood knife, cutting Wang on the head without asking why. She bled profusely and cried out for help. Yuan abandoned the knife and fled. Chinese detectives Zhang Degong and Qi Fanglian from the Jiaxing Road police station arrived after hearing the alarm and arrested him, bringing him and the firewood knife back to the police station. The injured party was taken to the nursing home for treatment. Yuan Dagui was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday. Public Works Bureau lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated the previous situation, and said that the defendant had been entering his daughter-in-law's bedroom to harass her in the mornings. It is not known whether he is insane. The victim is in the hospital and cannot testify in court, so he requests a postponement. The detectives then reported the arrest, presenting the firewood knife for inspection. When questioned, Yuan Dagui stated that the firewood knife belonged to him. When asked why he cut his daughter-in-law, he remained silent. A young woman named Li Wang stated that the injured party was her younger sister and Yuan Dagui's daughter-in-law. When he has an episode, he is abusive or violent. Judge Xiao Fen instructed that the case must be adjourned, the defendant returned to custody, and a doctor should examine him.</p>

<h3>Empty Sampan Full of Bloodstains: Chen Jichang's Whereabouts Unknown, Likely Murdered; Parents Weep and Report to Police After Hearing of Impending Marriage and Death</h3>
<p>Chen Lansheng, a native of Ningbo, residing at No. 45 Renji Lane, Renji Road, Pudong, used to row a sampan. Now, due to his advanced age, hearing loss, and failing eyesight, he handed over his own sampan, No. 50, to his son, Jichang, to operate. Jichang, currently 21 years old, continues his father's profession, ferrying passengers at the Chunjiang Wharf in Pudong. Around 8 PM the night before last, during a heavy downpour, three men dressed in short attire hailed Jichang's sampan, stating they wanted to cross to the Mitsubishi Company Wharf in Hongkou. Jichang quoted a fare of four dimes. One of them, speaking with a Ningbo accent, haggled down to three dimes, claiming they were also people from the boats and should give them a break. This was known by all the sampans in the area. After Jichang rowed the sampan away, his whereabouts became unknown. He did not return until daybreak. Yesterday morning at 10:05 AM, Chinese Constable No. 24 of the Customs Water Police Station, while patrolling by boat to the Mitsubishi Company Wharf, received a report from the head of the mooring lines at the wharf stating that an empty sampan was drifting in the water near the southernmost mooring post of the wharf at the mouth of the Suzhou Creek, unclaimed. The constable went to investigate and found the sampan number to be 59. Upon inspecting the cabin, he discovered fresh bloodstains and a newly sharpened fruit knife, exceptionally shiny, with obvious traces of blood. However, the person was nowhere to be found. He immediately took the sampan to the police station to report. After investigation by detectives dispatched by the chief, it was discovered that the sampan belonged to Chen Jichang, who had disappeared the night before during the heavy rain. It was speculated that Jichang must have been murdered and his body dumped into the river. The parents, Chen Lansheng and his wife, were summoned to the police station. The two elderly individuals wept and reported the case, stating that their son had chosen an auspicious date, the eleventh day of the eleventh month of the lunar calendar this year, to get married. He was honest and did not have any romantic entanglements, but he enjoyed gambling, often losing all his earnings from a day and night of ferrying. The sampans had a rotation system for taking breaks. When Jichang was off duty, he would always go home to sleep. However, since the Mid-Autumn Festival this year, he had not been frequently at home. He left home on the twenty-third day of this lunar month and had not returned. Judging from his behavior, he certainly did not have any enemies. The cause of his murder was extremely difficult to determine. The police station took statements from the sampan operators at Chunjiang Wharf and decided to investigate the body and arrest the perpetrators.</p>

<h3>Night Soil Contractor Lawsuit: Huang Yue'e Sues Zhang Ridong and Others for Encroachment; Hearing Postponed Pending Transfer of Case Files</h3>
<p>The affairs of the Yangshupu Lan Road Sanitation Bureau under the Bureau of Public Works are currently managed by the Zhang Rixin, Dingxin, and Hengxin brothers from Qingpu. In Shanghai vernacular, those who engage in this trade are called "night soil contractors." Now, the Zhang brothers and their mother, Zhang Gui, have been sued by Huang Yue'e, a young woman residing on Binlang Road, and her younger brother, Huang Chengzhe, who have hired a lawyer to file a criminal self-accusation in the First Special District Court, alleging encroachment on the assets of the sanitation bureau. This case is related to an incident several months ago involving a Ma surname night soil contractor in the French Concession, who was involved in litigation in the Second Special District Court. Therefore, after receiving the Huang siblings' lawsuit, the First Special District Court requested the case files from the Second Special District Court for verification. Yesterday afternoon, Magistrate Liu Yugui opened the court. Except for Zhang Dingxin, all defendants, along with their defense lawyers, reported to the court. However, the Second Special District Court had not yet sent the case files. Magistrate Liu questioned Huang Yue'e about her age, origin, and address. He then commented, "Your brother, Chengzhe, is only eighteen years old and has not reached the age of majority. According to the law, he cannot engage in legal actions. Since his accusations are the same as yours, it would be more convenient for you to sue alone without including your brother's name." Huang Yue'e agreed. The court then inquired about the alleged facts. She stated that all the assets of the sanitation bureau that were encroached upon were located on Lan Road. She had previously sued Zhang's father. Now, part of the assets had been mortgaged by the defendants to the Fuchang Company. The amount encroached upon was no less than several hundred thousand. At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer intended to present a systematic account of the lawsuit for clarity. However, because the Second Special District Court had not yet sent the requested case files and the defendants were not all present, Magistrate Liu adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>

<h3>Over 300 Anhui Disaster Victims Beg for Food in Shanghai, Requesting Relief; Authorities Order Charity to Distribute Rations and Send Them Out of the City; Anhui Province Has Been Affected by Floods and Droughts in Recent Years, Causing Disaster Victims to Beg for Food Everywhere; Over 300 Disaster Victims From Places Like Mengcheng and</h3>
<p>Suzhou Have Begged for Food in Shanghai in Recent Days, Lodging in Temples in the Jiangwan District.

<h3>Pudong Citizens Request Establishment of a Land Bureau Certificate Exchange Office in Yangjing</h3>
<p>Citizens of Pudong, Jia Jinfang, Huang Jiefu, Gao Gengsheng, and others, stated that the Land Bureau's certificate exchange office was moved to Kuangqiao, making it very inconvenient for the people in the Yangjing and Gaohang areas to exchange their certificates. Yesterday, they specially jointly submitted a request to the Pudong Fellow-Villagers Association to ask the bureau to establish a branch office in Yangjing Town to benefit the citizens. The original request is as follows: "The Land Bureau's certificate issuing office is located in Tangqiao Town, Pudong, which is remote. However, it is ordered that residents in the Yangjing and Gaohang areas exchange their certificates simultaneously, making it very difficult for the citizens of Yangjing and Gaohang areas. Yangjing Town is more than ten *li* away from Tangqiao Town, and Gaohang is even more than ten *li* east of Yangjing Town. Therefore, Gaohang is about twenty to thirty *li* from Tangqiao. Yangjing to Tangqiao is already far, and Gaohang to Tangqiao is even more inconvenient. It takes a whole day for a round trip. If it happens to arrive at the office when it is already full, it may take three trips to complete the process. Residents near Tangqiao arrive early because it is close by, and before the office hours begin, the workload for the whole day is already full. Those who arrive from far away have to come again tomorrow, wasting time and money. This is extremely harmful to the people and wastes their money. At this time when commerce is declining and villages are bankrupt, how can the citizens bear this loss? We have seen and heard clearly and cannot sit idly by. Therefore, we earnestly request that a certificate exchange office be established in the Yangjing Town Office (Bairen Hall), which is located in the center between the Tangqiao and Gaohang areas. The location is convenient, and Bairen Hall is also public property, so rent can be saved. Both the citizens and the finances will benefit." (The rest is omitted.)</p>
<h3>Guo Quanying Sentenced for Fornication with Minor: Four Years Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Guo Quanying, from Sanlintang, Shanghai, was a matchmaker for Lu Xiquan, a cloth merchant whose eighteen-year-old daughter, in 1931, was promised to a Zhu family as a daughter-in-law, as arranged by the girl's godfather, Guo Quanying. After the betrothal gifts were exchanged, Guo Quanying brought the girl to Shanghai in the summer of the same year, residing at No. 7 Renmei Lane, West Bailai Road, French Concession, and took her as a concubine. The girl became pregnant and committed suicide by taking poison on June 1st of that year. Guo fled without a trace. The body was reported to the French Police Station by the hospital and taken to the mortuary for examination. The court confirmed the cause of death. Since there were no relatives, the body was buried by a charity. It was not until August 15th of this year that the girl's father, Lu Xiquan, found Guo in the Yizhichun Teahouse in Dongjiadu, Nanshi, and the police arrested him and handed him over to the Public Security Bureau. The French Police Station then</p>
<p>handed Guo over to the Second Special District Court, where the police department filed a public prosecution against him for abduction, fornication, and disturbing public morals. The details of the investigation have been reported previously. The case has been repeatedly investigated by Judge Zhang Chaozuo of the Second Special District Court. According to Guo's statement, he married the plaintiff's daughter as a concubine through a matchmaker named Xi Xigen. The trial has been declared over. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang opened the court and sentenced Guo Quanying to four years of imprisonment and a fine of 600 yuan for abducting and having sexual relations with a girl under the age of twenty. He was found not guilty on the other charges.</p>

<h3>Suzhou Boy Scouts Grand Review and Camp Opening Ceremony Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Zhenjiang Correspondent) The sixth Jiangsu Provincial Elementary and Middle School Boy Scout Grand Review and Camp officially began yesterday. The opening ceremony was held at the Provincial Public Stadium at 9 AM. A total of 159 Boy Scout troops, totaling 5,080 people, attended, along with more than a hundred guests and journalists. The opening ceremony began with an opening speech by Zhou Shaocheng, member and director of the organizing committee, followed by a speech by Zhao Fansheng, representative of the national headquarters. The ceremony concluded in less than an hour, followed by review preparations and curriculum competitions. At 7 PM, the elementary school group held a speech contest, and the middle school group held a bonfire party. Details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Attendees</p>
<p>Attendees included Ling Shaozu, member of the Provincial Executive Committee, Ke Boxun, representative of the Provincial Government, Zhao Fansheng, representative of the national headquarters, Zhang Qingyuan, magistrate of Zhenjiang County, Zhou Shaocheng, member and director, Shi Shunyuan and Wu Jianzhen, deputy directors, and members and judges Yuan Zongze, Zhou Qizhi, Xiang Hongjun, Yuan Ying, Yang Zeqing, Guo Jitong, Li Qifan, Chen Bangcai, Chen Kanghe, Leng Xueqiao, Jiang Zhen, Gai Qixin, Yu Bingjun, and journalists, totaling more than a hundred people.</p>
<p>Boy Scout Attendance</p>
<p>The total number of Boy Scouts from various regions included 61 middle school Boy Scout troops, totaling 2,579 people, 4 independent middle school Girl Scout troops, totaling 158 people, 12 affiliated middle school Girl Scout troops, totaling 365 people, 65 elementary school Boy Scout troops, totaling 1,556 people, 5 independent elementary school Girl Scout troops, totaling 96 people, and 12 affiliated elementary school Girl Scout troops, totaling 299 people, for a total of 5,053 Boy Scouts in attendance.</p>
<p>Opening Speech</p>
<p>At around 9 AM, the Boy Scout troops arrived at the Provincial Stadium from the campsite and the opening ceremony and 20th anniversary celebration began. Director Zhou Shaocheng gave an opening speech, with the following key points: 1. The significance of the review lies in looking at the present and preparing for the future. The review can provide the following assessments and hopes: (1) Whether the Boy Scout training is rigorous, (2) Whether the organization is sound, (3) How well prepared they are, (4) It can provide a comparison of the achievements of each troop and the opportunity for each troop to learn from each other. 2. After the review, I hope everyone will pay attention to two points: (1) Each Boy Scout should be prepared to increase their responsibility as a Boy Scout, (2) Be loyal to the party and the country and work hard for the nation.</p>
<p>Speech from the National Headquarters</p>
<p>Zhao Fansheng, representative of the national headquarters, gave a speech, stating in brief: The Boy Scouts of our country share the same fate as the nation. Only when the status of the nation increases can the youth cause progress. Our country is economically and militarily backward and cannot compete with the great powers, but we have a strength, which is the unity of our 400 million compatriots, which can save us from extinction. I hope the Jiangsu Boy Scouts will maintain the glorious history of the past 20 years, integrate the history of the Boy Scouts and the history of the nation, so that the Chinese nation can achieve the path of rejuvenation. After the speech, the Boy Scout song was sung and the ceremony was declared complete.</p>
<p>Competition Details</p>
<p>There were a total of 13 competitions today, including elementary and middle school climbing, elementary and middle school men's and women's drills, elementary school men's and women's observation, middle school army commander, middle school men's and women's first aid, and middle school women's shooting. Although the weather was clear today, there was a strong sense of rain. The review was completed at 4 PM, and then it drizzled again, and the weather turned cold. There was a hope for sunny weather. The organizing committee held a judge's meeting at 9 PM on the 24th, and everyone thought that because of the bad weather, it was unpredictable whether all the competitions could be completed. The competition results must be announced after all the competitions have been completed. If all the competitions cannot be completed due to rain, then all the results of the completed competitions will be canceled. It is deeply feared that after the partial results are announced, each troop will consider its partial results as its total score, which will inevitably lead to disputes. Therefore, the results of today's competitions cannot be announced and all the judges have kept their mouths shut.</p>

Standing on Mount Beigu or the Meteorological Observatory and looking down, the tents are neatly arranged and look very beautiful. It is a pity that the weather is not good, and the campsite is muddy.</p>

<h3>Three Meetings of the Ministry of Education Medical Education Committee</h3>

Many motions were discussed and decided at the Nursing Education Committee and the Midwifery Education Committee. Among them, there are common points, and the more important matters are summarized below: (1) Because the nursing and midwifery schools in various provinces and cities used to be managed by the civil affairs departments or health bureaus and the health sections of the public security bureaus according to the old administrative system, it was difficult for the education departments to directly handle school administrative matters. In the future, it is planned that the education departments of various provinces and cities will be the administrative organs directly managing nursing and midwifery schools, and the health bureaus and the health sections of the public security bureaus will assist and supervise. (2) Resolved the flexible implementation methods of the standards for the establishment of nursing and midwifery schools in various provinces and cities. (3) Resolved the communication methods between nursing and midwifery schools. (4) Formulated the salary training methods for nurses and midwives. (5) Resolved (5) Resolved the passport methods. (6) Formulated bonus methods for nurses and midwifery students to encourage further studies. (7) Resolved how to change the standards for running nursing and midwifery schools in remote provinces due to economic and talent backwardness.

Each semester, they should inspect at least 30 educational institutions or more, so as to fully understand the actual situation of education in the county. This has already been notified in the past. Recently, it has been found that a small number of heads of the Education Bureaus or the heads of the Third Section of the county governments have not been able to comply with this requirement. In order to urge them to proceed, six key points for the heads of the Education Bureaus or the heads of the Education Sections of the county governments of Jiangsu Province to pay attention to when going to the countryside for inspection are specially formulated and attached with an application form for reference. In addition to issuing separate orders, the notice is hereby issued to the heads of the bureaus to strictly comply with the requirements and not to treat it as a mere formality. Attached are the key points for the heads of the Education Bureaus or the heads of the Education Sections of the county governments of Jiangsu Province to pay attention to when going to the countryside for inspection: (1) The head of the Education Bureau or the head of the Education Section of each county should inspect at least 30 rural educational institutions (primary schools and social educational institutions) each semester, and the inspection should be divided into two times, with at least 10 institutions inspected each time. (2) The head of the Education Bureau or the head of the Education Section should reward or punish or instruct to improve each institution at any time according to the merits of the handling results, and report the reward and punishment or improvement methods to the department for record. (3) The reward and punishment or improvement solutions for the head of the Education Bureau or the head of the Education Section to inspect each institution should be submitted to the department for record four times a year before the end of October, January, April, and other months. (4) When the provincial supervisor comes to the county for inspection, if the head of the Education Bureau or the head of the Education Section cannot go to the countryside for inspection in accordance with the regulations each semester, and the rewards and punishments and improvements are mostly inconsistent, and they cannot be submitted to the department on schedule, the Education Department will give them a reprimand, demerit, or salary reduction respectively. (6) The reporting form used by the head of the Education Bureau or the head of the Education Section to inspect the rewards and punishments or improvement methods in the countryside is prescribed and issued by the department for filling in. (In order to understand the head of the bureau or the head of the section's busy affairs, the text can be omitted. The name of the institution, the name of the director, the general overview of the inspection items, the reward and punishment or improvement methods, the inspection date, and the handling date are filled in on the application form used by the heads of the Education Bureaus or the heads of the Education Sections of the county governments to inspect each educational institution in the countryside. The general overview of the inspection items in the right table is specifically for the items that need attention during the inspection at that time and need to be rewarded or punished or improved. Those that are ordinary and do not need to be dealt with can be exempted from filling in the handling date, which refers to the date of implementation of the punishment and improvement methods.</p>
<h3>The City Library and Museum Will Open Next Spring: Rumors That the Municipal Government Received It Yesterday Are Incorrect</h3>
<p>The two major buildings of the City Center Library and Museum held a completion ceremony on the 10th of this month. The internal decoration still requires time. It is rumored that the municipal government sent personnel to receive them from the construction factory yesterday, which is not true. The reporter learned from relevant parties yesterday that the two buildings were originally scheduled to be received on October 25th, but the project has not yet been completed, such as the installation of electrical wires, which will take a month to complete. Therefore, the exact date of receipt is still difficult to determine, but it will take at least a month. In addition, what has been completed now is only an empty house, and all the internal decoration will take a lot of time. The current chairman of the library is Cai Yuanpei, the director of preparation is Hong Kui, the chairman of the museum is Ye Gongchuo, and the secretary is Li Dachao. All matters during the preparation period are handled by Hong Kui and Li Dachao of the municipal government. The opening date will be next spring.</p>

<h3>Little Men (Seven) (Five)</h3>
<p>—Original by Ms. Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>Little Plum, pleased with this polite enthusiasm, treated her kindly and invited her to sit in the nursery. But Nan En insisted, "No, I want to see the boys and that warehouse!" She ran off, waving her hat with the hatband. Later, the hatband broke, and the hat flew onto the grass, carried away by the wind. She still moved forward towards her destination, without looking back.</p>
<p>The boys saw her coming and shouted, "Hello, Nan En!" She jumped into their ranks and proudly declared:</p>
<p>"I want to live here!"</p>
<p>"Hooray! Unbelievable!" A shout came from the wall. Looking up, it was not Tian Tian but Tao Mo. He had been perched high on the wall. He and Nan En were alike, so hearing that she would be staying for a long time, he anticipated many future "games."</p>
<p>"I can be a batter: let me try," Nan En said. She was good at everything and unafraid of hardship and blows.</p>
<p>"We've already finished playing ball, but even without your help, we beat them."</p>
<p>"Wait a minute, I'll beat you in a race," Nan En replied, feeling that she could boast about this.</p>
<p>"Can she really?" Nai De asked, puzzled.</p>
<p>"A girl is pretty good at running," Jie Ke replied, looking down at Nan En, expressing his approval pompously.</p>

<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Gan Yu)</p>
<p>Past sins can be repented of today; future greatness can only be created today. – On life’s journey, only “today” is the most precious and most important!</p>
<p>Even though “the world's customs are declining,” it’s not that “people's hearts are no longer what they used to be.” If you say the ancients were all improvements, then in the times of Yao and Shun, where did the Four Evils come from?</p>
<p>Someone who is reserved and speaks little is not necessarily “foolish”; someone who is eloquent and speaks quickly is not necessarily “wise.”</p>
<p>It’s better to have no one who slanders me behind my back than to have someone who praises me to my face.</p>
<p>If you take things in the world seriously, then everything is hard to be satisfactory; if you can be optimistic, then everywhere is a happy place.</p>
<p>You must move forward with “hope,” not wait with “hope.”</p>
<p>Those who labor with their minds govern others does not mean that you oppress them; those who labor with their bodies are governed by others does not mean that you are their slaves.</p>
<p>Heaven is you, hell is also you, it just depends on what you do yourself.</p>
<h3>Don't Forget Your Roots</h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>I heard that Feng Yuxiang would call his son to him every day and ask him, "What does your old man do?" His son would always answer, "My old man is a soldier." This is because Feng himself came from the military, endured all kinds of hardships, and achieved his current position. He tells his son not to only know him today but to forget him yesterday, giving him a good lesson in not forgetting his roots.</p>
<p>Because Feng taught his son not to forget his roots, I was reminded of the stories of three wealthy Shanghai families who took not forgetting their roots as a family motto. One family is named Li. Their late Mr. ××, who died not long ago, served as an official in the late Qing dynasty and also did a lot of beneficial public works in the locality during the Republic of China, earning everyone's love. However, he had a very difficult childhood and worked as an apprentice in a blacksmith shop, working the bellows by the furnace every day. Later, he felt that this work was unpromising, so he resolutely sought advancement, studying hard to gain admission to school and passing the imperial examinations, earning an official position. At this point, he, seeing that he was born in hardship, feared that his descendants would die in comfort, so in the family hall where the ancestral tablets were enshrined, he placed a small bellows as an offering, telling his descendants to look at this thing and not forget the origins of their ancestors in hardship, and to always be vigilant. Another family is named Chen. Their ancestors made their fortune by carrying loads on a shoulder pole to buy old goods from street to street. He feared that his descendants would forget their roots and become arrogant and dissolute, so he also placed a pair of old goods shoulder poles in the family hall as an eternal family teaching. There is also a family named Zhang, whose family hall has a pair of water buckets, also to make it known to their descendants that they should not forget that their ancestors started by carrying water while enjoying themselves. These three things in the three family halls were all very effective, because up to this day, the descendants of these three families have been able to not forget their roots and carry on the family business.</p>
<p>In the past, whenever someone rose from humble beginnings to great heights, they would forget the past as quickly as possible, and they would not want to leave any trace of the past in their descendants' minds. Therefore, the wealth or status in the hands of the father was rarely kept in the hands of the son. Today, there is no shortage of people who have risen from poverty, so although it is not necessary to imitate the furnishings in the family halls of the three wealthy families, the three words "don't forget your roots" should be made into a plaque and hung in the central hall to show to the descendants.</p>
<h3>Modern Girls</h3>
<p>— Qiu Zi</p>
<p>A friend came from Jinan and told me that there are modern girls in the streets of Jinan now. They dress fashionably, wearing qipaos and flesh-colored stockings. From a distance, they look like fairies. Upon closer inspection, it turns out to be just flesh color, and there are no stockings at all. It turns out that they have an open mind and hire people to paint flesh-colored stockings on their jade legs. The silk patterns are completely visible, looking like real silk stockings, almost indistinguishable from the real thing, and the luster is even better. The price is eight yuan in national currency for each painting. After the painting is finished, they must avoid washing or scrubbing, otherwise, they will wash away the glamor and return to the original state. The toes are painted with red, which is extremely bright. On top of the two big toenails, there are also painted blue sky and white sun, which is almost unparalleled in its bizarreness.</p>
<p>Originally, it was hot, and it was okay to go barefoot. At most, stocking merchants would complain. Now that they are barefoot, they still need to apply makeup and pretend to wear silk stockings. What is the purpose? Each painting costs eight yuan in national currency. At three times a month, it costs at least twenty-four yuan, which is more expensive or cheaper than buying silk stockings? If you say that there is plenty of money, then you can donate one yuan or half a yuan more to the disaster victims who are waiting to be fed. Saving a life is more than just building a seven-story pagoda. Why not think of this, but instead paint the blue sky and white sun on the big toes, thinking that this is the only way to achieve the ultimate in modernity? Isn’t it a strange thing?</p>

<p>Chapter Twenty: Struggling to Survive, Watching the Beloved Grandson, Embracing and Crying, Remembering the Past in a Famine Year, Sowing Wheat and Inviting Disaster</p>
<p>Because my dad has to fight with others for water during the day, and he can't get much water anyway, my dad changed his method. He let people fetch water during the day, and when everyone was asleep in the middle of the night, he would go to work calmly. From April to June, our wheat grew very well. We estimated that we could harvest five or six hundred catties. Although the wheat planted by other families was watered later than ours, they also had some harvests. Relying on these two wells, the whole fort was always better than other places. Mrs. Zhou said: I don't understand the affairs of your Northwest, but I know about the crops in the South. The most difficult thing about crops is the period when the old grain is gone and the new grain is not yet harvested. Although the wheat you planted is growing very well, it has not yet been harvested. According to what you said, the food you eat has long been mixed with grass roots. It has been a few months now, what have you been eating? Yueying said: You are right, although we planted several hundred catties of wheat, it is only good to look at, but our stomachs are getting more and more uncomfortable every day. As for food, rich families may still have some, but poor families like us can't borrow or buy it, so we can only eat more grass roots. This can also be said to be a strength for wealth, because our wheat fields are constantly watered, and there are many weeds growing, so we brought these weeds back and cooked them with water to eat. The grass grew back on the ground after we pulled it once, so we ate boiled weeds like this for two months. (249)</p>
<h3>Records of the Lingering Fragrance</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Speaking of the word "demon," the gardener's voice was almost inaudible.</p>
<p>Li Lianying immediately felt hesitant after learning the details of the matter. He pondered silently, because he already believed that what the gardener said was true. In the late autumn, a single magnolia flower blooming was indeed an ominous anomaly. However, he also knew that the Empress Dowager was a deeply superstitious person, who usually paid attention to choosing auspicious days and auspicious times, and wished she could see the words "happiness" and "longevity" everywhere, and hear auspicious words or praises all the time. If such an ominous message were conveyed to her, I really don't know how much trouble it would cause her! So it was Li Lianying's turn to play the pipa himself. However, he was, after all, an old, slick fellow with many tricks. After hesitating for a while, he already had a plan in mind.</p>
<p>"Since there is really such a strange thing, I will certainly report it to the Old Buddha!" He said to the gardener, "There is nothing for you to do now. Go back and take care of it carefully! When the Empress Dowager wants to ask you, I will send someone to summon you!"</p>
<p>This was at eight or nine o'clock in the morning! The Empress Dowager was still dressing and preparing to go to court, and I was also serving by her side. Suddenly, Li Lianying hurried in, and all of us turned our heads together, focusing our attention on his face. (445)</p>
<h3>鴟梟</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>In the morning, when I wake up and hear the crow cawing a few times above my head, I must spit at it and curse it a few times. In reality, crows have mouths; how can one prevent them from calling out? However, its call is just a little unpleasant, and it doesn't really cause any harm to people. Why bother cursing at it? This is the crow's misfortune! Among the birds, the owl shares a similar fate with the crow. When it emits a mournful cry in the dark of night, it similarly causes people to feel disgust and aversion.</p>
<p>The appearance of an owl is such that it has wide eyes and a round face, much like a cat's face. Therefore, it is commonly called a "cat-headed eagle." Moreover, it is naturally fierce, hiding during the day and coming out at night, and it enjoys eating its own kind, which adds another layer of disgust for people. When it cries, it first pauses and stutters as if saying "Carry out! Carry out!" Then, it lets out a long, melodious cry, like the sound of a bell. So, villagers also call it "bell-ringing crow." According to old superstitious legends, "Whenever it cries mournfully, there will surely be a death in the neighborhood." Therefore, whenever someone wakes up in the middle of the night during a windy, moonless night and hears its cry, it is bound to make one's hair stand on end, suspecting that some ominous event will occur. Because of this legend, I was once fooled by someone when I was a child. Someone told me, "It's crying 'Carry out! Carry out!' It must be talking about someone's death. As long as you put your ear to the mouth of the jar, you will be able to hear clearly which person has died." Driven by curiosity, I spent a sleepless night, and whenever it cried, I quickly put my ear to the mouth of the jar to explore the secret of what it was crying. The result, of course, was failure.</p>
<p>Its nest also likes to be made on top of tall ginkgo trees. Those tall ginkgo trees are the source of neighborhood myths: what with lightning strikes, snake spirits, and the appearance of tree gods! People will naturally add to the associations. It actually chooses to live here. How can one not regard it as an ominous and mysterious bird!</p>
<p>Travel Notes</p>
<h3>Autumn in Wu Mountain</h3>
<p>— Zhu Xi</p>
<p>Time flies like an arrow, and in the blink of an eye, the autumn scenery is gradually fading. With the art of playing chess, white flowers, yellow chrysanthemums, and plump crabs, the autumn scenery is already a feast for the eyes. In this season, Mandarin Duck Lake in Jiaxing is undoubtedly a famous scenic spot. The misty scenery from the top of the Rain Tower is more than enough to make people linger. Suzhou, in this autumn season, of course, also has many famous scenic spots for sightseeing. They are written below to serve as an experienced guide.</p>
<p>Red Leaves of Tianping: At the foot of Tianping Mountain is the ancestral tomb of Mr. Fan Zhongyan. There, the mountain rocks are arranged side by side, like ten thousand scepters paying homage to the heavens. As a scenic spot for the virtuous, it embellishes the mountain with majestic scenery.</p>
<p>The foot of Tianping Mountain is covered with maple trees. In this time of gradually fading autumn light, the maple leaves gradually turn bright red, a sheet of red light, like clouds rising and mist gathering, as if there were peach and apricot trees everywhere. It truly contains boundless poetic and artistic charm! Tianping Mountain is located on the west side of Suzhou City. It is about five or six miles past Mudu by the Fan Road. Recently, the Suzhou-Mudu Highway has opened for cars, making round trips very convenient.</p>
<p>Osmanthus Flowers of Dengwei: Dengwei Mountain in Guangfu Town is famous for its plum blossoms. When spring arrives in the world, the foot of Guangfu Mountain is covered with plum blossoms, opening like a sea of fragrant snow. However, the prosperity of the osmanthus flowers in autumn is no less than that of the plum blossoms in spring. When the osmanthus flowers are in bloom, the rich fragrance of osmanthus has already wafted into the cabin when the boats dock at the pier. The osmanthus flowers in Guangfu, starting from the top of Tiger Hill, Jianxi Kiln, and villages everywhere, are truly blooming like gold all over the ground, extremely resplendent. The Suzhou candy stores and cake shops send people to purchase these osmanthus flowers, which produce several thousand yuan a year and are a byproduct of local agricultural products. Guangfu is located relatively far away, but the Suzhou-Fu Highway is being built at an accelerated pace. In the near future, after the highway is completed, transportation will be much more convenient for travel.</p>
<p>Water Chestnuts of Nantang: Suzhou is a land of water. The clear waves in Huangtiandang outside Fengmen City, with the fragrance of lotus spreading for ten miles, is not only a scenic spot in summer. Even in autumn, the green water chestnuts have already grown and matured. Eating them raw is tender, fresh, and delicious, and they are very fragrant and glutinous when cooked. The water chestnut leaves float green on the water, like jasper. When the breeze rises, the water chestnut waves sway with the wind, creating ripples. Embellished with the rural children picking water chestnuts, the wonderful scenery is truly like stepping into a painting.</p>
<p>Reed Flowers of Stone Lake: Reed flowers are everywhere in Stone Lake at the foot of Shangfang Mountain. As the autumn light fades, the reed stalks release pure white flowers, a sheet of silver light, embellishing the lush green reeds, majestic and unrestrained, truly a unique scenery. The reeds in the lake are worth about a thousand yuan each year. In addition to being used as firewood, they can also be used as skeletons for funerary items and for making brooms and other various items.</p>
<p>Autumn Scenery of Dongting: In the clear and crisp autumn air, the vast lake waves are as still and blue as a mirror. The vastness and charm of Taihu Lake are truly no less than those of West Lake. The East and West Dongting Mountains stand facing each other in the lake. The East Dongting Mountain has a circumference of more than fifty miles. Climbing to the top of Moli Peak, the entire lake view can be seen, and the seventy-two peaks can be counted one by one, embellished with a few returning sails. This kind of scenery is full of poetic and artistic charm, making people reluctant to leave. The West Dongting Mountain is surrounded by peaks, very majestic. The Piaomiao Peak stands high above the entire mountain. The Biluo Peak, which produces the famous Biluochun tea, is located on the side of the Piaomiao Peak. In addition to the East Mountain producing loquats and the West Mountain producing bayberries, the pomegranates in autumn are as big as bowls, with red seeds like rubies, and the taste is also very sweet. The scenery of Dongting is very beautiful, but unfortunately, transportation is not very convenient, which is a slight drawback.</p>

<h3>Finance: The Majority Still Not Satisfied; Raised Again to 1,120 Yuan After Closing; The Short Side Is Forced to Settle at a Loss; Another Increase of 37 Yuan, Exceeding the Settlement Price by 110 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market initially stabilized due to adjustments by banks and showed signs of weakness after a strong opening. Unexpectedly, the majority still had the strength to push prices up, turning the short sellers into sitting ducks. The upward trend regained momentum, and after closing, a new high of 1,120 yuan was seen. The short side was under economic pressure and unable to sustain. The future of the gold market is bound to have surprises. It was observed that in the morning, overseas silver markets were shrinking in England and flat in the United States. Forward silver prices in Montedelli were suspended, and exchange rates fluctuated. Spot gold in London fell by one penny, but sentiment remained good. Pre-market trading opened, immediately rising to 73-74 yuan. Supply was lacking, and major players like Shen Feng, Fuxing, and Yong immediately entered the market, rising to over 90 yuan. Dachenghua, Dingkang, Wanxing, Fuxing, Yongyifeng, Yongyuan, and Mao Yong supplied shares at high prices, retreating to 81 yuan. Shen Feng and Yongli again entered the market at 87 yuan, with Yifeng and Yongheng selling the remainder at 3-4 yuan. Dachenghua, Shen Feng, Fuxing, Yong Yingxiang came in, pushing prices up to 90 yuan again. The Central Bank's exchange rate announcements revealed declines in both British and American currencies, and the customs gold unit rose by 0.75%, with the standard gold price rising to 987.3 yuan. However, Fuxing and Dachenghua sold shares at high prices, retreating to 87 yuan. After opening, due to continued buying by major players, many short sellers were forced to cover, pushing prices to a new high of 1,096 yuan. Banks' appetites were satiated, triggering selling pressure and causing a decline. However, there was still much struggle along the way, as buying interest had not died. Unfortunately, the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) announced flat rates for both British and American currencies, and banks sold aggressively, rushing to unload. It was rumored that this position was being used by the Central Bank to regulate the market, calming sentiment. In addition, the Hong Kong market also eased, causing a sharp decline to 1,050 yuan. Buyers then became active, gradually improving the situation. Predictions for Indian silver were strong, and although there was consolidation after the rise, sentiment gradually stabilized, and the midday close still rose to above 70 yuan. After closing, the market initially weakened but then became strong again. In the afternoon, the market immediately broke through 80 yuan. After opening, the competition between buyers and sellers was fierce, and market prices fluctuated around 80 yuan. Although banks had selling interest, their positions were limited. With tight exchange rates, the gold market followed the rise led by major players like Shen Feng. Indian silver initially rose by 4 annas, but there was consolidation along the way. However, as short sellers like Hengyu covered their positions, the market rose to 90 yuan. Banks took advantage of the high prices to unload, and Indian silver was reported flat for the second time. After the high, prices fell back, briefly breaking the 80 yuan level. However, with bullish sentiment, demand exceeded supply, and prices easily rebounded. Finally, due to panicked sentiment, prices rose to a new high of 1,100 yuan. After closing, the majority took the opportunity to buy, and short sellers were forced to cover their positions. Sellers were intimidated by the power of the major players and stood by, lacking supply. The weaker short sellers became sitting ducks, and economic pressures made it difficult to pay the margin, forcing them to settle at a loss, creating the unprecedented high price of 1,120 yuan. Regarding swaps, the majority posted 12 yuan.</p>
<p>The morning opened at 1,087 yuan, up 25 yuan from the previous close. Yingxiang, Hengyu, Fuxing, Yong Shenfeng came in, rising to 96 yuan. Dachenghua and Richang sold at high prices at 90 yuan.

Mitsui and McCalley had blocked US dollars for December at 3.75, Chunyuan Yong Fuxing Yong Hengyu Yuanmaoyong Wanxing sold off, falling to 60 yuan. Although Dada Dachenghua entered at 2 yuan, Fuxing, Yongheng, Dachenghua Yuanmaoyong Zhengchang again sold to 57.5 yuan. Fuxing and Yong Shenfeng continued to enter, rebounding to 62 yuan. Datong released US dollars for December, easing further to 7.5. Fuxing Yong Dachenghua Huixiang Wanxing Shenfeng Hengyu sold, falling to 50 yuan.

Lichang Fuxing Yong Yuanmaoyong sold shares, but because Dachenghua Dingkang still accepted, although it fell, it consolidated. Predicting that Indian silver would rise by 3 annas, Hengyu Jiatai Wuchangxiang Chunyuanyong Wanxing sold to 63.5 yuan. Futai Yong Yuqing Yong Xiangfeng Deli still accepted, gradually rising to 76 yuan. Shenfeng Fuxing Yong Hengchang Yong Hengyu took advantage of the high prices to sell, falling to 0.5 yuan. Huixiang Dachenghua Fuxing Yong Fuyu came in, and the majority took the opportunity to raise prices, and the midday close rose to 1,076 yuan again. After closing, Fuxing Yong Hengyu and others came to sell and weakened, but finally, it was raised from 70 yuan to 80 yuan.</p>

Fuyu Hengyu Fuxing Yong Qingfa Yong Dachenghua Dada bought shares one after another, rising to 88.8 yuan. HSBC blocked Sterling for December at 5.625, and Yongli Dachenghua Hengyu sold off, falling to 5.5 yuan. Dafa Yong Dada Yumao Yong Fuyu still entered, rising to over 90 yuan, rising to 92 yuan.

Dada Fuyu Fuxing Yong Yuqing Yong took advantage of the high prices to supply shares, retreating to 96 yuan. Dachenghua entered again, and the closing price rose to 1,099 yuan. After closing, Dachenghua Shenfeng Yongli Wushengyong Yifeng Yong Dachangxiang Wu Yi Hengyu and others bought shares one after another. The market was panicked, lacking sellers, and prices rose to a new high of 1,118 yuan. With a slight supply, prices retreated to around 10 yuan, but Yongli and others still accepted, and finally it was 14-15 yuan. This was due to a part of the weak short sellers being forced to settle at a loss, and there were no other special circumstances.</p>
<p>The settlement price was based on the Central Bank's standard gold price, which rose to 987.3 yuan. However, the gold market jumped even higher, and according to the closing price, it rose by 112 yuan, which was 16 yuan more than the previous close. The November accounting price was 1,070 yuan, and the December price was 1,076 yuan. The morning make-up water was 1,070 yuan, and the afternoon accounting price was 1,093 yuan for November and 1,099 yuan for December. The afternoon make-up water was 1,093 yuan, and the red gold price was reduced by 4 yuan to 1,083 yuan. The spot market was flat, and Tianjin goods were at par with the futures price. 350 taels were sold by the Tianjin gang to Yingfenghua, and cooked red gold was priced at 2 yuan, but there were no transactions. For swaps, Yingfenghua posted to Hengxing 28 shares at 10 yuan and 0.05 yuan, and Yuanmaoyong posted to Shengyi 42 shares, rising further to 12 yuan. The majority's situation was even more panicked.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was extremely chaotic. In summary, Shenfeng Yongli Zhaofengchang Yuqingyong Qianchangxiang Dingkang Yongfeng Dafa Yong Fuxingyong Shunmao Wanfeng Liyu and others were on the buying side, while Wanxing Huixiang Yuanshengyong Hengxing Yifengyong Chunyuanyong Fuyu Lifeng Ruixing Tianfeng Dacheng Yiyu Yicheng and others were on the selling side. The Dalian gang, Wanxing, did a total of more than 1,300 shares, covering about 700. Shunli did a total of more than 200 shares, with even coverage. Transactions by the Guangdong gang Shengyi Hengxing were small, but Hengxing slightly covered. Including clearing, about 200 shares were traded.</p>
<p>It was observed that the market was initially flat and then strong throughout the day. The majority, Shenfeng, raised prices from time to time, and the situation in the market became even more tense. The morning opened at 1,087 yuan, and the afternoon closed at 1,099 yuan. The highest price was 1,100 yuan in the afternoon, and the lowest price was 1,050 yuan in the morning, with a fluctuation of 50 yuan. As a result, it rose by 37 yuan compared to the previous close. 2,009 November shares remained, with 17 majority parties and 12 short parties. The December chip count was 18,424 shares, with 50 majority parties and 45 short parties. The total number of transactions was 45,717 shares in the morning and 33,019 shares in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The tactics of the majority were mostly deployed before the market opened and after it closed, leaving no official market to rely on. Short sellers saw no opportunity to extricate themselves, and the payment of margin, in this period of tight financial contraction, was unsustainable. It is rumored that small transactions of 1 yuan, which had not been completely eliminated, are now said to be coming to an end. If the seller's economic agent truly reaches the end of the road, it is not a blessing for the market, and the lack of public confidence is even greater.</p>
<h3>Although There Was Adjustment, Foreign Exchange Remains Extremely Tight; Banks' Selling Interest Eventually Dries Up; Speculators' Buying Interest Becomes Stronger</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign telegrams reported that London was reducing the near term to the far term by 0.0625, the New York silver market was unchanged, forward silver prices in Montedel were suspended, spot gold in London fell by one penny, the pound rose against the dollar by 1.25, the pound was unchanged against the franc, the dollar fell against the pound by 0.375, and the dollar rose against the franc by 1.25. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with recent selling prices, with the pound at 1 shilling and 4 pence and the dollar at 32.8125 yuan, which was 0.1875 tighter for the pound and 0.4375 tighter for the dollar compared to the previous close. After opening, sentiment was still strong and even tighter, and the Central Bank's exchange rate announcements revealed a decline of 0.375 for the pound and 0.8125 for the dollar, with the customs gold unit rising by 0.75%. Banks repeatedly supplied together at high prices, and although Chinese merchants made purchases, it was difficult to stop the selling pressure and the market eased. Anticipating that HSBC's rates for British and American currencies would be flat, sentiment was depressed, and banks' selling interest remained strong, repeatedly unloading. It was rumored that the Central Bank was secretly intervening to maintain the market, and with Hong Kong also hardening, the process gradually hardened, easing step by step. At one point, it was extremely hard, and Chinese merchants took advantage of the cheapness to maintain it. Afterwards, banks' selling wind slightly subsided, and the process gradually tightened. Predicting that Indian silver would rise by 3 annas, the overall trend was uncertain at noon. In the afternoon, the market immediately tightened, and although HSBC made supplies, they were doing business with banks. Although Chinese merchants finalized their purchases, demand exceeded supply, and the market gradually tightened. Indian silver was reported to have risen by 4 annas, and although banks supplied at high prices, there was still a return. However, with Chinese merchants' strong buying interest and the help of the gold market, the market remained tight. Although banks threw out at high prices, their positions were limited. Indian silver was reported flat for the second time, and although there was a slight easing, maintenance was more important. Finally, the market continued to be extremely tight, and the test situation was tense after closing, as the gold market jumped even further. The closing price for recent selling was 1 shilling and 4 pence 0.1875, and the dollar was 33.125 yuan. Compared to the previous close, the pound was flat and the dollar was 0.125 yuan tighter. Swaps were opened, and the forward term was 0.125 tighter for the pound and 0.5 yuan tighter for the dollar. Chinese merchants purchased about 60,000 pounds and 1 million US dollars. It is rumored that the Central Bank secretly entrusted HSBC and others to sell a lot, and the current standard gold is more than 10 yuan higher than the forward US dollar.</p>

<h3>The Third Round of Long-Term Loans Concludes - Most Expired Loans Are Rolled Over -</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the 25th, was the third major period for the conclusion of long-term loans in the financial industry. Due to market conditions, various parties ultimately lacked the ability to repay, so most of the loans were rolled over. However, for the sake of their own interests, the creditors were unable to provide as much as they wanted. It is estimated that no less than one-third of the money shops and even a small number of banks faced tightening, trying to recover their funds but struggling to succeed. Therefore, the result yesterday was that the total amount of loans expiring at banks reached 7.34 million, of which only 600,000-700,000 was in deposits, while more than 6 million was in outstanding loans. Naturally, all the indebted clients rolled over their loans, with only a small amount of tens of thousands being recovered. The total amount of loans expiring at money shops even exceeded 15 million. The Chamber of Commerce had announced a flexible solution, so the results of the negotiations were free of difficulties. The hardship was that the money shops were unable to recover their own receipts and disbursements, which posed a major problem. According to a reporter's investigation yesterday, an important figure said that nine out of ten of the long-term loans expiring this round were rolled over, so there was no problem. However, due to the large gap between receipts and disbursements, there was a disparity between joy and hardship. The previous two periods (the 15th and 20th) were barely survived. Now (the 25th) and the end of the month have more than 30 million expiring, which is likely to cause some movement. It is not expected to have a major impact. Most of the Ningbo banks' long-term loans have been consolidated and settled. Although there are 2-3 million expiring at the end of the month, arrangements have been made to roll them over uniformly. Interest rates were divided into six market prices, ranging from 8.75 yuan to 10.05 yuan. In addition, it is heard that Chinese banks have many bad debts in their long-term loans. Even if the debts are active, it is feared that most of them will only be rolled over in this difficult key.</p>
<h3>Securities: Short Squeeze Sharp, Bond Prices Rise Steadily - Demobilization 96 Shows Strongest Gains</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the last day for this month's futures at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange. The market rose again, with a particularly severe short squeeze, especially in demobilization bonds, where the near-term price was a significant two yuan higher than the far-term price. This was because Number 78's delivery of goods had been substantial, and the shorts were disappointed that they didn't get to cover. They had to cut their losses or roll over their positions, leading to a backwardation market. The overall environment seemed to have improved slightly, and rumors of inflation were rampant. The situation between England and Italy had indeed gradually become more harmonious. Margin calls rose sharply again, and short covering in the market gradually started, causing market prices to gradually turn bullish, with a trend towards rising prices. Today, only the November futures will be traded for one month, and trading is expected to be very active.</p>
<p>Yesterday's performance: At the opening, the current month's demobilization bonds rose by one yuan and two jiao and a half, while the forward month rose by only three jiao. Northern dealers were the most active buyers. Other bonds also rose by three, five jiao or more. In the second round, Northern dealers and Number 78 and others continued to buy, and roll-over trades were extremely active, causing the market to be slightly chaotic, but there were still more advances than declines. When the market opened in the afternoon, roll-over trades were even more chaotic, with inconsistent highs and lows. Afterwards, Numbers 48 and 78 continued to actively bid. After the Consolidated Tax, there was another rise of two or three jiao. Up to this point, 96 bonds remained relatively stable. At the close, Numbers 48, 69 and 78 were even more active buyers, and the far-term demobilization bonds also recovered to eight jiao and a half, and the Regular Six bonds also rose by eight or nine jiao. Suddenly, 96 bonds experienced an extreme surge, with the forward bonds rising wildly by nine jiao, reaching a high of twelve yuan and seven jiao. As a result, the market saw gains ranging from as little as one or two jiao to as much as one yuan and three or four jiao, and the high-low range narrowed. There is still upward momentum today. The total transaction volume was approximately 30 million yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan):</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Turmoil Continues, Marked Yarn Prices Rise Again</h3>
<p>The yarn market rose in the afternoon after falling in the morning, resembling a violent storm. With the surge of capital, people were enthusiastic, speculators were active, the market was unusually flush with chips, and the market was extremely chaotic. There were many rumors. Ultimately, with the margin hovering at a high level, more buyers emerged, and market prices continued to rise. The outlook remains turbulent. It is reported that 1,000 bales of Double Deer 20s yarn and 50 bales of Red Crest Star will be delivered in October.</p>
<p>This Month's Marked Yarn Reaches a High Price Before Departure</p>
<p>In the morning session of the marked yarn market, the near month was still high, and the margin rate also opened high. Sentiment was still good, but a slight softening appeared in the mid-session as the market had risen sharply for several days, and short covering took advantage of the opportunity to exit. However, the marked cotton head opened with the far month suddenly falling by four jiao and a half. In the second round, selling intensified, and the market was slightly flush with chips. All months declined by more than one yuan, but large firms such as Changfeng and Dafeng continued to pull in and add to their positions. At the close, there was a slight rebound. As a result, all months fell by five, six, eight, nine jiao to one yuan and one jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. When the afternoon session opened, this month was the last day of trading, breaking through 80 yuan and reaching a high of 81 yuan. Due to a lack of chips for delivery and news that margin prices were rising again, market sentiment suddenly tightened, and the far month was driven by the market to repeatedly advance. The market was particularly chaotic. The third round of this month reached 182 yuan and five jiao, and then fell back by one yuan and a half at the close to 181 yuan, an increase of six yuan and six jiao compared to the previous month's closing price of 174 yuan and four jiao. As a result, all months rose by one yuan and six jiao to two yuan and one jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was found that 950 bales were sold by Tongshe, 850 bales by Dafu, 3,000 bales by Yuda, 1,250 bales by Daji, 1,700 bales by Hexing, 1,550 bales by Tongfeng, 1,600 bales by Yuan, 2,500 bales by Jiankang, 3,050 bales by Jinchang, 1,150 bales by Ruid, 1,600 bales by Senkang, 1,600 bales by Yichang, and 2,750 bales by Tonghe. 4,000 bales were bought by Dafeng, 1,550 bales by Jinchang, 3,200 bales by Gengfeng, 3,350 bales by Shenji, 1,050 bales by Yichang, 4,050 bales by Changfeng, 1,700 bales by Changyu, 2,950 bales by Dachangcheng, and 3,700 bales by Xincheng. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Marked Yarn	Highest Price	Lowest Price	Closing Price	Change	Inventory</p>
<p>October	182.5	179.1	181.0	Up 1.30	8,700</p>
<p>November	181.9	180.2	181.9	1.00	44,800</p>

<p>Total	160,500</p>
<p>Current Yarn Trading Opens at 800 Bales</p>
<p>Sales of current yarn remained sluggish. A total of 805 bales were purchased by various dealers throughout the day. Prices were firm. The purchase amounts of various dealers are as follows:</p>

<h3>Resales and Short Covering Arrive Together: Cotton Tries to Fall But Rises Instead - This Month, Short Squeeze Causes Another 0.5 Yuan Increase</h3>
<p>The cotton market initially fell due to profit-taking after several days of soaring prices. In the afternoon, it was reported that margin rates remained stable, and there were rumors that the silver dollar would be devalued sooner or later. All sorts of rumors were deeply imprinted in the minds of market participants. Upon encountering good news, buyers bravely advanced, and shorts were like frightened birds, unable to resist. Market prices then surged. It is said that 20,000 dan of Dongmian cotton, 6,000 dan from the Dingxin Factory, and 2,000 dan purchased by speculators were delivered this month, totaling 28,000 dan.</p>
<p>Far-Term Cotton Jumps Out of the 7 Yuan Range</p>
<p>In the morning session of the marked cotton market, prices fell across the board because the previous day's rise had been too drastic, causing a large number of profit-takers to exit, resulting in a loose and flooded market, showing signs of a reaction and pullback. However, major firms continued to purchase, and as a result, all months fell by three to four jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. When the afternoon session opened, this month jumped up by three jiao because it was the last day of trading and it was said that Dongmian, a Japanese firm, intended to take delivery. The far month was stimulated and rose. After the second round, market prices advanced steadily, and the far month showed a surge again. March jumped out of the 7 yuan range because major firms were vigorously purchasing and short covering. As a result, all months rose by an average of five jiao and a half to seven jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was found that 3,200 dan were sold by Ruida, 2,800 dan by Dafeng, 6,500 dan by Dafu, 2,900 dan by Yuda, 2,200 dan by Daji, 2,700 dan by Hengde, 5,100 dan by Shenji, 5,800 dan by Yuan, 3,000 dan by Runkang, 1,500 dan by Yuanxingchang, 4,000 dan by Tongyu, and 2,200 dan by Yichang. 2,100 dan were bought by Tongfu, 3,400 dan by Meiji, 6,300 dan by Tongji, 9,200 dan by Dafeng, 2,700 dan by Yuanda, 3,900 dan by Heyu, 5,200 dan by Yichang, 3,100 dan by Changfeng, 3,800 dan by Xincheng, 11,900 dan by Changhe, and 7,300 dan by Jiankang. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Marked Cotton	Highest Price	Lowest Price	Closing Price	Change	Inventory</p>
<p>October Futures	35.20	34.50	35.20	Up 0.50	43,000</p>
<p>November Futures	35.70	14.85	35.70	0.30	147,100</p>
<p>December Futures	36.30	35.40	36.10	0.25	152,900</p>
<p>January Futures	36.60	35.65	36.50	0.50	144,400</p>
<p>February Futures	36.90	35.95	36.75	0.30	13,00</p>
<p>March Futures	37.15	36.10	36.95	0.25	91,00</p>
<p>Total	701.400</p>
<p>Japanese Firms are Particularly Keen on Current Cotton</p>
<p>Regarding current cotton consumption, Japanese firm Dongmian is buying actively, while Chinese factories are less interested. The sources are estimated to be 1,800 bales of Yao cotton and 1,100 bales of Tong cotton.</p>
<p>Fire Engine Cotton 38.15 Dongmian is actively importing 2,000 bales, delivered to various factories.</p>
<p>Tianjin American Cotton 46.75 Also 200 pieces of spot goods delivered from the warehouse.</p>
<p>Nanyuan 48.00 Also 208 pieces Also Also</p>
<p>Han Fine Russian 40.50 Also 251 pieces Also Also</p>
<p>Xiasha Cotton 41.50 Yufeng Factory imported 200 pieces Also Sent to the factory</p>
<p>Import Statistics for Foreign Cotton</p>
<p>Recently, foreign cotton imports to this port include 788 pieces of American cotton, 1,900 pieces of Indian cotton, and 350 pieces of Egyptian cotton, totaling 3,038 pieces. There were no imports of Burmese cotton, African cotton, or South American cotton.</p>
<h3>Grain: Most Marked Flour Transactions Concluded</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the flour market opened with all months remaining stable as gold prices revisited new records, jumping horizontally to over 90 yuan in the morning session. Market sentiment was quite shaken. All months were about one point higher than the previous day's closing price. However, amidst this chaotic and uncertain situation, the excitement of industry participants was relatively reduced. Because actual transactions were not smooth and the international situation was unpredictable, the number of new buyers was scarce, and most transactions were liquidations of old positions. Although turnover reached over 5,000 bags, the market atmosphere tended to be stable. When the afternoon session opened, there were fewer transactions, and the market turned sideways. Unless there are unexpected disturbances, it may return to a flat level.</p>
<p>This Month's Wheat Sellers Roll Over Positions</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market saw prices for all months relatively stable in the morning session due to a slight improvement in foreign wheat and a continued rise in gold prices. Near-term months were up by one or two points, while far-term months were flat. However, trading was not smooth, and there was no sign of an upsurge. By the time the afternoon session opened, the current month was approaching delivery, and short positions were rolling over, so the market remained stable. In the far-term months, the market was sluggish as industry participants liquidated large quantities. Recently, the asking price for current foreign wheat has reached 6 yuan and 45 jiao, which seems difficult to trade, but exchange rate changes are unpredictable, so people are unwilling to raise prices excessively. There were no transactions in current wheat because inventory was not abundant. Customers wanted to raise prices, but factories thought the price was too high, so it became a stalemate.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous: Galangal Prices Soar</h3>
<p>Galangal is produced in Guangdong Province and is a spice. Recently, there has been a shortage of arrivals, and inventory in Shanghai is also very scarce. Therefore, asking prices have risen repeatedly. It was heard yesterday that a batch was quoted at 20 yuan. It is said that the lowest price was only about 8 yuan, so the difference is as much as one and a half times.</p>

<p>Publishing World</p>
<h3>Which Road Should the Publishing Industry Take?</h3>
<p>— Yu Hui</p>
<p>In Mr. Leng Feng's "The Awareness the Publishing Industry Should Have" in the 27th issue of this magazine, two very obvious trends in the current publishing industry were pointed out: one is that everyone is working hard to reprint ancient books, and the other is that everyone is competing to publish sensual and erotic pictorials. Generally speaking, Mr. Leng Feng is not wrong. Bookstores with slightly more financial resources and slightly larger scale are now mostly working on the reprinting and整理 of ancient books. Smaller bookstores with weak financial resources are competing to publish pictorials and some magazines with empty content and merely beautiful forms to attract customers. This phenomenon makes people with insight feel pessimistic about the future of Chinese culture. However, I don't think this pessimism is necessary, because this is an inevitable trend. Why? From this deformed phenomenon in the current publishing industry, can't we clearly see the weak purchasing power of the general readers? What kind of customers buy series of books or series of publications with thousands of copies, or as few as dozens or even a dozen copies, goes without saying. And what kind of readers buy pictorials and publications with shallow content, I think most readers can imagine. The best customers of the current publishing industry are people like them, and although bookstores say it nicely that they are promoting culture, we can't ask them to do loss-making business, or ask them to publish books that can't find customers, or only suit the interests and needs of people who generally can't afford to buy books and magazines. Therefore, the two paths shown by the publishing industry at present are inevitable. People who care about the future of Chinese culture, I think, should not be pessimistic about this phenomenon. On the contrary, we should think of some more effective ways for the publishing industry so that bookstores do not hinder their business, and readers can get some practical benefits. It is of no benefit to be pessimistic or to curse the mistakes of the publishing authorities.</p>
<p>Now that we have seen the weakness of general purchasing power, we cannot deny the increase in the general readers' desire for knowledge. If they have a little spare money, they will never waste it except for some books that are indeed urgently needed for them, let alone buy something for entertainment, because they have no leisure at all. Therefore, if we can publish some more practical books and magazines, in other words, books and magazines that are more suitable for the needs of general readers, we are sure that there will be considerable sales, as long as the price is not very expensive.</p>
<p>Now is an era when the vast majority of people are experiencing economic panic. One out of thousands can afford a book of ten, dozens, or even hundreds of yuan, but this does not mean that the general readers do not need to read books. Therefore, in addition to letting those large-scale companies publish large books, small-scale bookstores should try their best to publish some small things. We cannot despise them because of their small size, as long as they are well-made, then what does it matter if they are small? Moreover, today there are few people who can have time to read books, and even fewer people who can have enough time to read books. Most of them spare a little time after work or after class. Therefore, it is most suitable for us to publish small magazines and books that are easy to buy and easy to read.</p>
<p>As for running a magazine, many people curse the proliferation of Chinese magazines today, but I don't think so. Not many of the magazines we have now are good, and the rest are all waste materials. They are just black words printed on white paper. The emptiness of the content, the lack of pure purpose, the loss of focus in selection, the shallowness of the works, and following the crowd make people feel bored. May I ask how many magazines can exceed 2,000 copies? Are they just occupying a gap in the book market in vain, letting the purchasers sneer at them? Then, if we run another meaningful magazine, can we still think it is too much? And magazines are comprehensive and fresh, easy for the publisher to run (which means easier than those large books, but it is still very difficult to run them well), and convenient for the readers to choose, easy to read, and can immediately seize newly happened things to elaborate and explain, which is what single books cannot do. Then, further, what kind of magazine do we want? We still have some magazines about domestic and foreign politics, economy, and diplomacy. We should pay attention to scientific aspects, such as social science, physics and chemistry, etc. But the main condition is that the articles should take into account the readers' level, so as not to make people have a headache after reading them. They should be written in a fluent and clear style, that is, the so-called popular science articles today. The author is only doing a kind of enlightenment work, leading the readers to a correct path, and then letting them discover and explore their own future land.</p>
<p>There are a few more opinions written below:</p>
<p>Our publishing industry now—especially the news industry—has shifted its focus from a small number of people to the majority. This is a gratifying thing. I think we may as well try to run a new type of newspaper, but although it is slightly the same as the newspaper in nature, it also combines the advantages of magazines, that is, after recording the facts, it explains them in a more selective way. I think reading the newspaper is a major event every day, and the newspaper is the most difficult thing to read. People with a lot of cultivation can understand everything, but people without cultivation can't grasp anything after reading it, which is equivalent to not reading it. From the standpoint of culture, this kind of publication gives readers a little knowledge every day, and it can be quite impressive after accumulating for a year. People's knowledge is purely gained in imperceptible, daily accumulation, and I believe it will definitely have a large sales volume. Because readers can range from college students (because their knowledge is mostly empty) to shop assistants and rickshaw pullers.</p>
<p>The second is to obtain specialized effects with the nature of magazines. For example, we focus on Japanese research and publish a volume every ten days or every half month to introduce Japan's national conditions or the trends of Japan's national power. The main thing is to purely focus on Japan (for example, discussions on Sino-Japanese relations and Soviet-Japanese relations can also be included) so that readers can obtain some specialized knowledge with the ability, time, and energy to read magazines.</p>
<p>Also, we can meet the needs of readers in various units and run various types of publications. For example, focusing on college and middle school students, the most important thing at present is things like tools, such as foreign languages. The pricing of "Japanese Language and Japanese" in Beiping is very high, but sales are very good every issue, and the sales scope is only limited to North China. It can be seen from this that the demand for such tool publications among readers is high and the vision of the publishers is correct. In addition, French, German, Russian, etc. can be organized. Our culture is backward, and we need to learn from foreign countries. Foreign languages ​​are extremely needed for us now. Taking English as an example, the English Weekly published by Commercial Press and China Press, although very boring, also has more than 10,000 readers. If our publishers are willing to make money and also do a career that contributes a little to Chinese culture, this is a meaningful way to make money. In addition, it is also necessary to organize various magazines targeting children, targeting women, etc.</p>
<p>In summary, my opinion is entirely for small-scale publishing agencies, and it is also a summary of the following meaning; our cultural gains from the May Fourth Movement to the present are still very poor. Are there not many college students who do not know Abyssinia and think that Harbin is a place in Russia? We need to do another enlightenment work. The object of this enlightenment work should not be limited to the intellectual class and the upper class, but should be popularized to the entire people. Therefore, I advocate running magazines, running new types of news publications, and running publications that harvest specialized effects.</p>
<p>Our publishing industry has always been one-sided. Seeing that A makes profits by publishing humorous publications, B also publishes collections of humorous works, and C also publishes selections of humorous masterpieces. Seeing that others publish textbooks, they also scramble to publish textbooks. But the only one who benefits is the first one who started it. The rest either lose money or sell it at a discount, as waste paper. Why don't shrewd publishers go to discover and develop their own new continent?</p>
<p>There is also the issue of pricing. I think it should be low. Whether a magazine is successful or not does not depend on the pricing, but on the number of readers it gains. A copy of (Sarurr'ay Evering Post) in New York only costs five cents, which is not even half the cost of the paper, but Hearst (S Harst) earns tens of millions of dollars a year because of it. The reason is that it has a large number of readers, and on the other hand, it receives a lot of advertising revenue. And the amount of advertising depends on the number of readers. Publishers are initially afraid of losing money, so they try to raise the price as much as possible. Little do they know that raising the price is a kind of suicide for publishers.</p>
<p>My meaning stops here. Judging from the current magazine-ization of the news industry and the news-ization of magazines, these speculations of mine may not be wrong.</p>
<h3>Discussion of Book and Newspaper Introductions</h3>
<p>— Leng Feng</p>
<p>Most publications have a column called "Book and Newspaper Introductions," which evaluates publications from the publishing industry one by one, allowing readers to use these evaluations as a reference when purchasing books. This is an excellent thing. Because the number of publications from the publishing industry is increasing rapidly, with Commercial Press releasing two or three new books daily, and other bookstores releasing three or four, or even a dozen, each month. The number of new publications in a month can truly fill houses to the point where even oxen sweat to carry them. Among these numerous publications, there will naturally be both good and bad. If no one sets standards and evaluates each one, readers will inevitably buy many inferior books, wasting valuable money and precious time, which is simply not worth it. Therefore, although "Book and Newspaper Introductions" holds a subordinate position in each publication, its importance is self-evident.</p>
<p>The author of book and newspaper introductions bears a great mission. Standing as a critic, they guide writers on the path they should take; they hold the key to profitability and losses in the publishing industry, acting as the driver of the cultural train, indicating the direction the publishing industry should take. Therefore, writing book and newspaper introductions is not a task that anyone can handle. Because they must understand the state of society, the trends of the times, and the detailed content of the publications. Moreover, they must use an impartial, sincere, and objective attitude to provide earnest introductions, so that readers can understand the exact good and bad qualities of a book after reading their words; so that writers can understand the shortcomings of their own works and make improvements after reading their words; and so that the publishing industry can understand whether they are contributing to culture after reading their words. If an author of book and newspaper introductions can fully achieve this level in their writing, then it can be said that their words are truly pearls of wisdom. However, how do current authors of book and newspaper introductions measure up? Aren't they far from this expectation?</p>
<p>Currently, authors of book and newspaper introductions are either relatives or friends of the writers, or they have financial relationships with the publishing industry. Therefore, the introductory texts they write mostly consist of slippery, perfunctory words, which have no real impact on the publications. Before writing an introduction, they don't even expend the energy to carefully read the publication from beginning to end. At most, they look at the table of contents, the preface, and get a general overview of the publication's beginning and end. Because they are not sincerely writing introductions, they don't see the need to carefully examine the publications; and because they don't carefully examine the publications, the words they write are neither incisive nor perfunctory. Such introductory texts are as good as useless, merely soiling a few pieces of white paper, and are fundamentally without benefit to the cultural world. Therefore, the general run of book and newspaper introduction articles are such that no one even glances at them. Although there may be one or two valuable articles among them, they are not noticed by the general public because gold dust is mixed in with the sand.</p>
<p>It seems that very few publications are completely without flaws, just like even the most beautiful woman may have a scar or a mole on her face. Now, when we flip through book and newspaper introduction articles, nine out of ten praise the publication as excellent. It is clearly written "with a faithful pen," and even when the author's writing is very difficult to understand, the introductory text always says that it is "fluent and easy to read." Such authors of book and newspaper introductions are no different from old-fashioned matchmakers who introduce marriages, using their silver tongues and flowery words to describe a dark-skinned woman with pockmarks as a celestial being, dazzling the eyes. People believe their introductions and are fooled once or twice, but they will never be fooled again. Therefore, in the current sluggish state of the book industry, no matter how excellent you praise a book in the book and newspaper introduction, it will not arouse the reader's enthusiasm for purchasing because they have lost faith in the introductory texts. Many publishing merchants understand this, so when a new book is published, the advertising text only states the general content of the book, without excessively praising it. Yes, from now on, it is wrong for book and newspaper introduction texts to simply flatter a publication. It must be reformed. Don't write introductory texts with the aim of broadening the sales channels for authors and publishers; instead, write introductory texts with the aim of preventing readers from being deceived when purchasing books. In other words, the author of introductory texts should stand on the reader's side, not on the side of the author and publisher. I sincerely hope that the gentlemen who write book and newspaper introduction texts can realize this point. This is not only fortunate for the readers, but also for the entire future of culture!</p>
<h3>### Reading "An Overview of Yuan Dynasty Drama"</h3>
<p>— Shen Shengshi</p>
<p>Published by Commercial Press, written by He Changqun, price 40 cents</p>
<p>This is a thin treatise on the study of Yuan Dynasty drama. After reading it, I felt that in the first four chapters, the author explored the origins of Yuan Dynasty drama from a historical perspective, seemingly with great effort. These are rarely seen in other books on the study of Yuan Dynasty drama. The author also said in their own preface: "... However, the author is confident that this book explores the origins of Song and Yuan Dynasty opera from foreign music and dance. Although it is not very satisfactory in this aspect, it is still something that Mr. Wang Guowei and most current researchers of Song and Yuan Dynasty opera have not mentioned..."</p>
<p>However, I think that exploring and narrating from a historical perspective, and placing it in "An Overview of Yuan Dynasty Drama," seems a little inappropriate. In a "Literary Overview," one cannot talk about literary history. In a "Novel Principles" or "Poetry Principles," one should not mix in the historical part, but this kind of mixing is common.</p>
<p>Since this "An Overview of Yuan Dynasty Drama" includes historical exploration and narration, and also includes "Techniques" and "Writers," if the title of the book were "Research on Yuan Dynasty Drama" and a little more material could be added, readers might find it more satisfactory.</p>
<p>Whether the seventh chapter of this book, "Yuan Dynasty Drama Writers," should be included in "An Overview" is not mentioned further; although it is an overview, it seems that the narration of scattered songs is too brief, so brief that one can hardly find anything about them. When it comes to short lyrics, there is only the sentence "Among the Yuan Dynasty people who were good at this, Zhang Xiaoshan was the most famous," and Zhang Kejiu's alias is also written. If one is not familiar with Xiaoshan as Zhang Kejiu's alias, it seems a little inconvenient to read.</p>
<p>On page 132, in the section on Guan Hanqing, it says that Guan has 13 extant plays. It should be 14, still missing Jun Dayin's Judicious Examination of the Scarlet Robe Dream.</p>
<p>On page 141, in the section on Bai Pu, it says that Bai Pu wrote 16 varieties of plays, but only 2 remain. Most other literary histories say 15. It may be that the play Jin Fengqin is also listed among varieties of plays because this Jin Fengqin is listed in Yuan Sun Jichang's Collection of Poetic Names of Varieties of Plays and Ming Shen Boying's Collection of Poetic Names of Varieties of Plays. Recently, Zhao Jingshen had a textual research article on Bai Pu's Jin Fengchai, researching that it is not a variety of play (the article was published in Ziyoutan). Perhaps it is not Jin Fengchai but another variety of play because I have not seen it, so I dare not speak nonsense casually.</p>
<p>In addition, Shang Zhongxian is now known to have written 11 types of plays, but this book only mentions 10; Qin Jianfu is now known to have written 5 types of plays, but this book only mentions 4 varieties of plays, of which 2 extant types. Also, Qiao Ji (also known as Qiao Jifu) has 11 types of plays, of which 3 are extant, but this book says he wrote 8 types of plays. Other items have not been checked one by one, but it seems that there are still omissions.</p>

<h3>### Five Points of First Aid Knowledge</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>(5) Intoxication (i.e., alcohol poisoning)</p>
<p>Those who are habitually fond of drinking will inevitably suffer from chronic intoxication in the future. This is beyond the scope of this article. Acute intoxication has approximately two pathways. One is due to excessive drinking without restraint, leading to severe drunkenness. The other is due to suicidal intentions out of shortsightedness. Those with a naturally low alcohol tolerance will become intoxicated once they drink too much. The symptoms include a pale face and red skin, nausea and vomiting, excessive talking and quarreling, and falling into a stupor. In severe cases, it can lead to immediate sudden death due to paralysis of the brain nerves and cessation of blood circulation and breathing. Mild cases will wake up on their own after half a day or a day, but they often leave behind hangover symptoms such as fatigue and headache.</p>
<p>Those with mild intoxication can apply a cold compress to their head to promote rapid awakening. Severe cases should be treated with utmost seriousness. It is advisable to seek medical attention immediately or send them to a hospital. In an emergency, stomach pumping and enemas can be performed, and warm, strong tea can be given to mitigate the situation while awaiting medical treatment.</p>
<h3>### The Suffering of Patients with Kidney Atrophy</h3>
<p>— Dr. Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>Patient Yang Muzhou works in a certain institution and has a wide circle of friends. He also has many interactions with women, inevitably overworking himself, and subsequently suffering from kidney atrophy. His girlfriends have all added a look of disdain. He is very distressed and recklessly takes stimulants, worsening his condition and leading to neurasthenia. His spirit is decadent, his memory is weak, his mood is bad, and his emotions are volatile. He often has pessimistic thoughts. Later, he was introduced to me for diagnosis and treatment by his close friend Xu. I injected him with a large dose of Steinach's Rejuvenation Extract, and he immediately felt his reproductive glands active and strong, his vitality flourishing, his spirit full, and his kidneys powerful. His former girlfriends have restored their affection. It is said that an engagement will be arranged soon.</p>
<h3>### Questions on Quitting Smoking and Recuperation</h3>
<p>— Dr. Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>Habits are deeply ingrained in people and difficult to change, especially quitting smoking. Smokers are accustomed to inhaling and exhaling, finding it necessary to invigorate their spirits. Once forced by circumstances to quit, they will inevitably experience a variety of ailments and unbearable suffering. Therefore, the method of recuperation is essential for those who quit smoking.</p>
<p>Mr. Shi Futang, a person who quit smoking, had a deep smoking addiction. In order to quit as soon as possible, he went to the hospital to quit smoking. Unfortunately, symptoms such as headaches, insomnia, constipation, and loss of appetite arose in succession, requiring frequent medication to cope with. Later, he was introduced to me by Mr. Shang Liwen. I diagnosed that Mr. Shi's life had changed due to quitting smoking, and his endocrine system was also disordered, leading to multiple illnesses. Therefore, I instructed him to take Rejuvenation Extract for recuperation. More than a month has passed, and he has not experienced a single symptom. Moreover, he feels healthier and more cheerful than during his smoking period.</p>
<h3>### Those with Nocturnal Emissions Often Suffer from Brain Diseases and Neurasthenia</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yu Bofu</p>
<p>Essence is formed from blood, and the brain is nourished by essence. Therefore, those with weak blood will have thin essence, and those with depleted essence will have weak brains. Consequently, symptoms such as insomnia, forgetfulness, dizziness, and blurred vision arise simultaneously. Those who suffer from nocturnal emissions gradually deplete their essence, and their brains also weaken. Therefore, the nervous system is unable to communicate properly, and the whole body exhibits signs of weakness. The treatment method for nocturnal emissions is to first consolidate the essence. Hemei's Essence Consolidating Pills are the main treatment. Replenishing essence, nourishing the brain, replenishing blood, and nourishing the marrow depend on Rejuvenation Extract. Rejuvenation Extract is not only the best choice among tonics, but also has the most appropriate therapeutic function for neurasthenia.</p>
<h3>### Case Records of Kidney Disease Treatment</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yu Bofu</p>
<p>(Clinic) Room 5, 2nd Floor, China Trust Company Building, Intersection of Sichuan Road and Beijing Road</p>
<p>(1) Yellowish Complexion, Emaciated Body, and Fatigue</p>
<p>Patient Jiang Qinzhai, 38 years old, from Jingde, porcelain industry. Due to the heavy workload, he brought many ailments upon himself, resulting in excessive labor. In terms of diet, his intake of nutrients was also insufficient, leading to a thin and weak body. Three years ago, he vomited blood due to injury, resulting in a sallow complexion. Although the vomiting of blood stopped, his body could not recover in any way. He consulted both Chinese and Western doctors for treatment, but to no avail. He bought and took certain tonic pills, but it was like a stone sinking into the sea. Last year, he came to Shanghai and entrusted a certain doctor to inject several doses of Saibao Ming, but the effect was minimal. Later, he was introduced by the Shenbao Medical Journal and came to me for treatment. I observed that Mr. Jiang had blood deficiency and emaciation, malnutrition, and endocrine deficiency. Therefore, I instructed him to purchase Steinach's Rejuvenation Extract from Sino-Western pharmacies. After taking half a dozen, he immediately felt well-nourished, his endocrine system was full, his blood was strong, his muscles were firm, and his complexion was ruddy. Even after hard work, he did not feel the slightest fatigue.</p>
<p>(2) Treatment of Nocturnal Emissions and Wet Dreams</p>
<p>Patient Qu Kanghou, 21 years old, from Zhenhai, money exchange industry. When he was 14 years old in school, he was induced by bad classmates to pretend to be husband and wife with a certain female classmate. Over time, they gradually became intimate. The girl was three years older than Qu. After two years, the girl married, but they still secretly met. Later, he learned that the girl was a prostitute, but he had already lost his virginity to her, and it was too late. At 18 years old, he came to Shanghai. What he saw and heard inevitably moved him. He could not help but recall the past with the girl, which manifested in his dreams. He suffered from wet dreams. Later, in a daze, he had emissions even without dreams. He had taken kidney-tonifying pills, but unexpectedly they were stimulants, which worsened his condition. Last winter, he came to me for treatment. I observed that Mr. Qu had local deformities caused by masturbation. His seminal vesicle had loosened, and he was also suffering from adolescent gland deficiency. Therefore, I instructed him to take both Rejuvenation Extract and Hemei's Essence Consolidating Pills. After more than two months, his nocturnal emissions were eradicated. His adolescent gland deficiency was also well-treated.</p>
<p>(Note) Dr. Yu's consultation hours are from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM, closed on Sundays.</p>
<h3>### A Case of Premature Aging Cured</h3>
<p>— Manuscript by Han Runsen</p>
<p>I am currently 33 years old. Two months ago, everyone thought that I must be between 45 and 46 years old. My complexion was sallow, my wrinkles were crisscrossed, and my appearance was like that of an old man on the verge of death. And I myself suffered from lower back pain, dizziness, blurred vision, forgetfulness, insomnia, fatigue, and aversion to labor, like a sickly and weak body. The cause of this is difficult to explain in one word. It was mainly caused by malnutrition and post-illness imbalance. Later, I consulted Dr. Yu Bofu, who diagnosed that I had an endocrine deficiency, leading to neurasthenia. He instructed me to purchase the endocrine preparation Rejuvenation Extract from Jicheng Pharmacy and take it. I followed his instructions and took four boxes in a row, and it was indeed very effective. My skin regained its elasticity, my wrinkles disappeared, my blood became abundant, my complexion became ruddy, my whole body became strong, my lower back became powerful, my muscles developed, and my spirit became vigorous. I looked like a young man of 27 or 28 years old again. Alas, Rejuvenation Extract is truly the supreme savior for patients with weakness!</p>
<h3>### Self-Healing for Youth Ailments</h3>
<p>— Manuscript by Ouyang Shangde</p>
<p>When I was 15 years old, I was poisoned by obscene books and committed the secret bad habits of ordinary young people. When I realized this at 18 years old, I quit. I was already suffering from nocturnal emissions. I got married in the winter of 19 and discovered that I also suffered from premature ejaculation. A hundred ailments arose, and the suffering was extraordinary. My vitality was cut off, and there was no hope for offspring. This spring, I went to Dr. Ren Guoxiang for treatment. He prescribed Hemei's Essence Consolidating Pills to treat my nocturnal emissions and Rejuvenation Extract to treat my premature ejaculation. In about two months, all the symptoms disappeared, and I regained my original health. My strength was a hundred times greater than before. Now, my wife is already pregnant. Although I do not know whether it will be a boy or a girl, I will never forget the efficacy of this medicine.</p>
<h3>### Treatment of Stomach Disorders</h3>
<p>— Dr. Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>There are many types of stomach disorders. The ones that are directly noticeable include loss of appetite, acid regurgitation, stomach cold, and stomach pain. Among them, patients with food stagnation and indigestion are the most numerous. If food stays in the stomach without digesting, it often causes bad breath and constipation. Patients often overlook this, leading to malnutrition throughout the body, affecting their health. This is truly regrettable.</p>
<p>For the treatment of various stomach disorders, for those with stomach illness and stomach pain, Stomach Pain Elixir can be taken for treatment. For those with weak stomach and loss of appetite, Stomach Nourishing Pills can be taken to nourish it. These two medicines complement each other, and all stomach symptoms are not worth worrying about.</p>
<h3>### Common Ailments of Women</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zhou Xiaohan</p>
<p>Women's constitution is weaker than men's, and their resistance to disease is less. Therefore, they also suffer from more ailments. They often have irregular menstruation, reddish-white vaginal discharge, etc., which they consider hidden ailments and keep secret. As husbands, they have the responsibility to protect them, but they are often indifferent, allowing the illness to linger. Only when the illness becomes serious do they seek medical treatment in a panic, wasting time and effort. This is truly lamentable.</p>
<p>Patient Jin Wu, from Xuzhou, had irregular periods, sometimes early, sometimes late, sometimes heavy, sometimes light, sometimes dark, and also suffered from white vaginal discharge for many years, keeping it a secret and never telling Jin Wuying. Therefore, her body gradually became frail. She had been married for many years without giving birth. This spring, because the discharge was red, she finally told her husband in a panic. Jin Wuying accompanied her to me for treatment. I observed that her uterus was inflamed and her vagina was eroded. It was not enough to treat it internally and externally. I instructed her to purchase "Rejuvenation Extract for Women" from Anliss Trading Company for internal use and to use Leudailing externally according to the instructions. After more than a month, she was completely cured. Her white discharge disappeared, her periods became regular, and her menstrual blood became red. This autumn, Mr. Jin introduced his friend to treat other ailments. According to him, his wife is already three months pregnant, and her body is strong and healthy, far from what it used to be.</p>
<h3>### Questions and Answers on Ailments</h3>
<p>(Manuscripts must include a detailed address and return postage)</p>
<p>Winter Tonic</p>
<p>Cai Junde asks: At the turn of autumn and winter, I usually take tonics every year. However, in the past, I have tried various tonics, but their efficacy is minimal. I have long admired your publication's medical expertise and extensive experience. Please introduce one.</p>
<p>(Answer) For winter tonics, Rejuvenation Extract, which combines the replenishment of essence, blood, brain, and marrow, is the best. It is gentle in nature and fast in efficacy.</p>
<p>Nocturnal Emissions and Essence Depletion</p>
<p>Luo Xishi asks: I have been masturbating for years. Although I have quit, I often suffer from nocturnal emissions, as many as more than 20 times a month. Now my essence is depleted, and the amount of emissions is far less than before. Please advise on treatment.</p>
<p>(Answer) You should take Hemei's Essence Consolidating Pills to consolidate the seminal vesicle and treat nocturnal emissions, and also take Rejuvenation Extract to replenish your essence.</p>
<p>Belching after Every Meal</p>
<p>Zhai Rongkun asks: I have a weak stomach and often suffer from regurgitation. I vomit immediately after eating. The pain is unspeakable. Please advise on treatment.</p>
<p>(Answer) You can hope that Stomach Pain Elixir will treat it, and also take Stomach Nourishing Pills to nourish it.</p>
<p>Weak Body and Vaginal Discharge</p>
<p>Li Shuren asks: My wife has a weak body and has had white vaginal discharge for years. Is there any medicine that she can use to treat it at home?</p>
<p>(Answer) Use Leudailing externally and Rejuvenation Extract for Women internally.</p>
<p>(Note) Rejuvenation Extract for Women can be purchased directly from Anliss Trading Company. The Rejuvenation Extract sold in pharmacies is for men.</p>
<h3>### Case Report of Sex Disease Treatment</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yao Erchang, Medical Doctor of the University of Pennsylvania, USA</p>
<p>Recuperation from Weakness after Illness</p>
<p>Patient Zhou Furen, 42 years old, from Pingjiang, business world. (Chief complaint)——Weak body after recovering from a serious illness. (Medical history)——Inherited from his parents at a young age, he was congenitally deficient and extremely weak. He also lacked resistance to diseases. In the three years of 17, 25, and 40 years old, he suffered from a serious illness each time, bordering on death. The one in the year before last was the most ferocious, a narrow escape from death. He suffered from typhoid fever with excessive bleeding, resulting in anemia, sallow complexion, and emaciated muscles. Fortunately, he escaped from the grasp of death, but he could not recover for a while after the illness. He took prescriptions prescribed by both Chinese and Western doctors, but they were not very effective. After lingering for more than a year, he was introduced to me by Mr. Hu Zipei this spring. (Current symptoms)——Anemia, imbalance after illness, weakness, fatigue, lower back pain. (Treatment)——Prescribed the endocrine preparation "Rejuvenation Extract" to replenish his essence, blood, brain, and marrow. After about two months, his complexion became ruddy, his blood became abundant, his weight increased, his muscles became strong, and he felt stronger than before the illness. His lower back became powerful, and his spirit was a hundred times better.</p>
<h3>### Frequent Nocturnal Emissions Cause Multiple Illnesses</h3>
<p>Patient Shao Changgeng, 23 years old, from Fuyang, paper industry. (Chief complaint)——Nocturnal emissions, multiple illnesses, weak brain, insomnia. (Medical history)——Began to masturbate six years ago. The reason was caused by unrequited love. At first, he thought it was the pain of lovesickness and used this to comfort himself. It was a good plan, but unexpectedly his body became weaker day by day. He felt dizzy, had blurred vision, and suffered from insomnia at night and forgetfulness during the day. The suffering was unbearable. He began to force himself to quit. Before a month had passed, he suddenly suffered from nocturnal emissions. By the 19th year, the history of nocturnal emissions was frequent, as many as three or four times a week. His physical strength could not support it. He consulted doctors and took medicine, which seemed to be effective but not. He still had seven or eight nocturnal emissions every month. By the year before last, the condition worsened. He had emissions even without dreams. His head felt dizzy and painful. He could not sleep peacefully at night. His memory was weak during the day, and he could not concentrate on thinking. His lower back ached, and his spirit was weak, becoming a thin and sickly man. Later, he was instructed by Mr. Shao's cousin to come to me for diagnosis and treatment. (Current symptoms)——Essence depletion, weak brain, insomnia, forgetfulness. (Treatment)——Hemei's Essence Consolidating Pills were used to treat his nocturnal emissions, and they were eradicated within a month without recurring. He was also instructed to take "Rejuvenation Extract" for recuperation. After taking five boxes, the ailments disappeared as if they had been lost. He could sleep peacefully at night. His brain was clear and healthy. His thoughts were also well-organized. His whole body was strong and full, like a different person than before.</p>

<p>Publication Commemorating the Completion of the New School Building of Guangdong Provincial Secondary School</p>
<h3>Foreword</h3>
<p>— Wu Tiecheng</p>
<p>The expansion of our school's new school building has been in operation for several years. The first phase of construction has now been completed. The buildings are brand new, the grand scale is vast, and many talented scholars come with their book bags. All the children of Guangdong and the talented people from all directions can receive a good education. This is what our colleagues are deeply fortunate about. However, talents must be widely cultivated, and education should seek its development every day. Although the foundation has been laid, the studies have not been completed. The construction has just begun, and a hundred things remain to be done. After this, funds will be raised to maintain it permanently, and vocational subjects will be added to cultivate practical talents. The scale must be perfected, and the progress must not be hindered by difficulties. The responsibilities borne by our colleagues are both heavy and great. We especially hope that the benevolent local gentry and the distinguished people of society will guide and assist us, and jointly gather the great cause, and achieve success. It is not only the fortune of the children of Guangdong, but also the welfare of the future of education.</p>

<h3>The Process of Constructing the New School Building of This School</h3>
<p>Respectfully narrated by Principal Lu Songqian</p>
<p>In this era of national tribulation and societal decline, the first phase of our school's new building project has actually been completed. The reason why the first phase of the project could be completed is directly due to the support of the enthusiastic elders and fellow villagers who care about education, and indirectly due to the encouragement and inspiration from all sectors of society. Therefore, we were able to achieve the expected goals in an environment full of difficulties. This is something that the colleagues of this school and the children of our fellow villagers from Guangdong who are living in Shanghai will never forget. Now that the initial phase of the project is completed and the new school building is holding its opening ceremony, it is truly impossible not to record the past events that were full of hardships. For the convenience of explanation, I will divide the process into five periods, from 1930 to August 1935, and respectfully describe them as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Incubation Period – January to December 1930</p>
<p>In recent years, the number of our fellow villagers from Guangdong living in Shanghai has been increasing day by day due to the progress of politics, economy, commerce, and industry in this city, reaching about 200,000 or more. According to the ratio of the total population to school-age children, calculated at 15%, there should be more than 30,000 people. These more than 30,000 children who should be educated mostly choose schools established by fellow villagers as the standard for their school selection due to age, language, habits, and convenience of cultivation. Therefore, in recent years, the schools established by our fellow villagers from Guangdong in Shanghai have been developing day by day. The original school building of our school can only accommodate 600 people, but we have had to accommodate more than 1,000 people. Although it is already very crowded, there are still many people who want to enter the school. At that time, our school already had an 18-year history, and the elders and fellow villagers had high expectations for our school, and frequently hoped that we would expand the number of students and add a senior high school. According to records at that time, a total of 120 people expressed this opinion in writing (the original letter can be found in the 6th issue of the Kapok, a publication previously published by our school), and countless people expressed it orally. The colleagues of our school, in order to live up to the expectations of the elders and fellow villagers, planned to raise funds to build a new site. As soon as the proposal was finalized, even before it was announced to the outside world, Mr. Yan Lin, an elder fellow villager who was enthusiastic about education, heard about it and immediately donated one thousand yuan, saying, "A little help for the construction of the new school." His enthusiasm for righteousness and courage made the colleagues of our school very excited. Therefore, we sought opinions from all sides and prepared to take active action, and compiled and printed a special publication on the expansion plan, explaining the purpose of building a new school building; and also listed the deeds of our predecessors Yang Sisheng, Cheng Zhong, Feng Pingshan, Chen Jiageng and others who donated funds to establish schools, in order to inform those who care about education in the world. Since the release of our school's expansion plan, all fellow villagers have expressed their support, and Mr. Wen Qinfu and others from the board of directors of the Guangzhao Public Association, Mr. Lin Yibo and others, parents of students, have given strong guidance and encouragement to its implementation.</p>
<p>(2) The Budding Period – January to December 1931</p>
<p>After the release of the expansion plan, our school held an art achievement exhibition in January 1931, inviting fellow villagers and people from all walks of life to visit. We wanted to present the work achievements of our school's students to the advanced people who usually care about the situation of our school, hoping to get their criticism and guidance, and to help the implementation of our school's expansion plan. At that time, Mr. Tang Shaochuan, Mr. Chen Bingqian, Mr. Wen Qinfu and other directors of the Guangzhao Public Association, and Mr. Xu Shisong and others visited the school, and all expressed satisfaction. Mr. Chen Bingqian especially strongly supported our school's expansion plan and generously took charge of it. He immediately asked Songqian to go to the Shuidaidian Road area of Jiangwan to select a new school site; he often visited the school to discuss the site issue, and gave many instructions with his great vision and insights. The colleagues of our school were further encouraged by Mr. Chen's encouragement. During this period, Songqian, the architect Li Jinpei, and various teachers and staff members repeatedly inspected the site of the new school building, and visited many new buildings of Chinese and foreign schools in the city for reference. In the spring of that year, Mr. Chen Bingqian began to purchase a new school site for our school, working hard day and night, and with the assistance of Mr. Yang Runzhi, Mr. Cui Pinxi and others, the progress was very rapid. However, the school site must be contiguous land, and it is not easy to purchase it suddenly, because the landowners are different, some are unwilling to sell, some deliberately hoard it for speculation, the situation is complicated, and it is difficult to handle. It is known that it will not be successful without relying on the power of the government. Therefore, in August of this year, we submitted a request to the Shanghai Municipal Government to consult the Ministry of the Interior to approve the expropriation of private land according to law. However, the procedures are cumbersome and cannot be completed in a short time. Therefore, we submitted a request to the government on the one hand, and started fundraising in stages on the other, in order to advance on both sides and see the completion as soon as possible. Mr. Tang Baoshu, a school director, was particularly enthusiastic and had previously raised 20,000 yuan from Mr. Xu Wenliang, and agreed to hand it over during the appropriate period of construction. His enthusiasm for education is truly admirable.</p>
<p>(3) The Stagnation Period – January to May 1932</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident in 1931, due to the serious national crisis, people's hearts were unsettled, and with the January 28th Incident, this city was the first to bear the brunt, all industries were declining, and people's lives were haggard. Our school was in this difficult situation, and the expansion plan was invisibly stalled. However, education to save the country is the key plan, and our colleagues have been working day and night, never slacking off their responsibilities for a day.</p>
<p>(4) The Realization Period – June 1932 to May 1934 On June 24, 1932, at the board meeting of the Guangzhao Public Association, Director Tang Baoshu proposed that the construction of the new school building of our school had a considerable foundation, and proposed that the Public Association allocate 40,000 yuan for construction costs to promote its completion. Director Wen Qinfu seconded the proposal, and it was unanimously approved. The expansion plan of our school has become increasingly realized. On July 11, Mr. Wen Qinfu and others from the Guangzhao Public Association wrote to Mayor Wu Tiecheng, requesting him to serve as the chairman of the fundraising committee for the construction of our school building. Mayor Wu Tiecheng gladly accepted and took it as his own responsibility. He also hired fellow villagers who were enthusiastic about education as members of the fundraising committee, and elected Mr. Tang Shaochuan and Mr. Sun Zhesheng as honorary chairmen. Later, Mr. Chen Bingqian and Mr. Guo Dun were publicly elected as vice chairmen of the fundraising committee to assist the chairman in presiding over the committee affairs, and they all agreed. On July 27, Chairman Wu convened the first meeting at the Guangzhao Public Association. The attendees were very enthusiastic and had a detailed discussion on the progress of the committee affairs. The fundraising committee's charter was also finalized and reported to the Education Bureau for submission to the municipal government for approval and record. For the convenience of handling affairs, the following committees were established: the Education Design Committee, chaired by Mr. Wen Qinfu; the Construction Committee, chaired by Mr. Guo Le; the Finance Committee, chaired by Mr. Chen Bingqian; and the Land Purchase Committee, chaired by Mr. Guo Shun. Mr. Li Dachao, Mr. Tang Baoshu, Mr. Feng Bingnan, Mr. Zhou Qingquan, Mr. Cui Pinxi, Mr. Lao Jingxiu, Mr. Yang Meinan, Mr. Yang Runzhi, Mr. Li Zhaohuan, Mr. Huang Huannan, Mr. Tan Rongpu, Mr. Cai Chang, and Mr. Situ Shangsang were elected as executive committee members, and Songqian was elected as the general manager. Each had their own responsibilities, and they were responsible for their own tasks. With everyone working together, it was certain that they would be successful together. The chairman and all the committee members were extremely enthusiastic and spared no effort in raising funds. Our school also compiled and printed a glimpse of the achievements of Guangzhao Middle School and distributed it to various fellow villagers to help raise funds. On October 20, Chairman Wu, accompanied by Mr. Guo Shun and Mr. Feng Bingnan, went to Mr. Zheng Bozhao to solicit donations, and Mr. Zheng generously agreed to donate 50,000 yuan. Our school benefited greatly from this large sum of money, and it was not insignificant. All fellow villagers also stepped forward and donated generously. Wing On Company and Wing On Textile Company each donated 10,000 yuan, and in January 1933, the Guangdong Provincial Government subsidized 10,000 yuan. The Fundraising Committee decided that the donation amount would be 500,000 yuan, and half of it had already been raised. The enthusiasm of the fellow villagers for education is truly admirable! At the first plenary meeting of the fundraising committee, it was resolved that in addition to the 18 acres of land donated by Mr. Chen Bingqian in the name of Chen Yancan, an additional 32 acres would be purchased, making a total of 50 acres. By the time the third plenary meeting was held, it was agreed that in order to implement production education and facilitate future expansion, it was necessary to find ways to purchase more school land. It was resolved to purchase an additional 150 acres of school land, making a total of 200 acres. Immediately, a plan and various drawings were drawn up and sent to the Land and Education Bureaus for review and submission to the Municipal Government, requesting the Ministry of the Interior to approve the expropriation according to law for construction purposes. After several detailed investigations by the Land and Education Bureaus, it was approved for submission for review and handling, and it was not until August 18, 1933, that it was fully approved by the Ministry of the Interior. It can be seen that the government is extremely cautious in handling the application of people's organizations to circle and purchase private land. After our school's application to circle and purchase private land was approved, we contacted the landowners to purchase it. Mr. Chen Bingqian was entrusted by the conference to be responsible for handling this matter, and with the assistance of Mr. Li Dachao, the progress was quite smooth. (For details on the process of circling and purchasing private land, please refer to page 21 of the special publication of the foundation laying of our school's new school building.) Mr. Chen, for the convenience of students traveling, jointly presented a request to the Municipal Government with Mr. Wen Qinfu and Mr. Guo Shun to build a road (ie, Tongli Road within the Zhabei Road Tea System) directly to the new school site of our school, diagonally opposite the swimming pool in Hongkou Park. The Municipal Government approved it, and our school was responsible for the construction cost of 6,700 yuan, and the land acquisition cost was paid by the municipal treasury. It was also approved by the Municipal Government to name the road Guangzhong Road (ie, Guangzhao Middle School Road) in memory. (For details on the process of building Guangzhong Road, please refer to page 24 of the special publication of the foundation laying of our school's new school building).</p>
<p>On November 20, 1933, accountant Chen Riping agreed to serve as the voluntary auditor of the Fundraising Committee and was responsible for auditing the income and expenditure. Immediately, a summary of the income and expenditure from October 1932 to March 26, 1934, was compiled and distributed to the donors and fundraisers for review, and an abstract was sent to various newspapers for advertising to show credibility.</p>
<p>(5) The First Phase Completion Period – June 1934 to August 1935</p>
<p>After the school land was purchased, construction began. In June 1934, the three architects Li Jinpei, Fan Wenzhao, and Guan Songsheng (represented by Zhu Bin) jointly drew the school building plan, and then invited bids for construction. There were a total of 20 bidders, the highest bid was 189,024 yuan, and the lowest bid was 121,450 yuan. As a result, it was contracted to Guanghua Construction Factory, with a total cost of 125,000 yuan. On July 26, the Construction Bureau issued a construction license, and construction officially started that day. Wenxue Jun was hired as the supervisor. On September 9, the foundation laying ceremony was held. More than 1,000 fellow villagers and people from all walks of life attended the ceremony. Chairman Wu personally laid the foundation stone and delivered auspicious words. He also said that our school is the largest school established by Guangdong people living in Shanghai, and the mission it bears is extremely important. It relies on the efforts and cooperation of fellow villagers. Therefore, after delivering the auspicious words, he continued with a very sincere and concise speech, which the listeners were deeply moved by. At that time, a special publication commemorating the foundation laying was compiled, detailing the process of preparing to build the school building and the plans for future progress. A list of donations was appended, bound into a book, and distributed to fellow villagers and people from all walks of life for publicity. Later, Mr. Lin Bingyan donated 60,000 yuan, and Mrs. Jian Zhaonan was persuaded by Mr. Chen Bingqian to donate 50,000 yuan. Mr. Bingyan believed that the establishment of our school was originally to cultivate the children of fellow villagers equally, but the original name Guangzhao Middle School inevitably divided the boundaries due to the name of the place. Therefore, he proposed to change the school name in order to make the name consistent with the reality. On January 10, 1935, the Fundraising Committee held its tenth plenary meeting and decided to change the school name to Guangdong East Middle School. On January 19, it was announced in the newspaper and changed to the current name. Our school was built with great difficulty and relies on the enthusiastic support of fellow villagers and people from all walks of life to establish today's scale. Its great virtues and achievements will be permanently commemorated. A large sports field in the school is named Bingyan Sports Field to commemorate Mr. Lin Bingyan. A pavilion in front of the field is built as a grandstand for guests and a place for athletes to rest. A hall and office building is named Zhaofu Hall to commemorate Mr. Jian Zhaonan. This hall was originally designated as the memorial hall for Mr. Chen Bingqian's grandfather, Xinglang, but Mr. Chen gave way to virtue and wished to move it to commemorate Mr. Jian, and our school will build a separate library to commemorate Mr. Xinglang. The entire classroom building is named Bozhao Building to commemorate Mr. Zheng Bozhao. A gymnasium is named Xu Mu Gymnasium to commemorate Mr. Xu Wenliang's grandmother. A dormitory is named Yong'an Building to commemorate Wing On Company and Wing On Textile Company. A monument is erected in a suitable location in the school. The monument is square and is divided into four sides. One side is the memorial monument for Chairman Wu, one side is the memorial monument for Mr. Chen Bingqian, one side is the memorial monument for Mr. Guo Le and Mr. Guo Shun, and one side is the memorial monument for Mr. Lin Bingyan (the inscription will be recorded separately). In addition, in various cities in China and abroad, there are people who commemorate meritorious movers with road names. The cement roads in our school are wide, clean, and shaded by trees. They are now named Shaochuan Road, Zhesheng Road, Qinfu Road, Ningshu Road, Dachao Road, Bingnan Road, Pinxi Road, Huannan Road, Weifu Road, Runzhi Road, and Zhaohuan Road to commemorate Mr. Tang Shaochuan, Mr. Sun Zhesheng, Mr. Wen Qinfu, Mr. Tang Baoshu, Mr. Li Dachao, Mr. Feng Bingnan, Mr. Cui Pinxi, Mr. Huang Huannan, Mr. Cai Chang, (Weifu) Yang Runzhi, and Mr. Li Zhaohuan. The various lecture halls are places for learning, and the students have a deep impression on them. Therefore, the various classrooms are used as memorial rooms for the various gentlemen, including Yaoting Room, Jingxiu Room, Meinan Room, Yibo Room, Yanlin Room, Qingquan Room, Hongjun Room, Rongpu Room, Shangsang Room, Yicheng Room, Shisong Room, and Riping Room to commemorate Hu Yaoting, Lao Jingxiu, Yang Meinan, Lin Yibo, Lao Yanlin, Zhou Qingquan, Yu Hongjun Tan Rongpu, Situ Shangsang, Deng Yicheng, Xu Shisong, and Chen Riping. In addition, various gentlemen who donated money will be respectfully commemorated in accordance with the regulations of our school for commemorating donors. It is a courtesy to honor virtue and repay merit in order to encourage and inspire, and it is also the will of the people. The first phase of our school's construction project was mostly completed in mid-February 1935, and the entire middle school was moved in. On the day of the start of school, Chairman Wu and the various school directors came to the school to hold a ceremony and delivered speeches. The teachers and students gathered together, which was a grand occasion for a while. By August, the first phase of the project was completely completed, and the completion ceremony was scheduled to be held on October 26. As of the end of August 1935, a total of 367,231 yuan and 55 cents had been received in donations. The titles of the gentlemen who donated money and the income and expenditure accounts are published in the commemorative album of the completion of the new school building, which is omitted here.</p>
<h3>The History of This School</h3>
<p>This newspaper was established in January 1913 and was founded by the current principal, Mr. Lu Songqian. At that time, only the elementary school department was set up, and ordinary houses in Qingyun Lane on North Sichuan Road were rented as school buildings, named Peide School. In August 1917, it was approved by the Shanghai County Office and the Shanghai Daoyin Office for filing. In February 1919, the middle school department and the kindergarten were added. In January 1921, due to financial constraints, the middle school department was temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>Starting from January 1922, it was changed to the Shanghai Guangzhao Public Association, and the school name was changed to Shanghai Guangzhao Public School. In September 1923, it moved into the self-built school building in Fudexing on the Hengbang Bridge on North Sichuan Road. In addition to the continued expansion of the elementary school department, the middle school department was also restored to run junior high school. In February 1928, it was approved by the Shanghai Special Municipal Education Bureau for filing. In August 1929, it was renamed Shanghai Special Municipal Private Guangzhao Primary and Secondary School in accordance with the order of the Municipal Education Bureau. In March 1930, it was renamed Shanghai Municipal Private Guangzhao Junior High School in accordance with the order, and the primary school department was changed to an affiliated primary school (that is, the current Guanggong First Primary School). In June 1931, it was approved by the Ministry of Education of the National Government for record. In 1932, due to the January 28th Incident, many students' families moved to West Shanghai. In order to avoid affecting the students' studies, our school rented a house at the intersection of Ximolu and Xinzha Road in the Special Zone to start school. After the incident was over, it moved back to the original school to attend classes. At the same time, due to the sharp increase in students in recent years, the primary school department was particularly crowded. Therefore, the temporary school building on Ximolu Road was added to establish the Second Affiliated Primary School (that is, the current Guanggong Second Primary School).</p>
<p>In July 1932, preparations were made to build a new school building for the middle school department, and a fundraising committee was organized to preside over it. In August 1933, the Ministry of the Interior of the National Government approved the purchase of 200 mu of private land on Shuidaidian Road in Zhabei as the school site. In July 1934, construction began. In December of the same year, the Municipal Education Bureau approved the addition of senior high school. In January 1935, it was decided by the Fundraising Committee of the school building construction of our school to change the name to Shanghai Guangdong East Middle School, and in February of the same year, it was submitted to the Municipal Education Bureau for submission to the Ministry of Education for approval and record, and it was renamed to the current name. In mid-February of the same year, the first phase of the new school building was completed, and the school was moved into the new school building for classes.</p>
<p>All the original new school buildings in Fudeli on North Sichuan Road were completely used for Guanggong First Primary School and Kindergarten.</p>
<h3>The Future Plans of This School</h3>
<p>Although the first phase of our school's construction plan has been completed, there are countless things that need to be done in the future, and it is difficult to describe them all. Now, I will extract the more important ones and list them below:</p>
<p>1. Raising the school's foundation. The school's foundation is of utmost importance. After the completion of the first phase of the construction plan of our school, we must pay attention to this. We are now starting to organize the school's fundraising committee to be responsible for the implementation. (Details of the method will be given separately.)</p>
<p>2. Adding vocational subjects. In order to implement production education, our school will add vocational subjects in stages, taking into account actual needs. Starting from the second semester of 1935, we will first open a business department, followed by engineering and agricultural departments, etc.</p>
<p>3. Adding school buildings in stages. There are no less than 20 buildings, large and small, listed on the general map of our school. The ones that have been completed are: one auditorium and office building, one church, one gymnasium, one dormitory, one dining hall, one kitchen and worker's room, one gatehouse and guard room each, one memorial pavilion and one monument each, one large sports field, two small sports fields, and eleven cement roads. The ones that are currently under construction are: one library. The ones that are about to be built are: one dormitory. In addition, there are three classrooms, two dormitories, two factories, one swimming pool, and two grandstands in the sports field. We will consider building them in stages to complete the entire plan.</p>
<p>4. Continuing to purchase school land. The land that our school has approved to circle and purchase totals 208 mu, 9 fen, 6 li, and 2 hao. Only 109 mu, 5 fen, 3 li, and 2 hao have been purchased so far. The remaining amount should be purchased successively to meet the needs.</p>
<p>5. Building a new village for teachers and staff. Our school plans to set aside a part of the school land to build a new village for teachers and staff in order to solve the problem of housing for teachers and staff. (Details of the method will be given separately.)</p>
<p>6. Adding Guanggong Third Primary School. The area near our school is becoming increasingly prosperous, and there are many fellow villagers from Guangdong who live here. In the future, there will probably be even more. In order to facilitate children's schooling, our school plans to add Guanggong Third Primary School near our school at an appropriate time. (Our school has two affiliated primary schools, one in North Sichuan Road, south of Hengbang Bridge, and one in Xinzha Road, north of Ximolu, with a total of about 1,000 elementary and kindergarten students.)</p>
<p>The plans listed above include those that need to be realized in the near future or in the immediate future, and those that will take time to be completed. We should distinguish between the urgent and the less urgent, and make practical plans. In particular, we must work together to achieve success. I hope that the people of the country and gentlemen will give us guidance.</p>

<h3>Improvement of Crystal Oscillator</h3>
<p>— Jian</p>
<p>The advantage of using crystals to make oscillators is that the oscillation is relatively stable during oscillation, but one disadvantage is that during oscillation, there is a risk of damage to the crystal oscillator, which does not cause oscillation, and the whole process is quite difficult. The improved method to be introduced here is to remedy the above-mentioned shortcomings.</p>
<p>The method is to insert a crystal oscillator between the screen grid and the grid filament of the oscillation tube at the same time. As shown in the first figure, (1) is the oscillation tube, (2) is the crystal oscillator inserted between the screen grid, and (3) is the crystal oscillator inserted between the grid filament. These two oscillators must be selected with equal oscillation frequency. (4) is the screen circuit matching circuit, with a self-inductance coil (5) and an adjustable variable capacitor (6) inserted in the middle. (7) is an ammeter for measuring the current in the matching circuit (4), and (8) is an ammeter for measuring the screen current. (9) and (10) are fixed capacitors.</p>
<p>Now, when the variable capacitor of the screen matching circuit (4) is adjusted, a strong oscillation current is caused by the crystal oscillator. At this time, if the ammeter (7) is used to measure the current in the matching circuit (4), the current changes with the increase or decrease of the capacitance C of the capacitor (6) as shown in the second figure. In the figure, the vertical axis represents the matching current, and the horizontal axis represents the capacitance of the capacitor (6). The highest peaks IA and IIA each represent the current during matching. That is, if the capacitance of the capacitor (6) is small, the oscillator (3) oscillates according to the curve of 1; if the capacitance of the capacitor (6) is large, the oscillator (2) oscillates according to the curve of II.</p>
<p>Therefore, in use, if one oscillator is damaged, another oscillator can be used for oscillation, so this improved method is quite convenient for mobile communication machines and the like.</p>
<h3>New Developments in Vacuum Tubes: PC.A6E5 "Electronic Optical Adjustment Indicator Tube"</h3>
<p>— Common Words</p>
<p>Due to advancements in radio manufacturing, new radios far surpass older models in selectivity, sensitivity, and fidelity. However, a significant difficulty arises in tuning. If the tuning is not precise, sensitivity greatly diminishes and audio distortion can occur. If this difficulty cannot be overcome, even meticulously designed radios will fail to perform to their full potential due to tuning challenges.</p>
<p>The 6E5 "Electronic Optical Adjustment Indicator Tube (Electron ray indicator tube)," is a type of so-called "Tuning indicator," which enables the most accurate tuning.</p>
<p>The internal structure of the 6E5 vacuum tube is shown in the first diagram. In addition to the plate and cathode of a triode, the tube contains a special "Electron Target" and an "Electro-optical Control Electrode (ray controlelcetrode)." The electron target is coated with a luminescent material, so when connected to the positive terminal of the B battery, it absorbs electrons emitted from the cathode, causing the luminescent material to glow. The size of the glowing area is controlled by the electro-optical control electrode located between the electron target and the cathode. This electro-optical control electrode is connected to the plate of the triode section, and the grid of the triode section is connected to the automatic volume control section. Therefore, the voltage on the electro-optical control electrode is related to the automatic volume control voltage. Consequently, the area of the glowing part on the electron target is also related to the automatic volume control voltage; in other words, it changes with the signal voltage. Diagram two shows two forms of electron target luminescence. In diagram A, the tuning is incorrect, no station is received, and the glowing portion covers approximately ninety degrees. In diagram B, the tuning is quite accurate, and the angle of the glowing portion is greatly reduced. Therefore, during tuning, one need only minimize the glowing portion of the electron target.</p>
<p>Attached are the characteristics of the 6E5 vacuum tube:</p>
<p>Filament (AC or DC): 6.3 volts, 0.3 amperes</p>
<p>B Voltage: 250 volts</p>
<p>Operating Conditions:</p>
<p>Electron Target Voltage: 250 volts</p>
<p>Plate Dropping Resistor (in series): 1 million ohms</p>
<p>Electron Target Current: Approximately 4.5 milliamperes</p>
<p>Plate Current with No Grid Voltage: 0.25 milliamperes</p>
<p>Grid Voltage at 90-degree Luminescence: -8 volts</p>
<p>Grid Voltage at 0-degree Luminescence: 0 volts</p>
<p>Tube Height: 3 and 5/8 inches, Maximum Diameter: 1 and 9/16 inches, Glass Bulb: ST'12 type, Tube Socket: Small 6-pin.</p>
<h3>Two Telegraph Practice Airplanes</h3>
<p>— Hua Xin</p>
<p>Here's an introduction to a telegraph practice machine. With just a buzzer and a set of batteries, you can practice sending and receiving at the same time. The diagram above shows its circuit. The capacitor C, which is 0.5ufd, is used to block the direct current flowing from the battery into the earpiece. The audio frequency generated by the buzzer passes through C and into the earpiece. If the key and earpiece are inserted in parallel, multiple comrades can practice communication together in one place. You might as well give it a try.</p>
<h3>Introducing a Special Two-Tube Shortwave Radio</h3>
<p>— Ke Qin</p>
<p>Recently, many different styles of radio vacuum tubes have been introduced. If amateurs still use old-fashioned vacuum tubes to build radios, the performance will inevitably be poor. There are many styles of new vacuum tubes, and the 6D6 and 76 types are quite popular because they can make the volume louder and the reception more stable. The one I am introducing now is a two-tube shortwave radio using these two types of vacuum tubes.</p>
<p>The circuit diagram of this machine is attached. The 6D6 vacuum tube is used for detection, and the 76 vacuum tube is used for audio frequency amplification. The detection also uses a band-spreading device. The volume is controlled by a 50,000-ohm carbon resistor.</p>
<p>A small variable capacitor is added to the antenna circuit. Its capacity is 0.00005. C2 is the main parallel tuning capacitor, used to adjust various wavelengths.</p>
<p>The reception wavelength range of this machine is extremely wide, from 17 meters to 278 meters. It uses four plug-in coil tubes. The waveband and wire number are listed in the table below.</p>
<p>The parts used in this machine are listed as follows:</p>
<p>C1: 0.00014 Variable Capacitor</p>
<p>C2: 0.000035 Variable Capacitor</p>
<p>C3: 0.0005 Variable Capacitor</p>
<p>C4: 0.00025 Grid Fixed Capacitor</p>
<p>C5: 0.01 Fixed Capacitor, Withstand Voltage 200 Volts</p>
<p>C6: 1 Fixed Capacitor, Withstand Voltage 200 Volts</p>
<p>C7: 5 Fixed Capacitor, Withstand Voltage 200 Volts</p>
<p>C8: 0.00015 Fixed Capacitor</p>
<p>R1: 1 to 5 Megohm Grid Leak</p>
<p>R2: 50,000 Ohm Resistor, for Volume Control</p>
<p>R3: 500,000 Ohm Resistor</p>
<p>R4: 10,000 Ohm Resistor</p>
<p>R5: 100,000 Ohm Resistor</p>
<p>R.F.S.: High Impedance Coil, 2,000 Millihenries, S.W. Switch</p>
<p>Because this machine has two variable capacitors, C1 should be fixed first, and then C2 can be adjusted. First turn C2 to about 20 degrees, then turn C1 until you hear a sound. Then make fine adjustments with C2. Also, because this machine has four plug-in coils, C1 should be calibrated four times, and remember the degrees, so that the next time you use it, you can save the trouble of temporary fixing.</p>
<p>Waveband (meters) L1 (turns) L2 (turns)</p>
<p>17.4I 8.3 (No. 16 Enamel Wire) 7 turns per inch 3.8 (No. 32 Silk-covered Wire) Closely wound</p>
<p>93-75 17.7 (No. 20······) 12 turns per inch 5.8 (Same as above) Same as above</p>
<p>66·150 37·7 (No. 24······) 24 turns per inch 10.8 (Same as above) Same as above</p>
<p>135.270 31.7 (No. 28······) 44 turns per inch 16.8 (Same as above) Same as above</p>
<p>The diameter of the above four plug-in coil tubes is all 1.5 inches. The distance between L1 and L2 is 1/4 inch.</p>

<h3>"Extremely Civilized" Weapons and "Novelties"</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>It is said that Italy is a civilized country and Abyssinia is a barbaric country, and that is probably correct. We don't need to cite many things as proof; just look at their fight this time, and the weapons used by the two armies, and you can see the difference between civilization and barbarism. The Italian army used poison gas and dumdum bullets to attack the Abyssinian army, while the Abyssinian army used spears and shields to resist the Italian army. The former is a modern new weapon, and the latter is an ancient old weapon. The barbaric country of Abyssinia wants to use the old weapons of ancient times to deal with the modern new weapons of the civilized country of Italy, and the result of being massacred must be inevitable. Who would listen to your barbarism, Abyssinia, that in today's advanced tactics and developed weapons, you still take out spears and try to fight the enemy? You really deserve it!</p>
<p>However, we must say that it is also unfair to say that Italy is a civilized country and Abyssinia is a barbaric country. Take the use of poison gas and dumdum bullets, for example, weren't these two kinds of military supplies banned internationally long ago? But Italy, which is called a civilized country, this time violated the convention and used these two kinds of poisons to harm the Abyssinians. On the other hand, Abyssinia, which is regarded as a barbaric country, did not dare to use them. Here, the true face of the so-called civilized people is fully exposed—</p>
<p>However, although Abyssinia announced to the world the use of poison gas and dumdum bullets, Italy did not admit it. The Abyssinian embassy in England recently issued a statement to refute this, saying that the Italian army's use of this "extremely civilized" weapon has been proven by a member of the Abyssinian foreign medical team, and if the Italian army continues to use this weapon, Abyssinia can no longer prohibit soldiers from using the same weapon. In this way, if the Italian army uses this "extremely civilized" weapon to attack the Abyssinians in the future, Abyssinia will undoubtedly use the same weapon to resist the Italians. By then, the Italian army may also have to taste the taste of the "extremely civilized" weapon.</p>
<p>However, although Abyssinia can also use "extremely civilized" weapons, this is not enough to improve its degree of civilization. How do you say that? It is because the Abyssinians have never seen a movie since they were born. According to news from Tigre yesterday, the Italian army is now enriching its propaganda power with films, and will open a screening in Aduwa city today. This is the first time that the residents of the city have ever seen it since they were born. The content of the film is patriotic demonstrations in Italy and the land and air military exercises held in Bolzano city in nine days, in order to show the strength of Italy. At that time, all Italian generals and soldiers will visit the venue. During the screening, it will also be explained in Amharic. A large number of local natives will visit this "novelty."</p>
<p>It can be seen that Italy not only has "extremely civilized" weapons, but also has "novelties." Can you say that it is not more civilized than Abyssinia?</p>
<h3>Illness</h3>
<p>— Meng Hua</p>
<p>My younger brother was fired by the manager of his shop because the manager saw blood in his spit.</p>
<p>Naturally, this was a big blow to us. This fixed income of eighteen yuan per month was lost along with the manager's announcement. Originally, I relied mostly on my younger brother, but now I have to take on this burden of life, because I am older than him and my illness is lighter. Needless to say, there is no room for discussion, I have to quietly and reluctantly take over this burden.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to the stimulation of unemployment and the lack of security in life, my younger brother's insomnia, which had been cured, attacked him again. At night, when I heard him tossing and turning, and his low cough, I also opened my eyes and looked at the mosquito net, looking at everything in the room, until dawn. But my younger brother's cheeks were even redder and scarier, and his lips were dry and scorched.</p>
<p>So, we had to come to the countryside, and this refreshing and fresh air was a bit beneficial to us. The countryside is quiet, and our house is bathed in the middle of the fields. Every day, my younger brother's coughing sound, following the rhythmic ticking of the clock on the table, played a poignant and melancholy tune. At night, the autumn insects along the wall also flapped their wings and sang their elegy. This dying scream accompanied the low cough, relentlessly piercing my heart.</p>
<p>The house is close to the railroad, and dozens of trains pass by here every day. At first, it is faint, and then it comes with a ground-shaking force, and the walls shake as well. The sharp whistle and the roaring sound of the train make me roll or put down my pen every time, and listen quietly, inexplicably, and fascinatedly.</p>
<p>"Fourth brother, when I hear the train, I think of..." my younger brother said. I understand what he means. Although my younger brother is sick, his thoughts and desires are as usual, and even stronger. He is exactly the same as me. Listening to this earth-shattering sound, his heart has already flown far away.</p>
<p>In this situation, my mood is depressed and indignant. What is forcing us to do this? The burden of life, excessive labor, everything has eroded my younger brother's life, making some of his organs gradually rot and gradually destroy. It is going to take away his life, his happiness, and even his hope.</p>
<p>Tonight, under the dim light, I bravely picked up my pen and decided to write something. I thought that if I didn't have money to send him to the hospital for treatment, I should at least buy him a bottle of cod liver oil, because it is not okay for him to continue like this. But what can I write? His coughing sounds like a sharp knife, ruthlessly dragging my heart. I looked at the light sadly and indignantly, lost in thought.</p>
<p>"Fourth brother, take a break. Don't ruin your health either," my younger brother said suddenly.</p>
<p>I turned my head. The mosquito net on the bed was hanging up and down, sadly. I saw my younger brother looking at me very excitedly, his eyes like a torch, burning my heart. He put one hand on his chest and gasped. I hurriedly got up and poured him a glass of water. He sat up and said in a low voice, "I'm already sick. If you get sick too, we two won't be able to survive!"</p>
<p>"Don't worry, just take care of yourself. Don't think about anything that's not good. Your body doesn't allow you to think wildly. Look at how much worse your insomnia has become. Just think about their future, and you'll be happy. Don't think wildly!" I comforted him. I saw strings of clear tears dripping from the corners of his eyes. The autumn insects were calling sadly, and the wind in the field was playing a tragic tune, along with my younger brother's coughing sound.</p>
<p>I went back to my seat, opened the paper, and bravely picked up my pen again. "Life is forcing you to write. You have to think about the doctor and the cod liver oil!" I encouraged myself. So I tried my best to write.</p>
<p>I woke up in the middle of the night, and my younger brother was still not asleep. "Younger brother, are you still not asleep?" I asked him in surprise.</p>
<p>"No, I just woke up," he said. Obviously, this was a cover-up. He immediately turned over and pretended to snore.</p>
<p>"This can't go on," I thought. "Poverty is our shadow. It is something that follows us every step of the way. But we are not afraid of him at all, just like the many people in the world who have hope and will. But such a body, this fatal disease, has deprived us of everything. Even if winter passes, it will be spring, but can my younger brother's body survive this cruel winter? A nineteen-year-old youth</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>, he has such a great future, but the demons are forcing him, watching him about to die. How cruel this is!" So my eyes became a little moist again.</p>
<h3>Gloomy Days</h3>
<p>— Ji Xuan</p>
<p>"Plants born in the shade, if not transplanted by human hands, must spend their entire lives in that shade, those gloomy days; but fortunately, humans can seize the endlessly endowed natural tonic. Sunlight not only gives good results to the body, but also has a great impact on the spirit. Just looking up at the azure sky from a sickbed will make you feel very happy, so being in the entire sunlight is bound to get the supreme pleasure." — (Kojima Fujiki)</p>
<p>In days when life has lost its center, in endless sorrow and decadence, one's own fragile soul is almost being stirred by the destroying black hand, planning to follow it and hide in an unknown world, I saw those few words in a small booklet.</p>
<p>As if a high-voltage current passed through, the nerves were hit hard, and in a kind of unprepared fluster, I froze; I pondered these strange sentences.</p>
<p>Simple, plain, real and unadorned words, what a wonderful and incomprehensible revelation it gives to a soul living in gloomy days?</p>
<p>As if gaining some valuable emotions from here, a kind of gratitude gushed up like an ancient hot spring, and a kind of innate stubbornness lurking deep in the soul erupted like a volcano. At this time, I began to feel angry, and also felt ashamed.</p>
<p>"When a plant is transplanted in the shade, it can only spend its life of gloomy days there." In this era, perhaps countless souls, like myself, have been transplanted to the shade, and are living endless "gloomy days"? However, what is transplanted in the end is the "soul", a part of humanity, not a plant without mouth, eyes, hands and feet. Life is fierce, and that series of "gloomy days" is also terrible; however, think about it: it is a person, not a "plant" that can be transplanted at will; dominating life is human beings themselves, and it is not said that what dominates human beings is terrible life!</p>
<p>A kind of shame, a kind of anger, a kind of self-confidence and pride (it is "human pride"), rose vaguely like the warm moisture on the muddy ground in March. One's own family has been transplanted to a shady place where sunlight cannot be seen, and is living in "gloomy days": but, picking up a mirror to look at, youthful stubbornness is still indelibly engraved on the thin face. "Not a tender and ignorant plant, it should not be transplanted at will," that thought.</p>
<p>So, looking out of the dark and narrow room again: the sky is blue, the sea is vast, and the sun is still shining there on the other side of the mountain: isn't there still a place in the outside world that is bright and warm with sunlight? Isn't that...?</p>
<p>Thinking, the pressure given to me by the gloomy days in front of me seems to be much lighter. It no longer seems so heavy, firm, dark and suffocating to me: it no longer has the face of a dominating master and a demon king to me; I learned the trick of taking it lightly, I learned to use "anger and stubbornness with sparks cracking"!</p>
<p>Yes, not a small plant, but human beings! Isn't it said? "What humans are fortunate about is that they can use their own will to seize this natural health tonic—sunlight." Yes, that is human pride! Looking out at the blue sky from an unhealthy sickbed can already make people feel happy, and what if they can be in the boundless light seized by their own strength...?</p>
<p>Life, use your last bit of strength to transplant people into the shade! Gloomy days, you also use all your baseness!</p>
<p>People are not plants—people have their own happiness and endowment.</p>
<h3>Loneliness</h3>
<p>— Er He</p>
<p>Because it was Sunday, I woke up a little late in the morning. The tea house brought the soybean milk and said it was about to get cold, so I rubbed my sleepy eyes and got up quickly. I didn't have time to wash my face or brush my teeth, so I finished the soybean milk and soybean curd. I thought, you are the best tonic, much more effective than cod liver oil, etc. So I licked my lips with the tip of my tongue for a while, and felt that the taste was indeed strong.</p>
<p>When I came back from a walk, I saw that the sun had already shone through the top of the cypress tree in front of the door. I glanced at the desk and saw a pile of homework like a small mountain. I thought, I don't care about it. So I lay down in the reclining chair and didn't want to smoke, but felt silent and empty in my heart. I fantasized for a while, and my about-to-be-destroyed soul was stirring again. Ah, I feel lonely. This loneliness is even impossible to dispel. I know very well that I have a lot of work to do on the desk, and it is beneficial to people and myself to clean up these odds and ends on Sunday. Is the whip of Monday about to lash out? But I just lay silently in the reclining chair, not wanting to do anything. I just endured the unbearable loneliness, and my heart was bottomless empty.</p>
<p>I was too lazy to go to the office for the prescribed two hours of office work, and preferred to be in the lonely house,</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>Enduring the unbearable loneliness. Looking out from the front window, the lawn, although dyed by autumn, was still green, which made me feel more sorrowful about my old age. Sparrows often chirped on the ancient rafters of the Confucius Temple, but this not only failed to break the loneliness, but also increased the heaviness of loneliness. Sometimes, they jumped down on the grass as if they had fallen abstractly, and the sound of "ga" made me wake up and look over, thinking it was the sound of uninvited guests. Yes, at this time, I desperately hope that someone will come to talk, and I will treat him with a cigarette and a glass of plain water. I will tell him how lonely I feel, but just talking about loneliness, in loneliness, I can get rid of loneliness. But where are my friends? So I raised my head and looked at the white clouds in the sky. The white clouds must be floating over the Yangtze River, and the white clouds must be floating over the top of the big city? Then, it should have seen my friends. What are my friends doing in the pigeon-like houses? Maybe they are also looking at the white clouds in the sky? Thinking, the feeling of loneliness became stronger and stronger. So I couldn't help but smoke. In the curling smoke, I saw many ethereal dreams.... So I don't know where the chattering sparrows flew to, but the loneliness became heavier. So I thought of a foreign writer's "Affair in the Desert." A French sailor was captured by the Arabs, and fled at night, but lost his way and walked into a desert. Then he met a female leopard. In loneliness, he and the female leopard were like a pair of lovers. I do need any kind of creature, cat, leopard..., but even the chattering sparrows that just came don't know where they flew to. So I spit out smoke, let the thick, lingering smoke occupy this lonely room.</p>
<p>After lunch, I fell on the bed like a dying cold butterfly. When I woke up, I felt that the afternoon dream was also lonely. I saw that the sun had shone through the back window a lot. I was lying in the reclining chair, looking at the pile of homework on the table like a small mountain, but just silently. When it comes to the most lonely time, what can I do to get rid of it? I can't do any work. How can I get through the late and lonely time by sitting? Looking at the sunlight on the white wall in the house gradually lengthening, but how old that is, is the late autumn sun already old?</p>
<p>Outside the window, a gentle gust of wind occasionally blew and turned a few pages of the books on the table, but then closed by itself again. The sunlight on the wall always moves slowly. Looking, looking, I just think someone will knock on my door. Other than that, I just think that dusk will come a little faster, but what follows dusk is a long night...</p>

<h3>New Song Introduction</h3>
<p>"Family Ethics" Composed by Huang Zi, Lyrics by Zhong Shigen</p>
<p>Theme song of Lianhua film "Family Ethics" Composed by Huang Zi, Lyrics by Zhong Shigen Everyone has a father, why am I alone without one? Everyone has a mother, why am I alone without one? White clouds are leisurely, the river flows eastward. The little bird returns but has no nest; the child wants to return but has no boat. Where to find the source? Where to find the source? Don't say that the child is an abandoned lamb! Don't...say that the child has cried and broken his heart! The pain of the world. Is it just losing parents? Arise, orphan, wake up! Lost lamb, put away your painful groans; offer your innocent heart. Respect the elderly of others as you respect your own; love the young of others as you love your own. Put away your painful groans; offer your innocent heart. Serve and sacrifice. Serve and sacrifice. Selflessness and altruism know no bias. The vast river, the hazy white clouds solemnly exist in the universe forever. Great harmony and universal love, share the joys of family.</p>

Leading the 'Li Wen' and 'Li Qi' maids, she moves gracefully onto the boat like 'Xiangling.' 'Untying the rope,' she drifts on the lake, with 'Yuanyang' playing in the green waves. Recalling last year when 'Xueyan' flew into the reeds. Before long, willows 'Connect' and 'Welcome Spring' again. Sadly, the peaches on 'Little Paper' are not yet ripe, but one hears 'Ying'er's' cry from the treetops. The setting sun resembles 'Amber.' A gentle breeze 'Assaults People with Flowers.' The boat docks at 'Embroidery Orange' Temple to visit the 'Miaoyu' nun and discuss the past and present. Crossing the 'A Little Board' bridge and 'Rainbow Cloud' path, one hears a 'Quiet Bell' cleanse the heart. She knits and strikes the 'Precept Ring,' and 'Granny Liu' responds by opening the fight. Inviting her to sit in the 'Baoyu' Pavilion, she is presented with a cup of tea, 'Pine Branch' and 'Baking Tea.' Incense from the furnace 'Xiu Yan' and 'Hui Xiang.' The 'Dou Qin' zither on the table is silent. The distant landscape is like being 'In the Book,' and the little magpies return to their nests like 'Gathering Clouds.' After a brief chat, she returns home, and one sees the 'Musk Moon' shining upwards. With a 'Hulala' sound, the water 'Xiang Yun's'."</p>

<h3>Leftovers</h3>
<p>"In the current decline of the singing world, only Metropolis Society can maintain its purity." What Nelson calls purity, I don't know how to interpret it?</p>
<p>And saying that a singer who sings well and is not arrogant, then "only" Miss Jingyun, is a bit too much and has the flavor of yelling and cheering.</p>
<p>Praising also has to be done properly, otherwise, if you praise to the high heavens, the one being praised will also have a headache and goosebumps!</p>
<p>The broadcaster, Xu XX, published an article in the broadcasting magazine a month ago, saying that "Lingjin Society owes electricity bills," etc., but afterward, the president of the society indiscriminately said he wanted to "find me" to talk, and God knows what that means!</p>
<p>Bai Xue: Willing to cooperate with you, but I have to declare that I have a strange habit of internal strife. If Bai Xue is a strange thing like Cao Cao, then I will go to war with He!</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>Zeng Ren, who is usually most afraid of dancing, has also been seen frequently in dance halls recently, accompanied by Yuan Fengju from China Radio. This is also a strange thing! (Above miscellaneous)</p>
<p>The private broadcasting charity performance has been over for many days, and the accounts have not yet been made public, which is very worrying.</p>
<p>It is said that Mr. Yuan Fengju, the host of this Chinese event, spent a huge sum of 1,400 yuan on ticket sales, and even rushed to put on the play "Xiao He Chasing Han Xin" within a month. This gentleman has always been thorough in his work. When he took over Huaxing Radio, the three-day special program made him famous at sea, and when he took over China Radio, he also excelled with special programs. Therefore, the result of this charity event should be more colorful than the film industry's disaster relief! (Above Jin Lang)</p>
<p>Yesterday, I hired a car to Foyin Radio and played there for more than an hour. It happened to be the broadcasting program of the Era Opera Company. I met all of their members and got many pleasant conversations, for example: Miss Wang Qi: Can be purely said to be a girl who understands the fun of singing. She has a healthy physique and is indeed not comparable to those who rely on the power of cosmetics to seduce young masters. I asked her why she was broadcasting? She replied with a smile: Happy!</p>
<p>Lin Ying: If you see her occasionally, you will definitely think she is an adult, but in fact, she is still a very lively child! She told me that she was only replacing Ye Ying and Ye Hong, who had gone to Siam.</p>
<p>Zhu Shuya is their president. The look on his face when sorting out the music was really like he couldn't find the lottery ticket. But in the end, he was still urged by the friends in the band. Alas! He's already considered enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Ji Jianhun: Enthusiastically jumping like a little monkey. Thanks to his thorough arrangements, otherwise, the lady's temper would be really terrible. This is because he is the leader of the singing group.</p>
<p>Fang Lan: Only sixteen years old, her methods are as sophisticated as the songs she sings. She is a top student at an obstetrics school. The drama group is led by Liu Yawei, and the members include Yan Qun, Xu Jingya and her brother Jingsheng, Jin Jin, and Liang Dusheng.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu told me that the members also include Liu Liying, Cang Yinqiu, Wei Heling, and Gao Mangsheng. The people who perform the broadcast are often changed, with the purpose of gathering interest. Business is secondary. After broadcasting "Yang Guifei," they plan to adapt the film script "The Peach Blossom Fan," which will probably be realized before the end of the month.</p>
<p>This group, in addition to the veterans who have always had broadcasting experience, are friends who are very accomplished on the stage or in the movies. I hope that they will not only take the interest of gathering as a premise, but also take on the educational spirit under possible circumstances to increase the strength of social education. (A Li)</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Jingsheng, the former chief playwright of the Guanyin Drama Company, has now officially joined the Era Broadcasting Opera Company as a playwright. However, Mr. Xu's entry and exit from the radio station are closely monitored by his fiancée, Miss Fang Yun. (Secret Agent)</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Zhanda sent a letter to Qian Yujun, saying: "... But it is true that the wedding invitations of the Zhu family were sent on behalf of the Zhu family, and it was not a whim. It was Mr. Zhou Gongjun, the former leader of a certain troupe in our society, who discussed with the troupe to perform as guest performers, and it was true that the ladies of the troupe allowed it..." (Original letter), etc., is specially reprinted here, just to clarify.</p>
<p>Movie News</p>
<h3>Silver Jottings</h3>
<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>Zhang Xinzhu, the new talent of Diantong introduced by Yuan Muzhi, the "old customer," originally had a one-year contract with Diantong. Now it is said that the contract will be torn up halfway through because Diantong believes that Zhang Xinzhu's performance in "City Scenery" is not good, and Zhang Xinzhu's appearance on the screen was originally for "self-promotion," so after one movie was filmed, she was already satisfied and didn't want to continue.</p>
<p>Diantong will stage a play "Resurrection" once, which is now in full swing. It is said that the script is being adapted by Tang Na based on the original.</p>
<p>After the drama movement, it seems to have become a sideline trend for various film companies. The "Crescent Moon" of the stars has already been staged. The Yueming Company has the Oriental Theatre Company led by Wan Laitian and Jinshan, and Tianyi and Yihua have recently been rumored to have theatre company organizations as well. The only one missing is the Lianhua Company.</p>
<p>It is said that Ouyang Yuqian, one of the three playwrights for the stars, has written a story and will send it to Beijing for preliminary review in the near future. As for the other two, Liu Na and others, there is still no news.</p>
<h3>About The Inspector General</h3>
<p>"The Inspector General" (i.e., the Imperial Envoy), directed by Sun Shiyi, Shen Xicen, Gao Laitian, Zhang Min, and Shi Dongshan, has been scheduled to be staged at the Jincheng Grand Theatre starting on the first of next month. With only one week left, the directing team yesterday issued an urgent notice, stipulating that rehearsals will be held every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday until the end of the show. The actors have no difficulty and are in good spirits.</p>
<p>Shi Chao, the protagonist of Liberty God, plays a principal in "The Inspector General," who is timid as a mouse.</p>
<p>Gu Menghu knowingly breaks the law. In "The Inspector General," as the director of the post office, he secretly opens the letters of the Imperial Envoy and exposes the secrets of the Imperial Envoy.</p>
<p>"The Inspector General" is dubbed by Lü Ji and lit by Yang Qiming. It is currently being studied in the hope that this performance will make a new contribution.</p>
<p>Miss Wang Ying and Miss Ye Luqian have recently been making a fuss out of jealousy. It is because the mother and daughter in "The Inspector General" are both in love with the "Imperial Envoy," which is not true. Zhao Dan can rest assured.</p>
<p>Jinshan has read the script of "The Inspector General" thoroughly.</p>
<p>Zheng Junli and Zuo Mingjin are suffering unspeakably, having to film and rush to rehearse "The Inspector General."</p>
<p>Lan Ping, who was the wealthy and noble Mrs. Helmer in "A Doll's House," is a carpenter's wife in "The Inspector General," who is destitute.</p>
<p>Gu Er and Wang Ying have been very close recently. It is because in "The Inspector General," one plays the county magistrate and the other plays the county magistrate's wife. Little Lulu sees it, I don't know what to think.</p>
<p>Movie News in 1935: Hu Die is about to become a new bride</p>
<h3>Yihua Shorts</h3>
<p>— Baimu</p>
<p>"Triumphant Song" has been filming the scene of the Dragon King's procession for days, with five or six hundred people participating in the performance. Someone said, "This scene is not much different from Cecil B. DeMille's 'The Crusades.'"</p>
<p>All the actors in "Wedding Night" have been assigned and are now rushing to make costumes. They will go to Nanjing to film outdoor scenes in the near future.</p>
<p>"Hero of the Hour" will be sent to Beijing for inspection, and the screening period is not far away.</p>
<p>Wu Weiyun's photography in "Triumphant Song" has yielded special gains.</p>
<p>Yihua Drama Company's "Death of a Famous Actor" has been rehearsed skillfully, and Ye Juanjuan has been diligently studying Mandarin recently.</p>
<p>Zhou Xuan and Yuan Meiyun are extremely friendly and look like sisters.</p>
<p>Sound engineer Gu Zongyi recently invented a more sophisticated tape recorder.</p>
<p>In the past few days, Yihua Company has received repeated inquiries from the outside world about the screening date of "Hero of the Hour," which shows that "Hero of the Hour" is attracting attention.</p>
<p>Bu Wancang has full confidence in "Triumphant Song."</p>
<p>"Triumphant Song" will go to Qingjiangpu to film the opening dam scene after the interior scenes are finished.</p>
<h3>Yihua Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Baimu</p>
<p>"Triumphant Song" has a song called "Triumphant Song," which is extremely heroic.</p>
<p>In "Wedding Night," in addition to the main actors such as Yuan Meiyun, Wang Yin, Zhou Xuan, Qin Tong, and Ma Loufen, there is also a female lead who is planned to be invited by a certain big dance star to play the role. (The name is temporarily kept secret because it has not reached the mature stage.)</p>
<p>"Wedding Night" will focus on lighthearted performances, but it is not the kind of nonsense.</p>
<p>Hu Ping's return to Shanghai is not far away.</p>
<p>Yuan Meiyun was invited by the Suzhou Disaster Relief Committee to perform Peking Opera on the 24th.</p>
<p>Bu Wancang has been rushing to film "Triumphant Song" in addition to filming these days.</p>
<p>Yihua has a plan to produce cartoon shorts.</p>
