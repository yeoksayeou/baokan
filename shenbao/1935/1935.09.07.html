<h3>阿代表侃侃答辯　意代表悄然離席　以文明國自居耻與阿伍　國聯調解前途又呈惡兆</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯行政院今晚集議時、意代表聞阿代表之言論、懷懣塡腐、悄然離開會塲、意阿爭案和平解决之些微希望、至是乃轉惡化、會議本定今晚六時舉行、但延至七時十分始由中席紀那助宣布開會、意總代表阿洛錫卽向會衆宣稱、渠不願聞阿代表吉齊敎授之言論、故吉齊開始發言、阿洛錫卽引退、而由意外交部之羅加代之、吉齊於是滔滔發言、為阿　辯護、其言甚為激烈、方至中段、羅加卽起座離案羅氏出此、未動聲色、會衆在數分鐘後始發覺之、於是大起　擾、諸代表皆覺此事實為前途之惡兆、第羅加之離開會塲、當然不能作為意國將脫離國聯之解、</p>
<p>羅加引退後、卽密與主席通話、請令吉齊勿亂發言論、紀那助答稱、渠以為無理由可以止之、但蘇俄代表李維諾夫卽將發言、故願羅加回至會塲、羅加謂渠必須商諸總代表、並問可否將會議暫停片刻、紀答、渠不能出此、於是羅加乃轉達阿洛錫之意見、謂總代表須先査閱吉齊演說之全文、然後始能作决云、（五日路透電）</p>
<p>阿援引盟約十五條</p>
<p>吉齊演說中質問大利曷為欲便阿比西尼亞文明化乎、夫由安居樂業之人民中徵調十萬人、編成陸軍、以實行意大利之帝國企圖、此豈合理乎、阿比西尼亞對文明之理解、確然非造成靑年之警視、吉齊於是援引國聯盟約第十條、羅加卽在此時離開會塲、吉齊續謂、今第一步驟、應實施盟約第十五條、以圖解决雙方爭議、勿稍延緩、蓋再延緩、徒予意國以備戰之機會、而以已成之事實擊敗國聯、行政院已提出滿意的建議、意國若予接受、戰禍自可倖免、吉齊於是乃揭破意國重大之狡謀、謂其志在不尊重彼所欲破壞之一切云、（五日路透電）</p>
<p>意代表負氣離議塲</p>
<p>（日內瓦）今晚阿比西尼亞政府代表在行政院發表演說時、意大利代表離席而去、國聯會方面對於此舉、頗感不安、意大利代表此種態度、殆為必然之結果、蓋昨日阿洛錫在行政院發表演說、其中曾謂「意大利倘繼續在國聯會內、以平等資格與阿比西尼亞同席討論則不免深覺有辱文明國家之體面」云、又意大利代表聞吉齊敎授演說、有涉及法西斯政治之語、因而負氣不出席、則亦未可知、似此情形、倘不與意國以精神上之滿意、則意大利恐不願再行出席會議、若與意國以精神上之滿意、則行政院大多數代表以為與國聯會辨論自由之原則及會員國主權實相牴觸、恐亦難辦到、因此一般人深恐意國或將與日內瓦决裂、至少就意阿爭端一事、將與日內瓦决裂矣、今夜法國總理兼外長賴伐爾·復與波蘭外長柏克·西班牙代表瑪達里加·及意大利代表阿洛錫談話、法國代表團方面仍希望今夜所發生之事端、可獲得和平解决云、（五日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>旁聽席中感覺今日吉齊之演說、越過外交論調之範圍、而因是激怒意代表、大可不必云、今非俟意阿代表個人間之爭執調整後、則和緩之空氣、一時甚難恢復也、（五日路透電）、</p>
<p>（日內瓦）此間人士之意、意國或將反對法國律師吉齊敎授續充阿國總代表、意人各界謂昨晚國聯行政院會議中羅加離開會塲時、吉齊所發之言尤為不堪聽聞、若演說者為阿人、則情猶可恕、但縱為阿人、亦必較為和緩、此觀於駐巴黎阿使哈華利特出席上次行政院會議時所發之言論可徵也、吉口齊之言論、令人不堪忍受、意代表雖欲終席而退而勢有所不能云、（六日路透電）</p>
<p>李維諾夫仗義執言</p>
<p>繼吉齊發言者為蘇俄外交委員長李維諾夫、李氏官稱、過去十年間、蘇俄與意國之邦交甚為融洽、希望此項友誼繼續勿替、但本人不能贊助意國所建議國聯不問意阿爭端、意國並未否認攻擊阿國、此種攻擊事實上無異撕毀國聯盟約、並閒將來之惡例、所堪慶幸者、和平不可分裂之原則漸得人民之信仰矣、吾兄實難承認僅因一國內政之故、而遽動干戈、誠如意國備忘錄所稱、阿國之現狀無人對之表示同情、然亦未能遽因一國民族膚色之不同及文化之落後、而加以歧視也、各國均享獨立及維持領土完整之權、但除自衛外、實無用兵之藉口云、李氏最後提出凱洛格非戰公約、要求國聯不避艱險挽救戰禍云、此後未有繼起演說者（五日國民電）</p>
<p>主席阿根廷代表格那齊至是、乃表示希望下次會議、可提出解决意阿爭端之程序、行政院遂宣佈延會、時為晚間八點二十分、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>商妥組五國委員會</p>
<p>（日內瓦）關於組織特別委員會、依據盟約第十五條調査意阿爭端一事、現已發生新困難、意國因英法為有關係者、故反對其加入、而小國又不願擔負該委員所有之重大責任、西班牙士耳其與波蘭三國前曾有願加入委員會之說、今則聲明如英法因意國之反對而不加入、則彼等將重新考慮其前議、惟意國堅主如英法代表加入委員會則意國亦須加入、並稱、意國旣不反對國聯所派任何委員、亦不申請任何加入委員會、英代表艾登與法總理賴伐爾今日晨間會商後、國聯秘書長愛文諾及波蘭西班牙土耳其三國代表皆來晤談、雖閉室密談歷時頗久、但聞未有結果而散、意代表阿洛鍚旋訪問愛文諾、向之正式抗議阿代表吉齊敎授昨日所發之言論、但意方否認阿洛錫要求不認吉齊為明代表之說、聞古齊敎授　不願向意代表道歉、亦不願改變其論調、（六日路透電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）一今日疊開會議後、晚間始商妥以英法波蘭西班牙土耳其五國代表組織特別委員會、俾遵照國聯盟約第十五條處理意阿爭議、（六日路透電）</p>
<h3>行政院昨續開會議</h3>
<p>行政院將於今日午後五時再開會議、但在公開會議以前、將作一度非公開會議、雖意阿爭議問題未列入議程、但因賴伐爾與艾登之要求將議及之、惟將　請阿代表出席、尙未决定、（六日路透電）</p>
<h3>英法意　三國會外談判　前途殊難樂觀</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）英法意三國代表近頃在國聯會外談判、意代表建議於阿比西尼亞境內設置國際警察、常川駐在阿境、並聞英國對於意大利此種建議已予贊同、唯此種警察之編制、雖以意人為骨幹、但英法等國仍得參加、惟意大利要求將阿比西尼亞作全部之軍事佔領、名為「監督阿比西尼亞裁軍」、至於以阿國中部一帶之土地讓與意國、尙未表示滿意、現談判雖仍在進行、前途極難樂觀、（六日國民電）</p>
<h3>阿政府希望　國聯實行决議　全部爭議加以考慮</h3>
<p>阿京　阿王今日發出文吿、謂華爾華爾委員會調査之結果、已證明阿國不負衝突之責任、故八月四日所通過第二决議案中規定研究全部爭議之决議、須由國聯實行之、阿國為國聯會員、已根據此項决議申請國聯行政院考慮意阿條約之解釋、及其他爭執問題、（六日路透電）</p>

<h3>阿國秣馬厲兵　國王着手組織禁衛軍　志願兵十萬分任兩翼</h3>
<p>阿京　騾馬千餘匹現正飼草於首都郊外、阿皇現正着手組織禁衛軍、正須騾馬運輸營帳糧食、以及活動無綫電台、皇后所須之特別營帳亦已備妥、以皇后及其他貴族婦女亦須隨阿皇出發、蓋往昔梅尼立克大敗意軍於阿都華、已有此種先例也、阿皇禁衛軍大約四萬人、皆歐洲軍官所訓練、大主敎與政府人員亦皆將隨皇出發、此外更以精練之志願兵十萬、作阿皇禁衛軍之兩冀、及後方衛護、雨季未了時、若與意軍發生戰事、則暫用騾馬、待土地乾燥、則當用運貨汽車五十輛、供阿皇禁衛軍之渾輸、現聞阿皇之御衛軍、將策應戰事最烈之方面云（六日國民電）</p>

<p>格堤根寬十二丈、頂寬三丈六尺、高一丈二尺、長二百餘丈、與民埝及大堤（卽金堤）交接、適如一直角三角形、黃河自董莊向東北斜流、民埝與河併行如弦邊、大堤亦自董莊東引如勾邊、七月十日黃水高漲、於午後二時許漫溢弦邊民埝、六時以後、依次衝破股邊大堤各口門、鄄城官民、星夜動員二三萬人、兩日夜將股邊格堤趕築完成、俾洪流未直冲鄄城城區、保住一塊約當全境十分之三之乾凈土、（城區在格堤東三十餘里、四周仍為大堤與民埝包圍、）現該縣縣長秦道堉、　警衛隊隊長王景漢·曁各紳首等、　均在格堤蓆棚辦公、　一以防護未决堤埝、　一以籌施善後辦法、　附近臨濮·什家·白衣·各集村未被冲去之災民、　尤多麕集於此、　見記者上岸、　有以「員長」見呼、　哀求隨便施濟者、　天氣熱甚、　購食西瓜、　恐為蠅汚、　棄其剖面、　旁立婦孺、　卽蜂擁爭食、　良不忍之、　擇其病者、　酌施藥物、　衆殆誤認施賑、遂團團圍住、警兵力為解檡、始脫圍而出、嗣訪晤縣長等、承堅留午餐、餚　豐美、問災區哪得如此時縣長在外對災民演講、據左右答、韓主席日昨蒞此、特備以招待、後災民包圍乞振、韓氏不勝煩擾、旋有事於董莊、遂不復反讌、今適相晤、故轉邀宴叙云云、席上雖蒙主人厚意、殷勤勸食、然哀鴻環顧於外、實難下嚥求飽也、</p>
<p>鄄城偏居魯省西陲、瀕黃河南岸、此次黃河突在縣境董莊東之臨濮集、連决口門六處寬達五百餘丈、現第一至第四口門、已完全淤為旱口、淤泥深達八尺、臨濮集原為一大鎮市、全鎮僅餘四大皆空之一孤廟、因建築高固、當未漂沒、今尚半埋所淤泥沙中、第五第六兩口門、冲刷合併為一、寬二百餘丈、合一里餘、黃水正由此滔滔流出、其害不知將伊胡底、正河地勢甚高、口門外地勢低斜、水性就下、故正河水僅餘二成、餘八成全由口門洩出、官堤以南、卽口門以外、自光緒元年、迄未被水、地面低於灘地一丈有奇、是以波濤滾流如注、深淵洪水、東奔直衝魯西十餘縣、到處一片汪洋、盡成澤國、鄄城西自董莊、東至武安、（分居鄆城縣境之一集）北自官堤、南至順城、湮沒地畝八千餘頃、人畜淹死者頗多、屍具中竟有全家十餘口、聯屬一繩者、或縛於牛頸、冀牛浮水帶出未果者、至於攀登樹顛、蹲立屋頂、水災處所雇船隻、因係逆流、須兩三日後始得救、年事較高者、多已奄奄一息矣、總計全縣災民二十萬人、淹死二千餘人、財產捐失一千八百四十餘萬元、而土地十分之八九、全為沙淤、捐失尤無法估計、該縣災民收容所、計設縣城·信義集·榖林寺·等九處、共收容合格災民三萬餘人、以家庭同居為原則、就指定地域、由災民自備蓆棚或草庵、作為住所、其無任何器具者、另酌予補助之、災民每人每月發給炊食費洋一元五角、由其自行炊食、所收壯年災民、須負修路守堤及一切公衆勞役之義務、此外尚分災民　兒童成人婦女三部、各施以　字及職業拔能上之適當教育、組織尚稱完善、</p>
<p>黃河自七月十日决口、迄今瞬將兩月、進行堵口、導淄歸河、當局雖屢有成議、但迄未準備實施、而滾滾黃水、傾瀉東南、流逝如彼、不我梢待、先禍魯西鄄城·濟寗·魚台·東平·汶上·金鄉·鄆城·菏澤·鉅野·嘉祥·等十餘縣、並將蜀山·昭陽·微山·各大湖灌滿、直下蘇北、既已泛濫豐·沛·銅·邳·四縣、近復沿中運而擴張災區、此刻卽令堵口斷源卽宣洩積水、已成問題、矧堵口須籌三百萬之鉅欵、運備石料、更須三四月之時期、已大有措手不及之情勢、若仍聽其源源而來、露天巨流、固不能限其專在魯西蘇北、竟作飽和狀態、則黃河改道入海、勢所難免、度其趨勢、頗有中運轉六塘河入海之可能、行見步步擴大之災區、誠不堪設想者矣、</p>
<p>成災原因、七月初上游連日大雨、河水流量驟增、下游河底、較去歲淤高在一公尺以上、水位又已超過往歲之記錄、在半公尺至一公尺之間、此為天時上之災因、至於人事上、黃河水利委員會出資一百五十萬元、以作各省大堤加高培厚之費、朱口至董莊一段、特撥欵十萬元、由山東河務局長張連甲負責、顧豫冀堤工、都已完成、而朱口至董莊一段、獨未竣工、遂至出險、民埝初漫、大堤繼潰、以及口門東五里王譚大堤出險、人民懇請搶救、張連甲均藉口水大溜急、工料兩缺規避不前、王譚險工因城區人民、以有生命財產直接利害關係、自行以全力奮勇搶護、得以脫險、其他劃歸人民防護之民埝、皆無潰决之處、故各縣災民、頗不滿於張氏云、</p>

<p>明令公佈</p>
<p>敬啟者、査印花稅法”同法施行細則、業經政府於九月一日起施行、茲謹就管見所及、將其中可資商榷之點、列陳於後、査印花稅法第三條、列舉各種憑證免納印花稅、其第八欵規定、一凡公私機關或組織、其內部所用不生對外權利義務關係之單據」、是此項單據祇須機關或組織用於內部、不生對外關係者、均可免納印花稅、其於機關或組織、顯然認為整個體系、並無總分之別、更無總分互用之分、無論「就法文文字上、或精神上解釋、均屬毫無疑義、乃同法施行細則第四條後段、則贄以二至分機關與總機關、或分組織與總組織互用者、不得視為內部所用一等語竟將法律所明認之整個體系、而曲加解釋、强行分割、明為內部所用、不生對外權利義務之單據、而曰「不得認為內部所用」、非惟</p>
<p>顯背法意</p>
<p>抑且近於武斷、本會為火柴工業集團、其他公私機關或組織、雖未能盡悉其內容、但就火柴公司而言大抵因地域關係、設總事務所於交通繁盛之地以便集中管理、設分事務所及工廠於其他適宜地點、使其分司承轉曁製造之任、所有工作分配、及營業盈虧、悉由總事務所總攬中持、担負全責、良以公司為法人性質、其人格為法律所賦予、其權義與自然人相類似、故其總分事務所及工廠之分設、亦猶自然人首腦官肢之分形、表面雖有區分、實際原屬一體、不容斯須分離、更不容强為割裂、以是其總分事務所及工廠相互通知之單據、完全整個行為、而不能有分機關與總機關、或分組織與總組織之分、使其所發之憑證、及證券貼用印花、與同條第八欵之法理正同、該細則對於本法第三條第一函第四欵、則認為法人應有之規定、而未加以</p>
<p>若何解釋</p>
<p>對於第八欵則竟强以分機關與總機關、或分組織與總組織之解釋、謂其內部所用、不生對外權利義務之單據、不得視為內部所用、　　於法理、自亂其例、此細則應行斟酌修正　　　査印花稅法第十六條第四欵、規定各業工人、憑以支取工資之工賬簿摺、免課印花稅、同條第二十七欵規定雇工保單、亦予免貼、良以工人生計艱難、對於其所憑以支取工許之工賬簿摺、及保單等件、特予免稅、以示體恤、法良意美、至深欽佩、惟工人雇用契約一項、應否</p>
<p>免予貼花</p>
<p>法律雖未有明文規定、第按照上項免稅之例、似亦應在邀免之列、施行細則端宜深體法意、酌加解檡補充、乃徧讀細則條文、並未措意及此、似於體恤工人之法意、猶未貫澈、不無遺憾、此細則應行酌加補充者又一、竊思法律固應遵守、而研究不厭求詳、以上所陳兩點、似不無研究之餘地、貴會為商界領袖、而對於印花稅法、又復研究有素、用敢不揣讓陋、備函分別詳陳、尙祈俯賜提出研討、如蒙同意、並乞轉呈財政部、將上述細則與法意不符及缺略之處、酌加修正與補充、曷勝公感、此上上海市商會、中華全國火柴業同業聯合會謹啟、</p>

<h3>惜名勝於畏法</h3>
<p>勢利社會。最喜傳播人之惡名。譬如某甲偶吸鴉片。知者必為布告於眾口。某甲吸煙矣。已上癮矣。從此墮落矣。又如某乙雖真上癮，而每日祗吸三五分。傳者必張大其詞曰。某乙每日須吸數十元矣。家產蕩　矣。更有某丙因病吸煙。但晨起略吸少許。極有節制。能遵時到辦公處。對於公事，並無延誤。而傳者必謂其懶懈已極。百事俱廢。遇有人欲延聘某丙任要職者。眾必從旁破壞阻止曰。某丙終日僵臥。已成廢人。不堪任事矣。如某丙因此。發憤戒絕。更不復吸。而鄉里戚友聞之卽又黯然不言。更無一人肯為傳播某丙已經戒煙之消息者。噫。世道人心，澆薄如此。專喜揚人之過。沒人之善。幾若分所當然。吸煙同胞受其冤誣苦痛者，不知凡幾。夫人非至愚大惡。孰不愛惜名譽。故勸戒鴉片，宜就各人之名譽觀念，加以勸懲。有能戒者，輿論為之獎勵。並代洗刷已往之汚蔑。予以生計上之出路。其非萬不得已而不肯下決心戒絕者，社會帬眾共棄之。不齒上流。永無職業。則人皆楊然於吸煙之敗名，而猶幸戒絕之後，卽得恢復其聲譽。是不必經司法之科刑罰鍰，而已能激吸者以必戒。否有者並不知畏。若將吸煙者壓抑凌辱過甚。不知養其　恥。絕其恢復名譽之希望。則必使銜迫之以刑。不如勸之以名。</p>
<h3>吸煙者細胞變化現象</h3>
<p>— 唐家珍</p>
<p>觀於上圖，可見尋常人體各種細胞，俱極平善無過邀及不足之病，（圖一）吸食鴉片之後，其細胞均因刺激增加，此時思想神經完全感動而致共奮，（圖二）吸久成癮，細胞因刺激過量而致消失，非再有鴉片刺激不能振作，而細胞現象，遂致一片模糊，同時即有萎靡呵欠流涕等癥發生，（圖三）吸足之後，細胞重新回後，但有現象擬不自然，故各部細胞仍有過量不足之象，而致皆癥發生，（圖四）戒絕之後，經過蛋黃素之補充調養，即可與平常人一律無二，（圖五）</p>

<h3>鴉片源流考（續）</h3>
<p>— 劍農</p>
<p>鴉片輸入中國最盛時代。厥為滿清雍正七年。時英人運土從澳門進口者。月可三千箱左右。每箱盛土四十筒。每筒約重三斤有奇。每箱計重一百二十餘斤。　係番木板所製。並用生牛皮封裹。其土名目繁多。最上者為「公斑」。而另有一種名「小公斑」者。其　乃較「公斑」更勝一等。因之此種煙土。頓成為社會上等人物交際之必需品。此外尚有「白土」與「金花土」。則類似現在之用土漿。當時不甚受人歡迎。夫鴉片旣如此源源輸入。成為一種害人之嗜好品。歷時漸久。　毒漸顯。於是有禁販禁吸之舉。滿清政府第一次公佈禁止吸食鴉片之禁令曰。販者枷杖。再犯邊遠充軍。惟對於吸者。以託詞治病。不以犯罪論。故當時笑柄頗多。一般私販。往往強辯具所販者為藥材。非鴉片煙。因獲免罪　。為數甚眾。而最可笑者。莫如雍正七年。福建巡撫劉世明　稱。漳州府知府李國治　得行戶陳遠私販鴉片三十四斤。業經擬以軍罪。及臣提案親訊。則據陳遠供稱。鴉片原係藥材。與害人之鴉片煙並非同物。當傳藥商認騐。僉稱此係藥材。為治痢必需之品。並不能害人。惟加入煙草同熬。始成鴉片煙。李治國妄以鴉片為鴉片煙。殊屬乖謬。應照故人人罪例。具本題參。</p>
<p>鴉片私販之供稱「鴉片」原係藥材。與害人之鴉片煙並非同物。已屬可笑。乃福建巡撫劉世明身為封疆大吏。竟至被一私販強詞瞞過。公然以矛盾之語。上奏朝廷。而號稱英明天子者。亦後茫然莫明其妙。可見當時鴉片進口雖夥。吸食者究屬少數。其流毒遠不若現時之甚。故尚有人不知鴉片為何物。而致「鴉片與鴉片煙並非同物」之笑語發生也。</p>
<p>鴉片在滿清時。曾一再被禁。奈一般奸商。陽奉陰違。私販如故。於是乾隆年間。有第二次禁煙之舉。其禁令大槪。</p>
<p>國內商人販賣者枷一月。杖一百。遺邊充戍卒三年。侍衛官吏犯者罷職。枷二月。杖一百。流謫二千里為奴。</p>
<p>此令雖曾發生一度效力。然為期未久。流毒反更甚於前。乃於嘉慶初度。執政者下絕大決心。毅然嚴禁。並裁去鴉片稅則。當時尚有私販偷運之弊。故洋艘至粵。先由行商出具「所進黃埔貨船並無鴉片」之甘結。方準開艙騐貨。其行商容隱查出者。加等治罪。詎禁令愈嚴。而秘密販賣者愈多。流毒亦愈廣。英商設船屯積鴉片。有「鴉片夢」</p>
<p>停泊廣州灣之伶仃島。大嶼山一帶。私販包運鴉片之船。竟有裝置　械之快蟹（當時載土船名）包銷之商店。則在廣州之大窰口。并到處勾結衙門疋吏差役。以及巡防哨兵。故沿海各地官衛。多有私立契約。每輸入鴉片一箱。須納賄若干者。是可謂上海包銷煙土之大公司及保護上岸之官吏白　人之鼻祖。</p>
<h3>虞美人館雜記（續）</h3>
<p>— 鈍根</p>
<p>燕子窠</p>
<p>前清光緒中葉。鴉片盛行時。上海之煙館林立。俗稱之曰煙間。大率規模弘暢。裝潢富麗。洞房曲室。設備周詳。入其中者。坐臥談笑。招妓侑酒。無所不可。更有商販。爭挾珠玉錦繍。書畫古玩。圍繞求售。客則繼足仰臥。顧而樂之。不知戶外之昏曉也。泊乎民國。煙禁日嚴。貧簍之徒。冒險犯法。私賣燈吃者。類皆蝸居陋隘。支破極為牀。煙客蜷伏其中。　懷如乞丐。於是俗稱此類塲所曰，燕子窠。予初不知燕子窠之名稱何自而來。後以訪友至粵人家。聞友笑聲在樓上。登樓覔之不可得。仰首瞥見屋面後有自　一小閣。爬活梯而上。則其閣低不能容人立。乃蛇行而入。友方與一人席地狂吸鴉片。　其足踏於屋　。予不覺失聲歏詫。　機而悟。此真可謂燕子窠矣。夫燕窠屋樑。今吸煙之密室亦上貼於梁。而其低矮且與燕巢相等。其所以如此者。蓋欲使煙氣上騰。透屋頂而出。樓下之人不得聞也。友言粵地煙室多類此。然則上海之所謂燕子窠。徒襲其名而未合其法歟。呵呵。</p>
<p>孝女磨盒</p>
<p>某甲吸煙。常用一牛筋盒。日吸一次。每次盡一盒為度。其居宅分前後三進。吸煙之空在中進。而藏煙之臥室在後進。甲每令具幼女供奔走添貨之役。女持空盒赴後進取煙時。道經大井。必信手一揮使盒磨擦階石，　然一響，以為樂。盒口受磨而損。則盒身日漸矮縮。容煙之量日少。而甲不知也。如是者年餘。盒乃僅存其底。終至無煙可盛。而甲之　亦已隨之減盡。女之功偉矣。按此即戒煙諸方中之遞減法。其理與用藥而抽減其中抵　品，所謂「杯杯淡」者相通。誠能持之以恒。行之以漸木有不安全收效者。</p>
<h3>軍中煙布</h3>
<p>舊時軍隊吸煙者最多。以司法之權力，不能及也。聞江浙之戰，齊方所以失敗者。即因軍中缺乏白麵之故。（白麵者，嗎啡一類之隱名也。軍中視之，較米糧為重。一旦忽然斷絕，全軍如死。不能動彈。）又著名驍將臧致平，楊化昭。其部下士兵，各於腰間掛一短竹槍，一夜壺燈。以備隨時停駐山凸野墓，即可臥地吸煙。仍恐作戰時間稍久，不暇臥吸也。則於出發之際，預發煙布。人各一條。懸之胸前。其形如薙髮匠磨刀所用。蓋曾浸於大鍋煙膏中，使飽吸，浸透，經風吹乾者。作戰時可啣之口中。吮咂數分鐘。便得過癮。精神頓長。而手中工作，絕無間斷。實彈發槍，蓋得命中云。</p>
<h3>徵求戒煙經騐與病狀報告</h3>
<p>閱讀本刋諸君。有曾經戒煙成功。或未得圓滿結果者。請將戒時經過。與平素發見之種種病狀詳細見告。俾得研究。為大眾解決困難。年齡，性別，體質，與通訊處，并希示知。以使奉答。家庭醫藥素發明者家庭醫藥社主任醫師唐家珍醫師敬啓。</p>
<h3>安慰吸煙諸君</h3>
<p>— 應化</p>
<p>不吸煙者，每鄙薄輕侮吸煙者。作為無決心。無志氣。懶惰畏葸。不肯戒煙。即或能暫時戒絕。終不復吸。可見其甘居下流。不圖上進。斯言也。吸煙者聞之。最為痛心。冤憤填膺而不敢辯。辯亦人不之信。於是常懷鬱恨，而吸煙者與禁煙者之感情，永遠不能融洽。亦煙政施行上一無形之障礙也。吾今先為吸煙者一伸冤枉。然後懇切勸戒。并予以調理萬全之靈藥。殆無有不心悅誠服，急於自拔者。</p>
<p>夫吸煙者所以難戒，　戒而復吸之苦衷。不外三　。敢為代述如左。一·同胞不幸陷入黑　者，其百分之九十九，為因病上　。惟病之自　不同。大　之　肝胃氣痛，肋　經痛，腹痛，筋骨痛，　　，痢疾，疝氣，遺精，失眠，　　，咳嗽，　喘，咯血，脹　，消化不良，　　虛　結痞等等。</p>
<p>夫鴉片本為止痛，止瀉，助消化，穢血行之最　　。虎列拉（即霍亂吐瀉）癥，尤所必需。匹　　為　醇費。亦常用之。惟恃此治　。易成　　。故歐美人士中嗎啡毒者亦甚多。（　　者，鴉片之精。西人不　用燈槍吸煙。但喜注射嗎啡。或竟吞食之。）一日不用。則諸病復發。大槪與中國人之脫　情形相同。呵欠，流涕，下淚，出汗，喉癢作咳，背　寒冷，四腳肩背抽筋抽筋　痛，小便不禁，甚至遺精，賢部感覺極難受之不適，血管中如有千萬蟲蟻鑽爬，胃中脹悶，不能進食，大便不由自主，有忽然湧瀉，全身臥糞穢中者，視聽官不靈，記憶力全失，其他各種舊病一時俱發，最普通之現象，則凡吸煙者，每當睡醒初起，體中煙力已退，輙呈懶惰頹唐之狀，四肢不能動彈，言語低緩艱難，而肝旺善怒，家人婢僕，輙受無辜之呵斥。此不吸煙人所當得目覩者也。誠思吸煙者一身陷於如是無量數種痛苦之中。其不能輕易戒絕。吾人不當加以矜諒耶。一·吸煙者大半因廢時失業而漸入困境。感受生活艱難之痛苦。又怵於政府之嚴刑竣法。豪劣　痞之敲剝脅勒。寗有不急思戒煙以脫大累者。獨奈戒煙之醫生難得。市上招搖者，不過投機騙錢，絕無相當之常識方術。又多年輕鹵蔴，施用速戒法，但圖治標，不能體貼被戒者之痛苦，而采用漸減法同時予以根本補救宿疾之治療。即或萬一幸遇穩健練達之醫師矣。又苦無安全恰當，絕無流弊，兼顧善後之妙樂。故雖一時斷　，而於是浮腫虛胖之象。身體內部，百病潛滋。速則三數月。遲則三五月。必發大病奇瘡。諸藥無效。惟稍吸鴉片。可以立止。此種現象。俗稱反癮。歐美專治麻醉劑中毒諸名家，亦公認之（外國名醫家學說甚多。容即譯出，陸續刋布。以供眾覽。）一·醫師戒煙取費，至少數十元，貧苦之人，一時焉能措此　欵，故寗茍安於印子錢式之吸煙，日費兩三角以延殘喘。自康樂素出，而以上難題，遂得豁然解決。因於鴉片諸同胞，不啻從萬死中遇救星。苦海中獲寶筏。蓋歷經試騐。誠為輔助戒煙之唯一妙品。和平滋補。絕無不良之副作用。取緩戒法。不受絲毫痛苦。尅日斷　後。仍予裨益氣血。增長精神。使身體日進於健全卻病之域。故永無反　。保無後患。況施戒之初。不須立刻斷煙。（指領照吸煙者言）得各自量其體力財力。酌定抽減鴉片之遲速。（有康樂素與奮精神。減煙時決無痛苦）何便如之。勉哉諸君。可以興矣。國家危亡。方待諸君共同挽救也。</p>

<h3>小男兒（卅）（八）</h3>
<p>— 美國奧爾珂德女士原著鄭曉滄（宗海）譯</p>
<p>韜廳聽了末一句話，大吃一驚，險些兒跌落河裏，狠命敎着窗沿，圓睜着眼向裏而看，彷彿像室內壁爐攔架上所放的那個剝製的貓頭為一般。當裴先生這麽說時，沒有人是　於違拗的。於是乃德拿了那根棍棒：看去驚駭而畏罪得彷彿正要去刺死他的老師一股，他在仲出的大手上輕輕打了兩記。然後他停住了，仰起頭來已滿眼是淚，看不淸楚，可是裴先生不動聲色地說　　再來，打得重些。</p>
<p>彷彿見到這是無可免的，而且急切要把這椿難事趕緊做了，乃德於是將他的袖子拖過他的眼睛，又急急打下兩記重板，手就立刻漲紅，然而這打板子的人更覺難過了。</p>
<p>「這還不够嗎」？他問道。可是氣也喘不過來了。</p>
<p>「裴先生只答道，沒要兩記」，乃德也就照做了，差不多不知道打在那裏，然後將那條板子狠命摔在房子那一頭，兩手抱作那個被打的手，以臉去偎它，並以充滿着愛敬，羞愧，輿悔恨的感情啜泣道：</p>
<p>「我會記得了！呀，我一定會了」！</p>
<p>裴先生然後以警箍住他，忽變他適才堅决的聲調而為富有同情的聲調，說道：</p>
<p>「我想你是會的。求上帝帮助你，並且要努力免行使我們再有這麽難堪的一塲』。</p>

<p>春秋</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （秋郎）</p>
<p>古人說：「春秋多佳日」，是的：像秋季里的「七夕」「中秋」「重陽」等等，不都是佳節良辰嗎？但這些祗有讓資產階級和有閒階級，及時去欣賞行樂，至於那些貧苦的人們，謀生活之不暇，焉有此閒情逸致！尤其是災區孑遺的災黎，他們雖在洪流滾滾中，九死一生的逃了性命，可是秋冬接踵而至，他們的「衣」「食」兩大要件無着，試問如何苟延下去？也許遲早將作餓莩凍鬼吧，思念及此，怎不令人心痛！</p>
<p>「秋風秋雨愁煞人」，這是鑑湖秋女俠遺留的名句，本來秋士多感，壯志未伸，何堪再遭風雨的侵凌，更驅入了愁雲慘霧的氛圍裏去，使他無處宣洩，祗得譜入詞句，供人咏嘆，言為心聲，情隨境異，世間如秋女俠輩，正不知恒河沙數哩！</p>
<h3>秋</h3>
<p>— 趙更媞</p>
<p>昔東坡妻，在梅花盛開，月色明朗的春夜，曾那樣說過：「春月勝於秋月，秋月令人慘悽，春月令人和悅。可召趙德麟輩來，飲此花下。」惹得東坡老，為了自已的妻，說了這麽詩樣的話，於是得意地寫出了：「輕風薄霧，都是少年行樂處，不似秋光，只與離人照斷腸。」這兒秋色的悽淸，與乎那種飄洒在人間的淡淡的哀愁，在他倆風雅的談吐中，一槪給抹煞了。</p>
<p>然而也有些孤芳自賞的人，在窮愁無聊的時候，還帶着輕蔑的笑容，對那些名利之徒，患得患失，來去怱忙的舉動，護嘲着什麼蝸角功名，曇花泡影。却來贊賞「入秋風物，件件是佳句。」大抵樂觀的人，都不願見這瘦削的秋容。而所謂閭巷之土，不必是懷德君子，只要對於世俗，有着落落不合的習性的，往往會有悲秋的綠法，而那些人，也只叫人担憂他們永恒的潦倒，不得超拔。</p>
<p>偶一抬頭，天空有飄忽的白雲，乘着晚霞，不經意地掠過，點綴着這精緻的住宅區的捂桐，已露了一兩點憔悴的黃斑。自己忽脫口低哦：「晚雲帶兩歸飛急，去作西窗一夜愁。」而一陣凉風，掀動了單薄的夏衣，隨着有蕭瑟的意味，襲上眉心。但立刻自己警惕，以一個與世浮沉的人，决不配效颦閭巷之士，吟甚麽「白藕作花風已秋。」而那種注定了的潦倒的命運，在這個世界裏，似乎也要不得。何况只要不曾耳聾眼瞎，也該識得些壓在自己這一族上的逐漸沒落的命運。不曾給大水冲去，不曾為了挨不住飢餓而自殺，在這樣天高氣爽的季節裏，乘黃昏未去，靜下來看一兩卷書，不論是莊周的放誕，老子的淸眞，那已是太幸運，太幸運的了！再說：自己旣負不起治國安民的重任，又不肯安靜地過些平凡的時日，却來彈白髮悲秋的老調，惹些無謂的閒愁，請問，那又有誰敢？</p>
<h3>迎秋</h3>
<p>— 闌刪</p>
<p>曾在連天的愁風慘雨之下，在窗前吹過來的熱白菜的叫賣聲中，飄忽斷續，扣人心絃，好像警吿着我似的：「喂！秋天又來了呢！」</p>
<p>身上微微打了個寒噤，雖然這是未寒天氣。</p>
<p>看窗外那兩株梧桐，以前是靑葱艷綠，如今已漸次枯黃，金風一動，便有幾片殘葉辭別故枝，委地隨風捲舞。</p>
<p>又從遠處的寂寞而古舊的屋脊上，看見了秋天的凄的面孔，好像有幾分蒼白，但却靜默深沉。</p>
<p>秋，從我心裏趕去了春天的愉悅之溫慰。也擊走了夏日的奔放之豪情，使人寂寞而多感，悲傷而愁嘆。</p>
<p>它是帶着了一副嚴厲的手段而來的，可沒有悲天憫人的情調，千草萬木，從此漸喪生機。就連我唯一的伴侶，窗外這兩樹梧桐，也不能例外，並被摧殘了。</p>
<p>然而在這樣肅殺的情形之下，我的心因此愈形沉靜了。在上一季裏所有的放肆的心情，不覺為之一歛。</p>
<p>在寂寞的秋夜中，靜站在臥室的窗前，手裏夾着烟捲，不停的吸着。凭欄遠望，縱目力之所及，偶見碧色的天外，時有幾隻秋雁南飛，這又何等樣的充滿了詩情畫意！</p>
<p>而秋天又最怕懷人，這很容易引起了無端的悵觸！想到當年的知心密友，如今遠隔天涯，不禁對秋風而與嘆。</p>
<p>試打疊起一片牢愁，按定了凄其之心舉目看淸朋的皎月，低唱着那支水調歌頭，亦自恐飄飄有遐舉之意，而此際秋風，又把你萬斛閒愁吹散了。</p>
<p>可眷懷的凄凉的秋日啊！你才是悲觀如我的人的老友！</p>
<h3>葉之落悲秋</h3>
<h3>秋之夜</h3>
<p>— 水冗</p>
<p>黃昏悄悄地爬上深深的簷頭，院子裏雁來紅的高貴的影子在薄慕的飛躍中淡下去。一支鳥鴉在窗外呀的叫了一聲，便掠着低屋項飛去，在遙遠的地方有烟囱吐着輕盈的靑烟。</p>
<p>懷着一顆寂寞的心，我跑下破樓。讓門兒虛掩着，閒步出來，一陣秋聲迎着我。我打了個寒噤。</p>
<p>踱着，孤獨地；周圍沒有一個人，沒有一些人聲。月亮一個給耗子啃過的光餅似的，無聊地獃在天上；寥寥的星是貶着眼，銀河凄淸地橫在中央。是秋虫的和靑音塞着人間世的剩餘的空間。</p>
<p>路是長的，黑暗的伸長到什麽未知的處所。我在一家響着手工的紡車的田舍旁拐了灣。形成銳角的，流出一條淸溪。那像白紗，濾看月光，我能看淸它裏面奇蹟的小石。</p>
<p>對着靜默的溪流呆望了一會，我的心也給濾過一般的凄淸。陡的，我又向前踱了！這回步子不再是悠閒，我似乎有了目的。</p>
<p>找到我所愛的地方，我坐下了。那是在一個古舊的墳墓旁，一個無名的墳墓，這見野草和天鵝絨一樣柔軟，木槿透着香，風在那拖着很長的影子的古松上嘆息，蟋蟀唱着悲哀的悼歌。</p>
<p>我採了一些木槿作枕，把萋萋的草作褥子，我想在大自然的撫慰下在這見過一夜，只一夜也够了！</p>
<h3>秋閨詞</h3>
<p>— 紫蘭主人選</p>
<p>桂花天氣可憐宵，香滿雲屏暑盡消，一笑帳中先祝嘏，記儂生日是明朝。</p>
<p>同眠轉覺繡衾寬，那識秋深午夢寒，最是曉窗鴛枕畔，紅顋無計避郎看。</p>
<p>銀河一片掛秋城，為拜雙星傍月行，心學香燒無別祝，願郎比妾更長生。</p>
<p>蘭釭的的照銀屏，漏翦無聲玉杵停，一道紅闌凉似水，自開珠箔數秋星。</p>
<p>海棠艷上綠階除，一院秋深落木初，搶得井闌紅柿葉，自研香墨乞郎書。</p>
<p>綠槐影轉小闌干，八尺龍鬚玉簞寒，自把紅窗開一扇，放他明月枕邊看。</p>

<p>溪水裏浮滿黃色的柳葉，王小姐站在那塊天生的什麽「仙右」上，已不能被陸先生拍出一張有倒影的照片來，瀑布每天總是打那個山凹子裏往下衝，亦未免有些兒厭看它了，而且，述上幾天秋風秋雨，猿啼松聲，究竟有點悽苦之威，王小姐夜晚睡在消夏別墅的珠羅紗蚊帳裏，又悄悄地惦念起那襲秋季的舞裝，和那幾家皇宮般的舞廳來了。多麽的溫柔而　　呵！</p>
<p>於是，王小姐决定下山了，箱籠，行李，土產……統由陸先生異日親自押送到上海。臨走，王小姐給陸先生一個秋波似的眼風，表示感謝的意思。</p>
<p>「上海北站」，是特別快車靠月台的時候，戴紅色土耳其帽子的脚伕拼命似地往車上跳，「頭等客座」，王小姐是被一位戴「博士架」的中年男子扶下車來的，走出站，又被扶上一輛奶黃色流線型合於秋季的跑車。開到日陞樓，被紅色交通燈阻住了。戴「博士架」的男子取下嘴唇上的雪茄，笑一笑說：「你感覺上海的情形怎樣，沒陌生吧？」王小姐斜一斜眼：「上海究竟是上海！」伊望了望大公司玻璃上貼着的「秋季大减價」的紙招貼，抖着擱在左腿上的右腿。</p>
<p>打南京路朝西轉灣，靜安寺路兩邊的梧桐葉子亦顯得枯萎了，有幾片被吹落在灰白的路面上打滾，再被車輪一輾，便碎了。大飯店的窗慢換了顏色，從車窗裏飄進來一陣古巴咖啡的香味，王小姐縮一縮鼻子：一這幾天那一家的音樂好，今天晚上就去坐一回兒，那隻「新狐步」已輕生疏了呢。」</p>
<p>在綠色的燈光下，在醉人的芳香裏，在彈簧的地板上，飄動着一　銀色鍛嵌白亮鏡黑色鑲邊的秋季舞裝，老舞客說：「秋凉後，王小姐還是第一次出現。」舞塲經理說：「從，此這裏又要熱鬧了！」</p>
<h3>新秋舊感</h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>時間的輪迴是永永不息的在推動，那可愛又可恨的　夏巳情悄地逝去，而這多愁易感的淸秋却也　　地降　了。於是多年的舊創新痕，又復要在我那個破碎的心房里動起來，而同時那巳經許久止水般凝滯着的心湖，此時也不免又將波動了。</p>
<p>第一個使我從今以後，在人生途上永遠感到寂寞的是我那安　的幻滅，伊的幻滅奪去了我一顆活躍的心，擊碎了我美妙的夢，’，使我此後的生活跌入在沉重的灰色裏面，</p>
<p>記得去年也是一個秋天我曾欣欣然的踏上了歸途，作了一回重返故鄉的夢：那時安姊曾知道伊唯一的弟弟回家了，所以特地丟了一切家務，奔到江干來候我，等到見了我，伊是怎樣的喜歡，怎樣在興奮呵！我相信這種喜歡肯興奮在成人以后從來聯曾在伊心詆流露過，尤其那微微的一笑，這笑中所含的意義决非淺薄的人所分析得出的。伊知道我愛吃鮮菱，因此伊又送來了一担剛從蕩裏採來的鮮菱。</p>
<p>到了家里，我始終沒有什麽話可以說，所以在一個頗悠長的時間裏，我們始終還是沉默着，更沒有一句可以表達內心的話能够說，數載闊別，一旦見了面又覺得相對默然，那一綫純潔的熱情，反而得不到奔放的機會，祗有在這彼此靜默中傳達：他們的屬望我，期待我帶來一些光榮和成功；但我現在帶來的一些，是什麽呢？幾件不値錢的行李，和一個巳經不健實的身體，還有一顆老年人的心境，和靑年人蒼白色的臉！現在見了他們眞慚愧；然而同時更有說不出的感激，感激得使我止不住的熱淚從枯瘦的頰上掛下來，我想將我幾年中的別後情况吿訴他們，這幾年中我曾受了幾許委曲，我更也遭了多少冷遇。但，但我怎敢說，怎忍說呢！他們屬望我，他們期待我，我終於帶了那無涯的失望回來啊！我眞想哭了：我要像一個孩子受了委曲投在他慈母懷中痛哭一樣，來換得、伊慈和的安慰，撫摩一下那創傷的心靈，可是我怎忍來重傷伊脆弱的心呢！我還是忍住了熱淚，抑止了悲苦，來違心的作那强顏歡笑吧！</p>
<p>現在又是秋天了，我雖想回去，然而我怎忍再回去呢？這時安姊的墓上也許蓬草已長得幾尺長了；伊長眠地下，那里得知伊那飄零的弟弟在凄凉落漠的秋夜，在客地為伊憑吊……我且將一縷哀思謹獻伊的墓前！</p>

<h3>痧子</h3>
<p>— 俞伯符醫師</p>
<p>小兒出世。有兩大厄。一日天花。二曰痧子。然天花自發明種牛痘後。可以避免。而痧子則尙無防避之法。</p>
<p>痧子亦稱瘄子。又名麻疹。其危險程度。與年齡成反比例。卽年愈小。危險愈甚也。</p>
<p>痧子一症。其傳染力極强。病人之淚涕痰便。衣服器用。固無論矣。卽其週圍之空氣埃塵。甚至患者將愈時脫下之皮屑。由風吹散各處。亦能傳染。故如附近有痧子發現。切宜嚴密隔離。</p>
<p>患者切忌葷腥。卽嗅得亦使痧子不能暢達。故乳母亦宜素食。食物以粥湯牛乳雞卵等易消化者為宜。不可受寒。且忌風吹。如兼有咳嗽塘瀉其他症象。則變症百出。愈形危險。切宜延醫調治為要。</p>
<p>患遺精者</p>
<h3>斷慾固精相依並重論</h3>
<p>— 鄭惠民醫師</p>
<p>遺精一症。文士多於武夫夫。都會多於鄕間。故又有文士病與都會病之稱。患者或夜間有夢而洩。或無夢而遺。以可貴之精。養命之源。潺潺流出。戕生致病。故患者莫不驚恐危慄。强制斷慾。以求弗漏。然遺洩依然。果何故哉。</p>
<p>按遺精患者，皆緣輸精管鬆弛所致。精關不固。躍躍欲出。雖遠色斷慾。盡屬治標。必焉固其精關。始為治本之道。</p>
<p>固精之方。以德國性病專家希米脫博士秘方所製之「希米脫氏固精片」為效力最確實。藥性王道。固精鎖關。如應如響。余對於患遺精者。每多應用。其效果無不當夜立見。亦治療遺精捷徑也。</p>
<h3>白帶不姙之治療</h3>
<p>— 任國祥醫師</p>
<p>婦女白帶。原因不一。患者膣內分泌一種膿性分泌物。酸性極强。男子精虫入內。立卽被其撲滅。欲求姙娠嗣續。絕對無望。</p>
<p>然婦女為舊禮敎所束縛。如患白帶。每隱秘不敢延醫求治。引為羞澀。一方面旣危害本身健康幸福。一方面且姙娠無望。殊可憫焉。</p>
<p>故婦女白帶一症。以自療為便。自療白帶之「療帶靈」出世。洵婦女患者之莫大福星也。</p>
<p>「療帶靈」功能淸透膿性分泌物。且能扶助有益之膣桿菌之繁殖。故凡子宮炎，子宮頸管炎，淋菌性　炎，及外陰部濕潤糜爛等症候。用之無不立奏卓效。至余臨診時往往採用之。其結果咸非常滿意。至共施用之便利。藥性之完善。猶其餘事耳。</p>
<h3>月經種種</h3>
<p>— 趙志皐醫師</p>
<p>月經云者。女子自春機發動期起。至日終閉止期止。每隔二十八日。而起一次之子宮出血之謂也。</p>
<p>其色暗紅。有如靜脈血。共量平均約三兩弱。其性質除含有子宮及　分泌及子宮頸　之粘液及多數之Bacterien外。與人身之血液。絲毫無異。</p>
<p>月經之由來。係子宮內面之粘膜上皮。受卵巢中破裂刺戟之壓力而充血。充血不已。漸形剝脫。細血管又從而破裂。遂致出血。卽所謂月經是也。</p>
<p>月經期中。衛生最要。切忌房事。操勞。遊行。舞蹈。飽食。最宜安靜。其局部可用綿花或紗布製之月經帶。以吸收排泄之經血。不可過緊。過緊則成栓塞。而致經血不能流出。積貯膣內。而成腐敗性膣炎。吾國舊俗。女子經來。每以粗布糙紙騎用。汚穢惡劣。吸收力又薄弱。微菌又孔多。紙屑入　。往往釀起膣炎等症。誠不衛生之尤者。</p>
<h3>神經衰弱療治法</h3>
<p>— 周笑涵醫師</p>
<p>（症狀）頭痛，頭重，凡事悲觀，健忘，情調變化，失眠，神經過敏，脊背作痛，腰酸，多汗，手足不溫，心悸，冷感或烘熱感，週身少力，數脈，疲勞感，多尿，及早洩，精漏，遺精，纖萎，（後四種特稱謂性神經衰弱）。</p>
<p>（原因）營養不良，多用腦力少用體力，精神受激刺過度，房勞，手淫過度，內分泌障碍，慢性中毒，及病後衰弱。</p>
<p>（治法）內分泌製劑（卽生殖素）為主，燐鐵砒，士的年劑副之。</p>
<p>（攝生）停止用腦，練習體操，節慾，禁慾，水浴浸身，電氣按麼，多吃牛乳，鷄汁，雞卵，及葉綠色多之植物，戒姻酒，達觀，忘憂，息思，無嗔怒，無七情之衝動，多旅行山野間。</p>
<p>（注意）其兼患有後四種遺精等症狀者。宜先用希米脫氏「固精片」內服治療。然後再用「生殖素』收全功。</p>
<h3>發育不全</h3>
<p>— 俞伯符醫師</p>
<p>發育不全一症。患者甚多。因並無疼痛等險狀表現於外。故人多忽視乏。以大好有為之軀。任其日就委殆。不加培養。不亦大可慨乎。</p>
<p>發育不全一症。大都由於先天不足或後天失調而來。夫為人猶如栽花。士壞之乾瘠。雨露之欠缺。皆足使花卉之萎枯。必寫選取沃土。潤以雨水。始得欣欣向榮。而人身如缺乏營養。或臟器間內分泌不足。咸足使百體虧損。精神委頓。以此而希冀發育。不啻緣木求魚。祇見其日趨絕境而已。</p>
<p>晚近醫藥昌明。自「生殖各系」出世後。而內分泌製劑。遂大吿成功。服入人體。卽能充盈脊髓腦髓。營養四肢百骸。而使人身得充分之發育。精神煥發。體力强盛。壯健康强？百病遠避。人生之樂趣自來。幸福之佳境之躋。誠醫界之良助也。</p>
<p>最近余臨診時。常樂用「生殖素」以治發育不全及先天不足後天失調等症。共結果常能合余所期望。故特表而出之。</p>
<h3>遺精種種</h3>
<p>— 馬介眉醫師</p>
<p>遺精者。凡男子獨身。旣不能預知。而亦不能自制。其精液自洩者是也。</p>
<p>遺精有生理與病理二種。凡遺精頻頻。而引起種種不適及疾患者。皆屬諸病理。宜速求治。</p>
<p>遺精病原。由於房勞及手淫者為最多。其他若壯年無偶。　居過久。或病後體弱。或睡前過飽。亦足誘起。</p>
<p>遺精有夢而遺者。有無夢而洩者。延不醫治。則精管鬆弛。病根深重。其結果釀成神經衰弱而頹廢。</p>
<p>遺精一症。宜標本兼治。闕一不為功。服希米脫氏「固精片』以固其精管而直接北遺精。斯丹那氏「生殖素』以培其元陽而補其虧。一面並戒絕手淫。節制慾念。則本症未有不治者。</p>
<h3>胃痛靈之效力</h3>
<p>— 任國祥醫師</p>
<p>市上所出胃疾諸藥。日漸增加。然功效確實者。寥若晨星。余臨診時。對胃痛患者。喜用『胃痛靈』。因其名實相符也。茲一述余之臨診經騐。該劑主治範圍。如因多酸症發生之胃疾患。（卽胃擴張）胃下垂。胃弱。胃炎及吞酸停滯等症。均有卓效。其他暴飲暴食。攝取不消化物或腐敗物等所生之急性胃炎。胃神經痛。脊髓癆。胃阓瘍。或因飲酒吸姻過度而誘發之胃痛。亦皆顯奇功。且「胃痛靈』便於服用。在胃中毫無刺戟性。絕不抑制胃之分泌。對消化機能亦無障。誠所謂有百益而無一害。患者宜注意之。</p>

<h3>線圈問題的檢討</h3>
<p>— 明</p>
<p>——採用鐵心線圈——</p>
<p>一具完美收音機所必備的條件，需靈敏度强，選擇性說，對於高低不同音調的訊號放大力平衡，訊號與雜聲的比數差大，這許多條件，當然收音機任何一部份都足以使之受影響，而綫圈的設計，關係尤為切要。</p>
<p>現今最普遍的收音機，多為五管，其配合舉例如下：一——振盪與第一檢波混合級，常用6A7眞空管：一——中放級，用78或6D6管：一——第二檢波與自動昔址控制混合級，用75管：及一——成音週率輸出級，用41或42管。（如用2.5V類眞空管者亦相同。）此類收音機，因受眞空管數的限制，中放僅有一級，共放大力自需儘量提高，亦可使選擇性增優，此點如能滿意解决後，餘剩的問題，便是天綫級與報盪級綫圈的設計，怎樣可使收昔機成績改進。</p>
<p>設計振盪殺綫圈，因須顧及地位與經濟，所以多用小型疊繼式者，如能改用大直徑之單層綫圈，成績當然較優，但所改進的，僅能使靈敏度增强，其餘諸條伴的解决，又須賴於天綫綫圈。</p>
<p>現在收音機所繞製的天綫綫圈，體醴都極小，尤其有隔離罩的，影響效率减弱非淺，其唯一的補救法，都採用斜格疊繞法，以冀稍可减少損失。</p>
<p>綫圈的損失，足以限制其靈敏度與選擇性的改進，所以要設計一個合於理想的綫圈，必先分析線圈損失的原因，再謀免除方法。線圈損失的主因，可分下列三項：</p>
<p>一，絕緣層間的通感體損失</p>
<p>二，導線與隔離物的渦流損失</p>
<p>三，導線自身的電阻損失</p>
<p>（一）通感體損失的來源，由於導線間，難免有電容址存在，所以此電容量務使减至最小，如能採用適當的斜格交义繞法線圈，此項損失，可望减至最小程度，每圈交义次數愈多，損失愈小。長波收音機的線圈交义一次巳可，而廣播收音機因週率較高，通感體損失加大，每圈須交义四五次方能滿意。减少通感體損失的另一方法，可採用雙層絲包線，以增加絕綠層的厚度，而减少其電容量，當然卽可减少損失。</p>
<p>（二）導線渦流損失的减少方法，可採用多數細線絞合的絞合線，每根細線都有漆包絕緣。隔離物的渦流損失，亦可選擇電阻較低的物質，如銅，鋁，鋅等，並增遠其與線圈問的距離，以减少之。</p>
<p>（三）為了解决導體自身的電阻損失問題，不知費盡了多少無綫電工程師的腦血，一致認為减少電阻損失，唯有使規定誘導率的綫圈，，儘量改短其導體長度，而注意到綫團中的媒介質，必須選擇較空氣磁感更大的物質，以補償綫團誘導率的减弱，使仍能維持規定値。</p>
<p>許多工程師久欲以電力變壓器的構造，實施之於高週率綫圈，曾試騐各種鐵片，鐵屑，以及細鐵絲等作綫團鐵心，每次試騐雖都有相當成績改進，但對於極高的廣播週率電流，其鐵心間總難免引起極大的渦流損失，結果得不償失。</p>
<p>比較上以鐵屑最為滿意，但是必須分解至極小細粒，差不多在顯微鏡下方能辨別的細粒，而每個細粒，又須分別絕綠。這樣複雜困難的裝置，自僅能在大規模的實騐室內試騐，不能謀普遍商用。總之，鐵心綫圈的製造，現尙在胚胎時期，有待於未來的改進。</p>
<h3>製作交流收音機時的要訣</h3>
<p>— 周文德</p>
<p>直流收音機使用不便，而每月電池之費，亦需二元左右，所以一般業餘的同志們都喜製作交流收音機；如果交流收音機的製法簡易，聲音又優良，那就不用說了，但是製作時稍不得其法，則流弊百出；今將以經騐得來的幾件要訣寫述於後，以供同好：</p>
<p>（一）交流收音機製作時，所有零件，排列不合，影響極大，交流聲洪洪震耳，甚覺討厭，以經騐所得，惟於裝置之時，勿以螺釘或銲錫固定之，只以銅綫連之，試聽，如聲音不良，則可以他種方法排列，試聽之，至得最良之法，然後固定之；否則若先以螺釘，銲錫固定則試聽之後，覺得不好，又欲除去螺釘銲錫，甚覺不便。</p>
<p>（二）製作時須防金屬物之落入，否則容易發生短路，少則無聲，大則毀壞全機；切須謹愼。</p>
<p>（三）當我們製作不用變壓器之支流收音機時，（如用25Z5眞空管之代變壓器）尤需當心，容易觸電：最好以避電之木匣保藏之，以免危險。</p>
<p>（四）製作之零件，需一一察視，有否斷綫短路，或共他損壞一件破壞之物，有時足以殃及全機。</p>
<p>（五）製作交流收音機時，有時因導綫之破壞，變壓器之短路，而發生危險，所以最好在試聽之時，在導綫上加一開關及一保險絲，以防危險。</p>
<p>（六）製作時，先需知供給收音機電源，是否合於欲裝置之變壓器；如法租界之電源為110V公共租界之電源為220V如果以110V之電源用初級220V之變壓器；或以220V之電源用初級110V之變壓器，則有危險發生。</p>
<p>（七）交流收音機的接綫，表面須有絕縁者，偶生短路，則甚危險。</p>
<p>（八）在交流收音機中所用的固定電容器（FixedCondinser）大都皆用能耐高壓電流者，勿與直流收音機中所用的紙質固定電容器互相錯亂，致生危險：所以在製作之前最好詢問無綫電材料行，或有經騐者。</p>
<p>（九）交流收音機中所用的眞空管是有一定的，如30，31等眞空管為直流機上用的，不適用於交流收音機：而交流收音機之所用者，需為交流眞空管，或交直流眞空管；故不可弄錯。</p>
<h3>業餘雜談（續）</h3>
<p>— 吳英劍</p>
<p>去冬自製一交流四管收音機，自以為成績尙佳，使用好久，從未出過弊病，亦宋損壞過另件。但是有一次，調節音量的變量電阻，忽然失了效果，旋轉音量謂節的時候，不能漸漸的加大昔量，或减輕音量。不是大聲高叫，就是寂寂無聲。後來拆開一看，裏面的炭質已大半股落，用鉛筆細細的塗上，亦不能生效。這樣心裏總覺得不舒，必得覓出一個替代的方法纔安。有志者事竟成，結果得到了一個很好的音量調節法。原機在强力放大管的屏極上，接有音調調節器如圖，原來是串接一只，〇二MF固定電容器，與一只五萬歐姆變量電阻，現在將。〇二MF固定電容器，掉換一只一MF固定電容器，就成了一個很好的音量調節器。</p>
<h3>小阻率的固定炭質耗阻器</h3>
<p>— 泡</p>
<p>在配諧電路中的耗阻，普通固然是愈小愈好，但是有時因為要得到更平整的選擇性曲綫，所以特意接入一枚阻率小而沒有自感量的耗阻器。這種耗阻器，一向是用特別繞成無自感量式的綫繞耗阻器，因為事實上，市上沒有小阻率的固定炭質耗阻器，可供採用也。</p>
<p>最近美國Ohiohm廠，製成一套種類極多的固定炭質耗阻器，阻率小至〇·〇四歐姆，大至一萬萬歐姆（100Megohm）；電力自四份之一瓦特，至十瓦特；花色之多，足供一般應用，而一向有錢無處買的小阻率，固定炭質耗阻器，亦可買到了。</p>
<p>這耗阻器的外形，與普通的固定炭質耗阻器相同。製造時，曾在美國無綫電製造業聯合會（R.M.A）規定的標準下試騐，結果超出合格標準甚多。據說：雖在熱帶的兩季的惡劣氣候下，亦可照常使用。</p>

<h3>知識份子對出版界的責任</h3>
<p>— 曾建屏</p>
<p>近年以來，因為一般國民生活的窮困與過去幾次革命運動的失敗，使一時有過朝氣的出版界，很快地衰落下去。大的書店，好像資產階級，完全成為封建地主的俘虜，再也不敢　倡一點前進的革命意識：小的書店，却完全暴露了他們小有產者的面貌，回到趣味的陰影下去了。這種專實的具體的表現，就是某方面正在大印其古書，而某方面則在大出其富有肉戚的誘人讀物。目前出版界這種風尙，完全暴露者中國出版界智識份子—甚至全國民生活的自殺傾向。</p>
<p>這種傾向之發生及發展，似乎並不是最近一二年來的事。然而我們前進的知識份子—著作界與讀書界，却完全噤若寒蟬，一聲也不敢對這傾向予以有力的打擊：甚至許多歷來較為前進的作家，也不敢提出嚴正的批評。某些出版機關正有計劃地進行其復古，反時代，反革命的運動；而前進的讀者，却對這種反動的傾向及運動，採着自由主義的態度。自甘學習做駝鳥，把頭藏在一個看不危險的地方。如果說今日的出版界是「等於向民衆施送鴉片」（李麥麥先生語）：那麽，我們的知識份子，却無異是在默認殺害民族者的公賣紅丸。近年一般國民思想之腐化，一般國民生活之墮洛，我們前進的知識份子，是應該負起重大的責任的。</p>
<p>雖然一時代的風尙，其產生與發展，不免具有它的客觀條件。可是轉變風俗的勢力，實質上，也要依靠我們前進者的主觀七的抗爭。中國近年來政治上的苦悶以及經濟上的破產，固足以造成現代出版界讀書界之反動復古及浪漫　蕩的傾向：但這種傾向，是可以從廣大的有力的反抗運動而消减肅淸的。沒有人要讀古書，則出版古書的大書店，將要關門或掉轉方向；沒有人要看淫書漫畫，則發行淫書漫畫的小書局，必會倒閉而不能支持。讀書界的良好風氣的造成，最主要的是由於前進的知識份子的號召：而不是在於以營利為目的的大小出版機關的轉變。假如我們的知識份子，願意永遠學着駝鳥的辦法；那麽，革命的文化運動及革命的民族運動，又從何處談起呢！</p>
<p>所以中國目前的知識份子，如果不甘在文化的領域中實行慢性的自殺，那在這個時候，我們就應該起來：從批評上，造成廣泛的批判運動，來向目前的反動的復古運動進攻；從啟發上，造成有力的淸潔運動，來肅淸一切危害民族的頹廢傾向。積極地學習日本人及英國人尤其是俄國人，大最地出版文庫式的有系統的小叢書，小文庫。不單要從文學上去發展，而且同樣要從自然科學各部門和社會科學之理論部份各部間去發展。假不如是，革命的知識份子，只貪着一時的安全及閒適，那麼今日正在大出古書的出版界，其發展之結果，必將使我們的民族革命，文化革命過去的成就，完全掃淸，把時代又再拖了回去。</p>
<p>假如這個時代—經過去幾次文化革命及政治革命的時代，被目前的腐化的書賈及帶着馬鞭宣傳讀經的武人幕客拖回去：那麼，革命的知識份子，那時候除了再做幕客之外，在文化上將减輕了他—不，將消失了他的歷史的任務及推進時代的意義。故目前知識份子自己解放及自救的一條路，是不要投降復古運動的書賈及宣傳讀經的武人，堅决地起來督促目前的出版界，救救我們的子孫，救救革命及自己！</p>
<h3>談工具參考書</h3>
<p>— 陳豪楚</p>
<p>無論站在讀書人的立塲，或圖書館的立塲，我們都有很充分的理由希望出版界多多注意于工具參考書的編印。現在的敎學方式不是單令學生死讀一些敎科書，而是希望養成學生自動參考研究的能力：另一方面，一天到晚迫于衣食奔走的貧苦好學人士，他們不能有整天的閒暇去到圖書館裏翻閱各種圖書，也是很希望有工具書可以節省他們的精力，所以工具書的編印出版，蓋為今日讀書人士所一致期望着的，</p>
<p>參考書的範圍很廣，廣義的說，則凡各　圖書都有被參考的價値和使命；我們在此地冠以「工具」二字，就規定了他的狹小的範圍，即只限于作為工具而使用着的圖書。這一類參考書，就編纂的體例說，是以蒐羅各類事實，依法排比編纂，以便檢查爲目的的，從圖書館的立塲說，通常是另行放置一處，專供讀者檢查之用而不出借的。再從利用者方面說，在平時可以不必細細翻閱，而只在必要之時從事檢查以輔助讀書研究之進修的。依照這樣嚴格的意義，則所謂工具參考書者，便只有字典，辭典，百科全積，類書，年表，年鑑，索引等等。這一類書，即是我們希冀出版界多事注意出版的。</p>
<p>工具參考書的編　，在中國原己有很久的歷史。「爾雅」分部之法，「說文」部首之制，一直演進而至于「康熙字典」，字典蓋幾與中國文字同有其悠久的歷史。年表則漢初太史公著史記，巳利用周譜之旁行斜出法而有創製：萬斯同的「歷代史表」齊召南的「歷代帝王年表」，更為史學傑作。魏文帝時王象等一撰集經傳，隨類相從」，編成「皇覽」一書，則為開中國類書之源；其後各代盛行編纂，所成特多，明時凌迪知編有「萬姓統譜」一百四十卷，遠自上古，近迄明代，博綜系姓氏族，以韻為先後，以朝代為次序，並將歷代名人履貫事蹟，按時代分隸于各姓下，實為一部很好的中國人名大辭典；後來明淸時人之篇「尙友錄」，即仿該書的體例。索引在國內尙為新起的一種工具書，但淸汪輝祖編輯的「史姓韻編」六十四卷，為絕好的一部二十四史人名索引，雖在今日，查正史傳記者，尙為不可缺少的重要工具，然而工具參考書之編製，在中國過去雖見相當的發達，但能善加利用之者則實少，從前一般學者，多輕視工具書，以為人人能為而不足稱為著述。如汪輝祖所著史學工具之書，有「史姓韻編」，「九史同姓名錄」，「遼金元三史同名錄」等，不僅卷帙繁頤，且所作極為精審，但在有淸一代，實少有人注意，阮元為先生傳，但稱之曰「循吏汪君傳」：張之洞著書目答問，採先生書至五六種，而卷末淸朝著述家姓名略，竟遺先生之名，即此可見一斑了。工具書旣不為一般學者所重視，而用之者又不過為一些淺薄的應試舉子，結果工具書的褊製和利用，所以終于不能在中國學術界造成燦爛的風氣。（待續）</p>
<h3>北曲拾遺</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>商務印書館發行　盧前任訥序</p>
<p>據說這是天一閣所藏的明鈔本，共套數二十七，小令五十四。任訥序云：「景世珍，處味蔗，洗塵，湖西主人，他書皆無所見。……誤入天臺與虎頭牌兩套，與元曲選所載不同，足資參校。俏霄生斷酒色財氣一名，極類雜劇，又恰有四套，且官調各異，疑即一劇中之四套也。自來劇目中未見有此，尙待考。……廿七套中見於雍熙者七，茲巳略相校訂。」</p>
<p>這篇序是考證性質的，我且就他所說，拈出三點來談談：一，虎頭牌的校勘是否精密；二，酒色財氣是否雜劇名：三，見於雍熙樂府者是否僅有七套。</p>
<p>關於第一點，我們應該原諒任先生，因為他本來不過是「略」相校訂。但他對於曲牌的分合甚為注意，在這上面的疎忽似乎是不應該有的。例如，他指出北曲拾遺不應將山石榴與醉娘子合為一調，可為注重曲牌分合之證。但慢金盞原有六短句，北曲拾遺誤將後面的四短句別題為忽都白，任先生就不曾指出。又，不拜門的前一首也有題作相公愛的。醉娘子雍熙作醉也摩娑。根據北詞廣正譜說，二調其實不同。虎頭牌第二折校勘起來，可以得到好幾種不同的本子，如元曲選，雍熙樂府，北詞廣正譜，北曲拾遺等。最有趣的是聯套。北曲拾遺缺最後的離亭宴煞而多出前面的早鄉兒，其他各書則缺早鄉兒而多出離亭宴煞。照理應該二者都有的。茲以北詞廣正譜目次後所附聯套次序開列於後，並參校其他三書：（以元字代元曲選，雍字代雍熙樂府，北字代北曲拾逃）</p>
<p>五供養　落梅鳳　呈鄕詞（北作學鄕兒，元雍俱無）　阿納忽　慢金蓋（北分作慢金盛與忽都白）　石竹子　大拜門　山石橋（北同，元雍均分作山石榴與醉娘子小拜門（北同，元雍均分作相公愛與不拜門）　也不羅　小喜人心（元雍北均作喜人心）　醉娘子（北同，元雍均作醉也摩娑）　月兒灣　風人松（元荘北均作風流館，北詞廣正繕風流體第二格示例即為虎頭牌，目次中又稱作風入松，其前後自相矛盾也如此！）忽都白倘兀歹離亭宴帶歇指煞（北無，元俱作離亭實煞）</p>
<p>平時不曾十分注意這一折校勘閱讀以後，感到異國情調十分濃厚，新鮮的氣息撲人眉宇。例如澆奠不對天，而要「望着太陽澆奠，」這句子多麼的可愛！其他如竹箭，　線　襖，刺古笛兒，　皮鼓，甚至「銀盆也似龐兒着膩粉妝，墨錠也　鬚髯着絨繩兒纏，」也都別有一種風味。這是閒話，表過不提。</p>
<p>關於第二點，我的答案是否定的，這只要看這四套的語氣就可以知道，牠完全是由一個人在那兒詠嘆。在元曲裏，似乎還找不到京喝劇拾黃金那樣獨脚戯的例子。用酒色財氣作爲戯劇的，我們可以看到焦　劇說卷五所引的四大痴：「山水隣四大痴傳奇，酒痴爲姜應詔得不義之財，遂以酒敗家；色痴爲莊子扇墳，其妻劈棺事：財痴為臭盧員外一文錢事，氣痴為黃災以不第造反事。酒痴一名酒懂，爲武林李逢時撰。一文錢亦刻名家雜劇中，稱破慳道人作。當然這與俏書生斷酒色財氣完全不相干。財痴即一文錢，本身巳有六齣之多，見盛明雜劇初集，四大痴恐怕至少在二十齣以上，决不是四折可以容納的。北曲拾遺的編者似乎很喜歡酒色財氣的分咏，像鏡花緣的作者李汝珍那樣。他在同書裏又鈔下四首分咏酒色財氣的出隊子，（頁四三）又鈔下一合首詠酒色財氣的匯兒落帶過得勝令。（頁四七）</p>
<p>關於第三黑，我也感至任先生稍有疏忽。除他所舉出的正官端正好大打圍，商調集賢實述懷，村裏迓鼓，南呂一枝花贈英國，仙呂點絳唇景世珍作），甫呂一枝花間阻這七套以外，我們還可以舉出兩套來，即：，頁二十一，金殿喜重重見於雍熙樂府卷二頁三十七：二，頁二十八，南呂一枝花，見於雍熙樂府卷十頁十三。任先生所以不曾看出這兩套來，我想是有原因的，即：一，雍熙卷二，他只注意正宮端正好的總題目，不曾注意到共中還有一部分不是端正好，例如金殿喜重重，番馬舞西風，脫布衫，一剪梅，月照庭等：二，雍熙卷八，到卷十，這三本都是南呂一枝花為主，他只檢查首句完全相同的句子，看看沒有「一年老似一年」就算了，不知「今年老似去年」就是「一年老似一年」的異文，因此一眼滑過。</p>
<p>還有，任訥序稱皂旗兒用訓新奇，但此調第一首「坑暖窗明草舍低」在北詞廣正譜讀裏已經著錄，並非十分罕見的。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>我們的東方紐約</h3>
<p>— 家為</p>
<p>這也許是很值得我們驕傲快樂的吧，我們這個號稱為「東方紐約」的全國第一大都市——上海只是在欣欣向榮呢！雖然，十幾層以至二十幾的高樓大廈，要是與眞正紐約「摩天樓」，「聳天閣」相較，還差得很遠。然而，近年來，關於這種建築，正像「雨後春筍」，也是不可否認的。</p>
<p>據前日報載滬光社訊有「據公共租界及法租界工部局土木課傳示消息，近來兩租界建築統計，巨大建築投資激增頗驚人。自去年下半年迄今，公共租界內建築之大廈，共計為五千一百三十餘所。法租界因係住宅區，而此項新式大廈建築更形激增。故據建築界觀察，將來完成東方紐約，為期已不在遠。」</p>
<p>然而，事情却又不能怎樣樂觀的。據一位在某國貨公司里的朋友說，他們公司正籌備在　西某大商場里開一公分公司了。那西式花磚的大廈，是挺壯麗的。從一層到二層，地位佔了十幾間，却不需要付一些房金（照例每月需六百元左右呢）據說那位房主人因為怕「器具不用易於壞」——「戶樞不蠹，流水不腐」正是——所以願意這樣慷慨犧牲。同時，立有契約，期為六個月。待期滿後，公司得有贏於，這才開始繼着付房金呢。</p>
<p>在初，聽着這種事要使人覺得有些怪，然而事實却正是這樣—「不景氣」的氛圍彌漫到每一個角落，這是誰也不可否認的。就以公共，法兩租界投資於建築業方面的經濟數字來看：去年一九三四公共租界為三五，〇〇〇千元，法租界為一六，〇〇〇千元。若較之一九三〇年之六五，二八七千元（公共），一八，五八九千元（法），相差之大，就可明白了。而且，據公共租界工部局財務處的統計，單只公共租界內一隅的空房，去年夏季竟增到六千三百八十三幢之多了。（一九三〇年同期是四千六百八十七幢）要是連法租界與南市等地的空房都統計起來，那恐不下十萬數了吧——建築業投資與空房的增减，正成了反比例——然而，今年呢？</p>
<p>現在我們且節錄外埠某報載上海通信的一叚記述：「南京路一帶，為全市之中心。最近各商店十之八九，高揭廉價旗，大放盤標語，統計有百貨商店十八家，綢緞店十六家，鐘錶店七家，其他南貨店電料棉織皮貨等為數甚多。獨太保司徒廟（即虹廟）隔壁某香燭店，因年來提倡迷信者日衆，不特不必舉行廉價，且大有應接不暇之勢。三四年前，欲在南京路賃屋經商，頗非易事，非出相當運動費不可，今則招租之屋觸目皆是……都市之繁榮，漸趨冷落，誠不無滄桑之　也。」</p>
<p>所以，高樓大廈的巨大建物的激增，只不過是都市畸形發展的一種表現——地產業的失敗，使企業家們向着「佔天不佔地」的高樓大廈上去開發他們的財源了。</p>
<p>我們這「東方紐約」的繁榮——我欲何言呀？</p>
<h3>中秋月</h3>
<p>— 凌秄錫</p>
<p>（「月兒灣灣照九洲，幾家歡樂幾樂愁？」）</p>
<p>照例的，一到秋天，青空開始飄起赤金的，幻變的雲霞；天變得高爽起來，海變得空曠起來；枯萎無力的葉子，怨艾地飲泣着落到地上，在遲暮的哀愁中去記取那些過往的好日子；在遠處，一些不可捉摸的聲音隱約而糢糊地；　　地浮遊着　秋天已經無可挽回地滲來了。</p>
<p>居然是月亮圓的時候了，離開了都會的人是不容易像出大街上想的節景的；也許依舊是有一大堆電燈與人吧？（可是，聽說「中秋」對都會中的人也是有一點可怕的名詞，那也是一個關口呢），也許同樣地有着美麗的月亮吧……？</p>
<p>是的，是一個「佳節」了，月亮是圓而大而清澈的，她透過疏疏的樹枝，把青銅色的光撒在村舍的門前，撒在　個的「陸家宅」的小村子裏，像沒了油的燈</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>火一樣，陰沉地。</p>
<p>騰起來的怎樣的一種生之嘆息啊！那些人家——小小的村莊裏的五十來戶人家，在一陣總算是比較輕的水災後，在這淸寒如山泉水的月光下，隱約地想起了那些好年頭的輪廊：秋天，結果與收穫的季節，成熟了的發着香氣的稻頭，擺在眼前的一年勞作的酬報，中秋節晚上的可愛的月亮，民間的傳說故事，民間的風俗與節景，月餅，香斗，大堆的食物，孩子們的歡笑，大人的歡笑…</p>
<p>一大堆！好年頭的景像啊，可是這一切是已經過去，而且永不會再來的了</p>
<p>老年人嘆息着，一陣難受的饑餓冲上來，連想要咀咒的「一代不如一代」都沒有機會再去記起了：現在是，僅僅是一個被大水浸爛了一切作物，一切人畜，與無聲息的土地的村子，水退了以後，千辛萬苦地從比狗還不如的生活中死命的趕着回來（因為是：「就是死，也要死在家裏的！」）看，已經是：喪失了家，喪失了相識的人，喪失了活命的依據，村莊是僅僅成了一堆荒土，而人，也祇能緊緊地守在家鄉，而等待着夢一般的毀滅：死在家裏了。</p>
<p>依然記得的：是「中秋」了啊，而且又有那麽好的月亮，想起了往昔的日子，想起了失散與死亡的家人，想起了被同一個月亮所照着的另一個世界，淫樂與迷醉的享樂的世界，那些「幸福的人！」</p>
<p>（多少人飢餓，那樣地怨艾而憤怒啊。那樣的……！）</p>
<p>陸家莊上的人們，垂死的，於是，甚至厭惡這中秋夜的月亮了，在若難的面前扮起一種嬌艷，那簡直是一種惡意，無恥的賣弄，那是一種侮辱！</p>
<p>是那麽一個秋天的月的季候啊，人底心情是跟枯樹葉同樣地在愁苦與饑餓中枯死去了的。四野裏是那麽的死寂，在泥地在，在屋之四壁間，依然發出很重的濕氣，水的難聞的氣味，植物與泥土的腐爛的氣味。世界竟是那樣的沉鬱啊！葉子索紫地落下，許多不知名的蟲聲雜亂地響，然而，人底太息是無聲息的：那麽隱含，那麽沉着。</p>
<p>月亮，肥圓而覺滿的，照着都市過來的，顯得多傲慢啊！她是祇知道在美妙的笑臉中去找尋九洲的歡樂；而人世間有幾家愁苦，她是沒有勇氣去發掘的。</p>
<h3>老茶客</h3>
<p>— 胡慰難</p>
<p>三年前，我失業着，到處碰過璧後，我消極地每天上茶樓去挨過那亂麻一般悠長的日子。</p>
<p>那茶樓在一條狹小的弄子里，如果沒有鋪面的那家饅頭攤，或許你每天要找人問個訊；牠旣沒有××茶樓的招牌，亦不像旁的小茶館夜裏兼做書塲副業，有一條特請彈詞名家的紅字條可尋。至於我發現那家茶樓而在那里做了幾個月的老茶客，實在記不起那一次的偶然的綠遇了。</p>
<p>那茶樓上每天是這未寥寥的幾個茶客，各自佔着一只破籐椅把每個中午的太陽送到西山。他們都是上了年紀的，從他們的目光中可以看出受過各式各樣環境的磨礪，現在是像一條老牛一樣被人們遺棄在那角落里了。——那古墓彷彿的茶樓。他們都是默默地坐着，大家不想交談一句，恐怕那會打破那靜幽的安樂窩的空氣的。卽是幾個吟唔着繡像小冊的，聲音晉都壓得蚊蟲一般細小，把他殘餘的精力在其中找到一點樂趣。更有終日像入定的老僧，啣着旱烟袋，一袋接着一袋。所以我那樣一個年靑的小伙子初次踏上那茶樓的時候，引起了他們絕大的驚異，接連着好幾天，那些近乎利箭似的目光圍集在我身上。不過沒有繼續到十天，茶樓上又恢復到平時一般地平靜了，他們並沒有覺得增加了一個年靑的新茶客而發生什麽事故。我每天挾着自己喜歡讀的書報，埋下頭，喝着苦味的　茶，讓自家受一點莫須有的磨折。</p>
<p>有一個大雨天，茶樓上僅到了我及隔座的一位老茶客。那個缺了兩個門牙的茶博士來冲開水的時候，他嘆了口氣，「天眞是不照應窮人！」同時就在橫側坐了下來，他或許希望着由他這一句話而引起我們的話厘子。窗外是下着很大的雨，在灰暗的茶座中要是大家再默默地坐着，好像一種恐怖要襲來的樣子，這末着，那老者接口了：「年勢是一年不如一年啊！」</p>
<p>他搖着頭，磕去了烟袋里的餘燼，飄過一對經騐的目光，彷彿徵求我的意見。我心里是像堆棧一樣，成年有一大堆的牢騷想找個對手來傾吐為快的。不過在這樣的塲合中，我還是保持着我的態度，祇懂得他的意思似的交換了他的視綫。</p>
<p>「小世兄，你說是不？」</p>
<p>老者見我沒有答話，就逼緊一步問我。茶博士也仰起了頭，等候着我們的談話來打破死寂前沉悶。這樣我們天高地遠地談了起來，</p>
<p>那老者曾經單身闖過天南地北，他並不像一般的年老人，死抱着「從前」的什麽什麼，不過「現在」的一切是太使他失望了，他希望我們年靑人應該勇敢一點來負起這重大的職任的。</p>
<p>「但是我叩過多少希望之門，沒有一處地方能够容納我們這一大批抱有雄心的年靑人的！」</p>
<p>彷彿他卽是我希望中的一個對手，我在他而前吐露了胸中所簀壓着的牢騷。</p>
<p>「不過你們年靑人總是有希望的。他那樣地安慰了我。</p>
<p>之後，我們兩個是那茶樓中的例外一組，雖然年齡那樣懸殊，可是在每一件事的探討上我們的意見是一致地。我很慶幸在那樣狹小的環境中我得到了一位忘年之交的朋友。</p>
<p>自從找到了職業，忙於生活的鞭策，我是不能再上茶樓去會他，到現在是足足的三年。昨天偶然走過那茶樓，我很高興地上去想會一會他，可是他的坐位上已被別一個人佔據了，那些茶客也幾乎都是陌生面孔。問茶博士，他說那老者已死去半年多了！</p>
<p>在歸家的途上，我默唸着「你們年靑人總是有希望的，」幾乎又想拋棄現在的職業！</p>

<p>開篇「斷腸詞」</p>
<p>秋風寂寂落紛紜，杜鵑無語又黃昏，獨自推開窗前月，江中魚火照愁人，湖水悠悠心切切，孤舟岑寂逐江濱，萬種愁緒從心起，寬訴滿懷心愁韻，人寂靜，夜色昏，月光渾水白如銀，嫦娥似曉人失意，團圓偏照我鰥魚身，憶昔周卿情投合，花前月下早殷懃，她相愛，我相親，荷池憑欄戲對吟，曾記兩個共言及，海枯石爛心不離，實指望乘龍跨鳳巫山達，生生死死不離分，那曉得偏遇狂風平地起，吹息盟燭傾花證，而今是香消玉殞卿何往，可知我愁緒滿腹向誰云，今夜趨祭芳魂墓，卿卿可為我敘情，虧得我長年惟有淚痕眼，獨瘦我殘軀薄命身，是吳窮蒼情不恤，為什麼偏偏妒忌她寶釵裙，呌一聲天！天！天！你旣生人，何生恨，旣生恨，何生人，莫不是天公公有意將人侵，莫不是五百年債結今生，莫不是她嫌我癡情意薄，莫不是意戀黃坯自愛靜，但願我了卻塵世濁，隻影孤形來伴卿卿，今夜一哭何日見，黃土長埋姣軀身，廻腸幾轉寸寸斷，淚眼再望玉人墳，深深一拜情真訴，回首已見日東升，但聽杜鵑聲切吟。</p>

<p>有人說徐來是「好人」，起先我總不敢相信。最近在某報上看到她對人的談話，說：「我好像做了一個夢，捧我的把我捧上三十三天；撳我的把我撳入十八層地獄，但我却都糊裏糊塗，一些都沒覺得。」</p>
<p>於是，我纔相信徐來是「好人」之說不虛。</p>
<p>徐來雖說是「好人」，但是還不足稱爲「標準好人」，因爲她雖「糊裏糊塗，一些沒有覺得」，但是對於捧她上三十三天，和撳她入十八層地獄究竟是知道的。</p>
<p>如果說徐來是「好人」，那麼被稱爲「照片明星」的貂公斑華，也應該稱爲「好人」才對，至少，應該稱爲半個好人纔對。</p>
<p>「大家庭」獻映之日，因爲有明星們登台歌唱票子不到下午一點鐘，便賣了個空。</p>
<p>甚矣，明星之值錢也。</p>
<h3>閒話「大家庭」</h3>
<p>「大家庭」五號晚公映，六號卷已售罄，破今年電影市塲賣座之新紀錄。</p>
<p>「大家庭」中，牛鬼蛇神，千奇百怪，兄弟互相猜疑，妯娌彼此嫉妬，寫盡封建社會的百態。</p>
<p>當諸女明星登台時，觀衆喝彩如雷，啟唱時已雅雀無聲，歌唱節目有胡蝶之「夜來香」，徐來之「第記得」，葉秋心之「落花流水」，朱秋痕之「及時行樂」，顧蘭君之「下瓊樓」等。</p>

<p>「大家庭」結局，老大老一老三皆死于非命，一家堂前，共懸三個靈牌，凄慘之至，觀衆大流其同情淚。</p>

<h3>After the Bursting of the Pulao River East of Xuzhou, the Torrential Waters Flooded Two Districts; the Longhai Railway Foundation Was Surrounded by Water and Dazhuxu Station Became a Marsh; Lingbi County is Willing to Help 8,000 People Rebuild the Old Yellow River Embankment</h3>
<p>Xuzhou</p>
<p>The southern embankment of the Pulao River at Wafang Kouzhuang east of Xuzhou burst. On the 6th, the breach widened, and the waters became torrential, flooding fifteen villages in the Sixth and Ninth Districts. Many residents were unable to escape in time. Peng Xiaoqian, the section chief of the county government, urgently telegraphed the county government, requesting the urgent dispatch of fifty large boats to rescue the disaster victims. County Magistrate Wang Gongyu rushed to Dazhuxu Station on the afternoon of the 6th to investigate and sent twenty boats. The flood had surrounded the Longhai Railway foundation, and Dazhuxu Station had become a marsh. Farmers south of the railway blocked the Longhai culvert. The county government dispatched a team to clear it. Furthermore, Feng and Pei counties reported on the afternoon of the 6th that the water level of Weishan Lake had risen again by three centimeters and was flowing downwards continuously. Lingbi County feared that the Yellow River water would enter its old course and flood into northern Anhui, so they specially sent section chief Chen Jingru and Chu Xianting to Xuzhou, willing to help 8,000 laborers to rebuild the old Yellow River embankment. (Special dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>Xuzhou The water level of Weishan Lake continued to rise on the 6th. On the morning of the 6th, the Taoyuanji levee showed signs of danger, and the levee body was shaking. After County Magistrate Wang urgently added reinforcement and blocking, it turned safe at noon. The Wutun levee will also be completed soon, and it has blocked the head of the water. However, the breach in the southern embankment of the Pulao River between Wafang and Xia Zhuang is too wide, about thirty yards, making it difficult to block, resulting in major disasters in both the Sixth and Ninth Districts. (Special dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>Xuzhou Officials and civilians in northern Anhui are concerned about the Yellow River flowing into its old course. Lingbi County specially sent Chen Jingru, the construction section chief, Chu Xianting, the district chief, and Gao Huaqi to Xuzhou, carrying official documents to pay respects to Special Commissioner Shao and County Magistrate Wang, willing to help 8,000 laborers to repair the old Yellow River embankment. On the 6th, they went to Chedaokou, Pipa Mountain, and the Jing Mountain Bridge area to investigate. They will return to Lingbi in a few days. If the Tong District needs a large number of laborers, they will immediately submit a request to the Lingbi Special Commissioner's Office in northern Anhui, and northern Anhui will do its best to assist to prevent the Yellow River from flooding south. (Central News Agency telegram on the 6th)</p>
<p>Xuzhou The Longhai Railway's Bayiji and Canal stations are both submerged due to the overflowing banks of the Grand Canal and Pulao River. At the same time, the blocking of water flow by the Taizhao branch line has caused two-thirds of the Pizhou area to be affected by the disaster. The embankments of the two rivers are frequently bursting, and blocking them is overwhelming. According to reports, as the Yellow River water flows down continuously, Pizhou County will sink, and the people are exhausted from running for their lives and unable to defend themselves.

However, with the Yellow River overflowing, it is necessary to seek a solution urgently. Please consult with Li Yishe and Kong Xiangrong. Today, Kong consulted with the Blocking Mouth Association in Jinan, and the result was not to dig the people's levee in Juancheng, but to extend the Jiangsu dam and guide the flow to return to the correct river course.

Minister Kong's trip to Shandong has been fully discussed, and the method of repairing levees and releasing water is also under consideration. Zheng said that the blocking project of the Dongzhuang breach has begun to transport materials since the completion of the light railway. Once a considerable amount has been transported, it can be blocked at the opportune moment. Minister Kong's comprehensive blocking and prevention measures during this trip to Shandong have been fully discussed with Chairman Han. After further research, they will be gradually implemented.

<h3>The Japanese Side Proceeds with the Development of Inner Mongolia's Industries</h3>

<h3>The Legislative Yuan Held its Regular Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Nanjing Sun Ke, the president of the Legislative Yuan, returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 6th and went to the Legislative Yuan at 8:00 a.m. to preside over the 17th Yuan meeting. Sixty-six members attended, including Ma Yinchu. The following two items were discussed: (1) The Weihaiwei Management Office's general budget for local ordinary revenue and expenditure for the 23rd year was passed. (2) The outline of inspection for domestic sales of goods was resolved to be postponed. This case was to be reviewed by the Legal System and Economic Committees. The review concluded that with the current decline of all industries, improving domestic products depended on active promotion and incentives. If only passive inspection was carried out, it was feared that the purpose of improvement would not be achieved, and the people would be disturbed. Therefore, it was argued that the case should not be established and should be revoked. Yao Chuanfa stood up during the Yuan meeting to review the case and reported on the review process of the case by representatives from the Finance and Industry Departments, and then listed three reasons for revoking the case: (1) The inspection locations were unlimited, which could cause disturbances. (2) There were too many types of inspections, which would only restrict goods. (3) The inspection procedures were troublesome, which would easily cause people to feel pain. Then Di Ji made a speech, saying that industrial and commercial progress should adopt an interventionist approach. If the government did not inspect cotton for adulteration with water, rice for adulteration with powder, merchants and people would not only be accustomed to cheating, but also cause the advancement of their own goods. The inspection system can actually improve goods and raise prices, and it is not entirely a passive method. Moreover, the export commodity inspection outline passed by this Yuan in the past also used the inspection system to improve goods. Now that this case is revoked, is it not self-contradictory? He argued that the case should be postponed for the time being under the current economic downturn. Feng Yangguang, Yang Gongda, and others all agreed with Di's proposal. As a result, the proposal to revoke the case was changed to postponement. The meeting adjourned at 9:00 a.m. (Central News Agency telegram on the 6th)</p>

At 10:00 a.m. on the 6th, it convened the Finance, Industry, Foreign Affairs, and other departments to hold a meeting to discuss restriction and prevention measures.

<h3>A Word to the Members of the Economic Inspection Delegation to Japan</h3>
<p>—Year</p>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper carried a Central News Agency dispatch that more than a dozen leaders from all sectors of this city were invited by the Japanese side to form an economic inspection delegation, scheduled to depart on the 25th. Since the high tide of economic cooperation between China and Japan, this is a noteworthy event. As far as this reporter knows, since the end of the military confrontation between China and Japan, the activities of the Japanese in contacting and inviting cultural and economic figures from our country to go to Japan for inspection have lasted for many years, and now this economic inspection delegation has finally been realized. This is because, by today, the situation has developed to the point where the Chinese economic circles themselves also need to go to Japan for inspection in order to find ways to overcome the current economic difficulties. This is no longer just accepting an invitation. China has been mired in an unprecedented economic panic in recent years. In order to find a solution, it is necessary to examine the effective methods that various countries have implemented as a reference for formulating a self-rescue plan. The rationale is very clear and does not need detailed explanation. Japan has struggled hard in the world economic panic, and its achievements are seen by the world. There is a reason why it has been able to achieve this. Therefore, it is of great significance for leaders from all sectors to go to inspect and study it. Moreover, the liaison between the authorities of China and Japan on economic cooperation has reached a considerable degree. How the actual implementation will benefit or harm in the future requires sufficient preparation in advance. This trip to the East, on the one hand, is to observe the true intention of the Japanese economic circles regarding the so-called cooperation, and on the other hand, to make an earnest expression of the methods of cooperation that China can accept. This is also an important matter. Since this reporter believes that this trip to the East by leaders from all sectors cannot be compared to an ordinary inspection, I would like to briefly present my views below:</p>
<p>(1) Yesterday's newspaper only listed the names of the leaders from all sectors preparing to go to the East, but the details of the organization of the inspection delegation were missing. This reporter believes that if the inspection delegation wants to make the trip worthwhile, it is necessary to gather assistants with specialized knowledge and experience to accompany them. The inspection should be able to observe subtle details. The leaders' visits and interviews can only cover the general situation. The subtle points of good methods and beautiful intentions cannot be thoroughly understood without a small group of research and practical experience. In order to avoid the criticism of "seeing the flowers from horseback", it is necessary to pay attention to the careful selection of assistants. This concerns the internal organization of the inspection delegation.</p>
<p>(2) There are endless clues to economic inspection. Yesterday's newspaper stated that the nature of this inspection delegation is similar to the previous American economic inspection delegation to China. This reporter has something to say. The American inspection delegation's visit to China was only to understand the trend of China's economic difficulties and to produce a detailed report for the US government's reference for its policy towards China. If China needs to go to Japan for inspection, then what it requires should naturally be more than this. What are the most important points of Japan's economic development? What can be learned from Japan's economic policy to solve China's economic problems? How do Japanese capitalists plan to carry out the so-called economic cooperation between China and Japan? All of this requires a clear understanding in order to fulfill the mission of this inspection. There are still more than two weeks before the departure date, and the leaders have plenty of time to prepare an inspection plan.</p>
<p>Finally, what I want to say is that the trip to the East by leaders from all sectors has the relationship of connecting the economic circles of China and Japan. In this emotional connection, how to inform the Japanese economic circles that the patience of the Chinese people has reached its lowest limit, so as to help realistically adjust the relationship between China and Japan, is also something that needs to be planned in advance. This is another mission that should be had in addition to economic inspection.</p>
<h3>New Measures for Reorganizing Mineral Product Tax Newly Drafted by the Ministry of Finance</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) To reorganize mineral product tax, the Ministry of Finance newly drafted two measures: (1) Regarding the current collection of mineral products, except for Hubei, Jiangxi, and the coal mines of Dongzhong Xinglu Da, Henan Zhongfu Liuhegou, Anhui Datong Yufan, Zhejiang Changxing, which are managed by special commissioners, and Jiangsu and Hebei, which are temporarily handled concurrently by the unified tax authorities, the remaining provinces have not yet sent personnel to collect the tax. It is planned to first send personnel to prepare for the collection in provinces with abundant mineral products and higher tax revenue, and then extend it to other provinces. (2) In remote areas, due to special circumstances, it is indeed not possible to send personnel to collect taxes for the time being. The Mineral Product Tax Collection Regulations should be consulted, and it should be stipulated that when the mineral products of each province are transported to the provinces that have already started collecting mineral product tax, the first unified tax authority or customs should collect the supplementary tax on behalf of them, so that the national mineral products can be paid equally under the same tax system.

<p>(Nanjing) Shi Weihuan, convener of the Labor Law Committee of the Legislative Yuan, returned to Nanjing after completing his inspection of labor conditions in various regions. On the 6th, he told reporters that North China has a foundation in industry, but it is in danger, especially in the spinning, flour, and match factories. Only the carpet and sporting goods businesses are doing better. The reasons are: (1) dumping of foreign goods; (2) decline of the rural economy and weak purchasing power; (3) foreign businesses have better tax treatment than Chinese businesses, making it difficult to compete on price; (4) low production and sales in the industry itself; (5) high transportation costs; (6) increased wages but no increase in work efficiency; and (7) poor factory organization and ineffective management. In addition, the Factory Law is not being implemented in various factories. He will ask the relevant ministry to instruct factory inspectors to pay special attention.

<h3>Judicial Yuan Clarifies Penalties for Negligent Acts by Journalists</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Judicial Yuan has responded to the request from the Nanjing Journalists' Association to amend the Publication Law and the Criminal Law regarding penalties for negligent acts by journalists, seeking a clear interpretation to ensure their professional safety. The reply from the Judicial Yuan is as follows: Except for the amended Publication Law, which has not yet been promulgated, Article 310 of the Criminal Law regarding defamation does not have special provisions for punishing negligent acts. According to Article 12 of the same law, it only applies to intentional acts. As for the Judicial Yuan's Interpretation No. 303, the so-called "subsequent correction does not affect the establishment of the crime" also refers to intentional acts. The present request is based on a misunderstanding. (Central News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>

<h3>Abyssinian Representative Eloquently Defends: Italian Representative Quietly Leaves the Session; Ashamed to be Seated with Abyssinia; Future of League of Nations Mediation Looks Ominous Again</h3>
<p>(Geneva) When the League of Nations Administrative Council met tonight, the Italian representative, hearing the Abyssinian representative's remarks, quietly left the meeting place, filled with indignation. The slight hope for a peaceful resolution of the Italian-Abyssinian dispute has now turned for the worse. The meeting was originally scheduled to be held at 6:00 PM tonight, but it was delayed until 7:10 PM when the chairman, Ginazzo, announced the opening of the meeting. Italian Chief Representative Aloisi immediately declared to the audience that he did not want to hear the remarks of Abyssinian Representative Professor Jiji, so when Jiji began to speak, Aloisi withdrew, and Logatelli of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs took his place. Jiji then spoke eloquently, defending Abyssinia. His words were very intense. In the middle of his speech, Logatelli rose and left the case table. Luo left without making a sound. The audience did not notice it until a few minutes later, and then a great disturbance arose. The representatives all felt that this fact was an ominous sign for the future. However, Luo's departure from the meeting place cannot, of course, be interpreted as Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations.</p>
<p>After Logatelli withdrew, he spoke privately with the chairman, asking him to order Jiji not to make random remarks. Ginazzo replied that he thought there was no reason to stop him, but Soviet Representative Litvinov was about to speak, so he wanted Logatelli to return to the meeting place. Logatelli said that he had to consult the chief representative and asked if the meeting could be suspended for a moment. Ginazzo replied that he could not do this, so Logatelli conveyed Aloisi's opinion, saying that the chief representative must first read the full text of Jiji's speech before he could make a decision. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Abyssinia Invokes Article Fifteen of the Covenant</p>
<p>In his speech, Jiji questioned why Italy wanted to civilize Abyssinia. "Is it reasonable to conscript 100,000 people from a peaceful and happy people and form an army to realize Italy's imperial ambitions? Abyssinia's understanding of civilization is certainly not the creation of a police state for young people." Jiji then invoked Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant, at which time Logatelli left the meeting place. Jiji continued, "The first step now should be to implement Article 15 of the Covenant to resolve the dispute between the two sides. Do not delay any longer, because further delay will only give Italy the opportunity to prepare for war and defeat the League of Nations with accomplished facts. The Administrative Council has put forward satisfactory suggestions. If Italy accepts it, the disaster of war can be avoided." Jiji then exposed Italy's major conspiracy, saying that its ambition is to disregard everything it wants to destroy. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Italian Representative Leaves the Meeting in a Huff</p>
<p>(Geneva) When the representative of the Abyssinian government gave a speech in the Administrative Council tonight, the Italian representative left the meeting. The League of Nations is quite disturbed by this move. This attitude of the Italian representative is almost inevitable, because yesterday Aloisi said in his speech to the Administrative Council, "If Italy continues to sit at the same table with Abyssinia within the League of Nations with equal qualifications, it cannot help but feel deeply humiliated as a civilized country." It is also unknown whether the Italian representative left in a huff because he heard Professor Jiji's speech, which involved Fascist politics. In this situation, if Italy is not given spiritual satisfaction, Italy may not want to attend meetings again. If Italy is given spiritual satisfaction, most representatives of the Administrative Council believe that it contradicts the principle of freedom of debate in the League of Nations and the sovereignty of member states, which may be difficult to do. Therefore, people are generally deeply afraid that Italy may break with Geneva, or at least break with Geneva on the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. Tonight, French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval is again talking with Polish Foreign Minister Beck, Spanish Representative Madariaga, and Italian Representative Aloisi. The French delegation still hopes that the incident that occurred tonight can be resolved peacefully. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>From the audience's perspective, it was felt that today's speech by Jiji went beyond the scope of diplomatic rhetoric, and it was unnecessary to anger the Italian representative. Now, unless the personal disputes between the Italian and Abyssinian representatives are adjusted, the atmosphere of reconciliation will be difficult to restore for a while. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) It is the intention of people here that Italy may object to French lawyer Professor Jiji continuing to serve as Abyssinia's chief representative. Italian sources said that Logatelli's words in the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting last night were particularly unbearable to hear. If the speaker were an Abyssinian, the situation might be forgivable, but even if he were an Abyssinian, he would have to be more moderate. This can be seen from the remarks made by Abyssinian Ambassador to Paris Hawalit at the last Administrative Council meeting. Jiji's remarks are unbearable, and although the Italian representative wanted to leave to the end, he was unable to do so. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Litvinov Speaks Uprightly for Justice</p>
<p>Following Jiji, the speaker was Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov. Litvinov officially said that the relationship between the Soviet Union and Italy has been very harmonious in the past ten years, and he hopes that this friendship will continue. However, he cannot support Italy's proposal that the League of Nations not question the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. Italy has not denied attacking Abyssinia. This attack is tantamount to tearing up the League of Nations Covenant and creating a bad example for the future. Fortunately, the principle of peace is indivisible is gradually gaining the people's belief. He finds it difficult to acknowledge that violence can be resorted to simply because of the internal affairs of a country. As the Italian memorandum said, no one has expressed sympathy for the current situation in Abyssinia, but it cannot be discriminated against simply because of the different skin color and backward culture of a country. All countries enjoy the right to independence and to maintain territorial integrity, but there is no excuse for using force except for self-defense. Litvinov finally proposed the Kellogg-Briand Pact, asking the League of Nations to take risks to save the disaster of war. There were no subsequent speeches (National News dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>At this point, the chairman, Argentine Representative Guazú, expressed the hope that a procedure for resolving the Italian-Abyssinian dispute could be presented at the next meeting. The Administrative Council then announced the adjournment of the meeting, which was at 8:20 PM. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Agreement Reached to Form a Five-Nation Committee</p>
<p>(Geneva) New difficulties have now arisen regarding the organization of a special committee to investigate the Italian-Abyssinian dispute in accordance with Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant. Because Britain and France are related parties, Italy opposes their joining, and small countries are unwilling to bear the heavy responsibility of the committee. Spain, Turkey, and Poland had previously said they were willing to join the committee, but now they have stated that if Britain and France do not join because of Italy's opposition, they will reconsider their previous proposal. However, Italy firmly maintains that if British and French representatives join the committee, Italy must also join, and that Italy does not oppose any committee appointed by the League of Nations, nor does it apply to join any committee.

<h3>Ethiopia Prepares for War: King Organizes Imperial Guard; 100,000 Volunteers Divided into Two Wings</h3>
<p>Addis Ababa - Over a thousand mules and horses are currently grazing in the suburbs of the capital.

<h3>French Shooting Expert Appointed to Important Air Force Post</h3>
<p>(Paris) - During the European War, French Air Force officer Georges Guynemer, renowned for his marksmanship, was considered the strongest of the strong in the Air Force. After the European War, he turned to political life and was elected as a member of the Chamber of Deputies. Having been away from military service for eighteen years, he was suddenly summoned by Minister of Aviation General Victor Denain and given an important mission: to research and improve aerial shooting methods. During the European War, Guynemer would often fly his plane alone into German lines, shooting down multiple enemy aircraft with only a few bullets. He often shot down an airplane with only a few bullets, so he was invincible and often did not use much ammunition. Guynemer also had an exceptional skill, being able to shoot a five-franc silver coin (about the size of a Chinese silver dollar) at fifty meters with a pistol. General Denain summoned Guynemer because of his excellent shooting skills. Currently, there are two schools of thought in the air forces of various countries regarding the issue of shooting: one advocates the use of high-speed cannons, while the other favors the use of machine guns. These two schools of thought are also in dispute within the French Air Force. Guynemer will now serve as an arbiter. He will personally go to the shooting school in Cazaux and conduct experiments with the latest aircraft, which can reach speeds of over 400 kilometers per hour, and will study pilot training methods.

<p>Ottawa - The Canadian government today told the Japanese ambassador that Japan is collecting a 5% ad valorem surtax on Canadian goods shipped to Japan. If this special tax is not abolished, Canada will have no choice but to issue a notice declaring that the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty no longer applies to Canada. The Japanese government has repeatedly requested preferential treatment in trade between Japan and Canada. This will discriminate against various parts of the British Empire and foreign countries that have treaties with Canada that grant most-favored-nation status. The import of Japanese goods into Canada has already enjoyed significant benefits due to the reduction of exchange compensation tax, which the Japanese government has never acknowledged. The Canadian government now hopes that the Japanese government will understand the fairness of the Canadian government's position and abolish the discriminatory surtax imposed on Canadian goods. This letter is signed by Canadian Prime Minister Bennett. (Fifth Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Sir Otto Niemeyer Arrives in Japan to Discuss Mission to China; Focuses on Investigating Finances with Currency as the Center; Plans to Meet with Key Japanese Figures to Exchange Views</h3>

Sir Otto will meet with the Foreign Ministry and the head of the Ministry of Finance to inquire about the Japanese side's views on Anglo-Japanese cooperation and the possibility of investment in China.

He will also request understanding or cooperation between Britain and Japan regarding Japan's recent economic advances in China so that they do not infringe on Britain's vested interests in China.

<p>(Tokyo) - Sir Otto Niemeyer told reporters that his mission is to investigate China's current economic and financial problems and report his views to the British government.

Matsumoto, the commercial counselor of the Japanese Embassy in London, also arrived here on the Empress of Asia and told reporters that Anglo-Japanese commercial relations can be adjusted to satisfy both sides.

<h3>Liu Chongjie to Return Home; Far Eastern Association in Berlin Holds Farewell Banquet; Liu Emphasizes the Necessity of Sino-German Cooperation</h3>
<p>(Berlin) - Chinese Ambassador to Germany Liu Chongjie will soon leave here to return home. The Far Eastern Association held a farewell banquet for him today. Those invited to accompany him were all prominent figures. Ambassador Liu has many friends in Germany, so many people came to say goodbye to him today, which shows that Liu is deeply admired by the Germans. Dr. Lintner, Vice President of the Far Eastern Association, gave a speech at the banquet, saying that the ambassador is one of the few people who can understand the Germans in his country. The ambassador never neglected his mission. The ambassador has traveled all over Germany, thereby increasing understanding of the Germans and paying attention to the German political situation with sincerity and deep sympathy. He made tireless efforts to research and explore the construction work of the National Socialist government in the political, economic, and cultural fields. Those who wish for close Sino-German cooperation almost never had an empty evening at the ambassador's door. Germany has never had a pro-German advocate as active as you. You are the first. The ambassador's mission will soon come to an end, but his feelings for Germany will last forever. The ambassador will soon return home, but his two daughters and nephew will remain in Germany to study, which shows his sincerity towards Germany. When the ambassador leaves Germany, he will still remember the admiration of many friends.

He made so many close friends that it was almost difficult to fulfill his duties. After the banquet, most of the guests were reluctant to leave. (Fifth National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Berlin) - The German Far Eastern Association welcomed Chinese Ambassador to Germany Liu Chongjie. Liu stood up and gave a speech, expressing his gratitude for Germany's ability to recognize his work, but he still felt unsatisfied because his aspirations had not been fully realized. Since last year, the friendly relations between China and Germany, especially in the cultural and economic fields, have shown significant improvement. This gratifying phenomenon is mostly the result of the tireless efforts and sincere trust of Chinese friends in Germany, especially the power of the German Far Eastern Association. Liu continued, saying that since he came to Germany, he has always been deeply moved by the spirit shown by the German people in their hardships and difficulties, which has not only made him admire Germany, but also increased his personal courage. The Chinese people are also encountering unprecedented national difficulties in history, seeking national unity, national freedom, and equality. From this point of view, the two countries have a need for mutual assistance and cooperation. The possibility of China's development in the economic, cultural, and technological fields can be said to be infinitely great. He deeply believes that everyone and his successors will be able to continue to cooperate in these areas to achieve greater results. (Sixth National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Germany's Trade with China Shows Surplus; Chinese Egg Exports to Germany Increase Sharply This Year</h3>
<p>(Berlin) - Germany's trade with China in the first half of this year showed a surplus. From January to June this year, Germany's exports to China reached 47.7 million marks, an increase of 9.9 million marks compared to the first half of 1934. However, this is still 10 million marks less than the total value of Chinese goods imported into Germany. In the first half of this year, China's exports to Germany were 57 million marks, while in the first half of 1934, they were 64.4 million marks. According to economic observers, the reason for the increase in German exports to China is due to the purchase of a large batch of railway materials after the conclusion of the Chinese railway purchase contract. However, there has been a decreasing trend in other German goods exported to China. For example, in the first half of 1934, Germany's artificial silk exports to China were approximately 900,000 marks, while in the first half of this year, they were only 600,000 marks. In the first half of this year, the quantity of Chinese eggs imported into Germany increased. German stationery, automobile bicycle, paint, and perfume imports into China decreased significantly. However, Chinese-made coarse yarn exports to Germany increased threefold. Chinese sheepskin production also increased. Chinese wool imports into Germany doubled, while cotton increased fourfold.

<h3>US Continues to Purchase Silver to Reach the Ratio of Gold to Silver of 3:1</h3>
<p>(Washington) - Senator Thomas, leader of the silver faction in the Senate, stated today that when Congress reopens next January, the white silver, rural, and pension gold triple faction members will work together to seek currency inflation. Although he cannot predict the outcome, many members of both houses of Congress are currently dissatisfied with the results of the government's monetary policy and have decided to find a way to amend it. At the same time, Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr. also stated that the Treasury Department intends to give the Pittman Committee all the reference it should have. It is generally believed that the Treasury Department does not intend to disclose to the committee the details of the use of the 200 million yuan stabilization fund. The Treasury Secretary once said that, according to the law, the Treasury Department has no obligation to provide Congress with any information about the fund before next spring. According to the figures released by the Treasury Department today, the United States has purchased 500 million ounces of silver since the implementation of the Silver Purchase Act. The current silver holdings of the National Army have reached 1,159,000,000 ounces, valued at US$1,485,000,000. If it is to achieve the ratio of gold to silver of 3:1, it is still necessary to purchase 1.3 billion ounces. If the price of silver can reach $1.29 soon, it will not be necessary to purchase enough. Thomas said today that he is eager to see the report of the stabilization fund, but he feels that the Treasury Secretary has failed to prepare an explanation of the provision in the Silver Purchase Act that authorizes the government to issue silver certificates, so the Treasury Department's actions are not in line with the original intention of Congress. After the silver is purchased, it is not issued as currency at a price of $1.19 or the purchase price to make it circulate, so there will be action when Congress reopens.

<h3>A Record of Inspecting the Disaster Situation of Rivers and Canals: The Disaster Situation of the Dongzhuang Breach and Its Trends</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Geng</p>
<p>Going east from Huangzhuang for over ten li to Liuzhuang is the first dangerous section on the south bank of the Yellow River in Hebei Province. Baskets of bricks and straw are piled up like bunkers. The sound of the strong currents rushing against the dikes and dams is startling. The river workers in that section are working hard to protect it, and so far, there have been no accidents, which is admirable. Traveling northeast along the dike for over twenty li, we entered the territory of Heze County in Shandong Province. There were many disaster victims on the dike, each holding a stalk of sorghum. They had nothing else of value. Hunchbacked, they carried their children, as if they were fleeing to other places. When they saw strangers, or those in cars, they would cry out for help in unison. Those who sought refuge in straw shacks were even more likely to gather in groups and surround visitors, begging for relief. Women with bound feet and braided hair would reach out with the crowd, but immediately retreat shyly behind others. Their situation was very pitiful. Along the way, we repeatedly saw makeshift sedan chairs made of door panels and willow branches, carrying brides. There were no flags, drums, or dowries. Only a piece of red cloth was occasionally hung on the sedan chair. In this situation, the bride's family has already been scattered and displaced due to the disaster, so they are hastily sending her to her husband's family. The groom's family is also mostly living outdoors, unable to take care of themselves. They have no strength to welcome her, but they cannot refuse her either, so they have to reluctantly accept and complete the wedding. Although marriage is called a comedy, in the disaster area, both the bride's and groom's families see the bride as a burden. It is truly a reflection of tragedy.</p>
<p>This time, the Dongzhuang breach has caused six townships and four hundred villages in northern Heze to be completely submerged. The disaster is severe, far exceeding that of 1933 tenfold. The number of people who have drowned, starved to death, or died from epidemics is countless. Those who have not died are mostly temporarily taking refuge on rooftops, treetops, dikes, or hills, without support or food, living day to day. Although they have not died yet, they are already living next to death. The situation is tragic and urgent, and they are all eagerly awaiting rescue. Chen Yasan, the county magistrate of Heze, and Qin Jianbin, Peng Zhanyuan, Zhang Yingzhu, and others, have organized disaster relief centers, using old temples or building straw sheds. All disaster victims, regardless of county boundaries, are accepted. As of mid-August, a total of 25,560 disaster victims have been accommodated in 94 relief centers, managed by 16 branches. However, the disaster victims who have been accommodated only account for one-tenth or two-tenths of all the disaster victims in the county. In addition, there are 200,000 disaster victims who are struggling daily in the wind and rain. Although various charitable organizations have made some donations and the government has also allocated funds, the disaster area is very large and there are extremely many disaster victims, so the distribution is limited, and it is ultimately a drop in the bucket.</p>
<p>The river dike in Heze County is 40 li long and extends northeast into Juancheng County. Soon, it reaches Dongzhuang. The great embankment, the people's dike, and the Jiangsu dam are lined with mud houses and straw sheds, all temporary residences for disaster victims. The old houses on the plain south of the dike are close to the breach. Initially, they were flooded by the Yellow River. Then, because the breach opened in six places, the strong currents shifted eastward, and the old houses were silted up with mud and sand to a depth of five or six feet. Some only have their doors and windows half-exposed, while others only have the roofs visible. It is impossible to crawl in, and it is clear how cramped their living conditions are. Walking from the Jiangsu dam to the riverbank, the massive current is turbulent and extremely frightening. The river mud is swirled by the backflow, and a cracking sound is faintly heard. Then, huge chunks collapse into the river. This is the so-called "autumn river digging the bottom," which is extremely harmful. At that time, there was a sailboat about to cross to the opposite bank to observe the water flow of the breach and inquire about the disaster situation in Juancheng. So, we boarded the boat to cross. The river surface is about three li wide. Each crossing takes one hour. Initially, we rowed against the current along the bank, and it was still stable enough to sit. Then, we hoisted the sail and went with the current, and it became shaky and unstable. The strong current was rapid, like ten thousand horses galloping. The waves rose and fell very high. The boat moved up and down with the waves, sometimes rising on the crest, sometimes hidden in the trough. Looking at the willows on the bank, they appeared and disappeared. There were 18 passengers, mostly women and children with pale faces. The boatman told everyone to sit or lie down and not move. Hearing this, my heart jumped uneasily. After crossing the strong current, it was as stable as before. When we arrived at the newly built dam in Juancheng, the police asked and learned that the passengers were disaster victims, and then allowed us to dock and go ashore.</p>
<p>The base of the dam is 12 zhang wide, the top is 3.6 zhang wide, 1.2 zhang high, and over 200 zhang long. It intersects with the people's dike and the great embankment (i.e., the Jin embankment), forming a right-angled triangle. The Yellow River flows diagonally northeast from Dongzhuang, and the people's dike runs parallel to the river like a string. The great embankment also extends east from Dongzhuang like a hook. On July 10th, the Yellow River water rose sharply, overflowing the people's dike at the edge of the string around 2:00 PM. After 6:00 PM, it successively broke through the openings of the great embankment on the sides of the triangle. The officials and people of Juancheng mobilized 20,000 to 30,000 people day and night to rush to complete the dam on the sides of the triangle in two days and nights, so that the flood did not directly hit the urban area of Juancheng, preserving a piece of dry land that accounted for about one-third of the entire territory (the urban area is more than 30 li east of the dam, surrounded by the great embankment and the people's dike). Currently, Qin Daoyu, the county magistrate of the county, Wang Jinghan, the captain of the guard team, and various gentry leaders are all working in the straw sheds on the dam, one to protect the unbroken embankments and the other to plan for post-disaster relief. Many disaster victims from nearby Linpu, Shijia, Baiyi, and other villages that have not been washed away are gathered here. When they saw the reporter coming ashore, some called him "official" and begged for casual relief. The weather was very hot. When we bought watermelon, fearing contamination by flies, we discarded the cut surface. The women and children standing beside us immediately swarmed to eat it, which was unbearable. We selected the sick and administered some medicine. The crowd probably misunderstood that we were providing relief, so they surrounded us. The police worked hard to extricate us, and we were able to escape. Later, we visited the county magistrate and others, who insisted on having lunch with us. The dishes were rich and delicious. When we asked how the disaster area could have such food, someone answered that Chairman Han had come here yesterday and it was specially prepared to entertain him. Later, the disaster victims surrounded him begging for relief, and Chairman Han, unable to bear the disturbance, soon had something to do in Dongzhuang, so he did not return for the banquet. Now, we happened to meet, so we were invited to a banquet. Although we were treated with great kindness and urged to eat, it was difficult to swallow and eat our fill, surrounded by the wailing people outside.</p>
<p>Juancheng is located in the western border of Shandong Province, near the south bank of the Yellow River. This time, the Yellow River suddenly breached in six places at Linpu Village east of Dongzhuang in the county, with a width of over 500 zhang. Currently, the first to fourth breaches have been completely silted up as dry breaches, with silt reaching a depth of eight feet. Linpu Village was originally a large town. Only one lonely temple remains in the entire town, because the construction was high and solid, it was not washed away, and is now still half-buried in the silt. The fifth and sixth breaches have been washed together into one, with a width of over 200 zhang, or more than one li. The Yellow River is flowing out torrentially from here, and it is unknown what harm it will cause. The terrain of the main river is very high, and the terrain outside the breach is low and sloping. Water flows downhill, so only 20% of the water remains in the main river, and the remaining 80% flows out through the breach. South of the official dike, i.e., outside the breach, has not been flooded since the first year of Guangxu's reign. The ground is more than one zhang lower than the beach, so the waves are rolling and flowing like a waterfall. The deep floodwaters are rushing east to more than ten counties in western Shandong, turning everywhere into a vast ocean and a swamp. From Dongzhuang in the west of Juancheng to Wu'an in the east (a village in Yuncheng County), and from the official dike in the north to Shuncheng in the south, over 8,000 qing of land have been submerged, and many people and livestock have drowned. Among the corpses, there were even families of more than ten people tied together with ropes, or tied to the necks of cows, hoping that the cows would float them out of the water, but it was unsuccessful. As for those who climbed trees and squatted on rooftops, boats hired at the flood site had to take two or three days to rescue them because they were going against the current. Many of the elderly were already dying. In total, there are 200,000 disaster victims in the county, over 2,000 drowned, and property losses of over 1.84 million yuan, and 80% to 90% of the land has been silted up, so the losses are impossible to estimate. The county's disaster relief centers are located in nine places, including the county seat, Xinyi Village, and Gulin Temple, accommodating over 30,000 qualified disaster victims. The principle of family cohabitation is adopted. The disaster victims provide their own straw sheds as residences in designated areas. Those who do not have any utensils are given additional subsidies. Each disaster victim is given 1.5 yuan per month for cooking expenses, and they cook their own meals. The able-bodied disaster victims are required to undertake the obligation of repairing roads, guarding embankments, and all public labor services. In addition, disaster victims are divided into three departments: children, adults, and women, each given appropriate education in literacy and vocational skills. The organization is still relatively complete.</p>
<p>The Yellow River breached on July 10th, and almost two months have passed. Although the authorities have repeatedly made agreements to carry out the process of blocking the breach and diverting the Zi River back to the Yellow River, they have not been prepared to implement it. The rolling Yellow River water is pouring southeast, flowing away like that, and it will not wait for me. It has first brought disaster to more than ten counties in western Shandong, including Juancheng, Jining, Yutai, Dongping, Wenshang, Jinxiang, Yuncheng, Heze, Juye, and Jiaxiang, and has filled the major lakes of Shushan, Zhaoyang, and Weishan. It has gone straight to northern Jiangsu and has already flooded the four counties of Feng, Pei, Tong, and Pi. Recently, it has expanded the disaster area along the Central Canal. Even if the breach is blocked now and the source is cut off, it has already become a problem to drain the accumulated water. Moreover, blocking the breach requires a huge sum of 3 million yuan, and transporting and preparing stone materials requires a period of three or four months, which is already a situation of being caught off guard. If it is still allowed to continue flowing, the huge open-air flow cannot be limited to western Shandong and northern Jiangsu, and it will become saturated. Then, it is inevitable that the Yellow River will change its course and enter the sea. Judging from its trend, it is likely to enter the sea through the Central Canal and the Liutang River. The increasingly expanding disaster area is truly unimaginable.</p>
<p>The cause of the disaster is that heavy rain in the upper reaches in early July caused the river flow to increase sharply. The river bottom in the lower reaches is more than one meter higher than last year due to siltation, and the water level has exceeded the records of previous years by between half a meter and one meter. This is a natural disaster. As for the human causes, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission invested 1.5 million yuan for the cost of raising and thickening the great embankments in various provinces. A special appropriation of 100,000 yuan was made for the section from Zhukou to Dongzhuang, with Zhang Lianjia, the Director of the Shandong River Affairs Bureau, responsible for it. However, the dike works in Henan and Hebei have all been completed, but the section from Zhukou to Dongzhuang has not been completed, resulting in the accident. When the people's dike was initially overflowing and the great embankment subsequently collapsed, and when the Wang Tan great embankment five li east of the breach was in danger, the people pleaded for rescue, but Zhang Lianjia evaded and refused to go, citing the large water flow and lack of labor and materials. The Wang Tan dangerous work was protected from danger by the people of the urban area, who had a direct interest in life and property, and who did their best to protect it. Other people's dikes assigned to the people for protection have not collapsed, so the disaster victims in various counties are quite dissatisfied with Zhang Lianjia.</p>
<h3>Tianjin's Various Economic Organizations Are Established One After Another; The East Asia Tonghui Company Emerges; The East Asia Economic Association Is Formed</h3>
<p>Tianjin Communication: Niu Chuanqi, Shen Tongwu, Liu Xiangye, Chen Dingyuan, Chen Zeliang, and others, under the pretext of promoting economic cooperation in East Asia and developing various industries, have formed the East Asia Economic Association. The association has been preparing since the middle of last month, and was officially opened on the 3rd at No. 1 Yongping Lane, Mingli Street, Japanese Concession. Niu Chuanqi, Shen Tongwu, and Liu Xiangye are in charge of everything. It is heard that the purpose is to introduce Japanese capital into the industrial circles of Tianjin, Hebei, and major cities in North China in the name of helping development, and to purchase raw materials produced in China on behalf of Japanese industrial companies. In terms of its nature, it is probably an introducing agency. However, it is also heard that the association is backed by a branch of the newly established Japanese International Banking Company in Tianjin, and all plans are instructed by the company. In addition to this association, Gao Ling and Wang Shuangqi and others have initiated the North China Economic Relief Committee. The proposal to organize the association was made earlier than the East Asia Economic Association, but later, due to the proposal of the Japanese military to set up a staff headquarters and the Xingzhong Company in Tianjin, it was intended to incorporate the association, so the progress was somewhat suspended. Now, Gao Ben Lulang, chairman of the Sino-Japanese Industrial Company for North China Economic Cooperation, believes that the association still needs to be organized independently, and specially promoted the realization of the association. It is also heard that there are many similar organizations, all in the process of brewing.</p>
<p>The Tianjin Chamber of Commerce held a joint meeting of executive and supervisory committees on the 1st of this month, and resolved to organize the East Asia Tonghui Trading Company. It nominated Pan Yansheng (president of Junqian Hospital in the Japanese Concession), Bian Shoujing (former speaker of the Zhili Provincial Assembly), Yu Fuchen (former secretary of the Construction Bureau), Niu Huiqing (recommended by Sakai, staff officer of the Japanese Garrison), Gong Wenqing (professor of the Japanese Garrison), and Liu Yibai, Lu Junyu, Chen Houwen, and Cao Dianqiu as members of the preparatory committee, with Pan Yansheng concurrently serving as director of the preparatory committee. On the afternoon of the 3rd, the first preparatory meeting was held again at the Chamber of Commerce, and Pan Yansheng, Bian Shoujing, and Niu Huiqing were nominated as drafters to draft the organizational charter, establishing an import-export and Japanese goods introduction company in Tianjin for the entire dumping plan. The North China Japanese Garrison fully sponsored it, and the municipal government had not even heard of the proposal beforehand. The association has not been registered with the official authorities, but its organization is very active. (4th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Verdict on the Case of the Special Committee Member Shooting and Killing a Person</h3>
<p>Min Xiaozhang and Chen Zihe, members who handle special affairs, received a report from an informant last month that Zhu Qinbo, who was suspected of something, was to be arrested in Wuzhen. Under the pretext of randomly checking household registration, the suspect was lured out. During the dispute, Committee Member Chen and others shot and killed Zhu Qinbo's father, Fu Zhen. The villagers were indignant and beat the committee members and injured them. They were taken to the county government and transferred to the local court for interrogation. A report was submitted to the superiors, and the two committee members Chen and Min were dismissed. The case has been tried repeatedly and the verdict was announced on the morning of this day. The master of the case briefly stated that the defendant Chen Zihe was sentenced to five years of imprisonment for murder, and Min Xiaozhang was fined 40 yuan for negligent injury. Zhu Qinbo and Zhu Wenshan were fined 15 yuan for illegally depriving people of their freedom. Zhu Xinshan was fined 15 yuan for the part of hurting people. Zhu Shushan and Zhu Deshan were found not guilty. Chen Zihe should compensate Zhu Zhu for 100 yuan for the cost of the coffin. The fines were enforced against each defendant, and those who were unable to pay would be replaced with one day of labor for each yuan. After the judgment was completed, Chen and others were taken back into custody.</p>
<h3>Qingpu: The County Government Arrests the Guan Chuan Members</h3>
<p>The county government suddenly dispatched a large number of public security teams and the entire class of bailiffs at 11:00 AM yesterday to arrest the Guan Chuan members. As a result, 11 people, including Lu Chunsen, Huai Ansheng, and Zhang Rujun, were arrested. Fifteen people have not been arrested. By 4:00 PM, the residences of Guan Chuan members Yan Bingyong and Wang Zhenhuan were sealed by the county government, and family members were summoned. The remaining arrests are still being carried out strictly. It is heard that the content of the case and the reason for the arrests is that there are a total of 26 Guan Chuan members in this county, and their offices have always been in private residences, which has been the case for many years. Recently, the county government believes that it is inappropriate for the Guan Chuan members to work in private residences. The county magistrate summoned all the Guan Chuan members for a training session on August 29th, saying: 1. Those with pending cases must not serve as Guan Chuan members; 2. Those with concurrent jobs must not serve as Guan Chuan members; 3. Guan Chuan members who are unwilling to comply should immediately declare their resignation and wait for another appointment. Those who do not arrive at the government office by 8:00 AM on the 31st will be deemed to have resigned; 4. Regardless of whether Guan Chuan members are retained or retired, all public property and booklets should be submitted to the county government. They must not leave the government before they are cleared. At that time, each Guan Chuan member said that the public property booklets were all at home, and most of the family members were illiterate, so they certainly could not hand them over one by one. Therefore, Qin Shuqiu, the collection director, and Lu Chunsen, the Guan Chuan director, issued a guarantee, limiting each Guan Chuan member to hand them over to the county government the next day. Each Guan Chuan member did hand them over on time the next day. However, when the deadline of the 31st arrived, each Guan Chuan member believed that working in the county government would reduce work efficiency, so they followed the third point of Magistrate Qian's training and did not come to the government to express their resignation. Magistrate Qian believed that it was a resistance to government orders, so he dispatched a large number of armed public security teams and others to arrest them yesterday (the 4th). When the arrest order was issued, the doors of the collection office and the telephone room were guarded by police, and the situation was unusually tense. The arrested Guan Chuan members were immediately taken to the detention center. Various local agencies, unaware of the truth about the sudden arrest of a large number of Guan Chuan members by the county government, sent representatives to visit the county magistrate to inquire about the truth. The county magistrate, believing that the situation was serious, was inconvenient to explain, and the representatives left without any information.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: The Crystal Daily Reporter's Case Opens</h3>
<p>The case of Wu County Crystal Daily reporter Wang Zhuxin being sued for defamation by Lu Guanhui, a Suzhou gentleman from Tianguanfang, opened in the local court yesterday morning (the 6th). The plaintiff did not arrive and was represented by lawyer Wu Chao. The defendant Wang Zhuxin arrived at the court with lawyers Zhuang Xiangren and Tian Qiang to respond to the interrogation. After being interrogated by Judge Shen Bingrong, the defendant Wang Zhuxin was released on bail to await a scheduled retrial. The plaintiff's lawyer was instructed that Lu Guanhui should personally attend the next court hearing.</p>
<h3>The Highway Bureau Stops the Opening of the Su-Mu Road</h3>
<p>After the completion of the Su-Mu section of the Su-Fu Highway, it started operating on the 1st of this month, selling tickets and carrying passengers. The business was still fairly good, but Director Shen of the Provincial Highway Bureau believed that the Su-Mu Road had not yet obtained a business license, so how could it be opened and operated without permission? Yesterday, he specially telegraphed the Wu County Construction Bureau, ordering them to stop the opening of the road in order to comply with the regulations. The Su-Fu Long-Distance Bus Company stated that although it had not yet obtained a business license, it had already obtained a test driving permit from the Construction Bureau, so it submitted a request to the Highway Bureau, stating everything and requesting the issuance of a business license.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Frequent Zhenxin Labor Strikes</h3>
<p>The Zhenxin Yarn Factory outside the West Gate experienced a labor strike in mid-July. The factory stated that it was unable to maintain operations due to the high cost of cotton and the low price of yarn, so it stopped work at the end of July. The workers, however, stated that the factory had not paid their wages for June and July, leading to a major strike. After the Party and government, together with the Chamber of Commerce, made great efforts to mediate, two installments of wages were paid on August 5th and 9th, and it was announced that work would resume in one month, and the strike was quelled. Later, Manager Jiang Zheqing went to Shanghai for medical treatment and sent a letter from the board of directors announcing his resignation. Associate Manager Rong Xuxin hid and refused to meet, so no one was responsible. The one-month deadline for resuming work has arrived. Hua Shaocun, the business director, contacted the Party and government and the workers, and it was agreed that work would resume immediately after the new cotton was launched. Before the negotiations could be completed, Manager Jiang Zheqing suddenly telegraphed the staff from Shanghai, telling them to return to their respective homes and wait for notification to return to the factory when a car was available. At the same time, the factory's electric lights were cut off and food was stopped. The staff were greatly panicked, because the factory had not paid the salaries for August, and many of the staff came from Hunan, Jiangxi, and other provinces. Now, it was impossible to stay and impossible to leave. Therefore, more than 40 staff members, including Wang Zhiping, found the director of affairs, Qin Liangcai, and together they petitioned the county Party headquarters and demanded three things from the factory: (1) Pay the salaries for August; (2) If there is no hope of opening the factory, a severance fee must be paid; (3) Staff from other provinces must be given travel expenses. The two committee members Sun and Xu of the Party headquarters instructed them to wait patiently for mediation. The staff then dragged Qin Liangcai back to the factory, vowing to share the joys and sorrows. On the workers' side, because the factory treated the staff like this, all the savings and unpaid wages would definitely be lost. Yesterday, they also went to the Party headquarters in groups to request relief. The factory's disputes are numerous, and it is feared that they cannot be resolved in a short time.</p>
<h3>Modification of New Measuring Instruments for the Rice and Bean Industry</h3>
<p>The local county government, in order to implement the new system of weights and measures, originally intended to facilitate the daily needs of the people and standardize goods. Since its implementation in this county, all industries in the region have complied and adopted it. Various districts and townships have been repeatedly urged to purchase new instruments and replace the old ones on schedule. However, with the exception of length and weight measures which have been replaced, there are still many who procrastinate and wait when it comes to measuring instruments, and have not yet complied. This has led to discrepancies and confusion in commercial transactions, easily breeding malpractices. In order to strictly enforce uniformity, all grain shops, stores, warehouses, and businesses in the county are required to uniformly use the new system of "sheng" and "dou" measures starting from September 15th of this year. Those who continue to outwardly comply but secretly violate the regulations by privately using the old system, once discovered through inspection, will be severely punished according to Chapter 13 of the criminal law. A public notice was specifically issued yesterday to inform everyone. Regarding the conversion of new and old measuring instruments: 1 dou equals 1 shi, which is approximately equivalent to 9 dou and 3 sheng and 4 he of the tribute grain measure. 1 dou of the tribute grain measure equals 1 shi and 0.07 sheng of the market measure.</p>
<h3>Changzhou - Suicide by Hanging Due to Economic Hardship</h3>
<p>Fei Rongsheng, a resident outside the North Gate of Wu County, was over 40 years old and worked as a woodworker. His wife and children had passed away in previous years. Recently, due to the lack of work, he was unable to make a living, and developed a pessimistic view of life. Around 7 PM on the 5th, he hanged himself in front of his bed and died. Afterwards, the neighborhood chief, Lü Jinhong, reported it to the Second Public Security Precinct and requested that the local court send personnel to conduct an autopsy.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin - Labor Unrest Calmed at Hua Cheng Cloth Factory</h3>
<p>Female workers at the Hua Cheng Dyeing and Weaving Second Cloth Factory went on strike on the 2nd due to wage issues. Female worker Xu Er-mei and others were dismissed, and over 20 female workers went on a full strike, petitioning the Party headquarters and demanding that the factory accept two conditions: (1) Dismissed female workers to be reinstated; (2) Restore wages. On the morning of the 4th, Special Commissioner Zhang invited Hua Cheng manager Han Xi'an and Section Chief Ge Shaowu of the county government's First Section to meet and discuss for two hours. By the afternoon, it was decided that the dismissed female workers would be allowed to return to work. As for the issue of restoring wages, a wage standard would be determined after the County Party Headquarters, together with the County Government, sent personnel to the factory to investigate the actual economic situation. The female workers were satisfied and uniformly returned to work on the 5th.</p>
<h3>Nantong - New Cotton from Tongzhou, Rugao, and Hai'an Has Entered the Market</h3>
<p>Tongzhou, Rugao, and Hai'an counties are prosperous cotton-producing areas. This year, due to favorable weather conditions of sunshine and rain, coupled with autumn heat, the cotton crop is in excellent condition. The harvest season has now arrived. According to estimates by the provincial Langshan Cotton Farm, the output of medium cotton and miscellaneous cotton within the region is approximately 923,000 shi. New cotton from the surrounding villages has entered the market. Cotton merchants from the Jiangnan region are flocking north to set up shops and purchase goods, and the financial market has become lively.</p>
<h3>Yuxi Cracks Down on Illegal Opium Trafficking Case</h3>
<p>After learning that Zhou Ruzhong's family in Yuxi was selling illegal opium, anti-narcotics investigators went to search the premises. Zhou was out at the time, and his wife and daughter panicked, attempting to pour the opium into a chamber pot. They were intercepted with witnesses and evidence, and were taken to the county government for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Haimen - Large Quantity of Illegal Opium Intercepted</h3>
<p>Wu Tingfang (also known as "Little Guangdong"), a notorious opium trafficker from Qidong Weijiao Town, transported and sold illegal opium in Haimen and Qidong counties in large quantities, profiting handsomely. The day before yesterday afternoon, he had 16 packages of illegal opium, weighing a total of 228 taels and worth over 600 yuan, transported from Shanghai, hidden in the bottom of a shoe basket, and delivered to his home by rickshaw puller Chen Xilin. Unexpectedly, the information was leaked, and someone secretly reported it to the County Anti-Narcotics Association. The police were dispatched and intercepted the rickshaw puller in Nanshi, Weijiao Town, and brought him and the illicit goods to the association for investigation. Wu Tingfang fled upon hearing the news and could not be captured.</p>
<h3>Pinghu - Murdered Female Corpse Found in City River</h3>
<p>On the evening of the 4th, a floating corpse was discovered in the city river in front of the Chenghuang Temple. The local bailiff reported it to the authorities, who requested an autopsy. Coroner Du Cheng took the coroner to the scene and determined that the corpse was that of a woman, around twenty years old. Her mouth was open, her tongue was curled up, her abdomen had been cut open with a knife, her intestines were protruding, and one foot had rotted and the skin had peeled off. It was clearly a case of murder followed by disposal of the body in the water. One theory is that the corpse floated from Jiaxing. Because it was the spring tide that day, the currents were extremely swift, and the corpse floated through the city and into the East Lake area, stopping in front of the Chenghuang Temple due to the river embankment. The corpse has been placed in a coffin and temporarily buried in the public cemetery pending investigation.</p>
<h3>Ningbo - Red Pill Female Trafficker Executed by Firing Squad</h3>
<p>Dong Zhangshi, a widow from Shipu Shuimentou in Xiangshan, operated a small store in name but sold red pills in reality. In April, when Hu Quanhu was buying red pills from Dong Zhangshi, he was apprehended on the spot by police officers from the Second Public Security Precinct. The evidence and illicit goods were transferred to the county government for investigation. The suspect confessed to the trafficking without denial and was sentenced to death according to the law. The case file was submitted to the commissioner's office and then to the military headquarters for review. Subsequently, Execution Order No. 4399 and Commissioner's Office Order No. 1368 were received, approving the execution. The suspect was taken out yesterday morning at 7 AM, her identity was confirmed, and she was escorted to the West Parade Ground for execution by firing squad.</p>
<h3>Passenger on Ningxing Steamer Jumps into the Sea</h3>
<p>On the previous day, a male passenger in his twenties with a Suzhou accent, traveling on the Sanbei Company's Ningxing steamer from Shanghai to Ningbo, occupied a berth on the starboard side of the third deck. He had no luggage. After the ship sailed out of the Wusong Estuary, the passenger suddenly jumped off the deck into the sea. Upon receiving the report, the captain turned the ship around, but there was no way to rescue him. Afterwards, the ship's crew found a diary in his berth with three letters written in pencil: one to his parents, one to his wife, and one to his wife's younger brother and sister-in-law. On the back page of the diary, the phrase "A happy couple / A hateful enemy" was written, followed by the name "Jiemei" and an English signature. The phonetic transcription of the name was Tao Jiemei. Because the first page of his diary contained the words "Respectfully requesting that this photo be reproduced in the newspaper so that my family in Wu County may understand my fate, I would be eternally grateful," it was clear that the deceased was a resident of Suzhou named Tao Jiemei. As there was no address for the ship's crew to send the items to, they had to keep all of his belongings for safekeeping.</p>
<h3>Mingguang - Bandits Rob Merchants at Huayuanzui</h3>
<p>Ding Denian, a grain merchant from this port, along with his companions Chen and others, carried over 1,500 yuan and traveled by boat to buy grain outside the river. Unexpectedly, last night when the boat arrived at Huayuanzui, over a dozen bandits dressed in uniforms and speaking with a Haizhou accent suddenly boarded the ship with guns, claiming to be conducting an inspection. They robbed Ding and his companions of all their money. Ding, sensing danger, escaped in the chaos. The whereabouts of Chen and the others are unknown.</p>

<h3>Urgently Raised Loan of 143,000 Yuan for Disaster Relief; Banks to Sign First</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fundraising Association for Flood Relief in Various Provinces has negotiated with Shanghai banks for a loan of 500,000 yuan to cover immediate relief efforts. The loan agreement for 300,000 yuan from the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications has already been signed, and funds can be withdrawn from the three banks at any time as needed. As for the 200,000 yuan from the member banks of the Bankers' Association, the association has made every effort to persuade the member banks to contribute, and 143,000 yuan has already been pledged. The association is continuing to persuade banks to make up the shortfall. Because this loan is for urgent relief, the association copied the amount pledged by each member bank, along with the agreed-upon loan agreement format, and sent it to the relief association yesterday by letter. The relief association will then finalize the agreements and sign them with the banks that have pledged funds. The loan term is six months, and funds can be withdrawn directly from each bank at any time after the agreements are signed.</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 6th), this newspaper received the following donations for flood relief in various provinces: Xu Huang Haide, 30 yuan (one check from Commercial Savings Bank, No. B3446157); Peng Shaoqu, 20 yuan; Situ Zheng, Li Yinji, Li Anji, 10 yuan each; Lü Yinghao, Zhou Zongye, 5 yuan each; Student Self-Government Association of Jinglin Elementary School, Shi Danxian, anonymous (receipt no. 7353), Wu Zhenying, Lei Yutian, Mai Guo, 2 yuan each; Luo Futang, Guo Jinghu, Lin Changjun, Zhu Baokang, Wang Genmei, Zhu Yufeng, Qiang Guanfu, Lin Changsong, Luo Guangtian, Qu Bogao, 1 yuan each, totaling 132 yuan.</p>
<h3>Speech by Li Liejun: Wishes the People of China to Strive for Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Teachings; Plans to Reside in Wuxi and Attend the Plenary Session</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Central Committee member Li Liejun has been recuperating in Qingdao since May, and his health has gradually improved. With the Sixth Plenary Session about to open, he returned to Shanghai on the 5th to prepare to attend in Peking. He then learned that the Sixth Plenary Session had been postponed to November 1st, so he plans to reside in Wuxi for a short time. He has already sent personnel to Wuxi to find suitable housing in the Yuantouzhu area. Li met with reporters from various newspapers at his private residence on Masinan Road on the morning of the 6th and made the following remarks: (Question) Will you attend the Sixth Plenary Session? Do you have any proposals? (Answer) I originally planned to travel to Peking in the coming days to attend the plenary session, but since the session has been postponed, I will return to the mountains to recuperate. I have studied the proposals. What I emphasize is self-reliance. (Question) What is the current situation of Mr. Feng Huanzhang? It is said that he has a proposal for the plenary session that he entrusted to you to bring to Peking. Is that true? (Answer) Mr. Feng is concerned about the country and the people, and is diligent in his studies, as always. I am in regular communication with Mr. Feng. Huanzhang has prepared a proposal, the gist of which is as reported in the newspapers. At the meeting, personnel will be sent from Taishan to Peking to deliver it. I am not currently going to Taishan, so there may be a misunderstanding. Li also said, "The greatest danger facing our country today is the dispersal of people's hearts and the failure to unite national strength. Dr. Sun Yat-sen spoke of this in the past, and he also explained the method of salvation. Therefore, if we seek self-reliance, we must still work hard on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and the policies he set forth. If there is a need for me to serve, I will of course do my best."</p>

<h3>Stamp Tax Ambiguity Incident; Suspension of Inspection and Penalties</h3>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed Ministry of Finance for Adoption</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing yesterday, stating: "To the esteemed Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, the association has repeatedly telegraphed your ministry requesting clarification on various points of ambiguity regarding the stamp tax law. We have also read a special dispatch from Nanjing in the local newspapers of the 3rd, stating that your ministry is currently considering opinions on this matter and will submit them to the Executive Yuan for review and referral to the Legislative Yuan. This shows your utmost sincerity in seeking convenience for the people through careful and thorough consideration. Before a uniform interpretation and approval of these types of incidents is circulated, we request that your ministry order the inspection personnel in all areas to temporarily suspend the inspection of documents under consideration. If they have already been inspected, temporarily suspend the submission for review. If they have already been submitted for review, request that the court temporarily suspend acceptance. Even if the Legislative Yuan's interpretation in the future considers them subject to stamping, they should be allowed to pay the required rate as a supplement and not be penalized for tax evasion. This would be consistent with your ministry's intent to seek fairness and impartiality. We respectfully request that you review, approve, adopt, and implement this proposal. Sincerely, Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi Returned to Shanghai Yesterday Morning; Talked About His Inspection of the Yellow River Disaster</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, recently went to Shandong to inspect the Yellow River disaster and returned to Peking the day before yesterday. He took the night train to Shanghai that evening and arrived at the North Station at 7:15 AM yesterday morning. He immediately went to his private residence on West Ain Street for rest. At noon, he went to the Central Bank to handle important matters and met with reporters, making the following remarks:</p>
<p>Three Main Reasons for Inspecting the Yellow River Disaster</p>
<p>As the Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Council, responsible for water conservancy affairs, I have been concerned about the successive disasters of the Yangtze River and the Yellow River. After inspecting the Yangtze River upstream last time, I returned east and immediately decided to continue to Shandong to inspect the Yellow River disaster. There were three main reasons for this trip north: (1) To communicate the opinions on Yellow River prevention between Jiangsu and Shandong provinces. After arriving in Xuzhou, I invited Shao Hanyuan, Commissioner of Xuzhou, to accompany me to inspect the flood in Shandong Province and introduced Shao to Chairman Han of Shandong to discuss everything. (2) To represent the central government in expressing its concern for the displaced people and to comfort the disaster-stricken elders. (3) To discuss with Chairman Han of Shandong measures to block the breaches and provide emergency relief. This inspection trip north made me feel optimistic about the future of our country. For example, the people provided their own dry food and worked hard on the projects. Even after suffering a great calamity, they did not complain or blame others. As for the civil servants in various places, from the provincial chairman down to the commissioners and county magistrates, they were able to share the joys and sorrows of the people and work hard to rescue them. The troops along the Jinpu Railway have always been disciplined, and the army and the people have a good relationship. This time, they also participated in the flood control projects, which shows that the army and the people have truly become one.</p>
<p>Diversion to Qufu; Reverently Visited the Lin Temple</p>
<p>This year was the birthday of the late teacher Confucius, and I originally planned to go to Shandong to visit the temple, but I was unable to do so due to busy official duties. This time, I took the opportunity to go to Yanzhou and diverted to Qufu to reverently visit the Lin Temple. The garrison in Yanzhou is Sun Tonghuang's troops. Commander Sun's troops have always been known for their discipline, and after stationing in Yanzhou, they implemented a military-industrial policy, filling in the stinking water pit next to the Yanzhou Station and rebuilding it into a garden. They also established the Jindehui to have fun with the people. The road from Yanzhou to Qufu is wide, flat, and smooth, and it was also built by Sun's soldiers. All of this is enough to show the progress of our country. This is what I am pleased and comforted by after inspecting the devastation and suffering caused by the great disaster.</p>
<p>Reasons for Postponement of the Sixth Plenary Session</p>
<p>Regarding the postponement of the Sixth Plenary Session, since the Fifth National Congress has already been decided to be held on November 12th of this year, if the Sixth Plenary Session were to be held at the originally scheduled time, there would be only a little over a month in between, and the members would have to travel back and forth, which would take a lot of time. Therefore, in order to save time, it was decided to postpone it to November 1st.</p>
<p>Economic Council Will Discuss Disaster Relief Next Week</p>
<p>The National Economic Council's regular meeting was originally scheduled to be held yesterday (that is, the day before yesterday) afternoon in Peking, but because only President Wang and I were in Peking at the time, it could not be held. It is planned to postpone it until next week to discuss disaster relief and prevention in detail.</p>
<p>The National Flood Relief Association Declares that Bank Advances Will Be Repaid Responsibly</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Shanghai Flood Relief Association is borrowing 500,000 yuan from banks to deal with emergency relief, and loan agreements have been signed one after another, and payment can be allocated to various provinces for relief and relief. Last night, a newspaper reported that if the funds raised failed to meet the advance payment of 500,000 yuan after six months, the association intended to ask the banks to make up the shortfall as bank donations. The reporter of the newspaper went to the relief association to inquire about this matter, and the person in charge of the association replied that this news was completely misinformation. Xu Shiying, Wang Zhen, and other leading figures of the association have handled relief work for many years, and they have borrowed money from banks many times, and all of them have been paid off with principal and interest. There has never been any default. This fundraising association is organized by leaders from all walks of life in Shanghai, and they are actively carrying out fundraising and other matters. The work is very tense. All efforts will be done to pay off the 500,000 yuan in advance, including principal and interest.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry; Recent News from Wenxi Paper Mill; Increase in Capital to 4.5 Million Yuan; Plant Site Changed to Mawan, West of Wenzhou</h3>
<p>Recognizing the weakness of the domestic paper industry and the alarming number of newsprint imports each year, the Ministry of Industry has proposed to establish a factory near Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, to manufacture newsprint. Since the establishment of the Wenxi Paper Mill Preparatory Committee, it has been actively preparing and sparing no effort. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency learned from the person in charge of the preparatory committee yesterday that the factory's plan is slightly different from what was previously reported in the newspapers. It is said that the factory was originally planned to be located in Wenxi, on the south bank of the Ou River in Yongjia County, Zhejiang Province, using hydroelectric power. That is why the factory was named Wenxi Paper Mill. However, after foreign engineers and experts from the Ministry of Industry went to Wenxi to investigate, they determined that Wenxi's terrain was too low and that there was a risk of flooding in the future. Therefore, after several discussions and several meetings of the preparatory committee and the technical review committee, it was decided that the factory site would not be in Wenxi, but would instead be located in Mawan, 20 kilometers west of Wenzhou, on the north bank of the Ou River. Although the area there is not very large, there is still enough space for future expansion of the factory. The most satisfying thing is that the terrain there is high, and with some filling work, there will be no risk of flooding in the future. As for the future power generation problem, because the stream water flow records are only three years old and are not sufficient to rely on for sufficient water power, and because the construction of a dam would be a huge project that would cost too much, the plan to use hydroelectric power was abandoned. It was decided to use coal-fired steam to power the machinery. In this way, more than one million yuan in costs could be reduced. After the two preconditions of the factory site and the power source were resolved, the paper mill preparatory committee convened its fifth decision-making meeting. The committee members agreed that since the factory site was not located in Wenxi, the original factory name could no longer be used. In order to adapt to the environment and facilitate future foreign trade, it was resolved to change the name to China Paper Corporation and to increase the original capital of 4 million yuan to 4.5 million yuan. Among them, 3.9 million yuan of government shares would be borrowed from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund, which is no problem. The public share portion has also been publicly raised. It is reported that after the fifth meeting, the preparatory committee submitted all plans to the Ministry of Industry and requested the Gengzi Fund Board to quickly allocate funds to purchase a large number of machines and purchase land to build the factory buildings.</p>
<p>Relief is Life-Saving; Donate One More Penny; Save One More Life</p>
<h3>China Cotton Textile Association Announces Statistics on China's Cotton Industry for the First Half of the Year</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the China Cotton Textile Association announced statistics on China's cotton industry for the first half of this year (January to June 1935). The number of spindles in operation was 4,809,559, which is only 12,467 more than the number of spindles in operation in the second half of the previous year (1934), which was 4,797,090. Comparing the two, the number of spindles in operation in the second half of last year increased by 98,820 compared to the first half of last year, and the number of spindles in operation in the first half of last year increased by 80,066 compared to the second half of the previous year. This comparison proves the weakness of the yarn industry. As for the consumption of raw cotton, the total consumption in the first half of this year was 1,172,500 bales (500 pounds per bale), which is also less than the 1,328,000 bales of raw cotton consumed in the second half of last year.</p>

<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Submits Another Petition Urging the Enactment of a Law Mandating Compulsory Membership in Trade Associations</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce submitted a petition to the Ministry of Industry, stating: "Regarding the petition, on the 4th of this month, we received a letter from the Cotton Cloth Trade Association stating that the association's membership, during its peak, reached over 340 firms. Recently, it has dwindled to 163. Comparing members and non-members, the ratio used to be two to three, but now it is one to four. After investigating the reasons, it was found that business declined after the January 28th Incident, with bankruptcies following one after another. This is a secondary cause of the membership decline. However, the main cause is that members must accept various restrictions and fulfill various obligations, while non-members can remain carefree and unrestricted. No one is foolish enough not to emulate the latter's behavior. Although the regulations for the organization of trade associations have been led by your association and followed by various other trade associations, with repeated appeals and strenuous efforts, the legislative authorities only changed the word 'may' to 'should' in the implementing rules regarding membership. Although the meaning is more definite, there is still no compulsory measure against non-members. Therefore, in terms of effectiveness, it is still equal to zero. For example, although various industry regulations stipulate that both members and non-members should comply, compliance is compliance, and disruption is disruption. Since there is no power to force non-members to become members, it is impossible to prevent them from disrupting. In terms of assisting social undertakings, such as national salvation, aviation, water, drought, and other donations, as well as the payment of association and chamber of commerce fees, everything must be taken from the members, while non-members do not contribute. They are engaged in the same business, so why favor them over us? How can the group achieve soundness and prevent the members from scattering? Our association, considering the current situation, feels that unless membership in the association is compulsory for all those in the same industry, the function of the group cannot be brought into play, and the foundation of the association cannot be consolidated. Therefore, at the sixth members' general meeting held on August 31st, upon the proposal of fellow members, it was decided to write to the City Chamber of Commerce to forward to the government authorities, requesting the swift formulation of compulsory measures for non-members, etc. Considering the above reasons, we respectfully submit this letter, hoping you will investigate and handle it, and we look forward to a reply.</p>
<p>Upon receiving this letter, the issue of formulating methods for implementing compulsory membership has been a long-standing and unresolved problem for years. The subordinate associations have repeatedly presented the critical situation of various industries. On April 15th, we submitted a request to your association to incorporate the instructions in the approval No. 29205 of October of the previous year into the implementing rules so that they could be used as a basis for court prosecution when necessary. Subsequently, at the sixth members' general meeting of the subordinate association on June 23rd, members again proposed a motion to formulate compulsory membership measures. It was again resolved to submit a petition to your ministry on June 24th based on the original petition of April 15th, urging a swift handling of the matter. To date, no approval has been received. In recent years, local and central authorities have entrusted the trade associations with commercial surveys and national salvation, water, drought, aviation, and other donations. However, in reality, the scope of membership is limited, and the power to call upon is extremely weak. The cotton cloth industry, which is a relatively well-established and long-standing organization, is still as described in the original letter, and the rest need not be discussed. The strength of the organization of various industries depends on the outcome of this case. We have been eagerly awaiting for several years. It is reasonable to truthfully submit this report, hoping that your ministry will review and approve the various sections submitted previously and promptly discuss and implement them, which would be in the public interest."</p>
<h3>Sponsored by the Chinese Institute of Engineers: National Building Materials Exhibition, Held at the Industrial Testing Laboratory in the City Center, Concurrently with the National Games</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Chinese Institute of Engineers, in view of the rapid progress of China's industrial and commercial undertakings in recent years, with factories springing up and new methods emerging, especially in the field of building materials, whose applications are becoming increasingly widespread, regrettably lacking adequate promotion, often relying on imported goods, causing a great drain of resources and affecting the development of industry and commerce to a great extent, has initiated a National Building Materials Exhibition, scheduled to open on Double Ten Day (October 10th) of this year in the new building of the Institute's Industrial Materials Testing Laboratory in the city center, for a period of ten days, as an official promotion for domestic goods manufacturers, to show the intention of assisting and promoting. Moreover, at that time, the National Games will be held at the Municipal Stadium in the city center, and there will be many spectators. If the manufacturers go there to display their products, the effect will be significant. All domestic building materials manufacturers are welcome to actively participate and enthusiastically support. Each factory can contact the Institute at No. 542 Continental Commercial Building, Nanjing Road, Shanghai, from now until the 12th, between 12:00 noon and 2:00 pm, to discuss everything.</p>
<h3>The Aviation Association Conducts a Second Round of Fundraising Efforts; The Association's Exhibition Hall Will Be Completed by the End of the Year; The China Flying Society Begins Preparations</h3>
<p>At the fourth board meeting of the China Aviation Association on January 15th of this year, it was decided to continue holding a second fundraising campaign in the city, with Mayor Wu Tiecheng again serving as the chief of the Shanghai fundraising team, Yao Xijiu as the chief of staff, and Li Dachao as the secretary-general, to expand the solicitation of new members and continue collecting membership fees, in order to raise aviation national salvation donations. The office of the chief of the fundraising team, Secretary-General Li, in accordance with the instructions of Chief Wu, began to plan and implement the plan, formulating a concise charter and various fundraising documents, and hiring 439 leaders from all walks of life in the city to serve as fundraising team leaders, and each team leader was asked to hire deputy team leaders and team members to assist in the implementation, with the goal of soliciting 100,000 new members and raising 1 million yuan in aviation national salvation donations as the overall achievement target. An office was set up at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA, divided into five sections: general affairs, finance, fundraising, promotion, and publicity. Zhang Yuliang, Zhou Songhe, Li Guogeng, Chen Shuo, Liu Songtao, Li Jiming, Zhu Shengyang, Song Zheng, Li Wanyao, Bao Lengxue, and more than ten others were hired as staff members to take charge of the work. The fundraising began on March 1st, and the teams worked very hard. More than 320 teams have successively submitted their achievements, and the other teams are currently compiling their results. In addition to the fundraising by the teams, the office directly conducted fundraising, holding wealthy donations, dividing the donations into four categories based on the economic situation of each wealthy individual: 5,000, 3,000, 2,000, and 1,000 yuan, and held public solicitation of members, sending letters to households and shops in the city equipped with telephones, and soliciting people from all walks of life to join as members, which was very enthusiastic. Even distant provinces, cities, and counties such as Hebei, Hunan, Fujian, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Beiping, Hangzhou, and Qingpu have requested to join as various types of members one after another. In addition, the collection of previous donations from various industries, the hotel industry, the fresh meat industry, and the fresh pork selling industry, which were organized by the second fundraising campaign, continued to be carried out. This time, the trucking industry was organized with a target of 100,000 yuan, starting on July 1st; the brick and ash transportation industry with a target of 20,000 yuan, starting on June 15th; the dance hall industry with no fixed donation amount, starting on August 15th; and the gravel industry with a target of 100,000 yuan, starting on August 21st. The assistance of the industry associations and people from all walks of life has been deeply appreciated, and the progress has been very smooth. Negotiations are underway with the chicken and duck industry, the restaurant industry, the rental car industry, the film industry, and the prostitution industry. This is the general situation of the second fundraising campaign. However, this matter is of great importance and relies on the collective efforts of everyone. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will generously contribute and enthusiastically donate to jointly accomplish this great undertaking.</p>
<p>The China Aviation Association, in order to develop its affairs and consolidate its foundation, is building an association hall and exhibition hall near the museum in the city center. The standing directors elected four directors, Wang Xiaolai, Cai Kanghou, Yao Xijiu, and Li Dachao, to be responsible for the preparations. A public tender was announced, and the Jiutai Guanji Construction Factory was contracted to construct the building. Since the start of construction, the second phase of the project has been completed. The entire project will be completed by the end of this year, and the office will be able to move in on New Year's Day next year, and a model airplane exhibition will be held to increase public interest and knowledge about aviation. In addition, the standing directors of the association, Wang Xiaolai, Wu Tiecheng, Lin Kanghou, Wang Zhengting, Huang Bingheng, Zhang Huichang, Yao Xijiu, Li Dachao, Yu Zhaolin, and others, recently held a meeting at the municipal government to discuss the organization of the China Flying Society, the establishment of funding, and the election of committee members. It is reported that preparations will begin immediately, with the aim of studying aviation academics, promoting civil aviation undertakings, assisting the government in developing civil aviation, and training civil aviation primary flight personnel.</p>
<p>After hearing about the fundraising for aviation donations from the trucking industry, various trucking companies have been actively paying 6 yuan per vehicle to the industry association as originally planned. It is reported that Shui An Company has two self-provided transport vehicles and yesterday specially paid 11 yuan for the September donation to the office of the commander-in-chief, which is commendable for their patriotic enthusiasm.</p>
<h3>Stamp Duty on Bills of Lading Issued by Shipping Companies: Still Handled According to the Old Rules</h3>
<p>The Shipping Industry Association sent a letter to its members, stating: "Regarding the implementation of the Stamp Duty Law on September 1st, our association believes that the tax rate stipulated in Article 16, Tariff Table, Item 12, of the law, which requires a stamp duty of 20 cents per bill of lading, is too heavy and cannot be borne. On August 17th, we sent a telegram to the Legislative Yuan requesting a revision to reduce the tax rate. The freight income from bills of lading for goods transported along the coast is sometimes less than one national currency unit, while the income of forwarding companies or freight forwarders from bills of lading is often higher than that of shipping companies. However, Item 13 of the same article stipulates that forwarding companies or freight forwarders' bills of lading only require a stamp duty of 2 cents. This comparison is unfair. Moreover, Item 12 of the same article stipulates that bills of lading issued by public shipping enterprises are exempt from stamp duty, which is inconsistent with the principle stated in the Provisional Constitution that the government should encourage and protect private shipping. Furthermore, the Japanese shipping companies' bills of lading only require a stamp duty of 3 cents per bill. Therefore, we have specifically requested the revision of the article based on the aforementioned reasons and facts.</p>
<p>After the Legislative Yuan sent out the telegram, our association also sent separate petitions to the Ministry of Finance, requesting them to forward the petition and to instruct their subordinates to allow the old rules to be followed until the Legislative Yuan approves the revision. At the same time, we also sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to review and forward the petition as soon as possible, requesting that the tax be reduced to ensure fairness and to maintain the shipping industry. Now, we have received a letter from the Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan, stating that the President of the Yuan has issued an incoming telegram, which states that Article 16, Item 12, of the Stamp Duty Law stipulates that a stamp duty of 20 cents per shipping bill of lading is too heavy and requests a revision to reduce the tax, etc. The approval was given to the Finance Committee for review. In addition to forwarding this to you for your review, etc., the association's request to revise the article and reduce the stamp duty on shipping bills of lading has been accepted by the Legislative Yuan, and there is hope that the revision will be approved. The association, fearing that the stamp duty enforcement agency might be too lenient in its punishments, has recently submitted a further petition to the Ministry of Finance, stating that the case has been accepted by the Legislative Yuan and requesting that its subordinates be instructed to review the case and continue to handle the stamp duty on shipping bills of lading according to the old rules. This is the process by which the association petitioned to revise the article, reduce the stamp duty on shipping bills of lading, and request that its subordinates be instructed to handle the case according to the old rules.</p>
<p>According to the investigation, Shanghai shipping bills of lading have traditionally been divided into those issued at the South Customs and those issued at the North Customs. Those issued at the South Customs are for goods from the inland. The association invited its members to discuss this matter in 1928. The members agreed that since the bills of lading do not specify the amount of money, it would be difficult to affix stamps according to the progressive method. They requested that a uniform stamp duty of 4 cents be affixed to each bill. Subsequently, the Shanghai South District Branch of the Jiangsu Stamp Duty Office replied that it was not convenient to change the tax rate without authorization. The matter was presented to the Director-General of the General Office when he was in Jin Province, and he was asked for instructions on how to handle the matter. He also stated that it was not convenient to freely change the legally prescribed regulations. Even if there were obstacles and difficulties in implementation, it was necessary to request the government to revise the regulations through legal procedures. Currently, the average stamp duty affixed to each bill of lading is 4 cents, which is too different from the originally determined tax rate, and it is difficult to approve in practice. Now, it has been found that some provincial shipping bills of lading affix a stamp duty of 10 cents per bill. Although this is still inconsistent with the progressive method stipulated in the regulations, it does not damage tax revenue. For the convenience of merchants, it seems that a temporary expedient method can be adopted, etc. This was sent to you for review and to inform the various shipping companies that all bills of lading must affix a stamp duty of 10 cents per bill to ensure uniformity and avoid disputes, etc. This is the situation regarding stamp duty on bills of lading issued at the South Customs. As for the North Customs, the goods are those from trading ports. The association invited the customs declaration offices to discuss this matter. Subsequently, a reply was received stating that the General Chamber of Commerce had previously sent a letter regarding the affixing of stamp duty to bills of lading. The representative of the Ministry of Finance stated that the Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs had submitted a report stating that the tax and levy bills mentioned in the Chamber of Commerce's letter were tantamount to taxing taxes. According to Category 2 of the Stamp Duty Regulations, stamps were originally affixed to bills of lading. However, in order to facilitate merchants, an expedient method was adopted to change the practice to affixing stamps to tax and levy bills according to the amount, which is not a tax on taxes, etc. This was forwarded to you for review and then notified to the various industries for compliance. Therefore, the stamp duty on bills of lading has already been ordered to be affixed to tax and levy bills. Therefore, Tian Yong will not participate in the matter again, etc. This is the situation regarding stamp duty on bills of lading issued at the North Customs. Because the methods in the North and South cities are different, the association can only request that the old rules continue to be followed. Fearing that the various chambers of commerce may not be clear about this, we have included this information for your reference. We hereby issue this notice, hoping that you will review and handle it."</p>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association announced yesterday that some shipping companies charge as little as 50 cents of national currency for freight income from bills of lading. Some ships issue hundreds of bills of lading per voyage. However, Article 16, Item 12 of the Stamp Duty Law, which came into effect on September 1st, stipulates that a stamp duty of 20 cents must be affixed to each shipping bill of lading, which is too heavy a tax rate and unfair, and cannot be borne by shipping merchants. Moreover, the same article states that bills of lading issued by public shipping enterprises are exempt from stamp duty, which is inconsistent with the principle of Article 36 of the Provisional Constitution that the state should encourage and protect private shipping. The association has petitioned the government to revise the article to reduce the tax and requested equal treatment with public enterprises. At the same time, it has requested the authorities to temporarily handle the matter according to the old rules before the revision is made. We hereby issue this notice for your public consideration.</p>
<h3>Children's Year of Happiness: Matters Requiring Attention by Charitable Organizations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Association sent a circular to various charitable organizations, stating: "Regarding the letter from the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, which states: 'Regarding the order No. 15264 from the Municipal Government, which states: "Regarding the order No. 4263 from the Executive Yuan, which states: 'Regarding the order No. 607 from the National Government on July 31, 1935, which states: "In order to comply with the order, we have found that children are the foundation of the national life. As the Children's Year begins, all organs, schools, and social groups across the country should follow all laws and regulations and do their best to implement them in order to seek the welfare of children. Regarding matters related to the happiness of children in our country, such as school-age children receiving compulsory education, children in school receiving excellent knowledge and physical training, pregnant women receiving new methods of childbirth, infants and young children receiving increased health and prevention of infectious diseases, there are clear provisions in the current Provisional Constitution, as well as various education laws and regulations, health plans, and sports plans. In addition, the protection of children's lives and benefits, the age of employment of child laborers and apprentices, and the restrictions on working hours, etc., have been detailed in special articles in the current Criminal Law and Factory Law. As for international conventions prohibiting the trafficking of women and children, they have been jointly signed by our country and various countries. If we can implement them one by one, it will be of great benefit to children. However, the improvement of children's food, clothing, housing, and transportation, the rescue of orphans and wanderers, the education of the disabled and mentally retarded, and the perfection of infant care institutions may not have been fixed by laws and regulations that can be used as a basis, or even if there are regulations, there are still many omissions. Planning and supplementation cannot be delayed. Now, in order to increase children's happiness and consolidate the foundation of national survival, we hereby announce to the country that those who have laws and regulations to rely on but have not been able to implement them should be led by various organs to lead their subordinates, guide the people, and strictly comply. Those that have not yet been regulated or have omissions should be promptly added and submitted for approval by the relevant organs during the Children's Year. In addition, compulsory education has begun this year, and this matter is of utmost importance to the well-being of children. At present, disasters are frequent in various places, and the number of children who are displaced and in need of relief is not small. Special attention should be paid to the above two points, and no negligence should be allowed. This matter concerns the happiness of children and the future of the nation. In addition to issuing orders, we are issuing orders to obey, forward to your subordinates, and announce to the people to comply with the order together. This is most important. This order, etc.' Upon receiving this order, in addition to issuing orders, we are issuing orders for your bureau to obey. This order, etc.' Upon receiving this order, in addition to issuing orders, we should send a letter to your association for your review and to inform your subordinates to comply with the order together, etc.' We are corresponding to forward this in the hope that you will review it, etc."</p>

<h3>The Match Industry Federation Sends a Letter to the City Chamber of Commerce, Detailing Its Opinions on the New Stamp Duty Law, Considering That There Are Discrepancies with Legal Intent and Omissions, Requesting Further Discussion and Submission to the Ministry of Finance for Revision and Supplementation</h3>
<p>The new Stamp Duty Law and its Implementing Rules have been promulgated by the National Government and came into effect on September 1st. The China National Match Industry Federation of this city believes that there are still two points in the provisions of the law that are worth discussing, and has specially sent a letter to the City Chamber of Commerce, requesting further research and submission to the Ministry of Finance for revision. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>Officially Promulgated</p>
<p>Respectfully stated, the "Stamp Duty Law" and its "Implementing Rules" have been implemented by the government since September 1st. We would like to present our views on the points that can be discussed, as far as we can see. Article 3 of the Stamp Duty Law lists various documents that are exempt from stamp duty, and Item 8 stipulates, "All documents used internally by public or private organs or organizations that do not generate external rights and obligations." This means that these documents can be exempted from stamp duty as long as they are used internally by the organ or organization and do not generate external relations. The organ or organization is clearly regarded as a whole system, without any distinction between the head office and branch offices, and without any distinction between mutual use between the head office and branch offices. Whether interpreted from the text or spirit of the law, there is no doubt about this. However, the latter part of Article 4 of the Implementing Rules states that "mutual use between the second-level organ and the head office, or between the branch organization and the head organization, shall not be regarded as internal use," which actually distorts the entire system that is clearly recognized by the law, forcibly divides it, and says that "documents used internally and not generating external rights and obligations" shall not be regarded as internal use." Not only does this</p>
<p>Clearly Violate Legal Intent</p>
<p>It is also close to arbitrariness. This association is a match industry group. Although it is impossible to know the contents of other public or private organs or organizations in detail, as far as match companies are concerned, they generally set up a head office in a place with convenient transportation for centralized management, and set up branch offices and factories in other suitable locations to undertake the responsibilities of sub-management and manufacturing. All work allocation and operating profits and losses are handled by the head office, which bears full responsibility. This is because the company is a legal person, its personality is conferred by law, and its rights and obligations are similar to those of natural persons. Therefore, the separate establishment of its head office, branch offices, and factories is like the separate forms of the head and limbs of a natural person. Although there are distinctions on the surface, they are actually an integral whole and cannot be separated for a moment, let alone forcibly split. Therefore, the documents mutually notified between the head office, branch offices, and factories are completely an entire act and cannot be divided into a branch organ and a head office, or a branch organization and a head organization. The stamps affixed to the documents and securities issued by them are the same as the legal principle of Article 8 of the same article. The Implementing Rules regard the provisions that legal persons should have in Article 4 of the first item of this law as something that has not been</p>
<p>Explained in Any Way</p>
<p>For Article 8, it even forcibly interprets it as a branch organ and a head organ, or a branch organization and a head organization, saying that "the documents used internally and not generating external rights and obligations shall not be regarded as internal use." In terms of legal principles, it is self-contradictory. This Implementing Rule should be carefully revised. Article 16, Item 4 of the Stamp Duty Law stipulates that the work ledger used by workers in various industries to withdraw wages is exempt from stamp duty, and Article 27 of the same article stipulates that the employment guarantee is also exempt from stamp duty. Because workers have a difficult life, their work ledgers and guarantees, which they rely on to withdraw wages, are specially exempted from tax to show consideration. The law is well-intentioned and deeply admirable. However, whether a worker's employment contract should be</p>
<p>Exempt from Stamp Duty</p>
<p>Although the law does not have explicit provisions, it seems that it should also be included in the exemption list according to the above exemption rules. The Implementing Rules should deeply embody the legal intent and add explanations and supplements. However, after reading the provisions of the Implementing Rules, I did not pay attention to this, which seems to be a failure to thoroughly implement the legal intent of caring for workers, which is regrettable. This Implementing Rule should be carefully supplemented. I think that the law should be observed, and research should be pursued in detail. The two points mentioned above seem to have room for research. Your association is a leader in the business community, and you have a proven record of research on the Stamp Duty Law. I dare not refuse to express my humble opinions and have explained them in detail in separate letters. I hope you will discuss them and, if you agree, forward them to the Ministry of Finance and make appropriate revisions and supplements to the above-mentioned discrepancies and omissions in the Implementing Rules that are inconsistent with the legal intent. I am most grateful to the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce and the China National Match Industry Federation."</p>
<h3>Chen Zehua Appointed Secretary of the Embassy in Germany; Will Set Sail with Ambassador Cheng at the Beginning of Next Month</h3>
<p>Mr. Chen Zehua, the chief writer for the Morning Post, has served as a professor at the National Shanghai College of Commerce and Jinan University. His speeches and demeanor are highly regarded. It is now heard that Mr. Chen will go to Germany with Ambassador Cheng Tianfang at the beginning of next month to serve as the secretary of the embassy. The letter of appointment from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will be issued within days.</p>
<h3>The Sino-French Profit-Sharing Relief Effort Is About to Expire</h3>
<p>The Sino-French Pharmacy has been holding a large-scale, profit-sharing relief sale for 30 days since the 10th of last month. Sales of seasonal medicines, such as Dragon and Tiger Brand Ren Dan, China Bao Dan, Emergency Epidemic Medicine Water, Seven Star Camphor, and Zi Lan Di Jiu, have increased several times compared to usual. The period of the large-scale sale is coming to an end in a few days. Charity enthusiasts should not miss it.</p>
<h3>The Theft of Rickshaws in Nanshi Flaring Up Again</h3>
<p>Since the Nanshi rickshaw theft and ransom cases were addressed by the Rickshaw Pullers Trade Association organizing a "No Ransom Group," and the Municipal Public Security Bureau earnestly investigated and apprehended notorious offenders like Xiao Su San, Han Tuozi, and Xiao Heizi, handing them over to the local court, and the French Concession Police also captured Wang Degui, Xu San Xiazi, and Xiao Fuzi, rickshaw theft cases in the Nanshi area had gradually decreased and almost disappeared. Previously, when a rickshaw puller had his cart stolen, he had to seek help from various sources and be familiar with the procedures, costing him at least fifteen or sixteen yuan to get compensated. If the rickshaw was lost without a trace, the loss was unimaginable. Thanks to the Association's relief efforts, the compensation for a stolen rickshaw was only six yuan, and if the cart was recovered, three yuan would be refunded. Therefore, the rickshaw pullers were deeply grateful. However, recently, the ringleaders of these rickshaw thefts, who have been living off this unexpected income for many years, are unwilling to change to other professions. Besides sending their accomplices to steal rickshaws in the Zhabei, Hongqiao, and Anglo-French Concessions to hold them for ransom, they are also taking advantage of the night to operate in various rickshaw depots in Nanshi. When no one is there to negotiate a ransom, they strip the carts of their tires and leave them on the road. The rickshaw depots have appealed to the Association for relief. The Association, considering that the "No Ransom Group" was established for rickshaw pullers whose carts were stolen outside, only agreed to submit a request to the authorities for investigation and also issued leaflets urging each rickshaw depot to be careful to avoid inadvertently encouraging theft. Therefore, each rickshaw depot is mutually vigilant at night. Ringleaders such as Lu A Si, Zhao Xiao Sizi, and Liu Cheng Song are very active, hoping to undermine the "No Ransom Group" organization. It is deeply hoped that the municipal authorities will pay close attention.</p>
<h3>Western Servant Demands Wages, Accused of Murder by Employer, Witness Proves Defendant Not Seen with Knife, Bail Approved for Defendant on the 11th</h3>
<p>Huang Ji Hai, from Wuhu, was a Western servant at the home of a German doctor, Dr. Fox (transliterated), at 810 Route Petain in the French Concession. After being dismissed on the 22nd of last month, he went to the employer at about 7 PM that afternoon to settle his wages, which he did not receive. He was then injured in the head by a meat cleaver thrown at him, causing bleeding. He was also knocked to the ground and beaten, and his right arm was scalded with boiling water. He escaped and reported to the police station and was sent to the hospital for treatment. Instead, Fox reported to the police station that Huang had attempted to kill him with a knife and requested an investigation. Thereupon, the police station transferred Huang to the Second Special Court, filed a public prosecution, and detained him. Details have already been published in this newspaper. Yesterday, Judge Wang Xu Chang of the Second Special Court revisited the case in the Criminal Division. According to Huang's statement, he first demanded wages that day and was pushed out the door. When he went in a second time, he was injured in the head, causing bleeding. After being knocked to the ground and brutally beaten, his arm was scalded with boiling water. With both hands held, how could he have held a knife to kill his employer? He didn't know where the knife came from and requested a thorough investigation. The rest of his statement was the same as previously reported. His monthly salary was twenty yuan, and he was due for payment on the 22nd. He requested a settlement, etc. According to the translated statement of the plaintiff, Fox, "He (referring to Huang) came to demand wages, so I ordered someone to go out to exchange foreign dollars because he looked very fierce when he came. Therefore, I pushed him out the door. The second time he came in, I saw he was about to hit me, so I held both his hands. I saw a knife behind him fall to the ground. I never hit him," etc. At this point, the court considered the facts to be clear and ordered the commencement of arguments. First, Attorney Fei Xizhen of the Police Department argued, stating that the Police Department based its prosecution on the plaintiff's accusation and prosecuted for attempted murder. However, the witnesses testified that they did not see the defendant with a knife, nor did they prove that the defendant had any murderous behavior. The charge of attempted murder cannot be sustained. He requested that the court judge the case according to law. The defendant, represented by Attorney Gu Jirong, defended based on the facts, the law, and the testimonies of the witnesses and the defendant. The court adjourned the proceedings and scheduled the verdict for the 11th. The defendant was ordered to post a bail of one thousand yuan and a shop guarantee to appear whenever summoned. After repeated requests from the defendant's attorney to reduce the amount, the judge granted permission. The defendant changed to posting a bail of four hundred yuan with a shop guarantee to await further instructions.</p>
<h3>Ye Zhongfang Beats Guards in Detention Center Over Congee and Vegetables</h3>
<p>Ye Zhongfang, nicknamed Xiao Dou Luan, from Ningbo, was sued for divorce and alimony of 60,000 yuan by his wife in the Second Special Court. After three trials, the case concluded, and the sentence was to be enforced. Because Ye resisted and did not appear, and because his assets were exhausted and he could not pay, the Second Special Court detained Ye in mid-June for compulsory enforcement. Even after being detained in the detention center, Ye did not change his nature. On the morning of the 23rd of last month, at about 7 AM, he demanded porridge and vegetables from guard Shi Zemin. Dissatisfied that the soybeans were too hard and unable to exchange them, he started an argument and then resorted to violence, beating Shi. After being stopped by the guards, Shi reported to the warden, who transferred Ye to the Procuratorate of the Special Court for investigation. Prosecutor Wang Ren opened the court for investigation twice, as reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that Prosecutor Wang had opened the court twice, summoned witnesses Chen Zhonglian and Guo Rongji, and questioned the defendant, etc. Guard Shi Zemin also testified in detail. Because Ye was suspected of violating Article 153, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code, obstructing public duties, a public prosecution has been filed in accordance with the law with the Criminal Division of the same court, and a trial will be held soon.</p>

<h3>National Diocesan Congress of the Chinese Catholic Action Society Held, Approximately 200 Representatives Attending for One Week Starting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The first National Diocesan Congress of the Chinese Catholic Action Society is scheduled to open tomorrow morning (the 8th) in the hall of Gongjin Middle School, located near the St. Joseph's Hospital on Guohuo Road in Nanshi.

<p>Organization Process</p>
<p>The Chinese Catholic Action Society was initiated by Catholics in the North 25 years ago. Twenty-three years ago, Lu Bohong, the current General Manager of the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Electric Company, started organizing and promoting it. It is a group of purely Chinese Catholics outside the Catholic clergy and laity mixed organizations. The members of the Society, feeling the peril of the nation and the suffering of the people, love their motherland, which is also one of the tenets of Catholicism. They want to use the collective strength of the 3 million Catholics in China to affirm their will. On the one hand, they want to reform the past attitude of self-cultivation in isolation; on the other hand, they want to lay the foundation for the future, so as to benefit the nation and the people and promote Christian doctrines. That is why this Society was convened. The topics for discussion are nothing more than charity, society, education, and evangelization.</p>

<h3>Two Right Feet Found at the Entrance of Ciyunfang, Wangzhi Road, Examination Reveals They Are Amputated and Preserved Specimens, Police Order Investigation to Find the Person Who Abandoned Them</h3>
<p>At 0:20 PM the day before yesterday, two abandoned human feet, one fetus, and one piece of muscle were discovered at the side of a urinal near a trash can at the entrance of Ciyunfang Lane, No. 222 Wangzhi Road in the French Concession. The discovery caused a commotion, and many people gathered to watch. A patrolman reported the discovery to the Xiafei Road police station, which dispatched detectives to investigate. At the same time, the feet, fetus, etc., were transported to the autopsy room of the Tongren Fuyuan Branch for examination. Details have already been published in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that one of the feet seemed to have been amputated due to bullet wounds sustained in battle, while the other seemed to have been amputated due to illness. The fetus appeared to be from a five- or six-month-old miscarriage, and the piece of muscle was a leg muscle that had been cut off due to illness and was not from the buttocks or anus. Yesterday morning, the police station reported to the Second Special Court Procuratorate, which appointed Prosecutor Wang Ren to visit the scene with coroner Jiang and clerk Peng at noon. After a clear examination, it was determined that they were specimens that had been cut off, made into specimens, and then abandoned. After the examination was completed, the case was filed. According to the investigating detective Zhang Chunsheng's report on the investigation, the official instructed that it was determined that the two human right feet (one of which was amputated due to injury) were all specimens that had been sawed off and preserved. The fetus (approximately five or six months old) and a piece of thigh meat were also abandoned specimens and were handed over to Tongren Fuyuan Hall for burial. The case of the abandonment of the corpse will be handled by the police. After the examination, the Tongren Fuyuan Branch instructed the workers to put the two feet and thigh meat together in a small coffin and the fetus in another small coffin and carry them to the cemetery for burial. It is also said that about half an hour before the discovery, a seven- or eight-year-old child saw a man holding a paper package, going to the entrance of Ciyunfang Lane, and throwing it into the trash can. At that time, the child wanted to pick it up and open it, but the man immediately stopped him and said that there was a dead child inside and it was not to be opened and looked at. Then, he gave the child a few copper coins and waved him away. Later, the child did not walk far and saw the man go away. He invited a few children to pick up the paper package, opened it, and saw that it was a human foot and a dead child. He was greatly shocked and threw it on the ground and fled, causing passersby to gather and spread the news far and wide. The police station is now fully dispatching detectives to investigate and arrest the person who abandoned them for interrogation.</p>
<h3>14th Lottery Aviation Ticket Drawing Yesterday, First Prize Is Number 151594, Sold in Small Strips by Lao Dali Yuan in Old North Gate</h3>
<p>The 14th National Government Aviation Highway Construction Lottery drawing was held at 2 PM yesterday in the Yiyuan Garden on Route Albert in the French Concession. No fewer than 3,000 citizens went to watch. Prior to the event, the lottery office specially contracted with Chinese, Buddhist, American-Chinese, Qikai, Jianhua, and Nuojia wireless radio stations to announce the results in Chinese, English, French, and Russian languages as they were drawn. Therefore, the results of the drawing could be heard immediately by those who had wireless radios installed, both in and out of the city, which was very convenient for ticket buyers. The layout of the drawing venue was the same as in the previous period. Around 1 PM, Director Chen Hong, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Gui Yanfang, Dong Xian Guang, and representatives from all walks of life arrived at the scene one after another to inspect the lottery balls. Wang Xiaolai then announced that the procedures were complete and that the drawing time had arrived. The drawing was conducted in accordance with the regulations. Director Chen Hong then translated into English and began the drawing. The first ball drawn was 184002 for the third prize. The second ball was 195918 for the second prize. The second, third, and fourth prizes were then drawn in succession. The first prize, 151594, was drawn at 3 PM. It was distributed in small strips by Lao Dali Yuan on Old North Gate in Nanshi of this city. Therefore, the winner may be in this city. The remaining second and third prize numbers are 061177, 150255, and 094949. The prize money will be paid by the Central, China, and Communications Banks in various places starting from the 14th of this month and is valid for six months until February 29, 1936. Prize money not claimed after the deadline will be forfeited.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Discusses Rickshaw Puller Issues</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council held its first meeting after the autumn break the other day. The most important topic discussed that day was the issue of rickshaw pullers. The content of this issue is very complex and of great concern to the general public. On that day, Chairman Massey of the Vehicle Committee first presented a report. According to the report, as of July 31, the number of rickshaw pullers who had already obtained licenses was 37,135. The total number of registered rickshaw pullers in mid-August was 41,909. It is also planned to continue to handle the registration and licensing, and it is expected that the number of licensed rickshaw pullers will reach 42,000 by the end of October. Those who fail the inspection will also reach 1,100 or 1,200. (The previous report of 12,000 was a typo.) In this way, those who are already engaged in pulling rickshaws can have the opportunity to obtain a license to make a living. It is heard that the Municipal Council has expressed its approval of this proposal.</p>
<h3>Lake Society Paints Alerting Pictures, Distributes to Six Counties for Posting to Avoid Women Being Deceived</h3>
<p>The six counties of the Lake District are areas of wealth in western Zhejiang. The soil is fertile and the products are abundant. Silk is a major product. Rural life has always been stable. However, in recent years, there have been successive droughts and floods, and there has been no peaceful year. The price of silk has also fallen drastically, leading to rural bankruptcy and economic hardship. Some intellectually weak rural women are not content with staying at home, and cunning vagrants take this opportunity to visit and, using the excuse of finding work, deceive them to come to the city, plotting to sell them and cause them to fall into other places. Previously, the Lake Society of this city printed and distributed vernacular exhortations to the counties and this trend subsided somewhat. Recently, it was heard that old habits have been revived. For the sake of a fundamental solution, the Society specially asked famous artists to paint various warning pictures of the various tragic situations suffered by deceived women, printed them in three-color plates, and distributed them to the townships and towns of the six counties for posting, in order to educate the public and prevent rural women from being deceived and going astray.</p>

<h3>Peach Garden Lane: The Internal Workings of the "Red Pill" Scheme; The Profound Involvement of a Woman Named Pang; Willing to Pay a Thousand Taels to Bribe Police</h3>
<p>Upstairs in a carpenter's shop at No. 163 Peach Garden Lane, North Jiangxi Road, someone was secretly manufacturing a machinery for making drug pills. Around 5:00 AM on the 29th of last month, a man from Taizhou named Luo Zhaoxiu suddenly jumped from the building, attempting to escape. He injured his buttocks and was unable to stand. Tang Fuxiang, a carpenter's apprentice, saw him and reported it to Detective No. 1894, who arrived and took him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Fortunately, the injuries were minor, and he recovered within a few hours. Subsequently, he and the landlord, Zhu Mao, went upstairs and confiscated a large leather suitcase containing the raw materials for making the drug pills: morphine, caffeine, saccharin, resin, white powder, etc., totaling 26 different ingredients. They also apprehended two people: Madam Pang Li from Hangzhou and Yang Renchu from Guangdong. Together with a large quantity of the manufactured "red pills," they were taken to the Hongkou Police Station and sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi opened the Third Criminal Court for examination. The Municipal Council solicitor, Li Zhishan, stated that during the adjournment, the defendant, Madam Pang Li, claimed she was looking for a job at a job broker in a small vegetable market on Avenue Road, but had not found one, and was just lingering on the floor above the workshop. Her statement was unreliable. When arrested, she offered Detective No. 1894 one thousand yuan to be released, but was refused. Furthermore, the landlord, Zhu Mao, had been sending people to collect rent for the past two months, and Madam Pang had been paying it, but did not allow anyone to enter the room. At the time, the reason Luo Zhaoxiu jumped from the building was that he had been instructed by the main suspect, surnamed Zhang, to Yang Renchu to be careful, as competitors in the French Concession had discovered the location of the workshop. They were jealous and wanted to create trouble. At that time, many people came to the building to investigate, and Yang Renchu escaped via the roof and fled through a neighboring house. Luo Zhaoxiu, in desperation, jumped from the window and was injured. Madam Pang was out at the time. This was the summary of the investigation. When questioned, Madam Pang Li, looking ill, claimed to be suffering from typhoid fever and had nothing to do with the manufacturing of the red pills. Her testimony was extremely evasive. Solicitor Li said that she was heavily addicted to opium and "yue" pills, making her appearance gaunt. Since being detained, she had been unable to indulge. The typhoid fever was likely a fabrication. The defendant, Yang Renchu, testified that the owners of the workshop were two people surnamed Zhang who were on the run, and only came two or three times a week. He claimed to be just a worker. Luo Zhaoxiu testified that he was introduced to the place by his brother, initially as a cook, and then replaced Yang Renchu and the two Zhangs in helping to manufacture the "red pills." Judge Jiang ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody separately and scheduled sentencing.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Industrial Bank: Embezzlement by Employee Concluded; Sentencing Scheduled for the 13th</h3>
<p>The case of embezzlement by Wang Liangjie, an employee of Zhejiang Industrial Bank, was heard again yesterday morning. Presiding Judge Feng Shide of the First Special District Court took his seat in the First Court. The police lawyer presented the results of the investigation during the adjournment and stated that the previous claim of an additional deposit of 2,800 yuan in the Chunji account involving collusion with the chief officers was incorrect. Judge Feng questioned the defendant about the embezzlement. The defendant's testimony was evasive, only stating that the embezzlement was true because of high family expenses and many requests for loans from relatives and friends. He therefore resorted to this tactic and requested leniency. Subsequently, the agent of Zhejiang Industrial Bank requested an incidental civil suit, ordering the defendant to repay 41,155.17 yuan. However, they stated that after the defendant was handed over to the police, the defendant's friend returned a loan of over 10,000 yuan, part of which had been deposited with the police. The actual amount the plaintiff sought to recover in the incidental civil suit should be 31,282.07 yuan. Judge Feng instructed the defendant's defense lawyer to provide a lawful defense. He then ordered sentencing on the 13th of this month and adjourned the court.</p>
<h3>Ruan Kaiji Case Concluded; Sentencing Scheduled for the 11th of This Month</h3>
<p>The case in which Madam Tu Xu sued Mei Weiyu, who ran the Jiang Xiangxing slaughterhouse, and Ruan Kaiji, head of the Xin Zha sub-bureau, for restricting her freedom, etc., has been heard repeatedly by the Criminal Court of the District Court without resolution. Details have been previously reported. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Judge Tan Zhuohong specially opened the Eleventh Court for continued hearing. The plaintiff, along with lawyer Lu Qi, appeared in court and presented the previous facts. The defendant, Jiang Weiyu, hired lawyers Zhang Fukang and Huang Qiying to defend him. According to Ruan Kaiji's testimony, the Tu Xu case was investigated by police officer Ouyang. Tu Xu should have been released, but the plaintiff, Jiang Weiyu, requested that her husband, Tu Axiang, be related to the strike case. As for the handcuffs, it was the general practice of the headquarters, and all defendants had to be handcuffed. According to Jiang Weiyu's testimony, Tu Axiang and Tu Xu voluntarily went to the bureau to explain the matter. Ouyang Liu testified that on that day, Tu Xu was questioned and ordered to sign a bond for release. Because the plaintiff requested that she be sent to headquarters, she was transferred to headquarters the next day for handling. At this point, lawyer Lu Qi stated that the main culprit was Ouyang alone, and Ruan Kaiji was suffering for someone else's fault. Ouyang replied, "I ordered her to leave." Tu Xu said to Ouyang, "What business is it of yours to confine me for a night? If you told me to leave, I wouldn't leave. There's no such idiot in the world." The judge questioned the two police officers and then ordered the start of the debate. Lawyers Zhang and Huang gave lengthy and eloquent arguments. The judge stated that the case was clear and concluded the debate, scheduling sentencing for the 12th.</p>
<h3>Xie Jingjiang Attempts to Murder His Wife; Wife Sues for Divorce; Forced into Prostitution by an Anmo Girl; Ye Xiangru's Plight is Also Pitiful</h3>
<p>In the Lidu Anmo Parlor at the intersection of Sichuan Road and Old Barracks Road, there is an anmo girl named Ye Xiangru (also known as Aidi) from Nanjing, who is 21 years old. In 1929, when Xiangru was 15 years old, she was married to Xie Jingjiang from Ningbo through a matchmaker named Zhang. The couple's relationship was harmonious. Xie worked as a servant for a foreigner, but was dismissed for poor performance. After losing his job, he had difficulty maintaining his livelihood and repeatedly borrowed money from his wife, which was refused. Last month, Xie rushed to the anmo parlor and tricked his wife out the door. He pulled out a sharp knife and tried to kill Xiangru. The owner of the parlor, Mr. Chen, saw it and immediately stepped forward to dissuade him. Xiangru reported it to the Central Police Station. After questioning, the head detective determined that it was a common dispute between husband and wife and refused to handle it. At this point, Xiangru had no choice but to hire a lawyer and file a lawsuit with the First Special District Court for divorce. Yesterday morning, Judge Mo Runhua specially opened the civil court for hearing. The plaintiff, Ye Xiangru, along with her attorney, appeared in court. The defendant was absent. The plaintiff testified that she married the defendant at the age of fifteen and held a formal wedding at the Zuile Village Restaurant on Wusong Road, renting a house at No. 315 Xin Xin Li, Dapei Bridge, Rue du Pere Robert in the French Concession. It has been seven years since then, and they have one child. Working in an anmo parlor is a last resort, forced by the defendant. She also stated that she had received a considerable education and disregarded her honor due to the pressure of making a living. Judge Mo adjourned the case due to the defendant's absence and scheduled a hearing for testimony.</p>
<h3>Lu Wenzhong Sues Women's Bank; Erroneous Legal Citations; Amended Complaint; Rescheduled Hearing</h3>
<p>Because of past deposit transactions between the Women's Bank and the United Trading Company's Lu Wenzhong, a checkbook was provided to Lu, so that Lu could use the checks to access funds. Recently, however, the bank has been returning Lu's signed checks. The reason for refusing payment was merely to write "Please contact the drawer" on the returned checks. However, Lu audited his accounts with the bank and found that he still had a balance, which should not be refused. This caused damage to his external reputation. He sent a letter to the bank asking for an explanation and requesting a statement. Later, he learned that the bank claimed that although there were still funds in his current account, there were arrears in other accounts, and that after offsetting the two, there was still a shortage. Therefore, the checks were stopped. However, Lu believed that the bank's action of "planting flowers and grafting trees" was inappropriate. He hired a lawyer Liu Lun to file a criminal complaint against the chairman of the bank, Yao Muhua, and others, requesting that they be punished for breach of trust. The First Special District Court accepted the complaint, noting that the legal provisions cited by the plaintiff were not entirely appropriate for the matter. Therefore, in the afternoon, Judge Pan Fen held a hearing and summoned the plaintiff to court, informing him that the bank's refusal to honor the checks was a civil dispute and did not constitute a crime of breach of trust. He explained the elements of a crime of breach of trust in detail. Finally, he told him that if he wanted to sue, the legal provisions would have to be amended. The plaintiff's lawyer, upon hearing this, said that he would discuss the amendment of the legal provisions with his client and then amend the complaint. The court then granted an adjournment for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Notice: Rickshaw Pullers Must Display Armbands for Inspection Within a Time Limit; Unregistered Pullers Are Not Allowed to Pull</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Public Concession is handling the registration of rickshaw pullers. After the deadline of the 15th of last month, yesterday's notice stated that all registered rickshaw pullers must display their armbands from the 15th of this month. Those who have not registered will be banned from pulling. The notice reads: "Notice: As of September 15th of this year, all rickshaw pullers who do not have a public rickshaw license or are not registered will not be allowed to pull public rickshaws. Rickshaw pullers must wear their enamel armbands on their left arm in a clearly visible place. Their registration certificate must be presented upon request. This notice is hereby given. September 5, 1935, Acting Director-General F. Feilipu."</p>
<h3>United Rent Reduction Association of Various Districts: Notice to Branch Associations in Various Districts; Beware of People Using the Name to Collect Fees Under False Pretenses</h3>
<p>The Shanghai United Rent Reduction Association of Various Districts, because the city-wide association has virtually ceased, only the First Special District Association has taken its place. However, the work outside the Special District is not widespread enough. Furthermore, with the market declining daily, rent reduction is becoming increasingly urgent. Therefore, the rent reduction associations of various districts in the city have formed the Shanghai United Rent Reduction Association of Various Districts, actively planning, cooperating, and dividing labor, with the goal of achieving universal rent reduction as soon as possible. It has recently been heard that there are unscrupulous people using the name of the General Rent Reduction Association, deceiving and confusing people, and collecting fees everywhere, undermining the people's movement. Inevitably, there may be other intentions. The United Association has issued an urgent notice to branch associations in various districts to pay attention, and sent letters to police stations and concessions to strictly investigate. The original letter is as follows: "To Whom It May Concern: The Rent Reduction Association was originally organized out of necessity due to social environmental conditions, in order to alleviate the livelihood of ordinary people. This kind of people's movement is extremely important. However, all the expenses of the association are borne by the district associations, and no fees are collected from the outside. This has already been published in the newspaper. It has recently been heard that hundreds of people are using the name of the general association to deceive and confuse people, collecting fees everywhere under false pretenses, which is tantamount to fraud and is greatly inconsistent with the original purpose of rent reduction. It is obviously intended to undermine the legitimate people's movement, so it is impossible to remain silent. In addition to sending letters to branch associations in various districts to notify all tenants, if they encounter the above situation, they should immediately investigate. We are writing to you to request that you send personnel to investigate as soon as possible to prevent illegal activities. Sincerely, etc."</p>

<h3>Autumn Rains Reduce Agricultural Harvests</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of autumn, the weather has been hot and humid, and the continuous cloudy and rainy days, although sometimes sunny, have caused the rice crops planted in the fields in the four villages to suffer from too much rain. Currently, they are in the process of bearing fruit, and the cotton planted in the low-lying fields has been damaged, with the leaves turning yellow and the cotton bells falling off. This year's cotton harvest is expected to be reduced. However, the rice crops are still largely unaffected. However, at around 10:00 AM yesterday, there was a light rain for an hour, followed by a large clearing and the red sun in the sky. After 2:00 PM, dark clouds gathered again and there was a heavy rainstorm with thunder. It finally cleared up at around 3:00 PM. According to the old farmers, this year's cotton harvest has been greatly reduced due to the heavy rainfall, which has caused the plants to wither and fall off.</p>
<h3>Study of Public Bus Crushing a Boy to Death</h3>
<p>Cai Chang, the seven-year-old son of Cantonese woman Li Ding, who resides at No. 284 Fair Road, was attempting to cross the road from north to south near Fair Road on East Seward Road at around 3:00 PM on the afternoon before yesterday, when Public Bus No. 15022, driven by Li Jinchizhi, sped from the west. The driver was unable to brake in time, and the right front wheel knocked the boy down and crushed him severely. The police immediately recorded the number of the bus and summoned an ambulance to rush the boy to Tongren Hospital, but the treatment was ineffective and he soon died. Li Zhaogen and other detectives from the Huishan Police Station were dispatched to investigate and transported the body to the Forensic Examination Office on Fellen Road. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court was reported to have sent prosecutor Guo Wei and others to the office to examine the body. First, Hua Detective Shen Baoshan reported the previous situation, and then witness Ge Xuda (transliteration), a Russian residing at No. 468 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, testified that he was sitting in the bus on that day. The car had just left Fair Road Station when he suddenly heard a loud braking sound. He looked out the window and saw that the deceased had been knocked down, head south and feet north. He did not see how he was hit. Li Jinchizhi, 21 years old, from Shandong, who has been driving for three and a half years, testified that when he had just started the bus from Fair Road Station, he saw a dilapidated car in front of him, traveling in the same direction. He wanted to let the car pass, so he turned south. Unexpectedly, the child suddenly ran out from in front of the dilapidated car, causing him to be unable to brake in time and knocking him down. After hearing the testimony, Mr. Guo declared that the deceased boy, Li Caichang, had been crushed to death by Public Bus No. 15022 before his death. The body was handed over to his mother, Li Ding, who received it and returned to prepare for the funeral. Mr. Guo then instructed the police that public bus accidents were frequent and that they must pay attention to prevention at all times. He also ordered the driver to be careful in the future and not to cause accidents.</p>
<h3>Zhang Diaomei Sues Li Chuanhong, the "Old Madam," for Restricting Freedom; Seizing Adopted Son and Not Allowing Him to Return Home</h3>
<p>Zhang Diaomei, a native of the city and the Chinese manager of the Yufeng Foreign Firm on Jiangxi Road, now 53 years old, recently hired lawyer Ling Baihong to file a criminal complaint with the First Special Court against Li Chuanhong, the "Old Madam" (i.e., the former concubine of Navy Commander Lin Baozhi, also known as a former prostitute, surnamed Geng), for restricting freedom. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Zehan opened the Eighth Criminal Court for interrogation. The defendant, Li Chuanhong, the "Old Madam," did not arrive. The plaintiff, Zhang Diaomei, filed a case and testified that he lives at No. 54 Guling Road. I have three brothers. My eldest brother, Xixiang, has two sons. My second brother, Yuruo, is deceased and has two sons, Yiliang and Yixian. I am the third brother. Because I have no son, I adopted Yuruo's second son, Yixian (19 years old this year), as my heir. He was given to me to raise when he was one month old, but Yixian is also Yuruo's legitimate son. Because my deceased brother had many concubines during his lifetime, the defendant, Li Chuanhong, was a prostitute in a brothel and was taken as the second concubine by my deceased brother. At the same time, there were three girls, Dayuan, Eryuan, and Sanyuan. My deceased brother Yuruo also took Dayuan as a concubine, who then gave birth to Yixian, named Baozhi, with the nickname Jisheng. Later, Yuruo died in the autumn of 1918, and the defendant remarried to former Navy Commander Lin Bao, who was old and had no children. The defendant then had bad intentions. Initially, she always took Yixian to the Lin residence to play, claiming to miss him, and he would spend the night and return. They visited each other frequently. Last year, I moved to Pudong, and in May of last year, after moving back to Shanghai, they stopped coming. Although I have repeatedly gone to negotiate, the defendant has been avoiding me, actually seizing my adopted son, Yixian. Therefore, I have come to file a complaint. It has been confirmed that the defendant lives at No. 74 Tongfu Road, living with her son-in-law, lawyer Zhu Yuan, in the same place. Now, she is deliberately refusing to appear. Then, several photos taken at the time were submitted. Judge Wu ordered the case to be adjourned to the afternoon of the 16th, pending a report from the messenger before the case is heard again.</p>
<h3>Inducing a Woman to Lewdness, Sentenced to Four Years</h3>
<p>Wang Shifu, a local resident living in a bungalow on Yulin Road, had a daughter named Genda, seventeen years old. She worked at the Shenxin No. 7 Factory and was somewhat attractive. On the morning of the 23rd of last month, around 3 a.m., she was lured by Shen Jikang, a fellow villager aged twenty-one, to the Continental Hotel at No. 12 Gongyuli, Huade Road, where they opened a room to stay. The incident was discovered by her father, who reported it to the Yulin Road Police Station. Detective Jin Wanrong was secretly dispatched to arrest Shen, and he was sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi presided over the court and sentenced Shen Jikang to four years of imprisonment. The number of days detained before the judgment is determined will be counted as two days for one day of imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Impersonating the Ningbo Tongshan Benevolent Society, Scamming Donations Exposed, Li Guangyu Ultimately Undecieved</h3>
<p>Gu Changsheng, a thirty-year-old man from Ningbo, along with two fellow villagers, Wang Agen and Zhou (both at large), held a fake donation book forged in the name of the Ningbo Tongshan Benevolent Society. On the afternoon of the previous day, they went to the home of Li Guangyu, a fellow villager and fishmonger residing at No. 49 Caishi Street in the French Concession, and coerced Li into making a donation. Initially, Li refused, but Gu and the others took out the "Credit Record of the Siming Public Association" published in the 23rd year of the Republic and showed it to Li, saying, "You donated five yuan before, how can you refuse now? You should pay the same amount," and so on. Li was taken aback for a moment and, finding himself at a loss for words, agreed to donate five yuan. However, after writing in the donation book, Li remained suspicious. He pretended to ask Gu and the others to wait while he retrieved the money and secretly called the Siming Public Association to inquire about the matter. He then learned that Gu and the others were fraudulently soliciting donations. He stalled for time, and the Siming Public Association reported it to the French Concession Police. When detectives arrived at Li's home, Wang Agen and Zhou, being alert, saw that their scheme had been exposed and seized the opportunity to escape. The detectives only managed to arrest Gu and brought him and the donation book to the police station. Yesterday, Gu Shouxi, a lawyer from the Criminal Division No. 8 of the Second Special District Court's Police Affairs Department, stated that the defendant was arrested for fraud and forgery. As the police still needed to investigate and apprehend the accomplices at large, he requested a postponement. Subsequently, the plaintiff, Li Guangyu, recounted the defendant's extortion. When questioned, Gu confessed that Wang Agen, who was at large, hired him to solicit donations and he did not know the truth. Ding Wenyuan and Jin, accountants dispatched by the Siming Public Association, also testified that the Ningbo Tongshan Benevolent Society was originally located in Ningbo and had been dissolved in the 23rd year of the Republic. After Judge Chen Pusheng verified the testimony, he announced a postponement until the 13th for further questioning, and the defendant was remanded in custody.</p>

<h3>Li Wanchun Arrives in Shanghai to Perform</h3>
<p>Li Wanchun, a famous actor who has recently been extremely popular in the capital, is the son of the famous painted-face actor Li Yongli. His mastery of martial arts has reached the pinnacle of perfection, and his movements and postures all possess measure. Compared to the actors of the Shanghai school, there is a world of difference. His God-given voice is clear and bright, with a jade-like smoothness and roundness. Among the talents of today's theatrical world, he can be considered second to none. Furthermore, he possesses an elegant temperament and, apart from acting, enjoys painting flowers and plants, inheriting the legacy of Li Futang. He also occasionally writes regular script calligraphy with fluent skill, displaying well-honed artistry. Mr. Chu Minyi, a member of the Central Committee, even personally wrote the four characters "Da Ya Bu Qun" (The Greatly Elegant Are Not Commonplace) to present to him, which can be said to be appropriate and fitting. The Rongji Gongwu Stage on Edward Avenue in this city, admiring his great reputation, spared no expense in hiring him to come to Shanghai. Although Actor Li once performed in Shanghai as a child, earning great praise, it has been eight years since then. Having been away for so long, he greatly desires to take this opportunity to meet people from all walks of life on the red carpet and happily accepted the invitation. Yesterday (the 6th), he arrived in Shanghai from the capital at 2:00 PM on the 9:30 AM express train, accompanied by Mr. Zhou Jianxing, the stage manager of his theater. The staff of the Gongwu Stage and various box offices welcomed him. Amidst fluttering flags and the music of military bands, Actor Li and the members of the Yongli Theater Company emerged and shook hands with the welcomers one by one. Actor Li was wearing a white wool suit that day, displaying his heroic and extraordinary bearing. He then boarded his own car and sped to his residence. After resting for a few days, he will take the stage. His signature plays include "Lin Chong's Night Flight," "Qunyinghui" (Gathering of Heroes), and "Wu Song," all of which are masterpieces he is skilled at performing. The people of Shanghai will have a feast for the eyes.</p>

<h3>Valuing Reputation More Than Fearing the Law</h3>
<p>A materialistic society most enjoys spreading the bad names of people. For example, if someone occasionally smokes opium, those who know will broadcast it to the public. So-and-so smokes! He is already addicted! He has fallen from grace! Or, if someone is truly addicted, but only smokes three to five fen per day, the spreaders will exaggerate and say: So-and-so has to smoke dozens of yuan worth every day! His family fortune is exhausted! Even worse, there is someone who smokes because of illness, but only smokes a little in the morning and is very restrained. He is able to arrive at the office on time and does not delay any public affairs. However, the spreaders will say that he is extremely lazy and has abandoned everything. If someone wants to hire him for an important position, the masses will destroy and stop him, saying: So-and-so is lying in bed all day and has become a useless person. He is not capable of holding a position! If he, for this reason, resolves to quit, and never smokes again, then the neighbors and relatives will quietly say nothing. No one will be willing to spread the news that he has quit smoking. Alas! The morals and minds of the world are so shallow! They only like to publicize the faults of others and bury the good deeds of others. It is as if this is what is divided and appropriate. Those who suffer the injustice and pain of being slandered for smoking are countless. If someone is not extremely foolish and wicked, who would not cherish his reputation? Therefore, in persuading people to quit opium, it is appropriate to advise and punish each person's reputation and concept. Those who can quit, public opinion will reward them. And help wash away the past slander. Give them a way out in life. Those who are not absolutely forced to quit, the social masses abandon them. Disqualified from the upper class. Never have a job. Then people are all frightened by the bad name of smoking, and they are still lucky to regain their reputation after quitting. Is not necessarily through judicial punishment, fines, and will be able to inspire smokers to quit. Otherwise, some do not even know fear. If smokers are suppressed and humiliated too much, they do not know how to cultivate their sense of shame and cut off their hope of restoring their reputation. Then it must be more effective to persuade them with their name, instead of forcing them with punishments.</p>
<h3>Cellular Changes Phenomenon in Smokers</h3>
<p>— Tang Jiazhen</p>
<p>Observing the above diagram, it can be seen that the various cells of ordinary human bodies are all very peaceful and without any disease of excess or deficiency (Figure 1). After smoking opium, all cells are stimulated and increased. At this time, the mind and nerves are completely moved and reach a state of excitement (Figure 2). After smoking for a long time and becoming addicted, the cells are overstimulated and disappear. They cannot be invigorated without opium stimulation, and the cellular phenomenon becomes a blur. At the same time, symptoms such as lethargy, yawning, and runny nose occur (Figure 3). After smoking enough, the cells return, but the phenomenon is not natural, so the cells in various parts still have signs of excess or deficiency, resulting in various symptoms (Figure 4). After quitting, after supplementing and conditioning with egg yolk protein, it can be exactly the same as ordinary people (Figure 5).</p>

<h3>Research on the Origins and Development of Opium (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Jiannong</p>
<p>The era when opium was imported into China most vigorously was the seventh year of the Yongzheng reign of the Qing dynasty. At that time, the British shipped earth from Macau, importing about three thousand boxes per month. Each box contained forty tubes of earth. Each tube weighed a little over three catties. Each box weighed over one hundred and twenty catties. The boxes were made of foreign wooden boards and sealed with raw cattle hide. There were many kinds of earth. The best was called "Gongban". There was another kind called "Xiao Gongban", whose quality was even better than "Gongban". As a result, this kind of earth became a necessity for social interactions among the upper class. In addition, there were also "white earth" and "gold flower earth", which were similar to the current used earth pulp. At the time, they were not very popular. As opium was imported in such a steady stream and became a harmful habit, the toxicity gradually became apparent over time. As a result, there were measures to prohibit trafficking and smoking. The first ban on smoking opium was announced by the Qing government. It said that traffickers would be punished with the cangue and caning. Repeat offenders would be exiled to remote areas. However, those who smoked were treated as if they were sick and not treated as criminals. Therefore, there were many jokes at the time. General private traffickers often argued that what they were trafficking was medicinal material, not opium smoke, and were thus acquitted. The number of those who were acquitted was very large. The most ridiculous thing was that in the seventh year of the Yongzheng reign, Liu Shiming, the governor of Fujian, reported that Li Guozhi, the prefect of Zhangzhou, had obtained thirty-four catties of opium privately trafficked by the trade merchant Chen Yuan. It was proposed that he be punished with a military crime. When I proposed to personally question him, Chen Yuan confessed that opium was originally a medicinal material and was not the same thing as harmful opium smoke. I summoned the medicine merchants to identify and verify it. They all said that it was a medicinal material, a necessary product for treating dysentery, and could not harm people. Only when it was added to tobacco and cooked together did it become opium smoke. Li Zhiguo wrongly regarded opium as opium smoke, which was very absurd. He should be referred to the emperor in accordance with the precedents of the knowingly falsely accusing people.</p>
<p>The private trafficker's claim that "opium" was originally a medicinal material and not the same thing as harmful opium smoke was already ridiculous. However, Liu Shiming, the governor of Fujian, a high-ranking official, was actually deceived by a private trafficker's sophistry and publicly presented the contradictory language to the court. And the emperor, who was known as wise and enlightened, was also at a loss to understand the situation. It can be seen that although the import of opium was large at the time, only a small number of people smoked it. Its toxicity was far less than it is now. Therefore, there were still people who did not know what opium was, which led to the ridiculous statement that "opium and opium smoke are not the same thing".</p>
<p>Opium was repeatedly banned during the Qing dynasty. However, general treacherous merchants disobeyed and secretly trafficked as before. As a result, during the Qianlong reign, there was a second ban on opium. The ban was roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Domestic merchants who trafficked would be punished with the cangue for one month and one hundred strokes of the bamboo. They would be exiled to the border and serve as soldiers for three years. Officials and guards who committed the crime would be dismissed from office. They would be punished with the cangue for two months and one hundred strokes of the bamboo. They would be exiled two thousand miles away and enslaved.</p>
<p>Although this order once had some effect, it did not last long. The toxicity became even worse than before. As a result, at the beginning of the Jiaqing reign, the rulers made a great determination and resolutely banned it. They also abolished the opium tax. At that time, there were still cases of private trafficking and smuggling. Therefore, when foreign ships arrived in Guangdong, the trade merchants first had to issue a "certificate stating that the goods shipped to Huangpu did not contain opium" before they were allowed to open the hatches and inspect the goods. Those trade merchants who concealed and were found out would be punished more severely. However, the stricter the ban, the more secret trafficking there was. The toxicity also became more widespread. British merchants set up ships to store opium. There was an "opium dream".</p>
<p>They were anchored in the Lingding Island and Da Yu Shan areas of Guangzhou Bay. The ships that secretly trafficked opium even had armed fast crabs (the name of the ships carrying earth at the time). The shops that sold the opium were in Dayao Kou in Guangzhou. They also colluded everywhere with government clerks, runners, and patrolling sentries. Therefore, many officials and guards in coastal areas had private contracts that required them to pay a bribe for each box of opium that was imported. It can be said that they were the ancestors of the large companies and officials who protected the unloading of opium earth in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Notes from the Yumeiren Hall (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Dun Gen</p>
<p>Yanzi Ke (Swallow's Nest)</p>
<p>During the mid-Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, when opium was prevalent, opium dens were everywhere in Shanghai. These were commonly called 'smoke rooms'. They were generally large in scale and lavishly decorated, with secluded rooms and comprehensive facilities. Those who entered could sit, lie down, chat, laugh, call prostitutes, and drink wine—anything was possible. Furthermore, merchants competed to surround the guests and seek sales of jewelry, silks, paintings, calligraphy, and antiques. Guests would lie back and admire them with delight, unaware of the time of day outside. But after the Republic, as the opium ban became stricter, impoverished people risked breaking the law to sell lamp fuel privately. These were often located in cramped, dilapidated dwellings with makeshift beds. Opium smokers would huddle inside, appearing as pitiful as beggars. These places were then commonly called 'Yanzi Ke' (Swallow's Nest). At first, I did not know where the name 'Yanzi Ke' came from. Later, while visiting a friend's house in Guangdong, I heard my friend laughing upstairs. I went upstairs to look for him but could not find him. I looked up and glimpsed a small loft hidden behind the roof beam. I climbed up a precarious ladder and found that the loft was so low that one could not stand upright in it, so I slithered inside. My friend was sitting on the floor, wildly smoking opium with someone else. His foot was tapping on the roof tile. I could not help but exclaim in surprise. I suddenly understood that this was truly worthy of being called a 'Yanzi Ke'! The beams of a swallow's nest roof are similar to the secret rooms where people smoked opium, and the loft's low height is also equivalent to a swallow's nest. The reason for this arrangement is to allow the smoke to rise and escape through the roof, so that people downstairs cannot smell it. My friend said that most of the smoke rooms in Guangdong were like this. So, it seems that the 'Yanzi Ke' in Shanghai only adopted the name without the actual arrangement. Hehe.</p>
<p>Xiaonü Mohe (Filial Daughter Grinding Box)</p>
<p>Someone often smoked opium using an ox-tendon box, smoking it once a day, emptying the entire box each time. His residence was divided into three courtyards. The smoking room was located in the middle courtyard, while the bedroom where the opium was stored was in the rear courtyard. He always had his young daughter perform the task of running errands and fetching more opium. When the girl carried the empty box to the rear courtyard to get more opium, she had to pass by a large well. She would always carelessly wave her hand and make the box rub against the stone steps, making a loud sound as she found it amusing. The mouth of the box became worn out from the rubbing, so the body of the box gradually shrank, and the amount of opium it could hold decreased. However, the person did not know this. This went on for more than a year. The box was now just a bottom, and eventually there was no more opium to be held. His addiction had also been gradually reduced as a result. The girl's contribution was great. This is the incremental method in the various methods of quitting opium. The principle is the same as reducing the amount of addictive substances in medication, known as "diluting each cup." If one can persist in this method and implement it gradually, success is guaranteed.</p>
<h3>Junzhong Yanbu (Opium Rags in the Military)</h3>
<p>In the past, there were many smokers in the military, and judicial power could not reach them. I heard that the reason for Qi's defeat in the Jiangzhe War was the lack of "white flour" (白麵) in the military. ("White flour" is a hidden name for morphine. The military regarded it as more important than rice. Once it was suddenly cut off, the entire army was as good as dead and could not move.) Furthermore, the well-known brave generals Zang Zhiping and Yang Huazhao had soldiers in their divisions who would hang a short bamboo gun and an opium lamp around their waists, so they could stop at any time on mountain ridges or wild tombs, lie down, and smoke opium. Still fearing that the battle time would be too long and they would not have time to lie down and smoke, they would issue opium rags in advance before setting out. Each person would get one to hang on their chest, like the kind of rag that barbers used to sharpen razors. It was soaked in a large pot of opium paste, allowing it to absorb and saturate, and then it was dried by the wind. They could suck on it during battle for a few minutes, which would relieve their cravings. Their spirits would immediately be lifted, and there would be no interruption in their work. Their shooting accuracy would certainly improve.</p>
<h3>Seeking Experiences and Illness Reports on Quitting Opium</h3>
<p>Gentlemen who read this publication, if you have ever successfully quit opium or have not achieved satisfactory results, please tell us in detail about the process of quitting and the various illnesses you have discovered in ordinary times. So that we can study and solve difficulties for the public. Please also indicate your age, gender, physique, and contact address. So that we can respond to you. Sincerely, Tang Jiazhen, Chief Physician of the Home Medicine Society, inventor of Home Medicine Essentials.</p>
<h3>Consoling Smokers</h3>
<p>— Yinghua</p>
<p>Those who do not smoke often look down upon and belittle those who do, seeing them as lacking resolve, ambition, lazy, cowardly, and unwilling to quit. Even if they can quit temporarily, they eventually return to smoking, showing they are content with being inferior and have no desire to improve. Smokers are deeply saddened by such words, filled with grievances but dare not argue, as no one would believe them. Thus, they harbor resentment, and the feelings of smokers and anti-smokers can never be reconciled. This also creates an invisible obstacle to the implementation of tobacco policies. I will first speak on behalf of smokers to redress their grievances, then sincerely advise and persuade them, providing them with a foolproof remedy, so that they will be delighted and sincerely willing to extricate themselves.</p>
<p>The reason why it is difficult for smokers to quit, and the pain of quitting and then relapsing, is nothing more than three points. I dare to explain on their behalf as follows: 1. Of those compatriots who unfortunately fall into the clutches of the "black demon," 99% do so due to illness. The origins of the illness vary, but they largely involve liver and stomach pain, intercostal neuralgia, abdominal pain, muscle and bone pain, hemorrhoids, dysentery, hernia, nocturnal emission, insomnia, neurasthenia, cough, asthma, hemoptysis, bloating, indigestion, deficiency syndrome, constipation, etc.</p>
<p>Opium is originally the most effective remedy for pain, diarrhea, aiding digestion, and promoting blood circulation. It is especially necessary for cholera (vomiting and diarrhea). Pity that some use it often, solely relying on it for treatment, which easily leads to addiction. Therefore, many people in Europe and America are addicted to morphine (morphine is the essence of opium; Westerners do not use lamps and pipes to smoke, but prefer to inject or swallow morphine). If they don't use it for a day, all their illnesses recur, much like the withdrawal symptoms of the Chinese. Yawning, runny nose, tearing eyes, sweating, itchy throat causing cough, cold back, cramping pain in limbs and shoulders, urinary incontinence, even nocturnal emission, an extremely uncomfortable sensation in the kidneys, as if millions of ants are crawling in the blood vessels, bloating in the stomach, inability to eat, involuntary bowel movements, suddenly emptying and lying in feces, impaired sight and hearing, complete loss of memory, and the temporary recurrence of various old illnesses. The most common phenomenon is that smokers, upon waking up, feel lazy and颓唐 because the effects of the opium have worn off. Their limbs are unable to move, their speech is slow and difficult, and their liver becomes hyperactive and prone to anger, with family members and servants often subjected to unwarranted scolding. This is what non-smokers should witness. Considering that smokers are trapped in such a myriad of sufferings, shouldn't we be more understanding and tolerant of their inability to quit easily? 2. Most smokers gradually fall into poverty due to wasted time and loss of employment, experiencing the pain of difficult living conditions. They are also afraid of the government's strict laws and the extortion by unscrupulous ruffians. Who wouldn't want to quit smoking to escape this great burden? However, it is difficult to find doctors who can help quit smoking. Those who advertise in the market are merely speculators trying to make money, without adequate knowledge or skills. Some young and inexperienced practitioners use rapid quitting methods, only treating the symptoms, failing to understand the pain of those quitting, and not adopting a gradual reduction method while simultaneously providing fundamental treatment for underlying conditions. Even if, by chance, one encounters a steady and experienced doctor, they still lack safe and appropriate methods, free from negative consequences, and with consideration for aftercare. Therefore, although they may abstain for a while, they develop symptoms of edema and虚胖. Internally, various illnesses are brewing. Sooner or later, within three to five months, they will develop serious illnesses and strange sores, for which all medicines are ineffective. Only a little opium can immediately relieve the symptoms. This phenomenon is commonly known as "relapse." Famous European and American experts specializing in the treatment of drug addiction also acknowledge this (there are many theories from foreign famous doctors, which will be translated and published successively for public viewing). 3. Doctors charge at least tens of dollars for helping people quit smoking. How can the poor afford such expenses at once? Therefore, they would rather endure the burden of "interest-bearing" smoking, spending two or three 角 a day to prolong their lives. Since the advent of Kang Le Su (康樂素), the above problems have been readily solved. For opium-addicted compatriots, it is like encountering a savior from the brink of death, a treasure raft in the sea of suffering. It has been proven through repeated experiments to be the only wonderful product to assist in quitting smoking. It is peaceful and nourishing, without any adverse side effects. It allows for a gradual quitting method, without suffering any pain. After abstaining for a certain period, it still benefits the Qi and blood, enhances the spirit, and allows the body to gradually become healthier and disease-free. Therefore, there is no relapse, and no future troubles are guaranteed. Moreover, at the beginning of quitting, there is no need to immediately abstain from smoking (referring to licensed smokers). They can assess their physical strength and financial resources to determine the speed of reducing opium consumption (Kang Le Su combined with Fen Jing Shen (奮精神) ensures no pain during smoking reduction). How convenient is that! Strive, gentlemen! You can prosper! The country's survival depends on your joint efforts to save it.</p>

<h3>Little Boy (30)(8)</h3>
<p>— Original by American Ms. Alcott, Translated by Zheng Xiaocang (Zonghai)</p>
<p>Tao Ting was so shocked by the last sentence that he almost fell into the river. He grabbed the window sill, his eyes wide open, looking inside as if he were a taxidermied owl placed on the fireplace mantle in the room. No one dared to disobey when Mr. Pei said so. So Nai De took the stick, looking shocked and guilty as if he was about to stab his teacher to death. He lightly struck the outstretched hand twice. Then he stopped, looking up, his eyes filled with tears, unable to see clearly, but Mr. Pei said without changing his expression, "Again, hit harder."</p>
<p>As if seeing that this was inevitable and eager to get this difficult matter over with quickly, Nai De dragged his sleeve across his eyes and quickly struck two more heavy blows, his hand immediately turning red, but the one wielding the stick felt even more distressed.</p>
<p>"Isn't that enough?" he asked, but he could hardly breathe.</p>
<p>"Mr. Pei only replied, 'Two more'," so Nai De did as he was told, almost not knowing where he was hitting, then he threw the stick hard to the other side of the house, hugged the hand that had been hit with both hands, and sobbed with feelings full of love, respect, shame, and regret:</p>
<p>"I will remember! Oh, I definitely will!"</p>
<p>Mr. Pei then embraced him, changing his firm tone to a sympathetic one, and said:</p>
<p>"I think you will. May God help you, and strive to avoid making us have such an awkward scene again."</p>

<h3>Gold and Foreign Exchange Markets Show Turbulent and Unstable Conditions; Bulls and Bears Compete to Cover, Peak Reaching 897 Yuan; Foreign Exchange Surprisingly Weak, Ending Down 1.9 Yuan</h3>
<p>The gold market rose and fell yesterday, appearing chaotic. Major short sellers aggressively covered positions, with Huashang Bank and Sassoon sparking buying interest and causing prices to rise. However, banks and Jardine Matheson dumped gold, and the foreign exchange market was surprisingly firm, resulting in a decline. Early in the morning, the overseas silver market showed a slight decrease in London and no change in New York, but large traders said that the closing price was high at .0625, confirming the rumor of American buying. The forward silver price in Monterey remained unchanged or increased by 4% in different periods, and foreign exchange continued to contract. The price of spot gold in London rose by 3.5 pence, and market sentiment stabilized, as the after-hours trading had already risen. Pre-market trading opened at 90 yuan and 91 yuan. Dada Fuxing, Yonghui Xiang, and others took the opportunity to sell bars, reducing the price to 89 yuan. Dadecheng, Yongli, Hengyu, and Shenfeng actively bought, pushing the price back up to 94 yuan. Yingxiang, Chunyuan, Yonghui Xiang took the opportunity to supply at higher prices. The Central Bank announced its rates, with the pound unchanged and the US dollar down .0625. The customs gold unit rose by 3%, and the standard gold price was listed at 927.6 yuan, after which it stabilized. The morning opened high, and after the opening, banks offered gold, and sellers took advantage of the high prices to operate, briefly declining. However, with Sassoon still pulling up, the price quickly rose. Anticipating the HSBC rate, with the pound unchanged and the US dollar down .0625, the foreign exchange market tightened surprisingly after this. Continental and others were still buying, and buying interest from major players was extremely strong. Short sellers urgently covered their positions, and the price rose rapidly. The Central Bank took advantage of the high price to sell, and the price began to fall. However, with domestic goods still being purchased, the market showed a swirling pattern, and the market situation gradually became mediocre for quite some time. Later, with the foreign exchange market strengthening, Jewish merchant Jardine Matheson, Mitsui, and others dumped gold, finally causing the price to fall. However, major short sellers aggressively covered their positions at lower prices, maintaining the market. The domestic market remained weak. The predicted price of Indian silver was slightly lower by two annas. At noon, the market turned stable, struggling continuously. The afternoon market opened steadily, rising slightly at one point, but banks dumping gold and the foreign exchange market strengthening stimulated selling interest, gradually retreating within the 90 yuan mark.

<p>According to the New York raw silk report for last month, raw silk imports increased by 11,640 bales compared to the previous month. Total sales were 41,717 bales, of which 1,537 bales were Shanghai silk, an increase of 1,148 bales compared to the previous month. The list is as follows:</p>
<p>Gongxi Green Tea Slightly Active in Sales</p>
<p>The tea market is still trending weak. The sources of Zongyuan and Tunxi's various Zhen Dun Yuan killing are scarce, and transactions are extremely rare. Items such as needle eyebrow pearl tea are also generally dull in the market. Only Gongxi, Bath's Ruichang, Meixing, Yulong, and other companies have made slight purchases. The city has traded more than 300 boxes, and the market has shrunk to 18 or 19 yuan, down another three or four yuan from before. The losses suffered by Chinese tea merchants are enormous. English and Russian traders have no need for Qimen and Fuliang red teas, and the market is still in a slump.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Xianglian Production Telegram Rises by Three to Four Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of Xiangtan lotus production telegram goods rose due to a shortage of goods. The current price of 42.8 yuan for local lotus was previously 39 yuan, and has now risen to 42.4 yuan. New lotus shells were previously 35 or 36 yuan, and arrived yesterday at 40 yuan, an increase of three or four yuan. The Shanghai market also followed closely. "Wood ear" Yesterday, according to a telegram from Hankou, mixed ears saw a slight decline, falling from more than 90 yuan to 86 or 87 yuan. However, Gao Kui ears once reached 126 or 127 yuan, and have now tightened again to 138.6 yuan. The market trend is stable. "Black melon seeds" Yesterday, the No. goods opened with a small amount of several thousand bags, including 63 pieces of Mingguang seeds at 9.4 yuan, 419 bags of Taixing seeds at 10.06 to 11.2 yuan, and 480 bags of Wuhe seeds at 9.45 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Domestic Mianchi Asking Prices Loosen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw little trading due to the approaching Autumn Festival, and the trend was stable. The guild's opening price for No. 24 coarse white spot goods was 17.2 yuan, with dozens of bags traded. The re-export goods were quoted at the original price but did not trade. The factory's opening price for Mianbai No. 1 was 16.3 yuan, No. 2 was 2.2 yuan, No. 3 was .05 yuan, and No. 4 was 15.9 yuan. The Ji Zhong Cooperation Company's bidding period ended yesterday, and 480 bags of Wuyang coarse white from the original quota of 1,400 bags were traded at 17.1 yuan. 1,113 bags of Huizhou coarse white were not traded at 16.95 yuan. 20 bags of Guangzhou medium sand white from 1,000 bags were traded at 16.5 yuan. 130 bags of Dutch coarse white from 2,000 bags were traded at 17.2 yuan. A total of more than 600 bags of domestic Mianchi were opened in the past two days. The better ones were 11.7 yuan, and the others varied around 10 yuan, down by two or three cents from before.</p>
<h3>Metals: Sales of Qing Lead Iron Street are Uniquely Strong</h3>
<p>Due to the inferior quality of Qing lead and iron for the foreign trading houses' business, no additional orders were placed. However, transactions with factories have been very brisk recently. As a result, sales have reached as many as 500 boxes in recent days. The lowest asking price is 9 yuan, and the highest is 12.5 yuan. Because there are very few subsequent shipments of this product, people are very firm. Therefore, the market trend is quite optimistic.</p>
<h3>Thin Tinplate Price Increases by Three Yuan</h3>
<p>The recent arrival of 35-pound thin tinplate has been small and stocks are low, and the market sentiment is very good. Moreover, cigarette factories, biscuit factories, and other consumers have been consuming well recently, resulting in a large shortage of market goods. The standard has been pressured by the environment and has risen again by three yuan. The asking price is 53 yuan per box. It is said that seventy or eighty boxes were sold yesterday. Looking at the future market situation, there is still a potential for further increase.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Qiulang)</p>
<p>The ancients said, "Spring and autumn have many good days," and yes: festivals like "Qixi," "Mid-Autumn Festival," and "Double Ninth Festival" in autumn are not all good festivals and auspicious days? But these are only for the bourgeoisie and the leisured class to enjoy in time, as for those poor people, they are too busy making a living, how can they have this leisure and elegance! Especially the survivors of the disaster area, although they escaped death in the rolling torrent, their two major needs of "clothing" and "food" have no whereabouts as autumn and winter are approaching, how can they continue to survive? Perhaps sooner or later they will become starving corpses and frozen ghosts, thinking of this, how can it not make people's hearts ache!</p>
<p>"Autumn wind and autumn rain are heartbreaking," this is the famous sentence left by Qiu Jin, a female knight of Jian Lake. Originally, autumn scholars are mostly sentimental, and their ambitions are not fulfilled, how can they bear the invasion of wind and rain, and be driven into an atmosphere of sorrow and misery, so that he has nowhere to vent, and can only compose them into words and sentences for people to chant. Words are the voice of the heart, and emotions change with the environment. The number of autumn female knights in the world is truly like the sands of the Ganges!</p>
<h3>Autumn</h3>
<p>— Zhao Gengti</p>
<p>In the past, Dongpo's wife, on a clear spring night with plum blossoms in full bloom, said, "Spring moon is better than autumn moon. Autumn moon makes people feel miserable, and spring moon makes people feel harmonious. You can call Zhao Delin and his fellows to drink under these flowers." It provoked old Dongpo to say such poetic words for his wife, so he proudly wrote: "Light wind and thin mist are all places where young people can enjoy themselves, unlike autumn light, which only illuminates the broken heart of parting people." Here, the bleakness of autumn colors and the faint sorrow scattered in the world were all obliterated in their elegant conversation.</p>
<p>However, there are also some self-admiring people who, when poor and bored, still wear a contemptuous smile and satirize the actions of those who are obsessed with fame and fortune, worried about gains and losses, and hurriedly pursue what is but the achievement of snails on horns, and the ephemeral bubble. Instead, they praise "autumn scenery, every item is a good sentence." Generally, optimistic people do not want to see this thin autumn face. And the so-called commoners, do not have to be virtuous gentlemen, as long as they have habits that are out of step with the world, often have a green method of feeling sad about autumn, and those people only make people worry about their eternal frustration, unable to be lifted up.</p>
<p>Occasionally looking up, there are fleeting white clouds riding on the evening glow, inadvertently passing by, decorating the phoenix trees in this exquisite residential area, which have already revealed one or two haggard yellow spots. I suddenly blurted out: "The evening clouds carry two homeward flights urgently, going to make a night of sorrow by the west window." And a gust of cool wind stirred the thin summer clothes, and with it came a desolate feeling, attacking my brow. But I immediately became alert, as someone who floats and sinks with the world, I am definitely not worthy of imitating the commoners, chanting what "white lotus makes flowers, the wind is already autumn." And that kind of doomed frustrated fate seems to be intolerable in this world. Moreover, as long as one is not deaf and blind, one should also recognize the gradual decline of one's own race. Not washed away by the flood, not committing suicide because of unbearable hunger, in such a high-spirited season, taking advantage of the late dusk, quietly reading a volume or two of books, whether it is Zhuang Zhou's licentiousness or Lao Tzu's purity, that is already too lucky, too lucky! Furthermore, since I cannot bear the heavy responsibility of governing the country and securing the people, nor am I willing to quietly spend some ordinary days, but I come to play the old tune of lamenting autumn with white hair, provoking some unnecessary idle sorrows, I ask, who dares to do that?</p>
<h3>Greeting Autumn</h3>
<p>— Lan Shan</p>
<p>Once, under the continuous sad wind and miserable rain, in the hawking of hot cabbage blowing in front of the window, erratic and intermittent, touching people's hearts, as if warning me: "Hey! Autumn has come again!"</p>
<p>A slight chill ran down my body, although this is not yet cold weather.</p>
<p>Looking at the two phoenix trees outside the window, they used to be green and lush, but now they are gradually withering and yellowing. Once the golden wind moves, a few remnant leaves bid farewell to the old branches and fall to the ground, dancing with the wind.</p>
<p>Also from the distant, lonely, and old roof ridge, I saw the sad face of autumn, as if with some pallor, but it was silent and deep.</p>
<p>Autumn drove away the joy and warmth of spring from my heart. It also chased away the uninhibited豪情 (grand feelings) of summer, making people lonely and sentimental, sad and sighing.</p>
<p>It comes with a stern means, but it has no compassion for heaven and people. From now on, thousands of plants and trees will gradually lose their vitality. Even my only companion, these two phoenix trees outside the window, are no exception and are being destroyed.</p>
<p>However, under such a solemn situation, my heart is therefore more and more calm. All the unrestrained moods of the previous season are unconsciously suppressed.</p>
<p>In the lonely autumn night, I stood quietly in front of the window of the bedroom, with a cigarette in my hand, smoking non-stop. Leaning on the railing and looking into the distance, as far as my eyes can see, I occasionally saw a few autumn geese flying south in the azure sky, which is so full of poetic and pictorial meaning!</p>
<p>And autumn is most afraid of nostalgia, which can easily cause unwarranted怅触 (melancholy)! Thinking of the close friends of the past, now separated by the ends of the earth, I can't help but sigh to the autumn wind.</p>
<p>Try to gather up a piece of solid sorrow, settle the desolate heart, raise your eyes to see the clear moon, and sing the Shui Diao Ge Tou softly. I am also afraid that I will have the intention of飘飘有遐举 (rising to immortality), and at this moment, the autumn wind has blown away your sorrows.</p>
<p>Beloved and desolate autumn days! You are the old friend of a pessimistic person like me!</p>
<h3>Leaves Fall, Lamenting Autumn</h3>
<h3>Autumn Night</h3>
<p>— Shui Rong</p>
<p>Twilight quietly climbed up the deep eaves, and the noble shadows of the amaranth in the yard faded in the leap of thin dusk. A crow croaked outside the window, and then flew away, skimming over the low roof, and in the distance a chimney exhaled light green smoke.</p>
<p>With a lonely heart, I ran down the broken building. Leaving the door ajar, I strolled out, and a sound of autumn greeted me. I shuddered.</p>
<p>Walking, lonely; there was no one around, no voices. The moon, like a Guangbing (a type of cake) gnawed by a mouse, stayed in the sky boredly; the few stars were squinting, and the Milky Way lay sadly in the center. The sounds of autumn insects and the croaking sounds filled the remaining space of the human world.</p>
<p>The road is long, and the darkness stretches to some unknown place. I turned a corner next to a farmhouse with a hand-operated spinning wheel. Forming an acute angle, a clear stream flowed out. It was like white gauze, filtering the moonlight, and I could see the miraculous pebbles inside clearly.</p>
<p>Staring at the silent stream for a while, my heart was also filtered with general desolation. Suddenly, I walked forward again! This time the pace was no longer leisurely, I seemed to have a purpose.</p>
<p>Finding the place I loved, I sat down. It was next to an ancient tomb, an unnamed tomb. This field of grass was as soft as velvet, hibiscus exuded fragrance, the wind sighed on the ancient pine with a very long shadow, and crickets sang a sad dirge.</p>
<p>I picked some hibiscus to make a pillow, and used the lush grass as a mattress. I wanted to spend the night here under the comfort of nature. Just one night was enough!</p>
<h3>Autumn Boudoir Poem</h3>
<p>— Selected by Zilan Zhuren</p>
<p>The sweet-scented osmanthus weather is pitiful tonight, the fragrance fills the cloud screen and the heat dissipates, I smile in the tent and first wish you well, remember that my birthday is tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>Sleeping together makes me feel that the embroidered quilt is wide, I don't know that the autumn is deep and the afternoon dream is cold, the most is by the mandarin duck pillow by the window in the morning, the red cheeks have no way to avoid the gentleman's gaze.</p>
<p>A piece of the Milky Way hangs over the autumn city, to worship the double stars by the moon, the heart learns incense and has no other wishes, I wish the gentleman a longer life than the concubine.</p>
<p>The orchid lamp shines on the silver screen, the sound of the jade pestle stops without a sound, the red railing is as cool as water, I open the bead curtain to count the autumn stars.</p>
<p>Begonia flowers bloom on the green steps, the courtyard is full of autumn and the fallen leaves are at the beginning, I snatch the red persimmon leaves from the well railing, and grind the fragrant ink myself to ask the gentleman to write a book.</p>
<p>The green locust shadow turns to the small balustrade, the eight-foot dragon beard jade basket is cold, I open a fan from the red window myself, let him look at the bright moon by the pillow.</p>
<h3>Autumn Meanderings</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>Yellow willow leaves fill the creek. Miss Wang standing on that naturally formed "Fairy Right" rock, can no longer have a photo taken by Mr. Lu capturing its reflection. The waterfall constantly pounds down from that mountain hollow every day, even becoming somewhat tiresome to watch. Moreover, after several days of autumn wind and rain, the sounds of monkey cries and pine trees possess a certain melancholic power. Miss Wang, sleeping in her tulle mosquito net at the summer villa, quietly began to long for that autumn dance attire and those palatial ballrooms. How tender and graceful!</p>
<p>Therefore, Miss Wang decided to descend the mountain. Suitcases, luggage, local products... all to be personally escorted to Shanghai by Mr. Lu on a later date. Before leaving, Miss Wang gave Mr. Lu an autumn-wave-like glance, expressing her gratitude.</p>
<p>"Shanghai North Station," as the express train pulled into the platform, porters wearing red Turkish hats frantically jumped onto the train. "First-class seat," Miss Wang was helped off the train by a middle-aged man wearing "professor glasses." Upon exiting the station, she was helped into a cream-yellow, streamlined sports car suited for autumn. Driving to the Rising Sun Building, they were stopped by a red traffic light. The man wearing "professor glasses" took the cigar from his lips, smiled and said, "What do you think of Shanghai's atmosphere? Doesn't feel unfamiliar, does it?" Miss Wang cast a sidelong glance: "Shanghai is, after all, Shanghai!" She looked at the "Autumn Grand Sale" posters plastered on the glass windows of large companies, twitching her right leg resting on her left.</p>
<p>Turning west from Nanjing Road, the plane tree leaves on both sides of Jing'an Temple Road also appeared withered. A few were blown onto the gray-white road surface, tumbling before being crushed by the car wheels. The windows of the Grand Hotel slowly changed color, and a whiff of Cuban coffee wafted in through the car window. Miss Wang wrinkled her nose: "I wonder which place has good music these days. I'll go there tonight, that 'New Foxtrot' has become a little rusty."</p>
<p>Under the green lights, amidst the intoxicating fragrance, on the springy dance floor, floated an autumnal dance dress of silver satin inlaid with bright white mirror and black trim. An old dance enthusiast said: "Miss Wang is making her first appearance since the weather turned cooler." The dance hall manager said: "From now on, this place will be lively again!"</p>
<h3>Old Feelings in New Autumn</h3>
<p>— Yafei</p>
<p>The wheel of time ceaselessly turns. That lovely yet hateful summer has quietly slipped away, and this pensive autumn has also silently descended. Thus, years of old wounds and new scars stir again in my broken heart. At the same time, the lake of my heart, which had been as still as stagnant water for so long, cannot help but ripple once more.</p>
<p>The first thing that will make me forever feel lonely on the path of life is the shattering of my peace. Its destruction took away my lively heart, shattered my beautiful dreams, and plunged my life into a heavy shade of gray.</p>
<p>I remember last year, also in autumn, I happily embarked on my journey home, dreaming of returning to my hometown. At that time, my sister An knew that her only younger brother was coming home, so she specially put aside all household chores and rushed to the riverbank to wait for me. When she saw me, how happy she was, how excited! I believe this kind of joy and excitement had never been revealed in her heart since adulthood. Especially that slight smile, the meaning contained in that smile could never be analyzed by superficial people. She knew I loved to eat fresh water chestnuts, so she sent a load of fresh water chestnuts just picked from the lake.</p>
<p>When I got home, I couldn't say anything. So, for a long period of time, we remained silent. There was not a single word that could express our inner thoughts. After years of separation, once we met, we felt relatively silent. That pure, warm feeling did not get a chance to be unleashed, and was only conveyed in our mutual silence. They hoped for me, expected me to bring back some glory and success. But what did I bring back? A few inexpensive items of luggage, an already weakened body, an elderly person's state of mind, and a young man's pale face! I was truly ashamed to see them. However, at the same time, I felt unspeakable gratitude. Gratitude made me unable to stop the hot tears from hanging down from my withered cheeks. I wanted to tell them about my situation in the past few years, how much injustice I had suffered, and how much cold treatment I had encountered. But, but how could I say it, how could I bear to say it! They hoped for me, they expected me, and I finally returned with boundless disappointment! I really wanted to cry. I wanted to throw myself into my kind mother's arms like a child suffering from injustice, and cry bitterly, to exchange for her kind comfort, to caress my wounded soul. But how could I bear to further wound her fragile heart! I still restrained my tears, suppressed my sorrow, and forced myself to put on a cheerful face against my will!</p>
<p>Now it is autumn again. Although I want to go back, how can I bear to go back again? Perhaps by now, the weeds on An's grave have grown several feet long. She sleeps forever underground. How could she know that her wandering younger brother, on a desolate autumn night, is mourning for her in a foreign land... I will respectfully offer a wisp of sorrow at her grave!</p>

<h3>Measles</h3>
<p>— Physician Yu Bofu</p>
<p>Children's birth has two major misfortunes. One is smallpox. The other is measles. However, since the invention of vaccination, smallpox can be avoided. But there is still no way to prevent measles.</p>
<p>Measles is also called rubella, and is also known as the measles rash. Its degree of danger is inversely proportional to age. That is, the younger the age, the greater the danger.</p>
<p>Measles is extremely contagious. The patient's tears, nasal mucus, phlegm, and excrement, clothes and utensils are, of course, contagious. Even the surrounding air and dust, and even the skin shed by the patient when they are about to recover, can be spread by the wind and infect others. Therefore, if measles is discovered nearby, strict isolation is essential.</p>
<p>Patients should avoid meat and fish. Even smelling them can prevent the measles from being properly expressed. Therefore, the wet nurse should also eat vegetarian food. Food should be easily digestible, such as porridge, soup, milk, and eggs. Avoid getting cold, and avoid drafts. If there are accompanying symptoms such as cough, diarrhea, or other symptoms, then hundreds of complications can occur, becoming even more dangerous. It is essential to seek medical treatment.</p>
<p>For those Suffering from Nocturnal Emission</p>
<h3>Discussion on the Equal Importance of Abstinence and Semen Retention</h3>
<p>— Physician Zheng Huimin</p>
<p>Nocturnal emission is more common among scholars than among warriors, and more common in urban areas than in rural areas. Therefore, it is also known as the scholar's disease and the urban disease. Patients may leak during the night while dreaming, or emit without dreaming. Precious essence, the source of life, flows out incessantly, damaging life and causing disease. Therefore, patients are all terrified and apprehensive, forcibly abstaining in order to prevent leakage. Yet, the emission persists. What is the reason?</p>
<p>According to the theory, nocturnal emission is caused by the relaxation of the vas deferens. The gate of semen is not secure, and the essence is eager to come out. Although abstaining from sex is the usual advice, it is only a superficial treatment. It is necessary to strengthen the gate of semen to get to the root of the problem.</p>
<p>For retaining semen, the most effective formula is "Dr. Schmidt's Semen Retention Tablets," made according to the secret formula of Dr. Schmidt, a German venereal disease expert. The medicine is kingly. It strengthens the gate of semen. I often prescribe it to patients suffering from nocturnal emission. Its effect is invariably seen the same night. It is also a shortcut to treating nocturnal emission.</p>
<h3>Treatment of Leukorrhea and Infertility</h3>
<p>— Physician Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>Leukorrhea in women has various causes. Patients have a purulent secretion in the vagina that is highly acidic. When male sperm enters, it is immediately destroyed. If pregnancy is desired for the sake of succession, there is absolutely no hope.</p>
<p>However, women are bound by old ethical teachings. If they suffer from leukorrhea, they often keep it a secret and dare not seek medical treatment, considering it shameful. On the one hand, it endangers their own health and happiness. On the other hand, pregnancy is hopeless, which is truly pitiable.</p>
<p>Therefore, self-treatment is convenient for women suffering from leukorrhea. The advent of "Leukorrhea Remedy" for self-treatment of leukorrhea is truly a great blessing for female patients.</p>
<p>"Leukorrhea Remedy" functions to clear purulent secretions and promote the reproduction of beneficial vaginal bacilli. Therefore, it is invariably effective for symptoms such as cervicitis, cervical catarrh, gonorrheal vaginitis, and vulvar dampness and erosion. I often use it in my clinical practice. The results are very satisfactory. Moreover, its ease of use and the perfection of its medicinal properties are secondary matters.</p>
<h3>Various Aspects of Menstruation</h3>
<p>— Physician Zhao Zhigao</p>
<p>Menstruation refers to the uterine bleeding that occurs in women approximately every twenty-eight days from the time puberty begins until the time it permanently ceases.</p>
<p>Its color is dark red, like venous blood. The average amount is about three taels (approximately 100 ml). Its properties, besides containing secretions from the uterus and vagina, mucus from the cervix, and a large number of bacteria, are no different from the blood in the human body.</p>
<p>The origin of menstruation is the congestion of the mucosal epithelium on the inner surface of the uterus due to the pressure of ovarian rupture stimulation. As congestion continues, it gradually peels off. Small blood vessels also rupture, resulting in bleeding. This is what is called menstruation.</p>
<p>Hygiene is most important during menstruation. Avoid sexual intercourse, labor, travel, dancing, and overeating. It is best to rest quietly. Locally, a menstrual belt made of cotton or gauze can be used to absorb the discharged menstrual blood. Do not make it too tight. If it is too tight, it will cause a blockage, and menstrual blood will not be able to flow out, accumulating in the vagina and causing putrefactive vaginitis. In the old customs of our country, women often used coarse cloth and rough paper during menstruation. It was filthy and inferior, the absorbent power was weak, and there were many bacteria. Paper scraps entered the vagina, often causing vaginitis and other symptoms, which is extremely unsanitary.</p>
<h3>Treatment of Neurasthenia</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xiaohan, Physician</p>
<p>(Symptoms) Headache, heaviness of the head, pessimism in everything, forgetfulness, mood swings, insomnia, nervousness, back pain, lower back pain, excessive sweating, cold hands and feet, palpitations, cold sensations or hot flashes, weakness throughout the body, rapid pulse, fatigue, frequent urination, premature ejaculation, spermatorrhea, nocturnal emission, and weakness (the latter four are specifically called sexual neurasthenia).</p>
<p>(Causes) Malnutrition, excessive use of the brain and little physical activity, excessive mental stimulation, sexual overexertion, excessive masturbation, endocrine disorders, chronic poisoning, and weakness after illness.</p>
<p>(Treatment) Endocrine preparations (i.e., gonadotropins) are the main treatment, supplemented by iron phosphate arsenic and strychnine.</p>
<p>(Health Preservation) Stop using the brain, practice physical exercises, moderate sexual desire, abstinence, water baths, electrical massage, eat more milk, chicken broth, eggs, and plants rich in chlorophyll, quit smoking and alcohol, be optimistic, forget worries, rest the mind, have no anger, and have no emotional impulses, travel more in the mountains and fields.</p>
<p>(Note) Those who also suffer from the latter four symptoms of spermatorrhea, etc., should first take Schmidt's "Semen Retention Tablets" internally for treatment, and then use "Gonadotropins" to achieve full effect.</p>
<h3>Incomplete Development</h3>
<p>— Physician Yu Bofu</p>
<p>Many patients suffer from incomplete development. Because there are no obvious symptoms such as pain, people often neglect it, letting a good and promising body deteriorate day by day without cultivation. Is this not lamentable?</p>
<p>Incomplete development is mostly caused by congenital deficiency or acquired imbalance. Being a person is like planting flowers. Dry and barren soil, and a lack of rain and dew, can all cause flowers to wither. It is necessary to select fertile soil and moisten it with rainwater for it to thrive. If the human body lacks nutrition or there is insufficient endocrine secretion among the organs, it will cause damage to all parts of the body and depression of the spirit. Hoping for development in this way is like climbing a tree to catch fish. One can only see it approaching an impasse.</p>
<p>With the recent advancement of medicine, since the advent of "Reproductive Essence" and endocrine preparations, great success has been achieved. Taking it into the human body can fill the spinal cord and brain marrow, nourish the limbs and bones, and allow the human body to develop fully, the spirit to be invigorated, the physical strength to be strengthened, health to be strong, and hundreds of diseases to be avoided. The joy of life will naturally come, and one will reach a happy state. It is truly a great help to the medical community.</p>
<p>Recently, in my clinical practice, I often gladly use "Reproductive Essence" to treat incomplete development, congenital deficiency, and acquired imbalance. The results often meet my expectations, so I have specifically written about it.</p>
<h3>Various Aspects of Nocturnal Emission</h3>
<p>— Physician Ma Jimei</p>
<p>Nocturnal emission refers to the involuntary discharge of semen in men who are single, both unpredictable and uncontrollable.</p>
<p>There are two types of nocturnal emission: physiological and pathological. Frequent nocturnal emissions that cause various discomforts and illnesses are all pathological and should be treated quickly.</p>
<p>The most common causes of nocturnal emission are sexual overexertion and masturbation. Others, such as being unmarried in adulthood, prolonged celibacy, or physical weakness after illness, can also trigger it.</p>
<p>Nocturnal emission can occur with or without dreams. Delaying treatment can lead to relaxation of the seminal vesicles, deep-seated disease, and ultimately neurasthenia and decline.</p>
<p>Nocturnal emission should be treated by addressing both the symptoms and the root cause. Failure to do either will make the treatment ineffective. Take Schmidt's "Semen Retention Tablets" to strengthen the seminal vesicles and directly stop the nocturnal emission. Use Steiner's "Reproductive Essence" to nourish the original Yang and replenish the deficiency. At the same time, quit masturbation and control sexual desires. There is no case of this condition that cannot be cured.</p>
<h3>Efficacy of Stomach Pain Remedy</h3>
<p>— Physician Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>The number of stomach medicines on the market is gradually increasing. However, those that are truly effective are as rare as morning stars. In my clinical practice, I like to use "Stomach Pain Remedy" for patients with stomach pain, because its name matches its effectiveness. I will now describe my clinical experience. The range of conditions this medicine treats includes stomach disorders caused by hyperacidity (i.e., gastrectasia), gastroptosis, weak stomach, gastritis, acid regurgitation, and stagnation. It is also notably effective for acute gastritis caused by overeating, ingesting indigestible or rotten substances, gastric neuralgia, spinal tuberculosis, gastric ulcer, or stomach pain induced by excessive drinking or smoking. Moreover, "Stomach Pain Remedy" is easy to take and has no irritating effect on the stomach. It does not inhibit stomach secretions and does not impair digestive function. It is truly beneficial and harmless. Patients should pay attention to it.</p>

Also take Steiner's "Reproductive Essence" to nourish the entire body. All your ailments will then disappear. You will become healthy and strong and live a long life.</p>
<p>Life is Boring</p>
<p>I masturbated when I was young, which has affected my development. Although I am now married, sexual intercourse is short-lived and unsatisfying. Moreover, I am experiencing a variety of diseases, such as lower back pain, back pain, insomnia, headaches, and weakness in the limbs. Life is truly tasteless. A friend once advised me to take Steiner's Reproductive Essence. I don't know if this medicine is suitable for my condition. Please advise. Asked by the Owner of Yihong Studio.</p>
<p>Answer: This medicine not only strongly replenishes kidney energy, but also has the authority to treat internal organs. Therefore, compared to your ailments, it is truly the right medicine for your condition. Taking it will be beneficial and without harm.</p>

When at home, he is depressed and unhappy. With slight exertion, he experiences mental and physical exhaustion. He often feels soreness and pain in the spine. Memory and judgment cannot be concentrated. He is drowsy in the early morning and sleepless at night. Trembling hands and palpitations make life unbearable. (Treatment) - I examined the patient's pituitary gland and found it to be aging. Therefore, I used electrotherapy to guide it back to normal. For the endocrine deficiency, I instructed him to purchase Steiner's "Reproductive Essence" at the Zhengwei Pharmacy. After about seven courses, his youth was restored, his sexual function became healthy, and all his ailments gradually healed.</p>
<p>2. Suffering from Nocturnal Emission and Premature Ejaculation</p>
<p>Patient: Lu Tingyao, 24 years old, from Taiyuan, Shanxi, in the banking industry. (Chief complaint) - Nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation. Treatment was unsuccessful and unsustainable. Mental and physical strength was depleted. (Medical history) - Congenital deficiency, sick since childhood. After puberty, he was poisoned by lewd books, leading to masturbation and excessive depletion. He suffered from nocturnal emission, resulting in physical weakness and brain decay. Various kidney deficiency diseases arose one after another. At the age of twenty-one, he married Miss Zhang under his parents' orders. After marriage, he勉强应付 (lit. "barely coped"), and his condition worsened. Premature ejaculation also became severe, accompanied by systemic symptoms such as lower back pain, back pain, insomnia, and blurred vision. Treatment was ineffective and medication did not work. Tossed and turned, suffering greatly. Later, he was introduced to me by Doctor Shi Fumin for treatment. (Current symptoms) - Relaxation of the seminal vesicles, swelling of the prostate gland, endocrine deficiency. (Treatment) - Prescribed Schmidt's "Semen Retention Tablets." Instructed him to take one dose before bedtime, and "Reproductive Essence" after each meal. At the same time, administered surgical electrotherapy. After two months, all symptoms disappeared. He was once again a man in all his glory.</p>

<h3>Review of Coil Issues</h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>——Using Iron Core Coils——</p>
<p>The necessary conditions for a perfect radio include high sensitivity, good selectivity, balanced amplification of signals of different high and low pitches, and a large signal-to-noise ratio. Of course, any part of the radio can affect these many conditions, but the design of the coil is particularly important.</p>
<p>Most of the current radios are five-tube, and their coordination is exemplified as follows: One – oscillation and first wave detection mixing stage, commonly using 6A7 vacuum tube; one – intermediate amplification stage, using 78 or 6D6 tube; one – second wave detection and automatic address control mixing stage, using 75 tube; and one – audio frequency output stage, using 41 or 42 tube. (The same is true when using 2.5V vacuum tubes.) This type of radio, due to the limitation of the number of vacuum tubes, only has one intermediate amplification stage, so the total amplification force needs to be increased as much as possible, which can also improve selectivity. After this point can be satisfactorily resolved, the remaining problems are the design of the antenna stage and the oscillation stage coils, and how to improve the performance of the radio.</p>
<p>When designing the oscillation killing coil, because it is necessary to consider location and economy, small superimposed ones are often used. If a single-layer coil with a large diameter can be used instead, the performance will of course be better, but the improvement can only enhance the sensitivity, and the solution of the remaining conditions must rely on the antenna coil.</p>
<p>The antenna coils currently wound in radios are extremely small, especially those with isolation shields, which significantly weaken the efficiency. The only remedy is to use a diagonal superimposed winding method in the hope of slightly reducing losses.</p>
<p>The loss of the coil is enough to limit the improvement of its sensitivity and selectivity. Therefore, to design an ideal coil, it is necessary to first analyze the causes of coil loss and then seek ways to eliminate them. The main causes of coil loss can be divided into the following three items:</p>
<p>1. Through-sensing body loss between insulation layers</p>
<p>2. Eddy current loss of conductors and isolators</p>
<p>3. Resistance loss of the conductor itself</p>
<p>(1) The source of through-sensing body loss is due to the inevitable existence of capacitance between conductors. Therefore, this capacitance must be reduced to a minimum. If an appropriate diagonal cross-winding coil can be used, this loss can be expected to be reduced to a minimum. The more times each turn is crossed, the smaller the loss. One crossing is sufficient for long-wave radio coils, but because broadcast radio has a higher frequency, the through-sensing body loss is greater, and four or five crossings per turn are required to be satisfactory. Another method to reduce through-sensing body loss is to use double-layer silk-covered wire to increase the thickness of the green insulation layer and reduce its capacitance, which can naturally reduce the loss.</p>
<p>(2) The method to reduce the eddy current loss of the conductor is to use stranded wire twisted from many fine wires, each of which is insulated with enamel. For the eddy current loss of insulators, materials with lower resistance, such as copper, aluminum, and zinc, can also be selected, and the distance between them and the coil can be increased to reduce it.</p>
<p>(3) In order to solve the problem of resistance loss of the conductor itself, I don't know how much brainpower wireless engineers have spent. It is generally believed that to reduce resistance loss, the coil with the specified inductance should be shortened as much as possible, and attention should be paid to the medium in the coil. It is necessary to select a substance with greater magnetic induction than air to compensate for the weakening of the coil's inductance and still maintain the specified value.</p>
<p>For many years, many engineers have wanted to implement the structure of a power transformer on a high-frequency coil. They have tested various iron sheets, iron filings, and fine iron wires as the iron core of the coil. Although each test has achieved considerable improvement, the extremely high broadcast frequency current, eddy current losses would inevitably occur, resulting in more harm than good.</p>
<p>Comparatively speaking, iron filings are the most satisfactory, but they must be broken down into extremely small particles, almost visible under a microscope, and each particle must be separately insulated. This complex and difficult device can only be tested in large-scale laboratories and cannot be used for widespread commercial use. In short, the manufacture of iron-core coils is still in its infancy and awaits future improvements.</p>
<h3>Key Points for Making AC Radios</h3>
<p>— Zhou Wende</p>
<p>DC radios are inconvenient to use, and the monthly battery cost is around two yuan. Therefore, amateur enthusiasts generally prefer to make AC radios. If an AC radio is easy to make and has excellent sound quality, that goes without saying. However, if the construction method is slightly incorrect, many problems will arise. Now, I will write down a few key points gained from experience for fellow enthusiasts:</p>
<p>(1) When making an AC radio, the arrangement of all components has a great impact. Loud AC hum is very annoying. Based on experience, when installing, do not fix them with screws or solder. Connect them only with copper wires and test the sound. If the sound is poor, you can rearrange them and test the sound until you get the best method, and then fix them. Otherwise, if you fix them with screws and solder first, it will be very inconvenient to remove the screws and solder after testing if you find it unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>(2) When making, be careful to prevent metal objects from falling in, otherwise short circuits can easily occur. At least there will be no sound, and at worst the entire machine will be damaged. Be sure to be careful.</p>
<p>(3) When we make transformerless AC radios (such as using 25Z5 vacuum tubes as transformer substitutes), we must be especially careful because it is easy to get an electric shock. It is best to keep it in an insulated wooden box to avoid danger.</p>
<p>(4) The components used in the construction must be checked one by one for broken wires, short circuits, or other damaged parts. Sometimes one broken thing is enough to affect the entire machine.</p>
<p>(5) When making an AC radio, danger may occur due to the destruction of the wires or short circuits in the transformer. Therefore, it is best to add a switch and a fuse to the wires during testing to prevent danger.</p>
<p>(6) When making, you must first know whether the power supply to the radio matches the transformer you want to install. For example, the power supply in the French Concession is 110V, and the power supply in the International Settlement is 220V. If you use a 220V primary transformer with a 110V power supply, or use a 110V primary transformer with a 220V power supply, danger will occur.</p>
<p>(7) The wiring of AC radios must have surface insulation, as even a slight short circuit is very dangerous.</p>
<p>(8) The fixed capacitors (FixedCondinser) used in AC radios are mostly those that can withstand high-voltage current. Do not confuse them with the paper fixed capacitors used in DC radios, which can cause danger. Therefore, it is best to consult a radio supply store or someone with experience before making.</p>
<p>(9) The vacuum tubes used in AC radios are specific. For example, 30, 31, and other vacuum tubes are used in DC machines and are not suitable for AC radios. The ones used in AC radios must be AC vacuum tubes or AC/DC vacuum tubes. Therefore, do not make a mistake.</p>
<h3>Amateur Musings (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Wu Yingjian</p>
<p>Last winter, I made an AC four-tube radio, and I thought the results were quite good. I used it for a long time and never had any problems, nor were any parts damaged. But once, the variable resistor for adjusting the volume suddenly lost its effect. When rotating the volume knob, the volume could not be gradually increased or decreased. It was either loud or silent. Later, I took it apart and saw that most of the carbon material inside had fallen off. I tried to apply it carefully with a pencil, but it didn't work. I always felt uncomfortable in my heart, and I had to find a replacement method to feel at ease. Where there's a will, there's a way. As a result, I found a very good volume adjustment method. The original machine had a tone adjuster connected to the screen grid of the power amplifier tube, as shown in the figure. Originally, it was a series connection of a .02MF fixed capacitor and a 50,000-ohm variable resistor. Now, I replaced the .02MF fixed capacitor with a 1MF fixed capacitor, and it became a very good volume adjuster.</p>
<h3>Low Resistivity Fixed Carbon Resistors</h3>
<p>— Pao</p>
<p>In the damping circuit, the damping is usually as small as possible. However, sometimes in order to obtain a flatter selectivity curve, a resistor with a small resistivity and no self-inductance is intentionally connected. These resistors have always been specially wound wire-wound resistors with no self-inductance. Because in fact, there are no fixed carbon resistors with low resistivity on the market for use.</p>
<p>Recently, the American Ohiohm factory has produced a set of fixed carbon resistors with a wide variety of types. The resistivity is as low as 0.04 ohms and as high as 100 megohms (100Megohm); the power ranges from one-quarter watt to ten watts; the variety of colors is sufficient for general applications; and fixed carbon resistors with small resistivity, which have always been difficult to buy, can now be purchased.</p>
<p>The appearance of this resistor is the same as that of ordinary fixed carbon resistors. During manufacturing, it was tested under the standards stipulated by the Radio Manufacturers Association (R.M.A.) in the United States, and the results exceeded the qualified standards by a large margin. It is said that it can be used normally even in the harsh climate of the two seasons in the tropics.</p>

<h3>The Responsibility of Intellectuals to the Publishing Industry</h3>
<p>— Zeng Jianping</p>
<p>In recent years, due to the poverty of the general public and the failure of several revolutionary movements in the past, the publishing industry, which once had vitality, has quickly declined. Large bookstores, like the bourgeoisie, have completely become prisoners of feudal landlords and no longer dare to advocate a little bit of progressive revolutionary consciousness: small bookstores, however, have completely exposed the faces of their small property owners and returned to the shadow of taste. This kind of specialized and concrete performance is that some parties are printing their ancient books in large quantities, while others are publishing tempting reading materials that are full of carnal desires. The current trend in the publishing industry completely exposes the suicidal tendencies of Chinese publishing intellectuals—even the national people's lives.</p>
<p>The occurrence and development of this tendency does not seem to be a matter of the last year or two. However, our progressive intellectuals—the writing community and the reading community—are completely silent, not daring to give this tendency a forceful blow: even many writers who have been relatively progressive in the past dare not put forward serious criticisms. Certain publishing organizations are carrying out their restoration, anti-era, and anti-revolutionary movements in a planned way; but progressive readers are adopting a liberal attitude towards this reactionary tendency and movement. They willingly learn to be ostriches, hiding their heads in a place where they cannot see danger. If it is said that today's publishing industry is "equivalent to sending opium to the people" (as Mr. Li Maimai said): then, our intellectuals are no different from tacitly approving the public sale of red pills by those who kill the nation. In recent years, the corruption of the general public's thoughts and the degradation of the general public's lives, our progressive intellectuals should bear a heavy responsibility.</p>
<p>Although the emergence and development of the fashion of an era inevitably has its objective conditions. However, the power to change customs actually relies on the subjective resistance of our progressives. The political depression and economic bankruptcy in China in recent years are enough to create the reactionary, restorationist, and romantic decadent tendencies of the modern publishing and reading communities: but this tendency can be reduced and purged through a broad and powerful resistance movement. If no one wants to read ancient books, the large bookstores that publish ancient books will close or change direction; if no one wants to read pornographic books and comics, the small bookstores that publish pornographic books and comics will inevitably go bankrupt and cannot be supported. The creation of a good atmosphere in the reading community is mainly due to the call of progressive intellectuals: not in the transformation of large and small publishing organizations that aim for profit. If our intellectuals are willing to always learn the ostrich's method; then, where can we talk about the revolutionary cultural movement and the revolutionary national movement!</p>
<p>Therefore, if the current intellectuals in China are not willing to implement chronic suicide in the cultural field, then at this time, we should rise up: from criticism, create a broad critical movement to attack the current reactionary restoration movement; from enlightenment, create a powerful cleansing movement to purge all decadent tendencies that endanger the nation. Actively learn from the Japanese and British people, especially the Russians, and publish systematically small series of books and small libraries in the style of libraries on a large scale. Not only should it be developed from literature, but it should also be developed from the theoretical parts of various departments of natural science and social science. If not, if revolutionary intellectuals only seek temporary safety and leisure, then the development of the publishing industry that is currently publishing ancient books in large quantities will inevitably completely clear the past achievements of our national revolution and cultural revolution, and drag the times back again.</p>
<p>If this era—an era that has gone through several cultural and political revolutions—is dragged back by the current corrupt booksellers and armed men's guests who promote the reading of scriptures with whips: then, the revolutionary intellectuals, at that time, in addition to being guests again, will reduce—no, will disappear—his historical mission and the significance of promoting the era in culture. Therefore, the only way for intellectuals to liberate and save themselves at present is not to surrender to the booksellers who promote the restoration movement and the armed men who promote the reading of scriptures, and resolutely urge the current publishing industry to save our descendants, save the revolution, and save themselves!</p>
<h3>Talking About Tools and Reference Books</h3>
<p>— Chen Haochu</p>
<p>Whether standing in the position of a reader or the position of a library, we have very sufficient reasons to hope that the publishing industry will pay more attention to the compilation and printing of tools and reference books. The current teaching method is not just to let students read some textbooks to death, but to hope to cultivate students' ability to automatically refer to research: on the other hand, the poor and studious people who are forced to run around for food and clothing all day long, they cannot have a whole day of leisure to go to the library to browse various books, and they also very much hope that there are reference books that can save their energy, so the compilation and publication of tool books is what today's readers unanimously expect.</p>
<p>The scope of reference books is very broad. In a broad sense, all kinds of books have the value and mission of being referenced; here we add the word "tool", which stipulates his narrow scope, that is, only books that are used as tools. This type of reference book, in terms of compilation style, is based on the collection of various facts, arranged and compiled according to law, for the purpose of checking, from the library's point of view, it is usually placed separately, only for readers to check and not to borrow. From the user's point of view, it is not necessary to read carefully at ordinary times, but only to check at the necessary time to assist in the study and advancement of reading and research. According to this strict meaning, the so-called tool reference books are only dictionaries, dictionaries, encyclopedias, type books, chronological tables, yearbooks, indexes, etc. These types of books are what we hope the publishing industry will pay more attention to publishing.</p>
<p>The compilation of tool reference books has a long history in China. "Erya" has the method of dividing sections, and "Shuowen" has the system of radicals, which has evolved to the "Kangxi Dictionary", and dictionaries have almost the same long history as Chinese characters. As for chronological tables, Taishi Gong wrote the "Historical Records" in the early Han Dynasty, and he created the method of parallel oblique lines of the Zhou Genealogy: Wan Sitong's "Chronological Tables of Past Dynasties" and Qi Zhaonan's "Chronological Tables of Past Dynasties" are even more masterpieces of history. During the Wei Wen Emperor period, Wang Xiang and others compiled scriptures and gathered them according to type, and compiled the book "Huanglan", which opened the source of Chinese type books; after that, the compilation became popular in various dynasties, and many were completed. During the Ming Dynasty, Ling Dizhi compiled the "Wanxing Tongpu" in 140 volumes, which dates back to ancient times and the Ming Dynasty. It comprehensively covers the surname and clan system, with rhyme as the priority and dynasty as the order. It also lists the deeds of famous people of past dynasties and assigns them to various surnames according to the era. It is actually a very good dictionary of Chinese personal names; later, the article "Shangyoulu" by people in the Ming and Qing Dynasties imitated the style of this book. Indexes are still a new type of tool book in China, but the "Shixing Yunbian" in 64 volumes edited by Wang Huizu of the Qing Dynasty is an excellent index of personal names in the Twenty-Four Histories. Even today, it is still an indispensable and important tool for checking official history reporters. However, although the compilation of tool reference books has been quite developed in China in the past, few people can make good use of them. In the past, scholars mostly despised tool books, thinking that everyone could do it and it was not worth calling it writing. For example, Wang Huizu's books on historical tools include "Shixing Yunbian", "Jiushi Tong Xingming Lu", and "Liao Jin Yuan Sanshi Tongming Lu". Not only are the volumes numerous, but also the works are extremely meticulous, but in the Qing Dynasty, few people paid attention to them. Ruan Yuan wrote a biography for the teacher, but called it "Biography of Xunli Wang Jun": Zhang Zhidong wrote a book list and asked questions, and adopted five or six kinds of the teacher's books, but at the end of the volume, the names of Qing Dynasty writers were omitted, which can be seen from this. Since tool books are not valued by general scholars, and those who use them are just some shallow-minded candidates, the compilation and utilization of tool books ultimately cannot create a brilliant atmosphere in the Chinese academic circle.

<h3>Gleanings from Northern Drama</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Published by Commercial Press Preface by Lu Qian Ren Ne</p>
<p>It is said that this is a manuscript copy of the Ming Dynasty collected in Tianyi Pavilion, with a total of twenty-seven suites and fifty-four small orders. Ren Ne's preface said: "Jing Shizhen, Chuweizhe, Xichen, Master of Huxi, is not seen in other books... Mis-entered two suites, "Wuru Tiantai" and "Hutoupai", which are different from those recorded in "Yuanqu Xuan" and can be used for comparison. "Qiaoxiaosheng Duan Jiuse Caiqi" is extremely similar to miscellaneous dramas and has four suites, and the official tunes are different, so it is suspected to be the four suites in one drama. It has not been seen in the past in the list of dramas and still needs to be verified... Seven of the twenty-seven suites are found in Yongxi, which has been slightly collated."</p>
<p>This preface is of a textual research nature, and I will pick out three points from what he said to talk about: 1. Is the collation of Hutoupai precise; 2. Is Jiuse Caiqi the name of a miscellaneous drama: 3. Are there only seven suites seen in Yongxi Yuefu?</p>
<p>Regarding the first point, we should forgive Mr. Ren, because he was only "slightly" collated. However, he pays great attention to the separation and combination of tunes, and it seems that negligence in this aspect should not have occurred. For example, he pointed out that "Beiqu Shiyi" should not combine "Shan Shiliu" and "Zuiniangzi" into one tune, which can be used as proof of his attention to the separation and combination of tunes. However, "Man Jinzhan" originally had six short sentences, and "Beiqu Shiyi" mistakenly titled the last four short sentences as "Hutubai", but Mr. Ren did not point it out. Also, the first song of "Bubaimen" is also titled "Xianggong Ai". "Zuiniangzi" is written as "Zui Ye Mosa" in Yongxi. According to the "Beici Guangzhengpu", the two tunes are actually different. There are several different versions of the collation of the second fold of "Hutoupai", such as "Yuanqu Xuan", "Yongxi Yuefu", "Beici Guangzhengpu", and "Beiqu Shiyi". The most interesting thing is the linked suites. "Beiqu Shiyi" lacks the last "Litingyan Sha" and has the previous "Zaoxiang'er", while the other books lack "Zaoxiang'er" and have "Litingyan Sha". In principle, both should be present. The order of the linked suites attached to the end of the "Beici Guangzhengpu" table of contents is listed below, and the other three books are compared: (Yuan stands for "Yuanqu Xuan", Yong stands for "Yongxi Yuefu", and Bei stands for "Beiqu Shiyi")</p>
<p>Wugongyang Luomeifeng Cheng Xiangci (Bei is Zaoxiang'er, Yuan and Yong have none) Anahuman Jinzhan (Bei is divided into Man Jinsheng and Hutubai) Shizhu Zi Dabaimen Shanshi Qiao (Bei is the same, Yuan and Yong are divided into Shan Shiliu and Zuiniangzi) Xiaobaimen (Bei is the same, Yuan and Yong are divided into Xianggong Ai and Bubaimen) Yebuluo Xiaoxirenxin (Yuan, Yong and Bei are all Xirenxin) Zuiniangzi (Bei is the same, Yuan and Yong are Zui Ye Mosa) Yue'erwan Fengrensong (Yuan, Yong and Bei are all Fengliuguan, the second example of the Fengliu style in Beici Guangzheng is Hutoupai, and it is also called Fengrusong in the table of contents, which is contradictory in itself!) Hutubai Tangwudailitingyan with Xiezhi Sha (Bei has none, Yuan is all Litingyan Shi Sha)</p>
<p>Without paying much attention to this collation in the past, after reading it, I felt that the exotic atmosphere was very strong, and the fresh breath was rushing into my face. For example, the libation is not to the sky, but to "pour the libation facing the sun", how cute is this sentence! Others such as bamboo arrows, thread robes, Cigu flute, leather drums, and even "the silver basin is like Pang'er wearing greasy powder makeup, and the inkstone also has a beard wrapped in velvet rope," all have a special flavor. This is a digression, not to be mentioned.</p>
<p>Regarding the second point, my answer is no. Just look at the tone of these four suites and you can tell that they are completely sung by one person. In Yuanqu, it seems that there is no example of a solo play like Jinghe's "Picking Up Gold". As for using Jiuse Caiqi as a drama, we can see the "Four Great Fools" quoted in Jiao Xun's "Drama Talk" Volume 5: "The Four Great Fools Legend of Landscape Neighbors, the wine fool is Jiang Yingzhao who obtains ill-gotten wealth and then ruins his family with wine; the color fool is Zhuangzi fanning the grave, his wife splitting the coffin; the money fool is about Lou Yuanwai's one penny, and the anger fool is Huang Zai rebelling because he failed the exam. The wine fool is also called Jiu Dong, and was written by Li Fengshi of Wulin. Yi Wen Qian is also engraved in the name of a family miscellaneous drama, called a broken miser. Of course, this has nothing to do with "Qiaoxiaosheng Duan Jiuse Caiqi". The money fool is Yi Wen Qian, which itself has more than six acts, see "Sheng Ming Zaju Chu Ji". The Four Great Fools are probably at least more than twenty acts, which cannot be accommodated in four folds. The editor of "Beiqu Shiyi" seems to like the separate chanting of Jiuse Caiqi, like the author of "Jing Hua Yuan" Li Ruzhen. In the same book, he also copied down four "Chu Duizi" that separately chant Jiuse Caiqi (page 43) and also copied down a "Hui'er Luo" with a first song that chants Jiuse Caiqi in unison, carrying over "De Shenglin" (page 47).</p>
<p>Regarding the third black, I also feel that Mr. Ren is slightly negligent. In addition to the seven suites that he cited (Zhengguan Duanzheng Hao Dadawei, Shangdiao Jixian Shi Shu Huai, Cunli Yagu, Nanlu Yizhilian Hua Zeng Yingguo, Xianlu Dian Jiangchun Jing Shizhen Zuo), and Fulu Yizhilian Hua Jianzu, we can also cite two suites, namely: 1. Page 21, "Jin Dian Xi Chongchong" is seen in Yongxi Yuefu Volume 2, page 37: 2. Page 28, Nanlu Yizhilian Hua, is seen in Yongxi Yuefu Volume 10, page 13. I think there are reasons why Mr. Ren did not see these two suites, namely: 1. In Yongxi Volume 2, he only paid attention to the general title of Zhenggong Duanzheng Hao and did not notice that there was still a part that was not Duanzheng Hao, such as "Jin Dian Xi Chongchong", "Fan Ma Wu Xifeng", "Tuobu Shan", "Yijianmei", "Yuezhao Ting", etc.: 2. Yongxi Volume 8, to Volume 10, these three books are all based on Nanlu Yizhilian Hua, he only checked the sentences with exactly the same first sentence, and thought it was okay if there was no "one year old like one year", but he did not know that "this year old like last year" is a variant of "one year old like one year", so he glanced over it.</p>
<p>Also, Ren Ne's preface claims that "Zaoqi'er" uses Xun Xinqi, but the first song of this tune, "Keng Nuan Chuang Ming Caoshe Di" has already been recorded in Beici Guangzhengpu, and is not very rare.</p>

<h3>Our Oriental New York</h3>
<p>— Jia Wei</p>
<p>This may be something we are very proud and happy about. Our largest city in the country, known as "Oriental New York"—Shanghai—is just thriving! Although the ten-story to twenty-story high-rise buildings are still far from the true New York "skyscrapers" and "soaring pavilions." However, in recent years, the construction of this kind of building, like "bamboo shoots after the rain," is undeniable.</p>
<p>According to a report in the newspaper the other day from Hu Guangshe, "According to news from the Civil Engineering Department of the Public Concession and the French Concession Engineering Bureau, the statistics of construction in the two concessions recently show that the sharp increase in investment in huge buildings is quite alarming. From the second half of last year to the present, there are a total of more than 5,130 large buildings built in the Public Concession. The French Concession is a residential area, and the construction of this new type of building has increased even more sharply. Therefore, according to observations in the construction industry, the completion of Oriental New York is not far away."</p>
<p>However, things cannot be so optimistic. According to a friend who works in a certain national goods company, their company is preparing to open a branch company in a certain department store in the west of the city. The western-style tiled building is quite magnificent. From the first floor to the second floor, it occupies more than a dozen rooms, but it does not need to pay any rent (usually it costs about 600 yuan per month). It is said that the landlord is afraid that "equipment will easily break if it is not used"—"a door hinge does not decay, and flowing water does not stagnate"—so he is willing to make such a generous sacrifice. At the same time, there is a contract for a period of six months. After the expiration of the period, if the company has a profit, it will start to pay the rent.</p>
<p>At first, hearing this kind of thing would make people feel a little strange, but the fact is exactly like this—the atmosphere of "economic downturn" permeates every corner, and no one can deny this. Taking the economic figures of the Public and French Concessions' investment in the construction industry as an example: in 1934, the Public Concession was 35,000,000 yuan, and the French Concession was 16,000,000 yuan. Compared to the 65,287,000 yuan in 1930 (Public) and 18,589,000 yuan (French), the difference is obvious. Moreover, according to the statistics of the Finance Department of the Public Concession Engineering Bureau, the number of vacant houses in a corner of the Public Concession alone increased to more than 6,383 in the summer of last year. (The number in the same period in 1930 was 4,687) If the vacant houses in the French Concession and the Nanshi area are all counted, it is probably no less than 100,000—the investment in the construction industry and the increase and decrease of vacant houses are in inverse proportion—but what about this year?</p>
<p>Now let us excerpt a paragraph from a Shanghai communication published in a certain newspaper in another port: "The Nanjing Road area is the center of the city. Recently, eight or nine out of ten stores have raised the banner of low prices and put up slogans for big sales. Statistics show that there are 18 department stores, 16 silk and satin stores, 7 watch stores, and many other South goods stores, electrical materials, cotton textiles, and leather goods stores. Only a certain incense and candle store next to Taibaosi Temple (ie Hongmiao) does not need to hold low prices due to the increasing number of people who promote superstition in recent years, and it is even overwhelmed with customers. Three or four years ago, it was not easy to rent a house on Nanjing Road for business, and it was necessary to pay a considerable amount of exercise fees. Today, houses for rent are everywhere... The prosperity of the city is gradually declining, which is truly a change of fortune."</p>
<p>Therefore, the sharp increase in huge buildings and structures is only a manifestation of the city's deformed development—the failure of the real estate industry has led entrepreneurs to develop their financial resources towards the "occupying the sky but not the land" high-rise buildings.</p>
<p>The prosperity of our "Oriental New York"—what can I say?</p>
<h3>Mid-Autumn Moon</h3>
<p>— Ling Zixi</p>
<p>(“The crescent moon shines over the nine provinces, some families are happy, some are sorrowful?”)</p>
<p>As usual, once autumn arrives, the azure sky begins to float with reddish-gold, ever-changing clouds; the sky becomes high and clear, the sea becomes vast; withered, powerless leaves, resentfully sobbing, fall to the ground, in the melancholy of twilight, recalling those good old days; in the distance, some intangible sounds vaguely and indistinctly float… Autumn has irrevocably seeped in.</p>
<p>It's already the time when the moon is round; those who have left the metropolis cannot easily imagine the festive scenes on the streets; perhaps there are still many electric lights and people? (However, I heard that "Mid-Autumn" is also a slightly frightening term for people in the metropolis, it's also a checkpoint), perhaps there is also a beautiful moon…?</p>
<p>Yes, it is a "festival," the moon is round, large, and clear, it casts bronze-colored light through sparse branches onto the front of village houses, onto the small village of "Lujiazhai," like an oil-less lamp, gloomy.</p>
<p>What kind of sigh of life rises up! Those families—fifty or so in the small village, after a flood that was finally somewhat milder, in the moonlight as clear and cold as mountain spring water, vaguely recall the outlines of those good years: autumn, the season of results and harvests, the fragrant rice ears that have ripened, the reward for a year's labor before their eyes, the lovely moon on Mid-Autumn Festival night, folk legends, folk customs and festive scenes, mooncakes, incense holders, piles of food, children's laughter, adults' laughter…</p>
<p>A whole pile! The scene of good years, but all of this is already past, and will never come again.</p>
<p>The elderly sigh, a wave of unbearable hunger surges up, they don't even have the chance to remember the "each generation is worse than the last" curses: Now it is just a village where all crops, all livestock, and the silent land have been soaked by the flood. After the water recedes, they struggle desperately to return from a life worse than that of dogs (because it is: "Even if we die, we must die at home!"). Look, it is already: losing their homes, losing acquaintances, losing the basis for survival, the village has become just a pile of wasteland, and people can only cling to their hometown, and wait for a dreamlike destruction: to die at home.</p>
<p>What they still remember: is that it is "Mid-Autumn," and there is such a good moon, remembering the days of the past, remembering the scattered and deceased family members, remembering another world illuminated by the same moon, a world of lewdness and intoxicated pleasure, those "happy people!"</p>
<p>(How many people are hungry, so resentful and angry. So…)</p>
<p>The people of Lujiazhuang, dying, even hate the moon on this Mid-Autumn night. To put on a charming face in the face of disaster is simply malicious, shameless boasting, it is an insult!</p>
<p>It is such a season of the autumn moon, the mood of people is withering away in sorrow and hunger, just like withered leaves. The surroundings are so deathly still. In the mud, on the four walls of the houses, there is still heavy dampness, the unpleasant smell of water, the rotting smell of plants and soil. The world is so gloomy! The leaves fall softly, many unknown insect sounds ring chaotically, however, the sighs of people are silent: so subtle, so calm.</p>
<p>The moon, plump and full, shining from the city, seems so arrogant! It only knows to seek the joy of the nine provinces in beautiful smiling faces; and it does not have the courage to explore how many families in the world are in sorrow.</p>
<h3>Old Tea Drinkers</h3>
<p>— Hu Weinan</p>
<p>Three years ago, I was unemployed, and after being turned away everywhere, I passively went to teahouses every day to get through those long, tangled days.</p>
<p>The teahouse was in a narrow alley. If there wasn't a steamed bun stall at the front of the building, you might have to ask someone every day to find it. It had neither a sign like the ×× Teahouse, nor did it do a book-telling side business at night like the small teahouses next door, with a red banner advertising a specially invited ballad singer. As for how I discovered that teahouse and became a regular there for several months, I really can't remember that chance encounter.</p>
<p>There were only a few tea drinkers in that teahouse every day, each occupying a broken rattan chair and seeing the midday sun off to the western mountains. They were all elderly, and you could see from their eyes that they had been tempered by all kinds of environments, and now they were like old oxen abandoned in that corner. --That teahouse resembling an ancient tomb. They all sat silently, not wanting to exchange a word, for fear that it would break the air of that quiet and secluded nest. Even the few who mumbled over illustrated booklets kept their voices as soft as mosquitoes, finding a little pleasure in them with their remaining energy. Even more were those who sat all day like meditating old monks, holding dry tobacco pipes, one bag after another. So when I, such a young lad, first stepped into that teahouse, it caused them great surprise, and for several days, those almost arrow-like gazes gathered on me. But before ten days had passed, the teahouse returned to its usual calm. They didn't seem to think that the addition of a new young tea drinker would cause any trouble. Every day I brought the books and newspapers I liked to read, buried my head, drank bitter tea, and let myself suffer a little unwarranted torment.</p>
<p>One rainy day, only I and an old tea drinker in the next seat came to the teahouse. When the tea server, who was missing two front teeth, came to pour hot water, he sighed, "Heaven really doesn't care for the poor!" At the same time, he sat down on the side, perhaps hoping that his words would spark a conversation between us. Outside the window, it was raining heavily. If everyone continued to sit silently in the dim tea seat, it would seem like a kind of terror was about to strike. And so, the old man interjected: "The times are getting worse year by year!"</p>
<p>He shook his head, knocked out the embers from his tobacco pipe, and cast a pair of experienced eyes over, as if seeking my opinion. My heart was like a warehouse, full of grievances that I wanted to find an opponent to pour out. But in such a situation, I still maintained my attitude, only exchanging his gaze as if I understood his meaning.</p>
<p>"Young man, what do you say?"</p>
<p>The old man, seeing that I didn't answer, pressed me further. The tea server also raised his head, waiting for our conversation to break the dullness before the deathly silence. Thus, we started talking about everything under the sun.</p>
<p>The old man had once roamed all over the country alone. He wasn't like the average old person, clinging to the "old days," but he was too disappointed with everything in the "present." He hoped that we young people should be brave enough to take on this important responsibility.</p>
<p>"But I have knocked on so many doors of hope, and nowhere can accommodate this large group of ambitious young people!"</p>
<p>It seemed as if he was the opponent I had been hoping for, and I poured out the grievances that had been suppressed in my chest before him.</p>
<p>"But you young people always have hope," he comforted me like that.</p>
<p>After that, the two of us were an exception in that teahouse. Although the age difference was so great, our opinions were consistent in the discussion of every matter. I was very fortunate to have found a friend of a different generation in such a small environment.</p>
<p>Since finding a job and being busy with the whip of life, I could no longer go to the teahouse to meet him. It's been a full three years now. Yesterday, I happened to pass by that teahouse. I was very happy to go up and wanted to meet him, but his seat had been taken by another person, and almost all the tea drinkers were unfamiliar faces. I asked the tea server, and he said that the old man had died more than half a year ago!</p>
<p>On the way home, I silently recited, "You young people always have hope," and almost wanted to abandon my current job!</p>

<p>Topic: Zhuangzi's "Free and Easy Wandering" (6)</p>
<p>I have always observed the use of poetry in the Spring and Autumn period. Poetry arose from events, not altering the events to fit the poetry. Events were gathered into the poetry, not altering the poetry to fit the events. The meaning was conveyed within the minutiae of the key points, the traces were omitted beyond the mare, the stallion, the black, and the yellow. Taking excerpts and interpreting them could lead to a divine encounter, but could not be sought through words. The petty and ignorant Confucian scholars who painstakingly explained and annotated the texts all failed at this point. Such was the skill of those who used poetry well in the Spring and Autumn period. Burned by Qin, mixed up by Han, differentiated in Qi and Lu, stirred up with apocryphal texts, confused by the Five Phases, narrowed by specialization, analyzed by the smallest weight, compared by the smallest inch. How could there be poetry left? Alas! Where can I find someone who understands the Spring and Autumn period's method of using poetry to tell them about this?</p>

<p>Opening Chapter "Heartbroken Lyrics"</p>
<p>The autumn wind is lonely and falls in disorder, the cuckoo is silent and dusk is here again. I push open the moonlit window alone, the fishing lights in the river illuminate the sorrowful man. The lake water is flowing leisurely, the heart is anxious, the lonely boat is quiet and follows the riverbank. All kinds of sorrows rise from the heart, and I try to express the sorrow in my heart. People are quiet, the night is dark, the moonlight is muddy and as white as silver, Chang'e seems to know that people are frustrated, and the reunion shines on my widowed body. Recalling the past, Zhou Qing and I were in love, and we were diligent before the flowers and under the moon. She loved me, and I loved her, leaning on the lotus pond railing and singing together. I remember the two of us saying, "The sea may dry up and the rocks may rot, but our hearts will never leave." I really hoped to ride the dragon and cross the phoenix to reach Wushan, to be inseparable in life and death, but I didn't expect a violent wind to rise from the ground, blowing out the wedding candles and overturning the flower vows. And now, the fragrance has disappeared and the jade has fallen, and you have gone, Qing, and who can I tell my full of sorrow to? Fortunately, I have only tears in my eyes all year round, and I have grown thin, with a life as insignificant as my body. It is Wu Qiong's merciless emotion. Why did she especially envy her treasure hairpin skirt? I cry out, "Heaven! Heaven! Heaven! Since you gave birth to people, why give birth to hatred? Since you gave birth to hatred, why give birth to people?" Is it not that the heavenly father intentionally invades people? Is it not that five hundred years of debt have been settled in this life? Is it not that she dislikes me for being infatuated and thin, or is it not that she loves Huangpi herself and is quiet? I only wish to end the turbid world, and be alone to accompany Qing Qing. Tonight, when will I see you when I cry? The loess will bury the beautiful body for a long time. My intestines turn a few times and break inch by inch, my tearful eyes look at the jade woman's grave again, and I sincerely bow and tell my feelings, and when I look back, I see the sun rising in the east, but I hear the cuckoo singing sadly.</p>

<h3>Silver Jottings</h3>
<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>Some people say that Xu Lai is a "good person," and at first I always couldn't believe it. Recently, I saw her conversation with people in a certain newspaper, saying: "I seem to have had a dream. Those who praised me praised me up to the thirty-third heaven; those who suppressed me suppressed me into the eighteenth level of hell, but I was confused and didn't feel anything."</p>
<p>So, I believe that the saying that Xu Lai is a "good person" is not false.</p>
<p>Although Xu Lai is said to be a "good person," she is not enough to be called a "standard good person," because although she is "confused and doesn't feel anything," she still knows about being praised up to the thirty-third heaven and being suppressed into the eighteenth level of hell.</p>
<p>If Xu Lai is a "good person," then Diao Gongbanhua, who is called a "photo star," should also be called a "good person," or at least, should be called half a good person.</p>
<p>On the day "Big Family" was screened, because there were stars singing on stage, the tickets were sold out before 1:00 PM.</p>
<p>Alas, the value of stars.</p>
<h3>Casual Talk About "Big Family"</h3>
<p>"Big Family" was released on the evening of the 5th, and the tickets for the 6th were sold out, breaking the new record for box office sales in the film market this year.</p>
<p>In "Big Family," there are all kinds of monsters and gods, strange and bizarre things. Brothers suspect each other, sisters-in-law are jealous of each other, and the film fully portrays the various aspects of feudal society.</p>
<p>When the female stars took the stage, the audience cheered like thunder. When they started singing, there was silence. The singing programs included Hu Die's "Night Fragrance," Xu Lai's "The First Remember," Ye Qiuxin's "Falling Flowers and Flowing Water," Zhu Qiuhen's "Enjoying the Moment," and Gu Lanjun's "Coming Down from Qiong Lou," etc.</p>
<p>After the public screening of "Big Family," Wang Xianzai's "bad egg" character will surely become a "good egg," because when the scene of Wang Xianzai being deceived was shown on the screen, most of the audience had already let out sighs.</p>
<p>The roles of the thirty or so main actors are all developed equally. With this alone, the director has put in a lot of effort.</p>
<p>In the ending of "Big Family," the eldest, the second, and the third all died unnatural deaths. In front of the family hall, three memorial tablets were hung together, which was extremely tragic, and the audience shed tears of sympathy.</p>
<p>Old Gao and Xiao Gao are a happy couple here. Xiao Gao's control of Old Gao is no less than that of the "female hero" in the "Daughter's Classic," and she certainly does not lose Xiao Gao's true colors.</p>
<h3>Jincheng Opens "Four Sisters"</h3>
<p>"Four Sisters" is the latest joint production by the Liang sisters from Lianhua. The Liang sisters put a lot of effort into the film, each playing a different personality, all of which were just right, lifelike, and everyone had a role to play, each showing their skills, which was very lively. The plot was also extremely tragic and stubborn, telling the story of the life of a family of four sisters. The eldest sister was filial and obedient and sold her virginity to save her father. The second sister was weak-willed and was deceived by others because she admired prosperity, and finally repented. The third sister was infatuated, and the fourth sister was lively and innocent. There is a song in the film sung by the four Liang sisters together, which was created by Ren Guang and An E, the authors of "Fisherman's Song." The lyrics and melody are beautiful and intoxicating to listen to. The film will be publicly screened at the Jincheng Grand Theater starting today.</p>

<h3>Oriental Theater Troupe Seeks Members</h3>
<p>Mr. Ren Pengnian, the manager of Yueming Film Company, believes that the rise of the drama movement has a great impact on sound films. In order to cultivate new drama talents for the production of large-scale sound films, he has specially hired drama directors Ding Wanlai and Jinshan to organize the Oriental Theater Troupe, which was officially established on September 1st. The troupe is now openly recruiting members and does not charge registration fees or any other fees. The troupe will provide food and lodging and has hired a dozen experts to set up lectures. Anyone who has received secondary education or above and is in good health can apply. The application period ends on the 20th. Within the period, you can send an application form, resume, and a full-length and half-length photo to the troupe. A detailed reply will be sent. A prospectus is also available and will be sent upon request. The address is Yueming Film Company, No. 855, Bottom of Haige Road, Xiafei Road.</p>
