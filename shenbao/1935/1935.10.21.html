<p>（羅馬）首相墨索里尼、昨日與英國大使德魯蒙爵士談話情形、頃據發表公報稱、一德魯蒙爵士再度向首相提出保證、謂英國對於意阿爭端、係以國聯會忠實會員國資格、担　集體義務、除內履行此項義務所採取之行動、曁國聯會依照盟約所建議之行動而外、英國不願單獨有所舉動、幷謂英國對於意阿爭端所採立塲、實與本國利益不相牽涉」云云、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（羅馬）據官塲人士官稱、英國大使德魯蒙爵士、昨向墨索里尼首相解釋英國態度之後、意國政府人民、均表示滿意、相信此後兩國亦能較為諒解、蓋德魯蒙拜訪目的、係在澄淸地中海之形勢、現則該處局勢確已較為緩和也，英意兩國現將賡續舉行談話、官場人士以為德魯蒙爵士昨日未必提出切實建議、但雙方已有成立解决辦法之可能云、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（日內瓦）五十二人制裁調整委員會昨開全體會議、在寗靜討論之空氣中成立普鶣抵制意貨之重要決議、其所採行之步驟如下、（一）通過英代表艾登抵制意國輸出品之建議、（一）一致贊助關於互助委員會的組織之建議、（三）通過禁止若干物品輸入意國之建議、禁品名冊、當塲通過、奧匈兩國對於第一條建議放棄票决權、而對於第三條建議不願投票者、除奧匈外、尚有阿爾巴尼亞國、奧匈代表皆重伸其反對制裁故不投票之理由、其所根據者、為經濟上之損害、但五十二人委員會範圍廣大之决議經過奧匈之反對、大可表示國際團結力、其最要特點、厥為自己犧牲之志願與精神、一般小國亦咸具此志願、秉此精神、準備接受因制裁而起之損失、此項决議在意國方面、當有使其惶擾之效力、雖制裁實際上之影饗、今尚未可豫言、但精神上之影饗、定非細微、蘇俄代表李維諾夫發表重要言論、謂蘇俄對意貿易、處於出超優勢、然準備遭受損失、以履行其義務、不過其他各國亦須遵守此義務耳、如例外舉動使制裁無效、則蘇俄將不得不重行考慮全盤地位、而作新的决定云、非會員國參加對意制裁之問題、復由該委員會舉行非公開會議討論之、主席聲稱、時常縈懷而迄未解决之甚靈要問題、厥為非會員國之地位、渠請非會員國以道德之觀念、維護法律勝過武力之尊嚴、並防止國際生活中之侵略、彼等雖非會員國、然固巴黎非戰公約之簽字國也、國聯應將其處理意阿爭議的行為與建議詳告各非會員國而請其表示意見、渠以為此其時矣、吾人建議能為共同目的服務達何種程度、非會員國應如何採取與吾人同樣之行為以期合作、此種問題、吾人唯有任各非會員國憑天良以決定之云、午後制裁調整委員會開會時、奧匈態度大爲衆所抨擊、羅馬尼亞代表蒂杜萊斯科激昻發言、謂宜取締此兩國之輸入品、以為不遵行制裁者戒云、旋言及最惠國待遇條文事、辯論甚烈、但後決定在其決議案文中不言及非會員國、互相委員會昨日集議、其報告書有一可注意之特點、卽決定不使奧匈兩國因此兩國輸入逾恒、應使之負責、卽在輸出方面、亦應使之與參加制裁國受同樣程度之損失、制裁調整委員會下屆會議、將於十月三十一日舉行、屆時將决定制裁實施之日期、（二十日路透電）</p>

<p>（日內瓦）制裁方案調整委員會、頃通過决議案、决定依照約盟第十六條第三項採取互助辦法、其全文如下、國聯會各會員國政府、應在現行義務之下、考慮各項措置、</p>
<p>（一）應以各項適宜手段、增加各該國之淮口數額、籍令國參加制裁以致損失員國市塲之各國、獲得利益、（二）若干會　國、或不參加制裁、並因其他會員國實施制裁而獲有和益者、各會員國應將此等國家所當担負之互助義務、與所獲利益、互相對照、而在合理範圍之內、採取適宜手段、以减少此等國家進口貨物數額、以資抵銷、（三）參加制裁各國應設法鼓勵、使平時專事對意輸出某種貨物之公司、因制裁而受損失者、與平時專事輸入此類貨物之公司增加相互之貿易、（四）參加制裁各國、應會同組織國察貿易制度、用以抵補因參加制裁而喪失意國市塲之損失、（五）貿易上所採措置、若不能在互助上發生相當效果、則參加制裁各國、應考慮採取財政措置之可能性、</p>
<p>調整委員會嗣又通過羅馬尼亞代表蒂杜萊斯哥所提出之建議、决定對於會員國、拒絕參加對意制裁者、卽奧匈兩國實施特別制裁辦法、蒂氏此項提議、曾由英俄小協商巴爾幹協商各國、加以贊助、經濟互助股員會席康都斯（西班牙）嘗發表宣言云、「國聯會因保障國際法律所採取之措置　各非會員國有予以便利或减削其效力之權力」、此言係針對日本·美國·巴西·德國·四非會員國而發、康氏因各該國係屬非戰公約簽字國、乃建議國聯會、得將工作結果及各項决議案況文、抄送各該國政府各該國對於制裁問題、若認為有提用意見之必要、則請通知本人云、此項建議、經由調整委員會通過、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>十八國小組延會</p>
<p>（日內瓦）十八國小糾委員會宣告延會、至十月二十一日後、英俄兩國代表團發言人、均向本社訪員發表談話云、「英法兩國合作與歐洲和平、實有密切關係」、英國代表團發言人並表示希望英法兩國相合作、能使國聯會盟約獲得完全勝利「反之英法兩國若不能合作、則英國不擬單獨有所行動、而以置身事外為得計、其影響之重大、恐非意料所可及矣」云云、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>意表示不足惶懼</p>
<p>（羅馬）半官式意大利日報稱、意大利對於經濟制裁、饒有抵拒能力、「一九三四年度、意國向日本巴西·美·德四國所購進貨物、已在進口總額百分之三十以上、至由奧匈兩國購進之貨物、則為進口總額百分之三·七、日·巴·美·德·四國均非國　會會員國、一俟經濟制裁實行之後、其所供給意國之貨物、必能有所增多、其中意國所需之煤、德國輸入約佔百分之四十、英國則為百分之三十九」、該報又謂一九三四年度意國輸入工業品、共值一·五四一·〇〇〇·〇〇〇里拉、現擬停止購進、而以國貨代之、意國正積極研究新製造法云云、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>意銀行存金減少</p>
<p>（羅馬）自上月三十日起至本月十日止、意大利國家銀行存金减少二二六·〇〇〇·〇〇〇里拉、而至四·〇二五·三五四·〇〇〇里拉、外幣存額則由三九二·五三三·〇〇〇里拉、加至四一二·六四四·〇〇〇里拉、紙幣流通額由一五二七一·七一六·〇〇〇里拉、加至一五·四二五·五一〇·〇〇〇里拉、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>美國態度待考慮</p>
<p>（華盛頓）據國務院人員今日宣稱、俟國聯中請非會員國一律抵制意貨之公文送到後、美政府卽將考慮對付此舉之態度、惟諸員之意、美國現無法律可援、以禁止意貨人口、按照中立法、任何取締商業條例必須施諸兩交戰國、但阿國與美之貿易為數至微此項條例已足使意國受重大之影響云、（二十日路透電）</p>

<h3 id="c11">歡迎美國陸軍總長竇恩氏 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>美國政府以菲列賓自治政府於十一月十五日正式成立。遠東關係。又進至一新時期。國會方面及總統方面。均派最高領袖。親臨馬尼拉參加。陸軍總長竇恩氏於本日到滬。明日將晋京謁吾政府各領袖。繼氏而東來者。尚有前參謀總長麥克亞述將軍。副總統兼參院議長。嘉納氏。衆院議長及國會民主黨之領袖多人。竇恩氏來滬以前。曾在日本作數日之勾留。彼邦政府領袖。朝野名人。與氏均有多度之酬酢。際此中日英美諸國關係有新的展開。而遠東各問題亟項得一總解决之時。負美國國防之重責。司菲列賓羣島之管理權之陸軍總長。親自渡海東來。交換意見。於此困難局面。定有重要之貢獻。而乘此機會。一覩新中國建設之成績。了解新中國國民之願望。於素稱親善之中美二國之友誼。必更有裨益。此吾人於竇恩氏。所以表示至誠之歡迎者也。蓋就竇恩氏所司之職務而言。於遠東問題。當有深切了解與積極之努力。美國陸軍總長雖為文人。然據法律規定。乃負執行一九二〇年國防法案全部責任。及掌理菲列賓羣島及頗多利加島內政之權。美國陸軍部所司職務。性質至為紛歧。自軍事敎育。作戰計書。海岸防務。防空工作。軍法軍需。以至於水利工程。巴拿馬運河區之統治等。均隸於陸軍部。各項職務雖。有參謀部長總工程師。屬地總督等。分別負責。然陸軍總長乃總其大成。監督其執行者。菲列賓羣島。為美國國防鎖鏈中最弱之一環。人盡知之。自治以後。十年以內。美國於其內政。已喪失大部分之干涉權利。於其防務。尚負全責。蓋美國之國旗未下。而美國之軍港猶存在於馬尼拉也。使菲島對內對外。有不幸之事發生。則事涉於美國全部國防計畫。司軍政者不但思防敵之侵入。更項防戰爭之發生於未然。而如何使菲島不致成為東亞之火藥庫。如何使東亞和平稍得穩固之基礎。則秉國鈞者所宜注意。而吾人相信竇恩氏考察晤談結果。必有所貢獻也。</p>
<p>其次。就竇恩氏之生平而言。彼於中國之白銀問題。當有深刻之了解與積極之貢獻。氏生於六十三年前。求學於西部奈伯來斯加大學。年方二十三齡。卽從事於開礦事業。二十年間。歷任柔達省之金鑛經理。至一九一五年。始入宦途。曾為該省之省長八年。柔達省者。白銀礦之中心區域。血國會中白銀議員金氏及湯姆期等。均出是省。銀派議員。但知白銀之增價。可以使銀礦資本家與銀礦區域之人民。得到暫時之利益。而於購銀政策在海外所種之毒。則往往置之不顧。竇恩氏於銀鑛區域人民之願望。已充分了解。於中國國民對於美國銀政策所引起之惡感。當可藉此行之便。而得精確之印象與認識也。白銀政策。使中國經濟秩序動搖。使中美關係發生可惋惜之現象。竇恩氏為羅斯福總就之最親信之人。亦民中黨最有力領袖之一。當知有所建議。使美國之外交政策。與經濟政策國防方案與對外貿易方案。取得調和也。</p>
<p>今遠東形勢。頗形嚴盧。美國或進或退。無猶豫之可能。意阿之戰爆發後。汕頭漢口一帶已發生可驚之事。而觀乎美國兵艦之開往油頭。可知遠東有事。美國欲完全避免捲入。乃不可能。防大患於未然。乃政治家之可貴之所在。吾國國民於歡迎竇恩氏來華之日敢申此願。不知賢明之上賓。以為何如耶。</p>

<h3 id="c83">國際貿易局發表　本年對外貿易狀況　上半年留易額計八萬萬餘元　較往年同期減落約百分之四 <a href="#c83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>新新社云、據國際貿易局長何炳賢發表、本年對外貿易、仍趨衰落、惟未見大减，就貿易總額觀、第一季計三八九·八一八·八九二元、第三季略增、計四一五·零零六。零七七元、上半年合計為八零八·八二四·九六八元、較往年同期、减落百份之四、各情分誌如次、</p>
<p>前六個月　貿易情形　本年前六個月對外貿易、與上年同期比較、出口方面第一季似較良好、一二兩月各超過上年同期百分之八或九　二月份則等於百分之九七·三四、第二季則見退步、除四月份超過上年同月極微外、五六兩月、均不過等於上年同月百分之八十二三、入口方面、適與出口不局、第一季各月均不及往年同月、第二季各月則均超過往年同月、最高如六月份且超過百分之六·一一、蓋係本年度米糧輸入激增所致、總額方面、除四月份外、各月均較上年同期下落、至與貿易平衡相關之金銀輸出入問題、本年上半年、因政府種種限制白銀輸出方法之實行、以及外資流入之結果、白銀在輸出方面、不僅已較往年同期突减百分之九十二、而在輸入方面、更較往年數值增加二百七十萬元、至於生金與金幣、進口值十一萬二千餘金單位、出口值一千三百九十六萬九千餘金單位、較往年同期亦見减少、</p>
<p>貿易數值　折金變動　惟就折金數字觀察、則情勢大不相同、無論進出口貿易多較往年同期增加、出口之美金値仍以一月份仍最高計一千九百零七萬餘金元、二三兩月最少、亦達一千四百餘萬金元、與往年同期出口折金值此較、無不均見增加、入口方面之美金值、以四五兩月份為最多、各計三千九百餘萬金元、二月份為最少、亦達二千四百零九萬餘金元、與往年同期比較、除一二兩月較减百分之十五外、其餘各月、均見增加、六月份且增百分之三〇之多、至於總額方面、情形亦大致相同、本年折金數之所以超過目年同期、其最大原因、自係銀價上漲、上年同期國幣折金比率、最高為〇·三四二九〇、本年銀價漲風堅俏、國幣每元折合美金由一月之二角四分循序增至六月份之四角、於是本年上半期、我國之對外貿易數值、在從銀方商計算、出口减落之程度、較低於進口、出口减少百分之，二、入口减少百分之四、但從折金計算、則進口增加之程度則相等於出口、計出口增加百分之一〇、進口增加百分之九·五、銀價之變遷、與貿易數值爾係之密切、由此可見、</p>
<p>本年上期　入超數值　本年上半年八超、共計二億八千六百零八萬五千六百二十二元、較之上年同其减少一千五百二十一萬九千餘元、上半年入超數字所以較少之緣故、乃由於本年第一季入口貿易减退所致、總計本年第一季之入超額、為一億一千八百餘萬元、較往年同期减少不下四千萬元、惟第二季因米榖輸入之激增、入超額遂達一億六千七百餘萬元、反較往年同期增加二千五百萬餘元、否則本年上半年之入超額、當更見减落、若就各月入超額在入口總額所佔百分比觀察、則本年上半年對外貿易平衡之情况、固未較往年同期良好、往年同期、平均每月入超額佔入口總額百分之五二·八七、本年亦佔五二·四五、其最高如三四兩月、竟佔百分之五九·八七以上、為往年同期所未見者、幸在一二兩月間出口旺盛、於是入超額祗佔該月人口總值百分之三十七八、否則本年上半年入超額在在人口總額中所佔之百分比、又須近民國二十二年上半期之最高峯（百分之六一）矣、</p>

<p>限制設廠　推廣市場　洋商在華設廠、向係根據昔時所訂之通商條約、廠址多設在我國政令不行之租界內、又因廉價僱用華工、利用我國廉價原料、就地銷售、因此國內火柴業、外受外商傾軋、爲保護產業起見、我國應頒布限制外商設廠辦法、必須過登記及嚴格審察後、方準設立、以資限制、據專家估計、國貨火柴每年可產百尤箱、但國內銷費量不及七十萬箱、故欲謀產銷平衡、必須廣銷路、發展國外市塲、</p>
<p>減進口稅　大部火柴原料、我國已能自給、惟其中赤燐·綠酸硫黃·白蠟油、數種尚須仰給舶來品、我政府亟應審察情形、核减稅率、並取銷手續費、使華商成本减輕、銷路得以推廣、此外凡外商火柴售價廉於成本者、應課以傾銷稅、</p>

<p>甲央社云、此次全運會開幕、以觀衆人數之衆多、故交通之不易管理、早為一般人所預料、雖經大會交通股長張登義苦心調度、祗以車輛擁擠、指揮不易、如出租汽車停車塲離大會前門較遠、及各路公共汽車、以兜攪生意過額裝載、而致覆車傷人、均為一般市民所不滿、詎大會最後一日、閘北公共汽車司機及市辦公共汽車司機、雙方因兜客而發生流血慘劇、尤為不幸、茲錄其詳悄如下、</p>
<p>慘劇起因　自大會開幕後、交通委員會議决調派市辦公共汽車三十輛維持大會交通、並指定北四川路虬江路為市辦公共汽車搭客站、寶山路虬江路為華商公共汽車搭客站、以免雙方因兜攬乘客發生糾紛、詎大會開幕後、北四川路虬江路乘客較少、市辦公共汽車以寶山路乘客擁擠、乃移至同一地址停靠車輛、於是因乘客之兜攪而互有齟齬、此　慘劇發生之原因一、市辦公共汽車車身較大、坐位優適、且係市辦、故一般司機、對於速率之限制、每易忽視、而中途又喜追趕其他車輔、以博乘客之歡心、於是其他車輛咸生嫉視、此則尤為釀成雙方司機互毆之第二原因、</p>
<p>慘劇經過　昨日上午十時三十分、市辦公共汽車司機三一四號、在寶山路虬江路口、以兜攬乘客與華商汽車司機人發生齟齬、當有市辦公共汽車管理處處長金保賢帶同司機五六人上前勸阻、以言語上之衝突、遂致引起互毆、市辦公共汽車方面司機陳某曁胡金僕當塲被毆、不能行走立送醫院急救、雨人生命、非常危險、處長金保賢頭部被擊重傷、華商公共汽車方面、售票樊公餘、重傷頭部、有刀痕長七寸、恐有性命之憂、查票鮑士林、傷腰部頗重、查票梁國明、傷眼目手足、查票陳效平、腿骨折損、司機輕傷者六七人、該處為中心區必經之地秩序紛亂、達半小時之久、經公安分局派來大批警士、極力鎭壓、始告平息、然雙方司機、各尤怒氣未息也、</p>
<p>二次慘劇　第一次慘劇、雖經警士鎭壓、然雙方司機、餘怒未息、華商汽車公司司機二十餘人、乃乘客車一輛、於東體育路附近、攪住市辦公共汽車二輛、將司機售票拖下痛毆、一時車上乘客、紛紛跳車逃避、致有擦傷皮膚者多人、旋因市辦公共汽車一零二三號由後趕上、司機售票亦下車援助、以致愈聚愈衆、相與混戰、幸經大會警衛隊聞警趕至、始各逃散、聞市辦公共汽車管理重傷售票一二三號及一五二號、又司機王阿毛傷在腰間、亦有性命之憂，當經主管人員、用救護車送同仁醫院醫治、</p>

<p>— （醉樵）</p>
<p>良心好比是一面鏡子，但它有時會被灰塵落在上面，而失去它原有光澤的；如果在我們照着它的時候，發覺鏡子糢糊不淸，映出影子，是那麼暗淡，那必要用乾布將它拂拭淸楚，而後現出面容上的光彩：那就是人把良心受着　備，懺悔自新的一日了。</p>
<p>的確，自己看不出自己是一副怎樣的面孔，於是對着鏡子，就可明明朗朗，看出自己的影子，我怒亦怒，我喜亦喜，但是丟下鏡子，自己又認不得自己了。所以社會上有許多罪惡的人，面目猙獰，做着傷天害理的事，而不自覺，這都由於他們不肯去照鏡子，甚至連鏡子也不知是何物！然而他們的結果，是逃不出法律的羅網，這樣反而形成了社會上前車之鑒的明競。</p>
<p>雖然，偌大的借鏡，高掛在社會裏，但是人們都好像是亮眼瞎子，看不見它，於是社會中的惡潮，終於在澎湃着！</p>
<p>靑年們：我們在進行的大路上，要每人手執一商鏡子，刻刻照着，才不會有失足之恨。</p>

<p>— 茱英</p>
<p>近見澳洲維多里亞日報，登着一篇旅滬多年的勞里愛羅氏，在請假回澳時，所寫的一篇短文，替「上海」說出一番眞面目來。</p>
<p>他說：！</p>
<p>在影片裏，，小說裏，時常把「黃浦江濱的巴黎」，寫成了一個不可思議的都市，充滿着奢侈，富饒，淫亂，甚而至於熱帶風味的描寫。這些，眞可使到過上海的人嚇一跳。這些，或許還是帆船時代，在離上海很遠的所在的旅行者所得的印象。</p>
<p>現代的上海，不是影片，小說，或戲劇中的上海了。上海眞比了倫敦還淸潔，上海的生活，也遠不如一般傳說的高貴，比了倫敦和紐約，還是低廉。為甚麼大家都說上海的生活程度，高得怕人，我想，大致回國的僑民，在回國之前，都攢聚着幾個錢，而在假期中，一樣的支着薪，於是乎一副闊綽的塲面，便引起了一般人的誤會了。</p>
<p>在上海，要找尋職業，這年頭兒，也不是容易的一回事。雖然有少數的僑民，漂流到上海，而找到了職業，可是大多數的僑民，都是垂頭喪氣，一聲不響，而離開上海的。</p>
<p>許多影片和小說中，有把上海描成執帶背景的，這眞是一個笑話。上海的氣候，眞是可愛之至。雖然上海也有寒冷的冬天，炎熱的夏天，但從十月到十二月的那個時期中的氣候的佳良，幾乎可說是世界上任何一個大都市，都休想比得上。</p>

<p>— 高吉安</p>
<p>記得去年秋天，在由長崎赴東京的途中，當過門司海峽的渡輪上邂逅着一個在京都的影星，伊是叫中島雪子，可沒有把假名字告訴我，長長的臉兒，瘦小的身材是一個十足洋化的麗人</p>
<p>有女同車在赴東京的悠長的鐵道上，話可多了，上下古今中外無所不談，伊告訴我伊是東京人，伊的父親是一個實業家，媽媽巳經死了，父親還在東京，這次因為父親有病，所以特地放棄了在雲仙拍外景的辰光，而趕去探病的。</p>
<p>我的希望是都斷絕的了，我只愛老母親的，爸爸呢，雖然也好，但是一個酒徒，他只忠於他的業務，對於我似乎是無甚懷念其母親在世的當兒，也是愛伊無所不至的，但伊死了。住東京的家又冷靜得慌，因為我愛好着電影，所以我也就在京都住了……高先生！你還有爸朴媽嗎？</p>
<p>「我是一個也不缺，他們都安好着」。</p>
<p>「有媽的人多幸福呵，這次你打算從東京歸去就要去見你的媽嗎？」</p>
<p>一當然的，伊是在懷念着在外旅行着的兒子的；</p>
<p>秋片黃葉的道上，車兒在東海道本綫走着很輕捷過了大阪伊又指着大阪的站又說：「大阪的旁邊有一處叫寶塚，媽是那見的人，我固無日不在懷念着媽的。」</p>
<p>伊對文學也很有研究，武者小路實篤，菊池寬，等都很熟悉，我們是談得很投機，對伊的失去了媽的事也盡力的安慰，固然，日本型的賢妻良母是值得女見永　的懷念的。</p>
<p>過後，在東京，伊也來帝國飯店看過我，據說伊父親病也好了，來約我去玩所以我也在匆忙的應酬期中分出了一些時間同伊上日光去了一次，第二天伊便回京都，並且對我說，要我在回程中去京都留一些時候。</p>
<p>因為東京實在煩透，事悄都在藝妓院裏的酒後辦，生魚也吃得發了恨，銘酒玉園，初戀史是覺得一陣陣的松香氣，稍稍一點舒寬，立刻跑了，車到橫濱時節，就打電報去，第二天早晨，富士號特急列車進京都驛時，雪子已在候我，立刻要我到伊家去，沒法，只好順從着，到家後第一伴事伊給我看伊和媽媽的照片。</p>
<p>二天後我走了，並且約伊再見的期間，也告訴伊我上海的地址，回來後，間或的也通幾封信了。</p>
<p>凉秋又來到了人問，凄寂的冬夜，雪子又在懷念着伊的媽吧！</p>

<p>伊雖然並不曾得意忘形的歌唱起來，但伊所發的聲音裏，的確已有一種微帶顫動的樂聲在響着了；祗為上天賦給了伊這樣一個超越的地位，以致使伊隨時隨地都不敢再忽略伊肖己所應有的尊嚴，竟連歌唱的自由也失去了，否則我想伊是一定會在浴盆內低吟一曲的！</p>
<p>說到尊嚴，太后自然有伊的尊嚴的！卽使在洗澡的時候，裸着身子，赤條條地的呈露在五個女人的面前，伊的尊嚴還是不稍變動的；正和伊當每天早朝的時候，高坐在龍椅上，讓許多翎頂輝煌的王公大臣，一批一批的在殿前的丹　上給伊恭而敬之地叩頭時一般無二。無論伊穿得怎樣富麗嚴，或是在上床前穿得那樣俏皮單薄，但伊的尊嚴是始終極充分地保持着的；從頭至足，沒有一寸不足以代表一個至高無上的皇太后。然而當伊沒有做皇太后之前，畢竟也是一個普通的女性！</p>
<p>讀者想來總還不曾忘記伊在奉天的古宮內檢視歷代帝皇遺物時的悄景吧？看伊見了伊的丈夫，咸豐的遺物時的那種無窮的傷戚，以及伊把伊的愛子！同治的一件玩其，（便是那有一雙紅眼珠和一條活動的紅舌的小白兔）攜回內寢，撫麼終夜的悲哀，我們可以知道在飮食方面，起居方面，以至靑感方面，太后都是和我們相同的；伊只是較普通的人多擁着一種龐大的政治勢力而已（四四〇）</p>

<p>— 涂筱巢</p>
<p>余於夏秋之交，曾歷遊贛，湘，鄂等處，折而返滬，並經無寗，而以南昌之遊，印象較深。蓋南昌雖為江西省會所在地，究屬偏於內地一隅，曩遊此間，殊覺其街道簡陋，較之長江流域其他文人埠，殊有遜色。近數年來，因蔣委員長曾駐節南昌，督剿赤匪有年，市民人口驟增，商業漸振；益以省府當局，慘淡經營，力圖整理市政與交通上之建設，贛東西南北各公路榦綫，早經完成，浙贛鐵路，亦通單在即，各該路均以南昌為樞紐，鐵路經過南昌，設南北車站一所，南站建築雄偉，行將竣工，南昌電燈電話，早經妥為整頓，應用極便，其自來水亦正在籌議興辦中，並擬募集大宗欵項，重修滕王閣勝蹟，而南昌市於修築寬大馬路外，並闢城北為新村住宅區，市面煥然一新。余此次涉足於斯，大有今昔之感！</p>
<p>曩者，余輒以中國內地旅行，不但水陸交通，時虞跋涉梗阻之艱險，即其寄居就食之旅舍菜館，亦覺其居之局促而食不適口。此種旅行之苦况，匪獨遐鄉僻壤為然，而曩昔旅居南昌者，亦頗以佳食為慮。此次於役贛省，途中亦曾念及住食問題，嗣於船　車箱中，探悉南昌近有洪都招待所之設，據云住食均極安適，於是逕投該所寄居數日，在此數日中，殊屬出於意料之外，蓋以旅居南昌住食不使之感，至此釋然，目增益不少之遊興焉。</p>
<p>余久居滬瀆，頗苦　囂，及至該所，行裝甫卸，襟懷頓爽。蓋該所位於新村住宅區王陽明路之中段，房屋建築雄偉，院落軒敞，地勢幽靜，而交通又極便利。寄居於此者，輒覺別有天地，旣喜其雅潔，又無繁囂之苦，宜其胸襟為之一快也。以言設備，較之滬上各大旅社，有過之無不及，其中西菜點，庖製亦頗精美，故通來旅居南昌各高尚旅客，多畢集於此。余此次漫遊各處，因南昌市政旣已更新，其件食復較為舒適，故對於南昌之行，印象獨深，爰沘筆記之。</p>

<h3 id="c154">羅斯在華工作之動向 <a href="#c154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— 森禹</p>
<p>當羅斯未蒞上海之前、作者曾於本刊一四二期準策羅氏對華工作要點有四：（一）整理過去借欵與投資，（二）對華單獨新貨欵，（三）　中國加入英鎊集團，（四）佈置對日之基礎。茲觀羅斯最近言行，其直接間接所表現者，似頗與吾人過去猜度相符：爰再就羅氏工作動向，加以客觀之檢討：</p>
<p>（一）整理過去借欵與投資</p>
<p>此項在羅氏工作中似較次要，目近於消極的，故一般人多未加若何注意：但吾人以為此一問題决非單純的一討債問題」，實含有鞏固英國在華經濟陣綫之意義。考英國過去對華借欵與投資，多以重要稅收及鐵道利益等為担保，而中國關鹽兩稅之實權，即大半握於英人之手；最近日美等對於英或此種優越地位頗思擠軋，尤以日本攫取海關權之野心更見積極，英國為保持其堡壘之鞏固，縱使不想向中國討還債欵，實亦有不得不藉整理之名，配置其新的陣綫。羅斯最近搜集之特別注重於中國債務，况及稅收悄形者，蓋為準備整個的澈底的整頓中英間債務關係，此中意義一方面固屬向中國開示索債淸單，但在另一方面主要目的實為重行明白確立「債務担保品」，以防阻他國之覬覦。</p>
<p>不過，依據吾人觀察，整理中英間已往債欵投資之工作頗覺繁重，恐非短期所可完成；至於此種經濟陣綫，若同時無他種力量加以迥護，則在日本大刀闊斧手段之下，仍將不堪一擊，北寗鐵路以及開濼煤礦等之前例可為明鑑。</p>
<p>（二）對華單獨貸欵及投資</p>
<p>（一）貸欵之担保品　羅氏曾對新聞記者談及對華貸欵問題，其中有云「視担保品之性質如何」者，蓋即表示對華貸欵必須為有條件的，而所謂「擔保品」云云，顯然將進一步涉及中國經濟主權與財務行政；上述羅氏之特別重視中國債務實况及稅收情形，一方面亦為覓取新的擔保品之準備，而該項擔保品之主要對象，無疑的爲中國之稅收及其他國有事業（鐵路礦業等）之收入。倘使中英間借欵協定果眞成立，而以某項稅收或國有產業為担保，則英國即將藉監督與稽核之名，更形操縱中國稅務及國有事業；結果，英國不僅直接的控制中國財政而脈，問接的復可藉以促進貿易投資之有利的發展。</p>
<p>（二）貸欵與投資之民間對象　羅氏固亦明知與中國政府折衝，將受種神掣肘，未必若何順利；更有與政府以外之民間團體及私人間從事種種協議之必要，而中國金融界與實業界，即為最良好之對象，羅氏連日與上海金融實業袖之會唔，不無具有此種重要意圖。</p>
<p>（三）投資之主要方向　中國北方恐無挿足餘地，西北又不順利，中部牽制亦多；西南方面近來雖亦受到日本之威脅，並將與法國發生衝突，但尚為比較無路可走中之路，且海有香港，陸有印度，進出較便，故目前英國對華之中心地似在西南（自然非為絕對放棄中部及西北等，可能範圍內，仍進行活動）。羅氏最近工作，似亦偏重於該方，而積極進行中之西南各省大交通網計畫，即為底定基礎之重要步驟。其次，經營西南不僅為對華進出之基礎，且在未來世界大職中占絕大作用，西南與印度緬甸香港甚至新加坡等打成一片時，太平洋上英國陣勢即將佔取優越地位。</p>
<p>以上三項為英國活動升借欵與新投資之主要動態，其前途之最後决定，自有待於未來國際形勢之推移與中　方面最終態度；但根據吾人眼前推測，似不敢為英國抱充分樂觀：（一）貸欵之擔保品牽動中國財政主權，將遭中國人民之反對，且亦必然引起國際帝國主義尤其是日本之忌嫉，出而阻撓；（二）向中國足間投資雖比較可能成就，然預料亦將引起　美等之反感，而須打破不少困難；（三）日本最近對西南亦巳加緊仲展，而法國之勢力又未可輕視，故英國之經營西南，至少將引起日英法二角對立，而發生抓種事故。</p>
<p>（三）勸中國加入英鎊集團</p>
<p>羅氏雖諱言勸中國加入英鎊集團，但同時彼表示將從事對於中　經濟尤其是幣制作詳密之研究，則已有蛛絲馬跡可尋，况客觀事實所示，此一工作為羅氏來華之必有節目，其所以諱莫是深者，特為避免種種掣肘而已。</p>
<p>最近有一部分金融界人士唱中國加入英鎊集團之聲浪頗高，並有所謂立即聯繫中英匯兌之提議，此誠屬值得注意之事。彼等以為現階段中國經濟恐慌之根原在於銀匯之過高及通貨之收縮，竟抹煞其他政治的經濟的基本因素，而將一切恐慌責任全部加在貨幣身上，倒果為因，莫此為甚。吾人殊覺中國加入英鎊集團後，將喪失貨幣獨立主權（也有人以為主權問題只屬名　，於實際無關重要；若然，則整個國家主權亦可認為僅屬名義，不妨司業幹送十試問可與不可），且匯價跟英鎊上落，仍無安定之可能：此種附庸性之發展，將使中國經濟恐慌反趨嚴重。或以日圓亦與英鎊有關，竟無若何禍害；因而遽行論定中國加入英鎊集團為無害有益，謊謬實無過於此！日圓和英鎊之關係與中國之加入英鎊集團，其性質固屬不同，即便性質相同，試問中國與日本之國家地位是否亦同？總之，中國加入英鎊集團有弊無利，吾人未敢歡迎。</p>
<p>至於中國加入英鎊集團對於國際間之影響，自屬非常嚴重，毋待　述；美日之極大反對，勢所必然。</p>
<p>（四）佈置對日之基礎</p>
<p>對於應日關係，羅氏或仍將繼續嘗試與日協調；但希望頗少，即使可能，亦僅屬非常狹小之限度。日本之野心，終無使英國放懷之一日，於是一方面英國復不得不謀抵禦之道，但佔計彼工作大致有三：（一）利用國際勢力阻止日本勢力之膨脹，（二）聯合以抗拒日本之侵略，（三）在中國經濟的政治的各階　廣汎地確立對日基礎。但（一）國際關係複雜，非絕對可靠；現時中國力量太弱，而掣肘亦太多；至於（三）如上述攫取中國財政權貨幣權以及經營西南等等，俱為攻守兩全之策略，可惜障碍太多。</p>
<p>以上，吾人巳將此次羅斯在華之已做應做將做各項工作加以概括分析，客覜形勢所示，其結果恐未必盡如英國之懷抱。唯亦不能絕對肯定一無所成，比較可能收穫的，或為下列幾頃；（一）對於日本之野心當能更進一步認識，可為英國政府極重要敎訓；（二）調查考察中國經濟悄形之所得，可為英國政府良好參考資料；（三）中英間過去債欵關係，或可商定一整理原則；（四）或可在民間成立幾種合作事業；（五）如某種限度內之借欵成立，或可獲得一部分鐵道鑛業上之利益。以上各項，（一）（二）無問題；但（三）離實際尚遠，有待日後再議；至於（四）（五）則僅為「可能」，尚須克服多重阻力。最近歐非局勢緊張，以及日本對政華策之總動員，將使羅期之工作愈益艱巨！</p>
<h3 id="c155">土地村有制之檢討 <a href="#c155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— 陳鴻根</p>
<p>土地問題自來使成為政治上一個核心的問題。在原始時代的社會中士地本屬公有，至三代而演為井田之制，到了秦始臬併天下以後，私有制度因以確立，土地之集中與日俱進，而影饗於社會中之生產關係者亦至巨。所以每一朝代的政治變動以後，勝利者無不以改革土地制度為當務之亟，藉以為號召而安定民心。這一類的改革多數楚在防止土地所有權之集中，其最膾炙人口者為王莽時之王田制度，西晋之百姓占田法，後魏之均田制度，隋之永業露田制，唐之世業口分制，宋之限限制等。然而行之有效者甚少，到後來，幾無不放棄其政策，於是土地又復歸於私有集中之途徑。自明代以後兼併之事實與程度愈演愈深，清代而至於今日，迄未有澈底之救濟。報載晋閻錫山氏倡土地村有制，以防赤禍之蔓延。其要義為：</p>
<p>（一）由村公所發行公債收全村土地為公有</p>
<p>（二）按土地之性質劃分為若干份地分給村民耕作。</p>
<p>（三）農民在耕作年齡起訖時受田還田，如有地少人多或地多人少時則以移民調劑之。</p>
<p>（四）以產業保護稅所得稅不勞働稅等收入價還收買土地之公債。</p>
<p>閻氏倡議此種辦法實具有極遠大之眼光，在原則上是無可　議的。不過吾人鍳於過去土地改革成收之經過，在事實一定遭遇若干不可避免的困難茲謹就鄙見所及，將關於此種辦法的意見貢獻三，不敢自决其是非，聊備國人之參考云耳。</p>
<p>（甲）耕地之患寡與不均—中國今日農民普徧的患着耕地的不足，可是究竟不足到怎樣程度，也沒有確切的證明。據國府主計處二十二年調查結果每戶平均有耕地二一畝，張心一氏估計每人有耕地三·六畝，克里塞（Cressy）估計每人有耕地〇·四畝，貝克氏（Baker）估計每戶可有耕地二·八五畝，金大六省十三處調查結果每戶平均有更低二·五二公頃。而美國每日平均有更低三·六畝，約比中國大九倍，每戶有耕地五七畝，比中國約大十八倍。在我國耕地面積狹小之情形下，我們發現並沒有如外國大地中那樣大量集中的情形。是以今日之土地分配問題的核心不在以巳耕地之重行分劃，乃以可耕而未耕地之面積為轉移。中國可耕地之面積據翁文灝氏估計（錐指集）共一百萬方哩，貝克氏估計為七萬萬畝，均失之過高。巳耕地面積據二十二年國府主計處調查共一，二四八，七八一，〇〇〇畝，約合一八九，八一四，七二畝，然實際上决不止此數，因有若干耕地為避稅計多不呈報，故難以確實。張心一氏十四省食源調查結果謂除東北四省外其他九省耕地面積之擴充不易超出現有耕地百分之五。考井田制度之施行，係因人口稀少，土地甚多，故猶可計口授田如苟悅所云（通考卷一引）「且夫井出之制，不宣於人衆之時，田廣人寡，苟為可也」。所以在今日人口繁重之時欲行授田之制，其困難必有過於昔日之井田或均田制。而未夾耕地擴充之可能性又復如此渺小，欲使分田之制久行弗輟，當為事實所不許。</p>
<p>（乙）各村土地有多少肥瘠有不同—閻氏主張係依各村之土地就村民分配之。第一個問題便是村有大小，土地分配仍是不得其均。或以為村小地少人少，村大地多人多，正是個平。而實際南方之村莊面積多較北方為小，人口反較北方為密，此於人口密度與土地分配之差數可以見之。依氏之主張如本村土地不足分配則為無地之人為謀生路，或移入有餘地之村以調劑之，此固今日土地私有制之下所習見通行者，如化田為公有而授之於民，則何人不願有田可耕，安居於其鄉土，而寗願出外謀生。尤其在我國家庭與鄉土觀念濃厚之色彩下，除非有天災人禍的壓迫，誰也不輕願離開鄉土，所以結果必致發生若干爭論。再就土等之品質言，肥瘠旣各有不同，如强為劃成若干地塊則人人必爭取膏腴之地。如盛如梓庶齋老學叢談所云地形之奇零，地質之不均，水早之不勻在在足為劃分井田之困難。且據周官所載每夫受田之數亦非如孟子所云限於百晦。如大司徒云「以土均之法辨五物，九等制大下之地徵以作民賦，以令地貢，以騐財富，以均齊天下之政。」所以周代授田之制亦有二種。鄉遂之田，上地，夫一塵，田有晦？萊五十畮，餘夫亦如之；中地夫一塵，田百畮，萊白晦，餘夫亦如之；下地夫一塵，田百晦，萊二百晦，餘夫亦如之。」都鄙之田不易之家百畝，一易之家二百畝，再易之家三百畝。』此種分配方法亦不過欲使其趨於平均而巳，然而事實上辦理一定很是煩瑣。今就一村之地授與村民，如不分等級，則猶不及井田之公允，如欲行分等則其繁難又不可避免矣。</p>
<p>（丙）重行分劃之困難——依村公有案辦法第十三案之規定存公所應安人口增加情形，土地改良狀况，在適當期間將份地重行劃分。此言之固易而行之實艱。未成年之農民必繼續有達於耕作年齡以請分地者，同時亦不斷有年老農民還田於村公所者。此授田還田之事極為繁重。若積至數年或十年始行重劃一次，則已達受田年齡之農民在重劃前又將何所事。且在巳受田者言之，守業巳數年，若令其改耕他田，則必不願改良其田地，或於重劃之前耗盡其地力，故若干年之後田地之生產力必大减，農民之狀况仍未有改進。北朝隋唐之均田制度之所以不克久行，一部份即由於授田簿藉之紊亂，卒至於授田而不得其均，前車可鑒，今茲又將何以糾正之？</p>
<p>（丁）關於村公所——所有一切土地淸丈，人口登記，及士地分配事宜旣統由村公所辦理，則其負資人負對於上項事務必曾受相當之訓練，方克無處其差誤。而今日之農村敎育如此幼稚，一般農民不知土地公有為何物，加以村公所之辦理土地分配事宜，未必能具有必備之學識與經騐，結果或引起農民之懷欵，以為政府謀攫取其土地，卒至勞而無功，甚或致引起農民之反抗。且村民良莠不齊，有一部份係屬地痞流氓，本無立錐之地，却因此分到田地，同時有若干性情懶墮，揮霍無度之農民已喪失其土地所有權者亦因此享受同等之機會。一般勤儉之農民，本來有田數十畝，家道小康者，在士地重劑後有時非但不能改善其境遇，反而遭受損失。尤其在佃農率低落的地方易於產生此抓現象，更以地痞流氓多與土豪劣紳勾結，把持村公所，這一來所有分配士地的手續皆經其手辦理，將肥美的田地劃歸本身或親友耕種，以剩餘之次等地分給他人。</p>
<p>（戊）關於所得稅——凡領耕地者必以其收入十分之一納勞動所得稅，以作為公債償還金之一部份担保。孟子云「夏后氏五十而貢，殷人七十而助，周人百畝以徹，其實皆什一也」後人拘於什一之說，競相附會，有謂係由於為政寬急之不同所致者，有謂係丈尺之差異者，莫衷一是。今令受田之農民亦按其收穫納十分之一，是否公允，亦屬令人滋疑。地方之肥瘠不等，每畝之產量各異，在今日租佃制下租穀租言，莫不依其每畝之產量為準繩而之，以分租貢佃業雙方所得之成數變化亦極多，有所謂對分，三七分，四六分，二八分等，總期雙方之利害能得其平衡。現在若令一律納十分之一的勞働所得稅則耕種良田之農民與耕種次等田之農民負担不能均衡。</p>
<p>（己）土地公有後能永久防止兼併嗎——今日較大之地主莫不與當地方之政治發生相當關係，即謂暫時令其放集土地，然終不能防止其逼賣之事。農民田地旣為强豪所兼併而賦稅則仍需担負。此於北朝隋唐之均田制施行結果可以見之，如寓國鼎氏云「均田制度均授良以田，而逃戶之多，乃以施行均田制度之北朝隋唐為最……西漢不授人以田而按畝徵租，故戶稅較輕。自均田制度行而田租亦按戶徵收，故戶賦大增。然田之收授，祇在政治淸明田多人少時行之。遵行之時暫而有名無實之時多，豪强兼併，貧弱失田，官不復授，而賦之重者已不可復輕，遂至重為民病相率逃亡，非病有田也，逃重賦也」</p>
<p>以上數點，是關於土地村有制本身之討論，此外還有殘點比較基本的問題，也列舉如下</p>
<p>（甲）土地公有與私有，利弊孰甚——前面已說過在原始時代土地本屬公有，而社會演進之結果，已普徧的造成私有現象。這種趨向之迭成亦非偶然的，必有其背景之推動，蓋因私有與佔有為人類之天性，自私有制成立後，個人始願竭力工作，以謀私囊之充實，社會之經濟與文化之進步亦基於斯，歐洲自個人主義與自由競爭思想發達，工商業之進展何一日千里，美國今日之交通與其他公用事業大部份皆中私人經營，其效能與服務之精神亦不减於國營事業，而其動機則重在利己也。是以土地究應公有或私有，實為一應加以深刻考慮之問題</p>
<p>（乙）今日之土地問題或整個農業問題，亦不限於分配方面——醫如土地利用問題亦極重要。我國今日農民所投於土地之人力甚多，如與美國比較，每公頃棉之生產中國需人工一六二零小時，美國只二八九小時，高梁中國需六三七小時，美國僅需四八小時。其他作物之情形亦如是（據卜凱氏調查中國農家之結果與美國一九二一年農業年鑑之統計比較）中國雖用大量之人力於土地，而其產量仍不及他國之高。依通奈氏（Tawney：Land　and　Labor　inChina）之研兜日本的米每畝產量為二三五零磅，中國只一七五零磅。小麥之每畝產量英吉利及威爾土為三二。九布希耳，而中國居第九，只一零。八布希耳。玉米之產量美國居第一，為二七·八布希耳，中國居第六得一一·七布希耳。由此可知今日中國農工之效力遠不及他國之高。所以假使就有限之面積，改良生產之手段，提高每畝產量，於農民生活上亦大改進，其他關於農業金融，農產運銷，農村教育，衛生等在一需切實之改革，不容吾人忽視。從多方同時下手，我國農村經濟之復與，庶可有望。</p>
<p>（丙）以農業作人口供養某礎的危機——「以農立國」差不多已成為國人的口頭禪，這句話的確能代表中國過去的或現在的經濟狀况。但是將來是否能繼續以農立國，頗有考慮之必要。中國本部可以灌漑之地旣已大部份用盡，未來可以灌溉之地只限於黃河兩岸數處及東三省，且據專家推算，即雖農業實行科學化，其產額不易超過現有百分之二十至百分之五十。充其量亦不過暫時稍為提高農民之生活程度，經過相當時期，必恢復到以前貧困的狀况。現時各大强國多已由農業文朋而進入工業文明，以大工廠吸收剩餘的人口，土地之分配問題因得較易解决。中國目前要工業化也有幾種困難。第一是財力人力之缺乏，第二是礦物及動力原料之不足，第三是不易與他國在世界市塲中爭奪銷路，結果仍是無效，所以現在祇得求農工業之同時發展，一方面助長本國工業到相當限度，一方面努力農業之改進，庶可以調劑耕地之不足，而穩定國足經濟之基礎。</p>
<p>最後我們承認在中國今日謀土地分配之改革，並不是毫無意義的，多少能在相當範圍內解决人民之生計問題。土地公有制亦非决不可行，若有十分詳密的計劃，能勝過已往公有制之種種困難，當　有絕大的價值。所以希望倡議者能續心去研究其　論與　行之步驟，庶使村公有制能切實達到解放農民的目標。</p>

<p>分數更正　大會發表上海只得二十六分、但查游泳第四之一分、被誤列入廣西中、故本報將廣西一分取消、加於上海內、網球馬華至少應得一分半、大會只予一分、故亦更正、理由另詳、大會發表馬華只得十分、與香港等、但因香港錦標、多於馬華、故馬華列入第四云、</p>
<p>女總錦標計分</p>
<p>總錦標　上海　十六分</p>
<p>總第二　廣東　十四分</p>
<p>總第三　山東　四分</p>
<p>總第三　山西　四分</p>
<p>（附註）山東山西各得四分、無法判分高下、故幷列第三、</p>
<p>分數更正　大會發表馬來亞亦得四分、但據本報計算、只有三分、因網球之一分、應給四川也、理由另見、</p>

<p>預算祇五萬</p>
<p>大會於本月十日行開慕禮、參觀者有一萬人、門票售出一萬六千元、其後數日、人數不多、每日祇售二三千元、待游泳足球開始、觀衆突然增加、每日門票在萬元以上、昨日為閉幕、有中西足球比賽、參觀者仍眾、售去門票一萬三千餘元、據云、大會委託市銀行及中國旅行社代售之券資、尚未完全繳會、昨晚大會計算門票收入、約有十一萬元、超出門票預算五萬元一倍以上云、</p>

<p>根據大會發出之總錦標計分表、男子網球四川得第三、馬來亞得第四、但憑核比賽成績、馬來得雙打第三名、四川得單雙打兩個第四、則錦標名次、馬來列第三、四川居第四、但大會公佈適得其反、最低限度、兩隊亦應並列第三、以各得一分半計算、如是則大會總錦標名次、馬來以十分半居第三、香港以十分列第四、今馬來以網球列第四、遂影響及於總錦標之名次、些微之差、關係非輕、此應請大會注意者一、</p>
<p>女子網球第一山西、第二上海、已毫無疑問、南京得單打第三第四名、位居第三、亦無問題、四川得雙打第三、應列網球錦標之第四、馬來亞雖曾得雙打第四、但已不能上名、今大會發表之總錦標計分表中、四川竟無分數、而馬來亞反以一分居第四、不知從何根據、此應請大會注意者二、此次大會、前有五項運動第六七名之倒置錯誤、因無人抗議、乃糊塗過去、幸與錦標名次無關、尚屬小事、今網球分數、雖祗些微之差、但適與錦標名次有關、至為重要、應請大會根據成續、愼審核對公佈、以示信實、茲本報巳代為更正、並將昨日本報所載男女綱球錦標形勢、複載如下、以供參考、</p>

<p>昨日游泳比賽、仍於下午一時開始、僅有三項、即男子二百公尺接力决賽、男子一千五百公尺自由式决賽、女子二百公尺接力决賽、至是游泳比賽全部束、廣東男女兩組、得分均佔最多數、各奪得錦標歸去、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>男二百接力　男子二百公尺、接力决賽、山東河北靑島三單位、均棄權、故僅平馬贛閩粵桂滬港八單位參加、每單位四人、鳴槍入池、港粵領先、不相上下、及至最後一樣、港較粵稍進、以二分一秒二到達終點、但粵亦以二分一秒四到達終點、所差不過十分之二秒耳、第三馬來亞、第四上海、第五福建、第六廣西、</p>
<p>男一千五百　男子一千五百公尺自由式决賽、實為最緊張之一幕、參加者計有八人、初人池時、滬·施博根、馬·楊維莫、領先、未及十匝、而施漸落後、港·陳震南·在掌聲雷鳴中、得與楊維莫幷駕齊驅、此時粵麥偉明、桂·黃景煥、港·陳振興、亦不相上下、及至十八匝時、陳振興忽以力竭不安、中途輟游、閩·洪訓亦繼之中輟、此時繼續游泳者僅六人、已均有得獎之望、故各加足馬力、猛力前進、及至二十五匝、楊維莫更一躍登先、港·陳霞南、亦不甘示弱、竭力追赶、楊陳二人、較餘人已遠出二匝有餘、結果楊終較勝一籌、及楊達終點、陳尚有二十公尺之距離、楊得第一、陳第二、但兩人成績一為二十二分五十九秒二、為二十三分二十三秒一、均破全國紀錄、尚有桂·雷秉昌、雖列殿軍、與第五名相差無幾、閩雷年僅十四、實屬後生可畏、</p>
<p>女二百接力　女子二百公尺接力决賽、為壓軸戲、原定有廣東馬來亞福建廣西香港等五隊、惟參加比賽者僅廣東香港廣四三隊、香港隊擁有楊氏姊妹、冠軍最為把握、廣東隊劉桂珍陳煥瓊等、亦屬健者、自不甘落、香港之後、入水後、廣東梁玉珍一路領先、香港陳玉輝追隨於後、第二人粵港無分軒輊、第三人廣東為小將翁煥瓊而港隊楊秀珍之遊行遲緩、實為後來屈居亞軍之主因、第四人廣東隊為劉桂珍、入水至八公尺時、港隊楊秀瓊始入比、楊雖猛力前衝、至終點時、仍以二公尺許、屈居第二、第三廣西、成績第一廣東隊、二分三十九秒二、破全國及遠東紀錄第二香港隊、二分四十二秒七、亦破全國紀錄、第三廣西隊二分四十九秒、平等全國紀錄、</p>

<p>戴淑國成績可貴埃</p>
<p>昨日各項競賽中、其最可貴者、爲戴淑國之四百公尺、戴爲此次全運會四百公尺冠軍、並以五十二秒二、創全國新紀錄、昨戴在四百公尺賽中、戴起步甚快、在二百公尺至三百公尺時、途中與西人立考納夫競爭甚烈、速度極佳、跑畢似尙有餘力、此蓋爲戴昨日造成全國紀錄之一大原因、戴以五十一秒六創全國紀錄、可謂前無古人、此項紀錄將被認爲本年度四百公尺之全國最高紀錄、</p>
<p>劉長春震驚四座</p>
<p>劉長春在百公尺及二百公尺賽中、執得兩項牛耳、而兩項成績、亦差强人意、第一項之百公尺决賽、劉長春自起步至終點、均領導在先、實力非常雄厚、不愧爲吾國唯一之短跑怪傑、百公尺賽後未及十分鐘、而二百公尺開始矣、劉一路領前、拋落第二戴淑國甚遠、四座震驚、百公尺及二百公尺、均在逆風中舉行、而成績白公尺十一秒正、二百公尺二十二秒三、特以二百公尺之成績絞全國紀錄甚爲接近、</p>
<p>郝春德兩項冠軍</p>
<p>老將郝春德、在本屆全運會中、有如龍困沙灘、固資格問題、未得下塲、昨日運動會中、始得一展手身、於擲標槍賽中、以五十九公尺一二九奪得冠軍、壓倒全運會冠軍彭永馨、又郝於跳遠中、亦奪得冠軍、成績六公尺六三、壓全運會跳遠冠軍葉遂安、實則昨日郝共勝本屆全運冠軍二人、郝君雅老、但威風猶存、</p>
<p>李世銘一失一得</p>
<p>李世銘在八百公尺中、以二分四秒二、打破全國紀錄、但其成績不及本屆全運冠軍之二分二秒一、又李于擲標槍、爲本屆大會之得分者、李于昨日之擲標槍、得四七公尺八一五之成績、但未掛名、可云一失一得、</p>
<p>名將多賦歸去兮</p>
<p>昨日之鐵餅决賽、吾因缺二大將、一爲本屆冠軍郭潔、郭於前日返大連原籍、一爲亞軍冷培根、冷早巳返京、又傳金城於百公尺及二百公尺未出塲、因赴杭遊歷、八百公尺及千五百公尺賈運仁亦放棄、聞係身體欠適、又曾在遠曾跳高得分之吳必顯、此次被大會取消資格、昨大會雖請吳君出席、但實則吳君早於四五天前返津矣、又跳高之于淸榮亦賦歸去、</p>
<p>競賽細描</p>
<p>一百</p>
<p>一次鳴槍、因西人偷步、故被召回、第二次槍聲響時、劉長春起步之敏捷、猶如大會之决賽時趙秉恒次之、劉一路領先、在五十公尺處、已勝趙二公尺、終點時勝第二葉海濤五公尺、葉趙在五十公尺處、競爭甚烈、結果葉卒超前而獲第二、</p>
<p>二百</p>
<p>二百公尺、繼百公尺後即舉行、劉長春未在全運中跑二百公尺、故此次决致力於此項、一　手身、劉在吾國短跑界中、資望頗高、七八年來、無人能破之、昨在二百公尺中、劉君以實力示人、可見劉之英名、果不虛傳、</p>
<p>四百</p>
<p>四百公尺賽中、華隊只李延祥及戴淑國二人參加、戴起步最快、在二百公尺至三百公尺處、與西人立考奴競爭甚烈、但戴愈跑愈快、而李延祥未幾亦起過西人方薩可與立考奴二人、終點時、戴勝第二李延祥約十公尺、</p>
<p>八百</p>
<p>八百公尺、賈連仁未出塲、缺乏競爭、李世銘始終居首位、邱思澄隨之、其後爲三西人、李世銘寫寫意意、始終未費多大力氣、直撲終點、成績二分四秒二、打破全國紀錄、邱忠澄在八百公尺在未用力、安然得第二、因尙預備在千五百公尺中得分、</p>
<p>千五</p>
<p>王正林近來有改中距離之傾向、千五百公尺竟成其拿手好戲、王正林於起步、即大刀闊斧、不顧一切、用其擅長之速度跑、一路導先、次者爲二西人、邱居第四、王正林愈跑愈快、他人並無與之競爭者、邱離居最後、但腹有成竹、於最後之三百公尺中、則進至第二位矣、</p>
<p>跳遠</p>
<p>跳遠出席者、國人有三大將、即葉遂安·張嘉夔·郝春德·葉張過去成績、均達七公尺、而老郝則爲全國紀錄之保持者、參加之三西人、無一足述、第一週試跳、各無特殊、郝於第四跑得六來六三、葉於第三次跳得六米五七、成績如下、</p>
<p>（一）郝春德（中）　六公尺六三</p>
<p>（二）葉遂安（中）　六公尺五七</p>
<p>（三）張嘉夔（中）　六公尺四一</p>
<p>（四）瓦特（西）　六公尺一五</p>
<p>跳高</p>
<p>跳高决賽、吾國出塲者、有劉明儒·丘廣爕二人、惜吳必顯、于淸榮、均賦歸去、未克一顯身手、昨日參加之賽員、均跳過一公尺六六、升至一公尺七一、劉明儒·安特遜·古新拉·丘廣爕、四人跳過、升至一公尺七四、只劉一人跳過、餘三人均未過、乃升降數次、而一三一四之名次决矣、繼增至一公尺七八、劉一跳不過、遂罷、</p>
<p>（一）劉明儒（中）　一公尺七四</p>
<p>（二）安特遜（西）　一公尺七一</p>
<p>（三）丘廣爕（中）　一公尺七一</p>
<p>（四）古新拉（中）　一公尺七一</p>
<p>鐵餅</p>
<p>冷增根·郭潔缺席、吾國只張齡化一人參加、張以孤軍奮戰、以三六公尺六八五、得亞軍、興首名賴幅相極高近差、設郭冷在此、則冠軍决不致落諸外人之手矣、</p>
<p>（一）賴高府（西）　三六公尺八九</p>
<p>（二）張齡佳（中）　三六公尺六八五</p>
<p>（三）屈夫敏高（西）　三穴公尺三十</p>
<p>（四）加張（中）　三四公尺四九五</p>
<p>標槍</p>
<p>擲來擲去、彭永聲居首位、至第五六擲時、形勢大變、第五擲敖華明得四八公尺六五、壓倒羣雄距料西人客清亦於第五擲一鳴驚人、得四八公尺八七、一躍而居首位、彭永馨力求勝之、但願與心違、幸有老將郝春德、最後一槍定乾坤、得四九公尺二五、執得冠軍、國軍始免於屈辱、</p>
<p>（一）郝春德（中）　四九·二五公尺</p>
<p>（二）客淸（西）　四八·八七公尺</p>

<p>二比一擊敗南京黃山農</p>
<p>女子網球單打、亞軍爭奪戰、於昨晨九時舉行、滬魏麥谷恃其穩健之擊法、劇戰三盤、以二比一難分、黃善攻、魏善守、惜黃自殺太多、被魏以柔克剛、第一盤、魏聲勢烜赫、先發制人、連下三局、黃亦不甘後人、照樣不敬、廣成各四平手、魏再接再厲、時以聲東擊西之法、使敵疲於奔命、加以兩句、以六比四先勝一盤、再戰聲中、黃仍不景氣、以四比二屈居下風、是時風雲轉變、黃突然振作、正反抽擊、峻急非凡、而左右前後、隨心所欲、魏則奔走招架、無力發球、黃三元連中以五比四後來居上、次向黃發球、先以四十對十五佔優、後又老病復發、一再百殺、造成和局、但黃毫不氣餒、繼續努力、果然有志竟成、連得兩局、以七比五扳回一盤、形成均勢、第三盤爲勝負所繫、然黃於上盤中用力過度、疲乏不堪、魏則光芒萬丈、氣燄高張、一鼓作氣、連下五局、黃雖奮勇抗抵、奪回三局、但大勢已去、回天乏術、遂被魏以六比三獲得最後勝利、而居亞軍黃列第三、</p>

<p>明日夜車啟程　後日下午舉行</p>
<p>中委羅家倫首先發起、邀請全運足球隊赴京作振災比賽、由勵志社招待、吳市長大爲贊成、特向大會名譽顧問香港區總領隊顏成坤接洽、請該隊於大會閉幕後、分別在南京上海兩地作振災比賽、將所收券資、撥振各地災區、顏氏關懷祖國、熱心公益當經答允、並决定二十三日在南京陵園運動塲舉行、二十六日在上海表演、聞該隊已定於二十二日夜車晋京、二十三日比賽後、即行返滬、一俟二十六日再行比賽後、候輪返港對賽隊將由京滬各將合組而成、晋京旅費、及其他招待、京市已决定担任、據顏氏對中央社記者稱、該隊除門將包家平因職務關係、須先返港外、其餘李惠堂曹桂成等一行十四人、悉數參加京滬振災球賽、準備以最優美之球藝、引起觀衆興趣，以增收人、廣東譚江柏楊水益兩員健將、因感情關係、亦决偕行、港隊名單如下、李惠堂·譚江柏·梁榮照·黃美順李國威·曹桂成·楊水益·鄭李良·黎兆榮·卓石金·李碩友·梁現贊·楊本漢·余慶元·黃華繼·何家强·</p>

<p>昨日下午三時、大會足球優勝各隊混合之華聯隊、與滬上西人最强足球隊混合之西聯隊作戰、我方因球王李惠堂傷臂、鋼門包家平傷腰·及徐亞輝·陳鎭和·孫錦順·諸健將均未出塲、實力大爲减色、華聯隊以香港馬來亞兩軍爲基本、廣東僅加入一譚江柏、但猶仗其頭上功夫、救出險球不少、西聯左右翼極活躍、內衛綫更十分鞏固、結果零對零、未分勝負、雙方表演、殊未見十分緊張、更少精采、華聯五鋒、派司雖出神入化、但苦無射門脚頭、曹桂成失去機會最多、勞師無功、若有球王在塲、勝來必毫不費力也、</p>
<p>市長開球</p>
<p>昨日下午三時二十分、戰爭開始、由吳市長開球、曹桂成截獲後、飛向敵營進攻、防衛番將兩路殺來、曹桂成心急慌亂攻鬥出綫、未幾中鋒謝慶福領師猛攻、在三十碼外、遠射球門、及門飛越而過、同時番翼華特、威利兩路殺到、左右打門、亦無效果、</p>
<p>門柱作梗</p>
<p>此後十五分鐘內、西聯全軍進攻、殺氣騰騰、好不利害、環打球門、連續不休、幸黃錦柏老練鎭靜、球來手擋脚踢、未失寸地、如是此往彼來、消磨光陰、至第三十分鐘時、我左內鋒黎兆榮、接着曹桂成傳來妙球、三四個盤旋、跨過最後防綫、緊緊一脚、猛射球門、不料球運不佳、門柱作梗、砰然一聲、球被彈回、曹桂成截住一脚、亦未中的、番將歡天喜地、我軍垂頭偽氣、一剎那、銀笛高鳴、首塲鴨子對鷄蛋、雙方勝負不分、</p>
<p>依樣葫蘆</p>
<p>休息後、易地再戰、我軍猛烈進攻、球在敵營盤旋者凡十餘分鐘、險象百出、射門機會不下七八次、終因我軍前鋒、脚頭欠準、軟弱無力、加以守門老番、訓練有索、卒致勞師無功、全塲同聲浩嘆、至第十四分鐘時、我右內鋒姚勝華、發狠盤球過關、來一個調虎離山之計、兩番將以爲姚將傳球與右翼人、飛奔往截、姚乘機向球門猛踢一球、去如彈丸、不料仍受阻於門柱、依樣葫盧、彈回陣地、可惜亦殊可恨也、</p>
<p>毫無刺激</p>
<p>未幾球風忽轉、我方陣地、又告緊張、西聯五鋒到處活動、左右翼橫衝直撞、勢如破竹、幸賴譚江柏頭上功夫、一再表演身手、全塲爲之鼓掌、否則、在此緊要之關頭、失却一球、刦數已定、萬難挽回矣、第二十分鐘後、雙方陷於混亂局面、高球來往、戰局鬆懈殊未能刺激人心、最後比賽時間告終雙方始終維持零對零之紀錄、友好精神、表現無餘、全塲笑逐顏開、靜觀閉　典禮、</p>

<p>昨晨十時、中西網球名家，作大食串於全運網球塲、共賽三塲、均採一盤二勝制、結果單打卡遜以二比一勝許承基、錢耀彬以二比〇克福勃斯、雙打許承基林實華以二比〇挫卡遜德孚、各組戰來、均精彩異常、尤以卡許單打、更爲出色、成績如左、</p>
<p>許承基敗於卡遜</p>
<p>許卡之戰、於十時一刻在觀衆掌聲雷動中開始、許爲我國國手、卡爲全滬單打錦標、兩人實力、無分軒輊、勝負全看作戰時之景况而定、當許卡二人由美參加台杯賽返滬時、曾一度在滬角逐、許以二比一勝卡、但許連日在大會比賽、毫無休息，不免精疲力竭、致第一盤以六比一得勝後、卒以精力不濟、爲卞所乘、反以一比二受挫、殊堪涴惜、</p>
<p>精彩百出</p>
<p>卡遜發球失利、許勝利雙收、以二比〇局高佔優勢、先聲奪人、卡努力應戰、扳回一局、許再接再勵、聲勢極盛、低而且急之兩角長抽、延邊直入、卡左右奔走、招架不遑、一帆風順、許連下四局、以六比一先告勝利、十分寫意、第二盤、方小心謹愼、不敢大意、每勝一球、必經相當時間之努力、故精彩百出、掌聲雷動、或則各以低而峻急之長抽還擊、或則各以高球窘敵、但卡遜身高力大、矯捷異常、許略現疏忽、即被卡乘機而起、以五比一遙遙佔先、許雖拚命反攻、奪回一局、終爲卡以六比二造成各一平手、</p>
<p>失之交臂</p>
<p>最後一盤、爲勝負關鍵、戰况益趨熱烈緊張、每球勝負、各出全力以爭、而觀衆亦屏息以待、全神貫注、然許每於緊要關頭、失之交臂、卡則愈戰愈勇、且奔跑迅速、雖遇最難回擊之球、不肯放鬆、勝負之分、殆繫於此、開始時、一方勢均力敵、亦步亦趨、比數始終接近、各二各三、而至各四、許一路領前、第九局許發球、首即雙失誤、繼又自殺野球、接連發現、遂以光局失去、次局卡發球、許先以四十對三十佔優、但求勝心切、每多自殺、卡則審愼應付、不慌不忙、連勝三紀、遂以六比四獲得是盤、</p>
<p>錢耀彬勝福勃斯</p>
<p>錢耀彬對福勃斯之戰、於十一時許開始、福爲上海初級網球單打冠軍、球技楚楚可觀、錢在全運會中、迭挫勁敵、其正手抽擊、銳急非常、開戰後福先發制人、連下三局、錢不甘南伏、還他顏色、以四比三後來居上、福再度努力、造成各四和局、錢振作精神、加上兩局、以六比四先勝一盤、第二盤、錢更形得勢、高壓低抽、得心應心、福則一蹶不振、招架爲難、全盤僅獲一局、一比六又告屈服、</p>
<p>林許配搭得雙打</p>
<p>許林初次配搭、出戰海十無敵之卡遜德孚、經兩盤劇戰、卒以極接近之比數連勝、殊非易易、綜觀四人表演、林寳華最爲出色、許於單打疲乏之餘、且心境不佳、冉戰强敵、不免時露倦容、雖間有極精彩之表演、但以全局論、不若林之賣力、德卡兩人、形勢相仿、挽救險球之妙術、堪嘆觀止、德孚之高壓、時有不可推測之落點、惟失誤亦多、不若卡之穩健、</p>
<p>第一盤</p>
<p>許發球開始、林寳華網前三記輕巧美妙之攔網、取得首局、此後許林二人、頻施高壓妙技、頃刻問以四比〇佔先、卡德扳回二局、但許林亦出師告捷、成五比二、卡德拼命奮鬥、無論如何困難之球、亦必奔赴挽救、一次卡因救球而跌人坐於塲邊之人叢中、努力可見、故終爲追上三局、打成五五平手、旋以亦比五超出、許林謹愼應付、亦奪回二局、七比六再度領先、卡德又造成各七平手、許林振作精神、兩次底角左右抽擊、底定大局、九此七首先告捷、殊爲吃力、</p>
<p>第二盤</p>
<p>卡德　勢非凡的一氣連下三局、觀衆吳不爲許林危、然許林究非弱者、還以顏色、亦一氣呵成三局、造成均勢、旋以四比三超出、德字之發球失利、又告平手、許卡發球均取勝利、成五比五、林許努力應付、一再挽救危球、德孚高壓又自殺網下、丟失一局、許林冉接再厲、以七比五再告勝林、許林奏凱、</p>

<p>全運會籃球錦標賽完畢後、大會爲測騐選手成績起見、特邀約西人强隊、作中西對抗競技、昨日西人隊出場者爲海賊麥令期等强隊組成之全美隊、中華方面、本應由奪得錦標之河北隊出塲、詎河北隊因事前未接得通知、隊員臨時凑合不易、故改由南京菲律濱二隊輪流應戰、昨日南京隊戰來、一變以往遲慢之狀態、傳遞之迅速、派司之準確在全運會中、從未之見、小唐之表演、尤</p>
<p>出神入化</p>
<p>身長體壯之西人、竟奈何他不得、李震中脚上濕氣大發、上塲未數分鐘、即退出袖手旁觀、他如王士選趙志華等、打來亦有聲有色、前日如能照此努力、錦標决不致爲河北所奪、菲律賓隊之技術早獲得各界好評、不辛在次賽中即與强銳之南京隊遭遇、致被淘汰、否則至少可獲複賽權、觀其昨日對全美隊</p>
<p>作戰勇敢</p>
<p>即可知其大概、作日全美隊員、均係滬上西人之精銳、長人瓊生勃里司等、的是可畏人物、惜因久不練習、手脚生疏、合作欠佳、致以數分之差、吃癟於中華隊、半員仍爲昨日决賽之舒鴻、中華首先應戰者、爲南京隊、跳球後、三五傳遞、美軍墨飛犯規、</p>
<p>寶堃首中</p>
<p>一分、李震追步後塵、探手入籃、墨飛將功抵罪、巧中一球、瓊生高人一等、又獲二分、戰成七對七之後、菲僑軍全體登塲、宛如出柙之虎、馬文絞百步穿楊、楊叔方雪中送炭、造成十三對九、美軍急求停戰、籌謀應付方略、聲勢從此一變、雙方戰成各十九平等、後勃里司、復於休息、</p>
<p>銀籃聲中</p>
<p>擲中一球、遂以二十一對十九、美軍佔勝上半時、休息再戰後、南京隊東山再起小唐活躍非凡、邊綫上翻身一擲、姿勢極美、又成平等、繼又獲球進襲、被美後衛撞倒、臥地遙時、球至藍圈中跳出、趙志華趕來、單手一拖、水到渠成、勃里死瓊生等、亦猖獗非凡、不甘退讓、分數緊緊相隨、戰成三十一對二十五後、京隊又掙得幾分</p>
<p>家産遺交</p>
<p>菲軍作戰、陣脚未能站定、美軍大舉入侵、胡人先後奏功、中華隊數次投籃、均成過門不入、西軍趕成三十三對三十四、僅輸一分、時距終了時間、僅有數分、中華復調南京五虎登塲、唐寳堃兩罰兩中、繼又遠射中的、天下大事遂定、鑼聲響處、結果中華以三九對三四巧勝美軍、</p>

<p>結果三比三</p>
<p>小足球表演賽香港對上海於二日上午十時、在書仲光裁判之卜、開始交鋒、兩隊人才濟濟、實力相仿、未開賽前、小球塲一帶看臺人山人海、統計不下萬餘人、爲小球比賽以來所做見、周圍空氣、異常緊張、十時正書裁判蒞塲宣戰、雙方遂正式接觸、肉搏一句鐘、竟造成平局戰事熱烈、不言而喻、茲誌戰情如次、</p>
<p>上半時二對二</p>
<p>交手後港隊拚命衝鋒、希於短時內首造奇功、滬李義臣覩此情景、乃與干伯男聯合防禦、更命賈氏兄弟鞏固邊防、以拒敵軍、港之黃華繼暗施奇術、乘其不備攻其要害、漫山遍野、率大軍來襲何家强石傳、李石友中遞、楊本漢頭頂迫近敵門、於滬隊人馬紛亂中、李石友趕上一腳、球應聲人網、紀錄乃開、賈幼良火氣冲天、孤軍深入、殺進重圍、於右邊綫內猛力一射萬衆呌喊聲中、得功而返雙方平局、港隊楊本漢欲先發制人、爰舉义兵縱橫傳球、迨至後衛綫內、楊氏奮力遠投、球又入門、香港以二比一佔先、賈幼良乃會同萬象華許文奎斜角傳球前犯、大軍節節前進、直至十二碼內、賈幼良目覩立功機會在稱、從容不迪造績一分、二對二又造和局、</p>
<p>下半時一對一</p>
<p>檸檬時間後、雙方又陷入混戰中、爾爭我奪、均因操之過急撕段一刻鐘、不分勝負、李義臣山後方跳出、球落港地後衛犯手球、裁判宣罰、脚舉球入、紀錄爭先、何家强覩此勢須挽回、大難、憤下决心、自創功業因之每每犯規越位未幾由卓石金自右綫傳中何家强乘其無人輕輕一射漢馬功勞竟一舉而得、三對三局勢告成、因此變方益求居首位、心切拚命夾功、二十餘分鐘內、殺得難解難分、剎那間時間已到三比三平局結東、</p>

<p>勗勉足球選手</p>
<p>本屈大會中、足球錦標賽有香港、馬來亞、廣東、上海四大金剛角逐疆塲、實力平均、互有優長、確爲歷屆大會足球賽最精彩之會令、我國在遠東向握足球牛耳、社會興趣亦以足球爲尤甚、最後數日、田徑塲上人山人海、均係觀戰球迷、足球前途之發展正未可限量、今次參加比賽者共有十八個單位、除靑海以人數不足棄權外、餘均抱勇敢抵抗精神、作戰到底、最可欽佩、河北、遼寗、南京、北平、湖北、靑島各隊久經訓練、實力本已可觀、其他如福建、安微、河南、山東、江西、湖南諸隊、初未經大塲合之會戰、倉卒成軍、然師出冷門、球藝一鳴驚人、若福建戰上海、河南戰南京、山東戰廣東、四川戰北平、安徽戰香港、强敵當前、成能苦戰應付、表演極爲出色、離此數較大、不足詬病也、備假以時日、予以訓練、即成勁旅、下屆全運會中相見、當有士別三日、刮目柑看之　矣、至港馬粵滬四隊爲我國足球人才所集錦、分區比賽所以增加練習興奮、發展經騐膽識、萬勿以錦標問題介意、分立門戶、要知對內能團結、庶對外能抵抗勝利、明年在柏林之世界運動會爲期日近、深願各足球隊選手歸去以後、厲兵抹馬、埋頭苦踢、爲祖國效力世界球塲、盡力博得無上光榮、他日載譽返國、斯爲今日全運會比賽鍛鍊之眞意義矣、</p>
<p>網球美中不足</p>
<p>網球錦標新制度之利弊、令已證實矣、苛責何用、凡事必須從嘗試而能成功、則吾人正因之可以謀以後之全善方法、是以今日之不良制度、無非即將來之新的創造也、</p>
<p>本屆之取消台維斯杯制度、其始爲團體錦標之外、附帶等級比賽之意義、故秩序之編配、彷彿公開比賽、同時產出個人及團體兩種錦標、而其目的、因我國向無等級比賽之舉行、挽邊國內網球技術、蒸蒸日上、爲增高球員興趣、特趁此機會、謀一舉兩得之辦法、祗以事前未審愼周詳、以致美中不足、弄巧成拙、</p>
<p>新制度中、雙打已不成問題、單打因分有第一單打及第二單打之別、而又將一二名次、歸類排列秩序、實爲最大之失策、如第一第二單打混合排置、或亦不致有此弊病、</p>
<p>明瞭原則後、宜力求其澈底、成爲純粹之公開比賽、待最後冠軍解决後、冉憑各賽員之名次、核奪其所屬單位、然後判分團體名次、如是既合乎等級比賽之原則、團體錦標、亦隨之而產生矣、</p>
<p>仍有毆打裁判</p>
<p>今日之運動會中、往往於某種權威下之運動員、趾高氣揚、無事生非、裁判受辱、大會淡然處之、裁判員乃成其爲非作惡之對象、杭州大會、實開風氣之先、南京及本屆大會、仍一再見之、裁判被毆、不了了之、大會毫無表示、身當其衝者、亦祇　於情面忍氣吞聲、而對於任意爲非之運動員、反無所表示、囂張之風、豈有寗時、</p>
<p>選手兩棲問題</p>
<p>本屆大會自競賽委員會決賽補充規程、凡選手預選跨省、須取消其本屆參加之資格、於是首先抗議者、有吳必顯之資格次後陸續產生之抗議、不一而足、抗議本規定於大會競賽規程、然其中抗議者、是否皆本諸運動精神光明正大、則不可必、甚至挾公報私或用以作報復者、亦或有其事，亦不可知、總之法律不咎旣往、　賽委員會此頃規程、用意固佳、立法嫌遲、如於下屆採用、不可糾紛、悉由此可免、</p>
<h3 id="c181">全運會期內　交通概況一斑　觀眾與汽車爲數可驚　開我國交通史新紀錄 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>大會交通組、昨發表全運會期間、交通情形、概况如下、</p>
<p>觀眾人數</p>
<p>全運會期內、參加觀衆、超過十萬人以上者、共有五天、其中以國慶日為最多、約有十八萬人、其次爲十月十八日約有十六萬人、十月十九日及二十日不過十五萬人、十月十三日則不過十萬人而已、</p>
<p>交通秩序</p>
<p>全運會期內散塲時間　除雙十節因下午四時天忽降雨、觀衆爭先登車、次序稍亂、延至下午八時半始散畢外、其餘俱於每日習武七時以前、完全散畢、卽如十月十九日、雖有觀衆十五萬人、而散塲完畢、亦不過六時半而已、</p>
<p>汽車計數</p>
<p>參加全運會之觀衆、大都自早晨八時起、卽有人陸續赴會、三塲時於下午三時以後、亦即有人絡繹返滬、戰一日之間、來往車輛、可謂甚多、但因規定路綫等種種關係、不得請爲擁擠、總計雙十節一天、自上午七時半至下午八時半、共有往來汽車約一萬二千餘輛、（詳見後表空車往返者不計在內）至於十月十九日之情形、則稍不同、因是日爲足球决賽、又爲星期六日、故觀衆赴令運會時、大都俱集中於午後十二時半至一時半、在此一小時之間、計通過小客車一千五百七十輛、大客車一百六十一輛、兩共一千七百三十一輛、（空車不計）散塲時、又皆集中於下午五時至九時半之間、俟足球决賽完全賽畢、始肯離塲、故在此半小時之內、計在翔殷路上通過小客車一千四百六十輛、大客車二百十輛、兩共一千六百七十兩、亦可謂爲在我國交通上最高之紀錄矣、</p>
<p>所剩車輛</p>
<p>至於觀衆所乘之各種車輛、人數當以小客車爲最多、大客車次之、火車又次之、例如雙十節之觀衆、乘坐小客車者、共有七萬餘人、大客車約有六萬餘人、（目用小客車在內）火車約一萬餘人、是日因國慶日、各工廠俱休假一天、故各工友之參加者、亦甚衆、惟多步行赴會、下午四時因天忽降雨、步行者愈見增多、佔計是日之步行者、約佔全部觀衆百分之五十强、至於其他日期、則步行者俱覺甚少、即十月十九日其步行者、亦不過百分之五而已、</p>

<h3 id="c188">說餓 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>前幾天，大公報旅行通信記者長江寫一段成蘭紀行；其中有一節記一餓殍的事，說：</p>
<p>「在紅橋關南，有一垂死之男子，屈股臥道旁，口唇時動；記者乃以饅頭一枚予之，其手已失知覺，眼亦不能張合自如，屢觸其手，並以饅頭置其唇鼻間，久之，彼始移手接饅頭，又久之，始以饅頭納口中。經其咬一口後，但見其全身突然顫勳，口眼大開，直視記者等，嗚嗚作聲。飢之於食，非身歷其境者，不知此中滋味也。」</p>
<p>這樣輕描淡寫寫來，如一股冷流似地直冲到我們的心眼，從前晋惠帝說飢民爲什麼不吃肉，鬧過流傳千古的笑話。光緒帝於庚子年逃難到西安去，途中久不進食，他不知怎樣的，只覺得肚子痛，也是一樣的笑話。飢餓的况味，本非身自經歷過不會知道的。娜威文學家哈姆生（Hamsun　Knut　1860-）曾經用肚子餓的題村寫了一本小說—飢餓（Hungry　1888年作）其中有幾段可與那段通信對看：</p>
<p>「…每當我挨過任何長時間的飢餓時，我的腦筋就好像悄悄地逃出我的頭蓋，只留給我一個空殼！我的頭漸漸飄浮起來，我不能感到牠在我的肩膀上的重量，而且當我觀看任何事物時，我竟故竟將我的眼睛睜得過分的大。」P.25</p>
<p>「…我懶洋洋地走下街道，在海吉哈津街的一處，在一家吃食店的門前站住，有許多食物陳列在那店舖的窗子裏。一隻猫在躺着，酣睡在一個圓形的法國面包旁邊。後面還放着一盤豬油和幾盤肉。我站了一回，注視着這些食品，但想起我沒有錢可以購買，我驟然掉轉頭去，繼續我的噣蹀。…我的腦裏忽然起了一陣大混亂。我仍舊向前踉蹌决意不去理會腦裏的混亂；但我越走越壞了，終於不得不在一個步階上坐下。我的全生命起了變化，醫師有些東西在我的內部滑倒，又髣髴我的腦網或腦臉已經撕作兩片了。」P.64</p>
<p>和這飢餓的情形相襯的還有一段寫他飢餓後大吃的情形，說：</p>
<p>「我開始大吃，越吃越饕餮，不加咀嚼地吞下成塊的肉，每口每口像一隻野獸似的吃着，并且像一個吃人的精怪似的撕肉。…完事之後，我立刻走到門邊；我已經覺得噁心了。食物開始作怪，我非常難受，片刻都忍不住了。我不得不在我所走過的，每個暗角上作嘔。我掙扎着想制住這種勢將我再成空肚的噁心；緊握着我的手，想把牠征服；在街沿上頓脚，並目嚥下，一切翻起來的東西。一切都無效，我終於跳進一個門廊，折着身體，頭向前，從我的眼睛裏迸出來的淚朮使我眼睛的迷糊了，並且大嘔了一次。我痛苦得要命，一面咽泣，一而沿着街道走去。P.166</p>
<p>飢餓的身體變化，哈姆生寫得非常眞切。最初期的一餓一，先從肚子鬧起，好像腸胃部分有什麼東西在刺似的，這便是光緒帝所謂肚子痛。再進一步，腦子脹和作嘔的症候一同發作，頭一搖動，眼前滿是一顆顆星光。大約餓了三五天，到了餓的第三期，頭軍脚輕，四肢無力，和病人一樣，口中不斷喘息。照一般情形說，飢餓總是非常痛苦的；明來被淸兵所俘虜的大臣洪承疇，準備餓死殉國；餓了幾犬，實在支持不住了，一杯米汁灌下去，使他誘起生的意欲，依舊活下去，做了滿淸的降臣。（弘一法師入山修行以前，曾經靜坐餓了二星期：據他說，心君泰然，非常舒服，那只能算是例外。）</p>
<p>飢餓在心理上變化，比身體上的變化還助複雜得多。哈姆生說一個人餓得久了，看見路人個個是仇人，即是穿一件單褂子的，在他眼裏也見得那是驕傲。這是說由飢餓激起憎恨的情緒。光緒年間，山西大飢荒；有一段新聞，說一個外省人到了那里，就被那些災民宰掉吃了，由憎恨而吃人，也是情理之中應有的事。儒家初期的聖賢，也承認一般人到了飢餓地步就不免胡爲妄動，也承認會有人相食的悲劇局面　。</p>
<p>但他們以爲一個修養有素的君子，就得在飢餓上顯出不同的操守來。禮記檀弓記一個餓昏了齊人，黔敖用憫憐的口吻招呼他，他以倔强地不吃那「嗟來之食」，終於餓死。曾子雖不贊成齊人的終於餓死，但他非常贊成齊人倔强拒絕那憫憐口吻的態度的。</p>
<p>儒家的君子，我們沒有看見過，伯夷叔齊餓死首陽山的傳說也不十分可信。三代以後，只看見一個挨餓的詩人陶淵明，有點近於儒家的理想。陶淵明歸田以後，境况大致不十分好。有一回，江州刺史檀道濟去拜訪他，他餓癟了肚子睡在床上好幾天了。檀道濟親自慰問他，餽送肉和粟米給他；他揮手拒絕，簡直不領情，他是這樣充分實踐了儒家的主張的。他又有一首乞食詩，寫他沒有飯吃時候，向鄉鄰這家那家乞食的情形。鄉鄰知道他窮苦，時常留他吃飯；詩末以「感子漂母惠，媿我非韓才。銜戢知何謝，冥報以相貽」四語結尾，他對於鄰里留飯的盛情是如何的刻骨銘心！人到負窮時，容易變成非常敏感，無端的忿怒和過分的感激，兩種情緒時常錯雜伴起。我們相信韓信的「一飯之恩，終身不忘」，和哈姆生所說的「看見路人個個是仇人」兩種心理可以並行不悖。</p>
<p>文藝是現實生活的感受；魯迅先生說；一對於人生的經騐，別的且不說；肚子餓這件事，要是歡喜，便可以試試看，只要兩天不吃飯，飯的香味便會起個特別的誘惑。」對於肚子餓一這最低限度的生活經騐都沒有的人，似乎染筆文藝，還嫌太早一點，，雖說「肚子餓」並不風雅，「閒適」。</p>
<h3 id="c189">晨 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— 流冰</p>
<p>島國的秋也許是來得分外早吧，故國的友人來信尙說：「上海天氣仍舊，游泳池還開放着哪。」而東京之晨却已凉氣襲人了。</p>
<p>跑到島國來，忽忽地又是一月了。我最愛異國的早晨，那帶着凉氣的靜穆的早晨。每天早晨，我必獨自個兒在冷寂的泥路上散步，足下踏着高高的「靴駄一，縱是泥濘也染不到脚跟了。上頭是一片暈色的天空，沒有一片雲，連一隻雲雀也沒有，寂寞的天空比寂寞的心情更寂寞了。有時，也許會有糢糊的白霧，用稀微的氣氛凝住大地，然而，那是何等無力量的氣體呵。</p>
<p>我踏着這靜寂的？晨，眺望着四周的一切，那稠密的人家，木板的房屋都還在沉睡着，祇有昨夜來冒了一晚火熖的澡堂的烟筒，還掙着疲倦的身軀，在半空里伸着臂膀。偶然有一二聲犬吠衝破了長室，但這也少能擾亂我淸靜的心情。</p>
<p>這時，過去的生活便會在寂靜的心頭飄起，和海洋中的一片孤舟一樣。那一年中的生活，是夢，是惡夢，在我周遭，圍繞着許多誘惑的毒爪，色情的音調，生活早使我失却了奮鬥的勇氣，我把自己滲在惡濁的洪流中，浮萍似的，隨波逐浪，好比在海洋中的孤舟遇到了莫大的颶風，四周都是如山的巨浪，兇湧地向身邊襲來。有時，我也想作一個掙扎，我憤怒地一聲呌號，然而這呌號却助長狂濤的奸笑，我的周圍這時是充滿着極濃的黑色的氣氛，看不見陽光，更看不到一盞星星的紅燈。</p>
<p>但是，我還有一息最後的力氣，我在心坎中發出了原始的呼喊，使我想起了祖先的力量，使我記起了自己過去的精神，「你還年輕呵！二十歲的小夥子哪！」在我心坎中，一種響亮的洪聲在警告我。於是，我睜開無神的雙眼，伸開雙臂，在黑海洋中一聲長嘯，這是原始鬭爭中衝鋒的呌喊，我重新拿起木漿，和烏黑的狂清搏廝，終於，衝出了深黑的氣氛，看見了比岸的紅燈。</p>
<p>這時，四面都放出了光明，我重新碰到了以往的弟兄，「夥伴們，我同來了！」我歡欣地吶喊着，不管他們有沒有聽見，不管是他們還用懷疑的目光投視我。然而，我是從掙扎中勝利了，我慶祝我自己，在這靜寂的微凉的晨光中。</p>
<p>回想着這鬭爭的過去，我寂寞的心情無騰沸了。周身的血液在交流。突然，半空里一聲長嘯，都市開始咆哮了，我仰頭一望，東方巳昇起了鮮明的朝陽！</p>
<p>我將踏着這微凉的晨光，數着騰沸的血脈跳勦。</p>
<h3 id="c190">名譽老婆婆（十一） <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 江馬修作任鈞譯</p>
<p>「嘿，我是勇造的替身。」老婆婆兩眼閃亮着；一號在狹仄的屋子裏揮着兩手走着，一壁就用極浮躁的聲調說：我是個伍長，功六級，名譽的戰死。嘿，大家痛快地喝吧，喝他個人仰馬翻！我簡直沒有比這還要高興的事情。名譽，名譽！啊，這是名譽，這是名譽！」</p>
<p>接着，老婆婆就用奇怪的手脚的動作，興高采烈地舞踴起來。</p>
<p>從這時候起，人們就確信：老婆婆已經眞正地發了瘋。</p>
<p>殯葬之後，燒飯老婆婆就跟從來一般地，一早就跑到我的家裏來，一直工作到夜晚。她照舊好好地工作着，別無發瘋的樣子。跟以前不同的，就是在言語中間增多了令人覺得可笑的地方　並且，坐在寄宿舍裏把貓皮」拿出來彈的事情也比從前更來得頻繁了。家裏頭的人雖然對她表示同情，但也頗覺爲難。</p>
<p>還有一種很顯著的事情，就是名譽這兩個字的濫用。名譽老婆婆這個綽號就是從這個時候開始。</p>
<p>有一次，我因爲有點事情，急急忙忙地跑到工廠那邊去。當時我一不小心，給什麼東西一絆，就跌了一交。</p>
<p>「這是名譽，這是名譽，快些起來！」</p>
<p>老婆婆在工人寄宿舍裏這　地呌着。</p>
<p>我爬起來了。膝頭擦破得很厲害，流着相宮多的血。</p>
<p>「不要緊！」老婆婆看見了這種情形更認眞地說：「名譽的負傷，舍鷄動章。」</p>
<p>這些事情還不算得什麼。這在當時，毋寗說是一般人所慣說的口頭禪。可是，老婆婆是很喜歡貓的；她時常把牠抱了起來，像是喜歡得不得了似地親着頰，對牠說着：</p>
<p>「可愛的貓兒，名譽的貓兒！」</p>
<p>依照同樣的口氣，她還迷續地使用着「名譽的花兒」，「名譽的哥兒」，「各譽的太太」等等。</p>
<p>有一天，在老婆婆的鄭近，有一個貧窮的獨身老頭兒上了吊。她就跑到我的母親跟前，把老頭兒的良善和他的貧窮而寂寞的身世，用深深的同情叙述了一番；接着，就流着眼淚，這麼說：</p>
<p>「我覺得這該多麼可憐！可是，這也是名譽啦！」</p>
<p>我的母親笑起來了。</p>
<p>「一個人吊頸死了，那是沒有什麼名譽的。」</p>
<p>『也是名譽呀。』老婆婆十分認眞地固執着自己的意見。「雖然他不是戰死的；但，却是窘死的。我覺得，這也楚名譽……」</p>
<p>「那末，」母親更加笑得厲害了。『跟你的兒子同樣，政府大槪也會發下三百兩左右的欵子給這上吊的老伯伯吧。』</p>
<p>『大概是這樣吧。眞正是一件名譽的事情。』</p>
<p>老婆婆始終認眞地說。</p>
<p>我的母親覺得很可笑。接着，母親就詳詳細細地對她說明：戰死和吊死怎樣分別，所謂名譽是怎麼一回事。但是，母親的話老婆婆却一點也沒有聽進去。她祇是這樣地說着：</p>
<p>名譽的事情！使人羨慕的事情！</p>
<h3 id="c191">午飯前後 <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— 林石</p>
<p>不到十點鐘，我使催着妻趕快燒午飯，爲的約好了　點鐘到秦先生家裏去。秦先生是新近做了官的人，我拿得穩，以後和他的交情，無論如何對我總有不小的帮助。當然囉，我不是沒有自知之明的人，我不配做官，而且我也不想做官，但是爲了救窮，給我介紹一個小小的事做，這在他該不是何等困難的吧？我想。</p>
<p>無論如何，自己失業太久了，從前年九月一直到現在。這整兩年的光陰，自信本領也並不小，僅僅靠着寫些文章零碎發表，幸運得很，一家人都還沒有餓死。可是如今却不大相同，書店有力量買稿出單行本的，固然沒有，而熱熱鬧鬧的雜誌年的雜誌，也相繼停刋了，因而即使每天不停的寫，也不能換出錢來。</p>
<p>是的，兩年來不停的寫，不停的寫，寫不出來也得寫，這使我曾經感覺到極大的苦痛。當然這是爲了一家人的生活。但是除此以外，也不完全就沒有了寫作的理由；藉寫作以點綴自己的生命，這是我畢生最主要的事業，好像是百靈島在雲層高處的叫喊，固然是牠目已生命的需要，同時也是要使人世間更加美麗些，不過這是不恰當譬喻；難道說我能自由自在的翱翔天空麼？而這世間是否又因這小小的靈雀的呌喊而美麗起來呢？正相反，我只合配作杜鵑，日夜不停的啼哭，即使在啼哭中帶着濃重的血腥也罷，告訴人們這世界是無限的妻凉，也未嘗不是我的貴任啊！再不然，我就只好是冬日抖縮花簷前的麻雀，當白雪緊裏着大地，不容許我找着一些食物來養活自己和巢裏飢餓着的孩子們，我也得吱吱的叫喊，雖則這低微的呼聲，不見得能得着空漠的人間一滴同情，然而我還是掙扎着生活下去啊！</p>
<p>這是我最後的勇氣；無論如何，我總得掙扎着生活下去。茁長在乾枯的沙漠中的小草，也算是大自然造物的善意，誰能抑壓牠生長的權利呢？不幸的是生就了倔强的個性，不幸的是祖和父遺傳給我羞恥和正義，就因這使我不合生存在這慘酷的時代了。啊！這慘酷的時代哦！多少靑年在國破家亡天災兵禍之中，被驅逐在死亡綫上，又有多少靑年失業着忍受着飢餓。</p>
<p>這些這些，近來我常是反覆的想着，今天我又在想着。</p>
<p>吃過飯，穿好了衣裳，接過妻給我做車錢的兩毛小洋，我懷着極大的希望走出門去。在路上，我看看自己的黑皮鞋擦得很亮，這是妻小心愛我之處。因這，使我立刻想起妻的話來：</p>
<p>「你給貧窮嚙傷了心，你太萎靡了。你得振作起精神，你別忘了在險上堆起笑容，當你請求朋友們給你找事的時候，不要太使人看不起我的丈夫啊！」</p>
<p>對，這句話很對，爲什麼要因着貧窮血給人家笑話呢？至少我不應該忘記自己也是一個人，我不能因貧窮而給人輕蔑與侮辱。於是我挺起胸瞠，我使勁的讓皮鞋在馬路上走得很響亮。我摸了摸新剃光了的鬍鬃和早上擦了不少凡士林的頭髮，我扮裝出紅運當頭十分滿足的模樣了。</p>
<p>到秦先生家的路途並不怎樣遙遠，憑着我如此精神抖素的一股勁兒，不要半個鐘頭便可以走到。於是我省下了電車錢，留到明天買小菜凑凑數也是好的。假使機會好，假使秦先生肯照顧我給一個職位，那末立刻坐着黃包車回來，不是更舒服而且光彩得多麼？一想到這裏，我僅遏不住心頗的高興。前幾天，我曾經在他家留下過一張字條，說明今天十二鐘當他回家吃午飯的時候，我要到他家去談談。雖則在字條上並沒有說明所談何事，可是以我和他相處三年的老友，我的失業他也知道得淸淸楚楚的，難道他還會不懂得我的用意麼</p>
<p>不管在那一方面說，秦先生眞是了解我的好友。失業後他曾經借給我一筆很大的欵子，當他還沒有做官的時候；直到如今還沒有歸還，想來心頭眞有點過意不去。不過只要有了職業我便首先歸還他的借欵，雖則他也未必就等着這一筆錢用。</p>
<p>不久，我走到了掛有小鸚哥的秦先生家的門口了。撳過電鈴，走進客廳，脚踏在軟茸茸的地毯上。可是他還沒回來，秦太太殷勤的招待我在絲絨的長梭發上坐下。他新近租了這家新式的洋房，壁上的裝飾和屋內的陳列，都十分講究。我隨手翻閱着几上的畫報，我耐心的等着他回來。</p>
<p>太概總有二十分鐘吧，秦先生來了電話；爲了要赴宴會，他不回家吃午飯了。這使我立刻給憂愁襲上了心頭。其後秦太太讓我在電話裏和他談話了，我說：</p>
<p>「秦先生，你不回來麼？我在等着你哩。」</p>
<p>「你好哇！」他的聲音仍是那般明朗的。「因爲有一點事，我不能回來。你有什麼事跟找說呢？」</p>
<p>「沒什麼，不過隨便談談。」我羞澀着，我怎麼好直說呢？到後來我到底大膽的告訴他了，他說：</p>
<p>「你找過別人給你想法子麼？」</p>
<p>「找過很多人，誰都沒辦法……」</p>
<p>「可是我也沒有辦法呀！」他的聲音很響；「好，以後冉談罷。」</p>
<p>我瑟縮的走出他家的大門，架上的小鸚哥似乎對我苦笑了一下。我覺得脚很疲倦，但是我還是走回家。不管怎樣，我還要生活下去，兩毛小洋留下明天買小菜總是够的呀。</p>

<p>— 月祺</p>
<p>最初應用「以說」的故事</p>
<p>——醫學故事之十一——</p>
<p>一八四六年十月十六日，是一個値得紀念的偉大的日子。不信，謂看下面安琪爾博士（Dr·G·M·Angell）所記的故事。</p>
<p>故事發生的地點，是在波士頓的麻省醫院（Massachu　Setts　General　Hospital。這是創辦於一八一一年在美國有悠久歷史的一個醫院。當時主持外科者是華倫博士（Dr·John　Warren），兼任哈佛大學外科教授。</p>
<p>一八四六年冬季，波士頓的醫校學生，聽到一個消息：有人發明一種麻醉劑，可以免除病人被施外科手術時的痛苦。後來，他們又聽到一個消息：麻省醫院的華倫博士將在截斷病人大腿時應用這麻醉劑。這消息不久傳布全城報紙，引起內外科醫生界的討論。在那時以前，被試騐過的麻醉劑，巳有數種，但有的只適用於拔牙，有的完全失敗。直到那時爲止，對於大手術完全適用的麻醉劑，實際上尙來發明。這消息引起熱烈的興味，當　是意中事。</p>
<p>「在十月十六日那天早晨」，安琪爾博士說，「我照常跑到醫院裏去，但比平常早得多，因爲從華倫博士的名譽和這一次試騐的重要性推測，我斷定到塲參觀的人一定很多。</p>
<p>「我走到時，醫院門口已擁擠着一大隊人，隊尾直伸到街上，大門還關閉着，要等到一定的時間纔開。我帶領一個學生打便門走進，一直跑進手術室，揀選了座位，就坐在那兒等候。手術室的布置，如圓劇塲一股，三面排列接連幾排座位，座位前面圍以攔桿，欄桿裏面是一座手術臺，後面有門通醫院的病房。</p>
<p>「我和我的伴侶的座位，是在最前一排，正對着手術毫。這時候，門外的軍衆越聚越多；大門開時，如潮一般擁進圓劇塲裏面，坐得密不通風，還有許多找不到位置，只好站着等候。</p>
<p>「不久，華倫博士走進來，後面跟着一個靑年。靑年手中握着一隻玻璃球，大槪八时直徑，頂端有嘴，用木槍塞住，裏面盛透明的液體；我們不知道這是什麼東西。</p>
<p>我個人不認識這位靑年；鄰座的耳語傳到我的耳中，我纔知道他就是這一次將被試騐的新麻醉劑的發明者麼爾登博士（Dr.Morton）。</p>
<p>「過了片刻，侍者把受手術的病人送來，放在手術檯上。這病人是一個女子，年紀約莫二十四五歲。三個年靑實習生並排站在華倫博士的對面，摩爾登博士靠欄站着，離我們的座位不過數呎，手中握着那盛透明液體的玻璃球。」</p>
<p>華倫博士開始討論病狀。他說明病人患的是膝關節坐骨疽。他陳說種種緩和痛苦的療治方法都替那病人施用過，但都沒有效騐。因此，那病人非給截斷大腿不可。他已對那病人解釋過，曉諭他非如此就沒有辦法，而且已得到病人的同意。</p>
<p>華倫博士如此說時，全塲肅靜無嘩。從最前一排到最後一排，聽不到一聲低微的耳語，也聽不到用鉛筆寫字的聲音。</p>
<p>華倫博士緩緩地旋轉頭來，面對着觀衆，用格外嚴肅的音調說道：</p>

<p>第二章　鴉片在醫學上之價值</p>
<p>鴉片在藥物學上。的確佔重要之地位。其奏效迅速。治療奇騐。他藥每嘆勿如。用得其當。病者無不驚爲神異。否則流弊滋多。不堪設想。論鴉片之效用。少量則興奮。大量則麻醉。過是則發生急性中毒。時時服用。則成慢性中毒。卽上章所述吸後種種之現象也。</p>
<p>醫師對於鴉片之應用。務宜審慎周祥。偶一玩忽。卽易中毒。小兒服用。更宜注意。報載小兒痢疾二往往用烟灰致死。此皆不明鴉片藥理所致。至鴉片在醫學上之價値。只一種治標念救之良藥。論其根本治療效力。甚覺徵少。驟聆此言。每疑不確。但一考其實。鮮有不易於了解者。譬諸治咳。吾人可用鴉片以制之。然根本治療。非用祛痰劑不可。又如腹痛。亦可用鴉片以治之。但欲防其後發。須用疏洩淸腸之法。由此觀之。鴉片效用。只可爲根本治療之副劑。不能任獨當一面之主藥。如果反其道而行之。專用鴉片以治病。其結果未有不遭癮已成而病尙未去之痛苦。此固以烟治病若所宜熟思深慮者也。鴉片旣非根本治療之良藥。但其急救治標之功。在醫學上有不可磨滅之成蹟。蓋當急病發生時。（如劇痛之類）。非用麻醉藥。無以解片刻之危。否則患者正呻吟之不暇。一切檢查治療。竟無從進行焉。</p>
<p>又鴉片富於習慣性。故只能限於短時期應用。如果服用稍久。進而成慢性中毒。與吸烟無異也。旣成慘性中毒。則向之功用。漸漸减退。起初甩大量後。尙能收片刻之功。及烟癮日深。雖用强烈藥品。亦不易見動。故醫者對癮深者。於需要急救時。苦無良策。職是故耳。現將鴉片功效。分列於後。</p>
<p>（一）疼痛　凡一切大小手術後疼痛及胃痛腹痛等。均易制止。惟頭痛則無效。</p>
<p>（二）洩瀉　鴉片有停止胃腸端動作用。故可用爲止瀉劑。</p>
<p>（三）氣喘咳嗽　鴉片有平氣止咳之功。</p>
<p>（四）失眠　因疼痛而起之失眠。爲最有效</p>
<p>（五）神經刺激　對於大腦刺激。如羊癲瘋腦痙擊毒等。均有奇效。</p>
<p>（六）內臟出血　如肺出血及胃腸出血。因鴉片有减少內臟動作效能。故醫界多採爲止血副劑。</p>
<p>第三章　戒烟方法</p>
<p>戒烟方法甚多。大抵均能靈騐。有時雖仙水符咒。亦有戒絕之可能。有時雖眞正科學方法。亦告失敗。無他。蓋鴉片係神經毒質。吸者心理。最易變化莫測。往往因極小之挫折。墮大功於一旦。或疑懼戒後疾病。優柔寡斷。或憧憬於吸時快樂。無戒絕决心。此種心理。不但躊躇於將戒未戒之時。而且常常發生於旣戒之後。故醫者第一須了解吸者心理。宜時時鼓其勇氣。作戒絕之决心。而受戒者。亦當以十二分信仰心。接受醫師指導。則戒烟進行。事半而功倍矣。</p>
<p>戒烟是否痛苦。爲吸者中最關心問題之一。但詢諸一升。每苦於環境。不能詳言直道。何則。蓋道其所長。（如報載全無痛苦。照常工作。精神煥發等）則將來痛苦發生。不免貽欺人誇大之磯。道其所短。（如戒後種種不適現象）。則益增吸者疑懼。不敢作戒烟之嘗試。然論其實際。在戒期中。必有不舒適發生。此固無庸諱言者。如果暫忍須叟。則將來總有苦盡甘來之一日。此戒者所宜深切了解者也。</p>

<p>潰爛性口腔炎的原因。多爲傳染及中毒。在傳染性的時侯。則如兵營，監獄，孤兒院等羣居雜處。容易發生本病。在中毒的時候。則多由內服水銀劑而發。此時特稱之爲汞毒性口腔炎。臨床上屢可遇見。至於由鉛，燐，砒石，及銅等中毒。則較少。又若貧血，衰弱，肺癆，糖尿病，壞血病，腺病及佝僂病等患者。亦易罹本病。</p>
<p>本病的主要症候。就是在下顎的齒齦粘膜首先發生壞死。漸次波及口唇及類部因粘膜。這種齒齦變化。當以在重症汞毒性口腔炎的時候最爲着明。潰瘍發生時。大都附有豚膿樣物。齒齦紅腫。容易出血。齒齦緣的粘膜。一旦發生壞死及潰瘍後。齒牙常可因此引起搖動。甚者竟可脫落。唾液的分泌。特別旺盛。顎下，頸部等淋巴腺。亦多來腫脹。並發口腔惡臭。患者口內。大都威覺疼痛。所以飲食亦感困難。本病的經過。約在八日至十四日。牠的治療。與加答兒性口腔炎的治療。大略相同。</p>
<p>（第三）亞布答性口腔炎</p>
<p>亞布答性口腔炎，常爲流行性。虛弱的小兒。最易發生。牠的主要原因。多由口腔不潔及小兒在第一生齒期中口腔粘膜所受銳牙的刺戟。此外肺炎，傷寒，麻疹，猩紅熱等傳染病的經過中及婦女月經，產褥，及授乳的時候。亦常發本病。</p>
<p>本病的主要症候。卽在口腔粘膜發生黃色或灰白色斑。大若帽針頭火。或如扁豆大。稍形隆起。周圍且有深紅色的暈。這種斑點發生最多的部位。當以舌緣及舌繫帶。而口唇及頰粘膜則較少。斑點一般緊密固着於粘膜面。所以剝離非常困難。若行强剝。則來出血。患者口內，大都感覺灼熱，乾燥，疼痛，及唾液分泌旺盛。飮食當然亦生困難。此外有可注意的。就是在小兒，往往容易發生高熱。本病的經過。約爲一二屋期。但易再發。牠的治療方針。也是淸潔口腔，避免刺戟，及勤施藥水漱口（在小兒則洗口。）</p>

<p>— 林鑑賢</p>
<p>（第二六問）永久牙比乳牙多幾只牙齒？</p>
<p>（答）別的都是一樣，就是每邊比乳牙多三只臼牙，共計多十二只牙齒。</p>
<p>（第二七問）很多中年人的牙齒，沒有三十二只，要少一二只或二三只不等，什麼緣故？</p>
<p>（答）這是頂裏邊的第三大臼牙，還沒有長出來的綠故。這牙齒往往埋伏在肉底下牙床骨裏。有時候竟至三四十歲方纔出來的。這牙齒將來還要論及。</p>
<p>（第二八問）永久牙各個有各個的功用嗎？</p>
<p>（答）大槪門牙用來咬切食物，所以牠像鑿子樣尖：大牙用來撕扯食物，所以牠像圓錐體樣尖；臼牙用來壓磨食物，所以牠的咬合面大而且像磨子般有凹凸紋。對於咀嚼的功用講起來，臼牙要算最要緊了。所以臼牙應該加意保護。不可任牠蛀壞。</p>
<p>（第二九問）曰牙之中那只頂關緊要？</p>
<p>（答）就是第一大臼齒。在牙床左右上下每邊都有一只。可算是牙床弓的柱石。牠若蛀壞脫落，其他的永久牙，都很容易疏離。以致傾斜不正，容易蛀壞。而且咀嚼困難。兼之下頦要退縮，面孔變爲不端正。所以這臼牙，不可任其蛀壞失掉。做父母的不可誤認牠是暫時的乳牙牙，不去注意牠</p>
<p>（第三十問）第一大臼牙怎樣能够不致誤認爲乳牙？</p>
<p>（答）（一）牠是六歲時候方纔出的（所以尋常稱爲六歲臼牙）。（二）牠是緊靠着乳後臼牙裏邊長的，若是小孩口內發現三只臼牙，這頂裏邊的（從中門牙算起接連的第六只）就是牠無疑了。（三）牠較乳臼牙爲潔白壯大。從這三點上就可以不致誤認牠是乳牙。</p>
<p>（第三一問）永久牙蛙壞失落後，或拔去後，還有牙齒長出來替代牠嗎？</p>
<p>（答）永久牙失落後，决無牙齒再會長出來的，所以永久牙應該寳貴。</p>
<p>第三章　牙齒的組織和部份，</p>
<p>（第三二問）牙齒怎樣生成的？</p>
<p>（答）牙齒可以說同指甲毛髮一樣從表皮細胞生長的。我們口內的粘膜，就是一層表皮。牠裏面有一種成齒細胞。起初是軟組織，後來漸漸的石灰化，變爲硬的骨質，就成爲牙齒了。</p>
<p>（第三三問）牙齒從頭至脚可以分做幾段？</p>
<p>（答）約可分三段：（一）牙冠，約占全長三分之一，是露在牙肉外面的。（二）牙頸，是在牙肉邊綠的地位。（三）牙脚，是埋嵌在齒槽窩裏的。</p>
<p>（第三四問）牙齒有幾隻牙腳？</p>
<p>（答）門牙犬牙和小臼牙，都只有一隻牙脚（有時候上顎小臼牙有二隻（牙脚）。下顎大臼牙有二隻牙脚。上顎大臼牙有三隻牙脚。但亦有很多例外的。</p>
<p>（第三五問）牙齒可以分做幾層？</p>
<p>（答）可以分做三層，主要的部分：最外面的一層是牙磁。第二層是牙質。最中間的是牙髓。</p>
<h3 id="c197">止痛的醫學（三七） <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 李興</p>
<p>這一類藥是可以用的但宜注意止痛第一應當除去疼痛的原因，去掉了原因痛停後就不會再發。若不求去原因而單求鎭痛其實際不過是等於揚湯止沸。那末，一面去病原，一面於痛時服用一定多少的鎭痛藥也是合於醫學的。注意有時用別種有益無害的療法，如用熱法，水療，透熱電療等較勝於服鎭痛藥。服用鎭痛藥宜作臨時或最短期救濟法：例如，半夜發生頭痛，可以服北痛藥，但次日就當求根本治療頭痛，而不宜每次頭痛每次祗知服用止痛藥。鎭痛藥並不會治好病，不過是一時壓抑疼痛的知覺。還有一層，鎭痛藥用的不多於身體雖沒有特別害處。但也沒有益處。長久內服却是於身有害的。所以用鎭痛藥類是一種治標的辦法，並不是治本的辦法。依照這些原則去用鎭痛藥類可以得到益處，但若馬馬虎虎的服用鎭痛藥類結果必定是利害兼半。茲分別略述鎭痛藥類於下：</p>
<p>柳酸化合物</p>
<p>這一類藥物中最要緊的爲：（一）柳酸鈉，（二）醋柳酸（卽阿司匹雲），（三）柳酸一烷（卽冬綠油），（四）辛曲分。攏統講起來，這一類藥物除鎭痛作用外如不服過多沒有什麼特別毒性，這些藥物也兼有退熱作用。這些藥物多用於風濕病與念性神經痛，急性骨節炎等，對於其餘慢性痛病這些藥物不見有特別功效。</p>
<p>柳酸鈉　多用於急性骨節炎與風濕痛，用之得當功效很大。注意對於由心職炎發生的風濕痛這種藥品祗能臨時止痛退熱但停服後還會復發，因此藥不能醫好心臟炎。內服過量就要有惡心嘔吐，耳鳴等症象，藥停服後這些附帶作用也就停止。內服過量也可以壓抑神經系，呼吸系，或壓抑血流而發生虛脫，有時也可發生小產。普通劑量由一公分起。與小蘇打混服最宜。</p>
<p>阿司匹靈　爲鎭痛藥中之最著者，用於止頭痛，神經痛，風濕痛等有相當效力。阿司匹靈除鎭痛作用外亦有退熱作用。其鎭痛作用大槪是由於壓抑感覺，其退熱作用爲减低身體新陳代謝與加增身體熱量放散。每次內服效力最久可達數小時，過後必須冉服。用於臨時鎭痛是可以行的，但常久服用是不合道理的。用這種藥可說是治標至於治本選必須查出疼痛的原因然後對症治療。例如，牙痛或頭痛臨時服用是屬於正當的辦法，但每次牙痛或每次頭痛完全靠這些藥來醫治就是不對的，因爲先明白了原因，然後去掉病源才可以永久不痛。若是不去掉病源痛還可隨時復發。那末不求去病的原因而長久內服這些藥品自不免是無謂的敷衍。例如，頭痛的原因是梅毒痛，當痛極時服用鎭痛藥也是合理的，但根本的治法選是注射梅毒專藥。</p>
<p>柳酸一烷（冬綠油）與柳酸鈉藥性相似。外擦於腫痛處，如骨節炎，神經炎也有鎭痛效力。內服亦可以鎭痛，但毒性較烈。外擦劑以此藥一分混橄欖油二分爲量宜。此藥不必內服，如內服一次達到一英兩可以發生性命危險。</p>
<p>辛曲分（亦稱阿妥反）與柳酸鈉，阿司匹靈爲同性亦用於止痛。新辛曲分也是相同。用此藥量勿過多，時勿過久，因附帶作用毒性很嚴重。</p>
<h3 id="c198">肺結核淺說（七一） <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>第十二章　肺結核之治療</p>
<p>第三節　安靜與營養</p>
<p>退一步說，作算是適應於高山療養了，我們千萬不要過分迷信此處之氣候，對本症有不可思議之功效，這一種觀念是完全錯誤的。因爲一切肺結核患者，是决沒有共同奏效之氣候的；如果有這種話喧傳，一定係「項莊舞劍」，「醉翁之意不在酒」，我們應該認明纔好。醫者勸告患者轉地之目的，亦非僅信賴轉地所在之氣候，乃欲使患者能正確履行衛生療養原則，尤不可忘者，則空氣療法之規則是已。復次，患者一離開家庭，則平常有碍療養之種種惡習慣，環境的刺激，都可完全改良，有益於病症前途殊匪淺鮮的。如果捨此兩者，而專賴氣候以求良效，那當然使惠者非常失望的。</p>
<p>然則轉地療養的眞正價値究竟何在呢？在早期浸潤，增生性和硬變性的型式（雖擴大性亦無關），都可見功效的。對於熱度之减低，及减除，以及食慾之亢進，尤來得顯著；其他一切症象，也可因之而輕减的。</p>
<p>平常因個人經濟能力而不能轉地療養的患者，爲數當然是非常之多的，但千萬不必悲觀。如果在自宅或鄉里附近，以十分之注意，嚴密遵守各種療養規則，其收效並不一定减於轉地療養的患者。因爲儘數其他的種種，都有富貴貧賤之分，但自然界待通確是一視同仁的；所謂新鮮空氣，係無論何人都可享受，並無須物質上之報酬的！這一點眞理，我敬謹獻給本書的讀者們！</p>

<h3 id="c199">反廢婢運動 <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— 吹</p>
<p>前日本埠增刊中，發表夢若君「廢婢運動」一文，讀之非常動聽，但仔細替他想想，這些都是大廳上冠冕堂皇的話，並不是內室裏肺腑的談心，中國人喜歡「打官話」，卽是此類，我這裏把蓄婢的問題，先提出兩點來問一問：</p>
<p>一，那一家的父母，對於女兒不是肉肉寶寶，而情願賣給人家做婢女的？</p>
<p>二，凡做婢女的，是否個個都被主人虐待，像天津某小姐一樣？</p>
<p>假定說，不，我有幾句閒話要說，貧困夫妻，粥飯不飽，但是性慾衝動，不能不去解決，因此就闖下了彌天大禍，產生了此種孽障，要弄死呢？不忍，養活呢？不能，不得已，就賣掉這一塊心頭肉，旣可以養活女兒，又可以養活自己，而蓄婢之制由此而生。</p>
<p>至於人家蓄養婢女，亦有道理，本來欲用僕人，而僕人雖用，若有婢女可買，旣得有人使喚，又可救人的急，原是一舉兩便，並不見得因為心煩手癢，沒有出氣的地方，去買個婢女來百般虐待，痛打一番，大罵一番，以洩洩肚中的烏氣，果如此，我憑他人可買婢女，而夢若君不能蓄婢女，何以故？欲把婢女洩氣故。</p>
<p>虐待婢女的事，雖曾有所聞，但此種主人，都是暴戾成性，若堂子裏老鴇然，天津的某小姐然，不然，蓄婢人家，何止萬計，而虐待的事，究較少數，不能說某省發生一逆倫案，而謂某省人多是弑父者。某地發生一謀殺親夫案，而謂某地婦人多是謀殺親夫者，此種推論，未免不倫，如此天津某小姐雖然虐婢，而不能謂蓄婢者多若天津某小姐，並且暴戾成性的人，不但婢女要虐待便是僕人亦要虐待，不但僕人要虐待，便是公婆媳婦多要虐待，假定因為有了虐待僕人，虐待翁姑媳婦的事發生，難道便把主僕之制，翁姑媳婦之制，一齊打消？恐亦萬無是埋。</p>
<p>蓄婢制度四字，本來不且當，蓄婢只有習慣，沒有制度。凡所謂制度者，多含有法律性的，或強制性的，現在政府雖沒有禁止蓄婢的明文，但亦沒有獎勵蓄婢的辦法，這都是民間的習慣和需要所結合的一種賣買行為，若說制度，我便認為絕好制度，旣可以救窮，復得以自便。</p>
<p>夢若君又說，在消極方，須從救　婢女入手，我以為這到是積極方面，並不是消極方面，不過夢若君對於救濟婢女的唯一辦法，僅僅是設一婢女救濟所，收容一般不願為婢，或被虐待的婢女我恐還嫌不夠，因為要救濟婢女，先要使婢女的父母得救，則蓄婢之制，自然打消，然試問現在國家的財政如此，地方的財政如此，社會的現象又如此。是否可有辦法。本埠的荐頭行中，老媽子多得幾無立足之地，我想若蓄婢之制可以公開，販賣婢女的行裏，亦必同樣的生意興隆，故我要請夢若君先去認識社會現象，再來作廢婢運動。</p>

<h3 id="c200">寂寞的歌 <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— 士希</p>
<p>我感覺的是這麼的寂寞，尤其是在每個面對着孤燈憂鬱的時辰。</p>
<p>好像是去年的事吧，我從故鄉的血掌中蕩了出來，疲憊伴着飢餓，流浪着：從這個角落到另一個角落，又從另一個角落到這個角落，好像是一隻披滿征麝的駱駝在邁向着曠漠的西伯利亞平原。</p>
<p>在××因一個偶然的機會，便和一個久別的友人碰上。她是一個面孔圓胖，身材短小，說話時總帶着幾分笑意，而且往住眯着眼晴，快活的人。對於事事物物她總是抱着樂觀的態度面對着的。她是一個認爲世間沒有不完美的事的定命論者；但是那回的見面她却很快地便暴露着她底主觀的動搖了。她開始學會了皺眉頭，苦笑和憂慮了。</p>
<p>在一條陰暗的馬路上，伴着瘦影我們輕步的走着。她輕輕的咳着，抬起頭來望那淡漠的燈光怔忡一下，又陰冷的笑着，才憂鬱地向我說道：</p>
<p>「朋友！眞的你也變了，變得這麼憂鬱，沉靜……」</p>
<p>我仍低頭默默的跨開步走着，皮鞋釘敲在水門汀上有節奏地，輕巧而又嘹亮地呌着。聲音在這灰老而寂靜的街上顯的是這麼的陰鬱，凄淸！……</p>
<p>海面上舒散地揚過了陣微風，帶着潮濕和冷意。</p>
<p>她輕輕的打了個冷噤，於是又憤憤的接連打了幾個很嚮的呵欠。沉默了好一會，她那片長的懊惱的聲調又在寂靜里抖動着了。</p>
<p>「這幾年來生活的磨折，我又何嘗不變呢，眞的，有時我不但覺出了自己是這麼憂鬱，而且寂寞着。……」接着又是一個沉長的嘆息。</p>
<p>「有人說：寂寞好像是人體中一條看不見的蛀虫，隨着生活的波動而啃蝕了每個年靑人底心。……」她剛說到這兒又唏噓起來，感傷地搖着頭。</p>
<p>從海邊的漁船上揚過來了一陣抑悒而又寂寞的歌，聲調里帶着可怕的憂鬱和凄凉。</p>
<p>我底心緒開始有點迷亂了，低聲地喃着：「這時有？……」</p>
<p>她忙接下道：「也許已有九點鐘左右了！」</p>
<p>「我該回旅館去了！」我默默的說着，便止住了步。</p>
<p>「急什麼？」她着急地喊着。</p>
<p>我們這樣沉默地走着，有了好幾分鐘的光景，她才突然地像想起了什麼重要事情似的，低聲問我道：「有時你感到了寂寞，我底好朋友，會不想到自殺？」又鄭重地向我投着探詢的眼光。</p>
<p>「不！」我搖了搖頭，又接下「我祇渴望着唱唱寂寞的歌！」</p>
<p>海邊又嗚嗚咽咽的揚過了陣歌聲，她感動地抬起頭向寬曠的天野怔忡着，半天，才低低的嘆息道：「就是那！寂寞的歌？」眼淚便撲索地抖落下來。</p>
<p>第二天我離開了××，從此我們便沒有再見面的機會。到了上海我還接到了她一對簡短而充滿熱力的信，她說：「朋友！你底話是對的，寂寞是可怕的；然而我也開始學會了唱着那——寂寞的歌！……」</p>
<p>我沒回她信，也沒再接到她底信，後來接到另一個友人來的消息，才知道她被捕了。</p>
<p>寂寞的人們在寂寞的歌聲里老了，死滅了；然而，我却仍伴着它邁進在這人生曠漠的原野中。</p>
<h3 id="c201">煙般的心情 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 胡思</p>
<p>當心境陷入完全的空洞的時侯，那心腔是會變成直空般地冷漠與空虛的。這時，世界好像完全毀滅，而自己，像把人掛在半空般地，上旣不觸天空，下也不接實地，搖搖擺擺，毫無着落。什麼都不能感覺，什麼也都引不起趣感，人像僵死了般地。</p>
<p>碰着這種心情，只有一支香煙可以把它救轉來，別的似乎都沒有辦法。煙，可以刺激人的神經：煙，可以把一個死了的人救活起來。人，在香煙繚繞，滿眼迷濛的當兒，倒會把腦筋弄淸醒的。這，聽起來似乎有點奇特，說起來倒也并不覺得奇怪。人生是輕煙般地，飄，飄，消失了，於是心是幻滅了，死了。當人在煙香裊裊之中，看那一個一個的煙圈從喉頭吐出來，從心底跳出來，於是向上飄，向上飄；於是圈兒漸漸擴大：於是脤破了；於是香煙躱向屋角，飄出窗外，昇上屋頂：在空中，香煙於是完全看不見，完全消滅了；於是幻滅的心情一覺悟到人生也像輕煙般地：從奮鬥，拼命，向上爬而進展，煥發，而跌落，而失敗，而完全幼滅了。人是會從此中醒轉過來的。</p>
<p>佛家的道理我不深悉，我無從得到信心的佩服，然而一篇叫做「煙」的小說］却有時會令人同感的。雖然我們是二十世紀，我們離「煙」的時代已經差得很遠，我們的背境不同，我們的腦筋也不同。然而「煙」般的心情我們是可以嘗味得到的，因爲我們對它熟識，因爲我們還有時會與它同威，因爲我們和「煙」的時代還不至十分隔膜，或許我們還不能够超越「煙」前時代吧？</p>
<p>讀「煙」的時候是許多年前的事了，那時年紀太輕，人生的經騐也太少，讀起來不大懂，現在，踏入「我們的世界」是頗久了，於是爬，爬，於是碰壁，碰壁；於是被刺傷了：於是幻滅了。於是，煙圈使我覺悟起來；於是，久被藏諸腦角的「煙」，被回味起來，并且被同感起來。這，或許便是佛敎所以至今不變，佛理所以總有人研究和崇拜的緣故吧？</p>
<p>可是，從煙般的心情覺醒之後，又怎標呢？再吐一口煙麼？再讓心飄，飄麼？再看一個個的煙圈自長成以至消滅麼？這便是說，再在人世上爬，爬，然後再跌落來；然後再負上滿身的創傷，再爬，再跌，跌了又爬，爬了又跌麼？人眞眞是傻子呀！</p>
<p>什麼是「萬物之靈」呢？什麼才是眞正進步的人類呀？</p>
<p>再看煙吧！你看它燒，燒，一個煙圈又一個煙圈；一段煙末化成火燼了，又繼以另一段煙末；前一點火熄了，又繼以後一點火。……然後，煙完了，火完全熄滅了，一段香煙屁股被拋在地下。在地上，它焚，它還吐着煙絲綫兒，防後它完全完了！</p>
<p>煙完了，空虛的心已并不空虛了。心，從火柴點着香煙頭起，到完全熄滅止，已經經過了一段歷程；，人，已經經騐過人生的一週了。</p>
<p>於是，夢會頓然醒起來。</p>
<p>人，果像煙麼？煙終必消滅，然而可以繼以第二支香煙。面人類呢？人類有精蟲，有歷史，有簿籍，有斧頭，也有機器。</p>
<p>心情果永遠沈浸在煙圈中麼？</p>
<h3 id="c202">荻海之夜 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 艾荼</p>
<p>到長沙的那一個晚上，朋友們就要拉我過海到荻海那兒去。當然，我的心情是近於旅行的，對於新鮮的地方沒有</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>不去跑一回的，何況這是很有名的生菒市塲。對於我更是再好沒有了。</p>
<p>喫過了晚飯，跟朋友們一拐一拐的出了高昂的樓子的門檻——這是長沙唯一的有名的學校了。那時夕陽還透着一絲兒的光芒，把長沙洲從海面到靜寂的園子間都打成一片慘淡的殘紅，雖然這樣的光彩是適宜於悲哀的詩人的感官的，但是，在我自己卻感不到什麼，這一次南歸以後，對於自己的家毫沒有一點兒趣味，甚至連回去一趟的兩個鐘頭的時間也不想回去的。這樣的紛亂的家庭對於我是沒有懷戀的。所以，我在南歸以後，我依然像在上海的時候一樣流浪着，沒有什麼悲哀逗留在心懷裏的。</p>
<p>那裏夕陽的殘紅廣漠地照耀着那生滿了碧綠的荷葉的池面，也照射着池邊的綠葉和竹林間，那反映出來的幽靜的樣子特別令人想起了在靜寂的鄉村有如囚獄裏的幽靈，這，卻不知道那熱情奔放的詩人和悲哀的詩人用什麼句子描劃在他仙的筆尖上呢？</p>
<p>我們還愛着一點兒孩子氣的輕囂，談談笑笑的先跨上了新昌埠的步頭。新昌的街頭已經高高地吊着淡黃色的電燈了，那是夜的來臨的警示吧！可是！我卻很高興的，在那不怎麼熱門的士敏士的馬絡上跑着的時候還幻夢一樣的想着怎麼來消磨了這個夜裏－因為，這個夜裏對於我太興奮了，我一定不會好好地睡着去的，所以，我只卻望能夠在這樣別具風味的街頭或者是黑沉沉的海面挨過了這幽靜的夜。</p>
<p>從新昌的西部向着東部跑了許多，陰淡的街燈還很沉默地照射着我們。到了渡荻海的古舊的步頭的時候，我已感到兩個世界的一樣。</p>
<p>這兒的埠頭是那麼黑沉沉的呀！凹凸不平的路上，滿了五塊，殘礫，有點兒近乎沙灘似的。但是，許多許多人都打這兒來來去去，都很自然而迅速的。倒使我感到自己太生疏了。跨上了小艇。看哪！那一邊是荻海岸上的街頭，店鋪裏透出來的燈光返照在清靜的水面，輕微的波濤在盪漾的時候，那燈光的影子也在海底蘯漾，由清楚而迷朦了，遠遠的，那灰色或魄的壁壘，使人相信這半新半舊的小城是一個很好的戰爭的地盤。天空上，黑蔚色的，明朗的疏星，閃呀閃的在透露着可愛的光芒，於是，反映在海里也是一點一點的，無數的小燈盞似的。一個半彎的月兒，像少女的含羞似地躲在灰色的輕浮的雲層里，艇兒在海面盪着，輕波也起伏着，於是，我們更相信月兒跌在深海里一樣晃動着了。</p>
<p>到了荻海的市街，這兒跟別些城市不兩樣的，而且地方也不少，來來去去的人也很多，眞的，這小埠也最熱鬧的，街頭賣者，還有，小販也特別多，這兒是台山西南角的一個繁盛的區域，所以。在夜里，有點兒好像「不夜城」一樣的。</p>
<p>可是，市街的熱鬧與不熱鬧，對於在沒有多大的感想和留戀的，所以，我們跑夠了就帶了一些菓子又跨上了小艇兒，這時，我們眞的要做一次海上的夜裏有趣的泛舟了。</p>
<p>在荻海的海面，是那麼沉靜的呀！那里，宇宙裏裏好像已埋進了死般的園子裏一樣，而我們所聽到的只是櫓聲和水聲，天上的月兒卻更要朦朧了起來。我們知道，這已很夜深的時候了，舟子也要睡覺了。於是，靜靜地，掉向我們的家裏的步頭去。</p>

<p>(London) British Ambassador to Rome, Sir Eric Drummond, recently held talks with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and reiterated Britain's stance on the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. According to a Foreign Office statement issued today, Sir Drummond visited the Italian Prime Minister on Friday and reiterated that Britain, apart from the collective obligations incumbent upon a loyal member of the League of Nations, or those decided by the League of Nations in accordance with the provisions of the Covenant, is unwilling to take separate action and explained that Britain's attitude towards this case is not for its own benefit. All rumors are baseless and are spread by those who mistranslate the news or gloat over disasters. Rome also issued a similar statement. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The situation of Prime Minister Mussolini's talk with British Ambassador Sir Eric Drummond yesterday has been announced. Sir Eric Drummond again assured the Prime Minister that Britain, with the status of a faithful member of the League of Nations, undertakes collective obligations, and apart from the actions taken to fulfill these obligations and the actions recommended by the League of Nations in accordance with the Covenant, Britain is unwilling to take separate action, and stated that Britain's stance on the Italo-Abyssinian dispute is not related to its own interests. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>Rome Expresses Satisfaction</p>
<p>(Rome) According to officials, after British Ambassador Sir Eric Drummond explained Britain's attitude to Prime Minister Mussolini yesterday, the Italian government and people expressed their satisfaction, believing that the two countries will be more understanding in the future. The purpose of Drummond's visit was to clarify the situation in the Mediterranean, and now the situation there has indeed eased. Britain and Italy will continue to hold talks. Officials believe that Sir Drummond may not have made concrete proposals yesterday, but both sides have the possibility of reaching a solution. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>British-Italian Continued Talks</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare recently held secret talks with Italian Ambassador Count Grandi, and jointly considered the issue of withdrawing a portion of the Italian troops stationed in Libya, Africa, and the recall of two British warships, HMS Renown and HMS Hotham, from the Strait of Gibraltar to their home country. Generally, since the French government has agreed to provide assistance once the British Navy is attacked in the Mediterranean, the British move to recall warships is quite possible. According to sources from this agency, Britain will not demand that Italy withdraw all its troops stationed in Libya, but will request them to be moved away from the Egyptian border. In addition, Hoare and Grandi also discussed Italy's minimum conditions for peace. It is heard that these peace talks will proceed as quickly as possible, because Mussolini has said that if the Italian army continues to advance, the conditions put forward by Italy will increase accordingly. It is generally believed that when an international trusteeship system is established in the Abyssinian province of Ogaden and its headquarters in the future (referring to the League of Nations' mandate), difficulties will arise if Italy insists on occupying a superior position, but those in charge are optimistic about the general situation of the current negotiations. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>Consolidation of International Position</p>
<p>(London) Diplomatic circles believe that the peace talks among Britain, France, and Italy have greatly consolidated the position of the League of Nations and have eliminated obstacles to cooperation between Britain and France in Geneva. Rumors say that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has expressed the minimum conditions for peace to British and French representatives. (National Telegraph, 19th)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Baldwin's Speech: Britain Voluntarily Promotes Peace <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(London) British Prime Minister Baldwin said in a speech in Worcester this afternoon that Britain has not taken separate action in the conflict between the League of Nations and Italy, and will not do so in the future. The League of Nations and the Kellogg-Briand Pact have failed to eliminate war, and Britain has to bear the responsibility of finding ways to end the war and restore peace, but Britain has not taken separate action in this regard. War is the most unwanted thing in the minds of the British government. The British government is always prepared to use any opportunity as a member of the League of Nations to seek peace. Some say that Britain's actions are aimed at overthrowing the Italian fascist system, which is the most harmful slander. The Prime Minister finally made an important statement about himself, saying, "I hope in my heart that I will never compete in the general election again, but I will wait and see about not competing in the election in the future. The general election after this one may be some time away. I only decided yesterday that the general election should not be delayed any longer and must be held as soon as possible."

<h3 id="e3">Italian Policy: Diplomacy and Military Advance Together, Resisting League of Nations Sanctions While Continuing to Deploy Troops to East Africa <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Rome) According to a telegram from this agency's interviewer, after the activities of the British, French, and Italian governments in diplomacy in recent days, important figures in the political circles here believe that Italy's views on the Abyssinian war and the League of Nations' sanctions have not been swayed. The things that should be paid attention to now are three items: (1) Since British Ambassador Sir Eric Drummond met with Prime Minister Mussolini, Britain will certainly not take separate action against Italy, but collective intervention is still possible. Regarding the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, Britain can still intervene in accordance with the wishes of the League of Nations, and Italy is afraid that it will urge the League of Nations to issue an intervention order, so it should continue to send troops to East Africa and prepare to resist the League of Nations' sanctions. (2) Since the League of Nations has forced its member states to boycott Italian goods, it still allows these countries to continue to import goods into Italy, except for those used in war. In this regard, Italy can only take retaliatory measures against countries that implement sanctions, that is, prohibit the import of goods from these countries into Italy. (3) Italy is still willing to clarify its relationship with the League of Nations. Regarding this, Italy's chief representative to the League of Nations, Mr. Aloisi, issued a statement saying that Italy's actions against Abyssinia are in line with the principles contained in the League of Nations Covenant, and it is very possible to prove it. Seeing that the people of the Abyssinian province of Tigray welcome the Italian army, abolish the slave system, and correct the anarchic state of the border provinces of Abyssinia, we know that the actions of the Italian government are fully justified. In other words, (A) Italy is not an aggressor but a liberator, (B) Abyssinia's promotion of the slave system should not be on an equal footing with civilized countries, (C) Abyssinia's so-called unity is artificial. Officials also believe that if the League of Nations reconsiders the Italo-Abyssinian dispute based on the actual situation, then the relationship between Italy and the League of Nations will not be difficult to clarify.

<h3 id="e4">Leader of Italian Veterans Visits London: Task to Probe Public Opinion and Eliminate Misunderstandings, Denying Formal Mission <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(London) General Garibaldi, leader of Italian veterans and friend of Prime Minister Mussolini (grandson of the Italian founding hero), recently arrived here from Rome. It is rumored that Garibaldi's trip is to try to collect British public opinion so that he can have a basis for resolving the Italo-Abyssinian dispute in the future. Officials have denied this, and Garibaldi himself also made a statement to the Sunday Chronicle to defend himself, saying, "I have not been entrusted with a formal mission here, but my mother is British, and I also believe in the English Orthodox Church. I may be able to clarify the misunderstandings of Italy by Britain in recent weeks. Italy is not preparing for war, nor does it want to engage in war, nor has it ever sought war before, but one thing that can make Italians feel unhappy is that Britain is taking separate action. Our Prime Minister Mussolini has guaranteed that British interests are sacred and will never be violated. I don't know why the British government requires France to provide assistance in the Mediterranean. Regarding the Abyssinian issue, Italy is prepared to discuss it fully within or outside the League of Nations. What we hope from other countries is to be open and honest and not to act rashly before understanding Italy's views." (Havas, 20th)</p>

<h3 id="e6">League of Nations Sanctions Committee Decides: Steps to Universally Boycott Italian Goods, Maintaining Justice with Willingness to Sacrifice, Calling on Non-Member States to Participate in Cooperation, Austro-Hungarian Representatives Opposed and Criticized <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The 52-member Sanctions Coordination Committee held a plenary meeting yesterday and made an important resolution to universally boycott Italian goods in an atmosphere of quiet discussion. The steps taken are as follows: (1) Adopted the British representative Anthony Eden's proposal to boycott Italian exports. (2) Unanimously supported the proposal regarding the organization of a mutual assistance committee. (3) Passed a proposal to prohibit the import of certain items into Italy. The list of prohibited items was passed on the spot. Austria and Hungary abstained from voting on the first proposal, and in addition to Austria and Hungary, Albania was also unwilling to vote on the third proposal. The representatives of Austria and Hungary all reiterated their reasons for opposing the sanctions and not voting, which were based on economic damage, but the broad resolution of the 52-member committee, despite the opposition of Austria and Hungary, can greatly represent international solidarity. Its most important characteristic is the willingness and spirit of self-sacrifice. Small countries also have this willingness and, with this spirit, are prepared to accept the losses caused by the sanctions. This resolution will have a disturbing effect on Italy. Although the actual impact of the sanctions cannot be predicted now, the spiritual impact is definitely not small. Soviet representative Litvinov made an important statement, saying that Soviet trade with Italy is in a surplus, but he is prepared to suffer losses to fulfill his obligations, but other countries must also abide by this obligation. If exceptional actions invalidate the sanctions, the Soviet Union will have to reconsider its overall position and make new decisions. The issue of non-member states participating in sanctions against Italy was also discussed by the committee in a closed-door meeting. The chairman stated that the most important issue that has always been on his mind but has not been resolved is the status of non-member states. He asked non-member states to maintain the dignity of the law over force with moral concepts and to prevent aggression in international life. Although they are not member states, they are signatories to the Paris Peace Pact. The League of Nations should inform all non-member states of its actions and proposals for handling the Italo-Abyssinian dispute and ask them to express their opinions. He believes that now is the time. To what extent can our suggestions serve a common purpose, and how should non-member states take the same actions as us to cooperate? These questions, we can only let each non-member state decide according to its conscience. At the afternoon meeting of the Sanctions Coordination Committee, the attitude of Austria and Hungary was widely criticized. Romanian representative Titulescu spoke passionately, saying that the imports of these two countries should be banned as a warning to those who do not comply with the sanctions. Then he talked about the most-favored-nation treatment clause, and the debate was very fierce, but it was later decided not to mention non-member states in its resolution. The Mutual Assistance Committee met yesterday, and one notable feature of its report was that it decided not to allow Austria and Hungary to increase their imports, and they should be held responsible, that is, in terms of exports, they should also suffer the same degree of loss as the countries participating in the sanctions. The next meeting of the Sanctions Coordination Committee will be held on October 31, when the date for the implementation of the sanctions will be decided. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<h3 id="e7">Full Text of Mutual Assistance Plan: Compensating Losses Incurred by Sanctions, Resolution Passed by the Coordination Committee <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Sanctions Plan Coordination Committee recently passed a resolution to adopt mutual assistance measures in accordance with Article 16, paragraph 3 of the Covenant. The full text is as follows: The governments of the member states of the League of Nations should, under the existing obligations, consider various measures:</p>
<p>(1) To increase the number of seaports in each country by various appropriate means, so that countries participating in sanctions that have lost the markets of member states can benefit. (2) If certain member states do not participate in sanctions and benefit from the implementation of sanctions by other member states, each member state should compare the mutual assistance obligations that these countries should bear with the benefits they have obtained, and take appropriate measures within a reasonable range to reduce the number of imported goods in these countries in order to offset them. (3) Countries participating in sanctions should try to encourage companies that usually specialize in exporting certain goods to Italy to increase their mutual trade with companies that usually specialize in importing such goods due to losses caused by sanctions. (4) Countries participating in sanctions should jointly organize a trade system to offset the loss of the Italian market due to participation in sanctions. (5) If the measures taken in trade cannot have a considerable effect on mutual assistance, then the countries participating in sanctions should consider the possibility of taking financial measures.</p>
<p>The Coordination Committee then passed a suggestion put forward by Romanian representative Titulescu and decided to implement special sanction measures against member states who refuse to participate in sanctions against Italy, namely Austria and Hungary. Titulescu's proposal was supported by Britain, Russia, the Little Entente, and the Balkan Entente. Mr. Conducis (Spain) of the Economic Mutual Assistance Committee once issued a statement, "The measures taken by the League of Nations to protect international law, each non-member state has the power to facilitate or reduce its effectiveness." This statement was aimed at Japan, the United States, Brazil, and Germany, four non-member states. Conducis suggested that since these countries are signatories to the Non-Aggression Pact, the League of Nations may send a copy of the results of its work and the text of various resolutions to the governments of these countries. If these countries believe that it is necessary to raise opinions on the sanctions issue, please notify him. This suggestion was passed by the Coordination Committee. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>Eighteen-Nation Group Postpones Meeting</p>
<p>(Geneva) The eighteen-nation small-scale committee announced the postponement of the meeting until after October 21. Spokespersons for the British and Russian delegations both said to this agency's interviewer, "The cooperation between Britain and France is closely related to European peace." The spokesperson for the British delegation also expressed the hope that the cooperation between Britain and France can make the League of Nations Covenant a complete victory. "Conversely, if Britain and France cannot cooperate, then Britain does not intend to take separate action, and it is better to stay out of it. The impact of this is probably beyond what can be expected." (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>Italy Expresses No Fear</p>
<p>(Rome) A semi-official Italian newspaper said that Italy is quite capable of resisting economic sanctions. "In 1934, Italy purchased more than 30% of its total imports from Japan, Brazil, the United States, and Germany. The goods purchased from Austria and Hungary accounted for 3.7% of the total imports. Japan, Brazil, the United States, and Germany are not member states of the League of Nations. Once economic sanctions are implemented, the goods they supply to Italy will inevitably increase. Among them, Germany accounts for about 40% of the coal needed by Italy, and Britain accounts for 39%." The newspaper also said that in 1934, Italy imported industrial products worth 1,541,000,000 lire. It is now planned to stop purchasing them and replace them with domestic products. Italy is actively researching new manufacturing methods. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>Italy's Bank Reserves Decrease</p>
<p>(Rome) From the 30th of last month to the 10th of this month, the gold reserves of the National Bank of Italy decreased by 226,000,000 lire to 4,025,354,000 lire. Foreign currency reserves increased from 392,533,000 lire to 412,644,000 lire. The amount of paper money in circulation increased from 15,271,716,000 lire to 15,425,510,000 lire. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>US Attitude to Be Considered</p>
<p>(Washington) According to State Department officials today, after the League of Nations' document requesting non-member states to universally boycott Italian goods is delivered, the US government will consider its attitude towards this move. However, the officials believe that the United States currently has no laws to prohibit the import of Italian goods. According to the Neutrality Act, any trade restriction must be applied to both belligerent countries, but Abyssinia's trade with the United States is minimal. This regulation is enough to have a significant impact on Italy. (Reuters, 20th)</p>

<p>(Berlin) The Abyssinian Emperor said to an interviewer from the Nazi Party's organ newspaper, the People's Observer, yesterday, "A fair and honorable peace treaty is indeed what we desire, but as long as a part of Abyssinian land is occupied by Italian troops, we will not conduct negotiations with Italy. Although we cherish peace, in the current situation, there is no possibility of proposing peace talks. The entire issue is now in the hands of the League of Nations, and only the League of Nations has the right to seek a solution. We have previously considered reducing the border line and exchanging land in accordance with the spirit of reciprocity, but if we cannot obtain compensation and abandon the land, then we have never considered it. This method will only make the two countries the only victims and is definitely not acceptable to us." (Havas, 19th)</p>

<p>Abyssinian Capital: According to official announcements, the Abyssinian army is still completing its military plans, which are sufficient to resist the Italian army's attack. At present, the Italian army's progress has been curbed by the Abyssinian outpost line. The Abyssinian army is in a strategically favorable position. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Abyssinian army is now moving in the Italian Somaliland border area, and its intention seems to be to prevent the Italian army there from contacting the Eritrean army. People here are paying close attention to this matter, because General Graziani (commander of Italian Somaliland) has established a strong base in Gelogubi in southern Abyssinia, from which he plans to launch a full-scale attack on Jijiga (east of Harar) to form a unified front with the Italian army in Eritrea. According to the results of Italian military aircraft inspections of the Abyssinian front line and the descriptions of prisoners, the Abyssinian army is concentrating in Geroe, which is located on the Fafan River and is the hub of the four major north-south and east-west thoroughfares. In terms of water conservancy and military strategy, it is the most important location in southern Ogaden province. The army led by Abyssinian General Nasibu is advancing from the north along the Fafan River towards Geroe. The required military supplies are transported from the Abyssinian capital to Harar province by truck, and then transported by donkeys. In addition, the official and unofficial army led by Chief Desdu of the Sidamo and Borana provinces will also head to Geroe to support General Nasibu. General Desdu is the king's son-in-law and claims to be able to summon 120,000 people to fight a desperate battle with the Italian army. He also has Belgian instructors to assist the army. In addition, the Sidamo and Borana provinces are located at the southern end of Abyssinia and are connected to Italian Somaliland and British Fania. Recently, a public road has been built to Kenya, so a large number of military supplies may have been received. (Havas, 19th)</p>

<p>(Paris) Army General Franchet d'Esperey, who served as the commander-in-chief of the Allied forces in Eastern Europe during the European War, had years of experience fighting in the mountainous and marshy areas of the Balkan Peninsula and the Vardar River (in Serbia), and finally defeated the allied forces of Bulgaria, Austria, and Hungary. Therefore, he has rich experience in wars in mountainous and marshy areas. He recently gave a speech at a banquet of the National Professional Groups Association, discussing Abyssinian military affairs, saying that he does not take sides with the belligerent countries, but from a military point of view, the Italian army will be able to achieve victory after taking large-scale military actions. He then recalled the defeat of the Italian army in the Battle of Adwa in 1896, saying that since occupying the city on the 5th of this month, the shame of defeat has been washed away. In addition, the Abyssinian regime has not been concentrated in the central government, and the weapons used by the country are old-fashioned. Generally, people do not know how to use modern automatic military equipment that determines victory in war. Abyssinian soldiers are also not very well educated, but Abyssinian soldiers are familiar with geography, and they know every hill and creek. Their actions can make armies with modern weapons feel dangerous. In addition, life is simple, and food and transportation are not a problem, so actions are more agile. Moreover, they are accustomed to the hot climate and life on the plateau and are most able to endure hardship. All of these are the strengths of the Abyssinian army. After the general finished his speech, the professional groups association discussed the current situation as usual. The issue discussed on this day was the Italo-Abyssinian war. (Havas, 20th)</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e11">Welcome Mr. Dern, U.S. Secretary of War <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— Star</p>
<p>The United States government recognizes the official establishment of the Philippine Commonwealth Government on November 15th, marking a new era in Far Eastern relations. Both the Congressional and Presidential branches have dispatched their top leaders to participate in person in Manila. Secretary of War Dern arrived in Shanghai today and will travel to Nanjing tomorrow to meet with leaders of our government. Following Mr. Dern's arrival in the East are former Chief of Staff General MacArthur, Vice President and Senate President Garner, the Speaker of the House, and several leaders of the Congressional Democratic Party. Before arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Dern spent several days in Japan, where he engaged in numerous exchanges with government leaders and prominent figures from all walks of life. At a time when relations between China, Japan, the England, and the United States are undergoing new developments, and when various Far Eastern issues urgently need a comprehensive solution, the Secretary of War, who bears the heavy responsibility of U.S. national defense and manages the Philippine Islands, has personally crossed the ocean to the East to exchange views. This will undoubtedly make an important contribution to this difficult situation. Taking this opportunity to witness the achievements of China's new construction and understand the aspirations of the Chinese people will further benefit the friendship between the traditionally friendly China and the United States. This is why we extend our sincere welcome to Mr. Dern. In terms of Mr. Dern's duties, he should have a deep understanding and make active efforts regarding Far Eastern issues. Although the U.S. Secretary of War is a civilian, he is legally responsible for the full implementation of the National Defense Act of 1920 and has the authority to manage the internal affairs of the Philippine Islands and Puerto Rico. The duties of the U.S. War Department are extremely diverse, ranging from military education, war plans, coastal defense, air defense, military law and supplies, to hydraulic engineering and the administration of the Panama Canal Zone, all of which are under the jurisdiction of the War Department. Although various duties are separately handled by the Chief of Staff, Chief Engineer, territorial governors, etc., the Secretary of War is responsible for overseeing the overall picture and supervising its implementation. The Philippine Islands are known to be the weakest link in the U.S. national defense chain. After autonomy, within ten years, the United States has lost most of its power to interfere in its internal affairs, but still bears full responsibility for its defense. This is because the U.S. flag has not been lowered, and U.S. naval ports still exist in Manila. If unfortunate events occur in the Philippines, whether internally or externally, it will involve the entire U.S. defense plan. Those in charge of military affairs must not only consider preventing enemy invasion but also prevent the occurrence of war before it happens. How to prevent the Philippines from becoming a powder keg in East Asia and how to make East Asian peace slightly more stable is what those who hold the reins of power should pay attention to. We believe that Mr. Dern's inspection and discussions will definitely make a contribution.</p>
<p>Secondly, in terms of Mr. Dern's life experience, he should have a deep understanding and make active contributions to China's silver problem. He was born 63 years ago and studied at the University of Nebraska in the West. At the young age of 23, he engaged in mining. For 20 years, he served as the manager of gold mines in Utah. In 1915, he entered politics and served as the governor of that state for eight years. Utah is the central region of silver mines. Silver senators in Congress, such as Mr. King and Mr. Thomas, all came from this state. Silver faction senators only know that increasing the price of silver can bring temporary benefits to silver mine capitalists and the people in silver mine regions, but they often ignore the poison that silver purchase policies have planted overseas. Mr. Dern has a full understanding of the wishes of the people in the silver mining region. He can take advantage of this trip to get an accurate impression and understanding of the resentment of the Chinese people towards the U.S. silver policy. The silver policy has shaken China's economic order and caused regrettable phenomena in Sino-U.S. relations. Mr. Dern is one of President Roosevelt's most trusted people and one of the most powerful leaders of the Democratic Party. He should know to make suggestions to harmonize U.S. foreign policy, economic policy, national defense plan, and foreign trade plan.</p>
<p>The current situation in the Far East is quite severe. The United States either advances or retreats, with no possibility of hesitation. After the outbreak of the war between Italy and Ethiopia, alarming events have occurred in the Shantou and Hankou areas. Judging from the U.S. warships sailing to Swatow, it is impossible for the United States to completely avoid being involved if something happens in the Far East. Preventing major disasters before they happen is the commendable quality of a statesman. We dare to express this wish on the day we welcome Mr. Dern's visit to China. We wonder what this wise guest thinks.</p>

<p>Suez: The Italian troops in East Africa are experiencing a severe water shortage. The many wells dug inland and in the mountains contain salty water, unsuitable for drinking and only usable for washing. All troop carriers are now carrying as much water as possible to alleviate this shortage. Food for the soldiers is also a serious problem. Abyssinian soldiers do not suffer from the lack of water because they all have fruits and vegetables in their bags, which they can eat to quench their thirst for a long time without drinking water. Italian soldiers are falling ill repeatedly, suffering from fever, joint pain, pneumonia, kidney disease, and dysentery. Two Italian ships are now dedicated to making ice in Massawa for the sick. Sappers with rifles are working behind the lines, as hard as the soldiers on the front lines. Many of them have petitioned General Tabloni, the Commander-in-Chief, to allow them to go to the front to fight instead of building roads. The Commander-in-Chief consoled them, saying that building roads is also a path to glory. The gasoline stored in Eritrea is limited and is being used up quickly. The Italian army is finding it difficult to replenish its supply because the Suez refineries refuse to extend credit. The Italian army is now buying as many trucks as possible in Suez, even old ones, and shipping them to Massawa. (North-China Daily News, 19th special dispatch)</p>

However, these methods of the Japanese diplomat did not have the slightest effect on the Mongolian representatives. They remained calm and did not change their original intentions because of these rash threats. Seeing that his efforts were unsuccessful, Ganji then claimed that he had been ordered by the government to notify the Mongolian delegation that if they did not accept the Japanese-Manchurian suggestions, then the Japanese-Manchurian delegations "would go to the capital of the Mongolian Republic, Kulun, with their troops to forcefully resolve this issue." This method of negotiation is unprecedented in national defense talks. All circles in Kulun are extremely indignant about this and sincerely hope that the Japanese government can restore its rash and disruptive "diplomatic personnel" to normalcy.

<p>— Chronicle</p>
<p>New Atmosphere in Sichuan</p>
<p>Starting upstream from Yichang, it takes four days to reach Chongqing by boat. Passing through the Three Gorges, the scenery on both banks is majestic and beautiful, with steep cliffs and rapid streams. The rivers and mountains are like a painting, and one's heart feels refreshed, instantly filled with boundless vitality. At four o'clock in the afternoon on the 29th, we passed Tieguang Cliff. After Tieguang Cliff is Que Shi Town, located on the right bank of the river, belonging to Sichuan Province, and is the border between Hubei and Sichuan provinces. Not far past Beishi, there is a bridge called "Wu Duo," which is quite humorous, presumably meaning that everyone should not grab territory. According to a friend on the same boat, this area was Yang Sen's defense zone in the early years of the Republic of China. This bridge was built during Yang Sen's troops' garrison. The traces of the defense zone system era still remain. After entering Sichuan Province, the soil gradually becomes fertile, appearing deep brown. The mountains are covered with crops or forests. Farmers work in the rain, and the fields are neatly arranged, showing the diligence of the people of Sichuan. Along the riverbanks, there are many碉楼 (fortified watchtowers), one built every few tens of feet. Most are built of mud, and some are still under construction. Nearby the watchtowers, it is said that a small number of troops are stationed. In case of bandits, the watchtowers communicate with each other to prevent bandits from entering. The Sichuan authorities are taking great pains to prevent bandits. I heard that the eastern part of Sichuan has also frequently reported unrest recently. When the reporter stayed overnight in Wanxian, I originally wanted to go ashore for a tour, but after learning that transportation was inconvenient after nine o'clock at night, and remote places had already declared martial law, I had to give up disappointedly. Having nothing to do on the boat, I leaned on the railing alone, looking at the lights of thousands of homes in the city, the night scene was magnificent, rarely seen elsewhere. At five o'clock in the afternoon on the 2nd of this month, the ship arrived in Chongqing and docked at the Jialing Wharf. The order was extremely chaotic. After landing, it was necessary to pass through an inspection station. On each street, pedestrians were like weaving, and vehicles were driving. Occasionally, there were those who did not obey traffic rules. The defects of Chongqing city lie in the lack of effort in order and cleanliness. After entering the city, I stayed at the YMCA and visited various places the next day to inquire about various situations. I learned that since the staff团 (military advisory group) entered Sichuan, the atmosphere in Chongqing has been renewed. Furthermore, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek personally came to supervise the suppression of bandits, encouraging the responsible leaders of Sichuan Province to be vigorous and self-reliant, to be loyal to their duties, and specifically proposed the five characters "公 (public)," "诚 (sincere)," "樸 (simple)," "拙 (honest)," "严 (strict)," ordering all levels of party, military, and government authorities in Sichuan Province, as well as all sectors of society, to abide by them, as the basis for revitalizing the spirit and changing the atmosphere. His prestige spread, and all the leaders of the Sichuan army obeyed orders respectfully, washing away the past decadent atmosphere. The reporter once talked with one or two people who have lived in Sichuan for a long time. They deeply lamented the various aspects of Sichuan in the past, with a feeling that there was a twenty-four history and not knowing where to begin. According to a certain gentleman from the academic circle who has lived in Sichuan for many years, in the past twenty-three years in Sichuan, there have been more than 470 large and small internal wars. The exorbitant taxes under the defense zone system are really unspeakable. For example, the military salaries and provisions in a certain military district were levied once a month. Various armies levied taxes under various names, and there were more than 700 customs checkpoints throughout the province. Some of the pre-collected money and grain had already reached the 69th year of the Republic of China. Several years ago, a certain army cleverly set up a name and levied a manure tax, arousing the public anger of the local people, who rose up in opposition. Although the result was not realized, it had already caused the people of Sichuan to lament, "Never in ancient times has manure been taxed, and now only farts are left without taxes." Also, a certain magistrate of Luxian County increased his income by specifically collecting lazy taxes from farmers who did not grow opium, from the countryside to the city, even from people without land who could grow opium. The people were resentful, so when he stepped down, they presented him with the couplet, "Leave one day earlier, Heaven has eyes, stay here for a long time, the earth has no skin," showing the tyranny of the government. After Chairman Chiang Kai-shek entered Sichuan, in addition to deploying the front-line bandit suppression military affairs, he also paid great attention to reforming Sichuan's politics. The 別動隊 (special action teams) led by the chairman's headquarters patrolled various places, observed the people's conditions, and many local tyrants and evil gentry were exposed. The most well-known special action team executed Shen Wenying, a major morphine manufacturer, in Chongqing, which was applauded by the people of Sichuan. Shen was a well-known Sichuan local leader who had run rampant in northern Sichuan for many years. In the past, he had been arrested by the Sichuan authorities several times, but was always released. This time, the special action team disguised themselves as detectives and learned all the details, destroyed his morphine manufacturing den, and executed him. Therefore, when the people of Chongqing talked about this matter, they mostly praised the efforts of the special action team. It is heard that many other bad elements have also been arrested one after another, and the trend of corruption has been slightly curbed. If it can be further thoroughly cleaned up, it will have a greater effect on reforming Sichuan's politics. The breaking of the defense zone system is also one of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's political achievements after entering Sichuan. Sichuan had formed a strict defense zone system since the "Jingchuan Campaign" in the ninth year of the Republic of China. Not only could the central government not intervene, but even the military commander could not manage the division commander's defense zone, and the division commander could not restrain the brigade commander's defense zone. In this way, the entire province was divided into many small defense zones under the large defense zone. The soldiers controlled everything in their jurisdiction, colluding with local evil gentry, and levying exorbitant taxes. The people of Sichuan could not bear their suffering and fled their homes. Therefore, when Xu Xiangqian led several thousand hungry and exhausted people, he was able to run rampant in northern Sichuan for a time. The spread of banditry was mainly due to this reason. When people in Sichuan talked about bandits, they often said, "In the past, the bandits in Sichuan were welcomed in by the poor people of Sichuan." Although the words are plain, they contain profound meaning. Therefore, if the defense zone system is not broken, military affairs cannot be advanced, and politics cannot be reformed. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's plan to reorganize Sichuan Province started with breaking the defense zone system. On the one hand, he carried out the reorganization and reduction of the Sichuan army, and on the other hand, he tried his best to break the decades-old idea of Sichuan people governing Sichuan. So far, the defense zone system can be said to have been completely broken. The Sichuan army is transferred, only listening to the orders of the central government. The reduction of the army has also been largely completed. The original Sichuan army had about 300 regiments, about 500,000 people. Now it has been reduced to 200 regiments, about 250,000 people. Military pay has been reduced to 40 million yuan, accounting for about two-thirds of the province's financial expenditure. Sichuan's politics has also made some progress compared to the past. According to those familiar with Sichuan's political situation, before the staff团 (military advisory group) entered Sichuan, most of the agencies below the provincial government did not work on time. Recently, they have strictly adhered to office hours, and most civil servants are energetic, willing to work hard and diligently. The recent change of the heads of the departments of civil affairs, construction, and education is deeply satisfying to the people of Sichuan, who believe that this is the initial step in reforming Sichuan's politics, enabling it to move towards construction.</p>
<p>Sichuan's finance has always been chaotic. Almost all banks issue banknotes, and the types of banknotes are also numerous, divided into savings certificates, exchange certificates, gift certificates, etc. The main business of the banks is not to engage in lending and savings, but to specialize in running remittance speculation, in order to make profits. Last year, Meifeng Bank made a profit of 600,000 yuan from running remittance, and used more than 300,000 yuan to build the Meifeng Building, a magnificent building, adding a lot of color to Chongqing's financial circles. However, on the other hand, many banks, such as commercial local banks, etc., suffered heavy losses due to the failure of running remittance. It is heard that the recently occurring issue of recalling local bank banknotes is actually related to the Xun remittance speculation issue. Because the reserve funds of local banks are only 6 million yuan, while the amount of banknotes issued is as high as 10 million yuan. In this case, it is naturally difficult to redeem them. In order to stabilize Sichuan's finance, the central government is doing its best to concentrate the right of issuance, and is recalling local banknotes at an 80% discount. Now the Central Bank has set up eleven exchange offices in various parts of Sichuan, limiting the people to exchange local banknotes for central banknotes at an 80% discount before November. However, most of these local banknotes are in the hands of the lower and middle classes of the southern border, and only this class suffers losses. If they are wealthy merchants, their deposits have already been deposited in banks, and they can not be affected.</p>
<p>With the deep-rooted problems of Sichuan Province, it is natural to have many difficulties in fundamentally reforming it in a short period of time. For example, in terms of finance, it still shows a situation of exhausting all resources. Monthly income and expenditure are insufficient by more than 2 million yuan. As of recently, the central bank has advanced funds amounting to 10 million yuan, borrowed 3 million yuan from the Central Bank, and borrowed 1 million yuan from the Farmers Bank. Therefore, the Sichuan Provincial Government has specially organized a financial reorganization committee, the purpose of which is to make finance public, reorganize finance, and reorganize provincial taxes. How will it be effective later? It remains to be seen. However, judging from the general situation, the future of Sichuan is generally optimistic. The people of Sichuan have been groaning for a long time, and they have great expectations for the central government. Every time the reporter talks with the people of Sichuan, between their words, they have enthusiastic expectations for the future of Sichuan, whether in military affairs, politics, industrial development, transportation construction, and education. Regarding education, such as Ren Hongjun's being the president of Sichuan University, and Hu Shuhua's being the president of Chongqing University, everyone is happy to have found the right person. Regarding transportation, the Sichuan-Guizhou Highway has been fully opened to traffic, and the Mianyang-Zitong section of the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway has recently been completed. It is heard that the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is also being planned and implemented. In the future, transportation will become more and more convenient, and industrial development will not be very difficult. Sichuan Province has very rich resources, with coal, iron, and oil production. The province has a population of 50 million and an area of more than 1.3 million square miles. The future development is limitless. The reporter has not been in Chongqing for long, but I feel that the morale of the people of Sichuan is more vigorous than that of the southeastern provinces. This is really a gratifying phenomenon.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Content of the Dalian Conference <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>With Tada's Proposition as the Main Topic: Resolved to Quickly Resolve the North China Issues</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Japanese military officers recently held a meeting in Dalian. Before its opening, Okamura, who conveyed the Japanese government's intentions, made a speech, roughly saying that it was purely to convey the Japanese government's new policy towards China at the four-minister meeting. In the future, Japanese diplomats and army and navy officers stationed in China must handle all negotiations in accordance with the new policy, in order to be unified. The important Japanese figures attending the meeting also discussed what they should do. The main topic was based on the booklet "Basic Concepts on China" published by Tada Hayao, commander of the Japanese army stationed in Tianjin, on the Emperor's Birthday. As a result, the following three items seem to have been decided: (1) Japan is not prepared to build anything in North China at present, but economic cooperation, especially the development of North China's assets, should be carried out effectively in the short term. This matter will be handled by the South Manchuria Railway Company. (2) Anti-Japanese actions in Central and South China should be corrected by rapid methods, so as not to hinder Sino-Japanese friendship. (3) The outstanding issues in North China should be negotiated and resolved quickly, targeting the national government. (19th)</p>
<h3 id="e69">Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu: Meeting on Closing Breaches and Restoring Dikes <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Agreed on the Distribution of Construction Funds, and Requested Central Government Subsidies</p>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: The meeting of the four provinces of Henan, Hebei, Shandong, and Jiangsu on closing breaches and restoring dikes was held at the Yellow River Conservancy Commission at 4:00 p.m. on the 15th. The attendees were Kong Xiangrong and Zhang Hanying from the commission, Xu Xinwu, Wang Junyu, Liu Bingzhong representing the Henan Flood Control Supervisory Office, Zhang Honglie and Zhang Lianjia representing Shandong, Qi Shou'an representing Hebei, Yu Shufang representing Jiangsu, and Song Tong representing Henan. Those present included Zhou Li, Li Shilin, Zhu Xinlian, An Lisen, Gu Hongxi, Cai Zhen, Lu Keming, Liu Binghuang, Luo Zhongmao, and Gan Bochen. After Chairman Kong Xianrong opened the meeting, Mr. Kong gave a speech first, and then the representatives of the four provinces of Henan, Hebei, Shandong, and Jiangsu reported successively, followed by discussion of various proposals. (1) The Henan Provincial Government proposed the project of repairing the Yellow River dikes (total construction fund of 898,159 yuan). (2) The Hebei Provincial Government proposed the outline of the Yellow River dike restoration project in Hebei Province (total construction fund of 375,000 yuan). (3) The Shandong Provincial Government proposed that the funds required for the dike restoration project in Shandong are very large, and it is really difficult for this province to allocate funds. Please give priority to subsidies from the central government's dike restoration project funds (total construction fund of 11,273,560 yuan). (4) The Shandong Provincial Government proposed to allocate funds to repair the Zhukou dangerous project (including construction fund of 162,600 yuan). (5) The Shandong Provincial Government proposed to allocate funds to repair the dikes on both sides of the Yellow River (including construction fund of 1,674,000 yuan). (6) The Jiangsu Provincial Government proposed the summary of the post-disaster project plan for closing breaches and restoring dikes in the flooded area of northern Jiangsu (total construction fund of 3,930,200 yuan). (7) The Shandong Provincial Government representative temporarily proposed that the third item of the Dongzhuang breach closure project plan in Shandong Province, the Zhudi section dike project (80,494.52 yuan), the seventh item, the restoration of people's dikes (46,875 yuan), and the ninth item, the post-disaster project (388,600 yuan, etc.) Although related to closing breaches, they have the nature of dike restoration, and it is proposed to allocate funds from the dike restoration project to handle them (total construction fund of 415,969.52 yuan). The above seven proposals were discussed together, and it was resolved that the total construction fund listed in the above proposals was 18,722,988.92 yuan, and the central government's proposed subsidy was 1 million yuan, which was only 5% and was naturally insufficient. It was necessary to allocate subsidies according to the number of workers, scope, and importance of the projects listed by each province. The resolutions are as follows: (1) Of the projects proposed by Henan Province, the first is to restore the protective revetment of the Shu Batou, (item 6 in the original proposal's appendix), the second is to build the new dike on Yangzhuang Beach (item 7 in the original proposal's appendix), and the second is the Wenxian Gouzhaizhuang Shunshui dam project (item 9 in the original proposal's appendix), totaling 147,003 yuan. Please subsidize half of the amount from the central government, which is 73,500 yuan, and the rest should be raised locally to start construction. (2) Of the projects proposed by Hebei Province, the remedy for river course migration (item B in the original proposal) totals 100,000 yuan. Please subsidize half of the amount from the central government, which is 50,000 yuan, and the rest should be raised locally to start construction. (3) Of the projects proposed by Shandong Province, the first is the Zhudi section dike project (item 3 in the Dongzhuang breach closure plan appendix), the second is the restoration of people's dikes project (item 7 in the Dongzhuang breach closure plan appendix), the third is the post-disaster project (item 9 in the Dongzhuang breach closure plan appendix), and the fourth is the repair of the Zhukou dangerous project (proposal 4), the above four items total 581,969 yuan. Please subsidize half of the amount from the central government, which is 291,000 yuan, and the rest should be raised locally to start construction. This is related to the Yellow River itself. Furthermore, the Shandong Provincial Government proposed to repair the dikes of the Yunhe, Zhuhe, Wanfu and other rivers, and the banks of Zhaoyang, Nanyang, Weishan and other lakes (proposal 3), totaling more than 11.2 million yuan. This is a restoration project outside the scope of the Yellow River flood. Please have the central government use the remaining 241,800 yuan of the 1 million yuan for this allocation, and hand it over to the local government to consider the urgency and select the key points for construction within the breach closure and dike restoration project. The above subsidies for Shandong total 532,800 yuan. (4) The breach closure part of the project proposed by Jiangsu Province also belongs to the scope of the flood (item 1 in the original proposal), with a total estimate of 687,500 yuan. This breach closure part is the most important part of the dike restoration project. Please subsidize half of the amount from the central government, which is 343,700 yuan, and the local government should raise equal construction funds to start construction. (Note) The above-mentioned half of the subsidized construction funds are all rounded to the nearest hundred yuan for the convenience of calculation. (8) The representatives of each province temporarily proposed that the projects listed in this proposal are all important. In addition to the parts that have been decided to be subsidized by the central government and those that will be undertaken by the local government for half of the cost, the remaining construction funds are severely insufficient. It is proposed to submit the case to the central government for approval. Resolution: The original proposals will be forwarded to the National Economic Commission for approval. The meeting adjourned at 8:00 p.m. Zhang Lianjia left Bian early on the morning of the 16th to plan for the breach closure. Zhang Honglie and others also returned to Lu and Su on the night of the 16th and the 17th respectively to report. (17th)</p>
<h3 id="e70">After the Collapse of Ge Dike, Retreating to Small Embankments to Defend <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Guofu Urges to Speed Up Preparations for Breach Closure —</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Zhencheng Ge Dike, after enduring for more than a hundred days, finally collapsed due to the fierce flow of the Yellow River. Fortunately, Qin Daoyu, the magistrate of Juancheng County, built a small embankment in July this year. Several thousand officials and people retreated to the embankment to defend it. According to Qin Daoyu's telegram to the provincial government, the departments of Civil Affairs and Construction, the breach closure working committee, the River Affairs Bureau, and the director's office of the experimental area, after retreating to the small embankment, the water flow was fierce, and the southern end of the embankment was breached. It has been stabilized after rescue. Zhang Yunjia, director of the River Affairs Bureau, has arrived at the construction site to guide the defense, and so on. Zhang Honglie, chairman of the breach closure working committee, telegraphed the National Economic Commission on the 18th, reporting on the purchase of materials. Bids were opened in October. The first phase requires 754,000 yuan. If the funds are not available, the materials will be difficult to supply, and the work that has already started will be suspended. Please remit the material funds due this month, and so on. The engineering plan and budget formulated by the breach closure working committee have been prepared, and Zhou Li, director of the engineering team, will bring them to Beijing within days to submit to the National Economic Commission for review. Also, Kong Xiangrong, acting director of the Yellow River Commission, telegraphed the breach closure committee, according to the telegram from Qin Fen, secretary-general of the National Economic Commission, that according to the telegram from Chen Guofu, chairman of Jiangsu, the breach closure must be done after the summer flood, and now there are only four or five months before the summer flood. Time is fleeting. Please prepare quickly for the breach closure as scheduled. The breach closure committee plans to reply immediately, mainly that the Li Shengcun embankment protection project has already started. The Jiangsu dam will be bid on the 20th. The remaining purchase and transportation of materials will be bid this month and is being actively carried out.</p>

<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Xiao Focheng, member of the Southwest Political Council, returned to China on the 13th of this month after taking a leave of absence to recuperate in Siam on the 5th of this month, accompanied by his son Songjian and others. He arrived in Hong Kong and immediately took a night boat back to the province. He arrived safely in Guangzhou on the morning of the 14th. Many people from the political and party departments of Guangzhou welcomed him at the dock. It is noted that Xiao is an important member of the Southwest Party and government, and his return to Guangdong is highly valued by the outside world. After arriving in Guangdong, Xiao expressed his views on international affairs and told reporters that there have been rumors in the country recently that Siam is anti-Chinese, but the reality is not as severe as the rumors. Siam's restrictions on overseas Chinese are purely to prevent Chinese workers from seizing their livelihoods and interests. As for the ban on overseas Chinese education, after the director of the Guangdong Education Department went to Siam to mediate, China and Siam gradually restored good feelings. The Siamese government also agreed to improve the regulations banning overseas Chinese education. The recent report on the economic cooperation between China, Japan, and Manchuria, which touched on the Siamese government's preparation to recognize the government of Manchuria, is to avoid the dissemination of false information. On that day, the Siamese government had announced on the broadcasting station, officially denying the recognition of the puppet Manchurian government. As for domestic issues, what concerns us most at present is the convocation of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee and the Fifth National Congress. The Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee will be held in Beijing on the 12th of next month. The Southwest Executive Department may submit proposals to the meeting in the future. The rumor that Mr. Hu Hanmin is about to return to China is premature. However, recently, the war in Italy and Asia broke out. For the sake of relocating and resting, Hu has arrived in Germany. The author recently received a handwritten letter from him from Germany, with an attached photo. According to him, he has no intention of returning to China recently. After wandering around Europe and the United States, he will decide his next course of action. Since returning to Guangdong, Xiao has been attending meetings of the Southwest Executive Department and the Southwest Political Affairs Council, and is quite busy. (October 16)</p>
<h3 id="e72">Additional Fee on Soybean Cakes Strictly Collected in Chaozhou and Shantou <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Changhao's Shop Assistant Detained for Refusing to Pay —</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The collection of an additional 2% fee on domestic soybean cakes in Zhongda has been strongly opposed by the associations of the northern and southern ports of Shantou, but has failed to obtain the official permission to cancel it, resulting in a suspended case. However, the Chaozhou and Meizhou collection offices have repeatedly urged merchants to pay. Yesterday, they sent a letter to the chairmen of the northern and southern port associations, instructing them to have all merchants sweepingly pay the previously registered fee for various types of soybean cakes. The letter stated that the additional fee on soybean cakes had been rejected by the Southwest Political Affairs Committee and could not be revoked. The Shanghai representative has also not come to the province. Do not believe the rumors. Principal Zou has sent an official letter to the municipal government proving it, and asking to force the recovery of overdue fees. Please quickly pay the funds, and so on. Also, the Shantou Municipal Government yesterday received an order from the Department of Finance, instructing that the municipal government order the Public Security Bureau to arrest people and force the recovery of the unpaid soybean cake tax from Zhao Changhao, a member of the northern and southern port associations. After receiving the order, the municipal government immediately ordered the Public Security Bureau to execute it. The shop assistant of Zhao Changhao was detained in the first branch. The chairman of the northern and southern port associations went to bail him out, and convened another meeting, deciding to send representatives to the donations bureau to negotiate a solution to the additional fee. Once a solution is reached, taxes will be paid.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Nanchang Chamber of Commerce Petitions for Emergency Curb on the Bankruptcy Trend <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Please Handle Strictly by the Provincial Government to Maintain the Market and Avoid Panic</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The trend of bankruptcy in the markets of Jiangxi Province has been emerging frequently recently. The provincial and municipal chambers of commerce had previously petitioned the provincial government and the Department of Finance for relief due to the bankruptcy of Fukunheng, Zhang Zhengshun, Wu Peiji, and the Huyuansing Six-Union Company. Unexpectedly, Yilongxin recently went bankrupt, so the remitting and exchange guild and the money industry guild were deeply afraid that the bankruptcy trend would open up and become unmanageable. Therefore, they held a joint meeting yesterday and decided to ask the executive committee of the municipal chamber of commerce to petition the provincial government and the Department of Finance. For bankruptcy stores, administrative agencies should deal with them severely. The municipal chamber of commerce has submitted a report to the provincial government, conveying the situation. The report stated, "According to a letter from the Nanchang remitting and exchange guild and the Nanchang money industry guild, we have seen that the bankruptcy trend has been very strong recently, and the market is shaking. In general, shops and households are afraid of making loans and deposits. At this time of financial exhaustion and tight credit, it is unfortunate that bankruptcy events have occurred one after another, such as Fukunheng, Zhang Zhengshun, Wupeiji Zhuang, Huyuanxing, and six households, which have been suspended for less than ten days. Debts are piling up, affecting the entire market. Now the bankruptcy of Yilongxin is also reported. If a method is not established to prohibit it, I am afraid that the bankruptcy trend will repeatedly occur and follow, and I do not know where it will end. It is investigated that bankruptcy cases have always been prosecuted in court, and often involve legal language, wasting time and delaying matters. By the time of execution, it is unknown how long it will take to conclude. The result is nothing more than bankruptcy. Those cunning debtors will also hide their property in advance and secretly hoard it. After the case is closed, they are still rich family members, while the creditors have suffered heavy losses. This is especially painful. If the law is not respected, people will not know the punishment. If the prevention is not strict, the malpractice cannot be stopped. Our associations have jointly discussed, all in order to maintain the market and curb the bankruptcy trend. For bankruptcy cases, the administrative agency should formulate a temporary regulation for severe measures. In the event of a bankruptcy case, creditors can apply to the administrative agency for strict handling, so as to avoid delaying time, and the debtors can be free from the law. If this is done with lightning speed, the bankruptcy trend can be reduced, and the market will not be greatly panicked. In addition to submitting to the Provincial Government Department of Finance, a corresponding letter is sent to your association, please investigate and hope to transfer it for review and implementation. Based on this, it is found that the market bankruptcy trend is emerging frequently, and if it is not quickly prohibited, it is not enough to maintain the market and reassure the people. The methods described in the letter from the guild, etc., are for temporary relief and cannot be said to be unreasonable. However, it is not easy to draft the regulations, and we should ask your government to first issue an emergency announcement to sternly warn the people. If there are bankruptcy incidents, we will first instruct the Public Security Bureau and the county government to strictly investigate and deal with them to supplement the judicial office's inadequacies. Hopefully, the bankruptcy trend can be stopped, and the market can be free from panic. There is no better way to save the day than this." (October 18)</p>
<h3 id="e74">Bandit News from the Fujian-Zhejiang Border <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Zhang and Su's Factions Already Defeated; Huang's Bandit Gang Also Scattered</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Jiang Dingwen, the Pacification Commissioner of Fujian, arrived in the province on the 12th from Zhangzhou. After welcoming Chairman Lin of the National Government, he immediately went to northern Fujian on the 14th for inspection. He arrived in Yanping on the 16th and met with Dai Minquan, commander of the 45th Division, and Tang Yintang, the administrative commissioner of the Second District, to inquire about the situation regarding the suppression of the Big Sword Society bandits. On the 17th, he traveled by car through Jianyang, met with Zhou Zhiqun, commander of the newly编11th Division, and then went to Jian'ou to meet with Liu Heding, commander of the 56th Division. Subsequently, he went to Pucheng to meet with Li Yutang, commander of the 3rd Division. It was reported that Wei Lihuang, the commander-in-chief of the suppression operations in the border areas of Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi, also arrived from Jiangshan on the 18th. Currently, Jiang considers his official duties completed and plans to return to the province from Pucheng on the 20th, arriving in Zhangzhou around the 25th. As for the recent bandit suppression situation on the Fujian-Zhejiang border, there was a communist bandit faction in southern Zhejiang led by Zhang Yunlong, Su Yu (also known as Liu Hannan), and Huang Fuwu. Currently, Zhang and Su's faction has been defeated, and the bandit leaders have been killed. Only Huang Fuwu remains, leading his remnants to flee into Shouning in eastern Fujian. Therefore, the military suppression of bandits in Zhejiang has come to a temporary conclusion. Huang's bandits, after fleeing into Shouning, immediately sought to connect with Xie Zuolin and Fan Tiemin in eastern Fujian, and Liu Yingyi and Huang Ligui in northern Fujian, attempting to secretly cross the Fujianese army's blockade line and continue using guerrilla tactics to plunder grain to sustain their remaining strength. Therefore, the military suppression of bandits on the Fujian border has been quite tense recently. Wei Lihuang has transferred a certain division's troops to connect with the eastern Fujian troops, forming a line to strictly seal off the area. According to a report from Shi Er, the magistrate of Fuan County, stationed in eastern Fujian, the first regiment of his unit is engaged in fierce fighting with Xie Zuolin's faction at the junction of Xiapu and Fuding, and the third regiment is engaged in fierce fighting with Fan Tiemin's faction at the junction of Shouning and Fuan. The security regiments are also mobilized to assist in the suppression, and the situation is expected to be resolved within a few days. Furthermore, according to a telegram from Commander Liu of Jian'ou County, stationed in northern Fujian, after Huang Ligui's faction fled into the border area between Jian'ou and Jianyang, Commander Liu immediately夹击the bandits with the troops of Commander Zhou Zhiqun's division. The bandits initially resisted stubbornly in the dangerous passes of Dongshan Cenyang and other areas, and then scattered into the mountains. Troops are being dispatched to search for them. Additionally, the Big Sword Society bandits in Yanping and Shaxian counties have all surrendered, handing over their talismans, swords, guns, and banners. Dai Minquan, the garrison division commander, and Tang Yintang, the commissioner, specially led troops to the bandit areas to appease and encourage them to start anew, in order to stabilize the situation.

<h3 id="e83">International Trade Bureau Releases This Year's Foreign Trade Situation: Trade Volume for the First Half of the Year Totals Over 800 Million Yuan; a Decrease of Approximately 4 Percent Compared to the Same Period in Previous Years <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>According to the New New News Agency, He Bingxian, Director of the International Trade Bureau, announced that foreign trade this year continues to decline, but without a significant decrease. In terms of the total trade volume, the first quarter amounted to 389,818,892 yuan. The third quarter saw a slight increase, amounting to 415,006,077 yuan. The total for the first half of the year was 808,824,968 yuan, a decrease of 4 percent compared to the same period in previous years. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Trade Situation in the First Six Months: Compared to the same period last year, foreign trade in the first six months of this year showed a better export performance in the first quarter, with each month exceeding the same period last year by 8 or 9 percent. February was equivalent to 97.34 percent. The second quarter saw a decline. Except for April, which exceeded the same month last year very slightly, May and June were only equivalent to 82-83 percent of the same month last year. On the import side, the situation was the opposite of exports. Each month in the first quarter was lower than the same month in previous years, while each month in the second quarter exceeded the same month in previous years. The highest, such as June, even exceeded by 6.11 percent, mainly due to the sharp increase in grain imports this year. In terms of the total amount, except for April, each month was lower than the same period last year. Regarding the issue of gold and silver imports and exports, which is related to the trade balance, in the first half of this year, due to the implementation of various government restrictions on silver exports and the inflow of foreign capital, silver exports not only decreased sharply by 92 percent compared to the same period last year, but silver imports also increased by 2.7 million yuan compared to the previous year. As for raw gold and gold coins, the import value was over 112,000 gold units, and the export value was over 13.969 million gold units, which also decreased compared to the same period last year.</p>
<p>Trade Values and Gold Conversion Changes: However, when observing the figures in gold conversion, the situation is quite different. Regardless of imports or exports, they are mostly higher than the same period last year. The US dollar value of exports was still the highest in January, at over 19.07 million gold dollars. February and March were the lowest, but still reached over 14 million gold dollars. Compared to the gold conversion value of exports in the same period last year, all months showed an increase. The US dollar value of imports was the highest in April and May, each amounting to over 39 million gold dollars. February was the lowest, but still reached over 24.09 million gold dollars. Compared to the same period last year, except for January and February, which decreased by 15 percent, the remaining months all showed an increase. June even increased by more than 30 percent. As for the total amount, the situation was roughly the same. The reason why the gold conversion figures this year exceeded the same period last year is mainly due to the rise in silver prices. The highest gold conversion rate for the national currency in the same period last year was 0.34290. This year, the silver price涨风was strong, and the exchange rate of the national currency against the US dollar increased from 24 cents in January to 40 cents in June. Therefore, in the first half of this year, the value of China's foreign trade, when calculated in银方商, showed a lower degree of export decline than import decline. Exports decreased by 2 percent, and imports decreased by 4 percent. However, when calculated in gold conversion, the degree of import increase was equal to exports, with exports increasing by 10 percent and imports increasing by 9.5 percent. The close relationship between the changes in silver prices and trade values can be seen from this.</p>
<p>Import Surplus Values in the First Half of This Year: The import surplus in the first half of this year totaled 286,085,622 yuan, a decrease of over 15,219,000 yuan compared to the same period last year. The reason why the import surplus figure was lower in the first half of this year was due to the decline in import trade in the first quarter of this year. The total import surplus in the first quarter of this year was over 118 million yuan, a decrease of no less than 40 million yuan compared to the same period last year. However, in the second quarter, due to the sharp increase in rice imports, the import surplus reached over 167 million yuan, an increase of over 25 million yuan compared to the same period last year. Otherwise, the import surplus in the first half of this year would have been even lower. If we observe the percentage of the import surplus in the total import amount for each month, the foreign trade balance in the first half of this year was not better than the same period last year. In the same period last year, the average monthly import surplus accounted for 52.87 percent of the total import amount. This year, it also accounted for 52.45 percent. The highest, such as March and April, even accounted for over 59.87 percent, which was unseen in the same period last year. Fortunately, exports were strong in January and February, so the import surplus only accounted for 37-38 percent of the total population value of that month. Otherwise, the percentage of the import surplus in the total population amount in the first half of this year would have been close to the peak of the first half of 1933 (61 percent).</p>

<p>According to the Japanese Japanese Daily News, Sir Leith-Ross, since arriving in Shanghai on the 21st of last month, has been督励supporting his entourage and collecting materials from all aspects, except for going to Nanjing and Hangzhou. It is now reliably learned that Ross received a government order a few days ago to return to his country, because the British government is consulting on the tense relations with Italy and economic sanctions against Italy in Europe. In addition, Ross recognized Japan's China policy when he passed through Japan and understood the rules of China after arriving in China. I am afraid that the purpose of their trip cannot be achieved, so there is no need to stay in China.</p>

<p>Silver and Money Industries Handle Accommodatingly: The long-term credit loans for the tenth-end period for industrial and commercial sectors are mostly from money houses, followed by banks. Since the silver and money industries received the order from the Ministry of Finance to accommodate as appropriate, various money houses and banks have settled interest and extended the period for 70% to 80% of the credit loans due to industrial and commercial sectors until the fourth-end. Yesterday was a bank holiday, and the money market rate was 12% per annum. It is expected that it will rise again soon due to the busy settlement of accounts.</p>

<h3 id="e98">The Chinese Industrial Chemical Research Institute Successfully Researches Spray Paint; Another Great Contribution in the Tide of Advocating Domestic Goods <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Industrial Chemical Research Institute on Pobo Road in this city has been established for six years. It is dedicated to developing domestic production and promoting new industries as its basic research purpose. Over the years, it has made many creations to the chemical industry. Recently, the preliminary test of lacquer has been completed. According to Dr. Pan Lujie, director of the institute, lacquer is an excellent product for decorating and protecting wooden and ironware, commonly known as spray paint. It is used on cars, high-end ironware, and woodenware. Its texture is strong, it dries quickly, it is very heat-resistant, and its luster is beautiful, which is incomparable to other paints or varnishes. Therefore, the number of Chinese people who love to use lacquer is increasing. It is heard that all the woodenware in the International Hotel in Shanghai uses lacquer instead of paint, which shows that the advantages of lacquer have been recognized by most people. However, it is a pity that this lacquer is all imported, and the outflow of rights and interests every year is very large. Although there has been a small amount of domestic lacquer in recent years, its basic raw materials still come from foreign countries, and most of the benefits ultimately go to the coffers of other countries. This time, the Chinese Industrial Chemical Research Institute used domestic cotton as a starting point, and after considerable treatment, made nitrocellulose. The nitric acid and other auxiliary drugs used in it are also all pure domestic products. The quality of the nitrocellulose obtained is not inferior to the best European and American goods, so-called "quarter-second nitrocellulose" (according to the inspection of nitrocellulose, it is best to drop a steel ball into the solution of nitrocellulose, and it is best to drop ten inches in a quarter of a second, followed by dropping ten inches in half a second, and so on). In addition, various synthetic gums used in lacquer are also in the program of the research institute. The so-called "organic salt glue" has also achieved satisfactory results. Its crystals are transparent and do not stain. It is most suitable for lacquer with bright colors. The "organic salt glue" is also made entirely from domestic raw materials. This research has been carried out for more than a year, and the staff has often forgotten to eat and sleep and worked day and night without the slightest slack. Their hope for the successful development of industry is like this. The Chinese Industrial Chemical Research Institute is an academic research institution founded by Mr. Wu Yun Chu and Tianchu MSG Factory. It is committed to public service. Whether it is a factory or an individual, it can take advantage of its exquisite equipment and extensive experience, and its complete library is an indispensable resource for chemical technology.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Ministry of Finance Instructs the Niter and Sulfur Bureau to Promote Domestic Niter, Sulfur, and Sulfuric Acid <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Various Industries Must Try Their Best to Use Domestic Products; Kaicheng Acid Manufacturing Company Has Abundant Production</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance instructed the Jiangsu Niter and Sulfur Bureau to promote domestic niter, sulfur, and sulfuric acid. The order said: Since the Ministry took over the niter and sulfur affairs, it has made unremitting efforts to revitalize domestic niter and sulfur products. For the niter part, the Kaiyue Niter Refining Factory has been purchasing raw niter to refine fine niter. This fine niter contains potassium nitrate, which is more than 99% of the ingredients, which is no less than imported products. Relying on supplying the needs of the whole country, the effect is gradually obvious. Recently, the Ministry will collect niter from various domestic niter-producing areas, such as Xuhai in Jiangsu, Caodan in Shandong, 21 counties in northern Anhui, and the entire province of Hebei, and hand over the niter collection affairs to the factory for processing, in order to increase raw materials and expand sales. For the sulfur part, the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Henan have the most abundant output. The Ministry has repeatedly ordered to improve quality and reduce costs, and ordered various provinces to use them as much as possible. Recently, an improved sulfur refining test farm was established in Xinan, Henan Province, using the latest scientific methods to actively improve manufacturing to facilitate sales. In addition, potassium chlorate has always been supplied by foreign countries, and no factory in China has set up its own factory to manufacture it. The Salt Administration of the Ministry has repeatedly established a potassium chlorate manufacturing research committee to study all matters related to the establishment and manufacture of potassium chlorate, and hired experienced industrialists in China to jointly study to ensure progress on record. All these efforts to revitalize domestic products are to stop loopholes and assist industry and commerce, and are also beneficial to the overall management of niter and sulfur and the increase of tax revenue. It is now found that sulfuric acid is also a kind of niter and sulfur products, and the number of domestic users is very large. In the past, because our country produced rare, mostly purchased from imports, the outflow of rights and interests is countless. Recently, domestic acid manufacturing plants, such as Shanghai Kaicheng Acid Manufacturing Company and Tianjin Lizhong Acid Manufacturing Factory, manufacture sulfuric acid with abundant production. For the sake of revitalizing the country, it should be promoted. It is hereby ordered that the bureau should immediately follow the instructions, and transfer the order to the factories and users in the province. In the future, when purchasing and transporting sulfuric acid, they must try their best to use domestic products. As for how to strictly audit the uses of sulfuric acid in various industries to emphasize management, and how to effectively promote the sales of domestic sulfuric acid to cultivate tax sources, you should also refer to the situation in the province, and prepare detailed measures and submit them for review and handling. This order.</p>

<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau, in order to vigorously implement the New Life Movement and rectify the city appearance, previously ordered all its subordinate bureaus and offices to conduct a citywide wall-cleaning campaign, removing all kinds of advertisements and rental notices from the city's houses and lane walls. Designated locations were specified for hanging advertisement boards or rental signs to maintain cleanliness and enhance aesthetics. The bureau continues to send personnel daily to inspect and offer guidance and corrections wherever errors are found. As a result, the walls along all roads are able to maintain permanent cleanliness. According to a spokesperson for the bureau, since the promotion of the New Life Movement, the rectification of the city appearance has been put on the right track. There are also considerable directives regarding residents hanging and drying clothes.</p>

<p>According to the Shanghai Nichinichi Shimbun, at 7 PM on the 19th, while the Japanese theater "Kabuki-za" on North Sichuan Road was showing the famous film "Railway," a violent explosion occurred suddenly at the feet of Yamamoto Sotaro, a third-class seaman from the warship Iwate, who was seated in the front row on the left side near the stage. Sparks flew everywhere. All the spectators in the venue, upon seeing this, were shocked and lost their color, and rushed to escape. The venue was in chaos for a time. Upon hearing the news, the Japanese Consulate Police Station immediately dispatched a large number of police chiefs and detectives, together with officers from the Dixwell Road Police Station, to rush to the theater to investigate. Fortunately, there were no injuries. However, a corner of the sailor's trousers was scorched by the fire. Furthermore, it was found that the explosive device was made by filling gunpowder into a glass bottle, with brown liquid left on the ground. It appeared to have been made with highly flammable materials such as sulfuric acid and gunpowder. However, there was no fuse. It was probably placed there beforehand, and exploded after a certain period of time.</p>
<h3 id="e112">French Concession, Large Number of Pickpockets Arrested, Theft Cases Expected to Decrease After Arrests, Specializing in Pickpocketing on Streetcars and in Theaters <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Lu Zhulin, Wang Zhihao, and other detectives from the French Police recently cracked a case involving Xu Decai, alias Xu Datou, a well-known pickpocket king in this port, and four accomplices, Wang Dehua, Yuan Hailin, and Hu Asheng, and transferred them to the Special Second Court for interrogation and detention. This was reported in the previous newspaper. After the case occurred, detectives Guo Shaorong and others continued to apprehend six pickpocket accomplices, Yuan Liansheng (20 years old, from Nanjing), Wu Shaoshan (23 years old, from Shanghai), Lu Jinsheng (24 years old, from Jiading), Li Amao (21 years old, from Jiangbei), Li Hailou (28 years old, from Tianjin), and Ji Jinsheng (also known as Amao, 24 years old, from Suzhou). These individuals specialized in using crowded gatherings outside streetcars, movie theaters, and shops as opportunities to practice their skills of stealthily pilfering. They were all led by the previously arrested Xu Datou. It is rumored that some police officers receive salaries from these individuals, which is why it is difficult to crack cases and bring them to justice. This time, the net of justice is vast and spares nothing, and they were caught off guard, which can be said to be the end of their days. The police transferred the above six defendants to the Special Second Court, where Judge Zhang Chaozuo conducted a preliminary hearing. Because the police investigation was not yet complete, a request for postponement was made. The court ordered that the hearing be rescheduled for the 25th, and the defendants were remanded in custody. With this large-scale arrest and punishment of pickpockets by the French police, it is expected that the trend of pickpocketing in the French Concession will subside and be quiet for a while.</p>

<p>Jiang Xuesen, from Zhenjiang, over forty years old, runs Taixing Cigarette and Paper Store at No. 101, MacGaoPaul Road, French Concession. At 0:10 AM on the 18th, three bandits suddenly broke open the back door and entered, rushing to the store hall. They threatened Jiang, attempting to rob him. Jiang shouted loudly, and the bandits panicked and did not dare to search and rob, and turned and fled out the back door. Jiang disregarded the danger and chased after them, capturing one of the bandits in the rear, and reported the capture to the police station. The captured bandit confessed his name as Liu Jianqing, 28 years old, from Henan, with no fixed address or occupation. He admitted that he and two other accomplices at large came to the plaintiff's store to rob. The police chief immediately dispatched Detective Li Wenqing to investigate and arrest the accomplices, but without success. He reported back to the police chief, and the next day, he transferred the case to the First Criminal Division of the Special Second Court, where Judge Xiong conducted a hearing. The police lawyer requested a postponement of the investigation to apprehend the accomplices at large and then request a trial. The court verified the report, questioned the defendant, and then approved the postponement for further investigation before another hearing. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Comprador's Outrageous Behavior, Impersonating a Public Official, Luring and Raping a Woman <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Tang Qirong, a 24-year-old native of Zhenjiang working as a comprador, residing at No. 107, Huanlong Road, French Concession, is known for his outrageous behavior. On the night of the 11th of this month, at 11 PM, he encountered Huang Yumei, a 20-year-old woman from Yangzhou (currently residing at No. 17, Maisai Erdi Luo Road), who used to be a prostitute selling salt water but has now reformed. Tang immediately stopped Huang, impersonating a police detective and demanding to see her prostitute's license. Huang replied that she had already stopped her prostitution business and was no longer a prostitute. Upon hearing this, Tang still falsely claimed that he wanted to take Huang to a certain place for further investigation. In the darkness, he took the woman to a bedroom, forcibly raped her, and stayed overnight. The next morning, Tang promised to give the woman six yuan, instructing her to follow him to a certain place to collect the money. At the time, the woman was unable to resist due to her weakness and let him do as he pleased. The next morning, hearing Tang's promise of money, she did not hold a grudge and believed him to be true, and followed him out to collect the money. It turned out that Tang was a cunning man, and he designed an escape midway. The woman was unable to pursue him, cried in vain, and returned home disgruntled. The day before, Huang Yumei happened to meet Tang on the road and demanded the promised money. To her surprise, Tang not only ignored her, but also punched her, causing her injury. Subsequently, the woman found out Tang's address and reported it to the French Police. Detectives Zhang Zhaolin and Cao Chuanbiao arrested Tang. After an investigation, the next day, he was transferred to the First Criminal Division of the Special Second Court. The police lawyer explained the case, accusing the defendant of impersonating a public official, intimidating and defrauding, disrupting public morals, and causing injury, and filed a public prosecution. Subsequently, the plaintiff Huang Yumei stated the details of how the defendant falsely claimed to be a detective to inspect her license, lured her into rape, and caused injury. When questioned, the defendant's confession was evasive and cunning. After Judge Li Changnian verified the confession, he declared the facts clear, announced the end of the debate, and awaited a scheduled pronouncement of the verdict. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>

<p>The Municipal Zoo on Wenmiao Road has recently added three new aquatic animals, all of which are valuable and have been put on display. A reporter from Datong News Agency investigated and reported the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Large Turtle: The zoo recently purchased a large turtle from a Cantonese man. It weighs 30 jin net, with a shell length of 22 inches and a width of 17 inches. When the head and tail are extended, the length reaches more than one foot. It is now kept in the same place as the fish in the aquatic category, which has aroused the interest of visitors.</p>
<p>Rare Tortoise: The zoo also purchased a rare tortoise. Although the shell is no different from ordinary tortoises, its tail has extremely obvious scales, and its head is in a special state. The mouth is sharp and resembles an eagle's beak. It can prey on fish and shellfish, and neither the head nor the tail can retract inwards. It is indeed rare, so it is specially named the "Eagle Scale Tortoise." Due to the increasingly cold weather, the tortoise urgently needs to hibernate in the mud layer, so the exhibition will have to wait.</p>
<p>Goldfish: Furthermore, Zheng Xiaoqiu, the director and actor of the Star Film Company, after the death of his father Zheng Zhengqiu, will move to live in the company. He intends to part with dozens of goldfish that he has raised for many years and donate them to the zoo. He has already sent someone to contact the zoo, and they will be sent to the zoo for display within the next few days, for people to enjoy.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Sixty-Odd Businesses Submit Petition to French Consul General, Requesting Reinstatement of Vegetable Stalls on Rue Conty <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The vegetable stalls along Rue Conty in the French Concession have been ordered to be shut down by the French Police for more than a month, and the matter has not been resolved. The stall vendors have been running around appealing and petitioning the Chinese Taxpayers' Association and others, requesting assistance for relief. Details have been reported in this newspaper many times. It is now reported that over sixty businesses on Rue Conty, including Jiuda Xin, Fuyuan Sauce Garden, Xinchangsheng, Li Runde, Shentaichang, and Hengchang Yiji, have a close relationship with the vegetable stalls, and have jointly submitted a petition to the French Consul General Baudens, requesting that the Municipal Council be ordered to allow the establishment of vegetable stalls at the east end of Rue Conty to maintain the market. The original petition is as follows:</p>
<p>"Petition for Request: We, the undersigned, hereby submit this petition. The vegetable stalls on Rue Conty have been closed down by the French Police for more than a month, and have not been reinstated. As a result, the livelihoods of the vegetable vendors are in a state of panic. Some are starving to death, some are deeply in debt, and some have exhausted their possessions. The situation is dire, beyond words. We, the undersigned, are all businesses operating on Rue Conty and have witnessed the situation closely. We believe that if the matter is not resolved, the danger to their lives will only increase. The vegetable stalls have been established on Rue Conty since 1929 and have been operating for seven years. In June 1931, they were once closed down. We, the undersigned, jointly sent a letter to the French Consul General Fevrier, requesting permission to establish the stalls, and the request was approved. Since the establishment of the vegetable stalls on Rue Conty, the market has prospered and the businesses of the shops have been able to develop. The police's closure this time was caused by the relocation due to road repairs. In fact, it has nothing to do with traffic. At a time when commerce is extremely depressed and the people's livelihood is difficult to the extreme, the revitalization of the market is of utmost importance. We, the undersigned, feel that our relationship with the vegetable vendors is interdependent and cannot stand idly by. We hereby jointly petition Your Excellency the Consul General to safeguard commerce and order the Municipal Council to allow the establishment of vegetable stalls on the east end of Rue Conty to the end of Rue Louvain, to maintain the commercial market. This is for the public good. We humbly submit this petition to His Excellency Baudens, Consul General of the French Republic in Shanghai."</p>
<h3 id="e117">After Effective Production-Sales Cooperation, Match Industry Develops Relief Plan, Expanding Overseas Sales, Balancing Production and Sales, Small Factories Merge for Operation and Improve Products <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>According to the Industrial and Commercial News Agency, since the implementation of the production-sales cooperation policy in the domestic match industry, the industry has gradually recovered in just three months. A reporter interviewed a prominent merchant in the industry, who provided detailed information about the future development and relief plan. This is divided and recorded below:</p>
<p>Restricting Factory Establishment, Expanding Markets: Foreign merchants establish factories in China based on the commercial treaties signed in the past. The factory sites are mostly located in concessions where Chinese government orders do not apply. They also employ Chinese workers at low wages and use cheap Chinese raw materials to sell locally. Therefore, the domestic match industry is subject to the exploitation of foreign merchants. To protect the industry, China should promulgate measures to restrict the establishment of factories by foreign merchants. They must be registered and strictly examined before being allowed to establish factories to limit them. According to experts' estimates, domestic matches can produce 1 million cases annually, but domestic consumption is less than 700,000 cases. Therefore, in order to achieve a balance between production and sales, it is necessary to expand sales channels and develop overseas markets.</p>
<p>Reducing Import Taxes: China is already able to supply most of the raw materials for matches. However, several types of raw materials, such as red phosphorus, green barium sulfide, and paraffin oil, still need to be imported. The government should carefully examine the situation and reduce tax rates, and eliminate handling fees, so that Chinese merchants can reduce costs and expand sales channels. In addition, foreign matches sold at prices lower than cost should be subject to dumping duties.</p>
<p>Improving Quality, Merging Small Factories: Improving the quality of matches is the most important task at hand. In the past, Chinese matches were once sold in the Philippines and Manila, but they were stopped because (a) the matches were difficult to strike, and (b) the matchboxes were easily blocked. These are the points that need to be improved urgently. Since the implementation of production-sales cooperation, business has not been as bleak as in the past. However, domestic capital is weak and should be merged for operation to achieve large-scale production.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Two Rice Stores on Guangfu Road, Zhabei, Fined for Underreporting Quarterly Donations, Landlord Also Liable <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The two rice stores, Jingcheng Rice Store at No. 297 and 299 Guangfu Road, Zhabei, and Qingda Rice Store at No. 293 next door, were found to have underreported their quarterly donations by Liu Wenzhan and Huang Xiting, investigators from the Municipal Finance Bureau's North District Tax Collection Office. The report was submitted to the office, which was forwarded to the Public Security Bureau, ordering Liao Jiongran, director of the Xinzha Branch, to investigate and punish them. After receiving the order, Director Liao immediately issued it to officer Huang Chongren, who dispatched police to summon Wang Changsheng, a partner of Jingcheng, 28 years old, and Hua Zhongjie, an accountant of Qingda, also 28 years old. Both partners were local residents. They both stated that the rent was set by the landlord Zhou Ziqi and denied underreporting the quarterly donations. Later, the monthly rent payment records were extracted and found to be inconsistent with the figures on the rent receipts. Jingcheng's actual monthly rent was 84 yuan, while the rent receipt only showed 48 yuan, underreporting 36 yuan per month. Qingda's actual monthly rent was 132 yuan, while the rent receipt also only showed 48 yuan, underreporting 84 yuan per month. Police were dispatched to</p>
<p>Summon the landlord Zhou Ziqi on Gonghe New Road and Heding Road, and rental contracts were retrieved to prove that the landlord and tenants colluded to underreport. After verification by Officer Huang, it was found that Jingcheng had underreported a rent of 36 yuan per month from March to the end of September this year, totaling seven months, amounting to 252 yuan. At 14%, the quarterly donation payable was 17 yuan, 6 jiao, 4 fen. A fine of 20% was imposed, amounting to 13 yuan, 5 jiao, 2 fen, 8 li, for a total of 21 yuan, 1 jiao, 6 fen, 8 li. Qingda, on the other hand, had underreported a rent of 84 yuan per month, also for seven months, amounting to 588 yuan. The quarterly donation payable was 41 yuan, 1 jiao, 6 fen, and the fine was 8 yuan, 2 jiao, 3 fen, 2 li, for a total of 49 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, 2 li. In addition, Jingcheng owed 21 yuan, 1 jiao, 6 fen for the autumn quarter donation, and Qingda owed a total of 64 yuan, 8 jiao for the spring, summer, and autumn quarter donations, which were combined for collection.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Industry Association's Shanghai office issued a notice to all members yesterday, stating:</p>
<p>"Notice is hereby given that the winter tobacco and alcohol licenses applied for by the members have been issued and dispatched to be distributed separately. All tax authorities have ordered the filling out of business status forms, ordering them to be filled out and reported quarterly, which is complicated. The association was requested to handle this on their behalf. This association has submitted a separate report to the Ministry of Finance and the collection agency, explaining the difficulties in handling it and requesting that it be handled according to the case. This has been approved. As for the license, as a rule, a one-fen stamp is affixed for each yuan. If there are omissions or errors in the posting, a heavy penalty will be imposed. Now, the new stamp tax law has been promulgated, and there is a misunderstanding that each license must be affixed with a one-yuan stamp. The members, in times of economic recession, are unable to bear the burden and requested the association to argue on reasonable grounds. This association has repeatedly sent letters to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce requesting the Ministry of Finance to amend and abolish it. This has been approved, and starting from the winter season, licenses are allowed to not affix stamps. This notice is hereby given for your information."</p>

<h3 id="e124">Amidst the Closing of the National Games, Public Buses Collide Twice, City-Run and Private Chinese Buses Seek Progress, Driver's Tickets Seriously Injured, Eight People, Some Critically Ill <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the large number of spectators at the opening of the National Games made traffic management difficult, which was generally anticipated. Despite the painstaking coordination by Zhang Dengyi, head of the Traffic Division of the Games, the congestion of vehicles and the difficulty of directing them, such as the taxi parking lot being far from the main entrance of the Games, and the overloading of various public buses in order to solicit business, resulting in overturning and injuries, were all met with dissatisfaction by the general public. Unexpectedly, on the last day of the Games, a bloody tragedy occurred between drivers of Zhabei public buses and city-run public buses due to soliciting passengers, which was particularly unfortunate. The detailed situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Cause of the Tragedy: After the opening of the Games, the Traffic Committee resolved to dispatch 30 city-run public buses to maintain traffic at the Games, and designated Beisichuan Road and Qiujiang Road as the passenger station for city-run public buses, and Baoshan Road and Qiujiang Road as the passenger station for private Chinese public buses, in order to avoid disputes between the two sides over soliciting passengers. Unexpectedly, after the opening of the Games, there were fewer passengers on Beisichuan Road and Qiujiang Road, and the city-run public buses moved to the same address on Baoshan Road, where there were more passengers, so there were disputes over soliciting passengers. This is one of the causes of the tragedy. The city-run public buses have larger bodies and more comfortable seats, and are city-run, so the general drivers tend to ignore the speed limit, and also like to chase other vehicles in the middle of the road to win the favor of passengers, so other vehicles feel jealous. This is the second reason that led to the fight between the drivers of both sides.</p>
<p>Process of the Tragedy: At 10:30 am yesterday, driver No. 314 of the city-run public bus had a dispute with the driver of the private Chinese bus at the intersection of Baoshan Road and Qiujiang Road due to soliciting passengers. At that time, Jin Baoxian, director of the city-run public bus management office, took five or six drivers to persuade them to stop, and the verbal conflict led to a fight. Chen, a driver on the side of the city-run public bus, and Hu Jinpu were beaten on the spot and could not walk, and were immediately sent to the hospital for emergency treatment. The lives of the two were in great danger. Director Jin Baoxian suffered a serious head injury. On the side of the private Chinese public bus, ticket seller Fan Gongyu suffered a serious head injury with a knife mark seven inches long, and his life may be in danger. Ticket checker Bao Shilin suffered a serious back injury. Ticket checker Liang Guoming injured his eyes, hands and feet. Ticket checker Chen Xiaoping suffered a broken leg. Six or seven drivers suffered minor injuries. The area, which is a necessary route through the central area, was in chaos for half an hour. A large number of police officers were dispatched by the Public Security Bureau to suppress the situation before it was calmed down. However, the drivers on both sides were still angry.</p>
<p>Second Tragedy: Although the first tragedy was suppressed by the police, the remaining anger of the drivers on both sides did not subside. More than 20 drivers of the private Chinese bus company took a bus and stopped two city-run public buses near East Sports Road, dragging the drivers and ticket sellers down and beating them severely. For a time, the passengers on the bus jumped out of the bus to escape, resulting in many people with abrasions. Later, city-run public bus No. 1023 caught up from behind, and the driver and ticket seller also got off to help, resulting in more and more people gathering and fighting each other. Fortunately, the security team of the Games heard the alarm and rushed to the scene, and then they all dispersed. It is reported that ticket sellers No. 123 and No. 152 of the city-run public bus management were seriously injured, and driver Wang Amao was also injured in the waist, and his life was also in danger. The responsible personnel immediately sent them to Tongren Hospital for treatment by ambulance.</p>
<p>Attitude of the Authorities: The authorities of the Games paid close attention to the two fights between the drivers of both sides, which led to a tragedy involving human lives. It is reported that the cause of the accident will be thoroughly investigated and dealt with strictly.</p>

<p>The Zhabei Charity Group previously announced the marriage of eight women from its affiliated women's shelter, as there were many women in the shelter of marriageable age and no relatives to claim them. Within a week, the applications were full, and the group arranged for the men and women to meet and conducted detailed investigations into the family circumstances of each applicant. As a result, only one couple completed a happy marriage due to the failure of most couples to agree on the terms. After the group re-examined the man's situation and found it to be correct, it submitted the matter to the Social Bureau for the assignment of spouses. It has now been approved for the man to take the bride out for marriage with a guarantor, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Dada Shipping Company Held its Annual Shareholders' Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Surplus of 140,000 to Expand Company Business, Zhang Xiaoru Died, Du Yuesheng Concurrently General Manager</p>
<p>This port's Dada Shipping Company held its annual shareholders' meeting at 2 pm yesterday at the Huzhou Guildhall on Guizhou Road. More than half of the shareholders attended the meeting. Du Yuesheng was elected chairman and reported on the business overview of the 23rd year and the future expansion plan. The details are recorded by the Riri News reporter as follows:</p>
<p>Business Overview: After the meeting was held as scheduled, there was a three-minute silence for the former general manager Zhang Xiaoru, who died, to express condolences. Then, Chairman Du Yuesheng reported on the business overview of the 23rd year, saying that the business this year was affected by the decline of the countryside and the depression of all industries. Between spring and summer, passengers and goods were unusually light, and there was no certainty in the business at the beginning. Fortunately, since the summer, wheat has been harvested and the source has surged. The company's original ships were insufficient to allocate, and it had to rent Jiahe, Jiangjing and other Jianglun ships to meet the urgent need. In autumn and winter, the business was smooth. Although the annual freight revenue was slightly higher than the previous year, it was impossible to obtain practical results due to the large expenses such as ship rental, coal consumption and night work. In terms of passenger transport, the revenue was also slightly higher than the previous year due to the improvement of passenger treatment, the elimination of the bad habits of the tea room, and the creation of the Hu Qing route by Datong Small Wheels and the implementation of the Shanghai Qing Intermodal Transport. Although the annual settlement obtained a surplus of more than 140,000 yuan, the occurrence of the third party's disturbance throughout the year was fortunate to have survived the difficulties. However, the future is still long, and the hidden worries have not ended. It still requires our efforts.</p>
<p>Improvement Plan: Then, Deputy Manager Yang Guanbei reported on the process of building the new Dada ship (omitted) and the future improvement plan. (1) In order to respect the intention of the Navigation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications to create a model route for the Shanghai Yang route, our company will eliminate all kinds of bad habits on the ship and increase equipment to facilitate passengers. The measures that have been implemented include collecting 20% of the ticket price for silk tea room requests and wine fees, and the company will sell the berths in the unified cabin to eliminate the bad habits of the tea room monopolizing the berths. Other improvements, such as improving sanitary facilities and maintaining order, are gradually being implemented. (2) In the past two years, our company has been almost unable to cope with the occurrence of the third party. One wave has just passed halfway, and another wave has risen. Fortunately, none of them have been realized. However, the future is not optimistic. (3) Datong Wheel Bureau, jointly established by our company and Datong Company, has created Shanghai Qing Intermodal Transport. In the past year, the scale has been roughly established. Recently, Xinyun Company has opened the Zhen Qing route and the Beijing Shanghai Railway has implemented cargo intermodal transport, and price competition should not be underestimated. We are currently planning methods to resist and reduce the impact. (4) The company's ships start from Shanghai, and their final destination is Huo Jiaqiao in Yangzhou. Upstream, all the passengers and goods in the canal and the downstream river are handled by the Boluan Branch and the Gaoyou Shunhe Transport Company. Passengers and goods have always been transported by civilian ships, which are not economical in terms of time and money. In order to meet the needs of modern trends and facilitate merchants, our company established Datong Wheel Bureau and opened the Ning Qing shuttle, which is connected to the general company's ships. Since its implementation, merchants in Jiangbei have praised it. However, the Gaoyou Shaobo branches believed that the establishment of Datong's direct passenger and cargo traffic hindered their business. Gaoyou Zhihe and Datong Gaoyou Branch jointly resisted and refused Datong Small Wheels to dock at the wharf, causing a disturbance. Later, Chairman Wang of the Gaoyou Chamber of Commerce took the initiative to mediate, and the two companies evaluated and recovered the Shunhe and Datong Branch barges, Datong 30,000 yuan, Dada 20,000 yuan, and signed a contract to recover and self-operate. (5) Shaobo Branch repeatedly requested the company to recover and self-operate due to the difficulty in dividing the business scope due to the establishment of Datong. After many discussions, a false agreement was recently established to change it to the Huo Shao Bureau, and the business was merged, and the profits and losses were distributed according to the composition. From then on, all branches from Huoqiao to Qingjiang will be directly operated by the company, and the power will be unified and easy to manage. (6) In order to facilitate merchants and develop business, our company has established that the goods from Yaowan, Suqian, Bengbu and other places can be mortgaged to the bank with a bill of lading. In the future, we plan to extend it to Yancheng, Dongtai, Funing and other places, which is being planned.</p>
<p>Distribution of Profits: Supervisor Du Shaoru reported the accounts briefly, and then began to discuss the proposals. The board of directors proposed that the surplus of 148,516 yuan, 8 jiao, 3 fen and 9 li in the 23rd year, in addition to the statutory reserve, bonus and 1% dividend, the remaining funds should be used to reduce the cost of new ships. However, the proposed 1% dividend is now due to the company's addition of new ships and construction of warehouses, and there is a shortage of cash. It is proposed to pay 5 li first, and the remaining 5 li will be paid when the company's finances are abundant in the future. Please make a public decision on the case. It was resolved that a dividend of 1% should be paid, and the board of directors should find a way to clear it before the end of the lunar year.</p>
<p>Du Appointed General Manager: The general manager of Dada Company was originally Zhang Xiaoru. Zhang died in an accident a few days ago. Yesterday, the person in charge of the company told the Riri News reporter that the board of directors had appointed Chairman Du Yuesheng to concurrently serve as the general manager. In the future, the company's business will be further developed. Deputy Manager Yang Guanbei and Supervisors Du Shaoru and Zhang Weici were re-elected after the election, it is said.</p>

<p>Wonderful Performance Items, Finally Seeing the Disabled but Not Useless</p>
<p>Shanghai Blind Children's and Mute Schools at No. 290 Hongqiao Road, West Shanghai, has been established for more than ten years and has achieved outstanding results. It is a leader in special education in China. The school held an art exhibition and supplemented the graduation ceremony for blind students on the past two days. I was specially invited to visit and will record the grand occasion I saw below.</p>
<p>Guest Titles: It is estimated that Mrs. Wu, Zhu Shaoping, Yan Fuqing, Gui Yingsheng, Le Zhenbao, Wang Wanbai and other 500 people arrived the day before yesterday. Yesterday was Sunday, and thousands of people from all walks of life arrived, and students accounted for the majority. First, in the melodious music of the school's blind student band, we visited various workshops or performance exhibition rooms. The rattan displays of the blind school were colorful and beautiful. The mute shuttle paintings, sculptures, labor and other products were about a thousand pieces, exquisite and pleasing to the eye, which can be called a grand view.</p>
<p>Graduation Ceremony: It was held the day before yesterday afternoon. There were three blind students in the normal school and seven in the complete primary school. Mrs. Wu, the chairman of the board of directors of the Fuya School, personally gave the certificates. The blind students bowed and received the certificates, and retired after saluting. Their movements were lively, just like ordinary people. Then, Guo Zengtong, a graduate, gave a reply. He spoke English first and then Mandarin. His words were sincere and his tone was loud. The sound of praise from the guests filled the audience.</p>
<p>Artistic Performance: There were more than ten programs, among which the performances were skillful, wonderful and moving, such as the four-tone ensemble and piano solo by blind students. The rise and fall of the tone and the harmony were harmonious. The blind students piled up Luohan, sometimes like a tall building, sometimes forming a high tower. The movements were lively and the style was novel, which was truly commendable. The dumb students' performance was clear and audible, and the results were surprisingly amazing. During the performance, a dumb student first used hand gestures and other movements to express his will. The guests all understood the magic. Then, another dumb student translated the student's movements into words on the blackboard, and then a dumb student read them out in a loud voice. Although the tone was light and turbid and slightly indistinguishable, it was also clear and audible.</p>
<p>Hand-written Words: A teacher first taught the dumb students to use their fingers to bend and stretch to make dumb literary gestures, and the students immediately wrote a long English sentence on the blackboard with a pen, and then translated it into Chinese. The words and meanings were quite impressive. Other dances by dumb girls, Tan Tui by dumb boys, and the blind playing the piano to harmonize with the rhythm were all in sync, humorous and funny, which won a lot of applause. People who are blind and dumb have already suffered from disability and uselessness. Now, with the power of education, the blind can read and the dumb can speak, and they can also learn crafts and skills, turning disability into usefulness. The omnipotence of education is increasingly believed and confirmed here.</p>

The villas are all single and double residences with particularly wide openings and complete sanitary equipment. The construction has been underway for several months and will be fully completed by the end of the lunar year. Because the location is ideal and the rent is fair, it is said that the rent has been fully booked.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Training Class for Tea Room Staff of China Merchants Bureau Held Graduation Ceremony the Day Before Yesterday <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The New Life Training Class for Tea Room Staff of China Merchants Bureau, organized by the New Movement General Association, has been running for two months. However, tea room training is an unprecedented initiative in China and has attracted much attention from people from all walks of life. The organizational content and the graduation ceremony held by the class at 10 am the day before yesterday are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Organizational Content: The class was established on August 20, with the school site at Huazhan, Pudong, and a total of 120 students. There is one director and one deputy director, director Song Zhenduo, and deputy director Qi Fuming. It is divided into three groups: Teaching Affairs, Training Affairs, and General Affairs. Song Zhenduo is the head of the Teaching Affairs Office, Jiang Jingrong is the head of the General Affairs Group, and Song Chongli is the head of the Training Group. The subjects include: (1) Common Sense of Civics, (2) Common Sense of Service, (3) Spiritual Admonitions, (4) Military Training, (5) New Movement Theory, (6) Party Principles, (7) History and Geography, (8) Hygiene, (9) Mandarin. There are a total of nine subjects, and the management and teaching are particularly serious. After three months of strict training, the general knowledge of tea room staff has gradually increased, and their thinking has also been improved, which is truly commendable.</p>
<p>Guest Titles: Yesterday was the expiration of the first training period of the class. A graduation ceremony was specially held in the school's auditorium. The venue was newly decorated, and many guests from various agencies participated. There were Yan Baohang, representative of the New Movement General Association, Peng Hu, representative of the Ministry of Communications, Shi Zhonggang, special commissioner of the Chinese Seamen's Party Affairs, Wang Ya, representative of the Chinese Seamen's Union Special Commissioner's Office, Zhang Yaoming, representative of the Shanghai Branch of the Seamen's Union, Shao Xubai, representative of the General Labor Union, Lin Xueyan, representative of the Public Security Bureau, and dozens of representatives from various departments of the China Merchants Bureau. The gathering was a grand event for a while.</p>
<p>Graduation Ceremony: The class held a graduation ceremony, first with a military parade. Everyone was very energetic and the persuasion was also very quick and orderly. Then they entered the seats in an orderly manner. The opening order was as follows: (1) Stand at attention, (2) Sing the Party Song, (3) Bow to the Party-State flag and the portrait of the General President, (4) Read the President's Will, (5) , (6) Speeches by various guests, (7) Reply by the trainees, (8) Award Graduation Certificates, (9) Sing the New Movement Song, (10) Finish.</p>
<p>Chairman's Admonition: After Chairman Song Zhenfeng performed the rituals, he gave an impromptu speech, saying that the class was established on August 20 and has been in session for two months. The training is now complete and they will soon return to serve on the ships. People in the community recognized that the long-standing bad system of tea rooms was about to be reformed. However, when you were first transferred ashore, there were many rumors. Some said that the China Merchants Bureau was using the new life movement to transfer workers in order to lay off workers, and some said that they were drawing blood when inspecting their bodies, and now the workers are all pale and thin. These rumors disrupt the sight and hearing. Now, not only have workers not been laid off, but all workers are healthier than before. There are already facts to answer, so there is no need to say more. In the past, you yourselves thought that the status of tea room staff was humble, and you had no progressive thoughts and no polite behavior. Even when you first came to this class, you had this attitude. After two months of short-term training, your behavior and politeness have greatly improved. On the 9/18 Memorial Day, when we talked about the Dongsi provinces, you all shed tears. This is comforting. People have always thought that China's cultural level is too low and incurable. In you who have not received considerable education, your thoughts and behaviors have improved so much. In this post, I feel that China has great hope. Now that you are about to return to serve on the ships, you must maintain this spirit and fulfill some national obligations for the country. This is my hope.</p>
<p>Guest Speeches: First, Yan Baohang gave a speech, saying that he felt that the trainees were energetic and orderly, and the results were very satisfactory. The efforts and enthusiasm of the organizers and relevant groups have made this effect possible in such a short period of two months. Yesterday, I met Special Commissioner Yang, who also expressed great approval of the training of tea room staff. He had previously made a speech, hoping to continue the efforts and hoping that all private companies would also train workers, so that the Chinese shipping industry would be able to usher in a new era. Second, Peng Hu gave a speech, saying that if we can continue to work hard with this spirit, let alone revive the shipping industry, we will also rely on this to revive the Chinese nation. Wang Zhonggang gave a speech, saying that when he just arrived at the pier, he saw the well-trained marchers. He thought it was a military exercise. Only later did he know that it was the trained workers doing a military-style exercise. A group of disorderly workers, after a short period of training, became a well-organized team, which is really unprecedented. Zhang Yaoming gave a speech, saying that the enemy of China's labor movement is imperialism. Don't misunderstand the oppression of capital. We should cooperate between labor and capital to fight against the enemy imperialists. The rest of the speech was omitted. The meeting adjourned at 12 o'clock, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e141">New Edition of Lai Gutang's Epistolary Letters Published: Sixth Volume of the Chinese Literature Rare Book Series <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Literature Rare Book Series published by the Shanghai Magazine Company has been releasing two volumes every Saturday since the 14th of this month, without interruption. This allows subscribers to feel as though they are subscribing to a Chinese literature weekly magazine. The ordinary method of subscribing, which entails paying first and then receiving the books later, further enhances the excitement. Yesterday marked the sixth week, and the publication released was "New Transcripts of Famous Scholars' Letters from Lai Gutang," compiled by Zhou Lianggong during the late Ming and early Qing dynasties. It contains the calligraphy of many prominent figures from the late Ming Dynasty, representing a collection of letters. It was banned after the Qing Dynasty, and the entire book was destroyed. The value of letters that were disliked by the authorities is evident. Literary scholars cherished even a single excerpt, keeping it hidden away. During the Daoguang era, the Haishan Xianguan series reprinted it, but with many deletions, alterations, and revisions. This series is printed based on the original Lai Gutang edition, totaling over 120 pages and containing over 700 letters. Its meticulous editing and the light and graceful style of the writing make it a top-tier collection of letters. It is essential reading for those who love late Ming literature and relish reciting correspondence. Zhang Jinglu has proofread and annotated the book. Another collection, "A Collection of Unusual Neighboring Affairs," is reportedly also slated for inclusion in the series. The retail price for the popular edition is 50 cents, while the special edition is 70 cents. Mail orders from outside Shanghai are exempt from postage. The deadline for subscribing to the first series of books is the end of this month, with only ten days remaining. The popular edition costs only 17 yuan, while the special edition costs only 24 yuan. Payments can be made in installments, with monthly payments of just three to four yuan to acquire the entire series. Next week's release will be "The Golden Lotus." In response to reader demand, the third volume is being rushed into print and will be available as early as Thursday. The retail price for all five volumes is 1.50 yuan. Individual subscriptions are available for just 1.10 yuan, with the special edition priced at 1.60 yuan. There is also a large, exquisitely bound hardcover edition with a colored spine and gold stamping, priced at 1.50 yuan, but available for subscription at only 2 yuan. It is both beautiful and magnificent.</p>

<p>Respectfully, I have read today's issue of your newspaper regarding the Longzi case of Lu Xihou's false accusation of forging private documents and the details of the trial. As for what was recorded, at the time, accountant Li Ding specifically came to visit and persuade me to compromise, allowing the huge sum of two hundred seventy-eight thousand to be declared as a claim, and Lu would withdraw the accusation against me. I refused firmly, etc. This differs slightly from Longzi's original statement that accountant Li Ding came to visit and talk about the recent resolution of the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Industrial Bank, going to the liquidator and asking the liquidator to persuade me to compromise and allow the huge sum of one hundred seventy-eight thousand (that is, the 150,000 yuan of the Qunyi Syndicate capital taken over by Lu Xihou, who also had relatives and friends vouch in court that they would not claim debts during the liquidation period, about 123,000 yuan) to be declared as a claim, while Lu Xihou submitted a statement to the court declaring an error and withdrawing his own private statement. After the first creditors' meeting, Lu Xihou also intended to propose a new plan to pay 50%, but also asked the court to allow him to declare the aforementioned debt amount. The recent cause of the false accusation clearly arose from the failure to fulfill the request to declare the debt. I want to know that I can forgo being a judge, but I will never violate the law, etc. The slight discrepancy is probably because when Longzi made his statement, he was agitated and spoke quickly, and the reporter could not record everything, leading to this error. I hereby request a correction to clarify this. Sincerely, Yu Changzi, October 20th, 10 AM.</p>

<p>— (Drunken Woodcutter)</p>
<p>Conscience is like a mirror, but it is sometimes covered with dust, losing its original luster. When we look at it and find that the mirror is blurry, reflecting a dim image, we must wipe it clean with a dry cloth, and then the radiance of the face will appear. That is the day when a person's conscience is tormented, repents, and renews itself.</p>
<p>Indeed, one cannot see one's own face clearly, so by looking in a mirror, one can clearly see one's own image. I am angry, I am happy, but when I put down the mirror, I no longer recognize myself. Therefore, there are many sinful people in society, with ferocious faces, doing things that are harmful and contrary to reason, without realizing it. This is all because they refuse to look in the mirror, or even do not know what a mirror is! However, their fate is to not escape the net of the law, thus forming a clear precedent for society.</p>
<p>Although a huge mirror hangs high in society, people seem to be blind, unable to see it. Thus, the tide of evil in society is surging!</p>
<p>Young people: on the road we are taking, each of us must hold a mirror, constantly looking at it, so that we will not have regrets for stumbling.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Such is Shanghai <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>I recently saw an article in the Australian Victorian Daily, written by Mr. Laurie Aro, who had lived in Shanghai for many years. In it, as he was taking leave to return to Australia, he gives Shanghai a true portrayal.</p>
<p>He says:!</p>
<p>In films and novels, "the Paris of the Huangpu River" is often portrayed as an incredible city, full of luxury, wealth, debauchery, and even tropical flavors. These depictions can startle those who have been to Shanghai. Perhaps these are still impressions from the age of sailing ships, obtained by travelers far from Shanghai.</p>
<p>Modern Shanghai is not the Shanghai of films, novels, or dramas. Shanghai is cleaner than London, and life in Shanghai is not as luxurious as commonly said; it is cheaper than London and New York. Why does everyone say that the cost of living in Shanghai is terrifyingly high? I think that most returning overseas Chinese save up some money before returning home, and during their vacations, they still receive their salaries, so they put on a lavish display, which causes misunderstandings among the general public.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, finding a job these days is not easy. Although a small number of overseas Chinese drift to Shanghai and find jobs, most overseas Chinese are dejected, silent, and leave Shanghai.</p>
<p>Many films and novels portray Shanghai with suggestive backdrops. This is truly a joke. The climate of Shanghai is extremely lovable. Although Shanghai has cold winters and hot summers, the climate from October to December is so good that it can be said that no major city in the world can compare.</p>

<p>— Gao Ji'an</p>
<p>I remember last autumn, on the ferry crossing the Moji Strait on my way from Nagasaki to Tokyo, I met a movie star from Kyoto. Her name was Nakajima Yukiko, though she didn't tell me her real name. With a long face and a slender figure, she was a thoroughly Westernized beauty.</p>
<p>Having a woman in the same car made the long train ride to Tokyo very talkative. We talked about everything, past and present, Chinese and foreign. She told me that she was from Tokyo, that her father was a businessman, and that her mother had already died. Her father was still in Tokyo, and this time because her father was ill, she had specially given up filming on location in Unzen to rush back to visit him.</p>
<p>My hopes are all dashed. I only love my old mother. My father is okay too, but he's an alcoholic. He's only loyal to his business. He doesn't seem to miss me much. When my mother was alive, she loved me very much, but she's dead. The house in Tokyo is also eerily quiet, because I love movies, so I also live in Kyoto… Mr. Gao! Do you still have your parents?</p>
<p>"I have both, and they are both well."</p>
<p>"People with mothers are so happy. Are you going to see your mother when you return from Tokyo this time?"</p>
<p>"Of course. She's missing her son who's traveling abroad."</p>
<p>On the road with autumn yellow leaves, the train ran very quickly on the Tokaido Main Line. Passing Osaka, she pointed to the Osaka station and said again: "Next to Osaka there is a place called Takarazuka. Mother is from there. There's not a day that I don't miss her."</p>
<p>She was also very knowledgeable in literature. She was very familiar with Mushanokoji Saneatsu, Kikuchi Kan, etc. We talked very congenially. I tried my best to comfort her about her loss of her mother. Indeed, the Japanese ideal of a good wife and wise mother is worth the eternal remembrance of women.</p>
<p>Afterwards, in Tokyo, she also came to the Imperial Hotel to see me. It was said that her father's illness had also improved. She invited me to play, so I also spared some time from my busy schedule to go to Nikko with her once. The next day she returned to Kyoto and told me to stay in Kyoto for a while on my way back.</p>
<p>Because Tokyo was really annoying, things were always settled in geisha houses after drinking. I was tired of eating raw fish, and the jade garden of famous wine and First Love History gave me a slight relief with its pine aroma, but I left immediately. When the car arrived in Yokohama, I telegraphed ahead. The next morning, when the Fuji Limited Express train entered Kyoto Station, Yukiko was already waiting for me and immediately asked me to go to her house. There was no way, I had to obey. The first thing she did after arriving home was to show me a photo of her and her mother.</p>
<p>Two days later I left and made an appointment to see her again, and also told her my Shanghai address. After returning, we occasionally exchanged a few letters.</p>
<p>Cool autumn has come to the world again. On a desolate winter night, Yukiko must be missing her mother again!</p>

<p>Chapter 20: Struggling to See the Beloved Grandson, Embracing and Weeping Bitterly, Recalling the Past in a Year of Famine, Planting Wheat and Bringing Disaster</p>
<p>Madam Zhu said: You, madam, you don't know our plans! We thought we would find a son-in-law who was a master, to have some glory, but we didn't expect to send our child to jail. If we had known it would be like this… Old Madam Zhu interjected: We would rather starve to death together! What good is this? What can we do with more than a hundred silver dollars? Seeing that they were not being polite, Madam Zhou didn't bother to be polite with them either, and pulled out a square stool from under the table to sit on. She looked at Yueying, who was wearing a long, dark gray cloth coat, her hands and face washed very clean, her hair neatly combed with a long braid. Her curved eyebrows and big eyes showed her to be an intelligent person. She sat leaning against the table, constantly tugging at her collar, feeling very embarrassed. So she smiled at her and said: It's okay, we are all women, just talk casually. I have already heard about your coming to Xi'an to find relatives. Why did you leave your home to come to this place? Old Madam Zhu said: What is there to eat at home? What is there to live on? Who would want to leave! Madam Zhu also said: If her child's father were still alive, would we say anything? We wouldn't leave no matter what! Madam Zhou looked at the two of them. The blue cloth jackets and trousers they wore were like rags, completely loose and baggy. Not to mention how withered the old woman looked. Even Madam Zhu's face was yellowish-black, her skin had slight fish scale-like fine lines, and her hair was as dry as straw, reddish-yellow, indicating that this person had not been getting nourishment.

<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Although she did not sing triumphantly, there was indeed a faint, trembling melody in her voice; only because heaven had given her such a transcendent position, she dared not neglect her inherent dignity at any time and place, and even lost the freedom to sing, otherwise I think she would definitely hum a tune in the bathtub!</p>
<p>Speaking of dignity, the Empress Dowager naturally had her dignity! Even when bathing, naked and exposed in front of five women, her dignity remained unchanged; just as when she sat high on the dragon chair every morning, allowing many glorious princes and ministers to respectfully kowtow to her on the red steps in front of the palace. Whether she was dressed in magnificent finery or wearing something playful and thin before going to bed, her dignity was always fully maintained; from head to toe, there was not an inch that did not represent a supreme Empress Dowager. However, before she became the Empress Dowager, she was just an ordinary woman!</p>
<p>Readers must not have forgotten the scene when she inspected the relics of past emperors in the ancient palace in Fengtian? Seeing the infinite sorrow when she saw the relics of her husband, Xianfeng, and the sadness when she took the toy of her beloved son, Tongzhi, (that is, the little white rabbit with red eyes and a movable red tongue) back to her inner chamber and caressed it all night, we can know that in terms of diet, daily life, and even emotions, the Empress Dowager was the same as us; she just possessed a greater political power than ordinary people (440).</p>

<p>— Tu Xiaochao</p>
<p>I traveled to Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, etc. in late summer and early autumn, then turned back to Shanghai, passing through Wuning. My deepest impression was of the trip to Nanchang. Although Nanchang is the capital of Jiangxi Province, it is located in a remote inland corner. When I traveled there in the past, I felt that its streets were simple and crude, inferior to other cultural ports in the Yangtze River basin. In recent years, because Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek was stationed in Nanchang for many years to suppress the Red bandits, the city's population suddenly increased, and commerce gradually prospered. In addition, the provincial government painstakingly managed and strived to improve municipal administration and transportation. The main highway lines in all directions of Jiangxi have long been completed. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is also about to be single-tracked. All these roads take Nanchang as the hub. The railway passes through Nanchang, with a north and south station. The south station is magnificently built and will soon be completed. Nanchang's electricity and telephone services have long been properly reorganized and are extremely convenient to use. Tap water is also being planned and implemented, and it is planned to raise large sums of money to rebuild the scenic Tengwang Pavilion. In addition to building wide roads, Nanchang City has also opened up a new residential area in the north of the city, giving the city a new look. When I set foot here this time, I had a strong sense of the past and present!</p>
<p>In the past, I often felt that traveling in the interior of China was not only fraught with the dangers of difficult water and land transportation, but also that the hostels and restaurants where I stayed were cramped and the food was not to my liking. This kind of hardship in traveling was not unique to remote areas, and in the past, those who stayed in Nanchang were also quite worried about finding good food. This time when I was serving in Jiangxi Province, I also thought about the problem of accommodation and food. Later, in the ship and train car, I learned that Nanchang had recently established a Hongdu Guesthouse. It was said that the accommodation and food were very comfortable, so I went directly to the guesthouse and stayed for a few days. During these few days, it was beyond my expectations. The feeling of being uncomfortable with staying and eating in Nanchang was relieved, and I added a lot of fun to my travels.</p>
<p>I have lived in Shanghai for a long time and have been quite troubled by the noise and clamor. When I arrived at the guesthouse, I unpacked my luggage and immediately felt refreshed. The guesthouse is located in the middle section of Wang Yangming Road in the new residential area. The buildings are magnificent, the courtyards are spacious, the location is quiet, and the transportation is extremely convenient. Those who stay here always feel like they are in another world. They are happy with its elegance and free from the pain of hustle and bustle, which is why their mood is refreshed. In terms of equipment, it is no less than the major hotels in Shanghai. The Western and Chinese dishes are also exquisitely prepared, so many high-end travelers who come to Nanchang gather here. Because Nanchang's municipal administration has been updated and the food is more comfortable, I have a particularly deep impression of my trip to Nanchang, so I am writing this down.</p>

<p>Economic Supplement</p>
<h3 id="e154">Trends in Rose's Work in China <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— Sen Yu</p>
<p>Before Rose arrived in Shanghai, the author predicted in issue 142 of this publication that Rose's key objectives in China would be fourfold: (1) to consolidate past loans and investments, (2) to provide new, independent loans to China, (3) to bring China into the Sterling Area, and (4) to establish a foundation for dealing with Japan. Observing Rose's recent words and actions, what he has expressed directly and indirectly seems to align quite well with our previous speculations. Therefore, we will further examine Rose's work trends from an objective perspective:</p>
<p>(1) Consolidating Past Loans and Investments</p>
<p>This item seems less important in Rose's work and is largely passive. Therefore, most people have not paid much attention to it. However, we believe that this issue is by no means a simple "debt collection problem," but rather contains the significance of consolidating the British economic front in China. Historically, British loans and investments in China have often been secured by important tax revenues and railway interests, with the actual control of China's customs and salt taxes largely in British hands. Recently, Japan, the United States, and others have been attempting to squeeze out Britain's superior position, especially Japan's ambition to seize customs rights, which has become more active. To maintain the strength of its fortress, even if Britain does not intend to demand repayment of debts from China, it must use the name of consolidation to deploy its new front. Rose's recent collection of information, especially focusing on China's debt situation and tax revenues, is likely to prepare for a comprehensive and thorough reorganization of Sino-British debt relations. On the one hand, this means presenting a list of debts to China, but on the other hand, the main purpose is to re-establish clearly the "debt collateral" to prevent other countries from coveting it.</p>
<p>However, according to our observation, the work of consolidating past Sino-British debts and investments is quite heavy and may not be completed in the short term. As for this economic front, if there are no other forces to protect it at the same time, it will still be vulnerable under Japan's drastic measures. The previous examples of the Beining Railway and the Kailuan Coal Mine can serve as clear lessons.</p>
<p>(2) Providing Independent Loans and Investments to China</p>
<p>(1) Collateral for Loans Rose once told reporters about the issue of loans to China, saying, "It depends on the nature of the collateral." This indicates that loans to China must be conditional, and the so-called "collateral" will obviously further involve China's economic sovereignty and financial administration. Rose's special emphasis on China's debt situation and tax revenues, as mentioned above, is also a preparation for finding new collateral. The main target of this collateral is undoubtedly China's tax revenues and other state-owned enterprises (railways, mines, etc.)'s income. If a Sino-British loan agreement is indeed established and secured by a certain tax revenue or state-owned industry, Britain will further manipulate China's tax affairs and state-owned enterprises in the name of supervision and auditing. As a result, Britain will not only directly control China's financial lifeline but also indirectly promote the favorable development of trade and investment.</p>
<p>(2) Private Targets for Loans and Investments Rose is well aware that negotiating with the Chinese government will be subject to various constraints and may not be smooth. It is also necessary to engage in various agreements with private groups and individuals outside the government, and China's financial and industrial circles are the best targets. Rose's meetings with leaders of Shanghai's financial and industrial circles in recent days are not without this important intention.</p>
<p>(3) Main Direction of Investment The North of China may not have room to intervene, the Northwest is not smooth, and the Central region also has many constraints. Although the Southwest has recently been threatened by Japan and will conflict with France, it is still the best option in a situation where there is almost no other choice. Moreover, with Hong Kong by sea and India by land, it is easier to enter and exit. Therefore, the current center of British activity in China seems to be in the Southwest (naturally, it does not absolutely abandon the Central and Northwest regions; activities are still carried out within the possible scope). Rose's recent work also seems to focus on this area, and the actively progressing major transportation network plan in the Southwest provinces is an important step to lay the foundation. Secondly, operating in the Southwest is not only the foundation for entering and exiting China, but also plays a huge role in the future world structure. When the Southwest, India, Burma, Hong Kong, and even Singapore are integrated, the British position in the Pacific will take a superior position.</p>
<p>The above three items are the main trends of British activities in raising loans and making new investments. The final decision of their future will depend on the evolution of the future international situation and China's final attitude. However, according to our current speculation, we dare not be fully optimistic for Britain: (1) The collateral for loans affects China's financial sovereignty, which will be opposed by the Chinese people, and will inevitably arouse the jealousy of international imperialism, especially Japan, and hinder it; (2) Although investing in China's private sector is more likely to succeed, it is expected that it will also arouse resentment from the United States and other countries and must overcome many difficulties; (3) Japan has recently stepped up its expansion into the Southwest, and the power of France cannot be underestimated. Therefore, Britain's operation in the Southwest will at least cause a three-way confrontation between Britain, Japan, and France, and various accidents will occur.</p>
<p>(3) Persuading China to Join the Sterling Area</p>
<p>Although Rose avoids mentioning persuading China to join the Sterling Area, he has stated that he will conduct detailed research on China's economy, especially its currency system, which provides some clues. Moreover, objective facts show that this work is a necessary part of Rose's visit to China. The reason why he is so secretive is to avoid various constraints.</p>
<p>Recently, some financial figures have been vocal about China joining the Sterling Area, and there have been proposals to immediately link Sino-British exchange rates, which is indeed a matter worthy of attention. They believe that the root cause of China's economic panic at this stage lies in the excessive silver exchange rate and the contraction of currency, ignoring other political and economic fundamental factors and placing all the responsibility for the panic on the currency, which is putting the cart before the horse. We feel that after China joins the Sterling Area, it will lose its independent monetary sovereignty (some people think that the issue of sovereignty is only nominal and not important in practice; if so, then the entire national sovereignty can also be considered only nominal, and it may be okay to give it away casually. I wonder if this is acceptable). Moreover, the exchange rate will fluctuate with the pound, and there is still no possibility of stability. This kind of vassal-like development will make China's economic panic even more serious. Some people say that the Japanese yen is also related to the pound and has not caused any harm. Therefore, they hastily conclude that China joining the Sterling Area is harmless and beneficial, which is extremely absurd! The relationship between the Japanese yen and the pound and China's joining the Sterling Area are inherently different in nature. Even if the natures are the same, I wonder if China and Japan have the same national status? In short, China's joining the Sterling Area has more disadvantages than advantages, and we dare not welcome it.</p>
<p>As for the international impact of China joining the Sterling Area, it will be very serious and need not be repeated. The strong opposition from the United States and Japan is inevitable.</p>
<p>(4) Establishing a Foundation for Dealing with Japan</p>
<p>Regarding Sino-Japanese relations, Rose may continue to try to coordinate with Japan. However, there is little hope, and even if possible, it is only within a very narrow limit. Japan's ambition will never make Britain feel at ease. Therefore, on the one hand, Britain has to seek ways to resist. It is estimated that his work mainly has three aspects: (1) using international forces to prevent the expansion of Japanese power, (2) uniting to resist Japanese aggression, and (3) broadly establishing a foundation for dealing with Japan at all levels of China's economy and politics. However, (1) international relations are complex and not absolutely reliable; China's current strength is too weak, and there are too many constraints; as for (3), such as seizing China's financial power, monetary power, and operating in the Southwest, etc., are all strategies for both offense and defense, but unfortunately, there are too many obstacles.</p>
<p>Above, we have summarized and analyzed the various tasks that Rose has done, should do, and will do in China this time. As the objective situation shows, the results may not be entirely as Britain hopes. However, it cannot be absolutely certain that nothing will be achieved. The following items may be more likely to be gained: (1) A deeper understanding of Japan's ambition can be a very important lesson for the British government; (2) The information obtained from the investigation and study of China's economic situation can be good reference materials for the British government; (3) The past debt relationship between China and Britain may be able to agree on a principle of consolidation; (4) Several cooperative enterprises may be established in the private sector; (5) If a loan is established within a certain limit, some benefits may be obtained on railways and mining. Among the above items, (1) and (2) are no problem; but (3) is still far from reality and needs to be discussed again in the future; as for (4) and (5), they are only "possible" and still need to overcome multiple obstacles. The recent tension in the European and African situation and Japan's general mobilization of its China policy will make Rose's work more and more difficult!</p>
<h3 id="e155">Review of the Land Village Ownership System <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Honggen</p>
<p>The land issue has always been a central issue in politics. In primitive societies, land was originally public. By the Three Dynasties, it evolved into the Well-Field System. After Qin Shi Huang unified the world, the private ownership system was established, and the concentration of land increased daily, which greatly affected the relations of production in society. Therefore, after each dynasty's political changes, the victors invariably took the reform of the land system as the most urgent task, using it as a slogan to stabilize the people's hearts. Most of these reforms aimed to prevent the concentration of land ownership. The most popular ones were Wang Mang's Royal Land System during the Wang Mang period, the Bai Xing Land Occupation Law of the Western Jin Dynasty, the Equal-Field System of the Later Wei Dynasty, the Eternal Property and Naked Land System of the Sui Dynasty, the Hereditary Portion System of the Tang Dynasty, and the Limited Restriction System of the Song Dynasty. However, few of them were effective, and in the end, almost all of them abandoned their policies, and the land returned to the path of private concentration. Since the Ming Dynasty, the facts and degree of annexation have become increasingly severe. From the Qing Dynasty to today, there has been no thorough remedy. According to reports, Yan Xishan of Shanxi Province advocated the land village ownership system to prevent the spread of the Red Disaster. Its main points are:</p>
<p>(1) The village office issues public bonds to collect all the land in the village for public ownership.</p>
<p>(2) The land is divided into several plots according to its nature and distributed to the villagers for cultivation.</p>
<p>(3) Farmers receive and return the land at the beginning and end of their cultivation age. If there are too few land and too many people or too much land and too few people, it will be adjusted by immigration.</p>
<p>(4) The public bonds for buying land are repaid with income from industrial property protection tax, income tax, and non-labor tax.</p>
<p>Mr. Yan's advocacy of this method has a very far-sighted vision, and in principle, it is indisputable. However, in view of the past experience of land reform success, certain unavoidable difficulties will inevitably be encountered in practice. I hereby contribute three opinions on this method within my humble knowledge, and I dare not decide whether they are right or wrong, just for the reference of the people of the country.</p>
<p>(A) The Problem of Scarcity and Unevenness of Cultivated Land China's farmers today are generally suffering from a shortage of cultivated land, but there is no exact proof of how much it is insufficient. According to the results of the survey conducted by the National Government's Accounting Office in 1933, each household has an average of 2.1 acres of cultivated land. Mr. Zhang Xinyi estimated that each person has 3.6 acres of cultivated land. Cressy estimated that each person has 0.4 acres of cultivated land. Baker estimated that each household has 2.85 acres of cultivated land. The survey of 13 places in Jin Dalu Province showed that each household has an average of only 2.52 hectares. The United States has an average of 3.6 acres of lower land per day, which is about nine times larger than China, and each household has 57 acres of cultivated land, which is about 18 times larger than China. In the case of China's small cultivated land area, we found that there is no large-scale concentration as in foreign lands. Therefore, the core of today's land distribution problem is not the re-division of already cultivated land, but the area of arable land that has not been cultivated. According to Mr. Weng Wenhao's estimate (Cone Finger Collection), the area of arable land in China is one million square miles. Baker estimated that it is 700 million acres, which is too high. According to the survey conducted by the National Government's Accounting Office in 1933, the area of cultivated land is 1,248,781,000 acres, which is about 189,814,72 acres. However, the actual number is definitely more than this, because some cultivated land is not reported for tax avoidance purposes, so it is difficult to be accurate. Zhang Xinyi's food source survey in 14 provinces stated that except for the four northeastern provinces, the expansion of cultivated land area in the other nine provinces is unlikely to exceed 5% of the existing cultivated land. The implementation of the Well-Field System was due to the sparse population and abundant land, so it was still possible to measure and distribute land according to the population, as Gou Yue said (quoted from Tong Kao, Volume 1): "Moreover, the Well-Field System is not suitable for times of large populations. When land is vast and people are few, it is feasible." Therefore, in today's time of heavy population, the difficulty of implementing the land distribution system must be greater than that of the Well-Field or Equal-Field System in the past. The possibility of expanding uncultivated land is so small that it is not allowed by facts to make the land distribution system last for a long time.</p>
<p>(B) The Amount of Fertile and Barren Land Varies from Village to Village Yan's proposal is to distribute land to villagers according to the land in each village. The first problem is that villages have sizes, and the distribution of land is still not equal. Some people think that small villages have less land and fewer people, and large villages have more land and more people, which is fair. In fact, the area of villages in the South is mostly smaller than that in the North, and the population density is higher than that in the North, which can be seen from the difference between population density and land distribution. According to Mr. Yan's proposal, if the land in the village is not enough to distribute, then people without land will find a way to make a living, or move into villages with surplus land to adjust it. This is common practice under the current private land ownership system. If the land is made public and given to the people, then who would not want to have land to cultivate and live in their hometown, and would rather go out to make a living. Especially in our country, with a strong sense of family and hometown, unless there is the oppression of natural disasters and man-made disasters, no one is willing to leave their hometown easily, so the result will inevitably lead to some disputes. In terms of the quality of soil, fertility is different. If it is forced to be divided into several plots, then everyone will inevitably compete for fertile land. As Sheng Ruzhi said in "Shuzhai Laoxue Congtan," the strangeness of the terrain, the unevenness of the soil, and the unevenness of water and drought are all difficulties in dividing the Well-Field. According to Zhou Guan, the number of fields received by each husband is not limited to one hundred mu, as Mencius said. As Da Situ said, "Use the method of soil equalization to distinguish five things and nine grades to determine the land of the world, levy it to make people's taxes, order land tribute, verify wealth, and equalize the politics of the world." Therefore, there are two types of land distribution systems in the Zhou Dynasty. "In the countryside, the upper land is one chen per husband, and the field has mu? Lai fifty mu, and the rest of the husbands are the same; the middle land is one chen per husband, and the field is one hundred mu, and Lai is one hundred mu, and the rest of the husbands are the same; the lower land is one chen per husband, and the field is one hundred mu, and Lai is two hundred mu, and the rest of the husbands are the same." "In the cities, families that are not easy have one hundred mu, families that are easy once have two hundred mu, and families that are easy twice have three hundred mu." This distribution method is just to make it tend to be average, but in fact, the handling must be very complicated. Now, if the land of a village is granted to the villagers, if it is not graded, then it is not as fair as the Well-Field. If it is to be graded, then its complexity is unavoidable.</p>
<p>(C) The Difficulty of Re-Dividing According to the provisions of Article 13 of the Village Public Ownership Plan, the public office should re-divide the plots at appropriate intervals according to the increase in population and the land improvement situation. This is easy to say but difficult to do. Unmarried farmers must continue to reach the age of cultivation to apply for land, and at the same time, there are constantly elderly farmers returning land to the village office. This matter of granting and returning land is extremely heavy. If it is accumulated for several years or ten years before re-division is carried out once, then what will the farmers who have reached the age of receiving land do before the re-division? Moreover, for those who have already received land, they have been guarding their land for several years. If they are asked to cultivate other land, they will be unwilling to improve their land or exhaust their land before re-division. Therefore, after several years, the productivity of the land must be greatly reduced, and the situation of the farmers has not improved. The reason why the Equal-Field System of the Northern Dynasties, Sui, and Tang could not last for a long time was partly due to the disorder of the land registration book, which eventually led to the land being granted without being equal. The lessons of the past can be learned. Now, how will it be corrected?</p>
<p>(D) About the Village Office All land surveying, population registration, and land distribution matters are handled by the village office. Then, the person in charge must have received considerable training in the above matters to avoid errors. Today's rural education is so naive that most farmers do not know what land public ownership is. In addition, the village office may not have the necessary knowledge and experience to handle land distribution matters, which may arouse farmers' suspicions that the government is plotting to seize their land, which will ultimately be fruitless or even lead to farmers' resistance. Moreover, the villagers are of mixed quality. Some of them are local bullies and ruffians who have no land to stand on, but they get land because of this. At the same time, some lazy and extravagant farmers who have lost their land ownership also enjoy the same opportunity. Ordinary diligent farmers who originally had dozens of acres of land and had a well-to-do family may not only fail to improve their situation after the land is heavily levied, but may also suffer losses. This phenomenon is especially prone to occur in areas with low tenant rates. Moreover, local bullies and ruffians often collude with local tyrants and gentry to control the village office. All land distribution procedures are handled by them, and fertile land is allocated to themselves or their relatives for cultivation, and the remaining inferior land is distributed to others.</p>
<p>(E) About Income Tax All those who receive cultivated land must pay one-tenth of their income as labor income tax as part of the guarantee for the repayment of public bonds. Mencius said, "The Xiahou clan paid tribute at fifty, the Yin people helped at seventy, and the Zhou people used Che for one hundred mu. In fact, all of them were one-tenth." Later generations were confined to the saying of one-tenth and competed to make associations, some said that it was due to the difference in the urgency of the government, and some said that it was due to the difference in the length of the ruler, and there was no consensus. Now, if the farmers who receive land are also required to pay one-tenth of their harvest, is it fair? The fertility of the land is unequal, and the yield per mu is different. Under today's tenancy system, rent and grain are all based on the yield per mu, and the percentage of the rent and tribute paid by both parties varies greatly, with so-called split halves, three-sevenths, four-sixths, two-eights, etc., all aiming to balance the interests of both parties. Now, if a uniform labor income tax of one-tenth is levied, then the burden on farmers who cultivate good land and farmers who cultivate inferior land cannot be balanced.</p>
<p>(F) Can Public Land Ownership Permanently Prevent Annexation? Today, most of the larger landlords have a considerable relationship with the local politics. Even if they are temporarily ordered to release their land, they cannot prevent the matter of forced sale. The farmers' land is annexed by the powerful, but they still have to bear the taxes. This can be seen from the implementation of the Equal-Field System in the Northern Dynasties, Sui, and Tang Dynasties, as Mr. Yu Guoding said, "The Equal-Field System equally grants good land, but the number of fugitive households is the highest in the Northern Dynasties, Sui, and Tang Dynasties, which implemented the Equal-Field System... The Western Han Dynasty did not grant people land but levied rent per mu, so the household tax was lighter. Since the implementation of the Equal-Field System, the land rent has also been levied per household, so the household tax has greatly increased. However, the granting and receiving of land is only carried out when the politics are clear and there are many people with few land. When the compliance is temporary and the name is not real, the powerful annex land and the poor lose land. The officials do not grant land again, but the heavy taxes cannot be reduced again, so they become a serious disease for the people and flee together, not because they are sick of having land, but because they are fleeing heavy taxes."</p>
<p>The above points are about the discussion of the land village ownership system itself. In addition, there are several more basic problems, which are also listed below.</p>
<p>(A) Public or Private Land Ownership, Which is More Beneficial? It has been said before that land originally belonged to the public in primitive times, but the result of social evolution has universally created a phenomenon of private ownership. The successive formation of this trend is not accidental, and there must be the impetus of its background. Because private ownership and possession are the nature of human beings, since the establishment of the private ownership system, individuals have been willing to work hard to seek the enrichment of their own pockets. The economic and cultural progress of society is also based on this. Since the development of individualism and free competition in Europe, the progress of industry and commerce has been rapid. Most of the transportation and other public utilities in the United States today are operated by private individuals, and their efficiency and spirit of service are no less than those of state-owned enterprises, and their motivation is to focus on self-interest. Therefore, whether land should be public or private is a question that should be carefully considered.</p>
<p>(B) Today's Land Problem or the Entire Agricultural Problem is Not Limited to Distribution Aspects As mentioned, the land use problem is also extremely important. Today, Chinese farmers invest a lot of manpower in land. Compared with the United States, the production of cotton per hectare in China requires 1,620 hours of labor, while the United States only needs 289 hours. Sorghum in China requires 637 hours, while the United States only needs 48 hours. The situation of other crops is the same. (According to Buck's survey of Chinese farmhouses and the statistics of the 1921 US Agricultural Yearbook) Although China uses a lot of manpower on land, its output is still not as high as that of other countries. According to Tawney's research (Land and Labor in China), the yield of rice per mu in Japan is 2,350 pounds, while China is only 1,750 pounds. The yield of wheat per mu in England and Wales is 32.9 bushels, while China ranks ninth with only 10.8 bushels. The yield of corn is the highest in the United States, at 27.8 bushels, while China ranks sixth with 11.7 bushels. From this, it can be seen that the effectiveness of today's Chinese agricultural workers is far less than that of other countries. Therefore, if we improve the means of production on a limited area and increase the yield per mu, it will also greatly improve the lives of farmers. Other aspects such as agricultural finance, agricultural product marketing, rural education, and hygiene need to be thoroughly reformed, and we cannot ignore them. By starting simultaneously from various aspects, the recovery of China's rural economy can be expected.</p>
<p>(C) The Crisis of Using Agriculture as the Basis for Supporting the Population "Relying on agriculture to build the country" has almost become a cliché among the Chinese people. This sentence can indeed represent China's past or present economic situation. However, whether we can continue to rely on agriculture to build the country in the future is a question that needs to be considered. Most of the irrigable land in mainland China has been exhausted. The irrigable land in the future is limited to several places on both sides of the Yellow River and the three northeastern provinces. According to experts, even if agriculture is scientifically implemented, its output is unlikely to exceed the existing 20% to 50%. At most, it will only temporarily slightly improve the living standards of farmers. After a considerable period, it will inevitably return to the previous state of poverty. Most of the major powers have now moved from agricultural civilization to industrial civilization, and large factories have absorbed the surplus population, making the land distribution problem easier to solve. There are several difficulties in China's industrialization at present. First, there is a lack of financial and human resources. Second, there is a shortage of minerals and power raw materials. Third, it is not easy to compete with other countries in the world market. As a result, it is still ineffective. Therefore, we can only seek the simultaneous development of agriculture and industry at present. On the one hand, we should promote the country's industry to a considerable extent, and on the other hand, we should strive to improve agriculture, so as to adjust the shortage of cultivated land and stabilize the foundation of the country's economy.</p>
<p>Finally, we admit that seeking land distribution reform in China today is not meaningless. It can solve the livelihood problems of the people to a considerable extent. Public land ownership is not absolutely impossible. If there is a very detailed plan that can overcome the various difficulties of the previous public ownership system, it will have great value. Therefore, we hope that the proponents can continue to study its theory and implementation steps so that the village public ownership system can truly achieve the goal of liberating farmers.</p>

<h3 id="e156">Finance The Expiry Date Was Amicably Resolved <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>—The next two periods will be handled in the same way—</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 21st), the situation regarding the maturity of long-term debts on the 10th was very tense. The debtors always attributed their inability to repay to the market situation, making rollovers inevitable. However, creditors, in order to protect their own interests and avoid risks, had to try to contract. As a result, the gap was still significant. A general overview was detailed in yesterday's report. All Chinese banks had largely agreed on this the day before yesterday (the 19th) after much effort. The details of most of the transfers were also detailed in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday was a Sunday, and most banks were closed, so the arrangements were made a day in advance. As for the long-term loans owed to and from money shops, although some matured the day before yesterday, a considerable amount was cleared yesterday after several negotiations. Of the total amount of over 7.7 million, 3 to 4 million was settled yesterday by both parties. It is said that the terms of the adjustment were difficult to accept. However, the Chamber of Commerce had sent a letter to the Money Trade Association, asking for amicable handling. For debtors who genuinely had unavoidable difficulties and could not repay as desired, the request was reluctantly granted, allowing rollovers. Therefore, creditors did not dare to demand too much, and the situation was resolved where possible. Those that could not be collected were rolled over. However, the interest rate was 5 jiao higher than the market rate, hence the market price of 9.5 to 10 yuan. The long-term loans from Ningbo banks in Shanghai were also negotiated several times, with less than 50,000 to 60,000 being recovered. The remaining large amounts of long-term debts were all rolled over at the request of the Chamber of Commerce. Therefore, the total transaction volume yesterday was no less than ten million or more. As for the two major expiry periods (the 25th and the end of the month) that have not yet arrived, the amounts are very large. We predict that the outcome will be no different from yesterday's. However, some of the more solid debtors may be able to repay, but most of them will have uncollectible receivables due to accounting relationships, and it is inevitable that they will request rollovers. Looking back at the foundation of the money shops themselves, after the Ministry of Finance issued financial public bonds, and with the gradual contraction of business, the adjustment of capital can also be managed smoothly, and there will be no major crisis. Moreover, a few money shops have had shareholders add additional capital, so the overall situation does not seem to have any impact. However, new customers are not being given loans, and stores that want to rely on the financial sector for assistance feel very difficult. Before the end of this month, it is inevitable that some stores will be unable to maintain operations and will declare liquidation. We hope that our predictions are incorrect.</p>

<p>Last week (October 14th to 19th), the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange market was still in turbulent waters. The supply and demand of market chips changed with the environment. People's sentiment was always weak. The big players, both bulls and bears, seemed to be quite firm on the surface, but in reality, they had mostly moved their positions imperceptibly. The sellers' preparation for delivery was indeed a fact. Given the large quantities on both sides, the barriers were extremely high. Even without environmental changes, the momentum of mutual friction would have been significant. Moreover, with only five days left before settlement, the swap operations of both the bulls and bears in recent days had been quite busy. It could be predicted that the changes within the day would still be quite remarkable. The environmental rumors were particularly absurd and terrifying. The rumors were more intense on Monday of last week compared to the previous week, and there was also news of war between Japan and Russia. Prices fell more and more drastically from morning to night. The Disbandment Bonds fell by 2.1 jiao. Number 16 was shorting heavily, and Number 54 was bullish. Numbers 46, 69, and 78 were all mainly selling, revealing the latest new low prices. The rumors about the new Chinese policy on Monday grew more and more intense. Number 16 was still shorting heavily, and the northern gangs were also pouring out, and the decline did not abate. New low prices continued to be discovered. Although it rebounded slightly at the end, it still fell by about 0.5 yuan. On Wednesday, the market conditions were unpredictable, and the selling pressure was still strong. Number 48, a long position, released a small number of shares. Number 16 continued to add to their short positions. There were a lot of rumors in the market. The situation between Britain and Italy was also gradually deteriorating. The Disbandment Bonds fell again by 1.75 yuan, creating a new low price. Thursday was the busiest day of trading. Transactions were only made in three sessions. After the first session continued to fall sharply, the financial community rose up to support the market, and the market price actually rebounded by 3 jiao to 1 yuan. The news on Friday was relatively dull. The financial community continued to buy, and the rise was very strong. Numbers 11, 45, and 48 were buying very heavily. In the end, the situation between Britain and Italy caused a drop of about 1 yuan, but it still rose by 2 jiao to 7 or 8 jiao. On Saturday, there were still many rumors, and prices were quite different, about 3 to 4 jiao. Looking at the overall situation for the week, Number 16 was selling every day, and Number 48 was also mostly buying. Both sides were adding to their positions. The northern gangs sold first and then bought, and retail investors also sold more and bought less. Settlement was approaching, and the accounts were still large. Changes were coming, and the momentum was growing. The market price results for the week all declined, from 1.2 jiao to 1.15 jiao. The trading volume on Thursday was the smallest. The total trading volume was 12,719,100 yuan. The rise and fall results are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened. Although the news from Liverpool was good, due to the large-scale selling by the South, the European situation was smooth, and the bulls closed their positions. The prices for each month fell by 1 to 4 pounds. The needs of the industry are currently calmer at the current market price. Although there is still progress in foreign merchants' purchases, the wheat market was weak afterwards, and selling resumed, and the market price continued to soften. Some merchants firmly believe that the movement of new cotton has reached its peak. The cotton demand is slightly sluggish, and the closing price is flat and weak. It is estimated that the spot price fell by 5 pounds, and the futures price fell by 3 to 12 pounds. The spot price of British cotton rose by 8 points, and the futures price rose by 5 points. Indian cotton speculators bought and sold short, and the bulls profited from closing their positions. It is estimated that Pingguoer rose by 0.75 rupees, Aomura rose by 1 rupee, and Bailuoxi rose by 1.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram on the 19th).</p>

In the women's group, Shandong and Shanxi were tied for third place overall. Yesterday's final men's and women's swimming championships were swept by Guangdong, and two new swimming records were created.

<h3 id="e163">The Grand Occasion of the Closing Award Ceremony Telegrams of Condolence to Chairman Chiang Express Men's and Women's Championships Awarded Separately <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The sixth National Games, which opened on National Day, has concluded all competitions. The closing ceremony of the conference was held after the completion of the international competition yesterday. At 5 pm, under the enthusiastic mood of 150,000 Chinese and foreign spectators, the ceremony was simple and grand. The closing speech was given by the President of the Conference, Mr. Wang Shijie, and awards were given by President Sun and Minister Kong respectively. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Telegrams of Condolence to Chairman Chiang</p>
<p>When the conference held the closing ceremony yesterday, it sent a telegram of condolence to Chairman Chiang of the Military Commission of the National Government in Nanjing, which read: "Chairman Chiang, Military Commission of the National Government in Nanjing, has been disturbed by the Red bandits for many years, and the country has been troubled many times, which has been extremely difficult. You, General Leader of the Division, commanded with determination, supervised the division in Jiangxi, went straight to the lair, drove north, gathered and annihilated Sichuan and Yunnan, held hair and vomited, worked hard and made great contributions, and all my compatriots admired it. The National Games were held in Shanghai, lasting more than ten days, with nearly 3,000 athletes from home and abroad, and more than one million spectators. Looking up to virtue and majesty, and yearning for demeanor, only you are diligent and worried, and have not been able to fulfill your wishes. Now, on the day of the closing ceremony of the conference, everyone unanimously sent a telegram to express their admiration and condolences. Please inspect it, Wang Shijie, Chairman of the Sixth National Games, Wu Tiecheng, Vice Chairman, and all unit general representatives, general team leaders, athletes, and all conference staff."</p>
<p>More Than 100,000 People Participated</p>
<p>Honorary Vice Chairman Kong Xiangxi, Sun Ke, Preparation Director Wu Tiecheng, Committee Members Wang Zhengting, Chu Minyi, Pan Gongzhan, Lei Zhen, Ma Chonggan, Jiang Jianbai, General Secretary Shen Siliang, and Advisors Huang Shaoxiong, Luo Jialun, etc., all participated in the grand event. Yu Hongjun presided over the ceremony. At 5 o'clock, the music was played to start the conference. The flags of 38 units were brought into the venue by the Boy Scouts and arranged in front of the West Command Platform. Behind them were the athletes of each unit, but most of them had left the conference, so there were only hundreds of athletes from Wei, Hai, Kang, Ha, Re, Hei, Ji, Liao, Ma, Gan, Hu, Yu, Ji, Jin, and other provinces. Various championship awards were displayed in front of the venue, dazzling and eye-catching.</p>
<p>President Wang's Closing Speech</p>
<p>After the ceremony, the Chairman of the Conference, Wang Shijie, delivered a closing speech, roughly saying: "Today is the last day of the National Games. Over the past ten days, representatives from various provinces and cities have competed in accordance with various procedures, which is very good. I believe that you all understand the main points of sports. There are three things I want to say today: (1) Maintain sportsmanship and athlete morality. Sports have educational significance and should be based on this purpose to seek the development of intelligence and moral education at the same time. (2) Encourage women's sports. In the past, our country did not pay attention to women's sports, but now it is gradually promoting it and the results are gradually appearing. I still hope that all representatives will continue to work hard. (3) The duration of this conference is longer than in previous years, and all facilities are quite perfect. This is enough to show progress, and the hard work of all preparation staff and all preparation committees should be deeply thanked. I wish you all a safe journey and continue to work hard in the sports industry to promote the physique of our nation." Chairman Chiang of the Military Commission is very concerned about this conference. Because Chairman Chiang is stationed in Sichuan to suppress bandits and has made meritorious service to the country, he specially sent a telegram of condolence, which was applauded and approved by the whole audience.</p>
<p>Awards Given for Championships</p>
<p>After the speech, the awards were given. The first prize for the men's and women's overall championship was Shanghai, awarded by President Sun. The first prize was Guangdong, awarded by Minister Wang. The third prize was Hong Kong, awarded by Dr. Wang Zhengting. The fourth prize was Malaya, awarded by Mayor Wu. The first prize for the women's overall championship was Shanghai, awarded by Vice President Kong. The second prize was Guangdong, awarded by Huang Shaoxiong. The third prize was Shandong and Shanxi, awarded by Secretary-General Chu. Other prizes will be collected at 10 am today.</p>
<p>Lowering the Conference Flag and Great Cheers</p>
<p>The conference flag was slowly lowered amidst the music. Then, Preparation Director Wu Tiecheng presented it to Minister of Education Wang Shijie for safekeeping. Thus, the sixth National Games, which mobilized hundreds of thousands of people for eleven days, came to an end. It was already dusk, and the lights were shining brightly. Athletes from various places left the venue one after another, and tens of thousands of spectators dispersed and returned.</p>

<p>Score Correction The conference announced that Shanghai only scored 26 points, but it was found that one point of swimming in the fourth place was mistakenly included in Guangxi, so this newspaper cancelled one point of Guangxi and added it to Shanghai. Ma Hua should have received at least one and a half points for tennis, but the conference only gave one point, so it was also corrected. The reason is detailed separately. The conference announced that Ma Hua only scored ten points, the same as Hong Kong, but because Hong Kong had more championships than Ma Hua, Ma Hua was listed as fourth.</p>
<p>Women's Overall Championship Scoring</p>
<p>Overall Championship Shanghai 16 points</p>
<p>Overall Second Guangdong 14 points</p>
<p>Overall Third Shandong 4 points</p>
<p>Overall Third Shanxi 4 points</p>
<p>(Note) Shandong and Shanxi each scored four points, and it was impossible to determine the high and low scores, so they were tied for third place.</p>
<p>Score Correction The conference announced that Malaya also scored four points, but according to this newspaper's calculation, it only had three points, because one point of tennis should be given to Sichuan. The reason is detailed separately.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Conference Ticket Revenue Approximately 110,000 Yuan <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Budget Only 50,000</p>
<p>The conference held the opening ceremony on the 10th of this month, and 10,000 people attended, and 16,000 yuan of tickets were sold. In the following days, the number of people was not large, and only 2,000 to 3,000 yuan were sold per day. When swimming and football started, the number of spectators suddenly increased, and the daily ticket revenue was more than 10,000 yuan. Yesterday was the closing ceremony, with China-West football matches, and there were still many visitors, and more than 13,000 yuan of tickets were sold. It is said that the ticket money entrusted by the conference to the city bank and China Travel Service has not been completely paid. Last night, the conference calculated the ticket revenue to be about 110,000 yuan, more than twice the ticket budget of 50,000 yuan.</p>

<p>According to the total championship scoring table issued by the organizing committee, in men's tennis, Sichuan was third and Malaya was fourth. However, based on the verified match results, Malaya won third place in doubles, and Sichuan won two fourth places in singles and doubles. Therefore, in the championship rankings, Malaya should be ranked third and Sichuan fourth. However, the organizing committee's announcement was exactly the opposite. At the very least, the two teams should be tied for third, with each receiving one and a half points. If this were the case, Malaya would be third in the overall championship standings with ten and a half points, and Hong Kong would be fourth with ten points. Now, Malaya is ranked fourth in tennis, which affects its overall championship ranking. The difference is slight, but the impact is significant. This is the first point that the organizing committee should pay attention to.</p>
<p>In women's tennis, Shanxi is undoubtedly first and Shanghai second. Nanjing won third and fourth place in singles, ranking third, which is also not a problem. Sichuan won third place in doubles and should be ranked fourth in the tennis championship. Although Malaya won fourth place in doubles, it was not enough to be ranked. However, in the total championship scoring table released by the organizing committee, Sichuan has no points, while Malaya is ranked fourth with one point, which is unknown on what basis. This is the second point that the organizing committee should pay attention to. In this competition, there was a previous error in the reversed rankings of sixth and seventh place in five sports. Because no one protested, it was glossed over. Fortunately, it was unrelated to the championship rankings and was a minor matter. Now, the difference in tennis scores is slight, but it is directly related to the championship rankings, which is extremely important. The organizing committee should carefully verify and announce the results based on the achievements to demonstrate credibility. This newspaper has already made corrections on their behalf and re-prints the situation of the men's and women's tennis championships as reported in yesterday's newspaper for reference.</p>

<p>Yesterday's swimming competition, still began at 1:00 PM, with only three events, namely the men's 200-meter relay final, the men's 1500-meter freestyle final, and the women's 200-meter relay final. With that, all the swimming competitions came to an end. The Guangdong men's and women's teams scored the most points and each took home the championship trophy. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Men's 200 Relay  The men's 200-meter relay final saw Shandong, Hebei, and Qingdao withdraw, so only eight teams from Pingma, Jiangxi, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Shanghai, and Hong Kong participated. Each team had four members.  At the sound of the gun, Hong Kong and Guangdong took the lead, neck and neck.  Until the very last leg, Hong Kong was slightly ahead of Guangdong, reaching the finish line in 2 minutes and 1 second and 2 tenths.  But Guangdong also reached the finish line in 2 minutes and 1 second and 4 tenths, a difference of only two tenths of a second.  Third was Malaya, fourth Shanghai, fifth Fujian, and sixth Guangxi.</p>
<p>Men's 1500 The men's 1500-meter freestyle final was truly one of the most intense scenes. There were eight participants. When they first entered the pool, Shanghai's Shi Bogen and Malaya's Yang Weimo took the lead. Before they had gone ten laps, Shi gradually fell behind. Hong Kong's Chen Zhennan, amidst thunderous applause, was able to keep pace with Yang Weimo. At this time, Guangdong's Mai Weiming, Guangxi's Huang Jinghuan, and Hong Kong's Chen Zhenxing were also neck and neck. By the 18th lap, Chen Zhenxing suddenly felt weak and uncomfortable and stopped swimming midway. Fujian's Hong Xun also stopped soon after. At this time, only six people continued swimming, and they all had the hope of winning a prize, so they all put in extra effort and moved forward vigorously. By the 25th lap, Yang Weimo even leaped ahead. Hong Kong's Chen Xiaonan was unwilling to show weakness and tried his best to catch up. Yang and Chen were already more than two laps ahead of the others. As a result, Yang was ultimately the better, and when Yang reached the finish line, Chen was still 20 meters away. Yang came first and Chen second, but their scores were 22 minutes and 59 seconds and 2 tenths, and 23 minutes 23 seconds and 1 tenth, both breaking the national record. Guangxi's Lei Bingchang, although ranked last, was not far from the fifth place. Fujian's Lei, at only fourteen years old, is truly a force to be reckoned with.</p>
<p>Women's 200 Relay The women's 200-meter relay final was the grand finale. Originally, there were five teams from Guangdong, Malaya, Fujian, Guangxi, and Hong Kong, but only three teams from Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Guangxi participated. The Hong Kong team had the Yang sisters, so they were most confident of winning the championship. Guangdong's Liu Guizhen, Chen Huanqiong, and others were also strong competitors and were unwilling to fall behind. After Hong Kong, Guangdong's Liang Yuzhen took the lead all the way, with Hong Kong's Chen Yuhui following behind. In the second leg, there was no difference between Guangdong and Hong Kong. In the third leg, Guangdong's young general Weng Huanqiong's swimming was slow, which was the main reason why Hong Kong later finished in second place. In the fourth leg, Guangdong's Liu Guizhen entered the water. When Hong Kong's Yang Xiuqiong entered the race, Yang Chong started sprinting with full force, but at the finish line, she was still about two meters short, finishing second. Third was Guangxi. The score for first place was Guangdong, 2 minutes 39 seconds and 2 tenths, breaking the national and Far Eastern records. Second place Hong Kong, 2 minutes 42 seconds and 7 tenths, also broke the national record. Third place Guangxi, 2 minutes 49 seconds, tying the national record.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Fundraising Association for Flood Relief in Various Provinces, in order to raise relief funds, sent a letter to the National Games requesting that a disaster relief competition be held. The original letter stated, "In reply, this association previously sent a letter to your association regarding the severe floods in various provinces and the urgent need for relief, requesting that the games be extended by three days, and the proceeds from ticket sales be used for disaster relief. We have now received a reply stating that the games are limited by expenses and restricted by the articles of association, making it difficult to extend the games. These are indeed real circumstances. However, fundraising for disaster relief relies on collecting small amounts to make a large sum. In addition, the weather is getting colder, and the need for funds is extremely urgent. Therefore, we once again plead on behalf of the disaster victims, hoping that you will consider the tragic situation in the disaster areas and, within the realm of possibility, select a few events that are of interest to all sectors, such as a football match, to help with disaster relief, in order to provide relief. We will be deeply grateful and hope to hear from you soon. To Mr. Wu, President of the Sixth National Games, and Vice President, from the Shanghai Fundraising Association for Flood Relief in Various Provinces."</p>

<p>—51.6 Seconds—</p>
<p>Li Shiming Also Sets New Record in 800 Meters, Chinese Team Ties National Record in 400 Meter Relay</p>
<p>Yesterday's Sino-Western track and field competition was a contest between the outstanding athletes from this National Games and the Western expatriates in Shanghai. The Western athletes were a combined team from England, America, and Russia. As a result of yesterday's competition, the Chinese team won nine of the ten events. Except for the discus, where Guo Jie and Leng Peigen were absent and lost, the rest of the championships belonged to the Chinese. The full results are recorded below:</p>

<p>Dai Shuguo's Achievement is Commendable</p>
<p>Among yesterday's competitions, the most commendable was Dai Shuguo's 400 meters. Dai was the champion of the 400 meters in this National Games and set a new national record with 52.2 seconds. In yesterday's 400-meter race, Dai started very fast. Between 200 meters and 300 meters, he competed fiercely with the Westerner Like Kaonaf, with excellent speed. It seemed that he still had energy to spare after finishing the race. This was probably a major reason why Dai set a national record yesterday. Dai set a national record with 51.6 seconds, which can be said to be unprecedented. This record will be recognized as the national highhest record for 400 meters this year.</p>
<p>Liu Changchun Amazes the Audience</p>
<p>Liu Changchun won two championships in the 100-meter and 200-meter races, and the results of both were quite satisfying. In the first event, the 100-meter final, Liu Changchun led from start to finish, showing very strong strength. He is truly worthy of being the only short-distance prodigy in our country. Less than ten minutes after the 100-meter race, the 200-meter race began. Liu led all the way, throwing off second place Dai Shuguo by a large margin. The audience was amazed. The 100-meter and 200-meter races were both held against the wind, and the results were 11 seconds for the 100 meters and 22.3 seconds for the 200 meters. In particular, the result of the 200 meters was very close to the national record.</p>
<p>Hao Chunde Wins Two Championships</p>
<p>The veteran Hao Chunde, in this National Games, was like a dragon trapped on the beach. Due to eligibility issues, he was unable to compete. In yesterday's Games, he was finally able to show his skills. In the javelin throw, he won the championship with 49.129 meters, overwhelming Peng Yongxin, the champion of the National Games. Hao also won the championship in the long jump with a result of 6.63 meters, surpassing Ye Sui'an, the long jump champion of the National Games. In fact, Hao defeated two champions of this National Games yesterday. Mr. Hao is old, but his prestige still remains.</p>
<p>Li Shiming Loses One, Gains One</p>
<p>Li Shiming broke the national record in the 800 meters with 2 minutes and 4.2 seconds, but his result was not as good as the 2 minutes and 2.1 seconds of the champion of this National Games. Also, Li was the scorer in the javelin throw in this Games. Li's javelin throw yesterday was 47.815 meters, but it was not listed. It can be said that he lost one and gained one.</p>
<p>Many Famous Generals Return</p>
<p>In yesterday's discus final, we were missing two great generals, one was the champion of this year, Guo Jie, who returned to his hometown of Dalian the day before yesterday, and the other was the runner-up, Leng Peigen, who had already returned to Beijing. It was also rumored that Jin Cheng did not appear in the 100-meter and 200-meter races because he went to Hangzhou for sightseeing. Jia Yunren also gave up the 800-meter and 1500-meter races, reportedly due to poor health. Also, Wu Bixian, who once scored points in the high jump, was disqualified by the organizing committee this time. Although the organizing committee invited Mr. Wu to attend yesterday, Mr. Wu had actually returned to Tianjin four or five days ago. Yu Qingrong, who also did high jump, also returned home.</p>
<p>Detailed Description of the Competition</p>
<p>100</p>
<p>The first shot was fired, but the Westerners were recalled for a false start. When the second shot sounded, Liu Changchun started as agile as in the finals of the Games, followed by Zhao Bingheng. Liu led all the way and was two meters ahead of Zhao at 50 meters. He beat second place Ye Haitao by five meters at the finish. Ye and Zhao competed fiercely at 50 meters, and as a result, Ye finally surpassed and won second place.</p>
<p>200</p>
<p>The 200 meters was held immediately after the 100 meters. Liu Changchun did not run the 200 meters in the National Games, so this time he was determined to give it his all. Liu is highly respected in the sprint community in our country. For seven or eight years, no one has been able to break his records. Yesterday, in the 200 meters, Mr. Liu showed his strength, proving that Liu's reputation is well-deserved.</p>
<p>400</p>
<p>In the 400-meter race, only Li Yanxiang and Dai Shuguo from the Chinese team participated. Dai started the fastest. Between 200 meters and 300 meters, he competed fiercely with the Westerner Like Kaonu, but Dai ran faster and faster, and Li Yanxiang soon surpassed the two Westerners Fang Sake and Like Kaonu. At the finish, Dai beat second-place Li Yanxiang by about ten meters.</p>
<p>800</p>
<p>Jia Lianren did not appear in the 800 meters, and there was a lack of competition. Li Shiming remained in first place throughout, followed by Qiu Sicheng, followed by the three Westerners. Li Shiming ran casually and did not exert much effort from start to finish, rushing straight for the finish line, with a result of 2 minutes and 4.2 seconds, breaking the national record. Qiu Zhongcheng did not exert himself in the 800 meters and comfortably got second place, because he was still preparing to score points in the 1500 meters.</p>
<p>1500</p>
<p>Wang Zhenglin has recently tended to switch to middle-distance running, and the 1500 meters has become his forte. Wang Zhenglin started with a bold and unrestrained style, running with his familiar speed regardless of everything, leading all the way. The second place was the two Westerners, and Qiu was in fourth place. Wang Zhenglin ran faster and faster, and no one competed with him. Qiu was in last place, but he was confident and entered second place in the last 300 meters.</p>
<p>Long Jump</p>
<p>There were three great generals attending the long jump, namely Ye Sui'an, Zhang Jia夔, and Hao Chunde. Ye and Zhang's past results had all reached 7 meters, while the old Hao was the holder of the national record. None of the three Westerners who participated were worth mentioning. In the first week of trial jumps, there were no special performances. Hao got 6.63 meters on the fourth run, and Ye jumped 6.57 meters on the third jump. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Hao Chunde (China) 6.63 meters</p>
<p>(2) Ye Sui'an (China) 6.57 meters</p>
<p>(3) Zhang Jia夔 (China) 6.41 meters</p>
<p>(4) Watt (West) 6.15 meters</p>
<p>High Jump</p>
<p>In the high jump final, Liu Mingru and Qiu Guang爕 represented our country. Unfortunately, Wu Bixian and Yu Qingrong had already returned home and were unable to show their skills. All the athletes who participated yesterday jumped over 1.66 meters. Raised to 1.71 meters, Liu Mingru, Anteson, Gu Xinla, and Qiu Guang爕 all jumped over it. Raised to 1.74 meters, only Liu jumped over it. The remaining three failed to pass it. After several raises and lowers, the rankings of one, three, one and four were determined. It was then increased to 1.78 meters, but Liu failed to jump over it, so he stopped.</p>
<p>(1) Liu Mingru (China) 1.74 meters</p>
<p>(2) Anteson (West) 1.71 meters</p>
<p>(3) Qiu Guang爕 (China) 1.71 meters</p>
<p>(4) Gu Xinla (China) 1.71 meters</p>
<p>Discus</p>
<p>Leng Zenggen and Guo Jie were absent, and only Zhang Linghua from our country participated. Zhang fought alone and won the runner-up with 36.685 meters. The difference from the first-place Lai Fuxiang was extremely close. If Guo and Leng were here, then the championship would never have fallen into the hands of foreigners.</p>
<p>(1) Lai Gaofu (West) 36.89 meters</p>
<p>(2) Zhang Lingjia (China) 36.685 meters</p>
<p>(3) Qufu Min Gao (West) 3x meters 30</p>
<p>(4) Jia Zhang (China) 34.495 meters</p>
<p>Javelin</p>
<p>After throwing it back and forth, Peng Yongsheng was in first place. By the fifth and sixth throws, the situation changed drastically. In the fifth throw, Ao Huaming got 48.65 meters, overwhelming the crowd. The Westerner Ke Qing also made a shocking performance in the fifth throw, getting 48.87 meters and jumping to first place. Peng Yongxin tried to win it, but his wish went against his heart. Fortunately, veteran Hao Chunde made the final decision with the last throw, getting 49.25 meters and winning the championship, and the national army was spared humiliation.</p>
<p>(1) Hao Chunde (China) 49.25 meters</p>
<p>(2) Ke Qing (West) 48.87 meters</p>
<p>(3) Ao Huaming (China) 48.65 meters</p>
<p>(4) Xing Yongxin (China) 48.595 meters</p>
<p>Relay</p>
<p>The last event was the 400 relay. The participants were two teams, Chinese and Western, with four people on each team. The Chinese team had Ye Songping running the first leg, Zhang Kan running the second leg, Zhao Bingheng running the third leg, and Chen Yongfu running the fourth leg. The Chinese team led from the start, and the batons were passed smoothly, making victory not difficult. The result was 44.4 seconds. The lists of the two teams are as follows:</p>

<p>Defeated Nanjing's Huang Shannong 2-1</p>
<p>The battle for the runner-up in women's tennis singles was held at 9:00 AM yesterday morning. Shanghai's Wei Maigu relied on her steady hitting skills, fought fiercely for three sets, and barely won 2-1. Huang was good at attacking, and Wei was good at defending. It was a pity that Huang made too many unforced errors and was defeated by Wei's soft approach. In the first set, Wei's momentum was strong, and she took the lead, winning three games in a row. Huang was also unwilling to be outdone and responded in kind, and each tied at four games. Wei continued her efforts and used the trick of feinting to the east and attacking in the west to exhaust the opponent, adding two games to win the first set 6-4. In the second set, Huang was still not in good shape and fell behind 4-2. At this time, the situation changed, and Huang suddenly cheered up, attacking rapidly with backhand and forehand strokes, and moving freely left, right, front, and back. Wei, on the other hand, ran around defending and was unable to serve. Huang won three consecutive rounds and took the lead 5-4. Next, when Huang served, she initially had the advantage with 40 to 15, but then her old problems recurred and she repeatedly made mistakes, creating a tie. But Huang was not discouraged and continued to work hard. Sure enough, where there is a will, there is a way, and she won two consecutive games to win back a set 7-5, forming a tie. The third set was decisive, but Huang had used too much energy in the previous set and was exhausted. Wei, on the other hand, was shining brightly and full of momentum, winning five games in a row in one go. Although Huang bravely resisted and won back three games, the overall situation was gone, and it was impossible to turn the tide. Wei finally won the final victory 6-3, ranking runner-up, and Huang ranked third.</p>

<p>Depart by night train tomorrow</p>
<p>To be held afternoon of the day after</p>
<p>Luo Jialun, a member of the Central Committee, first initiated an invitation for the National Games soccer team to go to Beijing for a disaster relief match, hosted by the Lizhi Society. Mayor Wu greatly approved of this idea and specially contacted Yan Chengkun, Honorary Advisor of the Games and Head of the Hong Kong Delegation, requesting that the team hold disaster relief matches in Nanjing and Shanghai after the Games' closing, allocating the proceeds to disaster areas in various regions. Mr. Yan, caring for the motherland and enthusiastic about public welfare, agreed to the request and decided to hold the match on the 23rd at the Nanjing Mausoleum Stadium and perform in Shanghai on the 26th. It is said that the team is scheduled to leave for Beijing by night train on the 22nd. After the match on the 23rd, they will return to Shanghai immediately. After playing again on the 26th, they will wait for the ship to return to Hong Kong. The team will be composed of players from Beijing and Shanghai. The expenses for the trip to Beijing and other receptions have been decided to be borne by Beijing. According to Mr. Yan's statement to the Central News Agency reporter, except for goalkeeper Bao Jiaping, who has to return to Hong Kong due to work reasons, the remaining fourteen members, including Li Huitang and Cao Guicheng, will all participate in the Beijing and Shanghai disaster relief soccer games, preparing to attract the audience's interest with the most exquisite soccer skills, in order to increase revenue. Guangdong's Tan Jiangbai and Yang Shuiyi, two strong players, also decided to travel together due to emotional reasons. The list of the Hong Kong team is as follows: Li Huitang, Tan Jiangbai, Liang Rongzhao, Huang Meishun, Li Guowei, Cao Guicheng, Yang Shuiyi, Zheng Liliang, Li Zhaorong, Zhuo Shijin, Li Shuoyou, Liang Xianzhan, Yang Benhan, Yu Qingyuan, Huang Huaji, He Jiaqi,</p>
<h3 id="e179">Sino-Foreign Football Exhibition Match: China United and Western United Fail to Score, Ending in a Lackluster 0-0 Draw; Absence of "King of Football" Leaves Forwards Helpless in Front of Goal <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday at 3:00 PM, the China United team, a mix of winning teams from the All-China Games football tournament, played against the Western United team, a mix of the strongest foreign football players in Shanghai. Our side was weakened significantly due to injuries to "King of Football" Li Huitang (arm), goalkeeper Bao Jiaping (back), and the absence of key players Xu Yahui, Chen Zhenhe, Sun Jinshun, and Zhu Jianjiang. The China United team was based primarily on players from Hong Kong and Malaya, with only Tan Jiangbai from Guangdong added. However, Tan's heading ability saved many dangerous situations. Western United's left and right wings were very active, and their defense was solid. The game ended in a 0-0 draw. The exhibition lacked tension and excitement. Although the China United forwards' passing was excellent, they lacked shooting ability. Cao Guicheng missed the most opportunities, wasting his efforts. If the "King of Football" had been on the field, victory would have been effortless.</p>
<p>Mayor Kicks Off</p>
<p>Yesterday at 3:20 PM, the game began with Mayor Wu kicking off. Cao Guicheng intercepted the ball and launched an attack toward the enemy camp. Two foreign defenders rushed to stop him, and Cao, in his eagerness, dribbled the ball out of bounds. Shortly after, center forward Xie Qingfu led a fierce attack, taking a long shot from 30 yards out, but the ball sailed over the goal. At the same time, foreign wingers Walter and Willie attacked from the left and right, but their shots were also ineffective.</p>
<p>Goalpost Obstructs</p>
<p>For the next 15 minutes, Western United launched an all-out attack with great intensity, constantly bombarding the goal. Fortunately, Huang Jinbai was experienced and composed, blocking the ball with hands and feet, not yielding an inch. The time passed back and forth until the 30th minute when our left inside forward, Li Zhaorong, received a brilliant pass from Cao Guicheng, dribbled past the final line of defense, and took a powerful shot at the goal. Unfortunately, the ball hit the goalpost with a loud thud and rebounded. Cao Guicheng intercepted the rebound but also missed. The foreign players cheered, while our team was dejected. At that moment, the whistle blew, ending the first half with a scoreless tie.</p>
<p>Following Suit</p>
<p>After the break, the teams switched sides and the Chinese team launched a fierce attack, dominating the enemy camp for over ten minutes. There were at least seven or eight scoring opportunities, but our forwards lacked precision and power. In addition, the experienced foreign goalkeeper was well-trained, resulting in wasted effort. The entire crowd sighed. In the 14th minute, our right inside forward, Yao Shenghua, fiercely dribbled the ball past defenders, employing a feint. The two foreign defenders thought Yao would pass to the right winger and rushed to intercept, but Yao seized the opportunity to kick the ball powerfully at the goal. The ball flew like a bullet, but again was blocked by the goalpost, following suit and bouncing back into our territory. It was both regrettable and infuriating.</p>
<p>Devoid of Excitement</p>
<p>Soon, the momentum shifted, and our side was under pressure again. The Western United forwards moved freely, with the left and right wings charging like a broken dam. Fortunately, Tan Jiangbai repeatedly showcased his heading skills, earning applause from the entire crowd. Otherwise, losing a goal at that crucial moment would have sealed our fate and been impossible to recover from. After the 20th minute, the game became chaotic, with high balls flying back and forth. The game became loose, lacking excitement. Finally, the game ended with the score still 0-0, demonstrating the spirit of friendship. The entire crowd smiled and quietly observed the closing ceremony.</p>

<p>After the international men's basketball match, the Sino-foreign women's teams took to the court. The Chinese team was the Shanghai Women's Basketball Team, champions of the All-China Games, also known as the Liangjiang Women's Basketball Team. Western United was based on the formidable Green Team, with additional outstanding players from other teams. Yesterday's game was almost entirely dominated by the Chinese team, with Western United hardly able to resist. The Liangjiang team had been defeated by the Green Team in last year's Western Youth Women's Basketball Tournament, demonstrating the team's significant improvement. However, Western United used men's rules, employing a six-player, two-zone system, which may have contributed to their defeat. After the center jump, Chen Jucai scored two consecutive baskets within a minute, and Bai Naite also scored two points. Chen Rongming dominated the court, and the enemy's basket was repeatedly threatened. Chinese fans smiled with joy, while the blonde-haired foreign players sighed. The first quarter ended 11-5, giving the foreign ladies a warning. In the second quarter, Pan Meng scored, and Rongming scored again. Western United only scored one point from a free throw by Basake. The first half ended with a decisive 17-6 victory for the Chinese team. After drinking lemonade, the Chinese team saw that Western United was not a strong opponent, so Chen Rongming and Jucai declared their retirement, and Wan Shunxiang and Chen Rongtang took over their roles. They were equally merciless, and Western United had no chance to retaliate. Until the last five minutes, when the Chinese team saw that victory was assured, they stopped pressing so aggressively. Western United began to rally slightly, with Rowling scoring two baskets and Bai Naite also scoring. Before time ran out, the Chinese women's team achieved a great victory.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Chinese and foreign tennis stars held a grand exhibition at the All-China Games tennis court, competing in three matches, all played in a best-of-three sets format. In the end, Carson defeated Xu Chengji 2-1 in singles, Qian Yaobin defeated Forbes 2-0, and Xu Chengji and Lin Shihua defeated Carson and Devoe 2-0 in doubles. All matches were exceptionally exciting, especially the Carson-Xu singles match. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Xu Chengji Loses to Carson</p>
<p>The Xu-Carson match began at 10:15 AM amidst thunderous applause from the audience. Xu is a national player, while Carson is the Shanghai singles champion. The two are evenly matched, and the outcome depended entirely on their performance during the match. When Xu and Carson returned to Shanghai after participating in the Davis Cup in the United States, they competed once in Shanghai, with Xu winning 2-1. However, Xu had been competing in the All-China Games for several days without rest, inevitably leading to exhaustion. After winning the first set 6-1, his energy waned, and Carson seized the opportunity to defeat him 2-1, which was a pity.</p>
<p>Full of Excitement</p>
<p>Carson's serve faltered, and Xu took advantage, gaining a 2-0 lead, seizing the initiative. Carson fought back hard, winning a game. Xu continued to press, with great momentum. His low and fast cross-court shots were precise, and Carson scrambled left and right, unable to defend effectively. Everything went smoothly, and Xu won four consecutive games, winning the first set 6-1 with ease. In the second set, he was cautious and did not dare to be careless. Each point won required considerable effort, making the match full of excitement. The applause thundered. Both players countered with low and fast cross-court shots, or used lobs to challenge their opponent. However, Carson was tall and strong, exceptionally agile. Xu showed a slight lapse, and Carson seized the opportunity to take a commanding 5-1 lead. Although Xu fought hard to regain a game, Carson won 6-2, tying the match at one set apiece.</p>
<p>Missed Opportunity</p>
<p>The final set was the key to victory. The match became increasingly intense and exciting, with each player giving their all for every point. The audience watched with bated breath, completely focused. However, Xu missed opportunities at crucial moments, while Carson became increasingly courageous and ran quickly. Even when faced with the most difficult shots, he refused to give up. The outcome depended on this. At the beginning, the two sides were evenly matched, keeping pace with each other, and the score remained close, 2-2, 3-3, and then 4-4. Xu was leading the way, and in the ninth game, Xu served, immediately committing a double fault, followed by an unforced error. He lost the game. In the next game, Carson served, and Xu initially had a 40-30 lead, but his desire to win led to more unforced errors, while Carson responded carefully and calmly, winning three consecutive points and taking the set 6-4.</p>
<p>Qian Yaobin Defeats Forbes</p>
<p>The Qian Yaobin vs. Forbes match began around 11:00 AM. Forbes is the Shanghai junior singles champion, with admirable skills. Qian had defeated strong opponents in the All-China Games, and his forehand shots were sharp and fast. After the start, Forbes took the initiative, winning three consecutive games. Qian refused to be outdone and retaliated, coming from behind to lead 4-3. Forbes tried again, tying the score at 4-4. Qian rallied and won two more games, winning the first set 6-4. In the second set, Qian became even more dominant, hitting high and low shots at will. Forbes collapsed and struggled to defend, only winning one game in the entire set, losing 6-1.</p>
<p>Lin and Xu Pair Well in Doubles</p>
<p>Xu and Lin paired for the first time to face Carson and Devoe, who were considered invincible in Shanghai. After a dramatic two-set match, they won with a very close score, which was no easy feat. Overall, Lin Baohua was the most outstanding performer. Xu, exhausted from the singles match and in a poor mood, inevitably showed signs of fatigue while facing strong opponents. Although he occasionally made excellent plays, he was not as energetic as Lin in the overall match. Carson and Devoe were similar in style, and their ability to save difficult shots was amazing. Devoe's overhead smash sometimes had unpredictable landing points, but he also made many mistakes, unlike Carson, who was more steady.</p>
<p>First Set</p>
<p>Xu started serving, and Lin Baohua's three delicate and beautiful volleys at the net won the first game. After that, Xu and Lin frequently used high-pressure skills, quickly taking a 4-0 lead. Carson and Devoe pulled back two games, but Xu and Lin also won, making it 5-2. Carson and Devoe fought desperately, rushing to save even the most difficult balls. Once, Carson fell into the crowd sitting on the edge of the court while saving a ball, showing his effort. Therefore, they finally caught up with three games, making it 5-5. They then exceeded with 6-5. Xu and Lin responded cautiously and also won two games, leading again 7-6. Carson and Devoe also created a 7-7 tie. Xu and Lin cheered up, hitting two baseline cross-court shots and winning the game 9-7.</p>
<p>Second Set</p>
<p>Carson and Devoe took the first three games with an extraordinary momentum. The audience worried about Xu and Lin, but Xu and Lin were not weak. With a similar burst, they formed three games creating equilibrium. Then go to 4-3 exceeded. Devoe's serve failed, and again to equal. Xu and Carson serve are winning into 5-5, Lin and Xu hard to deal with one and again save the dangerous ball. Devoe high pressure and the self-destructive net lost a game. Xu and Lin came to be, winning the forest with 7-5, Xu and Lin Kai triumph</p>

<p>After the All-China Games basketball championship concluded, the organizing committee, in order to test the performance of the athletes, specially invited a strong Western team for a Sino-foreign competition. The Western team that appeared yesterday was the All-American team composed of strong players such as Sea Bandit McLaughlin. On the Chinese side, the Hebei team, which won the championship, should have participated, but because the Hebei team did not receive prior notice, it was not easy to temporarily assemble the team, so the Nanjing and Philippine teams took turns participating. Yesterday, the Nanjing team changed its previous slow state, and the speed of passing and the accuracy of the passes were never seen in the All-China Games. Little Tang's performance was especially</p>
<p>Extraordinary</p>
<p>The tall and strong Westerners could not do anything to him. Li Zhenzhong's feet were very humid, and he withdrew to watch from the sidelines after only a few minutes on the court. Others, such as Wang Shixuan and Zhao Zhihua, also played with style. If they could have worked so hard the day before, the championship would not have been won by Hebei. The skills of the Philippine team had already been praised by all circles, but unfortunately they encountered the strong and sharp Nanjing team in the second game, which led to their elimination. Otherwise, they could have at least won the right to the rematch. Watching their yesterday against the All-American Team</p>

Half of the team was still Shu Hong from yesterday's final. The first to fight for China was the Nanjing team. After the jump ball, after three or five passes, American soldier Mo Fei fouled,</p>
<p>Baokun Scores First</p>
<p>One point, Li Zhen chased after the steps, and reached into the basket, Mo Fei turned the effort into compensation, and skillfully hit a ball, Jones was superior, and won two points, After the battle to seven on seven, the Philippine overseas Chinese army boarded the ship, like a tiger coming out of the cage, Ma Wen twisted a hundred steps through Yang, Yang Shufang sent charcoal in the snow, resulting in thirteen on nine, the American military urgently sought a truce and planned a strategy to deal with the situation, the momentum changed from then on, the two sides fought to nineteen points, Later, Boris rested</p>

<h3 id="e186">Second Exhibition Match of Little Football: Hong Kong and Shanghai Tie <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Result: 3-3</p>
<p>The exhibition match of little football between Hong Kong and Shanghai began at 10:00 AM on the 2nd, refereed by Shu Zhongguang. Both teams were full of talent and had similar strengths. Before the match started, the stands around the small football field were packed with people, estimated to be over ten thousand, the largest crowd seen for a little football match. The atmosphere was exceptionally tense. At 10:00 AM sharp, referee Shu entered the field and declared the start of the match. The two sides then formally engaged, fighting fiercely for an hour, resulting in a tie. The intensity of the match was self-evident. The details of the battle are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>First Half: 2-2</p>
<p>After the kickoff, the Hong Kong team launched a desperate offensive, hoping to score a quick goal. Shanghai's Li Yichen, seeing this, joined forces with Gan Bonan to defend, further ordering the Jia brothers to strengthen the border defenses to resist the enemy. Hong Kong's Huang Huaji then secretly used a clever tactic, attacking when the enemy was unprepared. The entire field was covered as he led the army to attack. He Jiaqiang passed to Shi Chuan, who relayed it to Li Shiyou. Yang Benhan headed the ball, approaching the enemy's goal. Amidst the chaos of the Shanghai team, Li Shiyou rushed forward and kicked the ball, which went into the net, opening the scoring. Jia Youliang, filled with anger, penetrated deep into the enemy lines, charging through the siege, and shot powerfully from the right sideline. Amidst shouts from the crowd, he scored a goal, leveling the score. Hong Kong's Yang Benhan wanted to strike first, so he raised his troops and passed the ball horizontally. When it reached the defensive line, Yang launched a powerful long shot, and the ball went into the goal again. Hong Kong took the lead with a score of 2-1. Jia Youliang then joined Wan Xianghua and Xu Wenkui to pass the ball diagonally forward, and the army advanced step by step until they reached the twelve-yard box. Jia Youliang, seeing a chance to score, calmly and steadily created a goal, making it 2-2, another tie.</p>
<p>Second Half: 1-1</p>
<p>After the lemon break, the two sides fell into a mixed battle again, each fighting for the ball. Both were too anxious, and for a quarter of an hour, there was no winner. Li Yichen jumped out from behind. The ball landed in Hong Kong territory, and a defender committed a handball. The referee declared a penalty and the ball was kicked in, taking the lead. He Jiaqiang, seeing this situation needed to be reversed, was determined to create his own success. As a result, he often committed fouls and offsides. Soon, Zhuo Shijin crossed from the right line, and He Jiaqiang, taking advantage of being unmarked, gently shot the ball. He achieved his goal with one effort, making it 3-3. The situation was set. Therefore, Bian Fangyi sought to be the first, and was eager to desperately sandwich the merit. Within more than 20 minutes, the match was difficult to resolve. In an instant, the time was up, and the match ended in a 3-3 tie.</p>
<p>Mayor Attends to Present Awards</p>
<p>After the small football exhibition match ended, the Shanghai Small Football Association specially invited Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng to attend and present the awards. There were three teams participating in this competition, so three silver cups were prepared to be awarded to the Hubei, Hong Kong, and Shanghai teams respectively, and photos were taken to commemorate the event. The lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>

<p>Encouraging Football Players</p>
<p>In this session of the Games, the football championship had four major teams competing: Hong Kong, Malaya, Guangdong, and Shanghai. Their strengths were balanced and each had their own advantages. It was truly the most exciting football tournament in the history of the Games. Our country has always held the top position in football in the Far East, and society is particularly interested in football. In the last few days, the track and field was packed, all football fans watching the games. The future development of football is limitless. This time, there were eighteen units participating in the competition. Except for Qinghai, which withdrew due to insufficient personnel, the rest all held a courageous spirit of resistance and fought to the end, which is most admirable. The teams from Hebei, Liaoning, Nanjing, Beiping, Hubei, and Qingdao had been trained for a long time, and their strength was already considerable. Others, such as Fujian, Anhui, Henan, Shandong, Jiangxi, and Hunan, had not participated in large-scale battles before, and were hastily formed. However, they emerged unexpectedly, and their skills were amazing. For example, Fujian fought Shanghai, Henan fought Nanjing, Shandong fought Guangdong, Sichuan fought Beiping, and Anhui fought Hong Kong. Facing strong enemies, they were able to fight hard and performed extremely well. The difference in scores was not something to criticize. If they are given time and training, they will become strong teams. When we meet again in the next National Games, we should look at them with new eyes after three days of separation. As for the four teams of Hong Kong, Malaya, Guangdong, and Shanghai, they are a collection of football talents in our country. The division of competitions is to increase practice, excitement, and develop experience and courage. Do not be concerned about the championship issue and stand apart. It is important to know that unity within the country can lead to resistance and victory against external forces. The World Games in Berlin next year are approaching. I sincerely hope that all football players will return and work hard, dedicating themselves to serving the country on the world football field and striving for supreme glory. Returning home with honor will be the true meaning of the training in today's National Games competition.</p>
<p>Shortcomings in Tennis</p>
<p>The advantages and disadvantages of the new system for the tennis championship have already been proven. What is the use of blaming? Everything must be successful through experimentation. Then we can use this to plan for the best possible method in the future. Therefore, today's poor system is nothing more than a new creation in the future.</p>
<p>The abolition of the Davis Cup system in this session was originally for the significance of attached grading competitions outside the team championship. Therefore, the allocation of order was like an open competition, producing both individual and team championships at the same time. The purpose was to improve domestic tennis technology and increase the interest of players, because our country has never held grading competitions. We took this opportunity to seek a win-win solution. However, because of the lack of careful planning in advance, there were shortcomings and things went wrong.</p>
<p>In the new system, doubles is no longer a problem. Singles, because there is a distinction between the first singles and the second singles, and the ranking of the first and second places is classified and arranged, is the biggest mistake. For example, if the first and second singles were mixed and arranged, this problem might not have occurred.</p>
<p>After understanding the principles, we should strive for thoroughness and become a purely open competition. After the final champion is resolved, the ranking of each player should be reviewed to determine the team to which they belong. Then, the team ranking should be judged. If so, it will not only comply with the principles of the grading competition, but the team championship will also be produced accordingly.</p>
<p>Assaulting Referees Still Occurs</p>
<p>In today's Games, athletes under certain authority often act arrogantly and cause trouble. Referees are humiliated and the organizing committee treats it lightly. Referees have become the target of their wrongdoing. The Hangzhou Games started this trend, and it has been seen again and again in Nanjing and this year's Games. Referees are beaten, and nothing is done about it. The organizing committee has no response. Those who are directly affected can only swallow their anger for the sake of face, while there is no response to the athletes who act arbitrarily. How can this arrogant atmosphere be quelled?</p>
<p>The Issue of Athletes Competing in Multiple Events</p>
<p>The competition committee of this Games decided on supplementary regulations that athletes who pre-select to compete across provinces will have their qualification for this Games cancelled. Therefore, the first to protest was Wu Bixian's qualification, and then protests continued to arise. It is not certain whether all those who protested this regulation in the Games competition regulations were based on sportsmanship, fair and upright. It is even possible that some were using it to settle scores or for revenge. In short, the law does not punish the past. The competition committee's regulations were well-intentioned, but the legislation was too late. If it is adopted in the next session, disputes can be avoided.</p>
<h3 id="e189">A Glimpse of the Traffic Situation During the National Games: The Number of Spectators and Cars is Astonishing, Setting a New Record in the History of Transportation in Our Country <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>The traffic group of the Games yesterday released a summary of the traffic situation during the Games, as follows:</p>
<p>Number of Spectators</p>
<p>During the National Games, there were five days when the number of participating spectators exceeded 100,000. The most was on National Day, with approximately 180,000 people. The second most was on October 18, with approximately 160,000 people. October 19 and 20 had no more than 150,000 people, and October 13 had only 100,000 people.</p>
<p>Traffic Order</p>
<p>During the National Games, the closing time was generally before 7:00 PM every day, except for Double Ten Day, when it suddenly rained at 4:00 PM in the afternoon, and spectators rushed to board the vehicles, causing the order to be slightly chaotic, and it was not completely cleared until 8:30 PM. For example, on October 19, although there were 150,000 spectators, the clearing was completed by 6:30 PM.</p>
<p>Car Count</p>
<p>Most of the spectators attending the National Games started arriving from 8:00 AM onwards, and many started returning to Shanghai after 3:00 PM during the three sessions. The number of vehicles traveling back and forth in one day was very large. However, due to the designated routes and other restrictions, it was not too crowded. On Double Ten Day alone, from 7:30 AM to 8:30 PM, there were approximately 12,000 vehicles traveling back and forth (detailed in the table below, empty vehicles not included). The situation on October 19 was slightly different. Because it was the football final and also a Saturday, most of the spectators went to the Games between 12:30 PM and 1:30 PM in the afternoon. During this one hour, there were 1,570 cars and 161 buses, a total of 1,731 vehicles (empty vehicles not included). When leaving, they all gathered between 5:00 PM and 9:30 PM, and were willing to leave only after the football final was completely over. Therefore, within this half hour, there were 1,460 cars and 210 buses passing through Xiangyin Road, a total of 1,670 vehicles. This can be said to be the highest record in transportation in our country.</p>
<p>Remaining Vehicles</p>
<p>As for the various vehicles used by the spectators, the number of people traveling by car was the largest, followed by buses, and then trains. For example, on Double Ten Day, there were more than 70,000 people traveling by car, approximately 60,000 people by bus (including those using cars), and approximately 10,000 people by train. Because it was National Day, all factories were closed for the day, so there were many workers participating. However, most of them walked to the meeting, and the number of pedestrians increased due to the sudden rain at 4:00 PM in the afternoon. It is estimated that the number of pedestrians on this day accounted for more than 50% of all spectators. As for other days, there were very few pedestrians. On October 19, the number of pedestrians was only about 5%.</p>

The general manager Liu Shenzhan and more than 70 athletes attended. First, Chairman Hu Weigai gave a speech, saying that there are two meanings in welcoming everyone today. First, Sichuan sent athletes to participate in the National Games, and this scale is the largest and the strength is considerable, which shows that Sichuan Province attaches great importance to sports. I hope that we can work hard to promote and popularize it in the future. Second, at this time when the national crisis is serious, every citizen should exercise and serve the country. Only with a healthy body can we have a healthy career. Everyone can pay attention to this, not only to avenge China's weakness, but the entire nation and country really depend on it, and so on. Then, Yang Cangbai, Fan Shaozeng, Li Dongfu, Feng Maoqin, and others from the Central Committee gave speeches in succession, with many words of encouragement. Liu Shenzhan, the general team leader, replied on behalf of the team, saying that he would keep in mind the instructions of the chairman and gentlemen, and would never forget them. After returning to Sichuan, he would work hard to revive the nation with all his strength, so as to live up to the expectations of all gentlemen. At that time, laughter and conversations were mixed, and the wine glasses were crossed. The host and guests dispersed happily at about 9 o'clock.</p>

<h3 id="e196">On Hunger <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>A few days ago, Changjiang, a traveling correspondent for Ta Kung Pao, wrote a travelogue about Chengdu and Lanzhou. One section recorded the death of a starving person, saying:</p>
<p>"South of Hongqiaoguan, there was a dying man lying on the side of the road, his legs bent, his lips moving from time to time. The reporter gave him a steamed bun. His hands had lost consciousness, and his eyes could not open or close freely. He repeatedly touched his hand and placed the steamed bun between his lips and nose. After a long time, he moved his hand to take the steamed bun, and after a long time, he put the steamed bun in his mouth. After he took a bite, his whole body suddenly trembled, his mouth and eyes opened wide, and he stared straight at the reporters, making a 'woo woo' sound. Only those who have personally experienced hunger can know the taste of it."</p>
<p>Written in such a light-hearted way, it rushed straight to our hearts like a cold current. In the past, Emperor Hui of Jin made a joke that has been passed down through the ages, asking why the starving people didn't eat meat. Emperor Guangxu fled to Xi'an during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, and he didn't eat for a long time on the way. He didn't know what was wrong, he just felt a stomach ache, which was the same joke. The taste of hunger cannot be known unless one has personally experienced it. The Norwegian writer Hamsun (Hamsun Knut 1860-) once wrote a novel with the theme of hunger—Hunger (written in 1888). Some sections can be compared with that correspondence:</p>
<p>"...Whenever I have endured any prolonged period of hunger, my brain seems to quietly escape from my skull, leaving me only an empty shell! My head gradually floats up, I cannot feel its weight on my shoulders, and when I look at anything, I actually open my eyes too wide." P.25</p>
<p>"...I walked lazily down the street, and at a place on Heigihajin Street, I stopped in front of a food store. There were many foods displayed in the store's window. A cat was lying there, sleeping soundly next to a round French loaf. Behind it were also a plate of lard and several plates of meat. I stood there for a while, staring at these foods, but remembering that I had no money to buy them, I suddenly turned my head and continued my wandering. ...A great confusion suddenly arose in my brain. I still staggered forward, determined not to pay attention to the confusion in my brain; but the more I walked, the worse I became, and finally I had to sit down on a step. My whole life changed. Something slipped inside me, and it seemed as if my brain net or brain face had been torn into two pieces." P.64</p>
<p>Complementing this state of hunger is a passage describing his gluttony after hunger, saying:</p>
<p>"I began to eat, eating more and more gluttonously, swallowing chunks of meat without chewing, eating each mouthful like a wild beast, and tearing the meat like a man-eating monster. ...After finishing, I immediately walked to the door; I already felt nauseous. The food began to act strangely, and I felt very uncomfortable, unable to bear it for even a moment. I had to vomit in every dark corner I passed. I struggled to suppress this nausea that would soon make me empty-bellied again; I clenched my hands, wanting to conquer it; I stomped my feet on the sidewalk, and I swallowed everything that came up. Everything was ineffective, and I finally jumped into a doorway, bent over, head forward, and the tears that burst out of my eyes blurred my eyes, and I vomited greatly. I was in terrible pain, sobbing and walking down the street." P.166</p>
<p>Hamsun writes very realistically about the physical changes of hunger. In the initial stage of hunger, it starts with the stomach, as if something is pricking in the gastrointestinal area, which is what Emperor Guangxu called a stomach ache. Furthermore, the symptoms of brain swelling and nausea occur together. When the head shakes, the eyes are full of stars. After about three to five days of hunger, in the third stage of hunger, the head is light and the feet are weak, the limbs are weak, and like a patient, one breathes constantly. Generally speaking, hunger is very painful. Hong Chengchou, a minister of the Ming Dynasty who was captured by the Qing army, prepared to starve to death to show his patriotism. After a few days of starvation, he could not support it anymore. A cup of rice juice was poured down, which induced his desire to live, and he continued to live and became a surrendered minister of the Manchu Qing. (Before Master Hongyi entered the mountains to practice, he meditated and starved for two weeks: according to him, his heart was calm and very comfortable, which can only be considered an exception.)</p>
<p>The psychological changes in hunger are much more complex than the physical changes. Hamsun said that when a person is hungry for a long time, he sees every passerby as an enemy, even if they are wearing a single shirt, he sees them as arrogant. This means that hunger arouses hatred. During the great famine in Shanxi during the Guangxu period, there was a news report that a person from another province was slaughtered and eaten by the victims. From hatred to cannibalism is also a reasonable thing to do. The early sages of Confucianism also acknowledged that ordinary people are prone to reckless behavior when they are hungry, and also acknowledged the tragic situation of people eating each other.</p>
<p>But they believed that a cultivated gentleman should show different integrity in hunger. The Book of Rites, Tan Gong, records a Qi man who fainted from hunger. Qian Ao greeted him with a compassionate tone, but he stubbornly refused to eat the "food thrown in contempt" and eventually starved to death. Although Zengzi did not approve of the Qi man's eventual starvation to death, he very much approved of the Qi man's stubborn refusal of the compassionate tone.</p>
<p>We have never seen a Confucian gentleman. The legend of Boyi and Shuqi starving to death on Shouyang Mountain is not very credible. After the Three Dynasties, we only saw an hungry poet Tao Yuanming, who was somewhat close to the Confucian ideal. After Tao Yuanming returned to the fields, his situation was generally not very good. Once, Tan Daoji, the governor of Jiangzhou, went to visit him. He had been lying in bed for several days with a hungry stomach. Tan Daoji personally comforted him and gave him meat and millet; he waved his hand to refuse, simply not appreciating it. He fully practiced the Confucian proposition in this way. He also has a poem of begging for food, describing how he begged for food from his neighbors when he had no food to eat. The neighbors knew that he was poor and often kept him for meals. The poem ends with the four words "I am grateful for your kindness, but ashamed of my lack of talent. How can I repay you? I will repay you in the dark," expressing how deeply engraved in his heart was his gratitude for the neighbors' hospitality! When people are poor, they easily become very sensitive, and causeless anger and excessive gratitude often accompany each other. We believe that Han Xin's "a meal's kindness will never be forgotten" and Hamsun's "seeing every passerby as an enemy" can coexist.</p>
<p>Literature is a feeling of real life; Mr. Lu Xun said; "As for the experience of life, not to mention anything else; as for the matter of being hungry, if you like it, you can try it. As long as you don't eat for two days, the aroma of rice will create a special temptation." It seems too early for those who do not have this minimum experience of life of "being hungry" to write about literature, although "being hungry" is not elegant or "leisurely".</p>
<h3 id="e197">Morning <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Floating Ice</p>
<p>The autumn of an island nation perhaps arrives extraordinarily early. A letter from a friend in my homeland still says: "The weather in Shanghai remains the same, and the swimming pools are still open." Yet the mornings in Tokyo already bring a chilling air.</p>
<p>Having come to this island nation, a month has already slipped by in a flash. I love the mornings in a foreign land the most, those tranquil mornings carrying a cool air. Every morning, I must walk alone on the deserted dirt roads, my feet stepping on tall "geta" sandals, so that even if it's muddy, my heels won't get stained. Above is a hazy sky, without a single cloud, not even a lark. The desolate sky is more desolate than my desolate mood. Sometimes, there might be a blurred white mist, using a faint atmosphere to congeal the earth. However, what a powerless gas it is!</p>
<p>I tread upon this quiet morning, gazing at everything around me. The dense houses, the wooden buildings, are still sleeping. Only the chimney of the bathhouse, which had been belching flames all night, still strains its tired body, stretching its arms in mid-air. Occasionally, one or two barks of a dog break the long silence, but even this rarely disturbs my peaceful mood.</p>
<p>At this time, past life floats up in my silent heart, like a lone boat in the ocean. That year of life was a dream, a nightmare. Around me, surrounded by many seductive poisonous claws, sensual tones, life had long robbed me of the courage to fight. I immersed myself in the turbid torrent, like duckweed, drifting with the waves, as if a lone boat in the ocean encountered a tremendous hurricane, with mountain-like waves surging fiercely around me. At times, I also wanted to struggle. I cried out angrily, but this cry only fueled the mocking laughter of the raging waves. My surroundings were then filled with an extremely dense black atmosphere. I couldn't see the sunlight, let alone the red light of a star.</p>
<p>However, I still had a last breath of strength. I uttered a primal cry from the depths of my heart, reminding me of the strength of my ancestors, reminding me of my past spirit. "You're still young! A young man of twenty!" A loud, resounding voice warned me in my heart. So, I opened my dull eyes, stretched out my arms, and let out a long howl in the black ocean. It was the battle cry of charging in a primal struggle. I picked up the oar again and fought against the dark, raging waves. Finally, I broke through the deep, black atmosphere and saw the red light on the opposite shore.</p>
<p>At that moment, light shone from all sides. I met my former brothers again. "Comrades, I'm back!" I shouted joyfully, regardless of whether they heard me, regardless of whether they still cast doubtful glances at me. However, I had triumphed from the struggle. I celebrated myself in this quiet, cool morning light.</p>
<p>Reflecting on this past struggle, my lonely heart surged with fervor. The blood throughout my body circulated. Suddenly, a long howl echoed in mid-air. The city began to roar. I looked up and saw a bright rising sun in the east!</p>
<p>I will tread upon this cool morning light, counting the surging pulses of my blood.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Honorary Old Woman (11) <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Ma Xiu, Translated by Ren Jun</p>
<p>"Hey, I am Yongzao's substitute!" The old woman's eyes sparkled; Number One walked around in the narrow room, waving her hands, and said in an extremely agitated tone: "I am a corporal, rank six, a glorious war death. Hey, let's all drink happily, drink until we collapse! I have simply never been happier. Glory, glory! Ah, this is glory, this is glory!"</p>
<p>Then, the old woman danced with strange hand and foot movements, elated.</p>
<p>From this point on, people were convinced that the old woman had truly gone mad.</p>
<p>After the funeral, the cooking old woman came to my house early in the morning, as usual, and worked until night. She worked as well as ever, without any signs of madness. The only difference was that her speech contained more laughable elements and she took out the "cat skin" and plucked it in the dormitory more frequently than before. Although the people at home sympathized with her, they also found it quite difficult to deal with.</p>
<p>Another very obvious thing was the excessive use of the two words "honor." The nickname "Honorary Old Woman" started from this time.</p>
<p>Once, I was in a hurry to go to the factory because of something. At that time, I tripped over something and fell.</p>
<p>"This is honor, this is honor, get up quickly!"</p>
<p>The old woman shouted this in the worker's dormitory.</p>
<p>I got up. My knees were badly scraped, bleeding a lot.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter!" The old woman said more seriously when she saw this situation: "Glorious wounds, a medal is coming."</p>
<p>These things were nothing. At that time, it was, without a doubt, a common catchphrase. However, the old woman loved cats very much; she often picked them up, kissing their cheeks as if she liked them very much, and said to them:</p>
<p>"Lovely cat, honorary cat!"</p>
<p>In the same tone, she continued to use "honorary flower," "honorary brother," "honorary wife," and so on.</p>
<p>One day, near the old woman's house, a poor, single old man hanged himself. She ran to my mother and described the old man's kindness and his poor and lonely life with deep sympathy; then, with tears in her eyes, she said:</p>
<p>"I think this is so pitiful! But this is also honor!"</p>
<p>My mother laughed.</p>
<p>"There is no honor in a person hanging themselves."</p>
<p>"It is also honor." The old woman stubbornly insisted on her own opinion very seriously. "Although he didn't die in battle; but, he died in destitution. I think this is also honor..."</p>
<p>"Then," my mother laughed even harder, "like your son, the government will probably issue about three hundred taels to this hanged old man."</p>
<p>"Probably so. It is truly a glorious thing."</p>
<p>The old woman said seriously all along.</p>
<p>My mother found it very funny. Then, my mother explained to her in detail how death in battle and death by hanging are different, and what honor really means. However, the old woman did not listen to my mother at all. She just said:</p>
<p>"Honor! An enviable thing!"</p>
<h3 id="e199">Around Lunchtime <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Shi</p>
<p>Before ten o'clock, I was urging my wife to quickly cook lunch, because I had arranged to go to Mr. Qin's house at noon. Mr. Qin had recently become an official, and I was confident that future interactions with him would be of no small help to me. Of course, I am not someone without self-awareness. I am not fit to be an official, and I do not want to be one, but to introduce me to a small job to relieve my poverty would not be too difficult for him, I thought.</p>
<p>In any case, I have been unemployed for too long, from September of the year before last until now. For these full two years, I have been relying on publishing some articles piecemeal, fortunately, my family has not starved to death. But now it is very different. Bookstores do not have the resources to buy manuscripts and publish single volumes, and the lively magazines of the year have also successively ceased publication, so even if I write non-stop every day, I cannot exchange it for money.</p>
<p>Yes, I have been writing non-stop for two years, writing non-stop, even if I cannot write, I have to write, which has caused me to feel great pain. Of course, this is for the sake of my family's livelihood. But apart from this, there is also the reason for writing; to embellish my life with writing is my most important career, like the lark's cry high in the clouds, which is its own need for life, and also to make the world more beautiful. However, this is an inappropriate metaphor; can I freely soar in the sky? And is the world made more beautiful by the cry of this little lark? On the contrary, I am only fit to be a cuckoo, crying day and night, even if the crying is mixed with a heavy bloody smell, telling people that the world is infinitely desolate, which is also my duty! Otherwise, I can only be a sparrow shivering in front of the eaves in winter. When white snow tightly covers the earth, not allowing me to find any food to feed myself and the hungry children in the nest, I have to chirp, although this low cry may not get a drop of sympathy from the empty world, I still struggle to live on!</p>
<p>This is my last courage; in any case, I must struggle to live on. The small grass that grows in the arid desert is also the goodwill of nature's creation, who can suppress its right to grow? Unfortunately, I was born with a stubborn personality, and unfortunately, my ancestors and father bequeathed me shame and justice, which makes me unfit to live in this cruel era. Ah! This cruel era! How many young people have been driven to the line of death amidst national ruin, family destruction, natural disasters, and wars, and how many young people are unemployed, enduring hunger.</p>
<p>These things, these things, I have been repeatedly thinking about recently, and I am thinking about them again today.</p>
<p>After eating, I put on my clothes, took the two dimes my wife gave me for the bus fare, and walked out the door with great hope. On the road, I saw that my black leather shoes were very shiny, which was my wife's careful love for me. Because of this, I immediately remembered my wife's words:</p>
<p>"You are bitten in the heart by poverty, you are too decadent. You have to cheer up, don't forget to pile up a smile on your face, when you ask your friends to find you a job, don't make people look down on my husband!"</p>
<p>Yes, this sentence is very correct, why should I be laughed at because of poverty? At least I should not forget that I am also a person, I cannot be despised and insulted because of poverty. So I straightened my chest and made the leather shoes walk loudly on the road. I touched my newly shaved beard and my hair, which I had applied a lot of Vaseline to in the morning, and I pretended to be very satisfied with my good luck.</p>
<p>The road to Mr. Qin's house is not very far, with my vigorous spirit, I can walk there in less than half an hour. So I saved the streetcar fare, and it would be good to leave it to buy vegetables tomorrow. If the opportunity is good, if Mr. Qin is willing to take care of me and give me a position, then it would be more comfortable and glorious to come back by rickshaw immediately, wouldn't it? Thinking of this, I couldn't restrain the joy in my heart. A few days ago, I had left a note at his house, stating that I would go to his house to talk to him at twelve o'clock today when he came home for lunch. Although the note did not specify what to talk about, but with my three years of old friendship with him, and his clear knowledge of my unemployment, how could he not understand my intention?</p>
<p>No matter from which aspect, Mr. Qin is truly my good friend who understands me. After I lost my job, he lent me a large sum of money when he had not yet become an official; I have not yet repaid it until now, and I feel a little sorry in my heart. But as long as I have a job, I will first repay his loan, although he may not be waiting for this money to use.</p>
<p>Soon, I walked to the gate of Mr. Qin's house, which had a parakeet hanging on it. I pressed the doorbell, walked into the living room, and stepped on the soft carpet. But he had not yet returned. Mrs. Qin cordially invited me to sit on the velvet sofa. He had recently rented this new-style foreign house, and the decorations on the walls and the furnishings in the house were very elegant. I casually flipped through the pictorial on the table, patiently waiting for him to return.</p>
<p>After about twenty minutes, Mr. Qin called; because he had to attend a banquet, he would not come home for lunch. This immediately made me feel worried. Afterwards, Mrs. Qin let me talk to him on the phone, and I said:</p>
<p>"Mr. Qin, aren't you coming back? I am waiting for you."</p>
<p>"Hello!" His voice was still so bright. "Because there is something going on, I can't come back. What do you want to talk to me about?"</p>
<p>"It's nothing, just chatting casually." I was shy, how could I say it directly? In the end, I boldly told him, and he said:</p>
<p>"Have you looked for others to help you find a way?"</p>
<p>"I have looked for many people, but no one can help..."</p>
<p>"But I can't help either!" His voice was very loud; "Okay, let's talk about it later."</p>
<p>I walked out of the gate of his house dejectedly, the parakeet on the frame seemed to give me a bitter smile. I felt very tired, but I still walked home. In any case, I still have to live on, and it is always enough to leave two dimes to buy vegetables tomorrow.</p>

<p>— Yue Qi</p>
<p>The first application of the "persuasion" story</p>
<p>——Medical Story Eleven——</p>
<p>October 16, 1846, is a great day worth commemorating. If you don't believe it, read the story recorded by Dr. G. M. Angell below.</p>
<p>The story took place at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. This is a hospital founded in 1811 with a long history in the United States. At that time, the chief surgeon was Dr. John Warren, who also served as a professor of surgery at Harvard University.</p>
<p>In the winter of 1846, medical students in Boston heard a message: Someone had invented an anesthetic that could eliminate the pain of patients undergoing surgery. Later, they heard another message: Dr. Warren of Massachusetts General Hospital would use this anesthetic when amputating a patient's leg. This message soon spread to newspapers throughout the city, causing discussion in the medical community. Before that time, several anesthetics had been tested, but some were only suitable for tooth extraction, and some completely failed. Until then, a completely applicable anesthetic for major surgery had not actually been invented. This message aroused great interest, as expected.</p>
<p>"On the morning of October 16," Dr. Angell said, "I ran to the hospital as usual, but much earlier than usual, because judging from Dr. Warren's reputation and the importance of this experiment, I determined that there would be many people attending.</p>
<p>"When I arrived, the hospital gate was already crowded with a large group of people, the end of the line extending to the street. The gate was still closed and would not open until a certain time. I led a student through the side door and ran straight into the operating room, selected a seat, and sat there waiting. The layout of the operating room was like a circular theater, with several rows of seats arranged on three sides. The seats were surrounded by railings, inside the railings was an operating table, and behind it was a door leading to the hospital ward.</p>
<p>"The seats of me and my companion were in the front row, directly opposite the operating table. At this time, the crowd outside the door gathered more and more; when the gate opened, they poured into the circular theater like a tide, packed tightly, and many could not find a seat, so they had to stand and wait.</p>
<p>"Soon, Dr. Warren walked in, followed by a young man. The young man held a glass ball in his hand, about eight inches in diameter, with a mouth at the top, plugged with a wooden gun, and filled with a transparent liquid; we did not know what it was.</p>
<p>I personally did not know this young man; I only knew from the whispers of the person next to me that he was Dr. Morton, the inventor of the new anesthetic to be tested this time.</p>
<p>"After a while, the attendant brought the patient to be operated on and placed them on the operating table. The patient was a woman, about twenty-four or five years old. Three young interns stood side by side opposite Dr. Warren, and Dr. Morton stood by the railing, no more than a few feet from our seats, holding the glass ball filled with transparent liquid in his hand."</p>
<p>Dr. Warren began to discuss the condition. He explained that the patient was suffering from ischial osteomyelitis of the knee joint. He stated that various methods of alleviating pain had been used on the patient, but none had been effective. Therefore, the patient had to have their leg amputated. He had explained this to the patient, informing them that there was no other way, and had obtained the patient's consent.</p>
<p>When Dr. Warren said this, the entire audience was silent. From the front row to the back row, not a single whisper was heard, nor the sound of writing with a pencil.</p>
<p>Dr. Warren slowly turned his head, faced the audience, and said in a particularly solemn tone:</p>
<h3 id="e202">Things to Know About Quitting Opium (2) <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhongming</p>
<p>Chapter 2: The Value of Opium in Medicine</p>
<p>Opium does indeed occupy an important position in pharmacology. Its effectiveness is rapid and its treatment is miraculously effective. Other drugs often lament their inferiority. When used properly, patients are amazed by its miraculousness. Otherwise, many abuses arise, which are unimaginable. Discussing the effects of opium, a small amount is stimulating, a large amount is anesthetic, and more than that causes acute poisoning. Regular use leads to chronic poisoning, which is the various phenomena described in the previous chapter after smoking.</p>
<p>Physicians should be cautious and thorough in the application of opium. Even a slight negligence can easily lead to poisoning. Special attention should be paid to children taking it. According to reports, children often die from dysentery caused by using opium ash. This is all due to ignorance of the pharmacology of opium. As for the value of opium in medicine, it is only a good medicine for treating symptoms and saving lives. Judging from its fundamental therapeutic efficacy, it is very limited. Hearing this suddenly, one may suspect it is inaccurate, but once one examines the reality, it is rarely difficult to understand. For example, to treat cough, we can use opium to suppress it, but fundamental treatment requires expectorants. Another example is abdominal pain, which can also be treated with opium, but to prevent its recurrence, one must use methods to clear the intestines. From this point of view, the effect of opium can only be a supplementary agent for fundamental treatment and cannot be used as the sole main medicine. If one does the opposite and uses opium exclusively to treat diseases, the result will inevitably be the pain of addiction developing and the disease not being cured. Those who use opium to treat diseases should think deeply about this. Opium is not a good medicine for fundamental treatment, but its emergency rescue and symptom-treating effects have indelible achievements in medicine. When acute diseases occur (such as severe pain), anesthetic drugs must be used to relieve the crisis momentarily. Otherwise, the patient will be moaning in pain and unable to undergo any examination or treatment.</p>
<p>Moreover, opium is highly addictive, so its use should only be limited to a short period. If taken for a slightly longer period, it will develop into chronic poisoning, which is no different from smoking opium. Once chronic poisoning develops, its effects gradually diminish. Initially, a large amount can still achieve a momentary effect, but as the opium addiction deepens, even strong drugs are not easily effective. Therefore, doctors have no good solution when those with deep addiction need emergency treatment. This is why. Now, the effects of opium are listed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Pain: All kinds of pain after major and minor surgeries, as well as stomach pain, abdominal pain, etc., are easily suppressed. However, it is ineffective for headaches.</p>
<p>(2) Diarrhea: Opium has the effect of stopping gastrointestinal motility, so it can be used as an antidiarrheal agent.</p>
<p>(3) Asthma and cough: Opium has the effect of calming qi and stopping cough.</p>
<p>(4) Insomnia: Most effective for insomnia caused by pain.</p>
<p>(5) Nerve stimulation: Has miraculous effects on brain stimulation, such as epilepsy, brain spasm, and poisoning.</p>
<p>(6) Internal bleeding: Such as lung bleeding and gastrointestinal bleeding. Because opium has the effect of reducing internal organ movement, it is often used in the medical field as a hemostatic adjuvant.</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Methods of Quitting Opium</p>
<p>There are many methods of quitting opium, and most of them are effective. Sometimes, even immortal water talismans and incantations can lead to abstinence. Sometimes, even truly scientific methods fail. There is no other reason. Opium is a nerve toxin. The psychology of smokers is most easily unpredictable. They often abandon their great efforts due to extremely small setbacks, or doubt and fear the diseases after quitting, are indecisive, or yearn for the pleasure of smoking and have no determination to quit. This kind of psychology not only hesitates when about to quit but often occurs after quitting. Therefore, doctors must first understand the psychology of smokers and constantly encourage their courage to make the determination to quit. Those undergoing abstinence should also accept the doctor's guidance with complete faith. Then the progress of quitting opium will be twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>Whether quitting opium is painful is one of the most concerning issues for smokers. But when asking them one by one, they are often troubled by the environment and cannot speak frankly and directly. Why? If one speaks of its advantages (such as reporting that there is no pain at all, working as usual, being full of energy, etc.), then the occurrence of pain in the future will inevitably leave a basis for deceiving and exaggerating. If one speaks of its disadvantages (such as various uncomfortable phenomena after quitting), it will increase the smokers' doubts and fears, making them dare not attempt to quit opium. However, in reality, there will inevitably be discomfort during the abstinence period. This is undeniably true. If one can endure it for a while, there will eventually be a day when bitterness ends and sweetness comes. Those quitting should deeply understand this.</p>

<p>(68) Stomatitis (Continued)</p>
<p>(Second) Ulcerative Stomatitis</p>
<p>The causes of ulcerative stomatitis are mostly infection and poisoning. It easily occurs in crowded places such as barracks, prisons, and orphanages when infectious. When caused by poisoning, it is mostly due to taking mercury-containing drugs internally. This condition is specifically called mercurial stomatitis, which is frequently encountered clinically. Poisoning from lead, phosphorus, arsenic, and copper is less common. Patients with anemia, weakness, tuberculosis, diabetes, scurvy, glandular disease, and rickets are also prone to this disease.</p>
<p>The main symptom of this disease is necrosis that first occurs in the gingival mucosa of the lower jaw, gradually spreading to the oral mucosa of the lips and cheeks. This change in the gums is most evident in severe mercurial stomatitis. When ulcers occur, they are usually covered with purulent matter. The gums are red and swollen and bleed easily. Once necrosis and ulceration occur in the gingival margin mucosa, the teeth often become loose and may even fall out. Saliva secretion is particularly vigorous. Lymph nodes in the jaw, neck, etc., are often swollen, and the mouth develops a foul odor. Patients usually feel pain in the mouth, making eating difficult. The course of the disease is about eight to fourteen days. Its treatment is roughly the same as that for catarrhal stomatitis.</p>
<p>(Third) Aphthous Stomatitis</p>
<p>Aphthous stomatitis is often epidemic. Weak children are most likely to develop it. Its main cause is mostly poor oral hygiene and irritation of the oral mucosa by sharp teeth during the first teething period in children. In addition, it often occurs during the course of infectious diseases such as pneumonia, typhoid fever, measles, and scarlet fever, as well as during menstruation, postpartum, and lactation in women.</p>
<p>The main symptom of this disease is the appearance of yellow or grayish-white spots on the oral mucosa, about the size of a pinhead or a small bean, slightly raised, with a deep red halo around them. These spots occur most often on the edge of the tongue and frenulum, and less often on the lips and buccal mucosa. The spots are generally firmly attached to the mucosal surface, making them very difficult to peel off. If forced, they will bleed. Patients usually feel burning, dryness, pain, and increased saliva secretion in the mouth. Eating is naturally difficult. In addition, it is noteworthy that children often develop high fever. The course of the disease is about one or two weeks, but it is prone to recurrence. The treatment strategy is also to clean the mouth, avoid irritation, and frequently rinse with mouthwash (or wash the mouth in children).</p>
<h3 id="e204">Common Sense Q&amp;A About Teeth (6) <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Jianxian</p>
<p>(Question 26) How many more permanent teeth are there than primary teeth?</p>
<p>(Answer) Everything else is the same, except that there are three more molars on each side than primary teeth, for a total of twelve more teeth.</p>
<p>(Question 27) Many middle-aged people do not have thirty-two teeth, but are missing one or two, or two or three. What is the reason?</p>
<p>(Answer) This is because the third molar on the inside has not yet grown out. This tooth is often buried under the gums in the jawbone. Sometimes it doesn't come out until the age of thirty or forty. This tooth will be discussed later.</p>
<p>(Question 28) Do each of the permanent teeth have their own specific functions?</p>
<p>(Answer) Generally speaking, incisors are used to bite and cut food, so they are shaped like chisels; canines are used to tear food, so they are shaped like cones; molars are used to crush and grind food, so their occlusal surface is large and has raised and sunken patterns like a millstone. In terms of chewing function, molars are the most important. Therefore, molars should be carefully protected and not allowed to decay.</p>
<p>(Question 29) Which molar is the most important?</p>
<p>(Answer) It is the first molar. There is one on each side of the jaw, top and bottom. It can be considered the cornerstone of the dental arch. If it decays and falls out, the other permanent teeth are easily loosened, leading to tilting and decay. Moreover, chewing becomes difficult. In addition, the chin will recede, and the face will become asymmetrical. Therefore, this molar should not be allowed to decay and be lost. Parents should not mistakenly think that it is a temporary primary tooth and not pay attention to it.</p>
<p>(Question 30) How can the first molar not be mistaken for a primary tooth?</p>
<p>(Answer) (1) It comes out only at the age of six (so it is commonly called the six-year molar). (2) It grows next to the back primary molar, on the inside. If a child has three molars in their mouth, the one on the innermost side (the sixth one counting from the central incisor) is undoubtedly it. (3) It is whiter and larger than the primary molars. From these three points, it can be distinguished from a primary tooth.</p>
<p>(Question 31) If a permanent tooth decays and is lost, or is extracted, will another tooth grow out to replace it?</p>
<p>(Answer) Once a permanent tooth is lost, no tooth will ever grow back. Therefore, permanent teeth should be treasured.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 The Structure and Parts of Teeth</p>
<p>(Question 32) How are teeth formed?</p>
<p>(Answer) Teeth can be said to grow from epidermal cells, just like fingernails and hair. The mucous membrane in our mouth is a layer of epidermis. Inside it, there are odontoblasts. Initially, it is soft tissue, which gradually calcifies and becomes hard bone tissue, thus forming teeth.</p>
<p>(Question 33) How many segments can a tooth be divided into from head to toe?</p>
<p>(Answer) It can be divided into three segments: (1) The crown, which accounts for about one-third of the total length, is the part exposed outside the gums. (2) The neck, which is at the edge of the gums. (3) The root, which is embedded in the alveolar socket.</p>
<p>(Question 34) How many roots does a tooth have?</p>
<p>(Answer) Incisors, canines, and premolars all have only one root (sometimes the upper premolars have two roots). Lower molars have two roots. Upper molars have three roots. But there are many exceptions.</p>
<p>(Question 35) How many layers can a tooth be divided into?</p>
<p>(Answer) It can be divided into three layers, the main parts: the outermost layer is enamel. The second layer is dentin. The innermost layer is pulp.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Medical Science of Pain Relief (37) <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Li Xing</p>
<p>This type of medicine can be used, but it is important to note that the first priority in pain relief should be to remove the cause of the pain. Once the cause is removed and the pain stops, it will not recur. If one does not seek to remove the cause but only seeks to relieve the pain, it is actually equivalent to ladling boiling water. Therefore, it is in line with medical science to treat the cause of the disease while taking a certain amount of pain medication when in pain. Note that sometimes using other beneficial and harmless therapies, such as heat therapy, hydrotherapy, and diathermy, is better than taking pain medication. Taking pain medication should be used as a temporary or very short-term emergency measure: for example, if a headache occurs in the middle of the night, one can take pain medication, but the next day one should seek fundamental treatment for the headache, and should not just take pain medication every time one has a headache. Pain medication will not cure the disease, it only temporarily suppresses the sensation of pain. Furthermore, although pain medication is not particularly harmful to the body when used infrequently, it is also not beneficial. Long-term internal use is harmful to the body. Therefore, using pain medication is a symptomatic treatment, not a root treatment. By using pain medication according to these principles, one can obtain benefits, but if one takes pain medication haphazardly, the result will inevitably be half benefit and half harm. I will briefly describe the types of pain medication below:</p>
<p>Salicylate Compounds</p>
<p>The most important drugs in this class are: (1) sodium salicylate, (2) acetylsalicylic acid (i.e., aspirin), (3) methyl salicylate (i.e., wintergreen oil), and (4) cinchophen. Generally speaking, these drugs, in addition to their pain-relieving effect, do not have any particular toxicity if not taken in excessive amounts. These drugs also have antipyretic effects. These drugs are mostly used for rheumatic diseases and neuralgia, acute arthritis, etc. These drugs do not appear to have any particular effect on other chronic painful conditions.</p>
<p>Sodium Salicylate is mostly used for acute arthritis and rheumatic pain, and it is very effective when used properly. Note that for rheumatic pain caused by carditis, this drug can only temporarily relieve pain and reduce fever, but it will recur after stopping the drug, because the drug cannot cure carditis. Taking too much internally can cause symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and tinnitus. These side effects will stop after stopping the drug. Taking too much internally can also suppress the nervous system, respiratory system, or suppress blood flow, leading to collapse, and sometimes miscarriage can occur. The usual dose starts from one gram. It is best taken with sodium bicarbonate.</p>
<p>Aspirin is the most famous pain reliever. It is quite effective for relieving headaches, neuralgia, rheumatic pain, etc. In addition to its pain-relieving effect, aspirin also has an antipyretic effect. Its pain-relieving effect is probably due to suppressing sensation, and its antipyretic effect is to reduce the body's metabolism and increase the body's heat dissipation. Each internal dose can last for several hours at most, after which it must be taken again. It is okay to use it for temporary pain relief, but it is unreasonable to take it for a long time. Using this drug can be said to be treating the symptoms, while treating the root cause requires finding the cause of the pain and then treating the symptoms accordingly. For example, it is a proper way to take it temporarily for a toothache or headache, but it is wrong to rely entirely on these drugs to treat every toothache or every headache, because only by understanding the cause and then removing the source of the disease can the pain be permanently eliminated. If the source of the disease is not removed, the pain may recur at any time. Then, taking these drugs internally for a long time without seeking to remove the cause of the disease is inevitably a pointless敷衍. For example, if the cause of the headache is syphilitic pain, it is also reasonable to take pain medication when the pain is extreme, but the fundamental treatment is to inject a special drug for syphilis.</p>
<p>Methyl Salicylate (Wintergreen Oil) has similar medicinal properties to sodium salicylate. Applying it externally to swollen and painful areas, such as arthritis and neuritis, also has a pain-relieving effect. Internal use can also relieve pain, but it is more toxic. For external application, one part of this drug mixed with two parts of olive oil is the appropriate amount. This drug does not need to be taken internally. If one ounce is taken internally at once, it can be life-threatening.</p>
<p>Cinchophen (also known as Atophan) has the same properties as sodium salicylate and aspirin and is also used to relieve pain. Neocinchophen is the same. Do not use too much of this drug, or for too long, as the side effects are very severe.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Brief Introduction to Pulmonary Tuberculosis (71) <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Chapter 12 Treatment of Pulmonary Tuberculosis</p>
<p>Section 3 Rest and Nutrition</p>
<p>Taking a step back, even if it is suitable for high-altitude convalescence, we must never be overly superstitious about the climate here, believing that it has an incredible effect on this disease. This view is completely wrong. Because there is absolutely no climate that is universally effective for all pulmonary tuberculosis patients; if such words are spread, it must be "Xiang Zhuang's sword dance," "the old drunkard's intention is not in the wine," we should recognize this clearly. The doctor's purpose in advising the patient to change location is not only to rely on the climate of the new location, but to enable the patient to correctly implement the principles of health convalescence. What must not be forgotten is the rule of air therapy. Furthermore, once the patient leaves home, all the bad habits and environmental stimuli that usually hinder convalescence can be completely improved, which is greatly beneficial to the future of the disease. If one abandons these two and relies solely on the climate to seek good results, that will of course greatly disappoint the recipient.</p>
<p>So what is the true value of convalescence in a different location? It can be effective in early infiltration, proliferation, and sclerotic forms (even if expansive). It is particularly effective in reducing or eliminating fever and increasing appetite; all other symptoms can also be reduced as a result.</p>
<p>Of course, there are a very large number of patients who cannot afford to convalesce in a different location due to their personal financial situation, but they must not be pessimistic. If they pay sufficient attention in their own home or near their hometown, and strictly observe various convalescence rules, the results are not necessarily less than those of patients convalescing in a different location. Because, with the exception of all other things, there is a distinction between rich and poor, but nature treats everyone equally; the so-called fresh air is something that everyone can enjoy, and does not require material rewards! I respectfully offer this truth to the readers of this book!</p>

<p>Shen Bao Local Supplement</p>
<p>Idle Talk</p>
<h3 id="e207">Anti-Slave Girl Movement <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Chui</p>
<p>In the previous local supplement of Shen Bao, Mr. Meng Ruo published an article "Anti-Slave Girl Movement," which was very pleasant to read, but after thinking about it carefully, these are all grand words spoken in a hall, not heartfelt conversations in an inner room. Chinese people like to "speak official language," and this is one of those cases. Here, I would like to raise two questions about the practice of keeping slave girls:</p>
<p>First, which parents would not cherish their daughters and willingly sell them to others as slave girls?</p>
<p>Second, are all slave girls abused by their masters, like a certain young lady in Tianjin?</p>
<p>Assuming the answer is no, I have a few words to say. Impoverished couples cannot afford to eat their fill, but their sexual urges cannot be ignored, so they commit a great wrong and produce such an abomination. Do they kill it? They can't bear to. Do they raise it? They can't afford to. As a last resort, they sell this piece of their heart. This can both feed their daughter and feed themselves, and the system of keeping slave girls is born from this.</p>
<p>As for people keeping slave girls, there is also a reason for it. Originally, they wanted to hire servants, but even if they hired servants, if they could buy slave girls, they could have someone to order around and save someone in need, which is a double benefit. It does not necessarily mean that they are irritable and have nowhere to vent, so they buy a slave girl to abuse in every way, beat her severely, and scold her to vent the anger in their belly. If that were the case, why would I allow others to buy slave girls, but Mr. Meng Ruo cannot keep slave girls? Because he wants to use slave girls to vent his anger.</p>
<p>Although I have heard of cases of abusing slave girls, such masters are all tyrannical by nature, like the madam in a brothel or a certain young lady in Tianjin. Otherwise, there are tens of thousands of families keeping slave girls, and the number of abuse cases is relatively small. One cannot say that because an incest case occurred in a certain province, most people in that province are parricides. One cannot say that because a case of murdering one's husband occurred in a certain place, most women in that place are murderers of their husbands. Such reasoning is inappropriate. Therefore, although a certain young lady in Tianjin abused slave girls, it cannot be said that most slave owners are like a certain young lady in Tianjin. Furthermore, people who are tyrannical by nature will abuse not only slave girls but also servants, and not only servants but also in-laws and daughters-in-law. Assuming that there are cases of abusing servants and abusing in-laws and daughters-in-law, does that mean that we should abolish the master-servant system and the in-law-daughter-in-law system altogether? I am afraid that is also impossible.</p>
<p>The term "slave girl system" is not appropriate in the first place. Keeping slave girls is only a custom, not a system. All so-called systems contain legal or compulsory elements. Although the government has no explicit prohibition against keeping slave girls, it also has no measures to encourage it. This is a kind of buying and selling behavior combined by folk customs and needs. If you call it a system, I would consider it an excellent system, as it can both save the poor and provide convenience.</p>
<p>Mr. Meng Ruo also said that in the passive aspect, one must start with rescuing slave girls. I think this is the active aspect, not the passive aspect. However, Mr. Meng Ruo's only way to rescue slave girls is to set up a slave girl rescue center to accommodate slave girls who are unwilling to be slave girls or who are abused. I am afraid this is still not enough, because to rescue slave girls, one must first save the parents of the slave girls, and then the system of keeping slave girls will naturally be abolished. But may I ask if the country's finances are like this, the local finances are like this, and the social phenomena are like this, is there a way to do it? In the local matchmaking industry, old women are so numerous that there is almost no place to stand. I think that if the system of keeping slave girls could be made public, the slave girl trading industry would also prosper in the same way. Therefore, I would like to ask Mr. Meng Ruo to first understand the social phenomena and then carry out the anti-slave girl movement.</p>

<p>— Shixi</p>
<p>I feel so lonely, especially in every moment facing the lonely lamp and melancholy.</p>
<p>It seems like it was last year, I drifted out of the bloody palms of my hometown, exhausted and hungry, wandering: from this corner to another corner, and from another corner to this corner, like a camel covered in musk heading towards the desolate Siberian plain.</p>
<p>In ××, by chance, I met a long-lost friend. She was a cheerful person with a round face, a short stature, and a smile on her face, always squinting her eyes. She always faced things optimistically. She was a determinist who believed that there was nothing imperfect in the world; but that meeting quickly exposed the shaking of her subjective views. She began to learn to frown, smile wryly, and worry.</p>
<p>On a dark road, accompanied by our thin shadows, we walked lightly. She coughed softly, raised her head to look at the indifferent lamplight for a moment, then smiled coldly, and said to me sadly:</p>
<p>"Friend! You have really changed, you have become so melancholy, quiet..."</p>
<p>I still lowered my head and strode forward silently, the hobnails of my leather shoes knocking on the cement with a rhythmic, light and bright sound. The sound seemed so gloomy and desolate on this gray and quiet street!…</p>
<p>A breeze blew across the sea, carrying dampness and cold.</p>
<p>She shivered slightly, and then yawned a few loud yawns in annoyance. After a long silence, her long, annoyed tone vibrated in the silence again.</p>
<p>"In the past few years, I have also changed because of the hardships of life. Really, sometimes I not only feel that I am so melancholy, but also lonely..." Then there was a long sigh.</p>
<p>"Someone said: Loneliness is like an invisible termite in the human body, gnawing at the hearts of every young person with the fluctuations of life..." She had just said this when she began to sob again, shaking her head sadly.</p>
<p>A melancholy and lonely song came from the fishing boat on the sea, the tone carrying terrible melancholy and desolation.</p>
<p>My thoughts began to be a little confused, and I murmured in a low voice: "What time is it?..."</p>
<p>She quickly interjected: "Maybe it's about nine o'clock!"</p>
<p>"I should go back to the hotel!" I said silently, and stopped.</p>
<p>"What's the hurry?" she shouted anxiously.</p>
<p>We walked in silence like this for several minutes, when she suddenly seemed to remember something important and asked me in a low voice, "Sometimes you feel lonely, my good friend, do you ever think of suicide?" She cast a probing look at me solemnly.</p>
<p>"No!" I shook my head and continued, "I only long to sing lonely songs!"</p>
<p>A song was sobbing from the seaside again, she raised her head in emotion and looked blankly at the wide sky, and after a long time, she sighed in a low voice: "That's it! The lonely song?" Tears fell down in a rustling sound.</p>
<p>The next day I left ××, and since then we have not had the opportunity to meet again. When I arrived in Shanghai, I also received a pair of short and enthusiastic letters from her, she said: "Friend! You are right, loneliness is terrible; but I have also begun to learn to sing that - lonely song!…"</p>

<h3 id="e209">The Feeling of Smoke <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Whispers</p>
<p>When the state of mind falls into complete emptiness, the heart becomes as cold and empty as a vacuum. At this time, the world seems to be completely destroyed, and oneself, like being hung in mid-air, neither touching the sky above nor connected to the solid ground below, swaying, without any support. One cannot feel anything, and nothing can arouse interest, as if one is stiff and dead.</p>
<p>Encountering this kind of mood, only a cigarette can save it; nothing else seems to work. Smoke can stimulate one's nerves; smoke can revive a dead person. When a person is surrounded by the curling smoke, with eyes blurred, they can clear their mind. This sounds a bit strange, but it doesn't feel strange to say. Life is like light smoke, floating, floating, disappearing, and then the heart is disillusioned, dead. When one is in the midst of fragrant smoke, watching each smoke ring emerge from the throat, jump out from the bottom of the heart, then float upward, float upward; then the ring gradually expands; then it bursts; then the cigarette smoke hides towards the corner of the room, floats out the window, rises to the roof: in the air, the cigarette smoke is completely invisible, completely disappears; then the disillusioned mood suddenly realizes that life is also like light smoke: progressing from struggle, desperately climbing upward, radiating, then falling, then failing, then completely disappearing. People will wake up from this.</p>
<p>I don't know much about Buddhist principles, and I can't admire them with faith, but a novel called "Smoke" sometimes resonates with me. Although we are in the 20th century, we are far from the "smoke" era, our backgrounds are different, and our minds are different. However, the feeling of "smoke" can be tasted, because we are familiar with it, because we still sometimes share its power, because we are not completely separated from the "smoke" era, perhaps we cannot yet transcend the pre-"smoke" era?</p>
<p>I read "Smoke" many years ago, when I was too young and had too little life experience, so I didn't understand it very well. Now, I have entered "our world" for quite some time, so I climb, climb, then hit a wall, hit a wall; then I get stabbed; then I become disillusioned. Then, the smoke rings make me realize; then, "Smoke," which has been hidden in the corner of my mind for a long time, is recalled and resonated with. This may be the reason why Buddhism remains unchanged to this day, and why Buddhist principles are always studied and worshipped by people?</p>
<p>But, after waking up from the feeling of smoke, what then? Light another cigarette? Let the heart float, float again? Watch the smoke rings grow and disappear one by one again? This means, climb again in the world, climb, then fall again; then bear a body full of wounds again, climb again, fall again, fall and climb again, climb and fall again? People are really fools!</p>
<p>What is the "spirit of all things"? What is truly advanced humanity?</p>
<p>Look at the smoke again! You see it burning, burning, one smoke ring after another; one section of cigarette ash turns into embers, then another section of cigarette ash follows; the previous spark goes out, then the next spark follows. ... Then, the smoke is gone, the fire is completely extinguished, and a cigarette butt is thrown on the ground. On the ground, it burns, it still spits out strands of smoke, and then it is completely finished!</p>
<p>The smoke is gone, and the empty heart is no longer empty. The heart has gone through a journey from the moment the match lights the cigarette to the moment it is completely extinguished; the person has already experienced a week of life.</p>
<p>Then, the dream will suddenly wake up.</p>
<p>Are people really like smoke? Smoke will eventually disappear, but a second cigarette can follow. What about humanity? Humanity has sperm, history, books, axes, and machines.</p>
<p>Will the mood forever be immersed in smoke rings?</p>
<h3 id="e210">Night at Reed Sea <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Ai Tu</p>
<p>On the night I arrived in Changsha, my friends wanted to take me across the sea to Reed Sea. Of course, my mood was close to traveling, and I wouldn't miss going to a new place, especially since this is a very famous raw leaf market. It was even better for me.</p>
<p>After dinner, I followed my friends, hobbling out of the threshold of the towering building - this is the only famous school in Changsha. At that time, the setting sun still shone with a trace of light, turning Changsha Island from the sea to the quiet garden into a bleak and desolate red. Although this kind of brilliance is suitable for the senses of sad poets, I myself did not feel anything. After returning to the south this time, I had no interest in my home at all, and I didn't even want to go back for the two hours it would take. Such a chaotic family held no nostalgia for me. Therefore, after returning to the south, I still wandered as I did in Shanghai, without any sorrow lingering in my heart.</p>
<p>There, the desolate red of the setting sun shone broadly on the pond surface full of green lotus leaves, and also on the green leaves and bamboo forest by the pond. The reflected quiet appearance especially reminded me of the ghosts in a prison-like quiet countryside. However, I don't know what sentences those passionate poets and sad poets would use to depict it with their immortal pens?</p>
<p>We still loved a bit of childlike light noise, and talked and laughed as we first stepped onto the dock of Xinchang. The streets of Xinchang were already hung high with pale yellow electric lights, which was a warning of the coming of night! But! I was very happy, and while running on the not-so-popular cement road, I still dreamed of how to spend this night - because this night was too exciting for me, and I definitely wouldn't be able to sleep well. Therefore, I only hoped to be able to spend this quiet night on such a uniquely flavored street or on the dark sea.</p>
<p>We ran a lot from the west of Xinchang to the east, and the dim street lights still shone on us silently. When we arrived at the old dock for crossing the Reed Sea, I already felt the difference between two worlds.</p>
<p>The dock here is so dark! The uneven road is full of rubble, a bit like a beach. However, many, many people came and went here, all naturally and quickly. It made me feel too unfamiliar. I stepped onto a small boat. Look! On the other side is the street on the shore of Reed Sea, and the lights from the shops reflected on the clear water surface. When the slight waves rippled, the shadows of the lights also rippled at the bottom of the sea, from clear to hazy. In the distance, the gray or white walls made people believe that this semi-new and semi-old town was a good place for war. In the sky, the dark blue, bright sparse stars twinkled and revealed their lovely brilliance. Therefore, they were also reflected in the sea, like countless small lamps. A half-curved moon hid in the gray, light clouds like a shy girl. The boat swayed on the sea, and the light waves also undulated, so we believed even more that the moon had fallen into the deep sea and was shaking.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the streets of Reed Sea, it was no different from other cities, and the place was not small. There were also many people coming and going. Indeed, this small port was the most lively. There were many street vendors and peddlers. This is a prosperous area in the southwest corner of Taishan, so at night, it's a bit like a "city that never sleeps."</p>
<p>However, the liveliness or lack thereof of the streets didn't give me much feeling or nostalgia. Therefore, after running enough, we bought some sweets and stepped onto the small boat again. At this time, we really wanted to have an interesting night boat ride on the sea.</p>
<p>The sea at Reed Sea was so calm! It seemed that the universe had been buried in a dead garden. All we heard were the sounds of oars and water. The moon in the sky was even more hazy. We knew that it was already very late, and the boatman also wanted to sleep. So, quietly, we turned towards the dock of our home.</p>

<p>Begging Song</p>
<p>Autumn winds rise, autumn clouds fly, pieces of fallen leaves flutter all over the ground. Looking far at the boundless sky, only a group of lost swallows can be seen, wandering and flying in all directions! Alas! They are displaced from their homes, living without a fixed place and without warm clothes. Their huts are all washed away; their flesh and blood are separated. They can only bitterly beg for food while fleeing from the famine. How can they avoid the wind and rain, their bodies cold and their bellies hungry? They are truly lacking clothes and food, with no one to turn to!</p>
<p>The disaster victims are cold, the disaster victims are hungry, one by one crying and weeping. When the cold north wind rises, they will helplessly await death, gasping for breath! Dying, dying like insects! Compatriots! They are like wild dogs, no one to care for them, no one to pity them. Who has no brothers, who has no sisters? It is pitiful that they are wandering in ditches, relying entirely on your enthusiastic relief, and your generous donations. Donating a penny saves a life, and the merit is boundless!</p>

<p>On the second day of the broadcasting charity, reporters from *Zhong* and *Shishi* both arrived and spoke with Zhou Gong, Yang Cengshu, Zhu Fubao, and others from the Rose Troupe for a long time. Yinyu and Xu Qi were also present. A certain gentleman said: There are too many stimulating things to see. (I have long admired the two of you, but I have no chance to meet you, which is truly a missed opportunity. - Editor)</p>
<p>Jiang Manli took the stage, not singing "Goodbye, My Brother," but singing "Selling Fried Dough Sticks." Does she still miss life in Hankou? The accompanying Jiang is the elder brother of our own Peiyu.</p>
<p>A certain gentleman introduced Jin Yi and Li Yin to the reporters, and the snake's face showed a very deep expression.</p>
<p>The "Yinyu" problem has become a very serious incident. Because Yinyu was also</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>present that day, someone planned to search for her person with sharp eyes, but silver was never found.</p>
<p>There were not as many viewers that day as on the first day. There were fewer ladies than gentlemen (storytellers). Strange!</p>
<p>A staff member from a certain station who was not a member of the Broadcasting Association was refused entry because he had no ticket, leading to an argument. Jin Kanghou paid two yuan for him. This gentleman is very generous, and it can also be seen that every drop of charity is for the public good. We hope that at the end, we can open a proper account for us to see, and to thank the disaster victims everywhere! (Above by Jin Lang)</p>
<p>Mr. Yinyu: If you don't mind, please come to the editorial office for a chat. (Editor)</p>
<p>On a very, very hot night, two artists in the broadcasting circle performed a very good act: the male lead, Wang, a true old gentleman, was at the Xiandi Hotel (just like Zhang Yilu, the president of Vienna, who opened a room at the Greater Shanghai), and the female lead, Miss Jin Yi, went to Xiandi to play. This play lasted until 9:00 AM the next morning before she happily returned.</p>
<p>It has been a long time since news about the Qiyin Society has appeared in the newspaper. These two days have been a feast for the eyes. As soon as I see the three characters "Qiyin Society," it seems like I have a lot to say, even though I am not enemies with the society!</p>
<p>Several days ago (on the rainy day) at around 8:30 PM, I saw Xu Qi, the president of the Qiyin Society, swaying from Beijing Road towards Nicheng Bridge, seemingly following two female students in blue cloth gowns in front of him.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Chen Yaoting, Xu Qi wants to find my true identity. This really makes me anxious, because one, I haven't practiced Taijiquan, Xingyi, etc. well yet, and two, I have little social interaction, and I don't have old friends with hats on the northwest corner and cigarettes hanging on the bridge of the nose. This really makes me anxious!</p>
<p>According to Miss Meihua Yang, (Miss Meihua was also told by a certain Xu), the so-called Cao Cao's father works as a cook in the police station, and he himself is a servant, but he pretends to be a big shot outside! This group of people is really unimaginable. If I scold them, their skin is thicker than mine. If I hit them, I am not good enough. I only hope that the person in charge of each radio station will pay more attention!</p>
<p>I heard people say that the musician Zhou Mingyuan has almost completed a great work called "I Have Truly Let You Down" for two or three months. Congratulations! Can you send me a copy (please send it to the *Shen Bao* or *Shishi Xinbao* wireless radio column editor) so I can feast my eyes?</p>
<p>Recently, there are more and more reporters in the wireless radio broadcasting world every day. No wonder a certain group is surrounded by many big reporters. In the future, things that are even more stinky than this (the big reporter Wu Zhanda at Lili Radio Station issued wedding invitations on behalf of a certain group of young ladies surnamed Zhu, doing business like having a stroke!) will probably continue to be discovered! (Above by Yinyu)</p>
<p>A certain society president, who is always fooling around on the streets, and a certain gentleman who recently withdrew from a certain school society had the whimsical idea of borrowing the name of Yang Cengnu to forcibly pull members into the Qiyin Society and Dalu Society, using the members' withdrawal fees and society fees to borrow a society address to provide a place for them to take advantage of others.</p>
<p>The Yingyin Society is an amateur singing group. The person in charge of the society is very spirited, but unfortunately, that self-proclaimed leader, Miss Bai Guang (Zheng Shihuang), is a bit too arrogant.</p>
<p>According to Zhou Gongjun of the Rose Troupe: "Since the establishment of the society, there has been no one with the surname Xu Tao. However, when Shishi Lai came to our country to broadcast with a brazen face, he referred to himself as Uncle Dao Bo when he came to visit."</p>
<p>Ni, a friend of Hu Shi, hasn't been seen for a long time for some reason. He doesn't run to the radio station anymore. Perhaps it's the same as the snake's refusal to go to Dalu Radio Station?</p>
<p>"The president of the Ballemon Singing Society, Sister Liying, always speaks irresponsibly," Mr. Xu Tianying, the boss of Daguangming Photography Studio, told reporters in this way, but I, Bai Xue, say it's because Miss Liying is too young and too naive, right?</p>
<p>Xu Duanrong and Luyin went to the city chief's house to see Jin Yi last night. Because it was too early, they didn't meet her. Later, they took the San Yao tram together and their whereabouts are unknown. (Above by Bai Xue)</p>
<p>Miss Liying, who is called a little star by others, doesn't sing very well, but she likes to show off and often performs in various dance halls or on stage, unaware of her ugliness?</p>
<p>Miss Luo Ying was the original leader of the Business Society, but later, because Miss Ying became ill, Miss Pingping took over. After Miss Luo Ying recovered, the two of them competed for the leadership. Miss Pingping didn't know why she withdrew from the student society. I think she couldn't compete with Miss Luo Ying!</p>
<p>The female members of the Business Society have not been very harmonious recently.</p>
<p>The one who often submits articles to the newspaper under the name Heibai is Tao Dan. Miss Liying's methods are very spicy. I think those who have experienced her methods must know.</p>
<p>People say that Daziran and the Baijia Music Singing Society have disbanded. I don't think so. I heard that they are still working hard and hoping to develop!</p>
<p>Miss Xu Qi has recently returned to her original state.</p>
<p>Zhou Mingyuan has the nickname "Old Man."</p>
<p>On the day that the Baijia Society performed at the New World Amusement Park, Cai from the ×××× Society wanted to fight the entire staff of the society because of Miss Wang Meng's performance, saying "you die, I live." Although it's an old story, it's worth noting. (Above by Da)</p>

<p>In the "Triumphant Song" produced by Yihua Company and directed by Bu Wancang, Wang Yin and Yuan Meiyun play a pair of cousins who are in love.</p>
<p>On a very poetic evening, the two of them walked side by side from one side of the field, Meiyun carrying a water chestnut basket in her hand, and Wang Yin carrying an iron hoe on his shoulder.</p>
<p>The surroundings were quiet, and the evening scenery of the countryside could not have been better. The two of them talked and laughed while walking, and the scene seemed particularly intimate.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Wang Yin stopped and said to Meiyun: "Sister Guiying, I won't see you off anymore, I haven't gone home yet!" Ah! How sweet that voice is!</p>
<p>"Thank you, Brother Chunsheng, for walking so far with me." Ah! How sweet that voice is too!</p>
<p>"What are you saying? You can invite me to eat a few more water chestnuts later."</p>
<p>"Okay! Definitely."</p>
<p>The two of them finally separated and went home, but what exactly was the reluctance when they left? This is only for you to see in "Triumphant Song."</p>

<p>The Silver Moon Dance Troupe, organized by dance expert Ms. Zhang Qing'e, has been performing in various parts of South China since last winter, for a period of one year. Famous in the South, renowned in Fujian and Guangdong, among the major dance troupes that have emerged in recent years, Silver Moon is undoubtedly the best. It has now returned to Shanghai. Silver Moon is known for Feng Feng, Jin Yu, Xu Lingling, and Wu Dieying. In terms of dance skills, they are better than the so-called song and dance stars of today. After returning to Shanghai, they immediately devoted themselves to practice, without taking a moment's rest. Their spirit of diligence and hard work is rare in the song and dance world. It is no wonder that they want to cause a sensation on the red carpet. The troupe plans to give a large-scale performance in this city once special programs have been fully rehearsed.</p>
