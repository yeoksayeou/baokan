<h3 id="c44">減租運動與住宅問題 <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— 柳</p>
<p>减租要求。由來已久。先則房客房東各自團結。形成對峙之局面。經一二八之變。滬上市面。發生絕大之變動。减租緣是而要求益切。及至去年。恐慌露骨。百業蕭條。維持愈艱。房租仍有不减於往昔。負擔遂覺無形加重。年來業生自動减租。雖不在少。而最近一週。猶有所謂减租運動週者發生。殆尙有其不得已之衷情歟。吾人姑就一般之居住狀况。以論住宅問題解决之途徑。</p>
<p>上海之居住問題。夫人而知其不合理。所謂「鴿籠式」之房屋。幾爲一般所公認。至貧苦棚戶。則人畜相雜並處。卑濕汚穢。尤不堪設想。故上海之居住。可謂自上古時代之野處以至二十世紀之新建築無不備。其能享受「草地」</p>
<p>生活者固絕少。卽一宅一戶者亦占多數中之最少數。就上海市公安局之戶口調査。一爲檢討。卽可見其一斑。按本年七月分上海市戶口調査。（特區在外）正戶爲十八萬七千零五十三。附戶爲二十二萬六千七百二十三。就數字言。附戶較多三萬九千六百七十。就比率言。則爲正戶百分之一二一·二。若分區言之。更為明顯。下表卽以各該警察局所豁區內之正戶數作爲百分。而以內戶數對之作一比例。以示正戶對附戶之比率。</p>
<p>一　江灣吳淞區域</p>
<p>市中心　四二·四吳淞　七一·三藴藻浜　四六·八　江灣　九三·六二滬北區域</p>
<p>新閘　一三·七　蒙古路　一五七·六　恒豐路　一九七·二　眞茹　六五·三</p>
<p>北站　一四三·三　北四川路　一八六·四　永興路　二五七·八　臨平路　三四·七</p>
<p>引翔港　一七八·五三　滬西區域</p>
<p>曹宋渡　一二八·二　蒲淞　三九·二　徐家匯　九〇·〇　漕涇　八七·一四　滬南區域</p>
<p>西門　一二九·六　老北門　一三·一　文廟路　一四二·二　十六舖　一二五·九</p>
<p>董家渡　一六〇·六　邑廟　一九三·七　巡道街　一六七·九五　浦東區域</p>
<p>浦東　二三·四　楊家渡　六八·七　洋涇　六〇·三　塘橋　六一·一</p>
<p>楊思　六六·四　髙橋　一九·六　東溝　二九·三</p>
<p>從上表。凡市廛愈繁盛。則其附戶所占之比率亦愈大。吳淞江灣浦東。不如滬西。然浦東一區。如浦東與高橋。一則附戶有百分之一一三·四。一則僅有百分之一九·六。滬西雖繁盛。尙不如滬南滬北。蓋滬西一部分爲華洋富商之住宅區。附戶自少。滬南滬北。恃其原有之市廛。又年有增益。戶口殷盛。爲華界各地冠。因之附戶所得之比率。亦逐漸膨脹。若滬北之永興路。臨平路滬南之老北門各警局所管區。一正戶而附戶竟在二家以上。其他平均亦在一家以上。特區戶口之繁密。更非華界所可及。除少數中產以上人家住宅區外。均因房租昻貴。分租之風甚熾。故附戶若果有數字可尋。其百分比當必視華界爲大。夫跼踳於斗室之中。飮食烹飪於是。起居偃臥於是。兒女哭笑於是。賓客接待於是。終日工作辛勤。而所以恢復疲勞藉資休息者僅如是。都市居民之生活亦劇可憐矣。</p>
<p>若此爲住宅不足之影響歟。則應增加其供給。平準其房價。使一般人咸得享受較爲合理之「夜半世」生活。如爲房租昂貴。而不得不度其「鴿籠式」生活者。則應减租以解其艱困。夫租無所謂減也。各物皆賤。房租獨貴。非事理之平。應隨一般物價而同時降。低方爲正辦。且房租昻貴之由來。（一）受民十信交潮流之激盪而房地價上漲。（二）因前數年金貴銀賤。藉口於進口建築材料之昂貴。（三）則房地產交易之投機白熱化。（四）則業主爲圖利益優厚故意注重建築上形式之新奇。以便索取高貴之租賃。因此僅有中產以上之階級。尙堪應付。其下無不受「高房租」之壓迫。今房租旣可因或種情形而增加於前。寗不可因或種情形而减低於後。卽爲業主計。欲圖房地產業之復活。斷非發行流通券設立交易所所能解决。必房地產有新價値。而後交易可以復活。此新價値之估定。又必自改訂房租始。蓋房租改訂能使一般有資力者認爲可保持其投資最低之利益。而後交易可望暢達。是則公允之减租。非但爲房客之福。抑亦業主之利。爲業主者誠宜忍一時之痛而作此久長計也。</p>

<h3 id="c81">粵省　製糖業之展望 <a href="#c81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>廣州通信粤省自施行糖業統制、卽設立糖廠、施行製糖工業以挽漏扈、自去年十二月市頭新造兩廠開工後、惠州二廠亦隨於一月間開工、對於過去榨煉及販售各情、多已散見報端、茲値榨蔗時期已過、今後關於本省糖業建設進行步驟究爲如何、以事屬生產事業、當爲一般社會人士所注意、記者昨特分別詳加調査作成有系統之概述、用響讀者、</p>
<p>整理糖廠</p>
<p>自本年四月底市頭新造兩糖廠將甘蔗榨完後、端積極從事修葺機械、並加以整理及改善、故一切工人並無停工、廠內機械自經改善後、將來開工則市頭廠可榨蔗超過一千噸以上、新造廠可榨蔗超過五百噸、蓋照前次最後榨蔗時期、市頭廠已可榨至千一百噸、新造廠亦可榨至六百噸、如再加此次停工時期之整理、將來成効增高自不待言、</p>
<p>開始煉糖</p>
<p>現在廠內已經開始煉糖、因在此時期無蔗可榨、而本省市面及國內各處均極需白糖、故本省政府特呈准財政部照章付稅運入原料糖以爲製煉原料、同時搜集本地土糖改煉、故市頭新造兩廠日來經已開工製煉白糖、以應本市及上海之需要、而此次製煉經加多些少機械可以製煉幼砂、現兩廠合計每日可出糖二千五百担、</p>
<p>改良蔗種</p>
<p>關於改良及蕃殖蔗種事務、數月來，均注重指導植蔗農家改良種蔗方法、及蕃殖優良蔗種、査去年運入優良蔗種千餘萬株、此項優良蔗種之產量、約比本地蔗種增加一倍以上、經一年來之試騐、知爪哇三二八七八及二八八三及二十二五與菲律濱種等蔗種、成績優佳、曾在番禺之三角洲及潮汕惠州一帶試種、結果皆比本地種多產一倍以上、現在本省種植此項蔗種之蔗田、面積約八千餘畝、足供十二萬畝蔗田蕃殖之用、在今年因優良蔗種未能盡量蕃殖、故所榨多爲本地蔗、如明年良蔗種　熟、便可全榨優良蔗、對於糖之成本約可輕一半、而農民之收穫又可增加一倍、此爲優良蔗種大規模蕃殖成功情形、</p>
<p>訂約購蔗</p>
<p>査兩糖廠去年訂約購蔗、全省各地大農呈報、而蔗田面積實際與呈報數目不相符合今年曾派出測量員三隊切實將各地定約蔗田測量、據報各地蔗田約七萬畝、但測量後約得實數五萬畝、故經此次之測量、農民不能以少報多、同時糖廠方面可以指導改良、而不足之數可以預早計算補購、此爲今年種蔗事務之改善者、</p>
<p>改善斬運</p>
<p>現在積極整理去年斬運甘蔗情形、査去年斬運甘蔗係批交商人或大蔗農辦理故工作不大妥善、往往斬運甘蔗不依日期及靈遲農民斬運、兼有勒索農民之嫌疑、現正設法切實取締、將來辦法、由農民自斬、由糖廠組織運輸部份代爲運輸、不再經大農之手、以免有從中欺壓小農事情、現各廠雖停工兩月以整理機械、惟各方面工作如貸欵種蔗改良蕃殖蔗種等事務、致各工作人員實無一刻閒暇、並且蔗種工作全年皆有、如在未榨蔗前對於植蔗改良蔗種、指導農民種蔗、整理運輸煉糖、調査蔗田、貸欵農民種蔗、分配肥料蔗種等事、異常複雜煩瑣、均須於此時期內辦理、一到榨蔗時期製糖工作方能迅速、</p>
<p>整頓惠廠</p>
<p>惠州軍墾糖廠、因去年所種爲本地蔗、復因受水浸災害、致品質不大優良、同時因斬運種種工作均屬初辦、及新機器安裝草率、工作人員不大熟練、故榨蔗方面略有窒碍、惟現正由檀香山公司負其全責、將機器修妥、至今年開工時准可榨至一千噸以上、該區改良蔗種亦大有成績，其新種每畝可出至三百餘擔、然現有蔗田面積甚少、不過四百畝、如能陸續蕃殖、除今年尙須再榨一年外、明年便可全榨優良蔗標、屆時利益尙可超過市造新頭兩廠、</p>
<p>籌備新廠</p>

<p>江蘇教育廳為提倡教育電影起見、曾於去年第一次公開徵求教育電影劇本、當經選定「小天使」劇、交由上海聯華擬成影片、成績頗　不惡、今年第二次徵求教育電影劇本、應徵者更較前踴躍、而蘇教廳對於應徵者的要求、已由僅須一簡單故事、進而為詳細分幕劇本劇本矣、故此次應徵作品、大抵均出自專家手筆、大有琳琅滿目、美不勝收之概、現統賽結果、其最後金錶、為文藝月刊總編輯王平陵君所撰之「慈母心」所得、聞該劇主旨、在敘說健全的母性教育影響兒童身心之重要、及母親為着兒子的前途種種奮鬥之經過、情節悲壯激昂、令人心感、蘇教廳為力求完密、曾請陳果夫氏詳細指示修改各點、因此、不特內容更見完美、而教育的意義、及戲劇的表現力、尤覺兼籌並顧、圓滿無缺云、</p>

<p>自北平市府主張男女分校以來、頗引起各地教育界人士之注意、上海社記者昨特趨訪國學名家胡樸安氏、詢以對於男女分校之意見、承發表談話如下、胡氏談、男女須同具學識、是現世的教育原則、我國男女同校經國家之制定、行之未久、進來頗有省市倡行分校制者、未得中央之核准、致引學校之反響、一鍋的學制因革、事關重大、必集三方面的合作精神、擁其損益輕重、而為從速同意的計劃、不宜有　形的施行、</p>
<p>名流的討論</p>
<p>現在言論自由凡為界名流、業於男女學制深為研究者、儘可發表高見於報章雜報、以供當軸採納、男女因體性不同、其於教學訓育兩要點、自有稍差、其主要學程可以共學、其有一部分科目如家政等、即在同校、似宜另設女子選科教室、以分教之、又女子體弱、其體育運動、亦當分別注意練習、此在事理上是有合校分校的討論、但必細察各地各校的學風、關於教學訓育衡其優劣、究竟適於合制分制何者之標準、以為取舍之根據、</p>
<p>省市的提案</p>
<p>省市廳局於地方情形較為切近、平時當常視察所屬學校、便細實況、更宜廣集名流輿論、以資參考、倘在管轄地內、或有風氣閉塞、如我國北方、有許多舊家庭固守陋習、如無女校寗願女子失學、則不妨從權、提案議決是部核准、分立女學、要在可能範圍內、以女子得收相當的教育為準則、如無特殊狀況、可仍舊貫、</p>
<p>國家的制定</p>
<p>我國財政艱難、民智淺陋、男女同校、殊為經濟、如行分制則經費支绌、各地女校或僅有或無有、是女子少有入學機會、而因男女同校易生流弊、覈集損益、即宜避重就輕、定為制度、則中央總覽一國政教、可採摘全國名宿言論的動向、及各省市呈案付之院部司員專加研談、必須審慎斟酌各地實情、或仍用合制、或改用分制、或合制分制參用、取其大多數的同議、集會通過、著為章程、須行全國以收政教統一之效、</p>

<p>— 美國奧爾珂德女士原著鄭曉滄（宗海）譯</p>
<p>乃德聽這一番話時，臉上漸漸光亮起來、因為，他的成績單雖然不長，卻已給他以甚大的精神鼓舞，使他覺得他也有幾徵的憑籍，不是一無所長的。「是，我卻能夠控制我的脾氣—這是我從父親杖下學來的；我能彈提琴，雖然我不知道唐努鳥　海在那裏」，他自想到，心中自有一種不能描狀的慰藉。然後他開口說着，說得那麼急切，所以竟被小橋聽見了。他說道：</p>
<p>「我確是要學，我決定去做。我從不進學校，但這不是我之過；加入他們不笑我，我猜想我必能進行的很佳妙的，—你和師母待我這麼好」。</p>
<p>小橋竟忘了一切，喊道，「他們不許笑你；加入他們笑了，我要—我　—通知他們不可以的」。</p>
<p>全　人停止了他們九九八十一的工作，個個人仰起頭來，看是什麼一回事。</p>

<p>— 闌删</p>
<p>在左手無名指上帶上了一隻赤金訂婚戒，亂動了不少時候的心房如今是平定起來了。雖然說是平定，却仍有一種飄飄然之威，想到將來的快活日子，在心裏皺起了一陣屬於輕狂的波動，臉上不由得掛上一道淺笑了。</p>
<p>這原是幸福的，帶上了這隻戒指之後，世界之上有一個女郞是屬於你的了，便是你自己，也同是屬於那個女郞。</p>
<p>想想以前吧，當伊不曾答應你的婚事時，你是怎麼樣的不安寗呢？生怕伊會給別人搶了去，生怕伊的名字不能和你的此肩排列，在報章上以鉛字印了出來，宣佈你的成功。但如今伊是爲你所有了，你的憂慮可以告一段落了。</p>
<p>如果伊同時給幾個男子所追求，而結果仍然是你的俘獲者，那末你便是這一場情戰的勝利國，你臉上的光輝眞可與指上的金戒互爲輝映，額外的威風神氣</p>
<p>當休沐之餘，可以挽着伊的臂膀，在最熱閙的馬路上兜兩個圈子，讓那些單身的靑年男女看着你們，致其不相干的拓忌或者羨慕的「注目禮」。</p>
<p>人生最可貴的才是訂婚的時候，一結了婚時，你的好夢漸醒了。你在訂婚時所想像到的未來的生活，是美妙甜蜜的，是充滿詩意的。夫妻之間要怎樣的體貼溫存，愛撫安慰。但在結婚以後，世間能有幾對恩愛夫妻？你得儘量享受你的訂婚生活，訂婚了之後，更不要急圖結婚，我是這樣的希望着那些已訂了婚的靑年男女，却是聽不聽由你。（我的意思以爲像這樣的好夢，應該讓它延長一點，你急於結婚，無非想把這好夢破壞掉而已。）</p>
<p>因爲自己最近訂了婚，心裏有諸般感想，又恐怕自己急於要破壞這好夢，便胡亂的寫了這一篇，用以自儆，並吿許多帶了訂婚戒指的人們。</p>
<p>讓我們在這好夢裏多留幾個年頭吧！</p>

<p>秋蟲的種類最多，前人說；「以蟲鳴秋，」這句話，的確是不錯；你看天氣還未交秋就有叫哥哥聒聒兒出現，做這種生意的人，挑了一副擔在街頭停著，靠這小小的蟲類吃飯，據說；都是從鎭江一帶販來的，倘然是山東產的，那末；他的鳴聲，還要響咧！其實這種鳴聲，有什麽好聽？况且天時愈熱，他的聲音也愈響，咦！歡喜養的人們，非但不覺得討厭，反說；聽了，是能够淸暑的，吾眞有些不懂。</p>
<p>現在已交了秋，若在晚凉的時候，坐於階前，遠遠裏聽到織布娘和搖紗郞，兩種的聲音（這兩種蟲，是吾們嘉定人的俗稱，）可以使人想起「一女不織，或受之寒」的道理，因爲他的鳴聲，狠像在那裏搖紗織布，可惜眼前農村中的手工業，眞比不上他的辛勤呢！至於其它像的鈴子，（分天的鈴地的鈴二種，一爲靑色，一爲灰色，）和茉莉子，講究的，且拿玻璃來黏成極巧妙的匣子，把它養進，天的鈴原來屬陰的，一到了夜，他就非常活動，　起了兩翅，磨戞而鳴，這種音，確是淸越可聽，苿莉雖小，置在案頭，你若翻書吟誦的當兒，他的音，尤覺幽靜，更其是不斷的助你淸興，所以秋蟲，不好說是一無可取啊</p>
<p>不過像蟋蟀一類，（吾們嘉定叫他爲暫蝍，）同樣是秋蟲，你說他是性質不同，喂！照動物學家講；能够發出美的鳴聲，都是雄的，他因爲追求雌轟，想蕃殖的緣故，並沒有要人來飼養的道理，豈料人偏會利用地當個賭博的工具，被人一根牽草，左右一撥，勝的儘管吱吱的鳴得震天饗，敗的像落花流水，默不作聲，眞是好看：實在蟋蟀自己不曉得被人愚弄，最爲可憐；唉！豈祗秋蟲是這樣，吾看世界上做這個迷夢的，也不少呢！</p>

<p>靑菜的消毒法我們日常所吃的各種靑菜，常常爲消化器傳染病的媒介，因為栽培蔬菜，多澆灌人糞肥料，所以菜葉菜根，附有很多的傳染病菌。」在鄉間的農家，割了菜後，都在溪流他塘中草草的洗滌，就挑到都會裏來賣了。如烹煮時，經過了洗濯，加以煮沸而食，比較少危險。然而有幾種蔬菜，是生食物，也有未經完全煮沸的，那末，附于菜葉上的傳染病菌，就有大害了。我們如要放心，最好把靑菜消毒，消毒的方法，是用晒粉。（即克羅爾石灰）CaloariaChlorala晒粉爲白色，有鹽索氣味，溶于水變爲赤色。這粉的有效成分，以二〇·二五％分解于水時，才發揮其消毒力。因分解而生消毒性物質，容易酸化（例如有機物與阿爾加里性的東西）所以用晒粉水洗後，仍舊要再用淸水洗凈，那末，旣可消除有機物，而且可以洗去晒粉的氣味。</p>
<p>洗衣的簡單方法　洗濯衣服，依質地而不同，夏季所穿的衣服，多爲白色的綢縐，洗染店裏洗濯綢衣，是用漂白蒸洗，可是在普通的家庭中，那就很不便了。現在有一種很簡便的方法，用溫水一面盆，溶解洗　蘇打二瓢，把衣服浸透，那來，齷齪的東西，容易脫落，過了一二小時，用手梢搓，取出紋乾，再用洗衣皂粉泡在開水中，把衣服浸了一小時，取出用板刷緩緩刷去汚跡。如有黃汚的跡，那要用漂白法，就是用漂白粉一瓢，冷水二合溶解，就在黃汚部分浸後，汚跡易落。倘若全件綢色巳黃，譬如紡綢，穿得過久，色要變黃，那要用冷水二升，漂白粉二瓢，重曹一瓢混合，溶化浸洗。但紗布類的衣服，不官漂白的。印度綢與稀薄的絹縐，可用重曹一瓢，上等洗濯皂粉一瓢，先浸洗後，再川蓚　一瓢，醋酸二十滴，加水一合洗濯，又用哈特爾沙爾飛脫Hydrosalfit藥粉二瓢，醋酸五六滴，開水二升浸泡，等質地巳純白，取出再用淸水漂淸。</p>
<p>白皮鞋刷新法　大凡皮鞋的皮面，塗有白色琺瑯質Enamel的，買進時，先搽以水油，那末可防皺裂，而且皮亦柔軟，過了一三四日，再用醋揩拭。但有顏色的皮鞋經醋一揩就要變色，如鞋面黏着齷齪的東西，那可先用汽油揩凈。不過穿白皮鞋，最要注意的，一旦有汚點，應當早早收拾，切不可放置。若有汚泥的跡，先用鞋刷刷去泥汚，或用橡皮膠擦摩，再用肥皂水洗滌乾凈，塗以白粉，等到乾燥，再用硬毛鞋刷遍擦。普通白皮鞋的鞋面，多用白羊皮，白鹿皮，白麂皮所製的，總以不使過于齷齪，洗刷搓擦，亦比較容易。</p>

<p>我父親所說的當然是好話：但在我那時候的心目中看來，父親這個人委實是太古派了些，什麽事情都不敢大意，我自己倒是一些也不担心事，很有把握地知道我的頭决不會給太后割下，因爲我深信那些法國染髮藥是絕對不致毫無功效的。可是隔了許久之後，我的經騐旣多，便漸漸覺悟了，知道我這一種行動的確是等於引火燒身，一個碰得不好，端的會敎腦袋搬家。</p>

<h3 id="c213">文學上偶然論的抬頭（東京通信） <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 虹影</p>
<p>最近的日本文壇上，廣汎地進行着「偶然論」的論爭。引起這論爭的原因，是兩個主要的事實所致起的：第一，是所謂文學的「純粹性」或「通俗性」的問題，即要使文學不失其爲文學的「純粹性」，不流於無聊的「通俗文學」之途，而又得富有大衆的興味；第二，是浪漫主義的問題，即鑑於機械的呆板的寫實主義之枯燥，要求活躍的表現。（這巳由一些人擁片岡鐵兵爲首，結成「社會浪漫派」了。）這兩個問題，有一個共通點，即同是要「趣味化」。在討論這「趣味化」的時候，問題的焦點，便移到「偶然性」上來了。</p>
<p>差不多每個活動的評論家，作家，都被捲入了這「偶然論」之論爭的漩渦裏。問題的對象雖則是在文學上，然而涉及的範圍，則有哲學，物理學，統計學等等。在論爭中各人的意見雖均有出入，但從本質上區別起來，可以歸納成兩大類，在這兩大類中再分成各小類。</p>
<p>第一類代表者有橫光利一，中河與一，石原純，片岡鐵兵的見解也可以歸入於此流；第二類的代表者是繼承以前藏原惟人，川口浩的理論系統的森山啟，荻原中，以及戶坂潤的一部分見解。</p>
<p>橫光利一以爲現在的日本通俗文學，有兩個要素：一個是訴諸感傷性，一　是利用偶然性。他主張今後純粹的通俗文學，應該棄去前一要素！感傷性，而採用後者—偶然性。他說：「純粹小說中的偶然（一時性或特種性），或是由構成那小說的大部分的日常性（必然性或普遍性）之集中。所當然發生的特種運動的畸形部：或是把以前的日常更弄得强度，使那偶然有發生之可能，使那偶然發生了。如果偶然脫去了這兩者中之一而出現在作品上，則所表現的偶然，一定變爲傷感。」橫光利一是所謂自由主義的文人，所以他的見解相當的敏銳，他在這裏把偶然性與必然性之本質的關係的一部分，透徹地說明了。然而他只以爲偶然是必然的集中，而不知道必然是偶然的集中。他認必然性爲一種日常性，否認必然性可以成爲別的高度的表現之可能。</p>
<p>中河與一的偶然論，具體的主張包括在六月號「新潮」上他的「偶然文學論」裏。這篇東西篇幅雖是短短的幾頁，却從物理學，哲學，文學上引來了十四五位名家，而自己陷入於形式論理的泥沼中。石原純的偶然論比較有系統的意見。他是從「新量子力學的認識論」及其統計的方法，一直說到「統計學的思維」（即物理學社會科學上的統計現象），由此建立他的偶然論的。</p>
<p>「新量子力學」以爲電子或光，是粒子同時是波動，要同時正確地求出其位置與速度，是不可能的。電子攪亂了測定的系中的從來力學的因果性，要測定該純粹的系中的位置與速度，也是不可能的；因此不能以因果律推測未來。在　這裏，「新量子力學」就產生了因果律的否定。石原純把因果律當做必然性，因而以爲且不能　由這因果律去推知的，就是偶然性。這是「新量子學的不可知論」。他又說統計學的思考　者，認爲在這偶然的堆積上有「蓋然」存在，而要從學問的世界趕出因果律和必然的概念。學問是跟蹤着「蓋然的世界」的，「凡此所不能蓋盡的偶然的世界，早巳屬於科學範圍之外」，「我們應以此爲文學的主題。」石原純在這裏設下了學問與藝術之間的不可跳越的認識論的境界綫，提倡以因果律所不能追及的心理爲主題的文學。然而，這種文學只是「瘋癲院的文學，是紛然雜踏的未來派文學，是感傷的狂想曲之混唱」罷了。石原純的這種主張，正是代表近代害怕歷史的必然性的少數人的社會意識。</p>
<p>片岡鐵兵的偶然論是一種常識的偶然論，他的偶然的意義，是表示「不意」，「不能豫期的」惹思。他舉例道，某天在車裏碰到一個舊友——漂亮的女人，「小說就從此開始了。如果　有這個偶然，則一切其他的任何日常性，都不能有意義。」這種常識上的偶然，完全是主觀的觀念的存在，而不是客觀的實在。</p>
<p>其次說到第二類的見解了。在一九三一年，國際的對於偶然性的問題，還沒有淸楚的眉目的時候，藏原惟人便正確地說過。。「對於）個體系（或過程）不是本質的東西，便是那過程的偶然。」譬如歐洲大戰，是由於塞爾維亞的一個靑年槍殺奧國的太子所引起的，這件事對於帝國主義的戰爭，是一個偶然。即使沒有這個偶然，那戰爭也要通過別的偶然而爆發的。</p>
<p>川口浩更接受這成果，說：「必然的東西與偶然的東西結合，表現爲現象的表面。」必然通過偶然而發現，偶然轉化爲必然。</p>
<p>森山啟更把這輝論發展了。把偶然的意義，職務及作用，指示出來。他指出偶然的客觀性，及其使歷史速進或遲延的作用。戶坂潤，萩原中等以爲這次所謂偶然論也者，乃是「可能性及現實之問題」，「現實主義乃至浪漫主義的必要的範疇，不是什麽偶然性，而是現實性的可能性及現實的自由。」這話是頗扼要的。</p>

<p>— 胡依凡</p>
<p>日子飛快地過去，已經是快要二個月了，我沒有寫上三篇文章。</p>
<p>「這怎麼得了呢！光陰虛擲成績毫無，何况自家還要過日子的呀！」</p>
<p>三回四次地我那麽地鞭策着自己。</p>
<p>我拿出了無比的勇氣踞坐到寫字台前，命令着自己握起了筆管夾在指端，從我的心的深處喊出：</p>
<p>「寫呀！努力寫呀！爲什麽不寫下去呢？」</p>
<p>我拿着一支鋼筆呆呆地坐在了寫字台前，時間一分鐘一分鐘很快地溜過去，台子上的原稿紙，依然是一張白紙。憂鬰的腦子，像塗上了石灰似地，把每個窮眼都弄得　住了。</p>
<p>翻來覆去地，我終於寫不出一個字兒來。</p>
<p>「沉重而呆板呀！廢物的腦神經呀！」</p>
<p>我祇會那麽地又來詛咒着自己。</p>
<p>現在的環境是再冷靜沒有了：房裏也從來沒有像今天早上般的和平。孩子們一點聲息都沒有，母親也困睡在床上厄自呼呼地打鼾。外面的天地，是連小販的叫賣聲也絕響了。僅有的擾攘，就是那籬笆外的嚅嚅的蛙聲，和鄰居花園裏矮樹小枝上的鳥唱；那是來調劑這次苦悶的空氣的呀，還能够破發我的文思！那，爲什麽我又寫不下去呢？</p>
<p>我深深透了口氣放下了筆來，夾了一支香烟在手指兒上，又整理了幾下散亂的頭髮。暗中，我還想皷舞着我的靈思。</p>
<p>「小說，散文，雜感，我還是寫什麼好例！」</p>
<p>我的思路一點也沒有組織着，厄自千頭萬緒不知打那兒寫起好。我把香烟來回地調換了手，身子上上下下地在寫字台邊動作着。我俯下了頭頸又欠伸了起來，我拿起了筆管，又把它放下。</p>
<p>一支烟捲燒完了，飛快地我接聯又燃上了一支。到實在寫不出一個字來的時候，我就索性玩弄着烟圈。眞作怪，今天是連烟圈也玩不出來了，我賭氣地把大半截的烟捲　的一聲摔入了痰盂內。</p>
<p>我又接聯燃上了它一支。</p>
<p>可是原稿紙上依然是沒有一個字兒呀！</p>
<p>烟士披利純今天眞不興呀！</p>
<p>我直着雙眼對着空白的原稱紙發怔？我皺起了眉頭，拍，我又摔下了筆。</p>
<p>「爲什麼我又一定要寫這撈什子咧？做別的事不能幹嗎？可詛咒的無靈魂的文字生涯」</p>
<p>恨起來的時候，我就自暴自棄地這樣來了個决心。</p>
<p>「索性，把書架子上那些撈什子干脆也丟光了算了。」</p>
<p>但一轉眼我看到旁邊小榻上孩子們天眞無邪的笑臉，那母親，正欠了個身子，眼睛圈裏透露出昨晚半夜裏還興奮地坐起來寫作，從過分勞累裏帶來的隱隱的黑暈，我又深深地感受到一點刺激。</p>
<p>「我不能那樣羅曼蒂克呀！爲什麽我就不能寫作？」</p>
<p>我立刻糾正了自己，把勇氣重新拿了出來。</p>
<p>呲，我又把大半截烟捲摔掉了，重新又拿起了筆。</p>
<p>可是寫什麼好咧？小說？散文？抑雜感？連題目今天我都還沒有想出一個呀！我一接觸到這之上，我更煩亂了。</p>
<p>我又抽起了烟捲，放下了筆，腦子裏像重重地塞住了滿頭都是石灰，沒有一　通氣。</p>
<p>我把過去的雖不豐富，也並不十分貧乏的體騐也慢慢糢糊起來，甚至要定全忘記掉了。</p>
<p>現實，我與它又是那麽老遠隔離着。</p>
<p>寫什麼好呢？我眞有點替自巳悲哀了。腐銹的生活呀！</p>

<p>— S．爾塞吉夫·晋斯基作蘇明譯</p>
<p>第一個星期他過得並不壞。他用他的斧頭整天的工作，趁尋還不太深的時候，弄了木頭，準備過長春的冬天。他還燻乾了一些魚，在天氣太冷不能冒險出去的情形下。他做了一柄剷子，來淸除河流的冰塊上的雪。他的斧頭成了他的最好的一個朋友，和他的網跟來福槍一道。火在洞裏燒得很旺，他是這樣的快樂，他開始想起那學校敎員亞洛沙來，有時甚至大聲的說：「在這樣一間房間裏，兩個人能够好好的過活。」但他一定要加一句，「要是她沒有一個紅的頭和一顆黑的心。」</p>
<p>一天早上，當他開開門的時候（遇了有大量地積物的情形之下，門總是向裏不是向外開的。）他驚駭到跳了起來。正在門前，隱藏在松樹下面，蹲着一隻碩大的狼，　備撲向他的喉。沙瓦卡好容易砰的一下把門關上了。他攫取了他的槍。當他冉開開門的時候，拍的一，那隻狼還是站在那裏，是一隻母狼，一隊狼的頭領。他第一槍就打死了牠，但是在下面，在松樹底下，站着整隊的狼在噑呌着。牠們有的在退向河流邊上去，沙瓦卡注意到了他晚上是被深林裏的一大隊狼所包圍了。</p>
<p>他把死狼的皮帶進洞裏，但是他現在祗有帶了來福槍才敢出去捉魚，他知道狼一經發覺了樹林裏有一個人，是再不肯放棄的。兩天以後，實在的，牠們跟了他到河流那裏，牠們有不下一打之多·沙瓦卡在牠們跑開之前放了兩次槍。他的洞裏現在多出了兩張狼皮。他把屍體拋下在雪地上·在第一個晚上，牠們就被剩下的狼羣呑　了，正像他以前打死的一隻一樣。</p>
<p>就這樣，開始了繼續到整整一個冬天的打獵—一種兩方面的打獵，狼獵著沙瓦卡，沙瓦卡獵著牠們。在冬天，他一共弄到了九張狼皮。但是他不再走得離洞太遠，他的滑雪鞋也躺在角落裏沒用了。間或運氣好，他會在洞的近旁捉到一隻　鴣，於是就可以稍稍停止一下捉魚的工作。</p>
<p>接著開始沒有白天，祇有暗晦了。洞裏除了狼的呼嘯，大貓　　的偶然的啼呌，和時時有大風雪的咆哮以外，就一點聲息都沒了。沙瓦卡隨身帶了一本筆記簿，要想寫點甚麽的。但是他寫得很壞，簡直像畫畫，所以他把這些潔凈的紙都消耗在紙煙上。加以，實在沒有什麽要寫的。一個洞終於是一個洞，冬天像所有的冬天一樣，狼就像狼，樹林祇是一座樹林，河流也跟其他的河流沒有兩樣—實在還有什麽要寫的呢？</p>

<p>— 葉紫</p>
<p>母親慈悲相地將孩子包好，送到產婦的身邊，一邊用毯子蓋着，一邊對她說：</p>
<p>「快到九江了，你好好地看着這孩子……恭喜你啊！是一個好看的小姑娘哩！……我們就去替你想辦法的。……」</p>
<p>產婦似乎淸醒了一些，睜開着悽凉的蘿葡花的眼睛，感激地流出了兩行眼淚。</p>
<p>在統艙和房艙里（但不能跑到官艙間去）母親用了眞正的慈善家似的臉相，叫我端着一個盤子，同着她向搭客們普遍地寡起捐來。然而，結果是大失所望。除了一兩個人肯丟下一張當一角或兩角的鈔票以外，剩下來的僅僅是一些銅元；一數，不少不多，剛剛合得上大洋一元三角。</p>
<p>母親深沉地嘆着氣說：「做好事的人怎麼這樣少啊！」從幾層的紙包里，換出自己僅僅多餘的一元錢來，凑了上去。</p>
<p>「快到九江了！」母親再次走到艘後，將銅板角票和洋錢捏在手中，對產婦說：「這里是二元多錢，你可以收藏一點，等等賬房先生來時你自己再對他說，給他少一點，求他將你帶到蕪湖！……當然，」母親又補上去一句：「我也可以巷你帮忙說一說的……」</p>
<p>產婦勉强地掙起半邊身子，流着眼淚，伸手戰慄地接着錢鈔，放在毯子下。但是，母親却突然地望着那掀起的毯子角落，大聲地呼呌了起來：</p>
<p>「怎麽！你的孩子？……」</p>
<p>那女人慌張而且惶懼地一言不發，讓眼淚一滴趕一滴地順着腮邊跑將下來，沉重地打落在毯子上。</p>
<p>「你不是將她拋了嗎？你這狠心的女人！」</p>
<p>「我，我，我………」她嚅嚅地，悲傷地低著頭，終於什麽都說不出。</p>
<p>母親好久好久地站立着！眼睛釘着江岸，釘着那緩緩地爬過來的，九江的繫華底街市而不作聲。浪花在船底哭泣着，翻騰着！——不知道從哪一個泡沫里，捲去了那一個無辜的，　弱的靈魂……</p>
<p>「觀世音娘娘啊！我的天啊！一條性命啊……」</p>
<p>茶房們又跑來了，這一回是奉了賬房先生的命令，要將她趕上岸去的。他們兩個人不說情由地將她拖着，一個人替她捲着我們給她的那條弄滿血汚的毯子。</p>
<p>船停了。</p>
<p>母親的全部慈善事業完全落了空。當她望着茶房們一面拖着那產婦拋上岸去，一面拾着地上流落的銅板和洋錢的時候，她幾乎哭了起來。（完）</p>

<p>— 仃</p>
<p>倘有必要和可能的話，那就請你把我過去給你留下的日記及許多的書簡展開來讀一下吧。我想：這對于你是有益的。</p>
<p>我盼求你能够虛心地仔細地去讀它。那麽在我的話里，你自然會找尋得着當中所包涵的一切底意義。而對於你的誤會我，不理解我底程度不致會弄到像今天那樣可悲的地步吧！</p>
<p>吿訴你：我這四五年間的生活底血痕，我所受到的痛苦與磨折，那八間的殘酷的，沉痛的，沒有人性的事情我都遭遇過了。雖然在我的身上刻劃着各種各樣的傷痕，但這確是作爲鼓動我，勉勵我掙扎唯一之標記。在我的心中沒有殘敗的種子，沒有餒怯的質分，沒有對於「生」感到無望的悲哀！我，仍舊一樣充滿着求生的灼熱底欲望，仍舊一樣擁塞着亢昂與憤慨。對於黑暗和腐朽中的社會，對於我們生存着這個「災禍」的世界，我，和大家一樣努力地去毀滅它，爲着千千萬萬人的幸福及自由啊！</p>
<p>總之，我的理想，我的為為，和平日對你那種垣然而無邪的愛撫之心，做了我多年眞摯的友好的你，想應該會明瞭吧</p>
<p>但，我們之間的隔膜宛如一條鴻溝似地。</p>
<p>這是爲了什麽緣故我們會有像今次那樣可怕的事情發生哩</p>
<p>對于這解答，我感覺不幸。</p>
<p>想剷我們有六七年悠長歷史的友誼底中斷，為了我，曾聽到朋友譽過：你因此感到生的乏味，對於人事頓起灰心冷志之念。回憶着你的爲人，體味着你這顆心，着實深深堆使我感到無限的楚痛之悽凉。</p>
<p>吿訴你，由於過一段生活的過程中，我曾下了很大的功夫去觀察你。我發覺你的多和狹量，你的自私和傲慢，你的理想和觀念，你的對於我過份的盲目的愛，這就是做成我們之間的悲劇的泉源。</p>
<p>前天又聽到D君說。。你因爲受着種種的壓迫，刺激，和不滿於現狀的生活，居然自殺了。徼倖沒有成功。但這眞令我多麼悚然，駭然啊！</p>
<p>你爲什麽想到這樣懦弱的田地呢？你以爲死了——這樣白白地死了會引起人們對於你的同情嗎？這樣會終結了你困窘的命運嗎？這樣可以擺脫了這萬惡的，卑汚的人間嗎？</p>
<p>不。這樣想是錯誤的。人間的罪惡幷不因你之死而會减少。黑暗仍舊籠罩着我們的週圍。痛苦仍舊緊緊地追隨着你。</p>
<p>不要那樣痴吧，他們將以嘲笑的態度來對待你。而你只是白白地，無意義的，無價値的像一條狗子一樣，被躱在穴里，你甘心嗎？你肯犧牲自己賣貴的生命嗎？</p>
<p>這是不値得的。而且，那是多麼愚蠢的事！</p>
<p>每每感觸到這些事上面，在我的心中便撩起激烈的慘痛。想到溫味着你對我的體貼之關心是出於你對我一種至誠的愛時，做了你忠實的知心的有益的朋友之我，對於你的前途，應該負起如何重大的責任啊。</p>
<p>奮鬥吧，從血泊中去求生存！</p>
<p>對於自己的生命不要去作孤注之一擲。</p>
<p>大地雖然充塞着無窮的慘痛底呻吟，</p>
<p>但在其中，你將會聽到悅耳之聲音，</p>
<p>那是偉大的生命的交響樂，幸福就是寄托在這當中啊！</p>

<p>— 行安</p>
<p>近年來我國旅外僑胞，也跟祖國的遭受國難，到處給外人欺凌。被下令驅逐的，已一批批如喪家之犬的回到祖國來。還寄居在國外的，不時都要受盡無理的壓迫。這一次荷印的發生華僑與土人械鬥，僑胞的生命財產，更覺岌岌可危。但我國旅外僑胞的痛苦，不僅經濟方面受人排擠而已，卽連讀書看報的自由，也要遭人干涉。前此暹羅政府的實行取締華僑學校，强迫華僑學校敎授暹文，及禁止中國報紙雜誌入口，可謂極盡壓迫之能事。新加坡當局，近日也有取締華僑學校應用中國課本之舉。及至最近，荷屬西婆羅洲政府，更是變本加厲，竟欲定期焚燬華文書籍。凡這種種倒行逆施，不惟有妨害華僑的敎育，抑且有侮辱中國的體面。旅外華僑讀中國書報，本是應有的權利。外人必欲橫施干涉，實屬奪人自由。</p>
<p>査外人的限制我國僑胞閱讀中國書報，其用意的惡劣，殊深値得注意。例如這一回荷屬西婆羅洲政府的實行取締華文課本，原因爲發見坤甸善牧學校敎員所改的學生作文內，有若干篇被認爲「失檢」，「字句激烈」，「含有政治上挑撥」，「離間民族的惡意」，故當局便認爲違反當地法律，决定予以焚燬，這種舉動，未免做得過於不合理。聞華僑聯合會據報後，異常憤慨，將有所表示。但我們要怎樣表示呢？這須有一種切實的方法，才能抵制。</p>

<p>— 尼</p>
<p>看着中天里滿圓晶瑩皎潔的月亮吹着習習輕快的凉風，腦海里驀地里就浮泛起珠江夜月的幽美的景象來。的確的，它曾經陶醉過我的童稚的心，消磨過我的一部分很可寳貴的靑春！那兒，怎不使我懷戀，永恒地懷戀呢？雖則我巳負起了繁累的家的重任，踅着沈重的脚步，向飄茫而又帶着辛酸的味道兒的人生的旅程邁進，離開了曾經陶醉過我的童稚的心的幽美的珠江風月好多辰光，然而，它的謐靜的美景，寬闊蜿蜓的河面，大鏡子般的平滑，輕盈，碧綠的淸波，船樓畫舫里面的「春色」，以及河的兩岸靑翠欲滴飄逸逸的荔枝園林，……這一切美麗的姿態，却深深印留在我的這顆殘傷的心窩里，每當玉盤似的月亮懸掛在深藍色的天空里的時候，我底殘傷破碎心窩兒，就彷彿刮起了一陣狂大的風，掀起了無數的漣漪的波浪，迴想起過去的歡樂，和現在的潦倒，凄凉，珠江風月的陳蹟，舊情，都給俏媚晶潔的月亮的笑容勾撩起來了。</p>
<p>現在又正是嶺南的榴花正茂，荔枝子兒巳紅的季節了呵！在這吹拂灼炎的薰風的大毒熱天里，人，像熱帶里的蛇般的疲倦，棉市（廣州）的人們一定會感到溽暑的可畏而給牠逼迫到珠江的河面上來，於是，東郊西郊的游泳塲又開始地不會覺得冷淸，寂寞，而鬧哄哄地翻騰着許多健美的哥兒們和娘兒們了。我認識「珠江夜月」的嫻靜幽美的姿態的景色，是在幾年前的一個吠着驚熱的南風的夏天里，那時，我剛從南洋初次回歸祖國來。每當黃昏時分，太陽收斂了牠的熱毒的光芒，靜悄悄地，懶散散地鑽沈到河的西岸的荔枝園林的背後去了的時候，於是，這一泓淸碧寬闊，蜿蜓曲折的珠江的一曲曲小小的支流的荔枝灣的西郊，在凉爽的晚風的溫柔的飄拂里，格外地覺得縹緻，秀美，而又充滿着羅曼司的氛氣。那時節，我的天眞無邪的心坎里，眞不知道人世間有所謂辛，酸，苦，澀的味道兒存在，我的整個的心身，都沈醉在這幽麗的景色美人兒似的胸懷里去了。當月亮團　的晚夜，靜謐的珠江的澄碧的流水，點綴着萬點閃爍燦爛的皎潔的銀光，這時，我總喜歡偕着幾個知友，租了一葉輕快的小舟欵乃乃地，動盪到江心里，坐在船艙重，微閉着眼睛，靜聆着船底下發出來沙沙的輕微而有節拍的流水的激蕩聲，或兩岸的畫舫的樓頭上給人摟抱在懷里的艇娘的低廻淸脆的小調歌兒，這倒也是一種別有風趣的賞心樂事的玩意兒哩！如果酒興來時，不妨沽幾斤「靑梅」，和買一些應時水菜，一面對酒當歌，一面欣賞中天晶瑩皎潔的珠江夜月，任憑小舟跟流水飄流下去，等到酒意闌珊達到飄飄然的境地，那也無妨引吭高歌，大開喉嚨，來一套沒調兒的吟哦「濃」唱吧，倘使喉嚨嘶啞或是口喝的時候，也可以捨舟登陸，在堤岸的花園式的飲泳室里，隨便來一杯刨冰，潤潤嗓音：萬一肚子覺得有點饑餓，而又懶上西關去吃點心，江心里自有著名的「艇仔粥」，可以任憑你吃個淋漓痛快了。這些充分地渲染着羅曼司的氣氛的悠閒美麗的情景，雖則隔絕了好多年頭，而又象着繁累的生活邁進了人生的旅途，然而，那些，却還淸淸楚楚地印留在殘碎的心旌里，永恒地懷念着呵！</p>
<p>當我憶起幽美的「珠江夜月」的時候，心坎里就有點兒酸溜溜了。呵，我已邁進了茫茫的人生的征途。</p>

<p>— 艾荼</p>
<p>從公益的火車站跨上了三等車廂里，讓火車瘋狂了似的載着我向南方奔着。那是早晨，太陽帶着處女似的溫柔和含羞底氣息在東方的竹林梢間或高山的谷中透出了紅嫩的光芒。那是美麗而可愛的，而且蘊藏着深濃的鄉村的樸實的氣息。又好像無邪的孩子似的張着嘴巴在微笑。</p>
<p>火車是瘋狂了似的響着隆隆的調子。鐵的輪子跟長蛇似的軌道相輾轉的聲音，把旅人的耳朶震動得要聾了一樣難聽的。</p>
<p>從車廂的窗子外邊，可以眺望到一片碧綠的平野，茸茸的草在飄蕩著，高山上，除了叢密的林子間透出來的彩色，就是疏疏密密的藏着死人的骷髏的山墳，沉默地蹲座在山峯間，這，不論什麽地方，我們都可以看得見這樣的陳跡，看得出南方人對於他們底祖先的崇奉和敬孝的。然而，這些樣子，在火車里的我只能用淡淡的眼光掠了過去，一點也沒有感想到什麽的。</p>
<p>只是遊子的思念着自己底家的心情特別慫恿着。</p>
<p>這時，我想起了我底古舊的家。古舊底家正是凄凉地在那破落的村子里矗立着，可憐的媽媽正在張大了眼睛的等候着多年在外流浪的兒子底回去。是的，我不會忘記，我很久以前離開她的時候是那察倥惚的，悄悄地逃出了可怕的圈子里。</p>
<p>然而，現在我回去是做什麽呢？可</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>憐的家還能够給我留戀的餘地嗎？不！不！我憎恨着黑漆的家鄕，從小就憎恨着家鄉了，然而，我却戀愛着可憐的老母，她不是白髮蒼蒼的，眉額上不是躺着許多皺紋嗎？她不是愛着她底年輕的兒子嗎？</p>
<p>想着，我底心情就不知不覺的緊張而難過了起來了。</p>
<p>迅速的，那髙山和綠水，一片一片的在我的眼睛里掠了過去了。</p>
<p>到了家鄉的一個火車站的時侯，太陽正是帶着處女似的鮮艷底彩色，溫柔地歡迎着遊子的歸家。下了火車，那車站還是跟多年前不兩樣的，只不過是多建築了兩座新的洋房子，從火車站的正面望過去的一個湖，深深的，白茫茫的水波反照着美麗的太陽光，湖水的邊岸上的蘆葦草是長長的，給風吹得輕輕地飄盪着。我一看見這樣的景色就想起了還是天眞活潑的小孩子底時候，不是常常赤着腿兒在這淺水的湖上捕魚捉蝦，有時還躲在湖里的蘆葦草上遊戲嗎？——那是過去的了，現在當然是慕羨着的，因此，當一些跟我不認識的小孩子歪着小腦袋來瞧望着我的時候，不禁地又咒咀着自己：「啊！流浪了這許多日子，又得到什麽來供給故鄉呢？」慚愧的呵！只是滿身可怕的創傷吧！</p>
<p>離開了火車站，拖着腿兒向自己的村子里回去的時候，又看見村子的竹林的枝葉在搖晃着，透出來颼颼的聲音，似乎太息，又似乎刺諷我的一樣。然而，我終是大胆的跨進了自己的古舊的家底門檻了。</p>
<p>家里死般沉寂的，地面似乎生滿了靑色的苔，那陰黝得很的房子里透出了冷靜的氣息，給遊蕩歸來的兒子威到傷悲的：「小孩子時候的家那里去了？這里太凄凉的呀！」不錯，我記得很淸楚，小孩子的時候我們幾個兄弟都在不知悲哀似的高笑與跳躍着的。如今，可憐的古舊的家，已浸進了沒有太陽光的圈子里了。</p>
<p>龍鍾的老母跑了出來，那突然的歸來的兒子給她一種驚喜，眼眶里就湧出了快樂的淚來了：</p>
<p>「呵！你歸來了，我做夢也夢着你歸來了！」</p>
<p>是的，她總是這樣做夢地等候着兒子的歸來的，當她那異樣的臉孔煽動了我底心情的時候，我只得太息似地說了一句不能安慰她的傷創的話：</p>
<p>「是的！媽媽，我是平安地歸來了！」</p>
<h3 id="c222">三先生 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 二郎</p>
<p>三先生在鄉民的眼光看來雖然是一位洋翰林，可是他一向在外頭並沒有做過官，只是當大學敎務長大學敎授之類的學界職業，這一次暑假回家，鄉民却將他當做「衣錦歸故鄉」的大事看，道喜送禮閙了好幾天，簡直將他比較鄕長大先生還看得髙，有人還公開的宣傳道，「三先生如今榮歸，我們應該選他做鄉長，大家才有體面呢」。</p>
<p>這日大先生到城裏去，村裏發生一伴攔路搶刦謀財害命的案子，大家將那匪徒合事主一齊押到三先生家裏來，說道，「三先生說一句就是一句，想怎麽辦就怎麽辦，不必等大先生回來了」。擲民這樣推票敬服的。可是，等到問明案情，事主却不願作原吿，只乞從速了結，這就使三先生躊躇起來了。案情是這樣發生的：——</p>
<p>村頭那賣香烟小店子的老板從城內買到二十來條香烟，托推小車的老大回家順便帶一帶，不料老大推小車推到半路上，被一個漢子用棍子將他打暈，刦了香烟就跑，他醒過來一路喊强盜一路追，鄕人從田裏集攏來將漢子捉到，打了一頓本來是可以釋放的，可是有人說，咱們這裏一向太平，像這樣攔路搶刦謀財害命的事一向沒有過，那還得了！便解到三先生家裏來了。</p>
<p>「解到縣裏去」。三先生說。司是那事主香烟店老板却懇求着，「不要解縣，三先生，我求你老做做好事」。三先生詫異了，睜起了眼珠子，「爲什麽呢，不解縣」？那老板說「你老知道，二十來條香烟不過二十來塊錢，就是搶了去也就罷了，沒有搶成，我沒損失什麽，推車老大受了傷給他醫治亦沒有多少子兒；解縣去，三先生你知道，我得放下店子陪他到縣裏聽審，托老師上狀文，縣裏上下得應酬，二十來塊錢還不够開銷。」</p>
<p>三先生眼皮低下去，在想。「說來亦有道理。可是不解縣，如何辦理」？他在屋子裏走了一個圈兒，衆人的眼光跟着他的脚步在跑，寂靜地沉默着。忽，然三先生的脚步停住了，說道，「不解縣也吧，解區所去」。，那老板還是死僵着，「三先生，你老做做好事，就打他一頓放了吧。解區所去，我亦得陪他走一趟，店裏生意沒人管哩」。三先生不理他，手一揚，鄕民將漢子拉走了。老板嘆了一口氣，知道麻煩是少不了的，又不敢再嚕囌，跟着鄕民退出了三先生的房子。</p>
<p>那漢子卻跪在三先生屋裏地下哭訴著，眼淚鼻涕一齊交流。三先生亦曾被他打動了慈悲心的。無奈案情太過重大，「攔路搶刦，謀財害命」，三先生如何敢釋放他？</p>
<p>可是，第二天，却聽說那漢子在夜裏跑掉了。區所有民團，怎麽會給他跑掉呢？報吿的人說道，「那香烟店老板用錢叫民團放走的啦」。三先生點頭微笑·—責任如今是區所負的了，與他無于。昨天他三先生不敢釋放他走的原因，就是責任的問題，如今好了，他沒責任，大先生回來的話，他好交代。他微笑着說道，「那漢子亦是怪可憐的」。因此想到如果沒有那棍子，他是不會犯法的了。</p>
<p>然而，另外一個問題在三先生的腦里盤旋着：鄉民怕上縣衙門，這可見縣衙門的司法惡習還是沒除掉。</p>

<p>南風吹來了夏的季候，蓮池里開放著半紅半白的荷花，綠葉間雜在紅白的花朶之間，把池子映得更紅艷了。</p>
<p>蟬兒在樹梢里彈起了髙調；抬起頭來，滿樹的綠蔭正把太陽緊密地遮蔽着，間中也從乘隙里偸進了幾綫談談的陽光，在一大塊的陰影下面變成了點點的斑紋。青葱的樹葉的氣息在微風中飄溢，流連在這樹蔭下賞玩着蓮池的景色，格外容易使人感到象懷古的幽患或憑弔往跡那樣輕閑。至少，在這兒總跟那正鬧得繚亂紛紜的現實社會隔開好些世紀了。假如自已是一個翻翻古籍的名士，或是什麽騷人詞客的話，這兒倒是一個大可吟哦或賞美的地方呢。可惜我自己只是一個凡人，在生活的鞭子緊緊的脅迫下，這兒只能作爲我唯一的安息底所在了。</p>
<p>我沒有家。在一條永遠走不完的路上馳奔著，自從在母胎里墜地的那一年起，一直繼續到了現在。—也許正象一隻失巢的小鳥，隨著一大羣的鳥兒們到處飛翔。但我並不知道那兒是我的家。茫然地我在大海里找到一塊破船板，不，我是找到了一個荒蕪的島嶼了；於是我就在這荒島上停留，在這榕樹底下作這一度的流連……</p>
<p>白天，我用半張舊報紙包了兩個粗糙的麺包，邁步向這池子的岸邊來，一走到榕樹蔭下，腳步就驟然止住了，並無須揀擇留在草地上坐了下來，象餓虎樣反麺包塞進嘴裏云。有時也涉足到池子里云摘了一兩朶荷花，把一片片的花瓣剝落在地上，就把那嫩黄的花蕊攤在草地上晒乾了來，帶回家去當做茶葉冲飮了。</p>
<p>夜夜星斗在天空里閃着光灼的眼珠子，我獨自一個人在樹蔭下徜徉着，聽聽晚來靑蛙的叫聲，綠野落在一片無邊的黑暗里，渺小的眼珠子望不見那浩瀚的天涯。偶爾看到一點點的燈光，聽到一些風吹草動的聲調，以及遲緩而沉着的足音，在田野間居然還有以日繼夜的捕靑蛙的人，於是，在自己底荒漠的心田里，也找到一些兒的慰藉了。</p>
<p>我沒有悲哀。永遠地抱着一顆孤獨的心，跟踪着一些年長老邁的一羣，從這兒飄到那兒，如今我飄到這荒島里。可是那一羣呢？已經在風雨險惡之中，象秋后的樹葉那樣，一片一片的隕落了。從茲，只孤單地遺落了我一人。</p>
<p>我在榕樹底下低回著往事，我覺得我不能再孤獨了，當我聽到那遠遠的足音時，我又倔強地從地底下掙扎了起來。看看那榕樹的枝幹，我覺得它還不曾老邁，我自己也尙且年靑，夏風吹不掉靑春的樹葉，我還可以掙扎，持續我的未來，——前面不是還有跟我一樣年靑的一羣麽？……</p>

<p>爲人在世萬事空。海潮不幸命歸終。他日素來身驅甚强壯。那曉得。一病竟然不相逢。我哭一聲黄海潮。服務電台到如今。靜心畢藝一塲空。我哭一聲黄海潮。性情溫和又忠實。待人接物不虛空。我哭一聲黃海潮·你是勿貪財物不愛色·禮義廉恥眞可風·我哭一聲黃海潮·我是天天只望你病體輕。萬不料。病入膏盲入了　　夢。我哭一聲黃海潮。醫生白化無本領。服藥無効不見鬆。哭一聲黄海潮。撇下了堂前老雙親。撇下了四處各聽衆。我哭一聲黃海潮。撇下了房中糟糠妻·身懷六甲淚胸·我是·越思越想越傷心·覺得浮生多事空。生前是。爭天奪地貪財產。死後何曾在手中。富有萬貫家財得。人亡立刻影無蹤。生如百花早逢春。死同黄葉落秋風。可憐你。無兄無弟無姊妹·爹娘如何不心痛。哭一聲·珠淚淋。夢裏如常哭斷魂。好比那。萬把鋼刀將心刺痛。可憐你。心愛諸物拿不去。人亡永世不相逢。人生勞碌一塲空。</p>

<h3 id="c233">制動機使用次數試騐 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 虞</p>
<p>一個駕駛汽車的人，平均在馬路上駕着汽車駛行的當兒，如果要避讓行人，或交通阻隔，不能前進而停車的，究經有多少次數，這是一個很有興味的問題，而且從駕駛術方面講起來，由此可以曉得，車子上的塞車——制動機，在一般人手裏，要使用多少次數，現在這個問題有了解答了，就是從實地試騐上得來，普通一個駕駛汽車的人，在通衢大街間駛行的時候，差不多每一分鐘，要停頓一次的，這就是換一句話來說，每隔不上六十秒鐘的時間中，便要去使用一次塞車哩。</p>
<p>上面所說的塞車使用次數，並不是憑空計算出來，這是完全根據於實地試騐而來的，着手這種試騐的，爲美國密西根的汽車俱樂部，他們因爲要求得適合於「通常」駕駛人的資格起見，所以事先便加物色，以期參予試騐的人，旣不得完全不懂駕駛的生手，也不是超越於普通駕駛人上的老手，因爲這兩種人，一個是不及，一個是太過，前者我們都曉得，因爲駕駛術生疏的缘故，其使用塞車的時侯，一定不能中節，至於後者呢，他們因爲駕駛上熟練的關係，其使用制用機時，也非一般人所能幾及，因之這兩種絕對的人，他們都認爲不合格，而最後乃選定一位女士，名叫伊芙蘭蕙莉慈的，做這種測騐工作，並由潑萊茅斯汽車公司贊襄其事，結果很爲圓滿</p>
<p>蕙莉慈女士所駕的汽車，是一輛新式的潑萊茅斯轎車，自從出發到終止，全部行程所佔的時間計共八小時，在八小時中間，蕙女士使用塞車數計共五百四十七次，爲求試騐上的正確和得獲記錄起見，在車上的塞車蹬旁裝置一個連接着的「停頓計算表」，因之凡用塞車一次，而駕車者有一次動作時，這個計算表便老老實實的記了起來。</p>
<p>試騐地點便是美國赫赫有名的汽車製造中心區底德羅，由密西根汽車俱樂部職員監視，並爲昭以大公起見，在出發和終止的時侯，請了兩個公證人檢視一切，出發時主持一切的爲當地警署交通委員約翰弗萊氏，終點負檢靦停頓計算表記錄責任的，爲警務公安局主任威士雷勃朗上尉，蕙莉慈所走的道路，各各不同，區域也儘不相同，因爲在一個城市裏，有些地方熱鬧，有些地方冷靜，熱鬧的地方，人烟稠密，車輛來往自然十分頻繁，冷靜的地方，居戶較稀久交通情形另有一番樣子，而且在一天中間，時候上有也許多不同的地方，像在早晨上午，郊外的人都忙着上市區和商業中心去，在城區裏車馬暄關，擠得水洩不通，反之在下午六七時光景城區裏的人又紛紛返郊外去，於是在接通鄉郊的馬路上，便車水馬龍，無異長蛇封豕，像一條沒有頭尾的帶子，蕙莉慈女士的車子儘在這許多地方駛行着，她用塞車的時候，並不隨隨便便，一定要看當時的環境，非用塞車不可以的，她方纔使用着，所以在她駕駛的全部行程中，她使用制動機並不濫而漫無限制的。</p>
<p>蕙莉慈女士使用塞車的次數，隨了時間和馬路上交通狀况而各有多少不同，在她開始駕車出發的一小時文半的時間中，她總共使用制動機一百次，就是在途中車子停了一百次，在上午十一時到正午的一點鐘中間，她停了三十四次，在正午到下午一點鐘的一小時間，却停了八十八次，這種情形，大概在都市裏都差不多的，因爲從正午到下午一時，正時大家進膳的時候，馬路上車輛來往，載客獨多，尤其在公司機關集中的區域中，一敲十二點鐘，辦事的職員們，爭先恐後的跑上街道中去，於是馬路上平添了不少的行人，汽車在馬路　　行的當兒，如果碰着行人在路穿走來往，當然要煞車避讓，因之使用制動機的次數，就增多了。</p>
<p>這次試騐的時間，一共是八小時，蕙莉慈女士在這大半天中間，她所走的路程一長有一十四百三十三英里，平均每小時的速度爲十八英里稍爲過一些，可說速度很是酌中，並不十分高，這大半由於她所經過的地方，不容開駛過快，車輛和行人，當然也是絡釋不絕於途中的，蕙莉慈女士在全程的駕駛中，最快速度不過每小時三十英里，大半時間，速度記新紀錄的爲每小時二十五英里</p>
<p>事後據哈夫司脫氏說，從這個試騐上，可知在市區駕駛汽車，那塞車的必須良佳勝任，是毫不容忽視的，蕙莉慈女士在這次試騐中，差不多每分鐘要用一次多的制動機，也就是每行一英里要用三次，所以最後哈氏說，他對於這些數目字深爲興奮，其他的駕駛人對之也常深切了解，制動機在汽車駕駛上是怎樣的具有重要性了。</p>
<h3 id="c234">使用車胎應有的注意 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— 陳星</p>
<p>車胎的氣壓。無論何時。都須使其在規定的限度之內。普通規定的胎氣壓力。係最低限度。决不可再稍使低降。而應令略微超過。故若車胎的規定氣雕爲三十二磅。則打氣時宜打足三十四磅。於是每週施以檢査。如發覺稍减。卽須補足。良好的車胎。每週所洩去的氣量。不會超過兩磅。如達此數。則對於該胎。特別是打氣門。就有加以嚴重注意的必要。舊的裏胎。當然較新的更易洩氣。如果你所用的裏胎過舊。而其洩氣於是極速。那末。與其仍舊裝用該舊裏胎。致外胎因氣量不足而遭意外的磨蝕。不如另換一只新裏胎。經濟多多。氣量過足。則胎面中心受意外的磨蝕。氣量不够。則車胎兩旁。會遭不正當的損害。</p>
<p>不論在什麼時候。當你將車胎拆下而又裝上。或裝上新胎。在不能確定其氣壓是否適度之先。切莫就出發作長途的駕駛。理由是當車胎裝上鋼圈。開始行駛。遭受極强的壓這。就會洩去氣體若干磅，而使你的車胎因氣壓不足而受傷。所以最好的辦法。當胎裝上打足氣後。駛了四五英里時。卽將車子停下。施以檢査。如發覺不足。須卽予補充。新胎在開始裝用的最初幾星期內。漏氣較速。亦應加以注意。</p>
<p>切莫將車胎永在同一的車輪上裝用。把你的車胎。不斷地從這一車輪。換至另一車輪。則車胎所受的磨蝕。可以大减。你的備胎。亦須包括在調換的序程中。不可留着不用。超過六個月以上。因時間過久。則其損蝕極速。故使用車胎更經濟的方法。是在將車胎調換裝用於汽車的各車輪。經過許多汽車的寳騐。一般工程師定出了一個循環調換法。以便利施行。每當車行五千英里（八千公里）。可依鐘向。將車胎調換。卽把右前胎。換至右後輪。右後胎換至備胎輸。備胎換至左後輸。這樣再繼續調換過去。備胎如果有兩只。則均須加入調換。另一有價値的工作。往往容易忽略。你亦須加以注意。倘若車輸的鋼圈。一邊永遠是向車子的外方。則車胎在同一車輪上。應不時加以調換。向外方的一邊。可換向裏方。一只車胎。常在同一車輪上裝用。必致發生不平均的磨蝕。例如前胎與後胎。其磨蝕的程度。必不相同。左邊的車胎。因易接近路邊。損蝕更易。而胎壁則有被街沿擦傷的可能。</p>
<p>一般以爲後胎爆裂。所有危險。可較前胎爆裂爲輕。因而將後輪裝用舊胎。對於此種觀念。切不可加以信賴。這是不對的。許多次的試騐。都證明因爆裂而生之危險。後胎不稍减於前胎。當路面發現滑溜時。適逢後胎爆裂。於是胎卽癟掉。胎面的防滑稜紋。失了作用。汽車後端。爲接受動力。推動車輛前進的部份。因而會增加車輛滑溜程度。至極可驚。此時所生之危險。委實較前胎的爆裂更大。有了這個理由。對於雖較完好。但無稜紋的車胎。有時亦須盡可能避免裝用於後輪。</p>
<p>除非駕駛救火車。救護車與警務車。切勿在髙速時轉彎。因其損蝕車胎。較其他一切情形爲劇。當你在高速時。扳轉轉向盤。車胎自然也跟着轉過。但車胎因惰性作用。依原來方向。向前衝滾之勢殊猛。這樣。胎壁遭受一種可怖的壓逼。而整個車胎。會向路之一邊。滑過一英寸或更多。如果你欲知道由此所致的車胎損傷稈度如何。你可取一新胎。做好記號。以全力壓之。使其向前向後。滾過六英寸寬的新混凝土路。約五百次。然後加以察視。其損蝕的程度。往往較裝於車上的新胎。於時速五十英里時轉彎。所受的損蝕爲輕。</p>
<p>除掉欲避免肇禍。切勿猛烈使用剎車。猛烈的使用刹車。會損及刹車帶　煞車鼓。及車輛其他各部。這且不要提起。而對於車胎。則能發生極壞的結果。當你把車輪煞定時。惰性仍强迫汽車向前進行。故煞車動作。如果十分急驟。則汽車會向前衝滑。可能把你的四隻車胎。擦去一大塊橡皮。此外。猛烈使用煞車。會使車胎底邊受劇震。致橡皮編織層　。及二者的結合處受損傷。故使用煞車。須十分緩和。方不致使車胎受意外的損害。煞車所予四輪的制力。應平均一致。否則，某一些車胎。會受上述同樣的損蝕。所以一種優良的煞車校準器械。必須時携帶着。俾可用以校準煞車。使其平均一致。</p>
<p>你的車輸。須經常加以檢査和校準。前後車輪。須同樣爲之。欲其校準準確。可由專門人材執行。前輪有無失常。須由一定的器械加以檢査。任何臆測。均不會準確。倘你的汽車已舊。經檢査結果。知道某些機件。已經磨損。致車輛發生搖擺。卽須加以修理。甚至調換新抽承。轉向梢與塾套。搖擺的車輪。會躍離地面。此對車胎。有極大的損害。如果你對於車輪。不能作正確的校準。而對於車輪的搖擺。無法加以糾正。則擺在你眼前的。不僅大增車胎修理費。而且還要頻調新車胎。此外。搖擺的車胎。使車胎與路面。起不規則的磨擦。因而車胎任憑如何堅固。沒有不遭意外的磨蝕的。</p>
<p>不時審視你的車胎。有無刺入甚麽東西。胎面的防滑稜紋。若嵌入石屑。必須把牠取去。如讓其留着。則將刺入胎面及編織層。使編織層受損破碎。這會使車胎發生爆裂及硫化。最安妥的辦法。須不時以旋錯將刺入車胎的石屑取去。若有小釘及其他尖銳物。其應逐一淸除。</p>
<p>速率過高。車胎會生髙熱。車胎因氣候過熱。其磨蝕卽超出平常的程度。氣候凉爽及道路潮濕時。車胎的熱度。能够散去。磨蝕可以减輕故冬天與兩季。車胎磨蝕的程度。當較夏季爲輕。在極熱的天氣。駛車於乾燥的路上。再加以極高的速率。車胎於是產生髙熱。同時並增加其磨蝕的速度。若車胎已受有許多損傷。則在此種情形之下。可致車胎於爆裂。及其他類似的嚴重事件。</p>
<p>起動過驟。使車胎遭受與急停同樣的損害。不過其方向相反罷了。起動過驟。車輪卽起滑滾。車胎因而受極大的損害。故在某種情形之下。起動可用二檔。免使車輪滑滾。而致車胎受傷。</p>
<p>行車勿使車胎撞於或馳經街沿。用如此濫用。車胎必須致受傷。你的裏胎。會被鋼圈鉗住。編織層會因鬆弛而破裂。若干日。或一個月後。你的車胎。將因而發生爆裂。這時你若仍舊不能覓出爆裂的眞是原因。你將對他人作無理的責備。</p>
<p>當你駕駛時。忽覺轉向有異。卽須將車慢慢停下。將每一車胎。依法施以嚴密的檢査。這往往爲車胎將要爆裂所致成。這樣。你不僅可以找出車胎的弊病。而加以修換。避免了危險。而且。車胎不致爆裂。你不可以省郤許多修理費呢。</p>

<p>統一汽車捐照時期　美國汽車會主席湯麥士亨萊。鑒於在各州駛行的汽車。因爲捐照過期失效而被拘的。常年總有幾千起。而這種所謂失效的捐照。在他各本州裏是仍舊生效的一。因之建議全國各州的汽車捐照時期。應該劃一。免去駕駛者的許多麻煩。和管理上的一切糾紛。據亨萊氏說。目下各州的汽車捐照時期。非常的不一致。現在的糾紛已經很不少。將來的混亂當更在意中。如果國中能規定一律的捐照時期。那末獲益一定很多哩。在美國的四十州中和哥侖比亞區內。汽車註冊捐照的時期自一月一日開始。而終止和寬放的日子各不一律。阿拉向麥從十月一日開始捐照。南卡洛立那十一月一日。南達各太四月一日。浮蒙四月一日。佛傑尼亞四月一日。烏太三月一日。西佛傑尼亞七月一日。各各不同。亨萊氏又說。在目下有五州提議更動。哇海華·本雪文尼亞·和惠司康辛·從一月一日起到七月一日。米內沙太到四月十四日。德蕯司到七月一日。亨萊最後希望美國汽車會能够救濟數千被拘的汽車駕駛者。</p>

<p>Central Commemoration of Confucius' Birthday</p>
<p>(Nanjing) This morning, the Central Government and the National Government jointly held a commemoration of Confucius' birthday in the Central Auditorium. Attendees included Central Committee members Ju Zheng, Ye Chucang, Chen Shuren, Shi Ying, He Yingqin, Huang Musong, Dai Chuanxian, Zhu Jiahua, Chu Minyi, Ma Chaojun, Ding Weifen, Hong Ludong, Fang Juehui, Li Zonghuang, as well as heads of various agencies Chen Diaoyuan, Chen Shaokuan, Yang Jie, etc., colleagues from central organizations, and representatives from various agencies, totaling approximately several hundred people. After Ju Zheng, the chairman, led the ceremony, Ye Chucang gave a report, stating that the Three Principles of the People of the Premier are largely the same as Confucius' teachings. He continued that past sacrifices to Confucius emphasized only the ritualistic aspects, and that in the future, ritual should correspond to inner feeling, so that it originates from the heart. However, ritual alone is not enough; one must seek to admire, then from admiration to ritual, and from ritual to ceremony. Commemorations of this kind will be solemn and meaningful. Now, regarding Confucius, it is not only a matter of believing in his teachings, but also of studying the content of his teachings. Recently, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek stated that the "Great Learning" is the foundation of Chinese political philosophy, which is a more explicit pronouncement. Finally, Ye encouraged everyone, beyond belief, to strive to study the content. (Central News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>

There were over a thousand disaster victims in the two locations. Han comforted the disaster victims, saying that although they had suffered from natural disasters, the government would do its best to find solutions to the problems of food, clothing, and shelter, and hoped that everyone would be content and maintain their integrity. He also instructed County Magistrate Zhang to ensure that the disaster victims learn to read and write and do work, and that women unbind their feet.

Kong Decheng is scheduled to hold another grand sacrificial ceremony on the 29th. Chairman Han told the Central News Agency reporter that the central government sent him as a representative to offer the sacrifice with utmost sincerity. The repairs to the sacred temple require too much money, which is not currently available, and will have to wait until next spring. The disaster situation in western Shandong is dire, and blocking the breach is difficult. Relief for the disaster victims is especially important, and we are doing our best to provide shelter so that they do not leave the area and become displaced. (Central News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>

However, since the close of the meeting, there had been no news of preparations, and recently some people had advocated strange theories, saying that closing the breach was hopeless and that guidance should be studied, as well as the opening of the Lanjia Dam mouth. However, the Lanjia Dam mouth had long since collapsed, and the Old River and the Grand Canal had also overflowed one after another, with the disaster area gradually expanding, and there was no benefit to the upstream. This is sufficient proof that free flow into the sea is impossible, and how can the guiding works be easily carried out? If it is allowed to erode naturally, it will become lakes and swamps without waiting to enter the sea. Even assuming that it can naturally change course, building large dikes on both banks according to the trend would cost hundreds of times more than closing the breach. Moreover, the people affected by the disaster are displaced and have nowhere to return, and their fields, homes, and graves will be permanently submerged, while the original riverbed below the breach will become wasteland. What could be more unfeeling and unreasonable than this? The only thing to do is to implore the central government to quickly allocate funds for construction to be completed before the peach flood, saving the starving and rescuing the drowning. This is the only chance, and so on. (Special Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3 id="e11">Kong Xiangrong Telegraphed That the Yellow River Water Level Was Rising <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Kong Xiangrong, the Executive Yuan's inspector of flood prevention in the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan, telegraphed from Beijing on the morning of the 27th that the water level station in Shaanxi County reported that at 8 AM on the 25th of this month, the water level was 293.837 meters and the flow rate was 5100 cubic meters per second. At 2 AM on the 26th, the water level at the same location reached 294.52 meters and the flow rate increased to 8200 cubic meters per second. This rise in river water, although not as severe as the flood on the 8th of this month, is 0.88 meters higher than the ice level on the 9th of this month, and the flow rate has increased by 3000 cubic meters per second. In a blink of an eye, it will reach the flood areas under the jurisdiction of Henan, Hebei, and Shandong, and strict precautions should be taken as soon as possible to avoid negligence. In addition to sending separate telegrams to the governments of the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan, and forwarding them to the river affairs bureaus of each province, and directly telegraphing them to strictly prevent them, I also sent personnel to inspect and supervise the prevention along the river.

Han will allocate 10,000 refugees to move to Qufu, and has obtained the consent of Kong Decheng to allocate a part of the Confucius Temple and the Yan Temple as refugee shelters. Han said that all of the more than 2 million refugees in western Shandong will be resettled in this province to prevent them from leaving the country. (Central News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>(Xuzhou) The Jing River downstream has risen by one centimeter today, and the water flow at Jing Mountain Bridge is very large. Wang Gongqiong went to inspect. The Tianjin-Pukou Railway transported 700 English cubic feet of stone, and the Longhai Railway transported 1,000 French cubic feet of stone to help build transverse dikes along the Tianjin-Pukou line to prevent the Jing River from overflowing. After the new dike at Pipa Mountain was built, it was reinforced by the 2nd Engineer Regiment by adding piles and stacking them to ensure its firmness to block the raging currents.

<p>(Xuzhou) Wu Yiming, the chief of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Works Bureau, returned to Xuzhou from Jinan this morning after inspecting the water situation in various sections to the north. According to him, the water flow at Maocun is greater than at Hanzhuang. The current water volume can still be discharged by the bridges on this line. The stone masonry on the roadbed is to prevent the waves from impacting it. Fortunately, the water flow is rising slowly in each section. If the water flow is too fast, it is feared that traffic will be affected. Wu returned to Pu by train in the evening. (Special Dispatch, 27th).</p>

A formal joint trial will be conducted soon by the Luan Yu District Commissioner's Office of the Hebei Provincial Government and other agencies. After the trial, the Hebei Provincial Security Command may handle the case. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The assassin of Liu, Li Zhenhua, was escorted to Tangshan on the 26th, where Yin Rugeng personally interrogated him. Li's confession differed slightly from his previous statements. Li claimed to be from Heishan County and had served as a company, battalion, and regimental commander in the Northeast National Salvation Army. After the September 18th Incident, he entered the customs and participated in the volunteer army. He later changed his name to Zhang Zhihe. After the volunteer army was disbanded, he joined a certain division in Junliangcheng. When the army was transferred south, he remained in Tanggu due to illness. He resided in the same residence with members of the Northeast People's Communist Army, organized by Shi Yousan, Zhang Bi, and others, introduced by Li Jieshi, and served as the commander of the seventh district, operating in the Luyu area. A secret meeting was held last month in Mount Wutai in Shanxi, where it was decided to form a North China State and launch an uprising in the winter. Because Liu Zuozhou hindered their progress, it was decided to eliminate him. After three months of reconnaissance near Luan County, they finally made their move. There were five accomplices: two ambushed at the platform, two ambushed by the roadside, and one ambushed at the city gate. After the attack, two escaped to Beiping, two escaped to Qinhuangdao, and the remaining one hid in the house of a village chief named Chang in Xiangge Village, where he was captured. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Liu Yushu, the director of the Public Security Bureau of Tianjin, stated that the detectives dispatched by the bureau to Luan County to assist in the arrest of the assassin have returned to Tianjin.

<h3 id="e44">The Rent Reduction Movement and the Housing Problem <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>The demand for rent reduction has a long history. Initially, tenants and landlords formed their own alliances, creating a confrontational situation. After the January 28th Incident, the Shanghai market experienced significant changes. The demand for rent reduction became even more urgent. By last year, panic was palpable, and various industries were in a slump. Maintaining livelihoods became increasingly difficult. Yet, rents remained unchanged from the past, placing an invisible burden on people. In recent years, some property owners have voluntarily reduced rents, but the recent "Rent Reduction Movement Week" suggests that there is still a sense of helplessness. Let us examine the general living conditions to discuss ways to solve the housing problem.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the housing problem in Shanghai is unreasonable. The so-called "pigeon coop" style housing is generally recognized. The poor living in shantytowns live in unsanitary, damp, and filthy conditions. Shanghai's housing situation ranges from ancient cave dwellings to new 20th-century architecture. Few can enjoy a "grassland" lifestyle. Even those living in single-family homes are a minority. An examination of the household registration survey by the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau reveals this. According to the Shanghai household registration survey in July of this year (excluding the Special District), there are 187,053 primary households and 226,723 secondary households. Numerically, there are 39,670 more secondary households than primary households. In terms of ratio, secondary households make up 121.2% of primary households. Breaking it down by district is even more revealing. The following table uses the number of primary households in each police precinct as a percentage and shows the ratio of secondary households to demonstrate the proportion of primary to secondary households.</p>

<p>Yangsi 66.4% Gaoqiao 19.6% Donggou 29.3%</p>
<p>From the above table, it can be seen that the more prosperous the city, the greater the proportion of secondary households. Wusong, Jiangwan, and Pudong are not as prosperous as Western Shanghai. However, within Pudong, the ratio of secondary households in Pudong is 113.4%, while in Gaoqiao, it is only 19.6%. Although Western Shanghai is prosperous, it is not as much as Southern and Northern Shanghai. This is because part of Western Shanghai is a residential area for wealthy Chinese and foreign merchants, so there are fewer secondary households. Southern and Northern Shanghai rely on their original markets, which have increased over the years. The population is flourishing, making them the leaders of the Chinese areas. Therefore, the proportion of secondary households has also gradually increased. In the areas managed by the Yongxing Road and Linping Road police stations in Northern Shanghai and the Old North Gate police station in Southern Shanghai, there are more than two secondary households per primary household. On average, there is more than one. The density of the population in the Special District is even higher than in the Chinese areas. Except for a few residential areas for the middle class and above, the trend of subletting is rampant due to high rents. Therefore, if there were accurate figures for secondary households, the percentage would certainly be greater than in the Chinese areas. To be crammed into a small room, to eat, cook, live, sleep, to hear the crying and laughter of children, to receive guests, to work hard all day long, and yet to have such limited space for recovery and rest is a truly pitiful life for urban residents.</p>
<p>If this is due to a lack of housing, then the supply should be increased, and housing prices should be leveled so that the general public can enjoy a more reasonable "decent" life. If the "pigeon coop" lifestyle is due to high rents, then rent should be reduced to alleviate their hardship. There is no such thing as a rent reduction. When everything else is cheap, but rent alone is expensive, it is not fair. It should be reduced in line with general prices. The causes of high rents are: (1) the land and housing prices were pushed up by the speculative tide of the Republic of China's tenth year; (2) the high cost of imported building materials was used as an excuse due to the high value of gold and the low value of silver in previous years; (3) real estate transactions became extremely speculative; (4) landlords deliberately focused on the novelty of architectural styles to extract high rents. As a result, only the middle class and above can cope, while everyone below is oppressed by "high rents." Since rents could be increased in the past due to certain circumstances, why can't they be reduced now due to certain circumstances? Even for the landlords, if they want to revive the real estate industry, it cannot be solved by issuing circulation vouchers or establishing exchanges. Real estate must have new value before transactions can be revived. This new value must start with revising rents. Because rent revision can make those with financial resources believe that they can maintain the lowest return on their investment, and then transactions can be expected to be smooth. Therefore, a fair rent reduction is not only a blessing for tenants but also a benefit for landlords. Landlords should endure the pain for a while and make this long-term plan.</p>

<p>(Washington) The House of Representatives adjourned sine die at midnight, and the Senate also declared its closure five minutes later. The Third Supplemental Appropriation Bill and the amendment to the Agricultural Adjustment Act regarding cotton and wheat loans failed to pass. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Congress declared its adjournment today. Senator Huey Long made a seven-hour-long rant in an attempt to obstruct the vote. Long, who was originally a lonely and helpless figure in the Senate, used his persuasive tongue to kill the Third Financial Deficiency Relief Bill, which contained a total of $97 million for old-age pensions, retired road workers' subsidies, and the care of disabled children. Long was like a dominant demon king today. Any plea or threat to him was not enough to move him. The House of Representatives, feeling bored after adjourning, invited the US Navy Band to play music for entertainment. Later, many members of Congress flocked to the Senate to listen. The Senate then also adjourned, and Speaker Byrns read President Roosevelt's message of thanks to the legislators. Late at night, the 74th First Congress became a historical record. (National Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt advocated that Congress adjourn after passing the Financial Deficiency Bill, but Senator Huey Long stood up and spoke at the last minute, disrupting the President's plan. Long claimed that he was fighting for a principle, that is, the Senate's amendment to the cotton and wheat loan was not given a chance to be voted on in the House of Representatives. The President had previously agreed to a compromise on the cotton loan, and the two houses passed a resolution to adjourn at midnight. Although the House of Representatives sent the Financial Deficiency Bill back to the Senate, the leaders of the government in the Senate asked the entire house to unanimously agree to withdraw the amendment. Long alone dissented. Majority Leader Robinson and Black denounced Long for deliberately destroying the bill that provided for disability pensions. But Long remained unyielding and shouted that he would never submit. As a result, the Deficiency Bill died due to lack of time, and the cotton and wheat amendment was also shelved. It is expected that the funds needed for social security and other programs will be allocated from the works progress funding. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The 74th First Congress, which adjourned today, passed a relief bill of $900 million. If distributed equally, each American would bear $68. This is a huge sum unseen since the Great War. The most notable feature of this Congress is that none of the goals sought by the government and the New Deal faction were achieved. All legislative bills were to remedy the various bills overturned by the Supreme Court's ruling. (National Society Telegram, 26th)</p>

<p>(Washington) The Agricultural Adjustment Administration announced tonight a change in cotton policy, increasing the government loan from nine cents to ten cents per pound. This is the result after both houses of Congress shelved the Senate's loan proposal of twelve and a half cents. (National Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Senate Majority Leader Robinson stated today that the Agricultural Adjustment Administration's cotton loan plan has been revised, with the loan amount set at ten cents per pound, with a guarantee of twelve and a half cents for cotton farmers. This new plan requires daily calculations and payments to cotton farmers to make up the twelve and a half cents, as payments will be based on the daily average price, not the four-month average price. If so, the price obtained by cotton farmers will not be far from twelve and a half cents per pound. (Reuters, 26th)</p>

<p>(Washington) The major bills passed during the first session of the 74th Congress include the following:</p>
<p>(1) Social Security Act: This law stipulates that the federal government immediately provide assistance to states to subsidize elderly paupers, while establishing a permanent national pension system. In addition, it requests that the federal government and state governments jointly establish an unemployment insurance system.</p>
<p>(2) Wagner-Connery Labor Disputes Act: This law stipulates that the federal government, within its legal jurisdiction, protect workers' rights to organize unions and engage in collective bargaining with employers.</p>
<p>(3) Banking Act: This law fundamentally reforms the existing Federal Reserve System, thereby strengthening the government's control over national lending institutions. This law imposes centralized control over the flow of credit and money, and the rediscounting of bills, while opening up various methods to facilitate credit expansion. One of the most notable points of this law is that it continues to maintain the insurance system for bank deposits.</p>
<p>(4) Relief Act: Authorizes the President to use $8,000,000,000 USD as unemployment relief funds, and $4,000,000,000 USD for work relief projects.</p>
<p>(5) Wealth Tax Act: This law increases income tax rates for annual incomes above $50,000 USD, and also significantly increases taxes on real estate and business taxes. As a result of the increased taxes under this bill, the national treasury can increase revenue by $250,000,000 USD annually.</p>
<p>(6) Agricultural Adjustment Act Amendment: Intended to consolidate the legality of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration.</p>
<p>(7) Tennessee Valley Authority Amendment: Authorizes the TVA to sell electricity to users.</p>
<p>(8) Air Mail Act: Stipulates the funding for opening up the Pacific air route, and also instructs the Interstate Commerce Commission to investigate whether the fees charged by the U.S. air mail service are appropriate.</p>
<p>(9) Transportation Act: This law places all interstate buses, trams, and trains under the management of the Interstate Commerce Commission.</p>
<p>(10) Recovery Act: This law stipulates that the Recovery Act be extended to April 1, 1936.</p>
<p>(11) Spanish-American War Veterans Act: This law fully restores the allowance payments of veterans from the 1898 war.</p>
<p>(12) Public Utilities Act: Although this law differs from the original proposal, it has revoked the franchises of most businesses.</p>
<p>(13) National Defense Act: Stipulates that $100,000,000 be used for the army and navy. The U.S. Army, which originally consisted of 163,000 men, will increase by 50,000 men under this law. In addition, several hundred aircraft and twenty-four warships will be built, and several new air force bases will be established.</p>
<p>(14) Extension of Agricultural Mortgage Act: This bill gives farmers some breathing room. Finally, Congress took no action on currency inflation during this session. (National News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt signed the Wheeler-Rayburn Public Utility Act at 3:10 PM today. The bill has been the subject of a lengthy dispute. The Senate insisted that the provisions for cracking down on holding companies must be retained, while the House advocated for their deletion. Subsequently, a joint conference committee of the two houses agreed on a compromise solution, retaining the general principles of the Senate's original bill, which then enabled the House to accept it. Observers say that the House's acceptance was also due to the circumstances, because the President supported the compromise, and the most stringent points of the original bill had been softened, and with the congressional adjournment approaching, there was a desire to conclude the bills. As for the content of the compromise agreement, informed sources claim that the government has largely achieved the privileges it requested, but with slight modifications, so that the House leadership could offer some justification. The most important of the modifications is that the Securities and Exchange Commission has the power to decide which second-tier holding companies should be dismantled after 1938, whereas the original Senate bill stipulated that all holding companies above the first tier must be dismantled after 1942.

<p>(Moscow) The British protest against the activities of Moscow Communist propagandists in Britain has been rejected by the Soviet Russian authorities. The Soviet Russian authorities seem to regard their Communist Party as unrelated to the Soviet Russian government and therefore refuse to consider this protest.

(Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) The British Ambassador to Russia, following instructions from the British government, today drew the attention of the Russian authorities to the propaganda activities of the Moscow Communist Party in Britain.

Britain did not exchange views with the United States or any other country beforehand. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Today's U.S. protest to Russia is regarded by official and press circles here as the most strongly worded since the U.S. severed relations with Russia in 1917. It has been repeatedly stated here that the U.S. recognition of Soviet Russia at the end of 1933 was based on the following four hopes: (1) Russia would purchase U.S. heavy industry products; (2) Debts owed to the U.S. would be cleared; (3) Powerful friendly ties could be established regarding Far Eastern affairs; (4) Soviet Russia would formally supervise and control communist activities in the U.S. However, in reality, large orders have not been fulfilled, and there is still no solution to the debts owed to the U.S., and the speeches and resolutions at the recent Third International Congress have become the final straw in U.S.-Russian relations. At the same time, Soviet Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Troyanovsky said that Moscow will have a satisfactory response, and his personal opinion is that the speeches made by the American people in Moscow are but a drop in the bucket compared to the anti-Russian propaganda in the United States. According to Moscow news, Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov is currently not in the capital, and local newspapers have not mentioned a word about the U.S. protest.

<p>(Moscow dispatch, TASS, August 6) The Moscow reconstruction plan has opened up great prospects for Soviet architects' creative work. In the next ten years, various large-scale constructions will completely transform Moscow. The largest of these buildings is the Palace of Soviets, topped with a Lenin statue, 80 meters high. The height of the palace, including the Lenin statue, will reach 415 meters. Currently, the palace's designers, researchers from the Soviet Academy of Sciences, architects Iofan and Gelfreich, and Lantsere, are drafting its final plan. The cornerstone will be laid next year. The central part of the palace will have foundations reaching 30 meters deep, with a very thick layer of limestone underneath.</p>
<p>The Soviet Academy of Sciences is located in the center of the new Moscow district, facing the Lenin Hills. This science city has a total of 40 buildings, covering an area of 10 to 100 hectares, with a volume of 2.5 million cubic meters. The Botanical Garden nearby covers an area of 4500 hectares.</p>
<p>The Literary Research Institute, suggested by Gorky, is currently being designed by researcher Rylkovsky, with a volume of more than 500,000 cubic meters. A monument to Pushkin and his era will be erected in front of it.</p>
<p>The Central Sports Arena is currently being built in Izmailovo, a suburb of Moscow, covering an area of 300 hectares. The central grandstand of the arena can accommodate 400,000 spectators. The plan also includes establishing a sports research institute to accommodate 1,000 students. The arena also includes a team ball field, a tennis field, a shooting range, a safety parachute jumping platform, a racing track, etc. Each sports field's grandstand can accommodate 10,000 people.</p>
<p>The Soviet Experimental Medical College will be built on the banks of the Moscow River. The college has 10,000 rooms, of which 8,500 are various laboratories. To the left is a diagnostic room, and there is also a four-story building specifically for raising animals used in the experimental rooms. A huge "Book Hall" will be built on the corner of the Orekhovo-Zuevo Proyezd. Various publishing houses and book display areas will be moved to the hall, and a bookstore will also be established. The hall is designed by architect Golosov.</p>
<p>Currently, famous Moscow architects are studying street layout, embankment construction, and other building plans. These plans are all stipulated by the Moscow Ten-Year Reconstruction Plan.</p>

<p>(Rome) The Italian newspaper Il Giornale d'Italia carried an article today commenting on a telegram from Tokyo stating that Japan is gradually able to understand Italy's position on Abyssinia, and seized the opportunity to vigorously promote Italian-Japanese friendship. The article stated that the two countries are now pursuing development in the same direction, so there is no possibility of discord. Both countries need new land as the final destination for their increasing populations, and both are seeking natural resources that have been denied to them. After the European War, both countries felt that they were being treated with a closed door. The two countries are now encountering resistance from the League of Nations and are not allowed to enjoy the right to expand their growing populations. The problems facing Italy and Japan are of the same nature, so the two countries must seek political unity to resist their opponents. Italy's use of force in Abyssinia does not harm Japan's interests in any way, because what Italy seeks is the safety of Italians in Abyssinia and to provide Abyssinian land for the operation and trade of civilized countries, not to close the door and monopolize its benefits, and even less to close the door due to racial differences. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's remarks to the Daily Mail yesterday made a deep impression on people in political circles here. It is believed that the British government's views on the issue of sanctions will be affected by this. Some British cabinet members believe that the proposal for sanctions is likely to expand the scope of the conflict. They originally expressed opposition, and now with Mussolini's remarks, this view is becoming stronger. The British government's proposal to strictly implement the League of Nations Covenant will inevitably be shaken slightly, but the British delegation's actions must be extremely cautious, and when the points of Italy's accusations against Abyssinia are submitted for discussion in the League of Nations Council, they must also use delaying tactics to avoid mentioning the word "sanctions." If all kinds of mediation methods ultimately fail, then the British government's final action will depend on the extent to which domestic public opinion supports or opposes the League of Nations policy. At this time, all factions in Britain are using the Abyssinian issue as discussion and propaganda material. All those who support the League of Nations and extremist left-wing groups say that the League of Nations is a symbol of democracy against dictatorship, and the British people must assist the League of Nations. Those who advocate isolation repeatedly declare, "Britain must not be dragged into the whirlpool of war." Members of the Pan-System Party are distributing leaflets advising the public to only consider British interests. In cinemas in London, especially in cinemas in suburban working-class areas, when newsreels involving the Italian-Abyssinian dispute are shown, the audience expresses disgust towards the Italian dictatorship, especially towards Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. If other newsreels involve anti-war messages, they are greeted with enthusiastic applause. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>

(National News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The government is currently drafting a memorandum on Italy's reasons in the Abyssinian case, which will be submitted to the League of Nations Council meeting on September 4. It is heard that Italy advocates that Abyssinia should be expelled from the League of Nations. At the same time, political circles are keeping silent about the extraordinary cabinet meeting to be convened in Bolzano today. It is said that the meeting will only discuss administrative issues, and will not mention Abyssinia or other important issues. Mussolini is currently leading a large army in large-scale exercises in northern Italy, and has suddenly convened a cabinet meeting, probably to announce his intentions towards Abyssinia. Mr. Mussolini met yesterday with General Pes trolo, Vice-Minister of the Army, and listened to his report on the progress of the exercises. It is said that morale is excellent and the work of each team is very efficient, especially the mobile guerrilla division. The King of Italy arrived at the "front line" before dawn, got out of the car several times, inquired of officers, and had long talks with the commanders of the opposing armies.

<p>(London) Minister Without Portfolio Eden and Foreign Secretary Hoare, after attending the cabinet meeting on the 22nd and 23rd, left London one after another, and are scheduled to return here this afternoon. According to news from Italy, the Italian government is currently collecting various documents, preparing to submit them to the League of Nations to accuse Abyssinia. Although officials refuse to comment on this matter, a good impression has already been formed in Britain. The general public believes that the Italian government intends to tell the world the details of what happened when the Italian-Abyssinian dispute occurred, which is consistent with what Britain advocates. It is heard that Minister Without Portfolio Eden is also preparing documents on the Italian-Abyssinian dispute and is working with the French government. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3 id="e62">Three Italian Navy Generals Petition the Government, Volunteering for Service; Mussolini Arrives in the North to Observe Military Exercises <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>(Rome) Three famous naval generals recently submitted a petition to the government, requesting to be assigned any task that would allow them to serve in Italian East Africa. One is Count Ciano, the former Minister of Transportation and current Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, and son-in-law of Prime Minister Mussolini. He served as a fleet commander during the European War, stormed the port of Pola, sank an Austrian warship, and blockaded the port. The second is Vice Admiral Rizzo, and the third is Admiral Pagano, who once led a fleet into the Turkish Dardanelles Strait. In addition, the King's cousin, the Duke of Guergama, will soon go to East Africa to serve in the Italian Army's General Staff. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(Rome) It is reported that the memorandum that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini intends to send to the League of Nations is very long, listing the hostile actions of the Abyssinians over the years, with photographs as evidence. According to Italian newspapers, Admiral Ciano, one of Italy's naval heroes in the European War, telegraphed Mussolini, requesting to be assigned to the most threatened area of Italian waters. It is said that this is in response to Britain's deployment of warships, especially in Maltese waters, which Italian newspapers are highlighting. At the same time, the army is conducting exercises in the rain in Bolzano, northern Italy. During a mock air raid last night, Mussolini was "hit by a bomb." (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>Bolzano Today in the afternoon, Prime Minister Mussolini suddenly arrived here to observe the military exercises. This is his first visit to the province of South Tyrol in twelve years of governing. After arriving, Mussolini immediately drove to the town hall to rest. As he passed through the streets, he stood up in the car, and women along the way threw flowers and kissed their hands, while men cheered and shouted, "Leader, we are willing to fight, please send us to East Africa quickly, so that we can follow in the footsteps of Vittorio and Bruno" (the names of the Prime Minister's two sons). Posters were plastered everywhere, proclaiming, "Everyone can gain glory in Africa." The main event of today's exercise was the Blue Army's attempt to concentrate its forces to capture Bolzano, while the Red Army fought hard to resist Toland. A motorized division, recently formed to replace the "Asti" division now in Africa, consisting of two infantry regiments, one machine gun battalion, one tank battalion, and one motorized artillery regiment, has arrived here to participate in the defense. It is generally believed that all of Italy's fast tanks will be equipped with 37mm cannons, according to experience gained from the exercise. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>Naples The steamship "Nazario Sauro," carrying eighty officers, 1,145 Fascist Party soldiers, and an artillery unit, set sail at 5:00 PM for the port of Massawa in Italian Eritrea, East Africa. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>Cairo The police authorities in Set Lane are on high alert, fearing that a conflict will break out between Italian Fascist Party members and anti-Italian groups when the Italian warship "Savoia" arrives in port. Mussolini's two sons and son-in-law are on board the "Savoia," and it is estimated that at least 1,000 party members will go to the port to welcome them. Anti-Italian groups have also announced that they will hold demonstrations, making conflict very likely. Transport through the Suez Canal increased sharply again at the end of the week. A total of seventeen Italian ships passed through on Saturday and Sunday, including one cruiser and one destroyer each. Thirteen ships heading south carried 5,000 troops and various munitions, while ships heading north carried sick soldiers from East Africa. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>

<p>Addis Ababa Daily life here is now clearly affected by the tense situation between Italy and Abyssinia. Foreign merchants are compiling inventories of their existing goods and submitting them to their respective embassies for record, so that they can be compensated in the event of war losses. Fourteen Greek and Italian families have been sent to the Dodecanese Islands in the Mediterranean by the Italian government. The National Bank of Abyssinia has announced that it will no longer disburse foreign currency, without specifying a time limit. The Emperor has decided to establish a consulate in the capital of the Kingdom of Yemen in the Arabian Peninsula. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa The National Bank of Abyssinia refused to sell foreign exchange today. Bank officials say that this measure is not indefinite. It is generally believed that this action is another indication that Abyssinia is preparing for an imminent war with Italy. It is reported that the government stopped selling foreign exchange in order to preserve all resources and prevent capital outflow. (National Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to a French source in Addis Ababa, the Abyssinian Bank announced today that it has stopped selling foreign currency, apparently due to the increasing number of foreigners leaving Abyssinia. Foreigners in Addis Ababa are migrating daily, and the Italian embassy is still moving documents. Foreign shopkeepers are now compiling inventories of their goods and intend to notify their respective national embassies. At the same time, Abyssinia has decided to establish a new embassy in Yemen. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa The authorities, in view of the large number of troops and munitions being landed and unloaded in the port of Massawa, are taking even stricter precautions. Today, they ordered the procurement of military supplies and hope to build bomb shelters. Recently, the Emperor personally warned the people about how to escape in the event of an air raid. Soon, a national air defense exercise will be held, possibly as early as next week. (National Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) The Times received a message from the capital of Abyssinia, stating, "The Emperor ordered yesterday that three artillery rounds should be fired when enemy aircraft are not attacking. At that time, people should hide in forests and grasslands to avoid danger. After learning of this order, the people of Abyssinia believe that war is imminent. The authorities are now dispatching troops to guard the warning artillery to prevent petty thieves from issuing warning signals without authorization and taking the opportunity to loot." The newspaper also stated that the unity of Abyssinia is unprecedented. The people of the Galla region, recently conquered by the country, originally a semi-independent tribe, and the Muslims there have recently sent troops to serve the King. The southern tribes, originally conquered by Emperor Menelik, are no longer rebellious. There is a popular saying in Abyssinia: "Italian Prime Minister Mussolini thinks he has captured a docile sheep, but in reality, he has encountered a porcupine." (Havas, 27th)</p>

<p>Cotton and Wheat</p>
<p>New York Cotton Market: The opening was higher today due to expectations that farmers would hoard. Cotton prices are above 10 cents. The reason for the slight increase is that the government revised its lending program, stipulating that loans would be made at 10 cents per pound, with a guarantee that cotton farmers would eventually receive a price of 12 cents. This loan is suitable for cotton of 7/8 inch or longer, so the number of US cotton bales eligible for this loan will be reduced by about 200,000 bales. All cotton produced in 1935, including what has already been sold, is eligible for this program.</p>

<p>- By Our Special Correspondent Qian Hua</p>
<p>(22) From Nanning to Longzhou</p>
<p>Longzhou is adjacent to French Vietnam and is an important border fortress in the far south. It has the Guangxi All-Border Defense and Patrol Commissioner's Office to handle border defense and diplomatic affairs, so it is the center of the province's border defense zone. The people of the country have always been very isolated from the border defense situation. Since the Northeast Incident, people of insight have gradually paid attention, but even southwestern border towns such as Longzhou are still far apart, and news is blocked. When the reporter arrived in Nanning, he planned to take a plane to inspect the border area, but unfortunately the airport was flooded, and it was not until the 16th that he took a car along the Yonglong Highway to Long. In the past, Longzhou was blocked by mountains and transportation was inconvenient. It took more than a month to reach by water, and travelers were hesitant. Recently, starting from Nanning, there is a highway by land, which only takes seven hours. By water, there are electric boats, which take two or three days when the water is high, and ten days when the water is shallow. Aviation is the Canton-Longzhou line, which only takes one hour. Education, commerce, etc. in Longzhou have gradually developed. The reporter was received by officials from the Guangxi Provincial Government. He left Nanning by car at 11:00 AM on the 16th. The entire highway is 640 li long and was built by the local militia. Although the engineering is slightly crude and the road surface and bridges are sometimes rough and uneven, and it is very easy to be damaged by floods, it is generally acceptable. Moreover, the cost is extremely low, the time is short, and the completion is rapid, which is truly commendable. There are very few plains along the entire line. Among the ten thousand mountains, the cars travel through the winding hills, and the roads rise and fall, twisting and turning. The forests are lush, and the fields are visible, as if in a wonderful landscape, forgetting the worries of the world. The car has to cross the river twice, using ferries, which takes more than an hour. Mountains protruding from the plains are everywhere. Up close, they look like rockeries made of strange stones. In the distance, they look like small islands in the sea, scattered like stars. The closer to Longzhou, the more of these strange mountains there are. Green peaks pierce the clouds, and the green is boundless, and the natural beauty is much better than artificial beauty. The car traveled for five hours to Mingjiang County. According to the person who accompanied the reception, the county town of Mingjiang was established by Di Qing when he pacified the south. His old subordinates mostly lived here and regarded themselves as descendants of meritorious officials, sitting idle and lazy to work. Bai Chongxi, Deputy Commander of the Fourth Group Army, once came here to give a speech, accusing them with righteousness. And the militia organization, all the strong men in the county had to serve in the military, and the habit of sitting idle was swept away. The population in southern Guangxi is sparse, especially in the border areas, which makes the abandoned fields along the highway all the more regrettable. Shepherds graze cattle in groups of dozens or hundreds, which proves that cattle are one of Guangxi's products. The establishment of a livestock conservation center to prevent cattle plague is especially necessary. Crossing the river from Mingjiang County to Ningming County, the mountains are heavy and the roads are even more winding. The car is also slower. When it reaches the Pingxiang County border of Longzhou, it is dark and indistinguishable from the path. It did not arrive in Longzhou until 7:30 PM and stayed at the All-Border Defense Commissioner's Office.</p>
<p>(23) The Border Defense Situation in Longzhou</p>
<p>The Guangxi border is adjacent to French Vietnam for more than 1,700 li, which is an important section of national defense in the southwest. During the Jia Shen Campaign, the fences were completely demolished. At that time, Su Yuanchun, the Guangxi Border Defense Commissioner, was honest and devoted to the country, making every effort to plan and build border defenses. The Qing court also allocated national funds to build coastal artillery platforms and barracks, deep trenches and high fortifications, and strict security. Guangxi's border defense began from this point. Since the Republic of China, the border affairs have been relaxed due to repeated turmoil. In the 21st year of the Republic of China, Li Pinxian was ordered to serve as the All-Border Defense and Patrol Commissioner, and for three years since then, he has actively reorganized border affairs, trained the militia, and resolved to let people know that we are prepared. He also adheres to a policy of good-neighborliness, with messengers coming and going, drinking and feasting together, and everything can be peaceful and tranquil on the principle of equality. After the Jia Shen War, the Regulations on Border Patrol Meetings between China and Vietnam were formulated in the 22nd year of Guangxu. The exchange between China and Vietnam was based on these regulations, which was handled by Su Yuanchun, who was also the Patrol Commissioner, who managed foreign and patrol affairs. Our side has (1) Nanguan (2) Shuikou (3) Ping'er (4) Bainan (5) Pingmeng (6) Longbang (7) Aidian (8) Nali (9) Shuolong Patrol Branch. The French side corresponding to us is (1) Siden (2) Tuolong (3) Ping'er (4) Baole (5) Shuojiang (6) Chaling (7) Zhima (8) Nashuo (9) Pingge Patrol Branch. The important task of the Patrol Branch is to jointly patrol the border with France, protect the border, and resolve disputes among border residents. At present, each patrol has a patrol police team to perform national border police duties, with more than 30 people. The Guangxi-Vietnam boundary line began to be surveyed in the 16th year of Guangxu and was completed in the 20th year. The Guangxi border was divided into east and west roads, and stone boundary markers were set up along the boundary, engraved with Chinese and French characters and marked with mileage for reference. The responsibility for the custody of the boundary markers was assigned to the respective patrol committee members and stipulated that they should be inspected once a month to see if the marker sites had been moved or the inscriptions had become blurred. Every six months, a copy of the inscription of all the boundary markers must be submitted for verification to ensure caution. At present, Longzhou has a border affairs school to cultivate specialized border affairs talents, established in the 16th year of the Republic of China. The first phase graduated in the 22nd year of the Republic of China, and after receiving military training, they were assigned to the various patrol branches for employment. After Jia Shen, Su Yuanchun built more than 100 artillery platforms of various sizes in the coastal fortresses, spending more than 5 million yuan. At present, the old rules are still maintained. Since Li took office as commissioner, he has set up factories to repair artillery platforms and other items, prepare ammunition, and dispatch soldiers to guard them separately, and send personnel to strictly inspect them at any time. As for the coastal barracks and sentry posts, many have become barren and are being repaired in stages. In addition, the coastal telephone line has also been completed, and roads can be reached everywhere. The news is sensitive, and preparations can be made quickly in the event of an alarm. At the same time, starting in November of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the first phase of graduates from the Border Affairs School were dispatched to various coastal areas to investigate the coastal security geography, which was completed in April of the 23rd year. In the future, when national funds are abundant, there will be a way to seek for border construction.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Guangdong Province: Prospects for the Sugar Industry <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since Guangdong Province implemented sugar industry control and established sugar factories to prevent economic loss, after the two new factories in Shitou started operation last December, the two Huizhou factories also started operation in January. Much information regarding past extraction and sales has been reported. Now that the sugarcane crushing season has passed, how will the province's sugar industry construction proceed? As it is a production-related undertaking, it should be of concern to the general public. Yesterday, the reporter conducted a detailed investigation and prepared a systematic overview for readers.</p>
<p>Reorganizing Sugar Factories</p>
<p>After the two new sugar factories in Shitou finished crushing sugarcane at the end of April this year, they actively engaged in repairing, reorganizing, and improving machinery. Therefore, all workers did not stop working. After the machinery was improved, the Shitou factory can crush more than 1,000 tons of sugarcane, and the Xinzhao factory can crush more than 500 tons. According to the last sugarcane crushing period, the Shitou factory had already been able to crush 1,100 tons, and the Xinzhao factory had also been able to crush 600 tons. If reorganization during this downtime is added, future improvements are self-evident.</p>
<p>Starting Sugar Refining</p>
<p>Sugar refining has now begun at the factories. Because there is no sugarcane to crush during this period, and because both the local market and other parts of the country have a great need for white sugar, the provincial government has specially obtained approval from the Ministry of Finance to import raw sugar according to regulations and pay taxes for use as refining material. At the same time, they are collecting local brown sugar for refining. Therefore, the two factories in Shitou and Xinzhao have recently started refining white sugar to meet the needs of this city and Shanghai. Some additional machinery was added to the refining process to produce fine granulated sugar. Currently, the two factories combined can produce 2,500 dan of sugar per day.</p>
<p>Improving Sugarcane Varieties</p>
<p>Regarding the improvement and propagation of sugarcane varieties, for several months, the focus has been on guiding sugarcane farmers to improve sugarcane planting methods and propagate superior sugarcane varieties. More than ten million superior sugarcane seedlings were imported last year. The yield of these superior sugarcane varieties is about twice that of local sugarcane varieties. After a year of testing, it is known that the Java 32878, 2883, 225, and Philippine varieties have excellent results. Trials were conducted in the Pearl River Delta in Panyu, the Chaoshan area, and Huizhou, and the results were all more productive than local varieties by more than double. Currently, the area of sugarcane fields in this province planted with these sugarcane varieties is approximately 8,000 mu, sufficient for the propagation for 120,000 mu of sugarcane fields. This year, because superior sugarcane varieties could not be propagated to the fullest extent, mostly local sugarcane was crushed. If the superior sugarcane varieties mature next year, then all superior sugarcane can be crushed. The cost of sugar can be reduced by about half, and farmers' harvests can be doubled. This is the situation of successful large-scale propagation of superior sugarcane varieties.</p>
<p>Contracting to Purchase Sugarcane</p>
<p>Last year, the two sugar factories signed contracts to purchase sugarcane. Large farmers throughout the province reported the sugarcane field area, but the actual area did not match the reported number. This year, three teams of surveyors were dispatched to accurately measure the sugarcane fields under contract in various places. According to reports, the sugarcane fields in various places were approximately 70,000 mu, but after measurement, the actual number was approximately 50,000 mu. Therefore, through this measurement, farmers cannot underreport. At the same time, the sugar factory can provide guidance for improvement, and the shortfall can be calculated and purchased in advance. This is an improvement in this year's sugarcane planting affairs.</p>
<p>Improving Harvesting and Transportation</p>
<p>Currently, there is active reorganization of last year's harvesting and transportation of sugarcane. Last year, the harvesting and transportation of sugarcane was contracted to merchants or large sugarcane farmers, so the work was not well-organized. Often, the sugarcane was not harvested and transported according to the date, delaying farmers' harvesting and transportation, and there were suspicions of extorting farmers. Methods are being developed to effectively ban this. In the future, farmers will harvest themselves, and the sugar factory will organize the transportation part to transport, no longer through the hands of large farmers, so as to avoid oppressing small farmers. Although each factory has suspended work for two months to reorganize the machinery, various tasks such as lending money for sugarcane planting and improving propagation of sugarcane varieties mean that the staff is very busy. Furthermore, sugarcane planting work takes place throughout the year. Before sugarcane crushing, the work regarding sugarcane planting, improving sugarcane varieties, guiding farmers to plant sugarcane, reorganizing transportation, refining sugar, investigating sugarcane fields, lending money to farmers to plant sugarcane, and distributing fertilizer and sugarcane varieties is extremely complicated and cumbersome, and must be handled during this period. Only when the sugarcane crushing season arrives can the sugar production work proceed quickly.</p>
<p>Reorganizing Huizhou Factory</p>
<p>The Huizhou Military Reclamation Sugar Factory planted local sugarcane last year, and because it suffered flood disasters, the quality was not very good. At the same time, the harvesting and transportation work was new, the new machinery installation was sloppy, and the staff was not very skilled. Therefore, the sugarcane crushing was slightly hindered. However, the Honolulu Iron Works Co., Ltd. is now fully responsible for repairing the machinery. When it starts operating this year, it is expected to be able to crush more than 1,000 tons. The sugarcane variety improvement in the area has also been very successful. Each mu of the new varieties can yield more than 300 dan. However, the existing sugarcane field area is very small, only 400 mu. If it can be propagated successively, except for crushing for one more year this year, all superior sugarcane varieties can be crushed next year. At that time, the benefits may exceed those of the two factories in Shitou and Xinzhao.</p>
<p>Preparing New Factories</p>
<p>Currently, the Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry is preparing for the Shunde and Chaoshan sugar factories according to the agreements. The Shunde factory is being built by the Skoda Works, and the Chaoshan factory is being built by the Honolulu Iron Works Co., Ltd. At the same time, preparations are being made to purchase sugarcane to supply the sugar factories with raw materials at the end of the year. Shunde is using the method of the First Construction Site in the Guangzhou area to lend money to farmers to plant sugarcane. The method in Chaoshan is to locally convene sugarcane merchants to organize and purchase sugarcane from farmers according to the purchase agreement and price value approved by the government to supply the sugarcane factory. It is expected that both factories can be completed on schedule, and there will be no shortage of raw material sugarcane.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Guangdong Province Eastern Border: Establishing Joint Defense Zones with Police and Guards, Organizing Joint Defense Committees in Each Zone to be Responsible for Bandit Suppression and Bandit Information Investigation <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Recently, Guangdong Province believes that although the bandits in the neighboring provinces have been suppressed, there are still remnants of bandits gathering in the remote areas with dense mountains and forests. In order to consolidate the border, the authorities have been mobilizing military engineers to build border anti-bandit trenches, and at the same time, they have been instructing the counties along the Guangdong border to organize joint defense in various townships, conduct household registration, and investigate bandit traces to prevent bandits from infiltrating. Regarding the defense of the border areas, the Fifth and Sixth Division engineers are responsible for constructing the trenches from the Xiaobei River to the Hunan-Guangxi border, the Independent Second Brigade engineers are responsible for the trenches from the Nanxiong Xihe coast to the Jiangxi border, the Forty-First Division engineers are responsible for the highways and border trenches from Shaozhou to Wengyuan and other counties, and the Independent First Division engineers are responsible for the trenches from Jiaoling to the Fujian border. As for the eastern region, because there are still remnants of bandits from the Fujian border appearing, the military authorities, in order to carefully maintain order in the border areas, issued the joint defense regulations for the counties in the border areas yesterday. In each county in the border area, joint defense zones will be established, with two to several counties, or a certain area of a county and a certain area of a neighboring county, jointly establishing a joint defense committee, so that when there is an alarm, they can command the guard teams within the joint defense zone. The joint defense committee has one director and one deputy director, appointed by the Pacification Headquarters and the defense army commander. Recently, joint defense zones have been established in Raoping and Meixian in the eastern region. There is the Pudong Pubei Joint Defense Association, with the defense army regiment commander and Zhang Wuzhen, a member of the Dabu County Government, as the director of the Pudong Joint Defense, and Zhong Que Lian as the director of the Pubei Joint Defense. After the establishment of the joint defense zone in the area, they immediately began investigating bandit information. The investigation items are roughly as follows: (1) Bandit leader's name, (2) Number of bandits, (3) Types and number of bandit firearms, (4) Bandit gathering location, (5) Survey and map of the bandit nest location, detailing the situation and access routes, (6) Public security conditions. If there is a bandit alarm in the joint defense zone, the guard teams in the joint defense zone must cooperate in the blockade, regardless of their jurisdiction. When the defense army suppresses bandits, the guard teams in the area must also do their best to assist, so as to achieve mutual assistance between the military and the people. (August 23)</p>

<h3 id="e97">Confucius' Daily Life and Interpretation of Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Honor (Continued) <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— H. H. Kung</p>
<p>Different Schools of Thought from Confucius</p>
<p>The School of Transmitting the Way is the ancestor of Song Learning; the School of Transmitting the Classics is the ancestor of Han Learning; the School of Transmitting Propriety belongs to the School of Transmitting the Classics; the School of Harmony between Heaven and Man is also attached to the School of Transmitting the Way and the School of Transmitting the Classics. Thus, the academic thought of China over the past two thousand years has always regarded these two schools as the two main trends. Whether they are the true learning of Confucius is still questionable. In the past (Note 12), Mr. Yan Xizhai once wanted to destroy the framework and clarify it. As for Confucius' treatment of Zilu's governance, he told him to be cautious in doing things, to like planning, and to achieve success; because of Ran You's enriching the people, he spoke of equality without poverty and harmony without scarcity; and because Zigong was a talent who could be sent in all directions, when he asked about scholars, he prioritized having shame and not being disgraced. The essence lies in this, and the foundation of the country depends on it. If showing benevolence was already shown to Yan Yuan, then expelling the barbarians still made him think of Guan Zhong. The big picture and the well-being of the people go hand in hand. The students are good at driving (such as Fan Chi driving and Ran You serving), and they should diligently study archery and chariot driving. Striving for the Way and engaging in the arts should be pursued together. And filial piety, friendship, following the law, chivalry, accumulating wealth, solitary actions, farming together, and the study of rectification of names all originated at this time. Later generations should adapt to the times, seek truth from facts, and not be like the previous moralists (pedants) and Confucian scholars (Han scholars), each claiming to be the true learning of Confucius and having the concepts of "orthodox lineage" and "academic lineage."</p>

<h3 id="e98">Yesterday Was the Birthday of Confucius, and Various Sectors Held Commemorative Meetings <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>More than 1,000 People Attended the People's Education Center, and the Ceremony Was Grand. Various Agencies, Organizations, and Schools Raised Flags and Took a Holiday</p>
<p>August 27th is the nationally designated Confucius Birthday Commemoration Day. All sectors of the city held a Confucius Birthday Commemoration Meeting at 10:00 AM in the Dacheng Hall of the Municipal People's Education Center on Wenmiao Road. More than 1,000 representatives attended, and the ceremony was particularly grand and the atmosphere was extremely warm. All agencies, organizations, and schools raised flags to celebrate and took a day off. The details of the Commemorative Meeting are recorded below:</p>
<p>Arrangement</p>
<p>The Confucius Birthday Commemoration Meeting held by representatives from all sectors of Shanghai was held in the Dacheng Hall of the Municipal People's Education Center on Wenmiao Road, in front of the shrine of Confucius. The Party and National Flags were hung on the left and right, and the portrait of the President was hung in the middle. The portrait of Confucius was placed on the incense table in front of the shrine. In front of the portrait, there was a square table with two vases of flowers. Slogans were posted on all the pillars in the hall, and small Party and National Flags were hung in a cross shape in the air. The stage in front of the hall was occupied by the orchestra of the Commemorative Meeting and the military band of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Another Party and National Flag were hung high in front of the stage. A horizontal plaque was hung at the gate of the People's Education Center, with the words "Confucius Birthday Commemoration Meeting Held by Representatives from All Sectors of Shanghai." The Municipal Public Security Bureau dispatched additional police officers to maintain order on Wenmiao Road. Several staff members from the Municipal Party Headquarters stood at the entrance, and all participating representatives had to have their letters verified. All tourists to the People's Education Center were refused entry.</p>
<p>Order</p>
<p>(1) All stand at attention, (2) Play music (Municipal Public Security Bureau Military Band), (3) Sing the Party Song, (4) Bow three times to the Party and National Flags, the President's portrait, and the portrait of Confucius, (5) The chairman respectfully reads the President's will, (6) Sacrifice to Confucius and present flowers, (7) Chairman's report, (8) Speech, (9) Sing the Confucius Commemorative Song, (10) Play music and dismiss the meeting.</p>
<p>Staff</p>
<p>The presidium of the meeting was composed of Wu Tiecheng (represented by Pan Gongzhan) of the Municipal Government, Tong Xingbai of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Yang Xiaotian of the Security Office, Yu Zhenhui of the Municipal Farmers' Association, Ye Xianggao of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Huang Zaoxiong of the Municipal Education Association, and Wang Dasui of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. The master of ceremonies was Peng Quji, the recorder was Du Mengsen, and the director of reception was Li Dachao. There were also ushers and security guards such as Zhang Yuliang. All were on duty at the site.</p>
<p>Presenting Flowers</p>
<p>After the ceremony was conducted as scheduled, Chairman Pan Gongzhan first performed the ritual of sacrificing to Confucius and presenting flowers. Pan walked to the incense table, bowed once to the portrait of Confucius, then respectfully presented a bouquet of flowers with both hands, bowed again to the portrait of Confucius, inserted the flowers into the vase, and retreated with three bows. At that time, the Datong Orchestra played music three times and ended.</p>
<p>Report</p>
<p>After the Confucius worship ceremony, Chairman Pan Gongzhan gave a report, briefly stating that he was representing Mayor Wu in reporting the significance of commemorating Confucius. The Central Government designated August 27th as the Confucius Birthday Commemoration Day last year, and it has been held every year since. Now that the Chinese nation is on the verge of crisis, it is essential to promote China's inherent morality. China has a history of more than 4,000 years, and there are many sages worthy of respect and worship, but Confucius is the most important. Confucius was the greatest sage in Chinese history who carried on the past and opened up the future. Confucius was born in the Spring and Autumn Period. At that time, Chinese scholarship and civilization were very developed, and Confucius inherited all the sacred ways of the past and inspired all the scholarship and morality of the future. Confucius was a sage of his time. The so-called time means continuous flow, and it is all-encompassing and all-inclusive. Therefore, his learning was profound and his morality was noble, truly worthy of worship and respect for all generations. Today, China's inherent morality has been in decline for a long time, causing the national spirit to slump. Therefore, in order to save it, Confucius' morality and scholarship should be re-emphasized and promoted.</p>

<p>Speech</p>
<p>After the Chairman's report, Tong Xingbai gave a speech, briefly stating that Confucius was a great sage revered by all generations in China. Now the National Government has designated August 27th as the nationally designated Confucius Birthday Commemoration Day because Confucius' morality and scholarship are truly worthy of worship by all ages. Due to the environmental factors of the time, some of the doctrines created by Confucius may not be in line with today's trends, but we should know that material things can be improved, doctrines can be changed, but truth is eternal. The truth that Confucius revealed to us, even for thousands of years, should not be denied by anyone, and should be followed by us for all generations. Confucius is the foundation of the Chinese nation's spirit, so in order to promote China's inherent national spirit, we should strive to promote Confucius' scholarship and morality. After Tong's speech, the Confucius Commemorative Song was sung, music was played, and the meeting was dismissed.</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government convened all county government staff yesterday to hold a commemorative meeting in the government auditorium to mark the Confucius Birthday Commemoration on the 27th of this month. More than 100 people attended. County Magistrate Ye Zhendong presided over the meeting. First, the Chairman reported the significance of the commemoration, and then the County Education Bureau Director Zhu Changlin and others gave speeches on Confucius' scholarship and morality. The meeting then adjourned. In addition, all prosperous towns such as Minhang, Zhuanqiao, Beiqiao, Maqiao, Sanlin, and Chenhang in Pudong West and other counties of the county also raised flags to celebrate and held separate commemorative meetings.</p>

<p>Mr. Gu Weijun, the Chinese Minister to France, needed to consult with the concurrently serving Foreign Minister on official matters. Therefore, yesterday at 4:00 PM, accompanied by his secretary Shi Zhaokui, and his brother Gu Weixin, he took the Shanghai-Beiping train to Beijing to pay his respects. According to what Minister Gu told Central News Agency reporters at the station, this year's League of Nations Assembly has been scheduled for September 10th in Geneva. He, along with the Ambassador to the UK, Guo Taiqi, and the Ambassador to Soviet Russia, Yan Huiqing, were appointed as the representatives. Both Guo and Yan are currently in Europe and will rush to attend before the meeting. He himself, due to unfinished domestic affairs and insufficient time, has decided to cancel his trip. Furthermore, there are no major cases to be presented by China at this year's League of Nations Assembly. Regarding China's request to obtain a permanent seat on the Council of the League of Nations, Representative Guo is already in Europe negotiating with various countries. The elevation of the Chinese and French envoys still awaits the approval of the French Parliament before it can be decided. The date of his return to France to resume his post will be decided after a face-to-face discussion with concurrently serving Foreign Minister Wang. He will stay in Beijing for one day before returning to Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e102">It is Reported that Fu Rulin Returned to Beijing Yesterday - Fundamental Measures for Flood Control <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Fu Rulin, Chairman of the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission, came to Shanghai this time to pay his respects to Finance Minister Kong and Hubei Provincial Government Chairman Zhang Qun to discuss disaster relief for the Yangtze River floods. He has completed his official duties and took the Shanghai-Beiping train back to Beijing yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. A Central News Agency reporter met Mr. Fu at the station yesterday and inquired about the future progress of water conservancy and disaster relief for the Yangtze River. According to him, he first went to Avenue Seehaye this morning (i.e., yesterday morning) to pay his respects to Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi to discuss disaster relief funds. Then, he visited Zhang Qun, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, on Avenue Albert, to discuss the Yangtze River water conservancy and disaster relief issues in Hubei Province, and considerable results have been achieved. The Yangtze River flood this time affected a wide area, and there are many disaster victims awaiting relief. The Hubei Provincial Government has requested a disaster relief fund of 5 million yuan from the Central Government. How to raise this amount is still under discussion. It is expected that the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Railways will provide considerable assistance. Other fundraising methods are still under consideration. Only after the urgent relief matters are resolved can we talk about agricultural and industrial relief. As for the future progress of water conservancy for the Yangtze River, it is still under active research. In recent years, the Yangtze River has flooded almost every flood season, causing frequent floods of various sizes. Therefore, the water conservancy problem can no longer be delayed. Raising the river dikes to prevent overflow is a temporary emergency measure and not a fundamental solution. Nie Yufu, the water conservancy expert from the League of Nations who was previously invited, came to China to inspect the Yangtze River and Yellow River water conservancy and believed that raising the dike body year by year was not a long-term solution and could lead to endless troubles. The fundamental solution for water management is to dredge the waterways on the one hand and to excavate tributaries on both sides of the river on the other. He greatly agrees with Mr. Nie's proposal and believes that dredging the waterways is the only essential step in water management. How to proceed is currently under research and discussion. As for the fundamental disaster relief measures proposed by Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Relief Commission, they are also under study.</p>

<p>According to Dagong News Agency, since the Xihu Long-Distance Bus Company started operating on the 17th of this month, it has been quite crowded with passengers. The company is now offering an additional 20% discount on top of the existing 20% discount on fares, starting from September 1st, to ease the burden on passengers, due to rural bankruptcy and economic difficulties for people in the interior. A reporter from Dagong News Agency obtained the following details from the company yesterday:</p>
<p>Business Overview Since the opening of the Xihu Bus Company on the 17th of this month, it has been ten days until yesterday. The company's full-line operations have sold an average of approximately 1,500 yuan in tickets. Among them, the Shanghai-Changshu, Wuxi-Changshu, Suzhou-Changshu, Shanghai-Taicang, and Jiading routes are more crowded with passengers. Currently, the Xihu Road has been slightly damaged due to the large number of vehicles traveling on the opening day. The Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department's Highway Administration has ordered repairs to be completed, and the vehicles currently traveling on it are extremely stable.</p>
<p>Company Announcement The company originally planned to sell tickets for 3 cents per kilometer. During the opening period, a 20% discount was generally offered to show preferential treatment. Recently, in light of commercial depression and rural bankruptcy, and to reduce the burden on passengers, it has been decided to offer another 20% discount on fares starting from September 1st. The company issued an announcement stating: "Rural areas are bankrupt, affecting cities. At this time of autumn harvest, our company, in consideration of the economic situation of the masses, will specially reduce all ticket prices starting from September 1st to ease the burden and benefit the people. This is a special announcement."</p>
<p>Reduced Fares Starting from September 1st, the company will reduce all fares on all lines by 20% across the board, on top of the previously stipulated 20% discount. Therefore, the average fare is only slightly less than 2 cents per kilometer. The following is an excerpt of the reduced fares for important towns: (2) Shanghai to Nanxiang is 3 dimes, to Jiading is 5 dimes and 6 cents, to Taicang is 9 dimes, to Changshu is 1 yuan and 7 dimes, to Wuxi is 2 yuan and 6 dimes, Suzhou to Changshu is 7 dimes.

<p>Vietnam</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese General Labor Union, in response to the illegal discrimination against Chinese by the Siamese government, sent separate telegrams to the Central Government and the association the other day, requesting the implementation of a boycott of Siamese rice, stating: "The Siamese government does not treat our Overseas Chinese with equality.

If Overseas Chinese workers lose their jobs as a result, our association will unite with compatriots at home and abroad to seek effective relief. Although our country's rice supply is insufficient, the main sources of rice have been Siam, Annam, and Burma.

<p>According to the Central News Agency, since the preparation of the Central Bank Trust Bureau, the duties of each office have been planned. According to a reporter's inquiry yesterday, the official opening date of the bureau is approximately in the middle of next month. The articles of association have been largely drafted, and they will be announced after President Kong approves them. The rumor of opening on September 1st is not timely. After the establishment of the bureau, it will handle construction investment, civil servant savings, and manage American wheat and cotton loans. For the time being, it is not planned to take charge of the control of national food transportation and sales. The acceptance of the China-France Savings Society, the China Industrial Bank, and the International Savings Society's prize savings will be handled by a separate central savings department. Because this type of savings is widespread throughout the country and is of great importance, it should be handled solemnly to maintain the interests of the people and national sovereignty. Currently, the savings department of the Trust Bureau specializes in handling the savings of civil servants, which is different in nature from the savings of various banks.

<p>The first term of the city's municipal literacy schools, consisting of one hundred and ten schools, commenced on July 1st. After the summer break, the term ends at the end of the month. An examination will be held simultaneously in all districts on September 1st. Those who pass will be granted graduation and issued an initial popular education certificate. Those who fail will be ordered to take remedial classes or repeat the term. The second term, consisting of one hundred and twenty schools, is scheduled to begin on September 5th. The original term duration was set at two months, but due to the complexity of the curriculum and for the sake of teaching effectiveness, it has been decided to extend it to three months starting from the second term. Regarding the school buildings for the literacy schools, during the first term, many schools were on summer vacation, so classrooms were mostly borrowed from those schools. Now that all schools have resumed classes, it is inconvenient to borrow classrooms. The Education Bureau has already instructed all schools that, except for the first term, which can continue until September 1st, the second term literacy schools may borrow the school's auditorium, dining hall, and covered playground, etc. The city’s elementary schools in the vicinity, including Chaozong, Cangji, Xicheng, Songxue, Shihua, Danhua, Jingye, Dongming, Yangzheng, Wanzhu, Longde, Tangjia, Chongzheng, Xunxing, Nanxun, Gaochang, Nongtan, Dexin, Yongxing, Xinmin, Tanzhen, Pengnan, North [unclear], Haishan, Qimei, Caonan, Zhuan, Yucai, Qiuxi, Hongzhen, Yinxi, Zhougang, Yangsi, Tangnan, Tangxi, Gaoqiao, Juehui, Sha [unclear], Wusong, Wanbei, Peiji, Qiujiang, Xijiang, Luge, Hongxi, Wangjia [unclear], Shicun, Yuxiang, Zhengzhong, Nongcun, Dongxin, Mei [unclear], Qiuzhi, Long [unclear], Shangwen and other schools are said to be involved.</p>

<p>Heavy rain fell again at 2 a.m. yesterday, and stopped after about half an hour. At about 3 a.m., heavy rain continued to fall, and the rain was torrential. All the roads were flooded due to the inability to drain the water. At 0:10 p.m., floating clouds passed the sun, and it rained again for a moment. After the rain, the sunshine was sometimes hidden and sometimes visible, and the heat and humidity did not abate.</p>
<p>Buildings Along the Street</p>
<p>The Zhu Yisheng Cotton Shop at No. 563 Tibet Road is a single-bay building along the road. The shop owner's wife, Zhu Zhang, is from Longhua and is 43 years old. The shop is operated jointly by her eldest son, Jin Gui (22 years old), her second son, Sheng Gen (14 years old), and her husband's elder brother, Zhu Defa (53 years old).</p>
<p>Sudden Collapse</p>
<p>In addition to the shop downstairs facing the street, the kitchen behind it is used as a bedroom. The upper floor is rented out to others. Above the kitchen is the balcony of the upper floor.

<p>The family is unwilling to collect the body; it is collected by the Pushan Cemetery</p>
<p>A Japanese police officer at the Yulin Road Police Station No. 218, at about 2 p.m. on the 25th of this month, was learning to drive a cargo truck No. 16916 on Andong Road from south to north. The driver of the car, Chen Ar-er (from Yangzhou, residing at No. 4661, Robertson Road), sat beside him to instruct him on driving skills. Unexpectedly, several coolie children living nearby were playing there, seeing that the car was not moving very fast, they gathered around it and walked around it for fun. Among them was Huang Anzhong's son, named Daxi, who was only twelve years old. He tried to grab the iron bar on the side of the car, but his hand slipped and he fell to the ground immediately. He was crushed by the rear wheel of the car and was seriously injured. The Japanese police officer knew about it and quickly applied the brakes, but it was too late. The Yulin Road Police Station was notified, and an ambulance was called to rush the child to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and he died soon after. Chinese and Western detectives went to investigate. They carried the child's body to the Feilun Road autopsy office. Yesterday morning, they reported to the First Special District Local Court, which appointed Prosecutor Tang, together with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi, etc., to come to the office to examine the body. First, the Western police chief informed him of the previous situation and said that the driver of the car, Chen Ar-er, had been sent to the First Special Court for custody, so that an investigation could be carried out. According to the witness Feng Suohai, a 19-year-old peddler from Nantong, he was passing by the area that day and saw the deceased hanging on the iron bar of the car when the car was turning, and then fell to the ground and was crushed by the car. According to the Japanese police officer No. 218, named Neng Qi Yu, 24 years old, residing at No. 227 Huasheng Road, he did not have a driver's license and did not know how to drive. On that day, the driver agreed to instruct me on the side, but I did not see the deceased hanging on the side of the car, slipping and falling to the ground and being crushed by the car. According to the corpse's father, Huang Anzhong, who lives in a straw shed with no number on Longjiang Road and makes a living by working, he only knew that the deceased went out to buy things that day, and did not know that he was crushed by a car, so he asked for justice. Tang Jun believed that the police had not found any fault with the driver of the car, etc., and did not file a public prosecution. The Japanese police officer and the driver Chen Ar-er were willing to contribute to the cost of the coffin because the family of the deceased was poor, but the corpse's father did not want to accept it and refused to collect the body. Tang Jun then issued an order that the deceased Huang Daxi, male, was indeed crushed to death by a 16916 truck before his death. The deceased's father, Huang Anzhong, came to the scene and claimed that he did not want to collect the body. The body was handed over to the Pushan Cemetery for collection.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Private Shipping Companies Implement Steward Reform <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Following the China Merchants Bureau to Vigorously Implement the New Movement; Those Found Demanding Tips for Liquor are Immediately Dismissed</p>
<p>Since the Nanchang New Life Movement General Association ordered all shipping companies to implement New Life training and vigorously carry out reforms, in addition to the state-owned China Merchants Bureau, which has already started training stewards, other private companies are also actively carrying out reforms. A reporter from the Central News Agency explored the situation from the Shipping Association as follows:</p>
<p>Post Slogans; Ban Liquor Tips</p>
<p>The implementation of the New Life Movement by private shipping companies dates back to April this year. At that time, the Public Security Bureau and the authorities of each company selected important slogans from the New Movement and posted them everywhere in the South City to arouse the attention of stewards and passengers. Recently, the shipping companies, in view of the convenience felt by passengers after the China Merchants Bureau's Xinjiangtianyu was reformed, are now trying to ban liquor tips in order to compete.</p>
<p>Cold Water Stewards Automatically Disappear</p>
<p>The shipping companies that have implemented the ban on liquor tips include Ningxin, Xin Ningshao, Xin Hongxing, etc. The company authorities stipulate that if a steward still demands tips for liquor, he will be immediately dismissed upon discovery. This system is very effective. In the future, cold water class stewards will have no profit to make after this system is implemented and will inevitably disappear. Recently, Yan Baohang, secretary of the New Life Movement General Association, went to the Shipping Association to explain everything. The association expressed its strong approval and will follow the China Merchants Bureau to work hard to carry out the reforms.</p>
<p>Steward Training Postponed</p>
<p>The training of stewards is temporarily not implemented because private companies have many difficulties. However, if the China Merchants Bureau's results are satisfactory in the future, they will also follow suit. The ban on liquor tips can also be implemented in the Yangtze River basin in the near future. In the future, stewards who are not registered with the company authorities will be strictly prohibited from boarding the ship. In this way, it will not only vigorously promote the New Movement, but also provide great convenience to passengers.</p>

<p>Han Jinshan Dies Unjustly, Han Guomou Flees Overnight</p>
<p>Han Jinshan (38 years old), a villager from Hankai Village, Hedong, Cherry Township, about six li east of Minhang Town in the southwest of this county, was washing doors and windows by a small river next to the threshing ground in front of his house at around 10 AM the day before yesterday (25th). At that time, his cousin Han Guomou (29 years old) was climbing a white jujube tree on the house foundation's threshing ground to pick white jujubes (Note: There are four jujube trees planted on the threshing ground, jointly owned by the Han clan). Han Jinshan saw this and, believing that the white jujubes were not yet ripe, shouted to stop him. Han Guomou, hearing the sound, became angry out of embarrassment and immediately climbed down the tree. Without asking why, he punched Han Jinshan. Unexpectedly, the blow struck a vital point, and Han Jinshan fell to the ground, unable to get up. Clan members, hearing the sound, came out to mediate and helped Han Jinshan back to his house, where he lay on the bed, groaning incessantly. Before an hour had passed, a tragic cry was heard, and he died. The murderer, Han Guomou, fled into the night without a trace. Clan members gathered to report to the authorities for an inquest. However, because the deceased's wife, Han Wang, had rushed back to her mother's house in Zhudi Town before the incident, there was no one to handle the matter. Therefore, someone was sent to urge Han Wang to return home to take charge. Thus, it was not until yesterday afternoon that Hu Jingmei, the head of the 21st Bao 7th Tu, and the deceased's brother, Han Runshu, reported to the local court to request an inquest. Magistrate Lei Binzhang of the Inspection Office summoned the case and, after questioning, instructed the Bao to wait at the scene of the death, awaiting the inquest.</p>

<p>Cao Dexin, the owner of Hehua Cigarette Paper Store at No. 159, Longhua Road, Nanshi, was opening his shop at 5:30 AM yesterday morning when three robbers suddenly arrived. One robber was wearing a blue cloth shirt, and two were wearing white cloth shirts. Speaking with an out-of-town accent, they broke into the shop and robbed 1,800 copper coins from the counter. At that time, Tang Yaocuan, a 16-year-old apprentice from Changzhou, was returning from fetching water outside when he saw the robbers robbing and shouted for help. Unexpectedly, one of the robbers wearing a white cloth shirt shot him twice, hitting him in the head, and he immediately fell to the ground and died. Seeing that they had caused a disaster, the robbers scattered and fled with the stolen goods. The shop owner, Cao Dexin, reported to the Gaochangmiao Police Station, which forwarded the report to the Ximen Branch for investigation. Branch Chief Li ordered Detective Squad Leader Shen Wenda and Detective Liu Wenhui to go to the scene for investigation. They found two shell casings and took them back to the station for filing and a strict investigation. They also ordered the local Bao to report to the local court for an inquest. Yesterday afternoon at 1 PM, the court sent a prosecutor to the scene for an inquest. He confirmed that the death was caused by a gunshot wound to the head. In addition to completing the death certificate and ordering the arrest of the fleeing robbers to be brought to justice, he also ordered the shop owner to prepare a coffin for burial.</p>

<p>Huang Liansheng Accused of Interfering with Marriage, Lu Zhenying Claims She Was Deceived and Imprisoned</p>
<p>Lu Bingsheng, a tailor from Pudong at No. 1126, Dongyouheng Road, has a daughter named Zhenying, 29 years old and somewhat attractive. On October 14 two years ago, at a wedding banquet at the home of his relative Zhu Agen, she met Huang Yunsheng, a fellow villager from Chuansha. They fell in love at first sight. In January of the following year, Huang took advantage of an opportunity to take the woman to the Pingqiao Hotel on Xizang Road, where they rented a room and slept together. The woman's father was completely unaware. At that time, Huang was learning how to make new-style suitcases in Cangji Street, Nanshi. Recently, he lost his job and went to Lu's house, saying that the woman's tailoring business had very little profit, and it would be better to cooperate with him in the suitcase business, which could yield a large profit. Lu happily agreed and abandoned his old business to learn this kind of work. From then on, Huang stayed at their house and secretly engaged in illicit affairs with the woman. However, the new-style small suitcases they made could not be sold on the market and no one asked about them. Their capital was stranded, and Huang secretly borrowed clothes and farm implements from the woman. Unable to gain a foothold, at around 7 AM on the 17th of this month, he tricked the woman into going to his house in Chuansha, Pudong, where they lived as husband and wife. After his daughter disappeared, Lu Bingsheng learned that Huang Liansheng had abducted her and that they were living together in Chuansha. The day before yesterday, Bingsheng went to the place where Huang's parents agreed to bring Liansheng and Zhenying home for a discussion, and a big quarrel ensued. Chinese police officer and detective Huang Fugen from No. 2039 inquired about the whole story. Lu Bingsheng then brought Huang Liansheng to the Huishan Police Station for overnight detention. The next morning, he was escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District. Wang Yaotang, a lawyer at the Bureau of Works, explained the previous situation and filed a public prosecution in accordance with Article 241, Section 3 of the Criminal Law, for the crime of interfering with marriage and family. Subsequently, Lu Bingsheng claimed that his daughter had been promised to someone else and could not marry the defendant. The woman, Zhenying, said that she had asked the defendant for three pieces of clothing that had been pawned that morning. He said that he had to go to his home in Chuansha to return them in full, and she was deceived. Afterwards, she was imprisoned in a room and not allowed to go outside. When questioned, the defendant claimed that the woman had followed him back to his hometown voluntarily. He was evasive about the rest and asked for leniency. Judge Jiang Shuzi ruled that he would remain in custody pending sentencing.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Two Children Scalded to Death by Hot Water <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Ma Wenhua, a 34-year-old sock merchant from Nanxiang, lives in his hometown. His wife, Zhu, from Shaoxing, had four children, but only one son, Ma Dejian, survived. When their third child died, Zhu became even more resentful and unhappy all day long, which was evident on her face. Her husband took her and his son, Dejian, to Shanghai to live in his mother-in-law's house at No. 8, Xingyi Lane, No. 545, Kangnuot Road, in order to relieve her depression. However, at around 9 AM on the 21st of this month, Dejian was playing in the living room when he accidentally knocked over a kettle of boiling water placed on the floor. At that time, the child's aunt, Zhu Yunmei, who was holding her two-year-old son, Zhu Yun, was also having breakfast there. Seeing this, she rushed to rescue them, but due to panic, she slipped and fell to the ground. As a result, both the woman and the child were scalded by the boiling water. After being seen by family members, the two children were immediately sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment. Yunmei suffered only minor injuries to her legs at the time, so she was not sent to the hospital. However, one of the children died because of their severe injuries, which could not be saved. The hospital reported to the Gordon Road Police Station, which ordered detective Gao Huixian to investigate. The two corpses were taken to the Feilun Road Morgue on the previous two days. Chen Shandong, the head of the Chinese police at the police station, reported to the First Special District Local Court, which dispatched prosecutors Guo and Tang to the morgue to confirm that the two children had died from being scalded by boiling water. They then ordered the families of the deceased to sign statements and take the bodies back for burial.</p>

<p>Some of the Arrested New Workers Released, the Rest Sent to Local Court for Trial</p>
<p>Xin Sheng She reports: Regarding the fight over work between stevedores at the Shanghai North Station of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, the 130+ old workers submitted a written request to the Railway Bureau after the incident the day before yesterday: (1) Cancel the "wild chicken" (i.e., temporary) workers and guarantee the work of the old workers. (2) Do not reduce wages. (3) Do not dismiss workers without reason. The Railway Bureau has given it consideration. At the same time, the workers sent representatives to Beijing to petition the authorities to stop Sun Zhu's attempt to seize work.</p>
<p>Military Police on Alert</p>
<p>At around 8 AM yesterday morning, more than 30 new workers were seen loitering and scouting around the intersection of Jiaotong Road and Qiujiang Road. The Yongxing Road Police Station immediately dispatched armed police officers to patrol the Baoshan Road, Qiujiang Road, and Jiaotong Road areas near the storage facilities. At the same time, the 9th Team of the Security Force of the two police stations also dispatched military police to guard the station. Seeing the strict security, the new workers dispersed at around 10 AM. However, the military police remained on alert throughout the day, until 8 PM, when all was quiet and they withdrew.</p>
<p>Workers Released</p>
<p>Some of the new workers arrested and interrogated the day before yesterday were released after Xiao Weiguo, the director of the Traffic Office, provided written proof. Sun Zhu, Shi Jiezhi, and others were released at noon the day before yesterday. Li Defa and Wang Changhai, two old workers, were arrested for accompanying Sun Zhu to the police station and have not been released. Therefore, the workers decided to ask the two-way party headquarters for assistance this morning. Shi Gaoxiang, Yang Dacheng, Meng Hongqi, and the "wild chicken" workers Wang Jiaqing, Bao Konghua, Gu Jinbang, Ding Fugen, Wang Hongzhang, Xie Chenggong, Xu Dasheng, and others are scheduled to be sent to the local court for trial today.</p>
<p>Railway Bureau News</p>
<p>Regarding the fight between stevedores at the Shanghai North Station freight yard of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, one side of the workers is from the North Station Stevedore Cooperative, and the other side is the temporary workers who have always been at the station. There are no so-called new workers. The incompatibility between the cooperative and the temporary workers has a long history. In recent months, there have been more than 20 fights, which have not only hurt both workers but also affected cargo transportation, causing complaints from merchants. The Traffic Office of the Railway Bureau, in order to maintain cargo transportation, has submitted a request to appoint Sun Zhu to be responsible for the reorganization. The cause of the incident the day before yesterday was that cooperative workers and temporary workers met on Jiaotong Road and, because of their old grudges, attacked each other. More and more people gathered, leading to a tragic incident in which both sides were injured. However, reports that a certain worker was beaten to death are completely false rumors deliberately spread by a certain party.</p>

Wu Jichen, in particular, was brave and diligent in promoting and distributing the Tripitaka. He passed away on the 20th of this month due to illness. In his dying wish, he requested that a copy of the Tripitaka be purchased and donated to Chao'an Temple in Zhenjiang for eternal offering. His lifelong devotion is unparalleled and in harmony with the Buddha's light. Zhu and Ye have specially written a memorial poem and a mourning couplet to express their sorrow and admiration. The memorial words for Layman Wu Jichen are as follows:</p>
<p>"The public's faith in the Buddha, is unwavering; The Buddha's embrace of the public, endures for countless kalpas. This association, is a model for our followers; Wishing to help it reach completion, why not wait a moment? Considering the public's sincerity, how can ink and paper fully depict it? May this Tripitaka be protected without end, and may the surname be engraved forever in the Qisha district."</p>
<p>The couplet reads:</p>
<p>"Protecting the golden scripture through many battles, this wish is about to be fulfilled, the kalpa is fleeting, the public cannot wait; A building is completed as a pure land, rebirth is easy, anxieties and worries fill the world, how can it be endured."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Bar Association submitted a document to the Shanghai Second Special District Local Court yesterday, requesting the expansion of the lawyer's lounge. Most of the members of the association claimed that the lawyer's lounge set up by the Shanghai Second Special District Local Court was too small. When members came to court to appear in court, they often had nowhere to rest and had to wait outside. This was both unsightly and inconvenient and should be expanded. It was proposed that the outdoor corridor, that is, the area at the bottom of the escalator, was usually unused, and it would be appropriate to use it to expand the lawyer's rest room. It would not affect the use of the original land of the court, and a proposal was submitted to the court for expansion. The situation described by the members is indeed the fact and should be expanded. We hereby request your court to allow the use of the outdoor corridor for the expansion of the lawyer's rest. As for the cost, it should be borne by the association. It should be submitted to your court for review and approval, which would be in the public interest.</p>

<p>Zheng Baolin, also known as Caixi, a 24-year-old man from Jiangbei, living at No. 24, Nande Shunli, Runni Ferry, Peidong, had an affair with Chen Renzhen, a 22-year-old woman from Yangzhou. Being unable to support her, he discussed the matter with the woman and obtained her consent to pawn her into prostitution at the Cantonese brothel run by Zhao Changrong (20 years old this year) at No. 1 Hemingli, Weier Meng Road, French Concession, for a price of 200 yuan, with a term of one and a half years. Half a year has passed since she was pawned. However, driven by lust, Zheng would often summon the woman to go out and meet in hotels. This caused annoyance to the madam and others, leading to disagreements. On the 17th of this month, at around 10 p.m., Zheng was suddenly attacked by several thugs wielding axes in Yu's residence, Lane 168, Huage Nie Road, French Concession, and suffered injuries to his body and legs. The assailants fled in a panic. Zheng glanced back and saw Zhao Changrong, the owner of the brothel, standing nearby. Suspecting Zhao of instigating the attack, Zheng dragged Zhao to the police station. The injured Zheng was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. During the interrogation, Zhao confessed that the attack was carried out by Sun Zhilan (from Xiaogaoyou, residing at No. 32, Jingyi Lane, Malang Road) and Huang Zhangda (from Wuxi, residing at No. 44, Songshan Road). The detectives then arrested Sun and Huang. They further confessed that Li Xiaoma, Xiaochangjiao, and Erheitan, who are still at large, were also involved in the assault. The victim denied their involvement in the assault. The next day, the police transferred Zhao, Sun, and Huang to the Special First Court for interrogation and investigation. Details of the case have been reported in this newspaper. The day before yesterday morning, Chen Pusheng from the Special Second Court of Shanghai presided over the continued interrogation in the Eighth Criminal Court. Yao Zhaodi, a lawyer from the Police Department, presented the case and prosecuted them for the crime of injury. Zheng Baolin, the victim, then testified about the incident and claimed that he saw Zhao Changrong standing opposite him and directing the attack. Zhao denied the accusation and hired lawyer Li Ming to defend him, presenting evidence to prove that the defendant did not participate in or instigate the assault on the plaintiff. Sun and Huang continued to testify as before. The court announced the conclusion of the interrogation and awaited a scheduled sentencing. Zhao was released on a 200 yuan shop guarantee, while the others were remanded in custody.</p>

Due to the drought in Yixing last year, Wang Cao brought her daughter to Shanghai and asked a matchmaker shop on Fuyou Road to recommend Hongmei as a domestic helper. Unexpectedly, within half a year, Hongmei was lured and pawned into a brothel by an unknown person. At first, the madam treated Hongmei well because of her youth and beauty. However, after a few months, if Hongmei failed to receive customers every night, she would be whipped. Hongmei lamented her fate and repeatedly tried to escape, but was closely guarded and could not find an opportunity. Yesterday afternoon at 4:20, Hongmei seized an opportunity to escape to the city. Unexpectedly, her mother, Wang Cao, who was urgently seeking her daughter because Hongmei had been betrothed to a man named Chen from the same village, happened to meet her on the road. Wang Cao wanted to take her daughter back to the village, but Hongmei refused to marry the man named Chen. Despite all persuasion, she remained unwilling. The police were then called to the Yimiao Police Station for investigation.

<p>Gu Hongsheng, a 30-year-old man from Liuhe, had been working at the Yongyi Rice Shop on Sanyang Road in Zhabei. Recently, he was dismissed by the shop manager due to negligence. Gu became distraught and conceived the idea of ending his life. On the 24th, at 2 p.m., he went alone to the Southeast Hotel at No. 11 opposite Ruifu Lane, West Zilaihuo Street, French Concession, and registered as Gu Hongnan, renting room 46 upstairs. That night, he went out and bought raw opium to commit suicide. He had previously sent a letter to his younger brother, Gu Sanbao (23 years old, working at the Yongji Rice Shop at No. 542, Kangnao Tuo Road, Public Concession), asking to borrow some pocket money and instructing him to deliver it to the Southeast Hotel. The next day at noon, his brother brought several silver dollars to the Southeast Hotel to visit him. The tea boy, Zhou Zhiren (36 years old, from Haimen), led him upstairs and knocked on the door of room 46, calling out for a long time without response. They then found a way to open the door and entered the room. Gu was lying supine on the bed, his face pale and ashen, saliva foaming from his mouth, unable to speak, barely alive, and in critical condition. Realizing that he had taken poison, his brother immediately hired a rickshaw to take him to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, the opium poison had spread deeply in his abdomen, and the medical treatment was ineffective. He died at 5:30 p.m. on the 26th. The hospital reported to the police station, which sent detectives to investigate. Gu's body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for an autopsy. His brother was notified. As yesterday was the birthday of Confucius, the Supreme Sage and Teacher, it was a holiday. The report will be submitted to the Special Second Court today for officials to examine.</p>

He immediately ran to the police station on the road to report the incident. Police chief Qian Yufeng rushed to the scene and took Zhou to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. He then reported to the Caojiadu Branch Bureau, and detectives Zhuang Dexiu and Wang Yixin joined the search for the assailant but found no trace.

Nearby, Shen Jigeng, a 21-year-old local man who is a blacksmith, is fond of womanizing. Seeing that the girl was young and easily deceived, he constantly stalked and teased her, eventually bewitching her. On the 23rd of this month, at about 3 a.m., he lured her to room number 8 of the Dalu Hotel at No. 12, Gongyu Lane, Huade Road, and defiled her chastity, staying for several nights. Wang Shifu, the girl's father, reported the incident to the Yulin Road Police Station. Detective Jin Wanrong, at about 6 a.m. the next morning, discovered the location where they were hiding and, together with Wang, secretly went to the address and arrested Shen Jigeng in the room, bringing him and Wang together to the police station. Shen was taken into custody, and Wang Genda was sent to the hospital. After examination by the doctor, it was found that her private parts were injured and infected with gonorrhea. The next morning, Shen was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the Special First Court. Wang Yaotang, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, detailed the case and filed a public prosecution based on Article 240, the third offence of harming marriage and family. Wang Shifu and Wang Genda testified about the incident, stating that the girl was not yet married. When questioned, the defendant claimed that Wang was willing and that he did not abduct her, asking for leniency. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered him to remain in custody for further review. The girl was examined by a forensic doctor to confirm.</p>

<p>On Fangshelu, from in front of the Chen Yingshi Memorial Tower to Xiejiao Bridge, the Municipal Public Utility Bureau has a power transmission line for trams and three red and green light lines for tram crossings, all of which are bare wires, belonging to the French Tram and Electricity Company. The installation location is above and below the city street light poles. Moreover, because the line has not been repaired for a long time, many sections are loose and sagging, and many places are touching or resting on the street light frames and street light fire wires, which is very dangerous for street light workers. The bureau has now sent a letter to the French Tram and Electricity Company asking it to improve the wiring in that area as soon as possible to avoid danger.</p>

<p>Lion Brand Panacea Loses Lawsuit The Tiger Balm balm is effective in treating diseases and is widely popular, so there are many counterfeiters seeking profit. Guo Dongliang of Shantou Ren'antang once produced a type of Lion Brand Panacea, whose trademark and packaging were completely similar to that of Yong'antang Tiger Balm. Yong'antang legally sued them in court and filed a trademark administrative lawsuit. After many years of mutual litigation, the Executive Yuan finally ruled that the plaintiff's (i.e., Guo Dongliang's) lawsuit was dismissed and Yong'antang won the final lawsuit. The case had previously been ruled by the Executive Yuan that Ren'antang Guo Dongliang's Lion Brand and packaging did indeed imitate Yong'antang Tiger Balm, and the trademark was completely revoked. Ren'antang refused to accept this and appealed to the Administrative Court, which also ruled that the plaintiff's lawsuit was dismissed.</p>

<h3 id="e168">Letter to the Editor <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Dear Editor, I recently read the section "Clash Between New and Old Workers at North Station" in your newspaper, and I found that it deviates slightly from the facts. I would like to present the details of the incident as follows, and wish you well. Zhu San was ordered by the Railway Bureau on the 23rd of this month to take over the loading and unloading work at the North Freight Station on August 24th and be responsible for the rectification. To prevent disturbances, Zhu San did not change any of the original workers. The treatment was in complete compliance with the regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Railways. Zhu San repeatedly announced this to the workers upon arriving at the station. The workers agreed to the takeover at the time but put forward four conditions that had to be reported to the director of the Traffic Department on the 26th before they would agree to comply. Zhu San accepted this. Therefore, there were no accidents on the 24th and 25th. On the morning of the 26th, after reporting to the director of the Traffic Department, Zhu San went to the station. The station master of the freight station, Qi, summoned the worker representatives Wei Yuemeng and Hong Yun for a discussion. Unexpectedly, a martial drama suddenly broke out outside the station before they had said a few words. Fearing that it would affect the writing room, Qi closed all the doors, and Zhu San and others were spared from the disaster. It was found that Zhu San only brought eleven people to the station and did not bring a single extra person. Outside rumors that Zhu led more than a hundred new workers to the station to take over were completely untrue. This was witnessed not only by the station master of the freight station, Qi, the section chief of the police, Zhong, and the team leader of the security office, Xue, but also by the worker representatives Zhang Yuemeng and Hong Yun. As for how the beating occurred, whether it was instigated by Zhu San, and whether Zhu San was involved, the Public Security Bureau has sent the relevant people to the court. In the future, who is right and who is wrong will naturally come to light. In short, Zhu San was ordered to rectify and acted in accordance with the bureau's order. If the workers objected, they could report to the Railway Bureau. How could they lead new workers to forcibly seize the food and clothing of the original workers? Moreover, the contracting of this work is not a contracting system, and the benefits are absolutely open. Most of the workers have already understood the content. The workers who oppose it are actually a minority. Moreover, it has been found that these minority workers do not work for nothing on weekdays, which has led to repeated disputes in the past. Without their instigation, not only would this unfortunate incident not have occurred, but there would have been no need for Zhu San to rectify it. In addition to reporting the situation to the Railway Bureau for instructions, please publish this letter in the Letter to the Editor column to avoid untrue rumors. I am deeply grateful. Yours sincerely, Sun Zhu San, Contractor for Loading and Unloading Work at the North Freight Station of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, Address: No. 17, Lane 6, Ningkang Lane, North Zhejiang Road.</p>
<p>To the Editor: The news item published in today's news column about the clash between new and old workers at the North Station is not consistent with the facts. Our cooperative has more than 130 loading and unloading workers who have served the Railway Bureau for nearly 20 years and have done their best. The person in charge of the cooperative, Mr. Gao Ge, has also worked in the Railway Bureau for more than ten years. In the 17th year of the Republic of China, he was promoted to worker leader and was especially valued by the directors of the Railway Bureau. As a custom, if the work is busy, our cooperative hires temporary workers to help. These workers are led by Liu Chaojin. In recent years, business has been slow, and our cooperative has been unable to give the temporary workers work from time to time. Liu Chaojin has always wanted to seize the duties of our cooperative, so he is cooperating with Sun Zhu San. Sun's son, Lü Ping, claims to be a secretary somewhere and is said to be the most trusted confidant of the director. With this help, Liu has become even more rampant and unscrupulous. On the 1st of this month, he led six or seventy temporary workers to our cooperative to beat us up. He then reported the incident to the police station. Suddenly, a detective sent by the garrison headquarters came and arrested our Gao Ge and Cui Shita, and they have been detained until now. Now Sun, together with Liu and Secretary Zhao from somewhere, led more than 200 temporary workers, each armed with pistols and knives, to the two-road station early yesterday morning to forcibly seize the work, which led to the fight. This was entirely caused by Liu, Sun, Zhao, and others. It is not that our Gao Ge has no control. All the details will be reported by our cooperative to the Central Party Headquarters and the local officials, as well as the two road directors, to seek a fair judgment. The truth will soon come to light. This is the truth, and we earnestly request your editor-in-chief to correct this and publish it in the "Letter to the Editor" column. Respectfully yours, Shanghai North Station Freight Cooperative, August 27th.</p>

<h3 id="e176">Mr. Hu Puan's Opinion on Separate Schools for Boys and Girls: Male and Female Temperaments are Different, and Training and Education Naturally Differ Slightly; Local Customs are Different, so it is Advisable to Adapt to Local Conditions <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Since the Beiping Municipal Government advocated separate schools for boys and girls, it has attracted the attention of people in the education circles in various places. Yesterday, a reporter from the Shanghai News Agency specially visited Mr. Hu Puan, a famous scholar of Chinese culture, to inquire about his opinion on separate schools for boys and girls. He was pleased to express his views as follows: Mr. Hu said that boys and girls must have the same knowledge, which is the educational principle of the modern world. Coeducation in our country has been implemented for a short time after the state's formulation. Recently, some provinces and cities have advocated the system of separate schools, which has not been approved by the central government, causing repercussions in schools. The reform of the education system is a major matter, and it is necessary to gather the cooperative spirit of all three parties, consider its advantages and disadvantages, and make a plan for prompt agreement. It should not be implemented in a [hasty] manner.</p>
<p>Discussion Among Celebrities</p>
<p>Now that there is freedom of speech, all celebrities who have deeply studied the boy-girl school system can publish their opinions in newspapers and magazines for the authorities to adopt. Because boys and girls have different temperaments, there are slight differences in the two key points of teaching and training. Their main courses can be studied together, and some subjects such as home economics, even in the same school, should be set up in separate elective classrooms for girls for separate teaching. In addition, girls are physically weaker, and their physical education should also pay attention to separate practice. This is a discussion of coeducation and separate education in terms of principles, but it is necessary to carefully examine the academic atmosphere of each place and each school, and to measure the advantages and disadvantages of teaching and training to determine which standard is more suitable for the coeducation system or the separate education system as a basis for choice.</p>
<p>Proposals from Provinces and Cities</p>
<p>Provincial and municipal departments and bureaus are closer to local situations and should often inspect the schools under their jurisdiction at ordinary times to understand the actual situation in detail. They should also widely collect opinions from celebrities and public opinion for reference. If there is a closed atmosphere in the area under their jurisdiction, such as in northern China, where many old families adhere to old habits and would rather girls lose their education if there are no girls' schools, then it may be permissible to make a proposal to the department for approval to establish girls' schools on a case-by-case basis. The key is to ensure that girls receive a corresponding education within the possible scope. If there are no special circumstances, the old system can be maintained.</p>
<p>National Formulation</p>
<p>Our country has difficult finances and shallow public knowledge. Coeducation for boys and girls is particularly economical. If a separate system is implemented, funding will be stretched, and there may be only a few or no girls' schools in various places, so girls will have few opportunities to attend school. Because coeducation for boys and girls is prone to abuses, the advantages and disadvantages should be weighed, and the emphasis should be placed on avoiding the serious and choosing the light to establish a system. Then the central government can have a general overview of the country's politics and education, and can adopt the trends of the opinions of famous people across the country, and submit the cases presented by various provinces and cities to the staff of the ministries and departments for special research and discussion. It is necessary to carefully consider the actual situation in various places and either continue to use the coeducation system, or change to the separate education system, or use a combination of the coeducation and separate education systems, taking the consensus of the majority, passing it at a meeting, and writing it into the regulations. It must be implemented nationwide to achieve the effect of unifying politics and education.</p>

<p>In order to promote cooperation between inventors and investors and to truly encourage the interest of Chinese people in researching science, the Zhejiang Provincial People's Education Hall has specially requested inventors across the country to select and send their products to hold a large-scale exhibition of new inventions by Chinese people on a scheduled basis. The Yu's Chinese typewriter, which was awarded Patent Certificate No. 18 by the Ministry of Industry, is related to culture. However, it has been found that senior government agencies and national postal banks almost never use it. Moreover, the structure of the machine is robust, the movement is sensitive, and it can type 20 to 30 words per minute. With carbon paper, it can type 16 to 17 copies at a time. It can also be typed on wax paper and printed with a mimeograph machine, printing hundreds or thousands of copies like a single sheet. The characters are made of steel with the hardness of copper, which greatly benefits culture. The hall believes that it is necessary to have a public exhibition and has sent a letter to Yu Binqi Chinese Typewriter Manufacturing Factory at No. 62 Zhoujia Zui Road, Shanghai, to contact them and has obtained Mr. Yu's consent to participate in the public exhibition. It is heard that other products are also being solicited, and the hall warmly welcomes all participants.</p>

<p>Professor Xia Chengfeng (Zi Zhan Chu) of the College of Education of National Central University and former inspector of Jiangsu Province, was one of the famous professors of National Central University. He had been a professor at the school for seven years. His books, such as "Local Educational Administration" and "Education," were popular for a time and were widely circulated in domestic education circles. This time, he was invited by Hubei Province to give a lecture in Wuhan. After returning to Nanjing, he felt slightly unwell. At first, he did not pay attention, but unexpectedly, he contracted typhoid fever, and his condition became increasingly critical. He passed away on the evening of the 23rd (two days ago) at the age of only 37, leaving behind five children, the oldest of whom is only 14 years old, and parents in their 70s. The whole family usually relied solely on Mr. Xia's salary to make a living. He left nothing behind after his death, which is truly regrettable. Fortunately, he had a life insurance policy with China United Assurance Company last year through the introduction of his classmate Qian Zhisheng, but the amount is not large and is only a drop in the bucket, only enough to cover a portion of his children's education expenses. It is heard that colleagues from the College of Education of National Central University will hold a memorial service in Nanjing.</p>

<p>As Ned listened to these words, his face gradually brightened. Although his report card was not long, it had given him a great deal of spiritual encouragement, making him feel that he also had some qualifications and was not completely useless. "Yes, I can control my temper—I learned that from my father's cane; I can play the violin, although I don't know where the Tannu Tuva Sea is," he thought to himself, and there was a kind of indescribable comfort in his heart. Then he began to speak, so eagerly that Little Bridge heard him. He said:</p>
<p>"I really want to learn, I'm determined to do it. I never go to school, but it's not my fault; if they don't laugh at me, I guess I'll be able to do very well—you and the headmaster treat me so well."</p>
<p>Little Bridge forgot everything and shouted, "They're not allowed to laugh at you; if they laugh, I—I—I'll tell them they can't."</p>
<p>Everyone stopped their nine-by-nine-eighty-one work, and everyone looked up to see what was going on.</p>
<p>Mr. Pei felt that the lesson of mutual assistance was more important than arithmetic at this time, so he told them about Ned's situation, and told the story in an interesting and moving way. Therefore, these kind-hearted children agreed to give him a hand and felt honored to have been asked to share their knowledge with a talented person. This public request planted good feelings in them and reduced Ned's obstacles, because everyone was happy to give him all kinds of "tips" to help him gradually ascend the ladder of learning.</p>

<p>Today, the Standard Yarn and Cotton Market is closed for Confucius' birthday. However, spot yarn merchants are still gathering at the market, but demand from buyers is still scarce. Only 207 bales were traded, and the market was similar to the previous day. However, overseas cotton news is better. U.S. cotton futures rose slightly by 3 to 8 pounds, Indian cotton rose by 1.75 to 2.25 rupees, Osaka's three-brand yarn rose by 3 yuan, and three-brand cotton rose by about 1 yuan. Regarding the situation of Osaka yarn and cotton, the decline has been more acute in the past two days. After a big drop, there should be this rebound.

<p>As of August 25th, the cotton stock in Tianjin totaled 45,438 bales, including 16,242 bales of coarse cotton and 29,196 bales of fine cotton. This is a decrease of 5,453 bales compared to August 15th, including a decrease of 1,003 bales of coarse cotton and a decrease of 3,450 bales of fine cotton.</p>
<p>The Xihe cotton market is generally sluggish. Only Shanghai yarn factories slightly increased their appetite. Purchases by Western and Eastern merchants are not smooth, and the market is very depressed. Tongfuhang bought 200 bales, and Huaxin Textile Factory bought 250 bales. The asking price was 37.5 yuan for both.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Concerns Over Loan Issues May Cause Changes; American Cotton Speculators Are Cautious <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened with prices rising by 8 to 11 points for each month. There is even a possibility that the Senate's efforts to loan one angle two fen may succeed, which caused the loan issue to become a stalemate and has not yet been resolved. The movement and arbitrage of goods in the interior have slowed down. Speculators are cautiously awaiting the results of political developments. Therefore, sellers are refraining from taking action, and the market price is firm. Then, a part of the bulls closed out, and it softened again. The closing was stable. The spot price remained unchanged, and futures rose by 3 to 10 points. British cotton spot rose by one point, and futures fell by 2 to 4 points. Indian cotton was firm at first because European exporters bought in, then it fell back due to bull liquidation and futures traders selling. Finally, it was firm again as European exporters bought in. For example, Phulgao rose 2.15 rupees, Oomra rose 1.75 rupees, and Broach rose 2 rupees. The original telegram recorded to the left (August 26th telegram):</p>
<p>Phulgao 19.50 rise 2.25 18.60</p>
<p>Oomra 113.25 1.75 25.60</p>
<p>Broach 194.25 2.00 28.30</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, each origin area supply was still only 10 or so merchants (totaling over 2,000 piculs). The market situation was that sales were flat in this street, with Paohang Island Merchants only buying 400 or so bags. However, due to the reduced supply, the market atmosphere was tight. As a result, the market trends for each thick japonica and thin indica were neither good nor bad. The situation for Doo Young pointed rice was also stable, while the market trend of each new japonica was slightly soft due to the increasing availability of new crops. The price was softer by a few cents. Yesterday, Minhang new japonica rice also entered the market. The goods were transported by Li Zhenxing Company to Shanghai and sold after being milled white at the Xinchang factory. The quality of the rice was quite good, with an opening price of 8 and a half yuan.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 17 or 18 boats arrived from the downstream rivers. The sales of white japonica rice, early thin indica, East New japonica, etc. in the market were weak and slack, and the market price was tired and a little less by a dime. The sales of white yuan were balanced, and the price situation was stable. New customer pointed car transport rice has a small sales market, and the market situation is stable. The other types of goods also appear fatigued and soft.</p>

<p>In the overseas wheat market, there were few followers when prices rose, and the bulls were very disappointed. The big price increase is still awaiting the entry of the public. Last week, the available supply increased by 5,356,000 bushels.</p>

<p>The new longans of this year, such as those from Xinghua, Quanzhou, Guangdong, Tongan, and Anhai, have all reported poor harvests. However, more is produced in Shima, Tongzhou. Due to the poor harvests in other places, the price is also not willing to be too low. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's Taiyuan wheel, from Xiamen imported, the first batch of new Shima Longan has been transported to the market. Because of the Confucius' birthday holiday closure, the total number is unknown. Based on the known numbers of each company, the total is about 200 boxes. There are also 5 or 6 boxes of sun-dried longan pulp from Xinma. The samples are expected to be available for pricing in the next few days.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Silk and Tea: Precious Eyebrow Green Tea Sales to France Slightly Active <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Shanghai foreign firms' tea market, sales of precious eyebrow green tea from Wuyuan and Tunxi regions to France showed slight activity. Yongxing, Fushi, Huacha, Tianxiang, and other firms have been actively processing orders due to responses received from Morocco to telegrams sent last week. Total city transactions amounted to over 300 cases, with top-grade tea selling at 115 yuan per package and ordinary tea at 78 yuan, showing little change in price compared to before. In addition, Gongxi tea was also being processed by firms such as Baitou, Zhuang Meixing, and Daosheng. However, the inventory of green tea from various regions remains abundant, and Russian firms have not yet commenced operations. Supply exceeds demand, making it difficult to view the situation as optimistic.</p>

<p>The Hanpu white tung oil market has seen rapid progress recently. At the beginning of last week, each dan (unit of weight) was still only 49 yuan, but it continued to increase, reaching 51 yuan by the weekend. Just a month ago, people believed that 50 yuan was inevitable, but it suddenly surged above 50 yuan. Foreign firms' demand remains strong, and sufficient quality goods are scarce. Foreign firms in Shuibu have also been procuring recently, with the highest price reaching 53 yuan per dan, though in small quantities. However, given the current shortage, it represents the formal market price. Recently, Hangzhou merchants in Shanghai have been offering high-quality oil at 50 yuan per dan, while lower-quality oil requires 45-46 yuan. Supplies are limited, so there is concern about a potential interruption before the new harvest.</p>

<p>Yesterday, a wide range of woolens were available. Transactions in goods from Japanese and Polish merchants were particularly brisk. Yuan Chang bibi, Zhigong flannel, Hailing peng, suit woolens, Melton, and plain heavy woolens all saw substantial sales. Most transactions were based on invoices, with delivery scheduled in two weeks. Examples include Ruiwen, Huabo, and Shili Luo's 3 yuan plain heavy woolens, and Japanese 559 yuan Zhigong flannel. Local merchants were involved in these transactions. The transaction price for 559 Zhigong was 3.9 yuan per yard, Ruiwen's 1300 plain heavy woolens sold for 2.95 yuan, Huabo Yuanchang camel Hailing peng sold for 4.75 yuan, and Shili Luo Melton sold for 1.65 yuan.</p>

<p>Due to the construction sector's frantic activity, over a hundred tons of ribbed steel bars were sold. The market price opened at 97 yuan, more than 2 yuan higher than before, due to low inventory. However, due to the continuous contraction of foreign exchange rates and the high cost of imported goods, the future market price is expected to continue to be favorable.</p>

<p>To be a great figure in modern times, the first thing is to train your body to be like a rattan cane - somewhat flexible, yet very strong; able to bend, yet never break; able to bow under slight pressure, yet returning to its normal uprightness and lofty spirit once the pressure is gone.</p>

In terms of overall evolution, failure is a low point in the long journey of evolution, a completely natural phenomenon. To be discouraged by this and lack the courage to persevere is pointless self-affliction.</p>
<p>The most pitiable people in the world are those who are indecisive, hesitant, and lost when faced with problems, unsure of which path to take. They are those who cannot make their own choices and only listen to others. Such people cannot gain the trust of others.</p>

<p>— Lan Shan</p>
<p>Wearing a red gold engagement ring on the ring finger of my left hand, the heart that has been fluttering for a long time is now settling down. Although it is said to be settling down, there is still a kind of floating feeling. Thinking of the happy days to come, a burst of frivolous fluctuations arises in my heart, and a shallow smile unconsciously hangs on my face.</p>
<p>This is originally happiness. After wearing this ring, there is a girl in the world who belongs to you, and you yourself also belong to that girl.</p>
<p>Think about the past. When she had not agreed to your marriage, how uneasy were you? Afraid that she would be snatched away by others, afraid that her name could not be printed out in lead letters in the newspaper alongside yours, announcing your success. But now she is yours, and your worries can come to an end.</p>
<p>If she is pursued by several men at the same time, and the result is still that you capture her, then you are the victor in this love war. The glory on your face can truly shine with the gold ring on your finger, with extra prestige and spirit.</p>
<p>During leisure time, you can hold her arm and stroll around the busiest streets for a couple of laps, letting those single young men and women look at you, causing their irrelevant jealousy or envious "attention."</p>
<p>The most precious time in life is during the engagement. Once you get married, your good dreams gradually fade. The future life you imagined during your engagement is beautiful, sweet, and full of poetry. How considerate, gentle, affectionate, and comforting you will be to each other. But after marriage, how many loving couples are there in the world? You must try your best to enjoy your engagement life, and after getting engaged, don't rush to get married. This is my hope for those young men and women who are already engaged, but whether you listen or not is up to you. (My meaning is that such good dreams should be prolonged a little. You are eager to get married, only wanting to destroy this good dream.)</p>
<p>Because I myself have recently become engaged, I have many feelings in my heart, and I am also afraid that I am eager to destroy this good dream, so I wrote this article in a rambling way, to warn myself and to tell many people who wear engagement rings.</p>
<p>Let us stay in this good dream for a few more years!</p>
<h3 id="e207">The Singing of Autumn Insects <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>There are the most kinds of autumn insects. The ancients said, "Autumn is heralded by the singing of insects." This saying is indeed correct. Look, even before the weather has turned to autumn, the "Geges" (katydids) appear. People who make a living from this carry a load on their shoulders and stop on the streets, relying on these small insects to eat. It is said that they are all transported from the Zhenjiang area. If they are produced in Shandong, then their singing will be even louder! Actually, what is so good about this kind of singing? Moreover, the hotter the weather, the louder their sound. Alas! People who like to raise them not only do not find them annoying but say that listening to them can relieve the summer heat. I really don't understand.</p>
<p>Now that autumn has arrived, if you sit in front of the steps on a cool evening, hearing the sounds of the "Weaving Maid" and "Silk Reeler" (two kinds of insects, commonly known by these names in Jiading), you can be reminded of the principle that "if one woman does not weave, she may suffer from the cold," because their singing sounds very much like reeling silk and weaving cloth. It is a pity that the handicrafts in today's rural areas are truly not as diligent as they are! As for other insects like the "Bell" (divided into two types: heavenly bell and earthly bell, one being green and the other gray) and the "Jasmine Seed," those who are particular about it even use glass to glue together extremely ingenious boxes to keep them in. The heavenly bell is originally yin in nature, and when night falls, it becomes very active, flapping its wings and rubbing them together to make a sound. This sound is indeed clear and pleasant to listen to. Although the jasmine seed is small, when placed on the table, if you are flipping through books and reciting, its sound feels particularly quiet, and it constantly helps you with your pure enjoyment. Therefore, it is not right to say that autumn insects are completely without merit.</p>
<p>However, like crickets (which we in Jiading call "Zanji"), they are also autumn insects. You say they are different in nature? Hey! According to zoologists, all those who can produce beautiful sounds are male. They do so to pursue females and want to reproduce. There is no reason for people to raise them. Unexpectedly, people will use them as gambling tools. People move them left and right with a straw, and the winner crows triumphantly, while the loser is like falling flowers and flowing water, silent. It is really a sight to see. In fact, the cricket itself does not know that it is being fooled, which is most pitiful. Alas! It is not only autumn insects that are like this. I see that there are many people in the world who are doing this kind of dreaming!</p>

<p>Our dear compatriots, people say they don't know how to love their country. As I see it, this is a real injustice. There are facts to prove it:</p>
<p>I don't remember which day it was, but I took a tram to Hongkou. Several people got on halfway. The ticket seller asked them where they were going. One of them said: "Just the X station ahead, not far from here. This money is for you to enjoy." As he spoke, he held a large bag of copper coins in his hand, waved it in front of the ticket seller, and said: "We are all Chinese, everyone has to help each other." The ticket seller smiled and walked away.</p>
<p>Looking at it this way, who says we Chinese don't love our country?</p>

<p>Disinfecting Green Vegetables: The various green vegetables that we eat every day are often carriers of digestive infectious diseases because the cultivation of vegetables involves irrigating with human waste fertilizer, so the leaves and roots of the vegetables are attached with many infectious bacteria. In rural farmhouses, after cutting the vegetables, they are casually washed in streams or ponds and then brought to the cities to be sold. If they are washed and boiled before cooking, there is less danger. However, there are several kinds of vegetables that are eaten raw or are not completely boiled, so the infectious bacteria attached to the vegetable leaves can be very harmful. If we want to be safe, it is best to disinfect the green vegetables. The method of disinfection is to use bleaching powder (i.e., chloral lime). Bleaching powder is white, has a saltpetre smell, and turns red when dissolved in water. The effective ingredient of this powder only exerts its disinfecting power when 20-25% is decomposed in water. Because the disinfecting substance produced by decomposition is easily acidified (e.g., by organic matter and alkaline substances), it is still necessary to wash with clean water after washing with bleaching powder water, so that organic matter can be eliminated and the smell of bleaching powder can be washed away.</p>
<p>Simple Laundry Methods: Washing clothes differs depending on the material. The clothes worn in summer are mostly white silk crepe. Laundry shops use bleaching and steaming to wash silk clothes, but this is very inconvenient in ordinary households. Now there is a very simple method: use a basin of warm water, dissolve two scoops of washing soda, and soak the clothes thoroughly. Then, dirty things will easily fall off. After one or two hours, gently rub with your hands, take them out and wring them dry. Then, soak washing soap powder in boiling water, soak the clothes for an hour, take them out and slowly brush away stains with a scrubbing brush. If there are yellow stains, then bleaching should be used, which is to dissolve one scoop of bleaching powder in two quarts of cold water and soak the stained part. Stains will easily fall off. If the whole piece of silk is yellow, such as spun silk, which turns yellow after being worn for a long time, then two quarts of cold water, two scoops of bleaching powder, and one scoop of heavy alkali should be mixed and dissolved for soaking. However, cloth clothes should not be bleached. For Indian silk and thin silk crepe, one scoop of heavy alkali and one scoop of high-quality washing soap powder can be used. After washing, add one scoop of the vitriol, twenty drops of acetic acid, and one quart of water for washing. Then use two scoops of Hydrosalfit powder, five or six drops of acetic acid, and two quarts of boiling water to soak. When the material is pure white, take it out and rinse with clean water.</p>
<p>White Leather Shoe Refreshing Method: For leather shoes with white enamel on the leather surface, apply water oil first when buying them to prevent wrinkles and make the leather soft. After three or four days, wipe with vinegar. However, colored leather shoes will change color if wiped with vinegar. If there is dirty stuff stuck on the shoe surface, you can wipe it off with gasoline first. However, the most important thing to pay attention to when wearing white leather shoes is that if there is a stain, it should be cleaned up as soon as possible and should not be left for too long. If there is mud, brush off the mud first with a shoe brush, or rub with a rubber eraser, then wash with soapy water, apply white powder, and wait until it is dry before brushing all over with a hard-bristled shoe brush. The surface of ordinary white leather shoes is mostly made of white sheepskin, white deerskin, or white chamois skin, so it is easier to wash and scrub if they are not too dirty.</p>

<p>Zhang Jiefu put away his worried look, forced a smile, and said, "Actually, even if Commissioner Lan doesn't come, my matter can also be published." Li Shilian smiled and said, "Wouldn't it be different after all? In official circles, there is a matter of power and a matter of benefit. If you can get a big hat to wear, then you can suppress people very well." Jiefu smiled and said, "I wouldn't dare say I can wear a big hat. However, the secretary-general of the commissioner is my close relative, and he can't help but give me a little help." As he spoke, the errand runner who delivered the letter returned. Jiefu went forward to meet him and asked, "Did you send my letter to the secretary-general?" The errand runner said, "I sent it." He replied with three words in a flat tone. Jiefu smiled at Shilian and shook his head a few times, making a proud appearance, and said, "Relatives in the hometown seem nothing special, but when they arrive in a foreign land, they are very affectionate." Errand runner, after he smiled, what else did he say? The errand runner looked at Jiefu and smiled, but refused to say. Jiefu said, "Why don't you say it?" The errand runner thought that he had given him twenty copper coins, so he smiled and said, "He said his wife's surname is not Zhang." After speaking, the errand runner turned and left. Jiefu's face flushed for a moment, but he immediately calmed down and smiled, "This errand runner knows one thing but not the other. Mr. Qiu's wife is my aunt's daughter. We brothers treat this cousin as our sister. Originally, an aunt is the same as an uncle, and a cousin is no different from a biological sister, so I call Mr. Qiu my brother-in-law. This is not forced." (301)</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>When the eunuch returned to the palace, my father asked him to bring me a secret letter, which roughly said:</p>
<p>"Since you have already agreed to the Empress Dowager, of course, I can't help but let you do it this time! But I must warn you that from now on, in the palace, you must keep two points firmly in mind: first, do not talk too much; second, do not boast of your abilities in front of people, thinking that you know more about everything than others, especially not in front of the Empress Dowager. Otherwise, I will really worry about you! I never expected that you remembered those French hair dyes so clearly. Wouldn't it be better if you had forgotten them earlier? If those medicines are sent and tried, and unfortunately damage the Empress Dowager's hair, I am afraid that the death penalty will undoubtedly be added to you! At that time, I will not have any power to save you, and I can only blame yourself for bringing it on!"</p>
<p>What my father said was of course good words, but in my mind at that time, my father was indeed too old-fashioned, daring not be careless about anything. I myself did not worry about anything and was very confident that my head would definitely not be cut off by the Empress Dowager because I firmly believed that those French hair dyes would definitely not be without effect. But after a long time, my experience increased, and I gradually realized that this kind of action was indeed like playing with fire and would cause a disaster if I were not careful.</p>
<p>More than forty days later, the Parisian hair dyes arrived as scheduled. As soon as I received them, I couldn't wait to hold those colorful boxes and send them to the Empress Dowager, and in front of her, I opened the boxes and took out a few bottles of medicine. At the same time, I said to her:</p>
<p>"There is also a very detailed instruction manual here! It teaches us how to use it, so we have to be careful to follow it..." (401)</p>

<h3 id="e213">The Rise of Literary Contingency (Tokyo Correspondence) <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Hongying</p>
<p>Recently, in the Japanese literary world, there has been a widespread debate on "contingency." The reason for this debate is due to two main facts: first, the issue of the so-called "purity" or "popularity" of literature, that is, to make literature not lose its "purity" as literature, not fall into the path of boring "popular literature," but also be rich in popular interest; second, the issue of romanticism, that is, in view of the mechanical and dull dryness of realism, the active expression is required. (This has been supported by some people led by Kataoka Teppei, forming the "Social Romantic School.") These two issues have a common point, that is, they both want to "make it interesting." When discussing this "interestingization," the focus of the problem shifted to "contingency."</p>
<p>Almost every active critic and writer has been drawn into the vortex of this "contingency theory" debate. Although the object of the problem is in literature, the scope involved includes philosophy, physics, statistics, and so on. Although the opinions of each person in the debate vary, they can be summarized into two major categories in essence, and each major category can be further divided into smaller categories.</p>
<p>The first category is represented by the views of Yokomitsu Riichi, Nakagami Yoichi, Ishiwara Jun, and Kataoka Teppei. The second category is represented by Moriyama Kei, Ogiwara Naka, and some of Tosaka Jun's views, which inherit the theoretical system of Kurahara Korehito and Kawaguchi Hiroshi.</p>
<p>Yokomitsu Riichi believes that the current Japanese popular literature has two elements: one is appealing to sentimentality, and the other is utilizing contingency. He advocates that pure popular literature in the future should abandon the former element—sentimentality, and adopt the latter—contingency. He said: "The contingency (temporality or specificity) in pure novels, or the deformed part of the special movement that naturally occurs due to the concentration of the daily life (necessity or universality) that constitutes most of that novel: or it intensifies the previous daily life, making that contingency possible to occur, making that contingency occur. If contingency appears in the work without one of these two, then the contingency expressed will definitely become sentimental." Yokomitsu Riichi is a so-called liberal literary person, so his views are quite sharp. He thoroughly explained a part of the essential relationship between contingency and necessity here. However, he only believes that contingency is the concentration of necessity, and he does not know that necessity is the concentration of contingency. He recognizes necessity as a kind of daily life and denies that necessity can become another possibility of higher expression.</p>
<p>Nakagami Yoichi's theory of contingency is concretely advocated in his "Theory of Contingent Literature" in the June issue of "Shincho." Although this thing is only a few short pages, it has cited fourteen or five famous scholars from physics, philosophy, and literature, and he has fallen into the quagmire of formal logic. Ishiwara Jun's theory of contingency has a more systematic opinion. He starts from the "epistemology of new quantum mechanics" and its statistical method, all the way to "statistical thinking" (i.e., statistical phenomena in physics and social sciences), and thus establishes his theory of contingency.</p>
<p>"New quantum mechanics" believes that electrons or light are particles and waves at the same time, and it is impossible to accurately determine their position and speed at the same time. Electrons disrupt the original causality of the system being measured, and it is also impossible to measure the position and speed in the purely pure system; therefore, it is impossible to infer the future by the law of causality. Here, "new quantum mechanics" produced the negation of the law of causality. Ishiwara Jun treats the law of causality as necessity, and therefore believes that what cannot be known by this law of causality is contingency. This is the "agnosticism of new quantum mechanics." He also said that thinkers of statistics believe that there is "probability" in the accumulation of this contingency, and they want to drive the concepts of causality and necessity out of the world of learning. Learning is following the "world of probability," and "the world of contingency that cannot be fully covered by this has long belonged outside the scope of science," "We should take this as the theme of literature." Ishiwara Jun has here set up a boundary line of epistemology that cannot be crossed between learning and art, advocating literature with psychology as the theme that cannot be pursued by the law of causality. However, this kind of literature is just "literature of madhouses, confused and crowded futurist literature, and a sentimental rhapsody mixed singing." Ishiwara Jun's claim represents the social consciousness of the few people in modern times who are afraid of the necessity of history.</p>
<p>Kataoka Teppei's theory of contingency is a kind of common sense theory of contingency. The meaning of his contingency is to express "unexpected" and "unpredictable" thoughts. He cited an example: one day he met an old friend - a beautiful woman - in a car, "The novel started from here. If there is this contingency, then any other daily life will have no meaning." This kind of contingency in common sense is completely the existence of subjective concepts, not objective reality.</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about the views of the second category. In 1931, when the international community did not have a clear idea of the issue of contingency, Kurahara Korehito correctly said, "What is not essential to an individual system (or process) is the contingency of that process." For example, the European War was caused by a young Serbian man assassinating the Austrian crown prince. This event was a contingency for the imperialist war. Even without this contingency, the war would have broken out through another contingency.</p>
<p>Kawaguchi Hiroshi further accepted this achievement and said: "Necessary things and contingent things combine to express the surface of phenomena." Necessity is discovered through contingency, and contingency is transformed into necessity.</p>
<p>Moriyama Kei further developed this theory. He pointed out the meaning, duties, and functions of contingency. He pointed out the objectivity of contingency and its role in accelerating or delaying history. Tosaka Jun, Ogiwara Naka, etc. believe that the so-called theory of contingency this time is a "problem of possibility and reality," "the necessary category of realism and even romanticism is not contingency, but the possibility of reality and the freedom of reality." This is quite concise.</p>

<p>— Hu Yifan</p>
<p>The days fly by quickly, and it's almost been two months since I last wrote three articles.</p>
<p>"This is terrible! Time wasted and no results achieved, not to mention I still have to make a living!"</p>
<p>I鞭策 myself in this way three or four times.</p>
<p>I summoned unparalleled courage, sat down at my writing desk, ordered myself to grip the pen holder between my fingers, and shouted from the depths of my heart:</p>
<p>"Write! Write hard! Why aren't you writing?"</p>
<p>I sat blankly at my writing desk with a pen in my hand, time slipping away minute by minute, the manuscript paper on the desk still a blank page. My gloomy brain, as if coated with lime, had blocked every tiny pore.</p>
<p>Turning it over and over, I still couldn't write a single word.</p>
<p>"Heavy and dull! Useless brain!"</p>
<p>All I could do was curse myself again.</p>
<p>The environment now is as calm as can be: the room has never been as peaceful as it is this morning. The children are making not a sound, and my mother is fast asleep in bed, snoring away. Outside, the sounds of even the peddlers are gone. The only commotion is the murmuring of frogs outside the fence, and the birds singing in the short branches of the shrubs in the neighbor's garden; they are here to调剂 this stifling air, could they possibly trigger my literary thoughts! Then, why can't I write?</p>
<p>I took a deep breath, put down my pen, stuck a cigarette between my fingers, and tidied my scattered hair a little. Secretly, I still wanted to鼓舞 my灵思.</p>
<p>"Novel, essay, miscellaneous thoughts, what should I write!"</p>
<p>My thoughts are not organized at all, and I don't know where to start. I switched the cigarette back and forth between my hands, moving up and down around the desk. I lowered my head and stretched, I picked up the pen, and then put it down.</p>
<p>One cigarette was burned, and I quickly lit another. When I really couldn't write a word, I simply played with the smoke rings. Strangely enough, I couldn't even make smoke rings today. Angrily, I slammed the half-smoked cigarette into the spittoon with a *thud*.</p>
<p>I immediately lit another one.</p>
<p>But there was still not a single word on the manuscript paper!</p>
<p>Inspiration is truly not coming today!</p>
<p>I stared blankly at the blank manuscript paper? I frowned, *smack*, and I slammed down the pen again.</p>
<p>"Why do I have to write this damn thing? Can't I do something else? Cursed soulless writing career"</p>
<p>When I hated it, I made up my mind to give up in despair.</p>
<p>"Might as well throw out all that damn stuff on the bookshelf."</p>
<p>But in the blink of an eye, I saw the innocent smiling faces of the children on the small couch beside me, and my mother, leaning up, her eyes revealing dark circles from staying up late writing last night, brought on by excessive fatigue, and I felt a bit of stimulation again.</p>
<p>"I can't be so romantic! Why can't I write?"</p>
<p>I immediately corrected myself and summoned my courage again.</p>
<p>*Tss*, I threw away the half-smoked cigarette again and picked up the pen again.</p>
<p>But what to write? Novel? Essay? Or miscellaneous thoughts? I haven't even thought of a title today! As soon as I touched on this, I became even more disturbed.</p>
<p>I smoked another cigarette, put down the pen, my brain felt as if it were heavily stuffed with lime, not a bit of air通气.</p>
<p>I slowly blurred my past experiences, which, although not rich, were not entirely impoverished, and even wanted to forget them all.</p>
<p>Reality, I am so far away from it.</p>
<p>What to write? I really feel a little sad for myself. A corroded life!</p>

<p>— By S. Yersegev-Yinski, translated by Su Ming</p>
<p>He passed the first week not badly. He used his axe all day long, making firewood while the snow wasn't too deep, to prepare for Changchun's winter. He also smoked some fish, in case the weather was too cold to venture out. He made a shovel to clear the snow from the ice on the river. His axe became his best friend, along with his net and rifle. The fire burned brightly in the cave, and he was so happy that he began to think of the school teacher Yarosha, and sometimes even said aloud: "In a room like this, two people could live well." But he always had to add, "If she didn't have a red head and a black heart."</p>
<p>One morning, when he opened the door (when there was a large amount of積物, the door always opened inward, not outward), he jumped up in alarm. Right in front of the door, hidden under the pine tree, crouched a huge wolf,　 ready to pounce on his throat. Savaka barely managed to slam the door shut. He grabbed his gun. When he opened the door again, *whack*, the wolf was still standing there, a mother wolf, the leader of a pack. He killed her with his first shot, but below, under the pine tree, stood the whole pack of wolves howling. Some of them were retreating to the riverbank, and Savaka noticed that he was surrounded by a large pack of wolves in the forest that night.</p>
<p>He brought the dead wolf's pelt into the cave, but now he only dared go out to catch fish with his rifle. He knew that once wolves discovered a person in the forest, they would never give up. Two days later, in reality, they followed him to the river, and there were no fewer than a dozen of them. Savaka fired twice before they ran away. His cave now had two more wolf pelts. He threw the carcasses on the snow. On the first night, they were吞　 by the rest of the wolf pack, just like the one he had killed before.</p>
<p>Thus began a hunt that lasted a whole winter—a two-sided hunt, the wolves hunting Savaka, and Savaka hunting them. In the winter, he got a total of nine wolf pelts. But he no longer went too far from the cave, and his skis lay unused in the corner. Occasionally, if he was lucky, he would catch a 　鴣 near the cave, and then he could stop catching fish for a while.</p>
<p>Then the days began to be without daylight, only dim. There was no sound in the cave except for the howling of wolves, the occasional啼呌 of big cats, and the roar of frequent blizzards. Savaka carried a notebook with him and wanted to write something. But he wrote so badly, almost like drawing, that he used all the clean paper for cigarettes. Besides, there was really nothing to write about. A cave is finally a cave, winter is like all winters, wolves are just wolves, the forest is just a forest, and the river is no different from other rivers—what else is there to write about?</p>

<p>— Ye Zi</p>
<p>The mother compassionately wrapped the child and brought it to the产妇's side, covering her with a blanket and saying:</p>
<p>"We're almost to Jiujiang, take good care of this child... Congratulations! It's a beautiful little girl!... We'll go and try to think of a solution for you..."</p>
<p>The产妇 seemed to be a little clearer, her sad radish-flower eyes opening, and two lines of tears flowed down in gratitude.</p>
<p>In the统舱 and房舱 (but not going to the官舱), the mother, with the face of a true philanthropist, asked me to hold a plate and, together with her, universally beg alms from the passengers. However, the result was greatly disappointing. Apart from one or two people willing to drop a one or two-角 note, the rest were only some copper coins; counting them, it was neither more nor less than just enough to make up one dollar and three 角.</p>
<p>The mother sighed deeply and said, "How few people do good deeds!" From several layers of paper wrapping, she exchanged her own only extra dollar to make up the sum.</p>
<p>"We're almost to Jiujiang!" The mother walked to the stern again, holding the copper coins, 角 notes, and 洋钱 in her hand, and said to the产妇, "Here are two 元 and more. You can keep it for a little while, and when the purser comes, you can talk to him yourself, give him a little less, and beg him to take you to Wuhu!... Of course," the mother added, "I can also巷 you help say a few words..."</p>
<p>The产妇勉强 struggled to raise half of her body, tears flowing, and tremblingly reached out to take the money, placing it under the blanket. However, the mother suddenly looked at the corner of the blanket that was lifted and called out loudly:</p>
<p>"What! Your child?...”</p>
<p>The woman panicked and fearfully said nothing, letting tears run down her cheeks one after another, heavily falling on the blanket.</p>
<p>"Didn't you throw her away? You heartless woman!"</p>
<p>"I, I, I..." she murmured, sadly lowering her head, and finally could say nothing.</p>
<p>The mother stood for a long, long time! Her eyes fixed on the river bank, fixed on the slowly creeping-over Jiujiang's繫華底 street market, without saying a word. The waves cried and churned under the boat!—Who knows from which bubble was swept away that innocent,　 weak soul...</p>
<p>"Guanyin娘娘啊! My God! A life..."</p>
<p>The tea servers ran over again, this time on the order of the purser, to drive her ashore. The two of them dragged her away without saying a word, one of them rolled up the blanket full of blood 汚 that we gave her.</p>
<p>The boat stopped.</p>
<p>The mother's entire charitable cause had completely failed. When she watched the tea servers drag the产妇 ashore while picking up the scattered copper coins and 洋钱 on the ground, she almost cried. (End)</p>

<p>— Ding</p>
<p>If it is necessary and possible, then please unfold and read the diary and many letters that I left you in the past. I think: This will be beneficial to you.</p>
<p>I hope that you can humbly and carefully read it. Then, in my words, you will naturally find all the underlying meaning. And the degree to which you misunderstand me and fail to understand me will not reach such a sad point as it is today!</p>
<p>Let me tell you: The blood stains of my life in these four or five years, the pain and suffering I have endured, the cruel, painful, and inhumane things of the 八間 I have all encountered. Although various scars are engraved on my body, they are indeed the only marks that motivate me and encourage me to struggle. In my heart, there is no seed of decay, no cowardly qualities, and no hopeless sorrow for "life"! I am still full of a burning desire for survival, still filled with亢昂 and indignation. Towards the dark and corrupt society, towards this "disaster" world in which we live, I, like everyone else, am working hard to destroy it, for the happiness and freedom of millions upon millions of people!</p>
<p>In short, my ideal, my deeds, and that kind of natural and innocent affection for you, you, who have been my sincere friend for many years, should understand.</p>
<p>But, the gap between us is like a deep chasm.</p>
<p>Why did we have such terrible things happen this time?</p>
<p>Regarding this answer, I feel unfortunate.</p>
<p>Thinking about the interruption of our six or seven years of long-standing friendship, because of me, I heard a friend praise you: you therefore feel that life is boring, and you suddenly feel disheartened about people and affairs. Recalling your behavior and understanding your heart, I really feel deeply immeasurable楚痛 and 凄凉.</p>
<p>Let me tell you, during a period of life, I put a lot of effort into observing you. I found your 多 and narrowness, your selfishness and arrogance, your ideals and views, your excessively blind love for me, this is the source of the tragedy between us.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I heard Mr. D say... Because you were subjected to all kinds of oppression, stimulation, and dissatisfaction with your current life, you actually committed suicide. Fortunately, it didn't succeed. But this really makes me so悚然 and駭然!</p>
<p>Why did you think of such a cowardly place? Do you think that dying—dying in vain like this—will arouse people's sympathy for you? Will this end your困窘 fate? Can this get rid of this evil and卑汚 world?</p>
<p>No. That way of thinking is wrong. The sins of the world will not decrease because of your death. Darkness still envelops our surroundings. Pain still closely follows you.</p>
<p>Don't be so痴吧, they will treat you with a mocking attitude. And you are just in vain, meaningless, worthless like a dog, being躱 in a hole, are you willing? Are you willing to sacrifice your own precious life?</p>
<p>This is not worth it. And, that's such a stupid thing!</p>
<p>Whenever I am touched by these things, intense and tragic pain is stirred up in my heart. Thinking of the warm taste of your care for me, arising from your sincere love for me, I, who have been your faithful, intimate, and helpful friend, should shoulder what a great responsibility for your future.</p>
<p>Struggle, seek survival from the bloodbath!</p>
<p>Don't make a single gamble with your own life.</p>
<p>Although the earth is filled with the groans of endless suffering,</p>
<p>But in it, you will hear pleasant sounds,</p>
<p>That is the symphony of great life, and happiness is entrusted in it!</p>

<h3 id="e219">Foreigners Forbid Overseas Chinese from Reading Chinese Books and Newspapers <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>In recent years, our overseas Chinese compatriots have also suffered national disasters along with the motherland, and have been bullied by foreigners everywhere. Those who have been ordered to be expelled have returned to the motherland in batches like stray dogs. Those who still live abroad are constantly subjected to unreasonable oppression. This time, the Chinese and natives in the Dutch East Indies had armed clashes, and the lives and properties of overseas Chinese compatriots are even more in danger. But the suffering of our overseas Chinese compatriots is not only economically squeezed out, but even the freedom to read books and newspapers is interfered with. Previously, the Siamese government's implementation of banning Chinese schools, forcing Chinese schools to teach Siamese, and prohibiting the import of Chinese newspapers and magazines can be described as the ultimate in oppression. Singapore authorities have recently taken steps to ban the use of Chinese textbooks in overseas Chinese schools. Most recently, the government of Dutch West Borneo has gone even further, and even wants to burn Chinese books on a regular basis. All of these retrograde actions not only hinder the education of overseas Chinese, but also insult the dignity of China. It is the due right of overseas Chinese to read Chinese books and newspapers. Foreigners must interfere arbitrarily, which is to deprive people of their freedom.</p>
<p>Checking the foreigners' restrictions on our overseas Chinese compatriots from reading Chinese books and newspapers, their malicious intentions are deeply worth noting. For example, this time the government of Dutch West Borneo implemented a ban on Chinese textbooks, because it was discovered that some of the student compositions revised by the teacher of the Kundian Good Shepherd School were considered "uninspected", "the wording was激烈的", "containing political incitement", and "malice to alienate the nation", so the authorities believed that it violated local laws and decided to burn it. This kind of action is a bit too unreasonable. It is heard that the Overseas Chinese Federation was extremely indignant after receiving the report and will make some representation. But how should we express it? There must be a practical way to resist.</p>

<p>— Ni</p>
<p>Looking at the full, round, crystal-clear, and bright moon in the mid-sky, blowing the习习 light and quick breeze, the beautiful scenery of the Pearl River Night Moon suddenly floats into my mind. Indeed, it once intoxicated my childish heart and spent a part of my very valuable youth! How can I not miss it, eternally miss it? Although I have shouldered the heavy burden of a tedious home, walking with heavy steps, and moving towards the ethereal and bitter taste of the journey of life, I have left the beautiful Pearl River scenery that once intoxicated my childish heart for a long time. However, its tranquil beauty, the wide and winding river surface, the smooth like a large mirror, the light,碧绿 clear waves, the "spring colors" inside the boat buildings and painted boats, and the lush, verdant, and飘逸荔枝 orchards on both sides of the river... all these beautiful postures are deeply imprinted on my 残伤 heart, and whenever the jade plate-like moon hangs in the deep blue sky, my 잔상 broken heart seems to be刮 up a狂大 wind,掀起了 countless ripples of waves, recalling the past joy, and the present潦倒, 凄凉, the Pearl River 풍월's relics, old feelings, are all勾撩起来 by the coy and crystal-clear moon's smile.</p>
<p>Now it is also the season when the榴花 of Lingnan is blooming and the lychee seeds are already red! In this blazing heat of the scorching heat, people, like snakes in the tropics, are tired, and the people of 棉市 (Guangzhou) will definitely feel the terribleness of the 溽暑 and be forced to come to the Pearl River. Therefore, the swimming grounds in the eastern and western suburbs will also begin to feel not cold and clear, lonely, and鬧哄哄翻騰着 many健美哥儿們 and娘儿們. I recognized the嫻靜幽美的 posture of the "Pearl River Night Moon" in a summer a few years ago that吠着惊 heat of the southern wind, at that time, I had just returned to the motherland from Nanyang for the first time. Whenever dusk approached, the sun收斂了 its hot and poisonous light, quietly and lazily钻沈 into the back of the lychee orchards on the west bank of the river, then, this wide and winding stream of the Pearl River, the west suburb of the branch of the Lychee Bay, in the gentle飄拂 of the cool evening wind, it feels particularly縹緻,秀美, and full of a 로맨틱 atmosphere. At that time, in my innocent and innocent heart, I really didn't know that there was a so-called辛, 酸, 苦, 澀 taste in the world, my whole mind and body were 심취 in the beautiful scenery like a美人儿's embrace. On the nights when the moon was round and round, the quiet and tranquil Pearl River's澄碧 flowing water was dotted with countless twinkling and brilliant皎潔银光, at this time, I always liked to偕着 a few知友, rent a quick little boat 欵乃乃, 动荡 to the middle of the river, sitting in the cabin, 미폐着 my eyes, quietly listening to the slight and rhythmic sound of the flowing water激荡 from under the boat, or the low回清脆小調 song of the boat girl抱在懷里 on the楼头 of the painted boats on both sides of the bank, this is also a别有风趣赏心乐事的玩意儿! If the wine comes, you may wish to沽 a few pounds of "Qingmei", and buy some seasonal water vegetables, while singing to the wine, while appreciating the晶莹皎洁 Pearl River Night Moon in the mid-sky, letting the boat float down with the flowing water, and when the wine意闌珊 reaches the飄飄然境地, it is okay to引吭 high song,大開喉嚨, to come to a没有调儿吟哦 "浓" sing it, if the throat is hoarse or thirsty, you can also 捨舟登陸, in the garden-style swimming room on the embankment, casually have a cup of shaved ice,潤潤嗓音: If you feel a little hungry in your stomach, and you are lazy to go to Xiguan for refreshments, there is the famous "艇仔粥" in the river, which you can任凭 you eat a淋漓痛快. These leisurely and beautiful scenes, which are fully染着罗曼司 atmosphere, although they have been隔绝 for many years, and have迈进 the journey of life like a 繁累 life, however, those, but also清清楚楚印留在残碎心旌, 永远怀念着 it!</p>
<p>When I recall the beautiful "Pearl River Night Moon", there is a bit of酸溜溜 in my heart. Ah, I have迈进 the boundless journey of life.</p>

<p>— Ai Tu</p>
<p>From the North Shanghai Railway Station, I boarded a third-class carriage, the train carrying me southward as if in a frenzy. It was morning, and the sun, with the tenderness and shyness of a virgin, was peeking out with a reddish glow from between the bamboo groves of the east or the valleys of the high mountains. It was beautiful and lovely, and it contained a deep, rustic country air. It was also like an innocent child, smiling with its mouth open.</p>
<p>The train roared with a frenzied tune. The sound of the iron wheels grinding against the snake-like rails was so harsh it nearly deafened the travelers.</p>
<p>From the train window, one could see a vast expanse of emerald green fields, with soft grass swaying in the breeze. On the high mountains, apart from the colors peeking through the dense forests, there were sparsely scattered tombs hiding the skulls of the dead, silently squatting among the peaks. We can see these relics everywhere, and we can see the southern people's reverence and filial piety towards their ancestors. However, I could only glance at these scenes with a faint eye from inside the train, feeling nothing in particular.</p>
<p>Only the thoughts of a wanderer missing his home were especially encouraging.</p>
<p>At this moment, I thought of my old, dilapidated home. The old home stood desolate in that declining village, and my poor mother was waiting with wide eyes for her son, who had been wandering far away for many years, to return. Yes, I will never forget that I left her a long time ago in a moment of confusion, quietly escaping from that terrible circle.</p>
<p>However, what am I going back for now? Can</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>that pitiful home still offer me any reason to linger? No! No! I hate the dark hometown, I've hated it since I was a child. Yet, I love my poor old mother. Isn't her hair white and aren't there many wrinkles on her brow? Doesn't she love her young son?</p>
<p>Thinking this, my heart unconsciously became tense and sad.</p>
<p>Quickly, the high mountains and green waters flashed past my eyes, one after another.</p>
<p>When the train arrived at a station in my hometown, the sun was radiating a vivid virgin-like color, gently welcoming the returning wanderer. Getting off the train, the station was still the same as many years ago, except that two new Western-style houses had been built. Looking out from the front of the station, a deep lake with shimmering white waves reflected the beautiful sunlight. The reeds along the shore of the lake were long, swaying gently in the wind. As soon as I saw this scene, I remembered when I was a naive and lively child, often barefoot, catching fish and shrimp in the shallow waters of the lake, sometimes hiding in the reeds to play. That was the past, and now it's just something to long for. Therefore, when some children who didn't know me tilted their heads to look at me, I couldn't help but curse myself, "Ah! I've wandered for so many days, and what have I gained to offer my hometown?" Shameful, ah! Just a body full of terrible wounds!</p>
<p>Leaving the train station and dragging my feet back to my village, I saw the branches and leaves of the village's bamboo grove swaying, emitting a rustling sound, seeming to sigh, or perhaps mock me. However, I finally bravely stepped over the threshold of my old home.</p>
<p>The house was as silent as death. The ground seemed to be covered with green moss, and a cold air emanated from the dark house, causing the wandering son to feel sorrow: "Where is the home from my childhood? It's too desolate here!" Indeed, I remember very clearly that when I was a child, my brothers and I were always laughing and jumping around, seemingly unaware of sorrow. Now, the pitiful old home has been immersed in a circle without sunlight.</p>
<p>The frail old mother ran out. The sudden return of her son filled her with surprise, and tears of joy welled up in her eyes:</p>
<p>"Ah! You've come back! I've been dreaming of your return!"</p>
<p>Yes, she had always been waiting for her son's return in her dreams. When her unusual face stirred my heart, I could only say a sighing sentence that couldn't comfort her wounds:</p>
<p>"Yes! Mother, I have returned safely!"</p>
<h3 id="e222">Mr. San <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Er Lang</p>
<p>Although Mr. San seemed to be a foreign academician in the eyes of the villagers, he had never held an official position outside. He had only worked in academic professions such as university provost and university professor. This time, when he returned home for the summer vacation, the villagers treated it as a major event of "returning home in glory," congratulating him and giving gifts for several days. They simply regarded him as even more important than the township head, and some even publicly declared, "Now that Mr. San has returned in glory, we should elect him as the township head so that we can all have prestige."</p>
<p>One day, when the township head went to the city, a case of robbery and attempted murder occurred in the village. Everyone escorted the bandit and the victim to Mr. San's house, saying, "Mr. San's word is final. You can decide how to handle it. There's no need to wait for the township head to return." The villagers respected and admired him that much. However, after questioning about the case, the victim was unwilling to be the plaintiff and only begged for a quick resolution. This made Mr. San hesitate. The case occurred as follows: —</p>
<p>The owner of the small cigarette shop at the village entrance bought twenty or so packs of cigarettes from the city and asked Lao Da, who pushed a cart, to bring them home as a favor. Unexpectedly, on the way, Lao Da was knocked unconscious by a man with a stick, who stole the cigarettes and ran away. After he woke up, he shouted "Robber!" as he chased after him. Villagers gathered from the fields and caught the man. They had already beaten him, which would have been enough to release him, but someone said, "We have always been peaceful here. We have never had a case of robbery and attempted murder like this. That's unacceptable!" So they brought him to Mr. San's house.</p>
<p>"Escort him to the county," Mr. San said. However, the cigarette shop owner pleaded, "Don't escort him to the county, Mr. San. I beg you to do me a favor." Mr. San was surprised and widened his eyes. "Why don't you want to escort him to the county?" The owner said, "You know, twenty or so packs of cigarettes are only worth twenty or so dollars. Even if they were stolen, it would be nothing. Even treating the injured Lao Da, who pushes the cart, wouldn't cost much. If we escort him to the county, you know, I'd have to close my shop and accompany him to the county for the trial, ask a scribe to write the indictment, and curry favor with everyone in the county. Twenty or so dollars wouldn't even cover the expenses."</p>
<p>Mr. San lowered his eyelids, thinking. "There's some truth to that. But if we don't escort him to the county, what should we do?" He walked a circle in the room, the eyes of the crowd following his footsteps, silently. Suddenly, Mr. San stopped and said, "If we don't escort him to the county, let's escort him to the district office." The owner was still adamant, "Mr. San, please do me a favor and just beat him and let him go. If we escort him to the district office, I would still have to accompany him for a trip, and no one would take care of my shop's business." Mr. San ignored him, and with a wave of his hand, the villagers pulled the man away. The owner sighed, knowing that trouble was inevitable, and didn't dare to grumble anymore, following the villagers out of Mr. San's house.</p>
<p>The man knelt on the ground in Mr. San's house, crying and weeping, tears and snot flowing together. Mr. San had also been moved by his compassion. However, the case was too serious, "robbery and attempted murder," how could Mr. San dare to release him?</p>
<p>However, the next day, it was said that the man had run away in the night. The district office had a militia, how could he have escaped? The person reporting said, "The cigarette shop owner used money to have the militia release him." Mr. San nodded and smiled. The responsibility was now the district office's, nothing to do with him. The reason why he, Mr. San, didn't dare to release him yesterday was because of the issue of responsibility. Now it was good, he had no responsibility. When the township head returned, he would have an explanation. He smiled and said, "That man is also quite pitiful." Therefore, he thought that if there hadn't been that stick, he wouldn't have committed a crime.</p>
<p>However, another question lingered in Mr. San's mind: The villagers were afraid of going to the county government, which showed that the corrupt judicial practices of the county government had not been eliminated.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Under the Banyan Tree <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Wu</p>
<p>The south wind brought the summer season. Half-red and half-white lotus flowers bloomed in the lotus pond, with green leaves interspersed between the red and white flowers, making the pond even more vibrant.</p>
<p>The cicadas chirped loudly in the treetops; looking up, the lush greenery completely blocked the sun, occasionally a few faint rays of sunlight sneaking through the gaps, turning into scattered spots of light under a large patch of shade. The scent of lush green leaves drifted in the breeze, and lingering under the shade of this tree to admire the scenery of the lotus pond made it especially easy to feel as leisurely as recalling ancient times or reminiscing about the past. At least, here, I felt separated from the chaotic and turbulent real world by many centuries. If I were a famous scholar flipping through ancient books or some kind of poet or lyricist, this would be a great place to chant or admire. Unfortunately, I am just an ordinary person, and under the tight coercion of the whip of life, this can only be my only place of rest.</p>
<p>I have no home. I am rushing on a road that will never end, ever since the year I fell from my mother's womb until now. — Perhaps just like a lost fledgling, flying around with a large flock of birds. But I don't know where my home is. Vaguely, I found a broken plank in the sea, no, I found a deserted island; so I stayed on this deserted island, lingering under this banyan tree for this time…</p>
<p>During the day, I wrapped two rough loaves of bread in half a piece of old newspaper and walked to the edge of this pond. As soon as I reached the shade of the banyan tree, my steps suddenly stopped, and without needing to choose, I sat down on the grass and stuffed the bread into my mouth like a hungry tiger. Sometimes, I would also wade into the pond to pick one or two lotus flowers, peel off the petals and scatter them on the ground, then spread the tender yellow stamens on the grass to dry them and take them home to use as tea.</p>
<p>Night after night, the stars in the sky shone with burning eyes. I wandered alone under the shade of the tree, listening to the croaking of frogs late at night. The green fields fell into a boundless darkness, and my tiny eyes could not see the vast horizon. Occasionally, I saw a few specks of light and heard some sounds of wind blowing through the grass, as well as slow and steady footsteps. There were still people catching frogs in the fields day and night, so in my own desolate heart, I also found some comfort.</p>
<p>I have no sorrow. Forever embracing a lonely heart, following a group of older and more elderly people, drifting from here to there, now I have drifted to this deserted island. But where is that group? They have already fallen, one by one, like autumn leaves, in the midst of dangerous wind and rain. From then on, only I was left alone.</p>
<p>I lingered under the banyan tree, recalling the past. I felt that I could no longer be alone. When I heard those distant footsteps, I stubbornly struggled up from the ground again. Looking at the branches and trunk of the banyan tree, I felt that it was not yet old, and I myself was still young. The summer wind could not blow away the leaves of youth, I could still struggle and continue my future — weren't there still a group of young people like me ahead? …</p>

<p>Opening Piece "Crying for Huang Haichao" (Manuscript by Chen Zizhen)</p>
<p>In this world, everything is empty. Huang Haichao unfortunately met his end. In the past, he was always strong and healthy. Who would have known that a disease would separate us forever? I cry for Huang Haichao, who served at the radio station until now. A life dedicated to art, now all in vain. I cry for Huang Haichao, who was gentle and honest, treating people and things with sincerity. I cry for Huang Haichao, you were not greedy for wealth and did not love beauty, a true model of propriety, justice, integrity, and honor. I cry for Huang Haichao, I always hoped that your illness would lessen, but unexpectedly, the disease was incurable and you entered a dream. I cry for Huang Haichao, the doctors were incompetent, the medicine was ineffective, and there was no relief. I cry for Huang Haichao, leaving behind your elderly parents in the hall, leaving behind your listeners everywhere. I cry for Huang Haichao, leaving behind your wife in the room, pregnant with six months of grief. The more I think about it, the more heartbroken I feel, and I realize that life is full of emptiness. In life, people fight for wealth and property, but after death, they hold nothing in their hands. With vast fortunes and family wealth, people vanish without a trace upon death. Life is like hundreds of flowers blooming in spring, and death is like yellow leaves falling in autumn wind. It's pitiful that you have no brothers, sisters, or siblings; how can your parents not be heartbroken? I cry out, tears streaming down, dreaming as if constantly crying my soul out. It's as if ten thousand steel knives are stabbing my heart. It's pitiful that you can't take your beloved possessions with you, and you're separated forever upon death. Life is busy and empty.</p>

<p>On the 25th, the Shanghai Opera Society did not appear at the New World Zhongshan Building, reportedly due to a verbal conflict with someone from the entertainment group.</p>
<p>Miss Hongye (Sun Man) performed "Street Singing Song" on the stage of the New World Zhongshan Building on the 24th, which was well received by the audience.</p>
<p>Mr. Yun Huifang, a patriotic person, is now preparing a newly emerging amateur singing group "Shangxue Society". It is reported that a meeting will be held at the Maisheng School on the 31st of this month to discuss all the procedures.</p>
<p>Since the Qiyin Singing Society began its free performances at the New World, requests have been pouring in from all walks of life. The society broadcast a special program at the Lili Radio Station from 7:15 PM to 8:15 PM yesterday afternoon, and the number of requests from all walks of life was overwhelming.</p>
<p>The Yangguang Singing Society, jointly organized by Yang Huishu and Ni Peng, is about to be established.</p>
<p>The Youth Carnival Society and the Youth Drama Society are now handled by Shi Bin and others. I have already resigned, so I hereby declare.</p>
<p>It is said that Misses Li Ying and Xu Qi Liu Lin have become sworn sisters. Is this true? (Above Tao Qie)</p>
<p>Recently, I have received wireless radio news from several enthusiastic comrades. Although there has long been a "broadcasting machine" in New Shanghai, it is inevitable that there will be suspicion of plagiarism, but I cannot live up to the enthusiasm of the contributors, and perhaps this is what the readers of this newspaper are looking forward to. Therefore, I also have a "radio beam" column, but I hope that everyone will not pick randomly when writing, and applause from the backstage will make the readers headache, and please do not deliberately hurt others. It is not good to start a pen war, and it is a small matter, or even an unfortunate accident may occur. (Editor)</p>

<p>There has been a lot of rain this autumn, and floods have occurred in various provinces, rivers have burst their banks, people and animals have suffered, and all kinds of tragic situations are unbearable to see. People in Shanghai, who are spared this disaster, cannot but think of the cries of despair in the fields when they are warm and well-fed. Benevolent gentlemen, if they can cut back on food and clothing and transfer funds to help, the violence of the disaster can also be saved. The Youth Association, Shanghai West Commune, and Art Wheel Film Company, in order to awaken their compatriots and seek salvation together, are specially holding a wonderful new drama performance at the Shanghai West Commune on Robertison Road for four days, and all the ticket proceeds will be allocated to the floods in various provinces (ticket prices are divided into two corners and one corner). The preliminary preparations are now roughly in place. It is reported that all walks of life are sympathizing with the disaster relief and are working very hard to sell seat tickets. The dates and programs are recorded as follows: August 31st The World's First Filial Daughter, Night Before Episode of Grudges and Dreams, September 1st Hero Passing the Beauty Pass, Night After Episode of Grudges and Dreams, September 2nd Money is All Evil, Night Family Disaster, September 3rd One Yuan, Night Falling Flower Tears.</p>

<p>— Shao</p>
<p>Starting Today at the Guanyun Club</p>
<p>Film star and playwright Mr. Tan Zhiyuan, in addition to concentrating on the art of film and drama, also studies the six Ren fortune telling and Taoist philosophy in his spare time. For more than ten years, he has mastered it deeply. Every time he casts a fortune and gives a fate prediction to his friends, it is always effective. Now, in the face of the severe flood disaster and the refugees all over the field, he specially sets up a writing desk in the Guanyun Jingshe Club on the west side of Dongxin Bridge on Aiduo Road, and publicly provides fortune telling to ladies from all walks of life. Whether it is casting a fortune or making a detailed life prediction, the remuneration will be reduced uniformly, one is to guide ladies from all walks of life out of the labyrinth, and the other is to gather strength and enthusiasm to help the disaster. It is a win-win situation, but Mr. Tan's efforts for the disaster victims this time are especially due to the strong support of Mr. Lin Yongkang, the president of the Guanyun Society, which cannot be considered unenthusiastic. It is also heard that the society is planning internal expansion, adding a drama division, and widely soliciting members. It is heard that Mr. Tan will be hired as the director of the drama division.</p>

<p>Night: A non-official test screening of the sound film "The Tempest" in the newly built sound screening room of Yihua.</p>
<p>People involved in the work of "The Tempest" came in one by one, and the rows of seats were filled. The fan whirred, the windows were closed, the lights were turned off, and a beam of white light shot from a small hole in the back wall onto the white curtain in front. The rhythm of the music sounded in the loudspeaker, and three big, convex letters "The Tempest" pierced everyone's eyes, followed by the cast and crew list, and a burst of applause.</p>
<p>The beginning of the scene was a long shot, a sea ship advancing rapidly in the boundless sea. In an instant, the camera reached the interior of the ship, and the passengers in the first-class cabin were enjoying the performance of the world-famous "Red Rose Dance Troupe" from overseas to China. A large group of naked Western dancers sang and danced in the ever-changing scenery, the musicians frantically played, and the audience stared wide-eyed, focusing on the dancers' thighs and breasts, a close-up, the screen full of the dancers' thighs.</p>
<p>"Wonderful, how intoxicating it is!" Someone blurted out.</p>
<p>"Shh..." A burst of repercussions.</p>
<p>"Wipe..." One shot after another, one scene after another.</p>
<p>At half past ten, the play was over, and everyone came out. Yuan Yemei's face was dyed with a triumphant smile as everyone celebrated the success.</p>
<p>"Ichimoku Saburo, I wish you success in playing the Japanese."</p>

<p>Theaters and cinemas, in order to rectify the audience, do not allow those from the lower class society who are barefoot and not wearing socks to enter the seats. However, modern women who expose their jade toes and wear hollow-out leather shoes can enter and leave gracefully, and the waiters serve them for fear of being inadequate. This is indeed an incomprehensible strange problem. In the "Peach Blossom Dream" directed by Mr. Du Yu of the Shanghai Film Company, the above situation is adopted in the performance, which is funny and abrupt, and has never been seen before, and the seriousness of the poor and rich classes is implicitly contained in it. Mr. Du Yu's intelligence can be seen here.</p>

<h3 id="e233">Experiment on the Number of Times Brakes are Used <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>How many times on average does a driver on the road need to stop the car to avoid pedestrians or due to traffic obstructions? This is a very interesting question. From a driving perspective, it reveals how often the brakes are used by the average person. Now, the question has been answered through practical experimentation: an average driver on a busy street stops the car approximately once every minute. In other words, brakes are used about every sixty seconds.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned frequency of brake usage is not based on mere calculation but on actual field experiments. This experiment was conducted by the Automobile Club of Michigan in the United States. In order to find a qualified "typical" driver, they carefully selected participants who were neither complete beginners nor experienced professionals. Both categories were considered unsuitable; beginners lack the necessary skills, and professionals are too advanced. Therefore, they chose a woman named Eve F. Lindsey for this testing. The Plymouth Motor Corporation supported this endeavor, and the results were highly satisfactory.</p>
<p>Ms. Lindsey drove a new Plymouth sedan. The entire journey lasted eight hours. During these eight hours, Ms. Lindsey used the brakes a total of 547 times. To ensure accuracy and proper recording, a connected "stop counter" was installed next to the brake pedal. Thus, every time the brakes were applied, the counter faithfully recorded it.</p>
<p>The experiment took place in Detroit, the well-known automotive manufacturing center of the United States, under the supervision of officials from the Michigan Automobile Club. To ensure impartiality, two notaries public were present at the start and end to inspect everything. The start was overseen by John Flaherty of the local police traffic committee, and Captain Wesley Brown of the Public Safety Bureau was responsible for verifying the stop counter records at the finish line. Ms. Lindsey drove on various roads in different areas. Some parts of the city were bustling, while others were quiet. In busy areas, the population was dense, and traffic was naturally heavy. In quiet areas, the population was sparse, and the traffic situation was different. Moreover, the time of day also had a significant impact. In the morning, suburban residents were busy going to the city and business centers, causing heavy traffic in the urban areas. Conversely, in the late afternoon, people returned to the suburbs, creating a traffic jam on the connecting roads, resembling a long, endless belt. Ms. Lindsey drove in these diverse environments, using the brakes only when absolutely necessary, based on the surrounding conditions. Therefore, she did not overuse the brakes during the entire journey.</p>
<p>The frequency of Ms. Lindsey's brake usage varied depending on the time of day and traffic conditions. During the first hour and a half of her driving, she used the brakes a total of 100 times, meaning she stopped 100 times. Between 11:00 AM and 1:00 PM, she stopped 34 times, but from 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM, she stopped 88 times. This is likely due to the lunch hour in urban areas, when many people are on the road. Especially in areas with concentrated offices, employees rush into the streets as soon as the clock strikes twelve, increasing the number of pedestrians. When cars encounter pedestrians crossing the road, they naturally have to brake to avoid them, thus increasing the frequency of brake usage.</p>
<p>The experiment lasted eight hours. During this time, Ms. Lindsey traveled a total distance of 143.3 miles, with an average speed of slightly over 18 miles per hour. This speed was considered moderate, not particularly high, mainly because the areas she traversed did not allow for faster driving. There were also continuous streams of vehicles and pedestrians. Ms. Lindsey's maximum speed during the entire journey was only 30 miles per hour, and most of the time, her speed was around 25 miles per hour.</p>
<p>After the experiment, Mr. Halsted stated that the results showed that reliable and effective brakes are essential for driving in urban areas and cannot be ignored. Ms. Lindsey used the brakes nearly once a minute, or three times per mile. Therefore, Mr. Halsted concluded that he was very impressed with these numbers, and other drivers should deeply understand the importance of brakes in driving.</p>
<h3 id="e234">Important Notes on Tire Usage <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Xing</p>
<p>Tire Pressure: Always keep tire pressure within the specified limits. The normal tire pressure limit is the minimum. It is never appropriate to reduce tire pressure slightly, but it should exceed it slightly. For example, if the specified tire pressure is 32 pounds, the pressure should be inflated to 34 pounds. Check tire pressure weekly. If it is found to be slightly reduced, it must be replenished. A good tire will not leak more than two pounds of air per week. If it reaches this number, it is necessary to pay close attention to the tire, especially the valve. An old inner tube is, of course, more likely to leak than a new one. If your inner tube is too old and leaks quickly, it is better to replace it with a new inner tube to avoid excessive wear and tear on the outer tire due to insufficient air pressure. Excessive air pressure will cause unexpected wear and tear on the center of the tire, and insufficient air pressure will cause undue damage to both sides of the tire.</p>
<p>Whenever you remove and reinstall a tire, or install a new tire, do not start driving long distances until you are sure that the air pressure is appropriate. The reason is that when a tire is mounted on a steel rim and begins to run, it is subjected to extremely strong pressure, which will leak several pounds of air and damage your tire due to insufficient air pressure. Therefore, the best way is to inflate the tire fully after it is mounted, drive four or five miles, stop the car, and check it. If it is found to be insufficient, it must be replenished immediately. New tires leak more quickly in the first few weeks of use and should also be noted.</p>
<p>Do not always use tires on the same wheels. By constantly moving your tires from one wheel to another, the wear and tear on the tires can be greatly reduced. Your spare tire must also be included in the rotation process and should not be left unused for more than six months, as it will wear out very quickly over time. Therefore, a more economical way to use tires is to rotate them on all wheels of the car. After many car experiences, engineers have established a cyclical rotation method to facilitate implementation. Every time the car travels 5,000 miles (8,000 kilometers), the tires can be rotated clockwise, that is, move the right front tire to the right rear wheel, the right rear tire to the spare wheel, and the spare wheel to the left rear wheel, and so on. If there are two spare tires, both must be included in the rotation. Another valuable task is often overlooked, and you must also pay attention to it. If one side of the steel rim of the wheel is always facing the outside of the car, the tire should be rotated on the same wheel from time to time. The side facing outward can be changed to face inward. A tire that is often used on the same wheel will inevitably cause uneven wear and tear. For example, the degree of wear of the front and rear tires must be different. The tires on the left side are more prone to damage because they are more accessible to the roadside, and the tire walls may be scratched by the street edges.</p>
<p>It is generally believed that the danger of a rear tire bursting is less than that of a front tire bursting, so old tires are installed on the rear wheels. This view should not be relied upon. That is not right. Many trials have proven that the danger caused by a burst tire on the rear wheel is not less than the front tire. When the road surface is slippery, if the rear tire bursts, the tire will immediately go flat, and the anti-skid tread will lose its effect. The rear end of the car is the part that receives power to propel the vehicle forward, which will increase the skidding of the vehicle to a surprising degree. The danger at this time is indeed greater than the burst of the front tire. For this reason, tires that are in relatively good condition but without tread should be avoided as much as possible on the rear wheels.</p>
<p>Unless driving fire trucks, ambulances and police vehicles, do not turn at high speeds, as this damages tires more than anything else. When you turn the steering wheel at high speed, the tires will naturally turn with it, but the tires are still moving forward due to inertia. In this way, the tire wall is subjected to a terrible squeeze, and the entire tire will slide over to one side of the road by an inch or more. If you want to know how much damage this causes to the tire, you can take a new tire, make a mark, and press it with all your strength to make it roll forward and backward on a new concrete road six inches wide about 500 times, and then check it. The degree of wear and tear is often less than that of a new tire mounted on a car turning at 50 miles per hour.</p>
<p>Except to avoid causing an accident, do not use the brakes violently. Violent use of the brakes will damage the brake bands, brake drums, and other parts of the vehicle, not to mention, but it can have terrible results on the tires. When you have braked the wheels to a stop, inertia still forces the car to move forward. Therefore, if the braking action is very sudden, the car will slide forward, and it may wipe off a large piece of rubber from your four tires. In addition, violent use of the brakes will cause severe vibrations to the bottom edge of the tire, causing damage to the rubber weaving layer and the junction between the two. Therefore, the brakes must be used very gently so as not to cause unexpected damage to the tires. The braking force applied to the four wheels should be evenly consistent, otherwise some tires will be subjected to the same wear and tear mentioned above. Therefore, a good brake calibration device must be carried with you at all times so that it can be used to calibrate the brakes so that they are evenly consistent.</p>
<p>Your wheels must be inspected and calibrated regularly, both front and rear wheels. To ensure accurate calibration, it can be performed by specialized personnel. Whether there is anything wrong with the front wheels must be checked with a certain device. Any speculation will not be accurate. If your car is old, and the inspection reveals that some parts have worn out, causing the vehicle to sway, you must repair it, or even replace the new bearing, steering pin and bushing. A swaying wheel will leap off the ground, which is extremely damaging to the tire. If you cannot calibrate the wheels correctly and cannot correct the swaying of the wheels, you will not only greatly increase the cost of tire repair, but also frequently change new tires. In addition, the swaying tire causes irregular friction between the tire and the road surface, so no matter how strong the tire is, it will inevitably suffer unexpected wear and tear.</p>
<p>Inspect your tires from time to time for anything stuck in them. If stone chips are embedded in the tread pattern of the tire, they must be removed. If they are left in, they will pierce the tread and weaving layer, causing the weaving layer to be damaged and broken. This will cause the tire to burst and vulcanize. The safest way is to use a swirl chisel from time to time to remove the stone chips stuck in the tire. If there are small nails and other sharp objects, they should be removed one by one.</p>
<p>If the speed is too high, the tire will generate high heat. If the tire is overheated due to the climate, the wear and tear will exceed the normal level. When the climate is cool and the road is wet, the heat of the tire can be dissipated, and the wear and tear can be reduced. Therefore, the degree of tire wear and tear in winter and during the two seasons is less than in summer. In extremely hot weather, driving on dry roads, coupled with extremely high speeds, the tires generate high heat and increase the speed of wear and tear. If the tires have already been damaged a lot, this situation can cause the tires to burst and other similar serious incidents.</p>
<p>Starting too abruptly causes the same damage to the tire as a sudden stop, but in the opposite direction. Starting too abruptly causes the wheels to slip and roll, and the tires are greatly damaged as a result. Therefore, under certain circumstances, you can start in second gear to prevent the wheels from slipping and damaging the tires.</p>
<p>Do not let the tires hit or run over the curbs. Such abuse will cause the tires to be injured. Your inner tube will be clamped by the steel rim, and the weaving layer will break due to loosening. After a few days or a month, your tire will burst as a result. If you still cannot find the real reason for the burst at this time, you will blame others unreasonably.</p>
<p>When you are driving, if you suddenly feel that the steering is different, you must slowly stop the car and carefully check each tire according to law. This is often caused by the tire about to burst. In this way, you can not only find the defects of the tire, repair and replace it, and avoid danger, but also, the tire will not burst, and you can save a lot of repair costs.</p>

<p>Unifying the Period for Car Tax Certificates: Thomas Henry, president of the American Automobile Association, noting that thousands of cars are detained each year for expired tax certificates in various states, proposed that the period for car tax certificates should be unified across all states to avoid many troubles for drivers and all management disputes. According to Mr. Henry, the period for car tax certificates varies greatly among the states, and there are already many disputes. The confusion in the future will be even more significant. If the country can stipulate a uniform period for tax certificates, the benefits will certainly be many. In the forty states and the District of Columbia in the United States, the period for car registration and tax certificates begins on January 1st, and the end and grace dates vary. Alabama starts taxing from October 1st, South Carolina on November 1st, South Dakota on April 1st, Vermont on April 1st, Virginia on April 1st, Utah on March 1st, and West Virginia on July 1st. Mr. Henry also said that five states are currently proposing changes: Delaware, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin from January 1st to July 1st, Minnesota to April 14th, and Texas to July 1st. Henry finally hoped that the American Automobile Association would be able to rescue thousands of detained car drivers.</p>

<p>The Beiligu Piston Ring is made with its unique casting method. The amount of various components it contains has been carefully calculated and is accurate to the millimeter. For example, if the mixed carbon contained in the casting is less than 0.4%, it will not be accepted because it does not meet the durable conditions. Therefore, in terms of materials, Beiligu has reached the peak and cannot be compared with ordinary piston rings. In addition, all products must undergo more than 20 tests, and must be carefully checked to ensure that they have reached the perfect state before they are sold to the world. This is why its function is extraordinary, and it is indeed appropriate to install Beiligu in order to seek the most effective and economical engine. Beiligu has a complete range of sizes for various car engines, such as Ford, Chevrolet, Austin, Murray, Shunfeng, Standard, and Ober, etc. There are complete sets for people to install.</p>
