<h3>談民衆常識指導</h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>孫中山先生遺囑有云。國民革命之目的在求中國之自由平等。欲達到此目的。必須喚起民衆。此言也。不但革命同志所當服膺。卽一般受過相當教育之國民亦應奉為明訓。蓋立國於今日。非僅少數當局負有貫澈革命目的之責任。欲求充實國力。必以健全之大多數人民為基礎。戰後世界新興諸國。莫不以民衆教育為先務職是故耳。</p>
<p>我國自國民政府成立以來。教育當局對民衆教育非不努力推行。徒以經費之來源有限。未能充分發展。最近各地黨政機關奉中央命令。糾合當地各機關團體。籌備組織民衆常識指導委員會。就其所定指導項目及指導方法觀之。直民衆教育之另一方式耳。意者。黨政當局重視民衆教育而苦於為經濟所限。故有此變通之辦法乎。然地方人民團體。之主持者。亦當凛於革命導師之遺言。本「己欲立而立人」之古訓。黽勉為之而吾人於此。謹祝其能於最短期間收得切實之效果。為革命事業造設一深固之根柢。</p>
<p>惟推行伊始。千端萬緒。從何入手。亦一值得鄭重考慮之問題。吾人對此新事業具無限之熱望。不禁忘其愚陋。輒貢一得之見如次。</p>
<p>我国以農立國。人民百分之七八十居於鄉村。未受教育之人民。卽以此務農而居於鄉村者占最大多數。故民衆常識指導工作。似宜從鄉村開始。况關於農業及副業手工業之改善。運銷及貯藏方法之指導。立有專目。苟能在鄉村努力推行。對於目前農村經濟之衰落。正大有裨益也。</p>
<p>我國之社會組織。以經濟上之關係。尚以家庭為基本。家庭中之主要分子實為婦女。而婦女之未受教育者則較男子為多。故民衆常識之指導又應注重於婦女界。須知我國社會牢不可破之迷信。不衛生等舊習。正因婦女缺乏教育為厲堦。今指導項目中旣有關於家庭管理兒童之指示。以及關於衛生之宣傳等。故必多向婦女界用力方能見效。</p>
<p>近年各種社會運動。類多偏重城市及男子方面。竊以為獨此民衆常識指導之工作。如欲求其普遍而有效。必更注重鄉村及婦女界。始克有濟。</p>
<p>抑又有進者。「富而後教。」古聖人已言之。欲使民衆領受常識之指導。當先為解除其生活上之困苦。否則恐不免事倍而功半。竊願賢明當局三致意焉。</p>
<h3>總領事會議結論　有吉電告東京　廣田係廿一條起草人　未來對華政策堪注目　巴黎將召集日駐歐大使會議</h3>
<p>（東京）與對華新政策確立以重要指示之日本駐華總領事會議、關於中國各地徘日現况·排日取締·及排日取締令發布狀况等、有吉昨致電日外務省報告、又將於四月末歸國後、向廣田外相為詳細之報告、以為决定對華新　　　　之資、（十四日電通電）</p>
<p>東京訊、日本自退出國聯　生效力後、外務省為實現該國獨自之經濟外交及應付海軍會議等問題、着手外交工作之刷新整頓、駐華有吉公使受外省指示、在滬舉行總領會議、討論對華經濟商務等事宜、該會自本月八日開至十日、業已結束、待該公使返國後、將作詳細報告、駐英松平大使亦受外省指示、在六月下旬返國期前、將在巴黎舉行駐歐大使會議、出席者有佐藤（駐法）松村（駐意）武者小路（駐德）德川（駐土）有田（駐比）等五人、此外因國聯關係、召致崛田瑞士公使及橫山日內瓦總領事、會期二週問、討論英法德意中心之歐洲現狀、尤注意於由德國宣佈強迫兵役制而引起之動搖情形、將會議結果彙編報告書、由松平大使携帶返國、向外省報告、最近在南美方面、亦將開公使會議、討論日貨暢銷等問題、出席者有澤田（駐伯拉西爾）村上（秘魯）岩手（駐哥倫比爾）矢野（駐智利）山崎（駐阿根廷）等各公使云（世界社）</p>
<p>外論社云、密勒氏評論報載稱、本星期中、日本駐在中國各地、如北平天津漢口南京廣州濟南靑島上海福州厦門等處的外交和領事官吏、在上海開了三天的會議、由日本公使有吉氏為主席、據報上的消息、說會中討論的主要問題、就是關於取締華人的反日情感及抵制日貨運動、會中有一位人物頗為重要、此人為誰、卽為最近由日返華的日本駐華商務參贊橫竹氏、因為他在日本時、曾與廣田外相會議多次、更同日本工商及金融界領袖討論擴充日本在中國的商業勢力、充任會議主席的有吉公使預備不久返日、將中國時局和中日的「合作」情形、報告日本外交當局、</p>
<p>因為日本軍部和外務省的未來的對華政策、顯係分道揚鞭、各不相謀、所以要决定日本的第二步行動殊不可能、但是目下彼此雖各自為謀、如果一旦有事、則日本只有一種國家政策、决不能再長此分歧、而且這種政策大半將惟軍部的馬首是瞻、總而言之、世界聞名二十一條、實係由現任外相廣田所起草、目下時局之要點、卽為日本之努力欲稱覇於中國境內、同時日本之外務省則受其本國商人之壓迫、助其發展在華之營內、目下頗注意於妥洽之政策、日本軍部方面則對中國之統一、從事阻擾、對於寗粵兩方除挑撥惡感外、是沒有別的政策云、</p>

<h3>荷印限制日貨　日商決定對策　強化各出口組合機能　促請政府確立輸出權</h3>
<p>大阪　荷印政府曾於本年一月二十一日頒布七種商品之限制令、但至最近方開始對於脚踏車及塘瓷鐵器實行分配制度、惟對日貨之分配、實際上不過一成內外、而其他日貨僅為實施分配期間三分之一、尚未表示分配制者亦復不少、日本荷印貿易協會為應付此項形勢起見、巳於十三日在大阪商工會議所召集臨時總會恊議之結果、决定採取左列二項方法以便應付、（一）將實際情形呈報政府、依照通商擁護法、確立日本人之輸出權、以便對抗荷印方面之輸入權、（二）力圖各項出口聯合強化其機能、而採取協同一致之行動、茲為行使上項對策起見、應將商工省擬定之對荷印雜貨輸出聯合會提早使之創立、以便促進云云、（十四日日聯電）</p>
<h3>日本抨擊　美國商業政策　華府殊以為異</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）日本報紙對於美國之商業政策、大肆攻擊、顯係官塲示意、美國政府領袖對之、殊為驚異、且羅斯福總統及國務總理赫爾昨日與新英格蘭數洲洲長談話之時、巳曾對日表示好感、羅總統稱日本之棉織品對美輸出、若與美國之全部出品相比、猶斗水之一滴、故苟其日貨對於國內出產並無重大危險、政府不擬加以限止、况且目前並無問題、赫爾亦曾表示、謂美日兩國之商務關係、若與他國相比殊稱良佳、政府當局今日復稱、任何各國並無理由可信美國係在拉丁美洲鼓勵反對日貨之行動、若干官員則曾作私人表示、謂東京方面之攻擊、必係在未聞美國當局聲明之前所繕就云、若干專家以為美國在菲律濱亦且力避防碍日貨之舉動、官塲方面咸覺日美貿易關係殊為良好、故日本之態度如此、頗感莫名其妙云、（十三日國民電）</p>
<h3>美紗廠三家閉門　工人四千因之失業　受日貨傾銷影響</h3>
<p>波士頓　今日宣布、新英格蘭有紗廠三家停閉、將有工人四千失業、三廠當局皆反對棉產營業稅及美國南北紡織工人工資之不同、且稱日貨競爭亦為停閉之原因云、（十三日國民電）</p>

<p>昨夜英方未發表公報、殊出人意料、蓋會中决議一切消息暫不公布、而俟今日發表最後公報、二月三日英法議定書中所含各點、會議中均討論及之、且涉及其他各事、詳情將載於今日發表之公報中、</p>

<p>（日內瓦）法國致文國聯、抗議德國重置軍備之决定、詞頗嚴峻、謂國際事件、奈何以至成事實之方法代替談判方法、德國之實施強迫軍役及創立空軍、乃切實破壞凡爾塞和約第五章基本條文之舉動、如片面取銷國際義務之方法為衆採取、則不久除武力外、將別無他種政策之餘地、請國聯籌議適當計畫、以補救此局勢而杜效尤云、又謂德國秘密破壤和約、久已不成疑問、今則公然為之、莫可置辯、國聯不能對於直接達反國聯憑以成立的原則之政治手段、再淡漠視之、聽其猖獗、德國故意破壞其與國聯合作之基礎、而妨害日內瓦軍縮談判之成功、如契約義務之片面取銷、除道德上譴責外、不發生他種後果、則嗜好和平之國家繼續欲成立不侵犯與互商及互助諸公約、庸有價值乎、國聯行政院如欲盡其責任、則不能再漠視國際秩序中之重大危害云、此文將於明日由國聯行政院特別會議考慮云、（十四日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）法國政府為德國違約重整軍備一事、致國聯會行政院之申請書頃巳發表、申請書內謂、「德國背棄凡爾賽條約軍事條欵、秘密進行重整軍各、慘澹經營已歷多時、除目前所採行之程序外、德國五年度預算案內軍事經費大見增加、德備將國防軍改組為短期兵役制、故有此必要、此外并否認航空部預算係一種軍備預算云、查德國現在之軍制、决非數月內所可成就、由是則德國政府上述之否認及宣言、其眞意所在已然若揭、而其處　積慮更大足注意矣、申請書又謂、「德國對於規定德國軍制之和約條欵、視為廢紙、實屬有意毀壞德國與日內瓦組織合作之一基礎、至於法國前曾力圖限制軍備、且業經承認德國之軍備權平等、歐戰以後、法國曾將兵役年限、自三軍减為一軍、最近决定將兵役年限、暫時延長至兩年、實由新兵缺額之所致、法國此種措置、在五年前業經軍縮會議籌備委員會認為正當合法、今德國乃欲由單方面决定、以解决國際問題、熟知德國此種决定、勢必引起普遍重整軍備之問題、德國此種威脅國際秩序之舉動、國聯會行政院倘置之不問、則此後行政院將無法履行其使命、故考慮最適當之措置、以應付德國此種威脅、一方面救濟現在所已造成之局面、另一方面阻止此類事情之再行發生、實為國聯會行政院應有之責」云云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>各國要人　紛集日內瓦　李維諾夫作外交活動</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯會行政院非常會議、定於明日開會、蘇聯外交委員李維諾夫業於昨日來此、丹麥外交部長慕樞亦接踵而止、盤馬尼亞外長蒂杜樓斯哥曾於夜間往訪捷克外長貝奈斯·南斯拉夫常駐國聯會代表哥地池、此外李維諾夫曾與貝奈斯晤談、大概係就斯特里薩會議結果與俄捷兩國安全保障公約有所商洽、至英國外相西門·法國外長賴伐爾·及意大利代表阿樂亞西將於今晚到達、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>德政府闡明　對東歐維態度　認軍事互助補充條欸　於公維本身自相矛盾</h3>
<p>（柏林）昨日德當局發表長公報、闡明德國對於東歐公約之態度、並聲明德政府不能參加含有載見現有雙邊與多邊軍事協約中之軍事義務的公約、惟德國並不因此不與他國締結互不侵略公約、公報謂以軍事輔助義務補充互不侵略協約或排斥暴行之建議、其本身實自相矛盾、夫人有相信應出於自願而擔任義務者、有非者、如人相信應出於自願而擔任義務、則何必再訂此種軍事協定、如對於一國遵守互不侵略義務之誠意、懷有疑慮、則對其忠貞履行此種和平公約中之補充的軍事義務、亦必懷有同樣疑慮矣、如互不侵略之公約仍有發生戰爭之可能、則自衛的與互助的協約亦必有發生侵略行動之可能矣、惟德政府之意、由互不侵略公約而達於逞強破壤和平、其為路之遙、實甚於由自衛的軍事義務而達於攻勢的、德政府在此種歐洲軍事聯盟之志願中、未見其含有集體和平發展之一種因素、更不足言和平之保障矣、故德政府不能簽字於以此種義務為重要部分之公約、公報中又謂近今德元首與英外相西門會談時、曾聲明德國恕不能參加如現式之東歐公約、惟對於以不侵略的相互與一般義務為主旨之集體安全公約、而規定遇有任何簽約者擾亂和平時、則其他簽約國應取會商之手續者、德國準備加以贊同、希特勒並切實聲明判明侵略者之困難、及德政府準備參加不援助此種侵略者之一切計畫、德政府今日仍保持此種態度、當柏林討論之際、希特勒又聲明凡一種公約或建議、其加入者之全體或各個負有多少有限度的自動義務者、德政府概不能接受之、蓋覺此種公約實不含有維持和平之因素也、公報結語謂德國現政府自秉權後、卽表示願與其鄰邦締結互不侵略公約云、（十四日路透電）</p>
<h3>德變態茺之兩面觀</h3>
<p>華沙　德國政府表示願參加東歐互不侵犯公約之消息傳至此間後、一般輿論頗為訝異、金以為德國態度突然改變、其內幕當由德國外交部及國防軍深恐德國處於孤立之所致、至波蘭反對黨方面則認此舉為德國之一種策略、欲藉以衝破列強對德國之圍擊、俾遷延時日、利用時機、以使德國軍備益見擴大云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>德牒副本送達波蘭</h3>
<p>（柏林）外交部長牛賴特昨曾致牒英國大使館、聲明德國願簽訂東歐互不侵略公約、頃外長又以此項牒文抄本、交與波蘭駐德大使李潑斯基、幷就德國觀點補充加以說明、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>蘇聯防德離間手段</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）官塲人士對於德國改變態度一事、（指該國準備簽訂束歐互不侵犯公約）認為「有興趣、却非出乎意外、」以為德國惟知堅強政策是尚、茲因法俄兩國毅然决然成立恊定、乃有此見風使舵之舉、特恐德國此種作法係欲離間愛好和平各國、不可不防耳、此外官塲人士對於英國贊成法俄協定、表示慶幸、對於外傳蘇俄曾向立陶宛有所提議、（指蘇聯要求國加入東歐互助公約而言）一若毫無所知者、但此種提議、並非逸出蘇俄政策範圍、則為一般人所公認、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>小協約為法俄聲援</h3>
<p>捷克京城　德國宣布準備簽訂東歐互不侵犯之後、此間負責人士以為歐洲綏靖事宜、可因此而有切實之進步、惟德國更變態度原因何在、尚無明確消息、無從加以斷定、法國現已準備與蘇聯密切合作、（指法俄行將簽訂協定而言）德國政府改轅易轍之故、或卽在此、亦未可必、此在捷克方面則以為法俄兩國密切合作、實乃維持和平之必要條件云云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英意代表　會外商東匪事　調解委會將在開羅集議</h3>
<p>斯特里薩　意國首相公署外交組主任圭亞爾那希利·英國外交部埃及司司長湯柏森二人、均係斯特里薩會議代表團人員、頃在會議之外、會商菲洲阿比西尼亞事件、所討論者係屬士著部落遷徙問題、此種游牧部落大都携帶武裝、每年必於一定時間、自英屬索謀利倫徙居阿比西尼亞國曁意屬索謀里倫、最易發生糾紛、解决方案屬於專門問題、而與英意阿三國領十十界綫互相牽涉、本日會商之舉、足以引起興趣、其故以此、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>日本現有的空軍與擴充計畫</h3>
<p>日議會閉幕之後、接着就表演迎迓溥儀的喜劇、日本各大新聞都將這當作一件特別重大的事、許多政府人員也為此格外忙碌、我們在異國不同調的人、大感不便、行動都要特別審愼、雖日政府似可藉迎溥之舉、使其人民忘掉一些國內政治上的矛盾、可是日本全國上下、從左到右各黨中的人、以至輿論界大都仍說岡田內閣是「弱體內閣、」而且對牠也大都表示不滿、日本政治上雖有這樣的情形、可是他們對於軍事的整備却非常起勁、師團長會議已於月初召集、主要任務是強化統率權、排斥歐美立憲政治學說、此外、他們對於空軍的擴充、也十分注意、日本現有的空軍勢力、陸軍方面有偵察機十一隊、戰鬥機十一隊、轟炸機四隊、分編成八個聯隊、飛機數約九百架、飛機塲在朝鮮平壤有一個、台灣屛東一個、在日本國內則於所澤·立川·下志津·濱松·各務原·明野·八日市·太刀洗等地、都有飛機塲的設置、這些飛機塲大都有夜間降落的設備、和收藏飛機的格那庫、並且附近還有強固的防空設施、如高射砲陣地、阻塞氣球之類、陸軍飛行學校有四所、所澤是教操縱術的、下志津飛行學校是教偵察的、明野是教戰鬭機的、濱松是教轟炸的、海軍方面以航空母艦為主、現有三十一隊、第二次補充的八隊還未完成、現有飛機約九百架、飛機塲在大凑·霞浦·橫須賀·館山·吳·佐伯·大村·佐世保等處、海軍沒有專設的航空舉校、但在霞浦和橫須賀兩地、有特設的航空訓練班、陸軍有三個飛機工廠、海軍也有三個、現在他們似乎覺着空軍勢力還嫌薄弱、深恐一旦發生戰事、不足以應付強敵、故今年的預算中、有四千八百三十萬元是用於改革陸軍航空的、他們預備添設兩所航空學校、一是陸軍航空技術學校、一是陸軍少年航空學校、添設三個飛行聯隊、一在本島的中部地方、一在朝鮮北部、一在北海道（或北陸地方）、現有的飛機他們都要、逐漸更換新機、其續航力要在二千五百公里以上、他們主要的假想敵不消說是美蘇兩國、總之、日本政治上雖有些不安經濟上也有點不穩定的樣子、但他們對於軍事方面的整備却是十分積極的、（四月四日於東）、</p>

<h3>洋米麥增稅案　財部已令國稅會研究</h3>
<p>大公社云、財政部為防止洋米麥輸華傾銷、影饗民食及農村經濟、疊據各方請求、擬予普遍增加進口稅、業已令飭國定稅則委員會研究、將來呈經行政院通過後、卽訓令海關實行、茲誌各情如下、</p>
<p>普遍增稅</p>
<p>自去年各省市米商及麵粉廠、向西貢等處訂購近遠期洋米六百餘萬包、洋麥三百餘萬包、致市塲人心惶惑、國米受銷路滯呆、價格亦因此低落、影響農村、良非淺鮮、故市府將擬具體防止辦法二項、建議中央核示、前經行政院召集各部會府審查後、僉認事關民食前途、以增稅認非必要、茲復經財部縝密考慮之餘、按諸洋米傾銷情形、以及國內米價問題、須履行增稅辦法、對今後防止洋米大量輸華、方可事半功倍、不分洋米麥之等級優次、决普遍增加進口稅、以示限制、</p>
<p>從長研究</p>
<p>洋米增稅係屬全國民食之重要問題、在未經深籌熟慮之前、不能輕易實施、使進行上致感困難、業已令飭國定稅則委員會從長研究、大公社記者連日向該稅則會及米業團體探悉、中央對洋米之一號·（百分之三十粒碎米）二號·（百分之四十五粒碎米）三號·（百分之六十粒碎米）四號·（全碎米）及坎拿大·澳洲·支加哥·等處洋麥一律不分優次、均擬增加進口稅、每百斤徵·二五海關金單位、（卽每百斤徵稅二角五分）所有過去海關所徵之轉口稅一項、概予豁免、</p>
<p>今後米價</p>
<p>本市米價、自受洋米輪華傾銷以來、國米銷路滯呆、價格亦逐漸降落、影響農村常非淺鮮、兼之本年春熟、因氣候失調、收成大為减退、關心農村經濟復興者頗行焦慮、昨據米業觀察、對米價漲跌、在目前尚未推測、是漲是跌、惟依照歷來慣例、於五月間必有特殊變化、米商營業上成敗、農村經濟有無利害、此時始可斷定、據一般老於經騐之米商、推論本年米價、最高尚須漲至十六元以上、如今年秋熟、再受災害、則農村問題、積重難返、更將不堪收拾也云云、</p>

<p>旅館業自去年徵收航空救國捐以來、因各旅館業熱心愛國、成績極為可觀、惟有少數旅館、不甚努力、航空協會總隊長辦事處、與旅業公會睹此情形、恐長此以往、影響進行、故於本月三日、召開擴大勸募委員會、總隊長辦事處派張裕良出席、議决、定期向兩租界不努力徵收各旅館、擴大勸募、迭誌各報、聞前日該辦事處派幹事李際明、朱聲揚、陸章照、鄒駿程等十餘人、先向公共租界徵收不努力或停收之旅館、如敬勝、海洞春、迎賓、長春、星洲、淸和、九華、一新、天福公、武林、會賓、東海、雲昇、浦江、等旅業勸導促其認眞辦理、努力徵收、若仍敷衍了事、則由總隊長辦事處與族業公會、另定有效辦法對付之、本日仍向公共租界及法租界不努力徵收各旅館勸導云、</p>

<h3>樊仲雲講　怎樣研究國際政治　研究國際政治前的二問題　研究國際政治時的七條件</h3>
<p>中國文化建設協會主辦之全國讀害運動大會特請樊仲雲在中西電臺講「怎樣研究國際政治」原詞如次、</p>
<p>國際政治之認識論</p>
<p>諸君、今天是中國文化建設恊會主辦全國讀書運動大會、特請兄弟演講、怎樣研究國際政治、現在為時問所限、扼要與諸位談談、要研究國際政治、先得明暸什麽叫做國際政治、和為什麽要研究國際政治這兩問題、明白以後、才能談到怎樣研究國際政治、國際政治最簡單之解釋、就是研究各國彼此間政治關係的一種學問、這種學問到近代才有、在昔交通不便、文明未發達、國與國之間的關係、無從發生、國際政治常然談不到、例如中國在中古時代、歐美旣不知有中國、中國亦不知有歐美、關係旣不發生、國際政治當然談不到、現在則不然、無論衣食住行、中國多脫離不了歐美、以煤油一項而論、我國即仰給於外國、共他若金銀風潮之發生、中國均受其禍、在目前各國都形成了世界之一環、世界各國巳形成了一個整個不可分的集團、各國關係之複雜、日甚一日、國際政治、遂益感其研究之重要、以上是國際政治及要研究國際政治之解釋、可謂研究國際政治之認識論、</p>
<p>國際政治之方法論</p>
<p>怎樣研究國際政治、可謂研究國際政治之方法論、研究國際政治之第一條件即近代史之準備、至少是世界以及中國近百年來歷史知識之必須研究淸楚、以世界史而論、第一次世界大戰發生原因、戰前之世界政治、大戰後世界分割之情况、戰勝國與戰收國之善後等情形、均應研究淸楚、不可或忽、須知近代歐洲史表面上似為歐洲開諸國之事、實際上實已支配整個之世界、例如日俄戰爭發生、實由於德相俾斯麥、外交手腕縱橫之所致、俄國之向東方發展、係受俾士麥之慫思、蓋俾斯麥一方面援助俄國、一方面實乃調虎離山之計、德國可以全力應付法國、因日俄之戰、於是遠東各國、尤其是我國受害非淺、故吾人研究國際政治益感迫切、而近代史之準備、更不可忽、第二為經濟常識之準備、在昔以為政治可支配經濟、今則不然、政治絕對受經濟之支配、歐戰後其形勢益顯著、近代歐美國家、均為帝國主義之國家、其所以然者、蓋資本主義之發達最後階段、乃形成帝國主義、其需要者為推銷商品之市塲、政治受經濟之推動、經濟上之種種要求、形成國家政治上種種政策、所以經濟常識之準備是必需要的、而且近代的政治學與往昔之經濟學、絕不相同、以貨幣而論、在昔貨幣之主要條件為信用、為能兌現、今因世界經濟恐慌、購買力薄弱、甚且用通貨膨漲政策、不講信用、不能兌現、以求貨幣之跌價、而推銷其國內之商品、所以經濟學充分準備、亦不可少、第三國際政治之準備、近代各國間、一方面固然殫精竭誠、損人利己、同時休養生息、緩和衝突之尖銳化計也、竭力講求妥恊、所以一方面各國間致力於貨幣之競爭、同時也舉行貨幣會議、請求恊調、所謂國際經濟會議等、均由此發生、要明白認識、則非研究國際公法等不可、第四應有報紙黨派的認識、國際材料之獲得、當然是報章、但報章屢有黨派為背景的、惟其有背景、眞相多不易得、我人必須明瞭其背景、乃可得其本意、上面四點、為研究國際政治方法上的基礎條件、缺一不可云云、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （雲裳）</p>
<p>摩登兩字，在上海已成為一個極普通的名詞，就是作時髦解釋。昨天我偶在一本古色古香的楞嚴經上，也居然發現了摩登兩字，但是它的意義，要是透澈的解釋了出來，我想全上海的女郎，沒有一個情情願願自認為摩登的了。我不妨先把楞嚴經中原文錄下：</p>
<p>楞嚴經載：「釋迦徒弟阿難，遇摩登伽女，攝入淫室，將毀戒體，」注「摩登伽名鉢吉帝，淫女也。」那未阿難旣是佛門弟子，他怎樣會給淫女攝去？也許這個摩登伽女，的確具有特別迷功的淫女。我於是再考阿難究為何佛，佛經釋言為歡喜佛，今北平雍和宮尙藏有歡喜佛一具，歡喜佛與淫女參歡喜禪，這也還是事理之常。佛書又言：「男子稱摩登伽。女子稱摩登祗，」註「淫男淫女也。」唉！照這樣說起來，摩登兩字，確作淫字解釋。上海的一般摩登娘兒們，讀了此文，要不要罵我一聲嚼舌根呢？</p>
<h3>餐英脞語</h3>
<p>— 宛廬</p>
<p>楚騷「餐秋菊之落英」，不過等於美人香草寄慨之辭，不知花中實有數種，可供餐食者：今略舉如次：</p>
<p>菊：味本甘芳，自離騷歌詠之後，慕風雅者，多用為秋筵逸品，「花鍋」之名，由來久矣！菊之色甚繁，惟白者可食，餘均有毒，除菊花鍋外；有以菊瓣調蟹羹者，味尤雋永，然皆不若嶺南菊花糖之妙：其製法，以肥肉一小方，大如棋子，煉以霜糖，敷晒乾之菊瓣於糖上茸然如菊蕊之初舒，嚼之芬芳甘腴，可謂形，色，香，味，皆臻妙境。</p>
<p>玉蘭：玉蘭花瓣，大如蓮瓣，色皎潔而香馥郁，庭前一樹，如聞脂粉之香，摘花瓣之甫舒者，洗去花粉，剪除連蒂之瓣根，（否則味苦）切成寬條，調雞蛋麵粉，霜糖，如糊狀，以花瓣醮糊，入鍋微煎卽食，香甜可口。</p>
<p>夜來香：嶺嶠夜來香，本大如紫籐，初春，抽發嫩苗，並含蓓蕾，摘取其苗，瀹以沸羹，然後入鑊炒之，可以佐餐，香味皆佳，尤爽脆無比！用為冷拌亦佳，內地蒔此花，珍如玉樹，孰忍為此煮鶴焚琴之事？固非粵人，無此豪舉，然亦未始非花之厄運也！</p>
<p>紫籐：初夏，摘其嫩蕊，才現微紫色者：以開水微燙，色立褪，以之煮肉，有微香，若用鷄蛋麵粉，攪成糊狀，敷而炸之，蘸霜糖食之，厥味尤美。</p>
<p>此外如：桂花，玫瑰，可製為糖醬，或漬以霜糖，製為點心之餒，但取其香氣宜人，非眞足快朶頤也。</p>

<h3>徐律師與跳舞</h3>
<p>— 枕綠</p>
<p>去年這時候，春天，徐律師常在晚間到我家來閒談。有一次，大家談到舞塲的盛况，我說：</p>
<p>「現在舞塲開設了許多，營業都不壞，大有與電影院並駕齊驅之勢，可見社會上人閒適和奢靡的態度。我知道你瞧電影是很高興的，徐君，却不知你對於跳舞有怎樣的意見，像你這樣一個多藝好弄的靑年？」</p>
<p>「提起了這，我便不由的氣惱！跳舞塲，還不是一隻張大着虎口？嫖麼，下等的去處有多數人要顧身份不願，或怕梅毒不敢去，長三書寓又是沒有熟人帶挈不能去的；這所在，塲門大開，隨你進去，初時所費不多，漸至迷途難返，不比嫖還便利又普及麼？</p>
<p>「舞女一羣，個個白面紅腮，高鞋跟底，等候着替容人服勞役，——一晚上所跳的步數，可從日昇樓走到高昌廟還不止，却同時踐毀了多少幸福的家庭，多少靑年的前程，——說不定就在這人或那人身上正寄着將來振興國家，造福社會的偉業！</p>
<p>「就瞧那種文明國人視為高尙冠冕的跳舞一事罷，一男一女相擁摟着肉體，做那來來往往遲緩合節的動作，也無異於牀第之間大衆認為不可告人的勾當，竟一對一對地相聚廣衆在大庭之上，公開表演，所差的只這是直站着隔有稀孔眼的衣料罷了！</p>
<p>「那地，那人，那事，有那一點不壞？我曾經朋友强邀去觀光一次，格外證明和加强了我的認識，還有什麼趣味去尋消遣哩！要是我身任地方當局，早已一體查禁了，這跳舞塲！」</p>
<p>今年這時候。又是春天，這經久不來我家的徐律師在一天晚上忽地光臨，相談沒幾句話，便瞧一下他的手錶，不加檢點地說道：</p>
<p>「跳舞塲去麼？八點半正有人等候我在揚子哩！」</p>
<p>「怎樣重大的公事啊？你也跳舞麼？」我問，帶着驚異之色。</p>
<p>「嗄！你還沒有知道，我的跳舞癮很深了呢。每天身坐辦公室，一聽到大晚報嗚聲上下，立刻心煩意亂，游神在燈光明黯，樂聲幽揚，裙屐交錯的所在了！有時一晚上連跑幾處，並不覺得厭倦，若有一晚不去，那便要骨軟筋疲，似攖重疾，又像失掉什麼無價之寳一般了！我一方面仍覺得這是陷人的魔窟，一方面總免不了把這事當作興奮劑看待，這眞是何等離奇的矛盾心理啊，是不是？」他說着，不知不覺地交替顚拍他雙足的皮鞋底，象微着舞塲裏開始搖人心旌的樂鼓聲；接着，他的腰身微微地擺動着，大有聞鷄起舞之意。</p>
<p>原來一個人的意志，可以變更得這樣迅速和相反，誰者不及預科。所以誰也不能担保他本人的一切，就在最近的將來，不到蓋棺時候不止！</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十二回　慚愧沒衣裳垂帷避客辛勤省膏火拂曉抄書</p>
<p>胡嫂子道：你一個大脚的，倒不如小脚的，我不摔倒，你怎麼倒摔倒了呢？浣花道：前面賈老爺等着你吃飯，你偏是弄得這一分樣子，這是怎麼好？你要知道我們渾身雨水淋漓，並不是想圖着什麼，都是為着和你找一條出路，好安身立命。你弄成這個樣子，眞呌我們為難。志前聽他說話帶南方口音，又是這樣的裝束，和人幹這樣的事。也就看出他的為人來了。因笑道：這位大嫂，你說這話，可有有些不能體諒人家。他若是不患瘋病，為什麼好好的要捧到水泥裏面去。這是他自已也不願意的事，你何必怪他？楊浣花向志前瞟了一眼，覺得這人倒也不俗，雖是受了他兩句言語，也不必生氣，因笑道：你先生有所不知，他所剩的就是這身上穿的衣服，現在上下全濕，到那裏去找衣服來換。那還罷了，同人家訂好了的約會，也就去不成了。志前笑道：約會躭誤了不要緊，若不和他換衣服天氣這樣的凉，恐怕會生病，人的皮肉久並不是鐵打的，若是這樣冰冷的泥水，久浸在二位身上，二位怎麼樣呢。他不說這樣的話，倒不要緊，一說過之後，月英哇的一聲、哭了出來。哭的時候，胸脯一起一落，兩隻肩膀，只管扛抬着。志前退了兩步道：姑娘，你爾不是辦法，倒好像是我把話引逗着你哭的了。（一八二）特</p>

<p>沃克斯生於一九五八年三月十二日，他的父親曾在美國南北戰爭中當過軍官，後在諾克斯眞經商，夭克斯幼時僅受過小學教育，因為家寒之故，出了校門，就替諾克斯紀事報送報，十七歲時，進該報館充印刷工人，每星期工資兩元，後服務於路易鎭郵報印刷部，不到一年，改入諾克斯鎭講壇日報排字部，年十九，始和却坦波茄城每日快報發生關係，他服務勤懇，復利用餘暇，讀書自修，所以他在該報館中，從印刷部至總編輯，各部分的職務，都擔任過，次年，他出版了一冊却城行名簿，這是他一生事業成功的起點，年二十五，和神學博士伊薩克的女兒結婚，他倆僅生了一女，後嫁紐約時報公司副總董蘇爾士白傑，他用辦行名簿所盈餘的鐵，賣了却城時報的一半利益，買賣是一千七百五十元，但他只付了現金二百五十元，於是英雄有用武之地，他運用堅若卓絕的意志，努力經營，館中營業，欣欣向榮，兩年後，他用七千五百元買得了其餘一半，不出數年，却城時報就成了一張有勢力的報紙。</p>
<p>一八九六年，沃克斯三十八歲時，他又收買了紐約時報，這時該報在美國各報中，最為腐敗，漸漸歸於消滅，沃克斯買得之後，憑着他的才幹和倌用，把其他有經騐出版家所視為難以應付的問題，都解决了，當時該報財政的薄弱，從他數年後和人談話中可以窺見一斑，他說道：「在我接辦未久，有股票若干份，每元只售一角，其價値之低，可以想見，」他努力經營了三年，紐約時報就能獲利，從此他就成了全館的主腦，向在紐約城日報中營業最微細的報館，經他整頓之後，漸漸發達，營業竟居全城各報之冠，在他改組紐約時報之時，館中職工，只有百餘人，每日銷數不足兩萬份，每年收入毛數約五十萬元，他用辦却城時報的政策，經營紐約時報，所獲的效果，前後相同，他接辦一報，舊有的職員，絕少更動，待人寬厚，所以人人願為出力，白羅克林鷹報著名記者麥克兩博士曾稱讚沃克斯的偉業，說在美國報紙歷史中，實為前所未有。</p>
<p>一九二八年，沃克斯入出版界五十年紀念時，紐約時報的職工，巳增至三千三百餘人，每日銷數在四十萬份以上，星期日刋的銷數，超過七十萬份，每年收入超過二千五百萬元。</p>
<p>若干年來，紐約時報的內容，隨其營業發達而進步，全美各大城都有特別訪員，該報並注重外國新聞，所以在世界各大城都設有辦事處和採訪員，紐約時報在美國日報中第一家用捲筒機印刷圖畫，並且是第一家用無綫電傳遞新聞，館中曾經營許多偉大的事業，尤其注重南北極探險和獎勵航空。</p>
<p>沃克斯辦報的政策，一言以蔽之，是「有益的新聞，無不登載，」他對於廣告和社論，也用這個原則，他一生事業的成功，當然是憑了他的才幹，但起初是得力於「儉勤」兩個字。</p>

<h3>蛋黃素戒烟問題（類脂肪體戒烟問題）</h3>
<p>— 龐京周</p>
<p>向社會人士解說　向醫界同道介紹</p>
<p>（一）引言</p>
<p>自從國府厲行烟禁以來，一般癮君子眞所謂「咸有戒心」，而戒烟新藥蛋黃素恰巧在去冬今春由南京推行到上海，一時社會上談論着蛋黃素，也有贊美的，也有懷疑的，也有排斥的，紛紜錯雜，煞是熱鬧，鄙人對於此種戒烟法略有所知，一天到晚就接得無數電話來問，甚而至於各地同道也來函詢，弄得復不勝復，無聊藥商早已瞎猫拖死老鼠，來一陣投機貿利的勾當，做什麼豆黃素大登廣告，熱心工業的份子已經要想招集股本，製造大批蛋黃素來援救黑籍的同胞，寖寖乎有潮水般的氣勢，因此醫界中有人將蛋黃素戒烟比作去年媒油治肺的風潮一般，呌牠作蛋黃潮，然而蛋黃素戒烟却比不得煤油治肺那麼荒唐，發明的人自有他的研究工作，蛋黃素本身原有牠藥物上的立塲，用以戒烟也有醫學上的理論，衛生署貿然出售蛋黃素，也憑着他試騐的成續，我如今把蛋黃素戒鴉片的來踪去跡，叙述一番，好讓社會人士黑籍先生鎭定明暸，而醫界同道也可以作進一步的探討，本來凡是醫藥問題的進步，都不是一蹴卽幾，萬不可起勁的時候，一窩蜂嚷着，而未後就泳消瓦解了。</p>
<p>（二）蛋黃素是什麽東西？</p>
<p>蛋黃素原名呌作Lecithin學上是一種有機物質，屬於類脂肪體，蛋黃裏面含量最多，原名首半個字照西洋古文講，就是蛋字的意思，中華審定化學名詞也譯為蛋黃素，其他動植物體內含有蛋黃素多少不等，黃豆裏面比較含得很豐富，所以從黃豆中提煉不純粹的蛋黃素，比蛋中去提要經濟些，蛋黃素化學程式是C44H90NPO9，因為內中含有燐質，所以平常醫家用作補身健腦之劑，也曾有一部份醫家對於肺癆病用作類脂肪質刺激療法的注射劑，但所需用量極微，此外工業上用品就是極粗製的了。</p>
<p>總之此藥由來已久，並非去冬今春突然發明特殊產生的。</p>
<p>（三）為什麽用蛋黃素戒起烟來</p>
<p>蛋黃素應用到戒烟的起因，還是在民國二十年，當時馬文昭醫師在北平研究生理化學，發見了嗎啡中毒與動物體內組織中某項變化的影響，才繼續向這一方面去進行，馬君初次試騐的報告原文是英文，發表在中華生理學會一九三一年所出的生理雜誌第五卷第三期，自第二五一頁起並有譯成中文的簡要題目呌作「白鼠於患急性與慢性嗎啡症時細胞中之變態」，如今我再將馬君的原著大要很簡略的寫在下面，以符本篇通俗之旨，至於同道要詳細研究請查原書罷。</p>
<p>馬君用兩組白鼠數十頭，分別注射嗎啡不同量，造成白展急慢性嗎啡中毒，又在不同的時間內，逐步殺死鼠一頭，以供試騐，結果發見興奮期間各種器管內的高基氏器增多，（京按高基氏器原名GolgiApparat為高基氏用一種染色法所發見，又短枝的Ganglienzlle等，亦為高民所發見，高氏生於一八四四年，歿於一九二六年，所以高基氏器在醫學史上也不是很新鮮的頑意兒，）反之在白鼠頹靡時期則减少，因此馬君提出結論，謂嗎啡之作用隨體中高基氏器之多少為轉移，而又適與表面上興奮與頹靡的症象相為表裏，夫高基氏器為類脂質，而類脂質最要者又是蛋黃素，那麼假定（甲）飼食蛋黃素能否增加高基氏器？（乙）於犯癮期中眼見高基氏器漸漸消失，能否因蛋黃素之補充而使高基氏不消失，因而免却頹靡之象？經試飼結果以上兩個問題皆能得到圓滿的答案，於是馬君根據這種成績，作為蛋黃素戒鴉片癮的張本。</p>
<p>總之蛋黃素戒烟的來歷是起源於三年以前，不是去年才發明，也經過了正當的動物試騐，並應有的步驟，不是胡亂嘗試，也不是偶然成功，至於馬君為什麼作此試騐，也有已往的「鴉片中毒病理」的文獻為綫索，不是心生一計忽忽而告成的。</p>
<p>（四）蛋黃素戒烟法試用到人體是幾時了？</p>
<p>自從馬君作了初步試騐，就進行第二步工作，研究嗎啡慢性中毒後血液中的變化，他將患嗎啡病的病人白血球來試騐，蹬明與白鼠中所得結果相同，（文載中華醫學雜誌四十六卷）其次馬君再試騐有核細胞—紅血球與血小板等，結果扼要如下：</p>
<p>（甲）在犯癮之初，紅血球增多，而中性紅染體增大（Neutrophil）血小板稍减</p>
<p>（乙）在過癮時，（卽受足嗎啡時）紅血球之數及中性紅染體皆減少，而血小板則增加一倍至二倍以上。</p>
<p>（丙）在犯癮之後，紅血球與血小板着色略淡，狀似衰化，數目則紅血球先减後增，血小板始終减少。</p>
<p>試騐結果，此項血中之不正常變化，亦可用飼食蛋黃素而矯正之，此文載在中華生理學雜誌一九三二年第六卷第四期三五九至三九〇頁，題為「白鼠於長期注射嗎啡及時治療後其紅血球及血小板之改變」。</p>
<p>在這時候，馬君一方面試騐動物，一方面已經將蛋黃素應用到人體，是在民國二十年六月二日至七月三十日在南京中央禁烟委員會戒烟醫院內實行，該院設有病床四十三具，看護醫師數人，馬君共試用蛋黃素戒烟法於一五一人，分作四組，那是候他的用法是一面給病人以代用品（鴉片丁幾），而一面再給以蛋黃素丸藥，而蛋黃素的分量，不過目今用的分址三分之一或四分之一，成績居然很好，內中有一個八十五歲的老叟，因腹痛上癮，已吸了四十一年烟，也不過吃十四天代用品，住院二十一天，而戒絕出院了，關於此項報告，馬君曾有詳文登載在中華醫學雜誌英文本一九三二年四十六卷題目是TheEffectofLecithinonOpiumAddicte(ReportoftheWorkDoneintheAntiopiumHospitaloftheNationalOpiumSuppressionCommissoninNanking）</p>
<p>譯意是「蛋黃素對於鴉片癮之功效（南京中央禁烟委員會戒姻醫院工作報告）」（未完）</p>
<h3>各國學校口腔衛生過去史略（二）</h3>
<p>— 司徒學</p>
<p>所謂實騐學級者，乃由該校之第四年級至第八年級之學童中，選定口腔狀態最不良者四十名，實行完全齒科治療，同時並與各家庭協定，須使該學童嚴守口腔衛生。此實騐學級自一九一〇年五月十八日開始，至翌年五月止，在此期間，依一定之規則，努力於該學童之齒牙治療，與其日常生活之改善，並受專門家之六次心理學試騐，以調查學童進步之實况。最初Ebensol氏之推測，以為至多不過增加五十％，及至最後實騐之結果，竟超出豫期以上，而增加九九·八％之成績。因此自實騐學級之後，學校齒科之普及運動，迅速開展，幾擴於全美，遂有創立全美口腔衛生協會TheNationalMouthHygieneAssociation之動機，在一九一一年七月成立</p>
<p>美國之市立學校齒科治療所創辦最早者，為Philadelphea市，該市於一九一〇年由市費設立，該所之執務人員，乃由該市開業齒科醫中之二百十人參加報效者，此篤志團體，稱為ThePhiladelpheaDentalDispensaryCorpso</p>
<p>一九一三年紐約州開始設置州口腔衛生官，（StateMouthHygieneInspector）其後Massachusetts州以下，約七八州，均有設置，專為監督州內口腔衛生事業，及指導小學校敎職員之口腔衛生常識者也。</p>
<p>口腔衛生手，為齒科醫之助手，專為助理兒童口腔衛生上一切事項，為學校齒科治療之預防工作上所不可缺少者也。此種人材，均由口腔衛生手學校所養成。此種學校，創於一九一三年秋，Forsyht氏於BridgePort市開始創辦。約經兩年，而Massachusetts州Conneoticut州等亦由州法公布，特許採用法規。其次紐約州Pennsylvania及California等三十餘州，亦規定特許公布。一其敎育機關，多設於各大學或病院內，以培植此種人材。</p>
<p>美國齒科醫學會，TheAmericanDentalAssociation有口腔衛生敎育部之設施，（一九二四年）與各州之齒科醫學會共同努力，作盛大之活動，由口腔衛生手出身之MissESchmidt為主任，實為斯界之才媛也。</p>
<p>美國過去之學校口腔衛生運動，已如前述。近十年來，貢獻最偉大之功績者，當推BridgePort市之Forsyth氏，不但其創辦口腔衛生手之功績，見稱於時，且於一九一四年為該市之齒科主任以來，創設更為合理化之學校齒科，嘗發表其成續，全美口腔衛生界，無不佩服氏之熱忱也。</p>

<h3>止痛的醫學（十）</h3>
<p>— 李興</p>
<p>氣痛　氣痛是少數人有的。常有氣痛也是很討厭的。氣痛雖不能痛死人但也呌人很難過。氣痛最平常的原因是大便閉結。每日有大便的很少有氣痛。有的人每十天或兩禮拜大便一次，有氣痛當然不是意外的。其次肝硬化大腸慢性發炎也是氣痛的原因。吸食鴉片與注射嗎啡使腸蠕動停滯致多氣痛。</p>
<p>止氣痛的方法很簡單祇要注意不要大便閉結便可。除戒鴉片嗎啡也是根本辦法。其次熱濕墊敷腹與灌腸也有相當的價値。食物宜减去難消化類。</p>
<p>梅毒危象（LueticCrises）　老梅毒卽梅毒第三期，每於梅毒初起後十五年或二十年後發生一種猛烈的痛名為「梅毒危象」。其疼痛的原因係由於梅毒虫破壞後脊腦與後脊腦腺的作用。這樣人所講腹痛，腿痛等實際上痛並不在腹部也不在腿部，不過是由於脊腦的反應作用。最平常痛起於腿部，起初痛尙輕，但漸久漸重，最後達到極點。病者常形容這種痛是和火燒，呀咬或刀刺相似。這種痛就好像一把燒紅的尖刀刺入肉內再扭轉來扭轉去一樣。這種痛臨身也急如閃電，痛歷數小時之久，經過短時間平靜，痛就重來。有時這種痛，時有時無，歷多年之久。也有一種痛呌做「束腰痛」卽痛圍腰周圈或圍胸周圈。與痛同來的也常有多種異常的感覺，如麻木，酸痛，異常冷覺，異常熱覺，麻刺等。痛極猛烈時以手按痛處有時可以止痛，有時可以使痛加甚。</p>
<p>內臟危象與以上危象相彷彿，不過痛覺到在腹部。痛來時忽然臨身勢如刀刺，嘔吐也隨之發作。痛去後病者一如常人。痛如此時發時止歷時久暫不等。</p>
<p>治療這種痛以麻醉品臨時止痛可以算是救急的辦法，例如，由醫師注射嗎啡？根本的辦法還是必須用治療梅毒的方法。如曾於十年或二十年前有過梅毒者遇見類似這種的痛不可不想到或者是梅毒遺留下的禍。</p>
<p>異位小產　異位小產是婦女的一種危險症。異位小產的意義卽一種小產不發生在平當的地位。平常小產發生在子宮內。異位小產常發生在輸卵管內，（輸卵管由子宮兩角通入小腹內，每管大如鉛筆。）輸卵管的功用卽輸女卵到子宮內。女卵與男精蟲相結合卽成胎。懷胎的正當地位是在子宮內。但有時不按這種規則，精蟲與卵在輸卵管內相遇而成胎，胎卽生長在輸卵管內。因為輸卵管的功用不是為長胎，故胎漸長大到兩三個月，這輸卵管便忽然破裂流血，同時就發生猛烈的痛。</p>
<p>由這種小產流血，很强壯的人於數十分鐘內就無血色。由這種特別的痛與短時間成顯著的貧血可知是異位小產。</p>
<p>這又是一種「緊急腹病」。單止痛不是正當辦法。當立時施行外科手術將破裂輸卵管與胎割去，止住流血後施行外科普通止痛方法。</p>
<p>經痛　經痛是婦女一種平常的毛病。經痛有好幾種原因，知道了原因才能有合宜的止痛方法。若是不知道原因去治療當然不能得到好的效騐。現在略講講經痛的原因：第一種的原因就是神經性痛，卽卵巢腺或子宮等部神經痛隨月經而來。第二種原因是小腹內發炎，月經來時子宮脹大故疼痛轉劇烈。第三種原因是由於子宮道受阻塞。阻塞，如由子宮頸道發炎後縮小致月經排洩汁不易流出，或由子宮內膜腫脹，或由於子宮位置不正，或由於子宮頸部生瘤，第四處原因是子宮內生膜，每當月經排出膜時發生劇烈的痛。（未完）</p>
<h3>肺結核淺說</h3>
<p>第十章　肺結核症的預後</p>
<p>肺部的病灶性質，和預後方面的關係是很大的；此中滲出性和增生性的分別，前面已經好幾次提過了！預後情形優良的，有肺尖結核，硬變性結核，散在性的小病灶也不很嚴重。滲出性中的乾酪性肺炎一型式，是著名嚴重異常的，就是氣管枝肺炎性型式，如果溫度很高，也是一樣的，這都是預後惡劣的。介於此二者之間的，像擴大的增生性結核，就是一個顯例，他的預後並不甚惡劣，也並非優良；但如果有了合并症的話，那是屬諸例外的。</p>
<p>病灶面積的大小。和預後方面的優劣，是有密切關係的。大慨面積僉大，預後情形愈不良：如果係發生空洞了，那末，症勢自比較嚴重，預後也不佳，差不多在五年左右，十之六七係免不了死亡的。這也算一個很驚人的紀錄了！但早期浸潤的空洞是屬諸例外的；此外，患者施行正當治療之與否，對於病症的轉移，關係也是很大的。</p>
<p>臨床上的重要症象，像溫度的高低，痰中結核菌的有無，血液檢查的情形，以及血球升降之遲速，和預後，關係都是非常密切的。此外，患本病者如兼有糖尿病梅毒等病症，或且係發生腦膜炎喉結核賜結核等合併症了，預後的情形大半是不良的。</p>
<p>患本病者，卽使他的病在變化，呈靜止狀態已經有數月或年餘之久；祗須偶患流行感冒症口峽炎等症，或因過度的勞力、都足以使彼一朝重行爆發，而變為進行性。至於另外的急性傳染病，那當然可據此而推想了（未完）</p>
<h3>耳鼻喉眼衛生常識</h3>
<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（四十三）耳漏</p>
<p>耳漏就是俗間稱為爛耳的一個病症。在醫學上說起來。凡是從中耳分泌一種帶漿液性，粘液性，膿性，或血性的分泌物。都可稱為耳漏，小兒患着這種病症的很多。父母携兒童求診於耳科醫師的主要原因。也是多半為着兒童有了耳漏的綠故。因為兒童得着耳漏的機會特多。醫如在麻疹，猩紅熱，感冒，氣管炎，肺炎等時候。常能引起中耳炎。由中耳炎的病變。屢可釀成耳漏的一個結果。這種結果，我們千萬不可忽視。因為耳漏輕則可以聾耳。重則可以致命。他所以致命的原因。就是由耳漏繼發的腦膜炎或腦膿瘍。這種腦膜炎及腦膿瘍。在醫學上特稱為耳性腦膜炎及耳性腦膿瘍。她們所發生的病象。與普通的腦膜炎及腦膿瘍。完全相似。所不同的。就是她們是由耳漏的病原而誘發的。但是講到危險的兩個字。那是一樣的。可惜一般人對於耳漏。素不注意。以為耳漏是不要緊的。往往任其自然。或者沛入金絲荷葉，葱蒜等植物。或者吹入冰片等粉末。這等治法。均足引起劇烈的化膿。是有損無益的。有的時候。竟當它是一種耳內的濕氣。有意不治。以為治了。可以誘起內病。有的時候。父母以為耳漏的原因。是由小兒啼哭時。眼淚誤入耳內所致。這種的誤解。在現今醫學昌盛提倡衛生的時期。是不應當再有的。還有許多病家。口頭或書面問我「由耳漏而來的耳聾，可先治好耳聾麼？」。這一個問題。是很簡單而又容易答覆的。就是第一要先醫治耳漏。耳漏旣愈。再治耳聾。方可有效。否則不求根本。萬難見效啊。</p>

<h3>日本對外貿易之出路</h3>
<p>— 王雨桐</p>
<p>日本與更北之經濟關係</p>
<p>自九一八瀋變迄今，中日就過去之關係論，可謂惡劣萬分。乃者日本方面盛傳有中日經濟提携之說，高唱入雲，愈逼愈眞。最近在滬召集之日本駐華領事會議，亦已閉幕，日使並有不日回國報告之脫，其所議之內容如何，不可得知，但所謂「經濟提携」，必為其主要之議案也。</p>
<p>欲言經濟提携，必也兩國在經濟上互有勻整之發展，無片面之强迫性質，而深感各有切實合作，彼此輔助之必要，始可以言經濟的互惠，而得提携之實。顧我國近年以災祲交迫，農村破產，都市則工商凋零，經濟惡劣，方自謀補救之不遑，何暇他驚旁求，更何暇為他人謀。且按之已往我國對外經濟關係，祗知有侵峪與被侵略關係之存在，乃空谷足音，忽有所謂中日經濟提携之說，豈東鄰好友，眞欲加厚愛於我耶？是不得不有以研討之。</p>
<p>緣日本整個經濟之生存，完全建築於出口貿易事業之上。自九一八事變傀儡組織告成以後，日本滿以為今後之東北市塲，行將成為日本商品為所欲為之獨占市場：臥榻之側，决不容他人之酣睡。然天下事固有未可意料者。東北自被日本强佔後，經濟情形，日趨下落，素以特產著稱之大豆，受世界經濟恐慌之影響，使大豆之消費减退，出口隨之激减。大豆豆油之外銷，大都輸往歐洲，而以德國約占出口總額百分之七十：豆餅大都輸向日本，但近以德國油脂工業不振，及日本農業之衰頽，均足阻滯其輸出。更就東北之全體貿易以觀，自一九三三年始，已由出超地位轉為入超地位，彼日人之所謂「滿洲景氣」者，實皆自日本移入之景氣耳。蓋自偽組織成立後，日本資金遂巨量流入，從事各種事業之投資活動，東北經濟界一時呈異常活躍之氣象。然終以東北市塲自身之消化力薄弱，大量之日本商品，雖低廉傾銷，而迄不能塡補日本企業家之慾壑。故現時日本商品在東北市塲，除靜待東北特產貿易狀况之恢復外，巳無其他出路，此日本經濟界所謂「盡人事以待天命一者也，　　日本商品與世界市塲</p>
<p>更就世界市場與日貨之關係言之，自一九三三年以來，世界貿易之顯著的減退傾向，雖稍見緩和，計是年之世界輸出總額，據國際聯盟所調查，為美金一百零七憶八千九百萬元，然以此數較之一九二九年，在輸出價額上尙不足百分之三十五，而數量上亦不過百分之七十五，是事實上世界貿易，仍顯示萎靡不振之狀態也。</p>
<p>處此四周不景氣環境中，獨日本對外貿易能活躍萬分，遠駕各國之上，計一九三三年日本之輸出數量，較一九二八年激增至百分之一四四·八，以是頓使日本商品有席捲世界市塲之勢，各國均為之側目不安。蓋日本商品輸出增進之最大原動力，劂為滙率低落，與成本輕微耳，考成本之輕微，雖由於實質工資低廉之故，然其大部分因近年日本產業發達，生產能率隨之增大。至滙率低落之有利於貿易方面考極大，尤以對於荷蘭·法國·意大利·等金本位維持國家及其殖民地，更足為日本商品向外傾銷之區域。惟據普通之經濟原理言，滙率低落，足以誘致商品之價格騰貴，復影響及於國內之生產品，工資·薪給·地租·及其他之價格，結果應得之於此者，將失之於彼。然就日本之現狀而覜，其滙率低落之利益，决不致被他種因素相消殺。何以言之？蓋日本國內除仰求於輸入之小部分原料品以外，其他物品之成本並無增大。例如日本之農村，現方處於衰敝時期，農產品價格，無由昂責。失業考衆多，一般之工資及薪給，亦無從增加。更有一點應注意者，即匯率低落，對於口本之貿易平衝上，齊效頗大也。</p>
<p>觀於上述各點，可知日本商品能獨步世界市塲者，良非無故，試就其實績觀之，日本商品在英殖民地如印度，澳州，海峽殖民地，東非洲，新西蘭，等處之輸出，在一九三一年為日金二億八千七百八十萬元，迨一九三三年度，一躍而達四億八千四百三十萬元，其他如荷屬東印度，中美洲，南美洲，各地，無不成為日貨秦凱之市塲。然自一九三三年倫敦世界經濟會議失敗以後，各國乃競採保護貿易政策，以圖確保本國生產者之國內市塲，對外則重在採用關稅防護手段，輔以限制輸入及禁止輸人之絕對的方法，以抵制外來之經濟勢力。經濟鎖國主義，自此益形深刻。於是所謂關稅戰爭，貿易管理，滙兌管理等經濟政策，皆先後應時崛起。而跋扈飛揚無孔不入之日本商品，遂不得不首當其衡，到處遭受強力之排擊。誠以各國為保護本身之產業計，不能與低工資，低滙兌及成本輕微之日貨相爭於市場，乃有得不出以排擠之一法。如英美德法意瑞士等國家或提高關稅，實行輸入比率制，或則管理滙兌，徵收日貨之傾銷稅，頓令日本商品在世界市塲，已受四面楚歌之苦，乃有亟謀另關出路之必要矣。</p>
<p>日本商品之出路</p>
<p>日本商品在國際市場上之情勢，旣經變化，於是中國市場遂為其轉移目標之良好出路。去夏不佞漫遊日本各地時，彼邦經濟界已一致發出所謂「中國市場價値之再認識」之呼聲，朝野上下均附而和之。去年三月，日本之日華實業協會等主要對華貿易機關，對於中日經濟提携運動，唱導不遺餘力。年來日本於我華北方面之舉動，已見諸事實者，為通車，通郵，設關等：其巳經宣傳及在計劃中者，有通航，貨物聯運，建設熱河北平間鐵路，開闢北平為商埠，及塘沽築港等，均由關東軍總其成。是其欲待政治的及經濟的獲完滿之根本解决，庶中國之門戶，完全為其所封鎖，中國之市塲完全為其所獨占。今茲之所謂中日經濟提携運動，果令實現，則長江流域一帶，日本必將重建其經濟勢力，庶南北連絡呼應，自此不特中國自身固有之一綫經濟生機為之消滅殆盡，即各帝國中義者之在華經濟勢力，亦將被逐出於千里以外也。</p>
<h3>日本對華投資之分析</h3>
<p>— 譚秉文</p>
<p>中日提携的呼聲日高，列强們看見，免不了眼紅。尤其是英美。因為一則在投資關係上佔首席，一則在貿易方面坐第一把交椅，在此緊要關頭，一定要有些表示，這便是最近醞釀的英美共同借欵，跟踵中日提携論發生的道理。性急的沙遜爵士，更預先等到刻借欵的技術，貿然發表他的宏論。可是天機不可拽漏，結果碰了一鼻子灰，祗得自認悔氣。不過仍在逐鹿之秋，將來鹿死誰手，不去管他，但就各國的對華投資關係—尤其是日本的對華投資關係，加以一番檢討。</p>
<p>要研究將來之列國對華借欵，不得不追溯到一九一零年的舊借欵團。當一九零零年義和團之役後，各國對華貸欵，競爭甚劇。於是由英法德美四國組織銀團，成立六百萬鎊的湖廣鐵路借欵。翌年「四國銀團」又擬成立改革幣制和振興實業的大借欵一千萬鎊，而為日俄所反對，便躭擱起來。袁項城看透了當時列强的心理，便在一九一二年進行交涉善後借欵，邀請日俄兩國參加，共同組織「六國銀團」。驕傲的沙姆大叔，知道了大不為然，毅然退出，而又功敗垂成。一直等到歐洲大戰，各國自顧不暇，日本和美國便乘機而入，欲以種種實業借欵為名，壟斷了中國投資市塲。最値得注意的，是日本寺內內閣時期（一九一六至一九一八年）成功的西原大借欵，其額達一僮二千萬日圓之鉅。戰事結束，美國即主倡組織英美法日新銀團，意在打破日人之壟斷，要使這個新銀團，成為中國唯一的債主，並且牠有權力過問一切旣存的借欵和交涉中的借欵（無論是政治借欵抑實業借欵）可惜至今似已失了時效。及經過了一九二二年的九國公約，單獨借欵是不可能了。故雖有一九三三年的美國棉麥借欵，因為純係經濟性質，故屬例外，但聞事前疏通奔走，煞費了一番苦心！</p>
<p>就目前中國政府債務額看來，外債總額約五億八千六百萬美元，其中日本佔三八·二％，英國三六·一％屈居次席，法國為一六·六％，美國祇有七·一％，德國則為七·一％。如異講到投資總額，情形又稍有不同：英國為十一億八千九百萬美元，日本五億八千六百萬美元，美國一憶六百萬美元，（上面的數字比率，都是根據日本國際經濟週報第十六卷十二號七一〇頁的記載，）美國在投資方面雖然還沒有佔一個十分重要的位置，然而在貿易方面却站在領袖的地位，其勢是不可以輕視。有占着持殊地位的英美，自然不喜勸中國單獨與日本「提携」，如果有好處，他們也要染指！</p>
<p>我們不要忘記，本文重在日本對華投資的檢討。日本對華投資的歷史很短，在二十世紀之初，祇佔我國債務總額之〇·一％（根據上揭刊物。）後來義和團事件發生，庚子賠欵，日本也得嘗一彎。漸漸地時橫又來了，一九零八年漢冶萍公司正憂沒有錢，於是日本的正金銀行，便利用鉅大的存欵，向這方投放，一九零九年的南滿鐵路借欵又告成功，以後日對華投資，其進步實可　人。在大戰前，日本對華投次，可以說是拿東三省做中心，戰後地域開拓，漸入中國「本部」，在這加速度的進展過程中，日本投資竟佔着首席。等到東三省事件的前夕（一九三零年底），日本的對華投資，其在中國本部，足與東三省的投資等量齊觀。據Rener氏EoreignInvestmentChina所載，當時日本對「滿」投資額為十一億圓，「滿上洲」以外則為十一意七千三百圓，眞是後來居了。現在「滿洲」事實上已成了日本的附庸，一任牠怎樣宰割，經濟的特模當然更給牠一手壟斷，就是「滿洲」以外各省，日本的經濟勢力，也日在明滋暗長，—尤其是華北和長江流城一帶。不慣於未雨綢繆的我國人土，不知作何感想？下面是日本新聞聯合社的調查，表示最近日本對華（東三省除外）投資的數字：（單位千日圓）</p>
<p>（A）直接事業投資</p>
<p>運輸業　二〇、一二五　銀行及金融業　六五、〇四六</p>
<p>鑛業　九、七　進出口貿易業二四八、一六九</p>
<p>其他　七二、一〇五　製造業　二三二、六九七</p>
<p>總計　六四七、八五九</p>
<p>（B）中國公司團體之貸欵</p>
<p>漢冶萍四〇、〇〇〇即南潯鐵路一〇、七三火紡織業　七、九八八　地方公益一八、七〇〇總　計七七、四二七</p>
<p>（C）中國政府之貸欵</p>
<p>有担保借欵　四五、四六九　究無祖保借欵二〇〇、〇八七</p>
<p>鐵道以外交通事業債務　三五、四三三　計　四四八、一五五</p>
<p>鐵道債務　一六七、一六四　總計　一、一七三、四四一</p>
<p>直接投資，就是以日本資本而在中國境內興辦工商業。從上面我們看到：直接投資的數額，要佔債權總額一半以上。這是因為有着領事裁判權的關係，外商乘便就地設廠，又無須繳納營業稅，所以每年的利益很可觀。利用我們的原料，剝削我們的勞工，再製成貨品換取我們的金錢，這是多麼巧妙的手段呵！日本和我們僅隔一衣帶水，對於我國的人文地理如數家珍，所以日商廠家特別發達。最近廣東政府擬征收外商營業稅，大胆的外商，竟敢拒絕，現在還在那裏糾纏不淸呢！日本直接經營工商業所投下的資本那麼多，他國當然也不肯示弱，那末，在各具特殊權利的外商競爭之下，幼稺的我國工業，那裏有發達的希望？這般喧賓奪主的外國工商界，如果我們不想補救辦法，不知道還要跋扈到什麼地步呢！</p>
<p>其次値得注意的，便是日本對華交通事業的投資之下觀。據上表，鐵路債務及其他交通債務額，竟達二萬萬元以上。俄國烏利亞諾夫說得好：「交通系統之於一國，譬猶血脈之於人身」。他的信徒們在兩次五年計劃中，便拚命的發展交通事業，血液暢通，然後身體强健可期。廻觀我國，交通事業在名裏上雖是我人所有，在事實上却另有「老闆」後面。學債太多了，還債的能力不免薄弱。。何况所舉的債，儘有許多不明不白，即使有力還債，亦無從戃起，據日本方面所統計，竟有利息超過本金的也不少。列表如左：</p>

<h3>汕頭通貨制度崩潰之研討</h3>
<p>— 鄧邦傑</p>
<p>（續一百十八期）</p>
<p>（四）評議</p>
<p>（一）通貨膨脤派主張之評議查普通商店之能以小額資本營鉅額交易者，全在乎資金週轉（Turnover）之靈敏。今有甲商號於此，其資本金為十萬元，每月交易達八萬元，假定半月進貨一次，則年中資金週轉可得二十四次，共營交易一百九十二萬元。若一月進貨一次，則年中資金週轉十二次，共營交易九十六萬元。以十萬元之資本，營九十六萬至一百九十二萬元之交易，其資金無形中不啻增加八·六倍至一八·一一倍焉。令融市塲之現象亦如此。若通貨運轉靈敏，挹彼注此，籌碼無形中亦自能大事增加，苟非實屬萬分支絀，又有何不足之感哉</p>
<p>汕頭通貨之短絀，固為不能諱言之事實，而一究其內容，則其短短絀之程度，尙不如，一般感覺之甚。查一般所以感覺通貨短絀者不外出於二端：</p>
<p>（一）因工商業尙無運用商業票據之習慣，金融市塲無靈活之信用工具，以助調撥，資金陷於呆滯，有餘不足難以調劑，有餓者固有資金無所用之苦，而不足者自有通貨支絀之感矣，此其一。</p>
<p>（一）因年來金融恐慌之結果，一般存戶俱視銀莊存欵為畏途，現金窖藏不出，而銀業方面，放欵亦日趨審愼，對於信用稍遜之中下級商號，不敢輕率貸欵救濟，而信用良好之上級商號，則無需乎銀業之貸欵。銀業資金無所用之，屯積日厚，而中下級商號則呼癸呼庚，籲欵無門，自有通貨支絀之感矣。年來日息之明鬆暗緊，則為此等事實有力的證明，此其二。</p>
<p>綜此二端，通貨支絀感覺之由來已甚朋，而通貨支紐之為一時幻象亦至顯者。處今而言救濟之道，自當以流通資金為急務。若仍以澎賑通貨為能事，不特如隔靴搔癢，未能搔着癢處，即有微效，亦屬頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚，未足以言效。昔者漢興承秦之敝，令民鑄錢，及錢多而民益困，其弊坐在增加通貨而不謀流通通貨，主張通貨膨脹者可以鑒諸！</p>
<p>且也，膨脤通貨不特無補於事功，且有損於金融，因幣額加增，幣値跌落，將致紙幣信用之澈底喪失，加速整個金融市塲之崩毀也。縱令行之而無害，然因其不能過阻金融之恐慌，（河以年來之事實為證）施行通貨膨脹政策後恐慌必將陸續而來，則通貨膨張政策亦將不斷施行乎？竊恐市民對於銀業之信任寖微寖滅，終必有不能行之一日。是時通貨洪流淹沒百業，為害之慘，不可勝言。即從社會全體福利言之，通貨膨脹，物價必漲，靠升斗為活者，將有凍餒之變；資產階級，則為地價房租之增高，可坐享不當之利得。去年五六月間，商庫證發行有期之消息傳出後，汕市地皮實漲價二三成，其中固難免有抬高地價以冀多抵發商庫證者，然其受通貨膨脹之影響，則毫無疑義，可見地產商欲發流通券，完全為其私利計，尙加深大衆之困苦，事之不尤，孰逾於此。</p>
<p>（二）總兌換政策與通貨收縮政策之批評查各國銀行法，對於紙幣之發行，莫不先得政府之特許，其採單一發行制者，固無論已，即採多數發行制者，亦皆有此限制。獨汕市之發行制度則不然，其保證紙幣，白票，輔助券，流通券，保證單，等之發行，從未經政府之特許，而惟以市商會保證為已足。即有濫發，市民不敢究詰，官廳亦無從查考。再依照我國銀行法規定：銀行發行紙幣，須有六成現金準備，四成保證準備，而無產業（如地產等）作準備，（上海地產商正在要求保證準備中，許以地產道契之類作一成準備，尙未核准。）揆立法之意，蓋以產業之價格變動絕頻，一漲一落又常懸絕，巨險之來，轉變現金又綦難，不適於作紙幣準備之用，宜也。乃汕市之保證紙，則全以產業為準備，是不啻植基於火山之口，隨時有燬滅之虞。丁市面繁榮之日，地價常趨漲勢，紙幣價値尙得保持，若一旦不景氣襲來，地價立即低跌，紙幣價値自必隨之而跌，拒收擠兌之巨潮，層出不已，金融市塲將無寗日矣。例如汕頭外馬路某酒店之地價，在昔購人時，每井達三百元，今則貶價三四十元，亦無人過問矣。如以此等產業作準備，恐即變欵亦僅及發行額三四成！縱地產之價格一成不變，而其估値從過去事實證明，未見其能一秉大公，以少估多之弊，所在多有，且聞在估定後私以賤業抽調者，黑幕重重，更難究請。在昔之以地產作保證者，原謂可以化呆滯之資金，為活動之資本，業主市塲互蒙其利，孰料其流弊一至於此，保證紙幣信用之失隕又安足怪。今日縱施行任何維持信用之政策，若不先拔除所以致信用失墮之癥結，將徒見其勞而無功，即有微效，亦為一時之現象，吾無取焉。</p>
<p>鄙意及今而言根本救濟汕頭金融，撮其運者，約有兩端。。</p>
<p>（一）欲求通貨之無乏，當先謀通貨運用之圓滑；而欲謀通貨運用之圓滑，除銀業應盡量貸款濟中下級商號，以免通貨膠滯外，更當推廣商業票據之運用；而欲推廣商業票據之運用，則又在信用制度之建立！新式金融市塲之奠基。此則有待於銀業自身之努力者也。</p>
<p>（二）欲免除保證紙拒收鬧兌等巨潮，當先謀保證紙信用之維持；而欲謀保證紙信用之維持，當自廢險舊日發行制度始，而尤以產業保證制度為宜澈底廢除。嗣後銀業發行紙幣當先取得政府之允許，並須備足六成現金準備，三成保證準備，地產準備至多只可佔十分之二，此則有待於政府之監督者也。</p>
<p>誠能如是，汕頭金融，或有穩定之望矣。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>論通俗文學</h3>
<p>— 張香山</p>
<p>以表面的現象來觀察，現代文學似乎可以分成通俗文學與純文學的二大洪流，在今日，通俗文學無論在量或質上，都絕對地壓倒了一概的純文學，尤其在商業市塲上，更顯示了卓越的活躍。</p>
<p>通俗文學與純文學的分別，似乎頗難晰明，尤其在今日的歐美文壇上的出現的通俗文學，與日本及我國的通俗文學，在質上就有了極顯明的差別，因着經濟組織的不同，通俗文學的本質也就相互地差異起來；由於這種本質的相異，所以想來說明其與純文學的分別，就更難了，何况，布爾喬亞的純文學，發展到了現在的階段，已經都變成了污淺的敗北主義的文學了呢！</p>
<p>大托爾斯泰給安特列夫的信裏，關於安特列夫的傾向於通俗文學，指摘了若干的通俗文學的特點：「一，不會遵守了由於非寫不可的要求才寫的文學的原則，失了眞實性和氣品。二，祗是注意於使讀者吃驚，恐怖的創造性裏。三？寫得忽忙，表現的純粹性等於零。四，其目的以為祗要適合於現代讀者的大衆性之要求與嗜好就够了。這是最有害之點，因為忽視了作為作家的使命。」像以上的指摘，當然不太完全，但的確含有了若干的托氏之卓見。</p>
<p>在托爾斯泰的時代裏，甚之把安特列夫的作品都當作通俗文學，但發展到了今日的通俗文學，是更加地變了質地，可以說完全被落伍的氣脈所支配了。</p>
<p>普遍地說起來，歐美方面的通俗文學，可以說是世紀末紀的副產物，日本的以及我國的通俗文學，可以說是封建文學的殘渣，前者可以法蘭西的德可勃拉，英國女流作家瑪麗·珂蕾梨等為例，後者可以直木三十五菊池寬等以及中國的鴛鴦蝴蝶派等為例。</p>
<p>通俗文學之所以能在今日的文壇，占有了不可拔的勢力·完全是有社會的根據的。西洋的通俗小說裏，最多的可以說是戀愛臘奇等享樂的作品以及冒險的空想的作品；　愛獵奇的作品，不用說，正是表現了現代的沒落的人物之荒淫的反映，像德可勃拉之諸作，即是好例子。關於冒險的幻想作品，這是一般的人間，厭倦於現實的世界，想從超現實世界裏，獲得超現實的趣味；因為環繞於今日的人類之世界，是災害苦痛飢餓平凡的綜和，為了脫離這種辛楚的世界，所以願意在非現置裏，我點安慰，驚人動魄的一時之快味。這些通俗文學可以舉·里亞·達克衣托之「綠地獄」，巴斯祁登之一南菲旅行記」等為例。</p>
<p>在日本的通俗文學，又名之謂大衆文藝，是完全繼承着江戶時代（德川將軍的幕府時代）的町人文學，這種文學，可以說是純封建的遺物，內容多以俠客勤王志士藝妓等為題材，這一點是如實地證明了日本的對建社會之依舊存在；這種文學的取村，大都側重於歷史的人物，使人們完全重歸於過去的現實生活中，在目前，這種通俗文學是盡了最大的對於現政治維護的力量。例如直木三十五的源平盛衰記相馬大作等，十一谷義三郎的神風連，吉川英治的忠臣藏，大佛次郎的水戶黃門等。</p>
<p>同時與這相異的，還有一種與歐美相仿的通俗文學，這種作品是反映了明治維新後的新興資本主義社會的末期底文學，內容都側重於戀愛享樂方面，這些作家大都是敗北主義的作家，例如菊池寬的貞操問答，吉屋信十的一個貞操，佐藤紅綠的絹的泥鞋等。</p>
<p>關於中國的通俗文學，我不想述，因為我記得茅盾先生對於張恨水的啼笑姻緣，會說了許多關於封建的通俗文學之卓見。</p>
<p>我們在上面，旣然認淸了通俗文學在現社會上的根據，但我們却不能把通俗文學之興盛，完全推之於社會的根源，我相信，通俗文學在若干的點上，是確有其優長之點的。這優點是什麼呢？即是故事的有趣，複雜，文章的通俗。美國的某文學史家，關於通俗文學曾指出了幾點的特徵：一·現代的地，感覺的地，浮漲着勞圍的創造性。二·多變化，把事件的葛藤，漸高揚到破局點。三·認誠現代讀者之討厭冗煩，要求結局早暸知，多動，有趣。我認為在有趣這點上，歐美的通俗文學與東洋的通俗文學是相同的；這種故事的有趣，是的確優越於純文學的。其次在文章上，是易於被理解，不像純文學的深澀。我們舉個例來看吧，像科南道爾的福爾摩斯偵探錄，就得比狄更斯的雙城故事等來得有趣味多，這譯本在中國的銷售上，就可以看到了二個極大的差異。這無他，是由於祥爾摩斯偵探錄是種通俗的文學作品，并且文章上是來得通俗。</p>
<p>最近在蘇聯的作家大會裏，亦曾談到了强調故事的趣味性，我相信，在現代的我們底文學裏，正缺少了故事的趣味，譬如以春蠶和啼笑姻緣即是個極佳的對照吧！</p>
<p>在現在中國通俗文學旺盛的時候——以南北諸報，都載章回小說，即是明例——我們想排斥這種通俗文學，則我們必須在我們的文學裏，接受通俗文學的若干長點，我們應强調了故事的趣味，複雜，多動；而淘汰其封建和敗北的意識。</p>
<p>目前，在蘇聯的確產生了一種新的通俗文學，那即是普里鮑衣底諸作，例如「日本海大戰」（「對馬」）「死綫」等。這些作品都是描寫日俄大戰的海軍戰狀，內容是非常地有趣味化，例如俄艦的自戰，誤擊英國商船，水兵提督的臆病等等；可以說是正合於一般人的口味，這種有趣味地方，正把沙皇政治的腐敗，暴露毫無完膚，這種通俗文學的價値，不但無遺毒留給讀者，並且給讀者以歷史的敎訓，使人理解了歷史的進化階段。所以我們在現代通俗文學占大優勢的現狀下，我們須刻苦地學習普里鮑衣般的通俗文學，多變化，多趣味，而且含着進步的敎訓，這樣地我們的文學，可以獲得了廣大的讀者，那封建的荒淫冒險的通俗文學，就能漸漸地滅亡下去。</p>
<h3>義和團彈詞（下）</h3>
<p>— 寒峰</p>
<p>滿淸官吏視民衆的生命如戲兒，於此可見。所以那時候的民衆，是在種種的迫害之中的，一面是官吏豪紳，一面是敎民洋人。義和團的成長，可說就是這些受迫害的民衆無可奈何鋌而走險的，一種希圖自救的辦法。我們就從帝國全義用綠氣砲攻天津，向北京城裏拚命的放大砲的兩點上，也可以想見他們的殘酷。作者寫天津城破以後說：「各屍倒地，死無傷痕。甚至城破三點鐘後，洋兵見有華人多名，擎槍倚牆，怒目而立，一若將要開放的情形，等到近前一看，始知已中砲氣而死，祗以身倚在牆，故未倒地」（第十一卷，）這是多麼悲壯的塲面！在這時，要避免他們的騷擾，祇有在門上貼着一個條子，寫着「大日本順民」字樣，這又是何等壓迫的慘狀！這時的民衆，眞是所謂：</p>
<p>故使生靈遭刦運，破家亡產蕩無存。拋男撇女齊逃命，露宿風餐不像人。遇到官兵恣擄掠，若逢匪類卽奸淫。洋兵蓄恨將仇報，碰着之時命亦傾。棘地荊天無路走，每從溝壑了殘生。死屍拋棄如山積，血水成河舟不行。慘酷情形寫不盡，這書中，十分祗有兩三分。（第十一卷）</p>
<p>天津的情况如此，北京也是：「兵卽是匪匪卽兵，兵匪合一亂胡行。排槍好似連珠砲，哭喊之聲不忍聞。巨賈豪商都被刦，大家小戶不安寗。匪徒一到開箱看，到處搜羅金與銀。上屋跳牆都做到，塡街塞路盡兵丁。」（第七卷）兩兩對照，人民是在怎樣的夾攻迫害之中啊！這種慘象，不僅中國人看到，就是當時開來進攻中國的外國軍隊中人，亦同樣的紀載着。法國綠蒂當時寫的一部通信，所寫民衆受迫害的傷心慘目狀况，是有甚於此的。當然，外國人在這一次受犧牲的也是很多，據本書所記，凡山西省的外人，無論男女老幼，就同時的被督撫騙去殺了，北京一次的轟炸，小孩子就死了一二零人以上。這殘暴，一樣是一種獸性的。作者是用了一回長書，寫了山西外人被殺的慘景。寫毓賢殺外國女人，甚至「縛住她的兩手，取把尖刀從她下部向上一戳，竟是穿心破肚而亡。」（第十三卷）他母親想救下最後一個外國孩子，都遭拒絕了。</p>
<p>「義和團演義」這部書，由於繁複的事實，而作者又不願放棄某一方面，祗是應收盡收的原故，一般的說，是有凌亂駁雜的缺點。短短的二十回書，要寫義和團的全部事實，宮庭官吏方面的情形，南北各省的狀態，中外人民所受的迫害，不斷的燒殺，搶刦和戰爭，陰謀與詭計，事實上本就困難的，其無特殊成果，那是當然的結果。寫官吏方面的傾軋殺害，是頗見成功，寫義和團，只盡力的暴露了他們的殘暴，動機方面沒有給護者一個更明確的印象。我覺得這部書，若把它作為史料書看，其價値是超過作為文學書看而上的。此書無出版處，大約是一個小書局所印，和「庚子國變彈詞」一樣，現在是很難以得到的了。（完）</p>
<h3>店徒</h3>
<p>— 陳福熙</p>
<p>祗要一提到沈福記成衣鋪，大家便知道這舖裏有個可憐的店徒。沈福記開在一條不熱鬧的街上，那條街，店舖，人，石板的街道，都含有質樸的十八世紀的古風。破舊的店面，開着醬園，肉店，荳腐店，南貨，水菓，茶館和雜貨店。沈福記店面就嵌在這些店舖中間。曉得沈福記成衣舖的，就曉得沈福記的針線做得頂好，有衣服做，都願意，拿到他那邊者，但沈福記的老板，又是出名的兇，對待他的學徒，更格外的酷虐。</p>
<p>老板是瘦個子。平常縫紉時，戴一副銅邊的老花眼鏡，等看人，老是把眼珠子溜出眼鏡邊。他年紀老了，有許多生活來不及做，故在去年收了個學徒，許多輕便的活計，和零星的雜作，都讓學徒去做了。其實，老板並沒有多大敎他學針線，只是把他當作奴僕，敎他抱孩子，掃地，買菜，洗碗，什麼事都要做，沒有空閑的。</p>
<p>「阿福，你這死鬼！叫你抱孩子都不會！」</p>
<p>抱着孩子，如果老板聽到孩子哭，就響着喉嚨罵。阿福每天抱孩子，總想盡方法，使他不會哭。洗碗碟，燒飯，要是不當心把碗打碎，或將飯燒焦，那老板就要發怒，就要打他，直打到他討饒才止。阿福年輕，做生活還不周到。一件剛縫到的華絲葛夾衫，老板叫他燙燙挺，但阿福不留神，一塊火炭翻下來，把衣服燙焦了，一個大大的火洞，恰恰焦在前胸，是一個看得出，不可想法的地方。阿福心慌了，急得發哭。</p>
<p>「死鬼！哭幹嗎？」</p>
<p>「燙……燙……燙焦了……」</p>
<p>師傳把衣服拿到手裏，從那副老花眼鏡裏望到那個大大的火洞時，一股無各火，突然爆發了，嘴裏嘩啦嘩啦的罵。。</p>
<p>「畜生！昏死了嗎！」</p>
<p>接着，一個響亮的耳光。</p>
<p>擎起竹尺子，夾頭夾腦的打過去。從店面打到屋角，從屋角直打到灶披間，屋子裏只有哭聲，只有呌罵。站在店門前的是鄰居，但他們只是看打，沒人勸。裁縫老板的脾氣有點兒怪：當他打得冒了火，旁人勸，反而被他怪怨：所以曉得的都袖手旁觀了。打一回，每一回打得皮開肉綻的。阿福剛來做學徒辰光，臉蛋兒肥肥的，白白的，帶着一點紅潤，舉止也非常活潑：天眞；但現在，一個十四歲的孩子，他的態度完全變成一個大人模樣。天眞的心情，在阿福的小靈魂裏，好像影子漸漸地消失在晨曦的曙光裏。他個子老是不高，進店到現在，差不多年半了，可是他一點沒有高大；走路的樣子，像小猢猻那麼跳躍。那從前紅潤潤的，像桃花一樣紅的臉色，現在却一點看不到，他的臉上，除了骨頭，皮，就是一層黯然的，憔悴的陰影。照鏡子，常常叫他驚異：他記得在家時候，又胖，又强壯，現在變得這樣子，正彷彿換了人，連自已也不認識了。</p>
<p>「阿福眞苦呵！進店那一年……」</p>
<p>被師傅毒打，旁人就這麼說的，阿福屢次聽到，他的眼淚就撲簌簌的掉下來。但阿福，自從進了這沈福記成衣鋪，以後就沒有出來，成年成月，在這淫威的師傳裏討生活，那嚴重的活計，壓迫着這個營養不足的孩子。在嚴寒的，寂寞的冬夜，夜那麼深，外面吹着風，飄着雪，只有阿福，獨個兒坐在美孚燈旁，張着疲倦了的眼睛，一針針，一針針的密縫着手中的新衣……</p>
<h3>巨卿先生（十）（四）</h3>
<p>— 柯靈</p>
<p>靜悄悄地，學校裏沒有半個人影子。巨卿先生躡手跺脚往裏面走，他像初次做賊偷了人家的東西，淸晰地聽得見自已心跳的聲音。</p>
<p>好容易到了揭示處，「揭示牌」上眞的挨挨擠擠都是告示。</p>
<p>心慌意亂地從頭看下去：敎務處的課程表，學生自治會的會議規則，會計處催繳學費和書籍費的通告，總理逝世紀念日停課誌哀的通告，植樹節放假的通告，「三一八」慘案紀念休業的通告……找了半天，才在後面找着一張特別加大的——</p>
<p>敬告全體學生家厦書！</p>
<p>一行歪來倒去用「自由體」寫成的大字標題跳進限睛，心更跳得要掙出胸膛來，掉下地去似的，趕緊往下看：</p>
<p>「親愛之父兄們！</p>
<p>查本鎭私塾林立，多如雨後之春筍！此輩塾師，頭腦冬哄，（巨卿先生對「哄」字投了一個鄙夷的白眼）完全不合時代潮流！違背孫總理之黨化敎育！而且在鎭上擾亂學校，貽誤兒童，甚屬可恨！現在本校……</p>
<p>是圾重要的地方了，他眼睛睜得很大，死命地向布告搜獵着，像賭徒看他孤注一擲的最後一副排，好在傾刻間决定自已的運命。正在這當口，忽然後面「砰」的一聲，門開了，操塲上一片小孩子的喧笑聲跟着擁進來。巨卿先生慌張得有些手足無措。唔，不對，心一虛，他忽忽地拔脚往外面走。</p>
<p>還沒走出天井，七八個汗污淋漓，面孔通紅，頭上冒着熱氣的學生，却巳經從橫刺轉了出來，彼此碰了個對面。</p>
<p>巨卿先生覺得沒法逃避了，索性放慢了脚步，反剪着雙手，好像在參觀展覽會似的，四面望着，身子慢慢的向外面移。跑出校門就好了：他想。可是為首捧着個大皮球在懷裏的學生巳經注意了他。</p>
<h3>芳隣</h3>
<p>— 阿魏</p>
<p>霧，像一張簾，把</p>
<p>遠的靑山隔住了。</p>
<p>霧，像一張簾，把</p>
<p>對隣紗窗下的一副粉臉也隔住了。</p>
<p>昨天是，不，</p>
<p>天天都是：</p>
<p>黃昏時，對隣的紗窗下，</p>
<p>有一副披着長髮的粉臉，</p>
<p>從窗口裏出現，</p>
<p>對着我痴痴地注視，</p>
<p>微笑，媚笑，</p>
<p>吻着小指，</p>
<p>兩眼送出靑春慾火的光，</p>
<p>忽然，又裝着苦臉，</p>
<p>縐了眉，垂了頭，</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>關於收音機柩車</h3>
<p>— 家為</p>
<p>昨日在報端讀到這樣的一則新聞：「本市營業之音樂隊，不僅服裝離奇，且所奏音樂，亦復不倫；甚或有喜慶宴會而奏哀樂，或外國國歌。喪事出殯而奏時歌小調者，謬妄荒唐，貽笑中外。上海市政府竹經令行主管各局，餒加取締：近復有出殯禮汽車裝置收音機，沿途隨意收放歌曲，更屬不成事體；希望社會民衆，通曉大體，勿再雇用此類音樂隊及汽車，以昭莊重，而效風尙。」</p>
<p>果眞，像這類「謬妄荒唐，貽笑中外」的事實，我們住在上海的人，是見聞的太多了——甚至一日有數起；而且要若過到了一般闊姥大」為他們的尊大人或尊夫人舉行「大出喪」，那就非雇上十幾班音樂隊，走上幾個鐘頭不可；甚甚且把那些本來已經是「馬路如虎口，當中不可走的大街道，擠鬧得將幾成「一步不可走」的了！</p>
<p>不過，在我們這號稱為、東方紐約」而住有二百五十萬居民的「十里洋塲」上，更在這個一面旣要崇尙文明，而另一面又想保持着固有的封建殘餘的二重社會狀能態之下，這一種離奇」，「荒唐」的現象，原並不是偶然的吧！同時，在為着不可免的喪拿殯禮，而又得節省人手與時間的條件之下，這種運柩汽車上裝起收音機來，實不足為奇的吧？要是說句「麼登」的話，這正是在趨向「科墨化」呢？</p>
<p>記得在某漫畫雜誌上曾見過一幀題名「迷信科學化」的畫——在一個沒有入殮的死屍的靈前，放着一座正在播音「那摩阿彌陀佛；大慈大悲，救苦救難…」的收音機。想這位畫者是有這「先見之明」的了。</p>
<p>無綫電之在中國，她的用途能有這麼廣，這在發明者馬可尼先生也似乎意想不到的吧？至於因為這個「謬妄荒唐」「不成事體，」而加以取締，那是另外的一回事。我們這里可管不了——不過，我們却也可知道：在每月無綫電進口値數十萬金的驚人巨數之下，這種用在迷信科學化」上的收音機，也將佔到一個相當的數目吧？</p>
<p>在這里，却又使人記起有人說過這樣的一句話：「外國人發明了束西，中國人來享受。外國人直作了我們的牛馬，奴隸！」這個，我們大中國人似乎是聰明（！）極了。然而，在這個「聰明」的條件之下，我們這自號自慰着「地大」，「物博」，「民庶」的中國，將不知走上怎樣的道路呢？</p>
<h3>憶</h3>
<p>— 佳</p>
<p>呵，無論是幻，是夢，是現實，我總是永為世間的不幸者了。而也唯有在夢裏邊對於你的容顏作着依稀的縈迴，我還能希求到什麼呢？那新的墓土，新的碑銘，新的靑草，憂鬱凋亡的無限的怨愁，當月華映着窗影的時分，當秋風拂着零落的花葉，妮妮：我的滿腔的慘情向誰去哭訴呢？你同着無贖的年靑的遺憾長睡於冥冥之中，我的純情也預備從此永埋於冷漠的荒蕪的心底。妮妮，你的生命為我的自由而消失了，想不到我剛從地獄同到陽光裏的世界，你竟悄</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>悄地閉上眼睛。你的悾惚的十九個年頭的靑春的光陰，彷彿就如一朶養息在熱島的秀媚的紅芙，祗含笑於秋天裏的一眨眼間便歿了。夜生黃土，是你長息的安閑的地方，可是在倦厭於人生紛擾的網的生的勞碌者的心靈上，這遭逢比之受銀刃的　割更劇痛，無形的鮮血在不停的淌下來。惱人的微雨籠罩着海上的黃昏，我的心陰間到像黑夜一樣了，在這樣的雨夕，花叢之前，我對着你的渺茫的孤魂哀泣，此外我還期待茶麼，妮妮！</p>
<p>我嗜愛海濱溫雅的麗景，而你却是在海濱的麗景中長育起來的。在那裏，海的遠處，岸的遠處，藍色的天幕蓋着藍色的海水，藍色的海水蕩漾在和煦的高陽懷抱裏，躺在濃蔭的椰林底下，靑靑的草地是自然的柔軟的舖蓆，望望成羣的白羽的海鷗在頭上，一會兒旋遠，一會兒旋近，近近的，遠遠的投擲來一串淸脆的歌唱。而霎朶被馱在它們背上，作着各樣幻美的圓案的變遷的姿態，妮妮，你的火熾的情熱正是這海國特有的賦予，而你那雙老是蒙着一層薄霧似的眼睛，是富於懷念遠方的故人之感的，因為你自小便見償江頭送別的情婦，穿着大紅色的褲繼，依偎着遠行的男人，絮絮偶語，也要齕胳斷臂那兒的金釧，以為心影相契的紀物，帆影在烟波裏忽隱忽現，多麼載着無邊的離情啊！</p>
<p>妮妮，我還淸晰地記往着，我們時常並肩緩行在那夕陽照得紫不溜兒的夾在修長的草地間的小路上，新月打海的那邊的天角露出了半截臉兒，一面走，一面你便低低地唱裴多勞的月光曲來，我亦用着口哨子吹和，這時候金色的落日給海水鍍上金色的邊沿，你的面龐被映着更有一種說不出的動人的情調，四野是那樣寂然，沒半絲聲嚮，惟有輕凉的晚風捲着歌聲浸到水波裏去了然而這溫柔的沈醉現在却成了難堪的辛楚的回憶！</p>
<p>呵！妮妮，秋風又披着一身蕭殺的氣息渡到人間了，當早上晚間禮拜堂敲出凄厲的銅鈸，你知不知有個孤靈的幽影徘徊的冷落的古道上，向着海的遠處望月野祭？你竟然是走得那麼輕快，那麼悠忽，又那麼安靜，像一陣雲，一陣烟樣的。一點也沒有牽掛，難道這世間一眞沒一件東西値你多為留戀一下麼？不會的吧，妮妮，只有我知道你是帶着無告的永恨同着身子深埋於地下的，因為那個傳達你不幸的消息給我的來客，他會用着一種非常闇鬱的表情說着你快要停止最後一口呼吸的辰光，沒有留給旁邊的人一句話，也沒說什麼，祗是在喉嚨里頻頻地呼喚着我的名字，之後，便翻一翻眼皮，靜靜地闔了上去了。唉！妮妮，當我聽完了這可怕的叙述和那來客口畫着使我恐怖的形象，霎時間，我幾乎僵硬在那裏，差點沒暈過去。</p>
<p>一切都有如烟一般的飄渺呵！誰料想得到野草擁着土竟是你永生的家。而我這風塵跋涉的孱弱的零餘者，還來領受心靈創痛再加上一層莫莫的割裂，如今：我是全沒理想，沒念頭，沒夢，也沒眼淚，我是跌入冰窖之中過着日子的！</p>
<h3>樊籠小唱（上）</h3>
<p>— 秦鑒</p>
<p>我逛過好多次動物園，我也到過買賣塲上的烏市；於是，一種喧雜的，大量的小動物的嘩噪從密層層排列着，堆疊着的箱籠的柵欄裏面飄出來了：聲音是雜亂的；然而却有着無窮盡的沈重，它鎭壓着又窒息着一種人的靈魂，像蛇，像隕星。</p>
<p>然而過往的人羣却嘻嘻地笑起來啦；小動物的鳴呌治平了人世間的疲勞的創傷：「瞧，親愛的，那些美麗的小東西唱得多快樂，多可愛，多動人啊———說，對嗎？」</p>
<p>「是的，可是你底聲音却更美麗呢，親愛的。」</p>
<p>便那麼玩賞着，調笑着，懷着一種輕快心情，悠閒地一個樊籠又一個樊籠地經過了。</p>
<p>（少年人，懂得去享受一個更適宜於歡娛的時代吧——靑春是自由的，靑春是沒有覊絆的，靑春是神聖而可貴的啊！）</p>
<p>然而，誰料得到呢？給和外面的廣大的天地隔絕了而又被抓來放在金絲籠裏的小動物，她們——無千無萬的她們，所日夜記念着的，也許不是那種用自由去換來的侮辱與玩弄的供養，而却是遠處原野裏的一枝靑翠的小草，與一滴晶塋然而又不値錢的山泉水呢！</p>
<p>而那些龐大的呼聲——被人們武斷地認作是美麗的歌唱而欣賞着的呼聲，難道也眞像嬌媚的月下的小唱一樣的美麗的嗎？</p>
<h3>又一馬戲團來滬</h3>
<p>— 戈</p>
<p>海京伯在日本碰壁之後，到中國來居然滿載而歸，這個有力的宣傳，使第二個馬戲團又直接來華，然而售座不佳，終於遁去。據觀光過的人說，兩班的異獸及技術並不相差過甚，而售座的縣殊，令人不可思議；况前者最高座價售至五元之巨，反賺了一筆錢去，可謂有幸有不幸矣。</p>
<p>其實，這是最也簡單不過的事，生活在這大都市中的有閑階級，衣食無憂，起居安適，要消遺這悠長的歲月，無時無刻不想出一些新奇的玩意兒來求精神的刺激，但是鄉下人認為萬花筒般的上海，在他們看來早巳平淡無奇了。海京伯的取道上海，正是對症下藥，投其所好，自然滿載而歸了。</p>
<p>這是一例。其他如魔術，歌舞團亦復如此，當最初一班來滬的時侯，售座均至五元之巨，繼其來者，雖然用「活僵屍，」或「處女」等奇驚廣告號召，結果皆不能盡如人意。碧眼兒但知中國是個賣買的好市塲，不過沒有十分明暸華人的脾胃；這是指娛樂而言，其他或許並不必盡然，因為中國人深印着，外國都是好的！」印象。</p>
<p>如今又有個英國伊索古馬戲團兼程來華了，報上已見本月廿一日開幕的廣告了，從那些老虎，猴子用傳聲筒喊出來的「上海快到了！」的擊語，彷彿烟兌店門前「航空獎券今日下午開獎」一樣地有「立致巨富」的希望，但是這個「歐美藝員一百二十位，歌舞名角二十四位，馬五十匹，象八頭，獅十，虎十二，以及駱駝班馬等」的大馬戲團底前途，未許樂觀吧。</p>
<p>因海京伯的印像未消，馬戲團的玩意兒不過如此，而且在春天，公子小姐决不肯放棄到虎丘，靈隱去玩一玩兒的機會，不能旅行的就沒有資格來看「表演絕佳」的馬戲團，雖然海京伯公演的時候，有些人拚命向六角座擁擠而從高梯上掉下來，現在恐怕决不有這種偉大的勇氣了！</p>
<h3>歸國的前後（續）</h3>
<p>— 重林</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>到香港是大淸早，船停在九龍，我們三個半人——連王君在內一！上岸去，先在九龍走了個團子。</p>
<p>「這地方好麼？」我問我的孩子。</p>
<p>「不好，」他回答：「但是很發笑的。」</p>
<p>我們聽着他這句話，不覺笑起來了。</p>
<p>從九龍渡江到香港的小輪上坐滿了好些家住九龍到香港去上工作的英國人，中國人呢，全是些苦力與小工。</p>
<p>我們走進一家門口掛着畫有蛇與老虎廣告的點心館子，我們一坐下後就悔起來了，一張鑲有假大理石的小圓桌，桌上是濕的，可是店主再三呌我們放東西上去好了，說那是乾凈的。我們正在為難地商量吃呢不吃的時侯，蝦仁拏來了，那蝦仁還是透明的，離煮熟還遠得很。這時侯，在我們旁邊，坐下了兩個穿綢褂綢褲的男子，他們一邊談着為我們所聽不懂的話，一邊望着我們，一邊出神地挖脚。</p>
<p>我們像逃似的出了這個點心館子。</p>
<p>隨後三個半人就去跑街路。</p>
<p>「你看那廣告，牠把我眼睛的視綫都遮暗了，」三個人當中不知是誰先說。</p>
<p>越到東方那廣告越來得多，東方商人是最會做廣告的，特別是中國人，在這方面，他們也完全與猶太人一樣。他們個個心裏都要把自已的廣告掛的特別多，紅紅綠綠的特別招眼，可是，他的左右，對面鄰人也是這樣想，這樣做，結果，兩邊店舖的廣告旗子，把一條小小的街道電遮了起來，末了，他們自已的廣告把他們的廣告遮掩，過客的眼睛也不願去注意這些太多而看不淸的廣告。我就是這樣不願注意這些廣告的一人。（完）</p>

<h3>保羅蒙尼說每星期二十五元亦可以快樂（下）</h3>
<p>— 素因</p>
<p>保羅蒙尼於是不慌不忙的，說出他兩個大理由來。他說：「我第一個理由，就是金錢可以給與我所愛的一個保障。我的母親，我的父親，都嘗過胞餓的滋味，都受過貧窮的恥辱。他們的生活，是常常在恐怖之中的，對於房東的恐怖，對於冬天寒冷的恐怖，不一而足，這些東西，對於我一個人的影響，還沒有對於他們的大，因為我年輕，抱負很大。但是他們的苦楚，却在我心中留了一個不可磨減的印象。</p>
<p>「如果我祇是獨身一個人，我亦不用愁什麼保障。但是，我旣有了妻子家室，我就不得不為他們求到生活上的安全了。我的夫人並沒有要求過什麼保障。她無論什麼地方，都肯跟着我走的。如果我要放棄了一切，而做一個叫化子，她亦一定跟着我就走的。但是在我一方面，我却情願她不再感到什麼缺乏。並且越是這種賢慧的女子，你越是覺得要替她盡心竭力的做去。</p>
<p>「講到我的第二個理由，獻是我希望將來有一天，我建造我自已的小戲隊……或者我可以自己攝製自己的影。。這些影片，不一定要我自己表演，更不一定要賺錢。但是却－定要是良好的影片。我對於將來的計劃，還沒有決定，所以現在亦不能多說什麼話。我所要說的，不過始我要在表演界有良好的作品，而金錢可以帮助我那種成就而巳。</p>
<p>「照我的意見天下的演員以蘇　的為最好。他們做了好演員，但是他們並不出名。他們的職份，是在戲院中表演，而不是在社會上出風頭。戲院就是他們的工作，他們的生活，他們的世界。我的生活亦是照着那樣做的。所以當我要扮演一個礦工的時侯，我就想做一個眞實的礦工。我就跑到礦穴裹去，學習礦工是什麽樣子的。我要學着礦工怎麼思想的。我思想統和礦工一樣之後，我的行動談話，都活像一個礦工了。這種籌備的工作，在一張影片開拍以前，總要用好幾星期的功夫。</p>
<p>「然後，我還要作化裝的試騐。我并不是喜歡化裝。我想眞正的藝術是不用化裝的，但是我還做不到。不過在我不得不利用化裝的時候，我必須力求其逼真。我在家裹有一所化裝的「試騐室。」我常常晚上在我的化裝室中，試騐新的效果。</p>
<p>「我並且常常用傳聲機，無論在家中，或在攝影塲上，向傳聲機說了對白，然後將所收的音放出來。我自已審察着自已的聲調適當與否。有時我為一句話而用一個鐘頭的工夫去練習，處處要力求其逼眞。但是，等到我一張影片拍完了，我就不再會看它了，我要擲開，忘記，如同一隻鴨子抖去它背上的水似的，因為一定要擲開，遺忘了第一張片子裏的角色，然後才可以計劃開拍第二張片子也。</p>
<p>「我一張片子定成之後，就不再去看它了。我立即開始談戲劇和故事，尋覓新的題村。有的時候，一張影片出版之後，有人問我那張片子，我喜歡不喜歡，我會茫然不知所答的，因為我怎樣表演的，都已遺忘了。我强迫我遺忘。或者這亦是心理上的一種反動。</p>
<p>「不錯的，我愛表演，但是我亦深恨表演。我愛表演，是因為我得到了一種撳動，在一個藝術表示得意時的撳動。但是我恨它，是因為表演之中往往包含着不忠實和卑賤。因此，我對淤忠實的演員，抱有無限的崇敬，而對於一般演員，拿表演騙取金錢和虛名的，却一些同情心沒有的。」</p>
<p>從以上的談話，我們可以知道保羅蒙尼許多特殊的個性。他是一個誠實的演員。他是沒有虛偽和掩飾的。他具有一種超人的精神——從工作方面可以得到表演的酬報和安慰。由此而觀之，「我們就可以明白當他說，他賺了二十五塊錢一個星期，亦可快活的時候，他並不是隨便亂說的了。（完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「人倫」—新光</h3>
<p>— 兆人</p>
<p>人們曾經將這一影片和亡命者相提並論，其實我以為這是不必要的，因為這兩部影片，很少有相同之點。「亡命者」主要在暴露美國監獄的黑暗這點上，有着很大的價値，而這一影片雖然也採取了一點關於囚犯的題材，可是絕沒有暴露的意味，這「人倫」和「亡命者」乃是完全異趣的。</p>
<p>作為倫埋彤片的人倫」，劇作者雖然對於碼頭工人的主人公給與了同情，至少對於他生活的苦楚和遭遇的不幸的描寫，佔了影片的一部份膠片。但是劇作者並不在主人公身上描寫他們之一羣的圾典型的姿態，而是在這一羣中找了一個極性懦的也是作者認為善良的人物，作為給與同情的目的物，而且他遭遇的不幸，乃是他好酒糊塗，以致於關禍，所以這不幸，正是這好酒好賭的糊塗虫個人的不幸，即如他被判入獄所遺下的妻兒，就是幸運者。她姘上了一個顏料商，而且）工顏料商在第一次世界中發了財，由小商人的地位，一躍而為銀行經理，於是這苦力之妻夢想不到成了高貴的太太，她的兒子也是金庫主任了。</p>
<p>本來，世間的事，也許眞是無奇不有，這種事在劇作者的想像中是　以成立的。而且不僅如此，厦凑巧的是那煳塗虫的工人，在出獄之後，劇作者更使他在親生子的手下做傭人，親生兒脚踢着親生父，作為這倫理片圾中心的支點。到後來是主人公愛兒情切，冒險的營救兒子於危難之中，自已落得慘死的下塲，反而沒有得着妻的諒解，雖然他的兒子在他死後也懂得他是一個好人。</p>
<p>這曲折的情節，在中國電影目前的發展中，是給作家們很大的注意的。至少對於一般要求離奇情節的觀衆們是有着興味的，假使作者能將這情節電影藝術的也表現出來的話。但是這一點是不能不使人失望的，也許在作者本身也會感受到失望的苦痛，原因是他們並沒有獲得原來所預期的效果。先就故事的構成說，無論劇作者怎樣找着余三進和理銀行的理由，可是這正是不能掩飾的破綻：謝雲卿所飾的馬路英雄他是應該知道陸先生怎樑發財以及余三的兒子是「油瓶」等等的，（至少並沒有說他不知道的理由。）因而他憑什麼會介紹親父的余三去，而且余三並不是伶俐的人，一個老廢物對於盜匪有什麼用呢？其他還有許多的堆砌，不勝枚舉。同樣屬於技術問題的，在導演表演各方而都沒有什麼特別好的成績。導演除了賣弄（些小聰明之外，並不能怎樣的發揚悲劇的動人情感。主角襲稼農，在個性上略有成就，然而不能做出應當發揮的戲來，尤其在化裝方面，假裝駝背和老年的鬍鬚，都是十分潦草的。其他諸人倒還平平，可以過得去。</p>
<h3>評「春風秋雨」</h3>
<p>— 鐘非</p>
<p>Lmitation　of　life　—南京</p>
<p>讀者諸君，假使你是看過「春風秋雨」這一影片的話，我猜想你一定大為感動的了。這裏是那末重厚的人情世味的發揮，這裏是深入的掘發了人生滋味的悲哀與歡樂。是的，原作者從兩對母女的身上，描寫着倫理的至愛至誠，她暗示着世間只有母愛的偉大纔能逾越一切的。這些在電影上表現出來，導演史迪爾（JohnM．Stahl）是非常圓滿的獲得了文學電影藝術的成功。</p>
<p>他為了將鴨子（玩具）作為最後的結東，在開頭便是鴨子的特寫。立刻便從小女兒不肯去托兒所說明寡婦斐亞需要一個帮理家政的人，當她為了生計不能不拋開小女兒出去的時候，雖然她在經濟上不能做到。她是能幹而敏捷的女人，她一面接電話（介紹她的身世），一面要照顧小孩，一面又要照顧廚房，如此忙碌的她，黑種女人安蒂苔莉拉的求傭，當然是來得正好。就在這幾塲戲中，我們看到導演不僅是對於主要人物的個性能够生動的描寫，而在房東，油漆匠諸人身上，都由於極適當的分派演員而獲得了成功。同樣，飾埃爾曼的尼德斯派克的登塲，他以在「四十二號街」等片中同樣的姿態，從嗅着餅香到吃過餅後敎給她們用罐裝粉發售，他那可愛的性格便極明快的表現出來了。</p>
<p>當一僩女人在事業上成功之後是需要一個熱情的男人的，這在女黑人嘴裏多次說到，等到魚種學家的華倫威廉（WarrenWilliam）的上塲，他在夜間摸不着門鈴的一點上，使我們看到了學者的特性。可是進門之後和斐亞的克拉黛考爾白（CaudetteColbert）跳舞的時候，他那近乎風流的姿態，不免破壞了統一的個性，雖然他以後的熱情，誠實，都表演得極好。然而當男女的情愛和母女間的親愛發生衝突的時候，當斐亞看見女黑人失了女兒而愛悒以死的時候，她是深深地感到愛情的幻滅，在月夜謝絕了情人回憶到母女間的融融之樂了。</p>
<p>母愛的偉大，在這裏是作為全劇之主題的原作者因為要表現這一點，使母親的斐亞和女黑人為了女兒而勞作。可是女黑人的女兒却為了種族的羞辱，她不要黑種的母親，她堅决的離開母親遠去，以致母親為之憂鬱以死。這飾十九歲的茀蘭地華盛頓（FaediWashington）在很少的幾塲戲中，眞是演得極有內心表現的。特別是導演以極慢的律動處理葬儀，更出於茀蘭地極哀慟的撫棺痛哭懺悔，使我們深深的為之感動流淚，就在這理在技術上表現了悲劇的成功。</p>
<p>在美國，固然有了林肯的解放黑奴的呼聲，可是到現在黑人並沒有脫離奴隸的地位。他們是以有色人種而被文明的白種人岐視着的，這在美國的作家看來，當然認為不合理的，然而這襄原作者芬妮赫絲德是怎樣表現她的貝解呢？她從女兒身上表現着極力從黑種人變為白種人，她在母親身上表現着旣然黑種人是上帝的創造，還有什麼好說呢？可能做到的祗要有錢，便可以在死後的堂皇的葬儀上，顯耀一下，如此表現，正表現白種人的猫兒哭老鼠似的同情。</p>
<p>寫到這種為止，對於這一影片各方面，總算大概的說到一些。為了篇幅的限制，不能寫得更詳盡一點，眞是遺憾。不過還有一點必需說到的，那便是劇中主人公的克拉黛考爾白的演技。她眞是一個天才而又有修養的演員，她是那樣一點不過火表演到應該做到的程度，無論是臉部或身材，都爐火純靑的顯示她對於寅技極有修養。就此說明這是集中了各方面的優秀的技術人材，完成了這一技術成就極高的「春風秋雨」的了。</p>

<h3>業餘記者（After　Office　Houts）（十一）</h3>
<p>— 彤雲</p>
<p>雪倫看了有些奇怪。等彭尼斯德進來了，她就想問他。彭尼斯德一面叫雪倫替他打領結，一面裝着一種慘笑。雪倫道：「我看見你的。」她的聲音發抖了。她心中一陣害怕。她覺得要狂喊起來。等到他掉過頭來望他自已屋子裏去的時候，她就奔向房門想逃走。但是他已知道了追了上來，一把將雪倫揪了過來。現在他才知道他那隻手的力量。她知道了。她狂呌起來：「別碰我！別碰我！那是你做的！你殺死她的！」</p>
<p>大門忽然洞開了。勃郎却和巴爾走了進來，兩個人的身上，都是泥水汪汪的。勃郎却冷笑着道：「對不起，來晚了一些。因為我們看了他一次一次的沒水之後，我們費了許多工夫，才從那一大堆的木頭裏爬了出來。」雪倫連忙接口道：「不錯的。當謀殺案發生的晚上，他是出去取木頭的……」彭尼斯德的眼睛，着雪倫，兇光四射，可怕極了。勃郎却道：「原來他昨夜到木頭堆裏去的，是不是？這就够送他到電椅上去的了。」，</p>
<p>雪倫又問道：「對了末你怎麼會知道珠麗亞柏德森，昨夜遺失了一隻粉盒的呢？」勃郞却道：「我并不知道，我不過想試試他作什麽舉動罷了。」雪倫聽了，她一切的愛，一切的佩服，都隱藏不住了。彭尼斯德猛然間向着勃郎却衝了上來，但是勃郎却的手脚太快了，他拳頭一揮，彭尼斯德早就倒在地下了。勃郞却將彭尼斯德打倒了之後面，不慌不忙的吩咐巴爾道：「你先打電話雲端呌警察來。打完了電話，你來看住了這個兇手，讓我再打電話到報館里去。這是大新聞。這是我們所獨有的了。」</p>
<p>明天早晨，密昔司那各脫正在用早餐。她談着報紙上所登載的柏德森案子。她手不忍釋的讀着，咖啡都冷了，忽然僕人進來報告道：「佐丹先生來了。」佐丹一進門就問道：「我可以見見傑姆嗎？傑姆勃郎却？」</p>
<p>密昔司覺得莫名其妙起來，但是那僕人却故意咳了一聲，禀告道：「勃郎却先生在家裏。」佐丹道：「他一定在這裏。半個鐘頭以前，他還向報館裏打電話，叫他們怎樣繼續打聽那個案子。我們查出來，電話是從這裏打出去的。」那僕人道：「不錯的。勃郎却先生和雪倫小姐在一起。他們在客人臥房裏呢。」</p>
<p>密昔司那各脫聽了，立即向外奔着，佐丹追在後面。她走到客室的房口，先敲着門，然後自已開了門走了進去。她不進猶可，一進去嚇了她一跳。這時雪倫還在床上酣睡着，傑姆呢，他着著一身陲衣，坐在床邊上。密昔司那各脫看見了，張開了一張嘴，半句括說不出來，倒在椅子上了。</p>
<p>雪倫忽然醒了過來，她張開眼購就笑。她對着她的母親道：「這遺是他的主意。」她一雙眼睛水汪汪地看著傑姆，似有說不出的深情。傑姆接着道：「是我最好的一個主意了。」雪倫又笑着說道：「他說的，時候太晚了，已是早晨四點鐘了，不必再驚動你老人家，叫你從床上爬起來，來看我們結婚。」密昔司那各脫道。「結婚？你們結了婚了嗎，？」勃郎却笑着點了點頭，然後對着佐丹道：「你來做什麼？還是快回報館去。你知道，這是千鈞一髮的時候。你想我還能管報館裏的事嗎？我現在是在蜜月之中呀。」（完）</p>

<h3>Guizhou Bandit Suppression Army: Chen Detachment Occupies Qingyan; Remnant Bandits Flee Towards Guangshun; Hunan Army's Third Division Enters Guiyang</h3>
<p>Guiyang: Our Chen Jinta Detachment fiercely attacked the bandits who were fleeing towards Qingyan on the afternoon of the 10th, luring them in to fight.

The bandits fled towards Guangshun, and we occupied Qingyan at 7:00 AM. In this battle, over 400 bandits were killed, over 100 were captured, and over 100 guns were seized.

The bandits retreated and fled to the highlands around Tiantang. They are still being surrounded and suppressed. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>Kunming: After crossing the Wujiang River, the bandits continued eastward across the Qingshui River, threatening to enter Hunan. On the 8th, the entire force of over 20,000 men turned back from the east and rushed towards Guiyang via Xima River, intending to attack the city. Our Sun Detachment's various brigades had already been stationed around Longli and Guiding. At noon on the 8th, Gong Brigade made contact with the bandits' guerrillas at Guanyin Mountain and disarmed them completely that evening. The majority of the remnant bandits fled to the vicinity of Huangni Shao, 30 li from Guiyang, and made contact with our Lu and Gong Brigades. Our army intercepted the bandits into two sections, killing over 3,000 bandits and capturing countless others. This was the first major defeat for the bandits since they entered Guizhou. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>Kunming: After being severely suppressed, the remnant bandits fled towards Mengguan, Shuchang, and Qingyan. Lu Brigade was ordered to pass through Mengguan, Xi Brigade to pass through Baifan, and An Brigade followed Gong Brigade. All pursued and suppressed towards Dingfan. Wu Detachment took a shortcut on the 10th to intercept and suppress towards Anshun. The entire Hunan Army under Li Bao was ordered to advance towards Niuchang from the Huangping-Jiuzhou line.

In this battle, over 1,000 bandits were killed and countless others captured. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>Guiyang: The Guizhou communists clearly lack fighting spirit. Today, 2,000 bandits, all carrying weapons, are fleeing between Longli and Guangshun. They are being pursued by government troops. The bandits do not resist at all and surrender readily. Red Cross personnel, following behind the fleeing communists, reported discovering several seriously wounded communists groaning in shallowly buried graves. This shows that the communists definitely kill those who are too injured to walk, to prevent them from revealing the true situation within the bandit ranks to the authorities. This is because the communists move very quickly and cannot carry the wounded. (Reuters dispatch on the 13th)</p>

<h3>Truth About the Guantai Closure</h3>
<p>Kaifeng: To clarify the truth about the Guantai closure, the reporter personally visited Chenliu Ferry at around 11:00 AM on the morning of the 13th. On the south bank, there were over a thousand large and small vehicles transporting willow branches and stones piled up like mountains. Hundreds of boats in the river were transporting construction materials to the north bank. The breach has indeed been closed, and the current height has been built level with the two embankments, forming a unified structure. Because it is built with willow and stone, water still seeps out from the lower part. People are rushing to dump hemp bags on the back of the river, building closed willow fences and raising the earthen embankments near the river. About 2,000 workers can completely close the breach within two or three days. Everything, including the back earthen embankments, can also be completed within half a month. On the 12th, the width of the water behind the Hua Yang embankment at Guantai was only 30 meters and the depth was less than 1 meter. Siltation is very rapid. The water level in Changyuan has dropped five feet. A total of 419 jujube pit willow stones have been placed inside the Xizheng Dam breach, 374 near the river, and 84 behind the river. 246 have been placed at the edge of the embankment behind the river. At the Dongba Dam breach, 35 have been placed near the river, 9490 near the pillow embankment, and 226 at the edge of the embankment behind the river. As of the 11th, approximately 3.5 million jin of willow, over 1.8 million city squares of stone, over 1.3 million jin of straw, over 88,000 hemp bags, over 191,000 jin of hemp, and 820 bundles of lead wire have been used. Reasons for the rapid closure: (1) Materials are concentrated and command is flexible. (2) The construction of two permeable dams west of the breach is effective. (3) The original silting in the due east of the breach did not allow water to pass, but due to wind scouring, the main flow went east. (4) The success of willow fences provides no cause for worry. (5) The jujube pit willow stones are effective. (6) Disaster victims from Kaifeng, Lanfeng, Puyang, Dongming, Changyuan, Fengqiu, and Huaxian have worked hard. (Special dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Hebei Provincial Government has already allocated 60,092 yuan before and after for the emergency protection of the Taihang Dam and the Yellow River flood control and maintenance expenses. Now that the Guantai closure is complete, the provincial government will successively order the Department of Finance to allocate post-disaster construction funds in batches to the Yellow River Affairs Bureau for application.

<h3>Ministry of Industry to Establish Patent Bureau and Standards Bureau</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Countries around the world always grant patent rights to inventions of industrial technology, and there is also an International Association for the Protection of Industrial Property.

<h3>Military Authorities Stipulate Officer Appointment Procedures, to be Conducted in Two Phases</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The military authorities consider that the number of existing national troops, local units, and officers serving in the political sphere or idle and unemployed is extremely large. Therefore, the officer appointment procedures will be carried out in two phases. The entire national army and a portion of the local units will be in the first phase. The first phase will be divided into three sessions, including officers appointed as Major Generals, Lieutenant Generals, and Brigadier Generals by order of the National Government, ministers and vice ministers of various central departments, and all officers and staff of the 35 divisions of the National Army stationed in various provinces, and all faculty members and students of the Lushan Military Training Corps in the 23rd year. After the first session of appointments is completed, the second and third sessions will also be held sequentially within the year. The local units and unemployed officers will be handled separately by province in the second phase. Furthermore, the officer appointment is a procedure for reorganizing the army. After the officer appointment, only an officer of a certain rank is allowed to hold a position of that rank. For example, a captain can serve as a company commander. In other words, the rank and position must be commensurate. That is, no one can hold a position without a rank. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 14th)</p>

<h3>On Guiding Public Common Sense</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Yat-sen's will states: "The goal of the National Revolution is to seek freedom and equality for China. To achieve this goal, we must awaken the masses." These words should not only be adhered to by revolutionary comrades, but also be regarded as a clear instruction by the general public who have received considerable education. Because in today's nation-building, it is not only a small number of authorities who bear the responsibility of implementing the revolutionary goals. To enrich national strength, it is necessary to base on a healthy majority of the people. After the war, the emerging countries in the world all prioritized public education. That is why.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the National Government in our country, education authorities have been working hard to promote public education. However, due to limited sources of funding, it has not been fully developed. Recently, party and government agencies in various regions have followed the central government's orders to unite with local agencies and organizations to prepare for the establishment of public common sense guidance committees. Judging from the guidance items and methods they have set, it is simply another form of public education. Perhaps the party and government authorities value public education but suffer from economic constraints, so they have this alternative approach. However, those in charge of local people's organizations should also be mindful of the revolutionary mentor's last words and follow the ancient teachings of "establishing oneself and then establishing others." They should strive to do it diligently, and we hereby wish them to achieve practical results in the shortest possible time, creating a deep-rooted foundation for the revolutionary cause.</p>
<p>However, at the beginning of the implementation, there are thousands of things to do, and from where to start is also a question worth considering seriously. We have infinite enthusiasm for this new undertaking and cannot help but forget our ignorance and offer a humble opinion as follows.</p>
<p>Our country is based on agriculture, and 70% to 80% of the people live in rural areas. The majority of the uneducated people are those who engage in agriculture and live in rural areas. Therefore, public common sense guidance work should start from rural areas. Moreover, there are special sections on improving agriculture and sideline handicrafts, and guiding transportation and storage methods. If we can work hard in rural areas, it will greatly benefit the current decline in the rural economy.</p>
<p>The social organization of our country is based on the family due to economic relations. The main members of the family are women, and there are more uneducated women than men. Therefore, the guidance of public common sense should also focus on women. It must be known that the unbreakable superstitions and unhygienic old habits of our society are precisely due to the lack of education for women. Now that the guidance items include instructions on family management and children, as well as publicity on hygiene, it is necessary to put more effort into the women's sector to be effective.</p>
<p>In recent years, various social movements have mostly focused on cities and men. I believe that only the work of guiding public common sense, if you want it to be universal and effective, you must pay more attention to rural areas and women to be successful.</p>
<p>Moreover, "teach after enriching," the ancient sages have said. If you want the public to receive common sense guidance, you should first relieve their difficulties in life. Otherwise, I am afraid that it will be counterproductive. I hope that the wise authorities will pay attention to it.</p>
<h3>Conclusions of the Consul Generals' Conference; Ariyoshi Telegraphs Tokyo; Hirota is the Drafter of the Twenty-One Demands; Future China Policy Worth Watching; Paris to Convene a Conference of Japanese Ambassadors to Europe</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The conference of Japanese consuls general stationed in China, which gave important instructions on the establishment of a new China policy, Regarding the current situation of anti-Japanese sentiment in various parts of China, the crackdown on anti-Japanese sentiment, and the issuance of orders to suppress anti-Japanese sentiment, Ariyoshi telegraphed the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday to report, and will return to the country at the end of April to report to Foreign Minister Hirota in detail, in order to decide on a new strategy for China. (14th Electric Communication)</p>
<p>Tokyo News, Since Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations came into effect, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has started to refresh and reorganize its diplomatic work in order to realize the country's independent economic diplomacy and deal with the naval conference and other issues. Minister to China Ariyoshi received instructions from the Foreign Ministry and held a consul general meeting in Shanghai to discuss economic and commercial affairs with China. The meeting was held from the 8th to the 10th of this month and has ended. After the minister returns to the country, a detailed report will be made. Ambassador to the United Kingdom Matsudaira also received instructions from the Foreign Ministry and will hold a meeting of ambassadors to Europe in Paris in late June before returning to the country. Those attending will include Sato (stationed in France), Matsumura (stationed in Italy), Mushanokōji (stationed in Germany), Tokugawa (stationed in Turkey), and Arita (stationed in Belgium). In addition, due to the League of Nations relations, Ambassador Horita to Switzerland and Consul General Yokoyama in Geneva were summoned. The meeting will last for two weeks to discuss the current situation in Europe centered on England, France, Germany, and Italy, paying particular attention to the turmoil caused by Germany's declaration of compulsory military service. The results of the meeting will be compiled into a report and carried back to the country by Ambassador Matsudaira to report to the Foreign Ministry. Recently, a conference of ambassadors will also be held in South America to discuss issues such as the brisk sales of Japanese goods. Those attending will include Sawada (stationed in Brazil), Murakami (Peru), Iwate (stationed in Colombia), Yano (stationed in Chile), and Yamazaki (stationed in Argentina). (World News Agency)</p>
<p>A foreign commentary agency stated: "The Millard's Review reported that this week, Japanese diplomatic and consular officials stationed in various parts of China, such as Peiping, Tientsin, Hankow, Nanking, Canton, Tsinan, Tsingtao, Shanghai, Foochow, and Amoy, held a three-day meeting in Shanghai. The meeting was chaired by Japanese Minister Ariyoshi. According to news reports, the main issues discussed at the meeting were about suppressing the anti-Japanese sentiments of Chinese people and the boycott of Japanese goods. There was a very important figure at the meeting. Who was this person? It was Yokotake, the Japanese commercial counselor to China, who recently returned to China from Japan. Because when he was in Japan, he had several meetings with Foreign Minister Hirota, and also discussed with leaders of the Japanese business, industry, and finance circles on expanding Japan's commercial influence in China. Minister Ariyoshi, who served as the chairman of the meeting, is preparing to return to Japan soon to report on the current situation in China and the situation of "cooperation" between China and Japan to the Japanese diplomatic authorities.</p>
<p>Because the future China policies of the Japanese military and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are clearly going their separate ways and not seeking each other's advice, it is impossible to determine Japan's second step of action. However, although they are currently pursuing their own goals, if something happens, Japan will only have one national policy and can no longer diverge for a long time. Moreover, this policy will mostly follow the lead of the military. In short, the world-renowned Twenty-One Demands were actually drafted by the current Foreign Minister Hirota. The key point of the current situation is that Japan is striving to dominate within China, while the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is under pressure from its domestic businessmen to help them develop their businesses in China. It is currently paying attention to a policy of compromise. The Japanese military is obstructing the unification of China and has no policy other than provoking resentment between the Ning and Yue factions."</p>
<h3>Taiwan Government Plans to Develop Immigration to Southern China; Organizes a Colonization Committee; Drafts Concrete Plans</h3>

<h3>Dutch East Indies Restricts Japanese Goods; Japanese Merchants Decide on Countermeasures; Strengthen the Functions of Various Export Associations; Urge the Government to Establish Export Rights</h3>
<p>Osaka The Dutch East Indies government issued a restriction order on seven kinds of goods on January 21 this year, but it was not until recently that it began to implement a distribution system for bicycles and enameled ironware. However, the distribution of Japanese goods is actually only about 10%, and only one-third of other Japanese goods are distributed, and many have not yet indicated a distribution system. In order to cope with this situation, the Japan-Dutch East Indies Trade Association convened a temporary general meeting at the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry on the 13th to discuss the results, and decided to take the following two methods to cope with it: (1) Report the actual situation to the government and establish the export rights of Japanese people in accordance with the Trade Protection Law, in order to counter the import rights of the Dutch East Indies; (2) Strive to strengthen the functions of various export unions and take concerted action. In order to implement the above countermeasures, the General Association of Sundry Goods Exports to the Dutch East Indies, which was drafted by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, should be established as soon as possible in order to promote it.

<h3>Japan Criticizes U.S. Commercial Policy; Washington Feels Very Strange</h3>
<p>(Washington) Japanese newspapers have launched a large-scale attack on the commercial policy of the United States, which is clearly a hint from the officialdom. U.S. government leaders are very surprised by this. Moreover, when President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull spoke with the governors of several New England states yesterday, they had already expressed goodwill to Japan. President Roosevelt said that Japan's exports of cotton textiles to the United States are like a drop in the bucket compared with the total output of the United States. Therefore, if Japanese goods do not pose a significant danger to domestic production, the government does not intend to limit them. Moreover, there is no problem at present. Hull also stated that the commercial relations between the United States and Japan are very good compared with other countries. Government officials stated again today that no country has any reason to believe that the United States is encouraging anti-Japanese actions in Latin America. Some officials have privately stated that Tokyo's attack must have been drafted before hearing the statements of the U.S. authorities. Some experts believe that the United States is also trying to avoid hindering Japanese goods in the Philippines. Officials generally feel that the trade relations between Japan and the United States are very good, so they feel very confused about Japan's attitude. (13th National Press)</p>

Ordinary commercial drafts are now unrestricted, and foreigners are also able to freely buy and sell stocks and bonds. The financial community has a lot of discussion about the reasons for the Belgian government's abolition of the gold clause in private contracts. The government also admits that the previous gold clause has always been valid, but in view of the current extraordinary situation, it has to be abolished for the sake of national interests.

<h3>Belgium Imitates U.S. Blue Eagle Movement; Promotes Industrial and Commercial Revival</h3>
<p>Beiping The government has recently decided to give a kind of mark (stamp or small poster) to each producer, distributor, and retailer, but they must take it from the official office by themselves, so as to show that they have morally accepted the restraint and must not raise prices without reason. Those who do not comply with this restraint, the official office will take back the mark to show punishment. According to this decision of the Belgian government, it is actually in harmony with the U.S. Blue Eagle Movement, which is used to show compliance with the recovery regulations.

Japanese representative Shimura agreed with the British proposal, but said that Japan must make reservations on this, because Japan is willing to establish a convention that can be accepted by all countries, and stated that the Japanese government is willing to continue to sincerely cooperate with the Disarmament Committee.

<h3>Final Communiqué - Divided into Two Parts</h3>
<p>Stresa - The final communiqué of the Stresa Conference was released this afternoon. This is a joint resolution of the conference, divided into two parts, as mentioned in previous telegrams. The representatives of England, France, and Italy, based on the exchange of views among the powers weeks ago regarding the German government's decision on March 16, and the information obtained by British cabinet members during their recent travels to European capitals, studied the general European situation. After considering the relationship of this situation to the policies agreed upon in Rome and London, they realized that their opinions were completely consistent regarding the various events discussed.</p>
<p>(1) When discussing the French government's request to the League of Nations Administrative Council, a common line of action should be adopted. (2) The information they received confirmed their view that negotiations should be conducted to seek Eastern European security. (3) The representatives of the three countries re-examined the Austrian situation and reiterated the declarations issued on September 27, 1934, and February 17, 1935, by the British, French, and Italian governments, recognizing the need to maintain Austria's independence and integrity. In the future, these three countries will continue to use this as their common policy. Regarding the Franco-Italian Protocol of January 7, 1935, and the Anglo-French Declaration of February 3, which reiterated their decision to consult each other on how to deal with the threat to Austria's independence and integrity, the representatives of the three countries now agree to suggest that governments related to this agreement should send representatives to meet in Rome as soon as possible to establish a Central European Agreement. (4) Regarding the proposed Western European Air Convention, the representatives of the three countries recognized the principle of procedures to be adopted as stated in the London communiqué of February 3, and agreed to continue actively studying this issue, in order to draft a convention among the five powers mentioned in the London communiqué, and any additional bilateral agreements. (5) When dealing with the issue of armaments, the representatives of the three countries recalled the London communiqué stating that an agreement was to be freely negotiated with Germany to replace the provisions of Chapter V of the Treaty of Versailles. They also recorded their careful consideration of the German government's recent actions and the report of British Foreign Secretary Simon's conversation with German leader Hitler. At a time when efforts were being made to promote a free negotiation solution to the arms reduction issue, Germany adopted unilateral cancellation methods, thereby undermining public trust in the safety of the peaceful order. This is what the representatives of the three countries had to acknowledge. Moreover, the scope of the German-announced rearmament program, which is now underway, is broad enough to destroy the assumptions on which arms reduction efforts are based and to shake the hope from which these efforts arise. However, the representatives of the three countries reiterated their sincere desire to establish security concepts to maintain peace, and therefore declared that they are eager to participate in various feasible efforts to promote international agreements to limit armaments. (6) The representatives of the three countries have considered the desire of countries whose military status is stipulated by treaties to revise this status. The representatives of the three countries decided that such desires should be notified to other relevant countries. The representatives of the three countries diplomatically encourage other related countries to study this issue, in order to seek solutions through mutual compromise within the scope of general or partial security guarantees. As for the Treaty of Versailles, the representatives of England and Italy issued a joint declaration as follows: England and Italy participate in the Locarno Treaty only as guarantors, and their representatives now formally re-acknowledge the various obligations under this treaty, and declare their intention to faithfully fulfill these obligations when needed. This joint declaration will be formally notified to the governments of Belgium and Germany. (7) The policy of the British, French, and Italian countries is to unite within the scope of the League of Nations to maintain peace. Now they agree with each other to oppose any unilateral cancellation of treaties by various feasible methods, so as not to endanger European peace, and are willing to cooperate closely to achieve this goal. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Stresa - The official communiqué after the close of the Stresa Conference has just been released, divided into three sections as follows:</p>
<p>The first section stated that the British, French, and Italian countries expressed their firm determination to complete the collective security system, and pointed out that if any country competes for hegemony without mutual contact, it will inevitably fall into serious divergence.</p>
<p>The second section is divided into seven items: (A) The British, French, and Italian countries reiterate the various obligations in the Locarno Treaty. (B) This conference examined the conclusion of the universal air mutual assistance convention proposed in the London Declaration of February 3. Germany can participate in this convention, but with conditions, that is, Germany must cooperate with the collective security system in the form of a mutual assistance convention. The communiqué also stated that after this plan is realized, there will be no need for bilateral air conventions between England and France, France and Italy, or England and Italy. (C) It is planned to convene a conference of Danube countries at the end of May to negotiate a Central European Convention. (D) The three-country conference believes that past efforts regarding the Eastern European Convention should be completed. (E) The issue of rearmament in Central European countries should only be resolved through joint consultation by the countries within the scope of regional security organizations. (F) Expressing hope that Germany will return to Geneva and declaring the moral conditions it should possess. (G) Acknowledging that Germany's cooperation is very beneficial for maintaining peace and limiting armaments. The last section of the communiqué stated, "The policies of the British, French, and Italian countries are all aimed at maintaining collective peace within the scope of the League of Nations. Therefore, it has been fully agreed that when a unilateral abandonment of a treaty endangers European peace, various appropriate methods should be adopted to deal with it. In the event of such situations, the British, French, and Italian countries should seek close and sincere cooperation." (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>Compromises Reached by the Three Countries</p>
<p>Stresa - The conference of representatives from England, France, and Italy will conclude at 10:00 this morning after the representatives have put the agreed-upon points into written form. The British side is very satisfied with the results of this conference. It is heard that a document has been drafted, divided into seven items, including the following four items contained in the Anglo-French London Communiqué of February 3:</p>
<p>(1) Declaration on the discussion of the Air Convention. (2) Central European Convention. (3) Eastern European Convention. (4) Germany's return to the League of Nations. The other three items not listed in the London Communiqué include the rearmament issue of Hungary, Austria, and Bulgaria. It is heard that the document sent by the Little Entente countries to the conference regarding Hungary's rearmament will likely not be accepted by Hungary. It states that Hungary cannot be allowed to rearm while it is plotting to revise its borders.</p>
<p>The British side did not issue a communiqué last night, which was unexpected, because it was decided at the meeting that all news would not be announced temporarily, but would wait for the final communiqué to be released today. All the points contained in the Anglo-French Protocol of February 3 were discussed at the meeting, and other matters were also involved. Details will be included in the communiqué to be released today.</p>
<p>Opinions are Closer</p>
<p>In addition to reaching practical compromises on certain points, the three countries of England, France, and Italy are also closer to each other on other events. As a result of the discussion, France and Italy decided to prepare to conclude a short agreement to guarantee Austria's independence. England and Italy agreed to support France's appeal to the League of Nations regarding Germany's re-implementation of compulsory military service, and Britain will try to persuade Germany to return to the League of Nations. The German government is now also willing to participate in the Eastern European Convention. The representatives of the three countries met from 9:30 AM to 1:00 PM yesterday, and then from 4:00 PM to 7:30 PM in the evening. When discussing the Air Convention yesterday, it was heard that France advocated the immediate conclusion of a three-country agreement, but Britain's opinion was that a comprehensive solution should be made to the various issues mentioned in the London Communiqué of February 3, and it should not be done piecemeal.

<p>Date of the Nine-Nation Conference</p>

France, Poland, and Romania will also be invited, and the United Kingdom and Switzerland will send personnel to attend as observers.

The continuation of the Arms Reduction Conference was also one of the most important issues yesterday. According to reliable sources, the United Kingdom supports reconvening it, while France advocates changing it to a Security Conference. As for the rearmament issue of Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria, Mussolini enthusiastically supported it. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>
<h3>French Representative Delivers Broadcast Speech - The Unity of the Three Countries Seeks Peace - Justice Will Ultimately Triumph over Might</h3>
<p>Stresa - French Foreign Minister Laval, before departing from here to Geneva, gave a radio broadcast speech, stating briefly, "The Stresa Conference has now come to an end. Our consultations this time were conducted with a spirit of frankness, sincerity, and integrity. All that we have considered and sought is nothing other than maintaining peace. The international policy implemented by our French and British and Italian allies has absolutely no intention of opposing any other country. We demand that all countries gain security, and we sincerely wish to make necessary reconciliation with all nations." Following him, French Prime Minister Flandin spoke, stating briefly, "The ancients said, 'Peace is a continuous and unceasing creation.' However, this alone is still insufficient. Peace can be expected only when the moral strength of the world is supported by material strength. Today, the three countries of England, France, and Italy are united in spirit and their material strength is incomparably strong. The whole world can henceforth be sheltered without fear." Flandin then thanked Mussolini for the hospitality, and finally said, "If new difficulties occur in Europe by any chance, the resolute and close cooperation of the three governments will surely be able to find ways to eliminate them, because the people represented by these three governments all have a common aspiration, that is, to make justice triumph over might in international relations."

<h3>French Memorandum to the League of Nations Published - Accuses Germany of Violating the Treaty - Unilateral Actions Endanger International Order - Requests the League of Nations to Take Appropriate Measures - The Administrative Council Will Meet Today to Discuss It</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The French memorandum to the League of Nations, protesting Germany's decision to rearm, is quite stern, stating that international events have somehow reached a point where the method of fait accompli is replacing the method of negotiation. Germany's implementation of compulsory military service and the creation of an air force are concrete actions that violate the basic provisions of Chapter V of the Treaty of Versailles. If the method of unilaterally canceling international obligations is adopted by the masses, then soon there will be no room for any other policy except force. It asks the League of Nations to deliberate on appropriate plans to remedy this situation and prevent emulation. It also says that Germany's secret violation of the treaty has long been beyond doubt, but now it is doing so openly and undeniably. The League of Nations cannot remain indifferent to political means that directly violate the principles upon which the League of Nations was founded, and allow them to run rampant. Germany deliberately undermines its foundation for cooperation with the League of Nations, and hinders the success of the Geneva arms reduction negotiations. If the unilateral cancellation of contractual obligations does not result in other consequences other than moral condemnation, then is it worth for peace-loving countries to continue to establish non-aggression and mutual consultation and mutual assistance conventions? If the League of Nations Administrative Council wants to fulfill its responsibilities, it can no longer ignore the serious harm to international order. This document will be considered at a special meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council tomorrow. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French government's application to the League of Nations Administrative Council regarding Germany's violation of the treaty and rearmament has just been released. The application states, "Germany has abandoned the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles and has been secretly rearming for a long time. In addition to the procedures currently adopted, military expenditures in Germany's five-year budget have greatly increased. Germany plans to reorganize the national defense forces into a short-term conscription system, hence this is necessary. In addition, it denies that the aviation department's budget is a military budget. An examination reveals that Germany's current military system cannot be achieved within a few months. From this, the true meaning of the above denial and declaration by the German government has been revealed, and its long-term considerations are even more noteworthy. The application also states, "Germany regards the treaty clauses regulating the German military system as waste paper, and it is intentionally destroying a foundation for German cooperation with the Geneva organization. As for France, it has previously striven to limit armaments, and has already recognized Germany's equality in armaments rights. After the European War, France reduced the term of military service from three years to one year. The recent decision to temporarily extend the term of military service to two years is actually due to the shortage of new recruits. This measure by France was deemed legitimate by the preparatory committee of the Arms Reduction Conference five years ago. Now Germany wants to solve international problems by unilateral decisions. It is well known that Germany's decision will inevitably lead to the problem of general rearmament. If the League of Nations Administrative Council ignores this threat to international order, then the Administrative Council will not be able to fulfill its mission in the future. Therefore, considering the most appropriate measures to deal with this threat from Germany, on the one hand, to remedy the situation that has already been created, and on the other hand, to prevent such things from happening again, is the responsibility of the League of Nations Administrative Council." (Havas, 14th)</p>
<h3>Key Figures from Various Countries Gather in Geneva - Litvinov Conducts Diplomatic Activities</h3>

British Foreign Secretary Simon, French Foreign Minister Laval, and Italian Representative Aloisi will arrive tonight. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<h3>The German Government Clarifies its Attitude Towards Eastern Europe - Believes that Military Mutual Assistance Supplementary Clauses are Mutually Contradictory in Public Opinion</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Yesterday, the German authorities issued a long communiqué clarifying Germany's attitude towards the Eastern European Convention, and declaring that the German government cannot participate in conventions containing military obligations contained in existing bilateral and multilateral military agreements. However, Germany will not therefore not conclude non-aggression treaties with other countries. The communiqué stated that it is self-contradictory to supplement non-aggression treaties or suggestions to reject violence with military assistance obligations. If people believe that they should voluntarily assume obligations, why should they sign such military agreements? If there are doubts about a country's sincerity in complying with non-aggression obligations, then there must be similar doubts about its faithful fulfillment of supplementary military obligations in such peace treaties. If non-aggression treaties still have the possibility of war, then self-defense and mutual assistance agreements must also have the possibility of aggressive actions. However, the German government does not see in this kind of European military alliance will any element of collective peaceful development, let alone the guarantee of peace. Therefore, the German government cannot sign conventions with such obligations as an important part. The communiqué also stated that during the recent meeting between the German leader and British Foreign Secretary Simon, it was stated that Germany could not participate in the current form of the Eastern European Convention, but Germany is prepared to agree to a collective security convention with non-aggression mutual and general obligations as its main purpose, and stipulating that other signatory countries should take consultation procedures when any signatory disturbs peace. Hitler also clearly stated the difficulty of identifying aggressors, and the German government's willingness to participate in all plans that do not assist such aggressors. The German government still maintains this attitude today. During the discussions in Berlin, Hitler also stated that the German government cannot accept any convention or suggestion in which all or individual members have a limited degree of automatic obligation, because it feels that such conventions do not contain any factors for maintaining peace. The communiqué concluded by saying that the current German government has expressed its willingness to conclude non-aggression treaties with its neighbors since taking power. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<h3>A Two-Sided View of Germany's Perverted Behavior</h3>
<p>Warsaw - After the news that the German government expressed its willingness to participate in the Eastern European Non-Aggression Pact reached here, general public opinion was quite surprised, believing that the reason for Germany's sudden change of attitude was that the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the National Defense Army were deeply afraid of Germany being isolated. The Polish opposition party believes that this move is a German tactic, intending to break through the encirclement of Germany by the great powers, so as to delay time and seize opportunities to make Germany's military preparations even greater. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<h3>Copy of German Dispatch Delivered to Poland</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Foreign Minister Neurath yesterday sent a dispatch to the British Embassy, declaring Germany's willingness to sign the Eastern European Non-Aggression Pact. The Foreign Minister also gave a copy of this dispatch to Polish Ambassador to Germany Lipski, and supplemented it with explanations from the German perspective. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Prevents German Divisive Tactics</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Officials believe that the news of Germany's change of attitude (referring to the country's preparation to sign the Eastern European Non-Aggression Pact) is "interesting, but not unexpected." They believe that Germany only knows that a strong policy is still important. Now that France and Russia have resolutely established an agreement, it is now seeing the wind and steering the rudder. It is especially feared that this approach by Germany is intended to alienate peace-loving countries, so it is necessary to guard against it. In addition, officials expressed their happiness for the British approval of the French-Russian agreement, and regarding rumors that Soviet Russia had made suggestions to Lithuania (referring to the Soviet Union's request that the country join the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact), they seemed to know nothing. However, it is generally recognized that this kind of suggestion does not deviate from the scope of Soviet Russian policy. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<h3>The Little Entente Voices Support for France and Russia</h3>
<p>Czech Capital - After Germany announced its preparation to sign the Eastern European Non-Aggression Pact, responsible officials here believe that there may be concrete progress in European reconciliation. However, the reason for Germany's change of attitude is unknown and cannot be judged. France is now prepared to cooperate closely with the Soviet Union (referring to the imminent signing of an agreement between France and Russia). The reason why the German government changed its course may be here, and it is not necessarily certain. The Czech side believes that close cooperation between France and Russia is a necessary condition for maintaining peace. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<h3>British and Italian Representatives Discuss Outside of the Meeting the Matter of the Eastern Bandits - The Mediation Committee Will Meet in Cairo</h3>

These nomadic tribes are mostly armed, and every year they must migrate from British Somaliland to Abyssinia and Italian Somaliland at a certain time, which is most likely to cause disputes. The solution belongs to a specialized issue, and is related to the border lines of the three countries of England, Italy, and Abyssinia. The actions of today's meeting are sufficient to arouse interest, because of this. (Havas, 13th)</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Letter to Shantou Municipal Government: Banning Illegal Voyages to Siam</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After the implementation of immigration laws, unscrupulous merchants are taking the opportunity to profit.

The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission believes this practice is not only illegal, but once discovered, will be severely punished, and urges methods to ban it. Recently, the Penang Consulate reported that a certain ship from Shantou to Siam, due to strict inspection by the Immigration Bureau, resulted in more than a dozen passengers hiding in the water tank drowning, and more than a dozen suffocating in the coal bunker.

<h3>Japan's Existing Air Force and Expansion Plan</h3>
<p>After the adjournment of the Japanese Diet, it was followed by the comedy of welcoming Puyi. The major Japanese newspapers have treated this as a particularly important matter, and many government officials have been unusually busy as a result. Those of us who are out of step in foreign lands feel greatly inconvenienced and must be especially careful in our actions. Although the Japanese government seems able to use Puyi's visit to make its people forget some of the domestic political contradictions, people from all parties, from left to right, throughout Japan, as well as the media, still say that the Okada cabinet is a "weak cabinet" and are largely dissatisfied with it. Although there is such a situation in Japanese politics, they are very enthusiastic about military preparations. The Divisional Commanders' Conference was convened at the beginning of the month, with the main task of strengthening the power of command and rejecting European and American constitutional political theories. In addition, they are paying close attention to the expansion of the air force. Japan's existing air force strength, in terms of the army, has eleven reconnaissance aircraft squadrons, eleven fighter aircraft squadrons, and four bomber squadrons, divided into eight regiments, with approximately 900 aircraft. There is one airfield in Pyongyang, Korea, and one in Pingtung, Taiwan. Within Japan, airfields have been established in Tokorozawa, Tachikawa, Shimoshizu, Hamamatsu, Kagamigahara, Akeno, Yokaichi, and Tachiarai. These airfields are mostly equipped for night landings and have hangars for storing aircraft, and there are strong air defense facilities nearby, such as anti-aircraft gun positions and barrage balloons. There are four army flying schools: Tokorozawa teaches piloting, Shimoshizu Flying School teaches reconnaissance, Akeno teaches fighter aircraft, and Hamamatsu teaches bombing. The navy is mainly based on aircraft carriers, with 31 squadrons currently, and the second replenishment of eight squadrons is not yet completed. There are approximately 900 aircraft. Airfields are located in Ominato, Kashiwaura, Yokosuka, Tateyama, Kure, Saiki, Omura, and Sasebo. The navy does not have dedicated aviation schools, but there are specially established aviation training classes in Kashiwaura and Yokosuka. The army has three aircraft factories, and the navy also has three. They now seem to feel that the air force strength is still weak, fearing that it will be insufficient to cope with strong enemies once a war breaks out. Therefore, this year's budget includes 48.3 million yuan for reforming the army's aviation. They are preparing to add two aviation schools, one is the Army Aviation Technical School, and the other is the Army Junior Aviation School. They are adding three flying regiments, one in the central part of the main island, one in northern Korea, and one in Hokkaido (or the Hokuriku region). They want to gradually replace the existing aircraft with new aircraft with a range of more than 2,500 kilometers. Their main hypothetical enemies are undoubtedly the United States and the Soviet Union. In short, although Japanese politics are somewhat unstable and the economy is also somewhat unstable, they are very active in military preparations. (April 4th, in Tokyo)</p>
<h3>Puppet Organization Absorbs Tianjin East's Cash and Vigorously Promotes Counterfeit Money</h3>
<p>Tianjin dispatch: In the past two weeks, the financial community in eastern Tianjin has been in great panic due to the absorption of cash by the puppet organization, resulting in a lack of cash. Although banks and silver firms have restricted the exchange of banknotes, cash is still flowing out continuously and cannot be returned in small amounts. At the same time, counterfeit Manchurian Central Bank banknotes issued by the Japanese puppets are flooding the cities and towns in the Jixian, Miyun, and Yu counties, almost becoming the dominant currency, so that everywhere the currency used is counterfeit banknotes, and exchange coupons from China and other banks have fallen behind. The Shanhaiguan Public Security Bureau and the Tangshan Public Security Bureau have successively issued notices prohibiting travelers from carrying more than 50 yuan in cash out of the pass. However, smugglers, for the sake of great profit, still do not restrain themselves. The Tangshan Public Security Bureau has specially set up inspection stations at railway stations, and all passengers leaving the pass by train from the area are inspected. The Shanhaiguan Public Security Bureau has also stipulated five inspection methods and reissued a notice a few days ago stating that any traveler wishing to carry 50 yuan in cash must have a permit issued by the local government, which must be presented for inspection. Those without a permit, or those with a permit whose cash exceeds the prescribed amount, will have their cash confiscated and punished. Enforcement seems to be stricter than before, but the panic over the lack of cash in various places has not diminished. Affected by this, businesses and farmers are feeling the difficulty of turnover, and the general public believes that with the encroachment of the economic forces of the puppet organization into the pass, the future will be even more difficult to imagine. Therefore, some merchants and residents in Yu County and Tangshan have specially telegraphed the Civil Affairs Department, requesting a new, stricter method to limit the outflow of cash, so that the cash will not flow out and the economic source will not be exhausted. It is reported that the Civil Affairs Department will submit this matter for discussion at the provincial government's regular meeting on Friday, and a decision may be made. Currently, the areas with the most severe shortage of cash are Tanggu, Lutai, Tangshan, Kaiping, Guye, Luan County, Changli, Liushuying, Shanhaiguan, and Qinhuangdao. There is almost no cash in circulation in the market, with counterfeit banknotes accounting for eight-tenths and national currency only two-tenths. According to an investigation by the responsible agency, the flow of cash to the Northeast is caused by the puppet organization's efforts to absorb it. The puppet organization, in the past six months, due to the high exchange rate, shortage of cash, and sharp drop in the price of banknotes, has been unable to obtain assistance because Japan is a gold standard country. Therefore, the puppet Central Bank planned to exchange our cash for counterfeit banknotes and vigorously promoted the use of counterfeit banknotes in eastern Luan County to exchange for our cash in order to consolidate the puppet financial system. At first, the exchange was only carried out in Yu County, Qinhuangdao, and Tangshan, but later, due to the depletion of cash in these areas, unscrupulous merchants and vendors were hired, baited with heavy profits, and bought cash everywhere. These unscrupulous merchants and vendors all disguised themselves as farmers to avoid the attention of the government. Each person bought hundreds of yuan or several hundred yuan per day. Some unscrupulous money shops, greedy for profit, are also willing to buy cash on behalf of the puppet organization. As a result, the number of unscrupulous merchants and vendors smuggling back and forth between Yu County and Qinhuangdao is endless. The puppet Central Bank has an office in the East Luocheng of Shanhaiguan to provide support, and the cash bought is packed in boxes by the office and handed over to Japanese military vehicles with flag markings, labeled as military supplies, and transported out of Shanhaiguan to Wanjia Tun, then loaded onto trains and sent to Shenyang. The amount transported each day is always more than 60,000 or 70,000 yuan. At present, the cash in Tangdong has been bought up, and the traitors have further sneaked into Tianjin to buy and smuggle it. For smuggling, each person makes a cotton waistcoat with more than 20 hidden pockets sewn into it. The cash is loaded into the pockets and worn next to the skin. If the inspectors at each station are not careful, they will pass through. Even if they are discovered, these people have special abilities to bribe their way through. The provincial government has heard about this and has ordered the Tianjin Public Security Bureau to pay attention to inspections. The bureau will also add several female police officers in the near future to prevent women from smuggling cash. They will be assigned to stations to specialize in inspection duties, to supplement the areas where male inspection personnel are unable to reach. (11th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Bandit Alarms After Security Team Withdrawal</h3>
<p>After the giant bandit Taibao Ashu wreaked havoc in Punan Xinjie Town in the past, the town was repeatedly looted, and the villagers were unable to live and work in peace. In the winter defense conference of the county government two years ago, it was decided that the security team stationed at Jiangzhuang and Dianshan. Since then, troops from both places have shuttled back and forth day and night, alternating to the town without interruption. The bandits initially retreated slightly, and the villagers were able to rely on it for tranquility. But since the Zhuang security team was ordered to withdraw last month, there is only one patrol in Dianshan. Because the team's jurisdiction is far away, although they patrol the district every night, the time is inevitably reduced, and the bandits have taken the opportunity to rise again. The home of Jiang Lanbo on the west side of Xinjie Town was robbed on the night of April 1, and on the night of the 4th, the home of the wealthy villager Cao Fusheng was also robbed. Cao's daughter was about to get married, and all the clothes and jewelry prepared for her were robbed, resulting in a significant loss.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Security Teams from Eight Counties Combined into Infantry Regiment</h3>
<p>The annual general inspection of the security teams from Wuxi, Wujin, Wuxian, Wujiang, Changshu, Kunshan, Taicang, and Jiangyin counties in the Second District was originally scheduled to be held in Wuxi in mid-May. Because there was no suitable venue, it was decided to change it to Wuxian. Supervisor Bai Zhujun yesterday specially summoned the security team leaders from the above counties to a meeting in Wuxi to discuss the inspection method. It was decided that the security teams from the eight counties would be combined into three battalions of an infantry regiment, with Gao Zonghan as the regimental commander and Zhang Pinquan as the regimental deputy. Wuxian, Wujiang, and Taicang will be the first battalion, led by He Linchun as the battalion commander; Wuxi, Wujin, and Jiangyin will be the second battalion, led by Xu Yi as the battalion commander; and Changshu and Kunshan will be the third battalion, led by Liu Ao as the battalion commander. The chief inspector will be Bai Zhujun.</p>
<h3>Roaming Woman Shot Dead</h3>
<p>Yao Jiran, a resident of Dongjie in Hudai Town, Fu'an Township, Fourth District, is currently the captain of the first squad of the 33rd branch of the town's merchant corps. He has one wife and one concubine. His wife, Xi Shi, has two sons. The concubine, named Xi Adai (alias Fan Adai), is 35 years old. Adai is naturally romantic and likes to gamble. In February of this year, she gave birth to a daughter, who died after four days. Last night, Adai and Jiran slept in the same bed. At 6:30 the next morning, Adai woke up first. With a slight noise, Jiran also woke up from his dream, but saw Adai with her head covered in fresh blood, gushing out. The pistol fell on the quilt on her chest. After fifteen minutes, she died. Inspecting the gunshot wound, it entered from the right temple and exited from the back of the head. A bullet casing was also found on the bed. According to Yao Jiran, the pistol was issued by the team. Recently, due to the abolition of winter defense, he placed the pistol under the pillow. It is feared that Adai accidentally pulled the trigger, causing the bullet to be fired and causing her death. Yesterday (14th) morning, Yao Jiran, accompanied by Tu Zheng Yang Xilong, came to the city to report to the local court's procuratorate, requesting an autopsy.</p>

<h3>Jiangyin: Fish Tax Donations Ordered to be Exempted by the Hall</h3>
<p>The Salvation Institute collected donations from fish firms for yellow croaker. Last year, the provincial hall exempted petty taxes. This county's fish merchants submitted a request for exemption, which was approved. However, Chen Jingxin, the local head of donation collection, is still collecting from fish firms this year. The Fish Industry Association, believing that this clearly violates the provincial order, submitted a petition to the Finance Hall, requesting the county to exempt them. The Finance Hall, based on the petition, immediately ordered County Magistrate Yan to handle the matter, stating that the fish donation involves petty taxes and is not convenient to collect, and ordered him to comply.</p>

Zhao explained Hou's unreasonable behavior, but Hou rushed over. Fortunately, Chief Han stopped him and protected Zhao out of the bureau, avoiding harm. Zhao, feeling insulted for no reason, specially requested the Jiangdu Daily Association and the Journalists Association to uphold justice through a letter from the bureau. All reporters in the county also feel endangered. The Daily Association has scheduled an emergency meeting on the 14th to discuss countermeasures.</p>

<h3>America Further Raises Silver Price; Kong Discusses Balancing Tax as Sufficient; Soong Tzu-wen Hosts Banquet for Foreign Banking Community; Kong to Convene Meeting with Financial Circles Today</h3>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, the United States' continued increase in the price of silver has aroused serious attention from all sectors of our country. Yesterday afternoon, in addition to the Chairman of the Bank of China, Mr. Soong Tzu-wen, hosting a non-official meeting with the banking community of various countries including the UK, US, France, and Japan in this city to discuss the issue of silver prices and cooperation between Chinese and foreign banks, Finance Minister Kong will convene a meeting with financial circles today to exchange opinions. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Soong Residence Banquet</p>
<p>Yesterday at 1 PM, the Chairman of the Bank of China, Mr. Soong Tzu-wen, hosted a banquet at his residence on Qi Qi Road for the banking community of various countries including the UK, US, France, and Japan in this city to discuss all matters. Those present included: the General Manager of HSBC, Hutchison; the Manager of Mercantile Bank, Muir; the Manager of Chartered Bank, Mowll; the Manager of Citibank, Mackay; the Manager of Banque de l'Indochine, Chauffard; the Manager of Mitsubishi Bank, Yoshida; and the Manager of Mitsui Bank, Sato, and others, a total of eight individuals. The banquet concluded at 2:30 PM. However, according to the Central News Agency, Mr. Soong Tzu-wen took advantage of the Sunday holiday to hold a family dinner at his private residence on Qi Qi Road at noon yesterday. Only relatives were in attendance, and there were no foreign guests. The rumor that Mr. Soong hosted a banquet for foreign bankers this afternoon to discuss the silver issue is a misrepresentation.</p>
<p>Kong's Remarks</p>
<p>When interviewed by reporters yesterday morning, Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi stated that the government has already determined countermeasures in response to the United States' raising of the silver price. When the United States first raised the silver price, our country immediately implemented a balancing tax to restrict speculation and prevent the outflow of silver. This time, with the United States raising the silver price again, the balancing tax is still sufficient to cope with the situation. However, considering the relationship with various domestic industries and businesses, the government is not in a position to suddenly increase the balancing tax rate to avoid being affected. Therefore, the government is now proceeding cautiously in accordance with the actual situation. As for the ban on the export of northern silver, the government has no intention of doing so because of the establishment of the balancing tax. Furthermore, foreign banks have indicated that they will definitely not transport silver for export for speculation or other profit-making attempts to disrupt the financial system.</p>
<p>Today's Meeting</p>
<p>In addition, Kong also stated that he originally intended to go to Nanjing yesterday, but has now changed his plans to leave Shanghai tonight to facilitate convening leaders from the financial and industrial/commercial sectors in this city this afternoon to study the silver issue and methods for rescuing industries and businesses.</p>
<h3>Money Trade Association Notice: Accommodating Loans Maturing at the End of April; Accepting Commercial Acceptance Drafts</h3>
<p>As the long-term industrial and commercial credit loans in Shanghai will be due at the end of April, the Money Trade Association yesterday notified all members to accommodate loans or collateral loans that are due. Regarding commercial acceptance drafts, they should be accepted as much as possible. The notices are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Notice One</p>
<p>To Whom It May Concern: Regarding the letter from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce stating that on the 5th of this month, they received a letter from the China Industrial and Commercial Relief Association stating, "According to Shanghai's commercial practice, factories and businesses often have fixed-term loan or collateral loan arrangements (commonly known as long-term loans) with silver houses during major settlement periods. The term is mostly three months. Calculating the time, they are about to expire. At this time of extreme social and economic panic, factories and shops feel unable to fulfill their debts that are about to expire. If the silver houses are bound by old habits and strictly demand repayment, the market will become more panic-stricken. It seems that your association is planning to stabilize people's minds in many ways. It is the opinion of the members of our association that before the announcement and implementation of small credit loans and mortgage loans, all loans or collateral loans that are about to expire should be accommodated to avoid forcing industries and businesses to be forced, and the market situation will become unbearable. We dare to ask you to forward this to the Silver Trade Association for review and handling. We will be grateful for your reply," etc. The association submitted this to the 37th executive committee meeting of the second session on the 10th of this month for discussion. It was agreed that long-term credit, which is now expiring, whether returned, rolled over, or newly released, each shop has already considered the situation and handled it as usual. Now, the letter is recorded and notified to the members of the association and recorded in the file. Hereby, the letter is delivered and requested to be considered. Please acknowledge this.</p>
<p>Notice Two</p>
<p>To Whom It May Concern: Regarding the proposal of the 37th Executive Committee meeting of the second session on the 10th of this month, regarding the case of the Silk and Satin Industry Association's discussion of commercial acceptance drafts, after detailed discussion, it was decided that the principle should be approved and forwarded to all industry colleagues. All businesses that have dealings should accept the above drafts as much as possible and record them in the file. Hereby, the case is delivered and requested to be examined. Please acknowledge this.</p>
<h3>The Central Propaganda Committee Convened a Film Industry Symposium in Shanghai Yesterday; Chairman Ye Chucang Reported Two Key Points; Important Issues Regarding Domestic Films Were Discussed</h3>
<p>The Central Propaganda Committee, to promote the advancement of China's film industry, convened a symposium of the domestic film industry last year. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, a second symposium of film company executives was convened at the Shanghai United Amusement Club in the Silk Industry Bank Building on Sanma Road to discuss various issues related to domestic films. Chairman Ye Chucang of the Committee and Secretary Fang Zhi of the Central Propaganda Committee, among others, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing by overnight express the night before to preside over and attend the meeting. A reporter from the Central News Agency attended and observed the symposium yesterday and filed the following report.</p>
<p>Attendees</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM yesterday, the attendees included Chairman Ye Chucang of the Central Propaganda Committee, key members of the Central Organization Department and the Central Propaganda Department such as Fang Zhi, Luo Gang, Chen Jianxiao, Dai Ce, Zhang Chong, Lu Juewu, Guo Youshou, Chen Kecheng representing the Municipal Government, Huang E representing the Municipal Party Headquarters, and representatives from various domestic film companies, including Jin Qingyu, Tao Bosun, Wu Bangfan, Sun Yu, Fei Mu, Li Minwei, and He Mengfu from Lianhua Film Company; Zhang Shichuan, Zheng Zhengqiu, Xu Xinfu, Cheng Bugao, Wu Cun, Li Pingqian, Gao Zhanfei, Dong Keyi, Ying Yunwei, and Ma Tangna from Mingxing Film Company; Shao Cunren, Gao Tianqi, Gao Lihen, and Wen Yimin from Tianyi Film Company; Ma Dejian, Situ Yimin, Xu Xingzhi, and Yuan Muzhi from Diantong Film Company; Zhang Shankun and Ouyang Yuqian from Xinhua Film Company; Wu Wenchao from Jixing Film Company; Zhang Bingsheng from Kuaihuolin Film Company; Tang Jie from New Era Film Company; and Hu Jinkang from Shanghai Yousheng Film Company, totaling over fifty people.</p>
<p>Agenda and Schedule</p>

<p>Chairman's Address</p>
<p>At 9:50 AM, the meeting was called to order with the ringing of a bell. After formal greetings, Chairman Ye Chucang delivered an opening address, saying, "Today, the Central Propaganda Committee convened this symposium of film company executives. It is a great pleasure to gather the leaders of the film industry together. In my opening remarks, I will make some statements regarding my duties, but in terms of technical aspects, I am an outsider. The opening address is like the opening act of a play; the best is yet to come. I will briefly report on two points: (A) Film is the greatest undertaking, and domestic films have the brightest future. This is known to all. The greatness of film lies in education, especially in the area of social education, which is the most universal and powerful. To see the authority of a nation, one only needs to look at its films, which will make it clear. This is a natural expression and cannot be faked in the slightest, like a drinker who cannot avoid the smell of alcohol on their breath. Therefore, what kind of films there are determines what kind of nation there is. Film is a kind of performance, and society is its content. As the saying goes, listening to the music of a country can determine its rise and fall, so its greatness can be known. Therefore, it is a necessary task to inspire a bright future. I hope that all of you present will work hard. (B) Those attending today can be divided into two parts: (1) those involved in film management, and (2) those involved in film application. Those who do not understand often mix the two together or divide them into two special classes. This is all wrong. Anyone involved in film should adhere to the principle of considering the film industry as the main body and work together. Although the duties are different, the authority is the same. Even the Film Industry Guidance Committee, the Film Script Review Committee, and the Film Censorship Committee do not manage or rule but can only fulfill their duties. When the film industry is not yet developed, they should find ways to help it. When the film industry is gradually progressing, they should be responsible for assisting it. In short, we should all work together to establish the film industry as the main body and work together towards the goal of the film industry. Although domestic films cannot be compared with those of advanced countries, they have made great progress. This is the result of your efforts, but this is still not enough. We should continue to work hard to find ways to enrich the content of domestic films, increase their vitality, and improve their technology. The purpose of today's meeting is this. In addition to reporting the above two points, I wish you all success."</p>
<p>The Central Propaganda Committee convened a group photograph of the film industry symposium, photographed by International News Agency.</p>
<p>Report on the Process</p>
<p>Following, Fang Zhi, representative of the Central Film Industry Committee, reported, saying, "Today, the Central Propaganda Committee convened the second symposium of film company executives in Shanghai, because of the deep connection between the film industry and propaganda work. To jointly assume the responsibility of developing the film industry with the film industry, this periodic symposium was held. Since the first symposium was convened in Beijing last March, more than a year has passed. In order to understand the progress of the film industry in the past year and to discuss the future direction of the film industry, this meeting was convened today. Our committee bears the mission of actively guiding the film industry, and we have high expectations for the results of this meeting. Therefore, I will extract a few points to inform the film industry. After the first film symposium, the various companies submitted a large number of proposals, with rich content, which could be selected. After the meeting, they were combined into nine proposals, including (1) 'Please ask the Central Government to consider the Northwest border defense, promote the production of borderland customs and human interest colonial films, and promote the concept of defending the country among the people.' This proposal is of the utmost urgency. The seriousness of the national crisis is becoming increasingly urgent, and the changes in the international situation are becoming increasingly dangerous. How to instill patriotic sentiments in the people and invigorate the national spirit? The production of colonial films is undoubtedly imperative. In the past year, the Central Propaganda Committee has successively sent personnel to Sichuan, Kang, Ningxia, and Inner Mongolia to take films. Once the editing is completed, it can be widely publicized. In the future, in addition to continuing to devote efforts to this work of building the spirit and national defense, we also hope that various companies will work together to organize film crews, go deep into the border areas, and engage in promotion. (2) 'Please ask the Central Government to formulate the key points of various scripts on revitalizing the nation and rejuvenating the country for various companies to adopt and compile scripts.' Our committee has also paid attention to this early on. The review of film scripts is only a passive guidance to reduce the losses suffered by various companies due to censorship. The active instruction of the outline of the scripts, as a specification for various companies to compile, and then to seek to meet the needs of the country and the nation, should be the key to guidance. However, in recent years, it has only been possible to stop at the work on the passive aspect, and the active guidance still needs to be worked on in the future. However, the style of the film has a great impact on the future of the country and the nation. It has been determined that the 'New Life Movement' is the central style of domestic films this year. The Central Propaganda Committee has sent letters to various companies to check and implement it. In the past year, there has not been any significant achievement. This cannot but hope that our film industry will deeply understand the importance of the New Life Movement, correct the mistake of blindly following European and Americanization, remove descriptions of lascivious, decadent, sensual romance, replace them with training in propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame, follow the standards set by the Central Government, and cooperate to achieve the same goal, so as to fulfill the responsibility of the social pioneers. (3) 'Regarding the winter request to the Central Government to support the development of the domestic film industry in the future, and strictly ban foreign-produced sensual and romantic films, and re-examine the foreign bad films that are already popular in the country,' the case has also been properly revised according to the original method. On the passive side, such as increasing the foreign film inspection fee, the Film Censorship Law has been amended by the Legislative Yuan. Also, such as 'strictly inspect foreign films,' the Film Censorship Committee has also earnestly followed the standards of foreign films needed by our country as stipulated by the Central Government. For those that are not needed by our country, the inspection should be strictly implemented. On the active side, such as 'rewarding the imitation and invention of film machinery,' the Central Government has promulgated measures to encourage the film industry, in order to promote it. Also, such as 'using the power of the government to assist domestic film production companies in matters that cannot be handled by their own abilities when shooting films,' the Central Propaganda Committee has also repeatedly issued letters of introduction. Others, such as rewarding excellent productions, are currently drafting the organizational regulations of the Domestic Film Evaluation Committee, which will be established soon to reward and encourage the courage of competition and achieve the effect of continuous improvement. (4) 'Requesting the government authorities to organize the shooting of educational films,' the original intention was valued by our committee. Film is a powerful tool for promoting culture and has the function of assisting education. Our people's intelligence is backward, and the work of popularizing education is urgently awaiting our efforts. Using educational films is the most powerful tool for popularizing education. In recent years, due to the advocacy of the Central Government, various places have gradually attached importance to it, such as the education departments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and the China Educational Film Association, which are all working hard to abandon the short and use the long to produce films. Recently, the Central Propaganda Committee plans to cooperate with the Silkworm Improvement Committee under the Economic Committee to produce educational films on sericulture. When the Central Film Studio starts filming in the future, it will naturally attach great importance to the production of educational films. We also hope that all companies will pay attention to this. For any film, we should always take three points of entertainment and seven points of education as the premise, so that education is contained in entertainment, and then the development of the film industry will have true meaning. (5) 'Please improve the review of film scripts and the inspection of films in the future.' The case was submitted to the Script Review Committee and the Film Censorship Committee for research and practical improvement. Regarding the review of scripts, the procedures should be simplified as much as possible. In order to enable various companies to avoid losses due to editing, the points to be deleted and revised should be indicated in detail. Regarding the inspection of films, the procedures should also be made as quick as possible. According to the statistics of the past year, about 50% of all films, from the date of registration to the date of inspection and issuance of the license, take two to four days. There is no delay except for special reasons. Recently, it has been stipulated that each film should be returned within 12 hours after the inspection is completed, in order to make it convenient for various companies. The process of review and inspection is being worked on to be fast and thorough. (6) 'How to protect the films that have been passed by the Central Film Censorship Committee that are banned by the local concession authorities?' In addition to sending a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for practical consultation, the film industry should have a deep understanding. It must be known that the reason why the concession authorities have such a contemptuous measure is because of our country's own weakness. Although there are many reasons for the country's weakness, the loss of the people's self-confidence and the shallowness of scientific knowledge are also important reasons. If the film industry does not want to be unreasonably interfered with by imperialists, the fundamental plan should be to work hard to restore national self-confidence and instill scientific knowledge, and the use of film is also in it. The above is the process of our committee handling the matters of the first film symposium, and it is also what I want to tell the film industry. Secondly, in the past year, under the overall social depression, our film industry has worked hard, and the development of its own business cannot be said to have no considerable achievements. However, given the dangerous situation in which our country is today, the needs of this time and place have their own characteristics. The efforts of the past are far from enough to revitalize the nation. In the future, the direction of the film industry's efforts should take the interests of the country and the nation as the greatest premise, and should not use catering to the low-level interests of society as a means of making profits. As mentioned above, the style of the film should be based on stimulating national consciousness, promoting the inherent culture, instilling scientific knowledge, and promoting production and construction. It should also promote the spirit of group unity, courage, and decisiveness, and cultivate good habits of respecting order and discipline. In order for the people of a country of scattered sand to be united and know how to strive through the education of film, this depends on the urgent efforts of our film industry. This is the second thing I want to tell you. At this meeting, each company, based on the experience of the past year, must have good opinions on the path to improve the film industry in the future, for the Central Government to refer to and work together to seek the long-term development of the film industry."</p>
<p>Review Shows Standards</p>
<p>Next, the Central Film Script Review Committee reported, "(1) The Central Government established this committee in view of the fact that domestic film companies in the past often suffered losses such as editing or complete banning of films due to film inspections, which caused a major blow to their business. In order to protect the film industry and avoid this unnecessary loss, this committee was established in November of the 22nd year under the Film Industry Guidance Committee to review the scripts that film companies or individuals across the country plan to produce, review the scripts submitted by the Central Government for review, discuss the compilation of scripts, and handle matters related to script awards. The scope of work of this committee includes handling other matters related to film scripts. (2) Review standards and procedures. This</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>The review standards of the committee have been clearly promulgated. In general, on the positive side, films should be able to exert their effectiveness in promoting national spirit, encouraging production and construction, instilling scientific knowledge, and establishing national morality. On the negative side, films that are harmful to good customs, public order, and the promotion of superstition and heresy are not allowed to appear. However, if the drama has depictions of good and evil as contrasts, and its ultimate purpose is to promote good rather than evil, it should be considered separately. For this reason, the review procedures of this committee must have different levels: (1) Preliminary review category: A. Those that are approved for passing in the preliminary review, the content of the matter is harmless, processing method: Preliminary review is approved to pass, and the applicant is notified to immediately compile a formal script with subtitles for each scene and submit it for re-examination. B. Those that are approved for passing with modifications in the preliminary review, the content of the matter is harmless, but a small part needs to be modified, processing method: Preliminary review is approved to pass with modifications, and the points to be modified are noted, and the applicant is notified to follow the modifications and compile a formal script with subtitles for each scene and submit it for re-examination. C. Those that are not approved for passing in the preliminary review, the content of the matter is very inconsistent and cannot be modified, processing method: Preliminary review is not approved to pass, and the original matter is returned. (2) Re-examination category: A. Those that are approved for passing in the re-examination, the content of the script is harmless, processing method: 1. Re-examination is approved to pass, and a registration permit is issued. 2. Notify the Film Censorship Committee for verification. B. Those that are approved for passing with modifications in the re-examination, the content of the script is harmless, but a small part still needs to be modified, processing method: 1. Re-examination is approved to pass with modifications, but the points to be modified must be noted, and the applicant is notified to follow the modifications and attach a registration permit. 2. Notify the Film Censorship Committee for verification. C. Those that are not approved for passing in the re-examination: 1. The content of the script is very inconsistent and cannot be modified, processing method: Re-examination is not approved to pass, and the original script is returned. 2. The content of the script is inconsistent, but it can be modified, processing method: Re-examination is not approved to pass, but the points to be modified are noted, and the applicant is notified to follow the modifications and compile another formal script and submit it for re-examination. If it still cannot pass, the original script will be returned. The above methods are purely based on the content of the film script, and the quality comparison is quite uneven, so the level of methods is difficult to determine. For the convenience of application, it is temporarily planned in this way. (3) The general tendency of scripts: Since the establishment of this committee, it has been more than a year, and the total number of scripts reviewed, after preliminary review, re-examination, and even five or six review procedures, is 234. Of course, there are also scripts that meet the standards, but this committee knows very well that the various companies are established by collecting people's capital, and they cannot but consider the business and first obtain the existence of the enterprise itself. Therefore, the general tendency of scripts in the past year is indeed inevitable to take love and unemployment as the backbone, and participate in scenes of sensuality and robbery to achieve the purpose of grasping the audience. However, this committee has also made many studies on this to make the plot avoid the important and take the light, in order to be able to not hinder the standards jointly required by the Central Government and the company. Under such circumstances, this committee has worked for a long time and spent a lot of effort. It feels that the so-called martial arts and supernatural films that quote the martial arts and supernatural stories of the old novels and take the old stage plays as the production of the so-called martial arts and supernatural films, and the so-called passionate and romantic blockbusters that purely exaggerate the carnal love affairs between men and women with various decadent scenes, have rarely appeared. Undoubtedly, this is the progress of the various companies, and it is also what this committee deeply gratifies. (4) Future hope: Everyone admits that domestic films in the past year have made great progress, but compared with European and American countries, they are still far behind. We will never be complacent. Especially in the compilation of scripts, we should strive for perfection. The responsibility of this committee is to fully improve the level of scripts on the positive side, correct the audience's taste, and promote the art of film. When it is absolutely necessary, it is bound to do some negative correction and return of work. This is a great regret in this committee. Now, China has a lot of film scripts, which proves that Chinese playwrights have the consciousness and self-determination to seek progress. At the same time, it can also prove that before the establishment of this committee, the reason why particularly excellent works of art could not be produced was because of the crude and rampant production of scripts. Originally, it is not an easy task to write a script that can pass in terms of meaning and skill, and the concerns of playwrights are multifaceted. Taking the issue of script taste as an example, it is enough to trouble them. Here, we feel that the essence of the script is to introduce the most exciting part of human life and many problematic stories in society to the audience for observation, appreciation, and criticism. It is not necessary to cater to the taste of the masses like water is wet and fire is dry, and take the audience's taste standards as the only tendency of the script's style. Moreover, the taste of the audience is complicated and complicated, and it may not be possible to grasp it. If the playwright must adapt to the taste of the audience in many ways, it will be exhausted and have little effect. The playwright only needs to be faithful to art, use artistic skills, and sincerely show human life on the silver screen within reach, then the audience will naturally unconsciously express sympathy for the characters being portrayed and develop unlimited interest. Therefore, playwrights do not need to waste energy in those areas, but hope to enrich their own life experience, examine objective reality, analyze the characters of the characters, in short, to cultivate and work hard in these areas. At the same time, it is hoped that the company can also consider increasing the material supply and treatment of playwrights, so that they can work on script writing with peace of mind. It is also hoped that the general film critics can kindly help playwrights, find novel themes, indicate the correct path, and recommend successful works to give playwrights full encouragement. (5) Conclusion: The film industry is a source of culture and a weapon of education. Modern countries are doing their best to actively improve it. At this moment, we hope that domestic films can gradually improve and gradually popularize to our ideal state. It is simply the same heart and the same reason. In order to effectively develop China's film industry, the mistakes of the past are only obtained from attempts, which can be used as our current reference. Everyone only needs to catch up from today, and the future is bright, but this is not to hope that one side of the people will do it alone, nor is it that one side of the people is only hoping that the government will do it. To be honest, this is a responsibility that the government and society should share.</p>
<p>Yu's Report</p>
<p>Yu Zhongying, the Chinese representative who attended the Soviet International Film Exhibition held in Moscow, Russia, last month, reported, "Russian films have a considerable status in the world. The reason is that the state operates without the phenomenon of infighting, so that talents and work are all in the entire plan. The Central Government has a Film Administration Bureau to preside over everything. At present, there are 34,400 cinemas in the Soviet Union, and progress is still advancing by leaps and bounds."</p>
<p>Continue the Meeting</p>
<p>After the report, it was 12:00, and the meeting was adjourned for lunch at Daguanlou on Sima Road. At 2:00 PM, the meeting continued, and the representatives of the various companies reported on the situation of their companies and various issues. Fang Zhi, Secretary of the Central Propaganda Committee, summarized and answered, elaborating and instructing on economic scripts, film reviews, and censorship, explaining that the Central Government is willing to do its best to help solve various difficulties, and explaining that supernatural films violate educational principles and should be banned. The representatives all felt very satisfied. Then, the proposals were discussed, and there were a total of six points. The proposing companies included Tianyi, Yihua, Mingxing, Kuaihuolin, and Diantong.</p>
<p>Satisfactory Result</p>
<p>The six major proposals were summarized into three general proposals: (1) The current Chinese film industry should implement economic collective organization; (2) Domestic films should seek to obtain international market salaries and promote publicity; (3) Request the Central Government to actively cultivate film talents and set up factories to produce film supplies. After repeated discussions, the results were very good. The authorities of the various companies were very happy that there was a way to save domestic films. It was resolved to submit the various measures decided to the Central Government for review and implementation. According to Fang Zhi, Secretary of the Central Propaganda Committee, to the Central News Agency reporter, the resolutions of the various cases will be officially announced after the Central Government has sorted them out.</p>
<p>Promote Sports</p>
<p>Then, the discussion of various film companies and business film directors selecting sports films to participate in international sports film competitions to promote the spirit of sports in our country, it was resolved that in addition to swimming, track and field, and various ball games, we must also pay attention to our country's inherent sports. The various companies are responsible for producing and submitting them to the Chinese Educational Film Association for transfer to the International Sports Film Competition Association, in order to take this opportunity to promote it internationally. Zheng Zhengqiu of Mingxing Film Company also stated that he has urged Mr. Chu Minyi to shoot Taijiquan. Then, temporary proposals were discussed.</p>
<p>Announce the Closing</p>
<p>Finally, Chairman Ye Chucang delivered a closing speech, saying that the end of the symposium is the time when the work of various resolutions begins. I hope that all of you present will share the great difficulties. The collection of New Life Movement speeches and the collection of speeches by Chairman Chiang, which were distributed just now, are meant to be a reference for you to take materials from the script. I wish all of you present to work hard and move forward. Zheng Zhengqiu thanked and represented Mingxing Film Company in inviting the Central Propaganda Committee and representatives of various film companies to have dinner at the Atlantic at 6:00 PM that evening. The meeting ended at 5:30. Everyone took a group photo as a souvenir. It is heard that the representatives sent by the Central Propaganda Committee will return to Beijing last night and this morning.</p>
<h3>New Life Service Corps Works Despite Rain Yesterday: Corps Members' Spirit Radiant in Rain, Citizens Understanding Advice Upon Hearing It</h3>
<p>The Kuomintang News Agency reports: Yesterday was the weekly holiday. The youth service corps organized by the New Life Movement Promotion Association of this city once again dispatched sleeve-banded members from various branch groups to commence work. Each member was led by a group leader, or by a school teacher, to serve on various roads. The main points of their work were to continue the previous efforts to rectify the city's appearance and traffic order. A reporter from the Kuomintang News Agency went to Xujiahui, Caojiadu, and Xiaodongmen yesterday to inspect and saw the corps members wearing white armbands, advising pedestrians along the way. The student corps members were especially lively. Although it was raining, their spirits were radiant. The citizens who were advised were happy to comply upon seeing the corps members being amiable and approachable. The city's appearance has indeed changed considerably, it is said.</p>
<h3>Art Exhibition: Seventh Day of Pre-Exhibition - Ancient Books from the Peking Library Already on Display, Ye Chucang and Chen Li-fu Visit and Observe</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the seventh day of the London Art Exhibition's Shanghai pre-exhibition. It happened to be a Sunday, and people from all walks of life took advantage of the holiday to visit, still extremely crowded, and did not diminish slightly compared to the previous few days due to the rain. The antiques displayed in the exhibition, which were previously deeply hidden in the inner palace or buried in the ground, are now gathered for exhibition, which has won the amazement of the audience and is also expected. Now, the association, fearing that there are too many visitors, in order to avoid crowding and maintain order, will limit the number of visitors to 3,000 per day, and tickets will not be sold when the quota is full, it is said. A reporter from the Central News Agency learned the following about the situation yesterday:</p>
<p>Qianlong Throne to Be Displayed Today</p>
<p>The throne used by the late Qing Dynasty Emperor Qianlong is made of rosewood, inlaid with cloisonné cloud patterns, with gilded wooden footrests and a yellow silk cotton cushion. The seat is almost twice as large as those used by ordinary people. In front of the throne is placed a rosewood painting table, with inscriptions by Liu Yong and Weng Fanggang carved on all four sides. The drawer surface has carvings of flowers by Banqiao, Qian Weicheng, Old Man Nansha, Tang Yifen, Jin Nong, Li Yu, Zou Yigui, etc. Various imperial stationery items are placed on top, such as water containers, ink, brushes, and vases. Behind the throne is a screen, made of rosewood, with six panels divided into upper and lower sections, and three gourd-shaped tops, originally gilded, but now faded. The screen is carved with a fairy mountain pavilion, extremely intricate. The association has now decided to start displaying the above items from today.</p>
<p>Two More Paintings and Calligraphy Arrive</p>
<p>The exhibition has continued to receive two more paintings and calligraphy works: (1) "Album of Flower Sketches" by the Five Dynasties artist Diao Guangyin; (2) "Silk Reeling Diagram" by the Song Dynasty artist Liu Songnian. It is said that genuine works of calligraphy and painting from before the Song Dynasty are extremely rare. The "Album of Flower Sketches" by Diao Guangyin, a talent from the Five Dynasties, is a rare treasure in the world, invaluable. It has an imperial poem inscribed by Emperor Qianlong. The painted flowers and butterflies are lifelike. The "Silk Reeling Diagram" by Liu Songnian of the Song Dynasty is also extremely precious.</p>
<p>Ye and Chen, Two Committee Members, Visit</p>
<p>Ye Chucang, Director of the Central Propaganda Committee, and Chen Lifu and his wife, Director of the Central Organization Committee, both visited the exhibition yesterday and browsed for a long time. They expressed deep admiration for the various ancient artifacts displayed. It is said that important figures from the Central Government will visit the exhibition one after another.</p>
<p>Rare Ancient Books Start to Be Displayed</p>
<p>Various famous porcelains are displayed in the porcelain exhibition room, worth a huge amount, all of which are extremely precious porcelains. Some visitors have requested to see the bottom of the porcelains. The association has now received this request and will display the bottom of some porcelains facing upwards so that those who study porcelain can view them. In addition, the Peking Library has sent another twenty kinds of rare ancient books, which were displayed in the sixth exhibition room yesterday. Among them, the "Geng Zhi Tu" (Pictures of Tilling and Weaving) printed in the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty and the "Ten Bamboo Studio Manual of Painting and Calligraphy" printed in the Chongzhen period of the Ming Dynasty were highly praised by the visitors for their exquisite printing. The cloisonné, enamel, cups, plates, pots, and Guanyin bottles displayed were admired by the visitors for their exquisite craftsmanship, which is definitely beyond the reach of modern foreign goods, it is said.</p>
<p>Ticket Price of Two Yuan Is Not Too High</p>
<p>The admission ticket for the exhibition is priced at two yuan. Some outsiders say that the price is a bit high. The association has stated that the value of the admission ticket is the lowest compared to the values set by exhibitions in various countries. The admission ticket for the London Art Exhibition in the United Kingdom is priced at one pound and five shillings, worth about twenty yuan in national currency. Circus and shadow puppet performances in Shanghai have prices of three yuan or more. The various exhibits displayed at this exhibition are all treasures of past dynasties, and their value is naturally incomparable. Moreover, the association spent no less than sixty or seventy thousand yuan in preparing for the pre-exhibition, and the exhibition period is not long, so the ticket price is appropriately set to slightly cover the expenses, which is completely different from those who aim to make profits, it is said.</p>
<p>Open for Viewing as Usual on Sunday Mornings</p>
<p>Reports that the association is closed on Sunday mornings are a mistake for Monday. The association is open for viewing as usual on Sunday mornings and will not be closed. However, the exhibition will be closed for half a day every Monday morning, it is said.</p>
<h3>Case of Pseudo-Manchu Maps at Gezhi Public School: Chen Heqin Expresses That It Is Not Difficult to Understand, Englishman Also Says It Was Unintentional Adoption</h3>
<p>Students at Gezhi Public School of the Shanghai Municipal Council raised issue the other day because the Asia map on page 41 of the textbook Wheaton'sModomTeachingAtlas had the words "Manchukuo" on it, and asked the school authorities to replace the textbook. A reporter from the Shen Shi News Agency specially visited Chen Heqin, director of the Chinese Education Bureau of the Shanghai Municipal Council, yesterday morning to inquire about whether there was a solution to this matter. According to Chen, there was a misunderstanding. Because the book is a world map, and the British principal of the school did not pay attention to it beforehand, resulting in the adoption of the book, it was not intentional to oppose the resolution of the League of Nations to deny the pseudo-Manchukuo. Chen continued, "The solution to this matter is also quite simple. After discussing it with the British Director of Education of the Shanghai Municipal Council today, it can be resolved satisfactorily. However, my intention is to tear off page 41 of the book, which is not a problem." According to the authorities of Gezhi Public School, this book was only adopted in the last two days. After the students discovered it, they immediately expressed their opposition. According to them, this book was written by an Englishman, and was adopted by the British principal of the school. They thought that since British schools could adopt their books, Chinese schools could also adopt them, but they did not know that the situation in China is different from that in foreign countries, so there was a slight misunderstanding. According to the opinion of the Westerners in the school, it was also said that it was unintentional adoption. It is estimated that this problem will not be expanded. They are now working on finding a proper solution to resolve it, it is said.</p>
<h3>Tax Increase on Foreign Rice and Wheat: Ministry of Finance Orders National Tariff Commission to Study</h3>
<p>The Ta Kung Pao reports: In order to prevent the dumping of foreign rice and wheat into China, which affects people's food and the rural economy, the Ministry of Finance has received requests from all parties and plans to increase the import tax universally. It has already ordered the National Tariff Commission to study this matter. After it is submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval in the future, it will immediately instruct the customs to implement it. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Universal Tax Increase</p>
<p>Since last year, rice merchants and flour mills in various provinces and cities have ordered more than 6 million bags of foreign rice and more than 3 million bags of foreign wheat from Saigon and other places, causing panic in the market. The sales of domestic rice have been sluggish, and the price has also fallen as a result, which has had a significant impact on rural areas. Therefore, the municipal government is preparing two concrete preventive measures to suggest to the central government for approval. After the Executive Yuan convened various ministries, committees, and governments for review, it was generally believed that the matter concerned the future of people's food, and that increasing taxes was not necessary. After careful consideration by the Ministry of Finance, in view of the dumping of foreign rice and the domestic rice price issue, it is necessary to implement tax increases in order to prevent the massive import of foreign rice in the future, and the effect can be doubled with half the effort. Regardless of the grade of foreign rice and wheat, it is decided to increase the import tax universally to show the restriction.</p>
<p>Study Over Time</p>
<p>The tax increase on foreign rice is an important issue for the national people's food. It cannot be easily implemented before careful consideration, so that the process will be difficult. The National Tariff Commission has been ordered to study it over time. Reporters from the Ta Kung Pao have learned from the Tariff Commission and rice industry groups in recent days that the central government plans to increase the import tax on foreign rice of No. 1 (30% broken rice), No. 2 (45% broken rice), No. 3 (60% broken rice), No. 4 (all broken rice), and foreign wheat from Canada, Australia, Chicago, etc., regardless of the grade. The tax will be increased by 0.25 customs gold units per 100 catties (that is, 0.25 yuan per 100 catties). All transit taxes collected by the customs in the past will be exempted.</p>
<p>Future Rice Prices</p>
<p>Since the dumping of foreign rice into China, the sales of domestic rice in this city have been sluggish, and the price has gradually fallen, which has had a significant impact on rural areas. In addition, the spring harvest this year has been greatly reduced due to climate disorder. Those who are concerned about rural economic recovery are quite anxious. According to rice industry observers, the rise and fall of rice prices cannot be predicted at present. Whether it rises or falls, there will be special changes in May according to past practice. The success or failure of rice merchants' business and the advantages or disadvantages of the rural economy can be determined at this time. According to experienced rice merchants, the price of rice this year must rise to more than sixteen yuan at the highest. If the autumn harvest this year is affected by disasters again, the rural problem will become deeply rooted and will be even more unbearable, it is said.</p>
<h3>Zhang Fakui Will Go to Guizhou to Meet Chairman Chiang</h3>
<p>Central Committee member Zhang Fakui returned from a European tour last month and telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to request the date and location of the meeting. According to reports from Nanjing, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has specially sent a Ford plane to Shanghai to welcome Zhang to Guizhou, it is said. A reporter from the Central News Agency specifically inquired about this statement with Zhang's associates. According to them, Zhang will indeed go to Guizhou in the next few days to meet Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and report on his observations from his European tour, but the exact date has not yet been determined. As for whether he will fly to Guizhou on a Ford plane, it is also not yet certain.</p>
<h3>Ariyoshi Enters Nanjing This Morning</h3>
<p>Japanese Ambassador to China Akira Ariyoshi is scheduled to return to his country on the 20th aboard the Tatsuta Maru to meet with Foreign Minister Hirota and report on everything. The Japanese ambassador originally planned to take the early train to Nanjing yesterday morning to say goodbye to our diplomatic authorities, but the matter was postponed until eight o'clock this morning, when he took the early train to Nanjing. Those traveling with him include Counselor Arino and Secretary Yokokawa and many others, it is said.</p>
<h3>Yin Tong and Others Go to Nanjing</h3>
<p>Yin Tong, Tang Youren, Zeng Zhongming, Ye Chucang, Zhu Jiahua, Yu Youren, Chen Diaoyuan, Yang Dezhao, etc., take the night train to Nanjing.</p>
<h3>New Military Attaché Isogai Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Lieutenant General Isogai, the newly appointed military attaché of the Japanese Embassy in China, recently left Japan aboard the Japanese mail ship Nagasaki Maru to take up his new post in China, and arrived in Shanghai at 4:30 pm yesterday. Those who went to welcome him include Araki, commander of the Japanese Special Naval Landing Forces in Shanghai, and many others, it is said.</p>
<h3>Swedish Chargé d'Affaires Asks to Return Home</h3>
<p>Lin Guishi, the Swedish Consul General in Shanghai and Chargé d'Affaires to China, has asked for an eight-month leave and is scheduled to return home on the Cordillera mail ship tomorrow. During his absence from Shanghai, Harmanstoff will take over the post.</p>
<h3>Election of the Real Estate Association: Committee Member Pi Attends the Municipal Council, Mr. Feng Bingnan Is Re-Elected Consecutively</h3>
<p>There are two Chinese committee members in the Shanghai Municipal Council Land Committee, one elected by the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association and one elected by the Shanghai Real Estate Association. The Shanghai Real Estate Association held a meeting the other day to elect the committee member to the Municipal Council Land Committee for this year. More than 100 people attended, and Li Bohan was publicly elected as chairman. It was resolved to recommend Mr. Feng Bingnan for re-election as the committee member to the Municipal Council Land Committee. The association will send a letter to the Municipal Council to notify them.</p>
<h3>Enthusiastic Response from Aviation Solicitation Teams</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Solicitation Team Headquarters of the China Aviation Association began its solicitation work, the team leaders have been working very hard and reporting their achievements, as previously reported. It is reported that the headquarters has received from Captain Chuan Qilin of Team 276 a membership fee of 150 yuan, from Captain Zhou Bangjun of Team 234 a donation of 50 yuan, from Captain Cai Wuji of Team 278 a membership fee of 66 yuan, which was sent to the Bank of Shanghai for collection. Captain Li Ting'an of Team 154 has submitted a third supplementary report with another 118 yuan in achievements. Captain Wang Xishen of Team 205 has reported achievements of 202 yuan. It can be seen that the team leaders are generally working hard to solicit donations, it is said.</p>
<p>Since the hotel industry began collecting donations for aviation and national salvation last year, the results have been very impressive due to the hotel industry's enthusiasm for patriotism. However, a small number of hotels have not been very diligent. The Aviation Association Headquarters and the Hotel Industry Association saw this situation and feared that it would affect the progress in the long run. Therefore, on the 3rd of this month, an expanded fundraising committee was convened. Zhang Yuliang from the Headquarters attended and it was resolved to regularly expand fundraising to hotels in both concessions that are not diligently collecting donations, as reported in various newspapers. It is reported that the headquarters sent more than ten staff members, including Li Jimin, Zhu Shengyang, Lu Zhangzhao, and Zou Juncheng, the other day to first persuade hotels in the Public Concession that were not diligently collecting donations or had stopped collecting donations, such as Jingsheng, Haidongchun, Yingbin, Changchun, Xingzhou, Qinghe, Jiuhua, Yixin, Tianfugong, Wulin, Huibin, Donghai, Yunsheng, and Pujiang, to earnestly handle the matter and work hard to collect donations. If they still do things perfunctorily, the Headquarters and the Clan Industry Association will formulate effective measures to deal with them. Today, they will continue to persuade hotels in the Public Concession and the French Concession that are not diligently collecting donations, it is said.</p>

<h3>China Agriculture and Industry Bank Held Shareholders Meeting Yesterday: Full-Year Net Profit of More Than 550,000 Yuan, Deposits of More Than 25,520,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Shen Shi News Agency reports: At 2:00 pm on the 14th of this month, the China Agriculture and Industry Bank held its eighth annual shareholders meeting at the bank's office on Henan Road, Second Road. More than 100 shareholders attended, including Zhang Jingjiang, Li Shizeng, Zhang Gongquan, Zhou Zuomin, Wang Ganqi, Xia Weiru, Wu Zhenxi, Qi Yunqing, Lu Hanyun, Nie Peiyuan, Cheng Zhuxin, Xiao Jiting, Wang Guohua, Qin Huijia, Xu Zuoren, Liu Shixin, and Pan Mingxin. Li Shizeng was publicly elected as chairman. First, the chairman gave a speech, saying in brief that in the past year, countries around the world have been competing to inflate currencies, reduce currency values, seek exchange rate balances, and benefit trade exports in order to save their own economies. Our country has also been affected. In addition, frequent water and drought disasters have led to the bankruptcy of the rural economy, the influx of foreign goods, the decline of all industries, and the outflow of silver, the tightening of the money supply, and the market has become even more sluggish. All industries are in deeper trouble, and the financial industry is closely related. Fortunately, our bank has always been cautious. In this environment, various businesses have still made slightly more progress than in 1933. This is gratifying to the shareholders. Then, he reported on the business situation and the financial statement. It is estimated that in 1934, after deducting various expenses, a profit of more than 550,000 yuan was earned, an increase of more than 220,000 yuan compared with 1933. The various deposits totaled more than 25,520,000 yuan, an increase of more than 1,400,000 yuan compared with the previous year. The loans and issuance, as well as other businesses, have also increased significantly. Following the report on the distribution of net profit, the directors and supervisors were re-elected. The elected directors were Li Yuying, Zhang Gongquan, Wang Ganqi, Wei Daoming, Fang Yaoting, Feng Youwei, Zhou Zuomin, Qian Xinzhi, Qi Yunqing, Lu Hanyun, Song Ziliang, Zhou Taofu, He Nanqi, Liu Shixin, and Qin Yu. The elected supervisors were Zhang Jingjiang, Wang Junyi, Xia Weiru, Wu Zhenxi, and Pan Mingxin. The meeting closed at 5:00 pm.</p>

<h3>Construction of Qiujiang Wharf Begins: Half of the Entire Three Li Completed First, Filling and Piling Completed</h3>
<p>In order to develop the transportation plan in the city center, the Shanghai Municipal Government is building the Qiujiang Wharf and light railway to realize the goal of water and land combined transportation. In addition to the light railway, which has already started construction and is expected to be completed before October this year, the Qiujiang Wharf has been invested and contracted by the Central Bank. A reporter from the Central News Agency has learned the following:</p>
<p>Principles Agreed</p>
<p>It is reported that the Qiujiang Wharf covers an area of 2,500 mu. In order to develop the transportation in the city center, it was planned to be built long ago. Now, the municipal government and the Central Bank have agreed on a method, in which the Central Bank invests in the construction. The procedures for land acquisition have already been completed by the Municipal Land Bureau, and the filling and piling have been completed by the Municipal Bureau of Public Works. It is said that the content of the method agreed upon by the municipal government and the Central Bank is based on the principles of not hindering road traffic in the city center and connecting train traffic in the city center.</p>
<p>Large Scale</p>
<p>The scale of the wharf is grand. It is said that the entire shoreline is three li. It is now planned to complete half of it first, and build many warehouses and godowns for storing goods. The wharf is connected to the railway in the city center, which is not comparable to other wharves. It is said that a public wharf will also be built, measuring 100 meters in length, where various ships can dock freely. The project is expected to be completed this year, and will be leased and used by the Central Bank in the future.</p>
<h3>There Was Thunder and Rain the Night Before Last: The Local Area Was Overcast at Noon Yesterday, Showers Stopped Until Evening, The Sky Remained Overcast</h3>
<p>The weather in this area has been quite cold recently, unlike late spring. After 9:00 pm the night before last, there was sudden thunder and lightning, and strong wind and heavy rain. Although the thunder stopped after an hour, the wind and rain continued all night. At dawn yesterday, the wind stopped and the rain stopped, but the sky was still extremely overcast. It was not until about 9:00 am that the clouds broke and the sun came out, but the air pressure was very low and extremely humid, and the ground was quite humid, making people uncomfortable. By about 11:00 am, the sky suddenly turned as dark as ink, the sunlight disappeared, and the darkness reached its extreme. It was almost impossible to work indoors without lights. Before long, there was another shower, sometimes slow and sometimes heavy, which did not stop until 5:00 pm. However, the rain was still heavy, and it was difficult to expect the sky to clear. It was also learned that in the thunderstorm the night before last, the sewers were so clogged that it was difficult to drain, and the roads quickly accumulated water.</p>
<h3>Japanese Consulate General Publishes a Bulletin on the Criminal Situation of Japanese Residents in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Japanese-language Shanghai Daily reported that the Japanese Consulate General published the following bulletin on "Recent Criminal Tendencies of Japanese Residents" on the 13th: "An investigation into the crimes of Japanese residents in Shanghai reveals that, in addition to general causes, many crimes are based on special circumstances in Shanghai. The details are as follows: 1. General Causes: These are the same as in the mainland (Japan). Most of the criminals are from broken families, or lost their parents at a young age and were raised by stepparents or relatives. Many have relied on others for support since childhood. There are countless cases of people becoming estranged from their families due to complex family matters and going astray. Not a few have received secondary education. In the end, whether they have received school education or not has nothing to do with crime. Generally speaking, most of them have traveled around. When investigated, they often mention their deceased father and mother and feel guilty, but the quality of the criminals is inevitably different from ordinary people. 2. Special Causes: A. Store Clerks: Commit fraud and embezzlement by fabricating accounts. B. Those employed in stores are often different from the situation in Japan. They lack pocket money and rely on personal relationships for a short period of time, so all kinds of improper things happen. C. The environment in Shanghai is harsh and easily tempted by various parties, such as dog racing, dancing, and the pleasure quarters. Many are tempted by the dream of getting rich quick, leading to poverty and crime. D. The habit of smoking opium and other narcotics is rampant among Japanese residents, leading to addiction and crime, and thus falling into poverty and committing fraud, theft, and robbery. E. Many have fled to Shanghai from crimes committed in Japan. F. Shanghai lacks sophisticated entertainment facilities, and due to environmental reasons, they roam the streets and commit crimes."</p>

<h3>Judgement on the Dispute over Compensation in the May Thirtieth Massacre: The Appeals of Zhang Yueqiu and Others are Rejected</h3>
<p>After the May Thirtieth Massacre in 1925, negotiations with the Public Works Department (工部局) led to a compensation of 150,000 yuan from the department to the families of the dead and wounded in January 1930. After Yu Qiaqing (虞洽卿) collected the funds on behalf of the families, the money, after deducting prior loans and expenses for building the May Thirtieth Martyrs' Cemetery, was distributed based on the resolution of the May Thirtieth Families of the Dead and Wounded Meeting: 2,000 yuan for each deceased, 5,000 yuan for each seriously injured and disabled, and 500 yuan for each wounded. Fifty-five families have received the compensation. Over 10,000 yuan remained, which Yu Qiaqing kept in custody for any omissions.</p>
<p>Last summer, Zhang Yueqiu and Zhan Chunting, who had already received compensation, jointly filed a petition with the First Special District Local Court, accusing Yu Qiaqing, Cheng Xiechun (成燮春), a director of the May Thirtieth Cemetery Committee, and Hu Changsheng (胡長生) and Chen Fucai (陳甫才), representatives of the Families Association, of fraudulent accounting and requesting an investigation. The initial trial ruled that the accusations were groundless and rejected the petition. Since then, Zhang and Zhan have consistently filed appeals to the Supreme Court, but all have been unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Their litigious spirit remained undeterred. Recently, as their civil suit had failed completely, they started anew, returning to the First Special Court to file a criminal self-indictment against Yu and the other three, accusing them of embezzling compensation funds. Yu and the others, feeling unable to tolerate the baseless accusations and fabricated lawsuits, also appointed lawyers Chen Tingrui (陳霆銳) and Jiang Yiping (江一平) to file a counterclaim, requesting that they be punished for false accusations.</p>
<p>After repeated hearings and investigations, the Magistrate Wu Tingqi (吳廷琪) summoned both parties and witnesses, including accountant Jiang Xinzhao (蔣信昭) and a clerk surnamed Pan hired by the May Thirtieth Families Association, to review the meeting minutes and audit the accounts. Jiang and Pan presented their work, proving that the submitted books were not, as the plaintiffs claimed, attendance records, but meeting minutes. Magistrate Wu noted that the plaintiffs had repeatedly claimed the books were forged and raised various doubts, but all had been clarified. The plaintiffs' statements were based on conjecture.</p>
<p>To be thorough, Magistrate Wu asked Zhang Yueqiu whether he had any other evidence to prove his accusations were true. Zhang stammered and spoke vaguely, and his words were inconsistent. The court ordered the start of the debate. After both sides finished their arguments, the verdict was announced, dismissing both the original suit and the counterclaim. Zhang and Zhan were admonished for rashly filing criminal lawsuits based on groundless rumors. The court said that such behavior should be punished but pardoned them because they were also injured in the May Thirtieth Massacre.</p>
<h3>Filial Father Strangles Unfilial Son: Wife Helps in the Crime</h3>
<p>Yu Huogen (余火根), nearly sixty years old, a local resident with the house number 2 in the southern house of the southern section of Yujiatang, Hongqiao Town, west of Shanghai, has a son named Guan Hong (關紅), thirty-six years old, and a wife, Chen. They have one son and two daughters. Guan Hong does not pursue a legitimate career and has fallen into depravity. Recently, he has become addicted to morphine injections. Yu Huogen and his daughter-in-law, Chen, tried to dissuade him, but he would not listen. The whole family hated him. Starting this spring, they stopped providing him with food and drink. Guan Hong had no choice but to beg for food along the streets, dressed in rags like a beggar. Yu Huogen felt ashamed and disgusted and decided to kill his son.</p>
<p>On the night of the eleventh (of this month), he, his daughter-in-law Chen (Guan Hong's wife), and an accomplice, Zhang Ajin (張阿金), strangled Guan Hong in his room. Before he died, Guan Hong's aunt, Yu Tang (余唐氏), cried for help, but because she was blind, she could not go to help him. At dawn, the family told everyone that Guan Hong had died suddenly the night before and hastily prepared him for burial. But people in the village were whispering that Chen had murdered her husband. The police chief of the Hongqiao Town Police Station, Huo Fengchi (霍鳳池), learned of the situation and, as it concerned human life, temporarily detained Yu Huogen and his daughter-in-law, Chen, for investigation.</p>
<h3>Indian Man Rapes Young Girl: Fifteen-Year-Old Girl Assaulted; Indian Man Flees</h3>
<p>Xu Xiangzhou (徐祥州), a blind man from Yancheng, fifty-two years old, lives with his daughter, Jin Di (金弟), fifteen years old, at No. 21 Guoqing Lane, Hengtong Road, Zhabei. Xu tells fortunes to make a living, and his daughter sells vegetables in western Shanghai. In the afternoon, the girl was returning home when Inde Sheng (音德生), an Indian man (twenty-three years old) who worked as a gatekeeper at a photo studio, followed her home. Seeing that she was alone, he restrained her and raped her three times. The girl cried out in pain, and the neighbor, Wang Gendi (王根弟), rushed to her aid. The Indian man fled. Wang took the girl to report to the Caojiadu Branch Bureau.</p>
<p>Director Wang received the report and ordered detectives Zhu Bengui (朱本貴) and Du Jingxiang (杜景祥) to bring the Indian man, Inde Sheng, and the girl's father, Xu Xiangzhou, to the bureau. The detectives interrogated them and confirmed the facts. They decided to transfer the Indian man to the British Consulate for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Abuse of Apprentice Adjudicated: Wang Lilin Detained Pending Sentencing</h3>
<p>Zhang Cailiang (張才良), a sixteen-year-old apprentice shoemaker from Gaoyou, was at the Zhoujiazui Road No. 439 shop at around 9 AM on the third of this month, when a dispute arose from a damaged shoe which was to be made for a customer. He spoke disrespectfully, and his master, Wang Lilin (王禮林) from Yangzhou, became angry and beat him severely with a wooden stick, leaving him covered in bruises and with a fractured left shoulder. He fell to the ground in agony.</p>
<p>His father, Zhang Qitong (張啓童), reported the incident to the Jiaxing Road Patrol Room, who sent detective Xu Yongyuan (徐永源) to arrest Wang and confiscate the wooden stick. They were sent to the First Special District Court. Zhang Cailiang was seriously injured in Tongren Hospital and could not appear in court, so they released Wang and postponed the hearing.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Magistrate Jiang Shuzi (姜樹滋) continued the trial in the Criminal Third Court. A lawyer of the Public Works Department, Li Zhishan (厲志山), stated that Zhang Cailiang was recovering and asked the court to question him. Zhang Cailiang said that he did not insult the customer for having the shoes made, but his master beat him with a wooden stick and kicked him. His arms were injured and could not move. The court cross-examined the defendant, who stood by his previous statement.</p>
<p>The court began the arguments. Li Zhishan argued that Zhang Cailiang had acted poorly and should be punished lightly, but not with such brutality, and asked for an appropriate sentence. The defendant's representative, lawyer Fan Gang (范剛), asked for leniency and a suspended sentence if found guilty. Magistrate Jiang ordered the defendant to be detained, with sentencing scheduled for a later date.</p>
<h3>Modern Woman Drives Car, Kills Elderly Man: Patrol Room Files Public Prosecution; Victim's Family Reports Incident</h3>
<p>Wei Taolan (魏陶蘭), a modern woman from Nanjing (her brother Wei Jiqing claims she is from Yangzhou), twenty-two years old, fluent in Western languages and unemployed, residing at No. 25, Lane 100, Henry Road in the French Concession, was driving her private car, number 11818, on Avenue Edward VII on the fifth of this month at 3:30 PM, traveling east to west, when, at the intersection of the East Water and Fire Street and Avenue Edward VII, in front of No. 409, an elderly man, Wang Huaiyu (王懷於), nearly sixty years old, wearing a garment for the dead, was crossing the road from south to north.</p>
<p>Wei could not brake in time and hit Wang, causing him to fall and injure his head. Patrolmen arrived and helped the injured man into Wei's car and took him to the Mulan Patrol Room. After questioning, the patrol chief sent Wang to the hospital for treatment and detained Wei and her car, sending them to the General Patrol Room for further investigation. However, Wang died at 3:00 AM that night due to his injuries.</p>
<p>The Patrol Room sent the body to the coroner's office. Finding no family members, they reported to the Second Special Court the next day and sent officers to examine the body. The court ordered the body to be photographed, dressed, and buried by the Tongren Fuyuan Hall. The Police Department was to investigate whether the defendant was at fault and bring her to justice. Wei, feeling sorry for the victim's tragic death without family, contributed 50 yuan for a shroud and coffin and entrusted the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall to prepare the burial.</p>
<p>The Patrol Room transferred the defendant, Wei Taolan, and her brother and witness, Wei Jiqing, to the Second Special Court. The Police Department filed a public prosecution against Wei for causing death by negligence. Magistrate Tong Chaozuo (童朝佐) presided over the trial in the Criminal First Court. Police Department lawyer Yuan Jiahuan (袁家潢) explained the case, and Western Detective Cleary (克來西) reported the results of the investigation. After questioning the defendant and witnesses, the court adjourned for a later hearing. It is now reported that the deceased's daughter has identified the deceased's photograph at the coroner's office and reported it to the Patrol Room, and also filed a petition with the court requesting the body and demanding compensation.</p>
<h3>Divorce Judgement for the Owner of Shiyi Bakery and His Wife</h3>
<p>Wei Yifei (魏一飛), also known as Wei Tang (魏唐), twenty-eight years old, a Shaoxing native, the owner of the Shiyi Bakery and a film actor, residing at No. 160, the intersection of Avenue Petain and Route des Soeurs in the French Concession, married Li Meiying (李媚英), twenty-four years old, from Ningbo, through a matchmaker on the second day of the ninth lunar month in 1929.</p>
<p>After the marriage, the couple had a good relationship and had three children. The youngest died of sores. After the January 28th Incident, the bakery business flourished, and Wei earned a lot of money. He also made a good income from acting, bought a car, and frequented brothels, singing halls, and dance halls. He took prostitutes Shi Fanglaoqi and Chunqiu Laoqi as concubines and built separate houses for them. He also cohabited with a妖女 named Yao Yahong (姚雅紅). Because Wei's affection was not exclusive, the concubines filed lawsuits to leave him, costing him money.</p>
<p>His wife, Li Meiying, saw her husband's licentious and unrepentant behavior and tried to persuade him, but it angered him, and he often abused her. Their relationship broke down, and Wei locked her out of the house. Li left with their two children, temporarily staying at a relative's house at No. 36 Jiugeng Lane, Miller Road, Hongkou, hoping that her husband would return to his senses and restore their relationship. However, repeated mediation by relatives and friends was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Li Meiying hired a lawyer and filed for divorce, first requesting mediation at the Second Special District Local Court, but it failed. She then officially filed a lawsuit, requesting a divorce, 15,000 yuan for alimony, the return of her dowry and clothing, and education expenses for the two children. The court, upon receiving the petition, opened a hearing by Magistrate Li Liang (李良). Wei presented a defense, opposing the divorce.</p>
<p>The case has now concluded with arguments and a verdict announced. The court ruled that the marriage between the two parties was dissolved, and the defendant was ordered to return two boxes of clothing to the plaintiff and pay the plaintiff 2,000 yuan in alimony. The remainder of the plaintiff's claims were dismissed. The plaintiff was to bear seven-eighths of the litigation costs, and the defendant was to bear the remainder. It is reported that the defendant is dissatisfied with the ruling and will file an appeal.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Water and Electricity Company to Supply Electricity to Jiading: Filed with Municipal Government and Construction Committee</h3>
<p>Filed with Municipal Government and Construction Committee (Central News Agency): The Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, in response to requests for electricity from the Jiading Textile Dyeing Company and others, plans to lay power lines through Nanxiang Town to Jiading. The power demand of the textile dyeing company and others is approximately 500 kilowatts.</p>
<p>The company initially requested the Huaxing Yongji Electric Plant in Jiading County to supply electricity, but the plant could not meet the demand and voluntarily relinquished its power supply rights. The Zhabei Water and Electricity Company then negotiated with the Huaxing Yongji Electric Plant. The Jiading Textile Company will provide 10,000 yuan for the powerlines. The Zhabei Water and Electricity Company and the Huaxing Yongji Electric Plant in Jiading County jointly submitted the case to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, which in turn submitted it to the Municipal Government and the Construction Committee for record.</p>
<h3>Continued Report on the Italian Painter Salong's Exhibition</h3>
<p>The Italian painter Salong's solo exhibition opened at 3 PM on the 13th at the Sino-French Friendship Association at No. 11 Huanlong Road. Approximately one thousand Chinese and foreign visitors have attended each day. Admission is free. The exhibition includes a painting critique written by Cai Yuanpei (蔡孑民), president of the Academia Sinica.</p>
<p>Mr. Salong grew up in Venice, Italy, a place crisscrossed by rivers and traversed by gondolas, much like the Jiaxing, Huzhou, Suzhou, and Songjiang areas of China. During the Italian Renaissance, the Venetian school of painters, known for their poetic use of color, rivaled the Florentine school. Mr. Salong cultivated his personal interests and was influenced by his environment, dedicating himself to painting. He not only mastered the strengths of European painters but also learned from Eastern painters.</p>
<p>After coming to China, he purchased famous paintings and roamed the landscapes. He favored the area between Jiaxing and Jiashan for its pure Chinese style, untouched by European influence. He painted extensively, depicting water, boats, bridges, rural cottages, snow, sunsets, black crows, women on boats and in windows (chosen for their brightly colored clothes), and clothes drying on bamboo poles. His other works, from Shanghai, Japan, and Nice, France, varied slightly in subject matter but all possessed a refined air and poetic charm. This level of artistry could only be achieved through a fusion of Eastern and Western strengths and a unique creative approach. The paper and pigments used by Mr. Salong are all made by hand in China using traditional methods. The exhibition begins with an explanation of its origins, intended for the people of the city.</p>
<p>A message from Mr. Cheng Yansheng (程演生) states, "This exhibition by Salong is a meeting between true art and true art lovers. It is not introduced or promoted by the influence of diplomats. This is Salong's character, and this is Salong's painting." It is evident that the Chinese people admire Salong. The exhibition will close at 6 PM on the 22nd.</p>

<h3>Zhabei Water and Electricity Company Shareholders Meeting: Increase Capital by Four Million, Collect One Million First</h3>
<p>The commercially operated Zhabei Water and Electricity Company convened its 11th regular shareholders meeting yesterday at 2 PM at the Ningbo Association. Shareholders representing 165,711 shares, totaling 149,869 units of equity, attended. Le Zhenbao (樂振葆) was elected as chairman. First, General Manager Lu Bohong (陸伯鴻) reported on the</p>
<p>Business Overview</p>
<p>He stated that the company was established ten years ago and has faced many difficulties, including the January 28th Incident. Fortunately, the financial community resolutely provided funds, and the foundation gradually stabilized. Since becoming general manager, he and the directors have worked hard to restore the company, hoping not to disappoint society and the shareholders. This year's business progress includes expanding water and electricity projects, improving water and electricity equipment, attracting factories, promoting electricity, supplying electricity to other companies, installing water meters, issuing company bonds, improving accounting, and reviewing all assets. These measures have been implemented gradually. Although the results and the post-war environment have not yet reached the expected two-thirds level, society has a considerable understanding of the company's service spirit. Thus, in the midst of economic decline, the company's business development in 1934 was particularly rapid, and the total revenue of 4,800,313 yuan broke the record of the past decade. This is something to celebrate for all shareholders. The details of this year's business and work are detailed in the business report and will not be repeated here. The following are the key points:</p>
<p>(1) The shareholders' meeting in February 1933 decided to issue company bonds. After consulting with the banks that had previously provided loans, the banks agreed to manage the issuance. The banks would manage the custody of the collateral and the payment of principal and interest, in order to demonstrate creditworthiness. The proposal was submitted to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau and then to the Central Supervisory Department for approval. The management was entrusted to the Savings Association of the Four Banks, the Bank of Communications, Jin City Bank, Zhonghua Industrial Encouragement Bank, and Zhejiang Xingye Bank. The first tranche of bonds, totaling 4.5 million yuan, was fully subscribed within a few days, demonstrating that society has full confidence in the company and the excellent credit of the managing banks. The bonds are repaid in sixteen installments every six months and are satisfied in eight years. Since the issuance of the bonds, the company has repaid the syndicated loans and the short-term loans from various banks, the tail end of the Skoda machine price, and the old debt to the municipal government, totaling over 5.338 million yuan. All old debts have been cleared. From now on, the company only needs to amortize the principal and interest of the company bonds on a yearly basis, which will significantly reduce the company's annual interest expense.</p>
<p>(2) The company's business policy is to promote electricity to develop its business. In 1934, a large number of new electricity users were added, including Shanghai University, the Zhanghuabang Customs Office, the Dredging Bureau, and the North Station and Wusong Machine Factory of the Two-Way Administration. In the past, these users generated their own electricity, but now they use the company's electricity. In addition, the Tianli Gas Plant, the Greater China Paper Factory, the Central Machinery Factory run by the Ministry of Industry, and the fish market will also be electrified this year. On the positive side, this will help the development of industry and benefit the national economy and people's livelihood. On the negative side, it will reduce the consumption of users. The company believes that with the current political stability, it can support the establishment of industrial factories in the inland areas, which can not only revive the inland economy but also provide jobs for unemployed farmers. Therefore, the company is focusing on expanding electricity to the recent inland areas. The Jiafeng Textile Dyeing Company in Jiading urgently needs electricity, but the local area is unable to supply it. The company negotiated to erect poles and wires to supply electricity, which has been approved by the Central Construction Committee and is currently surveying the route. In the future, the poles and wires can also supply electricity to other needs along the route outside the exclusive areas of the Nanxiang and Jiading electricity plants.</p>
<p>(3) The company's power generation equipment is currently insufficient. In the summer of last year, the board of directors decided to purchase a 10,000-kilowatt turbine generator, three boilers that produce 40 tons of steam per hour, and a 12,500-kilovolt-ampere step-up transformer, along with other necessary accessories. Bids were opened in January of this year, and the contract is being negotiated with the winning bidder. It is expected that this project will be completed by the end of next year.</p>
<p>(4) The case of the Shanghai Waterworks Company taking back the water supply in the city of Shanghai is complex and involves frequent negotiations. With the continued efforts of Director Feng Bingnan (馮炳南), he obtained the understanding and sympathy of all relevant parties and gradually resolved the issue. By 1934, the transfer was completely resolved and clear. He is grateful to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau and the Shanghai Waterworks Company for their spirit of cooperation and to Director Feng Bingnan for his support.</p>
<p>The company's employees are loyal, dedicated, and diligent. All plans have been implemented in an orderly manner. The General Manager concluded by saying that he must say a few words to praise the company's most promising and valuable intangible assets.</p>
<p>The meeting then voted to distribute dividends and bonuses, and then voted to increase capital by four million yuan, first collecting one million yuan. Zhu Qichen (朱棄塵), Wang Yunfu (王雲甫), Xu Qianlin (徐乾麟), Li Jisheng (李濟生), and Shi Boqun (施博羣) were re-elected as supervisors. Lu Yigeng (陸隱耕), Yao Mulian (姚慕蓮), and Liu Pinsan (劉聘三) were elected. The meeting adjourned at 5 PM.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association Appeals to Prohibit Cage Fishing of Cuttlefish Due to Its Impact on Fish Reproduction; Government Approves Investigation and Prohibition</h3>
<p>The islands of Huawu, Shengshan, and Lühua, which belong to Chongming County, are important fishing areas for Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Every fishing season, fishermen from various regions gather to engage in fishing. In the 20th year of the Republic of China, Ningbo fishermen netted cuttlefish. Fishermen from the Wenzhou and Taizhou regions used cage fishing, which hindered net fishing and fish reproduction, leading to conflicts and an unprecedented tragedy. The government investigated and reiterated the ban on cage fishing, issuing a clear order. With the current fishing season approaching, Wenzhou fishermen, disregarding the ban, reportedly plan to reorganize and engage in cage fishing again. Upon learning of this, Ningbo net fishermen are deeply concerned and fearful. If this becomes a reality, net fishermen, for the sake of their livelihoods, will inevitably seek self-defense. Future disputes are feared to be unavoidable. They have reported this to the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai, requesting them to petition the government to maintain the ban. The association, upon learning the situation, has separately petitioned the Ministry of Industry and the Jiangsu Provincial Government to promptly order the Fishery Protection Office to dispatch warships to prevent this, or to order the Chongming County Government to strictly investigate and prohibit it. It is now reported that the association has successively received replies from the Ministry of Industry and the Jiangsu Provincial Government, which are recorded below. (1) The Ministry of Industry replied: "We have received your letter regarding the Wenzhou fishermen carrying cages to Jiangsu customs waters to fish for cuttlefish. Previously, the Shengshan Branch of the Chongming County Fishermen's Association in Jiangsu sent a telegram requesting the dispatch of warships to stop this. We have ordered the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction to promptly investigate and properly handle the matter and report back.

Mr. Xu was known for his generosity, chivalry, and respectable demeanor among his peers. Two years ago, he was unfortunately implicated in the case of Tai Bao A Shu, unjustly suffering grievance.

On the 13th, the shop owner and other craftsmen all went to Pudong to watch the god welcoming festival. At around 2:00 PM, Li suddenly had a verbal dispute with Zhou Guanguan, a senior apprentice, and was slapped twice in the face by Zhou. Zhou then went out. Taking advantage of the fact that there was no one in the shop, Li untied his belt and hanged himself from the railing of the back staircase in the living room. It was not until 6:00 PM, when the craftsmen returned to the shop, that they discovered Li had already died. They immediately reported to the French Concession police, who dispatched detectives to investigate. After the investigation, the body was taken down and sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch for examination.</p>
<h3>Waiter Dies Tragically; Accountant at Theater Is Extremely Arrogant; Resulting in a Fatal Assault by a Mob</h3>
<p>Li Pansheng, a 44-year-old from Wuxi with a robust build, worked as a food delivery man at the Dalichun Restaurant at No. 427, below the Great World Entertainment Center on Mintiniyin Road in the French Concession. At around 8:00 PM on the 12th of this month, some spectators at the Shaoxing Opera troupe on the third floor of the Great World called for snacks from Dalichun. When Li delivered them to the Shaoxing Opera theater, he suddenly had a verbal dispute with Huang Rutang, a 27-year-old accountant from Ningbo. He was immediately grabbed and a group of companions were summoned to assault him, knocking Li to the ground and kicking him, causing internal injuries. After people dispersed the crowd, Li went to the Baolong Hospital on Baker Road for treatment. After learning about this, Dalichun Restaurant reported it to the French Concession police, who dispatched detectives to arrest the perpetrator Huang Rutang. However, Li's injuries were too severe and he died at 6:45 AM yesterday morning. The hospital reported this to the Xinzha Police Station, which notified the French Concession police, who dispatched detectives to take the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch for examination, and will report to the Special Second Court today for the dispatch of personnel to examine the body.</p>
<h3>Grand God Welcoming Festival in Pudong Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to Huadong News Agency, yesterday was the date for the festival of the Sheji Temple (also known as Zhao Zhuang Temple) in the northern border of the Nanhui County territory in Pudong, adjacent to Shanghai and Chuansha County. This festival is the most enthusiastic and grand in Pudong. The number of participants is over a thousand. The route passes through the three counties of Shangnan, Chuan, and Yi. Because almost all professions are represented among the participants, people call it the "Three Hundred and Sixty Trades," but in reality, there are more than three hundred and sixty trades. The festival began at 10:00 AM yesterday and will not be completed until the day after tomorrow. Not only have all the heads of various associations in Pudong been gathered, but also those from as far as Suzhou and Hangzhou have been hired from afar. Wherever the procession passes, the villagers raise funds to set up temporary pavilions, called "she chang." The "she chang" in Yangjing, initiated by a Mr. Pan, displays the most items, showcasing various exotic treasures to each other. It is said that admission tickets were specially issued in advance to limit the number of spectators and avoid overcrowding. This action not only caused a sensation among the people of Pudong, but also attracted citizens from Shanghai and those as far away as Suzhou, Hangzhou, Beijing, and Zhenjiang to come and watch from afar. Three days ago, the roads in Pudong were already crowded with people going to stay with relatives' homes to prepare to watch this grand event. By yesterday morning, the number of people was even more astonishing. Since 6:00 AM, when the sky had just begun to dawn, the men, women, old and young crossing from Shanghai to Pudong were already crowded beyond capacity. The Dongchang Road Wharf in the 16th District and the Dongjiadu Wharf in the Nanshi District were packed with men and women watching the festival. All ferries, although exceeding the legal number of passengers, were constantly shuttling back and forth, but were still insufficient. Therefore, sampans and cargo ships in the Huangpu River also temporarily carried passengers. In total, hundreds of thousands of people crossed from Shanghai to Pudong to watch the spectacle. The scale of the event can be imagined. During the ferry rides, the situation of people squeezing and snatching positions was extremely dangerous, and some fell into the river. For a time, traffic on the Huangpu River was disrupted. This situation only slightly improved before 12:00 noon. However, in the important towns of Pudong, Tangqiao, and Yangjing, men and women could be seen thronging through the streets like a tide. Such a situation was truly rare. Due to the circumstances, the police could not maintain the original traffic order. It is said that this festival was also held once eighteen years ago, and although the scale was also sensational at the time, it cannot be compared to today's event.</p>
<h3>Zhongfa Pharmacy's Discount Ends on the 17th</h3>
<p>Zhongfa Pharmacy is holding a two-week children's festival discount with large gifts, starting from the 4th of this month, to promote children's health and well-being.

Children who seek medical treatment during this discount period, every day from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM, will be exempt from consultation fees. The period is coming to an end, so parents with sick children should not miss this opportunity.</p>
<h3>Special Medicines for Both Male Hemorrhoids and Female Leukorrhea</h3>
<p>"Nine out of ten men have hemorrhoids, and nine out of ten women have leukorrhea" has almost become the norm. However, hemorrhoids are mostly caused by constipation.

<h3>Jiangwan Six-Mile Cross-Country Run: Shanglian Jia Team Achieves Double Victory; Ennis and Russian Émigré Team Rank Third; Individual First Place Goes to Shanglian's Wang Zhenglin; First Time in Thirty Years a Chinese National Wins the Championship</h3>
<p>Since the Jiangwan Six-Mile Cross-Country Race began in 1904, although our side has competed with foreign nationals each time, we have never fallen behind, but we have never won a championship. This year's race was held by the Westerners' Sports Association at 10:30 yesterday morning in Hongkou Park. In order to wash away the shame of the past, our country specially gathered elite warriors from all over the country to form the Shanglian Team to compete against them, putting all our efforts into a last-ditch battle. Fortunately, the soldiers fought bravely, and those who provided support were enthusiastic, so we actually swept both the team and individual championships. "Skinny Monkey" Wang Zhengcai won the championship in one breath. Russian émigré team member Daif Qinggu was second. The next three places were also taken by us. According to the Huadong News Agency reporter's investigation, out of the 16 winners, Chinese people accounted for seven. After the Donghua football team won four championships in a row, there is another great joy. This year is truly the year of Chinese championships.</p>
<p>Dawn's Misty Light, Athletes Gather</p>
<p>The night before the cross-country race, the weather was bad, and it rained heavily all night. Only this morning did the heavy rain stop. In front of the Hongkou Park, with its beautiful scenery, the early spring was clearing up, making the weather feel even more bright, clear, and beautiful, increasing people's excitement. Therefore, after nine o'clock, those who went to watch were already shoulder to shoulder. At that time, the 84 members of the 15 teams participating in the cross-country race, as well as the 14 individual participants, arrived one after another. By ten o'clock, everyone had arrived and immediately dressed and took to the field. Each athlete was brave and eager, rubbing their fists and wiping their palms in preparation. Our side had a total of six teams participating, all full of energy. Although the competition had not yet started, we were quite confident in seizing victory because the performance of each team was different from the past.</p>

<p>Wang Zhenglin Takes the Lead After the Start</p>
<p>At half past ten, all 98 athletes gathered at the west gate of Hongkou Park. After the starting gun fired, each team member rushed forward like falcons. Our "Skinny Monkey" Wang Zhenglin took the lead from afar. Lie Fuqinggu, although he stepped on the gas, still found it difficult to take the lead. Along the swimming pool, they turned into East Sports Association Road. At this time, the broad avenue had ended, and they were all on rugged, narrow paths. After the heavy rain last night, the ground had not dried, and the road was muddy and unbearable. Our athletes suffered quite a bit from slipping and falling. However, Wang Zhenglin, Jin Zhongkang, He Baoshan, Zhang Liang, and others were all veterans of the field, unafraid of difficulties, persevering, and still taking the lead. They crossed a small wooden bridge and turned east again onto a gravel road, then circled along winding rural paths to Yinxiang Road, heading west, and then entered East Sports Association Road again. At this time, the flat avenue reappeared before our eyes. Our country's team members were all delighted. At this time, Wang Zhenglin was already in the lead. However, the fierce general Lie Fuqinggu of the Russian émigré team was unwilling to show weakness and bravely caught up. At the small wooden bridge of the Sports Association, he was already neck and neck with Wang. The spectators along the way thought that Lie had overwhelmed Wang Zhenglin's second place with his first place at last year's World Games. Meeting again this time, Wang might not be able to resist, and everyone was worried for Wang. Behind them were Shanglian team members Cheng Hanzhang and Zhang Liang chasing closely, followed by Russian émigré team members Qieqie Lie Fu and Ennis team members Bairang, Satesheng, and Weiersheng, who were slightly behind but still pushing forward.</p>
<p>Joyful "Skinny Monkey" Wins the Championship</p>
<p>From East Sports Association Road to the section of the wooden bridge towards the swimming pool, the Chinese team athletes showed their skills. Wang Zhenglin fought with all his strength and finally surpassed Lie Fuqinggu, taking the lead all the way. At around 11 o'clock, he had reached the side gate, taking a total of 30 minutes and 8 seconds to reach the finish line. Later, Lie Fuqinggu also rushed to arrive, creating the runner-up. One second later, He Baoshan also caught up, followed by Zhang Liang, and then Jin Zhongkang and Russian émigré Qieqie Lie Fu, shoulder to shoulder. When they were about to reach the finish line, Jin jumped forward, taking fifth place, and Qieqie Lie Fu finished sixth. The seventh and eighth places were Bo Si and Weiersheng of the Ennis team. The ninth place was Wu Hanzhang of the Shanglian team, and the tenth place was Xu Tianzhang of the Hongkou Cross-Country Team. After that were the athletes of our side and the Ennis team.</p>
<p>We Take the Lead in Both Events</p>
<p>The competition started at half past ten, and Wang Zhenglin arrived at eight minutes past eleven. Other generals arrived around ten minutes past eleven. Therefore, the individual and team scores were determined as follows: First place: Wang Zhenglin (Shanglian Team); Second place: Lie Fuqinggu (Russian Émigré Team); Third place: He Baoshan (Shanglian Team); Fourth place: Zhang Liang (Shanglian Team); Fifth place: Jin Zhongkang (Shanglian Team); Sixth place: Qieqie Lie Fu (Russian Émigré Team); Seventh place: Bo Si (Ennis Team); Eighth place: Weiersheng (Ennis Team); Ninth place: Wu Hanzhang (Shanglian Team); Tenth place: Xu Guozhang (Hongkou Cross-Country Team); Eleventh place: Niu Qibao (Ennis Team); Twelfth place: Bairang (Ennis Team); Thirteenth place: Satesheng (Ennis); Fourteenth place: Mai Yang (Ennis Team); Fifteenth place: Mai Laohui (Ennis Team); Sixteenth place: Gu Huaiyuan (Shanglian Team) (The above Shanglian Team is the A Team). In the team competition, the Shanglian Team was first with a total of 13 points, Ennis was second with a total of 38 points, and the Russian Émigré Team was third with a total of 56 points. There were 15 groups and 84 people participating, including the Western Sports Association A, Ennis A, Shanglian A, Russian Émigré, French Army A, Chinese Sports Association, Ennis B, Hongkou Cross-Country Team, Ennis C, French Army, Huaguang, Western Sports Association B, Ennis D, Shanglian B, etc., and a total of 98 people including individual participants.</p>
<p>Shanglian Wins the Championship Trophy</p>
<p>At half past eleven, the chairman of the Western Sports Association took the stage to present the awards. The Shanglian Team, Ennis Team, and Russian Émigré Team were the first to receive the team awards, followed by the individual winners. Both the team and individual championships were won by our side. Wang Zhenglin received the championship trophy amidst cheers.</p>
<p>A List of Past Championship Winners</p>
<p>The Jianglan Cross-Country Race was founded in 1904, along with the International Walking Race. The championship winners from 1904 to 1926 were mostly European, so they have all been lost. It was held in 1927, and the individual championship was won by Qiu Fei (Englishman) of the Beds and Her team. In 1928, it was Zhu Sai. In 1929, the individual championship was won by Haishi Shuoni, and the British championship was won by Gelaige, a member of the Lancashire British Army team. The team was the Russian Émigré Team. In 1934, the individual championship was Wei Ci, a member of the British Army Huasais team, and the team was also the Huasais team. This year's individual and team championships were won by our country's Shanglian Team. In addition, according to the records of previous sessions, the individual scores were all between 31 and 32.3 minutes, and the team scores were around 20 points. Only this year's individual score of Wang Zhenglin of our country's Shanglian Team was 30 minutes and 8 seconds, and the team score was 13 points, both breaking previous records, which is extremely glorious.</p>

<h3>First Battle of the Southern Volleyball Expedition: Nanmin Victorious; Dongya Loses 1-3; Tense Situation, Close Scores; Rematch Against Fudan at 3:00 PM Today</h3>
<p>The Tianjin Nanmin Team, the volleyball champion of North China, clashed with the Dongya Vocational School Volleyball Team at the Dongya Gymnasium at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. This was the team's first performance in Shanghai. In the competition, Nanmin was indeed the volleyball champion of North China, but Dongya was a newborn calf that did not fear the tiger. The match was exceptionally exciting, creating a tense situation, and the scores were always close. As a result, the score was 3-1, so Dongya's defeat was also comforting.</p>
<p>Nanmin's Strength</p>
<p>The Nanmin team members were all skilled and good at fighting. The three in the front row, Wang Shaocheng, Ate Li, and Chui, were particularly impressive. This person was tall and powerful, with advantages in smashing and spiking. Therefore, his arm was raised, and Asia shrank back. Connoisseurs said that this person had the style of the tall Zhang Xihu. Jin Adu and Liu Haoshen guarded left and right, and their ball-setting skills were superior. The second row, Feng Dean, Guan Dongshu, and Lou Guangfu, used their smashing and counterattacking skills to make the enemy fearful. The third row was exceptionally stable, connecting with the first and second rows in the middle, which was excellent. The whole team was very connected, and its strength was also very impressive. As for Dongya, Yang Dilin was the main pillar, and his smashing skills were not inferior to Wang Shaocheng.</p>
<p>Match Details</p>
<p>At the beginning of the first set, Nanmin served first and scored two points. Dongya immediately returned the color, but before long, Nanmin took a commanding lead with 11 to 3. Dongya was unable to resist the arrogance, so Nanmin easily won the first set with 21 to 13. In the second set, Dongya cheered up, and Yang Dilin, Xie Yongyuan, and Lin Zhenxin repeatedly applied pressure and spikes in front of the net, and their momentum was like a broken bamboo. Finally, they won back the second set with 21 to 16. In the third set, Nanmin used all their strength. After playing to 14 to 12, Wang Shaocheng performed his signature move, raising his arm and succeeding in every move, adding seven points in a row. Nanmin then won the third set with 21 to 16. The fourth set was about life and death, and both sides were very careful. Wang Shaocheng and his teammates would strongly spike when they got the chance, and Dongya also fought back with all their strength. The scores were very close, 17 to 14, 20 to 19, and even 21 to 16. Nanmin won the fourth set again.</p>

<h3>Sino-Foreign Cultural Association Established Yesterday, Elected Jiang Kanghu and Other Directors</h3>
<p>The Sino-Foreign Cultural Association, after lengthy preparations, held its inaugural meeting yesterday at 2:30 PM on the ninth floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA. More than fifty members and Chinese and foreign guests attended. Bingzhu Stenography Agency provided stenographic services. The Shanghai News reporter's account of the proceedings is as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees</p>
<p>Included Jiang Kanghu, Tao Baichuan, He Zhenya, Hu Huaichen, Du Gangbai, Wang Longzhang, Huang Xianzhang, Tan Yunshan, Wu Kaisheng, Yang Bingxun, Huang Jingwan, Wang Bolun, Chen Peide, Yao Mingda, Jin Guobao, Cao Wenxie, Huang Zitong, Wu Zijing, and Wang Longzhang, representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters; foreign guests included Japanese nationals Sakamoto and Matsumoto; Hungarian Lainar; American Merrill; Persian Duda; Dutch Woolf; and German Grinff, totaling over fifty people.</p>
<p>Establishment Circumstances</p>
<p>The presidium consisted of Jiang Kanghu, Tao Baichuan, He Zhenya, Du Gangbai, Tan Yunshan, Zhao Jinlin, and Lu Ganchen; Chen Peide served as the recorder. After performing the customary rituals, Chairman Jiang Kanghu delivered the opening remarks and reported on the preparations. Municipal Party Headquarters representative Wang Longzhang then gave a speech. Guests Huang Xianzhang, Wu Kaisheng, Lainar, Sakamoto, Merrill, Duda, Woolf, and Grinff followed with speeches. The charter was then discussed, officers were elected, and the meeting adjourned after a group photograph.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Chairman Jiang Kanghu, in his opening remarks, briefly stated that the Sino-Foreign Cultural Association had been in preparation for a long time and was being established today. The association's purpose is to recognize that China has a culture and that Chinese culture has great value in the world. It is hoped that countries with cultures around the world will understand Chinese culture. Therefore, the first step is to organize Chinese culture to introduce it to the world. On the other hand, they also acknowledge that Chinese culture has shortcomings that need to be remedied by adopting foreign cultures. However, whether foreign cultures can all be brought in is questionable. Therefore, the second task is to select foreign cultures to remedy the shortcomings of Chinese culture based on the principle of adapting to the Chinese position. The Sino-Foreign Cultural Association has a wide scope. There is a basic unit in the association, which is the sub-committee, initiated by the Chinese and sponsored by foreigners. More than ten types have been established. In the future, they will also contact international groups and cultural groups to carry out the work.</p>
<p>Party Headquarters' Address</p>
<p>Municipal Party Headquarters representative Wang Longzhang stated briefly that the Sino-Foreign Cultural Association's inaugural meeting was held during a period of heated discussion about cultural movements in the country. He was very pleased to participate on behalf of the Municipal Party Headquarters. The scope of culture is very broad, including all political economy, and even all social phenomena. Chinese people have two extreme tendencies when it comes to culture: one is conservative, and the other is blindly following. The former only asks about time and ignores space, while the latter only cares about space and ignores time. Neither of these views is correct. They must abandon the dross and preserve the essence of Chinese culture from a vertical perspective, and take the strengths from foreign cultures from a horizontal perspective. Only by taking both into account can they build a new Chinese culture. The purpose of the Sino-Foreign Cultural Association is exactly in line with this. He hoped that the association would work hard to achieve it.</p>
<p>Guest Speeches</p>
<p>(1) Huang Xianzhang spoke, hoping that the Sino-Foreign Cultural Association would harmonize China's spiritual civilization with foreign material civilization. (2) Wu Kaisheng spoke, stating that they should pay attention to foreign science to remedy China's shortcomings. (3) Hungarian doctor Lainar spoke, representing the Hungarians in Shanghai to celebrate the establishment of the association. The Sino-Hungarian Cultural Association is currently being prepared and is scheduled to be established on the 16th of this month. In the future, there will be great progress in communicating Sino-Hungarian culture. (4) Japanese Dr. Sakamoto spoke, stating that Chinese culture has a very close relationship. Japan received Chinese culture earlier than Roman culture. Japanese moral concepts are influenced by Confucius. Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness are the highest standards of human morality, which the Japanese admire very much. He hoped that the association would strive to further the close relationship between Chinese and Japanese cultures and promote friendship between the two countries. (5) American Merrill (Guangxue Society) spoke in Chinese, stating that he has been in China for twenty-eight years and has considerable knowledge of the Chinese Four Books and Five Classics. He feels that Chinese culture is very valuable. At present, there are often unfortunate events because Chinese and foreigners cannot recognize and understand each other. He hopes that the association can work hard to achieve the goal of communicating Chinese and foreign cultures. (6) Persian Duda (Jianghai Customs) spoke in Chinese, stating that he has been in China for more than twenty years and can be said to be a Chinese. He understands everything in China very well. Many foreigners think that foreign things are good and Chinese things are bad, which is wrong. (7) Dutch Consul Woolf spoke, hoping that the Dutch in Shanghai and the Chinese students in the Netherlands would work together to join the association to cooperate in Sino-Dutch culture. (8) German reporter Grinff spoke, stating that Germans admire Chinese Confucianism very much. There are many Sino-German cultural groups now. He hoped that the association would have a deep understanding to promote Sino-German culture. Tan Yunshan's response was omitted.</p>
<p>Election of Directors</p>
<p>After passing the charter, the selection of members of the various committees was discussed, and directors were elected. Jiang Kanghu, Tao Baichuan, Tan Yunshan, Lu Ganchen, Wang Longzhang, He Zhenya, Hu Huaichen, Huang Jingwan, Dai Pengtian, Wu Kaisheng, and Du Gangbai were elected as directors, and Cao Wenxie, Wei Juxian, Yang Bingxun, and Zhou Huan were elected as alternate directors.</p>

<h3>Fan Zhongyun Speaks on How to Study International Politics: Two Questions Before Studying International Politics; Seven Conditions When Studying International Politics</h3>
<p>The National Reading Movement Conference, sponsored by the China Cultural Construction Association, specially invited Fan Zhongyun to speak on "How to Study International Politics" at the Sino-Western Radio Station. The original speech is as follows:</p>
<p>Epistemology of International Politics</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, today is the National Reading Movement Conference sponsored by the China Cultural Construction Association. I am specially invited to speak on how to study international politics. Now, due to time constraints, I will briefly talk to you about it. To study international politics, you must first understand what is called international politics and why you should study international politics. After understanding these two questions, you can talk about how to study international politics. The simplest explanation of international politics is a discipline that studies the political relations between countries. This discipline only emerged in modern times. In the past, when transportation was inconvenient and civilization was underdeveloped, relations between countries could not arise, and international politics could not be discussed. For example, in ancient China, Europe and the United States did not know that China existed, and China did not know that Europe and the United States existed. Since relations did not arise, international politics could not be discussed. Now, however, it is different. Whether it is food, clothing, housing, or transportation, China cannot escape from Europe and the United States. Taking kerosene as an example, our country relies on foreign countries. The occurrence of gold and silver storms also caused harm to China. At present, all countries have formed a link in the world. The countries of the world have formed a whole, indivisible group. The complexity of relations between countries is increasing day by day. The importance of studying international politics is becoming increasingly felt. The above is an explanation of international politics and the need to study international politics, which can be called the epistemology of studying international politics.</p>
<p>Methodology of International Politics</p>
<p>How to study international politics can be called the methodology of studying international politics. The first condition for studying international politics is the preparation of modern history. At least, a clear study of the historical knowledge of the world and China in the past 100 years is essential. Taking world history as an example, the causes of World War I, the world politics before the war, the situation of the world division after the war, and the post-war situations of the victorious and defeated countries should all be studied clearly and not ignored. It must be known that modern European history seems to be the affair of the European countries on the surface, but in fact it has controlled the entire world. For example, the Russo-Japanese War was caused by the diplomatic skills of German Chancellor Bismarck. Russia's eastward expansion was due to Bismarck's instigation. Bismarck supported Russia on the one hand, and on the other hand, he was actually using a strategy of diverting the tiger away from the mountain. Germany could fully cope with France. Because of the Russo-Japanese War, the countries of the Far East, especially our country, suffered greatly. Therefore, they feel more urgently the study of international politics, and the preparation of modern history cannot be ignored. The second is the preparation of economic common sense. In the past, it was thought that politics could dominate the economy, but now it is not. Politics is absolutely dominated by the economy. This situation became more obvious after the European War. Modern European and American countries are all imperialist countries. The reason is that the final stage of the development of capitalism is the formation of imperialism. What is needed is a market for selling goods. Politics is driven by the economy. Various economic demands form various political policies of the country. Therefore, the preparation of economic common sense is necessary. Moreover, modern political science is completely different from past economics. Taking currency as an example, the main condition of currency in the past was credit, that is, the ability to redeem. Now, due to the world economic panic and weak purchasing power, even currency inflation policies are used, disregarding credit and inability to redeem, in order to devalue the currency and sell their domestic goods. Therefore, full preparation for economics is also indispensable. Third, the preparation of international politics. Between modern countries, on the one hand, they are exhausting their efforts and sincerely harming others and benefiting themselves. At the same time, they are recuperating and easing the sharpening of conflicts. They are also trying their best to seek compromise. Therefore, on the one hand, countries are devoting themselves to currency competition, and at the same time, they are also holding currency conferences and requesting coordination. The so-called international economic conferences have all arisen from this. To understand and recognize, it is necessary to study international law, etc. Fourth, there should be an understanding of newspapers and factions. The acquisition of international materials is naturally newspapers, but newspapers often have factions as their background. Because they have a background, the truth is often difficult to obtain. We must understand their background in order to obtain their original meaning. The above four points are the basic conditions for the method of studying international politics, and none is indispensable.</p>

<p>Lixin Accounting Tutoring School at 190 Ningbo Road in the city, founded by accountant Dr. Pan Xulun, has been established for seven and a half years. It originally consisted of two departments: correspondence and night school. The correspondence department enrolls students year-round, and students can enroll at any time. The night school department has one session every six months. The 15th session is already two months into classes, and the next session will not be recruited until early September. It is reported that the school, in view of the large number of people who want to enroll and the increasingly hot weather, will use the time of leisure in the early morning to add morning classes for each subject, from 7:00 AM to 8:20 AM, so that those who are enthusiastic about learning accounting and convenient in the morning can enroll. The classes offered are divided into two groups: bookkeeping and accounting. The bookkeeping group is divided into two subjects: elementary bookkeeping and advanced bookkeeping. The accounting group is divided into three subjects: advanced accounting, bank accounting, and cost accounting. Elementary bookkeeping and bank accounting classes are held twice a week, and the remaining three subjects are held four times a week. The study period is set for four and a half months. This session is scheduled to start on May 10th, and registration begins immediately. Detailed information will be sent upon request by mail.</p>

<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Yunshang)</p>
<p>The word "modern" has become a very common noun in Shanghai, meaning fashionable. Yesterday, I happened to find the word "modern" in a quaint Diamond Sutra. However, if its meaning is thoroughly explained, I think none of the ladies in Shanghai would willingly consider themselves modern. Let me first transcribe the original text from the Diamond Sutra:</p>
<p>The Diamond Sutra states: "Shakyamuni's disciple Ananda encountered the Matangi woman and was taken into a lewd chamber, about to destroy his precepts." The note says, "Matangi is named Prakrti, a lewd woman." Then how could Ananda, a disciple of Buddhism, be taken away by a lewd woman? Perhaps this Matangi woman did have a particularly mesmerizing lewd power. So I further examined what Buddha Ananda was. Buddhist scriptures explain him as the Joyful Buddha. There is still a statue of the Joyful Buddha in the Yonghe Temple in Beijing. The Joyful Buddha and the lewd woman participating in the Joyful Chan are still common sense. Buddhist books also say: "Men are called Matanga. Women are called Matangi." The note says, "Lewd men and lewd women." Alas! According to this, the word "modern" does indeed mean lewd. Will the general modern girls of Shanghai scold me for being a gossip after reading this article?</p>
<h3>Culinary Ramblings</h3>
<p>— Wanlu</p>
<p>The Chu poet's "eating the fallen petals of autumn chrysanthemums" is nothing more than a metaphor for a beautiful person's fragrant herbs expressing sorrow. I don't know that there are actually several kinds of flowers that can be eaten. Now I will briefly list them as follows:</p>
<p>Chrysanthemum: The taste is originally sweet and fragrant. Since the Songs of Chu, those who admire elegance have mostly used it as a refined item for autumn banquets. The name "flower hotpot" has been around for a long time! Chrysanthemums come in many colors, but only white ones are edible. The rest are poisonous. In addition to chrysanthemum hotpot, there are those who use chrysanthemum petals to season crab soup, which tastes particularly excellent. However, none of them are as wonderful as the Lingnan chrysanthemum candy: the method of making it is to take a small cube of fatty meat, the size of a chess piece, refine it with rock sugar, and spread the dried chrysanthemum petals on the sugar, looking like the first bloom of chrysanthemum stamens. Chewing it is fragrant, sweet, and rich. It can be said that its shape, color, fragrance, and taste have all reached a wonderful realm.</p>
<p>Magnolia: Magnolia petals are as large as lotus petals, with a pure white color and a rich fragrance. A tree in front of the courtyard smells like rouge and powder. Pick the newly opened flower petals, wash away the pollen, and cut off the root of the petals connected to the stem (otherwise it will taste bitter). Cut them into wide strips, mix them with egg flour and rock sugar to form a paste. Dip the flower petals in the paste, pan-fry them slightly, and eat them. They are fragrant and sweet.</p>
<p>Night-blooming jasmine: Lingnan night-blooming jasmine is as large as wisteria. In early spring, it produces tender seedlings and buds. Pick the seedlings, boil them in boiling soup, and then stir-fry them in a wok. They can be used as a side dish and have a good flavor. They are especially crisp and refreshing! It is also good for cold dishes. In the inland, this flower is cultivated as a precious jade tree. Who can bear to do this thing of boiling a crane and burning a qin? Naturally, only the Cantonese have this heroic act, but it is not necessarily the flower's misfortune!</p>
<p>Wisteria: In early summer, pick its tender pistils, those that are just showing a slight purple color: lightly scald them with boiling water, and the color will fade immediately. Use it to cook meat, and it will have a slight fragrance. If you stir it into a paste with egg flour, spread it and fry it, and eat it with rock sugar, the taste is especially delicious.</p>
<p>In addition, such as osmanthus and roses, can be made into sugar jam, or pickled with rock sugar and made into a filling for pastries, but their fragrant aroma is pleasant, and it is not truly enough to quickly eat a lot of it.</p>

<p>Golden Fish News My friend Xu Hejun, is the nephew of Mr. Xu Qiu, the former Commissioner for Foreign Affairs of Jiangsu. Recently, he acquired several acres of land on Qingyun Road in Zhabei and established a fish farm at his own expense, named Shanghai Golden Fish Garden. The garden has four ponds, thirty-two Jiangchi pools, and more than one hundred and eighty yellow sand tanks, making it a giant among them. Once the eggs hatch, they will be sold immediately. It is reported that Mr. Xu plans to set the price especially low, in order to popularize it among those who love goldfish.</p>

<h3>Lawyer Xu and Dancing</h3>
<p>— Pillow Green</p>
<p>Last year around this time, in the spring, Lawyer Xu often came to my house in the evenings to chat. Once, when we were talking about the flourishing state of dance halls, I said:</p>
<p>"Now that so many dance halls have opened, and their business isn't bad, they seem to be keeping pace with movie theaters. It shows how leisurely and extravagant society has become. I know you enjoy watching movies, Mr. Xu, but I wonder what your opinion is on dancing, considering you are such a versatile and playful young man?"</p>
<p>"Speaking of that, it makes me angry! Aren't dance halls just wide-open traps? As for visiting prostitutes, many of the upper class don't want to risk their reputation, or are afraid of syphilis. And without an introduction from someone you know, you can't go to a brothel. But these places, the doors are wide open, anyone can enter. At first, the costs are low, but gradually you become lost and can't turn back. Isn't it even more convenient and widespread than prostitution?</p>
<p>"A group of dancing girls, each with fair skin and rosy cheeks, high heels, waiting to serve others – the number of steps they dance in one night is more than walking from Risheng Building to Gaochang Temple, yet at the same time, how many happy families and young people's futures are they destroying? Who knows, perhaps the very people here are the ones on whose shoulders rests the future revival of the nation and the creation of a better society!</p>
<p>"Just look at dancing, which civilized people consider noble and respectable. A man and a woman embracing each other physically, performing slow, coordinated movements back and forth, is no different from the things people consider unmentionable in the bedroom. Yet pairs gather in public, in a great hall, openly performing, the only difference being that they are standing and separated by clothing with gaps!</p>
<p>"That place, those people, that activity – is there anything about it that isn't bad? I was once forced by a friend to visit and take a look, and it only confirmed and strengthened my opinion. What's the fun in seeking such entertainment? If I were a local official, I would have banned all these dance halls a long time ago!"</p>
<p>This year around this time, again in the spring, Lawyer Xu, who hadn't visited my house in a long time, suddenly came by one evening. After a few words of conversation, he glanced at his watch and said casually:</p>
<p>"Shall we go to a dance hall? Someone is waiting for me at the Yangtze at 8:30!"</p>
<p>"What important business is it? You dance too?" I asked, with a look of surprise.</p>
<p>"Ah! You didn't know? I'm deeply addicted to dancing! Every day, I sit in the office, and as soon as I hear the evening newspaper being delivered, I immediately become restless and distracted, my mind wandering to places with dim lights, soft music, and crisscrossing skirts and shoes! Sometimes I rush to several places in one night, and I don't feel tired at all. If I don't go one night, I feel weak and exhausted, as if suffering from a serious illness, or as if I've lost something priceless! On the one hand, I still feel that it is a tempting den of vice, but on the other hand, I can't help but treat it as a stimulant. Isn't that a strange and contradictory state of mind?" As he spoke, he unconsciously tapped the soles of his leather shoes alternately, as if mimicking the rhythm of the drums that stir people's hearts in the dance halls. Then, his waist swayed slightly, as if he was about to get up and dance upon hearing the rooster's crow.</p>
<p>It turns out that a person's will can change so quickly and drastically, beyond anyone's expectations. Therefore, no one can guarantee anything about themselves, not even in the near future, and certainly not until the coffin lid is closed!</p>
<h3>Little Western Heaven</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 12: Ashamed of Having No Clothes, She Hides from Guests Behind Curtains, Diligently Saves Lamp Oil, and Copies Books at Dawn</p>
<p>Sister-in-law Hu said, "You with big feet are worse than those with bound feet. If I didn't fall, how could you have fallen?" Huanhua said, "Master Jia is waiting for you to eat in front. Why do you always make things so difficult? You should know that we're soaked in rain, not trying to get anything for ourselves. We're just trying to find a way out for you, so you can settle down. Making things like this, really makes it difficult for us." Zhichian heard her speaking with a southern accent, and also based on the way she was dressed, and based on how they were doing this, he could see what kind of person she was. So he laughed and said, "Madam, what you're saying doesn't sound like you're trying to understand others. If she wasn't suffering from a mental illness, why would she willingly throw herself into the mud? This is something she doesn't want to do. Why do you blame her?" Yang Huanhua glanced at Zhichian, thinking that this man was not bad. Although she received two sentences from him, it was not necessary to get angry, so she laughed and said, "Sir, you don't know, all she has left is the clothes on her back. Now they're all wet, so where can she find clothes to change into? That's not all, she also has an appointment with someone, so she can't go." Zhichian laughed and said, "It doesn't matter if the appointment is delayed. If you don't let her change her clothes, it's so cold that she might get sick. People's skin isn't made of iron. If you soak in this cold mud for too long, what would happen to you?" If he hadn't said these words, it wouldn't have mattered, but after he said that, Yueying burst into tears. When she cried, her chest rose and fell, and her shoulders kept shrugging. Zhichian took two steps back and said, "Madam, if you cry, I don't know what to do, because it looks like I provoked you."

<h3>A Brief History of Walker, a Stalwart of the American Press</h3>
<p>— Special</p>
<p>The New York Times is one of the most powerful newspapers in the United States, and also one of the most influential newspapers in the world. Its owner, Walker, passed away on the 8th of this month at the age of seventy-seven. His life story can serve as a model for our young friends. Now, I will write about it briefly below.</p>
<p>Walker was born on March 12, 1858. His father was an officer in the American Civil War and later did business in Knoxville. Walker only received elementary school education because of his poor family. After leaving school, he delivered newspapers for the Knoxville Chronicle. At the age of seventeen, he entered the newspaper office as a printer's assistant, earning two dollars a week. Later, he worked in the printing department of the St. Louis Post. In less than a year, he transferred to the typesetting department of the Knoxville Town Forum Daily. At the age of nineteen, he began working with the Chattanooga City Daily Express. He worked diligently and used his spare time to study on his own. Therefore, he had held positions in all departments of the newspaper office, from the printing department to the editor-in-chief. The following year, he published a directory of Chattanooga, which was the starting point for his lifelong career success. At the age of twenty-five, he married the daughter of Dr. Isaac, a Doctor of Theology. They only had one daughter, who later married Soursberger, the Deputy Director of the New York Times Company. He used the money he earned from publishing the directory to buy half of the profits of the Chattanooga Times for one thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars, but he only paid two hundred and fifty dollars in cash. Thus, the hero had a place to display his talents. He used his strong will and worked hard to manage the business, and the business of the newspaper office flourished. Two years later, he bought the remaining half for seven thousand five hundred dollars. Within a few years, the Chattanooga Times became an influential newspaper.</p>
<p>In 1896, when Walker was thirty-eight years old, he also bought the New York Times. At that time, the newspaper was the most corrupt among all newspapers in the United States and was gradually heading towards extinction. After Walker bought it, he relied on his talent and honesty to solve the problems that other experienced publishers considered difficult to deal with. The weakness of the newspaper's finances at that time can be seen from his conversation with people several years later. He said, "Not long after I took over, there were some shares, each sold for only one dime. The lowness of its value can be imagined." He worked hard for three years, and the New York Times was able to make a profit. From then on, he became the main leader of the entire newspaper office. The newspaper office, which had the smallest business among the daily newspapers in New York City, gradually developed after his reorganization, and its business became the most successful among all newspapers in the city. When he reorganized the New York Times, there were only about a hundred employees in the newspaper office, and the daily circulation was less than twenty thousand copies, and the annual gross income was about five hundred thousand dollars. He used the policy of running the Chattanooga Times to operate the New York Times, and the effect he achieved was the same. When he took over a newspaper, he rarely changed the old employees and treated people with generosity, so everyone was willing to work hard for him. Dr. Michael, a famous reporter for the Brooklyn Eagle, once praised Walker's great achievements, saying that it was unprecedented in the history of American newspapers.</p>
<p>In 1928, when Walker celebrated his 50th anniversary in the publishing industry, the New York Times had increased to more than three thousand three hundred employees, and the daily circulation was more than four hundred thousand copies. The circulation of the Sunday edition exceeded seven hundred thousand copies, and the annual income exceeded twenty-five million dollars.</p>
<p>Over the years, the content of the New York Times has progressed with its business development. All major cities in the United States have special correspondents. The newspaper also focuses on foreign news, so it has offices and reporters in all major cities in the world. The New York Times was the first daily newspaper in the United States to use rotary presses to print pictures, and it was also the first to use wireless transmission of news. The newspaper office has run many great projects, especially focusing on North and South Pole expeditions and rewarding aviation.</p>
<p>Walker's policy of running the newspaper, in a nutshell, is "Beneficial news, all published." He also used this principle for advertising and editorials. The success of his life's career was of course based on his talent, but at the beginning, it was due to the words "thrift and diligence."</p>

<h3>The Problem of Lecithin for Quitting Smoking (The Problem of Lipoid Substance for Quitting Smoking)</h3>
<p>— Pang Jingzhou</p>
<p>Explanation to the Public – Introduction to Medical Professionals</p>
<p>(1) Introduction</p>
<p>Since the National Government strictly enforced the ban on smoking, smokers were truly "all determined to quit." It just so happened that the new drug for quitting smoking, lecithin, was promoted from Nanjing to Shanghai last winter and spring. For a time, society was discussing lecithin, with some praising it, some doubting it, and some rejecting it. It was chaotic and lively. I know a little about this method of quitting smoking, and I received countless phone calls asking about it day and night. Even colleagues from various places sent letters to inquire. It was overwhelming. Unscrupulous pharmaceutical merchants had already engaged in a speculative and profit-seeking scheme, advertising soy lecithin and claiming it helps to quit smoking. Enthusiastic industrialists were already thinking about raising capital and manufacturing large quantities of lecithin to rescue blacklisted compatriots. It seemed to have the momentum of a tide. Therefore, some people in the medical field compared quitting smoking with lecithin to the trend of treating lung disease with kerosene last year, calling it the lecithin tide. However, quitting smoking with lecithin is not as absurd as treating lung disease with kerosene. The inventor has his own research work, and lecithin itself has its own medical standing. Using it to quit smoking also has a medical theory. The Ministry of Health rashly sold lecithin, also based on its test results. Now, I will describe the origins of using lecithin to quit opium, so that the public and blacklisted gentlemen can be calm and clear, and medical colleagues can also conduct further exploration. Originally, the progress of all medical issues cannot be achieved overnight. It is important not to get excited and swarm around when you are enthusiastic, and then disappear and collapse later.</p>
<p>(2) What is Lecithin?</p>
<p>Lecithin, originally called Lecithin in academics, is an organic substance belonging to the class of lipoid substances. It is most abundant in egg yolks. The first half of the original name, according to ancient Western writing, means egg. The Chinese Standardization of Chemical Terms also translates it as lecithin. Other animal and plant bodies contain varying amounts of lecithin. Soybeans contain a relatively large amount, so extracting impure lecithin from soybeans is more economical than extracting it from eggs. The chemical formula of lecithin is C44H90NPO9. Because it contains phosphorus, it is usually used by doctors as a tonic and brain-boosting agent. Some doctors have also used it as an injectable lipoid stimulant for tuberculosis, but the amount required is very small. In addition, the products used in industry are extremely crude.</p>
<p>In short, this drug has been around for a long time and was not suddenly invented and specially produced last winter and spring.</p>
<p>(3) Why is Lecithin Used to Quit Smoking?</p>
<p>The application of lecithin to quit smoking originated in the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931), when Dr. Ma Wenzhao was studying physiological chemistry in Peiping. He discovered the influence of morphine poisoning on certain changes in the tissues of animal bodies, and then continued to work in this direction. Dr. Ma's original preliminary test report was in English, published in the Chinese Journal of Physiology, Volume 5, Issue 3, 1931, starting on page 251, and there was a brief translated Chinese title called "Changes in Cells in White Mice with Acute and Chronic Morphine Dependence." Now, I will very briefly write down the main points of Dr. Ma's original work, to fit the popular purpose of this article. As for colleagues who want to study in detail, please refer to the original book.</p>
<p>Dr. Ma used dozens of white mice in two groups, injecting different amounts of morphine to create acute and chronic morphine poisoning in the mice. He also killed a mouse gradually at different times for testing. The results showed that the Golgi apparatus in various organs increased during the excitement period (Kyoto noted that the original name of the Golgi apparatus was Golgi Apparat, which was discovered by Golgi using a staining method, and also short branches of Ganglienzlle, etc., were also discovered by Gao Min. Golgi was born in 1844 and died in 1926, so the Golgi apparatus is not a very fresh thing in medical history). Conversely, it decreased during the white mice's decline period. Therefore, Dr. Ma concluded that the effect of morphine changes with the amount of Golgi apparatus in the body, and it is also consistent with the superficial symptoms of excitement and decline. The Golgi apparatus is a lipoid substance, and the most important lipoid substance is lecithin. So, suppose (A) Can feeding lecithin increase the Golgi apparatus? (B) During the addiction period, when the Golgi apparatus is seen to gradually disappear, can the supplementation of lecithin prevent the disappearance of the Golgi apparatus, thereby avoiding the decline? The results of the feeding test showed that both of the above questions could be answered satisfactorily. Therefore, Dr. Ma used this result as the basis for using lecithin to quit opium addiction.</p>
<p>In short, the origin of lecithin to quit smoking originated three years ago, not just invented last year. It also went through proper animal testing and the necessary steps, not just random attempts or accidental success. As for why Dr. Ma did this test, there were also previous "Pathology of Opium Poisoning" documents as clues, not just an idea that was suddenly and successfully completed.</p>
<p>(4) When did the Lecithin Quitting Method Start to be Tested on Humans?</p>
<p>Since Dr. Ma did the preliminary test, he proceeded to the second step of his work, studying the changes in the blood after chronic morphine poisoning. He used the white blood cells of patients with morphine disease for testing, and the results were the same as those obtained in white mice (published in the Chinese Medical Journal, Volume 46). Secondly, Dr. Ma re-tested nucleated cells - red blood cells and platelets, etc. The main points of the results are as follows:</p>
<p>(A) At the beginning of addiction, red blood cells increase, and neutrophilic granules (Neutrophil) increase, and platelets decrease slightly.</p>
<p>(B) When addicted (i.e., when enough morphine is received), the number of red blood cells and neutrophilic granules decreases, while platelets increase by one to two times or more.</p>
<p>(C) After addiction, the coloring of red blood cells and platelets is slightly pale, appearing to decline. The number of red blood cells decreases first and then increases, and platelets always decrease.</p>
<p>The test results showed that these abnormal changes in the blood can also be corrected by feeding lecithin. This article is published in the Chinese Journal of Physiology, Volume 6, Issue 4, 1932, pages 359 to 390, titled "Changes in Red Blood Cells and Platelets in White Mice After Long-Term Injection of Morphine and Timely Treatment."</p>
<p>At this time, Dr. Ma was experimenting on animals on the one hand, and already applying lecithin to humans on the other hand. It was implemented in the Central Opium Prohibition Committee's Quitting Hospital in Nanjing from June 2 to July 30 in the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931). The hospital had 43 beds and several nurses and doctors. Dr. Ma used lecithin to quit smoking in 151 people, divided into four groups. At that time, his method was to give patients substitutes (opium pills) on the one hand, and lecithin pills on the other hand. The amount of lecithin was only one-third or one-quarter of the amount used today. The results were surprisingly good. Among them was an 85-year-old man who was addicted to opium due to abdominal pain and had been smoking for 41 years. He only ate substitutes for 14 days, was hospitalized for 21 days, and was discharged after quitting. Dr. Ma had a detailed article on this report published in the English version of the Chinese Medical Journal, Volume 46, 1932, titled The Effect of Lecithin on Opium Addicts (Report of the Work Done in the Anti-opium Hospital of the National Opium Suppression Commission in Nanking)</p>
<p>The translation means "The Effect of Lecithin on Opium Addiction (Work Report of the Anti-opium Hospital of the National Opium Prohibition Commission in Nanjing)" (To be continued)</p>
<h3>A Brief History of Oral Hygiene in Schools in Various Countries (II)</h3>
<p>— Situ Xue</p>
<p>The so-called experimental class is to select 40 students with the worst oral condition from the fourth to eighth grades of the school to carry out complete dental treatment. At the same time, an agreement is made with each family that the students must strictly observe oral hygiene. This experimental class started on May 18, 1910 and ended in May of the following year. During this period, according to certain rules, efforts were made to treat the students' teeth and improve their daily lives. They were also subjected to six psychological tests by specialists to investigate the actual progress of the students. Initially, Ebensol's prediction was that it would increase by no more than 50%. However, the final experimental result exceeded expectations and increased by 99.8%. Therefore, after the experimental class, the popularization movement of school dentistry quickly unfolded and spread throughout the United States. This led to the motivation to establish the National Mouth Hygiene Association, which was established in July 1911.</p>
<p>The earliest municipal school dental clinic in the United States was founded in Philadelphia. The city established it with city funds in 1910. The staff of the clinic was composed of 210 practicing dentists in the city who participated in the volunteer service. This group of dedicated people was called The Philadelphia Dental Dispensary Corps.</p>
<p>In 1913, New York State began to set up a State Mouth Hygiene Inspector. After that, about seven or eight states, including Massachusetts, also set up inspectors, specializing in supervising oral hygiene services within the state and guiding oral hygiene knowledge to primary school teachers.</p>
<p>Oral hygiene assistants are assistants to dentists who specialize in assisting in all matters related to children's oral hygiene. They are indispensable for preventive work in school dental treatment. These talents are trained by oral hygiene assistant schools. This kind of school was founded in the fall of 1913. Mr. Forsyth began to found it in BridgePort. After about two years, the states of Massachusetts and Conneoticut also promulgated and allowed the adoption of regulations by state law. Subsequently, more than 30 states, including New York, Pennsylvania, and California, also stipulated and promulgated special permission. Its educational institutions are mostly located in universities or hospitals to cultivate this kind of talent.</p>
<p>The American Dental Association has a facility for oral hygiene education (1924) and works with dental medical societies in various states to carry out large-scale activities. Miss E Schmidt, who graduated from oral hygiene assistant, is the director and is a talented woman in this field.</p>
<p>The past school oral hygiene movement in the United States has been described above. In the past ten years, the greatest contribution has been made by Mr. Forsyth of BridgePort. Not only is his achievement in founding oral hygiene assistants known at the time, but since he became the dental director of the city in 1914, he has created a more rational school dentistry and published his achievements. The entire American oral hygiene community admires his enthusiasm.</p>
<h3>Common Knowledge Q&amp;A on Diseases</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(56) Rickets (Above)</p>
<p>(Question) What is Rickets?</p>
<p>(Answer) It is a disease of impaired bone development in children.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the Western name for rickets?</p>
<p>(Answer) The Western name is Rachitis, also known as English disease, because it was first recorded by English physician Glisson in 1650.</p>
<p>(Question) During what age period are children most likely to suffer from rickets?</p>
<p>(Answer) Most often in the second half of the first year, it is easiest to suffer from this disease; however, the severe symptoms only appear at the age of two.</p>
<p>(Question) How does rickets start?</p>
<p>(Answer) The main reason is malnutrition. Therefore</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>children who are artificially nourished suffer from it a lot. Recently, it has been learned that the lack of Vitamin D is greatly related to this disease. Therefore, rickets is considered a type of Vitamin D deficiency disease.</p>
<p>(Question) Is the occurrence of rickets related to daily life?</p>
<p>(Answer) Yes, any inappropriate lifestyle, lack of air and sunlight, can be an inducing factor for the occurrence of rickets.</p>
<p>(Question) Is there a geographical relationship to the occurrence of rickets?</p>
<p>(Answer) The most cases of this disease occur in England; northern Germany and Italy also have many.</p>
<p>(Question) Is it related to heredity?</p>
<p>(Answer) It is also related. Sometimes many people in one family suffer from rickets.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the precursors when rickets first starts?</p>
<p>(Answer) When the disease first starts, there are often unique precursory symptoms. These are loss of appetite, diarrhea, bronchitis, excessive sweating, restlessness at night, crying, etc.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the later symptoms like?</p>
<p>(Answer) The unique symptoms of rickets are changes in bones, muscles, and joints.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the bone symptoms like?</p>
<p>(Answer) The symptoms that appear in the bones of the head are: softening of the occipital bone, which is thin like paper in severe cases. Head shape changes, forehead and top protrude, becoming square. In the chest, the cartilage boundary of the ribs bulges and can be seen through the skin. The sternum protrudes forward, forming a pigeon breast. The spine is laterally curved or kyphotic. The pelvis is narrow. The ends of the limb bones are thickened and highly curved. When the legs are side by side, they bend inward or outward, forming an X-shape or O-shape. The ankle joints also become curved. The clavicle and forearm bones are often easily fractured incompletely if they suffer a slight external injury.</p>
<h3>The Medical Science of Pain Relief (10)</h3>
<p>— Li Xing</p>
<p>Gas Pain: Gas pain is something that few people have. Frequent gas pain is also very annoying. Although gas pain cannot kill people, it makes them very uncomfortable. The most common cause of gas pain is constipation. People who have a bowel movement every day rarely have gas pain. Some people only have a bowel movement once every ten days or two weeks, so it is not surprising to have gas pain. Secondly, cirrhosis of the liver and chronic inflammation of the large intestine are also causes of gas pain. Smoking opium and injecting morphine can cause gas pain by stopping intestinal peristalsis.</p>
<p>The method of relieving gas pain is very simple. Just pay attention to avoiding constipation. Quitting opium and morphine is also a fundamental solution. Secondly, hot, moist compresses on the abdomen and enemas are also of considerable value. Reduce the intake of foods that are difficult to digest.</p>
<p>Luetic Crises: Late-stage syphilis, or tertiary syphilis, often causes a violent pain known as "luetic crises" fifteen or twenty years after the initial infection. The cause of the pain is the destruction of the posterior spinal cord and posterior spinal cord glands by syphilis bacteria. In this way, what people call abdominal pain, leg pain, etc., is actually not pain in the abdomen or legs, but is due to the reaction of the spinal cord. The most common pain starts in the legs, starting lightly, but gradually becoming heavier, and finally reaching its peak. Patients often describe this pain as similar to burning, biting, or stabbing with a knife. This pain is like a red-hot sharp knife piercing into the flesh and twisting it back and forth. This pain strikes suddenly like lightning and lasts for several hours. After a short period of calm, the pain returns. Sometimes this pain comes and goes, lasting for many years. There is also a type of pain called "girdle pain," which is pain around the waist or chest. Along with the pain, there are often various abnormal sensations, such as numbness, soreness, abnormal cold sensations, abnormal hot sensations, tingling, etc. When the pain is extremely severe, pressing on the painful area may relieve the pain, or it may make the pain worse.</p>
<p>Visceral crises are similar to the above crises, but the pain is felt in the abdomen. When the pain comes, it suddenly strikes like a stabbing knife, and vomiting follows. After the pain goes away, the patient is like a normal person. The pain comes and goes like this, lasting for varying lengths of time.</p>
<p>Treating this pain with narcotics to temporarily relieve the pain can be considered an emergency measure, for example, by a doctor injecting morphine? The fundamental solution is still to use methods to treat syphilis. If you had syphilis ten or twenty years ago and encounter similar pain, you must consider that it may be a disaster left over from syphilis.</p>
<p>Ectopic Abortion: Ectopic abortion is a dangerous condition for women. The meaning of ectopic abortion is that the abortion does not occur in the proper location. Normally, an abortion occurs in the uterus. Ectopic abortion often occurs in the fallopian tubes (the fallopian tubes connect from the two corners of the uterus into the lower abdomen, each tube about the size of a pencil). The function of the fallopian tubes is to transport female eggs to the uterus. The female egg combines with the male sperm to form a fetus. The proper place for pregnancy is in the uterus. But sometimes this rule is not followed, and sperm and eggs meet in the fallopian tube to form a fetus, and the fetus grows in the fallopian tube. Because the fallopian tube is not intended for growing a fetus, the fetus gradually grows to two or three months, and the fallopian tube suddenly ruptures and bleeds, and at the same time, severe pain occurs.</p>
<p>Due to bleeding from this type of abortion, even a strong person will become pale within a few tens of minutes. This special pain and the rapid onset of significant anemia indicate an ectopic abortion.</p>
<p>This is another type of "emergency abdominal disease." Simply relieving the pain is not the right solution. Immediate surgical operation should be performed to remove the ruptured fallopian tube and the fetus, and after stopping the bleeding, perform ordinary surgical pain relief methods.</p>
<p>Menstrual Pain: Menstrual pain is a common ailment for women. There are several causes of menstrual pain, and knowing the cause is essential for an appropriate pain relief method. If you don't know the cause and treat it, you will certainly not get good results. Now let's talk briefly about the causes of menstrual pain: The first cause is nerve pain, that is, nerve pain in the ovaries, uterus, etc., that comes with menstruation. The second cause is inflammation in the lower abdomen. When menstruation comes, the uterus enlarges, so the pain becomes more severe. The third cause is due to blockage of the uterine passage. Blockage, such as from inflammation of the cervix that causes it to shrink, making it difficult for menstrual fluid to flow out, or from swelling of the endometrium, or from improper positioning of the uterus, or from tumors in the cervix. The fourth cause is the endometrium in the uterus, which causes severe pain every time the membrane is discharged during menstruation. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion of Pulmonary Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>Chapter 10: Prognosis of Pulmonary Tuberculosis</p>
<p>The nature of the lesions in the lungs has a great relationship with the prognosis; the distinction between exudative and proliferative types has been mentioned several times before! Good prognoses are seen in apical tuberculosis, sclerotic tuberculosis, and small, scattered lesions that are not very severe. The caseous pneumonia type in exudative tuberculosis is known to be a severe abnormality, and the bronchopneumonia type, if the temperature is very high, is the same, and these all have poor prognoses. In between these two, like enlarged proliferative tuberculosis, is a typical example; its prognosis is neither very poor nor good; but if there are complications, that is an exception.</p>
<p>The size of the lesions has a close relationship with the quality of the prognosis. Generally, the larger the area, the worse the prognosis. If cavities have formed, then the condition is relatively serious, and the prognosis is not good; about six or seven out of ten will inevitably die within about five years. This is a very alarming record! But early infiltrating cavities are an exception; in addition, whether the patient receives proper treatment or not has a great relationship with the progression of the disease.</p>
<p>Important clinical signs, such as the level of temperature, the presence of tubercle bacilli in the sputum, the condition of blood tests, and the speed of rise and fall of blood cells, all have a very close relationship with the prognosis. In addition, if the patient with this disease also has diabetes, syphilis, or other diseases, or has complications such as meningitis, laryngeal tuberculosis, or intestinal tuberculosis, the prognosis is mostly poor.</p>
<p>Even if the disease in a patient with this disease is changing and has been in a static state for several months or years; even if they occasionally suffer from influenza or pharyngitis, or due to excessive labor, it is enough to make it re-erupt one day and become progressive. As for other acute infectious diseases, that can certainly be inferred from this. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Common Sense on Ear, Nose, Throat, and Eye Hygiene</h3>
<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(43) Ear Discharge</p>
<p>Ear discharge is a disease commonly known as a running ear. In medical terms, any secretion from the middle ear that is serous, mucous, purulent, or bloody can be called ear discharge. Many children suffer from this disease. The main reason why parents take their children to see an ear doctor is that the children have ear discharge. Because children are particularly likely to get ear discharge. For example, during measles, scarlet fever, colds, bronchitis, pneumonia, etc., otitis media can often be caused. The changes of otitis media can often lead to ear discharge. We must not neglect this result. Because ear discharge can cause deafness in mild cases and can be fatal in severe cases. The reason why it is fatal is that it is caused by meningitis or brain abscesses secondary to ear discharge. These types of meningitis and brain abscesses are specifically called otogenic meningitis and otogenic brain abscesses in medicine. The symptoms they produce are completely similar to ordinary meningitis and brain abscesses. The only difference is that they are induced by the pathogens of ear discharge. But when it comes to the word danger, they are the same. Unfortunately, the general public does not pay attention to ear discharge. They think that ear discharge is not important and often let it run its course. Or they put in things like golden thread lotus leaves, scallions, garlic, and other plants. Or they blow in powders such as borneol. These treatments can all cause severe suppuration and are harmful rather than beneficial. Sometimes, they even treat it as a kind of dampness in the ear and deliberately do not treat it, thinking that treatment can induce internal diseases. Sometimes, parents think that the cause of ear discharge is that tears accidentally get into the ear when the child cries. This kind of misunderstanding should no longer exist in this era of prosperous medicine and promotion of hygiene. There are also many patients who ask me verbally or in writing, "Can ear deafness caused by ear discharge be treated before the ear discharge is cured?" This question is very simple and easy to answer. That is, first, treat the ear discharge. Once the ear discharge is cured, then treat the ear deafness, which will be effective. Otherwise, if you don't seek the root cause, it will be difficult to see results.</p>

<p>Economic Supplement</p>
<h3>The Way Out for Japan's Foreign Trade</h3>
<p>— Wang Yutong</p>
<p>Japan's Economic Relations with the North</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, the relationship between China and Japan, from a historical perspective, can be described as extremely bad. Recently, there has been a widespread rumor in Japan about Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, with loud voices and increasing intensity. The recent conference of Japanese consuls stationed in China held in Shanghai has also closed, and the Japanese envoy has returned home to report soon. The content of the discussions is unknown, but the so-called "economic cooperation" must be the main item on the agenda.</p>
<p>To speak of economic cooperation, it is necessary that both countries have a balanced economic development, without unilateral coercion, and deeply feel the necessity of practical cooperation and mutual assistance, so that economic reciprocity can be discussed, and the substance of cooperation can be achieved. However, in recent years, our country has been plagued by disasters, rural areas have gone bankrupt, and cities have suffered from industrial and commercial decline. The economy is so bad that we are busy trying to remedy ourselves. We have no time to be surprised and seek help elsewhere, let alone plan for others. Moreover, according to our country's past foreign economic relations, we only know that the relationship of invasion and being invaded exists. Suddenly, there is talk of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, like a voice in an empty valley. Does our good neighbor really want to show us great love? We have to study this carefully.</p>
<p>The survival of Japan's entire economy is entirely built on the export trade business. Since the establishment of the puppet organization after the September 18th Incident, Japan was fully confident that the Northeast market would become a monopolized market for Japanese goods in the future: we will never allow others to sleep soundly beside our bed. However, things in the world are unpredictable. Since the Northeast was forcibly occupied by Japan, the economic situation has been declining day by day. Soybeans, which were known for their special products, have suffered from the impact of the world economic panic, which has reduced soybean consumption and sharply reduced exports. The export of soybean oil is mostly to Europe, with Germany accounting for about 70% of the total exports. Soybean cake is mostly exported to Japan, but recently, the decline of the German oil industry and the decline of Japanese agriculture have hindered its exports. Looking at the overall trade in the Northeast, since 1933, it has changed from a surplus position to a deficit position. The so-called "Manchurian boom" by the Japanese is actually a boom transferred from Japan. Since the establishment of the puppet organization, Japanese capital has flowed in in large quantities and engaged in investment activities in various businesses, and the Northeast economic community has temporarily presented an unusually active atmosphere. However, after all, the Northeast market itself has weak digestion capacity. Although a large number of Japanese goods are sold at low prices, they still cannot fill the desires of Japanese entrepreneurs. Therefore, at present, Japanese goods in the Northeast market have no other way out except to wait for the recovery of the Northeast's special product trade. This is what the Japanese economic community calls "doing everything possible and waiting for the destiny of heaven."</p>
<p>Japanese Goods and the World Market</p>
<p>Furthermore, looking at the relationship between the world market and Japanese goods, since 1933, the significant decline in world trade has been slightly alleviated. According to the League of Nations, the total value of world exports in this year was US$107.89 billion. However, compared with 1929, this number is still less than 35% in terms of export value, and only 75% in terms of quantity. In fact, world trade still shows a state of depression.</p>
<p>In this bleak environment, Japan's foreign trade has been extremely active, far exceeding that of other countries. The quantity of Japanese exports in 1933 increased sharply to 144.8% compared with 1928, which suddenly made Japanese goods have a momentum to sweep the world market, and all countries were uneasy about it. The biggest driving force for the increase in Japanese commodity exports is the low exchange rate and the slight cost. The slight cost is due to the low real wages, but most of it is due to the recent development of Japanese industry and the increase in production efficiency. The low exchange rate is extremely beneficial to trade, especially for countries maintaining the gold standard such as the Netherlands, France, and Italy, and their colonies, which are more than enough to be areas for Japanese goods to be dumped abroad. However, according to ordinary economic principles, the low exchange rate is enough to induce the price of commodities to rise, which will affect the domestic products, wages, salaries, land rents, and other prices. As a result, what is gained from this will be lost from that. However, judging from the current situation in Japan, the benefits of the low exchange rate will never be eliminated by other factors. Why? Because the cost of other goods in Japan, except for a small portion of raw materials that are imported, has not increased. For example, Japan's rural areas are currently in a period of decline, and the prices of agricultural products cannot be expensive. There are many unemployed, and general wages and salaries cannot be increased. One more point to note is that the low exchange rate has a great effect on the trade balance in Japan.</p>
<p>From the above points, we can see that there is a good reason why Japanese goods can lead the world market. Looking at its actual achievements, the exports of Japanese goods to British colonies such as India, Australia, the Straits Settlements, East Africa, and New Zealand were 287.8 million yen in 1931, and jumped to 484.3 million yen in 1933. Other places such as the Dutch East Indies, Central America, and South America have all become markets for Japanese goods to be sold. However, since the failure of the London World Economic Conference in 1933, countries have competed to adopt protectionist trade policies in order to ensure the domestic market for their own producers. They have focused on using tariff protection methods, supplemented by restrictions on imports and the absolute method of prohibiting exports, in order to resist external economic forces. Economic isolationism has become more and more profound since then. As a result, economic policies such as the so-called tariff war, trade management, and exchange management have all emerged one after another. The rampant, intrusive Japanese goods have had to bear the brunt and have been strongly resisted everywhere. It is true that for the sake of protecting their own industries, countries cannot compete with low wages, low exchange rates, and low-cost Japanese goods in the market, so they have to resort to the method of squeezing them out. For example, countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, France, Italy, and Switzerland have either raised tariffs, implemented import quota systems, or managed exchanges and collected anti-dumping duties on Japanese goods, which have made Japanese goods suffer the pain of being besieged on all sides in the world market. Therefore, it is necessary to seek another way out urgently.</p>
<p>The Way Out for Japanese Goods</p>
<p>Since the situation of Japanese goods in the international market has changed, the Chinese market has become a good way out for its transfer target. When I traveled to various parts of Japan last summer, the economic community in that country unanimously issued the call for the so-called "re-recognition of the value of the Chinese market," and the government and the public echoed it. Last March, Japan's Japan-China Business Association and other major trade organizations with China spared no effort in advocating the movement for Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. In recent years, Japan's actions in North China have been seen in facts, such as opening up traffic, opening up postal services, and setting up customs. Those that have been publicized and are being planned include opening up shipping routes, joint transportation of goods, building a railway between Jehol and Beiping, opening up Beiping as a commercial port, and building a port in Tanggu, all of which are completed by the Kwantung Army. It wants to wait for the fundamental solution of political and economic fulfillment, so that the gateway of China will be completely blocked by it, and the market of China will be completely monopolized by it. If the current so-called Sino-Japanese economic cooperation movement is realized, Japan will rebuild its economic power in the Yangtze River basin, so that the north and south will be connected and echoed. From then on, not only will the inherent economic vitality of China itself be completely eliminated, but also the economic power of the righteous among the various empires in China will be driven out thousands of miles away.</p>
<h3>Analysis of Japanese Investment in China</h3>
<p>— Tan Bingwen</p>
<p>As calls for Sino-Japanese cooperation grow louder, the major powers cannot help but feel envious, especially Britain and the United States. This is because they respectively hold the leading positions in investment and trade relations. At this crucial juncture, some action must be taken, which explains the recently brewing joint Anglo-American loan and the simultaneous emergence of the Sino-Japanese cooperation theory. The impetuous Sir Sassoon even prematurely revealed the technical details of the proposed loan, rashly publicizing his grand scheme. However, attempting to divulge secrets of heaven is ill-advised, and he ended up being rebuffed, forced to admit his imprudence. Nevertheless, the competition for influence is ongoing, and who will ultimately prevail remains to be seen. However, I will conduct a review of the investment relations between various countries and China, with a particular focus on Japanese investment in China.</p>
<p>To study future lending to China by various countries, it is necessary to trace back to the old loan consortium of 1910. After the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, the competition among countries for loans to China was intense. Consequently, Britain, France, Germany, and the United States formed a banking syndicate, establishing a six million pound loan for the Hukuang Railways. The following year, the "Four-Power Banking Consortium" planned to establish a major loan of ten million pounds for reforming the currency system and revitalizing industries, but it was opposed by Japan and Russia and was thus shelved. Yuan Shikai understood the psychology of the major powers at that time and, in 1912, conducted negotiations for a post-revolution consolidation loan, inviting Japan and Russia to participate and jointly form a "Six-Power Banking Consortium." The proud Uncle Sam, realizing this was unacceptable, resolutely withdrew, leading to another failure. It wasn't until the outbreak of the European War that countries were preoccupied with their own affairs, and Japan and the United States seized the opportunity to monopolize the Chinese investment market in the name of various industrial loans. Most noteworthy was the successful Nishihara Loans during the Terauchi Cabinet period in Japan (1916-1918), amounting to a massive 120 million Japanese yen. After the war, the United States advocated the formation of a new Anglo-American-French-Japanese banking consortium, intending to break the Japanese monopoly, making this new consortium the sole creditor of China and granting it the authority to oversee all existing and negotiated loans (whether political or industrial). Unfortunately, this seems to have become obsolete. After the Nine-Power Treaty of 1922, individual loans became impossible. Therefore, although there was the US Cotton and Wheat Loan of 1933, it was an exception because it was purely economic in nature, but it is said that considerable effort was expended in prior coordination and lobbying!</p>
<p>Looking at the current amount of Chinese government debt, the total foreign debt is approximately US$586 million, of which Japan accounts for 38.2%, Britain ranks second with 36.1%, France accounts for 16.6%, the United States only 7.1%, and Germany 7.1%. If we talk about the total amount of investment, the situation is slightly different: Britain has US$1,189 million, Japan US$586 million, and the United States US$106 million (the above percentages are based on records on page 710 of Volume 16, No. 12 of the Japan International Economic Weekly). Although the United States does not occupy a particularly important position in investment, it stands in the leading position in trade, and its influence cannot be underestimated. With Britain and the United States holding special positions, they naturally do not want China to "cooperate" with Japan alone. If there are benefits, they also want a piece of the action!</p>
<p>We must not forget that this article focuses on a review of Japanese investment in China. The history of Japanese investment in China is very short. At the beginning of the 20th century, it only accounted for 0.1% of China's total debt (according to the above-mentioned publication). Later, the Boxer Rebellion occurred, and Japan also received a share of the Boxer Indemnity. Gradually, opportunities arose. In 1908, the Hanyeping Company was worried about a lack of funds, so the Yokohama Specie Bank used its massive deposits to invest in the company. In 1909, the South Manchurian Railway loan was also successfully completed. Since then, Japanese investment in China has made remarkable progress. Before the war, Japanese investment in China could be said to be centered on the three northeastern provinces. After the war, territorial expansion gradually entered "China proper." In this accelerated development process, Japanese investment even occupied the leading position. By the eve of the Mukden Incident (end of 1930), Japanese investment in China proper was on par with investment in the three northeastern provinces. According to Rener's Foreign Investment in China, the amount of Japanese investment in "Manchuria" at that time was 1.1 billion yen, while outside "Manchuria" it was 1.173 billion yen, truly surpassing the former. Now, "Manchuria" has in fact become a Japanese dependency, allowing it to be exploited at will, and its economic monopoly is certainly in its hands. Even in provinces outside "Manchuria," Japan's economic influence is growing both openly and secretly, especially in North China and the Yangtze River Basin. I wonder what our compatriots, unaccustomed to planning for the future, think? The following is a survey by the Japanese News Alliance, showing the latest figures for Japanese investment in China (excluding the three northeastern provinces): (unit: 1,000 Japanese yen)</p>
<p>(A) Direct Business Investment</p>
<p>Transportation Industry 20,125 Banking and Finance Industry 65,046</p>
<p>Mining Industry 9,7 Import and Export Trade 248,169</p>
<p>Other 72,105 Manufacturing Industry 232,697</p>
<p>Total 647,859</p>
<p>(B) Loans to Chinese Companies and Organizations</p>
<p>Hanyeping 40,000 Nansun Railway 10,73 Textile Industry 7,988 Local Public Welfare 18,700 Total 77,427</p>
<p>(C) Loans to the Chinese Government</p>
<p>Secured Loans 45,469 Unsecured Loans 200,087</p>
<p>Railway Debt 167,164 Transportation Debt (excluding railways) 35,433 Total 448,155 Total 1,173,441</p>
<p>Direct investment refers to the establishment of industrial and commercial enterprises in China using Japanese capital. From the above, we can see that the amount of direct investment accounts for more than half of the total debt. This is due to the existence of consular jurisdiction, which allows foreign merchants to conveniently set up factories locally without having to pay business taxes, resulting in considerable annual profits. Using our raw materials, exploiting our labor, and then processing them into goods to exchange for our money, what an ingenious method! Japan is only separated from us by a narrow strip of water, and they know our culture and geography like the back of their hand, so Japanese businesses are particularly developed. Recently, the Guangdong government planned to levy business taxes on foreign merchants, and the audacious foreign merchants dared to refuse, and they are still entangled in unclear disputes! So much capital has been invested by Japan in directly operating industry and commerce, and other countries are certainly unwilling to be outdone. Under the competition of foreign businesses, each with special rights, where is there any hope for the development of our nascent industry? If we do not think of ways to remedy this situation of foreign businesses dominating the market, I don't know to what extent they will become even more arrogant!</p>
<p>Secondly, it is worth noting the outlook for Japanese investment in China's transportation sector. According to the above table, the amount of railway debt and other transportation debt reaches more than 200 million yuan. As the Russian Vladimir Ulyanov said, "The transportation system is to a country as the blood vessels are to the human body." His followers have desperately developed transportation in the two five-year plans. With smooth blood flow, a strong body can be expected. Looking back at our country, although the transportation industry is nominally owned by our people, in fact there is another "boss" behind it. There is too much debt, and the ability to repay it is inevitably weak. Moreover, many of the debts incurred are unclear, and even if there is the ability to repay them, there is no way to start. According to Japanese statistics, there are even many cases where the interest exceeds the principal. A list is shown on the left:</p>

<p>The above loan amounts were surveyed by Japan in April of Showa 9 (1934), and are generally still the same today. Those that have been recently consolidated include the Ping Sui Railway Loan, the Wired Telegraph Loan of East Asia Development, the Ping Sui Railway Material Loan of Mitsui &amp; Co., the Telephone Loan and Telephone Material Loan of China-Japan Industry, and the Shandong Province Industrial Loan. Now, the elusive Anglo-American loan, if it becomes a reality, will naturally be something Japan does not want; but if Japan handles it alone, it may also be unable to do so. In the midst of this, our country, which is being dominated, should also have a deep feeling that there is no other way but to struggle hard.</p>
<h3>Discussion on the Collapse of the Shantou Currency System</h3>
<p>— Deng Bangjie</p>
<p>(Continued from Issue 118)</p>
<p>(4) Evaluation</p>
<p>(1) Evaluation of the Currency Inflation Faction. It is true that ordinary stores can engage in large transactions with small capital because of the agility of capital turnover. Now, suppose there is a merchant, A, with a capital of 100,000 yuan and monthly transactions of 80,000 yuan. Assuming that goods are purchased every half month, the annual capital turnover can be 24 times, with a total transaction volume of 1.92 million yuan. If goods are purchased once a month, the annual capital turnover is 12 times, with a total transaction volume of 960,000 yuan. With a capital of 100,000 yuan, the transaction volume can reach 960,000 to 1.92 million yuan, which is equivalent to an increase of 8.6 to 18.11 times in capital. The same is true of the financial market. If currency circulation is agile, transferring funds from one place to another, the chips can also be increased significantly. Unless it is truly a last resort, why should there be a feeling of inadequacy?</p>
<p>The currency shortage in Shantou is indeed an undeniable fact. However, upon closer examination, the degree of the shortage is not as severe as generally perceived. The general feeling of currency shortage stems from two aspects:</p>
<p>(1) Because industry and commerce do not yet have the habit of using commercial bills, and the financial market lacks flexible credit instruments to assist in allocation, funds are trapped in stagnation. It is difficult to adjust surpluses and shortages. Those with surplus funds suffer from the inability to use them, while those with shortages feel the strain of currency scarcity.</p>
<p>(2) As a result of the financial panic in recent years, depositors generally regard deposits in silver shops as a dangerous path, and cash is hoarded and not released. On the silver industry side, lending is also becoming increasingly cautious. They dare not rashly lend money to lower- and middle-level merchants with slightly weaker credit for relief. On the other hand, upper-level merchants with good credit do not need loans from the silver industry. The silver industry has no way to use its funds, and the accumulation is increasing. The lower- and middle-level merchants are calling for help, but there is no way to obtain loans, and they feel the strain of currency scarcity. The evident tightening of daily interest rates in recent years is a strong proof of these facts.</p>
<p>In summary, the origin of the feeling of currency shortage is very clear, and the illusion of a temporary currency shortage is also very obvious. In the current situation, the way to provide relief is to focus on circulating funds as an urgent task. If increasing the money supply is still seen as the only solution, it will not only be like scratching an itch through boots, failing to hit the spot, but even if there is a slight effect, it will only be treating the symptom, not the cause, and will not be sufficient to speak of real effectiveness. In the past, when the Han Dynasty rose, it inherited the ills of the Qin Dynasty and allowed the people to mint coins. As coins increased, the people became more impoverished. The problem lay in increasing the currency supply without considering circulating the currency. Those who advocate currency inflation can learn from this!</p>
<p>Moreover, currency inflation not only does not help, but also harms finance. Because the amount of currency increases and the value of the currency falls, it will lead to the complete loss of paper currency credit, accelerating the collapse of the entire financial market. Even if it is harmless, because it cannot prevent financial panic (as evidenced by the facts in recent years), panic will inevitably continue to occur after the implementation of a currency inflation policy. Will the currency inflation policy continue to be implemented indefinitely? I am afraid that the public's trust in the silver industry will gradually diminish and eventually there will be a day when it cannot be implemented. At that time, the flood of currency will overwhelm all industries, and the damage will be indescribable. Even from the perspective of overall social welfare, currency inflation will inevitably lead to rising prices, and those who rely on small wages for a living will suffer from freezing and starvation. The asset class will be able to enjoy unjustified profits due to the increase in land prices and rents. Last year, between May and June, after the news of the issuance of limited-term commercial warehouse certificates was released, Shantou land prices actually rose by 20-30%. It is difficult to avoid that some people raised land prices in the hope of mortgaging more commercial warehouse certificates, but there is no doubt that it was affected by currency inflation. It can be seen that real estate developers want to issue circulating notes entirely for their own private gain, which will only deepen the suffering of the masses. What could be worse than this?</p>
<p>(2) Criticism of the General Exchange Policy and the Currency Contraction Policy. All countries' banking laws require that the issuance of banknotes must first be authorized by the government, whether it adopts a single issuance system or a multiple issuance system. However, the issuance system in Shantou is different. The issuance of guaranteed banknotes, blank notes, auxiliary notes, circulating notes, and guarantee certificates has never been authorized by the government, and the guarantee of the city's commercial association is sufficient. Even if there is excessive issuance, the public dares not investigate, and the authorities have no way to investigate. Furthermore, according to our country's banking law, banks must have 60% cash reserves and 40% guarantee reserves when issuing banknotes, and no real estate (such as land) can be used as reserves (Shanghai real estate developers are currently requesting to use real estate deeds as 10% of the guarantee reserves, but it has not yet been approved). According to the intention of the legislation, the price of real estate fluctuates frequently, and the ups and downs are often drastically different. When a major risk comes, it is difficult to convert real estate into cash, so it is not suitable for use as banknote reserves. However, the guaranteed banknotes in Shantou are entirely backed by real estate, which is like being based on the mouth of a volcano, with the danger of destruction at any time. When the market is prosperous, land prices tend to rise, and the value of banknotes can be maintained. However, once a recession hits, land prices will immediately fall, and the value of banknotes will inevitably fall accordingly. The huge tide of refusal to accept and runs on banks will continue to emerge, and the financial market will have no peaceful days. For example, the land price of a certain hotel on Waima Road in Shantou was 300 yuan per well when it was purchased in the past, but now it has depreciated to 30-40 yuan, and no one cares about it. If such real estate is used as reserves, I am afraid that the amount of conversion will only reach 30-40% of the issuance amount! Even if the price of real estate remains unchanged, its valuation, as proven by past facts, has never been fair. There are many abuses in underestimating the value of assets, and it is said that assets of lower value are privately drawn after the valuation. The inside story is heavily veiled, and it is even more difficult to investigate. In the past, the use of real estate as collateral was originally said to be able to transform stagnant funds into active capital, and both owners and the market would benefit. Who would have thought that the abuses would reach this point? Is it any wonder that the credit of guaranteed banknotes has been lost? Today, even if any policies are implemented to maintain credit, if the root cause of the credit loss is not removed first, it will only be seen that the effort is in vain, and even if there is a slight effect, it will only be a temporary phenomenon, which I do not approve of.</p>
<p>In my opinion, fundamentally rescuing Shantou's finances now can be summarized in two points:</p>
<p>(1) To seek a currency that is not lacking, we must first seek the smooth operation of the currency; and to seek the smooth operation of the currency, in addition to the silver industry lending as much as possible to lower- and middle-level merchants to avoid currency stagnation, we must also promote the use of commercial bills; and to promote the use of commercial bills, we must establish a credit system! The foundation of a new financial market. This requires the efforts of the silver industry itself.</p>
<p>(2) To avoid the huge tide of refusing to accept guaranteed banknotes and runs on banks, we must first seek to maintain the credit of guaranteed banknotes; and to seek to maintain the credit of guaranteed banknotes, we must start by abolishing the old issuance system, especially the real estate guarantee system, which should be completely abolished. In the future, when the silver industry issues banknotes, it must first obtain the government's permission, and must prepare sufficient cash reserves of 60% and guarantee reserves of 30%. Real estate reserves can only account for a maximum of 20%. This requires government supervision.</p>
<p>If this can be done, Shantou's finances may have a chance of stability.</p>
<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Finance: Call Loan Rate Same as Yesterday at Six Points</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, a bank holiday, so the market atmosphere was even more quiet. Most transactions were suspended. The call loan rate in the market was still six points in the morning and afternoon, the same as the previous day. In the early market, transfer transactions of bills of exchange were over 3.8 million, and new transactions were over 200,000. In the afternoon market, transactions were over 400,000. Transactions in the Small General Association were over 60,000. Silver shops received and remitted over 18 million in foreign public bills. Remittances from various routes were over 200,000. Over 200,000 in banknotes were recovered. There were no redemptions. Although there were slight differences in the auxiliary currency market, the amounts were extremely small. In the morning and afternoon markets, Jiangnan small silver coins were both at 835 yuan and 7 jiao, slightly smaller than the previous day by 8 jiao. Only 2,000 jiao were transacted in the early market, and there was no news in the afternoon market. Guangdong small silver coins were 735 yuan and 3 jiao in the early market, and changed to 735 yuan and 4 jiao in the afternoon market, resulting in a slight improvement of 4 jiao compared to the previous day. Transactions amounted to 120,000 jiao in the early market and 25,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins were at 336,500 wen, slightly longer than the previous day by 500 wen. The transaction amount was 28,602 strings and 500 wen, equivalent to 8,500 yuan in currency.</p>

<h3>Securities: Last Week, Only the 96 Bonds Showed Significant Fluctuations</h3>
<p>Over the past week (April 8th to 13th), although the Chinese Merchants' Securities Exchange was closed for four days, the market remained very stable, essentially moving sideways. Trading was also quiet. This was because environmental factors such as the British pound loan were still uncertain, Sino-Japanese economic cooperation was merely in the preparatory stages, and the financial accommodations from the three major banks had not yet materialized. The short-term loan due at the end of April was rapidly approaching, and although fellow traders promised to provide some leeway, actual infighting was still inevitable, though perhaps slightly mitigated. The US silver purchase policy remained unchanged, and in fact intensified. Silver prices rose again, setting new records. China's somewhat improving financial market was once again hit hard. Exporting silver became even more profitable, inevitably leading to a substantial outflow of capital. After a long period of gestation, any slight change in the environment was bound to cause significant fluctuations in market prices. With the settlement of public bonds approaching, this could potentially trigger infighting. Over the past week, most bonds saw very little movement, fluctuating daily within a range of only a few cents. Swap transactions occurred on both the long and short sides, but in small quantities. Major players rarely entered the market, with most participants adopting a wait-and-see approach. Only the 96 bonds experienced significant fluctuations due to previous rumors of a reorganization, causing a brief surge. However, the underlying mechanics remained unchanged from past manipulations. On Monday, prices were driven up by seventy or eighty cents, and on Tuesday morning, they surged by over a dollar. Following this, major players sold off their holdings, and the bulls rushed to cash out, causing prices to plummet. The sudden rise and fall proved to be fleeting. As a result, at the end of the week, the 96 bonds had fallen by about twenty cents, and the 23 bonds were down by a few cents. Other bonds, while not showing major fluctuations, were slightly better than the previous week, up by one or two cents, with the 19 Good bonds being the sole exception, up by forty cents. The total transaction volume was 67,645,000 yuan, with an additional 4,000 yuan in spot transactions. A comparative table of price changes is shown below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn: Overseas Cotton Prices Also Report Gains</h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton prices opened higher due to positive news from Liverpool, with gains of six to nine points for all months. Subsequently, prices softened slightly as local and Southern sellers emerged. However, strong cloth trading and active buying pushed prices back up, resulting in a firm close. Spot prices rose by fifteen points, and futures prices gained fifteen to seventeen points. English cotton spot prices rose by four points, and futures by six points. Indian cotton initially weakened due to selling by European exporters, but later rallied due to firm silver prices, speculative buying, and short covering. Flat Guile rose by 1.75 rupees, Oomra gained 2.75 rupees, and Broach rose by 2.25 to 3.25 rupees. The original telegram is below (dated April 13th):</p>

<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for July/August Broach cotton was 235 rupees, up 2.25 rupees from the previous day's close.</p>
<h3>Grains: Rice Market Returns to Stability</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, the supply from various sources was slightly scarce, with only over twenty boats arriving (carrying a total of over 4,000 piculs). Sales were slow and both buyers and sellers were behaving normally. Consequently, the overall market situation has returned to stability. Prices for various grades of thick japonica and thin indica rice remained unchanged. However, market sentiment remains stable, and if the weather continues to be overcast, there is hope for an upward trend. With reduced supply of black rice and slightly improved traffic on the Yunnan route, the market showed signs of improvement.</p>
<p>Standard Type White Japonica 2.60, Songyin Early Rice 10.50, Qingpu Late Rice 10.33</p>

<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, the supply from various river routes was limited to twenty-two or twenty-three boats. Among the various goods in the market, white japonica rice sold slightly better, while the rest were lackluster. The market price of japonica rice remained firm, with medium-grade rice increasing by a few cents. Prices for other goods remained similar to before. However, the demand for Japanese rice was weak, leading to a softening of prices.</p>

<h3>Sugar Market: Shantou Exchange Rate Plummets, Chaoqing Becomes Tighter</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was affected by news of a sharp drop in the Shantou exchange rate. Chaoqing numbers were extremely tight, with sellers unanimously refusing to release their stocks, resulting in no transactions. It was noted that earlier in the previous week, prices had fallen to 1,035 yuan per thousand initially, but then recovered to between 1,050 and 1,060 yuan. Yesterday's telegram showed a further drop to 1,025 yuan, another ten yuan lower than before. The downward pressure is expected to continue, leading to a further increase in Chaoqing's operating costs and tightening of supply. It is highly likely that opening prices in the near future will increase. The association's fixed price for 24 Dutch grade coarse white sugar was 17.80 yuan, with no goods available for re-export. Domestically produced Guangdong coarse white sugar was quoted at 17.75 yuan, but no transactions were made. In the lumberyard, Zhenyu brand No. 1 refined white sugar was 17.10 yuan, No. 2 was 17.00 yuan, No. 3 was 16.85 yuan, and No. 4 was 16.60 yuan, down by ten cents due to sluggish sales.</p>
<h3>Metals: 20 Tons of Pure Antimony Sold</h3>
<p>Yesterday, 20 tons of pure antimony were reportedly sold due to strong demand from the Hongkou district. The price was 820 yuan per ton, reflecting the limited supply in the market.</p>

<h3>On Popular Literature</h3>
<p>— Zhang Xiangshan</p>
<p>Observing from the surface, modern literature seems to be divisible into two major currents: popular literature and pure literature. Today, popular literature, whether in quantity or quality, absolutely overwhelms all pure literature. Especially in the commercial market, it demonstrates remarkable activity.</p>
<p>The distinction between popular literature and pure literature seems difficult to clearly define. Particularly, popular literature emerging in the literary world of Europe and America today differs significantly in quality from popular literature in Japan and China. Due to different economic structures, the nature of popular literature also varies among them. Because of this difference in nature, it becomes even more difficult to explain its distinction from pure literature. Moreover, bourgeois pure literature, having developed to its current stage, has already transformed into shallow, defeatist literature!</p>
<p>In a letter from Leo Tolstoy to Leonid Andreyev, regarding Andreyev's inclination towards popular literature, Tolstoy pointed out several characteristics of popular literature: "First, it fails to adhere to the principle of writing only when compelled by a genuine need, thus losing authenticity and dignity. Second, it merely focuses on shocking the reader, resorting to horror-inducing creativity. Third, it is written hastily, with the purity of expression being equal to zero. Fourth, its purpose is to merely cater to the demands and preferences of the modern reading public. This is the most harmful aspect because it neglects the writer's mission." The above criticisms are, of course, not entirely complete, but they certainly contain some of Tolstoy's insightful observations.</p>
<p>In Tolstoy's time, even Andreyev's works were considered popular literature. However, the popular literature that has developed to the present day has become even more degraded in quality and can be said to be completely dominated by decadent elements.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, popular literature in Europe and America can be said to be a byproduct of the fin de siècle. Popular literature in Japan and China can be said to be the remnants of feudal literature. Examples of the former include works by French writers like Jean Lorrain and English female writers like Marie Corelli, while examples of the latter include Naoki Sanjugo, Kan Kikuchi, and the Mandarin Ducks and Butterflies School in China.</p>
<p>The reason popular literature has been able to occupy an unshakeable position in today's literary world is entirely due to social foundations. In Western popular novels, the most common types are pleasure-seeking works such as romance and adventure novels, as well as fantastical works. Needless to say, the love of sensationalism reflects the licentiousness of modern degenerate figures, as exemplified by the works of Jean Lorrain. As for adventure and fantasy works, they cater to the general human desire to escape the real world and seek enjoyment from a surreal world. The world surrounding humanity today is a synthesis of disaster, suffering, hunger, and mediocrity. To escape this harsh world, people seek solace and momentary thrilling pleasure in unreality. Examples of these popular works include W. H. Hudson's *Green Mansions* and R. J. B. Lapham's *South African Travelogue*.</p>
<p>In Japan, popular literature, also known as mass literature, completely inherits the merchant-class literature of the Edo period (the shogunate era of the Tokugawa shogunate). This type of literature can be said to be a pure feudal relic, with its content often focusing on themes such as chivalrous figures, loyalist patriots, and geishas. This accurately demonstrates the continued existence of a quasi-feudal society in Japan. The subject matter of this literature largely focuses on historical figures, leading people to completely return to the past, and in this way, popular literature maximizes its power to maintain the current political system. Examples include Naoki Sanjugo's *The Tale of the Heike* and *Soma Daisaku*, Jūichiya Yoshizaburō's *Shimpūren*, Eiji Yoshikawa's *Chūshingura*, and Jiro Osaragi's *Mito Kōmon*.</p>
<p>At the same time, there is also a type of popular literature similar to that of Europe and America. These works reflect the late-stage literature of the newly emerged capitalist society after the Meiji Restoration. The content largely focuses on romance and pleasure-seeking, and these writers are mostly defeatist, such as Kan Kikuchi's *Questions of Chastity*, Kyūya Shinjū's *A Chastity*, and Kōryoku Satō's *Silk Mud Shoes*.</p>
<p>I don't want to discuss Chinese popular literature, because I remember that Mr. Mao Dun offered many insightful opinions about feudal popular literature in regards to Zhang Henshui's *Laughable Destinies*.</p>
<p>Having recognized the basis of popular literature in contemporary society, we cannot attribute the flourishing of popular literature entirely to social causes. I believe that popular literature certainly has its own strengths in certain aspects. What are these strengths? They are interesting and complex stories and accessible writing. An American literary historian has pointed out several characteristics of popular literature: first, it is modern, sensory, and abounds with creative energy. Second, it is multifaceted, gradually elevating the conflicts of events to a breaking point. Third, it acknowledges that modern readers dislike verbosity and demand quick resolutions, action, and entertainment. I believe that in terms of entertainment, Western popular literature is similar to Eastern popular literature; this storytelling ability certainly surpasses that of pure literature. Secondly, in terms of writing, it is easy to understand, unlike the abstruseness of pure literature. Let's take an example: Conan Doyle's *Sherlock Holmes* series is much more interesting than Charles Dickens' *A Tale of Two Cities*. The significant difference in sales of the translated versions in China demonstrates this. This is because *Sherlock Holmes* is a popular literary work, and the writing is more accessible.</p>
<p>Recently, the importance of emphasizing the entertainment value of stories was also discussed at the Soviet Writers' Congress. I believe that contemporary literature is lacking in the entertainment value of stories. For example, *Spring Silkworms* and *Laughable Destinies* provide an excellent contrast!</p>
<p>At a time when Chinese popular literature is thriving—as evidenced by the serial novels appearing in newspapers in both the North and South—if we want to reject popular literature, then we must adopt some of its strengths in our literature. We should emphasize interesting, complex, and dynamic stories while eliminating its feudalistic and defeatist ideologies.</p>
<p>Currently, a new kind of popular literature has indeed emerged in the Soviet Union, namely the works of Pyotr Pavlenko, such as *Japanese War at Sea* ( *Tsushima*) and *Death Line*. These works describe the naval battles of the Russo-Japanese War, and the content is very entertaining, such as Russian warships accidentally attacking British merchant ships and the cowardice of sailors and admirals. It can be said that they cater to the tastes of the general public. In this entertaining way, the corruption of the Tsarist regime is exposed without reservation. The value of this kind of popular literature not only leaves no toxicity for readers, but also provides readers with historical lessons, allowing them to understand the evolutionary stages of history. Therefore, in the present situation where contemporary popular literature occupies a great advantage, we must diligently learn from popular literature like Pavlenko's, being multifaceted, entertaining, and containing progressive lessons. In this way, our literature can gain a wide readership, and the feudal, licentious, and adventurous popular literature will gradually die out.</p>
<h3>Ballad of the Righteous Harmony Society (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Han Feng</p>
<p>The Qing officials viewed the lives of the people as if they were theatrical props, as can be seen from this. Therefore, the people at that time were in various states of persecution, on one side were the officials and gentry, and on the other were the Christian converts and foreigners. The growth of the Righteous Harmony Society can be said to be a desperate measure taken by these persecuted people who had no other choice, a way to try to save themselves. We can imagine their cruelty from the two points of the Imperial Righteousness using green gas cannons to attack Tianjin and desperately firing cannons at Beijing City. The author wrote about the situation after the fall of Tianjin City, saying: "The corpses fell to the ground, without any wounds. Even three hours after the city fell, foreign soldiers saw many Chinese standing against the wall, holding guns, glaring, as if they were about to open fire. When they got closer, they realized that they had died from the poisonous gas, only their bodies were leaning against the wall, so they didn't fall to the ground" (Volume 11). What a tragic scene this is! At this time, to avoid their harassment, one only had to put a strip on the door, writing "Great Japan Submissive Citizen," what a miserable state of oppression this is! At this time, the people were truly what is called:</p>
<p>Therefore, the living beings suffered calamity, their families were destroyed and their property was lost. They abandoned their sons and daughters and fled for their lives, living in the open and eating in the wind, not looking like humans. They encountered officials and soldiers who plundered them at will, and if they met bandits, they would be raped. Foreign soldiers harbored hatred and sought revenge, and when they encountered them, their lives were lost. There was no way to go in the thorny land, and they ended their remaining lives in ditches. The corpses were discarded and piled up like mountains, and the blood formed rivers that boats could not travel on. The cruel situation cannot be fully described, only two or three tenths of it are in this book. (Volume 11)</p>
<p>The situation in Tianjin was like this, and so was Beijing: "The soldiers are bandits and the bandits are soldiers, the soldiers and bandits are united and act wildly. The volleys of guns are like a string of pearls, and the sound of crying is unbearable to hear. Wealthy merchants and large businesses were robbed, and everyone, big and small, was uneasy. As soon as the bandits arrived, they opened the boxes to look, searching everywhere for gold and silver. They jumped over walls and rooftops, and the streets and roads were filled with soldiers." (Volume 7) Comparing the two, what kind of pincer attack and persecution were the people under! This kind of tragedy was not only seen by the Chinese, but also recorded by the people in the foreign troops who came to attack China at that time. A series of correspondence written by the French woman Lotti at that time described the heartbreaking and tragic situation of the people being persecuted, which was even worse than this. Of course, many foreigners also sacrificed in this incident. According to the book, all the foreigners in Shanxi Province, regardless of men, women, old or young, were deceived and killed by the governor at the same time. In one bombing in Beijing, more than one hundred and twenty children died. This brutality is equally bestial. The author used a long book to describe the tragic scene of the foreigners being killed in Shanxi. Writing about Yuxian killing foreign women, even "tied her hands and took a sharp knife and stabbed her upwards from her lower body, and she died by piercing her heart and breaking her abdomen." (Volume 13) His mother wanted to save the last foreign child, but was refused.</p>
<p>The book "Romance of the Righteous Harmony Society," due to the complex facts and the author's unwillingness to abandon any aspect, but only to collect as much as possible, generally speaking, has the shortcomings of being disorganized and mixed. In a short book of twenty chapters, it is inherently difficult to write about all the facts of the Righteous Harmony Society, the situation of the court officials, the state of the various provinces in the north and south, the persecution suffered by the Chinese and foreign people, the continuous burning, killing, robbery, and war, conspiracies and tricks. It is a natural result that there are no special achievements. Writing about the infighting and killing of officials is quite successful. Writing about the Righteous Harmony Society only tries its best to expose their brutality, and does not give the protectors a clearer impression of their motives. I think that if this book is viewed as a historical material book, its value is greater than that of a literary book. This book has no publishing house, it is probably printed by a small bookstore, like "Ballad of the Gengzi Incident," and it is very difficult to obtain now. (End)</p>
<h3>Shop Apprentice</h3>
<p>— Chen Fuxi</p>
<p>As long as you mention Shen Fuju Tailor Shop, everyone will know that there is a pitiful shop apprentice in the shop. Shen Fuju is located on a quiet street. The street, shops, people, and stone streets all have the simple and unsophisticated style of the 18th century. The dilapidated shops open up sauce gardens, butcher shops, tofu shops, southern goods, fruits, teahouses, and grocery stores. Shen Fuju shop is embedded in the middle of these shops. Those who know Shen Fuju Tailor Shop know that Shen Fuju's needlework is the best. If you have clothes to make, you are willing to take them to him. However, Shen Fuju's boss is also notoriously fierce and treats his apprentices even more cruelly.</p>
<p>The boss is a thin man. He usually wears a pair of copper-rimmed reading glasses when sewing, and when he looks at people, he always peeks his eyes out of the edges of the glasses. He is old and has many things to do that he doesn't have time for, so he took an apprentice last year. Many light tasks and odd jobs are done by the apprentice. In fact, the boss didn't teach him much needlework, but just treated him as a servant, teaching him to hold the child, sweep the floor, buy vegetables, and wash dishes. He had to do everything and had no free time.</p>
<p>"Ah Fu, you dead ghost! You can't even hold a child!"</p>
<p>If the boss heard the child crying while he was holding it, he would roar and scold him. Ah Fu always tried his best to keep the child from crying every day. When washing dishes and cooking, if he accidentally broke a bowl or burned the rice, the boss would get angry and beat him until he begged for mercy. Ah Fu is young and not thorough in his work. The boss asked him to iron a newly sewn Hua silk gauze jacket to make it stiff, but Ah Fu was careless, and a piece of charcoal fell down and burned the clothes. A big hole was burned right in the front chest, which was a place that could be seen and could not be fixed. Ah Fu panicked and started to cry.</p>
<p>"You dead ghost! Why are you crying?"</p>
<p>"It's…it's…burned…"</p>
<p>The master took the clothes in his hand and looked at the big hole through his reading glasses. A burst of anger suddenly erupted, and he cursed loudly.</p>
<p>"Beast! Are you unconscious!"</p>
<p>Then, a loud slap in the face.</p>
<p>He raised a bamboo ruler and hit him on the head. He beat him from the shop to the corner of the room, and from the corner of the room to the kitchen. There was only crying and cursing in the room. The neighbors were standing in front of the shop door, but they just watched the beating and no one tried to persuade him. The tailor boss had a strange temper: when he was beating someone with anger, if others tried to persuade him, he would blame them instead. So those who knew it all stood by and watched. Every time he beat him, he would beat him until his skin was torn and his flesh was bleeding. When Ah Fu first came to be an apprentice, his face was chubby and white, with a little rosy color, and his demeanor was also very lively: innocent; but now, a fourteen-year-old child, his attitude has completely turned into that of an adult. The innocent mood in Ah Fu's little soul seems to be gradually disappearing in the dawn of the morning light. He is always short, and it has been almost a year and a half since he entered the shop, but he has not grown taller at all; he walks like a little monkey jumping around. The rosy color, like the peach blossom red, that he used to have, can no longer be seen. On his face, besides bones and skin, there is only a layer of dim, haggard shadow. Looking in the mirror often surprises him: he remembers that when he was at home, he was fat and strong, but now he has become like this, as if he has been replaced by someone else, and he doesn't even recognize himself.</p>
<p>"Ah Fu is really suffering! The year he entered the shop…"</p>
<p>The master beat him cruelly, and others said that. Ah Fu heard it many times, and his tears would fall down. But Ah Fu, since entering this Shen Fuju Tailor Shop, has never come out. Year after year, he earns a living under this tyrannical master. The heavy work oppresses this malnourished child. In the cold, lonely winter night, the night is so deep, the wind is blowing outside, and the snow is falling. Only Ah Fu sits alone by the Mobil lamp, with tired eyes, stitching and stitching the new clothes in his hands…</p>
<h3>Mr. Juqing (10) (4)</h3>
<p>— Ke Ling</p>
<p>Quietly, there was not a single person in the school. Mr. Juqing tiptoed inside, he felt like he was stealing something from someone for the first time, he could clearly hear his heartbeat.</p>
<p>It was not easy to get to the notice board, the "notice board" was really crowded with notices.</p>
<p>He frantically looked down from the beginning: the curriculum of the teaching office, the meeting rules of the student union, the notice from the accounting office to pay tuition and book fees, the notice of suspension of classes in memory of the death of the premier, the notice of holiday for Arbor Day, the notice of suspension of classes in memory of the "March 18" tragedy... After searching for a long time, he found an extra-large one at the back——</p>
<p>Respectfully inform all students and parents!</p>
<p>A line of crooked and inverted large characters written in "free style" jumped into his eyes, and his heart beat even more violently, as if it was about to break out of his chest and fall to the ground. He quickly looked down:</p>
<p>"Dear fathers and brothers!</p>
<p>It has been found that there are many private schools in this town, as many as bamboo shoots after rain! These schoolteachers are foolish (Mr. Juqing cast a contemptuous glance at the word "foolish"), completely out of touch with the times! They violate Premier Sun's party-based education! Moreover, they disrupt the school in the town, delay the education of children, which is very hateful! Now our school…</p>
<p>It was an extremely important place, his eyes were wide open, frantically searching the notice, like a gambler looking at his last hand that he was betting everything on, about to decide his fate in an instant. Just at this moment, suddenly there was a "bang" behind him, the door opened, and the children's laughter from the playground poured in. Mr. Juqing panicked and was a little at a loss. Hmm, no, he felt empty, and suddenly walked out.</p>
<p>Before he walked out of the patio, seven or eight students covered in sweat, with red faces and steaming heads, had already turned out from the side and met him face to face.</p>
<p>Mr. Juqing felt that there was no way to escape, so he slowed down and put his hands behind his back, as if he was visiting an exhibition, looking around, and slowly moving his body outside. It would be good to run out of the school gate: he thought. But the student holding a big leather ball in his arms had already noticed him.</p>
<h3>Neighbor</h3>
<p>— Awei</p>
<p>The fog, like a curtain, separates</p>
<p>the distant green mountains.</p>
<p>The fog, like a curtain, separates</p>
<p>the powdered face under the gauze window of the opposite neighbor.</p>
<p>Yesterday, no,</p>
<p>every day is like this:</p>
<p>At dusk, under the gauze window of the opposite neighbor,</p>
<p>there is a powdered face with long hair,</p>
<p>appearing from the window,</p>
<p>staring at me infatuatedly,</p>
<p>smiling, charming,</p>
<p>kissing her little finger,</p>
<p>her eyes sending out the light of youthful desire,</p>
<p>suddenly, pretending to be sad,</p>
<p>wrinkling her brows, lowering her head,</p>
<p>as if indicating that she is an abandoned and pitiful person,</p>
<p>finally, frequently waving to me,</p>
<p>finally, disappearing with a charming smile.</p>
<p>Today, there is a thick fog,</p>
<p>the powdered face,</p>
<p>the affectionate eyes,</p>
<p>the charming smile,</p>
<p>the small mouth,</p>
<p>the tender white hands,…</p>
<p>cannot be seen.</p>
<p>The fog, like a curtain, separates</p>
<p>the distant green mountains, and</p>
<p>separates the powdered face under the gauze window of the opposite neighbor.</p>

<p>Shenbao Local Supplement</p>
<p>Talk</p>
<h3>About Radio Hearses</h3>
<p>— Jiawei</p>
<p>Yesterday I read such a piece of news in the newspaper: "The bands operating in this city not only have bizarre costumes, but also the music they play is also inappropriate; some even play funeral music or foreign national anthems at celebratory banquets. Others have hearses equipped with radios to arbitrarily play songs along the way, which is even more inappropriate; it is hoped that the public will understand the big picture and no longer hire such bands and cars, to show solemnity and improve customs."</p>
<p>Indeed, such facts of "absurdity, ridiculousness and causing laughter at home and abroad," we who live in Shanghai have seen and heard too much——even several times a day; and if it happens that the general wealthy old ladies" hold "grand funerals" for their respected elders, then they must hire a dozen bands to walk for several hours; and even make those main streets that are already "roads are like tigers' mouths, and you can't walk in the middle" so crowded that they will almost become "you can't walk a step"!</p>
<p>However, in this "Oriental New York" with 2.5 million residents, and in this dual social state where we want to promote civilization on the one hand, and maintain the inherent feudal remnants on the other, this kind of "bizarre" and "absurd" phenomenon is not accidental! At the same time, under the conditions of saving manpower and time for inevitable funeral services, it is not surprising that radio sets are installed on these hearses, right? To say a "modern" thing, this is moving towards "scientificization," right?</p>
<p>I remember seeing a painting entitled "Superstition Scientificization" in a certain cartoon magazine——in front of the body of a dead person who has not been put in a coffin, there is a radio playing "Namo Amitabha; great compassion, saving the suffering…" I think this painter has this "foresight."</p>
<p>Radio in China, her use can be so broad, even the inventor Mr. Marconi seems unexpected? As for the ban because of this "absurdity" and "inappropriateness," that is another matter. We can't control it here——but we can also know that under the astonishing figure of hundreds of thousands of gold dollars of monthly wireless radio imports, this kind of radio used in superstition scientificization" will also account for a considerable number, right?</p>
<p>Here, people are reminded of someone who once said this: "Foreigners invent things, and Chinese people enjoy them. Foreigners have become our cattle, horses, and slaves!" We Chinese people seem to be extremely clever (!) However, under this "clever" condition, we, who call ourselves "vast," "resourceful," and "populous" China, do not know what kind of road we will take?</p>
<h3>Recall</h3>
<p>— Jia</p>
<p>Ah, whether it is an illusion, a dream, or reality, I will always be the unfortunate one in the world. And only in my dreams can I vaguely recall your face, what else can I hope for? The new tomb soil, the new epitaph, the new green grass, the infinite sorrow of melancholy and death, when the moonlight reflects the shadow of the window, when the autumn wind blows the fallen flowers and leaves, Nini: to whom can I cry out my full of tragic feelings? You sleep forever in the dark with irredeemable youthful regrets, and my pure love is also prepared to be buried forever in the cold and barren depths of my heart. Nini, your life disappeared for my freedom, I never thought that I had just returned from hell to the sunny world, but you quietly</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>quietly closed your eyes. Your nineteen years of youthful light, as if it were a beautiful red hibiscus that grew in a tropical island, only smiled in the autumn and died in the blink of an eye. The yellow earth where you were born at night is the peaceful place where you rest for a long time, but on the soul of the toilers who are tired of the troubles of life, this encounter is more painful than the cut of a silver blade, and the invisible blood is constantly flowing down. The annoying drizzle shrouded the sunset on the sea, and my heart was as dark as night. On such a rainy evening, in front of the flower bushes, I mourn for your vast and lonely soul, what else can I expect besides tea, Nini!</p>
<p>I love the gentle and beautiful scenery of the seashore, and you grew up in the beautiful scenery of the seashore. There, in the distance of the sea, in the distance of the shore, the blue sky covers the blue sea, and the blue sea rippling in the warm embrace of the high sun, lying under the shady coconut grove, the green grass is a natural soft mattress, looking at the flocks of white-feathered seagulls overhead, turning away for a while, turning near for a while, near and far, throwing a string of clear singing. And the clouds are carried on their backs, making various illusory and beautiful patterns of changing postures, Nini, your fiery enthusiasm is the unique endowment of this marine country, and your eyes, which are always covered with a layer of thin mist, are full of the feeling of missing distant friends, because you have seen since childhood the woman seeing off her lover at the end of the river, wearing big red pants, leaning on the man who is traveling far away, whispering occasionally, but also gnawing her arm to cut off the golden bracelet, as a souvenir of the close heart, the shadow of the sail flickering in the smoke, how much bearing the boundless parting feeling!</p>
<p>Nini, I still clearly remember that we often walked slowly side by side on the path between the slender grasslands that was dyed purple by the sunset, and the new moon showed half of its face from the corner of the sky on the other side of the sea. As we walked, you would sing Pédrol's Moonlight Sonata in a low voice, and I would harmonize with the whistle. At this time, the golden sunset plated the edge of the sea with gold, and your face was even more moving with an unspeakable emotion. The four fields were so quiet, without half a sound, only the cool evening breeze rolled the song into the waves. However, this gentle intoxication has now become an unbearable and bitter memory!</p>
<p>Ah! Nini, the autumn wind has once again draped a bleak breath on the world. When the chapel rings out the sad copper cymbals in the morning and evening, do you know that there is a lonely and secluded shadow wandering on the deserted ancient road, offering sacrifices to the moon and the wild towards the distance of the sea? You actually left so lightly, so suddenly, and so quietly, like a cloud, like a wisp of smoke. There was no concern at all, could it be that there is really nothing in this world that is worth you to miss a little more? That can't be, Nini, only I know that you were buried deep in the ground with unavowed eternal hatred, because the visitor who conveyed the news of your misfortune to me, he said with a very gloomy expression that when you were about to stop your last breath, you didn't leave a word to the people next to you, nor did you say anything, but just called my name frequently in your throat, after that, you turned your eyelids, and quietly closed them. Alas! Nini, when I finished listening to this terrible narrative and the terrifying image drawn by the visitor's mouth, in an instant, I almost froze there, and almost fainted.</p>
<p>Everything is as illusory as smoke! Who would have thought that the weeds embracing the soil would be your eternal home. And I, this weak and weary survivor who has traveled through the world, will come to receive the pain of the soul plus a layer of silent tearing. Now: I have no ideals, no thoughts, no dreams, and no tears. I am living my days in an ice cellar!</p>
<h3>Small Song of the Cage (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Qin Jian</p>
<p>I have visited the zoo many times, and I have also been to the bird market in the market; therefore, a kind of noisy, large number of small animals' clamor floats out from the densely arranged, stacked boxes and fences: the sound is chaotic; however, it has an endless heaviness, it suppresses and suffocates a kind of human soul, like a snake, like a meteorite.</p>
<p>However, the passing crowds laugh happily; the small animals' cries heal the fatigue of the human world: "Look, darling, how happy, how lovely, how moving these beautiful little things sing - say, right?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but your voice is even more beautiful, darling."</p>
<p>Then they appreciate and tease, with a light heart, leisurely passing one cage after another.</p>
<p>(Young people, learn to enjoy an era that is more suitable for joy - youth is free, youth is unconstrained, youth is sacred and precious!)</p>
<p>However, who would have thought? The small animals that are separated from the vast world outside and caught and placed in golden cages, they - thousands of them, what they remember day and night, may not be the kind of humiliation and plaything for which they exchanged freedom, but a green blade of grass in the distant wilderness, and a crystal clear but worthless spring water!</p>
<p>And those huge calls - the calls that are arbitrarily recognized as beautiful songs and appreciated by people, are they really as beautiful as the charming serenade under the moon?</p>
<h3>Another Circus Comes to Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Ge</p>
<p>After Haijingbo ran into a wall in Japan, he came to China and actually returned with a full load. This powerful propaganda made the second circus come directly to China, but the seats were not selling well, and it finally fled. According to those who have watched it, the exotic animals and skills of the two classes are not too different, but the difference in the sales of seats is incredible; moreover, the former sold the highest seat price to a huge five yuan, and made a fortune, which can be said to be fortunate and unfortunate.</p>
<p>In fact, this is the simplest thing. The idle class living in this big city, without worrying about food and clothing, living comfortably, want to pass the long years, and want to come up with some novel toys at all times to seek spiritual stimulation, but the villagers think that kaleidoscope-like Shanghai, in their opinion, has long been plain and unremarkable. Haijingbo's taking the road to Shanghai is exactly the right medicine for the disease, and it is natural to return with a full load.</p>
<p>This is one example. Other things such as magic and song and dance troupes are also like this. When the first class came to Shanghai, the seats were sold for as much as five yuan. Those who came after, although using strange and shocking advertisements such as "living zombies" or "virgins" to call for them, the results were not as good as expected. The blue-eyed people only know that China is a good market for buying and selling, but they do not fully understand the taste of the Chinese people; this refers to entertainment, and others may not necessarily be the case, because the Chinese are deeply imprinted, and foreign countries are all good!" impression.</p>
<p>Now there is another British Aesop Gu Circus coming to China, and the advertisement for the opening on the 21st of this month has been seen in the newspaper. From those tigers and monkeys shouted out of the megaphone, "Shanghai is coming soon!" The slogan is as hopeful as the "Air Lottery is drawn this afternoon" in front of the smoke shop, but the future of this large circus with "120 European and American artists, 24 famous singing and dancing actors, 50 horses, 8 elephants, 10 lions, 12 tigers, and camels and zebras, etc." is not optimistic, right?</p>
<p>Because Haijingbo's impression has not disappeared, the circus's tricks are just like this, and in the spring, the young masters and misses will never give up the opportunity to go to Tiger Hill and Lingyin to play. Those who cannot travel are not qualified to watch the "excellent performance" of the circus. Although when Haijingbo was performing, some people desperately crowded towards the hexagonal seats and fell from the high ladder, now I am afraid that there will never be this great courage!</p>
<h3>Before and After Returning Home (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Chonglin</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>It was early in the morning when we arrived in Hong Kong. The ship docked in Kowloon, and the three and a half of us—including Mr. Wang!—went ashore and first took a quick tour of Kowloon.</p>
<p>"Is this place nice?" I asked my child.</p>
<p>"No," he replied, "but it's very funny."</p>
<p>Hearing his words, we couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>The ferry from Kowloon to Hong Kong was filled with British people living in Kowloon who worked in Hong Kong. The Chinese people were all coolies and laborers.</p>
<p>We entered a dim sum restaurant with advertisements of snakes and tigers painted at the entrance. As soon as we sat down, we regretted it. A small round table inlaid with fake marble was wet, but the owner repeatedly told us to put our things on it, saying it was clean. As we were hesitating about whether to eat or not, the shrimp dumplings were brought out, and the shrimp were still transparent, far from being cooked. At this moment, two men in silk gowns and trousers sat down next to us, talking in a language we couldn't understand, watching us, and absentmindedly picking at their feet.</p>
<p>We fled the dim sum restaurant as if escaping.</p>
<p>Then the three and a half of us went to stroll the streets.</p>
<p>"Look at that advertisement, it's blocking my eyesight," someone among the three said first.</p>
<p>The further east you go, the more advertisements there are. Eastern merchants are the best at advertising, especially the Chinese. In this respect, they are exactly like the Jews. They all want to hang as many advertisements as possible, with bright reds and greens to attract attention. However, their neighbors on the left, right, and across the street think and do the same thing. As a result, the advertising flags of the shops on both sides block a small street. In the end, their own advertisements obscure their own advertisements, and passersby are unwilling to pay attention to these advertisements that are too numerous and unclear. I am one of those who are unwilling to pay attention to these advertisements. (The End)</p>

<h3>Paul Muni Says He Can Be Happy with $25 a Week Too (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Suyin</p>
<p>Paul Muni then unhurriedly stated his two major reasons. He said, "My first reason is that money can provide security for those I love. My mother and father both tasted the bitterness of hunger and suffered the humiliation of poverty. Their lives were often filled with terror—terror of the landlord, terror of the winter cold, and so on. These things had a greater impact on them than on me as an individual because I was young and had great ambitions. But their suffering left an indelible impression on my mind.</p>
<p>"If I were just a single person, I wouldn't have to worry about any security. But since I have a wife and family, I have to seek financial security for them. My wife has never asked for any security. She is willing to follow me anywhere. If I were to give up everything and become a beggar, she would definitely follow me. But on my part, I would rather she never felt any deprivation again. And the more virtuous a woman is, the more you feel you should do your best for her.</p>
<p>"Speaking of my second reason, it is that I hope to one day build my own small theater troupe... or I can produce my own films. These films don't necessarily have to feature me, and they certainly don't have to make money. But they must be good films. My plans for the future are not yet decided, so I can't say much more now. All I want to say is that I want to have good works in the performing arts, and money can help me achieve that.</p>
<p>"In my opinion, the actors in the Soviet Union are the best in the world. They are good actors, but they are not famous. Their job is to perform in the theater, not to show off in society. The theater is their work, their life, their world. I live my life that way too. So when I have to play a miner, I want to be a real miner. I go down into the mines to learn what miners are like. I want to learn how miners think. After I think like a miner, my actions and speech will be just like a miner. This kind of preparation work always takes several weeks before filming begins.</p>
<p>"Then, I also have to do makeup tests. I don't like makeup. I think true art doesn't need makeup, but I can't do without it. But when I have to use makeup, I must strive for realism. I have a makeup 'testing room' at home. I often try out new effects in my makeup room at night.</p>
<p>"And I often use a recording machine, whether at home or on the set, to say the lines into the recording machine, and then play back the recorded sound. I examine my own tone to see if it is appropriate. Sometimes I spend an hour practicing a single line, trying to be as realistic as possible in every way. But once I finish shooting a film, I never watch it again. I want to throw it away and forget it, like a duck shaking off the water on its back, because I must throw away and forget the role in the first film before I can plan to start shooting the second film.</p>
<p>"After I finish a film, I don't watch it again. I immediately start talking about plays and stories, looking for new topics. Sometimes, after a film is released, someone asks me if I like that film, and I will be at a loss for an answer, because I have forgotten how I performed. I force myself to forget. Maybe this is also a kind of psychological reaction.</p>
<p>"It's true, I love performing, but I also hate performing. I love performing because I get a kind of thrill, a thrill when an artistic expression is successful. But I hate it because performance often involves dishonesty and baseness. Therefore, I have infinite respect for honest actors, but I have no sympathy for those actors who use performance to cheat for money and fame."</p>
<p>From the above conversation, we can know many of Paul Muni's unique characteristics. He is an honest actor. He has no hypocrisy or concealment. He has a kind of superhuman spirit—he can get performance remuneration and comfort from his work. From this point of view, we can understand that when he says that he can be happy with $25 a week, he is not just talking nonsense. (The End)</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3>Review of "Human Relations" - New Light</h3>
<p>— Zhaoren</p>
<p>People have compared this film to "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang," but I think this is unnecessary, because these two films have very few similarities. "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" is mainly valuable in exposing the darkness of American prisons, while this film, although it also uses a little material about prisoners, has absolutely no meaning of exposure. "Human Relations" and "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" are completely different in interest.</p>
<p>As an ethical film, "Human Relations," the playwright, although he gives sympathy to the protagonist, a dock worker, at least the depiction of his life's suffering and unfortunate encounters occupies a part of the film's footage. However, the playwright does not depict the most typical posture of their group on the protagonist, but finds a very cowardly and also considered kind person among this group as the object of sympathy, and the misfortune he encounters is because he is muddle-headed from drinking, which leads to disaster, so this misfortune is exactly the misfortune of this muddle-headed person who likes to drink and gamble, that is, his wife and children left behind when he was sentenced to prison are lucky. She became the mistress of a paint merchant, and the paint merchant made a fortune in the First World War, jumping from the position of a small merchant to a bank manager, so this coolie's wife unexpectedly became a noble lady, and her son is also the head of the vault.</p>
<p>Originally, there may indeed be all kinds of wonders in the world, and this kind of thing can be established in the playwright's imagination. Moreover, not only that, but coincidentally, after that muddle-headed worker was released from prison, the playwright even made him a servant under his own son, with the biological son kicking the biological father, as the central fulcrum of this ethical film. Later, the protagonist loves his son deeply, risking his life to rescue his son from danger, and ending up with a tragic death, but not getting his wife's understanding. Although his son understands that he is a good person after his death.</p>
<p>This tortuous plot is given great attention by writers in the current development of Chinese films. At least it is of interest to the general audience who demand bizarre plots, if the author can express this plot in a cinematic artistic way as well. But this is something that cannot but disappoint people, and perhaps the author himself will feel the pain of disappointment, because they have not achieved the original expected effect. First, in terms of the composition of the story, no matter how the playwright finds the reasons for Yu Sanjin and the bank manager, this is exactly the flaw that cannot be concealed: Ma Lu Yingxiong, played by Xie Yunqing, should know how Mr. Lu made a fortune and that Yu San's son is "Oil Bottle," etc. (at least there is no reason to say that he does not know.) Therefore, on what basis would he introduce his own father, Yu San, to him, and Yu San is not a clever person, what use is an old waste to bandits? There are many other piles, which cannot be listed one by one. Similarly, in terms of technical issues, there are no particularly good achievements in directing and acting. In addition to flaunting some cleverness, the director cannot promote the moving emotions of tragedy in any way. The protagonist, Xi Jianong, has achieved a slight achievement in personality, but cannot make the play that should be played, especially in terms of makeup, the fake hunchback and the beard of old age are very sloppy. The others are just average and can pass.</p>
<h3>Review of "Imitation of Life"</h3>
<p>— Zhongfei</p>
<p>Imitation of Life — Nanjing</p>
<p>Dear readers, if you have seen the film "Imitation of Life," I guess you must have been very moved. Here is the development of such a profound understanding of human relationships, here is the in-depth excavation of the sadness and joy of life's tastes. Yes, the original author described the ultimate love and sincerity of ethics from the bodies of two pairs of mothers and daughters. She hinted that only the greatness of maternal love can surpass everything. These are expressed in the movie, and director John M. Stahl has very successfully achieved the success of literary film art.</p>
<p>In order to use the duck (toy) as the final ending, the opening is a close-up of the duck. Immediately, the little daughter's unwillingness to go to the nursery explains that the widow Fei Ya needs someone to help manage the household. When she has to leave her little daughter to go out for a living, although she cannot do it financially. She is a capable and quick-witted woman, taking phone calls (introducing her background), taking care of the children, and taking care of the kitchen at the same time. The black woman, Anti-Thelila's request for employment is, of course, just right. In these few scenes, we see that the director is not only able to vividly depict the personality of the main characters, but also successfully assigns actors to the landlord, painter, and others in a very appropriate way. Similarly, the appearance of Niels Pike, who plays Elman, shows the same posture in films such as "42nd Street," from smelling the aroma of the cake to teaching them to sell canned powder after eating the cake. His lovely personality is expressed very clearly.</p>
<p>After a woman succeeds in her career, she needs a passionate man. This has been mentioned many times by the black woman. When the fish scientist Warren William appears, he cannot find the doorbell at night, which makes us see the characteristics of a scholar. However, when he dances with Fei Ya, played by Claudette Colbert, after entering the door, his almost romantic posture inevitably destroys the unified personality, although he performs very well in his later enthusiasm and honesty. However, when the love between men and women and the love between mother and daughter conflict, when Fei Ya sees the black woman losing her daughter and dying in sadness, she deeply feels the disillusionment of love, and rejects her lover in the moonlight and recalls the joy between mother and daughter.</p>
<p>The greatness of maternal love is used here as the theme of the whole play. Because the original author wanted to express this point, he made the mother Fei Ya and the black woman work for their daughters. However, the black woman's daughter is ashamed of her race. She doesn't want her black mother. She resolutely leaves her mother and goes far away, causing her mother to die in depression. Faedi Washington, who plays the 19-year-old, really performs with great inner expression in a few scenes. In particular, the director handles the funeral with extremely slow rhythms, and Faedi's extremely sad caressing of the coffin and painful confession moves us deeply to tears. It is here that the success of the tragedy is expressed technically.</p>
<p>In the United States, there was indeed Lincoln's call to liberate black slaves, but even now black people have not escaped the status of slaves. They are discriminated against by the civilized white people as people of color. In the eyes of American writers, this is of course considered unreasonable, but how does the original author Fannie Hurst express her understanding? She shows her best effort to change from black to white through her daughter. She shows that since black people are God's creation, what else is there to say? The only thing that can be done is to have money, so that you can show off at a magnificent funeral after death. Such a performance is just a white person's cat crying over a mouse's sympathy.</p>
<p>Writing up to this point, I have generally talked about various aspects of this film. Due to the limitation of space, I cannot write in more detail, which is really a pity. However, there is one more point that must be mentioned, and that is the acting skills of Claudette Colbert, the protagonist in the play. She is truly a talented and well-trained actor. She performs just the right amount without overdoing it. Whether it is her face or her figure, she shows that she is very well-trained in acting. This shows that this is a concentration of excellent technical talents in all aspects, and has completed this "Imitation of Life" with extremely high technical achievements.</p>
<p>(1) Publication of "A Grand View of Chinese Film Stars"</p>
<p>The "A Grand View of Chinese Film Stars," edited by Chen Jiuzhen and published by the Yisheng Publishing House at No. 133, Yuanmingyuan Road, Shanghai, has received enthusiastic reservations since the reservation began on March 15. The number of books exceeded the original number, so the publication must be extended for two days. It is heard that the printing of the book is undertaken by the Commercial Press, which is the leader in the Chinese printing industry. The results are satisfactory, as can be expected. It will meet movie fans this Thursday. Film Novel</p>
<h3>Amateur Reporter (After Office Hours) (11)</h3>
<p>— Tongyun</p>
<p>Sharon looked a little strange. When Pennister came in, she wanted to ask him. Pennister, while asking Sharon to tie his tie, put on a kind of wry smile. Sharon said, "I saw you." Her voice trembled. She felt a burst of fear in her heart. She felt like screaming. When he turned around to look towards his own room, she ran towards the door, wanting to escape. But he already knew and chased after her, grabbing Sharon. Now he knew the strength of his hand. She knew. She screamed, "Don't touch me! Don't touch me! You did it! You killed her!"</p>
<p>The door suddenly burst open. Brown and Baer walked in, both covered in mud. Brown said with a cold smile, "Sorry, we're a little late. Because after we saw him disappear into the water time and time again, we spent a lot of effort climbing out of that big pile of wood." Sharon quickly interjected, "That's right. On the night the murder happened, he went out to get wood..." Pennister's eyes, fixed on Sharon, shone with a terrifying, fierce light. Brown said, "So he went to the woodpile last night, did he? That's enough to send him to the electric chair."</p>
<p>Sharon then asked, "By the way, how did you know that Julia Patterson lost a powder compact last night?" Brown said, "I didn't know. I just wanted to see what he would do." Sharon, upon hearing this, could no longer hide all her love and admiration. Pennister suddenly charged towards Brown, but Brown was too quick. With a swing of his fist, Pennister was already on the ground. After Brown knocked Pennister down, he calmly instructed Baer, "Call the police first. After you've made the call, keep an eye on this murderer, and let me call the newspaper. This is big news. This is exclusive to us."</p>
<p>The next morning, Mrs. Nasgoth was having breakfast. She was talking about the Patterson case that was published in the newspaper. She was reluctant to put it down, reading it, even though her coffee had gone cold. Suddenly, the servant came in to report, "Mr. Jordan has arrived." As soon as Jordan entered, he asked, "Can I see Jem? Jem Brown?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Nasgoth felt confused, but the servant deliberately coughed and reported, "Mr. Brown is at home." Jordan said, "He must be here. Half an hour ago, he called the newspaper, asking them how to continue investigating the case. We found out that the call was made from here." The servant said, "That's right. Mr. Brown and Miss Sharon are together. They are in the guest bedroom."</p>
<p>Mrs. Nasgoth, upon hearing this, immediately ran outside, with Jordan chasing after her. She walked to the door of the guest room, first knocking on the door, and then opening the door herself and walking in. It would have been better if she hadn't entered, because she was shocked when she did. At this moment, Sharon was still fast asleep in bed, and Jem, wearing a dressing gown, was sitting on the edge of the bed. Mrs. Nasgoth, upon seeing this, opened her mouth, unable to utter a single word, and fell into a chair.</p>
<p>Sharon suddenly woke up, and she smiled as soon as she opened her eyes. She said to her mother, "This was his idea." Her eyes, full of tears, looked at Jem with an indescribable deep affection. Jem then said, "It was one of my best ideas." Sharon said with a smile again, "He said it was too late, it was already four o'clock in the morning, there was no need to disturb you, to make you get out of bed to see us get married." Mrs. Nasgoth said, "Married? You got married?" Brown smiled and nodded, then said to Jordan, "What are you here for? You should go back to the newspaper quickly. You know, this is a critical moment. Do you think I can still manage the newspaper's affairs? I'm on my honeymoon now." (The End)</p>
