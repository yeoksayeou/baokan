<h3 id="c22">上海電話加價問題 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— 昂</p>
<p>上海電話公司依照一九三〇年八月五日與上海公共租界及法租界工部局訂立之營業特許合同所規定。要求自本年四月一日起。增加價目。俾公司得享投資純利百分之八又百分之二。此項要求發動於本年一月間。工部局初有允意。嗣以各界商民一致反對。工部局亦覺衆議難違。電話加價事遂成僵局。迨納稅西人年會通過議案。請工部局董事會與電話公司磋商緩行加價。並建議組織特別委員會。聘任專家一人或數人。審核加價事宜。工部局本此决議。卽與電話公司一再磋商。最後始决定暫行普加百分之十一。而將此後加價問題。交特別委員會核覆再議。</p>
<p>工部局所聘之電話專家原不過英籍一人。嗣以中日兩方力爭。增設中日兩席。電話公司方面以公司係屬美商。要求增聘美。籍專家工部局亦徇其請。再增一席。同時法租界工部局以本身係獨立機關。對於電話加價不願依人成事。婉辭公共租界工部局之邀請。自行聘請法籍電話專家一人。待專家委員會舉行會議時。列席旁聽以資合作。中日英法專家日前齊集上海。美國專家亦於昨日抵滬。在最近期間。各專家當可就本埠目前之電話事業。作一度詳盡之調查。從而求一公平妥善之定價辦法。一面使市民擔負不致增加。公用利便不受影響。一面則使公司從開支之撙節。及組織之改善。以求投資利益之穩定。本埠市民所期望於各專家者。如是而已。</p>
<p>上海電話公司今次要求加價。一方面主張增加總收入百分之二二·八。俾公司之投資純利得達百分之十之數。一方面主張採用按次收費之新制。吾人對於普行新制。在原則上可無異議。惟於所謂增加純利一點。則不能無言。該公司去牟度之純利爲百之六·一三。此在百業蕭條之今日。亦差可自豪。今必欲根據特許營業合同。將純利增至百分之十。未免對於今日社會狀况欠缺注意。蓋就今日一般用戶之負祖能力以觀。增價未必卽足增加公司之純利。或謂百分之十純利。乃工部局特許營業合同所規定。公司實有堅持之理由。此種見解亦殊膚淺。要知國際條約尚可根據國際法上「情勢變遷」之原則或修改或廢止。普通商業契約豈有一成不變之理。</p>
<p>抑電話公司所謂純利者。當係指一年中公司之總收入與總支出間之差數而言。查公司一年中所支出者。包含一定指數之折舊。募股費用之攤還。美國徵收之年稅。資本以外各項收入之利息。營業權之年稅經營及管理費用等項。其中公司財產之折舊。美國政府之所得稅及公司管理費等三項。爲數甚鉅。今不列入專家調查範圍之內。吾人殊不可解。且據公司方面自稱。營業費用。極爲簡省。但就南京路商界聯合會致工部局函中所述。電話公司委托上海電力公司修理話具之費用每年。達四十萬兩之鉅。而廣告聞歸某公司承辦。爲數亦頗可觀。外籍職員所支厚薪。似尤難免有超過一般標準者。凡此皆關公司內部之業務。非局外人所願過問但於全般問題。不無相當影響。未知各專家亦能加以考慮否。</p>

<p>國外貿易漸見起色　我國絲業以出口為大宗、近年以來、國外市塲、受日絲傾銷影響、以致華絲充斥於市、絲織業異常衰落、銷路亦減、存貨堆積、絲廠商人瀕於破產、各廠停業殆盡、今春國外市塲、華絲漸見起色、駐滬各洋行、均先後採辦、以致國內存絲大量出口、價格隨之高漲、</p>
<p>已停各廠先後開工　目前截止、B字等級二十至二十二條紋華絲、洋行（國外）價格每包約國幣五百元、用戶（國內）價格每包約　幣五百十元、較六月份價格比較增加約國幣一百元左右、以致已停各廠、先後開工繅絲、計上海市虹口閘北南市租界四區開工絲廠、有復昶·永記·久記·原記·積餘·宏昶·興昌·等三十三家、無錫計四十二家、浙江計十六家、但較最盛之際、以滬山而言、為一百十三家、仍僅及三分之一、</p>
<p>價格高漲出口激增　價格高漲後、華絲出口激增、如今年八月半月華絲出口、（一）歐洲為一千五百八十包、計廢絲四百零八包、雙宮絲五包、灰絲七十六包、黃絲四十四包、輯里絲一百二十二包、黃廠絲九十九包、白廠絲八百二十六包、（二）美洲為一千七百三十一包、計廢絲一百零四包、灰絲一百包、黃絲七十包、輯里絲二百十六包、黃廠絲十包、白廠絲一千二百三十一包、三印度等處為八百四十一包、白土絲七十四包、廢絲四百五十四包、雙宮絲六十二包、黃土絲二百零四包、白廠絲四十七包、總計四千一百五十二包、</p>
<p>存繭將罄缺乏原料　滬市各絲廠、因存繭無多、致發生原料缺乏恐慌、均已分別準備組織收買秋繭機關、惟因浙江省施行統制、指定四區准外商絲商採購、致所購無幾、業已由滬絲廠同業公會、電浙江省政府免予統制、新聲社記者昨向滬絲廠商探悉、唯一盼望浙江省免予統制、准許滬商自由儘量收買、否則滬廠將無原料可繅、被迫停業、間接與工人生計、影響甚鉅云、</p>

<p>— 美國奧爾珂德女士原著鄭曉滄（宗海）譯</p>
<p>白迪克的痛苦是在有一個彎曲的背脊，可是他這麼愉快地忍受他的苦難，所以小橋有一次竟以他的那種希奇的口吻問道，『駝背可以給人好脾氣嗎？假如可以的話，我倒也要一個。」迪克總是歡歡喜喜勉力和其他童子作伴，一樣高興，原來在這個孱弱的小身體裏，却寓有一種勇敢的精神呢。當他初來時，他自己很威覺到他的不幸，然而不久已漸與相忘，幷且也沒人再敢對他提到這一點，因爲某次一個孩子笑了他，就被裴先生重重責罰了一頓。</p>
<p>『上帝倒是怎麽介意它的；因爲雖然我的背是彎了，我的心却是直的』，迪克那時對虐待者那麽苦訴着，裴氏夫婦深深領受了這個意思，不久居然能使他漸漸相信別人確也愛他的心，也不管他的身怎樣，除非是憐惜他或幫助他去担當這點苦難。</p>
<p>一次正在和別人玩『萬牲園』的時候，一個人問道，「你扮什麽呢，迪克？』</p>
<p>「啊我是那個單峯駝；不看見我背上那個肉峯嗎？』是他令人發笑的回答。</p>
<p>『正是正是，我的好小孩，那倒是不須載重的，祗是和大衆並做開路先錢罷了，」小橋說着，其時他正在布置那個獅虎龍蛇的奇陣。</p>
<p>『我希望別人也能善待這個怪苦惱的好孩子，這我相信我的孩子們是己學到了的，」蜀夫人說道，見到她的敎授的成功，自是十分欣慰，那時迪克正蹺一拐經過她的面前，看去像是一個很快樂，雖然還是一個很瘦弱的小駱駝，傍着了强碩的「太腓」，—那人扮着」個大象，一搖一擺地前進，煞是神氣呢！</p>

<p>這是一條從狄思威路直達新上海的路，終日的煩器，足以呈出它具體的委態。</p>
<p>太陽方才從雲　里射出它强大的光芒的時候，其美路上的一切，已開始演出它的熟閙和嘈雜了！</p>
<p>自備車，出差車，各大學的校車，以及高聳而遲笨的運貨車，一大串，一大串……在它們的尾巴後曳着一縷一縷的靑烟，倥偬地在這柏油建築的其美路的脊脊上爬動着。還有那些上海市衛生局糞車，也在嘰哩咕嚕的亂饗。所以其美路上的早上祗有這些東西神氣活現的交織着。</p>
<p>在其美路的口上，擺滿了那許多「彎腰牌」的香烟攤，他們用着什麽美麗牌，金鼠牌，公司牌……壳子，里面就是裝滿了他們所製造的「彎腰牌」香烟，一包包很有程序的堆着。他們時常向着般黃包車夫，小工等人物兜着生意說：「喂！香烟刮刮呌，每包祗賣五個銅子……」。</p>
<p>這里可以說是一個江北人的大本營。他們是常做慣大好佬的，倘使他們遇到懦弱的人，便會拉你到茶館里去講道理，順便敲敲竹槓！</p>
<p>這里的商店在其美路的前面是櫛比着的，有幾家商店裝起了那迷人的無綫電想吸引着一般顧客的光臨，可是這里祗有聽的人點綴在他們的店面。</p>
<p>其美路第一橋的兩旁，都是許多貧困的江北人根據地，他們所居的多數是純粹的茅屋，但，以船爲屋的也不在少數；這里四面的臭氣，隨着風向人們的鼻子里鑽進去，那種味兒，令人怪難受的！</p>
<p>從其美路第二橋向後，就完全顯出一個鄉村的景象，田野間充溢了些靑的，紅的，黃的，……這些顏色點綴在這其美路上，彷彿是一副美麗的圖畫。再後到市中心的地方，那便是另一個景象了。</p>
<p>在市政府等機關散寫字間的時候，它們的車子，多數活躍在其美路上送着辦公的職員回去。</p>
<p>當太陽已頻近地平綫了，於是其美路上一盞盞路燈，都不約而同的亮起來了；平坦的其美路靜靜地躺在半明不滅的路燈下面。</p>

<p>旅客們有好事的，當那搬行李的聽差經過身邊的時候，也就因話答話，問專員到西北來有什麼公事？聽差很隨便的答應一聲查案。有了這種話，大家由面如鍋底，人像包文正這一節上面猜着，這個人一定是笑比黃河淸，鐵面無私值得一看於是都在路口上眼巴巴的望着。大家也都想着，像西安這地方，旱災兵災之後，元氣還沒有恢復，似乎沒有什麽大案子，要中央大員來查辦。不過中央大員畢竟是來了，也就不能說絕對無事。因之大家除了好奇心而外，實在也要瞻仰瞻仰貴人的顏色如何。到了下午四點多鐘，飯店門口，有汽車的喇叭聲嚮，這算是那藍專員已經到了。先到的那幾個歡迎人員，都跑到飯店門口去迎接，張介夫頭上汗如雨下，也隨着到大門口去接。這時，張先生歡迎的熱狂，也傳到了志前耳朶裏去。他覺着這事有點異乎平常，雖然不屑於去趕這種熟鬧，也是情不自禁的，隨了號議論紛紜的勢子，緩步走了出來。到了前面店門口時，也恰好那藍專員由汽車上下來。這裏瞻仰專員的人，心裏多想着，那份包老爺的大黑臉，雖不至於出現，然料着也必是身體魁梧，文帶武相的一位大員。及至幾位代表散開，將藍先生現了出來，却是一位五十多歲的老者，尖削的臉兒，撑出兩個顴骨，帽子下的兩鬢，都斑白了。身上穿了一件古銅色的綢夾袍子，高高的拱起了他的脊梁，走起路來，一步邁不了一尺，其緩也就可知。（二九五）</p>

<p>因爲玫瑰花的顏色不但不能幾千萬朶完全一樣；便是同在一朶上的花瓣，也往往深淡各別；如把這種深淡各別的花瓣一起收來，搗成液汁，結果便難望能有顏色鮮明，勻凈的胭脂可得，至少必不能和一朶顏色極正常的鮮玫瑰花相比。因此，我們把許多玫瑰花採來之後，必須逐一檢騐，祗把顏色正常的花瓣摘下備用，其餘的一概棄去；這種揀選工作，不但很費時間，而且也不是一個毫無經騐的生手所能從事的。…」</p>
<p>伊說到這裏我立刻就明白了，怪不得我常在某一座偏殿裏瞧見有幾個太監圍着一隻大竹筐，像搜覓什麽寳貝一般的細心地揀摘着玫瑰花辦，原來是爲着做胭脂用的！</p>
<p>「待到顏色正常的玫瑰花辦揀滿了相當的數量以後，」太后津津有味有繼續給我講解道：「於是便把它們安在潔淨的石臼裏，慢慢的　，一直椿到花瓣成厚漿一般才歇；接着再用細紗製成的濾器濾過，使一切雜質完全濾去，成爲最明掙的花汁，這樣就得開始做胭脂的最重要的一部份工作了……。」</p>
<p>太后的梳妝檯上一向就安着好幾方鮮紅色的絲棉，這是我久巳知道的；此刻伊就隨手拈起一方來，並用一柄金製的小剪刀；輕輕地從這上面剪下了很小的一塊來。（三九五）</p>

<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>閒得委實無聊隨手檢起一本紅樓夢來，正好是瑞大叔正照風月鑑的那一段。讀了一遍，心中忽然的若有所感。</p>
<p>我認得才是前天，有一位朋友對我說，「你若在街上遇見了身段婀娜，曲綫豐富的可喜娘，最好是亦步亦趨的跟在伊背後端詳賞鑒，却切不可這到伊前面去，而回過頭來晙一眼。因爲在背後瞧，你可以理想伊的美。可是瞧了伊的芳容，十回之中，必有九回以上，是使你失望的。你要知道普天之下，十全十美的美人，一萬之中，不知可能挑出一二個來的呀。」</p>
<p>當時我聽了他的高論，也不置可否。如今證以風月鑑的正照與反照之論，我不禁恍然大悟於朋友的高論。</p>
<p>不過我仔細地想了一想，覺得朋友的話，是不對的。瞧哪，正照了風月鑑，是一個鈎魂攝魄的王熙鳳，反照了，是一個空空洞洞的大骷髏。作者的苦口婆心，是勸人領悟着美女卽骷髏，骷髏卽美女的意思。如今我那朋友，還勸我對着女人的背影，去憶想女人的正面的美，那豈非是對着風月鑑反面的骷髏，而猶冥想着王熙鳳的美麗，那豈非是自速敗亡了麽？</p>
<p>因此，我以爲在街上見了背影俊俏的娘兒們，該把伊的背影，當作風月鑑的正面，而該急急地追到前面去瞧。因爲天下無十全十美的美人，身段苗條的，伊的芳容，雖不是一個大骷髏，或許是一個母夜叉呀。若能把這個母夜叉，作爲是沒皮沒肉的大骷體，那自然是更澈底了。這便是所謂反照風月鑑。</p>

<h3 id="c184">現代文學中的頹廢性 <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— 梅雨</p>
<p>在現代的英國文學中，勞倫斯的神秘主義，喬伊斯的精神分析，自然可以代表英國市民文學的特徵。勞倫斯的作品差不多全都涉及性的問題，他着重心理分析；然而所寫的並不是自覺的（Conscious）亦不是半自覺的，（Subconscious）而是不自覺的（Unconscious）；就是說他略去常態的心理描寫，僅僅描寫那些遏制於心的深處的不自覺的意念而已（這與題材偏重於性問題上有着極大的關係。）至於喬伊斯呢，用拉狄克的話說來，他以爲藝術家的任務是借助於照相機，通過顯微鏡頭向一座糞堆拍照；他承認作家在寫作的時侯應該像開演緩動電影一樣，一慕一慕地，不管這種動作是心靈的亦好，是肉體的亦好，一直到它結束。他沒有把現實生活如實地在作品裏具現出來，只是隨便扔起一些瑣碎的，不相關聯的東西，而把它補綴起來就算完事。他的代表作「幽利撒斯」跟吳爾芙（J．V．Woolf）的「桃羅蕙夫人」一樣，用一本書寫主人公一天間的心理，走一步路，說一句話，　一口烟的念頭都寫在書中。（這裏我們無妨附述一句，勞倫斯，喬伊斯，吳爾芙同伊里奧特（T．S．Ehot）是並稱為英國當今文壇的四巨頭的）。同樣在法國小說家普勞斯特也有同樣的傾向，他小心地描寫一些最無關重要的動作，並且用他特殊的—法國市民的與貴族中的最特殊部份的眼光給與最特殊部份的—站在支配地位上的最少數的人物以極精細的描寫，不過在這一方面，他是觸到了難比的深度同闊度的。這樣，我們便曉得了這類作家都有這麽一齣拿手好戲，在寫作上，他們都一樣玩弄看追種玄虛；可是心理分析（Psychoanalysi）這方法，在十九世紀初年度發現的時候，原是作爲一種極巧妙的剖解人生，理解人生的工具，而今日却被他們利用來掩蓋同粉飾活生生的現實的雄姿的工具了。</p>
<p>自然，他們在創作上這種態度，是有其社會的基礎的。當市民由進步退爲保守，而逐漸沒落時，當藝術的自由，創作思想的執拗，超然的文學的存在與發展的可能性同離開社會與政治的文學的獨立性等等被熱烈地主張着與擁護着時，就有許多作家，在不知不覺之間，縮小了他們對於現實生活的觀察的範圍，放棄了它的廣汎的同全面的研究，而停頓於「自己靈魂的孤獨」，再由於欠缺實生活的認識，自我思想的深化同固執等而隱身於「認識自我」的無結果的企圖之中。這樣就由個人主義而轉化爲的我中心主義（Egocentrism）了。這是二十世紀來市民文學沒落的原因，亦是這些沒落的作品產生的原因，亦是我們稱這一類作家爲頹廢的原因。</p>
<p>再進一步，我們說這些作家是頹廢的，乃是他們的作品不論是好是壞，只有在某種文化到了它的沒落期才能够產生出來。這類的作品不止在今日，就是在歷史上各個文化階段到了它的沒落期的時候亦一樣地產生出來。我們通常稱它爲「拜占庭型」（Byzantinism），而這個名詞亦就充分地顯示了這種意義了。至於我們稱他們爲頹廢的作家，並非說喬伊斯，普勞斯特等不是偉大的作家，恰恰相反，因爲這種頹廢本身亦具有它的積極性的，像喬伊斯等，在分析的聰明與敏感上，他們都到達了前此任何時期都難以比並的高度。這正如黑格爾所說的：「是密　爾瓦（Mineva司智慧的女神）的鴟梟在夜裏飛行」。每一種文化的落洛日的餘暉，較之它的任何一切，有時侯是更爲可愛的。</p>
<p>然而在莎士比亞，哥德，拉辛（Racine）等作家與喬伊斯，普勞斯特，勞倫　等作家的作品之間，是否有着差別呢？我想這是很容易理解的吧。自然，現代市民作家是聰明的，敏感的，以及有着較他們的前輩還要廣大同豐富的文學的傳統的。可是在他們的作品之間，有此都是奇特的，怪異的，在他們的前輩的作品中找不到的東西，我想這是不可諱法子說出其所以然，甚至不敢承認有這種特微存在着。無疑，要正確地解釋這種現象，只有在新的方法論的照明之下才能達到的。我想這些作家是現存的文化的一部份，而現存的文化又正在急　地墮落着。只有這才能夠說明這些近代的偉大作家的作品裏的特質。</p>
<p>最後我們還得明白，我們應不應當跟這些有頹廢傾向的作家們學習呢？這是個在我們出版界已經發揮過許多議論的問題，誰亦能够毫不猶豫地加以肯定的。不過關鍵只在我們應不應聽他們的指揮，還是要有我們自己的方針呢？要是我們的作家們能够深刻地認識喬伊斯是那一類的作家，而自己有着他正確的世界觀時，那麼喬伊斯不惟沒有阻碍我們，而且可以給我們許多益處；我們要研究他的作品，跟他學習怎樣處理着內容與形式，這一重要的課題。我們相信，偉大的文學家，不唯要向古典的作品去學習，同樣亦應該從沒落的市民文學去學習。唯有從最精粹的歷史遺產中發展出來的方法才是最偉大而又最正確的創作方法。</p>

<p>漁人不到一二分鐘就反這段故事講述比較我的定作還要簡單。一般人講述一個故事毫不思索；他們只把那些感動他們的事實叙述出來照他們所感覺的演成一句句的話。所以這種叙述，正如一斧頭一劈似的銳利而尖刻。</p>
<p>「我不願意到拔突斯去了！」包玲說，當我們走到湖上高的一面的時候。，我們沿着鹹濕之地回到娜克羅亦錫克。我們的漁人變成和我們一樣的沉默，他引領着我們穿過迷亂的道路。我們的靈魂遭逢着一大蛻變，我們旣沉陷在憂鬱的思念中，是由看到柴勃而知道他的悲劇所引起的。我們都很知道我們是爲了想着那三個人的事，我們的嚮導才沉默的。這三位的不幸，很顯明的出現我們的面前，好像一幕悲劇中的表演一樣，而他父親的贖罪，就是這幕劇的頂點。我們不敢遠望那不幸者坐着的盤石，他對於鄉間人是一個極大的恐怖。當我們目觸着一種平生未見的悲慘景象時，烏雲掩蔽着天空，烟霧從水平綫上達於天空。我們在荒凉而不潔的泥土上和鹹濕之地足　着，這濕　之地可稱爲地面生　症的地方。地面分爲不相等的許多方塊，每一方塊圍着灰色泥土的陷穴，並且充滿着鹽水，在上面，鹽凝集起來。這塊人工的窪地裏面，分有界限，携帶耘耙的工人，在上面走動着。他們　的少數沼澤中人，—這是製鹽者特有的名稱。這些人或這一類勃萊登人，穿着特別衣服，一件白色的短衣，像一個蒸酒的人。他們只和本族人通婚，在這個部落中找不到一個女子不同製鹽人而同別人結婚的例證。這些沼澤可怕的外觀，點綴着有規律爛泥方塊，灰色的大地上，不生一切勃萊登的花草，却興曾經刺　我們的靈魂上面的慘淡相調和。當我們達到淡水衝入的小灣，就那兒，裝點沙灘的荒蕪的植物，給我們極大的欣喜。當我們正在穿過去時，我們可以看見湖中矗立着轟座柴勃拉梅家族曾經住過的小島，我們把頭急扭轉開去。</p>
<p>達到我們的旅舍，我們注意到一張擺在一間底樓的房中的彈子桌。當我們知道這是娜克魯羅亦鍚地方僅有的一張公共彈子桌的時候，我們連夜準備行裝，預備離開，第二天，我們已經在居輪第城了。（完）</p>

<p>主人微皺着兩眉，微笑地斜着眼看蒼白臉一脹；蒼白臉也微微皺一下眉毛，回答他一個微笑。</p>
<p>「我看還是雜誌生意此較做得，至少也要看他幾分的利息……」</p>
<p>主人又斜着眼睛看倉白臉；但這回蒼白臉的兩眼却一直在看着前面，他坐在穿衣鏡旁邊的檯子前，喝一口剛送來的蓋盌茶，拿起主人遁過來的詩稿時，圓胖臉的聲音又鑽進耳朶里來了：</p>
<p>「我一、定要做他一下這雜誌生意……編輯也一定請他一個有名氣的……」</p>
<p>主人一直看見蒼白臉呆呆地半張開着嘴唇，眼光老停在詩稿的題目上。他於是皺一皺眉，但立刻他的耳朶也被圓胖臉的聲音牽引着：</p>
<p>「薪水大一點不要緊，栽得深，結得大……」</p>
<p>主人把臉掉過去；蒼白臉也跟着掉過去，但立刻他就和主人掉回來的眼光碰着，他於是趕快避開把自己的眼光掉回來，又盯住詩稿的題目，「我今天怎麼一下就這樣浮燥了？」他這麼一想，兩頰就更加發熱起來，於是恨不得主人就走開去。他兩眼對着詩稿偷偷地從眼角梢一看，主人果然站起來走了；走到兩個胖臉坐的中方一張茶几前面，撮着五指先揭開圓胖臉的茶盌蓋子看一看，便喊了起來；</p>
<p>「喂，拿開水來呀！」</p>
<p>蒼白臉却又被這聲音更有力地吸住了，耳朶特別尖起緊對着主人和圓胖臉的那面，竭力想一字不漏地聽見主人的要求「主編」雜誌的話聲；但同時却又音樂地希望着：「唉唉，不要就講吧，一講就完了！」他把耳朶尖了了好一會，還部會聽見主人和圓胖臉的說話聲，却又感到一種不滿足似的，但他忍耐住；但終於忍不住了，把臉掉過來一看，他才愉快地深深吐了一口氣，—原來主人已經不見了，就只那兩個胖臉在額對額地談話。他歪着頭向旁邊的穿衣鏡照一照，自己的蒼白鼻尖上居然凸出了幾十粒珠子似的油汗。他就掏出一方小白手巾來把鼻尖揩一揩，接着又把手巾包着一根小指頭掃一掃鼻孔。再仔細地對鏡照照，鼻尖又居然白臘似的光亮，美好。他掉過臉來，就看見圓胖臉正在望他。他於是把詩稿放在檯上站起來了，兩手反扣在背后，慢慢地向那兩個胖臉的方向踱去。「我要在主人還沒有進來之前向他說，」他想。一那雜誌……但他忽然一　地在屋子當中的圓掉前站住了，因爲從眼角梢他巳看見主人又出現在屋門口。他於是立刻弓着腰，帶着一種閒適的風度俯下臉去，把揩光亮了的鼻尖凑到圓掉當中瓶口的枯花叢中的一朶已經脫了瓣的紫紅色花朶上，鼻翼縮兩縮，悠然地說道：</p>
<p>「唔，唔，好香。」</p>
<p>主人站在他的面前，很抱歉地彎着腰皺着眉說道：</p>
<p>「呵，對不住得很，你看我簡直忙不過來，又要呌人去催客，文要……！唉唉，簡直失陪得很，簡直……」</p>
<p>「隨便吧，沒關係。」蒼白臉抬起臉來說。「這花倒……</p>
<p>「呵呵，」圓胖臉忽然站起來搶着說。「你看我們兩個只顧談，把尊貴的客人都冷在一邊了。主人，你有事就去弄你的吧，我們也可以幫你陪客的。大家都是自己人，對不對？」他說着，眼睛看了看蒼臉掃過來又望了望長胖臉。</p>
<p>「對，對。」其實我倒應該帮敝親陪陪客。長胖臉說，也一閃的端出自己背后的椅子來，伸出一隻手，五根胖指伸直，同時忽然搖頭唸了起來。「花徑—不曾—緣—客掃。蓬門—今始—爲—君開。」嗨嗨！請阿？」</p>
<p>主人皺一皺眉，從旁邊小心地屏着呼吸看了蒼白臉一眼。</p>
<p>「好吧，你有事就去吧。」蒼白臉微笑地說，耳根頭又紅了一紅。「不必太這麼拘泥形跡，都是自己人，沒關係……」</p>

<p>在「一片孤城萬仭山」的武川停下車來的時候，巳是下午四時了。陽光從東山的積雪反映過來，耀人眼目。車駛進了武川縣城，隨着飛揚塵土的汽車來的是不少的穿着藍布棉衣服的人，各個人臉上都現了希奇的眼光，低低的議論着我們從哪裏來；有些人竟低聲在說我們的華僑：『哦！還有洋鬼子呢！」說完，似乎怕我們的樣子，便又悄悄的溜開走了。接着補上來的又是一大批人，間或還有一兩個比較裝飾時髦的女人，用欣羡的眼光看我們的女孩子們。</p>
<p>汽車在驟政府門俞答下來，進去給歸化打了次電話，問和我們一同開出來的那兩倆汽車怎樣了？回答却說是。。「車壞了，巳經回來，明天再開出去！」得到了這樣的回答，只好惘惘然走出來。圍住我們汽車看的人越多了，像是在逛廟會：看一些他們眼中認爲五顏六色服裝的我們，女人們還不住對我們的女孩子們指指點點。</p>
<p>爲了等那兩輛汽車，我們是必須在這裏住一夜的。然而，在這小縣城裏：房屋是零零落落，破爛不堪，沒有大的店，哪裏去找這麼多的人的住處？好容易勉强找到了兩個地方：女孩子們住到一個女子小學校，男孩子們另外找了一個地方，我却僥倖的在這小城中找到一個做小學教員的朋友，在他那裏住了一晚。</p>
<p>和我們的同伴分別了，走到那爲了生活跑到這孤城中來和我一樣年靑的友人那裏：那是一個在坡上的男子小學校，煤油燈光在黑暗中閃爍，走進了屋中，便給一股嘔心的氣味衡了出來，我說不出這是一種什麼臭味來，只覺得要吐，那年青的朋友看見我的神氣，笑着對我說：「這是爐中炭發出來的味。這種炭在地下埋藏的年限少，還沒有完全變成炭，燒起來便有一種非常惡臭的味，不過賤倒是頂賤的，一塊錢可以買一千斤，貧窮的人家和公家都是燒這種炭的！」我問他：『這種炭燒起來，豈不要把人悶倒？」他卻笑着說：「這倒不要緊！如果那樣，我不是早巳沒命了嗎？這炭雖臭，却不悶人的！」我想到我的年靑的友人怎樣爲生活掙扎，離開了溫暖的家，做了一個　等一走後山的一人，（註一）和他對於這些苦狠能忍受的樣子，比較我在歸化城中過得稍微優裕的生活，我慚愧的沒有話說了。</p>
<p>喝水的時候，我又感覺着這水不但鹹的難喝，而且，還帶着一種臭味，可是想到剛才的事我便不做聲了。那朋友看我喝水時皺着眉，便說：「這水鹹的很不好喝吧？恐怕要比放一些！進去還難喝！這水是井水，是普通人們喝的，另外。有一種離城數里外的泉水，是和歸化城中的御泉井水（註二）一樣好喝的，但這却是有錢人才能買得起，才能喝到……」他說着似乎很感慨，我却爲他那種態度而驚異了。</p>
<p>在朋友那裏吃了晚飯，雖然很乏，却還想出去看看，便隨着那朋友到女學校看我們同行的女孩子去。</p>
<p>女孩子們三三兩兩手拉手在院中唱歌，黑暗中看去，聽着悠揚的歌聲，不禁使我想到這裏好像另一境地，似乎不是旅行荒凉的塞外了！</p>
<p>在女學較，同中年以上的校長談了幾句話：這城裏共有四千多人，女孩子上學的却只有二三十個，城中和鄉村中的人還恐怕女兒走進了學校便會被在戀愛着拐上走了，畢了業到歸化升學的也只有幾個人。</p>
<p>走回那朋友處睡覺的時候，夜幕深深垂下來，看我們的人早巳都回去了，只剩下了寂靜的街，狗吠聲不時的傳來，我聽着那友人告訴我前年『刮野鬼」（註三）的怎樣打進城中來的故事，我想到我認識的一個女子在那次變亂中怎樣被刮野鬼們蹂躪的事，設想着這時候有那麽多掮着槍，騎着馬的綠林英雄們……不禁害怕起來，鑽進了被中，很快地就睡熟了。</p>
<p>第二天，隨了我那個友人到一個小飯館裏「喝茶去」，經過了大街，穿進了一條小巷子裏去，在一家像山穴的飯館門前，走進去，炭的臭味衝得我要發暈，房間沒有糊項棚，士會不時的掉到我們底碗中來，坑上地下盡是勞苦的弄人，還有些小商人，在這裏消磨他們淸晨的光陰。</p>
<p>吃了幾個「燒麥」（註四）出去看我們的同伴騎馬，看駐在這裏的兵士盤槓子……從早晨起便又有許多人圍着看我們，直到上午十一點鐘，歸化的兩輛汽車才來了。</p>
<p>註一，高等「走後山的」意即在大靑山後謀生而職業較高者</p>
<p>註二，「御泉井」在歸化大召前，相傳淸康熙帝曾在此飲馬，在綏爲最甘泉水。</p>
<p>註三、「刮野鬼」係綏人稱土匪者，有時，匪亦自稱其為「刮野鬼」。</p>
<p>註四，「燒賣」係绥人特製之食物，類似豹子而皮極薄且較包子爲小，爲綏人早晨至飯館之唯一食品。</p>

<h3 id="c188">從日本的文化事業說到中國的文化建設 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>日本的文化事業，邇來頗形發達。他們不僅留心國內文化機關的建設，同時亦注意日本文化的向外宣揚。聞今年日本由國際文化事業費中所設立的國際文化課，施行以來，甚具成效。外務省於明年的預算內，巳列入一百八十五萬餘元，爲國際文化事業費。這項經費的分配，有的用於設置國際文化局，日本文化講座，日語敎授所，及日本研究所。有的則作爲內外學者與學生交換派遺費，日本藝術介紹費，國際競技費，國際文化振興費，及各種國際文化團體費。這足見日本注重文化事業的一斑。尤其宣揚日本文化於國外，他們更具十分的熱心。</p>
<p>一國的强弱，可由文化程度的高低作判斷。今日西方幾個國家之所以稱雄於世，爲因他們的文化比別人發達。維新後的日本，也跟本國文化的進步，一天輿盛一天。他們現時雖一味致力於軍備的充實，然對於各種文化事業的創設，進行仍不稍懈。蓋他們明白文化事業關係於國家的發展，至爲重大。</p>
<p>我國爲世界一古文明國家，我們的文化，曾在歷史上吐過萬丈的光芒。然這是屬於已往的。現在的中國文化，與西方各文明國相較，至少已落後一二世紀。我們說這句話，並不欲長他人志氣，滅自己威風。因為事實原是如此，叫我們無法隱諱。除非是搬出一些精神文明來誇耀，若物質文化，我們簡直一無所有。一次水災就淹死千百萬人，這雖是天災，但物質建設的缺乏，可以想見。至我們所常向人誇耀的精神文明，又是什麽東西呢？卽使是至實吧，恐怕亦已不適於現代中國人的生活。</p>
<p>考今日我國文化退步的原因，最主要的，便是我國人一向總不願意接受西方的物質文明。一般人往往抱有一種成見，以爲物質文明是卑劣的，只有精神文明才值得我們崇奉。殊不知所謂文化，應是包括物質的與精神的，二者缺一不可。所以將來欲望中國文化的發達，充分輸入西方的物質文明，是很急切而且很需要的。</p>
<p>近日我國文化建設之聲，高唱一時。綜觀各方的意見，有主張全盤歐化的，有主張中體西用的，有主張以中國爲本位的。以我們看來，今後中國的文化建設，無論取那一個方向，接受西方的物質文明，當是一個必須做到的最重要的工作。捨此而不由，中國文化再努力五百年，仍然要跟在別人的後面走。至、利用怎樣的方法去接受西方的物質文明呢質那只有孫中山先生所說的迎頭趕上去的一法。</p>
<p>以上所述，是關於我國的文化建設方面。若宣揚固有文化於國外，中國文化也自有其一二可取的特點，值得我們提出來向人介紹，使外人認識中國的眞面目。這工作我們雖不能像日本那樣積極的進行，却亦須加以相當的注意。不然則外國人所想像的中國人，恐怕永遠是一種帶辮子纏小足的未開化民族呢。</p>
<h3 id="c189">台城散記 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— 艾荼</p>
<p>用華僑底血汗重重疊疊的構造成的台山城，一個華麗的小小的市塲，這兒有偉大的建築物，有鉅大的百貨公司，有煌耀的銀行，有秀麗的學校，有奢華的脂粉底香氣，一切的，都是新興的小都市裏所有的資本主義的塲面。</p>
<p>許多年以前，華僑還未曾怎麽發展的時候，這兒確還是個古舊的市塲。到了後來，華僑一天一天的在外國發展了以後，以華僑匯欵最豐厚的廣東，而尤其是以台山的人們最發達的，所以，這兒的人們眞可以說是足遍天下，不錯，這兒的華僑的資本勢力也可以說是佔了全國的大都會的重要的地位。比方拿上海香港廣州等地方的情形來說吧，總是以台山的商人們佔了第一把高椅的。所以，當我們到那兒去的時候，總可以看得見那兒許多許多用華僑的資本組構成的各種事跡。</p>
<p>這兒的火車路從北方的江門公益到這兒來，再由這兒到南方的廣海，四通八達的汽車路好像網一樣的穿通着。還有一條很方便的小河，可以從海外運載着許多貨物到這偉大的消費商塲來的。整天的，我們可以在小小的城市裏聽到不停的火車的轟隆聲，或汽笛的吵鬧聲，那華麗的汽車迅速地在平坦而齊整的士敏土的馬路上飛也似的來來去去，實在，整個台城的馬路是全廣東的縣分最好的。那兩排很齊整的洋房和商店跟大都市的繁華的街頭沒有兩樣的。在那七八層高的樓子底下站立着的時侯，也許你會疑問這兒是大都會裏的一角吧。</p>
<p>每逢一個墟期的時侯，這兒特別的囂張了起來，那從四鄉進城來的人們，大都是樸實的婦人們。不過，假如是年靑的呢，她們總是打扮得那感動人的，染滿了脂粉的香氣地在街頭流盪。在城，裏的靜寂的一角，那兒大都是靑年男女們的出入的塲所。在台城，我們可以看見許多許多穿得花枝似的女郎跟漂亮的洋裝的男子在一塊兒的。這一切都已成爲台城的特別與盛的現象。那奢華的資本主義的濃厚底氣息，至少是我不能够否認的吧。就是那高昂而偉美的建築物，也足以配得出這裏是南方很有名的市塲，而且是消費的市塲。不過，直到近來海外失業華僑們一帮一帮的歸來以後，華僑停止了匯欵。於是，這兒的一切不能避免的影響，就漸漸地起了頹唐和冷靜的景象。一切的都戴上了悲哀的面幕了。而街上，每個地方就高掛着「大减價」的招牌，在風中飄揚着。跟大都會不兩樣的，那一般的人們底感覺也是「若無其事的冷淡下來了。</p>
<p>從火車站到台城的街道上慢步着的時候，我們還可以看得到那一些天買活潑的孩子們在跳着的走來走去的。那是台山的敎育發展的好果。不過，近年來，因爲華僑失業和停止匯欵的結果。敎育方面也很顯明地受了影響和破產，十四五間中等學校的學生人數也大大地减少了。也同時的，一般從外國留學歸來的或者是從國內的大學讀完書歸來的靑年，就好像沙一樣的散佈在鄉村裏。因此，「僧多粥少」的敎職也就明爭暗奪的，弄得一塌糊塗了。</p>
<p>從城的東南角拐了一個灣，外面就是最有名的中學校，那一座華麗的校舍是用華僑的血汗六十多萬元建築成的。所以，這樣的校舍，總算是很了不起的。不過，裏面的成績，聽說很壞，那也是中國社會的必然的現象吧。</p>
<p>從這兒坐了火車向南邊走，可以直達到南海之濱，再飄出這海面就是在濤的南太平洋了。</p>
<h3 id="c190">太陽的話 <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 吉彖</p>
<p>在孩子的時候，在臉上依然未消失童年的笑的時侯，我記得，我是多麽地愛着這靑蛇一般柔媚的夜哪！是的，那無邊的靜寂的夜之聲息，像沒有風浪的平靜的海；那山泉水一樣的夜月的光流，從遠處，從河山的那一邊，帶來了說不盡的無言的慰藉與低迴；還有！呀，那永遠是年靑的（也許是沒有衰老的時候的）燈光與歡笑，烈味的人生享樂，烈味的烟草與酒，這些彷彿全在夜的黑版上標上了碩大的字句與感嘆號：「夜，同了她底淫蕩，腐斕與享樂，她是屬於年靑人的，永遠是屬於年靑人的啊。」</p>
<p>（該死！難道說在這困苦凋殘的年頭，年靑人被允許有的，就祗是這一串痲木與迷醉嗎？難道這對於某種人是有「利」的嗎？難道……？）</p>
<p>夜！帶着她底奇怪的僻性與姿態，帶着她底靑紅色的外衣與笑，就是這樣地存在在我底淺淺的孩子的時代中的，在生活依然還沒有成爲苦惱的問題的時侯，在年靑的臉上還留着明朗的笑之痕跡的時候……</p>
<p>可是一年一年地，在不算十分輕快的生活中掙扎着，學習若過來，消失了童年的夢興歡笑，心頭是朝夕被另一種謎樣的難題所盤據着。童年的心一天天地在蒼老起來，且叫我忘記了一切鍍着偽質的金黃色的時日了。</p>
<p>（夜是依然殘留在心頭的，那麼長，那麽沈沈地看不到蘇醒的消息啊！她，也許已經不再有嬌媚的外貌，而却是和生活一樣的，帶起陰慘的面貌，帶起永遠是烏沈沈的心來了。）</p>
<p>那樣地，我是忘記了病態的昏暗的享樂的；可是，對於白天，因爲在這兒收容着許多與理想全然不同的生活的醜惡面，欺騙，愚弄，與所有的人的舊惱；而且，最叫人受不住的是，在那兒點着一個大的，耀眼的太陽！</p>
<p>光亮得刺痛人底視覺，叫人不敢直對着它張開眼睛來的，炎熱得炙痛人底皮膚，也會晒昏人底腦子的。是太陽，它把夜間的鍍金的生活照出了發銹的銅的眞狀，這些，多够叫人不愉快，多够</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>叫人害怕而討厭呢。</p>
<p>可是最後，終於在一個料想不到的日子，我在另一種光態裏，看到太陽的寳貴了。</p>
<p>一個早上——絕早的晨間啊。四週依然是寂靜的，聽不見人間的嘈雜；樹上，鳥兒稀落地在叫，殘星依在在閃，而我，彷彿走完了一程悠長的路途似地，忽忙地從夢中醒來了。</p>
<p>冒着朝氣，我靜靜地走向郊外去；是初秋的天氣了，露珠晶亮地在草上閃動，風是溫和的，且溶解了泥土與植物的氣息。</p>
<p>太陽——這太陽啊！巳經默點地掛起了看着它，是容易想起屠格涅夫底「早晨」的詩篇的；它曠大地把光亮舖在地上，依舊是那麽耀眼，那麽的炎熱。</p>
<p>漸漸地，習慣了它，便開始覺得可親起來了：看着它底臉：嚴肅，熱誠，是眞正的金黃的；晒着它，像沈浸在埃及的溫泉水裏，溫煖而堅定，在這兒，陰暗與冷漠是不存在的！</p>
<p>於是，開始學着去利用它，讓它披在我底全身，不怕，也不着慌地，試了一次日光浴，醫生是勸過我的：「在療養上，日光是無代價的劑啊。</p>
<p>於是我想到：在日常的多接近太陽光的生活情之下，身體也許會變好一點起來的，皮膚也許不再會那麼蒼白而鬆浮的，一切健康上的欠缺也許會漸漸消失去的吧？</p>
<p>一陣精神上的舒適叫人感謝得說不出話，祗是威到：能永久地有着太陽，便是人世間的最大的幸福了。</p>
<p>從這時侯起，我才開始覺得太陽的可貴，而認識了黑夜的陰慘與作偽。</p>
<h3 id="c191">沈先生 <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— 施瑛</p>
<p>悠久的歲月，坎坷的生活，將沈先生的性格，磨礪得跟孩子一樣了。六十多歲的年紀，每天每天，跟全在十歲上下的孩子拌在一起。眼淚，鼻涕，戒尺，捲角的書本，喧嘩的誦讀。沈先生望着這一羣二三十個磕頭擺尾的孩子，猶如一簇嚶嚶地在腐肉上的金蒼蠅，他自己郤悠然旁觀，帶着滿足的微笑。</p>
<p>一個孩子，在以曼長的音調念唐詩：「少小離家老大回，鄉音無改鬢毛催。兒童相見不相識，笑問客從何處來。」沈先生最愛這一首詩，他神往地聽着，手指輕輕地敲着桌面，當作節拍。每當他聽到念這首詩，他總情不自禁，在他老年枯寂的心懷中，悄悄地憶起他的少小時節，庭中的秋陽，抹着葵花纖瘦的淡影，輕輕地在粉牆上顫動，一方的靑空上，悠悠地流過柔和的白雲。彷彿還是暮春時節呢。……他的靑春，全在書本和考籃中過去的。一個秀才的銜頭，是他寒窗十年的代價，他生在世代書香的家庭裏，在這小鎮上，念書的人很少，他的父親是舉人和紳董，田產的收入，很彀一家的溫飽。那時的沈先生，是無憂無慮的時代，雖然他念的全是八股文和試帖詩，可是他也陶醉在『書中自有顏如玉」的狀况中。春秋佳日的下午，拿了一卷詩，在沿江的望海茶樓上，泡了一壺茶，一邊吟味書中的句子，一邊欣賞江頭的帆影。他也不用做什麼事，沈先生自己的將來，便是他父親的現在。中了舉人，便是地方上的紳董，衣食無虞，何苦孜孜地營生呢？在他，夢是美滿的。可是時代的潮流，捲去他最後的希望。接着父親的去世，增加了他的傷心，但是最叫他傷心的，他得睜開眼睛，看生活的担子，怎樣加到他文弱的肩上來。那時他已過了三十歲，是三個孩子的父親了。</p>
<p>蒙了親戚的推薦，他成了一家店舖中的司賬。算盤，銀錢，賬簿，他平常總不注意這些東西，現在郤變了他親切的伴侶。中年的心情，加上累贅的家庭，生活已不會再起甚麽波浪，可是從來不曾經騐過的商店生活，使他的性情變得遲鈍了，也跟一隻拖着重犁的跛牛一樣，蹒跚地經過了二十年。—二十年，又是這長長的時間！人也老了，家庭的子女也長成了。自己的嘴上，蓋着花白的鬍鬚，郤蓋不住憂鬱的微笑。但是當他憂鬱的微笑還沒有從嘴角消去時，他司賬的那家店舖關了門，他從此失業了。自然整整三年，再也找不到地方。—在他老年的心裏，以爲像他那樣的年紀可以在家享福了，可是長成的兒子，賺的錢還不彀自立，他祇好重溫舊夢，開起蒙館來，招到二三十個瘦弱的孩子，一方面自己可以得到一點零用錢，一方面也可以消遺無聊的歲月。在孩子們曼聲朗誦時，她性往抽起」枝紙烟，望着裊裊的白烟，懷想着無踪無影的往事。他也不知道還是懊悔，還是追念。……</p>
<p>放走了蒙館的孩子，沈先生也拖着衰邁的脚步，到外面去走走。可是他再也沒有心情上望海茶樓去。這經過三四十年星霜的老店，倒依然如故地仍在呢。</p>
<h3 id="c192">海濱 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 村因</p>
<p>（藍色的海，紅色的海，笑着的海，吼着的海。）</p>
<p>在早晨？蹓躂在海岸邊，一種曠恰的實感，像米飯一樣地塞住了我的肚子；簡直使我飽滿了，而那無限的淸鮮，原是無限地，無限地。</p>
<p>早晨的太陽，是像一個年靑的少女那樣美麗的，它的溫柔，要是我的手能够去撫摸到，那末，我會這樣說；「眞像天鵝絨般的溫柔呵！」而那滾滾的海水，比太陽，比天鵝絨，還要臻美。它有時是舞着，有時呢，却麗麗拉拉地哼起那似哀愁似輕鬆的Picnic　式的調子來了。</p>
<p>（我喜歡聆聽那偶然飛來的，會刺戟我的神經的吼聲。）</p>
<p>可是在中午，太陽的臉兒鐵一般地繃起了。</p>
<p>（我不聽見什麽纖妙的自然的音樂，我不看見什麽動心的自然的舞蹈。我吓，我祗知道海是睡熟了。）</p>
<p>睡在這暴情的太陽下的溫柔的海，正好像一頭快要屠殺的牛兒那麽地可憐。但是，誰能去請這暴情的太陽變得和着些呢？</p>
<p>那海濱呵，眞可憐！似乎正在向我訴說：</p>
<p>『這日子眞難過！」</p>
<p>爲了海的苦難吧，我也苦難起來了。只得閉上了眼，靜心地想趕快睡去。聽着那烘熱的海風懶懶地在爬着，爬過我的身子時，似乎一千萬重的苦疼全屬於我了。</p>
<p>（藍色的海，紅色的海，笑着的海，吼着的海。）</p>
<p>一到傍晚，漁夫們打着漿，遙遙地回來了。他們飲的是海的血，捉的是海的細胞呵。</p>
<p>（早暮望着海濱的，是那聳起着的淡色的山峯。數着一二三四……打這兒走到那兒，至少要使你記不淸你的步子的數目。可是，站在海濱向後面一眺呵，不消幾秒鐘，你立刻可以看到那淡色的山峯。它是熱烈地安慰着這海濱，它像一個剛才懂事的少男，正向着這美麗的少女在調情呢。而它們間的情感熱烈得不能再熱烈下去時，山峯要冒出烟來了，山峯要將它自己的小小的靈魂付給這柔情的少女—於是，住在那兒的人們，都遭着恐慌了。當他們在擾亂中時，那山峯的靈魂與海濱甜密的倫吻起來。擁抱起來了。</p>
<p>月亮出來了。海濱的溫柔，頓時忘記了那中午時的苦疼。</p>
<p>男人，女人，像櫻花節一樣的熱鬧，有的拖着帆布椅子，置着小圓桌，用他們的啤酒。</p>
<p>不過，那邊漁夫們提了明亮的燈，嘴里嚼着晚飯時的餘屑，又要跨上那腥味的漁船上去工作了。</p>
<p>游浴在海水里，及在海濱上喝啤酒的人們，都沒有注意到這些渺小的漁夫們的操勞，他們對於不是自身的苦惱是漠不關心的！</p>
<p>是的，海濱給月色調和得極度的幽美了。可是，少女般的海，却醒悟了，它怒吼了。——</p>

<p>— （明天）</p>
<p>（一）大家都知道葉淺予是一位全國馳名的漫畫家，却不知道他老早就是下海的電影圈內人了，他把王先生畫在紙上，現在又把他搬上了銀幕，我們想到使人一見就要打哈哈的滑稽王先生的創造者，一定是位有王先生一樣風度的幽默人物吧，假若你要那樣想，那你就完全錯了，他的外表是短小精幹，性情是誠摯和藐，十足的藝術家的風度，可是他現在是新時代公司的經理，你們一定以爲藝術家是不會辦理事務吧，其實這又是一個錯誤，他不但會辦一切事務，而且辦得很好，你們看新時代公司日見發展，這就是就是他辦事的成績。</p>
<p>（二）湯傑這個名字該不是生疏的，可是他現在不姓湯而姓王了，他爲什麽姓王，這恐怕只有葉淺予才會知道，假若讀者要問我湯傑是個什麽樣兒，那我就要請你們去看葉淺予的漫畫王先生，若果還嫌不甚淸楚，那麽你們去看銀幕上的王先生吧。你們在銀幕上可以很淸楚地看到湯傑的眞面目，而且也可以發現他爲什麼姓王的理由，近來他從蘇州回來可有些改樣了，胡蝶女士第一個見着他很驚異的問「王先生怎麽又黑又瘦？「湯傑不禁長嘆一聲說。」我近來到農村去了一趟，農村破產，農民陷於水深火熱之中，我這又黑又瘦，不過是到農村帶回來的民間疾苦萬分之一，全部農村破產可憐亦復可笑的圖畫，你等我把內景拍完時你再瞧吧。」胡女士聽了，不禁黯然者久之。</p>
<p>（三）曹雪松我們只知他是一個文學家，不知什麼時候起他竟然作了小丑，據他自己說他有他做小丑的哲學，自然這年頭自己笑笑使人家也笑笑，這是難能而又可貴的事，他的外號呌小陳，可是小陳並不小，看過王先生的影片就知道他的樣兒了，他這次　蘇州去並沒有拍戲就返來了，他對人說「到蘇州去雖沒有在鏡頭，前面做戲，但是人生的戲倒做得很精彩呢。」說完後就是一陣得意的微笑，這笑裏面隱藏了不少的神秘，</p>
<p>（四）江明這個名字在四五年前是人們很熱習的，此後就有長時間的隔閡，據說他不幸生過肺病，在醫院裏整整睡過三年，現在他是恢復健康，我們很希望能再看見他在舞台上的豐姿，但是他近來也改行了，他在新時代公司任編劇，王先生影片受到廣大的歡迎，雖然從沒有一個觀衆會注意到這位幕後的無名英雄，但是他　這幕後的工作是有特別濃厚興趣的，這次到蘇州去他自己說他做了一位忠實的人生戲劇的觀衆，因此曹雪松的神秘是不敢在他的面前賣弄，他是一切都觀得明白，彩雲橋眸的月色，綠蔭夾道中的馬車……據他自己說，他將寫一篇「蘇州的馬車」的故事，不知道這馬車上載的是些什麼，我們等瞧吧。（待續）</p>

<p>— （影呆）</p>
<p>中價汽車突見活躍</p>
<p>美國的汽車事業，在史跡上，我們如果觀察一下，那麽產銷的數字，無疑，可算是一九二九年度最高了，自一九三〇年起，不景氣的浪潮，開始攪盪起來，整個的美國，到處是充滿了不景氣象，所有的工商業，十九受其影響，汽車業當然也不致例外，要受到相當的影響呢。</p>
<p>因此，自不景氣開始而後，美國各汽車廠，產車的數量，突然低落起來，我們回想到一九二九年時，汽車業全盛的時代，那一年美國各汽車廠總共產車五·六二二·〇〇〇輛，此後一九三〇年减至三·五一〇·〇〇〇輛，一九三一年二·四七二·〇〇〇輛，一九三二年一·四三一·〇〇〇輛，一九三三年一·九八六·〇〇〇輛，一九三四年二·八九六·〇〇〇輛，由數字上我們可以看到自一九三〇年起，美國的汽車產量，逐年低减下來，而一九三二年的產量，要算最低，僅及一九二九年四分之一，一九三三年起又增加了，但和一九二九年相較，還是相去很遠呢。</p>
<p>爲了一九三三年的產量，比一九三二年增加了，一九三四年比一九三三年更高，於是美國汽車界的各廠領袖，便樂觀起來，以爲美國汽車業復興的時期已至，於是當一九三四年年底，各車廠在一九三五年營業計劃上，都增加產量，在他們的企圖之中，以爲一九三五年度的全美汽車產量，至少可有四百萬，一九三五年度開始，新車的銷數，固然突見活躍，第一季的產銷數字，達一百萬輛以上，上半年的產銷情形，確實統計，雖然尙未正式發表，但在二百萬輛以上是可以斷言的，因此，全年產車四百萬輛，這個目標，容許可以到達的，莫怪美國的汽車夫要興奮起來呀。</p>
<p>美國各廠所產的汽車，我們如果在售價上分一個等級，那麽可以分出高價，中價，和低價三種，照過去的情形，低價汽車，銷數最多，中價次之，高價最少，這當然是不易的定理，不過一九二九年後，連得在百分比率的上面，低價汽車也逐年增高，中價和高價逐年跌落，個中唯一的原因，就在爲了在不景氣怒潮之下，美國一般國民的經濟力量是薄弱了，無力購買中價以上的汽車，同時，汽車製造工程的進步，使低價汽車的穩快安全，和高價車無分軒輊，那麼如果要買高價車，又何樂而不買價廣物美的低價汽車呢，基於上述兩種原由上面，低價車的銷數，便幾乎把中價，高價兩種汽車的市塲奪去了。</p>
<p>可是事情竟有出人意外的，本年度開始而後，中價汽車的銷數，在百分比上突然增高起來，於是一般汽車界人，爲了中價汽車的活躍，對於車業復興的信念益堅了，所有汽車廠領袖人物，都說在這種情形之下，汽車業巳有普遍復興的可能了，我們回想起來，一九三三和一九三四兩年，美國各廠汽車產數的增加，都是爲了低價汽車銷數好轉，在百分比率中，低價汽車逐年增高，反之，中價以上汽車，逐年低落，因此，這年頭各車廠對於低價汽車，仍舊全力注意，那知結果在百分比上，却是售價自六百五十至八百五十美元的中價汽車銷數增加得最多。</p>
<p>在本年的最初四個月內，通用的寳塔克和奧斯摩鼻爾，克雷斯勒的道奇，在全美各地註冊數上總共有一四八·三一五輛之多，比較去年同時期增加百分之一一〇·七，而客車的銷數，僅增百分之六〇·八，在五六兩個月中，中價汽車的銷數，和最初四個月內一樣，繼績在增加之中，據克雷斯勒車廠六月十五日報告，最後一星期中，道奇的銷數，總共四·二六五輛，比前一個星期增加百分之五·四，本年度在二十四個星期之中，六月十五日爲止，一共銷去九〇·四〇六輛，比上年度同時期增加百分之九七·四。</p>
<p>最初四個月中，在美國，全國汽車註冊數中，低價汽車總共六五二·三五三輛，或是可該在銷車總數中佔百分之七三·四，以數量說來，比去年同時期增加百分之五七，但上年度最初四個月，低價車的百分比率，佔百分之七五。二呢，因此，汽車界人，都說中價汽車的銷數激增，事實已證明社會方面，已有較多的錢來購買汽車，一般有資格買高價汽車的人，不景氣開始而後，購買低價汽車的，現在又回複到原來的情狀，要購買格價高些的汽車了。</p>

<p>— 虞</p>
<p>英國車輛肇禍統計一九三五年開首的六個月中，大不列顚的道路車輛肇禍計共一五，〇〇〇起據運輸部的分析，受害的人中間以馬路上的行人爲最多，駕車的最少，如果拿百分法來計算，那末行人佔五五·九，騎脚踏車人二〇·二，騎機器脚踏車人一二·九，乘車人六，二，駕駛人四·八，再從分析中加以統計，路人中百分之八五·一因爲自不小心而致死，其中百分之三〇·二都是孩子，年紀還不滿十五歲，從這兩點上看起來，這是很公平的意見同，就是駕乘汽車的大衆，差不多在駕車上是很小心的，年輕的孩子們，對於馬路上的車輛來往，最不經心，一切交通上的知識也最淺薄，因之家長與學校當局都應該注意這件事，在另一方面，車夫的駕駛上錯誤，所佔的成數還很大，計爲百分之二五·一，而肇禍事件中以速率過大爲最大主因，最稱稀奇的，就是每天肇禍發生的時間，總以下午五時至七時之間爲最多，據推斷它的原因，一定因爲成年人在這時候，急於從公事房回家去休息，所以車行的速率高增，而肇禍失事事件不難隨之而起，至於在早晨呢，大家好像懶洋洋地不願上辦事處去，因之車行中度，較之安全。</p>
<p>裁撤美聯邦汽油稅　美國的汽油抽稅，差不多是要經過兩重，在州稅之外，還有聯邦的國稅，汽車駕用人因爲負擔過大，最近要求將聯邦稅裁撤，參加這撤稅運動的計有三百個團體，代表二十一州，據統計所得，如果這個稅得以除去，那末至少可節省納稅人·每年少費美金一七〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，這是在州稅美金五〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，和註冊費美金三五〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元外的駢枝，單就紐約一州來說，就要每年多付美金一三，八〇〇，〇〇〇元。</p>
<p>百人中一人必受傷美國因爲汽車事業頂發達，常年的汽車失事率也最高，照最近出版的「公共安全」雜誌所統計，在去年一年中，美國人在一百人中間必有一個人，因汽車肇禍而受傷，這個統計是根據了去年的肇禍計數而算出來的，去年美國因汽車失事而受傷的人，計共一，二五〇，〇〇〇人，而美國的人口約爲一二五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇人，適爲一與一百之比，「公共安全」雜誌又根據了這個比例，告訴大衆說，「照了上面的計數推算起來，現在如果有兩個活着的人，在今後的五十年中一個人勢必有受傷的可能，四個人中的一個人，在二十五年中有受傷的可能，五個人中的一個人，在今後的二十年中有受傷的危險，如果一個人有近親朋友二十人，這樣子如非大家都在馬路上十分留意，那末在今後的五年中，這二十人中定有一個人，爲汽車肇禍而受傷，或竟喪失生命呢。</p>

<p>當去年一九三四年中。外國的成品汽車·底盤·車胎等的輸日本總額價值爲日金四一，一九三，三二四元。比較一九三〇年的日金二二，二七五，九三七元的輸入，已增加到一倍以上了。</p>
<p>這個輸入額的年有增加。尙屬一九二五年以來的事。一九三二年的提高關稅壁壘後。業界輸入的數量上雖大受打擊。但因匯兌率的跌落。日本的汽車輸入。在價值方面。始終沒有减低的。</p>
<p>因爲軍火工業的進展。一九三四年的汽車業。不論數量與價值二方。均有可驚的增加。參看下表。卽可見其大概。</p>
<p>成品汽車的輸入</p>
<p>一九三四年　一九三三年</p>
<p>數量八九六輛　四九一輛</p>
<p>價三，三五七，　一，八六四，</p>

<p>數量九五〇架　七八〇架</p>
<p>價一，一六七，　一，一一五</p>

<p>以上總值四一，一　二二，一七五</p>
<p>九三，三二四日元　，九三七日元</p>
<p>舶來品汽車的輸入雖然激增。但一方面國產自造的汽車事亦非常活躍。顯然呈着可驚的進步。日產自動車會社當推爲業界之冠。該會社當一九三一年時一年間。祗造成汽車四百三十四輛。以後年有進步。一九三二年產出八百四十輛。一九三三年有一千七百九十輛。至去年一九三四年。竟增至二千五百輛。預料至年底的統計。必能較此數尙須增加兩倍以上。去年十月間。日本輸入澳洲的大批小型「Datsun」牌乘客汽車。一切出口手續。都由三菱商事會社。一手經理。</p>
<p>據云日本實業會社。卽製造前述「Datsun」汽車者。巳成爲日本著名大工業之一。巳决增厚資本至二〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇日元。實收九九，四一五，〇〇〇元云。</p>
<p>日產自動車會社並聯合業界日本自動車會社等。組織公司籌集大量資本專供業界貸欵押欵及生產事業之用。</p>
<p>上圖爲錫滬公路上首次遇險之順風牌純鋼汽車。車爲某君自備。係由車夫駕駛。當時因速度過高。失却駕馭能力。以致突然駛至路側。經兩次翻滾。而由深七尺闊廿尺水溝之一面。直衝至溝之對面田中。方始停止。彼時車頭正對路上。車身並未翻倒。車中諸人。內有少婦一人。懷抱小孩。雖皆飽受虛驚。但均未受傷。卽車上玻璃。亦未震碎。事後諸人深自慶幸。並皆以爲此次生命無碍。實應歸功於順風牌純鋼汽車云。</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Premier Wang's resignation may be brought up for discussion again at the Central Political Council on the morning of the 21st. Standing Committee members Ye Chucang, Sun Ke, Ju Zheng, and Central Committee members Kong Xiangxi, Chu Minyi, Dai Chuanxian, etc., held an unofficial meeting in the conference room of the Central Political Council at 4 p.m. on the 20th, exchanging opinions with each other. They dispersed around 5 p.m. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 20th).</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Huang Fu arrived in Nanjing on the evening of the 19th from Moganshan by car along the Nanjing-Hangzhou National Highway. He met with Chairman Chiang at 8 a.m. on the 20th and made a report. The date when Huang will take office as Minister of Interior has not yet been decided. (Special dispatch from the 20th).</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Huang Fu came to Nanjing by car from Moganshan on the morning of the 19th and arrived at 5 p.m. He immediately returned to his private residence to rest. He went to the Military Affairs Commission at 8 a.m. on the 20th to meet with Chairman Chiang and discuss matters. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 20th).</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chu Minyi arrived in Nanjing by train from Shanghai at 7 a.m. on the 20th. According to him, Premier Wang arrived in Shanghai on the 19th and entered a hospital for a physical examination. Because his illness has not been cured, his intention to resign has not been dispelled. If the Central Government allows him to resign from his position in the Executive Yuan, he can come to Nanjing to serve the Central Government. Before his resignation is approved, he does not intend to come to Nanjing for the time being. The location and time of the meeting between Chiang and Wang have been requested by Wang via telegram to Chiang for arrangement. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 20th).</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Kong Xiangxi said that after Premier Wang arrived in Shanghai from Qingdao on the 19th, he immediately sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang, requesting that a meeting location and time be arranged. He also stated that because of illness, he earnestly pleaded for resignation. Chairman Chiang has already replied to Wang by telegram, asking him to come to Nanjing. Whether Wang will come immediately, or meet with Chiang at another location before coming to Nanjing, I am not aware of the details. (Special dispatch from the 20th).</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Chu Minyi arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 20th. He then went with Chairman of Hubei Province Zhang Qun to meet with Chairman Chiang and presented Premier Wang's handwritten letter. (Special dispatch from the 20th).</p>

<h3 id="e2">Premier Wang May Arrive in Nanjing This Morning <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After Premier Wang submitted his resignation, which was repeatedly dissuaded by the Central Government and Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang, it is said that he may resume his duties immediately, while others say that his intention to resign is still difficult to dispel. The truth is unclear, and there are various rumors. According to news from political circles today, although Wang is expressing his intention to decline, all parties have decided to unanimously persuade Wang to resume his post as Premier and concurrently as Foreign Minister. It is expected that this will be realized after Chiang and Wang meet. There was originally talk of Wang returning to Nanjing on the 20th, and Nanjing would send a Ford plane to Shanghai to welcome him. Various dignitaries in Nanjing had also made welcoming preparations. However, Wang was unable to leave Shanghai temporarily due to some matter. It is now reported that Wang may arrive in Nanjing on the morning of the 21st. If he still does not come, Chiang and Wang will arrange to meet elsewhere. The heads of various departments of the Executive Yuan have now decided that if Wang still cannot dispel his intention to resign, they will submit a general resignation to show their firm intention to persuade him to stay.

On the morning of the 20th, he also received various central dignitaries and discussed the situation of suppressing bandits and the facilities of central government affairs. Chiang is scheduled to attend the Central Political Council on the morning of the 21st and will stay in Nanjing for a while. (Special dispatch from the 20th).</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Kong Xiangxi returned to Nanjing on the morning of the 20th and talked about his inspection of the flood situation, saying that he felt that the flood disaster was extremely serious, so he set out with officials on the 14th to inspect and seek relief. The water level is now dropping sharply and should not rise again. According to reports from Fu Rulin and the Chairman of Anhui, the water level between Nanjing and Xunyang has fallen by four to nine centimeters, and it is becoming more stable. In Anhui and Jiangxi, the dykes that breached include Guangchengwei, Baizhang Guanzhuangwei, and Mahua Di, etc. The area of ​​farmland affected along the river is estimated to be tens of thousands of acres. Many civilian dykes in Poyang Lake have been breached, and the disaster area is also extensive. As for the Jiqi Gongtongren Agong Dikes, they were extremely dangerous at the time, but fortunately, they were rescued. The water level rose sharply this year. When the water level in the 20th year was as high as this year, the dikes had already been broken in nineteen out of ten cases. Those that have been maintained this year are due to the emphasis on repairing dikes after the 20th year and the efforts of the provinces in flood prevention. When he arrived in Xunyang on the morning of the 16th, he immediately went ashore to inspect. The water disaster, agricultural disaster, and commercial difficulties were extremely tragic. Fortunately, the Central Government allocated funds to build dikes, which provided some peace. In the afternoon, he went to pay respects to Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang to report on the political situation and the disaster situation in various provinces. Zhang Yuejun and Xiong Shihui also paid respects to Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang. They discussed the relief measures in detail. Afterwards, due to time constraints and rain obstacles, he was unable to inspect the upstream. He also received a report from the Economic Commission's plane surveying the disaster, stating that the water in the breaches had receded and the dikes were being repaired, and all were out of danger. Now, because the flood victims along the rivers and lakes are in urgent need of relief and the political affairs of the Executive Yuan need to be handled urgently, he has returned to Nanjing to preside over them. He has instructed the relevant authorities to discuss and proceed with how to plan relief for the various disaster areas. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 20th).</p>

<p>(Beiping) On August 15th, the Japanese newspaper Jingjin Ribiri News carried a news item stating, "Recently, there is a military organization calling itself the Patriotic Volunteer Youth League, which has been centered in North China since February, and has extended to Manchuria to carry out various anti-Japanese 'Manchu' activities. Currently, the League has sent several senior propaganda committee members to recruit soldiers in the Beiping and Tianjin area. Their method of recruitment is to commission a lieutenant for those who lead 20 patriotic youths to join, a captain for those who lead 50, a major for those who lead 100, a lieutenant colonel for those who lead 300, and a military commander for those who lead 500, using such attractive bait to entice frustrated military and political figures... What is even more noteworthy is that the Beiping Military Affairs Branch Committee has been issuing funds for the purchase of weapons to the Patriotic League, spending 40,000 to 60,000 yuan per month since February. What the content is and where they will start their activities in the future is attracting attention from all parties." Yesterday, when inquired, the spokesperson of the Beiping Military Affairs Branch Committee said that the Military Affairs Branch Committee is currently working hard to promote friendly relations with the intention of the Central Government on good neighborliness in Sino-Japanese relations. At this time, there cannot be such an unconscious move. Moreover, all illegal groups in the Beiping and Tianjin area have long been strictly ordered by the authorities to ban and stop activities. How can one listen to some unscrupulous people secretly forming societies? The inaccuracy of this news is obvious to everyone. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 20th).</p>

<h3 id="e22">Shanghai Telephone Rate Increase Issue <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— Ang</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Company, in accordance with the business franchise contract signed with the Shanghai Public Concession and French Concession Municipal Council on August 5, 1930, requested to increase prices starting from April 1st of this year, so that the company could enjoy a net profit of 8.2% on its investment. This request was initiated in January of this year. The Municipal Council initially agreed, but due to the unanimous opposition from various commercial sectors, the Municipal Council also felt it was difficult to go against public opinion. The telephone rate increase matter thus reached a stalemate. It was not until the annual ratepayers' meeting of Westerners passed a resolution requesting the Municipal Council Board of Directors to negotiate with the telephone company to postpone the rate increase and suggesting the formation of a special committee, appointing one or more experts to review the rate increase matters. Based on this resolution, the Municipal Council repeatedly negotiated with the telephone company and finally decided to temporarily increase all rates by 11%, while referring the subsequent rate increase issues to the special committee for review and further discussion.</p>
<p>The telephone expert originally hired by the Municipal Council was only one British national. Later, due to the strong contention from both Chinese and Japanese parties, two seats for Chinese and Japanese experts were added. The telephone company, on the other hand, argued that since the company was an American enterprise, an American expert should also be hired. The Municipal Council also complied with this request and added another seat. At the same time, the French Concession Municipal Council, as an independent organ, did not want to rely on others regarding the telephone rate increase issue and politely declined the invitation from the Public Concession Municipal Council, instead hiring its own French telephone expert. This expert would attend the expert committee meetings as an observer to cooperate. The Chinese, British, and French experts have all gathered in Shanghai in recent days, and the American expert also arrived in Shanghai yesterday. In the near future, the experts will conduct a thorough investigation into the current telephone business in the city, thereby seeking a fair and appropriate pricing method. On the one hand, this will prevent the burden on citizens from increasing and ensure that public convenience is not affected. On the other hand, it will enable the company to seek stable investment profits through cost savings and organizational improvements. This is what the citizens of this city expect from the experts.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Company's request for a rate increase this time, on the one hand, claims to increase total revenue by 22.8% so that the company's net profit can reach 10%. On the other hand, it proposes to adopt a new system of charging per call. We have no objection in principle to the general implementation of the new system, but we cannot remain silent on the so-called increase in net profit. The company's net profit last year was 6.13%, which is quite commendable in today's depressed economy. Now, it insists on increasing net profit to 10% based on the franchised business contract, which shows a lack of attention to the current social conditions. Considering the affordability of the average user today, a price increase may not necessarily increase the company's net profit. Some may argue that a 10% net profit is stipulated in the Municipal Council's franchised business contract, and the company has a legitimate reason to insist on it. This view is also very superficial. It should be known that international treaties can be amended or abolished based on the international law principle of "change of circumstances." How can ordinary commercial contracts remain unchanged?</p>
<p>Furthermore, the telephone company's so-called net profit refers to the difference between the company's total revenue and total expenditure in a year. It is found that the company's annual expenditures include a certain percentage of depreciation, amortization of share issuance costs, annual taxes levied by the United States, interest on various incomes other than capital, annual taxes on operating rights, and operating and management expenses. Among these, the depreciation of the company's assets, the U.S. government's income tax, and the company's management fees are substantial. It is incomprehensible that these are not included in the scope of the expert investigation. Moreover, according to the company's own claim, operating expenses are extremely streamlined. However, according to the letter from the Nanjing Road Businessmen's Association to the Municipal Council, the annual cost of the telephone company entrusting the Shanghai Electric Power Company to repair telephone equipment reaches a staggering 400,000 taels. The advertising is reportedly handled by a certain company, and the amount is also considerable. The high salaries paid to foreign employees seem difficult to avoid exceeding general standards. All of these concern the company's internal operations, which outsiders are not willing to interfere with, but they have a considerable impact on the overall issue. It is unknown whether the experts can also consider these matters.</p>

Foreign Secretary Hoare met with Minister Without Portfolio Eden, who had returned from Paris, and then had an audience with the British monarch to discuss solutions. Prime Minister Baldwin, who is vacationing in Aix, also plans to return to London quickly upon hearing of the failure of the tripartite conference to convene an emergency cabinet meeting. The points of concern regarding Italy's invasion of Ethiopia that are felt in this area today include the following: (1) Deep concern that Italy will threaten Britain's water rights in Lake Tana, as Italy has hinted at this. (2) People of color around the world will be agitated. (3) Deep concern that Italy will strengthen its position in the Red Sea, thereby threatening Britain's sea route to India. (4) Deep concern that Italy will covet Egypt, Sudan, Arabia, and the Persian Gulf. According to recent population statistics, there are 52,000 Italians in Egypt, while there are only 34,000 British. (5) The Anglo-French-Italian front against Germany established in Stresa has collapsed, which is very inconvenient for Britain. (6) The situation in Central Europe will be difficult to stabilize after Italy engages in the East African war. Due to these six concerns, the British political circles feel deeply uneasy. According to general observation, Britain may conduct further consultations with the United States and France, which is not yet known. (National Telegram dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<h3 id="e26">Key British Government Figures Rush Back from Vacation, Foreign Secretary Enters Palace for Audience with the Monarch <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Baldwin today warned the cabinet members to prepare to attend the cabinet meeting to be held in Geneva. This meeting will probably be convened on Friday of this week, and all cabinet members will attend. Baldwin will return to Beijing from the Aix-les-Bains vacation resort. Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain will return to Switzerland. Baldwin decided to convene the cabinet meeting after hearing of the failure of the tripartite conference in Paris, but he must first consult with Foreign Secretary Hoare before doing so. The next cabinet meeting was originally scheduled for September 24, but during the parliamentary recess, the Prime Minister warned the cabinet members that the Abyssinian issue was urgent and might force them to suspend their vacations. There is no possibility of convening Parliament at the moment. It will only be convened when the situation worsens further and the cabinet wants to obtain Parliament's support. The government will decide whether to convene Parliament immediately or wait until the recess ends on October 29, depending on the outcome of the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting on September 4. It is reported that Foreign Secretary Hoare will enter the palace for an audience with the monarch tonight. (Reuters dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Hoare will cancel his vacation tonight and return to Beijing. Hoare will meet with Minister Without Portfolio Eden after returning to London and then participate in a secret cabinet meeting. According to reports, a full cabinet meeting will be held this month, and the agenda includes the issue of whether Britain should lift the ban on arms exports. It is said that if the ban is lifted, it would be tantamount to Britain recognizing Italy as an aggressor. Other important issues include increasing the defense force in Sudan and protecting British interests in African territories. (National Telegram dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Paris) British Prime Minister Baldwin flew back to London from the Aix vacation area today to convene a special cabinet meeting to discuss the new situation regarding the Italo-Ethiopian issue. Italian representative Aloisi led the entire delegation back to Rome last night. Before his departure, Aloisi declared to the press corps that although the conference had failed, the three countries of France, Britain, and Italy would continue to maintain the Stresa common policy.

<p>(Paris) Now that the tripartite conference has failed, Europe has entered its most critical period since the Great War. Politicians in various countries are deeply concerned that four consequences will occur, which will have extremely adverse effects on the whole of Europe. They can be summarized as follows: (1) Italy and Ethiopia go to war. (2) The League of Nations disintegrates. (3) War breaks out in Europe. (4) Racial incidents occur in Asia and Africa. Currently, most politicians have completely abandoned hope of avoiding the Italo-Ethiopian war, so they have turned to studying how to deal with the aftermath of the war. Moreover, the credibility of the League of Nations is increasingly collapsing, so that European countries, regardless of size, have restored the old system of alliances and counter-alliances. At present, the only hope for peace lies in the following four aspects: (1) French Prime Minister Laval wants to personally appeal to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini for peace in the hope of changing Italy's course. (2) The League of Nations Administrative Council will discuss the Italo-Ethiopian dispute on September 4. (3) Britain is trying to do everything possible to maintain peace. (4) If Hitler makes a statement, he may be able to save the situation. Today, it is generally recognized that after Mussolini rejected the Anglo-French proposal, he did not propose any other solutions, which shows that there is no room for negotiation other than war. (National Telegram dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Politicians in various countries are deeply concerned today that if Italy and Abyssinia actually go to war, all the black people in the world will oppose the white people. Abyssinia's representative to the League of Nations, Hawa Ria, declared today that Abyssinia is not alarmed by the failure of the tripartite conference because Abyssinia hopes that the League of Nations will implement the covenant and use methods against Italy when Italy invades. Moreover, the League of Nations has not prevented Italy from preparing for war, so it should at least take the above-mentioned actions. Once a war breaks out, all people of color in the world will take Abyssinia as an example of the white race's unfair treatment of the black race, and the whole world will be affected.

<p>Dublin. The Administrative President of the Irish Free State, de Valera, has decided to personally go to Geneva to participate in the September 4 meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council to express the South Irish government's views on the Italo-Ethiopian dispute and to cooperate fully with the League of Nations to maintain peace and the independence of Ethiopia.

<p>Berbera. British Somaliland is now a blockade zone. According to an announcement here today, no one may enter without the permission of Governor Sir Lawrence. If war breaks out between Italy and Ethiopia, this ban will have to be relaxed slightly, as thousands of British and British-protected nationals in Harar province hope to seek refuge in British territory. Those who remain will be housed in the gardens of the British consulate. It is reported that the Italians are currently engaged in opening an air route between Mogadishu and Europe, passing through Berbera and Djibouti, but it will take at least six weeks to prepare before flights can begin.

<p>(Paris) British representative Eden and Italian representative Aloisi visited Foreign Minister Laval this morning to bid farewell. Aloisi met with Laval for half an hour, and Eden only talked with Laval for a short time. There was no official announcement. After meeting with the Ethiopian ambassador at the British Embassy, Eden informed him of the progress of the tripartite conference and then returned to London in the afternoon. (National Telegram dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Italian representative Aloisi made a statement to the press before departing for home at 7:00 PM today, stating that "Security is the main purpose of Italian policy. Italy had previously established an agreement with Britain and France on a common security policy for Europe and has decided to continue it and it will never change because of the result of the tripartite conference in Paris. The task that Italy assumes in Europe is as important as that of Britain and France. Although Italy's security position in Europe is not a concern, colonial security must be guaranteed before it can fulfill its task in Europe. For fifty years, Abyssinia has never complied with the various treaties that we jointly signed. As for the claim that Italy did not propose a solution to the dispute at the Paris conference, it is not true. In fact, the three countries of Britain, France, and Italy all made claims at the conference, but unfortunately, their opinions could not be unified. Although the three countries will still conduct talks through diplomatic channels in the future, it is doubtful whether they will be successful. As for the possibility of a conflict between Britain and Italy, it is definitely not a problem, as I and British Minister Without Portfolio Eden held talks in Paris, always with the most sincere attitude. Some people fear that the concentration of Italian troops in Africa will endanger Italy's position in Europe. In fact, Italy's security in Europe is not a concern. Italy has made careful consideration of the situation in all aspects. The Italian troops concentrated in Italian Eritrea and Somaliland currently number 200,000, while the Abyssinian armed forces, which can directly threaten Italian colonies, number 450,000, but the Italian troops can still cope with it with ease. In addition, one million Italian army soldiers will soon participate in large-scale exercises in northern Italy. Italy lacks raw materials, and its only reliance is on its brave soldiers. Moreover, Italy's actions in Africa will not affect Italy's policy towards Austria. Italy's policy towards Austria is completely consistent with that of Britain and France. Italy also does not want to withdraw from the League of Nations. Italy still intends to send representatives to attend the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting on September 4, but the final decision will be based on the development of the situation. In short, to ensure the safety of the East African colonies, Abyssinia must be disarmed and strictly supervised. The reason why the Anglo-French proposal was rejected by Italy is that it only advocates economic control, such as supervising postal and telecommunications and border police, while Italy believes that it is not enough. As for the Wal-Wal incident, Italian troops have been stationed in the area for five years. Not only have the Italian troops not attacked Abyssinia, but they have also been attacked by Abyssinian troops. Logically, Italy can file a complaint with the League of Nations. Recently, the Abyssinian government selected the Greek ambassador to France, Politis, as the fifth neutral arbitrator, and Italy did not object, which shows Italy's desire to settle matters peacefully. However, the basis for future negotiations is still unknown." (Havas dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The "Tribune" commented on the failure of the Paris tripartite conference, strongly stating that Italy should retain the possibility of various actions, but said that before the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting on September 4, diplomatic negotiations between Britain, France, and Italy might achieve results and reduce the dispute between Britain and Italy. (Havas dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Reliable official sources told the Associated Press today that Prime Minister Mussolini is prepared to wage war on Ethiopia, regardless of other countries' bans or blockades. Mussolini has been preparing for months so that Italy can be self-sufficient in everything during wartime, so he is not afraid of the League of Nations or Britain's economic blockade. From the beginning, Mussolini regarded the African dispute not only as a war against Ethiopia but also as a diplomatic conflict with Britain and as Italy's first resistance to Britain since the European era. (National Telegram dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Official sources do not make any criticism of the failure of the Paris tripartite talks. It is generally believed that the responsible authorities are waiting for the report from Italian representative Aloisi to understand Britain's true attitude, as Italian sources believe that Britain's tough attitude is the main reason for the failure of the tripartite talks. The semi-official "Italian Daily" stated that Italy has no so-called demands and is willing to listen to any suggestions. As for why the suggestions of various countries cannot be unified, it is because there is not only a superficial conflict of opinions but also a conflict between reality and fantasy, and a conflict between practical solutions and sophistry.

<p>Addis Ababa. After the failure of the Paris tripartite conference, people here believe that the situation is extremely serious, saying that the only hope at present lies in the League of Nations breaking the differential treatment between large and small countries and taking action to prevent war. The Abyssinian government has now strictly prohibited the export of silver, and no one leaving the country may carry more than 50 pounds of silver, except for the purchase of military supplies. National defense work is currently being carried out diligently. 15,000 troops from Xuya Province will be stationed near the capital this week and are now equipped with new weapons and sent to be stationed in Tagai Province.

<p>Giggiga, Ethiopia. A special Reuters correspondent describes the conditions of the 60-mile road from Dire Dawa to Giggiga, saying that the road is extremely bad, but at present, huge numbers of military supplies shipped from Berbera to Ethiopia daily pass through this road. Small batches of rifles and ammunition can be transported in, but cannons or any other heavy combat equipment are difficult to transport. The only major road for Ethiopia to transport military supplies is to take the route through Djibouti and then transport them by the Franco-Ethiopian Railway. This area, which the Italian army must advance through, is exceptionally treacherous, with high-altitude areas in the middle. The area is slow to advance, and marshes alternate with volcanic rock. It is easy to contract malaria in the area. The Ethiopians are skilled in using forests as cover. At first, you hope to find no soldiers, but in a moment, armed teams gather from all directions, as if by magic. The Ethiopian villages are scattered, but they are all very small. You must walk hundreds of yards to see them. Well-informed Europeans say that if the Ethiopians can use tactics to defend themselves, the Italian army's difficulties will increase greatly. If they fight in close formation, they will be easily destroyed by the Italian army's modern weapons. (Special dispatch from the North-China Daily News on August 18)</p>

However, due to the current severe situation, for the sake of settling matters peacefully, the Ethiopian arbitrators are willing to participate in the arbitration work under these conditions. The Italian arbitrator immediately stated that the Ethiopian arbitrators had no right to make this official statement but believed that the dispute had ended, so he no longer raised objections.

<p>(Tokyo) Matsuoka, President of the South Manchuria Railway (Mantetsu), visited Minister of War Hayashi at 10:00 AM on the 10th to exchange important opinions on the management of Mantetsu. Also present were Kawagoe, Deputy Director of the Manchurian Affairs Bureau; Hashimoto, Vice-Minister of the Army; Imai, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau; and Hashimoto, Chief of the Military Affairs Section. Minister of War Hayashi first told President Matsuoka that since the September 18th Incident, Mantetsu had cooperated with the military in implementing national policies towards Manchuria, for which he was deeply grateful. He stated that strengthening national defense was even more important in the future and expressed hope that Mantetsu would achieve its objectives in a spirit of cooperation. He also noted that the cabinet had decided to transfer administrative rights over Mantetsu's attached areas to "Manchukuo" and urged Mantetsu's leadership to handle the matter with a cautious attitude. Subsequently, President Matsuoka explained his fundamental policy for managing Mantetsu, and the two exchanged various opinions. After the meeting, President Matsuoka told reporters that the issue of Mantetsu's reorganization had not been discussed today. He explained that he had only recently assumed the position of president and had no knowledge of the reorganization issue, but he would investigate the actual situation after taking office and then make a decision on the matter. (20th United News of Japan dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) During his meeting with Matsuoka, President of the South Manchuria Railway, on the 20th, Minister of War Hayashi, in his capacity as the President of Manchurian Affairs, briefly stated to Matsuoka that in order to strengthen economic mutual assistance between Japan and Manchuria, a Japan-Manchuria Economic Joint Committee had been established. He hoped that Mantetsu executives would fully cooperate to ensure that the committee achieved its important mission. It was noted that Mantetsu had never been involved in this matter before. This time, Minister of War Hayashi hoped that Mantetsu would cooperate and that Mantetsu would be incorporated into the structure of the joint committee in some form. Therefore, they are gathering authoritative personnel to conduct thorough investigations in various categories. Thus, once the Japan-Manchuria Economic Joint Committee decides on specialized investigations and concrete strategies, the utilization of Mantetsu's comprehensive and substantial data will be an extremely effective method and an appropriate means for the committee to achieve its important objectives, as expected by all parties. Therefore, once the Joint Committee formally begins its activities, Mantetsu can dispatch experts from among its employees to assist as temporary committee members for concrete investigations. (20th United News of Japan dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Minister of War Hayashi, during his meeting with Matsuoka, President of the South Manchuria Railway, issued the following eight instructions: (1) In relation to national defense and national policy during emergencies, Mantetsu's mission is extremely important; therefore, closer liaison with the Kwantung Army is desired. (2) Since "Manchukuo" became independent, Mantetsu's position has changed from a political organ to a business enterprise; therefore, attention should be paid to this point in the future. (3) When developing the economy of North China, Mantetsu will be the central mechanism, so preparations are desired. (4) It is hoped that Mantetsu employees will thoroughly understand the times. (5) As for what the President of the Manchurian Affairs Bureau and you should pay attention to, Mantetsu's mission has already become greatly expanded, so it is hoped that the internal mindset will be refreshed to ensure thoroughness. (6) After the abolition of extraterritoriality and the transfer of administrative rights, the administrative rights of Mantetsu's attached areas will be transferred; therefore, it is hoped that this will be handled well. (7) Mantetsu's committee members have not participated in the Japan-Manchuria Joint Economic Committee, so cooperation is especially desired. (8) Attention should be paid to the funds for developing Manchurian enterprises. (20th Domei News Agency dispatch)</p>

They saw that there were 10 disaster-stricken counties, and there are now more than two million disaster victims. Each person needs one yuan per month, which also requires more than two million yuan.

<p>(Kaifeng) Reporter, Xu Shiying, Fang Juehui, Supervisory Committee Member Wang Hongxian, and Provincial Committee Chang Zhizhen, etc., went to Dongzhuang around 8 am on the 19th. Walking along the river dike to Lankao Fan, the eastern dike was narrow and low, with very few stone works. No wonder there were 14 breaches between Lanfeng and Dongzhuang from the beginning of the Republic of China until now. Eighty villages in the southern Hebei section were all flooded, and no crops were harvested for four years. Three-fifths of the people fled. The second, second, fourth sections are the same. Straw huts are on the dike, and disaster victims live in cold villages. Because the river water brushes against villages such as Liuzhuang, Luzhai, and Zhouzhai, the remaining houses and belongings are dismantled and moved onto the dike, and together with thin coffins lying horizontally and mats wrapped around human bones, it feels even more tragic. Xiaoliuzhuang's Daliuding was washed away, and the dike construction was dangerous and is currently being rushed. The dangerous project at Zhukou is about two li long, with materials such as millet, bricks, and stones piled up like mountains, and the project is huge. Disaster victims in Dongzhuang are prostrate and wailing for relief. There is a lot of silt in the first, second, third, and fourth openings. The fifth and sixth openings are combined into one, about three li wide and more than three zhang deep. It has taken over Daliu, and 90% is submerged, 300 li long.

<p>Central Bank: The London silver market was quite quiet. The spot price remained unchanged at 19 pence. Futures fell by 0.375 to 28.1475. China and India sold, and the United States bought. The currency market stabilized, and futures were sluggish due to Indian sales.</p>
<p>Exchange Rates</p>
<p>British-American: The London foreign exchange market had good trading this morning, with no major price changes. The pound was slightly lower. The opening exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar was 4.9825. Yesterday's US-British market closed 0.25 higher. Within the first hour, it rose by 0.06. There have been no changes since then.</p>
<p>British-French: The opening price was 0.02 francs, up a fraction. It rose in the middle of the day, and continued to rise in the afternoon. The rate was 70 francs.</p>
<p>Cotton and Wheat</p>
<p>US Cotton: The New York cotton market opened lower because there has been no concrete announcement regarding cotton loans. The market continued to decline afterward, but the market stabilized shortly after. Today's general opinion is that the market is being manipulated by speculation. The rumor that Secretary of Agriculture Wallace Yang will resign if the government approves the loan of 0.02 per pound of cotton is not valid.</p>
<p>British Cotton: The Liverpool cotton market was slightly soft today. In the afternoon, the October futures price fell two points to 6.01.</p>

<p>London: The London rubber market remained quiet this morning. The成交 prices for October and December futures were 5.75 pence at noon, the same as yesterday's price.</p>
<p>New York: The New York rubber market opened lower due to increased inventories in London and the United States. The market stabilized after the decline.</p>
<p>Securities</p>
<p>New York: New York securities opened slightly lower again today due to continued profit-taking by bulls. It is expected that the amendment to the Wheeler Public Utility Act will be passed by Congress before it adjourns, so public utility stocks weakened again. Although domestic and foreign political situations are unsettled, market sentiment is still strong. Shortly after the opening, market prices trended upward, with some divergence. Railroad stocks and oil stocks were quite stable, steel stocks showed improvement, and other metal stocks also rose in price due to reports that a certain strong European country had ordered hardware. The Dow Jones Thirty Industrial Stock Average opened at 126.17, down 0.16. Prices were as follows:</p>

<p>— Special Correspondent Qian Hua of This Newspaper</p>
<p>(Seventeen) Nanning, the Political Center</p>
<p>The Guangxi Provincial Government's reception of members of various academic societies was well-organized. Before most of them left Wuzhou for Nanning, they distributed a book entitled "Notes on Traveling in Guangxi," which had been printed in a rush. The book detailed the history, transportation, and scenic spots of various places. Each member held a copy, which made sightseeing and visiting more convenient after arriving in Nanning. Nanning is the provincial capital with numerous government agencies, making it the political center of the province. The county has an area of 16,904 square li and a population of 352,116. The newly built combined office building of the provincial government is magnificent and modern. The annual conference venue was set up in the provincial government auditorium. The city's roads are flat, and the bustling streets are full of merchants. All the equipment of modern cities is available, such as automatic telephones, running water, and wireless radio stations. However, it is just a miniature version. In recent days, the reporter has visited the museum, printing factory, water plant, radio station, library, livestock conservation, medical school, livestock conservation institute, native cloth factory, dyeing and weaving factory, National Basic Education Research Institute, and leather factory. Most of these are in their initial stages. Although the equipment is relatively simple, their hard work and dedication to serving the people can be seen everywhere. Highways reach all counties, and transportation depends on public buses and automobiles. Rickshaws are extremely rare, not to mention sedan chairs. Nine out of ten people can walk comfortably. Laborers enter the city from the suburbs in the morning and return to their hometowns in the evening, traveling dozens of li every day. They are used to it. Diligence, thrift, and endurance are their characteristics. Therefore, a small number of public buses are sufficient. Most of the private cars are the latest streamlined models. In addition to a few high-ranking officials who have their own cars, there are also car rental companies. The Fourth Group Army Headquarters and the provincial government, the two major institutions, have many official cars for senior officials to ride in, so street traffic is easy to maintain. Those who travel to Guilin always say that the authorities advocate humanitarianism and prohibit rickshaws from running on the streets. According to people in the provincial government, this is not true. Humanitarianism should be advocated, but it is definitely not prohibited by order. In Wuzhou, you can see rickshaws. Nanning has also had several people start rickshaw companies, but they have failed after a short trial. This is because of a natural trend. People are accustomed to hard work and do not need to spend money to have others take their place, which is also a fact.</p>
<p>(Eighteen) Liu Yongfu's Military Flag</p>
<p>Although the Nanning Museum is not large and does not have many exhibits, its arrangement is well-organized, and the selection of materials and simple explanations can arouse public interest and are beneficial to social education. When the reporter visited, women and children were particularly crowded, pointing and explaining as if they had learned something. The most valuable exhibits include the costumes, daily necessities, musical instruments such as bells and drums, talismans, and various superstitious images of the Miao and Yao ethnic groups in Guizhou Province in the first room. There are also handwritten vulgar works such as love letters and love songs of young men and women of the Miao and Yao ethnic groups, which are all treasures. Secondly, there is the Guangxi Special Products Exhibition, the distribution of Guangxi's minerals and crops, and portraits of famous people from Guangxi in history hanging on the walls. The ancient objects such as bells and tripods unearthed in various parts of Guangxi also make considerable contributions to geography, history, archeology, and ethnology. In the eighth room, the trophies of the Fourth Group Army during the Northern Expedition are displayed. On the left wall hangs a square military flag of Liu Yongfu's army, about seven or eight feet long, made of black cloth with white characters. Small characters say "Guangdong and Guangxi Governor's Standard, Rear Battalion of the Fu Army." In the center is a large character "Liu." According to people in the museum, this flag was just donated by Liu Yunxi, the principal of Bobai Middle School, last week and displayed here. Liu's grandfather, Liu Mingguang, once served as the battalion commander of the Fu Army. In 1883, he participated in the Sino-French War. "In 1885, after the Sino-French peace talks, Liu Yongfu and Liu Mingguang returned to their ancestral home in Bobai. This flag was kept in Liu's family. There are still Fu Army seals and other items that are also planned to be donated to the museum for display in the near future. Liu's achievements in resisting foreign enemies are recorded in history. Today, looking at the relics, I can't help but feel awe.</p>
<p>(Nineteen) The Facilities of Hygiene Administration</p>
<p>When the reporter visited the Provincial Medical College, he met with Dean Ge Shaolong. Ge is the cousin of Ge Gongzhen. They talked very happily. According to Ge, the medical college started operating in November of last year. The provincial government gives an annual budget of 110,000 yuan. It also has outpatient clinics in various departments, with 26 internal and surgical doctors and professors, more than 40 undergraduate students, and more than 50 nurses. Its purpose is to train hygiene cadres. All students are tuition-free and are sent to serve in various rural areas after graduation. Guizhou Province pays close attention to the facilities of hygiene administration. Guizhou is vast and sparsely populated. Sound hygiene administration, in the active aspect, rapidly increases the production rate under healthy conditions, and in the preventive aspect, can gradually reduce the devastation of epidemics. The Guizhou Provincial Government has established a Hygiene Committee, whose standing members are the Director of the Education Department, the Director of the Civil Affairs Department, the Director of the Military Medical Department of the General Headquarters, and myself. The committee plans the province's hygiene administration affairs. In various countries, hygiene expenses account for 17 percent of the country's administrative expenses in the United States, 13 percent in Japan, and about one-thousandth in our country. In Guizhou Province, it accounts for a little more than 7 percent of the province's administrative expenses. The budget for hygiene expenses in the 24th year of the Republic was more than 900,000 yuan. The province's more than 90 counties are divided into eight districts. Each district has a provincial hospital, which also manages various hygiene administration affairs. Those that have been established include Wuzhou, Guilin, and Nanning. Wuzhou also has a pharmaceutical factory that produces various anti-epidemic vaccines. Liuzhou has already sent people to prepare. Longzhou, Baise, and Pingle have also prepared to send people to these cities in succession. In addition, it is planned to set up a hygiene experiment institute and a drug planting experiment field in Nanning or Wuzhou. In terms of epidemic prevention, it is one of the most important tasks of hygiene administration. Staff members are sent to various rural villages from time to time to inject anti-epidemic vaccines. In the past, people often said that the southwestern border had a lot of miasma, and those who were affected would become ill or even die. Longzhou and Baise on the border of Guizhou Province were even worse. The mortality rate was shocking. The sparse population is also the biggest reason for this. What exactly is miasma? Doctors have carefully studied it many times. Our college also pays special attention to this disease, sending staff to Longzhou, Baise and other places to investigate and treat it. Three weeks ago, it was reported that more than 300 people died of miasma in a village in Baise. It has recently been found that what is called miasma is actually a tropical disease, malaria. The fever lasts for a long time, or it may not subside completely. In severe cases, people can die in three or four hours. It spreads very quickly and is very scary. Taking a small amount of quinine every day can prevent the epidemic. In addition, leprosy is most prevalent in Guangdong and Guizhou. It is currently planned to set up a large-scale leprosy hospital in Longzhou. It is hoped that philanthropists from all over the world will enthusiastically support it and provide economic assistance.</p>

<p>(London) Rumors of difficulties in the Bombay silver market were caused by large-scale sales by India in London today. The US government is currently maintaining the spot price to stabilize it, but the futures price has plummeted. The London silver market was slightly unstable today, fearing that the financial difficulties of a certain merchant in Bombay would affect other merchants, which would cause the Bombay silver price to fall and India to sell even more in the London market. (Reuters dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>Bombay: The Bombay silver market opened very late today, and sentiment was unstable. Trading was limited due to rumors that some important merchants would not be able to fulfill their obligations at the current settlement.

<p>Zhou Pinshan, a farmer from Wangjia Village, Wangting Township, is quite well-off. Last month, Zhou and his 12-year-old eldest son, Longsheng, were kidnapped by bandits, who demanded a ransom of 5,000 yuan.

On the 19th, they were transported to the reeds on the lakeside for the night. When the bandits watching the victims were sound asleep deep in the night, Zhou Pinshan and his son took the opportunity to swim to the shore.

<p>The Wuxi Sericulture Model District, in view of the shortage of silkworm seeds in the spring of this year, which caused a great turmoil, has made early preparations for this autumn seed. The district has ordered various seedbeds to produce as many seeds as possible, which are actually sufficient for distribution. The district has also distributed the seeds to various guidance stations in advance on the 15th, and then distributed them to the silkworm farmers in batches from the 17th to the 20th, in order to prevent seed traffickers from manipulating the market and hoarding. Unexpectedly, various traffickers still used the excuse of free trade and claimed that there was still a large shortage of seeds, and manipulated the market in secret. The Construction Department and the Sericulture Model District have received telegrams from the County Party Headquarters Supervision Committee and local people, one after another, requesting an investigation and ban on seed traffickers raising prices and hoarding. The district immediately telegraphed the county magistrate to order the County Public Security Bureau, together with the model district, to send personnel in disguise for secret investigation. The previous night, Ge Xinde, a supervisor of the Public Security Bureau, first used banknotes with a seal, and bought ten Tiger Brand seeds at the Datong Inn on the road, at a price of 6 jiao per seed, which was an increase of 2 jiao from the original quota. The evidence was conclusive. He immediately led the police to investigate and found 100 Heping Brand seeds without a certificate of qualification. The inn's accountant, Wang Senlin, and the innkeeper's wife, Zhang (nicknamed Black Fish Head), were all taken to the bureau. Yesterday morning (20th), Zhang Zhaozhen, the manager of Datong, voluntarily turned himself in to the bureau and explained everything. After Director Chen interrogated him, he was sent to the county government for interrogation together.</p>

<p>Fan A-quan, a resident of Beixingtang Village, District 7, was murdered on a ferryboat on the night of the 5th of this month. The deceased's uncle, Fan Yongshen, the village head Fan Bingda, and Fan Yunting, Madam Chen Zhu, etc., reported to the court requesting that the coffin be opened for inspection. Upon receiving the report, the Procuratorate dispatched bailiff Huang Yong to the village to seal the coffin and escort it to the river at the Diaqiao Bridge outside Ximen. Village head Jiang Zixian of Huishan also constructed a shed at the desolate tomb behind Wanshou Temple, setting up the scene. Yesterday (the 20th), at 7:40 AM, Prosecutor Shen Zhaoming led coroner Wang, bailiffs, and others to conduct the inspection. Upon arriving at the scene, they ordered workers to open the coffin. Coroner Wang then removed the deceased's skull, which was already black and severely decomposed, making examination difficult. The rotten flesh was scraped off, placed in a wooden basin, and washed with clean water. Then, three sections of the cervical vertebrae were removed and washed in the same manner. Coroner Wang completed the washing and examination at 8:45 AM, covering the skull and three sections of the cervical vertebrae with scallion roots and coarse paper, pouring sorghum liquor over them, and removing them after ten minutes. After examination according to the law, it was found that there was a bluish color on the temporal bone, and red color was discovered on the cervical vertebrae. Two upper incisors, one upper canine tooth, two lower incisors, and two lower canine teeth also had red color, indicating that the deceased was strangled to death before. After the examination, the corpse's relative, Fan Yongshen, was ordered to inspect the body. Fan stated that the left and right cheeks and cheekbones also had red color, which he presumed was caused by blows. Coroner Wang stated that this type of red color was insignificant and would not be fatal even if struck. At this point, Prosecutor Shen ordered workers to place the skeletal remains in the coffin, seal it, and put it under guard for burial in the countryside. The three sections of the cervical vertebrae and seven upper and lower incisors were taken to the court for preservation. The suspects Fan Wenqing, Fan Shigen, and the deceased's concubine, Xi Xiaomei, were also taken to the court. Prosecutor Shen then opened the court for interrogation. As a result, Xi Xiaomei, Fan Shigen, and Fan Wenqing were each ordered to be detained, and the plaintiff, Fan Yongshen, was ordered to return home to await further investigation.</p>

After the incident, he fled and has not been reported. If he is arrested, they fear being implicated. They tied up Wei Qing and reported it to the township head to be submitted to the district and then to the county, etc. District Head Zhai immediately transferred him to the county government for interrogation. On the 19th, County Magistrate Hou transferred him to the Supervisory Office of the Local Court. After interrogation by Prosecutor Guan Jun, he was ordered to be detained.

Counties that should increase ten to fifteen school levels will be commended if they can establish fifteen school levels. Those who fail to establish ten levels will be penalized. Educational administrative personnel will be assessed by the Department of Education and rewarded or punished accordingly. Most of the funding for new compulsory schools has been subsidized by the central government and provincial funds. Counties must ensure that the small amount of funding they are required to raise is sufficient to implement the plan gradually.</p>

<p>Shen Bulin, a worker at the Dasheng Third Factory in Changle Town, District 3, and his wife, Yang, worked at the factory. They had been working for several years, and their hard-earned income was enough to support them. Recently, Yang fell ill after childbirth and was laid off from work. The family's income decreased sharply, and medical expenses were high. With a family of several people, it was difficult to make ends meet. Under these circumstances, Yang felt overwhelmed by poverty and illness and developed a desire to end her life. On the morning of the 16th, she hanged herself without anyone noticing. The family discovered her and tried to rescue her, but she had been dead for a long time and could not be revived. Yesterday (the 17th), the workers at the same factory, feeling sorry for her poverty, pooled money together for a coffin and burial.</p>

<p>Farmers in the northeastern townships of this county rioted because they could not bear the abuse of weighing seeds during the forced labor to accumulate soil, which aroused public outrage. Yesterday (the 17th) at 10:00 AM, a group of over three thousand people gathered with farming tools and went to the city to destroy the judicial office hall, the police chief's office of the county government, and beat the secretary Sun Juexian, bailiff Yun Qi, etc. They then destroyed the first district office and the residence of Jia Fengren, the head of the construction section. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. The villagers did not leave the city and return to their villages until 10:00 PM. County Magistrate Cao returned to the city last night at 8:00 PM after receiving a telegram in Jieshou and immediately imposed martial law. All four city gates were guarded by troops, fearing that bandits would take the opportunity to infiltrate. Therefore, pedestrians were only allowed to leave the city and not enter. This morning, over a hundred farmers again gathered with small flags and rioted at the county government, trying to force their way in. Wang Yingyu, the captain of the third detachment of the provincial security team stationed in the post office, led his team to maintain order and prevent conflict. In the end, the villagers were driven out of the city. During the conflict, Wang Guangshan, a villager, had his head broken. Two strong villagers, Zhao Jinkui and Xu Zhaogen, were arrested on the spot and sent to the county for prosecution. Although the villagers have left the city, County Magistrate Cao fears that the villagers will still riot in the city, so he has closed the four city gates and prohibited traffic, cutting off transportation. He also filmed the destruction and reported it to the Provincial Government Construction Department for review.</p>

<p>Yang Limu, a resident of Yangjiagang, Fenghui Township, Yinxi, started his career as a farmer and accumulated some savings. On the evening of May 28th, he was suddenly robbed by many bandits with guns. Before leaving, they kidnapped his seven-year-old son, Xingyuan. They hired a boat overnight and arrived at the Jiangbei bank of this port at around 7:00 AM the next morning. Because of their suspicious behavior, they were discovered by detectives of the Ningbo Public Security Bureau. They arrested You Fu on the spot. You Fu confessed that his wife and children were living in the Dafeng Inn. Zhang Xuequan was also arrested, along with Yuan Lishi, and taken to the bureau for questioning. They directly admitted to robbery and kidnapping. Because the case was related to robbery, the Public Security Bureau filed a case with the Zhejiang Security Second Branch for handling. Director Zhao of the branch interrogated the two criminals and found that they were both discharged soldiers. He telegraphed Chairman Chiang for instructions. Chairman Chiang telegraphed back, approving their execution on the spot. This morning (the 19th) at 10:00 AM, the military judge of the Security Second Branch verified their identities, tied them up, and executed them by firing squad on Caoma Road on the Jiangbei bank. As for the hostage Yang Yuanyuan, he was kidnapped and escaped. They are now trying to rescue him.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Tenth Anniversary of the Martyrdom of Liao Zhongkai. Representatives of All Circles Held a General Meeting Yesterday. All Institutions and Organizations Flew Flags at Half-Mast. <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the tenth anniversary of the martyrdom of Mr. Liao Zhongkai, a revolutionary martyr, was commemorated. The municipal party headquarters held a memorial meeting for representatives of all circles at 9:00 AM yesterday morning. The meeting was chaired by Tong Xingbai, chairman of the municipal party committee, who reported the significance of the commemoration and ended the meeting with slogans. All institutions and organizations flew flags at half-mast for one day. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Representatives Attending:</p>
<p>Wang Zong of the Jianghai Customs Supervisory Office, Lin Kecong of the Women's Association, Long Peiyun of the General Labor Union, Yu Yaoqiu of the Baoshan Fellow Villagers Association, Leng Xueqiao of Fudan University, Jiang Shouchun of Tongji University, Wang Zhang of the Popular Knowledge Guidance Association, Dai Yongchan of the Jiangsu Fellow Villagers Association, Wang Kegui of the Municipal Education Association, Jin Guangmei of the Women's Promotion Association, Zhu Shide of the China National Products Maintenance Association, Huang Xianggu of the Second Special Zone Citizen Association, Tong Xingbai of the Municipal Party Committee, all staff members, and representatives of various schools, totaling over one hundred people.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report:</p>
<p>After the ritual, Chairman Tong Xingbai reported that today is the tenth anniversary of the martyrdom of Liao Zhongkai, a martyr of our party. Many of Mr. Liao's achievements are worthy of our admiration. Mr. Liao grew up in the United States and returned to his native Guangdong province at the age of seventeen. By then, Mr. Liao had a foundation in Chinese studies and a considerable understanding of science. At the age of twenty-two, he married Ms. He Xiangning. However, because of Mr. Liao's great ambitions, he continued to pursue his studies, and Ms. He was able to contribute her private savings to help Mr. Liao go to Japan to study. Later, Ms. He also went to Japan, so the couple had a very deep relationship. At that time, the Russo-Japanese War broke out, and China's territory became the battlefield for the two countries. Sun Yat-sen, was saddened by the increasingly critical situation of the country. In Japan, he united comrades from seventeen provinces to organize the Chinese Tongmenghui, and Mr. and Mrs. Liao also joined. Mr. Liao originally belonged to the field of economic research, so Mr. Liao was appointed to plan finances. After the success of the Xinhai Revolution, Mr. Liao presided over the financial affairs of Guangdong province. After the failure of the campaign against Yuan Shikai in 1913, Mr. Liao followed Sun Yat-sen to Japan again to help Sun Yat-sen organize the Chinese Revolutionary Party and raise funds up to 10 million yuan. Given the environment of our party being out of power at the time, it was not easy to raise such a large sum of money. Later, the distribution of funds was very organized, which showed Mr. Liao's efforts and expertise in financial management. Later, after Yuan Shikai failed and the warlords were rampant, Mr. Liao followed Sun Yat-sen to Guangdong to prepare for the Northern Expedition. When the Northern Expedition army left Guangdong, Chen Jiongming revolted. Mr. Liao was detained for as long as sixty-two days. However, Mr. Liao did not waver in his aspirations and worked even harder for the revolutionary cause. Later, when Sun Yat-sen went to Shanghai, Mr. Liao also came and devoted himself to propaganda. He also had a book called "Politics for All," which was a great revolutionary work. In 1924, Sun Yat-sen returned to Guangdong and reorganized the Kuomintang. Mr. Liao devoted all his efforts to this and was appointed as the first Standing Committee member and Minister of the Workers' Department. However, he was deeply envied and finally assassinated by thugs at the Central Party Headquarters on this day in 1925. In Mr. Liao's life, we can observe in two aspects: In private life, he was fond of learning and never tired of it. Sun Yat-sen said that revolution is built on deep knowledge. Because Mr. Liao was fond of learning, Mr. Liao made great contributions to the revolution. In public life, Mr. Liao was loyal to the party. The morality advocated by Sun Yat-sen puts loyalty first, because the achievement of any undertaking must have an attitude of loyalty. In the past, China used loyalty to the emperor as a slogan. In the future, we should use loyalty to the country, loyalty to the people, and loyalty to the cause as slogans. Mr. Liao was relied upon for his financial management. In the past, Emperor Gaozu of Han regarded Xiao He as the most meritorious minister because he wanted to reassure the soldiers on the front line and stabilize the order in the rear, which all depended on the proper planning and operation of finance. Therefore, Mr. Liao was a great meritorious minister of our party and one of the most trusted people by Sun Yat-sen.</p>
<p>Memorial Slogans:</p>
<p>1. Mr. Liao's spirit will never die! 2. Mr. Liao is the savior of farmers and workers! 3. Learn from Mr. Liao's revolutionary spirit! 4. Relieve the suffering of farmers and workers! 5. Complete local autonomy! 6. Long live the Three Principles of the People! 7. Long live the Chinese Kuomintang!</p>
<h3 id="e86">Employer Representative to the International Labor Conference, Wang Zhisheng, Returns to Shanghai Yesterday Morning; Wang Discusses Factory Inspections and the ILO's Efforts to Resolve Issues; High Tariff Barriers Lead to Economic Decline in Various Countries <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Wang Zhisheng, the employer representative from our country attending the 19th International Labor Conference, returned home from the United States aboard the Dollar Steamship Company's President McKinley. The ship arrived in port at 7:00 AM yesterday, docking at the Dollar Wharf in Pudong. Those welcoming him at the wharf included representatives from the Chamber of Commerce Federation, the China General Chamber of Industry, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Machinery Industry Association, Wu Wentian, a special representative sent by the Ministry of Industry, and Wang's family members, totaling more than twenty people. They departed from the Customs Wharf at 7:00 AM aboard a Dollar Steamship Company passenger boat to meet him at the Bailianjing Dollar Wharf in Pudong.</p>
<p>Wang Zhisheng Speaks</p>
<p>After exchanging greetings with the welcoming party, Wang Zhisheng spoke in detail to reporters from various newspapers about the conference and its proceedings. He stated, "This is my second time attending the International Labor Conference. This year's conference included three new member states—the United States, Russia, and Afghanistan—in addition to the seven existing member states, such as England and France, bringing the total to sixty countries. The conference took place from June 4th to June 25th. Government, labor, and employer representatives had equal standing in the conference. One of the more important proposals discussed was the working hours issue, which remained unresolved after the previous session due to strong opposition from employers. This time, it was resubmitted for reconsideration. I submitted a written opinion stating our country's position. As an employer representative, I took a proactive stance against the conference proposal, hoping to make general industrial nations aware of our country's current production situation and gain their sympathy. After intense debate among representatives from various countries, a draft for a forty-hour work week was passed. However, this is only a decision in principle, and its implementation depends on the final approval of each country's government. Furthermore, the dumping policies of various countries have a significant impact on our country's industry and commerce. This issue was raised for discussion in a subcommittee and submitted to the conference for restriction, hoping to draw the attention of various countries."</p>

<p>Factory Inspections</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of factory inspections in concessions, our country's representatives raised the issue for discussion again. Although it was not adequately resolved, the Director of the International Labour Office, Mr. Butler, indicated that resolving factory investigations in Chinese concessions is also the responsibility of the International Labour Office. They will contact representatives from relevant countries to urge them to convey this to their respective governments and to abide by Chinese laws and be subject to Chinese inspections. Previously, representatives from England, the United States, France, Italy, and Japan were invited to a subcommittee meeting, which decided that each representative should convey this to their government and instruct their consuls in Shanghai to negotiate. Youth unemployment has become a serious problem in various countries, so the conference paid close attention to it and included it on the agenda. After detailed discussion, relief measures have been drafted.</p>
<p>International Labor Organization</p>
<p>The structure of the International Labour Organization (ILO) is becoming increasingly sound. The ILO was established after the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. The representatives from various participating countries at that time believed that in order to achieve world peace, attention should be paid not only to political issues, but also to economic and social issues. Therefore, a special section was included in the Treaty of Versailles and other treaties, stipulating the establishment of a labour organization to jointly address the solution of labour problems worldwide through international cooperation. A general assembly is held once a year, with each member state sending one labour representative, one employer representative, and two government representatives to form it. This is the highest body of the labour organization. The day-to-day affairs of the organization are handled by the International Labour Office, which is quite large in scale, with more than 500 employees. Branch offices are set up in major countries. The Governing Body of the International Labour Office serves as the supervisory body of the Labour Office, and its status is equivalent to that of the Council of the League of Nations. It has a total of thirty-two council seats, with labour and employer representatives each occupying eight seats and government representatives occupying sixteen seats. Among these sixteen seats, eight are permanently held by major industrial countries such as England and France, while the other eight seats are elected by the General Assembly every three years. Our country was elected as a director last year.</p>
<p>Inspection Process</p>
<p>After the conference closed, I went to various countries in Europe and America with Secretary Zhang Hualian to investigate industry, commerce, finance, and economics. Currently, people in Europe and America generally hold a strong hope for our country, regarding China as a peaceful country in the Far East and earnestly hoping that China can become strong externally. The economic downturn in European countries is more severe than last year. All businesses are adopting austerity policies, and the economy and finance are even more exhausted. The main reasons for this are high tariff barriers, the expansion of military spending, overproduction, and financial stagnation. After arriving in the United States, I inspected various industrial and commercial districts in New York and connected and interacted with local industrial and commercial leaders, exchanging views on promoting Sino-US industry and commerce. After the American economic inspection delegation, which previously came to China, returned to the United States, they provided detailed reports on the economic situation in various parts of our country. People in that country have a more advanced understanding of our country's industry and commerce and are eager to promote Sino-US trade in order to promote the prosperity of China's industry. This time, Secretary Zhang and I visited mints in countries such as England, the United States, France, and Belgium, and conducted a detailed investigation of these businesses. After sorting out the information during the day, I will publish it gradually to contribute to the reform of our country's currency system. Currently, Zhang is still interning at a US mint and will return to China before December of this year to serve in the Central Mint. Advisor Gu Bingyuan is still in Europe inspecting industries and is expected to return to China in the middle of next month.</p>
<p>Heading to the Capital Tomorrow</p>
<p>Wu Wentian, Section Chief of the Labour Department of the Ministry of Industry, came to Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday to represent the Ministry of Industry in welcoming Representative Wang Zhisheng. According to Wang's response to a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency, he will stay in Beijing for a short time and then go to Beijing with Section Chief Wu the day after tomorrow to report to the Ministry. It is also reported that the local China General Chamber of Industry and other agencies and organizations will hold a banquet to welcome Wang and listen to a detailed report on his participation in the conference.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Fundraising Association for Flood Relief in Various Provinces received a cable yesterday from Xu Shiying, the Vice President of the association, from Bianliang (Kaifeng): "To the President, Vice President, Directors, Deputy Directors, Secretaries-General, Deputy Secretaries-General, and all members of the Shanghai Fundraising Association for Flood Relief in Various Provinces: Numerous cables have been sent. I left Yan earlier this morning, passed through Xuzhou at noon, and arrived in Bianliang that evening, because the road from Lanfeng to Dongzhuangkoumen is damaged and muddy, and we must take this route. On the way, I read in the newspapers that the northern Tianjin and Beijing newspapers are actively soliciting donations for flood relief, especially the Ta Kung Pao, which has received a large amount. Looking back at the flood twenty years ago, that newspaper raised more than 200,000 yuan in relief funds, a commendable enthusiasm. Shanghai is the center of public opinion, and the editors of the newspapers are deeply concerned. The proposal of our association to solicit and collect funds should be implemented immediately. With widespread publicity, the effect will be significant. The disaster victims are in dire straits, and the more relief funds, the better. The gentlemen of the newspapers will surely be happy to assist. Respectfully, Shiying bows." Xu Shiying is concerned about the disaster victims, conducts on-site inspections, and travels tirelessly, without even stopping to rest. He has repeatedly and loudly appealed and tearfully pleaded on behalf of the disaster victims. The newspapers and people in society are enthusiastic about saving people and have never lagged behind. They will surely continue to rise up, do their best to raise funds, publicize widely, and achieve significant relief.</p>
<p>Commercial Press Donates 10,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The severity of this year's flood in our country and the misery of the disaster victims have been reported in this newspaper and are well known to people across the country. Now, all sectors of society in Shanghai have organized a disaster relief association for various provinces to raise donations. We have learned that the Commercial Press and all its colleagues have jointly donated 10,000 yuan in national currency. Yesterday, the donation was sent to the association to handle urgent relief. At a time when industry and commerce are declining, the museum and all its colleagues have made this great benevolent act, which is remarkable. However, there is no shortage of public-spirited people in various industries and sectors. If they can step forward without hesitation, urgently catch up, and divert their wasteful funds to comfort the living and save the dying, the tens of millions of disaster victims will be greatly benefited. Attached below is the original letter from the museum to the Shanghai Fundraising Association for Flood Relief in Various Provinces and the letter of thanks from the Flood Relief Association. "To the Shanghai Fundraising Association for Flood Relief in Various Provinces: The summer and autumn floods in the Yangtze River and Yellow River have affected several provinces and tens of millions of disaster victims. At a time when rural areas are declining, this disaster has occurred, showing human sympathy and national duty. We respectfully offer our meager contribution and jointly raise 10,000 yuan in national currency, which is enclosed with this letter. Please accept it and provide urgent relief as soon as possible, and please reply. Sincerely yours, and we wish you peace." The Flood Relief Association's letter of thanks stated: "In reply, the disaster in various provinces is in urgent need of relief. We have received your letter and are grateful for your generous donation of 10,000 yuan in national currency for relief. Your benevolent reputation has spread far and wide, and everyone admires you. In addition to issuing a receipt, we will do our best to be practical and realistic, and rush to send the donation to the disaster area for distribution, hoping to live up to the universal compassion and to save the unprecedented disaster. We especially represent hundreds of millions of disaster victims and send a letter to express our gratitude. We hope that you will publish it. Sincerely and respectfully wish you peace."</p>
<p>Donations Received by This Newspaper Yesterday</p>
<p>This office has been collecting donations for flood relief in various provinces, which has been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday (the 20th), we received an additional 40 yuan from Mr. Dong Anzhong, which is a great joy for the disaster victims.</p>
<p>Red Cross Transports Children's Clothing to Jinan</p>
<p>The Red Cross had previously requested the collection of children's clothing aged three to fifteen from all walks of life for the children of refugees from various disaster areas in the Yellow River, who were mostly naked, in shelters in Jinan. This has been reported in previous newspapers. It is now reported that the association has received a total of 587 pieces of clothing, including single-layer and padded clothing, from benevolent people such as Liang Yuanzhang, Zhang Hongjing, Wang Yilun, Shu Daodi, and Chen Jiqingtang, as well as various public halls such as Yang, He, Wang, Cheng, and Liang. The association has also allocated 400 sets of new shirts and trousers made of plain white cloth, which have been packed together and handed over to the railway business office for transportation to Jinan for distribution. Benevolent people from all walks of life who wish to donate children's clothing for relief are requested to send them directly to the Red Cross at Tangfang Street in the city for forwarding to Nanjing. Those in Zhabei are requested to send them directly to the Red Cross at Baoshan Road, Baoshan Road, Zhabei for forwarding. Those in the concession are requested to send them directly to the association's office at 4 Tongfuli, Julada Road, and the Red Cross at 15 Zhonghe Village, Pushi Road, for verification. If the journey is far, please call 85213 in the concession, and someone will be sent to collect the donations with a receipt. They will be transported as soon as they arrive to save other people's children, which is to create blessings for one's own children.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Internal Notice Regarding the Requisition of Civilian Farmland to Develop the Yuji Mound on the Wusong River; Area Approximately 150 Acres <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The China Society reports that the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission is requisitioning more than 150 acres of civilian farmland for the straightening and diversion of the Wusong River at Yuji Mound and the construction of a new river channel. An internal notice was specifically issued, which stated: "Approved by the National Economic Council's letter No. 4635 Shui Zi dated May 7th of the 24th year, stating, 'According to the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission's submission regarding the straightening and diversion of the Wusong River at Yuji Mound and the construction of a new river channel, it is proposed to requisition civilian farmland, with the area extending from near the Hujia Warehouse in the east to the west of the Huada Brick and Tile Factory in the west, and between the two banks of the Wusong River in the north and south, covering an area of approximately 150 acres. A joint review of the plan and the land requisition area map is requested for review and submission to the Ministry of Interior for approval.' Based on this, an investigation reveals that the Wusong River is a vital waterway for draining water from the lower reaches of Taihu Lake and a shortcut for transporting rice to Suzhou and Shanghai. It is now severely silted up, hindering drainage and navigation, particularly the excessively curved section at Yuji Mound, which is the most detrimental.

<h3 id="e91">Silk Merchants Organize Autumn Cocoon Purchasing Agency; 33 Silk Filatures in Shanghai Are Operational; Fear of Raw Material Shortage as Cocoon Inventory Dwindles <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese silk industry's overseas market is gradually showing activity, with a sharp increase in exports. The price of Grade B silk has risen to 500 yuan in national currency. 33 silk filatures in Shanghai are operational. With cocoon inventory nearing depletion, silk merchants are preparing to organize an autumn cocoon purchasing agency. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Overseas Trade Gradually Improves: The export trade is crucial to the Chinese silk industry. In recent years, the overseas market has been affected by the dumping of Japanese silk, leading to an oversupply of Chinese silk in the market, a significant decline in the silk weaving industry, reduced sales, and stockpiling of inventory. Silk filatures and merchants have been on the verge of bankruptcy, and most factories have ceased operations. This spring, the overseas market for Chinese silk has gradually improved. Various foreign firms in Shanghai have successively made purchases, resulting in a large number of domestic silk exports and a corresponding rise in prices.</p>
<p>Suspended Factories Reopen One After Another: Currently, the price of Grade B, 20-22 denier Chinese silk is approximately 500 yuan per bale (overseas) and 510 yuan per bale (domestic). This is an increase of about 100 yuan compared to the price in June. As a result, suspended factories have reopened one after another. In the four districts of Shanghai, Hongkou, Zhabei, Nanshi, and the concession, 33 silk filatures are operational, including Fu Chang, Yong Ji, Jiu Ji, Yuan Ji, Ji Yu, Hong Chang, and Xing Chang. There are 42 in Wuxi and 16 in Zhejiang. However, compared to the peak of 113 factories in Shanghai alone, this is only about one-third.</p>
<p>Prices Soar, Exports Surge: After prices soared, exports of Chinese silk surged. For example, in the first half of August this year, exports of Chinese silk were: (1) 1,580 bales to Europe, including 408 bales of waste silk, 5 bales of doupion silk, 76 bales of gray silk, 44 bales of yellow silk, 122 bales of Zhili silk, 99 bales of yellow filature silk, and 826 bales of white filature silk. (2) 1,731 bales to the Americas, including 104 bales of waste silk, 100 bales of gray silk, 70 bales of yellow silk, 216 bales of Zhili silk, 10 bales of yellow filature silk, and 1,231 bales of white filature silk. (3) 841 bales to India and other places, including 74 bales of white native silk, 454 bales of waste silk, 62 bales of doupion silk, 204 bales of yellow native silk, and 47 bales of white filature silk. The total is 4,152 bales.</p>
<p>Cocoon Inventory Dwindles, Raw Materials Scarce: Due to limited cocoon inventory, silk filatures in Shanghai are experiencing a raw material shortage panic. They are separately preparing to organize an agency to purchase autumn cocoons. However, because Zhejiang Province is implementing a unified control system, designating four districts where foreign merchants and silk merchants are allowed to purchase, the amount purchased is limited. The Shanghai Silk Filature Association has already sent a telegram to the Zhejiang Provincial Government requesting that the unified control system be lifted. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from Shanghai silk filature manufacturers yesterday that they only hope that Zhejiang Province will lift the unified control system and allow Shanghai merchants to freely purchase as much as possible. Otherwise, Shanghai factories will have no raw materials to reel and will be forced to suspend operations, indirectly affecting the livelihoods of workers and having a significant impact.</p>

Two months have passed without a response from the Ministry, and the new Stamp Tax Law is about to take effect. The association has recently submitted another request to the Ministry of Finance, reiterating its previous request to benefit depositors and avoid the risk of losing business.</p>

<p>The North China Daily News reports that Mr. Deshman, a staff member of the United Aircrafts Corporation of America, has recently traveled to the East to promote the company's business.

Mr. Deshman spoke about the future of aviation in China, saying that it is very promising, as China's roads have not yet been developed, and airplanes can be one of the most convenient methods of transportation. He also said that airplanes are improving every year, and the cost of flying is decreasing. Therefore, the cost of air travel is expected to gradually become cheaper. When asked about the possibility of an aviation route across the Pacific Ocean, Mr. Deshman replied that this ideal can definitely become a reality and will be very safe. Once the route is surveyed and the landing grounds are built, the aviation business across the Pacific Ocean will begin.

<p>The Central Cotton Adulteration Suppression Bureau of the National Economic Council's Cotton Control Committee, in order to facilitate communication and improve this year's work, convened a National Cotton Inspection Administrative Meeting yesterday (20th) at 9:00 AM.

<h3 id="e98">Post Office Unnecessary Display of On-Duty Personnel Names: Discussions with Standing Committee Members of the Postal Workers' Unions <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported a post office notice stating that post office employees should be humble and disciplined, and treat people with kindness. They would be implementing the display of office hours and the names of on-duty personnel to facilitate public interaction, etc. Yesterday, standing committee members of the Shanghai Postal Workers' Unions told a visitor that the post office has been established for more than thirty years and has never displayed the names of on-duty employees, yet employees have never treated the public with an unkind attitude. Moreover, if there are any complaints from the outside world about any postal employee, the postal authorities have always been able to investigate and impose appropriate punishment. Therefore, the implementation of this method of displaying the names of on-duty employees is superfluous. Furthermore, the Telegraph Bureau, Radio Station, and other state-run transportation agencies do not display employee names; they only use numbers to represent them. Since postal and telecommunications bureaus are in the same position and are governed by the same superior authority, such differences should not exist. Postal employees strongly oppose this method and have already requested that the Ministry revoke the order. At the very least, they should be allowed to use numbers instead, as is the practice at the Telegraph Bureau. Although the post office has already implemented the display of names, employees are still awaiting the final instructions from the Ministry of Transportation.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Silk and Satin Trade Association General Meeting <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silk and Satin Trade Association held its 6th General Meeting yesterday at the office of the Hangzhou Silk Group in Qianjiang Lane. Over two hundred member representatives were present, as well as Zhao Erchang, representative of the Municipal Party Department, and Yuan Hongjun, representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Luo Qinghua presided over the meeting, and after formal greetings, the chairman gave an opening address and reported on the association's activities. After the Economics Section reported on the financial situation, Chairman Luo Qinghua reported on the progress of promoting commercial acceptance bills. He stated that our silk and satin industry has traditionally relied on the silver and money shops for financing customer credit transactions. This practice has been in place for a long time. However, the silver and money shops are now tightening credit, leading to a depletion of resources and a difficult situation. Purely cash transactions are not easily reformed due to ingrained habits, and economic hardship is widespread. Customers everywhere cannot escape this situation. Therefore, changing the credit system to cash transactions is not feasible. In order to consider the interests of both buyers and sellers, the association believes that the use of commercial acceptance bills is the most appropriate solution. After several discussions with legal counsel and accountants, it was determined that this is in accordance with the new Negotiable Instruments Law promulgated by the Legislative Yuan. It was resolved to submit this proposal to the General Meeting for approval and to implement it simultaneously with the Electrical Machinery and Silk Weaving Industry Association from April 1st. Subsequently, because customers still did not fully understand the meaning and benefits of these bills, we invited representatives from the traveling salesmen to a joint meeting. It was resolved to have each representative organize a Commercial Acceptance Bill Promotion Committee to explain the process to each guild. It was also resolved to promote the procedure, starting with the Guangdong and Ningbo guilds as models for other guilds. At that time, those two guilds were hesitant and waited to see what would happen. After the representatives explained the situation and Qinghua personally contacted them, the Xulun Da Tong Hang and the Guangdong guild responded one after another, agreeing to comply. However, the Guangdong guild had some reservations regarding the time frame. The length of time and the number of bills could be negotiated by both the buyer and seller, which should not be a problem. During this time, the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau issued an order promoting the effort, and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Silver and Money Shops Association actively promoted it. Leaders and economic experts from all walks of life recognized that these acceptance bills were a credit tool that met the needs of the times and could alleviate the current economic difficulties. Therefore, various industries have followed suit. The industry has taken the lead in creating these bills, and all members have long been aware of their benefits, but they are still not widely used. This is due to the difficulty of changing old habits and a lack of self-motivation, which is regrettable. It must be understood that we are facing an unprecedented economic crisis, and we must work together to become self-reliant. Eliminating malpractices and innovating requires collective efforts and concerted progress to succeed. If we hesitate and wait, even good policies will be ineffective and we will inevitably perish. The promotion of these bills is simply a modification of the existing credit system, with the aim of increasing the turnover of the industry's capital while not hindering the convenience of each guild. If it can be universally implemented, it will not only alleviate the current economic panic but also greatly benefit the future development of industry and commerce. Financial leaders also believe that in this time of tight credit and increased panic, only the automatic creation of credit tools by the industry can save the situation. Therefore, they are happy to provide assistance and allow for acceptance and discounting of these bills. The Central Bank has also authorized commercial banks to rediscount them. Recently, the banking industry has begun to organize an acceptance house and is about to start issuing bank acceptance bills. Therefore, our colleagues in the association should strengthen their beliefs, continue their efforts, and complete the promotion of these acceptance bills to benefit the industry significantly. The next item was a discussion of proposals: (1) The Current Affairs Committee proposed that the government should reward foreign trade and properly determine the method for refunding raw material taxes on national silk. Resolution: Passed. (2) Luo Qinghua proposed that the government should establish a domestic artificial silk factory to prevent leakage and maintain the industry. Resolution: Passed. (3) Wang Zuyin proposed that a large sum of money should be raised for a large-scale national silk promotion campaign to awaken the attention of the people and save the decline of national silk. Resolution: Passed in principle, to be discussed by the Executive Committee. Subsequently, representatives from the Party Department and the Chamber of Commerce gave speeches, expressing their appreciation. The speeches were lengthy and are not recorded here.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Pin Zhen Jewelry Store Accused of Tax Evasion: Trial Begins: Customs Records Show Pin Zhen Did Not Import Goods: Court Approves Provision of Security to Avoid Seizure of Goods <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Pin Zhen Jewelry Store, located at 639 Nanjing Road, was found by the Jianghai Customs to be suspected of tax evasion. Customs officials, along with police officers, raided the store on the 12th of this month and seized diamond jewelry worth 70,000 to 80,000 yuan, which was then handed over to the First Special District Court for detention. This has been reported in this newspaper. The police station, in accordance with Article 21 of the Customs Anti-Smuggling Regulations, filed a public prosecution against the store's manager, Dong Shuyu. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhan Liangce of the First Special Court held a hearing in the Second Criminal Court. Dong Shuyu hired Fan Gang, Qin Liankui, and Ni Jiong as lawyers for defense. The police lawyer, Zhang Shizhu, stated that the Jianghai Customs had imported diamonds worth 17,736.11 yuan in customs gold, totaling 35,000 national currency, since 1920. However, Pin Zhen's imports this year alone have reached more than 40,000 yuan, exceeding the total imports by customs for the past five years by more than 6,000 yuan. The police also found two letters dated February 8 and March 14 of this year in the Pin Zhen store, both of which mentioned purchasing diamonds from Bombay, India. They also found eight telegrams, all related to remittances to Bombay, with very large amounts. However, there are no records of diamond imports by Pin Zhen in the customs records, indicating that they were indeed evading taxes. The police are continuing their investigation and request that the hearing be adjourned. When questioned, Dong Shuyu stated that all the letters and telegrams did not belong to the store. Pin Zhen was reorganized last year, and these items may have been left by the previous owners. Of the goods imported this year, more than 20,000 yuan were purchased from Uliwen, Buxing, Maji, and Beilaiheng Foreign Firms, and the rest were purchased from other companies in the market. According to jewelery industry practice, there are no receipts for these, and he submitted a letter from the Jewelery Industry Association to prove this. His lawyer, in accordance with Article 6 of the Anti-Smuggling Regulations, requested that the defendant be allowed to provide sufficient security to have the goods returned first. Judge Zhan, after reviewing the evidence, ordered the case to be adjourned because further investigation was needed. If the defendant could provide a security deposit of 75,000 yuan, the seized items would not be detained.</p>

<p>At 2 PM on the 10th of this month, Lu Genji Motor Transport Company, which was transporting bricks and tiles, had driver Jiang Asi drive a truck with four workers and the company's accountant, Shi Guoliang, to the Xiaoyang Bridge area of Jiaotong Road in Zhabei. Due to speeding, the truck accidentally hit and injured a pedestrian, Mr. Jia, who died on the spot. Jiang Asi and the others, realizing that they had caused an accident, had malicious intentions and attempted to move the body to destroy evidence. They lifted the deceased onto the truck, drove straight to Kuizhao Road in Jiangwan, pushed the body off, and drove away quickly, hoping that no one would know about the incident and they could evade responsibility. However, the Municipal Central District Public Security Bureau learned of the incident and detained several workers, including Hou Guisheng, and brought them to the bureau for questioning. Hou confessed that the accountant, Shi Guoliang, was hiding at 426 Alabaster Road. The Central District Public Security Bureau sent Detective Wang Yao, along with detectives from the Foreign Concession Police Station, to arrest Shi Guoliang. However, Jiang Asi was on the run. Shi was taken into custody at the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, presented the case, stating that this was an accessory case and that it was located with the help of the accomplice Hou Guisheng. An unidentified male corpse was found on Kuizhao Road in Jiangwan, who was found to have been crushed to death by a car. It was learned that at 2 PM on the 10th of this month, a truck from Lu Genji Motor Transport Company, with Foreign Concession license No. 16054 and Municipal license No. 12014, was driven by driver Jiang Asi to Jiaotong Road in Zhabei. Due to speeding, the truck hit a pedestrian. In addition to the driver Jiang Asi, the respondent Shi Guoliang and four workers were on the truck. They initially intended to send the injured person to the hospital, but he died as soon as they lifted him onto the truck. They then changed their plan and attempted to move the body to destroy evidence, throwing the body on Kuizhao Road in Jiangwan. He added that it should be questioned as to who did push the body. Then, accomplice Hou Guisheng testified that he was a worker on the truck that day. After hitting the pedestrian on Jiaotong Road, they lifted the injured person onto the truck and drove to a certain road in Jiangwan, where driver Jiang Asi and Shi Guoliang pushed the body off. When questioned, Shi Guoliang only admitted to being on the truck that day and denied pushing the body. Detective Wang Yao from the Central District Public Security Bureau then requested to take over the case for further investigation, and the police lawyer did not object. Judge Wu Zehan approved Shi Guoliang's transfer to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for questioning.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Changes in Reconciliation Terms for China Industrial Bank: Lu Xihou Sues Judge for Loss of Documents: Lawsuits Breed Lawsuits in This Entangled Case: Unprecedented Incident Arouses Great Concern from All Parties <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>After the China Industrial Bank collapsed on the day after the Double Tenth Festival last year, the bank's chairman, Lu Xihou, was prosecuted by the police station in the First Special District Court on charges of fraud and embezzlement. After repeated investigations, the court ruled to suspend the public prosecution and instructed Lu, in the name of the legal representative of the China Industrial Bank, to file a petition to liquidate all of the bank's accounts. The case was then transferred from the Criminal Court to the Civil Court, and Judge Yu Changzi of the Civil Court was assigned to handle the case. For several months, Judge Yu held several court sessions, summoning witnesses from both creditors and debtors for careful examination. Eventually, the parties reached a settlement out of court and proposed a settlement plan, which generally stipulated that the bank's debts, in addition to being repaid with the bank's assets, would be the responsibility of Lu Xihou to handle the shortfall. Lu then submitted the plan to the court for approval. However, Lu recently learned that the notice issued by the court to the creditors regarding the settlement plan contained descriptions of the settlement terms that were very different from those submitted to the court, with significant discrepancies. Therefore, Lu believed that the judge in charge of the case had acted improperly, causing him to suffer damages, and he could not remain silent. He has now filed a petition with the First Special Court to reclaim criminal jurisdiction. The reorganization of the formal court in the recovery of the law rights has never been seen in the past few years. What has happened today is the first time, and all parties are paying extraordinary attention to it. The Bureau of Public Works is particularly concerned and will send personnel to the court to record the proceedings during the public hearing. However, the parties involved do not want to expand the incident and hope that it can be resolved peacefully before the court hearing. However, after the court received Lu's complaint, it issued a summons, ordering the staff of the Hongkou police station, who are responsible for self-accusations, to send police officers to deliver the summons to the parties involved, ordering them to appear in court on time to defend themselves.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Lu Ruifang Requests Restoration of Father-Son Relationship: Leaves as a Child, Regrets as an Adult: Mediation Fails, Formal Lawsuit Filed <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Lu Weirong, the chief comprador of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., is a native of Ningbo Cixi and is over sixty years old. He lives at No. 5 Mingyu Lane, Jing'an Temple Road. He often contributes generously to charitable causes. Lu's first wife died of illness twenty-seven years ago, leaving behind a son named Ruifang, who is now thirty-five years old. (When his mother died, Ruifang was only eight years old.) He was raised by his grandmother. However, Lu has another concubine, with whom he has two sons and one daughter, all of whom have grown up and married. Therefore, after his first wife died, Lu married a certain Ms. as his second wife, who also has a daughter. However, the relationship between Lu Ruifang and his father, Weirong, is not very harmonious. Therefore, after Ruifang married in September of his eighteenth year, father and son clashed less than four months later and argued fiercely. On the eighth day of December of that year, Ruifang, unable to tolerate his father, took his wife out and rented a house elsewhere. In January of the following year, Lu's relatives came forward to draw up a severance agreement, and Lu Weirong published a statement in the newspaper, severing the father-son relationship with Ruifang. Since then, for more than ten years, father and son have had no contact. Recently, Lu Ruifang, due to his longing for his father, and because he was not yet an adult when the severance agreement was signed, hired lawyer Jia Yaoxi to file a petition with the First Special District Court for mediation, requesting the restoration of the father-son relationship and the cancellation of the severance agreement. The mediation petition stated that the applicant's father, taking advantage of the applicant's youth and lack of knowledge, was persuaded by his stepmother to force the applicant to leave the family. Since then, father and son have been estranged. For more than ten years, the applicant has longed to serve his father and enjoy his love, but has been unsuccessful. Therefore, he has no choice but to seek legal remedy to restore the relationship between flesh and blood, restore the father-son relationship, and declare the illegal documents signed by the applicant during his minority to be invalid. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang presided over the mediation of the case in the Eleventh Civil Court. As a result, the mediation failed, and the judge ordered a formal lawsuit.</p>

<p>Zhang Degui, a Yangzhou native, recently opened a rubber-soled shoe workshop at No. 52, Lujiabang Road, south of Malu Bridge in the southern part of the city. His business was quite prosperous, and he employed many partners and apprentices, including Zhu Deqing (18 years old) and Ni Zhongxin (19 years old), both from Yangzhou. These two were usually fond of playing and joking with each other, making it a common occurrence. One day before yesterday, around 7 PM, while they were having supper, because Zhang Degui, the shop owner, was out, Zhu Deqing, Ni Zhongxin, and others started another dispute. A tragic scene unfolded then and there. The other partners didn't think much of it. Unexpectedly, Ni Zhongxin kept nagging, and Zhu Deqing, being young and impetuous and of a rash disposition, picked up a bench and used it as a weapon. It hit Ni's nose. Ni, after being struck, became enraged. He seized the bench from Zhu Deqing's hand and struck Zhu Deqing's head in retaliation. Because he used excessive force, Zhu's skull was shattered, and he was injured. He immediately fell to the ground, his face turned pale, and he had only a faint breath. Soon, he died. The fellow partners, witnessing the great calamity, were all astonished. They immediately seized the assailant Ni Zhongxin and handed him over to the police on duty, who took him to the Wenmiao Road Police Station for temporary detention. Yesterday morning, Tao Yong, the 27th Ward bailiff, reported to the local court, requesting an autopsy. After receiving the report, the court immediately sent prosecutor Lei Binzhang, along with examiner Xuan Zhiming, to the scene to conduct the examination. They confirmed that Zhu Deqing had died from a fractured skull. They filled out the coroner's report and ordered Zhang Degui, the shop owner, to arrange the coffin and burial, pending the police station's interrogation and legal proceedings against the suspect Ni Zhongxin. It is said that the deceased's family is in their hometown of Yangzhou, with his father alive and his mother deceased, along with a young brother. Zhang Degui, the shop owner, has sent a letter urging the deceased's father to come to Shanghai to take care of everything.</p>

<p>Letter to the Hotel Industry</p>
<p>Honorary Chairmen Wu Tiecheng and Du Yuesheng, Chairman Wang Xiaolai, and Director Lin Kanghou specially sent a joint letter to the hotel industry yesterday, requesting them to promote tour tickets. The original letter reads as follows: "Respected sirs, this year, since the beginning of summer, continuous rain has caused floods, mountain torrents have erupted, the Yangtze River has flooded first, and the Yellow River has breached its banks later. The disaster area has reached more than ten provinces, and the affected victims number no less than ten million. If we do not find ways to rescue them, they will inevitably be displaced. Driven by conscience, we cannot bear to sit idly by. Therefore, we have organized the Shanghai All-Circles Relief Water Disaster Benefit Performance Assembly at the original site of the New World, combining charity with entertainment and raising funds through performances. The proceeds from the ticket sales will be used for disaster relief. However, we realize that this matter is of great importance, and unless we pool our efforts, we may not achieve significant results. We have always admired your company's enthusiasm for public welfare. At this time, when the hotel industry relies heavily on gifts to promote business, we dare to ask your company to promote our assembly's tour tickets, either by giving them as gifts to customers or by selling them on our behalf. Not only will your company's business develop further, but also the benefits to the disaster victims will be significant. It is truly a win-win situation. We believe your company will be happy to agree. Therefore, we are sending you tour tickets and hope that you will promote them or give them away to support this grand event. We look forward to your cooperation."</p>

<p>Chen Xiting's eldest son, Chen Xichu, a standing committee member of the Shanghai Citizens' Association for the Promotion of National Products and a passenger on the state-owned China Merchants Bureau's Xinjiangfutian Steamer, was a handsome and intelligent young man with outstanding academic achievements. After graduating from Qingxin Middle School two years ago, he showed great promise and had strong patriotic ideals. He was determined to study chemistry in depth, manufacture national products, save the country through production, and plug the leaks in our economy. He studied with Dr. Ye Hancheng, the director of the Wuzhou Gubend Soap Factory, and entered the factory as an intern. He had been there for three years, working diligently and gaining much knowledge. He was striving hard and achieving excellent results, earning the praise of his teacher and the admiration of his colleagues, and showing the glory of surpassing his predecessors. Last Sunday, as usual, he rested. Feeling the heat of the autumn tiger and the stuffiness of the city air, he invited his three colleagues, Qin Zhenqiu, _ Yuchun, and Shi Fuling, to ride bicycles west to get some fresh air. They first went to the Huang Family Garden in Caohejing for a short rest and then continued bravely until they stopped at Minhang Pubin Garden. Chen Xichu was fond of swimming. Seeing the refreshing west wind by the sea and the waves like a clear mirror, he was so excited that he immediately changed into his swimsuit and jumped into the water. Unexpectedly, he was stirred up by an evil tide and lost control. His colleagues were young and even more unfamiliar with swimming. They called for help, but he had already sunk to the bottom of the river. By the time he was fished out and brought ashore, there were no good facilities. It would be impossible to get a doctor from Shanghai and back within several hours. By the time the doctor arrived in Minhang, it was too late to save him. He died tragically, a handsome young man. Alas! Chen Xichu was only 21 years old. His relatives and friends were all grieved. However, his teacher, Mr. Ye Hancheng, wept even more bitterly. His body was transported back to Shanghai and laid in a coffin at the Dinghai Guild Hall. It is said that Chen's relatives, friends, and Chen Xichu's classmates will launch a memorial service to comfort his soul.</p>

<p>Zhou A'da, a 46-year-old boatman from Changshu, was sailing his boat near the Fuxin Flour Mill on Suzhou Road the day before yesterday. Due to the rapid currents, Luo Laiqing's pig boat and Gao Liansheng's watermelon boat approached and collided with Zhou A'da's boat. Zhou A'da was standing on the bow of the boat. Because he was not paying attention, he was knocked into the river. He did not surface and drowned. The neighboring boats tried to search for him in all directions but found nothing. As a result, the body was recovered and temporarily placed on the river beach. At the same time, the water patrol team arrested Luo Laiqing and Gao Liansheng, the two perpetrators, and took them to the team for questioning and temporary detention. Yesterday morning, Chen Quansheng, the bailiff of the 27th Ward, South 12th District, reported to the Procuratorate of the Local Court, requesting an autopsy.

<p>Liu Ying, a 20-year-old woman from Anhui, lost her mother when she was six years old. Six years ago, when she graduated from the Junior High School Department of Anhui Provincial First Girls' Middle School, her father also passed away due to illness. Liu, because of her poor family background, was unable to continue her education. She dropped out of school and became a primary school teacher in her hometown, using her income to support herself and her younger brother and sister. Liu has an elder sister named Manli, who married years ago and lives with her husband in Nanjing. Her brother-in-law is currently working in the political circles in Nanjing. During the winter vacation last year, Liu Ying felt that she had been living in her hometown for too long and it was difficult to achieve a better life and make progress. She packed her bags, said goodbye to her brother and sister, and came to Shanghai alone, intending to visit her old friend Lin Yuying, hoping to ask her for a job. Unexpectedly, when Liu arrived in Shanghai, Lin had already gone to Nanyang and they did not meet. Liu was greatly disappointed. Liu had no relatives or friends in Shanghai to turn to. If she returned to her hometown, it would be a futile and arduous journey. Seeing that Shanghai was a prosperous commercial city, she thought that if she waited for an opportunity, she could always find a position. Therefore, she stayed at the Shanghai Women's Apartment at the entrance of Sande Lane, Bubo Road in the French Concession, waiting for an opportunity. Who knew that after coming to Shanghai for half a year, she had asked around everywhere but found nothing. The money she had brought was also exhausted, and she owed the apartment for room and board, which she could not pay. Frustrated and helpless, she was pushed to despair and had the idea of suicide. So, the day before yesterday (the 19th) at 8 PM, Liu Ying walked to the French Company Wharf on the Bund and jumped into the river to kill herself. At that time, there were many people at the pier who witnessed Liu Ying jumping into the river and were shocked. They shouted for help. The boatmen next to the pier helped with the rescue. They used a pole to pull Liu Ying up as she floated after jumping down, and handed her over to the patrol police on the shore, who took her to the French Police Station for questioning and temporary detention. Yesterday morning, the police station ordered detectives to take Liu Ying to the Special Second Court to request instructions. At 11 o'clock, Judge Qiu Huanying came to the Criminal Court Eight to question her. First, lawyer Yao Zhaodi from the Police Department stated Liu Ying's rescue after attempting suicide and requested instructions on how to settle her. When Liu Ying walked into the courtroom, her face was full of sorrow, and she tearfully recounted her arrival in Shanghai, her life experiences, and her misfortunes. The judge advised her, "Suicide is the most painful and cowardly strategy in life. You should strive forward to seek progress." Liu replied, "I have been striving all along, but the result is always that there is no way out." During the interrogation in court, the audience was moved and felt sympathy for Liu. Lawyer Yao Zhaodi of the Police Department also asked Liu if she had taken the examination for primary school teachers before. Liu replied that when she was a teacher, there was no such regulation for examination. At this point, lawyer Yao indicated that he could find someone to arrange a suitable position for Liu. It was imperative to find a way to support Liu's life in the near future. At that time, a Ms. Chen in the audience heard Liu's pitiable background and felt compassion. She stood up and told the court that she was willing to temporarily adopt Liu. The judge then called Chen to the front of the case and asked her about her address and occupation. After questioning, Liu also expressed her consent. Liu then left with Ms. Chen.</p>

<p>Jin Juren, the manager of the Fuxinggong Rice Shop on Dajing Road, Xiaobeimen, had a customer named Hu Mingzhen, who lived at No. 224, Qinglian Lane, Qinglian Street, purchase seven loads of white rice a week ago, totaling eighty-odd dollars. He ordered the shop to deliver the rice and collect the payment. Because the rice needed to be weighed and the quality of the rice needed to be inspected, Jin ordered the shop clerk to deliver the rice, as Qinglian Lane was nearby. After Hu Mingzhen inspected and accepted the rice, he paid with a Tai Kang Zhuang bank draft dated August 18th and told the shop clerk that if the shop needed cash, they could discount the draft at the bank. Therefore, Jin Juren did not suspect anything. When the draft matured, he submitted it to the Xing Shanghai Bank for collection, but the Tai Kang Zhuang had already gone bankrupt and the draft was returned. Jin immediately went to Hu Mingzhen to demand payment, but Hu replied that he had already told the shop clerk to discount the draft immediately. He further claimed that the shop did not collect the payment on the 18th, but waited until the 19th, when the bank had already gone bankrupt. Hu refused to take responsibility and blamed Jin's company for the delay. However, Jin had already investigated and found that Tai Kang Zhuang had gone bankrupt long ago. As a result of the dispute, the police were called and they were taken to the Laobeimen Police Station for investigation. After questioning by Chief Shen, it was determined that the case involved a bad bank draft used to defraud food rice. The case was referred to the General Bureau for investigation and handling.</p>

<p>Jumping into the Sea</p>
<p>The Ningxing Steamer departed from Shanghai for Ningbo at 5 PM on the 17th. Not far from Wusongkou, around 6:30 PM, a young passenger suddenly crossed the ship's railing from the second-class deck and jumped into the sea. The ship immediately stopped to attempt a rescue, but the sea was vast and the person was already gone.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Belongings</p>
<p>Afterwards, the ship's steward found that the suicide passenger's berth was in the second-class deck, near the right side of the ship. He then inspected his berth and found a straw hat, a blue silk long gown, a five-dollar bill, a one-corner auxiliary currency coupon, and several cards, with "Lin Yongtang, Zhenhai, Zhejiang" printed on them, followed by the address "95, Seymour Road, Hua Feng Chang Tobacco Shop." There was also a note left for the steward, which read: "Please keep the remaining banknotes. Please send the gown and straw hat to Hua Feng Chang Shop."</p>
<p>Background of the Deceased</p>
<p>Because the next day was Sunday, the Ningxing Steamer docked in Ningbo. It began to set sail from Ningbo in the afternoon of the day before yesterday and returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. The aforementioned belongings have been sent by the ship's steward to No. 95, Seymour Road, Hua Feng Chang Shop, where they were received by his brother, Lin Yuntang (the shop owner).

<p>Ding Ye, a woman from Yancheng residing at No. 89 Ren Shou Lane, Bei Kai, lost her five-year-old son, Chang'an, at 7:30 AM on the 12th of this month while he was playing in the lane. Subsequently, Chinese Detective Li Hongsheng of the Yulin Road Police Station investigated and apprehended kidnappers Chen Yangen (from Changzhou), Ying Xiaolin (from Yixing), and Zhu Shouqing. Upon interrogation, they confessed that they had sold Ding's child to Chuan Chunshan, a man from Xuzhou residing at No. 144 Chuan Gong Road, Zhabei, to be his son. Zhu Baogen and others, who are currently at large, acted as intermediaries. Detective Li went to the address and found Ding's child, bringing him back to the police station. The child was returned to his mother. Chen and the other two criminals were sent to the First Special Court for trial and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xie Fen continued the hearing in the Third Criminal Court. Lawyer Wang Yaotang of the Public Works Department stated that Zhu Baogen had fled and was nowhere to be found. Currently, patrol officers from the Chuan Gong Road Public Security Bureau and the buyer, Chuan Chunshan, were present in court to testify. It was found that Chuan had been working at the British American Tobacco Company for over twenty years. Because he had no children, he asked his son-in-law, patrol officer Wang, to look out for a child to adopt. Zhu was said to be the source. Based on the testimony of Wang and Chuan, the judge questioned the defendants, who gave evasive answers. The judge sentenced Chen Tinggen, Ying Xiaolin, and Zhu Shouqing to three years of imprisonment each. The number of days they had been detained prior to the verdict would be counted, with two days of detention equivalent to one day of imprisonment.</p>

<p>The China Aviation Association was established in March of the 22nd year. Mayor Wu was invited to serve as the General Captain of the Solicitation Team to conduct an aviation fundraising campaign in the city. By June, 100,000 members had been recruited, and over 1.3 million yuan had been raised. In February of this year, a second fundraising campaign was launched in the city, with Mayor Wu again serving as the General Captain. However, due to the changed environment and the decline of the city's economy, the fundraising method was changed. In addition to recruiting members, group donations were also solicited from trade associations. In response to the needs of the environment, General Captain Wu specially dispatched staff member Zhang Yuliang to actively engage with various organizations. Agreements have already been reached, and implementation is underway. These include the hotel industry, fresh meat industry, fresh pork selling industry, shipping industry, mining industry, freight car industry, brick and ash industry, brick and tile transportation industry, and chicken and duck industry. The aviation donation drive is progressing smoothly, and the results are very impressive. The Sand and Gravel Industry Association also engaged in several consultations with Mr. Zhang Yuliang. Yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM, a general meeting was held at the association to establish the Sand and Gravel Industry Aviation Donation Fundraising Committee, which passed a resolution to raise 100,000 yuan for aviation donation. Collection began immediately. The city government issued a public notice for this donation and instructed the Public Security and Social Affairs Bureaus to effectively assist in the process. The committee members who attended yesterday were very enthusiastic.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Red Swastika Society: Investigation Report on the Yangtze River Disaster <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Following the occurrence of floods in various provinces along the Yangtze River, the general and branch societies of the Red Swastika Society immediately dispatched teams to the disaster areas for relief. At the same time, Li Cikai (Digguang) was publicly appointed as the representative of Chairman Wang Weiguan, and Xu Boquan as the representative of Chairman Zhou Zongliang, to lead staff members to the disaster areas along the river to conduct on-site investigations. The society has now received detailed reports of the disaster situation from the two special commissioners, Li and Xu. Excerpts are as follows: (Omitted above) In the counties near Wuhu, a vast expanse of water submerged all the ripe crops. The breached dikes were mostly small and medium-sized dikes. Larger dikes were fortunately preserved due to effective emergency protection. In Guanzhuang Dike in Tongling County, over 40,000 mu of farmland were breached and completely submerged, leaving 50,000 to 60,000 disaster victims without clothing or food, crying for help. In the Guangcheng Dike area of Anqing, many disaster victims gathered in makeshift reed sheds, suffering from hunger and disease, their cries of misery unbearable to hear. Furthermore, the Ma Hua Dike on Madang Mountain, at the border of Jiangxi and Anhui, collapsed, turning Susong and Wangjiang counties into watery realms. Anhui Province has suffered from drought and banditry for years, leaving many homes empty. Now, it has been hit by this great disaster, with all the ripe crops submerged. Alas, our compatriots will have nowhere to die. Traveling upstream, inspections along the north bank of the river revealed that eight out of ten dikes had been breached. The south bank, with its mountains and higher terrain, suffered less damage. This flood was initially caused by a downpour in Shaanxi, which flowed down to Jianli, causing the Xiang River to overflow and inundate the area from Xiangyang to Hanyang. In one day and night, several counties were submerged, with hundreds of thousands of people drowned, a truly unbearable tragedy. In the flood of the 20th year, the downstream was severely affected, while the upstream was less so. This year's flood, however, is extremely severe upstream and less so downstream. The team traveled by small boat along the Xiang River to Tianmen, passing through Caidian in Hanyang and reaching Hanchuan. There were dozens of breaches along the river. Climbing to the high ground in Hanchuan County, one could see nothing but water, as if standing outside Wusongkou and gazing at the ocean. This is the area bordering Tianmen County. As for Tianmen, Yicheng, Xiangyang, and Fancheng, all were covered in white waves, with extremely severe disaster conditions, truly a catastrophe. In total, 300,000 people in Hanyang, Hanchuan, and Tianmen counties cannot survive without relief, and 200,000 people in Xiangyang, Yicheng, and Zhongxiang counties cannot survive without help. Currently, the Wuhan Red Swastika Society has organized a relief office for the Hubei flood and, in conjunction with Red Swastika Societies and charitable organizations in various places, has already distributed 70,000 to 80,000 yuan for emergency relief. The society's relief team is still distributing emergency relief in Hanyang, under the leadership of Chairman He Hengfu, in cooperation with local flood relief organizations, dividing labor and coordinating efforts appropriately based on the urgency of the situation. The 4,000 bags of relief flour transported by the society will arrive in Hankou within a few days, and various medicines have also been received and distributed to the disaster areas for relief. Plans are now underway to provide emergency relief to the most severely affected areas in Xiangyang, Tianmen, and Fancheng. Broad beans are considered the most suitable relief grain, priced at 2.67 yuan per hundred catties. However, this is only a drop in the bucket and cannot solve the problem. It is hoped that more funds can be raised to save the people from disaster. It is also reported that the Southeast Joint Office of the society has scheduled a meeting of representatives from various provinces in Shanghai on the 22nd of this month to discuss relief methods.</p>

Tonight and tomorrow night, all the stars of the Star Film Company will hold an aviation charity performance at the La Fei Garden, which was proposed by Zhang Shichuan, captain of the 74th team, and Ms. Hu Die, captain of the 302nd team. All proceeds will be used to enhance the fundraising results. People from all walks of life are vying to purchase entrance tickets, and it is expected that the results will be very good. It is hoped that the field staff will think of more ways to assist the various teams in promoting their work to increase fundraising power. A small number of brick and ash transport vehicles are in arrears for aviation donations. After sending letters to the various branches of the Public Security Bureau to earnestly persuade them, they have actively made up the payments. In order to discuss all aspects of the ongoing strategy, the person in charge of the industry will be invited to the office for discussions on the 19th. The collection of donations from the fresh pork selling industry has been progressing excellently since it began, and the donations paid have been announced successively. Recently, the tenth installment of donations of 1,000 yuan was paid, and a letter of thanks has been sent for their efforts. The collection of aviation donations from various dance halls officially began on the 15th. All dance halls, large and small, throughout the city are handling this uniformly, and the results are excellent. All dance halls are enthusiastically supporting the effort, and people from all walks of life are eagerly donating, which is commendable. The first phase of the construction of the association's office and exhibition hall has been completed, and the second phase is half finished, which will consolidate the foundation of the association. After the field staff reported on the progress of negotiations, the meeting discussed several proposals regarding the ongoing strategy for soliciting donations.</p>
<p>The General Captain's Office yesterday sent a circular to all dance halls in the city, stating that Shanghai is a place where people from all walks of life gather, both good and bad. The staff members dispatched by the office all wear badges on their chests, which are round and have an airplane embedded in the center, with the name of the office engraved on the edge. They are also issued staff certificates with their photographs, signed and sealed by General Secretary Li Dachao. If staff members from the office come to negotiate with various dance halls or collect aviation donations on a per capita basis, please recognize the badge and request to see the staff certificate in order to prevent fraud and ensure caution. All dance halls in the city, including Formal Victory, Happy, International, Old General Association, Old Da Hua, Moon Palace, and Shun Feng, have begun officially. The results are better than expected. All dancers are voluntarily and enthusiastically donating. In addition to some being collected by the dance halls, the General Captain's Office directly dispatches staff members to handle the collection. Every night, several staff members are sent to various places for inspection. The owners and staff of the dance halls are working very hard to assist. Mr. Wang Xinhe, the owner of the St. Anna Garden, is particularly enthusiastic in supporting the collection of aviation donations. Since the trial began, the garden has collected more than 700 yuan in donations. Every night during the collection, the manager personally assists, showing great enthusiasm, which is truly commendable. It is reported that the General Team</p>

Zhu provided guidance beforehand, emphasizing the swift downstream currents and instructing Yu Shujian and Zhou Zhaohua to accompany the team members on the left and right sides, respectively, to prevent any unforeseen circumstances. After hearing the command, the participants entered the water. Initially, there was no clear separation, but after a period of swimming, positions began to emerge. Zhou Zhaohua showed great courage and led the group, setting an example for young swimmers like Ding Naixing, who also strived to follow closely behind, battling the river currents, moving straight without veering, and thus Zhou and others were the first to reach the finish line. The entire course, totaling 1,100 meters, was completed in 19 minutes and 20 seconds. Ding Naixing, Huang Guangrun, Tang Yunzhong, Qian Yunnan, Yao Jinli, Yang Bingfu, and others arrived successively.

<h3 id="e148">Ministry of Education Vigorously Implements Compulsory Education <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Personnel will be sent to various provinces and cities next month to supervise implementation</p>
<p>In order to actively promote compulsory education in all provinces and cities across the country, the Ministry of Education previously issued a circular by Minister Wang and instructed various provinces and cities to actively plan for implementation. The central government approved an appropriation of 240,000 yuan in the 24th year to subsidize the implementation of compulsory education in various provinces and cities. In addition, letters were sent to the Sino-British, Sino-French, Sino-Belgian, and Sino-American Boxer Indemnity Funds to request a subsidy of 800,000 yuan. At the same time, provinces and cities (including counties, local cities, and municipalities directly under the central government) were instructed to raise their own funds. Currently, with the exception of the Boxer Indemnity Fund subsidy, for which no definite allocation has been determined, the central government's subsidy of 2.4 million has been distributed to the provinces. The amount of self-raised funds has been generally determined. Most provinces and cities have had their self-raised compulsory education funding approved by the Ministry of Education, while a few are still under review. In order to further supervise and ensure the effective implementation of compulsory education in various provinces and cities in the 24th year, the Ministry of Education will send a large number of personnel to inspect various provinces and cities in September (after schools have started), and to supervise and guide the educational administrative authorities in the effective promotion of compulsory education. Even remote provinces are said to have personnel dispatched to them.</p>

<p>Temporarily Approves Registration of Chinese Schools and Handles Compulsory Classes. Na's Views on Concluding a Sino-Siamese Commercial Treaty</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Overseas Association received a telegram from overseas Chinese in Siam yesterday, stating that the Siamese government, in order to alleviate the Chinese rice ban movement, has dismissed Bai Shansebapan, the Minister of Education who most severely harmed overseas Chinese education, and transferred him to another position. Navy Captain Jian Xinxinchu Songkanchai was appointed as his successor. After the first group of Siamese inspection delegation returned to Siam, the delegation leader Na expressed his views on concluding a Sino-Siamese commercial treaty. The reporter of the Industry and Commerce News inquired about the situation, as follows:</p>
<p>Minister of Education Transferred to Another Position</p>
<p>Bai Shansebapan, the Siamese Minister of Education, was transferred to the position of Minister of Agriculture on August 1st. The vacant position of Minister of Education was filled by Navy Captain Luan Xinxinchu Songkanchai. According to those familiar with the situation in Siam, this change in the Minister of Education is considered to be closely related to Sino-Siamese issues. The former minister, Bai, was the most active in suppressing overseas Chinese education. In recent years, he unreasonably closed over a hundred Chinese schools, so overseas Chinese had no goodwill towards him. In order to alleviate the Chinese rice ban movement, in addition to temporarily approving the registration of Chinese schools and handling compulsory classes, Bai had to leave his post.</p>
<p>Na's Remarks After Returning to Siam</p>
<p>Two months ago, the reporter from the Chinese-language newspaper "Minguo Daily" visited the Chinese delegation. During the delegation's arrival in port, they had a brief conversation with delegation leader Na. Na first mentioned the warm welcome received from the Chinese government in Nanjing, then stated that Chinese civil groups and the press held quite radical views towards the Siamese government, making the atmosphere quite tense. Finally, Na expressed his opinion, believing that "the closure of schools is to maintain the dignity of the law, and the prohibition of Chinese newspaper personnel is also a matter of law enforcement." Regarding the conclusion of a Sino-Siamese commercial treaty, Na said that it should be handled in its entirety in order to have concrete measures. Regarding the so-called concrete measures, Na said, "Such as the determination of obligations and rights related to nationality, residence, industry, and legal rights. Chinese people have resided in Siam for a long time, and their treatment is no different from that of the Siamese people. After the conclusion of the treaty, the situation will be different." It is worth noting that Na is a second-class people's representative (i.e., appointed by the government) in the Siamese People's Assembly and the secretary of the People's Party Club, holding a considerable position. His remarks are worthy of our attention.</p>

<p>Hui Sheng Midwifery</p>

<p>Ningbo Native Association Primary Schools</p>
<p>The Ningbo Shanghai Native Association has always been extremely diligent in promoting educational work, particularly in primary education. Recently, in light of the large number of out-of-school Ningbo children in the Hongkou area, the original No. 2 and No. 8 schools are insufficient to accommodate them. Therefore, two mu of land have been rented in the area of Gongping Road, Dongyouheng Road to build a new three-story Western-style building for the second primary school. The groundbreaking ceremony for the construction project was held in the conference hall of the association. School board members Fang Jiaobo, Zhang Jiguang, Zhang Shenzhi, and Wu Yaqin all attended to supervise the opening of bids. As a result, the construction was contracted to the Shanyiji Xing Construction Company. The contract was signed, with completion scheduled for the end of this year. The new school building will accommodate over a thousand students in the future. The Seventh Primary School was re-established on Meibike Road last year. The school board of the Ninth Primary School has recently decided to re-establish it in 1935.

Although the number of graduates in the third session will only be known after the second graduation examination in September, most of the students in the third session have already received pre-employment offers from various parties because the first and second sessions of graduates have been able to competently fulfill their duties. The Ministry of Education subsidized 10,000 yuan last year (1934) to fund the school's research expenses, and funds have been allocated this year as well. The Shanghai French Concession Municipal Council's special subsidy has also been renewed this year.

Twenty students have already been admitted in the first round. The second round of new student examinations will be held on the 26th of this month, and registration has already begun.

<p>— Original work by American author Louisa May Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang (Zonghai)</p>
<p>"Dicky's trouble was having a crooked spine, but he bore his affliction so cheerfully that Jo asked him one day, with her odd bluntness, 'Does being a hunchback give you a good temper? If it does, I'd like one.' Dick was always glad to join in the play with the other children, and to be as happy as they were, for he had a brave spirit in his small body. He had at first been very sensitive about his misfortune, but he had soon forgotten it, and no one dared to mention it to him, for Mr. Bhaer had severely punished a boy who laughed at him.</p>
<p>'God doesn't mind it, for though my back is crooked, my heart is straight,' Dick had said to his tormentor, and Mr. and Mrs. Bhaer had taken the hint, and soon made him believe that they loved him for his heart, and did not care what his body was like, except to pity him, and help him to bear his affliction.</p>
<p>One day, while playing 'Noah's Ark,' some one asked, 'What are you going to be, Dick?'</p>
<p>'Oh, I'm the one-humped camel; can't you see my hump?' was his laughing reply.</p>
<p>'Just so, my good child, that isn't to carry a load, only to go ahead of the others,' said Jo, who was arranging the queer menagerie of lions, tigers, dragons, and snakes.</p>
<p>'I hope others will be kind to the poor afflicted boy, and I think my children have already learned that,' said Mrs. Bhaer, pleased to see the success of her teaching. Dick was hobbling past her at the moment, looking like a very happy, though a very small, camel, beside the strong 'Tommy,' who was strutting along like a very grand elephant."</p>

<p>It was anticipated that the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) would list its rates with the pound sterling unchanged and the US dollar rising by 0.0625, but there was still demand. Sassoon also requested a major buy-in. However, because banks were still trading with each other, the process remained stable. Although Chinese merchants' sentiment did not improve after the buy-in, the exchange market lacked volatility due to interbank trading. The Hong Kong market also softened. It was predicted that the Indian silver coin would be at a slight discount, but this had little impact.</p>

<h3 id="e164">Silver Dollar Withdrawals Make Period Slightly Busy <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai commercial sector has been reluctant to release funds for circulation from the gold and silver markets, it has been more than half a year, and the market has been bitterly astringent and difficult to describe. Recently, due to government assistance to the native banks, there has been a slight increase in circulation. Generally reputable and well-established firms have also benefited somewhat, but it is still considered a drop in the bucket, insufficient to solve the major problems. Therefore, commercial sentiment is stagnant, and the procedures for managing the funds were particularly busy yesterday compared to the usual.</p>
<p>However, there was still no change in the interest rates for silver dollar loans in the market. Both the morning and afternoon rates were at one jiao (角), with the agreed rate still not increased, and the actual rate was excessively lenient and unmeasured. The exchange rate was lacking, and the agreed rate was too high, even to the point of having to pay extra for transportation, which shows that the current market situation is not something that people can predict.</p>
<p>The volume of transactions for call loans reached 3,670,000 in the morning and more than 200,000 in new transactions. In the afternoon, transactions were over 400,000, and at the Small General Association, transactions were over 300,000. The volume of silver dollar collateralized loans is now sparse, and the amount of recalls is high, as most have expired, resulting in a higher amount. Yesterday, another 700,000-800,000 was made, while only more than 400,000 was lent out. The amount of banknotes recalled was over 800,000, the amount of issued marked bills was over 400,000, and the amount of circulating bills was over 600,000.</p>
<p>The source of customers' funds was 100,000, while withdrawals were 200,000. The surplus from foreign banks' export settlements was over 1,500,000, while the surplus from Chinese banks' export settlements was over 1,200,000. According to insiders, the current trade surplus can offset the sharp decrease in imports.</p>
<p>Bank withdrawals: foreign banks' withdrawals of bills were over 2,900,000, various goods exchange collateral loans were 4,340,000, telegraphic transfers were over 700,000, foreign exchange settlements were over 900,000, special transfers were over 800,000, and withdrawals from warehouses were 1,100,000.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw an initial firmness followed by weakness. The environment leaned towards stability in the political situation, leading to a continued short squeeze. In terms of chips, No. 48 seemed to be coming out, leading to a softening. Arbitrage trading on the floor was still quite active, so the far-term market remained depressed. Buyers were mostly No. 11, 34, and 54, while sellers were mostly No. 21 and 48. However, No. 458 only sold at high prices and did not dump indiscriminately. The trend was for the long positions of No. 48 to mostly graft onto other positions, gradually exiting, so there wouldn't be a rerun of a squeeze. Short positions were shaky. If arbitrage trading remains active, a short squeeze is still possible.</p>
<p>The situation yesterday was that only the early trading in the morning was relatively firm, rising 2 or 3 jiao (角). The second round saw chaos, with highs and lows. The afternoon opening was good for the front positions by about 1 or 2 jiao (角), but the back positions softened by about 1 jiao (角). The closing was slightly weak, falling slightly by 1 or 2 jiao (角). However, the whole number 6 turned strong again. The market price result was slightly better by 2 or 3 jiao (角). The total turnover was 13,565,000 yuan. The results of the increases and decreases are compared in the table on the left (unit: 100 yuan per transaction unit).</p>

<p>The New Asia Trading Company reported that yesterday (19th), the New York stock market saw a sharp drop due to the House of Representatives passing the Guffey Coal Act. There was fear that all the proposals requested by President Roosevelt before Congress adjourns would be passed, leading to a mass sell-off. The force of the decline was the worst since May. There were also rumors that there was hope for compromise on the public utilities proposal, leading to a large-scale dumping of public utility stocks. At the same time, the House of Representatives passed the Railroad Retirement Act, so railroad stocks were heavily sold off. The price market was mixed and weak. The small exchange market followed the decline, with public utility stocks falling the most. The total volume of trading for the day was 2,070,000 shares.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Yarn and Cotton: Weak Sales Affect Speculative Yarn <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to decline, and the situation became more and more depressed. This was because although the economic situation was more active than before, the situation in the mainland was not yet very comfortable, and there was no active purchasing power for existing yarn. However, when the market price was low, customer demand picked up. When the Tianjin merchants saw the price of existing yarn rise, they sold it. The Sichuan merchants, who were enthusiastically purchasing the day before yesterday, stopped for two days. However, general operators pulled in quite strongly. There was no shortage of new yarn delivered this month.</p>
<p>New yarn delivered to warehouses</p>
<p>Speculative yarn market opened lower for all months, and the situation suddenly turned weak. This was because there were another 16 bales of a certain yarn delivered to the warehouse this month. It was said that 20-count Shepherd and Tianguan yarns were all delivered. Although there were many rumors of preparing to take delivery, the market sentiment remained dissipated. In addition, customer yarn sales became quiet again, so the number of buyers in the market decreased. Gold prices continued to fall, and gold merchants also sold, making the market even weaker. As a result, each month fell by 0.5, 0.6, 0.8 jiao (角) to 1 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price.</p>
<p>The afternoon opening saw Tianjin merchants sell off existing yarn, and Sichuan merchants remained inactive. The situation remained depressed, but generally, the industry was optimistic and bought in. At the closing, short positions covered, and Tongcheng Company came to buy in again, rising 0.2 or 0.3 jiao (角). As a result, each month fell by 0.2 jiao (角) compared to the morning closing price. Sold: Hengyi 450 bales, Yida 1,250 bales, Jinchang 400 bales, Taixing 300 bales, Gengfeng 800 bales, Taichang 300 bales, Runkang 1,450 bales, Mingde 700 bales, Zhenda 400 bales, Changfeng 700 bales, Yongchang 400 bales. Bought: Dafu 1,400 bales, Yuda 1,150 bales, Hengde 400 bales, Renfeng 1,250 bales, Gengfeng 700 bales, Runkang 550 bales, Hengchang 750 bales. The highest, lowest, and closing prices of the day are as follows:</p>
<p>The Hot Sales Situation Vanishes Again</p>
<p>The sales of existing yarn have turned sluggish again. Statistics show that all merchants bought a total of 463 bales for the whole day. The market conditions were similar to the previous day. The purchase amounts of each merchant are as follows: Mainland 250, Guangdong 105, Shantou 20, Hankou 1, Jiangxi 30, Changsha 13, Ningbo 1, Nanjing 3, Trade 40.</p>

<p>The new cotton situation in the cotton market is very weak. Because the weather has been good recently, the new cotton is in the middle of tight season, and the climate is very important. According to the current situation, the future is still optimistic. The cotton production situation in our country, the China Cotton Industry Statistics Association released an estimate yesterday, the national amount is 19,596,684 dan (担), a decrease of 900,124 dan (担) compared with 10,497,924 dan (担) at the same time last year, so the market sentiment is weaker.</p>
<p>Speculative Cotton: Surface Loosens</p>
<p>The speculative cotton market opened sluggish in the morning for August. However, most opinions said that there were not many deliveries, but compared with then, it has already risen by 6 yuan, which cannot be considered little in the current environment. As for the new cotton, it is benefiting from favorable weather, and the situation is loosening. The Ningbo merchants are套出selling because Hefeng in that area has suspended operations and the Yao cotton production prospects are good. The surface has been loosening recently. As a result, each month fell by 0.15 jiao (角) to 0.25 jiao (角) compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The afternoon opening saw the market state still tired and weak. The Indian cotton market was quite weak, and the decline intensified. As a result, each month fell by 0.05 jiao (角) to 0.1 jiao (角) compared to the morning closing price. 香 Sold: Yuda 1,900 dan (担), Mingde 900 dan (担), Yukang 1,600 dan (担), Gengfeng 1,100 dan (担), Changfeng 2,500 dan (担), Yifeng 1,700 dan (担), Hexing 1,700 dan (担), Taixing 1,100 dan (担), Senkang 1,000 dan (担), Tonghe 800 dan (担).

The highest, lowest, and closing prices of the day are as follows.</p>
<p>Small Factory Demand Continues</p>
<p>The consumption of existing cotton is still good. Factories still have sporadic needs. The sources are: Yao cotton 1,262 bales, Tong cotton 314 bales, Tianjin American cotton 46.25 large进件entered the factory 8 pieces of spot goods sent to the factory Hankou fine velvet 42.50 Sulun entered the factory 177 pieces of spot goods sent to the factory Lingbao cotton 4700 Shenxin entered the factory 8 pieces of spot goods sent to the factory and 41.50 Yongan entered the factory 150 pieces of spot goods sent to the factory China Cotton Industry Statistics Association announced on August 20th at 5 pm</p>

<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened with poor news from Liverpool, and foreign and Southern merchants sold, with all months falling by 11 to 14 pounds. Then, traders and Wall Street bought, short positions covered, and brokers bought the March period, and the market price rebounded. Washington officials predicted that there would not be a loan announcement today, and Southern senators said that if it was delayed again, it would raise doubts about the loan and the market would be easily affected by rumors. The closing was stable, with spot prices unchanged and futures rising or falling by 1 to 4 pounds. British cotton spot prices fell by 4 points, and futures rose by 2 or 3 points. Indian cotton initially rose due to slight purchases by European exporters, but later softened due to weak silver prices, the 　ing of futures traders, and the closing of long positions. It is estimated that Pingguo尔fell by 2.25 rupees, Aomulafel by 3.5 rupees, and Bairo溪fell by 2.25 to 2.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram on the 19th).</p>

<p>Yesterday, the crystal flour market saw foreign wheat quotations fall by 1 or 2 jiao (角) in Chicago and 1 jiao (角) in Canada. The market sentiment was that because actual sales were not moving, speculative trading inside and outside the industry was mostly waiting and watching, so the activity was very calm, roughly similar to the previous month.迫Until the afternoon opening, each month saw a slight weakening, because customers were very懈unwilling to enter this month. For the forward months, the factories continued to hedge, so the asking price loosened again. According to the observation of people in the industry, although the removal of the products is not smooth this month, the factory still intends to maintain, so the lower limit has felt limited. As for the forward term, because the number of chips has increased, there will be a slight trend in the future. As a result, this month was slightly lower by 0.5 points, September was slightly lower by 0.75 points, October was slightly lower by 0.5 points, November was slightly lower by 0.15 points, and December and January were slightly lower by 0.5 points.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market was weak, and foreign wheat quotations continued to fall by 1 or 2 jiao (角). As for the industry's sentiment, although domestic wheat has arrived, it is still only sporadic in recent days. However, the factories have new foreign wheat imports, and flour sales have not been robust recently, so futures wheat naturally have no intention of using 神. Even existing goods did not enter the market after the small decline. In this case, the standard decline is also an unavoidable fact. There were not many transactions in each session, and prices generally tended to soften. As a result, this month fell by 0.2 points, September to November fell by 0.3 points, and December fell by 0.5 points.</p>
<p>In the existing wheat market, the northern market was closed and did not open. Although the southern market opened for a few thousand bags, the especially high-quality goods generally had a low of 3 or 5 points. In this case, it is feared that it will fall another point.</p>

<p>It seems that the world is full of dead people who are not good. The eulogy in the obituary is to say good things for the scapegoat. The inscriptions of celebrities are to praise the dead. It seems that the death of such a person is a major loss to the country. No matter how the deceased was scolded before his death, as long as he is rich, he can always ask for praise from others. He was a local tyrant before his death, but the words "Down with local tyrants" will never be found in the obituary. So I always think that it is always good to die.</p>
<p>A young man who has just entered society is like a rough stone, showing a strong spirit of resistance. After hitting a wall, it is as if the stone corners are gradually being worn away. By the time the stone corners are gone, the ambition has been exhausted.</p>
<p>"For the sake of my father getting old, for the sake of my stomach getting hungry, otherwise I really don't want to come to society to see such unbearable ugliness." These are a few indignant words in a friend's letter, but I think that the various ugliness displayed in society are exactly the philosophy of life that cannot be found in books.</p>

<p>— Zhang Muliang</p>
<p>This is a road leading directly from Avenue Joffre to New Shanghai. The noise and clamor throughout the day are enough to reveal its true and weary state.</p>
<p>When the sun has just shot its powerful rays from the clouds, everything on Qimei Road has already begun its lively and noisy performance!</p>
<p>Private cars, company cars, school buses from various universities, and tall, cumbersome freight trucks, one after another... trailing wisps of green smoke behind them, scurrying along the asphalt-paved spine of Qimei Road. And there are also those Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau dung carts, clattering and rumbling. So, the mornings on Qimei Road are only filled with these things spiritedly intertwined.</p>
<p>At the entrance to Qimei Road, there are many "Bent Waist Brand" cigarette stalls, using the packaging of brands like "Beautiful Brand," "Golden Mouse Brand," "Company Brand," etc., but inside they are filled with their own manufactured "Bent Waist Brand" cigarettes, neatly stacked in packs. They often tout their wares to rickshaw pullers, laborers, and other such figures, saying: "Hey! These cigarettes are top-notch, only five coppers a pack..."</p>
<p>This can be said to be a major stronghold for people from Jiangbei. They are used to being "Big Good Guys," and if they encounter timid people, they will drag you to a teahouse to reason with you, and incidentally fleece you!</p>
<p>The shops here are lined up along the front of Qimei Road. Several shops have installed those captivating radios to attract customers, but only a few listeners can be seen in front of their stores.</p>
<p>On both sides of the First Qimei Road Bridge, there are many settlements of impoverished people from Jiangbei. Most of them live in simple thatched huts, but quite a few also use boats as dwellings. The stench from all directions here penetrates people's noses with the wind, and that smell is terribly uncomfortable!</p>
<p>From the Second Qimei Road Bridge onward, a completely rural scene unfolds. The fields are filled with green, red, yellow... these colors dotting Qimei Road, as if it were a beautiful painting. Further on, towards the city center, it's another scene entirely.</p>
<p>When government agencies and other institutions dismiss their offices, their cars are mostly active on Qimei Road, taking office staff back home.</p>
<p>When the sun is close to the horizon, streetlights on Qimei Road light up as if by tacit agreement. The flat Qimei Road lies quietly under the half-lit, half-dark streetlights.</p>

<p>Chapter Seventeen: Do Not Ask a Woman's Body, Hard to Speak of Hidden Pain, Strive to See the Face of a Noble, Together Admire High Moral Character</p>
<p>Some of the more inquisitive travelers asked the porters carrying luggage, "What official business does the commissioner have coming to the Northwest?" The porter casually replied, "Investigating cases." Hearing this, and recalling that his face was as dark as the bottom of a pot, resembling Bao Zheng, everyone guessed that this person must be "clearer than the Yellow River" and worthy of a look for his incorruptibility. So, they all waited eagerly at the road entrance. Everyone thought that in a place like Xi'an, which had suffered from drought and war, its vitality had not yet recovered, there probably weren't any major cases that would require a central official to investigate. However, since a central official had come, one couldn't say there was absolutely nothing. Therefore, besides curiosity, they also really wanted to see what a noble person looked like. Around four o'clock in the afternoon, the sound of car horns echoed in front of the hotel, signaling that Commissioner Lan had arrived. The few welcoming personnel who had arrived earlier rushed to the hotel entrance to greet him. Zhang Jiefu, with sweat pouring down his face, also followed to the main entrance. At this moment, Mr. Zhang's enthusiastic welcome also reached Zhiqian's ears. He felt that this matter was somewhat unusual, and although he disdained joining such a bustling crowd, he couldn't help but follow the murmuring crowd and slowly walked out. When he reached the front of the hotel, it happened that Commissioner Lan was getting out of the car. The people who had come to admire the commissioner mostly imagined that, while not necessarily having the dark face of Lord Bao, he must be a tall and sturdy official with both literary and martial bearing. But when the representatives dispersed and revealed Mr. Lan, he turned out to be an old man in his fifties, with a thin, angular face, prominent cheekbones, and temples already gray under his hat. He wore a copper-colored silk padded robe, which arched his back high, and his steps were less than a foot long, revealing his slowness. (295)</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Because the colors of roses cannot be exactly the same for millions of flowers; even on the same flower, the petals often vary in shade; if petals of different shades are collected together and crushed into a liquid, it will be difficult to obtain a bright, even-colored rouge; at least it cannot be compared to a fresh rose with a very normal color. Therefore, after picking many roses, we must inspect them one by one, only picking off the petals with normal colors for use, and discarding all the rest; this selection work is not only time-consuming, but also cannot be done by a novice without experience..."</p>
<p>As she said this, I immediately understood why I often saw several eunuchs in a certain side hall, carefully picking rose petals around a large bamboo basket as if searching for treasure, it turned out they were for making rouge!</p>
<p>"After enough normal-colored rose petals have been selected," the Empress Dowager continued to explain with relish, "they are then placed in a clean stone mortar and slowly pounded, until the petals become a thick paste; then they are filtered through a fine gauze filter to completely remove all impurities, resulting in the clearest flower juice, and then begins the most important part of making rouge..."</p>
<p>There have always been several squares of bright red silk cotton on the Empress Dowager's dressing table, which I have long known; at this moment, she picked up one at random and lightly cut off a very small piece with a pair of small gold scissors. (395)</p>
<h3 id="e181">The Front and the Back <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>Feeling particularly bored, I picked up a copy of "Dream of the Red Chamber," and it happened to be the section where Uncle Rui was looking at the Fengyue Mirror. After reading it once, I suddenly felt a sense of enlightenment.</p>
<p>I remember just the day before yesterday, a friend said to me, "If you see a pleasing woman on the street with an alluring figure and rich curves, it's best to follow her closely, admiring her from behind, but you must never go in front of her and look back at her face. Because when you look from behind, you can idealize her beauty. But if you look at her face, nine times out of ten, you will be disappointed. You must know that in all the world, perfect beauties are so rare that you might not find one or two in ten thousand."</p>
<p>At the time, I listened to his profound argument without committing myself. Now, comparing it to the theory of the front and back of the Fengyue Mirror, I couldn't help but suddenly understand my friend's profound argument.</p>
<p>However, after thinking carefully, I feel that my friend's words are incorrect. Look, the Fengyue Mirror shows the enchanting Wang Xifeng when viewed from the front, and an empty, hollow skeleton when viewed from the back. The author's painstaking advice is to persuade people to understand that beauty is a skeleton, and a skeleton is beauty. Now my friend is still advising me to imagine the beauty of a woman's face by looking at her back, wouldn't that be like imagining the beauty of Wang Xifeng while looking at the skeleton on the back of the Fengyue Mirror? Wouldn't that be hastening one's own demise?</p>
<p>Therefore, I think that when you see women with attractive backs on the street, you should treat their backs as the front of the Fengyue Mirror, and rush to the front to look at their faces. Because there are no perfect beauties in the world, and although the face of a woman with a slender figure may not be a skeleton, it may be a ghastly woman. If you can regard this ghastly woman as a skinless, fleshless skeleton, then that would naturally be even more thorough. This is what is called reflecting the Fengyue Mirror from the back.</p>

<p>In the lower classes of Shanghai society, the most prevalent forms of English are two: Pidgin English and Russian English. This is not a universal phenomenon, but it is the case for the lower classes of Shanghai and for Russian émigrés.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, we often hear a kind of Pidgin English in circulation:</p>
<p>He is he, me is me,</p>
<p>Is is yes, is is no.</p>
<p>At the same time, we may also hear Russian émigrés begging for coppers on the street, using a kind of Pidgin English to say to you: "Chinamanisgoodman," meaning that Chinese people are good people. But this kind of English is inevitably shallow and laughable.</p>

<h3 id="e183">Emergency Treatment for Insect Stings and Snake Bites <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Bingyu</p>
<p>Emergency Treatment for Insect Stings: In hot weather, various pests breed very quickly, and our bodies are often harmed by them. Therefore, we should know the methods of emergency treatment for everyday life at home. (1) When stung by bees or gadflies, apply tobacco oil from a dry tobacco pipe to immediately relieve pain, or apply the juice of sweet potatoes or morning glory leaves. (2) When bitten by centipedes or millipedes, crush the leaves of knotweed or soybean leaves and apply the juice to the affected area to relieve pain. If ineffective, rub with plum flesh for remarkable results. (3) When stung by dragonflies, wash with vinegar to disinfect. (4) When stung by slugs, the skin swells; apply sesame oil to reduce swelling and remove toxins. (5) When bitten by bedbugs, apply Opodeldoc containing ammonia, but undiluted ammonia is very strong and causes skin pain. You can ask the pharmacy to prepare the following mixture: (10 grams of ammonia, 10 grams of clear water, 2 grams of menthol, 1 gram of camphor, 70 grams of alcohol). (6) When stung by mosquitoes, crush salt and chrysanthemum leaves to extract juice and apply it; the pain and itching will stop immediately. (7) For stings from other poisonous insects such as hairy caterpillars and gnats, knotweed leaf juice can be used to relieve pain. Generally, doctors mainly use persimmon juice, mint, ammonia water, etc. If the skin is swollen and red, lead sugar water (i.e., aluminum acetate) must be used. It is now summer, and everyone suffers from mosquitoes, but the reactions to mosquito bites vary depending on individual constitutions. Some people's skin immediately becomes red and swollen after being bitten, while others do not. We must not scratch the itch, because if scratched, it can easily fester. You can usually go to the pharmacy to buy the following medicines: one is antipruritic lotion, which consists of 2 grams of carbolic acid, 1 gram of menthol, and 100 grams of alcohol; the second is decongestant ointment, which consists of 15 grams of zinc oxide, 1 gram of carbolic acid, 5 grams of Mucelago Tragacanthae, 2 grams of Glycerinum, and 8 grams of water.</p>
<p>Treatment for Snake Bites: There are many types of venomous snakes, the most dangerous being the viper, but the severity of the injury depends on the climate at the time of the bite and the symptoms of poisoning. If the bite is near the heart, immediately tie the bitten area tightly with a rope to prevent the flow of arterial blood, then cut open the bitten area and use your own mouth to suck out the venomous blood, and apply caustic potash. Also use a 5% solution of potassium permanganate to rub the area near the bite, and then inject 1% Calcaria Chlorala before loosening the tied area. Finally, bandage with cotton soaked in a 0.01% Cresloi Saponatu solution. For local treatment, immediately drink alcohol to stimulate excitement after being bitten, and give camphor injections Camphosa Depurata, Drgitalis, and other heart stimulants, or use diaphoretics, diuretics, or large amounts of glucose solution and Liqucr Pingeni injections to dilute the toxins in the body through circulation. There is also a very simple method: wash the area locally with fresh persimmon juice, because persimmon juice can neutralize snake venom.</p>

<h3 id="e184">Decadence in Modern Literature <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Meiyu</p>
<p>In modern English literature, Lawrence's mysticism and Joyce's psychoanalysis can naturally represent the characteristics of English bourgeois literature. Lawrence's works almost all involve issues of sexuality, and he emphasizes psychological analysis; however, what he writes is not conscious, nor subconscious, but unconscious; that is to say, he omits descriptions of normal psychology and only describes those unconscious thoughts that are suppressed deep within the heart (which is greatly related to the emphasis on sexual issues in the subject matter). As for Joyce, in Radick's words, he believes that the artist's task is to take a photograph of a dung heap through a microscope; he admits that the writer should write like a slow-motion film, scene by scene, regardless of whether the action is mental or physical, until it ends. He does not realistically represent real life in his works, but simply throws up some trivial, unrelated things, and patches them together to be finished. His representative work "Ulysses" and J.V. Woolf's "Mrs. Dalloway" both use a book to write about the protagonist's psychology in a single day, walking a step, saying a word, the thoughts of smoking a cigarette are all written in the book. (Here we may as well add that Lawrence, Joyce, Woolf, and T.S. Ehot are collectively known as the four giants of the current English literary scene.) Similarly, the French novelist Proust also has the same tendency; he carefully describes some of the most irrelevant actions, and with his special—French bourgeois and the most special part of the aristocracy—the smallest number of figures in a dominant position with extremely fine descriptions, but in this respect, he touched the unparalleled depth and breadth. Thus, we know that these writers all have this kind of trump card, and in writing, they all play with this kind of mystery; but the method of psychoanalysis, when it was discovered at the beginning of the nineteenth century, was originally used as an extremely clever tool to dissect and understand life, but today it is used by them to cover up and embellish the heroic appearance of living reality.</p>
<p>Naturally, this attitude of theirs in creation has its social basis. When the bourgeoisie retreats from progress to conservatism and gradually declines, when the freedom of art, the stubbornness of creative thought, the possibility of the existence and development of transcendent literature, and the independence of literature from society and politics are all passionately advocated and supported, many writers unconsciously narrow their scope of observation of real life, abandon its broad and comprehensive research, and stop at the "solitude of their own souls," and then, due to a lack of real-life knowledge, the deepening and stubbornness of self-thought, they hide in the fruitless attempt to "know themselves." Thus, individualism is transformed into egocentrism. This is the reason for the decline of bourgeois literature in the twentieth century, and the reason for the production of these declining works, and the reason why we call this type of writer decadent.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we say that these writers are decadent because their works, whether good or bad, can only be produced when a certain culture reaches its declining period. This type of work is not only produced today, but also in the declining periods of various cultural stages in history. We usually call it "Byzantinism," and this term fully reveals this meaning. As for us calling them decadent writers, it is not to say that Joyce, Proust, etc. are not great writers. On the contrary, because this decadence itself has its active aspects; like Joyce, etc., they have reached an unprecedented height in analytical intelligence and sensitivity. This is just as Hegel said: "The owl of Mineva (the goddess of wisdom) flies at night." The afterglow of the setting sun of each culture is sometimes more lovely than anything else about it.</p>
<p>However, are there differences between the works of writers such as Shakespeare, Goethe, and Racine and the works of writers such as Joyce, Proust, and Lawrence? I think this is easy to understand. Naturally, modern bourgeois writers are intelligent, sensitive, and have a wider and richer literary tradition than their predecessors. But among their works, there are peculiar and bizarre things that cannot be found in the works of their predecessors. I think it is undeniable that one cannot say why, and even dare not admit that this feature exists. Undoubtedly, a correct explanation of this phenomenon can only be achieved under the illumination of a new methodology. I think these writers are part of the existing culture, and the existing culture is rapidly falling apart. Only this can explain the characteristics of the works of these great modern writers.</p>
<p>Finally, we must also understand whether we should learn from these writers with decadent tendencies? This is a question that has been debated a lot in our publishing industry, and anyone can affirm it without hesitation. But the key is whether we should listen to their commands, or have our own direction? If our writers can deeply understand what kind of writer Joyce is and have his correct worldview, then Joyce will not only not hinder us, but can also give us many benefits; we must study his works and learn from him how to handle the important subject of content and form. We believe that great writers should not only learn from classical works, but also from decadent bourgeois literature. Only the method developed from the most refined historical heritage is the greatest and most correct creative method.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Tragedy by the Sea (8) <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Original by French writer Balzac, translated by Wang Jiansheng</p>
<p>It took the fisherman no more than a minute or two to relate this story, even simpler than my account of my own commission. Ordinary people tell a story without thinking; they only narrate the facts that moved them, shaping them into sentences according to how they felt. Therefore, such narration is as sharp and incisive as a splitting ax.</p>
<p>"I don't want to go to Batuts anymore!" Baoling said as we reached the higher side of the lake. We returned to Nakrolayxick along the salty wetlands. Our fisherman became as silent as we were, leading us through confusing paths. Our souls underwent a great transformation, and we were immersed in melancholy thoughts, caused by seeing Chai Bo and knowing his tragedy. We all knew that our guide was silent because he was thinking about those three people. The misfortune of these three appeared clearly before our eyes, like a performance in a tragedy, and his father's atonement was the climax of this play. We dared not look far at the rock where the unfortunate man sat, a great terror to the villagers. As we witnessed a scene of misery never before seen in our lives, dark clouds covered the sky, and smoke rose from the horizon to the sky. We trudged on the desolate and impure soil and salty wetlands, which could be called a place of ground-born diseases. The ground was divided into many unequal squares, each square surrounded by a gray mud pit and filled with salt water, on which salt had coagulated. Within this artificial depression, there were boundaries, and workers carrying plows moved about on it. They despised the few marsh people, the specific name for salt makers. These people, or rather, these Bredon people, wore special clothes, a white short coat, like a distiller. They only intermarried with their own tribe; in this tribe, there was no example of a woman marrying someone other than a salt maker. The terrible appearance of these marshes, dotted with regular mud squares, and the gray earth, which did not grow any Bredon flowers and plants, harmonized with the bleakness that had once pierced our souls. When we reached the small bay where fresh water flowed in, the barren plants that decorated the beach gave us great joy. As we were passing through, we could see the small island where the Chai Bo Lamei family had once lived standing in the lake; we quickly turned our heads away.</p>
<p>Reaching our inn, we noticed a billiard table placed in a ground-floor room. When we learned that this was the only public billiard table in the Nakrulo Yixi area, we packed our bags overnight, preparing to leave, and the next day, we were already in the city of Julun Di. (The End)</p>

<p>— Zhou Wen</p>
<p>The host slightly furrowed his brows, smiling and squinting at Pale Face’s reddening face; Pale Face also furrowed his brow slightly, returning a smile.</p>
<p>“I think the magazine business is more profitable, at least we should see a bit of interest…”</p>
<p>The host squinted at Pale Face again; but this time Pale Face kept his eyes fixed ahead, sitting at the table next to the dressing mirror, sipping the newly served covered bowl of tea. As he picked up the poetry manuscript the host had passed over, Round Face’s voice drilled into his ears again:</p>
<p>“I definitely have to do this magazine business… and I’ll definitely hire an editor with a reputation…”</p>
<p>The host kept watching Pale Face as he stood there blankly with his mouth half-open, his gaze fixed on the title of the poetry manuscript. He frowned, but immediately his ears were drawn to Round Face's voice:</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter if the salary is a bit high, the deeper you plant, the bigger it grows..."</p>
<p>The host turned his face away; Pale Face followed suit, but immediately their eyes met as the host turned back. He quickly looked away, fixing his gaze back on the poetry manuscript, "Why am I so agitated today?" he thought, his cheeks growing even hotter, wishing the host would just leave. He glanced at the poetry manuscript from the corner of his eye, and sure enough, the host stood up and walked to the square coffee table where the two fat faces were sitting. He gathered his fingers, first lifting the lid of Round Face’s teacup to take a look, then called out:</p>
<p>"Hey, bring some hot water!"</p>
<p>Pale Face was even more powerfully drawn in by this voice, his ears perked up, focusing intently on the side facing the host and Round Face, desperately trying to hear every word of the host’s request to “edit” the magazine; but at the same time, he musically hoped: "Oh, please don't say it, once it's said, it's over!" He strained his ears for a long time, but still couldn't hear the host and Round Face talking, and felt a kind of dissatisfaction, but he endured it; but finally, he couldn't resist anymore, and turned his face to look. He breathed a deep sigh of relief—it turned out the host was gone, and only the two fat faces were talking face to face. He tilted his head to look in the dressing mirror beside him, and dozens of bead-like oily droplets were actually protruding from the tip of his pale nose. He took out a small white handkerchief to wipe his nose, then wrapped a little finger in the handkerchief to clean his nostrils. Looking carefully in the mirror again, the tip of his nose was actually shiny and beautiful, like white wax. He turned his face back and saw Round Face looking at him. He put the poetry manuscript on the table and stood up, clasping his hands behind his back, and slowly walked towards the two fat faces. "I want to tell him before the host comes back," he thought. The magazine... But he suddenly stopped in the middle of the room, because from the corner of his eye he saw the host reappear in the doorway. So he immediately bowed, with a leisurely air lowered his face, and brought his newly polished nose close to a wilting purple-red flower in the clump of dried flowers in the vase, wrinkling his nostrils, and said leisurely:</p>
<p>"Mmm, mmm, so fragrant."</p>
<p>The host stood in front of him, bowing apologetically and frowning:</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm so sorry, I'm so busy, I have to ask people to urge the guests, and write articles...! Oh, I'm really neglecting you, really..."</p>
<p>"It's fine, no problem," Pale Face said, raising his face. "This flower is..."</p>
<p>"Heh heh," Round Face suddenly stood up and interjected. "Look at us two, just talking, leaving our distinguished guest out in the cold. Host, if you have something to do, go do it, we can help you entertain the guests. We're all family, right?" As he spoke, his eyes swept over Pale Face and then looked at Tall Fat Face.</p>
<p>"Right, right. Actually, I should help my relative entertain the guests," Tall Fat Face said, also quickly pulling out the chair from behind him, extending a hand with five fat fingers straight, and suddenly shaking his head and reciting: "The flower-lined path—was never—swept—for guests. The humble gate—is only now—opened—for you." Heh heh! Please?"</p>
<p>The host frowned, carefully holding his breath and glancing at Pale Face from the side.</p>
<p>"Okay, go ahead if you have something to do," Pale Face said with a smile, his ears turning red again. "Don't be so constrained by formality, we're all family, it's okay..."</p>
<h3 id="e187">Passing Through Wuchuan <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Yuan Chenying</p>
<p>When the car stopped in Wuchuan, "a solitary city amidst ten-thousand-foot mountains," it was already four in the afternoon. The sunlight reflecting off the snow on the eastern mountains was dazzling. The car drove into Wuchuan County, and following the dust-flying car were many people dressed in blue cotton clothes, each with a curious look on their faces, quietly discussing where we came from; some even whispered about our overseas Chinese: "Oh! There are even foreign devils!" After saying this, they seemed afraid of us and quietly slipped away. Replacing them was another large group of people, occasionally with one or two more fashionable women, looking at our girls with admiring eyes.</p>
<p>The car abruptly stopped at the county government gate. We went in to make a phone call to Guihua, asking how the two cars that had left with us were doing. The answer was, "The car broke down, it's already back, it will leave again tomorrow!" Getting this answer, we had no choice but to walk out dejectedly. More and more people were crowding around our car, like at a temple fair: looking at us in what they considered colorful clothes, the women still pointing at our girls.</p>
<p>To wait for those two cars, we had to stay here overnight. However, in this small county town, the houses were scattered and dilapidated, there were no large hotels, where could we find lodging for so many people? With great difficulty, we barely found two places: the girls stayed at a girls' elementary school, the boys found another place, and I was fortunate enough to find a friend who was a schoolteacher in this small town, and stayed at his place for one night.</p>
<p>Separating from our companions, I walked to the place of my friend, as young as I was, who had come to this solitary city for a living: it was a boys' elementary school on a slope, the light of a kerosene lamp flickering in the darkness. Entering the room, I was hit by a nauseating odor. I couldn't say what kind of stench it was, I just felt like throwing up. Seeing my expression, my young friend smiled and said, "This is the smell from the coal in the stove. This kind of coal has been buried underground for a short time, and hasn't completely turned into coal. Burning it produces a very foul smell, but it's very cheap, a thousand pounds can be bought for one dollar. Poor families and public institutions all burn this kind of coal!" I asked him, "Wouldn't burning this kind of coal suffocate people?" He laughed and said, "That's okay! If it did, wouldn't I have died long ago? This coal stinks, but it doesn't suffocate people!" Thinking about how my young friend was struggling for a living, leaving his warm home, becoming a "Waiting-for-One-to-Walk-Behind-the-Mountains" (Note 1), and his ability to endure these hardships, compared to the slightly more comfortable life I lived in Guihua City, I was ashamed and speechless.</p>
<p>When drinking water, I felt that the water was not only salty and difficult to drink, but also had a strange odor. But thinking about what had just happened, I didn't say anything. Seeing me frown when drinking water, my friend said, "This water is very salty and hard to drink, right? I'm afraid it's even harder to drink if you add some! This water is well water, it's what ordinary people drink. There's another kind of spring water several miles outside the city, which is as good to drink as the Imperial Spring Well water in Guihua City (Note 2), but only the rich can afford to buy and drink it..." He seemed very emotional as he said this, and I was amazed by his attitude.</p>
<p>After eating dinner at my friend's place, although very tired, I still wanted to go out and take a look, so I followed my friend to the girls' school to see our traveling girls.</p>
<p>The girls were singing hand in hand in the courtyard in twos and threes. Looking in the darkness, listening to the melodious singing, I couldn't help but think that this seemed like another world, it didn't seem like traveling in the desolate borderlands!</p>
<p>At the girls' school, I talked to the middle-aged headmaster for a few words: there are more than four thousand people in this city, but only twenty or thirty girls go to school. People in the city and countryside are still afraid that their daughters will be seduced and eloped with if they go to school. Only a few graduate and go to Guihua for further studies.</p>
<p>When walking back to my friend's place to sleep, the night had fallen deeply, the people who had been watching us had all gone home, leaving only the silent streets, and the barking of dogs was heard from time to time. Listening to my friend tell me the story of how the "Wild Ghosts Scrape" (Note 3) had broken into the city the year before, I thought of a woman I knew who had been ravaged by the Wild Ghosts in that turmoil, imagining so many greenwood heroes carrying guns and riding horses at this time... I couldn't help but feel afraid, crawled into the quilt, and quickly fell asleep.</p>
<p>The next day, I followed my friend to a small restaurant to "go for tea." We passed through the main street and went into a small alley, entering a restaurant like a mountain cave. The stench of coal made me dizzy. The room had no plastered ceiling, and soil would fall into our bowls from time to time. The bed and the ground were full of hardworking people, and some small merchants were killing their morning time here.</p>
<p>After eating a few "Shao Mai" (Note 4), we went out to watch our companions ride horses and watch the soldiers stationed here do push-ups... From morning on, many people gathered around to watch us, until eleven o'clock in the morning, when the two cars from Guihua finally arrived.</p>
<p>Note 1: "Waiting-for-One-to-Walk-Behind-the-Mountains" means those who make a living behind Daqing Mountain and have higher occupations.</p>
<p>Note 2: "Imperial Spring Well" is in front of the Dazhao Temple in Guihua. It is said that Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty once watered his horses here, and it is the sweetest spring water in Suiyuan.</p>
<p>Note 3: "Wild Ghosts Scrape" is what the people of Suiyuan call bandits. Sometimes, the bandits also call themselves "Wild Ghosts Scrape."</p>
<p>Note 4: "Shao Mai" is a special food of the people of Suiyuan, similar to dumplings but with extremely thin skin and smaller than buns. It is the only food for the people of Suiyuan to go to restaurants in the morning.</p>

<h3 id="e188">From Japan's Cultural Undertakings to China's Cultural Construction <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>Japan's cultural undertakings have recently become quite developed. They are not only concerned about the construction of cultural institutions at home, but also pay attention to the external promotion of Japanese culture. It is said that this year, the International Culture Section established by Japan with the International Cultural Undertaking Fund has been very effective since its implementation. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has included more than 1.85 million yuan in next year's budget as the International Cultural Undertaking Fund. The allocation of this fund is used to set up the International Cultural Bureau, Japanese Culture Lectures, Japanese Language Teaching Institutes, and Japanese Research Institutes. Some are used for exchange dispatch fees for domestic and foreign scholars and students, Japanese art introduction fees, international competition fees, international cultural promotion fees, and various international cultural group fees. This shows the importance Japan attaches to cultural undertakings. In particular, they are very enthusiastic about promoting Japanese culture abroad.</p>
<p>The strength of a country can be judged by the level of its culture. The reason why several Western countries are dominating the world today is that their culture is more developed than others. After the Meiji Restoration, Japan also became more prosperous day by day with the progress of its national culture. Although they are currently devoted to strengthening their military preparations, they are still tirelessly creating and carrying out various cultural undertakings. They understand that cultural undertakings are of great importance to the development of the country.</p>
<p>Our country is an ancient civilized country in the world, and our culture once shone brightly in history. But this belongs to the past. Compared with Western civilized countries, China's current culture is at least one or two centuries behind. We say this not to increase the ambition of others and destroy our own prestige. Because the facts are as they are, we cannot hide them. Unless we bring out some spiritual civilization to boast about, we have almost nothing in terms of material culture. One flood kills millions of people, which is a natural disaster, but the lack of material construction can be imagined. As for the spiritual civilization that we often boast about, what is it? Even if it is true, I am afraid it is no longer suitable for the lives of modern Chinese people.</p>
<p>Considering the reasons for the decline of our country's culture today, the main one is that Chinese people have never been willing to accept Western material civilization. People often hold a prejudice that material civilization is base, and only spiritual civilization is worth worshiping. However, the so-called culture should include both material and spiritual, and the two are indispensable. Therefore, in the future, if we want the development of Chinese culture, it is very urgent and necessary to fully import Western material civilization.</p>
<p>Recently, the voice of cultural construction in our country has been singing loudly for a while. Looking at the opinions of all parties, some advocate complete Westernization, some advocate Chinese body and Western use, and some advocate taking China as the base. In our view, no matter which direction China's cultural construction takes in the future, accepting Western material civilization should be the most important task that must be done. If we abandon this and do not do it, Chinese culture will still lag behind others even if we work hard for another five hundred years. As for how to use what method to accept Western material civilization? There is only one method mentioned by Mr. Sun Yat-sen, which is to catch up head-on.</p>
<p>The above is about the cultural construction of our country. If we promote our inherent culture abroad, Chinese culture also has its own characteristics that are worth mentioning to introduce to people, so that foreigners can recognize the true face of China. Although we cannot carry out this work as actively as Japan, we must also pay considerable attention to it. Otherwise, the Chinese people imagined by foreigners may always be an uncivilized nation with braids and small feet.</p>

<p>Taishan City, constructed layer upon layer with the blood and sweat of overseas Chinese, is a gorgeous little market. Here are magnificent buildings, huge department stores, brilliant banks, beautiful schools, and the fragrance of luxurious cosmetics. Everything is the capitalist scene of a newly emerging small city.</p>
<p>Many years ago, when overseas Chinese had not yet developed, this was indeed an old market. Later, as overseas Chinese developed more and more in foreign countries, Guangdong, where overseas Chinese remittances were the most abundant, and especially the people of Taishan, developed the most. Therefore, the people here can truly be said to have traveled all over the world. Indeed, the capital power of the overseas Chinese here can be said to occupy an important position in the major cities of the country. For example, taking the situation in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou, the businessmen of Taishan always occupy the first high chair. Therefore, when we go there, we can always see many, many deeds composed of overseas Chinese capital.</p>
<p>The railway here comes from Jiangmen Gongyi in the north to here, and then from here to Guanghai in the south. The highways extending in all directions are like a net. There is also a very convenient small river that can transport many goods from overseas to this great consumer market. All day long, we can hear the continuous rumble of trains or the noisy sounds of whistles in the small city. The gorgeous cars fly back and forth on the flat and neat cement roads. In fact, the roads in the entire Taicheng are the best in the entire county of Guangdong. The two rows of neat foreign-style houses and shops are no different from the prosperous streets of big cities. When standing under the seven- or eight-story buildings, you may wonder if this is a corner of a metropolis.</p>
<p>Every time it's a market day, it becomes particularly noisy here. The people who come into the city from the four villages are mostly simple women. However, if they are young, they are always dressed in a moving way, wandering the streets with the fragrance of cosmetics. In a quiet corner of the city, there are mostly places for young men and women to enter and exit. In Taicheng, we can see many, many girls dressed like flower branches and handsome men in Western clothes together. All of this has become a special and prosperous phenomenon in Taicheng. The strong atmosphere of luxurious capitalism, at least, is something I cannot deny. Even the tall and beautiful buildings are enough to match the fact that this is a very famous market in the south, and it is a consumer market. However, until recently, after groups of unemployed overseas Chinese returned, overseas Chinese stopped remitting money. As a result, everything here inevitably suffered the impact, and a scene of decline and calm gradually arose. Everything was masked with sadness. And on the streets, "Great Discount" signs are hanging everywhere, fluttering in the wind. No different from big cities, the general feeling of the people is also "indifferent and cold."</p>
<p>When walking slowly from the train station to the streets of Taicheng, we can still see some lively children jumping and walking around. This is a good result of the development of education in Taishan. However, in recent years, due to the unemployment of overseas Chinese and the cessation of remittances, education has also been significantly affected and bankrupt. The number of students in the fourteen or five secondary schools has also been greatly reduced. At the same time, young people who have returned from studying abroad or have graduated from universities in China are scattered in the countryside like sand. As a result, there is a fierce competition for the teaching positions where "there are more monks than porridge," making a mess.</p>
<p>Turning a bend from the southeast corner of the city, the most famous middle school is outside. That gorgeous school building was built with more than 600,000 yuan of overseas Chinese blood and sweat. Therefore, such a school building is quite remarkable. However, I heard that the academic performance inside is very bad, which is also an inevitable phenomenon in Chinese society.</p>
<p>Taking the train from here to the south, you can reach the coast of the South China Sea, and then drift out to the South Pacific Ocean across this sea.</p>

<p>— Ji Tuan</p>
<p>When I was a child, when the smile of childhood had not yet disappeared from my face, I remember how much I loved this supple, snake-like night! Yes, the boundless, silent voice of the night, like a calm sea without wind or waves; the moon's light, like mountain spring water, brought endless, unspoken comfort and remembrance from afar, from the other side of the rivers and mountains; and also! Ah, that forever young (perhaps never aging) light and laughter, the strong flavor of life's enjoyment, the strong flavor of tobacco and wine, these seemed to be marked on the black board of the night with large words and exclamation points: "The night, with its licentiousness, decay, and enjoyment, belongs to young people, forever belongs to young people!"</p>
<p>(Damn it! Does that mean that in these difficult and declining years, young people are only allowed to have this string of numbness and intoxication? Is this "beneficial" for some people? Is it possible that...?)</p>
<p>The night! With its strange quirks and posture, with its cyan and red coat and smile, existed in my shallow childhood days, when life had not yet become a problem of trouble, when the bright smile still remained on the young face...</p>
<p>But year after year, struggling in a not-so-easy life, learning to get by, the dreams and laughter of childhood disappeared, and the mind was occupied by another mysterious problem day and night. The childlike heart was aging day by day, making me forget all the gilded days of false qualities.</p>
<p>(The night is still lingering in my heart, so long, so deep, with no news of awakening! Perhaps she no longer has a charming appearance, but is like life, taking on a gloomy face, with an ever-darkening heart.)</p>
<p>In that way, I forgot about morbid, dim enjoyment; but for the daytime, because it housed many ugly aspects of life that were completely different from ideals, deception, foolishness, and the old troubles of all people; and, what was most unbearable, there was a big, dazzling sun shining there!</p>
<p>The light was so bright that it stung people's vision, making them dare not open their eyes to face it directly, the heat was so scorching that it burned people's skin and could daze their brains. It was the sun that revealed the rusty copper truth of the gilded life at night, which was enough to make people unhappy, enough</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>to make people afraid and disgusted.</p>
<p>But finally, on an unexpected day, I saw the value of the sun in another kind of light.</p>
<p>One morning—an early morning. The surroundings were still quiet, and the hustle and bustle of the world could not be heard; in the trees, birds were sparsely chirping, the remnant stars were still twinkling, and I, as if I had finished a long journey, suddenly woke up from my dream in a hurry.</p>
<p>Braving the morning air, I quietly walked to the suburbs; it was the weather of early autumn, dew glistening on the grass, the wind was gentle, and dissolved the breath of soil and plants.</p>
<p>The sun—this sun! It had silently hung up. Looking at it, it was easy to think of Turgenev's poem "Morning"; it spread its light wide on the ground, still so dazzling, so hot.</p>
<p>Gradually, getting used to it, I began to find it kind: looking at its face: serious, enthusiastic, truly golden; basking in it, like immersing myself in the hot spring water of Egypt, warm and firm, where darkness and indifference did not exist!</p>
<p>So, I began to learn to use it, letting it drape over my whole body, unafraid, and without rushing, I tried a sunbath, the doctor had advised me: "In treatment, sunlight is a priceless medicine."</p>
<p>So I thought: In the daily life of getting closer to the sunlight, my body may become a little better, my skin may no longer be so pale and loose, and all the health deficiencies may gradually disappear, right?</p>
<p>A feeling of spiritual comfort made me unable to speak my gratitude, I only felt: being able to have the sun permanently is the greatest happiness in the world.</p>
<p>From this moment on, I began to feel the value of the sun, and recognized the gloom and pretense of the night.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Mr. Shen <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Ying</p>
<p>Long years and a difficult life have refined Mr. Shen's character to be like that of a child. In his sixties, he spends every day with children around the age of ten. Tears, snot, rulers, dog-eared books, and the clamor of recitations. Mr. Shen looks at this group of twenty or thirty kowtowing children, like a cluster of buzzing golden flies on rotten meat, while he himself observes serenely, with a satisfied smile.</p>
<p>A child recites Tang poetry in a drawn-out tone: "Left home young, return old, / Accent unchanged, but hair grown gray. / Children see me, do not know me, / Smiling, they ask, 'Where do you come from, guest?'" Mr. Shen loves this poem the most. He listens to it with longing, lightly tapping the table as if keeping time. Whenever he hears this poem, he cannot help but quietly recall his childhood in his old and lonely heart—the autumn sun in the courtyard, painting the slender, pale shadows of sunflowers, gently trembling on the white wall, and soft white clouds leisurely drifting across a corner of the blue sky. It is as if it were still late spring. … His youth was spent entirely in books and examination baskets. The title of a "Xiucai" (successful candidate in the imperial examination) was the price he paid for ten years of studying by the cold window. He was born into a family of scholars for generations. In this small town, there were few who studied. His father was a "Juren" (successful provincial candidate) and a gentry director, and the income from the fields was enough to keep the family well-fed. In those days, Mr. Shen lived in a carefree era. Although he studied nothing but eight-legged essays and test poems, he was also intoxicated by the situation where "beauty like jade is found in books." On a fine afternoon in spring or autumn, he would take a volume of poetry to the Wanghai Teahouse along the river, brew a pot of tea, and savor the sentences in the book while admiring the sails on the river. He didn't have to do anything. Mr. Shen's future was his father's present. Passing the Juren exam meant becoming a local gentry director, with no worries about food and clothing. Why bother with diligent livelihood? In his eyes, the dream was perfect. But the tide of the times swept away his last hope. The death of his father added to his sorrow, but what saddened him most was that he had to open his eyes and see how the burden of life was added to his weak shoulders. At that time, he was over thirty years old and the father of three children.</p>
<p>Recommended by relatives, he became an accountant in a shop. Abacuses, silver coins, and ledgers—things he usually didn't pay attention to—now became his close companions. Middle-aged emotions, coupled with a cumbersome family, meant that life would no longer rise to any waves. However, the store life, which had never been experienced before, made his temperament dull, and like a lame ox pulling a heavy plow, he hobbled through twenty years. —Twenty years, again this long period of time! People grew old, and the children in the family grew up. His own mouth was covered with a graying beard, but it could not cover his melancholy smile. But before his melancholy smile had faded from the corners of his mouth, the shop where he worked as an accountant closed its doors, and he lost his job. Naturally, for three whole years, he could not find another place. —In his old heart, he thought that he could enjoy his old age at home, but his grown-up sons did not earn enough to be independent. He had no choice but to relive his old dream, opening a private school, recruiting twenty or thirty thin children. On the one hand, he could get some pocket money, and on the other hand, he could pass the boring years. While the children were chanting in long tones, he habitually took out a paper cigarette, watched the curling white smoke, and reminisced about the traceless past. He didn't know if it was regret or remembrance. …</p>
<p>After letting the children of the private school go, Mr. Shen also dragged his aging steps to go outside for a walk. But he was no longer in the mood to go to the Wanghai Teahouse. This old shop, which had been through thirty or forty years of weathering, was still as it always had been.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Seaside <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Cun Yin</p>
<p>(Blue sea, red sea, laughing sea, roaring sea.)</p>
<p>In the morning? Strolling along the coast, a kind of vast, solid feeling, like rice, fills my stomach; it simply fills me up, and that boundless freshness is endlessly, endlessly there.</p>
<p>The morning sun is as beautiful as a young girl. If my hand could touch its tenderness, then I would say, "It is as gentle as velvet!" And the rolling sea is even more beautiful than the sun, than velvet. Sometimes it dances, and sometimes it hums a Picnic-style tune that is both sorrowful and light.</p>
<p>(I like listening to the occasional roar that flies by and stimulates my nerves.)</p>
<p>But at noon, the sun's face is stretched taut like iron.</p>
<p>(I do not hear any delicate music of nature, I do not see any moving dances of nature. I am frightened, I only know that the sea is fast asleep.)</p>
<p>The gentle sea sleeping under this violent sun is as pitiful as a cow about to be slaughtered. But who can ask this violent sun to become more gentle?</p>
<p>That seaside, how pitiful! It seems to be telling me:</p>
<p>"These days are really hard to bear!"</p>
<p>For the suffering of the sea, I also suffer. I have to close my eyes and quietly try to fall asleep quickly. Listening to the hot sea breeze lazily crawling, crawling over my body, it seems that a million weights of pain all belong to me.</p>
<p>(Blue sea, red sea, laughing sea, roaring sea.)</p>
<p>In the evening, the fishermen row back from afar. They drink the blood of the sea and catch the cells of the sea.</p>
<p>(Watching the seaside at dawn and dusk is that towering pale peak. Counting one, two, three, four... walking from here to there, it should make you forget the number of your steps. But standing on the seaside and looking back, in a few seconds, you can immediately see that pale peak. It is passionately comforting the seaside, it is like a young boy who has just come of age, flirting with this beautiful girl. And when the emotions between them become so intense that they cannot be more intense, the peak will emit smoke, and the peak will give its own small soul to this tender girl—and then, the people who live there will suffer panic. When they are in turmoil, the soul of the peak and the seaside kiss each other sweetly. They embrace.</p>
<p>The moon comes out. The seaside's tenderness instantly forgets the pain of noon.</p>
<p>Men and women, as lively as a cherry blossom festival, some dragging canvas chairs, setting up small round tables, with their beer.</p>
<p>However, the fishermen over there, carrying bright lights and chewing on the leftovers from their evening meal, are about to step onto their fishy fishing boats to work again.</p>
<p>Those who swim in the sea and drink beer on the seaside do not pay attention to the hard work of these tiny fishermen; they are indifferent to suffering that is not their own!</p>
<p>Yes, the seaside is extremely beautiful, harmonized by the moonlight. But the girl-like sea wakes up, and it roars. ——</p>

<p>Beginning with "Jiang Gan Steals the Book in the Three Kingdoms," Part 1</p>
<p>Emperor Xian of Han sits in Xuchang. The ruler is weak and the ministers are strong, and the court is in disarray. That Cao Cao usurped power and crowned himself Prime Minister of Han. Liu Xuande was defeated in Dangyang. He sought refuge in Jiangxia to plot his resurgence. That Sun Quan inherited the family business and carved out a territory on the Yangtze River. Zhuge Liang followed Lu Su across the river. He shared his wisdom with Zhou Lang. Sun and Cao immediately drew their swords. Zhou Gongjin quickly boarded a leaf of a boat and charged into Cao's camp. But he saw that the northern army's naval camps were each strong in their own way. He was so frightened that his eyes were fixed, his mouth was agape, and he was silent. He hurriedly asked for details. Who is the admiral of the navy? He was told that Cai Mao and Zhang Yun were in charge. These two have been stationed in Xingzhou for a long time and are familiar with naval warfare. Their tactics are sophisticated and their strategies are strong. Zhou Yu thought, if I don't eliminate Cai and Zhang, how can I avenge myself and return home? At that time, Meng De ascended to the main tent. Civil and military officials stood on both sides. Cao Cao asked, "Have we fought today?" He reported, "Our army was defeated and the generals were wounded. Today Zhou Lang explored our naval camp and was laughed at by the enemy." Cao Cao should have suffered losses and lost generals. Jiang Gan, who seemed to be a cultured gentleman, walked out. In fact, he was full of literary excrement. He wore a brown turban with seven folds, inlaid with a piece of jade in the middle. He had shifty rat eyes and triangular eyes. His eyebrows secretly hid treachery. Before he opened his mouth to speak, he bared his teeth. His bad breath was truly unbearable. His strange face was green and thin. He had a mustache in the shape of the character "eight" which was thin and yellow. He responded and stepped forward to honor the Prime Minister. He recommended himself to cross the river, saying he was extremely willing. With his glib tongue, he would persuade Zhou Yu to surrender to the Prime Minister. Because, he said, "I and Zhou Lang are classmates." (To be continued)</p>

<p>— (Tomorrow)</p>
<p>(1) Everyone knows that Ye Qianyu is a nationally renowned cartoonist, but they don't know that he has long been in the film industry. He drew Mr. Wang on paper, and now he has put him on the screen. We think that the creator of the hilarious Mr. Wang, who makes people want to laugh at first sight, must be a humorous person with Mr. Wang's demeanor. If you think that way, then you are completely wrong. His appearance is short and agile, his personality is sincere and harmonious, and he has the full demeanor of an artist. But he is now the manager of the New Era Company. You must think that artists cannot handle affairs, right? In fact, this is another mistake. He can not only handle all affairs, but he handles them very well. You see the New Era Company developing day by day, which is the result of his work.</p>
<p>(2) The name Tang Jie should not be unfamiliar, but he is now surnamed Wang instead of Tang. Only Ye Qianyu probably knows why he is surnamed Wang. If readers want to ask me what Tang Jie looks like, then I would like to ask you to look at Ye Qianyu's Mr. Wang cartoon. If it is still not clear enough, then you should go and see Mr. Wang on the screen. You can clearly see Tang Jie's true face on the screen, and you can also discover the reason why he is surnamed Wang. He has changed a bit since he came back from Suzhou. Miss Hu Die was the first to see him and asked in surprise, "Mr. Wang, why are you so dark and thin?" Tang Jie couldn't help but sigh and said, "I recently went to the countryside, and the countryside is bankrupt. The farmers are trapped in deep water and fire. My being so dark and thin is just one ten-thousandth of the people's suffering that I brought back from the countryside. The whole picture of the bankrupt, pitiful, and ridiculous countryside, you can see it again when I finish filming the interior scenes." After hearing this, Miss Hu couldn't help but feel sad for a long time.</p>
<p>(3) We only know Cao Xuesong as a writer, but we don't know when he actually became a clown. According to him, he has his philosophy of being a clown. Naturally, in this day and age, it is rare and valuable to laugh yourself and make others laugh as well. His nickname is Little Chen, but Little Chen is not small. If you have seen the Mr. Wang movie, you will know what he looks like. He returned from Suzhou this time without filming. He said to people, "Although I didn't act in front of the camera when I went to Suzhou, I did a very wonderful job in the play of life." After speaking, he gave a smug smile. There are many mysteries hidden in this smile.</p>
<p>(4) The name Jiang Ming was very familiar to people four or five years ago, but since then there has been a long period of separation. It is said that he unfortunately had lung disease and slept in the hospital for three years. Now he has recovered his health, and we very much hope to see his elegance on the stage again, but he has also changed his career recently. He is a screenwriter in the New Era Company. The Mr. Wang film has been widely welcomed. Although no audience will pay attention to this unnamed hero behind the scenes, he is particularly interested in this behind-the-scenes work. He said that he was a loyal audience of the drama of life on this trip to Suzhou. Therefore, Cao Xuesong's mystery did not dare to be displayed in front of him. He could see everything clearly, the moonlight of the Caiyun Bridge, the carriages in the tree-lined avenue... According to him, he will write a story about "Suzhou's Carriages." I don't know what is carried on these carriages. Let's wait and see. (To be continued)</p>

<p>This time, the floods in our country have spread across several provinces, and the number of disaster victims has reached more than ten million. The country's vitality has been greatly damaged. In order to provide relief, Lianhua Company has launched a disaster relief movie to do its best. It has united with movie theaters across the country to hold it unanimously. Lianhua has specially selected its most colorful products from the past to show in rotation. Half of the income will be allocated to the theaters, and the other half that Lianhua should receive will be entirely handed over to the Disaster Relief Committee for disaster relief. The opening theaters are all over the country, and it is expected that the income will be considerable. It is hoped that people across the country will actively support it and do their best to help the country recover its vitality. It will not only benefit the disaster victims.</p>

<p>Tan Youliu's new film, tentatively titled "Song of Tomorrow," is being written diligently.</p>

<p>Mid-Priced Cars Suddenly Show Activity</p>
<p>If we observe the history of the American automotive industry, the production and sales figures undoubtedly reached their peak in 1929. Starting in 1930, a wave of recession began to stir, and the entire United States was filled with a bleak atmosphere. Nineteen out of every ten industrial and commercial sectors were affected, and the automotive industry was naturally no exception, suffering considerable impact.</p>
<p>Therefore, after the onset of the recession, the number of cars produced by various American automakers suddenly declined. Recalling the heyday of the automotive industry in 1929, American automakers produced a total of 5,622,000 vehicles that year. Subsequently, this number decreased to 3,510,000 vehicles in 1930, 2,472,000 vehicles in 1931, 1,431,000 vehicles in 1932, 1,986,000 vehicles in 1933, and 2,896,000 vehicles in 1934. From the figures, we can see that the production of American cars decreased year by year starting from 1930, with the lowest production in 1932, only a quarter of that in 1929. Production increased again from 1933, but it was still far from the levels of 1929.</p>
<p>Because the production in 1933 increased compared to 1932, and 1934 was even higher than 1933, the leaders of the American automotive industry became optimistic, believing that the era of recovery for the American automotive industry had arrived. Therefore, at the end of 1934, all car manufacturers increased production in their 1935 business plans, believing that the total American car production in 1935 would be at least four million. Since the beginning of 1935, the sales of new cars have indeed shown sudden activity, with production and sales figures exceeding one million vehicles in the first quarter. Although the exact statistics for the first half of the year have not been officially released, it can be asserted that they are above two million vehicles. Therefore, the goal of producing four million cars for the entire year is likely achievable, and it is no wonder that American automakers are excited.</p>
<p>If we classify the cars produced by American manufacturers based on their selling prices, we can divide them into three categories: high-priced, mid-priced, and low-priced. In the past, low-priced cars had the highest sales, followed by mid-priced cars, and high-priced cars had the lowest sales. This was naturally an immutable rule. However, after 1929, even in terms of percentages, the sales of low-priced cars increased year by year, while the sales of mid-priced and high-priced cars decreased year by year. The only reason for this was that, under the raging tide of the recession, the economic strength of the average American citizen was weakened, and they were unable to purchase mid-priced or higher cars. At the same time, advancements in automobile manufacturing engineering made low-priced cars as stable, fast, and safe as high-priced cars. So, if one were to buy a high-priced car, why not buy a low-priced car that offers more value for money? Based on the two reasons mentioned above, the sales of low-priced cars almost completely captured the market share of mid-priced and high-priced cars.</p>
<p>However, things took an unexpected turn. Since the beginning of this year, the sales of mid-priced cars have suddenly increased in terms of percentages. As a result, people in the automotive industry have become even more confident in the recovery of the car industry due to the activity of mid-priced cars. All automotive industry leaders have said that, under these circumstances, a general recovery of the automotive industry is possible. Recalling the increases in automobile production by American manufacturers in 1933 and 1934, these were all due to improved sales of low-priced cars. In terms of percentages, low-priced cars increased year by year, while mid-priced and higher cars decreased year by year. Therefore, in those years, all car manufacturers still focused their attention on low-priced cars. However, the results showed that, in terms of percentages, the sales of mid-priced cars priced from $650 to $850 increased the most.</p>
<p>In the first four months of this year, the total number of General Motors' Pontiac and Oldsmobile, and Chrysler's Dodge registered throughout the United States reached 148,315 vehicles, an increase of 110.7% compared to the same period last year, while passenger car sales only increased by 60.8%. In May and June, the sales of mid-priced cars continued to increase, just as they did in the first four months. According to a report from Chrysler on June 15, Dodge sales in the last week totaled 4,265 vehicles, an increase of 5.4% compared to the previous week. In the 24 weeks of this year, up to June 15, a total of 90,406 vehicles were sold, an increase of 97.4% compared to the same period last year.</p>
<p>In the first four months, the total number of low-priced cars registered in the United States was 652,353 vehicles, accounting for 73.4% of the total car sales. In terms of quantity, this was an increase of 57% compared to the same period last year, but in the first four months of last year, the percentage of low-priced cars was 75.2%. Therefore, people in the automotive industry have said that the surge in sales of mid-priced cars has proven that society has more money to buy cars. People who were qualified to buy high-priced cars but bought low-priced cars after the start of the recession are now returning to their original state and want to buy more expensive cars.</p>

<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Statistics on Vehicle Accidents in the UK: In the first six months of 1935, there were a total of 15,000 road vehicle accidents in Great Britain. According to an analysis by the Department of Transport, pedestrians on the road were the most affected, while drivers were the least affected. If we calculate using percentages, pedestrians account for 55.9%, cyclists 20.2%, motorcyclists 12.9%, passengers 6.2%, and drivers 4.8%. Further statistical analysis shows that 85.1% of pedestrians died due to their own carelessness, of which 30.2% were children under the age of fifteen. From these two points of view, it is a fair opinion that the majority of drivers and passengers are very careful while driving. Young children are the most careless about the traffic on the road, and their knowledge of traffic is the most superficial. Therefore, parents and school authorities should pay attention to this matter. On the other hand, driver error accounts for a large percentage of accidents, estimated at 25.1%, with excessive speed being the biggest primary cause of accidents. What is most peculiar is that the time when accidents occur most frequently each day is between 5 pm and 7 pm. It is speculated that the reason for this is that adults are eager to go home from work to rest at this time, so the speed of vehicles increases, and accidents are likely to occur as a result. As for the morning, everyone seems lazy and unwilling to go to the office, so the speed of vehicles is moderate and safer.</p>
<p>Abolition of the US Federal Gasoline Tax: The taxation of gasoline in the United States almost goes through two levels. In addition to state taxes, there are also federal taxes. Because the burden on drivers is too heavy, they have recently requested the abolition of the federal tax. There are 300 organizations participating in this tax abolition movement, representing 21 states. According to statistics, if this tax is removed, it would save taxpayers at least $170,000,000 per year. This is in addition to the $500,000,000 in state taxes and the $350,000,000 in registration fees. For New York State alone, it would cost an additional $13,800,000 per year.</p>
<p>One in One Hundred People Will Be Injured: Because the automotive industry in the United States is very developed, the annual car accident rate is also the highest. According to statistics published in the recent issue of "Public Safety" magazine, one in every hundred people in the United States was injured in a car accident last year. This statistic is based on the number of accidents last year. Last year, a total of 1,250,000 people were injured in car accidents in the United States, and the population of the United States is approximately 125,000,000 people, which is a ratio of one to one hundred. "Public Safety" magazine also based this ratio to tell the public that, "According to the above calculations, if there are two people alive now, one of them is bound to be injured in the next fifty years. One in four people has the possibility of being injured in twenty-five years. One in five people is in danger of being injured in the next twenty years. If a person has twenty close relatives and friends, unless everyone is very careful on the road, one of these twenty people is destined to be injured or even lose their lives in a car accident in the next five years.</p>
<h3 id="e205">The Japanese Automotive Industry <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Xiaocun</p>
<p>In 1934, the total value of imported foreign finished automobiles, chassis, tires, etc. to Japan was 41,193,324 Japanese yen. Compared to the import of 22,275,937 Japanese yen in 1930, it has more than doubled.</p>
<p>The annual increase in this import amount has been the case since 1925. After the increase in tariff barriers in 1932, although the quantity of industry imports has been greatly affected, due to the drop in the exchange rate, Japan's automobile imports have not decreased in terms of value.</p>
<p>Due to the progress of the arms industry, the automotive industry in 1934 experienced a surprising increase in both quantity and value. The following table shows its general outline.</p>
<p>Imports of Finished Automobiles</p>
<p>1934 1933</p>
<p>Quantity 896 vehicles 491 vehicles</p>
<p>Value 3,357, 1,864,</p>
<p>061 yen 392 yen</p>
<p>Imports of Automobile Chassis</p>
<p>1934 1933</p>
<p>Quantity 950 frames 780 frames</p>
<p>Value 1,167, 1,115</p>
<p>027 yen 531 yen</p>
<p>Imports of Automobile Parts</p>
<p>1934 1933</p>
<p>Value 27,769 10,883</p>
<p>,236 yen ,014 yen</p>
<p>Total Value Above 41,1 22,175</p>
<p>93,324 yen ,937 yen</p>
<p>Although imports of foreign-made automobiles have surged, domestic automobile manufacturing has also been very active, showing remarkable progress. Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. is considered the leader in the industry. In 1931, the company only manufactured 434 automobiles in one year. After that, it made annual progress. In 1932, it produced 840 vehicles. In 1933, it produced 1,790 vehicles. By last year, 1934, it had increased to 2,500 vehicles. It is expected that the statistics by the end of the year will be more than double this number. In October last year, the export procedures for a large batch of small "Datsun" passenger cars imported from Japan to Australia were managed entirely by Mitsubishi Corporation.</p>
<p>It is said that Nissan Industrial Co., Ltd., which manufactures the aforementioned "Datsun" automobiles, has become one of Japan's well-known large industries and has decided to increase its capital to 200,000,000 Japanese yen, with 99,415,000 yen actually paid up.</p>
<p>Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. has also joined forces with other industry players such as Japan Automobile Co., Ltd. to form a company to raise a large amount of capital specifically for industry lending, pawn lending, and production projects.</p>
<p>The above picture shows the Shunfeng brand all-steel automobile encountering its first accident on the Shanghai-Nanjing Highway. The car was provided by a certain gentleman and was driven by a chauffeur. At that time, due to excessive speed, he lost control, causing the car to suddenly drive to the side of the road. After rolling twice, it plunged from one side of a ditch that was seven feet deep and twenty feet wide, directly to the field on the opposite side of the ditch before stopping. At that time, the front of the car was facing the road, and the body of the car did not overturn. The people in the car, including a young woman holding a child, were all shaken up, but none of them were injured. Even the glass on the car was not shattered. Afterwards, everyone felt deeply fortunate and believed that their survival was due to the Shunfeng brand all-steel automobile.</p>
