<h3 id="c47">論蘇俄改革憲法恒 <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>據作日歐電謂蘇俄之蘇維埃大會已通過政府所提出之憲法修改案此案之要點有三㈠爲由記名投票改爲不記名投票㈡爲由間接選舉改爲直接選舉㈢爲農工選舉權利均等此種改革不能不謂爲蘇俄憲政史上重要之一頁蓋蘇俄者一世界著聞之獨裁國家也而能毅然爲若是之改革且此種改革事前絕無徵象而又出於統治者自身之發動此一般人所引爲驚異者故其動機原委之所在尤足令人注意</p>
<p>第一·記名投票之弊世之政治學者言之詳矣其最要者卽選民意志以有所顧忌難爲自由之表示故記名投票質直言之實非良善制度蘇俄此一改革實可謂爲適合於現世第二·間接選舉向爲寳塔式之蘇維埃制度之特色亦爲蘇俄當局操縱選舉拘束選民意志之要訣今能改爲直接選舉則此後中央執委與選民之關係自必更行接近第三·蘇俄向日之選舉制度每重工而輕農故農人在蘇維埃大會中之代表權數量上遠弱於工人今次之改革實欲躋農工於平等之地位不可謂非一大進步故就此問題之表面論蘇俄政治之趨向於民主化固屬顯然。</p>
<p>惟我人今日所應研究者卽蘇俄此種政治上之改革能否影響其獨裁之政權就事實方面觀蘇俄今日資產階級已不復存在異黨組織亦皆消滅卽其本黨中之托洛資基派與布哈林派亦已先後失敗農人以集體農塲之故亦皆工業化與工人地位毫無二致故自大體言之今日之蘇俄事實上已成所謂無產階級獨佔優勢之情狀於此而謀政治上之改革則享其利者自爲「無產階級」而非其他階級故蘇俄今次對於憲法之改革雖爲民主化之徵象然按之實際亦純爲「無產階級」以内之民主化不能與英美式之民主政治相提並論明乎此卽知蘇俄今次憲法之改革不獨不足以動搖其所謂「無產階級」之獨裁抑且足以鞏固其地位焉</p>
<p>據塔斯社消息謂蘇俄此次憲法之改革發動於史丹林史式何以有此大膽之行動實爲極有意味之問題就我人觀察史氏之動機似在博取國内之同情以絕托派勢力之再起蓋史氏者一善用政治戰略之政治家也彼之所以有今日之地位卽在善用他人之主張吾人一觀史氏勢力膨脹之經過卽可恍然方列寗逝世之後蘇俄共黨裂爲二派㈠爲左翼之托派㈡爲右翼之布哈林派前者主張中止新經濟政策以謀共產社社會之急速實現者則主維持現狀此時托派聲勢喧赫故史氏聯右派以倒托迨托倒而後史氏卽利用托氏平素之主張猛力推行其五年計劃及右派自覺受紿謀倒史氏史又以倒托之法還倒右派於是五年計畫遂成史氏一人獨特之政績而史氏之威望亦由之增加最近史氏右臂基洛夫被刺蘇俄官塲指爲托派陰謀事實上是否如此雖不可知惟與托派殘餘勢力之一方面想亦不無關係總之蘇俄黨派間之變化吾人固不易明瞭但就事實以觀卽如政治之民主化亦爲托氏宿昔所主張則今次史氏之改革憲法用意卽不難推測且可决定蘇俄此一行動不獨與無產階級之獨裁不生妨碍卽於史丹林個人之權威亦將有增而無减耳。</p>

<p>城市工業衰微　農村景象略佳美國因ＮＲＡ實行、效果細微、不得不轉變過來用「新政策、」去年夏天一般經濟界情形、很顯然的改善了、但是到了冬季、因爲季節關係、又向下頽落、一九三四年十一月間、製造工業界和鑛山界的勞工、比十月間少雇了八萬六千人、換言之、卽失業者數目增加、同時上述產業所支付的工資、也减少了三百九十一萬五千元美金、這就是工人方面的收入减少、假如將季節關係除去不算、那末衰微的現象、還不算嚴重、卽十一月份、工人就業、祇比十月减少百分之一·九、而工資却减少百分之二·五、由此證明美國經濟、是尙在勉强掙扎、眞正的恢復、還覺相當的遙遠、</p>
<p>所以一九三四年十一月底、聯邦緊急救濟局局長何布根斯、曾向羅斯福總統進言、主張「根本滅絕美國的窮困、」丨ＥＰＩＡ（ＥndＰovertyinＡmerica）其提議的綱要、約有以下的幾件、</p>
<p>㈠社會保險計劃、</p>
<p>㈡擴張補助農家匡救農村的計劃、</p>
<p>㈢將生計困難的土地居住者、大量移轉到文化的住宅地區去、</p>
<p>㈣以國庫資本放欵給農民、作購買農具與購買家畜的費用、</p>
<p>㈤擴張失業工人進工廠作工的計劃</p>
<p>㈥計劃將不能作農業移民的人、都分給大規模的低廉住宅、</p>
<p>以上各項、除了分給低廉住宅而外、其餘各項、雖然是小規模的、但已見諸實施、其於美國實際經濟現象的帮助並不大、所以「何布根斯」以爲如果要節約救濟費、可以由聯邦經營的工廠、出而收容失業者、要他們各自照自身的需要、實行生產、將生產品作物與物的交換、但不給工資、這或許可以節約若干的救濟費、亦未可知、</p>
<p>自施行ＮＲＡ政策以來、至於現在、羅斯福政府確盡了最大的努力、雖不一定有效、却能維持著現狀、如上述ＥＰＩＡ計劃、所需要的費用總額、恐怕要九十萬萬美金、假定其執行期間爲二年、則每年須開支四十五萬萬美金、究竟施行了以後、能否得到圓滿的結果、還是疑問、不過今日的美國、須大規模作救貧運動、是毫無疑義的、因此而實施通貨膨脹政策、也是必不得已、若不如此、則將來及當前的危險、恐怕會更見擴大、</p>
<p>所幸的、是在冬季開始時、也有此部分略見增加、例如農具工業的工人、十一月份較上月增加了百分之九·一、百貨商店與</p>
<p>通信販賣的工人了、也增加了百分之六·四、煤炭工業、因爲冬季需要加多的原故、炭坑工人增加百分之三·八、這誠然有多少季節關係、却也含得有若干經濟好轉的成分、</p>
<p>經濟恐慌、在農村中特别嚴重、尤其是一九三二年秋季以後、農業生產品、比大戰以前竟低落了百分之三十五、而他們所必需的工業製造品價格、却上漲了百分之七、所以農民的購買力、祇有大戰前的百分之六十一、由此反映到都市、自然要加深恐慌的程度、但是去年秋季以後、農村情形、漸次轉佳、農民所得、由一九三三年的五十四萬八千萬美金、增加到六十五萬萬美金（其中在包含得有六萬一千萬美金的農業救濟費、）但比較上年、還是增加了百分之二二、而農村購買力（在十一月底、）却已上昇到大戰前的百分之八二、所以農具工業等纔向上增進、可惜這仍舊是局部的現象、一千一百萬失業者、還是沒有多大變動、（一月十二日）</p>

<p>銀行營業尙　錢業平平</p>
<p>米業不振各業終難復與</p>
<p>蕪湖通信、蕪湖爲皖省唯一商埠、交通便利、商業繁盛、市　擳比、商覃輻輳、惟向來滴業之盛衰、皆以米市爲轉移、近年因受洋米傾銷影響、致米市一獗不振、凡百商業、　不大受打擊、上年皖南北早災慘重、皖南各縣又遭匪患、市面不景氣更形尖銳化、兼以銀根奇緊、金融界又無大宗欵項放出、各業乃無不處於恐慌之中、在此艱難困苦時期、不特創業匪易、資本稍不充裕者、即有不能支持之勢、裁汰店員、力求緊縮、故每年總結束之後、失業店員不知凡幾、生活愈感困難、社會經濟亦愈形衰落、記者根據商務習慣、於舊年結算盤貨後、分向各業實地調查、大都虧多盈少、其能敷衍開支者、已屬幸事、在一般商人之心目中、去年之惡劣環境、已隨廢年在除夕以俱逝、惟有希望今年米市活動、廣潮各帮放手營業收販、庶幾蕪湖商業或有轉機之可能、茲將上年重要商業槪况、略誌於次、</p>
<p>銀行　蕪市銀行業、近年以來、營業頗稱發達蕪歲安徽銀行倒閉後、增設四省農民銀行、仍共爲六家、業務無不蒸蒸日上、中國交通上海三行、皆注重於糧食押欵交易、對於信用放欵、可謂絕無、大結束後、並無倒賬之虧、各行皆有盈餘、據最近調查、銀行界所做押欸、約有五百萬元以上、收入存欵、總數有一千萬元左右、春假各行休業四日、另補星期一日、定於九日照常營業、</p>
<p>錢莊　錢業在昔爲金融界之樞紐、當米市活動時期、共有錢莊三十四家、業務之盛、極於一時、各莊每年均有數萬金之盈餘、近年農村破產、市面衰落、該業向以信用放欵爲唯一業務、遂無不吃鉅大之倒賬、囚不支而收歇者、絡繹不絕、去春上市僅有興大·承餘·興康·源康·恒茂·等七家、然皆縮小範圍、並無大宗欵項放出、亦少賬累、年終結束、雖略有盈餘、但不過紙上富貴而已、聞本年又將有兩家收歇、錢業受時代之淘汰、從此商塲中恐不復有其地位矣、</p>
<p>米業　蕪埠米業、分採運·米行·礱坊·碾米·數帮、年來因洋米在華南一帶傾銷、廣潮各帮、被逼停辦、致米市一落千丈、舊歲若非烟寗滬漢各帮及軍米源源採辦、幾無米市可言、全年米糧出口、在昔盛時、達八百萬石、去年則不過一百三四十萬石而已、年終結束、廣潮帮米號與江廣米行、因經年未做交易、虧蝕甚鉅、惟碾米廠及礱坊各家均收進囤積、其時成本每担六元數角後因來源稀少、市價步漲、每担須售洋十元、凡有未脫出者、莫不大獲厚利、</p>
<p>紗業　蕪湖較大工業、尙在萌芽時代、紗廠僅有裕中一家、係李伯行等所創辦、開工十餘年、從未獲利、中間數度改組、營業依然不振、總計歷年虧蝕有百餘萬元之鉅、至於經售棉紗之紗號、共有十餘家、生意尙稱平穩、資本亦甚雄厚、其中尤以實裕同春等營業爲最大、舊歲總結束、各紗號皆有盈無絀、</p>
<p>布業　蕪市綢緞布業、近年因綢貨價格慘落、暗受虧耗、爲數不貲、加受時局影響、銀根緊迫、竟無一家不縮小範圍、營業亦逐漸减色、舊年春夏兩季、生意平平、迨入秋後、同業互相競爭、特别放盤、並加贈品、如共興大成仁記慶大長恊和鴻章、交易稍形發達、惟開支浩繁、結束後多苦樂不匀、共興慶大長大成等、因資本較厚、尙各有數千金之盈餘、</p>
<p>南貨　南貨業在同業公會註册者、大小共有百餘家、業務尙稱不惡、蓋所售貨物、皆爲人生日食必需之品也、昔年以閩帮福昇泰、微帮汪裕隆爲個中翹楚、每年營業數額、約有三十萬元左右、近年因時局市面關係、人民購買力薄弱、交易頗爲减色、汪裕隆已收歇、福昇泰全年營業收入亦不滿十萬元、一家如此、他家可知、舊歲自春徂冬、貨價平隱、大都無利可圖、惟冬季十一月間、油價暴漲未已、凡有大宗存貨者、均獲厚利、</p>
<p>此外如五金·木行·質·藥·百貨·肥皂·染坊·銀·</p>
<p>樓·紙張·等業、生意均較往年遜色、简直無盈餘可言、聞本年收歇商店甚多、此種沒落狀態、實爲數十年所未有也、（八日）</p>

<p>股票價値，除維持金本位的國家外，都見高漲。金利的低下，尤證明資本的過剩，這出就是慢性的經濟恐慌，依然繼續存在的證據。</p>
<p>再者，恐慌的基礎是建築在生產過剩上面，我們不敢說一九三四年的世界經濟已脫離恐慌之境的原因，就是因爲生產過剩仍然繼續存在着。各種商品的「限制生產」和「减產恊定」，即是明證。然而「限制生產」，旣非合理的經濟法則，抑且有理亂麻越弄越亂的顾險。加以各國批預算，赤字很大，更非有迫切的克服經濟危機的方法不可，所以奪取推廣過剩商品的新市塲，使成爲列强唯一的手段了。因此若干國家，利用機會，刦奪别國的領土，以爲殖民地；如日本强奪我東西省即爲一例。若干國家因地理的關係，爲要擴充市塲，則不得不運用其經濟力以征服世界，如美國的放棄金本位，實行通貨膨脹，匯兌貶價等。當然採取政治和軍事的力量，以擴充其市塲的，同時也沒有忘却其經濟力的運用。關於用政治和軍事掠奪世界市塲的事情，我們暫且不說。在這裏我們只說一說用經濟力爭奪市塲的一般情勢，列强利用其優越的經濟力以掠奪世界市塲的事實，在一九三四年表現得最爲明顯。今略舉幾件重要的事實如次：</p>
<p>（一）通貨膨脹　紙幣流通額的多少，是表現通貨膨脹最好的實例。今將世界主要國的紙幣流通額列表如次：</p>
<p>日本　英國　德國　法國　美國　　發券額　流通額　流通額　流通額　流通額　　百萬元　百萬鎊　百萬馬克　百萬佛郎　百萬美金一九一三年　　　　　四二六　　三○　二、七四二　　五、七一四　三、三六四一九三三年一月　一、一○九　三五五　三、二七一　八三、五九一　二、六九七　　　　　四月　一、○二五　三七六　三、四二三　八四、六二三　三、四七七　　　　　七月　一、一○二　三七八　三、三三八　八三、九○七　三、○六七　　　　　十月　一、一○一　三七一　三、四二六　八一、六六八　二、九九四一九三四年一月　一、一五○　三六六　三、三五四　八○、八三八　二、九六○　　　　　二月　一、二○七　三六六　三、二九五　八一、三九三　二、九五三　　　　　三月　一、○八七　三七○　三、三五七　八一、九三八　二、九八九　　　　　四月·一、一一九　三七四　三、四二九　八一、六三一　三、○三○　　　　　五月　一、○七五　三七八　三、四六一　八一、○八八　三、○六一　　　　　六月　一、○六工　三七九　三、四八五　八○、七八九　三、○五四　　　　　七月　一、一一○　三八五　三、五九六　八一、八九二　三、○九八　　　　　八月　一、一一○　三八四　三、五九四　八一、○○○　三、一○二　　　　　九月　一、○四九　三七九　三、六六二　八一、○一七　三、一四八　　　　　十月　一、一二四　三七七　三、六九七　八○、三四八　三、一八二　　（據「世界往何處去」一九三四年上半期五七頁下半期四○頁）　　各國紙幣的發行額和流通額，較歐戰前前增加很多，一九三三年與三四年比較，增加之數雖很微小，因爲有公債的彌補。而各國債務，現在都有飽和的現象，今後的赤字、旣不能更取之於公債，勢必更擴大通貨膨脹的範圍，這是値得我們注意的。</p>
<p>（二）匯兌貶價壓低的匯兌價格，實爲獎勵對外輸出的最好方法，看各國匯兌的變動吧。（一）世界主要國對美匯兌的新舊平價</p>

<p>······讀徐道鄰「中日關係的檢討」書後······</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>來國人對於中日問題，總不免有兩種習氣：其一是　張，其二是消沉，在人民中間，固然如此，在政府裏頭，也不免如此，這是今日國民心理最大的危樓，應該矯正的。</p>
<p>犯第一種習氣的人，明明知道，力量不够，却不肯說，滿口只是高調。道様做法，不但欺人，而且自欺。須知道，中日糾紛，寃結不解，只就中日之戰算起，已過了整整四十年，即從九一八到現在、也已經四個年頭了。這種局面，絕不是幾句空空洞洞的標語口號所能求得解决的。不從根本上打算，大言壯語、只有好聽。一些也沒有用處。何况五分鐘熱度，如冰消，如雪釋，事過境遷，储諸遺忘，而虚憍之氣，不旋踵已　呢！至於那些意氣用事的人，借對外爲政爭的工具，本來就已置國難於不顧，更不用說了。</p>
<p>犯第二種習氣的人，剛剛相反。他們知道軍事力量不如人，國際地位不如人，政治力量不如人，經濟力量不如人，激於外患，重以内憂，和旣不可而戰又不能，困憊顚躓之餘，精神憔悴了，意志也頽唐了，徬徨失措，如孤舟漂泊於斷潢絕港之間，徼命安之，率性任之，简　付之，曾不思所以自拔，一談對日，或則椎心泣血而不敢言，或則忍氣呑聲而不願言，其甚者則抱顱護頸，如待縶刲，閉目搖首，如作順民，人雖未死而心理已死，國雖未亡而亡國之想像，已深中於人心，勢之可危，事之可痛，、孰逾於此！</p>
<p>我讀了徐道鄰君「敵乎？友乎？」一文之後，我所最佩服的，他沒有犯着這兩種毛病，他肯坦白的指出中國方面的錯誤，和日本方面的錯誤，并且說出「日本人終究不能作我們的敵人，我們中國亦究竟須有與日本携手之必要，」進而提出中日兩國所應採的途徑。</p>
<p>我以爲到了今日，中日兩國人士，都應該有徐君一様的態度，不爲環境所驅，不爲情感所閉，誠意的，平心靜氣的，來求中日問題之根本解决。我希望因徐君這一篇文字，能够引起國人對於中日間問題公開的討論，更能够引起日本人的注意，而促其覺悟。</p>
<p>我願意就我個人所感覺得到的，與徐君商榷，并以之就正於國人。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>徐君所提出打開中日　局的辦法，約有三點：</p>
<p>（一）中國方面，「祇要日本有誠意謀解决，中國祇須要求放棄土地侵略歸還東北四省，其他方式，不必拘泥，過去懸案，應以誠意謀互利的解决，呈掃國交上的障礙」。</p>
<p>（二）日本方面，「應切實表示其「保全中國統一」且「對於中國之獨立或利益不予以阻礙且無加害意思」(日外務省聲明及廣田談話中語)兩語的誠意，斷然歸還東北四省，使歸屬於中國的版圖，一面解决中日兩國之間的懸案」。</p>
<p>（三）打開中日僵局的主動，當然在日本」所以「這種交涉，當然應由日本率先提議，但無妨由兩國直接談判，定議以後，即由中國報告國聯。······』。</p>
<p>如何提議，如何談判，如何報告，這是僵局可希望打開以後的話，暫且不表。在徐君所提出的辦法之中最要注意的，有一個先决問題，我所認爲有商榷之必要的，也就是這個問題。這個問題，不能解决，則所謂解决，依然全沒解决，所謂途徑，依然路不通行。</p>
<p>照徐君的意思，似乎中日兩國，爲敵爲友，論起責任，中國佔十分之四，日本佔十分之六。然則假定中國願與日本爲友了，其可决的程度，不過十分之四，如果日本一定不與中國爲友，而其否决的程度，却有十分之六，如此怎麽辦呢？</p>
<p>徐君說：解鈴還仗繫鈴人。這解鈴繫鈴，自然全在日本，怎様解法呢？徐君又說：應由日本率先提議歸還東北四省。</p>
<p>如果日本不歸還東北四省，又怎麽辦呢？　　是否日本不歸還東北四省，中國就與日本爲敵呢？今日以前，日本並未歸還東北四省，中國對日「敵乎！友乎？」今日以後，日本若不歸還東北四省，中國對日「敵乎？友乎？」</p>
<p>日本肯自動歸還東北四省，自然再好沒有了；但是，日本肯不肯呢？擺在我們面前，很明白的有兩個事實：</p>
<p>其一，日本對東北四省的態度至好我們承認僞滿，由事實的承認，進而至於正式的承認，從二十年九一八佔領東北起至二十二年國聯議决不承認僞滿時止，日本所努力的是要使我們承認僞滿。國聯議决之後，他知道承認僞滿是沒有希望的了，所以一面退出國聯，使决議無效，一面於歷次的談判，處處伏着一個陷阱要我們自投羅網，做出事實上承認僞滿的　疑，到了後來，看看中國當局不會上當，並此事實的承認也做不到了，於是更加一意孤行，索性挣脫一切束縳，撕毁一切公約，九國公約不要了，海軍條約也廢止了，許多人義笑日本，說他自陷孤立，日本誠然孤立了，可是，中國又怎麽様呢？九一八以來，我們盼望與國帮忙，與國在那裏？我們盼望國聯制裁，制裁了些什麽？最抵限度，九國公約對於保障遠東和平多少有一些責任，和效用，如今也絕望了。孫子說：上兵伐謀，其次伐交，中國今日所處的正是這様的境地。如果我們說日本自陷於孤立，事實上中國正是被陷於孤立。以一個孤立的積弱者，對一個孤立的强國，其形勢之懸殊，眞不可以同日而語。</p>
<p>其二，日本向來的態度是得寸進尺，沒有止境的。中日戰後要了台灣及澎湖列島，偷生的中國人，以爲可以苟安了，而日俄戰後又要朝鮮，偷生的中國人以爲這一回可以苟安了，而九一八之役又要東北，其後又要熱河，以後還不知要到那裏！須知道，佔領東北不過是日本「向大陸進出的一個階梯」，不過是大陸政策的一個「出脚點」。所謂「向大陸進出」對於日本終極的利害究竟如何，姑不具論，但在日本人沒有覺悟以前，他經營了五六十年的大陸政策是一定要用死力來貫澈的。日本人常說：「大陸纔是大和民族的眞使命」，「大和民族豈能雌居於面積極小資源極貧的幾個海島」。照他們老早預定了的計劃，她還要隨國勢之發展而遷都，由東京而朝鮮南端，由朝鮮南端而大同江畔，由大同江畔而深入滿蒙，她還要「以中國本部滿蒙及西伯利亞爲背景左右擁日本海與中國海」以把握東亞商權，　還要由九州（筑豐煤礦區）本土（常盤煤礦區）而朝鮮而滿蒙而華北，以獨佔東亞工業，我們對之，可怎麽様呢？</p>
<p>以上所設，一是日本的根本國策，一是日本對於東北四省的態度，由後一點，則中國今後有多少求生的機會尙不可知，何况東北！由前一點，就算不問將來，只顧現在，日本肯不肯歸還東北四省，實在是一大疑問。有人以爲日本各黨派對於佔領東北四省的態度是不一致的，這話不錯，在日本未佔領東北四省以前，日本各黨派的意見，本有多少出入，但在旣然奪取到手之後，他們知道是這麽容易的一回事，如何便肯輕輕丢了。他們對於怎様統治僞滿，怎様併呑僞滿的方法，儘管有輕重緩急之不同，但對於維持其所謂「國民曾流血埋骨所得之權益一，是舉國一致的。我們可以說，照現時日本的情形，無論任何黨派，希望他肯放棄東北四省，都是白想，年荒時凶，何必想食肉糜！</p>
<p>或者我們可以說，「日本爲東方民族，應該明瞭東方心理，東方人的特性，尤其是中國人，就是重感情，重氣節，重禮貎與道義」，「爲澈底更新中日關係，應抛棄武力而注重文化的合作，應舍棄土地侵略而代以互利的經濟提携，應吐棄政洽控制的企圖而以道義感情相結合」。只是，這些說話，日本人說得多了。日本人不是正在責中國太不講道義，太不講感情嗎？日本人不是開口中日文化合作，閉口中日經濟提携嗎？爲什麽直到現在，這些說話還談不到呢？因爲癥結未去暌隔猶存，這些說話在人都是有作用的，在我都是白說的，而欲去此癥結，破此暌隔，還需要無限的努力，絕不是一兩句道義情感甜頭的說話所能爲力的。</p>
<p>我們又可以說，歸還東北四省，并不是沒有代價的，解决懸案就是一個有價値的交換條件。於此，我又不能不回想到九一八前後的情形了。九一八事變未發生以前，日本人以解决懸案相要，我們激於意氣，玩忽了事，致成大錯，無可諱言，但如今要走回到九一八以前的情形，是否還有可能呢？九一八事變發生以後，我們也說過恢復原狀開始交涉的話，但有什麽效果麽？還不是一天遷延一天，原狀始終不能恢復，而交涉却不能不進行嗎？</p>
<p>所謂先歸還東北，再交涉懸案，日本不歸還東北，我們對之可怎麽様呢？不但如此，東北也不歸還，懸案也要交涉，我們對之，又怎様呢？</p>
<p>不但如此，就使進一步，日本肯考慮東北問題了，而所謂交涉懸案，外務省夾袋中必有所謂二十一條欵，有所謂中日　定書，有所謂中「滿」日攻守同盟，我們對之，又怎麽様呢？　　「敵乎？友乎？」我們走的，依然是一條循環往復沒有起止的圓路，不能够跳出這條圓路，中日間的僵局是永遠不會打開的。（未完）</p>

<p>— 杜鵑</p>
<p>農村裏的同胞，爲了天災，兵災，匪災········的種種蹂躪，不得不在死神的手掌下屈服。那些僥倖而留得生命的，也走到了絕對貧窮的地步：典衣服，當器具，賣田地房屋，甚至把兒女都賣掉了。他們好像陷入了淤泥中，却是愈陷愈深；衣食住的消費到了絕境，這五百餘萬的一羣呵，在朔風中呼籲！</p>
<p>住在都市裏的我們，眞幸福極了。旣無兵匪災的波及，終年在快樂和平安中過日子。但，好像在天堂上的我們，只要稍一抬頭，望見了這嚴重的災情，這許多憔悴的餓，試問能否安心？</p>
<p>俗語說：「人非草木，孰能無情。」何况災民還是我們的同胞哩！我們應怎様拯救他們於水火之中；雖然我們的力量有限，但在可能的範圍之内，我們應努力地替他們募捐，替他們請命，也是爲國家和大衆出力，以盡我們小國民的一份責任。</p>

<p>— 矜細</p>
<p>普恩加賚是法國的大總統，他於歐戰時逝世，平時法國人公認普恩加賚是一個偉大的愛國者，并且信賴他是能够支拄危難的大政治家，當歐戰方烈法處境日惡之時，普恩加賚逝世的噩粍傳出後，引起了全法國人的震驚與悲悼。</p>
<p>普恩加賚是極端的愛國主義者，是一個不折不撓的民族主義的信仰相擁護者，他在幼年的時候，目擊横暴的普魯士軍隊佔據了他的故鄕，稚弱的心田裏就湧起極度的憤慨和不平，這確定了他將來矢忠祖國愛護領士的志願，到後來在回憶錄上寫着一段話：「我看不出我之生存於世上究有若何意義，除非是有爲着達到收復已失去的土地這一種希望。」可知他一生永遠沒有忘記幼時普魯士軍隊佔據他故鄕的一種慘酷的印象。</p>
<p>我不希望小朋友將來都成大政治家普恩加賚，但今日日本刧持了我們的東北四省，小朋友可曾像普恩加賚把慘痛恥辱的印象保持在你們的記憶中沒有？</p>

<p>— 蔭</p>
<p>小朋友···你們在放鞭砲的時候，是否想到「鞭砲怎麽會劈劈拍拍響」的問題嗎？我來告訴你，這是火藥爆炸的響聲。</p>
<p>火藥是硝和木炭及硫磺混合製成的。用百分之七十五的硝，百分之十五的木炭末，再加百分之十的硫磺，就可以做成火藥。火藥本來是我國先發明的，經過亞拉伯人的研究，就發明戰爭時利用火藥。近來，一切兵器上，應用火藥的，便日益加多了。</p>
<p>我們在放鞭砲的時候，就看見有一道黑烟，帶了觸鼻的氣味。這是黑色有烟火藥。另外有一種無烟火藥，它最先發現的，是火　棉花。製造的方法也很简單，只要把棉花浸到硝酸和硫酸的混合汁裏，讓棉花儘量的吸收硝酸和硫酸，等浸爱了以後，榨去液汁，用水漂凈，到沒有酸味的時候，使它乾燥，乾燥以後，就能應用了。可是製造時很危險，而且棉花易吸收潮濕，所以化學家悉心研究，改良，進步到現在所用的無烟火藥。</p>
<p>各國所用的無烟火藥，製法絕不相同，而且製法嚴守秘密，我們中國，還沒有人發明製造無烟火藥哪！</p>
<p>火藥本是預備拿來戰爭上應用品，利用它摧殘人類的生命，和毁壞建築物，好像是可怕的東西。不過，它能炸毁巖石，在築路，開隧道，開礦山的時候，郤非利用它不可的。</p>
<p>小朋友！你們玩着一件東西的時候，希望常常推究它的原因，製造方法，所用的原料，這様，對於你的智識，會有　大的帮動啊！</p>

<p>— 秋心</p>
<p>今年是猪年，所以我便不期然的想出了這個「猪尾巴呢？」的遊戲來貢獻給我親愛的小同胞們，作一個春節的禮物。</p>
<p>這遊戲非常简便、小朋友們要玩的時候，最好預先約幾個同學來一起玩，那末更有興趣了。它的方法祗要用一張大的圖畫紙，畫上一隻沒尾巴的猪兒，貼在牆上，再預備了一條紙尾巴，放在附近。然後大家揀一個人出來，將那條尾巴交給他，上面挿了一支别針，於是把他的眼睛用一方手帕蒙起來，把他的身體轉幾轉，（不得過多，否則頭暈難免）呌他把那條尾兒給這個猪兒接起來。等他憑着他自己的記憶，想像去接的時候，便能引人發笑；因爲一百次中有九十九次或全是接錯了的。並且接的時候，只准用一隻手，你想旣不許用法子探出猪的所在，眼看他亂接，並且一個人接了，旁的人便也依次照様的去接，那不是很有趣的玩意嗎？况且還可作爲一種競賽，誰接上了尾巴，使可得獎。</p>

<p>— 何公超</p>
<p>赛假期内的玩具</p>
<p>學校放寒假了，小朋友們將在家裏住十多天，在這十幾天裏面，如果沒有玩具玩，那是多麽煩悶啊。科學先生今天上台，是特地來告訴小朋友們自己製造兩種玩具的方法的。</p>
<p>科學先生一上台，就把手裏的一顆橄欖給小朋們看，說道：</p>
<p>「我們的玩具要自己製造，買來的玩具是不希奇的。這種橄欖，只要有三顆，就可以做成很有趣味的玩具了。」科學先生一面說，一面取出一把小刀來，繼續說道：「用小刀削去橄欖的半截，留着核；再用自來火梗兩根，把它們的兩端削尖，一端挿上一根小橄欖，再把另一端分左右挿在削去半截的橄欖上：這様，隨便把橄欖核的尖端放在什麽地方，都不會倒下來，這不是很好玩麽？」科學先生邊說邊做，不多一會，這玩具就成功了；把它放在指尖上，果然，隨便怎様搖動，都不會倒下來。　　「爲什麽不會倒下來呢？這是重心作用的關係。關於重心作用，我們有幾件事必須知道：（一）物體放在某處，支持物體的地方，呌做支點（例如一個墨水瓶放在檯上，瓶底就是支點）（二）支點越大物體越不容易倒，（墨水瓶放樹上，瓶底大，所以不容易倒，如果把它倒轉來，瓶頸變成支點，就容易倒了）（三）重心越下，物體越不易倒（墨水瓶正放着時，重心在瓶的下部，所以不容易倒，倒轉來時，重心移到上部，就容易倒了。）（四）重心出了支點，物體必倒。（人站着時，兩足是支點，我們如果太向前俯，或太向後仰，那時全身的重心，越出於支點以外，身體就要跌倒了。）（五）重心若在支點以下，支點雖小　物體也不倒。（剛才做成的橄欖玩具，核尖是支點，牠的重心却在支點下的空中，所以亦不到。）</p>
<p>「不倒翁也是應用了重心作用的原理面製成的。我們在寒假期内也可以自己來製造。先用厚紙捲成圓管，兩頭也用紙糊起來，底部須糊成圓形，並且放一塊圓形的鉛在底裏；（用膠水黏牢）外面再隨你的意思給上一點圖像；這様，這東西就永遠不會跌倒，你撳它下去，一放手，它又站起來了。因爲放了鉛塊，把全體的重心移在很下很下的地方，因此它就不會倒了。丨丨這種自製的玩具，花錢很少，而且可以學習一些科學知識，比較買洋貨玩具要有意思得多了」</p>

<p>（一）綿羊是脊椎動物裏的反芻偶蹄類，它的嘴巴和眼睛很小，尾巴也很短，性情温和，喜歡羣居，吃的是草料。它的毛又軟，又長，又密，又鬈曲，好做皮袍子來穿，也可做毛絨綫和毛織物。小朋友現在冷天到了，你們穿什麽東西，才能不怕冷呢？</p>
<p>（二）螺角羊是脊椎動物裏的反芻偶蹄類，產在西班牙和澳洲。它是綿羊改良的羊種，頭上生着一對彎曲的角，很像螺旋一様，所以呌做螺角羊。它們的體質很强壯，毛也很細美，可做皮袍和毛絨綫和毛織物。</p>
<p>（三）原羊是脊椎動物裏的反芻偶蹄類，住在歐洲阿爾卑斯山的山頂上。它的角有三尺多長，像竹枝一様。它們也很像山羊，但它是野生的，喜歡羣居，它們以五頭到十多頭做一羣，由一隻老羊公做領導。小朋友能够像它們這様合羣團結嗎？</p>
<p>（四）羚羊是脊椎動物裏的反芻偶蹄類，它們常常一羣一羣住在深山裏。它的様子像山羊，又像鹿，它的嘴很尖，四條腿又細又長，能跑得快。頭上生着一對很短的角，身體長有四尺。因它的角可做藥材，皮可做皮料，所以它的皮和角都很貴。小朋友你們祇要到藥店裏或皮料店裏去，就可以看到它們的角和皮的形狀了！</p>

<p>我見自己此刻已在四面都是山的一個深谷之中。這些山非常之高。山頂沒在雲中。四下裏沒有出路，全是峻峭的巖石，所以我比先前的境地更惡劣了。</p>
<p>我向四周行走了一次，見那地上散滿着很好的寳石，有的是極大的。但我所見的還不止這個丨因爲過去些還有幾尾大蛇，我瞧了大喫一驚。他們是何等的大，那最小的，也能一餐喫一頭很大的獸類。</p>
<p>他們終日躱在窟穴中，因爲很怕大鵬，但他們夜間便出來了。我在這谷中上下走着，度過了一天。我找到了一個山洞，夜中就爬了進去，我以爲在洞中可以安全了。</p>
<p>那洞口很小，我進去後便把一塊大石堵住了缺口，不給蛇進來。我喫了些東西，却害怕得不能入睡；終夜聽得那些大蛇的嘶聲。</p>
<p>天明時我走出山洞來。只因怕蛇過甚，好久沒想到脚邊散着那些可貴的寳石</p>
<p>日間不用再怕蛇了，所以我便坐下來休息，可是我早就和你们說，我終夜沒有合過眼啊。不久我熟睡了。我一跳又醒了過來，因爲聽得有甚麽東西掉在我近邊，做出一種很大的聲響。那時我却見有大塊的肉從山頂上紛紛的抛擲下來</p>

<p>婦女園地創刊一週年紀念</p>
<h3 id="c291">一個小小的希望 <a href="#c291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— 蔡慕暉</p>
<p>記不清楚是「再生緣」，「筆生花」，「天雨花」，或其他的什麽「·········」了，在那位作者寫到某一段落的時候，因着要做過年的瑣事擱筆了很久，在她再度拿起筆來時，已經是元宵之後，她就將她自己那一段的家庭生活挿寫在小說中。在一位傳統觀念很重的文藝批評者看來，也許會說這是不合小說作法的，是絕對不應該有的舉動，但在我這看生活比文藝更重的人，却得了一個極深刻的印象。到現在，離開我看那小說的時候也許已經足足二十年了，那小說中的故事已差不多忘得一乾二凈，但作者的這一段挿話却還很活躍鮮明。這大槪是因爲對婦女生活，向來祇有抽象式的評論式的或虚構故事式的論文或小說的紀載，絕少家常便話式的素描的緣故罷？這種素描，在有些人看來，雖則是太質樸，但在留心實生活的人看來，則覺得比無論什麽其他的文章都有價値些。</p>
<p>這一年來，除開幾個有特别事故佔住我的注意力的星期日早晨外，差不多每期的婦女園地我都看見的。有時候看見好些秀色可餐的奇花異卉，固然呌我愛得不忍釋手，有時候祇看見幾枚質樸憔悴的平凡草葉，也常呌我翻覆觀賞。我覺得自己的心境，好像當日丁尼生（Ｔennyson)鑒賞生長在獄牆隙縫裏的青草一様，覺得細看那一支、简單的草兒，就能滲透宇宙間的最高哲理似的。原因是和一支眞的青草，比一朶假的花朶更能呌人瞭解生活的眞相；一個和自己的生活能起共鳴的故友的平凡照相，反比桃花或明星的美術照更呌人覺得有仔細觀看的價値一様的。在去年這雜誌年中，我雖則很喜歡好幾種雜誌，但比較的看得最勤的，還是婦女園地，就爲了這一個緣故。</p>
<p>不過對於婦園的將來，我有着更進一步的期望。第一是希望園丁品格的更加豐富多様，除了探討紀述知識婦女的生活和出路外，也更加注意生活在工廠中和田塲中的婦女大衆，如果過着這些生活的本人能够負起自我介紹的責任，自然是更加有意思。第二是希望園中花卉的更加自由生長，不管是「阿大哭着要買花生米，阿二喊着要撒屎，阿大的爹呻吟着要喝開水，而阿大的娘正忙着要爲婦園或其他的刋物寫一篇文章」的婦女生活的一方面，或是「經理先生百　戲弄，經理太太處處猜忌」的婦女生活的另一方面，都能有很眞切信筆所之的寫述，不要太保守紳士氣，將文章寫得太規矩文雅，太像煞有介事，反失去了眞真的風味。</p>
<p>因爲爲知識階級爲有閒階級的婦女們解决問題，消遣光陰的刋物，現在正在一天天加多起來，而那些呻吟在家務與職業的兩重負擔下的姊妹們，却不但沒有工夫來做咬文嚼字佈局練字的細工夫，就是靜靜地坐下來欣賞那些和生活不相干的文彩的工夫也不會有呵！</p>
<p>我眞是欽羨那位二十年前給我以那様眞實印象的女作家，她呌我覺悟到就是一個沒有工夫欣賞花月的俗人也可以寫幾句文章·否則也許到現在，我還會迷信祇有過着天使般不沾塵俗的人，才配弄文墨呢。</p>
<p>爲着想助婦園一週紀念的興，在萬忙中草就了這幾句話，也許祇有忙人看了會贊同我這主張罷？</p>
<h3 id="c292">婦女問題在過去一年 <a href="#c292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>— 碧遙</p>
<p>新歷現今已是二月中了，舊歷郤還是新正初頭；舊的在人們的腦海裏總還有牠的古香，所以一年來浮在古國裏的婦女問題、也依照商家的辦法，結賬到舊歷年底。去年閏了五月，一年十三個月中，在婦女方面，不輕不重地有過這些事件：</p>
<p>最初的一鞭是「婦女國貨年」。年來國事如麻，從亂麻中揀出了一根救國的頭緒，卽是婦女的服用國貨。無如言者諄諄，聽者藐藐；行之半年，而有花邊消耗六十萬，脂粉香水進口八十五萬的報告。於是社會人士，大爲駭然。以爲婦女這般不肯努力，救國的一綫生機，將被斬斷。因而婦女的奇服艶裝，便成了衆矢之的；南北各地，都以取締婦女的裝束爲事。北平還信有舊時的皇家風度，從容大方，祇禁止婦女的赤足裸腿。廣東則更表現了海國的進取精神，進而禁止男女同浴甚至同住，同食，同行。風風雨雨，鬧滿四方。接着產生了治本的辦法，返本歸源，呌她們再回到家庭；如此則不但她們少了艶裝的機會，同時也少了艶裝的能力。於是古老的賢妻良母主義，隨着再生。在這風氣之下，許多前時以培養社會人才爲號召的女校，都紛紛試辦賢妻良母的敎育。雖有少數人在那兒討論「出走後的娜拉怎様？」然而時勢是明白地告訴我們　「呌她轉回家來！」</p>
<p>家，大家一夥兒注重到家，便發生了家庭的安全各和社會的風化的問題，於是而鬧了一個很長的尾巴。由取締婦女的裝飾，分别歌女的佩章，拘留拉客的雉妓，直到立法院堂堂皇皇地訂定處罰有夫之婦與人通姦的條文，而轟上了最高的潮頭。當時京滬各地，組織了不少的婦女團體，力爭平等的法律。數十日之間，奔走呼號，卒由處罰「有夫之婦與人通姦」的片面的刑法，修改爲「有配偶而與人通姦者處一年以下有期徒刑」。沈默了多時任人毁譽的婦女，這時算起來爭得了條文上的勝利。</p>
<p>刑法上獲得了平權的婦女，他方面可又如何？下層社會賣妻鬻女的慣事，且不去管牠；單說自由較多，桎梏較少的上層社會，在歲暮的幾日中，連出了兩件大事。一是黎故總統元洪的遺妾危文繡女士，改嫁給商人王葵軒，致引起黎氏親族的責駡，更遭湖北同鄕義憤　的聲討，終而至於受青島政府的驅逐出境。一是前浙江省政府主席魯滌平在京逝世，其妾沙氏墮樓殉節。危女士寄身齋魯禮義之邦，當此粤南大張「節婦宴」之日毁節再醮，致動公憤（？）殊爲憾事；沙女士雖居末世，而能以身殉夫，社會人士，當可默然致敬。這兩事一辱一榮，合奏了甲戍婦婦女年的尾聲。</p>
<p>總觀去年一年中的所謂婦女問題，與北伐時期的大不相同。彼時的婦女水火方深，問題的中心，是在攪醒她們如何解放思想上習慣上的束縳；如何攫取職業，攫取經濟的權利；如何向壓迫者，帝國主義者鬥爭。她們是對舊日的思想，制度，權勢，一切，雄視闊步，毫無忌憚。然而去年郤不需要這種典型的女性，去年所需要的女性，是幽嫺貞淑，端莊順從。她們的價値，不在她們本身的能力和對社會的貢獻，而在她們映入客觀的眼底的影像。故着眼在她們的衣料，在她們衣服的尺寸，在她們的頭髮，在她們的皮鞋，在她們的貞潔，在她們的······假如將北伐期間所鼓勵成的女性比爲牝獅，則去年所要求的女性可比爲綿羊。前者適合於荆棘叢林中衝鋒陷陣，後者適合於桑圜草徑裏優游自得。時勢推移，反映在女性上面有這般的差别！</p>
<p>去年婦女問題的舊賬大致是這麽結束，可有人以爲滿足，或有人以爲失意嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c293">婦園一週年 <a href="#c293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>一般的婦女，尙在雙重壓迫下討生活，中國是次殖民地，中國婦女，更是在三重壓迫下維持生命！在這情形下產生的園地，牠的不健全，是可想而知的。</p>
<p>我們初獲得的園地，不但是冰雪載道，更是瓦礫滿塲，怎蒔得佳種？然而我們終於勇敢地開墾一年了。雖然青石板下長的嫩芽，不免歪曲孱弱，但我們並不悲觀，也不感傷。盡可能地灌漑着，耕耘着；一年來慘淡的經營，談不到成效，說不上收穫。但在此沉寂的空氣中，能聽到一二滯重的鋤頭聲，在那荒漠的廢墟上，似乎已能見到些許的嫩芽與綠葉，雖歪曲的苗芽，先天下足；但只要後天不失調，不枉受摧殘，不難望它蒼葱成林，在這個希望下，想將一年來的工作，作一简略的報告，一來盡了報賬的義務，二來借此回顧旣往，兼展望將來。以下是一筆工作简報。</p>
<p>（一）鑑於過去「婦運」的息爾銷沉，我們喊出過重掀「後浪」。預期一九三五年的「後浪」，當大於去年的微波；</p>
<p>（二）隨着革命浪濤的潛伏，本已出走的「娜拉」，一個個在回家。當「婦女們回家」的口號，傳到我們這亞東大陸的時候，我們的園地上，曾有過一次大論戰，結論是，不但未來的新中國的新女子，不是竈下婢，守家奴，男子的玩物，卽在此過渡時代的女子，也得盡力地去努力做「社會人」。</p>
<p>（三）過去一年，婦女的服着，梳裝，似乎特别被人們注意，然而一般下層婦女，她們只是站在生死的界綫上求生，够不上講怎麽梳裝，怎麽衣着，她們的生活，許是一般人沒有體騐，不明白；所以借園地的一角，常揭示她們生活的素描，惜乎缺少統計，更限於環境，未便露骨。</p>
<p>（四）對「三從四德」的奴化霉菌，「從一而終」的封建餘骸，努力剷除，嚴防阻碍嫩芽綠枼的枉被損傷。</p>
<p>（五）世界大思想家的言論，是時代的前趨與透視，他們對婦女問題的意見如何，正是我們蒔種的參考資料，此外名人傳記，可作我們的借鑑。過去已揭載過不少，此後仍希望繼續。</p>
<p>（六）婦女問題中最重要的，當推育兒問題，曾出過專號。對兒童公育，有多次的討論，認爲託兒所，已爲現社會必需的事項。</p>
<p>（七）出過個專號，其中以「我理想中的未來生活，」最有趣味，徵稿的結果，知道雖慒懂者多，清醒者也大有人在頗可樂觀。</p>
<p>（八）爭法運動，起自南京，繼自各地，我們在後方的園地上，出搖旗助勢過，同時希望繼爭法的精神，來推動那根本的重壓。</p>
<p>（九）「五四」以來，知識婦女的在社會舞台上呈露頭角，最惹人注意的，當推各作家與她們的作品了，現在對她們的作品，重新作正確的評價，不但給作者丨丨指活着的而論丨丨可自我檢討，與讀者更有無窮的裨益。此後仍希望各批評家多多賜稿。</p>
<p>（十）爲調節枯燥的硬性文字，每期盡可能地挿些軟性寫作。與常識之類。</p>
<p>以上是認爲可特别提出來報告的，至於詳細工作，只得從略了。</p>
<p>過去的工作與期望，旣如上述，今後除繼續慘淡經營，力圖發表，最近想添做的工作，也想再來預告一下：</p>
<p>（一）恢復「讀者通訊，」來做些切實的指導工作。並已請定律師，作法律上的顧問。讀者可來函詢問。當盡力答復。</p>
<p>（二）多多介紹些應讀的有益書報，希望它成一園地裏的明燈，免得求知者的暗中摸索。</p>
<p>（三）特闢婦女問題講座，用最淺顯的文字，對婦女問題，作简易的，系統的講話。使一般人都知道婦女問題的所以成問題，及此後的歸趨。</p>
<p>（四）多載國内外婦女實生活的素描。</p>
<p>（五）搜集國内外婦運消息。充實園地見聞。</p>
<p>一年來的經營，雖然自問尙勇敢地工作着，但限於能力，迫於環境，不能使它成爲美滿的園地，還望讀者合力來耕耘，使這小小園地，得更繁榮滋長！</p>
<h3 id="c294">一九三四年的一齣悲劇農村破產與農村婦女 <a href="#c294" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e294" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">294</a></h3>
<p>— 君慧</p>
<p>「農村破產！」這是目前全國人民哀呼悲鳴的可怕的絕呌！也就是無數農民大衆所排演的一幕最殘酷的社會的悲劇！這幕悲劇的擴大與深入，已經成爲整個國民的生死存亡之問題。任憑怎様喜歡粉飾太平或者高興贊美現狀的人都好，總不能否認這悲劇在全國各地不斷的表演着！而在這一驚人的悲劇中，農村婦女就是占着主要位置的角色！</p>
<p>這一幕悲劇，大約是從帝國主義的商品經濟攻破萬里長城而侵入到中國農村的時候開始扮演　一直到現在，其劇情一天天的緊張起來！於是乎，在台下的看衆們，固然要昨舌吁歎，甚至於這悲劇的編者及導演者們，也要來提倡什麽救濟，什麽復興！然而這一切就不外是要掩沒這殘酷的事實的滑稽戲罷了！但這極度緊張的悲劇塲面，無論如何是緩和不了的！</p>
<p>特别在過去一年中，農村經濟的破產，困着空前的水旱災的交互肆　而加速了牠的廣度與深度，據本報八月廿一日南　電　　災　　區　　已普遍到全國三分二以上，受旱災影響　有十四省三四三縣，受水災影響的有十三省，此外還有八省六八縣受蝗患，十二省八九縣受雹霜災，總計損失在十億元以上。」在這可驚的數字背面，我們可以隱約的看到無數的農民羣衆在死亡的黑綫底下流離顚沛的情狀。</p>
<p>占全國農民的半數之農村婦女，在這一激烈破產的悲劇中，扮演出更加慘酷的節目。我想在這裏利用若干的報紙上的資料，简單的說明她們所扮演出來的劇情。</p>
<p>第一是出外傭工的，農村婦女在飢寒交迫之中唯一的出路就是跑到都市來當女工，但都市的工業受着不景氣的影響，正在一批一批的裁减工人，甚至於倒閉廠門，那裏還有地方收留他們？於是她們便加入薦頭行，當女傭的後備軍。</p>
<p>據九月二日大美晚報載，「今年江蘇各縣旱災甚烈，以至秋收無望，農民等糧食發生恐慌，益以連所農村破產之結果，各縣婦女均紛紛來滬尋找職業，皆入女傭介紹所候人僱用，而能得職業者僅佔十分之四，其餘皆挨餓閒坐，據經詳細調查，全上海之傭役介紹所，共有五百餘所，每一介紹所平均欲得女傭職者有三十五人至四十人之間，每日能得職業者僅佔極少數，統計欲謀女傭職者超過二千餘名云」</p>
<p>又據七月十六日大公報江浦通訊，「本邑入夏不雨，旱象已呈，縣屬西南區一帶婦女，因口糧無出，連日紛紛出外傭工，以求一飽，結隊離鄕，狀似逃難，情至可憫云。」</p>
<p>貧苦婦女在鄕村富有之家當女傭，其情形更加慘酷，例如西安近郊的農婦，「多在富有之家充當傭役，所得工資每年除主人供給膳宿外僅得五元之資，而其所食多係主人之剩餘，主人食麥麵，而苦工所食者多係雜糧，故一家之内一日兩餐，皆兩種有區别之飲食，故其工作生活，不啻牛馬。」（香港工商日報三月十四日西安特訊）</p>
<p>第二是流爲娼妓的，關於農村婦女流爲娼妓的事實，紀旬君描寫得淋漓盡致</p>
<p>「淮北無論鄕村，城市，都迷漫着毒臭的空氣，明娼暗娼，遍處都是·········剛被土地抛棄了的農村婦女，有的以賣淫爲職業，有的以賣淫爲副業，這中間孤苦伶仃的幼女很多，年齡還不到十四歲，處女的清白便被人蹂躪，失掉了身體的健康，破壞了身體的發育。她們一生的命運，完全操在鴇兒手裏，不過大都還不到成年便給梅瘡斷送了終生！其中也有家庭的主婦，因爲兒女的號寒啼飢，不得已而出賣自己的貞操，換取家庭的消費。」（中華日報一一月二·三日）</p>
<p>娼妓的蔓延程度是和農村破產和不景氣的程度相爲比例的。去年十月間公共租界警務處在一個月内拘獲暗娼達一千數百名，這些就是不景氣與農村破產所造成的現象。</p>
<p>據廣州七十二行報載（去年一月十五日）「南順各絲廠自因絲業不景氣後停業者幾近百家，前此之賴以豐衣足食之數萬繅絲女，今已淪爲失業，此輩女子多染不良風俗，持不落家主義，今已失其生活自主能力，故泰半出爲女傭，其不知自愛者則多移居圩市僻靜地方，暗營醜業。」</p>
<p>南寗民國日報上海通訊（六日十四日）是富於詩意的描寫蘇州女子因農村破產而墮青樓的事實，就是說：「每當電燈初上，野鷄咸肉便塞滿了大小旅館，樓下樓上，前前後後，紅紅綠綠，同時馬路上還有暗娼隨着娘姨奔波勞碌，據說閭門一帶，（城内不算）的這種女人約有二千人，近兩三年來，災荒頻至，農村經濟破產，想來蘇州女人因爲生活的關係，逼着跳火坑的，大槪比前更多，」　第三是被賣爲婢的　在　　支配的社會裏，拍賣　　的現象往往有之，但到目前殘酷的農村經濟破產的過程中，這種現象更爲普遍化。</p>
<p>據東南日報（八月六日）孝豐通訊，「近日城中，鄕人每携子女來城求售，尤以十歲左右之女孩爲多，鬻於富貴人家爲婢女，價至多不過二十元，······」</p>
<p>又據湖州通訊，「浙西諸地，農村日頻破產，詎至今歲旱魃爲災，秋收絕望，同時絲價暴跌，直落至十三四元，農民苦况，無待言喩，其中順馴者野菜樹皮以充飢，賣妻鬻子以償債，待迫至無路，自殺了之，　·········」</p>
<p>第四是自殺的。農村婦女因着生活逼迫炊飯無米，而「投河自殺」，「懸樑自盡」的慘酷事件，在報章上時有所聞，但因篇幅的關係，在此不能舉例，請讀者們原諒。</p>
<p>總而言之，農村破產這幕悲劇中，農村婦女所扮演的節目是特别來得慘酷！農村婦女是佔全國婦女的八％以上，而她們却都是富有勞動能力的生產大衆。</p>
<h3 id="c295">誰是「新女性」？ <a href="#c295" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e295" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">295</a></h3>
<p>— 先</p>
<p>看了「新女性」之後丨</p>
<p>負着生之重負的我，幾曾有一個舒閒的日子給我享受過？是偶然的機緣，把我擠進了金城影戲院，看了聯華二廠攝製的「新女性；」這算是非常幸運的事了</p>
<p>我不想在這裏批評這片子的藝術價値。只因我看完了這片子，發生了一個疑問：究竟誰是「新女性」呢？</p>
<p>在中國現狀之下，眞正的「新女性」產生不出來，正如「新女性」之不能在「新女性」上面表演得出一様。在這片子裏：如果說阿英是「新女性，」她給我們的印象太缺少深刻性，太隱藏了。「她」卽在銀幕上也還不能十分活躍顯要，幾至於使我們不去注意她。</p>
<p>韋明只晚一個「不澈底的，」「落殁的」，「新女性。」她只跳出了有形的舊禮敎的圈子，却終於跳不出無形的舊禮敎的鐵環。她所表演出的身份，是代表什麽階級的婦女？我們在她隱瞞身世的虚榮心，和她所過的那種生活裏，可以看得出的。</p>
<p>韋明的出身，無疑是個世代書香之家的小姐，這在她姐姐對她女兒叙述她從前脫離家庭的奮鬥史一段上看得出來：而且是受過相當敎育的知識份子婦女。這種婦女，中封建思想的毒太深，跳不出那個階級的圈；因爲身份的關係，她就不能像阿英穿着樸質，吃苦耐勞。假若把韋明的地位換給阿英，我相信阿英一定能够處置裕餘，一點不成問題。丨不但孩子能得救，自己不致死，而且她所受着社會的種種侮辱，也早已報復了</p>
<p>韋明把貞操看得這様重，自是這種婦女人格的特徵。她寗忍看着一個聰明活潑的愛女死亡，而終於不肯犧牲自己的貞操，她的自私，到這步田地。所謂「忍辱負重」者，賣貞操和救别人的性命，試想想：那一件事是更能表演出女性人格的高尙，偉大呢？</p>
<p>我並不想鼓動新女性不要貞操，爲了報復，故意去毁壞自己的身體。不過在現狀之下，女性的不幸，是在所難免的；身臨其境的人，權衡輕重：如果不得不犧牲的時候，我們又何必顧惜貞操，而傷大體呢？</p>
<p>阮玲玉在「新女性」所演出的韋明，是一個殁落了的女性；缺乏「勇敢，」「犧」牲「樸質」「耐勞」的，「新女性」的「新精」神」「新道德。」我們的眞正的「新女性」阿英·只在這裏佔了個不重要的位置，未得正面地顯露出來。丨這是看了「新女性」的女性羣應該認識清楚的。</p>

<h3 id="c296">談自學 <a href="#c296" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e296" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">296</a></h3>
<p>— 李安夫</p>
<p>在目前的社會上，有不少從事於職業而感到學識不够的人大家在這様的說着：可惜我是個窮人，少讀了幾年書。或者說：我的父親爲什麽不給我多讀幾年書呢？當我們初聽到這一類的話時，也許會和他表同情，爲他所遭的環境而可惜。然而要是經過了一翻縝密的考慮，就可以發覺他的這種說話，只是口頭上動人的說話而已；其實他的内心並不需要眞的想讀書，或者至少還以爲讀書求學是件怎様困難的事情，這是我們敢斷言的。</p>
<p>我們要是翻開任何一本記載人類成功的書籍，不論中外，不論古今，更不論任何一種學科，其中有大半早年自學甚至苦學的人，却在放着異彩，爲後人所崇拜。無疑地，動人而足以眩人的銜頭資格，也許沒有金錢不能够得到：然而在學業的門外，却並沒有貼着閑人止步的招貼。牠是永遠的聞着大門，歡迎着任何人走進這門口去，决不因了你的貧賤而有所歧視；牠的寛容或許要比菩薩或上帝的賜予更實惠些，更可靠些。從此可知那些自嘆着沒有書讀的人，並不是書籍來拒絕他們，而是他們不想去讀牠。也就是說：在他們的生命之中，並不是沒有讀有書條路，是有了路他們只是站在路旁歎着氣而不想走上去而已。</p>
<p>然而自學是不是絕對沒有條件的呢？有了怎様的條件，才能走上這條自學的路呢？是的，這個條件不但是自學的條件，也就是人生萬種事業成功的秘訣；不用說，那就是專心與有恒了。在我們中國，關於這類的格言和成功者的歷史，幾乎舉不勝舉；就是在海外各國成功者的言行之中，同様了有不少可以爲我們自學者的座右銘的。像司買爾斯說：成功是從克服困難而來的。馬騰說：一個專心的健全的目標，可以醫愈數千種惡疾。金斯萊說：當我着手來做我所做的事的時候，好像世界上再沒有可做的事了。關於這類話說得最透澈的要算卡萊爾了。他說：生物所具的能力雖有强弱的不同，然而能力最弱的人，要是能够集中他所有的能力而專心於一事，那末，就是能力薄弱，也會有相當的成功。反之，一個具有强大能力的人，他若分了心去從事各種事業，他的結果必定一無成就。所以有斷的滴水，可以滴穿巨大的石塊；洶湧着的急流，過後反連痕迹都沒有了。的確，假如我們自學而沒有專心和恒心，那末，最後的結果，正同急流一般的了無痕迹而已。因爲事實告訴我們，眞實的學問才是世界上最公正的東西，假如你缺乏了上面兩種精神，縱然化了金錢，費了時間，去購買，去期待，牠决計不會無條件的賜予給你的。假如我們具了上面這種精神去自學，不要說學業上的成就可以達到最高峯，卽以這種堅忍不㧞的毅力，運用於事業上的發展，也不無相當的帮助呀！</p>
<p>空口呌着要求眞實的學問，决計不會因此而增加你的實學；這正同要想發財而在對門的牆上貼了一張對我生財四個字的無聊一様的正確。坐着詛咒已往機會的失落，也不過詛咒罷了。我們從事職業的人若要想獲得一些眞實的學問，自當努力的去探索，方才能够有所成功。</p>
<p>愛墨生說：世界上除了你自己之外，沒有人能够破壞你的成功。詛咒，歎息，是你自己的破壞；眞的，只有專心努力的求去，才是一條走上成功的途徑。</p>
<p>藝壇</p>
<h3 id="c297">看了兩次歌舞表演 <a href="#c297" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e297" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">297</a></h3>
<p>— 曼雲</p>
<p>丨新華社在金城·飛燕社在卡爾登丨</p>
<p>歌舞界現在還沒有固定的地盤。他們只能趁影片賣座不大好的季節到影戲院裏去「打一打泡」。舊曆年關，人事紛紜，有閒看電影的人們到底太少，影院營業不可免的要遭到影響，就是好的影片怕也難賣到錢了。沒有在這時候拿出好片子來的傻子老板。一些简陋的貨色就必然被塞出來「應景」，歌舞在這種千載一時的好機會中也就可以來一試其身手了。在去年舊曆年關左近，新華在金城，飛燕在卡爾登的登臺其能稍稍哄動一時，也是有着這様的原因的。我看了這兩次表演，對於他們的努力和他們的不以肉感標榜，願致其欽佩之意；但對於他們演出的成績，却不能不有所欲言。現在我且寫出我的一點觀感。</p>
<p>首先我想說到新華。新華是上海歌舞界小有名氣的團體，成立的歷史雖不久，却也有過幾次表現。這個團體的「生意眼」氣味甚濃，平素社員中奔走於電影界播音界的人頗不少，以是新節目的編排每爲時間人才所限制了。過去他們曾把明月社遺留的一些简陋貨色，搬出來送給觀衆；這一次他們同様是缺少新的貢獻的。例如一月二十五日我去看的一塲的節目，就是些什麽「桃花江」「花生米」「公平交易」永别了我的弟弟」「求愛秘訣」「戀愛的心」「特别快車」「茉莉恩鄕」「銀漢雙星」······等，内容上的空虚简陋不用說，就是曲調也大都是陳舊不堪，而很難得到高的評價（黎系歌舞無論在音樂上或是在舞姿上都很難得到高的評價）。値得一提的倒是新華這次用來號召的幾個「人才」。「雷影明星」王人美，「歌星」汪曼傑的「客串」我沒有看到，不好說什麽，但她倆的歌喉大槪是不致使觀衆十分失望的。客串的人們中袁美雲是很能引人注目的一個，這次我看了她和周璇合作的「茉莉思鄕」，和嚴華合作的「桃花江」等　兩個節目。一般人都說袁美雲很有希望，實際上這個「需要灌漑和護植的初萌的嫩芽」也的確有表演天才，若不是爲了無聊人的過譽和生意眼的關係，她是的確有着她的前途。說她是「美麗的小鳥」固然是看輕了她，把她當「搖錢樹」也似乎是沒有遠見。一個眞純的藝人應該拒絕一切非所願的邀請，「掛第一塊牌」也只是那虚榮心切不想進取的人的營謀與行爲。節目方面，在這時候還表演「桃花江」，雖無論演得如何熟練，也無疑是不足道的了。同様，在「茉莉思鄕」中，她和周璇一様有優秀的演出，但這種東西本身沒有多少價値，縱演得好，那又算得什麽呢？爲了要作一筆「買賣」，飛燕社在卡爾登表演時，她和飛燕的路易斯也合演過「賣花詞」，又獨唱過「小茉莉」，我们對這兩個節目的看法也是和上面相同的。此外，陳競芳，江蔓莉等也在新華的表演中客串，她倆的歌喉也都有不可及處，但同様也都有一個毛病，就是吐詞不甚清楚，而所唱的曲調又多是些傷感的「靡靡之音」。</p>
<p>新華的主要演員周璇是一個能歌能舞的人才。她很有天分，可惜她的才能是用得不甚得當罷了。她在「特别快車」中以活潑諧趣的姿態出現，身分適合，成績不差。她在「求愛秘訣」「民族之光」「公平交易」戀愛的心」鳳陽女」中都飾了主要脚色，都能勝任愉快。「公平交易」接觸到了現實的失業問題，可惜這裏是把這問題的嚴肅性滑稽化了。在「鳳陽女」中，她和虞華穿了花花綠綠的舞衣，載歌載舞，我們一點也看不到在天災人禍交相煎迫下脫離故鄕的鳳陽女的飄泊生活的痛苦。而這種無視現實生活的態度却是新華節目的一個共通的特色！</p>
<p>飛燕在卡爾登的表演，雖營業上有如新華多多，但他們對歌舞的認識比新華或許要進步一此。他們很想擺脫黎式的「粉腿如林」「酥胸半露」的傳統，企圖以新的形式與内容來改變歌舞界的傾向。他們大量的採用異國情調的節目，其中如「吉布西舞」「哥薩克舞」「宮闈豔舞」「匈牙利舞」「軍艦巡禮」······都很能引人注目。就中尤以「吉布西舞」的配合着一種雄健的音律與舞姿，「哥薩克舞」的通過粗野的音律而透露一種壯健於外形，都很能使人感到一種興奮，一種力量。此外，新編的「賣布謠」，也相當表現了下層社會人們生活的一面。至於徐粲鶑和黃昏客串的「蠻荒舞」，雖表演熟練，但這種内容的東西，無論如何是不能不令人皺眉的。</p>
<p>飛燕的表演中還有一個節目不能不一提的是三幕歌舞劇「沙塲血淚」。「沙塲血淚」雖採取了義勇軍抗敵的現實題材，但這種題材爲這個戲的編排不當所毁壞了。這個戲，嚴格的說，是雜凑成功的，沒有情感過程，沒有情節聯繫，沒有完整故事·········就是挿進去的舞蹈歌曲等，也顯得是東拼西凑，牽强生硬的呢。</p>
<p>飛燕的前途甚有希望，我們希望牠的構成人員能够反省，一面也希望牠能接受外界的批評，把歌舞藝術建立在一種不麻醉觀衆，不粉飾現實的境界裏。在這時候去「歌舞昇平」當然是一種「時代錯誤」；歌舞决不是牧師嘴裏的讚美詩，也不是眼睛吃的冰淇淋，而不得不是客觀現實的表演。</p>

<h3 id="c299">怎様寫作文學作品？ <a href="#c299" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e299" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">299</a></h3>
<p>— 王集叢</p>
<p>如果你是一個愛好文學的青年學生或中小職員，你想學習寫作文學作品，或者是你正在寫作文學作品的時候，那麽，在你的腦筋中必然要發生一個問題：怎様寫作呢？我現在想和你來討論的就是這個問題，想來這對於你是件樂意的事情吧。</p>
<p>首先，要想寫作小說，詩歌或戲劇，便非具有寫作的技術的才能不可。如果你不知道怎様描情寫境，沒有描畫事物的藝術的才能，那是不能寫作文學作品的。但這藝術才能並不是來自天賦，而是要靠你後天的培養。在這當中，我希望你不要相信市面上流行的什麽小說或詩歌作法這一類的東西，田爲這些東西多半都是騙錢的，卽使你讀了十本八本這類什麽作法的東西，至多也不過使你知道一些機械的造句鍊詞的方法，並不能增長你的藝術才能。我以爲對於你最必要的，是多讀那些偉大作家的偉大作品，從莎土比亞，歌德，巴爾扎克，弗羅培爾，屠格湼夫，高爾基·········那兒去學習描寫的方法，融化他們的藝術的描寫法則成爲自己的描寫法則，以從事於文學的創作。這様，在不斷地努力寫作中，你的藝術的才能自然就會一天一天地增加起來了。</p>
<p>其次，說到寫作，當然必要有寫作的題材。有人說，題材是不關緊要的，自然界的風景，富翁的豪華，窮人的苦痛，少女的憂愁，······都可以做題材，成問題　祇在於站在什麽觀點上來表現，卽怎様表現。其實這祇是看到了創作態度之重要這一方面的說法；忽視了題材的積極性。因爲文學作品是由藝術地</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>反映社會生活來結合人類的思想與感情的，作家所描寫的事物，如果與多數社會人的生活有很密切很明顯的關係。那其在思想和情感上，對於人類的結合力必然很大；反之，如果作家所描寫的是與我們的生活無直接明顯的關係的事物，則其感人的力就很少的了。譬如，在目前的中國，與一般國民生活的關係最大的，是帝國主義的侵略問題，是天災，是工商業凋敝、農村經濟破產的事情，如果你不在這些中間去找題材，甚至不去找那與這些現象有最大關係的題材，而去描寫自然風景或那罕有的特殊的社會現象，那麽，卽使你有絕大的藝術才能，也不能寫出適合於客觀世界需要的有偉大價値的文學作品。所以，在採取題材上，你必須憑你的生活經騐，憑你的感覺和觀察，以那與我們的生活有最大關係的事物，以那主要的社會現象，以那典型的社會生活及其傾向爲題材，來努力你的創作。</p>
<p>同時、你對於事物的認誠，你創作時所站的立塲，更是特别重要。我們知道，在同一題材之下，如果要兩個觀點不同的作家來創作，則其所表現的社會思想與感情必然是兩様的，因而其價値也是兩様的。譬如，以「一二八」日本進攻中國的事件爲題材，若要一個具有奸商意識的作家和一個爲中華民族的獨立而奮鬥的作家來寫作，則其所寫成的作品的内容及其價値就大有區别了。同時，文學是喜歡眞實的，文學作品的價値主要地是以其表現的思想之是否眞實和眞實到什麽程度來决定。佐治說：「虚僞不正確的思想横於藝術作品之根底時，則思想在作品中引起内面的矛盾，因此作品的美學價値必要受害。」但是，怎様才不會把「虚僞不正確的思想横於作品」中呢？怎様才能表現出眞實來呢？這就要以你的意識形態，你的世界觀，你的立塲來决定了。</p>
<p>自然，在描寫的時候，你可以從故事的起首處寫起，一直寫下去；也可以從故事的終結地方寫到起首和中間來；更可以從中間開始回顧到起頭再展開到以後：這些都可隨你的便，看是怎様描寫才適合於你所要表現的故事和思想，你就那様地描寫下去。但是，有一點你須得注决，卽是你不要平板的叙述，抽象的說敎，你必須具體地生動地描寫牠。對於人物的情感的表現，對於事物的發展情形，都要把握其具體的動態來描寫，不當在平靜的法則下去作抽象的說敎。在居友的「從社會的見地來看藝術」中，有這様的幾句話：</p>
<p>「汝之口調，較汝之聲音爲美，</p>
<p>汝之笑，較汝之唇更可愛，</p>
<p>汝之眼光，優於汝之眼睛，</p>
<p>其光輝，火無如此之光燄。」</p>
<p>這是爲什麽呢？因爲動的姿態比靜的形狀更能刺激人的感觀，更能引人注意。在藝術的表現上，生動的描寫比較平靜的述說是有着更大的藝術的感人力量的。</p>
<p>最後，所謂藝術的才能，所謂題材的選擇，所謂立塲，所謂描寫法則，都是與你的生活有密切關係的。所以，你必要認眞生活，必要有豐富的生活經騐，來寫作文學作品。有時候，就是各種社會生活的實際地考察和體騐，對於你也是必要的。　　托以夫斯基責備屠格湼夫說：「你　　　僅僅從新聞紙上知道生活」，當然　　是說應該實際地去考察生活；左拉在寫作之前必要去訪問他所要描畫的人物，考察他所要表現的生活；······這様實際地去考察和體騐生活，有時確是非常必要的。因爲有些社會生活，非去實際體騐就不能理解，自然也就不能描寫了。所以，爲了創作，你除去認眞地在你生活的環境中生活外，更當到一般人羣中去，使你的生活經騐和知識更加豐富起來。</p>

<p>— 士英</p>
<p>在這戲劇空氣沉寂的年頭，「水銀燈下」和「回春之曲」兩劇的上演，可算是一件値得注意的事情。我們除了佩服上海舞臺恊會諸君對劇藝的毅力和熱心以外，對於這兩個劇本的内容和演出，也很想說幾句話：</p>
<p>㈠「水銀燈下」</p>
<p>「水銀燈下」是取材於電影界的現實生活的一個劇本。這裏不單是表現了電影從業員們在影片攝製過程中的不同的任務，也刻劃了他們基於地位不同而形成的獨特的感受與個性。這裏甚至是特别着力在這後一點，把上級電影從業員，如經理，導演，劇務，佈景師，攝影師，收音師，大明星······等從業生活的不堪間，和生活的墮落，知識學力的淺陋······凡是「黒暗圈」裏的種種形色，這裏都有着生動的帶點諷刺的客觀記述。一些下級從業員們，特别是臨時演員們的困苦的遭遇，及其與生活搏鬥的勇氣，這裏也有着很生動的素描。</p>
<p>這個戲的情節很简單，祗不過是記述一段水銀燈下的眞實形象和一個臨時演員的奇遇與愛國熱誠罷了。臨時演員的困苦辛勞，女臨時演員受上級人員的欺侮玩弄，這裏是穿挿了進去的，是這裏採用的重要題材；但尤重要的郤是臨時演員Ｃ丨丨一個從東北抗敵失敗復回上海，因失業才以作臨時演員糊口的人丨丨和他的當了女明星的妻子的偶遇，以及他的抗敵的熱誠。他斥駡了他那出賣靈魂的妻子。他不聽導演的指揮，在拍退郤的塲面，他郤以前進來代替了。東北英勇的民族戰爭在他的記憶裏搖幌着，喚起了他的激越的前進的情緒。在這健忘的年代裏，這様的題材，無疑是可以喚取我們沉痛的回憶的吧。</p>
<p>這個戲的編製技術大體上還不錯，不過小毛病郤也不是沒有的。爲了篇幅，我現在不想說牠的結構如何嚴密，性格如何鮮明，對白如何諧趣······我祇想把牠的一點小疵檢討一番。我認爲臨時演員Ｃ和其妻的偶遇，有點「無巧不成戲」。縱說這種事頗有可能，但劇作者事先似乎沒有好好的Ｅxpose一番，有難於使人深信之感。</p>
<p>演員的表演，因爲登臺的都是有經騐的人，成績當然不會使人失望。要說到個人的成績，則萬籟天的導演，鄭君里胡萍的男女明星，袁牧之的臨時演員Ｃ，都是頗値得一提的。</p>
<p>㈡「回春之曲」</p>
<p>回春之曲是一個很動人情感的戲。這裏有悲壯激烈的塲面　有典型　格的描寫，有慷慨沉痛的悲歌。有一種激越的熱誠，沉着的勇敢，犧牲的决心，把這「回春之曲」給罩上了一重壯烈而又沉重的霧。</p>
<p>劇情並不怎様複雜，祗不過描寫着三個從南洋跑回祖國來投効義勇軍的青年敎育員的英勇的經歷及其不幸的遭遇。第一幕寫他們在南洋的生活和他們對東北淪陷的憤慨。男女主人翁的特性和他們私情的深厚在第一幕裏也有着很好的說明。一種重厚的友情，也假着兩個配角，挿寫進去了。南洋華僑創業的艱難及其目前所受當地政府的苛待，以及南洋的經濟危機等，在各演員的口中也都扼要的說出來了。在第二幕裏，男主人翁維漢和他的好友思訓碧如，是東北沒有去成，郤在上海「一二八」戰爭中達到了他們投効祖國的志願。舞臺上佈的是華僑主辦的傷兵醫院的景。在這裏我們看到一些可敬的傷兵的呻吟，可感激的醫生們的診治和小姐們的看護，以及民衆們可敬佩的偉大的抗敵熱情。一切都是「一二八」的當時後方民衆的抗敵熱情的壯烈的複演。在第三幕裏，維漢是受傷成了痴子了；可是因爲這新年的爆竹聲，郤喚起了他對於衝鋒時的悲壯的回憶，他便在這回憶裏恢復了他神經的健康。</p>
<p>全劇梗槪大致如此。這個戲的不可及處是題材眞實，尤其是牠和目前我們民族的危機及其前途的光明處聯繫得恰好。雖然編撰技術上仍難免有些偶然巧合　　點，但大體上這個戲是可以一看的了。</p>
<p>演員幾乎是ＡllＳtarＣast，由於長期的訓練和主持人優良的指導，其表演的成績大體上可以說是不錯。演員個人成績以王人美，王瑩，趙丹，梅　，金燄，魏鶴林等爲優。</p>

<h3 id="c302">故鄕的廢曆年夜 <a href="#c302" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e302" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">302</a></h3>
<p>— 家瑀</p>
<p>「冬至」過後的日子便一天天的長了；我坐的這隻船靠了九江碼頭，太陽還那麽鮮紅的高高地掛在天角上，倒映在江水裏起着五色的霞光，像魚鱗般的閃着。</p>
<p>船到的這天，恰巧是廢曆除夕的早上，船裏裝滿了像我一様的回家過年（？）的客人；在每個人的臉上，能够看到的都是從内心裏透露出來的歡忻，船裏是充滿了愉快的空氣了。</p>
<p>當這船駛近「躉船」還有丈把遠近的距離，站在「躉船」那一面的挑夫，似乎有點兒飢不擇食了。他們便一個個地像老鷹撲食般地朝這船上躍了過來；身體運用得像箭般地迅快，還不等你一霎眼就飛也似的過來了。</p>
<p>我看着那種爲了生活的競爭，眞有點兒害怕。天呀！一丈多遠的距離，要是一個不小心滑了脚，還會有命嗎？我想。</p>
<p>他們究竟是因了吃飯的問題，比什麽問題都要嚴重，所以我心裏所想的，也許在他們的意識裏，根本就沒有那種存在。因此不等船靠好「躉船」，他們都已經跳了上來，有的甚至連主顧也找好了。</p>
<p>我坐的是後面的房艙，挑夫們還沒有走到這裏；茶房替我把行李捆好放在牀舖上面，呌我就在旁門口等着。</p>
<p>他說；「客人，你不要走開，這個碼顯比别個馬頭壞，霎眼不見，東西就給丢了。」</p>
<p>「謝謝你，我曉得！」我望他笑了一笑。</p>
<p>這時從前艙湧進來三四個挑夫，每一個人手裏都握着一條半邊竹子做成的槓棒，上面掛着兩個像銅鑼般大小的麻繩紥成的「落盤」，這就是他們吃飯的全副「生財」了。</p>
<p>「先生！你老人家上城吧？我帮你挑去，便宜點兒！」一個挑夫很熟悉似的走進我這房裏，伸手把舖蓋提了一提。</p>
<p>「擺好！講好價錢再搬！」我瞪着眼向他望了一下。</p>
<p>他突然地感到一種驚愕，身子微微地一顫，往後倒退了兩步，臉上立刻浮上失望的神情；他萬想不到我會是九江人！</p>
<p>「先生！好說，好說；本鄕本土的人，我還會多要麽？」他勉强的涎着臉又這麽說。</p>
<p>「不行，還是先說定的好。幾多錢，挑到城裏？「我裝出一副老出門的様子。</p>
<p>「先生，本鄕本土的人，不說「虚頭」算五角錢丨」他說着把一隻粗壯的手朝上一伸，顯着很堅决的神氣。</p>
<p>「五角錢？我向他身」後的幾個挑夫瞥了一眼；心想他這幾個人當中，總有個把會自動跌價的。</p>
<p>「五角錢，眞莫討你老人家的虚頭！」他還不等别個挑夫開口，又連忙搶着說。</p>
<p>「莫討虚頭，瞎說？我從前呌别人挑的，頂多一角錢，你說五角，嘿！」</p>
<p>「一角錢，將是挑不到了！先生，你不曉得現在挑東西的難處，就是像這五角錢挑一担東西還是不够吃飯的；你老人家是混大錢的，眞不曉得我們的苦處啊！你先生要挑去，老老實實算四角錢罷丨」站在那後面的一個年紀很大的挑夫，接着分辯似的嘮叨了一會。</p>
<p>我聽得有點不耐煩了，連忙截住他的話頭說：「好罷，就是三角錢，多一個銅板我都不要你們挑了！」</p>
<p>他們幾個互相望了一眼，大家都默不作聲地把視綫集中到我身上朝我看着。</p>
<p>「怎麽様？快說？」我跟着催上一句。</p>
<p>「你帮他老人家挑去吧？」那個年老的帶着失望的眼光，望那先頭的挑夫說。</p>
<p>這是離開故鄕五年的第一次回家「過年」，鋪蓋和箱子也還是出門時那麽様的兩件，不過現在更加敞舊了；那兩件東西擱在挑夫的肩上，輕飄得像兩捆破棉絮似的，走起來東衝西撞的搖着。</p>
<p>「三角錢，挑到城裏，眞够便宜。」我走到甲板上了，還聽到那個老挑夫這麽地說着。</p>
<p>我和挑夫從碼頭走到「正街」，這一條五年不見面的故鄕的街道，牠是隨着無情的光陰愈老了！</p>
<p>兩邊的商店，雖然有的也會和上海商店一様裝着無綫電機，作爲吸引顧客的工具，可是眞能進去買東西的人，却是少到可以數得清的。這在五年以前的廢歷除夕，絕對是沒有過這様冷落的景象！</p>
<p>我到家時，客堂中間已經連着放好了兩張桌子，上面齊齊整整的擺滿了「三牲」；桌子面前放着一架大火盆，正在燒着通紅的炭火，畢剝畢剝的爆炭聲音，有如放爆竹般的響着，這大槪是快預備「還福」的様子。</p>
<p>在這五年消失了我的影子的客堂裏面，這時突然我又在這裏出現了；無怪母親當時驚愕得半天說不出話來。她整個的心靈是給這意外的喜悅罩住了；她那蒼老的臉孔上鋪滿了歡笑的顏色，似乎眞是發了一筆大財般的，直把她喜得連上供的年飯也忘了預備。</p>
<p>家裏人們都是這麽地希望我回來，然而我有什麽帶來給她們一些安慰？五年的流浪生活，喪失了我固有的天眞質樸的性情，隔絕了我和家庭的情感。在這悠長的五年中，家庭的影子在我腦海裏是隨着久遠的日子一天天的消蝕，連一點薄膜般的印象也沒有了存在！可是，她們對我依舊像過去一様的親切，誠懇；甚至我這次回來，對她們過的這個新年也許更會增加不少的興味！</p>
<p>我看着桌子上的「還福」的祭品呆楞了一會，母親倒以爲我是在船上累了，有什麽不大舒服。她連忙伸手在我　頰上摸了一摸，躭心的問着我說：「駒兒！怎麽地，有那裏難過吧？𠳾？」</p>
<p>「沒有什麽！我看到今年桌上倒擺着「眞鷄」「還福」，我覺得奇怪的很呢！」我望着母親笑着說。</p>
<p>「哦！」母親以爲明白了我的意思，臉上又浮上一層歡慰的神情；接着便告訴我今年「還福」用「眞鷄」的原因，她說；「駒兒！你還不曉得，今年鷄的價錢和假鷄！蘿　！差不多，一塊錢要買上十來斤，還是大肥鷄婆呢！嘿！鄕下人平常拿着鷄在手裏，喊一塊錢賣十二斤也沒有人要；這幾天是快到新年了，　才賣一塊錢十斤。我幸虧買的早，不然又得吃虧點兒！」母親說着嘆了口氣。</p>
<p>「一塊錢十斤的鷄？那简直可以把鷄當飯吃！」我眞有點不敢相信母親的話是一定可靠。</p>
<p>「當飯吃，也辦不到的；鄕下要的還是米呀！」母親反駁了我一句。</p>
<p>今年「還福」是應該我燒香磕頭的，雖然我滿心的不願意，但是也沒有方法可以推脫。一會兒，所有燒好的吃年夜飯的菜肴統統搬了出來，桌子上給擺滿得連放酒盅的地方都沒有了；後來有幾碗實在擺不下，我才呌她們拿回去，可是母親還有點不大願意，她似乎抱怨我五年沒有在家裏「還福」的時候燒香磕頭，這回還是這麽不誠心？</p>
<p>這晚上的年夜飯，大家吃得都非常的高興；母親更是不用說得的，因爲我今年也會在家裏過年，她本來是不大會吃酒，今晚却例外吃了兩杯，後來還是姊姊怕她吃醉了，才沒替她再斟。</p>
<p>「駒兒！你明年如果再回來過年，母親不曉得要怎様的歡喜呢！」姊姊看着滿臉堆下笑的母親，承歡地說着。</p>
<p>「唔！」我祗輕微地笑了一笑；我自己實在不敢把握自己說明年一定能够回來，所以我祗好囫圇的答應了一聲。</p>
<p>母親却是懷着很大的希望，她用着命令式的口吻說：「明年自然也要回來過年的，那裏有個一出門就幾年不回來，連家裏也忘了？俗話說；「樹高千丈，葉落歸根。」你平常不回來，過年總應當回來的啊！「有錢無錢，回家過年。」你看前頭大房的三叔，他在北平那麽遠的地方，也還要趕回來過年呢！」</p>
<p>「有錢無錢，回家過年。」母親說這話的意思，我是懂得的，她是怕我沒有錢不好意思回來，所以才這様的鼓勵我沒有錢家總是要的。可是，我的意識恰恰和她相反的；我覺得沒有錢就不必過年，有錢天天都是在過年。明年我的生活前途，將會有什麽變化，我自己這時也還不曉得，所以明年能不能回去過年，也就不敢把握！</p>

<p>歡他那自成一家的蘭竹畫和字體。雖然他中年以後不過是一個普通的官僚，失去了壯年時代新鮮的氣質，但他到底是一個能文章敦品行的人，他的讀書治學和做人的嘉言，到底是値得我們拿來借鏡的。暇中讀了不少他的家書，今摘錄其中若干嘉言於後，以供我們賢明的讀者作參考：</p>
<p>讀書宜勤懇勿懈，看書宜細心有恒。</p>
<p>有緊要處，摘錄讀書日記簿；有費解處，另紙摘出，求解於先生。</p>
<p>閱書時見有切於實用之句，宜隨手摘錄；若能分門别類，積成巨册，則作文時，可作材料，利益無窮也。</p>
<p>爲政不在多言，爲學亦然。</p>
<p>凡人讀書，原拏不定發達，然卽不發達，要不可以不讀書，立意便拏定也。科名不來，學問在我，原不是折本的買賣。</p>
<p>文章以沉著痛快爲最，左，史，莊，騒，杜詩，韓文是也。</p>
<p>讀書以過目成誦爲能，最是不濟事。眼中了了，心下怱怱，方寸無多，往來應接不暇，如看塲中美色，一眼卽過，與我何與也。</p>
<p>與其濫交招損，寗使孤陋寡聞。</p>
<p>以人爲可愛，而我亦可愛矣；以人爲可惡，而我亦可惡矣。</p>
<p>凡人於文章學問，輒謂自己長，科名唾手而得，不知俱是徼倖。</p>
<p>平生最不喜籠中養鳥。我圖娱悅，彼在囚牢；何情何理，而必屈物之性以適吾性乎？</p>
<p>夫君子學道則愛人，爲政持大體，不尙矯枉過正。</p>
<p>養生之道有五：㈠黎明卽起，吃白粥一碗，不用粥菜；㈡飯後散步，以千步爲率；㈢默坐有定時，每日於散學後靜坐片刻；㈣遇事勿惱怒；㈤睡後勿思想。</p>

<h3 id="c307">讀「新生」一卷四十八九兩期 <a href="#c307" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e307" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">307</a></h3>
<p>— 吉崇</p>
<p>丨新生周刋社發行，定價每册四分丨</p>
<p>「新生」是目前中國一般進步的中小職員及青年學生所最喜歡的小刋物，據說她已有了五六萬的讀者，這在一般書業不景氣的情况之下，在「雜誌競賽」的年頭兒裏，當然是很「特别」的。但此種特别情形並不是「新生」發行者的「特殊的」發行方法所造成，而是由於她的良好的内容所使然的。我是「新生」的經常讀者，現在特將我讀一卷四十八及四十九兩期的「新生」後的感覺，約略地寫在下面，俾讀者諸君得知道這刋物的一個大槪。</p>
<p>說謊使人討厭，眞實是可愛的。「新生」所講的都是實話，所以她能得到廣大的讀者的愛護。她是勇敢地去接近現實，以公平的科學的眼光去觀察，鮮明地把其眞實姿態揭露了出來。如四十八期上畢雲程君的「美國財富的分配」，便眞實地表現了我們的鍍金博士們所神往的金元王國之極端不平的本體；又如四十九期上易水君的「甘地主義的沒落」，行素君的「看報有感」，都是眞實地把甘地主義在印度的沒落情形，把紳士老爺們的面目，一齊告訴了我們。丨丨大膽地說「老實話」，這是「新生」的第一特點。</p>
<p>第二，「新生」不鑽中國的舊的字紙簍，也不搬運外國的古董，她所談的都是現實的與我們的生活有密切關係的問題。如四十八期上坎如君的「東施效顰」，方殷君的「與和平開玩笑的人」，玉珍君的「女性的最大敵人是什麽？」以及葛喬君的「内憂潛伏的第三帝國」（四十八期）與「波羅的海的暗礁丨米美爾」（四十九期），都是談論着現實的中國或世界的問題的。在這當中，「東施效顰」是表現了我們的民族敵人一切帝國主義者之惡劣；「與和平開玩笑的人」是說出了戰神的奴才們韓德森（軍縮會議的主席），白里安（已去世的法國外長），奥斯汀張伯爵士（英國維克斯軍火廠的大股東）等，都得到了諾貝爾和平獎金；「女性的最大敵人是什麽？」，是警告而且諷刺了那些祇注意形式的言行不一的」新女性」，作者在最後曾作了這様一個有力的警告：「路是長的，牠不需要空談而需要切切實實的走上去。如果天生成的大脚也要裝模作様，好像瘟臭的三寸金蓮似的，便是那最可恥的奴性的表現，這奴性便是女性的最大敵人。」；「内憂潛伏的第三帝國」與「波羅的海的暗礁丨丨米美爾」則是科學地分析了與目前世界危機有很大關係的兩個國際問題。</p>
<p>第三，除了刋載與我們的生活有密切關係的言論外，「新生」還刋載些描寫各種職業生活及各地方的情况的東西。四十八期上程和秋君的「再望世界大戰的鐵行」，陸新球君的「從江南到青島」，以及四十九期上蔚川君的「電燈公司的練習生」：等文，不僅是眞實的生活素描的文字，而且是文學作家的良好題材，是研究社會問題的良好材料。</p>
<p>第四，「新生」不僅眞實地表現現實，說明生活，而且還正當地告訴我們應該怎様生活，鼓勵我們前進。譬如四十九期上畢雲程君就告訴我們：「抱着頽廢心理所表現出來的做人態度是最要不得的做人態度」；「不滿於現實而要求進步」，「但所採取的方法是呌囂凌亂徒逞意氣」，「這様抱着浮躁心理所表現出來的做人態度」，「也是不足取的」；「不滿現狀，觀察力求深入，要把社會病態的根本原因弄個明白」，「目標力求正確，要把人類社會生存進化的根本原理弄個明白」，「這様抱着沉着奮鬥的心理所表現出來的做人態度」，「才是「値得一般人做榜様的」！丨丨這的確是正當的做人態度，正當的生活方法。</p>
<p>第五，「新生」的立塲雖是科學的立塲，但其用以表現意見的文字却是非常通俗而有趣味的。在這裏，沒有什麽「開摧」，「扭現」······等生硬的「新生彙」，也沒有顚顚倒倒的歐化詞句，所有的都是很通俗的活潑大方的文章。其中一般隨筆，速寫，生活素描的文字當然是通俗美好的，卽是硬性的政治經濟的文章，也極其生動活潑。譬如，四十九期上莫夫君的「一年來的中國經濟巡禮」，雖是「硬性」的經濟論文，但我們看起來却能發生很大的興趣。作者沒有用乾燥無味的統計表來說明過去一年的中國經濟，而是用農民的苦痛，工人的生活，銀行商店的情形和必要的數目字來說明的，所以使人讀起來覺得其中所說與自己的生活都有着重大的關係，與閱讀那些專門用統計表來嚇人的經濟論文時的情形全不相同。</p>
<p>第六，對於一般讀者，「新生」是很負責的。舉凡她的讀者所向她提出的問題，她都能耐心地精細地給以正當的解釋。我以爲「新生」的「讀者通信欄」比國内各種小刋物的都好：這恐怕也是她能抓住讀者的主要原因之一吧。</p>
<p>最後，我們除向大家介紹「新生」外，尙望今後「新生」更加充實起來。依我個人的意見，「新生」還缺乏關於各種學術的理論與研究社會問題的方法的文字，而這類東西　景目前中國一般青年所急需的，爲廣大的讀者所愛護的「新生」似乎應該滿足他們這種需要。</p>

<h3 id="c309">愛因斯坦傳（三） <a href="#c309" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e309" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">309</a></h3>
<p>— 從木</p>
<p>一九○三年之初，愛因斯坦與其以前在基里契同窗的密娃·瑪麗克結婚了。這時，他所親近的友人有伯茲梭，莫里斯·梭羅芬，和青年數學家昆拉茲特·哈比希德。這些朋友常常在他家裏與他通夜地談論着科學和哲學的問題，有時高興起來，大家都高聲談論，但這様一來，却妨碍了别人的睡眼，以致常常和他發生糾紛。</p>
<p>一九○四年，他的夫人生了一個男孩子，其名字仍附以亞爾巴特。從這學起，愛因斯坦在其一生中學術的最多產的時代開始了。</p>
<p>這時，愛因斯坦除在特許局服務的時間外，其餘的都分用在家庭事務和學問方面。這可說是他的深刻研究的開始。</p>
<p>他的論文，最初載於「特理年鑑」（繼續了百年以上的德國的代表的學術雜誌之一）的，是一九○一年這雜誌所載的「關於毛管現象古」的論文。其後，在一九○二，三，四年中這雜誌共載了他四篇文章，都是關於熱力學，分子論，新的統計力學的。</p>
<p>一九○五年揭載於「物理年鑑」的他的四篇論文，皆有不朽的價値，在構成物理學的三個不同的方面上，可以說這些都是劃時期的研究。從此愛因斯坦在學術上的地位便確定了，但要爲一般人所認識，却還需的時間。</p>
<p>在這四篇論文中，最初發表的，是三月十七日所刋載的「關於光的發生及變换的一個嘗試的觀點」的論文，這是在所謂光量子說的根源上，把蒲蘭克於一九○○年在熱輻射論上導出的量子假說，開始在熱輻射以外，發光現象等之上擴張了，同時又是記載在後年見於廣汛實用的光電氣現象之基礎關係，所謂愛因斯坦方程式的。</p>
<p>五月十一日所載的「關於浮游在靜止的流體中的粒子是作爲熱的分子運動的理論之結果而產生的運動」的論文，乃是依據他數年來的熱力學的分子論的研究，論究所謂布拉文運動的。</p>
<p>到此時爲止，愛因斯坦所發表的論文，都是關於熱力學及分子論的，所謂「光的發生及變換」的論文，也是以熱力學的分子論的考察爲基礎，但一九○五年六月所發表的「關於動體的電氣力學」的論文，便全不相同了，這是關於物理學的其他領域的。十年以後，他卽發表了他那有名的一般相對論的前驅的卽現在所謂的特殊相對論的論文。至於揭載於一九○五年的「物理年鑑」上的他的名爲「物體的情性關係於其能力的内容嗎？」的第四篇文，則是應該繼着上述的第三篇論文來看的。</p>
<p>在一九○五年，他還向基里契大學的亞爾夫萊德。克萊那敎授提出論文而得到了博士學位。這論文便是揭載於一九○六年的「物理年鑑」上的「分子之大的新測定法的」。</p>
<p>因爲愛因斯坦得到了博士學位，克萊那敎授便覺得有請這位優秀的青年學者到基里契大學去的必要。但他去不能一開始就作大學敎授，必須作一個時間的講師，而講師的收入又不能維持一家人的生活，所以當時他很爲難；幸而伯倫也有大學，於是他卽停留在伯倫，仍然保持其在特許局的位置，同時又在伯倫的大學任講師。</p>
<p>當時聽愛因斯坦講的，正式登記者紙有兩個人。其一是上述的伯茲梭，另外一個則是電信局的青年技師夏般，這兩個都是原來有能力的。但愛因期坦之初次出馬，竟遇到了這様的事情，却也是不得不令人歎息的。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c314">桃樂絲德里奥快樂家庭的方式 <a href="#c314" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e314" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">314</a></h3>
<p>— 西林</p>
<p>桃樂絲德里奥（ＤoioreＤefＲio）個人方面的聰明智慧，寗靜勇敢，以及她家庭方面的生活圓滿，已經成了好萊塢交相讚譽的佳談。許多好萊塢明星們當中的少婦少女們，遇到了家庭發生變故，夫婦不和的時候，都要請敎到這位桃樂絲德里奥。所以桃樂絲德里奥，對於這快樂家庭方式的問題，是很有資格講幾句的。</p>
<p>她年紀雖然不大，但她是腦筋豐富，觀察透澈的人，無論在成功的時候，或是在失敗的時候。她的致力於快樂家庭的建設，亦就是她有思想，有腦筋的地方。她說：「很简單地說來，當你計劃一件事的事候，無論那事是重要的或是瑣碎的，你總要想到失敗的可能性，而預備一個其次的計劃，來維持你的地位，來安慰你，鼓勵你，在你第一個計劃失敗之後。那就是你替你自己留的後步。無論何人，無論何事，後步是不能沒有的。</p>
<p>現在就拿一件極小的事情來說。譬如你一天晚上，計劃着要出去吃晚飯，晚飯後看影戲。忽然你的朋友，或是你的丈夫回來了，顯然的因爲疲倦了而不想出去。倘使你在計劃出去的時候，曾經留一個後步，預備出門出不成功的，那你的失望就自然减輕了許多，你亦不至於鬧脾氣了。</p>
<p>這種雖是小事，但是小亦可以喩大。更重要的事情，亦是如此的。即以我個人生活而論，我自從艱難困苦中，得到了許多敎訓之後，我亦替我終身的事業，計劃了兩條大路。一條是往右去的，一條是往左去的。倘使我在銀幕上的工作失敗了，我就從右面一條路上退了回來，轉向左面的一條路上去。那左面的一條路，就是回到我家庭生活的一條路。我在銀幕上，雖然有相當的地位，但是還談不到稱心滿意，所以我在左面那條路上，亦辛勤工作的準備着我的後路。我的家庭，我的園藝，我的爲人之道，我和我丈夫所苦同享受的生活，都時時在我考慮之中。銀幕生活、在已往是極優過我的，一旦使我失望了，我就退回來，回到家庭，亦不至於傷心失望了。</p>
<p>一個女明星，在他事業鼎盛的時候，能够想到將來的後步，顏失致力於家庭的佈置，以爲未雨綢繆之計，那種思想上的縝密，是値得我們欽佩的。</p>
<p>但是他的思想還有獨到之處，而是一般普通浪漫成性的女明星們所不可及的，就是他贊成女子得到了丈夫之後，而要能保持他的丈夫。他對於丈夫的保持，却不是像計劃一件事似的，預先留了一個後步，以備這個男子不合適，立即退下來換一個。他自己很客氣地說他，</p>
<p>是拉丁種族的人生長於老式家庭之中，雖然一方面羨慕摩登女子選擇丈夫，掉換丈夫的自由，但自己的腦筋，却未免陳舊些。不過，當失去一個丈夫的時候，雖然有掉換新丈夫的希望，但亦有其相當的痛苦，倒不如能保持而不失去的好。以下就是桃樂絲德里奥所指示的保持丈夫的方法：</p>
<p>桃樂絲說；一當然我不能說那一件事是最要緊，但是普通的說，一個已婚的人，須要記住婚姻的儀式，並不是一件事的告終，亦不是給你一個所有權，使你對於那件東西有當然的權利，而無庸憂慮其喪失的。反之，婚禮以前的種種，必須在婚後繼續下去。男子的所以得到」個女子，和女子的得到一個男子一様，怎様得到的，還要怎様去保持。求愛之道，必須於婚後繼續行之。温柔，體貼，諒解，羅曼斯，在婚後亦如在婚前，缺一即不可的。不可使羅曼斯在婚後死去。不要視夫婦間的關係，是一件當然而無庸加以考慮的事。</p>
<p>「更進一層說，夫婦間在旣婚之後，應當尋求更堅固的給合。女子方面，應以能治家爲榮，應將家庭生活當作一件可貴的，偉大的事業。再則家用，應以進欵爲範圍，萬萬不可　成　侈浪費的習慣。負債尤其是女子所不應該的事。購買東西，分期付欵的方法，是危險的負債的開始，會常常使你心緒不寗。所以，還是從頭設法避免的好。</p>
<p>「再則女子嫁了丈夫之後，有生育兒女的責任。以我個人而論，將來我有了生兒育女的準備的時候，我情願放棄了我的職業，專心致志於兒女的養育。一個小孩是値得任何母親的一心撫育的。有了子女，家庭才愈臻完備，夫婦間的關係，才愈見深切。此外，話又說回來了，處處要留一後步。温柔恭順是女子的本份，雖然你不必一定要依賴於男子。能够做到以上的諸點，丈夫就不至於輕輕夫掉了。</p>

<h3 id="c315">評「空谷蘭」丨新光映丨 <a href="#c315" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e315" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">315</a></h3>
<p>— 繼漢</p>
<p>當電影完全作爲敎育工具而使用的時候，電影作者决不是要迎合觀衆，而是緊抓住觀衆的需要，以提高他們的理解。但是當電影完全從生意眼上來估價的時候，電影作者所要做到的是降底水凖的凑合落後的人們之欲求。所以因着胡蝶還能够賈座，因着一般人愛着倫理影片，於是在「姊妹花」和「再生花」之後又來了這胡蝶一人兼飾三角的「空谷蘭」，而且這個陳舊的倫理片是曾經在默片時代哄動一時的。</p>
<p>不管在前面或後面，加上一點革命的史實和光明的大道，這裏所表現着的人物和故事，始終是離奇曲折，不近情理的。我就不懂得高占非所飾的人物何以會參加北伐？又何以會北伐以後便一無所事的貴族化生活下去？也不懂得胡蝶所飾的角色何以能和父親生活下去？·····一切都是不近情理的凑合，不近情理的偶然。然而就因爲這些都是所謂戲劇情的，再加上兩部火車開玩笑似的互撞，於是良彥的母親便以李幽蘭夫人而出現，所謂後母娘虐待前妻之子，親娘看見兒子活受罪，硬凑起來的所謂倫理關係便和「姊妹花」等一様沒來由的博觀衆們的眼淚了。</p>
<p>說到「空谷蘭」的編劇導演的手法，也是不見高明，那末長的故事，又是那末嚕囌的表現出來。它沒有戲的故事，它是嚕囌的叙述，有戲可做的地方又是那様不嫌其長，不能緊凑一點以顯電影戲劇的藝術的效能。舉例說：沈駿那個孩子在母親遺容前哭喚媽媽的一塲，拉得那末長的，一點兒悲劇的情感，都給消滅了。再加胡蝶追嚴月嫻的一塲，直到搶藥瓶，現出本來面目爲止，也因爲太長了而失去緊張的空氣。</p>
<p>其他如高占非回家，當差的喊「少爺回來了」，也是過於冗長的。再加上雙彌月的挿曲以及幾次的歌唱，都因着生硬而變爲多餘了，何况歌曲的創作又是那末幼稚的。</p>
<p>就演員來說，高占非的鬍鬚和王獻齋的一様假得可笑。不過從他旣不知嚴月嫻會自殺爲什麽要跑得那末快，便證明大半是導演累了他的。胡蝶仍是老様兒，不見進步。較好的還是嚴月嫻頗爲生動。此外，如對白的生硬，說白時一字一句的沒有情感，以及佈景之假而浪費，也不必一一指出了。</p>
<h3 id="c316">評「恭禧發財」 <a href="#c316" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e316" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">316</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>ＫidＭlllions丨大上海映</p>
<p>自然，我們不能說一個演員也有他自己的作風，不過有些演員却有許多導演，或編劇者爲了他而製作影片的。愛地康德從來就是一貫的主演完全空想，百在形式上是熱鬧胡調的影片，如「萬花獻媚」，如「羅宮綺夢」，都是如此，一直到現在的「恭禧發財」。</p>
<p>我們不能說「恭禧發財」沒有内容的，它的内容是窮小子偶然的發財，胡調，使人們在現實中逃避到幻想的夢境中去。這種作用不是偶然的，在後面開冰淇淋店，敎窮小子去吃得肚皮飽飽的。　　　　當然，這種地方正是可以使大批爲娱樂而娱樂的人們前去享樂的。在新年之中，在恭禧發財的笑聲中，不少人們是因此哈哈大笑的。我們對於這一影片的估價，除了說明其生意經的作用以外，乃是沒有方法找出它電影藝術的價値。至於要研究它的導演或其他技術方面，我們也是沒有什麽可說的，事實上無論那一方面都說明它的平庸，沒有任何特色。</p>
<h3 id="c317">「新女性」我評 <a href="#c317" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e317" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">317</a></h3>
<p>— 征雁</p>
<p>「新女性」這一影片，我們不能不說它是現實的，而且是在水平綫以上的作品。</p>
<p>劇作者在本片内創造了三個不同的女姓，代表現社會底三種不同的女性典型：一種是沉浸在奢侈淫靡的惡習中，而無健全的思想和知識。一種是雖具有新的思想，而實際上却又是缺乏理智底判斷力，致使環境處處阻礙了她該走的路，而使她無法自㧞。一種是旣具有健美的體格，復有堅决底意志，判斷力，而能决心實行「幹」的。</p>
<p>這三種不同形式上底三個女性之中，當然阿英是「新女性」中底現社會的新女性典型了。這也就是我們所不能否認爲作者的一種前進思想，和一番煞費苦心的啟示。</p>
<p>但是在内容底結構方面、有很多的地方我以爲尙須討論的：例如阿英旣是本片中的新女性，何以這裏却反是把她輕描淡寫一下，同時：阿英的勇敢刻苦，當然也應有她底一種困難的情形，而這裏亦是忽略了的。又如韋明當服毒以後，市民報刋載她死的消息，書局經理替她開追悼會，而她則送進醫院裏，醫生還能將她的毒消清······這些顯然是與事實不符的。其他的漏洞還有，但不一一指出了。</p>
<p>導演蔡楚生是比較「漁光曲」退步的了。演員方面，阮玲玉的表情很動人，陳素娟的表演亦很有天才。</p>

<p>— 柳村</p>
<p>自從大衛揮淚送别了密考伯家屬之後，他就籌劃着逃走的方法。他忽然想起了他的母親和壁各德，曾經講過他有一個怪僻的老姑母，呌貝測赤老脫烏的。那個姑母在他呱呱墮地的狂風暴雨之夜，曾到過他家。他記得她住在度佛西，並具照他所聽見的她是一個脾氣很古怪的老太太，但是無論如何，她總是他的血屬之親，不至於比别人待他更酷虐到什麽地方。</p>
<p>他計劃定了，一個小小年紀的童子，就遠足長行起來，路程中所經所歷，都是他畢生不會忘記的。他受了盜刦，遇見了强暴，被打了一頓，晚上沒有床睡覺，白天沒有東西吃。最後，經遇了千辛萬苦，來到了度佛西。在旣飢且倦之後，他一顚一躓地來到貝測姑母的家裏。他的姑母詫異地聽著他陳述他的短促而悲苦的生活。她靜靜聽完了，就覺得惻然心動起來。她和密司脫狄克，亦是一個古怪的遠親，就開始替大衛計劃着他的前途。</p>
<p>在此後的短促時期之中，大衛又開始覺得些樂趣。他的姑母，貎雖嚴峻可畏，但心實誠意。她有一個怪癖，就是最恨驢子。有胆敢趕着驢子，走到她門口草地上的她必定要漫駡　逐的。所以一班趕驢子的兒童，都怕她的。但是她非但嚇走一班趕驢子的兒童，她亦嚇走了密司脫和密司麥得斯東。他們聽見了大衛在度佛而，就續來將他帶走，但是遇見了這强項的老太太，受了一頓折辱去了。</p>
<p>從此之後，大衛就永遠脫離了他季父的覊摩，並且由他姑母的設法，他就被送到坎𢖼白雷一位威克菲而的家裏。他是他姑母的朋友和律師。在威克菲而的家裏，他非但得到一個平靜，可愛，快樂的住所，他並且温到了一個和他年事相若的女郎，和他一同玩耍。她是密司脫威克菲而的孩子。名字呌安尼司。她的母親死了，雖與老父相依爲命，但常覺得岑寂寡觀。因此大衛一到，就覺得一見如故起來。</p>
<p>但是在威克菲而家庭之中，亦不是毫無跌陷的。那裏有一個卑鄙小人，呌尤利亞喜迫的。他就是他們命中的惡魔，但是大衛起初却沒有深知，因爲他年齡太小了，沒有覺到威克菲而老先生的弱點。自從他的老妻去世之後，他就沉溺於葡萄酒之中。尤利亞是一個心術險詐的人。他外貎卑下，而實心懷不測。他一步一步地將威克菲而的事業，弄到他自己手理。尤利亞在名義上，是威克菲而的學生，跟他學習法律的，但是在事實上，他却趨過了學生的本份。</p>
<p>大衛雖不知尤利亞喜迫機詐之所在，但他一見他，就心裏發生了一種厭惡之心。他的手是柔軟而拳曲的。他的　貎，是恭順得過份的。他的面貎，使他在夢中都會心悸的。他的柔綿綿。濕滋滋的手，相像永遠是搭在他的肩膀上的。</p>
<p>一年一年的這様過去。大衛已送進了學校去研讀。他不久就變成了，一個風神俊逸的少年。他並且富有文才，頗思從事於著作。但他却缺少一個東西。他沒有審察的能力，他着不出安尼司的愛他。要是他早知道了，亦許安尼司就不至於爲他而憔悴了許多年。他現在已是一個成年的男子，世界已舒展在他的面前。他的目光，不久又轉注到了倫敦，他却放棄了在家庭中所能不求而獲的快樂。（未完）</p>

The Tianjin-Harbin radio transmission was not interrupted after the September 18th Incident. The method on both sides had been implemented for three years without problems. This time the establishment of wired communication will continue to use this example. However, international telegrams will not be relayed as they bear the foreign sub-marine cable costs. Offices within the Customs also reject telegrams with pseudonyms and place names from the fake organization. (Special Dispatch, 9th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Jiangning Local Court asked the Judicial Yuan for an interpretation regarding the question of whether the date of hospitalization for a drug addict should be deducted from the prison sentence. The interpretation is as follows: "The period of being transferred to a hospital for detoxification is still counted within the term of imprisonment, referring to those who are serving imprisonment. The situation of prisoners being sent out for medical treatment due to illness is naturally different. If they are sent to the hospital for detoxification before the imprisonment, then they have not been imprisoned at all, and there is no question of deducting the prison sentence." (Special Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Longzhou Local Court asked the Judicial Yuan for an interpretation of marriage relationship doubts. The interpretation is as follows: "A marriage relationship is validly established after marriage in accordance with the statutory method. Only entering into a marriage contract, but not getting married in accordance with the statutory method, and one party to the marriage contract enters into a marriage contract with another person and gets married, then the latter marriage is bigamy. Before the parties to the marriage relationship request to cancel the marriage or before the marriage, the marriage relationship still exists, and the parties to the established marriage relationship have obtained the status of a spouse (husband or wife) in law." Instructions are given to inform. (Special Dispatch, 9th)</p>

<h3 id="e47">On the Soviet Russian Constitutional Reform <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>According to a European dispatch yesterday, the Soviet Congress has passed the government's proposed constitutional amendments. The main points of this proposal are threefold: 1. Changing from roll-call voting to secret ballot voting; 2. Changing from indirect elections to direct elections; 3. Equalizing the electoral rights of farmers and workers. Such reforms cannot be said to be anything less than a significant page in the constitutional history of Soviet Russia. Soviet Russia is a world-renowned autocratic nation, and it can resolutely carry out such reforms, moreover, these reforms were completely without warning and were initiated by the rulers themselves. This is what surprises people, so the motivation and origins of this are especially worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Firstly, the drawbacks of roll-call voting have been discussed in detail by political scientists. The most important point is that voters' will is difficult to express freely because of concerns. Therefore, to put it bluntly, roll-call voting is not a good system. This reform in Soviet Russia can be said to be suitable for the present world. Secondly, indirect elections have always been a feature of the pyramid-shaped Soviet system and a key to the Soviet authorities' manipulation of elections and constraint of voters' will. Now that it can be changed to direct elections, the relationship between the Central Executive Committee and the voters will inevitably become closer. Thirdly, the Soviet Union's previous electoral system always valued workers and undervalued farmers, so the number of farmers' representatives in the Soviet Congress was far less than that of workers. This reform aims to bring farmers and workers to an equal position, which can be said to be a major step forward. Therefore, on the surface of this issue, the tendency of Soviet Russian politics towards democratization is obvious.</p>
<p>However, what we should study today is whether this political reform in Soviet Russia can affect its autocratic regime. From a factual point of view, the bourgeoisie no longer exists in Soviet Russia today, and all opposition party organizations have been eliminated. Even the Trotskyist and Bukharinist factions within the Communist Party have failed one after another. Because of the collective farms, farmers are industrialized and their status is no different from that of workers. Therefore, generally speaking, the Soviet Russia of today has in fact become a situation where the so-called proletariat exclusively dominates. To seek political reform in this situation, the beneficiaries are naturally the "proletariat" and not other classes. Therefore, although the current constitutional reform in Soviet Russia is a sign of democratization, in practice, it is purely democratization within the "proletariat" and cannot be compared with the democratic politics of Britain and the United States. Understanding this, one knows that the current constitutional reform in Soviet Russia is not only insufficient to shake its so-called "proletarian" dictatorship but is also sufficient to consolidate its position.</p>
<p>According to TASS news, the constitutional reform in Soviet Russia was initiated by Stalin. The reason for this bold action is a very meaningful question. From our observation, Stalin's motive seems to be to win domestic sympathy in order to prevent the resurgence of Trotskyist forces. Stalin is a politician who is good at using political strategies. The reason why he has his current position is that he is good at using other people's ideas. We can understand this by looking at the process of Stalin's power expansion. After Lenin's death, the Soviet Communist Party split into two factions: 1. The Trotskyist Left Wing; 2. The Bukharinist Right Wing. The former advocated ending the New Economic Policy in order to rapidly realize a communist society, while the latter advocated maintaining the status quo. At this time, the Trotskyist faction was very powerful, so Stalin allied with the Right Wing to overthrow Trotsky. After Trotsky was overthrown, Stalin used Trotsky's usual proposals to vigorously promote his Five-Year Plan, and the Right Wing realized that they had been deceived and plotted to overthrow Stalin. Stalin then used the method of overthrowing Trotsky to overthrow the Right Wing. As a result, the Five-Year Plan became Stalin's unique political achievement, and Stalin's prestige increased as a result. Recently, Stalin's right-hand man, Kirov, was assassinated. Soviet officials pointed to a Trotskyist conspiracy. Whether this is the case in reality is unknown, but it is also related to the remaining forces of the Trotskyist faction. In short, it is not easy for us to understand the changes between Soviet Russian parties, but from the facts, even the democratization of politics was advocated by Trotsky in the past. Therefore, it is not difficult to speculate on Stalin's intention in reforming the constitution this time, and it can be determined that this action in Soviet Russia not only does not hinder the dictatorship of the proletariat but will also increase Stalin's personal authority.</p>

Invite economic authorities from China and Japan to meet and study ways to overcome the current economic difficulties; 2. Maintain close contact with the Japanese chambers of commerce and industry in China; 3. Contact Chinese chambers of commerce and industry and entrepreneurs to investigate the state of agricultural panic, the impact of the anti-Japanese boycott on Chinese industry, the economic status of overseas Chinese, and the inflow of foreign capital into China, among other issues.

<p>Regarding the Seiyukai's Bomb Motion</p>
<p>The Government Does Not Hesitate to Fight to the End</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the aftermath of the bomb motion, the government has stated its policy of adding a second reserve fund. However, the government has adopted a tough stance and abandoned the compromise with the Seiyukai because the Seiyukai has persistently pursued the disciplinary issues of Tokuji Tokonami and others, which has harmed the intentions of the government's leading figures such as Takahashi Korekiyo, Minister of Finance. They have therefore accepted the tough opinions of the Minseito. If the Seiyukai acknowledges the establishment of the reserve fund, there will be no problems for the party. If they disagree, the government has stated that it will not hesitate to face a head-on collision. Therefore, the attitude of the Seiyukai is noteworthy. However, the government's observation is that even if the Seiyukai stops questioning the bomb motion due to the establishment of the reserve fund, they will attack issues such as the temporary excess profits tax and disciplinary problems. Therefore, since a tough stance has been adopted on the bomb motion, the attitude on other issues should not be changed either. If the Seiyukai launches an attack, they will not hesitate to fight to the end. Since the government has this awareness, the tense state of the political situation is difficult to resolve. (Dentsu dispatch of the 9th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the budget general meeting adjourned, the Seiyukai held a general affairs meeting. The government ignored the Seiyukai's demands and only attempted to muddle through by spending the second reserve fund. The hardliners within the party were very indignant, but the self-respecting faction also did not want to adopt a mediating attitude because their suggestions were not accepted by the government. The overall policy of the Seiyukai is to pass the government's budget bill first, and then challenge the government with issues such as disciplinary problems, the temporary excess profits tax, and the local finance allocation law. Therefore, conflict between the government and the Seiyukai is inevitable in the future. (Japan United Press dispatch of the 9th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Minseito believes that the cabinet decision made last night reflects the party's demands, especially the point of explicitly convening an extraordinary session of the Diet. They consider it satisfactory, decided to support the government, and are watching the Seiyukai's measures with a tough attitude. (Dentsu dispatch of the 9th)</p>

<p>(Washington) According to today's weekly report from the Department of Commerce, the total value of silver imported into the United States in the week ending February 1 was $3,498,000. The previous week was $8,406,000, and the week before that was $5,498,000. By comparison, it can be seen that the amount of silver imported into the United States in the past week has been greatly reduced, and the active progress of the U.S. Treasury Department's silver purchase program can also be seen. Although the amount of silver entering the United States in the week after January 18 reached as much as $8,406,000, part of it was purchased by the Treasury Department in the past and is not being actively purchased by the U.S. government now. Today, 12 million ounces of silver were shipped from London, some of which will be delivered to the New York Federal Reserve Bank. This batch of silver was purchased in succession using the exchange stabilization fund when the U.S. dollar was strong. (Reuters dispatch of the 8th)</p>

<p>Diameter Greater Than Six Times That of the Earth</p>
<p>Great Impact on Atmospheric Currents</p>
<p>(Berlin) Astronomers here discovered a huge black spot on the western side of the solar disk yesterday. Its diameter is estimated to be 70,000 kilometers, more than six times the diameter of the Earth. The sunspot seen in recent years is the largest this time. (Havas dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) In the bright and cloudless spring days, a large black spot was suddenly discovered on the sun, located in the western part of the solar disk and very clear. According to measurements by German astronomers, the diameter of the black spot is between 60,000 and 70,000 kilometers, while the diameter of the Earth is only 10,000 kilometers. Therefore, an area ten times the size of the Earth would be needed to cover this black spot. According to observations from Earth, it is often possible to discover black spots, but according to speculation, it occurs once every eleven years, so there are few such large spots. However, this black spot may even exist for another twelve or thirteen days. Studies have shown that black spots in the sun have a great impact on atmospheric currents, because they can disrupt the current balance between the planets and can also hinder magnetic needles and affect navigation, aviation, and telephone and wireless communication.

<p>Military Leaders Hold Secret Meeting to Discuss</p>
<p>Government Prepares to Propose to Congress</p>
<p>(Washington) The government is about to submit a plan to Congress to modernize the army, requiring a total expenditure of $408,000,000. The most important items include: 1. Building an air base in the Hawaiian Islands, requiring an expenditure of $11,000,000; 2. Building 800 new-style aircraft, requiring an expenditure of $90,000,000; 3. Strengthening the coastal defenses of the Hawaiian Islands and the Alaskan Peninsula, requiring an expenditure of $2,000,000; 4. Mechanizing the army, requiring an expenditure of $16,000,000; 5. Modernizing infantry and artillery weapons, requiring an expenditure of $8,000,000. Military leaders and members of the Senate Army Committee held a secret meeting today to discuss this plan. This is the first such meeting since Japan announced the abrogation of the Washington Naval Treaty last December. According to Senator McNally, a member of the committee, the decisions made at this meeting are purely defensive in nature, and even if Japan had not announced the abrogation of the Washington Naval Treaty, the United States would have made this decision.

He advocated purchasing 800 armed aircraft, which would cost approximately $90 million, so that the Army Department would have 2,320 new-style aircraft by July 22 for the command of the Army Department Committee.

<p>(Washington) Republican Senator Coubertson declared today that the Philippine issue is a major key to the peace of the Pacific. The Philippine Independence Act will lead to the collapse of the island's economy six years after its implementation, shattering the illusion of the island's independence. Japan hopes to conquer the world economically. The chaotic situation in the East will actually make the neutrality clause worthless.

U.S. officials are currently silent on naval issues, adhering to their policy of believing that calmness is the most effective way to avoid a split and reach a final agreement.

<p>Great Threat to Japan</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a dispatch from Honolulu, the U.S. government has decided to build an air force base on Oahu Island in Honolulu, with a total area of 2,200 acres and an expenditure of US$18 million. Upon completion, this will be the world's best air force base, forming a perfect defense for the Pacific together with the Pearl Harbor base. (Japan United Press dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the news of the U.S. Navy building a large air force base on Oahu Island, the unofficial opinion of the Japanese naval authorities is as follows: The air force base construction plan on Oahu Island is quite large, but the Hawaiian Islands are not within the scope of the Washington Treaty defense agreement, and Japan has no legal basis to protest. Although the Pacific Defense Agreement has disappeared, countries should avoid engaging in activities that threaten other countries. The United States has recently expanded its defense work in Alaska and is preparing to build air force facilities on Pacific islands. This kind of military action will inevitably have an adverse impact on the arms reduction conference that is about to be held. However, the Japanese Navy has sufficient countermeasures against this, and national defense is quite secure. (Japan United Press dispatch of the 9th)</p>

<p>(Vienna) Believing that the Socialist Party will soon rise up, the Austrian authorities today took lightning-fast measures and arrested hundreds of people throughout the country. Soldiers are stationed in all public offices and places in Vienna, and the entire city has suddenly become a military camp. It is reported that a total of 500 social democrats have been arrested in Vienna and the provinces and are detained in so-called "detention centers". Rumors are rife in Vienna, but so far no incidents have occurred. Officials have given conflicting reasons for the current tension. One said that it was due to the increasingly thorough anti-government propaganda. In recent months, the government has been under secret attack by the Socialist Party, whose purpose is clearly to undermine the public's trust in the government and thereby overthrow it. Another said that it was because party members have been continuously smuggling large quantities of military supplies into Austria, which the authorities have been unable to stop. Today, a woman named Gosar, who had previously participated in the Nazi Party incident, was executed in Innsbruck. The whole country is even more tense because of this. It is said that this woman attempted to attack administrator Streer with a bomb last July and was arrested on the spot. Her crime was not determined until today. This is the first time a woman has been executed in Austria. Another Nazi Party conspirator was also executed. (Reuters dispatch of the 8th)</p>

During the banquet, Simon delivered a speech, saying regarding the results of the British-French talks: "I believe that when we were talking in London, we were not only working for the benefit of Britain and France, but also for the welfare and peace of the world. The work we have completed in London is not intended to oppose anyone. We have no intention of establishing a narrow agreement. What we seek is to establish a plan that can serve as a basis for free and equal discussions between all parties concerned, so that the foundation of peace can be more stable. I believe that there will be great progress in 1935. In the political field, international mutual trust will increase day by day. In terms of trade, prosperity can also be gradually restored." Foreign Secretary Simon arrived here from London with his wife this afternoon and will return to Britain tomorrow afternoon. The Foreign Secretary's visit is purely of a private nature.

<p>Budapest The government party (i.e., the National Unity Party) has conflicting opinions on domestic and foreign policy issues and is divided into two factions.

As a result, the political situation is unstable and precarious, but fortunately it tends to ease. This can be seen from the fact that Bethlen's political friends fiercely attacked the leader of the Smallholders' Party, Eckhardt, the other day, but Eckhardt did not retaliate in his speech yesterday. In addition, Regent Horthy has separately received Prime Minister Gömbös and Bethlen and will meet with Eckhardt in the next few days to ease the political tide. (Havas dispatch of the 9th)</p>

<p>Italy Expresses Conditional Participation in Air Pact</p>
<p>Mutual Obligations Between Britain and Italy Must Be Excluded</p>
<p>(Moscow) The French "Moscow Daily News" published an editorial summarizing the views of relevant authorities, stating, "The agreement reached in London by British Foreign Secretary Simon and French Foreign Minister Laval will allow the world to understand Germany's true intentions. This agreement is not without ambiguity. For example, while there is no explicit indication whether Britain is willing to restrain Germany's ambitions in Eastern Europe, the Soviet government should still consider the principles stipulated in this agreement helpful to its own interests. Furthermore, after the conclusion of the London agreement, Moscow raised some reservations about France's actions in consolidating peace in Eastern Europe. However, after the French Ambassador to Russia, Alphand, delivered the original text of the London Declaration and provided oral explanations, the content of the agreement was fully understood. The London agreement invites Germany to participate in the Western European Air Pact and offers extremely important rewards (referring to the abolition of the Versailles Treaty's armament clauses). At the same time, it forces Germany to cease making excuses to refuse international cooperation. Even the bilateral treaties that Germany currently advocates must be abandoned, and the advantages of regional mutual assistance pacts must be recognized. If Germany accepts participation in the Western European Air Pact but still refuses to cooperate in Eastern Europe, it would be tantamount to tacitly admitting Germany's ambition to annex Soviet territory. Conversely, if Germany refuses to cooperate entirely, even refusing to participate in the Western European Pact, then Germany is provoking world opinion and all friends of world peace, and Britain and France would be unable to forgive Germany. In short, the London agreement clearly indicates to Germany that Britain and France want a swift response and are unwilling to engage in endless haggling with Germany. Moreover, French Foreign Minister Laval and Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov signed the Franco-Russian Agreement in Geneva on December 5th of last year (agreeing not to conclude agreements with other countries during the negotiation period of the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact that could hinder these negotiations), which is more than sufficient to deal with everything," and so on. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>(Rome) A communiqué was issued here today, formally stating that Italy is willing to participate in the Anglo-Franco-German-Belgian negotiated Air Pact under certain conditions. The communiqué stated that Italy's position regarding the pact will be decided soon based on a compromise approach in principle, and attention will be paid to the relative special circumstances between Britain and Italy. It is noted that the conclusion of the pact was proposed by Britain and France recently in London, with the sole purpose of consolidating peace. The signatory states undertake to provide air force assistance if any signatory is subjected to an unprovoked air attack by another country. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding Italy's attitude towards the London Anglo-French Agreement, after the Italian government issued a communiqué, political figures believe that the revisions Italy hopes for should be discussed by all countries assuming the signing of the Air Pact before a decision can be made. It is generally believed that the reservations put forward by Italy are the same as the news released by Britain yesterday, that is, Italy accepts the joint signing of the Air Pact by the signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty, but with a separate protocol stipulating that all of Italy's obligations to Britain should be excluded. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) Italy cannot participate in the Air Pact proposed by Britain and France. According to well-informed sources in Britain, Italy's attitude is based on factual reasons. The pact plan stipulates that if one of the signatory countries is attacked by another country's air force, it should jointly resist it. Its nature is entirely mutual. However, as far as Britain and Italy are concerned, Italy believes that sending an air force to Britain to assist in the war is practically impossible, just as it is imaginable that the British air force cannot assist in defending Italian territory. However, Italy agrees that an Air Pact should be signed between the signatory countries of the Locarno Pact, including Italy, but with a separate protocol stipulating that Italy does not bear any obligations to Britain (referring to air force assistance to Britain). As for the issue of mutual air force assistance between Italy and France, the Italian diplomatic authorities have not raised any reservations. (Havas, 8th)</p>

At a time when European countries are preparing to form a broad front to stabilize the situation, it is surprising that Italian newspapers have such views.

<p>Condition for Joining the Central European Pact</p>
<p>(Vienna) According to news from Berlin, regarding Germany's participation in the Central European Non-Interference Pact, the German government's reply is expected to put forward a condition advocating that Austria should have the right to national self-determination. In other words, to hold a plebiscite to decide Austria's fate. Austrian sources believe this news is not credible. If Germany makes such a demand, it would be interfering in Austria's internal affairs. If Germany allows itself to participate in the Non-Interference Pact, it should not be so contradictory. Moreover, Austria, based on the vocational association system, established a Christian Germanic nation-state, which was originally based on the people's self-determination. Austria used its own army to eliminate the rebellions of the National Socialist Party and Marxism, without relying on outsiders. As for other countries forcing Austria to hold a plebiscite, or advising Austria to hold a plebiscite, it is all unacceptable to Austria. Regarding this, Chancellor Schuschnigg declared, "The Austrian plebiscite must wait until the Austrian government believes the time has come and it is done voluntarily by Austria, and it must never follow the will of foreign governments." In short, if Germany responds to the proposals of Britain and France in this way, the result will be greatly regrettable. (Havas, 8th)</p>

<p>(Washington) Congressman Connally suggested to the House of Representatives today that if Mexico does not take measures to stop the abuse of clergy, the United States should withdraw recognition of that country. Connally criticized the US Ambassador to Mexico, Daniels, saying that Daniels is cooperating with cruel people and enslaving the people of Mexico. Senator Borah proposed a similar motion a few days ago. US-Mexico diplomatic relations have suddenly become tense due to the motion. Mexico reacted on the day the motion was proposed, accusing Borah of being responsible for the recent revolutionary conspiracy in Mexico. Connally, chairman of the House Labor Committee, issued a stern attack on Mexican officials, accusing them of encouraging the abuse of clergy and using the army to force people to accept state intervention and atheistic policies. Observers are still unable to predict what impact the tense relations between the two countries will have. It is also uncertain whether Congress will pass Connally's motion. However, it is heard that many other senators and representatives share the same views as Connally and Borah. It is learned that Mexican public sentiment is very angry at Borah's conspiracy to instigate a revolution to overthrow the current government. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>

<p>Bubbles in the Center Indicate Little Value</p>
<p>(London) A former jeweler, claiming to have worked as a secret tester in London for 45 years, has created a diamond indistinguishable from a real one. A real one is worth hundreds of pounds, while his artificial one costs only fifteen pounds. The jewelry industry was greatly alarmed. The London Chamber of Commerce's Diamond and Jewelry Industry Department sent experts to investigate. A formal report was released last night stating that after inspection, the so-called artificial diamond does not contain any diamond substance. Its refractive index and specific gravity are very different from those of a real one. When observed under a microscope, small gas bubbles appear in the center. This kind of imitation diamond has very little commercial value and cannot be used for industrial purposes. All diamond merchants and experts can distinguish its authenticity. According to previous reports, a curio dealer named Gerard in the West End of London claimed that an old man over seventy years old had invented a method of artificially manufacturing diamonds and would bring a diamond, which he estimated to be worth about 400 pounds. The old man later said that it was an artificial stone, and he was greatly mistaken. He had purchased the exclusive rights to sell this artificial diamond. Gerard will be disappointed now that he has seen the expert's report. (Reuters, 8th)</p>

<p>New York: The securities market opened today with more active trading and stable sentiment. Price trends were mixed, but mostly upward. The Dow Jones industrial stock index was 102.41 at the opening, 6 points higher than yesterday's close. However, the securities did not have the momentum to rise sharply, so it is expected that the market today will be quiet and uneventful. As for the general market situation in New York, the Supreme Court's future ruling on the gold clause case is still completely controlling the situation on Wall Street today. Although it is generally felt that no matter what the ruling, it will not affect the government's financial and monetary policies, people's sentiment is inevitably anxious. The fact that Tuesday is a market holiday further exacerbates the severity of the situation. Merchants are mostly standing by and watching, waiting for developments in Washington. Therefore, it is expected that most markets today will be quiet and inactive. However, on the optimistic side, there is indeed evidence of continued progress in industry and commerce, and the good news from London that financial difficulties have been resolved is also exciting.

<p>Urban Industrial Decline, Rural Scene Slightly Better. The implementation of the NRA in the United States has had minimal effect, necessitating a shift to a "new policy." Last summer, the general economic situation improved significantly, but with the arrival of winter, due to seasonal factors, it declined again. In November 1934, the manufacturing and mining industries employed 86,000 fewer workers than in October, which means the number of unemployed increased. Simultaneously, the wages paid by these industries decreased by US$3,915,000, reducing workers' income. If seasonal factors are disregarded, the decline is not considered severe. In November, worker employment only decreased by 1.9% compared to October, while wages decreased by 2.5%. This proves that the American economy is still struggling, and genuine recovery seems quite distant.</p>
<p>Therefore, at the end of November 1934, Federal Emergency Relief Administrator Harry Hopkins advised President Roosevelt, advocating for "completely eradicating poverty in America." The outlines of the EPIA (End Poverty in America) proposal include the following:</p>
<p>(1) Social insurance plan.</p>
<p>(2) Expanding programs to assist farmers and rescue rural areas.</p>
<p>(3) Mass transfer of those living on land with livelihood difficulties to cultured residential areas.</p>
<p>(4) Providing farmers with loans from the national treasury to purchase farm tools and livestock.</p>
<p>(5) Expanding programs for unemployed workers to work in factories.</p>
<p>(6) Planning to allocate large-scale, inexpensive housing to those who cannot become agricultural migrants.</p>
<p>Except for the allocation of inexpensive housing, the remaining items, though small in scale, have been implemented, but their help to the actual economic phenomena in the United States is not significant. Therefore, "Hopkins" believes that if relief costs are to be saved, factories operated by the federal government can come forward to accommodate the unemployed, requiring them to produce according to their own needs, implementing the exchange of products, crops, and goods, but not paying wages. This may save some relief costs, but it is uncertain.</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the NRA policy until now, the Roosevelt government has indeed made its utmost efforts. Though not necessarily effective, it has managed to maintain the status quo. As for the above-mentioned EPIA plan, the total cost required is estimated to be US$90 billion. Assuming its implementation period is two years, it would require an annual expenditure of US$45 billion. Whether satisfactory results can be obtained after implementation remains questionable. However, there is no doubt that today's America needs a large-scale poverty relief movement. Therefore, implementing inflationary policies is also a necessity. If not, the future and current dangers may become even more extensive.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there was a slight increase in some sectors at the beginning of winter. For example, the number of workers in the agricultural tool industry increased by 9.1% in November compared to the previous month. The number of workers in department stores and mail-order businesses also increased by 6.4%. The coal industry, due to increased winter demand, saw a 3.8% increase in coal miners. This certainly has some seasonal factors, but it also contains some elements of economic improvement.</p>
<p>Economic panic is particularly severe in rural areas, especially after the autumn of 1932. Agricultural products fell by 35% compared to before the war, while the prices of industrial manufactured goods they needed rose by 7%. Therefore, the purchasing power of farmers was only 61% of that before the war. This reflected back to the cities, naturally deepening the degree of panic. However, since last autumn, the situation in rural areas has gradually improved. Farmers' income increased from US$5.48 billion in 1933 to US$6.5 billion (which included US$610 million in agricultural relief funds). Compared to the previous year, it still increased by 22%, and rural purchasing power (at the end of November) had risen to 82% of that before the war. Therefore, the agricultural tool industry and others have improved. Unfortunately, this is still a local phenomenon. The 11 million unemployed have not changed much. (January 12th)</p>

<p>The Legislative Yuan held its fourth meeting on the 8th to discuss the draft of the Stock Exchange Transaction Tax Regulations and resolved to approve the amended version. The text of the regulations and the review report are recorded below:</p>
<p>Stock Exchange Transaction Tax Regulations Article 1: All transactions of securities or goods on the stock exchange shall be subject to transaction tax in accordance with the provisions of these regulations. Article 2: The tax rates for the transaction tax are as follows: A. For securities, the tax shall be levied on the agreed price of the transaction. The amount below one hundred yuan in the price shall be calculated as one hundred yuan. No tax shall be levied on spot transactions. For transactions with a delivery period within seven days, the tax shall be 0.04% of the price. For transactions with a delivery period beyond seven days, the tax shall be 0.07% of the price. B. For gold bars (312.50 grams, fineness 978), the tax shall be 7 li of national currency per bar. C. For cotton, the tax shall be 45 cents of national currency per 100 dan. D. For cotton yarn, the tax shall be 1 yuan and 75 cents of national currency per 100 bales. E. For flour, the tax shall be 35 cents of national currency per 1,000 bags. F. For miscellaneous grains, wheat, soybeans, and red sorghum, the tax shall be 35 cents of national currency per vehicle. For soybean cakes, the tax shall be 20 cents of national currency per 1,000 pieces. For soybean oil, the tax shall be 20 cents of national currency per 100 dan. Article 3: The transaction tax shall be collected by the stock exchange from the parties involved in the transaction at the time of the transaction, according to the tax rates stipulated in Article 2, with each party bearing half of the tax. The exchange is responsible for collecting it from the original broker and remitting it together. If the broker fails to collect or delivers an insufficient amount, the stock exchange shall be responsible for paying it on behalf of the broker. Article 4: The stock exchange shall fill out a clear table of the daily transaction volume and prices on the following day, report it to the stock exchange supervisor for verification, and directly pay the transaction tax to the national treasury. Article 5: The stock exchange supervisor may inspect the stock exchange's or broker's books at any time to verify whether there is any concealment or falsification of the transaction volume and prices reported by the stock exchange. Article 6: If the stock exchange fails to make the report in Article 4, pay taxes, violates the prescribed time limit, or the report contains concealment or falsification, it shall be fined up to 500 yuan. If tax evasion results, in addition to collecting the tax payable, a fine of 10 to 30 times the amount of tax evaded shall be imposed. If the stock exchange is penalized due to a broker's violation of regulations, it may transfer the responsibility to the broker. Article 7: If the types of goods traded on the stock exchange are increased or changed, the tax rate shall be revised according to legislative procedures, and the transaction tax shall be levied. Article 8: For transaction taxes in places where transaction tax supervisors are stationed, the Ministry of Finance may entrust local financial authorities or banks to collect and remit them on its behalf. Article 9: These regulations shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.</p>
<p>Review Report: To jointly report. The draft Transaction Tax Regulations case was resolved at the 85th meeting of the previous session of the Yuan and referred to the Finance Committee and the Economic Committee for review, etc. In accordance with this, the first joint meeting of this committee and others was held on January 24th to discuss the matter. Representatives from the Ministry of Finance, the Federation of Stock Exchanges, and the Brokers Association were invited to attend and provide explanations in advance. After discussion, it was decided to submit it to committee members Chen Changheng, Chen Jianru, Zheng Hongnian, Liu Zhendong, and Zhang Zhihan for preliminary review. Subsequently, the preliminary review report from committee members Chen Changheng and others was received, along with a proposed amendment to the draft Transaction Tax Regulations. This was then presented to the second joint meeting of this committee and others for detailed discussion. The reason for amending the transaction tax rate is that securities are subject to a small tax based on price, with spot transactions being tax-exempt and short-term and long-term futures within the futures period being subject to different rates. In addition, the four types of goods—gold bars, cotton, cotton yarn, and flour—are taxed at one-twentieth of the handling fees in the original "Schedule of Handling Fees for Various Traded Goods." The various items under miscellaneous grains—wheat, soybeans, red sorghum, soybean cakes, and soybean oil—are agricultural, industrial, food, or fertilizer necessities, and the tax should be reduced accordingly. Therefore, it is estimated to be taxed at one-fortieth of the standard in the previous table to show differentiation. We immediately separately passed whether it is appropriate, and we should prepare an amendment and submit it to the Yuan for review and decision. Respectfully presented to the President of the Yuan, Sun, and Vice President Shao, with an attached copy of the proposed amendment to the draft Transaction Tax Regulations. Finance and Economic Committee Chairmen Ma Yinchu and Wu Shangying. (September)</p>

<p>Captured Communist Bandit Paraded on Stage for Public Display</p>
<p>Crowds of People Surge to Watch</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Fang Zhimin, the leader of the Communist bandits in the border area of Jiangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Anhui, was captured alive by the troops of the 43rd Independent Brigade under Liu Zhiqing in the Huaiyu Mountains near Nuanshan on the border of Dexing and Yushan at around 4:00 AM on the 29th of last month. Zhao Guantao escorted him from Shangrao to Nanchang in an armored car on the 2nd of this month. Various circles in the provincial capital specially held a "Jiangxi Circles Celebrating the Capture Alive of Bandit Leader Fang Zhimin and Others Assembly" at the Zhongshan Memorial Hall in Yuzhang Park at 12:00 noon on the 6th. Due to the capacity of the venue, each public organization was only allowed to have ten representatives participate. Various circles flocked to the meeting to catch a glimpse of the bandit leader's face. The military police took extremely thorough precautions and guards, with sentries stationed at every step and posts everywhere. Those without proof of documents from organizations could not enter the meeting. Around 11:00 AM, the Zhongshan Memorial Hall was already packed without any space. Around 12:30 PM, the Military Law Office drove Fang Zhimin directly to Yuzhang Park in an armored car. From Beiyingfang to Yuzhang Road, people lined up on both sides, craning their necks to see Fang Zhimin, forming mountains of people, blocking the road. After the car entered the park, several soldiers escorted Fang Zhimin onto the stage from the east side. The bandit leader, who had poisoned four provinces and wreaked havoc for seven or eight years, causing people to shudder at the thought, suddenly met the crowd at the venue. Fang Zhimin stood on the stage, tall, wearing a gray cloth cotton coat, a blue short coat (both newly changed, as he was tattered and filthy when captured), leggings, blue cloth shoes, a flat-top haircut, and a long face with fair complexion. His eyebrows and eyes were quite clear and handsome, and he was plumper than when he served as the provincial party committee and peasant minister in Nanchang sixteen years ago. His beard was about an inch long and had not been shaved. His unkempt appearance showed his embarrassed state of sleeping in the open air and eating in the wind during his escape. At that time, Fang Zhimin stood hunched on the stage, unable to look up, his spirit was depressed and demoralized, like a tiger entering a cage, his fierce flame completely extinguished. Fang Zhimin was on the stage for about three minutes, and after the political training office took magnesium light photographs, a soldier escorted him off the stage and back to the original place in an armored car. The number of people gathered around Beiyingfang Chen Family Ancestral Hall under the camphor tree increased.</p>
<p>After Fang Zhimin left the stage, the assembly officially began. At this time, the crowd dispersed in a commotion. The police and gendarmerie tried their best to maintain order, and order was restored. Yu Baiqing led the ceremony, reported the meaning of the victory celebration, and mostly encouraged the people to comfort the soldiers. Then Zhao Guantao reported the process of encircling and suppressing Fang Zhimin and capturing him alive. After the report, the adjournment of the meeting was announced.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Sichuan Provincial Chairman Liu Xiang's Inaugural Declaration <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The members of the Sichuan Provincial Government are scheduled to take office in Chongqing today (the 10th). Chairman Liu Xiang's inaugural declaration is recorded first. Previously, when reporting on his duties in the capital, Chairman Lin, Chairman Chiang, President Wang, and the officials of the central authorities earnestly encouraged him, all believing that with national crisis at hand, stability was especially urgent. The strategy for suppressing bandits emphasized both politics and military affairs. To advance politics, the structure must be transformed first. Therefore, the Yuan decided to reorganize the Sichuan Provincial Government and ordered the provincial chairman to concurrently serve. He firmly declined, but was unsuccessful and reluctantly accepted the burden. Now, as he begins his term, he deeply feels the weight of responsibility. Considering the meaning of "governing without excessive words," he dares not expect too much of himself. However, remembering that he was appointed in a time of crisis, he must act righteously and not yield too much. He respectfully presents his thoughts and what he and his colleagues should encourage each other with to the elders, brothers, and sisters of Sichuan. He respectfully follows the instructions of the Prime Minister, who always said that revolution must first revolutionize the mind. The people of the country observe the situation in Sichuan, often confined to the old saying "Sichuan is the first to be chaotic when the country is not yet in chaos, and Sichuan is not yet governed when the country is already governed," believing that Sichuan is easy to be chaotic and difficult to govern, which has become a historical constant. In fact, the people of Sichuan's courage to uphold righteousness and sincerity to love the country are always at the forefront and have never been willing to lag behind others. For example, the campaigns to overthrow the Manchus, overthrow Yuan, protect the country, and protect the constitution have all made significant contributions to the country. Although this has stirred up internal conflicts and caused years of war, the glorious history is clearly present. What the world calls chaos first and governance later is mostly abandoning the cause to discuss the effect. Moreover, today's Sichuan, its geographical environment and political environment have greatly changed with the internal and external situations. The life of a province is closely related to the entire life of the Republic of China. Saving Sichuan is saving the country, and there is no other responsibility. Since we have this belief, then today's bandit disaster can help to revitalize the country through hardship. As a person from Sichuan, and bearing the full responsibility for governing the province, he should diligently seek governance, make up for mistakes, and strive for merits to protect the reputation of Sichuan. Filling the sea with stones is his unchanging ambition. This is the first thing he wants to encourage all the elders, brothers, and sisters of Sichuan with. In recent years, the people of Sichuan have been frightened by the bandit disaster and eagerly seek governance, believing that suppressing bandits is more important than military affairs and that politics is not urgent. They do not know that today's bandit disaster has a very significant political nature at its root. The doctrines and policies that the communists madly advocate have already exhausted their tricks, as evidenced by the past events in Jiangxi, and are not worth mentioning. However, the reason why the bandits can sell their deceptive tricks is precisely because there are undeniable weaknesses in our politics, giving them an opportunity to take advantage of. If we can consolidate the people's hearts towards goodness, we can block the mouths of the bandits who incite chaos. If our people have a strict organization, then the bandit chiefs become isolated tyrants. Understanding this meaning, we know that corrupt politics can create bandits, and clear politics can suppress bandits. To suppress bandits with politics, the government that produces clear politics must be thoroughly enriched. To enrich the government, a large group of smart and capable people must become a large group, and working together will achieve daily success. From now on, the government's will is the authority of the will of the people of Sichuan. With one heart and one mind, we will fight together. This is the second thing he wants to encourage all the elders, brothers, and sisters of Sichuan with. Since we clearly recognize our mission of the era, the provincial government's measures should focus on the urgent needs of the era and strive to implement them. After September 18th, the enemy maliciously spread propaganda, always denigrating us by saying "China has no organization." The so-called lack of organization means that each province has its own customs, without escaping the remaining poison of feudal separatism. Therefore, China today needs unity, which is the national consensus of the whole country. When we in Sichuan talk about Sichuan, we should take completing a unified provincial government as the only important meaning at present. Where duty lies, we will dedicate ourselves to it, but still base ourselves on the consistent ambition of impartiality and selflessness, taking coexistence and co-prosperity as the goal. The humble foolishness should be understood and forgiven by compatriots. Since the people recognize the need for unity and are so urgently needed, they should immediately catch up and urge progress. This is what Xiang has been thinking about day and night and wants to encourage all the elders, brothers, and sisters of Sichuan with. Last year, Chairman Chiang based on his experience in suppressing bandits with politics and formulated the outline of the provincial government's joint office method. Jiangxi, Hubei, Fujian, and Anhui have successively implemented it, rectifying regulations and disciplines, and the perceptions are refreshed. Sichuan, eager for unity, can use this as a model. The current report clarifies the central government's intention to formulate rules based on the outline and implement them immediately. All important policies of the provincial government will be based on the central government's common laws and regulations. Reading the Prime Minister's speech on the Five-Power Constitution, it is said, "The government is a big machine." He secretly believes that the activities of all machines have rhythm, relying on the two functions of starting and braking. So is the government. Without a strong driving force, politics cannot be promoted. Without a considerable braking force, politics can easily deviate from the right track. The spirit of the outline is to unify the will of the provincial government and increase administrative efficiency, which is to increase the government's power with centralization and prevent the abuse of power with collective decision-making. The obstacles to the government in politics have been eliminated due to the new legal system, so future facilities should be advanced in accordance with the law without any evasion. The suffering of the people's livelihood is now extreme. Saving from drowning and extinguishing fire is urgent. Remembering the past experience, we dare not say that we will succeed in a matter of days, but remembering that the future can be pursued, how can we bear to belittle ourselves, make empty words, and sell reputation? This is what integrity will not do, and pleasing the crowd and seeking tolerance is also what conscience does not allow. Now, after discussing with colleagues again and again, those who sit down and speak and then act together are: First, carefully select virtuous and capable people, refresh official governance, set up a civil servant qualification review committee, publicly select, and prevent seeking advancement by chance, set up regular training classes to cultivate true talents, and the training method focuses on the study of practical problems, and finally determine the best through assessment, without speaking emptily in the chapters, and strive to make all the excellent talents in society find a way to be useful. Once they are employed, they will be assessed in accordance with the law and used to ensure their security. Those who are outstanding in their governance will be promoted especially, and those who are derelict in their duties will be immediately dismissed, and the provincial government will set up a badge committee to discuss and deal with them in accordance with the law. If they are impartial in their promotion and demotion, they will strive to be diligent. Secondly, the departments of civil affairs, finance, construction, and education plan to correct the accumulated habits of standing side by side and boasting about their achievements, and strive to make solid progress within the limits of manpower and financial resources. In civil affairs, we will rectify official integrity, severely punish corruption, be stern and swift, and shift the atmosphere of the official career. In finance, we will reduce expenses and control consumption, cultivate tax sources, and strive to make the economy self-sufficient and reduce imports. In construction, we will improve local products and develop transportation, and strive to benefit the people and achieve cost-effectiveness. In education, we will make learning practical and diligently practice labor, and strive to integrate production and education. In military affairs, we will improve the quality, be refined, strong, and loyal, and strive to eliminate redundancy and gradually tighten. In short, in the year when the people's strength is declining and everything needs to be rebuilt, all of us should make the people trust the government, then they will work without complaint, and make the people's wealth return to the public, then more acquisitions are not abuse. The burden of the people of Sichuan is too heavy, and it has long been exhausting to lift the tripod. Every time I think about it, I feel deeply guilty. Considering that wealth is the mother of all policies, national economy and people's livelihood must be taken care of. The current situation in Sichuan has long been beset by difficulties from top to bottom. If we stick to the old ways, not only will everything be backward, but it will almost be exhausted. It is proposed that the provincial government set up a financial reorganization committee to consult widely and determine a detailed reorganization plan, and immediately cancel all exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous taxes, and separately set unified provincial taxes, so that the people's burden is average, and the collection method should be reasonable, in order to conform to the principles of fairness and universality. In terms of expenditure, it is decided to practice strict economy, work hard, and reduce the expenses of the military and political affairs and issue them to the people, saving one point of material resources for the people, which is to protect one point of vitality for the society. In the midst of encouraging progress, there is still the intention of recuperating and recuperating. Self-examination is not ashamed, and the public will understand. Dare to say that there is no fault, just do your best. All the things mentioned are humble and without high theory. Eating when hungry and drinking when thirsty, the effect is easy to see. My compatriots, friendship is sincere and righteous, and we have shared hardships for a long time. When we are in the same boat through thick and thin, we will be able to help each other. Looking around, we are in a situation where we can only advance and not retreat. It is not too late to mend the fold, and it is a good opportunity given by God. The great disaster in the future is feared to pass quickly. Xiang has experienced the changes of the world and often feels the vicissitudes of life. Serving the hometown and country, he has long been ashamed of his lack of ability. Only this reverence and respect for the homeland have not been forgotten day and night, and he wants to use the inspiration of sincerity to eliminate the great disaster in one or ten thousand. It is recorded that the gentleman Jiang Jing is strong every day, cultivating himself to安百姓, which shows that our public and private lives are all related to the clarity of politics. The surface is upright and the shadow is correct, without any pretense. As a servant of the people,宁收自荒. Zeng Xiangxiang once said, "All kinds of things from now on are like today's life." Whether the new life of Sichuan can start from now on depends on how we treat ourselves. I sincerely inform you, and I hope you will understand.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Wuhu Commerce Declines <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Bank Business Still Okay, Money Lending Mediocre</p>
<p>Rice Business Sluggish, All Industries Find Recovery Difficult</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Wuhu is the only commercial port in Anhui Province, with convenient transportation, prosperous commerce, and a bustling market. However, the rise and fall of all industries have always depended on the rice market. In recent years, due to the impact of foreign rice dumping, the rice market has been in a slump, and all businesses have been greatly affected. Last year, northern and southern Anhui suffered severe droughts, and southern Anhui counties were plagued by bandits. The market downturn became even more acute, coupled with extremely tight credit. The financial sector did not release large amounts of funds, causing all industries to be in a state of panic. During this difficult period, it was not easy to start a business, and those with insufficient capital were unable to sustain themselves. They laid off shop assistants and tried to tighten their belts. Therefore, after each year's final accounting, countless shop assistants lost their jobs, making life even more difficult, and the social economy became increasingly depressed. According to business practices, after last year's inventory count, the reporter conducted on-site investigations in various industries. Most businesses suffered losses, with only a few managing to cover expenses. In the minds of most businessmen, last year's poor environment had passed away with the old year on New Year's Eve. They only hope that this year's rice market will be active, and that merchants from Guangdong and Chaozhou will boldly engage in business and purchasing, so that Wuhu commerce may have a chance of recovery. The following is a brief overview of the major commercial conditions of last year:</p>
<p>Banks: Wuhu's banking industry has been quite developed in recent years. After the Anhui Bank in Wuhu closed down, the Four Provinces Farmers Bank was added, bringing the total to six banks. Their business is thriving. The Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Shanghai Bank all focus on grain mortgage transactions and provide little to no credit lending. After the year-end closing, there were no bad debt losses, and all banks had profits. According to a recent survey, the banks' mortgage loans are about five million yuan or more, and the total amount of deposits is about ten million yuan. The banks closed for four days during the Spring Festival and added another day for Sunday, resuming business as usual on the 9th.</p>
<p>Money Shops: In the past, money shops were the hub of the financial world. During the active period of the rice market, there were 34 money shops, and their business was extremely prosperous for a time. Each shop had tens of thousands of taels of silver in profit each year. In recent years, rural bankruptcy and market downturns have meant that the industry, which relies on credit lending as its sole business, has suffered huge bad debt losses. Those unable to sustain themselves closed down one after another. Last spring, only seven shops were listed: Xingda, Chengyu, Xingkang, Yuankang, Hengmao, etc. However, they all reduced their scale and did not release large amounts of funds, and there were few bad debt burdens. Although there were slight profits at the end of the year, it was only a matter of appearance. It is said that two more shops will close down this year. The money shop industry is being eliminated by the times, and it is feared that it will no longer have a place in the commercial world.</p>
<p>Rice Business: Wuhu's rice business is divided into purchasing and transportation, rice shops, rice hulling mills, and rice milling. In recent years, due to the dumping of foreign rice in South China, merchants from Guangdong and Chaozhou were forced to shut down, causing the rice market to plummet. Last year, if it were not for merchants from Yantai, Nanjing, Shanghai, and Wuhan, as well as the continuous purchase of military rice, there would have been hardly any rice market to speak of. In the past, the annual export of rice reached eight million shi (a unit of dry measure), but last year it was only about 1.3 to 1.4 million shi. At the end of the year, rice shops from Guangdong and Chaozhou, and Jiangguang rice merchants suffered huge losses due to not having done business for many years. However, rice mills and rice hulling mills all received rice for stockpiling. At that time, the cost was six yuan and several jiao per dan (another unit of dry measure). Later, due to the scarcity of supply, the market price gradually rose, and each dan had to be sold for ten silver dollars. All those who had not sold their rice made huge profits.</p>
<p>Yarn Industry: Wuhu's larger industries are still in their infancy. There is only one yarn factory, Yuzhong, which was founded by Li Boxing and others. It has been in operation for more than ten years and has never made a profit. It has been reorganized several times, but its business is still sluggish. The total accumulated losses over the years amount to more than one million yuan. As for the yarn shops that sell cotton yarn, there are more than a dozen, and their business is relatively stable. Their capital is also very strong, especially Shiyu and Tongchun, whose businesses are the largest. At the end of last year, all yarn shops had profits.</p>
<p>Cloth Industry: Wuhu's silk and cloth industry has suffered losses in recent years due to the plummeting prices of silk goods. In addition, due to the impact of the situation and tight credit, no one has not reduced its scale, and business has gradually declined. In the spring and summer of last year, business was mediocre. By the autumn, businesses competed with each other, offering special discounts and gifts, such as Gongxing, Dacheng, Renji, Qingda, Changxie, and Hongzhang. Transactions were slightly more developed, but expenses were heavy. After the closing, most businesses had mixed fortunes. Gongxing, Qingda, and Changdacheng, etc., still had several thousand taels of silver in profits due to their thicker capital.</p>
<p>Southern Goods: There are more than 100 southern goods businesses of all sizes registered with the trade association. Their business is still not bad, because the goods they sell are necessities for people's daily lives. In the past, Fushengtai from Fujian and Wang Yulong from Anhui were the leaders in the industry. Their annual turnover was about 300,000 yuan. In recent years, due to the market situation, people's purchasing power has weakened, and transactions have been greatly reduced. Wang Yulong has closed down, and Fushengtai's annual turnover is also less than 100,000 yuan. If one business is like this, the situation of other businesses can be imagined. From spring to winter last year, prices were stable, and there was generally no profit to be made. However, in November of winter, oil prices soared, and all those with large inventories made huge profits.</p>
<p>In addition, industries such as hardware, timber, pawnshops, medicine, general merchandise, soap, dyeing, silver shops, restaurants, and paper have all had less business than in previous years, and it can be said that there are no profits. It is said that many shops will close down this year. This state of decline has not been seen in decades. (8th)</p>

The review was completed on the 7th, and a second meeting was held on the 8th, focusing on the reorganization of taxes and the abolition of excessive and miscellaneous taxes. More than twenty cases were decided, roughly: (1) Dividing tax collection areas. The business tax of seventeen small counties in northwestern Hubei will be collected by the nearby Business Tax Bureau. (2) Regularly carrying out province-wide inspections of shop ledgers to prevent concealment. (3) Establishing waterway checkpoints to prevent evasion. (4) Urging the collection of new and old outstanding taxes, with tax reductions and exemptions for disaster areas. (5) Reorganizing the brewing industry and banning pawnshop agencies. (6) Thoroughly abolishing excessive and miscellaneous taxes to reduce the burden on the people. (7) Increasing the salaries of staff in various tax bureaus and strictly defining rewards and punishments to encourage and warn them. The closing ceremony was held that evening. (8th)</p>

<p>Guo Amao from Guojiacun, Naxiang, formerly robbed Cantonese people in the vicinity. He was sentenced to imprisonment by the county. During the Japanese occupation of the county, he escaped from prison. There were still seven years left in his sentence. After the county was restored, he was wanted by the High Court. He hid in other places and continued to break the law. On the one hand, he colluded with lake bandits, and on the other hand, he colluded with local gangsters. In the autumn of the 21st year, he gathered a group to rob two rifles from the Chaxi Self-Defense Force. The robbery cases in the southwest countryside last winter were also closely related to Guo. He recently sneaked back to his hometown and hid in the home of relatives in Pengjiacun nearby. This was discovered by the Chaxi Sentinel. They met with Zhang Tiange, the patrol chief of the Naxiang Public Security Substation, and went to arrest him at 1:00 a.m. on the 2nd. Guo heard the sound and tried to escape through the roof, but was arrested and taken to the Naxiang Substation. After interrogation by Patrol Officer Cao Hanqing, he confessed that Chen Kunlin from Fang Taixi Township was his accomplice. That night, Chen was also arrested.</p>

<p>This county is implementing cocoon market control. Last year, the cocoon merchants repeatedly requested that it be postponed for one year, which was approved. The spring cocoon season is approaching soon. The Construction Department believes that this county is the central area of sericulture in the province and should actively promote control to achieve the purpose of improvement. Guan Yida was specially sent to Wuxi to contact the cocoon merchants' association and decided to implement control this year. Five principles were drafted and submitted to the provincial capital for approval and implementation.</p>

<p>In order to understand the situation of charitable undertakings in various counties in Jiangsu Province and improve them, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs specially appointed Xiang Dating to inspect Wuxi. Yesterday, Commissioner Xiang, accompanied by Feng Baoyi, a staff member of the county government, and Qin Zhenhua of the Relief Home, first went to Chong'an Temple Hengshantang, as well as the Free Clinic, Infant Home, and Tongrentang, etc., to visit. Then he went to the Civilian Vocational Training Center outside the South Gate to visit the rope-making, box-making, and sewing workshops. Finally, he investigated Pujitang and visited the nursing home. The home takes care of one hundred elderly people over the age of 60, who gathered in a hall, standing respectfully to await Commissioner Xiang's personal condolences before dispersing. It is planned to continue investigating all public and private hospitals in the county today.</p>

<p>The family of Wang Jinhai, a villager in Hehuatang near Liaoyipu in the southern suburbs of Wuyi, has some assets and is quite well-off. Unexpectedly, at about 1:00 a.m. on the 7th, more than ten armed bandits suddenly came, broke into the house, twisted the homeowner Wang Jinhai, and demanded silver dollars. Wang resisted at the time, causing him to be stabbed once by the bandits, and his right forehead was severely injured. During the struggle, one of the bandits was also cut. The bandits then searched at will and took away silver dollars, clothing, and other items.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Jiangyin Villager Killed While Performing Dragon Lantern Dance <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>In Huangdan, ten miles west of the city in the western countryside of the seventh district, the village was disturbed by the bandit Gao Xiaosheng the year before last, and the villagers were almost turned into bandits. After Gao was brought to justice, the area gradually became peaceful. The day before yesterday (the 5th) was the second day of the first lunar month of the old calendar. The villagers there started a large dragon lantern dance, going back and forth in the village, in high spirits. Later, due to the "dazhao" relationship (dragon lanterns are greeted with firecrackers, and must be carried back and forth, called "dazhao"), it led to a conflict between villagers. A villager, Kuang Yingen, was hit in the head by a long bench, causing serious injuries and death. Subsequently, the local merchant group arrested Xie Chunyuan, Xie Chunlin, Xu Fugeng, Geng Taili, and Zhou Henggui, the five people who were performing the lantern dance, and sent them to the county on the 7th. In the morning, Judge Jiang went to the countryside to examine the body. On the same day, a nameless male corpse was found in the third section of Houmei, with injuries, seemingly thrown into the river after being sexually assaulted. Judge Jiang did not return to the city until the afternoon of the 8th.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Commerce After the Year-End Closing <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Cheng County's commerce was affected by the drought and famine last year, coupled with the decline of the rural economy. It can be said that all industries were depressed. The accounts after the year-end closing were only 50-60%. Fortunately, the money shop industry was still good. The most developed cloth factory industry, such as Huacheng, with a larger scale, still had a lot of inventory and poor sales, and its business was far from what it used to be. The other public welfare Rongxi factories only weave customized goods and have a small profit. The silk and cloth industry has declined sharply because the traffic between Xicheng and Zhencheng is convenient, and buyers tend to go to other ports. Many businesses have closed down, such as Wanyusen. The remaining yarn and rice industries are just stable.</p>

<p>The Department of Finance recently issued instructions to the Danyang Puzhen Vegetable and Cattle Inspection Office of various business tax bureaus and collection offices, saying that the agencies under the department are responsible for collection and are very important. Fire prevention must be implemented. The points that should be noted are listed on the left: (1) The house you live in is best to be a detached house, and there must be an emergency exit. Those who live upstairs must pay special attention to the convenience of the staircase exit. If you live with the landlord or other tenants, you must be separated from each other and not live together in a mixed manner. (2) There must be a well or water stored in a tank. Do not pile up flammable materials, or use kerosene stoves and other things in the bedroom, so as to be prepared for emergencies. (3) The taxes collected, whether cash or banknotes, must be sent to the treasury for deposit and must not be kept privately. (4) Blank receipts received from the department, or those that have been used but not reported and verified, as well as various account books, etc., should be collected in one place every night and stored safely in a locked wicker box or other box, so that they can be easily moved in case of an emergency. (5) Every night or on holidays, responsible personnel must be assigned to stay in the agency and must not leave completely. All of the above points should be paid special attention to and strictly followed. In addition, if there are other fire prevention procedures, they should also be supplemented and handled as appropriate.</p>

<h3 id="e129">Letter from Songjiang Telephone Company <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Dear Editor: I read a letter in your newspaper from the Songjiang Electric and Steam Company, which stated that the telephone poles were knocked down in as many as nine places due to snow. This is very surprising. Upon investigation, our company's lines only had poles leaning against the stone archway at Beicang Bridge, and the focal point was not there, but at the entrance of Chayuan Lane. The electric light company exaggerated the situation in order to avoid the use of sheathed wire at the intersection and shift the blame to our company. Therefore, we hereby declare, and hope you will check and correct it. Sincerely, Songjiang Telephone Company, September 9th.</p>

<h3 id="e130">A Review of the World Economy in 1934 (4) by Ou Muchu <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Stock prices rose across the board, except in countries that maintained the gold standard. Low interest rates especially proved the surplus of capital. This is evidence that a chronic economic panic is still continuing.</p>
<p>Moreover, the foundation of the panic is built on overproduction. We dare not say that the reason why the world economy in 1934 has escaped the panic is because overproduction still exists. Various "production restrictions" and "production reduction agreements" are clear evidence. However, "production restriction" is neither a reasonable economic law, nor does it have the danger of making things more confusing. In addition, the budget of various countries has a large deficit, and there must be an urgent method to overcome the economic crisis, so seizing and promoting new markets for surplus goods has become the only means for the great powers. Therefore, some countries used the opportunity to plunder the territory of other countries as colonies; for example, Japan forcibly seized my Northeast provinces. Some countries, due to geographical relations, have to use their economic power to conquer the world in order to expand the market, such as the United States' abandonment of the gold standard, the implementation of currency inflation, and the devaluation of exchange rates. Of course, the adoption of political and military power to expand its market has not forgotten the use of its economic power. We will not talk about the use of political and military plunder of the world market for the time being. Here we only talk about the general situation of the competition for the market by economic power. The fact that the great powers used their superior economic power to plunder the world market was most obvious in 1934. Now we will list a few important facts as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Currency Inflation The amount of banknotes in circulation is the best example of currency inflation. The table below lists the amount of banknotes in circulation in major countries in the world:</p>
<p>Japan United Kingdom Germany France United States Issuance Amount Circulation Amount Circulation Amount Circulation Amount Circulation Amount Million Yen Million Pounds Million Marks Million Francs Million US Dollars 1913 426 30 2,742 5,714 3,364 January 1933 1,109 355 3,271 83,591 2,697 April 1,025 376 3,423 84,623 3,477 July 1,102 378 3,338 83,907 3,067 October 1,101 371 3,426 81,668 2,994 January 1934 1,150 366 3,354 80,838 2,960 February 1,207 366 3,295 81,393 2,953 March 1,087 370 3,357 81,938 2,989 April 1,119 374 3,429 81,631 3,030 May 1,075 378 3,461 81,088 3,061 June 1,061 379 3,485 80,789 3,054 July 1,110 385 3,596 81,892 3,098 August 1,110 384 3,594 81,000 3,102 September 1,049 379 3,662 81,017 3,148 October 1,124 377 3,697 80,348 3,182 (From "Where is the World Going" First Half of 1934, Page 57, Second Half of 1934, Page 40) The amount of issuance and circulation of banknotes in various countries has increased a lot compared with before the European War. Although the increase between 1933 and 1934 is very small, it is because of the compensation for public debt. And the debts of various countries have now reached saturation. The deficit in the future can no longer be taken from public debt, and the scope of currency inflation will inevitably be further expanded, which is worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>(2) Exchange Rate Devaluation Lowering the exchange rate is the best way to encourage foreign exports. Let's look at the changes in the exchange rates of various countries. (1) New and old parities of major countries in the world against the US exchange rate</p>
<p>Currency Unit New Parity Old Parity Gold Dollar United Kingdom Te 8.2397 4.8666 France Franc 0.0663 0.0392 Germany Mark 0.4033 0.2382 Netherlands Guilder 0.6806 0.4020 Italy Lira 0.0891 0.0526 Belgium Belga 0.2354 0.1930 Switzerland Franc 0.3267 0.1930 Spain Peseta 0.3267 0.1930 Japan Yen 0.8440 0.4985 Australia Shilling 0.2382 0.1407 Canada Gold Dollar 1.6931 1.0000 (2) US-French Exchange Rate</p>

<h3 id="e131">Five Banks Organize Agricultural Loan Group, Established Yesterday <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>This year's investment amount is set at 3 million yuan</p>
<p>Hope other banks will participate in cooperation</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the Agricultural Cooperative Loan Group organized by the Bank of Communications, Jincheng Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank, and Four Provinces Farmers Bank held an establishment meeting at the Bank of Communications on the Bund yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m. It was resolved to elect executive directors and approve several important cases, such as the amount of loans to be released. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e132">Start of Meeting <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Those who attended the meeting yesterday included Li Zhongchu of the Bank of Communications, Wu Xiaoyuan of Jincheng Bank, Yang Yinpu of Zhejiang Industrial Bank (representing Shi Daochun), Zou Bingwen of Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank, and Zhu Runsheng of Four Provinces Farmers Bank. The meeting started at 3:00 p.m.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Election of Executive Directors <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The representatives of the five banks are all directors. Li Zhongchu and Zou Bingwen were elected as executive directors from among the five directors. The organization of the group completely adopts the form of the General Administration Office. In the future, offices will be established in Henan, Hebei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shaanxi to directly manage investment matters in each province and obey the command of the group. The establishment of the offices will have to wait for some time, as all procedures are still under discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Investment Amount <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>As for the banks' investment in rural areas, it has already started last year. However, the five banks acted individually. In the past year, Shaanxi Province was the only one limited, with an amount of about one million yuan. This time, the banks, in view of the importance of investing in rural areas, decided to adopt an overall plan to unify it. At yesterday's meeting, it was decided that the investment amount for this year will be limited to 3 million yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Office Location <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>At yesterday's meeting, the group also decided to temporarily use the Bank of Communications as its office. In order to achieve the effect of gathering strength and wisdom, the group very much hopes that other banks will participate in this initiative. In the future, if other banks participate, each bank can appoint a representative to serve as a director, so as to jointly discuss the method of investing in rural areas. Currently, apart from the five banks, no other banks have formally expressed their participation, but it is expected that the number of participating banks will increase after a considerable period of time.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Discussion of Regulations <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The group's regulations have now been drafted and were submitted for discussion at yesterday's meeting. However, the regulations are of great importance and should be considered with extra care. Therefore, at yesterday's meeting, although a long time was spent researching and revising them, it was still felt that there were some imperfections. It was resolved that the directors would further study them separately outside the meeting and then submit them to the next meeting for discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Financial Advisory Committee Did Not Establish as Scheduled Yesterday <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Due to Minister Kong Suffering from a Slight Cold</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that after the Ministry of Finance hired Li Fuxun and other fourteen people as members of the Financial Advisory Committee, the inaugural meeting was originally scheduled to be held at the Central Bank yesterday afternoon at 4:00 p.m. However, due to Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi suffering from a slight cold and not yet fully recovered, it was not established as scheduled. Therefore, the establishment date of the committee will be decided and notified to the members after Minister Kong recovers, so that the inaugural meeting can be convened.</p>
<h3 id="e138">League of Nations Expert, Woermodo, Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Scheduled to Return to Europe on the 13th</p>
<p>Mr. Woermodo, a League of Nations water conservancy expert, having previously visited various parts of North and Northwest China to inspect water conservancy projects such as the Yellow River and the Jingwei Canal, returned to Beijing a few days ago. Considering his term in China was complete, he immediately drafted a report on his observations and research results. After finishing this task, he bid farewell to the relevant authorities in Beijing and, accompanied by his secretary, Mr. Sattley, arrived in Shanghai at 7:15 AM yesterday on the night express train. He immediately visited Mr. Haas, the League of Nations Liaison for Technical Cooperation in China, to report everything. He has also decided to return to Europe on the Italian postal ship "Conte Verde" on the 13th of this month. According to Mr. Wu Xiufeng, a League of Nations secretary on leave returning to China, the proposals from various parties in our country to retain Mr. Woermodo for further work in China have now become a thing of the past. Mr. Woermodo believes that his mission to China was solely to assist in Chinese water conservancy. The results of his inspection showed that the Yellow River dredging project is the most important, but it requires an estimated 100 million yuan, which is beyond the current financial capacity. Therefore, Mr. Woermodo believes that there is currently no need for him to remain in China and, as his term in China has ended, he has decided to return to Europe first. It is reported that Mr. Woermodo is Italian and serves as a reporter for the League of Nations Committee on Communications and Public Works. He was hired to come to China at the beginning of November last year.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Haas Visits Song Yesterday Afternoon <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Gu Weijun Hosts Afternoon Tea Reception the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>Haas to Visit Wang Zhengting Today Before Going to Beijing</p>
<p>Mr. Haas, the newly appointed League of Nations Liaison for Technical Cooperation in China, had already visited Mr. Song Ziwen, a Standing Committee member of the National Economic Council, upon his arrival in Shanghai. However, at that time, Mr. Song was slightly unwell and they did not have a thorough discussion. Now that Mr. Song has recovered, Mr. Haas drove to Mr. Song's private residence on Qiqi Road again at 11:00 AM yesterday to seek instructions on everything, so that he can decide on his work procedure in China. The conversation lasted for an hour before he departed. Mr. and Mrs. Gu Weijun, the Minister to France, specially hosted a tea party at their private residence on Xifei Road the day before yesterday afternoon to entertain Mr. and Mrs. Haas, inviting Mr. and Mrs. Wu Xiufeng, a League of Nations secretary on leave returning to China, to accompany them. In addition, Mr. Haas is scheduled to visit Mr. Wang Zhengting, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, at 11:00 AM today, and then take the 11:00 PM night express train to Beijing with Mr. Wu Xiufeng and Mr. Tillo, the League of Nations Secretary in China.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Huang Fu Entertains Japanese Press Corps <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Hopes Japanese Will Treat China with Sincerity</p>
<p>The Japanese newspaper "Mainichi Shimbun" reported on the 9th that Mr. Huang Fu, Chairman of the Beiping Political Affairs Committee, who arrived in Shanghai on the 2nd, entertained the Japanese press corps stationed in Shanghai at his private residence on Qiqi Road in the French Concession on the 8th. The meeting lasted for 50 minutes, and the content was as follows: "My health has almost recovered, but my hand is still not comfortable and my blood pressure is also low, so I will stay in Shanghai for medical treatment until the end of this month. Next month, I will go to my hometown of Hangzhou for about a week, and then return to Shanghai, transfer to Nanjing, and return to Beiping. Chairman Jiang has gone to Nanchang. When I met with Jiang before, there was nothing special. There are many rumors outside about whether I will take office as Minister of the Interior, but I have not yet made a decision. If the situation changes, it is also possible to take office. When Chairman Jiang and Lieutenant General Suzuki and Yoshiya Company representatives held talks in Nanjing before, I also attended the meeting. This meeting can enable both China and Japan to understand each other with sincerity. Chairman Jiang has no personal grievances against Japan at all. Since the anti-communist movement began, he has long had the intention of cooperating with Japan. The cooperation between China and Japan is indeed the best policy to ensure peace in the East. China's past history is sufficient to prove this. However, since the Jinan Incident, the relationship between China and Japan has gradually deteriorated. This was not the original intention of the two peoples, and it was caused by sudden disasters. In the future, it is expected that the two peoples will restore a normal state. As for the specific preconditions between China and Japan, we must first start with sincerity. When the former South Da General went to Manchuria to take office, he said, 'We must first remove the sense of superiority of the Japanese in Manchuria, and then we can adjust the relationship between China and Japan.' The Japanese sense of superiority and China's anti-Japanese sentiment are mutually causal. If both are allowed to go unchecked, they will inevitably fall into an irretrievable situation. Therefore, please ask Japan to first remove the long-standing sense of superiority in China and transform it into an equal attitude, then China can naturally remove the resentment of anti-Japanese sentiment. This is the prerequisite for the rapprochement between China and Japan, and the people of both countries can consolidate cooperation with sincerity. The way to permanent peace in the East lies within this. Originally, human society is quite complex, and it is impossible to judge the whole by one part. We should open our eyes and take into account the overall situation. If there are occasional isolated phenomena, and we consider it to be a general problem, this kind of observation is extremely dangerous. If Japan is willing to abandon suspicion and treat China with sincerity, how can China abandon this good neighbor and not listen to cooperation? I hope that in the future, we will show each other our hearts and restore normal relations," he said.</p>

<p>Wang Chonghui Decides to Go Abroad Within the Month</p>
<p>Ma Chaojun Visits Wang Yesterday to Discuss Personnel Selection</p>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports that Mr. Ma Chaojun, a member of the Central Committee, believes that since Dr. Wang Chonghui is about to go abroad, the progress of domestic unity and cooperation, although mature, still has unfinished matters that need to be succeeded by appropriate personnel. Therefore, at around 9:30 yesterday morning, he drove to the private residence of Mr. Wei Daoming, the former Vice Minister of Justice, on Hague Road to visit Wang and discuss appropriate candidates. The two men talked for about an hour and left at 10:30.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Mr. Wang's Remarks <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>After Mr. Ma left, Mr. Wang received reporters and stated that, so far, the various parties have indeed gained considerable understanding on the issue of domestic unity, but the exchange of views still depends on the efforts of those who travel around and mediate. Mr. Ma came to visit just now to discuss this issue. In terms of personnel selection, the general public favors Mr. Li Shizeng, who has just returned from France. I met with Li before, but did not mention this matter in a hurry. I will formally visit him within a few days to seek his consent. There should be no problem.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Domestic Situation <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Wang then talked about the general concepts in the country, saying briefly, "I returned to the country during my vacation this time and traveled north and south for several months. I feel that although our country is still in economic and political difficulties, there has been considerable progress in terms of material production, construction, and the spirit of the people. The people's attention to the government's political measures and current affairs is far from the previous indifference. All these points are gratifying phenomena. However, due to the continuous natural disasters and man-made disasters in the country, the people's lives and the foundation of the national economy have been shaken, so we still need the concerted efforts of the whole country to seek stability."</p>

More than 20 representatives from various sectors, including the Auditing Department, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the National Debt Fund Management Committee, the Bankers' Association, and the Money Dealers' Association, attended.

All winning bonds will be paid, together with the thirteenth interest payment, by the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Third Bank in various places starting from the 28th of this month. Regardless of the location, payment will be made in silver dollars. Please inspect the tickets and ticket registers, so that the drawing can be executed."</p>

All creditors of the bank are requested to register their claims with the office of liquidation within fourteen days. All debtors are also required to pay their debts to the office of liquidation within the same time limit. This is hereby announced."</p>

<p>Shallow Water in Tongzhou Makes Towing Ineffective</p>
<p>The Qitai steamer of Jiejian Company originally operated on the Sichuan River route. In recent days, due to the large reduction in river water in the Yichang-Yibin section, the steamer came to Shanghai from Yichang, fully loaded with grains and other items. Because the steamer's draft was shallower than the river steamers of other companies, it was safe and sound. On the 6th of this month, when the steamer reached the Tongzhou river surface, it encountered a high tide with turbulent water. The Qitai was also a fully loaded steamer, making it difficult to resist. The captain, in order to ensure the safety of navigation, immediately dropped anchor and stopped to avoid the brunt of the tide. When the anchor was dropped, the water scale in the river was measured to be more than eight feet. The captain planned to wait for the water to settle down a bit before sailing, but unexpectedly, the water suddenly receded, and the rate of decrease was even more unexpected. It suddenly receded to five feet, and the Qitai ran aground.</p>

<p>The captain was unable to move away from the sandbar and sent out a distress signal, which was detected by the Jianghai Customs patrol ship. The patrol ship immediately sailed to the location where the Qitai was aground to assist in towing, but even with full power, it could not be moved at all. The water level was continuing to decrease. The Customs patrol ship saw that the situation was not good and immediately stopped towing and sailed away. If it had been a step slower, the patrol ship would also have been stranded. The captain had no choice but to wire the Shanghai company to request a steamer to come to the rescue.</p>

<p>Upon receiving the report, the Jiejian Company immediately dispatched the Yian steamer to the Tongzhou sandbar yesterday morning to find a way to tow it. Yesterday afternoon, according to the company's news, the Yian steamer arrived at the location where the Qitai steamer was aground and attempted to tow it, but it also failed. The company plans to have the Yian tow it again during high tide. If it is still ineffective, a tugboat will be sent from Shanghai to unload the cargo, reduce its weight, and then tow it.</p>

<p>Reportedly, Pirates Are Active Again in Dapeng Bay</p>
<p>The "Great American Evening News" reports that the Tongzhou ship sailed to Yantai again after 10:00 AM today (the 9th). Except for two children who remained in Shanghai due to illness, all the children carried on the last trip to Yantai took the ship north again. The ship did not carry Chinese passengers, but a French troop happened to need to be transferred to North China, so they attached to the ship. Captain Simat, because the authorities' investigation of the piracy case has not been completed, must stay in Shanghai temporarily, so he was replaced by Captain Fischer, the former captain of the Shengjing steamer. However, when the ship set sail, Simat still came to the dock to take care of the children, and all the children cheered to him, because Simat risked his life to protect the children during the piracy, so they were moved and expressed their gratitude to him. Today, according to Taikoo Company, three pirates were shot and wounded during the piracy that day. It is also heard that the non-public investigation and evidence collection by Taikoo Company was completed today, and it was originally scheduled for Simat to publish an announcement at noon today, but it was temporarily postponed to 5:00 PM. According to Hong Kong newspapers, on February 3, the Hong Kong Police Headquarters received a confidential report that a group of pirates had left Dapeng Bay again, and their whereabouts were unknown, probably to Shanghai, Guangzhou, Tianjin, and other places.</p>

<h3 id="e155">Convenient for Telephone Users in the South City to Send Telegrams <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>To be Implemented from March 1</p>
<p>In order to make it convenient for users of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau to send telegrams, the Ministry of Communications has promulgated "Measures for Shanghai Telephone Bureau Users to Transmit Telegrams by Telephone," which will be implemented from March 1 of this year. After receiving the order, the two bureaus of Shanghai Telephone and Telegraph have prepared to implement it as scheduled and have notified users of the measures yesterday. The following is a summary of the measures: (1) All users of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications (hereinafter referred to as "users"), whether in the South City, Longhua, Zhabei, Pudong, or the city center, may transmit telegrams by telephone in accordance with these measures. (2) Users who wish to transmit telegrams by telephone should follow the following procedures: (a) Call telephones No. 21193 or 21194 in the South City (these telephones are located in the Republic of China Road Receiving and Dispatching Office of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau); (b) After the user hears the reply from the Telegraph Bureau, they must report the telephone number and account name clearly (the Telegraph Bureau may inquire about the sender's name, position, or other matters to prove that they are indeed the user themselves or someone who can be held responsible. If the Telegraph Bureau considers it suspicious, it may ask the sender to write the telegram themselves and send it to the bureau for transmission); (c) Hang up the telephone and wait for the Telegraph Bureau personnel to notify them to send the telegram; (d) When the Telegraph Bureau personnel call the original number again to ask for the telephone number and account name, the user must repeat it. If it matches, they can start sending the telegram; (e) Users who send Chinese telegrams, whether clear or coded, must translate them into code in advance. When sending the telegram, they should read out the code word by word on the telephone so that the Telegraph Bureau personnel can record it. However, in order to avoid mishearing, the code should be read out in the following manner when necessary (reading method omitted); (f) Users who transmit foreign language telegrams must read out the letters one by one. When necessary, the letters should be read out in the following manner (reading method omitted); (g) After the user has finished transmitting the telegram, the Telegraph Bureau personnel will repeat it once. If the proofreading is correct, the recorded telegram will be sent out by machine and a copy will be prepared, stating the amount of telegram fee to be collected (to be collected in total at the end of the month) and delivered to the original sender by the deliveryman to be reviewed, signed, and stamped in person, and then returned to the Telegraph Bureau by the original deliveryman for safekeeping as proof. If the sender finds any errors, they should immediately notify the Telegraph Bureau by telephone to send a public telegram to correct them. The fee for this public telegram will still be charged according to regulations. The procedure for reviewing telegram copies must be handled quickly to avoid delaying the deliveryman's time. If the sender is out, their family or entrusted person may sign and stamp to be responsible for the review or collect it on their behalf and leave it for the Telegraph Bureau to send a deliveryman to pick it up the next day; (3) After a telegram transmitted by telephone reaches its destination, if the recipient has any questions and calls to inquire, the Telegraph Bureau should first check and correct the telegram base received on the telephone. If there are no errors in the telegram base check, the sender should be notified by telephone to recheck. If there are errors, a charged public telegram should be used to correct them. The fee for this charged public telegram will still be charged according to regulations; (4) After the user has finished transmitting the telegram or the charged public telegram, they may ask how much the total telegram fee is. The Telegraph Bureau personnel should immediately calculate and reply. If the sender does not inquire, the Telegraph Bureau personnel will not notify them on the telephone in order to avoid delaying the time of sending the telegram; (5) The telegram fees for telegrams transmitted by telephone will be recorded by the Telegraph Bureau at any time, and at the end of the month, the Telegraph Bureau will fill out a bill according to the number of each user and send it to the Telephone Bureau. The Telephone Bureau will then collect the telegram fees from the users on behalf of the Telegraph Bureau. If there are any arrears, the Telephone Bureau will handle them in the same way as the arrears of telephone charges; (6) The Telegraph Bureau will not collect a deposit from users who transmit these accounting telegrams, but the deposit paid by the user to the Telephone Bureau will also serve as a deposit; (7) If the total telegram fee payable by a user who sends more telegrams reaches 50 yuan by any day of the month, the Telegraph Bureau should immediately notify the user to register directly with the Telegraph Bureau in accordance with the Measures for the Sending and Receiving of Telegrams by Urban Telephones promulgated by the Ministry of Communications and deposit the telegram fee in advance before continuing to send telegrams; (8) The method of transmitting telegrams by telephone is temporarily limited to ordinary telegrams, urgent telegrams, and social telegrams sent to various places in the country. Other types of telegrams are not applicable; (9) Telephones installed in institutions, groups, schools, hotels, teahouses, restaurants, theaters, bathhouses, and other public places are not subject to these regulations unless the user notifies the Telephone Bureau in writing that they are willing to transmit telegrams in accordance with these measures and is responsible for paying the telegram fees; (10) These measures do not apply to public telephones or telephone users in the concessions, or to users in arrears with telephone charges (the Telephone Bureau will notify the Telegraph Bureau at any time); (11) These measures will be implemented on a trial basis from March 1, 24th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the Beiping Chamber of Commerce requesting that it be forwarded to the Ministry of Industry to establish large factories in Beiping in order to benefit industrial construction and that it should consistently advocate for this. The Chamber cabled the Ministry for action last month. The Chamber received a reply from the Ministry of Industry yesterday, which is recorded as follows: "I received the cable on behalf of you. This case was previously submitted to the Ministry by the Beiping Chamber of Commerce. I believe that the Ministry of Industry, in order to develop large factories to benefit people's livelihood, approved the promulgation of the Measures for the Establishment of People's Livelihood Factories in Counties and Cities in September of the 21st year and issued a circular to the provincial and municipal governments in March of the 22nd year to implement the measures in accordance with the aforementioned measures. The request of the Chamber of Commerce is intended to develop local industries, which is in line with the main purpose of the previous order." A separate letter was sent to the Executive Yuan's Political Affairs Committee in Beiping and the Beiping Municipal Government to consider and handle the matter and to notify all parties concerned.</p>

<p>New Measures for Railway Transportation of Copper Coins, Cash Coins, and Copper Ingots</p>
<h3 id="e159">Ministry of Railways Instructions <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The two railway administrations received Instruction No. 399 from the Ministry of Railways, stating: This Ministry has previously received a consultation from the Ministry of Finance stating that inferior copper coins are rampant on the market and should be strictly prohibited. Please instruct all railway bureaus to strictly inspect and enforce the "Measures for the Transportation of Copper Coins by State-Owned Railways" to confiscate them and prevent private transportation to emphasize the ban. After verification by this Ministry, the original "Measures for the Transportation of Copper Coins, Cash Coins, and Copper Ingots by State-Owned Railways" did not specify the confiscation of privately transported copper coins without a license, the reporting procedures for the confiscation of privately transported copper coins, the reward methods for those who discover privately transported copper coins, and the conversion rates for copper coins worth 50, 100, and 200. Therefore, difficulties inevitably arise during implementation. This Ministry has revised and supplemented the original measures and has obtained the approval of the Ministry of Finance after consultation. In addition to the general order, a copy of these revised measures is urgently copied and issued to the road, so that it can be followed and ordered to strictly check the necessity of the order. The bureau has instructed the traffic office to follow the order.</p>

<p>Revised Measures for the Transportation of Copper Coins, Cash Coins, and Copper Ingots by State-Owned Railways: (1) Passengers traveling by train who carry single copper coins (i.e., ten-wen copper coins) within 2,000 pieces, or double copper coins (i.e., twenty-wen copper coins) within 1,000 pieces, or cash coins within 5,000 pieces, are exempt from freight charges. (2) Passengers who carry single copper coins exceeding 2,000 but not exceeding 20,000 pieces, or double copper coins exceeding 1,000 but not exceeding 10,000 pieces, or cash coins exceeding 5,000 but not exceeding 50,000 pieces, shall pay freight charges and be issued a ticket for shipment.

If no one claims the goods, they shall be confiscated. (3) Passengers who carry single copper coins exceeding 20,000 pieces, or double copper coins exceeding 10,000 pieces, or cash coins exceeding 50,000 pieces, shall hold a passport issued by the provincial, municipal, or county government for travel within the province, or a passport issued by the Ministry of Finance for transport to other provinces. Both shall be presented to the station for verification at the time of reporting for shipment and payment of fees. If privately transported copper coins or cash coins without a license are found, they shall be detained in full and reported to the bureau. In addition to the recovery of the supplementary freight charge, all shall be confiscated. If no one claims the goods, they shall be confiscated in full.

<h3 id="e162">Chinese Cotton Mill's Opinions on Revised Import Taxes <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Submitted by the Executive Yuan to the Ministries of Finance and Industry for Verification</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Chinese Cotton Mill Association stated that the sales of Chinese cotton yarn are declining daily. Unless costs are reduced or import taxes on foreign cotton cloth are increased to remedy the situation, it will become increasingly precarious. It has recently been heard that the Ministry of Finance intends to revise import tariffs and has recorded the revisions. The Legislative Yuan will soon review them. Therefore, a special request has been submitted to the Executive Yuan, requesting that the situation of Chinese cotton yarn be carefully considered when revising import tariffs and that cotton cloth import tariffs be appropriately increased to provide relief. The Executive Yuan yesterday ordered the Ministries of Finance and Industry to jointly verify the matter.</p>
<p>Drought Relief Charity Association Investigates Disastrous Conditions in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces</p>
<h3 id="e163">Report from Zhang Jun <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The Drought Relief Charity Association of Various Provinces, having received reports on the disaster situation in various counties from Zhang Lanping, Director of Inspection and Relief in Jiangsu Province, states the following: (1) Letters have been received from Qin Zhujiang and others, town chiefs of Shipu and Sheshan in Jiangning County, stating that disaster victims are suffering from hunger, cold, and starvation, requesting methods of relief. Deputy Director Li Tianzhen has been instructed to go to the area to investigate the veracity of the reported disaster situation. Further measures will be proposed and reported upon receipt of his reply. (2) A large letter has been received, along with a letter from the Wujin County Disaster Relief Committee appealing for emergency relief in the disaster area and a list of the drought situation. Having read them all, it is confirmed that relief is necessary. However, the disaster area is so vast, the number of disaster victims is so large, and the disaster situation is so dire that the Association cannot handle it independently. Concrete measures by the county or joint cooperation with other charitable organizations are necessary for the Association to conduct inspection and relief. (3) In the eighth and ninth districts of Jiangdu, in addition to the report from representative Wang Shaohe, Lanping also sent people for secret investigation. It is estimated that there are more than 120,000 disaster victims. The poorest account for 70-80% of the population. There are tragic cases of children being drowned and couples committing suicide. However, the county must have its own plan before the Association can proceed. Otherwise, with severe disaster and meager funds, we dare not act rashly. (4) Zheng Shouchang, Executive Director of Lishui County, telegraphed that disaster victims in various townships of the county have exhausted all livestock and are surviving by collecting aquatic plants from the river. Deaths are seen daily. It is difficult to fully describe the misery. The previously allocated relief funds are insufficient for distribution, requesting that the conference increase the amount. Lanping intends to wait until they have reached a certain stage before determining how much to allocate. The Director of Inspection and Relief of the Association must investigate the actual situation of disaster relief in various counties and begin to plan. Although it is difficult to provide comprehensive relief with great disaster and meager funds, we must uphold our conscience, do our best, adhere to the principle of saving the dying but not the poor, strictly investigate and implement relief, save one person and save one life, and ensure that relief funds are not wasted.</p>

<p>The Urgent Relief Donation Association, in order to promote the donation of universal donations by people from all walks of life, specially entrusted various banks, newspapers, money shops, companies, stores, taverns, and car dealerships to collect universal donations. The original deadline was the end of January. Later, due to telegrams from various places stating that the disaster situation was extremely severe, requesting more donations for relief, the association sent letters to various newspapers, banks, money shops, etc., extending the deadline and working hard to handle the matter. The donations received were submitted to the association at the end of the previous month for the second phase of settlement. A few have not yet been submitted. It is reported that the association has sent separate letters urging them to submit all the donations received as soon as possible to the association for allocation to various places for relief.

<h3 id="e166">Lawyers Association Asks Court to Pay Attention to the Dignity of the Court <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Not Just Because of the Ke Yinghao Case</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association sent another letter to the Shanghai First Special District Court regarding the Ke Yinghao case, in which he shouted in court and insulted lawyer Zhu Sifu, a member of the association. The letter stated: According to the letter from member Zhu Sifu, regarding the case in which member representative Liu Yide's rental office sued Min Ke Yinghao, who lived at No. 5, Ping Le Lane, Xizang Road, for owing more than 1,000 yuan in rent, when the judge of the First Special Court, Luo Chongtai, convened a hearing in the Civil Court No. 7 on December 10, the member representative and the party concerned appeared in court, and Ke Yinghao also appeared in court. He stated that he was from Shanghang County, Fujian Province, and that in the eighth year of the Republic, Ji, stationed in Japan, applied to the Ministry of Interior to renounce his nationality. In the ninth year of the Republic, he formally became a Japanese national and was therefore not subject to the jurisdiction of the national court. At the same time, he submitted a certificate of Japanese citizenship as proof. At that time, the member argued that, according to Article 11 of the Nationality Law, the renunciation of nationality by a person must have a certificate of renunciation of nationality from the Ministry of Interior of the country in order to be valid. Ke Yinghao only submitted a certificate of citizenship, which cannot be recognized as Japanese nationality under the law. Unexpectedly, at this time, Ke Yinghao stepped down from the defendant's seat in the courtroom and strode in front of the judge. Although the judge stopped him, it was ineffective. He even vented his anger on the member, raised his fist to strike the member. Fortunately, the bailiff stopped him, avoiding abuse. However, Ke cursed the member in Mandarin, saying that he had to beat him. His voice was loud and menacing. Judge Luo then adjourned the case to investigate his nationality with the Ministry of Interior and left the court. Ke was still unwilling and waited outside the courtroom, wanting to get the member and be satisfied. After being informed, the member declared this situation to the court at that time, and in order to avoid his violence, he had to temporarily avoid it in the court. After a long time, Ke left the court. This is the situation at the time. A lawyer only knows to handle litigation on behalf of the party concerned according to law. If the defendant has any defense, he can make a proper statement to the court in accordance with legal principles, and cannot vent his anger on the lawyer. Now Ke Yinghao relied on his Japanese nationality and dared to act arbitrarily in the dignified court, and even wanted to beat the member in court. After leaving the court, he waited outside the door for a long time. Checking the order of the court, people of all nationalities should strictly abide by it. If there is any violation, the judge can take him into custody and send him to the consulate of the country for investigation. Moreover, it is not yet possible to prove whether Ke Yinghao has actually become a Japanese national before the Ministry of Interior has replied. He dared to be so violent. If he is formally a Japanese national, I don't know how tyrannical he will be. Ke Yinghao's behavior not only insulted the members, but also damaged the prestige of the Chinese court. Insulting members is a trivial matter, disregarding the solemnity of the national court is a major event. If he is not severely punished, this kind of event will follow one after another. I have to report urgently. For this reason, I especially ask Jun Hui to forward it to the Procuratorate of the First Special District Court, quickly investigate and detain Ke Yinghao. If the Ministry of Interior replies in the future and proves that he has indeed renounced his nationality, he will be sent to the Japanese consulate for punishment. If it is found that he is not Japanese, he will be severely punished according to the law to warn the violent and respect the law. According to the previous time, the association had detailed the facts of Zhu's member being insulted by Ke Yinghao in court, and sent a letter to Junyuan for correction. Nai Du Junyuan believed that it was based on hearsay and did not conform to the facts. It also stated that maintaining the dignity of the court, Junyuan was more concerned than any other party. No matter what country the offender was, the presiding judge had already dealt with him according to the law, without waiting for him to take any further illegal actions before correcting him. Today, the statement made by Zhu's association seems to be not much different from the rumors in the newspaper. The association deeply feels that the presiding judge at the time had not fulfilled his duty to handle the case according to law, and it is difficult to guarantee that the same kind of event will not happen in the future. There is still a need to request correction. It was discussed and decided at the 188th joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committee of the Association that another letter should be sent to the Shanghai First Special District Court for correction. It should be noted that maintaining the dignity of the court is the authority of Junyuan, and the association does not need to make a vain request. However, Fayuan is the place where Chinese and foreigners watch, and in the past year, there have been occasional deviations in the solemn place of the court, such as the gathering of hooligans in the Ji Buddha case, shouting slogans, and the member Cai Yicheng of the Samsung Yarn Factory being openly thrown feces. The association regards all these things as extremely regrettable. Therefore, dare to state its stupidity and use it for fodder. I want Junyuan to be humble and will not consider it a third violation. Shanghai First Special District Court, Shen Junru, Chen Tingrui, Wang Weizhen, Standing Committee Members of the Shanghai Lawyers Association, respectfully.</p>

<h3 id="e168">Shanghai Municipal Council Changes Employment Method for Foreign Staff <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Focus on Local Recruitment</p>
<p>In Order to Save Expenses</p>
<p>Since 1931, the Municipal Council has changed its employment of staff to a letter of appointment. There are two types of appointment letters: A, meaning recruited from abroad, and L, meaning recruited locally. Staff with the L designation do not have the right to a half-year leave after five years, nor do they have travel expenses for employment or departure. In recent years, there have been as many as 140 foreign staff employed with the L designation, saving the bureau a lot of expenses. In special circumstances, L-designated staff may be changed to A, but this has not yet been implemented. The Chief of Finance has recently drafted several measures to achieve a uniform intention in thrift. The main points of the measures are as follows: 1. In the future, all foreign staff, regardless of where they are recruited, will be L-designated staff and must serve for at least five years. 2. If the service period is long, or the position has a specialized nature, or it is permanently needed, the staff member may be allowed to change to A-designated treatment. 3. Experts holding special positions are not subject to the restrictions of Article 1. 4. Those recruited from abroad or those recruited as British military personnel to serve in the police department will receive the same treatment as those who hold positions in other departments, but these personnel will receive the benefit of exchange rate preferences when they are dismissed. 5. Japanese and Indian personnel will be handled in accordance with the new regulations. These measures have been agreed to by the heads of various departments and have been submitted to the Board of Directors through the Appointments Committee. The Board of Directors has adopted them in principle on the 7th of this month. As for what kind of positions will be treated as A-designated in the future, it will be determined again.</p>

<p>Moore Memorial Church is the most magnificent church in Shanghai. The pulpit is semicircular with three tiers, each adorned with cypress leaves and filled with flower baskets presented by various circles. The flowers bloomed, resembling a flower array. There were no less than one hundred and ten baskets in total. The ones sent by Feng Yuxiang and Mei Lanfang were particularly eye-catching. The highest point was the place for musical performances. The religious atmosphere blended with the fragrance of flowers, making the hall feel even more sublime and sweet.</p>

<p>Yesterday at 2:30 PM, Mr. Xiong arrived at the church before the bride and sat in the first seat in the first row of the audience. He wore a blue robe and black mandarin jacket. His hair had been meticulously groomed, and he greeted the arriving guests warmly with handshakes. He radiated happiness and energy, looking no older than forty. At 3 PM sharp, the bride, Ms. Mao, arrived gracefully with her bridesmaids. The bride wore a tiara, a white veil, a white satin dress, and silver-gray high heels. She was fashionably dressed, wearing gold-rimmed glasses and light makeup, displaying unmatched elegance. As the church organ played, the ceremony began.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Simple and Solemn Ceremony <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>The ceremony began at 3:10 PM. The officiating pastor, Zhu Baoyuan, stood in front of the pulpit. The bride and groom stood before the altar. The male bridesmaid was Mao Fangmei, the bride's cousin, and the female bridesmaid was Mrs. Zhu Tingqi. After the music ended, the pastor recited a sacred verse. Due to church etiquette, there was no applause or cheering. The couple and the guests listened reverently to the sacred words in a calm and peaceful atmosphere. After the verse, the music resumed. The couple stood facing each other, holding hands. The pastor asked the bride and groom if they were willing to be married. After each stated their willingness and exchanged rings, the ceremony concluded in fifteen minutes. The couple retreated hand-in-hand, and then the guests slowly dispersed. The Christian ceremony was simple and solemn.</p>

<p>After the ceremony, Mr. Xiong accompanied the bride and bridesmaids to rest for a while, awaiting the evening banquet at the New Asia Restaurant on North Sichuan Road. The banquet was held on the ground floor of the New Asia Restaurant, with many congratulatory banners hanging on the walls, featuring witty couplets. Several of the most poignant and humorous couplets are transcribed below. A student named Liu Fuxuan wrote: "Phoenixes fly together, an auspicious omen for the 'Xiong' dream. Zithers and lutes sound in harmony, composing 'Mao' poems." Zheng Hongnian wrote: "Surrounded by children and grandchildren, welcoming a new mother; enjoying the pleasure, watching the old husband." Feng Chen Zhaoyu wrote: "Old classmates become new aunts; old uncles become older brothers-in-law." The ninety-six-year-old Ma Liang wrote: "Blessings arrive late in life, forming a happy couple. Spring arrives earlier than the day, a celestial marriage." Zhang Shizhao wrote: "Seeking a phoenix in the Azure Cave of Several Peaks; leading a phoenix to the Vermilion Mountain of Ten Thousand Miles." He also noted: "Zhang Yu's poem: 'Before which peak is the azure cave? In what year did the phoenix seek its mate here?' In the first month of Yi Hai, Bing Lao and Ms. Mao Yanwen were married at Moore Memorial Church in Shanghai, fulfilling the meaning of this poem. Therefore, I have combined it with a line from Han Yu's poem to create a congratulatory couplet, hoping for the new sounds of young phoenixes and looking forward to the blossoming of flowers. Friends and relatives from home and abroad, let us all listen attentively. Zhao also dares to write these words." Another person, calling himself the seventy-two-year-old Cui Nengyue, wrote a couplet that was particularly well-crafted: "Old husband, sixty-six; new wife, thirty-three; old husband and new wife, ninety-nine. White hair in pairs, rosy cheeks in pairs, white hair and rosy cheeks, eyebrows aligned."</p>

On the walls, besides the couplet by the ninety-six-year-old Ma Xiangbo and the congratulatory poems from Xiong's nephew Zhu Jingnong and others, there were also four paintings of beautiful women by Yun Shouping, titled "Talented Women Writing Books, Beautifully Painting Eyebrows, Playing the Xiao to Attract the Phoenix, Celestial Couple on the Blue Bridge," which were particularly valuable. There were also one or two famous Western paintings. Yesterday at 5 PM, the couple briefly hosted guests at the New Asia Restaurant and then took a night train to Hangzhou to enjoy their honeymoon.</p>

<h3 id="e186">Sanctions for Child Abuse <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Article 286 of the New Criminal Law Provides Explicit Punishment</p>
<p>Child Welfare Organizations Can Also Report to the Prosecutor</p>
<p>In June 1934, the China Child Welfare Association, based on reliable reports, handled the case of Zhang Aizhen, a Shanghai dancer, abusing her six-year-old adopted daughter, Zhang Xiaobao. Although the injuries were verified in court, the judge, based on Article 293 of the Criminal Law, which requires prosecution upon complaint, and after questioning Xiaobao herself, who was too young and ignorant to express a desire to prosecute, ruled that the case was inadmissible and returned the victim to her abuser. The Association believed that this situation was frequently encountered in society. If the judgment was considered inappropriate, then Article 293 of the Criminal Law clearly stipulated that prosecution required a complaint. If the judgment was considered appropriate, what would become of the abused children? Therefore, in July, the Association specifically petitioned the Judicial Yuan to allow domestic child welfare organizations to have the right to prosecute on behalf of children when necessary, so as to remedy the difficulties in the Criminal Law and to impose appropriate sanctions on those who abused children and cunningly played with the law. The Association then received a reply from the Judicial Yuan, stating that since the matter concerned legislation, it had been forwarded to the Criminal Law Review Committee of the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. According to recent news, the China Child Welfare Association received another reply from the Judicial Yuan yesterday (February 9), stating that based on the Criminal Law Review Committee's deliberation, Article 286 of the New Criminal Law already had concrete provisions for punishing child abuse, and there seemed to be no need to enact a separate right to prosecute on behalf of children. Article 286 of the New Criminal Law stipulates: "Anyone who abuses a man or woman under the age of sixteen or uses other methods to hinder their physical development shall be sentenced to imprisonment for up to five years, detention, or a fine of up to five hundred yuan. Anyone who commits the preceding crime with the intent to profit shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than five years and may also be fined up to one thousand yuan." The punishment does not require prosecution upon complaint. The prosecutor can file a public prosecution based on their authority, and all child welfare organizations can report to the prosecutor and request sanctions. In certain circumstances, if there is no one to make a complaint, the prosecutor can designate a person to make a complaint on behalf of the child, according to the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Law. From this, it can be seen that those who abuse children, cripple their limbs, and profit by selling their performances are all criminals in the eyes of the law. Not only can the prosecutor file a public prosecution, but all child welfare organizations can also report to the prosecutor and request legal action. Will they now wake up, repent, and correct their mistakes?</p>
<h3 id="e187">Increase in Capital <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>The company's original capital was four million yuan, but under the 1933 asset and liability items, it reached more than eight million nine hundred thousand yuan, including more than six million two hundred thousand yuan in fixed assets, which exceeded the original capital. Now, due to the development of business, it is urgent to build a new plant, add boiler machinery, and expand equipment. Therefore, in March 1934, the company's shareholders' meeting resolved to increase capital by two million yuan, divided into two hundred thousand shares, still giving the old shareholders priority to subscribe. Every two old shares can be exchanged for one new share. The payment for the shares was collected in one lump sum, from July 16 to December 31, and two million yuan has been fully collected.</p>

<p>Due to the increasing amount of power supplied by the company, the existing power plant's power generation capacity is not sufficient, and the old plant's equipment is not very economical in terms of power generation costs. It is necessary to build a new plant. The plant has now prepared a planning book and main engineering drawings, which have been submitted to the Construction Committee and the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau for review, so that construction can begin and machinery can be added.</p>

<p>Case Concluded and Awaiting Judgment</p>
<p>Cai Xiqing, a native of Taizhou, thirty-three years old, living at Taifeng Lane in Caogadu, West Shanghai, was a foreman at the Taifeng Yarn Factory and had some savings. He married Li and had a son named Wenzhu, who is now seven years old. On December 21st of last year, Wenzhu suddenly disappeared. Cai Xiqing hired people to search everywhere, but there was no trace. Cai Xiqing, deeply attached to his son, posted notices everywhere offering a reward for finding his son. About half a month later, he received a letter stating that his son Wenzhu was now at the Jinwang Temple in Beixinjing. To get his son back, he needed to prepare one hundred yuan in cash and come to redeem him. Otherwise, he would face the consequences. The letter also specified that the person coming to negotiate must wear a blue cloth shirt and tie a white cloth strip around their waist for identification. After receiving the letter, Cai reported it to the responsible police station, which immediately ordered detectives in disguise to go to the location. The kidnappers Gao Lanting, Wang Jiugao, and Chen Guangle were arrested one after another, and the kidnapped child Cai Wenzhu was rescued. They were all taken to the General Bureau and transferred to the local court, where Prosecutor Kong Xianglin interrogated them and prosecuted them for kidnapping and extortion. Yesterday morning, Judge Chen Kangsun specially opened the fifth court for the trial. First, Cai Xiqing recounted the events and requested a heavy sentence. Next, the child Cai Wenzhu, seven years old, testified that Gao Lanting had tricked him and taken him to the second floor of a tailor shop (Chen Guangle's house), where he was not allowed to go downstairs. The child's account was vivid and detailed. The judge then ordered the imprisoned Gao Lanting and others to be brought to the court. Gao testified that he made a living pulling a rickshaw. On December 21st of last year, a friend named Liu Xiguan led a child past his house. He asked him where he was going, and Liu replied that he was going to Longmen Road. He thought that Liu and Cai Xiqing were cousins, so he did not suspect anything. It was not until the next day, when he saw Cai Xiqing posting notices with a reward, that he realized Liu Xiguan had kidnapped Cai Xiqing's son Wenzhu. He said he had been wrongly arrested and asked for mercy. When asked if he had written the letter, he replied that he was illiterate and could not have written the letter. Next, Wang Jiugao, thirty-nine years old, a native of Dongtai, testified that he worked in a yarn factory and lived in Caogadu. When asked what he was doing in Beixinjing, he replied that his cousin lived there and wanted to return to his hometown, so he wanted to entrust him to take ten yuan to his parents for household expenses. When asked if he could write, he replied that he could not. When asked about the child's testimony that he was present, he replied that it was a wrongful accusation. When asked how the child was rescued, he replied that he did not know. Finally, Chen Guangle, thirty years old, a native of Taizhou and a tailor, testified that Cai Xiqing's son Wenzhu had stayed at his house. He said that he went to the Zhang Mansion on Avenue Edward VII to make clothes that day. When he returned in the evening, his wife told him that a friend of hers had brought a child from their hometown to Shanghai to look for his wife, so she had temporarily lodged the child at their house. He thought it was a matter of friendship and did not expect this incident. When asked how old the child was, he replied five or six years old. When asked if he knew Wang Jiugao, he replied that he did not know him. He said he had been a neighbor of Gao Lanting eight years ago, but they had not been in contact recently. At this point, the detective Zhong Xuehuan, who solved the case, testified in court, recounting the process of solving the case. After hearing the testimony, the judge asked Prosecutor Kong to make a statement, followed by the appointed defense attorney Ji Deng Gu Qi to defend the three defendants at length. The judge, believing that the case was clear, declared it closed and scheduled the verdict for 10 AM on the 15th of this month. The three defendants were returned to custody to await the decision.</p>

<p>Boyfriend Also Severely Injured</p>
<p>A Russian woman, Nikolai Aiwa (transliteration), forty-two years old, residing at No. 12, Lane 103, opposite the Second Special Court on Route Pichon, went to the home of a compatriot on the third floor of No. 12, Lane 697, Avenue Joffre, on the evening of the 8th to play cards and drink. At 3 AM, a fire suddenly broke out in a room on the second floor. The Russian woman and her boyfriend, in a panic, jumped from the window. The woman lost her footing and injured her head, dying instantly. The boyfriend also fell from a height and was severely injured. When the fire brigade arrived, the flames had already been extinguished by the occupants. After the police received the report, they dispatched Russian detective Yang Gaoski (transliteration) to investigate. The injured man was sent to the hospital for treatment, and the deceased's body was sent to the autopsy room attached to the Municipal Council Hospital on Route Delastre. Yesterday morning, a report was filed with the Second Special Court, which dispatched Prosecutor Wang Ren and forensic medical officers to the scene. The autopsy confirmed that Nikolai Aiwa died from injuries sustained from the fall. As no family members were found, the court ordered the body to be handed over to the Municipal Council Charity Association for burial.</p>

<p>The home of Shan Botang, a local resident at No. 11, South Liujiachang, Meihua Road in Western Shanghai, was suddenly invaded by six robbers at about 10 PM the night before last. They spoke with a local accent and wore blue cloth shirts and trousers, each wielding an axe or dagger, with one carrying a handgun. The entire Shan family was awakened from their dreams and tied up. Shan resisted slightly and was stabbed in the right thigh. Shan's friend, Zhao Benchang (bookkeeper at Xu Changxing Rice Store in Sijing), was also severely injured in the right waist. It is estimated that more than four hundred yuan in cash and a pair of gold [items] were robbed. After the victim provided a list of lost items, along with an axe and a peaked cap left by the robbers, the report was made to the local police station requesting an investigation. The victims were taken to the hospital for treatment and are fortunately not in serious condition.</p>

<p>House Collapse on Xiamen Road Kills</p>
<h3 id="e193">Confirmed to be a Drug Manufacturing Facility <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Large Quantities of Drug Raw Materials Also Seized on Guangdong Road</p>
<p>Owner is Chen Minghua, Manufacturing for Less Than Two Months</p>
<p>No. 46 Zunde Road, Xiamen Road, Yufeng Company, and No. 48, Xinglong Company, suddenly experienced a huge explosion at about 10 AM the day before yesterday. At the same time, the buildings at those two addresses collapsed and a fire broke out. Firefighters and police officers worked together to extinguish the fire and pulled out two corpses and four injured people from the rubble. The details have already been reported in this newspaper. The case was handled by Zhao Ziren, Chinese Detective Chief of the Old Gate Police Station, and detectives Wang Yifei, He Renrui, Yang Guanying, and Ding Yizhong. The investigation revealed that the houses at No. 46 and 48 were actually a large-scale drug manufacturing facility, organized by Chen Minghua (also known as He Lin) from Wuxi. He rented the two houses in November of last year. The monthly rent for the six upper and lower units was about 470 yuan, guaranteed by the Wufeng Company on Yunnan Road.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Operating Since <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Less than two months. He hired Tang Jiejun from Yangzhou as the accountant, and Wang Yonggui and Wang Yongfu from Tongzhou, Gao Guoqing from Hangzhou, and Fan Wenxi and Ji Jinlong from Sichuan as workers. Inside were two motors and a large quantity of highly toxic substances such as morphine, ether, and alcohol. The incident the other day, according to the investigation, was due to the motor used for manufacturing drugs overheating and catching fire, igniting the ether and causing the explosion. Because the explosive power of ether is very high, the houses collapsed. The workers inside were caught off guard and unable to escape, and were buried under the rubble. Wang Yongfu and Ji Jinlong</p>
<h3 id="e195">Died on the Spot <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Tang Jiejun, Wang Yonggui, Gao Guoqing, and Fan Wenxi were injured. Tang was injured in the mouth, Wang and Fan injured their legs, and Gao injured his chest and waist. Except for Fan, whose injuries were more serious and who was kept at Renji Hospital for treatment, Tang and the other two were taken to the police station by detectives for investigation and detention after receiving treatment at the hospital. At the same time, the detectives received reports from Wang Mao, gatekeeper at No. 139 Zundeli, and Li Yude, gatekeeper at No. 254, stating that on the 15th of last month, they had seen a truck transporting large barrels to those two houses. White powder flowed out of the barrels, causing suspicion. They ordered the street sweeper Ji Asi to follow the truck to see where it was going, but Ji was illiterate. Although he followed it to the location, he did not know the house number, but he knew it</p>
<h3 id="e196">Was on Five Horse Road <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>So he did not pay much attention. The detectives found Ji and had him lead the way. They saw that the house was No. 126 Guangdong Road, and they applied to the First Special District Court for a search warrant No. 2057 and rushed to the scene. There was no one in the house. They seized boxed ether, morphine, and many raw materials for manufacturing heroin. Because time was tight, it was difficult to calculate the total amount. Yesterday morning, the police sent Tang Jiejun, Wang Yonggui, and Gao Guoqing to the Criminal Division 1 of the First Special District Court. Criminal Judge Qian Hongye interrogated them. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated that he was prosecuting the two defendants who were brought to court and Fan Wenxi, who was being treated at the hospital, according to Article 6 of the Anti-Smoking Law. As for the seized items, the total amount has not yet been calculated, and a list will be submitted later after a clear count. As for the items at the scene of the incident, since</p>

<p>Temporarily difficult to calculate, but according to a report from a Western member of the Fire Brigade, there is a risk of further explosions in the fire scene involving Italians and others. Fearing harm to others, they request that your Honor personally investigate. Otherwise, they will be arrested and sent to your esteemed court for immediate destruction. The case still requires investigation, so please allow a postponement. When questioned, Tang Jiejun stated it occurred last November.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Continued Hearing of the Jiande Bank Case <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Chai Chuangui bears heavier responsibility, posts 10,000 yuan bail.</p>
<p>Directors shirk responsibility, unwilling to bear it.</p>
<p>Following the collapse of Jiande Bank, its General Manager Chai Chuangui and all directors and supervisors, a dozen or so people, were criminally prosecuted by creditor Wei Haijiang and others at the First Special District District Court for crimes of fraud, embezzlement, breach of trust, and malpractice. After repeated summonses, as previously reported in this newspaper, yesterday afternoon Judge Liu Yugui continued the hearing. Only six defendants, including Chai Chuangui, appeared, each accompanied by defense lawyers. The other six, Ou Jiancheng, Chen Fuyi, Zheng Huaigu, Chen Xifu, Tu Kaizheng, and Chai Yousheng, were either with unknown addresses, had left Shanghai, or claimed illness, and did not appear in court. First, the lawyers representing plaintiffs Wei Haijiang and Wang Ruyao, Chen Tingrui successively stated how the defendants, including Chai Chuangui, used the lure of hiring them as deputy managers or assistants to fraudulently obtain funds from various individuals for shares and mortgage deeds. Judge Liu then interrogated each of the defendants who appeared in court one by one. Chai Chuangui stated that Jiande Bank was founded in July of the seventeenth year (of the Republic), and he served as director and general manager. In the same year, it was registered with the ministry, and it was not until the twenty-second year that it was approved by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, with a fixed capital of one million yuan and a paid-up capital of 500,000 yuan. The ministry commissioned verification of the capital, and it was certified by the City Chamber of Commerce. There is still a capital book available for verification. On December 8 of last year, due to a lack of cash and poor turnover, bankruptcy was declared, but assets and liabilities could still offset each other. Therefore, if the accounts are completely collected, deposits can be fully repaid. However, in this time of economic depression, collecting debts may not be easy. There are eleven directors on the board of directors. Unless for important matters, everything must be decided and implemented by the board of directors. Ordinary matters are handled by the general manager. Matters such as inviting Wei Haijiang and others to invest, hiring Wei and others as deputy managers and assistants, and mortgaging their deeds were all approved by the board of directors. However, the shares subscribed by Wei were not newly issued but transferred by the previous shareholder, surnamed Zhao, and Taiji, etc. Chai also denied Wei Haijiang's previous court statement that the bank's capital was only about 200,000 yuan. Judge Liu believed that Chai Chuangui bore heavier responsibility in this case and immediately ordered him to post 10,000 yuan in cash or shop as bail. He then instructed the police to take Chai to the bail office to complete the bail procedures to avoid being too late. Next, the defendants Yan Ziyu, Xie Keming, Ma Suizhi, and Li Jingwei, each gave statements. Yan claimed that he was elected as a director but never took office, so he was unaware of all the actions. He paid 2,000 yuan for his shares. Xie claimed that he subscribed for 25 shares, paying 2,500 yuan. Although he was elected as a director, he resigned last October, so he was unaware of the hiring of Wei and others as deputy managers and the mortgaging of deeds. Ma claimed that he always came to Shanghai from Suzhou to attend board meetings, but the investment of Wei and others and the mortgage of deeds were never proposed by the board of directors. Li also claimed that the mortgage and other matters were not approved by the board of directors. At this time, Chai Chuangui was brought back to the court by the police. Judge Liu questioned him about the process of mortgaging the mortgage deeds of Wei Haijiang and others to the Shanghai Bank and the Four Banks Savings Society. Chai claimed that Wei and others sought ways to raise funds to maintain the bank because they saw the financial difficulties of the bank. Wei's lawyer, Lu Jia, then presented a copy of the meeting minutes of December 10 of last year, a resolution of the fifth annual shareholder meeting of December 17 of the twenty-second year (of the Republic), and a statement from the bank's accounting director. Lawyer Lu claimed that the December 10 meeting was convened to discuss the issue of resumption of business. The directors who attended the meeting first signed the meeting minutes and then began the discussion. Regarding the capital issue, Chai Chuangui personally said that only 200,000 yuan had been paid up. The bank's accounting director's statement also said that only 200,000 yuan of capital had been paid up. At the fifth annual shareholders' meeting, Chairman Xie Keming reported on the registration situation to the ministry, stating that 250,000 yuan of share capital had been paid up, which was rejected because 500,000 yuan was required for registration. Therefore, the board of directors had to find a way to raise 500,000 yuan. These three pieces of evidence are sufficient to prove that the defendants Chai Chuangui and others' statement that 500,000 yuan of capital had been paid up is unbelievable. The license issued by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce stated that half of its capital, 500,000 yuan, had been paid up, meaning that its registered capital should be one million yuan. The lawyer wanted to present more evidence, but Judge Liu, seeing that it was getting late and the case was complex and could not be completed in a hurry, ordered the hearing to be adjourned to 2:30 p.m. on February 23 and ordered Chai Chuangui to bring the meeting minutes, capital book, stock stubs, stock payment receipts, and other important documents to the court for verification next time. × × × ×</p>
<p>They were employed there as gatekeepers and accountants. The owner was Chen Minghua. No. 236 Guangdong Road was a warehouse. Wang Yonggui and Gao Guoqing both confessed to being workers, working there for just over a month. Judge Qian verified the confessions and ordered the defendants to be taken back into custody, rescheduling the hearing for one week later. The police requested an on-site inspection, but the inspection was deemed unnecessary. All explosive materials were permitted to be destroyed by the police first, with a detailed list reported. The bodies of Wang Yongfu and Ji Jinlong were inspected by Prosecutor Song from the First Special Court, confirming that Wang was burned to death and Ji was crushed to death. Since no family members came forward, the bodies were ordered to be buried by the Pushan Villa.</p>

<h3 id="e203">Two Lines on Japan by Lin Bosheng <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>...After Reading Xu Daolin's "A Review of Sino-Japanese Relations"...</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>Generally, Chinese people inevitably have two habits regarding the Sino-Japanese issue: one is arrogance, and the other is depression. This is the case among the people, and it is also the case in the government. This is the greatest psychological danger building of today's nation and should be corrected.</p>
<p>Those who commit the first habit clearly know that their strength is insufficient, but they refuse to admit it, only spouting high-sounding words. This approach is not only deceiving others but also deceiving oneself. It must be understood that the Sino-Japanese dispute, with its unresolved grievances, has lasted a full forty years, counting only from the Sino-Japanese War. Even from the September 18th Incident to the present, it has been four years. This situation cannot be resolved by a few empty slogans. Without fundamental planning, grand words are merely pleasant to hear but utterly useless. Moreover, the five-minute enthusiasm vanishes like melting ice and snow. Once the event passes and the situation changes, everything is forgotten, and the air of vanity quickly diminishes! As for those who act impulsively, using foreign affairs as a tool for political struggle, they disregard national difficulties and are beyond consideration.</p>
<p>Those who commit the second habit are just the opposite. They know that military strength is inferior, international standing is inferior, political strength is inferior, and economic strength is inferior. Driven by foreign troubles and weighed down by internal worries, they find it impossible to fight and unable to defend. Exhausted and stumbling, their spirits are withered, and their wills are despondent. They are bewildered and lost, like a lone boat adrift in a dead-end harbor, resigned to fate and letting things drift, never thinking of how to extricate themselves. When discussing Japan, they either weep bitterly and dare not speak, or swallow their anger and are unwilling to speak. The worst of them hold their heads and protect their necks, as if awaiting capture and slaughter, closing their eyes and shaking their heads, like submissive subjects. Although they are not yet dead, their spirits are dead. Although the nation is not yet destroyed, the image of national ruin is deeply ingrained in their hearts. What could be more dangerous and painful than this situation!</p>
<p>After reading Xu Daolin's article "Enemy or Friend?", I most admire that he did not commit these two errors. He frankly pointed out the mistakes on the Chinese side and the mistakes on the Japanese side, and he stated that "the Japanese will ultimately not be our enemies, and we Chinese must ultimately have the necessity of joining hands with Japan," further proposing the path that the two countries should take.</p>
<p>I believe that today, people from both China and Japan should have the same attitude as Mr. Xu, not driven by circumstances, not blinded by emotions, and sincerely, calmly, and rationally seek a fundamental solution to the Sino-Japanese problem. I hope that Mr. Xu's writing can spark a public discussion among Chinese people regarding the Sino-Japanese issue and further attract the attention of the Japanese, prompting them to awaken.</p>
<p>I would like to discuss with Mr. Xu what I personally feel and use it to seek correction from my fellow countrymen.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu's proposed solution to break the Sino-Japanese deadlock involves three points:</p>
<p>(1) On the Chinese side, "As long as Japan has the sincerity to seek a solution, China only needs to demand the abandonment of territorial aggression and the return of the four northeastern provinces. Other methods do not need to be rigidly adhered to. Past pending issues should be resolved with sincerity for mutual benefit, clearing the obstacles to diplomatic relations."</p>
<p>(2) On the Japanese side, "It should earnestly express its sincerity in the statement 'preserving China's unity' and 'not obstructing China's independence or interests and having no intention of harming them' (as stated in the Japanese Foreign Ministry's declaration and Hirota's remarks), resolutely return the four northeastern provinces, making them belong to China's territory, and at the same time resolve the pending issues between the two countries."</p>
<p>(3) "The initiative to break the Sino-Japanese deadlock naturally lies with Japan." Therefore, "This negotiation should naturally be initiated by Japan, but it is acceptable for the two countries to negotiate directly. After reaching an agreement, China will report to the League of Nations..."</p>
<p>How to propose, how to negotiate, and how to report are matters to be discussed after the deadlock is broken, so they will not be addressed for now. The most important thing in Mr. Xu's proposed solution is a prerequisite issue, which I believe needs to be discussed. If this issue is not resolved, then the so-called solution remains unresolved, and the so-called path remains impassable.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Xu's intention, it seems that regarding the responsibility for being enemies or friends between China and Japan, China accounts for 40% and Japan accounts for 60%. In that case, assuming China is willing to be friends with Japan, the extent to which it can be decided is only 40%. If Japan is determined not to be friends with China, the extent to which it can be rejected is 60%. What should be done in this case?</p>
<p>Mr. Xu said: "The one who tied the bell must untie it." The tying and untying of the bell naturally rests entirely with Japan. How should it be untied? Mr. Xu also said: "Japan should take the lead in proposing the return of the four northeastern provinces."</p>
<p>What if Japan does not return the four northeastern provinces? Does Japan's failure to return the four northeastern provinces mean that China will become an enemy of Japan? Before today, Japan has not returned the four northeastern provinces. Should China be an "enemy or friend" to Japan? If Japan does not return the four northeastern provinces after today, should China be an "enemy or friend" to Japan?</p>
<p>If Japan is willing to return the four northeastern provinces voluntarily, that would naturally be the best outcome. But is Japan willing to do so? There are two clear facts before us:</p>
<p>First, Japan's attitude towards the four northeastern provinces is at best to have us recognize Manchukuo, progressing from de facto recognition to formal recognition. From the occupation of the Northeast on September 18th of the 20th year to the League of Nations' resolution not to recognize Manchukuo in the 22nd year, Japan's efforts were aimed at making us recognize Manchukuo. After the League of Nations' resolution, it knew that recognizing Manchukuo was hopeless, so it withdrew from the League of Nations to invalidate the resolution while setting traps in all negotiations, wanting us to fall into the net and make suspicions of de facto recognition of Manchukuo. Later, seeing that the Chinese authorities would not be fooled and even this de facto recognition could not be achieved, it became even more stubborn, simply breaking free from all constraints and tearing up all treaties. The Nine-Power Treaty was abandoned, and the naval treaty was also abolished. Many people ridiculed Japan, saying it was isolating itself. Japan was indeed isolated, but what about China? Since September 18th, we have been hoping for help from other countries, but where are the other countries? We have been hoping for sanctions from the League of Nations, but what sanctions have been imposed? At the very least, the Nine-Power Treaty had some responsibility and effect in safeguarding peace in the Far East, but now even that hope is dashed. Sun Tzu said: "The best policy is to attack the enemy's plans; the next best is to attack his alliances." China is precisely in this situation today. If we say that Japan has isolated itself, the fact is that China is being trapped in isolation. The disparity between an isolated, weak nation and an isolated, strong nation is truly incomparable.</p>
<p>Second, Japan's consistent attitude is to take an inch and then take a mile, with no end in sight. After the Sino-Japanese War, it demanded Taiwan and the Penghu Islands. The Chinese who clung to life thought they could live in peace. After the Russo-Japanese War, it demanded Korea. The Chinese who clung to life thought they could live in peace this time. After the September 18th Incident, it demanded the Northeast, then Rehe. Who knows where it will demand next! It must be understood that occupying the Northeast is merely "a stepping stone for Japan to advance into the mainland," merely a "starting point" for its mainland policy. The ultimate interests of this "advancing into the mainland" for Japan are not discussed here, but until the Japanese awaken, they will definitely use all their strength to implement the mainland policy that they have been pursuing for fifty or sixty years. The Japanese often say: "The mainland is the true mission of the Yamato race," "How can the Yamato race live femininely on a few islands with extremely small area and extremely poor resources?" According to their long-planned plans, they will also relocate the capital with the development of national power, from Tokyo to the southern tip of Korea, from the southern tip of Korea to the banks of the Daedong River, from the banks of the Daedong River to deep into Manchuria and Mongolia. They also want to "take mainland China, Manchuria, Mongolia, and Siberia as the background, embracing the Sea of Japan and the China Sea on the left and right" to grasp the commercial rights of East Asia. They also want to monopolize East Asian industry, from Kyushu (Chikuho coal mining area), the mainland (Tokiwa coal mining area), Korea, Manchuria and Mongolia, and North China. What can we do about it?</p>
<p>The above points, one is Japan's fundamental national policy, and the other is Japan's attitude towards the four northeastern provinces. From the latter, it is still unknown how many opportunities for survival China will have in the future, let alone the Northeast! From the former, even if we don't ask about the future and only care about the present, it is a big question whether Japan is willing to return the four northeastern provinces. Some people believe that the attitudes of the various Japanese parties towards the occupation of the four northeastern provinces are inconsistent. This is true. Before Japan occupied the four northeastern provinces, the opinions of the various Japanese parties differed to some extent. But after they had already seized it, knowing how easy it was, how could they easily give it up? Regarding how to govern Manchukuo and how to annex Manchukuo, although there are differences in the importance and urgency of the methods, they are united as a nation in maintaining their so-called "rights and interests obtained by the blood and bones of the nation." We can say that, given the current situation in Japan, it is futile to hope that any party will be willing to give up the four northeastern provinces. In times of famine and disaster, why dream of eating meat porridge!</p>
<p>Or, we can say, "The Japanese are an Eastern nation and should understand Eastern psychology. The characteristics of Eastern people, especially the Chinese, are that they value emotions, integrity, etiquette, and morality." "To thoroughly renew Sino-Japanese relations, we should abandon force and focus on cultural cooperation, abandon territorial aggression and replace it with mutually beneficial economic cooperation, and abandon attempts at political control and combine with morality and emotion." However, the Japanese have said these words too many times. Aren't the Japanese currently blaming China for being too immoral and too unemotional? Aren't the Japanese talking about Sino-Japanese cultural cooperation and Sino-Japanese economic cooperation all the time? Why is it that these words have not been realized until now? Because the crux of the matter has not been removed and the separation still exists. These words have an effect on people, but they are useless to us. And to remove this crux and break this separation requires endless effort. It cannot be achieved by a few words of morality, emotion, and sweet talk.</p>
<p>We can also say that returning the four northeastern provinces is not without a price. Resolving pending issues is a valuable exchange condition. At this point, I cannot help but recall the situation before and after the September 18th Incident. Before the September 18th Incident, the Japanese demanded the resolution of pending issues. We acted impulsively and neglected the matter, leading to a great mistake, which cannot be denied. But is it still possible to go back to the situation before the September 18th Incident? After the September 18th Incident, we also talked about restoring the original state and starting negotiations, but what was the effect? Wasn't it just one day after another, with the original state never being restored, but negotiations had to proceed?</p>
<p>The so-called first returning the Northeast and then negotiating pending issues, what can we do if Japan does not return the Northeast? Not only that, but even if the Northeast is not returned, and the pending issues are to be negotiated, what can we do then?</p>
<p>Not only that, but even if we go a step further, Japan is willing to consider the Northeast issue, and the so-called negotiating pending issues, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' pocket will inevitably contain the so-called Twenty-One Demands, the so-called Sino-Japanese Treaty, and the so-called Sino-"Manchu" Japanese Defense Alliance. What can we do then? "Enemy or friend?" We are still walking a circular path with no beginning and no end. If we cannot jump out of this circular path, the deadlock between China and Japan will never be broken. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e204">Shanghai Basketball Association A-A Division Final: Pirates Defeat McLins by One Point <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Result: 33 to 32 points</p>
<p>The game was decided by a free throw in the final minute.</p>
<p>Black Hawks vs. McLins tonight at 8:30</p>
<p>Pirates and McLins met last night in the Shanghai Basketball Association A Division game, which was also the final of this year's championship. The two sides were evenly matched, and the game was extremely tense. In the end, each side relied on a free throw to determine the outcome. Carson of the Pirates made the shot, putting them ahead 33 to 32. McLins lost by one point due to Grosky's missed free throw. It was a matter of luck and misfortune. In addition, there were three other games. Among them, the A Division game between Jiangwan and East Asia was also very close. At the end of the game, each side had 33 points. Later, in overtime, East Asia finally won by a difference of four points, 39 to 35, which was unexpected. However, East Asia played very well yesterday, showing considerable progress compared to the past. The results of the other two B1 Division games were as follows: (1) Xia Guang defeated Moore, first half 8 to 7, total result 27 to 12. (2) Seven Team defeated Jianmei, first half 13 to 16, total result 32 to 17.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Pirates Win Against McLins <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>After the start of the game, the Pirates launched a preemptive strike. Smith and Ryan both shot and scored. McLins also scored by Locke. The two sides were in a stalemate for five minutes. The competition was extremely fierce. The Pirates were always in the lead because of their excellent coordination. Locke, McLins' only shooting expert, was closely guarded by Ryan, the Pirates' tall man, and could not display his strengths. As the fierce battle continued to the end of the first half, the Pirates took the lead with 17 to 14.</p>
<p>In the second half, both sides became tense, and the game became increasingly fierce, as it was related to the outcome of the championship. Carson and Squire of the Pirates performed the best, and the entire McLins team also gave their all. Unexpectedly, with only one minute left in the game, McLins tied the score at 32 to 32. At that time, Carson got a free throw and scored another point. Unexpectedly, with seven seconds left, Grosky of McLins also got a free throw opportunity, but unfortunately missed the shot, losing by one point. It was a pity.</p>

<h3 id="e217">Anhui Province Requests an Annual Subsidy of 250,000 Yuan for Educational Funding, Which Was Not Approved <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 9th) The Anhui Provincial Government requested that the government subsidize 250,000 yuan annually for educational funding. The Ministry of Finance replied to the central government that the case of allocating stamp tax funds for subsidies has been decided that starting from November, after verifying the actual reduction situation in each province, the funds will be allocated. There will be no further excuses to delay implementation by offsetting the problem. The request to allocate 250,000 yuan annually from the central government to make up for the shortfall, the central government has already sacrificed the important income of the national treasury, the stamp tax portion, and allocated it to the local government, which is already a reluctant response. At this time of national treasury hardship, there is no spare capacity to make further allocations. Please check accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Cooperation Methods Between the National Academic Work Advisory Office and Various International Organizations <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>The memorandum on the cooperation methods between the National Academic Work Advisory Office of China and various international and national organizations has been published in the newspapers. Now, the cooperation methods between the National Academic Work Advisory Office and various international organizations are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(A) "International Labor Office" The International Labor Office assists the advisory office in providing students under its supervision with the convenience of obtaining specialized knowledge and internships in the country of residence or other countries (attending specialized research institutes, interning in various administrative agencies and enterprises) so that they can be competent in their chosen profession. When the National Academic Work Advisory Office is first established, it seems necessary to hire an advisor familiar with the methods of introducing academic staff from various countries. The term of office is temporarily set at three months. This advisor can be entrusted to the International Labor Office to hire. (B) "International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation" The International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation, at its meeting on July 20, 1934, decided to fully assist the National Academic Work Advisory Office decided by the Chinese government to be established in Nanjing and the West to facilitate the vocational training of Chinese students studying in Europe and the United States to meet the needs of China's current economic construction. The committee decided to organize a small committee with Mr. Hass 郎 Zhiwen, Molede, Pietra Lomach, Shaw Tehui, and Chinese Yuan Tongli as members, whose task is to draft various suggestions and propose methods and nature of various international and national institutions to assist the Chinese advisory office. "The Chinese Academic Work Advisory Office cooperates with an international organization without political or religious nature, such as the International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation, which can dispel the concerns of certain Chinese student groups and arouse the interest of national organizations and governments." The International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation can introduce various organizations (such as universities, schools, Chinese-European university groups, Chinese and foreign associations, etc.) and governments and administrative agencies of various countries to the Chinese Academic Work Advisory Office. Before the establishment of the Chinese Academic Work Advisory Office, the International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation will contact the Chinese and foreign university committees in Europe and the United States. The institute will inform the committees of the plan to establish the advisory office and inquire whether they are willing to actively cooperate with the Western offices of the advisory office. The nature of the assistance given by the Chinese and foreign committees to the Chinese advisory office will be clearly stated later. Regarding this point, the Institute for Cultural Cooperation will also ask the committees to express their opinions. China also does not want the advisory office to hinder the undertakings that the committees have already carried out for Chinese students. The advisory office only asks the committees to also assume the responsibility of supervising students. In places where the permanent representative of China is stationed in the Geneva office, the representative should cooperate closely and liaise with the committee. "The International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation has good contacts with the university offices of various countries, the educational information centers of various countries, the educational administrations of various countries, and the famous figures and academic groups in the academic circles of various countries. If the Chinese Advisory Office needs information and assistance that it cannot obtain by itself, the International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation can provide it in the shortest time."</p>
<p>(C) "International Student Association" Many international student associations have been in contact with Chinese students. The Christian Student Association Federation and the International University Mutual Aid Association have branches in China. The former especially strives to attract Chinese students. In some countries, such as the United States, the organization of Chinese student associations is organized in accordance with the regulations of the International Federation. The International University Mutual Aid Association also convened a conference in Cambridge in 1933 to study and improve the living conditions of Chinese students in Europe. The association cooperates with the International Student Association Federation and the Chinese and foreign committees to organize institutions for receiving Eastern students in various important ports in Europe. Chinese students are, of course, also among the recipients. The Roman Peace Association also does not ignore Chinese students studying in the West. The above associations are very beneficial, especially during the summer, they can introduce cheap summer resorts, organize travel, etc. If a branch of the International Student Association can be organized in China, cooperation with the association will be more convenient.</p>
<p>(D) "Methods of Cooperation with National Organizations in Various Countries" Before the meeting of the Chinese Subcommittee (ie, the International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation organized for the Chinese Academic Work Advisory Office), the following national organizations should be consulted, and if necessary, they should be invited to attend the meeting (including the university committees of Belgium, the United States, France, Britain, and Germany, or the presidents or secretaries-general of advanced research institutes, and the Sino-French Friendship Association, etc.). The International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation should, within the above scope, ask them to assist the Geneva and New York offices of the advisory office, or in an indirect way, that is, to cooperate closely with the permanent representatives of each office stationed there. If there is no such representative, they should cooperate directly with each office. This kind of national organization has the following benefits for Chinese students: (1) It can instruct Chinese students to find accommodation, or provide reduced-price transportation tickets, scholarships, honorary loans, or relief funds for boarding in families, so that Chinese students do not feel difficult in their lives. (2) Find ways to make Chinese students interact with families in their place of residence. (3) Organize language tutoring classes and lectures on common sense. (4) Guide Chinese students' studies, provide information on teaching and research institutions, admission requirements, qualifications, examinations, and special research work. Chinese students' advisors should be people who have sufficient knowledge of Chinese life. (5) Introduce Chinese students to internships in various countries' administrative agencies, factories, and other organizations. (6) Introduce Chinese students to professors and enable them to enter research laboratories to engage in research. (7) Organize Chinese students' holiday life, introduce them to reside in foreign families, open summer special classes, organize academic trips, introduce them to holiday camping youth hostels, etc. (8) Communicate with the Chinese Academic Work Advisory Office.</p>

<h3 id="e225">Experts in Attendance <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>

<h3 id="e226">Meeting Situation <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>The meeting commenced at 9:00 AM. After Mr. Jiang Wenyu delivered a speech outlining the meeting's purpose, Mr. Cai Yuanpei, Mr. Liu Zhanen, Mr. Ou Yuanhuai, and Mr. Yu Qingtang were publicly elected as members of the presidium. The China Stenography Society was responsible for all the records. Mr. Cai Yuanpei gave the opening address, Mr. Jiang Wenyu reported on the Society's activities over the past year, Mr. Jia Foru reported on the situation of the China Vocational School, Mr. Yang Chonggao reported on the general situation of the vocational guidance center's work, Mr. Lu Shu'ang reported on the facilities of the Shanghai suburban improvement area, and Mr. Zhao Aifang and Mr. Liang Zhongyuan reported on the general situation of vocational supplementary schools.

<h3 id="e227">Expressing Opinions <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>After the various reports were completed, experts expressed their opinions. Mr. Liu Zhanen said that to remedy vocational education, (1) the Ministry of Education should be requested to issue a general order to all localities to establish genuine experimental vocational schools; (2) attention should be paid to and promoted for handicrafts education; (3) emphasis should be placed on civic education. Mr. Ou Yuanhuai said that the current call for national revival should not lean towards theory or empty talk. The specific plans of this association are quite practical, and vocational education must have the spirit of national salvation and self-strengthening. Mr. Zhuang Zexuan said that the scope of the Vocational Education Society's activities seems limited to Shanghai alone. In the future, it is hoped that in more distant places, a portion of talent, spirit, and economy can be allocated for experimentation. (4) Mr. Yu Qingtang said that it is more meaningful to conduct vocational education trials in remote areas. Mr. Chen Lijiang said that vocational training should be universal and not limited to a portion of people. Mr. Zhang Yousan said that vocational education encompasses a wide range and should be experimented with separately. Vocational education that is seemingly correct but actually wrong should be overthrown, and genuine vocational education should be promoted, and so on.</p>

It is said that the issue of youth vocational training will be expanded by the Society and popularized throughout the country. The meeting adjourned around 5:00 PM. In the evening, the Society hosted a banquet for the attendees.</p>

<p>The Zhongshan Cultural and Educational Institution on Avenue Foch in this city, due to business development, has completed the construction of the main institution in Beijing. It is scheduled to move to Beijing on the 20th of this month. A reporter from the Shen Shi News obtained the following information from the institution yesterday:</p>
<p>Scheduled Move to Beijing: Since its establishment two years ago, the Zhongshan Cultural and Educational Institution, under the keen management of Chairman Sun Zhesheng and Secretary-General Ma Chaojun, has seen its business develop daily. The original location on Avenue Foch was insufficient, and the lease contract had expired. Therefore, a new site was built last year next to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in the capital, which has now been fully completed and only requires slight renovation. The institution is now scheduled to begin moving on the 20th of this month, and will officially operate in the main institution in Beijing from March 1st.</p>
<p>The Distribution Office: The institution will cease operations for ten days during the move to Beijing in order to gradually transport various books and documents. After the move to Beijing, Chairman Sun Zhesheng is expected to be permanently based at the institution. As for this city, it is planned to set up a distribution office, the location of which has not yet been determined. It was previously planned to build a branch in the city center, but this proposal has now been abandoned.</p>

<h3 id="e233">Meeting of the Board of Directors of the Municipal Education Association <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>

<p>Board of Directors Meeting: Attendees included Huang Zaoxiong, Ma Jiazhen, Zhou Feicheng, Tao Baichuan, Feng Yixian, Chen Jicheng, Wang Longzhang, etc. Zhou Feicheng chaired the meeting, and Li Guangteng recorded the minutes. Matters for discussion: (1) A letter from the Eight District Education Association stated that it intends to establish a children's education center, but due to difficulties in raising funds, requested a monthly subsidy of ten yuan. It was resolved that the association's expenditures had already exceeded the budget, and the request could not be approved. (2) A letter from Junyi Middle School requested that the association forward a request to the Central Gengkuan (Boxer Indemnity) Committee for donations to build a school building. It was resolved that in addition to the association directly forwarding the request to the Central Gengkuan Committee, the request should also be forwarded to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Bureau of Education for consideration. (3) Director Wang Longzhang proposed that the association should also establish a reading club for vocational youth so that young shop assistants or apprentices with aspirations for advancement can further their studies (measures attached). It was resolved and passed, and Tao Baichuan and Wang Longzhang were elected as the director and deputy director, respectively, and the matter was to be handled immediately. The miscellaneous expenses for this item, in addition to the advertising fee for the opening, were limited to five yuan per month. (4) In order to improve the association's affairs, should a joint meeting of the directors and supervisors be held? It was resolved that a joint meeting of the directors and supervisors should be held every two months starting from March of this year. (5) An instruction from the Municipal Bureau of Education stated that according to an order from the Municipal Government, a National Military Education Conference would be convened at 10:00 AM on February 20th. Who should the association send to attend? It was resolved that Standing Director Huang Zaoxiong should be sent to attend.</p>
<p>Setting up a Reading Club: The measures for the vocational youth reading club are as follows: (1) It will be named the Shanghai Municipal Education Association-sponsored Vocational Youth Reading Club (hereinafter referred to as the Reading Club). (2) The Reading Club will be temporarily divided into four groups: politics, economics, law, and Party principles. However, it is currently planned to first establish the politics and Party principles groups, and then gradually expand or add groups after achieving success. (3) Admitted students will be targeted at young shop assistants and apprentices in stores. (4) Each group will enroll 50 students, but classes will not be opened if there are fewer than ten students. (5) Reading time is set at 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM every Friday afternoon. (6) The study period is three months. At the end of the period, those who have not been absent from class for one-fifth of the time, or those who are rewarded by the association with equivalent certificates. (7) The reading method is that the first hour is the lecturer's systematic lecture time. In addition to the students recording and submitting it to the lecturer for review in the future, the China Stenography Society will be requested to take shorthand, and the lecture notes will be mimeographed and distributed to the students. In the future, they will be compiled into a book, which will be used as a series of books from the Municipal Education Association. The second hour is the student discussion time, and the lecturer is responsible for guidance and conclusions. (8) The reading classroom will be borrowed from the convenient Wuben Girls' High School or Minli Girls' High School. If only one class is opened, the public lecture hall of the Minjiao Hall will be borrowed. (9) All matters of the Reading Club will be presided over by one person selected from the directors of this association, or another person from the alternate directors will be selected to assist him. However, at least one director must personally attend each class to take care of it in order to show thoroughness. (10) The list of lecturers for each group will be drafted by the director of the reading club and hired by the association, but no travel expenses will be provided. (11) The start-up costs, in addition to the advertising in the Xinwenbao and Chenbao newspapers for three days when recruiting students, will cost about 30 to 40 yuan, and the cost of printing lecture notes, paper, and tea per month will be about 5 yuan. (12) The Reading Club's curriculum will be jointly formulated by the director, deputy director, and lecturers. (13) It is planned to start advertising for enrollment from March 1st and officially start classes on the 11th. (14) The Reading Club's regulations will be set separately. (15) Whether or not to continue the first phase will be decided by the association.</p>

<h3 id="e234">Pleading for the Disaster Victims <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Dujuan</p>
<p>Our fellow countrymen in the countryside, due to various ravages of natural disasters, war disasters, bandit disasters... are forced to succumb under the hand of death. Those who are fortunate enough to survive have also reached a state of absolute poverty: pawning clothes, selling utensils, selling fields and houses, and even selling their children. They seem to be sinking into the mud, but they are sinking deeper and deeper; the consumption of food, clothing, and shelter has reached a dead end, and these more than five million people are appealing in the north wind!</p>
<p>We who live in the cities are truly blessed. We are neither affected by war nor bandit disasters, and we spend our days in happiness, peace, and tranquility all year round. But, as if we are in heaven, if we just look up and see this serious disaster, these many haggard and starving faces, can we feel at ease?</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "People are not plants or trees; how can they be without feelings?" Moreover, the disaster victims are still our fellow countrymen! How should we rescue them from the fire and water? Although our strength is limited, within the possible scope, we should work hard to raise donations for them, plead for them, and also contribute to the country and the public to fulfill our responsibility as small citizens.</p>
<h3 id="e235">Poincaré <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Jinxi</p>
<p>Poincaré was the President of France. He passed away during the European War. In peacetime, the French people recognized Poincaré as a great patriot and believed that he was a great statesman who could withstand difficulties. When the European War was raging and France's situation was deteriorating, the news of Poincaré's death caused shock and grief among all the French people.</p>
<p>Poincaré was an extreme patriot and an unwavering believer and supporter of nationalism. In his childhood, he witnessed the tyrannical Prussian troops occupying his hometown. His young heart was filled with extreme anger and injustice. This determined his future ambition to be loyal to his country and protect its territory. Later, he wrote in his memoirs: "I cannot see what meaning there is in my existence in this world, unless there is hope for achieving the recovery of the lost land." This shows that he never forgot the cruel impression of the Prussian troops occupying his hometown in his childhood.</p>
<p>I don't hope that all children will become great statesmen like Poincaré in the future, but today Japan has seized our four northeastern provinces. Have children kept the painful and humiliating impression in their memories like Poincaré?</p>

<p>Consume a lot,</p>
<p>Don't let a penny be used,</p>
<p>To buy foreign goods.　　····　····　····　·····</p>

<h3 id="e237">Gunpowder <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Yin</p>
<p>Children... When you set off firecrackers, do you ever think about the question, "How do firecrackers make a crackling sound?" Let me tell you, it's the sound of gunpowder exploding.</p>
<p>Gunpowder is made by mixing saltpeter, charcoal, and sulfur. You can make gunpowder by using 75% saltpeter, 15% charcoal powder, and 10% sulfur. Gunpowder was originally invented in our country. After the research of the Arabs, they invented the use of gunpowder in warfare. Recently, the application of gunpowder in all weapons has been increasing day by day.</p>
<p>When we set off firecrackers, we see a plume of black smoke with a pungent smell. This is black gunpowder. There is also a smokeless gunpowder, which was first discovered as guncotton. The manufacturing method is also very simple. Just soak the cotton in a mixture of nitric acid and sulfuric acid, let the cotton absorb as much nitric acid and sulfuric acid as possible, and after soaking, squeeze out the liquid, rinse with water until there is no sour taste, and then dry it. After drying, it can be used. However, it is very dangerous to manufacture, and cotton is easy to absorb moisture, so chemists have carefully studied and improved it to the smokeless gunpowder used today.</p>
<p>The manufacturing methods of smokeless gunpowder used in various countries are completely different, and the manufacturing methods are strictly kept secret. In China, no one has yet invented and manufactured smokeless gunpowder!</p>
<p>Gunpowder was originally prepared for use in warfare to destroy human lives and destroy buildings, which seems to be a terrible thing. However, it can blow up rocks, and it is indispensable in building roads, tunnels, and mines.</p>
<p>Children! When you play with something, I hope you often investigate its causes, manufacturing methods, and the raw materials used. In this way, it will be of great help to your knowledge!</p>

<h3 id="e239">Where Is the Pig's Tail? <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Qiuxin</p>
<p>This year is the Year of the Pig, so I involuntarily came up with this game of "Where Is the Pig's Tail?" to offer to my dear compatriots as a Chinese New Year gift.</p>
<p>This game is very simple. When children want to play, it is best to invite a few classmates to play together, which will be more interesting. The method is simply to use a large drawing paper, draw a pig without a tail, and paste it on the wall. Then prepare a paper tail and place it nearby. Then, choose one person to come out, give him the tail with a pin inserted on it, then blindfold his eyes with a handkerchief, turn his body a few times (not too much, otherwise dizziness is inevitable), and ask him to connect the tail to the pig. When he relies on his own memory and imagination to connect, it will be laughable; because 99 out of 100 times or all are connected incorrectly. And when connecting, only one hand is allowed. Imagine that he is not allowed to use methods to find out where the pig is, and watch him connect randomly. And after one person connects, the others will follow suit one by one. Isn't that a very interesting game? Moreover, it can also be used as a competition, and whoever connects the tail can be rewarded.</p>

<p>— He Gongchao</p>
<p>Toys during the Sai holiday</p>
<p>Schools have winter vacation, and children will stay at home for more than ten days. If there are no toys to play with during these ten days, it will be so boring. Mr. Science is on stage today, especially to tell children how to make two kinds of toys themselves.</p>
<p>As soon as Mr. Science came on stage, he showed the children an olive in his hand and said:</p>
<p>"Our toys must be made by ourselves. Bought toys are not rare. As long as there are three of these olives, they can be made into very interesting toys." While saying this, Mr. Science took out a small knife and continued: "Use a small knife to shave off half of the olive, leaving the pit; then use two safety matchsticks, sharpen both ends of them, insert a small olive on one end, and then insert the other end on the olive that has been shaved off in the left and right directions: In this way, no matter where you put the tip of the olive pit, it will not fall down. Isn't this very fun?" Mr. Science said and did at the same time. After a while, the toy was made; when he put it on the fingertip, sure enough, no matter how he shook it, it would not fall down. "Why doesn't it fall down? This is due to the effect of the center of gravity. There are a few things we must know about the effect of the center of gravity: (1) The place where an object is placed and supports the object is called the fulcrum (for example, when an ink bottle is placed on the table, the bottom of the bottle is the fulcrum) (2) The larger the fulcrum, the less likely the object is to fall (when the ink bottle is placed on a tree, the bottom of the bottle is large, so it is not easy to fall. If you turn it upside down and the bottleneck becomes the fulcrum, it is easy to fall) (3) The lower the center of gravity, the less likely the object is to fall (when the ink bottle is placed upright, the center of gravity is in the lower part of the bottle, so it is not easy to fall. When it is turned upside down, the center of gravity moves to the upper part, so it is easy to fall) (4) If the center of gravity is outside the fulcrum, the object will definitely fall (when people stand, their feet are the fulcrum. If we lean too far forward or too far backward, then the center of gravity of the whole body will be beyond the fulcrum, and the body will fall) (5) If the center of gravity is below the fulcrum, even if the fulcrum is small, the object will not fall (the olive toy that was just made, the pit tip is the fulcrum, but its center of gravity is in the air below the fulcrum, so it will not fall.) "The tumbler is also made using the principle of the center of gravity. We can also make it ourselves during the winter vacation. First, roll thick paper into a round tube, and glue the ends with paper; the bottom must be glued into a circle, and put a round piece of lead inside the bottom; (glue it firmly with glue) Then add some images according to your own wishes; in this way, this thing will never fall, you press it down, and when you let go, it will stand up again. Because it has lead, the center of gravity of the whole is moved to a very low place, so it will not fall. | | This kind of homemade toy costs very little money, and you can learn some scientific knowledge, which is much more meaningful than buying foreign toys."</p>

<p>(1) The sheep is a ruminant even-toed ungulate in the vertebrate family. Its mouth and eyes are very small, its tail is also very short, it has a mild temperament, likes to live in groups, and eats grass. Its fur is soft, long, dense, and curly, which is good for making fur coats to wear, and can also be used to make wool yarn and wool fabrics. Children, now that the cold weather has arrived, what do you wear to not be afraid of the cold?</p>
<p>(2) The ram is a ruminant even-toed ungulate in the vertebrate family, produced in Spain and Australia. It is an improved sheep breed. It has a pair of curved horns on its head, which look like a spiral, so it is called a ram. They are strong and have fine hair, which can be used to make fur coats, wool yarn, and wool fabrics.</p>
<p>(3) The mouflon is a ruminant even-toed ungulate in the vertebrate family, living on the top of the Alps in Europe. Its horns are more than three feet long and look like bamboo branches. They are also very similar to goats, but they are wild and like to live in groups. They form groups of five to ten or more, led by an old ram. Children, can you be as gregarious and united as they are?</p>
<p>(4) The antelope is a ruminant even-toed ungulate in the vertebrate family. They often live in deep mountains in groups. It looks like a goat and a deer. Its mouth is very pointed, and its four legs are thin and long, which can run fast. It has a pair of short horns on its head and a body length of four feet. Because its horns can be used as medicinal materials and its skin can be used as leather, its skin and horns are very expensive. Children, you only need to go to a pharmacy or leather store to see the shape of their horns and skin!</p>

<p>In a short time, it flew back to the ground. It came down extremely fast. I had lost consciousness for a while. But when it rested on the ground again, I recovered and loosened the knots tied around my body. I was just in time, because its mouth was holding a large snake, and it immediately flew away.</p>
<p>I saw that I was now in a deep valley surrounded by mountains. These mountains were very high. The tops of the mountains were lost in the clouds. There was no way out around, all were steep rocks, so my situation was worse than before.</p>
<p>I walked around the area and saw that the ground was scattered with very good gems, some of which were very large. But what I saw was more than that | Because there were several large snakes in the past, I was very surprised. How big they were, the smallest could eat a large animal in one meal.</p>
<p>They hid in caves all day because they were very afraid of the roc, but they came out at night. I walked up and down in this valley, spending a day. I found a cave and climbed into it at night. I thought I would be safe in the cave.</p>
<p>The entrance of the cave was very small. After I went in, I blocked the gap with a large stone to prevent snakes from entering. I ate something, but was too scared to fall asleep; I heard the hissing of those big snakes all night.</p>
<p>When it was dawn, I walked out of the cave. Only because I was too afraid of snakes, I didn't think about the valuable gems scattered around my feet for a long time.</p>
<p>I didn't have to be afraid of snakes during the day, so I sat down to rest, but I told you earlier that I hadn't closed my eyes all night. Soon I fell asleep. I jumped awake again because I heard something falling near me, making a loud noise. At that time, I saw large pieces of meat being thrown down from the top of the mountain one after another.</p>

<p>Bulls Overpowered by Bears, Further Decline of 2.9 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw a slight decline due to banks continuing to sell off, a major player surnamed Wang persisting in short-selling forward contracts, and supply exceeding demand. However, frequent activity from buyers led to numerous fluctuations throughout the day. Initial morning trading was influenced by the overseas silver market, with London rising and New York remaining stable, resulting in a slight increase in forward silver prices. The market remained strong after closing in the "Big Foot" area (large transactions), with off-exchange pre-market trading around 55.56 yuan. The Central Bank's official rates were announced, showing no change in either British or American currency, and the Customs Gold Unit remained unchanged as well. The standard gold price was 964.5 yuan. Morning opening was still low, but the market stabilized slightly after opening. Later, banks sold British currency and bought American currency aggressively, and Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu also engaged in selling, tightening the domestic market. The major player continued to sell bullion, leading to a gradual decline. It was reported that HSBC's official rates showed the British pound stable and the American dollar depreciating by 0.0625. Buyers took advantage of the low prices to maintain their positions, and even the Dalian trading group came to purchase bullion, gradually pushing prices back up. However, the selling pressure persisted, causing the bulls to struggle. The announcement of the silver equalization tax showed no changes. During this period, transaction volume was low, and the market was hesitant, lingering around the pivotal point, lacking any significant changes for quite some time. Subsequently, the foreign exchange market tightened briefly, boosting buying sentiment and leading to a gradual rise. However, as banks continued to sell when prices rose, the market soon turned downward. Banks, influenced by foreign news reports that the US government would purchase gold, resumed their sales aggressively. The foreign exchange market eased, and the supply in the market exceeded demand, causing many to rush to sell their holdings, leading to another decline. However, public sentiment remained calm, with many maintaining their positions at lower prices. Finally, the market returned to a stable state. Overall, the market remained lackluster in the morning, with narrow fluctuations. The bears displayed remarkable strength, making it difficult for the bulls to compete, ultimately lacking the momentum for a sustained rise. The morning market conditions are recorded as follows:</p>

<p>Market trading was normal, with supply and demand forces balanced. Overall, Ding Kang, Yu Qing Yong, Da De Cheng, Shun Mao, Qing Fa Yong, Heng Yu, Xiang Feng, Sen Chang Yong, Qian Chang Xiang Hong Xing and others were sellers.

The Central Bank's official rates were announced, showing no change in either British or American currency. The Customs Gold Unit remained unchanged as well. After opening, banks sold British currency and bought American currency, a process that tightened the market. HSBC's official rates were announced, showing the British pound stable and the American dollar depreciating by 0.0625. Chinese merchants' sentiment was calm, allowing them to maintain their positions. Although banks were supplying, Chinese merchants were actively buying and selling, gradually stabilizing the market. The announcement of the silver equalization tax showed no changes, remaining at 5.75 percent. The British exchange rate was calculated at 1 shilling and 5.6875 pence. At this time, the situation was uncertain, but Chinese merchants, such as Wang, continued to buy and sell, which tightened the market to a certain extent. However, because banks continued to sell when prices rose, coupled with foreign news that the US government would purchase gold, the market ultimately eased. The noon closing prices for near-term sales were 1 shilling and 5.75 pence for the British pound and 36.125 yuan for the US dollar. Compared with the previous closing price, both the spot British and American exchange rates were level, while the forward rates were slightly stronger. Banks' selling appetite remained strong.

<p>Chip Relationship Between Risers and Fallers</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was slightly weak, but Issue 23 was unique, displaying a different banner. Not only was it not small, but it continued to rise strongly. This shows that the quality of each stock and the amount of chips in circulation are extremely related to the rise and fall of market prices. Buying and selling arbitrarily with the same perspective means secretly losing money, which is not worth it. The large fall of Issue 22 can be compared to the large rise of Issue 23, with a difference of 1.5 yuan. Therefore, one cannot generalize about their ups and downs. The market yesterday still had only half-day, two-session trading. At first, the northern gangs continued to express their appetite, but Issues 43 and 46 had already turned to selling, so the opening of the first session gradually showed signs of weakness. Most of the issues rose more than they fell, with Issue 23 rising by about 0.2 yuan. In the second session, Issues 5, 43, and 54 continued to sell, and there were fewer and fewer incoming orders on the trading floor. Market prices were initially weak and then fell. Short-term gold fell by 0.5 yuan, and Issue 22 fell by as much as 0.6 yuan, while Issue 23 gradually rose from a low price. The market was most eager to buy Issues 4 and 43, with an excellent trend. The market price outlook has no major downside for the time being.

<p>New York Bonds See Upsurge</p>
<p>The Xinfeng Foreign Firm reports that yesterday (8th) the New York stock market was active and prices also rose. This is because the general public continues to be optimistic about Attorney General Cummings's remarks, and at the same time, the ruling in the San Francisco and New York one-to-four-and-a-half gold coin bar case benefited the government, so public sentiment improved considerably. Utility stocks were flat and showed no improvement. The bond market surged under the leadership of US government bonds. Small exchange stocks soared, and the firmness of the market was unprecedented in months. The total daily transaction volume was 590,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left.</p>

<p>The yarn market was flat in the morning and rose in the afternoon because yarn sales venues were still able to maintain operations and Guangdong trading groups in the south were purchasing a great deal. At the same time, some yarn factories were unable to operate as usual due to business difficulties, resulting in a reduction in production. In the afternoon, the Tongzhou trading group once again strengthened its positions, and the market suddenly rose. However, Japanese short positions remained unmoved. According to another source, the amount of yarn stored in Shanghai has increased compared to before.</p>

<p>The opening of the futures market for marked yarn was still flat for each month, so although foreign cotton rose, there were very few buyers in the market. It is said that the spot yarn transaction volume was only about 400 bales. As a result, near-term futures were flat, while far-term futures fell by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. The market suddenly tightened and rose in the afternoon, because trading groups such as Dafu and Tongzhou bought and added to their positions. The Daji trading group No. 19 also came to counter short positions, and the market became tighter and tighter. As a result, each month rose by 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, or 0.9 jiao to 1 yuan. Shenxin Factory has already listed and sold a lot of cotton yarn. It is learned that Dafeng sold 1,350 bales, Jinchang sold 1,150 bales, Changfeng sold 450 bales, Mingde sold 100 bales, Gengfeng sold 600 bales, Ruida sold 450 bales, and Yongchang sold 800 bales.

<p>Spot yarn sales were higher than before. It is estimated that all trading groups bought a total of 1,478 bales throughout the day, with prices slightly higher by 0.5 jiao. The purchase amounts for each trading group are as follows:</p>
<p>Inland 110 Guangdong 940 Ningbo 10 Shantou 55Sichuan 125 Nanjing 10 Yunnan 200 Haizhou 20Fujian 10</p>
<p>The cotton market initially remained flat and then rose, showing signs of firmness again. US cotton rose, but Indian cotton fell. Public sentiment was calm. It was learned in the afternoon that the Tongji Company continued to add to its positions, and the Dafu Tongzhou trading group also bought. The market suddenly turned upward, but manufacturers found it difficult. The demand for raw cotton was not strong. Yuanda sold when the price rose.</p>

<p>The futures market for marked cotton opened with US cotton up by 10 points, but Indian cotton fell by half a Robbie, and gold prices were also flat and weak. The market atmosphere was gloomy and listless. As a result, near-term futures rose by 5 points, and far-term futures were flat. The market suddenly tightened and rose in the afternoon, and the rise was particularly strong, because the Dafu Tongzhou trading group added to its positions. There was also a saying that the Yong'an factory had hundreds of transactions in spot cotton, so short sellers also actively covered their positions, and the market became tighter and tighter. However, Yuanda sold again when the price rose. As a result, each month rose by 0.2 jiao to 0.25 jiao to 0.35 jiao. It is learned that Jinchang sold 3,000 dan, Jifeng sold 800 dan, Yuanda sold 1,000 dan, Dafu sold 900 dan, Hengyi sold 900 dan, Changfeng sold 2,800 dan, Runkang sold 1,100 dan, Yuanxingchang sold 900 dan, Yongchang sold 1,400 dan, and Yongda sold 800 dan.

<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened. Due to unfavorable Liverpool news, March term bulls closed their positions and foreign firms sold, with each month falling by 0.2 to 0.4 points. Then, with the improvement in demand from peers and fewer sellers, it rebounded slightly. Most market transactions involved closing positions while awaiting the gold bar case. Spot demand improved slightly, and the foundation was firmer than before. Since the wheat and stock markets rose, the cotton market was also boosted. By the closing, the amount of bulls closing positions was absorbed by short covering, and the trend was strong. It is estimated that spot goods rose by 10 points, and futures rose by 6 to 11 points. According to news from the New York Cotton Exchange, fertilizer sales in January totaled 232,000 tons in nine provinces excluding Oklahoma, compared to 283,000 tons in the same period last year. Hayes estimated that factory usage this week was 205,000 bales, and Liverpool's cotton reserves were 222,000 bales. The British cotton market was stable, and transactions were peaceful. It is estimated that spot goods rose by one point, and futures rose by one to three points. Indian cotton initially fell due to European exporters selling July and August term White Lohri, but rebounded due to short covering. It is estimated that Pingguo'er remained unchanged, Aomura rose by 0.25 Robbie, and White Lohri fell by 2.5 Robbie. The original telegram is recorded on the left (8th telegram).</p>

<p>Hovering Around the Government Loan Price</p>
<p>New York, 8th, Telegram Report on the Cotton Market This Week: The cotton market was unusually sluggish last week due to the uncertainty surrounding the gold clause case, which limited trading. Market conditions were generally stable due to the lack of selling pressure from the South. Before the Senate Agriculture Committee's hearing, various ways to boost exports were studied. Industry insiders are awaiting further developments. In the Southwest, dry soil and low humidity have delayed cotton planting in some areas, but the cold weather is expected to reduce bollworm populations. Spot prices are stable, hovering around the government loan price. The cotton market is also quiet.</p>

<h3 id="e260">Grain and Flour Prices Decline, Hope for Stability <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw a fluctuating and stable trend in the morning and after-hours sessions. Despite the rise in quoted prices for imported wheat, the market sentiment remained flat after the opening. However, spot prices for imported wheat were quoted 3 to 4 cents higher than the previous day, giving a slightly positive outlook to the prices for various months. In subsequent sessions, although there were fluctuations in the current month, the bulls in the silver market continued to sell, weakening the market. Deferred months stabilized as manufacturers did not sell. Looking ahead, if demand from merchants improves, the situation may stabilize. As a result, the current month fell by 1 cent, March by 0.25 cents, April rose by 0.5 cents, May remained unchanged, June fell by 0.25 cents, and July rose by 1.25 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e261">Imported Wheat Continues to Rise, Domestic Wheat is Sluggish <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market remained stagnant after the opening in the morning. Prices for imported wheat were around 2.25 to 2.30 yuan in Chicago and slightly higher in Canada. Trading in various months was extremely quiet after the opening, with only a few cars of February and March wheat being traded. When the market opened in the afternoon, the market sentiment was slightly positive due to the stability in the flour market and the quote of 4.875 yuan for Australian wheat, which was 3 to 5 cents higher than the previous day. However, the future depends on whether imported wheat continues to stabilize, to avoid repeating the mistakes of previous years. As a result, the current month rose by 4 cents, March by 1 cent, and April by 2 cents. Spot wheat remained sluggish and no transactions were made due to lack of demand from mills.</p>
<p>The Chicago grain market is small, and many long positions have been closed. Those who previously shorted have made some covering purchases. Winter wheat lacks sufficient moisture. There have been some small new purchases in the corn market. Spot prices remain high with no signs of easing. If industrial demand improves, it should boost market sentiment.</p>

<p>Yesterday's market conditions for foreign hsien rice were boosted by the previous day's price surge. However, after merchants from the interior purchased a batch the previous day, they were focusing on picking up and shipping the goods, and felt the prices were too high, intending to temporarily wait and see. Sellers, on the other hand, feeling that the production costs were high and demand was strong, intended to raise prices, resulting in a decline in trading volume. Red rice and brown rice, etc., which had risen excessively the previous day, fell slightly by about 1 cent, and only about 1,500 bags were traded. However, the price of foreign rice remained stable as foreign merchants were optimistic and production costs did not loosen, but trading also contracted. The entire market saw only 5,400 bags of Saigon and Siamese rice traded, as well as 200 tons of road goods. Based on yesterday's situation, the market is expected to fluctuate once more.</p>

<p>Since the major shutdown and business closure this spring, lasting for more than ten days, only three or four companies in the industry have made a profit, while the rest have suffered losses. Six companies are undergoing liquidation, reflecting the poor state of the economy. Last year's river mill inventory was two to three times less than the previous year. This spring's survey shows that the river mill inventory consists of a total of eighty to ninety boats, mostly white japonica rice, followed by inferior rice, with various types being scarce. The inventory in various foreign firms amounts to over 100,000 bags of white japonica, nearly 20,000 of inferior rice, and less than 5,000 bags of customer-specified rice. There are also over 200,000 bags of foreign rice. The industry will resume business on the tenth day of the new year. The market price report for today will be released.</p>

<p>Yesterday's soybean oil and bean cake market saw a slight increase in prices across the board, primarily because the market first stabilized after the previous day's weak performance, then heard reports of rising prices in Dalian, leading to an increase in the exchange's standard prices, which boosted sentiment in the spot market. As for soybean oil, the peanut oil market remained firm, and the bean cake sales were brisk. Merchants from Xiamen and other regions were inquiring, with total trading volume for both current and forward contracts reaching 64,000 to 65,000 catties. Prices rose by 2 cents in the morning and afternoon. Soybean mills also began purchasing, with the mills buying four cars of Yingzhou soybeans at prices ranging from 3.78 to 3.875 yuan, two cars of Mengcheng soybeans at 3.67 yuan, one car of Bengbu soybeans at 3.65 yuan, and over 2,000 bags of Guide soybeans at prices ranging from 3.85 to 3.875 yuan. Merchants from Fuzhou bought over 500 bags of Guide soybeans at 3.90 yuan, merchants from Guangdong continued to buy over 800 bags of Xicheng soybeans at 4.50 yuan and 4.475 yuan. Merchants from Wenzhou and Taizhou, along with merchants from this street, bought over 900 bags of Hankou Zha beans at prices ranging from 3.775 to 3.70 yuan. The remaining transactions were sporadic. The above prices were generally firm, with the exception of Hankou beans, which were slightly softer by 2 to 3 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e265">Sugar Market, Guangdong Coarse White Sugar Slightly Rises <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market trend was flat. The association set the price of Guangdong coarse white sugar at 17.73 yuan, up 3 cents. Number 9 Dutch red sugar was 13.40 yuan, and Taikoo B Mark was 19 yuan, down slightly. The price of the factory's own fine white sugar also eased due to the decline in the price of coarse sugar. Zhenyu Number 1 was 17.40 yuan, Number 2 was 17.30 yuan, Number 3 was 17.15 yuan, and Number 4 was 17 yuan. Zhenji Renzi brand crystal sugar was 22 yuan, Ganzi was 21.90 yuan, and this factory's bagged crystal sugar was 21.50 yuan. Merchants from Guangdong and Chaozhou offered 400 pieces of basket-packed green sugar and 200 cases of sheet-packed green sugar, all priced at 9.60 yuan, and over 100 bags of branch-shaped red sugar at 12.20 yuan, 12 yuan, and 11.80 yuan. It is rumored that a new company is being organized with a capital of 80,000 yuan, which may materialize soon.</p>
<h3 id="e266">Few Sugar Businesses are Profitable <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>Few sugar businesses made a profit after the end of last year's season. It is reported that only five or six companies made significant profits, including Yuanhe with 30,000 yuan, Yantaiheng with 20,000 yuan, Guanghe with 17,000 yuan, Xiehe with 10,000 yuan, Yuansheng with 22,000 yuan, and Hexing with 8,000 yuan. Followed by Heyuan with 4,000 yuan, Maofeng with 5,000 yuan, Baowei with 5,000 yuan, and Shengji with 5,000 yuan. The rest were mostly break-even or loss-making. Hengxing and Maohe have closed this year, and there are still about one or two companies reorganizing. There are no reports of new companies being formed.</p>
<h3 id="e267">North-South Goods, Raw Peanuts Rise by 40-50 Cents <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>Due to the increase in spot prices in the Guangdong and Hong Kong sales regions by 50-60 cents, and low inventories in the production areas, the raw peanut market is very strong. Therefore, the Shanghai market opened with prices rising by varying amounts of 30-50 cents. The previous day, Kaifeng peanuts were offered at 8.30 yuan per 2,000 bags, cocooned peanuts at 8 yuan, Guide peanuts at 7.80 yuan, and Dangshan peanuts at 7.30 yuan. Yesterday, 200 bags of Qinhuangdao peanuts were offered at 8.50 yuan, and this street bought 100 tons of Kaishou peanuts, with merchants from Guangdong purchasing them at 8.40 yuan. Lower-grade Dangshan peanuts were also needed at over 7.00 yuan, and further developments are being watched.</p>
<p>The first batch of daylily was offered at over 100 bags, top-grade at 23.50 yuan, Daxing at 22 yuan, Yanghuaguo at 21.50 yuan, and township daylily at 29.50 yuan. Over 40 pieces of Sichuan fungus were offered at 104 yuan. Hankou original package fungus leaves were priced the same. Yichang fungus was at 90 yuan. The opening price of black melon seeds remained stable. Dangshan seeds and Da Jinbian seeds were both at 9 yuan, and Mingguang seeds were at 7 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e268">Hardware, Black Iron Sheet Seems Strong but is Weak <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>The recently announced price by the Black Iron Sheet Association is estimated at 10.025 yuan per dan, while thick colored sheets are priced at 9.50 yuan, each being 50 cents to 1 yuan higher than at the end of last year. However, in the past two days, the buying side has been observing, resulting in limited transactions. Those holding inventory are showing signs of loosening due to the high prices, so the situation appears strong but is weak. It seems that the price per dan may fall by 20-30 cents. The association only issued 30-40 dan, which were all factory-related transactions. Due to the high prices, there were few bulk purchases.</p>
<h3 id="e269">A Significant Amount of Eastern Goods and Hardware is Being Procured <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the Eastern exchange rate has weakened significantly, with 100 yuan being worth about 127 yuan. As a result, local companies have a strong interest in purchasing Eastern goods. Over the past two or three days, it has been reported that a large quantity of Eastern hardware has been transacted, including 2,000 bundles of new lead wire, 30,000 to 40,000 sheets of Eastern galvanized iron, over 1,000 bundles of garden lead wire, and a considerable amount of other copper sheets and copper wire.</p>

<p>The silk market remains dull. Although the telegrams received yesterday showed that overseas silk prices had risen compared to yesterday (the US market price today is 1.36 yuan), the exchange rate has also risen, which is still far from the Shanghai silk price. Furthermore, manufacturers remain firm in their intentions, so there are no transactions. There is also no market for domestic users.</p>
<h3 id="e271">Piece Goods and Woolen Fabrics Industry, Few Profits <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>The woolen fabrics industry in the 23rd year appeared strong but was weak, with apparent profits but many unpaid accounts. It was inevitable that payment to the firms would be difficult from time to time. Among the companies with the largest turnover in the industry throughout the year, Chunhe, Yonghua, Xinxinfenghua, Huafu, and Yikang were among the top five. Only Yikang and Lianxing had profits of over 20,000 yuan, and Yichangtai, Chunhe, Yonghua, Huafu, Xinchang, Chengda, and five others had profits of over 10,000 yuan. Xinfeng, Hefenghua, Kangda, Lunmei, Lunhong, Xiangyu, Kangan, Hejinfeng, Zhaoji, Jiufeng, Wangxingchang, Yuchangxiang, Wangshuntai, and thirteen other companies had profits of three to five thousand. Mouji, Mouda, Mouxin, Mouxing, and four or five other companies had losses. In summary, out of over forty companies in the woolen fabrics industry, in addition to the twenty mentioned above with profits and the four or five with losses, most of the other twenty companies broke even.</p>
<h3 id="e272">Sundries, Domestic Cowhide Suddenly Rises by Ten Yuan <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>Cowhide demand has mainly relied on imports from Rangoon. In recent years, due to increased tariffs, imports have decreased significantly, leading to the rise of domestically produced Qiongzhou Shajiang red leather as a substitute. Moreover, its color and luster are even better than red goods, so it is used as a substitute in various sales regions. Due to the sharp contraction of Guangdong exchange rates at the end of last year, the source of supply decreased, and the trend became tight. The opening market was enthusiastic, with the price suddenly rising by ten yuan. Shajiang red leather opened at 65 yuan, and water red leather at 45 yuan. Other white back leather and water stiff leather have not risen or fallen because they are not currently in the sales season.</p>

<p>First Anniversary of the Women's Garden</p>
<h3 id="e290">A Small Hope <a href="#e290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— Cai Muhui</p>
<p>I can't remember if it was "Rebirth Fate," "Brush Generates Flowers," "Heavenly Rain of Flowers," or some other "·········." When that author was writing a certain section, she put down her pen for a long time because she had to do chores for the New Year. When she picked up her pen again, it was already after the Lantern Festival, so she inserted her own family life into the novel. In the eyes of a literary critic with strong traditional ideas, this might be said to be inconsistent with the methods of novel writing and absolutely should not have happened. But to me, who values life more than literature, it left an extremely deep impression. Now, it may have been a full twenty years since I read that novel. The story in the novel is almost completely forgotten, but the author's digression is still very vivid and clear. This is probably because women's lives have always been recorded only in abstract, commentary-style, or fictionalized essays or novels. There are very few sketches in the style of everyday talk. Although this kind of sketch is too simple in the eyes of some people, those who pay attention to real life feel that it is more valuable than any other kind of article.</p>
<p>This year, except for a few Sunday mornings when special events occupied my attention, I have seen almost every issue of the Women's Garden. Sometimes I see a lot of beautiful and delicious exotic flowers, which makes me reluctant to put them down. Sometimes I only see a few simple and haggard ordinary blades of grass, which also makes me watch them back and forth. I feel that my state of mind is like Tennyson's (Tennyson) appreciation of the green grass growing in the cracks of the prison wall, feeling that carefully looking at that simple blade of grass can penetrate the highest philosophy of the universe. The reason is that a real blade of grass can make people understand the truth of life better than a fake flower. A plain photo of an old friend who can resonate with one's own life is more valuable to watch carefully than a beautiful artistic photo of a peach blossom or a star. In the past year of this magazine, although I liked several kinds of magazines very much, the one I read most diligently was the Women's Garden, and it was for this reason.</p>
<p>However, I have further expectations for the future of the Women's Garden. First, I hope that the gardeners' characters will be more diverse and rich. In addition to exploring and recording the lives and paths of educated women, I also pay more attention to the masses of women living in factories and fields. If the people living these lives can take on the responsibility of introducing themselves, it would naturally be even more interesting. Second, I hope that the flowers in the garden will grow more freely, whether it is "A-da crying for peanut rice, A-er crying for shit, A-da's father moaning for boiled water, and A-da's mother is busy writing an article for the Women's Garden or other publications" or "Manager's tricks and Mrs. Manager's suspicions," both sides of women's lives can be written in a very real and unrestrained way. Don't be too conservative and gentlemanly. Writing articles too formally and elegantly, too like a serious matter, will lose the true flavor.</p>
<p>Because there are more and more publications that solve problems and pass the time for women in the knowledge class and the leisure class, those sisters who are groaning under the double burden of housework and work not only do not have the time to do the detailed work of biting words and phrases, arranging layouts, and practicing writing, but also do not have the time to sit quietly and appreciate the literary talent that is irrelevant to life!</p>
<p>I really admire the female writer who gave me such a real impression twenty years ago. She made me realize that even a vulgar person who has no time to appreciate flowers and the moon can write a few sentences. Otherwise, perhaps even now, I would still be superstitious that only those who live like angels, untouched by the mundane world, are worthy of playing with words.</p>
<p>In order to help celebrate the first anniversary of the Women's Garden, I have hastily drafted these few words in the midst of my busy schedule. Perhaps only busy people will agree with my proposition.</p>
<h3 id="e291">Women's Issues in the Past Year <a href="#e291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— Bi Yao</p>
<p>The new calendar is now mid-February, but the old calendar is still the beginning of the new year. The old always has its ancient fragrance in people's minds, so the women's issues floating in the ancient country for a year are also settled at the end of the old calendar, according to the merchant's method. Last year had a leap fifth month. In the thirteen months of the year, the following events happened in the women's sector, neither light nor heavy:</p>
<p>The first blow was the "Women's National Goods Year." National affairs have been like a mess this year. From the mess, a clue to save the country was picked out, that is, women's use of national goods. However, those who spoke earnestly were ignored by those who listened; after half a year of implementation, there was a report of 600,000 in lace consumption and 850,000 in imports of powder and perfume. As a result, social figures were greatly shocked. They thought that if women were so unwilling to work hard, the only chance to save the country would be cut off. Therefore, women's strange clothes and glamorous outfits became the target of public criticism; all parts of the North and South took the ban on women's dress as their business. Beiping still believed in the old royal style, calm and generous, only prohibiting women from bare feet and bare legs. Guangdong further demonstrated the enterprising spirit of the maritime country, and went on to prohibit men and women from bathing together, even living together, eating together, and walking together. Storms and rains made a lot of noise in all directions. Then a fundamental solution was produced, returning to the source, calling them back to the family; in this way, not only would they have fewer opportunities for glamorous outfits, but also less ability to do so. Thus, the ancient doctrine of virtuous wives and good mothers was revived. Under this atmosphere, many girls' schools that used to be called for cultivating social talents were trying to run education for virtuous wives and good mothers. Although a few people were discussing "What about Nora after she leaves?", the situation clearly told us, "Call her back home!"</p>
<p>Everyone paid attention to the home, and the problem of family safety and social morality arose, and then there was a very long tail. From banning women's decorations, distinguishing the badges of song girls, and detaining prostitutes who solicit customers, to the solemn formulation of provisions for punishing married women for adultery by the Legislative Yuan, the highest tide was set off. At that time, many women's organizations were organized in Beijing, Shanghai and other places, striving for equal laws. In dozens of days, they ran around calling out, and finally the one-sided criminal law of punishing "married women who commit adultery with others" was revised to "those who have a spouse and commit adultery with others shall be sentenced to imprisonment for less than one year." Women, who had been silent for a long time and allowed others to slander them, won the victory in terms of regulations.</p>
<p>How about women who have obtained equal rights in criminal law in other aspects? Let's not talk about the common practice of selling wives and daughters in the lower classes; let's just say that in the upper classes, where there is more freedom and less shackles, two major events have occurred in the last few days of the year. One is that Ms. Wei Wenxiu, the concubine of the late President Li Yuanhong, remarried to businessman Wang Kuixuan, which aroused criticism from Li's relatives and even more condemnation from Hubei fellow villagers, and finally led to her being deported by the Qingdao government. The other is that Sha, the concubine of Lu Dipin, the former chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, who died in Beijing, fell from the building and martyred herself. Ms. Wei lived in a land of ritual and righteousness. At a time when Guangdong and southern China were holding "widows' banquets," she destroyed her chastity and remarried, which aroused public outrage (?) which is a pity; Ms. Sha lived in the last days, but she was able to die for her husband, and social figures should silently pay their respects. These two events, one humiliating and one glorious, played the finale of the Jiaxu Year of Women.</p>
<p>In general, the so-called women's issues in the past year are very different from those in the Northern Expedition period. At that time, women were in dire straits, and the focus of the problem was on arousing them to liberate themselves from the shackles of thought and habit; how to seize jobs and seize economic rights; how to fight against oppressors and imperialists. They looked at the old ideas, systems, powers, and everything with contempt and boldness. However, this kind of typical woman was not needed last year. The women needed last year were quiet, chaste, virtuous, dignified and docile. Their value lies not in their own abilities and contributions to society, but in the images they reflect in the eyes of the objective. Therefore, the focus is on their clothing materials, the size of their clothes, their hair, their leather shoes, their chastity, their...... If the women encouraged during the Northern Expedition are compared to lionesses, then the women required last year can be compared to sheep. The former is suitable for charging into battle in a thorny jungle, while the latter is suitable for leisurely wandering in a mulberry garden and grass path. The changes of the times are reflected in women with such differences!</p>
<p>The old accounts of women's issues last year are roughly concluded in this way. Are there some people who think they are satisfied, or some people who think they are disappointed?</p>
<h3 id="e292">Women's Garden First Anniversary <a href="#e292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Ordinary women are already struggling under double oppression. China is a semi-colonial country, and Chinese women are living under triple oppression! It is easy to imagine the imperfections of a garden born under such circumstances.</p>
<p>The garden we initially acquired was not only laden with ice and snow, but also strewn with rubble. How could we plant good seeds? Yet, we have finally bravely cultivated it for a year. Though the tender shoots growing under the flagstones are inevitably crooked and weak, we are neither pessimistic nor sentimental. We irrigate and cultivate as much as possible. After a year of arduous management, we cannot speak of achievements or harvests. However, in this stagnant atmosphere, one can hear one or two sluggish sounds of hoes, and on that desolate wasteland, it seems that some tender shoots and green leaves can already be seen. Though the sprouts are crooked, they are born deficient; but as long as they are not imbalanced or unduly ravaged later on, it is not difficult to hope that they will grow into a lush forest. With this hope, we would like to give a brief report on the work of the past year, firstly to fulfill the obligation of accounting, and secondly to review the past and look forward to the future. The following is a brief report of our work:</p>
<p>(1) In view of the past stagnation of the "Women's Movement," we have called for a re-stirring of the "back wave." We anticipate that the "back wave" of 1935 will be greater than last year's ripples;</p>
<p>(2) With the undertow of the revolutionary tide, the "Nora" who had already left are returning home one by one. When the slogan "Women are Returning Home" reached our East Asian continent, there was a great debate in our garden. The conclusion was that not only the new women of the future new China should not be kitchen maids, homebound slaves, or men's playthings, but even the women of this transitional era must strive to be "social beings."</p>
<p>(3) In the past year, women's clothing and grooming seem to have received special attention. However, ordinary lower-class women are merely seeking survival on the borderline between life and death, and cannot afford to talk about how to groom or dress. Their lives are perhaps not experienced or understood by ordinary people; therefore, we often use a corner of the garden to reveal sketches of their lives. It is a pity that statistics are lacking, and we are further limited by the environment, making it inconvenient to be explicit.</p>
<p>(4) We strive to eradicate the enslaving mold of "Three Obediences and Four Virtues" and the feudal remnants of "remaining faithful to one husband until death," and strictly prevent the tender shoots and green leaves from being needlessly damaged.</p>
<p>(5) The words of the great thinkers of the world are the trends and perspectives of the times. Their opinions on women's issues are precisely the reference materials for our planting. In addition, biographies of famous people can serve as our lessons. We have already published quite a few in the past, and hope to continue to do so in the future.</p>
<p>(6) The most important issue among women's issues is the issue of childcare. We have published a special issue on this topic. There have been many discussions on public childcare, and it is believed that nurseries are already a necessary item in modern society.</p>
<p>(7) We published a special issue, among which "My Ideal Future Life" was the most interesting. The results of the call for submissions showed that although there were many who were ignorant, there were also many who were clear-headed, which is quite optimistic.</p>
<p>(8) The movement to fight for laws started in Nanjing and continued in various places. We waved the flag to support the cause in our garden in the rear, and at the same time, we hope to use the spirit of fighting for laws to promote the fundamental oppression.</p>
<p>(9) Since the "May Fourth" Movement, the emergence of intellectual women on the social stage has been the most noticeable, especially the various writers and their works. Now, we are re-evaluating their works correctly, not only to give the authors 丨丨the living and the theory丨丨to self-examine, but also to benefit the readers infinitely. We still hope that various critics will contribute more articles in the future.</p>
<p>(10) In order to regulate the boring hard text, we try to insert some soft writing and common sense in each issue as much as possible.</p>
<p>The above are the points that we think are particularly worth mentioning. As for the detailed work, we can only omit it.</p>
<p>The past work and expectations are as mentioned above. In the future, in addition to continuing to work hard and strive to publish, we would also like to announce the work that we want to add in the near future:</p>
<p>(1) Restore "Reader Correspondence" to do some practical guidance work. We have also hired a lawyer as a legal consultant. Readers can write to inquire. We will try our best to reply.</p>
<p>(2) Introduce more beneficial books and newspapers that should be read, hoping that it will become a beacon in the garden, so as to avoid those who seek knowledge from groping in the dark.</p>
<p>(3) Open a special lecture on women's issues, using the most simple language to give a simple and systematic talk on women's issues. So that everyone knows why women's issues have become a problem, and the future trends.</p>
<p>(4) Publish more sketches of the real lives of women at home and abroad.</p>
<p>(5) Collect news about women's movements at home and abroad. Enrich the garden's knowledge.</p>
<p>In the past year, although we have asked ourselves to work bravely, we have been limited by our abilities and forced by the environment, so that it cannot become a perfect garden. We also hope that readers will work together to cultivate it, so that this small garden can become more prosperous and grow!</p>
<h3 id="e293">A Tragedy of 1934: Rural Bankruptcy and Rural Women <a href="#e293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>— Junhui</p>
<p>"Rural bankruptcy!" This is the terrible cry of grief and sorrow of the people across the country! It is also the most cruel social tragedy staged by countless peasants! The expansion and deepening of this tragedy has become a matter of life and death for the entire nation. No matter how much people like to gloss over the truth or praise the status quo, they cannot deny that this tragedy is constantly being performed all over the country! And in this shocking tragedy, rural women are the characters that occupy the main position!</p>
<p>This tragedy began to be played when the commodity economy of imperialism broke through the Great Wall and invaded the Chinese countryside. Up to now, the plot has become more and more tense! Therefore, the audience in the audience, of course, want to sigh, and even the writers and directors of this tragedy, also want to promote some relief, some revival! But all this is nothing more than a farce to cover up this cruel fact! But this extremely tense tragic scene cannot be eased in any way!</p>
<p>Especially in the past year, the bankruptcy of the rural economy, trapped by the unprecedented interaction of floods and droughts, has accelerated its breadth and depth. According to the Nanking telegram of August 21 of this newspaper, "The disaster area has spread to more than two-thirds of the country. Fourteen provinces and 343 counties have been affected by the drought, and 13 provinces have been affected by the flood. In addition, 8 provinces and 68 counties have been affected by locust plagues, and 12 provinces and 89 counties have been affected by hail and frost. The total loss is more than 1 billion yuan." Behind this alarming number, we can vaguely see the situation of countless peasants drifting and struggling under the black line of death.</p>
<p>Rural women, who account for half of the country's farmers, play an even more tragic program in this tragedy of drastic bankruptcy. I would like to use some of the information in the newspapers here to briefly explain the plot they have played.</p>
<p>The first is to go out to work as maids. The only way out for rural women in the midst of hunger and cold is to run to the city to work as female workers. However, the city's industry is affected by the recession, and workers are being laid off in batches, and even factories are closing down. Where else is there room to accommodate them? So they joined the headhunters and became the reserve army of maids.</p>
<p>According to the Damei Evening News of September 2, "This year, the drought in various counties of Jiangsu is very severe, so that the autumn harvest is hopeless, and farmers are panicked about food. As a result of the bankruptcy of the countryside, women from various counties have flocked to Shanghai to find jobs. They all enter the maid introduction agencies to wait for people to hire them, but only 40% of them can get jobs, and the rest are sitting idle hungry. According to detailed investigation, there are more than 500 maid introduction agencies in Shanghai. Each introduction agency has an average of 35 to 40 people who want to get a maid job. Only a very small number of people can get a job every day. Statistics show that more than 2,000 people want to find a maid job."</p>
<p>According to the Jiangpu Correspondence of the Ta Kung Pao on July 16, "This county has not rained since the summer, and the drought has already appeared. Women in the southwest area of the county have gone out to work as maids in succession because there is no food to eat. They leave their hometowns in groups to seek a full meal. The situation is very pitiful."</p>
<p>The situation of poor women working as maids in wealthy families in the countryside is even more tragic. For example, rural women in the suburbs of Xi'an, "mostly work as servants in wealthy families. The wages they receive are only 5 yuan a year, excluding the food and accommodation provided by the master. What they eat is mostly the leftovers of the master. The master eats wheat noodles, and the coolies eat mostly coarse grains. Therefore, there are two kinds of food with distinction in one family two meals a day, so their working life is no different from cattle and horses." (Hong Kong Industrial and Commercial Daily, March 14, Xi'an Special News)</p>
<p>The second is to become prostitutes. The fact that rural women become prostitutes is vividly described by Ji Xun:</p>
<p>"Whether in the countryside or in the city in northern Jiangsu, it is filled with poisonous and foul air. Open prostitutes and secret prostitutes are everywhere... Some rural women who have just been abandoned by the land take prostitution as their profession, and some take prostitution as their sideline. There are many young girls who are lonely and helpless. They are less than 14 years old. The virginity is trampled on, and they lose their health and destroy their physical development. Their lives are completely controlled by the procuress. However, most of them are sentenced to death by syphilis before they reach adulthood! Among them, there are also housewives who have to sell their chastity in exchange for family consumption because their children are crying from hunger and cold." (Zhonghua Daily, November 2-3)</p>
<p>The degree of proliferation of prostitutes is proportional to the degree of rural bankruptcy and recession. In October last year, the Public Concession Police Department arrested more than 1,000 secret prostitutes in one month. These are the phenomena caused by the recession and rural bankruptcy.</p>
<p>According to the Guangzhou 72nd Bank News (January 15 last year), "Since the silk industry has been in recession, nearly 100 silk factories in Nanshun have closed down. Tens of thousands of silk reeling women who used to rely on them for food and clothing have now become unemployed. These women mostly have bad customs and adhere to the doctrine of not returning home. They have now lost their ability to live independently, so most of them become maids. Those who do not know how to cherish themselves mostly move to quiet places in the market towns and secretly engage in ugly business."</p>
<p>The Shanghai Correspondence of the Nanning Republic Daily (June 14) is a poetic description of the fact that Suzhou women fall into brothels due to rural bankruptcy, that is, "Whenever the lights are first turned on, the taverns are filled with salted duck. Upstairs and downstairs, front and back, red and green. At the same time, there are also secret prostitutes running around with the old women on the road. It is said that there are about 2,000 such women in the area of Lümen (not counting the city). In the past two or three years, disasters have been frequent, and the rural economy has gone bankrupt. It is thought that more Suzhou women have been forced to jump into the fire pit because of their livelihood." The third is to be sold as slaves. In a society dominated by , the phenomenon of selling often exists. However, in the current process of cruel rural economic bankruptcy, this phenomenon is becoming more and more widespread.</p>
<p>According to the Xiaofeng Correspondence of the Southeast Daily (August 6), "Recently in the city, villagers often bring their children to the city to sell them, especially girls around the age of ten. They are sold to wealthy families as maids. The price is no more than 20 yuan... "</p>
<p>According to the Huzhou Correspondence, "In various places in western Zhejiang, the countryside is frequently going bankrupt. Who would have thought that this year's drought would cause a disaster, and the autumn harvest would be hopeless. At the same time, the price of silk has plummeted, falling directly to 13 or 4 yuan. The plight of the peasants is beyond words. Among them, the obedient ones eat wild vegetables and bark to fill their hunger, and sell their wives and children to pay off their debts. When they are forced to the point of no return, they commit suicide... "</p>
<p>The fourth is suicide. The tragic events of rural women "committing suicide by jumping into the river" and "hanging themselves" due to the pressure of life and lack of rice to cook are often heard in the newspapers, but due to the limited space, I cannot give examples here. Please forgive the readers.</p>
<p>All in all, the program played by rural women in this tragedy of rural bankruptcy is particularly tragic! Rural women account for more than 80% of the country's women, and they are all productive masses with labor capacity.</p>
<h3 id="e294">Who is the "New Woman"? <a href="#e294" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c294" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">294</a></h3>
<p>— Xian</p>
<p>After watching "New Woman"丨</p>
<p>Bearing the burden of life, how many leisurely days have I enjoyed? It was an accidental opportunity that squeezed me into the Jincheng Cinema to watch "New Woman" produced by Lianhua No. 2 Factory; this is considered very lucky.</p>
<p>I don't want to criticize the artistic value of this film here. It's just that after watching this film, I have a question: who exactly is the "New Woman"?</p>
<p>Under the current situation in China, a real "New Woman" cannot be produced, just as the "New Woman" cannot be performed on "New Woman". In this film: if we say that A Ying is the "New Woman," the impression she gives us is too lacking in depth and too hidden. "She" cannot be very active and prominent even on the screen, almost to the point that we don't pay attention to her.</p>
<p>Wei Ming is only an "incomplete," "fallen," "New Woman." She only jumped out of the tangible circle of old ethics, but finally could not jump out of the invisible iron ring of old ethics. What class of women does she represent in the identity she performs? We can see it in her vanity of hiding her background and the kind of life she lives.</p>
<p>Wei Ming's background is undoubtedly a young lady from a family of scholars for generations. This can be seen in the section where her sister tells her daughter the history of her struggle to leave the family in the past: and she is also an educated intellectual woman. Such women are too deeply poisoned by feudal ideas to jump out of that class; because of their status, she cannot dress simply and endure hardship like A Ying. If Wei Ming's position were given to A Ying, I believe A Ying would definitely be able to handle it with ease, without any problems. 丨Not only could the child be saved, but she would not die, and she would have already avenged the various insults she suffered from society.</p>
<p>Wei Ming attaches so much importance to chastity, which is of course a characteristic of the personality of such women. She would rather watch a smart and lively beloved daughter die than sacrifice her chastity. Her selfishness has reached this point. As for "enduring humiliation and bearing heavy burdens," selling chastity and saving other people's lives, think about it: which thing is more able to show the nobility and greatness of a woman's personality?</p>
<p>I don't want to encourage new women not to have chastity and deliberately destroy their bodies for revenge. However, under the current situation, the misfortune of women is unavoidable; those who are in the situation, weigh the pros and cons: if they have to sacrifice, why should we care about chastity and hurt the overall situation?</p>
<p>Ruan Lingyu's Wei Ming in "New Woman" is a fallen woman; lacking the "bravery," "sacrifice," "simplicity," and "endurance" of the "new spirit" and "new morality" of the "New Woman." Our real "New Woman" A Ying only occupies an unimportant position here and has not been revealed directly. 丨This is what the female group who have watched "New Woman" should recognize clearly.</p>

<p>— Li Anfu</p>
<p>In the current society, there are many people who are engaged in occupations but feel that their knowledge is not enough. Everyone is saying this: "It's a pity that I am a poor person and I read a few years less." Or: "Why didn't my father let me read a few years more?" When we first hear this kind of words, we may sympathize with him and feel sorry for the environment he encountered. However, if we go through a thorough consideration, we can find that his saying this is just moving words on the mouth; in fact, he does not really need to want to study, or at least he still thinks that studying and seeking knowledge is a difficult thing. This is what we dare to assert.</p>
<p>If we open any book recording the success of mankind, whether Chinese or foreign, ancient or modern, or any kind of subject, most of them are people who self-studied or even studied hard in their early years, but they are shining brightly and are worshiped by later generations. Undoubtedly, moving and dazzling titles and qualifications may not be obtained without money; however, outside the door of learning, there is no sign saying "No Entry for Idlers". It is always smelling the door and welcoming anyone to walk into this door, and it will never discriminate against you because of your poverty; its tolerance may be more practical and reliable than the gifts of Bodhisattva or God. From this, it can be seen that those who sigh that they have no books to read are not being rejected by books, but they do not want to read them. That is to say, in their lives, there is not no way to read books, but they have a way and they just stand by the road and sigh and do not want to walk up.</p>
<p>However, is self-study absolutely unconditional? With what conditions can one embark on this path of self-study? Yes, this condition is not only the condition for self-study, but also the secret to the success of all kinds of careers in life; needless to say, that is concentration and perseverance. In China, there are almost countless maxims about this kind of thing and the history of successful people; even in the words and deeds of successful people in foreign countries, there are also many that can be used as mottoes for our self-learners. Like Smiles said: "Success comes from overcoming difficulties." Marten said: "A focused and healthy goal can cure thousands of diseases." Kingsley said: "When I start doing what I do, it seems that there is nothing else to do in the world." The most thorough thing about this kind of talk is Carlyle. He said: "The abilities of creatures are different in strength and weakness, but even the weakest person, if he can concentrate all his abilities and concentrate on one thing, then, even if the ability is weak, there will be considerable success. On the contrary, a person with great ability, if he is distracted to engage in various undertakings, his result will definitely be nothing." Therefore, the constant dripping of water can penetrate huge stones; the rushing torrents will not even leave a trace afterwards. Indeed, if we study on our own without concentration and perseverance, then the final result will be like a torrent of water without a trace. Because the facts tell us that true knowledge is the fairest thing in the world. If you lack the above two spirits, even if you spend money and time to buy and expect, it will never give you unconditionally. If we have the above spirit to study on our own, not to mention the academic achievements can reach the highest peak, even if this perseverance is used in the development of the cause, it will not be of considerable help!</p>
<p>Shouting emptyly to demand true knowledge will never increase your practical knowledge; this is as correct as sticking a piece of paper with the four words "Bring Me Wealth" on the wall of the opposite door. Sitting and cursing the loss of past opportunities is nothing more than cursing. If we who are engaged in occupations want to acquire some true knowledge, we should strive to explore it in order to be successful.</p>
<p>Emerson said: "No one in the world can destroy your success except yourself." Cursing and sighing is your own destruction; truly, only focusing on hard work is a path to success.</p>

<h3 id="e296">Watched Two Dance Performances <a href="#e296" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c296" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">296</a></h3>
<p>— Man Yun</p>
<p>丨Xinhua at Jin Cheng · Fei Yan Society at Carlton丨</p>
<p>The dance world currently doesn't have a fixed base. They can only take advantage of seasons when film sales aren't doing well to "make a splash" in movie theaters. Near the Lunar New Year, affairs are chaotic, and the people with free time to watch movies are ultimately too few. Movie theater business inevitably suffers. Even good films are probably hard to sell for money. No foolish boss would release a good film at this time. Some simple merchandise is bound to be pushed out to "suit the occasion," so dance can also try its hand during this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Last Lunar New Year, Xinhua at Jin Cheng and Fei Yan's debut at Carlton managed to cause a temporary sensation, which was also due to these reasons. I watched these two performances, and I want to express my admiration for their efforts and their refusal to use sensuality as a selling point. However, I cannot help but express my thoughts on the results of their performances. Now I will write down my observations.</p>
<p>First, I want to talk about Xinhua. Xinhua is a somewhat famous dance troupe in Shanghai. Although it hasn't been established for long, it has had several performances. This troupe has a strong "business sense." Usually, many members are involved in the film and broadcasting industries. Therefore, the arrangement of new programs is often limited by time and talent. In the past, they had brought out some simple leftovers from the Bright Moon Society to give to the audience. This time, they similarly lack new contributions. For example, the program I saw on January 25th included things like "Peach Blossom River," "Peanuts," "Fair Trade," "Farewell My Brother," "Secrets of Love," "Heart of Love," "Special Express," "Jasmine Gracious Village," "Silver River Twin Stars," etc. Needless to say, the content is empty and simple. Even the melodies are mostly outdated and difficult to give high praise (the Li-style dance is difficult to obtain high praise whether in music or dance). It is worth mentioning the several "talents" that Xinhua used to attract attention this time. I didn't see "Lei Ying Star" Wang Renmei and "Singer" Wang Manjie's "guest appearances," so I can't say anything. However, their voices probably won't disappoint the audience too much. Among the guest performers, Yuan Meiyun is a very eye-catching one. This time, I watched her collaborations with Zhou Xuan in "Jasmine Yearning for Home" and with Yan Hua in "Peach Blossom River," among other programs. People generally say that Yuan Meiyun has a lot of promise. In reality, this "bud that needs irrigation and nurturing" does indeed have performing talent. If it weren't for the excessive praise of bored people and the relationship of business sense, she would indeed have a future. Saying she is a "beautiful little bird" certainly underestimates her, and treating her as a "money tree" also seems short-sighted. A truly pure artist should refuse all unwanted invitations, and "hanging the first signboard" is only the pursuit and behavior of those who are eager for vanity and unwilling to make progress. As for the program, performing "Peach Blossom River" at this time, no matter how skilled the performance, is undoubtedly insignificant. Similarly, in "Jasmine Yearning for Home," she and Zhou Xuan both have excellent performances, but this kind of thing itself doesn't have much value. Even if it's performed well, what does that count for? In order to do a "deal," when Fei Yan Society performed at Carlton, she also collaborated with Fei Yan's Louis on "Selling Flowers" and sang "Little Jasmine" solo. Our views on these two programs are the same as above. In addition, Chen Jingfang, Jiang Manli, and others also made guest appearances in Xinhua's performances. Both of their voices have unattainable qualities, but they also have a common problem: their enunciation is not very clear, and the tunes they sing are mostly sentimental "靡靡之音" (decadent music).</p>
<p>Xinhua's main actress, Zhou Xuan, is a talented singer and dancer. She has a lot of talent, but unfortunately, her talent is not used very appropriately. She appeared in "Special Express" with a lively and humorous demeanor. Her role was suitable, and her performance was not bad. She played the main role in "Secrets of Love," "Light of the Nation," "Fair Trade," "Heart of Love," and "Fengyang Woman," and she was able to handle them all happily. "Fair Trade" touched on the realistic problem of unemployment, but unfortunately, it trivialized the seriousness of this problem. In "Fengyang Woman," she and Yu Hua wore colorful dance costumes and sang and danced. We couldn't see the pain of the wandering life of the Fengyang women who left their hometowns under the intertwined oppression of natural disasters and man-made calamities. This disregard for real life is a common feature of Xinhua's programs!</p>
<p>Fei Yan's performance at Carlton, although not as commercially successful as Xinhua, perhaps has a more progressive understanding of dance. They want to get rid of the Li-style tradition of "forest of powdered legs" and "half-exposed breasts," attempting to change the trend of the dance world with new forms and content. They use a large number of exotic programs, such as "Gypsy Dance," "Cossack Dance," "Palace Dance," "Hungarian Dance," "Naval Review," etc., which are all very eye-catching. In particular, "Gypsy Dance," with its strong rhythm and dance, and "Cossack Dance," which reveals a kind of robust appearance through its rough rhythm, can both make people feel excited and powerful. In addition, the newly compiled "Selling Cloth Ballad" also quite expresses one side of the lives of people in the lower classes. As for the "Savage Dance" performed by Xu Canying and Huang Hun, although the performance is skilled, the content of this kind of thing cannot but make people frown.</p>
<p>There is also one program in Fei Yan's performance that cannot be missed: the three-act dance drama "Blood and Tears on the Battlefield." Although "Blood and Tears on the Battlefield" adopted the realistic theme of volunteer soldiers resisting the enemy, this theme was destroyed by the play's inappropriate arrangement. Strictly speaking, this play is a patchwork success. There is no emotional process, no plot connection, no complete story... Even the inserted dances and songs seem to be pieced together, far-fetched and stiff.</p>
<p>Fei Yan has a promising future. We hope that its members can reflect, and we also hope that it can accept external criticism and establish dance art in a realm that does not anesthetize the audience and does not beautify reality. To sing of "peace and prosperity through song and dance" at this time is certainly a "chronistic error." Dance is by no means a hymn in the mouth of a pastor, nor is it an ice cream for the eyes to eat, but it must be a performance of objective reality.</p>

<p>"I cannot do this." The lieutenant said to Alexander in this way. At that time, the military situation was extremely tense, and the fortress had been lost. "Go forward!" The general replied: "Trying can lead to success." Finally, the dense formation moved forward and defeated the enemy.</p>
<p>Napoleon visited the plague victims in Egypt, and he told them that a person must not destroy his courage with fear. A willpower is like a strong tonic to the human body, which can stimulate people to complete superhuman acts. Napoleon also said: "The word 'difficult' exists only in the dictionary of fools." When we examine his life's great achievements, he never saw obstruction in the word "difficult." He always used a steel heart and iron will to overcome all difficulties.</p>
<p>Walter Scott was in debt for more than 60,000 yuan at the age of fifty-five. He decided that every yuan of debt must be cleared before his death. This strong determination was deeply buried in his mind, and every nerve and muscle was engraved with the idea of ​​repaying the debt. He worked hard to write articles in exchange for money, and finally all his debts were cleared. In his diary, he said: "Although I am busy all day, I must work hard to attack." This is his strong willpower.</p>
<p>"If ordinary people have will, there is nothing difficult. If this is needed, then it must be done; thus, one can succeed." Mirabeau once said this.</p>
<p>Someone said that Pitt's only plan was to "break through the difficulties." He said, "Is that difficult? I have overcome obstacles." His service and loyalty in Congress are admirable.</p>
<p>Darwin was a sickly child. Although he suffered frequently, his patience was admirable. His son said of him: "In four years, my father never knew a healthy day." Because in the period of forty years, he only worked constantly. He had a strange power, that is, he liked to concentrate on one thing.</p>
<p>De Vere has an old poem, although the words are old and decayed, its meaning is immortal. 丨丨</p>
<p>"Man's victory lies in sincerity, a steel heart and iron will overcome the enemy, the weak but have courage, can make defeat turn into victory."</p>

<h3 id="e298">How to Write Literary Works? <a href="#e298" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c298" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">298</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Jicong</p>
<p>If you are a young student or a white-collar worker who loves literature and you want to learn to write literary works, or you are writing literary works, then a question must arise in your mind: how to write? I want to discuss this question with you now, and I think this is something you would be happy to do.</p>
<p>First of all, if you want to write novels, poems, or dramas, you must have the technical ability to write. If you don't know how to describe emotions and scenery, and you don't have the artistic talent to portray things, you can't write literary works. But this artistic talent does not come from innate ability, but depends on your acquired cultivation. In this process, I hope you don't believe in those so-called novel or poetry writing methods that are popular on the market, because these things are mostly scams. Even if you read ten or eight books of this kind of so-called writing methods, at most you will only know some mechanical methods of making sentences and refining words, and you cannot increase your artistic talent. I think the most necessary thing for you is to read more great works by great writers, and learn the methods of description from Shakespeare, Goethe, Balzac, Flaubert, Turgenev, Gorky... melt their artistic description rules into your own description rules, and engage in literary creation. In this way, through continuous hard work in writing, your artistic talent will naturally increase day by day.</p>
<p>Secondly, speaking of writing, of course it is necessary to have writing material. Some people say that the subject matter is not important, natural scenery, the wealth of the rich, the suffering of the poor, the sorrow of young girls... can all be used as subject matter. The problem lies only in what viewpoint to express it from, that is, how to express it. In fact, this only sees the importance of the creative attitude; it ignores the activeness of the subject matter. Because literary works are artistically</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>Reflecting social life to unite human thoughts and feelings, if the things described by the writer have a very close and obvious relationship with the lives of most social people, then its binding force on human beings in terms of thought and emotion will inevitably be great; conversely, if the writer describes things that have no direct and obvious relationship with our lives, then its moving power will be very small. For example, in present-day China, the issues that have the greatest relationship with the lives of ordinary people are the issue of imperialist aggression, natural disasters, and the decline of industry and commerce and the bankruptcy of the rural economy. If you do not find subject matter among these, or even if you do not find subject matter that has the greatest relationship with these phenomena, and you go to describe natural scenery or rare and special social phenomena, then even if you have great artistic talent, you cannot write literary works with great value that are suitable for the needs of the objective world. Therefore, in choosing subject matter, you must rely on your life experience, your feelings and observations, and use things that have the greatest relationship with our lives, the main social phenomena, and typical social life and its trends as subject matter to strive for your creation.</p>
<p>At the same time, your sincerity to things and the position you stand in when creating are especially important. We know that under the same subject matter, if two writers with different viewpoints are asked to create, then the social thoughts and emotions expressed will inevitably be different, and therefore their values ​​will also be different. For example, if the "January 28th" Japanese attack on China incident is used as subject matter, if a writer with a profiteering merchant's consciousness and a writer who fights for the independence of the Chinese nation are asked to write, then the content and value of the works they write will be very different. At the same time, literature likes truth, and the value of literary works is mainly determined by whether the thoughts expressed are true and to what extent. George said: "When false and incorrect thoughts lie at the root of an artistic work, then the thoughts cause internal contradictions in the work, and therefore the aesthetic value of the work will inevitably be harmed." But how can we prevent "false and incorrect thoughts from lying in the work"? How can we express the truth? This depends on your ideology, your worldview, and your position.</p>
<p>Naturally, when describing, you can start from the beginning of the story and write all the way down; you can also write from the end of the story to the beginning and the middle; you can also start from the middle and look back to the beginning and then expand to the future: these can all be at your convenience, depending on how the description is suitable for the story and thoughts you want to express, and you will describe it that way. However, there is one point that you must decide, that is, you must not narrate flatly or preach abstractly, you must describe it concretely and vividly. For the expression of the characters' emotions and for the development of things, you must grasp their concrete dynamics to describe them, and you must not make abstract preaching under the law of tranquility. In Guyau's "Art from a Sociological Perspective," there are these sentences:</p>
<p>"Your tone is more beautiful than your voice,</p>
<p>Your smile is more lovely than your lips,</p>
<p>Your eyes are better than your eyes,</p>
<p>Its brilliance, no fire has such a flame."</p>
<p>Why is this? Because moving postures are more stimulating to the senses and more eye-catching than static shapes. In artistic expression, vivid descriptions have a greater artistic power to move people than calm narratives.</p>
<p>Finally, the so-called artistic talent, the so-called choice of subject matter, the so-called position, and the so-called description rules are all closely related to your life. Therefore, you must live earnestly and have rich life experience to write literary works. Sometimes, practical investigation and experience of various social lives are also necessary for you. Tolstoy criticized Turgenev, saying, "You only know life from newspapers," of course, he meant that you should actually investigate life; Zola had to visit the characters he wanted to portray and investigate the life he wanted to express before writing... It is indeed very necessary to actually investigate and experience life like this sometimes. Because some social lives cannot be understood without actual experience, and naturally they cannot be described. Therefore, in order to create, in addition to living earnestly in your living environment, you should also go to the general public to enrich your life experience and knowledge.</p>

<h3 id="e300">Postscript on "Under the Mercury Lamp" and "Song of Spring" <a href="#e300" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c300" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">300</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Ying</p>
<p>In this year of theatrical silence, the performance of the two plays "Under the Mercury Lamp" and "Song of Spring" can be regarded as a noteworthy event. In addition to admiring the perseverance and enthusiasm of the gentlemen of the Shanghai Stage Association for drama, we also want to say a few words about the content and performance of these two plays:</p>
<p>㈠ "Under the Mercury Lamp"</p>
<p>"Under the Mercury Lamp" is a play that takes its material from the real life of the film industry. It not only shows the different tasks of film practitioners in the process of film production, but also portrays their unique feelings and personalities based on their different positions. This place even puts special emphasis on the latter point, describing the unbearable aspects of the working lives of senior film practitioners, such as managers, directors, stage managers, set designers, photographers, sound engineers, big stars... and the depravity of life, the superficiality of knowledge and learning... All the various forms in the "dark circle" are objectively recorded here with a hint of satire. The difficult experiences of some lower-level employees, especially extras, and their courage to fight against life are also vividly portrayed here.</p>
<p>The plot of this play is very simple, it is just a record of a true image under the mercury lamp and the adventure and patriotic enthusiasm of an extra. The hardship and hard work of the extras, the humiliation and molestation of female extras by senior personnel are inserted here and are important themes used here; but what is more important is the encounter of the extra C 丨 丨 a person who failed to resist the enemy in the Northeast and returned to Shanghai, and only works as an extra to make a living 丨 丨 and his wife who became a female star, as well as his enthusiasm for resisting the enemy. He rebuked his wife who sold her soul. He did not listen to the director's instructions. In the scene of retreating, he replaced it with advancing. The heroic national war in the Northeast swayed in his memory, arousing his passionate and forward emotions. In this age of forgetfulness, such subject matter can undoubtedly evoke our painful memories.</p>
<p>The production technique of this play is generally good, but there are also some minor problems. For the sake of space, I don't want to say how tight its structure is, how vivid its character is, and how humorous its dialogue is... I just want to review a little bit of its flaws. I think the chance encounter between the extra C and his wife is a bit "no coincidence, no play". Even if this kind of thing is quite possible, it seems that the playwright did not properly expose it in advance, and it is difficult to make people believe it deeply.</p>
<p>The performance of the actors, because those who appear on stage are all experienced people, the results will certainly not disappoint people. Speaking of personal achievements, the director of Wan Laitian, the male and female stars of Zheng Junli and Hu Ping, and the extra C of Yuan Muzhi are all worth mentioning.</p>
<p>㈡ "Song of Spring"</p>
<p>"Song of Spring" is a very moving play. There are tragic and fierce scenes here, typical character descriptions, and generous and sorrowful dirges. There is a kind of passionate enthusiasm, calm courage, and determination to sacrifice, which covers this "Song of Spring" with a layer of tragic and heavy mist.</p>
<p>The plot is not that complicated, it just describes the heroic experience and unfortunate encounter of three young educators who ran back to the motherland from Nanyang to join the Volunteer Army. The first act writes about their life in Nanyang and their indignation at the fall of the Northeast. The characteristics of the male and female protagonists and the depth of their private relationship are also well explained in the first act. A kind of deep friendship is also inserted through two supporting roles. The difficulties of the Nanyang Chinese in starting a business, their current mistreatment by the local government, and the economic crisis in Nanyang are all briefly mentioned in the mouths of the actors. In the second act, the male protagonist Wei Han and his friends Si Xun and Bi Ru did not make it to the Northeast, but they achieved their desire to serve the motherland in the "January 28th" war in Shanghai. The stage is set with the scene of a wounded soldier hospital run by overseas Chinese. Here we see the groans of some respectable wounded soldiers, the diagnosis and treatment of admirable doctors, the care of young ladies, and the admirable and great enthusiasm of the people for resisting the enemy. Everything is a magnificent reenactment of the enthusiasm of the people in the rear during the "January 28th" period to resist the enemy. In the third act, Wei Han was injured and became an idiot; but because of the sound of firecrackers on this New Year's Day, it aroused his tragic memories of charging, and he recovered his neurological health in this memory.</p>
<p>The general outline of the whole play is roughly like this. The unattainable aspect of this play is that the subject matter is true, especially the fact that it is closely linked with the current crisis of our nation and the bright prospects of its future. Although there are still some accidental coincidences in the writing technique, on the whole, this play is worth seeing.</p>
<p>The actors are almost all All-Star Cast. Due to long-term training and excellent guidance from the host, the performance results can generally be said to be good. The personal achievements of the actors are excellent, including Wang Renmei, Wang Ying, Zhao Dan, Mei Xi, Jin Yan, and Wei Helin.</p>

<h3 id="e301">Year-End of the Abandoned Calendar in My Hometown <a href="#e301" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c301" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">301</a></h3>
<p>— Jia Yu</p>
<p>The days grew longer after the "Winter Solstice". The ship I was on docked at the Jiujiang wharf, and the sun was still a bright red, hanging high in the sky, reflecting in the river, creating colorful rays like shimmering fish scales.</p>
<p>The day the ship arrived happened to be the morning of the abandoned calendar's New Year's Eve. The ship was full of passengers like me, returning home for the New Year (?). On everyone's face, you could see the joy that came from the heart, and the ship was filled with pleasant air.</p>
<p>As the ship approached the "pontoon," still a dozen feet away, the porters standing on the "pontoon" seemed to be desperate for food. They leapt onto the ship one by one, like eagles pouncing on their prey; their movements were as quick as arrows, and they were upon you before you could blink.</p>
<p>Watching this kind of competition for survival, I felt a little scared. Good heavens! A distance of more than ten feet – if one were to slip, would one survive? I wondered.</p>
<p>After all, the issue of eating was more serious than any other. Therefore, what I was thinking perhaps didn't even exist in their minds. So, before the ship was properly docked at the "pontoon," they had already jumped aboard, some even finding customers.</p>
<p>I was in the rear cabin, and the porters hadn't reached there yet. The steward bundled up my luggage and placed it on the berth, telling me to wait by the side door.</p>
<p>He said, "Sir, don't wander off. This wharf is worse than others. If you look away for a moment, your things will be stolen."</p>
<p>"Thank you, I know!" I smiled at him.</p>
<p>At this moment, three or four porters rushed in from the front cabin. Each held a carrying pole made of half a bamboo, with two hemp rope "pads" the size of copper gongs hanging from it. This was their entire "livelihood" for making a living.</p>
<p>"Sir! Are you going to the city? I'll carry it for you, cheap!" A porter, appearing familiar, walked into my cabin and lifted the bedding.</p>
<p>"Put it down! We'll agree on the price before you move anything!" I glared at him.</p>
<p>He suddenly felt a sense of surprise, his body trembled slightly, and he took two steps back, a look of disappointment immediately surfacing on his face. He never expected that I would be from Jiujiang!</p>
<p>"Sir! Easy, easy; we're from the same hometown, would I overcharge you?" he said with a forced smile.</p>
<p>"No, it's best to agree on it first. How much to carry it into the city?" I pretended to be an experienced traveler.</p>
<p>"Sir, we're from the same hometown, no 'empty talk,' let's say five jiao!" he said, stretching out a thick arm, looking very determined.</p>
<p>"Five jiao? "I glanced at the porters behind him, thinking that surely one or two of them would automatically lower the price.</p>
<p>"Five jiao, truly not cheating you, sir!" he quickly added before the other porters could speak.</p>
<p>"Not cheating? Nonsense! I used to pay others at most one jiao, and you're saying five, huh!"</p>
<p>"One jiao? You can't get anyone to carry it for that price anymore! Sir, you don't know how hard it is to carry things now. Even with five jiao for carrying a load, it's not enough to eat. You, sir, are involved in big money, you don't know our hardships! If you, sir, want someone to carry it, honestly, let's say four jiao!" An older porter standing behind him chimed in, explaining at length.</p>
<p>I was getting a little impatient, and I quickly interrupted him, saying, "Fine, it's three jiao, I won't pay you a single copper more!"</p>
<p>The porters looked at each other, all silently focusing their gaze on me.</p>
<p>"What do you say? Hurry up and speak!" I urged them.</p>
<p>"You carry it for him, okay?" The older porter, with a look of disappointment, said to the porter who had spoken first.</p>
<p>This was my first time returning home for the "New Year" in five years. The bedding and suitcase were still the same two items I had when I left, but now they were even more worn out. The two items rested on the porter's shoulder, as light as two bundles of torn cotton, swaying back and forth as he walked.</p>
<p>"Three jiao, to carry it to the city, really cheap," I heard the old porter say as I walked onto the deck.</p>
<p>The porter and I walked from the wharf to "Zheng Street." This hometown street, which I hadn't seen in five years, had aged with the ruthless passage of time!</p>
<p>Although some of the shops on both sides were equipped with wireless radios like those in Shanghai, as a way to attract customers, the number of people who could actually go in and buy things was few enough to count. This desolate scene was absolutely unheard of on New Year's Eve of the abandoned calendar five years ago!</p>
<p>When I arrived home, two tables had already been placed together in the middle of the parlor, neatly arranged with the "three sacrificial animals." In front of the table was a large brazier, burning bright red charcoal. The crackling sound of the exploding charcoal was like the sound of firecrackers. This was probably in preparation for "Returning Blessings."</p>
<p>In this parlor where my shadow had disappeared for five years, I suddenly reappeared. No wonder my mother was so stunned at the time that she couldn't speak for a long time. Her entire heart was covered with this unexpected joy. Her aging face was filled with smiles, as if she had made a great fortune. She was so happy that she even forgot to prepare the New Year's Eve meal for the offerings.</p>
<p>The people at home all hoped for me to return like this. However, what could I bring to comfort them? Five years of wandering had deprived me of my inherent innocence and simplicity, and had severed my emotional connection with my family. During these long five years, the shadow of my family had gradually faded in my mind with the passing days, and even the faintest impression was gone! However, they were still as kind and sincere to me as they had been in the past. Perhaps my return this time would add a lot of interest to the New Year they were celebrating!</p>
<p>I stared blankly at the "Returning Blessings" offerings on the table for a while, and my mother thought I was tired from the boat and feeling unwell. She quickly reached out and touched my cheeks, asking me with concern, "Ju'er! What's wrong, are you feeling uncomfortable anywhere? Huh?"</p>
<p>"Nothing! I see that there's 'real chicken' for 'Returning Blessings' on the table this year. I find that very strange!" I said, smiling at my mother.</p>
<p>"Oh!" Mother thought she understood what I meant, and a look of relief surfaced on her face. Then, she told me the reason for using "real chicken" for "Returning Blessings" this year. She said, "Ju'er! You don't know, this year the price of chicken is almost the same as fake chicken! Radishes! Almost the same, one dollar buys ten-plus jin, and they're big, fat hens! Hey! Country people usually hold chickens in their hands, shouting 'one dollar for twelve jin,' and no one wants them. These past few days, as New Year's is approaching, they're only selling for one dollar for ten jin. I'm lucky I bought them early, otherwise I would have lost out!" Mother said, sighing.</p>
<p>"One dollar for ten jin of chicken? That's practically like eating chicken as rice!" I couldn't quite believe that my mother's words were definitely reliable.</p>
<p>"Eating it as rice? Can't be done! Country people still need rice!" Mother retorted.</p>
<p>I was supposed to burn incense and kowtow for "Returning Blessings" this year. Although I was full of reluctance, there was no way to refuse. After a while, all the cooked dishes for the New Year's Eve dinner were brought out, and the table was so full that there was no room to place the wine cups. Later, there were a few bowls that really couldn't fit, so I told them to take them back. However, Mother was a little unwilling, as if she was complaining that I hadn't burned incense and kowtowed when "Returning Blessings" at home in the past five years, and that I still wasn't sincere this time?</p>
<p>That evening's New Year's Eve dinner was a very happy one for everyone. Mother, needless to say, was even happier because I would be spending the New Year at home this year. She usually didn't drink much wine, but tonight she made an exception and had two cups. Later, my sister was afraid that she would get drunk, so she didn't pour her any more.</p>
<p>"Ju'er! If you come back for the New Year again next year, I don't know how happy Mother will be!" my sister said, looking at my mother, whose face was full of smiles.</p>
<p>"Hmm!" I just smiled slightly; I really didn't dare to guarantee that I would be able to come back next year, so I just gave a perfunctory response.</p>
<p>However, Mother had great hopes. She said in a commanding tone, "Of course you have to come back for the New Year next year. Where's the sense in leaving home for years and not coming back, forgetting even your family? As the saying goes, 'A tree may grow a thousand feet tall, but its leaves return to the roots.' If you don't come back usually, you should always come back for the New Year! 'With money or without money, come home for the New Year.' Look at Third Uncle of the Big House in front, he's so far away in Beiping, but he still rushes back for the New Year!"</p>
<p>"With money or without money, come home for the New Year." I understood what Mother meant by saying this. She was afraid that I would be too embarrassed to come back if I didn't have money, so she encouraged me that the family would always welcome me even if I didn't have money. However, my thinking was exactly the opposite of hers; I felt that if I didn't have money, there was no need to celebrate the New Year, and that with money, every day was like celebrating the New Year. I still didn't know what changes my life and future would bring next year, so I couldn't guarantee whether I would be able to go back for the New Year!</p>

<h3 id="e302">Zheng Banqiao's Sayings <a href="#e302" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c302" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">302</a></h3>
<p>— Chong Shi</p>
<p>Zheng Banqiao is one of the past literary figures that I particularly admire. I like his free and unrestrained character, his unconventional behavior, and also his unique style of painting orchids and bamboos and his calligraphy. Although he was just an ordinary bureaucrat in his middle age, having lost the fresh temperament of his youth, he was still a person capable of writing well and cultivating moral character. His words of wisdom on reading, learning, and conducting oneself are still worth our emulating. I have read many of his family letters in my spare time, and I have now excerpted some of his wise sayings for our discerning readers to use as a reference:</p>
<p>Reading should be diligent and not lax, and reading books should be careful and constant.</p>
<p>For important points, take notes in a reading diary; for points that are difficult to understand, write them down on a separate piece of paper and seek clarification from a teacher.</p>
<p>When reading a book and encountering sentences that are useful in practice, they should be recorded immediately; if they can be categorized and compiled into a large volume, they can be used as material for writing, and the benefits are endless.</p>
<p>Governing is not about much talking, and neither is learning.</p>
<p>When people study, they cannot be sure of achieving success, but even if they do not achieve success, they must study. Set your mind on it. If fame does not come, knowledge remains with me, and it is not a losing proposition.</p>
<p>The most important thing in writing is to be calm and incisive, as in the *Zuo Zhuan*, *Shi Ji*, Zhuangzi, Lisao, Du Fu's poems, and Han Yu's prose.</p>
<p>To be able to recite a book after reading it once is not the most effective way. To understand with the eyes but be hasty in the mind, with little room in the heart and unable to cope with the constant flow, is like looking at a beautiful woman in a theater, glancing once and passing her by, what does it have to do with me?</p>
<p>Rather than making indiscriminate friends and incurring losses, it is better to be isolated and ignorant.</p>
<p>If people are seen as lovable, then I am also lovable; if people are seen as detestable, then I am also detestable.</p>
<p>When it comes to writing and scholarship, people often think they are superior and that success is within easy reach, but they are all just taking chances.</p>
<p>I have never liked keeping birds in cages. I seek pleasure, but they are in prison; what kind of feeling or reason is it to bend the nature of things to suit my own nature?</p>
<p>A gentleman who studies the Way loves others, governs with a broad vision, and does not advocate overcorrection.</p>
<p>There are five ways to maintain health: (1) Get up early at dawn and eat a bowl of plain porridge, without any side dishes; (2) Take a walk after meals, aiming for a thousand steps; (3) Meditate at a fixed time, sitting quietly for a while after school each day; (4) Do not get annoyed or angry when encountering things; (5) Do not think after going to bed.</p>
<p>Book and Magazine Reviews</p>
<h3 id="e303">Reading "New Life" Volumes One, Numbers Forty-Eight and Forty-Nine <a href="#e303" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c303" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">303</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Chong</p>
<p>丨Published by New Life Weekly, priced at four cents per copy丨</p>
<p>"New Life" is currently the most popular little publication among ordinary progressive small and medium-sized clerks and young students in China. It is said to have already had five or six thousand readers. This is naturally very "special" in the current situation of the general book industry downturn and in the year of "magazine competition". However, this special situation is not caused by the "special" distribution methods of the "New Life" publishers, but by its good content. I am a regular reader of "New Life". Now I will write down my feelings after reading the "New Life" in the forty-eighth and forty-ninth issues of Volume One, so that readers can know a general outline of this publication.</p>
<p>Lying is annoying, and truth is lovely. "New Life" tells the truth, so it can gain the love of a wide range of readers. It bravely approaches reality, observes with fair and scientific eyes, and vividly reveals its true posture. For example, Bi Yuncheng's "Distribution of American Wealth" in issue 48 truly expresses the extremely unequal essence of the gilded kingdom of gold that our gilded doctors yearn for; and Yi Shui's "Decline of Gandhism" and Xing Su's "Thoughts on Reading Newspapers" in issue 49 both tell us truthfully about the decline of Gandhism in India and the faces of the gentlemen. 丨丨Boldly speaking "honest words" is the first characteristic of "New Life".</p>
<p>Second, "New Life" does not rummage through China's old wastepaper baskets, nor does it transport foreign antiques. What it talks about are all realistic issues that are closely related to our lives. For example, Kan Ru's "Dong Shi Imitating Xi Shi", Fang Yin's "People Who Joke with Peace", Yu Zhen's "What is the Biggest Enemy of Women?" and Ge Qiao's "The Third Reich with Latent Internal Worries" (issue 48) and "The Reef of the Baltic Sea 丨丨Memel" (issue 49) are all talking about realistic Chinese or world issues. Among them, "Dong Shi Imitating Xi Shi" expresses the ugliness of all imperialists, the enemies of our nation; "People Who Joke with Peace" says that the minions of the God of War, Henderson (chairman of the disarmament conference), Briand (the deceased French Foreign Minister), and Sir Austen Chamberlain (a major shareholder of the British Vickers arms factory), have all received the Nobel Peace Prize; "What is the Biggest Enemy of Women?" warns and satirizes those "new women" who only pay attention to formal, inconsistent words and deeds. The author made this powerful warning at the end: "The road is long, it does not need empty talk but needs to be walked down step by step. If even naturally big feet want to pretend to be like the vile and stinky three-inch golden lotuses, then it is the most shameful expression of slavishness, and this slavishness is the biggest enemy of women."; "The Third Reich with Latent Internal Worries" and "The Reef of the Baltic Sea 丨丨Memel" scientifically analyze the two international issues that are closely related to the current world crisis.</p>
<p>Third, in addition to publishing opinions that are closely related to our lives, "New Life" also publishes things that describe the lives of various professions and the situations in various places. Cheng Heqiu's "Looking at the Iron Industry in the World War Again", Lu Xinqiu's "From Jiangnan to Qingdao" in issue 48, and Wei Chuan's "Trainees in the Electric Light Company" in issue 49, etc., are not only texts of true life sketches, but also good materials for literary writers and good materials for studying social problems.</p>
<p>Fourth, "New Life" not only truly expresses reality and explains life, but also properly tells us how we should live and encourages us to move forward. For example, Bi Yuncheng in issue 49 tells us: "The attitude of doing things that is expressed by holding a decadent mentality is the most undesirable attitude of doing things"; "dissatisfied with reality and demanding progress", "but the methods adopted are clamorous and disorderly, and only show their temper", "this attitude of doing things that is expressed by holding a impetuous mentality", "is also not desirable"; "dissatisfied with the status quo, strive to understand the root causes of social ills", "strive to make the goal correct, and strive to understand the fundamental principles of human social survival and evolution", "This attitude of doing things that is expressed by holding a calm and struggling mentality", "is "worthy of being an example for ordinary people"! 丨丨This is indeed the right attitude to life, the right way of life.</p>
<p>Fifth, although the position of "New Life" is a scientific position, the language used to express opinions is very popular and interesting. There are no stiff "New Life Jargon" such as "opening up", "twisting", etc., nor are there upside-down Westernized phrases. All of them are very popular, lively, and generous articles. Among them, general essays, sketches, and life sketches are of course popular and beautiful, and even hard political and economic articles are extremely vivid and lively. For example, Mofu's "A Year-Long China Economic Tour" in issue 49 is a "hard" economic paper, but we can be very interested in reading it. The author did not use dry and tasteless statistical tables to explain China's economy in the past year, but used the suffering of farmers, the lives of workers, the situation of banks and shops, and the necessary figures to explain it, so that people feel that what is said in it has a major relationship with their own lives, which is completely different from the situation when reading those economic papers that specialize in using statistical tables to scare people.</p>
<p>Sixth, "New Life" is very responsible for general readers. Whenever her readers ask her questions, she can patiently and carefully give them proper explanations. I think the "Readers' Correspondence Column" of "New Life" is better than all kinds of small publications in the country: this may also be one of the main reasons why she can grab readers.</p>
<p>Finally, in addition to introducing "New Life" to everyone, we also hope that "New Life" will be further enriched in the future. In my personal opinion, "New Life" still lacks texts on the theories of various academics and the methods of studying social problems, and these kinds of things are currently urgently needed by ordinary young people in China, and the "New Life" that is loved by a wide range of readers seems to meet their needs.</p>

<h3 id="e308">Einstein's Biography (3) <a href="#e308" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c308" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">308</a></h3>
<p>— From Wood</p>
<p>At the beginning of 1903, Einstein married Mileva Marić, a former classmate from Zurich. At this time, his close friends included Besso, Maurice Solovine, and the young mathematician Konrad Habicht. These friends often spent entire nights at his home discussing scientific and philosophical issues. Sometimes, when they became excited, they would talk loudly, which disturbed others' sleep, often leading to disputes with him.</p>
<p>In 1904, his wife gave birth to a son, who was also named Albert. From this year, the most productive academic period of Einstein's life began.</p>
<p>During this time, apart from his service at the Patent Office, Einstein devoted the rest of his time to family matters and academic pursuits. This can be said to be the beginning of his profound research.</p>
<p>His earliest paper, published in the "Annalen der Physik" (one of Germany's leading academic journals for over a century), was the paper "On a Heuristic Point of View Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light," published in this journal in 1901. Subsequently, in 1902, 1903, and 1904, the journal published a total of four articles by him, all concerning thermodynamics, molecular theory, and the new statistical mechanics.</p>
<p>The four papers published in the "Annalen der Physik" in 1905 all have immortal value. They can be said to be epoch-making studies in the three different aspects that constitute physics. From then on, Einstein's academic position was established, but it still took time for the general public to recognize it.</p>
<p>Among these four papers, the first to be published, which appeared on March 17th, was the paper "On a Heuristic Point of View Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light." This was based on the so-called quantum theory of light, extending Planck's quantum hypothesis, derived in 1900 on the theory of thermal radiation, beyond thermal radiation to phenomena such as luminescence. It also records the basic relationship of the photoelectric effect, which was later widely used, the so-called Einstein equation.</p>
<p>The paper "On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in Stationary Liquids Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat," published on May 11th, discusses the so-called Brownian motion, based on his years of research in the molecular theory of thermodynamics.</p>
<p>Up to this point, Einstein's published papers were all about thermodynamics and molecular theory. The paper "On the Production and Transformation of Light" was also based on the consideration of the molecular theory of thermodynamics. However, the paper "On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies," published in June 1905, was completely different. This was about other fields of physics. Ten years later, he published his famous general theory of relativity, the precursor of what is now called the special theory of relativity. As for his fourth article, published in the "Annalen der Physik" in 1905, entitled "Does the Inertia of a Body Depend Upon Its Energy-Content?", it should be viewed as a continuation of the third article mentioned above.</p>
<p>In 1905, he also submitted a thesis to Professor Alfred Kleiner at the University of Zurich and obtained a doctorate. This thesis was published in the "Annalen der Physik" in 1906 under the title "A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions."</p>
<p>Because Einstein obtained a doctorate, Professor Kleiner felt it necessary to invite this excellent young scholar to the University of Zurich. However, he could not immediately become a university professor and had to work as a temporary lecturer. The income of a lecturer was not enough to support his family, so he was very embarrassed at the time. Fortunately, there was also a university in Bern, so he stayed in Bern, still maintaining his position at the Patent Office, while also serving as a lecturer at the University of Bern.</p>
<p>At that time, only two people were officially registered as listeners to Einstein's lectures. One was Besso mentioned above, and the other was Schapp, a young technician from the Telecommunications Bureau. Both of them were originally capable. However, it is regrettable that Einstein encountered such a situation in his first appearance. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e313">Dolores Del Rio's Way to a Happy Family <a href="#e313" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c313" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">313</a></h3>
<p>— Xilin</p>
<p>Dolores Del Rio's personal intelligence, calmness, bravery, and the fulfillment of her family life have become a well-praised story in Hollywood. When many young women among Hollywood stars encounter family changes and marital discord, they ask Dolores Del Rio for advice. Therefore, Dolores Del Rio is very qualified to say a few words about the issue of how to achieve a happy family.</p>
<p>Although she is not very old, she is a person with a rich mind and keen observation, whether in times of success or failure. Her commitment to building a happy family is also where she has thought and intelligence. She said: "Simply put, when you plan something, whether that thing is important or trivial, you always have to think about the possibility of failure, and prepare a secondary plan to maintain your position, to comfort you, and to encourage you after your first plan fails. That is the retreat you leave for yourself. No matter who or what, a retreat is indispensable."</p>
<p>Now let's take a very small thing as an example. For example, one night, you plan to go out for dinner and see a movie after dinner. Suddenly your friend, or your husband, comes back and obviously doesn't want to go out because he is tired. If you had left a retreat when planning to go out, preparing for the possibility that going out wouldn't be successful, then your disappointment would naturally be reduced a lot, and you wouldn't get angry.</p>
<p>This is a small thing, but the small can also be used to represent the big. More important things are also like this. Taking my personal life as an example, after I have gained many lessons from hardship and difficulty, I have also planned two major roads for my lifelong career. One goes to the right, and one goes to the left. If my work on the screen fails, I will retreat from the road on the right and turn to the road on the left. That road on the left is the road back to my family life. Although I have a considerable position on the screen, it is still not satisfactory, so I am also working hard on the road on the left to prepare my retreat. My family, my gardening, my way of life, and the life of shared joys and hardships with my husband are always in my consideration. Screen life used to be excellent for me. Once it disappoints me, I will retreat and return to my family, and I won't be heartbroken.</p>
<p>A female star, who can think about the future retreat when her career is at its peak, and devote herself to the arrangement of the family, thinking of it as a precaution, that kind of meticulousness in thought is worthy of our admiration.</p>
<p>But her thinking also has unique aspects, which are unattainable by ordinary romantic female stars. That is, she agrees that after a woman gets a husband, she must be able to keep her husband. Her method of keeping her husband is not like planning something, leaving a retreat in advance, so that if this man is not suitable, she can immediately retreat and change to another one. She said very politely that she,</p>
<p>is a Latin race person who grew up in an old-fashioned family. Although on the one hand, she admires the freedom of modern women to choose husbands and change husbands, her own mind is inevitably a bit old-fashioned. However, when losing a husband, although there is hope of changing to a new husband, there is also considerable pain. It is better to be able to keep him without losing him. The following are the methods of keeping a husband indicated by Dolores Del Rio:</p>
<p>Dolores said: "Of course, I can't say which thing is the most important, but generally speaking, a married person must remember that the marriage ceremony is not the end of something, nor does it give you ownership, so that you have a natural right to that thing without having to worry about losing it. On the contrary, all the things before the wedding must continue after the wedding. The way a man gets a woman is the same as the way a woman gets a man. How you get them is how you have to keep them. The way of courtship must continue after marriage. Tenderness, consideration, understanding, and romance are all indispensable after marriage as they were before marriage. Don't let romance die after marriage. Don't regard the relationship between husband and wife as something natural that doesn't need to be considered."</p>
<p>"Going a step further, after marriage, husband and wife should seek a stronger union. On the woman's side, she should be proud to be able to manage the family, and she should regard family life as a precious and great career. Furthermore, household expenses should be within the scope of income. Don't develop extravagant and wasteful habits. Debt is especially something that women should not do. The method of buying things and paying in installments is the dangerous beginning of debt, which will often make you feel uneasy. So, it's better to find ways to avoid it from the beginning."</p>
<p>"Furthermore, after a woman marries a husband, she has the responsibility of having children. Personally, when I am ready to have children in the future, I would rather give up my career and devote myself to raising my children. A child is worth the wholehearted care of any mother. With children, the family will be more complete, and the relationship between husband and wife will be deeper. In addition, to reiterate, you must leave a retreat everywhere. Gentleness and submission are the duties of women, although you don't necessarily have to rely on men. If you can do all of the above, the husband will not easily leave his wife."</p>

<h3 id="e314">Review of "Orchid in the Empty Valley" 丨 New Light Screening 丨 <a href="#e314" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c314" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">314</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Han</p>
<p>When films are used entirely as educational tools, film authors are by no means trying to cater to the audience, but are firmly grasping the audience's needs to improve their understanding. But when films are valued entirely from a business perspective, what the film authors want to do is to lower the standard to cater to the desires of backward people. Therefore, because Hu Die can still take the lead, and because people generally love ethical films, after "Sister Flowers" and "Rebirth Flower" came this "Orchid in the Empty Valley," in which Hu Die plays three roles alone. Moreover, this outdated ethical film was once a sensation in the silent film era.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether a bit of revolutionary history and the bright road are added to the front or the back, the characters and stories shown here are always bizarre, tortuous, and unreasonable. I don't understand why the character played by Gao Zhanfei would participate in the Northern Expedition? And why would he lead a noble life with nothing to do after the Northern Expedition? I also don't understand why the character played by Hu Die can live with her father? ····· Everything is an unreasonable hodgepodge, an unreasonable coincidence. However, because these are all so-called dramatic plots, plus two trains playfully colliding with each other, Liang Yan's mother appears as Mrs. Li Youlan, the so-called stepmother abuses the son of the former wife, and the biological mother sees her son suffering, the so-called ethical relationship that is hard to put together is like "Sister Flowers" and other films that provoke tears from the audience for no reason.</p>
<p>Speaking of the screenwriting and directing techniques of "Orchid in the Empty Valley," they are also not brilliant. The story is so long and expressed in such a tedious way. It doesn't have the story of a play, it's a tedious narration, and the places where there is a play to be made are not long enough. It can't be tightened a bit to show the artistic effectiveness of film drama. For example, the scene where Shen Jun, the child, cried out for his mother in front of his mother's remains was pulled so long that all the tragic emotion was destroyed. In addition, Hu Die's pursuit of Yan Yuexian, until she grabbed the medicine bottle and revealed her true face, also lost the tense atmosphere because it was too long.</p>
<p>Other things, such as Gao Zhanfei going home and the servant shouting "Young master is back," are also too lengthy. Plus, the interlude of Shuang Miyue and several songs are all superfluous because they are stiff, not to mention that the creation of the songs is so naive.</p>
<p>As for the actors, Gao Zhanfei's beard is as ridiculously fake as Wang Xianzhai's. However, the fact that he didn't know why Yan Yuexian would commit suicide, so why did he run so fast, proves that he was mostly tired by the director. Hu Die is still the same as before, without any progress. The better one is still Yan Yuexian, who is quite vivid. In addition, such as the stiffness of the dialogue, the lack of emotion when speaking each word, and the falseness and waste of the scenery, need not be pointed out one by one.</p>
<h3 id="e315">Review of "Congratulations on Getting Rich" <a href="#e315" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c315" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">315</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Kid Millions 丨 Great Shanghai Screening</p>
<p>Naturally, we can't say that an actor also has his own style, but some actors have many directors or screenwriters who make films for him. Eddie Cantor has always been the consistent lead in completely imaginary films that are lively and ridiculous in form, such as "Whoopee!", such as "Roman Scandals," all of which are like this, all the way to the current "Congratulations on Getting Rich."</p>
<p>We can't say that "Congratulations on Getting Rich" has no content. Its content is that a poor boy accidentally gets rich, which is ridiculous, allowing people to escape from reality into a dream world of fantasy. This effect is not accidental. Later, opening an ice cream shop teaches poor boys to eat their fill. Of course, this place is exactly where a large number of people who enjoy entertainment can go to have fun. During the New Year, amid the laughter of congratulations on getting rich, many people are laughing heartily because of this. Our evaluation of this film, in addition to explaining its business role, is that there is no way to find its film art value. As for studying its director or other technical aspects, we also have nothing to say. In fact, all aspects show its mediocrity, without any characteristics.</p>
<h3 id="e316">My Review of "New Woman" <a href="#e316" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c316" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">316</a></h3>
<p>— Zhengyan</p>
<p>We cannot but say that the film "New Woman" is realistic and a work above the horizontal line.</p>
<p>The playwright created three different women in this film, representing three different female archetypes in the current society: one is immersed in the evil habits of luxury and licentiousness, without sound thoughts and knowledge; one is although she has new thoughts, but in reality, she lacks rational judgment, which makes the environment hinder the road she should take, and makes her unable to extricate herself; one is who has a healthy physique, a firm will, and judgment, and can resolve to implement the "do".</p>
<p>Among the three women of these three different forms, of course, A Ying is the new female archetype of the current society in "New Woman". This is what we cannot deny as the author's kind of progressive thinking and a lot of painstaking enlightenment.</p>
<p>But in terms of the structure of the content, there are many places that I think still need to be discussed: for example, since A Ying is the new woman in this film, why is she portrayed so lightly here? At the same time, A Ying's courage and hard work should of course have her own kind of difficult situation, but this is also neglected here. Also, after Wei Ming took poison, the city newspapers published the news of her death, the bookstore manager held a memorial service for her, but she was sent to the hospital, and the doctor was able to clear her poison······ These are obviously inconsistent with the facts. There are other loopholes, but I won't point them out one by one.</p>
<p>Director Cai Chusheng is more regressive than "Song of the Fishermen". In terms of actors, Ruan Lingyu's expression is very moving, and Chen Sujuan's performance is also very talented.</p>

<h3 id="e317">Remnants of a Piece of Flesh (David Copperfield) (4) <a href="#e317" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c317" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">317</a></h3>
<p>— Willow Village</p>
<p>After David tearfully bid farewell to the Micawber family, he planned his escape. He suddenly remembered that his mother and Peggotty had mentioned he had an eccentric old aunt named Betsey Trotwood. That aunt had visited his home on the stormy night of his birth. He remembered she lived in Dover, and from what he'd heard, she was a very strange old lady, but regardless, she was still his blood relative and wouldn't treat him more cruelly than others.</p>
<p>Having decided on his plan, the young boy set out on a long journey, the experiences of which he would never forget. He was robbed, encountered violence, was beaten, had no bed to sleep in at night, and nothing to eat during the day. Finally, after enduring countless hardships, he arrived in Dover. Exhausted and hungry, he stumbled to his Aunt Betsey's house. His aunt listened in surprise as he recounted his short and miserable life. After listening quietly, she felt a pang of compassion. She and Mr. Dick, an equally eccentric distant relative, began planning David's future.</p>
<p>In the short time that followed, David began to feel some joy. His aunt, though her appearance was stern and formidable, was sincere at heart. She had a peculiar habit of hating donkeys. Anyone who dared drive a donkey onto the grass in front of her door would surely be scolded and chased away by her. Therefore, the children who drove donkeys were all afraid of her. But she not only scared away the children who drove donkeys, she also scared away Mr. and Miss Murdstone. They heard David was in Dover and came to take him away, but encountered this stubborn old lady and were humiliated and left.</p>
<p>From then on, David was forever free from the control of his stepfather, and through his aunt's efforts, he was sent to the home of Mr. Wickfield in Canterbury. He was a friend and lawyer of his aunt's. In the Wickfield household, he not only found a peaceful, lovely, and happy home, he also met a girl of similar age to play with. She was Mr. Wickfield's child, named Agnes. Her mother had died, and although she depended on her father, she often felt lonely and isolated. Therefore, David's arrival made them feel like they had known each other for a long time.</p>
<p>But within the Wickfield family, all was not without its pitfalls. There was a despicable little man there named Uriah Heep. He was the evil spirit in their lives, but David did not fully understand this at first, because he was too young to perceive Mr. Wickfield's weakness. Since the death of his wife, he had become addicted to wine. Uriah was a treacherous and scheming person. He had a humble appearance, but harbored sinister intentions. He gradually took control of Wickfield's business. Uriah was nominally Wickfield's student, studying law with him, but in reality, he overstepped the bounds of a student.</p>
<p>Although David did not know the extent of Uriah Heep's machinations, he felt a sense of disgust the moment he saw him. His hands were soft and clammy. His expression was excessively obsequious. His face gave him nightmares. His soft, damp hands seemed to be forever resting on his shoulders.</p>
<p>Year after year passed in this way. David had been sent to school to study. He soon became a handsome and elegant young man. He was also talented in writing and considered pursuing a career in writing. But he lacked one thing. He had no discernment, and he did not realize that Agnes loved him. If he had known sooner, perhaps Agnes would not have wasted away for him for so many years. He was now a grown man, and the world was unfolding before him. His eyes soon turned to London, and he abandoned the happiness he could have had without seeking it in his family home. (To be continued)</p>
