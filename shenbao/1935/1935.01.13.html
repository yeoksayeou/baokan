<h3 id="c18">中國之文化建設問題 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>有趕速多設研究院之必要</p>
<p>近來國内學術界。輿論界對於中國之文化建設。有一新覺悟。卽中國之學術文化有獨立之必要是也。如蔡元培王雲五任鴻雋諸先生分别於東方雜誌敎育雜誌上主張大學中創辦研究院。俾大學畢業生欲求深造者。不必爲遠涉重洋之留學。又如滬上學者王新命何炳松諸先生。則更在文化建設月刊上及本報敎育新聞欄發表宜言。主張「採人之長。捨人之短。」以中國爲三位。而謀文化之創造。此種覺悟。蓋爲前此所不常見。實中國思想界進步之徵象也。</p>
<p>海通以來。中國以歷受異族之侵陵。不僅對於其固有之文化。喪失其信仰。抑且對於其民族性之優秀與否。亦發生極大之懷疑。於是不知不覺間對於外人之一切。無不致其仰望崇拜之誠。而於其本身之智能力量。遂失却其應有之自信。精神上旣成他人之奴隷。則欲其有創造的能力。自爲南轅而北轍。實則。中國文化之發展。與西洋文化較。相距不及二百年。卽西洋之文化。已進於機械工業時代。而我則以過去閉關自守孤立遠東之故。其文化尙停滯於二工業與農業時代耳。至於精神文化方面。其相差實屬無幾。此爲社會學者文化史者所公認之差别。故我中國今日之落後。决非民族性劣敗之結果。乃爲歷史發展上一時偶然之相差。苟能保持相信。「迎頭趕去。」則無有不能趕及者。如彼東隣之日本。於六七十年前。有何文化可言。然於今曾幾何時。已與英美爭雄。可知肯自信而不自菲薄。必能奮發有爲也。故今後欲求中國學術文化之獨立與建設。必以自信爲關鍵。觀於近頃學術界之言論主張。覺其於此一點。已有明確之認識。此實大可慶幸之事也。</p>
<p>世界各國學問上思想上技術上之進步。日新而月異。以向來一切落後之我國。奔馳角逐於共間。猶有望塵莫及之歎。則欲謀學術文化上之獨立。固覺甚難。然苟能盡力推動。亦非絶無辦法。最顯然者。卽對於外來文化之吸收。（一）當視其是否切合於目今國家之需要。（二）當遵循犧牲最少收效最宏之途徑以進。我國歷來吸收外來文化。向以派遣留學生爲不二法門。學成歸國。社會注視甚高。其所處之地位。亦往往獨優。故數十年來。不論於任何方面。均視爲一種特殊階級。於是青年學子。莫不以能留學爲光榮。而於其個人之所學。是否切合國家當前之需要。則不暇置問。結果。國家所亟須者爲工業技術人才。而社會充斥者則爲文哲法政之人才。一方仍感缺乏。一方已覺過剩。可謂國家個人。兩受損失。再則。留學生中雖不乏眞欲出洋求學以謀世界文化之輸入者。然目的僅在混一頭銜者。實佔一大成分。卽以經濟上言。亦屬得不償失。蓋文哲政法等科。所要者爲書籍。有書籍則隨處可學。不必費十倍國内之金錢。遠涉生洋。然後爲學也。據最近敎部發表。我國海外留學生於過去數年内。其數約在三千七百人以上。而學文科者佔二千一百餘人。我人假定每一留學生於留學期間之費用爲一萬元。則外溢之金錢。卽達三千七百萬元之多。而文科學生所費者尤多於實科學生。以我國今日國際貿易之年年入超。現金之不絶流出。國民經濟。極度窘困。更何堪作此無計劃無統制之浪費哉。故我人於此。極盼國内各大學。速設研究院。或就現有之中央研究院。加以擴大。俾國内大學畢業生之欲求深造者。有所問津。同時務使研究社會科學之學者。不必出洋留學。而學理工等實科者。亦可將留學額數。减至最低限度。務使事實上非出洋不可者。始簡一二學有淵源之士。出洋學習。或作一短期之考察。如是則每年千百萬之金錢。可作各種研究所科學院之設備費。</p>
<p>旣有各種研究機關之後。　則學者研究實騐。從事發明。皆能得所憑藉。由是早夕於斯。經過要當時期。則學術上之發見。事物上機械上之發明。必能相隨而起。較之負販學術之留學政策。得失當不可以道理計。吾人敢信苟用此計劃。積以年月。必可使中國之學術文化漸進於獨立創造之境域也。</p>

<p>議决案雖不能公布、經記者探悉、當討論明興輪三公司反對加入滬甬綫時、招商局劉鴻生、曾提出主張、請三北將明興租與招商、三北方面、亦予允可、但因管理權問題、未能同情、遂又改議明興輪處理問題、結果、大致在「滬甬四公司規定仍各派航一船、不得再有添航」司派船代航、亟將概狀查誌如下、</p>

<p>儲匯總局亦定下月遷移</p>
<p>中央社云、本埠四川路橋郵政總局曁郵政儲金匯業總局、自奉交通部令飭遷京後、郵政總局業經分批開始遷移、本月二十日卽可全部遷移完竣、至於郵政儲金匯業總局、原定下月開始遷移、但以事實上之困難、恐亦未能如期遷竣、兹據儲金匯業總局副局長徐柏園氏談話如下、</p>

<p>徐氏語中央社記者云、關於該局遷至南京一事、交通部原定二月十日、須一律遷移就緒、惟在京局址、初擬於郵政總局所建房屋内劃出一部應用、現因該項房屋、均已支配他用、本局内部組織、規模較繁、故已無隙可撥本局應用、本局現擬在京另找適當房屋、以作局所、但迄今尙未找到、故在未找到前其遷移日期、似難確定、如能於最短期内、找得適當房屋、當可於二月内遷至首都辦公、</p>

<p>記者詢以該局對於投資農村情形、據答、本局對於投資農村、本所樂從、惟本局與銀行組織稍有不同之處、現在各銀行在内地分設支行、辦理農村投資、較爲便利、本局在内地多以委託郵政局兼理儲匯事業、事實上已極忙碌、當無閒再能顧及投資事業、如本局在内地設立專管投資機關、則亦爲經濟能力</p>
<p>所不及者、故本局對於農村投資一事、將來或與銀行合作、惟此事尙待計劃、俟計劃就緒後、方能進行、</p>

<p>錦順柯拉沙鮑沙列的是英雄</p>
<p>上海埠際足球隊試賽、於昨日下午三時在逸園舉行、悽風苦雨、景象蕭條、觀者僅三四千人、兩隊隊員、均按時到塲、不若往年之敷衍從事、惟球塲泥濘、奔馳較難、形勢雖未見十分緊張、但各球員均發揮技能、精彩非凡、十分滿意、上半時形勢平均、甲隊以二比一領前、下半時中乙隊内衛不能呼應、而甲隊前鋒如鮑沙列柯拉沙孫錦順三人、錦上添花、如虎生翼、聯絡美妙、屢建奇功、且射入部位巧妙、使史梅斯一籌莫展、誠觀止矣、結果甲隊以八比三大勝、兩隊陣綫如下、</p>

<p>兩隊陣綫、早經公佈、但戴麟經因傷缺席、軋許有意退隠、不願參加、已預定馮運佑及柯拉沙二人替代、鍾勇森臨時因故不到、由臘克斯老頭子哈脱培根出塲、雙方在雨絲風片中、由乙隊開球先攻、形勢頗爲平均、雙方互有攻門機會、均不得逞、更以事屬試賽、禮讓往來、毫無火氣、是以表演益見清晰美觀、球迷無不注意各個之表演、勝負反置腦後、如正式比賽能如此、則足球界可無意外之紛爭矣、</p>
<h3 id="c256">老孫連中 <a href="#c256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>甲隊前鋒殊見鋒鋭、乙隊因中徫綫實力稍薄、遂成爲多事之秋、孫錦順與柯拉沙鮑沙列互相呼應、恰到妙處、十分鐘時、孫錦順首開紀録、得自柯鮑二將之助、　在左内鋒地位打入、乙隊一度追擊、義臣家球均有攻門、或被救、或不中、在半小時時、甲隊福恩送出角球、球濕份量沉重、踢出不佳、被雪蒙斯頂出、但落於孫錦順脚下、老孫拉起鐵脚、一射入門、史梅頓手撲滑進、甲遂遂以二比零勝、</p>
<h3 id="c257">還敬一球 <a href="#c257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>繼之、老孫又得一機會射門未中、乙隊積極奮鬥、柯萊脱英勇無比、陳家球調度有方、哈脱培根高球送來、休脱頭頂失漏、柯萊脱亦以頭撞攻門、球彈横木落於門下、竟被柯克倫接住、李義臣再度深入、雷米狄窮追不及、二人追至門下、守門衝出救球、不意斜射裏阿爾傑趕上一脚、將球撥入門内、内隊乃拔回一城、未及中央開球、上半時時間已到、</p>
<h3 id="c258">下半時概况甲隊連捷 <a href="#c258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>下半時中、甲隊之表演、益見精彩、堪稱奇觀、故不得不濡筆伸紙、詳爲描述、以餉讀者、開球後、陳家球一次遥射甚急被救、甲隊前鋒龍　虎鬥、大露鋒芒、柯拉沙鮑沙列兼程殺進、孫錦順隨後策應、用高球挑過防綫、麥山兒頭頂未看、鮑沙列一掃中鵠、斯時形勢、全爲甲隊三前鋒之天下、萬象華屢造　會、福恩連開角球、惜未得利、乙隊一席深入休脱犯手球不罰十二碼、而轉眼之間、鮑沙列已單騎　至乙隊門前、射中門柱、反彈入門、史梅頓瞠目無策、成爲四一之比、</p>
<h3 id="c259">五一之比 <a href="#c259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>乙隊大挫之下、力圖進取、家球義臣極力與柯萊脱聯絡、阿爾傑邊疆怒射、可惜未中、鮑沙列心雄萬夫、縱横無阻、又射一球、被史梅頓妙救、博得采聲不少、鮑將軍虎視耽耽、捲土重來、單槍匹馬、如飛闖進、陳洪光隨後窮追、進至乙隊門前十二碼處、側脚斜射、又中鵠的、乃成五與一之比、乙隊至此、陣綫頗見不振、欲圖反攻、没奈何心有餘而力不足、更以射門不準、屢失機會、一次李義臣在門前六七碼處攻門、竟然一飛冲天、嘆惜之聲不絶、</p>
<h3 id="c260">拔回兩城 <a href="#c260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>甲隊雖威嚇一時、連連獲勝、但乙隊並不示弱、益足激發反攻之　心、哈脱培根老當益壯、邊陲起義、進至適當地點、遥送中央、柯萊脱迎頭頂去、一射入門、十分美麗、未幾、阿爾傑亦由邊綫抄進、直逼門邊、李寗衝上、二人互相跌地、不意球早被阿爾傑踢出、球勢甚緩、徐徐滾至球門綫上、安知守門柯克倫亦早經滑跌、即用手搭球、手指觸及而無效、球乃緩緩滾入球門綫内、可謂滑稽之至、乙隊異然連拔兩城、成五比三、</p>
<h3 id="c261">連中三元 <a href="#c261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>泰極否來、飛來横禍、史篤克犯手球、被罰十二碼、由孫錦順主踢、力道甚足、竟爲史梅頓泰然救出、采聲四起、乙隊喜出望外、柯萊脱帶球衝殺、闖至甲隊禁地、李寗見勢不佳、在後將柯絆跌、乃得脱險、然不罰十二碼球、實爲大幸、往後、孫錦順一次美麗之射門、史梅整亦用巧妙之手段救出、互查媲美、可謂奇觀、此後之五分鐘内、乙隊惡運臨頭、連負三球之多、誠屬罕有奇績、鮑沙列得柯拉沙來球、不及轉身、用脚跟倒踢、萬象華加上一脚射、柯拉沙遥射一球、擦門柱而進、未幾柯拉沙又建一功、造成三元、乙隊之負、罪不在史梅頓、由於内衛前衛之疏忽耳、而甲隊射門之神妙、實爲意想不到、遂使老於此道之史梅頓、束手無策、</p>
<h3 id="c262">球藝之總評兩員守門 <a href="#c262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>綜觀兩隊人員、尙稱平均、甲隊以平均見長、聯絡美妙、更以奔跑迅速、使對手大窘、乙隊方面苦不能連絡、前鋒遲鈍不城、漫無紀律、進至門下、氣勢反减、射門不佳、如鮑沙列柯拉沙孫錦順之脚頭、從未得見、之隊之最大破綻、在乎中衛線之軟弱、馬山兒史篤克兩内衛之不能呼應、史梅頓之守門、實不可以成敗論英雄、所負八球、實在無策挽救、柯克倫之守門、亦不下於史梅頓、表演均甚滿意、</p>
<h3 id="c263">内衛前衛 <a href="#c263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>軋許本年　有不願入選之意、故中堅之職、頗有材難之嘆、馮運佑似難當選、雪蒙斯亦不滿意、或者仍須起用、軋許、雷米狄與麥達之兩前衛、昨日表演殊佳、與梁樹棠陳洪光實不可比擬矣、内衛方面、李寗可無問題、史篤克料難入選、休脱與馬山兒、各有所長、惟休脱較爲硬壯、與李寗亦能合作、史篤克因近來主任西商中堅、允不充内衝矣、故不免跑出太遠、是以内部空虚、馬山兒獨木難支、乙隊之所以大敗也、</p>
<h3 id="c264">前鋒人材 <a href="#c264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>前鋒方面、右翼福恩不及鍾勇森遠甚、昨鍾雖不出塲、逆料鍾必爲理想中之右翼、哈脱培根徒然一夫之勇耳、左翼方面、萬象華當然勝過阿爾傑、但萬近日來之表演、頗少得意之作、當中三人、以昨日甲隊孫錦順柯拉沙鮑沙列三人觀之、海上再無有勝此三人者矣、主要點極能聯絡、以偶然之凑合、能得如此成績、實不容易、射門之佳、猶其餘事、確爲理想之人選、柯萊脱遠不如柯拉沙、李義臣遲慢而不能與人合拍、即射門等等、不及鮑沙列遠甚、陳家球當然不能搶奪孫錦順之位置、即以戴麟經而論、或者勝於柯拉沙、但决不能有如昨與孫鮑兩將之聯絡也、待二次試賽時、可再作定論、</p>

<p>兒童應該怎樣？</p>
<p>小朋友！今年已定名爲「兒童年」了，想你早已知道了吧！兒童年兒童自身應該怎樣呢？那麽揀緊要的説：</p>
<p>（一）鍜鍊身體，</p>
<p>（二）用功讀書；</p>
<p>（三）購用國貨；</p>
<p>（四）力行新生活。</p>
<p>上面所列的四條，希望每一位小朋友都能辦到，那麽非但你個人的前途有希望，連將來的國家也都有了希望！</p>
<h3 id="c273">朱文公的幼年 <a href="#c273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— 達齋</p>
<p>朱子名熹，諡文公，宋時人，文公五歲時讀孝經，就在書面上寫着:「不若是非人也，」因爲父親很有學問，所以跟着父親讀書，十四歲父親去世，始遵遺命從師求學，年十八，登進士第，文公有志學問，無意功名，秩滿便棄官歸家，問學於明師李侗，後來自已在白鹿洞講學，訂立學規，集理學大成，自來敎者學者，都認爲很有價值的，文公除講學外，又專心著述，所著的書籍很多，大多數是闡揚孔孟的道德，如四書集註等，後世的學者都奉他爲註經的正宗，他所著的語録，就是與現在白話文一般，使人看到容易懂得，又著楚辭辯正，對於文言詞章，也不偏廢的，現在文廟大殿内十二哲牌位，有一哲就是他，他雖是宋時人，距孔子很遠，因爲他的學問，不亞於當時賢弟子，所以將他特别加入，以示尊崇。</p>
<p>小朋友，要知道學校廢除讀經，是因爲經書在幼年的學生不容易領悟的緣故，但是經書自有經書的價值，並不是像洪水猛獸有那樣害人，這層是不可不明白的，白話文是取其普徧，至於文言文亦自有文言文的用途，不能一味抹煞，若是讀了敎科書就説經書無價值，懂得一些白話文就説文言文無用途，那就看錯了，試看朱文公小時有志照經書去做人，所以終成爲註經正宗，集理學大成，受後世崇拜，從小看大，有志竟成是多麽令人欽佩，他雖是提倡語體，却又長於文言，若是説文言毫無用途，在文公那時他早已反對，還肯去研究嗎？我並不是贊成讀經，又不是喜歡文言，不過告訴小朋友勿要誤會，也要學文公那樣立志去做人吧了。</p>
<h3 id="c274">鐵 <a href="#c274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— 眞</p>
<p>小朋友們，請你們想想看，我們日常的生活中，那一件東西是少得了鐵的。</p>
<p>衣：衣服是由機器製造的，那麽機器是什麽東西造成的呢？</p>
<p>食：我們吃的東西，不論是植物，動物，植物的葉綠素；動物的血素，裏面都有鐵質的存在。</p>
<p>住：我們住的房屋，鋼骨和一切釘子等附屬器，又是什麽東西製造的呢？</p>
<p>行：車子，輪船，是不是都有鐵的存在嗎？鐵是這樣的重要，我們怎能不注意呢？</p>
<p>小朋友們，你們以爲鐵是黑色的金屬。恰是相反，鐵實在是白色的，那麽黑色是什麽？那黑色就是鐵銹。</p>
<p>鐵是白色·堅硬·有光澤·有展性的金屬。在濕空氣中很容易生銹，尤其在人們所呼出的炭酸氣中。</p>
<p>鐵可分爲生鐵·熟鐵·鋼鐵三種：</p>
<p>一·生鐵·是硬而脆，所以不能搥打成形，並且没有展性和延性。什麽呌做展性延性呢：展性：譬如一塊生鐵，不能够打成一片薄片。延性：譬如一塊生鐵，不能够抽成一根絲。所以用生鐵來做成器具，必須預先做成一個模型，把生鐵澆進模型裏，才成一件器具。</p>
<p>二·熟鐵：是不硬而且是不脆的，有展性和延性。可以搥打成形。你看見過鐵匠打把刀没有？把一塊燒紅的鐵，你一搥，我一搥，的打着，不多時，就成一把刀了。熟鐵比生鐵容易製造器具。</p>
<p>三·鋼鐵：是很堅韌的，倘使雜質多了，也要脆硬的，鋼鐵的功用更大，什麽火車哪！輪船哪！彈簧哪！那一件東西不用鋼鐵？並且鋼鐵很有彈力性。</p>
<p>可惜得很，中國製煉鐵的工廠，規模很少，所以都依賴外國鐵，小朋友們！努力呀！將來我們去開辦全世界規模最大的煉鐵廠！那麽你可算爲一個有用的人了。</p>

<p>— 何公超</p>
<p>慶祝兒童年</p>
<p>民國二十四年的新年過了不久，科學先生又上台了。他手裏拿着一張白紙和一枝没有寫過字的新毛筆。他的助手還拿着三個小瓶，一瓶是鹼水，一瓶是醋，一瓶是石蕊水。</p>
<p>他一上了台，就向台下的小朋友們一鞠躬，説道：</p>
<p>「今年是「兒童年」，我向諸位小朋友祝賀，願諸位今年起，身體一天比一天强壯，學問一天比一天進步；對於科學知識，更加歡喜研究；我希望以了二十五年的新年裏，諸位的身體和學問，還要比今处勝過許多。現在我們來變把戲了」：</p>
<p>他把白紙鋪在桌上，用那枝新毛筆在鹼水瓶裏蘸了一下，提起筆來在白紙上寫了「慶祝」兩字；等它乾了，又蘸了些醋，接寫「兒童年」三個字，一會兒，這五個字完全者了，一點痕跡也没有留着，看去依舊是一張白紙。</p>
<p>他取出了一些石蕊水，加一點清水，含了一口。呌助手提起了白紙，把口裏的水，直向紙面噴灑過去，白紙上馬上現了藍色的「慶祝」兩字，和紅色的「兒童年　」三字。</p>
<h3 id="c277">慶祝兒童年 <a href="#c277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>眞好玩！於是臺下起了一陣掌聲……</p>
<p>「你們知道爲什麽會這樣的麽？原來石蕊水碰着了鹼性的東西，就要變做藍色；碰着了酸性的東西就要變做紅色。鹼是鹼性的一種東西，醋是酸性的一種東西；因此，把鹼水的醋寫字在紙上，就會現出紅色和藍色的筆劃來了。</p>
<p>「你們學校裏將要開游藝會嗎？你們何不把這套把戲表演給大家看－寫幾個字或畫一幅畫都可以。</p>
<p>「鹼和醋什麽地方買得到，你們只要问媽媽或姊姊就知道了；石蕊水是科學儀器館裏有得買的」。</p>
<p>試騐的工具：新毛筆一，白紙一。</p>
<p>藥品：鹼，醋，石蕊水。</p>

<p>— 君朋</p>
<p>我在上星期日，到一個親戚家去吃飯，在席間聽到一個狠希奇的事，就是「一千多人製成的糕」。</p>
<p>那親戚向他的兒子福岳説道：「我們等一會兒，就要吃糕了，這糕是一千多人製成的。」福岳露出詫異的面孔説：「父親！這糕要一千多人製成，想必一定要比那所房屋還要高大了！」我聽了也要覺得非常希奇。一刻兒糕果然來了，却是並不特别高大，是一種極普通的果子糕·福岳微笑道：「這就是嗎？你剛才所説的那塊糕，」父親説：「正是」！福岳接着説：「你不是説一千多人做成成的麽？」我們大家吃了一塊，父親帶着笑容道：「你現在到書包裏去拿石板，石筆，幫我計算這塊糕的工人罷！</p>
<p>父親説：「要做糕，先要磨粉，粉是米磨成的，米是從榖舂出來的，稻的果實是榖，是農夫耕種得來的，你想，不是已經好多人了？耕種必須犁，犁必須鐵匠木匠，製粉必須磨子，磨子必須石匠，這裏又要好多人了；果子是從遠處運來的；種果子的；販賣果子的；統計起來又要好多人了；同時，蒸糕要用煤來燒；礦工開出鐵來，再由製鐵鍋的人製成，又在蒸糕時，要用布襯下面，所以種棉花的；紡織的；製布機的；不知又要加上多少人呢？父親説到這裏，那很聰明的他的兒子福岳説，「好了，好了，父親，我已經算到一千多人了。」　　小朋友！你們看了相信這糕確要一千多人嗎！我們要知道我們吃了一塊糕，好不容易啊！</p>
<h3 id="c279">人體中幾個有趣的數字 <a href="#c279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— 長素</p>
<p>人體中的骨骼，總計有二百十枚，其中頭顱骨共佔二十八枚，軀幹骨共佔五十二枚，四肢骨共佔一百三十枚；小孩子的還不止此數，要增多九枚，因爲有些有成年時要併合的。</p>
<p>大腸和小腸的總長，約有二丈五尺，小腸已佔五分之四，大腸僅五尺左右。成人的牙齒總計三十二枚，門齒（俗稱門牙）共有八枚，犬齒，（俗稱虎牙）共有四枚，小臼齒共有八枚，大臼齒共有十二枚；至於小孩的乳齒，七八歲時便都更換，計有二十枚。</p>
<p>男子在深呼吸時，空氣出入的量，約在三千立方公分左右，平常呼吸時，約在五百立方公分左右，普通女子呼吸的量，都比男子的少。</p>
<p>心臟當正常狀態時所湧出的血液，每分鐘約二加倫，（每加倫等於三·七八市升，）每時有一百二十多加倫。血管中血液所流動的速度，每秒二英尺，每時約七英里，每天約一百六十八英里。心臟的跳動，每分鐘平均七十三次，每時約四千三百二十次。看了這些數字，太驚人了！</p>
<h3 id="c280">留聲機 <a href="#c280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— 火生</p>
<p>小朋友，我們在空閒的時候開開留聲機器，不是很快樂的嗎？但是要曉得發明留聲機器的人是怎樣的努力，纔有今日的成績呵！</p>
<p>誰都知道，留聲機器也是愛迭生發明的。他初發明的時候，很不完備；他的工人聽見他説，他所預備的一種機器裏面，能發出人聲，以爲他老先生故意和他開玩笑，没有一個人信他，那裏知道愛迭生竟用了十年的工夫，把各人所不信的留聲機，弄得完完全全，貢獻於世；有一次，他竟因改進留聲機器，一連五日夜没有睡覺，一口氣的工作下去！</p>
<p>這樣看來，天下那裏有「不勞而獲」的好事情？</p>
<h3 id="c281">兒童科學講座植物葉子的奇妙 <a href="#c281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— 林蔭</p>
<p>你也聽見你們的敎師説過植物會呼吸的話嗎？你們也許要懷疑，只有動物有　有鰓以營呼吸作用，難道植物也會有肺有鰓不成？不，植物的呼吸作用是由於葉，葉的葉綠體。你要是不信，我們可以試騐一下來證明，你把植物的葉子拿來盛放在一隻玻璃杯裏，再用紙蓋蓋起來，以防外面空氣的流入，這樣過兩三個鐘點以後，你如把紙捻燃着火放進杯子裏去，那火就會立刻熄滅。（圖一）這就可以明白植物的葉子把杯中的養氣吸收進去，杯裏全是炭酸氣，所以紙捻的火就不能再燃着了。</p>
<p>我們知道，植物的重要養料是水，一株植物將要枯萎的時候，只要澆些水上去，它就會復活起來。水分過多的時候，却由葉蒸發出去。植物的吸收和蒸發作用，正和我們人類呼吸相同。我們再拿剛才用過的玻璃杯和紙蓋，再來試騐一下葉的蒸發作用，你把玻璃杯裝了水，把紙蓋穿個小孔，再摘一瓣植物的葉子揷在紙蓋孔裏，讓葉柄浸在水裏，另外又拿一隻擦得很乾的玻璃杯罩在下面，（圖二）過十幾分鐘以後，把玻璃杯揭開來看，剛才擦乾的杯子，此刻已經潮濕，像有人呵過氣一般。你可明白杯裏的水份那裏來的嗎？我想，聰明的小朋友！一定會回答，這是葉子從紙蓋下面吸了水而蒸發出來的。</p>
<p>植物的葉子最奇妙的，還會防止敵害，像動物有自衛的爪牙一樣。我們平常看見的仙人掌，它的葉就像針刺一樣，枸骨的葉，邊緣都生成尖鋭的刺形，（圖三）你手一觸着它，就覺得痛，這樣就可以避免人家來傷害它了；另一方面，盡保護的責任，帮助新芽從堅固的地面上　鑽出來，像筍葉一樣。葉在植物中，眞像我們人類的四肢的作用一樣。你想它們是多麽聰明啊！</p>

<p>— 心青</p>
<p>我留在那裏爲了我的生命奮鬥，一日夜中攀住了那塊木，因此不曾沈下去，我以爲我只有短時間可以活命了，但是第二天一個良冲到我一處小島的灘上，因爲乏食之故，已疲乏極了。</p>
<p>這海岸上的岩石是很峻峭的，要不是那樹根和旁的植物的根給我立足，那我决没有這機會攀登上去，達到海浪冲不到的所在。</p>
<p>我喫了些找到的草本，又在一處清潔而新鮮的泉流中喝了些水；於是我動身走去，瞧可能發見些甚麽。</p>
<p>去我略遠的所在，見有一頭馬，我便走將過去。那馬是一頭良畜，我立着瞧了半晌。</p>
<p>一會兒我聽得一個聲音，一人挺立在我的面前。他説；「你是誰？」</p>
<p>我旣將我這悲慘的境遇告訴了他，他就帶我到一個洞中。我在這裏瞧見更有許多人。他們給我飲食，我兩樣都喜歡。他們對我説，他們是島王梅勒奇的侍從。我瞧這當兒恰好能同他們到市鎭中去，去這裏是有些遠的。</p>
<p>倘不是這班人我可就死了。没有他們的幫助，我可也找不到路到那島中人民居住的一部分，而那些侍從到這所在來，一年也不過一次罷了。</p>
<p>第二天我們就動身到這島中的首鎭去，到了那邊他們就引我去見他們的島王。他説道：「你是誰？又怎樣到本地來的？」</p>
<p>我旣告知了他，他吩咐他的手下人，關於衣食和金錢凡是我所需要的，都供給我。</p>
<p>我如今所居住的鎭是海邊一個港口，從世界各地駛來的船隻，在這裏都可瞧見。</p>
<p>日子一天天過去，我在近海一帶消磨了很多的時光，因爲我想也許有一艘船是從我故鄉來的，或能聽聽巴克達的新聞，或去覓一艘小船載我回去。</p>
<p>梅勒奇王有一個島稱爲甘瑟爾島。我曾有一次到過這島上，見那邊有很大的魚，有的竟長至一百尺以外。我又見有的魚郤不到二尺長，它們的頭像梟一樣。</p>
<p>一天有一艘大船進來，此船一繫住了纔，那水手們便着手將所有的貨物一起從艙中取出來。</p>
<p>我立在一旁瞧他們工作，試想我何等的快樂，郤見有幾個包子上竟標着我自已的姓名。這些貨物正是我從白爾沙拉動身時帶出來的。</p>
<p>我告知船主這些東西是我的，他先還不讓我領取，他説道辛白德是死了，我定是一個騙子。</p>
<p>他説：「對你瞧時，人家總以爲你是一個良善而誠實的人。但我曾見辛白德死的，那大魚泅水時，把他直帶到大海深處。如此你怎樣會是辛白德呢？在我覺得你所説的事情全是假的。」</p>
<p>我説：「倘你肯好好的聽我説來，我想定可證明於你。我即是你所以爲眼見得沈下海底去的辛白德。」</p>
<p>於是我把一切經過告訴他！我如何被海浪冲擲在岸邊，遇了島王的侍從，便帶我上朝去。</p>

<p>紐約一月十一日電告一週棉市狀况云、本週棉市狀况尙穏、漲風起後、南方售出稍多、而跌風爲國外與國内同業收買遏制、投機家欲待華盛頓新進展、尤注意於彭海德案之限額、與一九三五年政府放出棉債之政策、故目前興趣不濃、一般商業愈形樂觀、但購者不欲多儲棉花、蓋以南方售出、爲數不少、在現在價格上、定以饜滿目前需求也、紐約與利物浦兩處棉價、相差愈大、國外可與美棉競爭之外棉、其市價更堅之説、乃愈可信、於是此間價稍跌時、與國外有關之商家即購進不已、農部估計一九三四年世界各種棉花産量共爲二千六百萬包、每包重四七八磅、較上年减三百十萬包、本週棉布市况平靜而堅穏、</p>

<h3 id="c328">孟姜女的還魂 <a href="#c328" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e328" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">328</a></h3>
<p>— 應申</p>
<p>歷史上是否眞有孟姜女這样一個人，還成問題，不過秦始皇築萬里長城這回事大概是靠得住的。秦始皇强迫人民服工役，人民犧牲在他暴政下當何止孟姜女（作爲有這樣一個人）的丈夫一人？爲此項暴政所造成的寡婦又何止孟姜女一人？在那個時候，不消説有許多的慘劇發生，爲什麽光是孟姜女一個人出了名呢？這就有點怪。我們從孟姜女的歌謡中可以看出孟姜女主要只是作爲一個烈婦而被人傳誦，而且還可以説是以善哭而得名；本來照這樣一個人物是不配「不朽」的，然而數千年來人們一直唱着她的名字。因此，我們很可以有權利作這樣的懷疑；所謂孟姜女是後代統治者按照了自已的模型而塑出來的一個人物。因爲傳説中的孟姜女，對於統治者羣，不但不含有危險性，正相反，她是很合統治者胃口的理想人物。而是被封建社會所表揚的。</p>
<p>然而現在孟姜女竟然還魂丁！「濟南快信」告訴我們，濟南來了一個「濟南孟姜女」（實在她自陜西來，照例該説陜西孟姜女，但是濟南的記者一定要跟她認老鄉，引爲榮耀！）韓桂卿，「千里尋夫，矢志不折。」記者先生僅僅將「事跡之厓略，記之如左，」就是上萬字！口氣中還極盡其推崇之能事。准我掉句文，「這不是偶然的」。現在産生這種孟姜女的條件，又凖備着了。隨着封建意識的抬頭，孟姜女的得以還魂，實在不是怪事，</p>
<p>現在就讓我們來認識認識這位「濟南孟姜女」罷！她「不遠千里」而投奔的未婚夫孫德福，是被豪紳李寳慶壓迫到流落在濟南當乞丐的。而現在豪紳地主的跋扈是普遍而且是經常的現象。照例，一個在報紙上被記者大吹大擂地稱揚的女子，應當是一個和豪紳地主及産生豪紳地主的制度作英勇鬭爭的戰士，但我們的「濟南孟姜女」呢？她的所以成爲「濟南孟姜女」者，只是因爲她堅抱嫁女不吃兩家飯的决心，投奔她「因係舊式婚姻，非自由戀愛而成，故見面尙屬陌生」的未婚夫孫德福！要是她和孫德福確有愛情，彼此深知，她此種舉動尙不失爲一員消極地和封建勢力不合作的勇士。然而竟進這一點也談不到！</p>
<h3 id="c329">「見笑於封建遺孽」何傷！ <a href="#c329" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e329" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">329</a></h3>

<p>讀郁達夫先生的「中國婦女應上那兒跑」後</p>
<p>去歲大旱之年，簇生了許多婦女刊物；今年可望風調雨順，這類刊物，當更如雨後春筍。新正第一日，便復興了停頓多時的婦女旬利。内容壓卷第一篇，是郁達夫「中國婦女應上那兒跑」的名文，現摘録幾段如下：</p>
<p>「照現在中國的情形來看，完全把家庭丢去，似乎是不可能的。而婦女的職業，又不見得十分多。况且大學畢業的男子，尙且在這裏嘆就職難，更何况乎一般的女子。」</p>
<p>「我的意思，……也許嫌太舊一點，……獨身成年的女子，應該離開家庭；已婚的婦女，還應該先顧到家庭，……况且中國的封建制度，還没有完全打倒：若一小家庭的主婦，（大家族中之已婚婦女，當在例外）不顧家庭而跑了出去，致使男人不得不受育兒治家之累，豈非將見笑於封建的遺孽？」</p>
<p>依郁先生的高見，婦女總以不跑開家庭爲是，如在男子没有了「就職難」之嘆之後，有兩種女子，似乎可以從事職業，即：</p>
<p>（一）獨身成年的女子。</p>
<p>（二）大家族中之已婚婦女。</p>
<p>而有一種女子，他以爲絶對不可從事職業，即：</p>
<p>小家庭的主婦。</p>
<p>對這高見我想試一試螳臂當車。請向：</p>
<p>（一）社會進化的過程，婦女應不應由家庭踏入社會？</p>
<p>（二）依現狀，男子的「就職難」有不有解决的日子？婦女可不可以等到那時再尋找職業！</p>
<p>（三）大家族存在於封建社會，婦妇爲了職業，是不是要恢復大家族制度？</p>
<p>（四）怕見笑於封建遺孽的人成了甚麽模樣？</p>
<p>（五）除了少數人而外，現在有幾個可以叫婦女去治理的安寗的家？</p>
<p>我敢回答：要社會進化必須婦女同了男子，通通加入社會；要婦女回到家庭即是進化的魔障。中國社會，只有男男女女，恊力同心地奮鬥，才有一綫生機；若用封建遺毒，將婦女關住，男子的「就職難」根本在現社會下怕無解决之望。至於大家族制度，已隨封建制度變了僵屍，婦女如要走入那一境也就無須乎再談職業。要尋職業的已婚婦女，大抵是那些六親無靠的小家庭或者有獨立性的人物。這種人叫她不就職業，不是斷了她的生活，就是毁了她的志操，結果還是累了社會。</p>
<p>况且目前社會有幾個安寗的家？先生們只是呌婦女回到家庭，到不如乞丐回到客廳來得簡明暢快。家庭旣已不蔽風日，婦女不給以正當的職業，當然只有躑躅街頭；還有甚麽風化，秩序，安全可講呢？</p>
<p>男子始終在家庭要維持他受供奉的尊嚴，是之謂封建遺孽！爲了這些遺孽，許多婦女抛棄了社會的任務，許多婦女更傷心地墮入了呢坑！</p>
<p>封建遺孽已經成了不堪掛齒的東西。站在男女互助的觀點上，在可能範圍以内，小家庭的男子，便担任一點治家的工作，見笑於封建遺孽，請問有過聲譽的郁先生，又有何傷？</p>
<h3 id="c330">談談日本的婦女雜誌 <a href="#c330" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e330" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">330</a></h3>
<p>— 南如</p>
<p>日本究竟是個文化水凖比較高一點的國家，雖然在不景氣的年頭，而各種雜誌，却是如雨後春筍般蓬勃。婦女雜誌也很多，比起中國來，至少要多七八倍，婦人公論，主婦之友，婦女界，婦人之友，婦人畫報，婦人俱樂部，少女俱樂部，這些都是最有名的月刊，但内容幾乎完全一致是供給資産階級的婦女們看的。比方主婦之友和婦人俱樂部簡直是養成賢母良妻的惟一讀物，裏面的文字，不是婦女應該如何地服從丈夫，體貼丈夫，便是如何地撫養孩子，招待客人，料理家務，做個温柔能幹的主婦，讀這些刊物的人，自然太太們佔最大多數，然而也有不少的未婚少女買來凖備做太太讀的，她們的思想，不用説，是絶對地主張男子治外，女子治内的，她把自已看做丈夫的妻子，兒女的母親，她的任務是侍候丈夫，服從丈夫；生兒子，撫養兒子，其他社會的知識，她並不需要，因此刊物的内容便成了家庭的了。</p>
<p>婦人公論的性質，倒有點和中央公論相彷彿，有時中條百合子也在這兒寫點東西，説幾句帶有刺激性的話，以期喚醒比較覺悟一點的婦女羣衆，但效果也是微乎其微的，因爲整個的刊物都是這麽一套賢妻良母主義，你雖然呌破嗓子，也只有少數人能聽到的。</p>
<p>和上面這些刊物處在對立的地位的，有婦人文藝，女性文化，和女人藝術社出版的「輝」。</p>
<p>這三個都是月刊，婦女界的文化雜誌。但「輝」的篇幅很小只有半張報紙這麽大，可是上面的文字都是短小精悍帶有社會的實際性的。編者是一位與菊池寛齊名的長谷川時雨。中條百合子，神近市子，平林泰子，窪川稻子這些前進作家，也常擔任撰稿，這刊物在三年前，名女人藝術，厚厚的一册，内容很豐富，我曾經看過三期的，因了某種關係，已經停刊很久，但據長谷川氏説，明年一月或二月總有恢復的可能。</p>
<p>婦人文藝，算是思想前進的惟一婦女讀物。編者是神近市子，一個有名的前進作家。從去年七月發刊到現在，每月出一厚册，從未間斷過。裏面的内容有文藝理論，文藝批評與介紹，創作小説及詩歌，問答，研究等等，注重下層婦女解放的理論和創作。</p>
<p>這刊物，是日本前進的女作家惟一發表言論的雜誌，所以内容非常豐富，讀者特别多。最初發行時，經濟有點感到困難，但現在因爲定閲者和購買者一天多似一天，這問題早已不成問題，神近市子説：「這刊物是屬於東京，屬於至世界的被壓迫婦女的，無論環境惡劣到怎樣地步，我們也要繼續着奮鬥。而且更希望國際的女作家，和我們共同努力！」</p>
<p>一九三四，十二，二十五於東京。</p>
<p>對於女人，只能等於裝飾品嗎？我問。</p>
<h3 id="c331">兩重代價的婦女職業者 <a href="#c331" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e331" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">331</a></h3>
<p>— 一芸</p>
<p>將自已的勞力出賣給别人，從别人手裏換取工錢或薪水來養活自已，這就呌做職業者。所以在現社會從事職業活動，在被雇用的條件之下，不管是從事何種職業，總是要付一份代價的，這代價一般説來就是勞力。</p>
<p>出賣一份勞力，獲得一種職業以謀生存，雖是一般的現象，可是在歷史上婦女却很不容易得着這種機會。所以幾千年的人類史，婦女是被男子豢養着的，她們雖有勞力無處換取一種職業，這算是婦女在受壓迫，没有得着解放的結果。到了近代，婦女是可以在社會上來賣勞力從事職業了，一般歷史家和社會問題研究家，把這種現象稱爲婦女解放的事實之一，這也是確是對的。因爲婦女由此得着經濟獨立，參與社會經濟事業的機會，由家庭的人變成社會的人了。</p>
<p>但是，　現代的婦女職業者，特别是中國的婦女職業，雖然已經逐漸可以在社會上從事職業活動，然而却有一部分職業，婦女們是不能和男子一樣，只須支付勞力一重代價就可以獲得的。她們經常地是要比男子多付一重代價，即在除支付勞力以外，還要支付一重肉體的色相代價，所以我把這種職業叫做兩重代價的職業者。</p>
<p>這種兩重代價的職業者，暫時我們把機關中的女職員略而不談，因爲雖然有人説她們只是當了「花瓶」，很少支付勞力，但她們畢竟是較高等的人，我們不方便這樣説。另外還有一種，就是各種遊藝塲的女招待與賣歌者。她們雖是在招待客人和賣唱的條件下，支付過勞力，但同樣也是要支付一份色相代價，才能將那種職業幹得下去。不過對這種婦女我們也略而不論，因爲她們雖然是爲生活逼得不得已才去幹那種職業，可是社會的一般觀點，都認爲那種職業是比較下流的，不好拿來算在正當職業之例。</p>
<p>大家都知道，各種公司和商店，是堂皇尊嚴的偉大營業機關，是一切都市中的經濟命脈與中心之一。在那裏服務的人們，雖不很高也不很低，至少算得中庸的正當自由職業者了。所以在那裏服務的女職員，是稱作名正言順的店員，誰也不能去説她們的這樣那樣。然而，實際上，這些商店裏的女店員，仍然是很可憐的，獲得那種職業同樣不能如男子一樣，只付一種勞力的代價就够了。她們同樣要在終日忙碌，取貨，寫賬，算賬的本務之外，在支付勞力之外，另外還須支付一份色相代價，這是不管她願意不願意的。</p>
<p>我們到那些公司裏去看，所有的女店員，都至少有中等以上的姿色，地都是塗粉抹脂，矯態迎人的，未必以偌大的上海，就没有中等色貌以下的婦女嗎？何以那些商店内竟没有一個呢？未必她們的收入，個個都很豐富嗎？何以竟都能打扮得像闊太太一樣呢？這很明顯，公司和商店原來就是要利用她們來做招牌的，不年青，不美麗，不好裝飾的，便不能招攬雇主，没有招攬生意的魔力，則她自然在淘汰之列了。如此，那些色相不足的婦女，不肯拚窮命去裝飾趨時的婦女，就不能獲得那種員業。所以不但要那些女店員以低聲下氣的態度對雇客，而且也歡迎一切輕薄的雇客趨之若騖，公司的營業才有可觀。這在公司，女店員和雇客的各方面，都爲這種不正的社會心理所决定，是没有辦法的。可是這種心理與現象，充分地表現出以婦女作玩物的男性中心社會思想，婦女何嘗得着與男子同等的職業，何嘗得着澈底的解放！</p>
<h3 id="c332">婦女失學救濟所一瞥 <a href="#c332" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e332" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">332</a></h3>
<p>— 茜</p>
<p>因着好奇心與求知的念頭，我一連跑了好幾個婦女補習學校，但它們給我的印象，可説太漠糊而又太清晰了。</p>
<p>首先，我們來講講在上海已有兩三年歷史，學生很興旺，而不久以前，又設了一分校的某婦女補習學校罷。一個陰而冷的天，我走進了某校本店的會客室，那是很講究的三層樓洋房，會客室的上端，巍巍然蹲着一架大洋琴，一個穿皮大衣的中年女郎，正在用鑰匙開琴。客室右壁放着一條待診室用的那種長椅子，椅上坐着一個少女在繡花；左壁便是兩座玻璃書橱，橱内除了幾本字典，辭源，和兒童世界之類的書籍以外，便良友畫報，時代畫報，中華畫報，電影畫報，那麽多的封面美人琳璫滿橱，彷彿是在那先舉行美人競賽似的。</p>
<p>因爲要等我的朋友上完課，我不得不儘呆在會客室裏，襄那五綫譜尙未認清的彈奏往我滿耳朶裏鑽。可是就在這時間内，我讀熟了牆是的統計表。據表上告訴我，學生的職業：商估百分之六十，軍政百分之二十，醫學界及其他百分之十五，工佔百分之五。我以爲在此，尙應當證明一句，上列的職業統計，並不是學生們本身的職業，百分之九十五，是她們的家長或保護人的職業。至於學科方面，則分有國，英，算，刺繡，縫紉，音樂，和簿記等科。當我的眼剛到學生籍貫統計表上時，外面突然進來了一個拿羢毯的包車夫。没過一會工夫，内在就走出了一個摩登而闊氣的太太模樣的女人，在她和那彈琴的中年女郎打過招呼後，彈琴女郎便鎖好琴，和她手挽手上包車去了。不久，一陣鈴聲響來，我的朋友也出現在客室裏了，我遂和她一同上樓，到了她們的寢室。</p>
<p>寢室的六張床，都是靠牆一順排起的，在離房門外不遠，有一個長的木面盆桌，加相擺着無數的面盆，房中央，一連擺着三張檯子，是供學生們自修習字等用的書桌。這三張書桌，説來好笑：一張是尺多寛二尺五寸長的没有抽屜的小條桌，桌面黑一塊白一塊，比人家灶間裏放碗橱的桌子還要難看；另一張，大小與第一張無二，但它在外表和實習上，還算得是一張小書桌，這書桌上，一位頭髮燙得很講究的女士正在用功；第三張書桌，那就只有天曉得，一張有抽屜的方桌，式樣還是中國二三十年前的道地國貨，油漆差一點没脱光，露出來的木料顔色，因年久拂拭的結果，已變成一種自有的褐黄色。這三件古董，便是那寢室内六個住堂生日夜預備功課的地方。至於頭上的燈光，那就只有一盞昏暗暗的二十五隻燭的電燈</p>
<p>講到取費方面，某校簡章和我朋友的實情是這樣：每修一科，取費十元，住堂生，每月另收宿費八元，膳費八元。在改課卷方面，國文科，每天有日記，可是不知怎的，國文敎員不上兩月，換了三個。初習作文的人，敎員竞不代爲修改文句，只改改錯字，而且有些别字，還一而再地讓那可憐的老大學生繼續使用下去。</p>
<p>因爲第一次參觀的不滿意，第二天，我便向着異軍突起的另一婦女補習學校出發了，這一天我是伴着另一位女友去上課的。因爲時間不早，我的朋友一走進學校，便領着我向她樓上敎堂裏跑，沿途經過了一間敎室，敎室的門半開着，我看見裏面坐着兩個女人，大概是學生，另一個在地上踱方步的，想是先生罷。她們都穿的是綢緞毛皮，像等喜酒吃的太太們。</p>
<p>且看脸走，我已到了樓下的會客廳。在做着琴房兼閲覽室的客廳裏，一位頸上披狐的二十七八歲的女郎，又在那兒做着剛認五綫譜的工夫。望着她那欲速成的焦燥以及那像彈風琴樣的指法，我是如何地想勸她，抛開那種裝飾，去學點旁的有用的學問，哦！可惜，我不認識她！</p>
<p>這兒，因夜間有另一批人在此上課，所以陳列的書報都是很進步的。當我正耽讀一篇文章時，辦公室裏走出了一位女辦事員，她狠狠地望着我上下打量了好幾分鐘，方轉身回辦公室去了。於是我像照過鏡子似的，忙把視綫收回來，向自已身上打量着。滿以爲穿得很整齊的我，這時在他山攻磋之下，方覺悟自已活像一隻醜鴨子，一件大衣，不但舊，而且材料與式樣都太過於時代落伍，一雙破皮鞋，簡只像　三穿的。在歸家的路上，我想到了那些連舊大衣破皮鞋也没有穿的窮基的失學婦女們。學</p>
<h3 id="c333">「社會人」自述 <a href="#c333" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e333" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">333</a></h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>兩星期家庭敎師的生活</p>
<p>幾交尋找職業的碰壁</p>
<p>眞正「社會人」的認識</p>
<p>總集社會的風習的種種壓迫，父母的監視，丈夫兒女的拘囚，我轉變成爲一個社會的人，曾經是怎樣戰鬥才完成的，那是過去的事了。</p>
<p>最有趣的，一九三０年之夏，失業的狂浪，把我從安徽捲到了上海。那時候，眞窮得可笑，吃飯是寄食於朋友身上，而在朋友附近找到一個住處，四壁都是水門汀，因爲牠並不是亭子間，而是一個不曾安設浴盆的洗澡間吧了。一張帆布床，三隻箱子，佈置得還明潔小巧，只可惜没有桌椅，却引起二房東的疑慮，時常用偵刺的目光送我出去，用輕忽眼睛迎我回來。</p>
<p>申報自我職業介紹欄，我每天用最大的注意去讀牠但是兩個禮拜了，還找不着一件適於我的職業。有時候，我上我父親的朋友家裏坐坐，華責的沙發，虚僞的酬酢，我非常感到陌生；一看到客堂後面那些等候職業的可憐虫，一種難堪的莫可奈何的表情，使我的心便緊促起來；我懷着我的失望的心，又蕩着馬路歸來。</p>
<p>炎熱漸漸消退了，秋蟬噪咶樹梢，一天下午，我父親的這個朋友來找我。他説：</p>
<p>×軍長三個孩子，你去敎敎吧，薪水雖只六十元，每天却只史地和算術三個鐘頭，國文和英文，另外有男先生擔任，不過，×軍長要女先生必須能住在他家裏，便於隨時照顧孩子。—我想，這於你没有甚麽不可以吧？」</p>
<p>當然，我是得答應，　×軍長也正是我父親的朋友。</p>
<p>這個家庭的生活是非常驕奢淫逸的。老爺是下台的軍長，每天吞雲吐霧的一榻横陳；家務有太太管領；消愁解悶有兩三個年輕的姨太太；在家有奴婢，出門有保標的汽車，有的是洋錢，甚麽隨他意之所欲能够得到滿足的。</p>
<p>可是我，這簡直是人間地獄。敎課雖只三個鐘頭，驕縱的孩子們乃是那麽低能的；而課外的我，却又得和太太談天，陪太太們玩牌，漫無止境的消費我的時間，時常到疲憊的深夜；我完全不能讀一點書，做一點我自已的事。</p>
<p>我眞憤恨自已：「我的全部時間，只值六十元的代價嗎？「玩物喪志」我爲甚麽要多此一舉走出家庭？走吧，這裏决不是我解决吃飯問題的地方！」</p>
<p>於是，兩禮拜光景，我再不能留下去了，我堅决的走出這個罪惡的深洞。</p>
<p>回到眞正的亭子間裏，才恢復我眞正的人形，又非常清醒生活起來。一天，發現報上有個音樂公司招請職員。職員的資格是對於樂理有基礎知識，和曾經敎過音樂的。這，我認爲我滿有把握的；我馬上寫了一封應考信去，雖然待遇僅只三十元。</p>
<p>三天回信來了。跟着這封回信，我走進一個廣大的舞廳，裏面坐着三四十個，鶯鶯燕燕花枝招展的青年女子。我注神一看，有一個一一僅只唯一的一個，和我一樣老實得洽洽配合着我們的粗布服裝；我倒抽一口冷氣：「來做甚麽？我和她會有希望嗎？」</p>
<p>考騐是很簡單的：一個頭髮梳得非常光亮臉如敷粉的青年男子，坐在風琴邊，奏着和聲，按名問問音色的組織而已。一個個的答話，我都注意的聽到，錯誤是每個都有，只是錯多錯少的程度不同；而出我意外，那個老實的傢伙，却一點也没有錯。</p>
<p>走出來我的心很輕舒，我十分肯定的覺得：招取六人，我和她一定靠得牢的。但是，一個禮拜過去了，二個禮拜，三個禮拜也過去了，一直以永遠，我再没有接到那個音樂公司的回信。</p>
<p>同時，我預備應一個織綢廠的考，這種失望和不平，就在我二十元保證金的奔走中被遺忘了。</p>
<p>由於友們的相互愛顧，相互扶持，我竟然拿着二十元，又雜在另一種的飢餓者的羣中了。</p>
<p>我們一個個被喊在先生和拿摩溫的面前，他們的眼睛直射得每個被喊者的身上，從頭看到脚，又仔細的着手。</p>
<p>「你讀過書吧？……」他們問我，又似乎是互相商量。</p>
<p>「靠不住，搗亂鬼！……」另一個眼眼放射凶光的大肚皮説。</p>
<p>這樣，我被揮出了門外。</p>
<p>我想：「公司嫌我不漂亮；而這裏却又嫌我的手有點細嫩，「靠不住，搗亂鬼」；——在現社會裏，婦女是以種甚麽意味而被存在的呵！」</p>
<p>現在的我，雖是經濟獨立，性愛與職業絶對自由，個人已經是個解放的社會人；但吃飯是爲生活，而生活不是爲吃飯，作爲社會人的我，如何過着我的社會生活，不至以個人解放爲滿足，而失掉我生活的社會意義，——這正是我實在生活之把握的内容吧。</p>
<p>社會不是婦女的社會，對於一個社會婦女，挾着綑縳婦女的「舊道德」來中傷婦女，幾乎成爲普遍的現象，這在我，是當作一堆垃圾棄置在我旁邊的；似乎這些顯百易明的不曾愚弄到我。最可怕的，新式生活之新的欺騙；温暖平靜，使婦女不知不覺失却與現實的艱苦碰面的勇氣；而在「偉大的愛者」的歌頌裏，多少婦女是犧牲了自已；以及多少婦女輾轉於職業的飢荒之下，忽略自已的周圍，不去認識現實社會機構，以至使自已和社會的發展相違背，而變成職業的俘虜。——我，當然不是例外。踏入社會之後，這種種陷阱，佈滿在我的前途上，看去恍惚是一片葱蘢的青草平原，但只要一徘徊，便陷落在看不見的阱裏了；從一個個陷阱裏爬出來，不斷的需要着自已的挣扎，自已的奮鬭。</p>
<p>在這一個階段的生活，舊社會駡我是叛徒，新社會（？）裏的朋友們，又把我視爲多變的不可靠的女性；所有射在我身上的目光，在我都能感到一種含着譏笑的侮辱的火星。始終我相信：生存者的偉大，是偉大的社會事業，只有在這種事業上，才能有自已的存在，才能發現人和人的關係之光輝。那時——感謝這些給與我的評價和攻擊，促進我對我自已和社會，用嚴密的注意去理角，去分析；眞理援救了我：「被壓迫的婦女，要從社會現象的本質上，社會現象的因果法則上，去認識應走的方向，認識眞理以解放我們全體自身！和一切新舊的惡環境作無情的鬭爭呀！」</p>
<p>這内在的清除，對於我，的確是一個大的變革。叢生在我内心的無原則的糾紛，生活上的沉鬱悲苦氣氛，我是皈依了這眞理的認識而得到清朗的解放了；我以眞正一個人的，意識底的生活，現在和未來，都提供一個光明的照臨在引導我；我内心時常開放着一朶堅勇的歡樂之花。</p>
<p>另一面，失業，飢餓，仍如影子般的跟隨我，這正是一般社會婦女所身受的一個巨大迫害啦！職業是那麽難於獲得，而職業薪資又特别較男子低；尤其，婦女的職業——如辦事員，店員等——多少帶着性的侮辱性質而被點綴的，是何等令人憤懣呵！</p>
<p>然而，這不是感情底的憤懣的事吧。正因爲現在的婦女，還很少是社會的人；她們是家庭的，丈夫或愛人的，兒女的，私有財産和職業的奴隷；所以，踏上社會的婦女，遭受種種迫害與虐待。爲着我們自已，爲着我們婦女的將來，我們要衝破這些藩籬！社會意義的，人類勞動的，抗爭的，戰鬭的，一直到和男子一樣站立在社會上。——這樣，婦女們創造自已，社會人的現實意義！</p>

<p>新年特刊（三）</p>
<h3 id="c334">一年來之中國木刻畫 <a href="#c334" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e334" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">334</a></h3>
<p>— 馮野</p>
<p>在這動盪不安的社會裏，那些裸體美人畫之類的東西已經不能給我們以任何的安慰，我們所要求的是一種新的富有强烈的刺激性的藝術。中國的木刻藝術就在這一條件之下迅速地發展起來了。現在我且把一年來發展的情形分述在下面－因爲手頭上缺乏參考材料，或者有些地方是説得不很充分的。　　一、研究會　在上海方面，我們首先要把ＭＫ木刻研究會提起。該會是在一九三三年元旦産生的，會員有十多個，都是對木刻藝術運動很積極的青年，他們只經過一年的努力就弄出了不少成績。雖我他們的成績－作品在内容上不能令人十分滿意，但在技巧上確已得到了很大的收獲。可惜到了後來該會没有好好的發展下去。過了不久，有未名木刻研究社繼着ＭＫ而起，最初會員只有四個，後來發展到了十多個，這樣直到年底一共就出了五本木刻集。牠的作品的生産量是很驚人的，但在質的方面却還趕不上ＭＫ，不過，無論如何，從事木刻藝術運動的青年的積極性是一天一天的提高了。在廣州方面有現代木刻研究社，該社是去年春間組織的，會員有十多個，成立不及一年已開了兩三次展覽會，出版了一本木刻集，獲得了大衆的很好的批評。在北平，前年也有過研究會的組織，我想他們現在還是在繼續努力着吧。</p>
<p>二、展覽會　展覽會據我所知道的在上海只有一次——ＭＫ木刻研究會第三次展覽會，廣州曾經有過三次。ＭＫ第三次木展作品大概有一百幅左右。在技巧上比過去的任何木展都要進步些，如陳克白，野夫，陳保貞，羅清眞，陳賦之等幾位的技巧已有相當的成熟，可惜在表現的方法及題材的採取上還没有新的開展，特别是時代的核心他們都没有很好的抓到，如帝國主義向我們猛烈地進攻這事實不曾引起我們的作家的注意，因爲在全部作品中幾乎找不出一幅是否有反帝的情緒的，這不能不説是一個很大的遺憾。現代木刻研究社的木展我就没有看到，雖然有人説曾經獲得社會上的很好的批評，但我想總不會比上海的更有進步，從李華的「鋤地工人的休息」，「收穫」和「棄婦」，「埃及古裝」等作品上已經很明顯地看得出來。這幾幅作品我想總能够相當地代表廣州的作品吧，他們也像上海的作者一樣非常注重技巧，所以他們的研究還不到一年，有些技巧已經是很有可觀的了。在題材的採取上很是自由，但這自由已超過了一定的限度；如「埃及古裝」這類題材是毫無意義的。還有一個嚴重問題，就是作者没有確定的宇宙觀，如李華君的「鋤地工人的休息」是表現一個鋤地工人工作疲倦了連坐一會的機會都没有，只能靠着鋤柄休息一下，這不是很明顯地表現着我們的作者是如何吃力地爲大衆呐喊嗎？可是，我們再看他的「收穫」却就不同了。對於全國農村經濟總崩潰，農民在饑寒交迫的環境下挣扎着的可憐的情形，我們的作者是毫無關心的，而反抹殺了事實去描畫農民們那麽豐滿的收穫的畫面。在這裏不是很明顯的表現了作者的内心的矛盾嗎？北平方面在十一月間聽説有幾位作者發起了一個全國木刻展覽會，凖備在今年一月間在北平，天津，南京，上海等地流動展覽，現在我們雖還没有看到他們的貨色，但他們的努力是可以想見的了。</p>
<p>三、出版物　一年來單是木刻集就有五六本之多。未名木刻研究社就出過四五本，如未名木刻集，劉現新波木刻集等。現代木刻社也出過一本。劉現木刻畫的内容是十分空虚的，在技巧上也没有成熟。風景動物等佔了大部份。他這樣忙着出版集子，我們很可以看出作者對木刻的研究是如何的性急了。但他的努力是值得我們佩服的。據作者説，那是手印原本，第一版印了一百五十本，費了不少的精神和時間才成功的。未名木刻集是收集了未名木刻研究社十幾位社員較好的作品編成的，内容方面比劉現木刻畫充實，技巧也好些。其他幾本木刻我想也是差不多的東西，這些都不過是研究技巧過程中的生産品，我們也没有詳述的必要。不過我們熱烈地希望我們的作者以後除了技巧的研究外，須深入社會的最底層去採取我們在製作上所需要的滋料。此外，木刻畫作品散見於雜誌報紙上的也很多。如「文學」上的以羅清禎君的爲最多，他的作品有好些地方是强烈表現着歪曲的意識的，如「韓江舟子」，「三農婦」等就很明顯地看得出來。像畫面上的農婦，船夫，作者不曾把他拿來作中心題材，而只把他作爲風景的點綴品，使一幅農村風景畫更其生色起來，這種作品不是茶餘酒後的消遣品嗎？在技巧上不管怎樣純熟，對於我們始終是無關的。張望的風景畫技巧上比羅清禎君的更好，在那裏也很可以看出我們的作者對於風景畫的製作是如何的賣力，可惜在飢寒交迫的生活上拚命的挣扎的人們，拿不出閒情去玩賞——未免辜負了作者的熱情。此外如「文藝漫畫」，「太白」等刊物也都在很熱烈的介紹木刻藝術，那些作品的成績大部分也是只限於技巧這一方面，在内容上我們的作者同樣應該用一番克苦的工夫的。「中華日報」的「戲刊」上的「阿Ｑ連續畫」，或者已引起了不少人的注意。該畫全部只有十一幅，我想像「阿Ｑ正傳」這樣複雜的故事，單用一幅畫去表現無論如何是不够的。我們若把這十一幅東西挪給没有看過阿Ｑ正傳的人看，那他必定要感到莫名其妙。所以牠只可作爲文章的揷圖，作爲獨立的連續畫而存在着是不成功的。</p>
<p>四、總結　事實已説明了中國木刻藝術在一年來的發展是如何地迅速了，可是這一發展是非常散漫的，没有系統的，以後我們應該加緊努力，使牠能踏上一定的軌道去發展，只有這樣，中國木刻運動的前途才會有希望呢！</p>
<h3 id="c335">一年來之中國敎育 <a href="#c335" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e335" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">335</a></h3>
<p>— 葛石熊</p>
<p>敎育事業是一種經常的活動，没有止境，亦没有滿點。過往一年中之中國敎育，足以大書特書者約有下列數點：關於普通敎育者：一爲生産敎育與勞作敎育之倡導，二爲敎育制度改造之呼聲勃起，三爲民族復興運動與敎育之聯繫，四爲社會人士對於普及敎育的努力；關於高等敎育者：一爲「畢業卽失業」問題之日趨嚴重化，二爲禁舞問題反映到大學敎育之脆弱。兹分述於後：</p>
<p>（一）生産敎育與勞作敎育之倡導</p>
<p>我國自清季倡辦學校以來，因敎育方針的錯誤，依然是一貫的士大夫敎育。學生進了學校中讀書，卽成爲一種没</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>有生活技能的特殊階級，多二讀書人，卽少一生産者，數十年來敎育的效果，不但不能帮助國家走上生聚敎訓之路，且反使生産的分子日漸减少。近大鑒於這種書蠧敎育之失敗，爰有「手腦並用」的「生産敎育」與「勞作敎育」之提倡。其内容，據七月二十八日各報所載，爲：各地學校應由行政機關與敎育機關按照本地方需要及學生之個性與家庭狀况，分别規定敎育方針，總以注意敎育生産爲原則，並指示實施方法如下：（一）每校須設一學校園，督飭學生自行耕種，各種農作物實地練習，並得依照利用合作社之組織，附設農塲或林牧塲，由敎職員率領學生種植畜牧，厲行半工半讀主義，所有收獲除開支及繳充購置或租賃地價外，敎員學生均得分配利益，以資鼓勵。（二）每校須設一標本室，領導學生採取本地方之天然産品或人工製造品，陳列觀摩。（三）就公民課添授各種合作社知識，就地理課添設本地方物産及應行改進之方法，就自然課添授農林蠶桑，養鷄，養猪，養蜂各種知識，改進技能，就理化及手工兩課添授改進本地方工業方法，及製造成品出售，以資提倡。（四）提倡勤儉，養成耐勞習苦不用校役之風氣。（五）各地按照地方需要，至少須辦職業學校一所，務使學校塲廠化，學生工徒化，職業社會化。這可説生産敎育除理論上的鼓吹外，已有具體的辦法了。十二月中敎育部舉行全國勞作成績展覽會，其所陳列的各地出品確已超越「手工」「工藝」的範圍。又全國職業敎育會議亦多輔助生産敎育推行之决議案，唯視執行如何耳。</p>
<p>（二）敎育制度改造之呼聲勃起</p>
<p>中國敎育制度一向没有自已的主張，忽而仿傚日本，忽而仿傚美國，忽而仿傚英法，盲人瞎馬，無所適從，民國十七年後，始漸入軌道，中小學進展極速，但仍未見能適應國家之需要。故北京大學校長蔣夢麟及胡適吳俊升翁文灝陶孟和徐炳昶周炳琳等提議用試騐方法，來修正敎育制度。他們所發現的現行敎育制度之弊端如下：</p>
<p>（一）現行中小學制度，過分側重升學方面，而事實上則不能升學之學生反居多數。（三）現行敎育制度不能兼顧城市鄉村，使相倚發展，年來農村破産，國本動摇，故必先謀農村之建設，敎育上必先養成有知識之農夫。（三）吾國敎育制度與課程，往往抄襲外國，不合國情及本國之特殊需要。（四）中等敎育之基礎知識訓練，未能適應大學之需要。</p>
<p>蔣氏等之改造方案提出之後，全國敎育界人士極爲注目，認爲是敎育制度改造的發靱與覺醒，但此種方略是否卽爲醫治吾國敎育病態之唯一聖藥，則尙不敢斷言。</p>
<p>（三）民族復興運動與敎育之聯繫</p>
<p>連年國士的喪亡，農村的破産，使我民族之生機，奄奄一息，民族復興運動於焉高唱入雲。昔越王勾踐，十年生聚，十年敎訓，卒以　吳，故除一方面努力武力的國防建設外，對於精神的國防建設亦已同樣重視。精神的國防建設惟何，民族復興敎育也。鄭通和先生在「江蘇敎育」上發表「民族本位敎育論」一文，卽此最尖鋭之主張。小學校中，一年來於各科中注入鄉土敎材，救國敎材及重視公民訓練，於潛移默化之中，民族復興運動已與敎育密切地聯繫着了，這不能不説是這一年中敎育的特點。</p>
<p>（四）社會人士對於普及敎育的努力</p>
<p>吾國文盲數字，爲世界各國之最高者。一國民智的高下，與國勢的强弱有最大的關係，故中國民族的危殆，要非無因。普及敎育，提高民智的呼聲，久已高唱入雲，然國庫如洗，敎育經費苦無寛籌餘地，在可能限度之外，已無法再謀擴展。去年九月中，馬相伯陶知行等發起中國普及敎育助成會之組織。該會有二點足以注意者：（一）該會的宗旨，在採取最經濟最迅速最能持久最能令人進步之方法，力謀普及大衆與兒童向上生活所需要之敎育以助成中華民國與大同世界之創造。（二）該會的敎育目的，是發民國民基礎敎育，扶助人人識字明理，實行近除文盲，增進生産自强能力，改良民衆生活，啟發民族意識，以達自給自衛愛羣愛國的目的。</p>
<p>最的工作，已有敎育車之設備，及流動學校之計劃。敎育車在大塲實騐區，和閘北趙家花園花邨實騐區附近鄉村試行，成績甚佳。每車由「小先生」兩人擔任敎員。流動學校爲工讀性質，現尙未見諸事宜。</p>
<p>（五）「畢業卽失業」問題之日趨嚴重化本年七月，北平各大學畢業生職業運動大同盟突然出現於報章上，大學生爲社會中之優秀分子，在中國建設事業方在發靱需才孔亟之時，竟以「畢業卽失業」聞，實爲一錯綜而又嚴重之問題。該同盟譚庶潛在招待新聞記者席上説：「……仝人有此組織，蓋所以促進政治敎育之改進與職業問題之解决耳。」該同盟宣言中又謂：「三十年來，政府及社會人士但知廣設學校，造成人才，而如何安揷統計，則無人過問，甚有以敎育爲營業，視學生爲商品，濫加製造，不計銷路，以致人浮於事，學失所用，用非所學，……老死窗牖者，何可勝數。而工於鑽營，憑藉勢利者，反得飛黄騰達，獵取權位。……延至今日，已成滿目失業之社會。……一言之以蔽之，卽職業問題爲之也，不良敎育之影響爲之也。」可謂慨乎言之。此運動開始後，始而京漢響應，繼而推派代表晋京請願，事態日趨嚴重。與論界對此事評論不一。平心論之，此運動之發生，不應由敎育界人獨尸其咎，政治與社會經濟制度之不良，均其産生之背景。然辦理或主持大學敎育者，允宜憬然覺醒當前敎育之危機而有以更張也。</p>
<p>（六）禁問題反映到大學敎育之脆弱上海敎充界的禁止大學生跳舞接續状職業運動大同盟而起。「跳舞」本身本未可視爲罪惡，而大學生習於聲色之樂，迷戀忘返，對於學業的攻求，生活的紀律，置於腦後，確足使大學敎育根本破産。然禁舞是否卽能驅學生入研究室中，禁舞之後是否可使學生不趨入其他聲色的迷信中，這都不能不使吾人深爲懷疑的。</p>
<p>上海各大學之禁舞，正是反映着目前大學生活的不充實，訓育的缺乏積極性，學術研究空氣之淡薄。所以禁舞不是根本的辦法，而且禁舞也未必會有好的成果。如果大學的主持者不從改善設備，充實學程，使大學生有閒的精神得到正當的宣洩上着手，禁舞的治標之計，吾未見其可也。</p>
<p>綜上所述，一年來的中國敎育，從任何一方面看來，都可説是在覺悟悔過改造的路程中沈着前進，容或缺點到處可以發現，然敎育界中人一致求善的態度，始終是可以欽佩的。舊的年頭過去了，作者最後祝望敎育事業的工作者，在新的年頭中創造出敎育史的新頁來！</p>
<h3 id="c336">一年來之中國書業 <a href="#c336" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e336" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">336</a></h3>
<p>— 康乃德</p>
<p>不景氣的火球，繼續在市塲上滾動，各種工商業的繁榮都日益被其燒燬了。書業雖同時又是一種文化事業，但也不能逃脱一般工商業所遭的惡運，所謂不景氣的現象，在一九三四年的中國書業中是更鮮明地表現了出來。</p>
<p>大家知道，書物的購買者是一般知識份子，特别是一般青年學生。但近年以來，因爲工商業的凋敝·農村經濟的破産，在失業恐慌的災難中，有許多知識份子和青年學生都陷入了失業失學的窮途；他們連喫大餅油條住亭子門都成問題，那裏過有錢去買書呢？於是，書物的購買力减少，各書店的營業，當然也就日益衰落了。</p>
<p>據一般書業家説，向來中國主要的　書市塲是：上海，北平，東北，南京，廣東，福建，四川……等地。而今呢？東北已被日本强佔了去，中國書籍根本不能運去售賣，這是不必説了；至於其他地方，書物市塲也是今不如昔，非常蕭條冷淡。現在，我們且先看北平吧——</p>
<p>北平的「書市」，主要的是在東安市塲和西單商塲。一般書賈都是在這兩個地方開着小舖或擺着大大小小的攤子，經營他們的生意。過去，他們除販賣上海各書店出的書籍外，還暗中將那些容易銷售的書翻印出來，賤價出售，以取得較大的利潤；後來因爲引起了出版家與著作者的嚴重干涉，所谓「北平的翻版書」才漸漸减少了；現在，他們的生意，主要的是經售上海各家書　出版的書籍，與未賤價收買窮學生的書籍來售賣。但因爲書物的購買力的减少，北平的「書市」已遠不及從前那樣的熱鬧，有許多書攤也不復存在了。</p>
<p>其次是南京——據「徐報」所載：「南京書店業在民國十七年以前，可謂無聲無臭。乃自國府奠都南京以後，書店業爲應時勢之需求，亦隨之發展。迨民國二十年冬，始成立南京書店同業公會，負責指導同業之發展。迄至最近已有八十五家加入公會合作。……南京書店業年來營業已到極度，不景氣之秋，幾家家書店虧本。其原因有：（一）各書店積存圖書過多，各中小書店爲謀經濟之活動，多不顧血本脱售，如定價一元，旣打一折，再打九扣之類。不聽公會之約束，敎使書價不能劃一。（二）上海方面，雖設有圖書出版審查委員會，審查出版之圖書。但本市各書店因消息不靈通，致不知何者爲被禁之圖書，隨便由上海購來，到京時被禁止出售，致受意外之損失。」何以各書店會「積存圖書過多」呢？他們又何以要「不顧血本脱售」呢？回答很簡單：因爲市面蕭條，少人買書，没有辦法，不得不如此！</p>
<p>其他如廣東四川等地的情形也是一樣　過去廣　　　成都等地的書店有許多在上海都有莊客，經常向上海各書店批購書籍，可是現在不僅是有些莊客不見；而且有許多書店都關了門，根本就失掉了存在。因此，上海各書店不知道有好多書賬在這些地方收不回來。</p>
<p>上海不消説是中國書業的中心，别的地方的書店多半都是經售上海各書局出版的書籍的。因爲整個市塲的冷落，各地書店的營業不佳，作爲書業中心的上海各家書局的生意當然也就大成問題了。在這種情形之下，上海各家書店爲了要圖生存，當然就不得不相互競爭。這競爭的現象，從各家書局的出版傾向和其一般的經營方法上表現了出來。</p>
<p>一九三四年中國的出版界中，我們可以看到兩大傾向：一是有些小書店，因爲不能大批出書，只能靠出雜誌來維持門面；二是那些比較大的書局，因爲看到一般書籍的購買力减少，無法推銷，便拚命重印什麽全書全史的古書，以各圖書館，各文化機關與各史學專家爲其主人的顧客。前一　向的結果，便構成了「雜誌年」的名稱；後一傾向的表現，便透露出了復古潮流的一個特徵。</p>
<p>同時，隨着復古潮流的發展，還有人因爲經濟力量薄弱，不能跟着「商務」「中華」等去影印大批的中國古書，但又要想投復古之機，没有辦法，便拚命去搬運西洋古董。例如辛墾書店，便是專出十七八世紀的乃至希臘時代的西歐哲學和科學的古董，來與什麽「四庫全書」，　　今圖書某　」　「二十五史一……等國粹相映成趣的。然而不幸，一般新的書籍，無論如何總還有其購買者，中國的古書也有圖書館，文化機關和那些史學專家來照顧，惟獨這西洋古董，已經爲許多大思想家批判過整理過的西洋古董，簡直無人問津。所以，這些投機家投機的結果，不僅不能使其業務繁榮，反而在營業上弄出了更大的危機來。好便是没有買主，以致存貨日多，現金週轉不靈，結果是無法對付一般債主。</p>
<p>五於在一般經營方法上，上海各書店的競爭情形也内樣顯明地表現了出來。拿「大减價」來説吧，我們所看到的是：今天甲書店登出廣告照原價打八折售價，明天乙書店就來了個對折賣書，接着在書物市塲上便是「三折」「四折」……等等的呼聲；如果你肯到四馬路各書店去看一看，那你一定可以見到什麽「新書當賤貨賣」，一一元只賣八分」，「新書好多錢一鎊」（書變成了大米麵粉，須用磅來量！）與夫什麽書「打一折再打八扣出賣」等字樣。同時，還有一些書店，如「生</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>活」，「開明」等，更大登廣告，謂外埠向其購書，可免匯費，又如「上海雜誌公司」，其開幕後的「第一聲呼號」便是：「負無限責任爲君代定雜誌」，「倘有中途停刊，可憑本公司定單，取回定不。」……這樣的競爭情形，恐怕是近年來所特有的吧。</p>
<p>在各書店的相互競爭中，資本雄厚的當然可以參加競爭，維持門面，但那些經濟力量薄弱的小書店可就無法生存了。據説最的就有一兩個小書店，因爲欠印刷局和紙店的錢太多，無法支持，恐怕就要關門大吉了。</p>
<p>書業不景氣的結果，印刷業和紙業自然要受影響，同時，就是一般文人的生活也遭到了極大的打擊。非常顯然，因爲書籍的銷路不好，文人的稿子就不易賣出；卽使賣了出去也因爲賣價過低與夫「打折扣」「除空白」「除標點」甚至「除外國文」（這是最近某大書賈新發明的！）的關係，文人費去許多時間，絞腦汁的結果，所得也就無幾了；而且，還有一種專門騙稿子的書賈，把文人的譯著拿去印成了書，硬不給其稿費或版税。我有一位朋友，他譯了一本書，在某小書店出版，現在這書已經再版了，但他還未得到一文版税：當他最近去向那書店要版税時，書賈們竟向他開起玩笑來：哈哈！你這書原是送與我們出版的，没有版税啊！謝謝你！於是，這位朋友没有辦法，咬着牙關，痛在心頭，只得怪自已的「命边多乘」了！—像這樣滑稽的事情也有的！由此當可想見在書業不景氣中一般文人所受的災難了。</p>
<h3 id="c337">一年來之中國出版界 <a href="#c337" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e337" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">337</a></h3>
<p>— 范璞女士</p>
<p>文化的發展和變化是具有時間性和空間性的。在一定的時代，依據一定的空間環境，就體現出一定的文化思想的動向與内容，這幾乎是不用提説的事實。自然，要想理解一定時代的思想文化的内容和動向，是要從著作者和讀書雙方面去觀察，才能透視出它的全形態的，然而這裏也有一個簡便方法，可以作爲我們測騐的指示器，那就是看出版界的情形如何。固然，社會的多數人的心理想些甚麽，著作者想要説些甚麽，以及讀者愛讀些甚麽書報，要求些甚麽和識，是和出版界之間存在得有矛盾的。因爲有許多著作者寫作的東西，往往出版機關不城要牠，以至於不能出版，而許多讀者所需要的知識，愛讀的書報，出版界却又不能供給他們。因此，要想很凖確地探到社會思想的深處，明瞭其趨向，這尙不能單純地從出版界的現狀看得出來。雖然如此，但在一定時代的社會思想的表現，成爲文化動向的特徵，且能作爲現時及將來之理解的材料的，亦可以從出版界的表現看取出來，作爲評價的凖則。因爲出版事業可以大體上體現出社會的環境。它能出些甚麽東西，這是社會的環境所决定的。它能獲得一些甚麽作品來出版，也可以表明這一時代的社會文化進展到甚麽階段，已經獲得了怎樣的探求成績。至於它的出版物銷售的狀况，則更足以説明讀者的要求與傾向。一句話，這一切的一切，都體現着整個社會的思想，文化乃至政治經濟的内容與動向。所以我們在這裏回顧一下中國出版界一年來的狀况，無異於是在把中國一年來的整個文化發展階段作一回顧，特别是希望讀者所它作爲一年來的中國思想史的象徵看。</p>
<p>一九三四年的中國出版界，在書籍方面雖然不見得比一九二八及一九二九那幾年多，但其數量比之一九一五以一九二七年總是超過的。在雜誌方面，我們相保它在量的方面是趕不上一九二五到一九二七年的，但去年一年確實也可以説是一個雜誌年。據舒新城先生在文化建設月刊上所指示我們的統計數字説，一九二八至一九三一年在内政部登記的書籍是一·０００種，三二年八八六種，三三年一·八九０種，總計爲三·七七六種。雜誌新聞紙方面，一九二八年九月至一九三二年十二月爲一·四０三種，三三年爲一·九一九種，總計爲三·三三一種。而一九三四年一月至九月新聞紙和雜誌在内政部登記的只有六五四種，根據申報廣告上的統計至十月截止，總計新刊出版物亦不過一·二八六種，且他未分别出書籍與新聞紙及雜誌來，因此一九三四年似乎比三三年相差甚遠。但這些數字是不很正確。因爲在一九二八至三二年，就書籍方面説多半是没有登記的，實數當遠在已登記的數目之上。而一九三四年連同書籍雜誌，卽根據申報廣告亦嫌不够。因爲在申報登廣告的大都限於京滬兩地的出版物，他如天津，北平，廣州等處，大半是在就地的報紙登廣告，所以那個數字遠不足以概括全國。因此在參照事實的大概估量上説，一九二五至一九二七年是書籍少而雜誌特别多，一九二八年以後的三四年中書籍比較出得多而雜誌少，一九三四年一年内書籍方面比前期要少些，但也不是特别落後的，只是方向有些轉變而已，至於雜誌方面，那是要比一九二八年以後發達得多了。</p>
<p>這種出版界的變化特徵，其原因在那裏呢？大概説來，是由於一九二五至一九二七年是一個行動時期，在那一時代，大多數人都把全部時間和精力消耗在行動方面去了，不暇作深刻的研究。其所需要的只是些簡單而現實的宣傳與實踐上的指導，因此整部的書籍很少有人去讀。那時不但行動者需要宣傳和簡要的現實的行動指導，而且那時的社會團體特别發達，每一個學校都有幾個以上的社團，而每一個社團亦多半有自已的出版物。在社會上一般的社團和出版物也是很多的。這都是那一時代的書籍出版跟不上雜誌發達的原因。但到一九二八年以後，廣泛的行動時期過去了，社團活動也减少了，靜的研究就有逐漸代替動的活動的趨勢。理論和認識上的深入，過去了的歷史事變之反省，這都不是簡單的雜誌所能滿足的。所以後來雜誌的數量逐漸减少，而書籍，特别是基本知識的理論書籍的介紹，遂在那幾年中發達起來。許多家新文化的小書店，在那幾年中如雨後春筍一般的勃興，卽足以表現那時出版界的特徵。時代推移到了一九三四年，由於客觀環境的决定，社會科學的理論介紹和研究遭遇到困難，於是一九二八年以來的出版方向便不能再照樣繼續下去，而這也就影響到書籍的出版方面。然而時代的靜態不但没有改變，而且是愈益加深了，因此研究總還是一個客觀上要求的條件。所以一九三四年在書籍出版的量上，並没有特殊的低落，只是方向和從前顯示着明白的轉變而已。至於雜誌方面，在客觀的原因上是有許多理由决定它活躍起來的。第一，由於這一年中有兩種思想在劇烈地競爭着，所以在攻勢方面的一種，爲了爭取完全的領導和代替，努力發刊它的雜誌，以爲宣傳武器。然而在被攻的那方面呢？它亦尙不甘示弱，常常隨時改變方式和内容，來企圖保持它的地位，也不斷地出版雜誌。第二，目前的中國是在國難期中，大家處在彷徨不安的狀况之下，實在有無窮的實際問題擺在面前，使人人感覺得不能置之度外，必須去研究理解它。可是雜誌是比較易於立言的，因爲那種短篇論文尙可以含混地半面地透露出些意見。所以一九三四年雜誌的衆多，正表明中國社會因爲難關迫切，已形成一種不得不説幾句話的社會苦悶和牢騷現象。第三，世界和中國的不景氣，已使一般知識分子失業窮困，而新書業的頽敗，更使他們連吃文字飯的最後出路都日益狹小了。因此大家都羣趨於以辦雜誌爲自已找出路，解决暫時的生活，乃至收羅失業的文人以爲活動的張本的方法。所以這一年來的雜誌特别發達，亦足以説明智識分子的生活恐慌的裏面。總之，一九三四年的出版界，是因爲上述的種種原因，而形成了它的雜誌年的第一特徵。</p>
<p>前面已經提出了一九三四年出版界已經轉變了方向的問題，但這不僅是一個可以提説的問題，而且是這一年出版界的特徵。因爲在過去的出版界，在書籍方面是趨向於社會科學之一般的原理原則的討論與介紹。但這種討論和介紹，在現時是和環境相矛盾的，不能不停止。於是出版界在出書方面，現時就發生了兩個普遍的新傾向。一方面是舊古董的重新問世：最顯著的是商務印書館的翻印四庫珍本，單是初集就有二三一種，共約兩千船；是中華書局的縮印古今圖書集成，約八００册；是宋磧砂藏經五九二册，以及四部叢刊，四部備要，宛委别藏，遼海叢書，都在印行中。此外，重印舊書的小書局和社會團體也是很多的。所以，如果説一九三四年是雜誌年是對的，那麽，我們又可稱它爲舊書重出的古董問世年。在另一方面，對於書籍的出版，雖然實踐的理論研究和介紹比較的少，但在重出國内陳貨之外，也有着從國外介紹哲學和科學的新氣象發現。商務印書館最近曾選了不少的世界哲學科學名著在翻譯。中山文化敎育館於第一期出書中已出版了多種這類的書，而第二期出書亦正在選譯哲學科學名著。辛墾書店是已經出了多種哲學科學叢書，現在尙在繼續譯出。因此一九三四年的出版界，可以説是理論的與實際的科學介紹年，特别是自然科學中的理論自然科學，在這一年中介紹了好多種世界有名的大著。這兩種傾向，在前一種是向着舊路回跑，對於中國的思想和文化的前進之逆的作用，將會發生一種暫時的影響，是不可否認的。在後一種，我們亦不可輕視它，以爲它走出了實踐圈外，没有好多益處。須知在中國，對於自然之深刻的認識和理解素來是落後的。人類最終的問題是對付自然的問題，對於自然的正確認識，將成爲正確的哲學思維的起點，並能以此促進正確的人生觀之誕生，形成正確的社會觀而達於正確的實踐理論。如此，則這些哲學科學的介紹，正指示出中國思想界在作進一步的深刻地理解整個世界之努力，在不久的未來，將由自然科學的進步的領導，來一個中國思想上的文藝復興，以達到社會的復興，是必然的。因此，一九三四年的出版界的方向轉變，是以舊書翻印與科學介紹兩種背道而馳的矛盾現象表現它的第二特徵的。</p>
<p>其次，就一九三四年的出版界情形看來，一方面可以證明中國現時的經濟狀况是不景氣和一般民衆的窮困加甚，他方面是文化運動更减少了它的普遍性，而且表現出大多數青年都不好讀書，不求深造，只有少數人在努力於前述的哲學和自然科學的研究。這些現象我們可以從許多事實中得到證明。第一，一九三四年全年，在書籍出版方面雖仍有相當的數量，但舊書的購買大部分是以文化機關如學校圖書館爲雇主。在新的哲學科學方面，銷售的情形也很壞，購買的人非常的少。各書局都時常大廉價，就是從來不折不扣的商務中華等大書局，也加入了大廉價的競爭塲合，而有些書店則旣是終年大廉價，甚至有折扣打到一二折的書。然而儘管如此廉價競爭，結果還是生意不好，許多書店不能維持。這正説明了人民窮困無力買書讀，或者有許多富家青年學子不肯讀書的現象。第二，無聊的小説和帶有肉感的畫報倒比正經書銷得。那一種報紙如對於體育和電影等消息載得充分時，那就爭先恐後的去買。這是表明了大多數青年思想上的無聊頽廢，不以學問爲事，而一心沉醉於無聊的消遣。其實，雜誌的特殊流行，與小品文的刊物能够暢銷</p>
<p>以下接第五版</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>，其中　　　　　　　力　　　和大多數人不肯求深造的傾向。雖然民並不是説看雜誌是不對的，也不是説小品文刊物完全無意義，然而那正是讀者從經濟上和理解問題上打簡省算盤的象徵，所以隨便買一兩份雜誌或小品文看看了事的心理，就充人地表露出來了。所有上述的那些現象，就是出版界所體現出來的一九三四年文化上的第三特徵。</p>
<p>再就一九三四年的出版物内容來説，在書籍方面我們已經在前面説過了，是以趨向於眩耀古物和紹介哲學科學雙方面並進發展爲其特徵的，可是，在雜誌方面，也有可以標識的一種顯明傾向。大多數的雜誌，對於政治問題都只側重於國際政治的研究，對於經濟問題則多半集中在國際的經濟恐慌的分折和中　農村經濟崩潰，城市經濟衰頽的討論，對於中國民族的獨立，自由的問題，大有不肯探究之勢。這正如小品文，幽默作法之在一九三四年盛行一樣，也是出版界的特徵之一。</p>
<p>總括一九三四年的出版界概况來説，它是體現着中國思想界和文化運動的瑕瑜互見的現象。一方面是思想分化之極端的發展，他方面則表現着一般的不景氣，因而大多數人逐漸被剷除於知識圈外，不能受出版文化的恩賜。而一般青年之倦於求知以及新書業之頽廢不振等等，也是個嚴重問題。我們希望能在一九三五年使科學的洗禮普及於一般的社會，並以此挽救新書業之墜落，那就是中國文化前途的幸運，也是中國民族的幸運了。</p>
<h3 id="c338">一年來之中國世界語運動 <a href="#c338" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e338" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">338</a></h3>
<p>— 冰</p>
<p>中國的世界語運動，是全世界的世界語運動的一翼，正好像中國是全世界的一環一樣。因此，我們在檢閲一年來中國世界語運動的時候，有同時來回顧一下國際世界語運動的必要。</p>
<p>過去了的一年在政治上是個動亂的年頭，同樣在國際世界語運動上也是個多事之秋。這一年來，在國際世界語運動的舞臺上，有着各種各樣的脚色登塲。有的還用着所謂「中立主義」（對宗敎政治保守中立態度的主張）的招牌來吸引觀衆，但是因爲這些演員自已就早已没有當年的理想主義的熱情了，所以結果台下只是一陣倒采。有些披上陳死人的屍衣，當着褐色宣傳員的勾當。有的玩弄一些漂亮的台詞，好呌老實一點的人上當。以「海賊」爲商標的幽默派，以集納主義標榜的新聞記者「Nia　Gazeto一派），也各各在一九三四年登塲了。正是，明星大會串，好不熱鬧！</p>
<p>但是，一年來國際世界語運動上究竟有些什麽事件，值得特别一提的呢？好的，我們還是不要凑熱鬧，來冷靜地考察一番吧——</p>
<p>第一是希脱拉先生治理下的世界語運動。自從希脱拉執政以來，世界語就被視作「猶太人的創造物」而加以排斥。於是那些中立主義的先生們嚇得屁尿直流，連中立主義也不敢提出。原來中立主義就是「第三種人」，而在目下的德國是不許你掉在當中的。於是整批的中立主義者都穿褐色的制服來了。這一下子可把「中立主義的西洋鏡戳穿了。但是他們却説，世界語和「内在理想」（柴門霍夫所倡導的人類愛的理想）本來是兩件事，不相干的。這樣，「内在理想」就變成「外在理想」去了。然而在德國，却有着另一個奇蹟。業已被禁很久的GLEＡ（德國工人世界語學會）却並未消失，還在艱苦中從事研究。去年八月ＩＰＥ（勞働者世界語者國際）在法國舉行代表大會時，ＧＬＥＡ還正式選派代表十餘人，隨帶ＧＬＥＡ捐助ＩＰ的五百馬克，大模大樣地出席大會。</p>
<p>第二是出走後的ＩＰＥ。ＩＰＥ自在德國會所被封以來，卽遷往荷蘭，並着手重整旗鼓。直到去年的代表大會，差不多已恢復到原來的狀態了。各國支部在國際通信研究工作中，和其他國際團體所屬的勞動者世界語者共同合作，獲得了不少成功。匈牙利等國若干勞動者世界語團體，已宣告脱離ＳＡＴ（全世界無民族學會，也是個工人世界語者國際組織）而加入ＩＰＥ。另一方面，ＳＡＴ幹部還在堅持着「殖民地民衆並不高興起來解放自已」，「本民族不能開發富源，由他民族來開發，並無不合理之處」等等的怪論，不是間接在支持帝國主義了嗎？ＳＡＴ會員中有許多熱望着和ＩＰＥ合作，這是在去年ＳＡＴ大會上曾通過了重新統一勞動者世界語運動這一决議上，可以看出來的。</p>
<p>第三是蘇聯世界語運動的新動向。近年來隨着工業建設的步伐，蘇聯在厲行着勞動者國際主義的敎育，而世界語便被廣汛地應用了。尤其在那些兒童中，在所謂少年先鋒隊中，進行着活潑的世界語運動。這裏，我且舉出一個具體事實來吧。却説在外高加索亞瑞爾巴强共和國的一個小學中，有一隊少年用了世界語和全世界以及蘇聯各民族通信。孩子們把每一個國家指定一人爲「大使」，負起專責來搜集各該國的材料，進行着非常廣汛而有趣的通信。結果，在去年全蘇聯兒童國際通信的競賽中，他們果然獲得了最好的成績——第一。於是孩子們被送到全蘇聯各地遊歷，還送到莫斯科領奬。在舉行給奬典禮之際，蘇聯世界語者聯盟還派人當衆雄辯了一通。在歸途中，有三十多個各團體代表伴着這些孩子們回家去，但是在半路上，這些成年人都宣誓説：從今以後一定學習世界語。這個事實告訴我們，世界語在將來會有着怎樣的一個前途。</p>
<p>此外，在國際世界語運動上，值得一提的事件很多很多，我們在這裏只能提到下面幾件事：（一）出版活動——以蘇聯内戰時代英雄Ｃhapajev爲主人公的小説一部（自俄文譯出）但丁神曲「地獄篇」（據説譯者爲了譯述此巨著而學習原文的），「世界語百科全書」，「提起槍來」（描寫蘇聯軍隊生活的長篇小説），「往何處去」，（譯者是柴門霍夫的女兒），「塔之街」（描寫奥國失業恐慌的長篇原作小説）……「化學工業」月刊，蘇聯化學勞動者世界語者編印），「蘇維埃學校」（蘇聨敎育者世界語者編印），「我們的報紙」（報紙型的月刊），「海賊」幽默派月刊）……。（二）新團體——「薩爾·阿爾薩斯·羅侖工人世界語學會」（出刊物兩種）；「國際進步的世界語者敎育者聯合會」，發行機關誌「敎育者的火把」及「全世界世界語敎育通信」。（三）ＩＡＲＥＶ的動向－「國際遂進的世界語者作家學會」（ＩＡＲＥＶ）出版機關誌「大衆文學」，並擬出版文學通信稿，恊助各國作家，搜集全世界各地資料，並代爲譯述（全譯或摘譯）　各種傑作——定貨翻譯。</p>
<p>現在我們再回過頭來，看一看國内的情形吧：這一年來，中國的世界語運動究有多少的進展呢。</p>
<p>第一是宣傳上的進步。現在的青年世界語者，已不像我們的前輩，把世界語禮拜做世界和平的萬應仙丹，開口世界語容易，文法只有十六條，閉口世界大同，人類一家。單用容易來宣傳是不够的，而烏托邦的説敎更是蒙蔽現實異常有害的東西。我們只有在具體而切實和工作上，在參與有助於社會和文化的活動上，才能顯示出世界語的眞實意義，才能獲得更多的支持者。從這一個理解上　　　一　　的宣傳工作，　　　做到了一部份的。我們單就文字宣傳一項而論，我們已不容易找到那些痴人説夢般的美麗而有毒的辭句了。而在國内各種重要的報章刊物上，常有關於世界語和譯自世界語的作品文字。例如在「申報」，「申報月刊」，「中華日報」，「中華月報」，「文學」，「文學季刊」，「讀者」，「現代」，「青年界」，「太白」，「世界知識」，……都曾有過這類的文字。這一方面説明了世界語者本身的努力，而另一方面也未嘗不是編者以及一般讀者對於世界語的理解加深之故。我們相信，這一種宣傳方式（自然，這個工作的意義並不止於宣傳而已）是正當的。</p>
<p>第二是運動的開展。隨着宣傳的擴大，一年來的運動確有若干新的進展。在世界語圈内，目前正有不少新的世界語者——新人在開始出現。從另一個方面看來，這也就是一般語言技術的提高。在一年前，甚至在半年前剛剛開始讀字母的，不少已能用世界語來辯論會話，已能用世界語來讀書通信作文翻譯了。從整個運動的動向上來看，亦已開始跨上了一個蔪新的階段，卽世界語的大衆化，世界語不祗走進了學校，而且走進了商店，工塲，農村中去了。在内地的世界語運動，新成立團體的有貴州，河北景縣等處，他如北平，青島，天津，廣州，太原，南京，長沙，成都也都有着或大或小的進展。這裏我們因爲篇幅的關係，不去一一細説了。有着頗久的歷史的「上海世界語學會」，一二八時被毁於閘北，自前年復興以來，我們正希望它能爲我語前途努力，不幸在一九三四年忽然停頓，月刊「綠光」也不出了。這不能不説是一件可惜的事。</p>
<p>第三是工作範圍的擴大。爲了實用世界語起見，必然的結果是：世界語者分頭在各個領域内工作，這便是我在這裏要説的工作範圍的擴大。一年來的運動，已注意到這一點。現在的世界語者們，已感到單是一個世界語運動是不够的，重要的是應用世界語的運動。因此，一年來的通信運動，已比前年來得活潑了一點。他如語言理論的研究，文藝作品的翻譯，國外通信的譯述，等等都是。</p>
<p>第四是大衆語論戰。世界語者的參加大衆語的論戰，以及在世界語者中央衆語討論的熱烈，和對於這個問題的關心，是值得特别提出的。尤其是中國話書法拉丁化，得到了中國世界語者方面的支持。在這一次論戰中，顯示出了中國現代的世界語者，已不再是那些不吃烟火食，蔑視民族語的空想家，而是語言園地上的最切實的工作者，他們要把國際語運動和民族語的改革運動有機地連結起來。這是一九三四年世界語界的一件大事。</p>
<p>在出版方面，各地都爲着經濟的困難而依然不振，去年一年中比較重要的出版物有：世界語活葉文選（上海世界語書店），Plena　Votaro（綜合書社翻印），Ｐetro（初級敎本，綜合書社翻印），漢文世界語字典（北平），茵夢湖（北平），莎樂美（成都），……在刊物方面，上海出的「世界」是目下内容最豐富的刊物，其他尙有太原的「播種者」，北平的「世界語之光」，廣州的「廣州世界語月刊」，及Verdemulo，成都的「綠幟」等等。</p>
<p>中國的世界語運動是有着非常有望的遂途的，弱小的民族的世界語之動的進展，對於整個世界的運動，正如秋田雨雀説過的，是有着極重大的意義。不過，横在中國世界語運動前面的，還有着無數的艱難，是需要我們來一一克服的。世界語者們，努力罷！</p>

<p>— 黄影呆</p>
<p>代表歷史上的一頁紀載</p>
<p>值價由事件變化而估定</p>
<p>説時遲，來時快，子彈横飛着。喬治在南王的車後，立刻看見兩個攝影師中了流彈，倒了下來，一個已受了致命的重傷。換個膽怯的人，這時老早跑開了，可是他却定了一定神，便立刻把攝影機對凖了汽車，每一個重要的鏡頭，都攝了進去。喬治覺得他的收穫還不够，便衝進了人叢，在南王的汽車之中，攝取了好多驚人的鏡頭。這時的南王早已面色慘白，死在汽車之中。萊蒙看見了慘案發生，最初把一切混亂擾嚷之聲收了音，接着又攝了一個循環鏡頭。麥琪弟兄倆，他們攝刺客的兇器，被一個衛兵拿在手裏，並把刺客被人衆和衛隊擊斃之後，横臥在地上，也攝了進去。慘案發生之後，秩序的混亂，人衆的喧囂，什麽都攝入了鏡頭，收進了收音機。</p>
<p>攝影收音，那時是多麽危險，但是他們的責任，絶對不能畏怯的，這張新聞片得到意外收穫之後，接着又遭過了不少的困難，一架飛機，早就預備着的，想把所攝的底片載往巴黎，在巴黎整理一下，便立刻要運往勃里門號輪船，送至紐約，可是福斯公司的代表，在拉布格脱地方是被捕了，馬賽運來的底片，全部扣留，因爲上面有命令，關於馬賽慘案的影片，一律不進運往海外。後來經過了不少困難當局審愼考慮之後，才把所有的底片發還，但所規的條件，須在法國電影檢查會監視之下，才能製片，又和當局經過了不少的爭執，才解去了桎梏，福斯公司便立刻不停留的用飛機把底片運往華盛頓號，這輪船第二天便開往美國。到了美國，更立刻用飛機送至好萊塢福斯攝影塲。迅速的製成這新聞片。在攝製的時候，經過甚多的危險和困難，但確是歷史上一頁有價值的紀載，南王的上岸，汽車的前行，被刺的情狀，亞力山大的遺容，巴爾都的慘白，一切的一切，是不可多得的新聞片呢！</p>
<p>由上文所述，我們在新聞片的本質上和攝製上，便立刻可發現幾個原則。</p>
<p>（一）新聞片可代表歷史的一頁，而且更比文字紀載容易使人得到深刻的印象。</p>
<p>（二）新聞片的價值，事前不能估定，由事件的臨時擴在或化小而昇降。</p>
<p>（三）有價值的新聞片，得以永久保存，使後人得目覩歷史上一頁的借銀幕而現實。</p>
<p>（四）拍攝新聞片的時候，事前工作人員的工作，要支配得當。</p>
<p>（五）新聞片的拍攝，由攝影師負完全責任。不像一般的影片，有導演負責，而攝影師負責較輕。</p>
<p>（六）拍攝新聞片的攝影師，非得要有冒險和勇敢的精神，就是發生了事變，也能在擾雜中態度很鎭靜的攝取影片。手法要輕快，思想要敏捷，因爲一般鏡頭拍壞了，可再換一個，甚至可連換幾個，新聞的動狀，一刹眼便幻滅，不能重演一次的，手法一遲了便拍不到，什麽應收入鏡頭，什麽可放棄，以免底片的浪費，都須隨機應變的。</p>
<p>（七）在好多的影片公司同時拍攝一種新聞片時，要出奇制勝，拍人家所來不及拍到的影片。</p>
<p>（八）底片攝成之後，運送，製作，都須神速，俾早日得以公映，用以滿足觀衆的新聞慾　，和壓倒同業的競爭。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c343">評「香閨秘密」 <a href="#c343" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e343" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">343</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>Ｗhat　Every　Woman　Knows—南京—</p>
<p>在本刊曾譯名爲「良婦箴」的「WhatEvery　Woman　Knows」電影小説，現在是以「香閨秘密」的名字開映了。前者的譯名，至少是可以表現内容，而後者却是除了香艷的誘惑之外，似乎是没有其他意義的。</p>
<p>賢母良妻主義，在美國電影片作者中還感覺十分興趣，這在「小婦人」等作品中早已表現出來。現在又將傑姆巴雷的劇作「香閨秘密」，搬上銀幕，依然是將這種主義擴大着，對於生活糜爛的現代婦人，作爲一種明顯的對照。</p>
<p>關於原著者英人巴雷（Sir　J.M.Barrie）的作品，在中國曾經　有過洪深所譁的「第二夢」（三幕劇）和「可敬的克萊登」等。被譯爲显香閨秘密」的What　Every　Woman　Konws，原爲四幕劇，在他的作品中所表現出來的是重厚的人情世味，更帶有深濃的傷感。他是老了的現代作家，他的哲學，他的陳舊的世界觀，無疑的是離開現實很遠的。</p>
<p>現在我們不妨更就整個的來觀察劇作者是怎樣的表現他的主題的罷，這在男主人公身上表現得最明顯的：他是一個倔强的男子，他好學，他刻苦，所以他雖然是一個小工，到底因着别人的帮助而在工黨競選中勝利了，而且任職内閣。然而他需要一個很好的内助，調濟他的生活，輔理他的事業，於是漢倫海斯所飾的賢妻便出現了。一個青年工人高官内閣一個賢妻在愛情各方面忍痛犧牲以帮丈夫成名，在劇作者的觀念中，當然是認爲有功於現代社會制度的了。</p>
<p>在男女主人公的比重上，自然是女主人公的謹守婦道的精神，在劇中佔着主要的地位。不過人們不會忽視，她所表現出來的認爲「每一個女人都該知道」的婦道，到底是爲了誰呢：這樣連繫着來看，更足以窺探劇作者舊的世界觀之作用了。至於爲了愛情的獲得，對於丈夫的欲擒故縱，那是在美國電影中經常可看見的，對於原有的主題並無妨碍，更神化的描寫女主人公的個性。</p>
<p>關於如上所述的主題，就我們所有到的作現程度來説，它是相當的電影藝術的地表現了劇的主題。</p>
<p>這裏有看一種特殊的風趣。在幽靜的氛園中散發出輕微的人生苦笑。特别是由於漢倫海斯演技的成功，特别是在最後一塲，那所謂通過眼涙的歡笑，確是描寫得相當深刻的。不過這一作品對於只尋求快樂的觀衆們，也許會感覺着沉悶的，譬如説笑是那般輕微，對話又是那般繁重而且枯燥，從競選時高潮過後，那些情緒緊張的塲面，如漢倫發現了丈夫的秘密等等都難於討好一般觀衆的。這裏有着悒鬱的空氣，可是悒鬱却不像無意識的大笑那般受人歡迎，雖然這裏有不少幽默塲面。</p>
<p>再要談到的便是男主角的發言很濁，雖則在動作上表現他曾經受過很好的基本訓練。至於漢倫海斯在二十六歲時的化裝，似乎嫌老一點，前部不如後部那般自然，這對於自已的年齡，不是没有關係的。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3 id="c344">「紉珠」的我見 <a href="#c344" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e344" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">344</a></h3>
<p>— 周虺</p>
<p>看過了紉珠，我不禁悵然了。我不信在這國産影片邁進的時機，還有這樣開倒車的事實呵！</p>
<p>很顯明的，作者爲了「迎合觀衆心理」，爲了「生意經」，而不惜再搬上這庸俗的，毫没有時代性的空谷蘭，這點，是認爲痛心的。</p>
<p>在演出上，「紉珠」又是失敗的，全部都是脱不了文明戲的雰園，而冗長的對白，生硬的表情，使人感不到相當愉快的。導演，在這裏，也僅做到「平鋪」的地步，絲毫没有聰明的手法。</p>
<p>關於演員方面，范雪朋根本是失敗的，陳秋風的不合個性，自然是吃力不討好的。葉秋心是有相當成就的。</p>
<p>最後，值得一説的，畫面上的發音尙還清晰。</p>

<p>— 素因</p>
<p>外面忽然有人打門，打得很急。門開了進來的不是别人，就是新郎自已。他手裏拿着一個摇鷄尾酒的銀罐，嘴裏唱着愛情的歌曲。他一面唱，一面走到曼麗的按摩床旁邊。曼麗喊道：「寳貝！」迭倫且不作聲，祗縐着眉頭看着她。一回兒他聳了聳肩膀道：唉，這一大堆亂七八糟的東西，就是我要娶作太太的女人嗎？」他又拿手措頭，從曼麗的臉上，略了一些油膏，放在自已鼻子上嗅着。他笑道：「唔，香草味的！」他然後俯身上來，吻着她的臉，弄得他自已的臉上，亦都沾滿了一層晶亮的油膏。</p>
<p>這時葆拉有些氣了。她咳了一聲，提高了喉嚨對着新郎道：「迭倫杜達，自從你六歲起，就滿處亂跑，不該來的地方亦來。」迭倫老皮老臉的道：「那是再有意思没有的事了。曼麗，你怪美的！我們何不來他一個裸體結婚禮呢？」葆拉跳出起來道：「迭倫杜達，你到底走不走。今天晚上，你也有一個童男子的聚餐哩。」這樣她們一帮子的人，由伴娘伊琳諾爾領頭，就將新郎趕出去了。曼麗等大家走了，一個人躺在按摩床上，眼望着天花板，自已思量着，她是野馬似的一個孩子，現在長大了，居然出落得像一朶鮮花一樣，就是滿臉塗着油膏，身上蓋着白布被單，都顯得嬌艷影滴的。</p>
<p>忽然電話鈴響了。曼麗躺在床上，向電話瞟了一眼，靜等着有人來接電話。但是鈴越響越急了，還是没有人來接。顯然的，葆拉走還了，聽不見了。曼麗歎了一口氣，自已從床上挣扎了起來，將被單裹住了身軀，跚蹣着一步一步走到電話桌子上，拿了電話筒聽着叫道：「哈囉……誰？誰？傑弗雷？傑弗雷？寳貝！你現在那裏？哦……哦……你快來！我有要緊的的話和你説。」曼麗斷續地叫喊着，高興得不相信自已的耳朶起來了。傑弗雷一去這幾年，居然安然回來了，現在已經到了紐約城裏了！不錯的，他確已身在紐約。他現在在碼頭上，公用電話房打電話。這是他回到祖國後，第一椿做的事情。他將自已的帽子，推在後腦，興高彩烈地對着電話機，好像他的世界，已經全在電話線的那一端旋轉了。</p>
<p>傑弗雷喊着道：「我亦有許多話和你講哩。什麽？西班牙？西班牙好得很！你告訴我，你有什麽話和我講？電話裏不能講的嗎？怎麽啦？好吧好吧。我馬上就來吧。」他掛上了電話，立即奔到外面，想叫輛汽車，到曼麗家裏去。他到了外面碼頭上；立即站住了。他看見一個身體瘦削的人，手裏拿着一頂傘，在碼頭上東張西望。傑弗雷看見了，不覺喊道：「歇伯！」那人聽見有人喊他的名字，就掉轉頭來，對着傑弗雷微微笑了一笑，然後不慌不忙地走了過來道：「還好，還好。繌算我没有誤事。我已經跑了好幾個碼頭了。」阤們二人於是拉着手，寒喧着。歇伯將一頂雨傘送給了傑弗雷道：「我本來要買花的，但是我跑到花店的老地方，那裏花店没有了，祗有一家雨傘店，所以我就買了一把雨傘送給你。」他們一面説話，一面走出了碼頭，叫了一輛汽車，一直開往曼麗家裏去了。（未完）</p>

<p>He Guoguang Says Sichuan Bandits Are Not to Be Feared</p>
<p>Liu Xiang Designates Over Fifty Counties for Opium Prohibition</p>
<p>(Chongqing) He Guoguang, Director of the Staff Delegation, leading over two hundred chiefs of various sections, staff members, and secretaries, arrived in Chongqing at 4:10 PM on the 12th aboard the "Minzhu" and "Minkang" steamers. He disembarked from the "Minzhu" steamer, docked at the pontoon dock at Tianmen Mo'er Shi. Liu Xiang, Yang Sen, and personnel from various Party, government, and military organizations and groups welcomed him at the dock. The enthusiasm was unprecedented in Sichuan. He then traveled by car to his official residence in Daxigou to rest. A reporter from the Central News Agency met He aboard the "Minzhu" steamer at Tangjiahe, thirty li downstream of Chongqing. He said that Zhu and Mao had only a little more than 10,000 remaining rifles. It is not to be feared that they would run to Sichuan, and we even hope that they will quickly fall into our trap, so that they can be annihilated as soon as possible. To suppress the bandits in Sichuan, rewards and punishments must be clearly defined, and the Party, government, and military must work together in unity so that the bandits can be quickly pacified. (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Liu Xiang has designated over fifty counties within the seventy counties of the pacification zone as opium prohibition areas. Yesterday, he ordered all financial commissioners in the area to absolutely eradicate opium seedlings. (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>

<p>Pinggu Militia Pursues Liu Bandits</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan, because Liu Guitang's remnant bandits were roaming everywhere, harassing the local people, yesterday telegraphed the 38th Division, ordering it to send troops to station in Zhuolu to prevent scattered bandits from fleeing to southern Chahar. Another group of Liu bandits who had run into Jixian and Miyun counties were jointly surrounded and attacked by the security forces and militia. As a result, they fled outside the pass, running into Jehol. There were no bandit traces within the borders of Jixian and Miyun. (Special dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) About one hundred remnant bandits who had fled from Huangyaguan in Jixian County invaded the vicinity of Zunhua, Yanshankou, and Jieshankou on the 11th. Wang Buyuan, the commander of the Second Battalion of the War Zone Security Force stationed in that county, led his troops and the militia to block and attack the bandits, driving them back and forcing them to flee outside the pass. The remnant bandits of Liu Guitang's troops suddenly appeared again in the Huangsongyu Thirty-Two Ridge area at the intersection of Pinggu and Jixian counties on the afternoon of the 11th. The militia and security forces rushed to meet and attack them. The bandits could not withstand the attack and fled east from Zhongyingzi of Chedaoling, attempting to enter Yutian County. The Pinggu militia brigade has been tracking and pursuing them, and telegraphed the militia on the Yutian border to block and attack them. (Special dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The remnant troops of Liu Guitang, entrenched in the Zhongyingzi area of Jixian County, and the bandits from outside the pass were blocked and attacked by the Second Battalion of the Jixian Garrison Security Force, together with the security corps. The bandits scattered and fled in all directions. A group of about forty or fifty fled east, attempting to harass Yutian. North of Yanshankou, they were jointly surrounded and suppressed by the police and security corps. The bandits suffered heavy casualties and collapsed and retreated. The bandits in the Zhongyingzi area also crossed Huangyaguan one after another and fled outside the pass. The security forces are still searching for the remnant bandits and preventing them from returning. (Special dispatch, 12th)</p>

Wang also said that Wang Chonghui would come to Nanjing within a few days. (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3 id="e5">The Government Invites International Journalists to Jiangxi <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>To Inspect Construction and the Truth of the Communist Bandit Disaster</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Communist bandits have occupied Jiangxi for a long time. All the original construction and agricultural villages and houses have been completely destroyed, which is a major obstacle to the political advancement of our country. Recently, Commander-in-Chief Chiang has supervised a large army to advance in several directions, successively recovering the land ravaged by the bandits. By October of last year, they went straight to the bandit's lair, eliminating the remaining bandits in Jiangxi. Our government authorities, in order to make it convenient for various countries to understand the various acts of destruction committed by the Communist bandits in the past, and the construction work after the recovery, recently initiated and organized an international journalist inspection delegation by the military and diplomatic authorities to go to Jiangxi to inspect the truth about the Communist bandit disaster in Jiangxi. All travel, accommodation, and meals for the delegation are provided by the government. There are currently twenty participants, including reporters from the United Kingdom, France, the United States, Germany, and Japan stationed in China. Some are in Nanjing, and some are in Shanghai. The reporters from various countries in Shanghai will arrive in Nanjing from Shanghai on the 15th to meet with the reporters of the delegation in Nanjing. The Nanjing press will hold a banquet to entertain them on the afternoon of the 15th. On the morning of the 16th, the entire group will depart from Nanjing on the Jiangshun steamer, not stopping in Jiujiang, and heading straight to Nanchang, arriving there on the 18th. After visiting the area for two days, they will go to various places to inspect. The inspection route has now been drawn up. First, they will go to Linchuan, then to Nanfeng, Guangchang, and Ningdu, and then take the Hangzhou-Jiangxi Railway to Hangzhou and return to Shanghai. It is expected that this trip will take two weeks. It is estimated that they will arrive in Shanghai around the 29th of this month. In addition, the Jiangxi Journalists Association recently sent a telegram to Nanjing, welcoming the delegation to visit. The Central News Agency will also send a reporter to accompany them.

<h3 id="e6">The Number of Mail Items Entering and Leaving the Pass Increases Daily <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Yu Xianglin Discusses the Significance of Resuming Postal Services</p>
<p>(Beiping) Since the restoration of postal services to the Northeast on the 10th, the number of mail items sent to the outside of the pass has increased daily, reaching about a thousand items per day. There are also five or six hundred items entering the pass. However, the postage stamps affixed and the characters written are quite inconsistent. The post office has issued another notice that it must be handled in accordance with the regulations, otherwise, all items will be confiscated. Yu Xianglin, the Postal Commissioner of Jin, came to Beiping from Tianjin yesterday and is scheduled to return to Jin on the evening of the 13th. According to him, he recently inspected Qinhuangdao and Yuguan and has now completed his work. He will leave Beiping tomorrow to return to his post. This restoration of postal services in the Northeast is purely for the benefit of the people. Since the Northeast Incident, postal services inside and outside the pass have been completely blocked. Compatriots outside the pass are isolated, unable to communicate with their relatives and friends inside the pass. Moreover, for those doing business in the Northeast, all financial transactions can amount to over ten million yuan annually, which are all handled by the post office for remittance. Therefore, since the blockade, not only has it been extremely inconvenient, but the losses have also been enormous. Considering the situation rationally and reasonably, we had to restore it for the sake of the national economy and the people's livelihood. After careful consideration and repeated twists and turns, it finally succeeded. I participated in the negotiations and know that there is no other intention besides facilitating the people. (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Jin Postal Commissioner Yu Xianglin came to Beiping to talk about the restoration of postal services in the Northeast, the significance of which is twofold: (1) to maintain the relationship between the 30 million compatriots outside the pass and those inside the pass for the exchange of information; (2) to take into consideration the loss of the 30 million compatriots outside the pass who remit funds into the pass every year. I will not stay in Beiping for long and will return to Taiyuan tomorrow evening. (Special dispatch, 12th)</p>

<p>Taking the Route to Wuliu to Meet with the Guangxi Army</p>
<p>The Remnant Bandits on the South Bank of the Wujiang River Have Been Eliminated</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Chen Jitang telegraphed, "Various newspapers report that the Communist bandits fleeing west through Jiangxi have suffered setbacks along the way, but there are still 40,000 to 50,000 remnants. If they are not annihilated in time, they will bring disaster to Guizhou and Sichuan, just as the Yellow Turbans at the end of the Han Dynasty and the roving bandits at the end of the Ming Dynasty undermined the foundation of the country. Jitang previously telegraphed the Central Government with my two brothers, Delin and Jiansheng, requesting that crack troops be drawn from Guangdong and Guangxi to form a pursuit and suppression force to cooperate with friendly forces to continue the pursuit and suppression in order to eliminate the remaining evils and pacify our country. I followed Commander-in-Chief Chiang's telegram order to approve, and my ambition to volunteer has been fulfilled. I will not hesitate to fight a hundred battles. Now, the pursuit and suppression force has been concentrated and prepared. It is scheduled to depart from Guangzhou under the supervision of Zhang Da, Deputy Commander of the Second Army, this month, to meet with the Guangxi pursuit and suppression force, set an ambush, and move forward. With the same hatred of the enemy, we will have no regrets. Once the demonic atmosphere is completely swept away, we will immediately organize the team and return in triumph. I hope that friendly forces on all sides will fight together, and the people of the whole country will respond and support us. Chen Jitang" (Special dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Wang Xunzhi said on the 12th that Li Zongren will leave Guizhou and go to Guizhou after the Guangdong army arrives in Guizhou. Bai Chongxi is scheduled to go from Yongzhou to Liuzhou in February to discuss the suppression plan with Zhang Da. (Special dispatch, 12th)</p>

<p>(Changsha) A telegram from Hongjiang said that the remaining bandits on the south bank of the Wujiang River have been annihilated by our pursuit and suppression army and the Guizhou army one after another, killing hundreds of bandits and capturing two to three thousand. They are pursuing along the highway toward Zunyi. (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Changsha) A telegram from Taoyuan said that the scattered bandits in the Yangmaotan and Sanyanggang areas were surrounded and suppressed by our army in different directions yesterday, killing more than 500 bandits. The remnant bandits scattered in all directions. Small groups in that area have been eliminated. Huangshi, Anjiahe, and Taipingqiao have all been recovered. Our army has now advanced to a certain place in the Yongjing area. In addition, our Zhang Wanxin's division has also advanced from Cili to the Yongjing area, encountering a part of the bandits at Anfupu, killing seven or eight bandits on the spot. The remnant bandits fled to Chaotianshan and Yejiabao on the border between Yongshun and Sangzhi. In addition, the bandits in the Mengdonghe area of Yongshun County are now being surrounded and suppressed by our Chen Quzhen's troops in different directions from Shixi and other places, killing more than 400 bandits. The remnant bandits fled towards Wanjieshan. (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Changsha) A telegram from Jinping said that our pursuit and suppression army and the Guizhou army have taken shortcuts to block and pursue the Zhu Mao bandit troops. The remnant bandits in the Yuanjiadu, Liangjiadu, and Jianghaijie areas have been defeated by our army in different directions, and all the places they had occupied have been recovered. The bandits in Yanmen Laodukou have also been defeated by our army in the past few days, killing over a thousand bandits and capturing countless prisoners. There are now no bandit traces on the south bank of the Wujiang River. (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Feng Shouchun, captain of the special forces of the Yutian Security Supplement Team, and Wang Bingxiao, head of the Ya Hongqiao Militia, submitted mutual accusations to the provincial authorities. Wang said that Feng intended to frame him by falsely accusing him at the Japanese army headquarters in Tangshan, causing him to be arrested and humiliated. Feng denied this, saying that Meng Xiande, his subordinate platoon leader, along with several soldiers, five horses, and five guns, went to Tangshan to handle matters. Passing through Ya Hongqiao, Wang's militia disarmed them, looted the horses, and detained the soldiers. His arrest was done by Kawasumi, a Japanese lieutenant in Tangshan, and had nothing to do with him. The provincial authorities have instructed Zhu Shiqin to investigate the matter when he goes to Yutian in a few days. (Special dispatch, 12th)</p>

<p>(Xiamen) On the night of the 11th, an incident occurred where Taiwanese resisted arrest and shot detectives, resulting in mutual injuries. It involved Wu Yougen, a Taiwanese, who committed a major theft at Huijitang. He was arrested at the Longshan Theater on the 11th. The detectives were obstructed by Taiwanese seated with him. The Detective Division immediately dispatched several teams to strictly arrest him. In the evening, Team Leader Huang Jichuan led several detectives on Datong Road and encountered Wu and more than 20 Taiwanese companions, many of whom were carrying guns. As the detectives moved to arrest Wu, Wu resisted, and Chen Lianfu, a Taiwanese, fired the first shot, hitting Huang in the right waist. The others also drew guns and fired. The detectives abandoned Wu and scattered to take cover and retaliate. For a time, a street battle ensued. Chen was shot in the waist but did not die and is in critical condition. Wu was injured in the hand and thigh. The Taiwanese took Wu to the Japanese Boai Hospital on Gulangyu, but he was not captured. Huang was taken back to the team and is in critical condition. After the incident, the Japanese Consul and Police Chief Jiafeng visited Wang Gupan, Director of the Public Security Bureau, requesting mutual restraint and calmness, pending investigation.

<p>(Tianjin) The Changyao Coal Mine near Qinhuangdao has been shut down for two years. Recently, a certain foreigner invested 100,000 yuan and intends to cooperate with the old shareholders of the mine to change it into a joint venture company. The engineer will be appointed by the foreigner, and the management rights of the entire mine will also be handed over to the foreigner. The old shareholders are half opposed and half in favor of this. In addition, the railway from Qinhuangdao to the mining area has already begun construction, but it has been suspended again due to lack of funds. The Hebei Construction Department believes that the mine's recruitment of foreign shareholders involves diplomatic issues and has ordered Yuan Tai, the magistrate of Linyu County, to investigate the details nearby and report.

<p>(Nanjing) The Tibetan postal service was established in the first year of the Republic of China and initially hired a British person to manage it. Up to now, the total postal route is about 10,000 kilometers. Due to the lack of railways and highways, postal delivery and transportation still use the courier station method. Mail carriers ride horses, which is about twice as fast as walking. There is a relay station every ninety miles, and each person travels four stations a day. A journey of a thousand miles takes a week to arrive, but it takes more than ten days in case of wind and snow. Official documents of the Tibetan government are delivered by special messengers and are not sent by mail. The Tibetan postal system has four types of services: ordinary, registered, parcel post, and money order. The minimum postage for correspondence is 7.5 fen, and the registration fee is 1.5 times that amount. For parcel post and money order, 25/1000 of the original value is charged. That is, for a value of 20 Tibetan coins, a postal fee of 5 Tibetan coins is required, and the same applies to money orders. The minimum postage stamp is 7.5 fen, divided into green, blue, and light red colors. The central image is of a lion stepping into a snowy mountain, with a sun and moon drawn on the upper left and right sides. Most are marked with both Tibetan and English characters.

<h3 id="e18">The Problem of China's Cultural Construction <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>The Necessity of Establishing More Research Institutes Quickly</p>
<p>Recently, a new awakening has emerged in domestic academic and public opinion circles regarding China's cultural construction. This is the necessity for China's academic culture to be independent. For example, Mr. Cai Yuanpei, Mr. Wang Yunwu, and Mr. Ren Hongjun have respectively advocated in the *Eastern Miscellany* and the *Education Magazine* that universities should establish research institutes so that university graduates who wish to pursue further studies do not have to go abroad for study. Furthermore, scholars in Shanghai, such as Mr. Wang Xinming and Mr. He Bingsong, have published articles and expressed their opinions in the *Cultural Construction Monthly* and the education news column of this newspaper, advocating "adopting the strengths of others and discarding their weaknesses" to put China in a leading position and seek cultural creation. This kind of awakening was not commonly seen before and is indeed a sign of progress in China's intellectual circles.</p>
<p>Since the opening of China to foreign trade, China has suffered from the invasion of foreign powers, not only losing faith in its inherent culture but also developing great doubts about the excellence of its national character. Consequently, without realizing it, people have paid sincere admiration and worship to everything foreign, while losing the confidence they should have in their own intelligence and strength. If one's spirit becomes a slave to others, then the desire to have creative abilities is like heading north to reach the south. In reality, the development of Chinese culture is less than two hundred years behind Western culture. That is, Western culture has already entered the era of mechanical industry, while we, due to our past isolation in the Far East, are still stagnating in the era of handicrafts and agriculture. As for spiritual culture, the difference is actually very small. This is a commonly recognized difference by sociologists and cultural historians. Therefore, China's backwardness today is by no means the result of the inferiority of its national character, but a temporary difference in historical development. If we can maintain faith and "catch up head-on," there is nothing we cannot achieve. Take Japan, our neighbor to the east. What culture did it have sixty or seventy years ago? But how long has it been now? It is already competing with Britain and the United States. It can be seen that if one believes in oneself and does not belittle oneself, one will surely be able to strive for progress. Therefore, in the future, if we want to seek the independence and construction of Chinese academic culture, we must take self-confidence as the key. Observing the recent speeches and proposals of the academic community, it is felt that they have a clear understanding of this point, which is really something to be congratulated on.</p>
<p>The progress of all countries in the world in terms of knowledge, thought, and technology is advancing day by day. For our country, which has always been backward, competing with them is like trying to catch up with the dust, and the sigh of being unable to reach is heard. Therefore, it is indeed difficult to seek independence in academic culture. However, if we can do our best to promote it, it is not without a solution. The most obvious is the absorption of foreign culture: (1) We should consider whether it is suitable for the current needs of the country. (2) We should follow the path of sacrificing the least and achieving the greatest effect to advance. Throughout history, our country has always regarded sending students abroad as the only way to absorb foreign culture. After completing their studies and returning to the country, they receive high attention from society, and their position is often uniquely superior. Therefore, for decades, they have been regarded as a special class in all aspects. As a result, young students all regard being able to study abroad as an honor, and they do not have time to ask whether their personal studies are suitable for the current needs of the country. As a result, what the country urgently needs are industrial and technical talents, while society is filled with talents in literature, philosophy, law, and politics. On the one hand, there is still a feeling of lack, and on the other hand, there is already a feeling of excess. It can be said that both the country and the individual suffer losses. Furthermore, although there is no shortage of students who truly want to go abroad to study in order to introduce world culture, those whose purpose is only to obtain a title actually account for a large proportion. Even from an economic point of view, it is not worth the loss. For subjects such as literature, philosophy, politics, and law, what is needed are books. With books, one can learn anywhere, without spending ten times the money spent domestically to go abroad for study. According to the latest announcement from the Ministry of Education, the number of Chinese students studying abroad in the past few years is about 3,700 or more, and those studying liberal arts account for more than 2,100. If we assume that the cost of each student studying abroad is 10,000 yuan, then the outflow of money amounts to as much as 37 million yuan. Moreover, the cost of liberal arts students is even greater than that of science students. With our country's annual trade deficit in international trade, the continuous outflow of cash, and the extremely difficult national economy, how can we bear this unplanned and uncontrolled waste? Therefore, we here hope that domestic universities will quickly establish research institutes, or expand the existing Academia Sinica, so that university graduates in the country who wish to pursue further studies will have somewhere to turn. At the same time, we must ensure that scholars who study social sciences do not have to study abroad, and that those who study science and engineering can also reduce the number of students studying abroad to the minimum. We must ensure that only those who are truly indispensable to going abroad are selected as scholars with profound knowledge to go abroad to study, or to conduct a short-term inspection. In this way, millions of dollars can be used for the equipment costs of various research institutes and academies of sciences every year.</p>
<p>With various research institutions in place, scholars can rely on them for research, experimentation, and invention. As a result, discoveries in academics and inventions in things and machinery will surely follow. Compared with the policy of studying abroad to carry knowledge, the gains and losses cannot be calculated by reason. We dare to believe that if this plan is used and accumulated over the years, it will surely enable China's academic culture to gradually advance to the realm of independence and creation.</p>

<p>Disarmament Convention and Guarantee of Austrian Independence</p>
<p>Germany's Participation as a Major Condition</p>
<p>Simon Rushes Back from Geneva to Attend Cabinet Meeting</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Simon will rush back from Geneva on Monday to attend a Cabinet meeting, reportedly the most important since the end of the European War. The Cabinet will discuss a plan under which, after Germany agrees to accept the Disarmament Convention and participate in the Danube Agreement guaranteeing Austrian independence, the Allied powers victorious in the Great War would agree to abolish the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles. Regarding this matter, there is much speculation in diplomatic circles about the attitude of the United States, because the treaty between the US and Germany stipulates that the US enjoys the rights of the military clauses in the Treaty of Versailles. If the Disarmament Convention can be established first, replacing the military clauses in the Treaty of Versailles, it is believed that the US will also, either alone or by joining the Disarmament Convention, recognize Germany's release from the military constraints of the treaty. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Simon is scheduled to leave Geneva tonight and return to the country, arriving tomorrow night. Once the Foreign Secretary arrives, the Cabinet will convene immediately to discuss (1) the Saar issue, (2) arms limitation, and (3) French Prime Minister Flandin and Laval's visit to Britain. Foreign Secretary Simon will likely travel to Geneva again within the next week. (Havas Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) The Times published an article proposing that "the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles, or a unilateral declaration by Germany, should lose their effect under certain conditions. Such unilateral action should be prevented by the countries benefiting from the Treaty of Versailles." It is reported that British diplomatic authorities are currently studying a plan regarding this issue. What The Times said is only one aspect of it. The British plan believes that if the defeated countries in the European War want the victorious countries to abandon the rights contained in the treaty clauses, they must submit a formal request to the League of Nations. A formal request can only be accepted if made by a member state of the League of Nations. Supporters of this plan believe that only in this way can other countries' promises regarding Germany's equal rights to armaments and Germany's return to Geneva be simultaneously realized. That is, negotiations on an international convention limiting armaments can only proceed smoothly in this way. (Havas Telegram, 12th)</p>

This is the first time since the establishment of the Administrative Council that it has issued a statement to the people of a particular region in the form of a declaration. The declaration states: "As Saar citizens prepare to vote, the League of Nations Administrative Council solemnly urges residents to adopt a calm and dignified attitude to demonstrate their awareness of the importance of this event, and to maintain the same attitude after the vote, and to await the Administrative Council's adoption of appropriate decisions in the shortest possible time." This morning, the Saar Regional Administrative Commission also reported to the League of Nations that the people's emotions were extremely excited, requesting action to inform the Saar people that the Administrative Council would continue to preside over everything and would not be negligent from the time the referendum results were announced until the consequences occurred. Now that the Administrative Council has extended the term of the three-person committee and directly issued a declaration to the Saar residents, its effect should be to stabilize people's minds.

It was decided to extend the powers of the Saarland Three-Person Committee (appointed by the Administrative Council last year, composed of Italian representative Aloisi, Argentine representative Cantilo, and Spanish representative Madariaga). The purpose of this decision by the Administrative Council is to inform the Saar residents that all procedures regarding the interpretation and implementation of the referendum results will be handled by a supervisory body of a transcendent nature (i.e., the Three-Person Committee) specially entrusted by the Administrative Council.

<p>Saarbrücken, Saarland It is believed here that after the Referendum Committee reports the referendum results to the League of Nations Administrative Council, the Administrative Council will take various decisions, and its session will inevitably be extended for some time. The issues that the Administrative Council should resolve are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The issue of the Saar region's sovereignty before the implementation of the referendum results. (2) Determine the date of the transfer of sovereignty with reference to the Saar Three-Person Committee's report of December 5 last year. According to the report, if the referendum results decide to return to Germany, the transition period should be at least one month. (3) The date of withdrawal of international troops. (4) The nationality and rights of Saar residents, and the right to choose nationality. (5) Other related issues, such as (A) the status of Saar regional civil servants. Regarding this, the Administrative Council passed a resolution on May 17, 1933, recognizing the original rights of civil servants, which should be guaranteed regardless of the referendum results. (B) Social insurance and property transfer methods when residents leave the area. (Havas Telegram, 12th)</p>

<p>German Front Has a Better Chance of Winning</p>
<p>The Force of the Maintaining Status Quo Faction Is Also Not Weak</p>
<p>Saarbrücken, Saarland Tonight, the anti-National Socialist newspapers are all headlined with optimistic words, including "Tomorrow we will defeat Hitler," and "Liberate ourselves from Germany's grasp," "Use maintaining the current situation to defeat Hitler." Now, those who enthusiastically support Hitler also admit that if there are too many votes supporting maintaining the current situation, it will greatly damage the German leader's prestige. If such votes exceed 25 percent of the total votes, it would be truly shocking, and the League of Nations would also have difficulty in deciding whether to hand over the entire Saarland to Germany. Supporters of returning the Saarland to Germany hope that their votes will account for 80 percent of the total votes, but the opposition laughs at this, saying that this number is too high. The German Front has a good chance of winning, because the Saar people have a very strong sense of national identity. Today, the only obstacle to a major victory for the National Socialist Party is the uncertain tendency of Catholics. As for the united front of the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, it is feared that it will be difficult to obtain 100,000 votes out of 540,000 votes. A certain Catholic newspaper that opposes Hitler today announced to its readers that the Pope has ordered the Saar Catholics to follow their conscience, but it is feared that many Catholics will regard patriotism as more important than everything else. At present, everyone is convinced that the referendum will not be hindered by riots, but the military and police are very closely guarded, without the slightest relaxation. Today, there is a heavy snowstorm here, and most enthusiasts are staying at home, so there is no crowd to welcome voters when they arrive at the polling stations. The surrounding areas of each polling station are heavily guarded by police, cavalry, and infantry. Today, only those who cannot go to the polling stations tomorrow due to official duties are allowed to vote. (Reuters Telegram, 12th)</p>

The newspapers also do not want to make too many predictions or say anything that is favorable to Germany. Preparations for welcoming the Saarland back to the motherland have been completed, and it will be called "The Saarland Returning to Germany." The newspapers attribute the easing of the tense situation in the Saar region in the past few days to the effective response of the German Vanguard Corps.

They lodged a serious protest and requested the Administrative Council to intervene quickly. As the referendum is imminent, the National Socialist Party's demonstrations have become increasingly rampant. The police in Saarbrücken are intimidated and have shown their support for the National Socialist Party. Fortunately, the Saar Administrative Committee has strictly supervised them to maintain order. Today, about 10,000 people have come here from Germany to participate in the vote, and the streets are blocked. Hundreds of National Socialist Party members are specially stationed at the station to welcome the guests, take care of them, and give them food, lodging, and money. Therefore, those who come to the Saarland from other places to participate in the vote are recruited by the National Socialist Party after getting off the train and join the National Socialist Party. On the contrary, the pro-status quo faction's request to welcome them at the station was not approved, so they made many complaints. The international troops posted a notice today, with very gentle wording, but British staff officer Mctaggart gave an interview to the press, saying that the international troops are on alert at all times, ready to assist the local police in maintaining order. According to the Referendum Committee, documents have now been obtained proving that the National Socialist Party is suppressing voters. The National Socialist Party has distributed forms to the homes of voters, ordering them to fill out whether they will go to vote, and if they give up voting, they must explain the reasons. The National Socialist Party is afraid that people will fear retaliation and give up voting, so there is this coercive action. The Referendum Committee has solemnly warned the leaders of the German Front and said that the National Socialist Party's organized acts of terrorism and suppression are indeed damaging the trust of people all over the world in the integrity of the referendum. After consultation between the Referendum Committee and the leaders of the National Socialist Party, a final decision was reached, that is, when the League of Nations Administrative Council decides the fate of the Saarland region, it should pay special attention to the process of competitive voting. If the National Socialist Party uses coercive means, the Administrative Council will consider whether to recognize the validity of the votes obtained by coercive means. (Havas Telegram, 11th)</p>

<p>Saarbrücken, Saarland The referendum results will not be announced until the morning of Tuesday next week, because if they are announced on Sunday night, it will be easy to cause disturbances due to the darkness at that time, and order will not be maintained. The Saar police are now almost entirely inclined towards the National Socialist Party, so the international troops will be fully responsible for maintaining order on the two days of voting and vote counting. When the ballot boxes are sent to the Waldorf for vote counting, strict precautions have been taken along the way. The pro-French and anti-Hitler factions of the Saar people are mostly terrified, and some who want to maintain the current situation do not dare to go out at night, fearing that they will be attacked by the National Socialist Party.

<p>Saarbrücken Social Democratic leader Blanc appealed against the rampant terrorist acts, asking the Saar Referendum Committee to postpone the vote, resulting in rumors, but it is learned that this request will be rejected. Officials are convinced that there will be no disturbances during the vote, but they do not want to be negligent in their preparations, so there are various arrangements to prevent things in advance, such as not allowing the National Socialist Party to welcome the thousands of voters who came here from Germany today. These people come from outside the country, are taken care of by the police, and are assigned accommodation. (Reuters Telegram, 11th)</p>

<p>(London) The British ambassador to Germany recently made an informal suggestion to the German government that Germany should send a delegation to Geneva to accept the League of Nations Administrative Council's resolution on the Saar Referendum. Germany has now rejected this suggestion, but British officials do not consider this to be strange. Before Britain made the suggestion to Germany, it consulted with France and Italy. The most important thing in the diplomatic discussions on this matter now is the conditions under which Germany can return to the League of Nations. According to sources here, French Prime Minister Flandin and French Foreign Minister Laval will soon visit London, and this trip is highly valued because it holds the hope of Germany rejoining the League of Nations.

<p>Saarbrücken On December 16 of last year, a British police officer hired in the Saar region, Justice, was driving on the street late at night and, due to a misunderstanding that he was threatened by the crowd, opened fire with a handgun in self-defense, causing a Saar person to be slightly injured. The police officer was later dismissed from his post for investigation. The preliminary investigation of this case has now been concluded, and the prosecutor has decided to exempt him from prosecution. (Havas Telegram, 11th)</p>
<h3 id="e67">Saarland's Return to Germany Will Affect Heavy Industry <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Saarbrücken The "Grenzland" weekly published some secret reports by experts to the board of directors of various factories in the city of Neunkirchen, which are generally considered to be surprising. According to the report's observation, once the Saarland region decides to return to Germany, the factories will be affected in various ways. If the Saarland returns to Germany, the French border will be closed, preventing German metallurgical products from being easily imported. If this happens, German industry will lose its sales to France. The conclusion also states that the Neunkirchen steel mill, in which the two major German industrialists Ulf and Gurlmen have invested heavily, will increase its annual burden by 5,715,000 marks once the Saarland is under German rule. Its operating income will only be enough to cover some depreciation expenses. The reason is that the Saarland industry is tied to the French tariff system, and without iron sand from Lorraine, France, the Saarland steel mills will not be able to continue working. The only way to save it is to continue to maintain French sales. The report says that there is a possibility of engaging in beneficial negotiations on this matter, as France sells goods worth 120 million francs to the Saarland, while purchasing goods worth only 80 million francs from the Saarland. The report concludes: "The Saarland heavy industry should not allow the German Front to carry out propaganda at will in its factories, oppress workers, and organize nationalist demonstrations in the Chamber of Commerce. Once the Saarland returns to Germany, they will have to advise the board of directors of the following facts: (1) The return of the Saarland to Germany is tantamount to the destruction of heavy industry. (2) The return of the Saarland to Germany is tantamount to increasing unemployment and reducing wages. (3) The return of the Saarland to Germany is tantamount to economic suicide."

<p>Rome The newly appointed Chinese Ambassador to Italy, Liu Wendao, told reporters today, "The friendship between China and Italy has a long history, but China's diplomatic relations with Italy are closer than ever because of sympathy and admiration. Mussolini's deep impression is beyond words. The brief meeting has moved me by his personality and the Fascist movement. Our country also resonates with the enthusiasm of Mussolini and his brown-shirted comrades. China's political life is seeking a point of convergence with Italy." As for the commercial relations between China and Italy, Ambassador Liu said that although the world is suffering from economic panic, Sino-Italian trade is developing. Ambassador Liu concluded that China has made great progress and reforms, and the authority and prestige of the central government are also different from what they were three years ago.

<p>Control of Manchukuo's Economy and Reorganization of the South Manchurian Railway</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The issues that the Office for Manchukuo Affairs will handle include the reorganization of the South Manchurian Railway, the Manchukuo-Japan Economic Conference, and the Manchukuo colonization plan. In order to maintain close contact with the various provinces, the authorities have decided to establish a Council of Advisors and a Conference of Administrative Officials. The following policies are to be adopted for the above-mentioned issues:</p>
<p>(1) South Manchurian Railway Issue After soliciting opinions from various parties, the most appropriate reorganization method will be devised. The timing of the reorganization has not yet been determined, but when the negotiations for the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway are successfully concluded and the Eastern Railway is managed by the South Manchurian Railway Company, the Manchurian transportation agencies must be reorganized, so this time will be the most appropriate time for the reorganization. (2) Manchukuo-Japan Economic Conference The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently investigating concrete cases. This conference is located in Changchun, so the Office for Manchukuo Affairs will send specialists to Manchukuo to liaise with Japan. (3) Manchukuo Colonization Issue The security of "Manchukuo" can generally be maintained, and it has now reached the stage of developing industry.

<p>Fourteen People Arrested in Chiba</p>
<p>Accused of Being Suspected Spies</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Yesterday, the Chiba Prefectural Police Department secretly ordered police stations within the prefecture to arrest overseas Chinese and send them to the police department before 8:00 AM on the 13th. Today, fourteen overseas Chinese were unreasonably arrested and successively escorted to Chiba, the prefectural capital. It is said that the reason for the Japanese police's arrest of the overseas Chinese is the false accusation that they are suspected spies. After the arrest, they will be forced to return to their home country in the form of voluntary repatriation, without taking the form of deportation because there is no legal basis for deportation. Among the arrested overseas Chinese, the most resided in the military stronghold of Tateyama. It is said that because the Japanese police have no legitimate reason to deport overseas Chinese, they plan to successively accuse them of being spies and sweep away overseas Chinese from military strongholds throughout the country.

<p>Sunspots Emit Electromagnetic Force</p>
<p>Capable of Making Human Minds Anxious and Irritable</p>
<p>(Paris) Maurice, the director of the Baojian Observatory, observed the sun and moon today with a huge telescope and predicted the crisis of a latent world war in 1936 and 1937. Maurice claimed that he does not believe in astrology, and his prediction is based on astronomy. Maurice said that sunspots constantly emit electric and magnetic forces. This electromagnetic force can make people restless and irritable, so that the smallest international disputes can lead to war. Maurice also cited the history of the 1900 war to prove his theory. When the sun is still, the world can celebrate peace and prosperity, and people devote themselves to art and culture. The early periods of 1900, 1910, and 1920 were periods when the sun was still. However, after sunspots appeared, wars broke out in the world. Sunspots appear on the sun once every eleven years. The Moroccan War in 1905 and the World War in 1914 also coincided with this solar activity. Maurice also stated that sunspots can also cause other disasters. In 1936 and 1937, the world will also experience gales, earthquakes, gout, and heart diseases. Maurice concluded that only the sun and moon in the universe can affect the earth, the sun because of its large size, and the moon because of its closest distance to the earth.

<p>A Major Threat to Monetary Policy</p>
<p>(Washington) The lawsuit over whether the abolition of gold clauses is illegal was debated in court today. The plaintiff, Norman, holds bonds of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad, claiming that the bonds contain a clause for payment of principal and interest in gold, which should not be canceled according to the Constitution. Therefore, he requested that the railroad company be ordered to pay the debt interest of $22 in gold. Attorney General Cummings appeared in court on behalf of the government to defend the case and requested the court not to conclude the case until the government had submitted the required documents to the court. Chief Justice Hughes of the Supreme Court spoke about the government's free public bonds, which promised to be paid in a certain currency, and made a shocking statement, saying, "According to this public bond, where do you have any power or congressional power to change this promise?" This was addressed to Cummings. The verdict in this case is not expected to be released until around February. (Reuters Telegram, 12th)</p>

<p>(Washington) Silver supporters in the House of Representatives are paying close attention to the Supreme Court's handling of the gold case. If the court's ruling is unfavorable to the government, then the method of recoining silver coins to devalue the US dollar will be more powerful. Representative White told a reporter from the Associated Press that he plans to propose a bimetallic standard and set the ratio of gold to silver at sixteen to one. If the court's ruling is unfavorable to the government, then recoining silver coins will be the only way to solve the currency problem. White also stated that raising the price of silver to $1.25 per ounce is necessary for economic recovery and that Senator Pittman's wartime silver purchase law has increased prices here. The situation in the East is better than ever before. He believes that the Treasury Department's policy towards China should consider the fact that China uses silver to purchase American goods.

<p>Chinese Overseas Suffer Losses of Seventy Million Dollars</p>
<p>Change of President Leads to Return of Chinese Overseas to Mexico</p>
<p>(Mexico Correspondence) There are approximately over 60,000 Chinese overseas in Mexico. Those engaged in business were making substantial profits. Various businesses were mostly run by Chinese. However, since 1932, anti-Chinese sentiment in Mexico became increasingly intense. Chinese stores and farms in Sonora, Sinaloa, and Chiapas were almost completely looted by Mexicans. The losses in property and businesses of Chinese overseas reached sixty to seventy million dollars. More than two hundred people died, and many were deported. After the anti-Chinese sentiment erupted, the Kuomintang branches in various cities telegraphed the National Government to protect Chinese overseas. In the spring of 1933, the central government sent Huang Yunsou as envoy to Mexico. After Huang's arrival, he signed a commercial and protection treaty with Mexican President Cárdenas. Recently, the anti-Chinese sentiment in Mexico has begun to subside. Chinese overseas who had been deported are returning to Mexico from places like Taishan, Guangdong, to make a living. The current Mexican President Cárdenas cares for the overseas compatriots and is different from the former President Calles, who was cruel and tyrannical. (December 12th)</p>

<p>Establishment of Yugu Transfer Bureau Facilitates Mail Transit</p>
<p>Mail in the South Manchurian Railway Zone Remains Under Old Regulations</p>
<p>Preparation for Scheduled Implementation of Remittances and Parcels Underway</p>
<p>(Beiping Correspondence) The postal service in the Northeast, which had been suspended for two and a half years, is now being restored under certain conditions. The Huitong Transfer Bureau, responsible for the transfer tasks, has established general and branch offices in Shanhaiguan and Gubeikou, which were officially established at 10 a.m. on the 10th. The Hebei and Beiping Postal Administration issued a circular on the 9th to all post offices under their jurisdiction, stating that starting from the 10th, they would officially receive and dispatch international mail to and from the Northeast and via Siberia. All international mail will be handled in accordance with international postal regulations. The postal service in the South Manchurian Railway Zone has always been subject to separate treaties and is collected by Japanese post offices. Afterwards, Chinese stamps must be affixed before they can be sent to inland areas. Those without stamps affixed will be penalized according to the underpayment method. After the resumption of postal service, the old regulations will remain in effect. Forged organization stamps and special stamps are not applicable. Mail from areas in the Northeast outside the Railway Zone for inland destinations must use special stamps. After arriving at Shanhaiguan and Gubeikou, the Huitong Transfer Bureau will handle the transfer. Any mail with forged organization stamps will be considered invalid and will be checked by the Transfer Bureau. Only after another type of stamp is affixed can it be delivered inland. For the convenience of settlement, all accounts will be settled by the Hebei Postal Administration and the Huitong Transfer Bureau, even though Shanhaiguan and Gubeikou belong to the Hebei and Beiping postal districts, respectively. The Beiping district and the Hebei district Postal Administration will then settle the accounts themselves through transfer methods. The post offices in Shanhaiguan and Gubeikou will retain their old names, while the post office on the other side in Shanhaiguan will be renamed the South Suizhong Post Office, and the Gubeikou side will be renamed the South Luoping Post Office, to avoid confusion. The special stamps have already been printed by the other party and are divided into four types: 2 cents, 4 cents, 8 cents, and 12 cents. The size is similar to our stamps. The Chinese price is printed in the upper left and right corners of the stamp, and the English price is printed in the lower two corners. Only the two characters "郵政" (Postal Service) are printed in the middle of the bottom. In terms of patterns, the 2-cent and 8-cent stamps have floral borders with a blue floral auspicious grain pattern in the middle. The 4-cent and 12-cent stamps have a Mount Changbai pattern. Postal service began on the 10th. Due to time constraints on that day, both parties only received letters, so Beiping had not yet received any incoming mail. Incoming and outgoing mail began on the 11th. The procedures for remittances and parcels are more complicated and require time to prepare. It is scheduled to be implemented on February 1st. Currently, the Huitong Transfer Bureau is rushing to print documents and preparing all procedures to ensure timely implementation. All accounts will also be directly settled by the Hebei Postal Administration and the Huitong Transfer Bureau. The handling and transfer by the Huitong Transfer Bureau is a trial. If there are difficulties, reforms will be made at any time to achieve perfection. The bureau charges commissions and does not collect other fees. Any profits or losses are unrelated to the Postal Administration. (10th)</p>

Fang arrived in Jinan at 4:35 p.m. today (the 10th) on the Pingpu train No. 306. Provincial Chairman Han Fuju and various party and government officials welcomed him at the station. After getting off the train, Fang went to the Jiaoji Hotel for a temporary rest.

<p>Conducting In-depth Investigation of Main and Tributary Water Conservancy in Henan and Shaanxi</p>
<p>Chiang and Zhang Telegraph the Three Provinces' Authorities for Assistance</p>
<p>(Hankou Correspondence) The National Economic Commission's Jianghan Engineering Bureau, in order to survey the water conservancy, production, trade, and transportation conditions of the main and tributary basins of the Yangtze and Xiang Rivers, as the basis for planning and measuring the water conservancy, has specially organized two teams, the Yangtze River Survey Team and the Xiang River Survey Team. Chen Zhangguan was appointed as the captain of the Yangtze River team, Xu Shuping as the engineer, Li Eqi as the captain of the Xiang River team, and Sun Weibo and Yan Shouren as the engineers. The teams are divided into three groups, departing separately to conduct on-site surveys. The survey sites, in addition to the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River basin and Sichuan and Jiangxi, the Xiang River basin needs to be traced upstream, reaching dozens of counties in the southern parts of Henan and Shaanxi. Wherever the main and tributary rivers of the Hanshui River pass, the surveyors should be present. The source of the river is mostly located in the mountainous areas where the two provinces or two counties meet, which happens to be the area where the troops are currently encircling and suppressing bandits. Fearing that the local troops and county governments may refuse to provide protection when the survey team approaches the source of the river, which would prevent this important task of tracing the source from proceeding smoothly, Yang Silian, the director of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, telegraphed Chairman Chiang and Vice Commander Zhang (Xueliang) for instructions. On the 10th, Chiang and Zhang jointly telegraphed the governments of Hubei, Henan, and Shaanxi, and the military authorities, strictly ordering the county governments and local troops to provide special protection and assistance to the team. It is reported that the survey team is scheduled to depart from Hankou within a few days. According to the person in charge of the Jianghan Bureau, in addition to surveying water conservancy, dikes, production, trade, and transportation conditions, other aspects such as labor, materials, education, etc. will also be investigated, as the basis for reorganizing and developing the Jiangxiang water conservancy. Therefore, the mission is extremely important. (10th)</p>

Liu's relatives and friends here deeply regretted his passing. Liu never engaged in production, so his situation in recent years was not very prosperous.

Nan and Liu's orphans will take the train to Taiyuan at 11 p.m. today (the 10th). The various situations are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Liu Kongxiu, Liu's nephew, is studying at the Law School in Beiping. The reporter drove to visit him this afternoon (the 10th). Liu's daughter, Jinyun, had just arrived in Beiping from Tianjin and was packing her luggage with tears in her eyes. After expressing condolences, the reporter heard Miss Liu say, "My father was always in good health. He has been engaged in the revolution for decades, loves sports, and has no habits of smoking or drinking. This time, he was dispatched to accompany Minister Huang (Musong) to Tibet to pay respects to the Dalai Lama, which has been seven months. I never expected him to die in a foreign land, which we never anticipated. Before he left, my grandmother was still alive and strongly advised him not to travel far, but my father refused. Within two months of my father's departure, my grandmother passed away. Her coffin is still in the hall. We originally intended to bury her after my father returned, but I didn't expect such an accident to happen. According to the telegram from the Beijing side, the cause of my father's death was a stroke, perhaps due to the climate there. We are all young and have suffered a major disaster. Our minds are in chaos. We plan to return to our hometown tonight to handle everything according to my mother's instructions. However, my father was negligent in saving due to his engagement in the revolution, so our family is in a difficult situation. Thinking about the future, we are truly worried. After we return to our hometown and make some arrangements, we will transfer to Jinjing to pay respects to Minister Huang (Musong). As for the aftermath, we rely on the elders to plan for us." Miss Liu was unable to continue speaking at this point and burst into tears. Her grief was sincere and deeply moving. Liu's nephew, Liu Kongxiu, was also sobbing at his desk. After offering some consolation, the reporter left sadly.</p>
<p>After receiving the bad news from Lhasa, Liu's old friends in Beijing immediately sent a telegram to Beiping, reporting to Liu's son Kongzhang and nephew Yesiu, and offering warm condolences. The original telegram read, "Liu Kongxiu and Liu Kongzhang, Law School, Elephant Workshop Bridge, Mongolian Communications Office, Translated and Transferred: We have just received a telegram from Lhasa from Jiang to Yiyang (7th) stating that Old Man Pu suffered a stroke in the morning (6th) while riding a horse. After being treated by a doctor, he did not regain consciousness for a day and a night. He passed away at 5 a.m. on the morning of Yang (7th). Friends here are deeply saddened. We believe that you, brother, are sincere and will undoubtedly be overcome with grief. However, we believe that your father died for the country and has no regrets. We hope you will control your grief and take on major responsibilities. In addition to friends here jointly planning the aftermath, we are sending a telegram to express our condolences. If necessary, we will send another telegram to invite you, brother, to Beijing. Tang Kesan, Wu Heling, Ba Wenjun, Liu Funong, Xiong Yaowen, Yu (7th)." Liu was a native of Shenchi County, Shanxi, and was 53 years old. His wife is 40 years old and has one son and three daughters. The son, Kongzhang, is 21 years old and is studying at Beiping High School. The eldest daughter, Jinyun, is 25 years old and is studying at the Tianjin Municipal Hospital Nursing School. The second and third daughters live with their mother in their hometown. Liu has a cousin, named Kongxiu, who is 24 years old and is studying in the Department of Law at the Beiping Law School.

<p>Aimed at Improving the Porcelain Industry</p>
<p>(Nanchang Correspondence) The porcelain of Jingdezhen, Jiangxi, is very famous in history and in the world. In the past, Europeans called porcelain "文那 (Wen Na)," and after the opening of maritime transport, the annual sales were always in the millions of dollars. Recently, foreign porcelain has stolen the show, coupled with natural and man-made disasters in the country and various influences, the porcelain industry has declined and fallen sharply. The number of Jingdezhen kiln owners who open kilns is less than half, and the number of unemployed workers is also increasing daily. All sectors of the country are paying close attention to this industry. Those who have gone to inspect one after another. All sectors of the province, in order to revitalize the porcelain industry and reverse the decline, in addition to selecting a large number of famous porcelain to participate in the Chicago Exposition last year, (4) also held a porcelain exhibition in Nanchang. Participants include the Jiangxi Porcelain Company, Jingdezhen Vocational School, and dozens of local Chinese stores in the city. The venue is in the Zhongshan Hall of the Yuzhang Park. There are slogans at the entrance saying, "Chinese people should use Chinese porcelain," "Chinese people should improve Chinese porcelain." The hall is winding and full of porcelain, all of which are products of Jingdezhen and local porcelain shops in the city, about tens of thousands of pieces, worth four to five hundred thousand dollars. The porcelain is priced lower than the market price. The opening ceremony was held at 10 am on the 7th. Hundreds of guests attended, chaired by Director Gong of the Construction Department, followed by the chairman of the Jiangxi Porcelain Improvement Society, Chen Changming, reporting on the preparations. He said, "We have seen that the porcelain industry, which has been glorious in the world for thousands of years, is declining. Therefore, we have gathered various porcelain merchants in Jingdezhen to form a porcelain industry improvement society. But if we want to improve, we must first examine its shortcomings. Therefore, we have decided to make a thorough review through the exhibition. This time, the collection of items, styles, calligraphy, and paintings should have everything. In order to revive Chinese porcelain and promote Chinese porcelain, we must not fail this exhibition." Finally, the chairman of the City Chamber of Commerce, Xu Ruifu, and others gave speeches, and then Director Gong's daughter cut the ribbon.

<p>In recent times, groups of refugees from Henan and Jiangbei have been passing through the four villages of this county, begging for food. Often, the composition is complex, and there are times when they overstep the boundaries of their actions and gather to demand things. The villagers cannot bear the harassment. For example, the family of Cao Shaocun, a farmer in the 21st Tu of the Xinwu Ku Town, was broken into and harassed by Funing refugees the night before yesterday. They took the opportunity to rob him, stealing ten silver dollars and a fur coat. Fortunately, the neighbors rang the gong to warn, and the refugees fled. The villagers chased them in groups and intercepted three men and two women, who were taken to the town police station and then transferred to the county. They gave their names as Pan Shusong, Mao Jinyu, Pan Lianjin, Zhang Dengshi, and Pan Caishi. They did not admit to the robbery. The case was transferred to the county court for investigation. It is learned that Xia, the wife of the victim Cao Shaocun, was scalded in her lower body and is in great pain. The violence of the refugees is evident. It is also reported that 300 refugees from Henan arrived in Shihu Dang Town today (the 12th), men, women, old and young, gathered to cause trouble. After receiving a telegram from the town's merchants, the county government ordered the Public Security Bureau to send inspectors to the countryside and the 12th Security Brigade to send a squad of soldiers, and the Water Patrol Special Affairs Bureau to send two patrol boats to quell the situation.</p>

<p>Zhao Lihua, the director of the Provincial Department of Finance, because the provincial treasury is in arrears and has no way to make up for it, found that the new and old arrears of land tax in this county reached 300,000 yuan. He then sent Commissioner Chen Naixun to Changshu to urge the collection. Unexpectedly, Commissioner Chen has been in Changshu for two months, but due to the poverty of the local area, the amount collected has not increased. Now, the Department of Finance believes that the amount of tax paid by this county is extremely short, and specially ordered Commissioner Chen to complete all old arrears from the 16th year to the 22nd year within this month, and must collect 10,000 yuan per day. Now, Commissioner Chen, after receiving the order, has joined the county government to strictly pursue the arrears from the people and officials and complete the payment as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The weather in this county has been abnormal recently, with continuous rain for months, so the sale of rice in the market has been sluggish. In addition, the money supply is extremely tight, and many households have no way to pay. The storage of goods is abnormally crowded, resulting in a continuous decline in market prices. High-quality goods can still barely be maintained, but medium and low-quality goods cannot be hoarded, and no one is interested in them, so the decline is very sharp. Yesterday's market price of new brown japonica rice was 10 yuan and 8 cents to 8 yuan and 8 cents, new brown indica rice was 10 yuan and 4 cents to 8 yuan and 2 cents, new white japonica rice was 12 yuan to 10 yuan and 5 cents, and new white indica rice was 11 yuan and 7 cents to 8 yuan and 4 cents.</p>

<p>Total Estimated to Reach Over Five Million Bags</p>
<p>Supply Exceeds Demand, Rice Prices Decline Again</p>
<p>Dagon News reports that the Soybean and Grain Association in this city, due to the continuous arrival of foreign rice in China affecting the rural economy and the economy of the same industry, has sent letters to various foreign firms undertaking the rice trade, requesting them to investigate the actual numbers, and then warning the same industry to restrict orders. The various situations are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e138">Letter to Foreign Firms <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Dear Sirs,</p>
<p>Upon investigation, this past year our country experienced a poor harvest of rice, leading to a shortage of rice grains. In Zhejiang Province, excluding the rice-rich areas of Wenzhou and Taizhou, it is estimated that there is a deficit of two million shi (石). Jiangsu Province faces a deficit of one million shi (石). Anhui Province has a slight surplus, while Hubei and Hunan Provinces are generally self-sufficient. Jiangxi Province is able to supply itself. According to these statistics, there is an approximate deficit of three million shi (石). Consequently, Chinese merchants are actively purchasing foreign rice to alleviate the situation. Current estimates suggest that foreign rice orders have reached five million bags, an astounding figure. If this estimate is indeed accurate, it will inevitably lead to a significant surplus, potentially causing drastic market price fluctuations in the future. Merchants will suffer losses, and foreign firms will also be adversely affected. Furthermore, the total value of five million bags of foreign rice would be around fifty million yuan. In this time of financial distress and economic decline across various sectors, difficulties in capital turnover are inevitable. Our association, considering these circumstances, is deeply concerned and intends to conduct a precise statistical analysis to prevent future problems. Therefore, we earnestly request that Your Firm provide, within three days, a detailed breakdown of the total amount of foreign rice ordered from Your Firm in Shanghai and Ningbo since last autumn, including: the amount that has already arrived; the amount that is en route but has not yet arrived; and the amount that has been ordered but has not yet been shipped. We kindly request that this information be provided accurately so that we can assess the situation and ensure safety. This matter concerns post-disaster management, so we hope that you will promptly respond accordingly. Sincerely, To [Name of Foreign Firm]. Enclosed is a survey form; please complete and return it to our Association.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Total Amount of Foreign Rice <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Following the issuance of survey forms to various foreign firms in this port by the Bean, Rice and Grain Trade Association the day before yesterday, the Association received reports yesterday from Arnhold, Karberg &amp; Co., Jebsen &amp; Co., Sincere &amp; Co., Gilman &amp; Co., Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., Carlowitz &amp; Co., Jardine Engineering Corporation, Andersen, Meyer &amp; Co., A. E. Ullmann &amp; Co., and China Import &amp; Export Lumber Co. The total amount ordered in Shanghai is 365,610 tons (each ton contains ten bags, totaling 3,656,100 bags, each bag weighing 180 jin by the market scale, equivalent to 1.2 shi by the market measure). The total amount ordered in Ningbo is 114,000 tons (totaling 1,114,000 bags). The firms handling the most orders are China Import &amp; Export Lumber Co. and Jardine Engineering Corporation. However, eight foreign firms, including Dodwell &amp; Co., Wing Tai, Heng Feng, Taisoo, Kam Lung, Cheung Mow, Paolung, and Taifung, have not yet submitted reports to the Association. In total, the actual amount of foreign rice ordered by local and foreign rice merchants, as well as financial institutions, must be over five million bags. All of these orders were placed between September and October of last year.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Continued Orders This Year <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Rice merchants and financial institutions in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, as well as this city, have ordered foreign rice from Saigon, Siam, and other locations. Over two million bags arrived in Shanghai last year, and over three million bags with a later term will arrive at the end of January or early February of this year. A reporter from the Ta Kung Pao investigated the rice market yesterday and learned that since the stock market opened on January 3, rice merchants in this city have continued to order approximately 800,000 to 900,000 bags of foreign rice for later delivery in April and May.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Rice Prices Drop <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The price of rice in this city, especially the best white rice, exceeded the price limit a few days ago. Secondary No. 3 rice and foreign Kexian rice also rose in price, causing unusual public panic. However, starting from January 9, prices suddenly fell, and have continued to drop in recent days. The current selling price for top-grade rice is 13 yuan, secondary-grade rice is 12.3 yuan and 11.23 yuan, South Bank secondary-grade rice is 10.23 yuan, and foreign Kexian rice is 10.08 to 10.09 yuan. Compared to last week's market prices, these represent a drop of more than half a yuan. According to rice industry leader Zhu Zixiang, who spoke to a reporter from the Ta Kung Pao, there are three reasons for this decline: (1) The Lunar New Year is approaching, leading to tighter credit; (2) Purchasing power is weak; (3) Foreign rice is arriving in Shanghai in a steady stream. According to the survey on the loss of harvest caused by last year's drought, approximately three million shi (石) needed to be supplemented. However, the amount ordered by the industry and financial institutions has exceeded this number. This year, the supply of rice will exceed demand, and rice prices will inevitably plummet, not only significantly affecting the industry but also causing substantial losses to farmers.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Late-Night Meeting <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Since Sanpei (三北) insisted on including Mingxing (明興) in the alliance agreement, but the allocated profits would be reduced, while Taikoo, China Merchants and NingShao (寗紹) and others firmly disagreed and petitioned the Navigation Administration Bureau not to issue Mingxing (明興) navigation certificates, the two sides insisted fiercely. On the evening of the day before yesterday, the director of the Navigation Administration Bureau, Peng Hu (彭瑚), summoned Liu Hongsheng (劉鴻生) of China Merchants, Yu Qiaqing (虞洽卿) of Sanpei (三北), and Yuan Ludeng (袁履登) of NingShao (寗紹), etc., to the Navigation Administration Bureau for an emergency meeting. Director Peng (彭) persuaded both parties to make concessions to each other. The meeting lasted for five hours. The discussion was very secretive, and a solution was not reached until late at night.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Settlement Plan <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Although the resolution cannot be made public, according to the reporter's investigation, when discussing the opposition of the three companies to the Mingxing (明興) wheel joining the Shanghai-Ningbo line, Liu Hongsheng (劉鴻生) of China Merchants proposed that Sanpei (三北) lease Mingxing (明興) to China Merchants, which Sanpei (三北) also agreed to, but the issue of management rights was not resolved, so the discussion was changed to the handling of Mingxing (明興) wheel. As a result, roughly, "the Shanghai-Ningbo four companies stipulate that each company should send only one ship for navigation, and no more ships should be added." The company sent ships to replace them, and the general situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e144">Collision of Japanese Ship <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The Xin Shengjing (新盛京) wheel is a regular passenger ship on the North China Sea route. Recently, due to the silting of the Baihe River in Tianjin, most ships to Tianjin only go to Tanggu. After the ship arrives in Tanggu, passengers and cargo are transferred to Tianjin, and the ship stays at the Tanggu wharf to load cargo bound for the south. It was originally scheduled to leave Tanggu on the 11th. On the 10th, when loading cargo, a Japanese merchant ship suddenly arrived in Tanggu. Due to careless navigation, it crashed into the Xin Shengjing (新盛京) wheel. Xin Shengjing (新盛京) was at anchor, and when the ship crashed into it that day, it could not avoid the collision, and was damaged. The outer hull of the ship was damaged. The detailed damage situation was not described in detail in the Shanghai telegraph, so it is still impossible to know the truth. It will only be clear after the ship arrives in Shanghai. Fortunately, the engine room was not affected, so it was still able to depart from Tanggu and come to Shanghai.</p>

<p>Reporters from this newspaper inquired at the company, and it was said that the Xin Shengjing (新盛京) wheel was severely damaged in the collision with the Japanese ship this time. The company has sent a telegram to Tianjin to inquire, and has decided to unload the cargo and suspend operations after the ship returns to Shanghai, and to carry out major repairs in the factory. As for the sailings that the Xin Shengjing (新盛京) wheel should have made, the company will deploy the Daming (大名) wheel to replace it.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Postal Administration to Move to Beijing This Month <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Savings and Remittances Administration Also Scheduled to Move Next Month</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Shanghai Sichuan Road Bridge Postal Administration and the Postal Savings and Remittances Administration, after receiving orders from the Ministry of Communications to move to Beijing, the Postal Administration has begun to move in batches, and the entire move can be completed by the 20th of this month. As for the Postal Savings and Remittances Administration, it was originally scheduled to start moving next month, but due to practical difficulties, it may not be able to complete the move on schedule. The following is a statement from Xu Baiyuan, Deputy Director of the Savings and Remittances Administration:</p>
<h3 id="e148">The General Administration Moves to Beijing <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Xu told a reporter from the Central News Agency that the Ministry of Communications originally set February 10 as the date for the relocation of the Administration to Nanjing, but the initial plan was to allocate a portion of the buildings built by the Postal Administration for use. Now, because these buildings have all been allocated for other uses, and the internal organization and scale of the Administration are more complex, there is no space available for the Administration to use. The Administration is now planning to find suitable buildings in Beijing to serve as the Administration's office, but it has not yet been found, so the date of the move is difficult to determine before it is found. If suitable buildings can be found in the shortest possible time, the Administration can move to the capital for office within February.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Expansion of the Shanghai Bureau <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Xu also told reporters that after the Administration moves to Beijing, the organization of the Shanghai Bureau will be slightly expanded compared to the current organization. In the past, the Shanghai Bureau and the Administration worked in the same place. The Ministry of Communications ordered that the original work of the Shanghai Bureau be transferred to the General Administration for management in order to save expenses. However, the savings and remittances work in the Shanghai area is quite heavy, so after the Administration moves to Beijing, the Shanghai Bureau must restore its original state in fact.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Rural Investment <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>When asked about the Administration's investment in rural areas, he replied that the Administration is happy to invest in rural areas, but the Administration's organization is slightly different from that of banks. At present, various banks have set up branches in the interior to handle rural investment, which is more convenient. The Administration mostly entrusts postal bureaus in the interior to handle savings and remittances, which is already extremely busy. There is no time to take care of investment matters. If the Administration establishes an investment management agency in the interior, it will also be beyond its economic capacity. Therefore, the Administration's investment in rural areas will cooperate with banks in the future, but this matter is still under planning, and will only proceed after the planning is completed.</p>

<p>The Statistical Office of the Ministry of Industry sent a staff member to Shanghai to visit and study industrial production issues and recent trends. Yesterday, a letter was sent to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce stating that the Office is currently studying industrial production issues to clarify recent trends. It has specifically selected about 20 larger factories in Shanghai and sent Qian Desheng to visit. It is feared that manufacturers may not understand the situation and misunderstand, so the staff member was ordered to contact your association first. Please investigate and provide guidance and introduce us to the manufacturers properly to facilitate the work and avoid misunderstandings.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Match Industry Tries to Reverse Business Decline <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the business of domestic matches has been sluggish recently. Manufacturers from various provinces have held meetings in Shanghai to jointly seek relief. It has been decided that all factories in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hubei, and Anhui provinces will proceed with merger procedures to avert the crisis. Reporters from the Central News Agency, because the match factory is one of our country's industries, and is especially necessary for the daily use of the general public, and is very important to people's livelihood, visited Mr. Gao Songfu, a member of the National Match Industry Federation, yesterday to inquire about the situation of the match industry. According to Mr. Gao, our country's match factories have produced both sulfide phosphorus and safety matches. In North China, such as the provinces of Shandong, Henan, Hebei, Beijing, Suiyuan, Gansu, and Shanxi, red-headed sulfide phosphorus matches are mainly sold. In South China, such as the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Sichuan, Yunnan, etc., black-headed safety matches are mainly sold. However, the cost of sulfide phosphorus matches is about one-third lower than that of safety matches. In recent years, the production of sulfide phosphorus matches has been greatly excessive, so they have expanded their sales force in the northern part of Jiangsu, Anhui, and Hubei provinces. The original sales area of safety matches is therefore easily squeezed and changed. Also, considering the demand for matches in the provinces of Austria, Guizhou, Fujian, Sichuan, and Yunnan, it has mostly been supplied by manufacturers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. In recent years, it has also been affected by the encroachment of foreign goods and the crackdown on provincial control. The original sales area of safety matches has not only been squeezed and changed, but also suddenly shrunk, resulting in a situation of overproduction, leading to a gradual and tragic drop in market prices, which has become more and more severe. The sluggishness of its business is unprecedented in the past years. According to investigations, the safety matches produced by manufacturers in the six provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi are about 270,000 cases per year, while the demand for safety matches by the people of the six provinces is about 210,000 cases per year. According to this, the number of safety matches that are overproduced each year is about 60,000 cases. This is still in terms of the production volume of manufacturers in the six provinces. If each factory is calculated to produce as much as possible, the annual production of safety matches is about 500,000 cases, which can exceed the actual sales volume by more than double. If the government is not requested to restrict the establishment of factories, and the industry does not restrain production, then the match industry will never be optimistic. Therefore, manufacturers from various provinces have risen up to find ways to seek relief. In addition to requesting the government to limit the establishment of new factories to provide assistance, they have also advocated mergers and joint operations, flat-price sales, and triangular agreements to limit production and other methods. Currently, He Shichang, Sun Runzhai, and Xi Jianqing of the match industry are leading manufacturers in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Hubei to organize the Preparatory Office for the Merger of Eight Factories of the Great China Match Company, located in the China Merchants Building on Edward Road, Shanghai. The Minsheng Match Factory in Suzhou has heard of this and has also requested to join. In the future, after the Guangming Match Factory in Wenzhou participates, it will become a company merged by ten factories, and will implement various plans such as agreement and joint operations. The decline of the domestic match industry may be saved.</p>

<p>Lhasa Radio Station Completed</p>
<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, our country's border provinces have always been hindered by traffic congestion and political isolation, and foreign countries often issue various provocative messages, causing misunderstandings between the central government and the local governments of the border provinces. At the same time, foreigners use the transmission of the above-mentioned inaccurate information as a basis for their policy of eroding our border provinces. The government authorities, in view of this, specifically ordered the Ministry of Communications to plan and expand the border province's electrical administration to correct what is heard. According to information from the transportation industry in this port, regarding the expansion of the electrical administration in the border provinces, Huang Musong's special envoy carried wireless machine parts with him when he entered Tibet to pay tribute to the Dalai Lama. A main radio station was first established in Lhasa, and in the future, several branch stations will be established in the front and back Tibet. The Lhasa radio station has been completed and will be able to communicate with Shanghai this month. In the past, telegrams had to be transferred by British India. Now, there is no need to delay the transfer, and the tricks of foreign countries to alienate them can also be reduced from now on.</p>

<p>According to Xinxin News Agency, Jicheng Gongji Pharmacy on Nanjing Road in this city was unable to circulate funds due to the sluggish market and the accumulation of inventory. In addition, depositors went to withdraw deposits one after another, which could not be met. On December 28 of last year, the board of directors of the pharmacy entrusted lawyer Yang Linzhi to temporarily declare a suspension of business. Now it is known that the company convened an emergency shareholders' meeting at No. 40 Ningbo Road at 2 p.m. yesterday, with 56 people including Chu Minyi and Tu Kaizheng attending, with more than three-quarters of the shares. Most of them advocated the resumption of business on the issue of the company's suspension of business. In particular, Mr. Chu Minyi was most concerned about the company's resumption of business. It was said that the new pharmaceutical industry in our country is in a new era of development and should be actively developed, or it may be possible to regain the rights and interests of the pharmaceutical industry. If a Chinese pharmacy goes bankrupt, it will reduce a sales channel, so it is hoped that general creditors will express their consent to the resolution to resume business, and business can resume.</p>

(2) If creditors accept half of the company's issuance of priority shares, the company should issue priority shares immediately and apply to the competent authorities for approval in accordance with the law. The rights of the priority shares are subject to the provisions of the original plan. (3) If creditors are unwilling to express their consent before the 25th of this month, or if those who express their consent do not reach more than three-quarters of the amount of debt, the company will be liquidated and liquidated immediately, and accountant Wang Sifang and lawyer Yang Linzhi will be selected as liquidators.</p>

<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, Jiangsu Bank, considering the economic decline in the country in recent years, has been making every effort to adjust financial services for various industries, especially focusing on providing assistance to agricultural areas in Jiangsu Province. Recently, recognizing the oppression of small inland merchants by high-interest loans, it has collaborated with Jin Cheng and Peasant Banks to jointly establish small loan offices in Zhenjiang, providing low-interest loans to small industrial and commercial businesses to alleviate their difficulties. At the same time, it is striving to promote the flow of finance inland.

<h3 id="e176">An Earthquake Will Occur in Shanghai Around Noon on the Fifth of Next Month <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Originating from Crustal Movement</p>
<p>Unrelated to Volcanic Activity</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Xujiahui Observatory in Shanghai reports that an earthquake is expected to occur in Shanghai around noon on February 5th of this year (the second day of the Spring Festival). This earthquake is believed to be caused by movements within the earth's crust and is not specifically related to volcanic activity. It is due to the movement of rocks along fault lines within the crust. Geologists have long asserted that the earth's crust was initially formed by lava, which either solidified or boiled, undergoing repeated changes. The boiling action caused various substances to coalesce, with lighter substances floating and heavier substances sinking. The major continents of the world are generally composed of lighter rocks such as granite. Therefore, it is said that Asia's vast weight and the rock layers at the bottom along the fault lines, due to the influence of pressure, have layers that are nearing decay or have already decayed (decay does not mean pulverization; the bottoms of continents and oceans are connected), causing external pressure to force and compress parts of the internal substance to come closer together, thus causing an earthquake. The seismic waves radiate outward from the epicenter and transmit to the ground.</p>

<h3 id="e180">28 Chinese Cotton Mills Petition for the Suppression of Cotton Speculators and Monopolies <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Seeking to Maintain the Balance of Cotton Yarn Prices</p>
<p>According to Guowen News Agency, 28 Chinese cotton mills, including Wing On and Weaving &amp; Spinning, jointly petitioned the government and the Shanghai Municipal Government yesterday, stating: "Petitioning for the suppression of speculators who are destroying real industry, which cannot be delayed. We sincerely request a decisive action to safeguard the national textile industry." The petition stated that cotton has been expensive and yarn has been cheap in recent years, causing cotton mills to suffer losses and lack vitality. However, speculators, knowing that domestic cotton production is insufficient for factory use, continue to raise prices and hoard, resulting in a growing gap between the prices of cotton and yarn at the yarn exchange, preventing a balance. The danger facing the yarn industry cannot be ignored. In all countries with cotton production in the world, the exchange has never simultaneously priced both cotton and yarn, fearing that the disparity in value would hinder the textile industry. However, the Shanghai Chinese Cotton Yarn Exchange is different. Cotton and yarn are auctioned at the same time, with cotton standardized to domestic cotton, allowing speculators to succeed in their monopolistic manipulation. The price of cotton rises higher and higher, while the price of yarn lags behind. According to the current market conversion of cotton bids to yarn prices, each bale of cotton yarn loses more than 20 yuan. For several months, cotton mills across the country have suffered from this situation. Speculators only seek private gain, disregarding the overall situation, knowing that even if the price of raw cotton is raised to an extremely high level, factories cannot stop working; even if the price of yarn is at a huge loss, factories cannot stockpile and not sell. As long as the factories continue to operate, they have to reluctantly buy expensive cotton and sell cheap yarn, facing a dilemma. The life of cotton mills across the country is entirely in the hands of a few organized speculators. The urgency of the matter cannot be overstated. If the government does not provide swift relief, the whole situation will collapse in the near future. Once the opportunity is lost, it will be too late to take remedial measures. Therefore, we sincerely petition your esteemed government to dispatch officials to Shanghai to conduct a thorough investigation of the situation. At the same time, we request that the Chinese Cotton Yarn Exchange be ordered to maintain a balance between the prices of cotton and yarn. If the manufacturing cost of 20-count standard yarn, converted from the market price of 430 jin of standard cotton (excluding taxes), is less than 45 yuan, the auction should be stopped immediately until the market price returns to a reasonable difference. This is an urgent and immediate solution. We earnestly implore you to adopt it and implement it to relieve our predicament. We deeply pray." The petition was presented to the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Industry, and the Shanghai Municipal Government by the following petitioners: Wing On Factories 1, 2, 3, and 4, Weaving &amp; Spinning, Shen Hsin, Heng Feng, Qingdao Huaxin, Xie Feng, Da Tong, Min Feng, Tong Cheng, Yu Feng Su Lun, He Feng, Da Sheng Factories 3 and 1, Three Friends, Min Sheng, Zhen Tai, Bao Xing, Da Cheng, Hong Zhang, Fu An, Pu Yi, Heng Da, Da Feng, and Zhen Hua.</p>

Those unwilling to take the re-examination should apply for retirement benefits within the deadline, stating in writing that they are unwilling to take the examination again and returning their old, invalid practice certificates.

<p>To Discuss New Construction Plans with Shanghai Business Leaders</p>
<p>Last year, leading figures in China's business community, including Guo Shun, Wu Yuncho, Hu Juewen, Li Yanshi, Hu Xiyuan, Qian Chengxu, Cai Shengbai, and Li Yuncheng, accepted the invitation of Chairman Han of the Shandong Provincial Government to visit Shandong and inspect production and construction, as well as the Yellow River water conservancy projects. After returning to Shanghai after more than a month, they had an excellent impression, and the proposals they made were adopted. This year, the Shandong Provincial Government, with the various construction projects nearing completion and the new plans for the twenty-fourth year, has specially appointed Zhang Honglie, Director of the Construction Bureau, to come south for a return visit with the business leaders and conduct specific research on the development of the Yellow River water conservancy projects and various issues regarding cotton planting. According to the news released by the China General Chamber of Industry, a telegram has been received from Chairman Han stating that Director Zhang will depart on the 12th, first going to the capital to discuss matters with the Economic Commission. After a short delay, he will proceed to Shanghai via the Beijing-Hangzhou Highway, arriving around the 20th of this month.

<h3 id="e184">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Cables for Clarification of the Stamp Duty Standards for Three-Part Forms <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce cabled the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: "To the esteemed Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, on the 11th of this month, we received a letter from the Biscuit, Candy, and Canned Goods Trade Association stating: 'Respectfully, the Guanshengyuan Company informed us that when a transaction is completed at the store's retail section, an invoice is issued in the three-part invoice book, with the first part given to the customer, the second part given to the accounting department for verification, and the third part kept for record. Regarding the method of affixing stamps, it is natural to affix sufficient stamps to the first invoice in accordance with regulations. However, we would like to request your Chamber to forward a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for clarification as to whether stamps should be affixed to the second and third parts and whether stamps should be affixed to the cover of the original invoice book in order to have something to follow.' Based on this, we are hereby forwarding the situation and requesting your esteemed Chamber to promptly review and reply so that we can forward it accordingly. Invoices are issued for the needs of customers, and according to regulations, only one copy is required. The company uses a three-part format for record-keeping purposes. The second and third parts are copies and should not be affixed with stamps. Furthermore, the three-part invoice is bound into a book and covered with a cover. Although the form is similar to accounting books, the effect of the invoice is independent on each page. Therefore, stamps should be affixed to each page individually, which is different from accounting books that use one year as the start and end date and affix stamps to each book. Since stamps are affixed to each page of the issued invoice, there is no need to affix stamps again to the cover. In order to ensure that the methods are consistent, we hereby cable your esteemed Ministry to approve and circulate this for the merchants to follow, which will be convenient for all. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>

<p>The Tongsheng steamer of Datongxing Steamship Company in Shanghai, which was carrying over 3,000 tons of coal from Qingdao to Shanghai, ran aground outside Wusongkou on the 10th due to heavy fog and getting lost. The company immediately hired four Huidefeng tugboats to rescue it. However, because the ship was heavily loaded and deeply embedded in the mud, it was impossible to rescue it. The coal was then unloaded to allow the ship to float. It is now learned that after this procedure, the ship was successfully towed out and entered the port at 4 PM yesterday. After inspecting the ship, there was slight damage, but nothing major.</p>

<h3 id="e189">Case of Wu Hua Bank Nears Conclusion <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Huang Linsheng Appeared in Court to Present the Progress of Liquidation</p>
<p>Zhang Chaozu Repeated the Trial and Arguments Concluded</p>
<p>After the Shanghai branch of Wu Hua Bank, located at 130 Ningbo Road in the Public Concession, and the Eight Immortals Bridge branch in the French Concession simultaneously went bankrupt on August 21st of last year, Zhulonggen, Chen Xianji, Luo Lihua (female), Shi Pengfei, Duzhiji, Shibilong, Shen Peng, Zhou Delin, Wang Fulin, Pan Yuanji, and ten other creditors of the two branches jointly hired lawyers to file a private prosecution in the Criminal Court of the Second Special District District Court, accusing the managers and assistant managers of the two branches of Wu Hua Bank, Fan Shaoliang, Wang Jian'e, Ye Haitian, Wu You, Xie Shunzhi, Tang Songshan, counselors Tang Shoumin, Chen Bingqian, and eight others of breach of trust and fraud, using the advertisement of the five-year and ten-year savings plans to promote the absorption of deposits, and failing to register with the National Government before opening. They requested that the case be investigated and dealt with according to the law. The case was originally heard by Judge Zhang Chaozu. The first hearing was postponed because the defendants had not appeared. Later, Judge Zhang was transferred to the High Branch Court, and Judge Xiong Huiping took over the case. He held two hearings to summon the defendants, who all appeared in court with their defense lawyers. Huang Linsheng, the representative sent by the Guangzhou head office to Shanghai with full authority for liquidation, also appeared in court and stated the progress of the liquidation, stating that the accounting books could be liquidated and compiled in about two weeks for submission to the case, as reported in previous newspapers. Now that Judge Zhang has returned to the Special Second Court, yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhang convened both parties to continue the hearing, announced the renewal of the trial, questioned the plaintiffs about the grounds for their prosecution, and the defendants' confessions, which were roughly the same as reported previously and will not be repeated. The court also summoned Huang Linsheng, the representative sent by the head office, who stated that he was 41 years old, from Guangdong, and was previously the supervisor of students studying in Japan in Nanjing. Two days after the Shanghai branch of Wu Hua Bank went bankrupt, the head office sent a telegram to Nanjing, asking me to represent the liquidation. After I arrived in Shanghai, due to internal disputes, after many twists and turns, I started receiving liquidation. I then sent the branch manager and important staff members to work with the lawyers and accountants hired to manage the accounts. According to the branch managers Fan and Wang, there is a profit of over 100,000 yuan, which is roughly consistent. Now, we are urging the collection of debts, and those who do not pay have been sued. In the future, we plan to first repay the savings deposits and then repay the various current accounts. As for the registration issue, the head office is in Guangzhou. At that time, the revolutionary government had only Guangdong, and the organization was not complete, so we registered with the Finance Department. Later, for the convenience of developing abroad, we also registered with the Hong Kong government. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that there were several points that needed to be investigated. After the branch went bankrupt, two Xiang Sheng cars were hired to move items at the branch. The police checked at the time. Furthermore, the head office allocated 250,000 yuan of capital to the branch, but the plaintiff knew that 220,000 yuan had been withdrawn, which means that the head office had no capital. Also, regarding the registration issue, it was just said that it had been registered with the foreign government of Hong Kong, which should also be certified by the consulate. These three points should be investigated in detail. At this point, after reviewing the previous files and various evidence, the court believed that the evidence was complete, and then ordered the opening of arguments. The eleven lawyers from the plaintiff and defendant each argued, and then the court ordered the conclusion of the arguments and scheduled the sentencing for the 19th. It was already 7 o'clock when the court adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Private Postal Agencies Still Being Penalized <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Even with Stamps Affixed and Canceled by the Ningbo Post Office</p>
<p>Because Post Office Cannot Reach All Locations Simultaneously</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications, because private postal agencies were hindering the development of the postal service, ordered all private postal agencies to cease operations from January 1st of this year and not to collect or deliver letters. However, on the 9th of this month, Lu Youtong, an employee of the Shanghai Postal Administration, discovered Zhang Xiuhe, a messenger from the Baoshun Private Postal Agency at 366 Jiujiang Road, delivering letters in Jiu An Li, Yunnan Road. He reported this to the police and Zhang was detained by the General Police Station. After questioning by the police chief, in addition to submitting 108 letters and checks to the First Special District Court for seizure, the owner of the Baoshun Agency, Dong Fufa from Ningbo, was summoned to be prosecuted. This was reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Chinese detective Gao Yanrong summoned Dong Xiangfa and Zhang Xiuhe to the Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer Zhang Shizhu clarified the case and filed a lawsuit according to Articles 5 and 27 of the Postal Regulations, requesting punishment according to the law. When questioned, Dong Xiangfa confessed that the Baoshun Private Postal Agency was operated by Lin A Si, and I was employed as an accountant. We have now stopped operations in accordance with the order. These letters are from the Ningbo Money Dealers Association. Because the post office often delivers letters at the same location in the morning and afternoon, and cannot reach all locations simultaneously, a temporary solution was agreed upon with the Ningbo Post Office. The letters from the Money Dealers Association were affixed with sufficient postage and sent to the post office to be canceled, and then taken to Shanghai by ship and delivered by me. This was permitted by the post office, so the detained letters were all affixed with postage and stamped by the post office. The Shanghai Flower Trade Association is also currently using this method. When questioned, Zhang Xiuhe confessed that he was employed by Dong to deliver letters and knew nothing else. The presiding judge Zhan Liangce immediately asked Lu Youtong, the representative of the post office, whether the post office in Ningbo had allowed this to happen. The answer was that this would never happen. The court asked why the letters were all stamped by the post office. The answer was that this may be because some small employees who did not understand the reasoning believed that since sufficient postage had been affixed and the postal revenue had not been reduced, it would be fine to deliver the letters themselves, so they stamped them. This was actually an error in procedure. After Judge Zhan verified the confessions, he announced in court that Dong Xiangfa was found guilty of operating a postal business and fined 80 yuan, and Zhang Xiuhe was found guilty of assisting and fined 40 yuan. If they cannot pay the fine, they will be sentenced to imprisonment, with 2 yuan equivalent to one day. The detained letters will be delivered to the addressees by the post office in accordance with the postal regulations.</p>

<p>Guo Xinren Dies from Serious Injuries</p>
<p>Cai Bukui Confesses to Revenge</p>
<p>Regarding the violent fight among dock ruffians near the Yongyu Yarn Factory in Caojiadu, Huxi, by the Suzhou Creek around 10 AM the day before yesterday, which resulted in four seriously injured individuals, one of whom was in critical condition, and the arrest of three suspects including Cai Bukui by the police, as reported in yesterday's newspaper, it is now known that Guo Xinren, 29 years old, from Bao'ying, Jiangbei, died at 11:20 AM yesterday in the Red Cross Hospital due to three knife wounds to the head. The hospital notified the Caojiadu branch bureau, and Director Wang immediately dispatched police to instruct the local officials to report to the local court for inspection. Meanwhile, the other three injured individuals, Xu Zuozhi, Zhang Fucai, and Chen Xuegu, were treated by doctors with bandages and medication before being detained at the bureau. Bureau member Liu interrogated them separately. According to Xu Zuozhi, 30 years old, from Bao'ying, this morning he was buying melon seeds from a woman named Dong Cuiying at the dock and had a slight argument. Unexpectedly, Cai Bukui led dozens of followers, each carrying sharp blades and iron bars, and rushed over, violently beating and slashing them, resulting in a severed right finger and leg injuries from the bars, rendering him unable to move. Xu Maoren, 50 years old, stated that Zuozhi is his son, and his account was similar. Zhang Fucai and Chen Xuegu also stated that they and Guo Xinren, upon seeing Cai and his gang attacking Xu, stepped forward to mediate but were instead attacked with stabs and beatings, resulting in two or three knife wounds each and bar injuries to their backs. Cai Bukui, 37 years old, from Bao'ying, confessed that Xu Zuozhi and his gang had been acting lawlessly at the dock, extorting one yuan from each arriving ship. When he tried to intervene the other day, they gathered a gang and destroyed the furniture in his shop. Therefore, he beat them in retaliation. The woman, Dong Cuiying, provided a similar statement. After obtaining the confessions, the bureau member considered the case to involve loss of life and specially prepared documents to be submitted to the Public Security Bureau for review.</p>

<p>After the ceremony, Chen Jicheng reported on his deeds, saying, "Today is the memorial service for Martyr Pan Hongsheng. Representatives from all walks of life have come to attend the memorial service because they deeply regret the martyr's passing. This shows the general sympathy. Regarding the martyr's deeds during his lifetime, there are many things that are worth commemorating. Now, I will give a brief report below. Martyr Pan was born in Wuxi County, Jiangsu Province. He was upright by nature. In the 14th year of the Republic, when he was 13 years old, he was studying in Qingdao. It happened to be the time when the May 30th Incident occurred in Shanghai. He knew that we must unite sincerely in order to resist foreign insults, so he invited his classmates to raise donations and appeal everywhere. It can be seen that he had a deep sense of national consciousness when he was alive. He came to Shanghai the following year and studied at Fufeng Paper Company. Soon after, the September 18th Incident occurred. After hearing the news, he was so angry that he wanted to die, so he joined the Shanghai Civilian Volunteer Army for training. The following year, the Japanese invaders invaded Shanghai. He was ordered to assist the 19th Route Army in fighting in Baoshan. After the ceasefire agreement, in June, he graduated from the 19th Route Army training and returned to his old job. Unexpectedly, at that time, dishonest merchants in the city were competing to sell enemy goods, disregarding shame. He held a bullet warning and was arrested and sentenced to six years in prison. Unexpectedly, he died last year due to excessive injuries." After the speech, Wu Zhihao, Shen Tianxin, and others delivered speeches one after another. The meeting adjourned at 4 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Relatives of Victims of the Tongfu Wheel Surrounded Lawyer Zhang Henghai Yesterday <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Demanding Additional Compensation</p>
<p>They Were Dispersed After Police Suppression</p>
<p>Dagong She reports: "A Tongfu Wheel of the Tongan Shipping Company sank off the coast of Mokpo, Korea, in October last year after being hit by a hurricane. No crew members survived. Bao Anfu, the manager of the company in Shanghai, rushed to Japan immediately after receiving the news and entrusted the Japan Maritime Rescue Society to try to salvage the ship. However, the ship could not be found. After two weeks, more than 10,000 gold coins were spent. Because the seabed off the coast of Mokpo is extremely deep, it is not easy to search for once it sinks. After this news reached Shanghai, the families of the Tongfu Wheel crew members were all in Shanghai. They immediately organized a group and negotiated with lawyer Zhang Henghai, the agent of Bao Anfu. At that time, because the insurance money for the wheel had not yet been received, Bao Anfu lacked funds for compensation, so the negotiations were fruitless. Recently, Bao Anfu received the insurance money in Japan and remitted more than 7,000 yuan, and also wrote to lawyer Zhang Henghai to represent him in distributing compensation to the crew members. Lawyer Zhang immediately published a notice in the newspaper to inform the families of the victims to go and collect the money. This advertisement was published yesterday. Unexpectedly, at about 8 AM yesterday, the families of the victims, supporting the old and carrying the young, went to lawyer Zhang's office at No. 692 Niuzhuang Road. Unexpectedly, more than 100 people gathered. The amount of compensation set by Bao Anfu was a maximum of 750 yuan and a minimum of 180 yuan, which they said was not satisfactory. Lawyer Zhang replied that this amount was calculated based on ten times the monthly salary of each person. If they wanted to increase it, he had no right to agree. He had to telegraph Bao Anfu to get his consent before he could do so. However, the families demanded that the increase be issued immediately. So they surrounded Lawyer Zhang in the office. At that time, there were many people talking and the order was chaotic. They confronted each other until about 3 PM. Lawyer Zhang happened to have just recovered from a new illness and had not eaten all day. He was in a terrible state. He had no choice but to send a clerk to report to the Old Gate Patrol Room. The patrol head dispatched a detective to stop them, telling them that obstructing freedom violated criminal law. At that time, the families of the victims, seeing the detective arriving, began to leave one after another. The detective thought that the families of the victims were extremely pitiful, so he did not arrest them. It was not until about 4 PM that the detective protected Lawyer Zhang and sent him home for dinner, while the elderly, weak, women, and children were still guarding the office. It was not until the lights of thousands of homes were lit that they had not yet dispersed."</p>
<h3 id="e204">The Case of Lin Yujin Suing Sheng Yuchang for Abandonment Was Heard Once Yesterday <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Research on Repeated Cohabitation</p>
<p>The Defendant Flatly Denies</p>
<p>Sheng Yuchang, 38 years old, the eldest grandson of Sheng Xingsun, the former Minister of Posts and Communications of the Qing Dynasty and a native of Changzhou, lives at No. 1 Beidang Road, French Concession. He was recently sued by Lin Yujin, a Guangdong woman living upstairs at the Jinhua Pharmacy at No. 291 Xiafei Road, for abandonment, with an attached civil lawsuit to recover 50,000 yuan in maintenance fees. After receiving the complaint, the court had summoned the defendant twice through Judge Xiong Huiping. The defendant also hired a lawyer to defend him. Because the witnesses had not arrived, the court ordered to postpone the hearing to summon the witnesses again, and ordered the plaintiff Lin Yujin to submit to a medical examination at the forensic office to check the condition of her lung disease for verification. The plaintiff's lawsuit and the defendant's defense intentions have been described in detail in previous reports. Yesterday, the case was summoned for continued hearing. The plaintiff hired lawyer Hua Maosheng as her agent. She was assisted by relatives and neighbors to the court because of her illness. The defendant also went to court with his defense lawyer to wait for the hearing. Judge Zhang Chaozuo opened the second criminal court to hear the case. After questioning both parties about their age, residence, and occupation, the plaintiff's lawyer stood up and stated that the plaintiff was seriously ill and came to court reluctantly today and could not stand. He requested a chair to make a statement. The court approved it and announced a new trial. According to the plaintiff Lin Yujin's statement, when I was sixteen years old, I was originally a prostitute in a brothel. After being introduced by a Mr. Su, I met the defendant and married him as a concubine in the first month of that year. We lived together for more than two years. Because the defendant had many concubines, I could not stand the squeeze. I left and had no way to make a living. I spent my days dancing in dance halls. In the year the Japanese fought, I met the defendant in the dance hall in October. He came with his concubine. Because I was sick, I asked the defendant to help me out of compassion. The defendant ordered his concubine to give me 200 yuan. He came again the next night. He told me that he could restore my previous status. Later, I rented a house with him at No. 291 Xiafei Road. He gave me expenses ranging from 200 to 300 yuan per month until March of this year (referring to the lunar calendar), when he suddenly disappeared and stopped paying the daily expenses. I am now seriously ill. He cruelly abandoned me and had no choice but to sue him. The defendant Sheng Yuchang admitted that he married the plaintiff as a concubine in the 11th year of the Republic and lived together for more than a year. In the year the Fengzhi War occurred (i.e., the 13th year), she voluntarily left. I tried to persuade her to stay, but she refused, so I let her go freely. I have not seen her since. There was no such thing as meeting in the dance hall, giving 200 yuan, or renting a house together. The officer asked the defendant if she was suing you because she was sick and pitiful. Can you give her some money to settle the matter? Sheng replied that he could not admit it. At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer stated that the landlord Chen Zhang and neighbor Cao Fusheng were in court today and requested to call them as witnesses. The court immediately called Chen Zhang to the stand. According to her statement, Lin Yujin is my tenant. She lives with a servant. I went to her room two or three times to collect rent. I saw the defendant sitting in the room. Cao Fusheng stated that I have lived upstairs in this house for four or five years. Lin Yujin lives in the front building. I have seen the defendant's face about ten times. When they rented the house together, I saw it. Once, when the defendant came, because the maid lived on the third floor, I went to open the door and let the defendant in. The officer asked the defendant again if he knew the two witnesses. He replied that he did not know them and had never seen them before. At this point, the officer ordered the debate to begin. After the lawyers of both parties debated with each other, the court ordered the debate to be suspended because the case still needed to be investigated and ordered to wait for a scheduled re-hearing.</p>

<p>Reply from Wuchang Has Not Arrived</p>
<p>The Officer Ordered a Stop to Visitation</p>
<p>Tang Jiapeng, a Ningbo native and former manager of the Great World Amusement Park, was shot and killed in front of the Great World at about 1 AM on the morning of June 18 of the year before last. At the same time, a pedestrian, Wu Guangcai from Yangzhou, was killed by stray bullets. After the incident, the French Patrol House apprehended two suspects, Zhang Tinggui and Zhao Guangfu, confiscated a handgun, and sent them to the court. Zhang was sentenced to 20 years in prison, and Zhao was sentenced to life imprisonment, with each being deprived of their civil rights. Zhang's sentence has been finalized and he has been sent to prison. Zhao is still appealing to the Supreme Court. Recently, Chinese and Western detectives from the French Patrol House arrested Wang Xinggao (39 years old, a native of Funing, living at No. 46 Menggu Road, Zhabei), a key suspect in the case, in Room 537 of the Central Hotel on Guangdong Road on the evening of December 13 of last year. He was brought together with the already captured Zhang and Zhao for questioning. After the investigation was completed, he was transferred to the Second Special District Court, and a public prosecution was filed against him for premeditated murder. Judge Xiong Huiping opened a court for interrogation on December 26 of the same month. Because Wang denied participating in the instigation of the murder and stated that he was a warden in the First Prison in Wuchang, Hubei that year, he was ordered to be detained pending the transfer of documents to the Wuchang Court in Hubei for investigation. After the reply arrives, the hearing will be held again. This has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday was the date for the continued hearing. Judge Xiong presided over the first criminal court. Lawyer Gu Shouxi appeared in court on behalf of the Police Department, and the defendant's defense lawyer also appeared in court to await instructions. The officer briefly questioned the defendant and then announced that the investigative reply from the Wuchang Court had not yet been received and could not be heard. The hearing was rescheduled for the 23rd. The defendant was still returned to the detention center and visitation was stopped.</p>

<p>Shao Hongmao's Pursuit of Women Results in Tragedy</p>
<p>Shao Hongmao, an 18-year-old from Ningbo, living at No. 38 Shouxing Lane, Fangbang Bridge, works as a salesman at the Lihua Gasoline Refinery in this city. Although Shao's monthly income is limited, he often pursues women and spends extravagantly, making it difficult to maintain economic stability. He often felt panic. Soon after, he privately misappropriated account funds from the factory he was handling. The matter was discovered by the manager, who severely reprimanded him and ordered him to return the funds immediately. Seeing that the matter had been exposed and fearing that it would affect his job, Shao tried desperately to raise the money, but to no avail. Looking back on the past, he suddenly felt resentment. In a moment of impulse, at about 6 PM yesterday, he used a knife to cut off his genitals and testicles in the factory building. He immediately fell to the ground in extreme pain, rolling and wailing. The matter was heard by colleagues, who went in to see what was happening and saw Shao's lower body covered in blood. Knowing that there was an accident, they quickly reported it to the patrol room, which sent an ambulance to fly him to Renji Hospital for treatment. The doctor examined him and gave him emergency treatment, but the injury was too severe and his condition was very critical.</p>

As a result, they also made off with thirty-six dollars in paper money before fleeing with shouts. Afterward, the homeowner reported the incident to the local police station, requesting an investigation and arrest.</p>

<p>To the esteemed editor of Shenbao: In your local news section on the 11th, there was a news item entitled "Postman and Amateur Actor." I have investigated and found that the alleged affair between myself and Fang Juanling was denied in both the First Special District Court and the police station. However, there are verifiable records that contradict the original facts. I am sincerely afraid that the outside world will not understand the truth, which may lead to misunderstandings and have a great impact. Therefore, I am writing to request that this letter be published in your newspaper to make a correction. Thank you very much. Sincerely, Li Yun, January 12.</p>

<h3 id="e229">Zhejiang Education Department Petitions Provincial Government to Quickly Allocate One Million Yuan in Local Bonds to Alleviate Immediate Needs <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>Schools in Various Counties Unable to Maintain Operations and Gradually Closing</p>
<p>Teachers Suffering Greatly, No Different from Disaster Victims</p>
<p>Xu Shaodi, the Director of the Education Department of Zhejiang Province, stated that the province suffered a severe drought last year, causing education in various counties to come to a standstill. He has specially petitioned the provincial government to promptly instruct the Finance Department to allocate one million yuan in local bonds, designated as educational reserve funds. The original petition stated: "The various counties in this province have suffered a severe drought, with crops damaged. The disaster area is almost the entire province. We have successively received official letters from the Provincial Party Headquarters, as well as joint petitions from county governments, local groups, and educational institutions, and reports from the heads of various education bureaus to the province. Education is unable to save itself, and they are all requesting the allocation of provincial funds for relief. It has been found that the educational funds of various counties have been exhausted due to the disaster, causing education to come to a standstill. The previous director requested the allocation of one million yuan in local bonds from this province to serve as educational reserve funds for relief, and requested that the original regulations for the reserve fund be revised to facilitate implementation. This was approved at the 732nd meeting of the Provincial Government Committee, and the regulations were revised and submitted to the Legal Review Committee to organize the clauses. Subsequently, the regulations were reviewed and approved at the 734th meeting of the Government Committee. Now, it has been found that the educational funds of various counties are becoming increasingly tight, and the accumulated arrears are increasing. The counties with the most arrears have reached eight or nine months, and the least have three months. The average arrears have been more than five months. Schools are unable to maintain operations and are gradually closing. The counties with the most closures, such as Jiangshan, have reached 86 schools, accounting for 40% of the county's schools. Dongyang has 85 schools, accounting for 30% of the county's schools. The remaining counties have closures of 50 to 60 schools, 30 to 40 schools, and more than 10 schools, varying in number. The material and spiritual suffering of teachers in various counties is no different from that of disaster victims. If relief is not provided quickly, it will lead to starvation. Various counties have complied with orders to tighten their budgets, which have been reduced again and again, but revenue has not been secured. Demands for salaries and strikes are inevitable. The county government is unable to cope and is in a desperate situation. These are all facts. Therefore, in recent days, this government and various responsible departments have successively received requests from various counties to allocate funds as soon as possible to alleviate immediate needs. This is no different from waiting for aid. Moreover, it is the time for commercial settlement, and it is especially important to complete the settlement before the deadline to avoid being too late. Education is one of the psychological constructions. Maintaining the nearly extinct musical strings is as important and urgent as providing disaster relief. Therefore, we have attached the table of the post-disaster situation of education funds in various counties and respectfully request that you examine and instruct the Finance Department to quickly transfer the one million yuan in local bonds designated as educational reserve funds to this department for distribution in accordance with the regulations. At the same time, please submit it to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek for review and approval."</p>

However, to save expenses, it has been decided that the inspection will not be held this spring. Furthermore, centralized military training will be implemented this summer, and each school should make efforts to prepare. An inspection will also be conducted at that time.</p>

<p>Undiminished Grandeur Despite the Rain</p>
<p>Tongde Medical College has a long history of eighteen years. Its alumni are all over the country, and many graduates have made outstanding contributions to society. Famous doctors in the city include Lu Shifu and Huang Yuexiang, and many others are working in health agencies. Medical affairs in Sichuan and other provinces are almost entirely managed by graduates of the college. Tongde has its proper place in educating talent.</p>

<p>Before January 28th, the college's finances were very difficult. After Dr. Gu Yuqi became president, he balanced income and expenditure and reorganized the content. School affairs and finances were put on the right track. Veterans Wu Zhihui, Executive Director Pan Gongzhan, Pang Jingzhou, and Dean of Academic Affairs Zeng Liqun were all supportive. Director of Discipline Li Dachao also provided assistance. Directors Ben Yue Sheng and Wang Xiaolai also provided assistance from time to time.</p>

<p>Gu tried to purchase a campus site and raise funds for the construction of the campus during a period of turmoil. Therefore, yesterday's (12th) cornerstone laying of the new building was also a time when Gu's efforts were entrusted.</p>
<h3 id="e245">President Ill, Pan Presides <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>

<p>The ceremony was grand. After the Public Security Bureau band played music, Director Pan gave a speech, saying that although the school has been established with a reputation, the lack of school buildings does not meet the requirements of the Ministry of Education. President Gu has done his best to reorganize the school during a time of financial panic, which is admirable. The smallpox manufacturing department of the Health Experiment Institute has moved to a new site and is selling the site to the school at a low price. It is expected to be completed after the spring break. He would like to represent all the directors to thank the municipal government, the mayor, and all parties for their support.</p>

<p>Wu Zhihui</p>
<p>Tongde Medical College's new campus is completed. I will carve a brief history of the college on stone to inform future generations. President Gu Yuqi asked me to write an article. According to the historical records, this college was founded in the seventh year of the Republic of China. Mr. Shen Tanfei proposed it, and the German Medical Association expressed its sympathy and support. It was then established and named the Private Shanghai Tongde Medical College. Mr. Jiang Fengzhi was appointed as the principal, and the school building was rented on Machen Road. The funds were raised, and the equipment was very simple. Scholars came in droves. In the spring of the eighth year, a practicing hospital was attached to Qingdao Road. The inspectors of the Ministry of Education praised it for being able to meet the urgent needs. Donations from all parties gradually increased, and the chemistry practice room and other rooms were gradually completed. More and more scholars came, and famous people from Shanghai were invited to organize the Board of Directors. The foundation of the school was thus solidified. In the autumn of the ninth year, the Board of Directors and the Committee jointly decided to make it coeducational. The number of female students suddenly reached more than ten. By the eleventh year, the total number of students in the school had reached more than one hundred. The school building was repeatedly rented and expanded, and research rooms for bacteria and pathology, and an anatomy room were added. Adult corpses were formally dissected so that students could practically understand the internal organization of the human body. At that time, it was flourishing. In July of the thirteenth year, it was suddenly interrupted due to a small matter. Mr. Huang Zhong was replaced as the principal, Mr. Zheng Bangyan as the hospital director, and Mr. Pang Jingzhou as the director of affairs. They worked together with one heart and endured hardships to maintain the situation. In the fourteenth year, Mr. Huang resigned from the position of principal, and Mr. Pang succeeded him. Because the Board of Directors and the Committee could not be gathered temporarily, Mr. Pang alone shouldered the responsibility of the school and devoted himself to improvement. But the economy was exhausted. Fortunately, Mr. Huang Chuqiu gave generously, and Mr. Pang again paid a large sum of money, so the school was able to stabilize. In the fifteenth year, the articles of association of the Board of Directors were revised, and seven directors were elected to be responsible for supervision and command, and filed with the Ministry of Education. School affairs were becoming more and more prosperous, and students from all over the world, from Korea in the north to Yunnan and Guangdong in the south, praised it as a famous school. Gu, because there were not many classrooms and the wards were narrow, development was hindered. Mr. Pang changed the rented school building to Tongfu Road, and asked acquaintances to borrow tens of thousands of taels of construction fees. With the consent of the owner of the house in the adjacent open space, classrooms and wards were added. It was completed in June of the sixteenth year. In the same year, the Tongde School Journal was also launched. In the seventeenth year, the Minister of Health of the League of Nations, Mr. Lachmann, and the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, Mr. Hu Hongji, visited the school and expressed their deep appreciation. In the twenty-first year, Mr. Pang also resigned from the position of principal due to other matters. At that time, the Shanghai war was in full swing, and the Board of Directors could not be gathered. Therefore, Mr. Gu Yuqi, Mr. Zeng Liqun, etc., organized a committee and appointed Mr. Gu as the chairman to maintain school affairs. The directors were then summoned and resolved to formally appoint Mr. Gu as the president and hospital director. He worked hard and school affairs were progressing day by day. In September of that year, the Board of Directors was approved by the Ministry of Education. It was then seen that the Tongfu Road school building was still insufficient for development. In the winter of the twenty-second year of the Republic of China, a general meeting of all directors was held, and Mr. Shao Lizi was elected as the chairman of the Board of Directors, and Mr. Pan Gongzhan, Pang Jingzhou, and Gu Yuqi were elected as executive directors. Mr. Gu was appointed as the president. The Board of Directors decided to organize a new school building construction committee. Many donors from all parties were willing to help. Mr. Pan Gongzhan served as the executive director and member of the construction committee, and he worked hard with President Gu to plan and organize. Through the introduction of Mr. Cheng Mutun, he was able to purchase the houses and land of the former Health Experiment Institute's smallpox department on Xiangyin Road in the city center, covering an area of more than five acres and eight points. There were twelve large buildings and five large bungalows, but it was still not enough to be deployed. It was decided to add a large auditorium, six classrooms, and thirty-two dormitories. The sanitary and other facilities in each dormitory were well-equipped. Construction began in January of the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China and was completed in three months. This became the beginning of Tongde College having its own school building. All things develop, if you get the right people, you can gradually accumulate into a geometric proportion. Tongde's achievements in fifteen years have been like this. If you add another fifteen years, its grand situation will be ten or a hundred times greater than today, which is certain. Then, the beauty of the building without the best can be guaranteed by this stone. January of the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China, Wu Jingheng of Wujin wrote this.</p>

<p>The B Team's Lineup Was Disorganized, Losing 3-8</p>
<p>The A Team's Talented Players Put on a Wonderful Performance</p>
<p>Jinshun, Colasa, and Baoshali Are the Heroes</p>
<p>The Shanghai Inter-Port Football Team Trial Match was held at Yiyuan at 3:00 PM yesterday. The wind and rain were bitter, and the scene was bleak. There were only three or four thousand spectators. Both teams arrived on time, unlike the perfunctory approach of previous years. However, the field was muddy, making it difficult to run. Although the situation was not very tense, all the players showed their skills, and the performance was wonderful and very satisfactory. In the first half, the situation was even, and the A team led by 2-1. In the second half, the inside forwards of the B team could not coordinate, while the forwards of the A team, such as Baoshali, Colasa, and Sun Jinshun, added to the glory, like tigers with wings. The connection was wonderful, and they made repeated achievements, and the shots were cleverly placed, leaving Shi Meisi at a loss. It was truly a sight to behold. As a result, the A team won a big victory by 8-3. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>A Team Lineup</p>
<p>Wan Xianghua</p>
<p>Li Ning, Maida, Baoshali</p>

<h3 id="e254">The Situation in the First Half, Mutual Respect <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>The lineups of the two teams had already been announced, but Dai Linjing was absent due to injury, and Cash intentionally retired and did not want to participate. It had been predetermined that Feng Yunyou and Colasa would replace them. Zhong Yongshen was temporarily absent due to some reason, and the old man Lux Hart Bacon appeared. Both sides kicked off in the rain and wind, and the situation was quite even. Both sides had opportunities to attack, but they did not succeed. Moreover, because it was a trial match, there was mutual respect and no anger. Therefore, the performance was more clear and beautiful, and the fans were paying attention to each player's performance. The victory or defeat was put behind them. If the official game could be like this, then there would be no unexpected disputes in the football world.</p>
<h3 id="e255">Lao Sun Scores Repeatedly <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>The A team's forwards were very sharp. The B team became a multi-event autumn because the strength of the middle forward line was slightly weak. Sun Jinshun, Colasa, and Baoshali echoed each other, just right, very wonderful. At ten minutes, Sun Jinshun opened the scoring, thanks to the help of Ke Bao. He scored in the left inside forward position. The B team once pursued, and Yichen and Jiaqiu both had shots on goal, but they were either saved or missed. At half an hour, the A team's Fuen sent out a corner kick. The ball was wet and heavy, and the kick was not good. It was headed out by Simmons, but it fell under Sun Jinshun's feet. Lao Sun raised his iron feet and shot into the goal. Smithon dived in and the A team won 2-0.</p>
<h3 id="e256">Returning a Goal <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>After that, Lao Sun had another chance to shoot, but he missed. The B team worked hard, and Colett was very brave. Chen Jiaqiu was well-adjusted, and Hart Bacon sent a high ball. Hewat missed a header, and Colett also headed the ball to attack, but the ball hit the crossbar and fell under the goal, and was caught by Cockran. Li Yichen went deep again, and Lemidi could not catch up. The two chased to the goal, and the goalkeeper rushed out to save the ball. Unexpectedly, A'erjie rushed up and flicked the ball into the goal, and the inside team pulled back a city. Before the center could kick off, the first half was over.</p>
<h3 id="e257">Situation in the Second Half, the A Team Wins Repeatedly <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>In the second half, the performance of the A team was even more wonderful and can be called a spectacle. Therefore, I have to wet my pen and stretch out the paper to describe it in detail to give to the readers. After the kick-off, Chen Jiaqiu made a long shot that was quickly saved. The forwards of the A team fought each other and showed their brilliance. Colasa and Baoshali rushed in and Sun Jinshun followed up. He used a high ball to pick over the defense line. Ma Shan'er did not look at the header, and Baoshali swept in and hit the target. At that time, the situation was entirely the world of the three forwards of the A team. Wan Xianghua repeatedly created opportunities, and Fuen continuously took corner kicks, but unfortunately, he did not succeed. During one of the B team's deep incursions, Hewat committed a handball, but there was no penalty for a twelve-yard shot. In the blink of an eye, Baoshali had rode alone to the B team's goal and shot against the goal post and rebounded into the goal. Smithon was at a loss, and the score became 4-1.</p>
<h3 id="e258">Score of 5-1 <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>After the B team was greatly frustrated, it tried to make progress. Jiaqiu and Yichen tried their best to contact Colett. A'erjie shot angrily on the border, but unfortunately, it did not hit. Baoshali was ambitious and unhindered, and shot another ball, which was beautifully saved by Smithon, winning a lot of praise. General Bao stared at the door, and came back, rushed in like a flying horse, and Chen Hongguang followed him and chased him to the 12-yard place in front of the B team's gate. He shot laterally and hit the goal again, and it became a ratio of five to one. At this point, the B team's lineup was quite sluggish. They wanted to counterattack, but they had more than enough heart but not enough power, and they repeatedly lost opportunities because the shots were not accurate. Once, Li Yichen attacked at the front door six or seven yards away, but he flew into the sky, and the sound of sighing was endless.</p>
<h3 id="e259">Recapturing Two Cities <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>Although the A team was intimidating for a time and won repeatedly, the B team did not show weakness and was even more motivated to fight back. Hart Bacon was old and strong, and the border rose up. He went to the appropriate location and sent it to the center. Colett met the head and shot into the goal. It was very beautiful. Not long after, A'erjie also copied in from the side line and approached the goal. Li Ning rushed up, and the two fell to the ground. Unexpectedly, A'erjie kicked the ball out early, and the ball was very slow and slowly rolled to the goal line. An Zhi's goalkeeper Cockran had also slipped early, and used his hand to catch the ball, but the fingers touched it to no avail, and the ball slowly rolled into the goal line, which can be said to be very funny. The B team unexpectedly pulled back two cities in a row, making it 5-3.</p>

<p>Extreme prosperity turns to adversity, a misfortune arrives unexpectedly. Stoke committed a handball, resulting in a penalty kick. Sun Jinshun took the penalty, striking with great force, but Smeaton miraculously saved it, drawing cheers from all around. Team B was overjoyed. Ke Laituo dribbled the ball, charging into Team A's penalty area. Seeing the situation was unfavorable, Li Ning tripped Ke from behind, managing to avert danger. However, not awarding a penalty kick was truly fortunate. Later, Sun Jinshun made a beautiful shot, which Smeiton also skillfully saved, creating a remarkable spectacle of mutual excellence. In the subsequent five minutes, Team B suffered a streak of bad luck, conceding three goals in quick succession, a truly rare achievement. Bao Shalie received a pass from Ke Lasha and, without turning, back-heeled the ball. Wan Xianghua added a shot, and Ke Lasha fired a long shot that grazed the goalpost and went in. Shortly after, Ke Lasha scored again, completing a hat-trick. Team B's defeat was not Smeaton's fault but rather due to the negligence of the defenders and midfielders. The brilliance of Team A's shooting was unexpected, leaving even the experienced Smeaton helpless.</p>
<h3 id="e261">General Assessment of Skill: Two Goalkeepers <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>Overall, the players on both teams were relatively balanced. Team A excelled in evenness and displayed wonderful coordination, further troubling their opponents with their swift running. Team B, on the other hand, struggled with coordination, their forwards were slow and lacked discipline, their momentum diminishing as they approached the goal, and their shooting was poor. The performance of Bao Shalie, Ke Lasha, and Sun Jinshun was unlike anything ever seen. Team B's biggest weakness lay in their weak center defense. The two inner defenders, Ma Shan'er and Stoke, failed to support each other. Smeaton's goalkeeping should not be judged solely on the outcome; he was truly helpless to prevent the eight goals conceded. Ke Kelun's goalkeeping was no less impressive than Smeaton's, and both performances were highly satisfactory.</p>
<h3 id="e262">Inner and Outer Midfielders <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>Ga Xu expressed reluctance to be selected this year, leading to lament over the difficulty in finding a suitable center-back. Feng Yunyou seems unlikely to be chosen, and Xuemengsi is also not satisfactory. Perhaps they will still have to use Ga Xu. The two midfielders, Leimidi and Maidai, performed exceptionally well yesterday, incomparable to Liang Shutang and Chen Hongguang. Regarding the inner defenders, Li Ning is undoubtedly secure. Stoke is unlikely to be selected. Xiu Tuo and Ma Shan'er each have their strengths, but Xiu Tuo is stronger and more robust, and can also cooperate with Li Ning. Stoke has recently been the center-back for a Western merchant team and is unlikely to be an inner charger. Consequently, he inevitably runs too far out, leaving the interior vulnerable. Ma Shan'er struggled alone to support the team, which is why Team B suffered such a heavy defeat.</p>
<h3 id="e263">Forward Talent <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the forwards, right winger Fu En is far inferior to Zhong Yongsen. Although Zhong did not play yesterday, it is expected that Zhong will be the ideal right winger. Ha Tuo and Pei Gen are merely courageous individuals. On the left wing, Wan Xianghua is undoubtedly superior to A'erjie, but Wan's recent performances have been less impressive. Among the three central forwards, judging from yesterday's performance of Team A's Sun Jinshun, Ke Lasha, and Bao Shalie, there are no better players in Shanghai. Their key strength is their excellent coordination. Achieving such results through a chance combination is truly remarkable. Their excellent shooting is a secondary matter. They are indeed ideal selections. Ke Laituo is far inferior to Ke Lasha. Li Yishen is slow and unable to coordinate with others, and his shooting and other skills are far inferior to Bao Shalie. Chen Jiaqiu is obviously unable to compete for Sun Jinshun's position. Even considering Dai Linjing, he might be better than Ke Lasha, but he definitely cannot achieve the same level of coordination with Sun and Bao as they did yesterday. A final decision can be made after the second trial match.</p>

<p>— Yan Xinquan</p>
<p>What Should Children Be Like?</p>
<p>Little friends! This year has been designated as "Children's Year," and I think you already know that! So, what should children themselves be like during Children's Year? I'll mention the most important things:</p>
<p>(1) Exercise your bodies,</p>
<p>(2) Study diligently,</p>
<p>(3) Buy domestic goods,</p>
<p>(4) Practice the New Life Movement.</p>
<p>I hope that every little friend can achieve the four points listed above. If you can, then not only will your personal future be hopeful, but the future of the country will also be hopeful!</p>
<h3 id="e272">Zhu Wengong's Childhood <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— Dazhai</p>
<p>Zhu Zi, named Xi, posthumously honored as Wengong, was a person of the Song Dynasty. When Wengong was five years old, he read the Classic of Filial Piety and wrote on the book, "Not to be a human if not like this." Because his father was very knowledgeable, he followed his father to study. At the age of fourteen, his father passed away, and he began to study with a teacher according to his father's will. At the age of eighteen, he passed the Jinshi examination. Wengong was interested in learning but had no intention of seeking fame. After completing his term, he resigned from his official position and returned home to study under the renowned teacher Li Tong. Later, he lectured at the Bailudong Academy, established rules for learning, and compiled a complete collection of Neo-Confucianism. Teachers and scholars alike have considered it to be of great value. In addition to lecturing, Wengong also focused on writing. He authored many books, most of which promoted the morality of Confucius and Mencius, such as the Collected Commentaries on the Four Books. Later scholars regarded him as the orthodox interpreter of the classics. His recorded conversations are written in a style similar to modern vernacular Chinese, making them easy to understand. He also wrote Chu Ci Bian Zheng, showing that he did not neglect literary composition. Now, in the main hall of the Confucian Temple, there are twelve tablets of sages, and one of them is him. Although he was a person of the Song Dynasty, far removed from Confucius, his learning was no less than that of Confucius's disciples, so he was specially added to show respect.</p>
<p>Little friends, you should know that the reason why schools have abolished the reading of classics is that classical texts are not easy for young students to understand. However, classical texts have their own value and are not as harmful as floods or ferocious beasts. This is something that must be understood. Vernacular Chinese is valued for its accessibility, but classical Chinese also has its own uses and cannot be completely dismissed. If you read textbooks and say that classical texts have no value, or if you understand some vernacular Chinese and say that classical Chinese has no use, then you are mistaken. Consider that Zhu Wengong aspired to live according to the classics from a young age, and so he ultimately became the orthodox interpreter of the classics, compiled a complete collection of Neo-Confucianism, and was worshiped by later generations. Seeing the great from the small, the success of one's aspirations is truly admirable. Although he advocated the vernacular style, he was also skilled in classical Chinese. If someone had said that classical Chinese was of no use, would he have opposed it in Wengong's time? Would he have still been willing to study it? I am not advocating for the reading of classics, nor am I fond of classical Chinese, but I am telling little friends not to misunderstand, and to learn from Wengong by aspiring to live a life of purpose.</p>
<h3 id="e273">Iron <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Little friends, please think about it, what is one thing in our daily lives that we cannot do without?</p>
<p>Clothing: Clothes are made by machines, so what are the machines made of?</p>
<p>Food: Whether it's plants or animals, plant chlorophyll or animal hemoglobin, they all contain iron.</p>
<p>Housing: What are the steel frames and all the nails and other accessories in our houses made of?</p>
<p>Transportation: Do cars and ships all have iron in them? Iron is so important, how can we not pay attention to it?</p>
<p>Little friends, you think that iron is a black metal. On the contrary, iron is actually white. So what is black? Black is iron rust.</p>
<p>Iron is a white, hard, lustrous, and malleable metal. It rusts easily in moist air, especially in the carbon dioxide exhaled by people.</p>
<p>Iron can be divided into three types: pig iron, wrought iron, and steel:</p>
<p>1. Pig iron: is hard and brittle, so it cannot be hammered into shape and has no malleability or ductility. What is malleability and ductility? Malleability: For example, a piece of pig iron cannot be hammered into a thin sheet. Ductility: For example, a piece of pig iron cannot be drawn into a thread. Therefore, to make utensils from pig iron, you must first make a mold and pour the pig iron into the mold to form a utensil.</p>
<p>2. Wrought iron: is not hard and not brittle, and has malleability and ductility. It can be hammered into shape. Have you ever seen a blacksmith make a knife? He heats a piece of iron red-hot, and then he hammers it, and before long, it becomes a knife. Wrought iron is easier to make utensils from than pig iron.</p>
<p>3. Steel: is very strong and tough. If it contains too many impurities, it can also be brittle and hard. Steel has even greater uses. What about trains? What about ships? What about springs? What doesn't use steel? And steel has a lot of elasticity.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, China has very few iron-smelting factories, so we rely on foreign iron. Little friends! Work hard! In the future, let's open the world's largest iron-smelting plant! Then you can be considered a useful person.</p>

<p>— Dazhai</p>
<p>Getting rid of the old and welcoming the new,</p>
<p>Getting rid of the old and welcoming the new,</p>
<p>Virtue and accomplishments must advance with the years.</p>
<p>As the end of the flowing year passes, the beginning of the year brings new vitality.</p>

<h3 id="e275">Mr. Science Performs Magic <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— He Gongchao</p>
<p>Celebrating Children's Year</p>
<p>Not long after the New Year of the Republic of China in 1935, Mr. Science was on stage again. In his hand, he held a piece of white paper and a new calligraphy brush that had never been used. His assistant also held three small bottles, one with alkaline water, one with vinegar, and one with litmus solution.</p>
<p>As soon as he took the stage, he bowed to the children below and said:</p>
<p>"This year is 'Children's Year,' and I congratulate you all. I hope that starting this year, your bodies will become stronger and stronger, and your knowledge will improve day by day. I hope you will be even more interested in studying scientific knowledge. I hope that in the New Year of 1936, your bodies and knowledge will be much better than they are now. Now, let's perform a magic trick":</p>
<p>He spread the white paper on the table, dipped the new brush in the alkaline water bottle, picked up the brush and wrote the words "Celebrating" on the white paper. After it dried, he dipped some vinegar and continued to write the three words "Children's Year". After a while, these five words completely disappeared, leaving no trace. It still looked like a piece of white paper.</p>
<p>He took out some litmus solution, added a little clear water, and held a mouthful. He called his assistant to pick up the white paper and sprayed the water from his mouth directly onto the paper. Immediately, the blue words "Celebrating" appeared on the white paper, and the red words "Children's Year" appeared.</p>
<h3 id="e276">Celebrating Children's Year <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>How fun! So there was a round of applause from below...</p>
<p>"Do you know why this happens? It turns out that litmus solution turns blue when it comes into contact with alkaline substances, and it turns red when it comes into contact with acidic substances. Alkali is a type of alkaline substance, and vinegar is a type of acidic substance. Therefore, writing words on paper with alkali water and vinegar will reveal red and blue strokes.</p>
<p>"Is your school going to have a fair? Why don't you perform this trick for everyone - you can write a few words or draw a picture.</p>
<p>"Where can you buy alkali and vinegar? You can just ask your mother or sister. Litmus solution can be bought at the scientific instrument store."</p>
<p>Experiment tools: one new brush, one piece of white paper.</p>
<p>Chemicals: alkali, vinegar, litmus solution.</p>
<h3 id="e277">A Cake Made by Over a Thousand People <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Peng</p>
<p>Last Sunday, I went to eat at a relative's house, and during the meal, I heard something very strange, which was "a cake made by over a thousand people."</p>
<p>That relative said to his son, Fuyue, "We will eat cake in a while. This cake was made by over a thousand people." Fuyue showed a surprised look and said, "Father! This cake must be made by over a thousand people, it must be taller than that house!" I also found it very strange. After a while, the cake actually came, but it was not particularly tall. It was a very ordinary fruit cake. Fuyue smiled and said, "Is this it? The cake you just mentioned," the father said, "That's right!" Fuyue continued, "Didn't you say it was made by over a thousand people?" We all ate a piece, and the father said with a smile, "Now, go to your bag and get the slate and slate pencil and help me calculate the workers who made this cake!"</p>
<p>The father said, "To make cake, you must first grind flour. Flour is made from rice, and rice is hulled from grains. The fruits of rice are grains, which farmers grow. Don't you think there are already many people? Plowing requires plows, and plows require blacksmiths and carpenters. Grinding flour requires mills, and mills require stonemasons. Aren't there many more people here? The fruit is transported from afar. There are fruit growers and fruit sellers. Adding them up, there must be many more people. At the same time, steaming the cake requires burning coal. Miners mine the coal, and then people who make iron pots make the pots. And when steaming the cake, you need to use cloth to line the bottom, so there are cotton growers and textile workers and people who make weaving machines. I don't know how many more people need to be added!" When the father said this, his very smart son, Fuyue, said, "Okay, okay, Father, I have already counted over a thousand people." Little friends! Do you believe that this cake really requires over a thousand people to make? We must know that the cake we ate was not easy to come by!</p>
<h3 id="e278">Several Interesting Numbers in the Human Body <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— Chang Su</p>
<p>The human body contains a total of 210 bones, of which the skull bones account for 28, the trunk bones account for 52, and the limb bones account for 130. Children have even more than this number, an increase of nine, because some bones will fuse together in adulthood.</p>
<p>The total length of the large and small intestines is about 25 feet, with the small intestine accounting for four-fifths and the large intestine only about five feet. The teeth of an adult total 32, with incisors (commonly known as front teeth) totaling eight, canines (commonly known as canine teeth) totaling four, premolars totaling eight, and molars totaling twelve. As for children's milk teeth, they are all replaced by the age of seven or eight, totaling 20.</p>
<p>When a man takes a deep breath, the amount of air that enters and exits is about 3,000 cubic centimeters, and during normal breathing, it is about 500 cubic centimeters. The amount of breathing for ordinary women is less than that for men.</p>
<p>The amount of blood pumped out by the heart in a normal state is about two gallons per minute (each gallon equals 3.78 liters), and more than 120 gallons per hour. The speed at which blood flows in the blood vessels is two feet per second, about seven miles per hour, and about 168 miles per day. The heart beats an average of 73 times per minute and about 4,320 times per hour. These numbers are amazing!</p>
<h3 id="e279">Gramophone <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— Huosheng</p>
<p>Little friends, isn't it fun to turn on the gramophone when we are free? But you have to know how hard the person who invented the gramophone worked to achieve today's success!</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the gramophone was also invented by Edison. When he first invented it, it was very incomplete. His workers heard him say that a machine he had prepared could make human voices, and they thought that the old man was deliberately joking with him. No one believed him. Who knew that Edison actually spent ten years of work to make the gramophone, which everyone did not believe in, completely perfect and contribute it to the world. Once, he did not sleep for five days and nights in a row to improve the gramophone, working in one breath!</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that there is no such thing as "gain without effort" in the world!</p>
<h3 id="e280">Children's Science Lecture: The Wonders of Plant Leaves <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Yin</p>
<p>Have you heard your teacher say that plants breathe? You may be skeptical. Only animals have lungs or gills for respiration, so can plants also have lungs or gills? No, plant respiration is due to leaves, the chloroplasts of the leaves. If you don't believe me, we can try an experiment to prove it. Take the leaves of a plant and put them in a glass, and then cover them with a paper cover to prevent the inflow of outside air. After two or three hours, if you put a paper twist lit with fire into the glass, the fire will immediately go out. (Figure 1) This makes it clear that the leaves of the plant absorb the oxygen in the glass, and the glass is full of carbon dioxide, so the fire of the paper twist can no longer burn.</p>
<p>We know that the important nutrients of plants are water. When a plant is about to wither, just water it and it will revive. When there is too much water, it is evaporated by the leaves. The absorption and evaporation of plants is the same as human respiration. Let's take the glass and paper cover that we just used and try the evaporation of the leaves again. Fill the glass with water, make a small hole in the paper cover, and insert a leaf of the plant into the hole in the paper cover, letting the petiole soak in the water. Then take another glass that has been wiped very dry and cover it below (Figure 2). After ten minutes, uncover the glass and look. The glass that was just wiped dry is now moist, as if someone has breathed on it. Do you understand where the moisture in the glass comes from? I think, smart little friends! You will definitely answer that this is the water that the leaves absorbed from below the paper cover and evaporated.</p>
<p>The most wonderful thing about plant leaves is that they can prevent enemies, just like animals have claws and teeth for self-defense. The leaves of cacti that we usually see are like thorns, and the edges of holly leaves are sharp spines (Figure 3). If you touch them with your hand, you will feel pain, so you can avoid being harmed by others. On the other hand, they are responsible for protecting, helping new shoots emerge from the solid ground, like bamboo shoots. Leaves in plants are really like the role of our human limbs. Do you think they are so smart!</p>

<p>— Xin Qing</p>
<p>I remained there, struggling for my life. I clung to that piece of wood for a day and a night, so I didn't sink. I thought I only had a short time to live, but the next day a good wind drove me to the shore of a small island. I was extremely exhausted from lack of food.</p>
<p>The rocks on this coast were very steep. If it weren't for the roots of the trees and other plants that gave me a foothold, I would never have had the chance to climb up and reach a place where the waves couldn't reach.</p>
<p>I ate some herbs that I found and drank some water from a clean and fresh spring. Then I set off to see what I could find.</p>
<p>Not far from where I was, I saw a horse, and I walked over to it. The horse was a fine animal, and I stood there looking at it for a long time.</p>
<p>After a while, I heard a voice, and a man was standing in front of me. He said, "Who are you?"</p>
<p>After I told him my miserable situation, he took me to a cave. I saw many more people there. They gave me food and drink, which I enjoyed very much. They told me that they were servants of King Melechi of the island. I found that this was a good opportunity to go with them to the town, which was some distance away.</p>
<p>If it weren't for these people, I would have died. Without their help, I would not have found my way to the inhabited part of the island, and those servants only came to this place once a year.</p>
<p>The next day we set off for the capital of the island. When we arrived, they took me to see their king. He said, "Who are you? And how did you get here?"</p>
<p>After I told him, he ordered his men to provide me with everything I needed in terms of clothing, food, and money.</p>
<p>The town where I now live is a port on the coast. Ships from all over the world can be seen here.</p>
<p>As the days passed, I spent a lot of time near the sea, because I thought maybe a ship from my hometown would come, or I could hear news of Baghdad, or find a small boat to take me back.</p>
<p>King Melechi has an island called Ganser Island. I once went to this island and saw very large fish there, some of which were over a hundred feet long. I also saw some fish that were less than two feet long, and their heads looked like owls.</p>
<p>One day a large ship came in. As soon as the ship was moored, the sailors began to take all the cargo out of the hold.</p>
<p>I stood aside watching them work, thinking how happy I would be, when I saw several packages with my own name on them. These goods were exactly what I had brought with me when I set out from Basra.</p>
<p>I told the captain that these things were mine. At first, he would not let me take them, saying that Sinbad was dead and that I must be an imposter.</p>
<p>He said, "When people look at you, they always think you are a good and honest person. But I saw Sinbad die. When that big fish swam, it took him straight to the depths of the sea. So how could you be Sinbad? I think everything you say is false."</p>
<p>I said, "If you are willing to listen to me carefully, I think I can prove it to you. I am Sinbad, whom you think you saw sink to the bottom of the sea."</p>
<p>So I told him everything that had happened! How I was thrown ashore by the waves and met the king's servants, who took me to the court.</p>

<h3 id="e282">Domestic Financial and Foreign Exchange Markets Remain Flat; No External Assistance for Speculative Funds <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>Sharp rise followed by a steep fall... Retreats by two yuan</p>
<p>Since the gold market rebounded the previous day, the overseas silver market contracted yesterday. The market opened rather firm, but the exchange rate market failed to tighten in unison. Major players took advantage of the high prices to collectively supply the market, gradually moving downstream. Although the Central Bank repeatedly opened spot bids, which helped to maintain the level, selling pressure ultimately prevailed, and prices fell again. The market started firm in the morning but weakened later in the day, resulting in an overall decline. The general trend was mediocre. It was observed that the overseas silver market fell in both the UK and the US at the beginning of the morning, and forward silver prices also contracted. The exchange rate continued to fall, while the price of London gold rose by five pence. Pre-market trading opened, immediately rising to over 67 yuan. The Central Bank's listed prices were announced, with the pound unchanged and the US dollar contracting by 0.0625. The customs gold unit rose by six li, and the standard price of speculative funds rose to 998 yuan and two jiao. Fuxing Yong and other firms entered the market, pushing prices up to over eight yuan. The market opened high in the morning. After the opening, buying sentiment remained strong, and short sellers also made covering purchases, keeping the market firm. Prices once approached the 70 yuan mark, but banks poured in supply at the high prices, and major players followed suit, selling off and causing prices to fall. Although there were buyers after the decline, the domestic market remained flat, hindering the rise of the gold market, which fluctuated without a clear direction. The announcement of the silver equalization tax showed no change, remaining at 6%. The pound exchange rate, calculated at one shilling five pence and six two five, also had little impact. Although there was a slight decline, buying sentiment remained strong. The Central Bank opened spot bids at 962 yuan, which facilitated a rebound after the decline. Trading volume in the market was limited, and the overall trend was extremely mediocre. Unexpectedly, selling pressure remained latent, and suppliers converged at the end, leading to a sharp decline due to a lack of support. It was observed that the trend in the morning was relatively stable, with little major change in the number of chips, estimated at about 25,000. The Central Bank had opened spot bids at a price of 962 yuan, and spot transactions for February delivery were once concluded at four yuan and a half, with the seller paying the difference. The market situation for the morning is recorded below. The market opened in the morning at 968 yuan and one jiao, up two yuan and four jiao from the previous close. Fuxing Yong, Heng Yu Heng Xing Yuan, Yongfeng Da Fa Yong, etc., entered the market up to nine yuan and three jiao. Heng Yu Da Fa Yong continued to enter up to nine yuan and a half, but the price stagnated due to Zhengjin releasing US dollars for January at 75, and Dadecheng Fuxing Yong selling contracts. Later, Dadecheng, Qian Changxiang, Fuxing Yong, Heng Yu, Yuanchang, Heng Chang, Yongfu, Yu Shunmao jointly unloaded, falling to five yuan and two jiao. Heng Yu Dingkang and retail investors took advantage of the low prices to acquire contracts, rising to six yuan. Dadecheng Hengxing sold out and had more positions. Sassoon had placed an order for shillings. Tianfeng Yong Heng Yu Dadecheng came to sell, gradually lowering the price. The silver equalization tax was announced, remaining unchanged, and the price once retreated to five yuan. Heng Chang Yong aggressively entered at the low prices, rising to six yuan and three jiao. Tianfeng Yong, Dadecheng, Ding Chang, Tianfeng Chang Da, etc., disposed of their holdings, causing the price to fall to four yuan and three jiao. The Central Bank opened 210 spot contracts at a price of 962 yuan, and Yuanmao Yong Rui Kang and others entered the market, boosting morale. HSBC also acquired shillings for March at 6875, rebounding to six yuan and six jiao. Shunmao Fuyu tried hard to sell contracts, and Mitsui again placed an order for US dollars for February at 3125, falling to five yuan and two jiao. Citibank took US dollars for January at 8125. Zhaofeng Chang Heng Yu entered up to six yuan and one jiao. Shunmao came to sell again, causing widespread disappointment, and retreated to five yuan and two jiao. At this time, the situation was extremely mediocre. When the Central Bank opened spot bids again, Yingfeng Heng Fuxing Yong came to enter, pushing the price up to six yuan and seven jiao. After the entry, Korea and other firms aggressively sold foreign exchange, and the domestic market hardened again. Dadecheng Dada Yuanmao Yong Dafayong Hengxing and others competed to sell, falling to three yuan and three jiao. The market closed at noon at 963 yuan and seven jiao. After the close, Dada Yuanmao Yong sold slightly and weakened, but ultimately remained stable. The highest price during the morning was 969 yuan and a half, and the lowest price was 963 yuan and three jiao, a fluctuation of six yuan and two jiao. The result was a decline of two yuan from the previous close.</p>
<p>The settlement price, based on the Central Bank's standard price of 998 yuan and two jiao for speculative funds, was about 34 yuan lower according to the closing price, about five yuan higher than the previous close. The recorded price for February was 964 yuan, the replenishment price in the morning was 950 yuan, the price of pure gold was 973 yuan and one jiao, and the spot market remained stable. Tianjin firms sold 700 taels to Yingfeng Heng in the market at a premium of eight yuan and two jiao and a half. Fuchang once paid Yingfeng Heng 70 contracts for spot February delivery at four yuan and a half, because the Central Bank's term bid was four yuan lower, the first spot bid. The Central Bank opened bids for about 420 spot contracts, with Dadecheng Yingfeng Heng and others selling at a price of 962 yuan, generally about four yuan weaker than the term bid.</p>
<p>The market trading sought a balance between supply and demand. In summary, Shunmao Dadecheng Yuanmao Yong Wanxing Hengxing Yong Deren Fada Yong Ding Chang Tianfeng Yong Yuanchang Yong Dada Tianfeng Qian Changxiang and others were on the selling side, while Dafayong Juchang Dachangxiang Heng Yu Yongfeng Qingfayong Futai Hengyifeng Yong Yingfeng Heng Ruikang Jinlong Hengxingyuan and others were on the buying side. Fuxing Yong Dafayong Hengxingyuan Yuancang Yong advanced and exited later, Fuyu Qian Changxiang Zhaofeng Chang exited first and entered later. Dalian firms Wanxing traded a total of about 400, netting out over 100 contracts. Shunli traded a total of less than 200, netting out over 100. Guangdong firms Shengda had little trading, Hengxing entered a small number and exited about 200. The total number of transactions on the day was only 27,734 contracts. The market will be closed on Saturdays in the future.</p>
<p>The lineup for February delivery includes 4,100+ contracts long for Zhengchang, 2,200+ for Fuchang, 1,700+ for Fuyu, 1,400+ each for Fuxing Yong and Dingkang, 1,100+ each for Juchang Senchang Yong and Shunmao, 1,000+ for Heng Yu, 900+ for Qingfayong, 800+ for Zhaofeng Chang, and over 700 each for Chunyuan Yong Dachangxiang Changsheng Yong and Jinlong, over 400 each for Hanh Heng Dafeng and Heng, and over 300 each for Tianfeng Heng Xingyuan Bingxing Yiyu Hongxing and Hengtai, and over 200 each for Yuansheng Yong Changda. The short positions include 5,600+ contracts for Qian Changxiang, 2,400+ for Dadecheng, 1,700+ for Yu Qingyong, less than 1,500 for Yuanmao Yong, 1,100+ for Ruixing, 1,000+ for Yongfeng, 900+ for Shengda, over 700 each for Tongfeng Heng Yuanyi, over 600 each for Tongtai Changyuanda Yong, over 400 each for Shunli Yongde, and over 300 each for Yuanchang Yongyisheng Yongheng Dafeng Hengyicheng Yingfeng Heng Fuxing, and over 200 each for Yingxiang Huixiang Xianghe Daxingyong Tianfengyong Runchang Yutong Chunyuan Kangxiang Futai Heng Fucsheng Yong. The total number of chips is 25,795 contracts, with a total of 50 long positions and 62 short positions.</p>
<h3 id="e283">The Exchange Rate Market Eases Slightly as Japanese Banks Dump Holdings <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>According to foreign news agencies, the London market saw a decline of 125 for both near and far term contracts yesterday. US banks decreased by 25, and forward silver prices for Montevideo decreased by anywhere from 1.5 to 3.5 percent. Gold in London rose by five pence, while the British Pound versus the US Dollar decreased by 375, and the US Dollar versus the British Pound fell by one cent. The British Pound versus the French Franc remained unchanged, and the US Dollar versus the French Franc fell by 1.875 percent. The exchange rate market in the morning opened at a recent selling price of one shilling five pence for the British Pound and 34 yuan and 75 fen for the US Dollar, which accounts for the fall in the exchange rate with the British Pound loosening by 0.03125 and the US Dollar tightening by 0.0625 compared to the previous close. The Central Bank announced the listed prices, and the British Pound remained unchanged while the US Dollar decreased by 0.0625. The customs gold unit rose by six li. Although the psychological outlook of Chinese businessmen was good, the capacity to buy was limited, and the banks sought to sell their holdings, making it difficult for the market to tighten. Banks conducted transactions with each other, owing to the increased purchasing capacity of Chinese businessmen, loosening the forward British Pound exchange rate. The Shanghai Banking Corporation announced the listed prices, and the British Pound remained unchanged while the US Dollar decreased by 0.0625, which had very little impact. The announcement of the silver equalization tax was held steady, while the British Pound was calculated at one shilling five pence and six two five, which also lacked any special stimulus. The banks' buy and sell orders were inconsistent, and it was generally stable. The Central Bank repeatedly opened spot bids, providing a lot of support, but the underlying trend was still loose. The noon exchange rate for near-term sales was one shilling five pence or 0625 on average for the British Pound, and 34 yuan and 875 for the US Dollar. The British Pound and US Dollar each loosened by 0.0625 compared to the previous close. Chinese businessmen were watching from the sidelines, and the offsetting was average. Banks transacted with each other, Sassoon put in a spot order for shillings, and the Japanese trading community had a lot of selling sentiment. The most aggressive seller was Korea. The transaction prices for the half-day are recorded below:</p>
<p>The British Pound opened in the morning at a recent selling price of one shilling five pence for the British Pound, and Anda sold it to McGarry for four pence and six eight seven five for March. Shanghai Banking Corporation sold a spot order at five pence to the Western trading community, and Sassoon sold an equal amount to East Asia for January. Korea sold it to McGarry for four pence and five six two five for April, and sold it to Shanghai Banking Corporation for six eight seven five for March. Korea sold it to Hua Bi for eight one two five for February. Korea sold it to Anda for a spot order at five pence and 0625, and Mitsui sold an equal amount to Anda for the same month at the same price. The selling price at noon was one shilling five pence and 0625 for January, four pence and seven five for February, six two five for March, and five six two five for April, and a half pence for May. The purchasing price was 0625 plus.</p>
<p>The US Dollar opened in the morning at a recent selling price of 34 yuan and 75 fen. Zhengjin put in an order for January at 75, and Mitsui put in an order for the same month at 6875, but withdrew 34 yuan for March. British (Bank) Mitsui put in an order for three one two five for February, and Citibank withdrew eight one two five for January. Korea put in an order for the same month at the same price, but withdrew three seven five for February. Korea sold it to Chase Manhattan for a spot order at 875. The selling price at noon was 34 yuan and 875 for January, three seven five for February, one two five for March, thirty-three yuan and nine three seven five for April, and eight one two five for May. The purchasing price was 0625 plus.</p>
<h3 id="e284">The Interbank Call Loan Market Stabilizes <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>No matter how much water is added, the "hua tou" (illegal premium) is still white.</p>
<p>The silver dollar market is now gradually stabilizing. The interbank call loan rate yesterday was still two jiao and three fen, the same as the day before, but the use of "hua tou jia shui" (illegal premium added to the commission) to prop up the loose and excessive commission has been changed to a pure white marking, which fully shows that people are tired and lazy, and the market atmosphere is far less urgent than last month. The transaction of call loan bills was over 1.8 million in the morning and over 300,000 in new transactions. The market saw transactions of over 400,000 at noon, the Shanghai Small Bills Association saw transactions of over 400,000, the silver pawn market saw redemption of over 500,000 and new transactions of over 800,000, the banknote market saw the withdrawal of over 500,000 and the issuance of over 700,000, and the secret mark coupons saw 500,000. Remittances from various sources were over 500,000, cash withdrawals were over 300,000, customer source was 200,000, and outflows were 250,000. The banks' collection and settlement, foreign banks' collection and settlement of essential funds were over 1.9 million, telegraphic transfer funds were over 400,000, and various goods and miscellaneous funds collected and settled were over 3.0 million, foreign exchange settlement was over 500,000, special remittances were over 300,000, and 400,000 was delivered from the warehouse. Chinese banks' collection and settlement of bill funds were over 2.2 million, various goods and miscellaneous taxes were over 3.6 million, foreign exchange settlement was over 600,000, special remittances were over 500,000, and 300,000 was delivered into the warehouse.

In addition, the total number of exchanges at the Shanghai Joint Reserve Committee Note Exchange on the 12th of this month was 8,237,874.80 silver yuan, including 3,775,206.56 silver yuan and 4,462,668.24 silver yuan in remittances. The public bond short-term interest rate was 0.12 yuan per thousand yuan, and the public bond discount rate was 0.23 yuan per thousand yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan small coins were 847 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets, a slight decrease of 0.5 yuan from the previous day. In terms of trading volume, there were no transactions in either the morning or afternoon markets. Guangdong small foreign coins were 759 yuan in the morning market and changed to 759.5 yuan in the afternoon market, the result being the same as the previous day. The trading volume was 180,000 jiao in the morning and 65,000 jiao in the afternoon. There were no changes in copper coins, remaining at 307,000 wen, with a trading volume of 33,770 strings of wen, equivalent to 11,000 foreign coins in price.</p>
<h3 id="e286">Minor Fluctuations in the Securities and Bond Market <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>Only swap transactions cater to the market</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market at the Chinese Securities Exchange became more sluggish, with extremely minor fluctuations and increasingly thin trading. The brokers were idle and mostly took a wait-and-see approach, showing signs of declining interest. The interbank call loan rate remained unchanged at two jiao and three fen, and the short-term premium was only five fen. Apart from some swap transactions, there was little interest in new buying and selling, and the trend remained weak. The bulls seemed to be slowly exiting the market, but this was not expected to cause a major drop in prices. It was anticipated that the market would continue to fluctuate around the same level until the end of the year, as most of the customer brokers had closed their books and only a few were looking for opportunities to swap or settle their positions. Therefore, it was not yet possible to break free from the fluctuating state. The market trend throughout yesterday was extremely dull, with almost no ups and downs. Prices generally fell slightly in each session, with some sessions seeing high prices followed by low prices and others seeing low prices followed by high prices. The bulls were indeed exiting the market, but they were not actively selling. Swap transactions were also conducted opportunistically, with a complete wait-and-see approach. Therefore, the overall market price at the end of the day showed a slight decline of 0.05 to 0.2 yuan, with only troop reduction forward contracts and 20-volume near-term and small triangular contracts seeing the most activity. The total trading volume was only 6,071,000 yuan. A comparative list of the resulting gains and losses is provided below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>

<p>Xin Feng Foreign Firm reports that the New York stock market suffered a disastrous decline yesterday (the 11th). Speculators, fearing that the Supreme Court would uphold the gold clause, sold off stocks and commodities and purchased bonds with gold clause provisions. Traders bought US dollars in the foreign exchange market, causing the US dollar to rise. US government bonds, which had been sluggish since August of last year, suddenly saw lively trading yesterday as traders sold off bonds without gold clause provisions and exchanged them for those with gold clause provisions. Railway companies with large gold clause debts saw particularly sharp declines in their stocks and bonds. Brokers reported that there are currently a large number of orders to sell at limit prices, indicating that speculators are deeply concerned that the Supreme Court's decision will be unfavorable to the government. The stock market's decline was quite severe, and Chicago wheat also fell due to the uncertain outcome of the gold clause, triggering a large-scale sell-off. The total trading volume for the day was 1.38 million shares. The Dow Jones indices are listed below.</p>

<h3 id="e288">Yarn and Cotton Markets Show Weakening <a href="#e288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>Bulls and bears seem to be looking for a change after a period of stagnation</p>
<p>The yarn market, which has been fluctuating for a long time, is now showing a slightly weaker trend due to the continued decline in foreign cotton and the sluggish sales of spot yarn. The major bulls have no intention of taking delivery this month, and Japanese firms continue to engage in swap transactions. The bulls and bears in the market seem to be looking for a change after a period of stagnation, so the trading volume is higher than in the past few days. The market price may see changes of one or two yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e289">Golden Rooster Continues to Fall by 35 Fen <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>The pre-market opening for Marked Yarn was weak due to a further drop of over ten pounds of American cotton, and the news that Tongcheng Company had no intention of taking delivery this month further softened sentiment. As a result, near-term prices fell by 2.3.4 fen, and far-term prices fell by 1 fen. In the afternoon, it was reported that spot yarn transactions were slow, and it was found that only over 200 bales were transacted throughout the day, further softening sentiment. However, new sellers were not active, and prices fell slightly by 1.2.3 fen in each month. Another message was that Japanese firms dumped over 1,000 bales. It was found that Dafeng sold 1,300 bales, Dafu 250 bales, Changfeng 350 bales, Runkang 350 bales, Xinhua 350 bales, Deji 700 bales, and Tongji 600 bales.

<p>The cotton market is showing a slight weakening trend due to the continued decline in American cotton and the rumor that yarn factories will stop work early. Factory demand is becoming more sluggish, and sentiment is particularly weak. Most are watching for lower prices, but the situation for Indian cotton is still high. The chips for delivery this month are currently not very enthusiastic, so the market price has not fallen greatly.</p>

<p>Before the cotton picking season, the market opened weak because Indian cotton fine lint still fell by 0.75 rupees, while coarse lint cotton rose by 1.75 rupees. However, the bulls in the market remained inactive. Although the market sentiment was虚慌 (unsure meaning, perhaps "weak"), market prices did not fall significantly because Chong'an purchased over 4,000 dan. As a result, prices for each month rose by 5 fen. The market opened flat in the afternoon, but by the second and third sessions, the situation showed a lack of vitality. Yuan Da aggressively increased its short selling position. Indian cotton White Lok district fell by 4.5 rupees in the after-hours market, leading to some floating profits being taken, and the trading floor eased slightly. Prices for each month then fell by 0.15 to 0.105 yuan. It was found that Changfeng sold 5,700 dan, Jinchang 1,100 dan, Yuan Da 1,200 dan, Yi Chang 1,100 dan, Run Kang 1,700 dan, Yuan Xing 2,100 dan, Yi Feng 1,400 dan, and Chang He 2,400 dan. Da Fu bought 1,800 dan, He Xing 1,600 dan, Tong Xing 1,000 dan, Chong'an 4,200 dan, Geng Feng 2,300 dan, and Yuan Xing Chang 900 dan.

<p>Yesterday's US cotton market saw foreign merchants selling, and ordinary bulls taking profits. January futures saw bulls turning to selling due to delivery notices for 900 bales, and buyers reluctantly offloaded their positions. Weakness in notification orders, the wheat market, and the stock market, as well as discrepancies in the gold market, caused prices for each month to gradually decline after opening with gains or losses of 1 to 3 points. Demand was sluggish, and firms bought on dips. At closing, prices rebounded slightly due to some short covering. Spot prices fell by 10 points, and futures prices fell by 11 to 15 points. English cotton was stable, with spot prices rising by 2 points and futures prices falling by 1 point. Indian cotton was flat and weak due to cross-selling by Japanese merchants and hedging by cotton farmers. Pingguoer rose by 1.75 rupees, Aomula fell by 1.25 rupees, and Bairoxi fell by 0.75 rupees.

<p>A New York telegram dated January 11 reports on the cotton market situation for the week: The cotton market situation this week is still stable. After the bullish trend began, the South sold slightly more, while the bearish trend was curbed by purchases from foreign and domestic firms. Speculators are awaiting new developments in Washington, especially paying attention to the limits of the Bankhead Act and the government's policy of releasing cotton bonds in 1935, so interest is currently not strong. General commerce is becoming more optimistic, but buyers are unwilling to store more cotton, as the number of sales from the South is not small, and at current prices, it is enough to satisfy current demand. The price difference between cotton in New York and Liverpool is increasing, and the claim that foreign cotton that can compete with US cotton has a more firm market price is becoming more credible. Thus, when prices here fall slightly, merchants related to foreign countries continue to purchase. The Department of Agriculture estimates that the world production of various types of cotton in 1934 was 26 million bales, each weighing 478 pounds, a decrease of 3.1 million bales compared to the previous year. The cotton cloth market situation this week is calm and firm.</p>
<h3 id="e298">Grain Imported Wheat Continues to be Booked, Flour Market Sees Selling Activity <a href="#e298" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c298" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">298</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw a uniform weakness in all months after the opening in the morning. The prices for imported wheat in Chicago fell by about 5-7 cents, and in Canada by about 1-2 cents. When the prices were opened, the sharp drop in imported wheat prices caused the people inside and outside the industry to see a soft market. As the settlement period was approaching, trading in the local and foreign ports gradually concluded, so asking prices fell by about 1 fen. When the market opened in the afternoon, trading in all months was brisk. About 310,000 bags were traded in half a day. Because the factory booked a ship of Argentine wheat at a price of 4.875 yuan, the market saw brisk selling, and the market continued to fall. According to industry observers, the market should not be too weak as domestic consumption can continue. However, after the continued booking of imported wheat and the increase in capital, it may be difficult to see a strong recovery. As a result, the current month fell by 0.2 fen, February fell by 0.175 fen, March fell by 0.225 fen, April and May fell by 0.2 fen, and June fell by 0.275 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e299">Wheat Market Had Some Short Covering <a href="#e299" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c299" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">299</a></h3>
<p>Forward contracts showed a loosening trend</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market was generally flat after the opening in the morning. The prices for imported wheat in Chicago fell by about 5-7 cents, and in Canada by about 1-2 cents. Trading in the current month was very light when prices were opened, and market sentiment was calm. Although forward contracts were affected by the small price of imported wheat, selling was not smooth, and prices hovered. When the market opened in the afternoon, prices were slightly firmer in the current month due to slight short covering. In the forward months, market sentiment was slightly weaker due to news of continued bookings of imported wheat. As a result, the current month was up by 0.3 fen, March was down by 0.2 fen, and there was no change in the rest. The spot wheat market was still good, and arrivals were not abundant, so prices remained stable. Shandong Guidemai opened at 4.034 yuan, Yaowanmai at 4.01 yuan, and Xinpumai at 4.02 yuan, totaling 8,000 bags, which was handled by Fuxin.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat and Corn were weak and the external markets were low, leading to the exposure of limit-down sell orders.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various gangs were obstructed by heavy fog, and then turned scarce again. Only the 20th arrived (a total of more than 4,000 shi). Market sentiment was restored by the cloudy and rainy weather, and the late rice also had Qingdao gangs continuing to handle 400-500 bags, so the market rebounded by several fen. Early rice also saw a slight improvement. Only the price of Su Tong japonica rice remained stable as supply and demand were balanced. Due to the lack of goods and smooth sales, Du Jian saw a prominent increase. Foreign glutinous rice continued to be out of the market, while Yinbianyuan's path was not broad, and the market was uniquely weak.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the arrivals at the wharf were around the 20th. Due to the continued rain, the sales of various types were sluggish, and the market shape has been declining recently. Due to high costs, customers were unwilling to release their positions. The market price of white japonica special goods stood firm. High-grade prices fell by 0.1-0.2 yuan. Other than Bo Dao Xiaojiao, Bian Yuan Xiaojin Jiao, and the remaining goods barely stood firm.</p>

<p>Customer Xian arrivals and inventories are low</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market continued the bearish trend of the previous day, and the market and market sentiment declined again. No one asked about futures, new transactions stopped, and sales inquiries continued. However, importers were watching, and the whole market only opened Saigon rice for immediate shipment of 200 tons, with the price only at 4.62 yuan, and the market shape was still not stable. Spot foreign rice was very active in the mainland yesterday, with 3,100 bags going to the mainland, all of which were secondary machine rice and broken rice. 1,200 bags of machine rice went to this street, and prices were generally 0.1-0.15 yuan lower than the previous market. Customer Xian was very active in this street yesterday due to the high production price and low arrivals and inventories. The market seemed to have stabilized. Yesterday, a total of 2,500 bags of Xiang rice and 430 bags of Shashi brown rice were opened. In addition to 400 bags of machine yuan going to Tianjin and 750 bags of broken brown rice going to the mainland, all were taken in by this street.</p>

<p>Recently, the sales of soybean cake have continued, so the market price has fallen and rebounded. Yesterday, the Shantou gang began to purchase spot soybean cake for forward delivery. It is estimated that the delivery price for February for four-brand cake is 1.44 yuan. Changde Factory sold 5,000 pieces, Da You Factory 10,000 pieces, Sui Feng Factory 10,000 pieces, and Da De Xin Factory 15,000 pieces. The market sentiment is tight, and the Dalian telegram continued to rise, so the market is temporarily viewed as stable. The market situation for yellow soybeans is that the sales of Hankou goods are slow, and they are still weak. The sales of Guidemai soybean factory on the Longhai Railway are still connected, and the bottom accumulation is not thick, so the market remains stable.</p>

<p>The wheat bran market has been silent for days, because foreign banks have been unmoved for nearly a month. On the mainland side, sales have turned sluggish due to the settlement of accounts and tight credit. Market sentiment is uniformly weak, and each stall's asking price opens at 2.66 yuan, or even 2.65 yuan. After this, if imported wheat remains quiet, or due to credit relations, it will present a fixed situation.</p>

<p>Prices have turned around</p>
<p>Recently, Hunan lotus seeds have gradually seen increased sales in Hangzhou, Shaoxing, and other places, and the market trend has been slightly rebounding. The purchase price in Hankou is also very stable, with higher prices at 28 yuan, followed by 26 yuan. Market prices in the production area are relatively flat, and the Shanghai market is slightly higher than before. Top Xiangtan lotus seeds are selling for 33 yuan, and the rest are reduced accordingly. White lotus seeds are in short supply, and the current market price is 42 yuan, which is extremely firm.</p>

However, overseas order trading flourished, so 2,000 boxes of American tinplate were ordered yesterday, each box at 4.4 gold yuan, up 5 fen, made by Yongxing Foreign Firm. 500 bundles of 24-28 gauge plain sheet iron were also made, with the price pulled to 13 pounds, down 2 shillings and 6 pence from before. Tinplate tiles of 24-28 gauge were also made, and it was heard that 600 bundles were traded, with the price at 12.5 pounds per ton. In addition, it was heard that new foreign silver dollars such as brass were also made, but the market has not changed.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of the year, Bai Tong oil has seen Hankou deliver goods to foreign firms for days, mostly forward oil sold previously. As the source is not prosperous, all arrivals are used to offset futures, so current deliveries are very scarce, and foreign firms have few transactions. The price is still 31 yuan per dan, and they do not dare to sell too much because there is no delivery. Foreign firms have had a good appetite recently, but firms want to increase the price, intending to be 32 yuan, and it is okay to throw some, but foreign firms are unwilling to do much, so there are no transactions. Firms have been opening deliveries to customers for days, estimating Xiangtong to be 26 yuan plus change, Tianjin goods to be 25.7-25.8 yuan, and Nanzhi to be around 25 yuan, all according to customer rules, totaling 1,600-1,700 dan. Considering the scarcity of the source, it is feared that the market will be difficult to hope for. Most of the Zhejiang Tung oil produced this year is insufficient, also due to age, so those that can meet the standards and be delivered to foreign banks generally require more than 26 yuan per stone, and insufficient goods are around 25.2-25.4 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e327">Meng Jiangnu's Reincarnation <a href="#e327" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c327" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">327</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Shen</p>
<p>Whether Meng Jiangnu actually existed in history is still a question, but the fact that Qin Shi Huang built the Great Wall is probably reliable. Qin Shi Huang forced people into corvée labor, and the people sacrificed under his tyranny were far more than just Meng Jiangnu's husband (assuming she existed). The number of widows created by this tyranny was far more than just Meng Jiangnu. At that time, needless to say, many tragedies occurred, so why is it that only Meng Jiangnu became famous? This is a bit strange. We can see from Meng Jiangnu's ballads that she is mainly celebrated as a chaste woman, and it can even be said that she is famous for her good crying; originally, such a person was not worthy of "immortality," but for thousands of years, people have been singing her name. Therefore, we have the right to have such doubts; the so-called Meng Jiangnu is a character shaped by later rulers according to their own models. Because the legendary Meng Jiangnu does not contain any danger to the ruling class, on the contrary, she is an ideal figure that suits the tastes of the rulers. Instead, she was praised by feudal society.</p>
<p>But now Meng Jiangnu has actually been reincarnated! The "Jinan Express" tells us that a "Jinan Meng Jiangnu" has come to Jinan (in fact, she came from Shaanxi, so she should be called Shaanxi Meng Jiangnu, but the Jinan reporter insisted on recognizing her as a fellow villager and taking it as an honor!) Han Guiqing, "traveled thousands of miles to find her husband, determined not to give up." The reporter only "recorded the outline of her deeds on the left," which is tens of thousands of words! The tone is full of praise. Allow me to drop a sentence, "This is not accidental." The conditions for producing this kind of Meng Jiangnu are being prepared again. With the rise of feudal consciousness, Meng Jiangnu's reincarnation is really not a strange thing.</p>
<p>Now let us get to know this "Jinan Meng Jiangnu"! Her fiancé, Sun Defu, to whom she "traveled thousands of miles" to join, was forced by the wealthy gentleman Li Baoqing to become a beggar in Jinan. And now the arrogance of wealthy gentlemen and landlords is a common and frequent phenomenon. As a rule, a woman who is praised by reporters in newspapers should be a warrior who bravely fights against wealthy gentlemen, landlords, and the system that produces wealthy gentlemen, but what about our "Jinan Meng Jiangnu"? The reason she became "Jinan Meng Jiangnu" is only because she firmly embraced the determination that a married woman should not eat from two families and went to join her fiancé, Sun Defu, "who was not a free love match but an old-fashioned marriage, so they were still strangers when they met"! If she and Sun Defu really had love and knew each other deeply, her actions would still be a brave warrior who passively refused to cooperate with feudal forces. But even this point is not mentioned!</p>
<h3 id="e328">"Being Laughed at by Feudal Remnants" What Harm! <a href="#e328" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c328" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">328</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Yi</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Yu Dafu's "Where Should Chinese Women Run"</p>
<p>Last year's great drought saw the emergence of many women's publications; this year, we can expect favorable weather, and such publications will be like bamboo shoots after a rain. On the first day of the new year, the Women's Ten-Day Profit, which had been suspended for a long time, was revived. The lead article in the content is Yu Dafu's famous article "Where Should Chinese Women Run." Here are a few excerpts:</p>
<p>"Looking at the current situation in China, it seems impossible to completely abandon the family. And women's occupations are not very numerous. Moreover, even male university graduates are sighing about the difficulty of finding employment here, let alone ordinary women."</p>
<p>"My meaning,... may be a bit too old,... unmarried adult women should leave the family; married women should still take care of the family first,... Moreover, China's feudal system has not been completely overthrown: if the housewife of a small family (married women in large families are an exception) runs out regardless of the family, causing the man to suffer the burden of raising children and managing the family, wouldn't she be laughed at by feudal remnants?"</p>
<p>According to Mr. Yu's high opinion, women should generally not run away from the family. After men no longer sigh about "the difficulty of finding employment," there are two types of women who seem to be able to engage in occupations, namely:</p>
<p>(1) Unmarried adult women.</p>
<p>(2) Married women in large families.</p>
<p>And there is one type of woman who he believes should absolutely not engage in occupations, namely:</p>
<p>Housewives of small families.</p>
<p>I want to try to block this high opinion with a mantis arm. Please ask:</p>
<p>(1) In the process of social evolution, should women step into society from the family?</p>
<p>(2) According to the current situation, will there be a day when men's "difficulty in finding employment" is resolved? Can women wait until then to look for occupations!</p>
<p>(3) Large families exist in feudal society. In order for women to have occupations, is it necessary to restore the large family system?</p>
<p>(4) What has become of the people who are afraid of being laughed at by feudal remnants?</p>
<p>(5) Apart from a few people, how many peaceful families are there now that women can be asked to manage?</p>
<p>I dare to answer: for social evolution, women must join society together with men; for women to return to the family is an obstacle to evolution. Chinese society can only have a glimmer of hope if men and women work together to struggle; if feudal poisons are used to confine women, men's "difficulty in finding employment" will probably never be resolved in the current society. As for the large family system, it has become a zombie with the feudal system. If women want to enter that realm, there is no need to talk about occupations. Married women who want to find occupations are mostly those from small families with no relatives to rely on or those with independent personalities. Not letting such people take up occupations is either cutting off their livelihood or destroying their aspirations, which ultimately burdens society.</p>
<p>Moreover, how many peaceful families are there in the current society? Gentlemen just tell women to return to the family, it would be simpler and clearer for beggars to return to the living room. Since the family no longer shelters from wind and sun, and women are not given proper occupations, they can only wander the streets; what is there to talk about regarding morals, order, and safety?</p>
<p>Men always want to maintain their dignity of being served in the family, this is called feudal remnants! Because of these remnants, many women have abandoned their social tasks, and many women have even sadly fallen into the abyss!</p>
<p>Feudal remnants have become something that is not worth mentioning. From the perspective of mutual assistance between men and women, within the possible scope, men in small families should take on some of the work of managing the family. Being laughed at by feudal remnants, may I ask Mr. Yu, who has a reputation, what harm is there?</p>
<h3 id="e329">Talking About Japanese Women's Magazines <a href="#e329" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c329" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">329</a></h3>
<p>— Nan Ru</p>
<p>Japan is indeed a country with a relatively high level of culture. Despite the years of economic downturn, various magazines are flourishing like bamboo shoots after a rain. There are also many women's magazines, at least seven or eight times more than in China. "Fujin Koron (Women's Public Opinion)," "Shufu no Tomo (Housewife's Friend)," "Fujinkai (Women's World)," "Fujin no Tomo (Woman's Friend)," "Fujin Gahō (Women's Pictorial)," "Fujin Club (Women's Club)," "Shōjo Club (Girls' Club)" are the most famous monthly magazines, but their content is almost entirely the same: catering to the women of the bourgeoisie. For example, "Shufu no Tomo" and "Fujin Club" are simply the only reading materials for cultivating virtuous mothers and good wives. The text inside is either about how women should obey and be considerate of their husbands, or how to raise children, entertain guests, manage housework, and be a gentle and capable housewife. The majority of readers of these publications are naturally wives, but there are also many unmarried girls who buy them to prepare for being wives. Needless to say, their thinking absolutely advocates men governing the outside and women governing the inside. They see themselves as their husband's wife and their children's mother. Their task is to serve and obey their husband, and bear and raise sons. They don't need other social knowledge, so the content of the publications becomes domestic.</p>
<p>The nature of "Fujin Koron" is somewhat similar to "Chūō Kōron (Central Public Opinion)." Sometimes Yuriko Miyamoto also writes something here, saying a few provocative words in order to awaken a relatively conscious group of women, but the effect is minimal, because the entire publication is based on this doctrine of good wives and wise mothers. Even if you shout until your throat is hoarse, only a few people will hear you.</p>
<p>In a position opposed to the above publications are "Fujin Geijutsu (Women's Literature and Art)," "Josei Bunka (Women's Culture)," and "Kagayaki (Radiance)" published by the Women's Art Society.</p>
<p>These three are all monthly women's cultural magazines. However, "Kagayaki" is very small in size, only half the size of a newspaper, but the text on it is short, concise, and full of social practicality. The editor is Shigure Hasegawa, who is as famous as Kan Kikuchi. Progressive writers such as Yuriko Miyamoto, Ichiko Kamichika, Yasuko Hirabayashi, and Ineko Kubokawa also often contribute articles. This publication was called "Women's Art" three years ago, a thick volume with rich content. I once read three issues. Due to some reason, it has been discontinued for a long time, but according to Hasegawa, it is always possible to resume publication in January or February next year.</p>
<p>"Fujin Geijutsu" is considered the only progressive women's reading material. The editor is Ichiko Kamichika, a famous progressive writer. Since its publication in July last year, it has been published every month in a thick volume without interruption. The content includes literary theory, literary criticism and introduction, creative novels and poems, Q&amp;A, research, etc., focusing on the theory and creation of lower-class women's liberation.</p>
<p>This publication is the only magazine in Japan where progressive female writers can express their opinions, so the content is very rich and the readers are particularly numerous. When it was first published, there were some economic difficulties, but now, because the number of subscribers and buyers is increasing day by day, this problem is no longer a problem. Ichiko Kamichika said: "This publication belongs to Tokyo, to the oppressed women of the world. No matter how bad the environment is, we must continue to struggle. And we hope that international female writers will work with us!"</p>
<p>December 25, 1934, in Tokyo.</p>
<p>For women, can we only be equal to decorations? I ask.</p>
<h3 id="e330">Women's Occupationalists with Double Price <a href="#e330" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c330" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">330</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Yi</p>
<p>Selling one's labor to others, and exchanging wages or salaries from others to support oneself, is called an occupation. So, in the current society, engaging in occupational activities, under the condition of being employed, no matter what kind of occupation one is engaged in, one always has to pay a price, which is generally labor.</p>
<p>Selling a portion of labor and obtaining an occupation to make a living is a common phenomenon, but in history, it was very difficult for women to obtain this opportunity. Therefore, in thousands of years of human history, women were raised by men. Although they had labor, there was nowhere to exchange it for an occupation. This is the result of women being oppressed and not getting liberation. In modern times, women can sell their labor and engage in occupations in society. General historians and social problem researchers call this phenomenon one of the facts of women's liberation, which is indeed correct. Because women thereby obtain economic independence and the opportunity to participate in social economic undertakings, changing from people of the family to people of society.</p>
<p>However, modern women occupationalists, especially Chinese women's occupations, although they can gradually engage in occupational activities in society, there are some occupations in which women cannot be like men, only needing to pay the single price of labor to obtain them. They often have to pay a double price than men, that is, in addition to paying labor, they also have to pay a physical appearance price. Therefore, I call this occupation a double-priced occupationalist.</p>
<p>For this type of double-priced occupation, let's temporarily leave aside the female staff in institutions, because although some people say that they are only used as "vases" and rarely pay labor, they are still relatively high-level people, so we are not convenient to say that. There is also another type, which is the female receptionists and singers in various entertainment venues. Although they pay labor under the condition of entertaining guests and singing, they also have to pay a physical appearance price in order to continue in that occupation. However, we will also leave these women aside, because although they are forced to engage in that occupation because of life, the general view of society considers that occupation to be relatively low-class, and it is not good to count it as an example of a proper occupation.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that various companies and stores are magnificent and dignified great business organizations, and are one of the economic lifelines and centers of all cities. The people who serve there, although not very high or very low, can at least be regarded as moderate, proper, and free occupationalists. Therefore, the female staff serving there are called legitimate and justified employees, and no one can say this or that about them. However, in reality, the female shop assistants in these stores are still very pitiful. Obtaining that kind of occupation cannot be the same as men, only paying the price of one kind of labor is enough. They also have to pay a physical appearance price in addition to paying labor, in addition to their main duties of being busy all day, taking goods, writing accounts, and calculating accounts, which is regardless of whether they are willing or not.</p>
<p>When we go to those companies, all the female shop assistants have at least average or above appearance, they all apply powder and rouge, and are deliberately charming. Is it possible that in such a large Shanghai, there are no women with below average appearance? Why are there not a single one in those stores? Is it possible that their income is all very rich? Why can they all dress up like rich wives? It is very obvious that companies and stores originally want to use them as signs. Those who are not young, not beautiful, and not good at dressing up cannot attract employers and do not have the magic of attracting business, so they are naturally in the elimination list. In this way, those women with insufficient appearance, and those who are unwilling to desperately decorate and follow the trend, cannot obtain that kind of occupation. Therefore, not only do those female shop assistants have to treat customers with a humble attitude, but they also welcome all frivolous customers to flock to them, so that the company's business is considerable. This is determined by the improper social psychology of the company, the female shop assistants, and the customers in all aspects, and there is no way to deal with it. However, this psychology and phenomenon fully express the male-centered social thought of treating women as playthings. How can women obtain the same occupation as men? How can they obtain thorough liberation!</p>
<h3 id="e331">A Glimpse of Women's Out-of-School Relief Center <a href="#e331" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c331" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">331</a></h3>
<p>— Qian</p>
<p>Out of curiosity and the desire for knowledge, I ran to several women's supplementary schools in a row, but the impression they gave me can be said to be too vague and too clear.</p>
<p>First of all, let's talk about a certain women's supplementary school that has been in Shanghai for two or three years, has a thriving number of students, and recently set up a branch school. On a cloudy and cold day, I walked into the reception room of a certain school's main store. It was a very elegant three-story Western-style building. At the top of the reception room, a large Western piano was squatting majestically. A middle-aged woman in a leather coat was opening the piano with a key. On the right wall of the guest room was a long chair of the kind used in a waiting room, and a young girl was embroidering on the chair; on the left wall were two glass bookcases. In addition to a few dictionaries, "Ciyuan (Etymological Dictionary)," and books such as "Children's World," there were "Liangyou Pictorial," "Times Pictorial," "China Pictorial," and "Movie Pictorial." So many cover beauties filled the bookcase, as if a beauty contest was being held there first.</p>
<p>Because I had to wait for my friend to finish class, I had to stay in the reception room as much as possible, and the playing that hadn't even recognized the staff was drilling into my ears. But during this time, I became familiar with the statistical table on the wall. According to the table, the students' occupations were: merchants accounting for 60%, military and government accounting for 20%, medical and other fields accounting for 15%, and workers accounting for 5%. I thought that it should also be proved here that the above occupation statistics are not the students' own occupations, but 95% are the occupations of their parents or guardians. As for the subjects, there are Chinese, English, arithmetic, embroidery, sewing, music, and bookkeeping. Just as my eyes reached the student's place of origin statistics table, a carriage driver carrying a wool blanket suddenly came in from outside. After a while, a fashionable and wealthy-looking woman walked out from the inside. After she greeted the middle-aged woman playing the piano, the piano-playing woman locked the piano and went to the carriage with her arm in arm. Soon, a bell rang, and my friend also appeared in the guest room, so I went upstairs with her to their dormitory.</p>
<p>The six beds in the dormitory were all arranged in a row against the wall. Not far from the door, there was a long wooden washbasin table, with countless washbasins placed on it. In the center of the room, there were three tables in a row, which were desks for students to study and practice writing. These three desks were ridiculous: one was a small table more than a foot wide and two feet five inches long without drawers. The tabletop was black and white, even uglier than the table in someone's kitchen where the cupboard was placed; the other one was the same size as the first one, but it could be regarded as a small desk in terms of appearance and practice. On this desk, a lady with carefully permed hair was studying hard; as for the third desk, only God knew. A square table with drawers, the style was still the authentic Chinese product from twenty or thirty years ago, the paint was almost completely peeled off, and the color of the exposed wood had turned into a unique brownish-yellow due to years of wiping. These three antiques are where the six resident students in the dormitory prepare their lessons day and night. As for the light above, there was only one dim 25-candlepower electric light.</p>
<p>Speaking of fees, the school's prospectus and my friend's actual situation are as follows: 10 yuan is charged for each subject, and resident students pay an additional 8 yuan per month for accommodation and 8 yuan for meals. In terms of correcting homework, there is a diary every day in Chinese class, but for some reason, the Chinese teacher was replaced three times in less than two months. For those who are just learning to write compositions, the teacher does not revise the sentences for them, but only corrects typos, and some typos are repeatedly allowed to be used by those poor old college students.</p>
<p>Because I was dissatisfied with the first visit, the next day, I set off for another women's supplementary school that had risen suddenly. On this day, I went to class with another girlfriend. Because it was getting late, as soon as my friend walked into the school, she led me to the church upstairs. Along the way, we passed a classroom. The door of the classroom was half open, and I saw two women sitting inside, probably students, and another one pacing on the ground, probably the teacher. They were all wearing silk and fur, like ladies waiting for a wedding feast.</p>
<p>Looking up, I had already arrived at the reception hall downstairs. In the reception hall, which also served as a piano room and reading room, a girl of twenty-seven or eight with a fox stole around her neck was doing the work of just recognizing the staff again. Looking at her anxiousness to speed up and her fingering like playing the organ, I really wanted to persuade her to abandon that kind of decoration and learn some other useful knowledge, oh! Unfortunately, I don't know her!</p>
<p>Here, because another group of people have classes here at night, the books and newspapers on display are very progressive. Just as I was engrossed in reading an article, a female clerk walked out of the office. She stared at me up and down for several minutes before turning around and returning to the office. So, like looking in a mirror, I hurriedly took my eyes back and looked at myself. I thought I was dressed very neatly, but at this time, under the polishing of other mountains, I realized that I looked like an ugly duckling. Not only was a coat old, but the material and style were too outdated. A pair of broken leather shoes was simply like a tattered shoe. On the way home, I thought of those poor women who had dropped out of school who didn't even have old coats and broken leather shoes to wear. Learn.</p>
<h3 id="e332">Autobiography of a "Social Person" <a href="#e332" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c332" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">332</a></h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Two weeks of private tutoring life</p>
<p>Several encounters of looking for a job</p>
<p>Recognition of a real "social person"</p>
<p>How I transformed into a social person, after gathering all kinds of oppression from social customs, parental surveillance, and the imprisonment of husbands and children, and how I fought to complete it, that's all in the past.</p>
<p>The most interesting thing was in the summer of 1930, when the wave of unemployment swept me from Anhui to Shanghai. At that time, I was really ridiculously poor. I was eating by boarding with friends, and I found a place to live near my friends. The four walls were all concrete, because it was not a garret, but a bathroom without a bathtub. A canvas bed and three boxes were arranged in a bright and compact way, but unfortunately, there were no tables and chairs, which aroused the suspicion of the second landlord, who often sent me out with probing eyes and welcomed me back with careless eyes.</p>
<p>I read the self-introduction column of Shen Bao with the greatest attention every day, but after two weeks, I still couldn't find a job suitable for me. Sometimes, I would sit at the home of my father's friend. The gorgeous sofa and hypocritical hospitality made me feel very strange. When I saw those poor insects waiting for jobs behind the hall, a kind of embarrassing and helpless expression made my heart clench. I returned with my disappointed heart, wandering the streets again.</p>
<p>The heat gradually subsided, and cicadas chirped on the treetops. One afternoon, this friend of my father came to me. He said:</p>
<p>"Go and teach the three children of Military Commander ×. Although the salary is only 60 yuan, you only teach history, geography, and arithmetic for three hours a day. Chinese and English are taught by male teachers. However, Military Commander × wants the female teacher to be able to live in his house, so that she can take care of the children at any time. - I think, there is nothing you can't do, right?"</p>
<p>Of course, I had to agree. Military Commander × was also a friend of my father.</p>
<p>The life of this family was very extravagant and dissolute. The old man was a retired military commander, lying in bed smoking opium every day; the housework was managed by his wife; there were two or three young concubines to relieve boredom; there were slaves at home, and cars with bodyguards when going out. They had plenty of foreign money, and anything he wanted could be satisfied.</p>
<p>But for me, this was simply a living hell. Although teaching only took three hours, the spoiled children were so incompetent; and outside of class, I had to chat with the wife and play cards with the concubines, endlessly consuming my time, often until the late and tired night; I couldn't read a book at all, or do anything of my own.</p>
<p>I really hated myself: "Is my entire time only worth 60 yuan? "Playing with things loses one's ambition." Why did I bother to leave home? Go away, this is definitely not the place for me to solve the problem of eating!"</p>
<p>So, after only two weeks, I couldn't stay any longer, and I resolutely walked out of this deep den of sin.</p>
<p>Returning to the real garret, I regained my true form and lived very soberly again. One day, I found an advertisement in the newspaper for a music company to recruit staff. The qualifications for the staff were to have basic knowledge of music theory and to have taught music before. I thought I was very confident in this; I immediately wrote a letter of application, even though the salary was only 30 yuan.</p>
<p>A reply came three days later. Following this reply, I walked into a large ballroom, where thirty or forty young women, dressed in gorgeous clothes, were sitting. I looked intently and saw that there was only one, just one, as honest as we were, matching our coarse cloth clothes; I took a deep breath: "What are we here to do? Will she and I have hope?"</p>
<p>The exam was very simple: a young man with very shiny hair and a powdered face sat by the organ, playing harmonies, and asked about the organization of the sound by name. I paid attention to hearing each person's answer. Everyone had mistakes, but the degree of mistakes was different; but to my surprise, that honest fellow didn't make any mistakes at all.</p>
<p>Walking out, my heart was very relaxed, and I felt very sure that since they were recruiting six people, she and I would definitely be secure. However, a week passed, two weeks, three weeks passed, and forever, I never received a reply from that music company again.</p>
<p>At the same time, I was preparing to apply for a silk weaving factory. This disappointment and injustice were forgotten in my rush to run around with my 20 yuan deposit.</p>
<p>Thanks to the mutual care and support of friends, I actually took the 20 yuan and mixed into another group of starving people.</p>
<p>We were called one by one in front of the gentleman and the foreman, and their eyes shone straight at the body of each person being called, from head to toe, and then carefully examined their hands.</p>
<p>"You've read books, right?..." they asked me, and seemed to be discussing with each other.</p>
<p>"Unreliable, troublemaker!..." another pot-bellied man with fierce eyes said.</p>
<p>Like this, I was waved out the door.</p>
<p>I thought: "The company thinks I'm not pretty; but here they think my hands are a little delicate, "unreliable, troublemaker"; - in the current society, what is the meaning of women's existence!"</p>
<p>Now, although I am economically independent, sex and occupation are absolutely free, and I am personally a liberated social person; but eating is for living, and living is not for eating. As a social person, how can I live my social life without being satisfied with personal liberation and losing the social meaning of my life - this is the content of my real life.</p>
<p>Society is not a women's society. For a social woman, slandering women with the "old morality" that binds women has almost become a universal phenomenon. For me, this is discarded beside me like a pile of garbage; it seems that these obvious things have not fooled me. The most terrible thing is the new deception of new-style life; warmth and tranquility make women unconsciously lose the courage to face the hardships of reality; and in the praise of "great lovers," how many women sacrifice themselves; and how many women are tossed about in the famine of occupations, ignoring their surroundings, not recognizing the structure of the real society, so that they deviate from the development of themselves and society and become prisoners of occupation - I, of course, am no exception. After entering society, these traps are laid out on my future. They look like a lush green grassland, but as long as you hesitate, you will fall into an invisible trap; climbing out of one trap after another constantly requires your own struggle and your own fight.</p>
<p>In this stage of life, the old society scolds me as a traitor, and friends in the new society (?) regard me as a fickle and unreliable woman; in all the eyes cast on me, I can feel a kind of mocking and insulting spark. I always believe that the greatness of survivors is great social undertakings. Only in this kind of undertaking can there be one's own existence, and can the brilliance of the relationship between people be discovered. At that time - I thank these evaluations and attacks that promote me to use careful attention to understand and analyze myself and society; the truth rescued me: "Oppressed women, must recognize the direction to go from the essence of social phenomena, and the causal laws of social phenomena, recognize the truth to liberate our entire self! Fight ruthlessly against all new and old bad environments!"</p>
<p>This inner cleansing was indeed a big change for me. The unprincipled disputes growing in my heart, the atmosphere of depression and misery in life, I have converted to this understanding of truth and have obtained clear liberation; I, with a truly individual, conscious life, now and in the future, provide a bright illumination to guide me; a flower of unwavering joy is always blooming in my heart.</p>
<p>On the other hand, unemployment and hunger still follow me like a shadow, which is precisely a huge persecution suffered by general social women! Occupations are so difficult to obtain, and occupational wages are particularly lower than those of men; especially, women's occupations - such as clerks, shop assistants, etc. - are decorated with a sexual insulting nature, which is so infuriating!</p>
<p>However, this is not a matter of emotional indignation. Precisely because women now are still rarely people of society; they are slaves of the family, of husbands or lovers, of children, of private property and occupation; therefore, women who step into society suffer all kinds of persecution and abuse. For our own sake, for the future of our women, we must break through these barriers! Socially meaningful, human labor, resistance, fighting, until we stand in society like men. - In this way, women create their own, the real meaning of social people!</p>

<h3 id="e333">Chinese Woodblock Prints of the Past Year <a href="#e333" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c333" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">333</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Ye</p>
<p>In this turbulent society, those nude beauty paintings and the like can no longer give us any comfort. What we demand is a new art with strong stimulation. Chinese woodblock art has developed rapidly under this condition. Now I will describe the development in the past year in detail below - because of the lack of reference materials, or some places are not described very well. 1. Research Associations. In Shanghai, we must first mention the MK Woodcut Research Association. The association was established on New Year's Day in 1933. There were more than a dozen members, all of whom were very active young people in the woodcut art movement. They produced a lot of results after only one year of effort. Although their achievements - the content of the works is not very satisfactory, they have indeed gained a lot in terms of skills. Unfortunately, the association did not develop well later. Not long after, the Weiming Woodcut Research Society followed MK. Initially, there were only four members, but later it developed to more than a dozen. In this way, a total of five woodcut collections were published by the end of the year. The output of its works is very amazing, but in terms of quality, it is not as good as MK. However, in any case, the enthusiasm of young people engaged in the woodcut art movement is increasing day by day. In Guangzhou, there is the Modern Woodcut Research Society. The society was organized in the spring of last year. There are more than a dozen members. It has held two or three exhibitions and published a woodcut collection in less than a year, which has won good reviews from the public. In Peiping, there was also an organization of research associations the year before last. I think they are still continuing their efforts now.</p>
<p>2. Exhibitions. As far as I know, there was only one exhibition in Shanghai - the third exhibition of the MK Woodcut Research Association. Guangzhou has had three exhibitions. The third MK wood exhibition had about one hundred works. In terms of skills, it is more advanced than any previous wood exhibition. For example, the skills of Chen Kebai, Yefu, Chen Baozhen, Luo Qingzhen, Chen Fuzhi and others have been quite mature. Unfortunately, there is no new development in the expression methods and the choice of themes. In particular, they have not grasped the core of the era well. For example, the fact that imperialism is attacking us fiercely has not attracted the attention of our writers, because it is almost impossible to find a work with anti-imperialist sentiment in the entire work, which has to be said to be a great regret. I have not seen the wood exhibition of the Modern Woodcut Research Society. Although some people say that it has received good reviews from the society, I don't think it will be more advanced than that of Shanghai. It can be clearly seen from Li Hua's "Rest of the Hoeing Workers", "Harvest" and "Abandoned Woman", "Egyptian Costume" and other works. I think these works can quite represent the works of Guangzhou. They also pay great attention to skills like the authors in Shanghai, so they have been studying for less than a year, and some skills are already very impressive. They are very free in choosing themes, but this freedom has exceeded a certain limit; for example, themes like "Egyptian Costume" are meaningless. There is also a serious problem, that is, the authors do not have a definite worldview. For example, Li Hua's "Rest of the Hoeing Workers" shows that a hoeing worker is so tired from work that he does not even have the opportunity to sit down for a while, and can only rest on the hoe handle. Doesn't this clearly show how hard our authors are trying to shout for the masses? However, when we look at his "Harvest", it is different. Our author is not concerned about the total collapse of the rural economy in the country and the poor situation of the peasants struggling in the environment of hunger and cold, but instead obliterates the facts to depict the picture of the peasants' abundant harvest. Isn't this a clear expression of the author's inner contradictions? In Peiping, I heard that several authors initiated a national woodcut exhibition in November, and prepared to hold a mobile exhibition in Peiping, Tianjin, Nanjing, Shanghai and other places in January this year. Although we have not seen their works yet, their efforts can be imagined.</p>
<p>3. Publications. In the past year, there have been as many as five or six woodcut collections alone. The Weiming Woodcut Research Society has published four or five books, such as Weiming Woodcut Collection, Liu Xianxinbo Woodcut Collection, etc. The Modern Woodcut Society has also published one book. The content of Liu Xian's woodcut paintings is very empty, and the skills are not mature. Landscapes, animals, etc. account for the majority. He is so busy publishing collections, we can see how impatient the author is in the study of woodcuts. But his efforts are worthy of our admiration. According to the author, it is a hand-printed original, and the first edition printed 150 copies, which took a lot of energy and time to succeed. The Weiming Woodcut Collection is a collection of better works by more than a dozen members of the Weiming Woodcut Research Society. The content is more substantial than Liu Xian's woodcut paintings, and the skills are better. I think the other woodcut books are about the same. These are just products in the process of studying skills, and we don't need to describe them in detail. However, we warmly hope that our authors will go deep into the lowest level of society to collect the materials we need in production in addition to the study of skills in the future. In addition, there are also many woodcut paintings scattered in magazines and newspapers. For example, Luo Qingzhen's works are the most in "Literature". Some of his works strongly express distorted consciousness, such as "Han River Boatman", "Three Peasant Women", etc. can be clearly seen. Like the peasant women and boatmen on the screen, the author did not take them as the central theme, but only as embellishments of the scenery, making a rural landscape painting more colorful. Isn't this kind of work a pastime after tea and dinner? No matter how skilled the technique is, it is always irrelevant to us. Zhang Wang's landscape paintings are better than Luo Qingzhen's in terms of skills. It can also be seen how hard our authors are working on the production of landscape paintings. Unfortunately, people who are struggling desperately in a life of hunger and cold cannot spare the leisure to appreciate it - it is inevitable that they will fail the author's enthusiasm. In addition, publications such as "Literary Comics" and "Taibai" are also enthusiastically introducing woodcut art. The achievements of those works are mostly limited to the skill aspect. Our authors should also put in a lot of hard work in terms of content. The "Ah Q Continuous Paintings" in the "Drama Journal" of "China Daily" may have attracted the attention of many people. The entire painting has only eleven pictures. I think it is not enough to express such a complicated story as "The True Story of Ah Q" with only one painting. If we move these eleven things to people who have not read The True Story of Ah Q, then he will definitely feel inexplicable. So it can only be used as an illustration for the article, and it is not successful as an independent continuous painting.</p>
<p>4. Summary. The facts have shown how rapid the development of Chinese woodcut art has been in the past year. However, this development is very scattered and unsystematic. In the future, we should step up our efforts so that it can embark on a certain track to develop. Only in this way will the future of the Chinese woodcut movement be promising!</p>
<h3 id="e334">Chinese Education in the Past Year <a href="#e334" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c334" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">334</a></h3>
<p>— Ge Shixiong</p>
<p>The education cause is a constant activity with no end and no full score. In the past year, there are several points about Chinese education that are worth writing about: Regarding ordinary education: one is the advocacy of production education and labor education, the second is the rise of the call for the reform of the education system, the third is the connection between the national rejuvenation movement and education, and the fourth is the efforts of people from all walks of life for popular education; regarding higher education: one is the increasingly serious problem of "graduation means unemployment", and the second is the fragility of university education reflected by the ban on dancing. The details are described below:</p>
<p>(1) Advocacy of Production Education and Labor Education</p>
<p>Since our country advocated running schools in the late Qing Dynasty, due to the errors in the education policy, it is still a consistent scholar-official education. Students who enter school to study become a special class without living skills. The more people who read books, the fewer producers. For decades, the effect of education has not only failed to help the country embark on the road of production and education, but has also gradually reduced the number of productive elements. Recently, in view of the failure of this kind of bookworm education, there has been the advocacy of "production education" and "labor education" that "uses both hands and brains". According to the reports in various newspapers on July 28, the content is: schools in various places should formulate education policies separately by administrative organs and education organs according to the needs of the local area and the personality and family conditions of the students, and the principle of paying attention to education production should be the principle, and the implementation methods are instructed as follows: (1) Each school must set up a school garden, supervise the students to cultivate by themselves, practice various crops on the spot, and may set up agricultural farms or forest and animal husbandry farms according to the organization of the cooperative, and teachers and students will lead the students to plant and raise livestock, and strictly implement the semi-work and semi-study doctrine. All income, except for expenses and payment for the purchase or lease of land prices, teachers and students are entitled to distribute benefits to encourage them. (2) Each school must set up a specimen room to lead students to collect local natural products or artificial products for display and observation. (3) Add knowledge of various cooperatives to the civic education class, add local products and methods to be improved to the geography class, add various knowledge of agriculture, forestry, sericulture, chicken raising, pig raising, and beekeeping to the natural science class, improve skills, and add methods to improve local industries and manufacture products for sale to the physics and chemistry and manual labor classes to promote them. (4) Advocate diligence and thrift, and cultivate the atmosphere of enduring hardship and not using school servants. (5) Each place must run at least one vocational school according to local needs, so that schools become factories and students become apprentices, and occupations become socialized. It can be said that production education has concrete methods in addition to theoretical advocacy. In December, the Ministry of Education held a national labor achievement exhibition, and the products displayed in various places have indeed exceeded the scope of "handicraft" and "craft". In addition, the National Vocational Education Conference also made many resolutions to assist the implementation of production education, only depending on how it is implemented.</p>
<p>(2) The Call for Reform of the Education System</p>
<p>China's education system has never had its own主張, sometimes imitating Japan, sometimes imitating the United States, sometimes imitating England and France, blind people and blind horses, with nowhere to go. After the Republic of China in 1928, it gradually got on track, and primary and secondary schools have made rapid progress, but it still cannot meet the needs of the country. Therefore, Jiang Menglin, president of Peking University, and Hu Shi, Wu Junsheng, Weng Wenhao, Tao Menghe, Xu Bingchang, Zhou Binglin and others proposed to use experimental methods to revise the education system. The shortcomings of the current education system they found are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The current primary and secondary school system overemphasizes the aspect of entering higher education, but in fact, the majority of students cannot enter higher education. (3) The current education system cannot take into account both urban and rural areas, making them develop together. In recent years, rural areas have gone bankrupt and the foundation of the country has been shaken, so we must first seek rural construction, and education must first cultivate knowledgeable farmers. (3) Our country's education system and curriculum often copy foreign countries, which are not in line with the national conditions and the special needs of our country. (4) The basic knowledge training of secondary education cannot meet the needs of universities.</p>
<p>After Jiang and others' reform plan was put forward, educators across the country paid great attention to it, believing that it was the beginning and awakening of the reform of the education system, but it is still impossible to say whether this strategy is the only panacea for treating the morbid state of our country's education.</p>
<p>(3) The Connection Between the National Rejuvenation Movement and Education</p>
<p>The death of nationalists and the bankruptcy of rural areas year after year have made the vitality of our nation faltering, and the national rejuvenation movement has been sung into the clouds. In the past, King Goujian of Yue spent ten years gathering and ten years teaching, and finally destroyed Wu. Therefore, in addition to striving for military national defense construction, he has also attached the same importance to spiritual national defense construction. What is spiritual national defense construction? It is national rejuvenation education. Mr. Zheng Tonghe published an article "On National Native Education" in "Jiangsu Education", which is the most acute 주장. In primary schools, the infusion of local teaching materials, national salvation teaching materials, and the importance of civic training in various subjects in the past year, the national rejuvenation movement has been closely linked with education in the subtle influence, which cannot but be said to be a characteristic of education in this year.</p>
<p>(4) The Efforts of People from All Walks of Life for Popular Education</p>
<p>The number of illiterate people in our country is the highest in the world. The level of national intelligence is most closely related to the strength of the country, so the danger of the Chinese nation is not without reason. The call for popular education and improving national intelligence has long been sung into the clouds, but the national treasury is empty, and the education funds have no room for generous planning. Beyond the possible limit, there is no way to expand. In mid-September last year, Ma Xiangbo, Tao Zhixing and others initiated the organization of the China Popular Education Assistance Association. There are two points worth noting about the association: (1) The purpose of the association is to adopt the most economical, fastest, most sustainable, and most progressive methods to strive for the popularization of education needed by the public and children to improve their lives to assist in the creation of the Republic of China and the Datong world. (2) The educational purpose of the association is to develop basic education for the people, to help everyone learn to read and understand, to implement the near elimination of illiteracy, to enhance the ability of production and self-reliance, to improve the lives of the people, and to inspire national consciousness in order to achieve the purpose of self-sufficiency, self-defense, love for the community, and love for the country.</p>
<p>The most important work is the equipment of education vehicles and the plan of mobile schools. Education vehicles are being piloted in the experimental area of the large field and the rural areas near the Zhao Jia Garden Flower Village experimental area in Zhabei, and the results are very good. Each car is staffed by two "little teachers" as teachers. Mobile schools are work-study in nature and have not yet been seen in all matters.</p>
<p>(5) The Increasingly Serious Problem of "Graduation Means Unemployment"</p>
<p>In July of this year, the Beiping University Graduates' Career Movement Alliance suddenly appeared in newspapers. University students are outstanding members of society. At a time when China's construction cause is just beginning and there is an urgent need for talents, it is heard that "graduation means unemployment", which is indeed a complicated and serious problem. Tan Shuzai of the alliance said at a reception for reporters: "... The reason why we have this organization is to promote the improvement of political education and the solution of career problems." The alliance's declaration also said: "For thirty years, the government and people from all walks of life have only known to set up schools and create talents, but no one has asked about how to arrange statistics. Some even regard education as a business, regard students as commodities, and indiscriminately manufacture them, regardless of sales, resulting in more people than positions, and the study is not used. What is used is not what is learned... There are countless people who die in the window. Those who are good at drilling and relying on power and profit can get promoted and gain power... To this day, it has become a society full of unemployment... In a word, it is the career problem, and the influence of bad education." It can be said that he speaks with emotion. After the start of this movement, first Beijing and Hankou responded, and then representatives were sent to Beijing to petition, and the situation became increasingly serious. The comments on this matter in the field of discussion are different. In all fairness, the occurrence of this movement should not be blamed solely on educators. The defects of the political and socio-economic system are the background for its production. However, those who run or preside over university education should be aware of the current crisis of education and have something to change it.</p>
<p>(6) The Fragility of University Education Reflected by the Ban on Dancing</p>
<p>The ban on university students dancing in Shanghai's education sector followed the occupational movement alliance. "Dancing" itself cannot be regarded as an evil, but university students are accustomed to the pleasures of sensual entertainment, obsessed with forgetting to return, and putting the pursuit of academics and the discipline of life behind them, which is enough to make university education fundamentally bankrupt. However, whether banning dancing can drive students into the study room, and whether banning dancing can prevent students from being superstitious in other sensual pleasures, we cannot help but be deeply suspicious of this.</p>
<p>The ban on dancing in various universities in Shanghai is precisely a reflection of the unfulfillingness of current university life, the lack of active training, and the thin atmosphere of academic research. Therefore, banning dancing is not a fundamental solution, and banning dancing may not have good results. If the hosts of the university do not start from improving the facilities, enriching the curriculum, and making the idle spirit of university students get proper catharsis, I have not seen the palliative measure of banning dancing.</p>
<p>In summary, Chinese education in the past year can be said to be advancing steadily in the process of awakening, repentance, and transformation from any aspect. Perhaps shortcomings can be found everywhere, but the consistent attitude of people in the education sector to seek good is always admirable. The old year has passed, and the author finally wishes the workers in the education cause to create a new page in the history of education in the new year!</p>
<h3 id="e335">The Chinese Book Industry Over the Past Year <a href="#e335" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c335" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">335</a></h3>
<p>— By Kang Nai-de</p>
<p>The fireball of recession continues to roll through the market, incinerating the prosperity of various industries and businesses. The book industry, while also a cultural endeavor, cannot escape the misfortune befalling general industries and businesses. The phenomenon of recession was even more pronounced in the Chinese book industry in 1934.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, the buyers of books are generally intellectuals, especially young students. However, in recent years, due to the decline of industry and commerce and the bankruptcy of the rural economy, many intellectuals and young students have been plunged into unemployment and lack of schooling amidst the disaster of unemployment panic. They even have trouble affording breadsticks and soy milk for rent, so where would they have money to buy books? As a result, the purchasing power for books has decreased, and the business of bookstores has naturally declined day by day.</p>
<p>According to general booksellers, the major book markets in China have always been: Shanghai, Beijing, Northeast China, Nanjing, Guangdong, Fujian, Sichuan... and other places. But what about now? The Northeast has already been forcibly occupied by Japan, and Chinese books simply cannot be transported there for sale, which goes without saying. As for other places, the book market is not what it used to be and is very bleak and deserted. Now, let's first look at Beijing—</p>
<p>The "book market" in Beijing is mainly in the Dong'an Market and Xidan Shopping Center. General booksellers run small shops or set up stalls of various sizes in these two places to conduct their business. In the past, in addition to selling books from bookstores in Shanghai, they also secretly reprinted books that were easy to sell at low prices to obtain greater profits. Later, because it aroused serious interference from publishers and authors, the so-called "pirated books in Beijing" gradually decreased. Now, their business mainly consists of selling books published by various bookstores in Shanghai and selling books bought cheaply from poor students. However, because of the decrease in the purchasing power of books, the "book market" in Beijing is far from as lively as it used to be, and many book stalls no longer exist.</p>
<p>Next is Nanjing—According to the "Xu Bao" newspaper: "The bookstore industry in Nanjing was insignificant before the 17th year of the Republic of China (1928). However, since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, the bookstore industry has developed in response to the needs of the times. It was not until the winter of the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931) that the Nanjing Bookstore Trade Association was established to guide the development of the industry. Until recently, 85 companies have joined the association for cooperation... The business of the bookstore industry in Nanjing has reached its peak in recent years. In this autumn of recession, almost every bookstore is losing money. The reasons are: (1) Each bookstore has an excessive inventory of books. In order to seek economic activity, most small and medium-sized bookstores sell them off at a loss, such as setting a price of one yuan, then giving a 10% discount, and then a 90% discount. They do not listen to the association's restrictions, which makes it impossible to standardize book prices. (2) In Shanghai, although there is a book publishing review committee to review published books, the bookstores in this city do not know which books are prohibited due to a lack of information. They casually buy them from Shanghai and are prohibited from selling them when they arrive in Beijing, resulting in unexpected losses." Why do bookstores have "excessive inventories of books"? And why do they "sell off at a loss"? The answer is very simple: because the market is sluggish, few people buy books, and there is no other way but to do so!</p>
<p>The situation in other places such as Guangdong and Sichuan is the same. In the past, many bookstores in Guangzhou, Chengdu, and other places had commission agents in Shanghai who regularly purchased books from bookstores in Shanghai. However, now not only are some commission agents gone, but many bookstores have also closed their doors, losing their existence altogether. Therefore, bookstores in Shanghai do not know how many book debts they cannot recover in these places.</p>
<p>Shanghai is undoubtedly the center of the Chinese book industry, and most bookstores in other places sell books published by various bookstores in Shanghai. Because of the sluggishness of the entire market and the poor business of bookstores everywhere, the business of various bookstores in Shanghai, as the center of the book industry, is of course a big problem. Under these circumstances, bookstores in Shanghai, in order to survive, have to compete with each other. This phenomenon of competition is manifested in the publishing trends and general business methods of various bookstores.</p>
<p>In the Chinese publishing industry in 1934, we can see two major trends: one is that some small bookstores, because they cannot publish books in large quantities, can only rely on publishing magazines to maintain appearances; the other is that the larger bookstores, because they see that the purchasing power for general books has decreased and cannot promote sales, desperately reprint ancient books such as complete works and complete histories, with libraries, cultural institutions, and historical experts as their main customers. The result of the former trend is the creation of the name "Magazine Year"; the manifestation of the latter trend reveals a characteristic of the retro trend.</p>
<p>At the same time, with the development of the retro trend, there are also people who, because their economic strength is weak and they cannot follow "Commercial Press" and "Zhonghua Book Company" to reprint large quantities of ancient Chinese books, but also want to seize the opportunity of retro, and have no other way, so they desperately transport Western antiques. For example, Xin Ken Bookstore specializes in publishing antiques of Western European philosophy and science from the 17th and 18th centuries, and even the Greek era, to complement the "Siku Quanshu" ("Complete Library of the Four Treasures"), "Gujin Tushu Jicheng" ("Complete Collection of Illustrations and Writings from the Earliest to Current Times"), "Twenty-Five Histories"... and other national quintessences. However, unfortunately, new books of all kinds still have their buyers, and Chinese ancient books are also taken care of by libraries, cultural institutions, and those historical experts. Only these Western antiques, which have been criticized and sorted out by many great thinkers, are simply ignored. Therefore, the result of these speculators' speculation is not only unable to make their business prosper, but also creates a greater crisis in business. The problem is that there are no buyers, which leads to an increase in inventory, a lack of cash flow, and the inability to deal with general creditors.</p>
<p>As for general business methods, the competition among bookstores in Shanghai is also clearly manifested. Take "big price cuts" as an example. What we see is: today Bookstore A publishes an advertisement selling books at an 80% discount of the original price, and tomorrow Bookstore B will sell books at a 50% discount. Then, on the book market, there are cries of "30% discount", "40% discount"... and so on. If you are willing to go to the bookstores on Fourth Horse Road to take a look, then you will definitely see words such as "New books are sold as cheap goods," "One yuan sells for only eight cents," "How much does a pound of new books cost?" (Books have become rice and flour and must be measured in pounds!) and "Books are sold at a 10% discount and then an 80% discount," etc. At the same time, some bookstores, such as "Life Bookstore" and "Kaiming Bookstore," have even more advertisements, saying that out-of-town customers who purchase books from them can avoid remittance fees. And "Shanghai Magazine Company," after its opening, its "first cry" was: "Take unlimited responsibility to subscribe to magazines for you," "If there is a suspension of publication midway, you can take back the order from this company."... Such competition is probably unique in recent years.</p>
<p>In the mutual competition of bookstores, those with strong capital can of course participate in the competition and maintain appearances, but small bookstores with weak economic strength cannot survive. It is said that there are one or two small bookstores that owe too much money to printing houses and paper shops and cannot support themselves, and they are afraid that they will close down.</p>
<p>As a result of the recession in the book industry, the printing industry and the paper industry will naturally be affected. At the same time, the lives of general literati have also been greatly affected. It is very obvious that because books do not sell well, it is not easy to sell the manuscripts of literati. Even if they are sold, because the selling price is too low and the relationships of "discounts," "removing blank spaces," "removing punctuation," and even "removing foreign languages" (this is a new invention of a certain big bookseller recently!), the result of the literati spending a lot of time and racking their brains is very little; moreover, there is also a kind of bookseller who specializes in defrauding manuscripts, taking the translations of literati and printing them into books, and refusing to give them royalties or royalties. I have a friend who translated a book and published it in a small bookstore. Now the book has been reprinted, but he has not received a penny of royalties. When he recently went to the bookstore to ask for royalties, the booksellers actually joked with him: Haha! Your book was originally sent to us for publication, there are no royalties! Thank you! As a result, this friend had no choice but to grit his teeth, feel pain in his heart, and blame his "fate for being unfortunate!"—Such ridiculous things also happen! From this, we can imagine the disasters suffered by the general literati in the recession of the book industry.</p>
<h3 id="e336">The Chinese Publishing Industry Over the Past Year <a href="#e336" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c336" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">336</a></h3>
<p>— By Ms. Fan Pu</p>
<p>The development and changes of culture have time and space. In a certain era, based on a certain spatial environment, the trend and content of a certain cultural thought are embodied, which is almost a fact that does not need to be mentioned. Naturally, to understand the content and trend of the thought and culture of a certain era, we must observe it from both the author and the reader to see through its full form. However, there is also a simple method that can be used as an indicator for our testing, that is, to see the situation of the publishing industry. Of course, the psychology of the majority of people in the society, what the author wants to say, and what books and newspapers the readers love to read and require are in contradiction with the publishing industry. Because many authors write things that publishing institutions often do not want, so they cannot be published, and the knowledge and the books and newspapers that many readers need are not provided by the publishing industry. Therefore, to accurately explore the depths of social thought and understand its trends, this cannot be simply seen from the current situation of the publishing industry. Even so, the expression of social thought in a certain era, which becomes a characteristic of the cultural trend, and can be used as a material for understanding the present and the future, can also be seen from the expression of the publishing industry and used as a criterion for evaluation. Because the publishing industry can generally reflect the social environment. What it can publish is determined by the social environment. What works it can obtain for publication can also show what stage the social culture of this era has progressed to and what exploration achievements have been obtained. As for the sales of its publications, it is even more sufficient to explain the readers' requirements and tendencies. In a word, all of this embodies the content and trends of the entire society's thought, culture, and even politics and economy. Therefore, when we review the situation of the Chinese publishing industry over the past year, it is tantamount to reviewing the entire cultural development stage of China over the past year, especially hoping that readers will see it as a symbol of the history of Chinese thought over the past year.</p>
<p>Although the number of books in the Chinese publishing industry in 1934 was not necessarily more than in 1928 and 1929, it always exceeded that of 1915 to 1927. In terms of magazines, we are sure that it cannot catch up with 1925 to 1927 in terms of quantity, but last year can indeed be said to be a magazine year. According to the statistics provided to us by Mr. Shu Xincheng in the Cultural Construction Monthly, from 1928 to 1931, 1,000 kinds of books were registered in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, 886 kinds in 1932, and 1,890 kinds in 1933, totaling 3,776 kinds. In terms of magazines and newspapers, there were 1,403 kinds from September 1928 to December 1932, 1,919 kinds in 1933, totaling 3,331 kinds. And from January to September 1934, only 654 kinds of newspapers and magazines were registered in the Ministry of Internal Affairs. According to the statistics in Shen Bao's advertisements, the total number of newly published publications up to October was only 1,286 kinds, and he did not distinguish between books, newspapers, and magazines. Therefore, 1934 seems to be far behind 1933. But these numbers are not very accurate. Because from 1928 to 1932, most of the books were not registered. The actual number should be far above the registered number. And in 1934, even including books and magazines, it is still not enough according to Shen Bao's advertisements. Because most of the advertisements in Shen Bao are limited to publications in Beijing and Shanghai, and most of the publications in Tianjin, Beijing, Guangzhou, and other places are advertised in local newspapers, so that number is far from enough to summarize the whole country. Therefore, according to the general estimation of referring to the facts, from 1925 to 1927, there were few books and many magazines, and in the three or four years after 1928, more books were published and fewer magazines were published. In 1934, the number of books was less than in the previous period, but it was not particularly behind. It was just that the direction had changed somewhat. As for magazines, they were much more developed than after 1928.</p>
<p>What are the reasons for this change in the publishing industry? Generally speaking, it is because 1925 to 1927 was a period of action. In that era, most people spent all their time and energy on action, and they did not have time to do in-depth research. What they needed was only simple and realistic propaganda and practical guidance. Therefore, few people read entire books. At that time, not only did activists need propaganda and brief realistic action guidance, but also social organizations were particularly developed. Each school had several or more organizations, and each organization mostly had its own publications. In society, there were also many general organizations and publications. These are all the reasons why book publishing could not keep up with the development of magazines in that era. But after 1928, the period of widespread action passed, and the activities of social organizations also decreased. The tendency of static research gradually replaced dynamic activities. The deepening of theory and knowledge, and the reflection on past historical events cannot be satisfied by simple magazines. Therefore, the number of magazines gradually decreased later, and the introduction of books, especially theoretical books of basic knowledge, became developed in those years. Many small new culture bookstores that sprang up like mushrooms after the rain in those years were enough to express the characteristics of the publishing industry at that time. As the era moved to 1934, due to the determination of objective circumstances, the theoretical introduction and research of social sciences encountered difficulties. Therefore, the publishing direction since 1928 could no longer continue as before, and this also affected the book publishing aspect. However, the static state of the era has not only not changed, but has also deepened more and more. Therefore, research is still an objectively required condition. So the quantity of book publications in 1934 did not show a special decline, but only the direction showed a clear change from the past. As for magazines, there are many reasons to decide its activity in objective causes. First, because there were two kinds of thought competing fiercely in this year, one in the offensive, in order to win complete leadership and replace it, worked hard to publish its magazines as propaganda weapons. But what about the side being attacked? It is still unwilling to show weakness, often changing its style and content at any time to try to maintain its position, and constantly publishing magazines. Second, the current China is in a period of national crisis. Everyone is in a state of bewilderment and anxiety. There are indeed endless practical problems in front of us, making everyone feel that they cannot ignore them and must study and understand them. But magazines are relatively easy to express opinions, because those short essays can still vaguely and partially reveal some opinions. Therefore, the large number of magazines in 1934 precisely shows that Chinese society has formed a social depression and complaint phenomenon that it has to say a few words because the crisis is urgent. Third, the world and China's recession has made ordinary intellectuals unemployed and impoverished, and the decline of the new book industry has made their last way out of eating written food increasingly narrow. Therefore, everyone flocks to running magazines as a way to find a way out for themselves, solve temporary life, and even recruit unemployed literati as a basis for activities. So the special development of magazines this year is also enough to explain the inside of the intellectual's life panic. In short, the publishing industry in 1934 formed its first characteristic of being a magazine year because of the above-mentioned reasons.</p>
<p>It has already been proposed above that the publishing industry in 1934 has changed its direction. This is not only a problem that can be proposed, but also a characteristic of the publishing industry this year. Because in the past publishing industry, the trend of books was towards the discussion and introduction of general principles and principles of social sciences. But this kind of discussion and introduction is contradictory to the environment at the present time, and it has to be stopped. Therefore, two universal new tendencies have occurred in the publishing industry in terms of publishing books. On the one hand, old antiques have reappeared: the most obvious is the reprint of the Siku Treasures by the Commercial Press, with two or three hundred and one kinds in the first collection alone, totaling about two thousand boats; the Zhonghua Book Company's abridged edition of Gujin Tushu Jicheng, about 800 volumes; the Song Qisha Tibetan Sutra 592 volumes, and the Four Series, Four Essentials, Wanwei Bie Collection, and Liaohai Series are all being printed. In addition, there are also many small bookstores and social organizations that reprint old books. Therefore, if it is right to say that 1934 is a magazine year, then we can also call it a year of the re-emergence of old books and antiques. On the other hand, although there are relatively few practical theoretical research and introductions for the publication of books, in addition to re-releasing domestic old goods, there is also a new atmosphere of introducing philosophy and science from abroad. The Commercial Press has recently selected many famous world philosophy and science works for translation. The Sun Yat-sen Culture and Education Center has published many such books in the first issue, and the second issue is also selecting and translating famous philosophy and science works. Xin Ken Bookstore has already published many philosophy and science series, and is still continuing to translate them. Therefore, the publishing industry in 1934 can be said to be a year of theoretical and practical science introduction. In particular, theoretical natural science in natural science introduced many kinds of world-famous masterpieces in this year. The former tendency is to run back to the old road. The negative effect on the progress of Chinese thought and culture will have a temporary impact, which is undeniable. In the latter, we must not underestimate it, thinking that it has gone out of the practice circle and has no many benefits. It must be known that in China, the profound understanding and understanding of nature has always been backward. The ultimate problem of mankind is the problem of dealing with nature. The correct understanding of nature will become the starting point of correct philosophical thinking, and can promote the birth of the correct outlook on life, form the correct social outlook, and reach the correct practical theory. In this way, these introductions of philosophy and science are precisely indicating that the Chinese ideological circle is making further efforts to deeply understand the entire world. In the near future, a Chinese ideological renaissance will be led by the progress of natural science to achieve social restoration. Therefore, the change in the direction of the publishing industry in 1934 is to express its second characteristic with the contradictory phenomenon of old book reprints and scientific introductions running in opposite directions.</p>
<p>Secondly, judging from the situation of the publishing industry in 1934, on the one hand, it can prove that China's current economic situation is recession and the poverty of the general public is increasing. On the other hand, the cultural movement has further reduced its universality, and it shows that most young people do not like to read books and do not seek further education. Only a few people are working hard on the aforementioned research on philosophy and natural science. We can get proof of these phenomena from many facts. First, although there were still a considerable number of books published throughout 1934, the purchase of old books was mostly based on cultural institutions such as school libraries as employers. The sales of new philosophy and science were also very bad, and very few people bought them. All bookstores often have big sales, and even the big bookstores such as Commercial Press and Zhonghua, which have never been discounted, have joined the big sale competition, and some bookstores have big sales all year round, and even have discounts of 10% or 20%. However, despite such fierce price competition, the result is still poor business, and many bookstores cannot maintain themselves. This precisely shows the phenomenon that the people are poor and unable to buy books to read, or that many wealthy young students are unwilling to read books. Second, boring novels and pictorials with fleshiness sell better than serious books. When a newspaper publishes sufficient news about sports and movies, people rush to buy it. This shows that most young people are mentally bored and depraved, do not take academics seriously, and are wholeheartedly indulging in boring pastimes. In fact, the special popularity of magazines and the best-selling</p>
<p>(The following continues on page 5)</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>of essays, in which there is also the tendency of most people to not be willing to seek further education. Although it is not to say that reading magazines is wrong, nor is it to say that essay publications are completely meaningless, it is precisely a symbol of the reader's simple calculations on economics and understanding problems. Therefore, the mentality of casually buying one or two magazines or essays and looking at them is fully revealed. All of the above-mentioned phenomena are the third characteristic of the culture in 1934 embodied in the publishing industry.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in terms of the content of publications in 1934, we have already said in the front that books are characterized by the simultaneous development of the trend towards dazzling antiques and the introduction of philosophy and science. However, in terms of magazines, there is also a clear tendency that can be identified. Most magazines only focus on the study of international politics on political issues, and mostly focus on the analysis of international economic panic and the collapse of China's rural economy and the decline of the city economy on economic issues. There is a great tendency to not explore the issues of China's national independence and freedom. This is just like the prevalence of essays and humorous writing in 1934. It is also one of the characteristics of the publishing industry.</p>
<p>In summary, the overview of the publishing industry in 1934 embodies the phenomenon of both advantages and disadvantages in the Chinese ideological circle and cultural movement. On the one hand, it is the extreme development of ideological differentiation. On the other hand, it shows the general recession, so most people are gradually eliminated from the knowledge circle and cannot receive the grace of publishing culture. The general youth's weariness of learning and the decline and stagnation of the new book industry are also serious problems. We hope that in 1935, the baptism of science will be popularized in the general society, and this will save the decline of the new book industry. That is the fortune of China's cultural future and the fortune of the Chinese nation.</p>
<h3 id="e337">The Esperanto Movement in China Over the Past Year <a href="#e337" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c337" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">337</a></h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>The Esperanto movement in China is a wing of the global Esperanto movement, just as China is a link in the world. Therefore, when reviewing the Esperanto movement in China over the past year, it is necessary to simultaneously look back at the international Esperanto movement.</p>
<p>The past year was a turbulent year politically, and similarly, it was an eventful year for the international Esperanto movement. In the past year, various characters have appeared on the stage of the international Esperanto movement. Some even used the banner of so-called "neutralism" (advocating a conservative neutral attitude towards religion and politics) to attract audiences, but because these actors themselves had long lost the enthusiasm of idealism, the result was just a chorus of boos from the audience. Some put on the clothing of dead people, acting as brown propagandists. Some played with beautiful lines to fool honest people. The humorous school with "Pirate" as its trademark, and the news reporter faction ("Nia Gazeto" faction) which flaunts collectivism, also appeared on stage in 1934. Truly, a star-studded gathering, how lively!</p>
<p>But, what events in the international Esperanto movement over the past year are particularly worth mentioning? Well, let's not join the crowd and calmly examine it—</p>
<p>First is the Esperanto movement under Mr. Hitler's rule. Since Hitler came to power, Esperanto has been regarded as a "Jewish creation" and rejected. So those neutralist gentlemen were so scared that they dared not even mention neutralism. It turns out that neutralism is the "third kind of person," and in present-day Germany, you are not allowed to fall in the middle. So a whole group of neutralists came wearing brown uniforms. This completely exposed the "neutralist peep show." But they said that Esperanto and the "internal idea" (the ideal of human love advocated by Zamenhof) were originally two different things and irrelevant. In this way, the "internal idea" has become an "external idea." However, in Germany, there is another miracle. The GLEA (German Workers' Esperanto Association), which has been banned for a long time, has not disappeared, and is still engaged in research with difficulty. When the IPE (International of Workers Esperantists) held a congress in France last August, the GLEA officially sent more than ten representatives, bringing with them 500 marks donated by the GLEA to the IPE, and attended the congress in a grand manner.</p>
<p>Second is the IPE after its departure. Since the IPE's headquarters in Germany was sealed, it moved to the Netherlands and began to reorganize. By last year's congress, it had almost returned to its original state. Branches in various countries have cooperated with workers' Esperanto speakers belonging to other international organizations in international communication research, and have achieved considerable success. Some workers' Esperanto groups in Hungary and other countries have announced their separation from SAT (World Anational Association, also a workers' Esperanto international organization) and joined the IPE. On the other hand, SAT cadres are still insisting on strange theories such as "colonial people are not happy to be liberated," "it is not unreasonable for other ethnic groups to develop resources that cannot be developed by the local ethnic group," aren't they indirectly supporting imperialism? Many SAT members are eagerly hoping to cooperate with the IPE, which can be seen from the resolution passed at last year's SAT congress to reunify the workers' Esperanto movement.</p>
<p>Third is the new trend of the Soviet Esperanto movement. In recent years, with the pace of industrial construction, the Soviet Union has been vigorously carrying out the education of worker internationalism, and Esperanto has been widely used. Especially among children, in the so-called Young Pioneers, a lively Esperanto movement is being carried out. Here, let me give a concrete fact. In a primary school in the Azerbaijan Republic of Transcaucasia, a team of young people used Esperanto to communicate with the world and all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union. The children designated one person from each country as an "ambassador," responsible for collecting materials from that country and conducting very broad and interesting communication. As a result, in last year's All-Soviet Children's International Communication Competition, they won the best result—first place. So the children were sent to travel all over the Soviet Union, and also sent to Moscow to receive awards. At the award ceremony, the Soviet Esperanto Union also sent someone to give a public speech. On the way back, more than thirty representatives of various groups accompanied these children home, but on the way, these adults all swore that they would definitely learn Esperanto from now on. This fact tells us what kind of future Esperanto will have.</p>
<p>In addition, there are many, many events worth mentioning in the international Esperanto movement. Here we can only mention the following: (1) Publishing activities—a novel with the hero Chapajev of the Soviet Civil War era as the protagonist (translated from Russian), Dante's "Inferno" (it is said that the translator learned the original text in order to translate this masterpiece), "Esperanto Encyclopedia," "Pick Up the Gun" (a novel depicting the life of the Soviet army), "Whither Goest Thou" (translated by Zamenhof's daughter), "City of Towers" (an original novel depicting the unemployment panic in Austria)... "Chemical Industry" (monthly magazine, compiled and printed by Soviet chemical workers Esperantists), "Soviet School" (compiled and printed by Soviet educators Esperantists), "Our Newspaper" (newspaper-type monthly magazine), "Pirate" humorous monthly magazine)... (2) New groups—"Saar-Alsace-Lorraine Workers' Esperanto Association" (publishes two kinds of publications); "International Progressive Esperanto Educators' Federation," publishes the organ "Educators' Torch" and "Worldwide Esperanto Education Communication." (3) Trends of IAREV—"International Association of Revolutionary Esperanto Writers" (IAREV) publishes the organ "Mass Literature," and plans to publish literary correspondence, assist writers from various countries, collect data from all over the world, and translate (full or excerpt translation) various masterpieces—customized translation.</p>
<p>Now let's turn back and take a look at the domestic situation: How much progress has the Esperanto movement in China made in the past year?</p>
<p>First is the progress in propaganda. Today's young Esperanto speakers are no longer like our predecessors, who treat Esperanto worship as a panacea for world peace, saying that Esperanto is easy to learn, grammar has only sixteen rules, and shutting their mouths world is the same, human being is a family. It is not enough to use ease to publicize, and utopian preaching is even more harmful to obscuring reality. We can only show the true meaning of Esperanto and gain more supporters in concrete and practical work, in participating in activities that help society and culture. From this understanding, the propaganda work has achieved a part of it. Just talking about the item of literal propaganda, we no longer easily find those beautiful and poisonous phrases like a fool talking in his sleep. And in various important newspapers and periodicals in China, there are often texts about Esperanto and works translated from Esperanto. For example, in "Shen Bao", "Shen Bao Monthly", "China Daily", "China Monthly", "Literature", "Literature Quarterly", "Reader", "Modern", "Youth World", "Tai Bai", "World Knowledge",... there have been such texts. On the one hand, this shows the efforts of the Esperanto speakers themselves, and on the other hand, it is also because the editors and the general readers have a deeper understanding of Esperanto. We believe that this kind of propaganda method (naturally, the significance of this work is not only propaganda) is legitimate.</p>
<p>Second is the development of the movement. With the expansion of propaganda, the movement has indeed made some new progress in the past year. In the Esperanto circle, there are currently many new Esperanto speakers—new people are beginning to appear. From another perspective, this is also the improvement of general language skills. One year ago, even half a year ago, some people who had just started reading the alphabet were already able to use Esperanto to debate and converse, and were already able to use Esperanto to read, write letters, write essays, and translate. From the perspective of the overall trend of the movement, it has also begun to step onto a brand-new stage, namely the popularization of Esperanto. Esperanto has not only entered schools, but also entered stores, factories, and rural areas. In the inland Esperanto movement, new groups have been established in Guizhou, Jing County, Hebei, and other places. There are also more or less developments in Peiping, Qingdao, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Taiyuan, Nanjing, Changsha, and Chengdu. Here we will not go into details due to space limitations. The "Shanghai Esperanto Association," which has a long history, was destroyed in Zhabei during the January 28 Incident. Since its revival the year before last, we have been hoping that it can work hard for the future of our language. Unfortunately, it suddenly stagnated in 1934, and the monthly magazine "Green Light" was also discontinued. This has to be said to be a pity.</p>
<p>Third is the expansion of the scope of work. For the sake of practical Esperanto, the inevitable result is that Esperanto speakers work separately in various fields, which is what I want to say here about the expansion of the scope of work. The movement in the past year has paid attention to this point. Today's Esperanto speakers have felt that a single Esperanto movement is not enough. What is important is the movement of applying Esperanto. Therefore, the communication movement in the past year has been a little more active than the previous year. Other examples include the research on language theory, the translation of literary works, the translation of foreign correspondence, and so on.</p>
<p>Fourth is the mass language debate. The participation of Esperanto speakers in the mass language debate, as well as the enthusiasm and concern for this issue in the Esperanto central mass language discussion, are worth special mention. In particular, the Latinization of Chinese calligraphy has received support from Chinese Esperanto speakers. In this debate, it shows that modern Chinese Esperanto speakers are no longer those unrealistic dreamers who do not eat human food and despise the national language, but the most practical workers in the language garden. They want to organically link the international language movement and the reform movement of the national language. This is a major event in the Esperanto world in 1934.</p>
<p>In terms of publishing, all places are still sluggish due to economic difficulties. The more important publications in the past year include: Esperanto Reader (Shanghai Esperanto Bookstore), Plena Votaro (Comprehensive Bookstore Reprinted), Petro (Elementary Textbook, Comprehensive Bookstore Reprinted), Chinese Esperanto Dictionary (Peiping), Immensee (Peiping), Salome (Chengdu),... In terms of periodicals, "The World" published in Shanghai is currently the most content-rich publication, and others include "The Sower" in Taiyuan, "The Light of Esperanto" in Peiping, "Guangzhou Esperanto Monthly" in Guangzhou, and Verdemulo, "Green Banner" in Chengdu, and so on.</p>
<p>The Esperanto movement in China has a very promising future. The development of the Esperanto movement of small and weak nations, as Akita Ujaku said, is of great significance to the entire world movement. However, there are still countless difficulties lying in front of the Chinese Esperanto movement, which need to be overcome by us one by one. Esperanto speakers, work hard!</p>

Like your gentle and affectionate eyes, your red and radiant lips, your lovely angel, is a jade body created by a sculptor in heaven. I look at you from the front, I look at you from the side, I see clearly the carvings on your whole body, my ideal beauty! The fragrance of the beautiful shadows in your paintings permeates into my nasal cavity and transmits into my heart." "Dear sir, if we could meet at this moment, you would be able to see my eyes and understand what my eyes are presenting. I am too shy to finally say those seven words with hesitation."</p>

<h3 id="e341">The Nature of Newsreels and Their Production (Part 2) <a href="#e341" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c341" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">341</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>Representing a Page in History Recorded</p>
<p>Value Estimated by Event Changes</p>
<p>No sooner said than done, bullets flew horizontally. George, behind the South King's car, immediately saw two photographers hit by stray bullets and fell down, one already fatally wounded. A timid person would have run away at this time, but he steadied his mind and immediately aimed the camera at the car, capturing every important shot. George felt that his harvest was not enough, so he rushed into the crowd and took many amazing shots inside the South King's car. At this time, the South King's face was already pale and he was dead in the car. Raymond saw the tragedy happen, first recorded all the chaotic noise, and then took a circular shot. The Mackie brothers, they photographed the assassin's weapon, held in the hand of a guard, and also photographed the assassin lying on the ground after being killed by the crowd and the guards. After the tragedy, the chaos of order, the noise of the crowd, everything was captured into the camera and recorded into the microphone.</p>
<p>Photography and sound recording were so dangerous at that time, but their responsibility absolutely could not be avoided. After this newsreel gained an unexpected harvest, it then encountered many difficulties. An airplane, already prepared, wanted to carry the shot film to Paris, organize it in Paris, and then immediately transport it to the Bremen ship to send it to New York, but the representative of the Fox Company was arrested in La Bouget. The film transported from Marseille was all detained because there were orders that films about the Marseille tragedy were not allowed to be transported overseas. Later, after many difficulties and careful consideration by the authorities, all the films were returned, but the stipulated condition was that the film could only be made under the supervision of the French Film Examination Board. After many disputes with the authorities, the shackles were lifted, and the Fox Company immediately transported the films to the Washington ship by plane without stopping. This ship sailed to the United States the next day. Upon arrival in the United States, it was immediately sent to the Hollywood Fox studio by plane. Quickly made this newsreel. During the filming, there were many dangers and difficulties, but it is indeed a valuable record of a page in history. The South King's landing, the car's progress, the assassination, Alexander's remains, Bardou's paleness, everything, is a rare newsreel!</p>
<p>From the above description, we can immediately discover several principles in the nature and production of newsreels.</p>
<p>(1) Newsreels can represent a page in history, and are easier to make a deep impression on people than written records.</p>
<p>(2) The value of newsreels cannot be estimated in advance, and rises or falls depending on the temporary expansion or reduction of the event.</p>
<p>(3) Valuable newsreels can be preserved permanently, so that future generations can see a page in history on the screen and in reality.</p>
<p>(4) When filming newsreels, the work of the staff should be properly allocated in advance.</p>
<p>(5) The filming of newsreels is the sole responsibility of the photographer. Unlike general films, there is a director in charge, and the photographer's responsibility is lighter.</p>
<p>(6) The photographer who shoots newsreels must have a spirit of adventure and courage, so that even if an incident occurs, they can remain calm and collect the film in the chaos. The technique must be quick, and the thinking must be agile, because if a general shot is broken, it can be replaced, and even several can be replaced. The dynamic state of the news disappears in a flash and cannot be replayed once. If the technique is slow, it cannot be captured. What should be included in the shot and what can be abandoned to avoid wasting film must be adapted to the situation.</p>
<p>(7) When many film companies are filming the same newsreel at the same time, they must win by surprise and shoot the film that others don't have time to shoot.</p>
<p>(8) After the film is shot, the transportation and production must be fast, so that it can be released to the public as soon as possible, in order to satisfy the audience's news desire and overwhelm the competition in the same industry. (End)</p>
<p>Movie Talk</p>
<h3 id="e342">Review of "Secret Boudoir" <a href="#e342" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c342" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">342</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>What Every Woman Knows – Nanjing –</p>
<p>The film adaptation of the novel "What Every Woman Knows," which this publication previously translated as "Admonitions for Good Wives," is now being released under the title "Secret Boudoir." The former translation at least managed to convey the content, while the latter, apart from the allure of sensual excitement, seems to lack any other meaning.</p>
<p>The ideology of virtuous mothers and good wives still holds considerable interest among American filmmakers, as demonstrated in works like "Little Women." Now, the play "Secret Boudoir" by J.M. Barrie is being adapted for the screen, continuing to promote this ideology and serving as a stark contrast to the morally decadent modern women.</p>
<p>Regarding the works of the English author Barrie (Sir J.M. Barrie), China has previously seen Hong Shen's translations of "The Second Dream" (a three-act play) and "The Admirable Crichton," among others. "What Every Woman Knows," translated as "Secret Boudoir," was originally a four-act play. His works demonstrate a profound sense of human relationships and worldly experiences, tinged with deep sorrow. He is an aging modern writer whose philosophy and outdated worldview are undoubtedly far removed from reality.</p>
<p>Now, we might as well observe how the playwright presents his theme as a whole, which is most evident in the male protagonist: He is a stubborn man who is diligent and studious. Therefore, despite being a common laborer, he eventually wins a labor party election with the help of others and is appointed to the cabinet. However, he needs a good inner helper to manage his life and assist his career. Thus, the virtuous wife, played by Helen Hayes, appears. A young working-class man, a high-ranking cabinet official, and a virtuous wife who sacrifices herself in various aspects of love to help her husband achieve fame are, in the playwright's view, undoubtedly beneficial to the modern social system.</p>
<p>In terms of the relative importance of the male and female protagonists, the female protagonist's adherence to womanly virtue naturally occupies a major position in the play. However, people will not overlook the question of for whom is the womanly virtue that she expresses, which she believes "every woman should know," actually intended? Considering this connection further reveals the influence of the playwright's old worldview. As for the manipulative tactics used to win the love of her husband, which are frequently seen in American films, they do not hinder the original theme and further glorify the personality of the female protagonist.</p>
<p>Regarding the theme as described above, based on our current understanding, it is adequately expressed cinematically, realizing the theme of the play.</p>
<p>There is a special kind of charm here. In a serene atmosphere, a slight, bitter smile of life is emitted. Especially due to the success of Helen Hayes's acting, particularly in the final scene, the so-called laughter through tears is indeed portrayed quite profoundly. However, this work may feel dull to audiences who only seek pleasure. For example, the laughter is so subtle, and the dialogue is so heavy and tedious. After the climax of the election, the emotionally charged scenes, such as Helen discovering her husband's secrets, are difficult to please the general audience. There is an air of melancholy here, but melancholy is not as popular as unconscious laughter, although there are many humorous scenes.</p>
<p>Another point to mention is that the male lead's speech is very slurred, although his movements show that he has received good basic training. As for Helen Hayes's makeup at the age of twenty-six, it seems a bit old, and the first part is not as natural as the second part, which is not unrelated to her own age.</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3 id="e343">My Views on "Renzhu" <a href="#e343" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c343" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">343</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Hui</p>
<p>After watching "Renzhu," I couldn't help but feel disappointed. I can't believe that at this time when domestic films are making progress, there is still such a regression!</p>
<p>It is very obvious that the author, in order to "cater to the audience's psychology" and for "business reasons," does not hesitate to bring back this vulgar and anachronistic "lily of the valley." This is considered a painful matter.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, "Renzhu" is also a failure. The entire play cannot escape the atmosphere of a civilized drama, and the lengthy dialogues and stiff expressions do not give people a pleasant feeling. The director, in this regard, only achieves a "flat" level, without any clever techniques.</p>
<p>Regarding the actors, Fan Xuepeng is fundamentally a failure, and Chen Qiufeng's unsuitability for the character naturally makes the effort unrewarding. Ye Qiuxin has achieved considerable success.</p>
<p>Finally, it is worth mentioning that the sound in the picture is still clear.</p>

<p>— Su Yin</p>
<p>Suddenly, someone knocked on the door outside, knocking urgently. The person who came in after the door opened was none other than the groom himself. He held a silver cocktail shaker in his hand and sang love songs in his mouth. As he sang, he walked to Mary's massage bed. Mary exclaimed, "Baby!" Dillon didn't say a word but frowned at her. After a while, he shrugged his shoulders and said, "Oh, is this pile of mess the woman I'm going to marry?" He then took his hand and smeared some of the ointment from Mary's face onto his nose and smelled it. He laughed, "Hmm, vanilla flavor!" Then he leaned down and kissed her face, covering his own face with a layer of shiny ointment.</p>
<p>At this time, Paula was a little angry. She coughed and raised her voice to the groom, "Dillon Todd, you've been running around since you were six years old, and you come to places you shouldn't." Dillon shamelessly said, "That's the most interesting thing. Mary, you look beautiful! Why don't we have a nude wedding ceremony?" Paula jumped up and said, "Dillon Todd, are you leaving or not? You also have a bachelor party tonight." So, their group, led by the bridesmaid Eleanor, drove the groom out. After everyone left, Mary lay alone on the massage bed, looking at the ceiling, thinking to herself that she was a wild horse of a child, and now she had grown up to be like a fresh flower, even with her face covered in ointment and a white sheet covering her body, she still looked delicate and charming.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the phone rang. Mary lay on the bed, glanced at the phone, and waited quietly for someone to answer it. But the bell rang more and more urgently, and still no one answered. Obviously, Paula had already left and couldn't hear it. Mary sighed, struggled to get up from the bed, wrapped the sheet around her body, and walked staggeringly to the phone table. She picked up the receiver and shouted, "Hello... Who? Who? Jeffrey? Jeffrey? Baby! Where are you now? Oh... Oh... Come quickly! I have something important to tell you." Mary shouted intermittently, happily not believing her ears. Jeffrey had been gone for these past few years, and he had safely returned and was now in New York City! That's right, he was indeed in New York. He was now at the pier, calling from a public phone booth. This was the first thing he did after returning to his home country. He pushed his hat to the back of his head, cheerfully facing the telephone, as if his whole world was already revolving at the other end of the phone line.</p>
<p>Jeffrey shouted, "I have a lot to tell you too. What? Spain? Spain is great! Tell me, what do you have to tell me? Can't you say it over the phone? What's wrong? Okay, okay. I'll be right there." He hung up the phone and immediately ran outside, wanting to call a car to go to Mary's house. He arrived outside on the pier; immediately he stopped. He saw a thin man, holding an umbrella in his hand, looking around on the pier. Jeffrey saw him and couldn't help but shout, "Haysbert!" The man heard someone call his name, turned his head, smiled slightly at Jeffrey, and then unhurriedly walked over and said, "Good, good. I finally didn't miss it. I've already run to several piers." The two of them then shook hands and exchanged greetings. Haysbert gave Jeffrey an umbrella and said, "I originally wanted to buy flowers, but I ran to the old place where the flower shop was, and there was no flower shop there anymore, only an umbrella shop, so I bought an umbrella for you." They spoke as they walked out of the pier, hailed a car, and drove straight to Mary's house. (To be continued)</p>
