<h3 id="c14">美國能否爲中國改變其銀政策 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— 端</p>
<p>自美國提高銀價以來。我國經濟方面。倍增困難。羣望美國能緩和其購銀政策。俾得稍紓喘息。以救眉急。而尤熱望於美國來華經濟考察團。將其耳聞目觀。歸而語其國人。稍稍改變以往態度。但能否生效。尚未可知。姑就美國歷年對銀價所持之熊度。一推考之。</p>
<p>美國素以產銀著。銀礦業在其國內。擁有偉大之勢力。每遇銀價下落。銀派議員。爲其利害關係。常出死力以爭。因是美國用吸收白銀提高銀價之辦法。不自今始。一八七八。年歐洲諸國停鑄銀幣。銀價大落。美政府即通過法案。規定政府每月購入白銀二百萬元至四百萬元。而銀價仍難維持。及至一八九〇年。倫教紐約發生大恐慌。美國乃制定休門條例。（Sherman　Law）每月按市價購入生銀四百五十萬盎斯。然以產銀日　。維持之策終屬失敗。一八九二年銀價繼續大落。又在不魯捨爾召集貨幣會議。至一八九三年休門條例宣告廢止。銀價乃自四十一辦士速年下跌。直至歐戰發生。始漸回高。一九二〇年二月十日登峯造極。紐約銀價高至一元四角四分。倫敦銀價亦達八十九辦士。但六月中旬。銀價又發生大反動。所跌較前達一半之數。嗣後如江河日下。至一九三一年英鎊貶值後。倫敦銀價曾低至十二便士。美銀於翌年最低亦至二角四分五。此十二年間。銀價之變遷。如山之高。如谷之深。極盡變動之能。誠巨觀也。美國銀派議員爲求保護其所代表者之利益計。圖將銀價提高至一元二角九分。使金與銀成一與十六之比。遂致造成今日之局面。</p>
<p>美國之提高銀價。既爲其自身利益着想。在自謀者。往往爲利慾所衝動。不惜損人以利己。此常情也。美國果能幡然改圖。祇有出於兩途。一則銀產供給增加。收不勝收。終難以達其提高之目的。二則損人不利己。深覺與其所期待者不相符。而歸於放棄。要之。苟非美國人自己要放棄而放棄。則不得已而放棄之謂也。</p>
<p>銀產常爲鋅鉛等礦副產物。欲求銀產增加。勢必述帶而增加鋅鉛等之主產物。假使鋅鉛等物因此而陷於過剩。銀價縱高。所得能否補償其損失。固疑問也。卽不然。銀產因銀價上升。而亦發生變動。屆時而再提高銀價乎抑爲放棄乎。然此非本文所欲討論。吾人所欲問者。美國人不以提高銀價爲促進用銀國之購買力乎。假使美國對華貿易仍繼續保持其優勢。則彼銀派議員尤振振有辭。以爲得計。望其改變政策。不啻與虎謀皮。然中國之經濟情形正相反。銀價愈高。生計愈困。美國貨縱以匯價而低廉。中國人終有無力購買之一日。爲期且巳不遠。但中國現在已至仰人而食待人而衣之地步。非外國貨幾難度日。此則言之固痛。而爲事實亦無庸諱言。因此將來必擇外國貨中比較最便宜者而用之。此則恐非美國工商業所能與之競爭也。故逼中國人走入此路。雖不能謂爲美國人自取其咎。要亦不明中國情形發生誤解袖手旁觀之爲害也。</p>
<p>自助乃得人助。求人不如求己。美國人從其自己打算而有此計畫。我中國人亦應從自己打算而謀新出路。明知現在中國經濟情形牽涉殊多。阻碍橫生。百孔千瘡。補救匪易。但不應畏難苟安。徒以向人乞憐爲事。應打起精神。羣策羣力。竭其才智。以與外來之警濤駭浪相抗。焉知不轉禍爲福。而有共慶安瀾之日也。</p>

<p>— 本報特派記者賡雅</p>
<p>平漢路風光及定縣槪况</p>
<p>爲欲參觀中華平民教育促進會在河北定縣之實騐工作、特由鄭州轉平漢路、搭晚特快車北上、車由漢口開來、原多空位、過鄭適有某大學旅行團上車、人多勢衆、驟形擁擠、男生矯捷先登者、恒一人覇坐二三位、爭獻女生以寬坐、己復他適經營、一時喧笑歌唱之聲、幾將輪軌轆轆之音完全掩盡、</p>
<p>車抵黃河南站、停修車頭、良久始行、旋過長約二里之山洞、出洞卽黃河鐵橋、車經共上、濡濡緩行、俯視濁浪排空、滔滔東流、橋長約六里許、原爲一百零三孔、因戰爭炸燬其三、曾拆邊三孔補之、故今恰有百孔、保險年限早已逾期、從前車行需時六七分、今須慢至二十分餘、以防激烈震動、發生傾覆危險、橋墩深約十五公尺、近年迭經洪流衝刷橋基、尤其二十年大水災時墩根幾被衝露、路局急於各橋墩下、時拋巨量大石以抗水力、惟拋石旣多、勢成攔河壩、恐上游河床日高、釀成水災、故豫省府曾通知路方、不得再拋石下河、至於重修新橋之經費、路方早於營業收入下按年提存「折舊費」、已先後積成鉅額、本應早日興工、惜一被攫於直奉戰時、再被提於十九年之役、的欵已無着落、現僅雇一外籍監工、每農巡視一次、以騐可否通車、亦云險矣、最近鐵部巳會同黃河水利委員會、勘定原橋稍東地　、建築新橋、估價約需二三千萬元、聞有向經委會及庚欵保委會商借之說、</p>
<p>淸晨三四時、天色漸明、車已別豫界而入冀境、適過邯鄲縣北之王化堡、土名黃粱夢、有韓祖廟、某述其地神話、詡詡動人、嗣抵邢臺、（舊順德府治、亦卽漢末張舟起兵之鉅鹿）、烟囪高聳、有電汽工廠、工商尙稱發達、上下車人亦頗多、馬頭鎭燒焦炭、磚砌露天圓窰、行列整齊、如埋數十大缸於地下、烈焰噴吒如火山臭熱不可一刻耐、石家莊多新式建築、紅瓦碧磗、崇樓垂柳、景象可人、地當正太路與平漢接軌點、商貨出入山西、多取道於此、故日臻繁盛、此去正定新樂、直至目的地定縣、平疇沃野、益覺遼闊、遠山含翠、野樹新綠、一路美景、應接不暇、</p>
<p>定縣東西廣約六十里、南北長約九十里、面積五千四百方里、戶口有六萬八千餘戶、人口總數、約計四十萬人、四境平坦無山、爲一平原、十質含沙、以肥沃論、非上選也、所有農田、賴井水灌漑者約占十之七八、其他仰賴溝河灌漑之稻田、亦數十頃、土地分配、據平教會調查、自耕農占百分之六十三、自耕兼租種百分之二十四、自耕兼租出百分之五、純粹佃農白分之五、其他百分之三、農田共計一百五十餘萬畝、每戶田地、不滿二十五畝者占百分之六十三、二十五畝至四十九畝者百分之二十三、五十至九十九畝者百分之六、百畝以上者祇占其一、</p>
<p>主要農產物、首爲穀子小麥、次豆類·高粱·棉花·甘薯·玉蜀黍·花生·大麥·及其他、棉花花生、近年有增加產量之趨向、工業品有土布·綫蓆·柳罐·葦箔·笊離等物、出口貨、主要者爲棉花·小麥·芝蔴·花生·鴨梨·（雪花梨）棗·葡萄·猪·鷄蛋·莊布·柳罐·香油·花生油·眼藥（世稱定州眼藥）等、每年共值三百餘萬元、入口貨、大宗者爲小米·洋麵·高粱·黑豆·大米·媒·媒油·洋火·紙烟·鹽·磁器·洋布·洋綫·油漆·自行車·藥品·裝飾品等、年值二百九十餘萬元、國貨約佔二百四十萬元、餘爲外國貨、</p>
<p>農村經濟、全縣農戶、約計六萬八千家、每年賦稅負担、總計四十餘萬元、農戶有債累者占總數百分之六十七、約四萬六千家、借貸農家中、種地不滿二十畝者占百分之六十三、二十至二十四畝者百分之二十四、四十畝以上者僅百分之十三、借貸利息、普通二分五　、間有高至五分者、因債務積累、家產全被沒收者、年有所聞、乞丐約二千餘人、</p>
<p>學校教育、有省立九中·縣立師範·縣立女師·（職業學校去年停辦）男師附小·女師附中附小·鄉立男高小二十一、女高小二、男初小三百二十二、女初小九十六、民衆學校及平民學校、不下數百處、靑年不識字者占百分之六十二、學齡兒童中失學者占百分之六十、全縣四十萬人中、高小畢業者計六千人、初中畢業者約一千八百人、大學畢業者計四百六十人、衛生方面、全縣醫生合計約四百五十人、平均每村合一人、藥鋪四百餘處、常患之疾病、爲眼·腸·胃·瘡傷·肺癆·小兒抽風·喉·疹·及皮膚病等、近年嗜好白面者日衆、正在嚴禁中、信仰方面、回教徒約七千人、天主教徒約六千人、基督教徒約五百人、一般民衆崇拜偶像、受中等以上教育者、多不信神、廟宇共約千座、風俗方面、俗尙早婚、男多十六歲前娶妻、女多十八歲前出嫁、大半妻長於夫、不滿十六歲之女子、已無緾足者、人民智識高於鄰縣、</p>
<p>據平教會調查結論、認爲、該縣可以代表華北農村社會狀况、愚窮弱私四大病象、顯而易見、大多數人民尙爲文盲、食品營養不足、有病弱狀態、缺乏公共心、須設法培養人民之智識力生產力强健力團結力、否則農村建設沒有基礎」、因此該會近年在定縣實騐工作、有四大教育與三大方式之揭示、誠所謂對症下藥也、</p>
<h3 id="c74">華北問題形勢和緩　商震赴津就職並談調防駐軍 <a href="#c74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>北平通訊、平津因當局維持治安有方、人心尙安、不若外傳之激烈、河北省政府首先由天津移至保定、今日已全部遷畢、河北省黨部亦决定遷保、各科卷宗文件、今日（八日）起、分別裝箱、平漢路局已允撥車輛、第一批檔案今晚卽可起運、省黨部委員、昨日已起程、工作人員如幹事等、三日內可全體卦保辦公、北平市黨部照常辦公、</p>
<p>新任天津警備司令兼代市長商震、自經中央發表任命後、因候中央頒佈警備司令部組織條例、並接洽司令部經費、及調動警備部隊等事、延未就職、述日經各方敦促、津市長張廷諤派代表劉濬明到平速駕、商氏以警備司令部組織條例已頒佈到平、各事在平亦準備就緒、今晨（八日）七時許在南長街私邸接見劉溶明後、九時許赴居仁堂謁軍分會代委員長何應欽、對就職事、有所請示、旋派參謀果仁甫·范哲由·及衛隊長李少白率一部隨從副官衛隊等五十餘人、搭北寗路車先行赴津、下午三時、商氏偕三十二軍部秘書長劉運芳到前門東站、登車赴津到站送行者有鮑毓麟·何其鞏·王卓然·傅章等二十餘人、臨行向記者發表談話如下、天津治安、關係繁重、本人原擬到津後、同時就代市長兼職、並就警備司令職、惟因時間關係將先赴市府、與張市長（廷諤）接洽視事、然後再就警備司令職、警備司令部亦同時成立、五十一軍調防、所有塘沾·大沽·楊柳靑·馬廠各地遺防、均由三十二軍接替、已派定本軍呂宋兩師於二日內陸續開往、本軍軍部暫仍設平、由參謀長傅立平留平、主持一切、津市警察足敷維持治安、市內無需調駐軍隊、本人在津一切布置竣事後、卽返平謁何委員長云、</p>
<p>據關係方面消息、商氏行前、其老友王揖唐已於昨晚（七日）赴津、偕同天津寓公曹汝霖代商氏分向各方接洽、結果順利、故商氏今日赴津、明日到市府視事、並不舉行任何儀式、警備司令部成立期、俟商氏到津後、即可决定、內部組織、在平已完全决定、軍務處長已派定陳子寬、</p>

<h3 id="c75">閩贛　赤匪消滅在卽　偽中委彭祜詳述失敗原因 <a href="#c75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>福州通訊、偽閩贛軍區第十九團及十二團之一部五百餘人月前在仙遊全部被俘、偽政治委員彭祜、於覊押第四區行政專員公署時、曾具狀陳述、閩贛赤匪組織、及失敗原因甚詳、茲特探誌於下，</p>
<p>僞組織之內部情形</p>
<p>閩贛原有組織及其武裝狀况、閩贛軍區原直歸偽軍委會指揮、自國軍進駐長汀瑞金後、在瑞金成立中區、以項英爲偽中區司令員、兼政治委員、賀昌爲偽中區政治部主任、管轄贛南·閩浙·閩北·閩西等六區、因此閩贛亦在偽中央管轄之下、閩贛軍區下之組織、有司令部·政治部·供給部·衛生部、司令員爲現在投誠之團長宋淵泉、政治委員鍾循仁·政治主任爲彭祜供給部長謝吾、衛生部長賀臣科、參謀長徐江漢、閩贛軍區之下、轄三個分區、第一分區原在歸化、國軍五十二師進駐歸化後、一分區取消、司令員爲邱尙聰、政治委員爲溫含珍、二分區在安遠、司令員爲王又成、在石城方面與國軍作戰陣亡、政治委員爲蕭明星、三分區在橫江、司令員未詳、政治委員爲劉邦花、</p>
<p>不能打政治路綫</p>
<p>政治路綫、自國軍節節勝利、共匪日趨消滅之後、偽中央改變路綫、此在去年十二月時所指示、在本年二月份、偽中區被消滅後、無綫電失其聯絡、指示無從指示、無論與任何方面、均無聯絡、因此目前路綫何如、則不得而知閩贛軍區目前所執行路綫、仍根據前偽中區指示、</p>
<p>游擊戰術失期效用</p>
<p>此次投誠之主要點、求執行偽中區指示政治路綫、根本行不通、而適得其反、不但沒有保持自已有生力量、且人員日見减少、僅三個月時間、减少一半、其獨立隊未始不同、卽鄰近各偽軍區、如贛南·閩浙等區、均被消滅、在補充方面、更無來源、採用靈活的游擊戰術、隨時被圍軍襲擊、如閩績被五十二師·七十五師·先後在塘地·沙溪·元溪等處擊潰、此因民衆均已覺悟、無人報告消息、到處等於瞎子一樣、以此看來、所謂舉行全國總的反攻、更屬妄想、誠欺騙語也、（一）物質困難、起源無着、我們此次出來、一個隊僅帶原有存欽一萬元、每人每天發給伙食一角、現已用完、衣服鞋子、均無補充、有時三四天沒有飯吃、（二）人員减少、作戰傷亡、以及病的調隊的數目很大、不講打仗、卽天天行軍、拖也要拖完、况來源無着、（三）民衆覺悟、離開我們每到一處、男婦老幼均沒一個嚮導、無人走路、亦走不通、每天只行軍二十里、有的地方民衆、以武力對付、</p>
<p>欲求生存只有投誠</p>
<p>根據上列實際困難情形、消滅卽在目前、要實行共產主義、尤屬妄想、經過我們再三思索、覺悟悔過自新、向三民主義途路上、爲黨國效勞、爲民衆謀利益、才是出路、此次本來可一致來降的、因偽中委鍾循仁、省肅委會主任陳長淸、省府主席楊道明、出而反對、堅持不來、故只得帶到一個營來、以後當可陸續來歸、此次來的部隊、爲偽十九團及十二團之兩個連、及直屬連一個、連保衛隊一個隊、合共編成兩個營、人數七百餘人、槍四百餘枝、軍區早已取消、卽留閩贛之部隊、亦無統一指揮云、（六月八日）</p>

<p>潘仰堯講、商業承兌票據與工商業、其大意爲（一）工商界目前的困難、不外下列數種、（一）市塲縮小、（二）捐稅繁重、（三）勞資糾紛、（四）帳面難收、（五）資金短少、其中尤以第（一）（四）（五）項、關係工商業生存之命脈、尤爲重要、加以分析、則（一）（四）兩項是因、（五）項是果、試看近來倒閉的工廠商店、莫不由於週轉不靈·存貨堆積·帳過多、實爲致命的打擊、上年美國實施購銀政策、我國存銀出超達二萬六千萬元之多、通貨收縮、銀行把减少放欵充實準備作爲防止恐慌的手段、因此平時工商界命脈所擊的銀行借欵、驟形短少、遂陷於恐慌的深淵之中、（二）工商界資金短絀的最大原因、爲我國放賬制度、不能適應新的經濟界之需要、致大部資金、變爲呆滯的賬面債權、（三）推行商業承兌票據、足以靈動商業的資金、最簡捷的方法、就是設法把虛擱的帳面債權、變爲流通的票據債權、惟有推行商業承兌票據、因爲承兌票據、由售貨商爲出票人、送請買貨商或其代理銀行承兌後、如售貨商臨時需用資金、可向銀行請求貼現、收取現欵、或轉付他人、代替現欵、這樣的輾轉流通、不啻增加市塲上的籌碼、（四）推行商　承兌票據的利益、當年我國金融界的收縮政策旣如此、工商業資金需要的殷切又如彼、在此尖銳的矛盾情形之下、工商界祇有自身努力設法解除這種困難、所以推行商業承兌票據、就是工商界自救的有效工具、承兌票據、經濟學家金融家及政府當局協力鼓吹、希望工商界能開誠奉行、以適應這時代的需要、如能推行盡利、則卽以上海而論、每天生意的成交、不下數千萬元、依據這種生意而開出的承兌票據、就可供應社會以數千萬元的籌碼、我們當還記得、今年一二月間起、工商界遭逢極大的資金缺少的壓迫、於是就有工商業救濟大同盟等團體的組織、聯合向政府社會呼籲、請求金融界照常放欵、閙了數月、勉强允許考慮之信用小借欵五百萬元、直到現在、這區區之數、尙未聞實施貸放分文、足見萬事遇到困難的常兒、要佇待外來的救濟、總是吃力而無實惠的、求人不如求己、工商界如果能下大决心、自圖振作、從本身改良着手、先把數千萬元帳面債權、設法使之流通市面、以人爲的力量、加强承兌票據的信用、那時金融界對於貼現放欵、或者要一變以前吝慳的態度、趨之若鶩惟恐不及了、就此一點、我可以肯定地說、凡是困難的境遇、必須自身先謀應付方策、如果進行順利、那來才能希望外來的恊助、批行承兌票據、就是工商界解决自　　身困難的良途徑、</p>

<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>近日報載紹興鄉民聚衆千餘搗毀周某的家宅，說是周某組織同善社，暗地調查鄉民的姓名年齡生出月日；被調查的人，都要捉去靈魂，捧那剛在動工的錢塘江大橋的橋脚。鐵橋的橋脚，爲什麼定要靈魂去捧？我實在不大明白；不過我只活了三十多年，這類事，已不知見了多少次。民國三年的夏天，浙東一帶起了一個大騷動，卽是所謂「學齡兒童風潮」。那年的春天，各縣都奉令調查學齡兒童；仲夏以後，各處天旱，一連三個月不下雨，收成十分不好。恰巧秋初，歐戰發動，德人相率回國，曹娥江上那條鐵橋的工程，忽而中停．於是謠言起來了，說是那條鐵橋，連洋鬼子也已沒法了，要捉小孩子的靈魂去捧那鐵橋的橋脚；凡是春聞被調查的那些兒童，都在被捉之列。於是大騷動起來了，搗學校，殺調查員，燒縣署，還有所謂愛嬰軍的出現；在家庭方面，花樣更多，請道士，塗狗血，穿七星錢，找洪武通寶，掛黃香袋，應有盡有。接着政府方面的忙碌，派兵，槍斃，殺頭，貼布告，派宣傳員，後來也就無影無蹤安靜下去。民國十八年，南京中山陵正在建築，南京城裏，滿街都是捉魂造陵的謠傳，小孩子們身上又滿繫着黃袋七星錢之類。民國十九年，太湖流域又有捉小學生靈魂捧橋脚的謠傳，嘉湖一帶的小學，竟有全部告假回家的。這回紹興捉靈魂捧橋脚的謠言，也不過是舊戲重排，角色不同，地點不同而巳。這種傳說的起源已很古。唐玄宗開元二十七年，改作明堂。訛言：「官取小兒埋於明堂之下，以爲壓勝。村野兒童，藏於山谷；都城騷然。」足見一千三百年前的傳說，和目前的傳說一模一樣，比開元更早的傳說，則有隋煬帝開運河捉小兒當差的傳說；或許可以找到更早的傳說。</p>
<p>紹與這回捉靈魂的傳說，和以往稍徵有點不同。以往一致只說捉小孩子的靈魂，這回却是婦孺老幼壯弱的靈魂都要被捉、似乎範圍廣闊得多。道家哲學，如老荘都拿嬰兒來比渾然未鑿的天眞，所謂「其神全也」。後來老實人把聰明人的響喻當作實際的事，於是漢朝以來神仙家的修練，都從嬰兒身上着想：山洞裏的妖魔把堂男女當作點心；採補的大也把吃童子一　處女元紅當作藥引：黃帝御九九八十一素女而升天，所以蘇州的老盡師，和道德學社的段師尊到處在找處女，要想湊滿九九八十一的成數；方式或有不同，其理則一也。凡有大制作大建築，非小兒壓勝不能成功，也是同一原理的推演。然而靈魂應用要推廣及於婦孺老幼壯弱，似乎有點摩登化，不大合神仙家的理論。而且紹興人士這樣一提倡，連我們中年人都有點惴惴自危。我總覺得役用靈魂的範圍還是不推廣爲妙！</p>
<h3 id="c142">棉蘭見聞錄 <a href="#c142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— 斐兒</p>
<p>火車將進入棉蘭車站的時候，代表着中國人的信仰的「天后宮便以紅牆尖脊的古老的建築形式第一次映入旅人的眼廉。下車後步行過天后宮，那屋子前面廣理上的古老的銅爐正痼瘟地騰升着姻圈；一個圍着紗籠的年輕的少婦正向香爐上挿上香烟。進入廟里的時候，被香烟薰得灰黑的右方的牆壁上掛着一方銅牌，上面鏤刻着自開闢棉蘭的張氏以下的各位富人所捐題的欽項數目，還有中國領事官的名字。在這的附近，我也看到差不多的建築物的「關帝廟」。那規模的並非粗陋正宣示這里中國人的勢力實是宏大，而這里的神明們也正享着「人」福，連建築物也遠比遍佈各小埠的「伯公宮」和「三保廟」顯得較爲偉大。（自然較新加坡的「三靈寺或檳榔嶼的「極樂寺」遠比不上，那全是受人事所支配的緣故。）</p>
<p>這精神上的駝負正表示着中國人堅忍的美性。（或者同時也正是中國人的劣根性。）恃着神的庇佑，中國人把荒野關成富原，把蠻瘴化爲樂土。也恃着冥冥的神的福庇，棉蘭從客家人張氏的手下關成爲現在的都市，也變成爲蘇島的首府。可惜的是勞力的結果却只爲他人所收穫，而中國人只吃着人家的唾餘。棉蘭旣成爲殖民地都市的典型，而「三保公」與「天后，關帝」，也敵不過「耶穌天主」。神能催促人建築起人間的文化，神可也能保佑他的子民不受外族所欺凌與驅迷？在咱們這個仳界，棉蘭的僑民們可能在排華聲中，從神的迷醉下解放出來，而做人爲的奮鬥？</p>
<p>在棉蘭市中心，中國僑長建起了「瑪腰第」。門前立着石獅子，屋宇也努力模仿帝王時代達官貴人府第的形式。在這資本帝國主義支配下的殖民地，中國人還好好地保留着封建時代的頭腦。一個苦力，一旦由辛勤的勞力而獲得了較高的地位，做成了「番官」，那心中的歡悅和「面子」上的光榮，簡直和以前的「士大夫」階級一樣。白種人利用這弱點，把「瑪腰」和「甲必丹」們置屬於統制之下，帮同殖民地的統治。閩粵間有不少替荷蘭人做嚮導，攻佔士人部落而獲得「番官」的，回鄉後也建起了莊嚴的府第，被稱爲「某某爺」的，那情形正是一樣。</p>
<p>想着吉嚨坡葉來的孫子被迫獻上了版圖，而婆羅洲坤甸王（一個潮州人）因無援而被荷蘭人所擊敗，爪哇泛成了「紅河」，或成羣的墾荒者現在被陸續驅逐回國，那我們又將有什麼感想？</p>

<h3 id="c144">生活 <a href="#c144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— 希雋</p>
<p>年輕季節是有溫馥的夢，也有溆色的憧憬的，可是經過現實的鐵蹄子一踐踏，便即刻粉碎了。</p>
<p>我害怕生活獰猙的嘴臉比害怕鬼魔更甚，它永遠　着足跟踪着我，從沒有片刻離開去，我彷彿聽見它不時打身邊發出冷酷的笑聲，像夜用的鬼啾那麼使人毛孔起粟子。我知道它那樣緊緊逍趕着，是想瞅住我於一千回的留神中有一回疏忽，它便撲上來，把我當口點心似的吞下去。</p>
<p>在那樣一個陰險無情的生活的睥睨之下，我無言地低下首，挺起胸脯，有如一匹駱駝，一輛車子，掮負着千斤重的重荷，讓它的皮鞭不停地抽打着，驅使着，在迷茫的無窮盡的長途上行着，不分日，不分夜，從今天到明天，永恒的蹣跚向前，流着汗，喘着氣。我不容易瞧太陽的光，因爲在白天，空間也還是瀰漫着厚厚的　霧；夜里，天上沒有月，也沒有星子，只有凄厲的風在呼嘯着，而包圍在身外的却是一層層的黑影，在冲不開的黑影中我　匐着，因爲找巳經够累了。</p>
<p>然而生活並不會因此對於我表示一點憫憐，它的皮鞭繼續不放鬆地飛揚起來，如果脚歩稍爲遲滯下來，它便馬上重重笞撻着，逼迫我趕路。於是我無言地，一句話沒有，咬着押根冉走着，一邊聽憑它無厭的蹂躪，這樣，我的脖子漸漸　下來，胸脯也拘儘着，再挺不起來了。</p>
<p>「生活能够給我什麼呢？」找被　折得幾乎連感覺也失掉了，我帶着歇斯迭里的口氣膽怯地向着可怕的生活問着，它只管綳着鐵靑的臉，陰冷地笑着，並不理　找。而一邊它又揚起皮鞭來。</p>
<p>誰說生活的上邊鐵着藍的色彩，燦爛的圖繪，我不相信，這些美麗的綫條從來不會在我的眼底浮出來，我也從來不曾長着這念頭。我唯知道生活祇是給以無邊的，摧難和苦楚，使我長久做它的牛馬，天天磨折着，直到最後一口氣的時候爲止。我也想過攅一攅勁兒，衝過去揪住它打一頓，反抗它無理的壓迫，沒奈我的腿子巳勞碌到發麻，手膀也痙攀着，力氣更不消說得了。於是我往往在不能人睡的深夜，發狂以的抓着頭髮，使勁搥着胸膛，慘苦的嚷着：「你也得讓我休息一下吧，我巳快要動彈不得了」。但是生活依然不理睬找，它的嘴角上老是掛了個獰惡的冷笑，而到了明天，它便揚起鞭子，摧殘着我了。</p>
<h3 id="c145">一個人的死（上） <a href="#c145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— 黑嬰</p>
<p>店里那個高瘦的，聳起兩隻筆架似的肩膀的裁縫師務有一天病倒了。「你去休養一下吧！」老板發號令一般地站在他的面前，擺着拙笨的八字脚，這這樣地說。。於是病人就透過一口氣來，收拾起零星的布屑和剪刀，針棧之類拖着迂緩的，鴨子樣的脚步一擺一擺地向樓上跨去。瞧着他那消沒於那跟太陽光從不發生緣分的房間里的背影，我木維樣地站在樓梯口想起他沒有幾天以前對我偶然說起的話。」</p>
<p>「小鬼！你站着的時候就像一頭牛那樣的强壯呀！」露出一股羨慕的神情，他的眼晴釘着我的身體。「你是不會生病的。我却不對啦。……你不生病自然不會懂得那難受的刑罰；眞受不了啊。……而且人類都是寡情的，勢利動物；有錢的持候你受着一點寒，傷風了，就有人問你身體舒服不舒服？要不要吃藥？窮人麼，鬼才關心到你！人家會讓你躱在房間里，看也不來看你一下，除了你給閻羅王捉去了，他們才若無其事地給你準備副棺材。……這樣的世界找實在看得太多了！」</p>
<p>他的樣子顯得憂鬱。自從前幾偭月生病，跟他住在一起的爪哇婆扔棄他走了之後，他的病實際上並沒有好過。只是不作工便沒有飯吃，不能不掙扎起來，仍舊坐在勝家牌衣車面前，兩隻無力的脚踏着車盤做着工。現在他又倒下去了。</p>
<p>是的，窮人最好是强壯一些，不然生了病是沒有人理睬的。那天晚上我關好店門，把電燈全熄滅了以後，躡着輕捷的脚步到他的房間里來。我想大概睡着了也說不定；但是床前一張長方形桌上的臘燭火還螢螢地照着，還聽到斷續地呻吟聲從那黃色的帳子里送到我的耳膜邊。</p>
<p>「老方」我低聲地叫着。</p>
<p>「咿：你麼」？他翻轉身，沒神的眼光射到我的的臉上。我側身坐在床板邊，替他蓋好了氈子。</p>
<p>「病了…你要不要買點什麼藥吃？咦，你還沒有吃飯呢，要不要……」</p>
<p>「我的胃口不好，不要。…你給我看看那抽　里邊的八掛丹還有沒有。」他指着那張桌子。</p>
<p>我給他找出了一包八掛丹，遞給他，還到了一杯開水。外面是靜寂的荒埤頭的五月之夜，風吹着，椰子樹葉沙沙地響着。我站在凳子上把對床的一扇窗門關上了。在那裏陪伴着病人，我打起瞌睡來了。「你睡覺去吧，我也想靜一靜！」他這樣對我說，閉上了眼皮。我給他放好帳，吹熄燭光，回到三層樓的角落裏去。</p>
<p>一天，二天，……裁縫師的病並不見起色，呻吟的聲音漸漸地沉重，使人不忍聽下去。我每天都有幾次來看他，給他送稀飯，買藥，開窗或者掃地。有的時候他向我訴苦，但後來却有氣沒力地躺在床上，眼睛直釘着帳頂，話也懶得說了。老板娘老是抓住我問着病人的消息，自家却遠遠地避開他。她的麻臉甚至現出厭恨的光彩，似乎恨不得高聲地喊出來：「眞倒霉呀，二樓我的房間後面住着病鬼，他天天呻吟着，閻羅王拖着他似的，嘈得人家睡不着覺。……他如果死在我們店裏怎麼辦呢」？然而她沒有膽量喊出她的心事。來回地在廚房裏踱來踱去，嘴裏喃喃着：「怎麼辦」？我一邊洗着米預備煮飯，一邊偷偷地睢着這女人的神氣。最後她忽然自言自語地說道：「爲什麼不進醫院？」</p>
<p>「醫院？我們這裏沒有醫院的呀」！我挿嘴道。</p>
<p>「送到牙冷的醫院去」。她說。</p>

<p>— 周楞伽</p>
<p>巽卿先生這時的表情是很難形容出來的，他從面孔紅起一直紅到耳根，右邊頰上本來發紅的那一塊地方這時更紅中透亮。突然，他暴跳如雷的直衝到那少婦面前去說：</p>
<p>「你放屁！你大放其不可響邇的黃狼屁！你把我金巽卿當什麼人？我……金巽卿……從前的候補縣議員，現在地方上有名的紳士，會來調戲你這種一錢不值的賤貨嗎？你這樣公然毀謗，還當了得！——我猜你一定是給强盜摸了奶，鬼迷了頭，纏到我身上來了」。</p>
<p>那少婦被逼得退到座位上去，經續她柔弱而無力的啜泣，不敢再開口。巽卿先生佔着了上風，分外肆出他的威燄來了，整個船艙裏，幾乎充滿了他一人的大而嗄的聲音。</p>
<p>「哼哼！你也不認認我金巽卿是誰，居然敢到太歲頭上來動土，我可不能饒過你！你知道嗎？你巳經犯了罪了。刑法上有一條罪名，叫公然毀謗罪，就是你現在所犯的。我也不同你多說什麼，只根據刑法第……第……總之是刑法上的一條，請你吃現成官司。——喂喂！船家長」！</p>
<p>「做什麼？」船家長沒精打彩的在船梢頭問。</p>
<p>「替我拿一根長長的蔴繩來。」</p>
<p>「嘎！這可沒有。」</p>
<p>柳滄水這時巳經完全明瞭了內幕，他　有些爲那少婦不平，忍不往挺身出來，向巽卿先生說：</p>
<p>「巽卿先生，算了罷。得放乎時且放手，得饒人處且饒人。」</p>
<p>「不行！名譽是一個人的第二生命，她是不是强盜的底底我不管，可是她毀謗我名譽却容她不得！」</p>
<p>吳鶴軒似乎也有些看不過巽卿先生那跋扈的樣子了。他用比巽卿先生更大的聲音喊船家長。</p>
<p>「喂！船家長，船開到哪見了？」</p>
<p>「前面就是楊家壩。」</p>
<p>「好！就停在楊家　過夜。」</p>
<p>他這一句話，差不多可以代表全船一致的意見，因爲艙中人沒有一個表示異議的。</p>
<p>一個大的沉默籠罩了整個船艙，在這沉默之中，只有那少婦的嚶嚶啜泣聲細微地發出着。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c147">敎部視察　魯省職敎報告 <a href="#c147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>敎部視察山東省職業敎育、報告摘要如下、該省省立職業敎育機關、在十八年度共有七校、十九年度合倂裁撤結果爲三校、至二十二年度添設陽穀染織職業學校、共有四校、原定二十三年度、添設博山陶瓷職業學校、二十四年度添設濰縣染織職業學校及嶧縣礦科職業學校、二十五年度添設煙台水產職業學校及濟南畜牧園藝職業學校、二十六年度添設臨清農科職業學校、及濟南土木職業學校、預計四年之中添設七校、謂本年度並未成立陶瓷職業學校、查該省中等敎育經費之支配去部定標準甚遠、即令該省原定之計劃全部實現、到十十六年度職業敎育經費、亦只佔百分之十八、今并此計劃亦未準期實施、殊爲可惜、最近該省舉行中等學校校長會議、該廳曾提出擴充職業敎育方案、擬將各縣師範講習所逐漸停辦、籌設聯立職業學校、嗣又以中等學校行政會議名義建議省府施行求生政治、擬定實業建設計劃及職業敎育設施種類、該案列入最近正在審核之該省三年計劃中、究竟能否實現、不得而知、茲就視察所及、舉其應注意之點如左、</p>
<p>一、該小物產豐富、職業敎育之推行、不宜稍緩、最近擬定之三年實業建設計劃、關於技術人員之培養、計有十校、其設科種類、多與該省原定之職教推行方案相同、應即確定方針、迅速實行、毋稍延宕、師資訓練、亦宜預爲準備、</p>
<p>二、各校生產數量、只等於材料費之半數、如四千元材料只能有二千元之成品可以出售、其餘全屬消耗、亟應改善、</p>
<p>三、該省職業學校經費、尚未依照規定標準提高、致學校購置經費、非常缺乏、常動用每年積餘之售品項下欵項、如欲實行假期作業、集中生產、則大宗材料即無從出、應即設法提高、</p>
<p>四、省立濟南初級工業職業學校辦理尚有成績、惟出品不多、技術欠精、致銷售之數量甚少、應實行假期實習、應化科製作之胰燭等品、因市上貨物充斥、幾無銷路、應注重油漆油墨臘紙皮革等製造、皮件成品欠佳、亟須改良、附設之染織速成班、招收小學畢業及年長失學者、一年畢業、專重技術、尚有成效、應繼續辦理、並應改稱職業補習班、</p>
<p>五、省立濟南女子初級染織蠶絲職業學校染織設備尚佳、容量亦大、惟所製織品、質多單薄、而不耐用、產量亦少、應於二在年級暑假期內實行集中練習、以求技能之嫺熟、蠶絲科設備簡單、毫無新式機械、成績平常、最近該省建設廳正在擴充蠶種試騐塲、需人頗多、應充實敎學內容、力謀改進、附設三年級出數學生、志圖升學、不肯注意實習、對於其他學生影響甚鉅、應嚴予糾正、其有希望升學者、除照常作業外、准予課餘補修、</p>
<p>六、省立濟寗初級工業職業學校之染織成績尚佳、惜產量不多、應多加練習、慶化設備簡陋、亟須添置、所製成品如皮革油漆等亦嫌粗劣、一般學生尚肯勤於操作、訓練班之招生及訓練辦法與上述兩校同、應改稱職業補習班、並繼續辦理、</p>
<p>七、歷城縣立初工業職業學校完全由縣集資籌設、分應化機械兩科、設備尚有基礎、辦理亦合規定、現有四班、勉敷應用、將來班次增加時、須繼續充實、每年經常費迄辦理六班時可增至一萬九千餘元、惟材料費每班每月不及三十元、殊覺困難、致一切練習所需之費、多由敎員認購所製成品、湊集資本、購買原料實非長久之計、應由廳逐年酌予補助、以資維持而謀進展、該校招生名額規定歷城須佔半數、餘招外籍學生如遇歷城縣不能招足時、亦不准以外籍學生頂袖、現全數學生只八十餘人、殆由於此、殊不經濟、應即令縣變通辦法、規定歷城縣籍有優先權、但如本縣名額不足時、准補外籍、以便充實學額、又該鷴學生間有年齡過輕、體力不強、工作稍感困難、應設法調劑、</p>
<p>八、私立惠魯工商學校校舍整潔合用、敎學尚稱認眞、惟初給班敎育設施、以升入本校高級班爲目的、普通學科幾佔全部敎學三分之二、殊有未合、應增加商業訓練、使初給成一階段、俾經濟困難之學生得有謀生機會、其志願升入高級者亦可斟酌情形、縮短一年、與招收初中學生不同、該校尚未立案、應速辦理、校名亦應更改商業職業學校不得混稱工商職業學校、</p>
<p>九、私立惠商職業學校、設備異常缺乏、辦理亦不合法、各科敎學方法與精神、均欠妥善、附設之商業師範科、揆其實際、完全預備普通小學師資、尤爲不合、應即限期改進、否則令其停辦、</p>
<p>十、省立民衆實騐學校、設染織印刷應化刺繡四組、除染織外、均嫌簡陋、分上下午輪流上課、以三分之二時間爲民衆敎育、三分之一時間爲職業訓練、據說學生多能用其所學、以謀生活、似應充實設備、改辦職業補習學校、以符名實、</p>
<p>十一、敎產業廳設立理化儀器生物標本製造所、專爲預備小學全部及初中一部分之儀器標本而設、廉價出售、以謀中小學敎育之改進、用意甚足、查該省年來小學數量激增、內容正須改善、該廳設立是項製製機關、充實科學設備、實爲刻不容緩之舉、惟工具尚未完備、出品亦欠精細、應令主持人員多到各地之理科儀器及標本製製機關詳細研究、力謀改進、將來辦理有成效時、可擴充內容、注意於中小學勞作科標準工具之製造、以謀勞作敎育之改進、</p>
<p>十二、山東大學農學院、年來從事於芋苗之施肥、犁種棉種及病蟲害等之研究、頗著成績、並爲推廣研究結果起見、分別就耒陽歷城等區域、舉辦講習班、招收青年農民予以有用之農業補習敎育、亦有成效、惟因經濟困難、不能擴大設施、可就專實需要、酌予補助、以資推廣、又最近該大學與三省立鄉師合作、充實農業學科之內容、辦法甚是、亦應加緊推行、</p>

<p>增設高欄中欄等五新項目</p>
<p>——破紀錄四百千五等四項</p>
<p>上海市田徑競技促進會主辦之二屆聯合運動會、前因大雨流產、直至昨日下午二時、仍在申園運動塲舉行、昨日雖已炎夏天氣、下午密雲不雨、雖有時驕陽直射、但不久即躲入雲中、直予運動員以無上機會、惟四座年者、甚屬寥寥、或以夏日可畏、而裹足不前歟、大會至二時三十七分、方正式開始運動、新紀錄亦收獲不少、用將詳情分誌如下、</p>
<p>徑賽素描</p>
<p>（短距離）百公尺黃飛龍不愧能手、五十公尺後、但見黃一馬領先、趨塵絕馳、白綫衝破、領先達一以尺有餘、撐竿大哥符保羅昨亦倒串此項、爲白虹隊效力、足見白虹隊短距離能手、盡在外埠、蜀中無大將、廖化作先鋒矣、乙組中以陳君若領袖尋倫、不愧佼傑、此君面貌甚熟、事後探聽、原來即是陳永福之化名、二百公尺黃飛龍跑前呼聲極高、結果竟非此君莫屬、乙組之乎福昌、曾在民衆業餘運動會一獻身手、昨亦點得鰲頭、健將葉嵩平、昨日挾其釘鞋、徜徉碧草坪中、結果竟未下塲、否則當有更好成績供獻也、</p>
<p>（中距離）中距離能手賈連仁、昨以腳痛未下塲、大貓孫惠培昨串四百公尺、當然無人敵手、且造大會新紀錄、乙組中瞿炳輝實力與老賈一樣、終點計時、且超過大貓卻卻一秒正、殊屬難能、八百公尺一項、甲乙兩組倂合舉行、結果乙組中之樂俊昌、辜秉後兩人、竟先甲組傅元祥到達、成績亦快二秒又二、</p>
<p>（畏距離）千五百公尺、亦甲乙倂合、楊慶燮昨日風頭甚健、以三公尺之並非、拋落萬人矚目之王天林、殊不知王正林在五千及萬公尺兩項、洵無哩失敗於英將白朗、亦即此因、固非戰之罪也、乙組周志成、前在全市及蘇州公共體育塲曾獻身手、昨日跑來、亦甚出色、萬公尺一項、昨臨時改爲五千、王正林當然無人爭雄、惟因天氣炎熱、成績未見優異、乙組凌學文、姿勢美觀、實力充足、亦可兒也、</p>
<p>（兩欄賽）陳嘉佑腿傷新愈、第二欄時即以飛鳥掠水、腳頭夾脆、不惚草上飛燕、別來三日、又當括目矣、乙組汪津生成績、亦屬不弱、中欄一項、大貓領袖羣雄、惟操之過急、致中途連倒兩欄、終以八公尺領先、乙組抵奚竹漪一人起步、孫志腫陪同表演一週、</p>
<p>田賽詳情</p>

<p>（三跳）跳遠王禾起跳僅六公尺四〇、至第三次始造成六公尺五六、乙組霍鉅康一躍後、即無人與競、跳高一項、甲組許文奎、成績甚佳、乙組黃家序、亦屬不惡、三級跳原爲王禾拿手好戲、張家夔而外、當推此君、蔣懷仁苦於短視、當非王之敵手、乙組之黃家序則成績平平而乙、各組詳細成績分誌於次、</p>

<p>（撐竿）撐竿大王符保盧、昨日客串百公尺及鐵餅後、竟一籌莫展、失敗於王魏兩人之下、嗣後爲恢復其英名起見、雖曾跳過三公尺四三、但僅作表演矣、王禾日來成績狂晉、惟昨日王在三級跳後、成績未免減色、乙組三人成績相並、惟周宋較先跳遠、並佔第一、</p>

<h3 id="c166">發行物品證券意見之商榷 <a href="#c166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— 王雨桐</p>
<p>一國經濟之安定，必賴有健全之通貨政策，我國年來之經濟情形，幾全受不健全之通貨政策所影響而混亂。按銀之為物，在我國為惟一之本位貨幣，而在各國視為一種商品而已。以是當　年金貴銀賤風潮時，我經濟界竟被其他嚴重之影響，又復予銀本位以深重之痛苦。美國之提高銀價，其原意在使世界的銀價，普遍的提高，庶金價低落，物價獲得循序洪漸進之向上。而其惟一目的，尤注意於增進銀本位國家之購買力，以圖本國對外貿易之進展。但結果則未必與其所希冀者相副，銀價固已見世界的普遍之提高，而於銀本位國家購買力之增進一點，自金本位國家立場上觀之，在理論上雖可加以肯定，然實際上適得其反，如今日中國正因銀之漲價，使通貨價值提高，直接促成物價下落，經濟不景氣，購買力衰沉，凡此皆為其實證也。尤以最近中國存銀，被美購銀政策所誘惑，大量外流，是通貨緊縮之愈成深刻化，乃屬當然之結果。此類購銀政策之施行，徒貽害於中國之貨幣制度，損人而不利己，吾不知美政府　何取乎提高銀價政策。故論者咸以為中國採用銀本位貨幣，在今日已不合時代。但甘末爾氏所提倡之金匯兌本位制，實現亦覺。又各種紙幣本位，在中國亦無實行之望，結果中國之貨幣制度，仍不能不置其基礎於金屬，先進國中亦有以三成之金準備，即能維持金本位者，今後中國果有健全之銀行，統一紙幣，維持信用，則銀本位制度，仍可繼續。惟吾人就目前之情勢以言，彼購銀政策之施行，依然如故，迄未稍有改變，且更變本加厲。而一方我國今日欲　圖整理幣制，以保持銀本位，則又非里旦夕間所可一蹴而就者，因是年來我國經濟界人士，有主張供貨幣革命之說者頗盛。　徐青甫先生於所著一經濟革命救國論二書，極力主張徹底進行，理想透徹，條理緻密，頗有獨到之處。嗣閻百川先生有發行物產證券之講話，且在晉省忻縣五台各處已試辦農村信用合作券。最近復獲誠徐青甫先生所著「發行物品證券之意見」一文，徐氏痛感於我國之生產落後，國際貿易處於入超地位，而銀為我國貨幣之原料，素仰外求，徒增加入超之數額，故主發行物品證券，復可使貨幣充裕，一方面將貨幣與物價達連鎖關係，不因貨幣數量之增加，而致物價騰貴，以期生產加多，實際分配之效用加增，消費物量增進，達到經濟改善之目的。青甫先生為國內之經濟學家，吾黨之傑者，近承其惠寄大著，往復循育，欽佩再四，惟尚有數點，挺與青甫先生一加商榷焉。</p>
<p>物品證券之發行，必須事先作大規模之全國物產調查與統計，就全國之物產，於其生產情形，供求關係，價值之高下，須先有精密之測量統計，加以各種物產之運輸及交易之手續不同，復有時令地域之　隔，品質隨氣候時節而起變化等，在在皆宜顧慮周祥。第二物品證券制之實行，對於中上階級之經濟生活，均將起重大之變化，彼等素習於精細物產品之消費，易言之大都以舶來品為主，今物品證券所代表之物品，均為本國自制物品；普镥於一般民眾，實行物品證券制度，即所以制止中上階級之優越經濟生活，降低其物質上之享受，而強令附和於普遍之經濟生活，此在中國今日複雜之經濟情形下，果能推行無陰與否，殊不敢必。徐氏復謂「我們所需的外國貨，除掉地裏蘊藏有限的，以及天時地理關係，特產的物品之外，大都可以仿造。……如果行了物品證券制，他就可以安心產造，現在沒有的產品，自己亦能產出，可以無須依賴外人。」此固為吾人所欲企求之者。然按之實際，我國今日物質進步，既不如人，科學技術亦均落後，普通之外貨尚勉可仿製，其精細而具有專門性質者，則於技術原料等，皆成種種問題，倘仍師昔日之故智，向國外購買原料，或部分製成品及聘請外人技師，從專仿製，則原料之貨欵，及外人拔師之薪給支付，均與幣制有密切之關係。況在中國今日整個民族經濟情形瀕危之下，已不能再容此類仿製工業之存在。又關於物質之享受，亦應顧及時代性遞展之重要，換言之，即時代係永續前進無已，人類之物質欲望，亦隨之日有進步，其為效小則足以助人類之智能技巧日精，大則可令事業發揚光大，是人數既能隨時代之轉換而生存，亦必需合乎時代之物質享受以副之，物質文明誠足搆成民族生存之要素，故施行物品證券制之始，不宜過分壓制一般之物質慾望，否則削足適履，利未簽名簿而害已隨之。不佞之作此言，非好為享受優越生活之中上階級張目，實亦有感於經濟政策之施行，宜力求避免有背於經濟原則之行為也。</p>
<p>徐氏謂「施行物品證券制，我們一定是把各生產部門統制起來，」此誠為扼要之點，按產業統制之範圍極大，吾人姑就關於商品產銷統制，所不可不知者，計分數點如下列：</p>
<p>一·關於商品生產上之統制　（甲）品質統制，（乙）種質統制，（丙）規格統制，</p>
<p>二·關於價格及販賣之統制　（甲）價格統制，（乙）售價比率統制，</p>
<p>三·關於生產量及供求統制　（甲）生產數量之統制，（乙）運輸數量之統制，</p>
<p>四·關於原料採購之統制，</p>
<p>故於產業，統制立法，茍失之粗疏，則統制之效果既不能見，而對於整個物品證券制度，將有極大之影響，此不可不注意者也。上所論列，不過就鄙見略抒一二，他日有會，頗擬與青甫先生作詳細之討論，藉以請益也。——二十四年五月二十二日於北平</p>
<h3 id="c167">河北定縣農村之改進 <a href="#c167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— 魯紹柳</p>
<p>定縣是河北省縣政建設研究院特畫出的實騐縣，縣內一切的事業—農村經濟方面，經各專家的努力研究，積極實施，現在確已有不少的事業，正在努力向前開步走，因此更掀動了中外人士的觀摩興趣，數年來參觀者已不下數百起。茲將定縣農村最近之大概情形，略述於左，以　關心及研究農村問題之參考；</p>
<p>土地面積共三，六五〇方里，現已開墾之農田，據民國二十三年平教會調查為一百六十萬畝，按全縣有四十萬眾多的人口來分配，平均每個人只得四畝。較之英國農民每人須有一五畝田地，始能維持生活；及美國每人須有地一六.〇九畝才能收支相抵。各規定，所差之數目，委實驚人！所以定縣農民過去生活上感覺困難之內在，是「人多地少二產糧不足分配」等要素，然而居然能夠很泰平的生存到如今，其生活程度之低下，亦可想見了。近來縣內農民　井專業，異常發達，（據今年民政廳找張厚琬視察結果全縣共餘六萬餘口，見五月二十七日大公報）使農民增加了不少的生產，所以每年有在量的農產物，由平漢鐵路向外輸出。</p>
<p>縣境無高山大川，原田每每，一望無垠，土地之肥沃，頗宜耕耘，各村以環境相同關係，所有農田，悉賴井泉灌溉，（據平教會二十三年度調查共五萬眼，據最近冀民廳長張存琬視察全縣共有井六萬口，載大公報五月二十七日）即偶而終年不雨，農民亦能照常播植種，所以俗有「旱不死的定縣，滿不的曲陽」之說。井分轆轤井水車井兩耘，水車井以擊掘困難，故為數較少，約佔四分之一，水車多藉牲畜之力戽水轆轤，如悉賴人力搖轉，水車井較轆轤井水力大兩倍，平常每轆轤能澆二畝，而水車則可澆農田七八畝，如遇旱天，每井可輪流澆田　一畝，近春華北水委會及中　，河北，金坡各大銀行分別舉辦井資欵，按八厘收息三年償還，聞已有多數農民實有貸欵擊井，將來井數增加，農產物必大量激增，而「人多地少」的定縣農民，如不遇意外天災人禍，食糧問題決沒有困難了。刻平教會生計教育部所發明之自動抽水機，亦試騐成功，計每機每日可溉田四畝，中貫鎖練，上置長柄，一經搖動其鎖練，即循環動轉，水遂由鎖練之空際，向上噴出，其機件運動之輕便，以十四五歲之兒童，即可搖動，較普通水車或轆轤，均為省力，且所抽之水量，亦較水車為多，現在已有四架分別運往不落崗，建陽縣村幫助農民灌田將來如能大量推廣，亦定縣農民之福音也！</p>
<p>全縣共分五區，有大小村莊共四百七十二，農民生活方式大致相同，除四區高家莊一帶類似曲邑外，其餘全是按照極簡單的方式，布衣蔬食，融融自樂：在本著「日出而作，日入而息」的老規矩條件下，雖汗流夾背，胼手胝足，亦不以為苦，以全年田畝收獲之多寡，定其通年生活經常之費用；如仍有不敷，則必設法另操副業或謀其他工作以為補救。日常食品以小米為主，蔬菜副之，非富有之家輕易不肯食麥麪，平常多為三餐，惟一屆冬暇，則只作兩餐，所儲餘之糧食，多備來年農忙時食用，且兩餐者十之八九只煮白薯、山芋、數塊，渴白水而食者，其生活程度之低實為可憐。而其儉模之習尚，殊為定縣農民特有之美德。衣服更為質撲，多為自家婦女所紡織之紫花色土布，每做一套衣服，非穿至破爛不堪補無可補時，輕易是不肯更換。雖城內婦女近來受新潮流之染化，服飾多尚時髦，且多購買洋貨，據最近調查婦女妝飾品輸入額全年在十八萬元以上。婦女纏足者，走遍街巷，輕易找不到一個（二十歲以下的女子）。住居房屋多為平頂，悉以磚石土坯壘砌而成，牆壁異常堅固，每室必有一土坑，普通五口之家多有四五間房，亦不為擁擠，惟開窗甚少，空氣不易流通，且光線多黑暗，頗不合衛生之道。農民以春秋及麥熟時較為迫然而為生活所迫，就怎樣的忙到什麼程度，也是極樂意。間有除了收割自己的禾稼外，抽暇還要拾撿別人田裏所遺失的禾穗。平常婦女　十之八九是要到田裏幫助田的工作，較比他縣以女人到田間為羞恥之事，實在令人讚美，所以地間大多數婦女都可以搖轆轤灌田，拿鋤把鏟地。民性之精直，素甲於華北，故有健訟之風，輒以極不值得之細故，而累年　訟，以之傾家破產者比比皆是，據說現在在縣內打官司者（訴訟）幾無村無之，且一村甚有不止一兩案者，前縣長霍六丁曾出告示勸農民罷訴文內有一定縣人，性子急，一天官司十六起……一可為明證矣。據說，每年訴訟費用消耗總在八十萬元以上（上訴者在內），這樣驚人官司費用，實在是形成農村經濟破產的一個大原因。</p>
<p>本縣土地價值以受經濟破產之波及，年來竟一落千丈。在前四五年每畝值百元的土地，現在減至二三十元亦無人過問，以致農民變賣無術，故負責之家，宣告破產者即城西百戶之小村莊一年內竟有八家之多。前縣長霍六丁為應付此種困難，曾通令各村農民組織債務調解委員會，自行清理，然亦不甚生效果。幸而今春中國，金城，河北各大銀行實行貸欵，計總額共八十萬元，農村受此巨量潤澤，經濟方面，始略現活躍，近來縣府又急謀推廣合作社之組織，由農民自行加入，凡有關農民生計事宜，悉以合作社為中心點，舉辦合作貸欵，合作購買，合作運銷，將來如收成效，農民獲益定匪淺鮮。農村出產，麥，穀，稻及豆類皆為大量產物，玉蜀黍及高粱次之。據平教會民國二十三年總調查，穀全年產額為六百十一萬公斗，麥全年產額為四百三十四萬公斗，除大量為農民食用外，輸出額尚達三十萬元。近來棉花，落花生產量驟增，去年棉花產額竟達七百八十萬公斗，較前年多一倍以上。落花生竟達八萬萬公斤，較前年增三分之二，多由平津巨商購買，運銷國內外各地，此外白菜鴨梨亦為特產之品，全年產額亦不下一百萬元。近來平教會生計部試種之「抗旱穀」已實騐成功，該穀具有天然抗旱能力，較其他穀省水二分之一，現已則村合作社繼續試種，將來如能推廣，農民食糧定可大增，亦民食之大幸也。農村副業，現時以手工業及養豬淋鹽者為最多，手工業以織布制粉條為最發達，即於農事最忙時亦不停止，計布疋全年產額為三百萬元（平教會調查），其材料概為農民自種之棉花，製法均係手工，每布一疋除工本外，尚可獲利一角，除農民穿用外，多由張家口一帶布販售買，由駝鹽運往西北銷售，全年輸出額為二十萬元。粉條全年產額達五百萬公斤，除本縣食用外多由大車運往深澤安國等縣，轉銷於大清河子牙河及葡萄河流域。但多為山芋粉，其製法係將山芋搗爛，用石磨壓碎，置木羅內淘取其粉，使成漿糊漏於開水鍋內取出即成。以域西南區一帶村莊為最多，最多者幾佔五分之四，為農民之唯一副業，惜多用手工，墨守舊法，不知改良。現在縣政六大建設，生產作主要部份，負責者急應設法改良，利用機器，以增進生產，不獨有關農民生計，而於吾人日常必需之粉條食品衛生上亦有大裨益也。農民以業粉房故，差不多十之八九是養豬的，平常隨便走到任何村莊，隨便可看到三五成羣的豬（回民村莊除外），因為養豬不但可以得到很高的代價，並且可藉豬而得到許多農田需要的肥料，將粉條所餘之渣滓飼之，沃以粉湯，而豬的長在也很快，迨豬飼肥之後，普通每衹可賣洋十元。除本縣食用　　外，多由本地商人購買運往平津銷售，俗調「走京豬」，計每豬可賺洋五角，每年輸出額約十五萬元。近來平教會農場「波支雜種豬」試騐成功，力謀推廣，各村農民，爭相購買，但他以體格很大發達的亦快，必須有大量飼料，才能養到好處。</p>
<p>本縣人口過剩，謀生困難，是極嚴重的事實，於是一般有志的男子（他們不一定有農田），多相繼向外發飛黃騰達　，但以到東北三省去的較多，故有「下關東」之口號，或經營商販，或開墾作工，每到秋後即相聚而返，總計每年總有五六萬人，他們辛苦的代價平常是在八十元上下。到九一八事變，國難嚴重，農民不能前往，無形中使定縣增加了許多喫飯的無業農民，亦為農村崩潰的一個大原因。至二十三年春被漢奸私自委任者，據平教會調查，為數仍不下二萬人，然多為工頭所騙，至今尚有多家起訴者。</p>
<p>本縣農民為生活所迫無錢購買食鹽，又月少數土地以地質味鹹關係，所以有許多村莊農民掃土淋鹽，就成其唯一生路了。如第一區沿沙河北岸一帶，二區東北部，三區南部，四區西北部，五區西部，約六十餘村，悉有私設鹽鍋淋鹽者，平均括土百斤，可淋鹽水兩擔，晒鹽二十斤，硝八斤，按一在價目鹽可值價一元，而硝價高過十倍，可值三四元，故括土自斤，總計可得五元之代價，較種植禾稼收穫，遠勝十倍，故此該村等農民為維持生活，寗肯犧牲種植，雖經駐定緝私大隊迭為罰辦，亦非私淋不可。</p>
<p>此外毒品流行與苛捐雜稅之重重剝削，亦是農村不景氣的大原因。據熟悉縣內情形者談，各村吸食白面及販賣者，幾無村無之，而以城內尤甚，計全年消耗量約在百萬元以上（前年霍六丁接縣時調查數目），如此駭人聽聞之巨額，實為農村破產的一個主要原因。定縣的田賦，除正額外附加捐稅返超過二倍以上，平均每人幾擔負一元之多，值此民不聊生之際，農村破產的當兒，廢除苛雜實為正當要著，日前河北捐稅監理會已函請將定縣第一期應廢除苛雜共計九千六百一十元，雖為數無多，如能實行，亦可稍蘇民困。</p>
<p>以上將定縣農村現在情形過去狀況及崩潰原因，無系統的隨便寫來，實在貽笑大方。但是定縣是實騐縣，且其大概情形，很能作華北一帶的代表，一切的一切五殊值吾人研究，以此不揣簡陋，草擬此文，以便拋磚引玉。</p>
<h3 id="c168">通貨問題的趨嚮（續完） <a href="#c168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— 甘詞森</p>
<p>—兼論法郎的前途—</p>
<p>二，外匯限制（Exchange　Restriclion）——對於外匯成交之自由，加以限制或壓迫的方法，分五種：甲，限制資本的移動——在自由資本的市場中，國際資本的移動，毫無阻礙；但在管理通貨制之下，則有種種方法，以拘束資本之移動：（一）限制外匯的購買，（二）限制外國有價證券的購買，（三）限制生金銀，本國及外國紙幣的輸出。乙，限制投機，有三方面：（一）限制國人購買外匯，（二）限制國人為外人買賣現貨及期貨外匯，（三）限制國人以國幣之信用貸與外人。丙，限制國人之持藏外幣，有二法：（一）強制國人交出因輸出而得之外幣，（二）強制國人交出在國外之銀行存欵及有價證券。丁，限制對外債務之償付，亦有三法：（一）停止欠外信用之轉移，（二）截留欠外信用於國內，（三）限制輸入商之購買外幣。</p>
<p>三，金政策（Gold　Policy）——各國常態下的金政策為對黃金之收買，以其因準備的充實，而使幣值獲得穩定。如日本之金保有法案，金買入政策，以及美國對於生金銀之購買及獎勵其生產都是。而在非常的時候，則用下列方法處置：甲，以課稅平準現金輸送點，乙，變更公定買入價格，丙降低金平價。</p>
<p>四，外匯清算（Exchange　Clearing　System）——這種制度就是國際債權債務可以不經外匯手續而了結。其法乃通常事國中央銀行，以各該國本國貨幣記賬，互相清算其由國際貿易所發生的一切國際貸借。換句話說，即一同出口貨欵，須與對另一國進口貨欵相抵，而免除外匯的收付。這種方法可以行於兩國雙方面的，也可以行於三方面的。</p>
<p>五，外匯平準基金（Exchange　Equallztion　funds）——由一國金融當局，籌設一種基金，專為平準外匯之用，如英國與美國都在實行。這種方法，就是當輸出旺時，中央銀行購入外匯；輸入旺時，則售出外匯，以資調劑的方法。</p>
<p>（四）犧牲者的創痕</p>
<p>在各國一致的放棄金本位，實行通貨管理制，用貨幣戰爭以侵略市場，刺激生產的現在，惟有以法國為中心的金集團，仍舊保持它們「光榮的孤立」，保守金本位的壁壘。</p>
<p>然而這種保守是用了偌大的犧牲換來的，等它獲得「光榮」的　　時，早已是創痕壘壘，而一般人民則艱苦備嘗了。</p>
<p>如果我們與檢查這些「光榮的孤立者」的創痕，則可以有下面的數字供給我們參考。</p>
<p>金集團諸國批發物價指數（一九一三　〇〇）</p>
<p>一九一九　一九二〇　一九二一　一九二二　一九二三　一九二四</p>
<p>法　二一七·三　二二·五　一〇一·九　八六·八　八〇·九　七六·四</p>
<p>比　二一二·九　一〇八·四　九〇·二　七七·二　七二·三　六八·〇</p>
<p>意　四八一·〇　四一一·〇　三四二·〇　一一〇·〇　二八二·〇　二七六·〇</p>
<p>荷　一四二·〇　二七·〇　九七·〇　七九·〇　七四·〇　七八·〇</p>
<p>金集團諸國工業生產指數（一九一八　〇〇）</p>
<p>一九二九　一九三〇　一九三一　一九三二　一九三三　一九三四</p>
<p>法　一〇九·四　一一〇·二　九七·六　七　·六　八四·三　七八·四</p>
<p>比　一〇一·一　八九·八　八二·八　六九·九　七一·七　六一·三</p>
<p>意　一〇九·二　一〇〇·三　八四·七　七三·〇　八〇·五　八七·一</p>
<p>荷　一〇二·五　九三·七　八一·〇　六三·九　七〇·九　七〇·九</p>
<p>注據League　of　Naflon　Montyly　Bulleting　of　Statietics所載</p>
<p>單就金集團諸國的批發物價指數與工業生產指數來看，在恐慌開始後，江河日下的趨勢，我們可以知道了。近二年的情形，如果與放棄金本位的國家來比較，恰成了對照。例如美國的批發物價指數由前年的九四·五，增加到去年的一〇七·二，英國也由一〇〇·九增加到一〇四·〇。他如國際貿易，倒閉及失業，放棄金本位的諸國無不顯示增進或改善，而未放棄金本位的諸國則是「每況愈下」。無怪加塞爾教授（A.Caosel）要說世界景氣的不能恢復是要臨罪於金集團儲國的勉強維持金本位了。</p>
<p>（五）將來的趨勢——法郎前途如何？</p>
<p>自從本年三月比利時放棄金本位後，荷蘭也岌岌不保：一般人的視線都集中於法郎，以為金布洛克既行分化，法國金本位的前途也就危在旦夕了。</p>
<p>從法國一般經濟的情勢上觀察，從法國財政的困難上觀察，或者從法國藏金的大量流出上觀察，誰都有理由證明法郎的前途並不是那麼安全。據五月二十七日申報所載自五月八日以來，法蘭西銀行喪失的黃金僅美國一處已有三千萬鎊之多。而同時「法國預算案的辭海一萬三千五百萬鎊，其財政所遭遇之恐慌，為普恩　（Poincaer）秉政以來所未有。」——五月一十八日申報。</p>
<p>但是，這現世碩果僅存的權威貨幣果然就從此傾墜與否？恐怕誰也不敢回答。我們知道，法郎的穩定，有它特殊的基礎，如果要探索它的安危，除了表面的現象，還得對於它這種特殊的基礎有所了解。</p>
<p>第一，就法國傳統政策方面觀察。自大戰以後，法國人民飽受法郎膨脹之苦，一九二八年經法郎救主普恩　整理以來，漸趨安定；而對舊日之痛苦，尤然談虎色變。故法國政府與人民，均一致維護法郎之安全，而反對其放棄金本位或貶值。歷次內閣，均明白表示維護法郎之決心。每遇財政法案通過國會之時，國會與政府均協力削減預算，以保收支之平衡，而避法郎的膨脹。據報電所傳，這次法國財政感受極大的困難，而政府對外界之表示，仍為堅決維護法郎之安全（五月二十八日申報）。</p>
<p>其次，從法國經濟的搆造方面觀察，法國與其他國家皆有所不同。如英美各國，放棄金本位的目睥，一方在提高物價，刺激生產，增進輸出；一方也從貨幣貶值，以減輕國內債務者的債務負擔。美國私人債務達七〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美金，且此種債務，多分散於無數之小債務者，而債權則集中於少數之金融機關。法國私人債務甚少，人民多投資於政府公債，故其債務為政府對於人民之債務。所以美國貶低幣值，減輕債務，為一般人民所歡迎；而在法國則為一般人民所反對。</p>
<p>最後，就法國金備的充實來說，法國也沒有放棄金本位的必要。直至去年年末，法國金準備從未低於八百萬萬法郎，與紙幣流通額中的比例亦從示低於百分之七十。（據國際聯盟統計月報）我們知道，現金的流出有二種方式：一為以紙幣兌取現金或以支票取現金而流出，一為法國自行輸出現金以抵償國際債務。就現時之情勢看來，後者為不可能，而前者則現金減少，即　債務亦隨之減少，對於存儲準備　並沒有絲毫損失。據近電所傳，「官場確信政府必不抑低法郎價值，蓋金準備現仍有十一萬萬鎊，足以就會任何緊急事態也。」（五月二十八日申報），就是一個證明。</p>
<p>話雖如此說，但是我的意思並不是說法郎的地位現在仍是絕對的安全。因為我們知道，所有傳統政策，保暖不是一成不變的，即使怎樣穩固的勢力，也沒有力量換得偷天換日的本領，以彌補財政上的偌大的差額。而所謂顧全多數農民及富有者等的證券握有者的利益，也究竟敵不過整個產業經濟的衰頺，與乎大量勞工失業的痛苦。除此而外，還有他國的責難；那麼，即使法國還能披著殘廢的金本位的衣冠，又有什麼意義呢？</p>
<p>法蘭西銀行是素來被命為一個無底的藏金之窟的，保有金貨的雄厚自然是它可以驕傲的一點。然而據外電傳來，自去年三月二十九日以迄於今，損失的現金已達二，三七二，〇〇〇，〇〇〇法郎之數了（五月二十七日申報），近頃投機家更肆活躍，至本月底恐還不止於此。法郎西銀行貼現率出二厘半增至四厘，據說還有增加的可能，手足無措，也可見一般了。</p>
<p>我的結論是，法郎的金本位暫時容或有它維持的可能，如果一般的經濟情勢不改善，則放棄也只是遲早的問題。世界通貨的前途，也許不久都只能以紙票相見；那時，該請世界的經濟學者，再來談世界的本位制度吧。—二四年五月二十八日—</p>

<p>前讀本刋揭載吾界先進汪企張氏大作「本埠日報中醫藥副刋統計的觀察」。知本埠各報之定期醫藥刋物。除舊醫外。計有十六種之多。洋洋乎大觀也。吾醫界同仁熱心醫藥衛生常識之宜傳也。夫吾民族之危機。至今巳極。日處水深火熱中。其生命不絕如樓。政洽經濟之壓迫。固不待言。卽人口壓迫。亦爲嚴重之問題。而人口壓迫之原因。世人輒歸咎於天災人禍。實則天災人禍。非不可禦也。而由於醫藥事業之不發達。衛生建設之未積極。科學的醫藥常識未普及。於是死亡枕籍。束手待斃。故吾人欲挽救民族之危險。對政治經濟之壓迫。誠宜奮鬥掙扎。以求出路。卽於人口問題息息相關之醫藥衛生事業。亦屬當務之急。不容忽視。講求醫藥衛生之道固多。但使社會人士了解醫藥衛生之重要。尤居首要。庶幾能由信仰發生力量。於是文字宣傳。實爲必要之道。此吾界同仁。於執業之暇。不得不貢其一得於社會者也。且以吾國現社會醫藥情形言之。至爲複雜。旣有以科學爲根基之新醫。復有神秘虛偽之舊醫。新舊優劣。並存於社會。不第一般民衆。目爲之迷。致無正確之認識。卽處廟堂决策者。亦復模稜兩可。莫知所從。夫旣知科學之價值。復信舊醫之謬說。矛盾孰甚。此吾界同仁。欲使社會認識科學新醫之價值。及矯正民衆守舊之觀念。更不得不從醫藥衛生常識之宣傳也。挽近以來。社會觀聽。漸見轉移。宣傳之功。誠不可沒。然以嚴正之眼光。加以觀察。則知今日各報副刊之宣傳醫藥文字。其間宗旨純正。立論準確者固多。而令人懷疑者。亦不能免。筆者抱春秋責備賢者之義。心所謂危。有不能已於言者。如某某醫刋。通信問病一欄。其答案中所介紹之藥物。是否適於病人。固成問題。且其藥物。類多外商之出品。對於功效相同之國人自製藥品。獨棄若敝屣。不屑爲之介紹。使我國漏巵日大。甘爲外藥作宣傳前驅。吾醫界同仁。奈何見不及此耶。其他如某醫刋內。所稱某種危難之症。唯有求治於某醫院或某醫生，（事實上卽該刋物之編輯人）卽能轉危爲安。學術之造詣、固有深淺之分。然爲自己炕染治績。或言逾其實。以招徠病人。儼然商賈。其手段殊爲卑劣。其居心更不可問。社會上將視吾輩新醫爲何如人。試問此後之宣傳醫藥文字。尙有人顧及之耶。用敢忠告吾界同仁。宣傳醫藥常識。其宗旨必須純正。其觀念必非爲我。乃能義正詞嚴。發聾振振膭。有識之士。信仰乃堅。醫藥衛生事業之推廣。將一日千里。否則。一馬害羣。則其他良好刋物。亦將遭人蔑視。同歸於盡。新醫界一綫曙光。頓告消滅。其阻礙新醫　　之發展。民族之生存。誠有不忍言者矣。</p>
<h3 id="c175">啤酒桶與蹺蹺板 <a href="#c175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— 月祺</p>
<p>—醫學故事之一—</p>
<p>爲斷定肺部的症狀而設的各種診察方法，現在已很完備了；而「敲診」與「聽診」是其中最普通的，也是最初步的。敲診是用手指叩胸膛，聽診是用聽筒聽胸膛，二者都是藉醫生的敏感的聽覺從皮膚外面辨別肺部的病狀。但說起這兩種診察法的來歷，倒是頗有趣味的故事。</p>
<p>敲診的發源地，是十八世紀中葉奧國葛萊茲地方一個小旅館的院子。這小旅館的名字，呌做做Zum　Swartzen　Mohren意思就是「以摩爾黑婦人爲記」。旅館主人名呌奧安勃魯格（Auentruger），他的兒子，名呌里波耳特（Leopold）。是一七二二年十一月十九日出世的。里波耳特長大後，帮助他的父親管理店務。這旅館兼賣啤酒：啤酒藏在木　桶裏，取用的時候只要拔出桶邊的栓子酒就流出來了。猜知桶　剩有多少酒是經濟上很重要的事情。桶是木頭做的，呌人怎樣看得見裏面的酒呢？但年靑的里波耳特却從他的父親那里學得一種方法，雖不十分準確，却是很簡單的。把酒桶堅起，用手掌在桶邊從上向下敲打。在項端，因爲裏面只有空氣沒有酒，音調是低的：敲到裏面有酒的地方，音調便驟然高得多了。</p>
<p>後來，里波耳特志願習醫，人維也納大學讀書，成績頗佳；執業後，聲要日隆，國王聘請他做御醫。某日，他的一個病人死了。當時解剖屍體的風氣已開始通行；他把這病人的屍體剖開來看，發見胸膛內藏貯一種液體——膿汁：這是他意想不到的病症。於是他暗自思忖：當這病人未死的時候，他爲什麼想不到病人的胸膛內貯有液體呢？用什麼方法去考查病人的的胸膛內有液體與否呢？突然，他的父親用手敲打酒桶的情形，在他的腦海出現了。貯液體的胸膛正和盛酒的木桶相似。不透明的皮膚好比桶壁；裏面也是空氣有上液體在下，他决定要試試看，這以後，遇有病人呌他診察，他就用手指在他的胸膛上輕輕敲打，察聽聲音。這方法居然有效。藉這方法，他能發見病人胸膛內的液體，而且間或發見肺結核和肺炎的固結，他把這方稱爲Percussicn，意卽「敲診」，並於一七六一年以新發明爲題著文發表其事。</p>
<p>那時以前，沒有人想到「察聽」因空氣進出肺部而起的聲音，或心臟因抽唧而液而作的聲音。這是到了一八一四年由另一個醫生於無意中發明的</p>
<p>某日，一個法國醫生，名呌萊尼克（Rene　Theophile　HjaeintbeLaemec）的，在巴黎尼克醫院附近散步。他身材瘦弱，面貌淸瘸，但他却是巴黎市上最忙碌最時　的醫生，醫院中滿住着軍隊裏的兵士。他們多數患肺結核而死。這位仁慈的醫生一壁走一壁想：要是有什麼方法可以把這病症早期診察出來，治療就一定容易得多。他無意中看到一羣兒童玩着蹺蹺板。他們玩的不是平常的蹺蹺板游戲，却是利用蹺蹺板「打電報」。一個把耳朶貼在一端板上聽，另一個拿針在另一端板上搔括；他們依然自定的「密碼」一搔一聽，藉以傳達消息。聽明的萊尼克突然觸動靈感：假如用一、枝木管按在胸膛上聽，也許可以聽出聲音來的。他試一下，聲音果然有的。他把從各種病人的胸膛聽到的各種聲音記錄下來又從屍體解剖對照各種聲音的意義，居然獲得成功。他是發明聽診器的始祖；他的銅像還聳立在坤堡（Buimper）的市塲上啦。</p>
<h3 id="c176">最後病的診金 <a href="#c176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>所謂「最後病」者。就是人生最末一次的病，換句話說：就是送終的病，最後病是無論何人所必須經過的，也就是無論何醫在診治若干病人之中所必定遇到的。可是病家往往因爲病人死了，就借此不付診金，醫師如加以追索，病家就加醫師以過失殺人的罪名，控告醫師於法院。醫病糾紛的案伴，十之八九都由追索最後病診金而起的，因此，最後病的診金，便成爲現在醫病雙方所最要討論的問題了！請詳論之：</p>
<p>診金者，醫師的一種勞苦報酬也，牠的授受，絕對的與疾病結果的凶吉無關，因爲診病是一種契約醫病雙方各有應盡的義務，診病者，醫師所應盡之義務也，付診金者，病家所應盡之義務也，假使有一方不履行他的義務，這就顯然破壞契約的成立。所謂診病者，其定義又是怎樣呢！就是忠誠地盡心盡力地爲病人解除痛苦。盡治療上的能事，但是遇到不治之症，發生不良的結果，那是任何人不能負責的，天下决沒有包醫病愈的神醫，也决沒有枵腹從公的職業，些許的診金，難道就能算病人生命的代價嗎？現在社會人士，對於這一點往往根本誤會，以爲出了診金，就希望醫師包治，病人死了。都以爲是死於醫不死於病，借此就不付診金，這不是根本錯誤嗎？</p>
<p>診金與診病的定義旣如上述，那麼最後病的診金，無疑的是應當照付了，歐西各國，對此最後病的診金，法律上有嚴密的規定，卽如法國民法第一二零一條。其大意如下：</p>
<p>「無論病人結果如何，最後病的診金，病家或死者之繼承人，必須照付，卽使病家破產或變賣家產之時，醫家有優先承受之權。」</p>
<p>這條法律所應注意的，就是「無論病人結果如何」一語，蓋人沒有不死的，醫生沒有不診治最後病的。這句話的意思就是防北病家以疾病結果之吉凶爲診金照付與否之標準，至於雖然破產，還要償還，那無疑地是一方面恐怕病家不知道診金之必須照付，一方面又防止病家借收入不敷，或已破產等語來延宕搪塞。照這樣看來，診金是病家對於醫師的一種債務，醫師對於未付診金的病家，是居於優先的債權人的地位了！吾國人民法律知識較歐西先進國家爲淺薄，不知道診金的付予是病家的義務，而我國的法律也尙不免有掛漏的地方，所以我把最後病的診金問題特別提出來討論一下，以備立法諸公的採擇，這也是保障醫業，及减少醫病雙方糾紛的一道阿！</p>

<p>（五十）因糖尿病所引起的眼病（續）</p>
<p>糖尿病，一名消遏症。吾國昔時久巳知之，據歷史記載，如司馬相如亦曾患之。查舊醫之所以名之日，消渴症，蓋由于患者因血中含糖之份量太多，需飲多量之水份，使糖能由腎　排出，因</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>此而致病人常感覺口渴，又因多量之葡萄糖，身體不能利用之，拼出體外，致身體營養受影響而日漸其瘦，這完全是就其病症而定之病名。就病理上言之，糖尿病之眞眞原因，是胰臟中之蘭氏島腺發生病變，致身體內缺乏蘭氏島腺之分泌物（因蘇林）按因蘇林之功用為能使肝糖鉍成筠葡，並使葡萄糖能分析燃燒而發生熱與力，一旦缺乏了因蘇林，則糖在血中不能燃燒積在血中，因為血要維持牠固有成分，須將增多的糖，由腎臟排出，否則就要發生血糖過多症，（Hyperglykamie）糖尿病之症狀，約略言之，為多尿，貪食，易飢餓，因渴而常需飲多量水份，人日漸消瘦，而覺乏人，患者大多為常食精細食品，而少運動之上等社會人士，按此病確有遺傳關係，此外肥胖病及痛風亦可致之，肥胖及痛風之原因，皆為由于多食富于蛋白質及脂脈之食品，且其人可于運動，這類人士，多因為生活方面安閒，難覺多尿貪食，易飢，煩渴，多飲，乏力，但因營養佳良，並不消瘦，故多患之病，已久而尙不自覺，大多由于檢相身體，騐尿而始發見之，如果是輕病的，尙無大礙，若是重症，則有發生糖尿病性暈迷，（Kema　Diabeticum）而有致死之危險，故糖尿病若能早期　　之，注意飲食，尙不致發生生命危險，現在除了，般人所共知的騐尿中之糖份外，還有在視器管方面，因糖尿病所引起之變化，亦可作為早期發作診斷之助，關於視器管病變，常見者為眼筋麻痺，眼球强直，可致針視或有調節麻，痺及鉍性神經萎縮，以致視力减弱，　生雙視或致失明，有時可致白內障，名曰糖尿病性白內障（Katarakta　Diabetika），發生視覺障礙因致失明，早期診斷上最要者，確為糖尿性網膜炎，（Retinitfs　Diabetica）此症之主覺方面，最初祇為視力减弱，或稍有視覺障礙或竟全不覺之，　須經眼科專門醫師施行眼底檢査，始　見眼網膜，有鮮明白色小斑點，很似蛋白尿性網膜炎，常多誤為由于腎臟炎蛋白水尿所致，實則是由于糖尿病之關係，由此可知眼底檢査不祗能診斷眼病，並且可以檢騐出因內症而引起眼的變化，一般人以為眼病是局部的疾病，而不注意之，實在有許多眼病與　症有密切之關係。例如今天所講的糖尿病，此外還有腎臟炎，白血病（Leukamie）等，皆可先期由眼底檢　而得確實診斷。</p>

<p>— 李興</p>
<p>癤　癰　組織炎　膿腫</p>
<p>皮肉上有幾種疼痛的毛病，有時也很危險。病人所要的是止痛，醫師也應當為病人止痛，凡可能减去的疼痛减去，凡可能除掉的危險除掉。病者雖是要止痛，但同時也不可不顧及生命的安全</p>
<p>癤　是皮膚局部發炎，多半生膿後漸愈。其原因為葡萄菌生於毛孔內或皮膚脂肪腺內。有人整年生癤，此起彼伏，多是由於腎排洩不健全，或糖尿症，或身內糖質新舊代謝作用不健全。</p>
<p>癤平常多不甚大，疼痛也有限，多半也沒有危險。癤初起如用飽和硫酸鎂液浸布墊，熱冷敷，於止痛消腫有相當的裨益。如此行一日數次有希望將癤化去。若另敷以止痛藥膏或止痛藥水亦無不可。關於癤子還有兩件須留意的事、卽：（一）務保護癤使不受傷，因受傷易使癤變大，且可使細菌侵入血內發生危險。（二）癤熟內中有膿時須割開將膿放出。萬不要怕一時小痛。假設不將膿放出，久之癤內膿易被血吸去運到身體別部可以使生瘡發炎，運到腎內可以生腎炎。割癤放膿也是一種止痛的辦法。不割時癤張痛，割後張力全消疼痛自停。</p>
<p>癰　是皮肉部的一種壞疽，由於生膿的葡萄菌局部侵入。患者多為身體抵抗力低的。有腎病與糖尿症的較易生癰疽。癰疽起始發硬，疼痛，癰上皮膚發紅發灰，腫漸擴大至飯碗大小的也不為奇。生癤最平常的地位是項部，背部，肩部，臀部，因為這些部分組織抵抗力較低。</p>
<p>癰疽生於面部的平常稱為「疔瘡」。普通人也多知道疔瘡是危險的。至於為什麽疔瘡危險，他們也講不出所以然，不過他們曉得有人死於疔瘡。我們曉得面部血流是很充足的，並且面部的回血有一部分經靜脈管先至腦下然後再回到心內。癰部靜脈管內常由細菌生血栓，致發炎擴張到腦下大靜脈內。如腦下大靜脈被細菌侵入生膿，病就不能救藥。一有靜脈血栓毒菌就很容易侵入血內。毒菌侵入血內也是不易治好的病。毒菌侵入腦下大靜脈為面部癰疽（疔瘡）的特別危險。病菌侵入血內為任何癰疽所可引起的危險。</p>
<p>癰疽旣是如此危險，故治療宜本以　兩種目標：第一是止痛，醫師在可能範圍內總是要為病者北痛。北痛應採用局部作用方法而不應採用全身作用方法。注意注射麻醉品與內服止痛藥片是屬於全身作用　我們曉得癰疽是一種很危險的　　，死亡率非常的高，應當保全病者身體完全的抵抗力。麻醉品與止痛藥片多减少身體抵抗力。乖危的病勢一分抵抗力與生死有極大的關係。萬不可妄求一時止痛而自滅生機。</p>

<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>氣胸的治療，除患者須絕對安息外，一切物理的檢査工作，須儘量减少；麻醉劑之應用，亦在所必須，但大都不見卓效。對於呼吸困難之平止，為一最重要之工作，這方面頂要緊的，自不能不推胸腔氣之吸取了！這是一個不十分輕易的手術，醫者應該謹愼從事的。滲出液過多，則行使穿刺手術；膿氣胸則須反覆行使空刺手術，或用尋常的膿胸外科手術亦可，惟對於結核患者須留意</p>
<p>第四節　消化器管</p>
<p>關於消化器管方面的合併症，自不能不惟重腸結核，為最重要的了！他的忠者之數計，也是着實驚人的；據病理學家的報告，在全體的結核病者中，是差不多百分之五十以上，係兼忠腸結核的。他是發現於嚴重開放性的結核以後的：滲出性的型式姑無須說得，就是增生性破變性也是一樣的。他的發生，大半係因肺結核患者頦嗽時的痰哩，由咽喉下咽而達腸部所致的；痰中的結核菌，當然是他的媒介了！此外，初發性的腸結核症，也在可能之列的；像結核性的牛乳之內服，未經煮熟之結核性動物肉，以及結核病人食具之隨便應用，都是很顯著的原因：這一種情形，在本書的第二章食物的傳染一段中，已經約略提過了；我想　者們大概總還能追憶的。</p>

<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>我　有一位廁身於敎育界的朋友，他是很努力於新興的字運動的。昨天我又遇見他，問他這幾大勸導文盲識字的成績如何？他把頭搖了一搖，嘆了一口氣道，「難」</p>
<p>他說，一我的鄰居家，雇傭着一個近三十歲的老媽子，我想這是極該使伊認識些字的，於是在每日課餘，再凑着伊的工餘，敎伊三個字。我想這麽着，一年之後，伊也可認　一千左右字了。</p>
<p>「我這麽認眞的敎，伊倒也很認眞的讀。可是一星期之後，那老媽子亳無理由的拒絕我了。事後，才知伊的太太說那老媽子跟我太親熱了，要停伊的生意呢。</p>
<p>「同時，我還每天敎着對門那包車央。我也準備在一年之中，敎他認識一千字。豈知他的東家，是一位沒念滿三年書的吃金子飯的商人，生怕包車夫此他識字多了，有碍於他的榮譽，於是一方面諷嘲，一方面恐嚇的也逼得那包車夫只得不念了。</p>
<p>「弄口的一個皮匠攤上，有師徒二人，都是沒念過一天書的，於是我想也每天各敎三個字。敎了三天，他們也不念了。問其理由，說的是時間之於手藝工人，是再也寳貴不過的。雖然每天讀三個字，似乎也花不掉多少時間，但是每天就算一刻鐘，一個月算來，就得要少做不少生活呢。手藝人是手一停，便得餓肚子的，怎來這工夫識字呢？</p>
<p>「還有，是弄裏一家大戶人家的婢女，我才敎伊識了六個字，被累伊給主婦餓了一天飯。」他垂頭喪氣的說着，「這年頭兒，要推行識字運動，還是很難咧。」</p>
<p>但是他最後，却依然是很堅决地說，「無論如何，我還是要努力！」</p>

<p>— 吳雅非</p>
<p>為了整理書櫥，便在櫥角落里發現了一幅畫卷：那是一幅一柳溪乖釣圖一。但可惜得很：這幅盡僅成得一半，而父親已來不及脫稿而溘然長逝了！他現在離世已二十年，然而他那幅未完的畫自從母親交給了我後，我就很小心的把它藏在書櫥里。不過記得當時母親　曾噙着眼淚這樣對我說：</p>
<p>「菲，這輻畫是你父親最後的遺物，也是他一生唯一的遺產；因為他死的時候你還年幼，一切都不懂，我現在把這幅畫交給你，你要小心的把它收藏，也算紀念你的父親」！母親說着竟哭了。我雖然不認識父親，並且父親的死我也記不得，可是我確實也很懷念我的父親。</p>
<p>我現在也是一個孩子的父親了；然而我因此不免有些駭怕起來！因為母親常常吿訴我，我的父親很年靑就死的，他是給生活所磨死的。想起來眞使我担心；我現在不是正年靑嗎？而生活的磨盤却已壓在我的肩背上了！</p>
<p>父親本是一僩很活潑而有朝氣的靑年，可是後來為了生活，為了負担，更受到了許多不如意的襲擊；於是他就消沉，他就憂鬱了。而且不久又患了肺病，當時母親和親戚們都這樣的寬慰他：</p>
<p>「你自己應該慧解開些，不要太憂愁，日子雖然總得要過的，而你的身體也是要緊的啊」！但是他很倔强，並且不相信自己就會死的。</p>
<p>「不，我不能够安息，為了生活，更要還債；孩子們不能讓他餓肚子，債不能失信用，肺病就能够毀減我的前途，阻止我的掙扎了嗎」？他的口氣是多麽堅定，多麽有勇氣，絕不像一個有肺病而將垂死的人。</p>
<p>生活一天一天的向他逼緊上來，債更是一些不曾減少，肩膀上的壓迫是更重了。於是他也開始到懷疑：「我的前途眞的便被肺病毀滅了嗎？它眞能够阻止我這最後的掙扎嗎？可是生活還是要生活下去的呵！債仍舊要還的呵一！他由懷疑而不敢信任自己的勇氣，甚至因了他種種奮鬥的失敗而悲哀了。「嘆！我的理想完全幻滅了嗎？一些希望都沒有了嗎」？他雖然還有些不相信；但，一看釗週遭的黑暗，他覺得什麽都是空虛的了。</p>
<p>一日一月，一年，時光是很快的在他生命中飛逝，他的肺病是跟着光陰而漸漸加深，他的悲哀也隨着肺病而加重。每天早晨起來便須咳出許多痰，夜間時常盜汗和失眠，飯量也减少了一半，臉色是蒼白得可怕；顴骨高聳，眸子深陷，如果躺在板門上，人家一定會疑　他已沒有了氣的。</p>
<p>因為沒有錢，所以始終沒有醫過，雖然吃了許多丹方，可總像石沉大海，見不到一些功効！母親乾着急，但有什麽辦法？只有眼巴巴的看着父親一天一天的不支起來；於是他終于在一個春犬的中午離開了我們，並且丟下了那幅在病中所作的絕筆——未完的畫——而去了！</p>
<p>如今每當我把這幅畫展開來的時候，便會想到死去的父親，而同時我的淚腺也止不住像山洪一樣的暴發了！</p>
<p>「父親這樣年靑便給生活磨練死了，我不要像父親一樣呵」！現在只要我一想到這些，便會戰慄的！</p>

<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>先日比利時有一位社會黨領袖　迪文，在該黨婦女大會發表演說，略謂：「目前世界正處十字路口，一方面進行和平及軍縮政策，另一方面則繼續從事</p>
<p>樊氏的話很不錯。現在的世界，紛紛攘攘，正徬徨在和平與戰爭的十字路口，呈着極端杌隉不安之狀。從表面上看，世界各國，好似酷受和平。他們列强，時常都在奔走呼號，喊出什麽和平呵軍縮呵的聲調。但從實際上看，大家都在和平的假面具之下，彼此劇烈進行着軍備的競爭。人類的大厄運，遲早間必有臨頭的一天。</p>
<p>然而現今世界各國，雖有不少手握大權的野心政治家及軍人，在那裏瘋狂備戰，但一般人民的心理，却眞實是痛惡戰爭，愛好和平的。舉一則實例來說，最近英國發起一個和平投票運動，提出五項問題，舉行公民投票，結果參加投票的二百萬英國人，傾向和平者，竟佔大多數。這便是人民愛好和平的明證。</p>
<p>可是人民的愛好和平是無用的，世界戰爭仍然不能避免。前天有兩位熟識國際情事的美國記者，對世界戰爭下過一種預測說，目前世界軍備已太重大，正如一大火藥庫，卽極細的導火綫，亦能使之爆發。這觀察現在十分正確。</p>
<p>故現在的世界，雖然還是一個和平的世界，但這個和平世界是不能維持長久的。只要各國實力充足，時機一至，第二次大屠殺便會開始。到那時，這個和平的世界，也就變成戰爭的世界了。</p>

<p>— 艾荼</p>
<p>白天，炎烈的太陽好像火一樣燒着海濱的一切，可是，海濱上的一切永遠不會乾癟了的，永遠是給海水濕透地湧出黃色的膠性的液質的。不過，往往地，圍繞着我們的園子的河冲却常常地像赤這綫上一樣的蒸發出白色的輕烟，實在的，水是快要到沸點的時候，河冲裏養着的魚兒也蒸得死了，很多的淌在水面，透出了腥臭的氣息，一陣一陣地跟着悶鬱的風掠進我們的心靈裏。每到了夏天，南方的海濱都是這樣地，從早上到黃昏，一切都給火燄燒着的。有一次，天氣熟得那麽可怕的：</p>
<p>「準會下雨了，而且這一躺怕是大風雨吧。」</p>
<p>果然的，當太陽帶着火燄溜落西方的時候，天空裏怖恐地盪着黑雲。跟着　來平日很少有的狂暴的海風，嗚嗚地響着。我們把工作完了以後，在茅寮裏燒好了晚飯，照例地喫了一大盤靑菜和一些魚蝦，喝着用鹹水燒的素湯。正在這個時候，黑的天空隆隆地響着可怕雷聲，霹霹靂靂的。</p>
<p>「這夜裏怕不能够舒舒服服的睡覺了，暴風雨已來臨了。」</p>
<p>說着，我跟阿輝兩個人開始把茅寮的罅隙處補好。因為這茅寮也是我們自己用殘舊的磚瓦和一些葵葉架搭起來的，樣子很矮小，有點像古代的遊獵人的住居一樣的。當然是不大堅固，更不能够喫得住可怕的大風雨的摧殘。而且是經騐告訴我們，狂暴的風雨會把茅寮頂上的葵葉吹走了的。</p>
<p>天黑了，我們躺在狹小的茅舍裏的板床上要睡了。這時，風聲越來得響亮而可怕的，好像是怒吼的老虎一樣，門外的狗兒在吠着，帶着佈恐的樣子搖着牠的尾巴，——這時候的宇宙是凄凉的，尤其是在荒蕪的海濱，好像在鬼的世界裏似的，洶湧的濤聲滾個不停的。然而，我們疲乏得很，管他是怎麽樣的大風雨呢？於是，在茅舍的搖動中陲去了。</p>
<p>等到我們的臉給雨水淌濕了，感到像冬天一樣的凉寒的時候，我們才驚醒了起來；</p>
<p>「阿輝喂，屋頂的葵葉已給風吹起了。快點兒修理吧。」</p>
<p>於是，我們馬上點着火油燈，找出了一把繩子，在淋漓着的雨水中赤着肩膊爬上了屋頂。捱着風雨的鞭笞地　了命的修理起來。這時？天空盡是黑暗的，響着雷聲，閃着長蛇似的電光。我們的心是急的，而且身體上已感到可怕的寒凉了。經過許久的掙扎，我們才把茅舍修理好，可是，我們的床已濕透了。</p>
<p>又是在凄凉的黑夜進行曲了，我們疲乏地睡去了。到了第二天的早上，太陽從東方帶着鮮艷的顏色出來的時候，我們又開始過着那樣平淡的工作了。</p>
<h3 id="c191">夜譚 <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— 曼莎</p>
<p>遙遙的長夜從天空的星光下罩上她黑色的輕紗，神經便從長日的困頓間淸醒起來。看着屋子裏空寂墳墓，而孤獨的靈魂被寂寞的黑手所緊緊攫住的時候，便突然沈入過去熱鬧的回憶中。過去是有怎樣熱鬧和有趣的夜晚呵！</p>
<p>正是村的夏天，南風吹來了南海的凉氣。被月亮輝耀的瓜柵下，是多麽熱鬧和有趣啊！母親帶着成羣的小孩子，兄弟姊妹都被動人的故事所沈醉着。神秘的夜帶來神秘的雰圍，講述鬼和狐狸的動作嚇得小小的身軀縮抖。而今，成羣的孩子們都已變成大人；姐妹們旣出嫁，兄弟輩也都為了生活而各處奔波。這夏大月亮下的夜談，已是不可復得了；便想再從令人顫抖的故事中得到迷人的力量，這幻想顯見得也不能再現。但同時這夜談的佳味，却從心中萌了芽、使我接連記起許多次夜談的滋味來。</p>
<p>在某個南海之濱，海潮猛擊着石礁，咆哮作聲；風吹來北進的巨潮。我們幾個靑年人却關在一間臨海小屋子的小樓中，臨着小窗做長夜的健談。一切生命的課題的火燄從我們的深心燃燒起來；暢談着人生的奧妙，哲學的玄秘，文藝的美質，和其他大膽放縱，亳無拘束的言辭。靑春從我們的血液中鼓起了熱氣，而這熱氣却從各人的口中吐出了光芒。外面的海湖響應着我們的吼聲，而海風吹起了我們的慾望。一夜的無眠波埋沒在健談的鋒芒中：夜色繼續增長，而談鋒更越來越更尖利。時間旣被一刻刻地漸漸消磨？而夜的優雅和悠閑更被消融在年靑人的血液中、而從口沫間表現出來。</p>
<p>時間一溜便到達了壯年，却被驅在熱帶的夜晚。和朋友步行於椰林叢中；愛被赤道的磁石所吸引，滔滔的話語便從口角溜出來。高高的樹叢引誘起了生命內泌的神妙，兩人間的談鋒竟甜蜜得像融合在一起。一直步行到中夜，我們竟忘記我們曾訴說過些什麽話。一種迷茫而可愛的話語不住地像水流般從口角瀉出，我們只覺牠可愛，覺得牠甜甜地怪有味道，然而我們却不知道那究竟說了些什麽，這些話對於我們却是這麽地親密。</p>
<p>被生活拋到都市上海，人間的罪惡已在我們的心間暴露，一切從前的嗜好都改變凈盡了。每每我們慨嘆着人事的無常，和社會的黑暗，以及我們的悲憤和抑鬱。健美的談鋒是消磨凈盡了，然而對於前途還存着閃燃的火花，於是談鋒雖然未見犀利，却在灰色間保留着黯淡的色澤。一切的希望，的愛，這些大題目在我們的對談中已是無論如何過去了，然而中年人的談鋒，却會深深地挿入夜晚的黑色的輕紗，而把長夜　消磨過去的。</p>
<p>現在，不但孩童時代已成過去，便是年靑時的友朋也東西星散了。一切健談的對象一個個在眼前消失，一切引起健談的題材也漸漸地死亡。生，在眼前的黑夜中已成孤獨的陰影，靈魂是漸漸變成空洞了。在眼前，一支小小的燭光照着自己的孤影，外面黑夜的輕紗正罩上自己的心上。健談的對象消失了，而夜便在幻滅的悵然的孤影間搖曳着。過去健美的話鋒的追憶，更把靈魂籠罩得越加孤寂和灰黯，而令人異常悵惘起來。</p>

<h3 id="c192">當 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 秦鑒</p>
<p>（風物篇之一）</p>
<p>小的時候，有大人帶了上街，看到街上的僅有的一二爿當鋪，對着高高的一片大白牆上的大得可怕的「當字，是有着和藥鋪子外面的「道地藥材」，醬園門口的「官醬」，與廟宇兩旁的「南無阿彌陀佛」同樣的感覺的—左右全是大得可怕的黑字，誰知道裏面幹點什麽玩意兒呢。所不同的，就是當鋪裏却安置着比所有的鋪子都高的櫃台，對一個小孩子，這簡直是一片高牆！而這高牆裏面究竟有點什麽，却怎樣高不淸楚：也許是神秘的，不是孩子所能知道的吧？可是就為了這樣，對了這大得呌人看着頂就會掉下帽子的「當」，與那比整個的小小的身體還高一倍多的櫃台，感到一種神秘，也感到一種只適宜於放在孩子的心腔裏盤算的興趣。</p>
<p>到稍稍地長大一點，也認識得有二三百個方塊字的時候，便趕着大人巴巴地向那個呌人害怕，呌人懷疑，但也使人戚到典趣的奇怪的字，於是也學得的那一個「噹噹」地脆爽的發音：但當進一步去探究這高櫃台裏的玩意兒的時候，人却祇是說了那麽一句：「小孩子不懂得的。」</p>
<p>可眞是不懂得的啊，每次上街，總得向那高高的櫃台溜上一兩眼，瞧着三三兩兩的人，空手的，帶了包班的，臉上可全帶了一種說不出的窘迫的神情，就是長縮與籌滯，也說是熱切與担心吧？總之，那些人，進進出出的，可全有着一種並不像是得意，也並不像是愉快的臉，這可一點也沒有錯，然而，可又都麽呌人想不透，都呌人難解的呢。</p>
<p>而現今是十足地長大來了，自己失掉了永不會回來的童年，已經不再有孩子的心，也沒有人再拿「小孩子不懂的！」話來對自己吐喝與誇耀了。到這軀幹由高櫃台的一半而長成得和高櫃台一樣高的時候，已經充分地懂得了奇怪的大字的意義，懂得了這高櫃台裏面的悲劇，而且，生活得常常像在釘板上打滾，一些艱難的際會把人推到困乏的地步的日子，自己也就跟着其餘的人一樣，帶着一顆抖索與卑微的心站在高櫃台的前面，而做了這標着碩大的「當」字的鋪子裏的並不生疏的來客了。</p>
<p>生活在一處小小的城市裏，那麽沒有把握地，空蕩而孤另地，對生活上的孤獨的旅人，這奇特而呌人不快意的「當」鋪子，也正像荒山中的一個小小的宿店，在日暮黃昏的荒徑中，見了它，也許還是値得歡喜的呢（！）；於是，在短少了明天一家的伙食，而相識的又那麼識時務地凖備起了冷淡與呌苦的表情等着你的時候，便只得記起了那冷冷的呌人駭怕的大字，而悄悄地檢出一點東西，也許脫下了正穿在身上的衣衫，也許落下了一個不値錢而却是作為一件永遠的記念物那樣地佩帶着的小指環，懷着一種熱切而卑微的心情，躱去靜靜地站在高櫃台下面，等候着典價的同意，與些微的銀錢的付給。那麼着，便憻檀地又渡過一個難關了。</p>
<p>如今是，從生活中學得了「當」字的意義，而它對我，也從好奇轉到了可怕，從喜劇變成了悲劇了。都願意還有人來對我說：「這種事小孩子不懂的！」</p>
<p>然而，已經不是孩子了！</p>
<h3 id="c193">陶窖 <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— 瑞芝</p>
<p>南方的初夏，天氣已是很酷熱了。一淸早，那斗大的太陽從東方的山後一溜出來，大地上就佈滿了熱氣，微風從臉上吹過，也像是從火窟裏噴出來似的〇烘烘地。田野間的枯黃的稻苗，山坡上的倭樹，田舍上的烟囱，一切的景物都像死樣的沒有半點生氣。佈滿在山坡下的陶窖，也像是已經蒼老了的靜默默地躺在早晨的陽光裏。往日從早到晚不斷的有着人物在走動的那條上鎖去的大路，現在却是連一條餓狗的影子也沒有了。</p>
<p>從小就在燒瓷的窖子裏做工的老龍，他像是一條被打你的野狗一樣的瘦，骨頭好似要露出皮外，眼睛黃黃地沒有半點光亮，雖然他才四十多歲，但那滿臉的縐紋，却像是年紀很老了似的。他這時在田野間行着，眼睛不住的望着那天上的太陽，又望着那沒有一點火光的瓷窖。</p>
<p>「整整的三個月了，眞是過多些時述窰子裏都不能再燒碗了。從小就吃這碗燒瓷飯，却還沒見過像今年這樣的三個月沒生火呢！」他一面想着，腳又不由自主的走向瓷窖去，每天都是這樣。</p>
<p>三個月沒有生火燒碗的窖子裏，到處都佈滿着一層的灰泥，窖洞裏也已經都佈上了蜘蛛網了。但是推在旁邊的碗，一筐一筐的疊得很高。在往時，這裏是從沒有存着這末多的，只要一做成。就給鎭上的碗行買去了，但現在，却像廢物一樣，從三個月前堆到現在，從沒有動過。老龍看了這三個月來，不知看過了多少遍的情形，心裏也已經像是麻木了的沒有什麼感動，只不過搖搖頭，靜悄悄地走了。</p>
<p>是午後了，上鎭的大路上，又像往日一樣的〇鬧起來，男的女的，幾百人祖着幾百担碗的望着鎭上走去。老龍和他的兒子也每人祖着四重碗的雜在人羣裏。但這形象，顯然興往日是不同的，在從前，每日都是這末〇鬧，大路上並沒有斷過人跡，行動着的人，雖然一個個都給那擔在肩上的重量壓得流着汗喘着氣，但他們却走得很起勁，女人和男人的吵駡聲和笑聲，却是到處在嚮着。然而今天，雖然人是那末幾百，但都靜默着，笑聲一點也沒有，只有低聲的嘆氣和呼吸的喘息。每個人的臉，是淡黃的，餓狗似的一張張地臉都瘦黑得可怕。走動着的腳步是那末的遲緩，汗水流過那佈滿塵灰的臉，劃下了一條條黑色的痕跡。</p>
<p>江水是浪紅的，太陽照在上面更顯出光亮，這時停泊在岸邊的載碗的貨船，排的躺在靜寂裏，船艙裏空空地，一筐的貨物也沒有，這正像這幾百個担着碗到鎭上的瓷行的人一樣，他們被行裏拒絕不買，一羣羣地人，只好靜默默地坐在這江邊。他們看着往時不住把貨物運出去而現在却空空的貨船和自己的幾百担賣不掉的碗。幾百張的臉，幾百對的淡黃的眼睛，只是不住的對視着。</p>

<p>本月十六日在湖社演出</p>
<p>螞蟻劇團自第一次公演「金寶」獲得成功後，即積極籌備第二次演出，經數月之努力，已定於本月十六日在北京路湖社正式公演。該團為著名文化團體蟻社所創立，實力雄厚，除第一場全部供給其社友八百餘人免費觀覽外，尚有二場將於下午二時及八時上演。其劇本為中央大學校長羅家倫氏所譯英國女詩人「曼殊斐兒」之「臨別」，日本菊池寬之「貞節」，及該團團員自己創作之「兩個患難朋友」等，俱為意義深長，劇情動人之作。聞現已開始售券，南京路四馬路各大商店，及書局俱紛紛代為銷售，想該團本次公演，定又轟動一時也。</p>

<p>月明的聲片昏狂，因為是處女作，又因為一切都是從新措置，如有聲攝影棚，攝製樣械，以及劇本內容的增改，都是在精力物力上消耗頗大的事情，更因為「昏狂」故事開始的空間是四川，所以任彭年等一行四川也担擱了相當的時間，（固然，這中間為排攝新聞片也佔去了一部份。）回來攝內景的時間又化了幾個月，由前到後十足的化了一年時間，以一年時間僅撮成一部片子，無論如何也可見月明本身的能耐不小。現在，「昏狂」一切已早完竣，所以遲遲未見公映者，實因金城已排定的片子大擁擠的緣故，現在這是個千真萬確的消息，在「人之初」之後，就是「昏狂」的公映期，影迷們的望眼欲穿，可向這有驚人成績的處女作找得報償了。</p>

<p>銀幕上的演員固然缺乏，而童角更感到絕少。司徒慧敏導演的「自由神」裏的童星，本有蔡維寗，蔡維賢兩人，這是比較大的兩位，劇中還需要一位更小年齡的角色，飾這個兒童劇中人的幼稚時代。在多方的搜索下，又掘得一位嶄新的童星——任克。他僅三歲，懂得國語和上海白，會說廣東話，更會做戲。這與其說他是先天的遺傳，倒不如說他後天的悟性，幫助了他演技上的發展。在攝影場上，導演的指示下，許多觀眾的贊揚中，他表演出多種的姿態。有一次，飾他爸爸的施超回來了，他知道向他行着軍禮，高興地用手向他招着。可是他並不懂得這是在做戲，這對中的劇情怎樣，已有如此合理的成績，難怪來電通參觀的中央攝影場的演員們，要嘖嘖地稱贊了。</p>

<p>(Beiping) Military Attaché Isoya of the Japanese Embassy called on He at 9:00 this morning to explain the Japanese side's intentions, saying that the Japanese side would make a final reply to us after the meeting in Tianjin on the 12th. He should explain our handling methods and the facts to them with a sincere attitude, and at the same time express fundamental opinions on Sino-Japanese amity, cooperation, and good neighborliness. Chief of Staff Sakai Takashi and Oki of the Japanese North China Garrison and Japanese Military Attaché Takahashi in Beiping called on He at 11:00 to discuss matters. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) All officers and soldiers of the Central Gendarmerie Third Regiment boarded trains at Andingmen this morning to head south. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Isoya left Beiping this afternoon to return to Tianjin. Sakai and Oki returned to Tianjin tonight to await Doihara and Kita. More than 30 Japanese officers and soldiers stationed in Beiping went to Tianjin this morning for a rotation of duty. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese army in North China is increasing its defense forces, of which 800 men will arrive in Tanggu tomorrow afternoon, and will immediately take trains to be stationed in Beiping and Tianjin. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Takahashi received Chinese and Japanese reporters in the Japanese Embassy's military attaché's office this afternoon. He said that Military Attaché Isoya's visit to He this time was to listen to the Chinese central government's true attitude towards Japan. Doihara and Chief Kita are scheduled to arrive in Tianjin on the 10th, purely to convey the intentions of the Japanese Central Military Department and exchange views with local personnel. Negotiations on the Hebei issue are the responsibility of himself and Chief of Staff Sakai. He also visited He this afternoon to negotiate. He declined to disclose the content of the Hebei issue. (9th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The tension of the situation in North China has now eased. According to reliable sources, the Japanese are currently not presenting an ultimatum to the Chinese authorities in North China, and it is heard that the Japanese are currently revising their original demands of May 29. However, this statement has not yet been confirmed. The pessimism of the Chinese side is gradually turning into hope that the crisis can be resolved soon. Everyone feels that the Chinese authorities' clear willingness to resolve the issue peacefully should move even the most radical advocates among the Japanese military leaders. In addition to suspending the political training department of the Beiping Military Branch, He Yingqin has also ordered the dissolution of various secret organizations because their activities may hinder Sino-foreign friendship. He's move was caused by the Japanese demand to abolish various anti-Japanese groups in North China. At the same time, the Central Gendarmerie Third Regiment has begun to be transferred from Beiping to the south, and the two divisions of the Central Army stationed here will also be transferred to other places within a few days. As for the location of the retreat, it is not yet known. The 51st Army under Yu Xuezhong is still stationed in Baoding, and the Hebei Provincial Party Department has also moved to Baoding with the provincial government. Beiping newspapers reported He Yingqin's remarks to reporters from the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun, stating that China has agreed to various Japanese demands. This statement is indeed evidenced. Today, He received many foreign guests. The first to visit was Japanese Military Attaché Isoya, who had secret talks for several hours. It is heard that Isoya came to visit purely in a private capacity and does not represent the Kwantung Army. Sakai, Chief of Staff of the Japanese Army in North China, visited He this morning at 11:00, talking for one hour and forty minutes. This afternoon, Takahashi told Chinese reporters that Doihara and Kita came to visit North China and would convey the opinions of the Japanese Ministry of the Army to the Japanese Army authorities in North China. The two of them are prepared to participate in the negotiations. Takahashi refused to announce the details of his conversation with He Yingqin, but said that the Hebei issue should be resolved locally and does not need to go through the diplomatic authorities of the two countries. According to reliable Japanese sources, the North China issue seems to have been resolved after the Japanese military attaché met with He this morning. Isoya took a train to Tianjin this afternoon and will stay in Tianjin on Sunday before returning to Shanghai. Sakai returned to Tianjin by night train. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese Military Attaché Isoya arrived here from Tianjin last night. At 9:00 this morning, he went to visit He Yingqin and secretly talked until 10:15 before leaving. Japanese Military Attaché Sakai will also visit He this morning. According to reliable sources, the Japanese army did not present He with a document in the nature of an ultimatum, and its original demands have also been substantially revised, so there is hope for an early resolution of the Hebei issue. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Because the Chinese authorities have taken swift actions before the end of this week, the demands currently made by the Japanese side are not as serious as expected. When Sakai met with He Yingqin this morning, he only reiterated the previous proposals. It is expected that the peace crisis in North China can be completely eliminated. Reliable sources say that the postponement of Doihara's arrival in Beiping is the result of the improved situation. Doihara may not come to Beiping. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

Close cooperation with the United Kingdom, because after the reorganization of the British cabinet, its candidates are all suitable, and it is expected that its views in the Far East policy will be the same as those of the United States. 2. As long as there is hope for compromise between China and Japan, other countries should not take actions that stimulate Japan. 3. Absolute neutrality. 4. Resolutely not recognize "Manchukuo".

<h3 id="e14">Can the United States Change its Silver Policy for China? <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— End</p>
<p>Since the United States increased the price of silver, China's economic difficulties have multiplied. There is widespread hope that the United States can ease its silver purchasing policy, allowing for a slight respite to alleviate the immediate crisis. In particular, there is fervent anticipation that the U.S. economic mission to China will return home and convey what they have heard and seen to their countrymen, leading to a slight change in past attitudes. However, whether this will be effective remains to be seen. Let us tentatively examine the attitude towards silver prices that the United States has held over the years.</p>
<p>The United States has always been known for its silver production. The silver mining industry has a great influence within the country. Whenever silver prices fall, silver-supporting legislators, concerned with their own interests, always fight tooth and nail. As a result, the United States has used the method of absorbing silver to raise silver prices, not just since today. In 1878, when European countries stopped minting silver coins, silver prices plummeted. The U.S. government immediately passed a bill stipulating that the government would purchase two million to four million dollars worth of silver each month. However, it was still difficult to maintain silver prices. By 1890, a major panic occurred in London and New York. The United States then enacted the Sherman Law, purchasing 4.5 million ounces of raw silver each month at market prices. However, due to increasing silver production, the maintenance strategy ultimately failed. In 1892, silver prices continued to plummet. A monetary conference was convened in Brussels. By 1893, the Sherman Law was declared abolished. Silver prices then rapidly declined from forty-one pence per ounce. Only after the outbreak of the European War did silver prices gradually rebound. On February 10, 1920, silver prices reached their peak. The price of silver in New York rose to one dollar and forty-four cents. The price of silver in London also reached eighty-nine pence. However, in mid-June, silver prices experienced a major reversal, falling by half of the previous increase. Subsequently, silver prices declined sharply. After the devaluation of the British pound in 1931, the price of silver in London fell to twelve pence. The price of American silver also reached its lowest point of twenty-four and a half cents in the following year. The fluctuations in silver prices over these twelve years, like the height of mountains and the depths of valleys, fully demonstrate the ability to change. It is truly a grand spectacle. United States silver legislators, seeking to protect the interests of those they represent, attempted to raise the price of silver to one dollar and twenty-nine cents, making the ratio of gold to silver one to sixteen, thus creating the current situation.</p>
<p>The United States' increase in the price of silver is based on its own interests. Those who seek their own benefit are often driven by greed, not hesitating to harm others to benefit themselves. This is common. If the United States can suddenly change its course, it can only come about in two ways. One is that the supply of silver production increases, becoming overwhelming, ultimately making it difficult to achieve its goal of raising silver prices. The other is that harming others does not benefit oneself, deeply realizing that it does not meet expectations, and resorting to abandonment. In short, unless the Americans themselves want to abandon it and do so, it means they are forced to abandon it.</p>
<p>Silver production is often a byproduct of zinc, lead, and other mines. To increase silver production, it is necessary to increase the main products such as zinc and lead. If zinc and lead become oversupplied as a result, it is questionable whether the gains from higher silver prices can compensate for the losses. Even if that is not the case, silver production will also change due to rising silver prices. At that time, will they raise silver prices again or abandon them? However, this is not what this article wants to discuss. What we want to ask is, do Americans not see raising the price of silver as promoting the purchasing power of silver-using countries? If American trade with China continues to maintain its advantage, then those silver-supporting legislators will be even more vociferous, believing it to be a clever move. To hope that they will change their policy is like asking a tiger for its skin. However, the economic situation in China is the opposite. The higher the price of silver, the more difficult life becomes. Even if American goods are cheap due to the exchange rate, there will eventually be a day when the Chinese are unable to purchase them. That day is not far off. However, China has now reached a point where it relies on others for food and clothing, making it difficult to live without foreign goods. This is painful to say, but it is a fact that cannot be denied. Therefore, in the future, they will inevitably choose the cheapest foreign goods. This is something that American industry and commerce may not be able to compete with. Therefore, while it cannot be said that forcing the Chinese to take this path is the fault of the Americans, it is also due to a misunderstanding of the situation in China and the harm of standing idly by.</p>
<p>Self-help leads to the help of others. Seeking help from others is not as good as seeking help from oneself. Americans have this plan based on their own considerations. We Chinese should also plan from our own perspective and seek new avenues. Knowing that the current economic situation in China involves many issues, with obstacles arising everywhere and riddled with problems, it is not easy to remedy. However, we should not be afraid of difficulties and seek temporary ease, merely begging others for pity. We should brace ourselves, work together, and exhaust our talents and wisdom to resist the external dangers and terrifying waves. Who knows if we will not turn misfortune into good fortune and have a day to celebrate peace and tranquility together?</p>
<h3 id="e15">The Day After the New British Prime Minister Takes Office, He Announces His Policy Direction, Wishing the Whole Country to Unite and Persevere Unwaveringly, So as to Maintain its Leading Position in the World, Foreign Policy Based on the League of Nations <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>(London) Today, new Prime Minister Baldwin announced to the nation via broadcast that a government of national unity should continue to exist to ensure the continuation of trust and the maintenance of commercial revival. The new government intends to strive for peace and disarmament, believing that there will eventually be a day of success. He intends to adopt new procedures, with two cabinet members handling foreign affairs, so that the government can pay special attention to the affairs of its League of Nations membership. He also stated that Britain's foreign policy is based on its League of Nations membership, which should be clearly pointed out. Mr. Baldwin then reiterated the main points of his speech in Worcestershire. He concluded, "I wish the spirit of unity to continue unwaveringly, so that our country can consolidate and maintain its leading position in the trend towards world prosperity, world freedom, world peace, and progress." (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) Today, new Prime Minister Baldwin, in his first speech in Worcestershire after taking office, stated the current situation at home and abroad, saying that our responsibility to safeguard democracy and orderly freedom is greater than that of any country in the world today. He praised the achievements of the former Prime Minister. He went on to praise the achievements of former Prime Minister MacDonald during his tenure. He had worked with MacDonald for several years, and they would continue to have close relations. He dared to say that a partisan government could never have achieved what a government of national unity had achieved in the past four years. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Simultaneous Consideration of National Defense and Security</p>
<p>Mr. Baldwin then mentioned the issue of national defense and collective security systems, saying that the current situation in Europe is precarious, which you all know well and need not be elaborated. However, the government's duty is to state frankly that Britain's defense equipment cannot be perfected until international arms limitations are implemented. On the one hand, we must defend our country, and on the other hand, we must promote a collective security system. However, if our own strength is insufficient, advocating a collective security system will not have a corresponding effect. We are fighting for arms limitations in Geneva, and at the same time, we are not neglecting our own security. The reason is this: In short, the purpose of our British policy is to seek peace for other countries and for our own people, and to seek security for our own people and for the people of Europe. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>Democracy is Better Than Dictatorship</p>
<p>He then elaborated on the political positions of major countries such as Italy, Russia, Germany, the United States, and France, saying that the great democratic countries that can enjoy the blessings of security are Britain (cheers). He then discussed the dictatorship system, saying that this system begins and ends with the period during which the dictator himself can maintain his power. The characteristic of the dictatorship system is the possibility of rapid and unexpected actions, which is often absent in democratic countries that adhere to the principles of a democratic constitution.</p>
<p>German Sky Armaments</p>
<p>He then mentioned Germany's sky armaments, saying that this move had been kept secret for a long time, but it was completed with two years of work.</p>
<p>Anxiety Over the Italian-Abyssinian Case</p>
<p>He then mentioned the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, saying that all countries in Europe are now uneasy about this. We are now suddenly encountering this kind of difficulty and possible danger. This matter makes it even more necessary for governments around the world to maintain their security and strength.</p>
<p>Strengthening Diplomatic Power</p>
<p>He then said that he had made changes to the administrative aspects of the Foreign Office to make it easier for Foreign Office personnel to handle affairs and to cooperate with the League of Nations more easily.</p>
<p>Progress in Domestic Industry</p>
<p>Finally, he mentioned the current situation in the country, saying that industrial recovery is progressing well. We still need cheap currency to benefit industry and reduce the cost of living. We are now enjoying the benefits of both. The unemployment problem is also showing signs of turning for the better. Old-line Conservative Party members are now worried that they will lose their party's prestige under the current government, but there is no need to worry. The National Liberal Party and the Labour Party have both given assurances that in the next presidential election, they intend to help Conservative Party members who are preparing to run for election to maintain their positions.

You must know that our problems must be solved by ourselves. As for the comments of foreigners, there is no need to pay any attention to them. Only we ourselves are the sole judge of national policy and the sole protector of the nation's future. When we establish a world empire, or when we have established it and maintain it, we must determine our actions ourselves and never consider the slightest bit of world opinion.

<p>Further Concluding a Cultural Agreement, the Two Slavic Nations Join Hands</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet-Czech mutual assistance treaty was signed today by Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov and Czech Foreign Minister Beneš. The Czech Foreign Minister is currently on a return visit to Moscow. An important clause in the treaty stipulates that the treaty will only take effect when the invaded country receives assistance from France. Other than that, the treaty is roughly the same as the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance treaty. The first three clauses are identical. (Reuters, 9th).</p>
<p>(Moscow) Czech Foreign Minister Beneš arrived here this morning and met with People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov at 3 p.m., beginning talks that lasted until 5 p.m. The discussion concerned the signing of a cultural agreement between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia. According to this agreement, the two sides will be able to hold art exhibitions and translate literary works, and establish procedures to protect copyrights. Litvinov held a banquet in the evening to welcome Beneš and gave a speech praising him, calling him "one of the most distinguished figures in the Czech and Slovak free movement, one of the founding fathers of Czechoslovakia, and one of the most forceful advocates of international cooperation to maintain peace. The recent conclusion of a mutual assistance treaty between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia is sufficient to confirm and consolidate the mutual friendship and the shared view of the two sides on appeasing Europe." He also said that while a certain country is now doing its best to oppose the collective security system, we must also do our best to uphold this system. "The friendship between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia has always been based on a spirit of mutual understanding and close cooperation. In the future, the development of economic and cultural relations between the two sides should still be guided by this spirit." Beneš replied in Russian that there was no difference in views between the two sides and that their common policy was a policy of maintaining peace. "My trip is also a prelude to increasingly close cooperation in this common policy," he said. Beneš is scheduled to visit the Moscow Kremlin district at 9:30 a.m. tomorrow and meet with Kalinin, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee, and Molotov, Chairman of the People's Committee. General Secretary of the Central Committee Stalin will also participate. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet newspapers welcomed the arrival of Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Beneš in Moscow and published his biography and photographs. Radek, in the Soviet Government Gazette, announced Beneš's outstanding position among the great bourgeois diplomats of post-war Europe. He continued, "Czechoslovakia is a post-war country that has played an important role in Central Europe, exceeding our expectations. German imperialism, under the fascist banner, demands to move south, threatening Czechoslovakia. The outposts of German fascism have been established within Czech territory and are joining hands with the enemies of independent Czechoslovakia. The Czech Republic is now facing a serious problem, namely, fighting to maintain its own survival. Beneš has played a leading role in seeing the good of the Soviet Union, and has made efforts to promote friendly relations between other countries and the Soviet Union. Therefore, Soviet citizens will warmly welcome him, because they know how to hate their enemies and respect their friends. The Soviet Union is not pursuing any aggression. It is only striving to maintain peace. It is sincerely pleased that it can be so friendly with the Czech Republic." (TASS, 8th)</p>

<p>Alameda, USA: The "Oriental Clipper" large aircraft, which will soon fly between San Francisco and Guangzhou, today conducted a "blind" landing test here. It will probably depart for Honolulu and Midway next Wednesday or Thursday. Today's "blind" landing meant that even eyewitnesses could not see that all the personnel in the aircraft could not see outside, because after the aircraft took off, the curtains were pulled down, completely isolating it from the outside world, except for a low-ranking person who could see outside. At this time, the aircraft flew out to sea for 150 miles, then turned back and landed at the original location. All driving targets relied entirely on wireless radio as a compass. The low-ranking lookout personnel were only for precautionary purposes and provided no assistance. It is reported that this test has shown that wireless guidance of aircraft is completely successful.

<p>Demand Increase to $1.29 Per Ounce and Request Treasury Secretary Explain the Reason for Silver Price Decline</p>
<p>(Washington) Democratic Senator McCarran has convened a meeting of Senate silver faction members today, Monday, to discuss methods of raising the price of silver to $1.29 per ounce. McCarran stated that the British are currently exerting efforts in various countries to promote opposition to the American silver purchasing policy. He has therefore sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, questioning whether the Treasury Department has directly or indirectly sold silver bullion from the Federal Stabilization Fund, and if so, the total amount and price. McCarran also requested the Treasury Secretary to explain the reason for the recent decline in silver prices and asked what methods the Treasury Department is currently employing to implement the congressional silver purchasing mandate. A passage in McCarran's letter reads, "There are widespread rumors in the world market that the United States will abandon its silver purchasing policy. This type of rumor is unfounded, and I firmly believe that you can inform the nation that the government is still earnestly implementing the silver purchasing law." (National News Agency dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Nevada Democratic Senator McCarran has convened a meeting of the silver bloc, hoping to relaunch a campaign to force silver prices to rise to $1.29 per ounce and to quell rumors that the Treasury Department intends to change its silver policy. The senator sent a lengthy letter to Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, requesting an explanation for the recent decline in silver prices and inquiring about the origins of rumors concerning the Treasury Department's actions. The timing of the silver bloc meeting has not yet been determined, but it is expected to take place within the next week if the Treasury Secretary responds to the letter. Meanwhile, Colorado Democratic Senator Adams and others believe that there is no need to relaunch a campaign to promote further silver purchases, and that the silver policy is progressing satisfactorily. New York news: Many brokers there believe that once Mexico releases its newly minted silver coins into the market, the trend of silver prices rising towards $1.29 per ounce may resume. They also stated that when Mexico encountered difficulties, the United States suddenly stopped raising silver prices, but Mexico urgently desires the rise in prices and only seeks temporary relief. Once Mexico circulates its new silver coins, it can sit back and watch silver prices rise steadily. Mexican authorities have apparently learned from well-informed sources that they must protect their minted coins, preventing silver prices from rising to at least $1.29 per ounce.

<p>Vatican City: Today, reliable sources here disclosed that Pope Pius IX is currently studying ways to improve the method of electing the Pope. The purpose of this reform is to unify the Catholic Church and the Eastern Church. It is said that the Pope has summoned experts from various denominations to express their opinions on how to enable the Eastern Church to directly participate in the election through its representatives. Therefore, bishops of the Eastern Church may also attend future episcopal conferences. This reform is generally regarded as a pioneering event in church history and an important step towards the unity of the Catholic Church and the Eastern Church.

I have decided to leave Hong Kong this afternoon on the Italian postal ship Conte Verde. I contracted a cold in March and have been ill for over a month. After quiet recuperation, I have gradually become more stable. My blood pressure is now about 170 degrees, but whenever my thoughts become a little complicated, I feel unwell. According to the doctors' examination, it is still necessary to recuperate in a different place. Therefore, I decided to take a short trip overseas. While there, I will examine the latest political and economic situations of various countries. When I will return home is currently undecided."

<h3 id="e38">Nanjing-Shanghai and Jiangnan Railways Changed to Connect Outside the City <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the project to connect the Nanjing-Shanghai and Jiangnan Railways, the Ministry of Interior submitted a proposal to requisition private land inside the city. The company later realized that connecting inside the city, although it could utilize the Nanjing City Small Railway, would require building bridges over the Qinhuai River and the moat, which would be very costly. It was decided to abandon the original plan and connect outside the city instead. The line will run northwest from the Yuhua Road terminal, along the foot of Yuhua Terrace Mountain to Honghuadi outside Tongji Gate, for the Jiangnan Railway. Then, from the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Bureau, a branch line will connect directly to Honghuadi near Yaohuamen. A transfer station will be set up in Honghuadi. The two railway bureaus are currently discussing this plan. The announced land requisition law for the city will be revoked after the route outside the city is determined. It is reported that funding has been secured for the lack of track construction costs for the Nanjing-Wuhu section. The Ministry of Railways and the Construction Committee guaranteed the issuance of 3 million company bonds for principal repayment. The company recently needed funds and paid 800,000 yuan in bond subscriptions in advance, pledging 600,000 yuan to the Shanghai Bank, which was also guaranteed by the Construction Committee and paid out immediately.

<p>While claiming not to interfere with Chinese schools registering with the Chinese government, they have issued a deadline for already registered schools to cancel their registration within three months.</p>
<p>Surabaya Correspondence: In mid-May, more than ten representatives of Chinese schools in Surabaya were summoned to the Political Department of the Police Department. They were received by Mr. de Vries, who first recorded the names of the attendees and the names of the schools they represented. He then asked the school representatives whether they had registered with the Chinese central government. Everyone replied that they had not. Mr. de Vries then announced the attitude of the Netherlands East Indies government on this matter. It was stated that because the Chinese government has regulations for registration matters, requiring that registered schools must teach Party principles and that their teachers must be members of the Party, and because the Kuomintang is a political organization while schools here are not allowed to be infiltrated by political elements, this point is considered to be conflicting. The government here does not refuse registration with the Chinese government for schools here, but any teachers who teach politics must be dismissed from their teaching positions and may be deported if necessary. Therefore, those who have already registered must cancel the original case with the Chinese registration authority within three months and submit evidence of the cancellation to the Political Department. Furthermore, while those present acknowledge that they have not registered with the Chinese government, if this is found to be the case in the future, all their rights may be forfeited. At that point, each attendee signed a document, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e73">An Account of an Inspection in the Northwest <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Geng Ya</p>
<p>Scenery along the Pinghan Railway and General Conditions in Ding County</p>
<p>To observe the work of the Chinese National Association of the Mass Education Movement in Ding County, Hebei, I transferred from Zhengzhou to the Pinghan Railway and boarded the evening express train northward. The train, coming from Hankou, originally had many empty seats, but when a university tour group boarded at Zhengzhou, it suddenly became crowded. The nimble male students were the first to board, invariably occupying two or three seats each, vying to offer seats to the female students. Some were busy elsewhere, trying to manage this or that, and for a time the sounds of laughter and singing almost completely drowned out the clatter of the wheels on the rails.</p>
<p>The train arrived at the Yellow River South Station and stopped to repair the locomotive. It started moving again after a long while, then passed through a tunnel about two li long. Immediately after exiting the tunnel was the Yellow River Railway Bridge. The train slowly crossed the bridge, and looking down, one could see the turbid waves surging into the sky, flowing eastward. The bridge is about six li long and originally had 103 arches, three of which were destroyed during the war. These were repaired by dismantling three arches from the side, so there are now exactly 100 arches. The insurance period has long expired. In the past, it took six or seven minutes to cross the bridge, but now it takes more than twenty minutes to avoid violent shaking and the danger of overturning. The bridge piers are about 15 meters deep, and in recent years the bridge foundations have been repeatedly eroded by floods. Especially during the great flood of 1931, the roots of the piers were almost exposed. The Railway Bureau urgently dumped large quantities of stones under each bridge pier to resist the force of the water. However, since so many stones were dumped, they formed a dam, and it was feared that the riverbed upstream would rise and cause flooding. Therefore, the Henan Provincial Government notified the Railway Bureau not to dump any more stones into the river. As for the funds for rebuilding the new bridge, the Railway Bureau had long been setting aside "depreciation fees" from its operating income on an annual basis, which had accumulated into a large sum. Construction should have started long ago, but unfortunately it was seized during the Zhili-Fengtian War, and again during the 1930 campaign. The designated funds have disappeared. Currently, only a foreign supervisor is hired to inspect the bridge once a month to verify whether it is safe for traffic, which is said to be very risky. Recently, the Ministry of Railways, together with the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, has surveyed the area slightly to the east of the original bridge to build a new bridge. The estimated cost is about twenty to thirty million yuan, and there are rumors of borrowing from the Economic Commission and the Boxer Indemnity Fund Committee.</p>
<p>Around three or four o'clock in the clear morning, the sky gradually brightened, and the train had already left Henan and entered Hebei. It passed Wanghuabao, north of Handan County, known locally as Huangliangmeng, where there is a Han Ancestral Temple. Someone recounted the local mythology, which was vivid and moving. Later, the train arrived at Xingtai (the old Shuncheng Prefecture seat, also the Julu where Zhang Zhou raised an army at the end of the Han Dynasty). There were tall smokestacks and electrical factories, and industry and commerce were relatively developed. Many people got on and off the train. Matouzhen burns coke in brick-built, open-air circular kilns arranged neatly in rows, like dozens of large vats buried underground. The fierce flames roared, and the heat was unbearable for even a moment. Shijiazhuang has many new-style buildings with red tiles and green bricks, tall buildings, and weeping willows, creating a pleasant scene. The area is where the Zhengtai Railway connects with the Pinghan Railway, and most of the goods entering and exiting Shanxi pass through here, so it is becoming increasingly prosperous. From here to Zhengding, Xinle, and all the way to the destination of Ding County, the fertile fields became increasingly vast. The distant mountains were verdant, and the new leaves on the wild trees were a beautiful sight all along the way.</p>
<p>Ding County is about sixty li wide from east to west and about ninety li long from north to south, with an area of ​​5,400 square li. There are more than 68,000 households and an estimated total population of about 400,000. The area is flat and without mountains, a plain with sandy soil. In terms of fertility, it is not the best. About 70% to 80% of all farmland relies on well water for irrigation, and dozens of hectares of rice paddies rely on ditch and river irrigation. According to a survey by the Mass Education Association, self-cultivating farmers account for 63%, self-cultivating and renting land account for 24%, self-cultivating and renting out land account for 5%, pure tenant farmers account for 5%, and others account for 3%. There are a total of more than 1.5 million mu of farmland. Households with less than 25 mu of land account for 63%, households with 25 to 49 mu account for 23%, households with 50 to 99 mu account for 6%, and households with more than 100 mu account for only 1%.</p>
<p>The main agricultural products are millet and wheat, followed by beans, sorghum, cotton, sweet potatoes, corn, peanuts, barley, and others. The production of cotton and peanuts has tended to increase in recent years. Industrial products include homespun cloth, reed mats, willow baskets, reed screens, zhaoli sieves, and other items. The main export goods are cotton, wheat, sesame, peanuts, Yali pears (Snowflake pears), dates, grapes, pigs, chicken eggs, Zhuang cloth, willow baskets, sesame oil, peanut oil, and eye medicine (known as Dingzhou eye medicine), with a total annual value of more than 3 million yuan. The major import goods are millet, foreign flour, sorghum, black beans, rice, coal, kerosene, matches, cigarettes, salt, porcelain, foreign cloth, foreign thread, paint, bicycles, medicines, decorations, and so on, with an annual value of more than 2.9 million yuan. Domestic goods account for about 2.4 million yuan, and the rest are foreign goods.</p>
<p>In terms of rural economy, there are about 68,000 farm households in the county. The total annual tax burden is more than 400,000 yuan. Farm households with debt account for 67% of the total, about 46,000 households. Among the farm households that borrow money, those with less than 20 mu of land account for 63%, those with 20 to 24 mu account for 24%, and those with more than 40 mu account for only 13%. The interest rate on loans is usually 2.5%, and sometimes as high as 5%. Cases of families having their entire property confiscated due to accumulated debt are heard of every year. There are about 2,000 beggars.</p>
<p>In terms of school education, there is the Provincial No. 9 Middle School, the County Normal School, the County Women's Normal School (the vocational school was closed last year), the attached elementary school of the Men's Normal School, the attached middle and elementary schools of the Women's Normal School, 21 township-run male higher elementary schools, 2 female higher elementary schools, 322 male primary schools, and 96 female primary schools. There are no less than several hundred mass schools and people's schools. Sixty-two percent of young people are illiterate, and 60% of school-age children are not in school. Among the 400,000 people in the county, 6,000 have graduated from higher elementary school, about 1,800 have graduated from junior high school, and 460 have graduated from university. In terms of health, there are about 450 doctors in the county, an average of one per village, and more than 400 pharmacies. Common diseases include eye, intestinal, stomach, sore, tuberculosis, infantile convulsions, throat, rash, and skin diseases. In recent years, the number of people addicted to white flour has been increasing, and it is being strictly prohibited. In terms of religion, there are about 7,000 Muslims, about 6,000 Catholics, and about 500 Christians. The general public worships idols, and those with secondary or higher education mostly do not believe in gods. There are about 1,000 temples in total. In terms of customs, early marriage is common. Men often marry before the age of sixteen, and women often marry before the age of eighteen. Most wives are older than their husbands. Girls under the age of sixteen no longer bind their feet. The people are more knowledgeable than in neighboring counties.</p>
<p>According to the conclusion of the survey by the Mass Education Association, it is believed that the county can represent the state of rural society in North China. The four major ills of ignorance, poverty, weakness, and selfishness are obvious. The majority of the people are still illiterate, have insufficient nutrition, are in a state of illness and weakness, and lack a public spirit. It is necessary to find ways to cultivate the people's intelligence, productivity, strength, solidarity, otherwise there is no foundation for rural construction. Therefore, in recent years, the Association's experimental work in Ding County has revealed four major areas of education and three major approaches, which is truly a prescription for the right disease.</p>
<h3 id="e74">The Situation in North China is Easing; Shang Zhen Takes Office in Tianjin and Discusses Troop Transfers and Stationing <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Beiping Dispatch. Thanks to the authorities' effective maintenance of public order, the public in Beiping and Tianjin is still calm, which is not as intense as rumors would suggest. The Hebei Provincial Government first moved from Tianjin to Baoding, and the entire move was completed today. The Hebei Provincial Party Department has also decided to move to Baoding. The files and documents of each department will be boxed up starting today (8th). The Pinghan Railway Bureau has agreed to allocate vehicles, and the first batch of files can be shipped tonight. The members of the Provincial Party Department have already set off yesterday. Staff members such as secretaries can all report to work in Baoding within three days. The Beiping Municipal Party Department is operating as usual.</p>
<p>Shang Zhen, the newly appointed garrison commander of Tianjin and acting mayor, delayed taking office after the central government announced his appointment, pending the promulgation of the organizational regulations for the garrison command by the central government, negotiating the command's expenses, and transferring garrison troops. After repeated urgings from all parties, Tianjin Mayor Zhang Ting'e sent his representative Liu Junming to Beiping to urge him to take office quickly. Shang said that the organizational regulations for the garrison command had been promulgated in Beiping, and all matters in Beiping had been prepared. This morning (8th) at about 7 o'clock, he received Liu Rongming at his private residence on Nanchang Street, and at about 9 o'clock, he went to Jurentang to meet with He Yingqin, the acting chairman of the Military Sub-Committee, to ask for instructions on taking office. He then dispatched his staff officer Guo Renfu, Fan Zheyuan, and guard captain Li Shaobai to lead a detachment of more than 50 adjutants and guards to Tianjin by train on the Beining Railway. In the afternoon at 3 o'clock, Shang Zhen and Liu Yunfang, the secretary-general of the 32nd Army, went to the East Station of Qianmen and boarded the train to Tianjin. Among those who came to the station to see him off were Bao Yulin, He Qigong, Wang Zhuoran, and Fu Zhang, more than 20 people. Before leaving, he issued the following statement to reporters. The security of Tianjin is a very important matter. I originally intended to take up the post of acting mayor and the post of garrison commander at the same time after arriving in Tianjin. However, due to time constraints, I will first go to the municipal government to consult with Mayor Zhang (Ting'e) and then take up the post of garrison commander. The garrison command will also be established at the same time. The 51st Army will be transferred, and the defense forces in Tanggu, Dagu, Yangliuqing, and Machang will be replaced by the 32nd Army. The two divisions of the army in Luzon have been designated to arrive by land within two days. The army headquarters will remain temporarily in Beiping, and Chief of Staff Fu Liping will remain in Beiping to preside over all matters. The Tianjin police are sufficient to maintain public order, and there is no need to station troops in the city. After I have completed all the arrangements in Tianjin, I will return to Beiping to visit Chairman He.</p>
<p>According to sources, Shang Zhen's old friend Wang Yitang went to Tianjin last night (7th) to liaise with all parties on behalf of Shang Zhen, along with Cao Rulin, a retired official in Tianjin. The results were smooth, so Shang Zhen went to Tianjin today and will report to the municipal government tomorrow without holding any ceremony. The date of the establishment of the garrison command will be determined after Shang Zhen arrives in Tianjin. The internal organization has been completely decided in Beiping. Chen Zikuan has been appointed as the chief of the military affairs department.</p>
<p>The Japanese military attaché to the Embassy, ​​Isoya Renjie, arrived in Tianjin from Shanghai the day before yesterday to convene a meeting of senior officers of the Japanese army stationed in Tianjin to discuss their views on the Hebei issue. Today, he and Sakai, the chief of staff of the Tianjin Garrison Headquarters, arrived in Beiping by train on the Beining Railway at 6:40 pm. After getting off the train, they went to the Fusang Hotel to stay and are scheduled to visit He Yingqin tonight to discuss the Hebei issue.</p>
<h3 id="e75">The Annihilation of the Red Bandits in Fujian and Jiangxi is Imminent; Peng Hu, a Fake Central Committee Member, Details the Reasons for the Failure <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch. Five hundred-plus people from the 19th Regiment and one part of the 12th Regiment of the Fake Fujian-Jiangxi Military Region were completely captured in Xianyou a month ago. Peng Hu, the Fake Political Commissar, submitted a detailed statement on the organization and reasons for the failure of the Fujian-Jiangxi Red Bandits while being held in the Fourth District Administrative Commissioner's Office. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Internal Situation of the Fake Organization</p>
<p>The original organization and armed situation in Fujian and Jiangxi, the Fujian-Jiangxi Military Region was originally directly under the command of the Fake Military Commission. After the National Army moved into Changting and Ruijin, a Central District was established in Ruijin, with Xiang Ying as the Fake Central District Commander and Political Commissar, and He Chang as the Fake Central District Political Department Director, governing six districts including Southern Jiangxi, Zhejiang and Fujian, Northern Fujian, and Western Fujian. Therefore, Fujian and Jiangxi were also under the jurisdiction of the Fake Central Government. The organization under the Fujian-Jiangxi Military Region includes the Headquarters, Political Department, Supply Department, and Health Department. The commander is the current surrendered Regiment Commander Song Yuanquan, the Political Commissar is Zhong Xunren, the Political Director is Peng Hu, the Supply Department Director is Xie Wu, the Health Department Director is He Chenke, and the Chief of Staff is Xu Jianghan. Under the Fujian-Jiangxi Military Region, there are three sub-districts. The first sub-district was originally in Guihua. After the 52nd Division of the National Army moved into Guihua, the first sub-district was abolished. The commander was Qiu Shangcong, and the Political Commissar was Wen Hanzhen. The second sub-district was in Anyuan. The commander was Wang Youcheng, who died in battle with the National Army in the Shicheng area. The Political Commissar was Xiao Mingxing. The third sub-district was in Hengjiang. The commander is unknown, and the Political Commissar was Liu Banghua.</p>
<p>Inability to Fight the Political Line</p>
<p>Regarding the political line, after the National Army achieved successive victories and the Communist bandits were increasingly annihilated, the Fake Central Government changed its line. This was instructed in December of last year. In February of this year, after the Fake Central District was wiped out, wireless communication was lost, and instructions could not be given. There was no contact with any party. Therefore, the current line is unknown. The Fujian-Jiangxi Military Region is currently implementing the line according to the previous instructions of the Fake Central District.</p>
<p>Guerrilla Tactics Failed to Achieve Results</p>
<p>The main point of this surrender is that the implementation of the political line instructed by the Fake Central District is fundamentally unworkable and counterproductive. Not only has it failed to maintain its own strength, but the number of personnel has decreased daily, halving in just three months. The independent teams are no different. The neighboring fake military regions, such as Southern Jiangxi and Zhejiang and Fujian, have been wiped out. In terms of replenishment, there is no source. The flexible guerrilla tactics were constantly surrounded and attacked by the army. For example, Minxi was defeated by the 52nd and 75th Divisions in Tangdi, Shaxi, and Yuanxi. This is because the people have all awakened, and no one reports any news. Everywhere is like being blind. From this point of view, the so-called nationwide counter-offensive is even more delusional and deceptive. (1) Material difficulties, with no source of origin. We brought only 10,000 yuan from the original treasury, and each person was given one jiao for food every day. It is now used up. Clothes and shoes have not been replenished. Sometimes there is no food for three or four days. (2) Reduced personnel, casualties in combat, and a large number of sick transfers. Not to mention fighting, even daily marching will be exhausted. Moreover, there is no source of supplies. (3) The people have awakened. Every time we arrive at a place, no man, woman, or child guides us. No one walks, and we cannot pass. We march only 20 li per day. In some places, the people use force to deal with us.</p>
<p>Seeking Survival Only Through Surrender</p>
<p>Based on the above-mentioned practical difficulties, annihilation is imminent. To implement communism is even more delusional. After repeated deliberation, we have realized our mistakes and are determined to turn over a new leaf and work for the Party and the country and for the benefit of the people on the road to the Three People's Principles. This time we could have all surrendered together, but Zhong Xunren, a Fake Central Committee member, Chen Changqing, the director of the Provincial Suppression Committee, and Yang Daoming, the chairman of the Provincial Government, opposed it and insisted on not coming. Therefore, we only brought a battalion. More will come later. The troops that came this time are the Fake 19th Regiment and two companies of the 12th Regiment, plus a direct company and a guard team, forming two battalions with more than 700 people and more than 400 guns. The military region has long been abolished. The troops remaining in Fujian and Jiangxi have no unified command. (June 8th)</p>
<h3 id="e76">Anhui Province Continues Work Relief <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The Investigation and Relief Office has moved from Anqing to Wuhu; first, the construction of the branch road from Wuxikou to Jiuhuashan</p>
<p>Wuhu Dispatch. The Anhui Investigation and Relief Office of the Shanghai Fundraising Association for Famine Relief in Various Provinces has been handling relief work in disaster areas since last winter, under the direction of the Venerable Hongsan. The winter and emergency relief have come to an end, but the severely affected areas are still in dire need of relief. Hongsan and the Shanghai General Association have agreed to allocate another 40,000 yuan for additional investigation and relief. To facilitate distribution, the Investigation and Relief Office has been moved from Anqing to Wuhu in recent days and has begun operations. The provincial government has issued orders to military and police agencies to assist in protection. However, according to on-the-ground investigations, the losses from the bandit and drought disasters in Anhui Province last year totaled 49 counties, with more than 8.7 million disaster victims, most of whom could not survive without relief. The tragedy of the disaster is beyond the imagination of those who have not experienced it firsthand. Therefore, it is believed that it is necessary to expand relief. Together with the Anhui Provincial Government Disaster Area Fundraising Committee and other agencies, comprehensive relief will be provided first. This is slightly different from the purpose of charity relief, which is to relieve the dead rather than the poor, but it is necessary to do so for the sake of the actual disaster situation. Personnel have been dispatched to the severely affected counties to conduct investigations and relief. After the relief funds were distributed, there were still twelve counties that had not benefited. Repeated requests were made to the General Association, and another 60,000 yuan was re-issued to carry out work relief. The counties are those that did not receive sufficient allocations from the previous emergency winter relief. The General Association has designated Xuancheng, Luan, Quanjiao, Chuxian, Jiaoan, Tianchang, Xuyi, Jiashan, and other eight counties. The amount of allocation has been determined. Regarding the implementation plan for work relief, the Anhui Construction Department has been contacted once. The principles stipulated are to construct water conservancy projects in the eight counties. The work relief funds total 60,000 yuan, of which 25,000 yuan were originally for purchasing seeds, but since the planting season has passed, they have also been transferred to work relief. The first step is to build the branch road from Wuxikou to Jiuhuashan on the Gutun Road, which is about 13 kilometers long. Jiuhuashan is a famous scenic area in the province, and about 300,000 to 400,000 people visit and burn incense there every year. The construction of this road will make transportation more convenient. The Anhui Construction Department has sent Section Chief Qi Qun to Wuhu to discuss this matter. As for the work relief in other counties, personnel will be sent to the counties to inspect and start work separately according to local needs and the situation of the disaster victims after consulting with the General Association in Shanghai.

<p>At about 1 am on the 5th, the home of Gao Disheng in Zhangze Fifteen Township was suddenly robbed by a dozen or so bandits armed with wooden sticks and three muzzle-loading guns. They searched wildly, injuring the owner and his two sons, Shuizhang and Yonglou. After the robbery, they fled towards the Jinshan County boundary in a chaotic clamor. It is reported that the loss of gold jewelry and beads amounted to as much as six or seven hundred yuan. The Public Security Bureau has been requested to order an arrest.</p>

<p>The Dasheng Third Factory in Changlezhen, Third District, experienced a strike on the 18th of last month due to layoffs and wage cuts. After officials from the Party and government agencies went to persuade them, work safely resumed on the 27th. However, yesterday (the 7th) at 6 pm, during the shift change between the day and night workers, a strike suddenly broke out. After the day workers left the factory, they remained gathered and refused to disperse. The night workers also stopped outside the factory and delayed entering. At the time, the noise was loud, the order was chaotic, and the situation was unusually heavy. Yuan Zhongqi, the chief of the labor department of the factory, came to the county to report the strike to the Party and government agencies. After receiving the report, the county government immediately dispatched more than 20 members of the security team in three cars to maintain order, and Xiao Shuen, a standing member of the county Party department, and Hu Yirong, the secretary of the county government, went to investigate the truth of the strike to determine how to handle it.</p>

<p>The county's Opium Prohibition Committee has already set a deadline for opium smokers to exchange their first phase opium cessation licenses for the second phase. Most of those who have complied are in the majority, but there are some who are cunningly watching and refusing to exchange them. They should be arrested and dealt with strictly in accordance with the law. According to reports from various license-chasing agencies, many opium smokers have already paid the fees but have not yet collected their second phase new licenses. Now, they are limited to collecting them from the original license-chasing agency before the 15th of this month. Those who fail to do so will have their licenses cancelled and will not be allowed to collect them, and they will be treated as private opium smokers without a license. A notice was issued yesterday, and all opium smokers are required to comply.</p>

It is reported that it has been scheduled to be held at 9 am on the 11th of this month in the auditorium of the Overseas Chinese Reception Center.</p>

<p>In the small street inside the South Gate of this county, shops are lined up and the population is dense. Suddenly, at about 1 am on the night of the 3rd, a fire broke out in the Chen Yongtai Grocery Store, burning down as many as thirty or forty shops on the east and west sides of the street. Chen, the owner of the store, and two employees of other shops, Zhuang Yaoxian and others were burned to death. Most people say that the fire was caused by an employee of the Chen store holding a lamp to catch mosquitoes, which caused the bed curtain to catch fire. The employee saw the disaster he had caused and fled in the middle of the night. Li Yushu, the president of the Jishui Association here, has dispatched Tong Runtin and others to investigate the households one by one, preparing to distribute emergency relief.</p>

<p>Since the great flood of 1931 caused disaster and displacement in the Eighth and Tenth Districts of this county, the vitality has not yet been restored. Suddenly, on May 11 of this year, strong winds, heavy rain, and hail fell, with the hail as large as a right block and as small as a chicken egg. Wheat ears and seedlings were almost completely destroyed, and many farmers' houses were damaged. The disaster area covered 16 townships and towns, and there were as many as 50,000 to 60,000 disaster victims. Not only is there no hope for the autumn harvest, and the people's food is worrying, but they are also eating in the wind and sleeping in the open, with nowhere to live. Old pain has not healed, and new disasters have struck again. Who is not suffering in such deep water? When the county government sent personnel to survey the area, they witnessed the disaster and felt heartbroken. The fields were full of hungry people, crying for food. In addition to temporarily accumulating and distributing seeds, other large amounts of money could not be planned to seek emergency relief. If they sit idly by at this time, not only will the disaster victims wait to die, but it is feared that it will affect public order. The county government has sent telegrams to the superiors, appealing for relief on their behalf, and has also sent telegrams to charitable organizations in Shanghai, soliciting donations separately. Once they are collected, they will be distributed immediately and a list will be created and announced.</p>

<p>The Huaiyuan, a tugboat of the Dongchang Wheel of the Zhentong Company coming from Tai, arrived outside Yimen at about 3 pm on the 8th. Suddenly, Wang Bian, (33 years old) who was selling salted duck eggs on the boat, accidentally fell into the water when crossing from the wheel to the tugboat. The wheel continued to travel straight away. After the surrounding masses caught a glimpse of this, they furiously shouted for the boat to stop, to no avail, causing public outrage, the boat was hit by hurled tiles and stones, only then stopping. The nearby paddle boat found and retrieved the body. The Public Security Fifth Precinct detained the head of the boat Wu Guangui, and transferred him to the Public Security Bureau. When relatives of the deceased arrived upon hearing news, a search of her person revealed two dollars and three cents of silver, two dimes of silver, dozens of copper coins, a silver hairpin, a pair of golden bracelets. Her brother has been notified and is en route to attend to her affairs.</p>

<p>Since the end of last month, the Zhanghui Central Theater has invited a Shanghai theatrical troupe to perform, and the business has been very prosperous, with seats often full. Unexpectedly, yesterday, hundreds of workers from Taizhou broke into the theater without buying tickets. When they were stopped by the ticket seller, a conflict broke out, and both sides used weapons. Knives and scissors flew everywhere, and the order was completely disrupted. The women and children in the audience desperately tried to escape, scrambling over each other, and cries for help were heard everywhere. Five employees in the theater were seriously injured, one of whom was on the verge of death, lying in a pool of blood. He died the following afternoon. The local security corps' prior suppression was ineffective. After the incident, they arrested the perpetrators A Er and A Mao, but the rest escaped.

<p>In Xinlin Zhou, a village in the eastern part of this county, a merchant named Zhou Qingzhen, who used to run a business in Shanghai, was known to be quite wealthy. However, in the past two years, his business failed, and he owed others as much as two to three thousand taels of silver. A few days ago, two banks in Shanghai suspended operations, and Zhou had deposited three to four thousand yuan on behalf of others. Upon receiving news from Shanghai on the 7th, he immediately became mentally deranged. That evening, he hanged himself in his room and died. His family rushed to rescue him upon hearing the news, but he had already passed away. He left behind a wife and five children, making it difficult for the family to make a living.</p>

<p>Remnants of bandits under the command of Su and Liu have been harassing the Zhejiang border. After our security team, along with tax police and local militias, intercepted them, the bandits dispersed into smaller groups and fled in disarray. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau, considering that the areas along the railway line, such as Jinhua, Changxi, and Longyou counties, although far from the bandits, are crucial to the safety of traveling passengers, has dispatched route protection teams to be stationed in various key locations for strict protection. Train schedules will remain normal.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Letter to the Editor <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>To the esteemed Editor of Your Esteemed Newspaper:</p>
<p>Regarding the news item published in your newspaper's Foreign Correspondence section on June 6th about the disappearance of the Director of Grain Collection in Haimen, after investigation, it has been determined that Cha Bingquan is not involved in any such situation. Furthermore, since assuming office, Mr. Cha has been diligent and selfless in his duties. It is believed that this is a misunderstanding based on rumors. The matter concerns reputation, and we fear it may mislead public opinion. Therefore, we are writing to request a correction.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted,</p>
<p>Yuan Bingquan, Head of Tax Collection, Hai Dou County</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor of Shen Bao:</p>
<p>Regarding the news item in your newspaper on the 9th about the drowning of a young girl from a coal boat in Wuxi, the reported details are completely inconsistent with the facts. After the incident, the relatives of the deceased, Lü Fuhai and Song Youming, along with the assistant manager of our company, Li Guoliang, stated the true cause of death as falling into the river due to a broken punting pole. The court-appointed prosecutor also recorded this information, and all parties signed the document, which is on file with the broken pole for verification. There was no collision between two boats.

<p>Qianye Association Managers' Meeting</p>
<p>The Qianye Association held a managers' meeting at its headquarters on Ningbo Road at 10 AM the day before yesterday. Managers from 55 member Qianzhuang attended. Qin Runqing chaired the meeting and reported on the details of the Ministry of Finance's allocation of 25 million in 24th-year financial bonds to relieve the Qianye industry and the establishment of the Qianye Supervision Committee. Subsequently, discussions were held on the fundamental solutions to relieve the Qianye industry. The issue of "splitting heads and adding water" was also mentioned. The meeting adjourned around 11 AM. According to a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency, "splitting heads and adding water" refers to the interbank lending rates between banks and Qianzhuang. The daily rates soared to a peak of 70 cents, and even then, they were insufficient to meet demand.</p>
<p>Qianye Pledges 1.5 Million in Cash</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance allocated 25 million in bonds to relieve the Qianye industry and established a Supervision Committee to manage it, a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency inquired at the committee yesterday. Yesterday was Sunday, and the committee was closed as usual. By the deadline the night before last, the total amount of bonds issued to Qianzhuang that had applied to the committee with collateral and passed the review was 2.6 million in face value. Discounted at 60%, this amounted to 1.56 million in national currency, all of which were underwritten by the Bank of China, the Central Bank, and the Bank of Communications. Today, the committee will continue to review the collateral of various Qianzhuang at the Ningbo Road Qianye United Reserve.</p>
<p>Ministry Directive for Suspended Banks and Qianzhuang</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance issued Directive No. 32, Shanghai Qianzi, stating: "Regarding the matter of issuing directives, this bank has declared a suspension of operations for liquidation. The savings deposits received should be fully liquidated and repaid within one month as ordered. Other debts should also be liquidated promptly and should not be deliberately delayed or opportunistically manipulated to the detriment of creditors' interests. Furthermore, prolonged delays should be avoided to prevent abuses and disputes, which would be contrary to the government's responsibility to protect people's property and maintain social credit. Therefore, the Ministry has specially stipulated six supervision and liquidation measures, set strict deadlines, and assigned personnel to supervise the liquidation. The aim is to ensure thorough liquidation and an early conclusion. In addition to assigning other supervision and liquidation personnel separately, this directive orders the bank to comply and not to disobey."</p>
<p>Minghua Shareholders' Meeting Yesterday Failed to Achieve Quorum</p>
<p>After Minghua Bank suspended operations, the shareholders' meeting was originally scheduled to be held at the Ningbo Association in Shanghai on Xizang Road at 2 PM yesterday. However, it failed to achieve the required quorum and was adjourned. The notice is recorded as follows: "Today, this bank convened an extraordinary shareholders' meeting. Only Yaoji and Chen Xifu, totaling 26 shares, came to the bank to collect admission tickets, which is less than the required quorum. According to regulations, the meeting cannot be held. Yesterday, we received Ministry of Finance Directive No. 32, Shanghai Qianzi (see above), and appointed Qiu Junzheng Lun as the supervision and liquidation officer. Therefore, we should wait quietly for the official supervision and liquidation. This is a notice." The bank's total shares are 27,500, and the shareholders who registered accounted for less than 1%.</p>
<p>Qingdao City Sends Representatives to Meet with Kong to Seek Instructions</p>

<p>According to the Shenshi News Agency, the International Labor Organization estimates that the global unemployment rate is approximately 25 million people, of which unemployed youth under the age of 25 account for a quarter, approximately 6 to 7 million people. The global unemployment statistics for January, February, and March of this year show better trends in most countries, but Belgium, France, Poland, and the Netherlands have increased compared to the same period last year. Bulgaria, Spain, and Yugoslavia have slightly increased. In March of this year, Denmark had 125,595 unemployed people, France had 544,567, Germany had 2,764,676, the United Kingdom had 2,285,463, Italy had 1,011,711, the Netherlands had 432,392, Sweden had 105,435, and the United States had 11,329,000 in January of this year.</p>
<p>ILO Discusses Relief: The current International Labor Conference, held in Geneva the day before yesterday, will specifically discuss this serious youth unemployment problem. Many countries have already taken various steps. The ILO believes that it is more appropriate to create recommendations than to formulate draft conventions for the youth unemployment problem. The ILO's relief plan focuses on creating technical schools and organizing vocational training centers within public employment agencies.</p>

<h3 id="e101">New Life Youth Service Corps Served and Advised at Tea Houses and Theaters Yesterday <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Correcting Obscene Lyrics and Vulgar Tunes to Purify Morals, Instructing the Public to Abide by the New Life Movement Regulations</p>
<p>Yesterday, the athletes of the Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association's Youth Service Corps provided service and advice at various tea houses and entertainment venues, corrected obscene lyrics and vulgar tunes, and instructed the public to abide by the regulations of the New Life Movement. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Mobilizing the Entire Corps for Service</p>
<p>Yesterday was a regular weekend holiday. The Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association's Youth Service Corps mobilized the entire city, making use of the rest time of staff from various agencies and students from various schools, to provide service. They all wore armbands with the words "Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association Youth Service Corps, District X, Team X" in white letters on a blue background. Each team consisted of two to ten people, holding the New Life Regulations, and went to various tea houses and entertainment venues to provide service. The police advisory teams of each district branch advised the public along the way, maintaining strict order and refreshing the city's appearance.</p>
<p>Correcting Vulgar Tunes to Purify Morals</p>
<p>For the sake of attracting public attention, public entertainment venues inevitably present obscene lyrics and vulgar tunes. However, such obscene lyrics and vulgar tunes have a very profound and negative impact on social morality. Their corruption and decadence are beyond compare. The New Life Movement Promotion Association has previously established regulations to ban them. Yesterday, the New Youth Service Corps specifically inspected public places such as entertainment venues and book markets in Nanshi and Zhabei, and corrected those who performed obscene lyrics and vulgar tunes in order to purify morals.</p>
<p>Instructing the Public to Abide by Regulations</p>
<p>Yesterday was a regular weekend holiday, and the public flocked to various entertainment venues and tea houses. The New Life Service Corps, fearing that the public would be unrestrained in entertainment venues, baring their arms and legs and indulging their desires, which would be detrimental to public decency, distributed the New Life Regulations at any time and provided detailed instructions on aspects of compliance with the regulations, so that the public's actions, whether in family life, office hours, or entertainment, would conform to the New Life Movement requirements in order to achieve a subtle and transformative effect.</p>

<p>Fenghua Association Members Enthusiastically Register Claims; Ningbo Association Discusses Assistance Measures; National Goods Company Employees Hope for Early Resumption</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, since the suspension of business at the Ningbo Industrial Bank and the Shanghai National Goods Company, related parties have been mobilizing to seek resumption of business. Calls for this have grown louder in recent days. The situation as of yesterday is detailed below:</p>
<p>Fenghua Association Handles Registration</p>
<p>Ningbo Industrial Bank creditors from Fenghua, in order to save on claim registration costs, have specifically requested the Fenghua Association to handle registration on their behalf without charge. The claim certificates will still be retained by the creditors. Mr. Chen Zhongmou of the association told reporters yesterday that the association's registration procedure is swift and economical, so those who go to register are very enthusiastic. As of last night, there were already more than five hundred households, totaling more than 200,000 yuan in claims. In order to expedite the conclusion of the matter, the registration procedure will be limited to the 16th of this month, after which the association will not be responsible. It is said that the bank has received the assistance of powerful gentlemen of commerce at sea and is expected to resume business.</p>
<p>Yong (Ningbo) Association Discusses Assistance</p>
<p>The Ningbo Association on Xizang Road in this city, feeling that Mr. Wu Zhihao cherishes the national goods enterprise, unfortunately suffered a setback due to market influences, causing his life's work to suffer a setback. The association, based on hometown ties, originally intended to step in to maintain it. Also, because Ren Jinpin and the Fenghua Association earnestly requested assistance from the association, they convened powerful fellow villagers in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m., including Yu Zuoting, Yu Qiaqing, Jin Tingsun, Zhang Shenzhi, etc., at the association's meeting room to discuss assistance measures.</p>
<p>National Goods Company Resumption Movement</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Company Unemployed Employees Relief Association is also vigorously seeking the company's resumption of business and held its third representative meeting yesterday morning. Twenty-one representatives attended and resolved four items: (1) Whether members of the association should register with the company's appointed liquidation lawyer was resolved to be reserved until before the 14th. (2) The association members' food issue should be effectively resolved, and it was resolved to send Cai Juntang and Wu Dejin as representatives to contact Mr. Jiang Shengru again and effectively resolve it.

<p>From Hangzhou to Huangshan in Just Nine Hours and Fifty-Two Minutes</p>
<p>Huangshan Mountain in Anhui Province is famous for its secluded scenery and magnificent wonders, especially the pine trees and rocks. Since the establishment of the Huangshan Construction Committee, it has been working hard on various construction projects with grand plans. The designated first phase of leasing land has been enthusiastically embraced by tenants, with a surge in applications. The number of tourists is also increasing daily. The mountain has become very convenient to reach due to the completion of the Hangzhou-Huizhou Highway. The Shexian-Yixian Long-Distance Bus Company operates daily round trips from Hangzhou to Shexian County, taking only seven hours and two minutes, with a fare of 6.08 yuan. From June 1st, the company will add buses from Shexian County to Huangshan to facilitate tourists, with one bus at 10 a.m. and one bus in the afternoon, taking only one hour and fifty minutes, with a fare of 1.90 yuan. It takes a total of nine hours and fifty-two minutes to reach Huangshan from Hangzhou, with a fare of only 7.98 yuan. If you go from Shanghai, you can take the Shanghai-Hangzhou train at 6:50 p.m. to Hangzhou, and then take the long-distance bus on the Hangzhou-Huizhou Road directly to Huangshan the next morning. When returning to Shanghai from Huangshan, you can arrive that night. The construction committee's office in Shanghai receives daily reports from the office on the mountain that the vicinity of the mountain is very peaceful. Tourists from various provinces are seen everywhere, like a never-ending stream on the Shanyin Road. As the summer vacation approaches, the number of tourists going to the mountain will be even more enthusiastic.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Promotion of National Goods Association Proves Qingsheng Ramie Scarf is National Good <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a Special Letter was Sent to the Hankou National Goods Movement Association to Explain the Misunderstanding and Request Protection</p>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Promotion of National Goods Association, regarding the incident where the Qingsheng Silk Scarf Factory participated in the Hankou China National Goods Market and a dispute arose over non-national goods ramie scarves, sent a special letter to the Hankou City National Goods Movement Committee yesterday to explain the misunderstanding and request protection. The original letter is recorded below: Sirs, regarding the letter from our association member Qingsheng Silk Scarf Factory stating that the Hankou China National Goods Market was established, and our factory participated in the handkerchief department, selling silk gauze scarves and also ramie scarves. According to the representative's report, the Hankou City National Goods Movement Committee misunderstood the products, thinking they were foreign goods posing as national goods, and decided to impose penalties, etc. After reading it, we were extremely shocked. The silk gauze handkerchiefs are made by our factory. The ramie scarves were purchased from Shunli Scarf Factory at No. 110 Rongqing Lane, Jessfield Road, this city, in two batches on January 18th and April 4th, one hundred dozen small ramie scarves. In this batch of ramie scarf boxes, there were more than a dozen that were printed with words such as "Made in England Zengyu Yanghang." Because of long-term dealings and good reputation, we did not inspect them and shipped them to Hankou for sale, which led to the Hankou City National Goods Movement Committee pointing out that they were foreign goods. It was unexpected. Guo Liang went to the factory to inquire about the truth. According to Mr. Wu Wenqing, the owner of the factory, the fine yarn cloth for the ramie scarves is rarely produced in our country, so we had to purchase foreign goods for use. They are made by our Chinese people, according to the Ministry of Industry's national goods standard as seventh-class products. Also, there is no Zengyu Yanghang among British merchants. It is actually a fictitious name. Based on the facts, our factory has no suspicion of posing as national goods. However, the crime of negligence is undeniable. However, we are a small business and are in a time of commercial depression. We have suffered this innocence and are deeply pained. Therefore, we specifically clarify the facts and request your association to send personnel to conduct an on-site investigation, uphold justice, and provide relief to rescue the innocent and protect national goods. Also, according to Mr. Ding Zifu, the factory's representative in Hankou, who came to the association to report on the situation, the factory's silk scarves are indeed self-made, and they also sell ramie handkerchiefs produced by Shunli. The raw materials are indeed foreign goods, and there is no substitute for national goods. They are in accordance with the Ministry of Industry's national goods standard, seventh-class. As for the words "Made in England" and "Zengyu Yanghang" on the paper box, they are completely fictitious in order to cater to the Chinese people's fascination with foreign goods in order to increase sales and earn more petty profits. According to the facts, Shunli clearly used foreign goods to impersonate national goods, and the Qingsheng factory had no suspicion of selling foreign goods, but the negligence in inspection caused suspicion, which is difficult to absolve. Compared with intentionally posing as national goods, it should also be forgiven. Now, according to the previous situation, it was submitted to the 29th regular meeting of the 14th session of our association and resolved to send a special letter to the Hankou City National Goods Movement Association to resolve the misunderstanding and exempt it from disciplinary records. In addition to writing to the Hankou China National Goods Market to clarify the matter and order the factory to withdraw the ramie scarves from display, we are writing to inform you, hoping that your association will investigate and handle the matter, exempt the innocent from trouble, and relieve commercial difficulties. We also hope to hear from you.</p>

<p>Instructing All Shipping Companies to Give Priority to Employment; Seafarer Certifications Expiring at the End of This Month</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Merchant Ship Officers Association stated that since China's opening to the sea, many merchant ship officers were initially hired from abroad. This was because our country lacked nautical talents and had no choice but to borrow talents from foreign countries, resulting in the loss of sovereignty and the outflow of benefits. However, in recent years, the country has spared no effort in cultivating naval talents, and the number of graduates from merchant shipping and fisheries schools, as well as those who have trained on merchant ships for many years, is considerable, enough to be assigned to various ships. Therefore, under the current circumstances, there is no need to use foreigners. For this reason, the above reasons were presented to the Ministry of Communications some time ago, requesting approval to instruct the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau that the employment of seafarers by the company should be based on certificates, and that seafarers with certificates should be given priority to employment by nationals. If so, unemployed national seafarers with certificates can be relieved, and the country's maritime rights can be gradually recovered. After the Ministry of Communications reviewed the report, it has instructed the Maritime Affairs Bureau to handle the matter. It is reported that the director of the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau has received the order and will issue a circular to all merchant ship companies today to inform them, and the third extension of the seafarer certification will also expire at the end of this month and will not be extended again.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Host Flees Mid-Banquet: Guests Suffer After Pigging Out <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Restaurant Accountant Didn’t Know the Host; Guests Sentenced to Two Months’ Detention by the Court</p>
<p>Cheng Genbao and Cheng Sanbao, brothers from Nanhui, were both shoemakers. Recently, they both lost their jobs and experienced economic panic. Suddenly, they had a whimsical idea: using the excuse of their father's sixtieth birthday, they sent out invitations and held a banquet at the Danfeng Restaurant in Ximen, claiming to offer congratulations. Guests arrived one after another, opening four tables of wine and food, as well as a hall meeting for Cheng Changgen (with a fixed price of seven yuan for the performance). As the guests were enjoying themselves, Cheng Genbao and Cheng Sanbao took the opportunity to abscond with the gifts of silver dollars, disappearing without a trace. The guests turned around and found that the host had suddenly disappeared. Knowing that something was wrong, they left in a hurry without finishing their meal. Only Shi A'da (49 years old, from Nanhui) and Jin Fugen (24 years old, from Ningbo) were still gorging themselves. Shao Zaihang, the accountant of the restaurant, and Cheng Changgen hurriedly asked Shi A'da and others where the host had gone. At this point, Shi and others seemed to wake up from a dream, opening their eyes and not knowing what to say. Their awkwardness was fully revealed, and their situation made onlookers laugh. So, they called the police and had Shi A'da and Jin Fugen arrested and taken to the police station, and then transferred to the local court. Prosecutor Lei Binzhang questioned the defendants and found that they were clearly in cahoots with the escaped Cheng Genbao and others. There was no way to deny the charges, so he filed a public prosecution. In the trial a few days ago, the court recognized that the defendants were the people in charge at the scene, and although the crime was indeed excusable, Shi A'da and Jin Fugen were each sentenced to two months in prison as a warning.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Shanghai Municipal Council's New Central Police Station Completed; Yesterday, Guests from All Walks of Life Were Invited to Visit <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession previously considered the building of the Central Police Station on Fuzhou Road to be dilapidated, the site to be small, and the application to be insufficient. Therefore, it allocated huge funds to build an eight-story building over 100 feet high on the south side of the old site. The building covers an area of more than three mu and adopts the latest designs and equipment to provide full convenience for the police officers of the Public Concession and to seek to improve the police service. The new building was completed a month ago, and all the staff of the police department moved in on the 1st of this month. The old building on the corner of Fuzhou Road and Henan Road will be taken over by the Henan Road Fire Brigade for expansion. At 2 p.m. yesterday, in order to let Chinese and foreign people understand the internal situation of the new building, the department specially invited all sectors of this city to visit, sending out 1,500 invitations, and prepared tea and refreshments to entertain the guests. Yesterday was a Sunday, and most of the staff did not work. All departments allowed guests to visit freely and did not disperse until about 5 p.m. The Central News Agency reporter especially visited the internal situation and recorded it as follows:</p>
<p>General Internal Arrangement</p>
<p>The new Central Police Station is located between Fuzhou Road, Henan Road, and Jiangxi Road, facing north and sitting south. It is an eight-story steel-concrete building, shaped like the Chinese character "口." Cars can drive directly into the central parking square through the central gate. The ground floor along Fuzhou Road is the office of the assistant police commissioner (administrative affairs) and the vehicle affairs office. The first floor is the office of the deputy police commissioner (training armed reserve forces) and the assistant police commissioner (managing Chinese detectives and Indian detectives). The second floor is the office of the chief of District A, the chief of detectives of District A, and the assistant police commissioner (managing Japanese detectives). The third floor is the place for issuing firearm licenses, the payment office, the detective inspector of the general patrol station, and the office of the dormitory affairs office. The fourth floor is the office of the police commissioner, the assistant police commissioner, the deputy police commissioner (in charge of various district affairs, Japanese detectives, and Chinese detectives), and the deputy police commissioner (criminal affairs). The fifth floor is the office of the assistant police commissioner, as well as the fingerprint section and the criminal case file room. The sixth floor is the office of the deputy police commissioner (special affairs), the photography room, and the exhibition room. The seventh floor is the police officers' club. The eighth floor is the radio station and telephone room. The ground floor of the southern building is the police car parking area. The first floor is the armory. The second floor is the office of the Chinese and foreign detectives. The third floor and above are the dormitories for Western police officers. The ground floors of the eastern and western buildings are parking spaces. The second floor is the kitchen and dining room. The third floor and above: the eastern part is the dormitory for Chinese detectives, and the western part is the dormitory for Indian detectives. The interrogation room and detention center are located on the first floor of the southern and eastern parts, side by side.</p>
<p>Statistics of Chinese and Western Personnel</p>
<p>According to the latest statistics, there are a total of 5,123 internal and external staff members of the Public Concession Police Department, of which 485 are Westerners and 3,675 are Chinese (648 are Indians and 315 are Japanese).</p>
<p>Complete Equipment in All Departments</p>
<p>Looking at all departments, in addition to the grand scale and complete equipment, the distribution of various offices is appropriate. In terms of preserving documents and files, it is quite orderly. Important documents have a special room and are placed in more than 2,000 safes for preservation. The case files of each department are also strictly compiled and organized.</p>
<p>Vehicle Statistics</p>
<p>The police department pays great attention to statistics. For example, in terms of vehicle affairs, regarding car accident incidents, there is a daily record board in the office, recording the number of car accidents last year and this year. According to the record on the board yesterday, the total number of car accidents last year was 13,557, and last year's month was 1,172. The total number of deaths was 120, and the number of injuries was 4,462. The total number from this year to May 8 was 4,233, and this month was 175. From this year to May 8, there were 42 deaths and 1,655 injuries. The organization of driver's licenses in the office is also impressive. It is said that there are about 20,000 cars in Shanghai, of which about one-third of the compulsory driver's licenses are issued by the French Concession Police Department, and two-thirds are issued by the Public Concession. A total of more than 18,000 vehicle licenses have been issued.</p>
<p>Progress in Fingerprint Research</p>
<p>The study of fingerprints of criminal offenders has long been valued by police authorities in various countries. The Public Concession Police Department is now also catching up, and has specially assigned 8 Westerners and 18 Chinese to manage the matter. At present, the fingerprint section has retained 320,000 fingerprints. In the past few years, the average number of fingerprints was only 70 to 80 per day. In recent years, due to the economic recession, criminal cases have increased considerably, so the average number to date is more than 100 per day (the highest record was 260, during last year's rickshaw pullers' strike). If a criminal has left his fingerprints in the police station, the section can find them within two or three minutes after the re-offense, or at the latest, no more than five or six minutes. The section starts working at 6 a.m. every day, because the Special District Court must submit the fingerprints of the criminals obtained the night before for review when hearing criminal cases in the morning. According to the person in charge of the section, most of the fingerprints are from thieves and prostitutes. In recent days, there have been more prostitutes' fingerprints because of the joint efforts of the various business associations to crack down on prostitutes soliciting customers along the road. It is also said that the ratio of men to women in fingerprints is four to one, which makes people feel horrified at the large number of female criminals in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Confiscated Criminal Goods</p>
<p>The photography room and the exhibition room are also quite interesting to visitors. The photographs taken in the photography room are mostly criminals and the work of enlarging fingerprints can be completed in the shortest possible time. The exhibition room is nothing less than a museum of criminal cases, such as various unusual weapons used for assassination, counterfeit banknotes, counterfeit coins, fake pistols, smoking sets, red pills, manufacturing equipment, gambling equipment, models and bottom plates of counterfeit coins and banknotes, various pistols, rifles, and glass fake pistols, the Communist Party's red flags, and anti-imperialist propaganda slogans, etc. The strangest thing is that there is an eight-inch photograph signed by Chen Ying-shi, which is also prominently hung on the wall, but it is unknown why it is displayed here.</p>
<p>Wireless Station on the Roof</p>
<p>A wireless station is set up on the roof, with a power of 1,000 watts and a call sign of XSMP. This radio station is specially designed to assist in police affairs. If a theft occurs in a certain place, once the police station is notified by telegram, the radio station will broadcast to the police cars patrolling the roads, so that they can immediately drive to the scene of the incident and engage in the arrest or guard. The telephone room is located in the room next to the radio station, with 14 main lines and about 200 sub-machines.</p>
<p>Police Officers' Club</p>
<p>The police officers' club has a billiard room, a bar, a coffee room, and a library, as well as a small dance hall for emergency needs. The hygiene and fire protection equipment on each floor are also quite complete and thoughtful.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Abdomen Bulges: Eight Packets of Morphine Found <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Li Yuming Handed Over to the Bureau for Legal Action</p>
<p>Jing Fa Dianchen, a police officer from post No. 48 of the Ximen Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, saw a person with a bulging abdomen and sneaking around while on duty at Xieshi Road in Nanshi at about 2 p.m. the day before yesterday. Knowing that it was not an ordinary person, he checked him and found eight small packets of morphine on him. He then brought the person and the witness to the station. After interrogation by the station, he was transferred to the Ximen Branch for handling. Li, the director of the branch, instructed the bureau member Fu Yuejia to summon the case yesterday morning. According to the suspect's confession, "Li Yuming, a native of Tianjin, 39 years old, lives at No. 14 Zhizaoju Road, Nanshi, and is a chef. This morphine was given to me by a friend named Jin, who lives in the thatched house in Laoyingpan, at about 12 p.m. yesterday, asking me to go to Jin's friend's place on Mali Teacher Road in the Public Concession to pick it up and bring it back to Laoyingpan to Jin. Unexpectedly, I was searched by the police while passing Xietu Road." After Li, the director of the branch, verified the confession, he handed it over to Shen Wenda, the detective team leader of the branch, for investigation. He immediately sent personnel to escort the suspect Li to the above-mentioned thatched house in Laoyingpan, accompanied by Jing Hanong, police officer No. 48, to arrest him, but the suspect Jin was well-informed and had already fled. Only the suspect Li Mengshi was arrested and taken to the bureau. Yesterday afternoon, a document was prepared and sent to the General Bureau for legal action.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Accused of Damaging Debt: Huang Xianyao Should Appear in Court <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>After the collapse of the Shanghai Daily Night Bank and the Great World Amusement Savings Department-affiliated Gongfa Company in the winter of 1930, a considerable debt remained. Although creditors had been paid 20% of the debt through liquidation and distribution, the matter remained unresolved for many years. Recently, creditor Wang Shaozeng, represented by lawyers Xu Yannian and others, filed a private prosecution with the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court against Huang Xianyao, the son of the deceased Huang Chu-Jiu, the general manager of Gongfa Company, and Huang Xianyao's father-in-law, Zhou Songqing, accusing the father-in-law and son-in-law of damaging debt and requesting a legal investigation. Despite repeated court summons, only Zhou appeared in court, while Huang Xianyao consistently evaded appearance. It was ordered that a warrant be issued for his arrest to investigate the matter. As reported previously, the Second Special Court held a continued hearing the other day, but Huang still failed to appear. Lawyers Wu Peng and Yang Yuan appeared on his behalf, stating that Huang Xianyao was not intentionally absent, but had genuine reasons for his non-appearance. Huang Xianyao was engaged in business outside, leaving early and returning late, with his mother managing all household affairs. Therefore, he was unaware of the police summons until he saw it reported in the newspaper. They argued that the promissory note for 100,000 yuan was found in the clothing chest of Zhou Xiuying (Zhou Songqing's daughter), Huang Xianyao's wife. They noted that Zhou Songqing had been the manager of Gongfa Company and was highly trusted by Huang Xianyao's father, Huang Chu-Jiu. They requested the court to simply have Zhou Songqing verify the handwriting, and if genuine, to render a judgment accordingly, stating that Huang Xianyao was not involved, as Huang Xianyao and Zhou Songqing were bound by their family relationship, which was the reason for his inability to appear. The lawyers for the plaintiff and Zhou Songqing stated that the case could not be clarified without Huang Xianyao's appearance. If he could not be arrested, they requested that a warrant be issued for his arrest for investigation. Zhou Songqing claimed that the promissory note was not issued by a businessman, but was fabricated by the plaintiff in collusion with Huang Xianyao and others. He stated that Huang Xianyao was engaged in improper activities, associating with disreputable people, and loitering all day long, requesting strict arrest and investigation. Lawyer Wu argued that even if the money were recovered, it would not benefit the creditors, and Huang Xianyao would not gain anything from it, so there could be no collusion. Judge Shu instructed that Huang Xianyao, the debtor in the case, must be brought to court and ordered a postponement of the hearing to June 16th, while continuing the strict search for Huang Xianyao for investigation.</p>

<p>Although Both Parties Reached a Settlement - The Police Have Already Filed a Public Prosecution - The Prosecution Cannot Be Withdrawn -</p>
<p>Mingfang Lao Si, a famous courtesan from Suzhou, over the age of twenty, had been operating out of Huile Lane on Fuzhou Road. Because of her eloquent speech and skill in entertaining, she was appreciated by two patrons. A local man named Qin Yanqing, who worked as a foreman at the Public Works Department Transport Office, frequented the pleasure quarters and indulged in song and dance. After meeting Mingfang Lao Si, he was smitten at first sight, regarding her as a celestial being. He would spend money on wine and lavish her with gifts almost every night. Over time, feelings grew, and Qin contemplated keeping her in a gilded cage. He discussed this with Lao Si, who felt that she had been through too much and that this was not a permanent situation. Having accumulated some savings over the years, she felt that choosing a respectable man would be acceptable. Therefore, she agreed to live with Qin unconditionally. They initially resided in a certain lane on Yunnan Road and later moved to No. 19 Pingliang Village, Pingliang Road. For two years, their relationship was harmonious, and Lao Si even changed her name to Wei Gengmei, also known as Wei Heying. However, this beautiful scene did not last, and trouble suddenly arose. In recent years, Qin Yanqing not only developed addictions but also had affairs, leading to frequent abuse. Their love deteriorated, and arguments erupted. Wei felt that it was impossible to continue living in such a situation. Therefore, around 4 PM on May 20th, Wei took her clothes and jewelry and left without saying goodbye, going directly to lawyer Jin Xinmin's office. Lawyer Jin sent a letter to Qin negotiating and published a statement on behalf of Ms. Wei Gengmei, severing her relationship with Qin Yanqing. The wording of the advertisement stated, "According to Ms. Wei, she lived with Qin Yanqing two years ago, hoping for a lifelong relationship. However, he recently had affairs and, after drinking, often abused her. Recently, he sent people to monitor her actions, depriving her of her freedom. Under these circumstances, it is difficult to continue living together. Therefore, she has entrusted this lawyer to declare that, from this day forward, she is severing her family relationship with Qin Yanqing, seeking the return of Gengmei's personal belongings, and requesting payment of living expenses, etc. In addition to sending a letter to Qin, we have also filed a lawsuit with the court and are publishing this notice." However, after Wei left, Qin Yanqing reported to the Huishan Police Station that she had absconded with his money. The police filed a public prosecution and issued a summons to the First Special Court, which was delivered to lawyer Jin to be passed on. The trial was scheduled for the previous morning. However, both parties realized that it was a misunderstanding and signed a settlement agreement at lawyer Jin's office. Qin also agreed to withdraw the lawsuit from the police. Therefore, when the case was heard the previous morning, neither the plaintiff nor the defendant appeared. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, began by presenting the case, and the defendant, Wei Gengmei's, defense lawyer, Jin Xinmin, stated that the case had been settled. The presiding judge, Qi Shengchao, stated that the police had filed the prosecution under Article 337 of the Criminal Law, which was not a crime that could be withdrawn based on a complaint. Therefore, he ruled that the case would be adjourned for seven days for further hearing.</p>

<p>Discussing Important Matters for Membership Recruitment - Special Representatives Have Now Departed to Different Regions</p>
<p>The Shanghai Student National Goods Promotion Federation has been actively conducting membership recruitment since it began, with excellent results. To facilitate the recruitment efforts of the team leaders of various schools, the federation hired special representatives to serve the teams in various districts. The ten representatives who have already departed are Ni Baiyan, Wang Zhixuan, Yang Zenghui, Ren Juchuan, Chen Xuezhe, Zhang Shusun, Pang Zhengzhi, Dong Qingyun, Wang Xielin, and Zhang Zai. The federation's school committee also held its fifth meeting at the Local Cooperation Association yesterday, recognizing the significant importance of membership recruitment for the future of national goods. Attendees included Pan Gongzhan, Shen Tongyi, Wu Rugui, Hu Wufeng, Feng Yixian, Pan Dingyuan, Jiang Menglin, Zhang Zhanbo, Huang Daping, Wang Dingcheng, Shen Ding, Gu Yinqian, Wang Zhongming, Chen Gonglu, Ni Wenya, Qian Shenzhi, Cai Xiaohe, Chen Naiwen, Xu Shushen, Shen Xibin, Chen Zhongfu, Lou Ziming, Wang Tongde, Jia Foru, Lin Meiyan, Huang Yan, Weng Guoxun, Cui Jianwu, Tao Guangchuan, and Cheng Kuanzheng. The board of directors was represented by Yang Weiyu, Yang Jiaoqi, and Zhu Changli. The meeting began with the election of Ni Wenya as chairman. After the formalities, committee director Tao Guangchuan arrived and took over as chairman, reporting on the purpose of the meeting. Yan Pan Gongzhan (representing Yang Weiyu) reported on (1) the progress of the federation's work, (2) the compilation of essays and mutual selections, which is currently being printed, (3) the recent situation of the membership recruitment, and (4) the details of the badge replacement with membership certificates. The discussion items were: 1. Should students, as natural members, be required to pay membership fees? It was resolved to waive the fees according to the regulations. 2. Should the badge fee of five cents still be collected according to the original plan? It was resolved that, since the badge was canceled due to the inability to source purely domestic products and replaced with membership certificates, the fee should be canceled and refunded to those who had already paid. 3. Should the phrase "hope" be added to the sentence in the membership recruitment charter that students are responsible for recruiting members to make it more lenient? It was resolved that the membership recruitment charter had already been decided by the board of directors, and the committee should not make any further changes. The word "hope" should not be added and should be handled in accordance with the regulations. Elementary school students should recruit at least one member, middle school students at least two, and university students at least three. 4. Should the reward system for those who contribute to the recruitment be slightly modified to encourage teachers and students from various schools to make extra efforts? It was resolved to suggest it to the board of directors. 5. Should a deadline be set for the end of the membership recruitment? It was resolved that the deadline would be June 30th. 6.

<h3 id="e116">Promoting Commercial Acceptance Drafts: City Chamber of Commerce Held a Lecture Yesterday <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Yang Yinpu, Zhang Naiqi, Xu Yongzuo, and Pan Rao Delivered Speeches - The Relationship Between Acceptance Drafts and Open Account Accounting Systems, etc.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce organized a lecture to promote commercial acceptance drafts. The second lecture was held yesterday at 9 AM in the chamber's hall. Experts Yang Yinpu, Zhang Naiqi, Xu Yongzuo, and Pan Yangyao delivered speeches. Over 300 representatives from various industries attended, and were received by chamber committee members Zheng Chengqing, Ma Shaoquan, and others. The meeting was opened by Luo Qinghua, deputy manager of the Silk Industry Bank, who stated that industry and commerce were in a severe depression, with bankruptcies and closures reported daily. The root cause was the lack of capital and tight credit, which led to falling prices and inventory accumulation, making it impossible to turn the economy around. The purpose of promoting acceptance drafts was to create payment instruments and increase the use of currency to alleviate the current state of terror. Since many people were likely still uninformed, a lecture was organized to learn from the experts. This was the second session, and they would hear speeches from Mr. Yang Yinpu, Mr. Zhang Naiqi, Mr. Xu Yongzuo, and Mr. Pan Yangyao.</p>
<p>Yang Yinpu Spoke on Shanghai Finance</p>
<p>Yang Yinpu spoke on the relationship between acceptance drafts and Shanghai finance. The outline was as follows: (1) The Meaning of Finance: A. Supply of Funds (lenders), B. Demand for Funds (due to lack of working capital in industry and commerce) (borrowers), C. Regulation of Funds: Financial institutions, where those with capital and financial institutions use each other to promote prosperity, and neither should be neglected. (2) The Current Situation of Shanghai Finance: A. The Root of Financial Problems: a. Cause: The impact of the U.S. silver policy, b. Root cause: The lack of a sound financial market, B. The Current Situation of Financial Tightness: Currency contraction, a. Legal tender contraction: The result of cash exports, b. Paper money contraction: Due to the decrease in cash, paper money cannot be issued, c. Credit contraction: Reduction in loans, real estate stagnation, C. The Impact of Currency Contraction: a. Domestically, prices fall and industry and commerce are depressed, b. Externally, foreign exchange rates rise and exports are hindered. (3) Acceptance Drafts and Shanghai Finance: A. Temporary Function: To increase the number of safe and liquid credit instruments on the market, increase the amount of capital on the market, and improve the current currency contraction phenomenon, B. Permanent Impact: a. Change the nature of borrowing and lending in the market, b. Create a key to control the market. (4) Conclusion: A. The common circulation of acceptance drafts can improve the phenomenon of currency contraction, B. The common circulation of acceptance drafts can increase the security of Shanghai finance, which is sufficient to encourage the supply of funds (benefiting depositors), and on the other hand, increase the liquidity of Shanghai finance, which is sufficient to regulate the demand for funds (benefiting those lacking capital). This is not only beneficial to the financial industry's own capital utilization, C. The implementation of rediscounting can increase the liquidity of general bank funds on the one hand, and increase the central bank's control over the market on the other. The financial organization itself will gradually become stable and will be able to assist industry and commerce as much as possible, as a legitimate means of development.</p>
<p>Zhang Naiqi Spoke on the Open Account System</p>
<p>Zhang Naiqi spoke on the relationship between acceptance drafts and the old open account system. The outline was as follows: (1) The Reasons for the Staleness of Industrial and Commercial Assets: A. Too much fixed assets and equipment costs, B. Too much inventory, C. Too many open accounts, the most important factor. (2) Commercial Acceptance Drafts Can Solve the Most Important Stagnant Factors: A. Converting book debt into documented rights, B. Turning documented rights into cash through rediscounting methods. (3) Commercial Acceptance Drafts Can Reduce Commodity Costs: a. Flexible capital turnover allows for more buying and selling, thereby reducing the burden of expenses, b. Financial institutions are willing to rediscount drafts at lower interest rates, also reducing the burden of interest. c. Reduced factory costs allow merchants to obtain cheaper goods, so promoting commercial acceptance drafts is beneficial to oneself. (4) The Reasons for Financial Institutions' Staleness of Assets: A. Too much real estate, B. Stagnant loans, one of the most important factors. (5) Analysis of Financial Institutions' Stagnant Loans: A. Unmatured book debt cannot be freely transferred to others to obtain financing, B. Matured loans cannot be repaid on time. (6) Rediscounting Drafts Can Solve the Stagnation of Loans: A. Rediscounted drafts are documented rights that can be transferred to the national bank through rediscounting methods to obtain financing, B. Rediscounted drafts are often transferred, and draft debtors, in order to maintain their credit, will not delay payment, C. Therefore, financial institutions are willing to rediscount drafts at lower interest rates.</p>
<p>Xu Yongzuo Spoke on the Accounting System</p>
<p>Xu Yongzuo spoke on the relationship between commercial acceptance drafts and accounting. The purpose of accounting is to accurately and clearly determine the value of assets, and their value lies in increasing liquidity. I am very pleased with the promotion of acceptance drafts. Please allow me to briefly explain. (1) The Accuracy of Commercial Acceptance Drafts and Accounting: Accounting values accuracy, and the promotion of commercial acceptance drafts will make accounting more accurate. Commercial acceptance drafts have a definite term, detailed records, and a definite amount. (a) The term of commercial open accounts can be determined, (b) The evidence of open accounts can be reliable, (c) The amount of open accounts can be accurate, and (d) Financial seasons can be adjusted without causing panic, and (e) Fraud can be prevented and disputes avoided. (2) Commercial Acceptance Drafts and Asset Liquidity: The first priority of asset organization is to seek a thick net asset. However, a thick net asset lacking liquidity is still not good for operation. Now, promoting commercial acceptance drafts can increase the liquidity of assets. Commercial acceptance drafts have turned book debt into documented debt, which can be transferred, rediscounted, and turned into cash, which helps increase the turnover rate of funds. (3) Points to Note in Accounting for the Use of Commercial Acceptance Drafts: Merchants in our country have historically been very negligent in recording drafts, often mixing them with business transactions and rolling cash. Now, with the promotion of commercial acceptance drafts, the recording of drafts cannot be as simple as before. The main book should have records of incoming drafts (i.e., accounts receivable) and outgoing drafts (i.e., accounts payable). The subsidiary book should have detailed records of the incoming draft book (or the incoming draft entry book) and the outgoing draft book (or the payment draft entry book), and there should also be additional records of potential debts and collection rights for endorsement transfers.</p>
<p>Pan Yangyao Spoke on Industrial and Commercial Self-Help</p>
<p>Pan Yangyao spoke on commercial acceptance drafts and industry and commerce. The main points were: (1) The current difficulties of industry and commerce are nothing more than the following: (1) Market shrinkage, (2) Heavy taxes, (3) Labor disputes, (4) Difficult collection of accounts, (5) Shortage of funds. Among these, items (1), (4), and (5) are particularly important to the survival of industry and commerce. Analyzing them further, items (1) and (4) are the causes, and item (5) is the result. Looking at the factories and stores that have closed down recently, they all had poor turnover, accumulated inventory, and excessive accounts, which were fatal blows. Last year, the United States implemented the Silver Purchase Act, and China's silver surplus reached 260 million yuan. Currency contraction caused banks to reduce loans and increase reserves as a means of preventing panic. Therefore, the bank loans that usually sustained industry and commerce suddenly became scarce, plunging them into the abyss of panic. (2) The biggest reason for the shortage of funds in industry and commerce is that our country's open account system cannot adapt to the needs of the new economic world, causing most of the funds to become stagnant book debt. (3) Promoting commercial acceptance drafts is sufficient to mobilize commercial funds. The simplest method is to try to turn the vacant book debt into circulating draft debt. The only way is to promote commercial acceptance drafts, because acceptance drafts are issued by the seller and sent to the buyer or its agent bank for acceptance. If the seller needs funds temporarily, it can apply to the bank for rediscounting, collect cash, or transfer it to others to replace cash. This kind of rolling circulation is equivalent to increasing the amount of capital on the market. (4) The benefits of promoting commercial acceptance drafts: Since the contraction policy of our country's financial sector is so severe and the need for funds in industry and commerce is so urgent, in this acute contradictory situation, industry and commerce can only try to solve this difficulty through their own efforts. Therefore, promoting commercial acceptance drafts is an effective tool for self-help in industry and commerce. Economists, financiers, and government authorities have jointly advocated for acceptance drafts, hoping that industry and commerce can honestly implement them to adapt to the needs of this era. If they can be promoted to the fullest extent, then in Shanghai alone, the daily transactions will be no less than tens of millions of yuan. The acceptance drafts issued based on this business can supply society with tens of millions of yuan of capital. We should still remember that during January and February of this year, industry and commerce suffered a great shortage of funds. Therefore, organizations such as the Industrial and Commercial Relief Alliance were formed to jointly appeal to the government and society, requesting the financial sector to continue lending as usual. After several months of fuss, a credit loan of 5 million yuan was reluctantly approved for consideration. Until now, there has been no news of any disbursement. It can be seen that in all difficulties, waiting for external relief is always difficult and unprofitable. It is better to ask for help from oneself than from others. If industry and commerce can make a great determination to improve themselves, starting with their own improvements, and first try to circulate tens of millions of yuan of book debt on the market, and strengthen the credit of acceptance drafts with human effort, then the financial sector may change its previous stingy attitude towards rediscounting loans, vying for fear of being too late. On this point, I can say with certainty that in any difficult situation, one must first devise countermeasures. If the progress is smooth, then one can hope for external assistance. Promoting acceptance drafts is a good way for industry and commerce to solve their own difficulties.</p>

Mr. Song also presented Mr. Li with a silver pagoda on behalf of the association. Finally, Mr. Li responded by saying, "I have just heard the praises of everyone and have been overly praised. I am very ashamed, but I will certainly keep them in mind and strive to repay you. I have been honored to serve as the chairman of the Insurance Industry Association for four years. During these four years, although the insurance industry in our country has experienced repeated incidents, it has still made systematic progress and has been highly valued by officials, merchants, and all walks of life across the country. As far as the association is concerned, although there are some achievements to report, this is due to the joint efforts of all members and executive committee members, the support and maintenance of the entire business community, the supervision and guidance of party and government officials, the assistance of the media, and the sincere cooperation of colleagues in the industry. I am truly grateful for this progress and dare not be complacent. As for this trip abroad, I originally wanted to absorb the air of overseas and use it as a rest. I also hoped to have the opportunity to study the social and economic conditions of various countries and examine the causes and coping methods of the various panics that various countries are currently feeling, as a help to our people. You are all discerning and I hope you can teach me. I am truly grateful and dare not accept the grand farewell party held by my colleagues in the insurance industry. I only hope to gain a little knowledge on this trip. When I return to the country soon, I will still follow in the footsteps of all of you. I am leaving in a hurry and have not been able to thank everyone individually. Please allow me to raise my glass and wish you all happiness." After Mr. Li's speech, a tea dance and photography were held, and the party ended at 6 PM with great joy.</p>

<p>Ms. Huang Xinmian dedicated herself to the women's movement for many years, founding "Women's Bookstore," "Women's Monthly," and "Women's Library," among others, which exhausted her physically and mentally.

<p>Mr. Yu Tinghui, chairman of the Shanghai Knitwear Trade Association, told reporters yesterday that the Ministry of Industry and the International Trade Bureau have been quite active in expanding the domestic market for national goods and promoting foreign trade. They have recently compiled and printed a directory of national goods export manufacturers for introduction from [unclear]. However, upon inspection, even goods of the same type in our country often exhibit slight variations. Therefore, to promote foreign trade, it is essential to first inspect domestic products to ensure standardization. Otherwise, how can we gain the trust of foreign customers? The Knitwear Trade Association will have an organization for a Committee for Inspection of Products of the Same Trade. Furthermore, promoting commercial acceptance bills is a crucial measure for regulating finance and is a necessary trend. The industry has already obtained agreement from all parties and plans to implement it starting July 1st. In short, in the face of an extremely sluggish market, we must rely on the unity and cooperation of all members of the industry.</p>

<p>Cao Chengduo, a 24-year-old youth from Ningbo, came to Shanghai from his native Ningbo to do business some years ago. Recently, due to the impact of the economic downturn, he became unemployed. Although he asked relatives and friends to help him find a job, he was ultimately unsuccessful. Having been unemployed for a long time, he tasted much suffering. Furthermore, he had no money, no place to stay, and drifted on the streets. He then conceived the idea of ​​ending his life. The day before yesterday, he went to room 309 of the Ningbo Merchants Hotel on Tianjin Road in the Public Concession, where he secretly ingested raw opium and went to bed. It was not until about 12:00 PM yesterday that a waiter discovered him and immediately reported it to the front desk, who in turn telephoned the relevant police station. Detectives were dispatched to investigate, and Cao was quickly sent to Renji Hospital for emergency treatment. Doctors diagnosed that he had indeed ingested opium, but the poisoning was too severe and there was no way to save him. He died shortly thereafter.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Record of the Case of Robbing a Coffin Lid and Extorting Money <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Song, the daughter-in-law of Chen Fengchun, a villager residing at No. 47 Nancaojiazhai, Caojiadu, West Shanghai, passed away from illness a few days ago. The next day (May 31st), the coffin was prepared for burial. However, members of the same clan, Chen Taosheng, Chen Qingzhang, and others, gathered a crowd to seize the coffin lid and hide it in the Yongkang Lane in the back. Chen Fengchun's wife, Chen Li, reported this to the police station, which dispatched officers to recover the coffin lid and arrest the Shandong men Zhu Xiaodi, Zhao Xinnian, Zhang Xianming, Zhao Baoshan, as well as Chen Taosheng and Chen Qingzhang, a total of six people, who were taken to the Caojiadu Police Station for interrogation and detention. It is now known that the cause of this incident stems from the fact that Chen Fengchun (60 years old this year) had only one son, Gou Di, who died six years ago. He married Zhu (the deceased) and had a granddaughter, Zhaodi, who is eleven years old this year, and a grandson, Longlong, who died at the age of five. Chen Fengchun was saddened by the death of his son and grandson, and in order to ensure the continuation of his lineage, he consulted with his wife, Chen Li (61 years old), two years ago and obtained her consent to take Fan (32 years old) as a concubine. Last year, she gave birth to a daughter, named Miaodi. Chen Fengchun owns a house and several acres of land, from which he can collect over a thousand yuan in rent each year, allowing him to live comfortably. This time, when his daughter-in-law Song passed away from dysentery, his cousin Chen Taosheng, his grand-nephew Chen Qingzhang, and others came forward to obstruct the [unclear] collection and extort two thousand gold coins without success. Therefore, they seized the coffin lid and instructed the Shandong strongmen Zhu Xiaodi, and others to guard it. At the time when the police arrested Zhu and others, they confiscated four iron bars (weapons prepared for resistance) and sent them to the local court for interrogation and detention along with the others. Yesterday afternoon, Prosecutor Wu Deying summoned Chen Li to the court for investigation. She recounted the previous events in detail. He then ordered the detained Chen Taosheng, Chen Qingzhang, and others to be interrogated strictly for a long time and ordered them to be returned to custody for further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Municipal Federation Requests Landlords in the 21st District to Reduce Rent <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The 21st District Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Citizens sent a letter yesterday to the property companies on Hankou and Shanxi Roads, stating: (Omitted above) This District of the Federation is located on Hankou and Shanxi Roads, a district known for its flourishing commerce. Since the January 28th Incident, the market has been in decline, and recently, shops have been closing down every day. The market is deserted, and travelers are reluctant to come. The reason for this is due to the slow business and the high rent, making it impossible to sustain operations. If this continues, the shops on these two roads will likely become mostly vacant. This Federation has received numerous letters from its members, stating that the social situation is not good and requesting that we find a way to provide relief. After deliberation, we believe that the prosperity or decline of businesses on these two roads is closely related to the issue of rent. If rent is low, shop owners will naturally try their best to maintain their businesses. If rent is high and business is slow, shop owners will be unable to maintain their businesses, resulting in rent arrears and closures. However, landlords will also suffer losses as a result. Although a small number of tenants are currently maintaining their businesses, they will eventually fail. We propose that landlords consider the social situation and, instead of leaving their properties vacant, consider reducing rent appropriately to prevent vacancies. This would allow shops to be lined up, and the market might recover as a result. Although landlords may lose a small amount of rent, they will avoid the loss of having vacant properties. The Company's properties are numerous within this Federation's District, and the number of vacant properties is also not small. Although the loss of rent may not be significant for the Company, the social situation should be addressed to help maintain the market and restore its past prosperity. These are the views of the members of this Federation, and we respectfully submit them for your consideration and adoption. (Omitted below)</p>

<p>The scenic West Lake is a place that one never tires of visiting, as each season has its own wonderful aspects. The hotel business has therefore risen up, and tall buildings line the lake. Although each may occasionally have a unique view or skill, few provide all the amenities for tourists. Recently, famous businessmen from Zhejiang and Shanghai raised funds to build the Dahua Hotel on Hubin Road. Since construction began, they have been working diligently, and it is now complete. It is only five or six minutes by car from the train station. The location is elegant, and the entire lake view can be seen from the upper floors. The architectural style and interior equipment are all exquisite and beautiful. The rooftop garden, open-air cinema, tennis court, dance hall, and fishing platform are all designed to provide guests with the best possible fitness. The auditorium is solemn and grand, and each bedroom has its own bathroom and is equipped with a telephone and radio. The furniture is all in the latest style. Chinese and Western cuisine is prepared by famous chefs, with excellent taste and presentation. The waiters have undergone rigorous training and pay special attention to service etiquette. The courtyard department is also responsible for hiring social workers who are familiar with local customs and speak politely. The hotel also has several of the latest model cars for pick-up and drop-off. Everything that can make guests comfortable has been considered. It is comparable to the best hotels in Shanghai and is a place where upper-class Chinese and Westerners can reside without having to own their own villas. It is reported that all preparations will be completed soon, and the grand opening will be held at the end of the lunar month. Commemorative books will be given to guests to add to the festivities.</p>

<p>The National Painting Monthly, published by the Chinese Painting Association and edited by He Dajian, the executive director of the association, has been increasing in sales since its publication, because the magazine is orthodox and the material is carefully selected. The seventh issue has now been published, containing articles by Xia Jingguan, Huang Binhong, Shi Chongpeng, Yu Jianhua, He Tianjian, and others. Xia's "Rise and Fall of Imperial Painting Academies Through the Dynasties" is a valuable textual research article. Shi's "Paintings in the London Chinese Art Exhibition" details the dimensions, inscriptions, brushwork, and ink of each painting, as well as biographies of the artists. Those who have not seen the pre-exhibition will feel as if they are there by reading this. Huang's "On Painting, One Should Take What Is Good" is the most insightful discourse. Illustrations include long scrolls by Zhou Lecun, Dong Qichang, Lu Hong, Song Shancao Zhang Tu, Bada Shanren, Wang Ai, and other famous works. The delay in the publication of this issue is said to be due to improvements in editing. It is published monthly, one issue per month, and retails for one silver dollar per issue. The annual subscription for twelve issues, including postage, is one yuan and two jiao.

<h3 id="e136">Emergency Meeting of Rent Reduction Association in Yuqing Lane, Tianliu Road <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Due to the economic downturn, the Rent Reduction Committee of Yuqing Lane, Laotangjia Lane, Datong Road in this city, previously sent a public letter to the landlord Zheng Zuoji on the 30th of last month, jointly signed and stamped by all the tenants of the lane, requesting a reduction in rent. This was reported in the previous issue. However, not only has there been no indication of rent reduction to date, but the landlord has also used high-pressure tactics, using the law as a shield, and filed a complaint with the First Court of the Special District on the 5th, suing six tenants of the lane: Wang Jinfeng, Shi Genjin, Ruitaiyuan, Li Jiaxiang, Gu Zhongzu, and Cao Zhenfan. After receiving the summons, the tenants reported to the association. After deliberation by the executive committee, it was decided that since the landlord disregarded the facts and the market situation, ignored the rent reduction issue, and instead sought to increase profits, using litigation as a weapon, the executive committee had no choice but to convene a temporary emergency meeting at the association's office in Lane 4 yesterday (9th) at 4:00 PM to discuss countermeasures. Over fifty tenants signed in and elected Yu Tingyang as chairman to preside over the meeting. The formalities were carried out, and the chairman reported on the purpose of the meeting and the progress of the rent reduction request. The lawyers Yu Chuanding and Zhang [unclear] were hired as legal advisors to handle legal matters. It was unanimously resolved that all rent in the lane would be deposited by the tenants and the rent reduction association in the Postal Savings Bureau. Rent would not be paid until the goal of rent reduction was achieved. The Rent Reduction General Association would also be notified and requested to provide assistance.</p>

<h3 id="e141">Arresting Souls to Support Bridge Piers <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Recently, it was reported that villagers in Shaoxing gathered a crowd of over a thousand to destroy the home of a certain Zhou, claiming that Zhou had organized a "Tongshan Society" to secretly investigate villagers' names, ages, and birthdates. Those investigated would have their souls captured to support the bridge piers of the Qian Tang River Bridge, which was then under construction. Why iron bridge piers necessarily require souls to support them, I truly don't understand. However, in my mere thirty-plus years of life, I've seen this kind of thing countless times. In the summer of the third year of the Republic of China (1914), a major disturbance erupted in the Zhe Dong area, known as the "School-Age Children Uprising." That spring, each county had been ordered to investigate school-age children. After midsummer, there was a drought everywhere, with no rain for three consecutive months, resulting in a very poor harvest. Coincidentally, in early autumn, World War I broke out, and Germans rushed back to their country. The construction of the iron bridge over the Caoe River suddenly stopped. Rumors then spread, saying that even the foreign devils were helpless with that iron bridge and needed to capture the souls of children to support the bridge piers. All the children who had been investigated in the spring were on the list to be captured. Thus, a major disturbance erupted, with attacks on schools, killings of investigators, burning of county offices, and the appearance of so-called "Infant Loving Armies." In families, there were even more tricks, including hiring Taoist priests, smearing dog blood, wearing seven-star coins, finding Hongwu Tongbao coins, and hanging fragrant sachets—everything imaginable. Following this came the government's busyness, sending troops, executing people, beheading people, posting announcements, and sending propagandists. Eventually, things disappeared without a trace and became quiet. In the eighteenth year of the Republic of China (1929), when the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Nanjing was under construction, Nanjing was filled with rumors of capturing souls to build the mausoleum. Children were again covered in yellow bags and seven-star coins. In the nineteenth year of the Republic of China (1930), there were rumors again in the Tai Lake area of capturing the souls of elementary school students to support bridge piers. Elementary schools in the Jiaxing and Huzhou area even had all students taking leave to return home. This time, the rumor in Shaoxing of capturing souls to support bridge piers is nothing more than a rerun of an old play, with different roles and locations. The origin of this kind of legend is very ancient. In the twenty-seventh year of the Kaiyuan era of the Tang Emperor Xuanzong, the Mingtang was rebuilt. Rumors spread that "officials are taking young children and burying them beneath the Mingtang to suppress evil. Children in villages and fields are hidden in valleys; the capital city is in turmoil." This shows that the legend from 1300 years ago is exactly the same as the current legend. Earlier legends than Kaiyuan include the legend of the Sui Emperor Yangdi capturing children to work on the Grand Canal; perhaps even earlier legends can be found.</p>
<p>The current legend of capturing souls in Shaoxing is slightly different from those in the past. In the past, it was consistently said to be capturing the souls of young children, but this time, it is the souls of women, children, the elderly, and the weak that are being captured, seemingly encompassing a much broader scope. Taoist philosophy, such as Lao-Zhuang, uses infants to symbolize the pure, uncarved innocence, the so-called "complete spirit." Later, honest people took the metaphors of intelligent people as actual facts. Thus, since the Han Dynasty, the cultivation of immortals has focused on infants: demons in caves treat young men and women as snacks; alchemists regard eating young boys' qi and virgin blood as medicinal ingredients. The Yellow Emperor ascended to heaven after copulating with eighty-one Su Nu, so old nuns in Suzhou and Master Duan of the Morality Society are searching everywhere for virgins, wanting to reach the perfect number of eighty-one. The methods may differ, but the principle is the same. The belief that major projects and constructions cannot succeed without using children to suppress evil is also a deduction from the same principle. However, the application of souls being extended to women, children, the elderly, and the weak seems a bit modernized and doesn't quite align with the theories of immortals. Moreover, with the people of Shaoxing promoting this, even middle-aged people like us feel a bit uneasy and apprehensive. I always feel that it's best not to expand the scope of employing souls!</p>
<h3 id="e142">Anecdotes from Medan <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Feier</p>
<p>As the train approached Medan Station, the "Temple of the Heavenly Queen," representing the beliefs of the Chinese, first came into the traveler's view with its ancient architectural style of red walls and pointed ridges. After getting off the train and walking past the Temple of the Heavenly Queen, the ancient bronze incense burner on the wide courtyard in front of the building was steadily emitting circles of smoke; a young woman wearing a sarong was inserting incense sticks into the incense burner. Upon entering the temple, on the right-hand wall, which was blackened by incense smoke, hung a bronze plaque engraved with the amounts donated by various wealthy people since the opening of Medan, starting with the Zhang family, as well as the names of the Chinese consular officials. Nearby, I also saw the "Guan Di Temple," which had a similar architectural style. The non-crude scale of these temples proclaimed that the power of the Chinese here was indeed great, and the deities here were enjoying "human" blessings, with the buildings being far grander than the "Bo Gong Palaces" and "San Bao Temples" scattered throughout the smaller ports. (Naturally, they could not compare to the "San Ling Temple" in Singapore or the "Kek Lok Si Temple" in Penang, which was all due to the control of human affairs.)</p>
<p>This spiritual burden represented the perseverance of the Chinese. (Or perhaps it was also the inferior side of the Chinese.) Relying on the blessings of the gods, the Chinese transformed wilderness into rich plains and turned harsh malaria-infested lands into paradises. Also relying on the blessings of the unseen gods, Medan was transformed from the hands of the Hakka Zhang family into the current city and became the capital of Sumatra Island. Unfortunately, the results of the labor were only harvested by others, and the Chinese only ate the leftovers of others. Medan has become a typical colonial city, and "San Bao Gong" and "Heavenly Queen, Guan Di" are no match for "Jesus, the Lord." Can gods urge people to build human culture, and can gods also protect their people from being bullied and confused by foreign races? In our corner of the world, will the overseas Chinese in Medan be able to free themselves from the intoxication of the gods amid the anti-Chinese voices and engage in human efforts?</p>
<p>In the center of Medan, the Chinese community leaders built the "Majoor's Residence." Stone lions stood in front of the gate, and the house diligently imitated the style of the residences of high-ranking officials and nobles in the imperial era. In this colony dominated by capitalist imperialism, the Chinese still retained the minds of the feudal era. A coolie, once he had obtained a relatively higher position through diligent labor and became a "Kapitan," felt joy in his heart and glory on his "face" that was just like that of the "scholar-official" class of the past. White people exploited this weakness, placing the "Majoors" and "Kapitans" under their control and assisting in colonial rule. There were many people from Fujian and Guangdong who served as guides for the Dutch, captured tribal settlements, and obtained the title of "Kapitan." After returning to their hometowns, they built solemn mansions and were called "So-and-So Sir," which was exactly the same situation.</p>
<p>Thinking about the grandson of Ye Lai in Kilongpo being forced to dedicate the territory and the King of Pontianak in Borneo (a Teochew person) being defeated by the Dutch due to lack of support, Java being filled with the "Red River," or groups of pioneers now being successively expelled back to their country, what will our thoughts be?</p>

<h3 id="e144">Life <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Xijun</p>
<p>The youthful season has warm, fragrant dreams and also colorful aspirations, but after being trampled by the iron hooves of reality, it is immediately shattered.</p>
<p>I fear the ferocious face of life more than I fear ghosts and demons; it always follows me closely, never leaving me for even a moment. I seem to hear its cold laughter from time to time beside me, making my pores stand on end like the chirping of night ghosts. I know that it is chasing me so closely because it wants to seize me when I am negligent for once in a thousand times of being careful; then it will pounce on me and swallow me like a snack.</p>
<p>Under the scrutiny of such an insidious and ruthless life, I lowered my head silently, straightened my chest, like a camel, a cart, shouldering a heavy load of thousands of pounds, letting its whip beat me incessantly, driving me forward on a long, hazy, endless journey, regardless of day or night, from today to tomorrow, eternally trudging forward, sweating and panting. I cannot easily see the light of the sun, because even in the daytime, the space is still filled with thick fog; at night, there is no moon or stars in the sky, only the desolate wind is howling, and surrounding my body are layers of shadows. I crawl in the impenetrable shadows because I am already exhausted.</p>
<p>However, life will not show me any pity because of this; its whip continues to lash relentlessly. If my pace slows down even slightly, it will immediately lash me heavily, forcing me to hurry. So I walk silently, without a word, biting my teeth, enduring its insatiable trampling. Thus, my neck gradually bends down, and my chest also shrinks, unable to straighten up again.</p>
<p>"What can life give me?" I asked the terrifying life timidly, with a hysterical tone, almost losing my senses from being tortured. It only tightened its iron-blue face, laughing coldly, and did not pay attention to me. And at the same time, it raised its whip again.</p>
<p>Who says that the top of life is ironed with blue colors and splendid drawings? I do not believe it; these beautiful lines have never floated before my eyes, and I have never harbored this thought. I only know that life only gives me endless tribulations and hardships, making me its cattle and horse for a long time, torturing me every day until my last breath. I also thought about gathering my strength, rushing over and grabbing it to beat it up, resisting its unreasonable oppression, but unfortunately, my legs have become numb from labor, my arms are also cramping, and my strength is even more lacking. So I often grab my hair madly in the sleepless late nights, pound my chest hard, and shout miserably, "You have to let me rest for a while, I am almost unable to move." But life still ignores me, its mouth always hanging with a ferocious sneer, and by tomorrow, it will raise its whip and torment me again.</p>

<p>— Hei Ying</p>
<p>One day, the tall, thin tailor with shoulders like pen rests in the shop fell ill. "You go and rest for a while!" the boss said, standing in front of him like issuing a decree, with his clumsy splayed feet. The patient then breathed a sigh of relief and packed up the scattered cloth scraps, scissors, needle cushions, and other items, dragging his slow, duck-like steps, swaying as he went upstairs. Watching his disappearing back into that room where sunlight never reached, I stood woodenly at the staircase entrance, remembering what he had casually said to me a few days ago.</p>
<p>"Kid! You stand as strong as an ox!" he said, revealing a hint of envy, his eyes fixed on my body. "You won't get sick. But I'm not the same... If you don't get sick, you naturally won't understand the suffering of that punishment; it's really unbearable... Moreover, humans are all callous and snobbish creatures; if you have money and you catch a little cold, someone will ask you if you feel well, if you need medicine. But if you're poor, who cares about you! People will let you hide in your room, not even looking at you, except when you're taken by the King of Hell, then they'll casually prepare a coffin for you... I've seen too much of this kind of world!"</p>
<p>He looked melancholic. Since he got sick a few months ago and the Javanese woman who lived with him abandoned him, his illness had not actually improved. But if he didn't work, he wouldn't have food to eat, so he had to struggle to get up and sit in front of the Singer sewing machine, pedaling the wheel with his weak feet. Now he had fallen again.</p>
<p>Yes, it's best for poor people to be stronger, otherwise no one will pay attention to you if you get sick. That night, after I closed the shop door and turned off all the lights, I tiptoed to his room. I thought he might be asleep; but the candle flame on the rectangular table in front of the bed was still flickering, and I could still hear intermittent groans from inside the yellow mosquito net reaching my eardrums.</p>
<p>"Lao Fang," I called softly.</p>
<p>"Oh, is that you?" He turned over, his listless eyes looking at my face. I sat sideways on the edge of the bed, covering him with the blanket.</p>
<p>"Are you sick... Do you want to buy some medicine? Oh, you haven't eaten yet, do you want..."</p>
<p>"My appetite is not good, no need... Can you check if there's any Ba Gua Dan in that drawer?" he pointed to the table.</p>
<p>I found him a package of Ba Gua Dan, handed it to him, and also brought a glass of boiled water. Outside, it was the quiet, desolate field of May, the wind blowing, the coconut tree leaves rustling. I stood on a stool and closed a window opposite the bed. Accompanying the patient there, I started to doze off. "You go to sleep, I also want to be quiet for a while!" he said to me, closing his eyelids. I put down the mosquito net for him, blew out the candle, and returned to my corner on the third floor.</p>
<p>One day, two days... The tailor's illness did not improve, and the groaning sounds gradually became heavier, making people unable to bear listening to them. I came to see him several times every day, bringing him porridge, buying medicine, opening the window, or sweeping the floor. Sometimes he complained to me, but later he lay weakly on the bed, his eyes staring straight at the top of the mosquito net, and he was too lazy to speak. The landlady always grabbed me to ask about the patient's condition, but she herself stayed far away from him. Her pockmarked face even showed a hateful expression, as if she couldn't wait to shout out loud: "What bad luck, there's a sick ghost living behind my room on the second floor, he's groaning every day, like the King of Hell is dragging him, it's so noisy that people can't sleep... What if he dies in our shop?" However, she didn't have the courage to shout out her concerns. She paced back and forth in the kitchen, muttering, "What to do?" While I was washing rice to prepare to cook, I secretly watched the woman's expression. Finally, she suddenly said to herself, "Why not go to the hospital?"</p>
<p>"Hospital? We don't have a hospital here!" I interjected.</p>
<p>"Send him to the hospital in Yalen," she said.</p>

<p>— Zhou Lengjia</p>
<p>Mr. Xunqing's expression at this time was hard to describe. His face reddened all the way to the roots of his ears, and the reddish patch on his right cheek was now even more translucent. Suddenly, he erupted in a rage and charged straight up to the young woman, saying:</p>
<p>"You fart! You are releasing the loudest, most unbearable skunk farts! Who do you think Jin Xunqing is? Me... Jin Xunqing... a former candidate for county councilor, now a well-known gentleman in the area, would I come to flirt with a worthless piece of trash like you? You dare to slander me publicly, it's outrageous! I bet you were molested by a robber, got your head turned by a ghost, and are now trying to stick to me!"</p>
<p>The young woman was forced back to her seat, continuing her weak and powerless sobs, not daring to speak again. Mr. Xunqing, having gained the upper hand, unleashed his authority even more, filling the entire cabin with his loud, hoarse voice.</p>
<p>"Hmph! You don't even recognize who Jin Xunqing is, and you dare to make trouble on my turf. I can't let you off! Do you know that you have committed a crime? There is a crime in criminal law called public defamation, which is what you have committed now. I won't say much to you, just according to Article... Article... of the criminal law, in short, it's a certain article of the criminal law, I'll sue you immediately! Hey, boatman!"</p>
<p>"What?" the boatman asked listlessly from the stern.</p>
<p>"Get me a long rope."</p>
<p>"Gah! We don't have that."</p>
<p>Liu Cangshui had already fully understood the situation. He felt somewhat indignant for the young woman and couldn't help but step forward and say to Mr. Xunqing:</p>
<p>"Mr. Xunqing, let it go. When it's time to be lenient, be lenient, and when you can forgive, forgive."</p>
<p>"No! Reputation is a person's second life. I don't care if she's a robber's bottom, but I can't tolerate her defaming my reputation!"</p>
<p>Wu Hexuan also seemed to be unable to stand Mr. Xunqing's domineering manner. He shouted at the boatman in a louder voice than Mr. Xunqing.</p>
<p>"Hey! Boatman, where are we?"</p>
<p>"Yangjia Ba is ahead."</p>
<p>"Good! Stop in Yangjia Ba for the night."</p>
<p>His words could almost represent the unanimous opinion of the entire boat, because no one in the cabin expressed any dissent.</p>
<p>A great silence enveloped the entire cabin, in which only the young woman's soft sobbing was faintly audible. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e147">Ministry of Education Inspection: Shandong Province Vocational Education Report <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>An abstract of the Ministry of Education's inspection report on vocational education in Shandong Province is as follows: In the 18th year of the Republic [1929], there were a total of seven provincial vocational education institutions. As a result of mergers and closures in the 19th year [1930], there were three schools. By the 22nd year [1933], the Yanggu Dyeing and Weaving Vocational School was added, bringing the total to four schools. It was originally planned to add the Boshan Ceramics Vocational School in the 23rd year [1934], the Weixian Dyeing and Weaving Vocational School and the Yixian Mining Vocational School in the 24th year [1935], the Yantai Aquatic Products Vocational School and the Jinan Animal Husbandry and Horticulture Vocational School in the 25th year [1936], and the Linqing Agricultural Vocational School and the Jinan Civil Engineering Vocational School in the 26th year [1937], with a planned addition of seven schools in four years. It is stated that the Ceramics Vocational School was not established this year. It has been found that the allocation of secondary education funding in the province deviates greatly from the standards set by the Ministry. Even if the province's original plan is fully implemented, by the 16th year [presumably a typo for the intended 26th year] the vocational education funding would only account for 18%. Now that even this plan has not been implemented on schedule, it is truly regrettable. Recently, the province held a meeting of secondary school principals, and the Education Department proposed a plan to expand vocational education, intending to gradually close down the normal training institutes in various counties and establish joint vocational schools. Subsequently, in the name of the Secondary School Administrative Conference, a proposal was made to the provincial government to implement a "livelihood politics," formulating an industrial construction plan and types of vocational education facilities. This proposal has been included in the province's three-year plan currently under review. Whether it can be realized is unknown. The following are some points that deserve attention based on the inspection:</p>
<p>1.  The province has abundant local products, and the promotion of vocational education should not be delayed. The recently drafted three-year industrial construction plan includes ten schools for the training of technical personnel. The types of departments offered are mostly the same as the province's original vocational education promotion plan. A direction should be determined immediately and implemented quickly, without further delay. Teacher training should also be prepared in advance.</p>
<p>2.  The production quantity of each school is only equal to half of the material cost. For example, with 4,000 yuan of materials, only 2,000 yuan of finished products can be sold, and the rest is all consumption. This urgently needs to be improved.</p>
<p>3.  The funding for vocational schools in the province has not yet been increased according to the prescribed standards, resulting in a severe shortage of school purchase funds. The remaining funds from the annual sales are often used. If vacation work is to be implemented and production is centralized, then large quantities of materials cannot be obtained. A way to increase funding should be found immediately.</p>
<p>4.  The Jinan Junior Industrial Vocational School of Shandong Province has achieved some results, but the output is small and the technology is lacking, resulting in very few sales. Vacation internships should be implemented. Products such as candles made by the applied chemistry department have almost no sales due to the abundance of goods on the market. Attention should be paid to the manufacture of paint, ink, waxed paper, and leather, etc. Leather products are of poor quality and need to be improved urgently. The attached short-term dyeing and weaving class recruits elementary school graduates and older out-of-school people, graduates in one year, and focuses on technology, which is still effective and should continue to be run. It should also be renamed Vocational Training Class.</p>
<p>5.  The Jinan Women's Junior Dyeing, Weaving, and Sericulture Vocational School of Shandong Province has good dyeing and weaving equipment and a large capacity. However, the woven products are mostly thin and not durable, and the output is also small. Concentrated practice should be implemented during the summer vacation of the second grade to achieve proficiency in skills. The sericulture department has simple equipment, no new-style machinery, and the results are mediocre. Recently, the Construction Department of the province is expanding the silkworm breeding experiment station, which requires a large number of people. The teaching content should be enriched and improvements should be sought. The attached third-grade mathematics students are determined to go to higher education and are unwilling to pay attention to practical training, which has a great impact on other students and should be strictly corrected. Those who hope to go to higher education, in addition to normal operations, are allowed to make up for it after class.</p>
<p>6.  The dyeing and weaving achievements of the Jining Junior Industrial Vocational School of Shandong Province are good, but the output is not large enough and more practice should be added. The chemical engineering equipment is simple and urgently needs to be added. The finished products such as leather paint are also too rough. Most students are willing to work hard. The recruitment and training methods of the training class are the same as the above two schools and should be renamed Vocational Training Class and continue to be run.</p>
<p>7.  Licheng County Junior Industrial Vocational School is entirely funded and established by the county, divided into applied chemistry and mechanical engineering departments. The equipment has a foundation and the operation is in accordance with the regulations. There are currently four classes, which are barely sufficient. When the number of classes increases in the future, they must continue to be enriched. The annual recurring expenses can be increased to more than 19,000 yuan when six classes are handled, but the material cost is less than 30 yuan per class per month, which is very difficult, resulting in most of the expenses required for all exercises being paid by teachers who purchase the manufactured products, raising capital and purchasing raw materials, which is not a long-term solution. The department should provide appropriate subsidies year by year to maintain and seek progress. The school's enrollment quota stipulates that Licheng must account for half of the number, and the remaining foreign students are not allowed to replace Licheng students if Licheng County cannot recruit enough. Currently, there are only more than 80 students in total, which is probably due to this and is very uneconomical. The county should be ordered to change its methods, stipulating that students with Licheng County citizenship have priority, but if the quota in this county is insufficient, foreign students are allowed to supplement it in order to enrich the number of students. Also, some students in the school are too young, not strong enough, and feel a little difficult to work. Ways should be found to adjust this.</p>
<p>8.  The private Huilu Vocational School of Industry and Commerce has clean and useful school buildings, and the teaching is relatively earnest. However, the educational facilities in the elementary classes are aimed at entering the senior classes of this school, and general subjects account for almost two-thirds of the entire teaching, which is not appropriate. Commercial training should be increased to make elementary education a stage so that students with economic difficulties have the opportunity to earn a living. Those who wish to enter senior classes can also shorten the course by one year depending on the circumstances, which is different from recruiting junior high school students. The school has not yet been registered and should be done as soon as possible. The name of the school should also be changed. Commercial vocational schools should not be confused with industrial and commercial vocational schools.</p>
<p>9.  The private Huishang Vocational School is extremely lacking in equipment and the operation is illegal. The teaching methods and spirit of each department are improper. The attached commercial normal department, in fact, completely prepares ordinary elementary school teachers, which is even more inappropriate and should be improved within a limited time, otherwise, it will be ordered to stop.</p>
<p>10. The Provincial Public Experimental School has four groups: dyeing and weaving, printing, applied chemistry, and embroidery. Except for dyeing and weaving, the others are too simple. Classes are held in shifts in the morning and afternoon, with two-thirds of the time for public education and one-third for vocational training. It is said that most students can use what they have learned to earn a living. It seems that the equipment should be enriched and reorganized into a vocational training school to match the name.</p>
<p>11. The Department of Education and Industry has established a laboratory instrument and biology specimen manufacturing institute, specializing in the preparation of instruments and specimens for all elementary schools and part of junior high schools, which are sold at low prices to improve primary and secondary education. The intention is very good. It has been found that the number of primary schools in the province has increased sharply in recent years, and the content needs to be improved. The establishment of this manufacturing institute by the department to enrich scientific equipment is an urgent matter. However, the tools are not yet complete and the products are not refined enough. The person in charge should be ordered to go to the scientific instrument and specimen manufacturing institutes in various places to study in detail and strive for improvement. When the operation is successful in the future, the content can be expanded and attention can be paid to the manufacture of standard tools for labor science in primary and secondary schools to improve labor education.</p>
<p>12. The Agricultural College of Shandong University has been engaged in the study of fertilizer application, plowing and planting of cotton seeds, and pests and diseases of taro seedlings in recent years, and has achieved considerable results. In order to promote the research results, training courses have been held in Laiyang, Licheng, and other regions, recruiting young farmers to provide them with useful agricultural remedial education, which has also been effective. However, due to economic difficulties, it is impossible to expand the facilities and appropriate subsidies can be given as needed to promote it. Recently, the university has cooperated with three provincial rural teachers' schools to enrich the content of agricultural subjects. The method is very good and should be stepped up.</p>

<p>(Nanchang, 8th) Cheng Shi-kuei attended the Special Education Conference and returned to the province. According to him, the province has been approved to allocate 150,000 yuan for special education, which is more than any other province. However, the province's budget requires 240,000 yuan, which is insufficient. The province will find ways to raise the funds.</p>

The reason for this was the increase in the number of classes. The annual merit-based pay increases spent in the first and second halves of the 23rd year [1934] were all over 10,000 yuan. Almost all of the more than 80 municipal elementary schools have teachers who received this preferential treatment.</p>

<p>Since Chairman Chiang proposed the slogan of national economic construction, it has immediately aroused enthusiastic discussions in all circles in the country. However, national economic construction is a major undertaking, and it must be done with the concerted efforts of the people. It is only possible to be successful if we encourage ourselves to go. The most important thing is that before taking action, we should prepare a proper plan so that we can achieve twice the result with half the effort. For example, China's industry in the past was backward. If it is impossible to establish industry, can we find a way out from the rural areas? What is the current financial problem in China and how to solve it? All such issues must be understood before engaging in national economic construction. The ninth issue of Cultural Construction provides ample space for research on the above issues. Those who care about economics must read it, and those who care about national economic construction must read it even more. It is heard that the journal's preferential half-price policy for members of the Readers' Progress Association has been extended to the end of the month. Members of the Readers' Progress Association should not miss this opportunity.</p>

<p>Since the New People Weekly, published by the New People Weekly Society at 6 Longde Village, Labu Road, French Concession, Shanghai, has been published, the number of subscribers has increased daily, with sales exceeding 10,000.

<h3 id="e159">Municipal Track and Field Meet: The Second Joint Games Yesterday <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Adding Five New Events Such as High Hurdles and Intermediate Hurdles</p>
<p>——Breaking Records in Four Events Including 400m and 1500m</p>
<p>The second joint sports meet organized by the Shanghai Municipal Track and Field Promotion Association was postponed due to heavy rain. It was finally held yesterday at 2 PM at the Shen Garden Sports Field. Although it was already hot summer weather, the afternoon was cloudy and rainless. Though the sun occasionally shone directly, it soon hid in the clouds, giving the athletes excellent opportunities. However, the spectators were few, perhaps deterred by the summer heat. The games officially started at 2:37 PM, and many new records were set. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Track Event Sketches</p>
<p>(Short Distance) Huang Feilong lived up to his reputation as an expert in the 100-meter race. After 50 meters, Huang took the lead, swiftly breaking the white line, finishing more than a foot ahead. Pole vault champion Fu Baolu also competed in this event yesterday, representing the Baihong team, showing that Baihong's short-distance talents are all from outside Shanghai. It seems that "Shu has no great generals, so Liao Hua serves as the vanguard." In Group B, Chen Junruo led Xun Lun, proving himself an outstanding figure. His face was familiar, and upon inquiry, it turned out to be Chen Yongfu under an alias. Huang Feilong was highly anticipated in the 200-meter race, and he indeed lived up to expectations. Ping Fuchang of Group B had previously shown his skills in the Mass Amateur Games and also took the lead yesterday. The strong athlete Ye Songping brought his spiked shoes and strolled on the green lawn yesterday, but ultimately did not compete. Otherwise, he would have offered even better results.</p>
<p>(Middle Distance) Middle-distance expert Jia Lianren did not compete yesterday due to foot pain. Sun Huipei, nicknamed "Big Cat," competed in the 400-meter race and naturally had no rivals, setting a new meet record. In Group B, Qu Binghui's strength was comparable to that of the veteran Jia, and he even surpassed Big Cat by one second at the finish line, which was quite remarkable. The 800-meter race was held jointly for Groups A and B. As a result, Le Junchang and Gu Binghou of Group B finished ahead of Fu Yuanxiang of Group A, with times two and two-tenths seconds faster.</p>
<p>(Long Distance) The 1500-meter race was also held jointly for Groups A and B. Yang Qingxie showed great form yesterday, surpassing Wang Tianlin, who had been the center of attention, by three meters. It is well known that Wang Zhenglin failed to defeat the British athlete Brown in the 5,000 and 10,000-meter races, which was due to this reason, and not a fault of strategy. Zhou Zhicheng of Group B had previously shown his skills in the city-wide and Suzhou public sports fields. He also ran very well yesterday. The 10,000-meter race was temporarily changed to 5,000 meters yesterday, and Wang Zhenglin naturally had no rivals. However, due to the hot weather, the results were not particularly outstanding. Ling Xuewen of Group B had beautiful form and ample strength, making him a promising athlete.</p>
<p>(Hurdle Races) Chen Jiayou's leg injury had just healed. In the second hurdle, he soared like a swallow skimming the water, his feet light and agile. It was as if a swallow was flying across the grass. It seems that after three days apart, he must be viewed with new respect. Wang Jinsheng's performance in Group B was also quite good. In the intermediate hurdles, Big Cat led the pack, but he was too eager, knocking down two hurdles along the way. He still finished eight meters ahead. In Group B, only Xi Zhuyi started, with Sun Zhizhong accompanying him in a demonstration lap.</p>
<p>Field Event Details</p>
<p>(Triple Throw) Fu Baolu first participated in the discus throw yesterday, and Li Zipu was unexpectedly defeated. Cheng Mengping and Gu Zhao of Group B achieved better results than the third place finisher in Group A. Bao Jialiang had no problem with the shot put, while Yang Dili led Group B. Wang Xuewu's performance in the javelin in Group B exceeded Li Zipu's in Group A by a full meter. Tang Xianzhuo did not stand out yesterday. Detailed records of each group are listed below:</p>
<p>Group A Javelin</p>
<p>(1) Li Zipu: 47.14 meters</p>
<p>(2) Tang Xianzhuo: 46.44 meters</p>
<p>(3) Wei Zhiping: 43.71 meters</p>
<p>Group B Javelin</p>
<p>(1) Wang Xuewu: 48.05 meters</p>

<p>(Triple Jump) Wang He's jump was only 6.40 meters at the start of the running long jump, but he reached 6.56 meters on his third try. Huo Jukang of Group B took the lead with one jump, and no one could compete with him. In the high jump, Xu Wenkui of Group A had a very good performance, and Huang Jiaxu of Group B was also quite good. The triple jump was originally Wang He's specialty. Apart from Zhang Jiakui, he was the best. Jiang Huairen struggled with nearsightedness and was not Wang's match. Huang Jiaxu of Group B had an average performance. Detailed results of each group are listed below:</p>

<p>(Pole Vault) Pole vault champion Fu Baolu, after participating in the 100-meter and discus throws yesterday, was at a loss and lost to Wang and Wei. Later, to restore his reputation, he jumped over 3.43 meters, but it was only for demonstration purposes. Wang He has been making rapid progress lately, but yesterday's performance in the triple jump was somewhat diminished. The three athletes in Group B achieved similar results, but Zhou Song jumped first and took first place.</p>

<p>The second Huxi Basketball Competition has concluded its semi-finals yesterday. Weiming defeated Shengde with a score of 46 to 39 and won the right to compete in the finals against Fufeng. Both teams have achieved a record of seven wins and eight matches forming a confrontational situation. After a decision by the committee, the final game will be held tomorrow (Tuesday) at 5:30 PM to determine the championship. The referees will be Zhang Wenyuan and Shi Zhaokang, and Zhou Jiaqi will be invited to present the awards after the match. The competition of yesterday is summarized as follows. Weiming attacked immediately upon taking the court, gaining tremendous momentum. Shengde was careful and did not succeed. Weiming was eager to win, and Tian Fang and Jin Yan were penalized and removed from the court one after the other. However, Weiming was still ahead with a score of 19 to 14 in the first half. In the second half, Shengde worked hard to counterattack and had a good chance to overtake, being just one point behind Weiming at the closest point. Unfortunately, they lacked a little luck and were unable to catch up step by step. Weiming relied entirely on quick shots, almost hitting every shot, so they were able to defeat Shengde with a score of 46 to 39 and win the right to compete in the finals against Fufeng tomorrow. In another match, Huang Automobile defeated the Car team with a score of 76 to 6. The battle record of Weiming and Shengde is listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e166">Discussion on the Opinion of Issuing Commodity Securities <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Yutong</p>
<p>The stability of a country's economy depends on a sound monetary policy. In recent years, China's economic situation has been chaotic, almost entirely affected by unsound monetary policies. Silver, in China, is the sole standard currency, while in other countries, it is regarded merely as a commodity. Therefore, during the past years of the gold expensive and silver cheap trend, our economic circles were severely influenced by other factors, further inflicting deep pain on the silver standard. The United States's aim in raising the price of silver was to universally increase the world's silver price, so that gold prices would fall and commodity prices would gradually and progressively increase. Its sole purpose was to increase the purchasing power of silver standard countries to improve its own foreign trade. However, the result may not have matched its expectations. The price of silver has indeed seen a universal increase worldwide, but the increase in the purchasing power of silver standard countries, from the perspective of gold standard countries, can be theoretically affirmed, but in practice, it has been the opposite. For example, today, China is experiencing a rise in the value of currency due to the increase in the price of silver, directly leading to a drop in commodity prices, economic recession, and declining purchasing power. All of these are practical evidences. Especially recently, China's silver reserves have been lured by the US silver purchase policy, resulting in a large outflow. It is a natural result that monetary tightening has become more profound. The implementation of this type of silver purchase policy is only harmful to China's monetary system, harming others without benefiting oneself. I do not know why the US government adopted the policy of raising the price of silver. Therefore, commentators generally believe that China's adoption of the silver standard currency is no longer in line with the times. However, the gold exchange standard promoted by Mr. Kemmerer is also difficult to realize. Various paper currency standards also have no hope of being implemented in China. As a result, China's monetary system still cannot but base its foundation on metals. Among advanced countries, some can maintain the gold standard with only a 30% gold reserve. If China has sound banks, unifies paper currency, and maintains credit in the future, then the silver standard system can still continue. However, based on the current situation, the implementation of the silver purchase policy remains unchanged, and it has not been slightly altered, but has become even more intensified. On the one hand, China wants to reorganize its currency system to maintain the silver standard, but this cannot be achieved overnight. Therefore, in recent years, there has been a prevailing argument among people in China's economic circles advocating for a currency revolution. Mr. Xu Qingfu, in his books "An Economic Revolution to Save the Country," strongly advocated for thorough progress, with thorough ideals and meticulous organization, showing unique insights. Later, Mr. Yan Baichuan gave a speech on issuing commodity securities and has piloted rural credit cooperative bonds in Xinxian and Wutai in Shanxi Province. Recently, I was fortunate to receive an article written by Mr. Xu Qingfu, "Opinions on Issuing Commodity Securities." Mr. Xu deeply feels that China's production is backward, international trade is in a deficit position, and silver, as the raw material of China's currency, is always sought from abroad, increasing the amount of imports. Therefore, he advocates issuing commodity securities, which can also make the currency abundant and link currency with commodity prices, so that commodity prices do not increase due to the increase in the amount of currency. This will increase production, increase the effect of actual distribution, increase the amount of consumption, and achieve the purpose of economic improvement. Mr. Qingfu is an economist in China, and an outstanding figure in our party. I recently received his great work, and after repeated discussions, I deeply admire him. However, there are still a few points that I would like to discuss with Mr. Qingfu.</p>
<p>The issuance of commodity securities must be preceded by a large-scale national survey and statistics of commodities. For the country's commodities, their production situation, supply and demand relationship, and value must be precisely measured and statistically analyzed. In addition, the transportation and transaction procedures for various commodities are different, and there are also seasonal and regional differences, with quality changes depending on the climate and season. All of these should be considered thoroughly. Secondly, the implementation of the commodity securities system will bring about significant changes to the economic lives of the middle and upper classes. They are accustomed to consuming refined commodities, mainly imported goods. Now, the commodities represented by commodity securities are all domestically produced goods. The implementation of the commodity securities system for the general public is to prevent the superior economic life of the middle and upper classes, reduce their material enjoyment, and force them to conform to the general economic life. Under today's complex economic situation in China, it is uncertain whether this can be promoted smoothly. Mr. Xu also said, "For the foreign goods we need, apart from those with limited underground reserves and special products due to the relationship between weather and geography, most can be imitated... If the commodity securities system is implemented, they can safely produce them, and products that do not exist now can also be produced, so there is no need to rely on foreigners." This is indeed what we want to achieve. However, in reality, China's material progress today is not as good as others, and its science and technology are also backward. Ordinary foreign goods can barely be imitated, but those that are refined and have specialized characteristics have all sorts of problems in terms of technology and raw materials. If we still use the old methods of purchasing raw materials from abroad, or partially manufactured products, and hiring foreign technicians to specialize in imitation, then the payment for raw materials and the salaries of foreign technicians will have a close relationship with the currency system. Moreover, under the current precarious state of China's entire national economy, it cannot tolerate the existence of such imitation industries. Furthermore, the importance of the gradual development of material enjoyment should also be considered. In other words, the era is continuously advancing, and human material desires are also progressing day by day. If it is small, it is enough to help the intelligence and skills of human beings to become more refined; if it is large, it can make the cause flourish. Since the number of people can survive with the transformation of the era, they must also conform to the material enjoyment of the era to match it. Material civilization is indeed sufficient to constitute the elements of national survival. Therefore, at the beginning of the implementation of the commodity securities system, it is not advisable to excessively suppress the general material desires, otherwise, it will be like cutting the feet to fit the shoes, and the benefits will not be commensurate with the harm that follows. My intention in making these remarks is not to speak up for the middle and upper classes who enjoy a superior life, but I also feel that the implementation of economic policies should strive to avoid actions that are contrary to economic principles.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu said, "When implementing the commodity securities system, we must control all production sectors." This is indeed the key point. The scope of industrial control is extremely large. I will only briefly mention a few points that must be known about commodity production and sales control:</p>
<p>1. Control of Commodity Production: (A) Quality Control, (B) Seed Quality Control, (C) Specification Control,</p>
<p>2. Control of Prices and Sales: (A) Price Control, (B) Sales Price Ratio Control,</p>
<p>3. Control of Production Volume and Supply and Demand: (A) Production Volume Control, (B) Transportation Volume Control,</p>
<p>4. Control of Raw Material Procurement,</p>
<p>Therefore, in industrial control legislation, if it is crude and unrefined, the effect of control will not be seen, and it will have a great impact on the entire commodity securities system. This must be paid attention to. The above is only a brief expression of my humble opinion. In the future, if there is a chance, I would like to have a detailed discussion with Mr. Qingfu to seek his advice. -- May 22, 1935, in Beiping</p>
<h3 id="e167">Improvements in Rural Ding County, Hebei <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Shaoliu</p>
<p>Ding County is a special experimental county designated by the Hebei Provincial County Administration Construction Research Institute. All undertakings within the county—particularly in the realm of rural economics—are being vigorously implemented after careful research by various experts. Many projects are now demonstrably underway and progressing forward, thereby stirring the interest of observers from both China and abroad. In recent years, the number of visitors has been no fewer than several hundred. The following is a brief description of the recent general situation in rural Ding County for the reference of those concerned about and studying rural issues:</p>
<p>The total land area is 3,650 square miles. According to a 1934 survey by the Rural Reconstruction Movement (Pingmin Jiaoyu Chujinhui), 1.6 million mu of farmland have already been cultivated. Distributing this land among the county's large population of 400,000 people results in an average of only four mu per person. This is a startling difference when compared to the fact that English farmers need 15 mu of land per person to maintain a living, and American farmers need 16.09 mu per person to break even. Therefore, the underlying difficulty in the past lives of Ding County farmers was the triad of “large population, limited land, and insufficient grain distribution.” However, they have managed to survive peacefully until now, though it is easy to imagine how low their standard of living must be. Recently, well-digging has become exceptionally developed in the county (according to the results of an inspection by Zhang Houwan from the Civil Affairs Department this year, the whole county has more than 60,000 surplus laborers; see the May 27th issue of *Ta Kung Pao*), which has greatly increased farmers' productivity. As a result, a substantial amount of agricultural produce is exported annually via the Pinghan Railway.</p>
<p>The county lacks high mountains and large rivers. The plains are vast and seemingly endless. The fertile soil is quite suitable for cultivation. Due to the similar environmental conditions in each village, all farmland relies on well irrigation. (According to the 1934 survey by the Rural Reconstruction Movement, there were 50,000 wells; according to a recent inspection by Zhang Cunwan, Director of the Hebei Civil Affairs Department, the whole county has 60,000 wells; see the May 27th issue of *Ta Kung Pao*.) Even in years without rain, farmers can still plant and sow as usual. Therefore, there is a saying: "Ding County never dies from drought, while Qu Yang never fills from floods." There are two types of wells: pulley wells and waterwheel wells. Because waterwheel wells are more difficult to dig, they are less common, accounting for about a quarter of the total. Waterwheels mostly use livestock power to draw water. Pulley wells rely entirely on human power to turn the crank. Waterwheel wells have twice the water output of pulley wells. On average, each pulley well can irrigate two mu, while a waterwheel can irrigate seven or eight mu. In dry weather, each well can irrigate about one mu in rotation. Recently, the North China Water Conservancy Commission and the China, Hebei, and Jinpo Banks have separately offered well-digging loans at 8% interest, repayable in three years. It is reported that many farmers have already taken out loans to dig wells. In the future, the increase in the number of wells will certainly lead to a large increase in agricultural production. As such, the problem of "large population, limited land" for Ding County farmers should be resolved, barring unforeseen natural disasters or man-made calamities. The automatic water pump invented by the Livelihood Education Department of the Rural Reconstruction Movement has also been successfully tested. It is estimated that each machine can irrigate four mu of land per day. It consists of an endless chain with long handles placed on top. Once the chain is cranked, it rotates continuously, and water is sprayed upwards from the chain's empty spaces. The machine parts are so easy to operate that children of fourteen or fifteen years old can crank it. It is more labor-saving than ordinary waterwheels or pulley wells, and the amount of water drawn is also greater than that of waterwheels. Currently, four machines have been transported separately to Buluogang and Jianyang county villages to help farmers irrigate their fields. If they can be promoted on a large scale in the future, it will certainly be good news for the farmers of Ding County!</p>
<p>The county is divided into five districts, with a total of 472 villages of various sizes. The farmers' lifestyles are generally the same. Except for the Gaojiazhuang area in the fourth district, which resembles Qu Yi, the rest all follow a very simple way of life, wearing cloth clothes and eating vegetables, living in harmonious joy. Under the old rule of "working at sunrise and resting at sunset," they do not consider it a hardship to sweat and toil. The amount of the year's harvest determines their regular expenses throughout the year. If it is still insufficient, they must find a way to engage in side occupations or seek other work as compensation. Their daily food is mainly millet, supplemented by vegetables. Non-wealthy families rarely eat wheat flour. They usually eat three meals a day, but only two meals during the winter slack season. Most of the surplus grain is stored for consumption during the busy farming season in the coming year. Furthermore, eight or nine out of ten people only boil a few pieces of sweet potatoes and yams for their two meals, drinking plain water with their food. Their standard of living is truly pitiful. However, their habit of frugality is a unique virtue of the farmers of Ding County. Their clothing is even simpler, mostly purple-flowered homespun cloth woven by their own women. Each set of clothes is not easily replaced until it is worn to tatters and can no longer be mended. Although women in the city have recently been influenced by new trends and mostly pursue fashionable clothing and purchase foreign goods, according to a recent survey, the total value of women's ornaments imported annually exceeds 180,000 yuan. It is difficult to find even one woman with bound feet (under the age of twenty) walking through the streets and alleys. Most of the residential houses have flat roofs, built entirely of bricks, stones, and adobe. The walls are exceptionally sturdy. Each room must have an earthen pit. Ordinary five-member families mostly have four or five rooms, which are not crowded. However, there are very few windows, making it difficult for air to circulate, and the light is mostly dark, which is not in line with hygiene. Farmers are most compelled by life in spring, autumn, and during the wheat harvest, and they are extremely willing to work hard no matter how busy they are. Occasionally, in addition to harvesting their own crops, they also take the time to pick up the ears of grain left behind in other people's fields. Usually, eight or nine out of ten women go to the fields to help with the work, which is admirable compared to other counties where women are ashamed to go to the fields. Therefore, most women in the fields can crank the pulley to irrigate the fields and use hoes and shovels to till the land. The people's nature is straightforward and honest, which is well-known throughout North China, hence their tendency to litigate. They often engage in years of litigation over extremely trivial matters, causing them to become impoverished and bankrupt. It is said that there is hardly a village in the county without lawsuits (litigation), and some villages have more than one or two cases. The former county magistrate, Huo Liuding, once issued a notice advising farmers to stop suing. The text included the line, "A certain person from Ding County is quick-tempered and starts sixteen lawsuits a day..." which serves as clear evidence. It is said that the total annual cost of litigation exceeds 800,000 yuan (including appeals). This staggering cost of lawsuits is truly a major cause of rural economic bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Affected by economic bankruptcy, the value of land in the county has plummeted in recent years. Land that was worth 100 yuan per mu four or five years ago is now reduced to 20 or 30 yuan, and no one even asks about it, making it impossible for farmers to sell. As a result, responsible families declare bankruptcy, with as many as eight families doing so in a single year in the small village of Baihu, west of the city. To cope with this difficulty, the former county magistrate, Huo Liuding, ordered farmers in various villages to organize debt mediation committees to clean up their debts on their own, but this was not very effective. Fortunately, this spring, China, Jincheng, and Hebei Banks implemented loans totaling 800,000 yuan. The countryside has slightly revived economically due to this large amount of funds. Recently, the county government has also been urgently seeking to promote the organization of cooperative societies, which farmers join voluntarily. All matters related to farmers' livelihoods are centered on the cooperative societies, including cooperative loans, cooperative purchasing, and cooperative marketing. If this yields results in the future, the benefits to farmers will certainly be substantial. The rural produce, wheat, millet, rice, and beans, are all produced in large quantities, followed by corn and sorghum. According to the Rural Reconstruction Movement's 1934 general survey, the total annual production of millet was 6.11 million dan, and the total annual production of wheat was 4.34 million dan. In addition to being consumed by farmers in large quantities, the export value reached 300,000 yuan. Recently, the production of cotton and peanuts has increased sharply. Last year, the production of cotton reached 7.8 million dan, more than double the previous year. The production of peanuts reached 80 million kilograms, an increase of two-thirds over the previous year. Most of it is purchased by large merchants from Beijing and Tianjin and transported to various domestic and foreign locations for sale. In addition, Chinese cabbage and Ya pears are also special products, with a total annual production value of no less than 1 million yuan. Recently, the "drought-resistant millet" trial planted by the Livelihood Department of the Rural Reconstruction Movement has been successfully tested. This millet has a natural drought resistance ability and saves half the water compared to other millets. It has now been continuously trial planted by village cooperative societies. If it can be promoted in the future, farmers' food supply can be greatly increased, which would also be a great blessing for the people's food supply. The most common rural side occupations currently are handicrafts, pig farming, and salt leaching. Handicrafts are most developed in weaving cloth and making vermicelli, which do not stop even during the busiest farming season. It is estimated that the total annual output of cloth is 3 million yuan (according to the Rural Reconstruction Movement's survey). The materials are all cotton grown by the farmers themselves. The production methods are all manual. Each bolt of cloth can make a profit of one jiao in addition to the cost of labor and materials. In addition to being worn by farmers, most of it is sold by cloth merchants from the Zhangjiakou area and transported by camel to the northwest for sale, with a total annual export value of 200,000 yuan. The total annual production of vermicelli reaches 5 million kilograms. In addition to being consumed in this county, most of it is transported by carts to Shenze and Anguo counties and resold in the Daqing River, Ziya River, and Grape River basins. However, most of it is sweet potato vermicelli. The production method involves mashing sweet potatoes, crushing them with a stone mill, and placing them in a wooden sieve to extract the powder, which is made into a paste and dripped into a pot of boiling water and taken out to form vermicelli. This is most common in the villages in the southwest area, accounting for almost four-fifths of the villages, and is the farmers' only side occupation. Unfortunately, most of it is done manually, adhering to old methods without knowing how to improve them. Production is a major part of the county government's six major constructions. Those in charge should urgently find ways to improve it and use machinery to increase production. This is not only related to farmers' livelihoods but also greatly benefits the hygiene of vermicelli food, which is essential for our daily lives. Because farmers operate vermicelli workshops, almost eight or nine out of ten raise pigs. Usually, walking casually into any village, you can easily see groups of three or five pigs (except in Muslim villages). This is because raising pigs can not only get a high price but also provide much-needed fertilizer for farmland by feeding them the residue left over from vermicelli production, watering them with vermicelli soup. The pigs grow very quickly. When the pigs are fattened, each pig can usually be sold for ten yuan. In addition to being consumed in the county, most of it is purchased by local merchants and transported to Beijing and Tianjin for sale, commonly called "walking Beijing pigs." Each pig can earn five jiao, with an annual export value of approximately 150,000 yuan. Recently, the Rural Reconstruction Movement Farm's "Boar Hybrid Pigs" have been successfully tested and are vigorously promoted. Farmers in various villages are vying to buy them, but because they are very large and develop quickly, they must have a large amount of feed to be raised well.</p>
<p>The excess population and difficulty in making a living in this county is a very serious reality. As a result, most ambitious men (they do not necessarily have farmland) go out to seek their fortunes one after another. Most of them go to the three northeastern provinces, hence the slogan "going down to Guandong." Some engage in business, while others reclaim land and work. They all gather and return after autumn. In total, there are always fifty to sixty thousand people each year. Their hard-earned wages are usually around eighty yuan. After the September 18th Incident, the national crisis was serious, and farmers could not go out, which invisibly increased the number of unemployed farmers who needed to be fed in Ding County, which was also a major cause of rural collapse. According to a survey by the Rural Reconstruction Movement, the number of people privately appointed by traitors in the spring of 1934 was no less than 20,000, but most of them were deceived by foremen, and many families are still suing.</p>
<p>Because the farmers in this county are forced by life to have no money to buy edible salt, and because a small number of lands have a salty taste due to geological reasons, many villagers sweep the soil and leach salt, making it their only way to make a living. For example, along the north bank of the Shahe River in the first district, the northeast of the second district, the south of the third district, the northwest of the fourth district, and the west of the fifth district, approximately sixty villages all have privately set up salt pans to leach salt. On average, one hundred catties of soil can be leached into two dan of salt water, which can be dried into twenty catties of salt and eight catties of saltpeter. According to the price, salt is worth one yuan, while saltpeter is more than ten times higher, worth three or four yuan. Therefore, leaching one hundred catties of soil can earn a total of five yuan, which is far more profitable than planting crops by ten times. Therefore, the farmers in these villages are willing to sacrifice planting to maintain their livelihoods, and they must leach salt privately, even after being repeatedly punished by the stationed Ding County Anti-Smuggling Brigade.</p>
<p>In addition, the prevalence of drugs and the heavy exploitation of exorbitant taxes are also major causes of the rural depression. According to those familiar with the situation in the county, almost every village has people who smoke and sell opium, especially in the city. It is estimated that the annual consumption is around one million yuan (the number surveyed by Huo Liuding when he took over the county the year before last). Such a shocking amount is truly a major cause of rural bankruptcy. The land tax in Ding County, in addition to the regular amount, has additional surcharges and taxes that exceed double the amount. On average, each person bears more than one yuan. At this time of people's lack of livelihood and rural bankruptcy, abolishing exorbitant taxes is a proper priority. The Hebei Donation Tax Management Council has recently sent a letter requesting that the first phase of Ding County's exorbitant taxes, totaling 9,610 yuan, be abolished. Although the amount is not much, if it can be implemented, it can slightly alleviate the people's difficulties.</p>
<p>The above is a disorganized and casual writing about the current situation, past conditions, and causes of collapse in rural Ding County, which is truly laughable. However, Ding County is an experimental county, and its general situation can represent the North China region, so everything is worth our study. Therefore, I have drafted this article, despite its simplicity, in order to elicit further insights.</p>
<h3 id="e168">The Trend of Currency Issues (Continued and Concluded) <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>

<p>—Also Discussing the Future of the Franc—</p>
<p>2. Exchange Restriction—Methods of restricting or suppressing the freedom of foreign exchange transactions are divided into five types: A. Restriction of capital movement—In a free capital market, the movement of international capital is unhindered; however, under a managed currency system, there are various methods to restrain the movement of capital: (1) Restricting the purchase of foreign exchange, (2) Restricting the purchase of foreign securities, (3) Restricting the export of raw gold and silver, and domestic and foreign banknotes. B. Restricting speculation, in three aspects: (1) Restricting domestic residents from purchasing foreign exchange, (2) Restricting domestic residents from trading spot and forward foreign exchange for foreigners, (3) Restricting domestic residents from lending national currency credit to foreigners. C. Restricting domestic residents from holding foreign currency, in two ways: (1) Forcing domestic residents to hand over foreign currency obtained from exports, (2) Forcing domestic residents to hand over bank deposits and securities held abroad. D. Restricting the repayment of foreign debts, also in three ways: (1) Suspending the transfer of foreign credit, (2) Retaining foreign credit within the country, (3) Restricting importers from purchasing foreign currency.</p>
<p>3. Gold Policy—The normal gold policy of various countries is to purchase gold in order to stabilize the currency value by enriching their reserves. Examples include Japan's Gold Holding Act, gold purchase policy, and the United States' purchase and subsidization of raw gold and silver production. In extraordinary times, the following methods are used: A. Taxing to equalize cash transportation points, B. Changing the official purchase price, C. Lowering the gold parity.</p>
<p>4. Exchange Clearing System—This system allows international credits and debts to be settled without foreign exchange procedures. The method is that the central banks of the countries concerned usually keep accounts in their respective national currencies, mutually clearing all international lending and borrowing arising from international trade. In other words, export proceeds must be offset against import proceeds from another country, eliminating the need for foreign exchange receipts and payments. This method can be implemented bilaterally between two countries or multilaterally between three countries.</p>
<p>5. Exchange Equalization Funds—A fund is established by a country's financial authorities specifically for the purpose of equalizing foreign exchange, as practiced in the United Kingdom and the United States. This method involves the central bank purchasing foreign exchange during export booms and selling foreign exchange during import booms, as a means of adjustment.</p>
<p>(4) The Scars of Sacrifice</p>
<p>At a time when countries are unanimously abandoning the gold standard, implementing a managed currency system, and using currency warfare to invade markets and stimulate production, only the gold bloc centered on France still maintains its "glorious isolation," guarding the bulwark of the gold standard.</p>
<p>However, this conservatism is exchanged for a huge sacrifice. By the time it obtains "glory," it is already scarred, and the general public has suffered greatly.</p>
<p>If we examine the scars of these "glorious isolationists," we can refer to the following figures.</p>
<p>Wholesale Price Index of Gold Bloc Countries (1913=100)</p>
<p>1919 1920 1921 1922 1923 1924</p>
<p>France 217.3 222.5 101.9 86.8 80.9 76.4</p>
<p>Belgium 212.9 108.4 90.2 77.2 72.3 68.0</p>
<p>Italy 481.0 411.0 342.0 110.0 282.0 276.0</p>
<p>Netherlands 142.0 227.0 97.0 79.0 74.0 78.0</p>
<p>Industrial Production Index of Gold Bloc Countries (1928=100)</p>
<p>1929 1930 1931 1932 1933 1934</p>
<p>France 109.4 110.2 97.6 77.6 84.3 78.4</p>
<p>Belgium 101.1 89.8 82.8 69.9 71.7 61.3</p>
<p>Italy 109.2 100.3 84.7 73.0 80.5 87.1</p>
<p>Netherlands 102.5 93.7 81.0 63.9 70.9 70.9</p>
<p>Note: According to the League of Nations Monthly Bulletin of Statistics</p>
<p>Just by looking at the wholesale price index and industrial production index of the gold bloc countries, we can understand the downward trend after the panic began. The situation in the past two years is in stark contrast to countries that have abandoned the gold standard. For example, the wholesale price index in the United States increased from 94.5 the year before last to 107.2 last year, and the United Kingdom also increased from 100.9 to 104.0. In terms of international trade, bankruptcies, and unemployment, countries that abandoned the gold standard all showed improvement or improvement, while countries that did not abandon the gold standard were "getting worse and worse." No wonder Professor Cassel (A.Caosel) said that the inability to restore the world economy is due to the gold bloc countries' reluctance to maintain the gold standard.</p>
<p>(5) The Future Trend—What is the future of the Franc?</p>
<p>Since Belgium abandoned the gold standard in March of this year, the Netherlands is also precarious: people's attention is focused on the franc, thinking that since the gold bloc has been differentiated, the future of the French gold standard is also in imminent danger.</p>
<p>Judging from the general economic situation in France, from the difficulties in French finances, or from the large outflow of gold from French reserves, anyone has reason to prove that the future of the franc is not so secure. According to the *Shen Pao* on May 27, the Banque de France lost as much as 30 million pounds of gold to the United States alone since May 8. At the same time, "the deficit in the French budget is 135 million pounds, and the financial panic it has encountered is unprecedented since Poincaré took office." - *Shen Pao*, May 18.</p>
<p>However, will this only surviving authoritative currency really collapse from this? I am afraid no one dares to answer. We know that the stability of the franc has its own special foundation. If we want to explore its safety, in addition to the surface phenomena, we must also understand this special foundation.</p>
<p>First, observe from the perspective of French traditional policy. Since the war, the French people have suffered greatly from the expansion of the franc. Since the franc savior Poincaré reorganized it in 1928, it has gradually stabilized; and they are especially afraid of the old pain. Therefore, the French government and people unanimously safeguard the safety of the franc and oppose its abandonment of the gold standard or devaluation. Successive cabinets have clearly expressed their determination to maintain the franc. Whenever a financial bill is passed by the parliament, the parliament and the government work together to reduce the budget in order to maintain the balance of payments and avoid the expansion of the franc. According to reports, French finances are experiencing great difficulties this time, but the government's expression to the outside world is still determined to maintain the safety of the franc (*Shen Pao*, May 28).</p>
<p>Secondly, observe from the perspective of the French economic structure. France is different from other countries. For example, the goal of the United Kingdom and the United States in abandoning the gold standard is to increase prices, stimulate production, and increase exports on the one hand; and to reduce the debt burden of domestic debtors by devaluing the currency on the other. Private debt in the United States reaches 70,000,000,000 US dollars, and this debt is mostly dispersed among countless small debtors, while the creditors are concentrated in a few financial institutions. France has very little private debt, and the people mostly invest in government bonds, so its debt is the government's debt to the people. Therefore, the devaluation of the currency by the United States to reduce debt is welcomed by the general public; in France, it is opposed by the general public.</p>
<p>Finally, in terms of the abundance of French gold reserves, France does not need to abandon the gold standard. Until the end of last year, France's gold reserves never fell below 800 million francs, and the ratio to the amount of banknotes in circulation also never fell below 70%. (According to the International League of Nations Statistical Monthly Report) We know that there are two ways for cash to flow out: one is to exchange banknotes for cash or take cash with checks, and the other is for France to export cash itself to repay international debts. Judging from the current situation, the latter is impossible, and the former means that the cash decreases, that is, the debt also decreases accordingly, without any loss to the storage reserves. According to recent telegrams, "officials are convinced that the government will not suppress the value of the franc, because the gold reserves still have 110 million pounds, which is enough to meet any emergency" (*Shen Pao*, May 28), which is proof of this.</p>
<p>Having said that, my point is not that the position of the franc is still absolutely safe now. Because we know that all traditional policies are not immutable, and even the most solid forces do not have the power to change the world to compensate for the huge gap in finance. And the so-called protection of the interests of the majority of farmers and wealthy securities holders will ultimately not be able to resist the decline of the entire industrial economy and the suffering of large numbers of unemployed workers. In addition to this, there are also accusations from other countries; then, even if France can still wear the tattered clothing of the gold standard, what is the point?</p>
<p>The Banque de France has always been called a bottomless gold vault, and the strong holding of gold is naturally a point it can be proud of. However, according to foreign telegrams, the cash lost from March 29 of last year to the present has reached 2,372,000,000 francs (*Shen Pao*, May 27). In recent days, speculators have been even more active, and by the end of this month, it may be more than that. The Banque de France's discount rate has increased from two and a half to four percent, and it is said that there is still a possibility of increasing, and the helplessness is also visible in general.</p>
<p>My conclusion is that the gold standard of the franc may be maintained temporarily, but if the general economic situation does not improve, then abandonment is only a matter of time. The future of world currency may only be seen in banknotes before long; at that time, the world's economists should be asked to talk about the world's standard system again. -May 28, 1935-</p>

<h3 id="e169">Finance   The Foreign Exchange Market Remains Dull and Stagnant <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Call Loan Rates and Auxiliary Coinage Remain Calm</p>
<p>Recently, the foreign exchange market of banks has been affected by tension. Trading among financial institutions has been reluctant to proceed, resulting in a dull and stagnant situation. Yesterday was also Sunday, making the market even more desolate. The call loan rate in the foreign exchange market remained at 1.8% in both the morning and afternoon, unchanged from the previous day. Call loan transactions amounted to over 2.5 million in the morning trading, with new transactions exceeding 300,000. Afternoon trading was quiet. Transactions in the Small General Association totaled over 500,000. Money shops remitted over 18 million in foreign public notes, with remittances from various routes exceeding 200,000. Inflow from other sources was over 100,000. Transactions in foreign exchange suppression were over 100,000. There were no banknote transactions for withdrawals; in terms of issuance, only privately marked notes amounted to over 400,000, with no news of other transactions. As for auxiliary coinage, the situation was also very calm. The price of Jiangnan small silver coins was 817 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets, the same as the previous day, with 4,000 jiao transacted in the morning and none in the afternoon. The price of Guangdong small silver coins was 735.5 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets, a slight increase of 5 jiao from the previous day, with 80,000 jiao transacted in the morning and 30,000 jiao in the afternoon. The silver dollar market also remained unchanged from the previous day, with both the morning and afternoon markets opening at 336,000 wen. The transaction volume was 36,096 strings of wen, equivalent to 11,000 yuan in foreign currency.</p>

<p>A Dramatic Drop of Two to Six Yuan   Salt Tax Suspended Trading As a Result   96 Northern Faction Bonds Rose Instead</p>
<p>Last week, the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Exchange experienced another startling drop in the market. The entire week was turbulent, with all bonds hitting new lows since the Fujian Incident. Although the closing price at the end of the week rebounded by one and a half yuan due to short covering, the market price ultimately plummeted by a significant two to over six yuan compared to the previous weekend. The daily progression throughout the week showed a drop of one yuan during the first two days amid financial uncertainty. There was no market on Wednesday due to the Dragon Boat Festival, and Thursday was uneventful. On the weekend, financial institutions and the Northern Faction engaged in large-scale selling, causing the market price to plummet by four to five yuan in two days. Salt tax even suspended trading due to the sharp drop, while other bonds also fell significantly, all hitting new lows since the Fujian Incident. Although there was a rebound later, it was not a formal turnaround. However, the 96 Public Bond stood out, rising by a significant one yuan throughout the week due to short covering by Northern Faction investors, which is noteworthy amidst the overall market decline. Looking at the past week, sellers did not stop even as market prices fell lower, selling even more aggressively, indicating a clear objective. The total turnover for the entire week was extremely high, reaching a substantial 153.7 million yuan in five days.</p>

<p>A Rapid Rebound of Over Twenty Points After the Drop</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with limited transactions due to uncertainty among traders, and prices for all months fell by 5 to 7 points. Liquidations by bulls and sales by foreign merchants also contributed to the decline. Subsequently, traders, the government, and Japanese merchants all made purchases. It was reported that the leader of the Senate Agriculture Committee proposed a loan of 1.2 cents per pound, and short sellers of the October contract aggressively covered their positions, leading to a rapid price increase. There were few transaction contracts, and exports from the South were also low. However, current demand and exports remained weak. The market closed firm, with spot prices rising by 25 points and futures prices rising by 17 to 26 points. The British cotton market was closed. Short sellers of Indian cotton covered their positions, and the market was narrow. Bengal fell by 0.25 to 0.75 rupees, Oomra fell by 0.25 to 1 rupee, and Broach fell by 1 to 1.15 rupees.

<p>— Ji Jilin</p>
<p>I recently read Mr. Wang Qizhang's masterpiece, "An Observation on the Statistics of Medical and Pharmaceutical Supplements in Local Newspapers," published in this publication. It is known that there are as many as sixteen kinds of regular medical and pharmaceutical publications in local newspapers, in addition to old medicine, which is quite a spectacle. My medical colleagues are enthusiastic about promoting medical and health knowledge. The crisis of our nation has reached its extreme. We are living in deep water and fire. Our lives are as fragile as a thread. The oppression of politics and economy is self-evident. Even population pressure is a serious problem. The cause of population pressure is often attributed to natural and man-made disasters. In fact, natural and man-made disasters are not insurmountable. However, due to the underdevelopment of medical and pharmaceutical undertakings, the lack of active health construction, and the lack of popularization of scientific medical knowledge, people die in droves and await death helplessly. Therefore, if we want to save the nation from danger, we should fight and struggle to find a way out from the oppression of politics and economy. The medical and health undertakings, which are closely related to the population problem, are also urgent tasks that cannot be ignored. There are many ways to study medicine and health, but it is most important to make the public understand the importance of medicine and health, so that they can generate power from faith. Therefore, written publicity is a necessary way. This is what my colleagues in the industry have to contribute to society in their spare time. Moreover, the current medical situation in our country is very complicated. There is new medicine based on science, and there is also mysterious and false old medicine. The advantages and disadvantages of the old and new coexist in society. The general public is confused and has no correct understanding. Even those in power in the temple are ambiguous and do not know what to do. They know the value of science, but also believe in the fallacies of old medicine. What could be more contradictory? Therefore, my colleagues in the industry, in order to make the society recognize the value of scientific new medicine and correct the conservative concepts of the public, must also promote medical and health knowledge. In recent years, social views have gradually changed. The contribution of publicity cannot be denied. However, if we observe with a strict eye, we will know that among the medical and pharmaceutical texts promoted in various newspapers today, there are many that have pure purposes and accurate arguments, but there are also those that are questionable. I, as a writer, embrace the meaning of Spring and Autumn criticism of the wise, and I cannot help but speak out about what I think is dangerous. For example, in the "Correspondence and Asking for Medical Advice" column of a certain medical publication, whether the drugs introduced in the answers are suitable for the patient is questionable. Moreover, most of the drugs are products of foreign merchants, and they are discarded like worn-out shoes for Chinese-made drugs with the same efficacy, and they are unwilling to introduce them. This makes our country's leak bigger and bigger, and we are willing to be the vanguard of foreign drugs. How can my medical colleagues not see this? Others, such as a certain medical publication, claim that certain dangerous diseases can only be cured by seeking treatment at a certain hospital or a certain doctor (in fact, the editor of the publication) to turn danger into safety. Academic attainments have their own depths, but to exaggerate one's own treatment achievements or to exaggerate words in order to attract patients is like a merchant. Its means are very despicable, and its intentions are even more questionable. How will the society regard our new doctors? May I ask if anyone will pay attention to the publicity of medical texts in the future? I dare to advise my colleagues in the industry that the purpose of publicizing medical and health knowledge must be pure, and the concept must not be for oneself, so that we can be righteous and speak loudly. Those who have knowledge will have firm faith. The promotion of medical and health undertakings will be rapid. Otherwise, one horse will harm the group, and other good publications will also be despised and perish together. A glimmer of dawn in the new medical community will be extinguished. Obstructing the development of new medicine and the survival of the nation is truly unbearable to say.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Beer Barrel and Seesaw <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Yue Qi</p>
<p>—One of the Medical Stories—</p>
<p>Various diagnostic methods for determining the symptoms of the lungs are now very complete; and "percussion" and "auscultation" are the most common and basic methods. Percussion is tapping the chest with fingers, and auscultation is listening to the chest with a stethoscope. Both use the doctor's sensitive hearing to distinguish the symptoms of the lungs from outside the skin. But the origin of these two diagnostic methods is quite an interesting story.</p>
<p>The birthplace of percussion was in the yard of a small inn in Graz, Austria, in the mid-18th century. The name of this small inn was Zum Swartzen Mohren, which means "marked by a Moorish black woman." The innkeeper's name was Auentruger, and his son's name was Leopold. He was born on November 19, 1722. After Leopold grew up, he helped his father manage the store. This inn also sold beer: the beer was stored in wooden barrels, and when it was needed, the wine would flow out as long as the plug on the side of the barrel was pulled out. Knowing how much wine was left in the barrel was very important economically. The barrel was made of wood, so how could people see the wine inside? But the young Leopold learned a method from his father, which, although not very accurate, was very simple. He stood the wine barrel firmly and tapped the side of the barrel with his palm from top to bottom. At the top, because there was only air and no wine inside, the tone was low: when he tapped to the place where there was wine inside, the tone suddenly became much higher.</p>
<p>Later, Leopold volunteered to study medicine, studied at the University of Vienna, and achieved good results; after practicing medicine, his reputation became increasingly prominent, and the king hired him as a royal physician. One day, one of his patients died. At that time, the practice of dissecting corpses had begun to prevail; he dissected the patient's corpse and found a liquid—pus—stored in the chest: this was a symptom he had not expected. So he thought to himself: why didn't he think that the patient's chest contained liquid when the patient was still alive? What method can be used to investigate whether there is liquid in the patient's chest? Suddenly, the scene of his father tapping the wine barrel with his hand appeared in his mind. The chest storing liquid is similar to a wooden barrel containing wine. The opaque skin is like the barrel wall; inside there is air at the top and liquid at the bottom. He decided to try it. From then on, whenever a patient called him to diagnose, he would gently tap his chest with his fingers and listen to the sound. This method was actually effective. By this method, he could find the liquid in the patient's chest, and occasionally find the consolidation of pulmonary tuberculosis and pneumonia. He called this method Percussicn, which means "percussion," and published an article in 1761 with the title of new invention.</p>
<p>Before that, no one had thought of "listening" to the sounds caused by air entering and leaving the lungs, or the sounds made by the heart pumping. This was invented unintentionally by another doctor in 1814.</p>
<p>One day, a French doctor named Rene Theophile Hjaeintbe Laemec was walking near the Nick Hospital in Paris. He was thin and frail, but he was the busiest and most fashionable doctor in Paris. The hospital was full of soldiers from the army. Most of them died of pulmonary tuberculosis. This kind doctor walked and thought: If there was a way to diagnose this disease early, the treatment would definitely be much easier. He inadvertently saw a group of children playing seesaw. They were not playing the usual seesaw game, but using the seesaw to "send telegrams." One put his ear to one end of the board to listen, and the other scratched the other end of the board with a needle; they still used their own "code" to scratch and listen, so as to transmit messages. The clever Laennec was suddenly inspired: If he used a wooden tube to press against his chest to listen, he might be able to hear the sound. He tried it, and there was indeed a sound. He recorded the various sounds he heard from the chests of various patients and compared the meanings of the various sounds from the corpse dissection, and he was actually successful. He was the founder of the stethoscope; his bronze statue still stands in the market square of Buimper.</p>
<h3 id="e176">The Consultation Fee for the Last Illness <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>The so-called "last illness" is the last illness in a person's life. In other words, it is the illness that sends them to their death. The last illness is something that everyone must go through, and it is also something that every doctor will inevitably encounter in the process of treating a certain number of patients. However, patients' families often take advantage of the patient's death to avoid paying the consultation fee. If the doctor tries to recover it, the patient's family will accuse the doctor of manslaughter and sue the doctor in court. Eight or nine out of ten medical disputes arise from recovering the consultation fee for the last illness. Therefore, the consultation fee for the last illness has become the most important issue for discussion between doctors and patients! Please discuss it in detail:</p>
<p>The consultation fee is a kind of compensation for the doctor's hard work. Its acceptance and payment are absolutely unrelated to the good or bad outcome of the disease, because seeing a doctor is a contract, and both the doctor and the patient have their own obligations to fulfill. Seeing a doctor is the doctor's obligation, and paying the consultation fee is the patient's family's obligation. If one party fails to fulfill their obligation, this clearly breaks the establishment of the contract. What is the definition of seeing a doctor? It is to sincerely and wholeheartedly relieve the patient's pain and do everything possible in terms of treatment. However, when encountering incurable diseases, bad outcomes occur, which no one can be responsible for. There is no such thing as a magical doctor who guarantees a cure in the world, and there is no such thing as a profession that works without pay. Can a small amount of consultation fee be considered the price of a patient's life? Nowadays, people in society often misunderstand this point and think that once they pay the consultation fee, they hope that the doctor will guarantee a cure. If the patient dies, they all think that it is due to the doctor's failure and not the disease, and use this as an excuse to avoid paying the consultation fee. Isn't this fundamentally wrong?</p>
<p>Since the definitions of consultation fee and seeing a doctor are as described above, then the consultation fee for the last illness should undoubtedly be paid. In Western countries, there are strict legal provisions for this consultation fee for the last illness. For example, Article 1201 of the French Civil Code states in essence:</p>
<p>"No matter what the outcome of the patient is, the patient's family or the deceased's heirs must pay the consultation fee for the last illness. Even if the patient's family goes bankrupt or sells their property, the doctor has the right to be paid first."</p>
<p>What should be noted in this law is the phrase "no matter what the outcome of the patient is," because no one can avoid death, and doctors cannot avoid treating the last illness. The meaning of this sentence is to prevent the patient's family from using the good or bad outcome of the disease as the standard for whether or not to pay the consultation fee. As for still having to repay even if bankrupt, this undoubtedly fears that the patient's family does not know that the consultation fee must be paid, and also prevents the patient's family from delaying or making excuses by saying that their income is insufficient or that they have gone bankrupt. From this point of view, the consultation fee is a kind of debt that the patient's family owes to the doctor, and the doctor is in the position of a prior creditor to the patient's family who has not paid the consultation fee! The legal knowledge of our people is shallower than that of advanced Western countries, and they do not know that paying the consultation fee is the patient's family's obligation. Our country's laws are also inevitably incomplete, so I have specially raised the issue of the consultation fee for the last illness for discussion in order to be selected by the legislators. This is also a way to protect the medical profession and reduce disputes between doctors and patients!</p>

<p>(50) Eye Diseases Caused by Diabetes (Continued)</p>
<p>Diabetes, also known as consumption disease. Our country has known about it for a long time in the past. According to historical records, Sima Xiangru also suffered from it. The reason why old doctors named it consumption disease is that patients need to drink a lot of water due to the excessive amount of sugar in their blood, so that the sugar can be excreted by the kidneys. Because of this, patients often feel thirsty, and because a large amount of glucose cannot be used by the body and is excreted, the body's nutrition is affected and they gradually become thin. This is completely based on the symptoms of the disease. Pathologically speaking, the real cause of diabetes is the lesion of the Langerhans islands in the pancreas, resulting in the lack of secretions of the Langerhans islands (insulin) in the body. The function of insulin is to make liver sugar into glucose and to analyze and burn glucose to generate heat and energy. Once insulin is lacking, sugar in the blood cannot be burned and accumulates in the blood. Because blood has to maintain its inherent composition, it must excrete the increased sugar through the kidneys, otherwise hyperglycemia will occur. The symptoms of diabetes are roughly: polyuria, gluttony, easy hunger, often need to drink a lot of water due to thirst, people gradually become thin and feel exhausted. Most of the patients are upper-class people who often eat refined foods and exercise less. This disease does have a hereditary relationship. In addition, obesity and gout can also cause it. The causes of obesity and gout are all due to eating too much food rich in protein and fat, and the person is less active. These people often feel comfortable in life, and it is difficult to feel polyuria, gluttony, easy hunger, thirst, and drinking a lot, but because of good nutrition, they do not lose weight, so they often suffer from the disease for a long time without realizing it. Most of them are found only after physical examination and urine examination. If it is a mild disease, it does not matter much, but if it is severe, it may cause diabetic coma (Kema Diabeticum) and may be life-threatening. Therefore, if diabetes can be detected early, and attention is paid to diet, there is no danger to life. Now, in addition to the sugar content in urine that is generally known, the changes in the visual organs caused by diabetes can also be used as an aid to early diagnosis. Common visual organ lesions are oculomotor nerve palsy, eye rigidity, which can cause needle vision or have regulation, paralysis and bismuth nerve atrophy, resulting in weakened vision, double vision or blindness. Sometimes it can cause cataracts, called diabetic cataracts (Katarakta Diabetika), which cause visual impairment and blindness. The most important thing in early diagnosis is indeed diabetic retinitis (Retinitfs Diabetica). The main subjective aspect of this disease is initially only weakened vision, or slight visual impairment, or even no feeling at all. It must be examined by a specialist ophthalmologist to see the retina, there are bright white spots, very similar to proteinuria retinitis, often mistaken for kidney inflammation proteinuria caused by, in fact, it is due to the relationship of diabetes. From this, we can know that fundus examination can not only diagnose eye diseases, but also can detect changes in the eyes caused by internal diseases. Generally, people think that eye diseases are local diseases and do not pay attention to them. In fact, many eye diseases have a close relationship with internal diseases. For example, diabetes mentioned today, in addition, kidney inflammation, leukemia (Leukamie), etc., can be diagnosed accurately through fundus examination in the early stage.</p>

<p>Urogenital disorders such as kidney disease and testicular disease.</p>
<p>Furthermore, diseases of various internal organs such as hepatitis, liver atrophy, lungs, pancreas, and spleen. The insidious harm and bizarre transformations are truly beyond description. What is described here is only a brief overview. As for the above diseases, each has its own characteristics. I deeply fear generating unnecessary details and dazzling the senses, so they are also omitted.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is necessary to describe the symptoms of congenital syphilis. According to congenital syphilitic fetuses, they often die in utero from damage caused by syphilitic pathogens and are aborted, or are born prematurely with various syphilitic lesions. Therefore, the nutrition and development of the fetus are very poor, and the skin is scaly, white, dry, or prematurely dirty, yellowish-white, and full of wrinkles, resembling an old man. As for the invasion of various organs, the infiltration of the skin can cause blisters on the palms and soles, i.e., pemphigus-like syphilitic rash. Also, the fissures in the infiltrated area around the mouth leave radiating scars, i.e., the so-called Parrot's furrows. In mucosal lesions, rhinitis can obstruct breathing and make breastfeeding difficult, or destroy nasal cartilage and bone, leading to a sunken nasal bridge (saddle nose – shaped like a saddle). Furthermore, hair loss, or inflammation of the bones and periosteum of the limbs, can present as a state of pseudo-paralysis, i.e., Parrot's pseudo-paralysis. As for the nervous system, encephalitis, meningitis, idiocy, epilepsy, etc., may occur in abundance. There is also the so-called Hutchinson's triad, which is a unique symptom of late-onset congenital syphilis, namely (1) malformed permanent teeth with short, narrow, and thin upper incisors, with a semi-lunar notch on the lower edge; (2) keratitis of the eye; and (3) ear disorders. Syphilis symptoms are like this. Clear-eyed people should be able to imagine the magnitude of its harm.</p>
<p>Chapter 6: The Value and Recent Progress of Syphilis Diagnosis</p>
<p>After contracting syphilis, it not only invades oneself and close relatives, but also harms future generations without end. It goes without saying that syphilis must be thoroughly treated. However, we already know that the changes in this disease are so numerous that they crown all diseases. Therefore, the diagnosis of this disease requires detailed investigation to fully understand its capabilities. This is something that those who hope to fundamentally eliminate syphilis must know.</p>
<p>Before the discovery of 606, the main symptom of syphilis was skin rash. Therefore, opinions... After the discovery of 606, skin symptoms decreased significantly. There are often cases where no skin rash appears after the first stage. This is especially true for those in large cities who have some basic knowledge of venereal diseases. However, who knows if the symptoms on the surface have subsided, but the toxicity still exists? Therefore, even doctors can know the general idea based on the patient's past history and current symptoms. Even if the patient has undergone treatment and the symptoms have lessened, a thorough diagnosis is still necessary. Do not neglect it.</p>
<p>The diagnostic methods include (1) bacteriological examination – to detect the presence or absence of the pathogenic bacteria of this disease; (2) histological observation – to examine the changes in tissues and determine whether they are syphilitic; (3) optical fluoroscopy – to examine lesions in deep organs. Furthermore, it is necessary to perform</p>

<h3 id="e179">Medical Pain Relief (18) <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Li Xing</p>
<p>Furuncles, Carbuncles, Cellulitis, Abscesses</p>
<p>There are several painful skin and flesh ailments, sometimes very dangerous. What patients want is pain relief, and doctors should also relieve patients' pain, reducing pain where possible and eliminating danger where possible. Although patients want pain relief, they must also consider the safety of their lives.</p>
<p>Furuncles are localized skin inflammation, mostly healing gradually after suppuration. The cause is staphylococcus bacteria growing in hair follicles or skin sebaceous glands. Some people have furuncles all year round, appearing one after another, mostly due to impaired kidney excretion, diabetes, or impaired sugar metabolism in the body.</p>
<p>Furuncles are usually not very large, and the pain is limited, mostly without danger. At the beginning of a furuncle, using saturated magnesium sulfate solution to soak a cloth pad and applying hot and cold compresses can significantly benefit pain relief and swelling reduction. Doing this several times a day may hopefully resolve the furuncle. It is also acceptable to apply pain-relieving ointment or pain-relieving lotion. There are two more things to pay attention to regarding furuncles, namely: (1) be sure to protect the furuncle from injury, as injury can enlarge the furuncle and allow bacteria to enter the blood, causing danger. (2) When the furuncle is ripe and contains pus, it must be cut open to release the pus. Do not be afraid of temporary minor pain. If the pus is not released, the pus in the furuncle is easily absorbed by the blood and transported to other parts of the body, which can cause sores and inflammation, and if transported to the kidneys, it can cause nephritis. Cutting open a furuncle to release pus is also a pain-relieving method. Without cutting, the furuncle is tense and painful; after cutting, the tension disappears and the pain stops naturally.</p>
<p>Carbuncles are a type of gangrene in the skin and flesh, due to localized invasion of pus-producing staphylococcus bacteria. Patients are mostly those with low physical resistance. Those with kidney disease and diabetes are more prone to carbuncles. Carbuncles initially become hard and painful, with the skin on the carbuncle turning red and gray, and the swelling gradually expanding to the size of a rice bowl is not uncommon. The most common sites for furuncles are the neck, back, shoulders, and buttocks, because these areas have lower tissue resistance.</p>
<p>Carbuncles on the face are commonly called "boils." Most people also know that boils are dangerous. As for why boils are dangerous, they cannot explain why, but they know that some people die from boils. We know that the blood flow in the face is very abundant, and part of the blood return in the face first goes to the base of the brain through the veins and then returns to the heart. Blood clots often form from bacteria in the veins of the carbuncle, causing inflammation to spread to the large veins at the base of the brain. If the large veins at the base of the brain are invaded by bacteria and become purulent, the disease cannot be cured. Once there are venous blood clots, toxic bacteria can easily enter the blood. Bacterial invasion of the blood is also a difficult disease to cure. Bacterial invasion of the large veins at the base of the brain is a particular danger of facial carbuncles (boils). Bacterial invasion of the blood is a danger that can be caused by any carbuncle.</p>
<p>Since carbuncles are so dangerous, the treatment should be based on two goals: first, to relieve pain. Doctors should always relieve patients' pain within possible limits. Pain relief should use local methods and not systemic methods. Note that injecting anesthetics and taking pain-relieving pills are systemic methods. We know that carbuncles are a very dangerous disease with a very high mortality rate, so the patient's complete physical resistance should be preserved. Anesthetics and pain-relieving pills often reduce physical resistance. In the face of a dangerous disease, a fraction of resistance is of great importance to life and death. Do not recklessly seek temporary pain relief and destroy the chance of survival.</p>

<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>In the treatment of pneumothorax, in addition to the patient needing absolute rest, all physical examination work must be reduced as much as possible; the use of anesthetics is also necessary, but most are not very effective. Relieving dyspnea is the most important task, and the most important aspect of this is the aspiration of air from the chest cavity! This is not a very easy operation, and doctors should proceed with caution. If there is excessive effusion, perform a thoracentesis; for pyopneumothorax, repeated thoracentesis should be performed, or ordinary surgical drainage for empyema can also be used, but attention should be paid to tuberculosis patients.</p>
<p>Section 4: Digestive Tract</p>
<p>Regarding complications of the digestive tract, intestinal tuberculosis is the most important! The number of its sufferers is truly staggering; according to pathologists' reports, in the overall population of tuberculosis patients, almost more than 50% are also suffering from intestinal tuberculosis. It is found after severe open tuberculosis: not to mention exudative types, even proliferative ulcerative types are the same. Its occurrence is mostly caused by the sputum coughed up by pulmonary tuberculosis patients being swallowed from the throat and reaching the intestines; the tuberculosis bacteria in the sputum are of course its medium! In addition, primary intestinal tuberculosis is also possible; such as the ingestion of tuberculous milk, uncooked tuberculous animal meat, and the careless use of utensils by tuberculosis patients are all very obvious causes: this situation has already been briefly mentioned in the "Foodborne Transmission" section of Chapter 2 of this book; I think readers can probably still recall it.</p>

<p>Nowadays, all kinds of writing instruments are truly improving day by day, and the manufacturing is becoming more and more refined. However, I think this is not a good phenomenon in terms of culture: because although the writing instruments are good, the production of articles has not made new progress so far. Then, what's the use of merely holding a "silver-like wax gun head"!</p>
<p>When a car is on the way and the engine malfunctions, stopping its progress, it is called "breaking down": when a ship is sailing on the waterway and the engine breaks down, unable to move forward, it is called "inserting candles". I think that reversing the two terms (this so-called term is my arbitrary decision) would be more correct, but the general public insists on misidentifying them to the end, I don't know why? Therefore, all things in society that subvert right and wrong can be viewed in this way.</p>

<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>I have a friend who is in the education field, and he is very dedicated to the newly emerging literacy movement. Yesterday I met him again and asked him how effective his efforts were in persuading illiterate people to learn to read. He shook his head, sighed, and said, "Difficult!"</p>
<p>He said, "In my neighbor's house, an old nanny, about thirty years old, is employed. I thought it was very important to have her learn some words, so I taught her three words every day after my classes, along with her work breaks. I thought that in this way, after a year, she could recognize about a thousand words."</p>
<p>"I taught her so seriously, and she read very seriously too. But after a week, the old nanny refused me for no reason. Afterwards, I learned that her mistress said that the old nanny was getting too close to me and wanted to stop her business."</p>
<p>"At the same time, I also taught the rickshaw puller across the street every day. I also planned to teach him to recognize a thousand words in a year. Who knew that his master was a businessman who ate gold and had not even finished three years of schooling, and was afraid that the rickshaw puller would know too many words, which would undermine his glory, so he forced the rickshaw puller to stop learning by ridiculing and threatening him."</p>
<p>"In a leather craftsman's stall in the alley, there were two apprentices, both of whom had never read a book in their lives, so I thought I would teach them three words each every day. After teaching them for three days, they stopped reading. When asked for the reason, they said that time is more precious than anything else to craftsmen. Although reading three words every day doesn't seem to take much time, if you count it for a quarter of an hour every day, you would have to do a lot less work for a month. Craftsmen would starve if they stopped working, so how could they have time to learn to read?"</p>
<p>"Also, there was a maid in a wealthy family in the alley. I had only taught her to recognize six words, and she was punished by her mistress by being starved for a day." He said dejectedly, "In this day and age, it is still very difficult to promote the literacy movement."</p>
<p>But in the end, he still said very firmly, "No matter what, I will still work hard!"</p>

<p>At the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Fuzhou Road, there is the Italian Postal Shipping Company. In its street-facing glass window, a postal ship model is displayed, about ten feet in length, with realistic construction and exquisite craftsmanship, truly a concrete and miniature representation. Those who catch a glimpse of it for the first time have their minds wander to the land of water and clouds, yearn for the scenery of foreign countries, and seem to have placed themselves in the realm of extreme material enjoyment, unable to contain the joy of returning home, and often marvel at its perfect craftsmanship, lingering and looking around, unable to leave. Connoisseurs say: "The creation of this model is entirely based on the original ship, and its ability to sail is as desired; the cost has reached twenty thousand gold yuan." Westerners spare no effort and expense in their business promotion, to this extent! Today, the Italians exclusively hold the hegemony of Eurasian water transport, can it be without reason?</p>
<p>Looking back at our country, shipping and transportation are left to foreigners to overstep their boundaries without competition, and those sailing to foreign oceans do not even have a single ship. Even the small achievements that have been made are those who compete for profit and engage in infighting, and will not stop until they are completely destroyed. As for the new ships purchased with embezzled funds by those who are greedy and boast to the people, examining their usefulness, I wonder if they can surpass this postal ship model in any way? It's just that no one has compared them!</p>
<p>Alas! This is the shame of our people!</p>

<p>Chapter 14: A Westerner Talks About Construction, Not Without Regret; A Poor Scholar Yearns for Love</p>
<p>You Rong picked up the cartoon and looked at it. It depicted a highway with a large Pigsy wielding a large nail rake, digging the road forward. In front of the road was dense undergrowth, but in the opened-up highway area, there were people coming and going, all with high noses, occasionally mixed with a few wearing cloth shoes. The people coming each carried an empty pocket, with the one in the front holding a flag that read "Go to Northwest China." The people going, on the other hand, were different. Each person's pocket was swollen like a toad's belly. There was the letter "F" on the pocket. The person in front raised his thumb, and two curved lines came out of his mouth, with words written in the lines: "The impression is very good, construction is progressing." You Rong looked at it, put it down, and clapped his hands and laughed: "The meaning is very good. But I suspect you are reversing the car, opposing the construction of the highway." Zhiqian laughed: "You are studying politics, and I am acting as a pro-people official, you might as well come and solve this problem. The facts are laid out here. Whether transportation is convenient or not, in China, the proportion of foreign economic aggression becomes formal. Now, in Xi'an city, buying a bottle of beer costs more than one yuan, and a bottle of brandy costs twelve or thirteen yuan. Of course, the middle class doesn't dare to ask about it. In the future, when the train reaches outside the North Gate of Xi'an, beer can be sold for four or five mao, and brandy can also be sold for four or five yuan, and more people will drink it. The top-quality imported goods, before the train reached Tongguan and the car could not reach Xi'an, could only be bought in a few stores in Xi'an city. Since the train has reached Tongguan and the highway has reached Xi'an, this has undergone a great change. Several three-story foreign-style buildings have been built in Nan Yuan Men, all selling foreign goods. The foreign goods that can be bought in Kaifeng and Zhengzhou can also be bought slowly here."

<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shou Ou</p>
<p>Just because of this exchange, the Empress Dowager's appearance also changed greatly. She seemed to have lost twenty years of age all at once, as if she had returned to her youth. Her spirit was more lively than those of us young people, and her every word and action was so light and quick that it was almost indescribable. What was the reason for this? Actually, there was no particular reason, only that in the recent days, all the political affairs in the court had been going very smoothly, without anything that could make her angry or sad, and today was particularly free, without any major matters that she had to take care of herself, so she was especially happy. Really, her good complexion today would definitely make it very suitable to wear the pair of jade earrings and the pair of white jade bracelets offered by Zhang Zhidong. However, although I thought of this, the Empress Dowager herself did not express it, perhaps because she didn't think of it at that moment.</p>
<p>"Today, we must think of a more interesting way to play...! Let's go to Kunming Lake!" Her lively mood could no longer allow her to sit still, so she decided to go out and play, first expressing to us: "With such good weather, we must have a good time for most of the day: isn't it very interesting to be on the water? Even our lunch must be ordered to be brought to the boat, otherwise we won't be able to enjoy ourselves!"</p>
<p>Of course, we were all happy to hear this and eagerly obeyed the order. Before setting off, the eight of us lady officials specially gathered quietly and held a five-minute meeting. (325)</p>
<p>Errata: In Chapter 8, the word "之" above "A Floating Palace on the Lake" was mistakenly printed as "江". We hereby correct it.</p>

<h3 id="e188">The Unfinished Painting <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Yafei</p>
<p>In order to tidy up my bookshelf, I discovered a painting scroll in the corner of the cabinet. It was a "Willow Creek Angling" picture. But regrettably, it was only half finished, and my father had passed away before he could complete it! He has been gone for twenty years now, but since my mother gave me that unfinished painting, I have carefully kept it hidden in the bookshelf. I remember my mother saying to me with tears in her eyes at the time:</p>
<p>"Fei, this painting is your father's last possession and his only legacy. Because you were still young when he died and didn't understand anything, I'm giving you this painting now. You must carefully keep it as a memento of your father!" My mother cried as she spoke. Although I didn't know my father and don't remember his death, I do miss him very much.</p>
<p>I am now a father myself, and I can't help but feel somewhat afraid because my mother often told me that my father died very young, worn down by life. It makes me worry. Am I not young now? And the grindstone of life is already pressing down on my shoulders!</p>
<p>My father was originally a very lively and energetic young man, but later, due to life, burdens, and many unpleasant attacks, he became depressed and melancholy. And soon he contracted a lung disease. At that time, my mother and relatives comforted him like this:</p>
<p>"You should understand and not worry too much. Life still has to be lived, and your health is also important!" But he was very stubborn and didn't believe he would die.</p>
<p>"No, I cannot rest. For the sake of life, I must repay debts. I can't let the children go hungry, and debts cannot lose credibility. Can lung disease destroy my future and stop my struggle?" His tone was so firm, so courageous, not at all like a person with lung disease who was dying.</p>
<p>Life pressed tighter and tighter on him day by day, the debts never decreased, and the pressure on his shoulders grew heavier. So he began to doubt: "Has my future really been destroyed by lung disease? Can it really stop my final struggle? But life still has to go on! The debts still have to be repaid!" He doubted and dared not trust his own courage, and even grieved over the failure of his various struggles. "Alas! Has my ideal been completely shattered? Is there no hope at all?" Although he still didn't quite believe it, when he looked at the darkness around him, he felt that everything was empty.</p>
<p>Day after day, month after month, year after year, time flew quickly in his life. His lung disease gradually worsened with the passage of time, and his sorrow also increased with the lung disease. Every morning he had to cough up a lot of phlegm, often had night sweats and insomnia, his appetite was reduced by half, and his face was frighteningly pale. His cheekbones were high, his eyes were sunken, and if he lay on a wooden plank, people would surely suspect that he was no longer breathing.</p>
<p>Because there was no money, he was never treated. Although he took many folk remedies, they were like stones sinking into the sea, with no effect at all! My mother was very anxious, but what could she do? She could only watch helplessly as my father became weaker and weaker day by day. Finally, on a spring afternoon, he left us and left behind that final work he had created while ill – the unfinished painting – and departed!</p>
<p>Now, whenever I unfold this painting, I think of my deceased father, and at the same time, my tear ducts cannot help but erupt like a mountain flood!</p>
<p>"My father was worn down by life and died so young. I don't want to be like my father!" Now, whenever I think of these things, I tremble!</p>

<h3 id="e189">Peace and War <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>Recently, a Belgian socialist leader, Mr. Vandervelde, gave a speech at a women's congress of the party, saying: "The world is currently at a crossroads, on the one hand, pursuing a policy of peace and disarmament, and on the other hand, continuing to engage in</p>
<p>Mr. Fan's words are very good. The world today is turbulent, hesitating at the crossroads of peace and war, presenting an extremely precarious and uneasy state. On the surface, all countries in the world seem to be deeply committed to peace. Their great powers are constantly running around and shouting out the tones of peace and disarmament. But in reality, everyone is fiercely competing in armaments under the mask of peace. A great misfortune for humanity is bound to come sooner or later.</p>
<p>However, although there are many ambitious politicians and military personnel in power in the world today who are frantically preparing for war, the general public truly loathes war and loves peace. As a practical example, recently the United Kingdom launched a peace voting movement, posing five questions and holding a public referendum. The results showed that the majority of the two million British people who participated in the vote were inclined towards peace. This is clear proof of the people's love of peace.</p>
<p>But the people's love of peace is useless, and world war is still unavoidable. The day before yesterday, two American journalists familiar with international affairs made a prediction about world war, saying that the world's military preparations are now too heavy, like a large powder keg that can be detonated even by a very fine fuse. This observation is now very accurate.</p>
<p>Therefore, although the world is still a world of peace, this world of peace cannot be maintained for long. As long as the countries are strong enough and the time is right, the second great massacre will begin. At that time, this world of peace will turn into a world of war.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Seaside <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Ai Tu</p>
<p>In the daytime, the scorching sun seems to burn everything on the seashore like fire, but everything on the seashore will never dry up. It is always oozing with yellow, gluey liquid, soaked by the sea water. However, often, the river that surrounds our garden often evaporates white light smoke like a red thread. Indeed, the water is about to reach the boiling point, and the fish raised in the river are also steamed to death, many floating on the surface, exuding a fishy and rancid smell, wave after wave swept into our souls with the sultry wind. Every summer, the southern seashore is like this. From morning to dusk, everything is burned by flames. Once, the weather was so terribly hot:</p>
<p>"It's going to rain, and this time it's going to be a big storm."</p>
<p>Sure enough, when the sun was setting in the west with flames, black clouds swung fearfully in the sky. Then came a rare, violent sea breeze, howling. After we finished our work, we cooked dinner in the thatched hut as usual, ate a large plate of green vegetables and some fish and shrimp, and drank plain soup cooked with salt water. At this moment, the black sky thundered terribly, crackling.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid we won't be able to sleep comfortably tonight. The storm has arrived."</p>
<p>As I spoke, Ah Hui and I began to patch up the gaps in the thatched hut. Because this thatched hut was also built by ourselves with old bricks and tiles and some palm leaves. It was very small and a bit like the dwellings of ancient hunters. Of course, it was not very strong, and it could not withstand the destruction of terrible storms. Moreover, experience told us that violent wind and rain would blow away the palm leaves on the roof of the thatched hut.</p>
<p>It was dark, and we were lying on the plank bed in the narrow thatched hut, trying to sleep. At this time, the wind became louder and more terrible, like a roaring tiger. The dog outside the door was barking, wagging its tail with a terrified look – at this time, the universe was desolate, especially on the desolate seashore, as if it were in the world of ghosts, and the surging waves were rolling endlessly. However, we were very tired, so what did we care about such a big storm? So, we fell asleep in the shaking of the thatched hut.</p>
<p>When our faces were wet with rain and we felt as cold as winter, we woke up in shock.</p>
<p>"Ah Hui, the palm leaves on the roof have been blown up by the wind. Fix it quickly."</p>
<p>So, we immediately lit the kerosene lamp, found a rope, and climbed onto the roof in the pouring rain with our shoulders bare. We repaired it for our lives, enduring the whippings of the wind and rain. At this time, the sky was all dark, thundering, and flashing lightning like long snakes. We were anxious, and our bodies felt terribly cold. After a long struggle, we finally repaired the thatched hut, but our bed was soaked.</p>
<p>It was another desolate nocturne, and we fell asleep tiredly. When the sun came out from the east with bright colors the next morning, we started living that same ordinary work again.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Night Talk <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Mansha</p>
<p>The distant long night covered her black veil from the starlight in the sky, and the nerves awakened from the exhaustion of the long day. Watching the empty tomb in the room, and when the lonely soul was tightly grasped by the lonely black hand, it suddenly sank into the lively memories of the past. What lively and interesting nights there were in the past!</p>
<p>It was the summer of the village, and the south wind brought the coolness of the South Sea. Under the melon trellis illuminated by the moon, how lively and interesting it was! My mother took a group of children, and the brothers and sisters were all immersed in touching stories. The mysterious night brought a mysterious atmosphere, and the actions of ghosts and foxes told in the stories frightened the small bodies to shrink and tremble. Now, the group of children have all become adults. The sisters have been married off, and the brothers are all running around for life. This night talk under the summer moon is no longer recoverable. I wanted to regain the fascinating power from the trembling stories, but this fantasy obviously cannot be reproduced. But at the same time, the good taste of this night talk sprouted from my heart and made me remember many times the taste of night talks.</p>
<p>On a certain shore of the South Sea, the sea tide slammed against the stone reef, roaring. The wind blew the huge tide advancing northward. Several of us young people were locked in a small building in a seaside hut, facing the small window for a long night of conversation. The flames of all life's topics burned from our deep hearts; we talked about the mysteries of life, the mysteries of philosophy, the beautiful qualities of literature and art, and other bold and unrestrained words. Youth swelled up with heat in our blood, and this heat spewed out light from everyone's mouth. The outer sea lake responded to our roar, and the sea breeze stirred up our desires. A sleepless night was buried in the edge of the conversation: the night continued to grow, and the conversation became sharper and sharper. Time was gradually consumed moment by moment? And the elegance and leisure of the night were dissolved in the blood of young people, and expressed from the froth of the mouth.</p>
<p>Time slipped to middle age, but was driven in the tropical night. Walking with friends in the coconut grove; love was attracted by the magnet of the equator, and a torrent of words slipped out of the corners of the mouth. The tall trees induced the mystery of the inner secretion of life, and the conversation between the two became as sweet as if they were fused together. We walked until midnight, and we forgot what we had said. A kind of hazy and lovely words kept pouring out of the corners of our mouths like a stream of water. We only felt it was lovely, felt it was sweetly strange and tasted good, but we didn't know what it was saying. These words were so close to us.</p>
<p>Thrown into the city of Shanghai by life, the sins of the world have been exposed in our hearts, and all the former hobbies have been changed completely. Often, we sighed at the impermanence of human affairs, the darkness of society, and our grief and depression. The vigorous conversation was completely consumed, but there was still a spark of rekindling for the future. Therefore, although the conversation was not sharp, it retained a dim color in the gray. All hopes, love, these big topics have been over in our conversations anyway, but the conversation of middle-aged people will deeply insert into the black veil of the night and consume the long night.</p>
<p>Now, not only has childhood become a thing of the past, but also the friends of youth are scattered east and west. All the objects of conversation have disappeared one by one before our eyes, and all the topics that provoke conversation are gradually dying. Life has become a lonely shadow in the black night before our eyes, and the soul is gradually becoming hollow. In front of my eyes, a small candlelight shines on my lonely shadow, and the black veil of the night is covering my heart. The object of the conversation has disappeared, and the night is swaying in the illusionary, frustrated, and lonely shadow. The memories of the beautiful conversation in the past envelop the soul even more lonely and gray, making people feel exceptionally disappointed.</p>

<h3 id="e192">Pawn <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Jian</p>
<p>(One of the Essays on Local Customs)</p>
<p>When I was a child, when adults took me to the street, I saw the only one or two pawnshops on the street. Facing the tall, large white walls with the terribly large "pawn" character, I had the same feeling as the "authentic medicinal materials" outside the pharmacy, the "official sauce" at the entrance of the sauce garden, and the "Namo Amitabha Buddha" on both sides of the temple - all around were terribly large black characters, who knew what they were doing inside? The difference was that the pawnshop was equipped with a counter that was higher than all the shops. For a child, it was simply a high wall! But what exactly was inside this high wall? No one knew clearly. Maybe it was mysterious and not something a child could know? But because of this, I felt a mystery about the large "pawn" character that made people's hats fall off when they looked at the top, and the counter that was more than twice as tall as my entire small body. I also felt an interest that was only suitable for reckoning in the heart of a child.</p>
<p>When I grew up a little and recognized two or three hundred characters, I eagerly followed the adults to the strange character that made people afraid, suspicious, but also made them feel interesting. So I also learned the crisp sound of "dang dang". But when I tried to explore the things inside this high counter, people just said that one sentence: "Children don't understand."</p>
<p>It's true that I didn't understand it. Every time I went to the street, I always sneaked a glance at the high counter, watching two or three people, empty-handed or carrying a package, with an indescribable look of embarrassment on their faces. Was it restraint and stagnation, or enthusiasm and worry? In short, those people, coming in and out, all had faces that didn't seem to be proud or happy. This was not wrong at all, but it was so incomprehensible and difficult to understand.</p>
<p>Now I have grown up completely. I have lost my childhood that will never return. I no longer have a child's heart, and no one will use the words "Children don't understand!" to spit and boast at me. When my torso grew from half the height of the high counter to the same height as the high counter, I fully understood the meaning of the strange large character, understood the tragedy inside this high counter, and lived as if I was rolling on a bed of nails. On days when some difficult encounters pushed people to the point of exhaustion, I also followed the others, standing in front of the high counter with a trembling and humble heart, and became an unfamiliar visitor in the shop marked with the large "pawn" character.</p>
<p>Living in a small city, so uncertain, empty and lonely, for lonely travelers in life, this strange and unpleasant "pawn" shop is just like a small inn in a desolate mountain. Seeing it on a desolate path at dusk, it may still be worth rejoicing (!); so, when there is a shortage of food for the family tomorrow, and acquaintances are so practical that they are preparing cold and crying expressions waiting for you, you can only remember the cold and frightening large character, and quietly pick out something, maybe take off the clothes you are wearing, maybe drop a small finger ring that is not worth much but is worn as a permanent souvenir. With an eager and humble mood, I hide and quietly stand under the high counter, waiting for the agreement of the pawnbroker and the payment of a little money. In this way, I tremblingly overcome another difficulty.</p>
<p>Now, I have learned the meaning of the word "pawn" from life, and it has turned from curiosity to fear for me, from comedy to tragedy. I would rather someone still say to me: "Children don't understand this kind of thing!"</p>
<p>However, I am no longer a child!</p>
<h3 id="e193">Pottery Kiln <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Ruizhi</p>
<p>In early summer in the South, the weather is already very hot. Early in the morning, the huge sun slipped out from behind the mountains in the east, and the earth was filled with heat. The breeze that blew across my face felt as if it was spewing out of a fire pit, scorching hot. The withered yellow rice seedlings in the fields, the dwarf trees on the hillsides, the chimneys on the farmhouses, all the scenery seemed lifeless without a trace of vitality. The pottery kilns spread out under the hillsides also seemed to be old and quietly lying in the morning sun. The road leading to the town, where there used to be a constant stream of people walking from morning to night, now doesn't even have the shadow of a stray dog.</p>
<p>Old Long, who had worked in the kiln firing porcelain since he was a child, was as thin as a beaten wild dog, his bones seemed to be exposed outside his skin, and his eyes were yellow and without a trace of light. Although he was only in his forties, his face was full of wrinkles, as if he were very old. At this time, he was walking in the fields, constantly looking at the sun in the sky, and then at the porcelain kiln without a trace of fire.</p>
<p>"It's been a full three months. If this goes on, there won't be any more bowls to be fired in the kiln. I've been eating this bowl of porcelain rice since I was a child, but I've never seen anything like this year when there hasn't been a fire for three months!" As he thought, his feet involuntarily walked towards the porcelain kiln. This was the way he was every day.</p>
<p>In the kiln that hadn't been fired for three months, there was a layer of clay everywhere, and the kiln holes were already covered with cobwebs. But the bowls pushed aside were stacked high, basket by basket. In the past, there had never been so many stored here. As soon as they were made, they were bought by the bowl dealers in the town, but now, they were like waste, piled up from three months ago to the present, and never moved. Old Long looked at the situation that he had seen countless times in the past three months, and his heart seemed to be numb without any emotion, just shaking his head and walking away quietly.</p>
<p>It was afternoon. On the road to the town, it was as lively as it used to be, with hundreds of men and women carrying hundreds of loads of bowls towards the town. Old Long and his son also each carried four loads of bowls, mixed in the crowd. But this image was clearly different from the past. In the past, it was this lively every day, and the road was never cut off from human traces. Although the people walking were all sweating and panting under the weight on their shoulders, they walked very energetically. The quarrels and laughter of women and men echoed everywhere. But today, although there were hundreds of people, they were all silent. There was no laughter at all, only low sighs and heavy breathing. Everyone's face was pale yellow. Each face, like a hungry dog, was terribly thin and dark. The pace of walking was so slow, and the sweat flowed across the dusty face, drawing black traces.</p>
<p>The river water was reddish, and the sun shone on it, making it even brighter. At this time, the cargo ships carrying bowls, which were parked on the shore, were lying in silence. The cabins were empty, without a basket of goods. This was just like the hundreds of people carrying bowls to the porcelain shops in the town. They were refused to buy by the shops. A group of people had no choice but to sit quietly by the river. They looked at the cargo ships that used to constantly transport goods out but were now empty, and their own hundreds of loads of unsold bowls. Hundreds of faces, hundreds of pairs of pale yellow eyes, just kept looking at each other.</p>

<h3 id="e195">Global Harmonica Association Regular Broadcast <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Our country's harmonica expert Mr. Bao Mingshan has recently united with various famous harmonica players from within the country, including Yu Yu, Zhao Lianbi, Zheng Hongmo, and Zhang Qiguang, to form a Global Harmonica Research Association on the second floor of 503 North Sichuan Road. Since the Association announced in various newspapers last week that it was seeking members free of charge, the number of applicants has been very enthusiastic. There are still a few vacancies in each class. Those who aspire to learn and research harmonica music should not miss this opportunity. The members' study and research time has also been decided: the elementary class will meet every Saturday from 8:00 PM to 9:00 PM, and the research class will meet every Sunday from 8:00 PM to 9:00 PM. In order to enable members to practice and perform, the Association has decided to start next week and practice broadcasting on the Ye Mei Radio Station every Sunday from 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Letter <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor,</p>
<p>Greetings. I recently read a letter in your newspaper on June 7th, stating that our society included Wang Tantantan and Wang Xiaodan in our program without their permission. This is not true. On the 29th of last month, the two ladies, along with Ms. Bao Xuexue and others, personally visited the Fuxing Radio Station to make guest appearances and expressed their desire to join our society. Due to the late hour, they did not fill out the application form, but both parties had agreed at the time. Therefore, our program should rightfully list them as singers for our society. However, Wang et al. did not come to the station to broadcast on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd. Our society considered that the two had gone back on their word. Later, we learned that although Wang et al. liked to sing, they did not have the consent of their parents and could not fulfill their wishes to broadcast for our society. Therefore, our society, with understanding, did not question them. Who knew that Wang Jun Xiaolin would publish this news in your newspaper, which is extremely laughable. This matter concerns the reputation of our society, and we fear that the outside world will not understand the truth. Therefore, we hereby issue a solemn statement and ask you to publish it in a corner of your newspaper. We would be most grateful. Our society has already officially communicated with Wang Jun Xiaolin in a separate letter.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>

<p>The Shanghai Sound Film Company's substitute filming of "Little Aunt" has been completed, so the progress of "Peach Blossom Dream" is very rapid. Director Dan Duyu has not slept for several nights, but handles affairs as usual during the day. His spirit is truly amazing.</p>
<p>Miss Lei Mengna visited the Shanghai film studio and took several photos of the set of "Peach Blossom Dream." It is said that Lei may join "Peach Blossom Dream" to play a role.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Chong of Nanjing visited the Shanghai film studio and praised the interior scene of Peach Blossom Creek built for "Peach Blossom Dream" endlessly.</p>
<p>Gao Mangsheng has always been known as a fool, but his performance in "Peach Blossom Dream" is exceptionally profound and is the only promising talent in the film industry.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Second Performance of the Ant Troupe <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Performing at the Lake Society on the 16th of this month</p>
<p>Since the Ant Troupe's first performance of "Jinbao" was a success, it has been actively preparing for its second performance. After months of effort, it has been officially scheduled to perform at the Beijing Road Lake Society on the 16th of this month. The troupe was founded by the famous cultural group Ant Society and has strong strength. In addition to the first show being offered free of charge to its more than 800 members, there will be two more shows at 2:00 PM and 8:00 PM in the afternoon. The scripts are "At Parting" by the British female poet "Mansfield" translated by Luo Jialun, President of Central University, "Chastity" by Japanese Kikuchi Kan, and "Two Friends in Distress" created by the troupe members themselves. All of them are works with profound meaning and moving plots. It is said that ticket sales have already begun, and major stores and bookstores on Nanjing Road and Simalu are selling them on consignment. It is expected that this performance by the troupe will once again cause a sensation.</p>
<h3 id="e199">The Release Period of "Hysteria" <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>The sound film "Hysteria" directed by Yueming, because it is a maiden work, and because everything has been newly planned, such as the sound studio, production equipment, and the additions and changes to the story, are all matters that consume a lot of energy and resources. Furthermore, because the initial setting of the "Hysteria" story is Sichuan, Ren Pengnian and his party also delayed for a considerable amount of time in Sichuan (of course, the filming of newsreels also took up a part of this time). It took several months to come back to shoot the interior scenes. From the beginning to the end, it took a full year. It can be seen that Yueming's own ability is not small, as she only shot one film in a year. Now, everything about "Hysteria" has been completed for a long time, so the reason for the delay in its release is actually because the films already scheduled by Jincheng are too crowded. Now this is a true and reliable message. After "Beginning of Man," it will be "Hysteria's" release period. Movie fans who have been waiting anxiously can find compensation in this amazing debut work.</p>
<h3 id="e200">"Goddess of Liberty" Discovers New Child Star Ren Ke <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>There is indeed a shortage of actors on the screen, and there is even a greater shortage of child roles. The child stars in "Goddess of Liberty" directed by Situ Huimin originally included Cai Weining and Cai Weixian, who are the two older ones. The play also needs a younger character to play the childish era of this children's drama character. After much searching, a brand new child star - Ren Ke - was discovered. He is only three years old, understands Mandarin and Shanghai dialect, can speak Cantonese, and can also act. Rather than saying that this is his innate inheritance, it is better to say that his acquired comprehension has helped his acting development. On the set, under the director's instructions, and with the praise of many viewers, he performed a variety of poses. Once, Shi Chao, who played his father, came back, and he knew to salute him and waved to him happily. But he doesn't understand that this is acting. The plot in the play has already achieved such reasonable results, it is no wonder that the actors from the Central Film Studio who came to Datong to visit praised him repeatedly.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Lianhua Express News <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>The Lianhua Northern Sound Machine is the latest invention. Its sound symbols are not wave-shaped, nor serrated, nor horizontal stripes. They are connected to each other little by little, looking like a string of candied haws.</p>
<p>The actors like to listen to Ma Xuweibang talk about the plot the most, because his speech has a well-modulated rhythm, allowing the listeners to have illusions in their eyes.</p>
<p>Lianhua actors Jin Yan and Shang Guanwu have recently been borrowed by other companies. Lao Jin stars in "Peach Blossom Fan" for Xinhua, and Lao Shang stars in "Hero of the Times" for Yihua.</p>
<p>Liu Jiqun has recently been seen carrying a cane, which is said to be the one given to him by his wife after she was cured of her disease.</p>
<p>Lianhua has discovered another newcomer, Huang Dai. This gentleman is currently working in the production department, but he will soon appear in several new films. It is expected that his villain style will achieve unprecedented success.</p>
<p>The songs in "Autumn Fan Lamp," "You Are My Lifeline," both the music and lyrics are from the hands of musicians and celebrities in the literary and art world, harmonious and beautiful, and unprecedented. After being released, they are recited by every household, as expected.</p>
