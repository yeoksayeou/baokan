<h3>鐵道部整理路債之成績</h3>
<p>— 彥</p>
<p>我國政府鑒於開闢交通之念不容緩。近年於鐵路之整理與建設。亟亟進行。然而鐵路之建築查金。就已往經騐。都向國外募集。以現狀而言。此種需要。殆尤甚於往昔。是外資之如何取得。當爲鐵路建設問題之焦點。顧外資之動向。雖以各該國資本輸出能力爲轉移。但本身信用之厚薄。則尤佔重要。我國對外信用。年來因政治已見安定。外價雖未有大規模之整理計劃。然其價格已一致向上。而鐵路債務。尤以軍人提用路欵之舊習早已革除。各路可稍用餘力。以整理債務。是以市價騰漲。更見迅速。就去年而論各鐵路之償債能力如左。</p>
<p>（一）北寗滬杭甬膠濟等三路債券。均能依照合同規定。償還本息。</p>
<p>（二）京滬汴洛兩路債券。前年僅付利息一次。去年則依照合同。均付息兩次。</p>
<p>（三）津浦路原續兩項借欵。前年本息均未償付。去年則原借欵及續借欵之德發部份。均付息一次。</p>
<p>（四）道淸路之贖路債券及購車借欵。先後撥還利息或本息一部份。</p>
<p>除上述各項外。各路之外商料債。如平漢津浦平綏等路。均已規定按月提還若干。京滬路之購車塾欵。其每月償付數目。亦自英金四千五百鎊遞增至一萬二千五百鎊。而量近消息。則本息愆期已久之南潯路日金借欵。與前郵傳部正金銀行借欵。據外電所傳。亦有分別整理之說凡此種種。鐵道部維持債信之苦心。可以想見矣。</p>
<p>以言內債。則鐵道部經管之各項舊欠內債。約共三千萬元。其中除滬杭甬路範圍以內之蘇路浙路兩項瞪券。及浙路公債等三種。共計本息約一百六十萬元。聞將按現負數對折收回。其餘如川路湘路鄂路等證券。雖經持票人再三籲請。迄今猶未聞有何具體辦法。其近年發行老。津浦路購車公債之本金償還。則曾一再展期。收回粵漢路商股公債之抽籤還本。至今亦無消息。乃者鐵道部於國內幹路之興修。計劃不遺餘力。其需要之經費。亦不在少數。回憶粵漢路滬杭甬路以及浙贛路之完成。均得國內金融界之恊助。卽最近江南鐵路公司京韶路之建設。亦賴國內資本。足見鐵道興修計劃之實現。其有賴國民之熱忱擁護。亦非淺鮮。然國民投資之取得。必以國內債信提高爲條件。殆可斷言。所幸鐵路內債。數量未見甚巨。以鐵道財政之現狀。與鐵道部整理外債之成績而言。再進行整理內債。以提高其信用。當亦非難事也。</p>
<h3>法外長聘問俄波　歐洲和平關鍵　昨赴華沙途次柏林　受德政府正式歡迎</h3>
<p>此行旨在鞏固法波舊日同盟　畢蘇資基因病不克參與談話</p>
<p>（巴黎）外交部長賴伐爾、業於午後七時啟程、前往華沙及莫斯科、聘問波俄兩國政府、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）後數日內法外長賴伐爾將在莫斯科與華沙討論與歐洲和平極有關係之問題、賴氏已於今晚離此、先赴波京、次赴俄京、當時送行奢頗衆、衆視賴氏之赴波京、較赴俄京尤爲重要、因今須消釋因波德條約及法俄互助條約所引起兩國間之誤會也、賴氏抵莫斯科後、將設法使法波兩國間之友交由冷轉熱、聞波蘭狄克推多畢蘇資基上將現患病甚重、故不能與賴氏談話云、（九日路透電）</p>
<p>（柏林）法外長賴伐爾所乘之車、今晨過此赴華沙、法國大使龐賽赴站迎候、並送至富郎克福始止、途中告以最近之消息、蘇俄大使蘇列芝則侯之於西爾興車站、火車在此停留二十一分鐘、俄大使登車代表蘇俄政府問候、賴氏旋復行至月臺、接受德政府之正式歡迎、賴氏精神煥發、談論風生、法國代表團其他人員則與法報駐德訪員交談、（十日國民電）</p>
<p>華沙　法外長賴伐爾將於下午五時五十分乘車抵此、此間籌備歡迎不遺餘力、外長貝克將赴站迎迓、但隨賴氏俱來之伕報訪員外、不准他人入站、車站已由警察驅散閒人、祇准波蘭外部認可之少數波蘭訪員得入月臺、此後卽不允接見新聞記者、以免賴氏此行之結果洩漏於外、此行關鍵在於星期六之讌會、屆時總統莫錫基亦將出席云、（十日國民電）</p>
<p>華沙　官塲發表正式公報、謂軍政部長畢蘇資基上將體氣不佳、醫師叮囑切勿操勞、故預定與法國外長賴伐爾會晤之議、只得作罷云云、據私人方面消息、畢氏最近患尿毒症甚重、雖得脫險、究因年高、體氣衰弱、仍足使人憂盧云、按畢氏今年已六十七歲、（九日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>華沙　法國前外長巴爾都、現外長賴伐爾、前後一年中來聘波蘭者兩次、具見法國對於東歐同盟國關切之深、波國輿論皆以此爲言、多數人士以法波兩國同盟、今後將益趨鞏固、引以爲幸、波蘭人土重視賴伐爾來聘一舉、於此叮見、惟政府方面、因伕俄兩國甫經訂立互助公約、故不無採取保留態度、蓋伕國在東歐友邦之中、究礙置波蘭於何等地位、係政府人士所亟欲了然者也、此外外交界人士、惟恐賴伐爾來聘、引起東歐公約談判之重啓、亦感不安、總之賴伐爾在波蘭勾留之期、過於短促、對於伕波兩國間全部問題、勢難作澈底之研究、惟近來引起兩國誤會之若干點、則有澄淸之望、吾人所當注意者、即伕波兩國盟約有加以維持、並充實之必要、此則波蘭一切人士所同意承認者也、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）外長賴伐爾於訪俄之前、先在華沙逗留、與波蘭當局會晤、各報對此俱極重視、幷以爲法波同盟條約依然存在、實與法俄互助公約不相抵觸、新時代報載稱、「波蘭政府聲言願與法國加重聯繫、吾人自歡迎之、此種辦法旣與吾人所已簽訂之公約不相抵觸、亦與吾人行將簽訂之公約能相融洽、而保障和平之道亦卽在此」、斐迦羅報謂、「去年一月二十六日德波兩國簽訂十年互不侵犯條約、旣未妨害法波同盟、則今茲伕俄互助公約、自與法波同盟無所窒碍、互助公約乃應付現實所必須、法波同盟則爲兩國傳統友誼之結果」云、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）時報載一與賴伐爾外長華沙之行有關之社論稱、歐洲自知當前之危機、復羣起擁護法國之主張、並已締結一相當限度之協定、規定預防此種患難之最有效方伕、蘇俄自與伕國締結互援公約後、今亦躋於維持歐洲現狀國家之林、法國之防禦系統未必能裁减軍備、或緩和緊張之政局、但德國旣不信任鄰邦之和平志願、則此種防禦政策實屬要圖云、（十日國民電）</p>

<p>陝西地處西陲、敎育不甚發達、重以荒歉之餘、農村經濟破產、災情較重之各縣敎育、過去規模、大多蕩然無存、今幸年荒已轉、交通漸見發達、雖敎育經費、僅足以維持現狀、但當局對目前需要之輕而易舉者、蓋亦無不計劃實施之、</p>
<p>全省中等敎育、省立中學、計有西安高中、西安一中、西安二中、三原中學、三原女中、鳳翔中學、南鄭中學、安康中學榆林中學、共九校、各縣聯立者、有南鄭共立中學、商縣共立中學兩校、縣立者有郃陽、韓城、雒南、西鄉、南鄭、等初中計五校、私立者有西安之民興、民立、玫瑰女子、尊德女子、華縣之咸林富平之立誠共計初中六校、敎廳以各校學生、多屬農家子弟、本極淸寒、爲實現敎育機會均等之原則、曾於廿二年度開始之時、豁免省立中小學學生學雜費幷獎助淸寒學生、此事殊爲難得、</p>
<p>師範敎育、省立有西安師範、西安女師、大荔師範、南鄭師範、南鄭女師、安康師範、榆林女師、等七校、多與中學合設、利少弊多、而師範與中學之分佈狀况、且多麕集於省會或政治中心所在地、殊少平均發展、各縣小學師資、甚感缺乏、爰於去年在西安設立小學敎師訓練所、調各縣現任小學敎師來省受訓、六月爲一期、畢業仍回原職服務、於各縣敎育之改淮上、收效甚著、此外縣立師範講習所、現有十二三校、甚少顯著之成績、敎廳對於師範敎育改進之辦法、已見諸實施者、則爲實行師範獨立制劃分全省爲八師範區等、</p>
<p>職業敎育、省立職業學校、原有西安農業、三原工業職業初級中學等二校、縣立者有南鄭之蠶科、潼關之農業等二校、聯立者有榆林之毛革工業職業學校、私立者有西安之女子平民　業學校、共計六處、敎廳鑒於陝西形勢、天然可分爲三大部、陝北榆林屬、富於毛產、延屬宜於墾牧關、中適於農林工業、漢中則蠶桑農林採礦均宜、惟皆有改良之必要、除已將榆林之毛革工業職業學校、收爲省辦、由省庫撥費、充實內容、並就停辦之華陰兵工廠、籌設華陰工科職業學校外、尙擬按各職業敎育區、逐年開設適應環境之各種職業學校、期於最短期內、達到每區至少有職校一二處之標準、</p>
<p>初級敎育、各地均不發達、失學兒童、爲數至夥、刻年荒已轉、當力謀義務敎育之擴充、現正從事各縣敎育經費及學齡兒童等項調查、以便統盤計劃、完成全省義務敎育、關於社會敎育、除西安有省立第一圖書館、省立第一民衆敎育館、臨潼華淸池有省立第二民衆敎育館外、今尙籌設一西京文化博物院、內部擬分古物科學二館、一方徵存古物、考古代文化之源、一方研究科學、赴近代文明之路、將來籌備就緒、正式開辦、對於西北文化之進展、裨益實大、</p>
<p>陝西敎育方鍼、據敎廳編輯主任祁伯文氏所談、計分兩大綱、一爲民族敎育、一爲生產敎育、民族敎育實施之注意、則爲（一）鄉十敎育、（二）健康敎育、至生產敎育方面、則注意（一）職業敎育、（二）農村敎育、鄉土、健康、職業、農村·等敎育、均各分祖委員會、以便專門研究、負責推進、祁氏尙研究鄉十敎育、爲述鄉土敎育意義之重要、略爲（一）啟發兒童愛鄉之觀念、養成了解本鄉之能力俾樂爲鄉十服務、（二）由鄕土信念、養成民族自信、引起民族竟識、振發民族精神、由樂鄉愛鄉進而爲保衛鄕土、（三）發展鄉土生產及工業、兼謀鄕土事業之改進、由保衛鄉士更進而建設鄕土云、</p>
<p>陝西尙無高等敎育、有主張應辦大學者、但經費設備及師資、在在均成問題、目前補救辦伕、確應實事求是、多選派學生分入國內外大學、予以官費、培養高等敎育方面需要之人材、同時並添設農林工業等專科學校、以造就生產實際人材、中央擬在武功創辦一國立農林專科學校、此事在環境上、旣極需要、旦在實際上又甚有效力、甚望其早日實現也、</p>
<p>每地報紙出版物、發達與否、恒與地方文化敎育、互有連鎖之密切關係、西安報紙、有西京日報、西北文化日報、工商日報、朝報、國民日報、曉報數種、此外尙有敎育會敎育廳及其他各機關出版物多種、各縣則絕少見者、日報銷數、以西京日報爲最多、然亦僅達五千份、其原因、蓋多限於客觀條件也、前陝省舉行第一屆運動會、該報所出特刊之軟性記載中、有「標準美人」字樣、稱讚女子跳高冠軍某女士之健美、並有「黃將軍搖頭擺尾、加入田徑賽」等詞、更以游戲筆調、述一溜入跑道之黃犬、不料竟惹起一部份社會人士之反感、尤其某局長以爲「黃將軍」係影射彼本人、頗爲不滿、當時滿城風雨、事態似頗嚴重、後經解釋、雖告無事、然該地一般社會知識之水準應當提高、以及今後普敎工作之應當努力、硯此一類趣事之發生、自更暸然、無待煩言矣</p>

<p>安東通訊、自偽組織財政當局廢止銀元與鎭平銀以來、市面之流通貨幣、以偽紙幣爲唯一本位其他如中國鑄造之現洋、與日本銀行·朝鮮銀行·所發行之金票、均可流通於市面故偽組織貨幣甚畸形、但現大洋爲銀質實貨、偽幣乃虛本位紙幣、難得商民信用、近來現大洋兌換率暴漲·各埠匯水亦大爲增高、查四月二十八日、現洋每千元之行市、電匯上海、偽幣須一千三　　　元、烟台須一千三百十元、天津須一十三百十四元、此以前匯水各漲三十乃至四十元、市况之增高、誠予市商以一大打擊、且有損失鉅金者、至二十九日電匯上海　爲一千三百十八元、票匯煙台爲一千三百十四元、票匯天津爲一千三百十四元五角、匯水按日高漲、異常堅挺、偽安東當局、擬出偽令强制干涉、</p>
<p>開原通訊、開原偽縣政府、鑒於現洋奇漲、紙幣毛荒、無有已時、市民惶惶、莫不呌苦述天、一面將情形報吿偽財政當局、一面卽亂作主張、强制商民規定市價、並遍貼布吿、以後商民如再提高價格或故爲騰漲奢、定按擾亂金融治罪、絕不寬貸云云、由此可洞悉偽組織各地民間困苦情形之一斑矣、（東北社）</p>

<p>— （朱紫）</p>
<p>在宜　的東門外，有一灣流水繞着，中間聳起一所　圯的亭閣，據說這就是「牧之水榭一；按牧之是晚唐詩人，因慕宜興多佳山水，所以就築水榭以居，直到現在千百年來，還能使後人俯仰遺蹟，誠不禁感慨係之了！</p>
<p>這裏，沒有美妙的點綴，華麗的佈置；也沒有名人的書畫，足供後人的賞鑑，只有頹瓦幾片，殘垣半壁；還有那蛛絲　着的破洞；而樑上的一塊橫匾，字跡也看不出了，以前此地曾聚過不少文人，都算抱着懷古的心情，到這兒來憑弔，一方面可以避暑，飲淸茶，迎凉風，對素月，現在久不加以修葺，弄得這樣荒凉，而後生小子也許會把它忘却的。</p>

<h3>兩幅山水畫</h3>
<p>— 一葉</p>
<p>在藝術的評價上，儘管是很小的畫幅一只要畫面上的藝術成分豐富，那麼這幅畫便居上乘，反之，就縱橫到數十丈的巨構，若缺乏藝術的意味，也認為卑劣的作品。現在且把美學上的估量方法，運用到地方名勝方面來，覺得沒有什麽地方不對。</p>
<p>這見解的發現，在我是頗偶然的，就在這次春假旅行的時期，我看過不少的名勝，然只有南京的白鷺洲和揚州的瘦西湖這兩處很有上面認定的藝術條件。</p>
<p>首先，讓我來展開白鷺洲的畫幅：</p>
<p>一片點綴着少許苔蘚的冷水，疏疏落落地浸着幾條靑草，池塘的邊緣開着縱一叢，橫一叢的菜花，遠處幾座矮小的田舍散佈在平蕪柳堤間，當脈脈地斜暉倒映着半段古城的影子，在橋頭，池邊，三兩個穿着春衫的處女或少婦，輕輕地敲着砰杵，從此若斷若續的音節中，回望着洲前綠楊掩映着頹敗的亭館，殘缺荒凉的情狀，不禁悵然若失，徘徊流連，不忍遽去—</p>
<p>至於瘦西湖的豐韻，杜牧之的「娉娉嬝娘十三餘」那句詩形容得恰好，眞的，把瘦西湖來比女人，尤其是玲瓏活潑的小姑娘最美妙不過。女性的美是在於活動而優美的曲線。而瘦西湖本身就特別地富有這種曲線。當你一出天寗門，在問月橋或綠楊村那兒，坐上一葉扁舟，在這瘦小的湖面上慢慢地划去，曲曲折折，灣灣轉轉，幾度迴環在春波柳蔭間，這樣的過了虹橋，小金山，直到平山堂，湖面的曲折越見美妙，這裏含有不盡的深長意味，和細膩纏綿的情趣，到微波峽時，眞使你發痴的會想到女性的細腰上去，線的韻律的美，和人體畫室內的模特兒。同樣的使你手顫心慄呢！沿岸的風物也複雜有致，古舊的城墻，近水的樓臺，玲瓏的橋梁，明媚的湖村，還有處處敷抹着一種粉綠的色調，這便楊柳都城的揚州所特具的背景了。</p>
<h3>騎馬上虎邱</h3>
<p>— 吳雅非</p>
<p>乘了五點鐘的早車趕到了蘇州，因為離開搭木瀆班輪船的時間還早，所以我和雄便想往虎邱一遊；準備回來乘第三班輪船的。雄聽說到虎邱去，他也很高興，然而為歡喜騎馬的緣故，於是就向宋記馬房裏租得了兩匹白馬，兩個人騎着緩緩地向虎邱進行。</p>
<p>和煦的春陽照着大地，輕風掠過脖子，帶來了一股醉人的淸香；把我們窒息了好久的胸襟也衝了開來。我們嘴裏哼着春天的戀歌，週圍是那麼怙靜，；田野裏一片靑的麥和一片黃的菜花，接連地向眼前飛過，朗朗的歌聲和得得的馬蹄聲相應和。沿着一條碎石舖成的大路走去……</p>
<p>朝左首右首抹了幾個灣，一座三吳古剎的西園叢林已在前面：當時雄要到西園去觀五色大魚，於是我們就在寺前下了馬，闖進了寺裏，在山門內發現一輛流綫型的新式汽車，那準是從上海來的「闊老寄放在這裏的。寺裏是這樣靜穆的，除了不多幾個沙彌在來往走動之外，差不多沉寂的像死了一樣。我們在一扇門裏挨身進去，那是一個簡陋的園子，祗見森木葱籠，一泓靜止的碧水澄淸得可以見底。踱出了山門，望左走了幾步，到了一個小小的園林中，「放生池」裏正有許多尾所謂五色大魚在唼喋着萍草，雄把帶來的餅干投入池中，魚兒羣來爭食，不多時五塊餅干都給吞噬完了。</p>
<p>玩了許久，看看腕上的手表，知道時間已經不早，連忙催雄一同跨上了馬背，把手中的繮繩一緊，那馬便騰起了四蹄向前路奔馳。</p>
<p>虎邱的寺，虎邱的塔，都在眼前很淸晰地出現了；然而當走到山坡下的當兒，那馬不知怎的向前一蹶，使我在馬上坐立不穩，冷不防恰從馬背上摔了下來。我猛的用手去撐，手掌中已擦去了一大塊皮膚，膝蓋也已跌破，鮮紅的血汨汨地從創口中流出，流出。因為疼痛，故已無心再玩；「雖已到了虎邱，可是虎邱終於玩不成了」！雄說著嘆了一口氣。</p>
<p>兩個人棄了馬，改雇了兩輛人力車，回到了胥門，媚給我洗著血迹，裹著創口說：</p>
<p>「誰敎你們放著馬車不坐，要去騎馬擺威風呢」！</p>
<h3>武陵古洞</h3>
<p>— （朱紫）</p>
<p>武陵洞在宜興嗡目山中，地處荒僻，人迹罕到，其實是名勝的所在，就可惜沒有知音去賞鑑呢。在春初，我們去玩，那裏有柔軟的草，馥郁的花，以及參天的古木；如果在秋天，那麽還有干山的紅業，點綴出更美的景色。</p>
<p>洞門是狹小的，古籐掛在四壁，一路上怪石嶙嶙，各個的表現其不同的姿態。山澗水從地底流過，汨汨有聲，再進去便比外面寬敞，可以望見天日，陽光輕拂着遊人的臉，感到十分舒暢。</p>
<p>走得越深越是黑暗，總不能達到終點，那邊雲氣也太濃，閒或有水滴落下來。據說有人冒險一直走進去，可以到達安徽省的地界，可是這也不能確定。這個洞倘能加以一番修飾，將來一定是很可觀的。</p>
<h3>右軍舊游地</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>離開了死一般的城市，天空中稀疏的晨星，還發出伊的最後的微弱的光芒。</p>
<p>再沉寂是沒有了！這微寒的春曉：兩樣似的細霧，又不絕地向我們的身子侵襲，但！咱們的遊興，倒反因此濃了起來！</p>
<p>當我們感覺到腿已酸疲的時候，驀然地，給我們瞧見了，山麓裏孤聳着的尖尖的黑影。</p>
<p>喲！這豈不是就是那壯嚴的「仰高亭」的亭尖嗎？那一座座淡灰色的屋宇，豈不是就是晋王右軍廟嗎？</p>
<p>的確，右軍的舊游地——獨秀山，確已到了！但！伊還含羞似的躱在那牛奶色似的晨霧裏，不願與我們見面。</p>
<p>近處鬱鬱蒼蒼的矮山，也彷如貪睡的懶婦，尙在做伊們的酣夢。</p>
<p>走進了築在山腰松薛叢中的刻石庵，仰首就有有夢四道人呂　」書的「右軍舊游地」橫額一方，呈現在我們的眼底！</p>
<p>庵雖這樣的樸實簡單，但那幽靜的秀麗的，深含着十七世紀的古雅風味，足使我們的心脾，舒暢了不少！</p>
<p>庵中旣多神像，多題聯：我覺得這一聯最為可愛，字跡也這聯最為堅俊瀟灑：</p>
<p>「鵝池留古蹟，喜從詩酒招遊，憶當年地屬右軍，果誰問，幾杵晨鐘，數聲暮鼓。</p>
<p>鷲嶺溯遺蹤，曾向湖山欖勝，看此際峯高獨秀，更何須，六橋風月，三竺雲烟。一</p>
<p>庵前有苔痕斑爛的石碑，碑的中央鐫着「刻石佳地」四個大字，兩旁又有幾行未柔媚的小字：「予性僻好遊，入嵊抵桃源鄕，□□□□見林　陡絕，天然圖畫，□□□□□奉化毛玉佩口□□題一，碑的背而，又有七絕一首：「崔嵬百尺翠微　，　　　衆仙、，到處□鴻留指爪，風遺應不讓前賢。□□□□邑志載刻石山一名獨秀山一名穿山□□□」歷經滄桑，安蹟多已糢糊了！</p>
<p>山頂是平廣的「王郞坪」，庵左是「紙　潭」，潭是很小的，在亂巖之下，那澄潔的淸凈的潭水，反映出蒼翠的松柏的綠蔭，正如一張不敷脂粉的少女的臉。真嗎？昔日右軍听畫的紙　，確曾飛進這兒嗎？但是！有誰目覩呢？</p>
<p>呀！右軍，你何故遺下了墨沼？又何故遺下了鵝池？徒使後人憑吊！又你最愛的遇風附輒聞樂聲的「風洞」，究在那兒呢？</p>
<h3>玄墓攬勝記</h3>
<p>— 吟秋</p>
<p>予家先塋在光福銅井山，此次因祭掃之便，得飽覽玄墓諸勝，暮春天氣，晴光澹蕩，更喜老父腰脚健强，登臨遊眺，其興益豪，是日七時出城，在棗市登輪，乘客不多，尙覺舒適，晤熟友朱劉諸人，同舟而行，足破岑寂，八時啓艇，九時半到木凟，十時過石碼頭，又半時經五峰山而達善人橋，遊穹　天池諸山者，均於此登岸，十二時已抵光福。先在旅舍小憇，果腹後，乘竹兜入山謁墓，墓道幽深，林木葱　，緬想先德，不禁有追遠之思—祭畢尙早，而遊興遂動。</p>
<p>先至柏因社，卽司徒廟，入古柏山房，由儈培根導觀「靑奇古怪」四古柏，怪者歌臥，靑者聳立，盤旋而上者為古，下合上分奢為奇。實則尙有二株，亦極夭矯蟠屈之致，其兀傲之態，不讓於四，合之為六，因淸乾隆之品題而其二弗彰。佛室曰流香閣，懸聯二：一為一淸奇古怪畫難狀，風火雷霆刧不磨」，係同治間歸安吳雲所題；一為「此中祇許鸞鳳宿，其上應有蛟螭蟠」，則為銅井山人潘遵祁所書。其旁為柏廬，中有鐵橋和尙所畫古柏，其意不宜以四字分題四柏，而使各占一字，蓋淸者未嘗不奇，奇者未嘗不古，古者亦怪，怪者亦靑，淸奇古怪，固諸柏之所同具，其說頗有見地。因成一絕云：「為尊古柏到山房，老榦奇枝擁翠蒼，我亦生來同傲骨，不知人世有冰霜」。</p>
<p>旣出，屈曲梅林中，循仄徑而上，直至玄墓山，聖恩寺前，古木參天，幽　夾道，塵襟頓釋。入內為梵天閣，有王時敏書「海印發光」額，上層即為萬佛閣，前住持忠恕所募建。其右為還　閣，即康熙駐蹕所，豁朗宏敞，彷彿焦山寺之枕江閣，鷄鳴寺之豁蒙樓，憑欄望太湖，雲影波光，氣象萬千，為寺中最勝處。壁間題墨甚多，如李根源錄鄭所南句，「雲深千古寺，月冷一天秋」：于右任之夜宿閣上句，「鐘催明月上，風送太湖來；尙有康南海題詩云：「邱壑重深夾路松，梅花百萬冷香濃，遺碑洞石晋時墓，古寺斜陽周代鐘；香海人家三十里，太湖波浪百千峯；憨山說法空空矣，但領山情與水容」。頗能寫實，茗坐久之，亦得—詩：「萬樹梅林一徑通，閒尋古寺此山中，登臨直上還元閣，雲水蒼茫映碧空」。</p>
<p>下山後，猶有餘興，遂至東崦草堂，為吾友吳似蘭別業，園林幽蓓，結構精雅，有看雲處·叢桂小榭諸勝。壁間有余舊題一聯云：「得意自忘言，精舍層樓聯遠岫；耽幽愛淸賞，波光雲影映疏林」；蓋集　也。門外柳堤，傍水面山，境尤幽絕！又成一詩：「草堂寂寂故人家，門外柳絲傍水涯，最是詩情無限好，兩三漁艇夕陽斜」。</p>
<p>翌晨，以虎山橋風景至美，而離鎭不遠，因徒步往。橋旁有虎山寺，近處即迂村，相傳雲林故居，時曉色初開，湖上羣峰，掩映入畫，漁汀樵徑，怳同隔世。續得一詩：「虎山寺畔虎山橋，曉色初開意寂寥，水碧山靑渾似畫，何年結屋伴漁樵」。旣歸，並以記之。</p>
<h3>龍華半日遊</h3>
<p>— 轉陶</p>
<p>我與龍華久違了，依稀想起了龍華塔的古舊，在前天的下午，同了幾個女伴，到龍華去流連了半日光陰。龍華古剎的面積同建築是非常雄偉的，可惜傾頹得不成樣子了。據有人考據說。龍龍華的建造，遠在孫權年間，那麽，實在可以稱是古蹟了。後來被徐文定公所焚燬，所以一直到現在，仍舊未能壯復舊觀；徐文定公雖然是天主敎的信徒，似乎也不應該把年代久遠的古廟付之一炬，無論是與他的宗旨怎樣衝突，也不必如此大煞風景，雖說是迷信的一種痕跡，可也是風景的點綴。</p>
<p>寺裏高大的佛像很多，現在有一部份方在重裝金身，有幾個佛像已經竣工了，現出了金碧輝煌的顏色，比了沒有重裝的，那是不可同日而語了，人要衣裝，佛像當然要金裝了。寺裏的和尙，正忙在募捐的工作，每一處佛殿，都有緣簿擺着，在這種民窮財盡的社會裏，這種錢倒還有人肯捐助，由此可知神權之偉大了！我們欣賞風景的，儘不妨希望他們財源滾滾而來，再過數年，說不定金黃燦爛的龍華寺，又與夕陽爭輝了。</p>
<p>我游覽了一周，看遍了幾位黨國名人親筆的匾額。可是香客旣少，游人也稀，大概龍華的香汎，巳經過了；據龍華本鄉的人說：龍華實在也無所謂香汎，與其說香汎，不如說是桃汎，因為到龍華看桃花的，多於進香的：我要想覓一些妖艷的桃顏，却眞成了「人面不紅，春風笑人」的了。</p>
<p>我記得「塔影晚鐘」是龍華八景之一，那龍華塔當然是上海的名勝了，其實龍華塔是鄉人的通稱，呌報恩塔，是什麽一回出典，恕我還沒有査考。塔高七級，望上去也不十分高，在它的衰頹陳舊看起來，高封是不少了。我聽得美術家說過：塔宜乎古，越古越是够味，所以蘇州的虎邱塔，杭州的寳叔塔，都是不可多得的風景，特列點綴品，那麽，龍華塔也可以算盡家筆下的好資料，我先在塔的最下層望了一下，只見暗沉沉的陰慘得可怕，在佛前點着微光的小燭，搖曳着好像荒野間的燐火，我那裏還有勇氣登塔，祗敢在塔下徘徜了一陣，遙睇那斜陽一抹，烏鴉歸噪，一羣羣的飛向朽塔的上層。（未完）</p>

<p>近日銀洋市况、以工商業救濟放欵尙未履行之時、銀錢業對於營業上多暫存觀望、致金融形勢反趨沉悶、而各種行情更為呆滯不動、昨市場中拆息早午仍掛一角二分、劃頭加水亦始終白劃、拆票交易、早市轉賬三百七十餘萬、新交易五十餘萬、午市無聞、小總會中交易八十餘萬、洋押欵交易取贖四十餘萬、新交做出二十餘萬、鈔票交易收回一百十餘萬、發出八十餘萬、又暗記券發出五十餘萬、各路滙欵四十餘萬、客路來源三十萬、去胃十五萬、銀行收解、外商銀行收解票欵二百五十餘萬、各種貨墊等什欵收解二百五十餘萬、電滙欺三十餘萬、特種匯欵五十餘萬、外滙結欵八十餘萬、進倉四十萬、華商銀行收解票欵二百零數萬、各種貨墊等雜欵收解二百九十餘萬、電匯欵五十餘萬、特種滙欵六十餘萬、外匯結欵九十餘萬、出倉四十萬、日商銀行收解票欵一百八十餘萬、各種貨墊等雜欵收解二百四十餘萬、特種匯欵三十餘萬、外匯結欵五十餘萬、出倉二十萬、錢莊洋公單收解三千餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解四百二十餘萬、收現二十餘萬、</p>

<h3>紗花　標紗無多大漲力</h3>
<p>紗市趨漲、市氣尚屬平靜、無積極向榮之狀、因近期有大戶交貨、市價被其阻碍、惟遜來棉市日漲、廠方成本步高、然仍難激起新買風、前市寗波和豐紗廠又向標紗市塲套賣、所以市面難於前進矣、</p>
<p>近月紗遭交貨阻碍</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、各月一致上升、但近月仍被某方有交貨轉疲、回落二·三·四角、因寗波和豐廠套出二千餘包、致檯面鬆濫、但收盤又漲、因原棉堅漲、紗市帶起、結果各月比上日均漲五·七·八·九角、午後開盤仍平、但多頭方面、繼續購進、市價仍屬未能向漲、結果各月比上午收盤價漲跌一角、査賣出裕大四百包、達記九百包、泰興五百包、潤康二千一百包、吉豐六百包、通記三百五十包、明德三百五十包、昶記九百包、長豐一千一百包、買進大孚四百包、同孚七百五十包、源大一千五百包、賡豐一千一百五十包、生源三百五十包、德記七百包、愼記八百包、潤康六百包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<p>鄭標人氣熱烈</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、各月均現大漲、形勢俏利、買方抬力較強、因邇來人氣轉機、看高者較衆、且北方棉商、每日大批收進、市價本有向漲之象、今得美棉新花漲三十餘磅音、印棉亦漲二羅比半、猶如錦上添花、北方新棉苦乾無雨、不能播種、十月期新花、買者雲集、漲風尤熾、結果各月比上日收盤價均漲三角半至四角、午後開盤稍平、拍至三收盤又回堅、結果近月比上午跌五分、收盤價遠平、惟十月期漲五分、查賣出大孚三千担、穗隆一千八百担、明德一千七百擔、合興五千三百担、昶記二千五百担、森康一千一百担、益昶一千六百担、生源五千三百担、益康一千九百担、畏和三千七百擔、同興二千擄、買進大孚四千二百擔、吉豐二千一百擔、通記一千九百擔、大豐三千五百擔、振大二千一百擔、賡豐四千二百擔、元一二千擔、長豐四千六百擔、潤康四千八百擔、源興昌一千九百擔、益昶一千九百擔、永大二千四百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>糧食　新麥年景有佳　期粉麥買氣濃厚</h3>
<p>粉昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份呈先平後則激漲之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥漲一角另、坎拿大好四分左右、當開價後、以洋麥漲度尙微、人心平平、旋則天津帮對於現粉需求、甚為迫切、對標凖購買、亦愈暢達、因此市氣步步上漲、至遠期各月份、則豫魯兩省久旱、或須影響新麥之收穫、故　外方面亦競起買進、市塲形勢遂覺步緊也、迨至下午開盤、市氣依然堅定、其時雖廠家定成澳麥兩船、價四元七角二分、一係本埠、一　內地、並同時均有套售、然以新麥年景之不佳、仍未能抑低市面也、結果本月份漲二分二釐半、六月份漲二分半、七月份漲二分、八月份漲二分二釐半、九月份漲三分、十月份漲三分半云、</p>
<p>麥昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份呈初定繼則高漲之象、當開價時、以天時熱悶、恐有雨意、至新麥年收、江南雨水尚調、當有八成左右、江北則久早之後、恐須减色、是以開價雖平、繼則逐步盤漲、遠期則新麥年景不佳之影響、人心尤俏、迨至下午開盤、各月份交易依然暢旺、市面則已呈盤旋、因洋麥傳續定二船、價祇四元七角二分、有此情形、漲度又見停頓矣、結果七月份漲八分、八月份漲七分、九月份漲一角之巨、現麥因現粉奇俏、客戶扳售、各檔均提好五分、開山東河南麥四元一角、次九分、江北麥四元零三分、次三元九角七分、宿州麥四元零八分、蚌埠麥四元零五六分、由福新去一千包、阜豐麥一千五百包云、</p>

<h3>天氣悶熱　杜米暴跌三四角</h3>
<p>洋米到多亦小　苞米亦見下游</p>
<p>本米（滬南）昨各帮來源共到三十號、（貨共六千餘石）、銷塲實以天氣悶熱、人心無意多備、故各貨做開不多、市面迭見下游、跌風甚熾、如蘇同及南港等粳價均暴跌二三角、而各晚稻更以包胃僅天津帮辦二三百包、修削尤烈、竟有四角之譜、陰變　及杜尖等各花色則以環境不良、亦步小二尺有奇、（滬北）河下各帮到船念餘號、市上各貨去胃仍淸、然客銷尙有、市形白更高料疲數分、中次償修一二角、白元亦修角外、早薄稻價小一二尺、其餘各價亦短近角、</p>
<p>洋米昨市突形趨落、良以邇日來到頭不絕、存底日增、而在最近一月內續有次西貢及碎米大絞等定成、存到旣過、來源不絕、以致囤買與客販均爲心虛求脫、內地幫連朝暢辦、未能盡數裝車、存米旣多、亦欲暫時停手、故昨日洋米成交總計一萬四千包、（路貨期貨在內）、客秈一千二百五十包、已較往日減少、而貨主亦願減價求脫、因此市價立小四五分至一角不等云、</p>
<p>苞米自各方災區辦充食糧以來、其價由二元四五角漲至四元外上週末天津苞米曾開四元一角八分、但市雖呈奇俏、然一般安慶等元路銷塲、致束手觀望、近日祇剩浙紹幫動動、故去路一旦落淡、此種花色貨易於趨跌、昨市祇開天津苞米三百包、價做三元九角、比前市跌去二角八分、</p>
<h3>絲茶　珍眉綠茶洋銷停頓</h3>

<p>本埠洋莊茶市、忽趣疲軟、名歐莊均以首批新茶、本日業巳裝出、二期噸位、尙未配置現時並不急需、因此態度頓趨淸淡、昨市遂安土莊兩路珍眉綠茶、僅協和天裕等行、略有進胃、市盤暴跌六七元至十元不等、至祁門紅茶、大帮業已到滬、惟各茶棧、因徇某洋行之請、决定下星期一、正式佈樣云、</p>
<h3>五金　黑鐵皮受銀根影響</h3>
<p>黑鐵皮為搪瓷廠、熱水瓶廠之繁銷品、在上前二月中供少需旺、市情頗佳、但標準終以定價鬆動及滙兌放長、致行情依然有外强中乾氣象、最近市上受銀根緊迫關係、兼實用之廠家均袖手不辦、而客帮亦以銷路不廣而停購、故市情節節下墜、現市一六尺每扎售價七元二三角、三六尺售七元三四角、比之先後均各小去三四角不一、惟新近到貨又旺、而走銷仍呆、市面一時不易見好、</p>

<h3>出版與文化</h3>
<p>— 葉靑</p>
<p>出版就是印行書報，——所謂出版物是。這是人人知道的。書報或出版物為人類文化的記載，有文字和印刷以後一切文化都被它記載起來。這也是人人知道的。那末出版與文化的關係不很顯然麽？</p>
<p>是的。我們要看一個社會的文化情形，從出版的書報上，可以一目了然。尤其是在今天，文化發達，印刷便利，紙張的生產容易，幾乎現在的一切乃至過去的一切，在文明國家，是全都出版成書報了。所以有甚麼文化就有甚麼書報。文化作用於出版。</p>
<p>但如果人類的思維有邏輯性是確實的，那末過去的思維就必然成為當前思維的决定者。所謂文化，是種種觀念形態，為思維的產物。卽採取廣義，把行為包括進去也一樣，因為行為是觀念的事實化。這樣，記載過去文化而出版的書報，也就成為當前思維的决定者。出版於是就加影響於未來的文化了。這裏我們不感覺得出版之作用於文化麼？</p>
<p>如果這樣，那末依照第一個法則，我們現在出版物的貧困，據舒新城先生的估計，在世界上佔第十六位，便是我們過去文化不發達的證明了。在這種情形下，我們是應該特別努力的。歷史吿訴我們，凡文化落後的民族都要被它的車輪打下去，不能生存。所以努力發達文化，是我們生存於二十世紀的條件。</p>
<p>這樣，依照第二個法則，要發達文化，就必須在出版上加以注意。希望有甚麼樣的文化，就應該看有甚麼樣的出版物。今天的書報是將來文化的種因。所以我們將來的文化，在今天的書報出版中就透露出消息來了。</p>
<p>如果這些話是實在的，我們將來的文化便很可憂慮。因為從我們對於出版的檢閱中，知道現在的出版方向是傾向於古書和兒童讀物的競爭。在兒童讀物方面，雖於提高沒有意義，於普及是很需要的。只有古書的大出特出，是一件不祥的事情。它必然要使將來的文化呈出復古的姿容。</p>
<p>我並不根本反對古書。古書是古代文化的記載，自然應該出版，以供我們了解古代文化之用。但我們的任務不在了解過去，而在創造將來。中國過去的文化，實在不及歐洲近代得秀遠。如果我們將來的文化從中國過去出發，那是落後的，必然不及歐洲的將來。我們現在要趕上他們，與他們並駕齊驅，再不可停留在後面了。因此古書是不應該大出特出的。</p>
<p>這裏，我要附帶地說一句，多出版古書自然不應該，提倡讀古書尤其不應該。對於讀經存文的主張，在出版界，文化界和敎育界，當同聲反對。那是使文化和出版都開倒車的事情。</p>
<h3>英文作家老前輩李登輝博士</h3>
<p>— 吳道存</p>
<p>談到中國英文作家的老前輩，我們立刻會想起復旦大學校長李登輝老博士。</p>
<p>李老博士今年六十三歲了，所以可以稱「老」，而且，他的辦事精神，甚至許多靑年是望塵莫及的。不論冬夏他要吃冰，每次在復且大學吃午飯（四毛錢的大菜）時要點「蛋炒飯」，當我們看見他坐在辦公桌上工作或與復旦當局討論發展學校時的那種不倦態度，我們忘記了他的「老」。</p>
<p>他不像魯意喬治是巨漢的頭放在矮人的身上，他是身材適中的。他雖然穿上舊的西裝，但是身子挺挺的而有尊嚴。他雖然三十歲才回到中國，但是現在能講很好的普通話，上海話，和他的本鄉福建話。他雖然以英文著名，但是他的法文，德文，西班牙文，意大利文，希臘文，拉丁文，馬來文都很不錯。他常歡喜在無綫電中聽法德文的歌曲。他望着令人敬長，但是和他談起話來你又覺得他可愛。他的慈祥面龐使人對他生良好而深刻的印像。</p>
<p>他很可以做大官，但是二三十年來他一心一意辦復旦大學，這在一般人的眼光中看來也許是「其愚不可及也」，而我們中國正是需要這種「憑人」呵。他致力的慈善事業也很多，不幸的人們—如貧兒孤兒之類—受他的恩惠不少。論起他的精神收穫，他無疑的是一個很大的Nlillionaire。他是一個忠實的基督徒。</p>
<p>他有時很幽默的；當他的辦公桌上放了一大堆的信件時，他見到會說「這裏成了一個郵局」。有人問他對於毛女士嫁給老人的意見，他說「我沒有意見，因為我自己也是老人了。」他有時似乎有點傷感，最近寫給他的一位耶魯大學同班友人的信中說：「近幾個月來我常收到同班死的消息。我們從三百個年靑力强的人，减到不及半數了。我們要把我們的地位讓給我們的晚輩了」。但是他對於人生興趣還是很濃厚，他歡喜花木，復旦大學的一花一木都是由他的指示而種植的。他最近還預備造座新房子自己住，一座樸素無華的小屋。</p>
<p>他對於國事也很擔憂的。他說「每個人出十塊錢買飛機，國家的武　不是可以充實了嗎」？他主張道德救國。</p>
<p>他的英文著作很多。因他做過中華書局的英文總編輯，所以在中華出版過幾本英文敎科書。在商務出版的有「文化讀本」，「李氏文範」，「李氏英語修詞作文合編」，「今日中國之重要問題」等。「文化讀本」國難後已達六七版，「李氏英語修詞作文合編」為今日中國僅有的英文修詞學，曾有翻印，被商務發現，翻印者被罰二百元。我問他何以最近不著書，他說「我本預備編一部世界史和一本世界地理，村料已搜集，但是我的Wife死了，我沒有心編了」。從此我們可以想像他與他的夫人伉儷的情篤。</p>
<p>讓我們祝李老博士健康吧。</p>
<h3>各書局印象記（續）</h3>
<p>— 李衡之</p>
<p>開明—新生命—黎明—華通</p>
<p>（四）開明書店——由新女性雜誌社蛻化出來的開明書店，在後起的新書業中，算得是較成功的一家。</p>
<p>為了婦女雜誌上發表了較激烈的婦女問題的論文，章錫琛脫離了商務。在一家一樓一底的住宅中，幾個朋友計議出版一種婦女問題的刊物，為發行刊物的方便，自然又需要一家書店。新女性雜誌即和開明書店同時產生。正和北新的初創推動了初期新文學運動的怒潮一樣，開明的初創介紹了許多進步的婦女問題的學說。新女性上關於「自由戀愛」及「自由性交」問題的論爭，掀起了一個大波，雖則因不滿婦女雜誌的保守而退出商務的「章老板」及其「社員」，在這次論爭中，畏縮地維護着所謂性霪的「戀愛」，但柯崙泰的戀愛論等終於也在這個時候介紹了進來。</p>
<p>開明書店在另一方面，可說是中學敎師的集團，在文化界中，他們有他們超然的一派。自「新女性」走到了無可發展的盡頭，他們便很聰明的和「一般」一同結束，這對於開明是有益的，他們發現了他們的長處，這個轉變，使開明推向另一條新的路上發展，那便是中學課本及一般中學生讀物的輯編。在這一點上，開明奠定了它的基礎，後來雖有什麼「中畢生書局」等來模倣，但沒有一個能趕上開明的。</p>
<p>就性質來說，開明的幾種中學課本不能不說是較優秀的，雖則他們想由中學課本而推進到小學課本，在去年，小學課本上曾受到一些虧折，然書的本質還是不錯。</p>
<p>不過，不景氣籠罩着新書業，開明沒有這種魄力可以和商務一樣，超然不受其影響。最近二十五史等大部舊書的印行，其意義並不是說，開明更進步了，而是恰恰相反，開明在新書出版上已感到枯竭，而為了吸收現金，更不得不以巨量的書來賣「預約」。其次，開明之興，由於「章氏一家人」似的「家庭工業式」的經營，而現在，開明的範圍日大，內部的關係日形複雜，必然的開支亦必大大地增加。這樣，如在出版上不能另打出一條新出路，這也未免不是開明的危機。</p>
<p>（五）新生命書局——淸黨後，「新生命月刋」取得了以前「新靑年」，「現代評論」，「嚮導」等最流行刊物的地位。差不多各方面的人，都在注視着「新生命」。新生命書局遂在「新生命月刋」的迅速發展中成立。</p>
<p>就實質言，當時新生命書局和民智書局等相類似的「黨機關書局」。三民主義的讀物，幾為該局所包辦。但在一般人的心目中，却並不以「機關書局」視之，新生命的許多新興社會科學的書籍，頗為一般讀者所歡迎，而且，也可說，在當時，祇有新生命書局尙能供給讀者在進步的社會科學方面一些新書。其別一刊物「社會與敎育」，更曾獲得極廣大的讀者，這不是矛盾嗎？這是新生命書局為他人不能及之處。</p>
<p>隨新興社會科學的衰落，新生命書局亦曾沉悶過一時，而現在又在恢復其原有的朝氣了。對於中國社會史硏究的專籍，新生命出版者大半。最近「食貨」的發刋，以新的方法，來硏究中國社會史的意義上，也不能說不是劃了一個階段。</p>
<p>（六）黎明書局——提起黎明，常有人把它和開明相並稱，實則黎明的方向和開明不同，其相同的地方，祇是：黎明也有個別的書局所沒有的特點。</p>
<p>黎明在初創時，可以說是一個大學書店，所出版的書，均是篇幅浩繁的大學課本及社會科學名著，這是其他的書店所視為畏途，也是其他的書店所引為可驚的。接着黎明在農村復興運動發生以前，出版了許多關於農村問題方面的書籍，不久又出版了許多鄕村敎育的著作，在事前，頗引起一般「追波逐流」者的不解，但事後，我們不能不說這是黎明的特別地方。</p>
<p>記得黎明以前發刊的一本刊物上，曾表白其自己的方針說：新書業的歷史，祗是追波逐流彼此倣傚的歷史，如文學書潮流之後是社會科學書，其後是兒童書及敎課書，其後是翻印故書，各家並沒有一定的方針。「但是黎明在出版方面並不是沒有方針，反之，却有其一貫的方針。我們（黎明）認為新書業的重要使命，是以比較合理的智識，提供於一般的讀者，提高本國一般的文化水平。……我們……並不因有什麽誘人的波瀾而動搖，不但以前如此，以後我們還是如此。」</p>
<p>那是對的。譬如現在吧，在大家正在提倡「幽默」的時候，黎明出版的「世界文學」，態度是那樣的嚴肅。其另一刋物「中國農村」月刊的又是一般瞎吹農村復興，農村建設的人們所看了即感頭痛的。</p>
<p>（七）華通書局——一家由文化圈外的人所經營的書店，其命運，和大東一樣。在創辦時，何嘗不大吹大擂，但現在，也頗有日暮之感。</p>
<p>華通的書籍有一個特色，就是：並不特別壞，如世界大東的什麼「奇俠傳」，「哀史」，「百日通」等「禮拜五六」派的著作是沒有的。但同時，也沒有切合需要或較有價値的著作。以前華通曾有過一種介紹出版品的刋物（名中國出版月刊），其中介紹的文字，都是些不痛不癢，使人說好不成，說壞也不能的文字，這種精神也充分表現在華通出版的書籍上。</p>
<p>在以前，華通門市部是很能吸引人的，其特色是收羅廣，佈置佳，但不久即為別家門市部所壓倒，雖也曾應用什麼「拉丁區」的咖啡館為招徠，但就是這咖啡館本身，也沒有觀察到讀者的「需要」。</p>

<h3>無綫電殺蟲</h3>
<p>— 泡</p>
<p>在一架奇特的無綫電機前面，一位科學家把一個試騐管盛了六只活的蜜蜂，管口用棉花塞上，再用綫把這試騐管掛在那無綫電機前面的二塊方形的鋁板中間，隨手旋動機中的一個很大的變量耗阻器；這時鋁板中間，亦看不出什麽東西發生，幾秒鐘後，又把這無綫電機關去，將試騐管取下看時，奇怪！管裏面的蜜蜂，體態上雖沒有什麽改變，但是早已無生命的了，原來它們早已被一種看不見的波浪所殺死了。</p>
<p>上面所說是美國新裘賽州農事試騐塲（New　Jersey　State　Agricoltural　Experiment　Station）昆蟲部主任海利氏（Thomas　I　Headlee）、所做的試騐，目的在利用一種無綫電波，以撲滅一切久為人類敵患的農作害蟲。上節所說的無綫電機，除去不用天綫而代以二片鋁板，和所用的波長不　外，其餘和普通的發射機並無不同之處。</p>
<p>這樣發射的特別波長的無綫電波，植物遇到了，並無損害，但是任何昆蟲遇到，則在數秒鐘裏立卽死亡，而且死後的屍體上一些沒有創傷，連燒灼的痕跡亦絲毫沒有，不過體溫要比生前升高得多，據說昆蟲所以死亡的原因，是這種無綫電波在體內發生很高的熱力所致。</p>
<p>這種方法不僅專殺農作害蟲，更可推廣到其他方面，譬如罐頭食物就可以利用這種方法來殺菌，以資久藏。可惜這樣的無綫電波，需要很大的電力，所以雖然實騐室中是成功了，但是尙不能作商業上的實際應用，而須再作進一步的研究。</p>

<h3>單層綫圈自身電容量的計算法</h3>
<p>— 醒士</p>
<p>（一）一個新的公式</p>
<p>普通在高週率應用上，一個綫圈最重要的特質便是他的自感量和電阻。但是此外還有一特質，在某種情形下可與前二者，佔同樣重要的地位，而在一般上則常被忽略，這就是他的分佈電容量，或稱自身電容量。</p>
<p>在大多數的接法中，這自身電容量可以當作一個永遠跨在綫圈上面的固定小電容器，而使諧振週率的最高鍍受一限制。故一般而論，在設計一綫圈時，應使這自身電容量愈小愈好。若有一公式能從綫圈的大小求出，這電容量的値，那末這公式顯然有實際上的價値。</p>
<p>在一九三四年七月外國無綫電工程雜誌上有A．G．Palermo一文，叙述一個計算自身電容量的新公式的數學上的來源和實騐上的情形。這公式通用於長和直輕相彷彿（Same　order）的單層線圈。　　這公式是</p>
<p>其中Co為自身電容量（兆兆分法拉），D為綫圈的直徑，d為導綫直徑（不包含絕緣物）·S為螺距（卽二相隣導綫中心間的距離），都以厘米為單位。這公式可以寫成更簡單的式樣，如</p>
<p>K為常數，隨螺距與導綫直徑的比例而變，可從第一圖的曲綫求得。</p>
<p>為便利讀者將此曲綫放大計，另把各相當値寫在下面：</p>
<p>這公式的精確性　用十九個大小不同的綫圈加以蹬實，實騐　和計算値問密合的情形可看第二圖。</p>
<p>（二）螺距的重要</p>
<p>這新公式有最有趣的兩點，第一，就是那些單層綫圈的自身電容量和轉數的多少沒有　　。第二，假使線　的　徑一定，那　　　　　　　　　　　　而　。還有，這變化的情形很有趣，　是當相隣二導縫間的距離小於導綫直二徑時，導綫間空隙若縮小。自身電容量卽猛烈增加。反之·若二綫間的距離大於導綫二倍時·則空隙加大，對於自身電容量影響很微。</p>
<p>所以在特別需要减少自身電容量時（例如短波用的綫圈和阻流綫圈），對於這種長和直徑相彷彿的綫圈，吾個可以得到一個實用的法則，就是導綫間應留以空隙，使相隣二導綫間的距離大於導綫直徑的二倍。這個簡單的規則對於長較直徑大得多的阻流綫圈亦能大致適用，但不能得到準確的結果罷了。</p>
<h3>幾點關於短波收音機的話</h3>
<p>— 庸言</p>
<p>短波收音機的收程，實非廣播收音機之所可比擬於萬一。譬如用了八管或十管的收音機收聽歐洲的廣播播音，已覺十分困難，而且又限定在晚上沒有天電干擾的時候；反之，我們用了一架平凡的二管短波收音機，却能在白晝很有把握的收聽來自歐洲的短波電訊，効力之優異，自不言可知。</p>
<p>在一天二十四小時裏，淸晨最合收聽十六公尺段的短波電訊，中午則為十九公尺段，二十五及三十一公尺段則傍晚及黃昏間收聽最好，五十公尺段則最合晚間收聽。</p>
<p>調節短波收音機，確要比廣播收音機困難些，這點可以用數目來表示出來。譬如我們假定每十千　的地位，可以容納一個電臺，則廣播段一五〇〇至五五〇千週間，有九十六個電臺的地位；假使刻度盤分一百度·則每一電臺所佔的地位，大約有一度光景。而在短波收音機，則某枚綫圈可以包括的波長，約自二十至五十公尺，卽自一五〇〇〇至六〇〇〇千週，可以容納九百個電臺，刻度盤每一度間，須容下九個電臺；如此每一電臺所佔的地位當然狹得多，刻度盤略動一動，就跳去不少電臺。所以在短波機上，緩旋度盤是萬不可省，否則就應加裝所謂「波段放大」（Band　spreading）的設備。</p>
<p>那一式的短波收音機好？無極外差式呢還是回授式？這問題現尙無確切答復。據一般意見，二式的成績多很好，北較上無極外差式的選擇性好些·但是用件繁多，構造複雜：回授式則構造簡易，易於自製。所以我們自製短波收音機，以回授式為宜。</p>
<p>無極回授式收音機在十公尺以下，可　　　　　，　在十公尺以上，則因　　　太太，普通很少　用。</p>
<p>裝置短波收音機，對淤另件的　　應該特別注意，劣質另件萬不可用·尤其是射電週率電路裏的，完全應採用量上等製品·如預定以次等另件　三管機者，則　可以上品另件而裝二管機，反可得更好的成績。如　中有射電週率放大級的，則應有極完密的　隔，否則効力不顧。</p>
<h3>介紹簡而易製的振盪器</h3>
<p>— 楊方朱</p>
<p>這振盪器是在去年冬做的，因為它的易造及適合業餘研究的經濟條件，於實用上有不少幫助，故特為介紹。</p>
<p>應用零件為：</p>
<p>·〇〇〇五變量電容器連度盤一只二又八分之一吋直徑一又四分之一吋長膠木管一只</p>
<p>十二號或〇一號眞空管述座</p>
<p>一百十弗打二十五瓦電泡一隻或兩隻</p>
<p>·〇〇〇二五MFD電容器連二MEG柵漏</p>
<p>六呎長軟皮線連挿頭</p>
<p>七吋長七吋高膠木面板及底板各一張</p>
<p>線圈繞製用三十號雙絲包銅線密繞五十四圈於二十七圈處另分一頭</p>
<p>全機裝置如第一圖，線路見第二圖，接線時須於各接合處用膠布扎緊，方不致有觸電之慮。此機裝妥後可直接一百一十弗打交直流電源，如用於二百二十弗打電源，可再加一電燈泡連於第二圖虛線處。</p>
<p>將電抑頭挿入電源電座，電泡應發光與平時一般·〇一號則只有微光已足應付，勿再加大電泡電力，致〇一號燈絲易斷。</p>
<p>未應用之先，要預為校對其波長曲線，用一有小方格之紙於紙旁書明振盪器之刻度數，自零至九十或一百八十，將振盪器放置於近收音機二三呎處，轉動收音機使收已知的電台波長在六百千週左右，如上海之東陸廣播電台，然後轉動振　器至一點，收音機發生呌聲為止，卽可將振盪器上刻度數於方格紙所寫之度數橫格內註明六百四十千週，再於一千千週處及一千四百千週處作同一之校凖。</p>
<p>以後如欲試收音機之靈敏度或分隔力等卽可將此振盪器作為一電台，此器用為校凖T．R．F．收音機之雙連或三連電容器時又為凖確。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>祝母親節</h3>
<p>— 謝克</p>
<p>本月十二日爲母親節。上海婦女界對此節日將有重要紀念。在這裏我得發表一點關於這節日的意見爲這母親節祝。</p>
<p>母親節的重要意義便是怎樣使現代的婦女們知道做現代的母親底意義。這一意義是很重要的。現代所已做母親的，特別是中國的一般做母親的，大部還沒有明暸做母親的重要責任與義務。她們只知怎樣撫養兒女成長這便是她們唯一的責任。此外怎樣發展兒童的特長，保留其優點，除去其劣點，大都不很注意的。反之，在中國一般舊式家庭中尤其如此，一切腐敗陳舊的舊敎與惡習慣，反都把本來很天眞活潑的兒童都敎養變壞了。這是非加糾正不可的。再次，則是一般有錢人的家庭——特別在上海是這樣，只把兒童養成一種驕奢淫逸的習慣，這也是應加改正的。</p>
<p>然而話又說回來。其實今之母親節，也不過是上海幾位有聲名有地位的婦女界領袖們所熱烈歡迎慶祝的一個集會。一般做母親的，特別是下等人們，却未必有機會參加，而且也根本不會知道有這麽一回事。這又怎麽辦呢？有錢人的太太，養了孩子，可以交給奶媽大姐去照顧，而無錢人眞實的在做了一羣苦孩子的母親，但却不得參加這盛會，由此，我們可知這母親節其實是並未深入一般家庭，眞實在做母親的在這重要紀念日却並未能知道她們所應盡的義務與責任。</p>
<h3>炭夫之歌</h3>
<p>— 凈夫</p>
<p>幽美的春之山谷，往往應和着那柔和的鳴聲：『到鳥巢去摘茶喲』採茶婦婉轉的歌曲似的音嚮，漫飄的散盪着。無數的鄉民都問烏巢山去。也常常在靜穆的深林，風蕭蕭的盪着大自然的樂曲裏，飛躍着漢子們的帶笑的高聲：『到烏巢去燒火炭呵！火炭眞値錢。』也歌向山上去！那兒的高聳入雲，深邃無底似的烏巢山，以往，是週圍的鄉民的代代相傳的，取之不竭的寳庫。憑着壯健的雙手，勞苦的上烏巢山採茶，斬薪，取竹，燒炭，總有得飯喫呵！鄕民們都這樣歌唱着。</p>
<p>可是，現在靑山依舊，人事却全非了。深高廣闊的烏巢山上己聽不見那柔婉的採茶婦的歌聲，那漢子們的歡呌。烏巢山上，變成荒絕的深淵了。滿山的貨料，不復有人來採取了。只整日夜風嗚咽似的凄奏，掠過濃蔭的深林，蕭蕭的悲鳴！</p>
<p>那山窩一轉，每百步卽可見到的每個炭窰，是久經風雨的摧殘，而成一片廢土，沒人理會。僅有的那便是烏巢山的，現今算是唯一的老伴侶的老燒炭夫阿福了；他便還常常看到那傷心的破炭窰發着嘆息，以至於流淚。他從前是一個最和善的老人，臉上老是掛着笑容，每逢月之初一和十五，一定要上哈溪墟去理髮呢。可是，他的頭部，現在就活像一個雜亂的小山窩，頭髮和鬍子散遍頭部，露出一個焦黑的，儘是可怕的縐痕血筋浮脹着的臉孔。顫抖着嘴唇，搖着頸子，他一想到過去，就連站都站不住。他的心靈的底層只會暗哀歌着——我這老不死，將怎樣死法呢？老天爺？</p>
<p>這幾年來，南洋那黃金地似的番邦變了，歸鄉的番客們能買火炭去燒鴉片，燒茶葉，燉猪脚的，已是少到可憐，火炭便賣不出去了。鳳安公路又開成，貨物都可以正用肩頭去担負而飛去。烏巢山上及附近靠挑貨到城裏去的勞力們，特別是燒炭夫們的生路更絕了。火炭已不用他們挑去，挑去的那只有虧本價錢賣不到以前的三分之一。阿福老人，不願想那痛心的往事，往事却又偏偏要湧上心頭。這怎樣能忘記呢。老人惟一的兒子，那麽雄牛似的漢子，便因為火炭不値錢，每次只好拼命的挑重些，以致不到一年，便吐血而死，</p>
<p>附近的鄉村的人漸漸少了，逃飢逃荒，避匪避難，都一個個一陣陣的走開去，上那兒去呢！眞是天翻地覆，家鄉全都不要，祖宗可以丟掉，要找一個來買火炭的，那就像找皇帝那麽難。烏巢山上的採茶婦絕跡了。炭夫們也都棄了錢代相傳的炭窰，丟下從前是寶貝似的樹木，對阿福老人說：走呀，這年頭不對了，燒火炭只有餓死，誰要你的火炭呢？到別處去求生吧！但阿福老人却總想不出個道理，到那裏去投生呵？祖宗辛苦傳下來的家鄉怎麽可以丟掉呢。然而，老人現在是更想不出一個做人的道理，烏巢山像要絕滅了。他現在只會晴暗哀歌——我這老不死，要怎麽死法呢？……</p>
<h3>夜宿江灣</h3>
<p>— 斯全</p>
<p>雜花生樹的春天，江南是旅行的季節呵！但是——街頭送來了加萊馨的賣花聲，夏的信號在姑娘們身上顯示了特有的記號；雖然你可以把這未踐的希望付託在第二個春天，然而去年不是這樣地期望過來的嗎？如今已是不見亂飛着的羣鶯底行蹤了！</p>
<p>星期尾的晚上，一個偶然的約會中，乘一路電車上天通庵車站，依稀的電炬隔離了騷亂的都市之夜，覺得僅是一天的遨遊，够償兩年來的宿願了。火車上的坐位，舒適地安排着，迎窗送進來的風中，挾着一股不知名的氣息。將沉重的頭顱，安放在椅背上，燃了一枝淡味的烟捲，夢魂似的注視着瑣碎的烟屑，幾乎停止了一切的思潮。一聲汽笛在靜穆的夜室中呌起來的時候，纔勾引起我的目光向窗外瞥去，樹叢，房舍，在昏黃的路燈下向後逝去，那樣迅速，或許那是個名勝的景地呢！想起霓虹燈光下高速度的動態，誰能否認這不是江南的旅行呵！</p>
<p>朋友們在江灣車站等候我，更有一條高大的狗，牠親愛地嗅着我的鞋尖，（大概我帶來了混濁的氣息呢！）低聲地吠着，歡迎我這次最短距離的旅行，就當先向黑暗的街道衝去，作地主之誼的嚮導牠們的同類高踞在汽車上的時候，或許沒有夢想到這裏更有一個自由的世</p>

<p>毘接煤屑路的盡端是江灣的市中心。一家茶樓沒有歇業，幾個粗野（自然也是種率直哩）的木地人，用脚掌蹲在板凳上，把壼談心，我猜想他們談到去年張天師作法求雨的故事吧；初夏的太陽威逼着他們勾起大旱的傷痕啊！</p>
<p>雖然從大街向西走去，脚底下漸漸不平穩起來，街燈更是出奇的灰暗，那頭狗忽然在前狂吠起來，有一個龐大的怪影倒在地面上，是一所頹毀的房屋的側影，後面更强調地襯着新建的樓房。我突然憶起那次大屠殺的殘劇來了，我朋友的家不是受了戰爭的賜與而重建的嗎？那末，用脚掌蹲在板凳上茶客或許傷心地演述帝國主義砲火下的慘像吧？</p>
<p>轉入小徑，燈火閃爍於竹圍之間的便是朋友的家了。街燈到這里為北，前面一片無休止的黑暗。野的犬聲更是高嘷着，我幾乎懷疑身入神奇的傳記中了。友人輕輕地叩籬門，應門的是一頭吊着嚮鈴的錦毛狗，嬌小可愛，見了主人又一撤腿跑得無影無蹤。</p>
<p>登樓，開了南向的窗，天是高的，繁星閃着媚眼，她們彷彿得了塊自由自在的天地似的，不受霓虹燈的威迫，發輝她固有的光明。在她籠罩下的周遭，純潔而靜穆，微風拂過樹林，像悅耳的音樂，蛙聲唱和着，更覺奇趣。</p>
<p>主人特為我們製菜沽酒，對於這種殷勤的欵待，我們開懷暢飲起來。我已經實踐了江南的旅行季節呵！我將永遠懷念着這個偶然的機緣，雖然那些姑娘們的身上已飄起了夏的信號。</p>
<h3>龍眼花開的時候</h3>
<p>— 小林</p>
<p>池塘裏的水蓮飄着淸芬的時候，牆頭的柘榴纍纍結着粉紅的果子的時侯，當龍眼花開綻的時候，就是我們踐行深固的心約的時候。</p>
<p>如今龍眼花不只開過，而且脫落，孕着胚胎了，可是南國的玲玲為什麽沒有一絲兒消息來呢？惦念着的心懷是多悒鬱啊！每天，我彷彿摘去了靈魂一樣，時時老是倚在窗口，悶悶地瞧着街下的街景，用着一顆疑慮的而又熱切的心，等待綠衣使老替我帶來了玲玲密柑味般甜潤的句子，然而天狠快便黑了下來了，我可不得不失望地離開了窗邊，退回來嘆了口氣，這樣地一天等過一天，一刻挨過一刻，時間在忽忽地飄了去，待候的心漸漸地淡了，但是惦念玲玲的感情却反而更加增長起來。為着玲玲使我負担着太多的愛戀的份兒，她曾經使我的心湖蕩着無邊的波瀾，在我這流浪人的心境上，寂寞遼遠的旅程上，玲玲就是我長途勞頓的最後的綠洲，雖然我的身子和玲玲的身子被重疊的山重疊的海分隔着，重疊的山和海却攔不了兩顆心的暗合，我不可沒有海的那邊的玲玲給我無限的精神的滋養，如同玲玲需要海的這邊的我的渴念一樣。我還深深地記住當那臨別的時間，是一個夜晚吧，天上沒月亮，　沉沉的，只有幾隻星子在盼着眼，玲玲到江岸送着我，海浪一陣陣湧上來，撞襲着船舷嘩啦一聲又退下去，風是冷的，我凝望着無邊的黑暗的海，想着自己就將讓這船載着飄浮去了，為什麽便要這樣離開你呢？我顫着咽子說着，在那樣的情景下，我不禁有點悵惘了。玲玲聽了我的話，抬了腦袋媚媚地望了望我，　住我的左手說道：時間很容易過的，龍眼花開的時候，我們又可見面了。</p>
<p>「龍眼花開的時候」玲玲這長長的日子中，我那個時候不唸着這一句為你所唸着的信語。春天在柳條依依中透露到人間了。接着夏日又在喧鬧的蟬鳴聲裏來了。玲玲，龍眼花開過三度，又三度結果子了。北國是無從瞧見龍眼樹的，遙想南島早開的龍眼又該是滿滿的白色的花朶了。</p>
<p>而我們的心約何時也結果子呢，玲玲。你不至於把那金的誓言看得雲烟那麽輕吧，這我也難料，悠悠的三年間巳經是音訊渺茫。在那同樣孤寂的日子裏，也說不定你會熬不住孤寂的侵蝕而變了心，撕碎金色的誓言。我早就從友人的口上聽到你另嫁了人的消息。並且來到北國作蜜月的旅行，我總是不信，雖是留神去打探也終無由得着一個眞情。</p>
<p>珍重扶植了三年的光陰的夢已碎了我還想着什麼呢？流浪人勞苦的旅程終歸是勞苦的，我算是卸了一重心事，好讓我開始永恒的流浪了。</p>
<h3>東大池</h3>
<p>— 陳里昂</p>
<p>雖已久隔了一年，而路途還依稀的認識，一個灣又一個灣，一頂橋又一頂橋。路是被攤開在澗溪的旁邊，路又被曲折得像蚯蚓似的，靜伏在麥隴的盡頭，近午時的白熱的陽光，混和在澄淸的泉水裏了，流過窈窕的蘆梗，流過靑和硃色的，不整齊的石塊。帶着一些管弦的幽聲，帶着幾枝嫩綠的柔弱的浮萍。「胳哩唏哩」地流着，流着……浮萍的命運是水主宰着的呵。</p>
<p>可是，我們這一夥，走得那樣的緩慢，浮萍兒似的，蕩漾在溫和柔潤的氣流中。我是懷着孤僻的情緒，沿路流覽着各色景物，古墓頹牆裏矗站着的高而苗條的松樹，把它象徵一個不拔的丈夫？把它象徵一個女人的腰肢？把它象徵老年人的唏臂？「哦，那邊孤單單的一株，不是去年我還給它留了一張照嗎，它不是還像認識我而在笑着點頭嗎？」自己默然地痴想着，假使植物有靈性智覺的話，它一定要說：「朋友，你怎的瘦萎了呵，你和去年大不同了，你……？」</p>
<p>是的，只短短的一個時期呢，環境更換了，生活更換了，心坎更換了，容顏亦都更換了。雖說，在我的身邊，依舊是那幾位知友，佩麗姑娘依舊是那副天眞的姿態，從溪畔拮取幾支紫色的草花，笑嬉嬉地挿上我的衣襟，再帶跳帶奔的走在前面，而我，我只能圓瞪着濕潤的眼，望着她的背形，把感謝之忱包含在苦澀的微笑中。「這樣好的天氣該放出點精神來啊！」梅雪掉過腦袋來喝一句。</p>
<p>從一個淺薄的夢中蘇醒回來似的。正走在東大池的石岸上了，楊柳的葉子長闊得像小魚，稀疏的浮在水面，一些微風挾着一些靑草氣息，輕微地撲過，激起一陣銀鱗在水上，泛着白色光，沒起波痕的水面是綠色的，綠色的樹木枝葉的倒影呢，池水自己是沒有色彩的，完全仗着週遭環境的反映，假使在一個黯晦風雨的日子，那就不會呌人們去留戀她了。</p>
<p>東大池被幾個山峯緊緊地擁抱着，她隱身在萬綠叢中·似乎故意希圖避去那批庸俗的，平日緊繫在聲色貨利上的耳目。假使是個陌生的遊客，就是當地車夫亦不會把這幽冷沉寂的境域推薦的，他們以為最好的去處，是堆砌得幾乎成了大假山的黿頭渚滿眼朱紅欄杆的蠡園，人聲嘈雜的惠山·和那架如死屍般躺臥在湖面上的六十二環洞的灰色長橋，而這許多刻板，惡俗，煩囂，和洋化文明的醜態，東大池是沒有的，所以我獨愛這並不使人注意的境地。</p>
<p>佩麗和梅雪引着我的朋友登山去了，而我還坐蹲在那半月形的石堤上，瞧着水中那幾支黃色的野水仙，那幾支不知名的深紅色的草葉，桃樹雖已不及春天那般濃艷，姿態却仍逗引着人們的回憶，而起光陰似流水之感。山木株株，各依適宜的地位，或矗立，或灣腰，或仰首，或作撲勢，向山風吹噓，白雲幽閒地從這個山頂飄到那個山頂。我不忍離去這靜美天然的境域。佩麗站在半山腰裏的那座石屋前，扯高着尖銳的嗓音：「眞的……你一生一世生活在東大池了嗎？」當我起步走到山脚下的時候，她把松花果摘下往我身扔上。</p>
<h3>主的滋味</h3>
<p>— 西蒙</p>
<p>一路進了門他的顆充滿着熱望的心便不禁馬上冷了半截，為因他看見坐在客堂上邊的叔叔分明瞥着走進來的自己！却反把視綫扔了開去，管自跟着客人攀談，也許那是出於一時的忽略，為着證明這個猜想的凖不凖，於是他故意踏若更響亮的脚步子，但是對方仍舊繼續着他的高聲的拉扯，讓他單個兒靜靜地坐着冷凳板，光景就像不理睬他，也像等於沒有他那麽一個人存在那裏一樣，而在有個面生的客人以着奇異的服光注視到他身上的時候，將使受注視的人感到一種怎樣難堪的刺激，他如同遭受刑罪的忍耐着坐了好一會兒，客人終於先後走了，現在只勝下他們兩個子，</p>
<p>送走客人，叔叔扳轉身子走回來，這才開始發見似的，微微點一點腦袋，另後冷冷的問着：</p>
<p>「你有什麽事」，比着剛才起勁的嘴臉，簡直成了兩種模樣，像兩個人似地。</p>
<p>想着：有事才來啦，就是沒事難道也不可上你家來。為什麼竟然說這樣的話和做着這樣的態度，一下子幾乎呌他不敢站相信，站在跟前的卻就是自己的叔叔。</p>
<p>差不多連開口的勇敢都消失了，他發怔似的呆住着，</p>
<p>這樣便各自默默的對坐着，叔叔儘管抽噓着雪茄，嘴巴像是緊潔了再也不會張開來，他斜眼悄悄瞟着叔叔一面鐵搥出來一樣着表情的臉孔，身上不覺一陣冷一陣熱的發燙着，彼此沒聲響地挨過了一些時間，叔叔用着不禁憚煩的神色打了幾個欠呵，站起來，預備離去的樣子。</p>
<p>他不得不趕着囁嚅地說了：</p>
<p>—叔叔，過幾天要替爹做七旬祭，發貼子用你叔叔的名字，跟你說知道，他以為這宗事祇要吿訴一聲兒就行，在如一家人的密切關係上，叔叔無論如何是會答應的，而且也該有份做着這個的義務，况且這又不要動一動，或用點兒勁。</p>
<p>然而聽了他的話，叔叔可縐着眉尖，一種不大願意不待說明便很淸楚的表示着，踱着方步，彷彿在思索一件不易應付的事，隔了很久，才說道：</p>
<p>——為是好的，不過……</p>
<p>——不過，怎樣叔叔你說。他有些着急的問着，</p>
<p>——我想不要用我的名最好，</p>
<p>他明白叔叔是在存心的推諉，甚至於把自己看成外人了。</p>
<p>這一切，使他戚到驚異與不解。</p>
<p>可是他明瞭不用叔叔的名出頭，藉叔叔在社會交際塲上些許的情面，不能在賀客的賀儀上多點收獲，却料想不到準沒有什麽不可以同時是必要做的叔叔，竟加以拒絕了。</p>
<p>——叔叔，無論怎樣是非你出名不可的。爹爹是沒了，除了你之外，誰還有這身份兒。</p>
<p>他的口吻漸漸地變成一個懇求他人帮忙自己的口吻了。但是任便他如何婉言，說個不休，他叔叔一逕是保持堅决的拒絕，全沒有磋商的可能。而被纏得叔叔簡直冐火了：</p>
<p>——我說不能用就是不能用，你別多嘴。</p>
<p>樣子是整個兒弄殭了。（未完）</p>

<p>今朝呀只有今朝，</p>
<p>我還能忍受痛苦的前煎熬，</p>
<p>明朝喲，明朝，</p>

<h3>「風雲兒女」即將公映</h3>
<p>電通全部有聲對白歌唱新片「風雲兒女」，已經全部攝製完成，即將繼「國風」後，公映於金城了。</p>

<p>(Beiping) Long Yun telegraphed the Yunnanese sojourners association in Beiping on the 9th, stating in brief: This time, the Communist bandits took advantage of the Yunnanese army's pursuit and suppression in Guizhou, stealthily infiltrated Yunnan, taking remote routes to avoid interception. They gathered at Songming and Xundian. However, within Kunming, due to thorough defenses, they did not dare to intrude. The security of the provincial capital was also not affected in any way. Currently, our troops have already been redeployed and are pursuing them to the Yuanmou and Yongren riverside, where they should be completely annihilated soon.

<h3>Xu Xiangqian's Bandit Troops Have Become Fish in a Cauldron</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Xu's bandits have recently been besieged by various armies and have become fish in a cauldron. Currently, one group is located around Chenjiaba Doukou Temple. Xu Xiangqian and Zhang Guotao, the two bandits, are both directing operations in the area, attempting to flee urgently in a southwest direction. Because they have repeatedly failed to capture Jiangcheng, they are quite panicked and already showing signs of retreat. The two bandits Zhu and Mao are attempting to cross the Jinsha River stealthily. They are engaged in fierce battles with Liu Wenhui's troops around Tong'an and Baidu. The bandits initially thought they could drive straight in, but quickly suffered setbacks upon arrival, and their attempted incursions will definitely be difficult to realize.

<h3>Liujiang Coal Mine Dispute</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong stated that the provincial government has received a report on the Liujiang Coal Mine incident and has decided to order local negotiations for a resolution, with Linyu County Magistrate Yuan Tai responsible.

<h3>Judicial Yuan's Interpretation on Doubts Regarding the Return of Security Deposits</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Judicial Yuan recently issued the following interpretation regarding doubts about the return of security deposits: (1) According to Article 425 of the Civil Code, in a lease agreement that should continue to exist, the transferor's contractual rights and obligations to the lessee are transferred to the transferee. The security deposit paid by the lessee on that day is part of the original agreement and can naturally be returned by the transferee. (2) When the lessee terminates the lease, they can request the transferee to return the security deposit, as mentioned above. If the transferee claims that there are reasons why the security deposit should not be returned, or if the lessee is unwilling to hand over the leased property before the security deposit is returned, these are matters that can only be resolved through litigation and cannot be directly enforced.

<h3>Achievements of the Ministry of Railways in Consolidating Railway Debts</h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>The Chinese government, recognizing the urgency of developing transportation, has been actively engaged in the consolidation and construction of railways in recent years. However, based on past experience, the funds for railway construction have always been raised from abroad. In the current situation, this need is even greater than before, making the acquisition of foreign capital the focal point of railway construction. The movement of foreign capital, while dependent on the capital export capacity of the respective countries, is also significantly influenced by the creditworthiness of the borrower. China's external credit has improved in recent years due to the stabilization of the political situation. Although there has been no large-scale consolidation plan for foreign debts, their prices have generally risen. In particular, the old practice of military personnel requisitioning railway funds has been abolished, allowing the railways to devote more resources to consolidating debts. As a result, market prices have risen even more rapidly. Regarding the debt repayment capacity of various railways last year, the situation is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The bonds of the Beining, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo, and Jiaoji Railways were all able to repay principal and interest according to contractual stipulations.</p>
<p>(2) The bonds of the Beijing-Shanghai and Bian-Luo Railways only paid interest once in the previous year. Last year, they paid interest twice according to the contracts.</p>
<p>(3) The original and supplementary loans of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway did not repay any principal or interest in the previous year. Last year, the German-issued portion of the original and supplementary loans paid interest once.</p>
<p>(4) The redemption bonds and rolling stock purchase loans of the Daqing Railway were partially repaid with interest or principal and interest successively.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, the foreign material debts of various railways, such as the Pinghan, Tianjin-Pukou, and PingSui Railways, have all been scheduled for monthly repayments of certain amounts. The monthly repayment of the rolling stock pledge loan of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway has also increased from £4,500 to £12,500. Recent news indicates that the Japanese loan of the Nanchang-Xunzhou Railway, with long overdue principal and interest, and the loan from the Zhengjin Bank of the former Ministry of Posts and Communications, are also being considered for separate consolidation, according to foreign dispatches. All these indicate the painstaking efforts of the Ministry of Railways to maintain its creditworthiness.</p>
<p>As for domestic debts, the various old domestic debts managed by the Ministry of Railways amount to approximately 30 million yuan. Among them, the two securities of the Sulu and Zhelu Railways within the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway area, and the Zhejiang Railway bonds, total about 1.6 million yuan in principal and interest. It is said that they will be repurchased at half of their current liability. As for the securities of the Sichuan, Hunan, and Hubei Railways, although the bondholders have repeatedly appealed, there has been no concrete solution to date. The principal repayment of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway rolling stock bonds, issued in recent years, has been repeatedly postponed. There is still no news about the lottery redemption of the Cantonese-Han Railway commercial stock bonds. Currently, the Ministry of Railways is making every effort to plan the construction of domestic trunk lines, which requires a considerable amount of funding. Recalling the completion of the Cantonese-Han Railway, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, and Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, all were achieved with the assistance of the domestic financial community. Even the recent construction of the Jing-Shao Railway by the Jiangnan Railway Company relies on domestic capital. This shows that the realization of railway construction plans relies heavily on the enthusiastic support of the people. However, it can be asserted that obtaining domestic investment requires improving domestic creditworthiness. Fortunately, the amount of domestic railway debt is not very large. Given the current state of railway finances and the achievements of the Ministry of Railways in consolidating foreign debts, it should not be difficult to further consolidate domestic debts to improve its creditworthiness.</p>
<h3>French Foreign Minister Visits Russia and Poland Key to European Peace Arrived in Berlin En Route to Warsaw Received Formal Welcome from German Government</h3>
<p>The purpose of this trip is to consolidate the old Franco-Polish alliance Pilsudski unable to participate in talks due to illness</p>
<p>(Paris) Foreign Minister Laval departed at 7:00 PM for Warsaw and Moscow to visit the governments of Poland and Russia. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>(Paris) In the next few days, French Foreign Minister Laval will discuss issues of great importance to European peace in Moscow and Warsaw. Laval left here this evening, first heading to the Polish capital and then to the Russian capital. A large crowd saw him off. Many considered Laval's trip to the Polish capital more important than his trip to the Russian capital, as it is now necessary to dispel the misunderstandings between the two countries caused by the German-Polish Treaty and the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Treaty. It is said that after Laval arrives in Moscow, he will try to turn the cold friendship between France and Poland into a warm one. It is reported that Polish dictator General Pilsudski is seriously ill and unable to talk to Laval. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The train carrying French Foreign Minister Laval passed through here this morning on its way to Warsaw. French Ambassador Poncet met him at the station and accompanied him to Frankfurt, informing him of the latest news along the way. Soviet Ambassador Suritz waited for him at the Seelhing station. The train stopped here for 21 minutes. The Russian Ambassador boarded the train to convey greetings from the Soviet government. Laval then returned to the platform and received a formal welcome from the German government. Laval was in high spirits and spoke animatedly. Other members of the French delegation conversed with German correspondents from the French press. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>Warsaw French Foreign Minister Laval will arrive here by train at 5:50 PM this afternoon. Preparations for the welcome are being made with every effort. Foreign Minister Beck will meet him at the station, but no one other than the reporters accompanying Laval will be allowed to enter the station. The police have dispersed idlers from the station, and only a small number of Polish reporters approved by the Polish Foreign Ministry are allowed to enter the platform. No further interviews with journalists will be allowed, in order to prevent the results of Laval's trip from being leaked to the outside. The key to this trip lies in the banquet on Saturday, which President Moscicki will also attend. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>Warsaw Official sources have released a formal communiqué stating that General Pilsudski, Minister of Military Affairs, is in poor health and that doctors have instructed him not to overwork himself. Therefore, the planned meeting with French Foreign Minister Laval has had to be canceled. According to private sources, Pilsudski has recently suffered from severe uremia. Although he has survived, he is old and weak, which is cause for concern. Pilsudski is 67 years old this year. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>Warsaw Former French Foreign Minister Barthou and current Foreign Minister Laval have visited Poland twice in one year, demonstrating France's deep concern for its Eastern European allies. This is a common topic of discussion in Polish public opinion. Most people believe that the Franco-Polish alliance will become even stronger in the future, which they see as fortunate. The Polish people attach great importance to Laval's visit. However, the government is somewhat reserved due to the recent signing of a mutual assistance pact between France and Russia. Government officials are eager to understand where France will place Poland among its Eastern European allies. Furthermore, diplomatic circles are concerned that Laval's visit may lead to a reopening of negotiations on the Eastern European Pact, which is also unsettling. In short, Laval's stay in Poland is too short to allow for a thorough study of all issues between France and Poland. However, there is hope of clarifying some of the points that have recently caused misunderstandings between the two countries. What we should pay attention to is that the Franco-Polish alliance needs to be maintained and strengthened, which is something that all people in Poland agree on. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Newspapers attach great importance to Foreign Minister Laval's stay in Warsaw prior to his visit to Russia and his meetings with Polish authorities. They believe that the Franco-Polish alliance still exists and does not contradict the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Pact. The New Era newspaper stated, "We welcome the Polish government's declaration of willingness to strengthen ties with France. This approach does not contradict the pacts we have already signed or the pacts we are about to sign, and it is the way to safeguard peace." The Figaro newspaper stated, "The German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact signed on January 26 of last year did not hinder the Franco-Polish alliance, so the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Pact does not obstruct the Franco-Polish alliance. The Mutual Assistance Pact is necessary to deal with reality, while the Franco-Polish alliance is the result of the traditional friendship between the two countries." (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Times published an editorial related to Foreign Minister Laval's trip to Warsaw, stating that Europe is aware of the current crisis and has rallied to support France's proposal, and has concluded an agreement to a considerable extent, stipulating the most effective measures to prevent such disasters. Since Soviet Russia concluded a mutual assistance pact with France, it has now joined the ranks of countries maintaining the European status quo. France's defense system may not be able to reduce armaments or ease the tense political situation, but this defense policy is essential, as Germany does not trust the peace aspirations of its neighbors.

<h3>Philippine Independence Issue Pre-Exposed If the United States Abandons the Philippines Japan Will Take the Opportunity to Invade The United Kingdom and Japan Will Also Come into Contact on the Island The Overall Situation in the Far East Will Be Disturbed</h3>
<p>Investigative Team Report Advocates Revoking the Independence Case</p>
<p>(Washington) Senator Gibson today submitted the second report of the committee that went to the Philippines last winter to the Senate, saying that if the United States abandons the Philippines, the United Kingdom and Japan may meet on the Philippine Islands, disrupting the entire situation in the Far East. The United States is about to withdraw from the Philippine Islands, while Japan wants to invade the Philippine Islands. For the sake of the Filipinos, the Filipinos should ask the United States Congress to revoke their independence case, because if the United States withdraws from the Philippine Islands, the United Kingdom may not allow other countries to block its trade routes or endanger the main road to Australia and many bases in the East. The United Kingdom and Japan will encounter common problems on the Philippine Islands, and the solution may lead to the conclusion of secret agreements, the division of world power, and the dominance of commerce in the islands. He is convinced that it would be better for the Philippine Islands to enjoy a kind of independence under the United States. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The US Congress previously organized an investigative team, chaired by Senator Tydings, a Democrat who drafted the Philippine Independence Act, to go to the Philippines to investigate the issue of Philippine independence. The investigative team has now returned to the United States. Republican Senator Gibson, a member of the investigative team, has submitted his own investigative report, advocating maintaining US sovereignty over the Philippine Islands. Gibson also declared, "If the United States abandons the Philippines, the United Kingdom and Japan will think that there are no other strong rivals in the Pacific. At that time, the United Kingdom and Japan will definitely conclude a secret agreement to divide the Pacific sphere of influence and share the trade rights of the Philippine Islands." As for Senator Tydings, the chairman of the investigative team, he has not yet submitted a formal report, because the opinions within the team are very divided, so much so that it is almost impossible for someone to draft a report and have it passed by a majority of the team members.

<h3>German Navy's Demand No Panic in the United Kingdom Combined Strength of the British and French Fleets is Sufficient to Cope</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Paris News reported that the British naval authorities did not feel as panicked as the newspapers reported regarding Germany's demand for naval power equal to 35% of the British fleet's tonnage. However, French Naval Minister Pietri did not express any opinion on the attitude of the British naval authorities after returning from London, where he recently met with British authorities to discuss the future naval conference. However, the newspaper stated that, according to reliable sources, the British authorities' view is as follows: The combined fleets of the United Kingdom and France have reached 2 million tons, and the fleet demanded by Germany is not a cause for concern. Furthermore, the construction of a navy takes a long time and cannot be strictly kept secret. Therefore, for these reasons, when the naval conference opens in October this year, the threat of Germany's demands felt by the United Kingdom will not be as great as Japan's demand for complete naval equality.

<h3>British Authorities Study Air Pact Plan</h3>
<p>(London) The various agencies within the Foreign Office have been studying the Western European Air Mutual Assistance Pact plan in recent days. As far as the general public knows, the result of the research is to advocate combining the Air Mutual Assistance Pact with the Air Military Equipment Restriction and Military Aviation Supervision Pact, and it is believed that civil aviation also needs to be supervised. If so, the proposal for the internationalization of civil aviation, which has been repeatedly proposed, will be reconsidered in the future. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) The House of Commons is scheduled to discuss national defense issues on May 25. According to responsible sources, the government will still adhere to the memorandum submitted at last year's disarmament conference on the issue of air force armament. The memorandum advocates a standing disarmament committee. If it cannot decide to completely abolish air force armament within two years, then countries should be allowed to possess air forces, the numbers of which should be specified separately and completed within eight years. According to the principles stipulated in this memorandum, the German Air Force can be on an equal footing with other countries eight years later, but at present, the production of German aircraft should be controlled and not allowed to increase freely. Furthermore, strict supervision must be carried out to avoid violations when this plan is implemented. As for the immediate air force measures that the United Kingdom is advocating, they can be implemented slowly if countries can reach an agreement, and it is advocated that an Air Mutual Assistance Pact be concluded before restricting air force armament. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) Although the House of Commons will debate national defense issues on May 22, it is said that the result of the debate will only be to approve the air defense plan adopted by the government. In fact, the government has begun to make various preparations for the air defense plan. The Aviation Department has notified various aircraft manufacturing plants to increase production capacity as soon as possible so that they can immediately start construction when they receive government orders. The government is now advocating public opinion to support the passive air defense plan. It is said that only the Labor Party will express its opposition when the House of Commons holds a debate on May 22, while the Liberal Party will vote to pass the government's proposal.

<h3>Sanction Clauses of the League of Nations Covenant: Research by Spanish Representative</h3>
<p>(London) The Spanish representative to the League of Nations, Madariaga, recently published an article in the Daily Telegraph, studying the possibility of implementing the sanctions stipulated in Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, stating: "Collective life cannot exist without discipline, and without sanctions, there is no discipline. Regarding economic sanctions, economic life has its own laws. Even if countries are justified, it is impossible to erase economic laws and change economic life. Therefore, the method of implementing discipline should be sought in other aspects, and public opinion is the only suitable method. Without the support of public opinion, engaging in sanctions will only be laborious and fruitless. If there is public opinion as a backing, sanctions can become a necessary measure."

It is reported that Socialist leader Devigne has studied this matter and that a formal delegation will soon be sent to Moscow for negotiations. Belgium has not yet recognized the Soviet Russian government due to moral and legal reasons, and the anti-religious movement in Soviet Russia has been the main obstacle to recognition. However, since the Belgian scientific delegation visited Moscow last month and received a warm welcome from Soviet Russia, this attitude has changed significantly. If Belgium decides to restore diplomatic relations with Russia, the only European countries that have not yet recognized Soviet Russia are the Netherlands, Switzerland, Portugal, and Albania.

<h3>Two Major Soviet Anniversaries: Japan Publishes Information on the Strength of the Russian Air Force</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet Union recently celebrated two major anniversaries: the fifteenth anniversary of the founding of the All-Union Arctic Institute and the first anniversary of the rescue of the Chelyuskin crew. The Arctic Institute is the only scientific institution in the world dedicated to studying various issues in the Arctic region. The institute applies various scientific research methods to control the Arctic Sea Route and the northern regions of the Soviet Union, which account for half of the Soviet Union's territory and one-twelfth of the world's land area. Soviet scientists first sailed in a small boat, navigating through ice floes and giant waves for thousands of kilometers. They traveled from the south around Novaya Zemlya and through Berush Bay to Matocskin Shar. This was unprecedented. By 1934, 85 ships had navigated the Soviet Northern Sea Route. The world's most powerful icebreakers crossed the Arctic Ocean. There were 37 radio stations, dozens of aircraft, well-equipped laboratories, and thousands of Arctic explorers engaged in systematic research. The Imperial Russian government did not attempt to solve the problems of the Far North, while the Soviet authorities consistently aimed at exploring and developing the Arctic Ocean. In 1920, there were four groups of explorers working in the western Arctic. From 1920 to 1924, exploration work continued, but it was limited to the west due to the ongoing civil war, which made it impossible to enter the east. Years later, geological stations were established in Novaya Zemlya and Matocskin Shar to conduct regular research. From there, the work of Soviet explorers and sailors gradually extended northward. Explorers and aviators also formed stable groups. The Arctic Institute began to study the Tokotsk National Region, surveying the terrain and mapping the area by aircraft. The explorers assembled and trained by the institute soon became world-renowned. In 1928, Soviet explorers, aboard the Krasin icebreaker, rescued the Italia airship, further enhancing their reputation. In 1929, Professor Schmidt, the first director of the Arctic Institute, led a team aboard the Sedov icebreaker to Franz Josef Land and established the world's northernmost geographical research station. In 1930, explorers Oshimao, Urvantsev, and others wintered on Severnaya Zemlya, conducting large-scale scientific work. They explored these islands for 151 days, on foot, by dog sled, or on skis. They traversed 3,000 kilometers, surveying approximately 40,000 square kilometers. They also studied local meteorology, biology, ice conditions, and hunting and fishing practices. They discovered several new islands, straits, bays, and capes. In 1931, Soviet scientists participated in the German Zeppelin's exploration of the Soviet part of the Arctic Ocean, and oversaw its scientific work. In 1932, the Soviet Union attempted to solve the Northern Sea Route problem. Professor Schmidt led a team aboard the Sibiriakov, traveling from Arkhangelsk along the Northern Sea Route to Vladivostok, solving the problem of greater Hokkaido. The Central Administration of the Northern Sea Route further sought to extend the route from the White Sea to the Bering Strait, and to ensure the safety of navigation on this route, leading to the voyages of the Chelyuskin and Litke crews. In 1934, the icebreaker Litke traveled from Vladivostok to Murmansk in 85 days. Several ships were sent to the mouth of the Lena River. This was unprecedented in history. The main task of the institute is to quickly control the Northern Sea Route and its adjacent areas, to investigate the mineral resources of northern Russia, and to survey and map the area. At the same time, to facilitate navigation on the Northern Sea Route, it is currently studying the hydrology, hydrogeology, and ice patterns of the Arctic Ocean. In the past two years, exploration work on Novaya Zemlya has been completed. Polymetallic minerals have been discovered near Matocskin Shar and the Oktu Sorov Islands. Attention has then been focused on the Lena-Taymyr region. Coal mines have been discovered for the first time at the mouth of the Olene River, and oil fields have been discovered at the mouth of the Hatan River and in the Norwick Bay. Coal mines have been discovered in the Kolyma and North Khorola River basins, and polymetallic minerals have been discovered on Vach Island. The institute is also investigating the apatite mines of the Chirinsky region. The low-water level on the northern and northwestern parts of Vaygach Island is under study. The icebreaker Sedov's expedition has mapped the currents of the Kara Sea. Scientists have also conducted extensive research on northern biology. The observations of the Chelyuskin crew from Murmansk to the Bering Strait are particularly interesting. The Litke icebreaker's expedition studied plankton to predict ice conditions in various areas. The main goal of this research is to study the condition of animals in the Ob Bay area. In the past year, 14 new meteorological stations and 4 new radiotelemetric stations have been added in the Arctic region. In general, the exploration work on the western section of the Northern Sea Route has been completed, and research on the eastern section has begun. (TASS, 9th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is well known that the Soviet Red Army possesses the largest number of aircraft in the world. However, the exact number is unknown to outsiders due to the Red Army's strict secrecy. However, the Soviet government recently published the number of military aircraft participating in the May 1st Labor Day demonstrations across the country, revealing its full extent. According to the Soviet government's announcement on the 4th, the number of aircraft participating in Labor Day was 3,000, of which 800 were in the Far East. This astonishing figure proves the content of the Soviet Union's so-called "armed peace." The statistics of aircraft participating in Labor Day in various regions are as follows: Moscow 800 aircraft, Leningrad 350 aircraft, Far East 800 aircraft, Minsk 350 aircraft, Kiev 300 aircraft, Kharkiv 170 aircraft, Rostov 100 aircraft, and other regions hundreds of aircraft.

<h3>U.S. House Passes Banking Bill: Silver Imports Plummet Last Month</h3>
<p>(Washington) The House today passed the government's banking bill.

If so, the bill will not be able to obtain a two-thirds majority. The bonus supporters hope to negotiate a compromise that the White House can agree to, but this hope has been shattered today by Democratic Senator Thomas, the leader of the expansionists. Thomas not only rejected all compromises, but is now trying to overturn the President's veto. This morning, President Roosevelt summoned Veterans Affairs Administrator Hains and Treasury Secretary Morgenthau to the White House for a meeting. No official announcement was made after the meeting. At the same time, the efforts of those promoting the bill's success have reached an unprecedented height. Veterans Commander Zander has even asked the American people to send one million telegrams directly to the White House, urging the President to approve the bill. Senators are also receiving telegrams requesting support for the bill, as many as snowflakes, as a result of Father Coughlin's radio broadcast. (National Telegraph, 9th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Supporters of Bateman's bonus bill claim that since the bill has been passed, it should only be sent to the President for implementation. They do not want a compromise.

<h3>Hitler Dissatisfied with Japan: Continues to Manage Mandated Territories; Hirota Issues Statement</h3>
<p>The Nagoya News reported on May 4 that British Foreign Secretary Simon, while discussing the issue of mandated rule in the House of Commons, expressed the following opinion of Germany's Hitler: Hitler's reason for opposing the return to the League of Nations is the issue of mandated rule, because Japan has withdrawn from the League of Nations, but still manages the mandated territories of the South Pacific Islands, which is unreasonable. The Japanese Foreign Ministry, upon receiving the report, issued an informal statement stating that Foreign Secretary Simon's speech in the House of Commons was delivered after a meeting with Hitler in Berlin. We have not yet received a formal report, so we do not understand its intentions. However, when the German Ambassador to Japan visited Foreign Minister Hirota on March 23, he stated that Germany had officially restored conscription, and Germany had no intention of considering the issue of the South Pacific mandated territories. Therefore, Foreign Minister Hirota stated this point at the General Budget Committee of the House of Representatives on the 23rd, clarifying that the Japanese government has fundamentally decided to continue managing the South Pacific mandated territories, and the other countries also understand Japan's opinion. The raising of this issue in London is incomprehensible. The Japanese government does not care about such dissent.</p>
<h3>U.S. Consulate in Beijing Decides to Expand</h3>

<h3>No Traces of Bandits in Shimen, Northern Hunan</h3>

<h3>Northwestern Inspection Notes</h3>
<p>— By Our Special Correspondent Geng Ya</p>
<p>An Overview of Education in Shaanxi Province</p>
<p>Shaanxi is located in the western border region, and education is not very developed. In addition, due to the aftermath of the famine, the rural economy has collapsed. In counties with more severe disasters, the past scale of education has largely disappeared. Fortunately, the years of famine have passed, and transportation is gradually developing. Although educational funding is only sufficient to maintain the status quo, the authorities are planning to implement measures that are easy to implement and meet current needs.</p>
<p>Regarding secondary education in the province, there are nine provincial high schools: Xi'an High School, Xi'an No. 1 High School, Xi'an No. 2 High School, Sanyuan High School, Sanyuan Girls' High School, Fengxiang High School, Nanzheng High School, Ankang High School, and Yulin High School. There are two joint county high schools: Nanzheng Joint High School and Shangxian Joint High School. There are five county junior high schools in Heyang, Hancheng, Luonan, Xixiang, and Nanzheng. There are six private junior high schools in Xi'an: Minxing, Minli, Rose Girls', Zunde Girls', and Xianlin in Huaxian and Licheng in Fuping. The Department of Education believes that most students in the schools are from farming families and are very poor. To realize the principle of equal educational opportunities, it has waived tuition and miscellaneous fees for students in provincial primary and secondary schools and provided scholarships to poor students since the 22nd year. This matter is particularly commendable.</p>
<p>There are seven provincial normal schools: Xi'an Normal School, Xi'an Women's Normal School, Dali Normal School, Nanzheng Normal School, Nanzheng Women's Normal School, Ankang Normal School, and Yulin Women's Normal School. Many are co-located with high schools, which has more disadvantages than advantages. The distribution of normal schools and high schools is mostly concentrated in the provincial capital or political centers, with little balanced development. Primary school teachers in the counties are in great shortage. Therefore, a primary school teacher training center was established in Xi'an last year to train incumbent primary school teachers from various counties in the province. Each term lasts six months, and graduates return to their original positions. This has been very effective in improving education in the counties. In addition, there are currently twelve or thirteen county normal training schools, but they have achieved little significant progress. The Department of Education's measures to improve normal education that have already been implemented include implementing an independent normal school system and dividing the province into eight normal school districts.</p>
<p>Regarding vocational education, there were originally two provincial vocational schools: Xi'an Agriculture School and Sanyuan Industrial Vocational Junior High School. There were two county vocational schools: Nanzheng Sericulture School and Tongguan Agriculture School. There was one joint vocational school: Yulin Wool and Leather Industrial Vocational School. There was one private vocational school: Xi'an Women's Civilian Vocational School. In total, there are six vocational schools. The Department of Education believes that Shaanxi can be naturally divided into three major parts: Yulin in northern Shaanxi is rich in wool production, Yanshu is suitable for reclamation and animal husbandry, Guanzhong is suitable for agriculture, forestry, and industry, and Hanzhong is suitable for sericulture, agriculture, forestry, and mining. However, all need improvement. In addition to taking over the Yulin Wool and Leather Industrial Vocational School as a provincial school and allocating funds from the provincial treasury to enrich its content, and planning to establish a Huayin Industrial Vocational School at the closed Huayin Arsenal, it also plans to establish various vocational schools adapted to the environment in each vocational education district year by year. It aims to achieve the standard of at least one or two vocational schools in each district within the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Primary education is underdeveloped everywhere, and the number of out-of-school children is very large. Now that the years of famine have passed, efforts should be made to expand compulsory education. It is currently conducting surveys on educational funding and school-age children in various counties in order to plan and complete compulsory education throughout the province. Regarding social education, in addition to the Provincial No. 1 Library and the Provincial No. 1 People's Education Center in Xi'an, and the Provincial No. 2 People's Education Center at Huaqing Pool in Lintong, a Xijing Cultural Museum is also being planned. The interior is planned to be divided into two museums: Ancient Artifacts and Science. One will collect ancient artifacts and study the origins of ancient culture, and the other will study science and pursue the path of modern civilization. When preparations are complete and officially opened, it will greatly benefit the progress of culture in the Northwest.</p>
<p>According to Qi Bowen, the chief editor of the Department of Education, Shaanxi's educational policy can be divided into two major outlines: one is national education, and the other is productive education. The focus of implementing national education is on (1) local education and (2) health education. In terms of productive education, attention is paid to (1) vocational education and (2) rural education. Local, health, vocational, and rural education all have their own committees in order to specialize in research and be responsible for promotion. Qi also researched local education and described the importance of its meaning, briefly as (1) inspiring children's love for their hometown and cultivating the ability to understand their hometown so that they are happy to serve the local area, (2) cultivating national self-confidence from local beliefs, arousing national awareness, and inspiring the national spirit, from loving the local area to defending the local area, and (3) developing local production and industry and seeking to improve local undertakings, from defending the local area to building the local area.</p>
<p>Shaanxi does not yet have higher education. Some advocate for establishing a university, but funding, equipment, and teachers are all problems. The current remedial measures should be pragmatic, selecting more students to enter universities at home and abroad, providing them with public funding, and cultivating the talents needed in higher education. At the same time, agricultural, forestry, industrial, and other vocational schools should be added to create practical production talents. The central government plans to establish a national agricultural and forestry vocational school in Wugong. This matter is extremely necessary in terms of the environment and very effective in practice. It is hoped that it will be realized soon.</p>
<p>Whether the publication of local newspapers and publications is developed is always closely related to local culture and education. There are several newspapers in Xi'an: Xijing Daily, Northwest Culture Daily, Industry and Commerce Daily, Chao Bao, National Daily, and Xiao Bao. In addition, there are also various publications published by the Education Association, the Department of Education, and other institutions. Few are seen in the counties. The Xijing Daily has the largest circulation among the daily newspapers, but it only reaches 5,000 copies. The reason for this is mostly limited to objective conditions. At the First Shaanxi Provincial Games, the soft descriptions in the special issue of the newspaper included the phrase "standard beauty," praising the fitness of a female high jump champion, and there were also words such as "General Huang wags his tail and joins the track and field competition," describing a yellow dog that slipped onto the track in a playful tone. Unexpectedly, it aroused the resentment of a portion of the public, especially a certain director who believed that "General Huang" was alluding to him personally and was quite dissatisfied. At that time, the city was in an uproar, and the situation seemed quite serious. After the explanation, although nothing happened, the general social knowledge level of the area should be raised, and the popular education work in the future should be strengthened. From the occurrence of this type of interesting event, it is even clearer, without the need for further explanation.</p>
<h3>Bogus Organization Financial Collapse Phenomenon</h3>
<p>Bogus Currency Plummets, Chamber of Commerce Appeals, Public Panic, Cries of Suffering</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The bogus organization's issuance of paper currency and guarantees are insufficient. At a time when cash is in extreme panic in the Northeast, the bogus organization's finances are greatly shaken. Northeast silver flowing to Japan has reached six million yuan, so its financial panic cannot be alleviated. The "Setian" Provincial Chambers of Commerce Joint Association, in light of the plunging bogus currency and extreme public panic, specially convened 37 representatives from 34 southern counties to discuss countermeasures. Nine chambers of commerce, including Gaiping, Liaozhong, Changtu, Shuangshan, Beizhen, Fushun, Xiuyan, Xi'an, and Dadonggou, proposed that due to the disastrous fall of the bogus currency and widespread public anxiety, the bogus financial authorities should maintain their promise and uphold the "national" currency law to stabilize prices. The resolution stated that the currency system is the lifeblood of merchants and the people. If there are frequent instabilities, industry and commerce will inevitably suffer great losses. In the past, when Feng banknotes were scarce, 60 yuan were exchanged for one silver dollar, causing hardship for merchants and farmers and greatly damaging their vitality. Later, the bogus organization was established, implementing a unified currency system with 23.91 grams of pure silver as the standard price for the bogus currency unit, as stipulated in the bogus laws. Since its issuance, merchants and the people have gradually gained faith. Unexpectedly, the bogus financial authorities are now lacking cash and have no reserves, causing the bogus paper currency to fall daily, with a huge disparity from the fixed standard silver price. Calculated at the current exchange rate, every thousand yuan differs by more than 350 yuan, and it continues to increase daily, without end in sight. Panic prevails in the market, rumors abound, finances are extremely tight, turnover is sluggish, and industry and commerce have ground to a halt. Moreover, most industries and businesses in the Northeast have foreign investments, and profits and losses are calculated in silver dollars. If the bogus currency continues to fall, foreign investors, unwilling to suffer losses, will inevitably withdraw their capital. On top of the extreme shortage of cash in the Northeast, industry and commerce will be completely paralyzed due to financial collapse. This is not only the bankruptcy of industry and commerce but also the difficulty for the bogus organization to exist. At this critical juncture, businesses in various places are in dire need of rescue. It is a period of extreme financial danger that cannot be ignored. The bogus financial authorities should quickly maintain the pure silver standard price of the bogus currency, and so on.</p>
<p>Antung Correspondence: Since the bogus organization's financial authorities abolished silver dollars and Zhenping silver, bogus paper currency has become the sole standard circulating currency in the market. Other currencies, such as silver coins cast by China and gold notes issued by Japanese and Korean banks, can also circulate in the market, making the bogus organization's currency system very abnormal. However, silver dollars are real goods in silver, while bogus currency is a virtual standard paper currency, making it difficult to gain the trust of merchants and the people. Recently, the exchange rate of silver dollars has skyrocketed, and the exchange rates in various ports have also greatly increased. On April 28, the market price for every thousand yuan of silver dollars wired to Shanghai required 1,300 yuan in bogus currency, 1,310 yuan to Yantai, and 1,314 yuan to Tianjin. This is an increase of 30 to 40 yuan from the previous exchange rates, which is a major blow to merchants and has resulted in huge losses. On the 29th, telegraphic transfers to Shanghai were 1,318 yuan, and postal transfers to Yantai were 1,314 yuan, while postal transfers to Tianjin were 1,314 yuan and 50 cents. The exchange rate is rising daily and is exceptionally firm. The bogus Antung authorities intend to issue bogus orders to forcibly intervene.</p>
<p>Kaiyuan Correspondence: The Kaiyuan bogus county government, in view of the strange rise in silver dollars and the shortage of paper currency, with no end in sight, and the public's panic and cries of suffering, reported the situation to the bogus financial authorities and rashly took matters into their own hands, forcibly regulating market prices for merchants and posting notices everywhere. If merchants further raise prices or deliberately inflate them, they will be punished for disrupting finances and will not be pardoned, and so on. From this, we can get a glimpse of the plight of the people in various parts of the bogus organization. (Northeast News Agency)</p>
<h3>Remnant Bandits in Northern Sichuan Attempt to Disperse and Flee</h3>
<p>National Army Repeatedly Wins, Quickly Seizing Key Forts. He Chengjun Discusses the Encirclement of Hunan Bandits.</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Xu Xiangqian's remnant bandits in northern Sichuan, after a prolonged unsuccessful attack on Jiangyou, have had their left flank at Zitong, right flank at Pingwu, and rear at Zhaohua successively broken by the National Army, putting them in a dilemma. The bandits' attack on Jiangyou began in early April and has lasted nearly a month. Yang Shaixuan, the defending general, led ten companies of soldiers, fighting day and night, and finally managed to turn the tide. There were many heroic deeds of unity between the military and the people. According to the telegram from Brigade Commander Yang Shaixuan, the magistrate of Jiangyou County, and various agencies and organizations, the bandits attacked the city relentlessly day and night. Our officers and soldiers fought together, becoming extremely fatigued, and were also short of food. The local people collected and provided all their stored food to support the army. The other day, the bandits used houses as cover in a place several miles east of the city and dug tunnels, attempting to bomb the city. Our army took various defensive measures and built a new city within the city to defend against them. When the bandits' tunnel was completed, it exploded a few feet from the city wall. Fortunately, the defense was adequate, and the bandits did not succeed. Our army suffered only a few injuries. Now, Hu Zongnan and Wang Zanxu's troops have rushed to support as ordered. Chairman Chiang has also telegraphed Brigade Commander Yang to commend and reward the officers and soldiers of each route, further boosting their morale. The bandits are now extremely demoralized and, knowing that they will be completely annihilated if they remain besieged for long, they are trying to break up into smaller groups and flee along the sides of Jiangyou to Beichuan, Maoxian, Anxian, and other places in an attempt to enter Kang. The bandits' morale is disintegrating, which is being exploited by the National Army. Key fortresses such as Dayakou, Tuliling, Huanglian’e, and Lianghekou have all been recovered by the National Army. The main force of the military and bandits seems to be fighting within the borders of Beian and Kunlian.</p>
<p>The remnant bandits of He Long and Xiao Ke in western Hunan previously fled to the border of Hubei, where they were repelled by Xu Yuanquan's division and fled back to Sangzhi. When the border police were in urgent need, He Chengjun took a plane from Hankou to Shashi to inspect the defense and planned to fly to Changde to discuss with He Jian a plan to eliminate the remnant bandits. Now that He Jian has returned to Changsha and important officials from the Pacification Headquarters are in urgent need of attention, he took a plane back to Hankou from Shashi on the ninth and will go to Changsha in the coming days to meet with He and then go to Sichuan for support. When He met with reporters at the Pacification Headquarters, he said that the remnant bandits in western Hubei had long disappeared, the area was extremely peaceful, and the people were not abandoning spring plowing, with a good harvest expected in the future. The bandits of Xiao and He had previously fled to Ziliangping, on the border between Hubei and Hunan. After sending teams to strictly guard and vigorously pursue them, the bandits could not hold out and fled back to Sangzhi. They are now being surrounded by our army and should be completely annihilated within a considerable period of time. Whether he will go to Changsha again or go to Shashi again will be decided in two or three days. (9th)</p>
<h3>American Economic Observation Group Arrives in Peiping from Tientsin</h3>
<p>—Forbes Says Impressions of Trip Are Very Good—</p>
<p>Peiping Correspondence: The American economic observation group led by Forbes, a group of twelve, accompanied by Cheng Xigeng, a special envoy from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, arrived in Peiping at 6:42 this afternoon (9th) via the fourth Beijing-Ningbo train from Tianjin. More than one hundred representatives from various agencies and groups were at the station to welcome them. After the group got off the train and greeted the welcoming party, they took specially prepared cars from the reception office to the Beijing Hotel. The group's itinerary in Peiping was determined in advance by the reception office jointly formed by the Peiping Municipal Government, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On the 10th, they will visit He Yingqin and leaders in the business and banking communities in the morning. At 1 p.m., Mayor Yuan Liang will host a banquet for all the group members at the Jingfugge Pavilion in the Summer Palace. At 8 p.m., Mrs. Johnson, the wife of the American Minister, will host a reception at the embassy. On the 11th, they will visit the Temple of Heaven, the Imperial Ancestral Temple, and Zhongshan Park in the morning. At noon, they will attend a banquet hosted by the American Association. At 3 p.m., they will visit academic institutions such as the Geological Survey Institute and the Jing Sheng Biological Investigation Institute. At 5 p.m., they will attend a tea party hosted by Yuan Tongli, the director of the Peiping Library. At 8 p.m., He Yingqin will host a banquet at Jurentang. On the 12th, they will spend the whole day visiting the Great Wall and the Ming Tombs. On the 13th, they will rest in the morning and visit the Three Great Halls and the Palace Museum in the afternoon, and attend a tea party hosted by Ma Heng, the director of the museum. At 8:30 p.m., the business and banking associations will jointly host a dinner. On the 14th, they will visit Tsinghua University at 11 a.m. and attend a lunch hosted by Jiang Menglin, the president of Peking University, and Mei Yiqi, the president of Tsinghua University.

One part of the group will take the Peihan express train to Wuhan at 11 p.m. that night, while another part will go to Chahar, Suiyuan, and other places for inspection.</p>
<p>After the news of the group's departure from Tianjin reached Peiping, the reporter went to Fengtai to meet them. The train ride between Fengtai and Peiping takes half an hour, so with half an hour of time, I hoped to get some “exclusive comments.” I didn't initially expect Forbes, the group's spokesperson, to be extremely unwilling to talk about specific issues. What was discussed is recorded below: "I (Forbes refers to himself) have come to China for short trips in 1921, 1927, and 1931, so I am more familiar with your country's situation than the other group members. My impressions of what I have seen and heard in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Qingdao, and Tianjin this time are very good, because everything shows progress. Peiping is your country's ancient capital and famous place, and this is my first time here, so I can't talk about my feelings yet." Forbes continued, "Our group's visit to China does not carry any political mission. We are extremely grateful for the sincere hospitality of your country's government, business community, and financial community. My colleagues express our sincere gratitude." The reporter then asked what methods could be used to strengthen Sino-American economic relations. Forbes replied, "What you asked is precisely the central question that our group is studying. We sincerely hope that we can come to a conclusion in the future and make suggestions to the government. At the same time, we hope that leaders from your country's business and banking sectors will have thorough exchanges of views with our group," and so on. (9th)</p>
<h3>Kiangsi Province Cancels New Salt Tax</h3>
<p>Price of Salt Drops Two Cents Per Catty</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The revenue and expenditure budgets for Kiangsi Province in the 23rd year of the Republic are both over 17 million yuan, with revenues and expenditures in balance. Before the 19th year of the Republic, Kiangsi Province's finances were chaotic, with no budget to speak of. After the 19th year of the Republic, annual revenue was only 6 or 7 million yuan. In recent years, with the spread of banditry and a sharp decline in revenue, the ability to reach a revenue of more than 17 million yuan is due to the efforts of the authorities to rectify the situation, as well as monthly subsidies from the central government, local salt tax revenues, and the contributions from the bandit suppression and rehabilitation donations. This has enabled the supply of the urgent needs of collaboration, rehabilitation, and bandit suppression. Recently, the central government, considering that bandit communists in Kiangsi Province have been pacified and that the national treasury is extremely stretched, specifically cancelled the monthly subsidy of 250,000 yuan, causing the funding for the Kiangsi Province's team expenses to be without a solution. At the same time, the salt surtax (road construction and bandit suppression fund), which had been vigorously fought for and approved, is about to expire, so Kiangsi Province's monthly financial deficit of tens of thousands of yuan will be helpless. Therefore, when the central government previously suspended the collaborative funds, it added a tax of two yuan per picul on edible salt to provide emergency relief. The total salt tax in Kiangsi Province, including various surcharges, reached as high as eleven yuan per picul, which the people seemed to find difficult to bear. Fortunately, after the authorities and various circles in Kiangsi Province petitioned the central government vigorously, the central government agreed to subsidize 100,000 yuan per month, and the military headquarters subsidized 100,000 yuan. The original salt surtax levied for road construction and bandit suppression was also allowed to be postponed and abolished. The provincial government, with funding for the teams in place, immediately abolished the previously added salt tax of two yuan per picul this month. The market price of salt has now dropped by two cents per catty. (June 8)</p>
<h3>Minhou Farmers Resist Conscription for Road Construction</h3>
<p>Bandit Leader Lin Huaiqing Incites the People; Big Sword Society is Defeated by the Security Team</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The 12th district of Minhou County, formerly known as the Dahu District, is located west of the county seat, more than 120 li from the provincial capital, bordering the three counties of Gutian, Luoyuan, and Minqing. The entire district governs more than one hundred villages and is the largest district in Minhou County. In the past, during the Qing Dynasty, there was a county magistrate; in the Republic of China, there was a county assistant. After the Kuomintang came to power, a public security sub-bureau was established, which was recently changed to a district office. The area is characterized by steep mountains, barren soil, impoverished people, and fierce customs. The only products are rice, sweet potatoes, timber, and bamboo. Rice and paddy are only harvested once a year, with planting beginning in late spring and ripening in early autumn. At the beginning of this year, the authorities, seeing that bandits were rampant and opium seedlings were everywhere, making it impossible to carry out any baojia, clean-up campaigns, road construction, or education, specially dispatched Huang Kaiyuan's battalion of the 4th Regiment of the Military Police to the district in early February to eradicate opium seedlings and suppress bandits. After more than a month, the opium seedlings were removed, and more than one hundred bandits surrendered. Local order was restored, and the district office began to organize the baojia, which was completed in late March. Chen Shihong, the magistrate of Minhou County, accompanied by Shen Faza, the brigade commander of the 87th Division, went to inspect and summoned the village elders and bao heads at the Dahu District Office to talk and decided to hold two events: (1) to brand and register civilian guns and organize them into a militia team for self-defense. All villagers from 21 to 45 years old must be conscripted for training. (2) To build two highways, one from Dahu to Daping and one from Damu to Xikou, stipulating that every bao of one hundred households must build one hundred paces, and the district chief, Ma Longxiang, would guarantee that bandit leaders Lin Huaiqing and Chen Lutian would surrender their weapons. After the meeting, County Magistrate Chen and Brigade Commander Shen returned to the province, leaving a battalion of troops in Dahu to help District Chief Ma carry out the branding and registration of civilian guns, organize the militia team, and conscript laborers to build the highway. However, in the past month, only more than 500 civilian guns have been branded and registered (there are more than 1,500 civilian guns in the entire district), and the rest refuse to surrender them. They are even more reluctant to work on the highway construction and are watching each other and refusing to work. The bandit leader Lin Huaiqing, who had requested to surrender, also took the opportunity to incite the people, organize the Maitreya Society, and resist the army. The ignorant people were deceived into joining, reaching more than a thousand people, gathering around Xiayang. At the same time, Lin also colluded with five or six hundred members of the Big Sword Society from Minqing to invade the vicinity of Dahu in order to provide support and plan to surround and seize the weapons of the garrisoned troops. Fortunately, the Third Brigade of the Security Team discovered this and defeated the Big Sword Society first. The Maitreya Society, seeing that they were isolated, began to disintegrate and dared not invade Dahu from Xiayang. However, District Chief Ma Longxiang, at the beginning of the incident, fled back to the provincial capital from Dahu. The county government and Brigade Commander Shen believed that Lin Huaiqing had been guaranteed to surrender, yet he dared to incite the people to rebel. Moreover, he was unable to control the local situation and fled to the provincial capital, which was very wrong. A team was dispatched to search his residence for him but was unsuccessful. Lin Fang was appointed as the new district chief, and he arrived in Hu the day before yesterday to take office. According to reports, after the Maitreya Society was dissolved, the area has gradually calmed down. However, the construction of the highway and the organization of the militia team will probably have to be postponed until after the autumn harvest because the farming season is very busy. (8th)</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government Handles Inspection of Opium Seedlings in Northern Jiangsu, Sending Personnel to Cooperate with Administrative Commissioners</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang News: The Jiangsu Provincial Government previously received a telegram from Chairman Chiang strictly prohibiting the planting of opium seedlings, ordering all counties to print and provide guarantees, stating that if opium seedlings were found, they would be willing to be executed. All counties were notified to comply, and reports were subsequently received from 52 counties, including Danyang, stating that opium seedlings in their borders had been completely eradicated. In order to implement a general inspection of opium seedlings in the counties north of the Yangtze River, the Provincial Government's Department of Civil Affairs and the Security Department specifically appointed Ning Paibo, Jin Zhangguo, Wei Zhiqi, Chao Mei, Cao Minghuan, Luo Ailin, Zuo Qiwu, Wang Guobin, Chang Hefeng, Lin Jicheng, Liang Changcai, and Qin Hanchu, a total of twelve personnel, to go to the four districts of Yancheng, Huaiyin, Donghai, and Tongshan to cooperate with the respective administrative commissioners in handling the general inspection of planting opium. At the same time, the respective district commissioners were instructed to strictly implement the measures promulgated and report the actual situation of the inspection and the performance of the counties under their jurisdiction in prohibiting planting, listing the details in a detailed table and adding a comment, together with the general inspection report form, to be submitted for review and forwarding. The main points of the table are as follows: (1) The household name should verify the head of the household; (2) The address where opium seedlings are found should fill in the district, bao, village, and the four boundaries of the opium planting location; (3) The situation of eradication should fill in the opium seedlings, which were uprooted on the spot and the condition of the destroyed opium seedlings; (4) Whether the province and county have sent personnel to investigate, the investigation committee members should be noted separately; (5) Whether the local area has received donations, the names of the people who sponsored the collection of donations and protected the opium planting and the amount of the donations should be noted separately; (6) The course of the case or the names of the household heads, village heads, bao heads, district chiefs, and personnel at all levels in the case and the measures taken for their punishment should be filled in briefly.</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Sub-Bureau Chief Convicted of Accepting Bribes</h3>
<p>Since this county strictly prohibited opium, the county government ordered the Public Security Bureau to order all sub-bureaus and outposts to strictly investigate and arrest. However, Li Zehuan, the chief of the first sub-bureau in Tinglin, arrested a morphine trafficker and privately released him after receiving a bribe. The case was reported and discovered by the Third District Party Department. The county dispatched a water patrol team leader to arrest Li in Suzhou and escort him to Songjiang, where he was transferred to the court. After repeated investigations and interrogations, a public prosecution was filed. Today (10th), Li Zehuan was sentenced to five years of imprisonment for dereliction of duty, and Tao Huimin, who concealed the defendant's evidence, was sentenced to two months of imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Jinshan: Fifth Joint Sports Meet Closes</h3>
<p>The Fifth County's Joint Sports Meet for Primary and Secondary Schools and the Public's Amateur Sports Meet opened on the 6th of this month in the Public Sports Ground amidst the melodious sound of military music. County Magistrate Da Tingren served as the chairman, Bureau Chief Zhu Shijun served as the vice-chairman, Xi Chang served as the general secretary, and sports figures Rong Qizhao and Wang Fudan were hired as chief referees. At 8 a.m. that morning, the opening ceremony was held, with the participation of twenty schools and more than a thousand spectators. After the formalities, the chairman, vice-chairman, and representatives from the county party department gave speeches. After the military exercises, the competition began. In the morning, there were group exercises from various schools. At 1 p.m., the track and field competition began. The competition continued on the 7th until the curtain closed at 4 p.m. As a result, many county records were broken in various events. The first place in the primary school group was Zhu Jing Central School.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Wuxi Chamber of Commerce Seeks Members' Opinions on Bankruptcy Law</h3>
<p>The Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the Civil Law Committee of the Legislative Yuan issuing the first draft of the Bankruptcy Law and soliciting opinions, which were due by the 10th of this month. Therefore, the original letter was printed and distributed to members of various industries to solicit opinions separately. According to the written statement from the Cotton Textile Industry Association, regarding Article 1 of the general provisions of the draft, allowing conciliation or bankruptcy proceedings to begin if debts cannot be cleared, although Item (1) of the general explanation recognizes that bankruptcy is the clearing method commonly used in various countries for debtors who cannot clear their debts, China's various registration systems are incomplete, and people are more treacherous than in Western countries. Therefore, in addition to the creditor's expression of consent, the commencement of conciliation or bankruptcy should be determined by a civil procedure judgment. Only when there is no result after enforcement can the debtor be allowed to apply for conciliation or bankruptcy in accordance with the Bankruptcy Law, which can correct the general fraud in society and provide considerable protection to creditors. The application for restoration of rights only requires that no illegal facts are discovered within two years after the end of bankruptcy. In the past, many debtors who went bankrupt became rich again after only a few years, because they were good at concealing their assets at the time, and in a blink of an eye, the property was still under their control. This kind of bad habit is everywhere in society. Therefore, the commencement of bankruptcy and the time limit for the restoration of rights should be carefully considered again. A meeting of various industries was convened on the 6th to study the matter in detail, and all opinions were telegraphed to the Civil Law Committee of the Legislative Yuan for adoption and implementation.</p>
<h3>Security Team Squad Leader Training Graduates</h3>
<p>Mr. Bo Zhujun, the supervising officer of the Security Team in the Second District of Jiangsu Province, in order to improve the basic work of the Security Team, specifically held a squad leader training class at the Loyalty Temple in Huishan in August of last year. The first class of students has graduated and been assigned to various counties, with considerable success. The second class of students has been training since January of this year and, after four months, has reached its expiration date. A graduation ceremony was held yesterday, with a total of 147 students, 127 of whom graduated. Xiang Zhizhuang, the director of the Provincial Security Department, sent Peng, the section chief of the personnel section, to Wuxi to give instructions.</p>
<h3>Water Police Crack Double River Robbery Case</h3>
<p>The bamboo-selling boat of Yongsheng Shuhang, which was moored in front of the Wuqiao Bridge outside the North Gate on the Qianhe River, was boarded by four bandits on the evening of the 7th and robbed to Shuanghebang, with a loss of more than 500 yuan. Afterwards, Yan Heling, the captain of the Ninth Team of the Second District of the Waterborne Provincial Public Security Team stationed in the Fudian Temple in Huangbudun, ordered Inspector Xiang and others to strictly investigate and arrest. The bandits Wang Laosi, Wang Wei, and four men, women, and children were arrested in the grass shed of Tianda Bridge west of Wuqiao, and the stolen goods, silk, cloth, and clothing, totaling 78 pieces, a bandit boat, were found.

<h3>Key Suspect in Poison Pill Case's House Sealed</h3>
<p>After Wang Guiqing, the main suspect in the production of Maren brand poison pills, was arrested in Shanghai, he was escorted to Wuxi, and his accomplice, Su Guoliang, was also arrested and escorted to the county government. Yu Fenfen, the chief of the First Section, held a court session for interrogation. According to Su Guoliang, he did not admit to being a shareholder with Wang Guiqing in the production of poison pills, and said that he had never met Wang. In the second interrogation, Wang Guiqing confessed that in October of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, he and Su Guoliang, Chen Shaokun, and three others jointly manufactured Maren brand poison pills, producing 100,000 pills every two days. The sales area was limited to Wuxi. Hu Qiu, who had already been arrested, was just a worker and had nothing to do with the case. He pleaded for Hu's immediate release to avoid wrongly implicating an innocent person. After investigation, Wang Guiqing was ordered to be shackled, and Su Guoliang was detained. Ding Zijian, another accomplice, was also searched by inspectors Ge Xinde and others at Ding's residence at No. 20 Changda Building, Dawang Temple Lane, in the city. Ding had already fled upon hearing the news, so his house was temporarily sealed. Su Guoliang's residence was also sealed by personnel from the Public Security Bureau. Meanwhile, the detectives went to various places to track down the related criminals and bring them to justice for punishment.</p>

However, the two brothers were violent by nature. At about 6 p.m. the other night, a beggar, about fifteen or sixteen years old, came to A Lian's teahouse to ask for some hot water. A Lian refused and scolded him. Qian Genbao (26 years old), a tea customer, came forward to persuade him. A Lian, without asking the reason, punched and kicked Genbao and the beggar. Genbao, being weaker, fled to the southern embankment of Xie Dai Bridge and was punched again, falling to the river beach, where his head hit a bluestone, his brains burst, and he died. The murderer, knowing that he had committed a crime, fled without a trace. Teng Heting, the head of the village, reported to the nearby Public Security Outpost and reported to the local branch in the city, requesting an autopsy.</p>

<h3>Haimen The Mysterious Death of a Young Girl</h3>
<p>Yuan Zongxiu, a villager near Hefu in the Fourth District, married Shi, who gave birth to a daughter named Wangou. She is now fourteen years old and betrothed to the son of Huang Zhikang. Shi died of illness the year before last. Yuan remarried a daughter of the Li family as his stepmother. Li was naturally fierce and saw Wangou as a thorn in her side. She would whip her at the slightest displeasure. Wangou was afraid of her power and dared not speak out, only swallowing her sorrow and weeping silently. Wangou suddenly disappeared on the fourth of this month. Yuan searched everywhere, but there was no trace of her. It was not until the day before yesterday that Wangou's body was found in the ditch west of the house. Zhikang learned that Wangou had suddenly died and that the circumstances were suspicious. Yesterday, he had already asked the county government to investigate.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan Poor Silkworm Season Leads to Plummeting Mulberry Leaf Prices</h3>
<p>The weather in Xiaoshan this year has been uneven, with alternating cold and warm spells. Most of the silkworms raised by the sericultural farmers in the four townships have died of stiff disease. The eastern townships, which are the producing areas for [unclear character], still have hope for about 60% of the improved breed. The rest are completely hopeless. Now that the Beginning of Summer solar term has passed, most of the large sleeping silkworms have stopped eating mulberry leaves. Therefore, before the Beginning of Summer, the price of leaves was 1.2 yuan per picul, but after the solar term, it plummeted to 8 jiao per picul. Yesterday and today, it has dropped sharply to 2 jiao or 3 jiao per picul. Such a low leaf price is unprecedented in recent decades.</p>

<h3>Minister Kong Arrives in Shanghai to Discuss Reduction of Transit and Other Taxes</h3>
<p>If it is not implemented by June, it will be extended to July; the Start Date for the Stock Exchange Tax Has Not Yet Been Determined</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Kong Xiangxi, the Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, took the night train from Nanjing to Shanghai the night before last and arrived at Zhenru at 7:10 AM yesterday. He went directly to his private residence on West Ainsworth Road to rest. He then went to the Shanghai Sanatorium on Hongqiao Road around 9:00 AM to visit Song Zi'an. Afterward, he went to the Central Bank on the Bund to handle important official business and met with reporters. According to Kong, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek recently noted that there were many shoals and reefs in the Sichuan River, which hindered travel. Therefore, he especially instructed to intensify the bombing to destroy them. However, there are too many shoals and reefs in the Sichuan River, and the bombing project is very large. It is necessary to send personnel to investigate first. Only after the investigation is completed can the bombing begin, so that the obstacles in Sichuan can be removed as soon as possible, which will facilitate travel. The report on the International Exchange Bank Regulations refers to the international convention signed last year. In the past, banks in various countries always suspended international savings payments and prohibited cash exports when wars occurred. Now, after the implementation of these regulations, the above-mentioned currency problems can be avoided. The date on which the stock exchange tax will be levied has not yet been determined. If the abolition of transit tax and reduction of export tax cannot be implemented on June 1, it will be postponed to July 1.</p>

<h3>National Products Manufacturers Association Holds Annual Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Lin Kanghou and 25 Others Elected as Executive Committee Members; Hu Xiyuan and 11 Others Elected as Supervisory Committee Members</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese National Products Manufacturers Association held its fifth annual meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday at the Shanghai National Products Movement Relief Conference at the Penglai Market in Xiaoximen to elect executive and supervisory committee members and discuss nine proposals. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Delegates Present</p>
<p>The delegates present at yesterday's meeting included Lin Kanghou from the Meilong Alcohol Factory, Sun Xinzhu from the Dingxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Xu Xiaochu from the Sino-French Pharmacy, Liang Bozhi from the Liangxinji Toothbrush Factory, Chen Xianben from the China United Wool Weaving Factory, Qian Zongjian from the Jiuxin Enamel Factory, Le Fucheng from the Taikang Food Company, Tang Hezhong from the Minsheng Rubber Factory, Fu Fengxiang from the Chuanfengji Machine-Made Knitting Factory, Xu Jutang from the China Only Camel Wool Factory, and Wang Hanqiang and Liu Zhongying from the previous executive committee, as well as more than 200 members from the Minhua Umbrella Factory, Hefeng Socks Factory, Yabaoer Electric Appliance Factory, Mei Yagang Factory, and Wuzhou Pharmacy.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>The meeting began at 10:30 AM. Lin Kanghou, Chen Jicheng, Sun Xinzhu, Wang Hanqiang, and Liu Zhongying were elected as the presidium of the conference, with Xu Chengde and Liu Tao as recorders and Ge Furi as master of ceremonies. After the formal proceedings, Chairman Liu Zhongying reported briefly that the association was established in the 19th year of the Republic. When the January 28th Incident occurred in Shanghai, the association's location was in the war zone. Amid the chaos and terror in Shanghai, there was no time to relocate, and the association's premises were completely destroyed, and documents were lost. Therefore, the association's activities were suspended. Although it has been six years since its establishment, it has only been five years in practice. The motivation for its establishment was in the 19th year of the Republic when Mr. Zhang Zilian from the national products industry held the China National Products United Department Store at the original site of the Nanjing Road Municipal Government. The department store was unreasonably obstructed and forced to stop by the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement on the pretext of incomplete equipment and various violations of the settlement regulations. They even dispatched a large number of detectives armed with guns to forcibly seal off the department store. Their intention was entirely to undermine our people's national products movement. Therefore, all the manufacturers participating in the department store felt that the insult from imperialism to the Chinese people was extremely harsh. Aroused by public indignation, they united and formed the association. Liu Zhongying, lacking talent, was elected as an executive committee member of the association for the past five years, thanks to the love of all the members and manufacturers. Fortunately, he has been able to avoid mistakes with the enthusiastic support of all the committee members and members. However, the national crisis is not over, the market situation is deteriorating, and the annual trade deficit continues to rise unabated. The development of the national products industry remains sluggish and without revival. This requires the continued efforts and struggles of our national products organizations. He hoped that the members would continue to supervise and support the association's future work in order to achieve the ultimate victory of our national products industry. Finally, he stated that the association's work in the past years is detailed in the association's fifth anniversary publication, and he asked everyone to read it carefully.</p>
<p>Discussion of Proposals</p>
<p>There were a total of nine proposals at yesterday's meeting, including the following that were passed: (1) Requesting the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance to effectively assist industry and commerce; (2) Requesting the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance to exempt national products from transit tax; (3) Requesting the Ministry of Finance to exempt domestic national cotton thread from business tax; (4) Holding a Jiangyin National Products Exhibition, leaving it to the executive committee to handle; (1) Preparing for the establishment of a National Products Sample Exhibition Hall; (2) Producing national products films; (3) Preparing to build a national products broadcasting station; (4) Holding a national commodities exhibition; (5) Organizing a national products propaganda team.</p>
<p>List of Elected Members</p>
<p>A total of 178 ballots were cast at yesterday's meeting (including three invalid ballots). The votes were counted in four groups, and the results were announced. The list is as follows: Lin Kanghou, Liu Zhongying, Chen Binghui, Le Fucheng, Wang Hanqiang, Xu Jutang, Xu Xiaochu, Zhu Gengtao, Chen Jicheng, Xue Fuji, Xu Yunhui, Sun Xinzhu, Tang Hezhong, Tao Leqin, Qian Zongjian, Huang Shicun, Shao Daren, Liang Bozhi, Lu Dexin, Chen Jiqing, Chen Youyun, Fu Fengxiang, Xu Guojun, Pan Dechun, and Chen Xianben were elected as executive committee members. Hu Xiyuan, Gao Shiheng, Wang Yansong, Yao Defu, Liang Gengshun, Zhang Zilian, Li Zufan, Xiang Longxun, Yang Weiyin, Xu Jianruo, and Liang Cida were elected as supervisory committee members.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Seeks Information on Illegally Established Wireless Radio Stations</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Ministry of Communications has recently received reports from various sources stating that wireless radio stations are being illegally established in various places to send and receive telegrams. This illegal action not only undermines China's radio administration but also hinders public security. A public notice has been issued offering rewards for secret reports in the hope of uncovering these stations. The text of the Ministry of Communications' public notice is as follows: "Recently, it has been discovered that unscrupulous people in various places are privately establishing wireless radio stations for secret communication, which not only undermines the state-run telecommunications industry but also hinders public security and violates criminal law. The Ministry has repeatedly taken strict measures to ban and investigate such cases. However, private radio stations are often secretive and difficult to detect completely. Therefore, we are offering rewards for secret reports. Anyone who can detect the location of a private radio station and secretly report it to the local telegraph office or the Department of Radio Administration of the Ministry of Communications in Nanjing, leading to the discovery of a transmitting machine, will be rewarded with 300 yuan. For discovering a receiving machine, the reward will be 100 yuan. For particularly serious cases, the reward may be increased. Secret reports should be sealed and sent directly to the local telegraph office or the Department of Radio Administration of the Ministry of Communications. The Ministry will absolutely keep the identity of the informant confidential."</p>

<h3>The National Economic Council Plans to Build a Cotton Industry Experiment Hall</h3>
<p>In order to thoroughly improve our country's cotton industry, the Cotton Control Committee of the National Economic Council has planned to build a Cotton Industry Experiment Hall in western Shanghai, investing 100,000 yuan to equip it with a factory-scale engineering facility for cotton picking and cotton making in order to conduct in-depth research and make fundamental improvements. It has already purchased high-quality cotton seeds in the United States and distributed them for planting. The reason why our country's cotton yarn industry is not prosperous is due to high costs and poor cotton seeds. The planned experiment hall will conduct precise and systematic research based on this purpose. It is heard that the architectural drawings of the hall have been reviewed and approved by the committee and will be issued for bidding and construction in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Suppressing the Arbitrary Bankruptcy of Money Shops: Ministry of Finance Orders Promulgation of Regulatory Laws</h3>
<p>Principles Already Drafted by the Currency Department</p>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports that Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi, in light of the fact that several money shops and silver firms have closed down one after another since the silver crisis, citing financial difficulties and greatly impacting the market, and that the biggest reason for their closure is that nine out of ten cases involve private investment in speculative ventures that resulted in losses, rather than operational losses, previously made a public statement that if similar situations continue to occur in the future, strict measures will be taken. At the same time, the Ministry of Finance instructed the money industry association to investigate and report the number of money shops that have closed down and the reasons for their closure. The money industry association immediately complied and submitted a detailed investigation report to the Ministry of Finance. It is now known that the Ministry of Finance considers these money shops to be unlimited liability companies, bearing absolute responsibility to depositors and creditors, and to prevent similar incidents from happening again, intends to establish a separate regulatory law. From now on, if a money shop closes down, it cannot simply cease operations and abandon its debt responsibilities to depositors and creditors. The principles have already been ordered to be drafted by the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3>Rong Zongjing to Conduct Press Corps Today</h3>

<h3>General Chamber of Industry Petitions Ministry of Industry and Commerce to Intervene in Revising Sino-Foreign Trade Contracts</h3>
<p>The All-China General Federation of Industry, based on a proposal from its Qingdao branch, believes that Chinese merchants are often bound by the unilateral contracts of Western merchants in their trade dealings, suffering greatly from oppression. It plans to jointly negotiate with other industrial and commercial groups and foreign chambers of commerce. Yesterday, it also submitted a petition to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce requesting relief. The original petition stated: "Regarding the petition for intervention in the revision of Sino-foreign trade contract methods, we implore your kind review. According to the Qingdao branch's petition, the principle of international trade and commerce in all countries has always been based on equality and mutual benefit, so that the people of both countries can enjoy the same treatment under this principle. However, China's situation is very different from that of other countries. Because the national strength is weak, Western merchants often print a unilateral contract in advance when Chinese merchants conclude contracts for the sale of goods with them. The conditions are harsh, and the text also stipulates that if there is a dispute, the English version shall prevail, etc., disregarding Chinese law and national dignity. Over the years, those who have suffered from this are countless. We implore your esteemed association to submit a report to the government on the situation and request relief, and at the same time, negotiate and strive with the Western chambers of commerce according to reason." The petition went on to say that this situation has been going on for a long time in commercial ports, and Chinese merchants are unconsciously subjected to the oppression of imperialism. Due to the weakness of the national strength, it is difficult to resist. The various points raised by the association have considerable insights from the standpoint of merchants and the standpoint of national legal rights, and should be vigorously contended for to change long-standing habits. For this reason, draft Sino-English contract methods and general rules for the purchase of materials, one item each, have been prepared and submitted to your ministry for review, for the purpose of revision. After being returned, it will be jointly negotiated with other industrial and commercial groups and foreign chambers of commerce. We also request your ministry to consult with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the consuls in various regions to discuss how to revise the measures. We await instructions for compliance, as it is in the public interest. Respectfully submitted to Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry and Commerce Hires Yu Qiaqing and Others as Review Committee for the National Goods Hall Spring Exhibition</h3>
<p>Yu Qiaqing, Yu Zuoting, Wu Tingsheng, and others received a letter yesterday from Minister Chen Gongbo of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, stating: "Regarding the National Goods Exhibition Hall of this ministry holding the Spring National Goods Exhibition of this year, it has been approved for record-keeping. According to the hall's report, this exhibition has already opened on the 1st of this month, with no less than several thousand kinds of products arriving. In accordance with the provisions of Article 12 of the hall's regulations, the exhibits should be reviewed during the exhibition period, and awards should be given for excellence. We hereby propose a list of committee members for reviewing the exhibits and request your review and approval to appoint them separately, and designate the chairman of the committee to facilitate the organization of the exhibition review committee and the review of the exhibits, etc." In addition to already ordering the directors of the Ministry, Liang Shangdong, and others to be members of the exhibition review committee, and instructing the hall to convene meetings on a regular basis, We have long admired your profound knowledge, rich experience, and enthusiasm for promoting national goods, and specially appoint you as a member of the exhibition review committee for the Spring National Goods Exhibition of this year at the National Goods Exhibition Hall of this Ministry. We hereby request that you take note of this.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce of Shanghai Telegraphed the Ministries of Finance and Industry to Allow Fishing Boats to Engage in Coastal Trade Concurrently</h3>
<p>Requesting Modification of Regulations for Coastal Merchant Ships to Rescue the Collapse of Coastal Fishing Industry</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministries of Finance and Industry yesterday to request a modification of the regulations to allow fishing boats to engage in coastal trade concurrently. The telegram stated: "Regarding the matter reported on the 9th of this month by the Wusong sub-office of our association, based on a joint letter from Baofeng, Cui Sheng, Shen Tai, and other fish firms, regarding fishing boats being fined, affecting the city's appearance, requesting relief and forwarding the letter to the Customs for consideration to maintain commerce. The Northern Yellow Croaker is the most prosperous business period in Wusong in the spring. This year, upon the arrival of the first boats, the Customs immediately imposed fines for violating the new regulations. Upon hearing this news, the boat merchants will all switch to other ports, causing Wusong to appear reduced in size, and as a result, the market has suffered a great setback. Therefore, we briefly explain the principles and difficulties stated by the fishing boats as follows: Although Article 16 of the new Customs regulations is simply stated, if merchant ships engaged in maritime trade are converted to fishing operations, they should submit the licenses they have received to the Customs for inspection, and the Customs should note in the ship's registration book that it has been converted to fishing operations and is not allowed to engage in trade again. However, according to the facts, this is impossible. Before the fishing season, merchant ships still carry a lot of passengers and goods, so they had planned to apply for a statement of their intention to fish after unloading the goods when applying for cargo export, but the Customs did not facilitate this because there was still cargo on board. When it was time to unload southern goods in the north, it was again the fishing season, and they were afraid that they would not be able to catch up with the net casting and salt dropping, and they really had no time to go to the Customs to complete the registration procedures, only holding the Customs book and asking local authorities, such as the district office, chamber of commerce, and public security bureau, to affix a seal to prove it. Unexpectedly, when they fished to Wusong, the Customs still imposed a fine of 25 yuan per boat. The merchant ships are invaded and seized by foreign ships, threatened by bandits, and fined by the Customs. At this time, the merchant ships are too restricted. Can we ask your chamber of commerce to send a letter to the Customs for consideration, otherwise, after the next fishing season, they will have to go to Qiya, Hupu, and other non-port areas to ensure safety and barely make a living? We have investigated that the ships that catch Northern Ocean fish are completely兼業 in nature, not purely fishing boats. Moreover, the fishing season is too short, and the registration of the registration book is a new regulation. Considering their difficulties, it seems that we can learn the original situation. And the government's decrees are repeatedly issued to maintain the fishing industry and revitalize domestic products. Merchants, etc., believe that this kind of fish is a food for agricultural work, and Wusong is a gathering area for both buying and selling. At this time of market depression, if fishing boats do not arrive, farmers will inevitably seek other sources, and then the entire commercial decline of Wusong Town will be unimaginable. For this reason, we ask your association to forward the application to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and request the Shanghai Customs Superintendent and Tax Affairs Department to show consideration and quickly instruct the Wusong sub-Customs to consider those fishing merchant ships whose registration books have been officially sealed by local authorities, and to exempt them from fines in view of the initial establishment of the new regulations, in order to maintain the fishing industry, etc. According to this, the Wusong yellow croaker fishing season is the most prosperous period for the business of each store in this area, and it is related to the annual profit and loss. Now that the Jianghai Customs has promulgated new regulations, the fishing boats are unfamiliar with them, resulting in fines, and they are all bound to stop. The commercial impact is greatly affected, and the claims of the companies are indeed real. Accordingly, we hereby forward the letter to your association, asking you to forward it to the Jianghai Customs for negotiation to exempt them from fines, in order to maintain the fishing industry and care for the difficulties of merchants, and to the utmost of public friendship, etc. Arrived at the meeting, we investigated that our country's coastal fishing boats have seasons for fishing, which is commonly called the fishing season. Therefore, the fishing time is very short in all four seasons of the year. During the period when they are not fishing, they are all engaged in the loading and transportation of coastal goods. This kind of兼業 has been going on for a long time, and it has slightly adjusted the livelihood of fishing boats, and there is no loss to public taxes. Now, according to the provisions of Article 16 of the revised regulations on the management of coastal merchant ships promulgated by the Ministry, after engaging in fishing operations, they are not allowed to engage in trade again, and those who violate this will be fined with the confiscation of ships and goods for official use. Then, after the fishing season is over, they will inevitably sit and eat for a long time, with no income at all. How can they bear it? At this time when the coastal fishing industry is on the verge of collapse, how can there be such a self-binding act? Therefore, this matter is not a question of exemption from Customs fines, but a question of the revision of the regulations. Your ministry is in charge of the fishing industry, and is concerned about the livelihood of coastal fishermen. If you do not consult with them in detail and ask them to revise the regulations, there will be no chance of reviving the fishing industry that is about to be cut off. Therefore, we hereby telegraph your ministry to request your review and approval, and to consult and revise the regulations so that fishing boats can still have the right to engage in cargo transportation concurrently, in order to maintain their dying livelihoods. It is truly in the public interest. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce respectfully, good."</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed the Ministry of Railways, Requesting the Two Railway Bureaus to Rectify Freight Transport</h3>
<p>Goods Constantly Piled Up in the Open Air at the Railway Station; Too Few Vehicles, Often Delayed for a Long Time</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Railways yesterday, stating: "Respectfully to the Nanjing Ministry of Railways, on the 9th of this month, according to a joint letter from the silk and satin industry, knitting industry, enamel industry, sauce and wine industry, homespun industry, fruit and earth product industry, bean and rice industry, burlap bag industry, porcelain industry, seafood grocery industry, rice shop industry, miscellaneous grain and oil cake industry, electrical silk weaving factory industry, national rubber product industry, and refining industry associations of this city: We, the association, have repeatedly heard from our members that in the business operated by the merchants, the production and sales of goods from various places all depend on rapid transportation to meet the needs of the people's livelihood and to adjust the prosperity of the commercial market. However, today, the transportation of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways is not only not fast, but also often delayed. The reason is that the cargo warehouses at the stations in this city are too small, and there are too few workers and staff, so that the goods arrive at the station and are mostly piled up in the open air, exposed to rain and moisture, and no one cares. Sometimes there is a lack of vehicles, and the goods are backlogged for a minimum of six or seven days, and a maximum of more than ten days. Shanghai is the commercial hub of the country, and the railway is a state-owned enterprise. It should be planned carefully and equipped completely to seek the convenience of merchants and people. Now it is the opposite, and it is inevitable that it runs counter to the Principle of the People's Livelihood. For this reason, we request that you send a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council, and present it to the Ministry of Railways to request relief, in order to maintain business and relieve the merchants of Jiangsu." According to this, the various points mentioned by the merchants are indeed true. Accordingly, we hereby send a letter to your association, asking you to quickly forward it to the Ministry of Railways for review, and to order the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration to thoroughly rectify the matter, so as to facilitate freight transport and ensure commercial peace. It is truly in the public interest, etc. Arrived at the meeting, we investigated that the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways are the most prosperous areas in the country. Recently, since the implementation of intermodal transport by land and water on various routes, the collection and distribution of goods is greater than before. The cargo warehouses of the two railways are too small, and there are too few staff members, so that the goods arriving at the station are often piled up in the open air, exposed to moisture and damage, and delayed for as long as a week or half a month due to too few vehicles. Since the various industry associations have filed a complaint, it must be true. Railway business is mainly freight transport, and freight transport is especially responsible for speed and promptness. According to the previous situation in the letter, we should telegraph your ministry for review, and inform the two railway bureaus to rectify and improve the above-mentioned shortcomings one by one, in order to facilitate commercial transport. It is truly in the public interest. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce respectfully, good."</p>

<h3>League of Nations to Aid White Russian Women; Relief Organization to Be Established in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that White Russian women in China, forced by livelihood, have become prostitutes, and are now gradually increasing. Yu, a member of the Committee on the Problem of Trafficking in Women and Children of the League of Nations, is paying serious attention to this and will provide relief. According to reporters, although there are no accurate statistics on the number of White Russians in China, it is estimated that there are about 60,000, of which women account for about one-third, reaching about 20,000. Most of these White Russians who have fled to our country are plagued by livelihood, and even men have become beggars, and women have become prostitutes to make a living. The places where they are more concentrated are the three northeastern provinces and Tianjin and Shanghai. In recent years, the lives of these White Russians (men) in China have gradually made new progress, because some foreign factories have already recruited White Russians to replace Chinese workers, but women are still trapped in abject poverty and have no way to make a living. Many of them still use their flesh to sell laughter for a living. Taking Shanghai as an example, due to the lack of scattered organizations to inquire about, it is estimated that there are about 1,000 to 2,000 people. These women all live in the Hongkou and Avenue Joffre and Rue Pere Robert areas. Every time the sun sets, one can always see these foreign prostitutes, heavily made up, walking on Avenue Joffre, seeking masters to maintain their lives. Their actions are despicable, but their situation is pitiable. Now, in order to provide relief to these women, the Committee on the Problem of Trafficking in Women and Children of the League of Nations will establish relief organizations in Tianjin, Shanghai, and the three northeastern provinces. In cities such as Tianjin and Shanghai, many parasites can be removed.</p>

<h3>Municipal Government Forbids Users to Confront Electrical Enterprises</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government issued a notice yesterday, stating: "Regarding the letter No. 231 from the Construction Committee, stating: Electrical enterprises are important modern public utilities, and their relationship with the local people, industrial and commercial operators is deep and significant. The central competent authority has specially formulated various regulations and laws for electrical enterprises, which have been submitted to and approved by the National Government, and promulgated for the common observance of electrical enterprises and local people, and to facilitate the supervision of local governments. However, in recent years, when local people have disputes or are dissatisfied with the local power plant, they often organize a user association to confront them, using the name of the local group to expand the dispute day by day, or even threaten not to pay electricity bills, which greatly hinders the future of public utilities and violates the regulations promulgated by the central government. Article 14 of the Regulations for the Supervision of Private Public Utilities stipulates that if a private public utility is poorly managed, hindering the interests of users or endangering social security, upon the complaint of the people, and after the verification of a specialist technician, the local supervisory authority may submit a report to the central competent authority and order it to improve within a time limit. Therefore, when electrical users believe that the local power plant is poorly managed, they should follow the proper channels, list the facts, list the names of the users, and submit a report to the local government, adding handling opinions, and submitting it to this committee for approval, ordering improvement within a time limit. If there are any other organizations that organize user associations under the name of or similar to other similar names, they should be strictly prohibited in order to benefit the public and respect the law. In addition to issuing letters to the relevant bureaus, we hereby issue a notice to inform all citizens of the city. This is the notice."</p>

<h3>Zhengfeng Middle School Girl Student Disappearance Dispute: Is It Abduction by Classmates, Already in Court? One Theory: Suicide by Drowning Due to Failing Exams</h3>
<p>Chen Shaoan, a 64-year-old from Haimen residing at No. 40, Lane 233, Route des Soeurs in the French Concession, has a daughter named Chen Pinqing, who is of marriageable age and a third-year junior high school student at Zhengfeng Middle School on Rue du Pere Huc. She suddenly disappeared on the morning of the 17th of last month at 11:00 AM. After searching without success, it was discovered that she had been in</p>
<p>collusion and lured away</p>
<p>by her female classmate Huang Huizhen, who has returned to Huangcang Town in Qidong, and female classmate Lu Ruoyun from Zhejiang, residing at No. 4, Lane 179, Rue du Pere Huc, as well as male classmate Wang Dingyi from Kunshan, and Lu's brother, Lu Ying. He has filed a lawsuit in the Second Special Court's Criminal Division, accusing Huang Huizhen, Wang Dingyi, Lu Ruoyun, Lu Ying, and others of disrupting his family and requesting punishment under Article 157 of the Criminal Code. According to the complaint, his daughter Pinqing was lured away by Lu Ruoyun at 11:00 AM on the 17th of this month and has not been seen since. After reporting to the police, there is still no news. The first defendant, Huang Huizhen, went to the home of the second defendant, Wang Dingyi. Lu Ruoyun often came to the second defendant's house to call for Pinqing. The first defendant suddenly returned home on the 15th, and the second defendant arranged for the girl to be sent to the ship. The next day, the second defendant again arranged for the girl to go to Wusong. There is a letter sent</p>
<p>from Wusong</p>
<p>to the first defendant on that day as proof. Moreover, there are three letters from the first defendant to the mother as proof. It is clear that the first defendant lured her away. The second and third defendants have always been friends and have corresponded frequently. On the day the daughter ran away, the third defendant went to the Lu residence five times, as witnessed by the maid and Xu Xunshi. When the fourth defendant, Lu Ying, was questioned, he said that they had been corresponding for more than a year, but the letters had been burned. Considering the circumstances, he is clearly a suspect. After the defendant ran away, the fourth defendant, Lu Ying, after the plaintiff</p>
<p>repeatedly investigated</p>
<p>then asked the third defendant and sent someone specifically to Qidong to question the first defendant. However, after returning from Qidong, his attitude suddenly changed, reversing his previous determination to investigate, as evidenced by a letter. Moreover, after questioning by the detectives, he still did not search. If there was no prior collusion, why would he act so differently before and after? As brother and sister, their feelings should be natural. How could he not pay attention to his weak sister's escape? The details are fragmented, and he requests a legal inquiry and the return of his daughter. Yesterday, based on the complaint, Judge Sun Pengxian questioned the defendants in the Second Criminal Court. First, the plaintiff, Chen Shaoan, described</p>
<p>his daughter's escape</p>
<p>and the defendants' collusion. The first and third defendants, Huang Huizhen and Lu Huayun, did not appear. The second and fourth defendants, Wang Dingyi and Lu Ying, arrived with their lawyers. According to Wang, he did not know the plaintiff's daughter's whereabouts and denied collusion. Lu Ying said that his sister Ruoyun had run away with the plaintiff's daughter and had not been found. Later, they received a letter saying that she had committed</p>
<p>suicide due to failing</p>
<p>the school's major exam. He asked someone to inquire at Huang Huizhen's house, but there was no news. He also asked Wang Dingyi, but there was no clue. The judge then instructed that the summons for Huang Huizhen should be entrusted to the Qidong County Government for delivery, but no reply had been received. The hearing was rescheduled for the 20th. However, it is rumored that Chen Pinqing and Lu Ruoyun committed suicide because they failed their exams and could not participate in the graduation exam. It is rumored that Lu Ruoyun drowned and her body has been found on the coast of Haimen. Her brother, Lu Ying, took a boat to Haimen yesterday to identify the body. Whether this is true remains to be confirmed.</p>
<h3>After the Recent Heatwave, the Weather Changed Drastically Again Yesterday</h3>

<p>The weather in this city was suddenly hot the day before yesterday, with the temperature rising to 94 degrees and the atmospheric pressure being very high. It was predicted that the weather would not change in the near future. Unexpectedly, at 11:00 AM yesterday, the weather suddenly changed again.

<h3>Alas, the Death of a Rickshaw Puller</h3>
<p>Fearing the Police Would Confiscate His License, He Fled in Panic and Was Run Over and Killed by a British Man's Car</p>
<p>Sun Quanzhao, a 25-year-old from Jiangbei residing at No. 56, Lijiazhai, Luban Road in the Nanshi Chinese district, made a living pulling a rickshaw. At 8:05 PM on the 8th, while soliciting business in front of No. 703 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, he saw patrol officers from the 79th unit approaching. Fearing that his license would be confiscated, Sun pulled the rickshaw in a panic, fleeing eastward to westward. At that moment, a private car with license plate number 11243, driven by a British resident named Gan Erde (transliteration), was traveling in the same direction from east to west. Unable to avoid each other, Sun was knocked down, sustaining head injuries and losing consciousness. The patrol officers recorded the car's license plate number and took Sun to the police station, from where he was sent to Guangci Hospital. Due to the severity of his injuries, he died at 11:30 PM that night. The hospital notified the police station, who transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for examination. Yesterday, a report was filed with the Second Special Court, and Chief Prosecutor Chen, along with forensic doctor Wei and clerk Peng, arrived at the hall at noon to examine the body. After examining the body, they sat in court and questioned the patrol officer who witnessed the incident. The defendant, the British man, did not appear. According to Wang Weigao, a relative of the deceased, the deceased had a mother and wife who were currently in the countryside. He was willing to claim the body for burial and requested justice. The judge ruled that Sun Quanzhao had indeed died from a head injury sustained after being hit by a car. The body was handed over to Wang Weigao for burial. The defendant, Gan Erde, should be held responsible, and the police department should investigate and consult with the relevant consulate for a fair trial.</p>
<h3>Fanliyuan, a Decade-Old Store, Suddenly Closed Down Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Affected by Gold Prices, Owes More Than 90,000 Yuan, Promissory Notes Cannot Be Paid, Lawyer Appointed for Liquidation</p>
<p>Fanliyuan Record, a woolen fabric and foreign goods store located at the intersection of Sichuan Road and Beijing Road, had been in business for more than a decade. Recently, affected by the decline in silver and gold prices and the sluggish market, it suddenly closed down yesterday morning. A lawyer was appointed to announce liquidation, with debts reaching more than 90,000 yuan. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Reasons for Closure</p>
<p>Fanliyuan Record, No. 512 Sichuan Road, a woolen fabric and foreign goods store, was solely owned by Yan Liekun and had been in business for more than a decade. It specialized in selling Western goods, with Westerners being its main customers. Its business was booming four years ago, with annual profits. In recent years, due to the sluggish social economy and the recent gradual rise in silver prices and the gradual fall in gold prices, each shipment of goods to Shanghai resulted in losses. Coupled with the extremely tight credit conditions in the city, its turnover became difficult, eventually leading to its inability to maintain operations. It closed down yesterday morning, owing approximately 90,000 yuan. However, its remaining goods were worth more than 60,000 yuan, and it was owed approximately 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Announcement of Liquidation</p>
<p>Recently, due to a large number of promissory notes being issued that could not be paid on time, and the inability to adjust and turn around, lawyer Chen Zhifan was appointed as the representative to announce liquidation. The liquidation notice is recorded below: 1. I, Chen Zhifan, hereby announce that Yan Liekun, the owner of Fanliyuan Record, No. 512 Sichuan Road, has declared that this store is unable to maintain operations due to poor business and has specially commissioned me to announce liquidation to bring it to an end. It is hereby urgently announced in the newspaper to all creditors that they should bring their certificates to this office for registration within fourteen days. All debtors are also required to pay their debts in full within the same period for distribution. Please do not hesitate and delay, or you will be mistaken. This notice.</p>
<h3>Police Raid Two Red Pill Dens</h3>
<p>Selling on Rue Rateau, Manufacturing on Route A. Joffre</p>
<p>Yang Peisheng, the Chinese detective of the Yulin Road Police Station, along with detectives Huang Wangfu and Xie Wanfang, learned that an old woman from Suzhou, Chen Wangshi, was secretly selling the poisonous drug red pills near Renshou Lane on Rue Rateau for profit. They sent an informant to act as a buyer and purchased 8,000 red pills for 56 yuan. They marked the banknotes and paid them on the afternoon of the previous day at 6:00 PM in the lane. At the appointed time and place, Chen and her son, Chen Baisheng, and Wang Erlang, an apprentice from Nanxiang, slowly arrived. The informant pointed out that the paper box Chen was carrying contained the potent red pills. The detectives rushed forward and arrested them. They opened the paper box and found 12 bags of red pills, and another four bags were found on Chen's waist, totaling 8,000 pills. They also confiscated a five-yuan banknote with the marked banknote. After questioning Chen, they learned that the manufacturing den was located upstairs at No. 23, Tongfa Lane, Route A. Joffre. They rushed to that location and arrested the young boss, Yang Zongyao, from Shaoxing. They found 51 yuan in marked banknotes on his person and a bag of poison pills in the rice jar, totaling 139 pills, as well as two sets of opium smoking paraphernalia and a large lead pot with a double bottom (used to hold the red pills for delivery to customers). However, there were no pill-making tools. The pills were made by hand. They also took his father, Yang Zishun, mother, Yang Gu, sister-in-law, Yang Liu, and relative Chen Gengsheng from Hangzhou into custody and detained them separately. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. 工部局 Lawyer Li Zhishan recounted the events and stated that Chen Wangshi had been an employee of the den for many years. Yang Zongyao admitted at the police station that he had purchased the poison pill ingredients from the pharmacy. The other defendants were likely involved in making the poison pills. Yang Liu admitted to smoking opium. He requested a postponement of the case for further investigation. The Chinese and Western detectives then reported the details of the case, presenting the evidence for inspection. The defendants' statements were evasive. Judge Wu Zehan ordered them to be remanded in custody separately, rescheduling the hearing for further investigation.</p>

<h3>Bathing Buddha Festival 香會 Ends Today</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the Bathing Buddha Festival. The热闹 scene at the Jing'an Temple 香會 in western Shanghai was unprecedented. Believers and devotees streamed in endlessly. The temple was filled with incense smoke, with hardly any space left. Businesses at the various stalls were particularly booming. Chinese and foreign police officers patrolled day and night. The stalls were required to move out completely by this afternoon, marking the end of the annual 香會.</p>
<h3>市 Gardening Field: The City Center Branch is Completed</h3>
<p>Since Field Manager Bao Bo Du took office at the 市 Gardening Field, he has worked hard to improve the field, gradually expanding its scope and enriching its content. Currently, the authorities are actively seeking to promote the prosperity of the city center area and have acquired a 60-acre site at the intersection of Huayuan Road and Qiujiang to establish a city center branch. Work began last winter and was largely completed in the spring. This year's Arbor Day ceremony was held at the branch. The entire field is decorated in a refined and magnificent style. Upon entering, one sees a flower bed, behind which is a lawn in the shape of an ancient mirror. The outer perimeter is undulating with hills and winding paths. Pines, cypresses, plums, and osmanthus trees are planted in different areas. Various specimen trees are distributed on both sides of the garden path, with red signs indicating their names and uses. At the foot of the mountain, there is a wide and deep lotus pond, spanned by a red-railed bridge. Looking down at the swimming fish is particularly interesting. To the east of the bridge is a built-in office, with a greenhouse in front. Further west, there is an oval flower bed. The surrounding area near the lotus pond is planted with weeping willows and cherry blossoms. Peach and willow trees are planted along the banks of the Qiujiang River. In the southwest corner, there are various garden trees. The entire field is full of mountains, clear waters, and appropriate arrangements. The winding paths and the different shades of green are refreshing and rejuvenating. The field has achieved such results with very little funding and in a very short period of time, which is not easy. Citizens who wish to purchase flowers and trees to decorate their gardens after their leisure have a place to inquire and consult, which is conducive to the development of the gardening industry.</p>

<h3>市 Zoo Pigeon Race: Winning Race Pigeons Evaluated</h3>
<p>89 Participated, Only 64 Returned to Shanghai: First Place Flew 894.2 Meters per Minute</p>
<p>The pigeon race organized by the 市 Zoo was held at Wuxi Station on the morning of the 9th. By 7:00 PM, 64 race pigeons had returned to Shanghai, with excellent results. The 申时 社 reporter will report on the details as follows:</p>
<p>89 Race Pigeons</p>
<p>Since the museum began accepting entries last month, 25 pigeon owners have registered, registering 145 race pigeons. However, on the 9th, only 20 owners actually arrived, with a total of 89 pigeons participating. Initially, the museum had originally planned to release the pigeons at Nanjing Xiaguan Station, but later, considering that the competition was still a trial, and to take into account the pigeons' abilities, it was changed to be released at Wuxi Station. The museum staff all traveled to 锡 by overnight train on the 8th to make preparations.</p>
<p>Appointed Judges, Pigeon Nest Records</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM on the 9th, 89 race pigeons were released at Wuxi Station, soaring into the sky at once, which was a spectacular sight. Ten minutes later, the flock of pigeons gradually disappeared into the eastern sky. The distance from 锡 to Zhabei, Shanghai, on the Jinghu Railway is 128.54 kilometers. However, because the distances from the pigeon nests to the owners' residences varied, the museum separately invited Zhou Shuwang of the 市 Party Headquarters, Cao Xiaoxian of the 市 People's Education Center, Zhang Shousong, and more than ten others to go to the various pigeon nest locations to record the data accurately.</p>
<p>Top Ten Ranked, Settlement Completed</p>
<p>The method of calculating the results this time is based on the standard mileage of the race and the distances from the pigeon nests, adding or subtracting the difference to obtain the true distance, and then proportionally calculating it separately with the flight time of the race pigeons. The rankings are as follows:</p>
<p>Rank Race Pigeon Mark Pigeon Owner Flight Speed per Minute</p>
<p>(1) Leg Circle 2068 Li Meiling 894.20 meters</p>
<p>(2) Wing No. 4 Zhou Yimin 892.39 meters</p>
<p>(3) Leg Circle 697 Sun Xia 891.71 meters</p>
<p>(4) Leg Circle 1514 新闻 News Agency 877.80 meters</p>
<p>(5) Leg Circle 2063 Li Meiling 877.08 meters</p>
<p>(6) Leg Circle 587 新闻 News Agency 865.10 meters</p>
<p>(7) Wing No. 5 Zhou Yimin 864.12 meters</p>
<p>(8) Leg Circle 1333 新闻 News Agency 864.11 meters</p>
<p>(9) Leg Circle 173 Sun Xia 861.83 meters</p>
<p>(10) Leg Circle 1541 Zhou Changshan 854.73 meters</p>
<p>Scheduled Award Ceremony, Public Exhibition</p>
<p>The calculation of the results of the pigeon race is extremely complex. Currently, only the initial calculation has been completed. The full results will be announced after accurate verification, and prizes will be awarded on a scheduled basis. All race pigeons that are included in the top ten must also notify the pigeon owner to hand them over to the park for viewing for two days when claiming the prize.</p>

<h3>Shanghai County Government Orders Prohibition of Encroachment on Township Road Foundations</h3>
<p>The width of the road foundations in the Qiansan Township road, from Qianliang Temple in Puxi to Sanlintang in Pudong, Shanghai County, is 2.5 meters in the Pudong section and 3.3 meters in the Puxi section. The Pudong section has already been widened and completed, and the Puxi section is also half completed. The County Government has received reports that residents along the road in the township have been encroaching on the road foundations, which is hindering road administration.

<h3>Construction of a Ten-Story Building by the Two Railway Bureaus Begins with Demolition of Residences</h3>
<p>Funding of 700,000 Yuan Allocated from the Companions' Support Fund, Approved by the Ministry of Railways, Construction Scheduled to Begin in Early July</p>
<p>The office of the Joint Administration of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways was completely destroyed by Japanese aircraft during the January 28th Incident. The main office was temporarily located in the Riverside Mansion. Afterwards, the remaining buildings were repaired and used as the Traffic Department and the railway station. Because the two locations were too far apart, it was very inconvenient to handle affairs. Therefore, a plan was made to construct a ten-story building to house both offices together. Funding for construction has been decided, and old houses on Baoshan Road will soon be demolished. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Funding for the Building Has Been Secured</p>
<p>According to a person in charge of the Bureau yesterday, the Bureau's office building has now been decided to be a ten-story building next to Baoshan Road. The funding is tentatively set at 700,000 yuan, which is collected from the Companions' Support Fund of the two railways. In the future, the principal and interest will be repaid annually with the rent currently paid for the Riverside Mansion. At the same time, the Bureau will request the consent of the China and British Bank Corporation. The architectural design has already been entrusted to architect Dong Dayou.</p>
<p>Acquisition of Residences Approaching Demolition</p>
<p>The Railway Bureau has acquired residences next to Baoshan Road, including six three-story buildings, with addresses starting from No. 9, No. 39, No. 47, No. 53, No. 59, and No. 65; and seven two-story buildings, with addresses starting from No. 10, No. 19, No. 20, No. 21, No. 22, No. 25, and No. 24, covering an area of more than three mu. Demolition will begin soon and is scheduled to be completed this month.</p>
<p>Ministry of Railways Approves Public Bidding for Construction</p>
<p>After the funding for the construction of the ten-story building by the Two Railways Bureau was determined to be allocated from the Companions' Support Fund, it was reported to the Ministry of Railways for approval, which has been granted. Architect Dong Dayou has also been requested to design the building plans. Once reviewed and approved, public bidding will be invited for construction. Construction is expected to begin around July and be completed by the spring of next year.</p>

<h3>Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Society Begins Inoculation</h3>
<p>Schools Scheduled to be Conducted in Stages; Households to be Inoculated Door-to-Door</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Society, in view of the arrival of summer and to prevent epidemics, protect health, and maintain social stability, is making every effort to carry out mosquito and fly extermination campaigns, conduct active epidemic prevention propaganda, and has scheduled to begin mass free inoculation immediately. It is expected that the incidence of epidemics among the coolies can be greatly reduced compared to previous years. There is no doubt about this. The following is what we have learned about the implementation:</p>
<p>Individual Inoculation</p>
<p>The Society's headquarters on East Jiaxing Road and the Tailai Lane branch on Maigen Road have already started inoculation work. Temporary branches may need to be added to focus on epidemic prevention work. Inoculation is limited to public rickshaw pullers in the Public Concession, as well as the pullers' parents, female relatives, and children.</p>
<p>Residential Inoculation</p>
<p>The cause of epidemics is unsanitary diet and living habits, which easily lead to transmission. At the same time, in view of the fact that most working-class pullers' families lack knowledge and may not know the way to the clinics established by the Society, as a remedy, the Society's mobile nurses will carry the necessary medicines and inoculate the population and residences door-to-door at the homes of the pullers.</p>
<p>School Inoculation</p>
<p>The Society's inoculation, regardless of age, must be administered at least three times per person, once a week, to a sufficient weight of 20, so that no epidemic occurs within six months.</p>
<p>Other</p>
<p>The Society currently has two clinics, and since their opening, they have been actively carrying out medical work. From January to April of this year, the total number of patients treated was 10,782, mostly divided into the following categories: Surgery: skin diseases 31.8%, injuries 8.3%, ear, nose, throat, and eye 18.9%, venereal diseases 9.6%; Internal Medicine: respiratory diseases 7.8%, gastrointestinal diseases 8.4%, rheumatism 3.4%, fever 0.6%, heart 0.1%, smoking cessation 11%, neuritis 0.38%.</p>
<h3>Third Section of the Public Safety Bureau; Zhabei Branch Merged</h3>
<p>The Zhabei branch of the Third Section of the Municipal Public Safety Bureau, originally located in Tong'an Lane, Changan Road, Zhabei, received all criminal cases from various sub-bureaus and sub-stations in the new Zhabei station and city center, such as Wusong, Jiangwan, and Zhenru, for adjudication. It is learned that Director Cai Jinjun, in order to save expenses, proposed and passed a resolution at the Bureau's meeting to merge redundant agencies. Therefore, the Zhabei branch of the Third Section was ordered to stop accepting cases around 4 p.m. the day before yesterday, and the branch will be merged. If there are any escorted criminals from the sub-bureaus, they will be temporarily received by the North Station Sub-Bureau, and the General Bureau will send a vehicle three times a day, at 6 a.m., 1 p.m., and 7 p.m., to transport them. It is also learned that the branch's equipment will be moved to the General Bureau within the day.</p>
<h3>New Payment Method for Water and Electricity Bills Announced by French Electricity Company; Payment Required within Eight Days of Receiving the Letter</h3>
<p>The Shanghai French Tramway and Electricity Company issued a notice yesterday regarding the new payment method for water and electricity bills, stating: "Regarding the notice, according to the provisions of the amended contract published in the French Concession Public Works Bureau Gazette on April 11, 1935, the provisions of Article 11 of the Electricity Contract, Article 12 of the Power Contract, Article 12 of the Electric Heating Contract, and Article 15 of the Water Contract shall be repealed, and the newly established method shall replace them from May 15, 1935. A bill indicating the amount of usage and the amount due will be sent by the post office to the user once a month. The user should come to the Company or its affiliated offices to pay the bill within eight days from the date of delivery of the bill by the post office. The payment deadline will be indicated on the bill. Regardless of the amount of the bill, the user can use a check to submit to the Company for a receipt. If the bill cannot be paid within the deadline stated on the bill, the user will receive a letter requesting payment within five days. If payment is not made after five days, the Company reserves the right to suspend supply (electricity, electric light, power, electric heating for electricity bills; tap water for water bills) and pursue the overdue amount through legal channels. The user shall not use discrepancies in consumption as an excuse to refuse payment. Therefore, the amount on all bills should be paid as is, but the user may request the Company to consider the user's losses at the next billing. However, if the protest is considered reasonable, the Company may immediately refund the amount collected in cash. The places where water and electricity bills should be paid include the General Office at 249 Luban Road, 406-408 Gongguan Road (West of Zilaihuo Street and East of Zilaihuo Street), the East District Office, and 1314 Xiafei Road (near Shanzhong Road), the West District Office.

<h3>Lu Konghai Speeded up Delivery of Calligraphy and Seal Carving at Reduced Prices</h3>
<p>Lu Jun Zonghai's exquisite calligraphy and seal carving have been famous at home and abroad for many years. His calligraphy is most skillful in seal script and official script, with a vigorous and unrestrained spirit. His carving directly pursues the Qin and Han styles and can avoid being confined to Zhejiang and Anhui styles. Recently, in view of the fact that truly skilled calligraphers and seal carvers in the market often regard their works as rare commodities, while those with low prices are vulgar and unbearable to look at, he has specifically proposed two items, fan surfaces and stone seals, to reduce the price and speed up the delivery of works in order to reform the accumulated habits of famous scholars. The price for writing a fan, regardless of seal script or official script, is one yuan per page including the fan surface. The price for carving a stone seal, regardless of red or white characters, is one yuan per seal including the ordinary stone seal for four characters or less. Delivery will be made within two days and will never be delayed. Orders can also be placed by mail. For this city, someone will be sent to deliver the works within two days of receiving the letter. For other cities, the works will be sent by registered mail within two days of receiving the letter (but please attach two dimes of postage for postage outside this city). It is heard that Mr. Lu's address is the Health Section of the Two Railways, 527 Laobazi Road, Shanghai.</p>

The service has sent the propaganda team leader, Pan Shiguang, to contact them to schedule the screenings.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Mu Zhi's Waterside Pavilion</h3>
<p>— (Zhu Zi)</p>
<p>Outside the East Gate of Yixing, there is a stream that meanders around. In the middle stands a decaying pavilion. It is said that this is "Mu Zhi's Waterside Pavilion." Mu Zhi was a poet of the late Tang Dynasty who admired the beautiful mountains and waters of Yixing, so he built the waterside pavilion to live in. Even now, after thousands of years, it still allows posterity to look up to and admire the ruins. I cannot help but feel a deep sense of emotion!</p>
<p>Here, there are no beautiful embellishments or luxurious decorations. Nor are there any calligraphy and paintings by famous people for later generations to appreciate. There are only a few broken tiles and half a broken wall, as well as cobwebs covering the holes. The inscriptions on a horizontal plaque above the beam are also unreadable. In the past, many literati gathered here, all with a sense of nostalgia, to come here to mourn the past. On the one hand, they could escape the summer heat, drink tea, welcome cool breezes, and admire the moon. Now, it has not been repaired for a long time, and it has become so desolate that later generations may forget it.</p>
<p>Travel Supplement</p>
<h3>Two Landscape Paintings</h3>
<p>— One Leaf</p>
<p>In art criticism, even a very small painting is considered superior as long as the artistic elements on the screen are rich. Conversely, even a gigantic structure spanning tens of feet is considered a base work if it lacks artistic meaning. Now, let us apply the aesthetic measurement method to local places of interest and feel that there is nothing wrong with it.</p>
<p>I discovered this view quite by chance, during this spring break travel period. I have seen many places of interest, but only Egret Island in Nanjing and Slender West Lake in Yangzhou have the artistic conditions recognized above.</p>
<p>First, let me unfold the scroll of Egret Island:</p>
<p>A piece of cold water dotted with a little moss, sparsely soaking a few green grasses. On the edge of the pond, clumps of rapeseed flowers bloom in rows. In the distance, several small farmhouses are scattered among the peaceful willows and dikes. As the gentle sunset reflects the shadow of half of the ancient city, two or three virgins or young women wearing spring clothes gently knock the pestle by the bridge and pond. From this intermittent rhythm, looking back at the dilapidated pavilions and desolate situation sheltered by green willows in front of the island, one cannot help but feel lost, lingering and reluctant to leave—</p>
<p>As for the abundance of Slender West Lake, Du Mu's poem "A graceful maiden, a little over thirteen" describes it perfectly. Indeed, comparing Slender West Lake to a woman, especially a delicate and lively little girl, is most wonderful. The beauty of a woman lies in her active and graceful curves. Slender West Lake itself is particularly rich in this curve. When you come out of Tianningmen and sit on a small boat at Wen Yue Bridge or Green Willow Village, slowly paddling on this slender lake, meandering, turning, and circling among the spring waves and willow shade, passing through the Rainbow Bridge, Small Golden Mountain, and all the way to Pingshan Hall, the twists and turns of the lake become even more wonderful. This contains endless profound meaning and delicate lingering sentiment. When you reach Microwave Gorge, you will really be so obsessed that you think of a woman's slender waist. The beauty of the rhythm of the line is the same as that of the model in the life drawing studio. It makes your hands tremble and your heart throb! The scenery along the coast is also complex and well-organized: old city walls, waterside pavilions, exquisite bridges, bright lake villages, and a powdery green color everywhere, which is the unique background of Yangzhou, the city of willows.</p>
<h3>Riding a Horse to Tiger Hill</h3>
<p>— Wu Yafei</p>
<p>I took the 5 o'clock early train and arrived in Suzhou. Because it was still early before the scheduled departure of the Mududu ferry, Xiong and I wanted to visit Tiger Hill; we planned to return on the third ferry. Xiong was very happy to hear that we were going to Tiger Hill, but because he loved riding horses, he rented two white horses from Songji Stable and we rode slowly towards Tiger Hill.</p>
<p>The warm spring sun shone on the earth, and a light breeze brushed our necks, bringing an intoxicating fragrance; it cleared the stuffiness in our chests that had been there for so long. We hummed a spring love song, surrounded by such quietude. In the fields, patches of green wheat and patches of yellow rapeseed flowers flew past our eyes in succession. The clear singing and the clattering of horses' hooves echoed each other. We walked along a road paved with gravel...</p>
<p>After turning a few bends to the left and right, the West Garden Forest of the ancient Sanwu Temple was already in front of us. At that time, Xiong wanted to go to the West Garden to see the five-colored fish, so we got off our horses in front of the temple and barged into the temple. Inside the mountain gate, we found a streamlined modern car, which must have been left here by a "rich old man" from Shanghai. The temple was so solemn. Apart from a few novice monks walking back and forth, it was almost as silent as death. We squeezed through a door, which led to a simple garden. We saw a dense forest of trees and a pool of still, clear water that was so clear that you could see the bottom. Stepping out of the mountain gate, we walked a few steps to the left and came to a small garden. In the "release pond," there were many of the so-called five-colored fish eating duckweed. Xiong threw the biscuits he had brought into the pond, and the fish came in groups to eat, and soon all five biscuits were swallowed.</p>
<p>After playing for a long time, I looked at the watch on my wrist and knew that it was getting late, so I quickly urged Xiong to mount his horse, tightened the reins in my hand, and the horse galloped forward on four hooves.</p>
<p>The temple of Tiger Hill and the pagoda of Tiger Hill both appeared very clearly in front of us. However, when we reached the foot of the hill, the horse suddenly stumbled forward, causing me to lose my balance on the horse. Unexpectedly, I fell off the horse. I quickly used my hand to support myself, and a large piece of skin had been scraped off my palm. My knee was also broken, and bright red blood gurgled from the wound. Because of the pain, I had no intention of playing any more; "Although I have arrived at Tiger Hill, I will not be able to play at Tiger Hill after all!" Xiong said with a sigh.</p>
<p>The two of us abandoned the horses and hired two rickshaws to return to Xumen. Mei gave me a wash to get the blood off, wrapped the wound and said:</p>
<p>"Who told you to leave the carriage and ride a horse to show off your prestige!"</p>
<h3>Wuling Ancient Cave</h3>
<p>— (Zhu Zi)</p>
<p>Wuling Cave is located in the Wengmu Mountains of Yixing. It is located in a remote area and rarely visited, but it is actually a scenic spot. It is a pity that there are no connoisseurs to appreciate it. In early spring, we went to play. There was soft grass, fragrant flowers, and towering ancient trees. If it is autumn, there will also be the red leaves of Dry Mountain, which will add to the beauty of the scenery.</p>
<p>The cave entrance is narrow, and ancient vines hang on the four walls. Along the way, the strange rocks are rugged, each expressing its different posture. The mountain stream flows from underground, gurgling. Going further in, it is wider than the outside, and you can see the sunlight. The sunlight gently brushes the faces of the tourists, making them feel very comfortable.</p>
<p>The deeper you go, the darker it gets, and you can't reach the end. The clouds there are also too thick, and sometimes drops of water fall down. It is said that some people have ventured all the way in and can reach the border of Anhui Province, but this cannot be confirmed. If this cave can be renovated, it will definitely be spectacular in the future.</p>
<h3>Old Touring Spot of Right Army</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Leaving the dead-like city, the sparse morning stars in the sky still emit their last faint light.</p>
<p>There can be no more silence! This slightly cold spring morning: The fine fog, similar to two things, invades our bodies incessantly, but! Our interest in touring, on the contrary, has become stronger because of this!</p>
<p>Just when we felt that our legs were sore and tired, suddenly, we saw the sharp black shadow towering in the foothills.</p>
<p>Oh! Isn't that the spire of the solemn "Yanggao Pavilion"? Aren't those light gray houses the Jin Dynasty General Wang Youjun Temple?</p>
<p>Indeed, the old touring spot of Right Army – Duxiu Mountain, has indeed arrived! But! It is still hiding shyly in the milky white morning mist, unwilling to meet us.</p>
<p>The lush green hills nearby are also like sleepy lazy women, still having their sweet dreams.</p>
<p>Entering the Ke Shi Temple built in the mountain waist pine Xue bushes, looking up, there is a horizontal plaque of "Youjun Old Touring Spot" written by You Meng Four Daoren Lv Kun, which appears in our eyes!</p>
<p>Although the temple is so simple and simple, it is so quiet and beautiful, deeply containing the ancient elegance of the seventeenth century, enough to make our hearts feel a lot more comfortable!</p>
<p>There are many gods and many couplets in the temple: I think this couplet is the most lovely, and the handwriting of this couplet is also the most firm and elegant:</p>
<p>"Goose Pond retains ancient relics, joyfully inviting tourists with poetry and wine, remembering that the land belonged to Right Army in those years, who would ask, a few strokes of the morning bell, several sounds of evening drum.</p>
<p>Vulture Ridge traces the remains, once overlooking the lakes and mountains, seeing that the peaks are high and unique at this moment, what more is needed, the wind and moon of Six Bridges, the clouds and smoke of Three Temples. One</p>
<p>In front of the temple is a stone tablet with mottled moss marks. The center of the tablet is engraved with the four characters "Ke Shi Jia Di". On both sides, there are several lines of small, unpretentious characters: "Yu Xing Pi Hao You, entering Sheng arrived at Taoyuan Township, [blurred] saw Lin [blurred] steep, natural landscape, [blurred] Feng Hua Mao Yupei [blurred] inscription." On the back of the tablet, there is also a seven-character quatrain: "The towering hundred-foot green [blurred] Many immortals, everywhere [blurred] Hong left fingerprints, the wind left should not give way to the former sages. [Blurred] Yi Zhi Zai Ke Shi Mountain, also known as Duxiu Mountain, also known as Chuanshan [blurred]." Having experienced vicissitudes, most of the traces have been blurred!</p>
<p>The top of the mountain is the flat and wide "Wang Lang Ping", and to the left of the temple is the "Paper Fan Pool". The pool is very small, under the chaotic rocks, and the clear, pure pool water reflects the green shade of the verdant pines and cypresses, just like the face of a girl without makeup. Really? Did the paper fan that Youjun listened to painting on in the past really fly into here? But! Who has seen it?</p>
<p>Ah! Youjun, why did you leave the Ink Pond? And why did you leave the Goose Pond? Only to make future generations mourn! And where is your favorite "Wind Cave" that hears music with the wind?</p>
<h3>A Record of the Scenery of Xuanmu</h3>
<p>— Yin Qiu</p>
<p>My family's ancestral tomb is located in Tongjing Mountain in Guangfu. This time, taking advantage of the convenience of ancestor worship, I was able to fully enjoy the scenery of Xuanmu. In the late spring, the weather was clear and bright, and I was even more pleased that my father was healthy and strong, climbing and enjoying the scenery, and his interest was even greater. On that day, I left the city at 7 o'clock and boarded a wheel in Zaoshi. There were not many passengers, and I felt comfortable. I met my familiar friends Zhu and Liu, who were traveling on the same boat, and it broke the silence. I started the boat at 8 o'clock and arrived at Mududu at 9:30. At 10 o'clock, I passed Shimatou, and half an hour later, I passed Wufeng Mountain and reached Shanren Bridge. Those who travel to the mountains of Qionglong and Tianchi all disembark here, and at 12 o'clock, I had arrived in Guangfu. First, I took a short rest at the inn, had my fill, and then took a bamboo sedan chair into the mountain to visit the tomb. The tomb path was deep and the forest was lush. Thinking of the virtues of my ancestors, I couldn't help but feel the thought of pursuing the distant — After the sacrifice, it was still early, and the interest in travel was ignited.</p>
<p>First, I went to Baiyin Society, that is, Situ Temple. I entered the Ancient Cypress Mountain Room and was led by Monk Peigen to view the "Qing Qi Guai" four ancient cypresses. The strange one sings and lies down, the Qing one soars. The one that spirals upwards is ancient, and the one that combines the lower and divides the upper is extravagant. In fact, there are still two trees, which are also extremely enchanting, and their arrogant attitude is no less than the four. Adding them together is six, but because of Emperor Qianlong's rating, the two are not prominent. The Buddhist room is called Liuxiang Pavilion, and two couplets are hung: one is "A Qing Qi Guai is difficult to paint, the wind, fire, thunder, and robbery cannot grind", which was written by Wu Yun of Guian during the Tongzhi period; the other is "Only phoenixes and luan are allowed to roost in this place, and there should be jiaochi dragons coiling above", which was written by Pan Zunqi, a native of Tongjing Mountain. Next to it is Bailu, in which there is an ancient cypress painted by Monk Tieqiao. His idea is that it is not appropriate to divide the four cypresses with four words, so that each occupies one word. The clear one has never not been strange, the strange one has never not been ancient, the ancient one is also strange, and the strange one is also clear. The saying that the clear, strange, ancient, and strange are all possessed by the cypresses has a lot of insight. Therefore, I composed a quatrain: "To respect the ancient cypress, I came to the mountain room, the old trunk and strange branches are surrounded by green. I was also born with an arrogant bone, not knowing that there is ice and frost in the world."</p>
<p>After coming out, I followed a narrow path through the winding plum forest, until I reached Xuanmu Mountain, in front of Sheng'en Temple. Ancient trees towered into the sky, and the secluded path released my worldly clothes. Inside is the Brahma Pavilion, with a plaque written by Wang Shimin "Haiyin Sends Out Light". The upper floor is the Ten Thousand Buddha Pavilion, which was built by the former abbot Zhongshu. To the right is Huanyuan Pavilion, that is, the place where Emperor Kangxi stayed, which is open and spacious, similar to Jiangge Pavilion of Jiaoshan Temple and Huo Menglou Pavilion of Jiming Temple. Looking at Taihu Lake from the railing, the clouds and waves are full of thousands of atmospheres, which is the most beautiful place in the temple. There are many inscriptions on the walls, such as Li Genyuan's recording of Zheng Suonan's sentence, "The clouds are deep in the ancient temple, and the moon is cold in the autumn day": Yu Youren's sentence of sleeping on the pavilion at night, "The bell urges the bright moon to rise, and the wind sends Taihu Lake to come"; and Kang Nan Hai's poem, "The hills and valleys are deep and the road is full of pines, millions of plum blossoms are fragrant and cold, the ancient tombs and stones are from the Jin Dynasty, and the ancient temples are in the setting sun and the Zhou Dynasty bells; the incense sea people are thirty miles away, and the Taihu Lake waves are hundreds of thousands of peaks; the Han mountain says that the Dharma is empty, but it leads the mountain to love the mountains and rivers". It can be realistic, and I have also gotten a poem after sitting for a long time: "Ten thousand plum trees lead to a path, I am leisurely looking for an ancient temple in this mountain, I climb directly to Huanyuan Pavilion, and the clouds and water are vast and reflect the blue sky."</p>
<p>After going down the mountain, I still had energy, so I went to Dongyan Cottage, which is the other residence of my friend Wu Silan. The garden is secluded and the structure is exquisite. There are scenic spots such as Looking at Clouds and the Conggui Small Pavilion. On the wall, there is a couplet I had written in the past: "Being proud and forgetting words, the refined houses and pavilions link the distant hills; indulging in seclusion and loving the Qing Dynasty, the waves and clouds reflect the sparse forest"; it is a compilation. The willow dike outside the door is near the water and facing the mountain, and the scenery is especially secluded! I also composed a poem: "The thatched cottage is lonely in the old family, the willow silk is by the water outside the door, the most poetic is infinitely good, two or three fishing boats are in the setting sun."</p>
<p>The next morning, because the scenery of Hushan Bridge was very beautiful and not far from the town, I walked there. There is Hushan Temple next to the bridge, and nearby is Yucun, which is said to be Yunlin's former residence. At that time, the dawn was just dawning, and the peaks on the lake were reflected in the painting. The fishing piers and woodcutter paths were like another world. I continued to get a poem: "Hushan Temple, Hushan Bridge, the dawn is just dawning, the meaning is lonely, the water is blue and the mountains are green, like a painting, when will I build a house with the fishermen and woodcutters." After returning, I recorded it.</p>
<h3>Dragon Flower Half-Day Trip</h3>
<p>— Transferred from Tao</p>
<p>It had been a long time since I visited Longhua. I vaguely remembered the antiquity of the Longhua Pagoda. The day before yesterday afternoon, I went to Longhua with a few female companions and spent half a day there. The area and architecture of the ancient Longhua Temple are very grand, but unfortunately, it is in a state of disrepair. According to some research, the construction of Longhua dates back to the Sun Quan period, making it truly a historical site. It was later burned down by Xu Wending Gong, so it has not been restored to its former glory. Although Xu Wending Gong was a Catholic, he shouldn't have burned down such an ancient temple, regardless of any conflicts with his beliefs. There was no need for such a blatant destruction. Even though it was a trace of superstition, it was also an embellishment to the scenery.</p>
<p>There are many tall Buddha statues in the temple, and some of them are currently being re-gilded. Several Buddha statues have already been completed, showing a golden and brilliant color, which is incomparable to those that have not been re-gilded. People need clothes, and Buddha statues certainly need gold. The monks in the temple are busy with fundraising work. Every Buddha hall has a donation book. In this society of poverty and exhaustion, people are still willing to donate this kind of money, which shows the greatness of divine power! We, who appreciate the scenery, might as well hope that their wealth will flow in and that in a few years, the golden and splendid Longhua Temple will once again compete with the sunset.</p>
<p>I strolled around for a week and saw the plaques personally inscribed by several prominent figures of the party and the nation. However, there are few pilgrims and even fewer tourists. It seems that the incense season of Longhua has passed. According to the locals of Longhua, Longhua doesn't really have an incense season. Instead, it's more of a peach blossom season, because more people come to Longhua to see the peach blossoms than to offer incense. I wanted to find some enchanting peach blossoms, but it really became a case of "the faces of the people are not flushed, and the spring breeze laughs at people."</p>
<p>I remember that "Pagoda Shadow Evening Bell" is one of the eight scenic spots of Longhua. The Longhua Pagoda is certainly a famous scenic spot in Shanghai. In fact, Longhua Pagoda is the common name used by the locals, called Bao'en Pagoda. I apologize for not yet researching what kind of story that is. The pagoda is seven stories high, and it doesn't look very tall. Considering its dilapidated and old appearance, it must have been quite tall. I've heard artists say that pagodas should be ancient. The older they are, the more flavorful they are. Therefore, the Tiger Hill Pagoda in Suzhou and the Baochu Pagoda in Hangzhou are both rare scenic spots and special embellishments. Then, the Longhua Pagoda can also be considered good material in the hands of artists. I first looked at the lowest level of the pagoda and saw only a dark and gloomy scene. The small candles lit in front of the Buddha flickered like will-o'-the-wisps in the wilderness. Where did I have the courage to climb the pagoda? I only dared to wander around at the foot of the pagoda for a while, gazing at the slanting sunset and the crows returning to their nests, flying in groups to the upper levels of the decaying pagoda. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Jiangda Games Opened Yesterday; Qiu Guangbian's High Jump Breaks the Meeting Record</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 10th telegram. The 8th Jiangda Track and Field Games opened at 2:30 PM at the Zhongda Stadium despite the heavy rain. Seventy-seven athletes from six schools—Guanghua, Chizhi, Fudan, Jinan, Jinling, and Zhongda—attended. President Rong Qizhao presided over the meeting, and honorary president Luo Jialun delivered a speech. He stated that holding this meeting one day after the National Humiliation Day was of great significance. To revitalize the nation and avenge the humiliation, it cannot be accomplished by bookworms who wag their heads and swing their tails, nor can it be accomplished by a few athletes who run fast and jump high. The majority of the people must have strong physiques, as well as knowledge, skills, and excellent character. Today, you gentlemen are holding track and field competitions in the rain, which shows your courage. Before the competition, you held an oath-taking ceremony, which shows your spirit. I hope that in future Jiangda Games, all students from various universities will be mobilized to change the sports atmosphere in schools across the country. Then, there will be hope for revitalizing the nation. After Luo's speech, the rain stopped, and the sky cleared. After all the athletes took a photo, the competition began at 3:00 PM. Only Zhongda University registered for the women's competition this year, so the women's competition was canceled.</p>
<p>Scores of Each School</p>
<p>Today's final results: In track and field, Zhongda scored 19 points, Fudan scored 18 points, Guanghua scored 5 points, and Jinling scored 2 points. Zhongda has great hope of continuing to maintain the field event championship, but the track championship still has competition among Zhongda, Guanghua, and Fudan. It is difficult to predict who will win. On the 10th, Qiu Guangbian of Fudan broke the meeting record in the high jump. President Luo of Zhongda invited all the athletes to a tea party in the gymnasium to celebrate. The conference plans to continue the competition at 2:00 PM on the 11th and close the conference after giving awards at 5:00 PM. Athletes from various schools will return to Shanghai on the 12th.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Education Funds Released as Scheduled</h3>
<p>Another Half-Month's Funds to be Released on the 15th</p>
<p>Jiangsu's education funding mainly comes from land taxes in various counties, followed by slaughter and tooth taxes. The management of slaughter and tooth taxes has been improving in recent years. The major land taxes in various counties, after being managed by the responsible department of the Education Funding Management Office, have been put on track. In addition, with the support of Jiangsu Finance Director Zhao for education, various counties have been able to submit the education funds from land taxes on time, unlike in the past when they were diverted for other uses. Therefore, Jiangsu's education funding has become more stable in recent years and can be released as scheduled. It is heard that the funding notices for the second half of April for rural normal schools and provincial elementary schools in Jiangsu Province (social education institutions, vocational schools, and normal schools are for the first half of April, and middle schools are for the second half of March) have been processed and stamped by the Education Department and will be sent to various schools on the 10th. The due date is filled in as the 15th, and they can be cashed at the bank on that date. It is also heard that the Education Funding Audit Committee will meet on the 10th of this month to sign off on one month's funding for each school and institution (one month for rural normal schools and elementary schools in May, the second half of April and the first half of May for social education institutions, vocational schools, and normal schools, and one month for middle schools in April). It is estimated that the educational treasury's deposits can still cover this one month's funding by the end of May.</p>

<h3>Financial Stagnation, Call Loan Rates Unchanged</h3>
<p>Recently, in the silver dollar market, as relief loans for industry and commerce have not yet been implemented, silver firms are mostly taking a wait-and-see attitude towards business operations, leading to a dull financial situation and stagnant prices. Yesterday, call loan rates in the market remained at 1.2% in the morning and afternoon. Adding water to the "Hua Tou" was also fruitless. In call ticket transactions, over 3.7 million were transferred in the morning market, with over 500,000 in new transactions. No activity was reported in the afternoon market. Transactions in the Small General Association totaled over 800,000. Pawned foreign silver transactions saw over 400,000 redeemed and over 200,000 in new transactions.

<h3>Securities and Bond Market Shows No Sign of Recovery</h3>
<p>Trading is Only More Active in the Opening Session; Market Price is Aiming for Only Five Fen</p>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the market showed no sign of recovery. The atmosphere was dull, as if in a stupor. No good news was heard, and no one fabricated bad news. The market price was stagnant due to the sluggish trading. There was no information that could be used for speculation. Even the 96 bonds were approaching peace, with an account balance of around 10-12 million yuan, which did not hinder the bulls' preparation of funds for delivery. Judging from the large purchases by No. 54 and the eating-in by retail investors, one can predict the steadfastness of the bulls. The general trend was still one of consolidation. The market price that both sides were competing for was only aiming for five fen. It seemed that an increase of one fen was considered expensive, and a decrease of one fen was considered cheap. The situation was that the opening session in the morning was stable and appeared to be active, and trading was relatively brisk. Nos. 20 and 54 bought over 1 million in current month 96 bonds, which was enough to arouse the interest of the general public. However, as long-term eating-in accounts became scarce, people's enthusiasm waned. The three subsequent trading sessions were all stagnant and lifeless, with most maintaining the original price. As a result, most of the market prices improved slightly by five fen to one jiao, with two jiao being the most for the entire six long-term contracts. The 96 bonds also returned up one jiao to one jiao and a half. The total turnover was 7,691,000 yuan. The results of the increases and decreases are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Rises Across the Board</h3>
<p>According to the report from Xin Feng Yanghang, yesterday (9th), the New York stock market advanced under the leadership of oil stocks. Only automobile stocks did not rise, due to the unresolved strike. The situation on the Small Exchange was very strong, and the bond market also showed strength. U.S. government bonds were dull and weak. The total daily trading volume was 1.65 million shares. The Dow Jones Futures Index is listed on the left:</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton; Little Room for Significant Increase in Traded Yarn</h3>
<p>The yarn market is trending upwards, but the market atmosphere is still calm, without a vigorously prosperous appearance. Due to large deliveries by major players recently, market prices have been hindered. However, the Sundry Cotton market is rising daily, and factory costs are increasing, but it is still difficult to stimulate new buying. In the previous market, Ningbo Hefeng Yarn Factory again sold short in the traded yarn market, so the market is difficult to advance.</p>
<p>Recent Yarn Hindered by Deliveries</p>
<p>In the traded yarn market, prices for all months rose uniformly in the opening session, but near-term months were weakened by deliveries from a certain party, falling back by 2, 3, and 4 jiao. Due to the Ningbo Hefeng factory selling over 2,000 bales short, the market became loose and flooded, but prices rose again at closing due to the firm rise in raw cotton, which lifted the yarn market. As a result, all months rose by 5, 7, 8, and 9 jiao compared to the previous day. The afternoon opening was still flat, but on the bullish side, purchases continued, and market prices still failed to rise. As a result, all months rose or fell by 1 jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Yuda sold 400 bales, Daji 900 bales, Taixing 500 bales, Runkang 2,100 bales, Jifeng 600 bales, Tongji 350 bales, Mingde 350 bales, Changji 900 bales, and Changfeng 1,100 bales. Dafu bought 400 bales, Tongfu 750 bales, Yuanda 1,500 bales, Gengfeng 1,150 bales, Shengyuan 350 bales, Deji 700 bales, Shenji 800 bales, and Runkang 600 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Traded Yarn / Highest Price / Lowest Price / Closing Price / Increase/Decrease / Inventory</p>
<p>May / 174.0 / 173.7 / 173.9 / Up 0.80 / 32,900</p>

<p>Total / 187,950</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Open Strong at 1,000 Bales</p>
<p>Current yarn sales are still good. It was found that the total amount bought by various gangs throughout the day was 1,055 bales. Market conditions were similar to the previous day. The amount purchased by each gang is as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong 405 / Haizhou 195 / Changsha 75 / Weihaiwei 15</p>
<p>Inland 100 / Nanyang 40 / Yunnan 160 / Wuhu 5</p>

<h3>Henan and Shaanxi Suffer Severe Drought, New Cotton Prices Soar</h3>
<p>The cotton market is trending upwards, and market sentiment is enthusiastic. Reports indicate that Henan and Shaanxi have suffered severe drought for six months. The cotton in Lingbao is severely dried and cannot be cultivated. Therefore, most people are bullish. Moreover, the rumor of increasing import duties on foreign cotton is rampant, so general cotton merchants are determined to hold tight. Therefore, the upward trend in the October new cotton contracts is becoming increasingly fierce.</p>
<p>Zheng Traded Market Sentiment is Enthusiastic</p>
<p>In the traded cotton market, prices for all months showed a significant increase in the opening session. The situation was favorable, and the buying force was stronger. Due to the recent turnaround in market sentiment, there are more bullish people. Moreover, northern cotton merchants are purchasing in large quantities daily, and market prices were already trending upwards. Now, with U.S. cotton new cotton rising by over 30 pounds and Indian cotton also rising by 2.5 rupees, it is like adding flowers to brocade. The northern new cotton is severely dry with no rain and cannot be planted. Buyers are flocking to the October new cotton contracts, and the upward trend is particularly intense. As a result, all months rose by 3.5 to 4 jiao compared to the closing price of the previous day. The afternoon opening was slightly flat, and prices returned to firm after three sessions. As a result, near-term months fell by 5 fen compared to the morning close, and the closing price was flat for far months, but the October contracts rose by 5 fen. It was found that Dafu sold 3,000 dan, Suilong 1,800 dan, Mingde 1,700 dan, Hexing 5,300 dan, Changji 2,500 dan, Senkang 1,100 dan, Yichang 1,600 dan, Shengyuan 5,300 dan, Yikang 1,900 dan, Weihe 3,700 dan, and Tongxing 2,000 dan. Dafu bought 4,200 dan, Jifeng 2,100 dan, Tongji 1,900 dan, Dafeng 3,500 dan, Zhenda 2,100 dan, Gengfeng 4,200 dan, Yuanyi 2,000 dan, Changfeng 4,600 dan, Runkang 4,800 dan, Yuanxingchang 1,900 dan, Yichang 1,900 dan, and Yongda 2,400 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Traded Cotton / Highest Price / Lowest Price / Closing Price / Increase/Decrease / Inventory</p>

<h3>Difference Between New and Old American Cotton Narrows Compared to Previous Month</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with active trading. Prices rose due to Johnston's statement and the purchase of new cotton by brokers from Wall Street and the Far East. Liverpool firms sold far-month contracts. Some in the market bought new cotton and sold old cotton, so the price difference between new and old cotton gradually narrowed. However, traders continued to buy July contracts and remained skeptical of new cotton. Later, New Orleans made purchases, and the government also showed signs of buying, so market prices rose again. The market closed strongly. Spot prices rose by 15 pounds, and futures prices rose by 13 to 32 pounds. British cotton spot prices rose by 2 points, and futures prices fell by 1-2 points. Indian cotton initially weakened due to selling by operators, but recovered later due to mass buying. Fair Gujerat rose by 1-3 rupees, Oomra rose by 1.25-2.75 rupees, and White Broach rose by 1.25-2.5 rupees. The original telegrams are recorded on the left (9th telegram):</p>

<h3>Grain; Prospects for the New Wheat Crop are Good; Active Buying of Flour and Wheat Futures</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday in the flour market, after opening in the morning, prices for all months showed a pattern of first being flat and then rising sharply. According to reports, Chicago wheat rose by 1 jiao and some li, and Canadian wheat rose by about 4 fen. When prices opened, market sentiment was calm because the increase in foreign wheat was still small. Then, the Tianjin gang's demand for spot flour was very urgent, and purchases of standard flour were becoming more active, so market sentiment gradually rose. For far-month contracts, the long drought in Henan and Shandong provinces may affect the new wheat harvest, so foreign buyers also competed to buy, and the market situation became tight. When the afternoon market opened, market sentiment remained firm. At that time, although factories finalized two shipments of Australian wheat at a price of 4 yuan and 7 jiao and 2 fen, one to this port and one inland, and both were sold short at the same time, the poor prospects for the new wheat crop still failed to suppress the market. As a result, the current month rose by 2 fen and 2 li and a half, June rose by 2 fen and a half, July rose by 2 fen, August rose by 2 fen and 2 li and a half, September rose by 3 fen, and October rose by 3 fen and a half.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday in the wheat futures market, after opening in the morning, prices for all months showed a pattern of initially being stable and then rising sharply. When prices opened, the weather was hot and humid, and there was fear of rain. The new wheat harvest was generally good in the Jiangnan region, with about 80% of the normal yield. However, after a long drought in Jiangbei, the yield may be reduced. Therefore, although opening prices were flat, they gradually rose. The poor prospects for the new wheat crop had a particularly strong impact on market sentiment in the far-term contracts. When the afternoon market opened, trading in all months remained active. The market had already entered a period of consolidation, because there were reports that two shipments of foreign wheat had been finalized at a price of only 4 yuan and 7 jiao and 2 fen. With this situation, the increase in prices stopped again. As a result, July rose by 8 fen, August rose by 7 fen, and September rose by a huge 1 jiao. Spot wheat was unusually popular, and customers asked for higher prices. All grades were raised by 5 fen. Shandong and Henan wheat opened at 4 yuan and 1 jiao for first grade, 9 fen for second grade. Jiangbei wheat opened at 4 yuan and 3 fen for first grade, and 3 yuan and 9 jiao and 7 fen for second grade. Suzhou wheat opened at 4 yuan and 8 fen, and Bengbu wheat opened at 4 yuan and 5 or 6 fen. Fuxin took 1,000 bags, and Fufeng wheat took 1,500 bags.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat May 8th / May 9th / Increase/Decrease</p>
<p>July / 95.625 / 96.125 / Up 0.50</p>
<p>September / 96.250 / 96.562 / Up 0.375</p>

<h3>Sweltering Weather Causes a Sharp Drop of 30-40 Cents in Imported Rice Prices</h3>
<p>Small Arrival of Foreign Rice; Corn Also Sees Price Decline</p>
<p>Yesterday, the total amount of local rice (from the Shanghai South area) arriving from various sources was 30 shipments (totaling over 6,000 piculs). However, due to the sweltering weather, people were unwilling to stock up on rice, leading to sluggish trading and a price decline in the market. The price of superior varieties like Sutong and Nangang Indica rice plummeted by 20-30 cents. Late rice varieties were even more severely affected, with only 200-300 bags handled by the Tianjin group. Some varieties dropped by as much as 40 cents. Inferior varieties like Yinyang and Dujian also experienced a slight price decrease of slightly over 2 cents due to unfavorable conditions. (Shanghai North) Over 10 shipments arrived from various groups along the river. Inventory in the market remained clear. However, there were still out-of-town sales. The market price opened higher, then declined slightly. Medium-grade rice dropped by 10-20 cents, and superior rice also dropped by more than 10 cents. Early thin Indica rice dropped slightly by 10-20 cents, and other prices also fell by nearly 10 cents.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of foreign rice suddenly declined in the market. This was mainly because of the continuous arrival of shipments, leading to increasing stockpiles. In the past month, more shipments of Saigon and broken rice were confirmed. With excessive stock and uninterrupted supply, both merchants and wholesalers became nervous and sought to sell off their holdings. Inland traders continuously handled rice but could not load all the rice onto vehicles. With large stocks, they also wanted to temporarily stop buying. Therefore, the total volume of foreign rice transactions yesterday was 14,000 bags (including forward contracts), and 1,250 bags of 客秈 (ke xian - customer Indica), which was less than in previous days. Sellers were also willing to lower prices to sell their rice, leading to a market price decrease of 4-5 cents to 10 cents.</p>
<p>Since the various disaster areas began to use corn as a staple food, the price has risen from 2.45 yuan to over 4 yuan. Last weekend, Tianjin corn was trading at 4.18 yuan. Although the market was surprisingly strong, markets such as Anqing watched and waited, unwilling to buy. Recently, only the Zhejiang-Shaoxing groups were active. Once demand weakened, this type of corn would easily decline. Yesterday, only 300 bags of Tianjin corn were traded in the market at a price of 3.9 yuan, a decrease of 28 cents compared to the previous market price.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Stagnant Foreign Sales of Zhenmei Green Tea</h3>
<p>—Market Price Plummets by 10 Yuan—</p>
<p>The tea market in this port, which is dominated by foreign firms, suddenly turned weak. Renowned European firms have already shipped out their first batch of new tea today. The tonnage of the second batch has not yet been allocated and is not urgently needed. Therefore, their attitude has become very passive. Yesterday, only Xiehe and Tianyu and other firms purchased Zhenmei green tea from the Anhui and Jiangsu areas in the market. Market prices plummeted by 6-7 yuan to as much as 10 yuan. Major shipments of Keemun black tea have already arrived in Shanghai. However, due to a request from a certain foreign firm, various tea warehouses have decided to formally display samples next Monday.</p>
<h3>Metals: Black Iron Sheets Affected by Tight Credit</h3>
<p>Black iron sheets are products frequently purchased by enamel factories and thermos bottle factories. In the past two months, supply was low and demand was high, leading to a good market situation. However, the market price was still inflated and unstable due to loose pricing and extended exchange rates. Recently, the market has been affected by tight credit conditions, and factories have stopped buying. Wholesalers have also stopped buying due to limited sales. Therefore, the market situation is steadily declining. Currently, the selling price per bundle is 7.23 yuan for 16-foot sheets and 7.34 yuan for 36-foot sheets, which is a decrease of 30-40 cents compared to the previous prices. However, recent arrivals are high, while sales remain slow, making it difficult for the market to improve in the short term.</p>

<p>Publishing World</p>
<h3>Publishing and Culture</h3>
<p>— Ye Qing</p>
<p>Publishing is the printing and distribution of books and newspapers – that is, publications. This is something everyone knows. Books, newspapers, or publications are records of human culture. With writing and printing, all culture has been recorded. This is also something everyone knows. So, isn't the relationship between publishing and culture very clear?</p>
<p>Yes. We can understand the cultural situation of a society at a glance from the published books and newspapers. Especially today, with cultural development, convenient printing, and easy paper production, almost everything from the present to the past, in civilized countries, has been published into books and newspapers. Therefore, whatever culture exists, so do books and newspapers. Culture acts on publishing.</p>
<p>But if the logical nature of human thought is certain, then past thought must become the determinant of current thought. So-called culture is a kind of ideological form, a product of thought. Even taking a broad definition, including behavior, is the same, because behavior is the materialization of ideas. In this way, books and newspapers published to record past culture also become the determinants of current thought. Publishing thus influences future culture. Don't we feel the effect of publishing on culture here?</p>
<p>If so, then according to the first principle, the poverty of our current publications, estimated by Mr. Shu Xincheng to be sixteenth in the world, is proof of our underdeveloped past culture. In this situation, we should make special efforts. History tells us that any culturally backward nation will be run over by the wheels of history and will not be able to survive. Therefore, striving to develop culture is a condition for our survival in the twentieth century.</p>
<p>In this way, according to the second principle, to develop culture, we must pay attention to publishing. If we want a certain kind of culture, we should look at what kind of publications exist. Today's books and newspapers are the seeds of future culture. Therefore, our future culture is revealed in today's book and newspaper publishing.</p>
<p>If these words are true, our future culture is very worrying. Because from our review of publishing, we know that the current publishing direction is leaning towards competition in ancient books and children's books. In terms of children's books, although there is no meaning in improving, it is very necessary for popularization. Only the large-scale publication of ancient books is an ominous thing. It will inevitably cause future culture to take on a retro look.</p>
<p>I am not fundamentally opposed to ancient books. Ancient books are records of ancient culture, and naturally they should be published for us to understand ancient culture. But our task is not to understand the past, but to create the future. China's past culture is indeed not as outstanding and far-reaching as modern Europe. If our future culture starts from China's past, it will be backward and will inevitably fall behind Europe's future. We must now catch up with them, keep pace with them, and never stay behind. Therefore, ancient books should not be published on a large scale.</p>
<p>Here, I want to add a sentence: it is naturally not appropriate to publish too many ancient books, and it is especially inappropriate to advocate reading ancient books. The proposal to preserve scriptures and literature should be opposed by the publishing, cultural, and educational circles. That is to reverse culture and publishing.</p>
<h3>Senior English Writer Dr. Li Denghui</h3>
<p>— Wu Daocun</p>
<p>When talking about the senior English writers in China, we immediately think of Dr. Li Denghui, the old president of Fudan University.</p>
<p>Dr. Li is 63 years old this year, so he can be called "old," and his work ethic is beyond the reach of many young people. Whether in winter or summer, he likes to eat ice, and he always orders "egg fried rice" when he has lunch at Fudan University (a large dish for 40 cents). When we see his tireless attitude while working at his desk or discussing the development of the school with the Fudan authorities, we forget his "old age."</p>
<p>He is not like Louis George, with the head of a giant on the body of a dwarf; his stature is moderate. Although he wears an old suit, he stands tall and dignified. Although he didn't return to China until he was thirty, he can now speak very good Mandarin, Shanghainese, and his native Fujian dialect. Although he is famous for his English, his French, German, Spanish, Italian, Greek, Latin, and Malay are all good. He often likes to listen to French and German songs on the radio. He looks respectable, but when you talk to him, you find him lovable. His kind face leaves people with a good and deep impression of him.</p>
<p>He could have become a high official, but for the past twenty or thirty years, he has been wholeheartedly dedicated to Fudan University. In the eyes of ordinary people, this may be "extremely foolish," but China needs this kind of "fool." He is also devoted to many charitable causes, and unfortunate people—such as poor and orphaned children—have benefited greatly from him. In terms of his spiritual harvest, he is undoubtedly a great millionaire. He is a faithful Christian.</p>
<p>He is sometimes very humorous; when there is a pile of letters on his desk, he will say, "This place has become a post office." Someone asked him for his opinion on Ms. Mao marrying an old man, and he said, "I have no opinion, because I am an old man myself." He sometimes seems a little sad. In a recent letter to a Yale classmate, he said: "In recent months, I have often received news of the deaths of classmates. We have been reduced from three hundred young and strong people to less than half. We have to give our place to our younger generations." But his interest in life is still very strong. He likes flowers and trees, and every flower and tree at Fudan University is planted under his direction. He is also preparing to build a new house for himself to live in, a simple and unadorned small house.</p>
<p>He is also very concerned about national affairs. He said, "If everyone contributes ten yuan to buy airplanes, wouldn't the country's military strength be strengthened?" He advocates saving the country through morality.</p>
<p>He has many English writings. Because he was once the English editor-in-chief of the China Book Company, he published several English textbooks at China Book Company. The Commercial Press published "Cultural Reader," "Li's Literary Model," "Li's Compilation of English Rhetoric and Composition," "Important Issues in China Today," etc. "Cultural Reader" reached six or seven editions after the national crisis. "Li's Compilation of English Rhetoric and Composition" is the only English rhetoric book in China today. It was once reprinted, but the reprint was discovered by the Commercial Press, and the reprinting company was fined 200 yuan. I asked him why he hasn't written a book recently. He said, "I was originally planning to compile a world history and a world geography. I have collected the material, but my wife has died, and I have no heart to compile it." From this, we can imagine the deep affection between him and his wife.</p>
<p>Let us wish Dr. Li Denghui good health.</p>
<h3>Impressions of Various Bookstores (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Li Hengzhi</p>
<p>Kaiming - New Life - Liming - Huatong</p>
<p>(4) Kaiming Bookstore - Kaiming Bookstore, which evolved from the "New Woman Magazine," can be considered one of the more successful of the emerging bookstores.</p>
<p>Because of the publication of more radical essays on women's issues in women's magazines, Zhang Xichen left the Commercial Press. In a one-story house, a few friends discussed publishing a magazine on women's issues. For the convenience of distributing the magazine, a bookstore was naturally needed. The "New Woman Magazine" and Kaiming Bookstore were born at the same time. Just like the initial creation of Beixin promoted the upsurge of the early New Literature Movement, the initial creation of Kaiming introduced many progressive theories on women's issues. The debate on "free love" and "free sex" in "New Woman" magazine caused a great wave. Although the "Boss Zhang" and his "staff," who left the Commercial Press due to dissatisfaction with the conservatism of women's magazines, timidly defended the so-called "love" of sexual indulgence in this debate, theories of love, such as those by Kollontai, were finally introduced at this time.</p>
<p>Kaiming Bookstore, on the other hand, can be said to be a group of middle school teachers. In the cultural world, they have their own detached faction. Since "New Woman" reached its unexpandable end, they very cleverly ended with the "general public." This was beneficial to Kaiming. They discovered their strengths, and this change led Kaiming to develop on another new path: the compilation of middle school textbooks and general middle school student reading materials. On this point, Kaiming laid its foundation. Later, although there were "Zhongbisheng Bookstore" and others that imitated it, none of them could catch up with Kaiming.</p>
<p>In terms of nature, Kaiming's several middle school textbooks cannot but be said to be more excellent. Although they wanted to advance from middle school textbooks to elementary school textbooks, they suffered some losses on elementary school textbooks last year, but the essence of the books is still good.</p>
<p>However, the sluggish economy envelops the new book industry, and Kaiming does not have the power to be as detached from its influence as the Commercial Press. The recent printing of a large number of old books, such as the Twenty-Five Histories, does not mean that Kaiming has become more advanced; on the contrary, it means that Kaiming feels exhausted in new book publishing and has to sell "pre-orders" with a huge amount of books in order to absorb cash. Secondly, the rise of Kaiming was due to the "family industrial" management of the "Zhang family," but now, Kaiming's scope is increasing, and internal relations are becoming increasingly complex, and necessary expenditures must also increase greatly. In this way, if a new way out cannot be found in publishing, this may not be Kaiming's crisis.</p>
<p>(5) New Life Bookstore - After the party purge, the "New Life Monthly" obtained the status of the most popular publications of the past, such as "New Youth," "Modern Review," and "Guide." Almost everyone was watching "New Life." The New Life Bookstore was thus established in the rapid development of "New Life Monthly."</p>
<p>In essence, the New Life Bookstore at that time was a "party organ bookstore" similar to the Minzhi Bookstore. The Three People's Principles reading materials were almost monopolized by the bureau. However, in the minds of the general public, it was not regarded as a "organ bookstore." Many emerging social science books of New Life were quite popular among general readers, and it can be said that at that time, only New Life Bookstore was still able to provide readers with some new books in the progressive social sciences. Another publication, "Society and Education," has gained an extremely wide readership. Isn't this a contradiction? This is where New Life Bookstore is beyond the reach of others.</p>
<p>With the decline of emerging social sciences, New Life Bookstore was once depressed for a while, and now it is regaining its original vitality. New Life has published most of the special books on the study of Chinese social history. The recent publication of "Food and Goods" cannot be said to be a stage in the significance of studying Chinese social history with new methods.</p>
<p>(6) Liming Bookstore - When mentioning Liming, people often compare it with Kaiming. In fact, Liming's direction is different from Kaiming's. The only thing they have in common is that Liming also has characteristics that individual bookstores do not have.</p>
<p>At the beginning of its creation, Liming can be said to be a university bookstore. The books it publishes are all voluminous university textbooks and famous works in social sciences. This is something that other bookstores regard as a daunting task, and it is also something that other bookstores find amazing. Then, before the rural reconstruction movement occurred, Liming published many books on rural issues, and soon published many works on rural education. In advance, it caused the incomprehension of general "wave-chasing" people, but afterwards, we cannot but say that this is Liming's special place.</p>
<p>I remember that a publication published by Liming in the past once stated its own policy, saying: The history of the new book industry is only a history of chasing the waves and imitating each other. After the literary book trend, there are social science books, then children's books and textbooks, and then reprinting old books. Each company does not have a certain policy. "But Liming is not without a policy in publishing. On the contrary, it has a consistent policy. We (Liming) believe that the important mission of the new book industry is to provide general readers with relatively reasonable knowledge and improve the general cultural level of our country. ... We... will not be shaken by any tempting waves. Not only was it like this before, but we will still be like this in the future."</p>
<p>That's right. For example, now, when everyone is advocating "humor," Liming's publication of "World Literature" has such a serious attitude. Another publication, "Chinese Rural," is also a monthly magazine that people who blindly promote rural revitalization and rural construction find headache-inducing.</p>
<p>(7) Huatong Bookstore - A bookstore operated by people outside the cultural circle has the same fate as Datong. At the time of its founding, it was not touted loudly, but now, it also has a sense of sunset.</p>
<p>Huatong's books have a characteristic, that is: they are not particularly bad, such as what "Wonderful Knights," "Sad History," and "100-Day Pass" of the "Friday and Saturday" school of writing are not available. But at the same time, there are no books that are relevant or of value. In the past, Huatong had a publication that introduced publications (called China Publishing Monthly). The text introduced in it was all innocuous, making people unable to say good or bad. This spirit is also fully expressed in the books published by Huatong.</p>
<p>In the past, Huatong's retail department was very attractive. Its characteristics were its wide collection and good layout, but it was soon overwhelmed by other retail departments. Although it also used what "Latin Quarter" cafes to attract customers, even the cafe itself did not observe the "needs" of readers.</p>

<h3>Wireless Radio Insecticide</h3>
<p>— Pao</p>
<p>In front of a peculiar wireless radio, a scientist put six live bees in a test tube, plugged the opening with cotton, and then hung the test tube between two square aluminum plates in front of the wireless radio with a string. Then he turned a very large variable resistor in the machine. At this time, nothing could be seen happening between the aluminum plates. After a few seconds, he turned off the wireless radio and took the test tube to check. Strange! Although there was no change in the posture of the bees in the tube, they were already lifeless. It turned out that they had been killed by an invisible wave.</p>
<p>The above is an experiment conducted by Thomas I. Headlee, director of the Entomology Department of the New Jersey State Agricultural Experiment Station. The purpose is to use a kind of radio wave to eliminate all agricultural pests that have long been enemies of mankind. The wireless radio mentioned in the previous section is no different from ordinary transmitters except that it does not use an antenna but instead uses two aluminum plates, and the wavelength used is different.</p>
<p>Radio waves of this special wavelength emitted in this way do not harm plants when they encounter them, but any insects that encounter them will die immediately in a few seconds, and there are no wounds on the corpses after death, and there are no traces of burns. However, the body temperature is much higher than before death. It is said that the reason why insects die is that this radio wave generates very high heat in the body.</p>
<p>This method not only specializes in killing agricultural pests, but can also be extended to other aspects. For example, canned food can use this method to sterilize it for long-term storage. Unfortunately, such radio waves require a lot of electricity, so although it has been successful in the laboratory, it cannot be practically applied commercially and needs to be further studied.</p>

<h3>Calculation Method of Self-Capacitance of Single-Layer Coil</h3>
<p>— Xingshi</p>
<p>(1) A New Formula</p>
<p>Usually in high-frequency applications, the most important characteristics of a coil are its inductance and resistance. However, there is also another characteristic that, under certain circumstances, can occupy the same important position as the former two, while it is often ignored in general. This is its distributed capacitance, or self-capacitance.</p>
<p>In most connections, this self-capacitance can be regarded as a fixed small capacitor that is permanently across the coil, limiting the highest plating of the resonant frequency. Therefore, generally speaking, when designing a coil, this self-capacitance should be made as small as possible. If there is a formula that can be used to find the value of this capacitance from the size of the coil, then this formula obviously has practical value.</p>
<p>In an article by A.G. Palermo in the July 1934 issue of a foreign wireless radio engineering magazine, the mathematical source and experimental situation of a new formula for calculating self-capacitance are described. This formula is applicable to single-layer coils whose length and straight diameter are similar (Same order). This formula is</p>
<p>Where Co is the self-capacitance (picofarads), D is the diameter of the coil, d is the diameter of the wire (not including insulation), and S is the pitch (i.e., the distance between the centers of two adjacent wires), all in centimeters. This formula can be written in a simpler form, such as</p>
<p>K is a constant, which varies with the ratio of pitch to wire diameter, and can be obtained from the curve in the first figure.</p>
<p>To facilitate readers to enlarge this curve, the corresponding values are written below:</p>
<p>The accuracy of this formula was verified by using nineteen coils of different sizes. The close fit between the experimental values and the calculated values can be seen in the second figure.</p>
<p>(2) The Importance of Pitch</p>
<p>There are two most interesting points in this new formula. First, the self-capacitance of those single-layer coils has nothing to do with the number of turns. Second, if the diameter of the wire is fixed, then the self-capacitance and the</p>
<p>change. Also, the situation of this change is very interesting. That is, when the distance between two adjacent wire seams is less than two diameters of the wire, if the gap between the wires is reduced, the self-capacitance increases sharply. On the contrary, if the distance between the two wires is greater than twice the diameter of the wire, then the gap is increased, and the impact on the self-capacitance is very small.</p>
<p>Therefore, when there is a special need to reduce the self-capacitance (such as coils and choke coils used for short waves), for this kind of coil with similar length and diameter, we can get a practical rule, that is, a gap should be left between the wires, so that the distance between two adjacent wires is greater than twice the diameter of the wire. This simple rule can also be roughly applied to choke coils whose length is much larger than the diameter, but accurate results cannot be obtained.</p>
<h3>A Few Words About Shortwave Radios</h3>
<p>— Mediocre Words</p>
<p>The reception range of a shortwave radio is truly incomparable to that of a broadcast radio, not even a tenth as good. For example, using an eight- or ten-tube radio to listen to European broadcasts is already quite difficult, and it is limited to evenings without atmospheric interference. Conversely, using an ordinary two-tube shortwave radio, we can confidently listen to shortwave signals from Europe during the day. The superiority of its effectiveness is self-evident.</p>
<p>Throughout the 24 hours of a day, early morning is most suitable for listening to the 16-meter band shortwave signals. Noon is best for the 19-meter band. The 25- and 31-meter bands are best listened to in the late afternoon and dusk. The 50-meter band is most suitable for evening listening.</p>
<p>Adjusting a shortwave radio is indeed more difficult than a broadcast radio. This can be expressed numerically. For example, if we assume that each ten kilocycles per second can accommodate one station, then in the broadcast band from 550 to 1500 kilocycles per second, there are 96 station positions. If the dial is divided into 100 degrees, each station occupies approximately one degree. However, in a shortwave radio, a certain coil can cover wavelengths from about 20 to 50 meters, that is, from 6,000 to 15,000 kilocycles per second, which can accommodate 900 stations. Each degree on the dial must accommodate nine stations. Thus, the space occupied by each station is naturally much narrower. A slight movement of the dial can jump past many stations. Therefore, a slow-motion dial is essential on a shortwave radio, or else so-called "band spreading" equipment should be added.</p>
<p>Which type of shortwave radio is better? Superheterodyne or regenerative? There is currently no definitive answer to this question. According to general opinion, both types perform very well. Superheterodyne radios generally have better selectivity, but they have more components and a more complex structure. Regenerative radios have a simple structure and are easy to make yourself. Therefore, regenerative radios are suitable for self-made shortwave radios.</p>
<p>A regenerative radio without a grid is suitable for use below ten meters. However, above ten meters, due to [missing characters], it is rarely used.</p>
<p>When assembling a shortwave radio, special attention should be paid to the components. Inferior components should never be used, especially in the radio frequency circuit, where only the highest quality products should be used. If you plan to use inferior components for a three-tube radio, it is better to use high-quality components to assemble a two-tube radio, which can achieve better results. If there is a radio frequency amplification stage in the circuit, it should have extremely tight shielding, otherwise the effectiveness will be compromised.</p>
<h3>Introducing a Simple and Easy-to-Make Oscillator</h3>
<p>— Yang Fangzhu</p>
<p>This oscillator was made last winter. Because it is easy to build and suitable for the economic conditions of amateur research, it is helpful in practical applications, so it is specially introduced.</p>
<p>The components used are:</p>
<p>· 0.0005 variable capacitor with dial, 2 and 7/8 inches in diameter, 1 and 1/4 inches long, one Bakelite tube</p>
<p>· Twelve or 01 vacuum tube base</p>
<p>· One 110-volt, 25-watt light bulb or two</p>
<p>· 0.00025 MFD capacitor with 2 MEG grid leak</p>
<p>· Six-foot-long flexible wire with plug</p>
<p>· One 7-inch long and 7-inch high Bakelite panel and base plate each</p>
<p>The coil is wound with No. 30 double-silk-covered copper wire, tightly wound 54 turns, with a separate tap at 27 turns.</p>
<p>The entire machine is assembled as shown in the first diagram, and the circuit is shown in the second diagram. When connecting the wires, be sure to wrap each joint tightly with adhesive tape to avoid electric shock. After the machine is assembled, it can be directly connected to a 110-volt AC/DC power supply. If used with a 220-volt power supply, another light bulb can be added to the dotted line in the second diagram.</p>
<p>When the power plug is inserted into the power outlet, the light bulb should light up as usual. For the 01 tube, only a faint light is sufficient. Do not increase the power of the light bulb, as it will easily break the filament of the 01 tube.</p>
<p>Before using it, you must pre-calibrate its wavelength curve. Use a piece of paper with small squares and write the scale numbers of the oscillator on the side of the paper, from zero to ninety or one hundred and eighty. Place the oscillator near the radio two or three feet away, and turn the radio to receive a known radio station wavelength around 600 kilocycles per second, such as the Shanghai Donglu Radio Station. Then, turn the oscillator until the radio makes a howling sound. You can then mark 640 kilocycles per second in the horizontal grid of the square paper corresponding to the scale number on the oscillator. Repeat the same calibration at 1,000 kilocycles per second and 1,400 kilocycles per second.</p>
<p>Later, if you want to test the sensitivity or selectivity of the radio, you can use this oscillator as a radio station. This device is also accurate when used to calibrate the dual or triple variable capacitors of a T.R.F. radio.</p>

<h3>Happy Mother's Day</h3>
<p>— Xie Ke</p>
<p>The twelfth of this month is Mother's Day. The Shanghai women's community will have an important celebration for this holiday. Here, I would like to express some opinions about this holiday to celebrate Mother's Day.</p>
<p>The important significance of Mother's Day is how to make modern women aware of the meaning of being a modern mother. This meaning is very important. Most modern mothers, especially Chinese mothers, do not yet fully understand the important responsibilities and obligations of being a mother. They only know how to raise their children, and that is their only responsibility. In addition, they do not pay much attention to how to develop children's strengths, preserve their advantages, and eliminate their disadvantages. On the contrary, in traditional Chinese families, especially in old-fashioned families, all the corrupt and outdated old teachings and bad habits have spoiled the originally innocent and lively children. This must be corrected. Furthermore, in wealthy families—especially in Shanghai—children are only raised with habits of arrogance, extravagance, and debauchery, which should also be corrected.</p>
<p>However, to return to the topic, Mother's Day is merely a gathering enthusiastically welcomed and celebrated by a few prominent and influential women leaders in Shanghai. Most mothers, especially those from the lower classes, may not have the opportunity to participate and may not even know that such a thing exists. What can be done about this? The wives of wealthy people can entrust the care of their children to wet nurses and maids, while poor people are truly mothers of a group of suffering children, but they are unable to participate in this grand event. From this, we can see that Mother's Day has not truly penetrated ordinary families, and mothers who are truly doing the work are unable to know their due obligations and responsibilities on this important day.</p>
<h3>Song of the Charcoal Burner</h3>
<p>— Jing Fu</p>
<p>In the beautiful spring valleys, a gentle singing often echoes: "Go to the bird's nest to pick tea!" Like the melodious sounds of tea-picking women's songs, it floats and spreads. Countless villagers all ask about going to Bird's Nest Mountain. Also, in the quiet and solemn deep forests, the music of nature rustles, and the laughing voices of men leap forth: "Go to Bird's Nest to burn charcoal! Charcoal is really valuable." They sing toward the mountain! The towering, bottomless Bird's Nest Mountain used to be the inexhaustible treasure trove passed down through generations for the surrounding villagers. Relying on their strong hands, they labored up Bird's Nest Mountain to pick tea, chop firewood, gather bamboo, and burn charcoal. They could always get food to eat! The villagers all sang this way.</p>
<p>But now, the green mountains remain, but human affairs are completely different. The soft singing of the tea-picking women and the joyful shouts of the men can no longer be heard on the deep, high, and vast Bird's Nest Mountain. Bird's Nest Mountain has become a desolate abyss. The mountain is full of material, but no one comes to collect it anymore. Only the wailing of the wind, like the mournful奏 (zòu, musical performance) day and night, sweeps through the dense forest, a desolate lament!</p>
<p>Turning around the mountain depression, every hundred steps you can see each charcoal kiln, which has been ravaged by wind and rain for a long time, becoming a pile of ruins, ignored by everyone. The only one who remains is the old charcoal burner, A-Fu, who is now considered the only old companion of Bird's Nest Mountain. He still often sees the heartbreaking ruined charcoal kiln sighing and even shedding tears. He used to be the most kind-hearted old man, always with a smile on his face. Every first and fifteenth of the lunar month, he would definitely go to Ha Xi Market to get a haircut. But now, his head is like a messy little mountain depression, with hair and beard scattered all over, revealing a charred face full of terrible wrinkles and blood vessels swelling. Trembling his lips and shaking his neck, he cannot even stand when he thinks of the past. The bottom of his soul can only sing in secret—How will I, this old codger, die? Oh, heavens?</p>
<p>In recent years, the golden land-like foreign countries in Nanyang have changed. The returning foreign guests who can buy charcoal to burn opium, brew tea, and stew pig's feet are pitifully few. The Feng'an Highway has also opened up, and goods can be carried directly on shoulders. The livelihood of the laborers on and near Bird's Nest Mountain who rely on carrying goods to the city, especially the charcoal burners, is even more hopeless. Charcoal is no longer carried by them; carrying it can only be sold at a loss, not even a third of the previous price. Old man A-Fu does not want to think about the heartbreaking past, but the past keeps rushing to his mind. How can he forget it? The old man's only son, that bull-like man, died of vomiting blood because charcoal was worthless and he had to desperately carry heavier loads each time, until he died in less than a year.</p>
<p>The people in the nearby villages are gradually decreasing. Escaping famine, escaping drought, avoiding bandits and avoiding disasters, they all leave one by one in waves. Where are they going! It is truly earth-shattering; they no longer want their hometowns, they can abandon their ancestors. Finding someone to buy charcoal is as difficult as finding an emperor. The tea-picking women on Bird's Nest Mountain have disappeared. The charcoal burners have also abandoned the charcoal kilns passed down through generations, abandoning the trees that used to be treasures, and saying to old man A-Fu: "Let's go, the times are wrong, burning charcoal will only lead to starvation, who wants your charcoal? Go elsewhere to seek a living!" But old man A-Fu can't figure out where to be reborn. How can he abandon the hometown passed down through the hard work of his ancestors? However, the old man now cannot even figure out a way to live. Bird's Nest Mountain seems to be dying. He can now only sing in grief—How will I, this old codger, die?……</p>
<h3>Overnight Stay in Jiangwan</h3>
<p>— Si Quan</p>
<p>Spring, when miscellaneous flowers bloom and trees grow, is the season for traveling in Jiangnan! But—the street sends the cry of a flower seller from Calais, and the signals of summer are displayed on the girls; although you can entrust this unfulfilled hope to the second spring, wasn't it what you hoped for last year? Now the traces of the flying orioles are nowhere to be seen!</p>
<p>On a Saturday night, in a chance encounter, I boarded a tram to Tiantong'an Station. The dim electric lights separated the chaotic night of the city, and I felt that just a day's excursion was enough to fulfill two years of longing. The seats on the train were comfortably arranged, and the wind coming in through the window carried an unknown breath. I rested my heavy head on the back of the chair, lit a mild cigarette, and stared dreamily at the trivial crumbs of tobacco, almost stopping all thoughts. When a whistle sounded in the quiet night room, it stirred my gaze to glance out the window. Trees and houses rushed past backward under the dim streetlights, so quickly, perhaps that was a scenic spot! Thinking of the high-speed movement under the neon lights, who can deny that this is not a trip to Jiangnan!</p>
<p>Friends were waiting for me at Jiangwan Station, and there was also a tall dog who lovingly sniffed my shoetips (perhaps I brought a mixed breath!), barking softly, welcoming me on this shortest distance trip, and rushed ahead to the dark street, acting as a guide for the hospitality of the landlord. Perhaps they did not dream that there was a more free world here when their kind were perched high on cars.</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>The end of the cinder road is the center of Jiangwan. A teahouse was still open, and several rough (naturally also straightforward) locals were squatting on benches with their feet, talking and drinking tea. I guess they were talking about the story of Zhang Tianshi performing magic to pray for rain last year; the early summer sun forced them to recall the scars of the great drought!</p>
<p>Although walking west from the main street, the ground gradually became uneven, and the streetlights were surprisingly dim. The dog suddenly barked wildly in front, and a huge strange shadow fell on the ground, the shadow of a dilapidated house, with a newly built building emphasized in the back. I suddenly recalled the massacre of the Great Slaughter, didn't my friend's house was rebuilt by the gift of war? Well, maybe the tea drinkers squatting on the benches are sadly narrating the tragic image under the fire of imperialism?</p>
<p>Turning into a small path, the lights flashing between the bamboo fences is my friend's home. The streetlights end here to the north, and in front is an endless darkness. The barking of wild dogs is even louder, and I almost suspect that I have entered a magical biography. The friend lightly knocks on the fence gate, and answering the door is a golden-haired dog with a bell hanging, petite and cute, who, upon seeing the owner, runs away without a trace.</p>
<p>Going upstairs and opening the south-facing window, the sky is high, and the stars twinkle with enchanting eyes. They seem to have obtained a free and carefree world, unthreatened by neon lights, and radiate their inherent light. Under her shroud, it is pure and serene, the breeze caresses the trees like pleasant music, and the croaking of frogs harmonizes, making it even more interesting.</p>
<p>The host specially prepared dishes and poured wine for us, and we drank heartily for this warm hospitality. I have already put into practice the Jiangnan travel season! I will always cherish this chance opportunity, even though the girls have already raised the signals of summer on their bodies.</p>
<h3>When the Longan Flowers Bloom</h3>
<p>— Xiao Lin</p>
<p>When the water lilies in the pond are floating with fragrance, when the pomegranates on the wall are bearing pink fruits, when the longan flowers bloom, it is when we keep our deep and solid heartfelt promise.</p>
<p>Now the longan flowers have not only bloomed, but also fallen off, bearing embryos, but why hasn't Lingling in the South sent any news? The heart burdened with thoughts is so depressed! Every day, I seem to have taken away my soul, and I always lean on the window, silently watching the street scene below, waiting with an anxious and eager heart for the green-clad messenger to bring me Lingling's sweet sentences like tangerine juice. But the sky quickly darkens, and I have no choice but to leave the window in disappointment, retreat, and sigh. In this way, one day passes after another, one moment drags on after another, time flies by, and the waiting heart gradually fades, but the feeling of longing for Lingling actually increases. For Lingling has made me bear too much love. She once made my heart lake ripple with boundless waves. In my wandering mind, on the lonely and distant journey, Lingling is the last oasis of my long journey. Although my body and Lingling's body are separated by overlapping mountains and overlapping seas, the overlapping mountains and seas cannot stop the secret agreement of two hearts. I cannot be without Lingling on the other side of the sea to give me endless spiritual nourishment, just as Lingling needs my longing on this side of the sea. I still remember deeply when that farewell time, it was a night, there was no moon in the sky, it was heavy, only a few stars were looking forward with their eyes, Lingling came to the riverbank to see me off, the waves rushed up one after another, crashing against the ship's side and then receding, the wind was cold, I stared at the boundless dark sea, thinking that I would let this ship carry me floating away, why should I leave you like this? I said with a trembling throat, and in that situation, I couldn't help but feel a little lost. Lingling heard my words, raised her head and looked at me charmingly, held my left hand and said: "Time will pass easily, when the longan flowers bloom, we can meet again."</p>
<p>"When the longan flowers bloom" Lingling, during these long days, I never stopped chanting this signal you chanted. Spring was revealed to the world in the swaying willows. Then summer came in the noisy cicada chirping. Lingling, the longan flowers have bloomed three times, and fruited three times. It is impossible to see the longan tree in the North, I imagine that the early-blooming longan in the South Island should be full of white flowers.</p>
<p>And when will our heartfelt promise bear fruit, Lingling. You wouldn't see that golden oath as light as smoke, would you? It's hard for me to predict this, but after three long years, there is no news. During those same lonely days, you might not be able to withstand the erosion of loneliness and changed your mind, tearing up the golden oath. I had already heard from friends that you had remarried. And you have come to the North for your honeymoon trip, I never believe it, although I have tried to find out, I can never find out the truth.</p>
<p>The dream that I treasured and fostered for three years has been shattered, what else am I thinking about? The arduous journey of a wanderer is ultimately arduous. I can be regarded as unloading a heavy burden from my mind, so that I can begin my eternal wandering.</p>
<h3>Dongda Pond</h3>
<p>— Chen Li'ang</p>
<p>Although it has been a year, I still recognize the road, one bay after another, one bridge after another. The road is spread out beside the stream, and the road is twisted like earthworms, lying quietly at the end of the wheat field. The white-hot sunlight near noon is mixed with the clear spring water, flowing through the slender reed stems, flowing through the green and vermilion, uneven stones. With some quiet sounds of wind instruments, with a few tender and weak duckweeds. "Ge Li Xi Li" flowing, flowing... The fate of duckweed is dominated by water.</p>
<p>However, our group walked so slowly, like duckweeds, rippling in the warm and gentle air. I browsed the various scenery along the way with a lonely mood, the tall and slender pine trees standing in the ancient tomb ruins, symbolizing an unyielding husband? Symbolizing a woman's waist? Symbolizing an old man's wrinkled arms? "Oh, that solitary one, didn't I leave a photo of it last year, doesn't it still seem to recognize me and smile and nod?" I thought to myself silently, if plants have spirituality and intelligence, it must say, "Friend, how did you become so thin and withered, you are so different from last year, you...?"</p>
<p>Yes, it was only a short period of time, and the environment has changed, life has changed, the heart has changed, and the appearance has also changed. Although the few friends around me are still the same, Miss Peili is still in that naive posture, picking a few purple wildflowers from the stream and smilingly pinning them on my lapel, then running ahead with jumps and bounds, and I, I can only stare wide with moist eyes, watching her back, including the gratitude in a bitter smile. "You should bring some spirit to such good weather!" Mei Xue turned his head and shouted a sentence.</p>
<p>As if waking up from a shallow dream. I am walking on the stone bank of Dongda Pond, the leaves of the willow are as wide as small fish, sparsely floating on the surface of the water, some breeze is mixed with some breath of green grass, slightly fluttered, sparking a burst of silver scales on the water, with white light, the water surface without waves is green, the green reflection of tree branches and leaves, the pond water itself has no color, completely relies on the reflection of the surrounding environment, if it is a dark rainy day, it will not call people to miss her.</p>
<p>Dongda Pond is tightly embraced by several mountain peaks, she hides in the greenery, seemingly deliberately trying to avoid the vulgar eyes and ears who are usually tied to sound, color, money and profit. If it is a strange tourist, even the local driver will not recommend this secluded and silent environment. They think the best place to go is the Yuantouzhu, piled up almost into a big rockery, the Liyuan with red railings, the noisy Huishan, and the gray long bridge with sixty-two ring caves that lies like a corpse on the lake. Dongda Pond does not have many stereotypes, vulgarity, noise, and the ugliness of Westernized civilization, so I love this unnoticed place.</p>
<p>Peili and Mei Xue led my friends to climb the mountain, while I was still squatting on the semicircular stone embankment, looking at the yellow wild daffodils in the water, the unnamed dark red grass leaves, although the peach tree is not as bright as in spring, its posture still attracts people's memories and gives rise to the feeling that time flies like water. The mountain trees, each according to their suitable position, stand upright, or bend at the waist, or raise their heads, or make a pouncing posture, to the mountain wind blowing, white clouds leisurely drift from this mountain top to that mountain top. I can't bear to leave this quiet and beautiful natural environment. Peili stood in front of the stone house on the hillside, raising her sharp voice: "Really... will you live in Dongda Pond for the rest of your life?" When I started walking to the foot of the mountain, she picked off the pine flowers and threw them on me.</p>
<h3>The Taste of Being a Master</h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>The moment he stepped through the door, his heart, full of eager anticipation, immediately cooled by half, because he saw his uncle, sitting in the living room, clearly glancing at him as he entered! But then he turned his gaze away, engrossed in conversation with the guest. Perhaps it was a momentary oversight. To prove the accuracy of this guess, he deliberately made his footsteps louder, but the other party continued his loud chatter, leaving him alone to sit on the cold bench, as if ignoring him, as if he didn't exist there at all. And when an unfamiliar guest stared at him with curious eyes, how unbearable a stimulation that would cause the person being stared at! He endured it like a convict suffering a penalty for a long while. Finally, the guests left one after another, leaving only the two of them.</p>
<p>Seeing the guests off, the uncle turned around and walked back, as if only now discovering him, nodding slightly, and then coldly asking:</p>
<p>"What do you want?" Compared to his energetic demeanor earlier, he was completely different, like two different people.</p>
<p>Thinking: You only come when you need something? Can't I visit you if I don't have anything? Why are you saying such things and behaving in such a way? He almost couldn't believe that the person standing in front of him was his uncle.</p>
<p>He almost lost the courage to speak, and stood there in a daze.</p>
<p>And so they sat in silence, the uncle puffing on his cigar, his mouth tightly sealed as if never to open again. He glanced sideways at his uncle's face, which looked like it had been hammered out of iron, and felt a chill and then a burning sensation. They endured this silence for some time, and the uncle yawned a few times with an expression of impatience, stood up, and seemed ready to leave.</p>
<p>He had to quickly stammer:</p>
<p>"Uncle, in a few days, we're holding the seventieth-year memorial service for Dad, and we need to put your name as the uncle on the invitations. I'm letting you know." He thought that this matter only needed to be announced, and given their close family relationship, his uncle would surely agree and would have a duty to do so, especially since it didn't require any effort or exertion.</p>
<p>However, upon hearing his words, his uncle frowned, clearly showing a reluctance that didn't need explaining, pacing back and forth as if contemplating a difficult matter. After a long while, he said:</p>
<p>"It would be good, but..."</p>
<p>"But what, Uncle? Tell me," he asked anxiously.</p>
<p>"I think it would be best not to use my name."</p>
<p>He understood that his uncle was deliberately shirking his responsibility, even treating him like an outsider.</p>
<p>All of this made him feel surprised and perplexed.</p>
<p>However, he knew that not having his uncle's name would mean less in terms of monetary gifts, leveraging his uncle's social standing. He never expected that his uncle, who should have been doing something both possible and necessary, would refuse.</p>
<p>"Uncle, no matter what, your name is indispensable. Dad is gone. Besides you, who else has this status?"</p>
<p>His tone gradually became one of pleading for help. But no matter how gently he spoke, his uncle maintained a firm refusal, with no room for discussion. The uncle, feeling completely annoyed by the nagging, flared up:</p>
<p>"I said I can't use it, and I can't use it. Don't you dare say another word!"</p>
<p>His expression had become completely stiff. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Movie News</p>
<h3>Tianyi World</h3>
<p>Wang Bin is currently working diligently on his new work.</p>
<p>Shen Yongshi took many panoramic shots of West Lake from an airplane.</p>
<p>Yesterday, many male and female students from the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts and the China Middle School visited Tianyi.</p>
<p>Tianyi's new film "Reunion" will be released at the Central Grand Theater starting on the 12th.</p>
<p>Chen Jingfang plays a major role in "Mother." Zuo Ming expressed great approval of the concept of a mother.</p>
<h3>Songs in "Boat Girl"</h3>
<p>The three songs in Shen Xiling's self-written and directed new work, "Boat Girl," are all extremely moving. The most profound and touching one is "Goddess," sung by Hu Jia and composed by He Luting. Here is a special introduction to its moving lyrics:</p>
<p>Today, only today,</p>
<p>Can I still endure the torment of suffering,</p>
<p>Tomorrow, oh, tomorrow,</p>
<p>My voice is broken,</p>
<p>My flesh rotted,</p>
<p>Then I'll be useless coal ash,</p>
<p>Abandoned in the lonely wilderness.</p>
<p>Born of the same parents,</p>
<p>Yet there's a division of wealth and poverty,</p>
<p>The rich enjoy all the glory and fortune,</p>
<p>The poor sell themselves into brothels,</p>
<p>Endless beatings, scoldings, hunger, and cold,</p>
<p>Endless insults and devastation,</p>
<p>Think of my hoarse voice,</p>
<p>Think of my ruined flesh,</p>
<p>Used to entice those rich and bored men,</p>
<p>To earn unjust money for that greedy madam.</p>
<h3>"Children of the Storm" to be Released Soon</h3>
<p>The fully sound, dialogue-driven, singing-filled new film "Children of the Storm," produced by Diantong, has been completely filmed and will be released at the Jincheng after "National Customs."</p>
<p>Although Xu Xingzhi's direction of "Children of the Storm" is his debut, he has grasped the actions of all the actors and the complexity of the plot. Even in the preview clips, he has been able to fully control the audience's psychology. A-Feng, played by Wang Renmei, cries because her parents were swept away by the tides of unemployment and poverty, feeling like her own life is adrift; Mrs. C, played by Tan Ying, with her enchanting posture and luxurious decorations, uses a snake-like seduction on people; the heroic death of Gu Menghu in resisting the enemy, and Yuan Muzhi's abandoning his pen to join the army, further demonstrate the magnificence of the Chinese nation's roar. The content can be described as substantial and great. With Xu Xingzhi's directorial skills, which are rich in artistic and literary cultivation, the visual richness and beauty are expected.</p>
<h3>Happy Forest Silver Floss</h3>
<p>Our "Little Aunt"</p>
<p>Our "Little Aunt" is an affectionate and beautiful girl. Her eyes are full of pink dreams. Her beautiful smile, her moving song, she captured the heart of a generous and passionate youth. Love! The flowers of their hearts bloomed! But she is a criminal—her enthusiasm is superfluous!</p>
<p>"Little Aunt," Happy Forest's new work; "Little Aunt" is Xia Peizhen.</p>
<p>Newcomers in "Little Aunt"</p>
<p>Besides the protagonist Luo Jun in "Little Aunt," there are two newcomers:</p>
<p>One is called Yao Ping, a passionate youth who grew up in the South, passionately loves the film industry and specially traveled from Southeast Asia to Shanghai; the other is a woman named Wu Yin, who played a principal once in the new "New Woman," and "Little Aunt" is her sound debut.</p>
<p>Director and Lead Actress</p>
<p>Min Qian, the director of "Little Aunt," modestly said, "The success of 'Little Aunt' is thanks to the efforts of several lead actors." But Ying Yin, the lead actress, said, "The gains in 'Little Aunt' are thanks to the director's help."</p>
<p>A pair of artists who love to be modest!</p>
<h3>"China Electric" Mailing</h3>
<p>Our association will hold its third regular meeting at the New Asia Cantonese Restaurant on Nanjing Road at 2:00 PM this Sunday (the 12th). We hope that all founders will attend on time. The Chinese Film Society</p>
<p>"Epic of Conquering the Skies" starring Hares Huang Lai, released in Nanjing.</p>
