<h3>國貨工廠事業這策進</h3>
<p>— 柳</p>
<p>近上海市社會局爲求國貨商塲組織之嚴密。規定管理辦法。凡在本市舉辦或徵集本市廠商赴外埠舉辦國貨臨時商塲或國貨展覽會者。皆須赴局登記。並訂有規則。違者取締。國貨廠商各團體。則以國貨團體組織。尚無單行法規。而致組織散漫。行動不一。影響於事業之進行。爰於今日（十六）開會。備向六中全會請願頒訂。是二者皆國貨工廠事業改進之發軔也。</p>
<p>年來國貨商塲（包括國貨展覽國貨運動等在內）層見疊出。一市之內。東西南北。同時並起。一國之內。甲省乙埠。分地舉行。幾成爲「趕集化」「廟會化」。然因是而深入民間。亦可喜之現象也。惟各廠爲競銷故。價則日求其廉。物則不嫌其窳。形式美麗而不經用。物名相同而質懸殊。則又自取失敗之道矣蓋各地手工業。旣爲洋貨所摧殘。復受國貨工廠業之打擊。若國貨工廠之出品。能適應民間之需要。猶是楚弓楚得。利不外溢。如其不然。適爲洋貨作反宣傳。而加强民間購買洋貨之心理耳。失物有精粗。價有貴賤。原不能相期一律。但其等級差別之間。不應無相當之準則。一物之經用與否。能如其所費之代價與否。此較之下。優劣立判。如價賤而不經用。與價較貴而耐用。自不待勸告。將捨前者而取後者矣。故製物定價。須兼顧用戶之經濟以作打算。則其銷路方可久長。若單恃宣傳之力。不惜言過其實。誇張異常。及至所試皆非。不第有失宣傳之效力。亦且招致買戶之反戚。此後卽有良品。人亦不信。國貨工廠爲前途計。宜善護國貨二字之光榮。尤須注重國貨之眞實。以洋貨冒充國貨。朦混顧客。固所不取。卽意在顧客一次嘗試爲已足。亦豈是正辦。至若假借推行國貨之名義。作一己名利之收穫。以及組織不良。辦理不當。貽顧客以惡劣之印象。參加廠商以無謂之損失。自非主管官署切實監督嚴加取締不爲功也。</p>
<p>至國貨工廠目前最大之困難。仍爲洋貨之壓迫。提高進口稅。旣不能杜洋貨之傾銷。反足以增加洋商就地設廠之競爭。現在多數繁銷之洋貨。在上海卽無獨立製造之廠。亦有配製之工塲。我國貨工廠所有之便利。旣與彼共之。且彼技術純熟。經營擅長。遠非國貨工廠所能跂及。復有特殊勢力爲之作後盾。駸駸乎國貨工廠亦將與手工業同其命運矣。我國貨工廠業知處境之危險。統一陣綫。齊一步驟。以禦外來之侵鑠。求內部之團結。誠屬切要。此而不能。遑論工業之統制乎。</p>

<p>（廣州）今日據此間中日當局聲稱、汕頭交涉、日內可望和平解决、路透電社探悉外間所傳日海軍當局已以哀的美敦書致汕頭地方官之謠言、實無根據、且聞汕頭日領事與該處市政府之談判、日來進行頗爲順利、不致發生意外事變、今晚此間中日當局均有安慰人心之聲明、於是民衆爲之大慰、廣州日總領事河合今日午後啟程赴香港、擬到滬參加會議、（十五日路透電）</p>

<p>（香港）此間外國頒事官員聲稱、美艦阿煦維爾號昨日奉命開往汕頭、實因汕頭中日交涉吃緊之故、聞今日午後、英軍艦一艘亦將由此赴汕、惟英海軍當局不願發表任何消息、謠傳日海軍當局已以哀的美敦書致汕頭地方官、謂中國海關如不停征日本與台灣白米特稅、則日海軍陸戰隊將於明日登陸、日人指此稅違背現有絛約、（十五日路透電）</p>
<p>（廣州）據負責方面消息、汕頭局勢現仍吃緊、中國當局拒絕承認日本所提出停征日毫食米特稅之要求、據某要人聲稱、昨日美艦阿煦維爾號之啟行、初非奉命赴汕、願係出發後始接命令、領事宮員隱示該艦之赴汕、得傳發消息故也、（十五日路透電）</p>

<h3>巴黎文獻進行　和解新外交行動　賴伐爾與英意駐使晤談　請意提出休戰最低條件　敎皇代表願居間任斡旋</h3>
<p>（巴黎）法國總理兼外長賴伐爾、今日曾與英國大使克拉克·意國大使塞路悌及敎皇代表麥里昂會晤、以謀再事進行世界和平之新努力、並悉英國已允於十日內不向國聯要求實施更嚴厲之制裁、以待意相墨索里尼之答覆、聞賴伐爾已要求墨索里尼說明其可以接受之最低限度休戰條件、並悉麥氏亦已睛求敎皇、力促墨氏接受和平解决之辦法云、（十五日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）法總理賴伐爾昨與英意兩國大使談話之內容、現尚無確訊、惟法人方面承認賴氏現採行和解之外交行動、事關秘密、據法報所載賴氏刻待墨索里尼至低條件之說之無從蹬實、賴伐爾發起和解之訊、已引起羅馬人士之滿意、但意官塲關於此事之消息、則尚寂然無聞、衆信意國將竭力贊助可與其尊嚴適合之解决、同時羅馬已接到參謀總長巴杜格寥大將已抵瑪薩華之報告、（十五日路透電）</p>
<h3>和平解决爭端　英意意見懸隔　英國堅持原計劃　意大利决難接受</h3>
<p>（羅馬）關於意阿爭端和平解决問題、一般人以爲英意兩國之間頗難覓獲折衷辦法、至少在目前恐無互相接扳之可能、緣意大利對於阿國邊境區域、仍主張由該國委任統治、英國則堅持僅可委託統治一小部分、并以阿國獲有通海道路爲交換條件、關於此一問題、意國雖未提出何項計劃、該國外交界人士雖一再聲明該國政府無意提出此項計劃、但以該國各報所載、與該國出席國聯會總代表阿洛錫所發表之演說、曁向美國人民所作之廣播演說而論、則意國見解不外下開各項、卽（一）意國對於和平解决一層并不加以拒絕、（二）阿國領土必須分爲兩部份、一爲該國本部領土、一爲該國近數十年所兼併之省區、而意國在國聯會成立之前、已與該國訂有條約、自當在此等省區享受特殊權利、（三）國聯會盟約如能出以較爲適當之解釋、自可與現行局勢相融洽云、日本駐意大使杉村曾擬有一項計劃、主張阿國邊境各省區當由意國委任統治、其本部領土則由國聯會委任統治、此項計劃、意國方面當可伽以接受、此間政界人士以爲國聯會盟約第二十二條雖僅規定戰敗國卽德奧等國之殖民地、得採用委任統治制、但不妨將其適用範圍加以擴大、并謂阿國在實際上、已在外國顧問監護之下、該國亦曾自行聲明、對於國聯會之援助、凡可以促進該國政治經濟程度者、均準備加以接受、然則意國對於阿國邊境省區所可探用之委任統治制、自屬於「乙種委任統治」、（見國聯會盟約第二十二條第五項）換言之、卽意國在此種委任統治地、不得自由設置陸軍、果爾、則英國關於該國殖民地克尼亞與埃及蘇丹附近地帶、或在外國管理之下、設置士著軍隊之疑慮、當可渙然冰釋矣、至英國所定計劃、乃該國不管部大臣艾登前於本年五月間聘問羅馬時所提出者、迄今無所變更、卽以阿國沃迦登區域割讓意國、并允許意國在阿國享有經濟特權、而以英屬索謀里蘭境內海口一處、畀予阿國、曾由意國加以拒絕、其理由爲（一）沃迦登區域係屬沙漠地、（二）所謂經濟特權殊不可靠、此與阿國依照一九二八年意阿兩國友誼條約所畀予意國之特權有何區別、（三）若以通海道路畀予阿國、自可屬使該國擴充軍備、其對於東菲洲意國地之威脅、亦卽爲之擴大、意國對於此項主張、東菲洲戰事尚未開始之前、卽已加以拒絕、此際旣在阿國境內佔據若干地段、自更難予接受、何况英國前已聲明、在意國軍隊徹退阿國之前、至少在軍事行動停止之前、當拒絕進行談判、此在意國則謂談判先决條件、乃在中止制裁手段、雙方見解參差若是、安有希望可言、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英財相表示　談判之門未閉　應付危難早自爲計　國防程序非爲侵略</h3>
<p>（倫敦）財相張伯倫今日在格拉斯哥演說、謂英政府前曾聲明如意國對於意阿爭議不訴諸武力、則英國願助意國償其合法之奢願、卽在今日、意國業已開戰、英國從未取銷此言、吾人殊不欲關閉在不多時前對意開啟之門戶、機述及總選舉展至明春舉行之建議、財相詢衆曰、吾大有權可謂危難至明春卽可過去乎、愼勿自誤、當知吾人今非處於危難之終期、實處於或將爲艱困疑懼長久時代之起點、在此時代中、最嚴重性質之危難、或復發生、財相次述及英國之國防程序、切實聲明非欲作侵略之用、其言曰、吾人所經營者、乃求達目的所必要之絕對至小程度、過此不欲再進、吾人圖獲軍縮一般妥協之努力、並不稍弛云、（十四日路透電）</p>
<h3>國聯調整委會通過　財政制裁方案　匈奧代表棄權</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯大會制裁方案調整委員會（以後簡稱制裁委員會）、於本日午後六時舉行全體會議、國聯各會員國除意阿當事國外、五十三國代表全體出席、會議歷時甚短、當經一致通過十八國委員會所起草之財政制裁方案、該案投票表决以前、匈牙利代表尼克爾宣稱、匈牙利爲債務國、與財政制裁無關、故放棄表决權、奧國代表希勒亦作同樣之陳述、烏拉圭及委內瑞拉兩國代表則聲明須向各該國政府請訓、又阿根廷代表格拉齊宣稱、「阿根廷當投票贊成財政制裁方案、但有應聲明者、阿根廷境內有意國僑民百萬人、故該案中一部分條欵、阿根廷政府頗覺窒礙難行、此層應請制裁委員會予以考慮」云、至是制裁委員會遂將對意財政制裁方案表决通過、</p>
<p>法國建議四項</p>
<p>制裁委員會繼又通過法國代表團所提出之動議案、該動議案建議下列四項、（一）十八國小組委員會、應立卽研究禁止軍事上所用各項原料品及制成品對意輸出、並停止意國貨物輸入、國聯會員國之實施方案、此種方案應特設一股員會以研究之、（二）十八國小組委員會應同時研究按照盟約第十六條第三節規定、國聯會員國經濟相互援助之實施方案、此項方案應另設一股員會以研究之、（三）十八國小組委員會應要求以上兩股員會、儘速進行其工作、（四）以上兩股員會應各別起草具體方案、提出十八國委員會、由十八國委員會提交制裁委員會通過執行之、</p>
<p>指派兩股員會</p>
<p>上列動議案經制裁委員會通過後、當卽指派兩股員會、（一）經濟制裁股員會、包含葡萄牙·法國·蘇聯·波蘭：西班牙·加拿大·荷蘭·瑞典·瑞士·阿根廷·比利時·土耳其·羅馬尼亞·墨西哥·等十四國、（二）經濟互助股員會、包含葡萄牙·法國·蘇聯·波蘭·西班牙·南菲聯邦·希臘·羅馬尼亞·南斯拉夫·等九國、是爲本日制裁委員會全體會議之結果、按自制裁委員會成立以後、數日間卽已完成禁運軍火及財政制裁之兩大步驟、今復開始對於經濟制裁之工作、就其工作進行之迅速敏捷、實開國聯會歷史中未有之先例、因此若干政界人士深感制裁委員會倘循此種速率、繼續進展、則將來國聯會或竟成爲爭　之工具、亦未可知也、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）西班牙代表康託斯今日被舉爲經濟互助委員會主席、此委員會將設法减輕若干國因參加對意實施經濟制裁而發生之犧牲、康託斯於說明此委員會之目的時、聲明未有若干國可從他國獲取賠償之意、謂吾人皆須犧牲、以期恢復和平、和平所需之犧牲、較戰爭所需者爲少、但遵從國聯盟約第十六條、吾人必須有一種協定、庶减輕損失與不便利云、該委員會决定製成意國對外貿易之統計、而提交於明日會議、（十五日路透社電）</p>
<p>制裁方案全文</p>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯大會制裁委員會、於今晚通過根據盟約第十六條對意實施財政制裁之方案、其全文如下、</p>
<p>爲謀國聯會員國履行盟約第十六條所規定義務之便利起見、茲特通過下列各項措置、</p>
<p>（一）聯各會員國政府應立卽採取各項步驟、以使下開各項交易往來、一槪禁絕、（甲）以借欵直接或間接供給意國政府、及認購由意國政府在國內或國外直接或間接發行之債券、（乙）直接或間接貸與意國政府之各項銀行放欵及其他性質之放欵、並以墊欵或其他方式、履行直接或間接對意國政府貸欵之契約、（丙）直接或間接以借欵供給在意國頒土內之公共機關自然人及法人、並認購其在意國國內或國外發行之債券、（丁）以銀行放欵及其他性質之放欵、直接或間接貸與意國境內之自然人與法人、並以墊欵或其他方式、履行直接或間接貸欵於此等自然人與法人之契約、（戊）代意國境內之公共機關自然人與法人發行股票、或認購其在意國國內或國外所發行之股票、或任何種類之資本、</p>
<p>（二）國聯各會員國政府相約禁絕上開甲項至戊項之各種交易、無論由本國人經營、或由他國人居間從事此種交易、均在禁止之列、</p>
<p>（三）聯各會員國政府請各在最短時期內、以按照上述條欵所採取之措置、通知國聯會秘書處（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>計畫頗爲週密</p>
<p>（日內瓦）財政制裁事之有進步、乃財政小組委員會主席希臘代表馬克齊摩斯與法國技術專家古蘭德努力所致、馬克齊摩斯氏在十八人委員會開會時處理財政議案、精幹而又迅速、謂衆决議案至爲週密、凡直接間接對意政府之任何可能的形式中之放欵或財政業務、殆無一不包括在內、（十五日路透電）</p>
<p>本月內可實施</p>
<p>制裁委員會今日午後將再集議、如能維持目前之進步、則在本週杪前可决定一切、衆望財政制裁或可在十月三十一日左右實施、（十五日路透電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）英國代表建議、以十月三十一日爲國聯會員國政府批准對意實施財政及經濟制裁之最後日期、此議今日業經十八國委員會通過、按事前南美代表曾稱、會員國對於其代表在日內瓦之行動、必須由各該國國會批准、且國聯委員會之决議、亦並不能强制各國實行、故英國遂有此建議、（十四日國民電）</p>
<h3>蘇聯代表主張　爲制裁國闢新市塲</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）蘇聯代表波丹金於制裁處理委員會討論經濟制裁問題時力稱、制裁須行之堅决有效、且須普遍、否則無效、波氏述及若干國家將不參加制裁、若干國家甚至拒絕參加、彼復表示願請美國政府禁止若干商品（卽由羅斯福總統所定表格規定者）之輸出、至於對付拒絕參加制裁之國家、則如能限制此等國家之必要借欵至最少限度、並限制對此等國家輸入用於軍事工業之物品、不亦善乎、至於因實施經濟制裁而蒙損朱之國家、則應設法按照比例分配此種損失、或爲此等國家開放新市塲云、（十四日塔斯電）</p>
<h3>日本積極對華　對意阿爭議取靜觀</h3>
<p>（東京）駐日意國大使奧利琪今日上午十一時三十分至外務省訪問重光次官、聽取國聯之議事經過後、探詢日本關於國聯對意經濟制裁之意見、並聽取李滋羅斯在華之活動情形與日本之新對華政策、會見歷三十分鐘後辭出、（十五日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）今日意大利大使於會晤重光次官時、探詢日本對於國聯對意經濟制裁之態度、重光次官似曾言明如下、日本關於意阿紛爭之今後發展、當然有重大之關心、惟意阿兩國在日本均有密切之友好關係、且因紛爭在於歐洲、故日本並無孰是孰非之意、當初所持之靜觀態度、迄今毫無變更、最近國聯因對貴國實施經濟制裁、傳曾邀請非會員國之日美德等參加其間、然日本毫無所聞、設國聯有邀請日本加入之事實、日本對於國聯內部行動之制裁問題、實無表明態度之必要云、（十五日電通電）</p>
<h3>英保守黨議員　請願政府勿施制裁</h3>
<p>（倫敦）下議院保守黨議員四十名、日前曾舉行會議、并一致議决要求政府不必在國聯會主張施行對意制裁、且亦不必出而參加、蓋恐實施制裁之後、因而引起戰禍故也、各該議員等頃已推舉代表團、并以前任殖民大臣阿米里爲領袖、謁見首相鮑爾溫、請其向人民重行保瞪、凡足以引起戰爭之制裁手段、英國旣不提出建議亦不出而參加（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英比荷　遵守國聯决議　取消對阿軍火禁令</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）英國代表不管都大臣艾登，頃以公文通知國聯會秘書處、謂英國政府按照國聯大會判裁委員會之决議、頃已撤銷對阿國禁運軍火之命令、至於對意國禁運軍火、則仍照現行辦法予以維持云、（十四日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）關於對意實施經濟制裁之效力、頃據負責方面表示、美國禁運出口之貨物、並未包含煤油及原料品在內、倘蘇聯亦採取此種步驟則意國飛機坦克車、戰艦商船所需燃料、勢將無法加以杜絕、且據柏林方面消息、德國似亦不至參加制裁、惟官方人士以爲不論他國態度若何、英國决不變更其目前採取之堅决路綫云、（十四日哈瓦斯）</p>
<p>比京　比利時政府頃已决定遵照十月十一日國聯大會制裁委員會一致通過之建議案、準許發給運往阿比西尼亞之軍火執照、惟對於運往意國之軍火執照則停止發給、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>荷京　據官方宣稱、政府已準備禁止對意國輸出軍火云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>美使向英解釋　美國中立地位</h3>
<p>（倫敦）路透社探悉駐倫敦美大使平漢近近會晤英外相霍爾時、曾對美國中立地位作負責之解釋、第一次會晤、平漢對羅總統十月五日所發表之宣言、（卽聲明任何美人自願與意國或阿國經營交易、須自己冒險爲之）續加釋明、第二次會晤時、霍爾曾對平漢之聲明發表若干意見、惟未詢問日內瓦如於對意制裁有所决定、美國將取何態度、（十五日路透電）</p>
<h3>赫爾重要演說　主國際共同行動　回復和平與繁榮</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）國務總理赫爾今日發播音演說、主張和平與繁榮之三重國際努力、赫爾申請同時施行之國際行動、（一）積極改造國際貿易、（二）逐漸恢復貨幣安固、（三）保障各處所需一切重要原料價格適宜之國際協定、赫爾曰、每一衝突輒留下將來衝突之種耔、此乃事之極顯明者、今欲制服衝突原因、厥在許多國之同時行動云、赫爾所述及之原料與英外相震爾近今所發關於此問題之言論相呼應、足證美國並不反對參加討論、衆視赫爾所發貨幣安固一語、殊關重要、因刻在巴黎之美財長摩甘索昨日曾向新聞訪員聲明美國準備討論貨幣安固與匯兌價格之願意也、摩甘索昨訪法財長、今日又往訪法總理賴伐爾、（十五日路透電）</p>
<h3>美國造艦計畫　添建大小艦艇十九艘　海軍人員增至廿萬人</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）據美國海軍部今日發表之文伴、美國擬於一九三七年　財政年度內建造戰艦一艘、驅逐艦十二艘、潛艇六艘、海軍服務將士將增至二十萬人、美國又擬於一九三六年財政年度內添造海軍輔助艦、如運輸船拖船駁船及軍需船等、（十四日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）美國海軍當局爲努力於太平洋岸之國防强化、計劃在南加尼亞海灣五十浬處之聖克利門島、建築大規模之重要軍事根據地、査聖島不過止爲一岩礁小島、如加以軍事設備、則地位頓增重要、其在太平洋上對於美國之利害、猶如地中海之英國於瑪爾泰塔島、據聞該島已在建築船塢·飛機升降塲·貯藏庫等云、（十五日華聯電）</p>
<h3>關於海軍問題　日本覆文內容　反對英方提案</h3>
<p>（東京）九月二十八日英國政府照會日本提議召開軍縮會議、日本關係各省曾研究對策、最近意見一致、上程於本日閣議後、卽電訓藤井駐英代理大使、其訓電之要旨如下、「日本之方針、在依據不侵略不威脅之原則、謀輕减國民之負担、對依此方針而召集之軍事會議、雖準備參加、但英國此次之提案、與日本之方針並不一致、如短期間之建艦計畫相互實言等、有妨碍一國之自主的軍備實現之虞、且僅質的軍縮之單獨協定、非所以達到眞正之軍縮目的、故對英國政府之提案確表贊成」云、（十五日電通電）</p>
<h3>各國造船統計</h3>
<p>（倫敦）據勞合德季報稱、九月三十日英國與愛爾蘭在建造中之船、共一百十艘、計五三〇·五五四噸、同日各外國在建造中之船、共一百七十八艘、計六六七·四一五噸、共中以德國爲最多、計二六八·三四〇噸、瑞典最少、計八·九〇〇噸、（十五日路透電）</p>

<h3>使用新式殺人利器　意軍深入阿國南境　投毒氣彈死傷綦衆　北路同時亦取攻勢　阿軍念萬集中備戰</h3>
<p>（倫敦）每日郵報基部堤訪員接得沃加登省歐籍工程師電話報告、謂傑洛古比區中之血戰、阿軍已死一萬八千人之多、意軍現已採用一種新毒氣、使阿國軍民皆窒息不能呼吸、而向北狂奔、星期六曾有大戰、在大洛一處、阿國軍民死者已達四千、意方用飛機二百架掩護格拉謝尼將軍之部隊向前進攻、阿軍陣綫中、爆炸彈及毒氣炸彈似雨點而下、飛機攻擊之後，即繼以坦克車、茲意軍南路已深入阿境三十一英里、陣綫已由華爾華爾展至達莫脫、惟阿國後方策應之大軍亦已集中齊齊加·哈拉爾及湯薩各區中約有二十萬人、皆經阿皇嚴令祗准力守高原之邊綫、此項軍隊皆有外籍軍事顧問指導、如土耳其之韋希勃將軍及德國之馮雷木將軍等、現在希比利河流域工作之瑞士工程師報告、有大隊阿軍已渡珠巴河、兼程進發、擬攻入意屬索謀里、以截斷格拉謝尼將軍所部軍隊之交通、據稱、意軍北路司令台波諾將軍上星期三曾親乘飛機、深入阿境數百英里、每日郵報訪員並稱、阿國駐法公使兼國聯首席代表哈華利德已被任爲阿軍總司令哈氏爲唐那基爾部落酋長、據聞卽將由日內瓦起程返國、搬任前敵指揮云、（十五日國民電）</p>
<p>阿京　據今日瑪加爾傳來非官塲之電訊、意軍復在北陣綫取攻勢、意軍用坦克車與鐵甲若干輛在賀翔與阿巴羅（阿杜華東南）間之平原疾進、其進行之速率、使阿國北路指揮西育姆將軍之前鋒爲之驚駭、西育姆將軍現力避與意軍接觸、豫料阿軍將在瑪加爾西北與東北之北之山地抵禦、同時加薩將軍所統大軍二十五萬名之一部分已渡太加斯河、如意軍向瑪加爾進攻、則此路阿軍將威脅意軍之右翼、加薩將軍現與西育姆將軍合作、西育姆將軍日來續得大批援軍之助、惟現不願與意軍作大决戰、刻方向瑪加爾退走、今日有生力軍二萬名由華　哥國抵阿京、後軍抵京者、絡繹不絕、但無許多武器供給之、故阿王或將諭令其中若干歸其故鄉、（十五日路透電）</p>
<h3>北路意軍　鞏固後方陣地　阿杜華通邊境公路完成　參謀總長到達瑪薩華港</h3>
<p>（羅馬）北路意軍陣綫、卽聯絡阿狄格拉阿杜華、阿克森三城者、茲已佈置就緒、俾成爲意軍進攻之根據地、但在參謀總長巴佗格里奧上將尚未到達前綫之前、不致遽行進攻、阿杜華城通至邊境公路、頃已建築完成、第一批運輸卡車、業由後方開抵此城、各軍事專家對於此項工程異常重視、則以意屬伊利特里通往前綫、業有新式公路兩條可用、一條通至阿杜華城、一條通至阿狄格拉城故也、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>羅馬　此間頃接獲意屬伊利特里亞消息、證實參謀總長巴佗格里奧上將業於昨日午後到達瑪薩華港、按該上將係於本月十日由那泊爾利港搭乘比安加瑪諾伯爵號汽船前往東菲洲、今於五日之間、卽抵達瑪薩華港、自必在途中改乘飛機、乃有如是之速、一般人以爲巴佗格里奧上將迅赴前綫、乃係北路意軍再度進攻之徵兆、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>國際貿易局昨發表　上半年國內經濟槪况</h3>
<p>災害頻仍影響農產損失　重　銀根緊迫信用收縮工商不振</p>
<p>申時社云、昨據國際貿易局發表本年上半期我國一般經濟狀况仍未脫離恐慌之境、農產以災害頻仍、損失甚大、工商以物價愈趨低落、工廠商店紛紛停工或倒閉、金融則白銀雖有回流、銀根緊迫仍一如往昔、惟本年政府對挽救金融恐慌以及振興交通實業之各種措施、均次第見諸實行、申時社記者昨晤該局局長何炳賢氏、承發表各情如下、</p>
<p>天災頻仍物產减少</p>
<p>去年我國天災特重、農產品均受損失、本年承上年災禍之餘、春季發生春荒、加以水災風災相繼而來、華北黃河與華南珠江所造成之水災、尤爲嚴重、同時長江亦發生水災、在此種普遍災荒狀態之下、上半年我農作物收成自難望豐稔、小麥除江浙尚佳外、冀魯豫均告歉收、惟自全體言之、上半年麥產種植面積較去年尚約增百分之七、以言米穀則水旱交加、目前雖尚無估計、其產額必受天災影響、棉產據中華棉業統計會第一次估計、產額較上年爲减少、茶葉方面、紅茶產量較好、綠茶頗有遜色、繭產蘇省春期約產繭三十萬部担、浙省可產絲一萬八千担、</p>
<p>工商各業益趨衰落</p>
<p>本年上半期、我工商業益不如前、物價依然跌落、有每况愈下之槪、在此種物價慘落之狀態下、工商業自無法維持、因之工廠停工者比比皆是、商店之宣告淸理者、不一而足、就各業而論、棉紗價均不見佳、尤以紗價之低落、與銷路之遲鈍、爲最堪憂慮、紗廠减工停業、已成空前之險勢、至絲業本年上半期半春季毫無起色、夏季則漸次轉好、歐洲銷路、已有顯著發展、麫粉業起伏不定、實由於我國全融緊縮洋米輸入過多所致、火柴業雖未見振作、但大中華公司等組織六省火柴商聯合營業所、實行產銷合作、未始非好現象、此外實部在三月間成立酒精廠、開國民政府直接舉辦實業之先河、</p>
<p>經濟恐慌金融建設</p>
<p>金融方面、本年承去年白銀流出狂潮之餘、經濟金融恐慌、釀成種種現象、自表面觀察、今年獻歲以來、白銀慚趨平穩、且有回流、但實際上銀根之緊迫、及信用收縮、形勢仍極險惡、金融旣日趨緊迫、銀錢業宣告淸理者、乃迭有所聞、但在本年上半期、我國金融界有數事足以注意、卽全國新設銀行六家、新設分支行六十三家、政府發行一萬萬金融公債、郵儲局進行農村放欵、銀錢業實行匯劃票據集中收解等等、均爲金融恐慌中之金融建設、</p>
<p>上半年中財政槪况</p>
<p>二十四年度我國預算、歲出歲入、均爲九五七·一五四·零零六元、政府本年减去一切不必要之支出、而敎育費外交費建設費實業費、則均有增加、本年度發行公債、爲金融公債一萬萬元、關稅公債一萬萬元、各省市之地方債券已發行者達一千三百萬元、本期中我財政設施中最重要者、爲公佈减低出口稅、擬定所得稅原則、及擬設遺產稅法等、本年度關鹽印花烟酒等稅收入估計、均較上年度减少、而政費與建設費用復日趨增加、故不得不新闢財源、此外則苛雜之繼續廢除與確定縣地方預算之進行、亦爲本年財政設施之犖犖大者云云、</p>

<h3>張覺得淇到滬談　關內外客車不辦聯運</h3>
<p>營業尙佳每年收入二百餘萬　中偽幣制不同我方損失頗大</p>
<p>—雙方在平會議僅討論技術問題—</p>
<p>主辦關內外平瀋通車之東方、旅行社經理張水淇氏、於日前離平搭滬平通車來滬、昨晨抵滬、下榻旅次、大公社記者往謁、當承延見、據談平瀋通車之營業狀况及關內外情形頗詳、茲分誌如下、</p>
<p>營業尙佳　仍有虧折</p>
<p>北寗路通車、自於去年七月一日開始辦理後、當時乘客不多、營業未見起色、惟逐後慚臻佳境、現在乘客頗多、一年收入、計爲二百萬元、惟東方旅行社之開支、每年計九萬餘元、其經費即取之於百分之五票價佣金故以、每年二百萬元之收入計之、當可數衍過去、但旅行社與北寗路局因偽國與中國之幣制市價、並不相等、僞幣一元、僅合華幣七角、因之自平津至瀋陽之乘客、往往先購票至山海關、然後再在山海關購票至僞、此段票價、可以僞幣計算、而自關內至關外乘客、較關外至關內者爲少、故關外所售得之票價、亦較關內爲多、每値結算、北寗路局虧折頗鉅、現已由雙方合予匯兌市價、使華幣與僞幣之市價、得以平衡、此制度實行後、北寗路與旅行社、可無損失矣、</p>
<p>不辦聯運　外傳不確</p>
<p>大公社記者、乃詢以外傳關內外將舉辦聯運之說、不知確否、張謂此事不確、因北寗路局與南滿鐵路之合辦乘客通車、已經頗費手績、况關外日人有國際運輸公司之組織、該公司規模甚大、資本共一千萬元、所有關內外之運貨、大多由該公司代辦、在事實上亦無需要、</p>
<p>在平開會　討論技術</p>
<p>至於此次在平舉行北寗路南滿路雙方代表會議、乃純爲討論現在通車上之技術問題、如退票之手續、賬簿字面之更易、其他小手續之改進、及關內外幣區匯兌之規定等等、雙方出席者、咸爲代表、至於北寗路局長殷同赴平、並非出席該會、乃因北寗路車童訓練所開慕、前往致訓詞者、外間不察、乃誤以爲殷之出席、係參加討論關內外聯運、張氏又謂本人此次來滬、因時間忍促、不及料理、故再返滬、勾當一切、在滬稍留數日、即將北上、</p>

<h3>標準工人</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>我家隔壁的木匠阿五，大家都叫他是「標準工人」的。我起初不大明白這尊稱的由來，後來經我把阿五的生活，做了一次考査以後，才知道這雅號對於阿五是名符其實，一些也不錯的。</p>
<p>原來阿五雖然是個工人，可是他對於生活，很有紀律，什麼時候起來？什麽時候上工？什麽時候休息？什麼時侯睡覺？他都是有一個時間的，除了有特殊情形之外，他是不改變他的生活規律的。他每月的工作所入，也有支配的標準，家用多少？自己零用多少？添置東西多少？儲蓄多少？都是根據支配的標準使用，絲毫不肯浪費一些，因之他的經濟，不會感到拮据，自然，精神上也非常愉快了。</p>
<p>其次，說到阿五的做人，也是怪和氣的，他無論何人，都以客氣待人，因之誰都喜歡跟他做朋友，而他的工作，也因而格外忙碌起來，然而他無論怎樣忙，總是快快活活的做下去，絕對沒有一二句怨恨之聲。</p>
<p>因爲阿五有這樣幾種長處，所以大家都改稱他爲「標準工人」，我認爲這是很對的，因爲木匠阿五的一切，是足以使一般的工人效法的。</p>
<h3>秋魚汛</h3>
<p>— 征雁</p>
<p>在海濱，漁民們到洋裏去捕魚，計分爲四個魚汛時期，作爲出與歸的標準；這就是春·夏·秋·冬的四個時期。現在正是秋天的季侯，也就是秋魚汛開始的當兒；那麽，就來談談關於「秋季魚汛」的：</p>
<p>夏魚汛的末期，漁民們上岸休息沒到幾時；接着就是秋天來臨，於是他們照例又要飄着漁舟，大家到洋裏去捕魚了。然而秋天比不得別的魚汛期裏，能得那樣風平浪靜，安然佈置着漁網捕捉魚類的；整個的秋天，漁舟飄蕩在海洋上面，差不得沒一日不處在風浪顚簸，雨波打擊的氛圍裏。所以漁民的生命，隨時有果魚蝦之腹的危險啊！</p>
<p>秋魚汛裏，漁民們在洋裏所捕的魚，大槪爲　魚·鱗魚·　魚·望潮·鮮蝎·鱗魚……等類。由於秋天海面的潮水，澎漲得比平日高上數后以至於十數倍的緣故，和着氣候漸凉的關係；所以魚的游踪旣飄忽，而也不向上游，因此，捕魚要算在秋魚汛裏是最不易捕的了。漁民們他們在夜問泊宿於海港內的小島邊，或海灘角隅，等到天明，又駛着船到洋裏去；這樣，越一二日至三四日，魚艙裏積魚甚多了，就相率駛向魚埠去求脫貨。但，往往也有在三四日內，捕不到幾尾魚的，風雨之夕，逆浪被風掀得滔天的高，於是有幾艘被阻於海面的不能駛回的漁船，只得在惡勢力的襲擊裏，掙扎着殘餘的生命了！</p>
<p>可是他們雖然這樣涉重洋，不顧生命，爲生活去和風浪搏鬥，而所換得的代價是極其微薄的。</p>
<h3>人比黃花瘦</h3>
<p>— 涓隱</p>
<h3>收債</h3>
<p>— 朱慰萱</p>
<p>大凡S埠的舞女，誰都知道小張的鼎鼎大名，羣以獲小張的一跳以爲榮！</p>
<p>至於小張的所以馳名舞國，也無非靠了他祖上傳下來的數十萬造孽錢財，因之他能日夜的浸沉在紙醉金迷粉紅色的環境中。</p>
<p>因爲他揮金如土，舉止闊綽，自然博得了許多舞女的好感，在勢與財的雙重威脅下，舞女受仙誘惑而失身的，確也不在少數；至於和他有一跳之緣的那更是恒河沙數了！</p>
<p>有限的金錢，終究不禁他過度的揮霍。在短短兩三年的時期裏，數十萬的資產。完全隨着華爾茲勃羅絲的音樂旋律而裝進了舞女袋裏。小張在脚底跳得典質殆盡一無所有之後，就拋棄了家裏的黃臉婆和一個美麗活潑今年才只八歲的小女兒，悄悄地離開了S埠而不知所往了！</p>
<p>從此舞塲裏再也找不到小張的踪跡，在每一個舞女的腦筋中，再也沒有小張的影象了！</p>
<p>十年之後，S埠×大舞塲裏突然出現了一顆亮晶晶的舞星，並且爲當選S埠的舞后：伊的名字叫張玲玲，統計每夜舞票的收入，爲數總在數百以上哩！因之伊雖是一個舞女，倒也居積致富了！</p>
<p>後來據一般熟識的人說：這月入萬金紅極一時的舞女，原來就是從前把數十萬的家財都化在舞塲裏的闊少—小張—嫡嫡親親的女兒。於是一般幽默者的論調，都說：張玲玲是來收伊父親十年前所放的債的；不過這種收債的方法，似乎也不大光明吧？</p>

<h3>古貝斯克球藝風行上海</h3>
<p>— 上海通社</p>
<p>中央運動塲·回力球·鬥拳的叙說</p>
<p>回力球，古時貝斯克人（Bagque）的一種球戲，從西班牙輸入上海不過六年之久，現在已成爲上海最普遍的室內運動之一。</p>
<p>一九二八年之秋，有一個股份公司，名呌中央運動的——法文各Parc　des　Sports英文名Auditorium——是爲了輸入回力球及提倡鬥拳目的而出現。股子招足和會塲構成之後，就從埃及的開羅，維基尼亞的亞歷山大里亞，西班牙的巴塞羅納募集職業回力球家。</p>
<p>古回力球的比賽在一九二九年二月七日顯其第一次景象於中央運動塲的觀衆之前，那晚上有二十四個比賽者參加這塲大啟幕的節目。</p>
<p>競賽速率之高，是回力球最吸引學習者原因之一，但上海的運動象很難去學會它，所以直等到一九三〇年十二月新募的藝者從海外來，球賽方始能殼充分地繼續舉行。</p>
<p>新的回力球家自古巴，巴西，西班牙而來，回力球在上海乃告一定之成功。在一九三一年八月二十日，中央運動塲為募救濟水災捐，表演一塲特別節目，所得純凈的賑濟水災被難者的欵子凡四千元。</p>
<p>一九三二年一月，因閘北中日之戰爆發的緣故，中央運動塲暫時停閉。三月一日，重行開幕；那時候的起賽時間是下午七時，俾觀客們能縠在十點鐘戒嚴時問以前回到家裏。</p>
<p>中央運動塲的總經理兼回力球隊長是鐵沃陶洛（Jauregui　Teodoro），經理是海格（AHaig），幹事及廣告主任兼拳師的介紹者是沙福理斯（T．D．Sofoulis）</p>
<p>鬥拳的比賽時時以雄偉的人身防禦的　藝爲上海觀客的娛樂而出塲，但是吸引力却不大。在過去數年中的多次比賽中，最佳的上海拳師曾獻過他們的本事。</p>
<p>雖然回力球在上海主要的是一種職業運動，但中央運動塲總經理對於業餘運動家鼓勵這種古貝斯克競技亦有相當的成功。時時舉行業餘比賽，並授給優勝者以精美的獎賞。</p>
<p>中央運動塲的背景是一僩强有力的金融家們的集團，以飽維爾（F．Bouvier）爲首領。鮑乃該塲董事部之主席，匯原銀行的經理，及法商賽跑會（跑狗會）的理事。</p>
<p>董事部副主席是貝蘭德拉司（C．Ballaodra），其餘各董事係：素凡乃，沈長賡，白包德，尼可爾，及也可維里未。喬治係監察人。</p>

<p>待到太后的身上和兩臀全部擦遍肥皂之後，第一步的工作便算完了：那四名宮女就將手內的毛巾一起棄掉，另外各自檢起不一條新毛巾來，同樣先在溫水內浸了一浸，再撈起絞乾。這一次却不再塗抹肥皂了，而且也比較絞得濕一些，這一步的手續是要給太后擦　方才塗上去的肥皂和已給肥皂擦下來的汚垢，所以揩擦的時間也比較長久一些。待這一次擦好，還得來一次最後的乾揩，那是另外又掉過四條手巾的。</p>
<p>這樣經過了三次的擦抹，太后的上身當然已是很潔凈了，但事情還不止如此簡單咧！那四名宮女一放下了最後一次的毛巾，便忙着取過一缸已溫熱的耐冬花露來，—便是太后每晚塗在臉上的東西—用四團純白的絲棉，飽醮了花露，不惜工本地望太后身上塗去；待各處全塗　了，再另外拿四條乾凈的毛巾來，給伊輕輕的拍乾。這眞是多麽費事的玩意兒啊！</p>
<p>擦洗的工夫做到這一步，自然是至矣盡矣了；第二步便是給太后去取過了一套潔掙的睡衣睡袴來，先將睡衣替伊穿好，這樣便可使伊的上身不致受寒了。接着裏由太后自己把襯袴卸下，一直裸到脚尖，下半個身子便全部顯露了；於是另有四個專任粗工作的宮女，得到了裏面的四個宮女的暗號，抬進了另外一隻浴盆來，這盆一般也是木質而包着銀皮的。（四三六）</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第二十回　掙命看矯孫抱頭落淚荒年　往事種麥招殃</p>
<p>那老太太抖顫着身體，突然伸出兩手，合了掌向志前亂拜着道：程老爺……你你救苦救難，你……救了我……我一條命了。志前對於這朱家南　飄零的婦人，雖沒有什麼感情，可是看了他這種可憐的樣子，心裏一番凄楚，也不覺得兩行眼淚，爲何只管要流了下來，便掉過臉來，反着手向他們述述的招了手，叫着道：你們都隨了我來。走了幾步路，才停住了脚，回頭來望着。因爲由心裏頭冲出來的那股子酸氣，在幾步路的工夫，已經忍了下去了，於是乎那要落下來的兩行眼淚」也就不靑流出來，可以見人了。這時，那老太太一股精神，也不知道由那裏來的，並不用得要人攙着，只手扶了朱胡氏一雙手臂，就跟着走了過來。那胡嫂子便在後面左藏右躱的，只是維護着他。他口裏可道：不不……不要緊的嗎？不要我那月其，爲了這事是什麽連累吧？志前挺了胸道：不要緊，天大的事，我都和你擔着擔子。說着，只管慢慢的在前面引路。到了賈多才房門前，志前叫道：賈太太，你出來看，你……月英正在房門邊伸頭一望，看到老太太，向前飛奔了過來，喊道：我的奶奶，只這一句，他已跑到了老太太面前，兩雙手抓了老太太的衣襟只館亂搖　着。以下，他說不出一個字，只是哭。（三四〇）</p>

<h3>論文明</h3>
<p>— 禾金</p>
<p>赤松明子在一篇論兩性問題的文章中，在闡明了原始時代的兩性間結合的自由與關係的對等之後，接着便爲下了那麽一句話：</p>
<p>「降而到了文明的時代……所謂兩性關係的，就完全陷入了支配者的男子對被支配者的女子的奴隸的關係中去，這之間，人間的關係是一點都不存在的了。」</p>
<p>原作者因爲所論到的是兩性問題，所以對於所謂「文明」這一件外套的闡明，也祇是限於兩性問題的範圍中，因而對現在我們大家在口頭上，在文字上，尤其是被當作特種工具的裝飾上所使用的「文明」這兩個字，是依舊相當地留了一點情面的；然而在我們，這句話已經顯得多麽有用了啊：「降而到了文明的時代……人間的關係是一點都不存在的了」！</p>
<p>「文明」這二個字在中國時髦起來，在我們這一代看，好像還不算得長久；科舉廢掉之後，「新學堂」裏的學生，雖然辮子拖得老長，可是在作文卷子上也喜歡寫點「今天文明之世……」等等了；在西洋，「文明」是被當作某一種人類的傳家之寶在那裏「就便」做一點什麽「偉犬的事業」的。直到現在，一方面喊文明，一方面騎在別人身上的，或甚至在下面做個把「小馬夫」吶喊都忙的，不是依舊多得緊嗎？然而那種人，却是决不會說出「而到了文明的時代，人間的關係是一點都不存在的了。」來的；他們必定說：「現在的時代是越弄越文明了，所以文明人必需要去敎育野蠻人。」</p>
<p>然而這「敎育」的方法究竟是怎樣的呢？劉易士（Sinclas　Lewis）在他底一本呌做「安·維克絲」的小說中寫下了那麽一句：</p>
<p>「砰，砰，砰！」他（指哥侖布—筆者）打倒了他們（美洲的紅種人—筆着）來把歐洲的文化介紹到原始的美洲去。」</p>
<p>諸如此類。</p>
<p>這「教育」的方法當然是絕頂聰明的。『文明』這兩個字，於是也就成爲要去敎育那些「野蠻人」的「敎師」們所頂得用的東西了—不過這「得用」的効果倒也並不見得怎樣的偉大，因爲那班「野人」的腦筋縱然簡單，他們看到了「個炸彈落下來，死在它下面的並不是「文朋」人們自己—這當然是値得欽佩的—而當向下」看：死掉的都是些婦人與孩子；向上一看，却找到了「文明」人在雲端裏翔翔自得的當兒，他們竟也會呆住，而且是「越想越糊塗」了！他們並沒有看見所謂「文明」，他們看見的祇是：「人間的關係是一點都不存在的了。」</p>
<p>實際上這種文明的教育法已經並不是新發明，反之，簡直是「一折八扣」的翻印的古書了。</p>
<p>那麽「文明」便眞是那麽一種要不得的東西了嗎？其實倒也不必那麽說的；如果拿「文明」來跟錢幣比方（比方得多麼「市儈」氣啊，）那末我們可以說；現在市面上通行的都是一批無聊流氓專爲圖利而私造出來的「銅洋鈿」，好的洋錢當然是有的，我們正不必爲了騙人的「銅洋鈿」而連好的洋鈿都不要了。爲今的法子，祇有一面學學「烟紙店」與「兌換鋪」的老闆們的樣，把市上看得到的「銅洋鈿」大家用釘子釘上一個二面穿透的洞！表示以後概不通用，表示這是騙人的東西（這在那些製造僞幣的流氓，當然是大不高興的）而另一方面呢，儘可能的去我尋眞正的好洋鈿，不過好洋鈿的產生是不容易的，不但因爲它需要許多勞苦的工程，而最要緊的，更需要一個配成色的技師與檢騐師的無私與眞誠的好意。</p>
<h3>五四運動的我見</h3>
<p>— 市隱</p>
<p>前幾天曹聚仁君曾發表五四的霉菌一文，結論呌人重視五四運動時代意義，不要看重那幾個滿身霉菌時勢所造成的英雄。隨後又有羊棗君做五四運動實情一長篇，大意乃表明當時運動中心人物的純潔，與曹君旨趣稍殊。以我看來，曹君重視五四整個的立論，吾儕固然毫無異議。但是當時運動中心人物的放僻邪侈，以及賣身投靠等等把戲，端倪已露，也是無可諱言的。然而以高尚純潔的學生諸君，做了一個驚人的還動，何以竟演成如此怪現象呢？曹君尚未加以說明，現在把我的意見約略寫在下面：</p>
<p>大凡歷史演進，是跟着社會變化階段走的。歷史上一件重、要事件的發生，或一階級之輿起或消滅，都與當時文化·經濟·政治·以及國勢强弱，外族仗侮，有密切的關係。表面上是少數人所左右，實際是多數人所需求。換句話說，就是適應時勢以產生的。石破天　的五四運動，當然不能例外。做五四運動的是甚麼人？是學生，即智識階級，即吾國歷代相倘所謂士的階級。吾國自對建初期後士即居優越地位。士以上呌大夫，再上爲諸侯天子，最下爲庶人。禮書上說：「禮不下庶人，刑不上大夫。」連祭祖宗的廟，也有等級。禮書上又說；天子七，諸侯五，大夫三。士一，庶人無廟，祭於寢。大約古代士以上爲統治者，庶人以下爲被治者。唐代最重進士。當時及第進士，俯視中黃郞。落第進士，仍然可以平揖蒲華長。（對演聞見錄）薜超已做宰相。尚以不是進士出身爲恨事。（見摭言）明朝初年的監生，可以奉皇帝命整理田賦，興修水利。（見南雍志）下及淸代，荒僻州縣裏秀才。便可包攬詞訟，出入公門。故當時有舉人閣老，秀才尚書的俗諺。至於歷代國家以似法令非法令，養成士人一種放僻邪侈習慣，尤爲駭人聽聞。唐代新進士以紅箋名紙游謁長安右平康坊。（此坊爲妓女所居。見開元遺事）宋朝凡官府公筵及三學齋會，……皆官差諸庫角妓祇直。（見夢梁錄）武林舊事叙官酒庫娼妓說：「名娼皆深藏高閣，未易招呼。……往往皆學舍中人所據，他人未易登也。」是國家公然許士人狎妓，並且士人有獨占高貴妓女特權。淸律官吏狎娼有罪，京師禁令尤嚴，如被巡城御史捉拿，例遭刑杖，唯新科翰林爲例外。淸朝末年，京師大學堂學生，晚間在南城外逛男堂子。（即男娼）夜深了可呌開城門回學校。這都是簡單的例證。所以士階級的優越地位，由封建社會初期直至變相封建末期，私毫未曾變動。至於工商賤視政策，我國自古相傳。漢朝即有工商不得乘車，不得服絲帛的制度。晋代市儈以白巾帖額，書所賣及姓名。一足白履，一足黃履。（見廣韻儈字注）你看這樣服色，不是比現在舞臺上挿科打諢的丑脚，還要難看。服飾如此，其他待遇，可以類推。但自鴉片戰爭後（一五四二年）吾國雖仍然爲變相封建社會，然西方帝國主義，滔滔東來。國內受其影響，資產階級，忽焉拾頭。從來賤視他的，現在唯恐依附之不暇。至若七的皆级；在這　　下，已不能應付新環境，　昔威權，行將失墜，如不依附權門，便不能維持生命。這正如社會學家告訴我們：每個時代政權支配者，即每個時代經濟優越階級。中世紀未葉，資本主義完成，政治主權，就婦賽產階級及其所家養的不生產勞動者（即智識階級）所獨占。在某一時期，不生產勞動者，得豐厚收入，在政治上對支配階級，必盡忠誠義務。例如中古時僧侶，爲壓制並調劑農奴社會，以保護封建財產之必要人物。及入資本主義社會。侶僧旣非保護資本財產要具，他的地位，與封建制度同歸消滅。由是資本國家的雇員·官吏·律師·新聞家·醫生。文學家·所組織的團體或政黨即代之而興。</p>
<p>五四中心人物爲大學生，即是智識階級，即是不生產勞動者，亦即吾國相傳所謂士的階級。他們生於資產階級勃興時代，西方文化經濟席捲而來，舊的傳統思想，及舊的社會組織，俱已根本動搖，目覩本階級日暮途窮，不設法改造局面，行將沒落。一二雄傑之士，一方需飽足自己領袖慾望，一方要維持本階級歷來的尊榮，抓住個好題目，做一個破天荒的舉動。於是幾個學生代表，應運而生，出賣風雲電雨，表面上是光明磊落，實際一般官僚政客手腕技術，已『試用得具體而微。「所謂」植黨撓官府之政；，叩閥　黜陟之權，受賂覥詆朝紳；設局騙脅民庶』（曹君引齊東野語）南宋大學生故技，五四時候，大半爲事實的再演。這樣一來，幾位學生代表，個人目的，業已達到，而且博得民衆的歡呼，本階級全體的喝采，於是『時勢所造的英雄』遂以實現。至於坐包車，吃館子，玩美人，是做政治活動賣身投靠過程中必有舉動，且爲歷代養士所　縱出的惡習慣，那更不成問題了。</p>
<p>要之五四運動。是劃時代的，一方結束南宋大學生及過去士階級的舊局，（南宋大學生諸生事，詳周密癸辛雜識及齊東野語，與五四運動，極爲類似，茲不詳述。）二方爲新智識階級剏一新紀元。五四距現在已十六七年，此十六七年中，國內學校內外所發生現象，以及一切光　陸　的活　，是否爲『五四霉菌』所傳播，是大家共見共聞的事實，吾們也不必辨論了。總之「勿蔑視五四遝動時代意義。千萬不要重看那九個時代所造成的英雄』。　君這種　話，是我們所極端贊同的！</p>
<h3>名譽老婆婆（八）</h3>
<p>— 江馬修作任鈞釋</p>
<p>鈴高網得幾乎要號　個　。但是，幾分鐘以後，她幹着活，又變成了陰　，沈　，接着，　念起佛來。她仍然一心一意地糾緾着神佛。</p>
<p>九月的某一天晚上，　飯老婆婆完全把工人寄宿舍打掃乾凈了，就比平日稍爲早些回到自已家裏去。</p>
<p>「哎，現在且讓我回到家裏去給丈夫飯吃，替他揩身體吧。這麽　　的老婆婆，在家裏也還有好人在等待着呀，哈哈。請安息！』</p>
<p>後來，還沒有經過一個鐘頭，在我家的門口忽然發出了出乎人家意料之外的老婆婆的好像發了這般的大笑和呌喊。</p>
<p>『哈哈，名譽，名譽！那裏還有比這更光榮的名譽！萬歲，萬歲！』</p>
<p>這時候，在爐邊跟我們談着話的母親就不知不覺地被着眉頭說：</p>
<p>「唉，那個老婆婆現在是怎麽攪起的？是發了瘋呢，還是喝醉了酒？」</p>
<p>「太太！」老婆婆來勢洶洶地，呌喚着，跑進門來。『請你聽我說吧。我的見子戰死了！名譽的戰死！這不是很了不起嗎？噯？』</p>
<p>她滿臉淚痕，眼睛奇異地閃亮着。并且還張開那沒有牙齒的嘴巴在笑。那神情，實在悽慘得很。</p>
<p>「唉，你的兒子也終於戰死了！」母親的眼淚不知不覺地流下來了。</p>
<p>『太太，你哭什麼？』她坐在門框一笑着說：『沒有什麽値得哭泣的事情。跟大家所說的一般，這是爲着國家，這蹙名譽的戰死。究竟還是我的兒子了不起。我眞高興，高興到了不得。所以我從頭就祇是笑着。哈哈哈……」</p>
<p>她神經質的地更加笑得厲害。</p>
<p>據老婆婆說，當她剛才回到家裏去的時候，附近的人們都集攏在那裏。他們告訴她，在她還沒有回來酌時候，衙門裏已經來了通知，說是勇造戰死了。們們還用各種話語去安慰她。</p>
<h3>星加坡港中（下）</h3>
<p>— 劉明</p>
<p>「幹甚？米……人家紅毛兒在丟銀角子，馬來鬼在搶呀！」</p>
<p>麻面小夥子就打趣道：</p>
<p>「老頭子，怎麽不去搶呀，叫你這兩個小鬼！」</p>
<p>老頭子看見頭二等艙那面一會兒就有好些個銀角子丟下海去，便也向麻面小夥子椰揄道：</p>
<p>「吝色鬼，像你麽？……你看人家多大方哪！」</p>
<p>「呸，那是大方麽？……那是有幾個造孽錢，在尋開心呀！」</p>
<p>麻面小夥子把措一下臉的汗手，重重地拍着船欄杆，帶着生氣的認眞的樣子。</p>
<p>「呵，丢下一塊大洋哪！」</p>
<p>旁邊還有幾個人像在吃驚，又像在羨慕似的，一齊呌了起來。</p>
<p>老頭子，也彷彿立刻失去了詼諧的心情，突出莊嚴的面孔，咬着牙齒低聲獨自說道：</p>
<p>「哼，這些東西呵！……」</p>
<p>但從頭二等艙那面透過來的聲音，却是，</p>
<p>“Verygood！”</p>
<p>看海面上，正是一個水淋淋的頭，和一隻擎着大洋的膀子，現了出來。</p>
<p>同時，甲板這面上，也在人叢中暴吼出一個混着痰的聲音。</p>
<p>「好！」</p>
<p>麻面小夥子回過頭來一看，原來這聲音的主人翁，就正是剛從碼頭回來的中年胖商人。側邊立着那位常常拋文的靑年，在現出羨慕馬來人的神情，搖頭擺腦像咏嘆似的說道：</p>
<p>「咳，誰說」勤有功，戲無益』呢？」</p>
<p>中年胖商人大約給這遊戲深深感動了，連忙用帕子擦一擦臉，就伸手朝衣袋裏摸出一個銅板，向附近這邊一個划艇的馬來人那裏丟去。那位馬來人立刻對丟去的東西，很迅速地瞥了一下，像馬上就明白那是銅元似的，便翻過臉來，輕蔑地搖一搖手，就劃起走了。</p>
<p>「媽的！那不是錢？」</p>
<p>中年胖商人紅了臉，不滿意地說。</p>
<p>「人家，那要你銅的，白亮亮的才看得起哪！」</p>
<p>人叢中有誰在謏諷他說着。</p>
<p>麻面小夥子滿心稱意地大笑起來。</p>
<p>中年胖商人不服氣似的，低着滿是汗珠的額頭，竭力搜尋他的衣袋子。</p>
<p>麻面小夥子故意向海面上的馬來人高聲喊道：</p>
<p>「黑鬼，不要看不起人，咱們銀的就　　　　。」</p>
<p>中年胖商人解開他的衣衫，拉着袋子邊看邊找又氣又急地說道：</p>
<p>「媽！哪裏去　，剛才還……」</p>
<p>愛拋文的靑年站在旁邊，做出帮他尋覓的樣子，問是：</p>
<p>「你到底找什麽？」</p>
<p>「那個……那個……假角子！」</p>
<p>「嗨，你剛才不是買香烟混去用了麽？」　忽然那面起着喝采的聲音，大家立刻偏着頭望去，中年胖商人就乘機躲進艙下去了。</p>

<h3>全國運動大會第六日　上海榮獲男女田徑三錦標　六日來共造全國新紀錄十一項　全能運動男女游泳俱今日開始　男子網球籃球今日秩序最吃緊</h3>
<p>全國運動大會昨爲第六日、男女田徑全告結束、上海隊以極大之勝利、榮獲男子田賽男子徑賽女子田徑三錦標、昨日又創男子四百公尺及女子二百公尺壘球擲遠等三項全國新紀錄、六日來共造十一項新紀錄之多、女子四百公尺接力、上海隊因犯規、取消冠軍、可惜、男子全能運動及男女游泳、俱將於今日開始、游泳因楊秀瓊之登塲、定必轟動一時、球類之中、男子籃球、及男子網球、今日最爲吃緊、男子雙打舉行複賽、男子單打則舉行半複賽、好手全部出動、得失異常重要、球塲客滿、意中之事、</p>
<h3>女子四百公尺接力決賽上海隊取銷資格　王開照相證明錯跑線道　張伯苓審查認證據確實　所造全國紀錄取銷可惜　廣東隊遞補冠軍</h3>
<p>女子四百公尺接力决賽、參加者共計六隊、上海隊雖以五十四秒五之成績、得第一名、但惜第四棒李森之跑錯跑道、經第二名置東隊之口頭抗議、經審判委員會主席張伯苓之調査、證據確實、有王開之淸晰照相爲證、故張已决定將上海隊之第一名資格取銷、以第二名廣東隊升補、其下依次遞升、因共祇六隊、故第六名缺、經判定之名次如下、</p>
<h3>總錦標得分</h3>
<p>男子</p>
<p>上海　八分　遼寗　四分</p>
<p>馬華　三分　北平　二分</p>
<p>山西　二分　南京　一分</p>
<p>女子</p>
<p>上海　四分　馬華　三分</p>
<p>廣東　二分　福建　一分</p>
<p>決賽時情形</p>
<p>决賽二時舉行、上海錢行素跑第一棒、焦玉蓮第二、彭愛浦第三、李森第四棒、上海隊一路佔先、拋落廣東約五六公尺、但至第三第四兩棒接棒時、因彭李兩人接棒之不得法、廣東末棒趙云珊脫穎而出、李森追趕、勝廣東隊一肩而巳、成績五十四秒五、破全國紀錄、廣東第一、馬來第三、靑閩平次之、</p>
<p>廣東隊抗議</p>
<p>决賽剛畢、廣凍隊忽發現上海隊最後一棒、跑錯跑道、急口頭向審判委員會主席張伯苓抗議、謂有某人等俱見、但只有人證、並無物證、不能信口憑言、乃提議將王開所攝照片査察、</p>
<p>有照相為證</p>
<p>適王開起點及終點俱攝有照片、異常淸晰、發見王開所攝之照片、上海第一棒錢行素在第五跑道、而終點李森則在第六跑道、故上海隊之犯規、巳極爲明顯、證據確實、照片在比賽成績上、足供參考、於此可見、</p>
<p>決取銷資格</p>
<p>故該二　片經張伯苓審查一後、認爲上海確實犯規、廣東隊之抗議、不必再行召集會議、决定逕請上海隊之資格取消、芷式通告、將於今日發表、據一般猜測、上海隊三四兩棒、接棒不佳、故即在此時期、李森錯走跑道、事前檢察之報告、謂各人站立之綫線、並無錯誤、北平末棒亦發現李森在其前面、阻礙去路、故上海隊之犯規、事實顯明、成績尚佳、取銷不無可惜也、</p>

<h3>萬米決賽盛況　谷得勝以恒力取勝</h3>
<p>三四分十一秒六創大會新錄</p>
<p>每圈時問支配極佳大可取法</p>
<p>萬米爲大會田徑賽最末之一項，參加者有山西之谷得勝、李登桂、王會斌、陳樹森、及上海之王正林、江蘇之金仲康等健將、參加比賽者、多震山西之威名、不敢下塲、故臨時棄者甚多、實際參加比賽者、只三十餘人、就中山西之四光頭、最爲觀衆所注意、加之播音台上報告「二〇五號谷得勝、有獲勝希望、</p>
<p>張良獻策　滬王導先</p>
<p>賽前、上海王正林、張良、密議挑虎雖山之計、上塲時由張良快跑、引山西諸將隨之、如斯可先使山西諸將疲於奔命、然後張良棄權、王正林乘機戰勝山西健兒、開塲後、張良即用力奔跑、但山西諸將、經騐頗足、不爲所動、張跑至二千三百米處、黑然棄權不跑、第一圈時、谷得勝居第六位、第二圈時、張良居第一、金仲康居弟二、谷得勝居第四、千五百米時、張良首先跑完、成績四分四十八秒正、</p>
<p>三千公尺　創新紀錄</p>
<p>至三千公尺處、谷王競爭頗烈、王正林成績九分五十五秒正、谷得勝成績九分五十五秒四、均打破全國紀錄（全國三千米紀錄為十分五秒）第八圈時李登桂居第一位、王會斌第二、谷得勝第三、廣西之黃瑞文第四、至第九圈時、谷得勝一躍而領導羣雄、王正林亦奮勇超過李登桂、此時金仲康居第六位、山東鈕鴻鈴居第七位、山西陳樹森居第九位、江蘇何寶山居第七位、</p>
<p>五千公尺　成績驚人</p>
<p>至五千公尺處時、谷得勝以十六分五十三秒、打破五千公尺全國紀錄、王正林繼以十六分五十六秒、亦破全國紀錄、自第九圈起、至第二十圈止、谷得勝一路佔先、如入無人之境、而王正林與李登桂在後競爭頗烈、於第十六圈時、王勝李約四公尺</p>
<p>健步如飛　直撲終點</p>
<p>至九千公尺入、谷得勝之步代突然變大、健步如飛、其餘諸子均望歷莫及、此時谷距策二名達八十公尺而超過最末一人逹三圈半、谷以三十二分四十秒跑畢九千五百米、最後一圈、谷之步伐尤健、一路直衝終點、成績三十四分十一秒六、打破大會紀錄、但以未能打破全國紀錄爲憾、第二王芷林與第三王會斌競爭頗烈、王正林僅佔先一步獲第二、而李登桂則退居第四、廣西之黃瑞文、名將也、在桂曾破全國紀錄、此次亦得第五、老當益壯之　仲康、取得第六、尤堪嘉獎、何寶山以第上落選、</p>
<p>全部成績頗足參考</p>
<p>冠軍谷得勝成績爲三十四分十一秒六、大會正式公佈之紀錄）、據記者昨爲二三名計時、王正林之成績爲四十四分三十二秒四、王會斌之成績爲三十四分三十二秒六名次如下、</p>

<h3>港粵馬鼎足之勢　游泳今日開始逐鹿</h3>
<p>廣西選手異軍突起亦不可忽視</p>
<p>楊安妮未來美人魚得脾睨一切</p>
<p>男女游泳錦標、今日下午在游泳池開始、參加者男子計魯·菲·青·贛·冀·浙·威·京·桂·閩，蘇·平·皖·新·海·港·粵·馬·滬等十九單位、女子僅京·桂·閩·港·粵·馬·滬等七單位、首日秩序、計有預賽五、複賽三、項目則爲男女五十公尺自由預複賽、男子一百公尺自由式預賽、女子一百公尺仰泳預賽、男子二百公尺俯泳預複賽、本屆各單位實力、異常雄厚、其中尤以港粵馬滬爲最、而異軍突起之廣西省、實力雖未悉其詳、但於連日在市池練習時觀察、錦標固難染指、而各項目中或有一二冷門出現亦未可知、至於錦標問題、本屆男女均成港粵馬鼎足紛爭之勢、上海雖擁有不少名將、决無問鼎之望、女子則上海尤爲悽慘、何文錦爲京市拉去、此外陳寶璇周秀珍等、不過得有位置希望、巳爲滿足、上屆男泳錦標爲粵、女泳爲港、本屆且看結果如何、馬華楊安妮不來、美人魚又將睥睨一切男女個人錦標除接力外共十項、其九巳爲港隊襲中物、惟港隊本屆有不少猛將如郭振恒輩、均改隸粵省旗幟之下、實行倒戈、而豪柱劉寶希、又迄今未至、未知能否趕到、實成問題、</p>

<h3>單打今日半複賽　許承基對王文正　林寶華遇林望蘇　雙打複賽亦於今日接連舉行</h3>
<p>男子綱球、今日爲緊要關頭、勝負有關錦標、下午一時起、單打半複賽四塲，三時起、雙打複賽兩塲、均五盤三勝、內以許承基對王文正、林寳華對林望蘇之單打、及林邱對馬華林望蘇阮國英之雙打、尤爲精彩，蓋俱屬全國第一流名將、每組實力平均競爭定益劇烈、龍爭虎鬥、不可多得、誠空前之盛舉、今日綱球塲上、定有人滿之患、</p>
<h3>北閏選手後生可畏　馬華幾遭不測　望蘇其安均從死裏逃生　爪哇二將勝來全不費力</h3>
<p>男子網球昨賽四塲、均爲三賽、得複賽權者、計爪哇許承基、曾端才、馬華林望蘇、陳其安、將於今日分別與上海四川爭奪複賽資格、昨日許承基曾端才之獲得勝利、毫無疑問、林望蘇對解華、及陳其安對溫亞文兩組、幾出冷們、各於極艱苦困難之局面中、博得最後勝利、亦云險矣、茲將戰况分誌於次、</p>
<p>許承基客客氣氣</p>
<p>未展所長</p>
<p>國手許承基之球藝、巳登峯造極、無庸多言、此次單打冠軍、極有把握、昨遇河北張鑫華、遠非其敵、許君牛刀小試、未展所長、隨便打來、巳使張招架爲難、開賽後、許一鼓而下、速取五局、但亦不事苛求、客客氣氣、奉途一局、以六比一結束第一盤、第二盤起、許仍先得四局、總因存心客氣、不願使對方難堪、特再大贈品、最後仍以六比一終塲、</p>
<p>曾端才穩健可風</p>
<p>連勝兩盤</p>
<p>爪哇曾端才之球藝、不過爾爾、惟穩健可風、江蘇徐次達、無名之輩、才識兩缺、昨雖一度掙扎、卒歸敗北、戰爭開始、徐即取攻勢、奪得一局、曾連勝兩局、以二此一領前、徐造成各以六十手、曾冉加四局、遂以六比二先勝一盤、再戰聲中、徐小心應戰、盡力反抗、取得兩局、不料從此一蹶不振、被曾一再獲點、反以五比二遙遙領前、入後雖扳回一局、但巳無補大局、以六比三結束是</p>
<p>林望蘇死裏逃生</p>
<p>一嗚驚人</p>
<p>左臂將軍林望蘇、於二年前威名顯赫、不可一世、日來球藝未見進步、北平解華、無藉藉名、惟技甚可取、正手抽球、重而有力、惜反手毫無把握、而經騐亦嫌欠缺耳、否則昨日極可擊敗望蘇、一步上青雲、但昨戰結果、巳使觀衆愕然、而望蘇亦巳飽受虛驚矣、鐘鳴一下、戰事爆發、解固非林對手、但大敵當前、不甘屈服、故拚命抵抗、不憚奔跑、終因實力稍差、以二比六負首盤、第二盤、解格外小心、左右掃射、剛柔並施連、連得三局、望蘇亦不得不望球興嘆、繼林得發球局、旋解以穩健柔糯之抽球、左右前後、源源輸途、林則疲於奔命、甘拜下風、解以六比一奪回一盤、造成各一平手、</p>
<p>雖敗猶榮</p>
<p>下盤爲生死關頭、解於初賽時、固自認不敵、但至此時、大有開天見日、壓倒强敵之希望、一嗚驚人、固所願也、是以野心勃勃、力圖宏展、林知對方亦非弱者、上盤顏色、巳領受無遣、故特小心翼翼、不敢慌亂、否則不幸失敗、非特錦標前途、大受影響、即個人名譽、亦將掃地矣、雙方心理如此、競爭自更劇烈、林先發球、得勝還朝、解照樣奉敬、並且格外叨好、加倍奉還、林亦連取兩局、以三比二佔先、下局解發球以一比二記落後、繼有一出界球、裁判誤爲解勝、得是局、旋又得兩局、五比三解頜前、林竭力追上一局、以四比五落後下局解發球、是爲勝負關鍵、不料解求勝心切、反不能操縱自如、野球迭見、乃成各五和局、林發球勝先局、以六比五雙居上風、解悉心應戰、打成各六平手、是時解焦灼萬分、反不若第二盤之鎭靜、因之時有錯誤、予對方進攻之機會、雖又打成各七和局、但大勢巳去、無能爲力、終被望蘇、以九比七獲得最後勝利、</p>
<p>陳其安幾遭不測</p>
<p>苦盡甘來陳其安爲馬來亞名將、昨戰北平溫亞文、幾乎失敗、上塲之初溫以美妙之抽擊、橫截兩邊、時遠時近、忽左忽右、大擺瘟瘟陣、小陳走頭無路、連失五營、繼雖扳回一局、終以一比六敗下陣來、第二盤開始、其安探得門徑、連勝二局、風頭一轉、溫元帥成竹在胸、不以爲意、三比二、四比三、屢次佔先、陳則緊隨於後、寸步不離、一時空氣頗爲緊張、繼陳拚命反攻、反以五比四、六比五後來居上、下局經極長久之作戰、始成各六平手、是時溫元帥又大發雷霆、亂洒瘟　沙、果然效騐立見、又以七比六、八比七反敗爲勝、而小陳雖小受挫折、不甘目棄、振臂一呼、連拔三城、逐以十比八造成各一盤局面、第三盤雙方均感力乏、但勝負得失、在此一關、故均拚死作戰、小陳尤爲奮勇、四比二、五比三、一路居先、一不經心、溫將軍又施故技、長抽短截、左右夾攻、三元連中、六比五又佔上風、小陳背城借一、破釜沉舟、用足勁道、加上三局、八比六勉强得勝、</p>

<h3>今日雙打複賽　滬晉兩對姊妹有劇戰</h3>
<p>今日女子網球祇雙打複賽兩塲、甚爲重要、山西王春菁王春葳、對上海魏祖同魏麥谷之比賽、預料必有精彩表演、誰勝誰負、有關錦標得失、是賽勝者、即可獲得冠軍、藍另一組複賽、馬來陸素立謝妮莉對四川黎玉萍趙蘊華、實力平均、俱非滬晋之敵、</p>
<h3>單打半複賽　魏麥谷苦戰挫王春葳</h3>
<p>第三盤共賽二十局始分勝負　王春菁黃山農陳淸得陳淸得複賽權</p>
<p>女子網球單打昨舉行半複賽、第二單打上海魏麥谷以刁滑之軟球、制伏山西王春葳剛銳之抽打、以二比一獲勝、奪得複賽權、誠可喜之事也、首盤魏即以七比五勝、次盤春葳大發雌威、敬一光盤、第三盤打得難解難分、高下難判、但魏始終佔優、卒以十一比九苦盡甘來、另一組南京陳淸對北平唐明珍之比賽、依樣葫蘆、如出一轍、亦打得精疲力極、陳淸以二比一得複賽樣、其餘兩組山西王春菁、與南京黃山農、均勝來全不費力、</p>
<p>黃山農</p>
<p>南京黃山農與四川葉玉如之比賽、結束最早、黃山農截髮短褲、宛如男子、故矯捷善戰、葉玉如身體矮胖、不善奔跑、兩人實力懸殊、開首一盤、山農六比一勝來極易、下盤略有競爭、三三、四四、玉如緊隨不放、卒以四比六再敗、</p>
<p>王春菁</p>
<p>穩得女子單打錦標之王春菁、昨戰廣東楊渭濱、王亦以六比一、六比四勝、但頗有競爭、表演甚佳、楊渭濱先曾擊敗上海第一單打茅於文、球藝自屬不凡、穩健耐戰、火氣全無、抽打還救、淸脫自然、故能於第二盤中予王春葳極大威脅、先以三比一佔優、使覜家大爲興奮、但結果仍不免於淘汰、</p>
<p>女子二百公尺起步（國際及王開攝）</p>
<p>魏一個人谷</p>
<p>魏與王春葳二人、一軟一硬、各有所長、初魏小姐厘次佔先、形勢極好、但四比二後、被王追成四四、再成五五、魏以高球窘敵、使王自投羅網、果然連得二局、先聲奪人、次盤王表記純熟、鮮有自殺、銳急之抽球、使魏招架爲難、竟勝光盤、第三盤你一局、我一局、堅持到底、各以發球局勝、魏始終領前、王則追隨平手、各不鬆懈、最後俱巳精疲力盡、魏專以軟球還敬、王則用力抽打、魏曾有祇差一分之勝盤機會五次、均交臂失之、殊爲可惜、王因自殺迭見、終以九比十一慘遭淘汰、</p>
<p>陳淸</p>
<p>陳與北平唐明珍之戰、與魏王之役、如出一轍、目爲最後一組結束、其牽絲爲如此者、一人均矯捷善跑、球藝平均、各得一盤後、第三盤自三比三、騐至六比六、互前互後、各不相讓、打得汗如雨下、舉步爲難、唐再勝發球局、以七比五佔先、下局陳發球、唐連勝三記、是盤之勝、祇差一記、以爲垂手可得、不意往後竟不能攫得此最實貴之一記、於是先自氣餒、反以七比九受落選、惜哉階哉、</p>

<h3>女籃球次賽　江蘇力挫北平　滬粵閩三軍均入複賽週　　優勝劣敗冀浙豫遭淘汰</h3>
<p>昨日體育館中之籃球戰完全為女子次賽、先後共計四塲、叱咤風雲之地、一談鶯聲燕語之塲、首戰爲上海對河北、上海隊挾其堅强之雄師、一戰而克、次塲廣東對浙江，廣東亦爲列强之一、勝西子姑娘、毫不費力、閩豫之戰、變方實力懸殊、閩軍對錦標有問鼎之心、實力平凡之河南隊、何堪抵抗、最後一塲、江蘇對北平、故都女子籃球、向享盛名、惜舊將黃淑愼孫桂雲等、均風流雲散、新軍雖銳、經騐究覺稍差、竟以二分之美、被江蘇吃　、江蘇隊昨日表演特佳、前鋒徐碧雲、尤爲出色、此滬閩粵蘇四隊、遂均獲得複賽權、江蘇對上海、廣東對福建、定明日下午二三兩時複賽、鹿死誰手、尚未敢必、據一般觀測、當以上海福建希望較大也、昨日戰情如後、</p>
<p>上海勝河北　六十三對二十二</p>

<p>江蘇勝北平　二十六對二十四</p>
<p>滬上陳家將克河北</p>
<p>上海對河北之於昨晨十時舉行、上海隊之球藝巳爲觀衆所公認、陳家將本領高超、大阿姐榮明、巳脫離女兒國、觀其搶刦投擲、與毛頭小夥子何異、陳白雪矮子肚內疙瘩多、等間人眞勿擺浪心上、河北隊在初戰時、滿擬極力抗拒、予滬隊以一下馬威、但力不從心、徒喚奈何、喪師失地、敗走麥城、</p>
<p>鳴金開戰後、冀隊一度以四對二佔先、此後遂一蹶不振、首節中尚可免力應付、二節中陳榮明左右逢源、有投必中、遂以二十七對八獲勝上半時、陳主將見大下大事巳定、功成身退、下半時袖手旁觀、陳聚才接任王位、競賽又轉劇烈、最後榮明又複出山、分數頻巳增加、結果以六十三對二十二大勝、</p>

<p>江蘇小姐力克故都</p>
<p>壓軸戲江蘚對北平、兩軍實力均在伯仲之間、故戰情極爲緊張、以過去之成績觀之、江蘇似較北平稍遜一籌、詎昨日北平隊形勢頗現慌張、投籃欠準、後衛尤爲疏忽、以蘇隊表演特佳、隊長徐碧雲、尤爲出色、遠射近投、如有神助、功勞簿上、應列第一、後衛陳兆珍、膽大心細、邵維榮力大如牛、後防治安、賴以維持、</p>
<p>平隊了琤琤、本極活潑、昨受嚴密監視、無法活動、沈崇寄的是將材、競賽正烈時、忽被召返、實係該隊失策處、最後一分鐘、北平倘能造成平等局面、則勝當屬之該隊也、戰幕揭開、平沈崇寄　開紀錄、丁琤琤繼之罰中、蘇隊徐碧雲原璧歸趙、趙慧貞興師勤王、六對四獲勝首節、哈慶慈易王燄登塲、開張大吉、沈前鋒忽被召回、徐中鋒半塲試擲、居然命中、北平隊緊巳相隨、上半時終了、僅以四分落後、</p>
<p>再戰聲中、沈崇寄復登塲、即命中一球、相差僅二分、此後各不相讓、你一隻我一隻、距離總四分之間、至最後三分鐘時、蘇軍以二十四對十八領前、北平沈丁二鋒、速進兩球、情勢緊張、幸由黃連珍加上二分、但不旋踵間、平隊哈中將翻身一擲、又趨接近、江蘇此時己力尺精疲、失去把持能力、危險萬分、急懸免戰牌、稍事休息、再戰後、又一分鐘、銀笛長鳴、二四比二一一、勝利卒歸江蘇、裁判舒鴻、檢察宋君復、陣綫如下、</p>

<h3>河北倖勝上海　八對六勝得決賽權</h3>
<p>十七日與山東奪標</p>
<p>女子壘球、河北隊一帆風順、初勝江蘇、昨克上海、將於明日下午二時、與山東爭雄奪霸、上屆錦標廣東、巳失落其權、乃成爲華北區內河北山東之逐鹿、昨日冷落巳久之看台上、乃有上海吳市長蒞臨觀光、士氣爲之一振、開賽之初、斜雨撲面、幸天公作美、不久雨收晴放、比賽按常進行、興越倍增、司球裁判員侯洛洵、司壘裁判員高梓、紀錄員夏開明、</p>
<p>陸家軍振威河北隊</p>
<p>河北投手陸韻嫣、接手陸慶嫣、得心應手、成績佳好、內壘監視嚴密、外翼防衛周到、上海入攻不易、其七局中、上海能獲分而歸者、占四局之多、賴其擊法之神妙也、惟是河北全隊、投接之老練、策略之豐富、確有過於上海、其得勝利、雖不無僥倖、亦屬實至名歸、選手九人、陸氏一門竟據其四、成績均超人一等、說者謂河北隊、亦可稱爲陸家姊妹軍、是亦女子壘球賽中之佳話矣、</p>
<p>杜素貞領導上海隊</p>
<p>上海隊抱有熱烈希望、奪標決心、第一次出塲、即遭毒手殊非意料所及、按彼時作戰形勢、上海未始不可與河北對抗、觀其第二局至第五局之經過、且有超越之趨、何奈第一局損失太大、最後第六局中、又受意外打擊、一腔熱血、從此消去、其投手杜素貞頗具功夫、長身玉立、大有全隊領導之姿態、接手錢坤格、力盡天職、始終不懈、內壘外翼、高接底欄、得手應心、極見合作、雖敗猶榮、</p>
<p>大喜之後竟失六分</p>
<p>上海先取攻勢、楊依仁沖頭陳、一棒在手、靜觀來球、福至心靈棒不虛發、球沿左邊綫滾出、峻急難擋、楊依仁乃單騎冲關、一壘二壘二壘而至本壘、一舉而出本壘打、全隊大喜若狂、不料河北反攻時、上海稍一不愼竟鑄大錯、致河北得四記安打、獲分者有黃蓮蓬、崔慧嫻陸惠瑾陸韻嫣李文秀陸慧嫣六人、可謂禍福無常焉、</p>
<p>奮鬥五局方成平數</p>
<p>上海突受重大打擊、意興闌珊、敎練申國權立授機略、精神又振、第二局胡佐瓊連跑帶偷、亦歸本壘、獲得一分、第三局互在相持局面之下、平安過去、第四局苓智生球越右翼之後、得本疊打、又獲一分、河北依然故我、毫無發展、第五局乃上海全盤時代、先後發現四記安打、而獲分歸壘者楊依仁錢坤裕陳再春三人、至時上海隊奮鬥五局、造成六六平數、非易事也、</p>
<p>兩記安打立分高下</p>
<p>五局勝負相等、高下之分、乃在第六第七兩局之成績若何、上海三人、均遭閉門羹、輪及河北、陸慧嫣荷榨先登、球如矢出、陸飛奔而歸、乃因半途忘觸二壘、罰駐二壘、再待後命、幸而陳蘭湘助以安打、陸遂如願以償、獲中一分、陳亦乘上海投手野球之暇、獲分而返、河北兩記安打、得中二分、遂以八對六勝上海、而獲得次賽權、進與山東爭奪錦標矣、</p>

<p>休息後、戰幕冉開、粵軍五虎左有衝突、如入無人之境、小黑炭馳騁全塲、威風不减當年、京方束手無策、抵抗乏術、又先後失陷四城、至是京左翼楊人偉、抱背域借一之計、單人匹馬、闖進敵營、迅電不及掩耳脚法、攻打球門、幸運高照、竟然中的、勸呼聲中、免吃鴨蛋、最後港左鋒李鴻淸在暮色蒼瞑中、凑成一打之數、以十二戰一、鳴金收兵、</p>

<h3>叱咤風雲廣東力克香港</h3>
<p>二比三　雌威張皇各顯神通　鏖戰掙扎難解難分</p>
<p>女排球次賽、昨有兩塲、（一）上海對河南、河南已事先聲明放棄、上海遂獲得複賽權、（二）廣東對香港、兄弟鬩墻緊凑非凡、結果廣東勝、戰績如下、</p>
<p>兄弟　墻　球塲熱開</p>
<p>論排球人才、以比賽練習之便利、共造就輙屬於南國兒女、此原屬於天才及環境之支配、初未可强與人同者也、香港廣東、同屬此中能手、　雄相遇、各關前程、其拚殺自必高人一等、名利所關、其手足之情雖重、亦祇可擯棄不顧、基於此種立塲、女排球場之觀衆、遂加倍擁擠、男男女女、混成一堆、側座看臺、人頭湧塞、童子軍忙於維持秩序、兩隊號召力之强盛、於此可見、而排球場之熱閙、亦確爲本屆大會之第一遭、</p>
<p>健美女性　各顯通神</p>
<p>二時許、粵隊由楊杏芬率鎖出塲、港隊由朱穎芬率領出塲、巾幗鬚眉、於　艷如花之中、含剛毅堅强之氣、儀態雄壯、不愧為健美女性、三時開賽、香港先發制人、迭創紀錄、朱敎新咬牙切齒、不甘以昔日威風、輕易讓度、乃急起直追、以進退磨當、各有建設、惟後排壁壘鬆懈、故球入底淺、即難救藥、前易遂以二十一比十七受挫、</p>
<p>振臂長嘯　奪回一局</p>
<p>香港旣勝一局、全塲人員、乃更見活　、居然一帆風順、氣呑全牛、於五比五時、粵隊顏秀容楊玉瓊、大動殺心、乃偷閒耳語、同下毒手、居然一球入境、振臂長嘯、但見身材雖小、而脅力過人、躍蹤遠殺、即入敵區底綫、時港隊正忙於防網、不圖奇兵突出、球入後方、無以補救、從此勢力反盛、以十一比七換塲、粵隊林德貞發球自殺、港隊亦略有得分、結果二十一比十七、廣東勝、</p>
<p>鏖戰掙扎　老將殺手</p>
<p>雙方得失相並、在棋逢敵手之下、爭執異常猛烈、側座　衆、更呐喊助威、而一部分女選手「妙妙妙妙」之尖長聲浪、更形成嗷嘈之天下、第三局上半塲平淡過去、下半塲分數以接近而各自火冒、雙方短兵相接、無瑕可摘、於是自各二而進至各二十二、最後顏秀容利用高球機會、趕到網前、一殺定局、顏秀容雖不老、而有老將風範、不慌不忙、的是可人、比數爲二十四對二十二</p>
<p>目迷五色　粵軍又挫</p>
<p>第四局在雌威張皇之下、又見登塲、密雲驟雨、難解難分、香港能攻而殺劈欠硬、後排葉惠文湯美玉亦比較軟弱、在此種大局面下、應付已感疲乏、在觀衆固屬目迷五色、而當即深感疲於奔命、第四局前塲、廣東以十一對七得換塲、但下半局大意失荊州、又見中原陣地、胡兒充斥、而結果反爲港球造成廿一比十八之差、</p>
<p>拚酒熱血　操奇制勝</p>
<p>第五局爲複賽權之無上關口、粵隊乃各以全付精神、拚灑熱血、果然　騐異常、以十一比九小勝、掉轉區域、港隊不知如何反抱禮　謙抑態度、於是請客分數、不一而足、粵隊諸將、乃得橫行排求塲中、急攻不已、港隊以大勢已去、亦寫寫意意、彈起琵琶、廣東遂以廿一對十二操奇制勝、而致勝之由、半固屬於港隊之放鬆、而半亦屬於經騐之豐富也、總比數爲之對二、</p>
<p>陰陽怪氣　浙江敗北</p>
<p>香港隊於昨日日下午十二時半、即到塲練習、英雄氣概、於　十女選手擁護捧塲之下蒞塲、老將風範、畢　威靈顯　、一時、浙江隊出塲、拈　開球、何述聚一發不中、香港李沃林得救傳托、較送左角、盧百寗見機可　、揚臂疾擊、　開紀錄、浙江隊長陸錫帖、素有骨氣、未甘屈居人後、遂於香港發球時、獨當一面、水來土淹、兵來將當、着　有些花樣、比教自六六。七七、而八八，九九、始終緊緊迫趕、香港雖老於行伍，亦覺一籌莫展、下半塲掉過戰區、港軍盧百寗發球、以球出平硬、而浙江後路無人、以致連珠砲聲，皆中要害、接續六分、使浙江生路毫無、於是陰陽怪氣中、浙江十七比廿一先負一局、</p>
<p>送舊迎新　再失重寨</p>
<p>第二局浙江本望收復失地、但流年不利、先失四分、及稍稍趕到接近、又為香港送到半天裏、直至張錫祜發球、為香港擊還、張長子再趕網前、攔阻出路、自拉自唱、大有送舊迎新局面、浙江辦理、角色欠缺、於此可知、於十一比七香港先着勢下換塲、浙江反攻至烈不料好事多磨、於倖勝心理之下、反造縣殊比數、終局為廿一比十三、西子健兒、依然同居籬下、</p>
<p>過關斬將　居然扳轉</p>
<p>第三局上塲、浙江略有進展、香港不能虛懷各谷、少存驕氣、於是爲浙江　崇活何述聖等配搭成功、霎時大刀闊斧、過關斬將、居然死裏逃生、扳轉一局、但比數始終未見野氣、僅十九對廿一兩分而已、</p>
<p>堅壁淸野　最後獲勝</p>
<p>第四局在休息之下、浙江本圖急攻、但以全隊無聯絡、少防禦工作之中、獨木撑船、張錫祜自難以一敵十、故分數重見大創、上半局草草終塲、香港以十一比五佔先、勝利之算、已定大數、改變區域、比浙江冉來攻成、香港全隊前排三將、已堅璧淸野、勿使禁宮秩序、受萬一之影饗、於是在觀衆拉拉聲聲裏、香港又以廿一比九大勝浙江、總比數爲二對一、</p>
<p>（二）上海勝河北</p>
<p>偷營刦寨　巧度陰平</p>
<p>第二塲於下竿三時舉行、由錢　鳴金召集上海河北兩隊作戰、上海隊裏推有歷屆國手曹廷贊丘廣燮等、戰跡之標炳千秋、固已非今日而始、河北張亦誠先發制人、獲得二分、滬隊陳楝才反抗有效、打成平手、從此在混戰局中、滬隊中路殺敵、頗欠功夫、蓋明知河北係南開名宿、於其關網切殺、爲對方高躍閂住、則無寗乘虛襲擊、好得偷營刦賽、兵法上原有成例、技巧小試、頓使戇直之河北陣地、打得落花流水、是局上海遂以二十一比十七、偷度陰平、</p>
<p>丘曹逞威　再下二局</p>
<p>第二局、上海乘勢壓迫、適逢丘廣燮發球、百步穿楊、建樹頗多、曹廷贊居中策應、工架自有獨到、河北以時勢變化、全在機會、故於高球來時、輙輸遞前方、中排高高舉起、前排輕輕段下、前後呼應、巧妙非常、故一度以七比六、佔據上風、但自丘廣燮再起發球一面倒之格局、又重見於生死關頭、而風順水瀉、上海遂再下一局、比數爲二十一對七、</p>
<p>排砲轟炸　直下三局</p>
<p>第三局河北於掙扎之下、稍見進展、但反攻之力量極薄、招架已忙於奔波、怎奈上海陣裏、壓迫重重、故緊張狀態、未見　長、於雙方各十二時、即為　隊　砲　炸、致全部防　工程、　燬無遺、是局上海　　最後之成功、以直落三急進複賽階段、比數為二十一對十四、</p>

<p>女跑王李森、於午在二百公尺决賽時　倒小錢、並創造全國新紀錄、觀衆均呼「小姑娘利害」、一時攝影者十餘人、包圍李森、要求拍照、來一個、再一個、足足有三分鐘之久、李森因香喘未停、大說「請快一點、還要嗎」、</p>
<p>昨日看客們呌上當</p>
<p>大前兩天、天氣苦然、為秋末之怪現象、前夜老天不作美、忽降大雨、昨日陰霧四合、少數觀衆莫不帶傘穿雨衣、惜老天真為作弄、倒不下雨、未帶傘者、均慶慰不堪、但帶備者、皆呌「倒霉上當」不止、</p>
<p>高聲唱名大受窘迫</p>
<p>昨日壘球比賽時有某女運動員、在裁判員點看他們的號數時、牠僅輕輕答應了一聲、但唱名者在四週找尋未見、故提高嗓于再次呌她、她忽面向裁判員含羞而笑、裁判員因之大窘、</p>
<p>大會音樂十分悅耳</p>
<p>此次大會最引人注意的、是西司令豪兩旁公安保安兩音樂隊在每開始完塲、破紀錄、給獎、决賽等時、即奏一曲、聲音悅耳、全塲觀衆精神爲之一振、就是運動員亦覺得興奮得多呢、</p>
<p>土正林是預知先覺</p>
<p>昨日正午萬公尺未賽前、往訪上海宿舍長跑聖手王正林、詢問對於此次萬公尺有何感想、起初王君不肯直說、僅得苦笑、後經記者冉三探問繼說、「那麼我的千五百　幾」賽後果得亞軍、這好像王君早巳在意料中、到有預知先覺之風、</p>
<p>女選手錯認林寳華昨水怪陳振興、揩其「心上人」游於迴廊下、有河南女選手數人、竟誤認為林寶華、其中一人以手指示其同伴曰、「這不是林寳華麽」、水怪聞言操廣東官語曰、我不是林寳華、你不要錯認了、各人見錯認了人、靦覜疾行而去、</p>
<p>浙女選手大敲竹槓</p>
<p>浙江女籃球隊、自勝了山東之後、選手們得意非常、纏住了總領隊、非要設一席慶功宴不可、結果乃在國光路新亞酒樓設宴請全隊選手大吃一頓、</p>
<p>田徑給獎臨時拉夫</p>
<p>田徑賽得分選手給獎、係於每一項目完畢時即舉行之給獎者、乃臨時在司令台要人中拉夫而得者、昨日到塲要人極力拉夫乃絕、感困難結果、見吳醒亞高居看台、乃臨時拉攏、出塲給獎、</p>
<h3>會塲花絮</h3>
<p>李森愛吃全運飯</p>
<p>據說本屆全運會是李森的世界、李小姐昨日同滬隊選手梁潤森·錢坤格·除再春等諸小姐、在冠生園吃飯、我問她吃的什麼飯、她說「我吃全運飯」記者頗爲費解、後來知道令運飯者即十景飯之別名也、眞難為了李小姐、</p>
<p>錢行素跑那裏城去</p>
<p>女子二百公尺决賽後、報告員大喊「請得分的運動員到司令台前來領獎、」等了好久、祇來了五個女將、獨缺錢行素一人、有謂錢小姐因連日生病、致成績不如人願、處處被李小姐吃　、挫盡了戚風、所以連獎品都不要了、</p>
<p>都說老鄕你好呀</p>
<p>山東·河北·河南·山西等北方選手、相見時、第一句話都說、「老鄉你好呀、」昨日谷得勝跑得萬公尺第一後、一位記者走上去和他握手、也說「老鄉你好呀」聞者大笑不止、</p>
<p>孟小姐說惡形來</p>
<p>孟健麗小姐前日摔角時因撕破馬甲、致昨日報載孟健麗春風洩漏、孟小姐說「惡形得來」要記者代爲更正、前日僅在領下撕破槐、春光未洩云</p>
<p>赤脚大仙眞有種</p>
<p>萬公尺决賽、黑龍江選手盧永豐、跑至中途、忽將跑鞋脫去、赤脚競賽、觀衆呼之為赤脚大仙、且跑着最後一名發令員特為之發槍一響、攝影記者也羣趨包圍、其出風頭不亞於谷得勝、</p>
<h3>大會別記</h3>
<p>全國運動會開幕以來、迄今巳有一週、參觀人數、總計當在三十萬以上、在些三十萬之驚人數目中、據記者之觀察、以城市仕女佔百分之九十以上、鄉村民衆之到會觀光者、環視會塲、除工役之外、幾絕無僅有、縱有之、亦佔極少數極少數而巳、可見運動之與趣、現祇能普及於城市、尚未能深入鄉問去也、</p>
<p>運動塲之來賓座位、分有二角、四角、六角、一元等數級、二元坐位最佳、六角四角次之、兩角坐位、則在運動塲之南北兩端、地位最為惡劣、但覜衆之多、幾無日不告客滿、常使俊來者遍覓挿足之地而不可得、反觀一元坐中、則坐位甚多、但竟無人顧問、於此可見觀衆購票力之薄弱也各項球類比賽、觀衆興趣最為濃厚、而獨於棒球則不然、每場比賽、觀衆寥若晨星、一種冷落景象、令人意興素然、原因何在、蓋山東人吃麥東、一懂不懂之故也、</p>
<p>近三日來、要求選手簽名之風大熾、流行所及、致使維持會塲秩序之童子軍、亦相率人手一冊、伺於會旗之下、俟優勝選手給獎之時、蜂湧而上、歷時甚久、在當事者以為得意、而在觀衆則巳感到不耐煩矣、</p>
<p>萬米第五名桂選手黃瑞文、選手名單上誤作王瑞文、黃君於昨日萬米跑罷、行至播音台前、向報告吳邦偉行一九十度之鞠躬禮後、聲明王黃之誤、聲明畢、復一鞠躬而退、進退有禮、令人起敬、此種精神、各運動員應效法也、被取消資格之女子四百米接力冠軍上海隊選手目右至左焦玉蓮李森錢行素彭愛浦（王開及國際攝）</p>

<p>電界之聲</p>
<h3>長途電話夜間减價辦法</h3>
<p>— 楨</p>
<p>價目較之日間節省十分之三</p>
<p>—自十二月一日起實行—</p>
<p>京滬地段長途電話價目改訂以三分鐘制實行時，曾爲少數用戶誤會，對淤改訂辦法，頗抱不滿。經記者在本刋上期，加以闡明後，想巳釋然矣。惟査歐美各國長途電話有夜間减價之規定，交通部為便利民衆通話省費起見，特仿斯例，制定長途電話夜間减價辦法一種，指定上海，南京，杭州，鎭江，武進，無錫，吳縣，等七處先行試辦，統自十二月一日起實行，如有成效，再行推廣。其價目，一律按照日間價目七折計算。時間自下午八時起，至翌晨六時止。此項時間，以新聞界傳遞新聞消息為最多，足見交通部扶植新聞政策之至意也。</p>
<p>近年以來，交通部主辦之電信業務，以「與衆合作」為第一要義。民衆方面，如有意見，自可儘量陳述，交通當局，如認為有理由時，無不樂予接受，力求改善，以慰羣望。觀於夜間减價電話之創行，信而有徵，此種誠意合作之精神，自無往不利也。若不經以上述程序，開誠相與，而加以臆斷，播為口說，則阻撓交通政策，不無嫌疑，似非領導社會奢所出也，有識君子，想不河漢斯言。</p>
<h3>交部編訂藏交電碼之意義</h3>
<p>— 淸華</p>
<p>最近交通部應甘靑康三省調査專員格桑澤仁之請，特爲編訂藏文電碼一種，便利康藏電訊交通。該項電碼業於本月七日在南京公開試騐，聞結果甚佳，不久將在康藏諸電台正式實用·吾儕對於此項電碼之編訂，不能以其與吾大部介國人無茶關係而漠視之，實則其意義殊為重大，可得而述者有三：</p>
<p>（一）改進電報傳遞文字方法電報為通訊之利器，其使命乃將文字由此地傳達彼地，是以電報符號必須能直接傳遞文字，方可獲得「簡捷」之功效。歐美各國及日本文字，多係用字母拚成，故祇須規定每一電報符號代表一個字母，卽可逐字傳遞毫無困難。惟獨我國文字分漢滿蒙回藏五種，其中以漢文應用最多，但以組織上與歐文逈然不同，不能用符號代替筆盡挨次傳遞，故不得巳用四個數碼代替一字，每一電報須翻譯電碼二次，間接傳遞文字，使電報效率大减，誠屬缺憾！交部此次編訂藏文電碼以藏文與歐文組織類似，所不同者，字母之上下，時有各種符號加註，但其字母總數為四十二個，符號共計有十七個，總共字母及符號五十九個，較之羅馬字母雖多山一倍，但在電報技術上，尚可勉强將電報符號分配與五十個藏文字母及符號，故直接傳遞文字之目的，乃得達到，實為我國電報史上闢一新紀元焉！（漢文用註音符號或羅馬字國音代替，亦可直接傳遞文字，不久卽將試行）</p>
<p>（二）便利康藏民衆通訊國邊陲之處，交通原極簡陋，近數年來政府始漸注意，如西藏之拉薩，西康之康定巴安甘孜德格等處，均巳先後設立電台，但民衆利用之通訊者，仍屬寥寥，此雖大半由於民智未開，但電報不能傳遞藏文，亦爲要因之一。（康藏各政教機關，現有暫編數碼代替藏字，以資傳遞者，但普通民衆無此碼本，電臺方面亦無正式碼本，代為翻譯，故康藏民衆除識漢文或英文者外，實無法拍寄電報。）藏文電碼實行後，電台可以收發藏文電報，康藏民衆從此亦得享受用電報之利益，在此康藏交通梗阻，郵路稀少之時，其意義之重大，為何如哉？</p>
<p>（三）團結康藏鞏固國防我國自推翻遜淸專制以來，號稱五族共和，但實際上政府當局胥以漢人爲多，二十餘年來對於滿蒙回藏四族同胞，雖無顯著之歧視，但聽其自生自滅，不圖團結，實屬無可諱言。年來中央對於康藏，力謀團結，乘此時機，政府方面亟應發展康藏交通，俾康藏與本部各省往還便利，密切聯絡，以達團結之目的。惟發展康藏交通，以經濟及時間言，當以發展電信交通為先，蓋開關公路，建築鐵道，需費旣鉅，需時又久，惟電信則費省易舉，如在康藏內部多設電台，則不僅康藏內部得以密切聯絡，卽與其他各省亦不致隔膜疏遠。將來藏文電報開放後，藏人於國覺　訊便利之餘，必能因此深切了解政府當局重視西陲之意，而益增圑結之心，此則編訂藏文電碼之又一意義也！</p>
<h3>一張電報中可以有多處收報地名嗎</h3>
<p>— 驊</p>
<p>請政軍機關注意改正</p>
<p>每一張電報，照章祇准有一處收報地名，若是有兩張回文電文，發致兩處地方，那末和兩張電文不同的電報完全一樣，必須把它分別書寫，絕對不能把兩個收報地名併在一張電報裏。這個理由很簡單，因為電報和郵信相同，你可以在一封信上寫兩處地名，交郵局分送兩處收信人嗎？迄是任何人都會答道：「不可以的，」那末郵信如此，電報也何獨不然！這是稍有常識的人都容易了解的。</p>
<p>可是歷來政軍機關因襲了傳統的習慣，往往在一張電報中羅列了多處的收報地名，交電局拍發，分送各地收報人，電局對於這種電報，往往發生意外的糾紛，和不可避免的錯誤。例如最近轟動蕪親的米商控訴電局一案，（詳情見本刊四十三期）就因為發報機關——安微省政府——把多處地名併在一張電報裏，以致收報電局——蕪湖局——誤會延途，發生涉訟法院的怪劇。若是發報機關把數處收報地名分開拍發，决不會發生誤會，也不致延途了！當然，在政軍機關未能把種習慣革除以前，這種誤會，隨時有發生的可能。不用說：這興電局和政軍機關方面是一種很大的損失。</p>
<p>多處地名的電報，除了上面所說的誤會延途之外，還有接轉電局漏轉和重轉的危險。原來電報的經轉路由往往因為電路障碍的關係，時常變遷。所以接轉電局遇有多處地名的電報，往往以為某處收報地名應歸某局接轉，毋須再發。但是某處電局恰巧因為通某局的電路發生障碍，沒有收到，以致發生漏轉。反之，有些辦事過於謹愼的電局，往往把應歸某局經轉的電報，仍舊照發，以致發生重轉，重途情事，這又是電局方面一種不可避免的錯誤，而予政軍機關一種不利的結果。</p>
<p>其實，發報機關用複寫紙多寫幾份電報，在手續上並沒有多大麻煩。若是因爲通告的性質，必須要使某處知道同時通知某某等處的，那末在電文要可以分別叙明，或是用一種規定的標識，並沒有絲毫困難，我想政軍機關當局明瞭了上面所說的利害關係，一定能够和電局切實合作，迅速改正，為官軍電報闢一新紀元。</p>
<h3>全運會臨時電報局參觀記</h3>
<p>— 韋立</p>
<p>舉國矚望的第六屆全國運動會，已於十月十日在上海市中心區運動塲開幕了！</p>
<p>國內外各地到上海參觀全運大會的觀衆，人山人海！為數何止十萬？</p>
<p>但是還有無數萬不能趕到上海參觀的國內外同胞，正在引頭長望，等待着此次大會的消息！</p>
<p>我們知道傳遞運動消息的方法，只有電報是最快捷準確了！</p>
<p>交通部為提倡體育起見，特在大會會場設立了一個臨時電報收發處，記者前往參觀，承該處主任趙萃如先生殷勤招待，略記所見，以饗讀者！</p>
<p>全運會塲臨時電　發處設在會塲西門廳右首三號。記者走　全運會塲西大門口向北第三個半圓洞，就望見「上海電報局臨時收發處」和「臨時郵政局」的藍底白字琺瑯招牌。郵局和電局是合設在一間雙開間的屋內。進門是櫃檯，左手是郵局，佔地三分之一，電局地位佔三分之二。櫎內卽為電報房，所裝機器均為最新式，計有克利特　孔機Creed　Keyboard座，每分鐘可打三百至三百五十個字母；韋氏鑒孔機一座，每分鐘可打一百三十至，一百五十個字母，打字電報機Teleprinter一座，雙方可直接用字母收發，不必先鑿成紙條，其運用及式樣與普通打字機無異，每分鐘可收發二百五十至三百個字母；韋氏收發報機一座，每分鐘可收發四百五十至六百個字母。</p>
<p>據說該處每天要發出會塲硬性新聞達二十一處，都有數十萬言之多，其他軟性新聞，各報社新聞，私務電報，交際電報，共在數百通以上，其繁忙情形，可想而知！凡全國各直達綫路，均可由上海電報局接通與該處直接通報。故會塲消息向外傳遞之快速，已無倫比！大會新聞隨時均可發途至人國各地。該處工作人員除主任一人外，有收報員三人，譯電員二人，發報員七人，報　三人，可隨時分途會塲各處運動選手的　報。所有往來電報，均可達到最快速準確的程度。</p>
<p>該處每日收電時問自上午九時至下午九時，在　十二小時問，櫃上拍發電報之主顧，絡繹不絕，大有山陰道上應接不暇之勢。蓋有優待運動選手發電辦法，選手拍電以交際電論，每通僅收費四角，其價之廉，僅及原價百分之二十，在航空信資之下；且隨拍隨到，故各省市迎動選手多就該處拍發報告行止，起居，運動消息，並答謝親友視賀之電報。大會觀衆　該處拍發祝賀選乎之電報者亦甚擁擠。記者前往參觀時，正值該局各員工作緊張之時，莫不埋首工作，機聲紙聲與會塲歡呼聲相應，發出一種天然的音樂，間為悅耳！據聞有某隊女游泳選手接獲觀衆所發之交際賀電最爲衆多。於此可見國人對於全運大會提倡體育的意義，已有深刻的認識，而能利用電報，以省書信之煩，尤為吾人生活上之一大進步！觀衆出入會塲經過門口者，必駐足而望，深讚電信東業之進步，確巳日益便利民衆！記者參觀之後，覺得該處旣樹郵電合設的模楷，復能為運動選手及民衆，忠實努力服　，難怪能博得民衆的良好印象啊！至此，記者遂興辭而出。</p>
<h3>臨時收發處表門</h3>
<h3>臨時收發處內部光景</h3>
<h3>「報告人」</h3>
<p>— 高龍生作</p>
<h3>英美等國電報情形及其發達原因</h3>
<p>— 李季淸</p>
<p>記者在國內各處交通機關及電報局服務十七八年，對於電報，引為終身職業，極感興趣，上年底奉派到美，在各電報及無綫電公司內實習考査，歷時八月餘，對於美國各處電報情形，曾作詳細之研討，嗣赴加拿大各處電報公司考査，其辦理狀　，亦知大概，本年八月間，由紐約到倫敦，卽赴吳國郵電總局，大東電報公司及馬可尼無綫電公司等觀察調査，十一月初將赴丹京柯本海舉之大北電報公司觀査，將來經德比法意諸邦返國，均擬沿途在各電報及無綫電公司參觀，藉知一切情形，茲將美英雨國書報辦理狀况及其發達之原因，分述如左，以供國內闈心電報事業者之參考：</p>
<p>（一）美國</p>
<p>美國各種事業，均係商游，政府處於監督地位，不參加辦理，電報其業亦不出此例，均由私人集股經營，在此原則之下，美國之私人雷報及無綫電公司，故爲數極多，如西方聯合電報公司Western　Union　Telegraph　Company，郵信雷報公司Postal　Telegraph　Company，美國無綫電交通公司Radio　Corporation　ofAmerica馬凱無綫電公司MachayRadio　Company太平洋水綫電公司，Commercial　Pacific　Cable　Company，全美無綫電公司All　America　Cable　Compay及環球無綫電公司Glcbe　WiielessCompany等，均收發各種電報，競攬業務，彼此競爭之結果，故方法新穎，雷報之使用，普逼於各界民衆，惟各公司競爭旣烈，在辦事方法及電報價格方　，每致互相發生衝突，而與各方面，均無利益，壞此情形，對於美國整個電報事業，將來恐有重大之影響，因此美國政府有　及此，特在草盛頓召集各公司代表會商補救辦法，務使各公司勿為過甚之競爭，而影響於美國之整個電報事業，於必要時政府加以統制，將各公司酌量歸　，亦有甚多之可能性。</p>
<p>美國各電　及無綫電公司平時難係商辦，然遇對外國作戰時，則按照美國法律，各公司均由政府管理，統一指揮，平時各公司亦不輕易令外界入內，以防洩　電報消息，此事美國政府曾頒有法律，限制甚嚴，各公司均須嚴爲遵守。</p>
<p>美國各電報及無綫電公司之房屋，設備及所用機器，皆極完美新穎，公司雖多，然均有相當報費收入，因此除各項開支外，尚可有餘欵，以謀其發展，若設備不善，機器陳舊，則任何一公司决難在此劇烈競爭之局面下，圖諜生存</p>
<p>（二）英國</p>
<p>英國電報事業，與我國相同，由政府經營其辦理之機關為郵電總局，該局性質如我國之交通部，所以英國郵政，電報，及電話等事業，均由該局主辦，惟英國亦有一商辦之電報及無綫電公司，辦理國際電報，該公司卽名為水綫及無綫電公司Cable　and　Wireless　Co．與我國電政史有關係之大東水綫電報公司，卽為該公司之一部份，該公司受政府之監督與郵政總局密切聯絡，互遞電報，此外在倫敦及他處並有美國西方聯合電報公司，商務水綫電報公司及丹麥大北電報公司之分公司存在，惟該公司祇限收發國際電報，且受美政府法律上之種種限制。</p>
<p>英國之電報事業，亦極發達，性質雖為官辦，所用辦事方法，極為商業化及民衆化，其設備一切，與美國各電報公司相較，似無遜色，惟英國之民族性，稍較守舊，因此有若干設備，似無美國公司之新穎，數年以前英國郵電總局曾派人員赴美國各公司考察調査，歸而仿行，因此辦事情形，大致與美國相同。　（待續）</p>
<h3>檢查廣播無綫電收音機之意義</h3>
<p>— 儲</p>
<p>自從交通部通令各地電報局派員檢查廣播無綫電收音機以來，已經快兩月餘矣。聞各地收音機裝戶對於此事明悉眞相，聽憑檢査，毫不留難老固多。但不知底蘊，心存疑慮，因之設詞拒絕者，亦不在少數。遂使此項工作之進行，不無窒碍。現在記者特將交通部之所以要檢査各地收音機之綠故，略爲闡述，故寫在後面，　使公衆咸能明瞭此事之眞相，以祛羣疑。</p>
<p>交通部命令各地電報局檢査收音機用戶，其主旨據記者所悉，不外下列二項：第一，是爲裝戶　安全。交部旣負管理全國廣播電信事業之責，自應盡其力之所及，為收聽廣播電信之公衆　安全。因為鑒於各廣播收音機裝戶對於電學常識，多無門徑，以致將天綫任意裝置，往往有接近電話電報　燈及其他電力綫路情事，或其引入屋內之天綫，並不裝接避電器，所以常會擾亂報話通訊，或發生電燈綫與天綫絞搭等危險。譬如，兩月以前，南京豐富巷某姓家便發生過天綫與燈絞搭情事，幸査覺尚早，未釀巨禍。所以各電局收音機檢査員檢査時，對於天綫之裝置，是否妥善？天綫引入綫綫路是否安全？均加注意，如有不妥，立卽予以指導改正，以免發生危險。第二，是防止收音機裝戶私設電臺。裝置廣播收音機者，往往良莠不齊，其中難免有不良份子，營私牟利，利用廣播無綫　收音機登記辦法，以圖取巧。表面上報裝收音　以曚蔽視聽，而暗中却是偸天換日，私設電　，作秘密通信的勾當，以破壞國營電信事業。所以必須派員前往各戶逐一檢査，其所裝之機件是否與登記者相符，內部裝軒有無變更，作為發報或發話之用，藉以防杜流弊。由此觀之，交通部之施行收音機檢査，一方面是為裝戶謀安全，一方面是為保護國營雷信事業，目的極純正而簡單，對於裝戶祇有利而無弊，可不言而喻矣！</p>
<p>至於此種檢査工作，在裝設廣播無綫電收音機登記暫行辦法第四條內早有規定，並非是臨時頒行。所有擔任此項檢査工作之人員，均係富有電信學識之技術人員，態度和藹，辦事廉敏，决無騷擾公眾之舉。且彼等出外執行職務之時候，均隨身佩帶證章，以資識別。全盡義務，絕不需索分文。作者希望各地收音機裝戶讀過此文之後，均能了然於交通部施行收音機檢査之意義，以後對於各電局派員前來檢査時，儘可推誠相與，不必再有何種疑慮存在胸中！</p>
<h3>英倫話費之减低</h3>
<p>— 記者</p>
<p>英國電話價目，聞在業，情形許可之下，自十月一日起，實行大量减低。倫敦市之　綫業務，每季話費由一鎊十二先令六便十，减為六先令。而各地（格拉斯哥，伯明翰，利物浦，曼澈斯德，除外。）之話費，前為一鎊七先令六便士，現减為一鎊，團體業務與營業之價目，亦有相當之减低云。</p>
<p>上項電話减價之損失，在本年度內，約七十五萬鎊，明年度內約一百五十萬鎊，但一般相信，此種政策，不但能使話務發展，有助於商業繁榮，且能獲得重大效益，增加電話吹入也。</p>

<h3>滬畸水綫阻斷的期間</h3>
<p>— 索毅</p>
<p>自九月十五日起，上海到長畸之海底水綫阻斷，旬日後纔經派輪修復。</p>
<p>所謂水綫，卽將通電流之導綫沉入汪洋大海中，兩端上岸，引入局內，藉以通報，偶或發生障碍，修理工作，非常煩重。先要測量，以測知出發生障碍的地方，再派修綫輪船到海中去修，遇到天陰下雨或是有風浪之時，修理工作，更不易舉行。故遠跨重洋之海底電綫發生阻斷，電局損失不貲。但一經阻斷，電報不通，商家蒙受莫大彩嚮。</p>
<p>在滬畸水綫中阻時，上海到長畸或是日本其他地方之報務如何疏連，值得吾人注意者也。</p>
<p>交通部上海國際電　，有直逹東京綫路，所以國際電壹，能擔任此項工作，能補救上述水綫缺憾。不怕大風大雨，不怕高山崇嶺，更無電綫阻斷的憂慮，盡夜二十四小時，都可以通報，商家途去一張電報，國際電臺便立刻發出無綫電波浪，無綫電波浪，好比地球上的空氣，無處不有，它可以立刻傳到通信的他端，便可以收而為報了。</p>
<p>滬畸水綫阻斷時期，以前上海到長畸經水綫傳遞的電報，都途到國際電臺去拍發。平時，國際電毫使用一部發報機擔任發報，一部收報機擔任收報，因滬畸水綫阻斷，來去報務異常　擠，便開出雨部大電力發報機擔任發報工作，用兩部收報樓擔任收報工作，所以在水綫阻斷期間，因為國際電毫設備完善，商　非但絕無躭課，而且，反面迅速了！</p>

<h3>廢婢運動</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>近聞香港反對蓄婢會，定十四日至二十日，舉行廢婢運動宣傳週，前日發出宣言，請各社團報館敎會學校等，合力　勷，以期婢制得以消滅。此舉是極可喜的。</p>
<p>蓄婢在我國甚為普遍，中等以上家庭，大部分皆有使用婢女。原因一般有錢人，生活旣優裕，一切家務，自己當然不願操作，而得有人來代理。他們家裏，蓄用一二婢女，以備喚使。舉凡家中日常雜役，皆命婢女工作。為婢女的，着實苦命。每日早起晚息，一天忙得連喘氣的空隙也沒有。此種牛馬奴隸的生活，常將一個婢女的一生，斷送凈盡。</p>
<p>做婢女的還有一層苦處，卽有時要遭主任的虐待。每見一班為人主者，其對待婢女，簡直不以人看待，百般殘酷。凡事稍不稱意，便聲色俱厲，打罵兼施，心胸惡毒的，甚至加以非人道的慘刑。自來社會上婢女被虐待致傷致死的情形，並不希罕。不久天津曾發生一起某小姐虐待婢女案，最近上海也喧鬧一樁同樣的事件。此不過是一例子而已，同類的事實，多得不可勝計。</p>
<p>蓄婢是一種奴隸制度。此處我們不想提出什麽男女平等或女子人格等問題來說。我們懷疑的是，在人類文明進於相當程度的今日，此種制度，可否有存在的理由？何况蓄婢又是一種人身買賣，此於人道法令，均有違背。大凡家庭蓄用婢女，都是以金錢典來或買來的。一班窮苦人家，因迫於家計，常將自己的女兒，典賣富人為婢女。婢女在此情形之下，便成為貨物，其遭遇的不幸，更覺十分可憫。故我們以為蓄婢制度，是應該廢止的。</p>
<p>至蓄婢制度，需用什麽方法去廢止？此在積極方面，應由政府當局，立訂一種法律，取締人民蓄婢，違者處罰。在消極方面，須先從救濟婢女入手。蓋一種制度的成立，旣有其歷史的關係，一時甚不易推翻。因此，在蓄婢制度未能根本禁止之先，社會上對於婢女，須予以同情，設法改變其注意。又應創辦一婢女救濟所，以收容一般不願為婢或被虐待的婢女，使他們能脫離奴隸地位。廢婢運動，更是必要之舉。像此番香港反對蓄婢會舉行的廢婢運動，其意義是重大的，各方面應努力贊助，俾得達消滅婢女制度的目的。</p>
<h3>恐怖</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>還鄉瑣記</p>
<p>我終於到家了。</p>
<p>晚上，在還算明亮的燈光下（我猜　燈只有大年夜才點過？）我用着多感的眼色端詳那座老屋子，那座老神龕，那褪了漆的長凳，以及褪了色的春聯，它們跟父親一樣，都是歷盡了人世間的風霜，都老了。兩扇街門嚴嚴地關住，至使我想起了十年前的情景。那時候，門外廣闊的土埕中這時一定揚着小孩子們的歌聲，大人們亦揮着扇子，跟鄰右談着閒話。而現在外面却是一片死寂，一點亦聽不到快樂的小孩們的歌聲，這時這劇有誰能相信呢？</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>人散了後，燈亦撲滅了，霜白的月光浸着屋簷，秋蟲滋意地唱着一些不爲人所知的歌曲。桌上小小的淸油燈的火燄在風中搖動着，它射在年老的父親的臉上，使對面壁上印上了一個又大又朦朧的影子·最後，他終於用着低而無力的聲音說：</p>
<p>「鄉中一年不如一年了，你亦應該扶持弟妹們了，這裏現在實在再住不得！」我正要問，他又喀喀地乾嗽起來，我慌忙倒了一杯茶給他，接着他又說：</p>
<p>「譬如一聲……」他又嗽起來了。家里許久沒用過猪油下菜，今晚破例用了，所以他老人家亦就喀得特別厲害。</p>
<p>「一聲現在還不知死活，被保衛團帶到縣里去巳快一年了。因為開公路佔了他的田，又不賠他的錢，咳，田地就是作田人的命……」他停了停，我却說不出一句話來。「現在一聲嫂亦苦够了，四個小孩，二個女兒，又都是白吃飯不會幹活的小妖精，他家去年種柑，心想可以多賣幾個錢還債，殊不知小心了一年，結局三個柑只賈一個柑的價，聽說什麽罐頭工廠關門的綠故哩。咳，這年頭，眞是！」</p>
<p>他呷了一口茶，在沉默里，這空闊的堂屋更覺陰森起來了，我呆呆地聽着，腦海里湧著一個誠實的鄉下種地人的臉，多麽和善，多麼可親，而現在却不知生死……</p>
<p>「現在盜匪亦多了，有些盡綁有身分的人，有些却只跟保衛團作對頭，夜里時常鬧出一些命案，你亦不要在家久住了吧！」</p>
<p>於是父親的口咡動的時候，我彷彿坐在電影院里，眼前，那些孤苦的人，被風雨剝削了的臉，紅腫的眼睛，以及鐵一樣硬的胸肺；還有破毀的家，破毀的田地，破毀的東樹園，是熟識的是陌生的，全在眼前奔跑過去，中間亦有火，血，號陶與吶喊以及……</p>
<p>突然，我們注意到大吠聲又遠而近，由稀而密，由低而高起來了，我們小心地聽，聚精會神的聽，這顯然有了變故！父親慌忙站了起來，渾身都在戰抖</p>
<p>「玄，玄，趕…快…！」他只是抖着身子，說不出下半截的話。</p>
<p>步聲漸漸近了，而且非常噪什，我連忙用手把小燈滅了。</p>
<p>有人打門了！父親一面扯着我，一面顫聲的問：</p>
<p>「是誰？」</p>
<p>「是我，大爺……還沒有睡呵！咳！咳！……」</p>
<p>「你是給與嗎？」父親已聲音洪亮一點了。「進來喝杯茶吧。外面有什麼消息嗎？」</p>
<p>「我還有公車哩，聽說三少爺回來了，我想今晚還是讓他到別處去吧。剛才團部來電話，說是外面水緊得很哩。咳…咳，」一他一面嗽着說，接着就動身走了。</p>
<p>「啊！父親嘆了一口氣，許久說不出話來，我們靜　地聽着他們的步聲遠了。才緩緩地坐下來。</p>
<p>歇一歇，明天再商量吧，今夜就到草寮裏去過一夜吧，我看這樣子還穩當一點。」父親說。</p>
<p>我只得聽他們的話，打着燈籠走山問門迎面吹過來的風　着土的氣息，亦帶着醉人的稻香。鄉村的周圍都很靜寂了，只有遠處蕩來一陣陣的犬吠聲，其問亦間有一二嚮槍聲，那是守夜的人的暗號，無垠的原野掩上一層霜白的月光；在月光下，我隱約地看見遠處有一座巨大的，半為黑暗所吞沒的碉樓，這在十年前是沒有的，十年前這時侯原野里小孩們正提着小燈籠去捉蟋蟀同螢火蟲哩。</p>
<h3>多跳一次舞，多救一條命？</h3>
<p>— 陳靜生作</p>
<h3>墓前</h3>
<p>— 胡慰雄</p>
<p>是孩子的週年祭。</p>
<p>隔夜我故意高與地邀妻瞧電影，影片是個喜劇，我的意思是想藉外來的刺激使妻忘了那個難忘的日子吧。從電影院散塲出來，我們沒有坐車，緩緩地步行歸家；在途中我提起那同一主角從前我們所看過的影片，講起許多他們獨特的笑料，妻似乎很高興，沒有談起孩子的事。歸家已是午夜了，</p>
<p>但是妻並沒有忘了孩子週年祭的日子。她憂鬱地說：這是第一年，我們應該到他墓前去，他是等着我的！她說着幾乎流淚了。母愛是天性的，而妻更是特別喜歡孩子，不論人家的自己的，她見了孩子總是搶來抱抱·當她告知我懷孕的時候，我從沒有見她那樣高與的樣子：她買了許多關於產前衛生的書籍，每天照着書上的條例實行，同時忙着剪裁孩子的衣服，製辦孩子的用具，彷彿她是為了孩子而生存的。</p>
<p>產後她得了病，但爲育兒須知的指示，她反對僱佣乳母，她不辞辛勞把扶餋孩子的責任負起來。在孩子剛　語的时候，妻神經过敏地把他咿啞咿啞的聲音解釋了各種言語，偶或有一聲姆媽似的語音，他就告訴人家我的孩子會說話了……</p>
<p>但是去年秋天，一個細雨濛濛的晚最後一面。他廢寢忘食，幾乎發狂似的渴念着孩子：他把孩子的衣服玩具都收拾在一架小橱中，每天像一個瘋子似的揣摹着這件那件，自語着「這是孩子的…」時常半夜里驚醒，告訴我孩子回來了；雖然她明知是做夢，總是像眞有這般事地為我細細解釋她在什麼地方看見孩子，或是孩子對她怎樣，直要疲乏不能支持的時候才繼續睡去。</p>
<p>自己同樣是愛孩子的，他突然息病逝世，我的心中悵然若失。但為了解除妻子的憂鬱，我强顏歡笑解勸她。每個假日，我摒絕了朋友們的酬酢，陪伴着妻到野外去開擴她的心胸。或者看滑稽電影，强壓了自家的情感，使妻漸漸地從悲痛中蘇醒過來。</p>
<p>最近來，雖然她瞧見人家的孩子的時候總惦念着，但她已不那樣固執，她接受了醫生的勸告，如果她憂鬱成了病，號就永不會生孩子了！她的起居飲食已如沒有孩子以前的上軌道了，把孩子的遺物责數收集起來，藏在避匿的地方，她說：從此要忘了孩子</p>
<p>但是她沒有忘了孩子的週年祭，我們買了一束鮮花到他墓前去。秋天的早上，高亢而寂寞，晨風銳利地拂着，更顯得墓前的凄凉了久我們並立在孩子的墓前，妻不由地放聲大哭了，彷彿她受了什麼寃屈似的。我呆立着，我沒有流涙，我能强止情感的奔放，也不勸止妻，由她盡性的一哭罷，否則她要掛念孩子而變成疾病的。</p>
<p>在太陽偶而探露出牠光芒來的的候，我返身向全墓塲巡視，每一個墓碑上凝貯着的露水，反射着金色的光芒，好像每一個歡笑的臉一樣，安睡在墓穴中每一個靈魂他們已經遺忘了人世間的痛苦吧？我將這意思告知了妻，她仰起頭來說：我的眼眶也反射着金色的光芒呢</p>
<h3>跛丐</h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>他天天躺在這破敗的更樓底卜，二十多年來不曾看見他離開過；這副龍鍾老態的身體，却沒有生過一回病，這也許是「無眼野猪天照應」吧。</p>
<p>這更樓就在我家隔壁，他時常到我家來討些殘羹冷飯，他帶便帮我們看門，遇到有客人來，他便會代我們回復，或問來者的姓名，而且差不多我們每一個親戚或朋友他都認識。</p>
<p>討飯和別的呌化不同，出門不帶打狗捧，見人不叫娘娘太太，到東到西只挾着一隻破碗，兩根毛竹筷，不管天晴下雨，春夏秋冬，總是赤着一雙脚，他不懂唱什麼二簧調，嘴裏祗喃喃有詞的，像唸佛也像駡人，還不知道他在禱告些什麼？今日前村喜慶，明朝後巷喪事，人家雖不通知他，但無論路遠或路近，天晴或天雨，他準會大駕光降準時趕到，自然半盃殘羹，一碗冷飯，人家也决不會讓他失望的。</p>
<p>我很想打聽他的身世，但是問到他的時候，他總是茫然不知所答。有次外祖母到我家來，講述了一些關於他的歷史。</p>
<p>在若千年前，我們門前港裏曾來了一隻小網船，船的主人是一對中年夫婦，他們就在這裏捕魚，捉蝦，和替人家挖淤泥度日，過了一年，船上添了一個又白又胖的孩子。</p>
<p>在孩子十歲光景，是一個夏天，他們夫婦倆同時染着時疫，相繼丟着這孩子去世了；於是，他從此就成了個無父無母的可憐孩子。不久那隻小網船也因年久失修無人收管而沉到了水底下去。</p>
<p>孩子沒有親，沒有眷，他這末小小的年紀，自己又不會去找生活，因此就靠人家這些殘羹剩飯給他過活，晚上便宿在這更樓底下，到如今　算起來足足有五十多年了。</p>
<p>當他走進這更樓的時候，這更樓還是新的，而且這巷裏的主人也正是顯赫一時的朝廷大員，現在顯宦的下代亦不知所終，巷子的主人換了一位商入。但他却依舊守在那裏，雖那更樓已敗頹不堪，而却還能够遮　雨露。</p>
<p>至於他的跛脚是在三十年前，因巷裏失竊，那些豪奴惡僕便疑心到他身上，把他去私刑拷打的硬要他招承，一隻脚給他們打跛了！等到水落石出，發現這竊案的主犯却不是他，而是那主人的侄子所幹的，可楚他已經是殘廢的了。聽到外祖母述及他的歷史，我心中悵然若失。</p>

<h3>大家開壩去</h3>
<p>—「凱歌」中的一塲面—</p>
<p>一天巳是乾旱到這樣地步了，再過幾天若不下雨，不是什麽都完了嗎？我們現在唯一辦法，也只有齊心恊力夫開壩，什麼求龍王爺，那簡直全是鬼話，我們不能相信它，要知道世界上什麽事情都要靠自己的……」。</p>
<p>「好的，先生！我們大家開壩去。」</p>
<p>這裏是由龍王廟改成的一所「農民子弟小學」的課室，衆多農民學生都在教昌魏鶴齡所提的關於救旱的辦法下，舉手贊成了。</p>
<p>「要去我們現在就去，你們先回家去吿訴爸爸和哥哥？呌大家提一切開壩工具在周家壩聚……」。</p>
<p>魏鶴齡這樣向衆生吩咐了以後，衆生便歡呼着各自回家呌爸爸哥哥，及携農具去了。而他自己則帶同王引先到周　壩去察勘地點。</p>
<p>這是藝華公司卜萬蒼導演的「凱歌」中的一個塲面。因空氣配得非常緊張，情緒又非常熱烈，故無疑地它是「凱歌」中的精彩演出之一了。</p>
<h3>「都市風光」兩新人—唐納張新珠</h3>
<h3>第一部五彩立體長片「浮華世界」公映</h3>
<p>自從電影由默片轉變爲有聲以來，再沒有遭受到如此嚴重之革命，似所謂「新色」立體攝製New　Technicolor了。可是彩色的嘗試，已具悠久的歷史，而運用着三原色　以攝取物象使它在銀幕上現出純粹的自然的淸晰的活潑的一切色彩，同時因爲異綫較深之故，人物亦不作平面形而成立體，吾們應該如何贊揚這個科學的最新最妙之賜予，美國雷電華公司，因上年以三原色攝影的試騐品五彩歌舞短片「痴情舞伴La　Cucura　fa」意外地成功，獲得電影藝術科學院特獎，博取世界一致的推許，於是煞費經營，選定英國大文豪惠廉薩克萊氏香艶名著「浮華世界」，以書中女主人貝姬莎布Becky　Sharp（按原名據此）之一生浪漫專蹟，旁及當時法國怪傑拿破崙英國宮庭問史迹編製成劇，聘由天才大明星曼琳霍金絲主演，耗驚人的鉅資與精力，從事於三色五彩長片的創作，今旣在「南京」作初次的公演，其轟動當屬意中，但「浮華世界」並負有第八藝術第二次大轉變的使命，不僅獨其藝術上最高估值之娛樂品而巳。</p>

<h3>拿登機車成績驚人</h3>
<p>— 敷</p>
<p>拿登機車素以機械精良。速率高超。著名於世。歷來參加各項競賽。無不名列前茅·榮獲錦標。茲據本埠經售商別廉車行接得廠方消息。一九三五年度之低級及高級旅行競賽。以及歐洲境內所舉行之Grand　Prix競賽。勝利仍均屬諸拿登。其成績之優異。殊足使人驚奇艷羨。稱道不置。</p>
<p>按初級及高級旅行賽錦標。連續為拿登機車所奪得者。已共達四年之久。故當此項初級賽舉行之初。一般人士。頗有以為拿登未必仍能保持其冠軍位置者。然而結果拿登除獨佔前三名位置外。於某次賽程中。且竟包辦前四名焉。至於鄧肯君之名列第七。則撞車所致也。</p>
<p>當第一圈告終時。格思利君以每小時七八·九九英里之平均速度。居前領導。至其餘正式參加之拿登機車三輛。則緊隨於其後。及至第二圈時。前四名位置。仍為此四輛拿登所分佔。而當前疾馳者。並仍為格思利君。當斯時也。其平均速度。已達每小時七九·〇五英里。嗣更進至第三圈。各車位置。依然毫無變動。惟於此有最堪注意之一點。阿勒斯克君以二十八分十九秒走畢此圈。其速度竟達每小時八十英里是也。按除拿登外。其餘低級類機車。蓋從未有能到達此種速率者。第四圈中。鄧肯君不幸如上文所述。因撞車而落後。至其餘三拿登。則仍風馳電掣。安抵終點。其名次如下。</p>
<p>第一名　格思利君。時速七九·一四英里。</p>
<p>第二名　勒斯克君。時速七八·七一英里。</p>
<p>第三名　韋脫君。時速七八·一九英里。</p>
<p>此外分組賽錦標，。亦為拿登組所奪得。至於本屆尚屬初次舉行之高級競賽。拿登成績尤為驚人。蓋其平均速率。竟達每小時八四·六五英里也。</p>
<h3>甘勃爾榮歸英倫</h3>
<p>— 虞</p>
<p>如願以償每小時三百英里</p>
<p>著名「藍烏」車命名之由來</p>
<p>聞名世界之汽車賽跑家甘勃爾·麥爾康爵士，頃已達到其最後希望每小時三百英里之速率紀錄，榮歸英倫矣。甘勃爾之正確速率紀錄為陸地每小時三〇一·二九二英里，當賽跑方畢之時，因計時員之錯誤，以為甘勃爾之速率尚未達每小時三百英里，致當時羣為甘氏惜，蓋功虧一簣，所差雖極微細，而終未愜爵土之意也，及至美國汽車協會職員於深夜通知甘氏，謂計時有誤，確已達到每小時三百英里，羣衆咸為甘氏賀，爵土亦衷心偷快，並謂此種錯誤未免「好笑」，甘氏之車行速率，平均為每一英里十二秒鐘，其初甘勃爾尚擬於比賽之翌日，再加一試，以期達到三百英里之目標，及後捷報傳來，卽行打銷前議，摒當行裝，離美返英，其重六噸，馬力二千五百匹之「藍鳥」汽車，亦同歸故鄉焉。</p>
<p>計時員最初計甘勃爾爵士之南行速率，為每小時二九五·五六六英里，平均為二九九·八七五英里，尚未滿三百英里之目的，後又檢査電氣紀時紙帶，其回返之里程為每一英里十二秒又八，並非為十二秒一八，於是卽官佈最初之紀錄為有誤，甘勃爾爵士身材修長，手足矯健，其駕駛之精審，借重於體力不少，蓋亦駕駛家中之具有天才者也，氏生於一八八五年，初役於勞合氏社，為保險業，其時為一九〇四年，直至大戰爆發，始行離去，入伍為航空渡機駕駛員，然此非氏志也，至一九一九年復員，乃去職，旋卽結婚，翌年購置一汽車，於布羅克林作比賽之跑駛。</p>
<p>甘勃爾爵爵之夫人，對於車賽亦威興趣，且能駕駛。一九二一年時。甘夫人思以婦女而從事汽車駛賽。必能引起興趣。乃告甘氏曰，「余將躬身駕車駛賽，以覘君於車賽之興味固何在」一星期後，甘氏返來，語其夫人曰，「下星期六布羅克林之車賽中，余已為汝登記矣」，甘夫人以為尚有充份之練習時間，因語其夫曰，一然則汝當以若車假余，以資練習」，星期六日前，甘勃爾偕其夫人外出，甘夫人駕車駛兩匝，每小時速率為八十英里，渠夫謂伊，此種成績並不甚佳，欲望得標實屬大難，伊經此挫折，心殊不悅，及至比賽之日，甘夫人以努力之結果，每小時逹一百十英里之速率，位居第四，伊於比賽駛車之時，未見有何佳趣趣可言，故不待其母及姑之阻止，伊已自動不再欲加入車賽矣，今則於甘勃爾爵士駛車之時，伊輒在道旁作壁上觀，伊雖不樂為此，而常出席，甘爵土屢告以不必恐懼，甘夫人乃亦努力為之。</p>
<p>甘勃爾爵士所駕而獲得錦標之車，厥名為「藍烏」，其得各之由來，亦頗堪噱，綠某日滴購一汽車，擬往布羅克林作駛車比賽，是晚渠决往觀劇，以資消遣，所演之劇，卽為梅脫林之「藍鳥」，甘勃爾對於此劇欽仰倍至，翌晚卽為比賽之前一晚，甘氏又往觀焉，劇終而返，卽將其所購之汽車，全身漆以藍色，而命名為「藍鳥」，當比賽之日，所漆尚未乾燥，涔涔下滴，甘不之顧，竟獲首獎，自是而後，甘氏每置一車，卽續以「藍烏」名之，誌其佳運也，此次比賽所駕之新藍烏車，長二十八英尺，其尾之形式殊為詭異，其起跑發動時所用之煤氣，中人欲啞，令聞者為之窒息，有若三硝基甲爚燃發時之氣息也。</p>
<p>車上所用之胎輪，事前屢加試騐，以測其能否經此每小時三百英里之强烈磨擦，前後所試之胎輪為數不下四十個，其尺寸為三十七乘八，用絲質及帆布、之襯裥十道至十二道，其外則有薄橡皮為面，比賽之各種用具方式，均依照美國汽車協會比賽組之規程而進行，終點懸有一靶心作紅色，當「藍鳥」之仰鼻式車頭觸及預裝之金屬棧時，卽通達至公正人台上而為正式之紀錄時問，其時間紀錄之工具，為一用電流之紙帶機。</p>
<p>此屆最後之比賽後，甘勃爾爵士將任美國福斯電影公司駐央新聞影片主任，廿氏常置身於新聞影片之中，對此當有相當之經騐可言也，據甘勃爾言。此種賽車之耗費，為數宵屬驚人，渠因年幼時獲有大量之遺產，乃得完成此種工作，又稱當「藍鳥」駛行之時，把舵最為不易，時令手掌起泡，甘氏生平卽以獲得陸上速率紀錄為唯一樂事，而以汽車賽為其私生活工作之一，否則渠將專門從事於發掘藏鑑矣，渠前曾於可古士島費去一二年之光陰，發掘一八二一年時海盜所藏之金銀，共值美金六〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元，結果失敗，此次退休家鄉蘇萊之時。聞仍將以駕車為消遺，但其速率則將最多不過每小時五十英里云</p>
<h3>浙北汽車旅行記（上）</h3>
<p>— 凌雲</p>
<p>本埠西人數輩。於八月下旬駕華克斯好轎車。作浙北旅行。為期一週。對於途程時間。所紀頗詳。爰為多家譯如左。以作參考。</p>
<p>八月二十三日星期五下午一時半。余儕自靜安寺路聖喬治出發。作浙江公路汽車旅行。所駕之汽車為一九三五年式大六缸華克斯好。馬力二十七匹。油櫃中裝有汽油十四加倫。里程表所計為四七四〇英里。途程開始之一百三十三英里。由滬至杭之西湖。凡本埠人士之具有華界車照者。類能道之。茲不贅。但於途中重要地點。仍以日記體依次加以說明。其於時間途程之紀錄。當亦為閱者所欲知也。</p>
<p>由法租界汶林路越徐家匯橋前進。（速度表所紀為四七四二英里）於下午二時十分到達閔行輪渡。其所過之道路。係煤滓路面。崎嶇不平。若單以此點而言。堪為全程道路中之最壞者。三時到達海塘。杭州灣之戢山羣島隱約在望。（四·七七六英里）一刻鐘後。里程表所紀為四·七八七英里。江浙交界之石牌誌已飛越而過。自茲而後。路旁所記之里數。均係自杭州出發而言者。</p>
<p>下午三時四十分抵乍浦。（四·八〇〇英里）此地仍為禁衞地帶。並因海塘狹窄。駕駛不易。華人中曾有危險之事發生。以不習於駕駛故也。第二關隘須檢騐車照者為海鹽。（於下午四時到達。四·八一一英里）檢騐之地為一海角之古廟中。由一禮貌周到之官員。指揮其事。當此塲合。最好除呈騐護照外。再佐以本人之名片。至車照及駕駛照。自更當在呈騐之例。</p>
<p>目下為一小城鎭之澉浦。（西歷八七七年前為世界貿易之大城市。馬可波羅時已經著名）此城鎭位於第二集之小山中。為滬人往杭所過者。經過一百三十三英里之行程。於下午六時三十分到達杭州西湖。（里程表所誌為四·八七三英里）</p>
<p>次日星期六。自杭出發。裝八加侖之汽油後。於晨六時四十五分。經由錢塘江橋而往徽州。（四·八七四英里）自各種地圖上視之。似沿途得見錢江。但實際上則不盡然。殊與理想逈異也。惟所經數地。有為風景絕佳者。兩旁懸崖。中關為路。又見其工程之不易。經過四散之械茶區後。約於上午七時三刻到達富陽。里程表為四八九九英里。於四九〇四英里時。見有若干小山。為景殊美。經松溪河後（四·九一三英里）取道崖路。沿錢江而進。於上午九時半抵桐廬。里程四九三一英里。此地有打獎之小型木渡船。渡人過桐溪河。取費洋一元。但自渡船上下須極經心。因跳板擱置之度數常極峭直也。上午十時。里程四·九四一英里。到達至七里瀧之支路。再經四央里之車行。一英里半之步行。抵嚴子陵鈞壹。此為名垂寰宇之佳勝。為時已歷二千餘年。十一時半重返幹道。里程為四九四九　里，一小時後到達白沙叉道口。（四·七四九英里）靠右一路前進。四九八九英里時過公共汽車站。十三英里前渡河之費。卽在此地徵收。</p>
<h3>狄塞爾引擎發展史（二）</h3>
<p>— 朱義生</p>
<p>如果你的脚踏車輪橡皮胎需要打氣時。經數分鐘的抽打卽覺得氣筩壳子發生熱度。此卽由於內部空氣受到高壓力所致。狄塞爾引擎卽根據此項原理。他的活塞在汽筩中向上頂冒時。筩內的空氣受到强大的壓力。約有每方英寸五百至一千二百磅之鉅。此種受到强大壓力之空氣。同時產生法氏表一千度之熱量。正在此際。那氣筩蓋上預裝之噴油泉。噴射出散霧形的重油一道。頓時因逢到高熱度的空氣而致燃燒。而爆炸而將活塞向下推途。一如汽油引擎之用電火塞以引燒汽油。</p>
<p>因汽筩內空氣壓力之特別高强。所以氣　的構造較之尋常汽油引擎列為堅厚。這就是第一種困難。蓋因之而引擎本身覺到笨重。然而近代冶金術。利用特製合金。及火烘法。巳能將此項難題逐步解决。譬如克敏斯式的引擎。每匹馬力祇佔到十五磅又六之重量。較之尋常汽油引擎之每匹十四磅又九之重量。初無甚軒輊也。</p>
<p>第二種困難。就是因為汽筩中空氣壓力過高。開動殊感不易。尋常汽油引擎一經馬達拖動。卽能自動旋轉。但是狄塞耳引擎根本無須用到電力。自不必專為開車裝置馬達。如果用手搖動。則匪特力不勝任。尤其是在此糜登世界。豈不將貽笑大方。然而際此科學萬能的時代。此項難題自可迎刃而解。譬如引用彈簧也。冷氣也。或離心力飛輪也均可。我人試拭目以待之。</p>
<p>此外困難之點。則重油性剛强。非若汽油之柔靡。用汽油的汽車比較地易於操縱。不過逢到天氣寒凉時節。那狄塞爾引擎就能不受冰凍影響。這是他的特點。</p>
<p>在今日大規模製造的幕後。有一段希奇的事蹟。我人不妨將狄塞爾引擎演進的歷史。逐步逐步的觀察一下。</p>
<p>距今六十五年之前。有名克利香喬其生者。係美之米內亞保利斯城一鐵匠。他可以說是狄塞爾引擎的先祖。他用硬木兩片裝置於引擎汽筩上部。另有機扭使之交相磨擦。發生熱量。同時使受壓迫之空氣燃燒炸烈。然此引擎不過是試騐性質。未切於實用也。其後數年。在西物其尼州有一礦土。名喻物倫者。別出心裁。造一煤粉引擎。當時所異者未用重油耳。經過數年的試騐。頗見成績。可惜厥後汽筩爆烈。那發明家亦不幸而傷重致命。</p>
<p>狄塞爾引擊之命名。實本自他的發明人魯陶夫狄塞爾博士。氏父母均德人。而氏則誕生於法京巴黎。曾負笈攻讀科學於英德兩國專門學校。畢業後。曾一度主管巴黎某冷藏廠。在一千九百八十三年時。他運用匠心。蓄意製造一種特殊的引擎。將圖稿及推算式形諸紙上。越三年而理想方成事實。不過他那時的引擎。亦像哈物倫一般的使用媒粉。結局呢。亦一般地爆炸成為碎片。</p>
<p>可是幸運的狄塞爾博士沒有遭到重大的危險。他從醫院裏出來就計劃用油代煤的試騐。果眞馬到成功。那時有一位美國商人名蒲歇者。就買了他在美國的專利權。</p>
<p>雖則那時節各地的機器工程家。對於他的引擎抱着光明的希望及熟忱。然而狡猾的財主們始終抱着冷觀的態度不與資助。直到一九一二年他的專利權期滿之後。方纔表示投資的興趣。狄塞爾博士覺到世界對待他的慘酷。就在歐戰前一年。投身英法海峽中自殺而死。</p>

<h3>Wang and Kong Arrive in Beijing: Yesterday's Meeting with Chairman Chiang; Discussing Recent Central Political Situation; Dai and Others Visited in Succession</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Chiang left Zhongshan Gate at dawn on the 15th, inspected Lingwei for a week, and then entered the city to meet with Presidents Dai and Ju of the two Academies. President Wang and Vice President Kong returned to Beijing on the morning of the 15th to attend the Executive Yuan meeting, and later visited. In the afternoon, Chiang continued to receive Pei De and others at his official residence. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) President Wang, together with Chu Minyi and Zeng Zhongming, arrived in Beijing by train from Shanghai at 7:00 am on the 15th. After disembarking at the Hepingmen Station, they went directly to their official residence for a short rest. At 8:00 am, they went to the Executive Yuan to preside over a routine meeting. After the meeting adjourned at 10:30 am, they immediately went to the military academy official residence to visit Chairman Chiang and discuss the recent central political situation. They did not leave until 12:00 pm. (15th Central News Agency Electric)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi met with Chiang on the morning of the 15th and then attended a meeting of the Executive Yuan. At noon, he went to his ministry, summoned Secretary-General Li Tang and advisors, and discussed the issuance of disaster relief public bonds. When receiving visitors at one o'clock, he replied: (1) Although our country is a member of the League of Nations, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs represents the country in its external affairs. It is not convenient for me to express my opinion. (2) The rumor that I arranged for Sir Otto Niemeyer to meet with Chairman Chiang is not true. However, as Sir Otto Niemeyer is a British economic expert, it is normal for him to visit our country's leaders. (3) The rumor that civil servants will be required to subscribe to 20% of the disaster relief public bonds is not accurate. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After returning to Beijing on the 14th, Chairman Chiang rested at his residence. It is said that he went out by car on the night of the 14th to inspect the roads of Beijing. On the morning of the 15th, he went to the mausoleum for a walk. Soon after returning to the city, Wang and Kong arrived in Beijing from Shanghai, so he went to the military academy to visit them. Dai and Ju also arrived later, and they talked for a long time. There were many other ordinary guests who came to visit and were scheduled to be received later. At around 1:00 pm, a Ford plane was ordered to fly to Shanghai to pick up Madame Chiang to Beijing. The plane flew back with Madame Chiang that afternoon. Chairman Chiang went to the airport at around 4:00 pm to wait for Madame Chiang to disembark, and then they went to their residence together. In addition, a Boeing plane was ordered to fly to Hankou at 7:00 am on the 15th. (15th Central News Agency Electric)</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador Arima Scheduled to Visit Our Foreign Affairs Authorities</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Japanese Ambassador Arima was originally scheduled to come to Beijing after the Double Tenth Festival to visit our country's foreign affairs authorities to discuss Sino-Japanese diplomatic events. He had already telegraphed our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to schedule a meeting with Foreign Minister Wang. Now, due to staying in Shanghai to meet with Military Councilor Sakanishi, who came to China, and Special Envoy Morishima of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to listen to reports, the departure date has been postponed. According to reports, Arima is scheduled to come to Beijing from Shanghai on the morning of the 20th of this month to pay his respects to our foreign affairs authorities, explain Japan's new policy towards China, and schedule a banquet in Beijing to entertain our foreign affairs officials, hoping to foster goodwill.

<h3>Promoting Domestic Goods Factory Enterprises</h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau has sought to improve the organization of domestic goods marketplaces and has stipulated management methods. All those who organize or collect domestic goods from local manufacturers in the city to hold temporary domestic goods marketplaces or domestic goods exhibitions in other cities must register with the Bureau and abide by its rules. Those who violate the rules will be dealt with. As for domestic goods manufacturers' groups, there are no separate laws or regulations governing their organization, resulting in scattered organization, inconsistent actions, and affecting the progress of their business. Therefore, a meeting will be held today (16th) to petition the Sixth Plenary Session for the promulgation of such laws. Both of these are the beginning of the improvement of domestic goods factory enterprises.</p>
<p>In recent years, domestic goods marketplaces (including domestic goods exhibitions, domestic goods movements, etc.) have emerged one after another. Within one city, they spring up simultaneously in the east, west, south, and north. Within one country, they are held in different provinces and cities, almost becoming "fair-like" and "temple-like." However, the fact that they have penetrated deep into the people is a gratifying phenomenon. However, in order to compete for sales, each factory seeks lower prices and does not mind the poor quality of goods. The appearance is beautiful but not durable. The names of the goods are the same, but the quality varies greatly, which is self-defeating. The handicrafts in various places have been destroyed by foreign goods and are now suffering from the impact of domestic goods factory enterprises. If the products of domestic goods factories can meet the needs of the people, it is still a case of "Chu bow, Chu gain," and the benefits do not flow abroad. If not, it will serve as a counter-advertisement for foreign goods and strengthen the people's desire to buy foreign goods. Goods have fine and coarse qualities, and prices have expensive and cheap ranges. It is impossible to expect them to be uniform. However, there should be corresponding standards between their grade differences. Whether a good is durable and whether it is worth the price paid for it can be judged by comparison. If the price is cheap but not durable, and the price is more expensive but durable, people will naturally choose the latter without being persuaded. Therefore, setting prices for goods must take into account the economics of the user to make plans, so that their sales can be long-lasting. If they rely solely on the power of advertising, do not hesitate to exaggerate and distort the truth. When everything tried is false, not only will they lose the effect of advertising, but they will also incur the resentment of buyers. After that, even if there are good products, people will not believe them. For the sake of the future, domestic goods factories should cherish the glory of the two words "domestic goods" and pay special attention to the truth of domestic goods. Passing off foreign goods as domestic goods to confuse customers is undesirable. Even if the intention is for customers to try it once, it is not a proper way. As for borrowing the name of promoting domestic goods to reap personal fame and gain, as well as poor organization and improper management, leaving customers with a bad impression and causing participating manufacturers unnecessary losses, it will not work without the competent authorities' effective supervision and strict crackdown.</p>
<p>The biggest difficulty currently facing domestic goods factories is still the pressure from foreign goods. Increasing import tariffs cannot prevent the dumping of foreign goods, but will increase the competition for foreign merchants to set up factories locally. Most of the foreign goods that sell well now do not have independent manufacturing plants in Shanghai, but have compounding workshops. The convenience that domestic goods factories have is shared by them. Moreover, they have skilled technology and are good at management, which is far beyond the reach of domestic goods factories. They also have special forces backing them. It seems that domestic goods factories will also share the same fate as handicrafts. The domestic goods factory industry is aware of the dangers of the situation and must unite their front and take consistent steps to resist external encroachment and seek internal unity. If this cannot be done, how can we talk about industrial control?</p>

<h3>American Female Lecturer at Central University Dies Tragically Under Beijige Pavilion: Police Department is Investigating</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) At about 5:00 am on the 15th, soldiers and police discovered the body of a foreign woman on a slope on Xiaochuan Road, Wu Miao Bay, under the Beijige Pavilion. Her head was facing northwest and her feet were facing southeast. They reported to Chief Zhang Mengsong of the Sixth Bureau, who went to the scene to inspect and reported to the Police Department. The Police Department sent personnel to investigate. The female corpse was about 40 years old, wearing a Western-style suit and leather shoes, with a woman's hat, umbrella, and lecture notes left on the ground. Upon inspection, the woman's hat was made in San Francisco, USA, and the lecture notes were in English cursive, with the content being preparatory material for physiology. The investigation revealed that the deceased was the wife of Xu Shiju, a technician at the Ministry of Health. Xu is from Fenghua, Zhejiang, and is currently the Director of the Jiangning Experimental County Health Institute. His wife, originally from California, USA, had the Chinese name Xu Wansuzhen and was a doctor of medicine. Mrs. Xu had been in China for more than ten years and had been a professor of physiology at Qilu University in Jinan for many years. Last year, she married at Yenching University. After marriage, she went to Hunan with her husband and served as a technician at the Health Experiment Office. In early September of this year, she came to Beijing with her husband. Xu held his current position at the Ministry of Health, while Mrs. Xu served as a lecturer at the midwifery school of the Ministry of Health and a lecturer in physiology at Central University. They resided in Tushan Town, Jiangning County. Every Monday afternoon from 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm, Mrs. Xu had classes at Central University. At about 5:00 pm on the 14th, Mrs. Xu left the obstetrics school of Central Hospital. She told her husband that she was going to Central University to teach. Unexpectedly, she did not return all night. The Capital Court Prosecutor's Office sent forensic doctors and examiners to conduct an examination. As a result, only slight marks were found on the deceased's left neck, which were by no means fatal injuries. After consultation between the court and the Ministry of Health, it was decided to transport the body to Central Hospital for an autopsy to clarify the matter. Central Hospital performed the autopsy at about 2:00 pm. Liu Ruiheng, Director of the Ministry of Health, and Baker, the US Consul General in Beijing, personally went to observe. The results of the autopsy will not be clear until the 16th. Chen Zhuo, Director of the Police Department, attached great importance to the occurrence of this case. He invited Xu Shiju to the department to inquire in detail about his wife's situation and strictly ordered his subordinates to investigate so that the truth of the case could be revealed.

Shuyang City is under tight defense, and all city gates have been blocked overnight. The area south of the city is a vast expanse of water, collapsing houses, submerging fields, and sweeping away people, livestock, and other animals.

<h3>The West Bank of the Salt River Continues to Collapse: The Sound of Waves Can Be Heard Inside Banpu Dike</h3>
<p>(Xuzhou) The water level in Banpu, the seat of Guanyun County, has dropped, but the water level in Dayi Mountain has risen sharply. Although water barriers have been built in the streets and lanes inside the dike, the surrounding water level is too high, resulting in excessive water pressure. Water sprouts are surging up in the stone cracks on the streets, threatening to submerge the area. Seven sections of the Chenwei area of the west bank of the Salt River have continued to breach, and the water is flowing towards the territory of Donghai. The area is six li away from Banpu, and the sound of the surging flood can be heard inside the Banpu dike. At the same time, the new embankment on the east bank of the Salt River has also collapsed, with more than 30 li of damaged areas waiting to be built. The Guanyun County Government is transporting sacks to repair it. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) After the Donghai Special Commissioner's Office stipulated the excavation of the Shaoxiang River to discharge the water volume of the Salt River, it was recently measured that the Shaoxiang River was higher than the Salt River.

The diversion canal opened in Xinpu passes through the Yizhong (righteous tomb), and a notice has now been issued to relocate the burial. Work will begin soon. According to general observations, Donghai is downstream of Guanyun. Although the water level in Banpu has dropped, the water is overflowing. If it is not thoroughly discharged and the water is given a place to go, harm cannot be avoided. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Paris Carries Out Diplomatic Reconciliation Efforts. Laval Meets With British and Italian Ambassadors. Asks Italy to Propose Minimum Armistice Conditions. Papal Representative Willing to Mediate.</h3>
<p>(Paris) French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval met today with British Ambassador Clerk, Italian Ambassador Cerutti, and Papal Representative Marion, to seek new efforts to advance world peace. It is understood that Britain has agreed not to request the League of Nations to implement stricter sanctions within ten days, pending a response from Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. It is reported that Laval has requested Mussolini to specify the minimum acceptable armistice conditions, and it is also understood that Mr. Marion has also requested the Pope to urge Mr. Mussolini to accept a peaceful resolution. (Fifteenth National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) There is currently no confirmed information regarding the content of French Prime Minister Laval's talks with the British and Italian ambassadors yesterday. However, the French side acknowledges that Laval is currently adopting diplomatic reconciliation efforts, which are confidential. According to French newspapers, the assertion that Laval is awaiting Mussolini's minimum conditions cannot be confirmed. News of Laval's initiation of reconciliation has aroused satisfaction among people in Rome, but news regarding this matter from Italian official circles is still silent. It is widely believed that Italy will make every effort to support a solution that is compatible with its dignity. At the same time, Rome has received a report that Chief of the General Staff, General Badoglio, has arrived in Massawa. (Fifteenth Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Differing Opinions on Peaceful Resolution of the Dispute Between Britain and Italy. Britain Insists on the Original Plan, Which Italy Finds Difficult to Accept.</h3>
<p>(Rome) Regarding the peaceful resolution of the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, it is generally believed that it will be difficult for Britain and Italy to find a compromise solution, and that mutual acceptance is unlikely to be possible, at least at present. Italy still insists on administering the border areas of Abyssinia under a mandate system, while Britain insists that only a small part can be mandated, with Abyssinia gaining access to the sea as an exchange condition. Although Italy has not put forward any plan on this issue, and Italian diplomatic circles have repeatedly stated that the Italian government has no intention of putting forward such a plan, based on what is reported in Italian newspapers, the speeches made by Italy's chief representative to the League of Nations, Aloisi, and the broadcasts made to the American people, Italy's views are no more than the following: (1) Italy does not reject the peaceful resolution; (2) Abyssinian territory must be divided into two parts, one being the mainland territory of Abyssinia and the other being the provinces annexed in recent decades. Italy has already signed treaties with Abyssinia before the establishment of the League of Nations and should naturally enjoy special rights in these provinces; (3) If the Covenant of the League of Nations can be interpreted more appropriately, it can naturally be integrated with the current situation. Sugimura, the Japanese Ambassador to Italy, once drafted a plan advocating that the border provinces of Abyssinia should be administered by Italy under a mandate system, while the mainland territory should be administered by the League of Nations under a mandate system. Italy can accept this plan. Political figures here believe that although Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations only stipulates that the colonies of defeated countries, such as Germany and Austria, may adopt the mandate system, its scope of application may be expanded. It is also said that Abyssinia is, in practice, under the supervision of foreign advisers, and Abyssinia has also declared on its own initiative that it is prepared to accept any assistance from the League of Nations that can promote its political and economic level. Therefore, the mandate system that Italy can adopt for the border provinces of Abyssinia belongs to "Class B Mandate" (see Article 22, Paragraph 5 of the Covenant of the League of Nations). In other words, Italy is not allowed to freely establish an army in this mandated territory. If so, Britain's concerns about the establishment of indigenous troops near its colonies of Kenya and the Egyptian Sudan, or under foreign management, can be dispelled. As for the plan set by Britain, it was proposed by British Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs Eden when he visited Rome in May of this year, and has not changed so far, that is, to cede the Ogaden region of Abyssinia to Italy and allow Italy to enjoy economic privileges in Abyssinia, while giving Abyssinia a seaport in British Somaliland, which was rejected by Italy. The reasons are (1) the Ogaden region is a desert area; (2) the so-called economic privileges are unreliable, and what is the difference between this and the privileges granted to Italy by the 1928 Italian-Abyssinian Treaty; (3) if a sea passage is given to Abyssinia, it will naturally enable Abyssinia to expand its military equipment, and the threat to Italian territory in East Africa will also be expanded. Italy rejected this proposal before the East African war started, and now that it has occupied several sections of Abyssinian territory, it is even more difficult to accept. Moreover, Britain has previously declared that it will refuse to negotiate before the Italian army withdraws from Abyssinia, or at least before military operations cease. Italy says that the precondition for negotiations is to suspend sanctions. With such differences in opinion, how can there be any hope? (Fifteenth Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>British Chancellor of the Exchequer States: The Door to Negotiations is Not Closed. Prepare Early for Difficulties. Defence Programme Is Not For Aggression.</h3>
<p>(London) Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain said in a speech in Glasgow today that the British government had stated previously that if Italy did not resort to force in the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, Britain would be willing to help Italy fulfill its legitimate aspirations. Even today, after Italy has already started the war, Britain has never retracted this statement. "We do not want to close the door that was opened to Italy not long ago." Referring to the suggestion that the general election be postponed until next spring, the Chancellor asked the public, "Do we have the right to say that the crisis will be over by next spring? Do not deceive yourselves. We are not at the end of a crisis, but at the beginning of what may be a long era of hardship and fear. In this era, crises of the most serious nature may recur." The Chancellor then referred to Britain's defence programme, stating clearly that it was not intended for aggression. He said, "What we are undertaking is the absolute minimum necessary to achieve our objectives, and we do not want to go beyond this. Our efforts to obtain a general agreement on disarmament are not being relaxed." (Fourteenth Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Adjustment Committee Passes Financial Sanctions Plan. Representatives of Hungary and Austria Abstain.</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations General Assembly Sanctions Plan Adjustment Committee (hereinafter referred to as the Sanctions Committee) held a plenary meeting at 6 PM today. Representatives from all 53 member states of the League of Nations, excluding the parties involved, Italy and Abyssinia, attended. The meeting was very short. It unanimously passed the financial sanctions plan drafted by the Eighteen-Nation Committee. Before the vote on the plan, Hungarian representative Nickel declared that Hungary was a debtor nation and had nothing to do with financial sanctions, so it abstained from voting. Austrian representative Schüller also made the same statement. Representatives from Uruguay and Venezuela declared that they had to consult with their respective governments. Argentine representative Gracio declared that "Argentina will vote in favor of the financial sanctions plan, but it should be stated that there are one million Italian expatriates in Argentina, so some of the clauses in the plan are quite difficult for the Argentine government to implement. This should be considered by the Sanctions Committee." At this point, the Sanctions Committee passed the financial sanctions plan against Italy.</p>
<p>French Suggestions</p>
<p>The Sanctions Committee then passed a motion proposed by the French delegation. The motion suggested the following four items: (1) The Eighteen-Nation Subcommittee should immediately study the implementation plan for League of Nations member states to prohibit the export of various raw materials and finished products used for military purposes to Italy and stop the import of Italian goods. A special committee should be set up to study this plan. (2) The Eighteen-Nation Subcommittee should simultaneously study the implementation plan for economic mutual assistance among League of Nations member states in accordance with Section 3 of Article 16 of the Covenant. Another committee should be set up to study this plan. (3) The Eighteen-Nation Subcommittee should request the above two committees to carry out their work as soon as possible. (4) The above two committees should each draft specific plans and submit them to the Eighteen-Nation Committee for submission to the Sanctions Committee for approval and implementation.</p>
<p>Appointment of Two Committees</p>
<p>After the above motion was passed by the Sanctions Committee, two committees were appointed immediately: (1) the Economic Sanctions Committee, including fourteen countries such as Portugal, France, the Soviet Union, Poland, Spain, Canada, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, Argentina, Belgium, Turkey, Romania, and Mexico; (2) the Economic Mutual Assistance Committee, including nine countries such as Portugal, France, the Soviet Union, Poland, Spain, the Union of South Africa, Greece, Romania, and Yugoslavia. This is the result of today's plenary meeting of the Sanctions Committee. Since the establishment of the Sanctions Committee, it has completed the two major steps of embargoing arms and financial sanctions in just a few days, and is now starting to work on economic sanctions. The speed and agility of its work is unprecedented in the history of the League of Nations. Therefore, some political figures feel that if the Sanctions Committee continues to progress at this rate, the League of Nations may eventually become a tool of conflict. (Fourteenth Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Spanish representative Contos was elected today as chairman of the Economic Mutual Assistance Committee. This committee will seek to reduce the sacrifices made by some countries due to participating in economic sanctions against Italy. When explaining the purpose of this committee, Contos declared that some countries did not intend to obtain compensation from other countries, saying that we must all make sacrifices in order to restore peace. The sacrifices needed for peace are less than those needed for war. However, in order to comply with Article 16 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, we must have an agreement in order to reduce losses and inconveniences. The committee decided to compile statistics on Italy's foreign trade and submit them to tomorrow's meeting. (Fifteenth Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Full Text of the Sanctions Plan</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations General Assembly Sanctions Committee passed a plan tonight to implement financial sanctions against Italy in accordance with Article 16 of the Covenant. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>For the convenience of League of Nations member states in fulfilling their obligations under Article 16 of the Covenant, the following measures are hereby adopted:</p>
<p>(1) The governments of League of Nations member states shall immediately take various steps to ensure that the following transactions are completely prohibited: (A) Directly or indirectly providing loans to the Italian government and subscribing to bonds issued directly or indirectly by the Italian government domestically or abroad; (B) Directly or indirectly lending to the Italian government various bank loans and other loans of a nature, and fulfilling contracts to lend directly or indirectly to the Italian government in the form of advances or other means; (C) Directly or indirectly providing loans to public institutions, natural persons, and legal persons within the Italian territory, and subscribing to bonds issued by them domestically or abroad; (D) Directly or indirectly lending to natural persons and legal persons within the Italian territory bank loans and other loans of a nature, and fulfilling contracts to lend directly or indirectly to these natural persons and legal persons in the form of advances or other means; (E) Issuing shares on behalf of public institutions, natural persons, and legal persons within the Italian territory, or subscribing to shares or any kind of capital issued by them domestically or abroad.</p>
<p>(2) The governments of League of Nations member states agree to prohibit the various transactions mentioned in Items A to E above. All such transactions, whether conducted by nationals of their own country or by intermediaries from other countries, are prohibited.</p>
<p>(3) The League of Nations member states are requested to notify the Secretariat of the League of Nations as soon as possible of the measures taken in accordance with the above clauses. (Fourteenth Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>The Plan Is Quite Thorough</p>
<p>(Geneva) The progress in financial sanctions is due to the efforts of Greek representative Maximos, chairman of the Financial Subcommittee, and French technical expert Courant. Maximos handled the financial proposals at the meeting of the Eighteen-Nation Committee with competence and speed. He said that the resolutions were very thorough, and that any possible form of lending or financial business, whether directly or indirectly to the Italian government, was almost entirely included. (Fifteenth Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Can Be Implemented This Month</p>
<p>The Sanctions Committee will reconvene this afternoon. If the current progress can be maintained, everything can be decided before the end of this week. It is widely expected that financial sanctions can be implemented around October 31. (Fifteenth Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The British representative suggested that October 31 be the final date for the governments of League of Nations member states to approve the implementation of financial and economic sanctions against Italy. This proposal was passed by the Eighteen-Nation Committee today. Previously, South American representatives had stated that member states must approve the actions of their representatives in Geneva by their respective parliaments, and that the resolutions of the League of Nations Committee could not force countries to implement them. Therefore, Britain made this suggestion. (Fourteenth National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Soviet Representative Advocates Opening New Markets for Sanctioning Countries</h3>
<p>(Geneva) When the Soviet representative, Potemkin, discussed the issue of economic sanctions at the Sanctions Handling Committee, he strongly stated that sanctions must be carried out resolutely and effectively, and must be universal, otherwise they would be ineffective. Potemkin mentioned that some countries would not participate in sanctions, and some countries even refused to participate. He also expressed his willingness to ask the US government to prohibit the export of certain commodities (i.e., those specified in the form prescribed by President Roosevelt). As for dealing with countries that refuse to participate in sanctions, would it not be better to limit the necessary loans to these countries to the minimum and limit the import of goods used for military industries to these countries? As for the countries that suffer losses due to the implementation of economic sanctions, we should find ways to distribute these losses proportionally or open up new markets for these countries.

<h3>Japan Actively Approaches China, Adopts a Wait-and-See Attitude Towards the Italian-Abyssinian Dispute</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Italian Ambassador to Japan, Auriti, visited Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Shigemitsu at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 11:30 this morning to listen to the proceedings of the League of Nations, inquire about Japan's opinion on the League of Nations' economic sanctions against Italy, and hear about Lytton's activities in China and Japan's new policy towards China. The meeting lasted for 30 minutes before Auriti departed. (Fifteenth Den-tsu Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, when the Italian Ambassador met with Vice Minister Shigemitsu, he inquired about Japan's attitude towards the League of Nations' economic sanctions against Italy. Vice Minister Shigemitsu seemed to have stated the following: Japan is of course greatly concerned about the future development of the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. However, both Italy and Abyssinia have close friendly relations with Japan, and because the dispute is in Europe, Japan has no intention of taking sides. The wait-and-see attitude initially adopted has not changed to date. Recently, the League of Nations has implemented economic sanctions against Italy and has reportedly invited non-member states such as Japan, the United States, and Germany to participate. However, Japan has not heard anything about this. If the League of Nations has invited Japan to join, Japan does not need to express its attitude towards the issue of sanctions within the League of Nations' internal actions.

<h3>British Conservative Party Members of Parliament Petition Government Not to Impose Sanctions</h3>
<p>(London) Forty members of the Conservative Party in the House of Commons held a meeting the other day and unanimously resolved to request the government not to advocate for the implementation of sanctions against Italy at the League of Nations, and not to participate, for fear that the implementation of sanctions would lead to war. These members of parliament have recently appointed a delegation, led by former Colonial Secretary Amery, to meet with Prime Minister Baldwin to ask him to reassure the people that Britain will neither propose nor participate in sanctions that could lead to war.

<h3>Britain, Belgium, and the Netherlands Comply With League of Nations Resolution, Cancel Arms Embargo on Abyssinia</h3>
<p>(Geneva) British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Eden, recently notified the Secretariat of the League of Nations in writing that the British government, in accordance with the resolution of the League of Nations General Assembly Sanctions Committee, has recently revoked the order to embargo arms to Abyssinia. As for the arms embargo on Italy, it will continue to be maintained in accordance with the current methods. (Fourteenth Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the effectiveness of economic sanctions against Italy, it has recently been reported by responsible parties that the goods embargoed for export by the United States do not include kerosene and raw materials. If the Soviet Union also takes this step, the fuel needed for Italian aircraft, tanks, warships, and merchant ships will be impossible to prevent. According to news from Berlin, Germany does not seem to be participating in sanctions. However, officials believe that no matter what the attitude of other countries is, Britain will not change its current firm stance. (Fourteenth Havas)</p>
<p>Brussels The Belgian government has recently decided to comply with the recommendation unanimously passed by the League of Nations General Assembly Sanctions Committee on October 11 and allow the issuance of licenses for arms destined for Abyssinia, but has suspended the issuance of licenses for arms destined for Italy.

<h3>American Ambassador Explains America's Neutral Position to Britain</h3>
<p>(London) Reuters has learned that US Ambassador to London, Bingham, recently met with British Foreign Secretary Hoare and gave a responsible explanation of America's neutral position. In the first meeting, Bingham further clarified President Roosevelt's declaration of October 5 (i.e., declaring that any American who voluntarily engages in transactions with Italy or Abyssinia must do so at their own risk). In the second meeting, Hoare made some comments on Bingham's statement, but did not ask what attitude the United States would take if there were any decisions on sanctions against Italy in Geneva.

<h3>Hull's Important Speech Advocating International Joint Action to Restore Peace and Prosperity</h3>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull gave a radio address today advocating a triple international effort for peace and prosperity. Hull applied for international action to be implemented simultaneously: (1) Actively reforming international trade; (2) Gradually restoring monetary stability; (3) Securing international agreements that ensure affordable prices for all important raw materials needed everywhere. Hull said, "Every conflict leaves seeds for future conflicts. This is extremely obvious. Now, to overcome the causes of conflict, many countries must act simultaneously." The raw materials mentioned by Hull echo the recent remarks made by British Foreign Secretary Samuel Hoare on this issue, which proves that the United States is not opposed to participating in discussions. People regard Hull's words on monetary stability as particularly important, because US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, who is currently in Paris, told reporters yesterday that the United States is prepared to discuss monetary stability and exchange rates. Morgenthau visited the French Finance Minister yesterday and visited French Prime Minister Laval again today. (Fifteenth Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>US Shipbuilding Plan to Add Nineteen Warships of Various Sizes and Increase Naval Personnel to 200,000</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to a document released by the US Navy Department today, the United States plans to build one battleship, twelve destroyers, and six submarines in the fiscal year 1937. Naval personnel will be increased to 200,000. The United States also plans to add naval auxiliary ships, such as transport ships, tugboats, barges, and military supply ships, in the fiscal year 1936. (Fourteenth Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In an effort to strengthen national defence on the Pacific coast, the US Navy authorities plan to build a large-scale important military base on San Clemente Island, 50 nautical miles from the southern California bay. San Clemente Island is only a rocky islet, but if military facilities are added, its status will become more important. Its interests to the United States in the Pacific are like those of Malta to Britain in the Mediterranean. It is reported that shipyards, aircraft landing fields, and storage depots are already under construction on the island. (Fifteenth Hua Lian Telegram)</p>
<h3>Regarding the Naval Issue, Japan's Reply Content Opposes the British Proposal</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) On September 28, the British government sent a note to Japan proposing to convene a disarmament conference. The relevant Japanese ministries studied countermeasures and recently reached a consensus. After the cabinet meeting today, it was immediately telegraphed to Fujii, the acting ambassador to the United Kingdom. The gist of the telegram is as follows: "Japan's policy is to reduce the burden on the people based on the principle of non-aggression and non-threat. Although it is prepared to participate in military conferences convened in accordance with this policy, the British proposal this time is not consistent with Japan's policy. Mutual implementation of short-term warship construction plans, etc., may hinder a country's autonomous realization of military preparations, and a single agreement on qualitative disarmament alone will not achieve the real purpose of disarmament, so we strongly oppose the British government's proposal."

<h3>Using New-Style Deadly Weapons: Italian Forces Penetrate Deep into Southern Abyssinia; Poison Gas Bombs Cause Numerous Casualties; Northern Route Simultaneously Takes Offensive; Abyssinian Army Concentrates Preparations for War</h3>
<p>(London) A Daily Mail reporter stationed in the field received a telephone report from a European engineer in the Worka-Gouden province, stating that in the bloody battle in the Jerro-Goubi area, the Abyssinian army had suffered as many as 18,000 casualties. The Italian army is now using a new type of poison gas, causing Abyssinian soldiers and civilians alike to suffocate and flee northward in a frenzy. There was a major battle on Saturday in the Dalo area, where 4,000 Abyssinian soldiers and civilians died. The Italian side used 200 aircraft to cover General Graziani's troops as they advanced. Bombardment and poison gas bombs rained down on the Abyssinian lines. After the air attacks, they were followed by tanks. The Italian southern route has penetrated 31 miles into Abyssinian territory, and the front line has expanded from Walwal to Damot. However, the large Abyssinian army providing support from the rear has also concentrated approximately 200,000 men in the areas of Jijiga, Harar, and Tounsa, all under the strict orders of the Emperor to defend the border line of the plateau. This army is guided by foreign military advisors, such as Turkish General Vehip Pasha and German General von Riem, etc. Swiss engineers working in the Shebelle River basin reported that a large contingent of the Abyssinian army has crossed the Jubba River and is advancing rapidly, intending to attack Italian Somaliland in order to cut off the communication lines of General Graziani's forces. It is reported that General Taibono, the Italian northern route commander, personally flew hundreds of miles into Abyssinian territory last Wednesday. The Daily Mail reporter also stated that Abyssinia's Minister to France and chief representative to the League of Nations, Haile Wereide, has been appointed as the commander-in-chief of the Abyssinian army. It is said that Mr. Haile is about to depart from Geneva to return to his country and assume command of the front lines. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: According to a non-official telegram from Makale today, the Italian army has resumed its offensive on the northern front. The Italian army is advancing rapidly with tanks and armored vehicles on the plains between Houchane and Abaro (southeast of Adwa). The speed of their advance has startled the vanguard of General Seyoum's Abyssinian northern route command. General Seyoum is currently avoiding contact with the Italian army. It is anticipated that the Abyssinian army will defend in the mountains northwest and northeast of Makale. At the same time, a portion of the 250,000-strong army commanded by General Gassa has crossed the Tacazze River. If the Italian army advances towards Makale, this route of the Abyssinian army will threaten the Italian army's right flank. General Gassa is currently cooperating with General Seyoum. General Seyoum has been receiving a steady stream of reinforcements in recent days, but is currently unwilling to engage in a major decisive battle with the Italian army and is retreating in the direction of Makale. Today, 20,000 fresh troops arrived in Addis Ababa from Wa, Kaffa. The rear troops arriving in the capital are continuous, but there are not enough weapons to supply them. Therefore, the Emperor may order some of them to return to their hometowns. (Reuters Telegram, 15th)</p>
<h3>Italian Army on the Northern Route Consolidates Rear Positions; Adwa Border Highway Completed; Chief of Staff Arrives at Massawa Port</h3>
<p>(Rome) The Italian army's front line on the northern route, which connects the three cities of Adigrat, Adwa, and Aksum, has now been arranged to become a base for the Italian army's offensive. However, before Chief of Staff General Badoglio arrives at the front lines, an offensive will not be launched immediately. The highway connecting Adwa to the border has recently been completed. The first batch of transport trucks has already arrived in this city from the rear. Military experts attach great importance to this project, because there are two new-style highways from Italian Eritrea to the front lines: one to Adwa and one to Adigrat. (Havas Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>Rome: News has just been received here from Italian Eritrea confirming that Chief of Staff General Badoglio arrived at the port of Massawa yesterday afternoon. It is reported that the General departed from the port of Naples on the Conte Biancamano steamship on the 10th of this month to go to East Africa. He has now arrived at the port of Massawa in five days, so he must have transferred to an airplane en route, hence the speed. It is generally believed that General Badoglio's rapid trip to the front lines is a sign of a renewed offensive by the Italian army on the northern route. (Havas Telegram, 15th)</p>
<h3>Large Italian Army Enters Aksum City; Not Bombed Due to Being a Religious Holy Site; Italian Army on the Southern Route Halts Advance Temporarily Due to Rain</h3>
<p>(Rome) A special correspondent of the "Fascist Party Work Report" reported on the Italian army's occupation of Aksum, stating that this morning, the Archbishop of Aksum personally surrendered to General Taibono, the High Commissioner for East Africa, and presented the keys to the city gates. A large Italian army then marched into the city without resistance. The first to enter the city were the Askaris of the 23rd Regiment. Large numbers of reinforcements followed. Most of the residents in the city surrendered to the Italian army with their livestock. The Abyssinian army also surrendered en masse. (Havas Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>(Rome) This afternoon, it was announced here that the Archbishop of the holy city of Aksum had today presented the keys of the city to General Taibono, the commander-in-chief of the Italian army in East Africa. At the same time, according to news from Adwa, Aksum was taken without a fight. Italian outposts have reached the outskirts of the city. The Italian army did not bombard the city due to its religious nature. The Italians believe that with the fall of Aksum, the first act of the war in East Africa will be completed, and the second act will begin soon, and it will not encounter stubborn resistance, because Italian planes flew into the interior for reconnaissance and reported that no enemy troops were seen at all. At the same time, the Italian army advancing to Jerro-Goubi in the Worka-Gouden province has been stopped by heavy rain at Jerrohai and has temporarily halted its advance.

<h3>Abyssinian Ammunition Depot Bombed</h3>
<p>(Rome) According to news received here today, three Italian planes flew south from Makale near Adwa and bombed an Abyssinian ammunition depot. The Abyssinian army attempted to drive away the planes with rifle fire and shrapnel cannons. (Reuters Telegram, 15th)</p>
<h3>Abyssinian Chiefs Surrender to the Italian Army One After Another</h3>
<p>(Rome) Several chiefs of important regions in Abyssinia, such as Balambaras Kaggalasmaao, etc., have surrendered to the Italian army one after another. Their guards were all armed with rifles manufactured by British and Belgian companies. Furthermore, Egyptian Coptic priests from thirteen places such as Ribano, Surada, Anda, and Mariavie visited General Maravigna, the commander of the Italian army's right flank, and claimed that Grazmatch Guffsa, a descendant of the old Abyssinian royal family, surrendered to the Italian army due to an internal rebellion within his tribe.</p>
<p>(Rome) Semi-official sources announced that the military authorities in East Africa are planning to reorganize the subordinates of Grazmatch Guffsa, a surrendered Abyssinian general, into a formal native army. Also, 500 Abyssinian prisoners of war captured by the Italian army will be sent to the front lines to build roads. It is reported that these prisoners of war had been starving for five days when they were captured. It is also heard that the total area of land occupied by the Italian army in Abyssinia has reached 4,000 square kilometers. (Havas Telegram, 14th)</p>

<h3>Abyssinian Emperor Expresses Determination to Resist to the End; Minister of War to Personally Go to the Front Lines to Supervise the Battle; Generals Prepare for a Major Counter-Offensive</h3>
<p>Addis Ababa: According to a report from our special correspondent Ochsner, the Abyssinian government spokesperson did not deny the reports of the fall of Adwa and the surrender of the entire Tigray province to the Italian army, but reiterated repeatedly that the Emperor is determined not to succumb to force and will not cede an inch of territory. The Abyssinian government neither confirmed nor denied the report of Grazmatch Guffsa, a descendant of the Tigray royal family, surrendering to the Italian army. (Havas Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: According to our special correspondent's investigation, Minister of War Mulugeta will soon depart for Dessie in Wollo province, and may lead a strong force from there to the front lines in northern Abyssinia. Mulugeta is one of the most important figures in Abyssinia and is generally regarded as the Emperor's right-hand man. After he goes to the front lines, the Emperor will follow him, but the date of departure has not yet been determined. Once the departure for the front lines, the Abyssinian army will begin large-scale military operations.</p>
<p>Harar: Abyssinian chieftain Nasibu held a military conference here today, discussing plans for a major counter-offensive against the Italian army in the Worka-Gouden province with his subordinate generals. The generals all claimed that their spears and broadswords, coupled with their personal courage, would be enough to defeat the enemy. The Abyssinians here all believe that the Emperor has imprisoned the Italian ambassador and that the Abyssinian army has won every battle since the start of the war. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: According to responsible sources, several more native soldiers from Italian Eritrea have deserted from the Italian army and crossed the border into Abyssinia near Artisjabo to join General Tsahay. On the southern front, the terrain is very similar to a desert, flat and easy for large-scale troop movements, so the Italian army is advancing very quickly. It is reported that the Italian army is advancing towards the Shebelle River basin in the Worka-Gouden province and has occupied several positions in that province along the way without encountering serious resistance. However, the Abyssinian radio station in Jerro-Goubi, also in the Worka-Gouden province, is still operating as usual, indicating that the Italian army has not yet occupied the area and is only conducting aerial reconnaissance over the area. The Abyssinian government is still very tight-lipped about news from the front lines, so foreigners infer that the situation on the front lines must be very tense. However, according to general observations, although the Italian army is currently advancing, it has not yet made contact with large units of the Abyssinian army, so there have been no large-scale battles between the two sides so far.

<h3>Italian Ambassador Still in Addis Ababa; Confined to a Room, No Different From House Arrest; Abyssinian Ambassador to Italy Ordered to Return Home</h3>
<p>Addis Ababa: Foreigners here find the attitude of the Italian ambassador to Abyssinia, Vinci, quite strange. Vinci, along with the Italian army attaché Gagliardini and his loyal servant Ciaffani, has been confined to his residence for five days, refusing to see guests. The British and French ambassadors have attempted to visit him, but have been refused. It has been rumored that the Italian ambassador has departed three times, but each time has failed to materialize. The Italian ambassador originally intended to wait for the staff of the Italian consulate in Magalo to arrive here before departing together, but now that the Magalo consulate staff will arrive here soon, Vinci still has no intention of departing. He is voluntarily confining himself in a foreign country. Some say that he anticipates that the war will end soon and wants to remain in Abyssinia as a peace envoy, but his true intentions are unknown. A Havas reporter met today with the Greek servant who prepares meals for Vinci, who told the reporter, "These three men are confined to a room, and even I have not been able to see them. Each meal, I hand the food to the guard at the door, who passes it on to them. After an hour, I collect the dishes from the guard, and I have never been able to see them." (Havas Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: It is heard that Italian ambassador Count Vinci will depart from here on Wednesday for the town of Haddaama on the Addis Ababa to Djibouti railway, where he will meet with the Italian consular staff who have traveled there from Magalo, and together they will go to the coast.

Military bands and soldiers parade through the streets one after another, but the people have become accustomed to it and pay little attention. (Havas Telegram, 14th)</p>

<h3>Survey Group and Japanese Economic Circles Hold First Informal Meeting</h3>
<p>Discuss Finance, Trade, Industrial Raw Materials, etc. Wu Dingchang's Speech Shows Close Agreement on Both Sides' Opinions</p>
<p>Tokyo Communication: After the economic survey group arrived in Tokyo, they were invited by the Japan Economic Federation and the Japan-China Business Association to gather leaders from the banking and business sectors in Tokyo. At 10 a.m. on the 10th, at the Bank Club, the first informal meeting was held to exchange views. All members of the group attended. The Japanese attendees included: Fukai, President of the Bank of Japan; Kodama, President of Yokohama Specie Bank; Kato, President of the Bank of Korea; Akashi, President of Dai-Ichi Bank; Kikumoto, Chairman of Mitsui Bank; Yūki, President of Industrial Bank of Japan; Yasuda, President of Bank of Taiwan; Seta, Chairman of Mitsubishi Bank; Mori, Vice President of Yasuda Bank; Inoue, Chairman of Mitsui Bussan; Kushida, Director of Mitsubishi; Miyake, Chairman of 大仓; Kadono, Vice President; Otani, Vice President of Nippon Yusen; Gō Seinosuke, Chairman of Tokyo Electric Light; Fukao, President of Nisshin Kisen; and Ōfuchi, Director of Mantetsu's Tokyo branch, a total of twenty-seven people. The scope of discussion was roughly divided into four areas: finance, trade, industrial products, and raw materials. The opinions of both parties were very harmonious and continued until 2:30 p.m., and it was agreed to continue detailed discussions within days. At 3:00 p.m., a tea party was held at the Foreign Minister's official residence, hosted by Hirota and the two vice ministers and bureau chiefs. During the meeting, there was casual conversation. In the evening at 6:00 p.m., a welcoming dinner party was hosted by the aforementioned two business groups at the Industry Club. Leaders from the financial and business sectors attended, and Ambassador Jiang and counselors and secretaries from the embassy were invited to participate. At the beginning of the dinner, the host, 乡城之助, Chairman of the Economic Federation, delivered a speech, saying that "the relationship between China and Japan is close, and there should be possibilities for economic cooperation. Moreover, at this time, countries around the world are seeking economic cooperation. There is a particular need for economic cooperation between China and Japan. Unfortunately, the political relationship has not been satisfactory for many years, and I feel very sorry. This time, leaders of the economic circles on the front line of China have come to our country, which is a good opportunity. I hope that this opportunity can be used to achieve the goal of economic cooperation between the two countries," and so on. Later, Wu Dingchang, the head of the survey group, delivered a long speech (the original text is recorded later), which won warm applause from the entire venue. Both parties considered it satisfactory, and the atmosphere was unusually harmonious. After that, there was free conversation, and both parties unanimously advocated proceeding with the organization of a cooperation mechanism. Specific plans are being discussed. It wasn't until about 10 p.m. that everyone parted happily.</p>
<p>Wu Dingchang said in his speech, "We had intended to come to Japan several years ago to investigate the economy in preparation for cooperation. However, after the launch, it was not permitted by the political environment between the two countries, and it was delayed and failed to materialize. It is extremely regrettable. However, our aspirations have finally come to fruition today. It is so pleasant to be able to gather with influential people from both China and Japan, exchange opinions, and discuss economic cooperation between the two countries. Therefore, we firmly believe that the relationship between China and Japan is created by natural forces. Anyone who tries to cut off this relationship by artificial means is doing something useless and harmful to both sides. However, these useless and harmful events occur from time to time, which is enough to delay the progress of economic cooperation between the two countries. This is a clear fact. Therefore, while we are doing our best in economic cooperation between the two countries, we cannot but sincerely hope that the two countries will pay attention to improving the political environment in the future, so that we can carry out economic cooperation. In today's world, when the economic power of international cooperation is expanding, if countries A and B can sincerely seek economic cooperation, it will naturally be the mutual happiness of the people of both countries, not to mention more. Especially for China and Japan, one has already advanced to become an industrial country, and the other is still an agricultural country. There are few points of conflict in the products of the two countries. Moreover, for the few conflicting products, such as cotton cloth, silk, tea, and matches, there is still room for consultation to avoid competition, so as to make up for the deficiencies with the surpluses. In terms of economy, it is originally a mutually beneficial matter. In addition, due to geographical relations, there is no reason to abandon what is near and seek what is far if the goods needed between China and Japan can be supplied to each other. Therefore, China to Japan and Japan to China, from the standpoint of international economics, stand on an advantageous position that no other country can compete with. It is easy to seek cooperation in this position. However, in order to make economic cooperation between China and Japan a concrete fact, there must be concrete research and concrete plans. This great cause cannot be accomplished by a few empty words. This requires the efforts of comrades from both countries. Although we are weak, we dare not refuse the labor for the sake of the economic future of the two countries. There is an argument here that the success of China-Japan economic cooperation depends entirely on whether there is sincerity between the two countries. This statement is seemingly right but not. In general, nothing can be successful without sincerity, not to mention economic cooperation. However, how can anything be successful with sincerity but without a plan, not to mention economic cooperation? Empty talk about sincerity is too abstract. Therefore, we believe that the success of China-Japan economic cooperation depends primarily on whether there is an appropriate and feasible plan. If there is, then those without sincerity will inevitably generate sincerity, and those with sincerity can increase sincerity. We dare to assert that if the cooperation plan is good and mutually beneficial to the national economies of the two countries, no one in the two countries can give it皮对. Moreover, now that there are knowledgeable people in both countries who are sincere about economic cooperation between the two countries, how can the cooperation plan be achieved by the simple and abstract principle of advocating Japanese capital, using Japanese technology, and exchanging Chinese raw materials for Japanese industrial products? We must recognize that economic cooperation between the two countries is a century-old undertaking, and it is by no means for temporary gains. It is only possible to cooperate with some Japanese capital, hire a few Japanese technicians, and increase Sino-Japanese exports and imports by a few percentages in the short term, and cannot maintain its smooth progress permanently, so it is impossible to talk about economic cooperation between the two countries. China-Japan economic cooperation must establish a concept that promoting the general economic development of Japan is beneficial to China, and promoting the general economic development of China is beneficial to Japan. Each should cooperate and help each other for the sake of its own interests, and then can it conform to the true meaning of economic cooperation. We dare to assert that those in the Japanese economic circle with vision have long believed that the development of China's national economy is beneficial to the Japanese national economy without a doubt. Based on this concept, research on the issue of capital cooperation between the two countries, technical assistance, especially the entire trade issue between the two countries, will surely lead to the discovery of a good and concrete plan, sweeping away the previous suspicions and establishing a foundation for sincere cooperation. We must clearly acknowledge that the reason why the economic problems between China and Japan have not been able to get on the track of cooperation so far is entirely due to a misunderstanding that the economic interests of the two countries conflict. Based on this concept, each uses strategies, one side actively conducts, and the other side passively resists, resulting in mutual accusations of insincerity and difficult cooperation. If we want to truly do our best for the permanent peace of the two countries and put economic cooperation into practice, we must have a painful realization about the past. After the Manchurian Incident, in the past three years, China's international trade volume has decreased sharply. Compared with 1934 and 1931, the import and export volume has decreased by more than one-half. Japan has given up its position as the top place in China's international trade table, which it has continued to hold since 1910. Moreover, in these two years, imports have exceeded exports by about 2.1 billion yuan. China's export of gold and silver to make up for the trade deficit is about 700 million yuan. If China's national economy is not prosperous, what is its impact on international trade, especially on Sino-Japanese trade? It is as clear as looking at the palm of your hand, and there is no need to say more. Therefore, for Japan's sake, especially for China's sake, we cannot but work hard for the two countries to seek economic cooperation, so as to develop the economy of the Chinese people and further develop the economy of the Japanese people. We came here with this great mission, wanting to conduct factual investigations and listen to opinions from all parties. First, we present a general outline, and we ask for your opinions. As for various concrete methods, we cannot exhaust them at this moment with one word. We also plan to have more opportunities for both parties to conduct detailed research separately, negotiate to avoid conflicts, cooperate to carry out non-conflicts, find ways to alleviate suspicions, and implement them immediately without suspicions, and make continuous efforts to discover a good plan for the entire economic cooperation between the two countries. We believe that China-Japan economic cooperation is inevitable and possible, and it depends on our efforts.</p>
<h3>Wuchang Headquarters Closed - Remnant Bandits in Hubei Province Have Been Eliminated</h3>
<p>Hankou Communication: Chairman Chiang, because the Gan bandits fled west and the situation in Sichuan and Hunan was once tense, and for the convenience of command, specially moved the Nanchang Headquarters to Wuchang, with Zhang Xueliang as the director of the headquarters. It was formally established on March 1. At that time, Chairman Chiang had already come to Hankou from Gan. The senior personnel of the headquarters were all selected and appointed by Chiang. Later, Chairman Chiang went to Sichuan to supervise the suppression, which lasted for several months. Zhu De, Mao Zedong, Xu Xiangqian, and Zhang Guotao's bandits were all unable to gain a foothold in Sichuan and fled one after another, while He Long and Xiao Ke's remnant bandits were still scurrying in the border areas of Sichuan, Hunan, and Hubei. The center of gravity of bandit suppression was shifted to the Shaanxi-Gansu area in the north and to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River in the south. In order to meet the needs of the situation, Chairman Chiang specially established a headquarters in Xi'an, a headquarters in Sichuan, and an administrative office in Yichang, respectively, to supervise the suppression nearby. At this point, the Wuchang Headquarters was no longer necessary, so he ordered preparations to be made for its closure. Zhang Xueliang, the director of the headquarters, had already gone to Xi'an to take up his new post as deputy commander. The Wuchang Headquarters was in charge of Chief of Staff Qian Dajun, who is currently handling the closure. It is heard that the closure will be completed on the 20th, and the staff from various places will be transferred to work in the Xi'an Headquarters, Sichuan Headquarters, and Yichang Administrative Office.</p>
<p>In the sound of the closure of the headquarters, let's review the achievements of bandit suppression in Hubei Province. There are almost no large remnant bandits in the entire province. There are no traces of bandits in eastern, central, and northern Hubei. The He bandits in western Hubei retreat as soon as they commit a crime, and the southern Hubei area has also been cleared. According to Chen Jicheng, the commander of the bandit suppression in the border area of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi and the newly appointed garrison commander of Wuhan, the counties in southern Hubei, because they are adjacent to Hunan and Jiangxi, have been ravaged by remnant bandits for a long time in the past. Since the national army has worked hard to advance and suppress them, the large gangs have been wiped out. Now the bandit leader Xu Yegang has been beheaded, and the scattered bandits have dispersed. Therefore, the southern Hubei area is extremely calm. Only in Pingliu, Hunan, there are hundreds of bandits lurking in the mountains, but they are just struggling to survive. As for the recovered counties in southern Hubei, they have now emerged from the post-disaster period and are seeking to recuperate. The harvest in each county this year is good, and the vitality is expected to be restored. As for the border headquarters, it is still located in Puqi, and I plan to come and go to Puqi and Hankou to preside over it in the future. (14th)</p>

<p>Believe that the law is heavy, the administration is complicated, and it is burdensome to both superiors and subordinates. Call for revisions. The wording is very indignant.</p>
<p>Hankou Communication: Ship merchants from six provinces, including Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Henan, and Shaanxi, believe that the Hubei Water Police Department has promulgated ship registration regulations that are not connected with the central legal system and the administration of various provinces, resulting in a duplicate registration that harms the people, and the implementing personnel deliberately create difficulties, which is particularly inconvenient for merchants. Therefore, they have specially selected representatives to submit petitions to the headquarters, provincial party department, provincial government, the supervisory commissioner's office of Hunan and Hubei, and the provincial tax administration committee, urging them to make revisions. The wording is very sharp. The main points are divided into three points: (1) Police and navigation administration, duplicate registration. Ships are based on rivers, which cannot be limited to one province. The province's standalone laws should pay attention to the central laws and regulations system and avoid conflicts with the regulations of neighboring provinces. The police can only register ships operating in the local docks within their duties. For ships that have already been registered in neighboring provinces and other commercial ports, they can only implement inspection. It is impossible to confuse navigation administration as one. The central China route runs through ten provinces, including Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangsu, Sichuan, Jiangxi, Henan, and Shaanxi. If Hubei Province issues flags and licenses, it cannot prohibit other provinces from imitating them, with one ship flying so many flags and licenses. Although the procedures are cumbersome, they are chaotic and undisciplined, which will lose the national image to foreigners. This is the first point that should be revised in the regulations. (2) Registration fees, similar to taxes. Ship registration is the same in nature as the household registration handled by the land police. There is no reason to take additional expenses from the people. The regulations stipulate that old boats of 20 or more stones should be charged 3 jiao, and those less than 20 stones should be charged 5 fen. The fees are so different for the same license and the same procedure. What is this if not a new tax rule? The water police collect fees, and the financial department lists them as revenue. What is this if not collecting taxes in the name of the police? The price of each flag is 2 jiao, regardless of its value. The price of a license is different for the same item, regardless of its uniformity. Although it is not harsh to pay 7 jiao per boat per year, it is already close to miscellaneous. The end of gathering cannot be opened, and if it is opened, it cannot be cleaned up. Making money in an improper way, other provinces will follow suit, and the people's burden will be increased. In terms of business, there is a business tax, and in terms of books and documents, there is a stamp tax. There is a navigation tax, and the police also have a tax. At a time when the economy is depressed, the people's economy is bankrupt. What ability do they have to make unnecessary supplies? This is the second point that registration should be free. (3) Poor regulations, difficult registration. Boat households apply for registration, fill out forms, provide guarantees, pay fees, verify guarantees, inspect boats, and receive flags and licenses. The procedures are extremely troublesome, so it often takes more than ten days, and at least a week, to obtain them. Ship merchants operate and take advantage of opportunities. Recently, many people have missed opportunities due to difficult registration. There are also those who could not bear to lose the opportunity and drove out of the river secretly, and encountered a hurricane and capsized. Water police officers and staff originally have no tea fee regulations. In order to avoid difficulties, they have to pay each other tea fees. This is the third point that troubles should be eliminated. The Ministry of Communications' Ship Registration Law has no duplicate registration for the registration of seaports and commercial transport. The fees for registration and licensing of docks are also strictly limited. Under the central administrative rule, how can Hubei Province create its own atmosphere, break the established rules of the police, and open a precedent for harshness and miscellaneousness? The representatives are entrusted by ship merchants from six provinces and should submit a petition to your camp department. It is hoped that you will allow and order revisions to remove the cumbersome and harshness, so as to facilitate commercial transportation.</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Education Circles Dedicate Airplanes to the National Government</h3>
<p>More than 10,000 students from 74 schools attended. The National Government sent Chen Qingyun to receive the plane and give a speech.</p>
<p>Nanchang Communication: The Jiangxi circles, because of the severity of the national crisis and the urgency of foreign insults, specially formed the Aviation Salvation Committee, and separately donated funds to purchase aircraft for self-defense. The education circles decided to donate 1.5% of their salary for one year, and the students were free to raise funds, totaling more than 26,500 yuan, and entrusted the Aviation Committee to purchase two Breda training aircraft. After test flights in Nanjing and Shanghai, they flew to the province on the 7th and stopped at the old airport. The two aircraft were inscribed with "Jiangxi Education Aircraft (1) (2)" and "Donated by Jiangxi Education Circles." On the afternoon of the Double Tenth Festival, the education circles of the entire province held a dedication ceremony at the old airport. It is estimated that the Aviation Committee, Aviation School, Pacification Commissioner's Office, Provincial and Municipal Party Departments, Provincial and Municipal Governments, Chamber of Commerce, Trade Union, and leaders of various organs and groups, teachers and students from 74 schools, including 工专, 女中, 女职, 一中, and 鸿声, attended. They were all in uniforms, divided into vertical formations, facing the rostrum. The flags were bright, and the team was well-organized. After the music was played and the meeting was opened, Cheng Shixun, the Director of the Education Department, presided over the meeting. First, the chairman gave an opening speech, followed by Yan Jiping from the education circles reporting on the donation process. Then, Chen Qingyun, Director of the Aviation Committee, gave a speech on behalf of the National Government. The speech briefly stated that the modern era is a three-dimensional war, and the air force occupies a major position. Our country's air force is extremely young, and all sectors of the people must provide spiritual and material assistance to build the air force so that it can stand on its own in the dangerous international situation and not be exploited by others. In addition, Chairman Chiang's speech said, "The Jiangxi Education Aircraft is scheduled to hold a donation ceremony and naming ceremony, which shows the sincere patriotism of the Jiangxi education circles, which is commendable and gratifying. We should actively transport them and encourage the wish to be like tasting the bitter gall and lying on the new grass. We should be diligent and tireless and strive to contribute to the Ling Han's merits. There are high hopes for the many scholars." After the speech was over, Liu Heng (principal of 女中), Yan Jinfu from middle school, and Lai Caisheng from primary school, representatives of the teachers and students, carried the aircraft authorization certificate and respectfully presented the aircraft to the National Government. After Chen Qingyun, the representative of the National Government, accepted it, he bowed to each other. Then, the curtain on the head of the aircraft was unveiled, and Xiong Suixiu and Hu Zhaowen, female students from 一中, threw bottles at No. 1 and No. 2, respectively. The two aircraft took off in formation amidst the loud music and thunderous applause. At the same time, the five fighter jets of Longhai, Jiaoji, Zhengtai, and Pinghan also took off in formation to perform various stunts. The students threw their hats into the air and cheered, and six student representatives were selected to take a plane around the city for a week before dispersing at about 5 p.m. (October 10th)</p>
<h3>Large Export of Anhui Rice</h3>
<p>Over 900,000 Shi Exported from Wuhu, and Another Million Shi from Other Places</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Since the 15th year of the Republic, Anhui Province has been affected by the economic decline in the country. Although it has substantial agricultural resources, the production and sales are not well-regulated. The dumping of foreign goods and rice has not only hurt farmers due to low grain prices, but also stopped the millions of shi of rice that were previously shipped to Guangdong, Chaozhou, and other regions. As a result, rural areas are declining daily, and the overall economy and political construction of the province are also exhausted and difficult. Although there were widespread floods in the Yangtze and Huai Rivers this year, southern and central Anhui were minimally affected, and the agricultural harvest of rice was abundant. The export market is also showing signs of recovery. In recent months, the amount of rice directly shipped from Wuhu has reached over 900,000 shi. The amount shipped by sail from Wuwei, Hexian, Dangtu, and other counties also exceeds one million shi. In addition, the by-products and miscellaneous grains, such as rapeseed, rapeseed cake, honey dates, Xuan paper, eggs, cotton, tung oil, etc., shipped from the Jiangnan Railway and Yangtze River by steamer and sail to Tianjin-Pukou and Xun-Han, are also substantial. This is a rare phenomenon in recent years. Regarding rice prices, since the new grain has been harvested, they have gradually risen. From around six yuan, it has recently increased to seven yuan and six or seven jiao for superior rice, and seven yuan and two or three jiao for medium rice. Rice boats from Sanhe, Lujiang, and other places are flocking to Wuhu to sell their rice, with daily sales reaching over 10,000 bags. Iron boats are also constantly coming and going, which has brought prosperity to merchants and is quite promising. (14th)</p>

<h3>International Trade Bureau Announces Economic Situation in the First Half of the Year</h3>
<p>Frequent Disasters Affect Agricultural Losses Significantly; Tight Credit and Shrinking Credit Stifle Industry and Commerce</p>
<p>Shanghai Times Agency reports: According to the International Trade Bureau, the general economic situation in China in the first half of this year has not escaped the panic. Agricultural production suffered significant losses due to frequent disasters. Industry and commerce suffered from the continued decline in prices, and factories and shops were closed or bankrupt. As for finance, although there has been some return of silver, the tight credit situation remains the same as before. However, various measures taken by the government this year to save the financial panic and revitalize transportation and industry have been implemented one after another. The Shanghai Times Agency reporter interviewed He Bingxian, Director of the Bureau, yesterday, who provided the following information:</p>
<p>Frequent Natural Disasters and Reduced Production</p>
<p>Last year, China suffered particularly severe natural disasters, and agricultural products suffered losses. This year, continuing the disasters of the previous year, a spring famine occurred in the spring, followed by floods and typhoons. The floods caused by the Yellow River in North China and the Pearl River in South China were particularly serious. At the same time, floods also occurred in the Yangtze River. Under this widespread disaster situation, it is difficult to expect a bumper harvest of agricultural crops in the first half of the year. Wheat harvests were good in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, but poor in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan. However, as a whole, the wheat planting area in the first half of the year increased by about 7% compared to last year. As for rice, water and drought alternated. Although there are no estimates yet, its output will inevitably be affected by natural disasters. According to the first estimate of the China Cotton Industry Statistics Association, cotton production will be reduced compared with the previous year. In terms of tea, black tea production is better, while green tea is somewhat inferior. In terms of silk, Jiangsu Province produced about 300,000 dan of spring cocoons, and Zhejiang Province could produce 18,000 dan of silk.</p>
<p>Industry and Commerce Decline Further</p>
<p>In the first half of this year, Chinese industry and commerce deteriorated further. Prices continued to fall, with a trend of getting worse. Under this catastrophic price situation, industry and commerce were unable to maintain themselves. As a result, factories were closing one after another, and shops were declaring liquidation one after another. In terms of various industries, cotton yarn prices were not good, and the low price and slow sales of yarn were the most worrying. The reduction of working hours and the closure of yarn factories have become an unprecedented crisis. As for the silk industry, the first half of this year showed no improvement in the spring season, but gradually improved in the summer. Sales in Europe have shown significant development. The flour industry fluctuated, mainly due to the tightening of Chinese finance and the excessive import of foreign rice. Although the match industry has not seen any recovery, the organization of the Six Provinces Match Merchants Joint Business Office by the Great China Company and others to implement production and sales cooperation is not necessarily a good phenomenon. In addition, the Ministry of Industry established an alcohol factory in March, opening the first precedent for the National Government to directly run industries.</p>
<p>Economic Panic and Financial Construction</p>
<p>In terms of finance, this year continued the outflow of silver from last year's frenzy. Economic and financial panic led to various phenomena. From the surface, silver has gradually stabilized since the beginning of this year and has even returned to some extent, but in reality, the tight credit situation and shrinking credit are still extremely dangerous. As the financial situation became increasingly tight, there were repeated reports of silver shops declaring liquidation. However, there were several things in the Chinese financial community in the first half of this year that were worth noting, namely, the establishment of six new banks nationwide, the establishment of 63 new branch banks, the government's issuance of 100 million yuan of financial bonds, the postal savings bureau's implementation of rural lending, and the implementation of centralized collection and settlement of bills and notes by the silver industry. All of these are financial constructions in the midst of financial panic.</p>
<p>Overview of Fiscal Conditions in the First Half of the Year</p>
<p>The budget for the 24th year of the Republic of China had an expenditure and revenue of 957,154,006 yuan. The government reduced all unnecessary expenditures this year, while education, diplomacy, construction, and industry expenses were all increased. The issuance of public bonds this year included 100 million yuan of financial bonds, 100 million yuan of customs bonds, and 13 million yuan of local bonds issued by various provinces and cities. The most important fiscal measures in this period were the announcement of reduced export taxes, the formulation of income tax principles, and the proposed establishment of an inheritance tax law. The estimated revenue from customs, salt, stamp, and tobacco and alcohol taxes this year is lower than last year, while government and construction expenses are increasing daily, so it is necessary to open up new sources of revenue. In addition, the continued abolition of harsh and miscellaneous taxes and the implementation of fixed county budgets are also important aspects of this year's fiscal measures.</p>

<h3>The Flood Relief Association Holds a General Donation and Publishes a Letter to Compatriots, Asking All Sectors to Donate Generously</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: The Shanghai Municipal Joint Relief Association for Flood Disasters in Various Provinces stated that this year's flash floods in the Jiang, Huai, He, and Han Rivers have caused disasters one after another. The disaster victims are everywhere, and their misery is unprecedented in nearly a hundred years. Therefore, they are appealing to all parties for donations to save the people in distress. In order to achieve significant and macro effects and gather strength from everyone, the association has entrusted various banks, money shops, companies, and shops in Shanghai to raise general donations, divided into seven categories: one jiao, two jiao, four jiao, one yuan, two yuan, four yuan, and ten yuan, to be donated voluntarily by everyone. The association's letter to compatriots is found, recorded as follows: "1. Our country has suffered frequent disasters in recent years. This year, since the beginning of summer, continuous rain has caused flash floods in the Jiang, Huai, He, and Han Rivers, causing disasters in more than ten provinces, including Lu, E, Wan, and Gan. There are hundreds of thousands of disaster victims, more than in the 20th year of the Republic. The victims are emaciated and huddled on the roadside, and their misery is unprecedented. As autumn turns to winter, we look at those poor people who are displaced, hungry, and cold, waiting for rescue. Compassion is in everyone's heart. Putting ourselves in their place, how can we not be saddened? Shanghai is the richest area in the country, but in recent years, the market has been sluggish, and all industries are in decline. In addition, the decline of the rural economy in the interior has had an impact. The prosperity of the past is almost like the setting sun. However, even though society is poor, it should show the spirit of mutual rescue and self-rescue among Chinese people. Moreover, today's Shanghai society has inevitable luxuries and consumption. With a little frugality, there is still some extra capacity. We live in Shanghai in peace, with clothes and food. How can we not have compassion and care for our compatriots in various places who are groaning in hardship in the floods and after the floods, needing clothes, food, and medicine? This year's disaster area is vast, and there are many disaster victims. Without unified donations and mass contributions, it is impossible to overcome the difficulties.

<p>After the Municipal Public Security Bureau announced the extension of the voluntary registration period for smokers by one month, in order to ensure that smokers in the city understand the regulations and register within the deadline to avoid violations, the work is extremely tense.

<h3>The Entire Board of Directors of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Submits Resignation to the Ministry and Forwards it to the Executive Yuan, Due to the Inability to Realize Various Reorganization Plans</h3>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reports that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is a giant of China's self-operated shipping industry, founded in the eleventh year of the Tongzhi reign (1872). On November 8, 1932, the Ministries of Finance and Communications jointly submitted a proposal to the Executive Yuan, suggesting that the company be nationalized. This was approved by the Central Political Conference on the 9th of the same month. At the same time, Liu Hongsheng was appointed General Manager, and Ye Zhuotang and 15 others were appointed as Directors, and Chen Guangfu and nine others as Supervisors. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned yesterday that the entire board of directors, including Ye Zhuotang, Liu Hongsheng, Zhang Shouchu, Zhang Jia'ao, Du Yuesheng, Yang Zhixiong, Hu Bijiang, Li Ming, Qian Yongming, Yu Rizhang, Wang Xiao, Lai Zhang Xiaolin, Hu Junzhuang, Sheng 　Chen, Huang Jiangquan, and 15 others (note that Shi Liangcai has passed away and has not yet been replaced), in view of the fact that since the reorganization of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, although business has gradually picked up and income and expenditure can be balanced, and even generate a surplus, the old debts are too large, and the surplus is not enough to offset interest payments, resulting in the inability to realize various reorganization plans, have jointly submitted a request to the Ministry of Communications, forwarded to the Executive Yuan, to approve their resignation, in order to give way to more capable people. The submission has been sent out. It is heard that Zhu Jiahua, Minister of Communications, has tried to persuade them to stay, as the directors of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company are all famous figures and financial giants.</p>

<h3>Silk Factories Running Out of Raw Materials Due to Zhejiang Province's Monopoly on Cocoon Purchases. Guilds and Labor Unions are Appealing for Relief</h3>
<p>This year, due to Zhejiang Province's monopoly on cocoon purchases, Shanghai silk factories are experiencing a severe shortage of raw materials and extreme panic. The silk reeling labor union has decided to appeal to the central government for relief. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Unqualified Registration</p>
<p>Since Zhejiang Province's Department of Construction monopolized spring cocoon purchases this year, silk factories in Shanghai have been affected. Therefore, the number of silk factories that have started operations this year has sharply decreased compared to previous years. When the Zhejiang Department of Construction's Silkworm and Silk Monopoly Committee handled autumn cocoons, it divided the entire province into ten cocoon zones, stipulating that they could be openly purchased, but a separate regulation for registering cocoon businesses was established, with harsh content (for example, eight cocoon stoves could be registered, but they must be wood-fired stoves, etc.). Therefore, of those Shanghai silk factories that went to purchase, only seven businesses were registered, and the rest were unqualified.</p>
<p>Raw Materials Cut Off</p>
<p>This year, Zhejiang produced over 20,000 dan of dried cocoons, most of which were purchased by Wuxi Yongtai (as Yongtai had signed a contract with the Department of Construction at a high price to monopolize sales). The rest was preferentially purchased by Zhejiang silk factories. In total, Shanghai silk factories purchased less than 3,000 dan of Zhejiang cocoons. At the same time, Zhejiang Province produced more cocoons than Jiangsu Province. After Shanghai silk factories were deemed unqualified for registration in Zhejiang Province, Jiangsu Province's businesses were also monopolized by factories from other places, resulting in a cutoff of raw materials.</p>
<p>Request for Relief</p>
<p>Due to the shortage of raw materials, the Hubu Huyuanji, Houji, Yongji, and Xieyuan factories in Zhabei have announced shutdowns. Currently, there are still 20 factories in Zhabei, 9 in Hongkou, 2 in the concession, and 2 in Nanshi Longhua, for a total of 31 factories. On average, they need 400 dan of dried cocoons per day for reeling, but the 3,000 dan of Zhejiang cocoons can only last for one week. Therefore, silk factories will all shut down this year. The silk factory guild has decided to hold a meeting in the next few days to discuss how to deal with the Zhejiang Province monopoly. The four district six division two silk reeling labor union believes that 20,000 workers are about to lose their jobs, so it has decided to jointly appeal to the central government for relief.</p>
<h3>Factories Must Register Promptly: Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Issues Notice</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday issued a notice to its members in various industries, stating that on the 14th of this month, it received Instruction No. 8168 from the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, which cited Instruction No. 1543 from the Municipal Government, which cited Consultation No. 13214 from the Ministry of Industry, which stated that the Ministry had previously amended and promulgated the Regulations for Factory Registration, which had no compulsory registration provision, in May of this year, and requested compliance. However, nearly three months have passed, and the number of factories applying for registration is still very small, and the overall situation of domestic industry is still unclear, making it impossible to carry out any industrial administration. Therefore, another consultation is being made to urge prompt registration. If there is further delay, strict enforcement will be carried out in accordance with Article 12 of the Regulations for Factory Registration, in order to emphasize the importance of official orders. In response to this, it was noted that the amended Regulations for Factory Registration had been previously forwarded, and now the previous consultation is being forwarded again, ordering the bureau to comply and promptly forward it to unregistered factories to comply as well, applying for registration with the bureau before the end of this month, and paying the certificate fee of one yuan and stamp tax of two jiao in accordance with the regulations for registration, and not to wait and see and make a mistake. Having received this, it is noted that the chamber has already been ordered to issue a notice and urge compliance with the law, and now the previous consultation is being forwarded again, and the chamber is instructed to forward it to the factories under its jurisdiction for prompt registration, without further delay.</p>
<p>Notice from the Bureau of Social Affairs</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, in order to handle the registration of various factories, collects certificate fees in accordance with regulations, and registration applicants must pay in person at the bureau. It has not sent personnel to collect fees from various factories. The bureau is deeply concerned that someone may be posing as its staff, and specially notified all factories yesterday to be vigilant, stating that in this factory registration, in addition to posting notices in newspapers and separately ordering and instructing the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and various factory groups to comply, the bureau has not separately sent letters or personnel to urge compliance. The certificate fee and stamp tax totaling one yuan and two jiao collected in accordance with regulations should be paid by the registration bureau to the bureau to obtain a formal receipt, and the bureau has not sent personnel to collect fees from various factories. If anyone is falsely using the bureau's name to swindle and cheat, they should be immediately handed over to the nearest public security agency for investigation, and the bureau should be notified as well. This notice.</p>

<p>Petition</p>
<p>Respectfully presented, the vegetable vendors have been banned by the French police from setting up stalls on Kangti Road for more than a month. They previously petitioned your association to uphold justice and provide assistance, and 51 shops on Kangti Road also jointly wrote to your association requesting negotiations. However, many days have passed since then, and we have not heard any expression from your association, and the requests of the shops have not been replied to. The vegetable vendors have lost their livelihoods and have been running around and appealing all day long, but have not been able to resume business. More than a dozen vendors have been found to be starving. If they cannot resume business, it is feared that the entire group will starve, which will have a significant impact on society. Therefore, we are submitting a continuation of the petition, requesting that your association investigate the previous petition and allow negotiations to be carried out.</p>
<h3>Hu Wenhu Talks About the Need to Establish a Liaison Organization for Overseas Chinese to Promote Industrial and Commercial Development... Guiding Overseas Chinese in Allied Countries</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Hu Wenhu, a leader of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, led a team of overseas Chinese from Malaya back to China to participate in the National Games, which was warmly welcomed by all sectors of society. After arriving in Shanghai, Hu was very busy with social engagements, but he took the time to go to the sports field every day to watch the competition, which shows that he pays great attention to sports. The reporter met him on the platform yesterday and took the opportunity to talk with him and ask for his impressions of this visit. Hu was sincere and made very meaningful remarks to the reporter. According to Hu, he led the team back to China to participate in the National Games, and he was warmly welcomed by all sectors of society, which is very touching. From this, it can be seen that the Chinese government and compatriots care for overseas Chinese in every possible way. However, in the past, overseas Chinese were far away from their motherland, and were very isolated from the situation in their motherland. There have been times when overseas Chinese who returned to China were oppressed and bullied by local bullies, corrupt officials, and corrupt bureaucrats, which almost made overseas Chinese regard returning to China as a dangerous path. Even those who wanted to return to China to invest and start businesses were afraid to try easily due to various obstacles. Domestic compatriots have the same feeling towards overseas Chinese. Therefore, if we want to communicate the voices of China and Southeast Asia and connect the feelings of overseas Chinese, we must further have a liaison agency or organization. It is Hu's opinion that if we can unite enthusiastic people from the industrial and commercial circles at home and abroad to organize a kind of liaison agency, respond to each other, assist each other, promote the prosperity of industry and commerce, guide overseas Chinese who return to China, and effectively guarantee them, he is very willing to do his best and work together if such an organization can be realized.</p>

<h3>Lawyers Association of the Republic of China Announces the Seventh Session, to Be Held in Shanghai on February 16, 1936</h3>
<p>The Lawyers Association of the Republic of China sent a letter to the lawyers associations of all provinces, stating that the seventh session of the association's general meeting was originally scheduled to be held in Shanghai on September 23 of this year, but it has been postponed due to unforeseen circumstances, as notified by the Shanghai Lawyers Association.

<h3>Ge Gongzhen Returns to China: Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday from Vladivostok</h3>
<p>Ge Gongzhen, previously entrusted by the Central Propaganda Department, accompanied the League of Nations Northeast Investigation Team to Geneva to participate in the League of Nations Special Assembly. After the event, he was entrusted by the Shanghai Daily Newspaper Association to attend the International Press Experts Conference held in the capital of Spain. Simultaneously, he took the opportunity to visit France, Italy, Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, and various states to investigate communication enterprises and major news agencies, and to discuss methods of exchanging news. He spent a relatively long time in the Soviet Union, traveling over 80,000 li to visit major industrial and agricultural areas. After being abroad for more than three years, he arrived in Shanghai yesterday aboard the Russian ship "Northern" from Vladivostok. Ge spoke about the recent situation in Europe, believing that the trend of military competition among various countries means that war is inevitable. He predicts that the extent of the region and the weight of sacrifice will certainly be even more severe than the previous World War. At that time, China's being drawn into the vortex will be unavoidable, and the difficulty of the situation will be a hundred times worse than it is today. However, we must not be blinded by objective factors and become overly complacent. Consider the Soviet Union, which also experienced civil war and international interference, and was covered in scars. Following this, there was famine, but since burying its head in construction, the national strength has risen day by day. The difficulty lies in not relying on foreign capital, but only on labor. Our country has a vast territory, abundant resources, and a population the same size as the Soviet Union. The backwardness of industry and agriculture, the decline of agriculture, and the lack of universal education are also similar. Therefore, the Soviet Union's process of establishing heavy industry, military industry, and state farms has much to offer us for reflection. Moreover, our country has a naturally mild climate, fertile land, abundant and cheap labor, and is far superior to the Soviet Union. It only needs leadership, unified will, trust in science, and attention to organization. The Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan, which was successful in four and a half years, could perhaps be shortened in our country. Difficult times build a nation, but only if we are self-confident, that is, confident that the Chinese nation absolutely has the ability to save China, and so on.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Replies to Ratepayers' Meeting: Accepts Austerity Suggestions, Cancels Fixed Transportation Allowances for Staff Starting This Month</h3>
<p>Xu Xiaochu, Jin Zongcheng, Zheng Chengqing, Ma Shaoquan, Jin Runxiang, Sun Mingqi, Chen Ziming, Xu Guanqun, Ye Jiaxing, Shen Tianxin, and other committee members of the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession, previously wrote to the Ratepayers' Association to forward a letter to the Municipal Council, suggesting that it economize on expenditures to lighten the burden on taxpayers, due to the economic downturn and decline of industry and commerce, and because the rent reduction movement was an inevitable trend. After receiving this suggestion, the Municipal Council immediately canceled the monthly fixed transportation allowances for all staff members starting this month, and replied to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, saying: "Your letter of October 7, forwarding the opinions of the executive committee members of your association and your association regarding the economic decline of this port and the need for the bureau to economize on financial expenditures, should be given urgent consideration. This reply is for your information."</p>

<h3>Japanese Newspaper Reports: China's Cement Industry Self-Sufficient</h3>
<p>The Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun reports that China's cement industry has recently been able to supply the needs of the country. Previously, it relied solely on imports from foreign countries, but now it has surpassed them. The important cement companies in China are the Qixin Cement Company in Tangshan, the Shanghai Cement Company in Longhua, and the China Cement Company in Longtan. The total output of these companies in 1934 was approximately 2.4 million yuan. The output of Shanghai Cement Company and China Cement Company is similar, and Qixin Company produces slightly more. There is also considerable production in Hubei, Guangdong, Shanghai, and Jiangsu. Currently, the Chinese government and Chinese industrialists are planning to establish a large-scale cement plant in Nanjing, located in Qixia Mountain, named the Jiangnan Cement Company, with a capital of 2.4 million yuan. The Sanquan Cement Company in Guangdong has been producing 1,200 barrels per day since it started production last year, and recently added new-style machinery worth 2.5 million yuan, which can be called the only cement factory in China. According to a survey by foreign experts, the total cement consumption in China is approximately 5.2 million barrels per year, and still requires 7 million barrels. If the production capacity can be fully utilized, it will not only be self-sufficient, but also have a surplus for export.</p>
<h3>Japanese National Smuggles Silver, Refuses Inspection by Customs Officers, Later Discovered by Japanese Police</h3>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News reports that on Sunday, a certain Japanese national residing at No. 180 Kunshan Road was carrying luggage to the Huishan Wharf to board a Japanese ship to return to his country. Customs anti-smuggling officers suspected that he was carrying silver in his luggage and wanted to inspect it, but the Japanese national refused, nearly causing a riot. Later, a police officer from the Japanese Consulate intervened and escorted the Japanese national and his luggage to the Japanese Consulate, where an amount of smuggled silver was found. Today, a spokesperson for the Japanese Consulate stated that they will take appropriate action to punish this person, and also said that the Japanese authorities have been doing their best to assist the Chinese authorities in implementing the ban on silver smuggling, and will continue to do so in the future. However, they will not allow customs officials to arrest or search Japanese nationals.</p>
<h3>Robbers Shoot and Kill Indian Woman, Open Fire and Resist Arrest, Bullets Fly Everywhere, Three Passersby Wounded by Bullets, One Robber Shot Dead by Chinese Police, Flesh and Blood a Blur</h3>
<p>No. 1032 Foch Road in the French Concession is rented by an Indian named Lubauk Singh (transliteration). Lubauk is 37 years old this year, and his wife, Boshen Tieke (transliteration), is 38 years old this year. The couple has been in Shanghai for a long time, doing nothing and living off of lending money at high interest rates, with a generous income, leading robbers to mistakenly believe that there was a large sum of gold hidden in their home, and thus they conceived a desire to possess it. At 7:15 yesterday morning, not long after Lubauk and his wife got up, five robbers wearing short clothes and speaking with a Northern accent resembling people from Jiangbei rushed in, showing two pistols and threatening them not to make a sound. As they were about to search and rob, Lubauk's wife, Boshen Tieke, disregarding the danger, stepped forward to stop them, infuriating the robbers, who immediately fired a shot at her, hitting a vital point, and she immediately fell to the ground, dying instantly. Seeing that they had caused trouble, the robbers did not have time to search and rob, and immediately turned around and fled. Seeing his wife shot, Lubauk was unwilling to let it go, so he closely followed the robbers, chasing and shouting "robbers" along the way. The robbers fled towards Maichqi Road. Lubauk chased to the intersection and reported to Chinese Constable No. 1701, who was stationed there, who assisted in the pursuit, blowing the police whistle. Seeing constables chasing closely behind, the robbers opened fire along the way to resist arrest, bullets flying everywhere, injuring passersby Ni Caigen (25 years old, from Ningbo), who lived at No. 1 Baoanpo, Maichqi Road, and was a tailor (bullet wound to the right foot), Cai Jinkui (23 years old, from Pudong), who lived at No. 8 Julais Road, and was a mason (bullet graze to the chest), and an elderly woman about 50 years old (surname unknown, living at Liu's Residence), who was wounded in the head by a bullet, and other two people fell to the ground. At that time, the Chinese constable in charge of the second district of the Foch Road police station heard the sound of gunfire and shouts of "robbers" and rushed to intercept and arrest them, firing back at the entrance of No. 209 Maichqi Road. A bullet hit the head of a robber holding a gun, penetrating his forehead and causing him to fall to the ground with his brain spilling out, dying instantly. His face was covered in blood and gore. The robber was about 40 years old, wearing a black padded jacket, blue cloth trousers, a monk's haircut, black cloth shoes, and grey socks, with a pistol still in his hand. The remaining robbers fled without a trace in an instant. The Foch Road police station immediately summoned an ambulance to rush to the scene and send the three injured passersby to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Meanwhile, detectives rushed to investigate, and brought back to the police station the pistol in the dead robber's hand, and the robber's body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan branch autopsy center. The body of the victim, Boshen Tieke, was taken by car to the Feilun Road autopsy center to await inspection by the relevant British Consulate official. At noon, the French police station reported to Prosecutor Wang Zai of the Special No. 2 Court, who, accompanied by forensic clerk Di, confirmed the robber's death and ordered Tongren Fuyuan Hall to take photos and bury him. After the three injured were admitted to the hospital, Ni and Cai's injuries were relatively minor, and they were bandaged by the doctor and discharged home. The old woman's injuries were more serious and she was kept in the hospital for treatment. After the incident, special agents from the French police station rushed to surround and search the scene of the incident, detaining a suspected rickshaw driver from Jiangbei, who was taken to the police station. It was found that he had previously committed a robbery case and had a record. He is currently under investigation. Meanwhile, the Western Inspector General ordered all detectives on duty to strictly apprehend the robbers who were at large and bring them to justice for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Passenger Commits Suicide by Jumping into the Sea on the New Jiangtian Steamer from Ningbo to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Investigation Reveals He Was an Employee of the Shunji Machinery Factory in Ningbo, and Took This Desperate Measure Due to Unrepayable Debt</p>
<p>The New Jiangtian steamer of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which runs the Shanghai-Ningbo line, sailed from Ningbo to Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 14th). Before casting off the mooring ropes, a passenger, about 50 years old, boarded cabin number 66 of the ship. The tea attendant, Shao Bingyan, provided attentive service. The passenger identified himself as Zhang, had no luggage, and seemed quite relaxed. After the ship cast off the mooring ropes, he ordered the tea attendant to buy wine and drank wildly, behaving quite lavishly. At 9:00 PM, the Zhang-named guest walked out of his room and gazed at the scenery by the ship's railing before returning to his room to rest. He went out again at around 10:00 PM, and had not returned by noon. The tea attendant grew suspicious and notified other colleagues on the ship to inquire separately, and also sent people to look for him in the toilets, but there was no trace of him. Realizing that something untoward had happened, they re-examined the items in the room and found a long gown, a cigarette case containing 15 cigarettes, a one-yuan Zhejiang Local Bank banknote, a business card of Wu Yunjin, and two small knives. Also, a letter was found in the long gown, using an envelope from Shunji Machinery Factory. The envelope was addressed to "Mr. Zhang Xiang of Shunji Factory, Tujiang Lane, Jiangbei Bank of Ningbo". The original letter read: "Brother Shiheng, please read. I owe a large amount of money to the factory, which I cannot repay. The amount owed is about 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. I have no choice but to take this desperate measure," and so on. It was then learned that the passenger had committed suicide by jumping into the sea. The tea attendant reported the situation to the purser and submitted the letter and other items so that family members could come to identify the body.</p>
<h3>Dispute over Property Inheritance After Wang Yaochen's Death: Lu Xingyuan Accused of Forgery</h3>
<p>Wang Yaochen Owned Much Property in Both Xiamen and Shanghai; His Will Left the Property to His Concubine, but His Legal Wife Believed It Was Not Her Husband's Handwriting</p>
<p>Lu Xingyuan, a Cantonese who formerly served as the President of the Shanghai Provisional Court and the Court of Appeal, became a lawyer in Shanghai after retiring. He is now accused of forging a will on behalf of Wang Yaochen, a French national from Xiamen, Fujian, who entrusted him to draft the will during his lifetime, giving it to Wang's concubine, Du Ruizhen, for safekeeping. Wang's wife, Ouyang Shunying, believes it to be forged and has hired a lawyer to file a criminal complaint for forgery in the First Special District District Court. In addition to Lu Xingyuan, the defendants also include Du Ruizhen (also known as Wang Du or Wang Ruizhen) and Shi Zhinan (also known as Shi Yuankai), the executor of the will. Wang Yaochen, also known as Wang Youyu, was originally from Xiamen but became a French national.</p>
<p>Ouyang Shunying married Wang at the age of eighteen and gave birth to a son named Shengduan. However, several years ago, he suffered from a mental illness, and treatment was ineffective. Therefore, although he is now grown up, he is like a disabled person, living with his mother in their hometown of Juanxia Shizai in Xiamen, in a house they built themselves. Du Ruizhen is Wang's concubine and resides at No. 17 Yugu Village, Yuyuan Road, in this city. Wang would travel between Xiamen and Shanghai. Two years ago, he came to Shanghai from Xiamen and never returned to his hometown. He died of illness in his Shanghai residence on October 18 of last year, at the age of fifty. When his wife in her hometown heard the news, she was filled with grief and, while still in mourning, published a notice in the Shenbao and Xinbao newspapers stating that all of Wang Yaochen's real estate in Shanghai and Xiamen would be inherited by her and her son. Anyone with objections was asked to present evidence within two weeks. At the end of the advertising period, there was no response at first. It was not until January 24 of this year that Huang Yizhu, a wealthy merchant from Xiamen, and Huang Yuqi, the owner of Changxing Firm in Shanghai, sent a letter to Ouyang Shunying informing her that Wang Yaochen had borrowed 6,000 yuan from them and requested recognition of their debt. On March 17, Du Ruizhen suddenly instructed Wang Shengqiang, Wang Yaochen's nephew, to send a letter to the French Consulate in Xiamen, stating that Wang Yaochen had made a will three days before his death, leaving all his property to Du, and requesting that the will be registered. When Ouyang Shunying heard about this, she examined the will and believed that the signature on it was definitely not her husband's handwriting, and that the application for registration was also beyond the deadline advertised in the newspaper. Therefore, she strongly denied the validity of the will. The French Consulate in Xiamen, because there was a dispute, did not approve the registration. Later, Ouyang found out that the will had been drafted by Lu Xingyuan, the original lawyer, and that it stated that Shi Yuankai, the executor of the will, had the power to manage, dispose of, sell, mortgage, and redeem the property, which she found even more outrageous. She immediately initiated legal proceedings in Xiamen. Unexpectedly, Du Ruizhen, seeing that the French Consul had refused to register, quickly changed her plans and secretly transferred 5 mu, 8 fen, 1 li, and 8 hao of land located on Petain Road, under the name of Wang Yaochen's father, Wang Wende (alias Zhong), who had passed away decades ago. First, it was mortgaged to a foreigner, and then, on May 23, it was entrusted to the trust department of the Bank of China for sale, obtaining a price of 91,000 yuan. She also planned to sell the Shanghai property and then take over the Xiamen property. Ouyang was determined to fight to keep the inheritance, so she hired lawyers Liu Shifang and others to file a criminal lawsuit against Du Ruizhen and Lu Xingyuan, accusing the defendants of colluding to forge the will, impersonating the name of Wang Wende, who had been dead for a long time, stealing the inheritance, and inciting Huang Yuqi of Changxing Firm to pursue the loan, causing the plaintiff to be overwhelmed. Therefore, the first defendant, Du Ruizhen, is guilty of violating Articles 210, 216, 217, and 320, paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. The second defendant, Lu Xingyuan, is guilty of violating Articles 210, 217, and 215 of the Criminal Law. The third defendant, Shi Zhinan, is guilty of violating Article 30 of the Criminal Law. She requests that they be punished according to the law and that the stolen land be returned. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiao Fen opened the court to hear the case. The defendant Lu Xingyuan appeared in court, but the other two defendants did not appear because they could not be summoned. First, the plaintiff, Ouyang Shunying, stated that she is 51 years old and married Wang Yaochen 34 years ago, and gave birth to only one son, Shengduan. She then stated the facts of the lawsuit. Because she spoke in the Min dialect and her voice was as fine as a fly's, it was difficult to hear. What she said was roughly the same as the above. The defendant Lu Xingyuan then stood in the witness box and answered the charges. He said that the plaintiff was not present when Wang Yaochen entrusted him to write the will, so how could she know that it was forged? The will was written on October 15 of last year, when Wang called me to his residence and wrote it on three sheets of paper. Wang was already ill, and after I read it to him, he signed it himself. He also presented the original will to the court and stated that the details of the matter had been described in detail in his reply. The court ruled that the case still needed investigation and rescheduled the hearing for the afternoon of October 22.</p>
<h3>International Trade Bureau Introduces Domestically Produced Products</h3>
<p>According to the International Trade Bureau yesterday, the Bureau has recently received several letters from foreign merchants requesting introductions to domestically produced products. They are now published below. It is hoped that domestic manufacturers and export companies will write to the Bureau's Guidance Department for introductions: (1) Kong Kee Company of the Netherlands seeks factories and export firms manufacturing jade carvings, real and fake jade, asbestos, mica, pig bristles, hog bristles, and paintbrushes for direct transactions. (2) A certain company in this port needs a large quantity of pig bristles. (3) Jimmy Company of the Netherlands needs gambier and various chemicals for soap making, leather making, paper making, color making, and textile use. Please introduce manufacturers and export firms. (4) Mr. Szostakowski of Poland requests that Chinese cinnabar dye manufacturers disclose prices and delivery terms.</p>
<h3>Young Woman Pleads for Separate Residence, Moving and Affectionate Words</h3>
<p>Since the situation is worse than sleeping in the same bed with different dreams, the hope of being like a pair of mandarin ducks that grow together on the same branch has been dashed.</p>
<p>Shao Xu, a young woman from Zhenhai, recently hired Peng Qixiu and Xu Wufang, two lawyers, to file a petition in the mediation court of the district court, requesting to live separately from her husband, Shao Renfen (brother of Shao, the owner of the Tianyi Film Company in this city), and to return 30,000 yuan for clothing expenses and 50,000 yuan for living expenses, a total of 80,000 yuan. Her petition is written in parallel prose with rhyming couplets, with moving and affectionate words, stating roughly that she has been abused and abandoned, and that the situation is truly unbearable. From the beginning of her marriage to the defendant, their relationship was harmonious and their bond was strong. Later, because her younger sister was getting married in Ningbo, she used this as an excuse to return to Ningbo for about two weeks. When her mother accompanied her back in the spring, she initially thought that like the eyebrow pencil, which is used to draw beautiful eyebrows, they would be briefly separated before being reunited. Like the poem about the alarm pillow, she would wait to compose it late at night. They would pour out their feelings of separation to each other and talk about their mutual longing. They would surely be tender and affectionate, admiring Liang Hong and Meng Guang under the eaves, and tuning the zither and se in the room. Who would have thought that the defendant would imitate Liu Xiahui by closing the door and acting out an evil drama in the mud? Regardless of the raging wind and rain, he only opened his mouth to speak harsh words. Even if she called and pleaded ten thousand times, she only received anger in response. Neighbors did not understand, but fortunately she had the protection of her crown. Her lips and tongue were exhausted before they finally got along. From then on, the young woman felt as if she were a recluse in a retreat, a bowl of cold porridge was like food that had been begged for, and five nights in a cold quilt made her feel like she had a tragic fate. She forced a smile through tear-filled eyes, not daring to call her mother-in-law evil. She hid her sorrow in a smiling face, but what could she do? Crying and laughter were both wrong, and she could not distinguish between bitter and salty. She endured hardship and swallowed her anger. The Shanghai War broke out the following year, and she was ordered by her mother-in-law to go to Ningbo to take refuge. When she returned to Shanghai on April 18 after the war, the defendant treated her as before. She had not been near the dressing table for a long time, and her mood was even more cold. Occasionally, when they met, he showed extreme contempt, avoiding her as if she were a leper and treating her like a servant. She, a mere weak woman, was bound by the rules and teachings, and had long heard the words of joining hands in the bridal chamber. The thought of being buried together in the same grave was truly heartbreaking. Since the situation was worse than sleeping in the same bed with different dreams, the hope of being like a pair of mandarin ducks that grow together on the same branch had been dashed. Alas, the heart of the cold-hearted man was like iron, and the life of the drifting woman was inhumane. If she was shackled for a long time, she would not care about her life. Therefore, she listed all the hardships and appealed to the court, asking to live separately in order to preserve her remaining breath. After receiving the petition, the court summoned the defendant Shao Renfen to court at 11:00 AM yesterday, but he did not appear. Only the petitioner Shao Xu and her lawyers Peng and Xu appeared in court. Shao Xu testified that she was 25 years old, from Zhenhai, Zhejiang, and currently lived in her uncle's home outside Dadongmen Bridge. In 1929, she formally married Shao Renfen according to the orders of her parents and the words of the matchmaker. Earlier, because her younger sister was getting married, she returned to Ningbo. When she returned to her husband's home, the door was tightly closed. Her husband spat blood and blamed her for not returning sooner, making things difficult for her in every way. At the beginning of their marriage, for about a month, their relationship was quite good. Now, she sleeps upstairs and he sleeps downstairs, as if they were strangers. She asked to be allowed to live separately. The judge asked how she would like to be supported. She replied that she needed 120 yuan per month for living expenses, and since she was 25 years old now, she would need over 50,000 yuan to live until she was 60 years old, and also the return of 30,000 yuan for clothing expenses. The judge said, "Is the defendant able to bear such a huge sum?" She replied, "The defendant is the owner of Tianyi Film Company and also runs Jintaichang Paint Store, owning assets of over one million yuan. It is not excessive to ask for only 80,000 yuan now." After hearing the testimony, the judge ruled that because the defendant did not appear today, the mediation was unsuccessful. She was ordered to pay the litigation fees and file a formal lawsuit. After the ruling, the court was adjourned.</p>
<h3>Yi Yi Xuan Association: Problem of Selling Opium</h3>
<p>The accountant and tea servers all strongly deny it. The judge finds the facts clear and schedules the sentencing.</p>
<p>The Yi Yi Xuan Association, established by Cantonese expatriates in Shanghai, has been around for decades. Recently, the relevant police station discovered that it was running a gambling den and selling opium at its premises at No. 5, Sanhe Lane, Jiangxi Road, and sent undercover agents to search the premises. They seized a quantity of opium paste and paraphernalia, along with the association's accountant, a Cantonese man named Wang Shaoqing, the tea server, Tan Gui, and opium smokers, Hu Tian, ​​who were taken to the First Special District District Court. Hu was sentenced to a fine of 60 yuan and sent to the hospital for 20 days of rehabilitation. Wang and Tan were detained pending further investigation to determine whether they were selling opium privately. This was reported in the previous newspapers. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide continued to bring the defendants before the court for further investigation. However, no one admitted to selling opium paste, and all claimed that the opium was brought by the members themselves and placed in the association. Even the opium paraphernalia was brought to the association by the members, which is why there were markings on the ash trays. Judge Feng pointed out that the case file clearly stated that Tan Gui had received several tens of yuan from the sale of opium residue, and that the character "earth" (土, slang for opium) also appeared in the accounting books. He repeatedly questioned the two defendants, but they were evasive throughout. The court then ruled that the facts were clear and ordered the start of the debate. First, police lawyer Wang Yaotang spoke, saying that based on the evidence in the case, the evidence against the two defendants for selling opium seemed weak, but the fact that they sold opium residue was clear, and they should be punished according to the law. As for the association's gambling and opium sales, which violated the association's rules, this could be pursued in a separate case. Next, the defendants' lawyer, Fan Ganglian, argued that those who came to the association were all wealthy men, and the defendants dared not interfere even if they saw them smoking opium, because if they were not careful and provoked their anger, they would lose their jobs. The money from the sale of opium residue cannot be equated with the sale of opium. He requested that the judge make a clear distinction. Judge Feng then ruled that the sentence would be announced next Tuesday, and the two defendants were taken back to the police station for detention.</p>
<h3>Three Buddhist Organizations Schedule Farewell for Dharma Master Narada</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that Dharma Master Narada, who came east to spread Buddhism, is scheduled to depart for the South Seas Islands on the 22nd. The Chinese Buddhist Association, the Shanghai Buddhist Association, and the Buddhist Pure Land Society will hold a farewell meeting at Jueyuan at 4:00 PM on the 19th.</p>
<h3>Special District Rickshaw Pullers Petition Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Chinese Director, Yesterday, Requesting Four Matters to be Approved with a Response Within Days</h3>
<p>More than twenty representatives of the special district rickshaw pullers, including Zhu Fengxiang, Xu Zhulin, Cang Gongwen, Xia Huaixiang, and Zhu Richang, petitioned Mr. Yu Qiaqing, the Chinese director of the Municipal Council, yesterday morning regarding the election of rickshaw puller directors. They requested: (1) The rickshaw numbers to be published should include the names of the rickshaw pullers; (2) The general secretary and deputy secretary of the Mutual Aid Society should not participate in the rickshaw puller elections; (3) The three members of the Rickshaw Affairs Committee should not participate in the elections; (4) Mr. Yu should take the lead in representing the rickshaw pullers. Mr. Yu agreed to respond to the rickshaw pullers' requests within days.</p>
<h3>The Eighty-Fifth Group of Overseas Chinese Expelled from Japan Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yao Fuquan and Six Others Arrived; The Eighty-Fourth Group Has Already Returned to Their Hometowns</p>
<p>The eighty-fifth group of overseas Chinese expelled from Japan, including Yao Fuquan (from Rui'an, Zhejiang), Wu Tingqi, Chen Ranxun, Jiang Yan'cheng, Wang Bingjin, Lin Luyan, and Lin Meiyan (all from Qingtian, Zhejiang), a total of seven people, were all laborers in Japan. They were escorted to Shanghai by the Japanese Mail Steamship Company's Rokko Maru at 5 p.m. yesterday in a very disheveled state. They are currently lodging at the Laogongxin Inn at the Sixteenth Bund and plan to petition the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau today for relief. According to a reporter from the Daily News, the eighty-fourth group of fourteen people, including Yao Chenggu, who arrived in Shanghai a few days ago, were issued half-price tickets by the Public Security and Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureaus and have returned to their hometown of Wenzhou to make a living.</p>
<h3>Fish Traders Request a Fish Market; Hire Advanced Fisheries Experts as Managers; The Fish Market is Carefully Considering</h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the Ministry of Industry's fish market, which has been under construction since bidding last year, is now fully completed. It was originally planned to open at the end of last month, but the opening was delayed due to the market's organizational law and the fish traders' concerns about the imperial system. Currently, the market preparation office is drafting an organizational law for submission to the ministry for review while also addressing the fish traders' concerns. Originally, after the market opened for business, all the fish traders in the Sixteenth Bund area of ​​the city would have to close. The market plans to imitate the Japanese central wholesale market model and use the closed fish trader owners as brokers in the market. However, they would have to pay a deposit of 3,000 yuan upon entering the market, and the commission given would only be 3%, while the fish traders in the past charged 11% per 100 yuan of value as commission, which is a significant difference. Therefore, there is strong opposition. According to a person in the fishing industry who told the reporter yesterday, in order to achieve a comprehensive solution, the market will accommodate the opinions of the fish traders as much as possible. It is said that the fish traders requested that the market should hire advanced members of the local fishing industry or people related to fish traders to serve as managers or assistant managers in order to achieve thorough cooperation. The market is still considering this proposal.</p>

<h3>The Maoli Collides with the Sanbei</h3>
<p>The Sanbei is Out of Service for Repairs; The Maoli Continues to Sail as Usual</p>
<p>The Maoli, a ship of the Maoli Company in the South City, returned to Shanghai from Chongming yesterday. At 11:35 p.m. on the 14th, while sailing to the Niutougang of Beisha, it collided with the Sanbei, a ship of the Sanbei Company on the same route, which had arrived earlier. The Maoli turned around as usual at the dock, and its bow crashed into the left outer cabin of the bow of the Sanbei, which was anchored. The iron plates were damaged in the collision. The two shipowners inspected the damage together, and the Sanbei first weighed anchor and sailed to Qinglonggang to load and unload cargo and passengers. Unexpectedly, after anchoring in Qinglonggang, the Maoli followed and sailed to the vicinity of the Sanbei, again colliding with the left outer cabin of the bow of the Sanbei. After the two collisions, the damage to the Sanbei was even greater than before. However, because the damage was on the upper part of the ship, it did not cause water damage, and it was still able to barely sail to Shanghai. After entering the port yesterday, it unloaded cargo and passengers at the South City Wharf, and the shipowner reported to the company. The Maoli also returned to Shanghai. The Sanbei Company reported the details of the incident to the Navigation Administration Bureau and requested that a surveyor be sent to the South City Wharf to board the ship for inspection. The surveyor saw that three pieces of the iron plate on the outer rail of the bow of the Sanbei had been destroyed, and the wooden frame on the ship had also been destroyed, damaging several feet, causing considerable damage. Then, the surveyor inspected the Maoli and saw that the bow of the ship was also bent inward due to the collision, but it was not broken and had been newly repaired not long ago, so it did not hinder navigation. The surveyor of the Navigation Administration Bureau asked the shipowners of the Sanbei and Maoli about the cause of the accident. First, the owner of the Sanbei reported that the ship was hit while anchored. Then, the owner of the Maoli said that the collision was caused by the water turbulence during the turning. Because the Sanbei was more severely damaged, the company decided to suspend operations and immediately begin repairs. The Maoli was damaged in the bow, but it did not affect navigation, and the Navigation Administration Bureau allowed it to continue to operate. At 5 p.m. yesterday, the Maoli had normally loaded cargo and passengers and set off for Chongsha.</p>
<h3>The Commercial Press Small Loan Fund Committee is Established</h3>
<p>Because the main factory of the Commercial Press was destroyed and closed down, all employees were dismissed with government approval. Since the resumption of business in August of the 21st year, most of the old employees who have been reinstated and those who indirectly serve the company outside have been rehired, but there are still a few unemployed people staying in Shanghai. In order to help them solve their employment problems, the company has decided to allocate 50,000 yuan from the Class B special reserve fund to establish a Small Loan Fund Committee, appointing Li Dachao, Zhu Maocheng, He Qingru, Hua Weizhong, Zhou Youju, Zhang Shuliang, Yu Zhonghua, Shi Jiuyun, and Xu Baiqi as members, and cooperating with the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Institute. Yesterday, the establishment meeting was held at the Bank Club on Hong Kong Road. Zhu Maocheng was elected as the chairman, and Li Dachao, He Qingru, and Shi Jiuyun were elected as standing committee members. Xu Baiqi was elected as the secretary. The committee hired Yang Chongyu, Huang Jingwan, and Zhuang Tongsan as staff members. The office is located at the Chinese Vocational Education Society at the intersection of Hualong Road and Huanlong Road in this port. On the 21st of this month, registration and investigation procedures will begin. It is commendable that the company is so enthusiastic about helping its employees and has such a comprehensive plan. The company's declaration, the charter of the fund committee, and the detailed rules of procedure are attached below.</p>
<p>Declaration: Notice to all. According to the company's charter, if there is a surplus in the annual account, a certain percentage will be allocated to the public welfare fund, which is the source of resources for the welfare undertakings of all employees, the reconstruction fund of the Oriental Library, etc. Since the resumption of business in August of the 21st year of the Republic of China, after suffering deep pain and hardship, we have relied on the diligence and hard work of our colleagues internally and the guidance and support of the society externally. Fortunately, there has been a slight surplus in recent years, and the public welfare fund has been replenished. To date, colleague welfare undertakings, such as disease assistance, life insurance, incentive savings, and children's education, have been successively established, and the reconstruction of the Oriental Library is gradually taking shape. In view of the result of the social depression, the number of unemployed people in Shanghai is increasing. Among the old employees of the company who were laid off due to the January 28th Incident, more than a thousand people have been reinstated one after another. Including those who indirectly serve the company and those who have other jobs, there should also be no less than a thousand people. However, there are still quite a few people who are currently unemployed or who have been employed and then unemployed again and are stranded in Shanghai. At a time when industry and commerce are declining, the solution to the employment problem is becoming increasingly difficult. The company is also affected by the depression and is gradually falling into overproduction. It is difficult to fulfill the wish of building thousands of mansions, and it is also impossible to give out robes everywhere. Therefore, based on the meaning of helping oneself and helping others, we will seek to help others and help oneself. We believe that if the unemployed are determined to help themselves, even if it is difficult to find jobs in large enterprises due to the depression, small-scale business efforts may still be possible. The combination of labor and capital is production. Everyone has labor, but what is lacking is capital. However, capital has great uses for large amounts and small uses for small amounts. It is common to see people who use tens of yuan of capital for small-scale business and are able to support themselves. The key to their success is nothing more than obtaining a small amount of capital and then acting carefully under the guidance of experienced people. The company is willing to do its best to allocate 50,000 yuan from the public welfare fund to establish a small loan fund to help the old employees who are unemployed and stranded in Shanghai solve the problem of capital. We have also extended invitations to people who are enthusiastic about social undertakings to organize a committee to preside over its distribution, and we are cooperating with the experienced Shanghai Vocational Guidance Institute to provide guidance on employment issues to the old employees who are unemployed and stranded in Shanghai. However, the key to success ultimately depends on the ability of the operators to be diligent and cautious. Therefore, the final problem still depends on the self-planning solution of each individual. The matter is a pioneering effort, and the success or failure of its experiment is closely related to social problems and is not limited to the livelihoods of a few people. In addition to sincerely hoping that unemployed old employees will use assistance to work hard to help themselves, we hope that people of all walks of life will teach us. Sincerely, Commercial Press, October, 24th year.</p>

<h3>Hua Bei Road; The Reduction of Rent in Nan Lu Fang is Realized</h3>
<p>Nan Lu Fang on Gang Kou Hua De Road is located in a remote area, and the houses are old. It is the property of the well-known gentleman Yao Nanji. The market has been sluggish in recent years, and this place is the most affected. The tenants living in the neighborhood all complain that the rent is too expensive, and many have moved out, causing the sub-landlords to complain incessantly. The tenants have initiated a request for the landlord to reduce the rent. After running around and appealing for months, it was all in vain. It is heard that lawyer Xi Yuchang has been appointed to mediate, with a 10% reduction. After months of standoff, it has finally been resolved.</p>
<h3>The Da Yu Collides with a Barge</h3>
<p>The Da Yu, a ship of the Da Da Company, entered Shanghai from Tongzhou on the 14th of this month. At 3:07 or 08 p.m., while moving slowly to buoy No. 5 of the same bureau, it was about to dock at public pier No. 4 when a barge fully loaded with flour was traveling from north to west in front of it. At that time, the Da Yu was behind and stopped to wait. The barge passed the ship and then turned to Puxi. Unexpectedly, the barge suddenly turned its head towards Pudong, causing the bow of the Da Yu to collide with the stern of the barge. Fortunately, the flour was not damaged, but the horizontal side panel and the water gate were damaged in the collision. The barge owner has not yet arrived to negotiate, so the insurance company has been notified first.</p>

<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, the Shanghai National Products Company on Nanjing Road has been closed for nearly half a year.

<h3>Dr. Yu Bin, Director General of the Catholic Action Association, Goes to Jinan for Inspection</h3>
<p>Dr. Yu Bin, Director General of the Chinese Catholic Action Association, came to Shanghai on August 20th to preside over the preparation for the National Congress of the Catholic Action Association. In the blink of an eye, it has been two months. The congress is large-scale and the affairs are heavy, but Dr. Yu is knowledgeable and full of energy, so he can handle it with ease, in an orderly manner, and with excellent results. Because of the invitation of Bishop Yang Dunpin of Jinan, he took the Shanghai-Ping-Tong train to Jinan last night (15th) to inspect and guide the local Catholic Action Association and disaster relief education work. He will also give lectures in middle and high schools and will return to Ping around the end of the month.</p>
<h3>Zhang Shuiqi of the Eastern Travel Agency Arrives in Shanghai to Discuss That There Will Be No Through Train Service Between Customs and Abroad</h3>
<p>Business is Still Good, With an Annual Income of More Than Two Million Yuan; The Currency System of the Puppet State is Different, Causing Us Considerable Losses</p>
<p>—The Meeting in Peiping Only Discussed Technical Issues—</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Shuiqi, the manager of the Eastern Travel Agency, which organizes the through train service between customs and abroad on the Peiping-Shenyang route, left Peiping a few days ago and arrived in Shanghai on the Shanghai-Ping-Tong train yesterday morning. He stayed at a hotel. The Dagong News Agency reporter visited him and he gave a detailed account of the business situation of the Peiping-Shenyang through train and the situation inside and outside the customs. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Business is Still Good, But There Are Still Losses</p>
<p>After the opening of the through train service on the Beining Railway on July 1st of last year, there were not many passengers at the time, and the business did not improve. However, it gradually improved. Now there are many passengers, with an annual income of 2 million yuan. However, the expenses of the Eastern Travel Agency are about more than 90,000 yuan per year, and its expenses are taken from the 5% ticket commission. Therefore, based on an annual income of 2 million yuan, it can make up for the past losses. However, the Travel Agency and the Beining Railway Bureau do not have the same market value for the currency systems of the puppet state and China. One yuan of the puppet currency is only equivalent to 7 jiao of Chinese currency. Therefore, passengers from Peiping-Tianjin to Shenyang often buy tickets to Shanhaiguan first, and then buy tickets to the puppet state at Shanhaiguan. This section of the fare can be calculated in puppet currency, and there are fewer passengers from inside the customs to outside the customs than from outside the customs to inside the customs. Therefore, the fare sold outside the customs is also more than that inside the customs. Every time the accounts are settled, the Beining Railway Bureau suffers a considerable loss. Now, both parties have agreed to exchange the currency at the market price, so that the market value of Chinese currency and puppet currency can be balanced. After the implementation of this system, the Beining Railway and the Travel Agency will not suffer any losses.</p>
<p>No Through Transport; External Rumors Are Not Accurate</p>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reporter asked whether it was true that the rumors outside that there would be through transport between customs and abroad were true. Zhang said that this was not true, because the joint operation of passenger through trains between the Beining Railway Bureau and the South Manchuria Railway had already taken a lot of effort. Moreover, Japanese people outside the customs have an international transportation company organization. The company is large in scale, with a total capital of 10 million yuan. Most of the goods transported inside and outside the customs are handled by the company, and there is no need for it in fact.</p>
<p>Meetings in Peiping; Discussing Technology</p>
<p>As for the meeting of representatives of the Beining Railway and the South Manchuria Railway in Peiping this time, it was purely to discuss the technical problems on the current through trains, such as the procedures for ticket refunds, changes in the wording of accounting books, improvements in other minor procedures, and the regulations on currency exchange between customs and abroad. All attendees were representatives. As for the Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, Yin Tong, going to Peiping, it was not to attend the meeting, but because the Beining Railway Train Children Training Institute opened, and he went to deliver a speech. Outsiders did not know the facts and mistakenly thought that Yin's attendance was to participate in the discussion on through transport between customs and abroad. Zhang also said that his coming to Shanghai this time was because time was short and he did not have time to take care of it, so he returned to Shanghai to arrange everything. He will stay in Shanghai for a few days and then go north.</p>
<h3>Dr. Zhang Fayao, Who Studied Economics in France, Will Return Home Soon</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Fayao, the eldest son of the well-known Shanghai figure Zhang Xiaolin, graduated from the Shanghai Sino-French School. In the spring of the 17th year of the Republic of China, he went to France to study at the University of Paris, majoring in political economics. He has gained a lot of experience and has written books on social economics and social insurance, which are praised by Chinese and foreign people. He has now obtained a doctoral degree and will return to China soon.</p>
<h3>Dr. Sun Kejin Returns to China</h3>
<p>Dr. Sun Kejin went to Vienna, the birthplace of European medicine, last year to practice radium electrotherapy and the latest medical techniques. He obtained a specialist certificate in dermatology and urology from the Austrian National Hospital. He then went to the University of Hamburg in Germany to study various subjects and obtained a doctorate degree with honors. He arrived in Shanghai on the Italian postal ship Conte recently. He has set up a clinic at the Sino-Western Pharmacy on Fuzhou Road and the Xiude New Village on Chengdu Road. Once the newly purchased latest-style Juedao mirror thermal cautery machine, sun lamp, and shortwave machine arrive in Shanghai, he will publish an advertisement for consultation.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Yayue Society has scheduled a musical tea party to be held at the YMCA of Eight Immortals Bridge in the French Concession from 4:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. on the 19th of this month (Saturday).

<h3>General Meeting of Members of the National Rubber Products Industry</h3>
<p>Since the re-election of the board of directors of the National Rubber Products Industry Association of this city last month, the members have been full of energy and extremely active. Recently, in view of the influx of foreign goods on the market and the complexity of brands, they decided to rectify the situation. Yesterday at 4 p.m., a general meeting of member representatives was convened at the Yijia Chun Western Restaurant on Fourth Road. Zhao Zhihui of Nanhua, Yang Weiyin of Dachunghua, Gu Zhizhong of Yongda, Tang Hezhong of Minsheng, Su Gongxuan of Yihe, Yu Qiusheng of Dade, Wang Jing of Yichang, Hong Jiugao of Zhengda, Li Baosheng of Yisheng, Yang Yongnian of Shijie, Ye Shanxing of Dagongzhongguofuli, Xu Mengwei of Gongshang, Zhu Yuqing of Dalu, Wang Xinpu of Huaxing, Huang Yongqin of Yiyuan, Wang Chao of Xie Kang, Yu Xinyuan of Jiaotong, Wang Shuxun of Shanghai Industrial, Wang Shirong of Hongda, Yang Weiyin of Yonghe, Yu Xingshu of Dai Da Zhong Yang, Weng Zupei of Dai Huatong, and Su Jichang of Liexi Zhengtai Xinji and more than 30 other companies attended.

<h3>Pre-Order of Selected Famous Ming Dynasty Prose Writers</h3>
<p>The most notable era for short prose pieces was the Ming Dynasty, with the Three Yuan of Gong'an and Zhong Tan of Jingling being highly praised by contemporaries as outstanding figures in Ming Dynasty prose. In reality, figures such as Xu Wenchang and Tang Bohu of the High Ming period, and Chen Meigong and Tang Ruoshi of the Late Ming period, were arguably no less significant than the Three Yuan and Zhong Tan. Yuan Zhonglang rarely gave approval, but he did comment on the collection of Xu Wenchang and reviewed the poems of Tang Bohu, demonstrating the brilliance of their poetry and prose. Yuan's commentary editions are now rare, only occasionally found among collectors. Now, the owner of Dadao Bookstore is releasing their treasured collections of the complete works of Xu Wenchang, Chen Meigong, Tang Ruoshi, Tang Bohu, Zhu Zhishan, and Wen Zhengming, to be published as the "Complete Works of Six Famous Ming Dynasty Prose Writers" in twelve thick volumes, priced at twenty-six yuan. A pre-order discount of fifteen percent reduces the price to only three yuan and sixty cents. Individual volumes can also be ordered separately. Fine-bound editions are also available for scholars to collect. Pre-orders will close at the end of this month, presenting a rare opportunity for those who enjoy reading short prose pieces. It is reported that the complete works of Xu Wenchang and Chen Meigong will be released first on November 10th.</p>
<h3>Publication by China Post on Zheng</h3>
<p>The book "China Post, Volume I," written by Mr. Zhang, Director of the Savings Department of the Shanghai Postal Remittances Bureau and Doctor of Economics from Germany, has now been included in the Commercial Press's University Series for publication. The book is divided into three volumes, detailing the historical development of China Post, its current system, and indicating areas for future improvement, totaling five hundred thousand words. It is truly the only specialized book on China Post.</p>

<p>Occasional Notes</p>
<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Zheng Yimei)</p>
<p>The mind must be calm, the spirit must be passionate. The shadow of flowers enhances the painter's inspiration, the trace of the moon adds to my sentimental moments.</p>
<p>The trend of performing Chinese plays is prevalent in Europe and America. Tracing its origins, it began in 1692 when the Italian celebrity Regudarb performed the Chinese drama "Les Chinoise" before the imperial court, at the Hotel Courgognc in Prologue.</p>
<p>Floral fabric is considered outdated. Some have green backgrounds with white flowers, while others have white backgrounds with green flowers. Nowadays, only women north of the Yangtze River occasionally wear it. The other day, I saw Ms. Yin Mingzhu in a specially made floral fabric cheongsam with a novel design. Wearing it for photographs enhanced her beauty, transforming the rotten into the magical. Only she could do it.</p>
<p>The forte of promotion is self-praise, the skill of advertising is to deceive people.</p>
<p>The more society evolves, the more morality declines.</p>
<p>Talking about poetry and literature with modern women, or discussing movies and plays with impoverished scholars, is equally clueless.</p>
<p>A certain celebrity, unable to vent his indignation, wrote a couplet and pasted it on his door: "The Buddha said it cannot be spoken," "Confucius said, what is to be done?" I think these two sentences can be used in other contexts. The first line refers to the past "September 18th" anniversary, while the second line refers to the future "January 28th" National Humiliation Day.</p>
<p>The moon gets its light from the sun. This is the statement of modern scientists. Unexpectedly, thousands of years ago, our country already had this saying. Zhang Heng's Ling Xian said: "The moon is perfect in shape and pure in quality, receiving light from the sun." This shows a glimpse of the ancient understanding of astronomy.</p>
<h3>The Standard Worker</h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>My neighbor, the carpenter Ah Wu, is called the "standard worker" by everyone. At first, I didn't quite understand the origin of this honorific. Later, after I investigated Ah Wu's life, I realized that this title was indeed appropriate for him.</p>
<p>It turns out that although Ah Wu is a worker, he is very disciplined in his life. When to get up? When to start work? When to rest? When to sleep? He always has a set time for everything. Except for special circumstances, he does not change his regular routine. He also has a standard for managing his monthly income. How much for household expenses? How much for personal spending? How much for adding things? How much for savings? Everything is spent according to the standard, without wasting a bit. Therefore, his finances never feel tight, and naturally, his spirit is also very happy.</p>
<p>Secondly, speaking of Ah Wu's character, he is also very amiable. He treats everyone with politeness, so everyone likes to be friends with him, and his work becomes particularly busy. However, no matter how busy he is, he always does his work happily, without uttering a single complaint.</p>
<p>Because Ah Wu has these strengths, everyone changed his title to "standard worker." I think this is very right, because everything about the carpenter Ah Wu is worthy of emulation by ordinary workers.</p>
<h3>Autumn Fish Spawning Season</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yan</p>
<p>On the coast, fishermen go out to sea to catch fish, dividing the year into four fishing seasons, which serve as the standard for departure and return: spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Now is the season of autumn, which is the start of the autumn fishing season. Let's talk about the "autumn fishing season":</p>
<p>The fishermen had not rested long from the end of the summer fishing season when autumn arrived. So, as usual, they set out to sea in their fishing boats. However, autumn is not like the other fishing seasons, where they can have calm seas and safely set up their nets to catch fish. Throughout the autumn, fishing boats drift on the ocean, almost always in an environment of wind and waves, battered by rain and waves. So, the lives of fishermen are constantly at risk of ending up in the bellies of fish and shrimp!</p>
<p>In the autumn fishing season, the fish caught by fishermen at sea are mostly pomfret, scaled fish, croaker, ghost crabs, scorpionfish, etc. Because the tides on the sea in autumn rise several to ten times higher than usual, coupled with the gradually cooling weather, the migration of fish becomes unpredictable, and they also do not swim upstream. Therefore, fishing is considered the most difficult in the autumn fishing season. Fishermen moor their boats at night near small islands or corners of the beach in the harbor. When it dawns, they sail their boats out to sea. After one or two days to three or four days, when the fish holds are full, they return to the fishing port to sell their catch. But, often, there are times when they don't catch many fish in three or four days. On windy and rainy nights, the waves are whipped up to the sky by the headwind. There are always several fishing boats that are unable to return, struggling for their remaining lives under the onslaught of the adverse forces!</p>
<p>But although they brave the deep sea, disregarding their lives, to fight the wind and waves for a living, the price they get in return is extremely meager.</p>
<h3>Thinner Than Yellow Flowers</h3>
<p>— Juan Yin</p>
<h3>Debt Collection</h3>
<p>— Zhu Weixuan</p>
<p>Everyone knows Little Zhang in S. Port's dance halls. It's an honor for the girls to have a dance with him.</p>
<p>Little Zhang became so famous because of his family's tens of thousands of dollars of ill-gotten gains. Because of this, he's able to immerse himself day and night in a life of extravagance and indulgence.</p>
<p>Because he spent money like water and acted generously, he naturally gained the favor of many dancers. Under the double threat of power and money, not a few dancers were tempted and lost their bodies. As for those who danced with him once, there are as many as grains of sand on the Ganges River.</p>
<p>His limited money couldn't stand his excessive spending. In just two or three years, his hundreds of thousands of dollars were completely waltzed away into the dancers' pockets. After Little Zhang danced away almost all his property, he abandoned his plain wife and his beautiful and lively eight-year-old daughter and quietly left S. Port, no one knows where he went.</p>
<p>From then on, Little Zhang's trace could not be found in the dance halls, and his image disappeared from the minds of every dancer!</p>
<p>Ten years later, a glittering star suddenly appeared in S. Port's X dance hall and was elected dance queen of S. Port. Her name is Zhang Lingling. Her nightly income from dance tickets is always over hundreds of dollars. So, even though she's a dancer, she's accumulated wealth.</p>
<p>Later, according to people familiar with the matter, this dance queen who earns ten thousand dollars a month is actually the daughter of the formerly wealthy young man—Little Zhang—who spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in the dance halls. So, the general humorous opinion is that Zhang Lingling is here to collect the debt her father incurred ten years ago. However, this method of debt collection doesn't seem very honorable, does it?</p>

<h3>The Basque Ball Game is Popular in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Shanghai News Agency</p>
<p>A narrative of the Central Sports Field, Jai Alai, and Boxing</p>
<p>Jai alai, a ball game of the ancient Basque people, was introduced to Shanghai from Spain only six years ago, and has now become one of the most popular indoor sports in Shanghai.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1928, a joint-stock company called Central Sports Field – Parc des Sports in French, Auditorium in English – emerged with the purpose of introducing jai alai and promoting boxing. After enough shares were raised and the venue was built, professional jai alai players were recruited from Cairo, Egypt, Alexandria, Virginia, and Barcelona, Spain.</p>
<p>The ancient jai alai competition made its first appearance before the audience at the Central Sports Field on February 7, 1929. That night, twenty-four contestants participated in this grand opening program.</p>
<p>The high speed of competition is one of the reasons why jai alai is most attractive to learners, but it is difficult for Shanghai athletes to learn it, so it was not until December 1930, when newly recruited artists came from overseas, that the ball game could be fully continued.</p>
<p>With new jai alai players coming from Cuba, Brazil, and Spain, jai alai achieved definite success in Shanghai. On August 20, 1931, the Central Sports Field performed a special program to raise money for flood relief, and the net amount of money raised for flood victims was 4,000 yuan.</p>
<p>In January 1932, the Central Sports Field was temporarily closed due to the outbreak of the war between China and Japan in Zhabei. It reopened on March 1. At that time, the starting time of the race was 7:00 PM, so that the audience could return home before the 10:00 PM curfew.</p>
<p>The general manager of the Central Sports Field and captain of the jai alai team is Jauregui Teodoro, the manager is AHaig, and the secretary and advertising director and boxing introducer is T. D. Sofoulis.</p>
<p>Boxing competitions are often staged as entertainment for Shanghai audiences with magnificent human body defense skills, but the attraction is not great. The best Shanghai boxers have shown their skills in many competitions in the past few years.</p>
<p>Although jai alai is mainly a professional sport in Shanghai, the general manager of the Central Sports Field has also had considerable success in encouraging amateur athletes to participate in this ancient Basque sport. Amateur competitions are held from time to time, and exquisite awards are given to the winners.</p>
<p>The Central Sports Field is backed by a group of powerful financiers, led by F. Bouvier. Bouvier is the chairman of the board of directors of the field, the manager of the Huifeng Bank, and the director of the French Racing Club (dog racing club).</p>
<p>The vice chairman of the board of directors is C. Ballaodra, and the other directors are: Su Fanai, Shen Changgeng, Baibaode, Nicole, and Ye Keweiwei. George is the supervisor.</p>
<h3>Records of Fleeting Fragrance</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Once the Empress Dowager's body and buttocks are completely covered with soap, the first step of the work is completed. The four palace maids discard the towels in their hands together, and each picks up a new towel, soaking it in warm water first, and then taking it out and wringing it dry. This time, however, no soap is applied, and the towels are wrung out more wetly. The procedure is to wipe off the soap that has just been applied and the dirt that has been wiped off by the soap, so the wiping time is also longer. After this wiping is done, there must be a final dry wipe, which requires four more towels to be replaced.</p>
<p>After going through three wipes like this, the Empress Dowager's upper body is of course very clean, but things are not so simple! As soon as the four palace maids put down the last towel, they busily took a jar of heated camellia dew - which the Empress Dowager applies to her face every night - and used four balls of pure white silk cotton, soaked in the dew, generously applying it to the Empress Dowager's body. After each part is completely covered, they take four other clean towels to gently pat her dry. This is really a lot of trouble!</p>
<p>When the wiping work is done to this point, it is of course the ultimate! The second step is to take a set of clean pajamas and trousers for the Empress Dowager, and first put on the pajamas for her, so that her upper body will not get cold. Then, the Empress Dowager herself takes off her inner trousers, completely naked to her toes, and the lower half of her body is completely exposed. Then, four other palace maids who are dedicated to rough work, receive a signal from the four palace maids inside, and carry in another bathtub, which is also wooden and covered with silver skin.

<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 20: Striving for Life, Watching Clever Grandson Hug and Shed Tears, Desolate Year, Planting Wheat from the Past Brings Disaster</p>
<p>The old lady trembled and suddenly stretched out her hands, clasped her palms together, and bowed to Zhiqian, saying: Mr. Cheng...you are a savior in times of distress, you...saved my...my life. Zhiqian didn't have any feelings for this drifting woman from the Zhu family in the south, but seeing her pitiful appearance, he felt a burst of sadness in his heart, and he couldn't help but two lines of tears flowed down, so he turned his face away and waved his hand to them, calling out: You all come with me. He took a few steps before stopping and turning back to look. Because the sour feeling that surged from his heart had been suppressed after a few steps, the two lines of tears that were about to fall did not flow out, and he could see people. At this time, the old lady was full of energy, and she didn't know where it came from. She didn't need anyone to help her, but held Zhu Hu's arms with one hand and followed. Mrs. Hu was hiding left and right behind her, just protecting her. She said: No, no...it's okay, isn't it? Don't let my Yue'er be implicated in this matter, right? Zhiqian straightened his chest and said: It's okay, I'll take responsibility with you no matter how big the matter is. As he said that, he slowly led the way in front. When he arrived in front of Jia Duocai's room, Zhiqian called out: Mrs. Jia, come out and see, your...Yueying. Just as he was stretching his head out by the door, he saw the old lady, ran over and shouted: My grandma, with just this sentence, he had run to the old lady, grabbed the old lady's lapels with both hands and shook her randomly. Below, he couldn't say a word, he just cried. (340)</p>

<p>Steadily Rising Swap Premiums; Gold Market Rises Then Falls Again</p>
<p>People Blindly Following, Raising Prices Too High; Long Positions Liquidated, Resulting in a Drop of 3.4 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday was a rollover day in the gold market, which could have been calm, but people blindly followed and raised prices too high, triggering selling activity. Swap premiums steadily rose, floating long positions came out, and prices ultimately fell. In the early morning, overseas silver markets in the UK and US were stable, Mundell's forward silver prices were unchanged, and Changliu barely moved. Exchange rates were stable, and London spot gold rose by half a penny. People's minds were stabilized, and preliminary off-market trading was around 11 yuan. Fuxingyong immediately sold, lowering the price to 10 yuan. Major players such as Hengyu, Fuxingyong, Yuanchangyong, etc., returned to buy. The Central Bank's official exchange rate was announced, with the UK and US stable, and the customs gold unit unchanged. The standard gold price was listed at 922.4 yuan, still looking prosperous, even rising to over 13 yuan. The morning opened with high prices, still strong after opening. However, banks suddenly showed strong buying appetite, and major players competed to purchase bars, leaving the market dry. For a time, sellers gave up. Reports that the Bank of China would issue 50 million yuan in new banknotes became a topic of conversation among traders. General blind followers gathered like wind and clouds, stirring up a rising tide. However, major players sold bars at high prices, knowing that HSBC's official exchange rate would reduce by 0.25 for British currency and 0.5 yuan for US currency. Thereafter, prices rose and fell repeatedly for a long time. Later, HSBC offered shillings, gradually moving downstream. Swap trading began tentatively, with premiums difficult to reach 4-5 yuan, but not as large as rumored. People's minds calmed down, and although prices were low, there was a lot of trading. Subsequently, HSBC Shanghai repeatedly offered, and the exchange rate tightened, slightly increasing the swap premium. Sellers turned eager and exhausted, predicting a 0.03 anna reduction in Indian silver. At noon, the market was still stable. Later, the market was peaceful and fluctuated. Although there was a decline, the initial report of a 5.44 anna reduction in Indian silver made it easy to pull up. However, HSBC repeatedly dumped near-term shillings, and swap premiums rose, ultimately showing exhaustion. As the swap premium rose to around 6 yuan, the selling wave finally surged, retreating within the 10 yuan mark. Indian silver rebounded by 1 anna for the second time. Thereafter, the swap premium increased without decreasing, and rumors of pessimistic international events caused buyers to watch from the sidelines, leading to the liquidation of floating long positions. The drop was rapid for a short time, resulting in exhaustion. The future market is still fluctuating. The day's market conditions are recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 912.7 yuan, a rise of 4 yuan compared to the previous close. Hengfuxingyong immediately advanced to 4.3 yuan. Hengchangyong, Yonglifuyu sold, retreating to 2.6 yuan.

Wanxing, Hengyu, Fuxingyong, Dadecheng, Feifayonglai came in, rising to 2 yuan. Yuansheng Yong and Hengyu Chunyuan Yong sold again, falling to 0.03 yuan. The initial report for Indian silver was a small 5.44 anna. Hengyu, Dingkang, and Yuanmaoyong took advantage of the low price to advance to 2.5 yuan. Fuyuyongfeng sold, retreating again to 0.06 yuan, because the swap premium rose to 5.34 yuan. However, the market still fluctuated. Later, as swap premiums increased without decreasing, Huixiang, Dada, Fuyu, and Fuxingyong sold bars, retreating to 0.091 yuan. Wanfeng maintained and rose to 9.6 yuan. Indian silver rebounded 1.1.1 anna for the second time. Tongfu and Jiarun, Quandecheng competed to sell, falling to 8.1 yuan. Hengyu and Chunyuan Yong still advanced to 8.8 yuan. Later, as floating long positions wavered repeatedly, rumors of urgent international winds and clouds caused Hengyu, Hengchangyong, Yuxinxian, Richang, Wanfeng, and Houyu to sell frequently, falling to 4.8 yuan. The closing price was 905.3 yuan. After the close, although Hengyu advanced, scattered long positions and Fusheng Yongruixing sold, falling within 5 yuan. Tongtaichang, Dadecheng, and Chunyuan Yonglai came in, finally rising again to 6.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The settlement price, based on the Central Bank's standard gold price listing, was 922.4 yuan. According to the closing price, the difference was about 17 yuan, which was slightly less than 4 yuan higher than the previous close. The registration price for November was 913 yuan, with morning water compensation at 913 yuan. The afternoon settlement prices were 905 yuan for November and 911 yuan for December, with afternoon water compensation at 905 yuan. Refined gold was increased by 3 yuan to 915.7 yuan. The spot market was stable, and foreign firms continued to supply. Tianjin credit was increased by 7.25 yuan, with Dadecheng buying 350 taels. Refined gold was increased by 8.5 yuan, but no transactions occurred.</p>
<p>On the trading floor, trading was still active. In summary, Hengyu, Dingkang, Yuansheng Yongfu, Yuyifengyong, Tongfu, Tianchengxiangyong, and Deyiwanting, etc., were on the buying side. Chunyuan Yongrichang, Tongtai Yuqingyong, Zhongfeng Yongli, Wangfa, Yongqingfa Yonghengchangyong, Shunmaoyingfeng, Hengyuan Fayong Yongfeng Dada, Futai Hengrui, and Shunli, etc., were on the selling side. Dadecheng and Chunyuan Yongyongli Tongtaichang first sold and then bought. Lifeng and Fuchang Wanfeng first bought and then sold. The Dalian gang, led by Wanxing, made over 500 bars, netting over 100 bars. Shunli made over 100 bars, netting out over 200 bars. Other gangs lacked activity.</p>
<p>The day's market conditions were initially tight and then weak. The agricultural opening was 912.7 yuan, and the final close was 905.3 yuan. The highest price was 917 yuan in the morning, and the lowest was 904.8 yuan in the afternoon, a fluctuation of 12.2 yuan. As a result, the price fell 3.4 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>Preliminary trading for the November-December period began at 10:30 AM. The initial call was for short positions to offer 4.5 to 5 yuan. Yifengyong Qingfayong Hengyu immediately offered, lowering the price to 4 yuan. Because there were not many opponents at this time, Shunmao took advantage of the low price to offer, pulling the price up. Wanxing, Dadecheng, Shunli, Fuyu, Dachangxiang, Chunyuan Yongtongfu, Yuanyi Dingkang Hengyu Hongyu, and Yuanmaoyong, etc., jointly offered, raising the price to 4.8 yuan. Tongtaichang, Fuxing Yicheng Qianchangxiang, and Xianghe came to offer, resulting in a struggle. However, Dadecheng, Shunli Yuanmaoyong, and Hengchangyong still offered, raising the price to 4.9 yuan. Xianghe, Yicheng Qianchangxiang took advantage of the high price to offer, retreating to 4.6 yuan. Dadecheng Yuanmaoyong, Tianfeng Yongyingfeng Heng Huixiang all offered, and the situation remained stable. Dadecheng offered more aggressively, raising the price to 5 yuan. However, because there were many limit-order offers from Hengyu Hengchangyong Fuxingyong Tongyiyuan Changyong Qianchangxiang, etc., the premium was contested. In the afternoon market, Dadecheng Yifengyong Yuanfayong Dachangxiang offered, raising the price to over 5 yuan. However, there were Ruizheng Deliy Qianchangxiang and Fushun Huixiang offering over 5 yuan, still retreating within 5 yuan. Yuanfayong Dadecheng Wanfeng Wuchangxiang Shunli Wanyu, etc., continued to offer. Huixiang Qianchang Fuyanfengyong tried hard to offer, struggling around 5 yuan, which was extremely sluggish. When the official opening came at 3 o'clock, Dadecheng's offer caused the selling party to offer 5 yuan. Huixiang Tongtaichang's offer still had fluctuations. Later, as Hengxing Yingfeng Heng Hengyu Shenfeng Yuanmaoyong Fuxingyong Fuyu Yifengyong, etc., continued to offer, the price gradually rose to 6.23 yuan. Dayuan, etc., took advantage of the offer to offer, and the closing price was 6.2 yuan. After the market closed, there were offers from Dadecheng Hengxing Yuanheng Yuanmaoyong Qingfayong, etc., which raised the price to 6.5 yuan. Fuyu Yonghouyu Yingfeng Heng Dadecheng Xiangfeng Ruiyu offered, and the price finally fell within 6 yuan. The trend seemed stable.</p>

<h3>HSBC Repeatedly Dumps Shillings</h3>
<p>The Process Was Initially Tight But Turned Loose Later</p>
<p>According to foreign news, London big bars, near and far, were stable, and the New York silver market remained unchanged. Mundell's forward silver prices only rose by 0.6, and some were unchanged. London spot gold rose by half a penny. The British pound against the US dollar reduced by 0.125, while the British pound against the French franc, the US dollar against the British pound, and the US dollar against the French franc were all unchanged. People's minds were relatively stable. The counter market opened in the morning with the near-term selling price of British exchange at 1 shilling 6 pence 1875 and the US exchange at 37.1875 yuan, which was 0.0625 tighter for both British and US currencies compared to the previous close. The Central Bank's official exchange rate was announced, with the British and US currencies stable, and the customs gold unit also stable. However, because people's minds were firm and rumors of favorable news persisted, the market remained tight. After the opening, the banks' buying appetite was also strong, and the process was unusually tight. Knowing that HSBC's official exchange rate would reduce by 0.25 for British currency and 0.5 yuan for US currency, the market still fluctuated. Later, as HSBC China Shanghai and other branches successively sold, the process gradually loosened. However, the middle period was extremely mediocre. The forecast for Indian silver was a reduction of 0.03 anna, which hardened and then stabilized at noon, because banks and Bombay were doing swap trading. The market was still tight in the afternoon, and banks sought a balance of supply, doing reciprocal trading. The initial report of a small 5 anna reduction in Indian silver still had a chance to turn around. However, because HSBC repeatedly sold near-term shillings, the trend seemed difficult to determine. Indian silver rebounded by 1 anna for the second time. After entering the market, Chinese merchants' psychology tended to be exhausted, and the process turned loose. By the closing, the near-term selling price for the British pound was 1 shilling 6 pence 125, and the US exchange was 37.0625 yuan, which was 0.125 tighter for the British pound and 0.1875 tighter for the US dollar compared to the previous close. Chinese merchants bought and then sold, with the net result being even. The day's transaction prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>The British exchange opened in the morning with the near-term selling price at 1 shilling 6 pence 1875. HSBC sold 5 pence 935 for November to Zhengjin. Youli bought 8125 for November.

<h3>First Result of the Settlement of Overdue Loans</h3>
<p>Settlement Totaling Over 10 Million; Transfer of 6.6 Million</p>
<p>Yesterday, the 15th, was the due date for the first batch of the sixth long-term settlement. All loans made and transferred before April 15 of the first half of the year were due yesterday. The total amount of overdue loans that needed to be settled yesterday was over 3.4 million yuan from the Chinese banks, over 7 million yuan from the money shops, and 1.56 million yuan from the Ningbo banks. Among them, the results of the settlement were: over 3.2 million yuan transferred by the banks, less than 200,000 yuan recovered, and over 300,000 yuan newly made. The interest rates were 8.75 yuan and 10.05 yuan. The settlement situation of the money shops was: over 6 million yuan were settled and transferred directly, about 670,000 yuan were agreed upon by both parties and transferred accordingly, and over 10 money shops made new loans. The money shops lent about 780,000 yuan to foreign firms, streets, various ports, and foreign firms, with interest rates ranging from 8.75 yuan to 10.5 yuan. The interest rates varied. Over 890,000 yuan were transferred by the Ningbo banks, and 560,000 yuan were repaid by Shanghai banks. Over 100,000 yuan of new loans were made. Old Yongtou-type loans were not released. It was found that the total amount of overdue loans settled on that day was over 10 million yuan. The total amount of long-term deposits that matured was over 2 million yuan. About half of the depositors requested to withdraw their deposits, totaling about 1 million yuan. One-third of the depositors transferred their deposits. The remaining 670,000 yuan were either from new depositors or transferred from old accounts. As for the interest rates, they had to be calculated based on the market conditions within the hall, but this market condition was expected to be released around the 27th or 28th of this month. As far as we can guess, there would be limited difference from the price at the end of April of the first half of the year, generally between 5 yuan and 5.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Large Clearing Period</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the large clearing period of the 15th. The various collections and settlements of banks and money shops were better than usual.

The Guangdong small foreign currency was 700.6 yuan in the morning market and 760.1 yuan in the afternoon market. As a result, it seemed 0.7 yuan less than the previous day's afternoon market. However, the transactions were slightly more only in the morning market, totaling 240,000 yuan. The afternoon market seemed limited, only 95,000 yuan. The copper coins were 500 yuan long, at 339,500 yuan, but the transactions were slightly higher than before, with a price of 12,000 yuan for foreign currency, equivalent to 47,740 strings of copper coins.</p>

<p>Slightly Rebounded in the Afternoon Due to Short Covering</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange was still shrouded in an atmosphere of terror due to the environmental air, and there were even more tea stalls and market rumors were rampant, and people's minds had been shaken. In the morning, all kinds of stocks saw new lows, but the retail short covering was also quite active. The market price rebounded slightly in the afternoon. This kind of big drop and small rebound is most feared by those who do long. The environmental news is difficult to improve temporarily. The number of accounts is still around 55 million. Nos. 4, 43, and 48 have a total of 17 to 18 million long positions. No. 16 has the most short positions, about 7 million, and the rest have at most 1 to 2 million. The strength of the change side is obvious. The future is still in a long-squeeze situation, and the trend is still dangerous. The process yesterday was a sudden rise of 0.1 to 0.6 yuan at the opening. From the unification tax, it suddenly turned smaller due to the large-scale selling of Nos. 14 and 16, and counteracted the smallness by 0.1 to 0.5 yuan. No. 96 was still pulling up and was slightly better. The second market fell again, and the disarmament plummeted by more than 1 yuan. Other stocks also fell across the board, creating the recent lowest price. In the afternoon, at the opening and closing, the retail investors covered their shorts, which was extremely lively. The northern gangs sold aggressively, and Nos. 11 and 14 sold the most. The market price rebounded slightly by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan, but the closing price of the positive six was still trending weak, which was very disappointing for the long side. There should be huge changes in the future. As a result, the market prices were slightly better by 0.1 to 0.4 yuan in the front rows, and 0.1 to 0.5 yuan lower in the back rows. Only No. 96 trended well throughout, rising by 0.35 and 0.4 yuan. This kind of incongruous move obviously had pulling-up, so that the way more long positions could be released. The total number of transactions was 22.2 million yuan. The results of the rise and fall are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<h3>Yarn: Yarn Market Hesitates</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to decline, and the situation remained sluggish, entirely enveloped by terrifying rumors. Furthermore, news reports indicated that Japanese military officials had unanimously decided on a strategy against us, which made people feel even more hesitant, with many focusing on the decline. Consequently, the market was extremely loose. However, Osaka's Three Grades cotton yarn was firm, and various factories had reduced their yarn inventories, so the local market might be somewhat more solid.</p>
<p>Futures Yarn Sold Off by Securities Dealers</p>
<p>The opening of the futures yarn market saw all months displaying sluggishness and a lack of activity, with a dispersed market atmosphere due to the unresolved rumors. After the second session, there was further weakness. However, new sellers were scarce. Osaka-branded yarn rose by two yuan electronically. Ultimately, near-term months rose by one jiao, and far-term months remained flat. The afternoon opening saw a sudden weakening in the situation, and selling became intense. Due to the sluggishness of securities, securities dealers sold off futures yarn, making the market even looser. However, Rui Da, a major bull, continued to buy. As a result, all months fell by four, six, and seven jiao compared to the morning closing price. Sales included Tong Ji 400 bales, Jin Chang 1,250 bales, Zhen Da 300 bales, Ming Hua 350 bales, Chang Feng 900 bales, Da Chang 450 bales, Da Feng 900 bales, Chang Yu 750 bales, Yi Chang 800 bales, Jian Kang 850 bales, and Tong He 800 bales. Purchases included Da Ji 750 bales, Yu Da 600 bales, Xin Chang 600 bales, Geng Feng 1,000 bales, Rui Da 800 bales, Da Fu 750 bales, Xin Cheng 500 bales, He Xing 500 bales, Shen Ji 600 bales, Chang Feng 700 bales, and Xie Cheng 500 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day were as follows:</p>
<p>Futures Yarn  Highest Price  Lowest Price  Closing Price  Change  Outstanding Balance</p>
<p>October  174.5  173.6  173.7  Down 0.60  24,650</p>
<p>November  174.4  173.5  173.7  Down 0.80  48,000</p>

<p>March  175.2  174.3  174.4  Down 0.60  23,700</p>
<p>Total  253,600</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales Reach Over 400 Bales</p>
<p>Sales of spot yarn turned clearer. Statistics showed that various firms bought a total of 446 bales throughout the day. Prices for local yarn remained unchanged, while Japanese yarn fell by 5 jiao to 1 yuan. Purchases by various firms were as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong 25, Jiangxi 15, Inland 20, Henan 10,</p>
<p>Shantou 10, Peers 20, Hankou 6, Sichuan 150.</p>
<p>The cotton market remained weak, mainly due to the unfavorable environment. The yarn market trended downwards, pulling the downstream market along as they are interdependent. However, the amount of cotton arriving at the docks was not as enthusiastic as before, so general cotton merchants and speculators absorbed it to go long.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton: Rui Da Continues to Add to Their Position</p>
<p>The opening of the spot cotton market saw calm trading in all months. Trading within the market was sparse. American cotton fell slightly by one to six points, while Indian cotton rose by 2.5 rupees. As spot gold trended higher and sentiment was stable, the market did not change significantly. Ultimately, various months showed mixed gains and losses, with fluctuations of five fen. The afternoon opening saw a sudden surge in selling. Rumors pointed to unfavorable news, and floating longs were cut. The market gradually declined. However, Rui Da, a major bull, continued to buy, with a particularly large amount. This curbed the downward trend. As a result, all months fell by 1.5 to 2.5 jiao compared to the morning closing price. Sales included Da Fu 1,900 dan, Ji Feng 2,100 dan, Ming De 1,400 dan, Sheng Yuan 1,000 dan, Xin Ting 2,100 dan, Yi Chang 1,600 dan, Wei Feng 2,200 dan, and Yuan Xing Chang 4,700 dan. Purchases included He Yu 1,200 dan, Yu Da 1,700 dan, Yuan Da 3,000 dan, Rui Da 6,700 dan, Chang Feng 1,000 dan, Run Geng 2,600 dan, Xie Cheng 4,800 dan, Da Fu 1,100 dan, and Chang He 2,000 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>

<p>Yao Tong Cotton Arrivals Exceed 4,000 Bales</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is still good, and factory demand is slightly active. Sources say that Yao cotton totaled 2,168 bales and Tong cotton totaled 2,018 bales.</p>
<p>Huoji Cotton 37.00 Xin Yu Factory imported 1,000 bales Spot goods en route to the factory</p>

<p>Huoji Cotton 36.75 Dong Mian Company imported 500 bales Mostly arrived</p>
<h3>American Cotton Farmers Still Hedging</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened. Due to positive news from Liverpool, domestic and foreign merchants bought in, and the market was active. All months rose by two to six points. Later, cotton farmers hedged, and local firms sold off. The wheat market was weak, and the weather was good, causing market prices to fall back. External demand was sluggish. Although domestic firms were waiting for the Supreme Court's decision on the constitutionality of procedural taxes, they still placed limit orders to buy during the price decline. Spot demand was active, and the closing was sluggish. Spot prices remained unchanged, while futures fell by one to six points. English cotton spot prices rose by two points, and futures rose by 2-3 points. Indian cotton futures traders bought, and European exporters sold. Pingguoer rose by 1.5 rupees, Aomula rose by 2.25 rupees, and Bailuoxi rose by 2.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left. (Telegraph of the 14th)</p>

<h3>Grains: Flour Futures Rise Three Fen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed a phenomenon of an initial decline followed by a sharp rise. Prices for foreign wheat were quoted, with Chicago down by six to seven jiao and Canada down by two to three jiao. Market sentiment initially led to a one-fen drop in the opening prices for all months due to the significant decline in foreign wheat. However, as short positions were limited and factories adopted a wait-and-see approach, trading was sparse, but the market turned slightly better, improving by one fen compared to the initial opening. During the afternoon opening, prices for all months rose sharply, as spot wheat prices were expensive and rumors of inflation were rampant. Moreover, buyers ultimately realized that foreign wheat could not be ordered and domestic wheat had already been ordered, which was bound to lead to hoarding and price increases. Therefore, although actual sales were not brisk, the standard was easily bullish, with all months rising by over three fen. The fact that flour prices rose despite the decline in foreign wheat seemed to reflect concerns about supply and demand.</p>
<h3>Spot Prices High, Wheat Futures Rise Seven to Eight Fen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the opening of the wheat futures market saw relatively stable prices for all months. Although foreign wheat prices had fallen, spot wheat supplies were scarce, and customers were hoarding significantly, with those holding goods gradually increasing prices and those without goods maintaining standards. Consequently, trading was minimal, but prices improved by one to two fen. During the afternoon opening, spot wheat prices had reached 4.5 jiao, coupled with rumors of inflation, causing the market to gradually rise sharply. Near-term months were relatively looser due to demand. Currently, flour sales cannot be considered brisk, but wheat supplies are dwindling, making market sentiment easily agitated. No transactions were seen in the spot market in the north, while prices in the south had reached 4.5 jiao, but factories had not yet acquired supplies.</p>
<h3>New Early Rice Prices are Good at Jiao Xu</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Arrived on the 25th and 26th (a total of over 5,000 dan). After the heavy rain the night before, yesterday, market sentiment stabilized, and the local sales market was active. Thick early rice prices rose by over 1 jiao. Only over one hundred bags of thin early rice were sold, with a few fen increase. New thin rice bags with Xiu Yao and Bai Ge branding, etc., were all sold for 100 to 200 bags. The price of thick new early rice was similar. Du Yang and other colors of new top-grade rice all rose by a few fen to over 1 jiao. Yin Xi remained flat.</p>
<p>Date 14th Date 15th Change</p>
<p>Tongli New Early Rice 9.70 9.80 Up 1 jiao</p>
<p>Su Tong Sheep-tipped Rice 9.05 9.15 Up 1 jiao</p>
<p>Su Tong Reed-tipped Rice 9.05 9.10 Up 5 fen</p>
<p>Qingjiao Yao-seeded Rice 9.53 9.60 Up 7 fen</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) More than 40 stores had source deliveries. Various types of rice in the market, new early rice started off tight in the morning, but the market softened due to other factors. The prices of new white early rice and Du pointed rice were fixed. New sheep pier pointed rice continued to arrive, and retail sales remained good, with prices increasing by a few fen. Top-grade rice was firm, Bai Yuan was weak by a few fen, and thin early rice was weak by over 1 jiao. Other goods remained stable.</p>

<p>Free Discussion</p>
<h3>On Civilization</h3>
<p>— He Jin</p>
<p>In an article discussing gender issues, Akamatsu Meiko, after clarifying the freedom and equality of the union between the sexes in primitive times, went on to make the following statement:</p>
<p>"Descending into the age of civilization... the so-called relationship between the sexes completely fell into the relationship of the dominating man to the enslaved woman, the dominated. There is no human relationship at all in between."</p>
<p>Because the original author was discussing gender issues, the elucidation of the so-called "civilization" was limited to the scope of gender issues. Therefore, they still showed some consideration for the word "civilization" that we all use in speech, in writing, and especially as decoration for special tools. However, for us, this statement is already very useful: "Descending into the age of civilization... there is no human relationship at all in between!"</p>
<p>The word "civilization" became fashionable in China, which, from our generation's perspective, does not seem too long ago. After the abolition of the imperial examination, students in the "new schools," even though their queues were still long, liked to write things like "In today's civilized world..." in their essays. In the West, "civilization" is treated as a family heirloom of mankind, used to casually do some "great cause". Even now, aren't there still many people who, on the one hand, shout about civilization, and on the other hand, ride on others, or even act as "stable boys" yelling until they are busy? However, those people would never say, "And when it came to the age of civilization, human relationships ceased to exist at all." They would certainly say, "The current era is becoming more and more civilized, so civilized people must educate barbarians."</p>
<p>But what exactly is this method of "education"? Sinclair Lewis wrote the following in his novel "Ann Vickers":</p>
<p>"Bang, bang, bang!" He (referring to Columbus - author's note) knocked them down (referring to the Red Indians of America - author's note) to introduce European culture to primitive America."</p>
<p>And so on.</p>
<p>This "education" method is of course extremely clever. The word "civilization" has thus become the most useful thing for the "teachers" who want to educate those "barbarians"—but the effectiveness of this "use" is not necessarily so great, because even if the minds of those "savages" are simple, they see that "the bomb falls, and those who die under it are not the "civilized" people themselves—which is certainly admirable—but when they look downward," those who die are all women and children; when they look upward, they find "civilized" people enjoying themselves in the clouds, they will be stunned, and even become "more and more confused"! They did not see the so-called "civilization," they only saw: "There is no human relationship at all in between."</p>
<p>In fact, this method of civilized education is not a new invention; on the contrary, it is simply a "reduced by 80%" reprint of an ancient book.</p>
<p>Then is "civilization" really such an undesirable thing? Actually, there is no need to say that. If we compare "civilization" to coins (how "mercenary" the comparison is!), then we can say that the coins currently circulating in the market are all "copper foreign coins" privately manufactured by a group of bored rogues for the sake of profit. Of course, there are good foreign coins. We don't have to reject even good foreign coins because of the fraudulent "copper foreign coins". The current method is to learn from the owners of "cigarette paper shops" and "exchange shops," and use nails to pierce a two-sided hole in the "copper foreign coins" that can be seen in the market! This indicates that they will not be used in the future and that they are fraudulent things (which, of course, makes those who manufacture counterfeit coins very unhappy). On the other hand, we should try our best to find real good foreign coins. However, the production of good foreign coins is not easy, not only because it requires a lot of hard work, but most importantly, it also requires the selflessness and sincerity of a good technician and inspector who can formulate the composition.</p>
<h3>My View on the May Fourth Movement</h3>
<p>— Shi Yin</p>
<p>A few days ago, Mr. Cao Juren published an article on the mold of the May Fourth Movement, concluding that we should value the historical significance of the May Fourth Movement and not value the heroes created by the circumstances who are covered in mold. Subsequently, Yang Zao wrote a long article on the actual situation of the May Fourth Movement, mainly to show the purity of the central figures of the movement at that time, which differed slightly from Mr. Cao's intent. In my opinion, we have no objection to Mr. Cao's emphasis on the entire theory of the May Fourth Movement. However, the licentiousness and depravity of the central figures of the movement at that time, as well as the tricks of selling out and seeking refuge, were already revealed, which is also undeniable. However, how could such a strange phenomenon arise from a shocking movement by noble and pure students? Mr. Cao has not yet explained this, and now I will briefly write down my opinions below:</p>
<p>In general, historical evolution follows the stages of social change. The occurrence of a major historical event, or the rise or fall of a class, is closely related to the culture, economy, politics, and the strength of the country at that time, as well as the bullying of foreign races. On the surface, it is controlled by a few people, but in reality, it is needed by the majority. In other words, it is produced to adapt to the times. The epoch-making May Fourth Movement is, of course, no exception. Who were the people who made the May Fourth Movement? They were students, that is, the intellectual class, that is, the class of so-called scholars in our country throughout the ages. Since the early establishment of the dynasty, scholars have occupied a superior position. Those above scholars are called grand masters, then princes and sons of heaven, and the lowest are common people. The Book of Rites says: "Rites do not go down to common people, and punishments do not go up to grand masters." Even the temples for worshiping ancestors have levels. The Book of Rites also says; The Son of Heaven has seven, the princes have five, and the grand masters have three. The scholars have one, and the common people have no temple and worship in the bedroom. Roughly speaking, scholars and above in ancient times were rulers, and common people and below were ruled. The Tang Dynasty attached the greatest importance to jinshi. At that time, the jinshi who passed the examination looked down on the yellow official. The jinshi who failed the examination could still greet the Pu Hua chief on an equal footing. (Duanyan Wenjianlu) Xue Chao had already become prime minister. Still hating not being born as a jinshi. (See Zhuyan) The jiansheng of the early Ming Dynasty could, by order of the emperor, organize land taxes and build water conservancy. (See Nanyong Zhi) Even in the remote prefectures and counties during the Qing Dynasty, talented scholars could handle litigation and enter and exit public offices. Therefore, there was a common saying at that time that there were juren grand secretaries and talented scholars and Shangshu. As for the state throughout the ages, it seems that laws are not laws, which has cultivated a kind of licentious and depraved habit among scholars, which is even more shocking. The newly appointed jinshi of the Tang Dynasty used red paper names to visit Chang'an You Pingkangfang. (This Fang is inhabited by prostitutes. See Kaiyuan Anecdotes) During the Song Dynasty, all official banquets and three school gatherings in the official government were…all prostitutes dispatched by the official to serve directly. (See Menglianglu) Wulin's old affairs describe the prostitutes of the official wine cellar, saying: "Famous prostitutes are all hidden deep in tall buildings and are not easy to call upon. …They are often occupied by people in the study, and others cannot easily climb up." It was the country that openly allowed scholars to prostitute, and scholars had the exclusive privilege to occupy noble prostitutes. Qing law officials were guilty of prostituting, and the capital was even more strictly prohibited. If caught by the patrolling censor, they would be punished with a cane, but the new Jinshi of the Qing Dynasty were the exception. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, students from Beijing Normal University wandered around the male hall (i.e., male prostitutes) outside the south city at night. When it was late at night, they could call for the city gate to be opened to return to school. These are all simple examples. Therefore, the superior status of the scholar class has not changed at all from the early days of feudal society to the end of the disguised feudal society. As for the policy of despising industry and commerce, it has been passed down in our country since ancient times. As early as the Han Dynasty, there were systems in place that forbade merchants to ride in carriages and wear silk. During the Jin Dynasty, merchants used white scarves on their foreheads to write what they were selling and their names. One foot wore white shoes and one foot wore yellow shoes. (See the note on the word merchant in Guangyun) Look at this kind of dress, isn't it more ugly than the clowns who insert jokes and make fun on the stage now. If the clothing is like this, other treatments can be inferred. However, since the Opium War (1542), although our country is still a disguised feudal society, Western imperialism has been surging eastward. Affected by it domestically, the bourgeoisie suddenly picked up. Those who have always despised him now fear that they will not be able to attach themselves to him. As for the class of seven, under this influence, they have been unable to cope with the new environment, and their former prestige will be lost. If they do not depend on the powerful, they will not be able to maintain their lives. This is just as sociologists tell us: the ruler of the political power in each era is the economically superior class in each era. At the end of the Middle Ages, capitalism was completed, and political sovereignty was exclusively occupied by the bourgeoisie and the unproductive laborers (i.e., the intellectual class) raised by them. In a certain period, unproductive laborers receive generous incomes and must be loyal to the ruling class politically. For example, monks in the Middle Ages were necessary figures to suppress and regulate the serf society in order to protect feudal property. And into capitalist society. As the monks were no longer the key to protecting capitalist property, his status and the feudal system were destroyed together. From this, employee · official · lawyer · journalist · doctor of capitalist countries. The groups or political parties organized by writers are rising instead.</p>
<p>The central figures of the May Fourth Movement were college students, that is, the intellectual class, that is, unproductive laborers, that is, the class of scholars in our country. They were born in an era of bourgeois prosperity, and Western culture and economy swept in. The old traditional ideas and the old social organizations have all been fundamentally shaken. Seeing that their class is approaching the end of its rope, they will collapse if they do not find a way to transform the situation. One or two heroic figures, on the one hand, need to satisfy their own desire for leadership, and on the other hand, want to maintain the past glory of their class. They seize a good topic and take an unprecedented action. So a few student representatives were born in response to the times, selling the storm and rain. On the surface, they are upright and upright, but in fact, the general skills of bureaucrats and politicians have been 『tested concretely and subtly. "The so-called" planting parties to disturb the government; the power to knock on the door and degrade; accepting bribes and slandering the court; setting up a bureau to cheat and threaten the people" (Mr. Cao quoted Qi Dong Yeyu) The old tricks of the college students in the Southern Song Dynasty were mostly reenacted as facts during the May Fourth period. In this way, the personal goals of several student representatives have already been achieved, and they have won the cheers of the people and the applause of the entire class, so the "heroes created by the times" have been realized. As for sitting in a private car, eating in a restaurant, and playing with beauties, it is a necessary act in the process of selling oneself to a political campaign, and it is also a bad habit indulged in by past scholars, which is no longer a problem.</p>
<p>In short, the May Fourth Movement was epoch-making, on the one hand, it ended the old situation of the college students in the Southern Song Dynasty and the past scholar class (the affairs of the college students in the Southern Song Dynasty are detailed in Zhou Mi Guixin Zazhi and Qi Dong Yeyu, which are very similar to the May Fourth Movement, which will not be described in detail here). On the other hand, the two sides created a new era for the new intellectual class. Sixteen or seventeen years have passed since the May Fourth Movement. In these sixteen or seventeen years, the phenomena that have occurred inside and outside the country's schools, as well as all the light and land activities, whether they were spread by the "May Fourth mold", are facts that everyone has seen and heard, and we don't need to argue. In short, "Don't despise the epoch-making significance of the May Fourth Movement. Don't value the nine heroes created by the times." Mr. Cao's kind of words are what we extremely agree with!</p>
<h3>Honorable Old Woman (8)</h3>
<p>— By Ema Shū, Translated by Ren Jun</p>
<p>Ringo felt as if she was about to cry out. However, a few minutes later, while she was working, she turned gloomy and pensive again, and then she began to chant Buddhist scriptures. She was still wholeheartedly entangled with the gods and Buddhas.</p>
<p>One evening in September, Old Woman Fan had completely cleaned the workers' dormitory, so she returned to her own home a little earlier than usual.</p>
<p>"Well, let me go home now to give my husband food and wipe his body. Such an old woman still has a good person waiting for her at home, haha. Please rest in peace!"</p>
<p>Later, not even an hour had passed when a burst of laughter and shouts, which were completely unexpected, came from the old woman in front of my house.</p>
<p>"Haha, honor, honor! Where is there a more glorious honor than this! Long live, long live!"</p>
<p>At this time, my mother, who was talking to us by the stove, unknowingly frowned and said:</p>
<p>"Oh, what is that old woman stirring up now? Is she crazy, or is she drunk?"</p>
<p>"Madam!" The old woman rushed in aggressively, shouting. "Please listen to me. My son has died in battle! An honorable death in battle! Isn't that wonderful? Eh?"</p>
<p>Her face was covered with tears, and her eyes were shining strangely. And she was also opening her toothless mouth to laugh. Her expression was truly miserable.</p>
<p>"Oh, your son has finally died in battle!" My mother's tears flowed down without her realizing it.</p>
<p>"Madam, why are you crying?" She sat in the doorway, laughing, and said, "There is nothing to cry about. As everyone says, this is for the country, this is an honorable death in battle. After all, my son is still wonderful. I'm really happy, so happy I can't stand it. So I've just been laughing from the beginning. Hahaha..."</p>
<p>She laughed even more hysterically.</p>
<p>According to the old woman, when she had just returned home, the people in the neighborhood had gathered there. They told her that before she had returned, the yamen had already sent notice that her son had died bravely in battle. They also used various words to comfort her.</p>
<h3>Singapore Harbor, Part 2</h3>
<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>"What are they doing? Rice… the red-haired devils are throwing silver coins, and the Malay ghosts are snatching them up!"</p>
<p>The pockmarked young man joked:</p>
<p>"Old man, why don't you go grab some? Send your two little devils!"</p>
<p>The old man saw a good number of silver coins being thrown into the sea from the first and second class area and sarcastically said to the pockmarked young man:</p>
<p>"You miser, are you like them? ... Look how generous they are!"</p>
<p>"Bah, is that generous? … They just have some ill-gotten gains and are looking for amusement!"</p>
<p>The pockmarked young man wiped the sweat from his face with his hand and heavily slapped the ship's railing, looking serious and earnest.</p>
<p>"Oh, they threw down a silver dollar!"</p>
<p>Several people nearby seemed surprised and envious, and they all shouted.</p>
<p>The old man seemed to instantly lose his humorous mood, adopting a solemn expression, and muttered to himself through clenched teeth:</p>
<p>"Humph, these things! …"</p>
<p>But from the first and second class area came the sound,</p>
<p>"Very good!"</p>
<p>On the sea surface, a dripping head and an arm holding a silver dollar emerged.</p>
<p>At the same time, on the deck, a voice mixed with phlegm roared out from the crowd.</p>
<p>"Good!"</p>
<p>The pockmarked young man turned around and saw that the owner of this voice was the middle-aged, fat merchant who had just returned from the pier. Standing beside him was the young man who often quoted poetry, who, with an expression of envy for the Malays, shook his head and said in a sighing tone:</p>
<p>"Alas, who says 'diligence is useful, play is useless'?"</p>
<p>The middle-aged, fat merchant was probably deeply moved by this game. He quickly wiped his face with a handkerchief, then reached into his pocket, took out a copper coin, and threw it towards a Malay man in a nearby rowboat. The Malay man quickly glanced at the thrown object, as if he immediately understood it was a copper coin. He turned his face away and shook his hand dismissively, then rowed away.</p>
<p>"Damn it! Isn't that money?"</p>
<p>The middle-aged, fat merchant said, his face turning red and displeased.</p>
<p>"People, they only want silver ones, bright and shiny ones are what they respect!"</p>
<p>Someone in the crowd said mockingly.</p>
<p>The pockmarked young man laughed heartily, feeling pleased.</p>
<p>The middle-aged, fat merchant, seeming unconvinced, lowered his sweat-covered forehead and desperately searched his pockets.</p>
<p>The pockmarked young man deliberately shouted loudly at the Malay men on the sea:</p>
<p>"Black devils, don't look down on people, we'll throw silver coins . . . "</p>
<p>The middle-aged, fat merchant unbuttoned his clothes, looked into his pockets while pulling at the edges, and said anxiously and irritably:</p>
<p>"Damn! Where did it go? Just now it was still … "</p>
<p>The poetry-loving young man stood beside him, pretending to help him search, and asked:</p>
<p>"What are you looking for?"</p>
<p>"That… that… fake coin!"</p>
<p>"Hey, didn't you just use it to buy cigarettes?" Suddenly, cheers erupted from that side, and everyone immediately turned their heads to look. The middle-aged, fat merchant took the opportunity to slip into the cabin.</p>

<h3>National Games Day Six: Shanghai Wins Three Track and Field Championships; Eleven New National Records Set in Six Days; Men's Decathlon and Men's and Women's Swimming Start Today; Men's Tennis and Basketball Schedules Tightest Today</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the sixth day of the National Games. The men's and women's track and field events have all concluded. The Shanghai team, with a great victory, won the men's field, men's track, and women's track and field championships. Yesterday, three new national records were set in the men's 400 meters and women's 200 meters and softball throw. In the past six days, a total of eleven new records have been set. In the women's 400-meter relay, the Shanghai team was disqualified due to a foul, which is a pity. The men's decathlon and men's and women's swimming will all begin today. Swimming is sure to cause a sensation due to the appearance of Yang Xiuqiong. Among the ball games, men's basketball and men's tennis are the tightest today. The men's doubles will hold the quarterfinals, and the men's singles will hold the semifinals. All the experts are out, and the gains and losses are extremely important. A full stadium is to be expected.</p>
<h3>Women's 400-Meter Relay Final: Shanghai Team Disqualified; Wang Kai's Photo Proves Wrong Lane; Zhang Boling's Investigation Confirms Evidence; National Record Set Was Cancelled; Guangdong Team Takes Championship</h3>
<p>In the women's 400-meter relay final, a total of six teams participated. Although the Shanghai team took first place with a score of 54.5 seconds, unfortunately, the fourth runner, Li Sen, ran in the wrong lane. The Eastern Team, which came in second, protested verbally. After an investigation by Zhang Boling, chairman of the judging committee, the evidence was confirmed, with a clear photo taken by Wang Kai as proof. Therefore, Zhang has decided to cancel the Shanghai team's first-place qualification, and the second-place Guangdong team will be promoted. The following will be promoted in order. Because there were only six teams, the sixth place is vacant. The determined rankings are as follows:</p>
<h3>Overall Championship Scores</h3>
<p>Men's</p>
<p>Shanghai 8 points Liaoning 4 points</p>
<p>Malaysia 3 points Beiping 2 points</p>
<p>Shanxi 2 points Nanjing 1 point</p>
<p>Women's</p>
<p>Shanghai 4 points Malaysia 3 points</p>
<p>Guangdong 2 points Fujian 1 point</p>
<p>Circumstances of the Final</p>
<p>The final was held at 2:00 PM. Qian Hangsu of Shanghai ran the first leg, Jiao Yulian the second, Peng Aipu the third, and Li Sen the fourth. The Shanghai team took the lead all the way, leaving Guangdong behind by about five or six meters. However, when the third and fourth runners handed off the baton, Peng and Li did not handle the baton well. Zhao Yunshan of Guangdong emerged, and Li Sen chased after her, winning over the Guangdong team by a shoulder. The score was 54.5 seconds, breaking the national record. Guangdong was first, Malaysia third, and Qing and Min were second.</p>
<p>Guangdong Team Protests</p>
<p>Immediately after the final, the Guangdong team suddenly discovered that Shanghai's last runner ran in the wrong lane. They quickly protested verbally to Zhang Boling, chairman of the judging committee, saying that someone had seen it, but there was only testimonial evidence, not physical evidence, so they could not speak credulously. They proposed that the photos taken by Wang Kai be examined.</p>
<p>Photo as Evidence</p>
<p>Fortunately, Wang Kai had taken photos at both the starting and ending points, which were exceptionally clear. It was discovered that in the photos taken by Wang Kai, Qian Hangsu, the first runner of Shanghai, was in the fifth lane, while Li Sen, at the ending point, was in the sixth lane. Therefore, Shanghai's foul was extremely obvious, and the evidence was confirmed. The photos on the competition results are sufficient for reference. From this, it can be seen.</p>
<p>Disqualification Decided</p>
<p>Therefore, after Zhang Boling examined the two photos, he believed that Shanghai had indeed fouled. The Guangdong team's protest did not require convening a meeting, and it was decided to directly cancel the Shanghai team's qualification. An official announcement will be published today. According to general speculation, the Shanghai team's third and fourth legs did not hand off the baton well, so it was during this period that Li Sen ran in the wrong lane. The pre-race inspection report stated that there was no error in the lines where each person was standing. The last runner of Beiping also discovered that Li Sen was in front of him, obstructing his path. Therefore, Shanghai's foul is clear. The results were still good, and it is a pity to cancel them.</p>

<h3>Women's 200 Meter Final: Li Sen Breaks Record Again</h3>
<p>Result: 27.5 Seconds</p>
<p>Shanghai Takes Top Three Places</p>
<p>There were eight people who qualified for the women's 200-meter final, which started at 2:00 PM yesterday. The sky was high and the air was clear, perfect for the competition of heroines. At the sound of the starting gun, the eight heroines set off, each with a determination to win, hoping to have their names listed in the conference records. They formed a line, like watching the Qiantang tide, swift as lightning. Three yellow and one blue gradually took the lead. At 150 meters, the competition among the four was particularly fierce. However, Li Sen at this time exerted her strength and stood out, crossing the finish line with 27.5 seconds. The second, third, and fourth places were separated by half a shoulder. Shanghai monopolized the top three places. The winners are listed on the left:</p>

<h3>Dai Shuguo Overwhelms Fu Jincheng: New Record Set in 400 Meters</h3>
<p>Breaking the National Record Held for Seven Years</p>
<p>The men's 400-meter final was held at 2:10 PM on the 15th. The participants had less than twenty minutes to rest after the semi-finals. Everyone expected that Fu Jincheng and Dai Shuguo would fight a bloody battle, especially Fu, who had the highest chance of winning a championship. Eight people participated in the final. Fu was in the outermost circle, and Dai was in the innermost circle. After the starting gun, Fu and Dai immediately strode forward. Before 100 meters, they were already at the front. Dai was depressed in the semi-finals. At this time, he was determined to win, his steps were wide and light. When he was about 300 meters away, he was about one meter ahead of Fu, gritted his teeth and sprinted straight. Fu also swore to fight with all his strength, not letting go. At 350 meters, he was about to catch up, but Dai worked even harder to sprint. Fu could not catch up, and Dai finally defeated Fu Jincheng, who was frightening for a while, by about one meter, winning the championship with a result of 51.2 seconds, breaking the national record of 52.4 seconds held by Liu Changchun for seven years. After the report was heard throughout the venue, applause thundered. Li Yanxiang finished three meters behind Fu, taking third place. In this event, Shanghai got 7 points, Malaysia 5 points, Jiangsu 4 points, Liaoning 3 points, and Guangdong 3 points. After the competition, Wu Xingya gave the awards.</p>
<p>First Place Dai Shuguo (Shanghai)</p>
<p>Second Place Fu Jincheng (Malaysia)</p>
<p>Third Place Li Yanxiang (Jiangsu)</p>
<p>Fourth Place Jin Changxian (Liaoning)</p>
<p>Fifth Place Liang Yunming (Guangdong)</p>
<p>Sixth Place Deng Minsheng (Guangdong)</p>
<p>Result: 52.2 Seconds, Breaking the National Record</p>
<p>The first track and field event on the sixth day was the men's 400-meter semi-final, divided into two groups, with the top four in each group advancing. Dong Duzhao temporarily gave up, reducing the interest in competition. Fu Jincheng and Dai Shuguo were in the same group, and they competed fiercely. Fu won by two meters, with results close to the national record. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>First Group (1) Jin Changxian (Liaoning) (2) Liang Minsheng (Guangdong) (3) Dai Zongzhuang (Malaysia) (4) Chen Futian (Guangdong) 54.7 seconds</p>
<p>Second Group (1) Fu Jincheng (Malaysia) (2) Dai Shuguo (Shanghai) (3) Li Yanxiang (Jiangsu) (4) Liang Yunming (Guangdong) 52.6 seconds</p>
<h3>Triple Jump Final: Zhang Jiayi Exceeds 14-Meter Mark</h3>
<p>Second place Yang Daogui, third place Wang Shilin</p>
<p>In our country, among triple jumpers, only Situ Guang, Yang Daogui, and Wang Shilin have jumped over 14 meters in the past. In yesterday's triple jump final, Zhang Jiayi won the championship with 14.125 meters, overwhelming the mediocre Wang Shilin and Yang Daogui of Nanjing. Zhang's previous highest record was 13.90 meters. Yesterday, during the trial jump, Zhang got 13.96 meters on the second jump, and 14.125 meters on the third jump. The subsequent three jumps were either fouls or showed no improvement. The runner-up, Yang Daogui, got 13.22 meters on the first jump, but there was no improvement in each subsequent jump. Wang Shilin of Beiping, due to recent illnesses, only jumped over 13.12 meters. The full results are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) Zhang Jiayi (Shanghai) 14.125 meters</p>
<p>(2) Yang Daogui (Nanjing) 13.22 meters</p>

<h3>10,000 Meter Final: Gu Desheng Wins with Constant Strength</h3>
<p>Sets New Record for the Games at 34 Minutes, 11.6 Seconds</p>
<p>Excellent Time Distribution Per Lap is Worth Emulating</p>
<p>The 10,000-meter race was one of the last track and field events of the Games. Participants included Shanxi's Gu Desheng, Li Denggui, Wang Huibin, Chen Shusen, and Shanghai's Wang Zhenglin, Jiangsu's Jin Zhongkang and other athletes. Most of the participants feared the reputation of Shanxi and did not dare to compete. Therefore, many temporarily withdrew. Only more than 30 people actually participated in the competition. Among them, the four bald heads of Shanxi were the most noticed by the audience. In addition, the announcer reported that "Number 205, Gu Desheng, has hope of winning,"</p>
<p>Zhang Liang's Strategy: Shanghai's Wang Leads First</p>
<p>Before the game, Shanghai's Wang Zhenglin and Zhang Liang secretly discussed a plan to challenge the tiger on the mountain. At the start, Zhang Liang would run fast, leading the Shanxi generals to follow, so that the Shanxi generals would be exhausted, and then Zhang Liang would give up, and Wang Zhenglin would take the opportunity to defeat the Shanxi athletes. After the start, Zhang Liang ran hard, but the Shanxi generals were experienced and were not moved. Zhang gave up and stopped running at 2,300 meters. In the first lap, Gu Desheng was in sixth place. In the second lap, Zhang Liang was in first place, Jin Zhongkang was in second place, and Gu Desheng was in fourth place. At 1,500 meters, Zhang Liang finished first, with a result of 4 minutes and 48 seconds.</p>
<p>3,000 Meters: New Record</p>
<p>At 3,000 meters, Gu and Wang competed fiercely. Wang Zhenglin's result was 9 minutes and 55 seconds, and Gu Desheng's result was 9 minutes and 55.4 seconds, both breaking the national record (the national 3,000-meter record is 10 minutes and 5 seconds). In the eighth lap, Li Denggui was in first place, Wang Huibin was in second place, Gu Desheng was in third place, and Huang Ruiwen of Guangxi was in fourth place. In the ninth lap, Gu Desheng jumped to lead the pack, and Wang Zhenglin also bravely surpassed Li Denggui. At this time, Jin Zhongkang was in sixth place, Niu Hongling of Shandong was in seventh place, Chen Shusen of Shanxi was in ninth place, and He Baoshan of Jiangsu was in seventh place.</p>
<p>5,000 Meters: Amazing Result</p>
<p>At 5,000 meters, Gu Desheng broke the national 5,000-meter record with 16 minutes and 53 seconds. Wang Zhenglin followed with 16 minutes and 56 seconds, also breaking the national record. From the ninth lap to the twentieth lap, Gu Desheng took the lead all the way, as if in no man's land, while Wang Zhenglin and Li Denggui competed fiercely behind him. In the sixteenth lap, Wang won over Li by about four meters.</p>
<p>Swift as a Swallow: Straight to the Finish Line</p>
<p>At 9,000 meters, Gu Desheng's stride suddenly became larger, swift as a swallow, and the others could not reach him. At this time, Gu was 80 meters away from the second place and three and a half laps ahead of the last person. Gu finished 9,500 meters in 32 minutes and 40 seconds. In the last lap, Gu's pace was even stronger, rushing straight to the finish line with a result of 34 minutes and 11.6 seconds, breaking the Games record, but it was a pity that he failed to break the national record. The second Wang Zhilin and the third Wang Huibin competed fiercely. Wang Zhenglin narrowly took the second place, and Li Denggui retreated to fourth place. Huang Ruiwen of Guangxi, a famous general, had broken the national record in Guangxi, and also won fifth place this time. Zhongkang, who is old and strong, won sixth place and deserves praise. He Baoshan was eliminated from the list in seventh place.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong, Guangdong, and Malaya Form a Triumvirate; Swimming Begins Competition Today</h3>
<p>The Unexpected Rise of Guangxi Province's Athletes Should Not Be Overlooked</p>
<p>Yang Anni, Future Mermaid, Will Dominate All</p>
<p>The Men's and Women's Swimming Championships will begin this afternoon at the swimming pool. Participants include nineteen units for men, namely Lu, Fei, Qing, Jiangxi, Hebei, Zhejiang, Wei, Beijing, Guangxi, Fujian, Jiangsu, Ping, Anhui, Xinjiang, Hai, Hong Kong, Guangdong, Malaya, and Shanghai; and only seven units for women, namely Beijing, Guangxi, Fujian, Hong Kong, Guangdong, Malaya, and Shanghai. The schedule for the first day includes five heats and three semi-finals. The events are the men's and women's 50-meter freestyle heats and semi-finals, the men's 100-meter freestyle heat, the women's 100-meter backstroke heat, and the men's 200-meter breaststroke heat and semi-finals. The strength of each unit in this competition is exceptionally strong, especially Hong Kong, Guangdong, Malaya, and Shanghai. Although the details of the rising force from Guangxi Province are not yet known, based on observations during practice in the city pool in recent days, it may be difficult to win the championship, but one or two dark horses may emerge in various events. As for the championship issue, this year, both men and women will be in a three-way contest between Hong Kong, Guangdong, and Malaya. Although Shanghai has many famous athletes, there is no hope of winning the championship. The situation is even worse for women in Shanghai. He Wenjin was pulled to Beijing City. Furthermore, Chen Baoxuan, Zhou Xiuzhen, and others would be satisfied with just getting a place. Last year, the men's swimming championship was won by Guangdong, and the women's by Hong Kong. Let's see what happens this year. Since Yang Anni from Malaya did not come, the mermaid will dominate all the individual championships for men and women, except for the relays, there are ten events in total, and nine of them have already been taken by Hong Kong. However, many fierce players from Hong Kong, such as Guo Zhenheng, have switched to the Guangdong Province banner, carrying out a defection. Moreover, Hao Zhu, Liu Baoxi, has not yet arrived, and it is unknown if he can make it in time, which is a real problem.</p>

<p>Men's Tennis</p>
<h3>Singles Semi-Finals Today Xu Chengji Faces Wang Wenzheng Lin Baohua Meets Lin Wangsu Doubles Semi-Finals Also Held Consecutively Today</h3>
<p>Men's tennis is at a crucial stage today, with the outcomes related to the championship. Starting at 1:00 PM, there will be four singles semi-final matches, and starting at 3:00 PM, there will be two doubles semi-final matches, all best of five sets. The singles match between Xu Chengji and Wang Wenzheng, and Lin Baohua against Lin Wangsu, as well as the doubles match between Lin Qiu and Malaya's Lin Wangsu and Ruan Guoying, are particularly exciting. All are first-class national players, and the competition will be intense due to the evenly matched strengths of each group. This is a rare opportunity to witness a dragon-tiger battle, a grand occasion like never before. The tennis courts today will definitely be crowded.</p>
<h3>Beiping Athletes Are Formidable Youngsters Malaya Almost Suffered a Mishap Wangsu and Qi'an Both Escaped from the Jaws of Death Java's Two Players Won Without Effort</h3>
<p>Four men's tennis matches were held yesterday, all three-set matches. The players who qualified for the semi-finals are Java's Xu Chengji, Zeng Duancai, Malaya's Lin Wangsu, and Chen Qi'an, who will compete with Shanghai and Sichuan today for the semi-final spots. Yesterday, Xu Chengji and Zeng Duancai's victories were without a doubt. Lin Wangsu against Xie Hua and Chen Qi'an against Wen Yawen were almost upsets. Each of them secured their final victory in extremely difficult and arduous situations, which can be considered perilous. A detailed account of the battles is provided below.</p>
<p>Xu Chengji Is Polite</p>
<p>Without Fully Displaying His Talents</p>
<p>National player Xu Chengji's tennis skills have reached the pinnacle, needless to say. He is very confident of winning the singles championship this time. Yesterday, he met Hebei's Zhang Xinhua, who was far from being his opponent. Xu gave it a small try, not fully displaying his talents, and casually playing made it difficult for Zhang to parry. After the start of the match, Xu went straight down, quickly taking five games. However, he did not demand too much, politely offering a game, ending the first set with 6-1. From the second set onwards, Xu still took the lead with four games, but because he was intentionally being polite, not wanting to embarrass the opponent, he gave away another big gift, eventually ending the match with 6-1.</p>
<p>Zeng Duancai Is Steady and Admirable</p>
<p>Winning Two Sets Consecutively</p>
<p>Java's Zeng Duancai's tennis skills are just so-so, but he is steady and admirable. Jiangsu's Xu Cida is an unknown and lacks both talent and knowledge. Although he struggled once yesterday, he eventually failed. At the start of the war, Xu immediately took the offensive, winning a game. Zeng won two consecutive games, leading 2-1. Xu made 60 moves each time, Zeng added four games, and then won the first set 6-2. In the renewed battle, Xu carefully fought back, trying his best to resist, and got two games. Unexpectedly, he then fell into a slump and was repeatedly scored on by Zeng, leading remotely with 5-2. Although he pulled back a game later, it was of no help to the overall situation, ending with 6-3.</p>
<p>Lin Wangsu Escaped from the Jaws of Death</p>
<p>Becoming Famous Overnight</p>
<p>Left-arm General Lin Wangsu was well-known and invincible two years ago. His tennis skills have not improved in recent days. Beiping's Xie Hua is not well-known, but his skills are quite commendable. His forehand strokes are heavy and powerful, but his backhand lacks confidence, and his experience is also lacking. Otherwise, he could have defeated Wangsu yesterday and ascended to glory in one step. But the result of yesterday's battle surprised the audience, and Wangsu was also very frightened. As soon as the bell rang, the war broke out. Xie was not Wang's opponent, but he was unwilling to succumb to the powerful enemy, so he resisted desperately, running tirelessly. In the end, he was slightly weaker and lost the first set 2-6. In the second set, Xie was extra careful, sweeping left and right, using both strength and gentleness, and even won three consecutive games. Wangsu also had to sigh at the ball. Then Lin got the service game, and Xie steadily and softly drew the ball, sending it to the left, right, front, and back continuously. Lin was exhausted and resigned. Xie won back a set with 6-1, tying the score.</p>
<p>Although Defeated, Still Glorious</p>
<p>The next set was a matter of life and death. During the preliminary competition, Xie had admitted that he was no match, but at this time, he had the hope of seeing the sun and overwhelming the strong enemy, which was his wish to become famous overnight. So he was ambitious and tried to expand his potential. Lin knew that the opponent was not weak, and he had received a lesson in the previous set, so he was extra careful and did not dare to panic. Otherwise, if he failed, not only would the championship prospects be greatly affected, but also his personal reputation would be swept away. With such psychology on both sides, the competition became even more intense. Lin served first and won, and Xie paid tribute in the same way and gave back even more. Lin also won two consecutive games, taking the lead with 3-2. In the next game, Xie served, remembering a 1-2 lag, followed by an out-of-bounds ball, and the referee mistakenly judged that Xie won, getting the game, and then getting two more games, Xie led with 5-3. Lin tried hard to catch up with a game, and fell behind with 4-5, Xie served in the next game, which was the key to victory or defeat. Unexpectedly, Xie was too eager to win, but he couldn't control himself, and his wild balls appeared repeatedly, resulting in a 5-5 tie. Lin served and won the first game, taking the lead with 6-5. Xie fought back carefully, playing to a 6-6 tie. At this time, Xie was extremely anxious, not as calm as in the second set, so there were occasional mistakes, giving the opponent a chance to attack. Although they played another 7-7 tie, the overall situation was gone, and there was nothing he could do. In the end, Wangsu won the final victory with 9-7.</p>
<p>Chen Qi'an Almost Suffered a Mishap</p>
<p>After Suffering Comes Happiness</p>
<p>Chen Qi'an is a famous player from Malaya. He almost failed in his battle against Beiping's Wen Yawen yesterday. At the beginning of the match, Wen used beautiful strokes, intercepting both sides, sometimes far, sometimes near, suddenly left, suddenly right, swinging the plague array. Little Chen had no way to go and lost five camps in a row. Although he pulled back a game later, he eventually lost the set 1-6. At the beginning of the second set, Qi'an found the way and won two consecutive games. The situation turned around, and General Wen was confident and didn't take it seriously. 3-2, 4-3, repeatedly taking the lead, Chen then followed closely, never leaving. The air was quite tense for a while. Then Chen desperately counterattacked, instead coming from behind with 5-4, 6-5. After a very long battle in the next game, they reached a 6-6 tie. At this time, General Wen broke out again, randomly scattering the plague sand. It really worked immediately, and he turned defeat into victory again with 7-6, 8-7. Although Little Chen suffered a small setback, he was unwilling to give up. He raised his arms and shouted, and pulled out three cities in a row, so the situation of one set each was barely created with 10-8. In the third set, both sides felt exhausted, but victory or defeat was at this critical moment, so they all fought to the death. Little Chen was particularly brave, 4-2, 5-3, leading all the way. Inadvertently, General Wen used his old trick, long strokes and short interceptions, attacking from left and right, and winning three consecutive games, taking the lead again with 6-5. Little Chen fought with his back to the city, sinking the boat, using all his strength, and adding three games, barely winning with 8-6.</p>
<p>Women's Tennis</p>
<h3>Doubles Semi-Finals Today Two Pairs of Sisters from Shanghai and Shanxi Have a Thrilling Battle</h3>
<p>Today there are only two women's tennis doubles semi-final matches, which are very important. The competition between Shanxi's Wang Chunqing and Wang Chunwei against Shanghai's Wei Zutong and Wei Maigu is expected to have a wonderful performance. The winner or loser is related to the championship. The winner of this match can win the championship. The other semi-final group, Malaya's Lu Suli and Xie Nili against Sichuan's Li Yuping and Zhao Yunhua, have average strengths and are no match for Shanghai and Shanxi.</p>
<h3>Singles Semi-Finals Wei Maigu Defeated Wang Chunwei in a Hard Fight</h3>
<p>The Third Set Had 20 Games Before the Winner Was Determined Wang Chunqing, Huang Shannong, and Chen Qing Won the Semi-Final Spots</p>
<p>The women's tennis singles semi-finals were held yesterday. Shanghai's Wei Maigu defeated Shanxi's Wang Chunwei's strong shots with tricky soft balls, winning 2-1 and winning the semi-final spot, which is a pleasing event. In the first set, Wei won 7-5. In the second set, Chunwei showed her great power, giving a shutout. In the third set, they fought hard to separate, and it was difficult to judge who was better, but Wei was always superior, and eventually came out on top with 11-9. The competition between Nanjing's Chen Qing and Beiping's Tang Mingzhen was the same, exactly the same. They also fought to the point of exhaustion. Chen Qing won the semi-final spot with 2-1. In the other two groups, Shanxi's Wang Chunqing and Nanjing's Huang Shannong all won without effort.</p>
<p>Huang Shannong</p>
<p>The match between Nanjing's Huang Shannong and Sichuan's Ye Yuru ended the earliest. Huang Shannong has short hair and shorts, just like a man, so she is agile and good at fighting. Ye Yuru is short and fat and not good at running. The strength of the two is very different. In the first set, Shannong won 6-1 very easily. There was a slight competition in the next set, 3-3, 4-4, Yuru followed closely, and eventually lost again with 4-6.</p>
<p>Wang Chunqing</p>
<p>Wang Chunqing, who is sure to win the women's singles championship, played against Guangdong's Yang Weibin yesterday. Wang also won 6-1, 6-4, but there was quite a bit of competition, and the performance was very good. Yang Weibin had previously defeated Shanghai's first singles player, Mao Yuwen. Her tennis skills are naturally extraordinary, steady and able to withstand battles, without any anger, and her shots and saves are clear and natural, so she was able to pose a great threat to Wang Chunwei in the second set, taking the lead with 3-1, which made the audience very excited, but the result was still inevitable elimination.</p>
<p>Women's 200-Meter Start (International and Wang Kai Photo)</p>
<p>Wei Zutong</p>
<p>Wei and Wang Chunwei have their own strengths, one soft and one hard. Initially, Miss Wei took the lead, and the situation was very good, but after 4-2, Wang chased to 4-4, and then to 5-5. Wei used high balls to embarrass the enemy, making Wang fall into the trap. Sure enough, she won two consecutive games and gained the upper hand. In the next set, Wang's technique was pure and skilled, with few suicides. Her sharp shots made it difficult for Wei to parry, and she won the shutout. In the third set, one game for you, one game for me, insisting to the end. Each won with the service game. Wei always led, while Wang followed the tie, each not relaxing. In the end, both were exhausted. Wei only used soft balls to return the tribute, while Wang shot hard. Wei had a chance to win the set five times, but she missed them all, which is a pity. Wang was eventually eliminated with 9-11 due to repeated suicides.</p>
<p>Chen Qing</p>
<p>The battle between Chen and Beiping's Tang Mingzhen was the same as the battle between Wei and Wang. They were the last group to end. One was agile and good at running, and the tennis skills were average. After each winning a set, the third set started at 3-3 and reached 6-6, going back and forth, each not giving way, fighting until they were sweating like rain and it was difficult to move. Tang won the service game again, taking the lead with 7-5. In the next game, Chen served, and Tang won three consecutive points. Winning this set was only one point away, thinking it was easily obtainable, but unexpectedly, she couldn't grab this most valuable point. So she first became discouraged, and instead lost with 7-9. It's a pity.</p>
<p>Women's Basketball</p>
<h3>Women's Basketball Second Round: Jiangsu Defeats Beiping; Shanghai, Guangdong, and Fujian All Advance to the Quarterfinals; The Superior Prevail and the Inferior are Eliminated: Zhejiang and Henan Lose</h3>
<p>Yesterday's basketball matches at the gymnasium were entirely the women's second round, with a total of four games. The fierce battlefield was replaced by the sounds of women's voices. The first match was Shanghai against Hebei. The Shanghai team, with its strong force, won easily. The second match was Guangdong against Zhejiang. Guangdong is also one of the strong teams, and it won against the West Lake team effortlessly. The match between Fujian and Henan was a clear mismatch in strength. The Fujian team had aspirations for the championship, while the Henan team, with its ordinary strength, could not resist. The last match was Jiangsu against Beiping. The women's basketball team of the old capital has always enjoyed a great reputation. It is a pity that former stars Huang Shushen, Sun Guiyun, and others have all retired. Although the new team is sharp, its experience is slightly lacking. Jiangsu narrowly won by two points. The Jiangsu team performed exceptionally well yesterday, especially forward Xu Biyun. Thus, these four teams—Shanghai, Fujian, Guangdong, and Jiangsu—all secured the right to advance to the quarterfinals. Jiangsu will play against Shanghai, and Guangdong will play against Fujian in the quarterfinals tomorrow afternoon at 2 and 3 o'clock respectively. Who will win is still uncertain. According to general observation, Shanghai and Fujian are considered to have a better chance. The results of yesterday's matches are as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai defeated Hebei 63-22</p>
<p>Fujian defeated Henan 54-13</p>
<p>Guangdong defeated Zhejiang 53-14</p>
<p>Jiangsu defeated Beiping 26-24</p>
<p>The Chen Family Generals of Shanghai Defeat Hebei</p>
<p>The match between Shanghai and Hebei was held at 10:00 AM yesterday. The Shanghai team's skills have been recognized by the audience. The Chen family generals are highly skilled. The eldest sister, Rongming, has broken free from the constraints of her gender. Watching her intercept, steal and shoot, one could hardly distinguish her from a young man. Chen Baixue, though short, is full of clever ideas. They simply don't care about others. The Hebei team initially intended to resist strongly, hoping to give the Shanghai team a setback, but they lacked the strength to do so. Helpless, they lost ground and were defeated.</p>
<p>After the start of the game, the Hebei team took the lead with a score of 4-2. However, they then suffered a setback. In the first half, they could barely cope, but in the second half, Chen Rongming showed excellent performance, scoring almost every shot. They won the first half with a score of 27-8. Seeing that the overall situation was set, Chen Rongming retired successfully, and Chen Jucai took over the throne. The competition became even more intense. Finally, Rongming returned to the field, and the score increased frequently. As a result, they won by a large margin with a score of 63-22.</p>

<p>Guangdong Overwhelms Zhejiang</p>
<p>At the appointed time, the match between Guangdong and Zhejiang started on time. Rong Xianhong of Guangdong is like Chen Rongming of Shanghai. She is agile and has excellent shooting form. Defender Jiao Huifen and Chen Baixue can be called the "Two Difficults." Their skills, appearance, and technique are all similar. Liu Mali is a famous general in Shanghai and represented Shanghai at the National Games two years ago. Her skills are superior. The Zhejiang team is of ordinary strength. When they encounter a strong enemy, they inevitably panic. Their formation is particularly chaotic, and their offense is unusually weak. Watching the daughters of the South grab everything, they couldn't reverse the situation. Except for scoring eight points through free throws, they had few shooting opportunities. The game became one-sided, and there is not much to record. The lineups are as follows:</p>

<p>Fujian Girls Sweep Central Plains</p>
<p>After the Guangdong-Zhejiang match, the second-round match between Fujian and Henan began with the referee Mr. Song's command. The Fujian team members were all petite and thin, looking like they could be blown away by the wind. But their tactics were superb, and the whole team cooperated well. The forwards and defenders moved in unison. Even the strong Shanghai team was not as good in terms of cooperation. Center Lin Suqing commanded the three armies and directed the battle with composure. The two forwards, Xu and Wu, assisted on the left and right, adding icing to the cake. The defenders also tried their best to fulfill their duties. The Henan team was uneven in quality. Forward Zhang Guishan and defender Yuan Hengrui had good individual skills, but they did not appear in the first match. By the time they came out to fight, their morale had been crushed. The Central Plains was lost, and they surrendered. The Xiamen ladies' army easily entered the quarterfinal week.</p>

<p>Jiangsu Misses Defeat the Old Capital</p>
<p>The finale was Jiangsu against Beiping. The strength of the two teams was about equal, so the game was very intense. Judging from past results, Jiangsu seemed to be slightly inferior to Beiping. However, the Beiping team showed panic yesterday, and their shooting was inaccurate. The defense was especially negligent. The Jiangsu team performed exceptionally well, especially captain Xu Biyun. Her long-range and close-range shots were like a godsend. She should be ranked first on the merit list. Defender Chen Zhaozhen was bold and careful, and Shao Weirong was as strong as an ox. The defense relied on her to maintain order.</p>
<p>Ping team was very lively originally, but was closely monitored yesterday and could not move freely. Shen Chongji was a talented general, but was suddenly recalled when the competition was fierce. This was a mistake by the team. If Beiping could have created an equal situation in the last minute, then the victory would have belonged to them. At the beginning of the game, Ping Shen Chongji opened the scoring, and Ding Zhengzheng followed with a free throw. Xu Biyun of the Jiangsu team returned the favor, and Zhao Huizhen launched a counterattack. They won the first quarter with a score of 6-4. Ha Qingci replaced Wang Yan and had a good start. Then Shen Chongji was suddenly recalled. Xu Biyun tried a shot from halftime and surprisingly scored. The Beiping team followed closely. At the end of the first half, they were only four points behind.</p>
<p>In the second half, Shen Chongji returned to the field and immediately scored a goal, reducing the difference to only two points. After that, neither side gave way. The score difference remained at four points. With three minutes left, the Jiangsu team led 24-18. Shen and Ding of Beiping quickly scored two goals, making the situation tense. Fortunately, Huang Lianzhen added two points. But soon, Ha of the Ping team turned around and shot, closing the gap again. The Jiangsu team was already exhausted and lost control. They were in great danger. They quickly called a timeout to rest. After the restart, one minute later, the whistle blew. The score was 24-21. Victory finally belonged to Jiangsu. The referee was Shu Hong, and the inspector was Song Junfu. The lineups are as follows:</p>
<p>Jiangsu   Field Goals   Free Throws   Fouls   Points</p>
<p>Zhang Ruiqin   0 0 0 0</p>
<p>Zhao Huizhen   2 0 0 4</p>

<p>Women's Softball</p>
<h3>Hebei Fortuitously Defeats Shanghai; Wins 8-6 and Gains the Right to the Finals</h3>
<p>Will Compete with Shandong on the 17th for the Championship</p>
<p>In women's softball, the Hebei team has been smooth sailing. After initially defeating Jiangsu, they defeated Shanghai yesterday and will compete with Shandong tomorrow afternoon at 2:00 PM for the championship. The champion of the previous National Games, Guangdong, has lost its right, and it has become a contest between Hebei and Shandong in the North China region. Yesterday, Mayor Wu of Shanghai visited the long-deserted stands to watch, which boosted morale. At the beginning of the game, there was a light rain, but fortunately, the weather cleared up soon, and the competition proceeded as usual, increasing excitement. The ball referee was Hou Luoxun, the base referee was Gao Zi, and the recorder was Xia Kaiming.</p>
<p>Lu Family Army Demonstrates Power in Hebei Team</p>
<p>Hebei pitcher Lu Yunyan, taking over from Lu Qingyan, was successful and performed well. The infield was closely guarded, and the outfield defense was thorough. It was not easy for Shanghai to score. In the seventh inning, Shanghai was able to score in four innings, relying on its magical batting skills. However, the Hebei team's overall pitching and catching skills and rich strategies were indeed superior to Shanghai. Its victory, although somewhat fortunate, was well-deserved. The nine players, the Lu family alone accounted for four, and their results were all outstanding. Some say that the Hebei team can also be called the Lu family sisters' army, which is a good story in women's softball.</p>
<p>Du Suzhen Leads Shanghai Team</p>
<p>The Shanghai team had high hopes and a determination to win the championship. It was unexpected to be poisoned on their first outing. According to the combat situation at that time, Shanghai was not necessarily unable to confront Hebei. Looking at the process from the second to the fifth innings, there was even a tendency to surpass it. How could it be that the loss in the first inning was too great, and in the end, in the sixth inning, it suffered an unexpected blow. Its enthusiasm has since disappeared. Its pitcher, Du Suzhen, is quite skilled. She is tall and graceful, and has the posture of leading the entire team. Catcher Qian Kunge did her best and never slackened. The infield and outfield caught high and low balls and responded well. Although defeated, she was still glorious.</p>
<p>Losing Six Points After Great Joy</p>
<p>Shanghai took the offensive first. Yang Yiren rushed forward. With a bat in hand, she watched the incoming ball. With good fortune, the bat was not in vain. The ball rolled out along the left sideline, steep and unstoppable. Yang Yiren rushed through the gate alone, first base, second base, second base to home base, hitting a home run in one fell swoop. The whole team was overjoyed. Unexpectedly, during Hebei's counterattack, Shanghai made a big mistake due to a slight carelessness, allowing Hebei to get four hits. Those who scored were Huang Lianpeng, Cui Huixian, Lu Huijin, Lu Yunyan, Li Wenxiu, and Lu Huiyan six people, which can be said to be misfortune and fortune are unpredictable.</p>
<p>Equal Scores Achieved Only After Five Innings of Struggle</p>
<p>Shanghai was hit hard and lost interest. Coach Shen Guoquan immediately gave instructions and the spirit was revived. In the second inning, Hu Zuoqiong ran and stole, and also returned to home base, scoring one point. In the third inning, they were in a stalemate and passed peacefully. In the fourth inning, Ling Zhisheng's ball went over the right wing and scored a base hit, scoring another point. Hebei remained the same and made no progress. The fifth inning was the era of Shanghai's overall victory. Four hits were discovered one after another, and Yang Yiren, Qian Kunyu, and Chen Zaichun scored back to base. At that time, the Shanghai team struggled for five innings to create a 6-6 tie, which was no easy task.</p>
<p>Two Hits Immediately Determine the Outcome</p>
<p>The score was equal after five innings. The difference was how well the sixth and seventh innings were played. Three Shanghai players were all turned away. When it was Hebei's turn, Lu Huiyan He Zha first ascended. The ball was like an arrow. Lu flew back, but forgot to touch second base halfway and was penalized to second base to await further orders. Fortunately, Chen Lanxiang helped with a hit, and Lu got her wish and scored one point. Chen also took advantage of the Shanghai pitcher's wild pitch to score and return. Hebei scored two points with two hits, and then defeated Shanghai 8-6 to win the second match and advance to compete with Shandong for the championship.</p>

<h3>The Truth is Revealed and the Situation Becomes Urgent; Nanjing and the Philippines Will Meet Today</h3>
<p>The Eight Strong Teams of Hebei, Guangdong, Qingdao, Beiping, Beijing, the Philippines, Hubei, and Shanghai will Hold the Second Round Matches Today</p>
<p>Men's basketball has been going on for a week. The eight teams that have obtained the right to the second round are Hebei, Guangdong, Qingdao, Beiping, Beijing, the Philippines, Hubei, and Shanghai. These eight teams will hold the second round matches one after another today. The first game is Nanjing against the Philippines, held at 9:00 AM. Nanjing is known for its stability, while the Philippines is known for its speed. At 10:00 AM, Shanghai will play against Hubei. Shanghai will likely be as slow as it was in the match against Shanxi the other day. It is feared that it will not be Hubei's opponent. At 1:00 PM, Qingdao will play against Beiping. Both sides have their strengths. The Beiping team has better coordination, and Qingdao's long-range shooting is formidable. Who will win is still uncertain. Hebei will play against Guangdong at 2:00 PM. Hebei has a higher chance of winning. In short, the weather is unpredictable, and human affairs change overnight. It is okay to say it casually, but I dare not write a guarantee. Only after the game will we know the result. It is expected that the gymnasium will be very prosperous today.</p>

<h3>Using Yong Zi Brand Small Leather Balls; National Games Small Ball Performance; Hubei and Shanghai Meet Today; At the Athletics Field at 1:00 PM</h3>
<p>The small ball performance, which is highly anticipated, will be held at the athletics field of the conference today at 1:00 PM. The strong generals of the Hubei team have all experienced hundreds of battles. Jiang Chao is agile, Shao Yougong is stable, Huang Jingui is refreshing, Fu Zhibin is fierce, and Huang Guorong is exquisite. The front and back are connected, forming a cohesive force. The generals of the Shanghai mixed team, such as Tang Zuolin and Shen Longzhang guarding the iron gate, Yu Qiaxing and Yu Chuhua as defenders, Zhang Jinhai and Cao Qinfang as forwards, and Shen Jinda and Li Zushou, are like a tiger with wings. The combat effectiveness is also very strong. At that time, when the two heroes fight each other, who will win is difficult to predict.</p>
<p>According to the performance, the leather ball used is the Yong Zi brand leather ball approved by the Shanghai Small Ball Association, produced by Yonghe Industrial Company, which can be called a standard leather ball.</p>

<h3>Old Rivals Meet Again on a Narrow Road; Shanghai and Guangdong Obtain the Right to the Quarterfinals; Shanghai Eliminates Hubei 10-1; Guangdong Defeats Nanjing 12-1</h3>
<p>Yesterday, soccer entered the semi-quarterfinal stage. Shanghai played against Hubei at 9:00 AM, and Guangdong played against Nanjing at 4:00 PM. The strength difference between the two sides was too great, and both sides became one-sided. In addition, the field was muddy and the water had not dried up, so the performances were not exciting, and the audience lost interest. As a result, Shanghai won against Hubei 10-1, and Guangdong won against Nanjing 12-1, obtaining the right to the quarterfinals. Shanghai and Guangdong will meet on the afternoon of the 18th at 3:00 PM to compete for the right to the finals. Who will win in the Central Plains competition? In the previous National Games, Guangdong was defeated by Shanghai in the finals. Now they meet again in the quarterfinals. Will they avenge their humiliation? Tens of thousands of fans are watching and waiting.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Beats the Hubei Team Soundly; Hubei Finally Scored One Point in the End</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 9:00, the soccer match between Shanghai and Hubei began. The strength difference between the two sides was huge. Hubei was always under the Shanghai team's siege. They could not attack, nor could they defend. Eleven minutes after the kickoff, Li Yichen attacked the hinterland and lightly kicked the ball into the net. The Hubei army defended with all its might, using the muddy and waterlogged terrain to its advantage to deal with the Shanghai army. For twenty minutes, no further goals were scored. The Shanghai army then unleashed its divine power and changed its strategy. Sun Jinshun, Feng Yunyou, and Dai Linjing each scored a goal, ending the first half with a score of 4-0. Changing sides and fighting again, Shanghai's momentum grew stronger. Within three minutes, Zhan Linjing scored with a header. Soon, the Hubei side conceded two more goals. Although they had a free kick opportunity, they did not score. After a long struggle, Sun Jinshun and Dai Linjing of Shanghai each scored another goal. Soon, the Hubei army counterattacked and won a corner kick. Right inside forward Fu Zhibin received the ball and lightly shot it into the net, scoring the most precious goal. The whole stadium erupted in cheers, because the audience's psychology was to sympathize with the weak. Finally, Li Yichen seized an opportunity and scored another goal. The second half was 6-1, and the total score was 10-1. The Hubei army was defeated.</p>

<h3>Guangdong Eliminates Nanjing; Twelve to One, Avoiding a Shutout</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:00, the soccer match between Guangdong and Nanjing began. After two or three rounds, the ball was at the feet of Xiao Heitan, who showed his power and rushed in, successfully opening the scoring. Soon, Yang Shuiyi received the ball and shot from a distance, sending the ball into the net. Nanjing launched a counterattack, but their passing was poor, and the ball was often intercepted midway. After a fierce battle, Nanjing did not gain anything, while Guangdong's score gradually increased. Tan Jiangbai, Yang Shuiyi, and others frequently scored. The first half ended with Guangdong leading 7-0.</p>
<p>After the break, the battle resumed. The Guangdong army's five tigers clashed left and right, as if they were in no man's land. Xiao Heitan roamed the entire field, his power undiminished. The Beijing side was helpless and unable to resist, and successively lost four cities. At this time, Yang Renwei, the left winger of Beijing, had a plan of borrowing an arrow with his back to the domain. He broke into the enemy camp alone and attacked the goal with lightning speed. With good luck, he scored, and the cheering crowd avoided a shutout. Finally, Li Hongqing, the left forward of Hong Kong, completed a dozen goals in the twilight, winning 12-1.</p>

<h3>The Guangdong Team Demonstrates Power and Skill, Defeating Hong Kong</h3>
<p>2-3: The Women Display Their Majestic Power and Divine Abilities, a Fierce Battle That Is Hard to Resolve</p>
<p>In the second round of the women's volleyball competition, there were two matches yesterday. (1) Shanghai versus Henan: Henan had already declared their forfeit, so Shanghai automatically gained the right to advance to the next round. (2) Guangdong versus Hong Kong: A close sibling rivalry, exceptionally intense. In the end, Guangdong won. The match results are as follows:</p>
<p>Siblings Clash, Court Heats Up</p>
<p>When it comes to volleyball talent, due to the convenience of competition and training, most successes belong to the daughters of the South. This is originally governed by talent and environment, and cannot be forced upon others. Both Hong Kong and Guangdong are skilled in this area. When heroes meet, each focusing on their own future, their fight will naturally be a cut above. With fame and fortune at stake, their fraternal feelings, however strong, can only be set aside. Based on this stance, the audience at the women's volleyball court became even more crowded. Men and women mixed together, and the side stands were packed. Boy Scouts were busy maintaining order, demonstrating the strong appeal of both teams. The excitement of the volleyball court was indeed the greatest of this year's event.</p>
<p>Fit and Beautiful Women Display Their Divine Abilities</p>
<p>Around 2:00 PM, the Guangdong team, led by Yang Xingfen, took to the court. The Hong Kong team, led by Zhu Yingfen, followed. These heroines, amid their flowery beauty, possessed a spirit of fortitude and strength. Their demeanor was magnificent, truly worthy of being called fit and beautiful women. The match began at 3:00 PM, with Hong Kong taking the initiative and setting records. Zhu Jiaoxin gritted his teeth, unwilling to easily concede his former glory. He quickly caught up, making progress and adjustments in both offense and defense. However, the back row defense was weak, so when the ball entered shallowly into their territory, it was difficult to recover. As a result, they easily lost the first set with a score of 21-17.</p>
<p>Roaring, They Retake a Set</p>
<p>With Hong Kong winning the first set, the entire stadium became even more lively. They seemed to be sailing smoothly, full of momentum. At 5-5, Yan Xiurong and Yang Yuqiong of the Guangdong team became determined to win, whispering to each other and plotting a decisive move. Sure enough, a ball entered the territory, and they roared in victory. Despite their small stature, their strength was extraordinary. Leaping and striking from afar, they entered the enemy's baseline. The Hong Kong team was busy defending the net and did not expect such a surprise attack. The ball entered their rear, and they couldn't recover. From then on, the momentum shifted, and they switched sides at 11-7. Lin Dezhen of the Guangdong team committed a serving error, and the Hong Kong team also scored some points. In the end, Guangdong won with a score of 21-17.</p>
<p>Fierce Battle, Veteran Assassin</p>
<p>With both sides winning and losing, the competition was exceptionally fierce under the premise of equally matched opponents. The audience on the sidelines shouted and cheered. The sharp cries of "Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful" from some of the female athletes created a chaotic atmosphere. The first half of the third set was uneventful. In the second half, the scores became close, and both sides grew anxious. They engaged in close combat, with no flaws to exploit. Thus, they advanced from 20-20 to 22-22. Finally, Yan Xiurong took advantage of a high ball opportunity, rushed to the net, and made a decisive kill. Although Yan Xiurong is not old, she has the demeanor of a veteran. Calm and composed, she is indeed admirable. The score was 24-22.</p>
<p>Dazzling, the Guangdong Army Suffers Another Setback</p>
<p>The fourth set began amidst the majestic power of the women. Like dense clouds and sudden rain, it was difficult to distinguish the victor. Hong Kong could attack, but their killing blows lacked strength. The back-row players, Ye Huiwen and Tang Meiyu, were also relatively weak. Under such circumstances, they felt exhausted. To the audience, it was dazzling, and they immediately felt overwhelmed. In the first half of the fourth set, Guangdong took an 11-7 lead and switched sides. However, they carelessly lost Jingzhou in the second half. The Central Plains were again overrun with invaders, and as a result, Hong Kong created a 21-18 lead.</p>
<p>Blood and Passion, Skillful Control</p>
<p>The fifth set was the crucial point for the right to advance to the next round. The Guangdong team gave it their all, pouring out their blood and passion. Sure enough, they achieved remarkable results, narrowly winning 11-9. When they switched sides, the Hong Kong team unexpectedly adopted a polite and humble attitude, giving away points. The Guangdong players were able to roam freely on the volleyball court, attacking relentlessly. The Hong Kong team, knowing that the situation was hopeless, played casually, as if strumming a pipa. Guangdong skillfully controlled the situation and won 21-12. The reason for their victory was partly due to Hong Kong's relaxation and partly due to their rich experience. The overall score was 3-2.</p>
<p>Strange Behavior, Zhejiang Defeated</p>
<p>The Hong Kong team arrived for practice at 12:30 PM yesterday. Their heroic spirit was evident as they were supported by ten female athletes. Their veteran demeanor was fully displayed. At the beginning, the Zhejiang team came onto the court, ready to serve. He Shuju's first serve failed. Li Wolin of Hong Kong rescued the ball and passed it to the left corner. Lu Baining saw an opportunity, raised his arm, and struck quickly, opening the scoring. Lu Xitie, the captain of the Zhejiang team, had always been resolute and unwilling to be outdone. During Hong Kong's serve, he stood alone, blocking the incoming attacks. There were some tricks, and the scores remained close from 6-6, 7-7, to 8-8 and 9-9. Although Hong Kong was experienced, they felt at a loss. In the second half, after switching sides, Lu Baining of the Hong Kong team served. The ball was flat and hard, and there was no one to receive it in Zhejiang's backcourt. As a result, a series of shots hit their mark, scoring six consecutive points and leaving Zhejiang with no chance of survival. Amid strange behavior, Zhejiang lost the first set 17-21.</p>
<p>Farewell to the Old, Welcome to the New, Another Loss</p>
<p>In the second set, Zhejiang hoped to recover their lost ground, but they were unlucky. They lost four points early on. After gradually catching up, Hong Kong added to the score again. When Zhang Xihu served, Hong Kong returned the ball. Zhang then rushed to the net, blocking the way out. With self-created plays, it was a scene of "farewell to the old, welcome to the new." From this, it was evident that Zhejiang lacked organization. Hong Kong took an 11-7 lead before switching sides. Zhejiang's counterattack was fierce, but unfortunately, there were many setbacks. Under the psychological pressure of a narrow win, they widened the score difference. The final score was 21-13. The athletes from the West Lake region remained under the control of the Hong Kong team.</p>
<p>Breaking Through Barriers, Surprisingly Turning the Tide</p>
<p>In the third set, Zhejiang showed some progress. Hong Kong failed to be humble and retained some arrogance. As a result, He Shusheng and others in Zhejiang successfully coordinated their attacks. In an instant, they boldly broke through barriers, miraculously escaping death and turning the tide. However, the score never reflected this newfound energy, with the final score being a narrow 19-21.</p>
<p>Strengthening Defenses, Ultimately Winning</p>
<p>In the fourth set, after a break, Zhejiang intended to launch a rapid attack, but due to a lack of coordination and defensive work in the entire team, Zhang Xihu found it difficult to fight alone. Thus, the score gap widened again. The first half ended hastily, with Hong Kong taking an 11-5 lead. The outcome was largely determined. After switching sides, before Zhejiang could launch an attack, the three players in Hong Kong's front row had strengthened their defenses, preventing any disruption of the internal order. Amid the audience's cheers, Hong Kong again defeated Zhejiang by a large margin of 21-9. The overall score was 2-1.</p>
<p>(2) Shanghai Wins Against Hebei</p>
<p>Stealing Camps, Conquering Strategically</p>
<p>The second match was held at 3:00 PM. Qian Jima summoned the Shanghai and Hebei teams to battle. The Shanghai team included national team veterans such as Cao Tingzan and Qiu Guangxie. Their glorious records had been established long ago. Zhang Yicheng of Hebei took the initiative and scored two points. Chen Dongcai of the Shanghai team effectively countered, tying the score. From then on, in the chaotic situation, the Shanghai team's attacks through the middle were lacking. Knowing that Hebei was known for its Nankai veterans, their net blocking and attacks were blocked by the opponent's high jumps. However, they took advantage of the gaps, stealing camps and conquering strategically, a proven tactic in warfare. A small display of skill caused the honest Hebei to fall apart. Shanghai won the set 21-17 by conquering strategically.</p>
<p>Qiu and Cao Display Their Power, Winning Two More Sets</p>
<p>In the second set, Shanghai pressed the attack. Qiu Guangxie served with great accuracy, contributing significantly. Cao Tingzan coordinated in the middle, and his skills were unique. Hebei relied on situational changes, focusing on opportunities. Thus, when high balls came, they were sent to the front, where the middle row raised high and the front row gently hit them down, creating a clever coordination between the front and back. They once led 7-6. However, when Qiu Guangxie served again, the momentum shifted back to Shanghai, and they faced a do-or-die situation. With smooth and rapid attacks, Shanghai won another set. The score was 21-7.</p>
<p>Artillery Bombardment, Three Straight Sets</p>
<p>In the third set, Hebei showed some progress in their struggle. However, their counter-attacking power was extremely weak. They were busy parrying the attacks. Unable to withstand the heavy pressure from the Shanghai team, the tense situation did not improve. When both sides reached 12 points, Shanghai launched an artillery bombardment, destroying all defensive structures. In this set, Shanghai achieved final success, quickly advancing to the next round with three straight sets. The score was 21-14.</p>

<h3>Volleyball Second Round: Shanghai and Hong Kong Advance to the Next Round, Zhejiang and Hebei Are Eliminated</h3>
<p>There were two men's volleyball matches yesterday in the second round. (1) Hong Kong versus Zhejiang; (2) Shanghai versus Hebei. Hong Kong and Zhejiang have always been highly regarded in volleyball. Shanghai is also focused on winning the championship. Hebei is not an ordinary opponent. Therefore, the matches were filled with energy. The results of the two matches and the detailed events are recorded below.</p>

<h3>All-Around Championship Prediction: Liaoning Highly Favored, Shanghai Second</h3>
<p>Pentathlon</p>
<p>Guo Jie of Liaoning is the most skilled in the pentathlon, with excellent performance in running, jumping, and throwing. Chen Baoqiu of Hubei will participate in the pentathlon. Baoqiu excels in the triathlon, but his javelin and discus throws are likely to be inferior to Guo Jie's. In addition to Guo, Liaoning also has Li Shiming. Li's javelin throw is 47 meters, long jump is 6 meters, discus throw is 30 meters, 200-meter run is 24 seconds, and the 1500-meter run is his forte. Hao Chunde of Shanghai has been disqualified. Wang Jizhun is the national record holder, but his recent performance has declined, and he may not be able to defend his championship. Ji Demao of Shanxi and Peng Yongxin of Beiping are also expected to finish in the top five or six.</p>
<p>Decathlon</p>
<p>The championship likely belongs to veteran Zhang Lingjia. Zhou Changxing of Liaoning was the decathlon champion at last year's North China Games. He has a chance of winning the silver medal this year. Wang Shilin of Beiping and Liang Zhichu of Guangdong are also expected to score points.</p>
<p>Two Relay Races</p>
<p>In the 400-meter relay, the Malayan team has the strongest overall strength, followed by Liaoning and Shanghai. Liaoning's team includes Liu Changchun, Wu Jingyao, Jin Changxian, and Li Shiming. Shanghai's team includes emerging young athletes Chen Yongfu, Huang Feilong, Dong Shichu, and Jiang Songping. In the 1600-meter relay, Shanghai should have no problem winning the championship with Dong Shuzhao and Dai Shuguo. Liaoning will also strive for the silver medal in the 1600-meter relay. Liu Changchun will run the 400-meter leg, and Li Shiming and Dong Hanwen are also strong. However, they face strong opponents such as Fu Jincheng from the Malayan team.</p>

<p>Men's and Women's National Martial Arts</p>
<h3>National Martial Arts Pellet Shooting Finals: Wei Wenqing of Henan First, Liu Yuhua Has a One-Woman Show</h3>
<p>The National Games Martial Arts competition began yesterday morning at 9:00 AM with the men's and women's pellet shooting finals. Because the number of participants was small, it ended at 11:00 AM. From 1:00 PM in the afternoon, the men's group equipment sparring preliminary rounds were held. Finally, the men's wrestling second round was held, ending around 5:00 PM. The details are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Pellet Shooting Finals</p>
<p>In the men's and women's pellet shooting competition in the morning, there were twelve male athletes participating: Wang Fuhai, Ning Haiting, Qu Guotian, and Liu Chenheng from Beiping; Zhang Haiqin, Liu Quantu, Zhang Qing, and Wei Wenqing from Henan; Zhao Xiuting from Shandong, who withdrew from the competition; Zhao Youlian and Zheng Liren from Shanghai; and Jian Fengxiang from Hunan. There was only one female participant, Ms. Liu Yuhua from Henan, who could be said to have a one-woman show. The pellet distance for women was 15 meters. Liu Yuhua started first, firing three pellets in a row, none of which hit the target. It wasn't until the second round of shooting that she hit one pellet out of three, scoring two points, just barely avoiding getting a zero score. Most interestingly, after the competition, Ms. Liu playfully shot two pellets with the bow, both hitting the bullseye. Ms. Liu exclaimed, "How infuriating, how infuriating!" The men's group competition resulted in the selection of six athletes as winners. Their ranks, names, and scores are listed below.</p>
<p>Women's Group</p>
<p>Rank Name Unit Score</p>
<p>1921 Liu Yuhua Henan 3</p>
<p>Men's Group</p>
<p>Rank Name Unit Score</p>
<p>1st Place Wei Wenqing Henan 11 points</p>
<p>2nd Place Liu Yongheng Beiping 8 points</p>
<p>3rd Place Qu Guotian Beiping 8 points</p>
<p>4th Place Zhao Youlian Shanghai 6 points</p>
<p>5th Place Zhang Deqin Henan 5 points</p>
<p>6th Place Ning Haiting Beiping 5 points</p>
<p>Equipment Sparring Preliminary Rounds</p>
<p>The equipment sparring preliminary rounds began at 1:00 PM in the afternoon. Blades and spears flew back and forth, with each participant refusing to yield. Among them, Wu Yukun's performance of Double Moons Fighting with Swords was especially intense. In the empty-handed spear capture performed by Wu Binlou and Huang Maoting, Wu first attacked Huang with a long spear. Huang, although empty-handed, responded with ease. When Wu thrust the spear fiercely towards Huang's chest, Wu leaned to the left, raised his right hand, and snatched the spear. There were many more exciting moments at the handover. Other outstanding performances included Feng Zhenwu and Lu Zhenlin's Three-Section Staff versus Crutches, Ma Hongzhi and Wang Zhang's Sword versus Spear, and Wang Yunqing and Liu Lanqing's Three-Section Staff versus Spear. The results of the preliminary rounds are as follows:</p>
<p>Wrestling Finals Today</p>
<p>The second round of martial arts wrestling was held after the equipment sparring preliminary rounds. Zhang Wenshan, the big fat man from Beiping, waddled onto the stage. His opponent was Ma Wenkui, a wrestler from Nanjing. Although Ma was not as fat as Zhang, he was tall, strong, and muscular. The two began their fight, and after three rounds, they were evenly matched, true rivals. When the fourth round began, Ma knew that he could not win by force, so he used skill. As he grabbed Zhang's clothing, he raised his right foot and hooked Zhang's calf. Zhang fell, and the onlookers applauded. Judging from yesterday's events, Ma Wenkui has a good chance of winning the championship. How will it turn out? We'll have to wait for today's finals.</p>
<h3>Review of Men's and Women's Track and Field: Commendable Progress in All Events</h3>
<p>The 6th National Games men's and women's track and field competitions concluded yesterday after six days of hard work. The all-around competitions will begin today. There were 31 male track teams, 33 male field teams, and 21 female track and field teams participating, which is more than in the previous National Games, a welcome phenomenon. Shanghai, relying on its average talent and gathering of athletes, won three championships, which was expected. The Malayan compatriots returned to China for the first time and showed their talent, posing a great threat to all teams. They won the silver medal in the men's track and the women's track and field competitions, and also ranked seventh in the men's field competition, which is commendable. Other teams such as Sichuan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Guangxi, and Weihaiwei, which failed to score in previous games, also made inroads, showing that track and field sports have gradually become popular throughout the country. It is expected that the next games will be even more heated and that the results will be further improved. In terms of individual event results, Fu Baolu's pole vault of 3.90 meters and Peng Yongxin's javelin throw of 50.275 meters both broke national records, and Liu Furun's shot put of 12.30 meters broke the Games record. These performances were outstanding. Especially Fu Baolu's pole vault, which almost broke the Far East record and approached the world record, was the biggest harvest of the Games. The other events, although not breaking records, were very close to the old records. In the high jump event, if Wu Bixian had not been disqualified, he might have set a new standard. In the men's track events, Dai Shuguo's 400-meter time of 52.2 seconds broke Liu Changchun's national record of 52.6 seconds, which had stood for seven years. Jia Lianren's 800-meter time of 2 minutes and 2.1 seconds was also remarkable, and the second and third place finishers, Li Shiming and Dong Shuzhao, also exceeded the old record. It is a pity that the other events did not break all the records, either due to weather conditions or the looseness of the track. In the women's track and field events, except for the 100-meter hurdles and the shot put, all national and Games records were shattered, which is a shame for the men's group. The increasing development of women's sports in China is evident here. In terms of individuals, Li Sen is undoubtedly the most outstanding athlete, and she is now firmly established as the top sprinter in China. Deng Yinjiao, who returned from abroad, showed her talent, and her long jump result was able to break the 5-meter barrier, which added a lot of color to the Games. Qian Xingsu and Chen Rongtang were able to maintain their inherent prestige. It is hoped that the winners will not be arrogant and the losers will not be discouraged, but will continue to work hard and strive for excellence, so that they will be able to enter the world stage in the future, which is not a luxury.</p>

<p>Shanghai YMCA Welcomes Team Leaders at Yesterday's Banquet</p>
<p>The Shanghai YMCA held a banquet on the ninth floor of its building in Baixianqiao at 7:30 PM last night to welcome the National Games athletes and leaders. All directors and staff of the YMCA were present to warmly greet the guests. In addition to the invited athletes and leaders, there were also National Games staff and journalists. More than 200 people attended. After the dinner, the chairman, Mr. Lu Gan Chen, the general secretary of the YMCA, gave a welcome speech on behalf of all members. He was followed by Mr. Wang Zhengting, the honorary president of the YMCA, who said that the YMCA was the first to promote sports, and that the rapid progress of sports in China is a cause for national celebration. However, compared with the level of sports in other countries, there is still a gap, and he hoped that everyone would work hard. Finally, there was music by the Zhu brothers and songs by the YMCA's public singing group to add to the entertainment. All attendees enjoyed themselves immensely and dispersed.</p>
<p>Wu Xingya Receives Hubei Athletes</p>
<p>The National Games opened, and athletes from all over the country gathered in Shanghai. Wu Xingya, the Director of the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, originally from Hubei, hosted a reception at the Dadong Restaurant last night for the athletes and representatives from Hubei province attending the National Games, due to their shared hometown relationship. Those attending included Chen Shucheng, President of Wuchang Zhonghua University, Liu Changhe, General Leader, Ke Nanshan, Deputy Leader, and Song Ruhai, totaling 70 people, as well as Guan Jiongzhi, Wang Shao cheng, and the journalists Fang Guoxi and Liu Zhangbing from the Hubei Shanghai Native Place Association, totaling about 100 people.

<h3>Mongolian, Xinjiang, and Tibetan Athletes Sing Folk Songs from Remote Regions; City Radio Broadcasts</h3>
<p>Mongolian, Xinjiang, and Tibetan athletes sang folk songs from remote regions, such as "Youth's Ambition" and "Horse Riding Song," at the National Games Arts and Entertainment Convention in the gymnasium at 8:00 PM yesterday. The songs were loud, clear, and had a unique flavor, and the audience applauded. The Shanghai City Radio also broadcasted them.</p>
<h3>The Thirty-Second Army Polo Team Will Perform Tomorrow Afternoon</h3>
<p>The eleven members of the Beiping 32nd Army Polo Team have come to Shanghai and are preparing to perform at the National Games arena at 3:00 PM tomorrow afternoon. The team's achievements have long been famous in North China. They once wanted to come to Shanghai to perform, but were unable to do so due to circumstances. This time, they were finally able to come to Shanghai to perform on the occasion of the National Games. People in Shanghai have rarely seen this skill, and there will be an unprecedented grand occasion at that time.</p>

The performance of ball sports has generally reached a good level, which is gratifying. I urge you to continue to work hard, to be models for young people across the country, and to increase the glory of the Games. Your brother, Wang Shijie."</p>

<h3>Student Special Train to Visit the National Games - Two Railway Bureaus Decide to Discontinue</h3>
<p>Due to insufficient student ridership, there appears to be no need to continue operating</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education issued a public notice stating: "Approved based on a letter from the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus stating that the special train for students from schools in the Nanshi district of Shanghai to visit the current National Games was launched on the 10th of this month, operating once daily between Shangnan and Sanmin Road. However, it has been reported that each special train carries only a dozen or so students, making its continued operation unnecessary. It is hereby decided that the special train will be discontinued from the 15th of this month. This notice is to be circulated for awareness." Signed, Director Pan Gongzhan.</p>
<h3>Odds and Ends</h3>
<p>Liang Yunsen Breaks Two New Records</p>
<p>Javelin thrower Liang Yunsen exceeded the national record twice yesterday, to his delight. He quickly leaped forward to check the record. It happened twice.</p>
<p>Little Dai is Indeed Capable</p>
<p>Dai Shuguo's forte is the 400-meter race. In the preliminary rounds two days ago, he was outshone by Singaporean star Chuan Jincheng in both races. Yesterday, in the final, he didn't allow any more surprises, leaving Chuan behind by two meters and setting a new national record of 52.2 seconds. This proves that his skill is truly extraordinary.</p>
<p>Tall, Short, Thin, and Fat Compete in the 10,000 Meters</p>
<p>A total of thirty-one athletes participated in yesterday's 10,000-meter race, varying in height and build. A quick sketch: the tallest was the Beiping's Niu Qunzhi, the shortest was Shanghai's Zhang Liang, the thinnest was Shanghai's Wang Zhenglin, and the fattest was Weihai's Cao Yanyou.</p>
<p>One Representative Does Not Fail His Mission</p>
<p>Guangxi was represented by only one athlete in this National Games, Huang Wenyi. In yesterday's 10,000-meter final, Yang stuck close to Monkey King from behind, eventually securing fifth place and earning two valuable points for Guangxi in track and field. He is certainly more dedicated than those who normally perform well but abandon the race on the spot.</p>
<p>Miss Li Sen Asks, "Do You Still Want More?"</p>
<p>During the 200-meter final yesterday afternoon, female running champion Li Sen showed her prowess and set a new national record. The audience cheered, "Amazing girl!" Immediately, over a dozen photographers surrounded Li Sen, requesting photos one after another for a full three minutes. Li Sen, still catching her breath, exclaimed, "Please hurry! Do you still want more?"</p>
<p>Spectators Yesterday Complained of Being Duped</p>
<p>The weather two days ago was uncomfortably hot, an odd phenomenon for late autumn. The previous night, the heavens were unkind and poured down heavy rain. Yesterday, overcast skies and fog enveloped the area. A few spectators carried umbrellas and wore raincoats. Sadly, the heavens played a trick and did not rain. Those who had not brought umbrellas were relieved, while those who had were complaining of being "duped."</p>
<p>Loud Roll Call Causes Embarrassment</p>
<p>During the softball game yesterday, when the referee called out the numbers of the female athletes, one of them responded softly. However, the announcer searched around but couldn't find her, so he raised his voice and called her again. She suddenly turned towards the referee and smiled shyly, causing the referee great embarrassment.</p>
<p>The Games' Music is Very Pleasing</p>
<p>The most attention-grabbing aspect of this National Games is the music played by the two Public Security and Security Music Bands on both sides of the commander's stand at the beginning and end of each event, when records are broken, awards are given, and finals are held. The melodious sounds invigorate the entire audience, and even the athletes feel more energized.</p>
<p>Tu Zhenglin Was Prescient</p>
<p>Yesterday at noon, before the 10,000-meter race, we visited Wang Zhenglin, Shanghai's star long-distance runner, at his dormitory. We asked for his thoughts on the upcoming 10,000-meter race. Initially, Wang refused to speak directly, only offering a wry smile. After the reporter's persistent questioning, he finally said, "Then my 1,500..." He indeed won the silver medal after the race, as if Wang had foreseen it, displaying a sense of prescience.</p>
<p>Female Athletes Mistake Chen Zhenxing, the Water Monster, for Lin Baohua</p>
<p>Yesterday, while Chen Zhenxing, the "Water Monster," was swimming in the corridor, several female athletes from Henan mistakenly identified him as Lin Baohua. One of them pointed to him and said to her companion, "Isn't that Lin Baohua?" Upon hearing this, the "Water Monster" replied in Cantonese-accented Mandarin, "I am not Lin Baohua. You have mistaken me." Realizing their mistake, they quickly left, embarrassed.</p>
<p>Zhejiang's Female Athletes Drive a Hard Bargain</p>
<p>After the Zhejiang women's basketball team defeated Shandong, the players became extremely proud and insisted on the team leader throwing a celebration banquet. As a result, a banquet was held at the New Asia Restaurant on Guoguang Road, where the entire team of athletes feasted.</p>
<p>Track and Field Awards: Temporary Consription</p>
<p>The awarding of medals to track and field athletes takes place immediately after each event. Those giving out the awards are temporarily conscripted from the VIPs at the commander's stand. Yesterday, those present tried their best to avoid being conscripted, but to no avail. Seeing Wu Xingya sitting high in the stands, he was temporarily roped in to present the awards.</p>
<h3>Behind-the-Scenes at the Games</h3>
<p>Li Sen Loves to Eat National Games Rice</p>
<p>It is said that this National Games is Li Sen's world. Yesterday, Miss Li and other Shanghai team athletes such as Liang Runsen, Qian Kunge, and Chu Zaichun were dining at Guanshengyuan. I asked her what she was eating, and she said, "I am eating National Games rice." The reporter was quite puzzled. Later, I learned that "National Games rice" is another name for the Ten Scenery Rice. It's truly difficult for Miss Li.</p>
<p>Where Did Qian Xing Su Run To?</p>
<p>After the women's 200-meter final, the announcer shouted, "Please will the medal-winning athletes come to the commander's stand to receive their awards." After waiting for a long time, only five female athletes arrived, and Qian Xing Su was missing. Some say that Miss Qian had been ill for several days, resulting in poor performance and constantly outdone by Miss Li, completely disheartened, so she didn't even want the prize.</p>
<p>Everyone Says, "Hello, Fellow Townsman!"</p>
<p>When athletes from Shandong, Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, and other northern provinces meet, their first words are always, "Hello, fellow townsman!" Yesterday, after Gu Desheng won the 10,000-meter race, a reporter went up to shake his hand and also said, "Hello, fellow townsman!" causing much laughter among the bystanders.</p>
<p>Miss Meng Says, "A Terrible Misunderstanding!"</p>
<p>Miss Meng Jianli's wrestling uniform was torn during the match the day before, leading to yesterday's report that "Meng Jianli's Spring Revealed." Miss Meng said, "A terrible misunderstanding!" and asked the reporter to correct it, clarifying that only the hem of her jacket was torn the day before, and no "spring light" was revealed.</p>
<p>The Barefoot Immortal Is Truly Brave</p>
<p>During the 10,000-meter final, Hei Longjiang athlete Lu Yongfeng suddenly took off his running shoes and competed barefoot halfway through the race. The audience hailed him as the "Barefoot Immortal." Running in last place, the starter specially fired a shot for him, and the photographers swarmed around him. His moment in the spotlight was no less than that of Gu Desheng.</p>
<h3>Special Notes From The Games</h3>
<p>The National Games has been open for a week, and so far, it seems to have more than 300,000 people in attendance. Judging from reporter observation, the spectators consist of mostly 90% from urban, professional women and above. As far as the rural farmer population is concerned, looking around the venue, except for service workers, there are hardly any in attendance. At the very least, their attendance is an exceptionally small number, meaning that the interest in sports seems to only be accessible to the cities and has yet to spread throughout the rural countryside.</p>
<p>Guest seating at the sports grounds are divided into two jiao, four jiao, six jiao, and one yuan seating prices. The two-yuan seats are best, followed by the six and four jiao seats. Two jiao seats are at the northern and southern end of the sports grounds and are in a terrible location, but more often than not, these seats are full and always have new people trying to find a foothold, but they never can. On the contrary, the one yuan seats are usually empty. This shows that the purchasing power of spectators is very limited. The most interest lies in all the ball-related games; with the exception of baseball. With each match, the small amount of viewers resemble the morning stars, giving off a cold and desolate sight. This is probably because those from Shandong are eating Mantou: they don't understand the game.</p>
<p>In the past three days, the wind of athletes signing autographs has risen. Children in Boy Scout uniforms are now holding notebooks and waiting for the winning athletes to award the prizes at the games. This causes the mob to surge to the front and takes an extended amount of time. Even if it is a point of pride for the athlete, spectators have already grown impatient.</p>
<p>The name for the fifth-place athlete from Guangxi, Huang Ruiwen, was listed as Wang Ruiwen on the athlete roster. After running the 10,000 meters yesterday, Huang went to the broadcasting booth and did a full 90-degree bow towards Wu Bangwei to clarify the error. After stating the correction, he bowed again and left, exhibiting polite manners and commanding respect. All other athletes should follow this example.

<h3>Shanghai Alumni Associations of National Southeast University and National Central University Host Banquet for National Games Participants</h3>
<p>The current National Games are being held in Shanghai, and representatives from various provinces and cities have come to Shanghai to participate. National Southeast University and National Central University have produced a large number of talented individuals in the fields of education and sports. This National Games has many technical experts working for the athletics portion that graduated from those schools. Additionally, the teachers and leaders from various provinces and cities' sports departments are mostly graduates from these schools. Seven or eight of these people have convened in Shanghai for this event. To welcome their visiting alumni, the local Shanghai branch of the Alumni Association hosted a public banquet at the Shanghai YMCA in the Eight Immortals Bridge yesterday at 7:00 PM. Wu Yunrui, Wu Bangwei, Wu Wei, Chen Kun, Zhang Jiwu, Wu Huilan, Yuan Shenlian, Jiang Liangui, Wang Fudan, Shen Peiyan, Yu Shufen, Li Jiyuan, Wu Demao, Chen Shizhen from the National Games staff, He Zhuangyu, and committee members of the Shanghai Branch such as Tai Shuangqiu, Lu Shuping, Jiang Jianbai, Shao Rugan, Jiang Xiangqing, Tian Ding'an, Hu Shuyi, Zhang Jixin, Qian Mengwei, Xu Renwu, Zheng Shijue, and Huang Shaoxu attended the banquet with around 70 other people. Drinks and speeches exchanged throughout the banquet. Old friends and new acquaintances filled the night and the banquet only came to a close around 9:00 PM.</p>
<h3>National Table Tennis Finals Last Night</h3>
<p>Macau Wins Against Shanghai, Hong Kong Defeats Jiangsu</p>
<p>The national table tennis competition finals were held last night at the Central Auditorium. Each team participating in the finals was evenly matched and showed their skills, attracting a packed crowd of spectators. The tense performances of each team captivated the audience, particularly the last game between Macau and Shanghai, where the outcome was to determine victory for either side. The referee caused a misunderstanding between the two teams. The Shanghai team, as the host team, were under immense pressure to concede their title. The match between Macau and Hong Kong was affected by the Macau-Shanghai misunderstanding, causing the games to run long, so a decision was made to extend the games another day. The previous night's results for each team are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Group One</p>
<p>Macau Team Shanghai Team Result Winner</p>
<p>Huang Yongnian Zou Guofan 1-3 Shanghai</p>
<p>Liang Wenhuan Lu Hanjun 1-3 Shanghai</p>
<p>Zheng Guorong Rong Deneng 3-1 Macau</p>
<p>Chen Guowei Chen Zhaowen 3-0 Macau</p>
<p>Guan Yongpu Zhou Gongxian 3-2 Macau</p>
<p>Group Two</p>
<p>Jiangsu Team Hong Kong Team Result Winner</p>
<p>Li Baopei Zhu Panzhi 3-2 Jiangsu</p>
<p>Zhang Liansheng Pan Shifang 3-3 Hong Kong</p>
<p>Zhu Kuisheng Yi Jingguang 3-1 Jiangsu</p>
<p>Gu Yulin Xiao Shaoneng 0-3 Hong Kong</p>
<p>Sun Kun Xiao Youqiu 0-3 Hong Kong</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Cables Three Provinces and Cities, Authorizing Middle School Students to Visit</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 15th) The Ministry of Education cabled the education departments of Beijing, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces and cities on the 15th, authorizing secondary schools and above in areas with convenient transportation to Shanghai to allow students to travel to Shanghai in groups between the 16th and 20th to visit the National Games for educational purposes. Furthermore, preferential fare arrangements have been agreed upon by the Ministries of Education and Railways, with group tickets for 20 or more costing only one-quarter of the original price. Special trains may be arranged if necessary. The Beijing Railway Bureau has scheduled two special trains to transport 6,000 students to Shanghai on the evening of the 17th.</p>
<h3>Zhengtai Factory Presents Footwear and Basketball Championship Teams with Silverware</h3>
<p>The Zhengtai Rubber Factory on Dalian Wan Road in this city is renowned for its high-quality products. Many athletes from various regions at this National Games are wearing their "Warrior" brand athletic shoes. Recognizing this, the factory has specially crafted two genuine silver machine-engraved silver trophies for the championship football and basketball teams. These trophies are currently on display in the window of the China Underwear Company on the west end of Nanjing Road, for public viewing.</p>

<h3>Long-Distance Phone Night Rate Reduction Measures</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Prices will be 30% Lower Than Day Rates</p>
<p>—Effective December 1st—</p>
<p>When the pricing system for long-distance calls between Beijing and Shanghai was changed to a three-minute system, some users misunderstood and expressed dissatisfaction with the changes. After the journalist clarified it in the previous edition of this publication, they likely understood the change. In the countries of Europe and America, there are specific night rates for long distance calls in order to allow for people to make use of the phone during the day. The Ministry of Transportation created a similar measure and designed the Long-Distance Phone Night Rate Reduction Measure and designated Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Zhenjiang, Wujin, Wuxi, Wuxian, and seven other locations for a trial run and will be implemented starting December 1st. If this is successful, they will spread the use further. All prices will be at a 30% discount from day rates. These times run from 8 PM to 6 AM of the next day. This period is usually used by news agencies for distributing their media reports, showing the support from the Ministry of Transportation for news organizations.</p>
<p>Over the recent years, the telegraphy business operated by the Ministry of Transportation has had the slogan, "cooperate with the masses" as the first priority. The public can give opinions, and if the Transportation Department finds these claims to be useful, they are likely to use them to improve the system and satisfy public demand. The creation of a night rate is a testament to the spirit of cooperation. If these procedures, sincerity and understanding were not enacted, and instead only surmised through speech, then that would hinder the transport policies, which would cause a problem for leaders within society.</p>
<h3>Meaning Behind the Ministry of Transportation's Tibetan Telegraphy Code</h3>
<p>— Qinghua</p>
<p>Recently, the Ministry of Transportation, at the request of Gesang Tsering, a survey specialist from the Gan Qing and Kang provinces, developed a Tibetan telegraphy code, to facilitate the transmission of telegraphs in the Kang-Tibetan region. This code was publicly tested on the 7th of this month in Nanjing, and the results were very good. They soon will be formally adopted by the telegraph offices of the Kang-Tibetan region. We should not disregard the creation of this code for the fact that it might not be related to the majority of our nation, but the code itself is very important for these three reasons:</p>
<p>(1) Improved Transmission of Telegraphic Text: Telegraphs are the most useful means of communication and its mission is to transmit text from one place to another. In order for telegraphs to be, "fast and simple", telegraphic symbols must be able to directly transmit text. The languages of Europe, America and Japan are mostly comprised of alphabets and letters. To telegraph this, all one would need to do is assign each telegraphic symbol to each letter, and all that is left is the transcription of the message. But Chinese language is made up of 5 forms: Han, Manchu, Mongolian, Hui, and Tibetan. Among them, Han text is most often used, but it's format is completely different from western text and cannot use symbols to transmit text letter by letter, so they had to use four numerical codes to represent each character. This means each telegraph must be translated twice to transmit the text and greatly reduces the efficiency of the telegraph which is a detriment! Because Tibetan language is organized similar to western alphabets, with the exception being that the alphabets usually have different symbols added to the tops and bottoms of the characters, with forty-two letters and a total of seventeen symbols, with a total of fifty-nine letters and symbols. Compared to Roman letters, these are a whole multiple more, but still within the telegraph system, a telegraph symbol can barely be assigned to each of the fifty-nine Tibetan alphabets and symbols to reach the goal of directly transmitting text, opening a new chapter within the history of Chinese telegraphs! (Using phonetic symbols or the Romanized national pronunciation system for Chinese text can allow for direct transmission and is something that will soon be tested)</p>
<p>(2) Facilitating Kang-Tibetan Public Communications: Remote areas that border other countries usually have very simple communication structures. In recent years, the government has slowly been paying attention, and the communication stations of Lhasa, Tibet, as well as Kangding, Ba'an, Ganzi and Dege in Xikang have been founded at different times. But the people that make use of these lines of communication are still few in number. This is mostly due to the fact that the populace has not developed much as well as the fact that telegraphs cannot transmit Tibetan text. (Most Kang-Tibetan government or religious organizations often create temporary codes to allow for the transmission of Tibetan text, but the common folk do not have the means to translate this telegraphy as well as the fact that communication stations often do not have official translations so the people cannot use the telegraphy.) After adopting the Tibetan telegraphy system, communication stations can receive and transmit Tibetan telegraphic messages, allowing for the people of the Kang-Tibetan region to benefit from using the telegraph. The benefits are apparent during the times where communication is difficult and the amount of postal routes is rare!</p>
<p>(3) To Unite the Kang-Tibetan Region and Fortify National Defense: Since the Xuantong Emperor of the Qing Dynasty's dethronement, our country has often been titled a republic of the five ethnicities, but in reality, the Han ethnicity takes the majority of roles within government. Over the last twenty years, the Manchu, Mongolian, Hui and Tibetan compatriots may not have experienced conspicuous discrimination, but they have been left to the devices of their own lives. The central government should work towards unity and take this opportunity to develop the Kang-Tibetan transport and communication networks to allow for all provinces and cities in the Kang-Tibetan region to communicate with ease to promote solidarity! The development of Kang-Tibetan transport, both economically and time-wise, should focus on the development of telegraphy and communication, because the opening of roadways and the construction of railroads take a lot of money and time, but establishing telegraphic routes is an easier feat. Establishing new communication stations within the Kang-Tibetan region would not only connect each region within the Kang-Tibetan region, but allow for those provinces and cities to connect with ease and remove alienation. In the future, the Tibetan telegraph will be open for the public to allow for quick and easy access to information, which will allow for those in the Tibetan region to understand that the national government is prioritizing the regions to increase their unity. This shows another one of the meanings behind the creation of the Tibetan telegraphy code!</p>
<h3>Can Multiple Destination Names Be Included in One Telegram?</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Please Note and Correct this, Governmental and Military Institutions</p>
<p>According to regulations, each telegram should only have one destination name. If there are two return telegrams to be sent to two different places, then it should be treated the same as two separate telegrams and written separately. Absolutely, it's prohibited to put two destination names in one telegram. The reason is simple: telegrams are like postal letters. Would you write two addresses on one letter and ask the post office to send it to two different recipients? Surely, anyone would answer: "No, you can't." If that's the case for postal mail, why should telegrams be any different! This is easy to understand for anyone with common sense.</p>
<p>However, governmental and military institutions have traditionally followed this practice of listing multiple destination names in one telegram, then submitting it to the telegraph office to be sent to recipients in various locations. This type of telegram often causes unexpected disputes and unavoidable errors for the telegraph office. For example, the recent sensational case in Wu-hu involving a rice merchant suing the telegraph office (details can be found in issue 43 of this publication) occurred because the sending agency—the Anhui Provincial Government—included multiple destination names in one telegram, leading to misunderstandings along the way by the receiving telegraph office—the Wuhu Bureau—and ultimately, to a strange lawsuit. If the sending agency had sent the multiple destination names separately, there would have been no misunderstanding or delay! Of course, until governmental and military institutions change this habit, such misunderstandings may occur at any time. Needless to say, this is a significant loss for both the telegraph office and the governmental and military institutions.</p>
<p>Besides the misunderstandings mentioned above, telegrams with multiple destinations are also prone to being missed or resent by relaying telegraph offices. The routing of telegrams often changes due to circuit obstructions. As a result, when relaying offices encounter telegrams with multiple destinations, they often assume that a particular destination should be relayed by a specific office and that no further action is needed. However, if that particular office happens to have a circuit obstruction, the telegram may be missed. Conversely, some particularly cautious offices may resend telegrams that should have been relayed by another office, leading to double sending. This is another unavoidable error on the part of the telegraph office, which can have unfavorable results for governmental and military institutions.</p>
<p>In reality, it doesn't take much effort for the sending agency to use carbon paper to make multiple copies of the telegram. If the nature of the announcement requires that a certain location be informed while simultaneously notifying other locations, it can be clearly stated in the telegram or indicated with a designated marker without any difficulty. I believe that once the authorities in governmental and military institutions understand the pros and cons mentioned above, they will be able to cooperate effectively with the telegraph office, quickly make corrections, and usher in a new era for official and military telegrams.</p>
<h3>A Visit to the Temporary Telegraph Office at the National Games</h3>
<p>— Wei Li</p>
<p>The highly anticipated Sixth National Games opened on October 10th at the stadium in the center of Shanghai!</p>
<p>Spectators from home and abroad flocked to Shanghai to watch the National Games. The number reached at least hundreds of thousands!</p>
<p>However, countless numbers of compatriots at home and abroad who were unable to come to Shanghai are eagerly awaiting news of the event!</p>
<p>We know that telegrams are the quickest and most accurate way to transmit news about the games!</p>
<p>To promote sports, the Ministry of Transportation has established a temporary telegraph office at the venue. I visited the office and was warmly received by Mr. Zhao Cuiru, the director. Here is a brief record of what I saw to share with our readers!</p>
<p>The temporary telegraph office at the National Games venue is located at number 3, on the right side of the west gate hall. As I walked through the west gate of the National Games venue, I saw the blue and white enamel signs for the "Shanghai Telegraph Office Temporary Receiving and Sending Station" and the "Temporary Post Office." The post office and telegraph office were combined in a double-bay room. The counter was just inside the door, with the post office occupying one-third of the space on the left and the telegraph office occupying two-thirds. Behind the counter was the telegraph room, equipped with the latest machines, including a Creed Keyboard, which can send 300 to 350 letters per minute; a Wheatstone Perforator, which can send 130 to 150 letters per minute; a Teleprinter, which allows direct sending and receiving of letters without pre-perforated paper, operating similarly to a regular typewriter, with a sending and receiving speed of 250 to 300 letters per minute; and a Wheatstone Transmitter-Receiver, which can send and receive 450 to 600 letters per minute.</p>
<p>It is said that the office sends out hard news about the Games to 21 different places every day, amounting to hundreds of thousands of words. Other soft news, news from various newspapers, private telegrams, and social telegrams number in the hundreds. The level of activity is conceivable! All national direct lines can be connected to the office by the Shanghai Telegraph Office for direct reporting. As a result, the speed at which news from the venue is transmitted is unparalleled! News from the Games can be sent to all parts of the country at any time. In addition to the director, the office has three receiving operators, two decoding operators, seven sending operators, and three messengers, who can promptly deliver telegrams to athletes at various venues. All incoming and outgoing telegrams can be processed with maximum speed and accuracy.</p>
<p>The office is open daily from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., for 12 hours. Customers at the counter are constantly sending telegrams, creating a scene as busy as the road to Shanyin. There is a preferential rate for athletes, who can send social telegrams for only 40 cents per telegram, or 20% of the original price, which is cheaper than airmail. Because telegrams are sent and delivered quickly, athletes from various provinces and cities often use the office to report their whereabouts, daily life, sports news, and to thank relatives and friends for their congratulations. Spectators at the Games also crowd the office to send congratulatory telegrams to the athletes. When I visited, the staff were working diligently, their heads buried in their work. The sound of the machines and the sound of paper echoed the cheers from the venue, creating a kind of natural music that was pleasant to hear! I heard that the female swimmers on one team received the most social congratulatory telegrams from the audience. This shows that the people of our country have a deep understanding of the importance of promoting sports at the National Games and that they are using telegrams to avoid the hassle of writing letters, which is a great step forward in our lives! Spectators entering and exiting the venue always stop to look and praise the progress of the telecommunications industry, which has indeed become increasingly convenient for the public! After my visit, I felt that the office had set a model for a combined post and telegraph office, and that it was working hard to serve the athletes and the public faithfully. No wonder it had earned a good impression from the public! With that, I bid farewell and left.</p>

<h3>The Situation of Telegraphs in England and the United States and the Reasons for Their Development</h3>
<p>— Li Jiqing</p>
<p>Having served in various transportation agencies and telegraph offices in China for seventeen or eighteen years, I have a great interest in telegraphs and consider it my lifelong career. At the end of last year, I was sent to the United States to study and investigate in various telegraph and wireless companies for more than eight months. I made a detailed study of the telegraph situation in the United States. Later, I went to Canada to investigate the telegraph companies and learned about their operations. In August of this year, I went from New York to London and then visited the General Post Office of the United Kingdom, the Eastern Telegraph Company, and the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company to observe and investigate. In early November, I will go to Copenhagen, Denmark, to observe the Great Northern Telegraph Company. In the future, when I return to China via Germany, Belgium, France, and Italy, I plan to visit various telegraph and wireless companies along the way to learn about everything. Now, I will describe the situation of newspaper management and the reasons for its development in the United States and the United Kingdom, as follows, for the reference of those in China who are concerned about the telegraph business:</p>
<p>(1) The United States</p>
<p>In the United States, all kinds of businesses are commercial, and the government is in a supervisory position and does not participate in management. The telegraph industry is no exception and is operated by private individuals who raise shares. Under this principle, there are many private telegraph and wireless companies in the United States, such as Western Union Telegraph Company, Postal Telegraph Company, Radio Corporation of America, Machay Radio Company, Commercial Pacific Cable Company, All America Cable Company, and Glcbe Wiieless Company, etc. All of them send and receive various telegrams and compete for business. As a result of their competition, the methods are novel, and the use of telegrams is widespread among the public. However, since the competition among the companies is fierce, there are often conflicts in business methods and telegram prices, which are not beneficial to all parties. If this situation continues, it may have a major impact on the entire telegraph industry in the United States in the future. Therefore, the United States government is aware of this and has convened a meeting of representatives from various companies in Washington to discuss remedies, so that the companies do not engage in excessive competition, which will affect the entire telegraph industry in the United States. If necessary, the government will exercise control and may even consider merging the companies.</p>
<p>Although the various telegraph and wireless companies in the United States are usually operated commercially, according to United States law, all companies are managed and uniformly directed by the government during wartime. At ordinary times, the companies do not easily allow outsiders to enter, in order to prevent the leakage of telegram messages. The United States government has promulgated laws to restrict this, and all companies must strictly abide by them.</p>
<p>The buildings, equipment, and machines used by the various telegraph and wireless companies in the United States are all very perfect and new. Although there are many companies, they all have considerable income from telegraph fees. Therefore, in addition to various expenses, there is still surplus money to seek their development. If the equipment is not good and the machines are old, it will be difficult for any company to survive in this fierce competition.</p>
<p>(2) The United Kingdom</p>
<p>The telegraph business in the United Kingdom is the same as in China, and is operated by the government. The agency in charge is the General Post Office, which is like the Ministry of Transportation in China. Therefore, the postal, telegraph, and telephone businesses in the United Kingdom are all handled by the General Post Office. However, there is also a commercially operated telegraph and wireless company in the United Kingdom that handles international telegrams. This company is called Cable and Wireless Co. The Great Eastern Telegraph Company, which is related to the history of telegraph administration in China, is part of this company. The company is supervised by the government and is in close contact with the General Post Office, exchanging telegrams with each other. In addition, there are branches of the American Western Union Telegraph Company, the Commercial Cable Company, and the Danish Great Northern Telegraph Company in London and elsewhere. However, these companies are only limited to sending and receiving international telegrams and are subject to various legal restrictions of the American government.</p>
<p>The telegraph business in the United Kingdom is also very developed. Although it is government-run, the business methods used are very commercial and public-oriented. Its equipment and everything else are comparable to those of the telegraph companies in the United States. However, the British national character is slightly more conservative, so some equipment does not seem as new as that of the American companies. A few years ago, the British General Post Office sent people to the United States to investigate and study the various companies, and then followed suit. Therefore, the business situation is generally the same as in the United States. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>The Significance of Inspecting Broadcast Radio Receivers</h3>
<p>— Chu</p>
<p>It has been almost two months since the Ministry of Transportation issued an order for local telegraph offices to send personnel to inspect broadcast radio receivers. I heard that most radio owners in various places understand the truth of the matter and allow the inspection without any difficulty. However, there are also quite a few who do not know the details and have doubts, so they make excuses to refuse. This has hindered the progress of this work. Now, I will briefly explain why the Ministry of Transportation wants to inspect radio receivers in various places, in order to make the public understand the truth of the matter and dispel their doubts.</p>
<p>As far as I know, the purpose of the Ministry of Transportation's order for local telegraph offices to inspect radio receiver users is nothing more than the following two points: First, it is for the safety of users. Since the Ministry of Transportation is responsible for managing the national broadcast telecommunications industry, it should do its best to ensure the safety of the public who listen to broadcast telecommunications. Because it is aware that most radio users have no knowledge of electricity, they often install antennas arbitrarily, often near telephone, telegraph, lamp, and other power lines. Or the antennas introduced into the house are not equipped with lightning arresters, so they often disrupt communications or cause dangers such as electric lights and antennas getting tangled. For example, two months ago, a family surnamed a certain name in Nanjing's Fengfu Alley had an incident where the antenna and the light were tangled together. Fortunately, it was discovered early and did not cause a major disaster. Therefore, when the radio inspectors from various telegraph offices inspect, they pay attention to whether the installation of the antenna is appropriate and whether the antenna lead-in line is safe. If there are any problems, they will immediately provide guidance and corrections to avoid danger. Second, it is to prevent radio users from setting up private radio stations. Those who install broadcast radio receivers are often of mixed quality, and there are inevitably some unscrupulous elements who operate for personal gain and take advantage of the registration method for broadcast radio receivers to try to be clever. On the surface, they report the installation of a radio receiver to deceive the public, but secretly, they are stealing the day and changing the sun, setting up private radio stations to engage in secret communications, in order to undermine the state-run telecommunications industry. Therefore, it is necessary to send personnel to each household to inspect one by one whether the installed equipment is consistent with the registered equipment, whether there have been any changes to the internal installation, and whether it is used for sending or talking, in order to prevent abuses. From this point of view, the Ministry of Transportation's implementation of radio receiver inspection is on the one hand to ensure the safety of users, and on the other hand to protect the state-run telegraph business. The purpose is very pure and simple, and it is only beneficial and not harmful to users.</p>
<p>As for this kind of inspection work, it has already been stipulated in Article 4 of the Provisional Regulations for the Registration of Broadcast Radio Receivers, and it is not a temporary issuance. All personnel engaged in this inspection work are technical personnel with rich knowledge of telecommunications, their attitude is amiable, and they handle things quickly and efficiently. There will never be any disturbance to the public. Moreover, when they go out to perform their duties, they wear badges with them for identification. They fulfill their obligations and never ask for a single cent. After reading this article, I hope that radio users in various places can understand the meaning of the Ministry of Transportation's implementation of radio receiver inspection, and in the future, when personnel from various telegraph offices come to inspect, they can trust each other sincerely and no longer have any doubts in their minds!</p>
<h3>The Reduction of Telephone Charges in England</h3>
<p>— Reporter</p>
<p>It is reported that telephone rates in England will be substantially reduced from October 1st, under conditions that permit. The quarterly fee for local lines in London will be reduced from one pound, twelve shillings, and six pence to six shillings. And the fee for various places (except Glasgow, Birmingham, Liverpool, and Manchester) was previously one pound, seven shillings, and six pence, now reduced to one pound. The price of group business and sales is also reduced considerably.</p>
<p>The loss from the above telephone price reduction is about 750,000 pounds in the current year and about 1.5 million pounds in the next year, but it is generally believed that this policy will not only enable the development of telephone services, help commercial prosperity, but also achieve significant benefits and increase telephone revenue.</p>

<h3>The Period of Interruption of the Shanghai-Nagasaki Submarine Cable</h3>
<p>— Suo Yi</p>
<p>The submarine cable from Shanghai to Nagasaki was interrupted on September 15th and was only repaired by a ship after ten days.</p>
<p>The so-called cable is to sink a conductor that conducts electricity into the vast ocean, with the ends landing on the shore and entering the bureau, so as to communicate. Occasionally, obstacles occur, and the repair work is very troublesome. First, it must be measured to know the place where the obstacle occurred, and then a cable repair ship must be sent to the sea to repair it. When it is cloudy and rainy or there are storms, the repair work is even more difficult to carry out. Therefore, the interruption of submarine cables spanning the ocean causes considerable losses to the telegraph office. But once the interruption occurs, the telegram is not available, and merchants suffer greatly.</p>
<p>How to connect the reports from Shanghai to Nagasaki or other places in Japan during the Shanghai-Nagasaki cable interruption is worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>The Shanghai International Telegraph of the Ministry of Transportation has a direct line to Tokyo, so the international telegraph can undertake this work and remedy the shortcomings of the above-mentioned cable. It is not afraid of strong winds and heavy rains, not afraid of high mountains and ridges, and there is no worry about cable interruption. It can communicate 24 hours a day. When a merchant sends a telegram, the international radio station immediately sends out radio waves. Radio waves are like the air on the earth, which are everywhere. It can be immediately transmitted to the other end of the communication, and then it can be received as a report.</p>
<p>During the Shanghai-Nagasaki cable interruption period, telegrams from Shanghai to Nagasaki that were previously transmitted via the cable were all sent to the International Radio Station for transmission. Usually, the International Radio uses one transmitter for sending and one receiver for receiving. Because of the Shanghai-Nagasaki cable interruption, the incoming and outgoing reports were unusually crowded, so two large-capacity transmitters were opened to undertake the sending work, and two receiving buildings were used to undertake the receiving work. Therefore, during the cable interruption period, because the International Radio Station's equipment was perfect, the merchants not only had no delay, but also, on the contrary, it was faster!</p>

<h3>The Anti-Slavery Movement</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>Recently, I heard that the Hong Kong Anti-Slavery Society has scheduled an anti-slavery movement publicity week from the 14th to the 20th. The declaration was issued the day before yesterday, requesting all social organizations, newspapers, churches, schools, etc. to work together to eliminate the slavery system. This move is extremely gratifying.</p>
<p>Slavery is very common in our country. Most families above the middle class use maids. The reason is that the average wealthy person has a comfortable life, and of course he is unwilling to do all the housework himself, and he needs someone to act as an agent. They keep one or two maids at home for their use. All daily chores in the home are assigned to the maids. Being a maid is really a hard life. Getting up early and resting late every day, they are so busy that they don't even have time to catch their breath. This kind of life of cattle and horses and slaves often completely destroys the life of a maid.</p>
<p>There is another difficulty in being a maid, that is, sometimes she is abused by the owner. Every time I see a group of people who are masters, their treatment of maids is simply not human, and they are cruel in every way. If anything is slightly unsatisfactory, they will be stern and abusive, and those with vicious hearts will even inflict inhuman tortures. It is not uncommon in society for maids to be injured or killed by abuse. Not long ago, a case of a young lady abusing a maid occurred in Tianjin, and recently a similar incident has been noisy in Shanghai. This is just an example, and there are countless similar facts.</p>
<p>Slavery is a kind of slavery system. Here we don't want to raise issues such as equality between men and women or the personality of women. What we doubt is, to what extent has human civilization progressed today, is there any reason for the existence of this system? What's more, slavery is a kind of trafficking in human beings, which violates both humanity and laws. In general, families keep maids, and they are all redeemed or bought with money. A group of poor people, due to family difficulties, often redeem or sell their daughters to wealthy people as maids. Under this circumstance, the maid becomes a commodity, and her unfortunate experience is even more pitiful. Therefore, we believe that the slavery system should be abolished.</p>
<p>As for the slavery system, what methods are needed to abolish it? On the active side, the government authorities should enact a law to ban people from keeping maids, and those who violate it will be punished. On the passive side, we must first start with rescuing maids. The establishment of a system has its historical relationship, and it is not easy to overthrow it for a while. Therefore, before the slavery system can be fundamentally prohibited, the society must show sympathy for the maids and try to change their attention. A maid rescue center should also be established to accommodate maids who are unwilling to be maids or who have been abused, so that they can escape the status of slaves. The anti-slavery movement is even more necessary. Like this anti-slavery movement held by the Hong Kong Anti-Slavery Society, its significance is significant, and all parties should work hard to support it, so as to achieve the goal of eliminating the maid system.</p>
<h3>Terror</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Random Notes on Returning Home</p>
<p>I have finally arrived home.</p>
<p>In the evening, under the somewhat bright lamplight (I guess the lamp is only lit on New Year's Eve?), I scrutinized the old house with sensitive eyes, that old ancestral shrine, that paint-peeled long bench, and the faded spring couplets. Like my father, they had all weathered the storms of human existence and had grown old. The two street doors were tightly shut, which made me recall the scene from ten years ago. At that time, the spacious open space outside the door must have been filled with the songs of children, and the adults would have been waving fans, chatting idly with neighbors. But now, there was only a dead silence outside, not a single sound of happy children's songs could be heard. Who could believe such a drastic change?</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>After everyone dispersed, the lamps were also extinguished. The frosty moonlight bathed the eaves, and autumn insects chirped incessantly, singing songs unknown to humans. The flame of the small sesame oil lamp on the table flickered in the wind, casting a large and blurry shadow on the wall opposite my aged father's face. Finally, he spoke in a low and feeble voice:</p>
<p>"The village is getting worse year by year. You should also support your younger siblings. It's really impossible to live here anymore!" I was about to ask, but he started coughing dryly. I hurriedly poured him a cup of tea. Then, he continued:</p>
<p>"For example, Yi Sheng..." He coughed again. The family hadn't used pork lard for cooking in a long time, but tonight they made an exception, so he coughed especially hard.</p>
<p>"Yi Sheng's fate is still unknown. He was taken to the county by the defense corps almost a year ago because the construction of the highway occupied his land, and he wasn't compensated. Alas, land is the life of a farmer..." He paused, but I couldn't say a word. "Yi Sheng's wife is suffering enough now, with four children, two of whom are daughters, all just freeloaders who can't do any work. Last year, they planted tangerines, hoping to sell them for a bit more money to pay off their debts. Little did they know that after a year of careful tending, they ended up selling three tangerines for the price of one. I heard it's because the cannery closed down. Alas, these days, it's really..."</p>
<p>He took a sip of tea. In the silence, the empty hall felt even more eerie. I listened blankly, and the face of an honest, rural farmer flooded my mind, so kind, so amiable, but now his fate is unknown...</p>
<p>"Now there are also more bandits. Some only kidnap people with status, while others only oppose the defense corps. Some homicides often occur at night. You shouldn't stay at home for too long!"</p>
<p>As my father spoke, I felt as if I were sitting in a movie theater. Before my eyes, those desolate people, faces ravaged by wind and rain, swollen eyes, and chests and lungs as hard as iron; also, ruined homes, ruined fields, ruined Tung tree orchards, familiar and unfamiliar, all rushed past my eyes, along with fire, blood, wailing, and shouting, and...</p>
<p>Suddenly, we noticed that the barking of dogs grew louder and closer, from sparse to dense, from low to high. We listened carefully, intently. It was clear that something had happened! My father hurriedly stood up, trembling all over.</p>
<p>"Xuan, Xuan, hurry... quickly...!" He just trembled, unable to finish his sentence.</p>
<p>The footsteps grew closer and were very noisy. I quickly turned off the small lamp with my hand.</p>
<p>Someone knocked on the door! My father pulled me aside and asked in a trembling voice:</p>
<p>"Who is it?"</p>
<p>"It's me, sir... Not asleep yet, huh? Cough! Cough!..."</p>
<p>"Are you Gei Yu?" My father's voice was a bit louder now. "Come in and have a cup of tea. Is there any news outside?"</p>
<p>"I still have official duties. I heard that the third young master has returned. I think it's best for him to go somewhere else tonight. The corps headquarters just called and said that things are very tight outside. Cough... Cough," he said as he coughed, then turned to leave.</p>
<p>"Ah!" My father sighed, unable to speak for a long time. We listened quietly as their footsteps faded away before slowly sitting down.</p>
<p>"Let's rest for a bit and discuss it tomorrow. Let's spend the night in the grass shed tonight. I think that's a bit safer," my father said.</p>
<p>I had no choice but to listen to him, lighting a lantern and walking into the mountains. The wind blowing against my face carried the scent of soil, along with the intoxicating fragrance of rice. The countryside was very quiet. Only the barking of dogs drifted from afar, interspersed with one or two gunshots, which were the signals of the night watchmen. An endless expanse of wilderness was covered with a layer of frosty moonlight. In the moonlight, I vaguely saw a huge watchtower in the distance, half swallowed by darkness. This didn't exist ten years ago. Ten years ago, children would have been carrying small lanterns in the fields, catching crickets and fireflies.</p>
<h3>Is Dancing One More Time Saving One More Life?</h3>
<p>— Written by Chen Jingsheng</p>
<h3>Before the Grave</h3>
<p>— Hu Weixiong</p>
<p>It was the child's first anniversary.</p>
<p>The night before, I deliberately invited my wife to see a movie. The movie was a comedy. My intention was to use external stimuli to make my wife forget that unforgettable day. After leaving the cinema, we didn't take a car. We walked home slowly. On the way, I mentioned the film we had seen before with the same actor, and I told many of their unique jokes. My wife seemed very happy, and she did not mention anything about the child. It was already midnight when we got home,</p>
<p>but my wife did not forget the date of the child's anniversary. She said sadly: This is the first year, and we should go to his grave. He is waiting for me! As she said this, she almost shed tears. Maternal love is innate, and my wife especially liked children. Regardless of other people's or her own children, she would always snatch them to hold them. When she told me she was pregnant, I had never seen her so happy. She bought many books on prenatal hygiene and followed the rules in the books every day. At the same time, she was busy cutting and sewing children's clothes, making children's supplies, as if she lived for the children.</p>
<p>She fell ill after giving birth, but as instructed by the parenting knowledges, she opposed hiring a wet nurse. She took the responsibility of raising the child and did not resign to hard work. When the child was learning to speak, my wife nervously interpreted his "咿啞咿啞" sounds into various languages. Occasionally, when she heard a sound like "Mama," she would tell people that my child could speak...</p>
<p>But last autumn, on a drizzly night, the child passed away without getting to say her last words. She neglected sleep and food, and she craved the child almost madly. She collected the child's clothes and toys in a small cabinet. Every day, she imitated this and that like a madman and said to herself, "This is the child's..." She often woke up in the middle of the night and told me that the child had returned; although she knew it was a dream, she always explained to me in detail where she saw the child, or how the child treated her, as if it were true, until she was exhausted and could not support herself, then she continued to sleep.</p>
<p>I also loved the child. When the child suddenly passed away from an illness, I felt a sense of loss in my heart. But in order to relieve my wife's depression, I forced a smile and persuaded her. Every holiday, I rejected my friends' greetings and accompanied my wife to the countryside to broaden her mind, or watched slapstick movies, suppressed my own emotions, and gradually woke my wife up from her grief.</p>
<p>Recently, although she always misses seeing other people's children, she is no longer so stubborn. She accepted the doctor's advice. If she becomes ill from depression, she will never have children again! Her daily life and diet have returned to the right track as before she had children. She collected all the child's relics and hid them in a hidden place. She said: I want to forget the child from now on</p>
<p>But she did not forget the child's anniversary. We bought a bunch of flowers to go to his grave. The autumn morning was high-pitched and lonely. The sharp morning wind brushed, making the grave even more desolate. We stood side by side in front of the child's grave, and my wife couldn't help but cry out loud, as if she had suffered some grievance. I stood blankly. I did not shed tears. I could strongly stop the release of emotions, and I didn't stop my wife from crying her heart out. Otherwise, she would miss the child and become ill.</p>
<p>When the sun occasionally explored its rays, I turned back and patrolled the entire cemetery. The dew condensed on each tombstone, reflecting golden light, as if each smiling face was sleeping peacefully in the tomb. Every soul in the cave has already forgotten the pain of the world, right? I told my wife this meaning, and she raised her head and said: My eye sockets also reflect golden light</p>
<h3>The Lame Beggar</h3>
<p>— Yafei</p>
<p>He lies at the bottom of this dilapidated watchtower every day. For more than twenty years, no one has ever seen him leave. This rickety old body, however, has never been sick, perhaps because "the blind wild boar is taken care of by heaven."</p>
<p>This watchtower is right next to my house. He often comes to my house to beg for leftovers. He also helps us watch the door. When guests come, he replies for us, or asks the names of the visitors, and he knows almost all of our relatives or friends.</p>
<p>Begging is different from other begging. He doesn't carry a dog-beating stick when he goes out. He doesn't call people "Madam." He only carries a broken bowl and two bamboo chopsticks to the east and the west. Regardless of whether it is sunny or rainy, spring, summer, autumn, or winter, he is always barefoot. He doesn't know how to sing anything, and he only murmurs words in his mouth, like chanting Buddhist scriptures or scolding people, and he doesn't even know what he is praying for. If there is a celebration in the village in front today, or a funeral in the alley behind tomorrow, even if people don't notify him, he will definitely come to the celebration or funeral no matter how far or near it is, whether it is sunny or rainy, he will definitely arrive on time. Naturally, half a cup of leftovers and a bowl of cold rice, people will never let him down.</p>
<p>I really wanted to find out about his life, but when I asked him, he always seemed blank and didn't know how to answer. Once, my grandmother came to my house and told me some stories about him.</p>
<p>Many years ago, a small fishing boat came to the harbor in front of our door. The owner of the boat was a middle-aged couple. They fished, caught shrimp, and dug silt for others to make a living here. After a year, a white and chubby child was added to the boat.</p>
<p>When the child was about ten years old, one summer, the couple contracted a plague at the same time and died, leaving the child behind; thus, he became a poor child without parents. Soon, the small fishing boat also sank to the bottom of the water because it was old and no one took care of it.</p>
<p>The child had no relatives or dependents. He was so young, and he didn't know how to make a living, so he relied on the leftovers of others to live. He slept under this watchtower at night, and now it has been more than fifty years.</p>
<p>When he walked into this watchtower, this watchtower was still new, and the owner of this alley was a prominent court official at the time. Now, the descendants of the prominent officials are unknown, and the owner of the alley has been replaced by a businessman. But he still stays there, although the watchtower has been dilapidated, it can still shelter him from wind and rain.</p>
<p>As for his lame leg, it was thirty years ago, because there was a theft in the alley, those arrogant servants suspected him, and they tortured him with private punishment to force him to confess. One of his legs was crippled by them! When the truth came out, it was discovered that the main culprit of the theft was not him, but the owner's nephew, but Chu was already disabled. Hearing my grandmother talk about his history, I felt a sense of loss in my heart.</p>

<h3>A Collection of Radio Sounds</h3>
<p>Indeed, I fundamentally lack the ability that the ugly woman said, "Whoever dares to come and fight me for a hundred rounds." At the same time, there is also the peacemaker Mr. Iron Pen. You can really take a break. Even if I am the old Iron Pen, I have to put down my pen. There is really no need to quarrel any more. However, Mr. Iron Pen's kindness and flattery of me are truly appreciated. When you have free time, please bring the whole family to my small shop (No. 48 Penglai Road ×× Coffee Shop) for a big feast. I am "respectfully" waiting. (Copper Thunder)</p>
<p>(Omitted above) Brother Lei: For the sake of your own personality, I have to give you a final piece of advice.</p>
<p>Based on the purpose of "recording everything heard," I wrote "The News of Chen Jingfang's Marriage." Of course, it is impossible to determine whether the rumors are true or not. (Fortunately, Brother Lei even considers the manuscripts with the same signature in the Shishi Xinbao and Xin Yebao to be plagiarism.) If the rumors are false, it is good that she is still around, so she can come out and correct them. (Omitted) However, coming back to the topic, (recording Brother Lei's writing style) how do you know that Mrs. Chen has not married? Please show me the goods!</p>
<p>If you say that a manuscript is submitted twice, one before and one after, then I have to ask for advice again. Is the manuscript published immediately upon arrival? You might as well try running a publication yourself.</p>
<p>I have never seen the comprehensive report on singers. If Brother Lei is willing to be friends with me, please send me a copy so that I can read it.</p>
<p>Finally, today (14th), "Ugly Woman" and "Iron Pen" in this newspaper, as well as the editors of this publication, have explained and brought us together. Here, I say thank you. If Brother Copper Thunder does not hesitate to be friends with Soft Feet, you are welcome to come to No. 48 Penglai Market to visit you. Brother Lei, what do you think? (Soft Feet Reply)</p>
<p>For the sake of Chen Jingfang's marriage, such a lot of effort has been put in. The editor is very uneasy. Yesterday, there was a reader who wrote to ask me if "Copper Thunder" was Chen Jingfang himself. I really don't know how to answer! Okay, I hope the two of you can join hands. In this messy singing world, we have a lot of work to do! (Editor)</p>
<p>There is a certain gentleman who is pursuing a certain lady, but the certain lady is ignoring him. The certain gentleman does not blame himself for being too much, but only blames the certain lady for being ruthless.</p>

<h3>Let's Open the Dam Together</h3>
<p>—A Scene from "Triumphant Song"—</p>
<p>"It's been so dry for days. If it doesn't rain in a few more days, won't everything be over? The only way we can do it now is to work together to open the dam. What dragon king is asking for, that's all just nonsense. We can't believe it, we have to know that everything in the world depends on ourselves..."</p>
<p>"Okay, sir! Let's open the dam together."</p>
<p>This is a classroom in a "Peasant Children's Primary School" that has been converted from the Dragon King Temple. Many peasant students have raised their hands in agreement under the drought relief method proposed by teacher Wei Heling.</p>
<p>"If we want to go, we will go now. You go home first and tell your fathers and brothers, call everyone to bring all the dam opening tools to Zhoujiaba to gather..."</p>
<p>After Wei Heling ordered this to the crowd, the crowd cheered and went home to call their fathers and brothers and brought their farm tools. He himself took Wang Yin to Zhoujiaba to survey the location.</p>
<p>This is a scene from "Triumphant Song" directed by Bu Wancang of Yihua Company. Because the atmosphere is very tense and the emotions are very enthusiastic, there is no doubt that it is one of the wonderful performances in "Triumphant Song".</p>
<h3>"Metropolitan Scenery" Two Newcomers — Tang Na Zhang Xinzhu</h3>
<h3>The Premiere of the First Full-Color Stereoscopic Film "Vanity Fair"</h3>
<p>Since the transition of films from silent to sound, there hasn't been such a significant revolution as the so-called "New Color" stereoscopic filming, or New Technicolor. However, the attempt at color films has a long history, and the use of three primary colors to capture images and present them on the screen with pure, natural, clear, and vibrant colors, while also creating a three-dimensional effect due to the deeper parallax, should be praised as the latest and most wonderful gift of science. The American RKO Pictures, due to the unexpected success of the three-primary-color experimental short film "La Cucuracha" last year, which won a special award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and gained unanimous praise from the world, painstakingly selected the famous and romantic novel "Vanity Fair" by the great British writer William Makepeace Thackeray. The story revolves around the romantic life of the heroine Becky Sharp (according to the original name) and incorporates historical traces of the French eccentric Napoleon and the British court to create a drama. They hired the talented superstar Marlene Dietrich to star in it, spending astonishing amounts of money and energy on the creation of a three-color, full-length film. Now that it is premiering in "Nanjing," its sensation is to be expected. However, "Vanity Fair" also bears the mission of the second major transformation of the eighth art, not just as the highest-valued entertainment product in its art.</p>

<h3>Amazing Achievements of Norton Motorcycles</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>Norton motorcycles have always been known for their precision engineering and high speed, renowned worldwide. They have consistently participated in various competitions, invariably ranking among the top and winning championships. According to news received by the local distributor, Billiems Motor Co., from the factory, Norton has once again secured victories in the 1935 Junior and Senior Tourist Trophy races, as well as the Grand Prix races held in Europe. The excellence of their performance is truly astonishing, enviable, and worthy of constant praise.</p>
<p>It is noted that Norton motorcycles have now won the Junior and Senior Tourist Trophy championships for four consecutive years. Therefore, at the beginning of this Junior race, some people doubted whether Norton could maintain its champion status. However, the result was that Norton not only occupied the top three positions but even swept the top four in one stage of the race. As for Mr. Duncan's seventh-place finish, it was due to a crash.</p>
<p>At the end of the first lap, Mr. Guthrie led with an average speed of 78.99 miles per hour. The other three officially participating Norton motorcycles closely followed him. By the second lap, the top four positions were still occupied by these four Nortons, with Mr. Guthrie still leading the pack. At this time, his average speed had reached 79.05 miles per hour. Subsequently, in the third lap, the positions of the cars remained unchanged. However, the most noteworthy point was that Mr. Alerske completed this lap in 28 minutes and 19 seconds, achieving a speed of 80 miles per hour. It should be noted that no other junior class motorcycle has ever been able to reach this speed except for Norton. In the fourth lap, Mr. Duncan unfortunately fell behind due to a crash, as mentioned above. The remaining three Nortons continued to speed like lightning and safely reached the finish line. Their rankings are as follows:</p>
<p>First place: Mr. Guthrie, speed 79.14 miles per hour.</p>
<p>Second place: Mr. Alerske, speed 78.71 miles per hour.</p>
<p>Third place: Mr. Waytt, speed 78.19 miles per hour.</p>
<p>In addition, the team championship was also won by the Norton team. As for the Senior race, which was held for the first time this year, Norton's performance was even more astonishing, with an average speed of 84.65 miles per hour.</p>
<h3>Campbell Returns to England in Triumph</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Achieving the desired 300 miles per hour</p>
<p>The origin of the famous "Blue Bird" car's name</p>
<p>Sir Malcolm Campbell, the world-renowned automobile racer, has recently achieved his ultimate goal of a speed record of 300 miles per hour and returned to England in triumph. Campbell's accurate speed record is 301.292 miles per hour on land. When the race had just finished, due to a timekeeper's error, it was thought that Campbell's speed had not yet reached 300 miles per hour, causing everyone to feel sorry for Campbell, as the failure was so close, but ultimately did not satisfy the baronet's desire. However, officials from the American Automobile Association notified Campbell late at night that there had been a timing error and that he had indeed reached 300 miles per hour. The crowd congratulated Campbell, and the baronet was also sincerely happy, saying that this kind of error was "funny." Campbell's car's speed averaged twelve seconds per mile. Initially, Campbell had planned to try again the day after the race to reach the 300-mile-per-hour target, but after the good news arrived, he immediately canceled the previous plan, packed his bags, and left the United States to return to England. The six-ton, 2,500-horsepower "Blue Bird" car also returned to its homeland.</p>
<p>The timekeeper initially calculated Sir Campbell's southbound speed as 295.566 miles per hour, averaging 299.875 miles per hour, which did not meet the target of 300 miles per hour. Later, after checking the electrical timing paper tape, the return mile was twelve seconds and eight tenths of a second, not twelve seconds and eighteen hundredths of a second. Thus, the initial record was officially announced as incorrect. Sir Campbell is tall and well-built, and his driving skill relies heavily on his physical strength, making him a true driving prodigy. Born in 1885, he initially worked for Lloyd's, in the insurance industry, in 1904, until the outbreak of the Great War, when he left to join the army as an aircraft ferry pilot. However, this was not his ambition. After being demobilized in 1919, he resigned, soon married, and the following year purchased a car to race at Brooklands.</p>
<p>Sir Campbell's wife is also very interested in car racing and can drive. In 1921, Lady Campbell thought that if a woman engaged in car racing, it would definitely attract interest. She told Campbell, "I will personally drive and race to see what kind of interest you find in car racing." A week later, Campbell returned and told his wife, "I have registered you for the car race at Brooklands next Saturday." Lady Campbell thought there was still plenty of time to practice, so she said to her husband, "Then you should lend me your car for practice." Before Saturday, Campbell went out with his wife. Lady Campbell drove two laps, with a speed of 80 miles per hour. Her husband told her that this result was not very good and that it would be very difficult to win the championship. She was very unhappy after this setback. On the day of the race, Lady Campbell, as a result of her efforts, reached a speed of 110 miles per hour and finished fourth. She did not find any fun in racing, so without waiting for her mother and aunt to stop her, she voluntarily decided not to participate in car races anymore. Now, when Sir Campbell drives, she always watches from the sidelines. Although she is not happy to do so, she often attends. Sir Campbell repeatedly tells her not to be afraid, and Lady Campbell also tries her best to do so.</p>
<p>The car that Sir Campbell drove to win the championship is called "Blue Bird." The origin of this name is quite amusing. One day, he bought a car and planned to go to Brooklands to race. That evening, he decided to go to the theater for entertainment. The play being performed was Maeterlinck's "The Blue Bird." Campbell admired this play immensely. The next evening, the night before the race, Campbell went to see it again. After the play ended and he returned, he painted his newly purchased car blue and named it "Blue Bird." On the day of the race, the paint had not yet dried and was dripping, but Campbell did not care and won the first prize. From then on, Campbell named each new car he purchased "Blue Bird" to mark his good luck. The new Blue Bird car used in this race was 28 feet long, and the shape of its tail was very strange. The gas used to start it up almost caused people to become mute, and those who smelled it suffocated, like the smell of trinitrotoluene when it explodes.</p>
<p>The tires used on the car were repeatedly tested beforehand to see if they could withstand the intense friction of 300 miles per hour. No less than forty tires were tested, with dimensions of 37 by 8, using ten to twelve layers of silk and canvas lining, with a thin rubber surface on the outside. All the equipment and methods used in the race were in accordance with the regulations of the American Automobile Association's racing group. The finish line had a red bullseye. When the "Blue Bird's" upward-pointing nose touched the pre-installed metal platform, it would be connected to the judges' platform for the official recording time. The tool for recording time was a current-powered paper tape machine.</p>
<p>After this final race, Sir Campbell will serve as the chief of Central Newsreel for the American Fox Film Corporation. Campbell is often seen in newsreels and should have considerable experience in this field. According to Campbell, the cost of this type of racing is astonishing. Because he inherited a large fortune when he was young, he was able to complete this work. He also said that when the "Blue Bird" is running, steering is the most difficult, often causing blisters on the palms of his hands. Campbell's life is dedicated to obtaining land speed records, and car racing is one of his private life's works. Otherwise, he would specialize in treasure hunting. He previously spent one or two years on Cocos Island, excavating gold and silver hidden by pirates in 1821, worth a total of $60,000,000, but was unsuccessful. When he retires to his hometown of Surrey, he will still use driving as a pastime, but his speed will be no more than 50 miles per hour.</p>
<h3>A Car Trip to Northern Zhejiang (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Lingyun</p>
<p>Several Westerners in this city drove a Vauxhall sedan in late August for a week-long trip to northern Zhejiang. They recorded the itinerary and time in great detail. Here is a translation for reference.</p>
<p>On Friday, August 23rd, at 1:30 PM, we set off from St. George's Road in Jing'an Temple for a car trip on the Zhejiang Highway. The car we drove was a 1935 large six-cylinder Vauxhall, with 27 horsepower. The fuel tank was filled with 14 gallons of gasoline, and the odometer reading was 4740 miles. The first 133 miles of the journey, from Shanghai to West Lake in Hangzhou, are known to anyone in this city who has a Chinese car license, so I won't go into detail. However, I will still use a diary format to explain the important locations along the way in order. The readers will want to know the records of the time and itinerary.</p>
<p>We crossed the Xujiahui Bridge from Avenue Dubail in the French Concession. (The speedometer reading was 4742 miles.) At 2:10 PM, we arrived at the Minhang ferry. The road we passed was a cinder surface, rough and uneven. If we only consider this point, it can be said to be the worst road on the entire journey. At 3:00 PM, we arrived at the seawall, and the Zhoushan Islands in Hangzhou Bay were faintly visible. (4776 miles) A quarter of an hour later, the odometer reading was 4787 miles. The stone sign marking the border between Jiangsu and Zhejiang had been passed. From now on, the mileage markers along the road all indicate the distance from Hangzhou.</p>
<p>At 3:40 PM, we arrived at Zhapu. (4800 miles) This place is still a restricted area, and because the seawall is narrow, driving is not easy. There have been dangerous incidents involving Chinese people because they are not used to driving. The second checkpoint where car licenses must be inspected is Haiyan. (Arrived at 4:00 PM, 4811 miles) The inspection place is an ancient temple at a cape. A courteous official directs the operation. In this situation, it is best to present your passport and your business card. Of course, the car license and driver's license should also be presented.</p>
<p>Next is Ganpu, a small town. (It was a large world trade city before 877 AD. It was already famous in Marco Polo's time.) This town is located in a small mountain in the second district, which Shanghai residents pass through on their way to Hangzhou. After a journey of 133 miles, we arrived at West Lake in Hangzhou at 6:30 PM. (The odometer reading was 4873 miles.)</p>
<p>The next day, Saturday, we departed from Hangzhou. After filling up with eight gallons of gasoline, we headed to Huizhou via the Qiantang River Bridge at 6:45 AM. (4874 miles) From various maps, it seems that we should be able to see the Qiantang River along the way, but in reality, this is not the case. It is very different from the ideal. However, several places we passed through have excellent scenery. There are cliffs on both sides, and the road passes through the middle, which shows how difficult the construction was. After passing through scattered tea-growing areas, we arrived at Fuyang at about 7:45 AM. The odometer reading was 4899 miles. At 4904 miles, we saw some small mountains, which were very beautiful. After passing the Songxi River (4913 miles), we took a cliff road and advanced along the Qiantang River. At 9:30 AM, we arrived at Tonglu, with a mileage of 4931 miles. This place has small wooden ferries for crossing the Tongxi River, costing one dollar. However, one must be very careful when getting on and off the ferry because the angle at which the gangplank is placed is often very steep. At 10:00 AM, at a mileage of 4941 miles, we arrived at the branch road to Qililong. After another four miles of driving and one and a half miles of walking, we reached Yanziling Fishing Terrace. This is a famous scenic spot with a history of more than 2,000 years. At 11:30 AM, we returned to the main road with a mileage of 4949 miles. An hour later, we arrived at the Baisha fork in the road. (4749 miles) We proceeded on the road to the right. At 4989 miles, we passed the bus station. The toll for crossing the river thirteen miles ahead is collected here.</p>
<h3>A History of the Diesel Engine (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Zhu Yisheng</p>
<p>If you need to inflate the rubber tires of your bicycle, you will feel the air pump casing getting hot after a few minutes of pumping. This is because the air inside is under high pressure. The diesel engine is based on this principle. When its piston moves upward in the cylinder, the air inside the cylinder is subjected to strong pressure, about 500 to 1200 pounds per square inch. This strongly compressed air also generates heat of 1000 degrees Fahrenheit. At this point, the oil injector pre-installed on the cylinder head injects a mist-like heavy oil. It immediately combusts due to the high-temperature air, explodes, and pushes the piston down, just like a gasoline engine using a spark plug to ignite gasoline.</p>
<p>Because the air pressure inside the cylinder is particularly high, the structure of the cylinder is much stronger than that of ordinary gasoline engines. This is the first difficulty, because the engine itself feels heavy. However, modern metallurgy, using specially made alloys and baking methods, has gradually solved this problem. For example, the Cummins engine only weighs 15.6 pounds per horsepower, which is not much different from the 14.9 pounds per horsepower of ordinary gasoline engines.</p>
<p>The second difficulty is that because the air pressure in the cylinder is too high, it is difficult to start. Ordinary gasoline engines can rotate automatically once they are driven by a motor. However, diesel engines do not need to use electricity at all, so there is no need to install a motor specifically for starting. If you use your hand to crank it, you will not be able to do it. Especially in this modern world, wouldn't it be ridiculous? However, in this era of scientific omnipotence, this problem can naturally be solved easily. For example, springs, cold air, or centrifugal flywheels can be used. Let us wait and see.</p>
<p>In addition, the difficulty lies in the fact that heavy oil is strong and not as supple as gasoline. Gasoline-powered cars are easier to operate comparatively. However, when the weather is cold, the diesel engine is not affected by freezing. This is its characteristic.</p>
<p>Behind today's large-scale manufacturing, there is a strange story. We may as well observe the evolution of the diesel engine step by step.</p>
<p>Sixty-five years ago, there was a blacksmith named Christian Jorgensen in Minneapolis, USA. He can be said to be the ancestor of the diesel engine. He installed two pieces of hardwood on the upper part of the engine cylinder and used a machine twist to make them rub against each other, generating heat and causing the compressed air to burn and explode. However, this engine was only experimental and not practical. A few years later, there was a mineral soil in West Virginia named Uhmlen who came up with the idea of building a coal powder engine. The only difference at that time was that heavy oil was not used. After several years of experimentation, it was quite successful. Unfortunately, the cylinder exploded later, and the inventor unfortunately died of serious injuries.</p>
<p>The diesel engine is named after its inventor, Dr. Rudolf Diesel. His parents were both German, but he was born in Paris, France. He studied science at specialized schools in England and Germany. After graduating, he once managed a refrigeration plant in Paris. In 1883, he used his ingenuity to create a special engine, putting the drawings and calculations on paper. Three years later, the ideal became a reality. However, his engine at that time also used coal powder like Uhmlen. In the end, it also exploded into pieces.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Dr. Diesel did not suffer any major danger. After coming out of the hospital, he planned to use oil instead of coal in his experiments. It was truly successful. At that time, an American businessman named Bushey bought his patent rights in the United States.</p>
<p>Although machine engineers everywhere held bright hopes and enthusiasm for his engine at that time, the cunning wealthy people always took a cold attitude and did not provide assistance. It was not until after his patent expired in 1912 that they showed interest in investing. Dr. Diesel felt the cruelty of the world towards him and threw himself into the English Channel in the year before the European War.</p>
