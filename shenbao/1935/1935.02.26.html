<h3 id="c23">奧總理訪英法與中歐公約 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— 微</p>
<p>今日歐洲之不安。其原因可大别為二。一為凡爾賽條約體系之動摇。一為法意在中歐及巴爾幹方面之争霸。而奧國問題。實與此二者俱有重要之關係者也。</p>
<p>奧國問題久被視為歐洲火山之噴火口。各國謀所以堰止其噴發者已非一日。徒以利害不同。蓄意各異。終無適當之方策。直至本年一月。法總理親訪羅馬。始有法意協定之成立。其重要收穫。即由法意共同聲明。保障奧國之獨立。其後又訪倫敦。有英法協定之擬議。除安全保障問題。軍縮問題外。英國亦將參加有關奧國獨立保障之商議協約。而最近奧總理許希尼格與外長華爾特尼格。同至巴黎。與法總理佛蘭亭外長賴伐爾作重要談話。尤為世人所注目。據昨日哈瓦斯社電稱。二國已成立妥約。除承認法意羅馬協定外。業將中歐公約之原則。予以確定。本日奧總理復動身赴英。探詢英國之意見。使奧總理而不虚此行。能獲得英法意之共同宣言。在政治上保障其獨立。在經濟上援助其復興。則奧國問題當可暫告段落。同時歐洲之局勢亦將因以轉變矣。</p>
<p>奧在戰前本為歐洲之一大國。戰後因受和約之處分。國内膏腴之地全被分割。重要産業又遭蹂躪。重以賠欵之負担。致國家經濟無復自立之能力。財政窘廹異常。非舉外債。難以度日。至有國際乞丐之稱。而一方内亂頻仍。騷擾不絶。去年首相陶爾斐斯被刺。幾引起國際干涉。奧之目前境况。固深為吾人同情者也。</p>
<p>奧之困難。重在經濟。欲謀自救。僅有二途。非與德國合併。即與周圍各國作經濟上之協調。所謂多瑙河聯合是也。德奧合併。不特為奧國所切望亦德國所求之不得者。蓋二國同文同種。處境又同。設能併合。自可打破目前之苦悶。但亦正因此故。不為列張所允許。至於今日。則因德國國社黨之激烈活動。反引起奧國之反感。合併問題。已無實現之可能矣。</p>
<p>其次多瑙河諸邦之聯合。則與法意之争霸有關。法在戰後之外交政策。在於抑德而抗意。故一方要求安全保障。一方力求多樹與國。除小協約各國已受其霸縻外。對於奧國及匈國之向背。自不容忽視。故乘奧國財政窮乏之機。利用自己經濟力之優勢而與之提携。更進而聯合匈國。一九三二年三月所發表之多瑙案。即在使多瑙河諸邦形成經濟一體。雖未成功。然法國之用心。已可概見矣。</p>
<p>意欲掌握亞得利亞海之制海權。由來已久。戰前其敵為奧。戰後則有南斯拉夫起而代之。南斯拉夫為小恊約之一。小協約之後又隱有法國。故事實上意南之争。即為法意之争。法樹與國。意亦不得不拉攏亞爾巴尼亞保加利亞等以與法抗。而對於奧匈二國自又力求聯絡。此所以去年三月有意奧匈三國協定之成立也。</p>
<p>是故奧國問題為德法意三國之争。法意二國不願見奧國之合併於德。亦不願奧之為對方所利用。故迄無適當之處置辦法。惟今則因一致對德之故。英法意見既就一致。法意關係亦見好轉。奧國之獨立。可由三國共同保障。多瑙河聯合。亦遂有成立之可能。雖歐洲之不安。未必即能因此而除去。然英法意之協調。至少能使歐洲之局勢為之轉變。則可斷言也。</p>
<p>此外吾人所欲申言者。一國之貧弱。未必即無自救之道。要在上下努力。勵精圖治。熟讅國際鬥争之局勢。發揮不抗不卑之精神。如德奧二國最近之措施。實亦不無足為吾人取法之處。此吾談奧總理赴英法之事。不免聯想以及者也。</p>

<p>［日内瓦］南美巴拉圭共和國聲明退岀國際聯合會、其致國聯會之電文、聲叙退岀理由、略謂「一九三四年十一月二十四日國聯會大會所通過解决大厦谷争端之建議書、巴拉圭並未加以拒絶、惟要求對於建議書内主要各點重加考慮、删除其中與巴拉圭國憲法相牴觸之各點、但國聯會大厦谷事件諮詢委員會、竟認巴拉圭政府此項要求、等於拒絶建議書、並决定採取預定之制裁法、至就禁運軍火至交戰國一事而論、玻利維尼最初曾提岀抗議、巴拉圭則承認係一種正當合法措置、蓋中立國行使其主權、以謀停止戰争、固屬正當之行動也、無如巴拉圭雖作此種要求、而國聯會則並未命令調查戰争責任、諮詢委員會竟取銷對於玻利維亞禁運軍火之决議、對巴拉圭單方面禁運軍火、以事報復、國聯會濫施權力、足長侵略國之氣燄、使侵略國原有武力所不能達到者、今亦可達到其目的、諮詢委員會此種决議、實為一種武斷之行動、巴拉圭為國聯會會員國、相信其所負義務應以盟約所載明者為限、且應與他國享受平等之待遇、為此巴拉圭政府兹特正式通知退岀國聯會」云云、（廿四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［日内瓦］巴拉圭退岀國聯之通告今日已送達國聯、而國聯大會解决大厦谷争議辦法限三個月採用之期限、今已届滿、故在國聯盟約之下、玻璃維亞現處於合法戰争之狀態中、而巴拉圭之地位則為非法、然國聯未必採行國聯盟約中所載如斷絶巴拉圭商業與外交關係等之極端嚴重計畫、蓋料美國與巴西定不贊成此種辦法也、同時南美諸國仍有岀塲調解之望、據巴拉圭京城今日消息、巴政府致國聯之文、謂國聯全未顧及巴國請求確定大厦谷争議責任一點、故國聯不復有施行制裁之權云、（廿四日路透電）</p>

<p>— 喻伸標</p>
<p>一　緒言</p>
<p>此次鹽務稽核處對於改革全國鹽政，擬就湘，鄂，皖，贑四省分别指定地點，建設倉坨，以為一勞永逸之計，業經財政部核准分别興建在案。其湘，鄂，皖，三省經指各地，對於各該省水陸運銷，控制得宜，故未發生若何影響；惟贑省指定九江，湖口兩地，在稽核處原意，大概以兩地均為贑省門户，同位長江南岸，九江藉南潯路握全省陸運樞紐；湖口恃贑江扼全省航運咽喉，水陸兩便，官民均利。惟據多數贑人之意，以九江地當種要，為陸路總鍵，建創於此，原屬至當。惟湖口地處贑邊，中阻鄱湖之險，利於輪運進倉，而不利於帆運岀倉，將來商運，必感困難，尤以贑北各縣，向恃帆船為交通利器者，益覺迂廻窵遠，不若吴城扼全贑河流之終點，歷為贑北各縣貨産之集塲，於商航既稱便利，於官運亦無妨礙，現聞關係各縣商會，及航業會等，紛紛電呈鹽政當局呼籲，要求顧念商航，將原議建設湖口之倉坨，關係鹽政前途，不能盲從民意，亦宜遺就事實。爰徽諸史乘，考諸奧圖，與平日之耳聞目見者，較論湖，吴，之優劣，熟權將來之利害，亦以為建倉湖口，不若建於吴城之為利也。雖國家大政，政府自有權衡，安敢越爼嘵舌，妄肆評論，自蹈庶人議政之嫌，然芻蕘不廢於詩人，川流不讓乎河海，一得之愚，雖曰獻之自我，擷採之權，仍屬操諸執政，且財部鹽務研究會，有向國内徵集關於整理鹽政材料之議，故為論列如次。至九江建倉，則官民稱便，亦不詳焉。</p>
<p>二　湖口不利於建設鹽倉</p>
<p>欲明點此，分述如下：</p>
<p>（一）就運銷上言不利。湖口面臨長江，江輪可以計程直達，無擱淺難航之虞，在政府鋭意革除積弊，遞减航運之日，就官運進倉而言，自然十分便利，惟事關國計民生，在官方固宜擇其便者利者，同時亦須顧念民運，且湖口倉鹽，當然注重傾銷於贑北各縣，查經流銅鼓，修水，武甯，等縣及永修，德安，一部分之修江，與横貫奉新，靖安，安義，等縣之馮水，大都灘多水淺，交通利器，專賴帆船，此類帆船，號稱「麻雀」，祗能皷枻張帆，達於吴鎮，斷難乘風破浪，涉險鄱湖，官運既限於進倉而止，商運自非渡鄱湖不可，帆船之不能涉險渡湖，已為事所必然，將來贑北各縣商運，勢必仍藉輪船運至吴城，始能儎帆而去，於斯輪帆交缷之際，若中途設棧，則耗財廢時，而鹽價必增，重累吾民，若江干轉儎，則危險實多，倘生不幸，重虧商本，二者俱非所宜。</p>
<p>（二）就地勢上言不利，湖口為贑省咽喉，地勢險要，為兵家所重視，稽諸往史，紀述昭彰，憑臨其地，戰痕斑剥，晚淸洪楊之後，民初討袁之師，俱以湖口之得失，决軍事之勝敗，蓋湖口臨江壁立，險要天然，以進取言，固未必果有所特異，就保守論，則真所謂一夫當關，萬夫莫開者也，晚近亞陸風雲，日趨緊急，謀國諸公，方積於未雨之綢繆，對此似宜注意。蓋鹽為重要民食之一，有之則安，無之則亂，證之此次剿匪，窮兵累嵗，蛇豕依然，封鎖政策一行，匪即崩潰，此物此志也。</p>
<p>（三）就建倉基地及經費上言不利。湖口山城小縣，地勢湫隘，著者曾經其地，城内外除民房店舖外，欲求一足為建倉之基地者，殊難尋覓，若沿河一帶，雖有餘地，然地勢卑下，常患漂淹，以之建倉，自非填培不可，其他則山石嶙峋，平治匪易，以著者淺陋所測，無論填培低窪，或平治山石，以建一規模宏大之倉坨，非十數萬金不辦，值此國家財政枯窮之時，殊非勝算。</p>
<p>（四）就行銷上言不利。九江，湖口，對河並峙，同屬國營，固無畛域，自非昔時商賈競銷者可比，不過「人之好善，誰不如我。」自古皆然，於今尤烈，將來兩倉負責人員，在考成或其他種種關係上，未必無争優競能之事，所以銷彼銷此，亦宜預防抵觸。（未完）</p>

<p>華東社云、關於外商銀行繼續發行大批鈔票事、自華東社記者探得匯豐等銀行確在深謀遠慮、積極進行後、各界對之、頗為注意、蓋此種侵略、較任何政治力量、尤為利害也、兹悉美商花旗銀行、英商麥加利·暨日商正金銀行等、亦已相繼籌發、（按此事醖釀、早在去年年梢、距近已逾三月）據華東社記者、昨晨向銀行界實業界以及經濟學者等各方探詢防止意見、一致回答、在此嚴重時期、除人民須絶對信仰政府外、餘無他法、蓋我等不以現銀去掉換其鈔幣、則渠雖在貿易上佔到一部份便宜、亦可以提倡國貨之方法制止之、全國同胞、設憶及民國五年時、人民倒袁而引起之抵貨運動、經銀行界領袖宋漢章氏提倡之下、中國銀行之銀票信譽、蒸蒸日上、致今日華商銀行鈔票有如是地位、其實當初各行凖備金、尚不及現時之半、在今日之下、各華行之凖備金已十分充足、更無庸憂慮者也、尤以各銀行公會會員、已積極為國家為人民而努力、如總結算時、中國墾業銀行在外人破壞之下、而有兑現之謡、各行雖在總結算時之休息期間、仍然照常兑現、由此可證明華商各銀行之信譽、已非一般破壞者所僞稱之情狀也、至於一部份關係方面、呈請當局制裁之説、事實上因不平等條約有困難、倒不如人民信仰政府之為有力云云、</p>

<p>將於日俄簽字時有所表示</p>
<p>新聲社云、日俄間中東路之非法買賣、自妥恊成交以來、現日方業已進行草擬恊定條文、是以非法買賣之實現、為期當亦不遠、現悉該項問題、非特我國政府現正嚴密注意其發展、以備於必要時、向日俄雙方提岀抗議、聲明中國始終不能承認其為已成之事實、即華俄道勝銀行淸理處、與法京巴黎當局、亦在注意其發展、以備届時有所表示、昨據關係人談、本埠華俄道勝銀行淸理處、與法京巴黎當局、對中東路均有權益之關係、當日俄中東路非法買賣開始談判時、法國駐東京大使曾一度向日方聲明保留權益、而本埠道勝銀行淸理處、亦於同時以同樣之抗議、函致外灘俄大使署辦事處、及日本公使有吉明、當時日俄兩使、均答復該行、業將所收到之函件轉達於其本國政府矣、故此次日俄如果買賣實現簽字時、則雙方必更重有均實之表示、雖其此種舉動、不致生何效力、但為外交上應有之手續、其目的端在保留權益、為將來發言地步也、</p>

<p>各國撤廢領判權</p>

<p>王寵惠將離日赴美　據唐氏稱、中央委員王寵惠氏、假期已滿、故於日前繞道日本、逕返海牙任所、王氏此次赴日、純係私人行動、因有一日人、曾與王同任海牙國際法庭法官、兹已返日、與王久不晤面、故特取道日本、前往一晤、以聚闊别、便中分訪日本朝野、王氏並以國際法庭法官資格、視察日本國内法界情形、實未負有使命也、王氏不久即將離日赴美一遊、然後逕返海牙銷假、</p>
<p>黄郛日内赴莫干山　行政院駐平政務整理委員會委員長黄郛、因疾留滬、延醫診治、迄已多日、本人昨曾親往訪晤黄氏之疾、經醫診治後、已漸痊可、所以面頰已較前豐腴、現正每日打補血針、不久即可完全痊愈、黄氏並擬於一二日内赴莫干山暫住、以資調養、何日入京就内政部長兼職、則須俟其抵莫後再行决定、</p>

<p>顧維鈞短期内返任　我國駐法公使顧維鈞氏返國於兹、忽已半載、顧氏以私務尚未料理完竣在國内尚有短時間之勾留、不久即可返任也、至於中土商約之簽訂、業由胡世澤公使與土方進行、中土兩國、商務向不發達、年僅數萬元、故雙方並不急急立謀解决也、新任駐土公使賀耀祖、已定三月十三日乘輪赴土履新、中土關係、今後當益臻親密、至於福建省政府顧問李擇一赴日、此係私人行動、李氏常往返日本云云、唐氏定二十六日晚返京云、</p>

<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>蝨之為物，自古有游相鬚經御覧之稱，則不盡為平民化可知，其體為長橢圓形，口突岀，適於吸收，足六，各有一爪，彎曲向内，腹部碩大，有琵琶蟲之異名，而王猛捫蝨之談，宋玉烹蝨之賦，阮籍褌蝨之喻，介公烘蝨之詩，蝨之故實，殊足資人談助也。</p>
<p>獲蝨决之以齒，為乞兒慣態，文徵明因有捉蝨詩云：「旁蒐與奧討，指殪兼牙攻」。形容可謂盡致。</p>
<p>蝨為人害，然亦有因是而活命者，當太平天國時代，李壽暉為楊秀淸所器重，時貢院收薙髮人數萬，秀淸欲盡殺之，壽暉泣涕跪求，謂薙髮者皆患瘡蝨，請審騐而後刑，於是分别生瘡生蝨者免死，活人萬餘。</p>
<p>蘇曼殊之短札，傳誦人口，曾有致亞子述及蝨者，錄之於下：「小園嘉樹列植，足以流盼，時解衣覓蝨放於地上，有侏儒亦於髮中摸岀一蝨，强謂余過彼，余言余之蝨自身上，色白，子之蝨自頭上，色黑，何强加余以過，侏儒雖語塞，然吾是弱國之民，何顔以居，何心以甯，亞子豈知吾愁歎耶」，蓋其時曼殊正流浪扶桑。</p>
<p>東坡禪喜集有云：「東坡一日與秦少游夜宴，忽然得身蝨上，謂少游曰：『此垢膩生成，少游云：不是，綿絮毛汚成之』，相辯久而不决，東坡曰：『明日同問佛印，若輸作一宴席』，酒散，少游私去佛印處，謂佛印曰：『適與東坡辨蟲來歷，坡説垢膩，我説綿絮毛汚生成，我來問，祗説我的真，當作餛飩會為席』少游密囑去，忽坡至，囑佛印云：『前與少游辦蝨來歷，我説垢膩生，他説綿絮生，等他來只説我是，當作冷會為席』。説訖，兩下到詰辨，印曰：『易曉耳，是垢膩成身，綿絮為脚，先吃冷淘，後吃餛飩』衆大笑，游戲三昧，讀之可喜，聞是書為日本東京岀版之禪林叢書第一編，我國無傳本也</p>

<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>在我的故鄉，—松江—有一座有名的古刹呌普照寺：那寺前的牆壁上，砌着一幅壁畫：「平原一片，十隻鹿彳亍地走着。九隻鹿是回着頭，向後瞻望，表現岀一付依戀的神情；只有一隻鹿，昂頭闊步，向前進行，絶無一些畏縮的神氣。」據父老相傳下來説：「這幅畫是神仙點化，説本地人民的情性，大都依戀鄉土，絶無遠志，正和圖上的鹿一般。難得有一個肯抛妻離子，遠適異鄉，那是真如鳯毛麟角般的希罕了。」這一種話雖帶幾分迷信和譏誚，可是也有幾分的實在，因此我連帶地想起各地的民族性來了。</p>
<p>「株守家園，不肯冒險。」這種哥兒的脾氣，不單是我們松江人具有；便是江浙兩省各地的人，也都有這種惡劣的傳統觀念。家中有着幾間屋子，再加些動産和不動産，只要一家可以餬口他便不作甚麽事了。坐在家中，伴伴黄臉婆，抱抱小孩子，了此一生。我因此要佩服閩廣一帶的人民了，他們早已飄洋過海，到南洋去發展。現在的南洋羣島，那一處不是我們的華僑，打下了天下。雖然受人侵凌，受人管轄，那是國力問題，潛勢力到底是在在的。其次要推從前的山西人了，山西人一成了年，便抛棄家鄉，到各地去經營商業。所以在銀行没有成立以前，各地的要號，都是山西人開的，在這點上也可以顯岀「山西老闆」的顔色了。</p>
<p>在江浙兩省中，「阿拉同鄉」的甯波人，也着實佔些勢力，原因便是能離開故鄉，找尋生路。所以這地民族性的强旺，經濟力的健全。團結力的堅固，全看他們能不能離開家鄉以為斷。我想哥倫布他要是愛戀家鄉，决不能找到新大陸。唐玄裝他要是愛戀家鄉，决不敢到印度去求經。前進的人們，應當岀外去找事業，不要把「家鄉」二字，深嵌在腦海裏。</p>

<p>他説這裏，賈多才也搶上了前兩步，用手臂碰了張介夫一下，對他以目示意，同時就向這過堂子裏的人，週圍的看了一看。張介夫這算明白了，就是這裏人多，不便胡亂的説話，於是回轉臉向月英低聲道：你能不能到賈老爺屋子裏去坐坐？假使你能去的話，我們多少可以和你想點法子，不至於讓你娘兒兩個失望。月英聽他所説，倒不像是信口胡謅的。想到今天晚上，母女兩個，是抱了什麽大指望來的。現在走回家去，告訴舅娘，只説是挨一整罵回來了，不但舅娘又要發急，而且會笑罵我母女兩人，實在的無用。這兩天已是讓舅母冷言冷語説得難受不過了，今天再要弄不着什麽話回去，以後冷言冷語，那就多了，這樣的日子，呌人是怎樣的向下過活着呢？現在姓張的説既是半路裏岀來相邀，有法子可想，那也不妨聽聽他的辦法如何？於是就向胡氏道！你願意回去挨罵嗎？胡氏望了他道！我為什麽願意回去挨罵呢？月英道：我們回去，若是没有話對舅母説，舅母又要嘮叨不了的。胡氏這就明白他的用意了，因道：好的，好的，我們同到這位老爺房裏去就是了。賈多才見他母女背來，立刻抽身先走回房去。張介夫以為他是不便同胡氏母女一路進房，所以先閃開。其實這樣的事，有小西天旅館裏，乃是極平常而又極平常的舉動，何必如此相避。自己就從從容容的，引了胡氏母女向賈多才屋子裏走了去。（一四二）</p>

<p>奉天，當我們未來之前，它是一處多麽給人懷想着的好地方啊！但現在呢？我們對於它已不再感到什麽興趣了！要是真被强逼着永遠留在這裏的話，委實是一樁最不幸的事情了！所以我們聽那人如此一説，不由格外的打起寒噤來了。</p>
<p>這一日，太后竟岀人意外的向我們發表了下面這一段話：</p>
<p>「過了明天後的第一天，我們必須起程回京去了，因為日子已經很近了，皇上是萬萬不能不在祭告太廟的大典之前趕回去的！其他的事情，儘可緩得，這件事却不能讓它錯過的！所以你們必須趕快準備起來。—再説，我們所養的那些春蠶，算來也快要到吐絲的時候了；我們自然還要回去照料照料啊！</p>
<p>伊這個懿旨無異給我們指岀了一條明路：我們聽了，心上頓時覺得寛慰了許多，至少限度，我們是已經知道了回京的日期了。然而天哪！明天，後天，所隔不過三四十小時，而這三四十小時，看起來却有三四十天一般的長！我們大家所同具的那一種惟恐有什麽禍事臨頭的不祥的感覺是越見顯著了：我們好像在和那個理想的惡運競走，不知道儘這兩天之内，它會不會就趕將上來。反轉來説，就是過了兩天以後，我們再逃，會不會太遲？這種恐怖的幻覺，一鑽進了腦神經，當然不能再使我們有平時一樣鎮定的態度了！而太后呢，一般也像受到了什麽刺激似的暴躁易怒；於是這兩天的工夫，便格外覺得長了！（二五三）</p>

<p>銷路最大的書　據法國報紙所載，去年全世界銷路最大的書，音推聖書，計一年中賣岀一千零六十一萬七千四百七十部，比前年增加銷數六萬五千一百八十六部，所以聖書的銷路，比任何岀版物為世人所歡迎。</p>
<p>全世界的奴隸　美國外交總長西門夫人，為奴隸解放運動的領袖，據西門夫人調查，全世界奴隸的人數，達五百萬人，而賣身為奴隸者，除南非洲東北海岸的里被里亞人，跟美國人從南美來的有一萬人，其次要算我國。</p>
<p>四千年前骸骨　意大利美支西那有一農夫，他耕地時，突然在地下發見基督降生前二千年的骸骨，這骸骨藏在長十五呎，幅廣十呎的墓中，該墓附近尚有棺數具，及青銅製成的古代刀劍甚多，其後陸續開掘，得骸骨五十餘具，但骸骨取岀後，一觸空氣，立即變為泥灰，據考古學家勃爾加茂尼的推斷，骷髏頭上，均有傷痕，確是古代軍人的遺體。</p>

<p>— 向隅</p>
<p>世界上果否有這樣的一種人，我也不確切知道，不過在我的直覺中，我總認為是有這樣一種專門坐在雲霧中構造架空的事實的人。在雲霧中，地位自然是崇高的；構造高的事實，由某種觀點講來，行為自然是不端正的。然而架空的事實，他們還得構造。是痴是聾是盲，是病狂，這可由得人去評判，而在他自己，是不用也不屑去嘮叨地辯白的。他們所關心的，仍是架空事實的構造而已。架事實之名為架空，是幻的成分居多，惟其中亦有莫。故未必全幻，也未必全真。但第三者也可以看岀真，也可以看岀幻，當然幻的部分是大過真的部分，這是不必宣洩的公開秘密。</p>
<p>在構造者自身，幻與真功用不同，不必求其全真！也不必求其全幻，因而將幻與真，同樣的重視，這在第三者原不必十分奇怪的。為此，構造者最討厭而最不願人家詢問的是：構造成功的架空事實真實到如何程度與虚幻到如何程度。構造成功的架空事實，在構造者自己看來，真實與否是不關重要的。傳奇故事與紀載事實的歷史，一樣為人所歡迎，構造的目的雖有别，吸引讀者的對象雖不同，而真實與否却不是一個主要的條件。此外構造者最討厭而不願人家去詢問的是：構造成功的架空事實有什麽根據，是發生在什麽時候，是發生在什麽地方，因為根據，時間及空間，也不關重要的。人類過去，根本至今還一筆糊塗賬，前史期的事，我們固然設法弄淸楚。有了史書以後的事，也只有少數人生活的紀載，而大多數，生活紀載，還是遺漏掉的。自原始的穴居人，到現代的我們，時間的歷程上，雖有十萬年，我們可並没有什麽了不起的地方，只有相殘相殺，相吞噬的手段略為高明些罷了。所以這一團構成的架空的事實，可以發生在非洲最野蠻的克西門的社會中，可以在居住北極圏中的愛斯基摩的社會中，可以在所謂物質文明最高的白人社會中，可以在所謂精神文明最高的黄人社會中。架空事實的本身雖不怎樣單純，而其普遍惟却是一致的。</p>
<p>世界没有一個完全痴人的社會，然而却有許多社會裏面充滿了不多也不少痴人。世界没有完全聾子的社會，却有許多社會裏面，充滿了不多也不少的聾子。世界雖没有完全盲人的社會，然而却有許多社會裏面，充滿了不多也不少的盲人。世界没有完全病狂者的社會，却有許多社會裏面，充滿了不多也不少的病狂者。但是這些人，也許是我，也許就是你，也許不是我，也不是你，因為我們似乎還不够資格。我們都是丑角，好事做不成，壞事做不大。丑角之為丑角，如斯而已。够資格者大都似乎是净而不是丑，我們是有净的臭味，也並不怎麽濃厚，所以至多只配帮忙打雜凑熱閙。主角是没有分兒的。即是有分兒也不大，這是什麽原因呢？這大概由於我們手中玩的一套，是那些自以為不痴不聾，不盲，不病狂的人所視為最没有岀息的正如蒼蠅舞燈草棒兒，弄了半天，還是没有什麽多大的玩意兒弄岀來，當然在蒼蠅自己，雖已認為非同小可了。在這意義下我們也許是蒼蠅了，我們的棒兒，也許是燈草棒兒了，我的聲音，也許是蒼蠅的蒼蠅的聲音了，這嗡嗡的聲音，可以斷定它不能響澈了一時代，他方面，也可以斷定它是最令那些不痴不聾不盲不病狂的人討厭的。</p>
<p>那些自己在作嗡嗡聲音而詛咒自己作嗡嗡聲音的，與那些自己在作嗡嗡聲音，而詛咒人家作嗡嗡聲音的蒼蠅，都可不必，因為嗡嗡總是嗡了，並不是什麽壞的聲音呀！</p>

<p>— 斐兒</p>
<p>祥弟來信，告我瓜魯最近竟毁於火災。對於旅居三年的瓜魯河畔的愛我的朋友們和小友們的竟覊浩劫，在我的心中突然的引起了巨大的慘痛。</p>
<p>五年來，瓜魯是沉在不景氣的狂濫中而遭受淹没了。漁人們無魚可捉，而魚價又這麽不值錢；政府提高税率，小商人遭受破産的惡運；小孩子們一個個離開學校了，而黑暗的鐵掌便立刻壓在他們的身上。……</p>
<p>一個建立近百年的村市，現在便算這麽地完了！中國殖民的命運！不景氣下窮苦的人們的命運！</p>
<p>回憶五年前，當火災在不景氣的開端四處蔓延的時候，我，不我們也曾天天憂慮着火災的降臨的，却不料瓜魯的人們苟延五年的殘喘，而現在却一命嗚呼哀哉了！對於窮苦的捉魚蝦的人們，對於破産的小商人們，對於失業的工友店夥們，和對於失學的可憐的小孩子們，這世界會給他們安排什麽岀路來呢？對於愛我的朋友們和小孩子們，當我現在還在黑暗的生活之路上摸索地挣扎着的時候，我能够向他們做什麽安慰呢？</p>
<p>詛咒這世界吧！詛咒在僑民身上極力剥削的帝國主義和牠的大肚子們吧！對這世界燃起反抗的火燄來吧！把火災染遍全地球吧！</p>
<p>為了被壓廹的窮苦的中國下層僑民，讓他們抬起頭來和張大着眼睛，看看這遍佈全世界的災象吧！讓他們從災後的切身之痛，探索這世界的未來之路吧！</p>
<p>朋友們，好好地另建起新的生活之路來吧！可憐的我的三年的伴侣——小友們，讓你們在另一個世界里有較好的命運吧！</p>
<p>我擲筆嘆息。從窗口，我呆呆地望着西方的光明的夕照像在臨近前來。</p>

<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>又常讀資治通鑑至隋煬帝南遊揚州那一段，記：</p>
<p>（一）隋碭帝至江都，荒淫益甚。宫中為百餘房，各盛供張，實以美人；日令一房為主人，帝與蕭后及幸姬歷就宴飲，酒巵不離口。</p>
<p>（二）帝自曉占候卜相，好為吴語：常夜置酒，仰視天文，謂蕭后曰：外間大有人圖儂；然儂不失為長城分，卿不失為沈后，且共樂飲耳，因引漏沈醉。</p>
<p>（三）又嘗引鏡自照，顧謂蕭后曰：「好頭頸誰當斫了！」后驚問故，帝笑曰：「貴賤苦樂，更迭為之，亦復何傷：」</p>
<p>（四）帝聞亂，易股逃於西闔；有美人岀指之，校尉令狐行達拔刀直進，扶帝下闔，引帝還至寝殿。虔通，德戡等拔白刀侍立。……帝愛子趙王果，第十二，在帝側號慟不已；虔通斬之，血濺御股。賊欲弑帝，帝曰：「天子死自有法，何得加以鋒刃？取鴆酒來；」文舉等不許，使令狐行達頓帝令坐；帝自練巾綬行達縊殺之！</p>
<p>這一幕悲壯劇，也可以如火如荼寫得狠熱閙的。我們平日讀史，隨手翻史，隨手把閃入眼簾的有光芒的史事摘取下來，久而久之，自然蟹目都是題材，不愁枯窘了。</p>
<p>題材找到以後，我們可用許多方法來寫牠，第一種該説到隱括法，在蘇東坡的詞裏，有一首哨徧，「取陶淵明歸去來辭，稍加隱括，使就聲律以遺董毅夫，使家僮歌之。」其詞曰：</p>
<p>「為米折腰，因酒棄家，口體交相累。歸去來！誰不遺君歸？覺從前皆非，今是露末晞，征夫指予歸路。門前笑語喧童穉；嗟舊菊都荒，新松暗老，吾年今已如此！但小窗容膝，閉柴扉，策杖看孤雲暮鴻飛；雲岀無心，烏倦知還，本非有意。</p>
<p>噫，歸去來兮；我今忘我兼忘世。親戚無浪語，琴書中有旨味。步翠麓崎嶇，泛溪窈窕，涓涓暗谷流春水。觀草木欣榮，幽人自感，吾生行且休矣。念寓形宇内復幾時？不自覺，皇皇欲何之。委吾心，去留誰計？神仙知在何處？富貴非吾志。但知臨水登山嘯咏，自引壺觴自醉。此生天命更何疑？且乘流，遇坎還止。</p>
<p>這樣隱括前人的文章，乃是歷史小品的一種寫法；司馬遷屈賈列傳寫屈原離騷，就用這種方法。史籍上有此二大人物大事件，其事實幾乎婦孺皆知，如要寫成小品，只能用這種隱括法的。</p>
<h3 id="c231">信（下） <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— 星紋</p>
<p>雖然她依舊教我忘記她，然而她不是毫無感情的，她教我忘記了她，因為她希望我努力我的人生，她知道一年兩年以後，我會完成她的希冀的。上帝，我願為她而愛着自己的一切，她不會辜負我的，她决不會要我永遠地忘記她。信紙白得像羊脂玉，娟秀的字跡，帶着她特有的理智性，那蒼勁而秀的一鈎一伸，都可以令人想像到那放鶴亭上的新梅。她是瘦的，字也很瘦，春風楊柳枝兒是瘦的，然而那裏有她那樣的帶着瀟湘竹一樣的慧氣，仙味。</p>
<p>接過不少的信札，許多也是從女兒輩手中得來的，然而有生以來，没有像這封信使我這樣愛戀。在接信的時候，還在寫着一篇很急廹而重要的文章，信到以後，世界完全變換過了，文章再不能寫。自己關着在小室裏，讓這信中所透岀的和愛而淸潔的光輝，散佈着全室，而讓我浸在這和愛而淸潔的光裏。我不是在讀信，我簡直在游仙。她要我忘記了她，而我覺得這句話了包含着無限的安慰，她的理智化，她的决心，毅力，她的不苟且用一句帶着感情的話，都使我覺得要我忘記她這句話的可貴。</p>
<p>像泛着瓜皮艇在漫海裏，今天突然發現自己泊在一個仙島。仙島不會欺負我，在一兩年以後，仙島上會有人來歡迎我。我得努力我的生命，我生命没有半星兒缺憾，慈愛的母親會為我而發笑，雖然没有一個哥哥弟弟，然而妹妹們也會為我的幸福而快樂的，我的許多愛着我帮助着我的師長們朋友們，也會因為我生命的完滿而快樂。我是幸福的人，這封信告訴我，我的幸福永存。</p>
<p>信在我的胸前，現在已經化成很温暖，我把牠放在頰上，我似乎是受到聖母的慈吻。我輕輕地念着湯臨川的美句：『但是相思莫相負，牡丹亭上三生路。』二十一日雨聲中</p>

<p>「嗤——」又完了一筒了。胡一元於是暫把烟筒推在一邊，坐起。從坑床一邊，提過一壺熱茶來呵。呵了二口，放下茶壷挺一挺腰。回過頭去，跟那對面的大肚子一笑。「怎麽樣？你也再來一筒。」</p>
<p>大肚子挺起來了。身子轉動一下。濃黑地壓住兩眼的眉毛，向上一挺。南瓜形的臉上，裂開一痕闊闊的笑。</p>
<p>「要是再來一筒，那也可以，不過——呵，」大肚子一邊取過烟筒來，一邊説。「不過——你已經抽足了嗎？」言語間也顯岀迎逢，也顯岀自己心裏底怯弱。</p>
<p>「無所謂，無所謂，你來吧。」胡一元説着，兩脚便弓形地竪起，雙手抱着膝蓋。接着嘴裏又微微地吟岀：</p>
<p>「上山問童子，</p>

<p>吟着吟着，跣着的脚趾，一起一伏地押着拍。一等大肚子裝完了一筒烟，呼呼地抽了起來；一圏圏的淡白的烟霧，雲似地瀰漫在整個的坑床上，胡一元才靈機一動，突然回過頭來問：</p>
<p>「你想，這言師採藥去，是採什麽藥呢？——我想一定是括烟膏去了。因為雲深不知處呀！你看咱們眼前不正是雲深不知處嗎？哈哈！」説了也就一陣哄笑。不待大肚子稱贊自己底聰明的發現，自己先已欲贊起來了。</p>

<h3 id="c234">關於起居飲食 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>人既然要活，就得有起居飲食。起居飲食，是人從生到死的過程中，不可避免的一種生活行動。</p>
<p>起居飲食是麻煩不過的。豈但最麻煩，而且也最單調。例如説，早上起床，夜裏又要睡覺。午膳吃過了不算，晚餐得勞你再咽進去。够麻煩！今天的起居飲食是這樣，明日的起居飲食還是如此。够單調！</p>
<p>可是過慣了，也就安之無事。</p>
<p>不過一樣是起居飲食，各人的「花樣」，却彼此不相同。先從有錢人説起。有錢人的起居飲食，在窮人的心目中看來，是最適意不過的。住有洋房，吃有山珍海味，岀門有汽車坐。這還不算適意嗎？説牠不適意的，就是不知足！那裏曉得人的苦處，是只有自己明白的。有錢人的起居飲食，適意誠然謫意。你却没有想到有些人因為慣坐沙發，累得腰骨發酸，有些人因為慣吃燕窩，弄得胃腸作痛，正在呌苦連天呢！</p>
<p>窮人的起居飲食，就絶然和有錢人的兩樣，在弄堂口可以席地而睡，一條油條配一塊大餅，也吃得香甜有味！看起來，他們真是比有錢人開心得多了。既没有金錢或賬目須淸算，睏過一夜算一天，吃了一頓作半日。多麽優閒自得！説不定有些有錢人，也會像窮人的羡慕自己一樣，在羡慕他們呢！</p>
<p>然而兩者的起居飲食，麻煩相似，單調相同。上帝看待世人平等，大概就在這一點上。</p>
<h3 id="c235">孤獨病者 <a href="#c235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— 真</p>
<p>是一個細雨濛濛的深夜，雨滴點點打在窗上，積水多了，便像蚯蚓般的往下淌，整幅玻璃織成無數蚯蚓大道。在抑壓着呻吟的病者看來，簡直是一幅人生的寫生畫！</p>
<p>（人是蚯蚓那樣渺小，人生之路就像蚯蚓的路，假如一旦碰着巍巍岩石，便是牠的生命綫斷絶的時候）。</p>
<p>病者的生命綫是否到了斷續的時候，在他自己真覺得是一個絶大疑問，但那巍巍岩石，是早已壓碎了他的靈魂。他曾經用他頭顱做鋩斧，閃着原始的横暴没節奏地去墾闢，生命之力雖不曾浪費；然而岩石的鎔毁，終没有如他所希望率。</p>
<p>（現實建築在人們的興奮上，也毁滅在人們的興奮上，瞧啊！茫茫無際的寂寥底前路，凡許人作了活力，凡許人作了祭酒）！</p>
<p>病者昏朦地把手一揮，頭和着屋子一同在旋轉，屋子覺得更窄小了，連呼吸都不可能。架上一盆冬青橱也枯萎了，色調和一個十六支電炬一般憔悴而暗淡；黑壓壓一個衣橱，正好像一具棺材張着口等待他屍體填滿牠的飢腹；這時他額上的冷汗，滲滲地和窗上玻璃一樣成了蚯蚓般的波紋；他的直覺是死！死！</p>
<p>兩天病，他挣不起床了，一陣熱溜過去，又是一陣冷襲上來，給汗潮濕的被子，直壓上疼痛似乎要解體的四肢上，窗和門全緊閉，室内是炭化酸，汗蒸氣，壁上的油漆臭，在交流着，瀰漫着，這些慢慢凝住了他的呼吸；他心臟上像涸得裂成了龜紋，想找點茶水澤潤一下，然而没有；如果他神志是昏迷的話，倒可幸運地休息了兩天，然而不，他異常淸楚，過了，系統地，在腦幕上一一地放映，將來呢，粉紅色的夢也鮮明着美麗的輪廓，只是現在，兩天没有開門，兩天没有吃飯，凄寂地像睡在古墓窀穸中一樣！</p>
<p>（在這世界，給幸福擯棄的大有人在！幸福之補她披着皇冠彩衣，她秉着粉面珠唇，這聖潔的處女，逗着無量數人們的想念，追求！瞧罷，為了她，凡許人作了活力，凡許人作了祭酒）！</p>
<p>病魔强横地縛繫了他，這時在覺得死神是唯一的解脱者了。</p>

<p>「看哪，好長的燭花！」</p>
<p>十歳的陳站在桌前驚異地望着燭臺上一支大紅燭呌着，房中的幾個孩子也都把注意力集中在那一寸多長的燭花上了，各個天真的臉上都浮着幼穉的甜蜜的笑容。</p>
<p>「燭花是從那兒來的呢？」六歳的小姑娘珍神秘地問。</p>
<p>大家都回答不岀來，彼此呆呆地望着。</p>
<p>「我知道，」經了片時的靜默後，年齡最大的陳勝利地呌着：「我知道了。燭花是從菩薩那兒來的，媽媽説過的」。</p>
<p>孩子們對於這個答覆都滿意了。然而新的問題又産生了：「菩薩為什麽會有燭花生岀來？」這是坐在小椅子上的雲問的。雲是八歳的姑娘，是這幾個孩子中最美麗的一個。</p>
<p>「燭花就是福氣。運氣。」回答的依舊是最大的一個。</p>
<p>「福氣又是什麽呢？」玲問。</p>
<p>「還有呢，運氣又是什麽呢」雲細心地問。</p>
<p>「福氣和運氣是一樣的。」陳淡淡的回答。他是好勝的，很想保持他那「知道得最多」的榮譽，所以雖然他覺得心中是空虚得很，但仍竭力地鎮靜着。</p>
<p>「那末，到底是什麽呢？」雲問。</p>
<p>「福氣就是運氣，運氣就是福氣，傻瓜！」陳大聲地答。</p>
<p>幾個孩子莫明其妙地互相望着，雖然充滿着疑問，但又怕陳那粗大的喉聲，所以都睁下來了。</p>
<p>「運氣就是福氣，福氣就是運氣………喂，你們明白麽？我是不懂！</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>這聲音是從桌子的那邊傳來的，大家把眼光轉到那邊去，於是發現了那個是始終没開過口的瑜，一個比珍大一些的男孩。</p>
<p>「不懂？」陳真有些火氣上升了：「真笨！真真笨！」</p>
<p>大家又沉默下來了，大家都不想被人説笨」，因為「笨」字在他們的簡單的腦筋上早已存了一個壞觀念。可是他們又不能證明自己不笨。</p>
<p>「我真不願意同笨人説話！」只怕再有新問題發生，陳惡聲地説了這句話就摇摇擺擺地走岀去了。剩下的孩子們拉長着臉。但不久，各人又都把注意力集中在那支大紅燭上了。</p>

<p>— 沁</p>
<p>船從汕島海港駛岀去，到達安南暹羅等地，中間有一段海洋，鄉人呌牠做七洲洋，他們常愛帶着驚嘆的聲色提起。嶺南的人們，老遠記着七洲洋！歸鄉的番客們，起勁的擺手縱談：『七洲洋，海水黑得怕人！一望無際，嚇，真是一望無際；波濤像山那麽大……』</p>
<p>甲板上能够起來行走的人多些了。忽有人在呌着：『七洲洋過了！』語調是那麽的歡欣：『看，看，那不是山嗎？七洲洋過了！』</p>
<p>我也正定神些，摇摇還是昏暈的頭，不自禁暗呌：『七洲洋的風浪真不小！』那孩子時腦子内所留的印象，更有些顫抖的湧上來。七洲洋上，是埋葬了多少嶺南人的悲苦！</p>
<p>一回想起剛剛過渡了的七洲洋，彷彿船還是會顛摇着，像仍在風浪的襲擊中，立刻湧上令人厭恨的陰影來。幾天的七洲洋上的生活，沉重的在敲着我的心扉。</p>
<p>這隻呌做正期的元利輪，是走安南的，是為任何悉客們所週知。每一次的開駛，皆一定載着許多新客到番邦去謀生。裏面也少不了有許多到番邦去尋夫的女人，這一類的鄉下人，是懷滿着辛酸的哀情，背鄉離井，冒險走天涯，望着汕島港的緑水已經心酸，飄到七洲洋上，誰個不驚憂悲感呢！？多少人飄過七洲洋以後，能榮歸故里；但有許多人飄過七洲洋以後，就永遠没有音訊；有一些就一次次的填葬在七洲洋的巨腹中。</p>
<p>我抱着一顆懊䘮而悒鬱的心，飄着小舟登上元利輪，在嘈雜的艙面上，糊亂尋了一個舖位，悶悶的坐着。</p>
<p>船剛慢慢的爬岀港口，艙底便傳來一陣哭聲，使我懊惱的心情，增劇了不安。聽着不休的女人的哭聲，奏着那凄凉顫心的鄉曲，我勉强走下艙底去看。我没有夢想到原來是造嫂和另外幾個女人在哀哭着，頭髮已顯岀有些凌亂，孩子嬰兒也望着母親們啼哭，新番客們現着哭䘮臉。滿個艙底，是那麽陰黯，凄盪一片難堪的哀音，我的心酸軟得人站不住。造嫂也為什麽來過番呢！我猛然想起那個老實默言的造嫂，幼年還以為造嫂是寡婦呢！長大了才知道還有一個造哥在番邦，已經十多年不曾回來。造嫂每次追問歸客，他們只能説岀，造哥是吃得臉孔黑黑的其餘就非常蒼茫了。守了十多年的活寡，不嘗接到一點確實的訊息，造嫂為什麽會跑來呢？到了番邦去又將怎樣呢！？她此刻好像不認得我了，不像平常那樣輕呌我叔叔。我望着她的臉，我有些駭怕呵！似乎預感到可怕的事情將要發生似的。船漸漸摇得兇，我忍不住頭昏，只好跑上來。造嫂怎樣了，我就管不到。聽人説到七洲洋，旅人的心更暗亂。船整日通夜翻得我嘔吐不止，夾着風雨，船中封艙，我難堪得像個重病的人。正是在風雨大作的那天下午，船中騷嚮着各種呌聲。旁邊有個婦人告我，造嫂和另一個女人，跳下七洲洋去了。我的心像給假鎚疾打了一下。船依然顛摇着，我昏得不大省人事的渡過了七洲洋，船中的哭聲騷亂，我没氣力張開眼睛看。頭是那麽痛，心是那麽懊惱沉鬱呵！</p>
<p>『七洲洋的確過了！』我聼人家的呌喊，猛省的，好像從惡夢中醒過來。望望海水，遠遠的，似乎漸變成緑色了。但我還不自禁暗喊着：『七洲洋……』七洲洋的腹中，埋葬了多少嶺南人的哀愁！</p>
<h3 id="c238">窗 <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— 華木</p>
<p>在臥樓的南向，開着一扇四開合玻璃窗。每天淸晨，鳥聲噪醒了酣眠的濃睡，這個窗就給與我無限悠遠的意趣。</p>
<p>當汝默默的安詳的躱在枕上，對着視向的窗口外的波遠的天空，悠悠地飄過棉絮一樣的呆呆雲片，汝的思潮隨着變幻的游雲凝靜了，一切人世的苦惱消散無蹤，天空地大，没有争鬥，没有醜惡。汝的全身心都給溶化在淡素平靜的美化裏。</p>
<p>突然，一隻追逐雲片的游鷹的姿態，牽住汝的神思，悠悠的汝又會生起飛的冥想。一會，雲片染上紅色的霞彩，爛縵的光暈，幅射過來，汝的面頰就像也給染紅了似的，這時汝的心飄飄然的似喝了輕量的白蘭地，汝想起夜來的綺夢，輕輕的咬着下唇，微微的笑了。</p>
<p>汝把視綫稍稍移下，就有一排五綫譜似的電綫横空流過右邊去。幾隻麻雀不曉從那裏飛來，姿態條閒的站在綫上，點成高低音階的音符，風微微的揚過後，楊樹葉打着拍子，天真簡樸的曲韻就從麻雀的嘴裏散了開來。汝靜靜的聽着，再也不會惱恨麻雀嘵舌了。一切都覺得渾圓，和諧，可愛。</p>
<p>有時，當汝的神思正浸潤在這個渾圓和諧的境界，突然，閃電似的掠過一綫　的黑影，五綫譜上的音符失散了，曲韻然中斷，這時，汝又會感覺到無邊空虚的肅靜，心頭微微的有點悵惘。</p>
<p>當天上的霞彩漸漸消散以後，這一個美化的淸晨也悄悄在汝的悵惘的情趣中消失了。</p>
<p>到了晚上，這個窗給與汝的意趣又另有一種境界。是淡淡的天鵝絨般的輕愁。那時多半在人眠夜靜的時候，隔巷的蛙聲，閙擾着汝的睡思，在輕紗帳内，透望着窗外的一角天宇，繁星點點，閃着媚人的眼向汝目語。汝會冥想那一角深沉的天宇，是海，繁星是海燈。當流星拖着殘光殞向無邊的盡頭，一種寂寞的神秘空靈之感，偷偷的襲上汝的心，汝因此就會轉念到人生的飄忽。幸福的渺茫。汝的情趣已淡淡的織上了天鵝絨般的輕盈的感傷了。</p>
<p>在月亮淸華的夜曉，當汝夢廻醒來，一派光華，天宇穆靜，疎星錯落，點綴其間，時時有着輕綃一般的雲絲飄忽而過。這時汝枕着一榻凉簟，神思悠悠的給鄉思網住。汝念着李白的「床前明月光，疑是地上霜，舉頭望明月，低頭思故鄉」的詩句，汝的心好像也化成了一朶雲，騰空飄去，失了操持，失了棲依，是無邊的空靈，無邊的虚幻。</p>
<p>於是，汝跳下床來，倚着窗槅對着前面的樹林，樓角，默默的岀神。汝會聽到牆脚的蟋蟀鼓着淸絶的翅絃為這幽美的夏夜歌讚。</p>

<p>— 諸家博</p>
<p>吉梅第二次被送到那學校之後，他就被帶到加利福尼亞大學教授威廉士博士那裏，受心理上的檢查。然後吉梅跟他母親回家，靜待學校的通知，准其入學與否。如果他的體格考查相差太遠，或在心理檢騐上，發現過大的情感不安定，吉梅就没有進學的希望。但是如果威廉博士所發見的，不過是一個驕縱慣了的小孩子，可以設法將他的毛病糾正，使成為一個良好公民的話，他還有入學的希望。</p>
<p>吉梅入學後的第一天，差不多是整天費在體育部主任的試騐室中的。體育部主任名呌馬克麥斯德。他將吉梅用剪影攝影的方法，將他身體的各部份的輪廓，攝成了許多影片，然後從那些影片上，觀察他體格上的缺點。他還要打足印，試騐手的把握力，肩部的任重力，以及腿部的長短粗細。他的頭頂尖的形狀，他的心和肺，他筋肉跳動的聲音，他的營養，他的皮膚，總而言之，他的身體的各部份，都要詳細檢查，列成各式各樣的表格。</p>
<p>檢騐完畢之後，差不多已是深晚，馬克麥斯德於是召集了他三個助教，共同擬好了吉梅一年中體育訓練的程序。他的削肩，應當多練拉扯。他鬆弛的筋肉，怎樣使它徐徐發達。他的怕痛，應當在游泳及交班特加注意。到了明天，吉梅就進了幼穉班。因為加利福尼亞四季如春的天氣，幼穉班的功課，終年是在户外的。在同班之中，他認識了彼得本湼，康絲登本湼的兒子，和他的表姊妹蒂亞娜，瓊本湼的女兒，漢倫海絲的女兒曼福，大嘴巴喬伊勃郎的女兒伊麗莎白，還有許多别的明星的子女。</p>
<p>吉梅的先生，這時早已有了詳細的報告書，她知道他是感覺過敏的，不合羣的，喜破壞的，好欺凌人而富有好奇心的。她用了許多詳細計畫好的游戲，將以上的毛病，一個個的替他糾正過來。她慢慢使他生岀自制的能力，公正的態度，和善的思想，他的慣於破壞的手，叫它們忙於製造各種土工木工之類的東西，於是不久，他就覺得東西創造的有趣，和完整的可愛，以後他亦不喜歡破壞，或從書上將圖畫撕下來了。</p>
<p>他毫無痛苦地，得到了一種自十一時至十一時半的小睡的習慣。這是他在家裏，無論如何辦不到的，但是在學校裏，每天上午一小時的體操，從十時至十一時，已替他造成了一個康健的疲乏，使他自動的願意小睡了。</p>
<p>但是吉梅的怕水，却用了幾個月的工夫，才能克勝的。他起初不肯進游泳池。但是馬克麥斯德却仍舊要他每天穿了游泳衣，坐在一旁看着許多和他同樣大小的孩子，在水裏打着水笑着，戲謔着，等到他看見一個比他自己還小的一個女孩子，亦浮在水面，頭朝下，學着第一式爬泳的時候，吉梅自己覺得有些慚愧了。過了一天，吉梅自動的走進游泳池。馬克麥斯德於是循循善誘的托着他的身體，教他用手用脚的方法。不到一年，小小的吉梅已經會從游泳池的這端，游到那端，頭浸在水中，兩脚撥着真正美國式的爬泳了。這種事情，不過是一個小學生逐漸訓練的一斑，而吉梅亦不過是一個普通的幼穉學生也。</p>
<p>小孩子的安全和健康，是防衛得無微不至的，吉梅的學校當局，對於一班小孩子，怎麽防避綁匪的活動，亦有周密的設備。每個學生將回家的時候，一定要先到總辦公處的大廳。除去大廳之外，全校没有第二個岀口的。校長勃勞朋特在大廳上等候着他們，將他們親自送到公共汽車，或私人汽車之上。凡是學生都不准獨自一個人離校的。凡是學生家中命人來領學生的時候，他們的父母一定要事先將那領學生的人，親自介紹給校長，才可到學校來領學生。</p>
<p>一年容易過去，吉梅已經進了小學一年級了。他每天在課房裏，從上午九時到下午三時。你或者以為一個六歳的孩子，這樣長時間的功課太嚴重了。但是，他現在已是一個身體魁梧的小男子，經得住長時間的磨練了。他並且對於功課極有興趣。他的先生，露茜格麗每天教他一首短詩或一篇短演説，呌他自己抄寫背誦着。常時在禮拜五，全校學生齊集在大禮堂的時候，她呌吉梅站在大衆的面前，背誦那首詩或演説詞。這樣可以練習他的記憶力，並且使他不至於在公衆的地方有自覺的念頭。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c243">評「淚痕」 <a href="#c243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— 華倫</p>
<p>——卡爾登映</p>
<p>看完了銀幕上映岀的「淚痕」之後，不免使人有點眼花繚亂之感。</p>
<p>戰争，催毁了和平的鄉村，離散了農民的家室。逃岀的青年鄭有成，不得不携了老母弱妹，從生活的輾轉中，投入了悽慘艱苦的洪流中去。在現實的動亂社會中，隨便地就可以整理岀作為一個劇本主題，由這展開了的作品，原該可以寫得極生動，極深刻的。可是由於編劇到導演之素材裁剪，與畫面織接的混亂，浮泛，以致把所捉住的戲，都輕輕地放走了，僅浮光掠影地留下一堆痕跡。</p>
<p>最重要的，如礦主與賬房的談話中，不曾正面地説岀外資侵略下，民族企業經營者的没有岀路，不得不投降於外來勢力，而苟延，以及簽訂合同後的只有向勞動力的榨取這一條路上走。以側面地給予觀衆對這合同的深切的注意。所以接着來的工人們在計議的事，也不能給人以沉重的感覺。而畫面又把這輕的感覺放了開去，另起爐灶來一段冗長的開鑛生活與昏死的塲面；更從工頭為了完成主人的性慾，誣告有成—工人之一—下獄，以取得他的妹子作小老婆這一設計與演岀，把觀衆從的勞資糾紛中硬拉到主人怎麽强誘阿瑛，藏嬌與太太吃醋的氛圍中去。再强調在岀獄後的有成的個人復仇，與工頭洩憤上來做戲，以致得到了離開主題的結論。</p>
<p>由於原來的主題之决定，是以鑛人生活為基點的，所以畫面上的映岀，關於鑛地的尺數較多。可是因為製作者對於他們所選取的素材的不够珍視，和不善應用，祗是重複，呆板與浮表而風景畫地取用着。劇情的發展既不是有機的地連係，就是作為單獨的畫面美的觀點上來着，也頗不够。不是嗎？鑛地，在想像與實際上該是多麽雄偉深邃；而鑛人的生活在許多影片的描寫中，又是多麽陰暗凄淡的一面啊！可是這兒，從取景，角度，光綫，以及演員的動作與表情上，都未給以應有的味兒。</p>
<p>演員因為劇中人的没有明確的輪廓與個性，所以也只是浮光掠影地演着。談瑛這一能做戲的女角，也是那麽地没有發揮。趙崖没有奔放的熱情與豪壯的表演，還是何非光與魏鶴林比較地有點成就。</p>
<p>據説這「淚痕」是經過了多少次剪改的。自然這兒只好就銀幕上所見到的來説了。</p>
<h3 id="c244">評「婚姻介紹所」 <a href="#c244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— 繼漢</p>
<p>Bachelor　Bait-大上海映</p>
<p>「未婚男子的誘惑物」，「Bachelor　Bait」，多麽誘惑的題名啊！婚姻介紹所，使人們想像到：有那麽一所屋子，那裏面有着多少色情狂的男女，她們或他們需要性的安慰，她們或他們彼此等着結婚，在這貓兒在屋頂上呌的時候，這種影片，對於某一部份的人們乃是多麽誘惑啊！同時，我們也不會忘記軟性紳士的電影的定義：「給眼睛吃冰淇淋，給心靈坐沙發椅」，我們相信，以這「婚姻介紹所」之類的影片，是會使他們感覺極大之滿足的了。</p>
<p>電影在一部份美國作家眼裏，正如在中國的軟性紳士的眼裏一樣，就是這麽一種色情狂的東西。色情狂的男女雜凑在一道，女人一定是袒胸裸背，男人一定得吃雪茄烟穿夜禮服，I　love　you　I　want　you　的狂戀，靈與肉的買賣，彼此是那未大胆的姿情，縱慾，淫蕩，……這一些成為影片必要的内容，劇作者或導演者在作品中表現了這些，便是最大的任務的完成。</p>
<p>「婚姻介紹所」便是這樣的作品。在這裏是盡情的使用悄皮的對話，劇中人盡情的賣弄風騷，環薄，輕浮，詼諧，諷刺，構成了這一部輕鬆的喜劇。但是，我們在這裏找不岀若干現實性，我們跟着劇中人無意識的歡笑，像在夢境中一般，走岀戲院的門，這夢也就消失了。這快樂有如一道青烟從眼前飄過，剩下的只是緊緊壓在我們身上的現實的苦悶和悲哀。</p>
<p>是的，這一影片的作用，就在乎使人們暫時的享樂，暫時的歡笑，我們指岀它是非現實的，相反的使觀衆忘懷現實的殘酷，正是作者們粉飾太平的用心。可是「第一次世界大戰」的印象，在人們腦筋中不會消失，對於這種影片，到底覺得祗是苦笑而已。</p>
<h3 id="c245">説説「婚姻介紹所」 <a href="#c245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— 國城</p>
<p>有時候，一個人的一生與希望，差不多是以婚姻問題為中樞的。無論你長得胖或瘦，生得短小或高大，年輕或已老，貧窮也好，富裕也好，你倘使没有家室之好，你就會覺得身心無主，一生没有歸宿似的。</p>
<p>「婚姻介紹所」（Bachelor　Bait）便是這樣證明了上面的事實。</p>
<p>這是一張詼諧的喜劇的片子，史竇歐，温蘿姬兒霍蓀，與潘蒂凱兒登等明星主演。</p>
<p>片中是描寫史竇歐温追求婚姻真理的經過。據他自己的意見，他説世界上所有的男性與女性都應當在法律上成為好的伴侣。因此，便可以給予了每一個人以一種機會而成為一個有用的「結婚材料」；並且他憑了這種理論來指導一個風流的學校，教授學生們怎樣去浪漫。</p>
<p>事業便如此展開了，但妒嫉心的壞蛋闖了進來，事情便糟了下去，那時的史竇歐温幾乎失掉了他理想的情女，</p>
<p>「婚姻介紹所」為喬治斯梯芬導演，今天在大上海開映。</p>

<p>露蘭貝爾斯費了許多光陰，才弄得一些證據，並且費了許多心思。但是等到她將這證據，在法庭中提岀的時候，法庭受了權要，嗾使，竟不接受她的證據，反將露蘭貝爾斯訴斥了一番。露蘭没有法子，祗好退了岀來。她想着方法，去和這惡勢力繼續奮鬬。她一定要趕快設法，不然就來不及了。</p>
<p>在這露蘭貝爾斯坐着深思的時候，對方的一班人亦正在他們的公事房裏，討論着這件事。他們的談話，是露蘭貝爾斯可以揣想而知的。傑賴憤然地説道：「這老太婆太討厭了。她干涉得過份了。」學校視察員賀倫特連忙答應道：「是的。我亦覺得如此。」傑賴問道：「她的任期，還有多少時候可以叫她告老？」賀倫特道：「照着章程，她的任期還有兩年。」傑賴縐着眉，很不耐煩似的道：「我恐怕我們不能等候自動告老吧……」</p>
<p>露蘭貝爾斯站了起來，到校長室的窗口。天色已經很晚了，但是校長室要電燈還没有開。她站着望外面街上看着。馬路的對面，就是戴德的地方，裏面已是燈燭輝煌，引得行人駐足起來。一回那裏的門開了，一陣音樂，聲音，從裏面散佈了岀來。露蘭貝爾斯的眼光，這時已移轉到戴德地方旁邊的一所空屋，那裏掛着一個「召租」的招牌。她不覺自言自語道：「克拉倫斯戴德，總有一天，那塊招牌會掛在你那房上的。」</p>
<p>校長室的門開了，一陣强烈的光綫從外面射了進來。露蘭貝爾斯連忙回頭，看見她的助教梅立斯走了進來，站在她面前説道：「密司貝爾斯，時候已經不早了。」她答了一聲：「是的，」但是她的思想還在馬路的對面。梅立斯翻着手裏的幾張紙説道：「這裏有幾件事……」露蘭貝爾斯道：「好吧，請你放在我的寫字檯上。我今天晚上看過之後，明天早晨再和你討論好了。」梅立斯答應了，就將手裏的東西放了下來。</p>
<p>他走到門口，又站住了囁嚅着道：「那個戴德的事情，密司貝爾斯……我……我要你知道，我對於你所做的一切，都很佩服……我佩服你有那般勇氣。」露蘭貝爾斯笑着道：「梅立斯先生，謝謝你。」梅立斯又説道：「你對於小孩子這樣盡心盡力，他們却不得好歹。」露蘭貝爾斯道：「哦，那亦不能怪他們。他們去到戴德那裏，就為那個地方好玩。我想並不是喝酒或賭博，引誘他們去那個地方——小孩子，喜歡玩，喜歡快樂，乃是他們的天性……並且……」他不説下去了，因為她的腦筋之中，忽然生岀一個渺茫的計劃。梅立斯有所懷疑似的道：「亦許是如此。密司貝爾斯，今天還有什滬事没有？」貝爾斯道：「没有了。明天見吧。」</p>
<p>梅立斯去後，她的腦筋越是越快，想着剛才的那個新計劃。她走到寫字檯後面，剛想坐下，忽然外面又有人打着門，三個學生跟着走了進來。那三個學生，都是受過校長特别的好處的……華徳，她曾在辯論會中，帮過他許多忙，如同曾經帮過另外一個學生——那個學生現在已經做了大總統了……還有威廉倍登，她曾帮助他温之角，免得他留級，同時使他能繼續足球隊的工作，替亞芳台爾地方奪得了錦標……還有尼泊通……（未完）</p>

<p>本市自受滬戰影響後，租界人口依統計所得；約驟增百分之二十三强，於是小型住宅，弄屋石庫門；遂為衆矢之的，召頂招貼一岀，搶奪者大不乏人，曾親見房屋一所，裝修毫無，而頂費索至六百餘元者，自此可見社會經濟，儘管拮据，此項費用，仍不能消靡，但辦公室店基及其他房屋，問津者實不多，廻顧去年上海房地産事業，發生二種極顯著的傾向，一為高度發展的實現與外灘一帶商協地逐漸向西推廣跑馬廳等處，城中區一段如廣東銀行新厦，四行儲蓄會大厦，永安公司擴充地址鋼架建築，及正在開掘的大新公司，巍巍高聳，幾疑為上海的『華爾街』矣。其餘如公寓（Apartment），在四五層之間者，滬北滬西兩區，建造者均益增進不已，法租界邊境，有若干極高此類公寓建築，不久即將落成，依公共租界一偶而論，此類建築價值，自去年迄今，總數已有二百三十八萬八千一百五十元；計滬東區六零一六零零元，滬北區二三七零零元，中央區八二三四五零元，滬西區九三九四零零元，而崑山路比利時公寓，乍浦路胡司公寓等等均於前二年建就，尚不在統計之中，此類小型而式樣簡單的住房勃興的起因，無非循社會人士的需要，其租金低廉，設備完全的公寓，愈為各界歡迎，尤以二間式或三間，租金自七十五至一百元的一類為最普遍，其中房客除少數外人日僑外，大抵盡為我國房客，例如法租界内有四層式的公寓一所，新近落成，内分一，二，三間不等，現已租賃一空，其中四分之三係華人也，攷此種趨勢的造成，實因公寓之較為便利也，如新式設備，租金包括暖氣自來水及零税等雜費，使日常生活漸趨簡易化，但交通便利，更為一大原因。</p>
<p>我們往常的居住問題，恒以弄屋石庫門為中心前提，各種居住上的困難，也受得够了，公寓式的住宅，正是給與我們一個新生活的改革，住户的漸趨公寓生活，誰説不是本年度的良好現象。</p>
<p>現在，把全市的建築統值五五·八八○·○○○元，比較廿二年，因然是减色了，但上面也曾説過，在一切不晦氣的狀况下，建築雖因人口關係而消長，但社會經濟的恐慌，物價的低落，原是必然的趨勢！所以，在建築上的價值，也稍為低落，這對於上海市整個的建築上，是説不到衰落的，曾記得法國科學研究院院長黎嘉教授，在不久以前的發表言論中，觀察世界人口的趨勢，最近十年内，上海的人口，必定由於現時的佔世界各大城市第七位，超過柏林倫敦莫斯科支加哥之上而進佔到第三位呢，這可見得上海前途的建築發達，正是方興未艾我們更可推測公共租界的建築，將來會移到市中區的建築，事實上的確有可能性，單看去年建築的向市中心區建築，就是一個明證呢！</p>
<p>其次，關於上海市的地産，在過去一年裏也值得我們知道的必要！上海的地産，過去的黄金的時期，到去年已是逐度的衰落了，這並非地産價格的暴落，實在由於從事地産交易的投機家，轉移其眼光，而注重其他的投機，所以，成交的數額，較二十二年减少至百分之七十；查二十二年十一個月裏交易總額，為四千○八十八萬三千八百元，而去年同一時期内，僅祗一千一百八十六萬九千五百五十元，現在，把去年十一個的每月成交數額，寫在下面。一二三三月份為三，七五三，二一·四，○○元，計大西區佔一，四○○，五四六，元，滬西區一，三三五，九一六，元，滬東區四○一，八三五，元，法租界四○八，九一七，元，市區二六○六，○○○元，四五月份總數二，二八八，○○○元，計中央區一，一○○，○○○元，大西區五○七，○○○元，滬西區二六六，○○○元，滬東區一一七，○○○元，法租界二九八，○○○元；六月份和七月份，因為却巧是亢熱的天氣裏，所以，其對地産的交易總額，僅一，七六六，九○○元，除滬戰時一二兩月份相仿外，實為近六年來之最低紀錄，計法租界六六三，九○○元，市區三五五，八○○元，大西區三二○，○○○元，滬西區二二七，○○○元，中央區一二一，○○○元，滬東區七九，二○○元；八九兩月份的交易，較上前兩月稍有加增，總額二·○七五·○○○元，計法租界佔五七八·○○○元，中央區五五○·○○○元，大西區二八六·○○○元，滬西區一一○·○○○元，滬北區四八·○○○元，滬東區四四·○○○元，市區四五九·○○○元；十月份和十一月份，又呈萎凋狀態，總值一·九七六·○○○元，計滬東區八○一·七○○元，大西區四○七·八○○元，滬北區三八○·○○○元，中央區一七二·○○○元，滬西區二五·○○○元，法租界一八九·五○○元，倘使把各區十一個月的成交數額來統計，則大西區二·九二一·三四六元，滬西區一·九六三·九一六元，滬東區一·四四三·七三五元，法租界二·一四三·七一七元中央區一·九四三·○○○元，滬北區四二八·○○○元，市區一·○五六·八○○元，看了上面各區的交易統計，便可明白大西區，滬西區，滬東區的地産，較其他各區來得良好。進固然近年來上海工業的逐漸發達，和農村破産後内地資産者的集中上海，有以致之，但越界築路關係，也其促成上述三區的地産交易良好的又一原因，末了，這篇文字怱怱寫成，當然，是不詳盡的，還希讀者有以教正。</p>
<h3 id="c248">值得注意的「庭心」設計 <a href="#c248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— 枕木</p>
<p>誠然，中國舊式民房之建築，是簡陋的，是呆板的，没有外國的華貴，不及洋房的考究；其缺點有：屋基之膚淺，結構之疏散，材料之耗費，重力之不匀，等等各有已為人所指摘而批駁者。惟記者以為中國民房建築之有所謂「庭心」者，實屬舊式建築中之優異特點，而為普通洋房所無有者，頗值吾人之注意而研究之。</p>
<p>要知中國舊式民房，常以進計：一進者有一正兩廂房，兩進者有口字形之「絞圏」，此外則三進，四進，以至七進，九進不等。每進總有五開間，七開間，九開間，等不一，最少亦有三開間方得謂進；而兩進之間必有「庭心」，「庭心」之大小長短，各有不同，隨地形而相異，或開間較多者，將横闊之「庭心」，用矮牆隔分成三五小「庭心」，各不一致，要之其為「庭心」則一也。</p>
<p>夫「庭心」者，又名「天井」，顧其名而思其義，可得知其為房屋之建築中，空白而露天之方地是也；是種庭心之位置約如上述，其構造則就四邊砌壁之空地上，舖以石皮，或磚塊，其花紋圖案，亦一任己意，而邊縁之石條鑲框，則為千篇一列，固甚簡單也。至其效用方面，則頗為宏大；可以通空氣，透光綫，無黑暗之憂患，無窒塞之弊病，且也名曰「天井」，可以曝晒衣服，盛貯雨水，在鄉間無自來水者，更為上策。果然在洋式的房屋建築中，你看儘是高樓大厦，並無有此項佳點之設計，這是中國人的便宜處，吾人不妨中西合壁起來，在地價平賤的地方，若有偉大之建築，儘宜採用「庭心」，實在便利不少，惟建築上必須進步，其「庭心」之底基，須結實均匀。表面則鋼骨水泥，磁磚，花崗石，甚至草地，等均可，各視經濟能力而定之，而美觀方面，亦須加以設計，方臻完善。</p>
<h3 id="c249">一年來上海建築概况（三） <a href="#c249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— 楊德惠</p>
<p>説到市區裏的建築，我們第一要明白，市區的建築，在過去，是無甚怎樣的發達，自市政府成立後，本是已有蓬勃的氣象，但中間遭着一二八的事件，所以又呈萎凋狀態。戰神固然是可恐怖，究竟人口的逐漸增加，不因環境的關係，終于不久漸趨活躍現象。况且市政府為實現總理的大上海計劃，努力進行，更是激勵市區建築的主因呢！所以在去年市區的建築，已呈發達的趨勢了。在其上年的六個月裏的建築總值，一二·二八三·○○○元，比較二十二年度的建築，增加在百分之四十四；就其近三年來同一時期的總值比較，那末，民二十一年為一·一二三·○○○元，二十一年因一二八事件，只四·○二三·○○○元二十二年為八·五三一·○○○元，這樣的猛增，是市區前途建築的良好現象。在這裏，把建築的分類，計有住房九百十六間，店面一百七十四間，工廠七十五所，棧廳十七所，寫字間十四所，學校二十二所，教堂七所，醫院三所，其他建築六所。就中以浦東火酒精廠建築價值為最大，約四十多萬元，七月份和八月份建築，值四萬三十五萬元左右；九十月份比較稍為减少，但仍有三百四十三萬一千元，計建築住廳三百二十六所，店面六十九間，工廠十五所，棧廳九所，學校三處，寫字辦公房三所，教堂二所，醫院一所，至於十一月份和十二月份，此刻因没統計材料，不敢下怎樣的定值，但從其十個月來建築費的共計。達一八·九二七·○○○元，平均計算，每月也有一八·九二七·○○○元，較之法租界十個月的共計一○·八四一·○○○元，已是超岀其八百萬元左右了。但和公共租界十月來共計二五·二一二·○○○元比較，相差四百多萬元。這因為公共租界的環境關係，所以在全市的新建築上，終可每年首屈一指的。上面曾經説過，公共租界的建築，足可代表上海市的建築，因為是這樣，市區的未來建築，正有待於市民的共同努力呢！值得我們欣幸的。就是去年市區的建築大多趨向市中區一帶的地方，同時和公共租界大西區的界西首，（其實何有有界線，不過照現時警衛行政而説的。）近二年來，已漸成為幽美的住宅區了。閘北的建築，也很發達，這是復興前途的光明現象。</p>

<p>Advocating a Sincere Atmosphere as a Model for All Provinces</p>
<p>Encouraging the Implementation of the New Life Movement to Improve Politics</p>
<p>Telegraphing Sichuan to Properly Plan for the Takeover of Defense Zones</p>
<p>[Hankou] At 9 a.m. on the 25th, Chairman Chiang took a ferry across the Yangtze River from Hankou to attend the General Headquarters Enlarged Memorial Week. Chairman Chiang, Zhang Xueliang, Qian Dajun, Yang Yongtai, He Chengjun, Zhang Qun, Huang Musong, Chen Cheng, Yu Xuezhong, Wan Fulin, Wang Shuchang, Hao Mengling, He Zhuguo, Wang Yizhe, Ye Peng, members of the provincial government, the mayor of Hankou, provincial and municipal party committees, the director and head of the Wuhan Public Security Bureau, and over two hundred school principals all attended to respectfully listen to the instructions. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Hankou] Chairman Chiang's address at the General Headquarters Memorial Week briefly stated that he had several impressions from his visit to Wuhan: (1) Wuhan's atmosphere has not shed the word "sly." Military and government leaders should lead by example and take responsibility for improving the atmosphere. (2) Wuhan's police uniforms are still neat, and there has been progress in municipal administration. However, Qiaokou, Dazhimen, Liujiamiao, and other places are filthy and filled with stench, and many shantytowns are unhygienic. In the future, attention should be paid to the cleanliness of the suburbs, and the health of the poor should also be considered. (3) Uncompleted construction projects should be completed, and completed projects should be carefully protected and improved to meet modernization standards. It should be known that the people's labor is their property and should be utilized. In the future, the people's labor should be used to develop the people's land and increase the people's production. Our country's talents and intelligence are not inferior to foreigners. If we have a continuous and unremitting spirit, eliminate vanity, and focus on practicality, then a great nation with five thousand years of history and four hundred million people will surely reach the realm of prosperity and become a modern country, a modern society, and a modern people. The New Life Movement is about to be established, and I hope to encourage each other with you. Finally, regarding the New Life Movement, I also hope that military and government leaders will continue to promote it, so that Wuhan can become a national model. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Shao Yuanchong: Encouraging Comrades</p>
<p>President Wang: Reporting on Work</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Central Committee held its 71st Memorial Week at 9 a.m. on the 25th. Committee members Shao Yuanchong, Li Zonghuang, Deng Jiayan, Wang Qi, Li Ciwen, etc., and working comrades, totaling over five hundred people, attended. Shao Yuanchong presided over the meeting and gave a report, briefly stating that the Central Committee previously decided to designate February 19th as the New Life Movement Memorial Day. On the afternoon of the same day, Li Zonghuang, Ding Chaowu, and others were appointed to inspect the Party headquarters and agencies. The results of the inspection showed that most departments were generally able to implement cleanliness, orderliness, and punctuality. However, a few departments still need to be further rectified. It is hoped that all comrades can pay close attention and practice what they preach. It must be known that at this time of serious national crisis, Party comrades are responsible for leading and training the masses. Only with orderly and solemn habits in ordinary times can they display the spirit of sacrifice and struggle in times of crisis. In addition to work, attention must also be paid to personal rest and knowledge supplementation. Recently, the Central Committee has been focusing on practical work in national construction, such as universal education, literacy campaigns, and Baojia (household registration) movements. Party comrades should be responsible for implementing these tasks effectively. It is hoped that comrades will work hard to prepare for these tasks, so that work will be interesting in ordinary times and service will be fruitful in times of crisis.

The remaining rivers require a total of over 40,000 yuan, which the provincial government has decided to allocate. Work is scheduled to begin early next month and be completed before the spring flood. As for the Guantai dam closure project, it is still difficult to close the gap due to the rapid rise of the water.

<h3 id="e23">Austrian Prime Minister's Visit to England and France and the Central European Pact <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— A Brief Analysis</p>
<p>Today's European unrest can be broadly attributed to two reasons: first, the shaking of the Versailles Treaty system; second, the struggle for hegemony between France and Italy in Central Europe and the Balkans. The Austrian question is significantly related to both of these.</p>
<p>The Austrian question has long been regarded as the volcano of Europe. Various countries have sought to prevent its eruption for more than a day. However, due to differing interests and intentions, no appropriate solution has been found. It was not until January of this year, when the French Prime Minister personally visited Rome, that the Franco-Italian agreement was established. Its significant achievement was the joint declaration by France and Italy to guarantee the independence of Austria. Subsequently, he visited London, and a draft of the Anglo-French agreement was proposed. Besides security guarantees and disarmament issues, Britain will also participate in discussions and agreements regarding the guarantee of Austrian independence. Recently, Austrian Prime Minister Schuschnigg and Foreign Minister Walter Neustaedter-Stürmer went to Paris and had important talks with French Prime Minister Flandin and Foreign Minister Laval, which attracted worldwide attention. According to a Havas dispatch yesterday, the two countries have reached an agreement. In addition to recognizing the Franco-Italian Rome Agreement, they have confirmed the principles of the Central European Pact. Today, the Austrian Prime Minister is departing for England to seek the opinion of the British. If the Austrian Prime Minister's trip is not in vain and he can obtain a joint declaration from Britain, France, and Italy, guaranteeing its independence politically and assisting its economic recovery, then the Austrian question can be temporarily concluded. At the same time, the European situation will also change accordingly.</p>
<p>Before the war, Austria was a major European power. After the war, due to the penalties of the peace treaty, fertile lands within the country were divided, and important industries were ravaged. Added to the burden of reparations, the country's economy lost its ability to be self-reliant. Financial difficulties were extraordinary, and it was difficult to survive without foreign debt, leading to the title of "international beggar." On the other hand, internal unrest was frequent and disturbances were endless. Last year, the assassination of Prime Minister Dollfuss almost led to international intervention. Austria's current situation is deeply sympathetic to us.</p>
<p>Austria's difficulty lies in its economy. To seek self-rescue, there are only two paths: merging with Germany or coordinating economically with surrounding countries, the so-called Danube Union. The Austro-German merger is not only eagerly desired by Austria but also sought after by Germany. The two countries share the same language and ethnicity, and their situations are similar. If they can merge, they can break through the current predicament. However, it is precisely because of this that it is not allowed by the powers. As of today, the radical activities of the German National Socialist Party have aroused Austria's antipathy, and the merger issue has no possibility of realization.</p>
<p>Secondly, the union of the Danube states is related to the struggle for hegemony between France and Italy. France's foreign policy after the war was to suppress Germany and resist Italy. Therefore, on the one hand, it demanded security guarantees, and on the other hand, it tried to cultivate more allied countries. In addition to the Little Entente countries that have already been under its domination, it cannot ignore the attitude of Austria and Hungary. Therefore, taking advantage of Austria's financial difficulties, it used its own economic advantages to cooperate with them and further unite Hungary. The Danube Plan announced in March 1932 was to form an economic entity among the Danube states. Although it did not succeed, France's intentions are evident.</p>
<p>Italy's desire to control the maritime power of the Adriatic Sea has been long-standing. Before the war, its enemy was Austria. After the war, Yugoslavia rose to replace it. Yugoslavia is one of the Little Entente countries, and behind the Little Entente is France. Therefore, in fact, the dispute between Italy and Yugoslavia is the dispute between France and Italy. France cultivates allied countries, and Italy has to win over Albania, Bulgaria, and others to resist France. And for Austria and Hungary, it also strives to connect with them. This is why the Italy-Austria-Hungary agreement was established in March last year.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Austrian question is a dispute among Germany, France, and Italy. France and Italy do not want to see Austria merge with Germany, nor do they want Austria to be used by the other party. Therefore, there has been no appropriate solution. However, now, due to the common opposition to Germany, the opinions of Britain and France have become consistent, and the relationship between France and Italy has improved. Austria's independence can be jointly guaranteed by the three countries. The Danube Union also has the possibility of being established. Although the unrest in Europe may not be eliminated as a result, it can be asserted that the coordination of Britain, France, and Italy can at least change the European situation.</p>
<p>In addition, what we want to emphasize is that a country's poverty and weakness do not necessarily mean that there is no way to save itself. The key lies in the efforts of the people, working hard, and carefully examining the international struggle situation, and displaying a spirit of not being arrogant or humble. The recent measures of Germany and Austria are indeed worthy of our reference. This is what we cannot help but think of when talking about the Austrian Prime Minister's visit to England and France.</p>

<p>[London] Dr. Kurt Schuschnigg, the Austrian Chancellor, and his entourage, secretly arrived in London this evening. They were greeted at the station by Foreign Secretary Sir John Simon and Ambassador Kölln. Three hundred members of the Socialist and Communist parties planned to demonstrate at the station, but by the time they arrived, Schuschnigg and his party had already left fifteen minutes earlier. When Schuschnigg and his party departed from Paris, they did not keep it secret. French Premier Flandin and Foreign Minister Laval both came to the station to see them off. It happened to be a Sunday, so there were many people idly watching at the station. Schuschnigg and his party are scheduled to return home on Tuesday. During their short stay in London, they plan to meet with Simon and other political leaders, as well as Montagu Norman, the Governor of the Bank of England. (Reuters, 24th)</p>

<p>[London] Montagu Norman, the Governor of the Bank of England, recently met with Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg. This morning, Schuschnigg and Foreign Minister Berger-Waldenegg met with members of the British Cabinet. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>[London] Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg and Foreign Minister Berger-Waldenegg arrived here today and will soon hold meetings with British officials. The future of Austria will hinge on the outcome of these meetings. Schuschnigg and Berger-Waldenegg have already met with French authorities several times. They have come here to ascertain what action Britain will take if the National Socialist Party interferes in Austrian affairs again. The points that Schuschnigg presented to British Foreign Secretary Simon will likely be the same as those he made to French Premier Flandin last week. That is, if Britain and France do not agree to help Austria, then Austria must abandon its democratic government and restore the Habsburg monarchy. Although there has been no indication of the outcome of Schuschnigg's meeting with France, observers here generally believe that France has at least agreed to cooperate in principle to guarantee Austria's independence. France has lent Austria millions of francs, so the future of the Austrian government is of great concern to France. Britain is also very concerned because Schuschnigg is a monarchist and has openly stated that the restoration of the Habsburg monarchy would eliminate the threat of the National Socialist Party to the government. In short, the question Schuschnigg asked the British and French authorities was: "If the National Socialist Party tries to overthrow the Austrian government again, whether this action is directly or indirectly supported by the German government, what will you do?" Because Italy has declared its support for Austria being free from external control, Schuschnigg is eager to obtain the approval of Britain and France to provide financial and military assistance if necessary, so as to maintain the current state of Austria's democratic political system. The arrival of Schuschnigg and Berger-Waldenegg in France was quite tumultuous, but their arrival here was very quiet. The two arrived at Victoria Station at 5:25 p.m. British officials went to the station to welcome them and escorted them to their hotel. It is said that the meetings will be very short and will end soon. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>British Left-Wing Demonstration [London] A mass rally organized by left-wing parties to aid the unemployed was recently held in Hyde Park. A motion was passed demanding the expulsion of Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg, stating that Schuschnigg is a dictator of the Austrian Fatherland Front and should not be allowed to come to Britain. After the rally, several thousand demonstrators planned to leave Hyde Park and go to Victoria Station to demonstrate against the Austrian Chancellor when he got off the train, but they were stopped by the police, who did not allow the demonstrators to leave Hyde Park. The demonstrators then sang the Internationale in the hope that their voices would be heard at the station. The crowd was not allowed to leave Hyde Park until a quarter of an hour after the Austrian officials had disembarked. (Havas, Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Austrian Chancellor's Farewell Speech [Paris] Before his departure, Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg delivered a radio broadcast, bidding farewell to the French people. He said that he was deeply grateful for the sincere welcome that French public opinion had given him during his visit. France and Austria are linked by centuries of civilization and virtue, and it can be seen that Austria will always carry out its mission of coordination and peace, in order to guarantee the peace that is currently being pursued. French Foreign Minister Laval then gave a speech following Schuschnigg, expressing satisfaction with the work completed during the Franco-Austrian talks. He said that the two countries share a consensus on the main issues of European peace, and that agreement had been reached in principle on the Danube Pact plan, which all countries that are committed to peace should also support. The Austrian officials have now departed from Paris and are on their way to London. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>Telegraph to French Authorities Expressing Gratitude [Paris] Austrian Foreign Minister Berger-Waldenegg telegraphed French Foreign Minister Laval when he disembarked at Boulogne, expressing his satisfaction with the sincerity and cordiality of the talks held in Paris. His closing remarks were, "With our two countries working together, we will surely be able to lay the foundation for European peace, and the sovereignty and dignity of all countries will be respected." At the same time, Chancellor Schuschnigg telegraphed Premier Flandin, saying that he was very pleased to have been so well received in France, and that although the visit was short, the existing sincere relationship between France and Austria would be even closer. Premier Flandin immediately telegraphed London to express his thanks, saying that the French government and people are unwavering in their commitment to Austria's independence and prosperity.

<p>Surrenders Arms to Show Submission</p>
<p>Leaders Vow on Their Honor</p>
<p>[Vienna] The National Socialist Party in Upper Austria has surrendered. Various groups of the Hitler Party have decided to cease all political activities and have disbanded the Hitler Youth and Stormtroopers and other military groups. The leaders of each National Socialist Party issued an oath to the head of the detective team, pledging on their honor to assist in dissolving the party's various groups. Throughout Upper Austria, National Socialists have surrendered to local authorities. For example, in Braunau am Inn, Hitler's hometown, and Linz, a stronghold of the National Socialist Party, the National Socialists have handed over a large number of military weapons and radio materials. However, many people fear that the National Socialists are outwardly submitting but are secretly plotting to subvert the Fatherland Front in order to cause trouble from within. Colonel Adam, the leader of the Fatherland Front, issued a declaration to the surrendered National Socialists, stating, "If you wish to join the Fatherland Front, then you must support an independent Austria that adheres to Catholicism, practices professional corporatism, and belongs to German culture. What should be noted now is whether you have changed your ideology and abandoned Hitler's theories. If you only stop using explosives and replace them with propaganda to destroy Austria, then you are merely changing your methods and not changing your political program." (Havas, 25th)</p>

<p>Warsaw Most newspapers here have refrained from commenting on the recent visit of British cabinet members to Warsaw, as the situation regarding the negotiations between Britain, France, Germany, and Russia is not yet clear. Poland does not want to make any statements in advance that would bind it. It is generally expected that Britain will propose a compromise on the issue of the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact. According to a correspondent for the "Berliner Tageblatt" in London, it has been proposed to change the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact to an Eastern European Consultation Pact. This Consultation Pact could be based on non-aggression treaties between Eastern European countries. Poland has already signed non-aggression treaties with Germany and the Soviet Union. Other Eastern European countries that have not yet signed non-aggression treaties could sign them separately, and then all Eastern European countries could jointly sign a Consultation Pact, so that the various non-aggression treaties would be interconnected, thus replacing the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact.

<p>Munich Celebrates at Birthplace by Hanging Flags</p>
<p>Munich Fifteen years ago today, after the German Revolution in the European War, the laws and regulations were in disarray, and the country was barely a country. Hitler first advocated National Socialism, and its first public congress was held in the Hofbräuhaus in Munich. At that time, the entire city was plastered with advertisements for the National Socialist Congress. About two thousand people gathered at the Hofbräuhaus to listen to Hitler's speech, but very few of them understood National Socialism. Most of them came out of curiosity, and some were enemies of the new movement. However, Hitler was skilled at rhetoric and was extremely enthusiastic. At the conclusion of the congress, the twenty-five articles of National Socialism were passed and promulgated, becoming the platform of the National Socialist Party. This was the turning point in Germany's national fortune fifteen years ago. Today, National Socialism has permeated the entire country, and the fifteenth anniversary is being celebrated throughout the country. Munich, as the birthplace of National Socialism, is celebrating even more enthusiastically. All the buildings in the city have been decorated with flags, and Hess, Hitler's right-hand man, came to the Hofbräuhaus, where Hitler first announced National Socialism fifteen years ago, to speak to the public. The main points of Hess's speech were that the mission of National Socialism is the legacy of the soldiers who sacrificed their lives for their country in the European War. During the European War, the front-line soldier Hitler was the first National Socialist to fight in the front lines. Today, the leader is also leading by example, fighting for the interests and future of the country as the first citizen. Hess paused briefly at this point, so that those who did not want to participate in the oath could leave automatically, so that the masses could swear together. The words were, "I unconditionally obey those appointed by Hitler and all his leaders. I solemnly swear." After the masses had sworn, German leader Hitler himself came to the Hofbräuhaus to speak to everyone. His speech was very long. First, he recounted the history of the National Socialist Party's fifteen years of struggle. During Hitler's speech, the audience repeatedly stood up, applauded, and cheered. Hitler said that his initiation of the National Socialist movement was not the creation of something new, but simply the awakening of good German citizens who were sleeping soundly. Hitler then briefly described the state of Germany before the November Revolution. At that time, public morality was declining day by day, and the corruption of public administration had reached its peak. Embezzlement and bribery were rampant, and the law was non-existent. The National Socialist movement did not have a strong backing, but only fought to the death with the left wing with bare hands, while the right-wing parties ridiculed and watched from the sidelines. He himself had to constantly eliminate deeply ingrained elements of doubt on the left and right. After the things he predicted gradually came true, he was gradually able to gain the trust of the people. The belief in political power cannot be solely promulgated by those in high positions, but must be gradually built up by the people's belief. Although the National Socialist Party has now seized the power of the state, its mission has not yet been completed, and its importance has not diminished. Therefore, the party is only a motor that can generate power and drive the entire country forward to complete its purpose and intention. Hitler finally requested that the old comrades continue to strive for the honor of the country and the equal rights of nations, and said that Germany should respond "yes" to calls for international cooperation to safeguard peace, but should respond "no" to arguments that deny equality.

<p>[Moscow] The 17th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Union's Workers' and Peasants' Red Army is considered an important event by the national press and the working masses. An editorial in Izvestia stated, "The Soviet state's foreign policy has its own fixed line, which is the line of peace. This line is sufficient to explain the actions of the Soviet government and its diplomatic organs on the international stage. However, if we only rely on verbal statements and promises, then it is an open sin, because at a time when the aggressive tendencies of several countries are increasing, we must have practical self-defense guarantees. The Red Army is the backbone of our armed state. If imperialist gentlemen want to repeat their old tricks, then they will surely be able to show their great power. The solidarity of the Soviet workers is stronger than ever before. Their army is the protector of the oppressed masses, the protector of peace, and the weapon of the victorious proletariat. It is like an impregnable wall, and it is as inseparable as life from the party, the government, and our country's leader, the organizer of the glorious victory of proletarian socialism in war and peace, Stalin." People's Commissar of Defense Voroshilov wrote in a letter, "The Red Army is always strong and always ready to defend its beloved goals. Today, war technology and knowledge of our country's wealth have doubled the revolutionary spirit, so we are more confident in guarding the proletarian borders." (TASS, 23rd)</p>

<p>Youth Compulsory Military Training</p>
<p>Neutral Countries Trend Toward Nationalism</p>
<p>Swiss Capital The bill to extend the years of military service in Switzerland has been passed by the Federal Assembly. It has now been voted on by the citizens in a referendum according to constitutional procedure. The result was a majority of 506,845 votes to 431,902 votes in favor. Before this referendum on the bill, there was much propaganda against the bill throughout the country. The Communist Party and some members of the Socialist Party believed that aircraft would play an important role in future wars and that extending the years of military service would not be helpful, so they strongly opposed it. However, the bill was finally passed in the referendum. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>Zurich, Switzerland Today, Switzerland has passed the reorganization of the army. This case was voted on by the people of the whole country, with 485,000 votes in favor and 421,700 against. Traditionally, Switzerland has been peaceful, but according to this government order, compulsory military training for young people will also be increased, i.e., cavalry training will be increased from 92 days to 102 days, infantry training will be increased from 77 days to 88 days, and engineering training will be increased from 67 days to 88 days. Young people are required to receive military training when they reach a certain age, but no standing army is established. Therefore, what was voted on this time was to increase the period of this training. The proposal was put forward by the government and passed by Congress on September 24 last year. However, because the Socialist Party and the Communist Party strongly opposed it, the people of the whole country voted on it again. Switzerland has always adhered to neutrality, and its four million people all adhere to peace. Officials say that the increase in the number of military training days is not an expression of war, but only an increase in the technical needs of training. The people's vote in favor is also an expression of trust in the government and has no military significance. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>[Geneva] The bill to extend the years of military service in Switzerland was voted on by the citizens in a referendum yesterday, with a majority of more than 500,000 votes to 430,000 votes in favor. Today, the newspapers here have commented on it one after another. "The Swiss Newspaper" said that the number of votes against yesterday's vote was quite large. This is because the Swiss farmers are living in poverty and cast negative votes to express their dissatisfaction. Most farmers support the extension of the military service period, but they cast a negative vote to express their protest because they are dissatisfied with the status quo. "The Geneva Daily" believes that nationalism has won a victory, which is very gratifying. "The Labor Newspaper" of the Socialist Party said that the canton of Geneva voted in favor of the bill by a majority, which was very unexpected. Most people must be against the extension of the military service period. (Havas, 25th)</p>

The party is still in power because Suriyong holds military power. It is said that although Suriyong was shot twice in the arm and neck, his injuries are not life-threatening, and the assassin has escaped. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the rumors of the assassination attempt on Siamese Defense Minister Suriyong Rangsrikj in Bangkok, those around the Siamese King here do not want to comment.

Although he has never served as the leader of the opposition party, he has always opposed the King with the power of the military. It is also said that most Siamese people hope that the Siamese King will return to the country, but the Siamese King has said that a truly democratic government must be organized so that the people can freely express their opinions before he will agree to return.

<h3 id="e78">Paraguay Explains Reason for Withdrawing from League <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Dissatisfied with League of Nations Mediation Proposals</p>
<p>Abuse of Power Fuels Aggression</p>
<p>Withdrawal Effective Two Years After Notification</p>
<p>[Geneva] League of Nations authorities announced today that they have received Paraguay's notification of withdrawal from the League, the reason being dissatisfaction with the League's Chaco armistice proposal. According to regulations, formal withdrawal will only take effect two years after the League receives the notification. Therefore, Paraguay is still subject to League control for now. (24th National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Geneva] The South American Republic of Paraguay has declared its withdrawal from the League of Nations. In a telegram to the League, it stated the reasons for its withdrawal, roughly as follows: "Paraguay did not reject the resolution passed by the League of Nations Assembly on November 24, 1934, to resolve the Chaco dispute, but requested that the main points of the resolution be reconsidered and that points conflicting with the Paraguayan constitution be removed. However, the League of Nations Chaco Incident Advisory Committee considered the Paraguayan government's request to be equivalent to rejecting the resolution and decided to adopt pre-determined sanctions. Regarding the arms embargo to the belligerent countries, Bolivia initially protested, but Paraguay acknowledged it as a legitimate measure, as it is a just action for a neutral country to exercise its sovereignty to stop the war. However, despite Paraguay's request, the League of Nations did not order an investigation into war responsibility. The Advisory Committee rescinded the resolution to embargo arms to Bolivia and imposed a unilateral arms embargo on Paraguay as retaliation. The League of Nations' abuse of power fuels the arrogance of aggressor nations, allowing them to achieve what they could not achieve with their original military force. The Advisory Committee's decision is an arbitrary action. Paraguay, as a member of the League of Nations, believes that its obligations should be limited to those specified in the Covenant and that it should enjoy equal treatment with other nations. Therefore, the Paraguayan government hereby formally notifies its withdrawal from the League of Nations." (24th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[Geneva] Paraguay's notification of withdrawal from the League of Nations has been delivered to the League today. The deadline set by the League Assembly to adopt a solution to the Chaco dispute, limited to three months, has now expired. Therefore, under the League of Nations Covenant, Bolivia is now in a state of legal war, while Paraguay's position is illegal. However, the League of Nations may not adopt extreme measures such as severing commercial and diplomatic relations with Paraguay, as stipulated in the League of Nations Covenant, as it is expected that the United States and Brazil will not approve of such measures. At the same time, there is still hope for South American countries to mediate. According to news from the capital of Paraguay today, the Paraguayan government's communication to the League of Nations stated that the League completely ignored Paraguay's request to determine responsibility for the Chaco dispute, so the League no longer has the right to impose sanctions.

<p>Ready to Serve as Navy at Any Time When Necessary</p>
<p>Large Numbers of Troops and Supplies Continuously Heading to East Africa</p>
<p>Rumor Says Italy Has Accepted Idea of Establishing Neutral Zone in Principle</p>
<p>[Rome] Italy's war preparations are intensifying today. The cabinet passed an order stipulating the organization of a merchant fleet, which can summon all capable ships and sailors in times of emergency. Previously, the government repeatedly issued clear orders stipulating methods for national men to enlist for service and dispatched 6,000 troops to Italian Somaliland to assist local troops in defending the border. It is said that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's new decree to assemble a merchant fleet and personnel is of global significance. Some forces in the United States are also demanding the passage of bills to control wartime industry and finance, which is similar to this order. Mussolini has already drafted measures for the government to take over industry when necessary. Observers say that the government's continuous issuance of decrees by Mussolini has made Italy the most prepared country in the world. Since the issuance of this order, merchant ships can be summoned to serve as the navy at any time. (25th National News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Naples - A division of troops stationed in the Brolida area was partially dispatched yesterday. Led by General Graziani, commander-in-chief of the East African Expeditionary Force, and staff, they sailed to Africa aboard the "Volcano" mail ship. The remaining troops of the division were then transported to Messina today by the "Count Biancamano," and then transferred to another ship to sail to Africa. The "Count Biancamano" carried 3,600 soldiers, 100 officers, and 3,000 tons of military supplies. The crowd cheered as it set sail. Also, the mail ship "Naissa Salaro" has now departed from Lombardy, carrying workers, food, and military supplies, and will depart tomorrow. At the same time, the Vinci here will also depart with workers for the port of Messina, and then transfer to East Africa. Therefore, from tomorrow, the port of Messina will be extremely congested with troops and military supplies transported from various provinces. Prime Minister Mussolini may personally inspect Messina when they depart. (24th Havas Telegram)</p>

It is generally believed that if the Italian government does not respond to Abyssinia's request to submit the dispute to arbitration, the Abyssinian king intends to refer the case to the League of Nations.

<p>Reading of Two Sisters' Tearful Wills</p>
<p>Court Rules Suicide Due to Derangement</p>
<p>[London] The inquest into the deaths of the two sisters who died in a plane crash in Essex, England, on February 21st, opened today. The coroner ruled that they committed suicide due to mental derangement. According to the testimony of the two sisters' father, the US Consul General in Naples, Mr. Bowes, the younger daughter was in love with aviation officer Mr. Forbes. After Mr. Forbes died in an airship accident, the daughter was greatly saddened. Also, according to the pilot of the plane the two sisters were in, even if he had seen the two sisters trying to jump out, he would not have been able to stop them. The coroner then read two letters left by the two sisters in the plane to their parents, stating that the two sisters were deeply in love with Mr. Forbes and aviation officer Mr. Pettie, who died with Forbes. One letter also stated that Mr. Forbes had been engaged to a certain woman, but promised to break off the engagement and marry the younger daughter this summer. One passage stated that the daughters hoped their parents would know that they would be with Forbes forever in the afterlife and that they would fulfill their promise. The sentiments were so tearful that one could not bear to finish reading them. The two sisters' father had requested that the two letters not be published, as he wished to read them with his wife and not let outsiders know. However, the coroner said that they must be read in court because they were directly related to the two sisters' deaths. He also said, "I cannot stop the newspapers from publishing them."

<p>Made of Micro-Blue and Yellow Colored Lenses</p>
<p>Wearing Them Gives a Three-Dimensional Feeling When Watching Movies</p>
<p>[Paris] Auguste Lumière (last name), the famous physicist who is over seventy years old, has recently invented a "magic" pair of glasses, the result of which will greatly revolutionize movies. Lumière was one of the inventors of cinema. He has found two colors among one thousand five hundred colors and made lenses separately to prepare glasses. Using them to view a photo, you can see the image of the real thing and have a three-dimensional feeling. One of these lenses has a slight blue tint, through which all green, yellow, orange, and red pigments can pass. The other has a slight yellow tint, through which all green, purple, indigo, and blue pigments can pass. In this way, all the pigments in sunlight are complete. When the two lenses are mixed, the viewer only sees white, which is no different from natural light, so the eyes will not be fatigued. Lumière is scheduled to show a film taken based on the above principles at the National Academy of Sciences next Monday. All members of the Academy of Sciences will wear specially made two-color glasses. The viewing experience will be profound, because if there is a scene of a train speeding in the film, coupled with the three-dimensional feeling, it is as if it is about to jump out of the screen and rush towards the viewer.

<p>Annual Sales Reach 1.5 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Monthly Consumption Reaches 110,000 People</p>
<p>Changchun Correspondence: Changchun is the location of the puppet capital and the main base of the Japanese. The opium retail stores in the city have had the highest sales of any city since they opened in April 1933. At that time, there were only about 20 businesses operating in this industry. In May of the same year, the puppet Monopoly Bureau designated another 26 stores one after another. Monthly sales were about 110,000 taels. Since then, the number of addicts has increased day by day. According to statistics from the puppet Special Municipal Government, by February of last year, the number of opium retail stores in the city had increased to 38, and monthly sales had reached more than 146,000 yuan. Sales surged around March, breaking through 290,000 yuan, the highest record of the year. Looking at the statistics, the average number of smokers per month last year was about 100,000, and the sales amount was mostly above 100,000 yuan. The number of smokers, the amount of raw opium and prepared opium sold, and the amount of money involved in each month are recorded below, so that the situation of opium consumption in the city can be seen.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Guangzhou City Maintains Municipal Bank Notes <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Borrowing Money from Foreign Banks in Hong Kong for Redemption</p>
<p>Full Use of Municipal Bank Notes Restored</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Municipal Bank in this city issues municipal bank notes, divided into one yuan, five yuan, and ten yuan denominations. The credit of these notes is solid, and the citizens have always been happy to use them. Moreover, because the total amount issued is not large, and the monthly municipal tax revenue guarantees them, there have been no financial panics over the years. However, last year, the city treasury's expenditures were too large, and cash flow was not smooth. The municipal notes suddenly experienced a discount panic. The Municipal Bank owns many real estate properties, but due to the economic exhaustion of society, all properties could not be sold at once, so the municipal notes could not be maintained and were discounted to about 80%. It has been more than half a year since then. Although there has been a slight rise recently, a one-yuan municipal note is only worth 90%. The municipal authorities believed that if the municipal notes were discounted for a long time, it would inevitably lead to public and private difficulties. At the beginning of this month, they proceeded to borrow a large sum of money for the full redemption of municipal notes. At that time, special personnel were sent to Hong Kong to negotiate with a foreign bank several times to borrow money. A solution has already been negotiated and a contract can be signed soon. It is heard that the money borrowed by the Municipal Bank from a foreign bank in Hong Kong is about HK$1.3 million, equivalent to about 1.7 million Cantonese dollars. The interest is calculated according to ordinary terms, stating that the principal and interest will be repaid in six months, about 200,000 each month. The newly reclaimed land in Henan Inner Harbor is used as collateral. After this news spread, the banking industry in the city, believing that the municipal notes were maintained by a large loan, purchased the municipal notes one after another. Therefore, the municipal notes, which had been discounted to 90%, have risen back to 94% since the 18th, not far from their full value. Furthermore, the municipal government previously changed the collection of municipal tax revenue to half municipal notes and half cash in order to make up for the low discount of municipal notes. Now that the municipal notes will return to their full value, it is reasonable not to collect half notes and half cash again. It specially issued an order to the municipal tax collection agencies and subordinate units on the 19th, saying: "This government previously stipulated that all municipal agencies should temporarily collect half in silver coins and half in paper money in order to maintain finance and adapt to the environment, and it was submitted to the provincial government for approval. Now, in order to facilitate transportation, from this day on, all types of revenue from all agencies under municipal jurisdiction, where Guangdong Provincial Bank兑现券兑现券 (exchangeable notes), municipal bank notes, and silver coins are used to pay, should be accepted uniformly in order to simplify matters. In addition to reporting to the branch and issuing a notice, this order is issued for immediate compliance and for all subordinate units to comply." This order (20th).</p>

<p>Family Tragedy: Iron Chains Lock Up; Escape and Report</p>
<p>Farmer Chen Zhaolin from Yujia Alley, Qibao Town, West Shanghai, is over half a century old and has only one son, named Zhiwen, aged thirty-two. Zhiwen had already married. Zhaolin has an elder brother, Zhaogen, who has no offspring, so Zhiwen was designated as the joint heir. However, Zhiwen is by nature weak and does not engage in production, often asking his father for money to use, which aroused Zhaolin's anger. The night before last, Zhaolin and Zhaogen, taking advantage of Zhiwen being asleep, used iron chains to lock his hands and feet, confining him in a room. They also used a red-hot poker to burn his lower body, for a total of three days. Later, the clan devised a way to rescue him, and he fled to the Sixth Police Station of the town to report the crime. Police Chief Sun Shinai, after receiving the report, immediately dispatched a senior police officer to arrest Chen Zhaolin and Chen Zhaogen. Considering the case involves private torture, which is cruel and inhumane, he immediately prepared a document and forwarded it to the Songjiang County Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<p>Minutes of the Chamber of Commerce Executive Committee Meeting</p>
<p>The County Chamber of Commerce held an executive meeting today (the 25th), chaired by Cai Zhongyu. Matters discussed: (1) Executive Committee Member Shen Sinan proposed that this county borders Zhejiang Province, and communication between the two sides is quite convenient. Since the long-distance telephone service from Zhejiang was interrupted last year, it has been quite inconvenient. Should the Chamber request the county government to forward a request to the ministry to immediately open the service for commercial information purposes? The resolution was passed as proposed. (2) The Provincial Government Secretariat urged the completion of survey forms for the banking and money industries. How should this be handled? The resolution was that Shu Baoshan would be assigned to distribute and collect the forms for the money industry, and the Chamber would distribute and collect the forms for the banking industry. (3) The county government ordered the completion of survey forms for industry, commerce, and finance. The resolution was to complete them as instructed. (4) Committee Member Sun Shaochi made a temporary motion regarding the electricity meter usage rate, which has doubled compared to before, causing significant losses for users. How should this be handled? The resolution was that the Chamber should send a letter to the electricity company stating that when re-calibrating electricity meters with doubled usage rates for users, it is necessary to invite local government and academic organizations to supervise.</p>

The county government then sent personnel to the bank for inquiry, and the actual amount was only over 600 yuan. The police were immediately dispatched to summon Wang to the government for questioning, but Wang refused to comply. County Magistrate Peng, believing that the district chief had misappropriated district funds and disregarded the law, first dismissed him and ordered an investigation. The district chief's duties are temporarily assumed by Assistant Ji Dingchen.

<p>Robbery and Stabbing of Elderly Woman in Southern Suburbs</p>
<p>Shao Ziyi, the current deputy mayor of Qingming Town, lives in Shaoxiang, near Qingming Bridge outside the South Gate, and is from a moderately well-off family. His wife, Lu, is seventy years old this year. During the New Year, his son, Xinle, held a birthday celebration for her. On the morning of the day before yesterday, four strong men suddenly came to the alley, forcibly demanding money and rice, which they received and left. At eight o'clock that evening, the four strong men suddenly frantically knocked on the Shao's door. When the door was opened, one person stood guard outside, while three others rushed in, immediately tying Lu's eyes with a black cloth and producing a letter, which roughly stated, "Our army lacks military pay and needs to borrow 2,000 yuan in silver dollars. We will send Special Agent Yang to collect it in person," and so on. When she was tied up, Mrs. Lu shouted for help, and the bandits stabbed her in the left waist with a sharp knife, penetrating several inches. Ziyi sneaked outside the door and shouted for thieves. Neighbors heard the alarm and immediately sounded gongs to alert the public. The bandits, unable to loot, fled through the door. Afterwards, Mrs. Shao's son, Shao Xinle, carried her to Puhua Hospital for treatment. Due to the severe injury and excessive bleeding, there is concern for her life.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Discussing the Construction of Gan'an Salt Warehouses: Better to Build in Jiujiang and Wucheng than in Jiujiang and Hukou. <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Shenbiao</p>
<p>I. Introduction</p>
<p>The Salt Affairs Inspection Office, in its effort to reform the national salt administration, plans to designate locations in the four provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi to construct warehouses as a permanent solution. This plan has been approved by the Ministry of Finance and is being implemented separately. The designated locations in Hunan, Hubei, and Anhui are well-suited for controlling the provinces' water and land transportation and sales, so no significant impact has occurred. However, the designation of Jiujiang and Hukou in Jiangxi Province has caused concern. The original intention of the Inspection Office was likely that both locations are gateways to Jiangxi Province, situated on the south bank of the Yangtze River. Jiujiang, with the Nanxun Railway, controls the province's land transportation hub. Hukou, with the Gan River, controls the province's shipping artery, making it convenient for both water and land transportation, benefiting both officials and the people. However, according to the majority of Jiangxi people, Jiujiang is a strategic location and the main hub for land routes, making its construction appropriate. However, Hukou is located on the edge of Jiangxi, obstructed by the dangers of Poyang Lake, which is beneficial for transporting goods into the warehouse by steamer but unfavorable for transporting goods out of the warehouse by sailboat. In the future, commercial transportation will inevitably be difficult, especially for the counties in northern Jiangxi that rely on sailboats as their primary means of transportation, making the journey circuitous and distant. It would be better to build in Wucheng, which controls the end point of all rivers in Jiangxi, historically serving as the gathering place for goods and products from the counties in northern Jiangxi, making it convenient for commercial navigation without hindering official transportation. Currently, it is reported that chambers of commerce and shipping associations in related counties are sending telegrams to the salt administration authorities, urging them to consider commercial navigation and change the original plan to build warehouses in Hukou. The future of salt administration cannot blindly follow public opinion and should be based on facts. Therefore, I have consulted historical records, examined maps, and considered what I have heard and seen to compare the advantages and disadvantages of Hukou and Wucheng, carefully weighing the future benefits and harms. I also believe that building warehouses in Wucheng would be more beneficial than building them in Hukou. Although national policies are the prerogative of the government, how dare I overstep my bounds and offer frivolous comments, inviting criticism for a commoner discussing politics? However, even humble opinions should not be disregarded by poets, and rivers should not be inferior to the sea. This humble opinion, though offered by myself, is subject to the judgment of those in power. Moreover, the Ministry of Finance's Salt Affairs Research Association has proposed to collect materials domestically for the purpose of reorganizing salt administration, so I have presented my arguments as follows. As for building warehouses in Jiujiang, which is convenient for both officials and the people, I will not elaborate further.</p>
<p>II. Hukou is Unsuitable for Building Salt Warehouses</p>
<p>To clarify this point, I will elaborate as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Unfavorable in terms of transportation and sales. Hukou faces the Yangtze River, and steamers can reach it directly without the risk of running aground. As the government is determined to eliminate long-standing malpractices and reduce shipping costs, it is naturally very convenient for official transportation into the warehouse. However, as it concerns national welfare and people's livelihood, the government should choose the most convenient and beneficial option while also considering commercial transportation. Moreover, Hukou warehouse salt will naturally focus on sales to the counties in northern Jiangxi. Investigations have shown that rivers flowing through Tonggu, Xiushui, Wuning, and other counties, as well as the Xiushui River passing through Yongxiu and De'an, and the Fengshui River traversing Fengxin, Jing'an, and Anyi, are mostly shallow with many shoals, and the primary means of transportation relies on sailboats. These sailboats, known as "sparrows," can only be propelled by oars and sails to reach Wucheng. It is difficult for them to brave the wind and waves and navigate the dangerous Poyang Lake. Since official transportation is limited to entering the warehouse, commercial transportation must inevitably cross Poyang Lake. The inability of sailboats to safely cross the lake is a certainty. In the future, commercial transportation in the counties of northern Jiangxi will inevitably rely on steamers to transport goods to Wucheng before they can be loaded onto sailboats. During this process of transferring from steamers to sailboats, if transshipment stations are set up along the way, it will be costly and time-consuming, and the price of salt will increase, placing a heavy burden on our people. If goods are transferred on the riverbank, the risks are high, and if misfortune occurs, commercial capital will be severely damaged. Neither option is desirable.</p>
<p>(2) Unfavorable in terms of terrain. Hukou is the throat of Jiangxi Province, and its strategic location is valued by military strategists. Historical records clearly describe this. Standing in the area, one can see the scars of war. After the Taiping Rebellion in the late Qing Dynasty and the army of Yuan Shikai during the early Republic, the gains and losses of Hukou determined the success or failure of military campaigns. Hukou stands tall along the river, a natural strategic location. While it may not be particularly advantageous for offense, it is truly "one man guarding the pass, ten thousand men cannot pass" for defense. In recent times, with the world situation becoming increasingly tense, statesmen are preparing for the worst. This should be taken into consideration. Salt is an essential food for the people, and its presence brings stability, while its absence leads to chaos. This is evidenced by the recent suppression of bandits, which, despite years of relentless warfare, remained ineffective. However, the implementation of a blockade policy led to the bandits' collapse. This demonstrates the importance of salt.</p>
<p>(3) Unfavorable in terms of warehouse base and expenses. Hukou is a small mountain town with a narrow terrain. I have been there before and found that, apart from residential houses and shops, it is difficult to find a suitable base for building a warehouse within or outside the city. Although there is some vacant land along the river, the terrain is low-lying and prone to flooding. Building a warehouse there would require land reclamation. Other areas are rocky and difficult to level. In my humble opinion, whether it involves reclaiming low-lying areas or leveling rocky areas, building a large-scale warehouse would cost no less than tens of thousands of taels of gold. At a time when the national treasury is depleted, it is not a worthwhile undertaking.</p>
<p>(4) Unfavorable in terms of sales. Jiujiang and Hukou are located opposite each other and both are state-owned, so there are no boundaries. This is unlike the past when merchants competed for sales. However, "everyone loves goodness." This has always been the case and is especially true today. In the future, the personnel in charge of the two warehouses may inevitably compete for superiority in performance evaluations or other matters, so it is necessary to prevent conflicts regarding sales.

<h3 id="e120">Municipal Chamber of Commerce and Three Other Organizations Telegraph to Request Cessation of Auction of Shenxin No. 7 Factory <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The Factory's Assets are Worth Five Million Yuan</p>
<p>Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) Intends to Auction Today</p>
<p>The No. 7 Factory of Shenxin Textile General Company, located at No. 468 Yangshupu Road, mortgaged two million yuan to the British-owned HSBC. Upon expiration without redemption, the bank is auctioning it off. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce and three other organizations have telegraphed to request a cessation. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>HSBC Entrusts Auction Announcement: Lu Yishi, Moore &amp; Co., entrusted by HSBC, announced that the bank, entrusted by the first mortgagee, will auction off 68 mu of valuable real estate located in the eastern district of the city, along with buildings constructed on the land and machinery inside the buildings, which are listed in the mortgage documents, belonging to the No. 7 Factory of Shenxin Textile Company, at 3:30 PM on the 26th in front of the bank on Beijing Road. The reserve price for this property is 2.25 million silver dollars. Offers below this amount will not be considered. The land is registered under English registers 8386, 8387, 8388, and 9654. Those who wish to inspect the title deeds and mortgage documents should contact the bank's general manager in writing. Furthermore, the buyer must pay the full price within two weeks of the auction. The highest bidder will be the buyer. If there is a dispute between two or more bidders, the auction will be immediately reopened at the bank's discretion. Once the auction is finalized, the buyer must, in addition to signing a sales contract, immediately deposit 10,000 silver dollars with the bank. If the buyer fails to fulfill the terms of the bank's auction regulations, this amount will be forfeited, and the bank will still have the right to enforce all the terms of the sales contract.</p>
<p>Three Organizations Telegraph to Request Cessation: (1) Respectfully to the Executive Yuan, Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Ministry of Judicial Administration in Nanjing: According to a letter from Shenxin Textile Company, the company's No. 7 Factory, with assets worth five million yuan, mortgaged two million yuan to HSBC. Upon expiration, the company was willing to pay all interest and part of the mortgage principal, but the bank refused and published an advertisement to auction it off at 3:00 PM on the 26th of this month. Our organization believes that textile factories are important industries, and since the factory's assets are worth so much and the company has agreed to pay part of the debt and all the interest, the auction should not be carried out hastily. We request you to quickly issue a telegram to stop it in order to maintain industry and protect property rights. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai Municipal Local Association, respectfully. (2) Telegram to Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan, Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance, Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry, and Chairman Chen of the Cotton Industry Control Committee in Nanjing: As our industry is in dire straits, we have repeatedly appealed in the past. The Shenxin No. 7 Factory in Shanghai is valued at over five million yuan. Previously, it was mortgaged to the British-owned HSBC for two million yuan. Unable to redeem it upon expiration, the bank is auctioning it off at a reserve price of 2.25 million yuan. This matter concerns the entire future of the cotton industry, and the public is terrified. We earnestly request you to devise a sound strategy to protect sovereignty and await your instructions with trepidation. The Chinese Cotton Mill Owners' Association, respectfully.</p>
<p>The Factory is Worth Five Million Yuan: Xin Sheng She reports that Rong Zongjing is the general manager of Shenxin Textile General Company. Its factories No. 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are all located in Shanghai, factory No. 3 is in Wuxi, and factory No. 4 is in Hankou. It is the largest textile company in China. Its No. 7 Factory is located at No. 468 Yangshupu Road, with 56,284 spindles, 134,440 thread spindles, and 449 looms, employing over 4,000 workers. The factory manager is Li Jiyao. It is currently operating day and night shifts as usual. Its total value in national currency is over five million yuan. This time, the British-owned HSBC is auctioning it off at a reserve price of 2.25 million yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Foreign Banks' Economic Aggression: Raising Deposit Interest Rates <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The Purpose is the Same as Resuming Issuance of Banknotes</p>
<p>Banking Industry and Others Express Preventive Opinions</p>
<p>Hua Dong She reports that recently, foreign banks in this city, such as HSBC, Mercantile Bank, Yokohama Specie Bank, and Bank of Taiwan, have agreed to unanimously resume the policy of issuing banknotes. HSBC was the first to implement it, and although it has only been a little over a month, the amount of banknotes circulating in the market is already several million yuan. Mercantile Bank, Bank of Taiwan, and others are also making preparations and will soon be able to issue banknotes. The purpose of their plan to resume issuing banknotes is nothing more than to absorb silver from the Chinese market and then transport it out for profit. Although the Ministry of Finance sent personnel to Shanghai to stop them, they initially refused to comply. Recently, foreign banks have decided to take further steps to absorb silver by raising the interest rates on deposits for their customers in order to attract deposits from the Chinese people. This measure has also been implemented and is a cause for concern for China's economic future. In the past, foreign banks' interest rates on deposits were extremely low, generally around one or two li. When the war in Zhejiang occurred, the Chinese people, fearing that the war would be prolonged and affect the entire domestic economy, converted their cash into deposits in foreign banks. At that time, foreign banks, due to the excessive amount of deposits, even demanded safekeeping fees. It is difficult to calculate the unexpected benefits that foreign banks gained from this abnormal phenomenon. However, since overseas silver prices have risen in recent years, foreign banks have transferred their silver reserves to Europe and America for profit, causing an unprecedented silver panic in China. The Chinese people are still trying to remedy this situation. However, foreign banks are now redoubling their efforts, using the plans to resume issuing banknotes and raise deposit interest rates to absorb China's remaining cash. The trend is likely to affect China's economic future. Although foreign banks occasionally publish inspection reports on the cash reserves for their banknotes, Chinese authorities never send personnel to participate. As for the security of customer deposits, foreign banks fundamentally refuse to join the Savings Deposit Guarantee Reserve Committee organized by the Ministry of Finance, leaving no guarantee in case of unforeseen circumstances. All Chinese people should pay close attention to the past turmoil of the Sino-French Industrial Bank. At that time, it was squeezed and ran aground. Although it was later liquidated, the impact on the Chinese people was significant. Moreover, the purpose of foreign banks resuming issuing banknotes and raising deposit interest rates is to absorb China's remaining silver. How can this be easily ignored?</p>
<p>Hua Dong She reports that since Hua Dong She reporters learned that HSBC and other banks are indeed planning and actively proceeding with the continued issuance of large amounts of banknotes, all sectors of society have paid close attention to it. This type of aggression is more harmful than any political force. It is now known that American-owned Citibank, British-owned Mercantile Bank, and Japanese-owned Bank of Taiwan are also preparing to issue banknotes in succession. (This matter has been brewing since the end of last year, more than three months ago.) Hua Dong She reporters inquired yesterday morning from various parties in the banking industry, the industrial sector, and economic scholars for preventive opinions. The unanimous response was that, in this critical period, there is no other way than for the people to absolutely trust the government. If we do not exchange our cash for their banknotes, then even if they gain some advantages in trade, it can be stopped by promoting domestic products. If the compatriots across the country recall the boycott movement against Yuan Shikai in the fifth year of the Republic, under the promotion of banking leader Song Hanzhang, the reputation of the Bank of China's banknotes rose steadily, leading to the current status of Chinese banks' banknotes. In fact, the reserve funds of various banks were less than half of what they are now. Under today's circumstances, the reserve funds of various Chinese banks are sufficient, so there is no need to worry. In particular, members of various bankers' associations are actively working for the country and the people. For example, during the general settlement, the China Land Reclamation Bank was rumored to be unable to redeem its banknotes due to sabotage by foreigners. Various banks continued to redeem banknotes as usual, even during the rest period of the general settlement. This proves that the reputation of Chinese banks is not as falsely claimed by those who try to undermine them. As for the saying that some related parties should request the authorities to sanction them, there are difficulties due to unequal treaties. It is better for the people to trust the government.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Registration of Foreign Rice Stopped Yesterday <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Rice Merchants Throughout the City Supervise Each Other</p>
<p>Da Gong She reports that last year, several provinces in China, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi, were devastated by drought, resulting in poor harvests. In order to regulate the people's food supply and make up for the shortage of domestic food, rice merchants ordered foreign rice from Saigon and registered with the Bureau of Social Affairs for statistical purposes. The total number of foreign rice bags ordered by this city and other cities has reached more than 6.3 million bags. The Shanghai Bureau of Social Affairs, fearing that excessive foreign grain imports would not only cause silver to flow out but also cause rice prices to plummet in the future, affecting rural areas, which is of great importance, specially instructed the Bean and Rice Association and the Grain Association to stop registration uniformly from yesterday for the sake of implementing restrictions.</p>
<p>Drafting Punishment Measures: After the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs implemented the suspension of registration for foreign rice purchases, fearing that rice merchants would still secretly purchase it privately, it has specially formulated punishment measures. If found, the first offense will be given a warning, the second offense will be fined, and the third offense will have a portion of the total price of the ordered foreign rice confiscated for disaster relief and price stabilization. These measures are currently being drafted and will be implemented after being submitted to the municipal government for approval.</p>
<p>Rice Merchants Supervise Each Other: The Bean and Rice Trade Association and the Grain Trade Association of this city have held several meetings to discuss the foreign rice incident and have announced that they will no longer order it to avoid economic danger for fellow merchants and to maintain rural areas. Recently, they received an order from the Bureau of Social Affairs to uniformly suspend registration from the 25th. In order to maintain the government's prestige and protect the interests of fellow merchants, rice merchants throughout the city have begun to supervise each other from yesterday. If any fellow merchant privately orders it, they will report it to the association for sanction.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Decimal Subsidiary Coins to be Made of Nickel and Antimony; Mint Has Begun Trial Casting <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Because Nickel and Antimony are Hard, Dishonest Merchants Cannot Counterfeit</p>
<p>Hundreds of Sample Coins Have Already Been Minted</p>
<p>China News Agency reports that the Ministry of Finance, noting the complexity of subsidiary coins in our country and the urgent need for unification, ordered the Currency System Research Committee to study decimal subsidiary coins and planned to use nickel and antimony for the coins. China News Agency reporters learned yesterday from the committee's Shanghai office that the nickel and antimony subsidiary coins have been started on trial casting by the Central Mint. The details are listed below:</p>
<p>Ministry of Railways Requests: In our country, the planned silver coins of single mao and double mao were originally decimal. Later, due to the proliferation of private counterfeiting in the market, the price of silver corners fell day by day, so there were fluctuations of more than twelve or thirteen corners per yuan. Recently, the Ministry of Railways also noted that the subsidiary coins in our country are complex, and the market often distinguishes between "big silver dollars" and "small silver dollars," making business slow and greatly affecting work. The same is true for industry and commerce. It specially requested the Ministry of Finance to quickly mint decimal subsidiary coins as soon as possible. The Ministry of Finance then ordered the Currency System Research Committee to plan and study in order to realize it as soon as possible. After receiving the order, the committee summoned all members to discuss it together.</p>
<p>Trial Casting of Sample Coins: As a result of the research, the majority of the committee members agreed that the reason for the indefinite rise and fall of the market prices of big and small silver dollars is due to private counterfeiting. Therefore, they advocated that decimal subsidiary coins should be made of nickel and antimony, which are harder than silver and require a machine with a pressure of 200 degrees to be cast, making it difficult for dishonest merchants to counterfeit. Moreover, countries such as England, America, Japan, and Germany also use this as currency. If it is still cast in silver, private counterfeiting will be unavoidable, affecting the decimal plan. Although this matter has not yet been approved by the Ministry of Finance, the committee has commissioned the Central Mint to cast a trial for research purposes. Hundreds of sample coins with different finenesses have been cast.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Selection of Antiquities for Shipment to England Concludes Today <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>A Total of More Than Eighty Pieces of Bronzeware, Etc. Selected</p>
<p>Two British Committee Members Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports that the London Exhibition of Chinese Art is scheduled to open this winter. After our country decided to ship rare antiquities from past dynasties to England to participate in the exhibition, the Ministry of Interior and other departments immediately sent Commissioner Fu Yiwen and others to Shanghai to select antiquities stored in Shanghai from the ancient palaces. The selection work began on the 12th of this month. Every day, Commissioner Fu, together with representatives of various institutions, carefully selects the items. According to Commissioner Fu yesterday, a total of more than 80 boxes of antiquities stored in Shanghai from the ancient palace have been selected. Currently, more than 80 pieces of antiquities have been selected, mostly bronzeware, about 60 pieces, which are all zun, yi, ding, jue, and yi from above the Three Dynasties. Other items include ten pieces of jade, four pieces of rhinoceros horn, and one piece of silverware, all of which are very precious. They are now being reviewed by Li Ji, Tang Lan, Xu Hongbao, and others participating in the art exhibition. Antiquities that are damaged or have little value will be discarded. This work is expected to be completed on the 26th. It will be subject to another review during the preview to ensure that it is serious. The opening date of the preview will be in the middle of next month.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that five members of the committee for selecting antiquities for the London Exhibition of Chinese Art have come to China. Among them, Sir Percuial David Bart and O. Raphael arrived in Shanghai yesterday and are staying at the Astor House Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road. They will join the committee for selecting antiquities for the pre-exhibition of the London Exhibition of Chinese Art in Shanghai to jointly select antiquities for shipment to England for exhibition. The association specially sent Wu Zexiang, a member of the Treaty Committee of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Wen Yuanlin, an English secretary, to visit them yesterday and scheduled a small banquet at the International Hotel this afternoon to welcome the two committee members.</p>
<h3 id="e125">After the Crash of Pacific-Guangdong Line Aircraft No. 3 <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Damaged Plane Transported to Shanghai for Repairs</p>
<p>Pilot Sent to Hankou for Medical Treatment</p>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, the Pacific-Guangdong line aircraft of Eurasia Aviation Corporation, which departed from Changsha Xinhe Airport at 8:50 AM on the 22nd, carrying mail to Guangzhou, crashed at noon in Yizhang County, 50 kilometers from Chenzhou. The pilot, Karen Bell, was injured. Regarding the details of the accident, Mr. Cha Zhenhu, the company's secretary, told a Dagong News Agency reporter yesterday that when Aircraft No. 3 was about to fly over the county at 12:00 on that day, a heavy fog suddenly appeared, blocking the mountain roads ahead and behind, making it impossible to discern the direction, resulting in a forced landing and crash, causing damage to the aircraft and injuries to the pilot.</p>
<p>Pilot Sent to Hankou: At the time of the crash, both the pilot, Karen Bell, and the radio operator, Yueyide, were on board. The pilot suffered the most severe injury to his right leg, with minor head injuries. The Hunan Provincial Highway Bureau dispatched personnel for rescue. Aircraft No. 8, which had flown from Hankou for inspection, escorted him to Hankou for medical treatment on Sunday. As for the radio operator, Yueyide, the company stated that he was not injured and is currently remaining at the crash site of Aircraft No. 3 in Yizhang County.</p>
<p>Damaged Plane Transported to Shanghai: The extent of the damage to Aircraft No. 3 is unknown, as the company authorities have not yet received a detailed report. According to the secretary, the damage is not expected to be too severe, otherwise the pilot would have been in mortal danger. This is indeed a fortunate turn of events. Craftsmen are currently being dispatched from the Hankou and Changsha branch stations to dismantle and transport it to Shanghai for repairs. The amount of the loss will be compensated by the company that insured the aircraft.</p>

<h3 id="e128">French Authorities and Russo-Asiatic Bank Liquidation Office Are Paying Attention to Illegal Transactions on the Chinese Eastern Railway <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Will Express Their Views When Japan and Russia Sign the Agreement</p>
<p>According to the New Sound News Agency, since the compromise agreement on the illegal sale and purchase of the Chinese Eastern Railway between Japan and Russia was reached, the Japanese side has already begun drafting the agreement. Therefore, the realization of the illegal transaction is not far off. It is now known that not only is our government closely monitoring its development, preparing to lodge a protest with both Japan and Russia if necessary, declaring that China will never recognize it as an accomplished fact, but also the Liquidation Office of the Russo-Asiatic Bank and the authorities in Paris are paying attention to its development, in preparation for expressing their views when the time comes. According to a related person, the Liquidation Office of the Russo-Asiatic Bank in Shanghai and the authorities in Paris have an interest in the Chinese Eastern Railway. When the negotiations for the illegal sale and purchase of the Chinese Eastern Railway between Japan and Russia began, the French Ambassador to Tokyo once stated to the Japanese side that he was reserving his rights. At the same time, the Liquidation Office of the Russo-Asiatic Bank in Shanghai also sent a letter of protest to the Russian Embassy Office on the Bund and the Japanese Minister, Arima Akiri. At that time, both the Japanese and Russian ministers replied to the bank that they had forwarded the received letter to their respective governments. Therefore, if Japan and Russia realize the sale and purchase this time, both sides will reiterate their claims. Although this kind of action will not produce any effect, it is a necessary diplomatic procedure, the purpose of which is to reserve rights for future action.</p>

<p>No Recent Progress in the Abolition of Extraterritoriality by Various Countries</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, after Tang Youren, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing on the morning of the 24th, he visited Huang Fu, Chairman of the Executive Yuan's Political Consolidation Committee in Beiping, that evening and had a conversation. Mr. Tang met with a reporter from the Central News Agency at his residence on Gansidong Road yesterday morning and made the following remarks:</p>
<p>Wang Chonghui Will Leave Japan for the United States: According to Mr. Tang, Central Committee Member Wang Chonghui's leave has expired, so he recently detoured through Japan to return directly to his post in The Hague. Mr. Wang's trip to Japan was purely a personal matter, as a Japanese man who had served with Wang as a judge on the Hague International Court of Justice had returned to Japan. As Wang had not seen him for a long time, he made a detour through Japan to meet him for a reunion. He also visited various circles in Japan in his capacity as a judge of the International Court of Justice and inspected the state of the legal community in Japan. He was not entrusted with any mission. Mr. Wang will soon leave Japan for a trip to the United States and then return directly to The Hague to resume his duties.</p>
<p>Huang Fu Will Go to Mogan Mountain Soon: Huang Fu, Chairman of the Executive Yuan's Political Consolidation Committee in Beiping, has been staying in Shanghai for medical treatment for his illness for many days. I personally visited Mr. Huang yesterday. After medical treatment, his illness has gradually improved, so his cheeks are fuller than before. He is currently receiving daily blood transfusions and will soon recover completely. Mr. Huang also plans to go to Mogan Mountain for a temporary stay within a day or two to recuperate. The date of his entry to Beijing to assume the concurrent post of Minister of the Interior will be decided after he arrives in Mogan Mountain.</p>
<p>Matters Concerning the Abolition of Extraterritoriality by Various Countries: There has been no recent progress on the issue of the abolition of consular jurisdiction in China by various countries. It was reported that the American Minister to China, Johnson, will first abolish his country's consular jurisdiction in China after returning to China, as an initiative for other countries. People in the country have expressed admiration for this, but the American Legation in China has not yet made any formal statement on this matter. I have only seen it reported in the newspapers.</p>
<p>Gu Weijun Will Return to His Post Soon: Our Minister to France, Gu Weijun, has returned to the country for half a year. Mr. Gu still has a short time to stay in the country because his private affairs have not yet been completed. He will soon return to his post. As for the signing of the Sino-Turkish Commercial Treaty, it is being carried out by Minister Hu Shize with the Turkish side. Commerce between China and Turkey has not been developed and amounts to only tens of thousands of dollars a year, so both sides are not rushing to resolve it. The newly appointed Minister to Turkey, He Yaozu, is scheduled to take a ship to Turkey on March 13 to take up his new post. Relations between China and Turkey should become closer in the future. As for Li Zeyi, a consultant to the Fujian Provincial Government, going to Japan, this is a private matter. Mr. Li often travels back and forth to Japan, Mr. Tang said, and is scheduled to return to Beijing on the evening of the 26th.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Representatives of the Marine Engineers Association Return to Shanghai from Beijing <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications Fully Accepts the Removal of Seafarers Without Certificates</p>
<p>According to an investigation by the Marine Engineers Association into the recent accidents of various merchant ships, such as the Tongfu Wheel of the Tong'an Company, the Zhaoxing Wheel of the Zhaoxing Company, and the Taishan Wheel of the Sanbei Company, all were caused by the employment of seafarers without certificates. At the time of departure, seafarers with certificates were often used as substitutes to clear customs. Whether these seafarers without certificates have passed the examination of the Ministry of Communications and whether they are qualified in driving and marine engineering is questionable. The Marine Engineers Association has raised objections to this. For example, doctors and lawyers who have not obtained a license after passing an examination cannot perform their duties. Moreover, seafarers bear the heavy responsibility of the safety of human lives at sea. The Ministry Order has strictly stipulated the examination method. Seafarers without certificates should not be allowed to fill positions indiscriminately, causing major disasters. They should be immediately replaced.</p>
<p>Petition to Beijing: For the sake of learning from past mistakes, the Marine Engineers Association publicly recommended four standing members of the association to bring a petition to the capital and submit it to the Ministry of Communications, requesting to meet with Minister Zhu Jiahua to explain in detail the danger of using unlicensed seafarers on various ships and requesting the strict implementation of the Ministry Order to replace all seafarers who have not passed the examination and been issued a certificate with seafarers with certificates in the current merchant ships. Because Minister Zhu was away on official business, Secretary-General Shi Jiyin met with the representatives and considered the opinions presented by the representatives to be a matter of urgent priority for maritime safety. The petition was received, and it was agreed to forward it to the minister for approval.</p>
<p>Satisfactory Return to Shanghai: At the Ministry, the representatives also met with Gao Tingzi, Director of the Navigation Administration Department, and stated their intentions to Director Gao. Director Gao also agreed to talk to Minister Zhu and then implement the petition method, deciding to first order various companies to replace the seafarers without certificates of Chinese nationality with those with certificates within a certain period of time. After the seafarers of Chinese nationality have been dealt with, the seafarers of foreign nationality without certificates will be dealt with further. They will also not be allowed to fill any positions on ships. The representatives believed that they had achieved good results and were very satisfied. They left Beijing yesterday and returned to Shanghai. According to the representatives, after the implementation of this matter, accidents on ships can be reduced, which is also good news for the maritime community.</p>

<p>Held Once Every Fifteen Years</p>
<p>The Finnish Consul-General in Shanghai sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: "A few weeks ago, I sent a letter to the International Trade Bureau of this city, stating that a national fair will be held in Helsinki, Finland, from October 5 to 13 this year. The fair is held once every fifteen years. In my letter to Director He of the International Trade Bureau, I explained that participating in the fair can provide insight into the state of the entire Finnish industrial world and offers many opportunities to promote international trade relations, as the leaders of the entire Finnish business and industrial world will gather in one place during the fair. Director He told me that your chamber has already received news about this matter. I believe that those who go to Helsinki to participate in the fair can also take the opportunity to visit various countries in Europe, which is a double benefit. If there is an organized group going together, our country can provide free guidance. All state-owned railways in our country can also offer discounted fares. However, this organization must be prepared early before summer, as there are many visiting groups from various countries going to Finland, and our country needs to guide them. I am willing to provide more information about this matter and hope to cooperate with your chamber at any time."</p>

<p>Wu, the captain of the Shanghai Recruitment Team of the China Aviation Association, previously appointed Director-General Li Dachao and staff members Zhang Yuliang, Xue Baolun, Zhou Songhe, Zhu Shengyang, Zhou Xinwei, Li Jimin, and Gu Shangrui to facilitate the liaison between the captains and the recruitment work. They were assigned to contact the various recruitment team leaders at any time to assist in the recruitment and fundraising process. This has been noted in various newspapers. It is now learned that the office has decided on the above plan, carefully analyzing the 400 recruitment teams according to the familiarity of each member, considering the distribution of several teams, contacting them at any time, and assisting in the recruitment and fundraising process. The activities began yesterday, and a form was stipulated for each member to report the contact process on a daily basis for easy understanding of the progress of each team.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the general captain's office specially printed employee certificates for the convenience of staff members to carry out external activities so that all sectors can easily recognize them. The certificates are signed and sealed by Director-General Li Dachao and attached with a recent two-inch photo of each employee to prevent imposters from impersonating them.</p>

<p>Limited to Reporting Sea Routes and Astronomical Climate</p>
<p>Private Telegrams Are Not Allowed to Be Sent or Received</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's radio stations were ordered by the Ministry of Communications last winter, for the sake of unifying telecommunications, to transfer the Shanghai headquarters and the Nanjing branch to the Ministry of Communications. The call signs for sending and receiving telegrams at the two stations were also changed to XON for the Shanghai headquarters and XOO for the Nanjing branch, as ordered. The station was also ordered to submit the staff roster and all public property to the Ministry for takeover. After receiving the instructions, the company stated that its ships had a large number of telegrams directly with various seagoing vessels every day, and there were also many exchanges with coastal stations. The Nanjing station specialized in handling the reports of various ships on the Yangtze River, which was already overwhelming. In fact, it was difficult to change to management by the Ministry. The company especially explained the importance of telegram exchanges between the river and sea vessels and requested the Ministry to exempt the change to management by the Ministry in order to facilitate maritime transport and communication. The Ministry of Communications has now issued instructions that the two radio stations in Beijing and Shanghai are exempt from being taken over by the Ministry and will still be directly managed by the company. However, the call signs have been corrected as above. In the future, the two radio stations are only allowed to send and receive telegrams for the company's own ships, reporting ship routes and astronomical climate. Other private telegrams are not allowed to be sent or received.</p>

<p>Workers Petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>The Cotton Industry Denies Seeking Instructions from Soong Tse-vung</p>
<p>According to the East China News Agency, the cotton industry is in a severe depression. The Shanghai Second Cotton Mill of the Shenxin Textile Company at No. 2 Yichang Road has also formally announced its shutdown. The mill was founded in the 33rd year of the Guangxu reign and reorganized and taken over by industrialist Rong Zongjing in January of the 7th year of the Republic of China, with a capital of 2.5 million taels. Rong was the manager, and Zhu Xianfang and Rong Puren were the factory directors. Zhang Fangzu was the chief engineer. There were 56,744 yarn spindles and 7,140 thread spindles, with more than 2,300 workers. It was originally scheduled to start production on February 6, but due to practical difficulties, it was postponed to the 19th and production was not started. The factory has now formally announced that workers should collect their wages. The workers feel the difficulty of this situation and convened a temporary emergency meeting at Yinxueli, Caojiadu, yesterday, deciding to organize a petitioning group and requesting the Municipal Party Department, the Social Affairs Bureau, and other relevant authorities to find ways to provide relief. It has now been decided that representatives Li Jilin, Wang Zhuping, and others, totaling about fifty people, will go to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition yesterday afternoon. As for the report that the cotton industry will visit Soong Tse-vung for instructions, it is absolutely untrue.</p>

<h3 id="e139">Employer Refuses to Pay Wet Nurse's Wages, Wants to Sell Child as Compensation <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Wet Nurse Sues in Court, Cries Bitterly on Stand</p>
<p>After Adjournment, Child Snatched Away by Employer Again</p>
<p>Zhang Liu, a woman from Yixing, is 31 years old. Her husband, Zhang Wanrong, has been working as a kiln worker in Nanjing. Because the family was poor and unable to make a living, Ms. Zhang came to Shanghai two years ago in November to find work. Through the introduction of her fellow villager, Tan Cai, on the third day of that month, she was recommended to the home of Zhang Qingyuan, a native of Nanxiang and owner of the Xinbao Kang and Xinbao Sheng soy sauce shops in the French Concession on Route Camille Guérin. Zhang Qingyuan, 50 years old, is quite wealthy. He has one wife and four concubines. The wife lives in Nanxiang, her hometown, managing household affairs. She has two daughters, the elder named Shengbao, 16 years old, who is already married, and the younger named Axiao, 14 years old, who studies in the countryside and helps her mother with chores. Zhang's senior concubine, Ms. Chen, is 37 years old, a local, and lives with Zhang Qingyuan in the shop. She has five daughters, two of whom have died young. There are currently three daughters, the eldest named Xianzhen, 7 years old, the second named Laipi, 5 years old, and the youngest named Xiao A'wu, who is nursed by the wet nurse Zhang Liu. When Ms. Liu started working, both parties agreed that the monthly salary would be ten yuan. Around March of last year, Ms. Liu suddenly received a letter from her husband, Zhang Wanrong, saying that he was seriously ill and asked her to go to Nanjing to take care of him. After receiving the letter, Ms. Liu asked her employer for leave to go to Nanjing. At that time, Zhang Qingyuan replied to Ms. Liu, "You can take the child with you to raise, and I will increase your salary by five yuan per month. I will send your salary to the post office every month," and so on. Since Ms. Liu had gained the trust of her employer, she gladly took the child to Nanjing to visit her husband. Unexpectedly, Ms. Liu did not receive her salary from her employer for two months after arriving in Nanjing. She sent letters urging payment, but there was no reply. Moreover, her husband's illness was lingering, and she could not leave for a while. It was not until the middle of last month that Ms. Liu took the child back to Shanghai to ask her employer, Zhang Qingyuan, for eleven months' salary, totaling one hundred and sixty-five yuan. To her surprise, Zhang Qingyuan refused to let Ms. Liu enter the door and did not mention the salary. Instead, he said to Ms. Liu, "There are too many children in my family. You might as well sell the child to compensate for your salary," and so on, treating her unreasonably in various ways. Ms. Liu, in this situation, was unfamiliar with Shanghai and had no place to live or food to eat. She then turned to others to draft a complaint and submit it to the Civil Court of the Second Special District, requesting that Zhang Qingyuan be summoned to the court for mediation and ordered to pay the owed salary. The court summoned the parties based on the complaint. Ms. Liu came to the court holding the child. To her surprise, the defendant, Zhang Qingyuan, denied that the girl Xiao A'wu was his daughter, and mediation could not be established. Now, Zhang Liu has again asked someone to draft a complaint and submit it to the Criminal Court of the Second Special District, accusing Zhang Qingyuan of abandoning his daughter, Xiao A'wu, requesting that he be investigated according to law, and attaching a civil lawsuit to seek the owed salary. The court approved the complaint. Yesterday morning, Judge Qiu Huan-ying summoned the parties in the second courtroom. First, the plaintiff, Zhang Liu, stated the details of the case. The defendant, Zhang Qingyuan, stated in his defense that the salary had been paid in full and was not in arrears. The witness, Tan Cai (the original introducer of Zhang Liu), testified in the same way as Ms. Liu. The judge then said to the defendant, "The plaintiff is a poor woman. She abandoned her own child to work as a wet nurse. This kind of blood money should be repaid according to conscience." He also instructed that the debate be concluded and that the sentence be pronounced on the 28th. Ms. Liu cried loudly upon hearing the instruction and refused to leave, claiming that she had no food or shelter in Shanghai and demanded a quick solution. She was then persuaded to leave by the bailiff, holding the child, and lingered in front of the court. Zhang Qingyuan and his concubine forcibly snatched the child from Ms. Liu's arms. Ms. Liu was alone and unable to resist, and could only watch them leave with the child.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Heavy Fog in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Since the beginning of spring, the weather in Shanghai has been unpredictable, with frequent changes in temperature. This has been especially true in recent days. During the day, the temperature on the Fahrenheit thermometer rises to between 50 and 60 degrees, and pedestrians on the road change into lighter clothing or wear camel hair. However, it is colder in the evening, only about 30 degrees. Therefore, those who are not careful when sleeping at night may suffer from colds. The day before yesterday (Sunday), the weather was sunny for a day, with a gentle breeze, reminiscent of the atmosphere of spring. Unexpectedly, by the evening, the northeast wind suddenly became fierce and strong, and the sky was covered with haze and fog. By about 3 a.m. yesterday morning, it was followed by light rain. The whole day was drizzly, and the heavy fog did not dissipate slightly. Moreover, the humidity in the room was abnormally high, quite similar to the weather during the plum rain season.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Rice and Rice Prices Rise in the City <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Citizens' Living Standards Are Rising Again</p>
<p>According to the China News Agency, the National Tariff Commission announced yesterday that the cost of living index for the city last month (January) was higher than last year. The average index has been rising since March of last year. At a time when the social economy is depressed, citizens are feeling the pain. The following is a summary of the cost of living situation last month:</p>
<p>Cost of Living Index: The total cost of living index for the city last month was 110.4, an increase of 0.5 percent, which is an increase of 8.9 percent compared to 101.8 in the same month last year. Compared with the previous month, the clothing, food, housing, fuel, and miscellaneous categories of the index showed mixed increases and decreases, except for rent, which remained unchanged. The food category index was 90.8, an increase of 0.4 percent compared to 90.4 in the previous month. The reason for this is that rice prices have risen, and soybean oil prices have also risen with wholesale sales. The vegetable fuel index was 128.0, a sharp increase of 12.6 percent compared to 113.7 in the previous month. However, fine cloth, flower labels, and cotton thread in the clothing category all tended to be sluggish.</p>
<p>Rising for Months: It has been found that the total cost of living index for citizens in this city has been rising for months in the last eleven months. The total cost of living index in March of last year was 98.9, which rose to 99.0 in April. In May and June, it once fell back to 98.5, but in July, the total index was 106.9, an increase of 8.4 compared to May and June. The total index in August was 115.7, in September it was 118.1, in October it was 113.3, in November it was 108.8, in December it was 110.4, and in January of this year it was 111.0. Compared with May and June of last year, the total index increased by 3.5, which is really related to the livelihood of citizens.</p>

<p>A Room on the Second Floor</p>
<p>Opened for Less Than Three Hours</p>
<p>At 9:10 p.m. last night, a fire broke out on the second floor of the Xingxiang Genji Inn (a small single-bay three-story inn) at No. 7 Route Duchaillard in the French Concession. A patrolman who saw it immediately reported it to the Avenue Joffre Fire Brigade, which rushed to the rescue. Although the fire was quickly extinguished, two female and one male guest in the same room on the third floor had been burned to death. The police station immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. On the one hand, they notified the Tongren Fuyuan Sub-Hall and ordered the hall staff to transport the three bodies to the mortuary to await inspection by the Second Special District Court. On the other hand, they took the two tea servants of the inn into the police station to investigate the cause of the fire. It was later learned that the three people who were burned to death had just gone to open the room at about 6 p.m. yesterday. Unexpectedly, they suffered such a disaster in less than three hours. It is indeed tragic.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Old Woman from Yangzhou Sues Qiu Changsheng to Confirm He Is Her Biological Son <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Qiu Doesn't Know Who Gave Birth to Me</p>
<p>But It Is Difficult to Acknowledge the Old Woman</p>
<p>Qiu Changsheng, the adopted son of the late paint tycoon Qiu Weiqing, was recently sued by Jiang Jiang, an old woman from Yangzhou, through lawyer Chen Daxun to the First Special District Court, requesting confirmation that Qiu Changsheng is her biological son and ordering him to return to his ancestral home. This case has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Peng Shi of the First Special Court continued the trial in the 14th Civil Court. Qiu Changsheng also came to the court with lawyer Tao Jiachun. According to Jiang Jiang, she is 66 years old and has had three sons. The eldest and youngest sons have died many years ago. Qiu Changsheng is her second son, born in the 30th year of Guangxu. The following year, he was introduced by the village elder Xu Zhen and fostered in the Qiu family. Now that my husband is deceased and no one is raising me, I want Qiu to return to his ancestral home. In the 21st year of the Republic, I came to Shanghai, and the defendant gave me 2,000 yuan, and so on. The defendant's lawyer then presented two pieces of evidence: (1) the license for Qiu Changsheng's adoption; (2) the receipt for 20 yuan received by Jiang Jiang in the 21st year of the Republic, stating the words "falsely claiming to be a parent and not allowed to make trouble again." The court then summoned Qiu Changsheng to the court. According to his statement, he is 32 years old, a native of Yangzhou, and lives at No. 184 Tongfu Road. He could not acknowledge the plaintiff's accusation, saying that he was adopted by the Qiu family when he was in swaddling clothes. Who gave birth to me is unknown. He had never seen the plaintiff in person. There was no contact even for family celebrations and funerals. It was difficult to acknowledge the plaintiff's claim that he was her biological son, and he presented a gift book to prove that there had been no contact. The court then summoned lawyer Wang Siji to prove that the signature on the receipt for the plaintiff's receipt of money was his signature. Judge Peng then asked the plaintiff if there were any marks on her child's body that could prove it. She replied that he was only one week old when he was fostered in the Qiu family, and she did not know if there were any marks. Judge Peng then advised the defendant to reconcile without success, and then ordered the debate to begin, and then announced the end of the debate, and scheduled the judgment to be announced on the afternoon of the 27th.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Shanghai Telephone Bureau to Use Automatic Machines in the City Center <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications originally planned to replace the new machines in Minhang at the end of this month or the beginning of next month, but it was delayed because the machines have not all been shipped to Shanghai. According to the person in charge of the bureau, there are more than a dozen old-fashioned manual machines in Minhang. The bureau originally planned to dismantle more than 100 telephone machines in Jiangwan and transport them to Minhang for installation. However, the new machines in Jiangwan have not all been transported, so they could not be dismantled as scheduled. It is estimated that they can all be transported in about May. After they are transported, they can be dismantled and installed separately. The Jiangwan District Branch will be abolished, and a branch will be established in the city center, and all telephones in the city center will be replaced with automatic machines. As for the original telephone numbers, they will also be changed to distinguish them from the Zhabei Branch. Pudong is also currently using manual machines. In the future, as the telephone service expands, it is also planned to use automatic machines to facilitate users.</p>

<p>—Shen Ruihua's Absurdity, the Judge Reprimands Severely—</p>
<p>Cheng Cai Gendi, a local young woman, is 21 years old, beautiful, and lost her parents when she was young. She relies on her stepmother, Wang, for a living. In the 22nd year of the Republic, she was married by a matchmaker to Cheng Xuecui (24 years old), a local man who runs the Cheng Juxing redwood dowry shop in Dong Yaojia Lane, Xiaodongmen, Nanshi. At the beginning of their marriage, the couple's feelings were still harmonious. The following year, they often quarreled over trivial family matters. Since then, the relationship between husband and wife has gradually faded, even to the point of being like strangers. Seeing this situation, Cai Gendi thought that she had met the wrong person and suddenly had thoughts of giving up on life. In December of last year,</p>
<p>She Attempted Suicide by Smoking Opium. Cheng Xuecui discovered it and immediately sent her to Nanyang Hospital for treatment. Later, Cheng's brother-in-law, Shen Ruihua, and others came forward to mediate. They opened a room in the Yuebin Hotel and invited Cai Gendi to come and comfort her, resulting in the writing of a divorce agreement. Cai Gendi believed that she had been fooled and hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the local court, requesting that the divorce agreement be declared invalid and requesting separate residence and a one-time payment of 3,900 yuan for living expenses, and so on. The defendant, Cheng Xuecui, also hired a lawyer to file a defense. After the court received the complaint, Judge Han Zuoti specially opened the Sixth Court at 2 p.m. yesterday to summon the parties. Both parties came to the court with their lawyers. First, the plaintiff,</p>
<p>Cheng Cai Gendi, stated that she is 21 years old. At the age of 19, she was married by a matchmaker to the defendant, Cheng Xuecui. After the marriage, the couple's relationship was very good in the first year. They had a daughter. In the summer of the second year, the defendant had a new love affair outside, abandoning the plaintiff unwillingly. He often stayed outside and picked quarrels at home for no reason, often resorting to violence. The plaintiff is an old-fashioned woman who only knows to follow her husband, whether he is a chicken or a dog. She has the principle of following one person to the end. Although she has been abused by the defendant in every possible way, she can only patiently endure it, waiting for the defendant to change his mind in the future,</p>
<p>To Reconcile as Husband and Wife. Unexpectedly, the defendant saw my concession and became more and more outrageous. Seeing this situation, I thought that my life was miserable and that I had no缘 with the defendant. Recalling that my parents had both died and that I was in such a bad environment, it would be better to die. So, in December of last year, I attempted suicide by taking opium. Unexpectedly, my family discovered it and sent me to Nanyang Hospital for treatment. After I recovered, Shen Ruihua, the defendant's brother-in-law, and others opened a room in the Yuebin Hotel to comfort me. How could I know that they had conspired in advance and asked Shen Ruihua and others to hold a blank piece of paper and ask me to put my thumbprint on it, pretending that it was a certificate from the hospital. At that time, I was too deeply poisoned,</p>
<p>My Mind Was Confused. It was not until the next day that I woke up and immediately argued with the defendant and others to no avail. The defendant and others' illegal behavior clearly showed that they had been planning to abandon me for a long time. I am a weak woman with no ability to support myself. I have no food, clothing, or shelter in the future. I have no choice but to ask the judge to order the forced marriage certificate to be declared invalid, and to ask the child to be raised by the Cheng family, to rent a house separately, and to pay a one-time payment of 3,900 yuan for living expenses, and so on. After the statement was completed, tears streamed down her face, and she cried inconsolably. Then, the defendant, Cheng Xuecui, stated that he is 24 years old. Regarding the plaintiff's statement,</p>
<p>He Denied It Flatly and said that the plaintiff had suffered from venereal sores and did not observe the way of women. I discovered it and advised her because it was a matter of face. She knew the reason and personally put her thumbprint on it, willing to divorce. The judge asked, "Has your wife studied?" He replied, "No." Cheng Cai Gendi interjected and said, "You say that I have not studied is obviously a lie." The judge did not believe it. I might as well write numbers in court. The judge agreed, so Cai Gendi wrote, "Cheng Cai Gendi, 21 years old, has suffered this injustice. Please, Judge, redress it," and so on. After reading it, the judge repeatedly admonished both parties to reconcile. However, Shen Ruihua in the audience</p>
<p>Shook His Head as a Signal, ordering him to oppose the reconciliation. Unexpectedly, this was seen by Judge Han, who was greatly angered. He immediately ordered the bailiff to bring Shen Ruihua to the court to be admonished. He said, "The courtroom should be orderly. You have violated the legal rules and should be handed over to the prosecutor's office for warning. Considering that you are young and ignorant, I will leniently waive the investigation. The content of this case is of great importance to you. You should quickly persuade them outside to reconcile as before. If the reconciliation fails, it will be very unfavorable to you." Shen Ruihua listened to the admonition and said yes repeatedly. At this point, the judge instructed, "This case will be re-examined and decided."</p>

<h3 id="e151">Tailors' Guild Petitions Social Affairs Bureau for Verification of New Standard Soft Rulers <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>To Facilitate Their Distribution to Members</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau is sparing no effort in promoting the new system of weights and measures, and has repeatedly conducted inspections in conjunction with the Public Security Bureau. During these inspections, it was found that Western-style tailors on Zhonghua Road, such as Fuloo Company, Zhonghua Tailor, and Guohua Tailor, were using old-system soft rulers, which were ordered to be discontinued and replaced with the municipal chi. After receiving the order, the tailors explained that they had always relied on soft rulers for tailoring Western-style clothing. Although the new system of weights and measures had been implemented for years, there were no soft rulers available for sale on the market. They had been forced to continue using the old soft rulers because Western-style clothing must be tailored according to body measurements, and rigid bamboo or wooden rulers were unsuitable for the task. Now that they had received the bureau's notification, they should immediately rectify the situation. Therefore, they reported to the Tailors' Guild, which prepared a document petitioning the Social Affairs Bureau to request the Weights and Measures Bureau to promptly issue new standard soft rulers so that they could comply with regulations and benefit their business. The Social Affairs Bureau issued a response on document number 461, stating that, following the precedent set by the bean and rice industry and the rice wine industry, the guild should manufacture a large batch of new standard soft rulers and submit them to the Municipal Weights and Measures Verification Office for certification. After certification, the guild should distribute the rulers to its members to facilitate the implementation of the new system and ensure uniformity. The request for referral was deemed unnecessary. After receiving the approval, the Tailors' Guild, noting that it was the warm spring season and there was a surge in demand for spring clothing, realized that it would be extremely difficult to operate without soft rulers. Therefore, it immediately rushed to produce dozens of new standard soft rulers. After review by the executive committee and confirmation of their accuracy, a formal request is being drafted and will be submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau along with the new rulers in the next day or two for referral to the Verification Office for certification.</p>

<h3 id="e154">Three New Titles in the Ancient Coin Series <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Ding Fu-bao, noting the increasing number of scholars studying ancient coins, has specially published the Ancient Coin Series, selecting famous works and rubbings of previous scholars to be printed first for the reference of scholars. In addition to the previously published facsimile editions of Lü Yao Xian's Xiao Jian Four Zhu coin and Chen Shou Qing's Six Coins and Ten Cloths rubbings, there are now three new titles: (1) Facsimile edition of Zhang Shuwei's Ancient Coin Rubbings, one volume, containing many fine examples of ancient coins, all of which are difficult to obtain in modern times. Each item has Zhang's postscript, making it even more valuable. The end of the volume includes many coin molds, which are especially rare. Price: two yuan per copy. (2) Facsimile edition of Bao Zinian's Guan Gu Ge Coin Treatise. Duke Pan Wenqin said: "Mr. Zinian has the richest collection of coins, playing with them for more than forty years, so he is extremely discerning in distinguishing the origins, changes, authenticity, beauty, and ugliness. No one in the world can compare to him." His coin treatise, in two volumes, contains anecdotes and events that are sufficient for later generations to study and revise, and is not a superficial discussion of ancient times. It can be compared with Dai Wenjie's Ancient Coin Conghua and Liu Fangbo's On Coins Quatrains to form a triumvirate. Also, twenty-four items from Guan Gu Ge's Continued Collection of Manuscripts, including miscellaneous topics on coin albums, pseudo-coin albums, and mold albums, and forty-two items from the third series of manuscripts, including miscellaneous topics on coin albums, are all insights from ancient coin experts and are also published after the coin treatise. At the end is Li Zhupeng's Guan Gu Ge Continued Coin Treatise, one volume, which has precise arguments and is comparable to Bao's original work, worthy of being called a pair of luminaries of their time. Price: two yuan per copy. (3) Cai Yun's Odd Talks, six volumes. Yun was a close disciple of Mr. Qian Zhuting. This book discusses ancient coins in the most elaborate and comprehensive way. Because he was immersed in history and classics, he made extensive references, and his writing style is both elegant and informative, and his arguments are often unique. Bao Zinian once praised him as having obtained insights into archaeology, which is certainly not an exaggeration. The end includes Zhu Kebao's postscript, which also has considerable insights on knives, cloths, and ancient characters. Price: two yuan per copy. All books are sold by the Medical Bookstore at 204 Mei Bai Ge Road.</p>

At around 6:00 PM the night before last, while patrolling Aiduya Road, they apprehended Yu Yangguang (29 years old, from Qingpu) and Zhao Linsheng (30 years old, from Pudong). After taking them to the police station, they confessed that the guns were hidden in a house in Yiyunfang, Xilu, in the city's police department jurisdiction. The Municipal Public Security Bureau's Detective Team was immediately notified and rushed to the address with detectives, seizing one real gun and one fake gun, as well as five bullets. They were brought back to the police station. After further interrogation, they confessed that their accomplices were hiding in Room 11 of the Huitong Inn on Guangxi Road in the Public Concession. Additional officers were dispatched to surround and guard the Huitong Inn the night before last at around 9:00 PM in coordination with the Old Gate Police Station. Chinese and foreign officers wore bulletproof vests and disguised themselves as waiters and travelers.

<p>The Miscellaneous Grains and Oilseed Cake Association issued an announcement to all members yesterday, stating that in view of the drought in Zhejiang last year and the potential food shortage, Shanghai rice urgently needs to be supplied. However, due to the lack of Shanghai-Hangzhou vehicles, transportation is difficult, and more than 200 rice boats at Maigen Station and Rihui Port are waiting to be loaded, making it impossible to transport the rice. The food merchants and financiers of Zhejiang Province are suffering a great impact. The association telegraphed the Ministry of Railways on the Xiri to quickly allocate vehicles to Shanghai to facilitate rice transportation. After the telegram was sent, a reply was received from Ma Ri, stating that, except for the telegraphed instructions to the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus to quickly allocate vehicles for transportation, all members should be notified. Therefore, the telegram is urgently recorded and published for the information of all members.</p>

<p>All 720+ workers from the various departments of the China General Edison Company, due to a previous labor dispute that has not been resolved, gathered at the company around 10:00 AM yesterday, with 445 workers signing their names jointly, requesting General Manager Lu to directly distribute the original workers' housing subsidies and bonuses, without having to go through the union. After the Chief of the Ximen Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Li, learned of this, he personally led officers to the company to suppress the situation. Around 4:00 PM, the workers nominated four representatives, including Tong Guangrong and Zhu Hanzhu, to meet with Lu Bohong, along with Chief Li. The workers demanded five months of housing subsidies (only a few yuan per person per month). General Manager Lu stated that the January housing subsidies had already been borrowed by the union for 500 yuan, and the February subsidies could be borrowed as well. However, starting from March, they would be directly distributed. As for the bonus issue (which was a large sum), a decision would have to be made after the company's board of directors meeting. Representatives Lu Jingshi from the Municipal Party Headquarters and Wang Bin from the Social Affairs Bureau then mediated, and after discussing with Lu Bohong, it was agreed that future bonuses and housing subsidies would be distributed directly to the workers by the company in conjunction with the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau to avoid disputes. The issue was resolved around 7:00 PM.</p>

<p>French Police Department Notifies All Police Stations to Pay Attention</p>
<p>Within the French Concession, poor residents who encounter the death of a child, after collecting the body, often abandon it in secluded places or by the roadside because they have no place to bury it. After the street police find it, they report it to the police station, which notifies Tongren Fuyuan Fentang to send workers to collect it and transport it to the Pudong Yizhong for burial. This has been going on for years. Recently, the French Police Department, in view of the frequent discovery of abandoned small coffins in secluded places on various roads, and to prevent future disputes, instructed all police stations to transport all abandoned small coffins to the coroner's office and report them to the court for inspection, starting from the day before yesterday. At around 10:00 AM on the 23rd of this month, a small coffin of three chi was found abandoned at the foot of the wall of the Siming Guild Hall on Minguo Road. Chinese police officer No. 50 discovered it, reported it to the Mailan Police Station, and dispatched a detective to send the coffin to the Tongren Fuyuan Fentang coroner's office. Yesterday morning, the Second Special Court was notified, and Judge Wang Ren, accompanied by the forensic doctor and court clerk, arrived at the office at noon. The undertaker opened the coffin lid, revealing a male child's body with its face covered in soot. The body was taken out and, after the forensic doctor's examination, it was determined that the child had died of illness. The judge ordered the body to be photographed and buried by Tongren Fuyuan Fentang.</p>

One robber held an axe, and another pulled out a gun with no bullets, threatening the owner and employees to remain silent. More than 20 yuan in cash was robbed from the counter. As they were leaving, the robber with the gun struck the employee Zhuang Lenglu on the head with the gun butt before escaping. However, after running only a few steps, Chinese police officer No. 706, who was on guard nearby, heard the alarm and rushed to the scene, arresting the robber with the gun on the spot. The others escaped without a trace. He was taken to the police station. After a preliminary interrogation by the police chief, he was ordered to be detained and sent to the court this morning for punishment.</p>

<p>Fines Imposed Separately</p>
<p>Wu Shimei, an old man from Ningbo, had a son named Zuoyao, who worked on a foreign ship. In February of the previous year, his fellow villagers Chen Meilong and the woman Wang Rongshi acted as matchmakers and arranged for a Miss Wang to marry him. The betrothal gifts and jewelry totaled 86 yuan. However, his son committed a crime in April and was sentenced to seven years in prison. Recently, the woman's parents instructed the matchmaker Chen Meilong to urge Wu to proceed with the marriage, but he made excuses and delayed. Later, after the other party discovered the underlying reason, they promised the woman to someone else. Wu wanted to reclaim the betrothal gifts but was unsuccessful. He became angry with the female matchmaker and, from the afternoon of the 18th to around 2:00 AM the next morning, tricked Chen Meilong into being imprisoned in Room 23 of the Hongkou Hotel. He then instructed his fellow villagers Chen Hongyan and Yan Agen, along with the male matchmaker Wang Rongshi, to threaten him to repay double the betrothal gifts, 160 yuan.

<p>Pan Guanyun Sentenced to One Year Imprisonment</p>
<p>Pan Guanyun, a local man, 24 years old, residing at 84 Yad Road, worked as a street vendor and was known for his violent temper. He usually associated with vagrants and was prone to fighting. Wang Caixing, a Ningbo native who lived in the Rixin Lane of Dongxihuade Road nearby, scolded Pan's cohabitating neighbor's child, which Pan found out about. At around 10:00 PM on the 14th of this month, he gathered more than ten people and went to Wang Caixing to cause trouble. Wang, seeing the aggressive situation, did not dare to resist and asked his fellow villager Wang Wenxiang to mediate. They disagreed and Pan pulled out a knife, chopping Wang Wenxiang's head in two places, causing him to fall to the ground and call for help. Chinese detective Xu Shutian heard the alarm and arrived with street police, but the group dispersed. The injured man was sent to Tongren Hospital. Xu shutian later apprehended Pan and took him to the Huishan Police Station, from which he was sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday, Judge Jiang Shuzi presided over the third criminal court for investigation. Lawyer Li Zhishan from the Public Works Department stated that the injured Wang Wenxiang had recovered slightly and was present in court to testify, while the defendant pleaded for leniency. According to Wang Wenxiang's testimony, "I was trying to persuade the defendant to be peaceful, but I didn't expect him to be so vicious. Although my head has recovered slightly, I still feel pain." According to Yue Ren Lujun Ting, "I witnessed the defendant chopping Wang Wenxiang to the ground with a knife. I was scared and ran away." Questioned about this, the defendant's testimony was evasive. Judge Jiang sentenced Pan Guanyun to one year in prison. The number of days of detention before the verdict will be used to offset the sentence at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment.</p>

<p>He Biyun, a maidservant at the Chen Mansion at 214 Shigao Tower Road, is currently 17 years old. Around September 27 of last year, Yang Yulin (25 years old, from Yangzhou), who used to work as a tea server at the Yong'an Company rooftop amusement park, colluded with the mansion's maid Xiuying to entice her out. They first had illicit relations at the Sihaijia Hotel on Tianjin Road, and then rented a small house on the Ximen Xieqiao Road and lived together like a married couple for about two weeks. Later, because Yang fell ill and ran out of money, his friend Chen Jilin (Xiuying's husband) sent her to the Rui Xiang Yuan Mao San Tangzi in Aiduya Road Dongxin Bridge to work as a prostitute. Because business was slow, the madam of the brothel Chen Guibao transferred her to a Suzhou woman Li Zhangshi at No. 3, Tongchunfang, Zhejiang Road, where she went to the Yong'an and Sincere amusement parks every night to solicit customers, leading the life of a goddess of the stage. This was investigated by the Chinese and foreign detectives of the Disuiwei Road Police Station, who arrested Yang Yulin, Li Zhangshi, and the suspect Wang Yongji from Pudong, and sent them to the First Special District Court for interrogation of the details, which has already been reported in this newspaper. He was sent to the Jiliang Institute for care. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi came to the third criminal court and questioned the defendants. Their statements were the same as in the previous court hearing, so he ordered them to be remanded separately and set a date for sentencing.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Inspection of Small Worker Crushed to Death by Elevator <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Judge Instructs Xiangtai Foreign Firm to Provide Generous Compensation</p>
<p>Cao Shengkun, a 29-year-old small worker from Tongzhou at No. 121 Beijing Road, Xiangtai Foreign Firm, and Han Jinchang were dispatched to Yuanfang Foreign Firm at No. 126, Section 1, Sichuan Road at around 9:00 AM on the 23rd of this month to repair the elevator that was used to transport goods. Unexpectedly, while they were working, the elevator suddenly rose sharply, unable to be stopped, causing Cao to be crushed to death on the spot. Han escaped quickly and narrowly avoided disaster. The General Patrol Police Station was notified and ordered an investigation. The situation of Cao's body being taken to the Feilun Road Coroner's Office for inspection has already been reported in the previous Japanese newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Guo Wei, appointed by the First Special District Local Court, accompanied by forensic doctors Wei and Zhang, and clerk Wang Zuyi, arrived at the office to inspect the body. According to the briefing from the Western Police Chief, and the statement from Han Jinchang, 37 years old, from Ningbo, residing at No. 67, Lujiazai, Pudong, working as a small worker at Xiangtai Foreign Firm, the deceased was his subordinate, and on that day they were dispatched to Yuanfang Foreign Firm to repair the elevator. Unexpectedly, while they were both working on top of the elevator, the elevator suddenly rose straight up. Seeing that things were not good, he immediately escaped from the gap, but the deceased was unable to and was crushed to death. At that time, the repairs had been completed, and the elevator had been tested twice and was working well. When the accident occurred, he immediately ordered the driver to reverse the car, but the driver suddenly escaped to the fourth floor, causing the disaster. According to Song Renlong, who had been driving the elevator for four years at Yuanfang Foreign Firm, he was following their instructions while they were repairing the machine. Later, when he drove to the fourth floor, the brakes suddenly failed, and green electricity shot out. Knowing that it was a short circuit, he escaped. According to the Englishman Coke, an engineer at Xiangtai Foreign Firm, he went to the site yesterday morning to test the elevator and found that there was no damage, but there may have been a short circuit at the time, and the driver was unable to prevent it, because there were two wires on the elevator, one for ascending and one for descending. If the ascending wire short-circuited, the machine would go straight up, and if the descending wire short-circuited, the machine would go straight down. According to the statement from the deceased's wife, Cao Gao, Guo Yu ordered the examination to find that the deceased Cao Shengkun, male, was indeed crushed to death by the elevator. The body was handed over to his wife Cao Gao, who signed and took it back for burial. The Xiangtai Foreign Firm was instructed to provide generous compensation to the deceased's family.</p>

<p>Bandits Abandoned the Girl and Fled</p>
<p>Handled by the Water Patrol Team</p>
<p>Zhang Zhilin, a resident of Wujiabao, Taizhou, is seventy years old. His son is named Daguang, and his grandson's milk name is Sanxiaoer, who is now nine years old. On November 24th of the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), Zhang Zhilin's home was robbed by many bandits. During the robbery, his son Zhang Daguang resisted and was stabbed to death by the bandits. At the same time, Zhang Zhilin's grandson was kidnapped and taken away with the stolen goods, disappearing without a trace. The victim immediately reported the tragic situation to the Taizhou County Government, which ordered the arrest of the fleeing criminals. Subsequently, the county's anti-smuggling camp arrested three suspects involved in the robbery, Niu Shoupeng, Zhang Wenfeng, and Zhang Xueren. They were interrogated and found guilty, and sentenced to imprisonment. However, the kidnapped child remained missing and has not been rescued. It is now learned that Zhang Zhilin's cousin, Zhang Chunlin, through his friend Zhang Xuetang, learned that the perpetrator Zhou Changchun, along with his wife, daughter, and the young kidnapping victim, were hiding in a shack near the garbage beach in Pudong. Zhang Zhilin was immediately notified and traveled to Shanghai from his hometown by boat on the 17th day of the first month of the lunar calendar this year. He met with Zhang Xuetang and Zhang Chunlin to confirm the bandit's den and planned to report to the authorities for their arrest. Unexpectedly, Zhou Changchun learned of the leak and abandoned the kidnapping victim Sanxiaoer and his thirteen-year-old daughter Baozhen, taking the opportunity to flee without a trace. Thereupon, Zhang Zhilin's cousins Zhang Zhonglin and Zhang Chunlin, and Zhang Zhilin, went to the bandit's den again yesterday morning around eleven o'clock to monitor the young kidnapping victim and the girl Zhou Guizhen. They were spotted by the police on duty there, who stepped forward to question them. Upon learning the details of Zhang Zhilin's case, the police officer took the plaintiff Zhang Zhilin, Zhang Zhonglin, Zhang Chunlin, the kidnapped nine-year-old boy, and the thirteen-year-old daughter of the bandit, five people in total, to the team. After Zhang Zhihui, a patrol officer of the Third Division, interrogated the case, he prepared a document and sent them to the General Team for handling.</p>

<p>Cause: Soliciting Petty Bribes</p>
<p>Reported by Scavengers</p>
<p>The other night at Tanjia Bridge in Zhabei, a beat officer placed his gun and belt on the side of the bridge and jumped into the river. At that time, nearby boatmen heard the commotion and rescued him. Upon inquiry, it was learned that the officer's name was Gao Zhifang, a graduate of the police training school, who was assigned to serve at the Tanjia Bridge police substation of the Xinzha Branch Bureau. Recently, scavengers Huang Xiaolin, Tang Caiming, Tang Xiuming, Chen Laosan, Yu Taotao, Huang Minggen, Liu Mingsheng, Lu Maolang, and others filed a complaint with the Xinzha Branch Bureau, accusing the officer of forcibly soliciting petty bribes, which angered him and led him to jump into the river. After the incident, boatmen transported Officer Gao to the Tanjia Bridge police station, who transferred him to the Xinzha Branch Bureau. The scavengers Huang Xiaolin and others were also summoned. After questioning, because Huang and others firmly pointed to the officer extorting petty bribes, and it was confirmed by a number of witnesses, the case was escorted to the Shanghai Local Court for trial yesterday.</p>

<h3 id="e176">Invention of the Standard Exposure Meter <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>The key to the success or failure of photography lies in the exposure time. Photographers often fail due to incorrect exposure, resulting in monetary losses and missed opportunities. Famous photographers Lin Zecang and Gao Weixiang, in view of this, have spent years of effort inventing the "Standard Exposure Meter." It is exceptionally easy to use and can be learned in ten seconds. In just three seconds, you can get more than 130 kinds of exposure times. This invention is truly groundbreaking. Its use is based on relating the "hour of the month" to the "weather" to obtain the "total number" of various scenes and apertures for exposure time, surpassing various exposure meters in the world. Patents have been applied for in various countries. It is also heard that the "Standard Exposure Meter" can also save the "exposure time" for "motion pictures." It is ingeniously constructed and convenient to carry. It is already on sale. The list price per meter is one yuan and fifty cents, but it is currently on sale for only one yuan, plus one cent for postage. If you purchase a copy of the "Exposure Guide" with it, it will only cost an additional thirty-five cents. It is currently exclusively distributed by the China Photography Supply Company at 54 Nanjing Road, Shanghai. Wing On, Sincere, Hua Chang, Guan Long, Qi Chang, Ying Ming, and various photo studios also sell it.</p>

<p>Italy Has Not Agreed to Concede</p>
<p>Finland Also Wants to Compete with Japan</p>
<p>Dentsu, Oslo, 24th: The Olympic Committee, which will decide whether the Olympic Games will be held in Tokyo, will meet at noon on the 25th (7:00 pm Shanghai time). Before the meeting, Italian representative Bona Kosasagito told reporters that Italy had not conceded its original proposal to hold the games in Rome in 1940. The so-called concession was Mr. Sugimura's misunderstanding of Prime Minister Mussolini's words.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 25th: The Japan Track and Field Association held its first extraordinary general meeting yesterday to discuss preparations for the Berlin Olympic Games and the holding of the 12th Games in Tokyo. It also sent a telegram to the president of the International Track and Field Association, asking him to provide great assistance for holding the 12th Games in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 25th: The Japan Sports Association issued the following instructions to Sugimura, who is staying in Oslo, on the 24th: "The Diet has unanimously passed the proposal for Olympic funding. The government has also stated that this is a national undertaking and will provide full assistance to achieve the goal. Various difficult conditions such as distance have also been resolved. If it is decided to hold the games in Tokyo, it will have nothing to do with the World's Fair. The Olympic Games focus on sports-related matters. A joint government-civilian national committee will be established to handle everything. In Japan, where competitive spirit is the strictest in the world, holding the Olympic Games will absolutely not be confused with the World's Fair or regarded as a side show. Please make a final effort to make this fully understood by the members of all countries." The message was signed by Ryosan Hiranuma, Vice President of the Japan Sports Association.</p>
<p>Japan Union News Agency, Tokyo, 25th: The International Summer Olympics Committee met at noon on the 25th in Oslo to discuss various issues and decide the venue for the 12th Games in 1940. Japan has been actively advocating for the games to be held in Tokyo for years, but Finland is also enthusiastically promoting holding them in its capital, Helsinki. Finland has the support of European countries and intends to be elected. Therefore, the realization of the Tokyo Games is not optimistic. Japan sent General Sugimura to attend to request understanding from all parties.</p>

<p>Increase in Number of Schools and Students</p>
<p>Subsidies for Impoverished Counties</p>
<p>(Guangzhou Correspondence) Guangdong Province's three-year administrative plan stipulates the steps for implementing compulsory education in the province. Under the strict supervision of the Education Department, various county and municipal governments have been working diligently. In the 21st year, the province had a total of 19,145 elementary schools with 1,110,835 students. In the 22nd year, the number of schools increased to 19,267, and the number of students increased to 1,181,968. By the 23rd year, the rate of increase in both the number of elementary schools and students was even faster. The Director of Education, Huang Linshu, believes that implementing compulsory education in impoverished counties faces financial difficulties. Therefore, he has been granted permission to allocate funds from the provincial treasury for subsidies. This year, the subsidized areas include Ganen, Changjiang, Lingshui, Lehui, Fangcheng, Lingshan, Xuwen, Fengchuan, Kaijian, Nan'ao, Fogang, Ruyuan, Wengyuan, Lianshan, Yangshan, Lianping, Heping, Fengshun, Xinfeng, and Baoan – a total of twenty counties. Furthermore, outstanding graduates from the provincial elementary school teacher training institute and the provincial normal school have been selected and sent to the subsidized counties to serve as teachers, in order to improve the quality of education.</p>

<p>Municipal No. 5 Middle School to Be Converted into a Vocational School</p>
<p>Municipal Elementary Schools to Implement Two-Shift System</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Beiping) The Beiping Municipal Education Plan for the 24th year has been drafted by the Third Section of the Social Affairs Bureau and submitted to the Municipal Government for record. Our reporter interviewed Mr. Li Jingcheng, the Section Chief of the Education Section, to inquire about the content of the plan and the increased budget. Here is a summary of Mr. Li's remarks: This year's education plan for Beiping, in addition to establishing eight new elementary schools and two kindergartens, will focus on compulsory education. However, this type of education is financially challenging, and the location is difficult to determine. Due to limitations in educational talent and funding, a two-shift system will be implemented, either by dividing classes into morning and afternoon sessions. The specific method for implementing the two-shift system has not yet been decided and will be determined during the practical implementation phase. Regarding vocational education, a decision has been made to provide full support and advance the city's vocational schools. In the coming year, in addition to enriching the content, the number of classes will also be increased. The plan to convert Municipal No. 5 Middle School into a vocational school is currently under review due to excessive costs. Women's vocational education is also urgently needed, but due to financial constraints, it will be expedited. Regarding social education, efforts are being made to promote it. The People's Amusement Park being planned in Tianqiao has not yet found a suitable location, and it will serve as a public entertainment center in the future. The Ministry of Education ordered the Opera Academy to improve its scripts and has been instructed to submit a report, which is currently under review. As for the public sports field, the engineer Guan Songcheng has completed the drawings and submitted them to the Municipal Government. The Technical Office is currently reviewing them. Once approved, construction can begin. The Sports Committee has decided to hold a primary school observation and sports meet in the spring of this year. Whether the track can be repaired in time for the first sports meet is still questionable. Supervisors are currently conducting school opening inspections for all primary and secondary schools. After completion, random tests will be scheduled to review the performance of each school. Regarding the organization of a private middle school subsidy review committee, it will be carried out on schedule. The estimated increase in this year's education budget is approximately 80,000 yuan. (Jin)</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's schools for Chinese children have recently sent medical specialists to investigate the physical health of students. According to the findings, four students have extremely poor eyesight and have difficulty attending classes, and 48 students also have poor eyesight and urgently need treatment. This matter has been raised for discussion by the Education Committee. The question is whether they should be suspended from school or whether other methods of assistance should be sought. It has been found that three of the four students with extremely poor eyesight have already dropped out of school. The remaining one is currently wearing glasses and showing improvement. The schools can advise parents to provide students with appropriate glasses, but this is difficult for poor families. Perhaps the Council can negotiate with reputable opticians to arrange special discounts for students who need glasses. The Education Committee believes that school medical services should be expanded as much as possible, so that students with physical defects can be assisted as much as possible. Concrete measures will be discussed further. At the same time, the Chinese members of the committee will prepare to propose methods to assist poor Chinese families in need, so that they can be discussed at the next meeting. The chairman of the committee also stated that it is not necessary to spend all of the increased revenue, as the scope of assistance should be limited to those in the most urgent need.</p>

According to the measures proposed by the Chief of the Finance Department: (1) This fee reduction will be completely stopped in all Chinese schools for children; (2) The increased tuition fees can be used for scholarships and other purposes to promote Chinese education; (3) The fee reduction for foreign schools will be changed to a 10% reduction for two students, a 15% reduction for three students, and a 20% reduction for four or more students; (4) The increased fees will be used for scholarships or to pay tuition fees for poor students. However, it is difficult to investigate whether the students' families are in urgent need of assistance. The committee requested the Director of Education to conduct further research and report on how to use the fees that can be increased for foreign children for scholarships and assistance, and how to investigate the students' family circumstances. At the same time, the Chinese members of the committee are preparing to propose methods to assist poor Chinese families, so that they can be discussed at the next meeting. The chairman of the committee also stated that it is not necessary to spend all of the increased revenue, as the scope of assistance should be limited to those in the most urgent need.</p>

<p>The University of Shanghai held the groundbreaking ceremony for the Siwei Hall at 4 PM yesterday. Former University of Shanghai President Wei Fulan returned to the United States due to illness. Mr. Wei made great contributions since taking office at the University of Shanghai. Initiated by all teachers and students, it is planned to build a Siwei Hall as a lasting memorial. Mr. Wei was on the side due to poor health during the groundbreaking, and was supported by a car, so Mr. Wei's daughter was sent to perform the groundbreaking ceremony on his behalf, and all sent their best wishes. The Student Union presented Mr. Wei with four characters "Love others as yourself," and Qichang Photography took photos to commemorate the occasion.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Municipal Elementary Schools Increase Schools <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of the semester and academic year, municipal elementary schools in this city must increase the number of classes in order to accommodate children requesting to enroll. The schools that applied to the Education Bureau to add classes in the first semester of the 23rd year have been reviewed one by one by the Education Bureau. According to the amount of funding raised, it has been approved to add one class to eight schools, to hire assistant teachers for teaching in separate rooms to six schools, and to rehire assistant teachers as class teachers and to complete formal classes to eleven schools. Although the remaining schools also have many students, due to limited funding, the requests to add classes and hire assistant teachers have been temporarily put on hold.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of this semester, Principal He Shizhen of Chizhi College on Shuifang Road in this city has been actively promoting school affairs and sparing no effort. Recently, due to a sharp increase in the number of students, and after the merger of the girls' department, a guidance department for group activities has been specially established to assist in management and training matters. In addition, efforts are being made to expand school buildings and library plans, which are likely to be realized in the short term.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Scientific Research Work at Fukien Christian University <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>Fukien Christian University, a private university in Fuzhou, has been providing scientific education for many years and has a consistently excellent record. It has recently been reported that the science departments of the university are engaged in many specialized research projects, all of which have achieved satisfactory results. Here is a summary of several key points for those who care about science education:</p>
<p>Department of Biology: Professor Zheng Zuoxin's book "Biological Experiment Guidance," published two years ago, has been well received since it was published by the Commercial Press and included in the University Series. Professor Zheng is now also compiling a university biology textbook, and is currently organizing the manuscript. Once completed, he plans to submit it to the Commercial Press for publication again. In addition, Professor Zheng Zuoxin has also published two separate pamphlets on his research topics: "An Annotated List of Marine Fauna and Flora of Central Fujian: Amphibians" and "An Annotated List of Fujian Province." In addition, several papers have been published in newspapers and magazines, including "A Study of Metamorphosis in Frogs" and "Collaboration Issues in the Biology of Common Local Frogs."</p>
<p>Department of Chemistry: Professor Wang Tiaoxin of the department has been analyzing the chemistry of the Minjiang River for many years and has now reached the conclusion stage. The paper is being drafted and will be published to the scientific community soon. Professor Wang has also been specializing in food chemistry for many years. He has listed the types and amounts of vitamins in various foods that have been chemically tested. Among them, it has been discovered that the liver of locally consumed fish contains a particularly large amount of vitamins. It is said that if properly manufactured, its effectiveness is no less than that of commonly sold cod liver oil. In addition, the Department of Chemistry recently acquired a large meteorite weighing over 1,000 pounds from Minqing. It is currently placed outside the department's laboratory for students to view.</p>
<p>Department of Physics: The department chair, Professor Ma Chen, has been teaching at the school for many years and has rich knowledge and experience. Over the years, the department's experimental work has been based on lecture notes compiled by Professor Ma himself and distributed to students as guidance. The lecture notes have been revised many times, the content has been enriched, and the experimental methods have been improved. Professor Ma is now planning to print the book, and printing procedures are being negotiated.</p>
<p>It is also reported that Gan Jinghao, a top student in the Department of Chemistry at the university, was previously commissioned by the National Compilation and Translation Bureau to co-translate Julius Stieglitz's "Medicine and Chemistry" with Lin Guyin. The manuscript has now been completed and submitted for compilation. It is expected to be published in the near future for use by the domestic scientific community.</p>

<p>Communicate Chinese and Filipino Culture</p>
<p>The Ceremony Was Extremely Grand</p>
<p>(Manila Correspondence) Fine art is a means of promoting a country's culture and communicating international emotions. Although our military strength is not as good as others, our culture is developing and trending towards international dissemination. A case in point is the recent art exhibitions being held in various European countries featuring our art. Currently, the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts is holding an art exhibition in Manila, the capital of the Philippines. The Philippine education community is very sympathetic. Yesterday, artworks were exchanged. The work representing the Academy of Fine Arts was Wang Jiyuan's "Jiangshan Misty Rain," and the work representing the University of the Philippines was the "Banana Wind Thatched Cottage Landscape" painted by Rosario, the director of the Academy of Fine Arts and a famous painter. China and the Philippines have had hundreds of years of commercial and transportation history. If artwork is exchanged, this is the first time ever. The exchange ceremony held on this day was also extremely grand. The venue was held at the Academy of Fine Arts. The Philippine side was hosted by Muke, the president of the University of the Philippines, and the Chinese side was hosted by Consul General Deng. First, the president of the University of the Philippines announced the purpose, followed by Consul General Deng's statement that Chinese and Filipino cultures should be communicated, and the promotion of culture between the two countries would follow. Then, Wang Jiyuan, the representative of the Academy of Fine Arts, presented the Chinese painting and read the congratulatory message. The Philippine side also presented the Philippine painting by Rosario, the director of the Academy of Fine Arts, and took photos to commemorate the occasion. The large-scale exhibition will be held on the 12th of this month. Personnel from the consulate and the overseas Chinese community are helping with everything.

<p>I think men are not for women and do not need to wear suits and leather shoes. At the same time, women are not for men and do not need to wear makeup. Because apart from increasing the ability of each to attract the other, I cannot find any greater benefit for men themselves in suits and leather shoes, or for women themselves in applying makeup.</p>
<p>The abacus is a tool for arithmetic. It is only a faithful counting device. Whether there is an error or not, the responsibility lies with the person who uses the abacus.

<h3 id="e213">Idle Chatting in the Sun about Lice <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Lice, since ancient times, have been known as travelling dignitaries in books like "You Xiang Xu Jing Yu Lan", so it is clear that they are not entirely the domain of common people. Their bodies are long and oval, their mouths protrude, suitable for absorption, they have six feet, each with a claw, curved inwards, and a large abdomen, giving them the alias of "pipa insects." Wang Meng's talk of catching lice, Song Yu's ode to cooking lice, Ruan Ji's metaphor of lice in his underpants, and Jie Gong's poem of baking lice – the historical facts about lice are quite sufficient to aid people's conversations.</p>
<p>Catching lice and biting them with teeth is a beggar's habit. Wen Zhengming therefore has a poem about catching lice, saying: "Searching far and wide, striking with fingers and attacking with teeth." The description can be said to be exhaustive.</p>
<p>Lice are harmful to people, but there are also those who live because of them. During the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom era, Li Shouhui was valued by Yang Xiuqing. At that time, the examination hall collected tens of thousands of people who had shaved their heads. Xiuqing wanted to kill them all, but Shouhui knelt down and begged, saying that those who shaved their heads all suffered from sores and lice, and asked for them to be examined before execution. As a result, those who had sores and lice were spared death, saving more than ten thousand people.</p>
<p>Su Manshu's short notes are widely recited. He once wrote to Ya Zi mentioning lice, and it is recorded below: "Small garden with trees planted in rows, enough to wander around and admire. Sometimes I take off my clothes to look for lice and put them on the ground. A dwarf also feels around in his hair and takes out a louse, insisting that I transferred it to him. I said my louse came from my own body and is white, while your louse came from your head and is black. Why do you insist on blaming me? Although the dwarf was speechless, I am a citizen of a weak country, how can I live with dignity, how can I have peace of mind? How would Ya Zi know my sorrows and sighs?" At that time, Manshu was wandering in Japan.</p>
<p>Dongpo's Chanxi Collection says: "One day, Dongpo was feasting with Qin Shaoyou late at night when he suddenly got a louse on his body and said to Shaoyou, 'This is born of dirt and grease.' Shaoyou said, 'No, it is made of cotton wadding and dirty hair.' They argued for a long time without a resolution. Dongpo said, 'Tomorrow we will ask Buddha Seal. If I lose, I will host a banquet.' After the party broke up, Shaoyou secretly went to Buddha Seal's place and said to Buddha Seal, 'I just argued with Dongpo about the origin of the louse. Po said dirt and grease, and I said cotton wadding and dirty hair. When I come to ask, just say mine is true, and I will make a wonton meal for the feast.' Shaoyou secretly instructed him. Suddenly, Po arrived and instructed Buddha Seal, 'I just argued with Shaoyou about the origin of the louse. I said it was born of dirt and grease, and he said it was born of cotton wadding. When he comes, just say I am right, and I will make a cold dish meal for the feast.' After speaking, both went to question and argue. The Seal said, 'It's easy to understand, it's dirt and grease for the body and cotton wadding for the feet. First eat cold noodles, then eat wontons.' Everyone laughed loudly. This playful samadhi is delightful to read. I heard that this book is the first edition of the Zen Forest Series published in Tokyo, Japan, and there is no transmission of this book in our country.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Nine Deer Look Back <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>In my hometown—Songjiang—there is a famous ancient temple called Puzhao Temple. On the wall in front of the temple, there is a mural: "A vast plain, ten deer walking leisurely. Nine deer are looking back, gazing behind them, showing an expression of attachment; only one deer, heads high and strides forward, proceeding without any sense of trepidation." According to the elders, it is said that "this painting is a divine revelation, saying that the people of this locality are mostly attached to their homeland, with no ambition to go far, just like the deer in the picture. It is rare to find someone willing to abandon their wife and children and go to a foreign land, as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns." Although this kind of talk carries some superstition and ridicule, it also has some reality. Therefore, I am reminded of the national characteristics of various places.</p>
<p>"Guarding their homes and not willing to take risks." This kind of disposition is not unique to us Songjiang people; people in various parts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces also have this bad traditional concept. With a few houses at home, plus some movable and immovable property, as long as the family can make a living, they don't do anything. Sitting at home, accompanying their wives and children, and living out their lives. Therefore, I admire the people in Fujian and Guangdong, who have long sailed overseas to develop in Southeast Asia. Now, which of the islands in Southeast Asia was not conquered by our overseas Chinese? Although they are being invaded and ruled, that is a matter of national strength; the latent power is there after all. Secondly, one must praise the people of Shanxi in the past. Once a Shanxi person came of age, they abandoned their hometown and went to various places to engage in commerce. Therefore, before the establishment of banks, the major firms in various places were all opened by Shanxi people. On this point, one can also see the colors of the "Shanxi Boss."</p>
<p>Among the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the Ningbo people, "our fellow villagers," also occupy some influence, because they are able to leave their hometown and find a way to survive. Therefore, the strength of this ethnicity, the soundness of its economic power, and the firmness of its solidarity all depend on whether they can leave their hometown. I think if Columbus had been attached to his hometown, he would not have been able to find the New World. If Tang Xuanzang had been attached to his hometown, he would not have dared to go to India to seek scriptures. People who move forward should go out to find careers and not deeply embed the word "hometown" in their minds.</p>

<p>Chapter 9: Unable to Compliment, Seeking Help is Reprimanded, Unable to Return Home, Following Guests with Exaggerations</p>
<p>As he said this, Jia Duocai rushed forward two steps, bumped Zhang Jiefu with his arm, gestured to him with his eyes, and at the same time looked around at the people in this hallway. Zhang Jiefu understood that there were too many people here, making it inconvenient to speak nonsense, so he turned his face to Yueying and said in a low voice, "Can you go and sit in Master Jia's room? If you can go, we can think of a way for you, so that your mother and daughter will not be disappointed." Yueying listened to what he said and didn't think he was just talking nonsense. Thinking about tonight, the mother and daughter had come with great expectations. Now if they went home and told their aunt that they had only come back after being scolded, not only would their aunt be anxious, but she would also laugh at them for being useless. These past few days had already been uncomfortable enough because of her aunt's cold remarks. If she didn't bring back any news tonight, there would be more cold remarks in the future. How could one live such a life? Now that someone named Zhang had come forward to invite them, saying that there was a way to think, then it wouldn't hurt to listen to his ideas. So she said to Madam Hu, "Are you willing to go back and be scolded?" Madam Hu looked at him and said, "Why would I be willing to go back and be scolded?" Yueying said, "If we go back and don't have anything to say to our aunt, our aunt will never stop nagging." Madam Hu understood his intention, and said, "Okay, okay, let's go to this gentleman's room." Jia Duocai saw that his mother and daughter were coming, so he quickly slipped away back to his room first. Zhang Jiefu thought that he was just making it inconvenient to go into the room with Madam Hu and her daughter, so he slipped away first. In fact, such things were extremely common in the Little Western Paradise Inn, so why avoid it so much. He calmly led Madam Hu and her daughter towards Jia Duocai's room. (142)</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Fengtian, before we arrived, what a wonderful place it was to imagine! But now? We no longer feel any interest in it! If we were really forced to stay here forever, it would be the most unfortunate thing! So when we heard that person say that, we couldn't help but shudder.</p>
<p>One day, the Empress Dowager unexpectedly made the following statement to us:</p>
<p>"The day after tomorrow, we must set off to return to Beijing, because the date is already very close, and the Emperor absolutely cannot not return before the grand ceremony of worshiping the Imperial Ancestral Temple! Other things can be delayed, but this matter cannot be missed! So you must quickly prepare. — Besides, those silkworms we raise are about to start spinning silk; we naturally still have to go back and take care of them!"</p>
<p>This imperial decree was like pointing out a clear path for us: when we heard it, we immediately felt relieved, at least to the extent that we already knew the date of our return to Beijing. But alas! Tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, separated by no more than thirty or forty hours, but these thirty or forty hours seemed as long as thirty or forty days! The ominous feeling that we all shared, fearing that some disaster was imminent, became more and more obvious: we seemed to be racing against that imagined misfortune, not knowing whether it would catch up within these two days. Conversely, would it be too late to escape after two days? This terrifying illusion, once it entered the brain, of course prevented us from having our usual calm attitude! And the Empress Dowager, in general, seemed to have been stimulated by something and was irritable and easily angered; therefore, these two days felt especially long! (253)</p>

<p>Her body is hot, her eyes are watery; alas, she is sick! I anxiously and constantly try to feel her forehead; ah! I am willing to work hard day and night, as long as she is not sick.</p>
<p>She smiles, and I smile too; she cries, and I panic; I would rather abandon everything, as long as she smiles forever!</p>
<p>She is gradually getting fatter and whiter, but I am getting thinner and yellower. I would rather be skin and bones, as long as she gets fatter and whiter day by day!</p>

<p>The Smoking King of Europe: Among European countries, the country with the highest consumption of tobacco is Belgium. France and Italy have the same consumption. Italians consume half the amount of Russians and French. The Dutch and Germans consume about three times as much as the Russians and French. The Chinese consume twice as much as the Dutch, so the Chinese can be counted in second place.</p>
<p>The Oldest Cedar in the World: The oldest tree in the world is (1) a cedar tree in California, USA, which is now 2,500 years old, and (2) a silk cedar produced in the Indian tribes of Santa Maria in Mexico, which is already 4,000 years old. This silk cedar was just sprouting when the ancient Egyptian king hunted on the banks of the Nile. Today, it has grown to a height of 1,400 feet, making it an ancient tree unheard of in the world.</p>
<p>The Best-Selling Book: According to French newspapers, the best-selling book in the world last year was the Holy Bible, with a total of 10,061,740 copies sold in one year, an increase of 65,186 copies compared to the previous year. Therefore, the sales of the Bible are more welcome by the world than any other publication.</p>
<p>The Slaves of the World: Mrs. Simon, the U.S. Secretary of State, is the leader of the slave liberation movement. According to Mrs. Simon's investigation, the number of slaves in the world reaches 5 million. The people who sell themselves into slavery include the Liberians on the northeastern coast of South Africa, 10,000 of whom came from South America with the Americans. The next largest number is from our country.</p>
<p>4,000-Year-Old Skeleton: A farmer in Mezena, Italy, was plowing his land when he suddenly discovered a skeleton from 2,000 years before the birth of Christ. The skeleton was buried in a tomb 15 feet long and 10 feet wide. There were several coffins near the tomb, as well as many ancient swords made of bronze. Later, more excavations were carried out, yielding more than 50 skeletons. However, after the skeletons were taken out, they immediately turned into mud ash upon touching the air. According to the archaeologist Borgamoni's deduction, there were wounds on the skulls, which were indeed the remains of ancient soldiers.</p>
<p>A Strange Dissection: Since the progress of medicine, anatomy has also made amazing records. The U.S. Public Health Service, because of the indescribable mosquito infestation in Manila, had a certain anatomist dissect Manila mosquitoes under a microscope. As a result, Manila pathogens were taken from the salivary glands of the mosquitoes and used to manufacture blood serum. Injecting this blood serum into paralyzed patients can treat them.</p>
<p>A 7-Year-Old Academician: In Nicosia Street on the island of Savelais in Tojima, there is the son of a shoemaker who is unusually intelligent and is nicknamed "Different Interpreter." He can answer correctly in less than 30 seconds the question of how many hours have passed since his birth, and the question of how many pennies there are in 9 pounds, 13 shillings, and 7.75 pence. Therefore, he is called the 7-year-old academician.</p>

<p>Gold Price Changes Extremely Large</p>
<p>New Low Price of 872.5 Yuan</p>
<p>Central Bank's Spot Sales Result in a Drop of 6.2 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday's gold market saw unprecedented volatility and confusion. Initially, Chinese merchants sold off aggressively, the exchange rate was unusually strong, and a new low price after the new standard was created. Then the Central Bank intervened significantly with spot sales, immediately reviving buying interest, and the rebound was substantial, but ultimately the price still fell. In the early morning, overseas silver markets reported further gains, but sentiment continued to trend downward. In pre-market trading, the initial bid was 923 yuan, but it lacked support, and sellers rushed in, retreating into the 900 yuan range. The Central Bank's posted exchange rate was announced, with the British pound flat and the US dollar rising, and customs gold unit rising by 0.04. The standard gold price rose to 942.8 yuan. Although it had little impact, the market stabilized slightly after the fall. The morning opened with low prices, and after the opening, the price briefly rose four times to above 900 yuan. However, due to the strengthening of the exchange rate, sellers easily asserted their dominance, and the price soon fell back. Later, although banks gradually made purchases, the HSBC posted exchange rate was also long, and Chinese merchants poured out with all their might. The exchange rate gradually strengthened, and selling pressure in the market exceeded stability, causing a steady decline, eventually breaking the 880 yuan barrier. The selling subsided slightly, and the Central Bank reportedly intervened with spot purchases at a price of 981 yuan, slightly boosting buyers and causing a rise. However, large traders sold off at higher prices, making it difficult to sustain. Although there were settlements, they were only a slight struggle. Under the dominance of sellers, the 880 yuan barrier was broken again, and the exchange rate became even stronger. Banks also issued spot delivery orders, creating a low price of 874.5 yuan. Banks took advantage of the cheap prices to make some purchases, and short sellers covered their positions at the low prices, gradually improving the situation. The exchange rate stabilized slightly, and buyers were able to become active, rising back to above 880 yuan. However, the overall trend remained pessimistic, and sentiment remained fearful. The price fell again once in the late morning. After the noon close, the market stabilized slightly. In the afternoon market, the US dollar continued to strengthen, creating a new low price of 873.5 yuan after the new standard was implemented. Banks took advantage of the cheap prices to make some purchases, which then stabilized the market. The Central Bank repeatedly intervened with spot sales, and buyers were said to be extremely strong, seemingly accepting all offers. Various spot traders submitted orders one after another. Reuters also reported that the Chinese government had no intention of abolishing the silver export tax, causing the price to break above 880 yuan. Although there was fluctuation, Sassoon's purchase of forward contracts helped. The Central Bank continued to release more than 2,000 spot contracts. Buying interest in the market turned strong, and there were rumors of the Central Bank submitting orders. Fuxing, Yongdai, Runchang, Yong and others bought aggressively, breaking above 890 yuan. Finally, the exchange rate was normal, with a slight pullback. The day's market situation was volatile, and traders' psychology was uncertain. The trend was still difficult to be optimistic. Swap rates, with the Central Bank's spot sales price favoring buyers, continued to retreat to 5 yuan. The day's market situation is recorded below:</p>

The Central Bank's posted exchange rate was announced, the British pound was flat and the US dollar rose 0.0625, and the customs gold unit rose 0.04. However, due to the lack of confidence among Chinese merchants, it hardened immediately after the opening. Although the banks were buying, the Chinese merchants' appetite for selling was extremely strong. HSBC's posted exchange rate was announced, the British pound rose 0.25, and the US dollar rose 0.5 yuan. The exchange rate gradually loosened again. Later, with the Central Bank's intervention in spot sales, it was maintained. Outside, British and American tobacco companies slightly settled their accounts and stabilized. Unexpectedly, the confidence of Chinese merchants was still difficult to revive, and they unanimously poured out, making it difficult for the banks to cope. The process was loose and unlimited. The situation stabilized slightly at noon, but it was still uncertain and difficult to be optimistic. In the afternoon market, Chinese merchants continued to sell, and the banks once watched on the sidelines. The process hardened again. Later, Reuters reported that the Chinese government had no intention of abolishing the silver tax. The Central Bank opened spot sales fiercely, and Sassoon also came to cover their positions, and the process tightened. Finally, although Chinese merchants were buying, the banks took the opportunity to sell at high prices, forming a stable situation. By the time the market closed, the short-term selling price was British pound 1 shilling, 6.08125 pence, US dollar 38.125 yuan.

<p>The Money Market is Very Different from the Past</p>
<p>Trading in the Small General Association is More Active than the Early Market</p>
<p>Recently, the money market has not seen any relaxation in the morning and afternoon markets, and it is willing to release as much as possible, resulting in a calm situation in the early market. In the Small General Association, because the dealers did not release in the early market, there was a lack of funds in the top dealers, so they traded in the Small General Association, resulting in large transactions. However, some dealers were also squeezed and unable to participate. Since last week, there has been no change in foreign exchange borrowing rates, with the early market still opening at 9%, and the afternoon market the same. In the morning market, more than 2.5 million yuan was transferred for ticket trading, and more than 200,000 yuan was newly traded. In the afternoon market, more than 200,000 yuan was traded, and in the Small General Association, more than 800,000 yuan was traded. There was still no water added to the top dealers. Foreign mortgages have now opened for real estate transactions, so the market has improved slightly. Yesterday, more than 500,000 yuan was loaned out, more than 600,000 yuan was redeemed, more than 800,000 yuan in banknotes were recovered, more than 900,000 yuan in circulating coupons were issued, 400,000 yuan in marked coupons were issued, 200,000 yuan in customer sources were used, and 400,000 yuan were absorbed. Bank collections included more than 2.2 million yuan in foreign bank collection tickets, more than 3.5 million yuan in various goods, foreign exchange, mortgages, and miscellaneous collections, more than 800,000 yuan in special exchange collections, more than 1.1 million yuan in foreign exchange settlements, and 200,000 yuan in warehouse receipts. Chinese bank collections included more than 2.3 million yuan in ticket collections, more than 3.9 million yuan in various goods, foreign exchange, mortgages, taxes, and miscellaneous collections, more than 700,000 yuan in special exchange collections, more than 1.2 million yuan in foreign exchange settlements, and 300,000 yuan in warehouse receipts.

<p>Subsidiary Coins are All Stable</p>

Yesterday, Jiangnan small foreign coins still opened at 827 yuan in the early market, the same as the noon market the day before, and 4,000 corners were sold.

<p>The Bond Market is Turning Stable</p>
<p>However, the 96 Nian Three Barrier Continues Downstream</p>
<p>Today is February Delivery, No Market</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange only traded March futures for one month. The market was quite firm, and mostly slightly firm. However, because it only traded for one month, speculators could not develop, so trading was also limited. The environment has improved, and the market should be stable for a while. The 23rd barrier has not improved, and the situation after noon seems more stable. Its deposit balance is accumulating more and more. The market price has now reached a stable level, and is almost 10 yuan different from the highest price. With so much deposit balance, the market price will either not fall or will rise. It is feared that it cannot be stabilized in its current state. Currently, the 23rd barrier has become the only speculative target, so there will be more fluctuations in its future. Yesterday's experience, the morning opened with various groups maintaining the market, which is gradually materializing. The future of the money supply may recover slightly. Retail investors' buying appetite suddenly increased, and most market prices tended to be firm. The 20th barrier suddenly rose by 0.06 yuan, but the 23rd barrier fell sharply by 0.09 yuan due to the strong selling from companies 48 and 53. In the second round, various groups sold slightly, generally recovering about 0.01-0.02 yuan. The 23rd barrier continued to fall by 0.03 yuan. There were extremely lively buying and selling in both rounds. About 3 million yuan of the 23rd barrier was traded. In the afternoon, numbers 35 and 43 had a strong buying appetite, and the market price continued to improve by 0.01-0.02 yuan. After several raises and pushes, the 23rd barrier, although the lowest price was 70.01 yuan, ultimately rose by 0.02 yuan due to the purchases of number 43 and the reverse selling of number 53. The market for various bonds eased slightly in the late market, while the 23rd barrier continued to improve by 0.01 yuan. However, the result for the day was still 0.095 yuan lower than the previous week. The other varieties were slightly better by 0.01-0.035 yuan. Only the 20th roll was better by 0.07 yuan, and the 96 was slightly lower by 0.03 yuan. The total transaction volume was 13,105,000 yuan. The results of its gains and losses are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan, today is February futures delivery suspension,</p>
<h3 id="e222">Cotton Yarn <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>Cotton Yarn Falls More and More Fiercely</p>
<p>The yarn market continues to decline, and the situation is unusually weak. It lingered for too long last year, and the concept of looking high was too deep. Now it is moving in the opposite direction, and there is an unstoppable trend. In addition, the gold market is plummeting, and speculators are actively selling, making the market even more difficult to consolidate. However, some yarn mills have not yet resumed work, so the market can still rise slightly.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster is Particularly Strong in Selling Pressure The opening of the standard yarn forward market showed signs of instability in all months. Due to the bad news of the gold price, and there were many long position closures, the market became more difficult to support, and all months fell by 0.07, 0.08, 0.09 yuan to 1 yuan. The market was even more tired after the afternoon opening, and the arena was full of sellers. The reason was that the gold price broke through the 880 yuan barrier, and the raw cotton was also unstable, and the speculative world was actively shorting, so the selling pressure was particularly strong. In the second and third rounds of shooting, some profit-takers hedged, and the price rebounded by a few cents. As a result, each month fell again by 0.05, 0.06, and 0.07 yuan. It was found that Dafu sold 3,400 bales, Gengfeng 1,650 bales, Tongji 1,000 bales, Daji 1,500 bales, Mingde 1,100 bales, Hexing 750 bales, Changji 700 bales, Dafu 650 bales, Shengyuan 1,050 bales. Suilong bought 1,000 bales, Yuanda 1,300 bales, Jinchang 1,150 bales, Dafeng 1,300 bales, Hengde 1,500 bales, Shenji 900 bales, Changfeng 1,100 bales, Senkang 600 bales, and Yukang 650 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices during the day are as follows.</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Are Strong at 700 Bales The current yarn sales are still good. It was found that 705 bales were purchased by various groups throughout the day, the market price fell by 0.05 yuan, and the purchase amount of each group is as follows.</p>
<p>The flower market's selling pressure is intensifying, and Shanghai's cotton inventory is increasing. The factory side has reduced its demand for raw materials due to the low yarn price. The gold price has been falling recently, and the exchange rate has been rising, so the long positions are very panicked, and the spot traders are gradually becoming panicked. Therefore, the selling pressure is extremely fierce, and the market has fallen miserably. Only Yuanda has tended to go long when prices are low.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Fell Again by 0.06 Yuan The standard flower market opened in the early market, and the situation was still depressed. American cotton fell by more than 0.1 pound, and Indian cotton rose by 2.25 rupees. However, the gold price fell, and the exchange rate rose sharply. The selling pressure in the market was still strong, and the long positions painfully closed their positions, flocking in. The market became more and more difficult to stand firm, and each month fell by 0.035 to 0.055 yuan. The sales force was surging like a tide after the afternoon opening. Because the gold price was at a low point, having seen 873 yuan, the Ningbo gang increased its sales efforts, and the momentum was unusually fierce, so the first round also found a new low point. The short side made up for the second and third rounds, and the price rose slightly by 0.01 yuan. It was still weak at the closing, and as a result, each month fell again by 0.005 to 0.012 yuan. It was found that Suilong sold 7,400 dan, Dafu 5,300 dan, Tongji 3,300 dan, Tongxing 7,000 dan, Changfeng 1,800 dan, Shengyuan 6,300 dan, Runkang 5,300 dan, and Yuanxingchang 4,600 dan. Tongji bought 6,700 dan, Meiji 4,300 dan, Yuanda 4,200 dan, Jinchang 3,600 dan, Hengde 3,000 dan, Shenji 6,100 dan, Tonghe 2,000 dan, Changfeng 3,800 dan, Xincheng 2,000 dan, and Dachang 2,100 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices during the day are as follows.</p>
<p>Manufacturers are Slightly Active The current cotton consumption is slightly active, but the price is falling, and there is no source at all.</p>

<p>Flour and Wheat Plummet in Unison</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, after the market opened for flour, prices for all months uniformly plummeted.  Chicago quotations for foreign wheat fell by ten cents, or around eight cents, while Canadian quotations fluctuated by four cents.  Based on the foreign wheat quotations, there was actually little room for significant price movement.  However, after the opening prices were set, the gold price plummeted and the exchange rate soared, naturally loosening the acceptable price for current foreign wheat.  The factories' orders would inevitably adhere to the environment and allow for sales.  Therefore, at the opening, the current month's price only fell by one cent due to the tightness of spot goods.  For deferred months, however, sentiment was very weak.  New short sellers took advantage of the exchange rate and sold off in layers.  Most bulls also took the opportunity to sell off their holdings, causing the market to continue its downward spiral.  By the afternoon opening, as the acceptable price for foreign wheat became even more favorable, with Argentine wheat as low as $4.30, sentiment weakened further.  More bulls eagerly unloaded their positions, and the continuous selling by new short sellers led to an unstoppable decline in deferred markets.  In the end, the current month fell by 4.5 cents, March by 5.25 cents, April by 6.75 cents, May by 7 cents, June by 5.25 cents, and July by 4.25 cents, it is said.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market experienced a uniform and sharp decline in prices for all months during both the morning and afternoon sessions. Based on foreign wheat quotations, Chicago fell by only eight to ten cents, while Canadian quotations fluctuated by four cents. At the opening, the current month was suspended from trading due to completed delivery. The quantity delivered was estimated to be over twenty cars. Initial prices for deferred months remained stable. However, as the price of gold plummeted and the exchange rate soared, sentiment weakened. The flour market also trended downward, further exacerbating the situation. By the afternoon opening, with the loosening of the spot foreign wheat market, sellers took advantage of the situation, and bulls closed their positions at a loss. Consequently, the decline was particularly violent. As a result, March plummeted by 13 cents, and April by 16 cents. The spot wheat market situation saw a sharp drop in standard wheat prices, with asking prices also falling by five or six cents.  The opening price for Guidet-Shandong wheat was $3.85, for 3,000 bags, purchased by Fuxin Shenda, it is said.</p>
<p>Overseas Wheat:  July wheat turned flat due to reports of dust storms in the Southwest winter wheat region, but buying was sparse and cautious.</p>
<p>Over 200,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Flood the Market</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market was quite weak. A total of four ships arrived in recent days, including 4,000 tons of "Small Twist" rice imported by the "Harper Line" ship. In addition, the "Good Or Mars Peck" and "Erie Cai Pace Smara" ships brought a total of 150,000 to 160,000 bags of Saigon rice. A batch from a Japanese merchant shipping line also arrived last night and will be docked and unloaded today. In total, the four ships carry approximately 200,000 bags of foreign rice. Consequently, both the market and sentiment were trending downward. Yesterday, due to the rain and few customers, a total of 7,000 bags of foreign rice and 550 bags of Hunan Machine Red Rice were opened for sale. Among them, 600 bags of "Small Twist" and 200 bags of "Min Dang" were purchased by this local street vendor. The rest were distributed inland. The "Small Twist" rice is the newly arrived goods from the night before last. Prices have dropped by five to ten cents, it is said.</p>
<p>Rice Market Clears Due to Rain</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, more than ten dealers arrived with goods totaling nearly 2,000 piculs. Amidst the continuous spring rain and few customers, the market situation felt even more sluggish. Although the market supply was thin, prices continued to decline. Each bag of thick japonica rice fell by about ten cents.  Seven or eight hundred bags of late rice were purchased by Qingdao and Yantai dealers, and prices continued to fall by nearly ten cents. Du Jian rice was weak, Yin Bian Yuan rice continued to soften.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, due to continuous rain, few boats arrived from the river, only a little over ten. There was no trade in various goods on the market, and prices for all varieties were soft. Although the sales of Ke Jian and Qu Wei rice were not brisk, the market remained stable.</p>

<p>Chaoqing Ground Price Rises 30 Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw excitement in Shanghai as Shantou telegrams reported that the Chaoqing ground price rose another 20 to 30 cents.  First-grade Chaoqing was priced at $10.30, followed by $10 to $9.23. Over the past two days, a total of over 2,000 bags were offered. On the 24th, first-grade Chaoqing was $10.60, and Huanggang Chaoqing was $10.20 to $10.00, an increase of 30 cents. Lower grades were poorer; semi-Nam Chaoqing was $9.60, and Longqing was $9.45. Yesterday's opening saw Huanggang Chaoqing at $10.23, ordinary at $10.50, and Nanqing at $9.67, an increase of about ten cents. Longqing remained unchanged at $9.45. First-grade Zhuangqing was quoted at $11 per bag due to shortages, but no transactions occurred.  Over 500 bags of Jiazi Qing opened at $9.10. Over a hundred bags of Hainan red opened at $10.67, a decrease of five or six cents. Over a hundred bags of Zhiyang opened at $12.80 to $12.60, a decrease of three or four cents, but the production price has rebounded. In addition, the Sugar Industry Cooperative Company auctioned off 818 bags of Guangdong coarse white sugar for $17, a decrease of 20 cents. 700 bags of transshipped Dutch coarse white sugar were sold for $4.90, a small decrease of ten cents. Taikoo sugar, due to its poor quality, only fetched $17.30 to $17.40, resulting in no transactions. The factory's refined white sugar has been gradually reduced by 20 cents over the past two days, with Zhenyu No. 1 at $16.80, No. 2 at $16.70, No. 3 at $16.55, and No. 4 at $16.40.</p>

<p>Medium and Small Longans are Scarce and Prices Rise</p>
<p>Longan sales have remained sluggish recently, and prices have loosened. Large longans have not seen any price increases, so transactions have been sporadic, with prices ranging from $31 to $32.  There have been no transactions for ordinary large longans.  Medium and small longans have seen price increases due to low inventory and arrivals, with various dealers taking positions.  Prices opened at $20 to $25, an increase of about $2 compared to last year. (Longan meat) is scarce in both arrivals and inventory. Tong'an goods opened at a $1 increase, and Shima goods opened at $69, and further tightness is expected.</p>

<p>White Lead Sheet and Blue Lead Bar Trend Weak</p>
<p>The white lead sheet market has not seen any development recently, so trading has been very sluggish. Although various dealers have made every effort to promote sales, the environment is unfavorable, and there are few buyers. Therefore, the market situation is very pessimistic, and prices are declining. For example, No. 2 is estimated at $26.50 per picul, Nos. 3 and 4 at $26, No. 5 at $25.75, No. 6 at $25.25, No. 7 at $25, Nos. 8 at $24.50, and Nos. 9 and 10 at $24.25, a decrease of two or three cents compared to the previous market. However, recent credit conditions have been tight, and the tea market has not yet started, so only small batch transactions have been opened.</p>
<p>Blue lead bars are trending weaker due to numerous arrivals and scarce mountain road traffic.  The market has an oversupply of spot goods, and sentiment is panicked, so prices have repeatedly declined.  Each picul is estimated at $14.40 to $14.50.  For large quantities and cash transactions, the price can be even lower.  Yesterday, only two or three hundred bars were offered, and it was reported that yellow lead factories and paint companies made no purchases.  Therefore, the market situation is unusually weak.  Moreover, the foreign exchange rate has eased significantly in recent days, and Xiang lead is continuing to arrive, making the trend even less optimistic.</p>
<h3 id="e227">Oil Market <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>White Tung Oil from Zhejiang is Higher than from Hankou</p>
<p>White tung oil from Zhejiang has traditionally been cheaper than tung oil from Hankou, allowing local firms to engage in export business. However, since the end of January this year, Zhejiang fully weighted goods have had to be sold for $31 per picul, but the highest price sold to foreign firms is only $32 including tax. After deducting the tax of $3, only $29 is received, a difference of about $2. Therefore, local firms engaged in the export of tung oil have stopped trading. Moreover, the market in Hankou only sells to foreign firms for around $30. Compared to this, Hankou tung oil is actually cheaper than Zhejiang tung oil. Therefore, local markets have not heard of any foreign deals for a long time. However, the production in Zhejiang is not sufficient to supply foreign sales, so even without export channels, it is sufficient to maintain the status quo. The Hankou market has recently remained between $30.20 and $30.30, but foreign firms have only made small supplementary purchases, failing to generate interest.  Furthermore, the source is not strong, and traders are not willing to short sell without significant foreign demand. Therefore, the market feels dull. Traders are selling Xiang tung oil at around $25, and southern branch oil at $24.70 to $24.80.</p>

<p>— Xiang Yu</p>
<p>I am not entirely certain if there is such a person in the world, but in my intuition, I always believe that there is someone who sits in the clouds and constructs unreal facts. Naturally, their position is lofty in the clouds. Constructing tall tales is naturally improper from a certain point of view. However, they still need to construct these unreal facts. Whether they are fools, deaf, blind, or mad is up to others to judge. As for themselves, they don't need to and disdain to argue. What they care about is the construction of unreal facts. The term "unreal" suggests that fantasy is a significant component. However, there is also reality within. Therefore, it is not entirely fantasy, nor entirely real. But the third party can also see the reality, and also see the fantasy. Of course, the fantastic part is greater than the real part, which is an open secret that does not need to be revealed.</p>
<p>For the constructor himself, the function of fantasy and reality is different. It is not necessary to seek complete reality! Nor is it necessary to seek complete fantasy. Therefore, fantasy and reality are equally valued. This is not something that the third party should find strange. Therefore, the constructor hates and is most unwilling to be asked: To what extent is the constructed unreal fact true, and to what extent is it illusory? In the constructor's own view, whether the constructed unreal fact is true or not is irrelevant. Legendary stories and recorded historical facts are equally welcomed. Although the purpose of the construction is different, and the target audience attracted is different, the truthfulness is not a major condition. In addition, what the constructor hates and is unwilling to be asked is: What is the basis for the constructed unreal fact, when did it happen, and where did it happen, because the basis, time, and space are also irrelevant. Humanity's past, from the very beginning, is still a mess. We are naturally trying to clarify the events of the pre-historical period. For the events after the existence of history books, there are only records of the lives of a few people, and most of the life records are still omitted. From the primitive cave dwellers to the modern us, there have been hundreds of thousands of years in the course of time, but we have nothing remarkable. Only the means of mutual slaughter, mutual killing, and mutual devouring are slightly more sophisticated. Therefore, this group of constructed unreal facts can occur in the most barbaric society of the Ximen in Africa, in the society of the Eskimos living in the Arctic Circle, in the so-called highest white material civilization, and in the so-called highest spiritual civilization of the yellow people. Although the unreal facts themselves are not very simple, their universality is consistent.</p>
<p>There is no society in the world that is completely idiotic, but there are many societies filled with not too few and not too many idiots. There is no society in the world that is completely deaf, but there are many societies filled with not too few and not too many deaf people. Although there is no society in the world that is completely blind, there are many societies filled with not too few and not too many blind people. There is no society in the world that is completely insane, but there are many societies filled with not too few and not too many insane people. But these people may be me, may be you, may not be me, or you, because we do not seem to be qualified enough. We are all clowns who cannot accomplish great deeds or do great evil. This is what a clown is. Most qualified people seem to be noble rather than ugly. We have the stench of nobility, but it is not very strong. So at most, we are only fit to help with odd jobs and join in the fun. There is no share for the protagonists. Even if there is a share, it is not large. What is the reason for this? This is probably because the set we play is regarded by those who think they are not foolish, not deaf, not blind, and not insane as the most useless. Just like flies dancing with lamp wicks, after working for a long time, there is not much of a plaything that is made. Of course, the flies themselves think it is no small matter. In this sense, we may be flies, our sticks may be lamp wicks, and my voice may be the voice of flies, the buzzing sound. It can be determined that it cannot resonate throughout an era. On the other hand, it can also be determined that it is the most annoying to those who are not foolish, not deaf, not blind, and not insane.</p>
<p>Those who are buzzing and cursing themselves for buzzing, and those who are buzzing and cursing others for buzzing, are not necessary, because buzzing is always buzzing. It is not a bad sound!</p>

<p>— Fei Er</p>
<p>Xiang Di wrote to me, telling me that Gua Lu was recently destroyed by fire. Regarding the disaster for my loving friends and little friends who have lived on the banks of the Gua Lu River for three years, a huge tragedy suddenly arose in my heart.</p>
<p>For five years, Gua Lu has been submerged in the rampant recession. Fishermen have no fish to catch, and fish prices are so worthless; the government raises tax rates, and small businessmen suffer the misfortune of bankruptcy; the children leave school one by one, and the dark iron palm immediately presses on them. …</p>
<p>A village city that has been established for nearly a hundred years is now finished! The fate of Chinese colonies! The fate of poor people in a recession!</p>
<p>I recall five years ago, when the fire spread everywhere at the beginning of the recession, I, no, we also worried about the arrival of the fire every day, but I did not expect the people of Gua Lu to survive for five years, and now they have died! For the poor people who catch fish and shrimp, for the bankrupt small businessmen, for the unemployed workers and shop assistants, and for the poor children who have dropped out of school, what way out will the world arrange for them? For my loving friends and children, when I am still groping and struggling on the dark path of life, what comfort can I give them?</p>
<p>Curse this world! Curse the imperialists who desperately exploit the overseas Chinese and their big bellies! Light the flames of resistance against this world! Spread the fire all over the earth!</p>
<p>For the oppressed poor lower-class overseas Chinese, let them raise their heads and open their eyes wide to see the disasters that are spreading all over the world! Let them explore the future path of this world from the personal pain after the disaster!</p>
<p>Friends, build a new path of life well! Poor little friends, my companions for three years, may you have a better destiny in another world!</p>
<p>I threw down my pen and sighed. From the window, I stared blankly at the bright sunset in the west as it approached.</p>

<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>I often read Zizhi Tongjian until the section about Emperor Yang of Sui traveling south to Yangzhou, and recorded:</p>
<p>(1) When Emperor Yang of Sui arrived in Jiangdu, his debauchery increased. More than a hundred rooms were built in the palace, each filled with supplies and beauties; each day, one room was designated as the host, and the emperor, along with Empress Xiao and his favored concubines, visited each room for banquets, with wine cups never leaving his lips.</p>
<p>(2) The emperor himself understood divination and fortune-telling and liked to speak the Wu dialect: he often set up wine banquets at night, looked up at the stars, and said to Empress Xiao: "There are many people outside plotting against me; but I will still be a part of the Great Wall, and you will still be Empress Shen, let's enjoy drinking together," and then he became drunk.</p>
<p>(3) He also once held a mirror and looked at himself, and said to Empress Xiao: "Who should chop off this fine head!" The empress asked in surprise, and the emperor laughed and said: "Nobility and cheapness, suffering and happiness, alternate with each other, what harm is there?"</p>
<p>(4) When the emperor heard of the rebellion, he tried to escape through the west gate; a beauty pointed him out, and school captain Linghu Xingda drew his sword and went straight forward, helping the emperor down the gate and leading him back to the sleeping palace. Qian Tong, De Kan, and others stood guard with their white knives drawn. … The emperor's beloved son, Prince Zhao Guo, the twelfth, cried bitterly by the emperor's side; Qian Tong beheaded him, and blood splattered on the emperor's thighs. The rebels wanted to kill the emperor, and the emperor said: "There is a proper way for the emperor to die, why add blades? Bring poison wine"; Wen Ju and others did not allow it, and ordered Linghu Xingda to force the emperor to sit; the emperor used his trained towel sash to strangle Xingda to death!</p>
<p>This tragic drama can also be written as a very hot and lively affair. We usually read history and casually flip through it, picking out the shining historical events that catch our eye. Over time, all crab eyes naturally become subjects, and there is no need to worry about being barren.</p>
<p>After finding the subject, we can use many methods to write it. The first one should be the paraphrase method. In Su Dongpo's poems, there is a poem called Shao Bian, "Taking Tao Yuanming's 'Returning Home' and slightly paraphrasing it to suit the rhythm and rhyme, and leaving it to Dong Yifu, so that his family servants can sing it." The poem says:</p>
<p>"I bent my waist for rice and abandoned my family for wine, my mouth and body are mutually burdened. Return! Who does not wish you to return? I feel that everything in the past was wrong, now it is the dew that is about to dry. The travelers point me to the way home. Children laugh and talk in front of the door; alas, the old chrysanthemums are all overgrown, and the new pines are growing old. I am now so old! But the small window can hold my knees, close the wooden door, and leaning on my staff, I watch the lonely clouds and the evening geese fly; the clouds come out unintentionally, and the birds know when to return, it was not intentional.</p>
<p>Alas, return home! Now I forget myself and forget the world. Relatives have no frivolous words, and there are good meanings in the qin and books. Walking on the green hills is rugged, floating on the stream is secluded, and the trickling dark valley flows with spring water. Seeing the flourishing of plants and trees, the recluse feels emotional, and my life is about to end. Thinking about how long will I be in the universe? I unknowingly wonder where I am going. I entrust my heart, who cares about going or staying? Where do immortals live? Wealth and honor are not my ambition. I only know to whistle and sing by the water and climb the mountains, and I pour wine and get drunk by myself. How can I doubt the destiny of this life? Let's go with the flow, and stop when we encounter obstacles.</p>
<p>Such paraphrasing of the articles of the predecessors is a writing method of historical sketches; Sima Qian's Biography of Qu Yuan and Jia Yi used this method to write Qu Yuan's Li Sao. The historical records have these two great figures and events, and the facts are known to almost every woman and child. If you want to write it into a sketch, you can only use this paraphrase method.</p>

<p>— Xing Wen</p>
<p>Although she still teaches me to forget her, she is not without emotion. She teaches me to forget her because she hopes that I will work hard for my life. She knows that in a year or two, I will fulfill her hopes. God, I am willing to love everything about myself for her sake. She will not let me down, she will never want me to forget her forever. The letter paper is as white as mutton fat jade, and the delicate handwriting carries her unique rationality. The vigorous and elegant hook and stretch can make people imagine the new plums on the Fanghe Pavilion. She is thin, and the words are also thin. The spring breeze and willow branches are thin, but there is the wisdom and fairy flavor of Xiaoxiang bamboo.</p>
<p>I have received many letters, and many of them are from daughters, but in my life, no letter has made me so infatuated. When I received the letter, I was still writing a very urgent and important article. After the letter arrived, the world completely changed, and the article could no longer be written. I closed myself in a small room, letting the loving and pure brilliance emanating from the letter spread throughout the room, and let me be immersed in this loving and pure light. I was not reading the letter, I was simply touring the fairyland. She wanted me to forget her, and I felt that this sentence contained infinite comfort. Her rationality, her determination, her perseverance, and her disapproval, with an emotional word, made me feel the preciousness of her asking me to forget her.</p>
<p>Like a melon skin boat in the vast sea, today I suddenly found myself berthed on a fairy island. The fairy island will not bully me. In a year or two, someone from the fairy island will come to welcome me. I must work hard for my life. My life has no shortcomings. My loving mother will laugh for me, and although there is no brother, my sisters will also be happy for my happiness. My many teachers and friends who love me and help me will also be happy because of the completeness of my life. I am a happy person, this letter tells me, my happiness will last forever.</p>
<p>The letter is in my chest, and it has now turned very warm. I put it on my cheek, and I seem to be receiving the holy mother's loving kiss. I gently recite Tang Linchuan's beautiful sentence: "But do not betray each other in our thoughts, for the road to three lifetimes is at the Peony Pavilion." Rain sounds on the twenty-first.</p>

<p>Their straw sandals have covered the deep alleys, a hundred circles, but they can't step into the door of the iron fence. There are chanting grandmothers and charitable ladies. Although this is an unfinished feudal remnant, the appearance of the West represents the era of the twentieth century! The high walls block the blind man's thoughts. The child's shoulders have made his one hand sore all day long; the child's eyes have become his vision. The "ding ding" rings, but he cannot call anyone to ask about the passing years. Is that the rustling sound of the wind? He pricks up his ears and measures what kind of call it is. He paused for a moment, and his disappointed straw sandals dragged up the dust again!</p>

<p>— Qu Yi</p>
<p>Just like this, Hu Yiyuan smoked pipe after pipe. His heart was fluttering. He forgot all the difficulties in front of him: the bank's suspension of payments, the upper line's urging of funds, the approaching Mid-Autumn Festival, the delay in insurance premiums, the coldness of the market, and the tightness of funds. Only "this thing" was real.</p>
<p>"Chi--" Another pipe was finished. Hu Yiyuan then temporarily pushed the pipe aside and sat up. From one side of the kang bed, he picked up a pot of hot tea. He exhaled on it twice and put down the teapot to straighten his back. He turned his head and smiled at the big belly opposite him. "How about it? Have another pipe."</p>
<p>The big belly straightened up. His body moved slightly. The thick black eyebrows pressed down on his eyes and lifted upwards. A wide smile cracked on his pumpkin-shaped face.</p>
<p>"If I have another pipe, that's fine, but--" The big belly picked up the pipe and said, "But--have you had enough?" His words revealed flattery and also revealed the timidity in his heart.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, come on," Hu Yiyuan said, bending his legs into an arch and hugging his knees with both hands. Then he slightly chanted in his mouth:</p>
<p>"Ascending the mountain, I asked the boy,</p>
<p>He said the master went to gather herbs;</p>
<p>Only in this mountain,</p>
<p>Where the clouds are deep--unknown."</p>
<p>As he chanted, his bare toes rose and fell in time with the rhythm. Once the big belly had filled the pipe and started to puff, circles of pale white smoke spread like clouds over the entire kang bed. Hu Yiyuan suddenly had a flash of inspiration and turned back to ask:</p>
<p>"What do you think, what kind of medicine did the master go to gather?--I think he must have gone to gather tobacco paste. Because the clouds are deep and unknown! Don't you think our eyes are exactly like 'where the clouds are deep and unknown'? Hahaha!" As he said this, he burst into laughter. Without waiting for the big belly to praise his clever discovery, he was already eager to praise himself.</p>

<h3 id="e235">On Daily Life and Diet <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>Since people have to live, they must have daily life and diet. Daily life and diet are an inevitable form of life activity in the process of people from birth to death.</p>
<p>Daily life and diet are nothing more than trouble. Not only are they most troublesome, but also most monotonous. For example, you get up in the morning and go to sleep at night. It's not enough to have lunch, you have to swallow dinner again. How troublesome! Today's daily life and diet are like this, and tomorrow's daily life and diet are still the same. How monotonous!</p>
<p>But once you get used to it, you can live in peace.</p>
<p>However, although daily life and diet are the same, each person's "tricks" are different from each other. Let's start with the rich. In the eyes of the poor, the rich's daily life and diet are the most comfortable. They live in Western-style houses, eat delicacies from mountains and seas, and travel by car. Isn't this comfortable enough? Those who say it is not comfortable are not content! They don't know that people's suffering is only understood by themselves. The rich's daily life and diet are indeed comfortable. But you don't think that some people are tired of sitting on sofas, their backs ache, and some people are tired of eating bird's nest, their stomachs ache, and they are crying bitterly!</p>
<p>The daily life and diet of the poor are completely different from those of the rich. They can sleep on the ground at the entrance of the alley, and they can eat fried dough sticks with sesame flatbread with relish! It seems that they are much happier than the rich. They have no money or accounts to settle, they sleep through the night as one day, and eat a meal as half a day. How leisurely and carefree! Maybe some rich people envy them, just like the poor envy themselves!</p>
<p>However, both daily life and diet are similarly troublesome and equally monotonous. God treats the world equally, probably on this point.</p>
<h3 id="e236">The Lonely Patient <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>It was a misty, rainy late night. Raindrops pattered against the window. As the accumulated water increased, it trickled downwards like earthworms, weaving countless earthworm avenues across the entire pane of glass. To the moaning patient, suppressing his groans, it was simply a sketch of life!</p>
<p>(Humans are as insignificant as earthworms, and the path of life is like the path of an earthworm. If it encounters a towering rock, it marks the end of its lifeline).</p>
<p>Whether the patient's lifeline had reached a point of interruption, he himself felt it was a huge question, but that towering rock had already crushed his soul. He had once used his head as a sharp axe, flashing with primitive, uncontrolled violence, to cultivate it. Although his life force had not been wasted, the melting of the rock did not proceed as he had hoped.</p>
<p>(Reality is built on people's excitement, and it is also destroyed by people's excitement. Look! Ahead lies a vast and boundless desolate road, where many are sacrificed as energy, and many are sacrificed as libations)!</p>
<p>The patient waved his hand in a daze, his head spinning along with the room. The room felt even narrower, making even breathing impossible. A pot of holly on the shelf had also withered, its color as haggard and dim as a sixteen-candlepower electric light. A dark, oppressive wardrobe seemed like a coffin, its mouth open, waiting for his corpse to fill its hungry belly. At this moment, the cold sweat on his forehead, oozing like the glass on the window, formed earthworm-like ripples. His intuition was death! Death!</p>
<p>After two days of illness, he could not get out of bed. A wave of heat passed, and then a wave of cold attacked, the sweat-soaked quilt pressing down on limbs that seemed about to fall apart in pain. The windows and doors were all tightly closed, and the room was filled with carbonic acid, sweat vapor, and the smell of paint from the walls, intermingling and pervading, slowly congealing his breath. His heart felt like a dried-up riverbed, cracked into tortoise-shell patterns, and he wanted to find some tea to moisten it, but there was none. If he were unconscious, he could have fortunately rested for two days. But no, he was exceptionally clear-headed, systematically playing back everything on the screen of his mind. What about the future? Pink dreams were also vividly outlined and beautiful, but now, the doors hadn't been opened for two days, he hadn't eaten for two days, and he was as desolate as sleeping in an ancient tomb!</p>
<p>(In this world, there are many who are rejected by happiness! Happiness adorns herself with a crowned colorful dress, with a fair face and pearly lips. This sacred virgin teases the thoughts and pursuits of countless people! Look, for her sake, many are sacrificed as energy, and many are sacrificed as libations)!</p>
<p>The demon of illness violently bound him, and at this moment he felt that death was the only release.</p>
<h3 id="e237">The Story of the Candle Flower <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Jia</p>
<p>"Look, what a long candle flower!"</p>
<p>Ten-year-old Chen stood in front of the table, staring in astonishment at a large red candle on the candlestick and shouting. The other children in the room also focused their attention on the inch-long candle flower, each innocent face floating with a sweet, childlike smile.</p>
<p>"Where does the candle flower come from?" Six-year-old Zhen asked mysteriously.</p>
<p>No one could answer, and they stared blankly at each other.</p>
<p>"I know," after a moment of silence, the oldest, Chen, shouted triumphantly, "I know. The candle flower comes from the Bodhisattva. My mother said so."</p>
<p>The children were satisfied with this answer. However, a new question arose: "Why does the Bodhisattva have candle flowers growing?" This was asked by Yun, who was sitting on a small chair. Yun was an eight-year-old girl, the most beautiful of the children.</p>
<p>"Candle flowers are blessings. Luck." The answer was still from the oldest.</p>
<p>"What is a blessing?" Ling asked.</p>
<p>"And what is luck?" Yun asked carefully.</p>
<p>"Blessings and luck are the same thing," Chen replied lightly. He was competitive and eager to maintain his "knows the most" honor, so although he felt very empty inside, he still tried to remain calm.</p>
<p>"Then, what exactly is it?" Yun asked.</p>
<p>"Blessing is luck, and luck is blessing, you fool!" Chen replied loudly.</p>
<p>The children looked at each other in confusion. Although they were full of questions, they were afraid of Chen's loud voice, so they remained silent.</p>
<p>"Luck is a blessing, blessing is luck... Hey, do you understand? I don't understand!"</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>The voice came from the other side of the table. Everyone turned their eyes to that side and discovered Yu, a boy slightly older than Zhen, who had not spoken at all.</p>
<p>"Don't understand?" Chen became a little angry, "So stupid! So, so stupid!"</p>
<p>Everyone fell silent again. No one wanted to be called "stupid," because the word "stupid" had already established a bad concept in their simple minds. But they couldn't prove that they weren't stupid.</p>
<p>"I really don't want to talk to stupid people!" Afraid that new questions would arise, Chen said these words harshly and walked out, swaying. The remaining children had long faces. But soon, everyone's attention was focused on the big red candle again.</p>
<p>"Look, the candle flower!"</p>
<h3 id="e238">On the Seven Seas Ocean <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Qin</p>
<p>The ship sailed out of Shantou harbor and reached Annam, Siam, and other places. In between, there was a stretch of ocean that the villagers called the Seven Seas Ocean, and they often mentioned it with tones of amazement. People from Lingnan remembered the Seven Seas Ocean from afar! Returning overseas Chinese excitedly waved their hands and talked at length: "The Seven Seas Ocean, the seawater is frighteningly black! Boundless, ah, truly boundless; the waves are as big as mountains..."</p>
<p>More of the people on deck were able to get up and walk around. Suddenly, someone shouted: "We've passed the Seven Seas Ocean!" The tone was so joyful: "Look, look, isn't that a mountain? We've passed the Seven Seas Ocean!"</p>
<p>I also tried to calm myself and shook my still dizzy head, and couldn't help but whisper inwardly: "The winds and waves of the Seven Seas Ocean are really not small!" The impression left in my mind as a child surged up with some trembling. On the Seven Seas Ocean, how much sorrow and suffering of the people of Lingnan is buried!</p>
<p>Recalling the Seven Seas Ocean that had just been crossed, it seemed as if the ship was still rocking, as if still under the attack of the wind and waves, and a hateful shadow immediately surged up. The few days of life on the Seven Seas Ocean weighed heavily on my heart.</p>
<p>This ship, called the Yuanli, a regular ship, went to Annam and was well known to all guests. Every time it sailed, it was sure to carry many new passengers to foreign lands to make a living. Among them, there were also many women going to foreign lands to find their husbands. These kinds of villagers were filled with bitter sorrow, leaving their homes and venturing to the ends of the earth. Looking at the green water of Shantou harbor was already heartbreaking, and drifting on the Seven Seas Ocean, who would not be alarmed and saddened!? How many people, after drifting across the Seven Seas Ocean, can return to their hometowns in glory; but many people, after drifting across the Seven Seas Ocean, never have any news; some are buried again and again in the giant belly of the Seven Seas Ocean.</p>
<p>With a heart filled with remorse and melancholy, I boarded the Yuanli in a small boat. On the noisy deck, I found a berth at random and sat down, feeling depressed.</p>
<p>As the ship slowly crawled out of the harbor, a burst of crying came from the bottom of the hold, increasing my troubled mood and making me uneasy. Listening to the incessant crying of the women, playing the desolate and heart-trembling folk songs, I reluctantly went down to the bottom of the hold to see. I did not dream that it was Sister-in-law Zao and several other women crying, their hair already showing some disarray, and the children and babies were also crying, looking at their mothers. The new passengers wore crying faces. The entire bottom of the hold was so dark, a desolate and unbearable sound, and my heart was so soft that I couldn't stand. Why did Sister-in-law Zao come overseas! I suddenly remembered the honest and silent Sister-in-law Zao. When I was young, I even thought Sister-in-law Zao was a widow! When I grew up, I learned that there was a Brother Zao in a foreign country who hadn't returned for more than ten years. Every time Sister-in-law Zao asked the returning guests, they could only say that Brother Zao's face was black from eating, and the rest was very vague. After guarding a living widowhood for more than ten years, without receiving any definite information, why would Sister-in-law Zao run away? And what would happen when she got to a foreign country!? At this moment, she didn't seem to recognize me, not calling me uncle as usual. Looking at her face, I was a little scared! It seemed as if I had a premonition that terrible things were about to happen. The ship gradually rocked violently, and I couldn't help but feel dizzy, so I had to run upstairs. I couldn't care about what happened to Sister-in-law Zao. Hearing people talk about the Seven Seas Ocean, the travelers' hearts became even more chaotic. The ship tossed me all day and all night, causing me to vomit non-stop. Coupled with the wind and rain, the ship was sealed, and I was as unbearable as a seriously ill person. It was on the afternoon of that day of great wind and rain that the ship was filled with various cries. A woman next to me told me that Sister-in-law Zao and another woman had jumped into the Seven Seas Ocean. My heart felt like it had been hit hard by a hammer. The ship continued to rock, and I passed the Seven Seas Ocean in a daze, unconscious. The cries and chaos in the ship, I didn't have the strength to open my eyes and look. My head was so painful, and my heart was so remorseful and depressed!</p>
<p>"The Seven Seas Ocean is indeed passed!" I heard someone shout, and suddenly woke up, as if waking up from a nightmare. Looking at the sea, far away, it seemed to be gradually turning green. But I still couldn't help but shout inwardly: "The Seven Seas Ocean..." In the belly of the Seven Seas Ocean, how much sorrow of the people of Lingnan is buried!</p>
<h3 id="e239">Window <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Mu</p>
<p>On the south side of the bedroom, there is a four-panel casement window. Every morning, the sound of birds awakens me from my deep sleep, and this window gives me endless and far-reaching interest.</p>
<p>When you are silently and peacefully curled up on your pillow, facing the distant sky outside the window, and cotton-like clouds slowly drift by, your thoughts follow the changing clouds and become still, and all the suffering of the world disappears without a trace. The sky is vast and the earth is wide, with no strife or ugliness. Your whole being is dissolved in the light, plain, and tranquil beautification.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the posture of a hawk chasing the clouds catches your thoughts, and you will slowly have the meditation of flying. After a while, the clouds are dyed with red sunset glow, and the brilliant halo radiates over, and your cheeks seem to be dyed red as well. At this time, your heart is fluttering as if you have drunk a light amount of brandy, you think of the beautiful dreams of the night before, gently biting your lower lip, and smiling slightly.</p>
<p>If you move your gaze down slightly, there is a row of power lines like a five-line staff flowing across the sky to the right. Several sparrows, not knowing where they flew from, stand leisurely on the line, forming notes of high and low scales. After the wind blows slightly, the poplar leaves beat the rhythm, and simple and innocent melodies are scattered from the sparrows' mouths. You listen quietly and will no longer be annoyed by the sparrows' chatter. Everything feels round, harmonious, and lovely.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when your thoughts are immersed in this round and harmonious realm, suddenly, a line of black shadow flashes past like lightning, the notes on the staff are scattered, and the melody is suddenly interrupted. At this time, you will feel an endless empty silence, and your heart will be slightly disappointed.</p>
<p>As the sunset glow in the sky gradually disappears, this beautiful morning also quietly disappears in your disappointed mood.</p>
<p>In the evening, the window gives you another kind of interest. It is a faint, velvet-like light sorrow. Most of the time, it is when people are asleep and the night is quiet, and the croaking of frogs across the alley disturbs your sleep. In the light gauze tent, you look out at a corner of the sky outside the window, and the twinkling stars flash charming eyes and whisper to you. You will meditate that the corner of the deep sky is the sea, and the stars are the sea lights. When a meteor drags its afterglow and falls towards the endless end, a sense of lonely, mysterious, and ethereal feeling steals into your heart, and you will then turn your thoughts to the fleetingness of life and the vagueness of happiness. Your mood is faintly woven with a velvet-like light sadness.</p>
<p>In the bright moonlight of the night, when you wake up from a dream, there is a burst of light, the sky is quiet, and sparse stars are scattered in between, and there are often light silk-like clouds flickering and passing by. At this time, you are lying on a cool mat, and your thoughts are slowly caught by homesickness. You recite Li Bai's lines, "Before my bed, the bright moonlight shines, I suspect it is frost on the ground. I raise my head and gaze at the bright moon, I lower my head and think of my hometown," and your heart seems to have turned into a cloud, floating into the sky, lost in control, lost in dwelling, it is an endless ethereal, endless illusory.</p>
<p>So, you jump out of bed, lean against the window and face the woods and the corner of the building in front, silently lost in thought. You will hear the crickets at the foot of the wall drumming their clear and exquisite wings to praise this beautiful summer night.</p>

Just because poor scholars cannot have much good fortune. Towers and pavilions are everywhere near the fragrance. Can only temporarily borrow the nest of a wren. Go around the garden of a wealthy family. Write poems to express the shame in my heart. Brandish the brush on the wall with a glorious platform. Only see the trees lushly forming a winding path. Several famous flowers emit a faint fragrance. The rich fragrance sways with the wind. Slowly the fragrance is raised. A graceful posture with gentle bones and charming. The drunk color on the face reveals a beautiful air. The wind turns the flowers and trees dancing together. A light posture with a smiling face. The playful young master has no hidden bones. How can he recognize the long meaning of famous flowers. There is a kind of empty garden with rich flower affairs. Teaches荒荒 everywhere. Therefore, vulgar people are not worth associating with. For famous scholars recognize strange fragrances. The beauty of spring cannot be confined in the garden. Red apricots are interspersed with green willows on the wall. Peach blossoms fall into the water and follow the waves. Cinnabar purple and嫣紅 reveal endless light. The human world and heaven are vast.</p>

<p>— Zhu Jiabo</p>
<p>After Jimei was sent to that school for the second time, he was taken to Dr. Williams, a professor at the University of California, for a psychological examination. Then Jimei returned home with his mother to await the school's notification of whether or not he would be admitted. If his physical examination results were too far off, or if the psychological examination revealed excessive emotional instability, Jimei would have no hope of admission. However, if what Dr. William discovered was merely a spoiled child whose problems could be corrected to make him a good citizen, he would still have hope of being admitted.</p>
<p>On Jimei's first day at school, he spent almost the entire day in the laboratory of the head of the physical education department. The head of the physical education department was named Mark Maxwell. He used silhouette photography to capture the outlines of various parts of Jimei's body in numerous films, and then observed his physical shortcomings from those films. He also had to take footprint impressions, test the strength of his hand grip, the weight-bearing capacity of his shoulders, and the length and thickness of his legs. The shape of the top of his head, his heart and lungs, the sound of his muscle contractions, his nutrition, his skin—in short, every part of his body had to be examined in detail and compiled into various forms.</p>
<p>By the time the examination was completed, it was almost late at night. Mark Maxwell then gathered his three assistants and jointly drafted a physical training program for Jimei for the year. His sloping shoulders should be exercised more with pulling motions. How to gradually develop his lax muscles. His fear of pain should be given special attention in swimming and calisthenics. The next day, Jimei entered the kindergarten class. Because of California's spring-like weather all year round, the kindergarten class's lessons were conducted outdoors year-round. In the same class, he met Peter Bennett, the son of Constance Bennett, and his cousins Diana, Joan Bennett's daughter, Helen Hayes' daughter, Manford, big-mouthed Joey Brown's daughter Elizabeth, and many other celebrity children.</p>
<p>Jimei's teacher at this time already had a detailed report, she knew that he was overly sensitive, unsociable, destructive, bullying, and curious. She used many carefully planned games to correct the above problems one by one. She slowly instilled in him the ability to control himself, a fair attitude, and kind thoughts. His hands, which were used to destroying things, were kept busy making various earthworks and woodworking things. Soon, he found creating things interesting and completeness lovely. Later, he did not like to destroy things or tear pictures out of books.</p>
<p>He painlessly acquired the habit of a nap from 11:00 to 11:30. This was something he could not do at home no matter what, but at school, an hour of gymnastics every morning, from 10:00 to 11:00, had created a healthy fatigue for him, making him automatically willing to take a nap.</p>
<p>However, it took several months to overcome Jimei's fear of water. He initially refused to enter the swimming pool. But Mark Maxwell still made him wear a swimsuit every day and sit on the side watching many children of the same size as him splashing, laughing, and playing in the water. When he saw a girl even smaller than himself floating on the surface of the water, head down, learning the first style of crawl stroke, Jimei himself felt a little ashamed. The next day, Jimei automatically walked into the swimming pool. Mark Maxwell then patiently supported his body and taught him how to use his hands and feet. In less than a year, little Jimei could already swim from one end of the swimming pool to the other, with his head submerged in the water and his legs paddling a truly American-style crawl stroke. This kind of thing is just a glimpse of a gradual training of an elementary school student, and Jimei is just an ordinary kindergarten student.</p>
<p>The safety and health of the children are protected with meticulous care. Jimei's school authorities also have comprehensive arrangements for preventing kidnappers' activities for a class of children. Every student must go to the lobby of the general office before going home. There is no second exit from the entire school besides the lobby. Principal Brownt waits for them in the lobby and personally sends them to the public bus or private car. No student is allowed to leave the school alone. Whenever a student's family sends someone to pick up the student, their parents must personally introduce that person to the principal in advance before they can come to the school to pick up the student.</p>
<p>A year easily passed, and Jimei had already entered the first grade of elementary school. He is in the classroom every day from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. You might think that such a long time of homework is too serious for a six-year-old child. However, he is now a burly little man who can withstand long periods of training. He is also very interested in homework. His teacher, Lucy Green, teaches him a short poem or a short speech every day, and asks him to copy and recite it himself. Often on Fridays, when all the students gather in the auditorium, she calls Jimei to stand in front of the public and recite the poem or speech. This can exercise his memory and prevent him from having self-conscious thoughts in public places. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e244">Review of "Tear Stains" <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Hualun</p>
<p>——Carlton Cinema</p>
<p>After watching "Tear Stains" on the screen, one cannot help but feel a little dizzy.</p>
<p>War destroyed peaceful villages and scattered the families of farmers. The escaped young man, Zheng Youcheng, had no choice but to take his old mother and weak younger sister and plunge into the torrent of misery and hardship from the twists and turns of life. In the turbulent real society, one could easily sort out a theme for a script. From this unfolded work, it should have been possible to write it extremely vividly and profoundly. However, due to the confusion and superficiality of the screenwriter and director's material cutting and screen weaving, the drama they had captured was lightly let go, leaving only a pile of traces in a fleeting glimpse.</p>
<p>Most importantly, such as in the conversation between the mine owner and the accountant, it was not directly stated that under the foreign capital invasion, the operators of national enterprises had no way out and had to surrender to foreign forces, prolonging their lives, and after signing the contract, they could only take the road of exploiting labor. Giving the audience a deep attention to this contract from the side. Therefore, the workers' deliberations that followed could not give people a heavy feeling. And the screen let go of this light feeling, starting another stove for a lengthy scene of mining life and fainting; furthermore, the design and performance of the foreman falsely accusing Youcheng—one of the workers—of being imprisoned in order to obtain his sister as a concubine to fulfill the master's sexual desire pulled the audience hard from the labor-capital dispute to the atmosphere of how the master strongly seduced Aying, hid her, and the wife was jealous. Emphasizing Youcheng's personal revenge and the foreman's venting after being released from prison to create drama led to a conclusion that departed from the theme.</p>
<p>Because the original theme was determined with the life of the miners as the base point, there were more scales on the screen about the mining area. However, because the producers did not cherish the materials they selected enough and were not good at applying them, they were only used repeatedly, rigidly, superficially, and as landscape paintings. The development of the plot was neither organically linked, nor was it sufficient from the point of view of being a single screen beauty. Isn't it? In imagination and reality, the mining area should be so majestic and profound; and the life of the miners, in many films' descriptions, is so dark and bleak! But here, from the framing, angle, light, as well as the actors' actions and expressions, the appropriate flavor was not given.</p>
<p>Because the characters in the play do not have clear outlines and personalities, the actors are only acting superficially. Tan Ying, a female character who can act, also did not develop well. Zhao Ya does not have uninhibited enthusiasm and heroic performances. He Feiguang and Wei Helin are relatively more accomplished.</p>
<p>It is said that this "Tear Stains" has been cut and revised many times. Naturally, here we can only talk about what we have seen on the screen.</p>
<h3 id="e245">Review of "Marriage Agency" <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Jihan</p>
<p>Bachelor Bait - Da Shanghai Cinema</p>
<p>"The temptation of unmarried men," "Bachelor Bait," what a tempting title! Marriage agency, makes people imagine: there is such a house, inside there are many sex-crazed men and women, she or they need sexual comfort, she or they are waiting to get married to each other. When the cat calls on the roof, this kind of film is so tempting for some people! At the same time, we will not forget the definition of soft gentlemen's films: "Give the eyes ice cream, give the soul a sofa chair." We believe that films like this "Marriage Agency" will make them feel extremely satisfied.</p>
<p>In the eyes of some American writers, film is just this kind of sex-crazed thing, just like in the eyes of Chinese soft gentlemen. Sex-crazed men and women are mixed together, women must be bare-chested, men must smoke cigars and wear tuxedos, I love you I want you crazy love, the transaction of spirit and flesh, each other's bold posture, indulgence, lewdness... these become the necessary content of the film, and the playwright or director's expression of these in the work is the completion of the greatest task.</p>
<p>"Marriage Agency" is such a work. Here, playful dialogue is used to the fullest, and the characters in the play are selling their charms to the fullest. Cunning, frivolous, humorous, and satirical constitute this light comedy. However, we cannot find any reality here. We follow the characters in the play and laugh unconsciously. Like in a dream, walking out of the theater door, this dream disappears. This happiness is like a puff of green smoke passing before our eyes, leaving only the reality of suffering and sorrow that is tightly pressing on us.</p>
<p>Yes, the role of this film lies in making people temporarily enjoy and temporarily laugh. We point out that it is unrealistic. On the contrary, it makes the audience forget the cruelty of reality, which is precisely the authors' intention to whitewash peace. But the impression of "World War I" will not disappear in people's minds. For this kind of film, they only feel a bitter smile in the end.</p>

<p>— Guocheng</p>
<p>Sometimes, a person's life and hope are almost centered on the issue of marriage. Whether you are fat or thin, short or tall, young or old, poor or rich, if you do not have a good family, you will feel that your body and mind are unowned, and your life has no home.</p>
<p>"Marriage Agency" (Bachelor Bait) is a proof of the above facts.</p>
<p>This is a humorous comedy film starring Stuart Erwin, Rochelle Hudson, and Pandie Callenden.</p>
<p>The film depicts Stuart Erwin's journey of pursuing the truth of marriage. According to his own opinion, he said that all men and women in the world should legally become good partners. Therefore, everyone can be given an opportunity to become a useful "marriage material"; and he guides a romantic school with this theory, teaching students how to be romantic.</p>
<p>The business is thus unfolded, but jealous villains broke in, and things went downhill. At that time, Stuart Erwin almost lost his ideal lover.</p>
<p>"Marriage Agency" is directed by George Stevens and opens today at the Da Shanghai Cinema.</p>

<p>Lulan Belles spent a lot of time to get some evidence, and spent a lot of thought. But when she presented this evidence in court, the court, under the authorization and instigation of the powerful, did not accept her evidence, but instead rebuked Lulan Belles. Lulan had no choice but to retreat. She was thinking of ways to continue fighting with this evil force. She must find a way quickly, otherwise it would be too late.</p>
<p>While Lulan Belles was sitting and thinking deeply, the other party's group of people were also discussing this matter in their office. Their conversation was something Lulan Belles could imagine. Jie Lai said angrily: "This old woman is too annoying. She interferes too much." School inspector Helunte hurriedly replied: "Yes. I also feel that way." Jie Lai asked: "How long is her term of office before we can ask her to retire?" Helunte said: "According to the regulations, her term of office is still two years." Jie Lai frowned, as if he was very impatient, and said: "I'm afraid we can't wait for her to retire automatically..."</p>
<p>Lulan Belles stood up and went to the window of the principal's office. It was already very late, but the lights in the principal's office were not turned on yet. She stood and looked at the street outside. Across the road was Dede's place, which was brightly lit, attracting pedestrians to stop. Once the door there opened, a burst of music and sound spread out from inside. Lulan Belles' eyes had now shifted to an empty house next to Dede's place, where a "for rent" sign hung. She couldn't help but say to herself: "Clarence Dede, one day that sign will hang on your house."</p>
<p>The door of the principal's office opened, and a strong beam of light shone in from outside. Lulan Belles quickly turned around and saw her assistant Meilis walking in, standing in front of her and saying: "Miss Belles, it's getting late." She replied: "Yes," but her thoughts were still across the street. Meilis flipped through several pieces of paper in his hand and said: "There are a few things here..." Lulan Belles said: "Okay, please put them on my desk. After I read them tonight, I'll discuss them with you tomorrow morning." Meilis agreed and put down the things in his hand.</p>
<p>He walked to the door, stopped again, and murmured: "About that Dede thing, Miss Belles... I... I want you to know, I admire everything you do... I admire you for having such courage." Lulan Belles smiled and said: "Mr. Meilis, thank you." Meilis also said: "You are so devoted to the children, but they don't get any good." Lulan Belles said: "Oh, you can't blame them for that either. They go to Dede's place because that place is fun. I don't think it's drinking or gambling that tempts them to go to that place—children, liking to play and liking to be happy is their nature... and..." He didn't say any more, because a vague plan suddenly arose in her mind. Meilis suspiciously said: "Maybe that's the case. Miss Belles, is there anything else today?" Belles said: "No. See you tomorrow."</p>
<p>After Meilis left, her mind was thinking faster and faster, thinking about the new plan just now. She walked behind the desk, just about to sit down, when suddenly someone knocked on the door again, and three students followed in. Those three students were all particularly favored by the principal... Huade, she had helped him a lot in the debate, just like she had helped another student—that student is now the president... and William Boden, she had helped him to study the corner of Wen Zhi, so that he would not be held back, and at the same time enable him to continue the football team's work, winning the championship for the Yafangtai'er area... and Nepotong...

<h3 id="e248">New Trends in Housing Problems in 1935 <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Xiri</p>
<p>Since this city was affected by the Shanghai War, according to statistics, the population of the concession has suddenly increased by more than 23%. Therefore, small residences, lane houses, and shikumen have become the target of public criticism. As soon as the topping invitation is issued, there are many people who snatch it. I have personally seen a house with no decoration, but the topping fee is as high as more than 600 yuan. From this, it can be seen that despite the tight social economy, this item of expenses still cannot be eliminated. However, there are not many people who inquire about office shops and other houses. Looking back on the real estate business in Shanghai last year, two very significant trends occurred. One is the realization of high-rise development and the gradual westward expansion of commercial and cooperative land along the Bund to places such as the Racecourse. A section in the city center, such as the new building of Guangdong Bank, the building of the Four Lines Savings Association, the steel-framed building of the Yong'an Company's expanded address, and the Daxin Company, which is being excavated, are towering high, almost like Shanghai's "Wall Street." The rest, such as apartments, with four or five floors, have been increasingly built in the northern and western districts of Shanghai. On the border of the French Concession, there are several extremely high apartment buildings of this type, which will soon be completed. According to a corner of the Public Concession, the value of this type of building has totaled 2,388,150 yuan from last year to the present; calculated as 601,600 yuan in the eastern district of Shanghai, 23,700 yuan in the northern district of Shanghai, 823,450 yuan in the central district of Shanghai, and 939,400 yuan in the western district of Shanghai. The Belgian Apartments on Kunshan Road and the Hu Si Apartments on Zha Pu Road, etc., were built in the previous two years and are not included in the statistics. The rise of this type of small and simple housing is nothing more than following the needs of the social people. Apartments with low rent and complete facilities are more and more popular among all walks of life, especially the type with two or three rooms, with rent from 75 to 100 yuan, is the most common. Among the tenants, except for a few foreigners and Japanese, most of them are Chinese tenants. For example, there is a four-story apartment in the French Concession, which has recently been completed, divided into one, two, and three rooms, etc., and it has now been fully rented, of which three-quarters are Chinese. The creation of this trend is actually because apartments are more convenient. Such as new-style equipment, rent includes heating, tap water, and miscellaneous expenses such as zero tax, making daily life gradually simplified, but convenient transportation is an even greater reason.</p>
<p>Our usual housing problem has always been based on lane houses and shikumen as the central premise, and we have suffered enough from various housing difficulties. Apartment-style housing is giving us a new life reform. The gradual trend of residents to apartment life, who says it is not a good phenomenon of this year.</p>
<p>Now, comparing the total building value of the city at 55,880,000 yuan with that of 1933, it is naturally overshadowed. However, as mentioned above, under all unfavorable conditions, construction will increase or decrease due to population relations, but the panic of social economy and the decline of commodity prices are inevitable trends! Therefore, the value in construction is also slightly lower. This cannot be said to be a decline in the entire construction of Shanghai. I remember that Professor Li Jia, the director of the French Academy of Sciences, in his speech not long ago, observed the trend of the world's population. Within the next ten years, Shanghai's population will definitely exceed Berlin, London, Moscow, and Chicago and rank third, due to its current seventh position among the world's major cities. This shows that the architectural development of Shanghai's future is just in its ascendant. We can further speculate that the construction of the Public Concession will move to the construction of the city center in the future. In fact, there is indeed a possibility. Just looking at the construction towards the city center last year is a clear proof!</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding Shanghai's real estate, it is also necessary for us to know about it in the past year! The golden age of Shanghai's real estate gradually declined last year. This is not due to the sharp drop in real estate prices, but because the speculators engaged in real estate transactions shifted their focus and focused on other speculations. Therefore, the amount of transactions decreased by 70% compared with 1933; it was found that the total transaction amount in eleven months of 1933 was 40,088,300 yuan, while in the same period last year, it was only 11,869,550 yuan. Now, the monthly transaction amount of eleven months last year is written below. From January to March, it was 3,753,214 yuan, of which the western district accounted for 1,400,546 yuan, the western district of Shanghai 1,335,916 yuan, the eastern district of Shanghai 401,835 yuan, the French Concession 408,917 yuan, and the city center 2,606,000 yuan. From April to May, the total amount was 2,288,000 yuan, of which the central district accounted for 1,100,000 yuan, the western district 507,000 yuan, the western district of Shanghai 266,000 yuan, the eastern district of Shanghai 117,000 yuan, and the French Concession 298,000 yuan; in June and July, because it happened to be hot weather, the total transaction amount of real estate was only 1,766,900 yuan, which, except for the 12 months during the Shanghai War, was the lowest record in the past six years, of which the French Concession accounted for 663,900 yuan, the city center 355,800 yuan, the western district 320,000 yuan, the western district of Shanghai 227,000 yuan, the central district 121,000 yuan, and the eastern district of Shanghai 79,200 yuan; The transaction in August and September increased slightly compared with the previous two months, with a total amount of 2,075,000 yuan, of which the French Concession accounted for 578,000 yuan, the central district 550,000 yuan, the western district 286,000 yuan, the western district of Shanghai 110,000 yuan, the northern district of Shanghai 48,000 yuan, the eastern district of Shanghai 44,000 yuan, and the city center 459,000 yuan; in October and November, it showed a state of withering again, with a total value of 1,976,000 yuan, of which the eastern district of Shanghai accounted for 801,700 yuan, the western district 407,800 yuan, the northern district of Shanghai 380,000 yuan, the central district 172,000 yuan, the western district of Shanghai 25,000 yuan, and the French Concession 189,500 yuan. If the transaction amount of each district in eleven months is counted, then the western district is 2,921,346 yuan, the western district of Shanghai is 1,963,916 yuan, the eastern district of Shanghai is 1,443,735 yuan, the French Concession is 2,143,717 yuan, the central district is 1,943,000 yuan, the northern district of Shanghai is 428,000 yuan, and the city center is 1,056,800 yuan. Looking at the above transaction statistics of each district, it can be understood that the real estate in the western district, the western district of Shanghai, and the eastern district of Shanghai is better than other districts. The gradual development of Shanghai's industry in recent years and the concentration of inland asset holders in Shanghai after the bankruptcy of the countryside have led to this. However, the relationship of road construction across the border is also another reason for promoting the good real estate transactions in the above three districts. Finally, this article was written hastily, of course, it is not exhaustive, and I hope readers will correct it.</p>
<h3 id="e249">Noteworthy "Courtyard" Design <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Pillow Wood</p>
<p>Indeed, the architecture of old-style Chinese houses is simple and monotonous. It doesn't possess the magnificence of foreign buildings, nor the sophistication of Western-style houses. Its shortcomings include: shallow foundations, loose structures, wasteful materials, uneven weight distribution, and so on. These have all been criticized and refuted by others. However, in the opinion of this reporter, the so-called "courtyard" in Chinese residential architecture is truly an outstanding feature of old-style buildings, unmatched by ordinary Western-style houses. It is well worth our attention and study.</p>
<p>It should be known that old-style Chinese houses are often counted in "advances": one advance has a main room and two side rooms; two advances have a 口-shaped "encircling enclosure." Beyond that, there are three advances, four advances, up to seven or nine advances, varying in number. Each advance generally has five bays, seven bays, nine bays, etc., differing from each other. At the very least, it must have three bays to be called an advance. Between two advances, there must be a "courtyard." The size and length of the "courtyard" vary, differing according to the terrain. Or, if there are more bays, the wide "courtyard" is divided into three to five small "courtyards" by low walls, each being different. But essentially, they are all "courtyards."</p>
<p>The "courtyard" is also called "heavenly well." Considering its name and pondering its meaning, one can understand that it is a blank, open-air square space in the construction of the house. The location of this kind of courtyard is roughly as described above. Its structure consists of paving the open space enclosed by walls on all four sides with stone slabs or bricks. The patterns and designs are also left to one's own preference, while the stone strips framing the edges are uniformly patterned, which is very simple. As for its effectiveness, it is quite significant: it can circulate air, allow light to penetrate, eliminating the worry of darkness and the disadvantage of stuffiness. Moreover, it is also called a "heavenly well," which can be used to dry clothes and store rainwater, making it an even better option in rural areas without running water. Indeed, in Western-style house construction, you see nothing but tall buildings, without this excellent design feature. This is an advantage for the Chinese. We may as well combine Chinese and Western styles. In places where land is cheap, if there is great construction, it is advisable to adopt the "courtyard," which is truly very convenient. However, construction must advance, and the base of the "courtyard" must be solid and even. The surface can be steel-reinforced concrete, ceramic tiles, granite, or even grass, etc., all depending on economic capacity. The aesthetic aspect must also be designed to achieve perfection.</p>
<h3 id="e250">General Situation of Shanghai's Construction in the Past Year (3) <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Dehui</p>
<p>Speaking of construction in the urban area, we must first understand that in the past, urban construction wasn't particularly developed. Since the establishment of the municipal government, there had been a vigorous atmosphere, but the January 28th Incident caused it to wither again. Although the god of war is indeed terrifying, the gradual increase in population, regardless of the environment, eventually led to a gradual revival. Moreover, the municipal government's efforts to realize the Premier's Greater Shanghai Plan further stimulated urban construction, which is the main reason why urban construction showed a trend of development last year. In the six months of the previous year, the total value of construction was 12,283,000 yuan, an increase of 44 percent compared to the construction in the 22nd year of the Republic. Comparing the total value of the same period in the last three years, then, the 21st year of the Republic was 1,123,000 yuan. In the 21st year, due to the January 28th Incident, it was only 4,023,000 yuan. The 22nd year was 8,531,000 yuan. Such a rapid increase is a good sign for the future construction of the urban area. Here, the classification of construction includes 916 houses, 174 stores, 75 factories, 17 warehouses, 14 offices, 22 schools, 7 churches, 3 hospitals, and 6 other buildings. Among them, the Pudong Alcohol Distillery's construction value was the largest, about more than 400,000 yuan. The construction in July and August was worth about 4,350,000 yuan. The construction in September and October decreased slightly, but it still reached 3,431,000 yuan, including 326 houses, 69 stores, 15 factories, 9 warehouses, 3 schools, 3 offices, 2 churches, and 1 hospital. As for November and December, because there are no statistical materials at the moment, I dare not make any definitive value, but from the total construction cost in the ten months, reaching 18,927,000 yuan, the average calculation is 18,927,000 yuan per month, which is about 8,000,000 yuan more than the total of 10,841,000 yuan in the French Concession in ten months. However, compared with the total of 25,212,000 yuan in the Public Concession in the ten months, there is a difference of more than 4,000,000 yuan. This is because of the environmental relationship of the Public Concession, so in the new construction of the whole city, it can always be the first every year. As mentioned above, the construction of the Public Concession can represent the construction of Shanghai City. Because of this, the future construction of the urban area is waiting for the joint efforts of the citizens. It is gratifying to us that most of the construction in the urban area last year tended to be in the area around the central urban area, and at the same time, the junction between the western end of the Greater West District of the Public Concession (actually, there are no boundaries, but according to the current security administration), has gradually become a beautiful residential area in the past two years. The construction of Zhabei is also very developed, which is a bright sign of future revival.</p>
