<p>時評</p>
<h3>新鹽法應從速施行</h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>五全大會第三次大會决議。請國府飭主管機關。於二十五年底分區施行新鹽法。查新鹽法早於民國二十年三月二十一日由立法院通過。五月三十日由國府明令公佈。內容共計七章三十九條。其要點爲（一）鹽就塲徵稅。任人民自由買賣。無論何人不得壟斷。藉以根本剷除專商引岸之積弊。（二）鹽非經政府許可。不得採製。用以調節鹽之產銷。使供求相應。（三）鹽分爲食鹽·漁鹽·及工農用鹽三種。並設置鹽質檢查員。檢騐食鹽之楚否合於標準。以重人民衛生。（四）鹽稅除工農用鹽免稅外。食鹽每一百公斤一律徵稅國幣五元。漁鹽每一百公斤一律徵稅國幣三角。概不得重徵或附加。以獎勵工農而减輕人民負擔。此外又規定新鹽法公佈後。應設置鹽政改革委員會。直隸行政院。以促新法之施行。此誠適合當今需要之法典也。</p>
<p>鹽爲我人日用必需之品。食鹽徵稅之不合租稅原則。凡稍具常識者類能道之。先進國家因國庫支絀而暫以鹽稅爲挹注者。固不乏其例。而根本取消者實居多數。我國以鹽稅爲國家稅收大宗。作外債之擔保。本屬稅制上之一大缺點。而所謂引岸·專商·官運·商運·官鹽·私鹽等等。更五花八門。名目繁多。鹽商因得壟斷剝削。鹽民與食戶交受其困。前北京政府有鑒於此。屢圖改革。首擬廢除引岸制度。就塲徵稅。許人民自由買賣。但引岸制度爲鹽商利藪所在。自不願輕易放棄。於是藉其金錢勢力。多方運動。而改革案遂置高閣。民國十七年。第一次全國財政會議决議改革鹽政。以就塲徵稅。自由貿易爲原則。第一步從整理塲產。劃一鹽稅做起。十八年七月。立法院又根據二中全會整理鹽法之决議。咨行政院令財政部草擬新鹽法案。迅送立法院審議。翌年五月。立法院以財部延未起草。乃由院長指定委員。草訂鹽法。是年十二月。第一屆立法委員任期終了。工作中斷。第二屆立法委員就職後。繼續擬訂。至二十年三月。新鹽法始吿成立。</p>
<p>新鹽法頒布後。鹽商仍羣起反對。百計阻撓。致此有利於國計民生之良法。歷時四年有半。迄未見諸實施。在此期內。非惟一般民衆備受舊鹽制所造成之痛苦。各地鹽民且時因引岸制度之存在。而釀成越軌運動。本年九月浙江鹽民之吃大戶風潮。卽最近之例證。此誠不能令人無憾者。現五全大會有促政府實施新鹽法之决議。固爲我人所樂聞。而决議之見諸實行。更爲我人所切望者也。</p>

<h3>科學叢談</h3>
<p>— 中國科學社主編</p>
<p>心理的應用　蕭孝嶸</p>
<p>心理學和日常生活—心理學和敎育—心理</p>
<p>學和心理衛生——心理學和實業——心理</p>
<p>學和翳學—心理學和法律—心理學和軍事</p>
<p>我們研究心理學的目標，是在預測和控制人的行爲。在日常的生活中，預測行爲和控制行爲的事不一而足。例如人們喜歡在某個銀行存放欵項是因爲他們預測這個銀行是可靠的。和人合辦一種實業的事業必須立一合同。這就是要控制彼此的行爲，又如敎師要在每個星期內舉行小考一次。這就是要控制學生在每個星期中讀書的行爲。我們或者可以說，差不多大部分的行爲都含着預測和控制的意義在內，所以這種預測和控制行爲的興趣不但是自然產生的而且是不可缺少的。心理學的目標就是要使我們了解行爲的因果關係以便在預測或控制行爲時更有把握。</p>
<p>心理學和日常的生活的關係最多。一般的人們在做事的時候只要能够敷衍過去，便自己認爲滿意；因此他們的能力不能發展到充分的程度。也有許多人很想在含有技巧的活動中受有充分的訓練而不能達到這種目的。還有許多人就是在應用語言的能力上總求其完善而無法使之完善。還有許多日常的工作在時間和精力上也有許多不必要的耗費。凡此一切的問題都需要心理學的知識和原則來解決。</p>
<p>心理學在敎育方面的應用已經爲人所公認。心智的發展不但是爲遺傳的因素所支配，而且爲環境的因素所支配。我們必須如何建設一種環境才能使兒童在心智方面有最適當的發展？這當然是敎育上的開題，但在基本上却是心理學上的問題。我們必須在心理學方面有了充分的知議，才能决定兒童應當如何發展，敎育應當如何適應兒童的需要和敎育應當如何影饗兒童的將來。</p>
<p>心理學和心理衛生（Mental　Hygiene）的關係亦很重要。人的人格容易感受腐化的影饗。一個健全的人格是靠着好惡得其均衡，自然的衝動能有滴當的滿足，社會和經濟的價値能有正確的認識。心理學對於人格的修養可有許多貢獻。它在這方面的應用就是所謂「心理衛生」。</p>
<p>心理學在實業方面的應用在歐美各國已有相當的進展，而尤以在德俄二國爲最發達。就工廠方面說，有許多絕大的浪費是由於管理人員不以工作情境去適應工人而勉强工人去適應工作悄境，或由於濫用工人不擇良莠所致。倘若應用實業心理學的方法，這些浪費便可以减少許多。貨物的銷路不單止靠着貨品的優良，而且靠着推鉗人員和顧客接洽的方式。推銷人員如果在應用心理方面有充分的知識便知道如何和顧主接洽才能生效。廣吿也是一種推銷的方法。廣吿裏面便須應用許多心理學的原則，例如材料的排列，題目的選擇和圖畫的描寫都包含心理學的問題在內。</p>
<p>人性的控制在醫生方向也是很重要的。從前以爲醫生的職責只是看病開方，但是這種謬誤的觀念久已改變。醫生所處置的材料不能說完全是一種化學的化合物，須由藥物去變化的；他的病人多半需要一種適宜的病房空氣。在這種空氣中以醫生自信的態度爲最重要。有許多病人只在有相當的信仰時才能服藥生效，而且有些病人所需要的只是情緒習慣的改變而不是藥物。此數點都可以表明心理學和醫學的關係。</p>
<p>裁判的人員必須知道犯罪的心理和證據的心理才能减少他們的錯誤。律師必須和他的訴訟人，裁判官，陪審員相接觸。所以他必須常常觀察他們的特性。當他在裁判官面前向陪審員說話的時候，和訊問證人的時候必須極力影響他們的態度。他的成敗就是看他所發生的影饗而定。由此可見心理學在法律上的重要性。</p>
<p>在軍事方面心理學也能有重要的貢獻。例如「將兵」「將將」便是心理控制的問題。軍人選擇和軍事訓練包含預測和控制的問題在內。古人所謂「先人有奪人之心」「一鼓作氣，再而衰，三而竭」，等等的話都早已認識了心理原則在軍事方面的重要性。軍事心理學早有長足的發展。這種心理。是我國現在所亟須應用的。</p>

<h3>美亦制止原料　接濟交戰國家　貨船仍被阻不得開航</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）美政府現巳作制止原料接濟交戰國之重要行動、航務局函致各輪船公司、吿以裝運原料前往交戰國、實與政府政策牴觸云、航務局雖未作停化津貼之恐嚇、但聞對於出租船隻裝貨與交戰國貿易之船主、將予以相當之處分、按航務局此函殆因現有貨船數艘滿載原料擬往戰區一事而發、（二十二日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）內政部長兼油業專員伊克斯要求油商終止以油類售與交戰國、及國務總理赫爾昨日所稱僅有政客及受關稅保護之特權階級反對美加互惠貿易協定、已完全闡明政府之政策、該政策可歸納如下、（一）勸止美國商人與交戰國貿易、藉此遏止戰事、（二）維持和平國家之友誼、並以實際方法鼓勵貿易、例如全世界一致减低人造之貿易障碍、赫爾又稱、時勢强迫美國恢復國外市塲、否則國家務須放棄出售其剩餘貨物之思想云、（二十二日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）據消息靈通人士所知、政府對於各航業公司凡領有聯邦航政局津貼者、將施以壓力、俾勿運送貨物、前往意阿兩交戰國、並聞現有媒油船多艘、當由紐奧亮斯港、駛往意國、頃已展期啟程云、按各該公司所置貨船、曾向政府抵押欵項、政府祇須拒絕轉期、卽可令其就範、（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（紐約）全國主要火油公司之代表今日不願討論對意貿易、但咸覺內政部長伊克斯要求各公司終止以媒油運往意國爲無理、並妨礙彼等之利益、據稱實施對意制裁、係由英國所發起、但英國公司現仍以煤油售與意國云、（二十二日國民電）</p>
<p>桑彼得羅　貨船鄂來貢號不理國務　理赫爾之警吿、今日裝載飛機油三萬六千桶開往意屬索瑪里倫、該船水手皆不隸屬工會、雖該船允加給工資百分之五十、但工會中人不願上船服務、該船因此在洛杉磯延擱約一星期、海員工會領袖曾電吿國　總理、非至國務院擔保船員之完全保護後、工會中人不願隨船開往意屬索瑪里倫、但國務院接此電後、並未對於此事有何批評也（二十二日路透電）</p>
<h3>意國不參加　國聯兩種會議　表示抵抗制裁之决心</h3>

<p>（羅馬）此間非正式方面估計、意國儲有充份汽油、足敷前敵六月之用、六月以後、意國可望結束東菲戰事、關於美國內政部長伊克斯發表之警吿、官方今日保守緘默、惟對於美國立塲至感煩慮、觀察者今日咸信華盛頓制止煤油運往意國如告成功、則意國擬將美國列入經濟報復計劃以內云、（二十二日國民竄）</p>

<h3>財部實施之新貨幣制度　財政部賦稅司長高秉坊　（十一月十七日對全國中學生及民衆講）</h3>
<p>近年世界各國爲着經濟恐慌，各重要國家都採用管理貨幣制度，將流通　硬幣，由國家銀行集中保管，國內只許流通紙幣，以謀控制匯兌，安定物價，這柿制度所收效果，頗爲顯著。</p>
<p>我國貨幣向來以銀爲本位，自在國外提高銀價以後，我國的銀幣受了白銀價格劇烈變動的影饗，流出很多，就去年七月至十月中句這三個半月的統計，出口銀幣的數額，竟至二萬萬元以上，這是多麼的驚人啊。</p>
<p>因爲銀幣流出過多的緣故，通貨突然緊縮，就釀成物價下落，百業蕭條，許多工業有陷於破產的現象，當時政府雖採取緊急處置，於　年十月十五日起，施行徵收銀出口稅，兼課平衡稅，以防止白銀的外溢，可是只能制止一時，究竟不是根本的辦法，而國內外銀價和差過鉅，偷運銀幣出口，希圖牟利的仍時有所聞，各界人十紛紛請求政府，設法挽救危機，政府外應世界的趨勢，內察國內的實悄，知道要努力自救，復興經濟，必須保存國家命脈所繫的通貨準備金，才可以謀貨幣金融永久的安定，當參酌現代各國的先例，即於本月三日以緊急處置而公布行使法幣，統一發行，集中準備的　法六項。這六項辦法是（一）自本年十一月四日起，以中央中國交通三銀行所發之鈔票，定爲法幣，所有完糧納稅，及一切公私欵項之收付，概以法幣爲限，不得行使現金，違者全數沒收，以防白銀之偷漏，如有故存隱匿，意圖偷漏者，應准照危害民團緊急治罪法處治。（二）中央中國交通三銀行以外，曾經財政部核准發行之銀行鈔票，現在流通者，准其照常行使，其發行數額以截至十一月三日止流通之總額爲限不得增發，由財政部酌定限期，逐漸以中央鈔票換回，並將流通總額之法定準備金速同已印未發之新鈔，及已發收回之舊鈔，悉數交由發行準備管理委員會保管，其核准印製中之新鈔，並俟印就時，一併照交保管。（三）法幣準備金之保管及其發行牧換專宜，設發行準備管理委員會辦理，以昭確實而固信用，其委員會章程另案公布。（四）凡銀錢行號商店及其他公私機關或個人，持有銀本位幣或其他銀幣生銀等銀類者應自十一月四日起交由發行準備瞥理委員會，或其指定之銀行，兌換法幣，除銀本位幣按照面額兌換法幣外，其餘銀類，各依其實含純銀數量兌換。（五）舊有以銀幣單位訂立之契約應各照原定數額，於到期日概以法幣結算收付之。（六）爲使法幣對外匯價按照目前價格穩定起見，應由中央中國交通三銀行，無限制買賣外匯。</p>
<p>政府所以毅然决然實行這種新制度，目爲着自救起見，因爲實行這種新制度之後，可以復興經濟，安定金融，確立幣制基礎，我們可以分開來講。</p>
<p>第一，是復與經濟，我國近年以來，農村經濟破產，工商極度的凋敝，都因爲通貨緊縮物價下落的緣故，實行新制度之後，準備集中，旣可以杜絕銀幣的偷漏，消滅通貨緊縮的根本原因，又以統一發行，使鈔票流通的效力，益加敏活，間接可以增加流通的數量，同時農工商業營運資金的需要，也就容易獲得，物價亦可合理的向上，而農工商業亦可以逐漸蘇醒過來。</p>
<p>第二，是安定金融，通貨緊縮的影響首當其衝的是金融，這一年半以來，金融不安定的狀態，巳足顯表示，他方面因爲外滙價格起落不常，更足以加重金融的不安定。這種新制度實行以後通貨既不致繼續緊縮，並且可寬舒過來國內金融自可日臻安定，對於外匯，明定由中央中國交通三銀行，負資爲無限制的買賣，價格也就穩定，不致有過度的漲落更可以加强金融安定的稈度。</p>
<p>第三，是確立幣制基礎，我國發行鈔票的銀行，中央中國交通三行之外，還有其他銀行，這種多數發行制度，政府雖十二分的嚴防監督，究不免有墨一漏萬的地方，尤其是各行各自為政，發行數量的增减，和金融李節的需要往往適得其反，不足爲近代發展農產的帮助就是人民對於鈔票的行使，其信任也常不及硬幣。實行新制度之後明白規定中央中國交通三銀行的鈔票爲法幣。此外的銀行不得續有增發，巳發行的鈔票，限期逐漸用法幣收回又設了發行準備管理委員會，管理發行準備，公開檢查，發行既已統一，一方面有確實的準備，一方面因爲集中管理的緣故，發行數量的增减，也可適應農業的需要，同時管理委員會委員的人選，多半是人民代表，按期檢查更可增加鈔票的信用而確立了幣制的基礎，上面所述的三點，都是實行新制度的利益。</p>
<p>在這裏頭要聲明的，就是此種新制度並非通貨膨脹，亦非紙幣政策，因爲通貨膨脹，是以加速度的發行，或减低鈔票的現金準備成分，或减低貨幣所含量色，以達到其目的，我們的新制度，仍保守以前的準備制度，並沒有絲毫變更，而且公開管理，發行多少鈔票，就有多少準備金，所以說不是通貨膨脹。</p>
<p>何以說不是紙幣政策呢，我們法幣的準備，仍舊是銀本位幣，他的價値和銀本位幣無異，不過以前的準備，由發行銀行自行管理，現在是由發行準備　　委員會集中管理，其本質毫無區別，其信用更可加增，所以不是紙幣政策。</p>
<p>至於我國版圖遼闊，內地以及邊遠的地方，中央中國交通三銀行的分支打，還沒有普遍設立，目前對於兌換法幣一事，誠不免梢感困難，關於這層，政府亦早見到，業已通電各省市，凡無法兌換法幣的地方，暫准保持原來市面習慣，並由三銀行委託各地行莊，典當，郵政，鐵路，輪船各局，各地稅收機關，各縣政府，各公共機關，各公共團體，代爲收換法幣，而郵局因爲設立普遍的緣故，代爲收兌法幣，更予人民不少便利，並爲對一兌換辦法，及便利銀製品製造者用銀起見，又規定兌換法幣規則及銀製品用銀管理規則，分別公布施行。</p>
<p>這種新制度，在我國實爲空前的創舉，也是經濟史上重大的改革，民衆對此，初時不免懷疑，投機分子因此利用機會，以致物價驟見抬高，鈔票換價亦稍低落，現在經各地官應及銀錢業公會商會的遵照政府的意旨，明白解釋，人心大安，市面亦恢復常態，關於這類的消息，報紙日有記載，不待詳述。</p>
<p>尤其値得欣慰的，我們的新制度實行以後，英大使即通令英商遵從，將現銀照兌法幣，英美輿論且異口同聲的贊成我國此舉，各國均有此種傾向，足見政府此種新制度，巳得中外一致贊助。</p>
<p>從此以後，政府自當脚踏實地，穩便的進行，一面仍希望全國民衆始終恊助，使政府得竟全功，那是國家所利賴的。（完）</p>

<h3>孔財長注意鄉村社會生計計劃籌設縣鄉銀行　完成吾國之地方銀行制度　發展生產事業求自力更生　溝通都　市與鄉村金融力量</h3>
<p>新聲社云、自實行法幣消息公布後、對於如何行使法幣於鄉村社會、南北輿論界有詢問者、有質疑者、近據確息、財政部長孔祥熙氏、對鄉村社會生計極爲關懷、不僅從事消極救濟、且有積極建設計劃對於經濟凋敝之遠因近因、有深切之認識與評述、略以吾國自通商以來、我則以量大價小之原料輸出、人則以量小價大之製品輸入、此項輸出入貿易之結果、耗損之鉅、未能以數目字統計、近年來因白銀價格之急劇變動、菩國原料輸出、貿易頓形阻滯、而外貨狂賤、大量傾銷輸入、超過與年俱　、造成吾國空前未有之嚴重現象、尤其甚者、白銀流出、日有所聞、不特銀條銀塊之流出、有不竭不止之趨勢、卽吾國已鑄成之銀幣、亦發現被人偷運銷熔牟利之事實、茲爲採用近代各國保存硬幣於國庫行使鈔券於市而之原則、並爲保持吾國之經濟力量起見、公布實行法幣收回硬幣之通吿、幸獲友邦同悄、一致行使、於是分對外對內兩方面設計之、</p>
<p>（一）對外方面　國外貿易、由中央中交三銀行、負承辦國際匯兌收發之責任、現在輸入貿易、雖然超過輸出、而匯兌行情、務期有精切之計算、正當之淸付、詳釋之統計、貿易入超者、當然匯兌行情爲逆的狀態、貿易出超者、當然匯兌行情爲順的狀態、現代後進國家、莫不期其生產事業之發達、莫不期其由入超貿易而漸漸轉到出超貿易、由逆的匯兌行情而漸漸轉到順的匯兌行情、此中盈虛倚伏之運用、概由國家自己操持之轉換之、爲唯一之法門、否則斷無成功之希望、此次實行法幣、卽爲吾國權衡貿易之適當辦法、</p>
<p>（二）對內方面　近代各國、以政治力量促成經濟之發展、要以實施金融政策爲入手辦法、而金融政策之基幹、是否確立、應先察看銀行制度已否完成爲憑斷、現在吾國關於中央銀行制度、業已完成、惟關於地方銀行制度、尙係缺陷、最近計劃設立之中國縣鄉銀行、卽爲完成吾國之地方銀行制度、茲將要點述之、（一）中國縣鄉銀行、爲發展國民生產事業之總推動機關、爲溝通都市金融力量與鄉村金融力量之總樞紐、（二）縣地方情况各異、而需要亦各不相同、如某縣宜於農業者、當然以扶助農業爲主旨、如宜於工商業及其他特種事業者、當然以扶助其他事業爲主旨、定名日中國縣鄕銀行者、爲投資之易於轉化起見、爲其特點、（三）中國縣鄉銀行總行資本、由中央政府撥給之、分行資本、以舊道屬所屬縣份爲一分行單位、由各縣政府與人民籌集之、至各縣鄉視察情形、得設立辦事處不另集資、又總行管轄分行、而分行管轄辦事處、倘甲縣生產事業、係人民日常生活所需、惟一時周轉不靈、而乙縣無力挹注之丙縣生產事業、一時周轉不靈、而丁縣無力抱注之、當此之時、應由總行維持之、如總行無力時、呈請中央政府核准由中央各銀行貸欵縣鄉銀行總行間接維持之、於是國民生產事業、不但不致倒閉、且能正當發達、兼程併進、將國家置於富强地步、可操必勝之券、總之、中國縣鄕銀行、由政府與人民合資組織、造成中央政府與地方政府政治力量之合作實施、卽能發揮促進國民經濟發達之偉大效用、此之謂設立中國縣銀行、卽爲發展國民生產事業自力更生之經濟政策、據聞　斯、敬代國民翹盼早日見諸實行、國家幸甚、地方幸甚、</p>

<p>已派駁船卸貨</p>
<p>法租界興業里九號安泰輪船公司托民新公司代理之長泰輪、於本日、自陳家港開出、滿長裝食鹽、駛往岳州城陵磯交卸、十九日上午八時過吳淞口、昨日船到漢口附近、約有二十八哩、卽可到達乃因領港誤駛航道、致將該輪開到淺灘遂遭擱淺、</p>
<p>擱淺時情形　該輪船主名注亞夫、僱有領江兩名、引水前進、昨日上午三時、該輪開到Huquang躉船地方突然錯駛航路、船身驟在該處江面擱淺、當因滿船裝鹽、吃水甚深、擱淺後、船主曾力求自謀脫險、終以陷擱太深雖打倒車、仍未能移動分毫、</p>
<p>電請派駁船　船主以無法可施、乃急發電來滬代理行民新輪船公司略稱、長泰輸於本月二十三日上午三時、在Huquang躉船處擱淺、一時無法脫出、而船內滿載食鹽請卽設法、派遣駁船前往、將該輪內鹽斤、先行起卸、使載量减輕、然後冉謀拖救云云、民新公司已將此電、轉交中國船舶保險聯合會矣、現在民新輪船公司已經電　、就沂雇派駁船前往、先將各艙食鹽　設法駁去、蓋食鹽在船不能久遲、因其損失較大也、</p>

<h3>李景樅談　我國民用航空最近之概況</h3>
<p>中央社云、記者因我國民用航空之舉辦、巳有四五年之經過、所有一般民衆、對於利用之情形、及經營者辦理之成績、是否均能與歐美各國並駕齊驅、極爲一般留心航空事業者所亟欲知悉、特往訪歐亞航空公司總經理李景樅氏、向之查詢、承其詳細答復如下、</p>
<p>（甲）關於一般民衆利用之情形者</p>
<p>我國近數年來、足供民衆利用之航空機關、共有三個、一爲歐亞航空公司、一爲中國航空公司、一爲西南航空公司、此三公司之航綫、總長約共三萬華里、航站總數約爲四十餘所、內中除中國航空公司及西南航空公司之郵運載客、輸貨之統計數目、因本人一時不能憶及、恕不奉吿外、茲僅就一般民衆對於利用歐亞航空公司之情形、略述如下、歐亞航空公司之航綫、總長約一萬五千華里、航站共十七所、現除蘭州至塔城一段、計長四千四五白華里、共有航站四所、一時因受新疆政冶影響、暫吿停航外、其餘如由上海·經南京·鄭州·西安。至蘭州·之航綫、共長三千七白餘華里、祇須於淸早六時半、由上海起飛、下午四時半、即巳飛抵蘭州、其由上海經南京·鄭州西安·漢中·至成都·之航綫則長三千八百餘華里亦僅於淸早六時、由上海起飛、下午五時、即可到達成都、他如由上海至寗夏·包頭·等處、亦只隔宿即可到達、以視由上海至蘭州及由上海至成都之路程、如改用其他交通器其、如火車·輪船·汽車·等、則至少非十餘日不能到達，以此較比，奚啻天壤，此利用航空之客貨郵統計上所示吾人之數字、所以日增月益、計歐亞航空公司第一第二年度所載乘客、爲九四一人、郵件爲五七七公斤、貨物爲四一五一公斤、第三年度所載之乘客、爲六五二人、郵件爲二八五七公斤、貨物爲一六三九一公斤、第四年度所載之乘客、爲一零七四人、郵件爲四一六九公斤、貨物爲四三零九二公斤、第五年度所載之乘客爲二一一〇公斤、郵件爲八七九六公斤、貨物爲五八八八一公斤、本年度最近四個月所載之乘客、爲零一五公斤、郵件爲二八四五公斤、貨物爲二八八七八公斤、且巳超過第一二三年度全年度及四五年度半年度載運之成績、於此可見一般、民衆利用航空之踴躍、蓋般民衆遇有緊急之商務函件、或急欲與親屬通訊、如利用航空寄遞旣不較利用電報爲遲慢、且能詳盡、而又廉價、益以郵局人員附於航空信件之處理、更較普通快信爲特別迅速、故最近航空郵件數量之激增、直　蒸蒸日上之勢、即貨物包裹等、亦莫不皆然、至於乘客、則最近數月來、除班期已予增加外·爲應需求起見，有時目須屢屢增開特班飛行、此民衆和用航空之大略情形也、</p>
<p>（乙）關於經營者辦理之成績者</p>
<p>亦擬僅就歐亞航空公司之範圍略述如次、</p>
<p>一·飛機設備　歐亞航空公司最初均係採用榮格賜全金屬低翼之單發動機飛機、因該種飛機、依統計上所得之證明、即遇有失事、亦絕不易傷及乘客、最近歐亞航空公司爲求益爲安全起見、更進一步四採用榮格賜全金屬低翼之三發動機飛機蓋此三發動機、每個均具有六百五十匹馬力、即使就中之一個發生障礙、對於飛行、仍不發生若何影響、而得安全間目的地繼續前進、至於機艙內部、則每一乘客之座位、不特備極舒適、毫不擁擠、且有吸烟室、及盥吸室之設、而在飛行之際於隔窗瀏覽風景之外、並有精美茶點之供給、此外如駕駛室內所備之無綫電報收發機、亦可供乘客電約親友、在中涂經停之航站候晤、或在到達站迎接之用、</p>
<p>二·盲目飛行設備　盲目飛行儀器、爲定期飛行不可少之設備、蓋全年三百六十五日、旣不能必其均係犬朗氣淸、則遇有低雲四佈、爲使班期亦不至胥受影響、勢非準備與惡劣氣候抵抗不可、抗抵之工具、惟有賴於盲日飛行之　器、盲目飛行儀器、乃用以在雲中飛行、四無目標之種儀器、雲中飛行、在歐亞航空公司、幾成為每次飛行必不可免之事實、蓋由西安至蘭州所經之六盤山及由西安至成都之秦嶺。幾於無時無刻不是被雲封蔽、般之無此種盲目飛行設備遇有此種情形、非繞沿山谷飛行、即根本不敢前進、歐亞航空公司　設有此種儀器、故　此種悄形之下、祇　　飛機向上昇騰、直入雲中、迨至飛出山尖之高空、即可安然在被雲　蔽之高山上、逕向目的地飛行、而不虞有其他、</p>
<p>三·定向器設備　旣有盲目飛行之設備、如無定向器爲之審定飛行方向、終亦無裨於定期飛行蓋飛機飛人雲中、固能倚賴盲目飛行之儀器、從容操縱、而其眞確之方向、則須憑藉定向器之用無綫電通報方法、將飛行之方向、吿知駕駛員、而協助其向員的航站飛行、歐亞航空公司飛機、因備有此種定向器、故目的站雖被低雲　蔽而終亦無礙其到達、</p>
<p>四·無綫電設備　歐亞航空公司爲防飛　萬一出事、氣候之突如劇變、俾航站與飛機間能有機會互相通知、以便營救或趨避起見、無論飛機及沿綫各站、均設有長波無綫電收發機、並規定在飛機飛行時間內最近之前後兩站電臺、均須與飛機作不斷之通訊、藉策安全、同時爲免航站與航站或總公司間之業務通訊、須受航站與飛機間之安全通訊之影饗復於各航站間、併設短波無綫電臺、以便長波專供與飛機通訊、而短波則供航站與航站或總公司之通訊、</p>
<p>五·航站設備　歐亞航空公司因所經營之航綫、多在西北邊遠之區、起居飲食、均極不便、且甚惡劣、爲謀航空乘客之能少得舒適起見、除在沿綫各站均自健有航站房屋、以資招待休息外、復在西安·蘭州·肅州·等處、特建寬敞之房屋、及備淸潔之飲食、以供乘客食住之　、實較之就地覓居旅館爲仲多多也、</p>
<p>六·京滬間之夜間飛行　歐亞航空公司為謀喚起民衆對於飛行事業之更感興趣起見、除於飛機上及機塲上裝設探射燈及其他夜間　行之必要設備外、並利用其巳有之盲目飛行·定向器·及無綫電等之完善設備、舉辦京滬問之夜間飛行、俾一班航空乘客、能於夜色憧憧之天空、俯覽萬家燈火之勝景、而又不至發生危險、計自開辦以來、約有兩月、幾於無次不吿客滿、旣打破歐亞航空公司載客之新紀錄、亦實爲亞洲有航空事業以來之創舉、</p>
<p>七·國籍技術人員之養成　歐亞航空公司、於從車航空事業之經營外、並努力於國籍技術人員之養成、其所招取訓練之人員·均係曾在國內外機械學校·或高中以上學校、或航空專鬥學校·之畢業生、現在業已訓練成功分散沿綫各航站及北平南苑本埠龍華之修理廠服務者、約有四十餘人之多、而派往德國益求深造者亦有十二人、最近並復分函各工業大學、請其介紹品學優良之畢業生、從事於繼續訓練、其在飛機上、純粹由國籍飛行人員擔任飛行者、巳有四人、擔任隨機機械電信工作者、亦有六人、此項國籍飛行人員、及隨機機械電信員、且均經受有盲目飛行之訓練、在技術上、較之德籍飛行人員、及隨機機械電信員、實毫無遜色、再假以時日、其養成之成績、當更可觀也、</p>
<p>航行安全與班期準確　以上七點、僅係略舉歐亞航空公司辦理成績之犖犖較大者、他如中國航空公司、西南航空公司、諒亦必有相當之貢獻、歐亞舫空公司惟其對於　舉各點之特別愼重將事、故自民國二十年開辦迄今、從未聞有因飛機失愼而危及乘客者、亦從未見有因暴風雨低雲微霧之障碍、而須停止飛行者、其飛行之安全、班期之準確、實不僅在亞洲、即較之歐美航空發展之國家、亦絕不遜色、</p>
<p>吾人之希望　菩國幅員廣大、山嶺崎嶇、輪船旣不能隨處　達、而鐵道公路之修築、亦費欵需時、惟有航空設施較爲容易、需欵較少、倘一般民衆、對於航空交通之認識、更能與時俱進、盡量利用、及航空經營者、亦能努力加鞭迎頭趕去、則飛行事業之發展、或將駕歐美而上之、而成爲一種極普遍之生活現象、蓋在我國目前欲求舒適與迅速之交通、實舍航空莫山、尙憶當開始發明火車之時、一般民衆、對於乘坐、極存戒心、然至今日、凡有火車之處、絕更無人肯坐騾車及轎馬、然則照此現狀觀之、飛機之在中國、再過數年、豈不將與火車汽車輪船之成爲同等普遍之旅行利器、所不相同者、即一則須以月日計程、一則祇以若干小時若干分鐘計程耳、</p>

<p>「我爲你照管他們罷，只要你告訴我怎樣辦法，他們儘可住在我的烏龜槽裏」。小橋說道，他覺得他們比他的幾個踱方步的烏龜朋友來得更有趣。因此唐恩吿訴他　的需要和脾氣，於是小橋帶他們去了，預備領他們去住他們的新居，並介紹給他們的鄰人一他是多麼一個好孩子」！唐恩說道，一壁在仔細料理好那隻蝴蝶，忽又記得小橋今日是犧牲了他步行的樂趣把那隻蝴蝶送回來的。</p>

<h3>怎樣救濟災區的兒童？</h3>
<p>— 波光</p>
<p>今年我國的水災區域，遍及數省，一般民衆受了這樣重大的苦難，眞是不幸！光陰一天天的很快過去，又到了初冬的季節，許多無家可歸；無食果腹的災民，啼飢號寒，是何等的苦惱？尤其是一般天眞爛漫的兒童。</p>
<p>前天我們四安地方，舉行兒童演講競賽，講題是「怎樣救濟災區的兒童？」各位小朋友都有很好意見發揮，把它歸納起來，不外乎兩點，現在把它寫在下面，希望全國的小朋友都起來實行。</p>
<p>第一點：省下糖菓錢救災這是最好的意思，因爲小孩子除了三餐飯以外，什麼都不吃爲妙，多吃糖菓，又易損齒，並阻礙消化器能，把這些錢省下來救濟災區小朋友，這眞是利人利己。</p>
<p>第二點；向家長戚友勸募棉衣節候一天冷似一天了，它們的身上禦寒品，也是不可或缺的，一個人受凍是很難過的。向家長戚友勸募棉衣。是最切效的工作，還得趕快實行！</p>
<h3>菲律賓第一任大總統奎松</h3>
<p>— 兼應</p>
<p>小朋友，菲律賓自今年十一月十五日起，正式宣布獨立，成立自洽政府了，這自治政府的第一任大總統是誰呢？就是曾經到過我們上海的前任菲律賓上議院議長奎松</p>
<p>曼愛爾，奎松今年五十八歲。在一八九八年的時候，他是一個阿銀挪多部下的靑年下級軍官，那時候菲律賓的人民正在西班牙統治之下掀起了大革命的戰爭，他極力在戰爭中把西班牙的軍隊打退。隨後菲律賓的統治權不幸又落在美帝國主義之手，沒有正式獨立起來，他鬱鬱不樂，靜靜地住在自己的家中。一直到了二十世紀開始的一年，他的同學賽爾基。奧斯曼創辦了一種日報，鼓吹獨立，他再度出來，協助奧斯曼辦報。後來又在一九〇六年和奧斯曼合作，組織「立卽獨立黨」，第二年，「立卽獨立黨」和「聯合國民黨」合併，改做「菲律賓國民黨」，奧斯曼做了黨的領袖，奎松卻鬱鬰不　志，後來這「國民黨」就成了菲律賓最大的政煎。奧斯曼也就做菲律賓議會的議長，一直做了十多年。</p>
<p>一九一二年，奎松被議會派任駐美專員，他就極力在美國奔走獨立運動。終於得了美國國會的通過，允許菲律賓在十年後正式獨立，成立自治政府。這次的成功，　奎松在菲律賓的地位突然提高起來。一直到他戰勝了他們的黨魁奧斯曼。</p>
<p>到一九一六年十一月，奎松辭去了駐美代表職，就任菲律賓參議院長。他也就和奧斯曼分成了兩派：一派是獨立民主黨，以奧斯曼爲領袖，一派是國民民主黨，奎松自己做了領袖。</p>
<p>今年九月，菲律賓正式選舉大總統，因爲老革命家彁銀挪多也出來競選，奎松因恐不敵，所以又和奧斯曼聯合起來，以增　自己的勢力。結果，　居然被選爲第一任大總統了。奧斯曼也被選爲第一任副總統。</p>
<p>現在，菲律賓自治政府已經正式成立，美國派了副總統和陸軍部長來參加。自今年十一月十五日起，奎松就開始過他的總統生活了。以前總督住的瑪拉加南宮，以後也換了奎松做主人，正和羅斯福做美國白宮的主人一樣呢。</p>

<h3>灰塵</h3>
<p>— 眞</p>
<p>敏兒近來心中是充滿着愉快的戚覺，因爲　所希望要的東西，都實現了。什麼自來水筆哪，書籍哪，而最近他爸爸給他一輛脚踏車，使他心裏更有一種說不出的快樂，因爲他已經想了好多日子哩。</p>
<p>當他的爸爸給他這一輛脚踏車後，他是很當心着，不住的去瞧瞧它，有沒有他的弟妹在玩弄？又時常拿了柔軟的布輕輕的去揩拭着恐怕它要生銹哩。</p>
<p>在每天的早晨，他一起了身，便去望望他心愛的東西—脚踏車，那知道它上面有很多的灰塵，於是他很快的把它揩去了。心裏想道：</p>
<p>「可恨的灰塵，你爲什麼徧要把我歡喜的東西弄髒。它到底從那兒來的？」</p>
<p>「哥哥，灰塵是很討厭的，它從那裏來的？」</p>
<p>「在熱鬧繁華的都市和工廠林立的地方，不用說是從烟囪裏來的，但是在人烟稀少的郊野　灰塵是那兒來的呢。我們一想當然是被風從都市中帶來的。這種說法也不算錯，不過它根本的來源也不是這樣的。我們要知道除烟囪外，火山也會噴出灰塵來，空氣和風雨所侵蝕的石頭也會製造灰塵，而製造灰塵的大本營，還要算是隕石，就是我們所說的「星搬塲。」我們不要恨灰塵，它也有它的用處。」</p>
<p>「怎麼隕石是製造灰塵的大本營？它有什麼用處？一</p>
<p>「天文家吿訴我們：天空中每天有無數的隕石，向地球飛來，受到空氣的摩據而燃燒。所以空氣中由隕石燃燒而生的灰塵，分量一定不少。你知道天上落下來的雨滴，裏面是有灰塵的，倘然天空中沒有灰塵你試想那裏有一滴一滴的雨，一定是整塊的打下，那時我們在地球上的一切生物，受的害處就不少了」</p>
<p>「空氣中灰塵的總量有多少？」</p>
<p>「這太渺茫了。不過我看見過，有一個小小的統計：本世紀初，北非洲發生颶風，據說有一百萬噸以上的灰產吹到歐洲去，把全歐洲都散佈到。有些能飛下去二千五百英里。又有飛落在非洲海岸的，據近年計算約有一萬五千萬噸」</p>

<p>— 南洋第一附小六年級生方齊</p>
<p>本月九十兩日，我們受了敎練的吩咐，到外面去爲災民募捐。我被派爲小隊長，這因爲平時先生們都稱讚我勇敢有爲的緣故。我們一小隊共六個人，早晨七時就出發了：起先，我們都很怕難爲情，等到捐了好幾下後，膽子會漸漸地大起來，一點也不怕羞了。逢到了人，總是先生呀叔叔呀伯伯呀太太呀的叫着，好像叫化子在求乞一般，假使不募到我們也不肯放手。</p>
<p>我們向人家募捐，很是客氣，先行一個禮，然後向他說明災區的情形和徵募的理由，捐錢的多少，是由捐助人自己願意，我們並不硬要的。</p>
<p>至於募捐的目標，以行人居多數，沿路在商舖，弄坊，住宅，戲院門口等都捐過。有好多的人很能慷慨的解囊，然而不肯捐助的也碰到不少，雖然，有一部分人實在是捐不起的。</p>
<p>我們募捐的成續還算不差，因爲人太小了，總是吃虧的多便宜的少呀！</p>
<p>中膳是每人吃一碗麵，大槪是口也有些乾，腿也有些酸的緣故罷；吃麵時覺得格外有味道。這兩天，回到學校裏來的時候，巳經是萬家燈火了。</p>

<h3>關於「兒童科學講座」</h3>
<p>— 林蔭</p>
<p>我在本刋上担任寫「兒童科學講座」的稿子，已經有一年多了。承蒙許多讀者的愛護，鼓勵，謬贊。又從寫這稿，而有許多讀者寫信來願意和我做朋友，如乾綽，恒久，宗文，世俊……我一方面感激，一方面却戚覺得慚愧。這樣淺薄的東西，却値得讀者這樣的注意。同時我却不得不益加奮勉，以答讀者的盛情。所以雖然因爲事忙的關係。中止了寫稿近兩月之久，而現在又從百忙中來担任這個工作。並且我想把今後的計劃，來和讀者商榷一下。　過去，五六十篇的科學談話，差不多全是偏重於自然方面的，在那時，我寫作的目標有兩點，一方面滴合於時令，一方面和敎科書上的敎材相聯絡。可是，今後呢？我將改變另一個目標了。我深深地感覺，國家的災患，一天比一天嚴重，社會的工作，一天比一天緊張。中山先生說過：「天下事，自當天下的人民共同負責的！」見童是未來社會的負責人，在目前，急需要了解一切的社會關係，使其逐漸能接近社會活動，訓練成將來社會中一個有堅强意志，有活動經騐的人材。因此，見童科學講座的內容，除了自然科學外，要特別注意於「社會科學」常識的灌輸。第二，在體裁方面，我將改變過去機械講述的形式，而採用活潑的描寫和叙述，使兒童看了覺得格外有興趣，印象也能更深切。</p>
<p>至於稿件發表的時間，常有人要求規定每星期都發表，這不過因爲我的事忙關係，有的稿伴過分擁擠，無法决定，這是不得已的事，但總盡量安排，不使讀者過分的失望。</p>
<h3>世界萬花筒</h3>
<p>— 仁</p>
<p>什麼呌做「世界　花筒」？就是把整個的世界，當做一個　花筒。小朋友，你們口要望這「萬花筒」裏看，就可以一番一番的見到番番不同的花樣—每一個國家有它特別的國旗；特別的地形；特別的物產。特別的風俗；特別的建築。看啊！看啊！萬花簡變換起花樣來了！—看！一個黃衣國。</p>
<p>（一）一個黃衣國—暹遜</p>
<p>（一）暹　的國旗（二）暹　的象（三）邊的地形（四）暹　的女人（五）　　森林中的住宅（六）美麗的廟宇和皇宮（七）暹遲男子</p>
<p>黃衣國</p>
<p>世界上信　佛敎　虔誠的國家，要算是暹適了。在這一個國裏，沒有一個國民是不信　佛敎的。如果一個男子沒有做過和尙，那末他就失掉了做國民的資格。即使是國王，在他沒有登王位之前，也一定要做幾年和尙。全國有一萬六千五百多所的寺院，建築得都很偉大莊麗（圖六）。因爲有這種全國信佛的風俗，所以人家稱它爲黃衣國。</p>
<p>它的位置</p>
<p>暹邏在什麼地方呢？它在我國的南面，你們把世界地圖　出來看一看，就可以看到在印度支那半島的中部，有一個國家把一隻細長　脚伸到暹邏灣和馬達班灣的中間，這就是暹邏，它東與法屬印度支那接界；西和英屬緬甸做隣居；南部分和英屬馬來交界。（圖三）</p>
<p>象代車子</p>
<p>暹邏的家畜有牛馬象等。它的象更是　名。這些象，本來產於森林裏，成羣結隊地奔逐。暹選人卻有法子把它們捕來，養馴，使它們搬木材，耕田，非常得力，（圖二）</p>
<p>它的國旗</p>
<p>暹邏的國旗：上端和下端，各有一條紅條子，中間一條較闊的籃條子，嵌在兩倏白條子裏面（圖一）</p>
<p>它的人民</p>
<p>暹邏全國面積約有二十萬一百餘方哩，人口一千零三十萬人。我國華僑住在那里的約有六十萬。其實，三分之二的暹邏人，都可以說是我滿族的子孫，不過他們現在國際地位稍稍提高，便不肯承認是漢族後代罷了。（圖四和圖七）</p>
<p>它的物產</p>
<p>暹邏是在熱帶地方，天氣很然，西北境內遍地都是森林，暹邏人都在叢林裏蓋屋居住。（圖六）。木材一年出產五萬二千噸，米一年出產一百三十萬噸以上。小朋友，我國近年來農村破產，產米日少，我們每天吃的米，有時還　免是出了錢從暹邏買來的呢！</p>
<h3>白山烏的故事（十一）</h3>
<p>— 禧</p>
<p>我立刻放聲高唱起來，所最最使我滿意的就是賈克吐根聽了之後，旣不逃走，也並不睡熟。他定了眼睛對我看，又時時點頭，表示讚美的神情，又喃喃地似乎在說着誇獎我的話。但是不多一會，我却瞧到他並不在聽我的歌唱，而在夢想着他自己的那首詩。我乘這機會透了一口氣，他就帶着笑，搖着頭，很高興的對我說道「我巳找到了我那詩的韻律了！這是從我自己腦中，想出來的第六千七百十四個韻！它們還膽敢說我年老沒用，這是那裏來的話！我去讀給我的朋友們聽，看他們再說些什麼來！他這樣說着，撲翅飛了開去，一會兒巳不見了。</p>
<p>（五）</p>
<p>我孤零零的很是失望，唯一的辦法，只得利用這傍晚的時間，盡力地張開我的兩個翅膀，向着巴黎飛去。可是我很不幸的竟認不得路。因爲我一路上只是跟那鴿子飛着，所以那經過的路也一些兒記不起了。於是我不再向前飛去，向左轉了一個灣，飛到包伊德地方，而天色巳經黑下來，不得不在毛方頓森林中找一個歇宿的所在。</p>
<p>我達到森林中時，他們都巳睡了。那些人人所知道的喜鵲和　鳥，都是世界中最淘氣的東西，老是吵鬧個不休。在那矮樹叢中，有許多麻雀啾啾　　的亂呌，彼此踐踏着。在那水邊，有兩頭白鷺很壯嚴站着，好像想甚麼心事似的在耐心兒等候他們的妻子。有幾頭挺大的烏鴉，半醒半睡的棲止在最高的樹頂上，喃喃地做着晚禱。樹的下面，有那相親相愛的山雀仍還在彼此這逐着。同時有一頭啄木鳥，恨忙亂的從後面拉出伊的家屬來，推他們直到一個樹穴中去。一隊隊的籬省從田間飛回來，像一陣陣的煙霧般在空中飛舞着，飛到一株矮樹上，把樹身全都遮住了。磧　，鳴鳥，歐　們都散開在樹枝上，像燭台上一根根的水晶一樣。四周的爲聲，十令嘈雜，在那裏相喚着：「來啊，我的妻！來啊，我的女兒——我的美人兒，到我這邊來——在這裏，我的親愛的！—我的甜心，到這裏來吧！—晚安，我的愛人！—我的朋友們，明天會罷！—我的孩子們，願你們安睡！」</p>

<p>經濟往來</p>
<h3>最近世界經濟的好轉及其意義</h3>
<p>— 臨淸</p>
<p>一般說來，世界經濟在最近幾個月中，雖發生了許多政治的緊張和通貨的危機，但依然表現出了好轉的現象。無論是生產交易和就業人數，由全體看來，比較本年春季都有一些增加。例如柏林景氣研究所的世界工業指數（一九二八年等於一〇〇，除去季節的變動），便是從三月的一〇三·五昇到了六月的一〇五·〇；如果從部分的資料判斷，則在七月和八月間還可見到幾分上昇的現象。</p>
<p>就各個國家的情形來說，顯示特別好調的是英國。本來在去年夏季英國經濟就陷入了停頓狀况，今春又才開始新的上昇，最近這個上昇更有顯著的表現。但此種上昇的主要支柱，與到去年還繼續着的初期的上昇同樣，是建築活動，特別是住宅建築的活况。就楚屬於英鎊集團的其他國家，其一般生產活動的上昇在最折還是繼續着的。在自治領內，住宅建築和工業界的投資景氣現在還繼續着。斯干的那維亞半島諸國的情形也不壞；雖在輸出方面最近有點停頓狀態，但其生產和就業人數還有增加。特別有興味的是在本年三月末貶低了幣値百分之二十八的比利時，牠在最近也有顯著的景氣改善。很顯然的，在其工業製造品中演着大的任務的輸出，因爲輸出產品的價格要適應通貨的减價，雖在數量上沒有什麼大的增加，但隨着貨幣的貶値而來的物價騰貴及收益關係的一般改善，却給與了生產和就業人數之增加以很大的刺激，此種情形，更由政府的勞動授與政策而強化，而保持着了。意大利在過去也表示着異常的生產增加。這個國家在本年初，政府內部有保守主義和軍擴主義的爭鬥，經過了半年的時間，因後者獲得了勝利，使現在意大利經濟正陷於强力的戰爭準備的漩渦中。軍需工業顯示出猛烈的發展，生產每月都有增加，物價也日益高張。德國的經濟活兌，也是軍需景氣的表現。此外，如奧大利和捷克斯拉夫等國，其生產都表示着顯著的增加。</p>
<p>與這些景氣上昇的國家的情形相反的，是西歐的金集團諸國；這些國家還在繼績不景氣中。至於美國，如果只从本年上半期來說，則可說是景氣後退國。美國在本年上半期與去冬的强力的景氣上昇相較，楚表現了「中間反動，但是因爲農村購買力的好轉與投資活動的漸次增大，現在比較以前的中間反動輕微了；而且，自七月以來，新的比較强力的上昇運動還正在開展着。</p>
<p>單就世界工業生產看來，在本年上半期中，也是在繼續上昇的，雖然比較去年下半期中的回復，其速度要緩慢得多。據柏林景氣研究所的調查，若以一九二八年等於一〇〇，則去年六月的指數便是九一。八，十二月就達到了一〇二·三，對此，今年一月的指數楚一〇二·六，六月是上昇到了一〇五·〇。由是本年世界生產之在繼續上昇及其速度的情形便可顯見了。</p>
<p>據國際聯明月報所載，最近世界各國的生淤指數的情况如下：（一九二八年等於一〇〇）</p>
<p>一九三年平均　一九三五年一月　三月　五月　六月</p>
<p>美國　七一·二　八二·〇　七九·三　七六·六　七七·〇</p>

<p>那威　一一六·六　一〇九·五　一一二·九　一一七·五　一二五·五</p>

<p>比利時　七〇·八　六八·一　六七·六　七三·七　——</p>
<p>法國　七八·〇　七三·二　七三·二　七二·七　七二·四</p>
<p>荷蘭　七一·六　七〇·九　六九·〇　〇·九　——</p>
<p>德國　八〇·五　八五·〇　九二·〇　七九六·五　九五·四</p>
<p>意大利　八八·三　九二·五　一〇四·〇　一一三·六　一〇二·一</p>
<p>波蘭　六二·八　五九·六　六四·七　六五·〇　六七·九</p>
<p>奧大利　七四·〇　七七·四　七四·九　七九·一　——</p>
<p>捷克　六九·四　六七·四　六七·七　六九·〇　（四月）</p>
<p>智利　一三〇·〇　一三五·三　一四三·三　一四七·八　——</p>
<p>日本　一四三·四　一四六·六　一五九·〇　一五九·三　（四月）</p>
<p>世界　九五·二　一〇二·六　一〇三·五　一〇五·〇　（四月）</p>
<p>依上表，我們更是可以具體看出最近世界各國的生產指數之上昇現象的。</p>
<p>在上半期的生產活動中値得注意的，是資本生產開始表現出了顯著的增加。在主要的景氣上昇國家中，比較去年末以來的消費生產的增加，更可見到資本生產之急速的上昇運動。這不消說是顯示投資活動的活潑化的。</p>
<p>但是，這樣的世界景氣的發生和發展，並不是由於世界經濟自然的發展使然的，其主要原因是：第一，是軍需工業的發展。本來世界各國的軍需工業的現狀，是無法知其詳情的，但是，最近世界各國的武器，彈藥，軍艦和飛機的貿易之驚人的發展，乃是很明顯的事實；單由這一事實也够證明目前世界的軍需工業之發展現象了。據柏林景氣研究所的　查，世界的軍費在從一九二九年到一九三五年間，是從百五十億乃至百七十億馬克增加至了二百四十億乃至三百十億：最近列强的軍需開支和預算都有很大的增加，是則目前世界的軍費當在三百十億以上了。這樣大的數目字，當然更是表現了最近世界軍需工業之特別發展。同時，如美國等在最近之特別擴張鋼鐵工塲和化學工業，也可以當作巨前世界軍需工業之發展來看待。第二楚建築工業的好兌。這是因爲在恐慌期中，資本利率長期的低下，建築材料的價格和工資都减低了許多，而一般工業又不能容納大量的資本，所以建築工業才一時地發展了起來。但是，就在這樣的條件之下，所謂建築工業還楚在嶼家的有計劃的帮助之下發展起來的。如英國政府之努力輔助建築工業，便是顯明的　證。同時，在建築工業的發展中値得特別注意的，是關於地下工事，治水工程，交通建築等所謂公共事業的建設。這樣的公共事業的建設可說是各國的勞動授與計畫的中心，是在全投資中演着决定的脚色的。在這樣的勞働授與的計劃下，在建設所謂公共事業中，本年上半期美國曾决定了四十八億美金的大計劃，英國和比利時也有新計劃成立，法國是開始了新的工程，德國和意大利還在繼續過去的努力。第三，如世界各國之實行通貨膨脹政策，實行經濟的國家主義，以努力剝勞工，都可說是這裏的主要原因之一。——以上三者，便是造成目前世界經濟的好轉，所謂景氣的主要原因。</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>但是，軍需工業之驚人發展，乃是列張積極準備戰爭的明白表現；所謂公共建築的發達，所謂通貨膨脹和經濟的國家主義政策之施行，亦與準備戰爭有深切的關係。所以，最近的所謂景氣上昇，經濟好轉，實在是變態的，而且是戰爭危機的象徵。</p>
<p>書報介紹</p>
<h3>介紹「大衆生活」</h3>
<p>— 樂</p>
<p>—韜奮編，生活書店出版—</p>
<p>雜誌年後的今日，我們再漫步於雜誌市塲中，所見到的凄凉景象正反映着我們的讀者們的胃口日趨低落，一份雜誌的號召力，已經不在其內容，而在於其封面上是否有半裸的明星，肉感的大腿，或文字中有否揭發某一女人的隱私。這種讀物界的墮落，眞使人不忍想起我們的貴同胞在所謂國難臨頭的時期中所過的永遠不覺醒的生活。</p>
<p>現下我國難誌的數量，與文化水準較高的國家此較起來，本是少得可憐，但我們雜誌市塲中旣是充滿着那樣的刋物，確又不能不使我們嫌其太多。現在「大衆生活」又創刊了！在「嫌其太多」的雜誌中，是否又是徒增「太多者」的數量呢？不，絕對不，她確是另有共創刋的意義的。</p>
<p>無疑地，「大衆生活」是一般讀者所喜愛的東西，雖僅創刋一期，但我認爲在一般讀物中，她確實有其尖銳的奮鬥精神，特別是一切刋物所早已厭倦談，不敢談，不忍談的「民族解放」的正義呼聲，充滿在「大衆生活」的各個篇幅中，這是我們今日求生的呼聲，也是久處苦悶環境中的民衆們所急欲一吐的呼聲，這一點，可以說是「大衆生活」的成功之處。</p>
<p>韜奮在發刊詞「我們的燈塔」中作結論日：「力求民族解放的實現，封建殘餘的　除，個人主義的克服：這三大目標，——在汪洋大海怒濤駭浪中的我們的燈塔，——是楚當前全中國大衆所要努力的重大使命；我們願竭誠盡力，排除萬難，以文化方面推動這個大運動的前進！」這三大目標的指示，是診斷着中華民族現下的疾病而得的治方。假使「大衆生活」嗣後能不爲强禦所屈，針對着這三大目標，推動着解放民族的壯烈運動，實是今年雜誌市塲上重大的收獲。誠如金仲華先生在「談民族的自信力」一文中說：「一個民族對於它本身的生存和發展，應該有一種自信力。…………一般市民的逃避和苟安，都是不得已的。國家對於外來的侵略沒有抵抗，人民的安全不能獲得保障，我們的整個民族是在被分割肢解，所謂民族的自信力怎樣能够鼓起來呢？「民族復興」「民族解放」等等口號的成爲紙面文章，是由於這樣的緣故。然而，在根本上，民族的自信力究竟是必要的；尤其是我們的被壓迫民族，若要求生存，求發展，祇有相信自己的力量。」爲了這一點「民族自信力」的保存，我們實不禁切盼「大衆生活」的永生！</p>
<p>這一期中各文，內容大致都極充實，而尤當爲讀者注意者，厥唯「幣制改革以後」及「談談土地村有」兩文。「幣制改革」和「土地邨有」不但是最近政治上的兩件大事，也是我們近日所常在口頭上談論的問題。而章乃器先生給我們對貨幣改革的認識，及直夫給我們對土地頓有的分析，均有卓特的見解。</p>
<p>章先生吿訴我們，幣制改革是有限制的通貨臌脹。牠的效果能刺激購賣力，然而不能產生購買；能刺激物價，然而不能穩定物價。所以他對於貨幣改革的評價如下：</p>
<p>「……他們反果爲因，把一切恐慌的罪惡都輕輕的推到貨幣上去，而主張只要臌脹通貨，使貨幣貶低，就可根本的掃除恐慌了。在中國，他們便把白銀問題提得比天還要高，以爲一切喜怒哀樂都是白銀在那里作崇；而把更基本的半殖民地形態，整個的帝國主義勢力，更嚴重的帝國主義軍事侵略，以及種種一切國內封建勢力的肆虐，都一筆撇開了。」</p>
<p>他中心的要旨是：</p>
<p>「中國民族未曾得着解放以前，一切的繁榮都是虛偽的——這是少數帝國主義的代理人在大衆啼飢號寒當中誇耀他們富貴尊榮的把戲！而中國民族解放的取得，也决不是靠少數人玩把戲，掉槍花，服睛一霎，老母雞便會變成　的；牠是需要大衆在艱難困苦的鬥爭中奪取過來的。」</p>
<p>這里使我們充分認識，在次殖民地狀態下，要統一幣制，乃不可能的夢想。</p>
<p>直夫先生吿訴我們，關於土地邨有的主張，不過是大地主們自己見到了土地問題的嚴重，所施的烟幕：因爲假使土地邨有辦法實行之後，「土地邨有了，執管士地的是跟現在一樣的邨公所，而負責征收各項稅捐的也是跟現在一樣的邨公所。山西目前的邨公所也跟其他各省一樣是地主富農豪紳的辦公廳。」其結果是「農民出了錢，沒有得到土地，地主豪紳得了錢（收回債本），田地還留在他們手裏，」所以土地邨有决不是國有，土地邨有的辦法只不過是「替封建殘餘作更有力的保留」而已。要眞正解决土地問題，眼前自有一條大路可走，我們知道「中國封建渣滓的背後，是有帝國主義在撑腰，」因此，「中國土地問題的澈底解决，同時也就要摧殘帝國主義在華的勢力。解决土地問題跟爭取民族解放是中國改造運動兩個分柝不開的基本任務。」</p>
<p>這種觀點是很正確的。</p>
<p>「大衆生活」確是目前可看的讀物，我敢以至誠推薦於諸君之前。</p>

<h3>女店主</h3>
<p>— 張麗莉女士談</p>
<p>我是崑山人，自幼生長在北平。我出世的時候正是父親在北平開木器店的第二年，那時他的店事很興隆，我所遭遇的家庭環境當然是很融和愉快的。不過他死守着「女子無才更是德」的　訓　　到我長到九歲時，還不讓我上學讀書。後來幸虧鄰居有幾位比我大幾歲的女孩子在讀書，她們沒有事時便把從「先生」那裏學釆的轉「批發給我，從此我好像砌　　，在學業上算是打好了一貼根基。到十二歲那年　　麼一二年級的小學課本，差不多我都能背誦；父親見我那樣好學，便也不再固執成見，把我送到學校裏去了。</p>
<p>中學卒　後，父親的力量不允許我再想升學，同時，木　佔因受時局的影響。在過時竟不能維持，生活的迫害使我不能不踏進社會騙一碗飯吃，以减輕家裏的負担，於是我便離開北平而往天津去了。</p>
<p>到了天津之後，有一天，我在報上看到了一條很小的招考電影演員的廣吿，上面所規定的年齡，資格，自問都還與我相合；這在到天津有一星期之久的我看來，自然不啻是天外飛來的一樁喜訊了。</p>
<p>我從寓所裏出來，急忙僱了車子朝那家公司拉去。半點鐘過後，巳經可以看到那家貼有一張佈吿似的公司門口，黑壓壓的人頭堆成了一個圓圈。這天能够給我在那麼多的人　中闢出一條「生路」，跨進那家公司的門檻，的確還虧我穿的一身漂亮衣服；因爲當我掙扎前進時，一般投考的羣衆都回頭瞥我一眼便自動地讓開了，大約他們都誤會我是這公司裏的「明星」之流的人物，所以都肯那麼「禮讓」。</p>
<p>我走到報名處，照例是繳費一元，半身及全身的小照各一張；當時便有幾個西裝靑年前來招呼，牧了錢和小照，同時，很和氣的和我說：「請你不要走，一會就可以考試。」</p>
<p>「祇要稍爲零一下就成！」</p>
<p>「你們招考的廣吿上，不是說先看了小照，三天之後再來試鏡頭麼？」我驚奇地望着他們說，當時心裏並沒想到他們另有什麼作用。</p>
<p>「是的，廣吿上是那麼說，但有時是看人取的啦！你等一會兒，準沒有錯兒！」幾個人都笑了。</p>
<p>爲了生活急於需要解决，就不得不接受他們的好意在那裏坐了；但在那短促時間裏，竟看到有好幾個進來報名的，都在他們冷淡　對待情形下走了，於是我心裏懷着的一個疑團便更加放大起來。</p>
<p>「這些男演員公司現時還不需要，所以今天不考。」他們中的一個好像看出了我懷疑的神悄，便走過來向我這麼解釋一下。</p>
<p>「旣不要男演員，爲什麼廣吿上又說招考「男」女演員呢？」</p>
<p>「盡招女演員，怕招入家議論的啊！」他囁嚅地說着，笑了。</p>
<p>半點多鐘過去了，才從裏面走來了一個小職員模樣的人，把我領到一座並不怎麼大的玻璃棚底下，在那裏已經站着了好幾個中年男女，彼此嘻喀哈哈地笑着，見了我進來便都强自歛起笑容，死盯着我不住的打量。</p>
<p>在那整人當中，首先走過來的大概是一個「導演」，他從那小職員手上把我照片拿去看了一下，又向我周身端詳了一番，似乎很滿意地把雙手朝胸前一擱，一本正經地問了我的姓名，年齡，籍貫。等到我說出我是崑山人時，他臉上顯出很驚奇而又欣喜的樣子望着我</p>
<p>業餘咖啡座</p>
<h3>談酒</h3>
<p>— 卜易</p>
<p>酒，化學家認爲是有麻醉性的飲料，而文人學士多當牠爲淸雅上品，故文人興酒特別有緣。杜甫詩云：李白一斗詩百篇，長安市上酒家眠，天子呼來不上船，自稱臣是酒中仙。」這位酒中仙是文學史上最有名的大酒徒了。劉伶有「酒德頌」之作，辛棄疾亦有揮酒杯的一首詞。今人中如魯迅郁達夫也都是酒中的好漢。讀郁達夫的最近日記，知他寓居杭州，差不多每晚要在湖上痛飲，興來時不免吟吟新句。魯迅，則有人嘲之爲「醉眼朦朧」，有人且爲作一杯在手的漫畫，想他對於他故鄉的醇醪，必能辨之有素也。</p>
<p>據說美國每年葡萄熟時，犯罪率有顯著的激增，酒之爲禍有如是者，所以他們的憂國之士，竟將禁酒的法條訂於堂堂律令之上。但嗜酒似乎是人類天性，中西一體的，美國人愛喝杯中物的熱忱並不下於我黃華胄裔。不過近年來這個黃金國也襲上了經濟恐慌的惡潮，自羅斯福總統進了白宮後，爲振興市面起見，他就取消禁酒法令。擄說在那初解禁的初晚，那般久受束縛的酒徒，大家都瘋狂般的暢飲終宵，不知「成都古今記」中所載的「十月酒市」，亦有美國解酒禁之初晚的情景否？</p>
<p>據社會學者說，酗酒不但足以增高犯罪率，並且是貧窮的致因之一，愛爾烏德氏就是這一派人的一個。他說：「調查各慈善機關所賙濟的人，差不多有四分之一是由於嗜酒。」美國五十人調查委員會在三十三個大都市中調查，三萬多寄養的案件中有百分之一八，四六是由於本人的嗜酒，有百分之九，三六是受了旁人嗜酒的害，所以因嗜酒而致貧的總數是百分之二七，八二。調查其餘美國都市的情形也是如此。英國都市中因嗜酒致貧的百分率比美國還高。據麻沙珠寒的工巡局調查，窮人中有百分之三九是直接由於嗜酒，或間接由於嗜酒。這無怪嗜酒的辛棄疾要將酒杯斥之而去，亦怪不得曹孟德要說酒可以亡國的話了。</p>
<p>「朋友」平於氏，酒徒也。雖不沈緬於老酒之中，然家藏佳釀甚多，嗜好之深殆無可以他物易之。他常邀幾個好友到他齋中痛飲終日，寒暑假日，我乘歸家之暇，亦常過齋暢飲。近平於氏額其書屋日：「苦酒庵」，蓋仿知堂老人「苦雨齋」之意也。然酒而必謂之曰「苦」，其用心亦良苦矣。</p>
<p>生當這個亂離世界，慷慨悲歌的知識階級中人，說話旣為環境所不許，衝破沈悶的空氣又爲力所不逮，於是取巧的就投入了「杜康」的懷抱。多飲酒，少說話，大家奉爲圭臬。麻醉呀，忘懷呀，寄沈痛於幽閒，全生命於亂世。所以酒之爲物殆爲世紀末的象徵。魏晋的頹唐風氣得以重見於今日，實有牠的歷史性的。</p>
<p>酒鄉，竟也是一條遁世的曲道。但李太白縱是痴狂，他却有勇氣在醉後觸犯世人所不敢觸犯的高力士；他縱是偷生於末世，他却仍有勇氣在泥醉之後作捕月之戲，以殉他的浪漫趣味。你能說他是將精神完全葬送於醇酒嗎？你能說他的醉眼中全無憎惡嗎？你能說他眞的浮沈一世，沒有足以使他身殉的事物嗎？</p>
<p>為此，我爲今日的一般酒徒惜！</p>
<p>「對酒當歌，人生幾何？」這樣悲壯的歌詞可惜也久已不聞了。</p>

<p>說；「崑山人怎麼會講那麼好的北京話？哈哈…」</p>
<p>「我是生長在北京的啦！」</p>
<p>「啊！怪不得長的像北京人一樣的。—你很喜歡拍影戲嗎？—你會游泳嗎？—騎馬呢？—啊，也會？開汽車行嗎？—哈哈！也會一點，可不錯！好罷，現在給你試一試鏡頭吧？」</p>
<p>他問了一大串，我祇是望着他點頭；那時我好像一隻猴子似的，他怎麼指揮我就怎麼動作。他呌我在鏡頭前面做了些正面的，側面的，坐的，橫躺的，背面的各種姿式，彷彿和一個「模特兒」在繪畫空中一般，祇是沒有裸體。</p>
<p>經過了那一番「考試」以後，算被他們認為滿意把我錄取了；每月的薪水祇有二十多元，膳宿問題還須由自己解决。第一部開拍的片子「險姻緣」，就决定由我主演。因為公司的資本有限，組製濫造便是他們的製片政策，結果吃苦的都是一些演員。月拿二十多元的薪水，要日夜不停的拍戲，你的精神濟不濟事，他們都可不管，祇要你每天能到塲飾一個角色就行。關於演技方面，導演先生也許還趨不上在我進公司試鏡頭的那天來得認眞。這部「陰姻緣」就在精製混濫造的政策下，僅花了五個月的工夫。後來據說這部片子是賺了錢，然而我却不願再留在那裏過「電影明星」癮了。</p>
<p>離開天津之後，給我站住脚的便是現在的上海。我在天津過影戲生活，上海方面的親戚都有點耳聞，所以我這次到上海，他們都勸我把「舊調重彈」，並介紹我加入孤星影片公司工作。這裏的範圍的確要比天津那家宏大，製片也很認眞。進孤星拍第一部片子「飛燕」，成績似覺比「險姻緣」稍有一點進步，所以公司在「飛燕」完成之後，又决定「花花世界」和「女偵探」兩部片子都由我主演；但不久因了我的婚姻問題，我像逃命似的一氣跑往新加坡過流亡的生活，這兩部片子的主角終究與我無緣！</p>
<p>我到新加坡，是由於在上海時就有一個朋友替我找好了一個位置，所以一到這裏便有事可做。我服務的這家機關是一個洋大人辦的進出口貿易洋行，營業很發達，尤以對中國輸入佔大部分。行裏一共用了三十多位華人，女的却祇我一個。月薪約有國幣八十多元。我的職務是跟一個華「買辦」做書記，事情却很淸閒，可是一天到晚應付他的功夫，却比做事還要麻煩。我在那兒很耐心的做了半年，後來終於因為有點「吃不消」而向他辭職了。</p>
<p>由新加坡回到北平後，我便進中央飯店附設的舞廳。半年來的舞女生活，的確使我積得了一點錢，所以袁良先生的禁令一下，我便趕快「改絃易　」，停止　　　　，創舉一爿與跳舞性質相近的酒排間；資本花了好幾千元，地點就在從前的東單食堂附近。這爿酒排間開張不久，一因女子招待在北平還是首創，一因我自己過去的一點「小名」；所以一般大學生便都「趨之若驚」，營業竟一天天地發達起來。我這酒排間用女子招待，依我的本心並沒有別的用意存在，因為這斑充招待的女子過去都是從我學舞的學生，自跳舞禁令一下，她們便都沒有生活，所以我才把她們請來幫我料理的。不過一般顧客來這裏的目的，却和我的原意不同。他們到這酒排間來的目的無非是「尋花問柳」的樂其所樂，我雖是這裏的一個女主人，但有時為了營業，却也不得不讓他們無禮的調笑一回。因此這酒排間的日常收入，每到晚上總計一下，倒也有好幾百元的一個大數目，招待的「小賬」還不算在內；至於我個人的收穫便是「女掌櫃」的聲名一天比一天「盈耳」，顧客也一天天地增加起來。</p>
<p>酒排間的停閉是在二十二年的冬季。當時因為受時局的影響，北平一夕數驚，一般大學生和達官貴人到底曉得自己的性命要緊，大部份都離開「險地」而找他們的樂土去了；酒排間的基礎本是建築在他們身上，至此自不能不陷於坍塌的境地。過了不久，聽說辦京報的邵飄萍先生的夫人湯修　女士要到上海，我連忙跑去找她，約定同時南下。到了上海，經她的介紹，便進了大華舞塲。第一期的合同衹有三個月，後來老板鑒於我「營業」數字不差，才允和我簽了一張長期合同。自此以後，我的一切行動使得受合同上的拘束，所以今年父親去世時我不能回北平，也就是因了這張合同的作祟！在這裏的收入比北平時代雖不算壞，但精神上的損失却是有過之而無不及！我現在雖然也還脫離不了這項職業，但我相信總有一天會能如我的心願和它永訣的呀！</p>
<p>上次在金城上演了一次「風流寡婦」，便是我想脫離舞女生活的初步嘗試；這齣戲演來雖然不佳，可是因為我祇經過三天讀劇本的時間而得着這不好的成果，自問或不致愧對導演吧？</p>

<h3>強力婚姻</h3>
<p>— 馬科崙</p>
<p>靑海湟源通訊</p>
<p>在靑海這個偏僻的省份裏，除却作為省會的西寗給我一點兒初期資本主義的感覺外，其餘的鄕村城市可說是把我拉回到古代社會去了。在這兒見着了以物易物的商業情形，逐水草而居的遊牧生活，野蠻的婚姻制度，……。住居在這個省份裏的有蒙人，藏人，回人，漢人，還有土人（據說是趙充國實邊時帶去的風陽人），都各有其不同的生活，習慣，風俗，道德。如果把這些一一的詳細記載也來，也許要民為數百萬言的專書，現在只就回民的婚姻情形作為故事來談談。</p>
<p>這兒所說的回民是指的「撒拉」（回族種類很多），他們大都過的耕種生活，在當地回民中可算是比較開化的。</p>
<p>依回民一般的習俗，女兒是不嫁給別個民族的。本來他們對於漢人很重視和羨慕，但也不願意把女兒嫁給他們。這種閉關主義自然是由來已久，一時不能改變。同時，漢人的職業大半是經商，無論在鄕村和城市，都是遷徒無常的；他們很怕自己的女兒給人帶走遠方，以後沒有再見的機會。因為回俗原是重女輕男，其家個好女兒，全族都很珍貴，假如嫁給漢人，一旦帶到別處去了，那就等於失掉一件寳貝那麼悲痛！不過，他們倒願意娶漢人的女兒做媳婦，這一則由於漢人的女兒比較美麗，二乃娶進門後便成了他家的寳貝，以後再不會失掉的。在這種情形下，漢人似乎還處於低等地位，不過兩族通婚的事實究竟很少。</p>
<p>回民對於犯奸的行為，一向認為是罪大惡極，尤其是對於已婚的女人防範得更嚴。假如發現了這類的勾當，不但無條件的把男女主角處死，就是雙方的家長也要遭受很重的責罰和侮辱。然而話雖如此，偸香竊玉之事仍是難免的，所以關於這類的殘酷行為常可見着或聽到。</p>
<p>子女的婚姻大事全是經過「父母之命，媒妁之言」而完成。提議婚事大都由男家主動，當自己的兒子快要成人的時候，大槪平日已看中了「門當戶對」的某家姑娘，於是便邀媒人前去說親。這項手續並不麻煩，只請媒人帶着說親的專門禮物（茶和酒，其餘加一點糖食，羊肉），坐着轎車，神氣十足的去到女家，到了那邊之後，祇須說明受的某家之託，不必表明來意，女家便可心領神會了。如果茶和酒都已收下，那就是允許訂婚的表示，否則媒人還得把這兩項東西帶了回來。</p>
<p>結婚的良辰吉日是由女家請「阿訇」選擇的（所謂阿訇，是以唸經為職業的人，他們不事生產，專給別人做紅白喜事，所得的禮物便拿來維持生活）。到了結婚的上午，男家的親屬朋友，大夥兒的或乘車或騎馬，簇擁着新郎向女家出發，沿途歡天喜地的，空氣都變得很活潑了。進了門，吃過早點（一杯奶茶，一把麵做的繖子），女家的親戚，朋友，又請着這大夥兒去到自己家裏吃午餐，如此你請過去，我請過來，這一天，新郎和親屬朋友總要吃好幾家人的飲食。親朋請完後仍回到女家，這時唸經的阿訇們已經來了，他們依着尊卑（一個大阿訇有許多徒子徒孫）在庭堂時坐成一排，新郎便虔誠的跪在他們面前，於是大小阿訇一齊拉起嗓子，唸起經文來了。經文的內容大致是訓誡男子不可壓迫老婆，否則便要遭受上天的譴責。等到經聲停息，女家的家長親屬便都依着次序的用手按住新郎，盡量的施行一番壓榨，第一個壓過了，第二個又來，如此按二連三的，總要使新郎用盡力氣也不能掙扎起來，有許多竟給壓斷了手足或腿桿，終生成了殘廢！據說這種舉動的意義是：女兒出嫁後，身體和行動都要遭受男子的壓迫和支配，女家沒有過問的權利，因此趁着剛要過門的時候，給男子一種威嚇，使他以後不敢虐待女兒，同時也算是替女家出了一口惡氣！不過男家也早有準備，大槪伴送新郎的家屬都有保護他的責任，每當阿訇唸完了經，便有幾個身長力大的人，一壁抵抗女家的壓迫者，一壁保護新郎衝出重圍。逃出險地後，新郎便拿出雄威，奮勇跨上雕鞍，揚鞭躍馬的奔回自己家裏。所以依一般的習俗，新郎愈經得起壓榨，或很有力氣抵抗，而又人高馬壯的，就算頂漂亮，頂被人稱讚的了。假如新郎不善抵抗，男家的鑣師不很得力，那麼新郎吃虧就在，因為搶不出險地，就得多受一些壓迫，有時縱然救出，可是馬上又被女家奪回，這樣一而再，再而三，結果新郎不是衣服被撕成破片，便是身體受了損傷。像這種結婚禮節，眞使人不敢討老婆了！</p>
<p>同時女家不但對新郎施行這樣的殘酷手段，而且還要把他的長輩擒拿幾個，在臉上塗抹一些顏色（大半是油和炭灰），牽到街上或村間遊行一週，女家的親屬朋友都跟在後面，盡量的嘲笑，等到遊行完畢，纔得放行。這種舉動，算是向男家示威，因為女兒出嫁後，不但要受丈夫的管束，而且他的家長伯叔也得隨便支配她，所以女家趁着此時提出警吿，以免他們來在女兒面前作威作福！</p>
<p>到了黃昏時分，女家便用一張大的紅布把女兒包裹起來，由叔伯或哥哥扶上驉轎，一般親屬朋友都充送親的人，一路浩浩蕩蕩的扯到男家。可是剛到院門口（大都沒有院門，直到庭堂的階沿邊），男家早已集合起了許多壯士，守在那兒，不准進門，於是女家的家屬中有幾個力氣大的，便抱着新娘直向門里邁進，而男家的壯士也不示弱，連對方的家屬和新娘都要被向外面推擲。這樣，一個要進門，一個不准進來，你來我住的鏖戰良久，所謂新娘簡直成了一件棄物。到了關爭劇烈的時候，兩邊喊聲震天，彷彿有千軍萬馬捉對兒撕殺一樣。同時男家還預備的有槍刀，假如女家十分兇蠻，難免不唯槍耍刀以圖威嚇，但有時失手也會送掉幾條性命的（槍裏面裝的鐵沙子）。所以這種拒婚的假過塲竟弄得兩方失了和氣，眞的械關起來，也是常有的現象！據回民自己的解釋：拒絕新娘進門，一則可以表示自己的尊貴；別人送女兒來，自己還不願要。二則預先警吿新娘，進了男家的門，行為便要端正，否則是要被逐出門去的！</p>
<p>結果新娘還是由她家屬揹進了男家的房門，安置在坑上，這時同來的奶娘或嬸母，便給她解去紅布，脫去處女時代的衣服，然後把頭髮挽成餅髻，穿上婦人衣服。裝飾完畢，新郎纔進來同她喝杯奶茶，跟卽親戚朋友便來鬧房。這一夜夫妻雖可完成好事，然而彼此所受的驚嚇和委曲也就很多了！</p>
<p>第二天，新娘打早的便穿好衣服，走到庭堂裏，臉兒對着門外的天空，十分恭敬的「口中唸唸有詞」，這算是當婦人後向上天表示懺悔的意思。接着男家的親戚朋友邀請女家的親戚朋友吃午餐，依例是這家請了，那家又請。於是婚禮便吿完成了！</p>

<h3>文學的「永久價値」問題</h3>
<p>— 魯飛</p>
<p>荷馬和但丁　詩雖是很古的，但現在也還有人讀它們；屠格湼夫和托爾斯泰的小說雖是在十九世紀的俄羅斯產生的，但直到現在還為全世界人所讚賞；易卜生和戈果爾雖然早已死了，但他們的「娜拉」和「欽差大臣」至今還在舞臺上表現，而且在演出時還有廣大的觀衆，依據這些事實，一般絕對論者都說文學作品有永遠不變的價値。在他們看來，以為一個偉大的文學作品，不管在什麼時間和地方，都是具有同樣偉大的價値的；它經得起時間和空間的試騐，它的價値是永垂不朽的；一般稱某偉大作品為「不朽之作」的意義，就在表明那作品之具有永恒不變的價値。假使你要反對這種意見，那他們就要請你解釋：為什麼一個偉大的古典作品直到現在乃至後來都還為人愛好稱讚呢。</p>
<p>不錯，偉大的古典作品至今尚有人讀，這是事實。然而，一個偉大作品在其產生時和在它產生的時代過去之後所起的社會作用和影響恐怕是不同的吧。歌德的「少年維特之煩惱」，當其出現時，就好像猛烈的野火樣燃燒着德國乃至歐洲靑年們的心靈，使他們都瘋狂似的從各方面去追慕維持，其中甚至有許多靑年效法維持而實行自殺了，所謂「維特熱」竟成為了那時的一個主要的時代精神表現；今天呢，雖然還有不少的靑年在讀「少年維特之煩惱」，而且他們在讀的時候也很感動，但在我們的時代中却沒有「維特熱」於一八三零年二月十五日夜間在法蘭西劇塲上演時，在劇塲中曾引起了劇烈的爭鬥，結果是新的浪漫主義戰勝了古典主義，為法國乃至歐洲文學開闢了一條新的道路；可是，現在即使「歐那尼」在各處繼續上演，也不能給我們時代的文學開闢出新的道路。此外，如上引的荷馬和但丁的詩，屠格湼夫和托爾斯泰的小說，易卜生和戈果爾的戲劇，雖然在其產生時和現在都有人讀，但在其產生時的人和現在的人讀起來所生的感覺是不同的，因而其社會作用和影響也是各時相異的。倘若文學是社會的產物同時又是反作用於社會的，那麼，文學作品的價値之高下，就當以其反映現實社會的正確的程度和其對社會所起的反作用之大小來决定。這樣，我們便可以說，旣然一個偉大的文學作品在其產生時和其產生的時代過去之後所起的社會作用和影響是不相同的，那這作品的價値也是各時相異的了，雖然偉大的作品無論在什麼時代都有人讀，都有其存在意義。</p>
<p>我們以為文學是人生的反映。人類生活在現實社會中，不僅要明白現實的生活環境，而且還須知道過去的人生；不僅喜歡反映現實生活的文學作品，而且也注意反映過去的人生的文學創作；所以，就是古舊的文學作品現在也有人讀。在這中間，那些偉大的古典作品，不消說是藝術地反映了其時代的某種客觀眞實的，這在現在的人類為要明白過去的客觀的眞實，為要在過去的藝術中取法來創作現在的藝術，當然更有一讀的必要。所謂偉大的古典作品至今尚有人讀的意義即在此。這道理我們還可從人類對於過去的一般思想的著作之硏究這件事來表明。如亞里士多德和柏拉圖的哲學至今也還有人在閱讀硏究，但我們却不能說他們的哲學著作的意義和價値在二十世紀和存貸是一樣的。同樣，歌德的「少年維特之煩惱」和雨果的「歐那尼」雖然現在還有人在讀，但我們也不能國此就說其價値在其產生時與現在是全同的。自然，一個偉大的古典文學作品比較一本偉大的古典的哲學著作也許更能吸引人，更能使人「百讀不厭」，但這是因為文學的特性是在具體地以活的形象來表現人生，是比較更多地訴於人的感情的；我們不能因為好的文學作品無論在什麼時候都能使人「百讀不厭」這事實就說文學有永遠不變的價値。而且，老實說吧，所謂「百讀不厭」也是相對的。泡特萊爾的詩，王爾德的小說，對於那些過着頹廢的享樂生活者和具有這種思想的人當然是「百讀不厭」的，但對於認眞生活的人恐怕未必是如此吧。左拉和福羅培爾的小說雖為敢於接近社會實生活者所「百讀不厭」，但法國的道學先生們却要禁止有女孩子的家庭存放左拉的作品。由此可見說偉大的古典作品為人「百讀不厭」這話的意義並不是絕對的，國而依此就認為文學有永久的價値尤其不對。</p>
<p>但是，這樣說並不是從另一方同來把問題絕對化，說偉大的文學作品只是在其產生時才有偉大的價値，其產生的時代一過去就無價値可言：這乃是絕對的相對論者的說法，是與上述的絕對論者同樣謬誤的。首先，文學是繼續着發展的，沒有過去的文學，便不會有後來的文學，沒有過去的文學的偉大價値，後來文學的偉大價値便無由產生，所以，過去的文學作品如在其產生時有何等的現實的價値，那牠在文學的史的發展過程中也必然有一定的歷史價値。在這個意義上，那些最正確地描寫了過去時代的人生，過去時代的客觀眞實的偉大的古典作品，其在文學的史的發展過程中的價値當然是更偉大的。例如，巴爾扎克的小說，便是正確地而且藝術地表現了「王政復古」和「七月專制」時代的法蘭西社會的，弗里契說他描寫當時法國社會的精確與其後某大思想家「硏究資本主義本質時的精確同樣」，像這樣偉大的小說作品，不僅在其產生時有偉大的意義和價値，而且對於文學發展史的車輪之前進的推動力量也是很大的，因而牠在文學史上的價値當然也就非常偉大了。在這點意義上，我們才可以說巴爾扎克和與他同等的偉大作家的偉大作品是「不朽之作」。復次，所謂現實和歷史並非絕對立着的，反之，歷史是現實的母親，現實則是歷史中的一環。根據這個理由，我們可以說現在的文學是從過去文學中產生出來的，假使我們不緊接着過去文學的發展階段開步向前邁進，不取法過去文學來創作現在的文學，那我們便沒有辦法來建設現在的新文學了。因此，過去的偉大的作品，不僅在其產生時和在文學史上各有其一定的價値，就是在現時也有其一定的價値的。我最近曾在一篇短文中論及我們何以要再批判偉大的古典作品的問題，在那裏我曾說國為我們要科學地評定偉大的古典作品在其產生時，在文學史中和在目前的意義和價値，所以才要對偉大的古典作品實行再批判。在這裏我又提出這個問題來，盼望評價偉大的古典作品的現代的批評家們不要只是說明其在產生時的意義和價値，而必須同時表明其在文學史上和在目前的意義和價値，才可說是完成了自己的任務。最後，偉大的文學作品在文學史上在目前旣然都有其一定的價値，那麼，雖是一個偉大的文學作品沒有永遠不變的絕對價値，但在上述的意義下，我們是當承認其客觀意義和價値是永遠存在着的。</p>
<p>再說簡明一點：因為文學是隨社會之發展變化而發展變化，其意義和價値也是隨着社會之發展變化而差異的，所以我們不能說偉大的作品的意義和價値在任何時間空間中都是一樣，說它有永遠不變的價値；又因為偉大的文學作品在其產生時，在文學史上，在目前都各有其一定的意義和價値，雖然它們是各不相同的，所以在這相對的意義上，我們也承認偉大的文學作品的客觀意義和價値是永遠存在着的。——這便是我們對於文學作品的永久價値問題的一個原則的解答。</p>

<h3>提賬簿（四）</h3>
<p>— 濮魚</p>
<p>到了元太槽坊，我老是不說來意，江錫五那小子倒也在行，總依我的臉色說話，李二爹雖微微有點詫異，但是忠厚的臉上也找不出奸巧的痕跡；他很客氣的叫了一桌菜，又選了一瓶上等「陳色」，樣兒是很恭順的。席間他談說生意一天比一天淸淡，運到上海的酒有時還撈不够本，我祇是唯唯的應着，心裏却在算計對付的方法！</p>
<p>吃過飯，他領我們到賬房後面的小屋裏。那兒的烟燈剛已預備，我正想提一提勁兒，便不客氣的先倒是榻上。他趕快給我裹烟泡，還問我是不是行家，我說祇有一點毛毛癮。其實三個鐘頭不吸，便要打呵欠，流淸鼻涕！</p>
<p>抽完兩顆泡子，全身都增加了力氣，於是站起來伸一伸腰，裝一張無可奈何的臉子：</p>
<p>「呵！李老闆，很抱歉！無事不敢驚擾……」我瞄了一眼他那驚疑的臉色，便單刀直入的說，「前兒你們的酒，不是沒買完說證嗎？」</p>
<p>「是的，主任叫我不買的！」他骨碌碌的站下榻邊，左手提烟槍，右手拿通針。</p>
<p>「可是現在出亂子啦！」</p>
<p>「怎麼？」</p>
<p>「哼！省局來了公事，指定你們漏稅！」我瞧他那蒼白的臉子忽然變成靑色，烟槍，通針都掉落地上，於是又加重語氣：「那公事雷厲風行的，叫我們局長三天覆案！」</p>
<p>「但是……」他搔着光頭，兩眼凄暗的盯着我，「但是責任歸你們局上呀！我……不那樣幹，你勸我……」</p>
<p>糟啦！這老東西的腦筋並不簡單，居然咬着我了。本來他有烏的過錯！明明是我的圈套。就拿前兒來說，他的酒剛出窖口，便親自來局上買完稅證，我看他人還老實，便悄悄帶在屋子里，一半勸誘，一半威嚇，叫他少納二百元，不領完稅證，並且准許他的酒在本局所</p>

<p>轄四縣內銷售，他勉强承認了，還　我負責任。我　　拍着胸膛說；我就代表菸酒局，　敢搗亂！你想，我爲什麼要少收錢，不發完稅證？因爲稅證是省局發的，賣去一張便要解還一張的錢，這種臨時錢莊的生意，誰願敬心誠意的幹？所以我不發稅證，得他四百元凈欵。就少收二百元，又同我有什麼關係，不過這老東西前見佔了便宜，我當然要抓他的瘡眼，今天想推脫，那可行？擒拿不穩，我也不願自找麻煩了！於是拿出居高臨下的態度，預備把他一下摔倒：</p>

<h3>The New Salt Law Should Be Implemented Expediently</h3>
<p>— Establishing</p>
<p>The Fifth National Congress, Third Plenary Session, resolved: Request the National Government to order the relevant authorities to implement the new salt law by region at the end of the 25th year of the Republic. The new salt law was passed by the Legislative Yuan as early as March 21st of the 20th year of the Republic and promulgated by the National Government on May 30th. It contains a total of seven chapters and thirty-nine articles. The main points are: (1) Tax collection at the salt production sites, allowing people to buy and sell freely, and no one shall be allowed to monopolize, so as to fundamentally eradicate the long-standing malpractices of exclusive merchants and salt distribution certificates. (2) Salt shall not be produced without government permission, so as to regulate the production and sales of salt and make supply and demand correspond. (3) Salt is divided into three categories: edible salt, fishing salt, and salt for industrial and agricultural use, and salt quality inspectors shall be set up to check whether the quality of edible salt meets the standards, so as to emphasize people's health. (4) Salt tax: edible salt is taxed at five national currency yuan per hundred kilograms, and fishing salt is taxed at three national currency jiao per hundred kilograms, with no additional or surcharges, so as to reward industry and agriculture and reduce the burden on the people. In addition, it is stipulated that after the promulgation of the new salt law, a salt administration reform committee should be established directly under the Executive Yuan to promote the implementation of the new law. This is truly a code suitable for the needs of today.</p>
<p>Salt is a daily necessity for our people. It is a common knowledge that the taxation of edible salt does not conform to the principles of taxation. There are many examples of developed countries temporarily using salt tax as a source of revenue due to treasury deficits. However, most of them have fundamentally abolished it. In our country, salt tax is a major source of national tax revenue and is used as a guarantee for foreign debt. This is a major drawback in the tax system. The so-called salt distribution certificates, exclusive merchants, official transportation, commercial transportation, official salt, private salt, etc., are even more diverse and numerous. Salt merchants take advantage of monopolistic exploitation, and salt farmers and consumers suffer. The former Beijing government, in view of this, repeatedly attempted to reform. It first proposed to abolish the salt distribution certificate system, collect taxes at the salt production sites, and allow people to buy and sell freely. However, the salt distribution certificate system was a source of profit for salt merchants, who were unwilling to give it up easily. Therefore, they used their financial power to lobby in various ways, and the reform plan was shelved. In the 17th year of the Republic, the First National Finance Conference resolved to reform the salt administration, with tax collection at the salt production sites and free trade as the principles. The first step was to reorganize salt production sites and unify salt taxes. In July of the 18th year, the Legislative Yuan, based on the resolution of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee to reorganize the salt law, consulted the Executive Yuan to order the Ministry of Finance to draft a new salt law and send it to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. In May of the following year, the Legislative Yuan stated that the Ministry of Finance had delayed in drafting the law, so the President of the Yuan designated a committee to draft the salt law. In December of that year, the term of the first Legislative Yuan ended, and the work was interrupted. After the second Legislative Yuan took office, it continued to draft the law. By March of the 20th year, the new salt law was finally established.</p>
<p>After the promulgation of the new salt law, salt merchants continued to oppose it and obstruct it in every possible way. As a result, this good law that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood has not been implemented after four and a half years. During this period, not only has the general public suffered from the pain caused by the old salt system, but also salt farmers in various places have frequently caused excessive actions due to the existence of the salt distribution certificate system. The recent incident of Zhejiang salt farmers' "eating the big households" in September of this year is the most recent example. This is truly regrettable. Now, the Fifth National Congress has a resolution to urge the government to implement the new salt law, which is certainly welcomed by us. However, the implementation of the resolution is even more what we earnestly hope for.</p>
<h3>First, Uphold Morality to Revitalize People's Hearts</h3>
<p>The Premier devoted himself to the revolution, taking the restoration of national morality as the foundation for restoring the nation's position. Investigating the governance and chaos of the country, it is externally linked to the rise and fall of people's hearts. Evidenced by the countless martyrs of our party who have sacrificed themselves for righteousness since the revolution, they were all nurtured by the essential principles that have been passed down for thousands of years. It is known that respecting oneself is essential, and then difficulties can be overcome and the country can be secured. This conference has passed the code of conduct for party members to believe and practice, and also hopes to work with our compatriots throughout the country to make efforts in the primary task of revitalization. Summarizing its essence, there are four points: First, earnestly promote the teachings of the Premier, and consistently engage in sincere propaganda, so that every household throughout the country knows it, and everyone has respect and sincerity, and knows the glory of our nation's history and the importance of its position in the world, so as to restore the inherent moral intelligence, catch up with the world's culture, and build the foundation of the Republic for generations to come. Second, establish a system of etiquette that is appropriate, simple and moderate, and combines culture and substance, corresponding to modern life for the nation, society, family, and individual. Third, create majestic, righteous, upright, vigorous, and peaceful music corresponding to the national, social, and public life, to cultivate national morality and nourish the enduring life of the nation's people. Fourth, in practical social life, promote the habit of serving, helping each other, being clean and orderly, and cultivate a natural style, so as to establish the foundation of self-discipline and cooperation.</p>
<h3>Second, Promote Practical Learning to Lay the Foundation of the Nation</h3>
<p>Since ancient times, prosperity and decline, rise and fall, have all been due to academics. The ability of academics to present their great functions and contribute to the development of culture must correspond to the reality of the times, places, and people, and must also meet the genuine requirements of the nation and society for overall survival and development. In today's competitive world, to catch up, we should focus our efforts on the primary plan, which is as follows: First, the research work of the Academia Sinica and all academic research institutions, and the research work of all public and private universities, must be closely linked to the nation and society, "so that the nation can" use technology and society can benefit from academics. Second, establish a scholarship system, quickly and fully promote it, so that true talents have a way to advance their studies and practical learning can be subsidized. Third, promote the independence and development of Chinese science, emphasizing both natural sciences and humanities, so that academics can on the one hand understand the nature of things and on the other hand understand human nature, in order to increase human power, develop material resources, and create a solid national strength to promote lasting civilization. Fourth, emphasize the cultivation of technology, promote the establishment of technical specializations, so as to correct the trend of biased theory and receive the benefits of specialized study, in order to meet the urgent needs of national material construction.</p>
<h3>Third, Expand Education to Cultivate People's Strength</h3>
<p>Regarding the development and improvement of education, the resolutions of previous congresses of this party have been numerous. Now, we reiterate the previous resolutions and further highlight the main points to urge the government's determination and gather the will of the people. The first and second points are the foundation of education and need no further discussion. After examining the national conditions, it is also believed that literary education and military education should originate from the same spirit, and that both should be emphasized in the basic training of the people, in order to restore our country's inherent good practices and meet the needs of modern countries. Generally speaking, the items are as follows: First, implement the unification and improvement of textbooks, eliminate impractical subjects, and enrich the content of necessary subjects. Second, actively promote compulsory education and improve the primary and secondary school system. Primary schools should focus on the practical use of poor people who cannot continue their studies. Secondary schools should be based on the premise of seeking common interests for students who will and will not continue their studies, so that poor children have the opportunity to receive universal education and students acquire practical knowledge that can be used to make a living. Third, enrich the system of normal education, promote the establishment of normal education, and emphasize the cultivation of personality and the strengthening of patriotic concepts, in order to cultivate healthy teachers for primary and secondary schools. Fourth, develop women's education, cultivate kind, loving, and healthy mothers with both physical strength and knowledge, so as to alleviate the crisis of racial decline and lay a solid foundation for the nation and society. Fifth, increase education funding, reward the establishment of education funds, and at the same time make genuine efforts and pay close attention to controlling waste in schools at all levels. Sixth, universally promote national training, promote military education, and emphasize military morality, in order to cultivate the habit of group life among the people, strengthen the physical and mental development of the people, cultivate the foundation of social organization, and create the strength for national independence and freedom. Seventh, promote social education, promote adult continuing education, and combine education, cultivation, and defense, linking the relationship between politics and education, and cultivate the people's ability to save themselves and save the country.</p>
<h3>Fourth, Enrich the Economy to Enhance People's Livelihood</h3>
<p>Modern economy takes finance as the core of its activities, and modern politics also takes finance as the key to public finance. Today, when the national economic structure of our country is not yet sound, it is suffering great oppression from industrialized countries around the world. From rural areas to cities, all are falling into the disaster of bankruptcy. That is why we must make the greatest determination and implement financial controls. However, the people must know that the reason why the country is making the greatest determination to implement this unprecedented policy is to save us from the current great disaster. As for the future, true economic construction can only be achieved by the government and the people working together as one, focusing on the following points: First, establish a system of water management administration, concentrate power, so as to eliminate the long-standing habits of provinces governing themselves, counties planning for themselves, competing with water for land, and competing with land for power, and start the most arduous water management project since Yu the Great, preventing national disaster for a hundred generations and creating national benefit for ten thousand years. Second, develop transportation, which must facilitate the transportation of large quantities of goods, achieve the goals of speed, low cost, and thorough protection, and then it can become a complete transportation network to meet the needs of the national economy and the people's livelihood. The construction of freight transportation is even more difficult than the construction of intellectual transportation and human transportation, and must be carried out with the full efforts of the entire country. Third, encourage agriculture, reclaim wasteland, create forests, develop mineral resources, reward animal husbandry, and encourage the fishing industry, taking into account the seasons, the land's advantages, and the suitability of human affairs, distinguishing between the basics and the details, the light and the heavy, the urgent and the slow, so that all undertakings are beneficial to the whole country without harming the local areas, and are beneficial to a hundred generations without harming the present. Fourth, revitalize industry. All undertakings that are of great importance to national and people's well-being should be state-owned in principle. All state-owned enterprises should emphasize both the reorganization of existing enterprises and the establishment of new enterprises. At the same time, with regard to general industry, efforts should be made to eliminate the harm of competing with the people for profit, and provide active support and protection, coordinate labor-capital relations, and help its development. Fifth, establish a land administration system, complete measurement, stipulate land prices, adjust land distribution, promote land use activities and land finance, in order to increase agricultural production and seek equal land rights, and realize the principles of the People's Livelihood. Sixth, promote compulsory labor, restore our country's good practice of social cooperation, reorganize local industries, develop preliminary construction, use it as a means of educating the people through labor, and achieve the purpose of rescuing the people's livelihood. Seventh, establish accounting policies, strictly audit, unify the monetary system, and regulate finance, in order to support the people's strength, enrich national use, facilitate the circulation of goods, and cultivate the nation's vitality.</p>
<h3>Fifth, Be Cautious in Selection, Strict in Examination, to Establish the Basis for National Personnel Administration</h3>
<p>To ensure that everything is done, it is necessary to make the best use of people's talents. At the beginning of the revolution, everything was newly created, and the way of cultivation was not easy to be perfect, and the method of demotion and promotion was difficult to be strict and orderly. Now that the National Government has been established for ten years, all national construction requires a large number of specialized talents, and administrative organs at all levels must have suitable and qualified officials who are committed to public service and duty, so as to improve administrative efficiency. If the path to luck is not blocked for a day, the sigh of depression cannot be relieved for a day. If the habit of following the old ways is not reformed for a long time, then diligent and capable people will have no way to encourage themselves. The cycle corresponds, and the national strength and human resources both suffer losses. How can the difficult situation be overcome? Therefore, the completion of the examination and appraisal system and the strict implementation of the civil servant performance appraisal are urgently needed. Generally speaking, there are three points that are particularly important: First, complete the application of the appointment system. The independence of the appointment system is the unique feature of our country. The so-called rule of man in our country is actually based on the establishment of a strict personnel system as its key element. From the ancient Heavenly Official to the Ministry of Personnel in the late Qing Dynasty, although the names are different, they are all ranked at the top of the hundreds of officials, in charge of personnel throughout the country. Now, although the Ministry of Appointment has been established, the completion of the system is still far away. In order to recruit talents and increase the efficiency of administration and construction, it is appropriate to gradually reduce the power of exceptions in the evolution of the times, so that the virtuous have the opportunity to offer themselves and the capable have the hope of guarantee. This requires the concerted efforts of the whole country, the central government, and the local governments, in order to achieve its effectiveness. Second, fully utilize the effectiveness of the examination system. Since ancient times, examinations and schools have become an inseparable and consistent system. This is also true today, but the system cannot be fully integrated, and the guidelines cannot be consistent. The three major guidelines of the Premier, "education is well-guided, encouragement is appropriate, and appointment is done properly," have not yet been fully implemented. In the future, we must follow the teachings of the Premier, inherit the spirit of China's inherent system, explore the strengths of various countries, and adapt to modern needs, in order to establish a good and complete political system and seek the mutual connection of the three procedures of cultivation, examination, and appointment. This also requires the concerted efforts of the central and local governments. Third, strictly implement the performance appraisal of civil servants at all levels. Since the establishment of the National Government, in order to expedite government affairs, it has set a certain period of time to urge its completion. Evidenced by the established rules of modern emerging families, this method should be the most effective promotion. However, after a long period of implementation, the sincerity of many years of compliance has turned into the habit of deception. This conference believes that the completion of all national construction is the key to survival and success, and specially passed the principle that civil servants who delay national affairs should be punished, and expects the government to issue a clear order to make officials at all levels uplift themselves, so as to promote the rapid completion of all urgent and important projects.</p>
<h3>Sixth, Respect the Judiciary and Reduce Public Burden, to Emphasize the People's Rights to Life and Property</h3>
<p>The new judicial system was implemented in our country the earliest among the new policies. Because education is ineffective and old habits cannot correspond to the new system, although good laws have been promulgated, good intentions have not been shown. Now, if we want to gradually move towards constitutional harmony, we must comply with the people's feelings and improve the folk customs. To promote justice, we must complete the independence of the judicial system, pay attention to the procedures for appointing judges, promote the mediation system, implement the policy of moral influence, cultivate the people's virtue of abiding by the law, and foster a simple social atmosphere, so that there are no backlogged cases and no grievances among the people, and achieve the goal of no punishment. As for the protection of underage children and released prisoners, it is even more important to rectify people's hearts and cultivate good customs. All of these should be implemented immediately. There are two points: First, the greatest purpose of the judicial system is to protect the people, and facilitating the people is the first priority of protecting the people. We must do our best to carefully consider the harmony between the system itself and the implementation method, so as to reduce the people's loss of time and economic burden, and relieve the people's actual pain. Therefore, prudence and speed are also the most important guidelines for improving the judiciary in the future. Second, in ancient times, our country considered it good governance to have lenient politics and lenient punishment. In today's world, in order to reduce backlog, we have no choice but to use the number of cases handled as a standard for rewards, and the drawbacks that arise from this are beyond the initial plan. How to achieve the effect of no backlog of cases, and at the same time achieve the goal of reducing sentences and eliminating public burden, is what the government should do its best to achieve in the future.</p>
<h3>Seventh, Emphasize Supervision and Encourage Censors to Purify Officialdom and Extend Public Opinion</h3>
<p>Examinations are used to recruit the virtuous, and supervision is used to impeach those who have failed in their duties. They complement each other in promoting the progress of public affairs and increasing the actual effect of administration. At this time when everything is waiting to be done, the first priority is to rectify officialdom. Therefore, the current key is to respect the independence of the supervisory power and protect the exercise of the supervisory power, so that the censors fulfill their duty to speak out, and the government receives the effect of self-encouragement. Only when the country has no officials who violate the law and derelict their duties can the people have faith in abiding by the law and loving the country. There are two main points: First, the Premier knew that the methods of knowing people and the rule of law are mutually connected and inseparable. Therefore, he established the five-power constitution, one to restore the prosperity of the ancient system and one to complement the beauty of the new system. The independence of the supervisory power among the five powers, on the one hand, has the body of the examination power with the succession before and after, and on the other hand, has the use of the judicial power with the maintenance of the left and right. Taking the soundness of the legislative power as its cause and the soundness of the administrative power as its effect, it is necessary to know how to divide labor and cooperate to complete the government's structure, so as to receive the great effect of the five-power system. Looking at the present and learning from the past, we should seek to expand its role and fully exert its function. Second, the system of Imperial Censor originated from the historians. The great righteousness of the Spring and Autumn Annals is its principle. Therefore, those who block speech are not guilty, and those who hear it should be warned. Since ancient times, the origins of censors have had the strictest regulations. Although they are the same as officials in important positions, their solemnity is respected by everyone. Therefore, they can get the benefit of knowing to love themselves without speaking. If our country's five-power constitutional system is to be respected and emulated by all countries in the world, then the government must do its best to enrich the supervisory system and apply it appropriately.</p>
<h3>Eighth, Emphasize Border Affairs, Expedite Education, to Consolidate the Nation and Achieve Unification</h3>
<p>In order to implement the Premier's teachings on nationalism and respond to the country's current environment, it is necessary to support the cultural and economic development of all ethnic groups in the country, cultivate their social and family autonomy, respect their religious beliefs and the advantages of their social organizations, in order to consolidate the unity of the country and enhance the unity of the nation. The fundamental implementation guidelines are as follows: First, for all ethnic groups in the border areas and in the southwestern provinces, the premise of all policy guidelines is to benefit the local indigenous people first. The previous congresses have repeatedly made solemn resolutions, which must be earnestly followed. Second, in the future, representatives elected by the Mongolian, Tibetan, Xinjiang Hui, and other ethnic groups scattered in the interior must have a real registered residence in the local area, so as to fully express the feelings of the people of all ethnic groups. Third, the central government should earnestly formulate appropriate plans and strive to develop education for the above-mentioned ethnic groups in various places. The state must provide ample funding and establish budgets for the education of all ethnic groups. Fourth, regarding the economic construction of the above-mentioned areas, a conservation policy should be adopted for their original industries and skills, and efforts should be made to gradually improve them so that the people can directly benefit. Fifth, the government should cultivate talents from the border areas so that various central agencies can fully employ people from the border areas to gather ideas and broaden benefits, and strengthen the power of true unity.</p>
<h3>Ninth, Open Constitutional Governance, Revise Internal Administration, to Establish a Solid Foundation for the Republic of China</h3>
<p>The foundation of nation-building is to gather the combined strength of the people and seek the true well-being of the people. Therefore, on the one hand, we should cultivate civil rights, and on the other hand, we should supervise and encourage civil affairs. The two functions are mutually related. Although our country's tutelage work has not been completed due to continuous years of disturbances, and it is premature to speak of constitutional governance, the irrigation of the Three Principles of the People has indeed become popular throughout the country, so it is necessary to create a constitution and create a shared code of conduct, gather the strength of the people, and promote the realization of local self-government. Responding to the situation is a necessary plan. This conference believes that the National Assembly should be convened within a limited time period, so that the people know that they bear the responsibility of national affairs. At the same time, we must revise internal administration, follow the provisions of the Outline of National Reconstruction, intensify the supervision and promotion of the early completion of local self-government, and cultivate a solid foundation for civil rights. That is, to create the common strength of the whole country, what must be promoted and vigorously implemented is as follows: First, the National Assembly must be convened within the 25th year of the Republic. The draft constitution must also be carefully revised to make it more perfect. On the one hand, we should still follow the Outline of National Reconstruction and the provisions of the Local Self-Government Implementation Act, carefully consider the actual situation in various places, separately formulate procedures, and earnestly supervise officials at all levels and awaken the people to work together to complete the basic work of self-government. Second, the reorganization and enrichment of internal affairs administration is what the government should pay attention to first. The essence of the Premier's creation is that the county is the unit of local self-government, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the central government is actually the general pivot, and the implementation items of the Outline of National Reconstruction are the basis for the construction of various constructions in the Founding Strategy. All important administrations such as the country's military, political, financial, educational, transportation, and industrial affairs are based on internal affairs administration. Moreover, conscription, labor conscription, land survey, water management, encouraging agriculture, and even developing local self-government, supporting people's self-defense, and completing the Baojia organization are all key points of internal affairs administration. In the future, if we want to create a balanced and developed country and undertake extraordinary undertakings, the internal affairs administration must enrich its functions and improve its organization so that it can fully exert its due responsibilities. Third, implement the principle of balanced power distribution, determine the boundaries between the central and local governments, so that the political efficiency of various provinces and regions can be fully exerted, give them considerable power, give them due convenience, and enable them to adapt to local conditions and develop rapidly and effectively. Fourth, protect freedom of speech to express public opinion and unify public will. The management of speech, writing, and publication must be carefully improved, actively guided, so that in the free development, they will all tend towards a uniform and healthy path. Before the promulgation of the constitution, the rights of the people should also be protected according to the Provisional Constitution of the Tutelage Period.</p>
<h3>Tenth, Respectfully Follow the Premier's Teachings, Restore National Self-Confidence, Establish Proper Foreign Relations, to Maintain the Dignity of National Independence and Equality, and Achieve the Goal of World Harmony</h3>
<p>Our country, as the most ancient civilization, has declined and fallen into the position of a semi-colony. The Premier devoted himself to the revolution to save China from danger and destruction. In his lectures on nationalism, what he warned us about was said for fear of not being fully expressed. As for now, we have encountered an unprecedented national crisis, and the people of the country are sad and angry, and are willing to do their best to seek a bright way out for the country. We believe that since the composition of China's country was not caused by one day or one night, to seek the way to self-rescue and national salvation, we can only seek it from the Premier's legacy, which was known decades ago. Therefore, first, we should recognize that the national movement advocated by the Premier actually includes two meanings: seeking freedom and equality externally, and seeking self-reliance and self-improvement internally, and the latter is the inevitable effort by which the former is achieved. This is what we should earnestly reflect on and strive to catch up with. Second, the determination of international relations should be based on the destiny of the entire country and the permanent interests of the nation, and should not be swayed by temporary changes and emotional ties. As the citizens of China today, we have obligations to the country and the world, and responsibilities to our ancestors and future generations. Therefore, today, we must uphold our inherent virtue of impartiality, and with the spirit of fearlessness and without doubt, weigh the long-term and correct interests of the country, so as to make decisions. Understanding the laws of cause and effect and the meaning of human determination to overcome nature, we must devote ourselves to self-help and self-rescue. Thirdly, it should be known that during this period of national transformation, the construction of the country has not yet been completed, the changes in the world are still in full swing, and unexpected obstacles cannot be foreseen. Therefore, we must establish a common and firm belief in completing the central and basic work of the country and do our best to remove obstacles in order to achieve completion. At the same time, we should entrust the central government with the power to respond to emergencies and guarantee the survival and interests of the country, and listen to its commands in unison. Today, we can only seek our own survival by striving for self-reliance. We are also willing to maintain our national nature of respecting peace and mutual assistance, and to seek coexistence with all countries in the world. We do not want to lean towards any country, nor do we want to harm any country. Because our China has had a noble and great international morality for thousands of years, which has been consistently adhered to throughout the ages. To continue the interrupted world, to lift the abolished and govern the chaotic, and to hold the dangerous, and to pay tribute in a timely manner, with generous gifts and meager returns, are all based on the consistent path of sincerity, righteousness, cultivation, family, governance, and peace, which has long been believed and practiced by mankind in order to achieve the goal of world harmony. The reason why we are revolutionizing and striving for self-reliance, self-improvement, restoring national status, and national freedom and equality is to make those who stand on their own feet to help others, and those who are self-educated can advance and teach the world's great evils. Looking at the great sacrifices after the European War and its results, which are contrary to what the great powers expected, we can know that the ultimate principle by which China was able to unite thousands of states into one country and hundreds of millions of people into one body three thousand years ago must be followed by those who have countries in the world. We do not want to rely on lofty ideals to relax our real struggle, but we will not temporarily lose our self-confidence because of the dangerous and difficult situation at the moment. As we are in this critical period of national crisis, what we hold to deal with the crisis is to uphold the Premier's two great teachings of "human determination will overcome nature" and "what is in our own hands will survive, and what is in the hands of others will perish," and with the greatest patience and determination, guarantee the survival of our country and the revival of our nation. When peace has not yet reached complete despair, we will never give up peace. When the country has reached the point where sacrifice is inevitable, we will surely sacrifice ourselves and be determined to make the final sacrifice. We will make the greatest efforts for peace, and with sincerity and determination, turn the tide of the situation and achieve the goal of self-reliance and self-existence, and work together with the countries of the world to achieve the realization of world harmony. This is the greatest duty of the Chinese people in this period, and what the people of the country should believe and practice together. The above-mentioned points are the key plans for building the country and saving the country, and also the premise for uniting the people to work together. Other plans for political, military, economic, and educational efforts in the future, such as the cultivation of people's strength and material resources, and the rapid suppression of bandits who endanger the country, have already been resolved and will not be repeated. Today's events have no distinction between treating the symptoms and treating the root cause, and must be efforts made at the same time. All that has been revealed in the previous text, whether it is a basic matter or encompasses a wide range, cannot be expected to be achieved overnight, but we must immediately catch up. Truly, the life of one period is extended by the life of millions of years, and the unshakable foundation of thousands of years of history is accumulated by the efforts of countless people. We live in the world today, at this critical moment of survival and death. Above, we must maintain the glorious history of our nation, and below, we must build a magnificent cause that will last for ten thousand generations for the people. This responsibility of carrying on the past and opening up the future has been placed on the shoulders of our national compatriots, and our party comrades are the vanguards and strong soldiers. Since ancient times, great and magnificent national construction plans must arise from the deep awakening of the people and the real efforts of the whole country in extremely difficult times, and then there will be far-reaching achievements. Truly, if everyone in the country has the ambition to stand tall and support the crisis, and firmly believes that China will become a prosperous and happy country, then if humanity does not perish, then truth will not perish, and the glory of our Republic of China and the spirit of thousands of years of national history will last forever with the world. May our compatriots throughout the country, with this belief, be loyal and brave, and with one heart and one mind, work together to achieve it. (Central News Agency Telegraph on the 23rd)</p>

<p>Adoption of the Fourth Party Affairs Report</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At the seventh session of the Fifth National Congress on the 23rd, resolutions were passed. (1) The resolution of the Party Affairs Group on the report of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees: The Congress listened to the Party Affairs Report of the Fourth Central Executive and Supervisory Committees. After careful review, it was deeply aware that during these four years, comrades of the Party were almost constantly in arduous struggle. In addition to being moved, the Congress carefully examined and criticized the key points. In recent years, the national crisis has been severe, and worries have been intertwined. Comrades of the Central Committee, with the determination to accept orders in times of danger, made every effort to cope. After the outbreak of the Shanghai War, as the capital was deeply threatened, the capital was moved to Luoyang, and the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee was held to determine the strategy of national salvation and survival. A National Crisis Conference was convened to discuss ways to achieve internal peace and external resistance. After the end of the Shanghai War, Rehe fell into enemy hands. The Great Wall Resistance War failed to achieve success. Inevitably, the painful decision was made to cease fire. At the Fourth Meeting of this Congress, Comrade Chiang Kai-shek reported on foreign relations, stating that peace should not be abandoned until all hope is lost, and sacrifice should not be lightly spoken of until the final moment. He also stated that, limited to not infringing on sovereignty, coordinated policies should be sought among friendly nations, and economic cooperation should be sought among friendly nations on the principle of mutual benefit and equality. The Congress deeply believed that the points mentioned by Comrade Chiang were the overall policy of the Central Committee in coping with the national crisis in recent years and considered them to be beyond reproach. However, the great disaster of the future is just beginning. The Party, aware of the earnest expectations of the people of the country, should further adhere to the plan of self-reliance and revival in the midst of hardship and danger. First, the Red bandits are a major scourge of national revival. The previous Congress passed a resolution to suppress the Red bandits. The Fourth Central Committee devoted all its efforts to this, entrusting Comrade Chiang Kai-shek to lead the troops to encircle and suppress the bandits many times. Finally, the bandits' nests were destroyed, and the major scourge was eliminated. The remnants of the bandits fled to the border areas of Guizhou, Yunnan, Sichuan, and Gansu, where they were repeatedly hit hard. The Congress deeply commended Comrade Chiang for not hesitating to endure hardships and quell internal troubles, and for the unity of all the Central Committee comrades in striving for security. However, remnants still remain in the Shaanxi and Gansu areas, which should be quickly eliminated to stabilize the border areas and eliminate the scourge. The people have been in dire straits for years, and efforts should be made to resettle refugees and relieve disaster victims as soon as possible, so that construction projects can proceed gradually. Second, the Fourth National Congress stated that the foundation of modern nation-building lies in the consolidation of unity and the enrichment of national strength, and especially relies on the people's determination to be courageous and diligent, to stand together and seek its realization. The Fourth Central Committee, based on this program, although struggling with affairs, has enabled the Party comrades to tend towards unity, resulting in today's grand meeting. This is enough to show that the foundation of unity has been consolidated. In recent years, the government has spared no effort in production and construction, national education, innovation and improvement. The promotion of the New Life Movement has been particularly successful. Therefore, both psychological construction and material construction have been enriched equally. As a result, the people of the country have followed suit and unanimously trusted the Party's ideology, which is truly gratifying. In the future, we must continue to adhere to this policy and strive forward to save the nation from its peril and realize its ideology. Third, the Fourth Central Committee can be generally satisfied with the implementation of various tasks in promoting Party affairs. In terms of organization, such as improving the organization of Party branches and methods of activities to make them more flexible, and training lower-level cadres to strengthen forces, all can be effectively carried out and have achieved considerable results. However, the Party's responsibilities are heavy, and the Party's organization should strive to be stricter, reform the past loose state, and ensure flexible operation to improve work efficiency. At the same time, outstanding elements, especially technical talents, should be absorbed into the Party, and existing Party members who lack revolutionary fighting spirit should be eliminated. The Party member code determined by this Congress should be used as a standard to implement training to ensure that both quality and quantity are improved, so that they can shoulder important missions. Secondly, in terms of official communication, such as the guidance of Party newspapers and news agencies, the promotion of literary and artistic movements, and the development of the film industry, all have been quite effective. However, the environment is changing day by day, and propaganda methods should strive to be adapted, especially to correspond to actual political facilities, in order to enlighten social perceptions and increase the people's belief in the Party. As for the mass movement, the Fourth Central Committee specially set up a mass movement guidance committee to take charge of it. In recent years, it has reviewed programs and regulations, reorganized and enriched various people's groups, and made progress in all measures. However, there are still many gaps between Party members and the masses, and the Party's strength has not been deeply rooted among the people. In the future, Party branches in various places must direct Party members to participate in various people's groups and guide them on the road to national revival. The above is a brief review and instruction on the past four years of the Party and the direction of future Party affairs efforts. The Congress schedule is tight, and there is not much time to elaborate. It is hoped that all Party comrades will share the difficulties and strive hard, and that the resolutions of this Congress on Party affairs and politics will be implemented by the Central Committee comrades in the future to lead all Party members to implement them consistently. The Party's future may be bright. Resolution passed. (2) The Declaration Drafting Committee presented the declaration of this Congress. Comrade Dai Chuanxian, the convener, read the full text of the declaration. The entire audience approved it without objection. (3) The Chairman announced that all the proposals of the Congress had also been completed. It is now 5:20 PM. After a five-minute break, the closing ceremony of the Congress will be held. (Central News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Full Text of the Declaration of the Fifth National Congress</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The original text of the declaration of the Fifth National Congress is as follows: The propositions of the Chinese National Revolution, as seen in the teachings of the late President Sun Yat-sen, are: to seek the freedom and equality of China; to build a republic and to advance towards a great harmony; to peacefully and vigorously save China; to unite the 400 million people into a great nation and to build a strong and prosperous nation based on the Three Principles of the People, which is the only way to survive in today's world. It is known that the purpose of the revolution lies only in saving and building the nation. The revolutionary martyrs who followed one another, risking death without hesitation, the comrades of the Party who followed the ideology and struggled for the revolution, and the patriots and benevolent people of the country who are willing to follow the late President's teachings and work together to achieve success, only hope to complete the two major missions of saving and building the nation, to make China consolidate from danger and to carry it forward, and to seek the great harmony of the world by taking steps to establish oneself and establish others. The reason why the Party has taken on such an important task is that it deeply believes that the survival and development of the country and the nation are due to their own hard work and struggle. The revival and reform of any country is also pioneered by a small number of people, and then touches the people of the country to work together towards a unified effort. Recalling the sacrifices of the revolutionary martyrs and the suffering of the compatriots of the country, all this is to achieve this goal. In recent years, we have encountered unprecedented national disasters, and there are many accumulated causes, which are not the result of a day or two. The comrades of the Party are always in awe of the mission left by the late President and the responsibilities that the country should bear, and feel that they cannot bear the burden. Looking around, looking forward to the future, they deeply feel that the Party's shoulders cannot be shirked, and can only awaken the people and fight together based on the late President's teachings that they must continue to work hard. The Fifth National Congress is held today in the face of a serious national crisis. Looking at the changes in the national situation in recent years, examining the way out for our country's survival in the future, and reviewing the past work, we deeply feel that if we do not abandon everything personal today, contribute all our abilities, unite together, and dedicate ourselves to the country, the revolutionary cause will be in danger of being interrupted, and the nation's future will be unimaginable. Furthermore, it is seen that in recent years, the compatriots of the country, in extreme difficulty and suffering, have a deeper understanding of the late President's proposition of revolutionary national salvation, and their spirit of working together to overcome the national crisis is also deepening day by day, believing that the bright hope for the country's future lies in this nationally consistent awakening. Therefore, they are inspired, concentrate their strength, and carefully consider the national plan, believing that although national salvation and national construction are different in terms of root and branch and priority, in China today, without their own hard struggle, a thorough and fundamental awakening, restoring the national spirit, tracing modern progress, and establishing a modern country in which both human and material resources are developed and enriched, it is impossible to overcome the difficulties of the environment and consolidate the country. In order to obtain this opportunity to build the country, any sacrifice should not be spared in striving for self-reliance. Indeed, self-humiliation and humiliation of others is a clear lesson from the past. The decline and danger of the country did not come about without cause, and its recovery from adversity and revival from difficulties cannot be achieved by luck. Any nation in the world, when it conceives the function of new life, often goes through extremely dangerous and difficult stages, and its final success in overcoming difficulties is always due to the determination of surviving death many times. To undertake a grand and great cause, this Congress, in view of the lessons of such history, is willing to show the compatriots of the country the significance of working together for national salvation and national construction, and to strive together with the same morality and the same heart. It has listed seven important plans, which are related to building the country and saving the country, and presented them to our compatriots in detail. Continued on page five.</p>

<h3>Sir Arthur Salter to Arrive in Beiping Today; Met with Press at the British Consulate in Tianjin Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Sir Arthur Salter is scheduled to arrive in Beiping from Tianjin on the 24th. Business and banking circles in Beiping are preparing a grand welcome and have invited economic experts and famous scholars from Beiping to hold a symposium. Salter will stay in Beiping for about two or three weeks and plans to draft a survey report in Beiping.

<p>(Tianjin) Sir Arthur Salter visited Nankai University at 4:00 PM on the 23rd, and a symposium was held by the Dean of the School of Economics, He Lian, Professor Huang Zijian, Zhang Pengchun, and Fan Xudong, the manager of Jiuda Refined Salt Company.

He originally planned to visit South China, but he was afraid that there would not be enough time, so he had to cancel the trip. He may take the road through Japan on his return trip. After coming to China, he paid attention to various economic matters and met with financial, industrial, and economic experts in Shanghai many times, which increased many things he wanted to hear. The purpose of this trip to the north is the same as that in Shanghai. The future of China's economy is very promising. Recently, China's currency reform, from a personal observation, is very reasonable, because if a country can unify its currency, it will be beneficial to the development of the economy and industry. Now is not the time to talk about Sino-British economic cooperation. We should pay attention to mutual trade and mutual assistance between the two countries, which will benefit both. If a country's economic system is good, its friendly countries will also benefit from it. As a result, cooperation will naturally occur even without mentioning it. (Special dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<h3>The Entire Jiangxi Money Industry Borrows Money: Promoting Acceptance Bills</h3>
<p>The Central Bank allocates 1 million in loans as a bill fund to rescue dying industry and commerce, prevent collapses, and expand</p>
<p>Nanchang communication. The Jiangxi economy is exhausted. The decline in production and purchasing power is nearing its end. The market is depressed, as was only seen after the collapse of Jiangxi Bank for ten million yuan in the 15th year of the Republic of China and the large-scale disruption by the communists in the 16th year. The two years end is approaching in a flash. The merchants' loans from the money houses cannot be repaid, and they hope to continue to borrow to maintain the status quo. Money houses are afraid to force debtors too much, lest they go bankrupt, so they are still throwing rats to avoid hitting the dishes. However, money houses have limited capital, and they all pretend to have ten or twenty times their capital to deal with depositors withdrawing money, so they are naturally lacking in the art of turning stone into gold. Therefore, since the 4th of this month, the money houses can only cope with appearances, receiving but not paying out. Even a withdrawal of 1,000 yuan can only be refused, and the financial market is completely paralyzed. After research by the financial community and various business groups, it is proposed to follow the Shanghai method of promoting acceptance bills, discounted by banks, to facilitate turnover. Regarding the fund aspect, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Clearing House, and the Money Industry Association jointly telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, ordering the Central Bank to allocate 6 million yuan in legal tender, and Finance Commissioner Wu personally went to Beijing to explain to President Kong the dire and urgent situation in the province and request approval. Wu telegraphed the province from Beijing yesterday, saying that the Central Bank would allocate 1 million for this loan, but the entire financial community must be responsible. After receiving the telegram, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce convened an emergency meeting of the Clearing House and the Money Industry Association on the 19th. More than 70 people from the money industry, including Yu Jianchen, from the Clearing House, Lu Fuchuang, from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Xu Ruifu, etc., attended the meeting, which lasted for two hours. At the meeting, it was resolved that (1) the 37 member stores of the Money Industry Association would bear joint and several liability for the loan from the Central Bank; (2) after the loan arrives, the Finance Department and the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Yu Min Bank, one person each, and the Clearing House six people, would form a review committee. Borrowers must first submit an application, and the loan will only be approved after passing the review. The decision was telegraphed back to Finance Commissioner Wu to inform the Central Bank.</p>
<p>Regarding the approval of this loan, it is the same as the Shanghai small-loan relief for industry and commerce. The method is the discounting of acceptance bills. For example, if a money house lends money to a certain merchant firm, and the merchant firm has indeed has goods and property, and cannot repay the discounted loan upon maturity, the merchant firm can issue a bill, which is handed over to the money house and guaranteed, and then the money house discounts the bill with the Yu Min Bank. This discount is to facilitate the turnover of the financial and industrial sectors, and to take care of both at the same time. Also, because the money houses in the city are unable to take care of themselves, all industries are unable to prepare for the year-end closing and the opening of business next year, so they are in a precarious situation. If there is no overall relief method, the momentum of collapses will be uncontrollable. All merchants are now trying to tighten their belts, so the rent reduction movement is rising, and the number of unemployed shop assistants next year will surely increase exponentially. (20th)</p>
<h3>Tidbits of Science</h3>
<p>— Edited by the Science Society of China</p>
<p>The Application of Psychology　Xiao Xiaorong</p>
<p>Psychology and Daily Life — Psychology and Education —</p>
<p>Psychology and Mental Hygiene — Psychology and Industry —</p>
<p>Psychology and Medicine — Psychology and Law — Psychology and Military Affairs</p>
<p>Our goal in studying psychology is to predict and control human behavior. In daily life, there are countless instances of predicting and controlling behavior. For example, people prefer to deposit money in a certain bank because they predict that the bank is reliable. When collaborating with someone on a business venture, it is necessary to establish a contract. This is to control each other's behavior. Similarly, teachers hold small quizzes every week. This is to control students' reading behavior each week. We might even say that almost all behavior contains the meaning of prediction and control, so this interest in predicting and controlling behavior is not only naturally generated but also indispensable. The goal of psychology is to enable us to understand the causal relationships of behavior so that we can be more confident when predicting or controlling behavior.</p>
<p>Psychology has the most connections with daily life. In general, when people do things, they are satisfied as long as they can get by; therefore, their abilities cannot be developed to their full potential. There are also many people who want to receive sufficient training in activities involving skills but cannot achieve this goal. There are also many people who always seek perfection in their ability to use language but cannot perfect it. There are also many unnecessary wastes of time and energy in many daily tasks. All these problems require the knowledge and principles of psychology to solve.</p>
<p>The application of psychology in education has been generally recognized. The development of intelligence is not only dominated by genetic factors but also by environmental factors. How must we construct an environment to allow children to have the most appropriate development in intelligence? This is certainly a topic in education, but it is fundamentally a problem in psychology. We must have sufficient knowledge in psychology to determine how children should develop, how education should adapt to children's needs, and how education should affect children's future.</p>
<p>The relationship between psychology and mental hygiene is also very important. A person's personality is easily susceptible to corrupting influences. A healthy personality relies on a balance of likes and dislikes, appropriate satisfaction of natural impulses, and a correct understanding of social and economic values. Psychology can make many contributions to the cultivation of personality. Its application in this area is what is called "mental hygiene."</p>
<p>The application of psychology in industry has made considerable progress in European and American countries, and is most developed especially in Germany and Russia. In terms of factories, there is a great deal of waste due to management personnel not adapting the work environment to the workers but forcing the workers to adapt to the work environment, or due to the misuse of workers without selecting the good from the bad. If industrial psychology methods are applied, these wastes can be reduced significantly. The sales of goods depend not only on the quality of the goods but also on the way the sales personnel interact with customers. If sales personnel have sufficient knowledge in applied psychology, they will know how to interact with customers to be effective. Advertising is also a method of sales. Many psychological principles must be applied in advertising, such as the arrangement of materials, the choice of topics, and the depiction of illustrations all contain psychological problems.</p>
<p>The control of human nature is also very important in the direction of medicine. In the past, it was thought that the doctor's job was only to see patients and prescribe medicine, but this erroneous view has long been changed. The materials that doctors deal with cannot be said to be entirely a chemical compound, which must be changed by drugs; his patients mostly need a suitable hospital atmosphere. In this atmosphere, the doctor's confident attitude is the most important. Many patients can only take medicine effectively when they have considerable faith, and some patients only need a change in emotional habits rather than medication. These points can all show the relationship between psychology and medicine.</p>
<p>Those who judge must know the psychology of crime and the psychology of evidence to reduce their errors. Lawyers must interact with their litigants, judges, and jurors. Therefore, they must always observe their characteristics. When he speaks to the jury in front of the judge, and when he questions the witnesses, he must try to influence their attitude. His success or failure depends on the influence he exerts. This shows the importance of psychology in law.</p>
<p>In military affairs, psychology can also make important contributions. For example, "leading soldiers" and "leading generals" are issues of psychological control. Military personnel selection and military training include problems of prediction and control. The ancients said, "Taking the hearts of men before they take yours," "A single drum stirs the spirit, a second weakens it, a third exhausts it," and so on, all of which have long recognized the importance of psychological principles in military affairs. Military psychology has already made great progress. This psychology is what our country urgently needs to apply now.</p>

<p>The Boundary Between East and West is Broken</p>
<h3>Pacific Airmail Service Opens: 100,000 People Cheer as the "China Clipper" Takes Off; U.S. to Far East in 5 Days; First Batch of Mail Exceeds Two Tons; International Understanding and Trade Made More Convenient</h3>
<p>Alameda, California. The Pacific regular airmail service officially opened today. The large aircraft "China Clipper," loaded with approximately 100,000 letters, took off from the San Francisco Bay at 3:46 PM, flying to Honolulu, Midway Island, Wake Island, Guam, and finally to Manila. The takeoff ceremony was very solemn. The entire nation listened to the broadcast program. Postmaster General Farley was the main speaker. He first officially read President Roosevelt's congratulatory message, followed by stating that the opening of the new air route will shorten the journey between the Far East and the United States to five days. It is expected that our friendship and commerce with the Far East will be further consolidated as a result. The airmail service between Europe and America is expected to be established within 18 months. Philippine's newly elected President Quezon made a broadcast speech in Manila, saying that this new industry is enough to open a new era. Honolulu, Midway Island, Wake Island, Guam, and Manila all sent telegrams reporting that preparations were complete. Upon the final order, the aircraft left the water and soared into the sky, flying eastward. The pilot of the aircraft is the same person who piloted the "Oriental" on the four trial flights across the Pacific. (22nd National Telegram)</p>
<p>(San Francisco) The "China Clipper," a 25-ton large flying boat of Pan American Airways, departed from Alameda today for the first regular airmail service across the Pacific. Up to 100,000 people cheered it off. The aircraft carried two tons of mail. As it took off, it resembled a giant bird. The silver-white hull was especially dazzling in the sunlight. The military band played national music after the flying boat ascended to celebrate. The flying boat circled once in the sky above the Golden Gate, with no less than 30,000 spectators. Then the aircraft flew directly to Honolulu, which is the first stop on the way from the United States to Manila. During the takeoff ceremony, Postmaster General Farley read President Roosevelt's congratulatory telegram and predicted that regular flights between New York and China would only take six days, which was something unimaginable in the past. Philippine President Quezon also sent a congratulatory telegram, roughly saying that the boundary between East and West has been broken, and international trade, understanding, and peace will be made more convenient. The dawn of a new era has begun. The aircraft has seven navigators. This time it only carries mail and no passengers, but it is hoped that it will carry passengers within two months. The aircraft carries as much as two tons of mail, which has never happened before. The "China Clipper" is equipped with four engines, flying in the sky at a speed of 150 miles per hour for 32 hours. The distance it flies is 3,500 miles. From San Francisco to Manila, it is 8,000 miles. The first stop is Honolulu, which is 2,400 miles. The second stop is Midway Island, which is 1,380 miles. The third stop is Wake Island, which is 1,248 miles. The fourth stop is Guam, which is 1,450 miles. After flying another 1,500 miles, it reaches the final destination, Manila.

<h3>Britain and the United States Have the Same Opinions on the Far East and Will Surely Succeed</h3>
<p>(Washington) Observers here have expressed their opinions on the international situation, believing that Britain and the United States have the same opinions on opposing the Italian-Ethiopian war and upholding peace in the Far East, and will surely succeed. (22nd Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) Regarding Japan's actions in North China, Secretary of State Hull had a meeting with British Ambassador to the United States Lindsay the night before. Diplomatic circles attach great importance to this conversation, but there is no definite indication of what attitude the U.S. government will take on the North China issue. (22nd Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) It is rumored that U.S. Secretary of State Hull and British Ambassador to the United States Lindsay mentioned the possibility of imposing economic sanctions on Japan during their talks in New York. Officials here firmly deny this. (22nd Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Announces: No Increase in Warships Next Year; Naval Personnel to Be Increased</h3>
<p>Hot Springs, USA. President Roosevelt indicated today that the next year's budget will stipulate an increase in the number of U.S. Navy personnel, approximately 4,000, bringing the total to 100,000. The Marine Corps will increase by 1,000, bringing the total to 17,000. No new battleships are included in the budget. The increase in personnel is due to the fact that new destroyers require more people than older ships. (23rd National Telegram)</p>
<h3>The U.S. Also Prevents Raw Materials from Being Supplied to Warring Nations; Cargo Ships Are Still Blocked from Sailing</h3>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. government has now taken important actions to prevent raw materials from being supplied to warring nations. The Shipping Bureau sent a letter to various shipping companies, informing them that shipping raw materials to warring nations is contrary to government policy. Although the Shipping Bureau did not make threats to suspend subsidies, it is heard that shipowners who lease ships to carry goods and trade with warring nations will be subject to considerable punishment. According to reports, this letter from the Shipping Bureau was issued because several cargo ships are currently fully loaded with raw materials and plan to go to the war zone. (22nd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of the Interior and Oil Commissioner Ickes demanded that oil merchants stop selling oil to warring nations, and Secretary of State Hull's statement yesterday that only politicians and privileged classes protected by tariffs oppose the U.S.-Canada reciprocal trade agreement has fully clarified the government's policy. The policy can be summarized as follows: (1) Encourage American merchants to refrain from trading with warring nations, thereby curbing the war. (2) Maintain friendship with peaceful nations and encourage trade with practical methods, such as universally reducing artificial trade barriers. Hull also stated that the situation forces the United States to restore foreign markets, otherwise the country must abandon the idea of selling its surplus goods. (22nd National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to informed sources, the government will put pressure on all shipping companies that receive subsidies from the Federal Shipping Administration to prevent them from transporting goods to the warring nations of Italy and Ethiopia. It is also heard that several crude oil tankers were originally scheduled to sail from New Orleans to Italy but have now postponed their departure. According to reports, the cargo ships owned by these companies have been mortgaged to the government. The government only needs to refuse to renew the term to make them comply. (22nd Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(New York) Representatives of the nation's major oil companies were unwilling to discuss trade with Italy today but generally felt that Secretary of the Interior Ickes's request that companies stop transporting crude oil to Italy was unreasonable and hindered their interests. It is said that the implementation of sanctions against Italy was initiated by Britain, but British companies are still selling kerosene to Italy. (22nd National Telegram)</p>
<p>San Pedro. The cargo ship "Oregon" ignored Secretary of State Hull's warning and loaded 36,000 barrels of aviation fuel today and set sail for Italian Somaliland. The sailors on the ship do not belong to the union. Although the ship offered a 50% wage increase, people in the union were unwilling to work on the ship. As a result, the ship was delayed in Los Angeles for about a week. The leader of the maritime union telegraphed the President, stating that the union would not be willing to go to Italian Somaliland unless the State Department guaranteed the complete protection of the crew. However, the State Department did not make any criticism of this matter after receiving the telegram. (22nd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Italy Does Not Participate in Two League of Nations Meetings, Expressing Determination to Resist Sanctions</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Italy has decided not to participate in the two meetings of the League of Nations to be held on November 25. Italy's determination to boycott the League of Nations when sanctions are implemented can be seen from this. Italian representative Rocco refused to attend the subcommittee to study the reconstruction of China today. Rocco was supposed to be the chairman of this meeting, but due to his absence, the meeting was postponed. Italy also notified the League of Nations that Italy will also be unable to participate in the International Maritime Conference to be held on November 25 to deal with the issue of seafarers' leave and working hours, because the Italian legislature already has a solution to the issues to be discussed at this conference.

<p>(Rome) Unofficial sources here estimate that Italy has sufficient gasoline reserves to supply the front lines for six months. After six months, Italy hopes to end the East African war. Regarding the warning issued by U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ickes, officials today remained silent, but they were very concerned about the U.S. stance. Observers today generally believe that if Washington succeeds in stopping the shipment of kerosene to Italy, Italy intends to include the United States in its economic retaliation plan.

<h3>Italy Protests Sanctions, British and French Replies Published, Adhering to the Covenant, Negotiations Are Also Useless</h3>
<p>(London) The British and French replies to the Italian government's protest against sanctions were published today. France stated unequivocally that it has no right to reject the League of Nations resolutions. Britain said that reopening negotiations on the issues raised in the Italian note is of no use. According to a Reuters reporter in Rome, Italians were particularly disappointed with the firm tone in the British reply, but this was already expected in Rome. Italians believed that Italy had at least achieved one point, namely that the replies should not be issued jointly. Each government should be responsible for the sanctions it implements. Roman officials were particularly unimpressed by Britain's claim to be fulfilling its obligations under the League of Nations Covenant. They asked, "If that is the case, why did Britain allow Japan to occupy Chinese territory in the past?" The British reply stated that the British government has always been keen to fulfill its obligations in Geneva in a fair spirit, and at the same time is willing to do its utmost to recognize Italy's legitimate interests. Therefore, the British government now feels that reopening negotiations on the issues raised in the Italian note is of no use. Britain's friendship with Italy is strong, and the British government believes that it should support the League of Nations' resolutions and accept the inevitable consequences. As a member of the League of Nations, Britain is eager to facilitate a quick resolution of the dispute. Although the British government upholds the League of Nations Covenant, it does not abandon its own freedom of judgment, but intends to adhere to its obligations under the Covenant. The British government does not hold any other attitude and naturally wishes to see Italy make the same interpretation of its adherence to the Covenant. (23rd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) France's reply to Italy's protest note regarding sanctions has been delivered to the Italian government, stating, "The French government cannot but respond to the opinions put forward by the Italian government. The French government personally participated in the negotiations in Geneva and deeply felt that the Council and Assembly of the League of Nations, on the one hand, considered the gravity of its responsibility to fulfill its international obligations, and on the other hand, did not fail to make the greatest possible concessions to Italy's legitimate interests. All of these were witnessed by the French government." In addition, the main points of the French reply can be divided into the following: (1) The member states attending the Council of the League of Nations have unanimously agreed to recognize that Italy has engaged in war in violation of the League of Nations Covenant. (2) France cannot fail to fulfill its covenant obligations arising from the Italian government's violation of the Covenant. If France does not fulfill these obligations, it will inevitably endanger the principle of collective security. (3) Therefore, France cannot but implement sanctions against Italy from November 18 in accordance with the resolutions of Geneva. However, France's friendship with Italy has always been extremely strong, and France deeply wishes that this friendship can be harmonized with France's obligations to the League of Nations. However, the resolutions of the League of Nations must now be implemented. (22nd Havas Telegram)</p>

<h3>The New Currency System Implemented by the Ministry of Finance - Gao Bingfang, Director of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance (Speech to National Middle School Students and the Public on November 17th)</h3>
<p>In recent years, due to the global economic panic, major countries have adopted managed currency systems. They have centralized the circulating coins in national banks for safekeeping, allowing only banknotes to circulate domestically, in order to control exchange rates and stabilize prices. The effects of this system have been quite significant.</p>
<p>Our country's currency has traditionally been based on silver. Since the increase in silver prices abroad, our silver coins have been greatly affected by the drastic fluctuations in silver prices, resulting in a large outflow. According to statistics from July to mid-October of last year, the amount of silver coins exported reached more than 200 million yuan, which is quite alarming.</p>
<p>Because of the excessive outflow of silver coins, the currency suddenly contracted, leading to a decline in prices and the depression of all industries. Many industries were on the verge of bankruptcy. Although the government took emergency measures at the time, implementing a silver export tax and a balancing tax from October 15th to prevent the outflow of silver, this could only stop it temporarily and was not a fundamental solution. The large difference between domestic and foreign silver prices meant that smuggling silver coins for profit was still frequently heard of. People from all walks of life requested the government to find a way to salvage the crisis. In response to global trends and domestic conditions, the government knew that in order to save ourselves and revive the economy, it was necessary to preserve the currency reserve, which is the lifeblood of the country, in order to achieve permanent stability in currency and finance. After referring to the precedents of modern countries, it promulgated and implemented the legal tender system on the 3rd of this month as an emergency measure, unifying issuance and centralizing reserves with the following six measures. These six measures are: (1) From November 4th of this year, the banknotes issued by the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications are designated as legal tender. All payments for grain, taxes, and all public and private funds shall be made in legal tender only. The use of cash is prohibited, and violators will have all their funds confiscated to prevent the smuggling of silver. Those who deliberately conceal or hide silver with the intention of smuggling it will be punished according to the Emergency Law for Punishing Citizens Who Endanger the People's Livelihood. (2) Banknotes issued by banks other than the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications that have been approved by the Ministry of Finance and are currently in circulation shall be allowed to continue to circulate as usual. The amount of issuance shall be limited to the total amount in circulation as of November 3rd, and no additional issuance shall be allowed. The Ministry of Finance will determine a deadline to gradually exchange them for Central Bank banknotes, and the statutory reserve for the total amount in circulation, together with the newly printed but not yet issued banknotes and the old banknotes that have been issued and recovered, shall be handed over to the Issuance Reserve Management Committee for safekeeping. The new banknotes that are being printed shall also be handed over for safekeeping as soon as they are printed. (3) The safekeeping of the legal tender reserve and the specific matters related to its issuance and exchange shall be handled by the Issuance Reserve Management Committee to ensure reliability and solidify credit. The charter of the committee will be promulgated separately. (4) All silver firms, shops, and other public and private institutions or individuals holding silver standard coins or other silver coins, raw silver, or other silver items shall exchange them for legal tender from November 4th through the Issuance Reserve Management Committee or its designated banks. In addition to exchanging silver standard coins for legal tender at face value, other silver items shall be exchanged according to the actual amount of pure silver they contain. (5) Contracts previously established using silver coin units shall be settled and paid in legal tender at the original amount on the due date. (6) In order to stabilize the exchange rate of the legal tender at its current price, the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications shall buy and sell foreign exchange without restrictions.</p>
<p>The reason why the government resolutely implemented this new system is for the sake of self-preservation. Because after the implementation of this new system, it can revive the economy, stabilize finance, and establish the foundation of the currency system. We can discuss this separately.</p>
<p>First, it is to revive the economy. In recent years, the bankruptcy of the rural economy and the extreme depression of industry and commerce in our country have been due to currency contraction and falling prices. After the implementation of the new system, the centralization of reserves can not only prevent the smuggling of silver coins and eliminate the root cause of currency contraction, but also unify issuance, which will make the effectiveness of banknote circulation more agile and indirectly increase the amount of circulation. At the same time, the need for operating funds for agriculture, industry, and commerce will be easier to obtain, prices can also rise reasonably, and agriculture, industry, and commerce can gradually recover.</p>
<p>Second, it is to stabilize finance. The impact of currency contraction is primarily felt in finance. The unstable state of finance in the past year and a half has been clearly demonstrated. On the other hand, fluctuations in foreign exchange prices further exacerbate financial instability. After the implementation of this new system, the currency will not continue to contract, and it may even become more relaxed. Domestic finance will naturally become more stable. Regarding foreign exchange, it is clearly stipulated that the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications are responsible for unlimited buying and selling, and the price will also be stable, without excessive fluctuations, which can further strengthen the stability of finance.</p>
<p>Third, it is to establish the foundation of the currency system. In our country, in addition to the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, there are other banks issuing banknotes. Although the government has taken great care to prevent and supervise this multi-issuance system, there are inevitably shortcomings. In particular, each bank acts independently, and the increase or decrease in the amount of issuance often runs counter to the needs of financial events and is not conducive to the development of agriculture. People's trust in the use of banknotes is often not as high as that of coins. After the implementation of the new system, it is clearly stipulated that the banknotes of the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications are legal tender. Other banks are not allowed to continue to issue more banknotes. The banknotes that have already been issued will be gradually withdrawn with legal tender within a specified period. In addition, an Issuance Reserve Management Committee is established to manage the issuance reserve and conduct public inspections. Since the issuance has been unified, on the one hand, there is a solid reserve, and on the other hand, due to centralized management, the increase or decrease in the amount of issuance can also meet the needs of agriculture. At the same time, the members of the Management Committee are mostly representatives of the people, and regular inspections can further increase the credit of banknotes and establish the foundation of the currency system. The three points mentioned above are the benefits of implementing the new system.</p>
<p>What needs to be stated here is that this new system is not inflation or a paper money policy. Because inflation is achieved by accelerating issuance, reducing the cash reserve component of banknotes, or reducing the color content of currency. Our new system still maintains the previous reserve system and has not changed it in the slightest. Moreover, it is managed openly. The amount of banknotes issued is matched by the amount of reserves, so it is not inflation.</p>
<p>Why is it said that it is not a paper money policy? The reserve for our legal tender is still the silver standard coin, and its value is no different from that of the silver standard coin. However, in the past, the reserve was managed by the issuing bank itself. Now, it is managed centrally by the Issuance Reserve Management Committee. There is no difference in its essence, and its credit can be further increased, so it is not a paper money policy.</p>
<p>As for our country's vast territory, the interior, and remote areas, the branches of the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications have not yet been widely established. At present, the exchange of legal tender is inevitably a bit difficult. Regarding this, the government had already foreseen it and has telegraphed all provinces and cities, stipulating that areas where legal tender cannot be exchanged may temporarily maintain the original market habits. The three banks are entrusted to various local firms, pawnshops, post offices, railways, shipping bureaus, local tax authorities, county governments, public institutions, and public organizations to collect and exchange legal tender on their behalf. Because post offices are widely established, they can provide even greater convenience to the people by collecting and exchanging legal tender. In addition, in order to have a unified exchange method and facilitate the use of silver by silver product manufacturers, the rules for exchanging legal tender and the rules for managing the use of silver in silver products have been promulgated and implemented separately.</p>
<p>This new system is an unprecedented initiative in our country and a major reform in economic history. The public is inevitably suspicious of this at first. Speculators have taken advantage of this opportunity, causing prices to rise sharply and the exchange rate of banknotes to fall slightly. Now, after officials and industry associations in various places have followed the government's intentions and clearly explained the situation, the people's minds are greatly reassured, and the market has returned to normal. News of this kind is recorded in the newspapers every day and does not need to be described in detail.</p>
<p>What is especially gratifying is that after the implementation of our new system, the British ambassador immediately ordered British merchants to comply and exchange silver for legal tender. The British and American public opinion has also unanimously supported our country's move, and all countries have this tendency, which shows that this new system of the government has won unanimous support from China and foreign countries.</p>
<p>From now on, the government should proceed steadily and pragmatically, while still hoping that the people of the whole country will continue to cooperate so that the government can achieve complete success. That is what the country relies on. (End)</p>

<h3>British Cabinet Reshuffle</h3>
<p>(London) The cabinet reshuffle has been successfully completed and approved by the British monarch. The most important changes are the exchange of positions between Colonial Secretary Malcolm MacDonald and Dominion Secretary Thomas. War Secretary Halifax replaces Londonderry as Lord Privy Seal. The only new member of the cabinet is Cooper, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, who is now appointed as War Secretary. The British monarch has approved Cooper to be sworn in as a member of the Privy Council. The exchange of positions between MacDonald and Thomas has greatly surprised the government. It is likely due to the fact that Thomas could not deeply satisfy the expectations of the Dominions. The Dominion Office has always been regarded as a prominent position. This move is probably intended to find a seat for MacDonald in Parliament. MacDonald is expected to be a candidate for the by-election of a member of the Scottish Universities. It is said that Prime Minister Baldwin is now seeking to improve relations with the Irish Free State, and because Thomas's attitude is tough, it is difficult to reach a compromise with the head of the Free State government, Valera, as long as he is in office. MacDonald is more likely to achieve this compromise, so he was exchanged with Thomas. The list of the cabinet after the reshuffle is as follows:</p>
<p>Prime Minister: Baldwin</p>
<p>Lord President of the Council: MacDonald</p>
<p>Home Secretary: Simon</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary: Hoare</p>

<h3>Abyssinian Troops Consolidate Defense Lines</h3>
<p>Sufficient Military Supplies for Seven Months</p>
<p>(London) Due to difficulties with inspection and transportation, news from various battlefronts in Abyssinia is rather chaotic. According to a report from Reuters special correspondent Collins from Dire Dawa on the northern front, the Abyssinian Emperor recently inspected the southern front in person. He expressed optimism about the situation there. The Emperor agreed with Generals Nasibu at Jijiga to mount a fierce defense at Dagah Bur, 110 miles southeast of Harar. However, the main Abyssinian defenses should be concentrated between Jijiga and Harar, paying particular attention to the left flank. It is expected that the main Italian attack will be launched along the border of British Somaliland from a point on the main road from Dagah Bur to Hargeisa to Jijiga. Currently, there are ample military supplies stored west of Jijiga, enough to supply the army for at least seven months. The Emperor expressed his deep appreciation for this. Furthermore, Reuters special correspondent Holm, who is visiting the Italian army on the northern front, reported from Asmara, detailing the Italian preparations, which are a race between the new commander-in-chief of the Italian army, General Badoglio, and the sanctions. This can be seen from official announcements. It is said that there are now 500 trucks carrying hundreds of tons of ammunition, which are being collected at ammunition depots near the front lines. An active ordnance repair shop, which has repaired various weapons 3,000 times to date, has now moved closer to the front lines. Although Italian aircraft make reconnaissance flights from time to time, they have not been able to discover the location of the Abyssinian troops under Magal Nann, indicating that the Abyssinian troops are now also well-versed in the tactics of concealment and dispersal. In addition, Reuters correspondent Ship Hank in the Abyssinian capital reported that recent rumors unfavorable to Abyssinia have caused public morale to decline. Today, the public was greatly excited by the very good news from the official field. The Emperor is very satisfied with the deployment of troops on the southern front and believes that there is no need to continue sending reinforcements south. Also, Reuters correspondent Harrison in Djibouti telegraphed London today, saying that an important person related to Abyssinia recently arrived in Djibouti. He visited him and was told that the Italian army only needs to wait, and the Abyssinian army will collapse on its own. The Abyssinian army has already felt the shortage of food. A few days ago, a special envoy arrived at the residence of General Seyoum, requesting that food be transported quickly to supply the soldiers on the front lines. They lack military logistics agencies and are now suffering from hunger (Reuter's dispatch on the 23rd).</p>
<p>Asmara. Italian troops searched the mountains of Tai Ping today, hoping for a decisive battle with General Sai Xiong's 30,000 troops. The two armies have only had minor contact so far. One Italian troop captain, two Askaris, and nine Abyssinian soldiers died. The Italian Command here today denied that General Sai Xiong's troops had dispersed. An Italian military spokesman declared that the Italian army was very eager for a major battle and wished to resolve the war as soon as possible. However, the Abyssinian army avoids a decisive battle and relies on guerrilla tactics, so the war may be prolonged. But this is also beneficial to the Italian army, because the Italian army's preparations are adequate. It was learned today that Italian aircraft failed to detect the location of General Sai Xiong's troops in the Tai Ping area. It is said that General Sai Xiong has already led his troops south to avoid being surrounded by the Italian army. (National News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Asmara. The troops commanded by Abyssinian General Ayllu today attempted to cross the Tekeze River and attack the Italian front lines. They were repelled by the mixed troops of the Second Army. Machine guns on the north bank of the river rained down bullets. It is now believed that the enemy soldiers suffered many casualties. It is reported that the Italian troops occupying the Tekeze area are now placing General Ayllu's troops in a dangerous situation, because they are now unable to provide the soldiers and livestock with muddy water. (Reuter's dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Said. The new commander-in-chief of the Italian army in East Africa, Badoglio, arrived here today, accompanied by five Italian generals. Many people waited to welcome him. (National News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>

<p>(New York) According to the latest report from the U.S. Treasury Department, the U.S. gold reserves are worth a total of £1,960,000,000, and more continues to arrive. Since September, the inflow of foreign gold has been £125,000,000, of which £72,000,000 came from France, £30,000,000 from the United Kingdom, and £12,000,000 from the Netherlands. There is some concern about this continuous inflow of gold, because the gold that has not been used is now filling the banks. If a large amount continues to flow in, it may help promote the burgeoning of latent lending and inflation. (Reuter's dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>New Atmosphere Between France and Germany</h3>
<p>A Solution to the Russian Question is Expected</p>
<p>(Berlin) It was recently announced by official figures that after the recent talks between Chief Hitler and French envoy Poncet, a new atmosphere has emerged between France and Germany. All outstanding legal cases between the two sides, especially the issue of Franco-Russian mutual assistance, are expected to be resolved promptly. Since the end of the plebiscite in the Saar region in January of this year, there have been no territorial disputes between France and Germany. In addition, there are only various legal issues. Regarding the Franco-Russian mutual assistance treaty, Germany raised reservations after signing the treaty, saying that it conflicted with the provisions of the Locarno Treaty. Afterwards, although the French government provided explanations, the German government still did not find them satisfactory. Now that there is more understanding between France and Germany, this matter is also expected to be resolved satisfactorily. German political figures also believe that there are no practical difficulties preventing the establishment of a satisfactory agreement between France and Germany. (Havas dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Smuggling Ring Cracked in Kobe and Yokohama</h3>

<h3>Japanese Army and Navy Arrive at Yuguan and Tanggu</h3>
<p>—Three Airplanes Also Arrive in Tianjin—</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: Since the Japanese army started moving west from outside the pass, as of the 20th, the Matsui Brigade of the Kwantung Army stationed in the Jinzhou-Suizhong area has successively arrived in Shanhaiguan. Except for a portion of the Koga Regiment staying behind for defense, two-thirds of the entire brigade were transported to Yuguan starting November 13th, stationed in the barracks south of the railway and inside the South Gate, occupying civilian houses. As a result, merchant residents are living three or four families to a room. All supplies are handled by the Shanhaiguan Public Security Bureau and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce.

<h3>Yellow River Mouth Not Blocked, Disaster in Dongping Becomes More Severe</h3>
<p>Various Flood Relief Associations Appeal to All Parties for Assistance</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: This summer, the Yellow River breached its banks, affecting Dongping. Tens of thousands of acres of fertile land were turned into a vast sea, and hundreds of villages were submerged. Now that winter has arrived, the water has receded and the land has dried up in other flooded counties, and the disaster situation has been alleviated. However, in Dongping County, because the Yellow River breach at Dongzhuang has not been blocked, the Yellow River water continues to flow in, and the Yellow River water and accumulated water have almost merged into rivers, making the flood disaster even more severe. In recent days, strong winds have repeatedly risen, and the waves have been turbulent. All embankments and villages have been destroyed by the raging waves. Therefore, the various flood relief associations in the county have made a special appeal to all parties, requesting assistance. The telegram reads as follows: "Dongping is unfortunate and has suffered a terrible disaster. This summer, the Yellow River breached its banks, and a large amount of water poured in. Tens of thousands of acres of fertile land in Dongping have turned into a vast sea, and hundreds of villages have been submerged. The great disaster and calamity are truly difficult to describe. Now that winter has arrived, the water has receded and the land has dried up in other counties, and the disaster situation has been alleviated. However, Dongping is different because the breach at Dongzhuang has not been blocked, the Yellow River water continues to flow in, merging into a vast sea. The water is getting deeper, the disaster is getting more severe, and our people are suffering even more. Recently, strong winds have risen from time to time, and the waves are滔天，时有堤岸村舍，尽为惊涛骇浪所摧毁，民陷水中，巨浪交迫，生命危急，伏祈迅发赈款，救此苍生，民命垂危，谨电呼吁，不胜迫切待命之至，东平县各界水灾救济会叩、"(21st)</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Province: Repairing Breached Embankments</h3>
<p>—Relief Association Asks the Provincial Government to Provide Relief Through Work—</p>
<p>Raofu Dispatch: The Provincial Relief Association, in order to provide relief to the millions of disaster victims in the Gan River, Xiu River, Rui River areas that were inundated by the summer floods, has repeatedly telegraphed the central government for assistance. With winter approaching and disaster victims in various places without clothing or food, in addition to raising funds for winter clothing to be distributed to the disaster areas, there are also plans to gather disaster victims to repair the breached embankments in various counties, providing relief through work. The counties most severely affected include Poyang, with 81 breached embankments, Yongxiu with 38, Nanchang with more than 40, Xinjian with 161, Yugan with 43, and Wannian with 2. Local governments lack the resources to repair them, and urgent work relief is needed. It is now proposed to use the relief funds allocated by the central government to repair the aforementioned breached embankments, recruiting disaster victims from various places for work. Breached embankments in other less affected counties will be repaired after raising additional funds. At the same time, planning is underway for drilling wells, digging ponds, setting up sluices, dredging ditches, and preparing vehicles to prevent both drought and flood disasters. The funds have been telegraphed to the central government by the provincial government and the relief association, requesting the allocation of relief funds for assistance. Currently, in addition to the 50,000 yuan allocated by the Shanghai Flood Relief Association, the Central Relief Committee has successively allocated 84,500 yuan, totaling 134,500 yuan. Among them, the 50,000 yuan from the Relief Association has already been used by the association for relief efforts. The 84,500 yuan remitted to the provincial government by the central government is currently being presented to the provincial government by the relief association, requesting that it be fully allocated to the association for work relief.

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Finance Minister Kong Pays Attention to Rural Social Livelihood Plans to Establish County and Township Banks, Complete China's Local Banking System, Develop Production Industries to Seek Self-Reliance, Connect the Financial Strength of Cities and Towns with Rural Areas</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng She reported: Since the announcement of the implementation of the legal tender, there have been inquiries and questions from the public in the north and south about how to use the legal tender in rural society. According to reliable sources, Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi is very concerned about the livelihood of rural society, not only engaging in passive relief but also having active construction plans, with a deep understanding and evaluation of the remote and recent causes of economic depression, roughly as follows: Since China opened up to trade, we have been exporting raw materials in large quantities at low prices, while importing products in small quantities at high prices. The extent of the loss from this import and export trade cannot be statistically calculated. In recent years, due to the drastic fluctuations in silver prices, the export of local raw materials has been greatly hindered, while cheap foreign goods have been dumped in large quantities, exceeding the annual increase, creating an unprecedentedly serious phenomenon in China. What is particularly serious is that the outflow of silver is frequently reported. Not only is the outflow of silver bars and ingots an inexhaustible trend, but it has also been discovered that the silver coins already minted in China are being smuggled, melted, and profited from. In order to adopt the principles of modern countries to preserve coins in the treasury and circulate banknotes in the market, and to maintain China's economic strength, the announcement of the implementation of the legal tender to recover coins was made, fortunately with the consensus of friendly countries. Therefore, designs are divided into two aspects, external and internal.</p>
<p>(1) External Aspects: International trade is the responsibility of the Central, China, and Communications Banks to handle international remittance receipts and payments. Although import trade currently exceeds export trade, the exchange rate must be accurately calculated, properly paid, and thoroughly statistically analyzed. For trade deficits, the exchange rate is naturally in a reverse state; for trade surpluses, the exchange rate is naturally in a forward state. Modern developing countries all look forward to the development of their production industries, and all look forward to gradually transitioning from import trade to export trade, and from reverse exchange rates to forward exchange rates. The use of these fluctuations and changes is entirely controlled and converted by the country itself as the only way to succeed, otherwise, there is no hope of success. The current implementation of the legal tender is the appropriate method for China to balance trade.</p>
<p>(2) Internal Aspects: In modern countries, political power is used to promote economic development, and the implementation of financial policies is the starting point. The foundation of financial policies is whether the banking system has been completed. Currently, China has completed the central banking system, but the local banking system is still deficient. The planned establishment of the China County and Township Bank is to complete China's local banking system. The main points are as follows: (1) The China County and Township Bank is the general driving force for developing national production industries and the general hub for connecting the financial strength of cities and towns with rural areas. (2) The local situation of each county varies, and the needs are also different. If a certain county is suitable for agriculture, then assisting agriculture is naturally the main purpose; if it is suitable for industry, commerce, and other special industries, then assisting other industries is naturally the main purpose. The name "China County and Township Bank" is for the sake of easy transformation of investment and is its characteristic. (3) The capital of the head office of the China County and Township Bank is allocated by the central government. The capital of the branch offices is based on the counties under the old Daoshu, with each county forming a branch office unit, which is raised by the county governments and the people. Regarding the inspection of the situation in various counties and townships, branch offices may be established without additional capital. The head office manages the branch offices, and the branch offices manage the offices. If the production industry of County A is needed for the daily life of the people, but there is a temporary financial difficulty, and County B cannot help, or if the production industry of County C has a temporary financial difficulty, and County D cannot provide financial support, then the head office should maintain it at this time. If the head office is unable, it shall report to the central government for approval to lend money from the central banks to the head office of the county and township bank for indirect maintenance. Thus, the national production industries will not only not collapse but will also develop properly and advance at an accelerated pace, placing the country in a strong position with a sure victory. In short, the China County and Township Bank is organized by the government and the people, creating cooperation and implementation of the political forces of the central government and local governments, which can exert a great effect in promoting the development of the national economy. Therefore, the establishment of the China County and Township Bank is an economic policy to develop national production industries and seek self-reliance. It is reported that Mr. Kong sincerely expects to see it implemented as soon as possible, which is fortunate for the country and fortunate for the local areas.</p>

Now, in order to facilitate operations, the Association has specially established a Secretariat and hired Jin Guobao as the secretary. The office has been arranged and will begin operations next week. It will be further divided into various sections and personnel will be assigned to specialize in their duties. The Association will also hire leaders from the Chinese and foreign financial circles as consultants.</p>
<p>Announcement of Articles and Regulations: The various articles and regulations of the Association have been drafted by the drafting committee appointed by Xu Kan and others at the first committee meeting and have been reviewed many times by the Standing Committee. It is reported that after the Chairman of the Association, Finance Minister Kong, comes to Shanghai and convenes the second plenary meeting of all members, they will be submitted for discussion and approval, and then submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval and implementation.</p>
<p>Dispatch of Supervisors: The reorganization of the Central Bank into a Reserve Bank is a step after the implementation of the new monetary policy. It is currently under review by the Executive Yuan and is expected to be realized in early next month. It is reported that in order to promote the business of domestic banks, the bank will dispatch supervisors to assist in the handling of business, in order to improve the general financial efficiency. The personnel will be selected from the staff of the bank's Economic Research Department. It is said that the bank has submitted this proposal to the Ministry of Finance for referral to the Executive Yuan for record.</p>
<h3>National Goods Bank Undertakes Exchange of Miscellaneous Silver for Legal Tender</h3>
<p>Collecting miscellaneous silver from North China and the Yangtze River region; all branches have been notified to comply</p>
<p>The Industrial Society states that the China National Goods Bank in this city has been approved by the Ministry of Finance to start collecting miscellaneous silver materials from today. North China and the Yangtze River region will also be handled simultaneously. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Approved by the Ministry of Finance After the Ministry of Finance implemented the new currency policy on the 4th of this month, all silver cash should be nationalized. The miscellaneous silver materials and silver dollars held by the people have been exchanged for legal tender one after another. Although the Central Bank of this city and its branches in various places have set up miscellaneous silver collection offices, and the China and Jiaotong Banks specialize in collecting silver dollars, other ports have not yet universally handled this. In view of this, the bank has submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance through the board of directors to undertake the collection of miscellaneous silver materials in North China and the Yangtze River area, in order to facilitate the exchange of miscellaneous silver by the people for legal tender. Now that the bank has received the order, it has notified its branches in various places to comply. Regarding the calculation of fineness and discount, detailed rules will be formulated separately.</p>
<p>The Bank's Announcement The bank issued a public notice yesterday stating that it has been approved by the Ministry of Finance to undertake the collection of miscellaneous silver materials in North China and the Yangtze River area.

<p>The Shanghai Money Trade Association, in response to the request from the Cigarette and Exchange Industry to investigate and reply regarding the "Guangjiao" grey market issue, held its eighth regular meeting of the third session at 2:00 PM yesterday at the Ningbo Road Clubhouse. The attending committee members included He Zhongxiao, Shao Yanshan, Xi Jiming, Liu Wuqiao, Lu Shuchen, and five others.

(1) A resolution was made to appoint Zhang Mengzhou as a representative to supervise the lottery of the long-term and short-term public bonds for the electrical industry in the 19th year of the Construction Committee. (2) Regarding the Cigarette and Exchange Industry's request to investigate and reply regarding the "Guangjiao" grey market issue, it was resolved that the members of the association are all exchange houses, and do not engage in the buying and selling of subsidiary currency on the grey market, so there is no way to investigate and reply.

<h3>President Wang Examined at His Residence Yesterday</h3>
<p>X-rays were still used for thoroughness; whether to operate depends on tomorrow morning's decision</p>
<p>President Wang stayed in Shanghai yesterday for recuperation and did not go out. Regarding the bullet left in his back, in addition to personally going to Hong En Hospital the day before yesterday to have an X-ray taken to determine the location of the bullet, which was on the right side of the fifth section of the spine, at 9:00 AM yesterday, he specially invited Niu Huilin and Niu Huisheng, along with Dr. Chen Jiayu from the Orthopedic Hospital, to bring the X-ray equipment from the Orthopedic Hospital to his private residence on Anhe Temple Road for repeated X-ray examination to ensure thoroughness. Doctors Niu and others did not leave until about 12:00 noon, and returned to the hospital to develop the X-ray photos. At 5:00 PM, Dr. Chen Jiayu sent the photos to Wang's residence. According to a news release from the Orthopedic Hospital last night, the X-ray taken yesterday morning used the planar irradiation method, which was the same as the one used by the Central Hospital before, and the results were also the same, proving that the bullet was still in the original position and had not moved. The bullet is very small and made of steel, unlike lead, which is toxic, so the Niu brothers firmly believed that it was not necessary to remove it. However, President Wang himself and his relatives were worried and wanted to remove it, but since there would inevitably be a reaction after the operation, it would depend on his physical condition. Dr. Niu went elsewhere yesterday afternoon and is scheduled to return to Shanghai tonight. Tomorrow morning, he will go to Wang's residence for further examination. Whether or not surgery is necessary will be the final decision tomorrow morning.</p>

<h3>The Silverware Industry Association Held a General Meeting Yesterday; Decided to Request Special Permission to Use Silver Fineness</h3>
<p>Submitting a request to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to be forwarded to the Ministry of Finance for instructions; Sending separate letters to colleagues in other ports for a unified approach</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silverware Industry Association, due to the promulgation of the "Regulations on the Management of Silver Products" by the Ministry of Finance, which has created obstacles in both work and business and affects the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of employees, convened a general meeting of all member representatives yesterday. More than twenty representatives, including Yan Zhiyun and Lin Xiao, attended. Chairman Zhong Chuansheng chaired the meeting as scheduled. The chairman first reported the purpose of the meeting, as well as letters and telegrams received from colleagues in the Yangtze River basin and a letter from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, along with the "Regulations on the Management of Silver Used in Silver Products" issued by the Ministry of Finance, etc.</p>
<p>Research Results After the chairman's report, the meeting began to discuss and deeply study each of the regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Finance. The results of the research are recorded below: Article 2 only allows the use of 30% silver. The industry uses manual manufacturing, and such hard materials cannot be made into utensils, and will be easily broken if struck. The color is also not white. It is decided to submit a request to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to be forwarded to the Ministry of Finance, requesting permission to follow the "but presented" clause in Article 11, allowing the association to approve and record the case. Article 3 stipulates that the association has never sold silver ingots as raw materials. Article 4 states that the members of the association respectfully comply with the regulations issued by the Ministry and report the utensils and jewelry. There are hundreds of types, which are difficult to distinguish and categorize. It is decided to report the total weight of utensils and jewelry as one type, and the total weight of silver ingots and old ornaments as another type, for easy review. Article 5 states that the raw materials are purchased from the China, Jiaotong and Central Banks. The industry members feel fortunate, and the silver shops that are members of the association are willing to form a joint guarantee and be jointly responsible. Article 6: Since there is a request in Article 11 with the "but presented" clause, and there is a report in Article 7, there is no further discussion. Article 7: Comply with the order. Article 8: If a member silver shop suspends business, the remaining silver ornaments will be purchased by other members of the association and reported to the association and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to be forwarded to the Central Bank for record, in order to avoid the abandonment of decorations and labor costs. Article 9: According to Article 5, the members will be jointly responsible, and the association will send personnel to supervise at any time, so there is no problem. Article 10: Comply with the principle, but request that the inspection agencies order the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the association to send personnel to handle the matter together, to avoid miscommunication. All the above articles were passed one by one, and it was unanimously decided to proceed. Separate letters were sent to colleagues in major ports in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hubei, etc. for reference. The meeting was then adjourned.</p>
<p>Document to the Chamber of Commerce After the meeting, a document was drafted immediately, reporting all the difficulties and requesting the Chamber of Commerce to forward it to the Ministry of Finance. The original document stated: "Submitted for the regulations on the management of silver used in silver products issued by the Ministry, which has created obstacles in both work and business for the silverware industry. We urge you to forward it to the Ministry of Finance, requesting a decree to approve the case and allow us to continue manufacturing with the old silver content, in order to maintain business and benefit industry and commerce. We respectfully received a letter from your esteemed association stating that on the 18th of this month, we received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance deleting the full text of the twelve articles of the 'Regulations on the Management of Silver Used in Silver Products,' which was issued to the association with instructions to comply and forward it to the affiliates for compliance, etc. Now, we enclose a copy of the regulations and respectfully submit it to you. We hope that your esteemed association will print multiple copies and forward them to the industry members for reference, and complete the provisions of Article 4 of the regulations within one month, as required, etc. We also attach a full copy of the 'Regulations on the Management of Silver Used in Silver Products.' Upon receiving this, we respectfully investigated that the affiliated industry members were deeply concerned when they saw the articles of the management regulations published in the newspapers in this city. Considering that it concerns their own interests, they requested the affiliated association to convene a temporary meeting on the 17th of this month. Everyone believed that the Ministry of Finance issued the silver management regulations in order to comprehensively calculate and eliminate leakage. Although the industry members of the affiliated association belong to merchants, their patriotism is no less than others. If they can try their best to comply, how dare they say more? However, the member stores are named 'silverware shops,' and naturally making silver utensils and ornaments is their basic business. At this time, when the trend of women cutting their hair is prevalent, ornaments have already been hit hard. What they usually rely on to operate is only a small number of silver utensils. If the silver content is restricted, and even the utensils cannot be made, then the industry members across the country will be reduced to nothing. According to national legislation, deep attention is paid to commercial habits and good customs. Even the criminal law has provisions that acts based on business are not considered crimes, which shows the importance of business habits. The affiliated industry members have a long history of hundreds of years. Our financial authorities love and care for industry and commerce in every detail. They cannot bear to sit idly by and watch the livelihood of all the industry members and employees be cut off. Moreover, the silver ingots and materials usually used by the affiliated industry members are only used to make utensils or ornaments, and they do not sell raw materials. The price of the finished utensils and ornaments is calculated based on the market price of silver per tael, and the cost of manual labor and decoration is added. The average cost per tael is about 3-4 national currency dollars. If they were to traffic, not only would there be no profit, but they would also suffer a great loss, which even the most foolish person would not want to do. Therefore, in fact, there is no worry about trafficking and leakage. The affiliated industry members have a habit of collecting silver utensils and ornaments that they have sold in the past. The collected old silver utensils, etc., are still refined and purified by each household and used as raw materials for making utensils. This cycle continues, and the buyer encounters an urgent need to pawn, exchange, or convert. Even if there are unscrupulous people who try to traffic and make profits, it is impossible. If the silver content exceeds 30% as stipulated in Article 2 of the Ministry's regulations, the material will be hard and easily broken during work. Even if it is successfully made into a utensil, the color will not be easy to whiten. Moreover, for utensils with fine workmanship, such as figures, flowers, etc., it is impossible to manufacture them due to the hardness of the material. The affiliated industry members have always followed the approved industry regulations in manufacturing silver utensils, containing 88% pure silver. Therefore, they are trusted by buyers. If the original silver content is reduced to 30%, the silver content will be low and the material will be hard, making it difficult for buyers to be satisfied and for the utensils to be manufactured with fine workmanship. Therefore, it will be impossible to operate the business. The impact on the livelihood of our silverware industry members and hundreds of thousands of employees will be on the verge of extinction. The affiliated industry members unanimously call for help and request your esteemed association to forward the facts and difficulties listed above to the Ministry of Finance, requesting a decree to approve the case in accordance with the provisions of the 'but presented' clause in Article 11 of the management regulations, and allow us to continue manufacturing with the old silver content, in order to maintain business and benefit industry and commerce. In addition, the reporting procedures in Article 4 of the original regulations should request that the existing silver utensils and ornaments be classified as one type, and the raw silver as another type, because the affiliated industry members produce a variety of colors and names, which are difficult to classify and list in detail. When reviewing, we also ask the Ministry of Finance to order your esteemed association to send personnel to handle the matter together with the affiliated association, so as to avoid any misunderstandings and to ensure the accuracy of the verification. We hereby submit this respectfully to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai Silverware Industry Association."</p>
<p>Letter to Colleagues The association also sent separate letters to colleagues in other ports, stating: "Dear colleagues, our association received a letter from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce on the 19th of this month, stating that we received an order from the Ministry of Finance to comply with the twelve articles of the 'Regulations on the Management of Silver Used in Silver Products,' which were issued to the association with instructions to forward them to the affiliates for compliance, etc., and to complete the provisions of Article 4 of the regulations within one month, as required. Our association has already submitted a request to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to forward it to the Ministry of Finance, requesting the approval for the record under Article 11. We are consulting with lawyers who said that it is better to submit a joint request, rather than each industry member submitting to the local Chamber of Commerce to forward to the Ministry of Finance. It is faster to request approval for the 'but presented' clause in Article 11 than to request the amendment of the regulations. We enclose a printed copy of the document submitted by our association. We urge you to immediately convene your colleagues and submit a request to the local Chamber of Commerce using the same steps, in order to increase our strength, the sooner the better. If you have already proceeded, please send the written details to our association. We look forward to hearing from you."</p>

<h3>Changtai Steamer Ran Aground in Hankou Yesterday</h3>
<p>Barges Have Been Sent to Unload Cargo</p>
<p>The Changtai Steamer, owned by Antai Steamer Company located at No. 9 Xingye Lane, French Concession, and represented by Tuominxin Company, departed from Chenjiagang today, fully loaded with salt, and sailed to Yuezhou Chenglinji for delivery. At 8:00 AM on the 19th, it passed through the Wusong Estuary. Yesterday, the ship arrived near Hankou, about twenty-eight miles away from its destination. However, due to the pilot's misdirection, the ship was driven onto a shoal and ran aground.</p>
<p>Circumstances of the Grounding The shipowner, named Zhu Ya'fu, hired two river pilots to navigate the ship. At 3:00 AM yesterday, the ship arrived near the Huquang pontoon and suddenly veered off course, and the ship ran aground on the river surface at that location. Due to the ship being fully loaded with salt and drawing a deep draft, the shipowner tried to free the ship by its own means, but failed to move it even by reversing the engine.</p>
<p>Telegram Requesting Barges The shipowner, unable to do anything, sent an urgent telegram to the representative office in Shanghai, Tuominxin Steamer Company, stating that the Changtai Steamer ran aground at the Huquang pontoon at 3:00 AM on the 23rd of this month, and cannot be freed for the time being. The ship is fully loaded with salt. Please find a way to send barges to unload the salt in the ship first, so as to reduce the load, and then seek to tow it out. Tuominxin Company has forwarded this telegram to the China Ship Insurance Association. Tuominxin Steamer Company has already sent a telegram to hire and send barges to transfer the salt from the cargo hold. Since the salt cannot be delayed on the ship for a long time, the loss would be greater.</p>
<p>Brief History of the Changtai Steamer The steamer is made of steel, with a length of 278 feet 2 inches, a width of 34 feet 6 inches, a depth of 21 feet 3 inches, and a draft of 16 feet 6 inches. It has two decks and a speed of 10 nautical miles per hour. It was built in England in 1891 and has hull and machinery insurance in the China Ship Insurance Association.</p>
<h3>This Newspaper Received Flood Relief Donations Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Consuls from Various Countries in Shanghai Form a Tourist Group to Hangzhou</h3>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reported that consuls from various countries stationed in Shanghai, including the French Consul General Baudachin and more than fifty others, formed a tourist group and left Shanghai by special train at 3:15 PM yesterday to visit Hangzhou in early winter.</p>
<h3>Li Jingcong Discusses the Recent State of Civil Aviation in Our Country</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency: A reporter noted that it has been four or five years since the establishment of civil aviation in our country. He wondered whether the general public's utilization and the operators' performance could match that of European and American countries. Those concerned about aviation were eager to know. Therefore, he specially visited Mr. Li Jingcong, the general manager of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation, to inquire about it. Mr. Li provided a detailed response as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Regarding the General Public's Utilization</p>
<p>In recent years, there have been three aviation organizations in our country available for public use: Eurasia Aviation Corporation, China National Aviation Corporation, and Southwest Aviation Corporation. The total length of the routes of these three companies is approximately 30,000 li. The total number of stations is about forty. The statistics for postal delivery, passenger transport, and cargo transport for China National Aviation Corporation and Southwest Aviation Corporation are not readily available to me, so I must refrain from providing them. I will only briefly describe the general public's use of Eurasia Aviation Corporation. The total length of Eurasia Aviation Corporation's routes is approximately 15,000 li, with a total of seventeen stations. Currently, the Lanzhou to Tacheng section, which is 4,450 li long and has four stations, is temporarily suspended due to political influences in Xinjiang. The remaining routes, such as the Shanghai-Nanjing-Zhengzhou-Xi'an-Lanzhou route, which is over 3,700 li long, only require a departure from Shanghai at 6:30 AM to arrive in Lanzhou by 4:30 PM. The Shanghai-Nanjing-Zhengzhou-Xi'an-Hanzhong-Chengdu route, which is over 3,800 li long, also only requires a departure from Shanghai at 6:00 AM to arrive in Chengdu by 5:00 PM. Other destinations, such as Shanghai to Ningxia and Baotou, can also be reached overnight. Compared to the journeys from Shanghai to Lanzhou and Shanghai to Chengdu, which would take at least ten days using other means of transportation such as trains, ships, and cars, the difference is like heaven and earth. The statistics on passenger, cargo, and postal usage of aviation show an increasing trend month by month. In the first and second years, Eurasia Aviation Corporation carried 941 passengers, 577 kilograms of mail, and 4,151 kilograms of cargo. In the third year, it carried 652 passengers, 2,857 kilograms of mail, and 16,391 kilograms of cargo. In the fourth year, it carried 1,074 passengers, 4,169 kilograms of mail, and 43,092 kilograms of cargo. In the fifth year, it carried 2,110 passengers, 8,796 kilograms of mail, and 58,881 kilograms of cargo. In the recent four months of this year, it has carried 015 passengers, 2,845 kilograms of mail, and 28,878 kilograms of cargo, already surpassing the achievements of the entire first, second, and third years, as well as half of the fourth and fifth years. From this, we can see the enthusiasm of the general public for using aviation. When the general public has urgent business correspondence or urgently needs to communicate with relatives, using aviation is not slower than using telegrams, but is more detailed and cheaper. Furthermore, the post office staff's handling of airmail is particularly fast compared to ordinary express mail. Therefore, the recent surge in airmail volume is on a steady upward trend. The same is true for cargo and parcels. As for passengers, in recent months, in addition to increasing the number of scheduled flights to meet demand, extra flights have often had to be added. This is a general overview of the public's use of aviation.</p>
<p>(B) Regarding the Operators' Performance</p>
<p>I would also like to briefly describe the scope of Eurasia Aviation Corporation as follows:</p>
<p>1. Aircraft Equipment: Eurasia Aviation Corporation initially used Junkers all-metal low-wing single-engine aircraft. According to statistics, these aircraft are very unlikely to injure passengers even in the event of an accident. Recently, Eurasia Aviation Corporation has further adopted Junkers all-metal low-wing three-engine aircraft for increased safety. Each of these three engines has 650 horsepower, so even if one fails, it will not affect the flight and can safely continue to its destination. As for the interior of the cabin, each passenger's seat is not only extremely comfortable and not crowded, but there is also a smoking room and a washroom. In addition to viewing the scenery through the windows during the flight, exquisite refreshments are provided. Furthermore, the wireless telegraph transceiver in the cockpit can be used by passengers to telegraph friends and relatives to meet them at intermediate stops or to welcome them at the destination.</p>
<p>2. Blind Flying Equipment: Blind flying instruments are essential equipment for scheduled flights. Since not every day of the year can be guaranteed to be clear and sunny, it is necessary to prepare for resistance to bad weather in order to avoid affecting the schedule. The tool for resistance depends on blind flying instruments. Blind flying instruments are used for flying in the clouds without any targets. Flying in the clouds has become an unavoidable fact in almost every flight of Eurasia Aviation Corporation. The Liupan Mountains between Xi'an and Lanzhou and the Qinling Mountains between Xi'an and Chengdu are almost always covered by clouds. Without this blind flying equipment, in such situations, one would have to fly around the valleys or simply dare not proceed. Eurasia Aviation Corporation is equipped with this type of instrument, so in such situations, the aircraft only needs to ascend upwards, directly into the clouds, until it flies out of the high altitude of the mountain peaks, and then it can safely fly towards the destination over the high mountains covered by clouds without any worries.</p>
<p>3. Direction Finder Equipment: Having blind flying equipment without a direction finder to determine the direction of flight would not be helpful for scheduled flights. Although aircraft can rely on blind flying instruments to calmly maneuver when flying into the clouds, the accurate direction must be based on the direction finder. Radio communication methods are used to inform the pilots of the direction of flight and assist them in flying to the destination station. Eurasia Aviation Corporation's aircraft are equipped with this type of direction finder, so even if the destination station is obscured by low clouds, it will not hinder its arrival.</p>
<p>4. Wireless Equipment: Eurasia Aviation Corporation has installed long-wave wireless transceivers in all aircraft and along the route stations to prevent accidents and sudden drastic changes in weather, so that stations and aircraft can have the opportunity to notify each other for rescue or avoidance, thereby ensuring safety. At the same time, to prevent business communications between stations or the head office from being affected by safety communications between stations and aircraft, short-wave radio stations have been installed at each station so that long-wave radio is exclusively for communication with aircraft, while short-wave radio is for communication between stations or the head office.</p>
<p>5. Station Facilities: Because the routes operated by Eurasia Aviation Corporation are mostly in remote areas of the Northwest, accommodation, food, and drink are extremely inconvenient and very poor. In order to make aviation passengers feel more comfortable, in addition to building station houses along the route for reception and rest, spacious houses and clean food and drink are specially prepared in Xi'an, Lanzhou, Suzhou, and other places for passengers to eat and stay, which is much better than finding a local hotel.</p>
<p>6. Night Flights Between Beijing and Shanghai: In order to arouse the public's greater interest in aviation, Eurasia Aviation Corporation has installed searchlights and other necessary equipment for night flights on aircraft and at airports. It also uses its existing complete equipment for blind flying, direction finders, and radio to organize night flights between Beijing and Shanghai, allowing a group of aviation passengers to overlook the beautiful scenery of thousands of lights in the twilight sky without any danger. Since the opening of the service about two months ago, almost every flight has been fully booked. This has not only broken the new record for Eurasia Aviation Corporation's passenger carrying, but it is also the first of its kind in Asia's aviation industry.</p>
<p>7. Training of National Technical Personnel: In addition to operating aviation, Eurasia Aviation Corporation is also working hard to train national technical personnel. The personnel recruited and trained are all graduates of mechanical schools, high schools, or aviation schools at home and abroad. At present, more than 40 people have been successfully trained and dispersed to work in repair shops along the route stations and in Nanyuan, Beiping, and Longhua in the local area. Twelve people have also been sent to Germany for further study. Recently, letters have been sent to various industrial universities to request them to introduce graduates with excellent character and learning to continue training. There are already four people who are purely national flight personnel who are flying on the aircraft, and there are also six people who are working as onboard mechanics and telecommunications personnel. These national flight personnel and onboard mechanics and telecommunications personnel have all been trained in blind flying and are technically no less competent than their German counterparts. Given time, their achievements will be even more impressive.</p>
<p>Flight Safety and Punctuality: The above seven points are only a brief overview of the major achievements of Eurasia Aviation Corporation. Other companies, such as China National Aviation Corporation and Southwest Aviation Corporation, must also have made considerable contributions. Eurasia Aviation Corporation is particularly cautious about all the above points, so since its opening in 1931, there has never been a case of an accident endangering passengers due to aircraft negligence, nor has there ever been a case of suspension of flights due to obstacles from storms, low clouds, or light fog. Its flight safety and punctuality are not only excellent in Asia, but also in no way inferior to countries with developed aviation in Europe and America.</p>
<p>Our Hopes: Our country has a vast territory with rugged mountains. Ships cannot reach everywhere, and the construction of railways and roads is costly and time-consuming. Aviation facilities are easier and require less money. If the general public's understanding of air transportation can keep pace with the times and be fully utilized, and if aviation operators can also work hard to catch up, then the development of the aviation industry may surpass Europe and America and become a very common phenomenon in life. In our country, if we want comfortable and rapid transportation, there is no alternative to aviation. I still remember when trains were first invented, the general public was very wary of riding them. But today, wherever there are trains, no one is willing to ride mule carts or sedan chairs. So, looking at the current situation, will airplanes in China not become as common as trains, cars, and ships in a few years? The only difference is that one takes months or days to travel, while the other takes only a few hours or minutes.</p>

<h3>Detectives of the French Concession Police</h3>
<p>Cracked a Den of Rickshaw Thieves</p>
<p>The Gang of "Yellow Oxen" Completely Exposed</p>
<p>The leader and his accomplices were arrested in the Haig Road area. Twelve plaintiffs appeared in court to testify against the four Jiangbei thieves.</p>
<p>In the past, there was a group of rickshaw pullers in this city who formed gangs to steal rickshaws on the streets or collude with accomplices to steal them. These people called it "pulling yellow oxen" in their jargon. After stealing the rickshaws, they hid them in predetermined locations and waited for the owners to find them and pay a ransom to get them back. This was essentially a disguised form of kidnapping and was an organized form of theft. There was a leader above and many accomplices below. This trend was rampant several years ago. After the police authorities strictly investigated and cracked down on it, this trend subsided slightly. Recently, it has revived again. Recently, Zhou Ruzhang, a detective of the French Concession Police, along with detectives Peng Zhengyou and Xikai (transliteration), cracked this type of theft ring and arrested four members of the gang from Jiangbei: Zhi Anli, Zhou Chuanfa, Zhao Yongnian, and Shen Weiqing. According to their confessions, Liu Wenkui (also known as Xiao Wuzi) and Zhao Kai Four were the leaders, Rong Tiancai was responsible for redeeming the rickshaws, and Tang Xiaoshunzi and Wang Longcheng were responsible for posing as passengers, calling for a rickshaw to the agreed-upon destination, asking the rickshaw puller to stop, and then going into the alley to get the fare. Zhi and Zhou were specifically responsible for stealing the rickshaws. The ring was located in a Western-style house at No. 167 Haig Road in the French Concession, and Shen Weiqing, who watched the alley there, and his accomplice Zhao Yongnian were specifically responsible for the vehicles in the ring. After obtaining their confessions, the detectives went to the ring and seized two stolen rickshaws. Then, they went to the addresses to arrest the leaders Liu and Zhao and the five accomplices Rong Tiancai, Tang Xiaoshunzi, and Wang Longcheng. All of them had fled. Therefore, the four suspects Zhi, Zhou, Zhao, and Shen were thoroughly investigated. Yesterday, twelve victims of the stolen rickshaws were summoned, and the four suspects Zhi and others were escorted to the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, where Judge Li Changnian interrogated them. Gu Shouxi, the police lawyer, explained the case and requested that it be investigated and handled as a continuous theft for habitual criminals. Then, the twelve plaintiffs testified one by one about the details of their stolen rickshaws. When asked, the defendants confessed to the theft and guarding without denying it. After verifying the confessions in court, it was announced that the hearing would be adjourned to the 28th. The defendants were sent back to custody.</p>
<h3>A Gasoline Boat Robbed at the Intersection of Shangsong River Ports</h3>
<p>Cash, Silver Dollars, Gold Rings, and Clothing Were Robbed</p>
<p>Yesterday evening, the Shanghai Ma Eight-Mark gasoline boat was sailing from Xujiahui to Sijing. When it passed through the intersection of the Shangsong two county river ports, it was robbed by six or seven bandits. They used a small boat to swarm onto the boat, each holding guns and weapons. They locked the captain and sailors in a room and searched for stolen goods. They robbed cash, silver dollars, gold rings, clothing, and other items. After the thieves obtained the stolen goods, they shouted and returned to their original boat and fled. Afterwards, the captain of the boat filed a report with the local Public Security Bureau requesting an investigation.</p>
<h3>A Young Girl Died Wrongfully</h3>
<p>Died from Mistakenly Taking Poisonous Juice</p>
<p>Verified by the Court Yesterday</p>
<p>Wu Li, a widow from Ningbo, was 49 years old and had a daughter named Rongmei, who was 14 years old. They lived together at No. 103 Yuanji Lane, Tangshan Road. The mother and daughter used to work in a nearby silk factory to make a living. However, the factory suddenly closed down recently, causing them to lose their jobs. Ms. Wu also suffered from lung disease, which she had not been able to cure. She was plagued by poverty and illness and was in great pain. On the 21st of this month, out of resentment, she suddenly had the idea of taking her own life. She secretly bought opium and mixed it with sugar juice and swallowed more than half of it while hidden from other people, lying in bed waiting to die. However, at around 11 o'clock that night, her daughter, feeling thirsty, saw a teacup placed on the table and mistakenly thought it contained cold water. She didn't know that it was the remaining opium and sugar juice that her mother had swallowed, so she drank it all. Before long, the poison took effect, and she cried out in panic. Wang Arong, who lived with them, heard the sound and went to investigate and discovered that both the mother and daughter had been poisoned. She immediately reported it to the Huishan Police Station, which ordered Chinese detective Xu Decheng to rush to the scene. After investigation, an ambulance was summoned to send them to Tongren Hospital, and then transferred to Guangren Hospital for treatment. Rong Tian died of poisoning in her lungs at 2:40 PM the day before yesterday. Her life was also in great danger and is currently being saved. The detective then carried Rongmei's body to the forensic laboratory on Fielun Road. Yesterday morning, he reported to the First Special District Local Court and appointed Prosecutor Song Genshan, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan, clerk Wang Zuyi, and others to examine the body. According to the detectives' report on the previous situation, Yu Chen, 22 years old, from Ningbo, who lived at No. 89 Fuhua Lane, Dongyouheng Road, was an old neighbor and fellow villager of Wu Li and had learned of her daughter's death. She had collected funds for a coffin and was willing to claim the body. Mr. Song obtained the confession and ordered that the deceased Wu Rongmei, a female, was confirmed to have died from taking opium poison before death. The corpse was allowed to be claimed by Yu Chen after providing a guarantee for coffin and burial.</p>
<h3>Radio Salesman Arrested for Private Use of Funds</h3>
<p>Taken Back to Shanghai from Hangzhou</p>
<p>Chen Zhengxi, a native of Jiangxi, 34 years old, was the general radio salesman at the Philips Electric Company at No. 123 Sichuan Road. He had been in the position for six years. Last December, the company found that Chen had privately collected and used funds amounting to 99,105 yuan and 8 cents. Chen also fled without a trace at this time. A reward of 1,000 yuan was offered by the General Police Station for his arrest. It has now been learned by the Chinese detectives Yue Gengbiao and Gao Yanrong of the police station that Chen is now working at the Jianqiao Aviation Manufacturing Plant in Hangzhou. They obtained an official document and wanted notice No. 554 from the First Special District Court, went to Hang County, and, together with the local police, arrested Chen. With the approval of the Hang County Local Court Prosecutor's Office, he was transferred and brought back to Shanghai at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Wang Yaotang, the police lawyer, requested an extension, saying that the investigation was not yet complete. When Chen Zhengxi was questioned, he admitted that a portion of the funds was indeed used by him and retained lawyer Huang Zongxun to request bail. Judge Feng Shide verified the report and announced that the hearing would be adjourned for one week. The application for bail will be reviewed after a formal application is submitted to the court.</p>
<h3>Kuang Baoying and Others Accused of Aiding in Tax Evasion</h3>
<p>Each Fined 300 Yuan</p>
<p>The Public Works Department's Revenue Office recently discovered that Kuang Zhongji's rental accounting firm had helped its tenant, the Yourixin Bathhouse at No. 21 Meiren Lane, Hankou Road, to fraudulently reduce the amount of patrol tax payable. It reported it to the General Office for investigation and ordered Chinese detective Chen Yonggui and Western detective chief Beibeining to investigate. They sued the owners Kuang Baoying and Kuang Menghuai for fraud in the First Special District Court. They have already been summoned once, and the details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Dai Rongduo of the First Special Court continued the hearing in the Second Criminal Division. The two defendants were both present. According to Kuang Baoying, the rental matters were entirely managed by his cousin Menghuai, and he did not advise him. The contract of Yourixin was signed by me on behalf of my father, and I don't know anything else. When asked, Kuang Menghuai stated that the reason why our rent receipt was issued twice a month was that Yourixin's business was not good and could not be paid in full at one time. It had to be paid in two installments each month, so the rent receipt was issued in two installments of 150 yuan each. The housing tax was paid by Yourixin. It was not up to me how they evaded the tax. He also presented a book of accounts to prove it. The court questioned him, and then ordered the commencement of arguments. Qian Xunjiu, the lawyer of the Public Works Department, attacked the account book presented by the defendant, saying that the account book was established in February of last year and has been more than a year old, but it is still brand new. Furthermore, the handwriting inside is completely the same ink color from beginning to end, so it is indeed suspicious and cannot be used as evidence. He also asked the court to impose severe punishment to deter others from following suit. After the defendant's lawyer defended, Judge Dai announced the verdict in court, stating that Kuang Baoying and Kuang Menghuai had aided in obtaining illegal property benefits through fraudulent means and were each fined 300 yuan. If they were unable to pay, they would be converted to one day of labor for every two yuan.</p>

They were all from Pudong and Fengnan. They also seized two pistols, more than 20 bullets, diamond rings, gold bracelets, gold circles, handcuffs, iron chains, and a savings book from the Bank of China with a deposit of 1,050 yuan. They were escorted to the Second Special Court for interrogation and detention. After investigation, seven men and women who were not involved were released first. The six people, Han, Wang, Jiang, Li, Ma, and Chen, had successively robbed the Chen Xing family at No. 5 Ximen Lane, Ximen Road, and the Xu Zhengbing and Wang Yongliang families at No. 63 of the same lane in the French Concession. The stolen jewelry seized was the property lost by the Chen Xing family. Also seized were thick and thin fur coats, which were the property of the Xu and Wang families. On the morning of April 19, they attempted to kidnap Lu Fugen, the owner of the Lu Gentai Western-style women's clothing store at No. 101 Gucha Road, but failed. They also committed several kidnapping cases in the mainland. The savings book was the money obtained from the ransom. The police department prosecuted them for robbery under the criminal law, attempted kidnapping for ransom, and privately possessing military firearms. Judge Zhang Chaozuo summoned the victims, opened a court hearing several times for deliberation and concluded, and scheduled a date for sentencing. The details have been reported in this newspaper.

<h3>Guangdong Woman Zhu Jianren Involved in a Lawsuit as a Wet Nurse</h3>
<p>The Judge Clarified That It Should Be a Civil Case, Not Criminal Fraud or Breach of Trust</p>
<p>Zhu Jianren, a 34-year-old Guangdong woman living at No. 517 Laita Road in the French Concession, gave birth to a child at Renhe Hospital on October 22. She entrusted her relative Guo Tiaomei to recruit more than ten wet nurses and asked a doctor to examine them. Wu, a young woman from Yangzhou sent by Zhou Nanshan's Jinlao Matchmaker Shop at No. 202 Julaita Road, was found to have thick milk and a strong physique, and was considered suitable for feeding the child. After officially hiring her, Wu's milk became short after a week and was not enough for the child's consumption. It was also discovered that Wu secretly squeezed and discarded the milk, which led to a dispute. Zhu asked her to return her wages and hired another wet nurse. Because Wu refused, the matchmaker shop owner ignored her and took Wu away. The mother Zhu Jianren expressed her dissatisfaction and appointed lawyer Guo Tiaomei as her agent. She filed a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, accusing matchmaker Zhou Nanshan and Wu of fraud and breach of trust, requesting an investigation and also including a civil lawsuit, requesting the recovery of five months of prepaid wages, 7 yuan per month, and inspection fees and matchmaker introduction fees, totaling 47.8 yuan. After Judge Wang Gangxu, the Chief of the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, opened a court hearing, he announced the conclusion and ruled Zhou Nanshan and Wu not guilty yesterday at 3:30 PM. The civil lawsuit of the plaintiff was dismissed. The court also explained that after the trial, this case belonged to a civil employment contract relationship and could not constitute criminal fraud or breach of trust. It should be filed with the Civil Division. The self-appointed agent requested the return of the receipts for the bonds presented in the last case, which the court approved and returned in court.</p>

<h3>Resumption of Business at the Ningbo Industrial Bank: Repayment of Savings Deposits in Batches</h3>
<p>20% Cash Repayment for Amounts Under 500 Yuan, Subject to Notification Letter for Collection at Preparation Office</p>
<p>The Ningbo Industrial Bank Resumption of Business Preparation Office, which has been issuing 20% cash, 30% in term deposits (two-year term), and 50% in stock certificates to savings account holders at the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association on Xizang Road, has already been reported in detail by this newspaper. It is now learned that the second batch of repayments for savings accounts under 500 yuan has commenced. However, due to the large number of accounts, to avoid crowding by claimants, the same method as the first batch will be used, with each depositor receiving a notification letter for claiming funds. Therefore, the repayment office has posted a notice stating that depositors must bring the notification letter to claim funds, and those who have not received a notification letter will be refused repayment to avoid wasted trips. As for depositors with mortgaged accounts and deposits from the Ministry of Commerce, these will be handled separately after business resumption according to the agreed-upon methods, as reconciliation of accounts is required. It is also heard that the repayment procedures are quite complicated, and it has now been decided that repayments will be suspended every Sunday to focus on disaster relief work, but the pawned goods purchasing department will remain open as usual.</p>
<h3>Shanghai County to Reduce Field Tax by 10%</h3>
<p>Due to the poor autumn harvest in Shanghai County, members of the civil affairs, finance, and construction departments, Xu Yuyin, Xu Shiyao, and Yao Yongping, have completed their re-inspection of various districts and reported to the provincial government for approval. With the approval of the provincial government based on the report from the Finance Department, the field tax in this county will be reduced by 10% to alleviate the people's hardship. The county government has been ordered to comply immediately. The comparative table of the autumn harvest assessments for the past three years in Shanghai County is as follows: 21st year, full tax levied; 22nd year, 8% general reduction, actual levy 92%; 23rd year, 5% general reduction, actual levy 95%.</p>
<h3>Preparations for Establishing a Temporary Anti-Smoking Hospital: Discussions Among Various Bureaus</h3>
<p>Location to be Changed to the National Games Venue; Operation to Commence After Concrete Decisions</p>
<p>Regarding the establishment of a temporary anti-smoking hospital, the municipal government, through Section Chief Zhu of the Third Section, convened representatives from the Public Security Bureau, Health Bureau, and Finance Bureau at the municipal government at 2:00 PM the day before yesterday for a discussion. Section Chief Zhu chaired the meeting and, after reporting the purpose of the meeting, discussions were held. As a result of the mutual consultations, it was generally agreed that, given the municipal treasury's current financial constraints, raising the original estimated budget of over 70,000 yuan for establishing the anti-smoking hospital would be difficult. Therefore, it was proposed to slightly reduce the original budget. Regarding the location, if the Gaojing Temple Memorial New Village is not used and the National Games venue is used instead, the costs of repairs, water, and electricity can be reduced by 10,000 yuan. Other expenses, such as those for doctors, staff, and office expenses, can also be appropriately reduced based on the circumstances. In this way, the costs can be reduced by a considerable amount, and the establishment of the anti-smoking hospital can be realized sooner. However, as this matter involves many bureaus, it is expected that operation will commence as soon as the authorities make concrete decisions in the shortest possible time.</p>

<p>Seizes Two Browning Double-Barreled Pistols; Interrogation of Confessions Continues Until Dawn</p>
<p>Recently, there have been eight or nine major and minor robberies in Zhabei, none of which have been solved. Therefore, Cai Jinjun, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and Ji Yuanpu and Xia Huibai, the chief and deputy chiefs of the Detective Team, were very angry. Therefore, they specifically ordered Bao Ziying, Captain of the Xinzha Detective Sub-Team, to solve the case as soon as possible. Captain Bao also worried about this day and night. He offered a high reward and ordered the subordinate team leaders and detectives to seek clues everywhere. At around 2:00 AM yesterday, Deputy Team Leader Li Guiqing suddenly received information from a secret informant, Lu Jinkang, that a robbery gang consisting of Ding Yaozhang, Dai Baolong, and others was hiding at No. 30 Yongxiang Lane, Datong Road.

<h3>Land Bureau: Procedures for Issuing Land Ownership Certificates</h3>
<p>First Obtain a Numbered Ticket, Then Collect Certificate in Order</p>
<p>In order to expedite the issuance of land ownership certificates, the Land Bureau is working day and night to produce the backlog of over 3,000 land certificates. They will be ready for issuance soon. However, the Land Bureau is concerned that certificate holders will rush and crowd to collect their certificates. In order to maintain order, the Land Bureau will first issue numbered tickets. Anyone coming to collect a certificate will be given a numbered ticket at the certificate collection office, and then certificates will be issued in order. It is heard that this will be implemented starting next Monday (the 25th of this month). The procedures for issuing tickets and collecting certificates are as follows: 1. To facilitate the public in exchanging land certificates, this Bureau will issue numbered tickets in the order of arrival and exchange land certificates accordingly. 2. The numbered tickets in the preceding article will be issued by the inquiry office of this Bureau in the order of arrival. 3. From No. 1 onwards, in order, go to the certificate issuing room for verification. If the certificate is not yet ready, the certificate issuing room shall take back the numbered ticket and stamp the ticket with the mark "Certificate Not Yet Ready" and send it back to the cashier's office. After the previous numbered ticket is taken back by the cashier's office, it should verify and collect the payment notification slip for the following numbered ticket in advance. For example, if the certificate for No. 2 is not yet ready, the payment for ticket No. 3 and onwards should be collected in advance. 4. The certificate issuing room may advance the verification of other numbered tickets in order to avoid delaying the time for other tickets to exchange certificates due to the time required for verification. The procedure should be handled in accordance with Article 3. 5. Once the land certificate has been prepared, the certificate issuing room will issue a payment notification slip for payment at the cashier's office in order. 6. After verifying the payment, the cashier's office will hand the receipt together with the original numbered ticket to the certificate exchanger, who will then collect the certificate from the certificate issuing room in order. 7. After completing the certificate collection, the certificate issuing room will take back the numbered ticket.</p>
<h3>Exchanging Land Ownership Certificates</h3>
<p>Obtain Receipt and Submit Film; Land Bureau Announces Nine Procedures</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Land Bureau of this city has procedures for exchanging certificates. When the public comes to the bureau to exchange certificates, they must submit the field deed or important evidence for verification before being allowed to exchange for a receipt and go to collect the certificate at the specified time. However, because the Land Bureau needs to examine, draw maps, and create certificates for the land area for which the public is exchanging certificates, it takes considerable time before the certificate can be collected. The original owners are unable to use the original certificates temporarily or due to other reasons during this period. The Land Bureau is now implementing ten procedures for the public to reclaim their deeds and submit films for safekeeping after registration, in order to further benefit the public, with reference to the land registration held in Guangzhou, where the public submits property certificates, photographs are stored, and the original certificates are returned. The procedures have been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and promulgation and will be implemented immediately. The procedures are appended below:</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau Implementation Procedures for Reclaiming Deeds and Submitting Films: Article 1. In order to facilitate the public in reclaiming their deeds and keeping films, this Bureau has a deed photography office, and each item is allowed to be charged a photography fee by the photography office. The fee schedule will be determined separately. Article 2. If the public does not want to keep the deeds or other important evidence submitted for verification when applying for a land ownership certificate in this Bureau, they must take clear film of the deeds or other important evidence at the deed photography office of this Bureau and submit it to the Bureau for verification. Article 3. When the public submits deeds or other important evidence, they must submit the original deed or other important evidence for verification. After the deed section of the fourth section of this Bureau has verified that they are consistent, a verification stamp will be affixed to the back of the deed or other important evidence, indicating the date, numbering, and the back of the film will be stamped with the date of receipt and numbering. After completing the photography, numbering, and stamping procedures, it will be returned immediately, and the receipt and presentation document will be marked "Returned, Deed or Other Evidence Retained on Film" for reference. However, if the public does not want to photograph and submit deeds or other important evidence, they should still submit the deeds or other important evidence to this Bureau. Article 4. When issuing the land ownership certificate, the original deeds and other important evidence should be brought for re-verification. If there are no errors, the field deed will be cancelled and filed in accordance with Article 8 of the Owners' Fee Payment Guidelines, and other evidence will be returned. Article 5. If a dispute arises over ownership or other disputes occur, and it is necessary to verify the deeds or other evidence, an order will be issued to submit them. If they are not submitted after two notices, a public notice will be issued setting a deadline of two weeks for submitting the above documents. If they are still not submitted by the deadline, the statement made by the other party will be considered a fact. Article 6. If it is necessary to verify the authenticity of the deeds or other evidence, an order will be issued to submit them in accordance with the provisions of the preceding article. If they are still not submitted by the deadline, the film will be reviewed and the results will be announced. Article 7. If the field deed or other important evidence submitted by the public is deemed to be a special case where it is necessary to keep the field deed or other important evidence, and it is not possible to keep only the film, it will be retained by this Bureau after approval by the Director. Article 8. One staff member of the deed section of the fourth section of this Bureau will be stationed at the reception desk to review the presented deeds and other important evidence in accordance with the provisions of Articles 1, 2, and 7 of these procedures. Article 9. This Bureau may amend these procedures at any time and submit them to the Municipal Government for approval and implementation. Article 10.

<p>Gu Zhuxuan, the owner of the Tianchan Stage and a native of Yancheng, was implicated in the assassination of Tang Jiapeng, the former manager of the Great World. The arrested criminal Zhao Guangfu confessed that Gu had instigated the murder. The Bureau of Legal Police arrested Gu on September 10 and sent him to the Second Special District Court, charging him with instigating murder.

Emulating the established rules of friendly nations and establishing a major plan to save the country, various decrees to prevent speculation and manipulation to raise prices have been promulgated, all of which are pertinent to the current situation and can save industry and commerce. From now on, the use of legal tender to control international exchange rates will seek to balance imports and exports, establish national warehouses everywhere, implement mortgage loans, and provide relief to rural areas, factories, and shops, so that legal tender is smooth, the economy is active, issuance is strictly managed, and cost accounting is rigorously implemented to organize industrial control committees and commercial control committees to estimate the cost of factory products, assess standard prices, so that industrial and commercial enterprises comply together, neither allowing high prices nor allowing price-cutting competition, using unlimited legal tender as collateral for loans, controlling organized agriculture, industry, and commerce, and the hope of revitalization can be counted on. The proposals are drafted as follows (see separate record). The above eight proposals are a fundamental plan for revitalizing industry and commerce by using legal tender. I respectfully offer my humble opinions to the best of my ability. I respectfully request your Ministry to review and adopt them, and to promulgate the laws and regulations for controlling industry and commerce as soon as possible, so that the League can urge the respective industries to proceed in accordance with the law, and all can be changed to organized, statistical, and scientific management, so that factories can assist your Ministry's revitalization plan, and also request that the Bank of Communications, the National Goods Bank, and the Shanghai Commercial Bank first accept national goods as collateral for loans, so that the economies of various factories can use legal tender and become more active, in order to achieve the goal of realizing the entire plan one by one, and I am overwhelmed with anticipation.</p>
<p>Eight Proposals The League requests the authorities to implement the following eight items: (1) Amend the regulations for real estate mortgage loans. Please promulgate the real estate mortgage loan regulations immediately. Only the Central Trust Bureau is authorized to handle this, and it is feared that it will be insufficient. Please designate the Bank of China and other banks to specialize in real estate mortgage loans. (2) National goods factory goods mortgage loans. Please designate the Bank of Communications, the National Goods Bank, the Shanghai Commercial Savings Bank, and other banks to specialize in goods mortgage loans. (3) Establish national warehouses everywhere. Before they are completed, temporarily designate several existing warehouses as substitute national warehouses. The mortgaged goods can be redeemed in batches at any time. The warehouse regulations must be simple and flexible so that factories can easily circulate. (4) The mortgage loan interest rate should be set at 3% per week, but no more than 4%, according to the established rules of friendly nations. (5) Establish an industrial control committee, rigorously implement a cost accounting system, and establish scientific management methods for all factories, regardless of size, strictly crack down on shoddy manufacturing, control production, assess standard market prices, and announce and notify all factories to comply together every day. If there is any violation of the regulations, after the decision of the control committee, report to the competent authority for severe sanctions. (6) Establish a commercial control committee, rigorously implement a cost accounting system, prevent foreign goods from being dumped at low prices, restrict large price-cutting sales, assess standard market prices, and announce and notify all shops in the industry to comply together every day. If there is any violation of the regulations or damage to the revitalization plan, after the decision of the control committee, report to the competent authority and severely punish it in accordance with the Emergency Law for Punishing Those Who Endanger the Republic of China. (7) The organization of the industrial and commercial control committee should be formulated by the Ministry of Industry separately, and promulgated as a ministerial order as soon as possible, and all industries and businesses should be organized and established within two months, and reported to the competent authority for record. (8) Organizations that violate the industrial and commercial control regulations shall not enjoy the right to mortgage loans. If there is any damage to the entire revitalization plan, and the circumstances are serious, after investigation, after the decision of the control committee, report to the competent authority and severely punish it in accordance with the Emergency Law for Punishing Those Who Endanger the Republic of China.</p>

<h3>Youyou's Maiden Game: 5-0 Victory Over Western Police</h3>
<p>Black Charcoal Majestic, Full of Activity; Western Police Goalkeeper Punished for Committing Offense</p>
<p>The Youyou First Division Football Team made its first appearance in this year's Western League First Division match yesterday. It was a hit, defeating the Western Police 5-0. The weather was not good, and there were very few spectators in Yiyuan. Youyou's forward line, with the return of Xiao Heitan (Black Charcoal), was exceptionally active. The Western Police are getting worse and worse, old and withering, not as vigorous as they were a few years ago, old and clumsy, how can they not be defeated? In addition, when the first half was about to end, right inside forward Heitelay left the field due to injury, and goalkeeper Amos was also penalized for committing an offense. In the first half, Youyou took the lead 4-0. In the second half, the Western Police fought with nine men, and the whole army defended hard. Youyou only scored one goal.</p>
<p>Black Charcoal Opens the Record with a Twelve-Yard Kick</p>
<p>At 3:15, with a whistle from the referee, the two teams lined up. Youyou launched an attack to the west. Chen Zhenhe dribbled the ball deep into the Western Police's territory. Hughte killed out to defend. O'Clennan galloped and passed to the center. Zhang Fei had eyes on the top of his head. Turner took the opportunity to shoot, but missed slightly. Da Zhong dribbled in, but was suddenly blocked by Helei and had to retreat temporarily. The opportunity came. Zhong Yuxiang led the team forward. Crawford committed a foul and was penalized with a twelve-yard kick. Charcoal King took the penalty and opened the record.</p>
<p>Xu Jingcheng's Unexpected Thunderbolt</p>
<p>Dawei led the army and attacked Youyou's position, breaking through the border pass of Charcoal King. Jiang Shanjing quickly arrived and kicked the ball out for a corner kick, turning the danger into safety. The two sides fought again, but there was no progress. The Flying General descended from the sky. Xu Jingcheng seized the opportunity to kill out and fired a cold arrow from 30 yards away, rolling on the ground. When the ball fell into the net, Amos regretted it too late, and the gate went bankrupt for the second time.</p>
<p>Wang Nanzhen Creates 3-0</p>
<p>Turner received Helei's pass and passed it to Dawei. As soon as he said it, Zhang Fei had already taken the initiative to kick it out. The Western Police continued to work hard and attacked again. Chen Zhenxiang committed a foul and was penalized. Mann took the penalty. At the start of Mao Tui, the ball was like an arrow leaving the bowstring. Xiao Zhang held A Dou calmly. Mann returned without success. Wang Nanzhen started an uprising in the south. Da Zhong did not disgrace his mission and sent a pass to Charcoal King in front of the goal. Charcoal King made a shot, and it was done.</p>
<p>Black Charcoal Adds Flowers to the Brocade</p>
<p>The Western Police are always under threat. Youyou's central officer Xiao Zhong ordered the attack and broke through the three passes of the Western Police. The captors were unwilling to be outdone and sent troops to meet them. Xiao Zhong sold a flaw and passed lightly to Charcoal King. He dribbled past Crawford. The goalkeeper rushed out to rescue. Seeing the fierce attack, Charcoal King swept the ground, the gate was empty, and the ball had entered the net. Youyou won four goals.</p>
<p>Western Police Goalkeeper Punished for Committing Offense</p>
<p>Mao Hongfa increased troops on the north road. Da Zhong responded effectively. Xiao Zhong missed slightly. O'Clair attacked with the ball, but was too hasty and fell injured and left the field. Da Zhong tested his feet at the door, and Amos took out a dangerous ball. Xiao Mao arrived, and Amos was ashamed and angry, raised his palm and struck hard. The referee was selfless. Edmon's actions were rude and he was sent off the field, replaced by Helei. The first half ended, and Youyou had a net win of four goals.</p>
<p>Nine Men Fight Again, Breaking Through One More Pass</p>
<p>After Mengguo, they changed places to fight again. The Western Police had only nine men left. Chen Zhenhe shot a single spear and horse, split the three passes, and went straight to Huanglong. Helei acted as a guest gatekeeper, performing well, saving dangerous balls. Da Zhong shouted on the border defense and attacked the gate, but unfortunately the middle door bounced back. Chen Zhenhe was ordered to attack the west. Crawford could not stop him and passed it to Xu Jingcheng. Xu turned around and shot angrily, and hit the bullseye again. Before long, Hu Su Gao Ming, Youyou triumphantly returned. The lineups of both sides are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Western League Third Division Football Match: Qinghua Wins Big Over Soviet Shell</h3>
<p>Winning This Year's Championship Is Like Taking Something Out of a Pocket; Soviet Shell Is Unable to Cope 3-0</p>
<p>Qinghua and Soviet Shell, the two heroes of the Western League Third Division, played two group matches at Shenyuan Stadium at 3:00 pm yesterday. Both teams have won two games and two wins. This victory or defeat is crucial to the championship, so each team went all out to compete. However, the Russian overseas Chinese team Chang, who entered the A-group division to fight, was still unable to stop the strong Qinghua team. The Russian army had no ability to counterattack and became a one-sided situation. In the end, Qinghua won 3-0, and winning the two-group championship this year is like taking something out of a pocket. The lake was cold and freezing yesterday, and there was no one in the Shenyuan stadium. It was twice as tragic, because all the fans were attracted to Yiyuan by Youyou. The battle details are as follows:</p>
<p>Shenghua Kicks</p>
<p>Open the Record</p>
<p>Referee Zhu Qiu sounded the personnel. The Russian overseas Chinese position was quite tense. Qinghua occupied the advantage of the wind. Although there was a good opportunity, the stalemate lasted for 20 minutes, and there was still no progress. Qinghua was inspired by each individual. Lin Zuochu got a pass from Liao Shiming at the baseline and passed it into the middle. Xuan Shenghua was waiting for it. The Russian gate rushed out to rescue, but collided with Shenghua, and the ball leaked through his legs into the net, opening the record. The kickoff on the middle line, Qinghua iron cavalry will meet through the Russian position, Lin Zuochu's baseline hook turn is just right, the Russian door pounced on it and held it, and did not cause a major disaster. The ball passed the middle line, and Qinghua's gate began to heat up. Zeng Wenying forced a corner kick, but Ketuo Kofu opened it without purpose, and did not fly anywhere. A pair of one ended the first half.</p>
<p>Russian Army in the</p>
<p>Leading Branch Mansion</p>
<p>After the stick, start again. Qinghua's five cavalry advanced together, and Hu Xuan joined forces to approach. Xuan Shenghua flew up and kicked, urgently and sharply, and flew straight to the left corner of the Russian gate. Chailinik watched it enter the net and could not save it. This ball was less than half a minute after the stick. After this setback, the Russian army bravely counterattacked. The central defender Xiesinikefu was short in stature and his foot was unusually crisp, but it was a pity that one wood could not support the mansion and was eventually heavily oppressed by Qinghua. However, the field was too slippery, and many good opportunities were lost. Xuan Shenghua attacked the door three times, and the landing point was excellent. However, the Russian gate was lifted into a corner kick. Hu Limin lost the opportunity to open it, and Aiba Liluofu rushed straight in alone, a high ball, Wang Jingen caught it, but Wang held the ball in his hand and was too leisurely. He was surrounded by three Russian forwards, and another slip under his feet fell to the ground. He was in danger of being attacked. Xin Cao Wenzheng was wise and followed Zhao, and rescued A Dou.</p>
<p>—Twelve-Yard Ball</p>
<p>Jiliang Lost the Opportunity</p>
<p>Qinghua's dangerous situation had just passed, and good luck came again. Du Zuoshi rose from the frontier, passed through the three passes, and the baseline passed in the middle with an excellent landing point. Jia Jiliang caught up and kicked it, and Chailinik could only sigh in vain. With a score of 3-0, Qinghua's momentum was brilliant and invincible. After this, he was content and the attack was inevitably careless, losing many opportunities. The Russian gate repeatedly presented dangerous signs, but was able to turn the danger into safety. Once, the Russian guard committed a foul, and Jia Jiliang took the twelve-yard penalty, cutting the crossbar, and the Russian gate was lifted into a corner kick. Xuan Shenghua's left-wing government door wiped the vortex door post. Liao Shiming caught up but could not reach it, losing the opportunity. Xingming then attacked the various lines remotely, landing under the crossbar, only inches away from the white line. Chailinik missed the ball, but Qinghua lacked a receiver, so he failed to enter the net. The Russian army's power attacked, but fortunately Qinghua's guards were effective and were not broken, so the whole game ended with a score of 3-0. The lineups of both teams are as follows:</p>
<p>Qinghua</p>
<p>Wang Jingen</p>
<p>Cao Wenying Hu Biyao</p>
<p>Chen Xiaoping Wang Boyong Yu Qiaxing</p>
<p>Hu Liming Xuan Shenghua Jia Jiliang Liao Shiming Lin Zuoshi</p>

<p>Children's Educational Novel</p>
<h3>Little Men (1) (0) (4)</h3>
<p>—Original by Louisa M. Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>"I can't help but let these little fellows go, because I can't keep them in the house," Don said, clearly showing his regret.</p>
<p>"I'll take care of them for you, just tell me how to do it, and they can live in my turtle pond," said Xiaobiao, who found them more interesting than his slow-moving turtle friends. So Don told him their needs and habits, and Xiaobiao took them away, preparing to take them to their new home and introduce them to their neighbor. "What a good boy he is!" Don said, carefully tending to the butterfly, suddenly remembering that Xiaobiao had sacrificed his walk today to return the butterfly.</p>
<p>"He should be, because they haven't spared the effort they put into him."</p>
<p>"He has parents, relatives, and others to guide and help him, but I don't," said Don, sighing as he thought of his own unsupervised childhood—a rare gesture for him—and feeling as if he hadn't received fair treatment in the world.</p>
<p>"I know, good boy, and for that reason, I don't expect as much from you as I expect from Xiaobiao, even though he is younger: we are willing to do our best to help you, and to teach you how to help yourself. Don't you remember when Uncle Pei told you last time you were here how to set your mind on doing good, and even to pray to God to help you?"</p>

<h3>Finance: Customs Gold Unit Opens Small, Gold Market Disappoints Many Long Positions, Exchange Market Strong with Large Sales from Huada, Retreats Seven Yuan, Trend Still Oscillating</h3>
<p>The gold market was disappointed yesterday as the Customs Gold Unit opened small, shaking the confidence of many long positions overnight, who then closed out their positions. Unfavorable news from Hong Kong further loosened the local exchange market, activating selling pressure and leading to a decline. British American Tobacco settled forward shillings, eventually stabilizing slightly. The morning began with the overseas silver market showing a slight rise in exchange rates as London spot gold fell, US rates remained stable, and Mondeieri forward silver prices remained unchanged to a decline of two and a half points. Unfavorable overseas news, coupled with the Central Bank's official rate announcements, showing no change in both British and US rates, and the Customs Gold Unit falling five cents, dampened market sentiment. Pre-market trading opened at sixty yuan, immediately falling before trending upward. Banks rushed to sell, but as Mobil Oil settled forward US dollars, the HSBC official rate announcements showed no change in both British and US rates, stabilizing halfway through, although there were many short positions. The announcement of the silver equalization tax showing a decline of 25 points further exhausted market sentiment. The Hong Kong market strengthened, with Reuters reporting that no one was buying British rates below one shilling and six pence and ten points, fueling selling pressure, which also loosened the exchange market. The Guanggang Hengxing came to sell, causing supply to exceed demand in the market, briefly falling to 1,150 yuan before buyers emerged. British American Tobacco settled a significant amount of spot shillings, predicting that Indian silver would decline by a small amount of three annas, gradually improving. However, as Hong Kong rates loosened to one shilling and six pence and one hundred and seventy-five points, it was difficult to sustain, and there was a slight decline. At noon, the overall trend stabilized, again oscillating. Observing the trend, it is still expected to oscillate. Although the settlement price was within 1,150 yuan, the swap was offered by many at more than ten yuan. A summary of the market situation for half a day is as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opened at 1,159 yuan and three cents, a decline of one yuan and two cents compared to the previous closing. Dadecheng Fuxing Yongdefa Yongbu and others immediately sold down to seven yuan and three cents. Hengyu Yongli Zhenzou Shangna rose to eight yuan and one cent. Anticipating the HSBC official rate announcements, with no change in both British and US rates, there was no effect. Dadecheng Chunyuan Yongdeli Hengchang Yonghengyu Huixiang Zhichang sold, further falling to five yuan and two cents. Jiekuan Shangyin Yongli Dadecheng Fuyu Xingmao Yongde took advantage of the low price to maintain the trend, rising to six yuan and six cents. The announcement of the equalization tax showing a decline of 25 points, Dadecheng Hengxing Hengchang Yong small retail accounts sold, falling to four yuan and two cents. Although Chunyuan Yong Fuxing Yong rose to five yuan, unfavorable news from Hong Kong, with Reuters reporting that there were no buyers below one shilling and six pence, Yiyu Yifeng Yongyuan Mao Yonghengyu Futai Yongshunmao all sold, falling to three yuan and a half. Yuanmao Yong Huixiang Yifeng Yong took advantage of the low price to maintain the trend, rising to four yuan and nine cents. Citibank Yong January US dollars 4,375, Dadecheng Fuxing Yong Yifeng Yong Yingxiang Tongtaichang followed the trend, falling to two yuan and one cent. Although Fuxing Yong Yifeng Yonghengyu advanced to three yuan, Fuxing Yong Dadecheng Fushengyu Huixiang resold, falling to one yuan. Chunyuan Yong Yuanmao Yong Yifeng Yong Fuxing Yong Yongli took advantage of the low price to maintain, British American Tobacco settled a significant amount of shillings, rising back to two yuan and four cents. Hengxing supplied from time to time, retreating to two yuan and eight cents. Fuxing Yong then made efforts to purchase, small retail accounts also followed, predicting that Indian silver would decline by three annas, rising to four yuan and a half. Hengchang Yong Chunyuan Yong Su Xinxiang took advantage of the high price to sell, retreating to two yuan and seven cents. Qingfa Yong Tongfu Houyu Shangna closed at noon at 1,153 yuan and a half, peaceful after the close.</p>
<p>The closing price, based on the Central Bank's standard gold price, was posted at 1,148 yuan and six cents, roughly five yuan higher than the closing price, five yuan less than the previous close. The registration price for December was 1,141 yuan, and for January, 1,154 yuan. The morning replenishing price was 1,141 yuan. The price of pure gold was reduced by six yuan to 1,153 yuan and three cents. The spot market was stable. Tianjin goods were reduced by three yuan, and refined gold was reduced by two to three yuan, with a lack of transactions. For swaps, Dingtai paid Fu'an fourteen points, at eleven yuan and two cents, Qianchangxiang paid Chunyuan Yong thirty-five points, at twelve yuan, Yicheng twenty-eight points, at eleven yuan and eight cents, Dingtai paid Yuanchang Yong fourteen points, at twelve yuan and a half. After entering, Hengxing Yuanmao Yong and others were willing to pay in advance, but transactions were difficult.</p>
<p>The market trading was mediocre, less active than in the previous few days. In total, Shenfeng Chunyuan Yong Shunmao Yicheng Hengchang Shui Fuxing Yong Qingfa Shui Yifeng Yong and others were on the buying side, while Dadecheng Hengxing Fengchang Qianchangxiang Fuyu Yuxinxiang Huixiang Dingkang Richang Tongtaichang and others were on the selling side.

<h3>Hong Kong Market Looseness, Local Foreign Exchange Steadily Hardening</h3>

The Central Bank's listed exchange rates were announced, showing no change for either the British Pound or US Dollar. Customs Gold Unit decreased by 5%. Market sentiment was weak, and there was no sustained support after the opening. Banks rushed to sell, but the Mobil Oil Company actively purchased, anticipating that the HSBC's listed exchange rates for both the British Pound and US Dollar would remain unchanged. There was much fluctuation in between. Later, the Silver Equalization Tax was announced, decreasing by 0.25, further dampening market sentiment. Chinese merchants settled near-term positions, and the Hong Kong market also hardened. Moreover, Reuters reported that there were few buyers for Hong Kong Dollars below 1 shilling and 6 pence, causing banks to sell again, which hardened the process. However, due to the British American Tobacco Company’s heavy purchases of shillings, predictions of a 3 anna drop in Indian silver could still be supported. The Hong Kong market had already hardened to 1 shilling, 6 pence and 1875 points. By noon, the overall trend had stabilized. At the closing, the near-term selling prices were 1 shilling and 2.5 pence for the British Pound and 29.75 yuan for the US Dollar.

<h3>Securities - The Bond Market Before Settlement</h3>
<p>Only Two Days Left This Month… Short Covering and Swaps Exist, Bulls Concentrating on the 22nd Level… The Rising Trend Persists</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the November futures contracts were nearing their final day or two. The bulls, at this juncture, were already being forced into a position where they could hardly let go. A millimeter of difference could lead to a thousand miles of loss. Although the shorts had delivered 70 to 80 million in actual bonds, the bulls could only make a final stand. There were a total of three trading sessions yesterday. During the morning session, those raising prices were slightly cautious, retreating by 0.2 or 0.3 jiao to 0.7 or 0.8 jiao. The sellers were mostly from the "Four and Sixteen" groups from the north. In the second session, retail investors covered shorts or swapped positions. The market price was chaotic but firm. The bulls particularly focused on the 22nd level, so the rising trend was especially sharp, as they only knew that the discount was lower, but forgot that there was still a long period of ten and a half years remaining. At the closing, the 54 and 78 bonds were raised in price again, and retail bulls also concentrated on the 22nd level, raising the price by about one yuan. Retrenchment bonds and short-term gold bonds slightly lost 0.2 or 0.3 jiao. As a result, except for retrenchment, tobacco and short-term gold bonds, which fell by 0.2 or 0.3 jiao to 1.2 yuan, the rest were raised by 0.3, 0.5 or 0.6 jiao. The 22nd level alone rose sharply by 1.75 yuan, reappearing at a new high price. The total transaction volume was about 35 million yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>New York Stock Market Reversal and Sharp Decline</p>
<p>According to a report from Sin Fung &amp; Co., yesterday (the 22nd), the New York stock market experienced a sudden surge in selling during the last hour, causing prices to plummet. The telegraphic transfer machine lagged behind the market by as much as ten minutes. This was due to concerns about a potential correction after the recent surge in market prices, and also due to the crisis in the French cabinet, which raised concerns about the devaluation of the French Franc. The market opened with soaring prices, with trading volume reaching 1.05 million shares in the first hour. In the afternoon, market sentiment began to waver, reaching a climax in the last hour. However, there was considerable resistance at the closing, and the trend turned again. Small exchange stocks slightly decreased, and the bond market was weak. The total trading volume for the day was 3.92 million shares. The Dow Jones New York indices are listed below:</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton – Actual Sales Become Stronger, Yarn Market Continues to Advance</h3>
<p>The yarn market is turning firm, and the situation is good. This is because outside investors are actively bullish on the price of marked yarn, and buying becomes stronger as the market dips. Moreover, the pulling power is particularly strong. In reality, yarn inventories are decreasing, raw cotton prices are high, and costs are increasing. The price ratio in the yarn market is still low for yarn prices, so the amount absorbed by the righteousness leader (yi tou) is never released. The demand for current yarn is progressing more rapidly, and the market situation in the afternoon is said to be even more advanced.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Further Rises by Ugly Yuan Marked yarn opened in the morning, with each month showing flat weakness and slightly falling by 0.3 or 0.4 jiao. However, after bidding on the second or third board, the rising trend slightly increased, because the securities group and outside investors came to drag in the market. Therefore, market sentiment suddenly firmed. By the time of closing, the buying sentiment was particularly strong. As a result, each month rose by 0.8 jiao to 1.46 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, but this month only rose by 0.2 jiao. The market continued to move forward after opening in the afternoon, and the table surface became more upright. It was also heard that current yarn sales were developing well, the Yunnan group's intake was particularly strong, resulting in an even stronger competitive state. The buying sentiment revived, but some colleagues tended to short. As a result, each month rose by 0.9 jiao to 2.2 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Dafeng sold 750 bales, Dafu 650 bales, Daji 1,450 bales, Gengfeng 1,050 bales, Changyu 850 bales, Shenji 550 bales, Renfeng 6 bales, Zengda 750 bales, Yichang 1,200 bales, and Changfeng 1,000 bales. Buyers included Yuda 700 bales, Jinchang 1,650 bales, Yuanyi 400 bales, Dachangcheng 550 bales, Yichang 1,200 bales, Mingde 700 bales, Shenji 750 bales, Runkang 1,700 bales, and Tonghe 1,300 bales.

<h3>Foreign Merchants Receiving Goods - Marked Cotton Falls Before Turning Back Up</h3>
<p>The cotton market remains strong. This is because general speculators are enthusiastic, and insist on buying, leading to a gradual exhaustion of chips in the market. Although Dongmian and some cotton merchants have released a large amount, outside investors continue to absorb it, showing a firm determination to be bullish. This month, American Foreign Company is greatly receiving goods, and market prices are even stronger, it is said.</p>
<p>Indian Merchants Buying Cotton</p>
<p>The market opened in the morning. Because there were 60,000 dan of delivery chips in the current month, most people were bearish. The opening situation of the first board was quite weak, breaking down and falling to 0.2 or 0.3 jiao. Distant months broke into the 4 yuan mark. By the third closing board, Tongfeng was entrusted by Indian merchants to buy in large quantities, the table wind turned and each month jumped 0.3 or 0.4 jiao. By the closing, it was even stronger. As a result, each month rose by 0.3 jiao to 0.25 jiao compared to the closing price of the previous day, but the near month fell by 0.15 jiao. After opening in the afternoon, it fell slightly, but after the second and third bids, it moved forward step by step. This is because the current yarn sales trend is smooth, and people's hearts are getting better and better. However, the general industry's intention to change course. As a result, the closing price compared to the morning, each month rose by 0.1 jiao to 0.55 jiao. It was found that Yuanda sold 1,500 dan, Hexing 1,200 dan, Dafu 1,600 dan, Dafeng 2,600 dan, Daji 1,900 dan, Shenchang 1,400 dan, Dachangcheng 4,600 dan, Runkang 1,300 dan, Shengyuan 2,600 dan, Xincheng 4,200 dan, Yuanxingchang 1,800 dan, Yichang 3,100 dan, and Changfeng 1,700 dan.

<h3>US Cotton Dumping Increases and Falls Back</h3>
<p>—Indian Cotton Still Firm with People Receiving—</p>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened with each month rising and falling by two pounds. Subsequently, due to the increase in sellers of the December contract, the Texas low-grade cotton base softened, and the stock market was weak. The bulls settled, and people dumped the March and May contracts, causing the price to fall. Hedging activities suggested that the dumping of the March and May contracts was being done by cotton storage places, and industry peers continued to absorb them. Brokers and foreign merchants bought the distant months, so the difference between the months was closer. After a new round of buying by outsiders, the market situation turned quiet. Hester estimated that the factory use this week would be 316,000 bales, and the Liverpool inventory would be 24,000 bales. Near the closing, peers bought in and short positions were covered again. As a result, spot fell by 15 pounds, and futures fell by 7 to 16 pounds. British cotton spot remained unchanged, and futures fell by four points. The amount of profit-taking by Indian cotton bulls was absorbed by short covering and futures traders. It is estimated that Pingguoer rose by 1.5 rupees, Aomula rose by 3 rupees, and Bailuoxi rose by 3.5 rupees. The original telegram record is left. (Dispatch from the 22nd)</p>

<p>Grains - Distant Term Flour Absorbed by Retail Investors</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the flour market opened with a stable near-term and flat distant-term trend. Imported wheat was quoted at about 12 jiao lower in Chicago and 8 fen in Canada. Because this month is close to delivery, there were slight transactions by the Beilu guest group, and the market appeared to be firm. Distant-term trading was not smooth because most industry insiders and outsiders were waiting and watching. Therefore, although it was slightly better at first, profit-taking bulls then settled, and it turned flat again. In the afternoon, there were not many transactions this month, and prices were stable. Because the factory did not dump the distant term, speculators successively absorbed more than 100,000 bags, and there were not many chips on the table. After this activity, the price rose again, about 1 point better than the previous day's closing price.</p>

<h3>Wheat Futures Retract by Four or Five Points</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the wheat futures market opened with an exceptionally quiet atmosphere. Only the November and December contracts opened at a price, and the rest were all empty bids. The price was slightly lower by one or two points. In the afternoon, the market remained weak. Because the delivery of the current month is approaching, and the current wheat has opened to five yuan, a few have withdrawn to match the current prices. Because there are very few new buyers in the distant term, the old bulls have slightly released their positions, so they are slightly lower by two or three points. In the future, the chips will become rarer and rarer, and there will be little honor or disgrace to speak of. The current wheat market is that high-quality goods have been raised by 0.3 to 0.5 points, and the medium-quality and inferior-quality goods are as usual. Because factories reject each other, the high-quality goods are priced at five yuan as a big barrier, and it will not be breached for a while. The price of Shandong Guantian Shaheji wheat is five yuan, Yaowan wheat is four yuan and nine jiao and eight fen, inferior quality is eight jiao eight, Shaoxing wheat is four yuan and eight jiao and two fen, Jiangbei wheat is four yuan and nine jiao and eight fen, and Hankou wheat is four yuan and nine jiao and three fen. Fuxin handled 4,000 bags, and Xinda handled 1,000 bags.</p>

<p>Wheat Bran Yelling Price Loosens</p>
<p>The wheat bran market gradually rose with the Customs Gold and flour prices. Fuxin bran once yelled at 3 yuan and 1 jiao and a half the day before yesterday, and scattered brand bran yelled at 3 yuan and 5 fen. Yesterday, the market transaction was not smooth, and there were few foreign villages and inland gangs going to the stomach, and the price loosened slightly. It is estimated that Fuxin bran opened at 3 yuan and 1 jiao, and scattered brand bran yelled at 3 yuan and 12 fen.</p>
<h3>Guest Xiang Rice Stockpiling Revives</h3>
<p>Yesterday, guest xiang rice arrivals were still strong, and the market was in good shape due to the revival of stockpiling households, and the price rose again by about 1 jiao. According to recent arrivals, Gan rice and Wen-Tai arrivals were relatively strong, and there are realizations for each road that have been successively submitted. The market originally expected small volumes, but yesterday it was rumored on the market that there was another reform of the legal currency, so the stockpiling households inside and outside the industry were scrambling to absorb them. In the morning, 4,000 or 5,000 bags were handled, and the appetite was still greedy in the afternoon. A total of about 8,000 bags were handled, while the actual sales in this street were only more than 2,000 bags. The stockpiling households still have strong intentions, and they may have to increase prices in the next two days. If the rumor is disproved and subsides, the market price will still be difficult to increase firmly. The whole day opened with 6,000 bags of Wen-Tai rice, 4,285 bags of Gan rice, 740 bags of Xiang-Shao-Min-Zhang various rices. Foreign rice stockpiling households firmly defended and only opened 200 bags of Saigon rice.</p>
<h3>River Lower Rice Arrival Weakness Improves</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, the sources for each gang were slightly scarce compared to before, with a total of nearly 40 numbers (about 8,000 stones of goods). Due to the cloudy weather, people's hearts were facing up, and each goods rose successively. If Hou Zao and other japonica prices, high-quality goods recovered by about 1 jiao, and the mid-market improved by a few points. The Ke-Bang rice was quite thick, and continued to handle 3,000 or 4,000 bags. Therefore, the resellers tightened, and the market only improved by a jiao or so. Du Yangjian was already firm, but yesterday it also added 1 jiao, and the Yuan Ding bureau changed.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, the sources of each road in the lower river was forty-two or three numbers, and each goods was going on the market. White japonica early, thin rice, Yang Shi, Bu Jian, and retail turned active. Then the white japonica rose high and tightened by several points, and the early thin rose one or two jiao. Yang Bu Jian tightened by a few points, and the white Yuan retail was still stagnant, and the price was weak by a jiao or so, Ke Jian</p>
<h3>Bran Tax Has Not Yet Been Clearly Exempted Yellow Soybean Market is Severely Hit</h3>
<p>The yellow soybean market has been hit hard because the sales of soybean cakes are still sluggish, causing factories to be unwilling to purchase vigorously. In general, the factory is obstructed by the additional tax on bran in Guangdong Province. Although the factory has been persuaded to resume work, shipping merchants are reluctant to take risks lightly because there is no clear order for exemption. Fortunately, the trade is still acceptable, and the shippers are still firm in their desire to sell, so the general trend is stable. Yesterday, 3,400 or 500 bags of various beans were opened, 7 vehicles were taken away by the factories, and the rest were taken away by the Nanyang Gang of this street.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Silk Transactions are Quiet</h3>
<p>Recently, the overseas silk market has been silent, and there is a lack of domestic raw materials. Silk factories have closed one after another (it is estimated that more than 10 factories have closed, accounting for more than one-half), and the market price in Shanghai is gradually falling due to the quiet transactions. Looking at the future of the silk industry, it seems that it will enter a quiet state again.</p>
<h3>Moroccan Green Tea Reportedly Declining</h3>
<p>According to Moroccan news, the green tea market there has been stable in recent months. Now, due to the large increase in the import of Chinese Zhenmei needle eyebrows and other goods, the bottom on the market has accumulated to more than 80,000 boxes, and the price has fallen again. The average price of Chinese Gaozhuang Zhenmei pearl tea has fallen by 30 francs per load, and the two items of needle eyebrows and show eyebrows have been reduced by more than 10 francs. However, Japanese Zhenmei is reduced by more than 50 francs per load because its sales are not as good as Chinese tea.</p>

<h3>How to Help Children in Disaster Areas?</h3>
<p>— Bo Guang</p>
<p>This year, the flood-stricken areas in our country span several provinces. It is truly unfortunate that the general public has suffered such a major hardship! Time flies quickly, and it is now the beginning of winter. How distressed are the disaster victims who are homeless and have nothing to eat, crying out in hunger and cold? Especially those innocent and naive children.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, our Sian district held a children's speech contest. The topic was "How to Help Children in Disaster Areas?" The children all had very good ideas. Summarizing them, there are mainly two points, which are written below, hoping that children all over the country will implement them.</p>
<p>First point: Saving candy money to help disaster relief is the best idea, because it is best for children not to eat anything other than three meals a day. Eating too much candy is easy to damage teeth and hinder digestion. Saving this money to help children in disaster areas is truly beneficial to others and oneself.</p>
<p>Second point: Soliciting cotton clothes from parents and relatives. The weather is getting colder day by day, and warm clothes are essential for them. It is very difficult for a person to suffer from the cold. Soliciting cotton clothes from parents and relatives is the most effective work and must be implemented quickly!</p>
<h3>Quezon, the First President of the Philippines</h3>
<p>— Jian Ying</p>
<p>Children, the Philippines officially declared its independence on November 15th this year and established a self-governing government. Who is the first president of this self-governing government? It is Manuel Quezon, the former Speaker of the Philippine Senate who once visited our Shanghai.</p>
<p>Manuel Quezon is fifty-eight years old this year. In 1898, he was a young junior officer under Aguinaldo. At that time, the people of the Philippines were under Spanish rule and launched a great revolutionary war. He tried his best to defeat the Spanish troops in the war. Later, the rule of the Philippines unfortunately fell into the hands of American imperialism, and it did not officially become independent. He was depressed and lived quietly in his own home. It wasn't until the beginning of the 20th century that his classmate Sergio Osmeña founded a daily newspaper advocating independence. He came out again to assist Osmeña in running the newspaper. Later, in 1906, he and Osmeña cooperated to form the "Immediate Independence Party." The following year, the "Immediate Independence Party" merged with the "United Nationalist Party" and was renamed the "Philippine Nationalist Party." Osmeña became the leader of the party, while Quezon was frustrated and unwilling. Later, this "Nationalist Party" became the largest political party in the Philippines. Osmeña also became the Speaker of the Philippine Parliament and held the position for more than ten years.</p>
<p>In 1912, Quezon was appointed by the parliament as a commissioner to the United States, where he actively campaigned for the independence movement. Finally, he obtained the approval of the United States Congress, allowing the Philippines to officially become independent and establish a self-governing government after ten years. This success suddenly raised Quezon's status in the Philippines. Until he defeated their party leader Osmeña.</p>
<p>In November 1916, Quezon resigned from his position as representative to the United States and became the President of the Philippine Senate. He and Osmeña then split into two factions: the Independent Democratic Party, led by Osmeña, and the National Democratic Party, led by Quezon himself.</p>
<p>In September of this year, the Philippines officially held presidential elections. Because the old revolutionary Aguinaldo also came out to run, Quezon, fearing defeat, joined forces with Osmeña to increase his strength. As a result, he was surprisingly elected as the first president. Osmeña was also elected as the first vice president.</p>
<p>Now, the Philippine self-governing government has been officially established, and the United States has sent the vice president and the Secretary of War to participate. Since November 15th of this year, Quezon has begun his presidential life. The Malacañang Palace, where the governor used to live, has now changed its master to Quezon, just like Roosevelt is the master of the White House in the United States.</p>

<h3>Dust</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Min'er's heart has recently been filled with pleasant feelings, because what he hoped for has all been realized. Things like fountain pens and books, and recently his father gave him a bicycle, which made him feel an indescribable joy, because he had been thinking about it for many days.</p>
<p>After his father gave him this bicycle, he was very careful with it, constantly checking to see if his younger siblings were playing with it. He often took a soft cloth and gently wiped it, fearing it would rust.</p>
<p>Every morning, as soon as he got up, he would look at his beloved thing—the bicycle—only to find that there was a lot of dust on it, so he quickly wiped it off. He thought to himself:</p>
<p>"Hateful dust, why do you always have to make the things I like dirty? Where does it come from?"</p>
<p>"Brother, dust is very annoying. Where does it come from?"</p>
<p>"In bustling cities and industrial areas, it goes without saying that it comes from chimneys, but in sparsely populated suburbs, where does the dust come from? We naturally assume that it is brought by the wind from the city. This statement is not wrong, but its fundamental source is not like this. We must know that in addition to chimneys, volcanoes also erupt dust, and stones eroded by air and rain also produce dust. And the main base for producing dust is actually meteorites, which is what we call 'star debris.' We shouldn't hate dust, it also has its uses."</p>
<p>"How are meteorites the main base for producing dust? What use does it have?"</p>
<p>"Astronomers tell us that countless meteorites fly towards the Earth every day and burn up due to friction with the atmosphere. Therefore, the amount of dust produced by meteorites burning in the atmosphere must be considerable. You know that raindrops falling from the sky contain dust. If there were no dust in the sky, imagine where you would get droplets of rain, it would definitely fall down in a whole lump. At that time, all living things on Earth would suffer a lot of harm."</p>
<p>"What is the total amount of dust in the air?"</p>
<p>"That's too vague. But I have seen a small statistic: At the beginning of this century, a hurricane occurred in North Africa. It is said that more than one million tons of dust were blown to Europe, spreading throughout Europe. Some can fly down two thousand five hundred miles. There are also flights falling on the coast of Africa, which according to recent calculations is about 150 million tons."</p>

<h3>A Record of Participating in the Boy Scout Fundraising</h3>
<p>— Fang Qi, Sixth Grade Student of Nanyang First Primary School</p>
<p>On the 9th and 10th of this month, we were instructed by the coach to go outside to raise funds for disaster victims. I was assigned as the squad leader, because the teachers always praised me for being brave and promising. Our squad had a total of six people, and we set off at seven o'clock in the morning. At first, we were all afraid of being embarrassed. After making several donations, we gradually became bolder and were no longer shy at all. When we met people, we always called them "Mr.," "Uncle," "Grandpa," or "Madam," like beggars begging for alms. If we didn't get a donation, we wouldn't let go.</p>
<p>We were very polite when we asked people for donations. We bowed first and then explained the situation in the disaster area and the reasons for the fundraising. The amount of money donated was up to the donor, and we did not force them.</p>
<p>As for the fundraising targets, pedestrians were the majority. We donated along the way in shops, alleys, residences, and theater entrances. Many people were very generous in donating, but we also encountered quite a few who were unwilling to donate. However, some people really couldn't afford to donate.</p>
<p>Our fundraising results were not bad, because we were too young, so we always suffered more losses and gained less!</p>
<p>For lunch, each person ate a bowl of noodles, probably because our mouths were a little dry and our legs were a little sore. We felt that the noodles were especially delicious when we ate them. These two days, when we returned to school, it was already late at night.</p>

<h3>Science Education II—Children's Science Museum</h3>
<p>Explanation</p>
<p>(1) The Mei brothers want to visit the Children's Science Museum, but they are not familiar with the route, so they first look at the city map.</p>
<p>(2) The brothers put on their Boy Scout uniforms and set off on their bicycles.</p>
<p>(3) After walking five li, they finally saw the words "Children's Science Museum" in the distance. They quickly got off their bicycles and saluted the national flag.</p>
<p>(4) The two carefully observe the specimen room.</p>
<p>(5) The director's science lecture, Mei Sheng even took shorthand notes of it.</p>
<h3>Regarding "Children's Science Lectures"</h3>
<p>— Lin Yin</p>
<p>I have been writing the "Children's Science Lectures" for this publication for more than a year. I am grateful for the care, encouragement, and undeserved praise from many readers. Also, from writing this article, many readers have written letters expressing their willingness to befriend me, such as Qian Zhuo, Hengjiu, Zongwen, Shijun... I am grateful on the one hand, but I feel ashamed on the other. Such shallow things are worth such attention from readers. At the same time, I have to work harder to repay the readers' kindness. Therefore, although I have stopped writing for nearly two months due to busy affairs, I am now taking on this task again from my busy schedule. And I want to discuss my future plans with the readers. In the past, the fifty or sixty science talks were almost entirely focused on natural aspects. At that time, I had two goals in writing, one was to cater to the seasons, and the other was to connect with the teaching materials in textbooks. But what about in the future? I will change another goal. I deeply feel that the country's disasters are becoming more serious day by day, and social work is becoming more and more tense. Mr. Sun Yat-sen said: "The affairs of the world should be jointly responsible by the people of the world!" Children are the responsible persons of the future society. At present, it is urgent to understand all social relations, so that they can gradually approach social activities and be trained into people with strong will and active experience in future society. Therefore, in addition to natural sciences, the content of children's science lectures should pay special attention to the inculcation of "social science" knowledge. Second, in terms of style, I will change the past mechanical presentation format and adopt lively descriptions and narratives, so that children will find it more interesting and the impression can be more profound.</p>
<p>As for the publication time of the manuscripts, people often ask to stipulate that they be published every week. This is only because of my busy affairs. Some manuscripts are too crowded, and it is impossible to decide. This is a last resort, but I will try my best to arrange it so that readers will not be too disappointed.</p>
<h3>Kaleidoscope of the World</h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>What is called "Kaleidoscope of the World"? It is to regard the entire world as a kaleidoscope. Children, if you look into this "kaleidoscope," you can see different patterns one after another - each country has its own special national flag, special terrain, special products, special customs, and special buildings. Look! Look! The kaleidoscope is changing patterns! — Look! A yellow-robed country.</p>
<p>(1) A Yellow-Robed Country — Siam</p>
<p>(1) Siam's national flag (2) Siam's elephant (3) Local terrain (4) Siam's women (5) House in the forest (6) Beautiful temple and palace (7) Siamese men</p>
<p>Yellow-Robed Country</p>
<p>Siam can be regarded as the most devout country in the world that believes in Buddhism. In this country, there is no citizen who does not believe in Buddhism. If a man has not been a monk, then he loses his qualifications to be a citizen. Even the king must be a monk for several years before he ascends the throne. There are more than 16,500 temples throughout the country, all of which are magnificent and majestic (Figure 6). Because of this custom of national belief in Buddhism, people call it the Yellow-Robed Country.</p>
<p>Its Location</p>
<p>Where is Siam located? It is located to the south of our country. You can take out a world map and see that in the middle of the Indochina Peninsula, there is a country that stretches a long, slender foot into the middle of the Gulf of Siam and the Gulf of Martaban. This is Siam. It borders French Indochina to the east; it is next to British Burma to the west; and the southern part borders British Malaya (Figure 3).</p>
<p>Elephants Instead of Cars</p>
<p>Siam's domestic animals include cattle, horses, and elephants. Its elephants are even more famous. These elephants were originally produced in the forest, running in groups. The Siamese have a way to capture them, tame them, and use them to move timber and cultivate land, which is very helpful (Figure 2).</p>
<p>Its National Flag</p>
<p>Siam's national flag: There is a red stripe at the top and bottom, and a wider blue stripe in the middle, embedded in two white stripes (Figure 1).</p>
<p>Its People</p>
<p>Siam has a total area of approximately 200,100 square miles and a population of 10.3 million. There are approximately 600,000 Chinese living there. In fact, two-thirds of the Siamese people can be said to be descendants of our Han ethnic group, but now that their international status has improved slightly, they are unwilling to admit that they are descendants of the Han nationality (Figures 4 and 7).</p>
<p>Its Products</p>
<p>Siam is located in the tropics, the weather is very hot, and the northwest territory is full of forests. The Siamese live in houses built in the jungle (Figure 6). The annual output of timber is 52,000 tons, and the annual output of rice is more than 1.3 million tons. Children, in recent years, my country's rural areas have gone bankrupt, and rice production is decreasing day by day. The rice we eat every day is sometimes bought from Siam with money!</p>
<h3>The Story of the White Mountain Crow (11)</h3>
<p>— Xi</p>
<p>I immediately sang loudly, and what made me most satisfied was that after Jacques Tugan listened, he neither ran away nor fell asleep. He fixed his eyes on me, nodded from time to time, expressing his admiration, and murmured as if he was praising me. But after a while, I saw that he was not listening to my singing, but dreaming about his own poem. I took the opportunity to take a breath, and he smiled, shook his head, and said to me happily, "I have found the rhythm of my poem! This is the six thousand seven hundred and fourteenth rhyme that I came up with from my own mind! They still dare to say that I am old and useless, where did that come from! I will read it to my friends and see what they say then!" As he said this, he fluttered his wings and flew away, and soon disappeared.</p>
<p>(V)</p>
<p>I was all alone and very disappointed. The only way was to use the time in the evening to try my best to spread my two wings and fly to Paris. But I was very unfortunate and didn't recognize the way. Because I had only been flying with the pigeon, I couldn't remember any of the roads I had passed. So I stopped flying forward, turned a corner to the left, and flew to the Baoyide area. The sky was already dark, and I had no choice but to find a place to stay overnight in the Mao Fangdun Forest.</p>
<p>When I reached the forest, they were all asleep. Those magpies and jays that everyone knows are the naughtiest things in the world, always making noise. In the low bushes, many sparrows were chirping and trampling on each other. By the water, two egrets stood solemnly, as if thinking about something, patiently waiting for their wives. Several large crows, half-awake and half-asleep, perched on the top of the tallest trees, murmuring their evening prayers. Under the trees, the loving tits were still chasing each other. At the same time, a woodpecker hurriedly pulled its family out from behind and pushed them into a tree hole. Teams of linnets flew back from the fields, dancing in the air like clouds of smoke, and flew to a bush, covering the whole body of the tree. Larks, nightingales, and orioles were scattered on the branches, like crystals on a candlestick. The surrounding voices were so noisy, calling out to each other: "Come, my wife! Come, my daughter—my beautiful woman, come to me—here, my dear!—my sweetheart, come here!—Good night, my love!—My friends, see you tomorrow!—My children, may you sleep peacefully!"</p>

<h3>Recent Improvement of the World Economy and Its Significance</h3>
<p>— Lin Qing</p>
<p>Generally speaking, although many political tensions and currency crises have occurred in the past few months, the world economy has still shown signs of improvement. Both production and trade, and the number of employed people, have increased somewhat compared to the spring of this year. For example, the world industrial index of the Berlin Institute for Economic Research (1928 equals 100, excluding seasonal changes) rose from 103.5 in March to 105.0 in June. Judging from partial data, a slight upward trend can also be seen in July and August.</p>
<p>In terms of individual countries, the United Kingdom shows a particularly good recovery. Originally, the British economy had fallen into a standstill in the summer of last year, and a new rise only began this spring. This rise has recently become more pronounced. However, the main pillar of this rise, like the initial rise that continued until last year, is construction activity, especially the vitality of residential building. In other countries belonging to the sterling bloc, the general rise in production activity has continued at its best. In the autonomous territories, the boom in residential building and industrial investment continues. The situation in the Scandinavian countries is not bad either; although there has been some stagnation in exports recently, production and employment have still increased. Of particular interest is Belgium, which devalued its currency by 28 percent at the end of March this year, and has also seen a significant improvement in its economy recently. Clearly, exports are playing a major role in its industrial manufactured goods, because the price of exported products must adapt to the currency devaluation. Although there has been no significant increase in quantity, the general improvement in price increases and profitability resulting from the currency devaluation has greatly stimulated the increase in production and employment. This situation has been strengthened and maintained by the government's labor grant policy. Italy has also shown an unusual increase in production in the past. At the beginning of this year, there was a struggle between conservatism and militarism within the government. After half a year, the latter won, plunging the Italian economy into a vortex of intense war preparation. The military industry is showing rapid development, with production increasing every month and prices rising daily. Germany's economic activity is also a manifestation of the military boom. In addition, countries such as Austria and Czechoslovakia have also shown significant increases in production.</p>
<p>In contrast to the situation in these countries with rising economies, the countries in the gold bloc in Western Europe are still in a continuous recession. As for the United States, if we only look at the first half of this year, it can be said to be a country in economic retreat. Compared with the strong economic rise in the winter of last year, the United States showed an "intermediate reaction" in the first half of this year, but because of the improvement in rural purchasing power and the gradual increase in investment activity, the current intermediate reaction is less severe than before; moreover, since July, a new and relatively strong upward movement has been unfolding.</p>
<p>Looking solely at world industrial production, it has also continued to rise in the first half of this year, although its pace is much slower than the recovery in the second half of last year. According to a survey by the Berlin Institute for Economic Research, if 1928 equals 100, the index in June last year was 91.8, and in December it reached 102.3. In contrast, the index in January of this year was 102.6, and in June it rose to 105.0. From this, the continued rise in world production this year and the speed of that rise can be clearly seen.</p>
<p>According to the League of Nations Monthly Bulletin, the recent production index of various countries in the world is as follows: (1928 equals 100)</p>
<p>1933 Average　　January 1935　　March　　May　　June</p>
<p>United States　　　　　71.2　　　　　82.0　　　　　79.3　　　　　76.6　　　　　77.0</p>
<p>United Kingdom　　　　104.7　　　　　111.1　　　　　(First Term)　　　　　——</p>
<p>Norway　　　　　　　　116.6　　　　　109.5　　　　　112.9　　　　　117.5　　　　　125.5</p>
<p>Sweden　　　　　　　　105.6　　　　　111.5　　　　　115.4　　　　　115.4　　　　　——</p>
<p>Canada　　　　　　　　79.5　　　　　83.0　　　　　79.2　　　　　88.6　　　　　84.6</p>
<p>Belgium　　　　　　　　70.8　　　　　68.1　　　　　67.6　　　　　73.7　　　　　——</p>
<p>France　　　　　　　　78.0　　　　　73.2　　　　　73.2　　　　　72.7　　　　　72.4</p>
<p>Netherlands　　　　　　71.6　　　　　70.9　　　　　69.0　　　　　0.9　　　　　——</p>
<p>Germany　　　　　　　　80.5　　　　　85.0　　　　　92.0　　　　　796.5　　　　　95.4</p>
<p>Italy　　　　　　　　　88.3　　　　　92.5　　　　　104.0　　　　　113.6　　　　　102.1</p>
<p>Poland　　　　　　　　　62.8　　　　　59.6　　　　　64.7　　　　　65.0　　　　　67.9</p>
<p>Austria　　　　　　　　74.0　　　　　77.4　　　　　74.9　　　　　79.1　　　　　——</p>
<p>Czech Republic　　　　　69.4　　　　　67.4　　　　　67.7　　　　　69.0　　　　　(April)</p>
<p>Chile　　　　　　　　　130.0　　　　　135.3　　　　　143.3　　　　　147.8　　　　　——</p>
<p>Japan　　　　　　　　　143.4　　　　　146.6　　　　　159.0　　　　　159.3　　　　　(April)</p>
<p>World　　　　　　　　　95.2　　　　　102.6　　　　　103.5　　　　　105.0　　　　　(April)</p>
<p>According to the above table, we can more concretely see the phenomenon of the recent rise in the production index of various countries in the world.</p>
<p>Noteworthy in the production activities of the first half of the year is that capital production began to show a significant increase. In the major countries with rising economies, compared with the increase in consumer production since the end of last year, a rapid upward movement in capital production can be seen. This undoubtedly shows the vitality of investment activity.</p>
<p>However, the occurrence and development of such a world economic recovery is not due to the natural development of the world economy. The main reasons are: first, the development of the military industry. Originally, the current situation of the military industry in various countries in the world cannot be known in detail, but the recent surprising development of the trade in weapons, ammunition, warships, and aircraft in various countries in the world is an obvious fact; this fact alone is enough to prove the phenomenon of the development of the world military industry at present. According to a survey by the Berlin Institute for Economic Research, world military spending increased from 15 billion to 17 billion marks to 24 billion to 31 billion marks from 1929 to 1935. Recently, the military expenditures and budgets of major powers have increased significantly, so the current world military spending should be above 31 billion. Such a large number certainly expresses the special development of the world military industry recently. At the same time, the recent special expansion of steel factories and the chemical industry in countries such as the United States can also be regarded as the development of the world military industry before the giant. The second is the good economy of the construction industry. This is because during the panic period, capital interest rates were low for a long time, the prices of building materials and wages were reduced a lot, and general industry could not accommodate a large amount of capital, so the construction industry developed temporarily. However, even under such conditions, the so-called construction industry was still developed with the help of the family in a planned way. The British government's efforts to assist the construction industry are a clear proof. At the same time, what is particularly noteworthy in the development of the construction industry is the construction of so-called public works such as underground projects, water conservancy projects, and transportation construction. The construction of such public works can be said to be the center of various countries' labor grant programs, and it plays a decisive role in all investment. Under such labor grant plans, the United States decided on a large plan of 4.8 billion US dollars in the first half of this year to build so-called public works, and new plans were established in the United Kingdom and Belgium, France started new projects, and Germany and Italy continued their past efforts. Third, the implementation of inflationary policies and economic nationalism by various countries in the world, in an effort to exploit labor, can be said to be one of the main reasons here. ——The above three are the main reasons for the current improvement in the world economy, the so-called economic recovery.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>However, the astonishing development of the military industry is a clear manifestation of the active preparation for war by the powers; the so-called development of public construction and the implementation of inflationary and economic nationalism policies are also deeply related to the preparation for war. Therefore, the recent so-called economic rise and economic improvement are actually abnormal and a symbol of the war crisis.</p>
<p>Book Review</p>
<h3>Introducing "The Masses' Life"</h3>
<p>— Le</p>
<p>—Edited by Tao Fen, published by Life Bookstore—</p>
<p>Today, a year after the magazine, as we stroll through the magazine market again, the desolate scene we see reflects the declining appetite of our readers. The appeal of a magazine is no longer in its content, but whether its cover has a semi-nude star, sensual thighs, or whether the text reveals the privacy of a certain woman. This degeneration of the reading world really makes people unable to think of the forever unawakened life of our fellow countrymen in the period of so-called national crisis.</p>
<p>At present, the number of national journals in our country is pitifully small compared with countries with higher cultural standards, but since our magazine market is full of such publications, we cannot help but dislike that there are too many of them. Now "The Masses' Life" has been launched again! Among the magazines that "dislike that there are too many," is it just adding to the number of "too many"? No, absolutely not. She does have a shared creative meaning.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, "The Masses' Life" is something that general readers like. Although it has only been published for one issue, I believe that among general reading materials, she does have her sharp fighting spirit. In particular, the just cry for "national liberation," which all publications have long been tired of talking about, dare not talk about, and cannot bear to talk about, is full of various parts of "The Masses' Life." This is our cry for survival today, and it is also the cry that the masses in the long-suffering environment urgently want to vent. This point can be said to be the success of "The Masses' Life."</p>
<p>Tao Fen concluded in the launch speech "Our Lighthouse": "Strive to realize national liberation, eliminate feudal remnants, and overcome individualism: these three major goals, ——our lighthouse in the vast ocean of angry waves and raging waves,——are the major missions that the masses of all China should strive for at present; we are willing to do our best to overcome all difficulties and promote the advancement of this great movement in terms of culture!" The instructions of these three major goals are a prescription obtained by diagnosing the current diseases of the Chinese nation. If "The Masses' Life" can not be subdued by the strong in the future, and focus on these three major goals to promote the magnificent movement of liberating the nation, it will be a major gain in this year's magazine market. As Mr. Jin Zhonghua said in "Talking about National Self-Confidence": "A nation should have a kind of self-confidence in its own survival and development. ...... The evasion and complacency of the general public are unavoidable. If the country does not resist foreign aggression and the safety of the people cannot be guaranteed, our entire nation is being divided and dismembered, so how can the so-called national self-confidence be encouraged? The slogans of "national rejuvenation" and "national liberation" have become paper articles because of this reason. However, fundamentally, national self-confidence is necessary; especially for our oppressed nation, if we want to survive and develop, we can only believe in our own strength." For the sake of preserving this "national self-confidence," we really cannot help but earnestly hope for the eternal life of "The Masses' Life"!</p>
<p>The contents of each article in this issue are generally very substantial, and what readers should pay attention to most is only the two articles "After the Monetary System Reform" and "Talking about Land Village Ownership." "Monetary System Reform" and "Land Village Ownership" are not only two major political events recently, but also issues that we often talk about recently. And Mr. Zhang Naiqi gave us an understanding of currency reform, and Zhifu gave us an analysis of land ownership, both of which have unique insights.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang told us that monetary system reform is limited currency expansion. Its effect can stimulate purchasing power, but it cannot generate purchases; it can stimulate prices, but it cannot stabilize prices. Therefore, he evaluates currency reform as follows:</p>
<p>"...They reverse the cause and effect, lightly pushing all the evils of panic onto the currency, and advocate that as long as the currency is expanded and the currency is devalued, the panic can be fundamentally eliminated. In China, they raised the silver issue higher than the sky, thinking that all the joys, anger, sorrow, and happiness are silver's tricks; and put aside the more fundamental semi-colonial form, the entire imperialist forces, the more serious imperialist military aggression, and all kinds of domestic feudal forces rampage."</p>
<p>His central gist is:</p>
<p>"Before the Chinese nation has obtained liberation, all prosperity is false——this is a trick of a small number of imperialist agents bragging about their wealth and glory in the midst of the masses' hunger and cold! And the acquisition of Chinese national liberation will never rely on a small number of people playing tricks, dropping gun flowers, blinking their eyes, and the old hen will become a ; it requires the masses to seize it in arduous and difficult struggles."</p>
<p>This makes us fully realize that in the state of sub-colonization, it is an impossible dream to unify the monetary system.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhifu told us that the claim about land village ownership is just a smokescreen used by the big landlords themselves who have seen the seriousness of the land problem: because if the land village ownership method is implemented, "the land is owned by the village, and the village offices that manage the land are the same as the current ones, and the village offices that are responsible for collecting various taxes are also the same as the current ones. The current village offices in Shanxi are the same as those in other provinces, and are the offices of landlords, rich peasants, and gentry." The result is that "the peasants paid the money, but did not get the land, and the landlords and gentry got the money (recovered the debt), and the fields are still in their hands." Therefore, land village ownership is by no means state-owned, and the land village ownership method is just "making a more powerful preservation for feudal remnants." To truly solve the land problem, there is a clear road ahead. We know that "behind the dregs of Chinese feudalism, there is imperialism backing it up," therefore, "the thorough solution of the Chinese land problem also means destroying the forces of imperialism in China at the same time. Solving the land problem and striving for national liberation are two inseparable basic tasks of the Chinese reform movement."</p>
<p>This view is very correct.</p>
<p>"The Masses' Life" is indeed a readable publication at present, and I dare to sincerely recommend it to you.</p>

<h3>Female Shop Owner</h3>
<p>— Talk by Ms. Zhang Lili</p>
<p>I am from Kunshan, and I grew up in Peiping. The year I was born was the second year that my father opened a woodenware store in Peiping. At that time, his store was very prosperous, and the family environment I encountered was of course very harmonious and pleasant. However, he rigidly adhered to the teaching that "a woman without talent is more virtuous," and did not allow me to go to school until I was nine years old. Later, fortunately, there were a few girls a few years older than me living next door who were studying. When they had nothing to do, they would "wholesale" what they had learned from the "teacher" to me, and from then on, it was like building a , and I had a good foundation in academics. By the time I was twelve years old, I could almost recite the textbooks for the first or second grade of elementary school; my father saw that I was so eager to learn, so he no longer insisted on his prejudices and sent me to school.</p>
<p>After graduating from middle school, my father's strength did not allow me to want to continue my studies. At the same time, Mu occupied the position due to the influence of the current situation. Over time, I couldn't maintain it. The persecution of life forced me to step into society to swindle a bowl of rice to reduce the burden on my family, so I left Peiping and went to Tianjin.</p>
<p>After arriving in Tianjin, one day, I saw a very small advertisement in the newspaper for recruiting film actors. The age and qualifications specified above were all in line with me; to me, who had been in Tianjin for a week, this was naturally nothing short of a piece of good news from heaven.</p>
<p>I came out of my residence and hurriedly hired a car to pull to that company. Half an hour later, I could already see the company's door, which was covered with a notice-like announcement, and the dark crowd formed a circle. It was really thanks to the beautiful clothes I was wearing that day that I was able to open a "way to survive" in the midst of so many people and cross the threshold of that company; because when I struggled forward, the general crowd of applicants turned their heads and glanced at me and automatically stepped aside. They probably all misunderstood that I was a "star" or something in this company, so they were all willing to be so "courteous."</p>
<p>I walked to the registration office, and as usual, I paid a fee of one yuan and a half-length and full-length small photo each; at that time, several young men in suits came to greet me, took the money and small photos, and at the same time, very politely said to me: "Please don't leave, you can take the exam in a while."</p>
<p>"Just slightly zero, that's it!"</p>
<p>"Didn't your recruitment advertisement say that you would look at the small photos first and then come to test the camera after three days?" I asked them in surprise, and I didn't think they had any other role at the time.</p>
<p>"Yes, that's what the advertisement said, but sometimes it depends on the person! You wait a while, and you'll be right!" Several people smiled.</p>
<p>In order to urgently need to solve the life, I had to accept their kindness and sit there; but in that short time, I saw several people who came in to register, and they all left under their cold treatment, so a suspicion in my heart grew even bigger.</p>
<p>"These male actors are not needed by the company at the moment, so they are not tested today." One of them seemed to see my suspicious look, so he came over and explained it to me.</p>
<p>"If you don't need male actors, why does the advertisement say that you are recruiting 'male' and female actors?"</p>
<p>"If you only recruit female actors, you're afraid of being talked about!" He said, stammering, and smiled.</p>
<p>More than half an hour passed before a small clerk-like person came out and led me to a not-so-large glass shed, where several middle-aged men and women were already standing, laughing at each other. When they saw me coming in, they forced themselves to restrain their smiles and stared at me intently.</p>
<p>Among those who were making people, the first one to come over was probably a "director." He took my photo from the small clerk and looked at it, and then looked at me all over, and seemed very satisfied. He put his hands on his chest and asked my name, age, and place of origin in a serious manner. When I said that I was from Kunshan, a surprised and delighted look appeared on his face as he looked at me.</p>

<h3>On Wine</h3>
<p>— Bu Yi</p>
<p>Chemists consider wine a beverage with narcotic properties, while men of letters often regard it as a refined and elegant delight. Thus, men of letters have a special affinity for wine. Du Fu wrote in his poem: "Li Bai can write a hundred poems with a斗 of wine, sleeps in a wineshop on the streets of Chang'an, and when the Emperor calls, he refuses to board the ship, proclaiming himself a wine immortal." This wine immortal is the most famous drunkard in literary history. Liu Ling penned "Ode to the Virtue of Wine," and Xin Qiji also composed a ci poem while brandishing a wine cup. Among modern people, figures like Lu Xun and Yu Dafu were also great drinkers. Reading Yu Dafu's recent diary, one learns that while residing in Hangzhou, he would almost every night indulge in heavy drinking on the lake, and when the mood struck, he would inevitably compose new verses. As for Lu Xun, some ridiculed him as having "blurred eyes from drunkenness," and some even created a cartoon of him with a cup in hand, suggesting that he must have had a profound understanding of the mellow wines of his hometown.</p>
<p>It is said that in the United States, the crime rate increases significantly every year when grapes ripen, demonstrating the detrimental effects of wine. Therefore, their patriotic citizens even enshrined prohibition laws in their esteemed legal code. However, a fondness for wine seems to be inherent in human nature, both in the East and West. The fervor of Americans for their "cup of cheer" is no less than that of us descendants of the Yellow Emperor. However, in recent years, this land of gold has also been struck by the evil tide of economic panic. Since President Roosevelt entered the White House, in order to revive the market, he repealed the prohibition laws. It is said that on the first night of the initial lifting of the ban, those long-restrained drinkers all indulged in unrestrained drinking throughout the night. One wonders if the "October Wine Market" recorded in the "Ancient and Modern Records of Chengdu" also reflected the scene of the initial lifting of the wine ban in America?</p>
<p>According to sociologists, alcoholism not only increases the crime rate but is also one of the causes of poverty. Elwood is one such proponent of this view. He said: "An investigation of those aided by various charitable organizations reveals that nearly a quarter of them are due to alcoholism." The American Fifty Investigating Committee investigated in thirty-three major cities and found that out of more than 30,000 foster care cases, 18.46% were due to the individual's alcoholism, and 9.36% were harmed by the alcoholism of others. Therefore, the total number of impoverished due to alcoholism is 27.82%. The investigation of the situation in other American cities is similar. The percentage of those impoverished due to alcoholism is even higher in British cities than in America. According to a survey by the Massachusetts Industrial and Patrol Bureau, 39% of the poor are directly or indirectly due to alcoholism. It is no wonder that the wine-loving Xin Qiji wanted to reject the wine cup and that Cao Mengde said that wine could lead to the downfall of a nation.</p>
<p>My "friend," Ping Yu, is a wine lover. Although he is not addicted to old wine, he has a large collection of fine wines at home, and his deep fondness for it cannot be replaced by anything else. He often invites a few close friends to his studio to drink heartily all day long. During winter and summer vacations, I often visit his studio for a good drink when I have time to return home. Recently, Ping Yu inscribed the name of his study as "Bitter Wine Hermitage," presumably imitating the "Bitter Rain Studio" of the elder Zhitang. However, to insist on calling wine "bitter" must reflect a deeply felt sentiment.</p>
<p>Living in this chaotic world, intellectuals who are filled with passionate sorrow are not allowed to speak their minds because of the environment, and they lack the strength to break through the suffocating atmosphere. Therefore, those who take a shortcut throw themselves into the embrace of "Du Kang" (wine). "Drink more wine, speak less," is taken as the golden rule. Anesthetize oneself, forget one's worries, entrust profound pain to tranquility, and preserve one's whole life in this chaotic world. Therefore, wine has become a symbol of the end of the century. The decadent atmosphere of the Wei and Jin dynasties can be seen again today, which has its historical reasons.</p>
<p>Wine country has unexpectedly become a winding path of escape from the world. But even though Li Taibai was madly infatuated, he had the courage to offend Gao Lishi, whom people did not dare to offend, when he was drunk. Even though he was surviving in a decadent era, he still had the courage to play the game of catching the moon after being thoroughly drunk, to sacrifice himself for his romantic interests. Can you say that he completely buried his spirit in fine wine? Can you say that there was no hatred in his drunken eyes? Can you say that he really drifted through life without anything worthy of his sacrifice?</p>
<p>Therefore, I feel sorry for the general drinkers of today!</p>
<p>"Facing the wine, one should sing; how short is life?" It is a pity that such a tragic and inspiring song has not been heard for a long time.</p>

<p>said, "How can someone from Kunshan speak such good Beijing dialect? Haha..."</p>
<p>"I grew up in Beijing!"</p>
<p>"Ah! No wonder you look like a Beijinger. - Do you like making movies? - Can you swim? - How about riding horses? - Ah, you can? Can you drive a car? - Haha! You can a little? That's not bad! Okay, now let's try you out on camera!"</p>
<p>He asked a long string of questions, and I just nodded at him. At that time, I was like a monkey, and I did whatever he directed. He made me do all sorts of poses in front of the camera: frontal, profile, sitting, lying down, back view, as if I were a "model" in a painting, except there was no nudity.</p>
<p>After that "exam," they considered me satisfactory and accepted me. The monthly salary was only over twenty yuan, and I had to solve the problem of food and lodging myself. The first film to be shot, "Dangerous Marriage," was decided to be starred by me. Because the company's capital was limited, crude and shoddy production was their production policy. As a result, the actors were the ones who suffered. Taking a monthly salary of more than twenty yuan, one had to film day and night. Whether your energy was up to it or not, they didn't care. They just wanted you to come to the set every day to play a role. Regarding acting skills, the director may not have been as serious as he was on the day I auditioned at the company. This "Dangerous Marriage" took only five months, under the policy of exquisite and crude production. Later, it was said that the film made money, but I didn't want to stay there and indulge in the "movie star" dream anymore.</p>
<p>After leaving Tianjin, what allowed me to get a foothold was the current Shanghai. My relatives in Shanghai had heard a little about my movie life in Tianjin, so when I came to Shanghai this time, they all advised me to "repeat the old tune" and introduced me to work at the Lone Star Film Company. The scope here was indeed larger than that of the Tianjin company, and the production was also more serious. The first film I shot at Lone Star, "Flying Swallow," seemed to be slightly better than "Dangerous Marriage," so after "Flying Swallow" was completed, the company decided that "Flowery World" and "Female Detective" would also be starred by me. But soon, because of my marriage problem, I ran to Singapore in a hurry as if I was fleeing for my life. In the end, the leading roles in these two films had no fate with me!</p>
<p>My arrival in Singapore was due to a friend in Shanghai who had found a position for me, so as soon as I arrived, I had something to do. The organization I worked for was a foreign-run import and export trading company, run by a foreign boss. The business was very developed, especially the imports to China accounted for the majority. The company employed more than thirty Chinese, but I was the only woman. The monthly salary was about more than eighty yuan in national currency. My job was to be a clerk for a Chinese "comprador," which was very easy, but dealing with him all day long was more troublesome than working. I patiently worked there for half a year, but later I finally resigned because I couldn't "take it" anymore.</p>
<p>After returning to Beiping from Singapore, I entered the dance hall attached to the Central Hotel. The life of a dancer for half a year did indeed allow me to accumulate some money. So, as soon as Mr. Yuan Liang's ban was issued, I quickly "changed the strings and changed the pitch," stopped dancing, and took the initiative to create a wine bar similar in nature to dancing. I spent several thousand yuan in capital, and the location was near the former Dongdan Canteen. This wine bar opened not long ago. One reason was that female waitresses were still the first of their kind in Beiping, and the other reason was my own past "small reputation." Therefore, the general college students were all "thrilled," and the business grew day by day. My intention in using female waitresses in this wine bar was not ulterior. These women who served as waitresses were all students who had learned to dance from me in the past. Since the dance ban was issued, they had no livelihood, so I invited them to help me manage the business. However, the purpose of the general customers in coming here was different from my original intention. Their purpose in coming to this wine bar was nothing more than to enjoy the pleasure of "seeking pleasure," and although I was a hostess here, sometimes for the sake of business, I had to let them make rude jokes once in a while. Therefore, the daily income of this wine bar, when totaled up every night, was a large sum of several hundred yuan, not including the waitresses' "tips." As for my personal gain, it was that the reputation of "female owner" became more and more "pleasing to the ear," and the number of customers increased day by day.</p>
<p>The wine bar was closed in the winter of the twenty-second year. At that time, due to the influence of the current situation, Beiping was alarmed several times in one night. The general college students and dignitaries knew that their lives were important after all, and most of them left the "dangerous place" to find their paradise. The foundation of the wine bar was built on them, and at this point, it could not help but collapse. Not long after, I heard that Mrs. Tang Xiu, the wife of Mr. Shao Piaoping, who ran the Jingbao newspaper, was going to Shanghai. I hurriedly ran to find her and agreed to go south at the same time. When I arrived in Shanghai, I was introduced by her and entered the Dahua Dance Hall. The first contract was only for three months. Later, the boss, seeing that my "business" numbers were not bad, agreed to sign a long-term contract with me. From then on, all my actions were restricted by the contract, so when my father passed away this year, I could not return to Beiping, which was also due to the trouble caused by this contract! Although the income here is not bad compared to the Beiping era, the mental loss is more than compensated! Although I still cannot get rid of this profession, I believe that one day I will be able to say goodbye to it forever as I wish!</p>
<p>The last time I performed "The Merry Widow" at Jincheng was the first attempt to break away from the life of a dancer. Although the play was not well-received, considering that I only spent three days reading the script to achieve this bad result, I ask myself, or I may not be ashamed of the director?</p>

<h3>Enforced Marriage</h3>
<p>— Ma Kelun</p>
<p>Correspondent from Huangyuan, Qinghai</p>
<p>In this remote province of Qinghai, apart from Xining, the provincial capital, giving me a little initial feeling of capitalism, the rest of the rural towns can be said to have pulled me back to ancient society. Here, I saw commercial situations of bartering, nomadic life moving with the water and grass, barbaric marriage systems, ... . The inhabitants of this province include Mongols, Tibetans, Hui people, Han people, and also local people (said to be the Fengyang people brought by Zhao Chongguo when he fortified the border), each with their own different lives, habits, customs, and morals. If I were to record these in detail one by one, it might require a specialized book of millions of words. Now, I will just talk about the marriage situation of the Hui people as a story.</p>
<p>The Hui people mentioned here refer to the "Salar" (there are many types of Hui people), most of whom live by farming. They can be considered relatively enlightened among the local Hui people.</p>
<p>According to the general customs of the Hui people, daughters are not married to other ethnic groups. Originally, they valued and admired the Han people very much, but they were also unwilling to marry their daughters to them. This closed-door policy has naturally been in place for a long time and cannot be changed in a short time. At the same time, the occupations of the Han people are mostly business, which is constantly moving, whether in rural areas or cities. They are very afraid that their daughters will be taken to distant places, and there will be no chance to see them again. Because Hui customs originally value women over men, a good daughter in the family is cherished by the whole clan. If she is married to a Han person and taken elsewhere, it is as painful as losing a treasure! However, they are willing to marry Han women as daughters-in-law. One reason is that Han women are more beautiful, and the second is that after they are married into the family, they become the family's treasure and will not be lost again in the future. In this situation, the Han people seem to be in a lower position, but after all, the fact of intermarriage between the two ethnic groups is very rare.</p>
<p>The Hui people have always considered adultery to be a heinous crime, especially for married women, they are guarded even more strictly. If such activities are discovered, not only will the male and female protagonists be executed unconditionally, but the parents of both parties will also be subject to heavy punishment and humiliation. However, even so, the matter of illicit love is still inevitable, so such cruel acts are often seen or heard.</p>
<p>Major events of children's marriages are all completed through "the orders of parents and the words of matchmakers." Proposals for marriage are mostly initiated by the man's family. When their son is about to become an adult, they have probably already taken a fancy to a girl from a family that is "well-matched in social status." Therefore, they invite a matchmaker to go and propose marriage. This procedure is not troublesome. They only need to ask the matchmaker to bring the special gifts for proposing marriage (tea and wine, plus some sugar food and mutton), sit in a sedan chair, and go to the woman's house with great fanfare. After arriving there, they only need to state that they are entrusted by a certain family. There is no need to state the purpose of their visit, and the woman's family will understand. If the tea and wine have been accepted, it is an indication of permission for engagement; otherwise, the matchmaker will have to bring these two items back.</p>
<p>The auspicious date for the wedding is chosen by the "Ahong" invited by the woman's family (the so-called Ahong are people who make a living by chanting scriptures. They do not engage in production and specialize in doing weddings and funerals for others, and the gifts they receive are used to maintain their lives). On the morning of the wedding, the male family's relatives and friends, or by car or on horseback, set off for the woman's house, surrounding the groom, happily and cheerfully, and the air becomes very lively. After entering the door and eating breakfast (a cup of milk tea and a handful of umbrella-shaped noodles), the woman's relatives and friends invite the group to their home for lunch. In this way, you invite them over, and they invite you back. On this day, the groom and his relatives and friends have to eat the food of several families. After inviting relatives and friends, they return to the woman's house. At this time, the Ahongs who chant the scriptures have already arrived. They sit in a row in the courtyard hall according to seniority (a big Ahong has many disciples). The groom then kneels sincerely in front of them, and all the Ahongs, big and small, raise their voices and chant the scriptures. The content of the scriptures is roughly to admonish men not to oppress their wives, otherwise they will be condemned by heaven. After the chanting stops, the woman's parents and relatives then press down on the groom in order, exerting as much pressure as possible. After the first one presses down, the second one comes, and so on, one after another, until the groom cannot struggle with all his strength. Many have their hands and feet or legs broken, becoming disabled for life! It is said that the meaning of this move is: after the daughter gets married, her body and actions will be subjected to the oppression and control of the man. The woman's family has no right to interfere, so they take advantage of the time when she is about to pass through the door to give the man a kind of threat, so that he will not dare to abuse the daughter in the future, and at the same time, it is considered to be a way for the woman's family to vent their anger! However, the man's family is also prepared in advance. The relatives who accompany the groom are generally responsible for protecting him. Whenever the Ahongs finish chanting the scriptures, there are several tall and strong people who resist the woman's oppressors on one side and protect the groom from breaking through the encirclement on the other. After escaping the danger zone, the groom shows his power, bravely straddles his carved saddle, and gallops back to his home with a whip. Therefore, according to general customs, the more the groom can withstand the pressure, or the more strength he has to resist, and the taller and stronger he is, the more beautiful and praised he is considered to be. If the groom is not good at resisting, and the man's bodyguards are not very effective, then the groom will suffer, because if he cannot escape the danger zone, he will have to endure more pressure. Sometimes, even if he is rescued, he will be snatched back by the woman's family. This happens again and again. As a result, the groom's clothes are either torn to pieces, or his body is injured. Such a wedding ceremony really makes people afraid to marry a wife!</p>
<p>At the same time, the woman's family not only uses such cruel methods on the groom, but also captures a few of his elders, paints some colors on their faces (mostly oil and charcoal ash), and leads them around the streets or villages for a week. The woman's relatives and friends follow behind, mocking as much as possible. Only after the parade is over can they be released. This move is considered to be a demonstration to the man's family, because after the daughter gets married, not only will she be subject to the control of her husband, but his parents and uncles will also be able to dispose of her at will. Therefore, the woman's family takes this opportunity to issue a warning, so as not to let them come to the daughter and act domineering!</p>
<p>At dusk, the woman's family wraps the daughter in a large red cloth and supports her onto the donkey sedan by her uncle or brother. General relatives and friends fill the ranks of those seeing her off, marching mightily all the way to the man's house. But as soon as they arrive at the courtyard gate (most do not have a courtyard gate, until the steps of the courtyard hall), the man's family has already gathered many strong men, guarding there, not allowing them to enter. Therefore, several strong men in the woman's family hold the bride and stride straight into the door, while the strong men of the man's family do not show weakness and throw the opposing family members and the bride outwards. In this way, one wants to enter the door, and the other does not allow them to enter, and you come and I live in a battle for a long time. The so-called bride is simply treated as an abandoned object. When the contention is fierce, the shouts on both sides shake the sky, as if thousands of troops are fighting in pairs. At the same time, the man's family has also prepared guns and knives. If the woman's family is very fierce, it is inevitable to wield guns and knives to threaten them, but sometimes accidents happen and several lives are lost (the guns are loaded with iron sand). Therefore, this mock wedding rejection turns out to be a phenomenon in which the two sides lose their harmony and really engage in armed conflict! According to the Hui people's own explanation: Rejecting the bride from entering the door can show their dignity; others send their daughters, but they do not want them. Second, it is to warn the bride in advance that when she enters the man's door, her behavior must be correct, otherwise she will be driven out!</p>
<p>In the end, the bride is still carried into the man's house by her family and placed on the kang (platform bed). At this time, the wet nurse or aunt who came with her unties the red cloth, takes off the clothes of her virginity, and then ties her hair into a bun and puts on women's clothes. After the decoration is completed, the groom comes in to drink a cup of milk tea with her, and then relatives and friends come to make a scene in the bridal chamber. Although the couple can complete the good deed this night, they have also suffered a lot of shock and grievance!</p>
<p>The next day, the bride gets dressed early in the morning, walks to the courtyard hall, faces the sky outside the door, and "chants words" very respectfully. This is considered to be an expression of repentance to heaven after becoming a woman. Then, the man's relatives and friends invite the woman's relatives and friends to lunch. According to the custom, this family invites them, and then that family invites them again. Thus, the wedding is completed!</p>

<h3>The Question of Literary "Permanent Value"</h3>
<p>— Lu Fei</p>
<p>Homer and Dante—their poems are very old, but people still read them today; Turgenev and Tolstoy's novels, though produced in 19th-century Russia, are still admired by people worldwide; Ibsen and Gogol, though long dead, their "Nora" and "The Government Inspector" are still performed on stage, and there is a large audience at the performances. Based on these facts, general absolutists say that literary works have unchanging value. In their view, a great literary work, regardless of time and place, has the same great value; it can stand the test of time and space, and its value is immortal; the meaning of generally calling a great work an "immortal work" is to indicate that the work has eternal and unchanging value. If you want to oppose this view, they will ask you to explain why a great classical work is still loved and praised even now and in the future.</p>
<p>It is true that great classical works are still read today. However, the social role and influence of a great work at the time of its creation and after its era has passed are probably different. Goethe's "The Sorrows of Young Werther," when it appeared, burned like a fierce wildfire in the hearts of young people in Germany and even Europe, causing them to frantically pursue and maintain it in all aspects. Among them, many young people even imitated Werther and committed suicide. The so-called "Werther fever" became a major manifestation of the spirit of the times at that time. Today, although many young people still read "The Sorrows of Young Werther," and they are also very moved when they read it, there is no "Werther fever" in our time. When "Hernani" was staged at the French Theater on the night of February 15, 1830, it caused fierce struggles in the theater. As a result, the new Romanticism triumphed over Classicism, opening up a new path for French and even European literature. However, even if "Hernani" continues to be staged everywhere now, it cannot open up a new path for the literature of our time. In addition, the poems of Homer and Dante, the novels of Turgenev and Tolstoy, and the dramas of Ibsen and Gogol, as mentioned above, although they are read by people at the time of their creation and now, the feelings generated by the people at the time of their creation and the people now are different, so their social roles and influences are also different at different times. If literature is a product of society and also reacts to society, then the value of literary works should be determined by the degree to which they correctly reflect the real society and the magnitude of their reaction to society. In this way, we can say that since the social role and influence of a great literary work at the time of its creation and after its era has passed are different, then the value of this work is also different at different times, although great works are read in every era and have their meaning.</p>
<p>We believe that literature is a reflection of life. Human beings live in a real society, and they must not only understand the real living environment, but also know the past life; they not only like literary works that reflect real life, but also pay attention to literary creations that reflect the past life; therefore, even old literary works are read today. Among them, those great classical works, needless to say, artistically reflect a certain objective truth of their era. For modern people, in order to understand the objective truth of the past, in order to learn from the art of the past to create the art of the present, it is certainly more necessary to read them. The meaning of so-called great classical works being read to this day lies in this. This principle can also be illustrated by the study of general philosophical works of the past by human beings. For example, the philosophy of Aristotle and Plato is still read and studied today, but we cannot say that the meaning and value of their philosophical works are the same in the twentieth century and in their time. Similarly, although Goethe's "The Sorrows of Young Werther" and Hugo's "Hernani" are still read today, we cannot say that their value is completely the same at the time of their creation and now. Of course, a great classical literary work may be more attractive and more "readable" than a great classical philosophical work, but this is because the characteristic of literature is to concretely express life with living images, and it appeals to people's emotions more; we cannot say that literature has eternal value just because good literary works can make people "read them over and over again" at any time. Moreover, to be honest, the so-called "read them over and over again" is also relative. Baudelaire's poems and Wilde's novels are certainly "readable" for those who lead a decadent and hedonistic life and have such thoughts, but they may not be so for those who live seriously. Although Zola and Flaubert's novels are "readable" for those who dare to approach real social life, French moralists want to prohibit families with girls from storing Zola's works. It can be seen from this that the meaning of saying that great classical works are "readable" is not absolute, and it is especially wrong to think that literature has permanent value based on this.</p>
<p>However, saying this is not to absolutize the problem from the other side, saying that great literary works only have great value at the time of their creation, and have no value once their era has passed: this is the saying of absolute relativists, which is as erroneous as the aforementioned absolutists. First of all, literature continues to develop. Without the literature of the past, there would be no later literature. Without the great value of the literature of the past, the great value of later literature would have no way to be produced. Therefore, if past literary works have any real value at the time of their creation, then they must also have a certain historical value in the historical development process of literature. In this sense, those great classical works that most correctly depict the life of the past era and the objective truth of the past era are certainly of greater value in the historical development process of literature. For example, Balzac's novels correctly and artistically express the French society of the "Restoration" and "July Monarchy" era. Fritsche said that his description of French society at that time was as precise as a certain great thinker's "precision in studying the essence of capitalism." Such great novel works not only have great significance and value at the time of their creation, but also have a great driving force for the advancement of the wheels of literary history. Therefore, their value in literary history is certainly very great. In this sense, we can say that Balzac and the great writers of his rank are "immortal works." Secondly, the so-called reality and history are not absolutely standing. On the contrary, history is the mother of reality, and reality is a link in history. Based on this reason, we can say that the current literature is produced from the past literature. If we do not closely follow the development stage of the past literature and move forward, and do not learn from the past literature to create the current literature, then we have no way to build the new literature of the present. Therefore, the great works of the past not only have a certain value at the time of their creation and in literary history, but also have a certain value at the present time. I recently discussed in a short article why we should re-criticize great classical works. There I said that because we want to scientifically evaluate the meaning and value of great classical works at the time of their creation, in literary history, and at the present time, we must carry out re-criticism of great classical works. Here I raise this question again, hoping that modern critics who evaluate great classical works will not only explain their meaning and value at the time of their creation, but must also show their meaning and value in literary history and at the present time, so that they can be said to have completed their task. Finally, since great literary works have a certain value in literary history and at the present time, then, although a great literary work does not have an eternally unchanging absolute value, in the above-mentioned sense, we should admit that its objective meaning and value are eternally existing.</p>
<p>To put it more simply: because literature develops and changes with the development and changes of society, and its meaning and value also differ with the development and changes of society, so we cannot say that the meaning and value of great works are the same in any time and space, and say that they have eternally unchanging value; and because great literary works each have a certain meaning and value at the time of their creation, in literary history, and at the present time, although they are different from each other, so in this relative sense, we also admit that the objective meaning and value of great literary works are eternally existing. ——This is our principled answer to the question of the permanent value of literary works.</p>

<h3>Ledger Book (4)</h3>
<p>— Pu Yu</p>
<p>When I arrived at Yuan Tai's distillery, I didn't state my purpose all the time. The kid Jiang Xiwu was also very good at reading my face and speaking accordingly. Father Li Er was a little surprised, but there was no trace of cunning on his honest face. He very politely ordered a table of dishes and also selected a bottle of high-quality "Chen Se" wine, appearing very respectful. During the meal, he talked about how business was getting worse day by day and that sometimes the wine transported to Shanghai wasn't even enough to cover the costs. I just responded with "yes, yes," while calculating ways to deal with it in my mind!</p>
<p>After the meal, he led us to a small room behind the accounting office. The opium lamp had already been prepared there. Just as I was about to perk myself up, I unceremoniously took a seat on the couch first. He quickly prepared the opium and asked if I was an expert. I said I only had a slight addiction. Actually, if I didn't smoke for three hours, I would start yawning and have a runny nose!</p>
<p>After smoking two puffs, I felt strength returning to my whole body. So, I stood up, stretched, and put on a helpless face:</p>
<p>"Ah! Mr. Li, I'm very sorry! I wouldn't dare to bother you without a good reason..." I glanced at his surprised and suspicious expression and went straight to the point. "The other day, you didn't buy all the tax certificates for your wine, did you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, the director told me not to buy them!" He stood up quickly from the couch, holding the opium pipe in his left hand and the cleaning needle in his right.</p>
<p>"But now there's trouble!"</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"Hmph! The provincial bureau has sent an official document, specifying that you've evaded taxes!" I saw his pale face suddenly turn green. The opium pipe and needle both fell to the ground. So, I emphasized my tone: "That official document is extremely strict, and our director has to respond within three days!"</p>
<p>"But..." He scratched his bald head, staring at me with sad eyes. "But... the responsibility lies with your bureau! I... if I didn't do that, you advised me..."</p>
<p>Damn it! This old guy isn't simple. He's actually blaming me. Originally, he had a black mark! This was clearly my trap. Just take the other day, for example. As soon as his wine came out of the cellar, he personally came to the bureau to buy the tax certificates. Seeing that he was honest, I quietly took him into my office. I used a combination of persuasion and intimidation to get him to pay 200 yuan less in taxes and not collect all the tax certificates. I also allowed him to sell his wine within the four counties under the jurisdiction of our bureau. He reluctantly agreed and told me to take responsibility. I patted my chest and said: I represent the tobacco and alcohol bureau. Who dares to make trouble! Think about it, why would I collect less money and not issue all the tax certificates? Because the tax certificates are issued by the provincial bureau, and for every one sold, the money has to be remitted back. Who would sincerely do this kind of temporary money-lending business? So, I didn't issue the tax certificates and got 400 yuan of net income from him. What does it matter to me if I collect 200 yuan less? But this old guy saw the advantage earlier. Of course, I have to take advantage of his vulnerability. Now he wants to shirk responsibility? That's impossible! If I can't handle him firmly, I don't want to cause trouble for myself. So, I adopted a condescending attitude, preparing to knock him down:</p>

<h3>Zhao Hua Company Benefits Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>Hu Zhipei and Shi Tian, the principals of Zhaohua Film Company in this city, seeing that the flood and water had devastated the city, and the people were displaced, felt ashamed to seek private gain, and did not coordinate assistance. Taking advantage of the release of their debut film "Remnants of Shanghai" in Suzhou, they especially led the company's six-year-old child star Yu Ni, and more than 30 male and female film, song, dance, drama, and music personnel to Suzhou to perform a newly compiled song and dance drama "Where to Reincarnate." They are willing to donate 5% of the ticket income to disaster relief. The company has faced many dangers and survived by the skin of their teeth, but they still dare not shirk responsibility. Only those who are hungry and thirsty themselves can feel the urgency of the people awaiting relief. This intention and heart are truly worthy of recognition and emulation.</p>
<h3>Kim Hye-soo's "Broken Winged Swallow" - Premieres Today at the Grand Theater</h3>
<h3>Silver Jottings</h3>
<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>At the Pan Hu wedding, the editor of "Art Sound," Chen Jiajia, was nowhere to be seen, which was very worrying.</p>
<p>It is rumored that Mr. Chen has been slightly ill recently. Judging from his absence from the Pan Hu wedding, this is not a rumor.</p>
<p>Most of the guests attended the ceremony as couples, while among the single guests, there were more women than men, which is difficult to understand.</p>
<p>Someone said: What's so hard to understand? Hu Die is married, "the beauty belongs to Shah Rukh Khan," would you ask Die's fans to watch someone else's "triumph"?</p>
<p>One of the bridesmaids, Ms. Gu Lanjun, kept laughing during the wedding march. Someone said: What's so funny about the mermaid? Is she happier than the bride?</p>
<p>Another bridesmaid, Yuan Meiyun, has also become a news figure recently. Breaking away from her adoptive father and being close to Wang Yin is a topic of conversation among people after dinner, no less than Hu Die's wedding. Someone said: I wonder what Yuan Meiyun was thinking when she slowly walked forward during the wedding march?</p>
<p>Chen Juanjuan, the "Lamb," was not seen among the flower girls.</p>
<h3>Oriental Theater News</h3>
<p>Due to the completeness of the curriculum and the seriousness of the training within the Oriental Theater Company, the members have made considerable progress in pronunciation and acting in the past two months. Currently, Ding Wanlai, Tian Jianshan, and others are responsible for rehearsing the three plays "School for Wives," "Ward No. 5," and "Money."</p>
<p>It is said that Ding Wanlai himself will play the male lead in "School for Wives" because it is necessary to ask an old general to play this special and typical old man.</p>
<p>Tai Hongyun, who is famous for playing "The Miser," is Ding Wanlai's best student.</p>
<p>"Ward No. 5" was written by Tian Han in the past for all the female members of the Southern National Society. Now, because the Oriental Theater Company has too many female members, they are using this script to give more than a dozen lively girls the opportunity to perform.</p>
<p>The play "Money" is performed entirely by male actors. It will be performed at the same time as "Ward No. 5" in the future, which is no different from a performance competition between the male and female members of the Oriental Theater Company.</p>
<p>"School for Wives" is currently being heavily rehearsed and will be performed soon. All costumes and stage decorations are being designed by Gai Xu, the company's stage manager.</p>
