<h3>斯特里薩會議後之歐注洲局勢</h3>
<p>— 恒</p>
<p>斯特里薩會議已於十四晨團會·興會之英法意三國所决議者。計有八點。（一）英法意三國重申對於洛迦諾條約所負之義務。（二）締結天空公約。德若參加。英法·法意·英意之間。或不致再訂兩邊條約。（三）預定五月間召開羅馬會議以期成立中歐公約。（四）為完成東歐之和平三國認為有繼續過去努力之必要。（五）中歐各國之重整軍備。應在區域安全之範圍內。由有關各國共同商定之。（六）希望德國重返國聯。（七）認和平之維持與軍備之限制。須得德國之合作。（八）聲明三國政策。在於國聯之機構內。共謀和平之維持。對於足以危害　洲和平之單方面的廢約行動。一致主張密切合作。予以切實制止。觀此八點。可知英法意三國對德之態度。以視二三月之前。尙無所變更。如中歐公約之締結。對德重整軍備之方針。皆與一月三日法意協定所議定者絕無不同。而（二）（三）（四）（六）（七）各點。皆為二月三日英法倫敦談話所議定之成規。除二三月來英法意所協定之各點外。斯特里薩會議更使三國對德之步驟趨於一致。英意重申對於洛迦諾條約所負之義務。蓋所以增加法國安全之保障。而三國政策協調之聲明。則表示三國對德陣綫之一致。故今次斯特里薩會議之結果。殊於法國有利也。</p>
<p>自來歐洲各國對德之政策。常由德國對外之態度而轉變。卽今次英法意三國對德政策之一致。與德國收回薩爾後所表露之態度。實亦不無關係。在法國方面。當初以為隡爾歸德之後。或能稍平德國之憤慨。因而可以重啟歐洲集體和平之門戶。孰知薩爾歸德之後。德方趾高氣揚。雄心越盛。一時輿論。多有主張以投票式解决奧國歸德問題者。同時對於東歐方面之士地發展。亦復不肯放鬆一步。因是旣使法意寢饋難安。復使蘇俄仇德益甚。德政府於英外相西門訪德之前。突然宣布徵兵制之恢復。擴充國防軍為三十六師。而於西門訪德之時。復向英要求四十萬噸之海軍。與英相等之空軍。至於中歐東歐各約。復以嚴峻之態度。予以拒絕。實亦足使英國不安。是以不獨法俄軍事同盟之醞釀。法意關係之加深。胥為希特勒此種雷厲風行之行動所召致。卽英國對法態度之和諧。要與德國此種態度不無相當之關係。意者。希特勒對於英國態度。認識或有不足　。英固不願法國獨霸歐陸。然又豈願德國獨在歐陸稱雄。以最近之情勢論。英國對於法德。其忌德之程度。或甚於忌法。亦未可知。蓋以一則法為比較愛好和平之國家。二則法國比較上非重工業之國家。貿易上非英之勁敵。三則法國於殖民地頗能自足。與英無甚衝突。四則德國國勢日振。法國防德猶感不暇。殊無加害於英之可能。反之德意志民族。戰鬥力甚强。歐戰時。德以一國之力。血戰英法意俄美等强國至四年之久。其後雖不免於戰敗。然而四年之間。始終以敵境為戰塲。已國境內。絕未受有兵燹之禍。其戰鬥力之强可以想見。加之德為重工業之國家。軍備之恢復。為事甚易。且人口多於法國。生殖率高於法國。故無論從何點而觀。德國戰鬥力之潛能。實遠在法國之上。故今日之英。殊無積極扶德抑法之必要。更使英國不安者。卽德國戰前之殖民地。大多在英之手。德欲恢復其戰前之地位。若僅僅擊敗一法國。殊無濟於事也。亦唯如是。故戈林將軍早有以空軍襲擊英國之計劃。更有聯絡愛爾蘭夾擊英國之深謀。英國所以首先發起天空公約者。卽探知德國有此項企圖之故。而去年包爾溫氏所以聲言英國之國防應在萊茵河岸者。亦由於此故今日之英。所疑忌者乃為德國。殊為顯然。希氏雖窺破英國保守黨政府對俄並無好感。欲以反俄之策略。求達其東向發展之雄心。而博英國對已之同情。殊不知今日之英國。有類豪富之家。以身家為重。頗欲維持和平之局。坐享安全之樂。其所以傾向法國安定歐局之計劃者。良以除維持現狀外。更無安定歐局更好之方法也。俄取和平政策。最近艾登居然聘俄。可知今日之英俄。亦無絕不相容之矛盾。故今次英法意三國在斯特里薩會議中態度之一致。實非偶然。</p>
<p>德國於此局面之下。自唯有二路可走。（一）卽始終不顧其自身之陷於孤立。拒絕參加三國會議所定之集體和平運動。（二）卽接受此種和平辦法。自動參加各種公約之締結。若出於後一途徑。則歐洲局面。尙能安定卽出於前一途徑。於歐洲和平。或亦不致卽有妨礙。蓋西歐方面。英意旣已重申其對於洛迦諾公約所負之義務。則法之安全。當可毫無問題。中歐方面。法意等國亦必設法成立保障中歐和平之公約。東歐方面。法俄捷之軍事同盟。自必取東歐公約而代之。故質言之。德國對於英法意之集體和平制度。參加與否。在目前事實上。殊無多大差異。德國知其然也。故於斯特里薩會議將行閉幕之時。突行宣露願締東歐不侵公約之意思。且表示其自身雖不願參加含有軍事同盟性之東歐互助公約。特他國若欲締結。德國亦不反對。此種態度之突變。實為英法意三國態度一致之結果。同時德亦深知歐洲之集體和平。形態已具。倘德國單獨反對。將徒使其自身陷於孤立而已。</p>
<p>由此觀之。斯特里薩會議對於安定歐洲局面。實有相當之效果。吾人敢為歐洲之平和。額手稱慶。然而國際風雲。瞬息千變。歐洲各國之軍備。已因德國實行徵兵制而競謀擴張。加之彼此利害衝突之點。又日積日多。所謂和平。亦惟武裝之和平而已。夫和平而僅僅築在武裝基礎之上。是否容易長保。亦大是疑問。故最近歐洲緊張之局勢。雖已由斯特里薩會議而趨於緩和。而吾人對於歐洲平務局勢之前途。似亦未可遽抱逾量之樂觀耳。</p>
<h3>日外務省擬　調整對美關係　擬派遣實業赴美國考察出淵負親善使命今夏赴澳</h3>
<p>（東京）日外務省首腦部認美國經濟視察團來日、為增進兩國友誼關係之最好機曾、現近考慮種種具體方法、企圖日美親善工作、然試觀現在日美關係、（一）倫敦海軍豫備會議以後之美國對日態度、不無非親善的態度、亞里索那·加利福尼·華盛頓各省議會討論之各種排日的法律案、北太平洋亞留西安羣島方面之空軍根據地建設計劃、太平洋諸島聯絡飛行計劃等、可以證明此事、（二）然美國最近對日態度頗消極、例如關於「滿洲國」煤油專賣問題之抗議、不如英國之强硬、對華借欵問題意見、殆與日本政府之見解同一、（三）美國國內要求變更北太平洋海軍大演習計劃者甚多、英國遠東艦隊訪日作用、有緩和日本對美感情之意味、由此觀之、美國如變更其從來遠東政策、在日本方面最近對華對俄關係潮次改善、釀成友誼空氣、美國朝野所憂慮之日俄紛爭·中日對立等情態已經消滅、因此增進日美親善關係之條件已齊備、然海軍軍縮問題、日英美三國和平協定等政治外交重要懸案、不能一時完全解决、故先由日美通商貿易之發展、企圖建設兩國親善工作之基礎為最適當方法、外務省現有計劃、將於適當時期以有力實業家組織視察團派遣美國、調濟兩國經濟關係並樹立日美親善之第一步方針、（十五日日聯社謂）</p>

<p>（巴黎）各報對於斯特里薩會議結果、除巴黎廻聲報採取保留態度外、均一致表示滿意、以為英法意三國之聯帶關係、由此重言以申之、而安全觀念、亦獲得一大進步、小巴黎大報載稱、「斯特里薩會議所產生之印象、卽有一種鎭靜自持之巨大力量、能在目下并在將來、制止德國出于凌人之舉、」埃克西有報謂、「斯特里蔭會議、係屬歷史、此後英法意三國之聯帶關係、不復為被動者、而為自動者、」「晨報」評論則謂、「英意兩國發表宣言、重申羅加諾條約所規定之義務後、如德國一旦破壞凡爾賽和約中萊茵河左岸撤廢軍備之條欵、則不但破壞凡爾賽條約而已、且係破壞現在之疆界、卽應依照羅加諾條約辦理」云、「斐迦羅報」則謂、「總理佛蘭亭、外長賴伐爾、此行所得結果甚為圓滿、英法意三國之聯帶關係、業經鄭重公開、加以申明、殊足慶幸」云惟「巴黎廻聲報」則表示不滿、謂「若千希望、卽使未完全消失、至少亦未受有鼓勵、惟彼不存奢望之輩、則以為斯特里薩會議、尙屬慰情聊勝於無耳」、「小日報」謂、「此次會議足以注意之點、卽奧國問題極為意國所關心、據非正式徵實之消息、關於至相當時期如何保障奧國獨立之方法、將由各國作詳細之考慮、彼時或將提議訂結某種軍事條約、自屬無疑、惟此種條約、自必於日後另行從事談判」云、「日報」亦作同樣之論調、謂「奧國獨立之保障、因此將採取雙方條約之形式、有關各國如法國意大利及小協商各國、將設法規定遇奧國獨立遭侵犯時應採取之軍事行動」云、此外「日報」又謂、英法意三國、曾在斯特里薩商定、向立陶宛提出警告、請其尊重米美爾區域自治制度」云、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>維也納</p>
<p>視維持奧國土地完整之妥協與在羅馬集會締結中歐公約之决議二事、為中要成續、且視羅馬之會為趨向成立多瑙河諸國間妥協之重要步驟、</p>
<p>匈京</p>
<p>某報　有出於授意之一文、謂匈國須享有完全平等權利、連軍事權利在內、始能加入多瑙河公約而為一分子、</p>
<p>柏林</p>
<p>國社黨各報皆稱期特里薩會議之結果為德國之勝利，會議公報中所述及產生安全之情感以維持和平一節、柏林政界視為各國對於德國所提出安全之要求、已稍加體諒、公報中第五節追述前曾謀以一種協定代替凡爾賽和約中軍事條文云云、柏林視此不啻承認德國重整陸也與天空軍備為已成的事實、惟柏林對於會議未能在原則上循希特勒所示之路徑以達和平、表示遺憾、</p>
<p>美國</p>
<p>之輿情、可以紐約時報之評倫觀之、該報謂國聯之威望與條約之尊嚴、並未喪失於對德國重整軍備所作之調解中、希特勒所發和平之質言、其意非謂渠將轉向和平、不過謂渠不準備作戰耳、但斯特里所會議如僅予各國以休息、在和平上亦屬得計云、（十五日路透電）</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞</p>
<p>維京　法國駐羅馬尼亞公使多爾美松、現將斯特里薩會議决定、尤是關於奧匈保各國重整軍備問題之决定、通吉羅馬尼亞政府、此問世界報對於此項會議結果、不加評論、僅將斯德特里薩發來各電刊載、而冠以標題曰、「歐洲和平已獲救矣」、並謂「此項勝利、應歸諸國聯會、蓋西歐三强在斯特里薩、係依國聯會之精神、完成其和平之努力也、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>捷克</p>
<p>捷京　負責方面對於斯特里薩會議之結果、頗為滿意、對於德國態度多抱樂觀、蓋因德國已不反對簽訂束歐互助公約數　　　於法國此次在斯特里薩會議對於前德國盟國（卽奧匈保三國）變更軍制問題所採之態度、此間負責方面認為尤足使捷克與法國之連鎖因以增强云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>蘇俄</p>
<p>（莫斯科）此間負責方面對於斯特里薩會議之最後公報表示滿意、謂英法意三國現　同意、對於以後如發生破壞條約之情事當合力加以反對、負責方面又以為法俄協定全文、將由法國外長賴伐爾及蘇聯外委李維諾夫在國聯會行政院開會時加以商定、其目的則在於增强國聯會盟約第十第十六第十七各條之效力云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>馬賽發現暗殺之謠　不利於墨里尼賴伐爾　惟巴黎官方謂並無綫</h3>
<p>馬賽據今日所披露之消息、此間警察曾於本月五日拘獲意國無政府主義老剛季爾及其女助手加龍尼、聞該二入擬於斯特萊薩陰謀暗殺意相墨索里尼及法外長賴伐爾、二人自供係屬無政府黨、曾企圖越境暗鈢墨索里尼及賴伐爾、在斯特萊薩未得手、該黨尚派有其他份子跟蹤至日內瓦行事、意國官方車前得此間及歐洲其他城市之警告、遂於斯特萊薩會議時加派警察偵探三千人、特別防範云、（八十五日國民社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）馬賽半官方而所傳之暗殺墨索里尼及賴伐爾陰謀、此間官方今日宣稱、此類陰謀全無綫索、為預防起見、雖有若干行跡可疑者被拘、惟旋卽釋放、故馬賽方面之謠傳尚無從證實、（＋五日國民社電）</p>

<h3>英預算案提出下院　麥唐納趕回出席受歡迎　財相說明工商業有起色　估計收支相抵尚有盈餘</h3>
<p>（倫敦）英財相張伯倫今日午後三時三十四分在下院含笑提出其第四次豫算案、下院座無虛席、旁聽席中亦甚擁擠、英相麥唐納甫由斯特里　歸來、入院就坐時、衆以歡聲迎之、財相發言、首謂過去一年內頗有趨向復興之進步、工業出產增多百分之十二、已成新紀錄、輸出增三千萬鎊、利率始終不高、生活程度仍較一九三一年政府就職時為低、零售貿易逐漸擴大、國人有欣欣向榮之象、渠前所豫料所得稅减六便士定有益一層、現已實現云、張伯倫發言時、自始至終態度從容愉快、在笑聲之中渠詳述糖烟酒消費之增多、並謂娛樂事業已有起色、凡此事態、足徵各方而已有穩健進步、世界中殆未有一處可與英國現狀領頏者、上年盈餘之數、雖為七百五十萬鎊、而收入超過支出不連償債欵、實有一千九百萬鎊之多、鋼之產量增多百分之三十、塊鐵產量增百分之五十、人造絲產量已造成新紀錄、費於調解商業爭論之時問、其短為前所未有、國債已减少二千二百萬鎊、故每年可節省利金一百六十五萬鎊、上年匯兌平凖金頗獲餘利、本年盈餘必可更多、繼述及來年收入情形、謂估計支出為七萬三千萬鎊、尙須另籌國防經費、其數較諸過去一年多一千零五十萬鎊、一九三四年營業狀况旣巳大有起色、豫料所得稅可增一千四百萬鎊、而達二萬三千七百萬鎊之總額、以目前捐稅計算之、估計來年收入約可得七萬三千六百萬鎊、除去支出可盈余五日五十萬鎊、</p>

<h3>七月一日起全市總動員　實施強迫識字敎育　黨政敎介昨參加市府紀念週　由吳市長潘局長報告實施辦法　全體當場宣誓決一致努力完成</h3>
<p>本市玫府於昨日上午九時半、在市府大禮堂舉行了紀念周、邀集全有中小學交長、各級黨部委員、各區市政委員、敎育局公安局職員一律參加、由吳市長潘局長報告實施强迫識字敎育辦法、到塲一千餘人、並當場宣誓决心推行、其空氣之緊張、情緒之熱烈，為前此所未有上海社記特馳往採訪其詳情如次、</p>
<p>千餘人參加市府紀念週</p>
<p>市政府昨特備專車在實山路口接送參加人員、紛紛到達市政府大禮堂、參加者計有市長吳鐵城、市政府全體職員、市敎局長潘公展及敎育局全體職員、市黨部委員陶百川及各區黨部宣傳委員、市公安局長蔡勁軍及公安局科畏各分局長各所所長、市商會、市敎育會、市農會、總工會等各團體代表、全市社敎機關主管人員、各中小學校長及敎務主任、各民衆學校補習學校校長、各區市政委員等千餘人、其情况之熱烈為市府舉行紀念週所僅有、</p>
<p>吳市長報告實施之計劃</p>
<p>由吳市長領導全體行禮如儀後、由市長報告、略謂各位同志、今天市政府</p>
<p>舉行紀念週、請全市公私立各中小學校長敎務主任。各區黨部委員、各區市政委員及市敎局公安局各職員參加紀念週、且的就是要報告上海市在本年七月一日開始實行強迫識字敎育辦法、據敎育部統計、中國四萬萬五千萬人中有百分之八十是不認識字、識字的人是五分之一、我們就這點可以判斷中國在過雲端四十年之新中國運動、到今天還沒有成功、其原因就是中國百分之八十同胞不識字、智識程呀太低、我們新的運動、他不但不能接收、而且不瞭解百分之八十的人民不瞭解、如何可以使全國人民一致努力、我們旣無法使全國人民一致努力、當然國民革命不易成功、靠最少數人努力是不能成功的、</p>
<p>復興民族之九項大運動</p>
<p>中國國民黨最初規定了六項救國運動、第一識字運動、第二造林運動、第三築路運動、第四保甲運動、第五合作運動、第六衛生運動、後來又加了一項國貨運動、去年蔣委員長又參加提倡新生活運動、最近蔣委員長又提倡了經濟建設運動、總共九種運動、都是救亡圖存的中華民族的復興運動、但此種運動旣完全民族的復興運動、就要事個民族起來同時一致努力才可成功、過去四十年在總理領導之下做革命運動、到今日還不能澈底成功、而事實遇空前的國難、就是因為名為救國運動、而事實上是少數人在呼號奔走和努力、多數人在醉生夢死、不知不覺、所以致此之原因、就是在百分之八十以上人民不識字、智識程度太低、不能和我們一致努力、</p>
<p>識字運動為最基本工作</p>
<p>中國國民革命現在已經到了建設時期、建設就是要實行這九項救國大運動、但這幾種運動的先決條件、就在有無方法使全國百分之八十的不識字者全都識字、此問題如不能解決、將來一切運動、其結果和前幾十年一樣、靠最少數人的努力、不能成功的、故我們現在先在上海市來做一個普遍的大規模的識字運動、上海市有三百五十萬人、在道三百五十萬人中、有五分之三是住在市區、五分之　是住在租界、主在市區的五分之三、約計二百萬人左右、其中佔計角五十萬人不識字、這五十萬人是十三歲至五十歲的、換言之、在市區二百萬人中成年　　五十萬人、其餘自六歲至十三歲的失學　　照敎局統計有十五萬人、兩共不識字　有六十五萬人</p>
<p>七月一日起　全市總動員</p>
<p>今年七月一日起開始實行强迫　字敎育、在一年內要全市人民一致動員來解决上海市的文盲問題、換言之、全市人民一致動員、自七月一日起至明年六月三十日止、馮一年之時間與努力、使上海市市區內五十萬成年文盲、與十五萬失學兒童都識字、我們識字敎育之目的有三種、第一是使他識字、第二是使他能知普通常識、第三是實施公民訓練、因為普及敎育不是短期間內少數人所可做到、普及敎育就要實施民衆敎育、識字敎育是民衆敎育之初步、要使不識字者能識字、同時得到相當常識和公民智識、將來無論實施何種運動、他們比較能瞭解、而共同參加帮助實行、我們看市區內苦力觸目皆是、他們不識字、不知國家民族存亡關係、沒有民族意識、這責任全在我們、我們並非生而識字者、不過因家庭環境或際遇之優越、才比他們好、在一萬人中祇有幾個人是有這種機會的、他們因為沒有這種機會、才不知道國家民族、所以我們不能責備他、這責任在政府社會和受敎育者、我們應當負責使他們識字、</p>
<p>上海市成續能影響全國</p>
<p>在全國經濟不景氣中、上海市比較內地的環境要好、上海市的文盲也比較別處要少、我們最大的義務、就是不能有一秒鐘的懈惰、全國各地實施識字敎育、上海市應當先來實施、並且隨時隨刻抱着有絕對成功的信念、上海市有比較別處優越的條件、如果失敗了、就要影響於全國、所以這責任在識字者、尤其是公務員和黨員更要負責任、如不負責任即不配做黨員、不配做今日政府下之公務員、就是辜負了國家社會和自已的父母、上海市識字敎育運動之成敗、與全國識字敎育運動影響很大我們一定要負責使上海市的識字敎育運動成功、</p>
<p>全市共劃分二十二區域</p>
<p>關於實施方法、本市共劃為二十一區、每區設十個學校、每校分六班、每班分成年與兒童兩種、額定五十人、上課分早午晚三次、第一期二月畢業、在二月中敎他識六百字、並能瞭解和運用、敎師由考選二百人至三百人來受短期訓練之後、分派出去來辦識字敎育、並恐平民不能到校上課、故另有校外補習辦法、二個月畢業後也可給他證書、在强迫識字敎育之區內、每人至少要二個人、這是大概的辦法、現已成立識字敎育委員會、籌備工作最重要的調查市區內究有多少不識字者、以為分配學校地位與時間之根據、并劃江灣與滬南為實騐區、其他各區一律五月一日成立、本年七月一日就是上海市開始實施強迫識字敎育的一天、識字敎育是救國運動之基本運動、識字敎育成功、救國運動才有希望、這是今天要報告的大槪、請各位將今天本人報告的向大家宣傳、要喚起全市男女老少都知道全體動員、尚有辦法方面未計到的、請潘局長來補充、</p>
<p>潘局長報告實施之辦法</p>
<p>次潘局長報告略謂、今天聽到市長對本　市實施識字敎育的重要報告不必再說什麼、現奉市長命在辦法方面補充一點、全市教育界、全市政府同事、全市黨部同志、應把此識字教育工作作為切身的事、市長已說到上海市成年文育及失學兒童的總數、這是就市區以內估計的、如整個計算尚不上此數、租界市民也是市府範圍內的市民、但先從市區方面做去、如產用全體總動員去做、這識字教育起碼三百年、假定上海市三百五十萬人有一百萬不識字者、以過去辦去、由教局拿市府經費來辦理民校、三四年內祇不過教出一萬個學生識一千個字、一百萬人、就要三百年才能完成、故一定要改變辦法才能有效、</p>
<p>識敎服務團　識敎互助團</p>
<p>現在全市分二十二區、每區設十校、分早午晚六班、每班五十人、一個月畢業、每區三千人、全市就要六萬六千人、但祇靠此法、還是不行、故另外有兩種校外補習辦法、使不能入校者也可識字、第一是組織識字敎育服務團、凡全市敎育界、中小學校長敎職員及年齡較大的學生為組織中心、全體公務昌黨昌也加入此團、團內人可以到人家去或派出去找不識字者去敎他、第二是組織識字敎育互助團、在家庭、工廠或商店內、每一個單位中的識字者組織一個互助團、所有該單位中的不識字者、其不能人校讀書的、就帮助敎他、道兩種組織就是達到不能入校的不識字者也有識字之機會、</p>
<p>期滿不識字查出應懲罰</p>
<p>照上面這二種辦法、在　年內市區範圍內可以做到、即特區之內如一年內也有人願意去服務、我想也一完可以完成的、祇要我們下决心去做、將來一年完成後要請市長規定一種法則、到明年六月底、以後查出　不識字、一定要懲罰、山公安局嚴厲執行、這樣一面勸導、一面又要懲罰、一定沒有人不願意識字的、其次我們要明白、敎不識字者識六百個字、並不是算做到普及敎育、這是初期的辦法、如一年內有效、明年可進行第一期、故各位不要誤會以為上海市普及敎育祇要二個月、最後我們知道蘇俄使前也是百分之八十以上不識字、而且比中國還要困難、可是從一九一七年革命以後、到現在不過十七年、結果現在是百分之八十以上是識字的、其次土耳其也是一樣、故中國要建設、要復典、不能忽略於此去、</p>
<p>吳市長領導全體讀誓詞</p>
<p>最後由吳市長提出共同　誓以表决心、全體鼓掌贊成、空氣異常緊張、即由吳市長領導、本體高畢右乎、宣讀誓詞如下、為復興中華民族、建設中華民國、永遠切實努力、依照上海市政府識字敎育辦法、負貴敎導不識字的民衆、以完成木市識字敎育運動、謹此宣誓、</p>
<h3>財孔談救濟工商業　決定放欵二千萬元　抵押一千五百萬信用五百萬　由中央等三行會同公會辦理　嚴禁運銀出國以免影響市面</h3>
<p>新聲社云、美國繼續提高銀價、我國朝野、均籌劃應付、藉免感受不良影響、經中國銀行董事長宋子文氏、與各外商銀行領袖交換意見後、昨晨、宋子文業將其經過、報告於財長孔祥熙民、孔氏旋於下午召集金融各界、交換銀問意見、並晤談救濟工商業、決定以二千萬現欵、由中·中·交·三行、會同銀行公會辦理放欵、孔事畢後、已於昨晚入京、宋氏則準今晨十時、在中國銀行、接見記者、茲分誌詳情如次、</p>
<p>宋昨訪孔</p>
<p>中國銀行董事長宋子文氏、於昨午十一時二十分、訪晤財長孔祥熙氏於中央銀行、報告前午寧氏在宅歡宴英。美·法·日·各國銀行界要人時、對銀價問顆所交換各種意見、及中外各銀行此後合作以維持市面之辦法等、至十一時四十五分辭出、返中國銀行辦公、</p>
<p>交換意見</p>
<p>美國提高銀價問題、前午除由宋子文氏召集外商各銀行界晤談外、昨日下午四時半、孔氏特在中央銀行、召集金融各界交換意見、計到會參加者、有中國銀行總經理宋漢章·滬行總經理貝淞蓀·交通銀行總經理唐壽民·中南銀行總經理胡筆江·大陸銀行總經理葉扶霄·及中央銀行副總裁陳行·業務局經理席德懋·財部錢幣司長徐堪等多人、晤談約一小時之久、至五時半始散、據關係人稱、會中除討論救濟工商業辦法外、對銀問題、亦曾交換意見、但因此事關係市面甚鉅、故均未允有何發表、</p>
<p>救濟工商</p>
<p>財政部長孔祥熙、於昨日下午五時、在中央銀行、接見各報社記者、首談關於救濟工商業、業經與銀行界會商、决定具體辦法總額為二千萬元、分抵押担保放欵、及信用保證放欵二種、决定抵押担保放欵一千五百萬元、信用保證放欵五百萬元、由中央·中國·交通·三銀行、會同銀行業同業公會辦理、俟命令發出後、卽行會同舉辦之、</p>
<p>對美應付</p>
<p>孔對美國提高銀價之應付問題、復申述前日之談話、謂平衡稅儘足以應付美國之提高銀價、不過此時未能立卽提高平衡稅率、以免外匯放長、而予國內工商業以不利、現此事已由中央中國兩銀行、愼重應付、同時各外商銀行、亦知於市面有關、一律表示願共同合作、以維持市面、决不運銀出口、企圖營利、至外交方面之行動、孔氏謂、現正在進行中、並未停化、不過抗議與否、則因美國此次係宣布提高在國內購買之銀價、並非向國外提高銀價購買、故情形略有不同也、</p>
<p>取締投機</p>
<p>孔氏最後稱、業投機者、應顧全大體、各外商銀行、且知運銀出口之影響市面、而有種種良好之表示、頃據報有本埠北四川路某小錢莊·及厦門方面錢莊·竟有擬運銀出口之說、此種不能體量整個國家而單獨為一已圖利者、實乃漢奸也、現下除已電令各海關嚴緝私運、同時中國銀行宋董事長、亦已電中國分行辦事處、向各該地商行勸告、切勿貪圖私利、而礙大體云、</p>
<p>平衝稅率</p>

<p>入川遊覽</p>
<p>據李氏談、本人慕四川之名勝已久、此次與張靜江·吳稚暉·兩氏聯袂入川、純為遊覽風景、絕無政治作用、余等到川、適蔣委員長業已離川赴黔、蔣委員長原定六日返川、本人與張先生待至九日、蔣委員長仍未返川、是故先行離川、並未晤及蔣委員長、至於吳先生以近遊黃山、深感黃山風景之美、達於極點、故特前往峨嵋一遊、以作比較、</p>
<p>川省建設</p>
<p>本人在川、共計勾留十日、五日留重慶、五日漫遊北涪及溫泉兩地、盧作孚氏在該處舉辦實業及新村、頗為努力、若科學館·博物院·動物園·圖書館·醫院·中學·小學·民衆俱樂部·及民衆敎育館等、無不俱備、尙有一北川鐵路、專作運煤之用、更有一人工開築之運河、兩岸皆關公園、欲借人工及風景之力、以造成一工業之區域、舉凡紡織廠·媒球廠·製冰廠·及各種機器工業、莫不俱備、設若全川均能如北涪·及溫泉·兩地之努力建設、則四川前途、誠屬未可限量、四川雖連年戰爭、惟民氣醇厚、恢復殊屬易事、關於川中勦匪軍事、本人並無所聞、</p>
<p>否認南行</p>
<p>連日外間盛傳本人將於日內南下一行之說、實非確詞、本人耳聞廣西桂林風景之美、頗思前往一遊、然此願望、何日始得實現、實難預料、外傳本人日內南下之說、恐卽因此而誤傳也、國際文化會議、定於七月間開會、本人决往出席、吳稚暉先生亦係委員之一、業已數年未往出席、故本人今年擬與偕往云、</p>

<h3>濬浦總局向德訂造　巨型挖泥船已抵滬　船泊張華浜工廠碼頭　查總工程師親往迎候　二星期後面駛銅沙試騐　濬挖神灘開工已密邇</h3>
<p>大通社云、濬浦總局為濬挖吳淞口外神灘、（卽銅沙門沙）向德國雪高造船公同、訂造世界最大挖泥船一艘、該船在德竣工後、卽於二月八日開駛來華、歷時二月有餘、始於前日（十四）下午一時三十分抵滬、茲誌各情如下、</p>
<p>在德監造竣工經過</p>
<p>該船在德建造、已歷二年、先由雪高公司六愛爾賓（Elbing）機器廠、將機器部份完工、卽載赴檀城（Danzing）船塢、裝配船壳、於本年一月底、始行完工、該船因係濬浦總局查總工稈師設計、故該局特派挖泥科工程師西人斯密司、（Smith）華工稈員朱重熙、在德監造、該船船身、計長三百六十呎、闊六十呎、吃水為十八呎、每小時挖泥量達三千噸、造價折華幣約為二百五十萬元、（該船聞定名為建設號）</p>
<p>前日抵滬船員大槪</p>
<p>自竣工後、乃於二月八日、自檀城啟駛來華、其行程係由基爾運河、出直布羅陀海峽、渡地中海、取道蘇彝士運河、歷紅海·印度洋·經西貢·香港·歷時二個月又六日、始於前（十四）日中午進吳淞口、下午一時三十分、並靠張華浜濬浦總局工廠碼頭、隨該船來滬者、計有雪高公司所派船主約翰生（Johannsen）、大車阿恩特脫、（Arndt）曁以下船員約三十人之譜、</p>
<p>總工程師親往迎候</p>
<p>至在德監造之該局挖泥科工程師斯密司、係另搭郵船來滬、故早於一月前抵滬、華工程員朱重熙則隨船於前日到達、惟前日適為星期日、而該船所發通知到滬時問之無綫電報、亦於同日早晨始到、故當該船並岸前、僅該局總工程師查得利博士、挖泥科工程師刁密司二人、在碼頭迎候、</p>
<p>先在銅沙　試騐效率</p>
<p>大通社記者、昨日下午、曾訪謁該局查總工程師、據查氏談、該船抵滬後、先將試騐其效率、試騐地點、卽就吳淞口外銅沙灘、（亦卽神灘附近）是項試騐、須二星期後開始、屆時由查氏親自率同主要工程技術人員八人、共同試騐、至需時若干日、始可試騐完竣、此時尙難預揣</p>
<p>濬挖神灘開工密邇</p>
<p>查氏繼謂、關於銅沙閂沙測量工程、早經海道測量完竣、故一待試騐該船效率畢事、卽可正式開工濬挖、關於接收及命名等事宜、亦待試騐後行之、至濬挖銅沙閂沙工程、定期為五年、自低潮時十七呎深度、浚深至二十六呎、闊度為一千呎、長度為二十英里、至該灘位置、在吳淞口外之東約三十英里、距離揚子江口約二十英里、適當揚子江入海口之中心云、家得觀一物、而沾沾自喜之陋習云、</p>

<h3>潘公展氏　對於國產影片之意見　取材應注重美化人生不良影評主加以取締</h3>
<p>中央社云、中央宣傳委員會、因影片關係文化教育至鉅、故對於國產影片業、指導扶助、向來不遺餘力、前日在滬召集各影片公司負責人舉行第二次談話會、討論發展影業之各項問題、集思廣益、結果至為圓滿、聞今後中央除對於審查劇本檢查影片、仍本歷來方針、繼續辦理外、並將隨時取締各刋物之不良影評、以正視聽、本市教靑局長潘公展氏、前日被邀出席談話會、即席發表意見、對於取締不良影片一點、亦認為切要之圖、茲補錄潘氏在談話會中發表之意見如左、中國的電影市塲、自外國有聲影片流入以後、給了國片個發展的機會、然而中國的製片公司、因資本的短絀、對於國片的發展、不免有許多的限制、故此時我們應如何使政府當局、與各製片公司合作互助、以及各公司與各公司間的如何來相都助、彼此合作、以推進國片之發展、實是目前一個很重要的問題、目前有一秤奇怪的現象、就是政府的希望、和報界的輿論、以及觀衆們的對於影片的批評、有時顯得非常的矛盾、甚至是背道而馳的、這固然對於社會上勢必會引起一種不良的印象、同時使得影片商也弄得無所適從、因此各公司的出品、也顯得彼此矛盾、步伐凌亂了、但各製片公司、如能認淸了一個共同目標、即大家都能在如何復興民族的道一大前題上去努力、我想當亦不難獲得大體上的統一、一些枝節問題的小出入、那是不成問題的、其次、目前電影界有一種趨勢、就是趨向於所謂寫實主義的充分暴露社會罪惡、這條路、以為這就是電影的目的、那麼我以為一切的社會罪惡、實無須我們冉去暴露、因為社會的罪惡、不是天天在那兒暴露着嗎、只要我們大家去留心觀察一下、不就都看到了嗎、何必一定要電影去再為暴露呢、並且此種所謂暴露社會罪惡的影片、所投於社會上的暗影、是非常巨大的很容易誘致一般人趨於黑暗的方面去、許多犯罪的行為、本為一般人所不知道的、但因電影上的盡量暴露了出來、其結果不啻是吿訴人以種種如何去犯罪的方法、所以電影的正確的目的、不是在於暴露、而是在乎指示、藝術不是僅止於描幕事實、而應該是將事實以另一種美妙的方式使之表達、决不是搬演一次事實、就算了事的、所以電影的目的、應以美化人生的觀念、去引導人們到更高尙的生活中去、再次、目前電影界還有一種不良的現象、就是迷信他人崇拜外國的觀念、這一點、我們是應該加以改革的、我們决不能對於他人以為好的對的東西、自己也應該以為是好的、是對的、我們决不能傘別的國家所走的路綫、也拿來應用於中國、蘇俄果然是一個社會主義的國家、但三民主義何嘗不是社會主義呢、我們實行三民主義、也就是實行社會主義、別的國家的所謂社會主義、是不能適於中國的國情的、但現在中國電影界、大家以為只有蘇俄的東西、才是社會主義的、這是一個極大的錯誤、所以造成此種錯誤的風氣之原因、並不是製片公司、或是演員們的自己的志願、實在是一般無聊的文人、利用了影評道個工具、來咸脅一般不附和他們的路綫的人、有以致之、以前梅蘭芳去美國的時候、一般所謂左翼作家、都把他攻擊得體無完膚、但這一次梅蘭芳到蘇俄去了、為什麼這一般人反一句話也沒有了呢、這是多麼的荒謬、所以我們認為中央如果要求電影得有正確的發展、必須要先從肅淸這種不良現象着手、我們希望中央要拿出大公無私的態度來肅淸這種惡劣現象、對於不良的影評、均應加以嚴厲的取締、</p>

<h3>江南排球盟主失利　復旦昨竟敗於南敏　表演精彩非凡結果三比二　今日南敏最後一戰對滬江</h3>
<p>江南十餘年排球盟主復旦大學排球隊、昨竟以二比三之比數、敗於華北冠軍大津南開大學南敏隊、出於意料之外、誠排球界驚人之戰績、昨日下午三時、二隊會師於江灣復旦球傷、復旦除遠東名將丘廣燮外、並有前排能員徐亨臨時加入客串、陣容十分鞏固、無奈平時缺少練習、聯絡不週、防禦疏忽、致為北軍所乘、南敏隊人材平均、救球出色、攻擊亦甚兇猛、雙方表演、精彩非凡、在塲五百餘觀衆、莫不眉飛色舞、嘆為奇觀、今日為南敏征滬之最後一戰、對手為滬江、在楊樹浦滬江交鋒、昨戰經過如下、</p>
<p>喧賓奪主</p>
<p>南敏開球即得一分、復旦隨即加倍奉還、反以二對一佔先、此後竟風雲變色、南敏前排、利用峻急之壓球、連得六分、由二對二而至八對三、復旦乃亡命追趕、小心翼冀、瞬息間造成十八對十六、相差僅二分、而南敏首排之汪劉二將、又施其迅雷不及掩耳之壓殺、使復旦無法招架、乃以二十一對十六輕取第一局、</p>
<p>再接再厲</p>
<p>開球後、南敏乘勝後之餘威、猛力進攻、着着立功、分數乃扶搖直上、成七對六、八對六、八對七、復旦乃猛力襲擊、迭成雙八、丘廣變聳身一擊、反以九對八佔先、但南敏又逞兇、山雙十而至十一對十、換邊後、南敏一帆風順、以二十一對十五勝第二局、</p>
<p>反攻得利</p>
<p>復旦沌負一局、並不氣餒、全隊乃鼓勇猛攻、雙方戰來精彩異常、復旦開球後、達東選手丘廣燮乃大顯好身手、鐵臂舉處、南敏竟望風披靡、於是南敏陣綫、頓現於混亂狀態之中、頃刻間、復旦即山十七比十六而起出、風勢旣轉後、　旦乃　　　　　　　　　　　　　　返回一局、</p>
<p>造成平手</p>
<p>復旦老將徐亭斯時適趕到、乃加入戰團、調去前排中堅之周潔明、徐胸有成竹、滿面笑容、時能挽狂瀾於旣倒、博得四座掌聲不少、分數乃靑雲直上、山二比〇而二十一比十、比數始終佔前、乃造成二對二之平手局面、</p>
<p>奠定勝局</p>
<p>局勢旣成平均、雙方乃各出全力來攻、戰情山是益見緊張、雙方攻守、出神入化、南敏發球兇猛、而復旦之前排、均屬扣壓之聖乎、一攻一守、比數接近、由一對一、八對八、而至十八對十八、十九對十九、此時緊張萬分、四週觀衆均熱烈鼓掌歡呼、南敏之劉志聰發球得一分、復旦之徐亨反扣亦得一分、雙方又成二十比二十之平局、南敏汪紹誠連獲二分、始以二十二比二七奠定勝局、</p>

<h3>吳市長演講　文化建設與讀書運動　今日下午三時一刻中西電台　章淵若講演怎樣研究法律學</h3>

<p>建設階段　今天承中國文化建設協會之邀、來此作關於全國讀書運動大會播昔演講、謹就「文化建設與讀書運動二題、以說明中國文化建設協會所以舉辦全國讀書運動大會之意義、我們要知道、中國革命運動、隨着空間時開客觀的需要而開展、已經進展到一個新的階段、這一個新的階段特徵、就是建設、唯建設、始能實現革命的理想、唯建設、始能解除民衆的疾苦、唯建設、始得充實國家的實力、而企圖民族的復興、我們還要淸楚、目前中國社會、巳到了一個靑黃不接、新陳代謝急轉　　的劃時代的階段、這時呈現在眼前新現象　　便在目前的新問題、旣不是傳習的故智、或偏狄的成見所可解决、尤不是情感的衝動、暴激的行為所可濟事、此時急不及待的工作、就是要藍籌建設的計劃、充實建設的能力、尤其要把人民的智識能力充分的培養起來、把人民程度、文化水準普遍的提高起來、這一椿工作、好比是一個偉大建築物的基礎、俞是做得澈底、俞將成其偉大、决不能急於求切、或長其艱難、而　等忽視、</p>
<p>持久努力　過去的維新運動者、社會運動者、甚至許多文化運動者、似乎都沒有注意這一點、所以已往各種運動、雖曾轟轟烈烈、一度發生時代的動盪力、然而這種時代的動盪力、却都隨着時間的過馳而消沈、而大羣的民衆、尤其沒有承受這種力的準備、所以一切運動形式上的開展、旣沒有他附托的根基、而一切運的理想、尤與大羣民衆的智識程度、發生相去萬里的大空隙、甚至轅轍背馳的大危險、這是已往一切運動之所以未能收效的總因緣、中國文化建設協會、深識了這一個歷史的教訓、認淸了目前時代的需求、樹起「文化建設」的大　、脚踏實地的循着社會演進必由的階段、作充實國力、復興民族的基本工作、這一次的文化運動、非但負有重大歷史使命、並且還有分劃時代的重要意義、</p>
<p>讀書意義　然而文化建設、不是一個新奇的名詞、不是一個空洞的標語、而是一種切實的工作、同時、文化建設不是少數人的理想、不是少數人的工作、而是大羣民衆所應共同分擔的責任、而且唯有為大衆共同分擔了以後、才有他的實際、這一個意義上、在這一個關係上、讀書運動、非但是整個文化建設運動中、必然應有之序幕、而且還是完成文化建設之最基本而最切要的工作、所以誠書運動的重要使命、是在文化水華的提高、而隨着文化水準的提高、自然就能具體而普遍的表現文化建設的成績、因此我們還可以說、文化建設、固是我們今後充實國力、復興民族的基本工作、而如何建設文化、則在民智淺陋、文盲充塞的中國、卻又不能不以讀書運動為完成這一個重大使命的前期工作、</p>
<p>復興基點　一般國民、僅知羨慕近代歐洲學術文化的發展、殊不知在百年之前、他們人民的智識、社會狀態、我們都有過之而無不及、他們所以能突飛猛晋、成為近代世界新文化的策源地、而其社會狀態、人民程度、生活方式、所以有長足的進步者、亦無非是他們舉國上下、一致而普遍的在智識上努力加工之結果、日本的維新、和我們同時並興、而且日本民族自已的文化程度與我們比較我們有遠過之而無不及、然而他們只經數十年的努力、都已能在科學文化昌明的現代、大露頭角也無非是他們努力求知的、結果耳、在上述的中國和東西各國的歷史上、我們可以得到一個民族盛衰的原則、現代民族的鬥爭、不是單純武力的鬥爭、而是智力的鬥爭、科學的鬥爭、文化的鬥爭、我們要復興、要自强、要從這樣落後狀况之，下掙扎起來、以自躋於眞正自由平等的地位、則惟有順從這一個歷史的原則、上下一致的、大家在智識求進步、創建我們民族文化科學的基礎、要在這一個基礎上、求自强、求復興、求國家平等、求民族的發展、才有把握、才有實際、總之、我們要復興民族、就要建設民族的文化、就要培養民族的智力、提高文化的水準、這就是中國文化建設協會所以提倡全國讀書運動大會的意義、完了、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （輝仙）</p>
<p>阻礙不是我們的仇敵，而實是恩人。阻礙之來，可以鍛鍊起我們「克服阻礙」的種種勢力。森林中的　樹，要不）曾同暴風猛雨搏鬬過千百回，就不能樹幹長得十分結實。同樣，人不遭遇種種阻礙，他的人格，本領，也是不會長得結實的。所以一切的磨折，憂苦，與悲哀，都是足以助長我們，鍛鍊我們的。</p>
<p>能力是抵抗困難的結果。偉人都是同困難角國中產生出來的。不同困難阻礙奮國，而想要鍛鍊出能耐來，是不可能的，「生前沒有鍜鍊，死時只能算作半個人！」</p>
<h3>麻將的考證</h3>
<p>— 希旦</p>
<p>前幾年麻將牌忽然行到海外，成為出口貨的一宗，歐洲與美洲的社會裏，很有許多人學打麻將的，後來日本也傳染到了，有一個時期，麻將竟成了西洋社會裏最時髦的一種遊戲，俱樂部中差不多桌桌都是麻將，書店裏出了許多種研究麻將小冊子，中國留學生沒有錢的可以靠教麻將吃飯掙錢，但他們這種狂熱，不久也就退凉，决不會做麻將的信徒，决不會受麻將的征服，麻將只是我們這種好閒愛蕩不惜光陰的民族的專利品。</p>
<p>關於它的歷史過程，也有悠久的時期，當明代晚年，民間盛行紙牌，名為「馬弔」。馬弔只有四十張牌，有一文至九文，一千到九千，一萬到九萬，等於麻將牌的筒子索子萬子，還有一張「零」，卽是「白板」的祖宗，馬弔牌上，每張畫有水滸傳的人物，徽州紙牌上的「王英」，卽是矮脚虎王英的遺跡，乾隆嘉慶間人汪師韓的全集裏，收有幾種明人的馬弔牌。</p>
<p>馬弔在當日風行一時，士大夫整日整夜的打馬弔，把正事都荒廢了。所以吳梅邨做綏寇記略說，明之亡，是亡於馬弔。</p>
<p>三百年來四十張的馬弔，逐漸化變成每樣四張的麻將牌，（馬弔三人對一人，故名「馬弔脚」，省稱馬吊，麻將是「馬脚」的音變。）變複的巧妙，更能使國人迷惑在一百三十六張脾上。</p>
<h3>老胡</h3>
<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>老胡，眞是一個妙人，他能適應着環境。</p>
<p>前年，他在某機關裏當小職員，收入不怎麼豐厚的，所以自奉是很刻苦，衣服是穿得不怎麼漂亮的，終年總是那麼的一件自由呢的長褂兒。他自己是那麼刻苦不算，見了朋友，也總是勸人要刻苦，而同時，還得以某某的任意揮霍為戒，說的是這種浪費金錢，是不可為訓的。</p>
<p>去年他突然由小職員，升為科長了。於是他的生活，便起了大大的一個轉變，住着大房子，穿着挺漂亮的衣服，呼奴使婢，十分闊綽。在那個時期裏，我輩老朋友，是不怎麼容易和他見面了。就是見了面，他也總是說，「人壽幾何，有得享樂不享樂，豈非是獃子」？</p>
<p>今年，他失意了。局長換了，他也跟着走了，速原來的小職員位置，也丟了。於是他立卽把塲面收縮下來，收縮到了比小職員時代更刻苦的生活。而同時呢，見了朋友，也突然地親熱了，見了得意的朋友，是那麼的親熱，見了失意的朋友，也是那麼的親熱，，——不拘對誰，都是那麼親熱得無話不談。</p>
<p>所以朋友之中，沒一個不說，「老胡，眞是一個妙人，他能適應着境環」，</p>
<h3>最後的一條路</h3>
<h3>賣新聞與賣朝報</h3>
<p>— 宋哲旺</p>
<p>「喔唷！希奇希奇眞希奇，浦東出仔話把戲，有個八十歲老頭子，搭仔七歲個姑娘做夫妻，花轎裏向就養小弟弟，眞正新鮮話把戲，一隻銅板買轉去，看看實在眞有趣。」</p>
<p>以前在上海衖堂裏常聽見這種「賣新聞」的人手裏拿着幾張惡劣的石印圖畫，內容不值識者一笑，全靠他嘴裏說得天花亂墜，引動一般無知者去上當。</p>
<p>在我們的兒童時代，曾經見過一種「賣朝報」的小販，他的背後像扯篷似的扯着一個方的書挿，一面畫圖，一面寫字，手裏拿着面唱春的小鑼，肩頭的藍布袋裏放着幾冊黃簿面的小冊子，這就是「賣朝報」。</p>
<p>賣朝報的一路敲着小鑼聚集聽衆，隨口宣講着一件案情的大概，他們大半也都是杜造謠言，例如：通州的殺子報，就是當年朝報的一種。</p>
<p>賣朝報也是一種走江湖生意，他們印了一種小冊子，就能靠此遊歷三關六碼頭，從前的人愛惜名譽，如果自已的事，被人編成朝報出賣，認為莫大恥辱，所以賣朝報人就利用這個弱點，往往有些敲竹槓性質了。</p>
<p>從前賣朝報的是終身職業，現在的賣新聞是野鷄生意，賣朝報可說是中國最早發明的新聞紙，自從報紙風行全國以後，賣朝報的職業便逐漸衰落以至消滅了，自從報紙登了希奇古怪的社會新聞以後，「賣新聞」的生意也被報館先生搶光了。</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十一回　慚愧沒衣裳垂帷避客辛勤省膏火拂曉抄書</p>
<p>月英也是被他說得不好意思，就掀起一片透濕的衣襟，揉擦着眼睛。志前道：你這不是儘哭的事。你果然沒有衣服，那怕先借兩件不合身的衣服也可以。就算找不着女人的衣服，暫借男子的衣服穿，也未見得碍事，總比這週身濕透了强的多。他這樣說着話時，月英站的所在，被他身上的積水流了下來，在地面上滴了一個濕的圈圈。志前低頭向脚下水圈子看看，胡嫂子究竟是月英的舅娘，看了這樣子，也有些不忍心，便道：你就聽程老爺的話，到他屋裏去躱躱罷。我到前面去和你說一聲，說你不能來了，我想你眞是跌了一身透濕，你不去，賈老爺也不能怪你。我和你出個主意，你和茶房要一床被，股下衣服，把身子一捲，我去替你把衣服烤乾了，再來接你。志前道：何必向茶房借一床被呢？你就到我房裏去，把房門關上，把帳子放下，鑽到我被裏睡去就是了，我不進房。胡嫂子道：他關了房門，他的衣服，怎麼得出來呢？志前道：我不過這樣的說，並不要你這樣辦。我現在到朋友屋子裏去坐坐，你就到我房裏去罷。說時，呌了茶房吿訴了一聲，竟自冒雨走向前院去了。浣花聽着，都不免受了一番感動，想不到小西天飯店裏會有這樣好的人。（一八三）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>當一雙新的鞋子完全製就以後必須馬上送到太后跟前去，請伊老人家鑒定；如其逢到伊恰巧很空聞的時候，伊就會細細的檢視起來，所以偷工减料的情形，是絕對不會有的。只是也未必雙雙體能適合太后的尊意，伊往往看了一看便派人送往那一間「鞋庫」裏去，教那兩個太監收管起來，也許從此就不再去取出來了。難得逢到有一兩雙鞋子做得特別的投其所好，那伊就不會輕輕放過了：伊的記憶力原是極好的，見過了便不會忘記了，並且還會暗暗地打定一個主意，這雙新鞋子將於那一個特別的佳節上穿起來，及至到了那個日子，伊老人家再也不會遺忘，隔夜就得教人去把它取出來了。</p>
<p>上面我所說的製鞋所用的工具之中，有一部份就是小型的繡床。繡床的式樣和一架織布機約略相似：繡花的姑娘們，便端端正正地坐在它的裏面。這繡床的主要點是一個綳架，架上緊緊地綳着一方貢緞：這方貢緞的面積的模是二尺高，五尺闊，必須棚得非常的緊，像大皮鼓的面上所釘的一張皮一樣的緊而且平，因為非如此是不能供刺繡用的。我們如其站到那繡床的旁邊去，便可以眼看着一雙雙的鞋面，打這些女工的靈活而純熟的手指下，漸漸地形成起來。在這一間正殿上，大約排着十架的繡床，每架上都有一方貢緞綳着，並且還分別指定着一個女工，負責刺繡。（二九三）</p>

<h3>市中心區巡禮</h3>
<p>— 孫育才</p>
<p>到過市中心區的人，其對於市中心區的感覺，我想一定會有一個共同點，那就是莊嚴，偉大，淸潔，整齊，沉浸在柔和的自然懷抱裏。</p>
<p>市中心區是我國上海最高行政機關的所在地，它應該莊嚴，偉大，淸潔，整齊。當每一個外人到上海的時候，這是給他們的第一個印象，尤其是外交官。他們從這裏更曉得中國建築的優美。</p>
<p>由寳山路口乘市政府公共汽車，從綠紗窗中觀到兩旁的田畝裏有不少的靑苗，過了復旦大學，沒多時，在蒼茫的碧落裏，就可以看到一座宮殿式的建築，巍巍的矗立着，那就是市政府。在它的兩旁，有兩座長方形的建築，那就是市政府所屬各局，教育局，衛生局，社會局，工務局，以及土地局，在公務土地前邊，是五幢職員宿舍，佈置得簡潔精雅，前兩幢裏我們可以聽到女人和小孩的聲音，那是可以住家眷的。市政府前面是圖書館和愽物館，那是兩個在中國比較完備的文化機關，將來的圖書標本，一定都極豐富。圖書館旁邊有一座羅馬式的建築，矗立在那裏別有丯姿，是新辦的一所政衷小學，再加上設備上的完全，這是在中國所不可多得到的。從政衷小學橫跑過去，就到建築中的東亞第一個運動塲體育館和游冰池，其規模的宏大，實為東亞從前所未有，下屆的全國運動大會，已决定在這裏舉行，運動疲倦的人，可以立刻得到個遊息的地方，徘徊於紅榭綠樹間，因為在運動傷的近邊，就是座很大的市公園。還有市立醫院，和衛生試騐所等等，也正在大興土木中。至於市政府裏面，一座大禮堂和一座市政會議室，其偉大富麗，實為從來所未見，我雖到過南京，但沒有瞻仰過鐵道部交通部，不知牠們比起來，究竟如何？</p>
<p>我們曉得市中心區的開闢，才不過兩三年還有許多沒有完成的地方。等到完備的時候，我想一定會有一本市中心區遊覽指南出現咧。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>並非「文人相輕」</h3>
<p>— 另境</p>
<p>近日曹聚仁先生在自由談上論「文人相輕」，引了許多文藝史上的掌故，彷彿「文人相輕」確是「自古而然」的，因此現下的文人也「相輕」似乎是不足為怪了。曹先生的結論，以為「相輕」並不是文壇的惡現象，古今中外的文學是這樣才進步了的，只要不是「人身攻擊」，是應該有而且必然會有的。這個結論我以為是不能算很妥當的。</p>
<p>因為「文人相輕」卽使不是「人身攻擊」，然究不能說是文壇的好現象。卽照曹子桓的說法，「文人相輕」的原因是在「各以所長，相輕所短」，曹聚仁先生認這現象可算是一種「批評」，但這種批評的方法究亦不能作為我們的規範的。為什麼？因為這種批評的方式在批評學上說是直覺的批評，直覺批評的出發點是主觀的感情衝動，這感情衝動的成分是成見，意氣，嫉妬，學理的成分往往是極少的，卽從曹先生所列舉的許多掌故中，幾乎沒有一條不是直覺批評（要是固然稱的上「批評」兩字的話）的最好例子。戰鬥是進步的一種動力，批評是戰鬥中的一部分，所以一切社會意識形態都是需要批計的，但批評者一定要站在一個社會的立塲上，並非是個人任性的「相輕」就可充數的，卽所「輕」的確是實實在在，也不過徒見其量狹，於文壇大局是不會有多少帮助的。我們不是常聽見人說中國新文壇上還不見產生批評家麼？然而「文人相輕」的事實却是我們國手都可拾得一打二打的，要不是我們「故自菲薄」，則呼喊的人將都是無理取鬧了！</p>
<p>卽退一步言，「文人相輕」確是「自古而然」的，然亦不足為現在的我們取法的。夫人類的根性中原有一種嫉妬的氣分存在的，這種嫉妬是根源於自我生存，在原始的社會裏就是弱肉强食，在進步的社會裏則有團體的競爭，勝利者存在而失敗者滅亡。不過我們要注意的，這種競爭，是人類文明的結果，原是勝負决定於個人的體力的到這時已被决於團體之社會基礎和歷史任務，故個人體力雖强，要是他所屬的社會基礎是崩潰的，則這人還是要失敗的。如章太炎之「輕」梁啟超，一者是代表行將崩潰的封建階級，一者是代表新興的資產階級，到現在勝負已經判明，我們除了罵章太炎一句「開倒車」，我們實在不能再如曹先生所說的「一方面要適合時代的需要，一方面要切切實實的學問」的那種判斷的。切切實實的學問豈不要適合時代乎？想曹先生亦將為之失笑了。照這樣的「相輕」實是「相爭」了，豈可一筆歸入「自古而然」的「文人相輕」中乎？在古代的「文人相輕」中是找不出一個這種例子來的。</p>
<p>從此，我的結論也就來了，「文人相輕」雖「自古而然」，但因其出發點僅限於自我生存的嫉妬，不足為現代文壇中的範式，我們要的是含有社會價值的「文人相輕」！</p>
<h3>兩位太太</h3>
<p>— 欽文</p>
<p>有本國的輪船可搭，總得搭本國的輪船：况我急於到校，最近開行的，是隻本國輪船。可是，</p>
<p>「恐怕鋪位已經沒有了；」</p>
<p>船票局一裏的夥計這樣對我說。接著一句「且去問問看，」他就偕著我走向碼頭，到了輪船上帳房的門口，夥計高聲發言，「要一個鋪位，是全票的！」</p>
<p>「啊喲！鋪位！」同音從帳房裏出來。</p>
<p>「是全票的呢！請設法辦一辦罷！」夥計又說。他把「全票一兩個字的聲昔拉得很長，說得非常響亮。當初我聽得莫名其妙，過了一會兒才記淸楚，搭本國輪船原可以買半票，買半票的本很多。近來我老是搭外國輪船，竟把這種情形生疏了，實在是可以慚愧的。</p>
<p>由夥計向帳房商量的結果，把我引到了船後頭，在兩個小房間的中央。</p>
<p>「現在有男客人來了，別處己沒有空位子，請你們兩位女客共一個房問罷！」帳房先向左面的一間這樣說。</p>
<p>「好罷！」回答的是個二十五六歲的婦人，肩背上滿披著頭髮，正在把剪短了的頭髮重行養長起來的樣子。</p>
<p>帳房轉向右面的一間，照前的說。回答的也是「好罷　」不過由一個勤務兵轉言，看不明白裏面的情形。</p>
<p>「那末，就請搬過去罷　」帳房又說。</p>
<p>勤務兵旋轉身子去了，咕嚕了一下才回轉身來回答，「甚們的太太說，由那邊的太太搬過來好了！」</p>
<p>於是帳房去要求左面房間裏的女客搬動，但她也拒絕了，說是共房間常然可以，她可不搬到別個女人的房間裏去。</p>
<p>帳房又同右面房間裏的人去說。重行咕嚕了起來；</p>
<p>「他們的太太不肯搬過來，難道咱們的太太是肯搬過去的麼？」勤務兵大聲的說，很是理直氣壯的樣子。</p>
<p>「兩位太太，一個樣子：」賬房皺了眉頭顧自喃喃的說，「這邊的太太不肯搬過去，那邊的太太不肯搬過來！」</p>
<p>夥計從旁同動務兵好言，「老鄉！你們的行李並不多，還是請你費點力罷，搬過去，我也來幫同拿東西！」</p>
<p>「那裏是我怕吃力不肯搬東西！太太不願意呀！咱們的太太本是很好說話的，但要搬到別個女人的房間裏去，她不肯了！」</p>
<p>他這些話說得非常誠懇，很是動人。我情願退出改搭別隻船了，可是，四面已經站滿了觀衆；大概為着營業的關係，帳房脹紅了臉，起勁的東也一句太太西也一句太太，好像非說妥不可，是勢成騎虎的了。</p>
<p>被人羣包圍着，在緊張的情景中，從這兩位太太，我聯想起來了家鄉鄰居的婦人，她們什麼事情都會得遷就，只是不肯搬到已經住上有着關係的婦人的房屋裏去；不但大太太不肯搬到姨太太所在的房屋裏去住，姨太太也是不願意到大太太裏去同住的；以為這是最大的恥辱，是寗死不苟且的。</p>
<p>我又聯想到了「有錢不住東西房」的話，從前有兩個朋友，是莫逆的了；同時結婚，打算同居，早就說得很好。但在同一所屋子裏的房間，總有着東西南北的分別；雙方的新娘子都不肯住東西房，弄得鬧意見，終於各自住開。單獨零租，仍然只有東西房；只是同房主本來沒有關係，無所謂相形見拙，所以不再計較。</p>
<p>不隨便搬到別個女人的房屋裏去，原是一般婦女所緊守的信條：到了輪船上面還是這個樣子，是本國婦女的特性，在本國的輪船上可以使得。所以搭了本國的輪船，看得到這種情形了。</p>
<h3>母子</h3>
<h3>十四歲</h3>
<p>— 子岡</p>
<p>「大叔，爸爸要我回去？」</p>
<p>小藍仰着那張兩頰紅得像黃錯天際的落霞的臉蛋，眸子裏充滿了懷疑地問着大叔。大叔是家裏的街坊，去去年小藍的爸爸甘託他送兒子到城裏來找買賣，現在却又託他順便寄信，呌兒子回去。</p>
<p>「今年鄉下人工貴，你爸爸想省一工長工錢，讓你帮忙，在城裏就是得守。」</p>
<p>「三年啊，老板說滿了三年就可以按月給我四五塊呢，而且在這小飯舖裏，吃是總吃到點油水的……」孩子戀着這獃了一年的小舖，他記得在家有幾天連菜葉也啃不到的日子，摸摸自己臉上的肉，好像全是以前所沒有的。</p>
<p>中年人的「大叔」像是不耐煩孩子的盤問似的：</p>
<p>「你爸爸等不及咧，當初是想忍一下，把你弄出去，好好地能站住脚跟，可是現在又忍不住了。今年鄉下的有勁兒的年壯夥子大半到城裏投奔來，人工越發地貴了哪……你，不是長得很結實了麼，抵得了大半工，至少。」</p>
<p>孩子伸伸自己的路臂，的確不細，也許是像了爸爸，老也長不高似的，粗粗的腰圍，，粗粗的手腿，看看這手腿，大約不久又要瘦下去，心裏有點痠：</p>
<p>「只剩滿年了，爸爸熬不過了麼？……」</p>
<p>「在這裏、你不單拿不到錢，却還要從家裏要新衣新鞋呀，你娘都把自已的新　褂改給你作大掛了。」</p>
<p>小藍這才驀地記起了媽媽，她比他爸爸希望他更來得殷切，曾在兒子决定了離家的前兩天，連夜給趕出兩套褲褂兩雙新鞋來，當她親手給小藍試擊一條新圍裙時，她眼角裏滲滿了淚水：</p>
<p>「好好做學徒啊，端碗拿碟子留點神，個子矮，眞是有點費力的，過兩年就好了。」</p>
<p>這話還在小藍耳朶邊轉，他知道當頭一眼媽媽瞧見自己穿了靑布圍裙活像一個在飯館裏被人呼來喚去的小徒弟時是多麼傷心，但幸好她還沒有到城裏來瞧過。他不能吿訴她——這世界裏最疼他的人——：他貧在冬天的狂風飛雪裏冒了寒冷，提着飯籃一條街一條街地送鈑菜，紅紫的手上砌了斑斑的血塊，送到了時還要受到人家的叱駡，什麼菜潑翻了，飯凉了……再加上掌櫃的遣責：偷懶，或是飯桶，這些，小藍全往社裏嚥，只記着「三年」，爸媽的叮囑是記得的，爸爸常撫摸了自己的腦袋：</p>
<p>「兒子比老子強，那是一定的……」</p>
<p>一年來，那條媽媽為它淌淚的圍裙也磨薄了，每次自已洗到它總想：</p>
<p>「快破了，該請媽再做條新的了，磨破三條，也就出頭了。」</p>
<p>想到這些，小　總是臉上印着笑。</p>
<p>但現在是淸淸楚楚的，大叔又要帶他回去了。</p>
<p>在長途汽車行前等着打票時，有一隻大汽車裏裝滿了興高彩烈的大批黃衣黃帽的孩子，嘴裏哩哩啦啦地唱着歌兒，小藍茫然地：</p>
<p>「大叔，那些孩子是唸書的嗎？」</p>
<p>「學生囉，春天啦，大約是逛山玩水去。」</p>
<p>對於大叔的能隨問便答小藍幷不感到驚奇，只感到這一羣孩子該是和自己相仿大小，而想：</p>
<p>「他們的爸媽不替他們發愁嗎，像小藍的爸媽一樣，一會兒把兒子推到城裏，一會兒又從城裏拉了回去？」</p>
<p>斷綫一樣的疑問在孩子心上盤據起來，看見那些孩子的車嘟嘟地開遠了後，小藍才：</p>
<p>「大叔，那些孩子多大啦？」</p>
<p>「十四五吧，好年紀哩！」</p>
<p>「哦，我是十四，和他們差不多呢——」</p>
<p>閃着睫毛，小藍有心無心地輕輕說着。</p>
<h3>第一個印象</h3>
<p>— 蘆焚</p>
<p>—大行追記—</p>
<p>（第一個印象往往是錯誤的，因為人類聰明，而我們又太自信了這聰明。）</p>
<p>夜已經深了。空氣陰寒浸人，充滿了沾沾的露氣。我被收進一座小屋子裏。屋狹小陰濕，有破舊的桌凳同床，墻頭白堊紛紛下落，泥地濡濕，似乎是黑色的，總之，牠雖沒有森林的雄茂，却同森林一樣憂鬱。這裏有濃厚的霉腐味，是從剝落的墻上和陰陪的角落裏發出來的。</p>
<p>『在什麼地方呢？』</p>
<p>這樣想着，我也與小屋一樣覺得憂鬱了。</p>
<p>但想不出在什麼地方。</p>
<p>我只知道小屋有兩個窗洞，因為糊着紙，並不通空氣。尋出一枝烟抽着，將小屋重新打量了一番，覺得又熟悉又生疏。原來我是從，門裏進來的，那兩扇用一寸厚的木板做成的門，油漆得很厚，發出使人不快的光，古老而又晦暗的光。那門在屋的一端開着，通向別一所房子。起初我覺得是落脚在一家客舍裏，然而天井裏沒有騾馬的呼喚聲，也聽不見什麼蹬蹄。</p>
<p>一蓋煤汕燈放在桌上，不斷的冒起烟子，火光很昏闇。我背燈坐着，望着地上的影子。影子搖幌着，在誘引我。不知什麼蹊蹺，一面顛着脚尖，一面想，從壑谷裏突然闖出人同馬來，手執火把，且高聲吶喊着……想得很遠，而且很多。</p>
<p>夜幽密的罩着這盆地，是那樣深。寺裏的鐘聲響了，平靜又古老，為什麼而呼喊似的，嘹亮而且洪壯的嗚聲越過山嶺，送到荒谷裏去。狗怯怯的吠嗥，因為空氣潮濕，顯得很遲鈍。在這樣地方，狗是時常被驚擾的罷。不知何時起，一個聲音在曠野上呼喊，那是不變的呌聲，也許是招引他失迷了的羊羣同孩子。那呼聲很寂寞的，像一隻孤單單的雁的影子，落到不可知的什麼地方去。因為是不斷的吆喝着，更像呼喊在幾世紀以前，現在古董似的無意間被發掘出來了。</p>
<p>我重新取出一枝烟來燃上，仍不動的坐着，在期待什麼似的。</p>
<p>雖不曾到過西班牙，但是已經想到西班牙了。</p>
<p>這第一個印象是否可靠呢？我走進沒有月亮的夜裏，去聽那曠野上的呼聲………</p>
<h3>巨卿先生（十五）</h3>
<p>— 柯靈</p>
<p>「咦，這老太公，鬼頭鬼腦的作啥」！</p>
<p>打戰鼓般話劇的心跳，不打理，若無其事地走著。不到兩三步，耳朶裏就聽得一個孩子忽然在人叢裏叫：</p>
<p>「啊呀，他是鵝市弄的私塾先生，捉住他！」</p>
<p>接着，大家立刻亂嘈嘈地嚷起來了。並且裝模作樣的捲着袖管，晃着小手臂。</p>
<p>「他來偷看學堂啊，捉住他！各住他」！</p>
<p>巨卿先生心跳得連呼吸也十分迫促，一股憤怒的火直冒上來，臉色鐵靑，一迴身猛的站住了，咬緊了牙關說：</p>
<p>「小鬼，你們最，你們」！</p>
<p>孩子們站着不敢再上前，你看看我，我看看你。</p>
<p>「小鬼，沒爹娘教訓的」！</p>
<p>恐怕還有教員在裏面，恨恨地駡了一聲，巨卿先生又顧自已走。他一走，七八僩學生又像出窠的蜜蜂似地跟住他，亂嘈嘈地叫着。</p>
<p>「不要逃，逃逃濫虫！」</p>
<p>「你這老不死，陰司秀才！」</p>
<p>「哈哈哈，濫虫，陰司秀才！」</p>
<p>一片雜亂的笑聲，叫駡聲，拍掌聲，混合在一起，一直鬧到校鬥外，看著巨卿先生沒有再反攻的意思，還追了一段路，纔呼嘯着打了勝仗似的回去了。</p>
<p>受着這樣的侮辱，巨卿先生是生平第一次。小孩子在他的面前，本來再强橫的也會變得像屠夫手下的羔羊，想不到今天却竟受了一班小孩子戲弄，奚落。他全身冰冷，頭腦昏昏沉沉，在街上跑着，他的步履是踉踉蹌蹌的。他想不到今天會受這意外的委屈。</p>

<h3>耶穌復活節賀電</h3>
<p>— 楨</p>
<p>——講求國際社交人士注意——</p>
<p>西洋習俗，每逢耶穌復活節及耶穌聖誕節，常用電報往來，問候親友，各國電局於此時期接收此項電報，日以千百計，工作異常忙碌。歐風東漸，西人僑華者日衆，耶節發寄電報者亦日多。六通部曾於二十一年十月二十四日公布國際賀年電報規則，准於耶穌誕日前後發寄國際賀電，收費僅總價三分之一，蓋國外交際電之一種也。</p>
<p>耶穌誕日前後，旣經開放賀電，而耶穌復活日前後，尙無减費規定，未免美中不足。交通部為發展國際電報起見，特規定自四月十五日起至二十二日止，開放國際耶穌復活節賀電。（Easter　Greeting　Telegram）茲探得通達地點及收費辦法如下：（一）通達地點，以經無綫電或水綫發往英，德，美，坎拿大，紐芬蘭，夏威夷，菲利濱，及經無綫電發往日本者為限。（二）每電以十字起碼，照尋常電每通銀元報費總價三分之一收費。（三）納費標識（Xet）作一字收費，其餘辦法，聞均與賀年電同云。</p>
<p>我國人土，凡講求國際社交者，不可不發寄此項電報。尤不可不介紹僑華西友，發寄此項電報。</p>
<h3>談談電話詢臺</h3>
<p>— 淸華</p>
<p>……純以服務民衆為目的……</p>
<p>……電話用戶可儘量利用……</p>
<p>近兩年來交通部對於電報電話業務，力謀改進，其所持之政策，完全以便利民衆為前提，蓋電報電話為國營交通事業，旣非純為貿利而創辦，對於民衆通信上之便利，自應儘量供給，俾民衆感覺服務週到‘而享受國營事業之利益。最近交部又令飭上海，天津，北平，武漢，首都，靑島，烟台，鎭江，吳縣，等九處電話局，自四月一日起，添設訽問台，除答復用戶詢問電話號碼外，兼任答復用戶詢問當地各種事務，除用長途電話或公用電話詢問者，應照章收取長途或另售話費外，普通市內用戶，均可隨時向訽問台詢問，並不收費，惟詢問事項，暫以下列各項為限：</p>
<p>（一）市內電話租費及長途電話通話地點及價目</p>
<p>（二）國內外電報通報地點及價目</p>
<p>（三）國內外郵件通達地點及寄費郵資</p>
<p>（四）郵電局每日營業時間</p>
<p>（五）標準時刻</p>
<p>（六）當日發生火警地點</p>
<p>（七）火車輪船及長途汽車開行時刻及價目</p>
<p>（八）各娛樂塲所當日節目及時問</p>
<p>關於詢問事項之範圍，因係初次創辦，籌備極為費事，故暫以上述八種為限，將來尙須逐漸擴充，務使民衆對於普通之疑問，均可藉電話詢問台而解决，無形中養成民衆利用電話之習慣，間接卽使電話業務更形發展，故此項詢問台之設，實一舉而兩得也！</p>
<p>惟記者有不能已於言者，交部此次添設電話詢問台，目的純為服務民衆，在創辦之初，對於用戶之詢問，容有答復未周，希望用戶方面以合作之精神，用書面通知電話局加以改善，切勿過於責難。同時希望電話局主管人員對於詢問範圍以內之必需查考文件，務求搜羅完備，並隨時注意更動，（最好與各有關機關事先商妥，遇有更動價目或時間時，立卽將價目表或時刻表送局，）以免答復錯誤，發生誤會。如有詢問台難以詳細答復之事項，應將辦理該項事務之機關公司或傷所之電話號碼吿知用戶，以便用戶直接向其詢問，至於詢問臺工作人員，尤盼態度謙和，應答周詳，使用戶感覺滿意，庶可增進話局之信譽也。</p>
<h3>改訂新聞報收費辦法</h3>
<p>— 松</p>
<p>我國新聞界與電信界同負建設中國文化使命，同為便利民衆與社會而服務，彼此應當嚴密合作，毫無疑義。顧近來一部份新聞報館，積欠報費頗多，經電局催促償還，尙有未實行者。或者謂此一部份新聞報館，利用「新聞政策」，以經濟不充足為理由，及國營事業可以記帳之心理，對於新聞電報費，常延不照付云云。作者認為上說，不獨誣蔑新聞界人格，且足以為新聞界電信界合作，而自塞其消息之源泉。作者於本刋三十三期「新聞界與報話欠費」一文中，業經闡明此義矣。</p>
<p>然則新聞報費何以積欠纍纍耶？考共主原，毋亦電局收費辦法不善，致愈積愈多，難以淸償之咎歟？試言其故：</p>
<p>交通部為便利新開界起見，對於新聞電報，向有收報人付費辦法。此法係由新聞記者請領執照時，在執照內註明報費由收報人付字樣，經交通部核准後，卽可持照向指定各電局發報，在電底附註欄內加註RTP標識，收報局卽憑以向收發人收費。是新聞記者持有此項執照，不必携帶重貲，而享受各處發報之權利，殊稱便利。但此項辦法，向由發報局於月終塡造報費淸單，寄交收報局向收報人收取報費，各發報局對於上項淸單，大都造寄遲延，以致收報局不能按月向收報人收取報費，日久積欠甚多，收報人往往藉口淸單遲送為詞，而延不付費，此新聞報費積欠之所由來也。</p>
<p>交通部有鑒於此，乃規定自本年四月一日起，所有收報人付費之新聞報費，改由收報局逐日依據來報底塡造淸單，月終結算淸楚後，至遲於次月五日以前，送交收報之新聞機關，向其收費。如淸單送交後，五日內尙不繳付者，應卽停止投送新聞來報，並呈報電政司轉飭發報局停止收受該家新聞電報，以免報費無着。自此項辦法實行之後，收報局不必根據發報局之淸單，而致延月不送，收報人不得藉口淸單之遲送，而致不付報費，誠整理新聞報費之良方也。新聞界與電信界合作之精神，將益趨密切矣。</p>
<h3>郵政電滙的優點</h3>
<p>— 中明</p>
<p>通常人們如匯寄緊急欵項，每委託銀行承辦，委託郵政儲金匯業局或兼辦儲匯業務的郵局辦理的，甚不多覯。推考其因，第一由於郵政儲匯局或郵政局承辦電匯事務，歷史未久，未為社會人士所周知；第二由於社會人士雖知郵局承辦電匯，而未悉其優點，所以業務尙不發達。關於郵政電匯業務，該怎樣宣傳推廣，與本文無關，不必贅述。我所要談的就是郵政電匯的幾個優點。</p>
<p>講到郵政電匯的優點不外乎是「經濟」與「便利」。委託郵局電匯疑項怎樣會經濟的呢？原來交通部為便利公衆服務社會起見，特規定儲匯局或郵政局所發電匯電報，每通在二十字以內者，祇收報費銀陸角，逾限每字加收銀元五分。諸位試想，這筆匯欵電報費要此銀行所收的便宜若干。記者曾有一友人因家有急需，由京委託某銀行電匯洋二百元至漢口，須付匯電電報費洋二元陸角。後來記者與他相遇，談及此事，他認為電匯所費太昂貴。記者便介紹郵政電匯的方法，某君便恍然大悟，且似乎有「相見恨晚」的意思。查某君家住在漢口會通路，我暗地裏替他估計，若使這筆欵子，委託當地郵政儲匯局匯寄，電文决不致超過二十字，那麼須付匯電費六角就够了。這個故事，最足以證明郵政電匯，對於匯欵人减輕負擔的一個例子了。其次，譬如各位有時要匯寄一筆緊急欵項，其數目並不大，而收欵人則期望甚切，各位當然可用電匯方法寄去。但鑒於銀行匯費太大，似乎非經濟之道，往往令人猶豫不决，坐失時機。現在交通部郵政儲匯局電匯，報費旣極便宜，而且迅速可靠，眞合乎經濟的原理了</p>
<p>郵政電匯另一優點，就是「便利」，各位諒均明瞭我國銀行尙未普遍設立，邊遠的地方，更不見有銀行的門面，所以銀行辦理電匯業務，祇及於幾處已設分行的大城市，給予公衆的便利，祇囿於一隅而已。至於郵政局則遍設全國各處，故內地民衆如欲匯寄急用欵項，可充分利用郵政電匯的辦法，委託當地郵局辦理。這是郵政電匯的又一優點。再次，自從郵電合設以來，凡是設立郵局的地方，都兼收電報，或是郵電兩局設立在一起，因此郵與電之間，都有密切完善的聯絡，郵局所發的郵匯電報，可以立卽就近交由電報局拍發，時間上卅續上要迅捷得多，這是郵政電匯的又一小優點。閱者諸位不妨試之，當知我言之不謬也。</p>
<h3>交通部對於廣播無綫電之政策</h3>
<p>— 雲</p>
<p>依照國民政府頒布的電信條例，民營廣播無綫電台的設置，須經交通部或其委託機關之核准，人民裝用無綫電收音機，須向交通部或其委託機關登記領照。關於上述事項，交通部均有徵收執照費及制定取締規則之權。所有交通部於民國二十年四月十日公布之「裝設廣播無綫電收音機登記暫行辦法」及民國二十一年十一月二十四日公布之「民營廣播無綫電台暫行取締現則一卽係依據上述電信條例賦予交部之特權所產生。</p>
<p>我人拿上面所講的收音機登記暫行辦法來研究，可以看出交通部對於人民裝用收音機這件事情是有意提倡的，因為他規定所有收音機登記的手績十分簡單，祇需向交通部或各處電報局索取登記聲請畫，依式塡明後卽可領取登記證。上項登記領蹬手績並不收費。但一面為防杜流弊起見，對於廣播爾台及收音機之管理却力求嚴密。例如設立廣播電台，祇准以中華民國之公民，完全華商之公司，國民政府立案之學校團體或其他合法組織為限。其非完全華商之公司及非完全華人國籍之團體，須經國民政府註冊頒有註冊蹬書者始得設立廣播電台。又人民裝用收音機，如不遵照部定辦法聲請登記及領取登記證者，一經查出，按照電信條例之規定除沒收其全副機器外，並酌最情形處以二千元以下之罰金。</p>
<p>再就事實來觀察，交通部以前對於廣播事務，似乎因為其他郵電航各政百端待理，無暇專顧，所以有些地方，稍稍放任。卽以上海一地之民營廣播電台數目而諭，竟逾五十處，其電力最大者僅五百瓦特，最小者僅十五瓦特（南京中央廣播電台之電力為七萬五千瓦特）以致週率紊亂音波煩雜，不獨使聽衆感覺不快，甚致有時影響國營無綫電台之重要通信。此雖一部分由於租界之特殊關係，但交通部如能盡力設法取締，當然尙有改善之可能。近一二年來，交通部對於各種事業努力整頓業已具有成績，於是漸有餘力注意於廣播無綫電問題。第一步先將外商設立之廣播電台交涉撤銷，其不願撤銷者，則出價將其收買，今春購買之北平增茂洋行電台及上海美靈敦公司電台（呼號Xqhc為上海外商開辦最早聲譽最著之廣播電台），卽其顯例。第二步鑒於消極取締之不足為最良政策，於是有全國廣播電台網之設計，而且决定於最短期間在上海成立一最新式大電力優美廣播電台，此誠全國無綫電聽衆之好消息也。</p>
<h3>規定收找報費零數辦法之意義</h3>
<p>— 葆眞</p>
<p>查現行國內電報價目，係按每字一角收費。國際電報則按法郎生丁計費，惟在中國境內均按金法郎兌換價率折合銀元收取。因此國際電報價目折合銀元後，每字應收報費數目，殊難凑成整數。且國內國際電報，除報費外，均常有附帶各費，如分抄費譯費校對費等，其數未必均係整數，故每電之報費總數，往往均有元」位以下之零數。我國幣制雖按十進計算，但「角」「分」輔幣，除京，津，滬，漢，平各大都市已有中央·中國·交通·中國農民等銀行之角票流行市面外，其他內地各處，尙未普遍通用大洋輔幣票，大都用小洋（卽雙毫銀角）銅元折合計算，均須貼水，而貼水行市，又復因時因地而異，殊不一致。且現在全國電報局已與郵局合設一處，或交互設置郵政支局及電報收發處，郵電局處對於銀錢兌換價率，亟應同樣辦理，以歸一律。否則此高彼低，殊易引起民衆誤會。交通部有鑒於此，業經規定收找報費零數辦法，通令各局遵照辦理，茲將該項辦法摘要分述於下：</p>
<p>（甲）流行大洋輔幣軍各地，電局對於報費零數之收入或找出，應照下列辦法：（一）電局找付不滿一元之零數，應盡量利用大洋輔幣票，不滿大洋一角之零數，並准用郵票代替。發報人繳付不滿一元之報費零數，最好能同樣辦理。例如報費及譯費總數為一元二角一分，發報人除繳銀元一元外，可付大洋輔幣票二角郵票一分，否則如以銀元二元要求電局找付餘數者，則電局應找付大洋輔幣票七角郵票九分。（二）不滿一元或一角之零數，發報人如不用大洋輔幣票或郵票繳付，而用小洋或銅元繳付，或用大祥輔幣票與小洋或銅元混合繳付者，其小洋或銅元折合大洋之價率，應照當地郵局親定之兌換價率辦理。（三）上述各地電局，為預謀充分準備大洋輔幣票，以便找付起見，應估計每月或每週所需大洋輔幣票數目，備欵向中央·中國·交通等銀行躉購大洋輔幣票，以資應用。</p>
<p>（乙）尙未流行大洋輔幣票各地，電局對於報費零數之收入或找出，應照下列辦法：（一）凡五角或五角以下之報費零數，應由發報人按照當地郵局公吿之兌換價率繳付輔幣（包括銅元銅元票及銀角角票等？）或用五分一分兩種郵票代替。否則如用銀元要求電局找付餘數者，電局得用五分一分兩種郵票找付之。（二）凡五角一分或五角一分以上之報費零數，得由發報人按照當地郵局公吿之兌換價率繳付輔幣（包括銀角角票銅元及銅元票等），或以銀元要求電局按照當地郵局公吿之兌換價率找付輔幣。上項第二項辦法，發報人不得以郵票繳付，如用銀元要求電局找付餘數者，除發報人自願收受郵票外，電局亦不得以郵票代替。</p>
<p>交通部規定收找報費零數辦法，不厭求詳，其意義不外（一）流行大洋輔幣票各地，報務較繁，收報員對於報費零數之收入或找出，均用大洋輔幣票及郵票，直接可以免去小洋銅元折合大洋計算貼水之煩，减少收費時間，間接可以增高遞電速率。（二）收報員不能故意抬高或壓低銀錢兌換價率，從中漁利。（三）劃一郵電兩局銀錢兌換價率。對於發報人確有相當便利也。</p>
<h3>電視論叢</h3>
<p>— 十郎</p>
<p>無綫電電視，為近年電學上最大之發明，歐美專家，正在埋頭研究，最近將來，可能開放營業。（德國現已開放）我國電信事業，久落人後，對於電視，安可不急起直追迎頭趕上乎？茲閱一月號華盛頓出版之無綫電月到，載有各電學專家討論電視問題文字，愛迻譯之，以供參考。</p>
<p>譯者識</p>
<p>電視由傳形研究而成　薩勞夫（Sarnotf）</p>
<p>余相信將來無綫電科學，必進而為傳形，傳形卽電視成功之路。自莫爾斯發明電報以來，電報學上尙無澈底之改革。英氏電符，多年已成國際上通用，但吾人現在電視，對於電報學術，將有莫大之進步也。吾人由空氣中拍發畫片印刷品等物，而用電鍵調節其通報。電文不需用點劃之續斷，乃用光綫「刷成」，依行繪就，然後再用閃光完成之。第一步傳遞圖片與刷印品，卽傳形無綫電，第二步傳遞活動影片，卽為電視。但事前須覓得一速的通信媒介，馬可尼發現一種顯微電波，係以太紫色光中之渺小電波，不受靜電及衰落之影響。研究電視，有助於傳形廣播，而傳形研究之所得，可為電視之推進。吾知其進程必甚速也。</p>
<p>電視在試騐室中　何根（V，L，Hogan）</p>
<p>在廣播無綫電許多新發明之時，公衆心理中起一種疑問：卽「今日為何尙無廣播電視之事業乎？」但事實上，現在已有電視電臺之運用，惟全在試騐中，而無正式節目開放於觀衆耳。以余度之，其無此項節目開放於廣播聽衆之前者，係由於無整個計劃以組成此種事業實質的要素。要素有三：（一）電視傳遞機，應有完善之保護物，（二）應具有興趣的節目材料，足資傳遞，（三）電視收受機，在合宜價目之下，須廣大的分給於用戶，且須放演極佳之影片，於業務上以滿足用戶之慾望，非徒引起好奇心而止也。</p>
<p>一九三五年之商用電視　福來斯（LeedeForest）</p>
<p>余甚相信一九三五年，可觀眞實的商用電視於室內，給吾人以二百行之黑白色影片，其大小為十八方吋至三方呎，且不需用陰極光。放演時閃光傳形，當亦同時實現於銀幕上。但放演可紀錄的形像於室內，有無商業上之利益，尙待討論。在工程可能方面，由任何三種證明方法言之，亳無疑義，不過經濟問題而已。</p>
<p>如何使電視趨於普及，必遇到許多先决問題，將來必須順利的以解决之也。</p>

<p>菲列濱　15.30-16.30及24.30-O2.30G．M．T</p>
<p>附註：每逢星期日，各處通話時間大多减短。</p>
<p>各關係通話處經商洽同意後，得隨時重訂營業通話時間。故上項時間表僅示現在之通話方法而已，不可視為永久不變者也。</p>
<p>每次通話以前，舊金山與夏威夷等三處電臺，須按預約之波長會晤。遇雙方中任何一方已在等候通話，如事實上可能，應卽行接通。俟通話完畢，各將發射機停止工作，惟收音機仍應維持調整狀態，以備隨時被呼喚時立卽會晤。</p>
<p>帮脫雷斯收音台，須在規定通話時間內，守聽外方各發射機發出之預約波長。且舊金山電臺被呼喚時，如狄克遜地方之發射機未與他臺通話者，卽應取用該機工作，否則須速將談話結束，俾與呼喚方通話。</p>

<p>美國敎育家孟祿博士，前日曾與客時論，彼所稱爲吾人新時代最有意義之運動，卽東方文化之出現與復興，據謂渠信中國在政治上文化上，尚未尋着自己，我對於來路貨戴方帽子的朋友，根本上談不到信仰，但是他前天所說吾國在政治上文化上尚未尋着自己這一句話，我却十分相信。</p>
<p>若說政治，我完全沒有政治常識，有沒有尋着自己，姑且按下不談，若所謂文化（不過也有一部分包括政治在內，）也有屬於物質的，也有屬於精神的，物質的文化，我也擱　不談，若論精神的文化，則一切文藝，美術，宗教，言語，習慣，倫理等等，多包括在內，故文化二字的定義，照梁任公先生所說，「人類心能所開積出來的有價値的共業，」便是文化。</p>
<p>談到文化，便有新舊兩種思想的不同，揚鑣分道，各走極端，例如談文藝者，新的則欲完全拋棄國學不用，而主張所謂大眾語，拉丁化等等，舊的則主張讀經，再來大談其「天命之爲性」「大學之道」等等，一則「看見鬍子便呌伯伯」，一則穿上紅袍紗帽，還大踱其方步，兩者的距離，便是呌孫行者來翻幾個斛斗，恐還是達不到哩。</p>
<p>再以女子方而言，新的不但赤足穿鞋，甚且主張裸體遊行，舊的幾欲重驅一般女婦女們，仍到房間裏去，讀她們的閨門訓女兒經，纏她們的三寸金蓮，守她們三從四德，這兩種完全衝突的思想，多是自己滿身毛病發覺的表現，就是孟祿博士所謂還沒有尋着自己，故孟祿博士說東方自始卽相信其自己文化的真實，但此文化必須加以修改，而使適用於新時代的世界，此語真是值得注意。</p>
<p>所謂尋着自己者，先要認識自己，要認識自己，先要具判斷新舊文化優劣的能力，自己固有的文化，不合於新時代者，去之惟恐不速，合於新時代者，保存之惟恐不暇，否則如扶醉漢，扶到東來西又側，但始終尋不着自己的廬山面目。</p>
<h3>鸕鶿船</h3>
<p>— 野菲</p>
<p>在胥口外，水東灘的塘岸上，鱗次櫛比的全是一列茅蓬屋，里面的居民，都是給天災人禍所壓迫而背井離鄉的飄流到這兒來結草爲廬的。他們的生活大都是靠捕魚爲生，做小販短工雖然也有，可却不多。</p>
<p>水東灘的風景本來不壞，三面靠山，一面朝水，一條漫長而又曲折的堤岸，　蜓着躺在太湖之尖。岸的兩傍植着緊密的楊柳桃樹，左邊有小橋荷蕩,右面全是一大片廬葦，荷蕩上首就是一塊梅林</p>
<p>堤的盡頭，有十多艘小船停泊着，每只船上都躱着三二十只鸕鶿船，有的伸長了　子在望天，有的把嘴巴插進翅膀里去修羽毛，也有的縮着頭頸蹲在踏竿上休息。</p>
<p>傍晚，船主人捧了一盆水豆腐來，牠們一搶　呑了下去；並且還像沒有吃飽似的，拍着翅膀，向牠們的主人，噪嚷不住。</p>
<p>每天當東方　現出一些魚肚白，胥口鎭上才送過敲五更的鐵榜聲，而他們這裡的許多水老鴉－鸕鶿－船，便一艘一艘的向山渚頭一帶移去。天空中漸漸地發起亮來，山灘上的樹林，在微光中隱約可以辨出一些模糊的影子，而一顆顆的星子都偷偷地溜了；這灰暗色的文天幔也彷彿將要撕裂似的。</p>
<p>一艘一艘的小船在這廣闊的湖面上飄着，每到一個地方，船主人只須將篙子輕輕一略，那站在兩傍船舷上的鸕鶿便噼　噗　的翻到水裏去了。等到那艘小船在湖面上　漾了一個丈餘的圈子，這些鸕鶿却又一隻一隻的跳到了船舷上來，有的嘴裏却啣著一條魚，也有仍舊空著嘴巴的；主人把魚擠了下來，照例又該給一頓豆腐她們吃，吃了以後，讓牠們休息一回，再換一個地方趕牠們到水底裏去捕魚。</p>
<p>那十多艘水老鴉船中，要算阿順叔的年齡最長，就是那艘木板的小船也正像他的年齡一樣久遠而比別艘破舊了；同時也為了他吃這門飯的歷史最悠久，所以他的經驗也比別人豐富。他不但能預知天晴天陰，風大風小，並且還能够預占到那一個地方魚多魚少；為了這樣，因此同行中就送了他許多綽號，什麼「水眼」咧，「魚神」咧！</p>
<p>阿順一來在故鄉就吃這行飯的；自從五年前大水把他的家冲去了以後，他就跟着一羣被難者飄流到這裏來了。他現在是一個孤獨的老人，原先他家里也有個獨生兒子的，計算起來，如今也該有三十三歲了；可是不幸得很，他在十年前就別了他而去世了！他的老婆也爲了想念兒子過度而一病不起，於是他便成了個孤獨者，而且更爲了天災的原故，又流浪到了這異鄉。</p>
<p>到這裏來的一共有二三十個人家，都自家搭起茅蓬屋來住着，有些人家在先前並不經營捕魚的，爲了生活問題，所以現在也來做這門行業了。不過他們大都有一個茅蓬屋的家，而阿順叔却除了一艘破小船，和二十隻禿頭的水老鴉相依爲命之外，一切都沒有的了。然而，這些在他，倒也好像並不曾想到，他只知每天捕了魚來換米換酒，酒是他的第二生命，一天二十四小時，至少有五六小時覺醒在醉鄉中的；他就在這醉鄉中輕輕地把這寂寞的歲月葬送……</p>
<h3>便宜的糧食是有的</h3>
<p>— 愚言</p>
<h3>樊籠小唱（下）</h3>
<p>— 秦鑒</p>
<p>我感到了一次沈鬱的懷疑與壓抑。</p>
<p>也許給從大自然的原野裏給抓來的時候，捕獵者是曾用了金絲籠的富麗之輝煌與精米的蛋黃米來誘惑過她們的，也許又用了黑銅的快槍又加上了權威的獰猙的笑來威迫過她們的，而更或許，則在狡計與欺騙中，設起了活絡的阱陷來賺過她們的。於是：也許在餓荒了肚子的時候，發一發狠大着胆子去啄取活籠面前的榖粒了，縱然知道是危險的，可是爲了活，還有誰能顧得到呢？而更有的，則在槍口與烟幕中失去了力，於是，接着便伸過了一隻大而堅硬的手，殘酷的，不可動搖的，於是，一下子便把她們緊緊地抓住，又一下子便無可避免的把她們送進了滿佈著柵條的樊籠，</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>要她們永遠地在那見唱着，唱着。</p>
<p>然而，唱的是不快意的樊籠中的怒號，但是這怒號是留着給快樂的，永遠沒有憂愁，沒有悲苦的人們所神往，所欣賞的啊！</p>
<p>悲哭了，憤怒了，狂呼了；可是滿佈在柵條外面的却全是一些侮辱的，恥笑的眼睛：「安靜吧，小東西，得扮得可愛一點，讓我們快樂起來——這，是你底本分，也是命定了的，不可搖動的你底永久的命運啊！」</p>
<p>是眞的嗎？不錯，也許眞是這些美麗的小動物之「永久的」（都可怕啊！）命運吧？人把她們從自由的天地攫取過來無理由地放進樊籠；在那兒，在人們的不經意的玩弄中，靑春消逝了，褐色的暮年在眼前閃耀了，而最後，身體失掉豐滿，羽毛失掉了光采，嗓音失掉了圓潤，於是，在人們的縐眉與厭惡中，帶着抑鬱，帶着永不消滅的對自由的懷念，便那把無聲息地死去了，在樊籠裏，在冷漠中。</p>
<p>也許是永遠在懷念着偉大的自由之天地中的一枝小草，一滴泉水吧？也許朝朝暮暮毫無間歇地在唱着苦楚的樊籠裏面的小唱吧？但主要的是應當使自己準備起來，堅强起來啊！</p>
<p>在不斷的努力中——</p>
<p>嘴是有一天會尖銳起來的，聲音是有一天會强大起來的，樊籠的柵條是有一天會崩圯的！</p>
<h3>失眠</h3>
<p>— 燕</p>
<p>幾晚沒有好睡，自己又沒有患失眠症的經騐，故不敢輕於吞服安眠藥片之類。經友人介紹我一個從德國歸來的內科專家，於是不必經過掛號等手續而直接踏進那間純粹白色為主體的診察室了。我先授上友人的名片，寒喧之後他開始詢問我病狀，諸如飲食，起居，大便，工作等，甚為詳盡，但是情形都和平當人無異。那個從德國歸來的DR，就在狹小的診察室裏散步起來，右手的食指和大拇指壓在　下不住地磨察他用保安力刮硬了的　根，不時遺很近視眼鏡的邊綠向我作偵探式的巡視，他大概懷疑我有什麼病狀故意隱藏着似的。最後他停止了徘徊，用手指敲着玻璃台，很有禮貌地要求檢騐我的肺部，我自然不能拒絕他的診斷，而且他是那般鄭重地考慮着我的病源，我亳無遲疑地解散我的衣服。但是他立卽阻止我，那樣急促地喊了起來：「受冷！受冷！」一面吩咐助手進內室開電火爐，同時招呼我進去。利用這一段空間，他吿訴我中國人太不注意咳嗽感胃，以為是無足輕重的小病，其實許多不治之症都種因於此的。而且，」他加强着說：「卽是一切飲食起居，都是太馬虎，所以往往有種莫明其妙的病狀發生！」不知他故意注意着我，我面上漸漸地發熱起來：幸而他診察我的肺部了，胸前，背後，經過了很久時間，又右手的食指和大拇指壓着顏下和我出內室。隔着玻璃台坐定了，不待我啓問，他細聲說了：「很奇怪，一點沒有病狀！——偶或這幾天不能好睡，不是病！——沒有關係的！」用派克墨水筆潦草的開了一味藥。問他，是安眠藥片。</p>
<p>醫士特別客氣，送到診察室門口和我握手道別，最後忠吿我：「晚上早些睡，不要胡思亂想！」</p>
<p>門外，春天的太陽像一頭沒有覊絆的野馬滿街撤着，軟軟的輕風挾着一股不知名的香味撲近鼻官來。彷彿一個被裁判的囚徒突然解放，我深長地吸了一口氣，兩脚不自知地走進了公園。那天不是星期，公園裏沒有遊戲傷一般的熱鬧，我在小河畔找到了一只鐵梳化，遊目四望蘢葱的花木，精神異常興奮，這决不是一個患失眠症者應有的現像。「是的，沒有病！」我牢記着醫士的話。</p>
<p>歸家後，我從書架上搜出一冊衛生常識，翻到安睡部，是：晚餐不宜過飽，睡前禁飲茶吸烟及含有刺激性的飲食，若咖啡等，禁閱書籍；臨睡滌足………我預防失眠起見，一一照辦了。—這對於我誠然是種反常舉動，抽烟，飲龍井茶，已成了習慣而上癮，臨睡也總翻幾頁書才能合上眼的。—熄燈安睡，並且警吿自己不要胡亂思想，果然，很甜蜜地睡熟了。—</p>
<p>午夜賈食擔喊聲起的時候，醒來再不能入睡，望着玻璃窗上發現肚白色而漸漸光明又是好多天了。</p>
<p>「不是病！沒有關係！」我時常默唸着醫士的話，遲疑莫决？</p>
<h3>雨窗小柬</h3>
<p>— 鵬</p>
<p>×兄，春悄悄地來，悄悄地老了。去年桃花怒放的時侯，我們曾偷閑到鎭江，那晚從紫竹林歸來、，我忽然咳嗽得很利害，那是在鎭江最後的一個晚上了，就鼓着興緻上寳塔林去記得嗎？我們還鬧了年輕人的笑話呢。但是今年—據齊華歸來的朋友說，桃花已經凋落殆盡了！每天在數字中求麵包，簡直不知有春，有夏！然而你說光陰過得太快呢；有時倒不盡然：想想我們像一頭乳燕似的飛翔在海闊天空的時侯，幾乎是前一個世紀的事了。最近你失業了，或者更要覺得光陰跑得太慢呢：是不？這又使我憶起悠遠的故事？從前彷彿從不想到我職業這回事，而我們的生活反是優閑自然呢！那黃金時代的夢啊！現在是到了未老先衰的中年了！獨坐在窗前，聽出雨浙瀝地打着玻璃窗，往往會私自流下情淚。是的，我太儒弱了；然而你有勇氣向迷茫底一片前程抱什麼偉大的希望嗎？啊，恕我，說了不應說的話了。</p>
<p>上星期和鶴在南京路新雅啜茗，記着，我並不是套上高跟鞋學雅，偶然在電話中談到無聊，就想到這比較不化錢的塲合。那天我們兩個說了許多話，現在可記不起我們發了些什麼瘋！如果我們大聲喊起來的時候，恐怕眞要求我於瘋人院了。那末，你書可以一笑置之，或許你彷彿在我們隔座似的什麼都明白了。不過鶴吿訴我你最近閉門讀書，我就沒有你那般底好性子，自然我沒有禁止你讀書的意思。這要，我很抱歉，十分鐘步行可以到達你的家，我們甚至數星期沒有會面了，鶴的話或許失了眞相，你决不致捧起書本來學憨子的。我們自幼相處，知道你不是書本所能束縛的。然而—我希望你眞的趣了，世界上是缺少像我們這一類的憨子呢！</p>
<p>未知近來你與鶴會面沒有？我又負上了家的桎梏呢：淸明，上爸爸墳上去，歸來天色垂晚，未及搭車返滬，在那陰濕的房中過了一夜不必說，未料愈變愈壞的事情就發生在那晚呢？一切的往事，你至少明白了最重要的幾點：大家這制度不適於今日是無可諱言的，而我的家庭的複雜，更是一想家了就覺得寒心。在四年前的春天，凑足了一張三等車票的錢逃到上海來，有直起大拇指說我「勇氣」的，那毋寗說是一種「壓迫」吧！然而我忘不了將成一堆土丘的爸爸底墳墓，終於再投進了這所謂我的家！那故事說起來太長，如果記得我們燈下讀武者小路篤的「母與子」的時侯，那我們下次見面的時候可以不必去談起這惱人的事了。</p>
<p>現在窗外又下着絲絲的雨片，鄰家的門環響起來的時候，我定以為有人來訪我呢：因為從前我們被上雨衣去訪友的時侯很多的，而今這些朋友呢？好罷，你在南窗下高聲朗誦的時侯，大概每次投着希望的目光去瞧瞧那饗起了門環的大門吧，在你一個偶然疏忽的當兒，我將要亳無聲息地竚立在你面前了，或許球是現在。</p>
<h3>柔佛紀遊</h3>
<p>— 胡思衷</p>
<p>同友人乘着一輛汽車在獅島的海濱兜風，明突然主張到柔佛觀光去。雖然時候已經傍晚了，然而對於這個蘇丹王國的嚮往，卻驟然間鼓起了大家的興趣</p>
<p>「去吧！」</p>
<p>於是汽車便從熱鬧的街市漸漸轉入荒野的郊外。許多建築物漸漸隱沒了，接着來的却是廣大的椰林，間雜着草屋子。柏油道上滾起了迅捷的膠輪，道路是通行無阻。最初汽車還會碰着別的客人，越來却越是稀疏。一直到重再轉到馬來半島去的大道上，車子才再度多起來。待接近着柔佛鐵橋，已經可以看到暮　里的電燈光亮了。</p>
<p>從橋的這端一直望向前去，鐵橋筆直地躺在眼前。柔佛海峽的海水顯出蔚藍，浪花向橋柱上碰擊。明亮的電燈光排成直綫，在鐵橋上懸掛着，閃在眼裏異常爽目，剛剛有一列火車從橋上爬過，轟轟聲在駕在海上的空間更覺震耳。成行的兩道汽車綫更不住地連串馳行，兩隻巨大的眼珠子直照在傍晚赤道的空氣中。我們的車一跟這爬行隊在橋上穿道，熟帶傍晚的夜風便拂拂地從車間吻過，使我們覺到異常的凉爽，把日間的悶熱解除個淨盡。從這大海的空隙，海風的吹來更會使人從熱帶的困頓中淸醒起來。（未完）</p>

<p>梅花雖不是花王。品格淸高出衆芳。自古詩人曾品定。花魁名譽世無雙。那菊是花中之隱逸。蓮稱君子亦相當。周子愛蓮陶愛菊。兩人志趣並非常。不知道梅是隱逸兼君子。性淑品高貌亦莊。人世多稱桃李好。桃花艷冶李花香。那梅花。只安常。不願時髦學新妝。絕世風流無俗氣。羞與桃李鬥芬芳。無良媒。亦何傷。藐姑仙子本無郎。山中好友松與竹。夜半淸風月與霜。那凡卉只宜聽號令。誰能够先與占春光。所以說。新月舒眉衆星耀。老梅開口百花忙。天荒地老誰知己。只道人間目盡盲。却不料。多情還有林和靖。知音要說孟襄陽。而今國花推定更榮光。</p>

<h3>「不吻女子」的結婚愛佛玲温耐寳的自白</h3>
<p>— 馥</p>
<p>愛佛玲溫耐寳（Evelyn　Venable）是好萊塢後起諸女星之中，最美麗的一個。她和琪恩派克(Jean　Parker)一樣，有純潔無邪之稱。一個靑年女子，能得到這樣受人崇敬的，純潔無邪的稱譽，却是難能可貴，而大有帮助於她們的前途的。居然現在愛佛玲溫耐實和琪恩派克，都己成了後起之秀了。在這一點上，我們可以想到，一個靑年的女演員要想以「風騷」和「浪漫」來號召，非但是不值得，並且是叫人家看不起她，而促成她的失敗。</p>
<p>愛佛玲溫耐寳在影片中，並且有一個「不受吻」的傳說。但那當然是一種製片商人的宣傳作用，並不是她眞的吻不得的。你想，在表演之中給人一吻，算得了什麼？而一定要堅持不吻的主張，並且有人說，她的合同裏有一個條件，是不和男演員接吻的。愛佛玲說。然不便出來聲明，我是肯和男演員接吻的，但是我直到現在，想起來就要笑的。</p>
<p>「你想，多少年以來，美滿的結局，將女主角送到男主角的懷裏，輕憐密愛的溫存著，已經成了製片者不可剝奪的公權。好萊塢的所以為好萊塢，以及觀衆之所以喜歡看愛情影片，亦就是為這一點點了。誰敢，誰肯去剝奪製片者這種權利呢？當然不是我」。</p>
<p>以上是愛佛玲溫耐寳的自白，關於這「不吻」的一點的，但是她所要自白的，還不止這一點。原來她非但並不是不吻的女子，她並且是一個深解愛情的少女，因為她現在已經由愛情而結了婚了。她和她的丈夫的羅曼斯，已經進行了一年之久，直到現在她自已說出來了，外間才知道底細。這不應該請她自白一下子嗎？以下就是愛佛玲自白的話：</p>
<p>「好萊塢是不可救藥的羅曼諦克，並且是處處顯著重於情感的。她像一個好管閒事的老太婆，有些涉到情感的事發生了，她就要尋根問底的探聽一下。她的這種好奇心，是弊多而和少的。它破壞了多少好姻緣。因此，我們决定了將我的訂婚，要暫守秘密。我有多少次要講出來，但是我又不敢。這理由是很明顯的。我對於好萊塢宣傳政策的經驗，使我不敢啓齒起來。</p>
<p>「我知道大衆化了錢］去看一位演員所做的戲，他們應當有知道他或她的一切的權利，不然我亦不用吿訴你們了。但是大衆所要知道的，一定要準確。我親眼看見了不準確的新興，和不準確的批評，在一位電影演員身上的影響。因此，我就决意將我們的婚事，暫守秘密。</p>
<p>「如果你知道了某地方埋藏了一百萬元的珍寶，你該怎樣的謹守秘密？你不是要覺得吿訴人家，是件極危險不可靠的事嗎？你不要時時刻刻，提心吊胆，恐怕人家知道了，搶了去嗎？同樣的，我得到了百萬的寳藏。</p>
<p>「這是我第一次的將我的秘密宣佈出來，在過去一年之中，我們裝扮著，掩飾著；用盡了各種的方法，避開一切人的耳目，惟恐人家知道了我的寳藏，而被人搶了去。實在是因為好萊塢的好奇心和宣傳政策，太離奇可怕了。至於我們的羅曼斯，是這樣閒始的。</p>
<p>「那是我做了自由演員後，在福斯公司拍片子的第一天。我到了攝影塲上，看見開末拉後面的一個人。我的心立即被他攝引了去。我問了別人，才知道他是好萊塢名攝影師之一，哈耳穆爾。到了明天，我一到攝影塲就去尋他。我自己吿訴自己，我已尋到了一個我所要嫁的人了。第一次見了面，就覺得要嫁給他，那似乎是不可信的。但是我確知道我的心已屬於他了。很奇怪的，哈耳亦有同樣的感觸。後來地吿訴我，當他在鏡頭裏看見我的時候，他凝神看著，他就自己和自己說，那幅圖畫他頭意永遠地寳藏着。過了一個星期，我們就訂了婚了。</p>
<p>「這件事發生得這樣迅速，所以外間一些都不知道。我們就樂得隱瞞起來。幷且，我那時的意志雖然是很堅决，但是我還不能深信我個人的情惑。或者將來我們不能成為夫婦呢。因此，我們都覺得一年的猶豫期間是應當有的。如果到了一年之後，我們的情感絲亳不變，那我們的將來就更覺得穩固了。</p>
<p>「果然過了一年遮遮掩掩的生活，躱避着新聞記者好奇的目光，不敢公開的表示我們的情愛。但是一年過去之後，我們就坐了飛機，到一個地方結了婚。那是都末美滿的一天呀！現在我們　管在大衆面前握着手，或是擁抱着接吻。什麼都不用害怕了。」</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「巨舟迷陣」</h3>
<p>— 華倫</p>
<p>The　Captain　Hates　The　Sea　—大上海</p>
<p>「巨舟迷陣」是把人物，事件集中於一雙航行在大海中的輪船上，讓各個不同性格的演員，競技地各自顯一下身手的。在編劇形式與11AStar之號召方面，和以火車作背景的「羅馬快車」，及用旅館作背景的「大飯店」很有些相似。但是從演出的總成果上看，雖然比之「羅馬快車」較之生動，明快，然而距離「大飯店」之嚴密的結搆，深沉的刻劃，簡明的叙述，以及潑刺的演出似乎尙遠哩。</p>
<p>在船長海爾寬的指揮下，巨輪桑卡派獨號漸漸地離開遜彼特洛港而向他所紙惡的海開去。海爾寬船長的厭惡海，乃是有其理由的，他不是討厭那些悲歡離合的人情世態，而是怕看見那些在程中不斷發現而使他頭痛的人物與事故。</p>
<p>所謂這些人物自然是他旅客單上的高貴客人們。其中失意於好萊塢的著作家；有手段高妙的大盜和他的漂亮女助手；有進踪着他們的大偵探；有反目了的夫婦；有風流豪華的富孀；以及患着神經病的老旅客等各色人物。自然，我們這位船長也不免要被捲了進去做個配角的。</p>
<p>由這些人物上，展開來的情節，自然是戀愛糾紛與偵探案件交織的老套頭。跟着這些而來的結束，自然不免也是些老調：「有情人都成眷屬」。上船時的單身者或失和人，旅程中的糾纏者或不歡客，上岸時大都是各得其所的獲得了新歡舊愛，成雙配對擁抱地去了。至於偵探件當然也是順利地迎刃而解了的。</p>
<p>關於這類空虛平凡，庸俗無謂之內容的故事，我們曾經指摘過不少，這兒用不着再來多說什麼。而且這「巨舟迷陣」，總算是以新的結搆出現的，那末我們就討論一下關於結搆方面吧。</p>
<p>老實說，這劇本的結搆是並不怎樣高明的。作者所以强拉出的這批人物來，除了凑着演員而各給以戲做之外，似乎沒有其他企圖的。因此，他也就不能藝術的地把所提出的人物作更好的聯系。劇中除了偵探案中的三人有了戀愛的把戲作為進行之外，失意的著作家，風流富寡婦等人物中間是沒有合理的情節發展來關接着的。只是硬生生地以不和睦的夫婦之吵嘴和女的自殺來作波瀾，重複地以幾次聚餐來作主要的橫面總匯綫。因此，在枯燥與沉悶的空氣中，不得不借用老旅客的可突的習慣來作風趣的噱頭。由於這沒有內容的結搆，可是又不得不强調地給各個明星以多量的演戲機會，於是這不深沉的刻劃，倒眞成為一個迷陣了。</p>
<p>講到演技，個別地來看時，這些能做戲的演員，自然都有相當的成就。這見有麥克勞倫的偵探，佛萊特寇丁的大盜，海綸文生的女盜，愛立孫與溫妮的失睦夫婦等。可是由全劇整個地來看時，他們都有吃力不討好之感。比較地以演船長的華脫孔諾萊給人的印象最深，演着作家的約翰吉爾勃却沒有似他在別的戲中那樣的發揮。</p>
<p>導演魯意土曼爾司東雖然不像「西綫無戰事」那樣的成續卓着，然而却是很努力了的。</p>
<h3>母愛乎？性愛乎？「春風秋雨」集錦</h3>
<p>— 雲水</p>
<p>大導演之秘密據世界大導演之席的約翰史達爾氏（JohnM,Slahl），他的成名秘密依他自己所供，是在於宣露女性們的秘密。他常常說，假使你我有什麼秘密，人家都不大樂聞。但倘若那種秘密是屬於異性的，那末人們，定要爭先恐後的探聽了。其次能够抓住人們情感的為「永久的三角」了（EternalTriangle）。說三角不必一定關係戀愛的，醫如你我爭奪一匹馬，一把扇子，或一杯咖啡（那當然不常發生的）就可以呌做「三角」。再者好的戲劇最重要之成份，是自然的表演。倘使演員表演被觀衆瞧得出他們和她們在演戲，那末失敗已經在眼前了。</p>
<p>攝製「春風秋雨」的費用，達百萬金元之鉅。可是觀衆們還可以在該片內學到「一字萬金」的秘袂。</p>
<p>魚類學　魚類學Ichthyology是怪新鮮的名詞。這類學者在中國恐怕尙未誕生吧。可是在「春風秋雨」中，他還是情傷驕子博得母女的芳心呢。</p>
<p>童星聯璧　在「春風秋雨」拍攝時，最困難的是在童星的選擇，要面貌，態度，語音維妙維肖。雖經過時間的變遷還能依稀可以辯識，豈不是一個神怪的異蹟。終於三歲時琪茜（寡婦之女）得那位貝貝琪恩充任，九歲時琪茜由曼琳諾爾登（曾飾「塊肉餘生」中愛尼絲）擔任，十八歲後為露吉兒赫遜。苞蘭（黒婦之女）四歲時由茜貝亨利克，十歲之苞蘭為陶樂賽勃勒克，十九歲後為佛蘭華興登了。可是教練她們對白動作都非易事。</p>
<p>其他還有許多話想說，但是究竟適可而止為妙。</p>

<h3>小牧師（Little　Minister）（一）</h3>
<p>— 志</p>
<p>美國雷電華公司出品凱絲琳赫本主演</p>
<p>巴白娜又再從古堡裏跑到嘉定林來了。她急促地跑過了凌多爾的花園。因為她不要那些僕人們看見她，尤其是那個公爵的妹子——目光如電的伊連娜。她不想到巴白娜又會走出來的。</p>
<p>巴白娜的不覊舉動，全國古堡裏的人都厭煩她。可是她知道自己是一個被人遺棄了的吉普西女子，沒有一些的親屬，不能怪人家不滿的。凌多爾公爵從小就把她撫養起來。伊蓮娜看待她像姊妹一般，使得她來服侍公爵。巴白娜長大了，並且是很美麗的。公爵便立意娶她作妻子。</p>
<p>自從公爵有意娶白娜之後，伊蓮娜就看管得她更嚴了。恐防她那吉普西的性格流露了出來。就是將現在的情形看起來，她的行動已經不容於十九世紀的蘇格蘭了。她不僅是常常的單獨跑出來，並且把一位公爵的未婚妻所應穿的衣服不穿，却穿上那五顏六色的吉普西衣裳。</p>
<p>對於和公爵成婚的問題，起初巴白娜是不大注意到。可是時間一日一日的過去，她就懷疑起來了。她是否應該結婚呢？公爵對她雖然是很好，但是他的年幾至少却比她大得上一倍。</p>
<p>雖然是在正午，太陽高高的大空裏。可是那冲天的老樹，却把那嘉定林蔭蔽得像在夜裏一樣的陰暗。和別的地方完全兩樣，那裏靜寂到沒有一點聲音。祇有一些吱吱的鳥聲，或者是徵風來了，吹着落葉的沙沙聲。所以巴白娜時常都覺得這裏像無人跡的荒野一般可愛。一剎那間，已白娜不樂的，情又過去了。她快樂地一面跑着，一面唱着悅耳的歌。有特俯身下去擲一兩朶野花，有時看著那些跑來跑去的松鼠。她欣賞自然的快樂，忽的給一些沈重的聲音擾亂了。她聽見了一種沈重的聲音說：「女人」。她不認得是誰的聲音，但她一回過頭去，就知道是森林村阿特力脫教堂新來的牧師說的了。這村裏沒有別人穿這種衣服的，並且她聽見人家說他是「小牧師」。眞的，他是小，雖然他是裝着老成持重的樣子，但是仍然掩不着他的年靑。巴白娜因為穿着吉普西的衣裳，她就裝了吉普西女子的模樣，天眞活潑地將一雙眼睛望着他。聽着他說：「今日安息日給你的歌破壞了。你看見過警局的吿示嗎？吉普西人是不准在這塊地方的。她說：「我不識字的」。小牧帥弄得沒有法想，就把樹上姑着的吿示讀着道：「為警吿侵入境內者…」可是她靜靜的跑開了。小牧師轉過頭來巳不見了她　原來她小鹿般的跑回古堡云了。她現在才記起今晚公爵宴請何利爾隊長。她就得快些回去打扮起來。（未完）</p>

<h3>工廠建築的心理設計</h3>
<p>— 伯寗</p>
<p>一座工廠的建築，影響工人的健康，影響工入的精神，影響工人的工作效率，都是很大的。如果建築合適，工人們在廠裏，身體很健全，精神很愉快，工作的效率增得很高。否則，工人們有的患着「工作病」，有的精神萎頓，有的工作乏味，非但工人受苦，廠主方面，也受害匪鮮。</p>
<p>因為這問題是如此嚴重，所。在工廠建築中，不可不鄭重地顧到幾個最基本的心理條件：</p>
<p>（一）廠址的選擇　廠址的選擇最先願到的，當然是；地價，交通，人工等等。但這是經濟方面的條件，心理方面所應當注意的：</p>
<p>一，須離開開馬路，鐵路，及其他嘈雜環境較遠：我們時常看見一些臨近馬路的小工廠，每逢人家出喪，結婚，儀仗經過的時候，在那小小的窗洞中，常常探出工人烏黑的頭來。較大的工廠，監工較嚴，工人們不敢肆無忌憚，離了工作，儘自去欣賞。但是，一陣陣的鼓樂送進這般工人的耳中，雖然他們的手仍在工作，他們的心已是「一心若鴻鵠將至」，工作的效能也不堪問了。如果廠的旁邊有鐵道，火車尖銳的呌喊，車軌軋軋的聲音，日夜來往着，將阻礙多少工人的注意呢？因為選擇廠址，在可能範圍以內，最好不要臨近馬路，幷且和鐵道及其他嘈雜區也隔遠一些。</p>
<p>二，地點須高爽，環境須淸潔：廠房的基地過分卑涇，非但建築的基礙不很穩固，機件容易損壞。工人們常常罹病。情緒生活也十分惡劣，脾氣變壞，容易發怒，性子憂鬱，非但工作效率减低，而且不好管理，常常發生糾紛，馴至釀成風潮。在廠房附近如有不潔的場地，經日光的薰蒸，發生難堪的臭味，也能影響工人的能力。</p>
<p>（二）打樣須知　廠房的樣子，祇少顧到下列二點：</p>
<p>一，工場的大小，和工場間的距離：工場的地位如果太小，工人和機械就過分擁擠，非但空氣不易調節，而且這一種擁擠的環境，使工人的心理十分煩燥，馴至厭棄工作，工作效率會因之大損。但是工場又不能太大，太大了非但建築不經濟，而且工人的注意力容易散漫，不十分的集中。（未完）</p>
<h3>建築材料學</h3>
<p>— 朱枕木</p>
<p>（十）</p>
<p>第六章　銅</p>
<p>第一節　銅之槪述</p>
<p>銅礦多產於日本，智利，墨西哥，菲洲等地，而歐洲各國亦多出產。其礦砂以純銅礦出者亦有，卽有與他物合者，亦均有百分之九十銅量以上，故銅礦乃極易採鍊者也。</p>
<p>此章所述之銅，為赤銅，而非黃銅白銅，蓋黃銅白銅為合金，當容待後文中另述也。</p>
<p>第二節　銅之鍊製</p>
<p>銅之鍊製，其方法可分為淘砂，燒練，鎔解，銅化，凈練之五步：</p>
<p>（一）淘砂——淘砂一步，並非必要，惟凡遇銅質之含量稀少者，須用此步，其淘砂之法，原理為輕清渚上浮，而重濁者下沉，別無他故。其法可復分下列三步：</p>
<p>第一步　油浸——以礦砂研成細末，而投入含有煤油百分之一之水溶液中，使砂粒外粘油膜。</p>
<p>第二步　漂浮——卽以上浸砂液，傾入較大之水箱中，用方攪拌，使輕淸者上浮，重濁者下沉。</p>
<p>第三步　撇浮——輕者既經浮起，以其無用於斯，可撇去之，於是乃得純礦於桶底。</p>
<p>（三）燒鍊——燒鍊卽將礦砂用火直接燃燒之意，藉之除去礦砂中所含易於氣化之各物質，如砒　等是。同時燒鍊可以礦砂中所含硫璜質，氧化去四分之三，此種氧氣，可由所雜鐵礦中化出，同時鐵礦亦與硫合成硫化鐵，故燒練之後，已可得純銅若干。</p>
<p>（三）鎔解——以矽砂加入已經燒練之礦砂內，而同時鎔化之，於是矽砂乃與氧化鐵合成浮渣，而自與銅質分離，再加石灰，可使之更易燃燒，而更能將銅分出。（未完）</p>
<h3>建築行話（九）</h3>
<p>— 梅震寰</p>
<p>——關於築場裏用——</p>
<p>扎針—泥水匠在砌牆時候。對於應該有踏脚綫（Skirting）大頭板（Lining)和盡鏡綫（Picture　Moulding）等地方。必需要相隔一二尺位置按放一塊木磚（詳前）然而有些泥水匠往往不聽監工者的指揮。亂七八糟的把砌牆比做玩巴戲。疏忽中將木磚漏去。等待磚牆上塗好粉刷。預備木匠動手的時候。困難就跟着追蹤而來。原來在漏去木磚的地方。勢必要木匠再費一番手續。這手續就是扎針。可是扎針是什麼意思。就是用斧頭削好的尖形小木塊。把它嵌在本來預備裝修的墻身上。因為不是這樣做。磚塊是受不住拉力的。裝修上的踏腳綫之類的東西。恐怕不久就容易壞掉或跌落。扎針這用場。倒是再好沒有的一種補救木磚漏去的好法子。</p>
<p>企口—舖樓板用的一寸六寸或一寸四寸的洋松板。（有些是一寸二寸的。然而大都是柳安（Luan）和柚木（Jeck）居多。）兩邊好像雌雄筍（Join）形的地方。呌做企口。所以呌樓板也呌企口板。對於這種企口是用以舖樓板時。木匠使鐵馬（Clamp）（詳前）排緊比較便利的設備。</p>
<p>剷口—門或窗的膛子。預備裝修的地位。另外比較闊大些。這呌做剷口。</p>
<p>風漏—門或窗的下冒頭和地面或窗盤相距過大。中間當然有一條空檔。這種空檔呌做風漏。</p>
<p>庇水—門或窗的外端。在下冒頭另裝一塊斜勢的薄板。以防雨水的倒留屋內。這薄板呌庇水板。</p>
<p>牛腿—房屋如遇洋台的地方。在洋台下面的兩旁。就是牛腿。牛腿的形狀。像牛的腿部而名之。它有受厭力的載重。大都用鋼骨水泥三和土的多些。</p>
<p>地籠—比較考究些的房屋。其底脚部份。和地板的相差。並不像普通房屋在滿堂三和土上排好擱柵。就將地板舖妥的簡單。它至少有三尺以上的空隙。但對於地板的排法。假使面積稍為闊大。那末擱柵排在兩頭牆身上。不容易受厭力的載重。這時就在空隙中間。砌以一條以上的牆身。這牆身呌做地籠牆（Sleeping　Wall）（待續）</p>

<h3>Washes Horse River Area Central Army Encircles and Annihilates Remnant Bandits Reports from All Sides Claim Zhu De is Dead</h3>
<p>Guiyang The Zhu Mao bandit gang, since the 2nd, secretly crossed the south bank of the Wu River from the area north of Xifeng, turned to flee eastward, and were ambushed by our Xifeng, Xiuwen, and Zazuo troops, with many bandits killed. The bandits fled in a panic eastward, and were blocked by our Kaiyang and Weng'an troops. On the 6th and 7th, they lingered on the west bank of the Qingshui River north of Guiding and Longli. Our army again divided and surrounded them on all sides. On the 8th, the bandits fled back westward from the Huchang area of Xima River. Our army advanced and attacked together from all around the bandits, gradually pressing them. By noon today, the entire bandit force was surrounded in the narrow area of Daxiaolong in Xima River. A fierce attack ensued, and bandit corpses were everywhere, flesh and blood blurred. The bandit crowd was in chaos and fled in defeat, and was intercepted by our army. It is estimated that in this battle more than 4,000 bandits were killed, and the number of captives is still being counted. According to the captured bandits, many bandit leaders were bombed to death. Zhu De was killed by the Nationalist army at Zhutoushan in Zazuo on the 3rd. His corpse was wrapped in red silk and carried away, and has not yet been buried. The remaining bandits are fleeing southwest in a panic towards Longli, and large armies have been dispatched to intercept and pursue them. The bandits are surrendering in large numbers. It is said that the bandits' morale is low, they lack ammunition, and they have already collapsed. It will not be difficult to completely annihilate this remnant bandit force in a short period of time. (Central News Agency telegram, 15th)</p>

<h3>Arichi Akira Pays Farewell Visit to President Wang Scheduled to Depart for His Country on the 20th Wang Hosts Farewell Banquet at His Residence</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Japanese Ambassador Arichi Akira, accompanied by Counselor Araya, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai at 2:45 PM on the 15th. After disembarking, they went to the Japanese Consulate to rest. At 4:00 PM, accompanied by Araya, they went to President Wang's official residence at Tiebu No. 1 to pay a visit. Gao Zongwu, Director of the Asian Affairs Department, was also present. They spoke for two hours. Arichi first stated that he was visiting to say goodbye because he was about to return to his country. He is scheduled to take the Ryuda Maru on the 20th, with the journey taking approximately three weeks. He will return to China as soon as his mission is completed. He then mentioned that he was quite satisfied with the recovery of Sino-Japanese relations in various places based on reports from the consuls-general he convened in Shanghai. He hopes that the Chinese side will continue to pay attention to this in the future. He did not mention other issues. At 8:00 PM, Wang hosted a banquet at his official residence to bid farewell to Arichi, and invited Vice Ministers Araya, Suma, Xu, and Tang to attend. Arichi is also scheduled to host a return banquet at the consulate at 8:00 PM on the 16th. He will return to Shanghai that evening. (Special telegram, 15th)</p>

Arichi is returning to his country for a routine vacation to report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and will return to his post in three or four weeks. The issue of upgrading Sino-Japanese diplomatic envoys was not mentioned by either side. (Special telegram, 15th)</p>
<h3>The New Security Corps in the War Zone Changes Guard Formal Notification to the Japanese Side</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the change of guard of the new security corps in the war zone, a formal notification must be given to the Japanese side before the deployment begins. Currently, Yin Rugeng and Tao Shangming are working with the Hebei Provincial Government to expedite the notification procedures. Once the notification is issued and received by the Japanese side, the movement will begin. (Special telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Several Japanese personnel will arrive in Tianjin this week. When the new security corps is deployed, these personnel will notify the Japanese troops stationed in various places along the route of the new security corps to avoid misunderstandings. (Special telegram, 15th)</p>
<h3>Illegal Militia Suppressed in the Entire Yutian County</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) He Jinjia, the chief of the third district public security bureau of Yutian, secretly colluded with Liu Guitang's troops. He was arrested by Zhou Yuying, the commander of the third security regiment, on the 13th and will be sent to the provincial government for interrogation. Zhang Xifan, the head of the illegal militia in the second district of Yutian, was arrested. His more than 300 troops were surrounded by Zhou Yuying's team on the 14th and disarmed and dismissed. Currently, the illegal militia in the entire Yutian county has been suppressed. (Special telegram, 15th)</p>
<h3>Remnants of Wang Jizong's Troops Flee Back to Pianshiyu Security Corps Encirclement and Suppression in Progress</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Remnants of Wang Jizong's troops, led by bandit leader Wang Qingfang, fled back to Pianshiyu in Zunhua on the 13th. Zhou Yuying's security corps, in cooperation with a company of Wang Zhanyuan's troops, surrounded and attacked the bandits' hiding place. As of the evening of the 14th, the attack had not yet been successful. The bandits are familiar with the geography of the key passes along the Great Wall, so they escape quickly and are not easily annihilated. A small group of bandits appeared near Tuntouying in Qian'an on the 13th, causing serious disturbances. The local militia went to suppress them. It was found that this group of bandits was part of Liu Guitang's gang. Because bandits were causing disturbances in Hongshiya and Pianshiyu, the Zunhua county seat was put on alert by the local militia. The provincial government ordered Zhou Yuying and Yang Yuwo, the two commanders of the security regiment, to annihilate the bandits in Pianshiyu to avoid future troubles. A large team of Zunhua militia was transferred to Zhuma Village to prevent the bandits from infiltrating. On the 13th, the bandits sent someone to Zhou Yuying's troops to request amnesty, which was rejected by Zhou. (Telegram, 15th)</p>
<h3>Yin Tong Arrives in Nanjing Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Yin Tong arrived in Nanjing yesterday morning and reported that Chairman Huang's illness has improved and he has gained weight. The treatment is not yet completed. He will not be able to return to Nanjing in the next few days. There are still more than ten injections to be given, which will take more than ten days. The estimated date of arrival in Nanjing is in early next month. Huang will assume the position of Minister of the Interior upon arrival in Nanjing and will remain in Nanjing to handle ministerial affairs. He will not return to the north immediately. I visited Huang on Mogan Mountain and reported on the situation in the war zone. The rest was research in nature. What can be disclosed is only that Mr. Huang indicated that he would return to Nanjing soon. When passing through Shanghai, I planned to visit Minister Gu, but the date was cancelled because Gu was tired. The reorganization of the North China war zone has come to an end. The redeployment of the security corps can be determined before the 20th of this month. It is undecided whether to establish a security command. However, a commissioner has already been appointed. For the sake of convenience of command and reducing twists and turns, it seems unnecessary to add a command. The Tianjin telegram reported that my trip to Nanjing was to ask the central government for guidance on the selection of personnel. This is speculation and not confirmed information. What can be reported now is that the order in the war zone has become stable. Remnant bandits and displaced people have been suppressed. There are currently no major problems. All administrative matters have been unified. Even the redeployment of the security corps only requires notifying the Japanese side because of the relationship in the war zone in the past. No other plans are needed. I will stay in Nanjing for two or three days and then return to the north. I will visit President Wang this afternoon and plan to go to Japan via Korea on the 26th of this month to attend the Japan Railway Tourism Conference. The conference was initiated by the Japanese Ministry of Railways. Five official and business groups were invited. The Jinpu, Beining, and Jinhu Railways were all invited and will be represented by me. I will also visit the road administration with Bao Xishen, the director of the transportation department of Beining, and Wang Zhengcang, the director of the passenger department. The conference will be held from May 2nd to the 12th and will return to the country in three weeks. (Special telegram, 15th)</p>
<h3>A Bomb Discovered in Front of the Puppet Dadaong Company in Yu County</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) At about 8:00 PM on the 12th, after the Shanhaiguan puppet Dadong Company dispersed, a paper-wrapped bomb was suddenly discovered in front of the gate. It was discovered by someone and taken away without exploding. On the 13th, the Japanese military police searched the entire city and arrested those involved in the incident. (Special telegram, 15th)</p>
<h3>Puppet Side Forms Arms Smuggling Group in Jinzhou</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The puppet side has formed an arms smuggling group in Jinzhou to exclusively supply arms to various bandit troops in the war zone. Its transportation routes are Panjia, Xifeng, Lengkou, and the various bandit troops in the Shanhaiguan war zone. The endless supply of arms is due to this. The bullets used by the bandits entrenched in Pianshiyu are all made by the puppet Northeast Arsenal. The Zunhua militia has cracked down on two arms smuggling incidents for several days and arrested several puppet offenders. (Special telegram, 15th)</p>
<h3>Chairman Lin Gives a Speech on the Problem of Clothing at the National Government Memorial Week</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) At the National Government Memorial Week on the morning of the 15th, Yu Youren, Niu Yongjian, Wang Yongbin, Lin Xiang, Chen Daqi, Chen Xunyong, Huang Musong, Lu Chao, Wei Huai, and other officials from various ministries and departments, totaling more than 600 people, attended. Chairman Lin led the ceremony and then gave a speech on the problem of clothing. He first said that the clothing problem discussed by the Premier in the fourth lecture on the Principle of People's Livelihood is to solve the needs of people's livelihood, not to solve the problems of comfort and beauty. That is to say, how should we, the 400 million people of China, try to ensure that everyone has clothes to wear. Secondly, there are four kinds of materials for making clothes in China: (1) silk, (2) hemp, (3) cotton, and (4) wool. Recently, due to the continuous import of foreign goods, the sales of domestic products have plummeted. At the same time, we have not paid attention to improving manufacturing in a timely manner, resulting in the dumping of foreign goods and the outflow of money. According to customs statistics, my country's annual trade deficit is as high as 700 to 800 million yuan. If the Chinese people only seek to meet their living needs in terms of clothing, do not seek beauty, and do not seek luxury, and everyone wears clothes made of domestic materials, then the country will be able to plug a huge loophole every year. Therefore, solving the clothing problem is an important work to save the country at present. He continued to say that recently, many factories, because it is easy to make money by using foreign raw materials, have abandoned the good raw materials inherent in the country and purchased imported products, so China's agricultural products have no sales channels, resulting in rural bankruptcy. Because of rural bankruptcy, the people's purchasing power is decreasing day by day, which ultimately leads to the economic downturn of the national industry and commerce. Factories like to use imported products as raw materials, but in fact, it is a suicidal policy. Recently, the silk industry has declined due to the influence of rayon, which is a lesson from the past. Finally, he said that advocating domestic products should be advocated by those who wear clothes, and factories and stores should also advocate it. Everyone should advocate domestic products with one heart and one mind, and advocate silk and homespun cloth, so that the clothing problem mentioned by the Premier can be solved.

<h3>Ma Chaojun Reports on Municipal System at the Central Memorial Week</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) On the morning of the 15th, the Central Government held the 178th Memorial Week. Ye Chucang, Ju Zheng, Chen Lifu, Ma Chaojun, Wang Qi, Li Zonghuang, and all the staff, totaling about 500 people, attended. Ye Chucang chaired the meeting. After the ceremony, Ma Chaojun reported on "The Current Municipal Systems of Various Countries and the Current Situation and Future Construction of the City of Beijing." He briefly stated: (A) The current municipal systems of various countries are roughly divided into five types: the municipal council system, the separation of powers mayor system, the committee system, the city manager system, and the centralized mayor system. Each system has its advantages and disadvantages. For example, the municipal council system has great shortcomings. The disadvantages of the separation of powers system lie in the inability to concentrate power. The disadvantage of the committee system lies in the uneven quality of the people. Among them, the city manager system and the centralized mayor system are suitable for modern cities because their powers are easy to concentrate and their responsibilities are specific, so they can cope with them easily. (B) In the past, the municipal administration of Beijing City failed to fully achieve the two points of complete organization and specific responsibility. For example, the municipal government cannot control the police power and cannot operate public utilities, so it is difficult to achieve the effect of directing the arms. In addition, the municipal finance budget for the 23rd year has a balanced income and expenditure of more than 6.65 million yuan, which is much less than that of the 22nd year. Regarding education, it was decided to build more primary schools and add municipal middle schools and rural primary schools in order to popularize them. In terms of construction, it was decided to start the construction of the Beijing City drainage system first in order to benefit the people's health. After the speech, the meeting was adjourned.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>European Situation After the Stresa Conference</h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>The Stresa Conference concluded on the morning of the 14th with resolutions made by the three nations of England, France, and Italy. There are eight points: (1) The three nations of England, France, and Italy reiterate their obligations under the Locarno Treaty. (2) Conclude a "Sky Pact." If Germany participates, there will likely be no further bilateral treaties between England and France, France and Italy, or England and Italy. (3) A Rome Conference is scheduled for May to establish a Central European Pact. (4) To complete the peace of Eastern Europe, the three nations believe it is necessary to continue past efforts. (5) The rearmament of Central European countries should be jointly agreed upon by the relevant countries within the scope of regional security. (6) Hope that Germany rejoins the League of Nations. (7) Recognize that the maintenance of peace and the limitation of armaments require Germany's cooperation. (8) Declare that the policy of the three nations is to jointly seek the maintenance of peace within the framework of the League of Nations. They unanimously advocate close cooperation and effective prevention of unilateral treaty abrogation actions that could endanger European peace. From these eight points, it can be seen that the attitude of the three nations of England, France, and Italy towards Germany has not changed compared to two or three months ago. The conclusion of the Central European Pact and the policy on Germany's rearmament are no different from what was agreed upon in the Franco-Italian agreement of January 3. Points (2), (3), (4), (6), and (7) are all established rules agreed upon during the Anglo-French London talks of February 3. In addition to the various points agreed upon by England, France, and Italy in the past two or three months, the Stresa Conference further aligned the three nations' steps towards Germany. England and Italy reiterating their obligations under the Locarno Treaty is intended to increase the guarantee of France's security, and the declaration of policy coordination among the three nations indicates the unity of the three nations' front against Germany. Therefore, the result of this Stresa Conference is particularly beneficial to France.</p>
<p>Historically, the policies of European countries towards Germany have often changed based on Germany's external attitude. The current alignment of the three nations of England, France, and Italy's policy towards Germany is indeed related to the attitude Germany revealed after reclaiming the Saar. On the French side, it was initially thought that after the Saar returned to Germany, it might slightly appease Germany's resentment, thereby reopening the door to collective European peace. Who knew that after the Saar returned to Germany, the German side became high-spirited and increasingly ambitious. For a time, there were many opinions advocating for resolving the issue of Austria's return to Germany through a vote. At the same time, they were unwilling to relax a step in the development of Eastern Europe. As a result, France and Italy became uneasy, and the Soviet Union's hatred of Germany intensified. Before British Foreign Secretary Simon's visit to Germany, the German government suddenly announced the resumption of conscription, expanding the national defense force to thirty-six divisions. During Simon's visit to Germany, they also demanded 400,000 tons of naval power from England, as well as an air force equal to England's. As for the Central and Eastern European treaties, they were rejected with a stern attitude. This was also enough to make England uneasy. Therefore, not only was the Franco-Russian military alliance brewing, and the Franco-Italian relationship deepening, but all of this was caused by Hitler's decisive actions. Even the harmonious attitude of England towards France is somewhat related to Germany's attitude. It is thought that Hitler's understanding of England's attitude may be insufficient. England certainly does not want France to dominate Europe alone, but how could it want Germany to dominate Europe alone? Judging from the recent situation, England's degree of aversion towards Germany may be even greater than its aversion towards France. This may be because France is a relatively peace-loving country; France is comparatively not a heavy industrial country; and in terms of trade, it is not a strong enemy of England. Furthermore, France is quite self-sufficient in its colonies, and there are not many conflicts with England. Germany's national power is growing daily, and France is already feeling strained in defending against Germany, so there is no possibility of harming England. On the contrary, the German nation has a very strong fighting force. During the European War, Germany, with its own strength, fought England, France, Italy, Russia, the United States, and other powerful countries for four years. Although it was inevitably defeated in the end, for four years, it always used enemy territory as a battlefield. Its own territory was never subjected to the disaster of war. The strength of its fighting force can be imagined. In addition, Germany is a heavy industrial country, making the restoration of armaments very easy. Moreover, its population is larger than France's, and its birth rate is higher than France's. Therefore, no matter from which point of view, the potential of Germany's fighting force is far above France's. Therefore, today's England has no need to actively support Germany and suppress France. What makes England even more uneasy is that most of Germany's pre-war colonies are in England's hands. If Germany wants to restore its pre-war position, merely defeating France will not help. Therefore, General Göring had an early plan to attack England with the air force, and even had a profound plan to join forces with Ireland to attack England. The reason why England first initiated the "Sky Pact" was because it learned of Germany's intention. The reason why Baldwin declared last year that England's national defense should be on the banks of the Rhine was also due to this. Today's England suspects Germany. This is very clear. Although Hitler saw through that the British Conservative Party government has no goodwill towards Russia, and wanted to use the strategy of opposing Russia to achieve his ambition of eastward expansion and win England's sympathy for himself, he does not know that today's England is like a wealthy family, attaching importance to its wealth and life, and very much wants to maintain a state of peace and enjoy security. The reason why it leans towards France's plan to stabilize the European situation is because there is no better way to stabilize the European situation other than maintaining the status quo. Russia adopts a policy of peace. Recently, Eden actually hired Russia. It can be seen that today's England and Russia have no irreconcilable contradictions. Therefore, the consistency of attitude of the three nations of England, France, and Italy in the Stresa Conference was not accidental.</p>
<p>Under this situation, Germany naturally has only two paths to take: (1) To disregard its own isolation and refuse to participate in the collective peace movement set by the three-nation conference. (2) To accept this peace method and automatically participate in the conclusion of various pacts. If the latter path is taken, the European situation can still be stabilized. Even if the former path is taken, it may not immediately hinder European peace. In Western Europe, England and Italy have already reiterated their obligations under the Locarno Treaty, so France's security should be guaranteed without any problems. In Central Europe, France, Italy, and other countries will definitely find a way to establish a pact to guarantee the peace of Central Europe. In Eastern Europe, the military alliance of France, Russia, and Czechoslovakia will definitely replace it with the Eastern European Pact. Therefore, to put it bluntly, Germany's participation in or refusal to participate in the collective peace system of England, France, and Italy makes little difference in the current situation. Germany knows this is the case. Therefore, as the Stresa Conference was about to close, it suddenly revealed its intention to conclude an Eastern European Non-Aggression Pact, and also stated that although it itself is unwilling to participate in the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact containing a military alliance nature, Germany does not object if other countries want to conclude it. This sudden change in attitude is the result of the consistent attitude of the three nations of England, France, and Italy. At the same time, Germany also deeply knows that the form of collective European peace has taken shape. If Germany opposes it alone, it will only isolate itself.</p>
<p>From this perspective, the Stresa Conference has had a considerable effect on stabilizing the European situation. We dare to clap our hands and celebrate for the peace of Europe. However, international winds and clouds change in an instant. The armaments of European countries have already been competing to expand due to Germany's implementation of conscription. In addition, the points of conflict of interest with each other are increasing day by day. The so-called peace is only an armed peace. Whether peace is easily maintained when it is built solely on the basis of arms is also a big question. Therefore, although the recent tense situation in Europe has eased due to the Stresa Conference, it seems that we should not prematurely hold excessive optimism about the future of the European peace situation.</p>
<h3>Japanese Foreign Ministry Plans to Adjust Relations with the United States; Plans to Send Industrialists to the United States for Investigation; Idebuchi to Shoulder Goodwill Mission to Australia This Summer</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The heads of the Japanese Foreign Ministry believe that the visit of the American economic inspection group to Japan is the best opportunity to enhance friendly relations between the two countries. They are currently considering various concrete methods to promote Japan-US goodwill. However, looking at the current Japan-US relations, (1) The attitude of the United States towards Japan after the London Naval Preparatory Conference is not without unfriendly aspects. Various anti-Japanese bills discussed by the state assemblies of Arizona, California, and Washington, the plan to build air force bases in the Aleutian Islands of the North Pacific, and the Pacific Islands liaison flight plan can prove this. (2) However, the United States' recent attitude towards Japan is quite passive. For example, its protest regarding the "Manchukuo" kerosene monopoly issue is not as strong as that of the United Kingdom. Its opinion on the issue of loans to China is almost the same as the Japanese government's view. (3) There are many people in the United States who are demanding a change in the North Pacific naval exercise plan. The visit of the British Far East Fleet to Japan has the meaning of easing Japan's feelings towards the United States. From this point of view, if the United States changes its previous Far East policy, Japan will recently improve its relations with China and Russia, creating an atmosphere of friendship. The situation of Japan-Russia disputes and Sino-Japanese opposition that the United States fears has already disappeared. Therefore, the conditions for enhancing friendly relations between Japan and the United States are in place. However, important political and diplomatic pending issues such as naval disarmament and the Japan-UK-US peace agreement cannot be completely resolved at once. Therefore, it is most appropriate to first develop Japan-US trade and commerce and attempt to build the foundation for friendly relations between the two countries. The Foreign Ministry currently has a plan to organize a inspection group of powerful industrialists to be sent to the United States at an appropriate time, to adjust the economic relations between the two countries and establish the first step towards Japan-US friendship. (Reported by the Japan United Press on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Negotiations on the Japan-Australia trade treaty are progressing smoothly. Foreign Minister Hirota is determined to take this opportunity to increase friendly relations between the two countries. It has now been decided to send former Ambassador to the United States, Katsuji Debuchi, to Australia this summer for an official visit to the Australian Federal Government. He will also discuss trade and commerce issues with influential figures in the private sector, and inspect various political, economic, and cultural facilities.

<h3>Third Stratosphere Test Flight; Pust Fails Again; Only Hundreds of Miles from Destination; Landing Midway Due to Damaged Parts</h3>
<p>Lafayette, USA Captain Pust's transcontinental stratosphere flight across America failed for the third time today. Pust is of Indian descent and has lost one eye. He took off from Burbank, California, at 7:27 AM this morning (Central Standard Time), but landed here at 3:40 PM due to damage to the aircraft. Since Pust has planned to cross the continent at an altitude of 30,000 feet in seven hours, he has repeatedly failed. The first time he only flew 100 miles, and the second time he ran out of oxygen and landed in Cleveland. Today he was only hundreds of miles from his destination, but he still failed to succeed. What a pity! (Reported by the Kuo Min News Agency on the 14th)</p>
<p>Los Angeles Famous American aviator Captain Pust made his third attempt this morning to travel through the stratosphere from Los Angeles to New York. Pust, wearing a specially made oxygen suit, prepared to fly at an altitude of 33,000 feet to New York, which is 2,450 miles away. It is expected that he can reach his destination in seven or eight hours, without the usual 18 hours. After Pust flew up, he jettisoned his landing gear and will rely on gliding to reach the ground. The purpose of this ascent is the same as the previous two, to test whether the stratosphere can be used as a medium for regular sky transport. The second attempt was held on February 23. Due to a ruptured oil pipe, he was forced to land. On March 15, the second test flight failed because the oxygen ran out. If he succeeds in his ambition today, Pust will be the first person to travel through the stratosphere across North America, and will break the record for the fastest flight from Los Angeles to New York. (Reported by Reuters on the 14th)</p>
<p>Lafayette Pust's third attempt to travel through the stratosphere from Los Angeles to New York has now failed again. He flew out at 5:27 AM this morning, but was forced to land at Purdue University Airfield in Indiana because a vital screw was lost from the fuselage. He told reporters that he had reached an altitude of 33,000 feet and a speed of 300 miles per hour. If there had been no changes, he would have been able to fly to New York in eight hours at this speed and altitude. (Reported by Reuters on the 14th)</p>

<h3>Muslim-Hindu Conflict in India</h3>
<p>New Delhi Religious riots have occurred in Firozabad in Agra and Botad in Mumbai, resulting in dozens of deaths and injuries. Police in Firozabad had difficulty restoring order at the time. They initially used batons, but the crowd still did not disperse, and were eventually forced to open fire. Before the shooting, one Hindu had already died. A total of 35 Muslims and Hindus were injured. The police fired about 30 bullets, killing one Muslim and injuring seven rioters. The demonstrators then dispersed. Order was restored. Before long, the rioters regrouped and set fire to a doctor's house. All eleven people living in the house, including three children, died in the fire because there was no way to escape. The police rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm and dispersed the mob. During the disturbance, two police officers were injured. In total, including those burned to death, 13 Muslims and Hindus died that day, and 42 were injured. The details of the riots in Botad are unknown. All that is known now is that a religious conflict occurred there last night. The two sides fought each other with bricks, stones, glass bottles, and other objects. It is reported that six people died and many were injured. The authorities have dispatched armed police to the area to suppress the riots. (Reported by Reuters on the 14th)</p>

<h3>France Sues Germany for Treaty Violation; Focus of European Situation Shifts to the League of Nations; Executive Yuan Holds Secret Meeting Yesterday; Little Entente Agrees to Increase Army Sizes of Hungary and Austria</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Executive Council will meet this afternoon to consider France's complaint against Germany's reintroduction of compulsory military service. The procedures to be adopted will be discussed in private at that time. The first public meeting will be held tomorrow morning. French Foreign Minister Laval will present the French memorandum. British Foreign Secretary Simon, Italian Foreign Minister Aloisi, Czech Foreign Minister Beneš, and Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov will all speak in succession. It is expected that the meeting will end on Wednesday. Laval arrived here yesterday and will travel to Russia and Poland on Saturday. British Foreign Secretary Simon arrived here this morning and is in close consultation with Laval and other council members of the League of Nations. It is expected that Polish Foreign Minister Beck will object to France's complaint. (Reported by Reuters on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) It is heard that the three countries of France, England, and Italy have agreed on the outline of the resolution, which includes: (1) The Executive Council should declare that it cannot recognize treaty violations as a tool of international politics. (2) The Executive Council should express regret for the German government's decision to reimpose compulsory military service. (3) A committee of experts should be established to study the matter and prepare recommendations, stating the best plan to prevent treaty violations in the future. (4) The Executive Council should recommend an organization seeking security based on a pact of mutual assistance. (Reported by Reuters on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) It is generally believed in political circles here that, in order to prevent unilateral treaty abrogation in the future, the League of Nations will form a committee responsible for economic, financial, and political judgments to enrich Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant. These sanctions will be imposed immediately after the incident occurs, and sanctions will also be imposed on those who violate the treaty. (Reported by the Kuo Min News Agency on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) French Foreign Minister Laval recently arrived here from Stresa. Czech Foreign Minister Beneš and Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu went to the station to greet him. Laval exchanged greetings with Turkish Foreign Minister Rüștü Aras, Chairman of the Executive Council of the League of Nations, in the car. The two had a preliminary consultation on the Executive Council's discussion of the French application. (Reported by Havas News Agency on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Foreign Minister Laval met with Czech Foreign Minister Beneš, Spanish Representative Madariaga, and Portuguese Representatives this morning. Spanish Representative Madariaga may be the rapporteur for the French application. At noon, Laval had lunch with representatives of the Little Entente and the Balkan Entente. In the afternoon, he discussed the technical aspects of the Franco-Russian Agreement with Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov. This agreement will be signed in Moscow. In addition, Laval will also meet with Polish Foreign Minister Beck to discuss preparations for Laval's visit to Poland. (Reported by Havas News Agency on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) After Foreign Minister Laval had a long talk with the Foreign Ministers of the Little Entente this morning, the Little Entente unanimously supported the policy decided by England, France, and Italy at the Stresa Conference, which included allowing Hungary, Bulgaria, and Austria to increase their army sizes through negotiations. It is heard that the Little Entente has agreed to double the army sizes of Austria and Hungary. According to the current peace treaty, the two countries are limited to an army of 30,000 each. However, according to the proposal, each country will be allowed to expand its army to 75,000. However, both Hungary and Austria want 100,000, so this number is still far from what the two countries require. The League of Nations Executive Council was originally scheduled to hold an extraordinary meeting at 11:00 AM this morning, but it was postponed to 3:30 PM this afternoon to facilitate Laval's contact with representatives of the Little Entente. The result was satisfactory. Geneva officials were delighted to hear about it. (Reported by the Kuo Min News Agency on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) Foreign Minister Weikersheim set off for Geneva today to attend the meeting of the Executive Council of the League of Nations, and will take the opportunity to inquire about the results of the Stresa Conference. In particular, he will consult with representatives of the countries concerned on the various issues involving Austria. (Reported by Havas News Agency on the 15th)</p>
<h3>Berlin Refutes France, Defends Rearmament, Says the Blame for Breaking the Treaty Does Not Lie With Germany Because Nations are Competing to Expand Armaments</h3>
<p>(Berlin) After the French government sent a document to the League of Nations opposing Germany's implementation of compulsory military service, Germany has now responded with rather strong language, stating that other countries have extinguished the last hope of fulfilling the Treaty of Versailles, and Germany has no choice but to implement a compulsory military service system. Other countries are secretly increasing their armaments, and the League of Nations is powerless to stop them. When there was still a glimmer of hope that other countries would faithfully proceed with drafting the military system they were allowed, Germany firmly adhered to its military obligations upon joining the League of Nations.  Only after realizing that this hope could never be realized, Germany had no choice but to restore its freedom of action. Germany's army is limited to 100,000 men, while France has created millions of trained reserves. What France should know is that it bears the obligation to immediately proceed with disarmament in the final resolution of the Locarno Treaty. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The semi-official German news agency recently issued a statement responding to the memorandum submitted by France to the Executive Council of the League of Nations, explaining Germany's position. It stated that while the French memorandum superficially appears to be a complaint against Germany, the general impression is that it is a kind of defense for the "real defendant," because Germany's rearmament was caused by the actions of other countries. Germany was forced into this situation and had no choice but to take this action. The French memorandum deliberately ignores this point. For many years, France has not sincerely sought to fulfill its disarmament obligations. On the contrary, it has used various vague and indefinite proposals to stall and delay, making it impossible for Germany to take even the most basic measures to maintain its territorial security. Therefore, Germany had to prepare an appropriate defense so that if the last glimmer of hope for other countries to fulfill the Treaty of Versailles disappeared, Germany could use its indispensable armaments to deal with any eventuality. Furthermore, the preamble to the Covenant of the League of Nations clearly states that the purpose is to guarantee the peace and security of all member states. Germany has tried its best to make this provision a reality, but all in vain. Other countries deliberately evade their disarmament obligations and even accelerate their rearmament, while the League of Nations turns a blind eye. France has no sincerity in fulfilling its disarmament promises. On the contrary, Germany has always strived to find ways to eliminate obstacles in order to ensure the success of the disarmament conference. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Officials believe that the memorandum sent by France to the League of Nations is a test of whether the League of Nations is prepared to reform and bury the Treaty of Versailles. Newspapers, with government authorization, still say that France and its allies have failed to abide by the treaty and disarm, leading to Germany's rearmament. Therefore, the blame for breaking the treaty lies elsewhere. (Kokumin dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>British and French Prime Ministers Return Home</h3>
<p>Stresa. British Prime Minister MacDonald departed from here at 5 p.m. today. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini personally saw him off. French Prime Minister Flandin then set off for home at 9 p.m. Mussolini also went to see him off. A company of Fascist Party soldiers lined up to salute, and Flandin and Mussolini reviewed them. The military band first played the French national anthem, "La Marseillaise," and then the Italian national anthem, "Giovinezza," which was pleasing to the ear. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister MacDonald returned to London from Stresa, arriving here by plane from Paris at 1 p.m. He immediately went to the Prime Minister's Office on Downing Street, where he was warmly welcomed by the crowd. MacDonald declared that he would issue a statement tomorrow to explain the results of the Stresa Conference. According to Labour MP Attlee, the Stresa Conference issue will be raised for discussion in the House of Commons this Thursday, as the House will be debating defense issues on that day. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>The Stresa Conference Achieves Satisfactory Results, Opening a Door to European Peace, the Three Countries Jointly Avert a Crisis, and All Parties Express Satisfaction</h3>
<p>Stresa. The European crisis has clearly taken a turn for the better today. The United Kingdom, France, and Italy have decided at the most promising Stresa Conference to take joint action to avert war. The three countries have formulated a non-aggression pact based on the principles expressed by German Head of State Hitler that he is willing to accept. France has softened its tone in demanding that the League of Nations directly rebuke Germany. The United Kingdom's advice to Germany to join the Eastern European Non-Aggression Pact has also been effective. This pact is different from the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact rejected by Hitler. Italy's proposal to convene a conference of Danube countries to discuss a Central European Mutual Assistance Pact has also been fulfilled. Mussolini is quite satisfied with this. The conference closed today, and the statesmen of the three countries were all in high spirits. (Kokumin dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Stresa. After the Stresa Conference closed, British Prime Minister MacDonald gave a speech thanking Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, saying, "There are currently only two paths, peace or war. We must try to open the door to peace until the very end. If the door to peace must be closed, then it should not be closed by us. If other countries wish to open the door to peace, we must give them the opportunity. If the door to peace is unfortunately closed in the end, then it should not be done in a dark room, but should be publicly announced in the light of day so that all honest and rational nations may know who is responsible." Then French Prime Minister Flandin gave a speech, saying, "If we cannot cooperate closely and unite for the sake of maintaining peace, then we will not be able to achieve the concrete results of this meeting. We sincerely cannot over-imagine it. We will inevitably encounter other similar difficulties in the future, but if we can continue to adopt the spirit of practical and active cooperation, as we have done in this conference, then why should we not be victorious?" Finally, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini delivered a speech expressing satisfaction with the progress of the conference, saying that the active mutual ties between the United Kingdom, France, and Italy are sufficient to guarantee European peace. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(London) The London side believes that the communique issued after the Stresa Conference is evidence that the three-nation conference has indeed fulfilled its intended goals. London believes that although the Stresa Conference did not establish a final decision, the three countries, the United Kingdom, France, and Italy, have completely agreed on what principles should be adopted in dealing with various issues in the future. These issues include the German rearmament issue, the Eastern European security issue, the respect for treaties issue, the Austrian issue, and the military system issue of the former German allies. In short, the Stresa Conference is only one stage in international negotiations, but it is a completely satisfactory stage. In addition, officials maintain a completely reserved attitude as to whether the principles listed in the Stresa Conference communique can be implemented one by one, believing that the implementation of these principles depends on the following: (1) the resolution of the Executive Council of the League of Nations; (2) negotiations between Germany and other countries on the Eastern European pact issue; (3) future negotiations at the Nine-Power Conference in Rome on the Danube River issue. However, besides the consensus of the United Kingdom, France, and Italy, British officials are fortunate that British cabinet members have consistently maintained the outline of British policy without wavering. What is the outline of British policy? That is, to reaffirm that the United Kingdom is determined to respect and strengthen the existing constraints in Europe, and to do its best to assist security organizations, but not to adopt any new constraints. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Press Commentary from Various Countries</h3>
<p>London</p>
<p>(London) All major cities here have expressed satisfaction with the results of the Stresa Conference. (Reuters dispatch, 15th) This morning, the newspapers commented on the results of the Stresa Conference, mostly expressing optimism, saying that the conference has made a major progress in the realization of the plan for the safety of Europe. For example, the "Daily Telegraph" said, "Judging from the communique issued by the Stresa Conference, although it cannot be determined that the leaders of the United Kingdom, France, and Italy have a complete understanding of the long-term plans for the future, at least the leaders of the three countries have reached a consensus on the practical measures for the second step, which is very gratifying. Not only that, the United Kingdom, France, and Italy are now united to collectively maintain peace, and the worries caused by Germany's actions and policies can also be dealt with by the three countries unanimously." The "Daily Herald," the organ of the Labour Party, criticized France's memorandum to the Executive Council of the League of Nations, saying that it was a bomb thrown on the international negotiating front. "If the League of Nations is only used to safeguard and strengthen the Treaty of Versailles, the result will inevitably be the destruction of the League of Nations and the entire collective system." (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Paris</p>
<p>Public opinion believes that the haze on the horizon has now completely dissipated, as the attitude of the United Kingdom has recently presented a fragile image.</p>
<p>(Paris) All newspapers expressed satisfaction with the results of the Stresa Conference, with the exception of the "Paris Echo," which adopted a reserved attitude. It was believed that the relations between the United Kingdom, France, and Italy were thereby reiterated, and the concept of security made great progress. The "Petit Parisien" stated, "The impression produced by the Stresa Conference is that there is a huge force of calmness and self-restraint that can, now and in the future, prevent Germany from acting in an overbearing manner." "L'Excelsior" said, "The Stresa Conference is history. From now on, the relations between the United Kingdom, France, and Italy will no longer be passive, but active." The "Le Matin" commented, "After the United Kingdom and Italy issued a declaration reaffirming the obligations stipulated in the Locarno Treaty, if Germany were to violate the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles regarding the demilitarization of the left bank of the Rhine, it would not only be violating the Treaty of Versailles, but also violating the current borders, and should be dealt with in accordance with the Locarno Treaty." "Le Figaro" said, "Prime Minister Flandin and Foreign Minister Laval have achieved very satisfactory results on this trip. The relations between the United Kingdom, France, and Italy have been solemnly and publicly reaffirmed, which is very fortunate." However, the "Paris Echo" expressed dissatisfaction, saying, "Some hopes, even if not completely lost, have at least not been encouraged. However, those who have no extravagant hopes believe that the Stresa Conference is still better than nothing." The "Le Journal" said, "The point that is worthy of attention in this conference is that the Austrian issue is of great concern to Italy. According to unofficial confirmed news, the methods of how to guarantee Austria's independence at a considerable time will be considered in detail by various countries. At that time, it may be proposed to conclude some kind of military treaty, which is undoubtedly, but this kind of treaty will definitely be subject to further negotiations in the future." "Le Temps" also made the same argument, saying that "The guarantee of Austria's independence will therefore take the form of a bilateral treaty. The countries concerned, such as France, Italy, and the Little Entente, will seek to stipulate the military actions to be taken in the event that Austria's independence is violated." In addition, "Le Temps" also said that the United Kingdom, France, and Italy agreed in Stresa to issue a warning to Lithuania, asking it to respect the autonomy of the Memel region. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Vienna</p>
<p>Views the compromise of maintaining Austria's territorial integrity and the decision to conclude a Central European pact at the meeting in Rome as two major achievements, and also views the meeting in Rome as an important step towards the establishment of a compromise between the Danube countries.</p>
<p>Budapest</p>
<p>A certain newspaper, with an authorized article, stated that Hungary must enjoy complete equal rights, including military rights, in order to join the Danube Pact as a member.</p>
<p>Berlin</p>
<p>The newspapers of the National Socialist Party all called the results of the Stresa Conference a victory for Germany. The Berlin political circles viewed the statement in the conference communique regarding the generation of a sense of security to maintain peace as a slight understanding by various countries of Germany's demands for security. The Berlin side sees the fifth section of the communique, which recalls that it had previously attempted to replace the military provisions in the Treaty of Versailles with an agreement, as an acknowledgment that Germany's rearmament of the land and air forces is a done deal. However, Berlin expressed regret that the conference failed to reach peace in principle along the path shown by Hitler.</p>
<p>United States</p>
<p>Public opinion can be viewed from the comments of the "New York Times." The newspaper said that the prestige of the League of Nations and the dignity of the treaty have not been lost in the mediation of Germany's rearmament. The peace statement issued by Hitler does not mean that he will turn to peace, but only means that he is not prepared to fight. But the Stresa Conference, if it only gives countries a rest, is still a gain in peace. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Romania</p>
<p>Bucharest. The French Minister to Romania, de Marmesson, is now transmitting to the Romanian government the decision of the Stresa Conference, especially the decision regarding the rearmament of Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria. The "Mundial" newspaper does not comment on the results of this meeting, but only publishes the telegrams from Stresa, with the headline "European Peace Has Been Saved," and states that "This victory should be attributed to the League of Nations, because the three Western European powers in Stresa completed their peace efforts in the spirit of the League of Nations." (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Czechoslovakia</p>
<p>Prague. Responsible parties are quite satisfied with the results of the Stresa Conference and are optimistic about Germany's attitude because Germany no longer opposes the signing of the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact. Regarding France's attitude at the Stresa Conference towards the issue of changing the military systems of the former German allies (namely Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria), responsible parties here believe that it is particularly sufficient to strengthen the links between Czechoslovakia and France. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Soviet Russia</p>
<p>(Moscow) Responsible parties here expressed satisfaction with the final communique of the Stresa Conference, saying that the United Kingdom, France, and Italy now agree to jointly oppose any future violations of the treaty. Responsible parties also believe that the full text of the Franco-Soviet agreement will be discussed by French Foreign Minister Laval and Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov at the meeting of the Executive Council of the League of Nations, the purpose of which is to enhance the effectiveness of Articles 10, 16, and 17 of the Covenant of the League of Nations.

<h3>Rumors of Assassination Discovered in Marseille, Unfavorable to Mussolini and Laval, but Paris Officials Say There are No Clues</h3>
<p>Marseille. According to news disclosed today, the police here arrested the old Italian anarchist Ganzil and his female assistant Garone on the 5th of this month. It is heard that the two intended to conspire to assassinate Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and French Foreign Minister Laval in Stresa. The two confessed that they belonged to the anarchist party and had attempted to cross the border to assassinate Mussolini and Laval. After failing in Stresa, the party also sent other members to Geneva to act. The Italian government had previously received warnings from here and other cities in Europe, so it dispatched 3,000 police detectives during the Stresa Conference to take special precautions. (Kokumin dispatch, 85th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the rumors of an assassination plot against Mussolini and Laval transmitted by the semi-official in Marseille, officials here declared today that there were no clues to such a plot.

<p>Madrid. Today is the fourth anniversary of the establishment of the Spanish Republic. Celebrations were held here. Troops paraded through the streets, and the military appearance was very grand. The left-wing Republican parties held banquets.

<h3>British Budget Bill Submitted to the House of Commons, MacDonald Rushes Back to Attend and is Welcomed, Chancellor Explains that Commerce and Industry are Improving, Estimates that Revenue and Expenditure are Offset with a Surplus</h3>
<p>(London) British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain presented his fourth budget bill in the House of Commons with a smile at 3:34 p.m. today. The House of Commons was full, and the visitors' gallery was also very crowded. British Prime Minister MacDonald, who had just returned from Stresa, was greeted with cheers when he entered the House and took his seat. The Chancellor began his speech by saying that there had been considerable progress towards recovery in the past year. Industrial production increased by 12 percent, setting a new record. Exports increased by £30 million, interest rates remained low, and the standard of living was still lower than when the government took office in 1931. Retail trade is gradually expanding, and the people have a thriving appearance. He had previously anticipated that the reduction of income tax by sixpence would be beneficial, and this has now been realized. Chamberlain spoke with a calm and cheerful attitude from beginning to end. Amidst laughter, he detailed the increase in the consumption of sugar, tobacco, and alcohol, and said that the entertainment industry had also improved. All of these developments are sufficient to show that there has been steady progress in all aspects, and there is hardly a place in the world that can compare with the current situation in the United Kingdom. Although the surplus for the past year was £7.5 million, the income exceeded expenditure by £19 million, excluding debt repayments. Steel production increased by 30 percent, pig iron production increased by 50 percent, and rayon production has set a new record. The time spent on resolving commercial disputes is shorter than ever before. The national debt has been reduced by £22.2 million, so the annual savings on interest can be £1.65 million. The Exchange Equalisation Fund has made a considerable profit in the past year, and this year's surplus will be even greater. He then continued to describe the income situation for the coming year, saying that the estimated expenditure is £703 million, and that additional funds for national defense must be raised, which is £10.5 million more than in the past year. Since the business situation in 1934 has greatly improved, it is expected that income tax can increase by £14 million, reaching a total of £237 million. Based on the current taxes, it is estimated that the income for the coming year will be about £736 million, and the surplus after deducting expenditures will be £5.5 million.</p>
<p>Chamberlain then announced that he would slightly increase the tax on soybean oil and the tax on heavy oil for road vehicles, which will increase the tax by eight pence per gallon from August. The fixed amount of debt interest will remain at £224 million. The expenditure for civil and social affairs must be increased by £14.5 million, the two main reasons for which are the increase in expenditure for shipping and agriculture by £4.5 million, and the increase in expenditure for unemployment relief by £5 million. The expenditure for road administration is £550,000. Seats costing six pence or less in entertainment venues will no longer be taxed. He then spoke of income tax, saying that those with an income of £135 will be taxed at eighteen pence per pound, instead of twenty-seven pence. As for those who already have a family, the original rule was that those with an income of £150 or more must pay income tax, but from now on, those with an income of £170 or more will pay taxes. The Chancellor did not say that the salaries of officials reduced in 1931 will now be restored to their original amount across the board. It is estimated that the reduction in income tax will reduce the government's revenue by £10 million in a full year, and the restoration of officials' salaries will cost the government an additional £5 million. Therefore, the net surplus after comparing income and expenditure will be about £500,000. Chamberlain spoke for one hour and thirty-three minutes, and finished speaking and took his seat at 5:07 p.m. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>

<h3>Sichuan-Guizhou Remnant Bandits Completely Collapse The Anti-Bandit Army Makes New Progress Zhang Xueliang Flies from Hankou to Guizhou</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Xu Xiangqian's remnant bandits in northern Sichuan failed to invade Shaanxi a month ago and returned to their den in Sichuan, attempting to prolong their survival by relying on the dangers of the Daba Mountains. Later, due to the encirclement and suppression by the National Army, the long-term siege gradually converged, and it was difficult to escape. Therefore, at the end of last month, they convened a cadre meeting at Wangcang Dam between Nanjiang and Guangyuan, deciding to cross the Jialing River and open up a new base area. On the 28th, most of the bandits crossed the Jialing River westward, including Wang Hongjian's 4th Pseudo-Army, He Wei's 9th Army, Yu Tianyun's 30th Army, and Sun Yuqing's 31st Army. After crossing the Qingjiang River, they attacked Zitong. Although Tian Songyao's army suffered some setbacks, Deng Xihou's army was waiting in full force. The defenses of the Fujiang River basin and the areas of Jiangyou and Mianyang are solid and there is no opportunity to take advantage. The remaining bandits on the east bank of the Jialing River, Wang Weizhou's 33rd Pseudo-Army, are very weak. Since the 6th Route Army occupied Nanbu and the 5th Route Army recovered Nanjiang, their bases have been completely lost and they have nothing to rely on. Therefore, on the 8th and 9th of this month, they attempted to attack Guangyuan. They are currently trying to break through Deng's army's defense line with the National Army to go to western Sichuan. Deng's army's Li and Huang brigades, who are guarding Zitong, fought hard to resist, engaging in fierce battles for two days and nights, completely defeating the bandits, capturing many. The remnant bandits fled in a panic across the river on the 11th and fled to Gucheng in Qingchuan and Pingwu, intending to occupy the Minshan Mountains. You Guangju's troops, stationed in Youjiang Zhongba, and Sun's brigade, stationed in Mianyang, have rushed to encircle and suppress them. Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek, in order to suppress the bandits as soon as possible, has ordered Hu Zongnan's division to take advantage of the victory and move south to block and defend the area around Zhaoguang, Pinghu, and Qingshan. The 3rd, 4th, and 5th routes of the Sichuan Army have also complied with the order and are about to encircle them. It is heard that the bandits have suffered huge losses in strength during their flight. The bandit leaders Xu Xiangqian, Zhang Guotao, Chen Changhao, and others are fighting fiercely among themselves. Sooner or later, it will not be difficult to annihilate them. As for Zhu Mao's remnant bandits in Guizhou, they were severely wounded in the Huangnishao battle near Guiyang under the close supervision of Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek, and are now on the verge of total collapse. The remnant bandits are fleeing between Wengan and Pingyue, and are now surrounded by the Guizhou, Yunnan, and Hunan armies. Their suppression is even more assured. Chief of Operations Zhang Xueliang recently received a telegram from Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek to go to Chongqing to discuss military affairs for the suppression of bandits. Zhang took off by plane from Hankou on the morning of the 13th and passed through Chongqing at 11:00 AM, reaching the Sichuan-Guizhou border. Due to fog, he returned. He arrived in Chongqing at 3:00 PM. After a brief stop, he met with Liu Xiang, He Guoguang, Yang Yong, and others that evening. On the 14th, he took the original plane to Guiyang to visit Chiang Kai-shek. As soon as the official business is completed, he will fly back to Hankou. (14th)</p>

On May 2, 1923, driven by passionate lust with Liu Gu, the wife of Liu Jinquan, he invited Dai [surname], Qiu Er [name], and carried hemp silk to Yinlang Jujiu's [place] where Liu Jinquan was tightly bound and drowned in a nearby river. The incident was discovered the next day, and the Public Security Bureau arrested them and transferred them to the Nantong Court, where each was sentenced to death. Qiu, dissatisfied, appealed to the Suzhou High Court. After review, Liu Gu was resentenced to twelve years in prison, and Dai [surname] and Qiu Er [name] were resentenced to twenty years each. Qiu Kousheng, the principal offender, was still sentenced to death. Apart from Liu Gu, who had already died of illness in prison, and the offenders Dai and Qiu Er, who are serving their sentences in prison, the principal offender Qiu Kousheng was taken to the execution ground at the Third Branch Prison on Sizheng Street in Suzhou yesterday morning (the 15th) at 7:00 AM by Prosecutor Shen Bingqian and Clerk Cui Jialu to verify his identity and was executed by firing squad.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Frequent Disasters Cause Deep Concern</h3>
<p>Our county suffered an extraordinarily severe drought last year. Although the disaster areas managed to harvest some grain, the poor were hoping for a bumper wheat and bean harvest this summer to make up for their losses. But after the spring snow disaster, heavy frost followed, and then cold, rainy weather repeatedly damaged the wheat and beans. The mulberry buds were also severely affected. Therefore, this year's wheat and bean harvest is completely disappointing, and the spring mulberry harvest has also been unexpected. There is no certainty about the future of silkworm rearing. The county is filled with a sense of despair. The number of unemployed people is increasing daily, and theft cases are also on the rise. The potential for future unrest is limitless.</p>
<h3>Homicide Case Autopsy Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>Gong A Da, also known as Yu Xiu (also known as Fan A Da), concubine of Yao Jishen, head of the first detachment of the 33rd brigade of the Fuan Township Hutai Town Business Corps in the Fourth District, was suddenly shot and killed early the day before yesterday. The incident was bizarre, and it shocked the entire town. Yao Jishen, the deceased's husband, along with Tu Zheng Yang Xuexuan, reported the case to the court for an autopsy on the 14th. Prosecutor Ren opened the court for investigation and ordered Yao Jishen to post bail, while Yang Yunxuan was dismissed. Yesterday (the 15th) at 10:00 AM, Prosecutor Ren, accompanied by Coroner Wang and bailiffs, went to the countryside to conduct the autopsy. It was confirmed that the death was caused by gunshot wounds. After the autopsy, the family members were ordered to prepare the body for burial. Furthermore, Chen A Gou, a villager from Shenjiawan, about three miles from Lizhoujing Lane, in the 64th Tu of the Third District, was also beaten and seriously injured the night before last. He died of his injuries that night. Zou Shiling, the Tu Zheng of the area, came to the city to report the case to the court, requesting an autopsy. It is reported that the murderer has been arrested and is scheduled to be brought to court today for questioning. Also, a floating corpse was discovered in the canal north of Meijing Hong in Gaoqiao Nei, the 10th Tu of the Tenth District. Tu Zheng Jiang Ziqing reported the case to the court for an autopsy.</p>
<h3>News Digest Published</h3>
<p>Shi Qinglin, the president of the Xishan News Agency in our county, has been engaged in the news business for more than twenty years. Recently, in order to save time for readers and reduce their burden, he has specially created a "News Digest," which is published every five days. It selects and compiles various international, party affairs, political, military, educational, commercial, and social news from various places within the past five days, allowing readers to grasp various current affairs news with a small amount of money in a very short period of time. Since its publication, it has been widely praised and is a rising star in the county's media landscape.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Bandit Yang Monk Arrested</h3>
<p>Yang Yongqing, a patrol officer of the Sixth Precinct directly under the jurisdiction of the Wuyi Qishuyan Public Security Bureau, in response to the repeated robberies in the area, dispatched police to investigate. At about 1:00 AM the night before last, he arrested a man named Yang Monk at the watch house, and took the watchman Zhao De, and pre-trialed [them]. The suspect, Yang Monk, confessed that the robbery at Xu Bingsheng's house in Jiudianxu of the Fifth District was carried out by seven people, who divided the loot of three or four yuan. Later, they robbed Lu Zhenda's house in Chengjiaqiao, stealing silver coins and gold rings, which they shared. On the night of March 16, they robbed Qiang Peide's house in Qiangjiatou, stealing a fur robe and a leather bag containing many clothes, which they pawned and divided, and so on. Patrol Officer Tang, considering that the suspect had repeatedly committed robberies with accomplices, transferred him to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation on the 14th. The watchman Zhao De and his wife, née Xu, were temporarily placed under surveillance, [in the role of] informants, to assist in the arrest of the remaining criminals, to bring them to justice.</p>
<h3>Letter: Questioning the Observation of Mars</h3>
<p>To the esteemed Editor:</p>
<p>I recently read in your newspaper on the 13th, the news "The Zijinshan Observatory observed Mars at 1:00 PM on the 12th," which seems to contain an error. According to Yin Chang's calculations, at 1:00 PM that afternoon, Mars was positioned at 16 degrees and 15 minutes of Libra, directly overhead in places around 80 degrees west longitude (such as Cuba and the Bahamas in America). The American astronomical community, with its meticulous observations, would have clearly seen this. In various parts of our country, it would have been impossible to witness. Furthermore, the names of the twelve zodiac constellations are based on observations prior to the 16th century. Due to the precession of the equinoxes, the spring equinox has regressed, and the constellations of hundreds of years ago have long moved to other houses. Therefore, Mars is now more than 16 degrees away from Virgo. Contemporary astronomers would not adhere to outdated methods and fall into the trap of "building a car behind closed doors that does not fit the tracks." However, reports from various newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai all state that Mars is currently located in Virgo, which is truly perplexing. We can try using a telescope at 5:40 PM (Shanghai is about 10:30 seconds earlier) on the 16th to observe Mars rising slowly from the eastern horizon. By 6:15 PM, when the sun sets below the horizon, Mars will be bright and visible to the naked eye. At 11:20 PM that night, it will pass directly overhead in the capital. It will then disappear around 4:55 AM on the 17th. Given these times of rising and setting, I wonder what kind of ground-penetrating telescope the observatory used at 1:00 PM on the 12th to observe (and even photograph) Mars on the back side of the Earth? I have written this letter specifically to present this [matter] and request that it be disclosed in your newspaper, so that I can ask domestic astronomical experts to resolve my doubts. Sincerely, Ruan Yin Chang, April 15th.</p>

<h3>Total Citywide Mobilization to Begin July 1: Implementing Compulsory Literacy Education. Party, Government, Education, and Media Representatives Attended the Municipal Government Memorial Week Yesterday. Mayor Wu and Director Pan Reported on Implementation Measures. Entirety Swore on the Spot to Unite Efforts to Accomplish the Mission.</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 9:30 AM, the Shanghai Municipal Government held a memorial week in the Municipal Government Auditorium, inviting all principals and deans of elementary and secondary schools, members of all levels of the Party, members of municipal committees from all districts, and staff members of the Education Bureau and Public Security Bureau to attend. Mayor Wu and Director Pan reported on the measures for implementing compulsory literacy education. Over a thousand people were in attendance, and they swore on the spot to resolutely promote the education. The atmosphere was tense, and the enthusiasm was unprecedented. Our Shanghai correspondent rushed to interview and report the details as follows:</p>
<p>Over a Thousand People Participate in Municipal Government Memorial Week</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Government provided special buses at the intersection of Xishi Road to transport participants, who arrived at the Municipal Government Auditorium one after another. Attendees included Mayor Wu Tiecheng, all staff members of the Municipal Government, Director Pan Gongzhan of the Municipal Education Bureau and all staff members of the Education Bureau, Party member Tao Baichuan and publicity committee members from all districts, Director Cai Jingjun of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and section chiefs, bureau chiefs, and heads of each precinct of the Public Security Bureau, and representatives from various groups such as the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Education Association, the Municipal Agricultural Association, and the General Labor Union, as well as heads of social education institutions throughout the city, principals and deans of elementary and secondary schools, principals of various people's schools and tutorial schools, and members of the municipal committees from all districts, totaling over a thousand people. The level of enthusiasm was unprecedented for a Municipal Government memorial week.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Reports on Implementation Plan</p>
<p>After Mayor Wu led everyone in performing the ceremony as usual, the mayor delivered a report, stating, in brief, "Fellow comrades, today the Municipal Government is holding a memorial week, inviting principals and deans of public and private elementary and secondary schools throughout the city, members of the Party committees from all districts, members of the municipal committees from all districts, and staff members of the Education Bureau and Public Security Bureau to attend the memorial week. The purpose is to report that Shanghai will begin implementing compulsory literacy education on July 1 of this year. According to statistics from the Ministry of Education, 80% of China's 450 million people are illiterate. Only one-fifth of the population is literate. Based on this, we can judge that the New China Movement, which has been ongoing for over forty years, has not yet succeeded. The reason is that 80% of the Chinese compatriots are illiterate, and their level of knowledge is too low. They cannot receive or understand our new movement. How can we make the people of the whole country work together? If we cannot make the people of the whole country work together, then, of course, the National Revolution cannot succeed. Relying on the efforts of a small minority cannot achieve success."</p>
<p>The Nine Major Movements for Reviving the Nation</p>
<p>The Chinese Kuomintang initially established six national salvation movements: first, the literacy movement; second, the afforestation movement; third, the road construction movement; fourth, the Baojia system; fifth, the cooperative movement; sixth, the hygiene movement. Later, a national goods movement was added. Last year, Chairman Chiang also promoted the New Life Movement, and recently Chairman Chiang proposed the economic construction movement, totaling nine movements, all of which are movements for the revival of the Chinese nation. However, since these movements are entirely national revival movements, they require the entire nation to rise up and work together to achieve success. Under the leadership of Sun Yat-sen, we have been engaged in revolutionary movements for the past forty years, but they have not yet been thoroughly successful. In fact, we are facing an unprecedented national crisis. The reason is that while these are called national salvation movements, in reality, only a small minority are calling for action and working hard, while the majority are living in a drunken stupor, unaware. Therefore, the reason for this is that over 80% of the people are illiterate, and their level of knowledge is too low to work together with us.</p>
<p>Literacy Movement is the Most Basic Work</p>
<p>The Chinese National Revolution has now reached the construction phase, and construction requires implementing these nine national salvation movements. However, the prerequisite for these movements is whether there is a way to make all of the 80% of the illiterate population in the country literate. If this problem cannot be solved, then the results of all future movements will be the same as in the past few decades, relying on the efforts of a small minority, which cannot succeed. Therefore, we are now first carrying out a widespread, large-scale literacy movement in Shanghai. Shanghai has 3.5 million people. Among those 3.5 million people, three-fifths live in the city, and two-fifths live in the concessions. About two million people live in the three-fifths [that are] in the city. Among them, about 500,000 are illiterate. These 500,000 people are between the ages of thirteen and fifty. In other words, among the two million people in the city, there are 500,000 illiterate adults. According to statistics from the Education Bureau, there are another 150,000 school-aged children from six to thirteen who are not in school. Together, there are 650,000 illiterate people."</p>
<p>Total Citywide Mobilization to Begin July 1</p>
<p>"Starting July 1 of this year, we will implement compulsory literacy education, mobilizing the entire population of the city to solve the problem of illiteracy in Shanghai within one year. In other words, the entire population of the city will be mobilized to dedicate one year of time and effort, from July 1 to June 30 next year, to make 500,000 illiterate adults and 150,000 out-of-school children in Shanghai literate. The purpose of our literacy education is threefold: first, to make them literate; second, to enable them to know common sense; and third, to implement civic training. Because universal education cannot be achieved in a short period of time by a small minority, universal education requires implementing mass education. Literacy education is the initial step in mass education. We need to enable illiterate people to become literate and, at the same time, gain considerable common sense and civic knowledge, so that they can understand and participate in and help implement any future movements. We see coolies everywhere in the city. They are illiterate, do not know the relationship between the survival of the nation and the country, and lack national consciousness. This responsibility lies entirely with us. We were not born literate, but we are better off than them only because of our superior family environment or circumstances. Only a few people out of ten thousand have this opportunity. Because they do not have this opportunity, they do not know the country and the nation, so we cannot blame them. This responsibility lies with the government, society, and those who are educated. We should be responsible for making them literate.</p>
<p>Shanghai's Success Can Influence the Whole Country</p>
<p>"Amidst the economic downturn in the country, Shanghai is in a better situation than the inland areas, and Shanghai also has fewer illiterate people than elsewhere. Our greatest duty is that we cannot have a moment of slack. As literacy education is implemented throughout the country, Shanghai should take the lead and always hold the belief that we will absolutely succeed. Shanghai has conditions that are more favorable than other places. If we fail, it will affect the whole country. Therefore, this responsibility lies with literate people, especially civil servants and Party members. If you do not take responsibility, you are not worthy of being a Party member or a civil servant in today's government. You are letting down the country, society, and your own parents. The success or failure of Shanghai's literacy education movement will have a great impact on the national literacy education movement. We must be responsible for ensuring the success of Shanghai's literacy education movement."</p>
<p>The City is Divided into Twenty-Two Areas</p>
<p>"Regarding the implementation methods, the city is divided into twenty-one districts, with ten schools in each district and six classes in each school. Each class is divided into adult and child categories, with a quota of fifty people. Classes are held three times a day, morning, noon, and evening. The first term will graduate in February, teaching them to recognize, understand, and use six hundred characters by mid-February. Teachers will be selected from two hundred to three hundred people to undergo short-term training before being assigned to carry out literacy education. Fearing that civilians cannot attend school, there will also be out-of-school tutoring methods. They can also be given a certificate after graduating in two months. Within the compulsory literacy education area, each person must teach at least two people. These are the general methods. A literacy education committee has now been established. The most important preparatory work is to investigate how many illiterate people there are in the city to serve as the basis for allocating school locations and times. Jiangwan and Hunnan have been designated as experimental areas. The other areas will all be established on May 1. July 1 of this year will be the day that Shanghai begins implementing compulsory literacy education. Literacy education is a basic movement for national salvation. Only with the success of literacy education can there be hope for the national salvation movement. This is the general report I wanted to give today. Please disseminate what I have reported today to everyone, so that we can awaken men and women, young and old, throughout the city to know that we must mobilize the entire population. If there are any methods that have not been taken into account, please ask Director Pan to supplement."</p>
<p>Director Pan Reports on Implementation Measures</p>
<p>Next, Director Pan reported, stating briefly, "Having heard Mayor Wu's important report on the implementation of literacy education in our city today, there is no need for me to say anything more. Now, upon the Mayor's order, I will supplement a few points regarding the methods. The entire education community of the city, all colleagues in the Municipal Government, and all comrades in the Party committees throughout the city should treat this literacy education work as a personal matter. The Mayor has already spoken about the total number of illiterate adults and out-of-school children in Shanghai. This is estimated only within the city. If we calculate the whole thing, it is still less than this number. The citizens of the concessions are also citizens within the scope of the Municipal Government, but we will start with the city first. If we are to use the method of mobilizing the entire population, this literacy education will take at least three hundred years. Assuming that out of Shanghai's 3.5 million people, one million are illiterate, and if we continue to do it as in the past, with the Education Bureau using Municipal Government funds to run people's schools, in three or four years, we will only teach 10,000 students to recognize 1,000 characters. It will take three hundred years to complete one million people. Therefore, we must change our methods to be effective."</p>
<p>Literacy Education Service Team, Literacy Education Mutual Aid Team</p>
<p>"Now, the city is divided into twenty-two districts, with ten schools in each district, six classes in the morning, noon, and evening, and fifty people in each class. Each district will graduate 3,000 people each month, which means that there will be 66,000 people throughout the city. However, relying on this method alone is still not enough. Therefore, there are two other out-of-school tutoring methods to enable those who cannot attend school to become literate. The first is to organize a literacy education service team, with the entire education community of the city, principals and teachers of elementary and secondary schools, and older students as the organizational center. All civil servants and party members will also join this team. People within the team can go to people's homes or be sent out to find illiterate people to teach them. The second is to organize a literacy education mutual aid team, in families, factories, or shops. The literate people in each unit will organize a mutual aid team, and all the illiterate people in that unit who cannot attend school will be helped and taught. These two organizations are intended to ensure that those who cannot attend school have the opportunity to become literate."</p>
<p>Punishments Should Be Enforced for Those Who Fail to Become Literate by the Deadline</p>
<p>"According to these two methods, it can be achieved within the scope of the city within one year. That is to say, within the special zone, if there are people willing to volunteer their services within one year, I think it can also be completed. As long as we are determined to do it, we should ask the Mayor to establish a rule that after one year is completed, at the end of June next year, anyone who is found to be illiterate must be punished by the Public Security Bureau. With strict execution, in this way, with both persuasion and punishment, there will certainly be no one who is unwilling to become literate. Secondly, we must understand that teaching illiterate people to recognize 600 characters is not considered achieving universal education. This is only an initial method. If it is effective within one year, we can proceed to the first phase next year. Therefore, everyone should not misunderstand that universal education in Shanghai only requires two months. Finally, we know that the Soviet Union was also over 80% illiterate before, and it was even more difficult than in China. However, from the 1917 revolution until now, it has only been seventeen years, and as a result, now over 80% are literate. Turkey is also the same. Therefore, if China wants to build and restore itself, it cannot ignore this."</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Leads Everyone in Reading the Oath</p>
<p>Finally, Mayor Wu proposed a joint oath to express determination, and everyone applauded in approval. The atmosphere was extremely tense. Then, led by Mayor Wu, everyone raised their right hand and read the oath as follows: "In order to revive the Chinese nation, build the Republic of China, and strive diligently and practically forever, in accordance with the Shanghai Municipal Government's literacy education measures, I take the responsibility of teaching illiterate people to complete the literacy education movement in this city. I hereby swear."</p>
<h3>Cai Kong Discusses Aiding Industry and Commerce: A Decision to Loan 20 Million Yuan; 15 Million Secured by Mortgage, 5 Million Based on Credit; To Be Managed Jointly by the Central Bank and Other Banks Together with Industry Associations; Strict Prohibition on Exporting Silver to Avoid Impacting the Market</h3>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, the United States continues to raise silver prices, and our government and public are planning ways to respond, to avoid adverse effects. After Mr. Song Ziwen, Chairman of the Board of the Bank of China, exchanged views with leaders of foreign banks, Mr. Song Ziwen reported the process to Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi yesterday morning. Mr. Kong then convened representatives from the financial sector in the afternoon to exchange opinions on silver issues and discuss ways to assist industry and commerce. It was decided to provide 20 million yuan in cash loans, to be managed jointly by the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and industry associations. After completing these matters, Mr. Kong departed for Beijing last night. Mr. Song will meet with reporters at the Bank of China at 10:00 AM this morning. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Song Visits Kong Yesterday</p>
<p>Mr. Song Ziwen, Chairman of the Board of the Bank of China, visited Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi at the Central Bank at 11:20 AM yesterday to report on the various opinions exchanged regarding silver prices during the banquet hosted by Mr. Ning at his residence the day before yesterday, which was attended by key figures from the British, American, French, and Japanese banking sectors, as well as the measures for cooperation between Chinese and foreign banks to maintain the market. He left at 11:45 AM and returned to the Bank of China to work.</p>
<p>Exchange of Opinions</p>
<p>In addition to the meeting convened by Mr. Song Ziwen the day before yesterday to discuss the issue of the United States raising silver prices, Mr. Kong convened representatives from the financial sector at the Central Bank at 4:30 PM yesterday to exchange opinions. Attendees included Mr. Song Hanzhang, General Manager of the Bank of China; Mr. Bei Songsun, General Manager of the Shanghai Branch; Mr. Tang Shoumin, General Manager of the Bank of Communications; Mr. Hu Bijiang, General Manager of the Zhongnan Bank; Mr. Ye Fuxiao, General Manager of the Dalu Bank; and Mr. Chen Xing, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank; Mr. Xi Demao, Manager of the Business Department; Mr. Xu Kan, Director of the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance, and many others. The meeting lasted about an hour, adjourning at 5:30 PM. According to sources, in addition to discussing measures to assist industry and commerce, opinions were also exchanged on silver issues. However, because this matter has a significant impact on the market, no one was willing to make any announcements.</p>
<p>Assisting Industry and Commerce</p>
<p>Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi met with reporters from various newspapers at the Central Bank at 5:00 PM yesterday, first discussing the issue of assisting industry and commerce. He stated that after consultation with the banking sector, a concrete plan had been decided upon, with a total amount of 20 million yuan, divided into two types of loans: mortgage-secured loans and credit-guaranteed loans. It was decided to provide 15 million yuan in mortgage-secured loans and 5 million yuan in credit-guaranteed loans, to be managed jointly by the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, together with the banking association. The plan will be implemented after the order is issued.</p>
<p>Responding to the United States</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of responding to the United States raising silver prices, Mr. Kong reiterated his previous remarks, stating that the equalization tax is sufficient to address the United States' increase in silver prices. However, the equalization tax rate cannot be increased immediately at this time to avoid foreign exchange being tied up for too long, which would be detrimental to domestic industry and commerce. Currently, the Central Bank and the Bank of China are handling this matter carefully. At the same time, foreign banks are also aware of the impact on the market and have all expressed their willingness to cooperate to maintain the market and will not export silver to seek profits. As for diplomatic actions, Mr. Kong stated that they are currently underway and have not stopped. However, the question of whether or not to protest is due to the fact that the United States has announced an increase in the price of silver purchased domestically, rather than an increase in the price of silver purchased from abroad, so the situation is slightly different.</p>
<p>Cracking Down on Speculation</p>
<p>Mr. Kong finally stated that speculators should consider the overall situation. Foreign banks are also aware of the impact of exporting silver on the market and have made various positive statements. It has been reported that certain small money shops on North Sichuan Road in this city and money shops in Xiamen are planning to export silver. Such individuals who cannot consider the entire nation and only seek to profit for themselves are traitors. In addition to having already telegraphed all customs offices to strictly crack down on smuggling, Mr. Song, Chairman of the Board of the Bank of China, has also telegraphed the branch offices of the Bank of China to advise business firms in those areas to refrain from seeking private gain at the expense of the overall situation.</p>
<p>Equalization Tax Rate</p>
<p>The Foreign Exchange Equalization Committee, through the consultation of members Xi Demao, Bei Songsun, and Zhang Peishen, decided on an equalization tax rate of 6.75% yesterday morning, the same as last Saturday. The telegraphic transfer selling prices announced by the Central Bank are as follows: one yuan in London equals one shilling and seven and a half pence; one hundred yuan in New York equals 39.375 US dollars; one hundred yuan in Paris equals 594 francs; one hundred yuan in Berlin equals 97 marks. The telegraphic transfer market rate in New York is the same as last Saturday.</p>
<h3>Finance Minister Kong Expresses Concern for the Disaster Situation in Guizhou Province; Transfers 100,000 Yuan to Yunnan for Relief</h3>
<p>Mr. Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and concurrently Minister of Finance, recently received a telegram from Chairman Jiang of the Military Affairs Commission, stating that the disaster situation in Guizhou due to banditry was very severe. After receiving the telegram, Mr. Kong immediately transferred 100,000 yuan to provide relief to the disaster-stricken people.</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi and Others Travel to Beijing</h3>
<p>Kong Xiangxi and Liu Weizhi traveled to Beijing on the night express train yesterday.</p>
<h3>Li Shizeng Discusses Impressions of Travel in Sichuan; Praises the Construction of Beibei and Hot Springs</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Mr. Li Shizeng, a member of the Central Committee, returned from a short trip to Sichuan a few days ago. Yesterday afternoon, at around 4:00 PM, he met with reporters from various newspapers at the World Society on Ferguson Road to share his impressions of his trip to Sichuan. A record of his remarks is as follows:</p>
<p>Touring Sichuan</p>
<p>According to Mr. Li, he had long admired the scenic spots of Sichuan. This time, he traveled to Sichuan with Mr. Zhang Jingjiang and Mr. Wu Zhihui purely for sightseeing purposes, with no political agenda. When we arrived in Sichuan, Chairman Jiang had already left Sichuan for Guizhou. Chairman Jiang was originally scheduled to return to Sichuan on the 6th, but Mr. Zhang and I waited until the 9th, and Chairman Jiang still had not returned to Sichuan. Therefore, we left Sichuan first and did not meet with Chairman Jiang. As for Mr. Wu, he had recently visited Huangshan and was deeply impressed by the beauty of Huangshan's scenery, reaching its peak. Therefore, he made a special trip to Mount Emei for a comparison.</p>
<p>Construction in Sichuan Province</p>
<p>I stayed in Sichuan for a total of ten days, five days in Chongqing, and five days traveling around Beibei and Hot Springs. Mr. Lu Zuofu has put a great deal of effort into developing industries and a new village in that area. Facilities such as science museums, museums, zoos, libraries, hospitals, middle schools, elementary schools, community clubs, and public education centers are all available. There is also a Beichuan railway, used exclusively for transporting coal, and a man-made canal, with parks on both sides. The aim is to use the power of artificial creation and scenery to create an industrial zone. Textile factories, coal briquette factories, ice factories, and various machinery industries are all available. If the entire province of Sichuan could put in the same effort as Beibei and Hot Springs in construction, then the future of Sichuan would be truly limitless. Although Sichuan has been at war for many years, the people are honest and simple, and recovery will be easy. I have not heard anything about the military campaign to suppress bandits in Sichuan.</p>
<p>Denying a Trip South</p>
<p>Recently, there have been rumors that I will be traveling south in the coming days, but this is not true. I have heard of the beauty of Guilin's scenery in Guangxi and would like to visit, but it is difficult to predict when this wish will be fulfilled. The rumors that I will be traveling south in the coming days are likely due to this. The International Cultural Conference is scheduled to be held in July, and I have decided to attend. Mr. Wu Zhihui is also a member and has not attended for several years, so I plan to travel with him this year.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Bank Manages Sugarcane Loan in Guangdong Province; Total Amount is 700,000 Yuan; Guaranteed by Guangdong Sugar Factory</h3>
<p>According to the National News Agency, the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank of this city, at the request of the Guangdong Provincial Government in February of this year, is jointly managing sugarcane loans with the Panyu Sugar Factory. It is now reported that the bank has agreed to provide a total loan of 700,000 yuan, of which the bank will provide 500,000 yuan and the sugar factory will provide 200,000 yuan, with an interest rate of 8%. It is also stipulated that a loan of 20 yuan can be provided per mu of sugarcane field. Sugarcane farmers in Panyu will automatically organize cooperatives or similar organizations to apply for loans from the sugar factory. Loans began to be issued last month, and one-third of the loans have already been issued. This loan is guaranteed by the sugar factory. When the sugarcane is harvested and sold to the sugar factory in the future, the loan amount will be deducted in full. This year is designated as a trial period. If the results are good in the future, it may be expanded and continued.</p>
<h3>Municipal Health Bureau Holds Epidemic Prevention Campaign; Preventive Work Begins on the First of Next Month</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Municipal Health Bureau, in order to prevent the occurrence of epidemics, launched an epidemic prevention campaign starting at 9:00 AM yesterday, and joined forces with the authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession to organize lectures, propaganda, epidemic prevention injections, and wireless broadcasts. It is also scheduled to begin preventive work against cholera on the first of next month.</p>
<h3>New Japanese Military Attaché Major General Isogu Arrives in Shanghai; Isogu is a "China Expert" within the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>Shanghai News from the China United News Agency, 15th: After Lieutenant General Suzuki Mitsutoshi, the Japanese military attaché to China, returned to Japan, the newly appointed military attaché, Major General Isogu Renkai, arrived in port yesterday (14th) afternoon aboard the Japanese ship Nagasaki Maru. Many military officials, including Commander Araki of the Japanese Marine Corps, went to the Huishan Wharf to welcome him. Major General Isogu's previous position was as the Second Chief of the General Staff of the Army. In 1917, during his time as a major, he served as a military attaché at the Japanese Embassy. He has since traveled extensively throughout China and is a "China Expert" within the Japanese Army. His special appointment as the chief military attaché to China this time is likely to have significant implications.</p>

<h3>Huge Dredger Ordered by the Whangpoo Conservancy Board Arrives in Shanghai; The Ship is Docked at the Zhanghuabang Factory Pier; The Chief Engineer Himself Went to Meet It; It Will Sail to Tongsha in Two Weeks for Testing; Dredging of the Shentan Shoal is Imminent</h3>
<p>According to the Datong News Agency, the Whangpoo Conservancy Board ordered the world's largest dredger from the Schichau Shipbuilding Company in Germany to dredge the Shentan Shoal outside the Wusong Estuary (i.e., Tongsha and Mensha). After the ship was completed in Germany, it set sail for China on February 8th. After more than two months, it finally arrived in Shanghai at 1:30 PM the day before yesterday (14th). Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Process of Supervision and Completion in Germany</p>
<p>The ship has been under construction in Germany for two years. First, the machine parts were completed by the Schichau Company's Elbing Machine Factory, and then they were transported to the Danzing Shipyard to assemble the hull. It was finally completed at the end of January of this year. Because the ship was designed by Chief Engineer Cha of the Whangpoo Conservancy Board, the Bureau specially sent Mr. Smith, a foreign engineer from the Dredging Section, and Chinese engineer Zhu Chongxi to Germany to supervise the construction. The ship's hull is 360 feet long, 60 feet wide, and has a draft of 18 feet. The dredging capacity is 3,000 tons per hour. The cost is estimated to be approximately 2.5 million Chinese dollars. (It is said that the ship is named "Construction").</p>
<p>Personnel Arriving in Shanghai the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>After completion, the ship set sail for China from Danzing on February 8th. The journey took it through the Kiel Canal, out the Strait of Gibraltar, across the Mediterranean Sea, through the Suez Canal, past the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean, through Saigon and Hong Kong, taking two months and six days. It entered the Wusong Estuary at noon the day before yesterday (14th), and docked at the Zhanghuabang Factory Pier of the Whangpoo Conservancy Board at 1:30 PM in the afternoon. Those who came to Shanghai with the ship included Mr. Johannsen, the ship's owner sent by the Schichau Company, Arndt, the helmsman, and about 30 other crew members.</p>
<p>Chief Engineer Personally Went to Meet It</p>
<p>Mr. Smith, the dredging engineer from the Bureau's dredging section who supervised the construction in Germany, came to Shanghai on another mail ship, so he arrived in Shanghai a month ago. Chinese engineer Zhu Chongxi arrived with the ship the day before yesterday. However, the day before yesterday was a Sunday, and the ship's wireless telegram notifying its arrival time arrived on the same morning. Therefore, only Dr. Cha Detley, the Bureau's Chief Engineer, and Mr. Diaomisi, a dredging engineer, were waiting at the dock before the ship berthed.</p>
<p>Testing Efficiency First at Tongsha</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the Datong News Agency reporter visited Chief Engineer Cha of the Bureau. According to Mr. Cha, the ship will first be tested for its efficiency after arriving in Shanghai. The test site will be the Tongsha Shoal outside the Wusong Estuary (i.e., near the Shentan Shoal). This test will begin in two weeks. At that time, Mr. Cha will personally lead eight key engineering and technical personnel to conduct the test together. As to how many days it will take to complete the test, it is still difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Dredging of the Shentan Shoal is Imminent</p>
<p>Mr. Cha continued, saying that the surveying project for Tongsha and Mensha has already been completed by the Hydrographic Survey. Therefore, as soon as the ship's efficiency test is completed, the dredging can officially begin. Matters such as acceptance and naming will also be carried out after the test. The dredging of Tongsha and Mensha is scheduled for five years, from a depth of 17 feet at low tide to a depth of 26 feet, with a width of 1,000 feet and a length of 20 English miles. The location of the shoal is about 30 English miles east of the Wusong Estuary, about 20 English miles from the mouth of the Yangtze River, which is the center of the Yangtze River's entrance to the sea.</p>
<h3>Art Exhibition: The Eighth Day of the Pre-Exhibition</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, yesterday (the 15th) was the eighth day of the Shanghai pre-exhibition for the London International Exhibition of Chinese Art. It was Monday, and as usual, viewing was suspended in the morning. The Qianlong Throne and Imperial Stationery, etc., were opened as usual in the afternoon, and a room was specially set up next to the entrance on the right side, named the Throne and Stationery Exhibition Room. The interior of the room was gorgeously decorated and had a rather imposing atmosphere. However, the throne was actually large and impractical, and not as comfortable as a modern sofa. The newly added album of sketches of flowers and birds by Dao Guang of the Five Dynasties, and the Silun Map by Liu Songnian, were displayed in the Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition Room. The sketch album was placed diagonally in a specially made glass cabinet, which was very convenient for viewing. Yesterday afternoon, there were many visitors, with estimates of no less than a thousand people. More items continue to arrive, and the association has already compiled a catalog. The Chinese part has been printed and distributed along with the catalog. The English catalog of newly arrived items is currently being printed and should be ready in a day or two.</p>
<p>Wu Hufan's Opinion</p>
<p>The Shanghai pre-exhibition of the London International Exhibition of Chinese Art has been open for eight days, and it is estimated that no fewer than tens of thousands of people have visited. Many opinions on the exhibition have been published in various newspapers. The opinions of Mr. Ye Gongchuo on the art exhibition have been published in various newspapers in Shanghai. Now, we will transcribe the opinions of Chinese painter Wu Hufan below. This London International Exhibition of Art was initiated by the United Kingdom to solicit ancient objects and exhibits from public and private collections in our country. Last year, Ambassador Guo stationed in the United Kingdom telegraphed the Ministry of Education to discuss the matter properly. The pre-selected items to be sent abroad will be opened for a pre-exhibition in Shanghai to show the public and facilitate public exhibitions. It was opened on the 8th of this winter month. Most of the exhibits are from public collections such as the Palace Museum and the Ancient Artifacts Exhibition Hall. Private collections are difficult to collect due to various reasons and because they are scattered in various places. Therefore, the proposal was shelved. Later, the British side requested the preparatory committee to reiterate the previous proposal to private collectors. However, the committee was worried that the results would not be sufficient and preferred to have quality over quantity, and was carefully considering a reply. The treasures in the Palace Museum and the Ancient Artifacts Exhibition Hall are known to all as the collections of the Ming and Qing dynasties. Although they have been scattered several times, they are still the most concentrated part of ancient artifacts in our country. The vault of the grand hall is under the watchful eyes of the public, and there are many treasures that cannot be witnessed by the people. Therefore, the ticket price for the exhibition is slightly expensive, but the audience is still crowded. However, for the sake of popularizing art, the price should be slightly lower so that poor and studious children will not have regrets. This is especially hoped and prayed for by the cultural authorities when the ancient objects are returned to the country for exhibition. In this exhibition, the bronzes of the Shang and Zhou dynasties, and the porcelain of the Song dynasty, are all well-organized and are treasures of the Chinese art history. A brief browsing is not enough to record them in detail. As for the painting and calligraphy section, most of them are genuine and exquisite. For example, the Spring Mountain Journey Map by Li Zhaodao is studied. Although there is no inscription to be found, its meticulous and powerful painting style is not found after the Northern Song Dynasty. The Dragon Sleeping in the Suburbs Map by Dong Beiyuan, with its majestic atmosphere, is one of the five great Dong Yuan paintings collected by Dong Wenmin. It is a masterpiece worthy of its fame throughout the ages. The Snow-Covered Spring Mountain Map by Guo Xi and the Four Pleasures Map by Yan Cipang all have a sharp and upright style. The Autumn Garden Infants Playing Map by Su Hanchen and the Flowers and Birds with a Cat in Autumn Garden by a Song painter are all lively and calm. The Painting of Two Monkeys by a Song painter is especially vivid and has the potential to jump down. The willows and boats of the Spring Sail in Willow Creek by Ma Hezhi are elegant and scholarly, and have gradually opened up the style of literati painting in the Song Dynasty. The Ten Scholars of Tang and Five Dynasties by Liu Songnian are well-proportioned and have the ability to take the seat of Longmian. It is a pity that the genuine works of Longmian are not in the exhibition. The West Lake Willow Boat Map by Xia Gui and the Cold Forest Pavilion by a Song painter are both spicy but not domineering, and have the mystery of Lingfei. Zhao Songxue's Small Scroll of Heavy Rivers and Folded Peaks and Qian Shunju's Small Painting of Autumn Melon are both exquisitely beautiful and impeccable. Wu Zhonggui's Double Pine Bamboo and Rocks, Ni Yunlin's Mountain View from the River Bank, and Wang Shuming's Spring Ploughing in Gukou are all better than others with light ink. Zhu Zemin's Listening to Qin under the Forest, Sheng Zizhao's High Scholar in Autumn Forest, and Zhu Mengbian's Resting Geese on the Reed Shoal are all unique secrets of the late Yuan Dynasty, with exquisite and elegant brushstrokes. The mountain road pine sound of Tang Liuru has a clear and refreshing style, the beauty of Qiu Shizhou's Willow Pond Fishing Boat and Autumn River Waiting for Ferry, the ancient and gorgeous style of Wen Xiucheng's Immortals on Yingzhou, the greatness of Dong Xiangguang's Summer Trees Hanging Shade, and the simplicity of Wu Yushan's landscape are all extraordinary works. The Cold Forest Late Show by Ju Ran is suspected to be from the Yuan Dynasty, but the brushwork is unrestrained. Mang Bao's Creek is full of strength and should be preserved by the Song Dynasty. Zhao Chang's Peony, Huizong's White Goose, Cui Bai's Reed Goose, Zhao Zuoju's Ak Pavilion, etc. are all famous paintings by the Academy, which are exhaustive. One picture is an unprecedented masterpiece. The brilliance of the ink treasures of the Four Masters of the Song Dynasty is amazing, and the thin gold script of Emperor Xuanhe's imperial pen is full of spirit and desire to fly. Zhao Wenmin's Seven Machines is especially beautiful. The above are all the supreme treasures in calligraphy and painting. What is regrettable is that the two small paintings by Zhao Yuan and Xu Zhi of the Yuan Dynasty are rare treasures in the literati painting school, and Qiu Shizhou's large painting of Banan Shady Summer is a preliminary selection of goods in our country, but they failed to win the appreciation of British experts. It is also a regret. Other things such as Li Zhaohong's Luoyang Tower Map and Xia Gui's Ten Thousand Miles of Yangtze River Map, which are famous, but the originals are not good. Some know that they are fake, but the imperial inscription is written again and again, saying that they are true, and the imperial cloud is overwhelmed by its seal. Huang Zijiu's Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains and various books of calligraphy from past dynasties have flaws. This proves that Emperor Qianlong's identification and inscription cannot be fully believed. Outsiders only know the importance of Qianlong's imperial inscription, which leads to the loss of true dragons. There are often accumulated habits and misunderstandings, which can be sighed. The history of art in our country is long, and the truth and falsity are mixed together. There is no specialized research institution to make a thorough solution. Only private individuals are seeking, and what they see must not be wide, and there can be no more evidence. Often one or two famous works are relatively long in history and eventually become doubtful cases. This exhibition is open to the public, so that specialized scholars can have more reference for criticism based on the facts. It is beneficial to the history of art in our country. It is hoped that the authorities and gentlemen will widely promote and set up more such art exhibitions, and that the art that has not been extinguished in our country will be revitalized, which is not the luck of world art.</p>
<p>Teng Gu's Thoughts After Viewing</p>
<p>Teng Gu, a counselor of the Executive Yuan and a standing committee member of the Central Antiquities Preservation Committee, came to Shanghai with his wife yesterday to visit the pre-exhibition of the London Chinese Art Exhibition. The reporter met him at the venue and asked for his thoughts after viewing. He said the following: Looking at the exhibits in each department, they are generally very appropriate and in line with modern museum display methods, which is very convenient for viewers. Although there are several museums and exhibition halls in the north and south of our country, in my impression, they are often like a grocery stall and cannot give people a clear and comfortable feeling. This exhibition is far superior to previous exhibitions in terms of display technology, and museums in various places should immediately adopt it. The source of the exhibits is from several important national and provincial institutions, to see the first class of national treasures made by the ancestors, so this exhibition not only provides foreigners with an understanding of Chinese culture, but all Chinese people should also visit to enhance their knowledge of history and art. The state and academic organizations should promote this kind of work so that scholars can compare and study the era of antiquities and the stylistic development of painting. Professors of art history in foreign universities sometimes lead students to museums to teach, and this is the reason. The publicization of academic research is very important in China today, as it can sweep away the old-fashioned appreciation.</p>
<p>Schools Request Visits</p>
<p>In recent days, various schools and academic organizations, such as Qingxin Middle School, Daxia University, Daxia Middle School, Shanghai Business School, Dagong Vocational School, George Practical Vocational School, Shanghai Fine Arts School, Shanghai Municipal Council Chinese School, Shanghai Anhui Junior High School, Shanghai Guanghua University, Guangxia Middle School, Zhenru Experimental School, Chinese Vocational School, Soochow University, MSOC, Chinese Painting Society, Art Production Association, etc., have sent letters to the association requesting preferential visits, dozens every day. However, the association has already established preferential measures for schools and academic art groups, and the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau has made a public announcement. In addition to national schools, which are scheduled directly by the association, the rest are authorized by the Municipal Education Bureau to schedule in order to avoid crowding at the venue, which is a last resort.</p>

The air defense monthly magazine has now been published, focusing on contributions to air defense, so that the public recognizes the significance of air defense. The aviation pictorial is sold over 30,000 copies each time, and subscription requests continue to pour in, which shows the public's attention to the aviation national salvation movement. Regarding the collection of aviation national salvation donations from various industries, the hotel industry, fresh meat industry, and fresh pork sales industry have achieved excellent results. The freight transportation and brick and tile industries that will be mobilized this time have decided to begin collection soon.</p>

<h3>Duan Qirui Appeals for Relief in Anhui</h3>
<p>The Hua Yang Yi Zhen Hui (Chinese and Foreign Relief Association) on Renji Road received a handwritten letter from Mr. Duan Zhiquan yesterday, appealing for help due to the severe drought in Anhui province last year and the ensuing disasters this spring. The letter is excerpted below: "Respected Sirs, our province has suffered from frequent disasters for many years, and its vitality has been lost. Last year, it was ravaged by a severe drought, affecting more than 50 counties and over 9 million people. Now, during the spring famine, the situation is even more dire. Water plants have been exhausted, and grass roots have been dug up completely. Many victims are filling their stomachs with Guanyin clay and rice bran, suffering from bloating and dying. Some are selling their sons and daughters to survive, while others, especially women and the elderly, are killing themselves because they have nowhere to turn. The various tragic scenes are beyond description. If relief is not provided urgently, there will be no survivors. I, Qirui, am old and ill, and although I have the heart to help, I am ashamed of my limited power. I have always admired your association's compassionate care and concern for all people. I humbly request that you show great mercy and allocate a large sum of money to send personnel to provide immediate relief and avert the catastrophe, so that the dying victims can celebrate a new life."</p>
<h3>This Month's Telephone Bill, the Municipal Council Approves Temporary Collection According to the Old Rate...The Increased Amount...Will be Calculated Later</h3>

This request was submitted to the Municipal Council Board of Directors for discussion. According to the General Manager's explanation, the price increase method should have been implemented on April 1st according to the franchise contract. The Board of Directors decided to allow the company to proceed as requested.</p>

<h3>Robbers Caught Sight of an Accomplice, Unwilling to Let Him Go Easily, Forcibly Told the Bailiff, and Immediately Arrested and Tried Him Together</h3>
<p>The robbers Chen Gendi (26 years old, from Ningbo), Qu Jingen (24 years old, from Ningbo), and Wang Qingfang (24 years old, from Ningbo) were arrested for committing crimes in the Public Concession and sentenced to ten years of imprisonment by the First Special District Court. The French Concession police found that Chen and others had also committed robbery in the French Concession, so they requested the Second Special District Court to send police officers to the First Special District Court to transfer the three criminals Chen, Qu, and Wang on Saturday morning of last week. They were temporarily detained in the bailiff's office of the Second Special District Court for questioning and awaiting transfer to the court for detention and investigation. At that time, Gao Aliu, a local ruffian living at No. 29 Glock Road in the French Concession, whose concubine Gao Laosan was arrested for violating private prostitution regulations, was escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court for questioning. Gao arrived at the court that day to collect an audience ticket and entered the court to listen to the trial, waiting for his concubine Gao Laosan to be sentenced to a fine of four yuan. Gao immediately paid the fine and went outside to wait in the courtyard for the receipt to release his concubine and return home with her. Gao was pacing back and forth in the courtyard when he was spotted by the three robbers Chen Gendi and others who were being held in the bail office. They believed that Gao was also an accomplice in the case, who was freely roaming outside without being caught, and did not come to visit or provide food. They felt that he was not loyal enough and wanted to retaliate. Because the door of the bail office was locked and unguarded, and the bailiffs did not respond to their calls, the three of them forcefully knocked on the door. A Western judicial police officer heard the noise and opened the door to inquire. Chen and others pointed to Gao and truthfully reported that he was an accomplice and requested his arrest. The police officer, based on the report, immediately ordered the police to arrest Gao and send him to the police station for detention. Later, the three criminals Chen and others were escorted to the First Criminal Court for detention and investigation and rescheduled for trial on the 19th. Yesterday, the police sent Gao Aliu to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, where Judge Sun Penghan conducted the preliminary hearing. Attorney Fei Xizhen of the police station explained the case and requested a postponement to be combined with the case of Chen Gendi and others for trial. The official briefly questioned Gao and then ordered Gao to be detained and rescheduled for trial with Chen Gendi and others on the 19th.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Society Opens a Rickshaw Pullers Cafeteria, Revises Dormitory Fees, and Proceeds with Preparations for the Nanshi Branch</h3>
<p>The Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Society in this city was recently established and has made considerable progress in various aspects of its work. Recently, it opened a rickshaw pullers' cafeteria, revised dormitory fees, and is proceeding with preparations for the Nanshi branch, gradually completing all planned tasks. The reporter briefly investigated and recorded the following:</p>
<p>Cafeteria</p>
<p>This cafeteria is completely run in accordance with the cafeteria method popular in Europe and America, providing hygienic and nutritious meals at a low cost. Each person chooses their own food and serves themselves, which is convenient for saving money and labor. Diners do not have fixed meal times, and each dish starts from a few copper coins. Meals are purchased with coupons.</p>
<p>Dormitory</p>
<p>This single dormitory is equipped with a copper bed, thick quilt, white sheet, kapok pillow, thick mattress, and storage box. The original dormitory fee was six dimes for a month, two dimes for a week, and ten copper coins for a day. However, since February, those staying for a month or a week have only accounted for one or two percent of the total. It is believed that this is because business is slow, and they claim they cannot afford food. Therefore, to subsidize the expenses of those staying by the day and those staying by the month, the dormitory fee has been reduced from yesterday to 150 copper coins for a month (paid at once) and eight copper coins for a day. Those who stay continuously for 20 days (regardless of the month) will receive 10 days free.</p>
<p>Branch</p>
<p>Rickshaw pullers with registration certificates from the Public Concession who reside in Nanshi account for 34% of the total. They are also important fee-paying members of the association. However, due to the long distance, they cannot fully benefit from the existing association. The entire board of directors of the association decided yesterday that it is necessary to establish a branch there. All construction plans will be jointly discussed by the economic, business, housing, and medical committees to ensure that it can be realized as soon as possible. It is reported that the association's existing temporary branch in West Shanghai was originally planned to be built early, but it was suspended due to unsuitable foundation. However, due to the recent surge in rickshaw pullers coming to the association, it is also planned to relocate and expand.</p>
<h3>Corfan Drug Dazes "Red Sleeves" Continued Trial, Drug has been Retrieved, Ruan Accused Implicates Another Doctor</h3>
<p>Wang Yuxian of the Red Sleeves brothel at No. 31 Huile Lane, Fuzhou Road, was deceived to Room 51-3 of the Yangzi Plate Shop at No. 189 Yunnan Road by a bandit posing as a tax bureau official at around 8 p.m. on the 8th of this month. She was knocked unconscious with Corfan drug, and her face was burned. A gold bracelet and jade ring worth 60 yuan were robbed, and the perpetrators escaped without a trace. Yang Peisheng, the patrol chief of Yulin Road Police Station, and detective Ruan Taibin arrested the criminals Ruan Zilin from Ningbo, Li Jiangguang from Hangzhou, and Lu Jianying from Hangzhou outside Xianmen, Suzhou, on Hengma Road and at No. 62 Xiudeli, Gaoyue Road, Zhabei. A bottle of Corfan drug was confiscated. The gold bracelet and jade ring were found with Lu and Li. The two criminals Lu and Li were detained by the relevant Public Security Bureau, and Ruan Zilin was brought back to the police station and sent to the First Special District Court for detention. Details have been reported in this newspaper. Ruan confessed that the drug was obtained from his friend Dr. Liu Jiaji at No. 12 Xueyuan Lane, Jing'an Temple Road, and that he would give him a considerable benefit after achieving his goal. The case was postponed. The police station issued an arrest warrant to the court and secretly went to the address in the afternoon of the day before yesterday and arrested Liu and brought him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, along with the two criminals Lu and Li transferred from the Public Security Bureau, they were sent to the Criminal Court. Attorney Li Zhishan of the Municipal Council explained the details, stating that Ruan Zilin claimed during the last court hearing that the remaining bottle of Corfan drug used to daze Wang, the prostitute, was thrown into the Suzhou River at the Zidugiao Bridge, which was a lie. In fact, it was discarded in a trash can near the door of a friend at No. 1091 Sanyili, Huasheng Road. Therefore, detectives were dispatched to the area to search and found half a bottle of the drug. However, Ruan suddenly changed his testimony to the police station yesterday, claiming that it was not given to him by Liu, but by Dr. Guo who lived in Jiangwan. This case is requested to be postponed and jointly tried with Ruan. The half bottle of dazing drug found in the trash can was presented for inspection. Lu Jianying testified that he had known Ruan for more than a month. On the afternoon of the 7th of this month, he met Ruan on Diswei Road. Ruan said that he had a bottle of Corfan dazing drug that could be used to daze women for illegal purposes and asked for his help. He agreed to wait at Hongkou Park the next afternoon. At that time, he planned to go with Li Jiangguang to Dadeli, Sichuan Road, to watch a movie. He suddenly thought that Ruan was waiting in the park, so he went to meet him with Li. They then went to the Yangzi Hotel, where Ruan called Wang, the prostitute, to come. At that time, he was alarmed and asked him not to do this, as it was very dangerous. However, he had already taken action. When Wang screamed for help, he was even more flustered and had to press her chest. Afterwards, he and Li fled with her gold bracelet. Li Jiangguang's testimony was evasive, but he admitted that the drug was poured on Wang's face and asked for leniency. Liu Jiaji testified that although he knew Ruan, he had not heard about this matter and did not give him any drugs. Attorney Lu Yanfan Gang defended him. Judge Wu Zehan ruled that he should be detained and rescheduled for a joint trial with Ruan Zilin.</p>
<h3>Schools are Like Markets, with Money as the Standard</h3>
<p>Huang Kangsheng, a 26-year-old from Haimen, graduated from Datong University and taught in Yongkang, Zhejiang. This spring, he was introduced by a Professor Shi from Datong University to work as a geography and history teacher at the Minhua Vocational Middle School at No. 1-7, Lane 160, Yanping Road in Shanghai. At that time, Huang and Cai Xiaohe, the principal of Minhua, agreed that Huang could bring more than 50 students from Yongkang, and his salary should be higher than other teachers. Therefore, Cai agreed to pay Huang a monthly salary of 50 yuan (20 yuan higher than other teachers). However, after the school started, Huang only introduced more than 20 students. The tuition and boarding fees for each semester were 60 yuan. At the time of enrollment, Huang paid 20 yuan on behalf of each student in advance, and the remaining amount would be paid later. Recently, Cai Xiaohe posted a notice urging students to pay because the tuition fees of the students had not been paid in full. Among the students introduced by Huang, Hu Xingcai, Hu Dewen, Zheng Qixiang, Zheng Maofang, Wang Disi, Chen Chengfei, Huang Fuchang, Tong Keren, Zhang Yandan, Zhou Yinhang, Jin Guifang, Lu Yunhuo, and other 12 people saw this notice and said that they had already paid Huang Kangsheng 40, 45, 55 yuan and other amounts when they came to Shanghai, and Huang had promised to pay it to the school on their behalf. They inquired with Principal Cai and learned that Huang had only paid 20 yuan for each person's tuition, and the remaining amount had been embezzled by Huang. The embezzled amount was 315 yuan. Cai believed that this kind of incident had to be investigated and reported it to the Gordon Road Police Station, ordering detectives to arrest Huang the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Attorney Zhang Shizhu of the Police Station explained the case and prosecuted him for fraud under Article 363 of the Criminal Code. Cai Xiaohe then stated that the defendant's salary was originally set at 50 yuan, but because the defendant only introduced more than 20 students, it was reduced by 30 yuan. Hu Xingcai and others also testified that when they arrived in Shanghai, Huang came to the station to meet them and told them that Shanghai was a place of all kinds of evils. As they were unfamiliar with the place, they should give their tuition fees to him to pay to the school on their behalf to prevent them from being stolen. Therefore, they handed over the money. Huang Kangsheng admitted that he had taken the 315 yuan, but claimed that Cai Xiaohe had not paid his salary for two months, and he had told Cai about taking the money. Now he was willing to return the money within two days. Judge Huang Risheng reviewed the testimony and ordered that the case be postponed for further trial, and the defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Two Young Women in Love, One Died and One Injured After Jumping Off a Train, What is Dai Xuetian's Excuse?</h3>
<p>At around 9 a.m. yesterday, when the 22nd upward passenger train on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway was traveling near the fifth kilometer near Zhenru Station, two young women suddenly jumped out of the train in the third-class carriage. One was 21 years old and the other was 17 years old. The older woman's arms and other parts were crushed by the train wheels, and she died on the spot due to severe injuries. The younger woman also fell and was injured all over. It was not until the train arrived at Zhenru Station that the stationmaster reported the incident and urgently telegraphed the North Station to report to the Railway Police Section. The injured person was sent to the Railway Hospital on Bazilu Road for treatment, and the deceased was reported to the court for examination by the local baojia. As for why they jumped off the train, it was learned that the two young women were both daughters-in-law of the Shi family in Suzhou. The older one was Shi Zhou, and the younger one was Shi Yan. They secretly fled to Shanghai last winter and made a living as maids. Soon, they each had lovers and disregarded their husbands in their hometowns. Their families recently learned of their disappearance and negotiated with the women's families. The women's fathers tracked them to Shanghai to find their whereabouts and finally found them. They were being escorted home yesterday morning when the two women, deeply in love, secretly colluded with their lovers. Around 9 a.m. yesterday, the lovers, instructed the women to jump off the train at the fifth kilometer of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway and elope together. The women, disregarding the consequences, acted accordingly, causing the tragedy. The lovers witnessed the tragedy and were stunned. When the police rushed to the scene, they saw him in tears, heartbroken. After questioning him, he stammered and was arrested. After repeated questioning, he confessed the truth and was temporarily detained pending investigation.</p>
<h3>In Yangchang Lane, South Shanghai, Gamblers Stabbed Six Times, Caused by a Five-Yuan Counterfeit Coin, Wang Fuqing's Life in Danger</h3>
<p>A stove shop at No. 54 Shijie, outside Xiaonanmen, is opened by Wu Jinsheng from Rugao. Recently, Wu has privately set up a large-scale gambling den in his stove shop, with all kinds of gambling equipment such as pai gow and dice games. Gamblers flock to it like ants, gambling day and night, and winning a lot of money. At around 11 p.m. the night before last, pai gow was being played in the den when Wang Fuqing from Tongzhou, after losing 20 yuan, suddenly received a five-yuan counterfeit bill and wanted to exchange it. Wu and his son Wu Jiren both denied it, leading to a big argument. Wang was very angry and immediately went outside and said that he would report to the police station and everyone would go to court together. Wu Jinsheng and his son and Sheng Gao, etc. all rushed forward and dragged Wang back in Yangchang Lane, Fushentang Street, to stop him from reporting to the police. Wang insisted on not agreeing. Wu and others then waved their knives and stabbed him wildly. Wang was unable to resist and was stabbed six times in the neck, waist, and other places. The wound on his waist was about an inch deep, and he bled profusely. He collapsed to the ground in extreme pain and lost consciousness. Wu and others knew they had caused trouble and scattered in a panic. Soon, passers-by saw Wang lying in a pool of blood, barely breathing, and immediately reported to the nearby police officer who rushed to the scene to check. Wang was still able to speak and said that he was killed by Wu Jinsheng and his son, who run a stove shop. The police officer then sent the injured person to the hospital for treatment first. Due to excessive blood loss, his life was in danger. He then reported back to the Xundao Street Police Station, which dispatched Police Chief Wang Zuoxian and several police officers to the stove shop at No. 54 Shijie and arrested Wu Jinsheng, Wu Jiren, and the accomplice Sheng Gao and brought them to the station. Police Chief Jin personally interrogated them. As the case involved illegal gambling and knife assault, it was ordered to be sent to the General Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Lin Shao-fang Embezzles a Huge Sum of 60,000 From His Father, Trial Begins, Father Hires a Lawyer to Request Severe Punishment, Bank Unwilling to Intervene</h3>
<p>Lin Shao-fang, a Cantonese man aged 34 and an employee of the check department at the Shanghai Hong Kong National Bank at 348 Jiangxi Road, embezzled a large sum of tens of thousands of yuan that his father had deposited in the bank between August and December 31st of the 18th year of the Republic. He forged bank statements to deceive his father, Lin Yiquan. After the crime was discovered, he fled to Shenyang. His father, together with the bank, reported the matter to the police and hired lawyer Huang Ziping to place advertisements offering rewards for his capture, but to no avail. It wasn't until 4:45 PM on the 7th of this month that Lin Shao-fang, having fallen on hard times abroad and finding it difficult to make a living, returned to Shanghai. While passing by Bazhi Road, he was arrested by Cantonese detective Feng Qi and Chinese constable number 986 of the Hongkou Police Station. He was taken to the police station and then to the First Special District Court. He confessed to using the large sum of money for gold trading, which failed and depleted the funds. He was temporarily detained for further investigation. Later, it was discovered that he had embezzled his father's deposit, totaling 62,106 yuan and 9 cents. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Zehan presided over the trial. Lawyer Li Zhishan of the Municipal Council explained the background, stating that the defendant had been employed by the bank since the 15th year of the Republic, introduced by his father, Lin Yiquan. For the first three years, he was quite reliable, so his father entrusted him to deposit the funds. According to the bank's rules, the depositor's chop and signature were required on the deposit slip, which was then submitted to the accounting department with a voucher. The procedure was rigorous. However, the embezzled funds belonged to his father, and as an employee of the bank, he directly deposited them. Each month, he altered the deposit amount on the bank statements to deceive his father. He is now being prosecuted for forgery and embezzlement. However, given the father-son relationship, and the bank's unwillingness to pursue the matter, the court is requested to consider these factors. Lin Yiquan was not present, but his lawyer, Huang Yuping, stated that the amount embezzled by the defendant was approximately 60,000 yuan, which Lin Yiquan had entrusted to the defendant to deposit into the Hong Kong National Bank in installments. At that time, the defendant was a trainee at the bank. Each time funds were deposited, there were deposit slips signed by senior bank officials as proof. Therefore, the embezzled funds actually belonged to the bank. Moreover, when the incident occurred, the bank reported it to the police and offered a reward of 100 yuan. Police records can attest to this. The former manager of the bank, Mr. Tang, was determined to prosecute the defendant according to the law when he was apprehended. Now that Mr. Tang has left his position, the bank is unwilling to be the plaintiff in this case, which is inexplicable. It should be noted that although the bank's losses due to the defendant's illegal actions have been temporarily compensated by Lin Yiquan as a guarantor, the bank still reserves the right to sue separately. The bank is a British company registered in Hong Kong. The funds that Lin Yiquan used to repay the debt were obtained through mortgage loans. Fortunately, he was able to manage it, otherwise he would have been implicated. Furthermore, Lin Yiquan is nearly seventy years old and does not have much wealth. The embezzled funds were part of his retirement savings. Suffering such a huge loss is extremely painful. The court is requested to impose the appropriate punishment to serve as a warning to young offenders. The defendant admitted that he had embezzled the entire amount as described. He hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him, requesting an acquittal. Judge Wu ruled that he would remain in custody pending sentencing.</p>
<h3>Car Driver Shot Dead, Gatekeeper Arrested, Claims He Accidentally Fired the Gun in a State of Agitation, Deceased's Wife Pitifully Lives Without Support</h3>
<p>Yao Guisheng, a 32-year-old man from Shaoxing, worked as a chauffeur for Mr. Wu Gaoyou, the owner of Lao Xiang Shi at 234 Guangxi Road. At around 11:00 AM on the 13th of this month, he drove his car, number 3836, to the Zhongnan Bank at 110 Hankou Road. Reportedly, he got into an argument with Liu Liangmei (42 years old), a gatekeeper from Jiangxi and constable number 849 at the bank, over parking. Liu then shot Yao twice, both shots hitting vital areas, causing his death. Chinese constable number 2967 of the General Police Station arrested Liu Liangmei at the scene and took him into custody. Detective Li Yidong and detective Bao Xuerui were dispatched to investigate. Yao's body was taken to the morgue on Feilun Road for examination. Details were reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the police first escorted Liu to the First Special District Court's Criminal Division, where police lawyer Wang Yaotang reported the investigation and filed a public prosecution against Liu for murder under Article 282 of the Criminal Code. As the body examination was still pending, a request was made for an adjournment. At around 10:00 AM, prosecutor Guo Wei, appointed by the court's prosecutor's office, along with forensic doctors Wei and Zhang, and clerk Wang Zuyi, arrived at the morgue to examine the body. The police also escorted Liu to the morgue to await questioning. Prosecutor Guo then took the stand and questioned Liu Liangmei, who stated that he lived at 310 Haifang Road and had been working as a gatekeeper at the bank for 14 years. He had never met the deceased before. On that day, he stopped the deceased's car from parking in front of the bank, which led to an argument. The deceased then punched him, causing him to fall to the ground. His gun fell out. As he was picking up the gun and trying to get up, the deceased tried to punch him again. At that moment, he was agitated and confused, so he didn't know how the gun went off. It wasn't until the police arrested him that he realized the deceased had been shot. Yao Zhu's wife stated that she lived at 336 Xiaobeimen. The deceased was her husband, who worked as a chauffeur. She and the defendant were strangers. Her family depended on her husband for their livelihood. Now that he has been killed, how will they survive? She requested justice. Chinese constable number 2967 reported the situation at the time. Prosecutor Guo then declared that the deceased, Yao Guisheng, male, died from a gunshot wound to the abdomen sustained while alive. The perpetrator, Liu Liangmei, should be handed over to the court by the police for further action. The body was handed over to the deceased's wife, Yao Zhu, who signed a receipt for its collection and burial.</p>
<h3>Wu Guangzong's House Robbery Case, Two Robbers Wu and Zhang Executed by Hanging</h3>
<p>Wu Guangzong, the former director of the Hydrographic Survey Bureau of the Ministry of the Navy, resided at 16, Third Lane, Ningkangli, outside the Old West Gate. Around 8:00 AM on September 21st, 1932, four robbers, Wu Jigui, Zhang Shaoliang, Zhang Changlin, and Song Jiande, armed with pistols, suddenly entered Wu's house to rob him. Wu had not yet gotten out of bed. Upon realizing he was being robbed, he immediately jumped out of bed and grabbed one of the robbers, Wu Jigui, refusing to let go. The robber then fired a shot. Zhang Shaoliang, seeing his accomplice being captured, also fired two shots, hitting Wu, who fell to the ground. The robbers then fled. Wu died from his injuries. Subsequently, the Criminal Investigation Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau captured the four robbers one after another and transferred them to the Shanghai District Court. After interrogation, they were sentenced to death. The four convicts appealed to the Jiangsu High Court. The District Court transferred the four robbers to Suzhou. After interrogation, the Jiangsu High Court upheld the death sentences for Wu Jigui and Zhang Shaoliang, while the sentences for Zhang Changlin and Song Jiande were commuted to fifteen years of imprisonment. The sentences were approved by the Provincial Government. At 7:00 AM the day before yesterday, a prosecutor from the High Court went to the prison to carry out the execution by hanging of Wu and Zhang.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Fellow Townsmen Association, Yesterday Welcomed Xiong and Zhou, Tang Haian Gave a Welcoming Speech, Xiong and Zhou Reported on the Recent Situation in Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the Guangdong Fellow Townsmen Association of Shanghai held a meeting at its clubhouse on Gao Naiyi Road to welcome Xiong Shaohao, chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce, and Zhou Shouyu, a member of the standing committee. Over forty people attended, including Tang Haian, Wu Tiecheng (represented by Li Dachao), Xi Guansheng, Zheng Xingguo, Zheng Zhengqiu, Cui Pingxi, Weng Zhiguang, He Wenjiong, Yang Meinan, and Zheng Songyao, all members of the association. Chairman Tang Haian delivered a welcoming speech. Xiong Shaohao and Zhou Shouyu subsequently reported on the recent situation in Guangdong Province and the newspaper industry, respectively. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Tang's Speech</p>
<p>After formal greetings, Tang Haian delivered the welcoming speech, stating that Shanghai is a global commercial area and the cultural center of the country. Over 300,000 people from Guangdong Province reside here, and there are many successful industrialists and businessmen. In recent years, they have been deeply affected by various factors, leading to the organization of the Guangdong Fellow Townsmen Association of Shanghai to connect emotions and unite strength. It is now expanding its membership, hoping to play a greater role in promoting the welfare of our hometown and revitalizing the nation and the people. The positions of Mr. Xiong and Mr. Zhou in Guangdong are well known, and we deeply appreciate their dedication to creating and building Guangdong, promoting industry, and revitalizing commerce. Their great spirit and efforts are admirable. In this era of competition, only the fittest survive. Society can only evolve, and businesses can only advance. Shanghai's relationship is already so great, and the progressive spirit of the people of Guangdong is recognized worldwide. We believe that we cannot be complacent and must strive for progress. The meaning of our meeting today to welcome Mr. Xiong and Mr. Zhou is to connect with our fellow townsmen, share hometown news, and hope that the two gentlemen will use their progressive spirit to introduce more people from our hometown to Shanghai to engage in industry and commerce, so that it can develop day by day. At the same time, we will work together to promote the interests of our hometown.</p>
<p>Xiong's Report</p>
<p>After the Chairman's speech, Mr. Xiong Shaohao reported on the recent situation in Guangdong Province, stating that with the cooperation of the authorities and the people, there has been some progress in security and construction. Regarding security, the Guangdong army has been working hard to suppress bandits, and the bandits have been successively eliminated, ensuring peace in various counties and seeking to complete local autonomy. Regarding the economy, Guangdong's industry and commerce have also been affected by the economic downturn. Recently, the financial community has been willing to step in to maintain stability. Last year, the banking sector maintained 260 shops that were about to close. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the banking sector worked together to maintain 160 shops. The silk industry has declined significantly, and many women have lost their jobs. However, the authorities are now trying to provide relief. Real estate prices in Guangzhou are gradually rising. In 1931, the land price in Changdi was only 1,000 yuan per mu, but now it has risen to 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. Other construction projects in Guangdong are also progressing rapidly, such as the opening of roads and highways, and the construction of an iron bridge connecting the north and south banks of the river. The authorities are also gradually promoting other construction plans.</p>
<p>Zhou's Speech</p>
<p>Zhou Shouyu then reported on the newspaper industry in Guangdong Province, stating that the newspaper industry in Guangdong is developing rapidly. There are dozens of newspapers in Guangzhou alone, and 300 daily newspapers throughout the province. There is also an organization called the Provincial Journalists Association. To train talents in the newspaper industry, it is planned to establish a newspaper college. To understand the foreign newspaper industry, he was sent to the United States for investigation. He will raise funds for the newspaper college and the construction of the Journalists Association clubhouse. At the same time, the journalists in Guangdong have a common hope, which is to establish a National Journalists Association and designate a "Journalist's Day" to make the spirit of the national press more united and seek the development of the newspaper industry. He came to Beijing and Shanghai to contact the press to discuss this matter. Zheng Xingpu, Zheng Xingguo, Zheng Zhengqiu, and Cui Pingxi followed and gave speeches. At 4:00 PM, refreshments were served, photos were taken, and the meeting adjourned. Mr. Xiong Shaohao took a boat to Hong Kong that night to return to Guangdong Province. Mr. Zhou Shouyu took a train to Beijing that night to contact the Central Propaganda Department and the Beijing press about the National Journalists Association. He is scheduled to take the President Coolidge on the 23rd to the United States to study the newspaper industry.</p>

<h3>Russian Man Kicked to Death by Horse</h3>
<p>A Russian man named Grigory Leviev Bareshev (transliteration), 32 years old, worked as a groom in the stable of the fighting-card horse racing association at 38 Daxilu Road. On the morning of the 12th of this month around 8:00 AM, when the Russian man was preparing to wash the hooves of a horse under his care, the horse suddenly became agitated and kicked the Russian man violently, striking him in the abdomen. He was seriously injured and bedridden. In the afternoon, he coughed up a lot of blood. His companions discovered this and sent him to the Russian Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. He died the day before yesterday. Upon receiving the report, the Jing'an Temple Police Station ordered detectives to investigate. The body was taken to the Feilun Road morgue. Yesterday morning, prosecutor Guo Wei, appointed by the First Special District Court, arrived at the morgue to examine the body. After the Western constable Mike Law reported the situation, Guo determined that the deceased, Grigory Leviev Bareshev, a male Russian, died from an abdominal injury sustained while alive. The body was handed over to Bobov, the Russian owner of the stable, who signed a receipt for its collection and burial.</p>
<h3>Young Owner of Yongchang Iron Shop Accused of Adultery by Wife, Requests Divorce and Alimony, Defendant Claims Wife Eloped</h3>
<p>Xu Hongpin, a 22-year-old owner of the Yongchang Weaving Shop on Zikeli Road and a native of Wuxi, married Zhu Yu, a woman from Fangqiao, Wuxi, one year younger than him, on the third day of the first lunar month last year, arranged by his parents and through a matchmaker. Zhu came to Shanghai after the marriage and lived in the iron shop. However, Zhu was originally a country girl. Compared with the modern women in the city, there was a stark contrast. Therefore, Xu did not cherish her very much and often abused her. Recently, Xu and his cousin Yang Fengdi had a romantic relationship and began living together in a rented house at 72 Maigen Road. This made him despise Zhu Yu even more. Zhu Yu had to return to her parents' home in anger. After consulting with her parents, they decided to seek a proper remedy through law. She then hired a lawyer to accuse Xu Hongpin of adultery with his cousin and abandonment of his wife in the First Special District Court, requesting a divorce and demanding alimony of at least 15 yuan per month, from this year until she reaches the age of 60, a total of 7,200 yuan over 40 years. She stated that she is a weak woman with no ability to support herself. Since being abandoned, she has had no means of living. She requested an exemption from the litigation fees. However, Xu Hongpin hired lawyer Wang Peiyuan to file a statement of defense, denying the abuse. He stated that household chores are a woman's duty. Zhu Yu was influenced by bad habits in Shanghai, vainly pursued vanity, and mistakenly regarded housework as a lowly job. She ran away to her hometown with her clothes. Now she falsely accuses him of adultery with his cousin. He requested that the original lawsuit be dismissed and that she be ordered to fulfill her marital obligation of cohabitation. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Qiao Wanxuan summoned both parties for questioning. As further investigation was needed, he adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Leading Pilots, Chinese Can Obtain Three Seats</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Leading Pilots (also known as Tongsha Leading Pilots) have been staffed by foreigners for a long time. There is only one Chinese pilot, Mr. Lin. To recover navigation rights, the government has negotiated and managed to add three Chinese leading pilots. It is reported that yesterday, the Shanghai Shipping Bureau specially invited the chief shipmaster of the Taikoo Company, the chairman of the Leading Pilots Association, and Chen Ganqing, the manager of the Hefeng Company, to review the qualifications of the Chinese leading pilots He Hailan, Wu Jinxiang, and Zhu Zhe at the customs. It is expected that there will be no problems.</p>
<h3>Cotton Merchants Request Increased Cotton Tax, Yarn Association Strenuously Argues Against, Reply to Municipal Chamber of Commerce Letter</h3>
<p>The Chinese Yarn Manufacturers Association recently sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating: "Respectfully replying to your letter number 1947, you stated that cotton merchants intend to request the government to increase import tariffs on foreign cotton and requested us to provide a detailed report on the current situation of our industry for your reference. We are deeply grateful. Our country's cotton production accounts for only one-tenth of the world's total. Therefore, its price fluctuations always follow the rise and fall of American and Indian cotton prices and the rise and fall of foreign exchange rates. Now that the combined price of foreign cotton is low, if we must use tariffs to raise the price, the yarn and cloth produced by yarn factories will be even more difficult to sell due to high costs, and they will inevitably close down one after another. At that time, cotton merchants and cotton farmers will not be able to prosper alone. This is in general terms, and we cannot increase import tariffs just because cotton prices and foreign cotton prices have fallen slightly. First, on July 1st of last year, the import tariff rules were revised, and the tariff on cotton was increased from 3.5 gold units to 5 gold units per 100 kilograms. At the same time, the tariff on cotton cloth was as high as 50%. One bag of spun yarn requires 221 kilograms of cotton, and the tariff is over 11 yuan, equivalent to 22-23 yuan in national currency. Originally, we knew that Chinese yarn factories purchased more domestic cotton, but domestic cotton prices rose with foreign cotton prices, and the heavy tariffs had a greater invisible pull on cotton prices. Manipulators took the opportunity to monopolize and agitate, causing domestic cotton prices to reach a peak of 65 yuan last year when American and Indian cotton prices were at a relatively low level. At the same time, yarn and cloth prices were sluggish due to stagnant sales and the pressure of tax cuts. Under this environment, the spinning industry was bound to be unsustainable, causing factories in Shanghai, Hankou, and Tianjin to first reduce work and then stop work. Recently, Shenxin Factory 7 was sold and Tianjin Yuyuan announced its dissolution. Our industry does not dare to expect to lower cotton prices for its own benefit, but to raise cotton prices to promote the demise of the spinning industry is also not in the interest of the country's economy. This is the second point. After all, Japan does not tax imported cotton, so its spinning costs, even in terms of tariffs alone, are more than 20 yuan lower than Chinese yarn. Therefore, in recent years, in the four northeastern provinces, Hong Kong, Siam, and the South Seas Islands, the sales of yarn and cloth have not only been impossible for Chinese factories to touch, but even Japanese factories in China have found it difficult to promote sales. They have turned to dumping in various ports in the country, resulting in narrower sales of yarn and cloth and a more difficult situation for Chinese factories. This is the third point, and we cannot increase cotton tariffs again in terms of foreign trade. Looking at the inherent value of cotton itself, even with the lowest price of 33 yuan per dan for standard cotton this year, it also fell to 33 yuan and 5 cents in January 1934, which is close to the lowest price this year. The lowest price in 1933 was 27 taels in the old scale, equivalent to 30 yuan and 4 jiao per dan, which is even lower than this year by 3 yuan. Moreover, this year, it fell to 31 yuan and then recently rose to 35 yuan. The current cotton price is not lower than the two most recent years, so there is no need to increase cotton tariffs suddenly as an emergency measure. This is the fourth point. Some say that the fall in cotton prices affects the rural economy. This theory is correct, but if we examine the general price index of agricultural products and compare them, in December 1934, the average number of various rice types was 77.55, the average number of various wheat types was 70.30, beans were 57.00, and the average number of various cotton types was 92.0, which is much higher than rice, wheat, and beans. Even with the recent price drop, it is still not lower than rice and wheat, and it is even higher than beans. In terms of the nature of agricultural products, rice and wheat are the main products, but we have not heard of increasing import taxes on rice and wheat due to the fall in rice and wheat prices. Only cotton, which is relatively less important and has a higher index, needs to have its taxes increased once the price drops to rescue it, which is putting the cart before the horse. Moreover, cotton is an industrial agricultural product, and we must consider the high and low prices of its products, and we should not make one-sided observations. This is the fifth point. Although domestic cotton prices have fallen recently, they are still higher than American and Indian cotton prices. Taking the market price on March 30th as an example, the price of our standard cotton in April was 34 yuan and 4 jiao. On the same day, the spot price of American cotton Middling, which is of a higher grade than standard cotton, was 33 yuan and 6 jiao in New York after conversion to Chinese currency, which is 8 jiao lower. The price of Indian White Broach cotton, which is of a similar grade to standard cotton, was only equivalent to 29 yuan and 46 jiao in Bombay, which is 4 yuan and 6 jiao lower. Therefore, in terms of price, Chinese cotton is not lower than American and Indian cotton, and the living standards of American and Indian cotton farmers and the cost of bridge planting are higher than those of our country. Therefore, compared with international cotton prices, Chinese cotton prices are not too low, and there is no need for special relief. This is the sixth point. Although domestic cotton production has increased greatly in recent years, the sales expenses ratio and the supply are still insufficient. The country's spinning mills use about 9 million dan of cotton annually, and the filling of cases, bedding, and hand-spun yarn uses about 4 million dan, totaling 13 million dan. Even with the 11 million dan of domestic cotton produced last year, we still need to purchase 2 million dan of foreign cotton to balance the supply and demand. Therefore, regardless of whether foreign cotton prices fall or not, if the spinning mills do not greatly reduce their work, they need to purchase a considerable amount of foreign cotton. Recently, American cotton prices have plummeted due to reduced sales, and Indian cotton prices have also weakened. Factories are taking advantage of the opportunity to purchase and store a small amount of the necessary foreign cotton. This is not a dumping of foreign cotton, and it has nothing to do with promoting a surplus of domestic cotton. If we study cotton statistics a little more, we will know that there is nothing strange about it. The cotton merchants are deliberately making sensational claims to scare people. Last year, cotton production increased by more than 1 million dan. If the number of domestic spindles does not increase greatly, no matter how low foreign cotton is, the import of foreign cotton this year must be less than last year. It can be said with certainty that if the purchase volume is higher due to price reasons, it will be reduced soon. The total input will eventually be restricted by the supply and demand statistics. This is the seventh point. The recent fall in cotton prices began at the beginning of the lunar year. The highest price of standard cotton in December 1934 was 37 yuan and 3 jiao and a half. Compared with the lowest price of 33 yuan this year, it has fallen by 4 yuan and 3 jiao. Compared with the recent price of 34 yuan, it has only fallen by 3 yuan and 3 jiao. It cannot be said to be a sharp fall. The cotton merchants' claim that prices have fallen sharply is exaggerated. The drop rate of fine-staple cotton is indeed greater than that of extremely fine cotton. However, this kind of drastic change was actually caused by the cotton merchants themselves. At the time of the new cotton market last year, cotton production increased again, and cotton prices should have fallen as usual. However, the cotton merchants did not understand the domestic cotton production situation and mistakenly believed various unreliable statements. They massively purchased spot cotton, especially in the fine-staple cotton areas of Henan and Shaanxi. As a result, the price of cotton in Shaanxi Province was as high as 56-57 yuan, and with all the expenses from shipping from Shaanxi to Shanghai, it would be 67-68 yuan, which was 4-5 yuan higher than the Shanghai cotton price at that time. Therefore, last winter, cotton prices were affected by cotton merchants' speculative hoarding, and prices rose beyond the norm. After cotton was listed on the market, the quantity did increase, and various unrealistic ideals could not be realized. In addition, foreign cotton fell, and the price drop was more severe than that of benchmark cotton. The losses suffered were also greater. However, this cannot be attributed to the dumping of foreign cotton and the purchase of foreign cotton by yarn factories. This is the eighth point. All the above is true. We have briefly listed the main points and hope you will consider them. The spinning industry is on the verge of danger, and there is no time to repeat them. If we want to increase the import tariffs on raw cotton at this time, it is tantamount to throwing stones down a well and accelerating its demise."</p>
<h3>Facilitating Registration of Construction Bonds</h3>
<p>The construction bonds previously issued by Jiangsu Province have been ordered to be exchanged for water conservancy construction bonds. Bondholders should register with the local county government for exchange. The deadline for registration was stipulated as February 15th of this year. It is now heard that after the registration deadline, many bondholders residing in the countryside or in other places have come to the county government to request registration. Therefore, County Magistrate Pan submitted a request to the Jiangsu Construction Department for facilitation of registration. The Construction Department has instructed the county to facilitate registration for those with special circumstances, register them in a list, and report them. It is not yet known when the new bond certificates will be exchanged, as instructions from the department have not yet been received.</p>

<h3>Mr. Pan Gongzhan's Opinions on Domestic Films Emphasizing the Beautification of Life in Subject Matter and Strictly Cracking Down on Negative Film Reviews</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Central Propaganda Committee attaches great importance to the cultural education related to films. Therefore, it has always spared no effort in guiding and supporting the domestic film industry. It recently convened a second symposium in Shanghai with the heads of various film companies to discuss various issues related to the development of the film industry. The results of the brainstorming session were very satisfactory. It is reported that in the future, in addition to continuing to handle the review of scripts and the inspection of films in accordance with past policies, the Central Government will also crack down on negative film reviews in various publications at any time to correct the public's perception. Mr. Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Education and Youth Bureau of this city, was invited to attend the symposium the other day and expressed his opinions on the spot. He also believed that the crackdown on inferior films was a crucial plan. The following is a supplementary record of Mr. Pan's opinions expressed at the symposium: Since the influx of foreign sound films, China's film market has given domestic films an opportunity for development. However, due to the shortage of capital, China's film companies inevitably face many limitations in the development of domestic films. Therefore, at this time, how we should enable the government authorities and various film companies to cooperate and help each other, and how the companies can help each other and cooperate with each other to promote the development of domestic films is a very important issue at present. There is currently a strange phenomenon, that is, the hopes of the government, the opinions of the press, and the audience's criticisms of films sometimes appear to be very contradictory, even diametrically opposed. This will certainly cause a bad impression on society and make the film merchants confused. Therefore, the products of various companies also appear to be contradictory and disorganized. However, if each film company can identify a common goal, that is, everyone can work hard on the major premise of how to revive the nation, I think it will not be difficult to achieve overall unity. Small differences in some details are not a problem. Secondly, there is a trend in the film industry, which is to tend toward so-called realism, fully exposing social evils, thinking that this is the purpose of film. Then I think there is no need for us to expose all social evils again, because aren't social evils exposed there every day? As long as we all pay attention to observation, don't we all see them? Why must the film go to expose them again? Moreover, the shadow cast on society by this so-called exposure of social evils is very huge and can easily induce the general public to tend to the dark side. Many criminal acts were originally unknown to the general public, but because they were fully exposed in the film, the result is tantamount to telling people various methods of how to commit crimes. Therefore, the correct purpose of film is not to expose, but to instruct. Art is not only about depicting facts, but should express facts in another wonderful way. It is definitely not just acting out a fact and then being done with it. Therefore, the purpose of film should be to guide people to a higher life with the concept of beautifying life. Again, there is also a bad phenomenon in the film industry, which is the idea of ​​blindly believing in others and worshiping foreign countries. We should reform this. We must never think that what others think is good should also be considered good and right by ourselves. We must never take the path taken by other countries and apply it to China. Soviet Russia is indeed a socialist country, but isn't the Three Principles of the People also socialism? We are practicing socialism when we implement the Three Principles of the People. The so-called socialism of other countries is not suitable for China's national conditions. However, now in the Chinese film industry, everyone thinks that only things from Soviet Russia are socialist. This is a very big mistake. Therefore, the reason for creating this kind of wrong atmosphere is not the voluntary wish of the film company or the actors. It is really a group of boring literati who use the tool of film criticism to threaten those who do not agree with their line. When Mei Lanfang went to the United States before, he was attacked beyond recognition by a group of so-called left-wing writers. But this time Mei Lanfang went to Soviet Russia, why didn't this group of people say a word? This is so absurd, so we believe that if the Central Government wants the film to have a correct development, it must first start by eliminating this bad phenomenon. We hope that the Central Government will take a fair and selfless attitude to eliminate this bad phenomenon and severely crack down on negative film reviews.</p>
<h3>Important Notice from the National Products Grand Alliance</h3>
<p>The National Products Grand Alliance Committee, in order to implement relief through the appropriation of funds from the Ministry of Finance, and in accordance with discussions to prepare tables to investigate the economy of national product factories for the purpose of adjustment, issued an important notice to various factories yesterday, saying: "Regarding the matter of the notice, it is found that this association is the general group composed of the China National Products Maintenance Association, the Shanghai Citizens' National Products Promotion Association, the Shanghai National Products Factory Federation, and the Shanghai Machine-Made National Products Factory Federation, with the purpose of relieving national product factories. In this autumn of extremely difficult social economy, the factory's need for relief is especially urgent. Now that the two urgent plans decided by the China Industrial and Commercial Relief Association have been presented to Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance for approval and instructed to handle, now the first plan, that is, 5 million in small credit loans, and the second plan, that is, 10 million in loans secured by goods and factory foundations, will be implemented. However, in order to investigate the difficult situation of the affiliated factories and the need for state relief funds, it is urgent to conduct an investigation. Therefore, a questionnaire is specially prepared, distributed to all factories, to be filled out in detail, in order to implement adjustments and achieve consistent cooperation. It concerns the vital interests of the factory, so please do not delay. This is an important notice."</p>
<h3>National Products Production and Sales Joint Market Organized by China National Products Production and Sales Joint Company, etc.</h3>
<p>The China National Products Production and Sales Joint Company, in view of the dumping of foreign goods in recent years and the increasing trade deficit, believes that industrial recovery and economic prosperity cannot be achieved without the unity, mutual assistance, and struggle of financial and industrial groups. Therefore, it has specially united more than 100 national product factories in this city to organize a China National Products Production and Sales Joint Market on the second floor of the Ningbo Bank Building at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Shanxi Road in Shanghai. It is now actively proceeding with the purpose of promoting national products and adjusting trade, and a banking group organized by Ningbo Industrial Bank and other four banks will undertake the current cash for activities. It is heard that the organization of the market first solicits representatives from various factories to form a production committee, and invites committee members from the National Products Promotion Association organized by various trade associations to form a sales committee to jointly study the improvement of products, the uniformity of wholesale and retail prices, the development of foreign trade, the study of tax rates, the submission to the government, the regulations for the implementation of anti-dumping taxes and incentive taxes, and the assistance of financial unification. Then the domestic and foreign trade has a centralized market, which can not only facilitate trade and save expenses, but also enable the flow of goods and the adjustment of finance.</p>

<h3>Lin Kanghou Talks About New Ways of Investing in Real Estate The New Village Investment Method Is Still Proper and Conducive to the Development of Urban and Rural Areas</h3>
<p>Since the China New Village Construction and Investment Cooperative in this city advocated the cooperation and investment of new village real estate, people from all walks of life have praised it and rushed to inquire about the method. Yesterday, Mr. Lin Kanghou expressed his opinion on this matter, saying that he himself is one of the fund custody committee members of the cooperative and is more clear about the handling situation. The cooperative's innovative system of new village real estate cooperation and investment solves the contradiction between no houses for people to rent and no houses for people to live in. On the one hand, it opens up a safe way out for those who invest in real estate, and on the other hand, it provides a fresh living base for citizens. The method is that the investor hands over the funds to the bank designated by the custody committee, and the cooperative builds houses for the residents who have identified them in the new village construction site. After the completion and handover, the investor collects rent and interest, and the cooperative guarantees vacant rent. The intention is very good, and the method is also based on rationality. It is a new way of investing in real estate. The total amount of the first phase of new village real estate cooperation and investment of the cooperative is tentatively set at 500,000 yuan in national currency. The types of investment are divided into two types: arbitrary investment and whole house investment. The former does not have a fixed investment amount, and the latter is limited to housing at most. I believe that if this new system can be promoted in urban areas across the country, it will not only be extremely related to the issue of the outlet for investors, but also affect the financial stagnation in cities. In recent years, the interior has become more and more difficult, and after cash is concentrated in cities, investment in the interior lacks security, so urban cash flows out of the country again. If there is still no safe way to invest in the future, the future will be unimaginable. In today's cramped state of cities, the cooperative's announcement of new village real estate cooperation and investment has a profound meaning in rescuing urban prosperity and rural areas. The construction of new villages is an operation that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. If the people living in cities today can do their best to support the construction of new villages, then the urbanization of urban areas and the urbanization of rural areas can be quickly successful through concerted cooperation. If this is the case, from the perspective of rescuing the Shanghai market today, it is felt that the stagnant funds of citizens can obtain a stable use. At the same time, from the perspective of rescuing rural areas, it is also the only plan to develop production undertakings.</p>

<h3>Jiangnan Volleyball League Champion Suffers Loss: Fudan Unexpectedly Defeated by Nankai (Nanmin) Yesterday, with a Spectacular Performance Ending at 3-2; Nanmin's Final Battle Against Hujiang Today</h3>
<p>Fudan University's volleyball team, the Jiangnan volleyball league champion for over a decade, unexpectedly lost to Nankai University's (Nanmin) team, the North China champion, with a score of 2-3. This is truly an astonishing result in the volleyball world. Yesterday at 3 PM, the two teams met at the Jiangwan Fudan court. In addition to Far Eastern star Qiu Guangxie, Fudan also temporarily added the capable forward Xu Heng to fill in. The lineup was quite strong. However, due to a lack of practice, poor coordination, and defensive negligence, they were exploited by the northern team. Nanmin's players were well-rounded, with excellent ball-saving skills and fierce attacks. The performance of both sides was extraordinarily brilliant. The more than 500 spectators in attendance were all delighted, marveling at the spectacle. Today is the final battle of Nanmin's Shanghai tour, against Hujiang, at the Hujiang field in Yangshupu. The details of yesterday's battle are as follows:</p>
<p>Stealing the Show</p>
<p>Nanmin scored a point immediately after the serve, but Fudan quickly returned the favor, taking the lead with 2-1. After that, the situation changed dramatically. Nanmin's forwards used swift and sharp spikes, scoring six consecutive points, from 2-2 to 8-3. Fudan then desperately chased, cautiously and carefully, and in an instant, made it 18-16, with a difference of only two points. However, Nanmin's first-line players, Wang and Liu, again unleashed their lightning-fast spikes, making it impossible for Fudan to parry. They easily won the first set with a score of 21-16.</p>
<p>Continuing the Momentum</p>
<p>After the serve, Nanmin took advantage of their momentum and launched a fierce attack, scoring point after point, and the score soared to 7-6, 8-6, and 8-7. Fudan then launched a fierce attack, tying the score at 8-8. Qiu Guangxie jumped up for a powerful spike, taking the lead with 9-8. But Nanmin again showed their ferocity, going from 10-10 to 11-10. After switching sides, Nanmin had smooth sailing, winning the second set with a score of 21-15.</p>
<p>Successful Counterattack</p>
<p>Fudan, having lost a set, was not discouraged. The entire team bravely attacked. The battle was exceptionally exciting. After Fudan's serve, the Dongda player Qiu Guangxie displayed his excellent skills, and with his iron arm, Nanmin was completely defeated. As a result, Nanmin's line was thrown into a state of chaos. In an instant, Fudan took the lead from 17-16. After the momentum had shifted, Fudan then...reclaimed one set.</p>
<p>Tying the Score</p>
<p>Fudan veteran Xu Ting arrived just in time and joined the battle, replacing Zhou Jieming, the central player in the front row. Xu was confident and full of smiles, and was able to turn the tide, winning a lot of applause from the audience. The score rose rapidly, from 2-0 to 21-10. The score remained consistently ahead, creating a tie of 2-2.</p>
<p>Securing the Victory</p>
<p>With the situation tied, both sides gave their all in attack. The battle became even more tense. Both sides' offense and defense were remarkably skilled. Nanmin's serves were fierce, while Fudan's front row players were all masters of spiking. With one attack and one defense, the score was close, from 1-1, 8-8, to 18-18, and 19-19. At this moment, the tension was extreme, and the surrounding audience applauded and cheered enthusiastically. Nanmin's Liu Zhicong scored a point with a serve, and Fudan's Xu Heng countered with a spike, also scoring a point. The two sides tied again at 20-20. Nanmin's Wang Shaocheng scored two consecutive points, finally securing the victory with a score of 22-20.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Orders Prompt Handling of Teacher Certification for Middle Schools and Normal Schools; Summer Training Courses for Elementary School Teachers to Continue This Year; Summer Training Courses for Middle School Science Teachers to Add History, Geography, and English Classes</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 15th dispatch) The Ministry of Education ordered the provincial and municipal education departments to report on the implementation of the "Provisional Regulations for Teacher Certification for Middle Schools and Normal Schools," which were issued in July of last year. According to reports from Ministry personnel who inspected the situation, only a few provinces and cities have followed the regulations to conduct the previous teacher certification. There are still teachers in various schools who do not meet the qualifications stipulated in the regulations. These various phenomena are sufficient to affect the progress of secondary education. It is appropriate to correct this situation immediately. The provincial education departments are ordered to immediately report on the status of the aforementioned teacher certification. Those who have not yet conducted the certification should immediately prepare to organize a certification committee and report on compliance within 20 days of receiving this document. The summer training courses for elementary school teachers held by the provincial education departments last year were able to meet local needs and were conducted earnestly. They have been effective in encouraging elementary school teachers to continue their education and improve teaching efficiency. As this academic year is coming to an end, the provincial education departments are still ordered to continue holding summer training courses for elementary school teachers this year. In addition to complying with the points in the Ministry's Order No. 4121 from last year, the "School Health" subject should be added in accordance with the Ministry's Order No. 1093 this year. The provincial education departments are to submit detailed and concrete plans for holding this year's summer training courses for elementary school teachers before the end of May. In order to provide opportunities for middle school teachers to continue their education, the Ministry designated public and private universities to hold summer training courses for middle school science teachers last summer vacation, and gathered science teachers from various schools to participate separately. In addition to continuing to hold science teacher training courses this year, history, geography, English, and other subjects will be added. Secondary schools under the jurisdiction of the provincial education departments should ensure that a considerable number of teachers participate in the summer training courses, with the exception of science teachers who participated in the courses last year, whose participation this year will be voluntary. The period for the summer training courses is three years, so that all teachers in each subject will have at least one opportunity to participate in order to emphasize continuing education. The designated universities and the subjects they will offer are listed in the attached order. The provincial education departments are to immediately inform all schools under their jurisdiction to comply with the order, designate teachers to participate in the training courses, and submit to the Ministry a detailed report on the number of participants from each school in each province and the subjects and universities they plan to attend by May 15. The designated universities and the subjects they will offer are as follows: (1) Central University, Beiping University, Normal University, Wuhan University, Sun Yat-sen University, Zhejiang University, Sichuan University, and Xiamen University will offer four subjects: geography, history, English, and science. (2) Tsinghua University, Central China University, Jinling University, and Datong University will offer two subjects: English and science.

<h3>Mayor Wu's Speech: Cultural Construction and the Reading Movement; Today at 3:15 PM, Sino-British Radio Station; Zhang Yuanruo to Lecture on How to Study Law</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the eighth day of the National Reading Movement Conference, organized by the China Cultural Construction Association. The association specially invited Mayor Wu to give a speech on cultural construction and the reading movement on the radio. Today at [blank space] o'clock in the afternoon, Shanghai Municipal Government Secretary Zhang Yuanruo will also lecture on how to study law at the Sino-British Radio Station. A reporter from the Shanghai News Agency recorded the full text of Mayor Wu's speech as follows:</p>
<p>The Construction Phase</p>
<p>Today, I am honored to be invited by the China Cultural Construction Association to give a speech on the National Reading Movement Conference. I would like to use the two topics of "Cultural Construction and the Reading Movement" to explain the significance of the China Cultural Construction Association's organization of the National Reading Movement Conference. We must know that the Chinese revolutionary movement has progressed to a new stage with the objective needs of space and time. The characteristic of this new stage is construction. Only construction can realize the ideals of the revolution, only construction can relieve the suffering of the people, only construction can enrich the strength of the country, and only construction can strive for the revival of the nation. We must also be clear that Chinese society has now reached an epoch-making stage of transition, with the old and new intermingling and metabolism rapidly changing. The new phenomena presented before us are also the current new problems, which cannot be solved by traditional knowledge or biased prejudices, nor can they be solved by emotional impulses or violent behavior. The most urgent task at this time is to draw up plans for construction, enrich the capacity for construction, and, in particular, fully cultivate the people's intellectual abilities and universally improve the people's level of education and cultural standards. This task is like the foundation of a great building. The more thorough it is, the greater it will become. It must not be rushed or neglected because of its difficulty.</p>
<p>Sustained Effort</p>
<p>Past reformers, social activists, and even many cultural activists seem to have not paid attention to this point. Therefore, although various movements in the past have been vigorous and have once generated the driving force of the times, this driving force of the times has subsided with the passage of time, and the vast majority of the people, in particular, have not been prepared to bear this force. Therefore, the formal development of all movements has no foundation to rely on, and the ideals of all movements have a huge gap from the intellectual level of the vast majority of the people, and even have the great danger of running in opposite directions. This is the general cause of why all movements in the past have failed to achieve results. The China Cultural Construction Association has deeply understood this historical lesson, recognized the needs of the current era, established the grand [blank space] of "Cultural Construction," and is working in a down-to-earth manner along the necessary stage of social evolution to carry out the basic work of enriching national strength and reviving the nation. This cultural movement not only bears a major historical mission, but also has the important significance of dividing the times.</p>
<p>The Significance of Reading</p>
<p>However, cultural construction is not a novel term, not an empty slogan, but a practical work. At the same time, cultural construction is not the ideal of a few people, not the work of a few people, but the responsibility that the vast majority of the people should share together, and only when it is shared by the masses can it have its practical significance. In this sense, in this relationship, the reading movement is not only a necessary prelude to the entire cultural construction movement, but also the most basic and most essential work to complete cultural construction. Therefore, the important mission of the reading movement is to improve the level of culture, and with the improvement of the level of culture, the achievements of cultural construction can naturally be concretely and universally manifested. Therefore, we can also say that cultural construction is indeed our basic work for enriching national strength and reviving the nation in the future, but how to build culture, in China, where the people are ignorant and illiterate, we must take the reading movement as the preliminary work to complete this major mission.</p>
<p>The Basis for Revival</p>
<p>The general public only knows to admire the development of modern European academic culture, but they do not know that a hundred years ago, the knowledge and social conditions of their people were no better than ours. The reason why they have made rapid progress and become the source of modern world culture, and the reason why their social conditions, people's level, and lifestyles have made great progress, is nothing more than the result of their concerted and universal efforts to improve their knowledge. The Meiji Restoration of Japan arose at the same time as ours, and the level of culture of the Japanese people themselves was far superior to ours. However, after only decades of effort, they have been able to shine in the modern world of science and culture, which is also the result of their efforts to seek knowledge. From the above history of China and various countries in the East and West, we can obtain a principle of national prosperity and decline. The struggle of modern nations is not a simple struggle of military force, but a struggle of intelligence, a struggle of science, and a struggle of culture. If we want to revive, to become strong, and to struggle from such a backward situation to attain a truly free and equal position, then we must follow this historical principle, unite from top to bottom, and everyone seek progress in knowledge, create the foundation of our national culture and science, and on this foundation, seek self-improvement, seek revival, seek national equality, and seek national development, then we will have certainty and reality. In short, if we want to revive the nation, we must build the nation's culture, cultivate the nation's intelligence, and improve the level of culture. This is the significance of the China Cultural Construction Association's promotion of the National Reading Movement Conference. The end.</p>

<h3>Finance: Silver Issues Favor Shorts; Spot Gold Plunges Uncontrollably; A Drastic Drop of 35.3 Yuan; Lowest at 803 Yuan; Extremely Chaotic Trading on the Floor; Both Short Covering and Long Liquidation Occur</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was affected by the news that Song Ziwen had met with various Chinese and foreign banks in Shanghai to discuss the silver issue. According to the content published in the Jiangnan Zheng Bao, it was favorable to the sellers, resulting in a sharp increase in bank selling and a drastic decline in the exchange rate, once falling to a low of 803 yuan. Finally, the exchange rate tightened slightly and stabilized. In the early morning, the overseas silver market was flat, the forward silver price narrowed slightly, and the exchange rate fluctuated slightly. The London raw gold rose by one and a half pence. People were unable to cheer up because of the news that Song Ziwen had convened the banking industry in Shanghai to discuss the silver issue yesterday, and the result was mutual cooperation to raise China's silver price to be close to that of foreign countries (as recorded in Japanese newspapers). The sellers gathered, and the outer reserve transaction opened, immediately retreating from 44.45 yuan to 35.36 yuan. The People's Bank of China's listing was announced, with both British gold flat and the customs gold unit rising by one cent. The standard spot gold price was 872 yuan and then slightly stabilized. After opening, the exchange rate was loose and lacked support, and the banks were all selling, falling into the 30 yuan range. Chinese merchants seized the opportunity to buy cheaply. HSBC's listing was announced, with British gold flat and American gold rising by only 0.0625. People's minds were still stable, and large households forcefully covered, once rebounding. However, because the bank's appetite was still blocked and the silver balance tax announcement had not changed, it retreated into the 30 yuan range. After this, the bank's selling was extremely strong. Jewish merchant George Joseph took the opportunity to violently sell, the domestic market became extremely hard, and the sellers repeatedly acted, the multi-party camp collapsed, the selling pressure became stronger, and the important thresholds of 20 and 10 yuan were repeatedly broken. The noon close was low and slightly stable. In the afternoon market, Indian silver rebounded by Xiao Jiuanna, and the outer wound immediately rose to 15.16 yuan. After opening, the exchange rate was still inconsistent, and Jiaotong, George Joseph, and Sassoon successively dumped, the domestic market became even harder, and the 10 yuan threshold was broken again, once falling to a new low price of 803 yuan. After entering, the bank took the opportunity to buy cheaply, and the buyers began to act, gradually rising back to outside 10 yuan. Although there was an increase, because large short positions increased, there was a lot of struggle, and the exchange rate gradually tightened again. After this, demand exceeded supply, once approaching the 20 yuan threshold. The Guangdong gang sold strips, and Indian silver rebounded twice, growing by five Anna and going downstream. The closing price was flat, and the trend after the close seemed good. The rise and fall during the day was extremely huge. Both large households covered short positions and liquidated long positions. Moreover, due to swap relations, the situation was extremely chaotic. Yesterday, the swap was posted by the multi-party at a weakness of 2 yuan to 5 yuan. The day's market conditions are recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 836 yuan, down 12.6 yuan from the previous close. Heng Yu, Fu Yi, Fu Xing, and Yong Jin were at 7 yuan. The May forward shilling was difficult to sell at 1.875. Heng Yu, Ying Xiang, Hui Xiang, and Wan Xing sold strips, retreating to 1 yuan. Da De Cheng, Heng Yu, and Yi Cheng advanced to 4 yuan. Huabi Sai's June forward shilling was 25.

Hui Xiang and Heng Yu Chang Da got rid of, retreating to 30 yuan. Rui Xing, Da Fa, and Yong Yuan took advantage of the low price to advance to 3 yuan. Fu Yu, Yuan Mao, and Yong Chun Yuan took advantage of the situation to sell, gradually falling to 29.6 yuan. Preliminary knowledge of HSBC's license plate, British flat and American rose 0.0625, people's hearts are still good.

<h3>Rumors of Cooperation to Increase Silver Prices: Foreign Exchange Struggles to Hold Steady, British Nearly Eight Pence, American Forty Yuan</h3>
<p>According to foreign dispatches yesterday, London large bars closed近平而遠縮〇六三五, New York silver prices remained unchanged, Monte Carlo forward silver market retreated three to seven and a half percent, London raw gold rose one and a half pence, British fell one two five against American, American rose two five against British, British fell eight pounds against French, American shrunk one cent against French. The foreign exchange market opened with near-term sell prices: British exchange at one shilling seven pence one eight seven five, American exchange at thirty-eight yuan seventy-five. Compared to last Saturday's noon closing, British was down zero six two five, American was up one two five. Central Bank's listed rates were announced, British and American both flat, customs gold unit rose one cent, without much impact. Public sentiment was dampened by news of cooperation among banking circles to raise China's silver prices closer to international levels, causing prices to harden immediately after opening. However, with the announcement of HSBC's listed rates, British remained flat and American rose only 〇六二五. Chinese merchants took advantage of the low prices to buy, but the silver equalization tax remained unchanged, and prices remained firm. Later, the appetite of Chinese merchants waned, and rumors spread. Banks and Jewish merchants, including 喬直甫, repeatedly exerted efforts to sell, creating oversupply. The market trend thus consistently loosened, with British exchange nearing eight pence and American exchange exceeding forty yuan. Noon closing was slightly stable. The market tightened afterward due to a decline of nine annas in Indian silver. However, after the outflow of funds from 交通, 沙遜, and 喬直甫, the market became loose again. Later, banks took advantage of low prices to buy, gradually tightening the market. In the afternoon, the market briefly tightened, and Indian silver rebounded by five annas in a second surge, although it had little impact. However, 喬其甫 and others continued to sell. Finally, the market leveled off slightly. The closing price for near-term sales was British exchange at one shilling seven pence six eight seven five, American exchange at thirty-nine yuan seventy-five. Compared to last Saturday, British was down five six two five, American was up one yuan one two five. Merchants and speculators alternately bought and sold, and banks' buying and selling were inconsistent. However, Chinese brokers sold a considerable amount of shillings.

<h3>Securities: Public Bonds Hover with a Weary Tone</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the market remained unchanged. Large investors' buying and selling seemed to have started slightly, but buyers were unwilling to raise prices, and sellers were unwilling to lower them. The lines were extremely tight, showing no signs of wavering. Such a stalemate has lasted for a long time. If the environment changes slightly, and the defenses waver even a little, there is a risk of collapse. This is because the amounts deposited by both the bulls and the bears are accumulating more and more. The only hope of the bulls, the British pound loan, remains elusive. On the other hand, the soaring silver price is causing the outflow of tangible and intangible silver, which cannot be stopped. The commercial market feels increasingly critical, and there is a lack of effective remedies. The prospects are not optimistic. Yesterday's trading was mostly hovering with a weary tone, and the afternoon situation was especially sluggish. Large investors bought quite a bit of the 16th and 49th issues and sold quite a bit of the 4th, 20th and 46th issues. The market maintained its stance, with little difference between the sides. In the end, except for a slight increase of 5 fen for the current month's consolidation, other issues fell slightly by 5 fen to 1 or 2 jiao. The total transaction volume was 8,415,000 yuan. The increases and decreases are listed in the table below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn: Cotton Yarn Hit by the Gold Rush, Sudden Decline Gradually Stabilizes</h3>
<p>The yarn market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon, with a fickle market sentiment. The sharp fall in the gold market caused panic. Fortunately, the spot yarn sales market remained sustainable, and customer demand was strong, making the spot yarn situation very good. Most of the major bulls remained calm, but the market turned down in the afternoon due to the impact of the gold rush.</p>
<p>Gold Chicken Rose in Morning and Fell in Afternoon</p>
<p>For standard yarn, the market price for each month continued to be good in the morning session. Due to the rise in foreign cotton and the decent spot yarn sales market, floating positions were covered, resulting in each month rising by 1, 3, and 4 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. The market situation suddenly changed when the afternoon session opened, and the situation became very weak. Sellers in the market had a lot of inventory. It was heard that the gold price had fallen to a low of 803 yuan, and there were rumors that short positions were threatening to close out, so there were many who were closing out. Each month fell by 6, 7, 8, and 9 jiao. The market stabilized and remained unchanged after about two or three rounds of trading. However, there were still over 1,000 bales of spot yarn being traded by the customer groups. A certain bull still did not trade, and the bull's position remained unmoved. As a result, each month fell by 6, 7, and 9 jiao to 1 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that 大豐 sold 500 bales, 賡豐 1,550 bales, 潤康 1,350 bales, 達記 1,300 bales, 瑞大 600 bales, and 均昶 600 bales, 長豐 400 bales. 穗隆 bought 350 bales, 益大 550 bales, 振大 400 bales, 昶記 1,150 bales, 長豐 1,250 bales, 信誠 450 bales, 生源 450 bales, 大昶 300 bales, and 仁豐 300 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for each day are listed below:</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Change Inventory</p>
<p>April 183.3 182.3 182.3 Down 0.90 33,200</p>

<p>September 182.8 181.7 181.8 0.90 11,150</p>
<p>Total 212,300</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Customer Sales Still Have Over 1,000 Bales</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales were still good. It was found that a total of 1,123 bales were bought by various groups throughout the day, similar to the previous day. The purchase amounts for each group are listed below:</p>
<p>Guangdong 215 Ningbo 8 Inland 75 Sichuan 25</p>
<p>Changsha 305 Tianjin 150 Luzhou 10 Nanjing 5</p>
<p>Northern Group 5 Counterparts 75 Jiangxi 35 Xuzhou 10</p>
<p>Yunnan 75 Shantou 15 Wuhu 5</p>
<p>The cotton market started to rise and then fell, but American and Indian cotton continued to rise unabated. However, the sharp fall in the gold market and the rise in exchange rates disappointed the bulls, and the market showed signs of softening. As for the spot cotton sales market, it is gradually developing, and factory demand is relatively smooth. According to industry insiders, the Cotton Inspection Office has not yet received any news of ample deliveries for the current month.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Bull Still Calm</p>
<p>The market for standard cotton opened with each month showing an upward trend. American cotton rose by another 15 pounds, and Indian cotton rose by 3 rupees. However, the gold market fell back by more than 10 yuan, and the equalization tax remained unchanged. The market participants were not very panicked, and because there were not many deliveries this month, the market was tight. On the previous day, it was reported that the banking industry had requested an increase in the import tax on foreign cotton, so the market lacked supply. As a result, each month rose by 1 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. The market situation changed drastically when the afternoon session opened, and there was a sudden panic like a typhoon. The selling pressure was heavy because the standard gold price plummeted, reaching a low of 803 yuan. For a time, people were in a panic, and many floating positions were closed out. Each month fell by 3 jiao uniformly. 長豐 came to throw out more than 6,000 dan. However, it was found that other sales were not very enthusiastic, so the bull side remained calm. The future situation is still in chaos because the trends of gold and silver are so turbulent that the market lacks confidence. As a result, each month fell by 3.5 jiao to 3 jiao compared to the morning closing price, but this month only fell by 1 jiao. It was found that 大豐 sold 2,700 dan, 合興 5,600 according to, 潤康 5,900 dan, 大昶 3,600 dan, 生源 1,300 dan, 長和 4,400 dan, 長豐 6,300 dan, and 瑞大 1,300 dan. 吉豐 bought 1,000 dan, 賡豐 2,000 dan, 仁豐 1,100 dan, 同興 2,700 dan, 長豐 4,500 dan, 同和 1,500 dan, 新亨 1,500 dan, 源大 3,800 dan, 永昌 2,500 dan, and 信誠 1,500 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for each day are listed below:</p>

<h3>Grains: Flour and Wheat Increased Sharply Before Stabilizing, Increased Due to Tax Increase... Decreased Slightly with Gold Price - Result Still Higher Than Previous Day</h3>
<p>In the flour market, after the opening of the market in the morning, the market prices for each month showed a trend of rising rapidly first and then stabilizing. The quotations for foreign wheat were very volatile, with Chicago only at about 48 points, and Canada had fluctuations of 4 points back and forth. When the market opened, there were telegrams about the addition of tax on foreign wheat, so both inside and outside the industry paid attention. The near-term bidding price was a little higher, and the far-term market was extremely high, with prices being raised crazily, such as August to 4 jiao 4.5 fen, and September to 4 jiao 6 fen, which was a huge increase of 4 or 5 fen compared to the previous week. However, after this surge, the price gradually fell back, because the gold price plummeted, and the foreign exchange market rose sharply. Therefore, the selling force also became very smooth, and the multi-party felt powerless, so the market fell back by 2 or 3 fen. When the afternoon market opened, transactions had turned light, and the market was hovering. The reason was that the tax increase had not yet materialized, and the rise and fall of gold prices were unpredictable. Both sides were mostly watching, and the market price also tended to be stable. As a result, the current month rose by 1 fen and 2.5 li, May rose by 1 fen and 1.5 li, June rose by 2 fen and 2.5 li, July rose by 2.5 fen, August rose by 2 fen and 1.5 li, and September rose by 2 fen and 7.5 li.</p>
<p>The wheat market in each month showed a stable and strong trend. Although the quotations for foreign wheat were only about 48 points in Chicago, and Canada had fluctuations of 4 points up and down, when the market opened, due to the talk of tax increases on foreign wheat, people in the industry were naturally excited. The near-term was because the supply of chips had not started, and the far-term bidding price was 3 or 5 fen higher, and then continued to be 1 or 3 fen higher. Then, with the sharp fall in gold prices, the flour market also went high and then low, and gradually turned calm again. When the afternoon market opened, the unopened months were because the current wheat section was expensive, and the opening price was 5 fen higher. The far-term transactions were quieter, and the market had a slight loosening. After observation, if the foreign exchange market changes greatly, the wheat price may also be driven. As a result, the current month was 5 fen higher, July was 5 fen higher, and August was 1 fen higher. The current wheat market is still rising, because the inventory in the market is not abundant, and customers are gradually raising prices, with mid-range goods being 2 or 3 fen higher and high-quality goods being 3 or 5 fen higher. Judging from the inventory, there is still a sign of price increases. Opening Shandong Bengbu high wheat was 4 yuan, Luohe wheat was 3 yuan and 9 jiao 6 fen, Liuhe and other Yan wheat was 3 yuan and 9 jiao half, Xishi wheat was 3 yuan and 9 jiao 4 fen, and Hankou wheat was 3 yuan and 7 jiao 3 fen, from Fuxin went 5,000 bags, and Fufeng went 1,600 bags.</p>

<h3>Over 50,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Traded, All Types of Rice Including Dujing Also Increased</h3>
<p>Foreign Rice</p>
<p>Was quite lively. The producing areas, such as Saigon, Siam, and Myanmar, all reported price increases. The market participants were already looking at the market favorably, and yesterday there were rumors of tax increases. The buying interest from inland areas was even more enthusiastic, and various groups from Zhejiang and other inland areas unanimously cooperated, especially the Shanghai-Ningbo and Shanghai-Hangzhou routes. 35,000 bags of Saigon rice were opened, and Siamese rice and small twisted rice were each opened for more than 5,000 bags. 500 bags of coarse, spicy rice and 3,500 bags of Saigon grains were also opened. The transaction was lively and was one of the most enthusiastic days this month. Because the transaction was lively, the price rose by 1 jiao half to 1 jiao. Customer Xian was also opened for 10,000 bags, except for over 100 bags of oil rice from this street, all were sold to inland areas, and the price also soared by 1 jiao.</p>
<p>River Rice</p>
<p>Yesterday, a total of more than 20 numbers (goods totaling nearly 5,000 stones) arrived from the South City, and the market color was beautiful. The selling market was refreshing, and Qingdao, Jinan, Yantai, Weihaiwei, and Huangdao and other groups also did 1,200 to 1,300 bags, so the situation was tight, and the market was shouting higher. As a result, the price of various thick japonica rice increased by about 1 jiao, and the late rice rose by a ruler or more. Furthermore, given the overall environment, the market participants were quite optimistic and hoped to see another beautiful market. The risk change was also continuously good. Twenty-one or two ships came from various routes in the Beishi River, and the sales of various types in the market, white stems, early thin rice, and activity were smooth. Yangshe Jian Baiyuan transactions were flat, the market price since the japonica rice price rose by 2 jiao, thin, the price added jiao, Xing rice followed and rose by 1 or 2 jiao, Yangjian and Dujian prices increased by 1 jiao, Baiyuan price remained flat.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Qimen Black Tea Will Be Released Soon</h3>
<p>Qimen black tea has suddenly become active since the China Farmers Bank invested in it. According to the news obtained from this question, there are as many as two hundred and ten tea producing factories in Qimen, Fuliang, and Zhizhi. In the future, the amount of production may be more than 50,000 boxes. Recently, the weather has been sunny and rainy, and tea farmers have seen that the companies are receiving green tea, and they have started picking on the 13th, and new tea will be released soon.</p>
<h3>Tea Factory in Tuzhuang is Preparing to Start Work</h3>
<p>There are more than thirty tea factories in Tuzhuang, this city. Recently, the factories have been preparing to start work since the new tea is coming to market. They are also in Suian and Zhuji, where tea is produced the earliest. Yesterday, many companies, such as Dachang Gong Sheng, sent personnel with money to the mountain to buy goods. It is expected that new tea will arrive in Shanghai around Guyu.</p>

<h3>Hardware: British Tinplate Prices Soar</h3>
<p>Hardware transactions were unusually deserted yesterday. The four-month term expired, and although the closing bank made special accommodation, many receivers still started, so the silver root in the market was still tight, and the actual trading relationship was greatly reduced. Therefore, except for a few items opened, there was no large-scale buying and selling. Only British tinplate was more smoothly because the fixed price soared (each box was 17 shillings and 6 pence, an increase of about 1 shilling compared to before), so the trading in this port was relatively smooth, and 400 to 500 boxes were opened. The market also brought about high two or three jiao, and each box was estimated to be 14 yuan two or three jiao, and the current transaction also needed 14 yuan.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Hui Xian)</p>
<p>Obstacles are not our enemies, but truly benefactors. The arrival of obstacles can temper within us all kinds of forces to "overcome obstacles." A tree in the forest, if it has not battled against storms and heavy rains hundreds of times, cannot have a trunk that grows very sturdy. Similarly, if a person does not encounter various obstacles, their personality and abilities will not grow sturdy either. Therefore, all trials, sorrows, and grief are sufficient to assist and temper us.</p>
<p>Ability is the result of resisting difficulties. Great individuals are all produced in the struggle with difficulties. It is impossible to cultivate abilities without struggling against difficulties and obstacles. "Without tempering in life, you can only be considered half a person at death!"</p>
<h3>Historical Research on Mahjong</h3>
<p>— Xi Dan</p>
<p>A few years ago, mahjong tiles suddenly became popular overseas and became a type of export commodity. In European and American societies, many people learned to play mahjong. Later, Japan was also infected. For a period of time, mahjong even became the most fashionable game in Western society. Clubs were almost all mahjong tables. Bookstores published many pamphlets studying mahjong. Chinese students without money could earn a living by teaching mahjong. However, their enthusiasm soon cooled down. They would never become mahjong believers, never be conquered by mahjong. Mahjong is only a patent of our nation, which loves leisure and wastes time.</p>
<p>Regarding its historical process, there is also a long period. During the late Ming Dynasty, playing cards called "Ma Diao" were popular among the people. Ma Diao only had forty cards, with values from one to nine wen, one thousand to nine thousand, and ten thousand to ninety thousand, equivalent to the "tubes," "bamboos," and "characters" suits of mahjong. There was also a "zero" card, which is the ancestor of the "white board." Each Ma Diao card was painted with characters from the Water Margin. "Wang Ying" on the Huizhou playing cards is the remnant of the dwarfish tiger Wang Ying. The complete works of Wang Shi-han, who lived during the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods, contain several types of Ma Diao cards from the Ming Dynasty.</p>
<p>Ma Diao was very popular at that time. Scholar-officials played Ma Diao all day and all night, neglecting their proper business. Therefore, Wu Meicun said in "A Brief Account of Suppressing the Bandits" that the Ming Dynasty was destroyed by Ma Diao.</p>
<p>Over three hundred years, the forty cards of Ma Diao gradually transformed into mahjong tiles with four of each type (Ma Diao was played by three players against one, hence the name "Ma Diao Jiao," abbreviated as "Ma Diao." Mahjong is a phonetic change of "Ma Jiao.") The clever transformation made it even easier to bewitch the Chinese people with 136 tiles.</p>
<h3>Old Hu</h3>
<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>Old Hu is truly a wonderful person; he can adapt to his environment.</p>
<p>The year before last, he was a low-level clerk in a certain agency, with a not-so-generous income. Therefore, he was very frugal in his self-care. His clothes were not very fancy, always wearing the same long, free-style呢 gown. He himself was so frugal, and whenever he saw friends, he always advised them to be frugal as well, while at the same time warning them against someone's arbitrary extravagance, saying that such waste of money was not to be followed.</p>
<p>Last year, he was suddenly promoted from a low-level clerk to a section chief. As a result, his life underwent a major transformation. He lived in a large house, wore very fancy clothes, and commanded servants, living very extravagantly. During that period, old friends like us found it difficult to meet him. Even if we did meet, he would always say, "How long do people live? If you have the opportunity to enjoy life and don't, wouldn't you be a fool?"</p>
<p>This year, he was frustrated. The director changed, and he left with him, losing his original position as a low-level clerk. So he immediately scaled back his lifestyle, scaling it back to an even more frugal existence than in the days of the low-level clerk. At the same time, he suddenly became very affectionate when he saw friends. He was so affectionate when he saw successful friends, and so affectionate when he saw frustrated friends—no matter who it was, he was so affectionate that he would talk about everything.</p>
<p>Therefore, among his friends, no one didn't say, "Old Hu is truly a wonderful person; he can adapt to his environment."</p>
<h3>The Last Road</h3>
<h3>Selling News and Selling Court Gazettes</h3>
<p>— Song Zhe Wang</p>
<p>"Oh my! How strange, how strange, how truly strange! Pudong has a local drama! There's an eighty-year-old man marrying a seven-year-old girl! There's even a little brother being raised in the wedding sedan! Truly a fresh drama! Buy it for a copper coin and see how truly interesting it is!"</p>
<p>In the past, in the alleyways of Shanghai, you could often hear people like this "selling news" holding a few poorly printed lithographs. The content wasn't worth a knowledgeable person's smile. They relied entirely on their flowery language to lure the ignorant into being fooled.</p>
<p>In our childhood, we saw hawkers "selling court gazettes." Behind them, like a raised awning, they carried a square book stand, with pictures drawn on one side and words written on the other. They held a small gong that sounded like the spring festival, and in the blue cloth bag on their shoulder were a few small booklets with yellow covers. These were the "court gazettes" being sold.</p>
<p>The court gazette sellers gathered an audience by beating the small gong, verbally announcing the general outline of a case. Most of them were also fabricating rumors. For example, the "Tongzhou Child Murder Report" was a type of court gazette back then.</p>
<p>Selling court gazettes was also a type of traveling trade. They could print a small booklet and travel through three passes and six docks, relying on it. In the past, people cherished their reputation. If their own affairs were made into a court gazette and sold, they considered it a great shame. So, the court gazette sellers took advantage of this weakness, often engaging in extortion.</p>
<p>In the past, selling court gazettes was a lifelong profession. Now, selling news is a fly-by-night business. Selling court gazettes can be said to be China's earliest invention of newspapers. Since newspapers became popular throughout the country, the profession of selling court gazettes gradually declined and eventually disappeared. Since newspapers began publishing strange and bizarre social news, the business of "selling news" has also been snatched away by newspaper reporters.</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Eleven: Ashamed of Having No Clothes, She Avoids Guests Behind Curtains; Diligently Saving Lamp Oil, She Copies Books at Dawn</p>
<p>Yueying was also embarrassed by what he said and, lifting a piece of her soaked skirt, rubbed her eyes. Zhiqian said, "This isn't something to just cry about. If you really have no clothes, you could borrow two ill-fitting pieces. Even if you can't find women's clothes, wearing men's clothes temporarily wouldn't be a problem, it's much better than being soaked through." As he spoke, the area where Yueying was standing was wet by the water dripping from him, leaving a wet circle on the ground. Zhiqian looked down at the water circle at his feet. Aunt Hu, after all, was Yueying's aunt, and seeing this scene, she felt a bit sorry for her, so she said, "Just listen to Master Cheng and go to his room to hide for a while. I'll go to the front and tell them you can't come. I think you're really soaked through. If you don't go, Master Jia won't blame you. I'll give you an idea, ask the tea boy for a quilt, take off your wet clothes, wrap yourself in the quilt, and I'll help you dry your clothes and then come back to pick you up." Zhiqian said, "Why borrow a quilt from the tea boy? Just go to my room, close the door, draw the curtains, and get into my quilt to sleep, and I won't enter the room." Aunt Hu said, "If he closes the door, how will her clothes get out to be dried?" Zhiqian said, "I'm just saying that, I don't necessarily want you to do that. I'll go sit in a friend's room for a while, you just go to my room." As he said this, he called the tea boy, told him, and then went out into the rain towards the front yard. Huanhua, listening, couldn't help but be moved. She never expected that there would be such a good person in the Little Western Paradise Hotel. (183)</p>
<h3>The Floating Fragrance of the Imperial Incense</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>When a pair of new shoes was completely made, it had to be immediately sent to the Empress Dowager for her to inspect. If she happened to be free, she would examine them carefully, so there was absolutely no possibility of shoddy workmanship. However, not every pair could fully satisfy the Empress Dowager's wishes. She would often take one look and send them to that "shoe storehouse," where the two eunuchs would store them, and perhaps they would never be taken out again. Rarely, if a pair of shoes was made particularly to her liking, she would not let it go lightly. Her memory was excellent, and she would not forget what she had seen. She would also secretly make a decision to wear these new shoes on a particular festival. When that day arrived, she would never forget and would have someone fetch them the night before.</p>
<p>Among the tools used for making shoes that I mentioned above, some were small embroidery frames. The style of the embroidery frame was roughly similar to a loom. The embroidery girls would sit upright inside it. The main point of the embroidery frame was a stretcher frame, on which a square of tribute satin was tightly stretched. The size of this square of tribute satin was about two feet high and five feet wide, and it had to be stretched very tightly, as tight and flat as a piece of leather nailed to the surface of a large drum, because it could not be embroidered otherwise. If we stood next to the embroidery frame, we could see pairs of shoe uppers gradually taking shape under the nimble and skilled fingers of these female workers. In this main hall, there were about ten embroidery frames, each with a square of tribute satin stretched on it, and each was assigned to a female worker, responsible for embroidery. (293)</p>

<h3>Pilgrimage to the City Center</h3>
<p>— Sun Yucai</p>
<p>Those who have been to the city center, I think, must have a common feeling about the city center, that is, solemn, great, clean, neat, immersed in the gentle embrace of nature.</p>
<p>The city center is the location of the highest administrative organ in Shanghai, China. It should be solemn, great, clean, and neat. When every foreigner comes to Shanghai, this is the first impression given to them, especially diplomats. From here, they learn more about the beauty of Chinese architecture.</p>
<p>Take the municipal government bus from the Baoshan Road intersection. From the green gauze window, you can see a lot of green seedlings in the fields on both sides. After passing Fudan University, before long, in the vast blue sky, you can see a palace-style building, standing tall, that is the municipal government. On both sides of it, there are two rectangular buildings, that is, the various bureaus under the municipal government, the Education Bureau, the Health Bureau, the Social Bureau, the Public Works Bureau, and the Land Bureau. In front of the official land, there are five staff dormitories, arranged in a simple and elegant manner. In the first two buildings, we can hear the voices of women and children, that is, where family members can live. In front of the municipal government is the library and museum, which are two of the more complete cultural institutions in China, and the future books and specimens must be extremely rich. Next to the library, there is a Roman-style building, standing there with a unique posture, which is a newly established political elementary school, coupled with complete equipment, which is not often found in China. Running horizontally from Zhengzhong Elementary School, you will arrive at the gymnasium and swimming pool, the first sports field in East Asia under construction, the scale of which is unprecedented in East Asia. The next National Games have been decided to be held here. People who are tired from sports can immediately get a place to rest, wandering among the red pavilions and green trees, because next to the sports injuries is a large municipal park. There are also municipal hospitals and health test stations, etc., which are also under construction. As for the inside of the municipal government, a large auditorium and a municipal conference room, its greatness and magnificence, are truly unprecedented. Although I have been to Nanjing, I have not admired the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Communications, I don't know how they compare.</p>
<p>We know that the opening of the city center is only two or three years old, and there are still many unfinished places. When it is complete, I think there will definitely be a city center tour guide.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Not "Scholars Despising Each Other"</h3>
<p>— Another Realm</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. Cao Juren discussed "scholars despising each other" in Free Talk, citing many anecdotes from literary history, as if "scholars despising each other" was indeed "inherent since ancient times." Therefore, it seems not surprising that present-day scholars also "despise each other." Mr. Cao's conclusion is that "despising each other" is not a bad phenomenon in the literary world. Literature, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, has progressed in this way, as long as it is not a "personal attack," it should exist and will inevitably exist. I think this conclusion cannot be considered very appropriate.</p>
<p>Because "scholars despising each other," even if it is not a "personal attack," still cannot be said to be a good phenomenon in the literary world. Even according to Cao Zhi's statement that the reason for "scholars despising each other" lies in "each taking what they are good at, despising what they are short of," Mr. Cao Juren believes that this phenomenon can be considered a kind of "criticism," but this method of criticism cannot be used as our norm. Why? Because this way of criticizing is called intuitive criticism in criticism theory. The starting point of intuitive criticism is a subjective emotional impulse. The components of this emotional impulse are prejudice, emotionalism, and jealousy. The components of academic theory are often very few. Even from the many anecdotes listed by Mr. Cao, there is almost not one that is not the best example of intuitive criticism (if it can indeed be called "criticism"). Combat is a driving force for progress, and criticism is a part of combat, so all social ideologies need to be criticized, but the critic must stand on a social position. It is not enough to simply "despise" each other personally. Even if what is "despised" is indeed real, it will only show narrow-mindedness and will not be of much help to the overall situation of the literary world. Don't we often hear people say that there are still no critics in the Chinese new literary world? However, the fact of "scholars despising each other" is something that our countrymen can pick up a dozen or two of. If we are not "deliberately belittling ourselves," then those who are shouting will all be making trouble unreasonably!</p>
<p>Even if we take a step back and say that "scholars despising each other" is indeed "inherent since ancient times," it is still not enough for us to follow now. Inherent in human nature is a kind of jealousy. This jealousy originates from self-survival. In primitive society, it was the survival of the fittest. In advanced society, there is group competition, where the victor exists and the loser perishes. However, what we should pay attention to is that this competition is the result of human civilization. Originally, the outcome was determined by individual physical strength, but by this time, it has been determined by the social foundation and historical mission of the group. Therefore, even if individual physical strength is strong, if the social foundation to which he belongs collapses, then this person will still fail. For example, Zhang Taiyan's "despising" Liang Qichao, one represents the feudal class that is about to collapse, and the other represents the emerging bourgeois class. By now, the outcome has been determined. Apart from scolding Zhang Taiyan for "driving backwards," we really cannot make the kind of judgment that Mr. Cao said, "On the one hand, it must meet the needs of the times, and on the other hand, it must have solid scholarship." Doesn't solid scholarship need to meet the needs of the times? I think Mr. Cao will also laugh at this. This kind of "despising" is actually "competing," how can it be simply classified as "scholars despising each other" that is "inherent since ancient times"? In the "scholars despising each other" of ancient times, you cannot find such an example.</p>
<p>From this, my conclusion comes: although "scholars despising each other" is "inherent since ancient times," it is not a model for the modern literary world because its starting point is limited to the jealousy of self-survival. What we want is "scholars despising each other" that contains social value!</p>
<h3>Two Ladies</h3>
<p>— Qin Wen</p>
<p>If there is a domestic ship to take, you must take a domestic ship: besides, I am in a hurry to get to school, and the most recent sailing is a domestic ship. However,</p>
<p>"I'm afraid there are no more berths;"</p>
<p>The clerk in the ticket office said to me. Following that with "let's go ask," he escorted me to the pier, to the door of the ship's purser's office. The clerk spoke loudly, "I need a berth, a full fare ticket!"</p>
<p>"Ah yo! Berths!" The voice came from the purser's office.</p>
<p>"It's a full fare ticket! Please find a way to arrange it!" The clerk said again. He drew out the sound of the words "full fare" very long and said them very loudly. At first, I didn't understand what was going on, but after a while, I remembered clearly that it was possible to buy half-fare tickets on domestic ships, and there were many who bought half-fare tickets. Lately, I have been taking foreign ships all the time, and I have become unfamiliar with this situation, which is really something to be ashamed of.</p>
<p>As a result of the clerk's negotiation with the purser, I was led to the back of the ship, in the center of two small rooms.</p>
<p>"Now there is a male guest coming, and there are no empty berths elsewhere, please two female guests share a room!" The purser said this to the room on the left first.</p>
<p>"Alright!" The answer came from a woman of twenty-five or twenty-six, her shoulders covered with hair, looking like she was regrowing the hair she had cut short.</p>
<p>The purser turned to the room on the right and said the same thing as before. The answer was also "alright," but it was relayed by a orderly, and I couldn't see the situation inside clearly.</p>
<p>"Then, please move over!" The purser said again.</p>
<p>The orderly turned around and went away, mumbled a bit, and then turned back to answer, "Their lady said, it's better for the lady over there to move over!"</p>
<p>So the purser went to ask the female guest in the room on the left to move, but she also refused, saying that sharing a room was fine, but she would not move into another woman's room.</p>
<p>The purser went to talk to the person in the room on the right again. They mumbled again;</p>
<p>"Their lady doesn't want to move over, does our lady want to move over?" The orderly said loudly, very confidently.</p>
<p>"The two ladies are the same," the purser frowned and muttered to himself, "the lady over here doesn't want to move over, and the lady over there doesn't want to move over!"</p>
<p>The clerk said kindly to the orderly from the side, "Fellow countryman! You don't have much luggage, please take a little effort, move over, I'll help you carry things!"</p>
<p>"It's not that I'm afraid of the effort of moving things! The lady doesn't want to! Our lady is usually very easy to talk to, but she doesn't want to move into another woman's room!"</p>
<p>He said these words very sincerely, very movingly. I would rather withdraw and take another ship, but the surroundings were already full of spectators; probably for the sake of business, the purser's face turned red, and he vigorously said "lady" here and "lady" there, as if he had to settle it, it was like riding a tiger.</p>
<p>Surrounded by the crowd, in the tense situation, from these two ladies, I was reminded of the women in my hometown neighborhood, who would accommodate anything, but would not move into a house that already housed a woman with whom there was a relationship; not only would the first wife not move into the house where the concubine was, but the concubine would also not want to live in the first wife's house; thinking that this was the greatest shame, something to rather die than compromise.</p>
<p>I was also reminded of the saying "if you have money, don't live in the east or west room." In the past, there were two friends, very close; they got married at the same time and planned to live together, which they had agreed on long ago. But in the same house, the rooms always had east, west, south, and north distinctions; both brides were unwilling to live in the east or west room, which caused disagreements, and they finally lived separately. Renting alone still only had the east and west rooms; it's just that they had no relationship with the landlord, so there was no so-called comparison, so they no longer cared.</p>
<p>Not casually moving into another woman's house was originally a belief that most women held tightly to: it was still like this on the ship, it was a characteristic of domestic women, which you could see on domestic ships. So, taking a domestic ship, you could see this situation.</p>
<h3>Mother and Son</h3>
<h3>Age Fourteen</h3>
<p>— Zegang</p>
<p>"Uncle, does my dad want me to go back?"</p>
<p>Xiao Lan, with a face flushed red like the setting sun on the horizon, looked up and asked the uncle with eyes full of doubt. The uncle was a neighbor from home. Last year, Xiao Lan's father entrusted him to send his son to the city to find work, but now he asked him to send a letter, calling his son back.</p>
<p>"The labor cost in the countryside is expensive this year. Your dad wants to save the wages of a long-term worker and let you help. Staying in the city is just suffering."</p>
<p>"Three years, the boss said that after three full years, I can get four or five yuan a month. And in this small restaurant, I can always get some oily food..." The child was reluctant to leave the small shop where he had stayed for a year. He remembered the days when he couldn't even gnaw on vegetable leaves at home. Touching the flesh on his face, it seemed that he had never had it before.</p>
<p>The middle-aged "uncle" seemed impatient with the child's questioning:</p>
<p>"Your dad can't wait. At first, he wanted to endure it and get you out to gain a foothold, but now he can't bear it anymore. This year, most of the strong young men in the countryside have come to the city, and the labor cost is getting more and more expensive... You, aren't you growing very strong? You can抵得上most of the work, at least."</p>
<p>The child stretched out his arms, which were indeed not thin. Maybe he resembled his father and would never grow tall. He had a thick waist, thick arms and legs. Looking at these arms and legs, they would probably become thin again soon. He felt a little sad:</p>
<p>"Only a full year left, can't Dad endure it?...”</p>
<p>"Here, not only can you not get money, but you also have to ask for new clothes and shoes from home. Your mother even altered her own new shirt to make a big coat for you."</p>
<p>Only then did Xiao Lan suddenly remember his mother. She was even more eager than his father for him to succeed. Two days before her son decided to leave home, she rushed to make two sets of trousers and two pairs of new shoes overnight. When she personally tried a new apron on Xiao Lan, her eyes filled with tears:</p>
<p>"Work hard as an apprentice. Be careful when carrying bowls and plates. You are short, so it is really a bit difficult. It will be fine in two years."</p>
<p>These words were still ringing in Xiao Lan's ears. He knew how heartbroken his mother would be when she saw him wearing a blue apron, looking like a little apprentice being bossed around in a restaurant, but luckily she had not yet come to the city to see him. He couldn't tell her—the person who loved him most in this world—that he braved the cold in the winter wind and snow, carrying a lunch basket and delivering food from street to street, his red and purple hands covered with blood clots, and he was still scolded by others when he delivered the food, for spilling the dishes, for the food being cold... In addition, the shopkeeper reprimanded him for being lazy or a glutton. Xiao Lan swallowed all these grievances, only remembering "three years". He remembered his parents' instructions. His father often stroked his head:</p>
<p>"It is certain that the son is stronger than the father..."</p>
<p>Over the past year, the apron for which his mother shed tears had also become thin. Every time he washed it himself, he always thought:</p>
<p>"It's about to tear. I should ask Mom to make a new one. After three torn ones, I will be able to make a name for myself."</p>
<p>Thinking of these things, Xiao Lan's face always had a smile.</p>
<p>But now it was clear that the uncle was going to take him back.</p>
<p>While waiting to buy a ticket in front of the long-distance bus company, a large bus was filled with a group of excited children in yellow clothes and yellow hats, singing songs. Xiao Lan asked blankly:</p>
<p>"Uncle, are those children students?"</p>
<p>"Students. It's spring, probably going to the mountains to play."</p>
<p>Xiao Lan was not surprised that the uncle could answer so casually, but only felt that this group of children should be about the same age as him, and thought:</p>
<p>"Don't their parents worry about them, like Xiao Lan's parents, pushing their son to the city one moment and pulling him back from the city the next?"</p>
<p>A question like a broken thread occupied the child's mind. After seeing the children's bus drive away, Xiao Lan finally asked:</p>
<p>"Uncle, how old are those children?"</p>
<p>"Fourteen or fifteen, a good age!"</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm fourteen, about the same as them——"</p>
<p>Fluttering his eyelashes, Xiao Lan said softly, absentmindedly.</p>
<h3>First Impression</h3>
<p>— Lu Fen</p>
<p>—A Reminiscence—</p>
<p>(First impressions are often wrong, because humans are clever, and we are too confident in this cleverness.)</p>
<p>The night was already deep. The air was cold and damp, filled with clinging dew. I was ushered into a small room. The room was narrow and damp, with old tables, stools, and a bed. The white plaster on the walls was falling off. The dirt floor was wet and seemed to be black. In short, although it did not have the majestic luxuriance of a forest, it was as melancholy as a forest. There was a strong musty smell, coming from the peeling walls and the shady corners.</p>
<p>'Where am I?'</p>
<p>Thinking this, I felt as melancholy as the small room.</p>
<p>But I couldn't figure out where I was.</p>
<p>I only knew that the small room had two window holes, which did not allow air to pass through because they were covered with paper. Finding a cigarette, I smoked it and took another look at the small room, feeling both familiar and strange. It turned out that I had come in through the door. The two doors, made of one-inch thick wooden planks, were thickly painted and emitted an unpleasant light, an ancient and gloomy light. The door opened at one end of the room, leading to another room. At first, I thought I was staying in an inn, but there was no sound of mules and horses in the courtyard, nor could I hear any hoofbeats.</p>
<p>A kerosene lamp was placed on the table, constantly emitting smoke, and the light was very dim. I sat with my back to the lamp, watching the shadow on the ground. The shadow flickered, luring me. I didn't know what was strange, but while tiptoeing, I imagined that people and horses suddenly rushed out of the ravine, holding torches and shouting loudly... I thought very far and a lot.</p>
<p>The night shrouded the basin in a secretive way, so deep. The sound of the bell in the temple rang, peaceful and ancient, shouting for what, the loud and magnificent sound crossed the mountains and sent into the desolate valley. The dog barked timidly, appearing very sluggish because the air was humid. In such a place, dogs are often disturbed. From I don't know when, a voice shouted in the wilderness, an unchanging cry, perhaps to attract his lost sheep and children. The call was very lonely, like the shadow of a single goose, falling into an unknown place. Because it was constantly shouting, it was more like a shout from centuries ago, now accidentally excavated like an antique.</p>
<p>I took out another cigarette and lit it, still sitting motionless, as if expecting something.</p>
<p>Although I had never been to Spain, I had already thought of Spain.</p>
<p>Was this first impression reliable? I walked into the moonless night to listen to the call in the wilderness...</p>
<h3>Mr. Ju Qing (15)</h3>
<p>— Ke Ling</p>
<p>"Hey, what is that old man doing, acting sneaky!"</p>
<p>Ignoring the drumbeat-like palpitations of the play, he walked on as if nothing had happened. Before he had taken two or three steps, he heard a child suddenly shout from the crowd:</p>
<p>"Ah, he is the private school teacher from Goose Market Alley, catch him!"</p>
<p>Then, everyone immediately started shouting in a chaotic manner, rolling up their sleeves and waving their small arms in a mock manner.</p>
<p>"He's here to peek at the school, catch him! Catch him!"</p>
<p>Mr. Ju Qing's heart beat so fast that his breathing became very rapid. A fire of anger rushed up, and his face turned ashen. He turned around abruptly, stopped, clenched his teeth, and said:</p>
<p>"You little devils, you, you!"</p>
<p>The children stood still, not daring to step forward. They looked at each other.</p>
<p>"You little devils, with no parents to teach you!"</p>
<p>Afraid that there were still teachers inside, Mr. Ju Qing cursed hatefully and walked away. As soon as he left, seven or eight students followed him like bees out of a hive, shouting chaotically.</p>
<p>"Don't run away, you rotten bug!"</p>
<p>"You old undead, underworld scholar!"</p>
<p>"Hahaha, rotten bug, underworld scholar!"</p>
<p>A mixture of chaotic laughter, shouting, and clapping echoed all the way outside the school gate. Seeing that Mr. Ju Qing had no intention of counterattacking, they chased him for a while before returning in a victorious manner, shouting.</p>
<p>Suffering such insults was a first for Mr. Ju Qing in his life. In front of him, even the most tyrannical children would become like lambs under the butcher's knife. He never expected that today he would be ridiculed and made fun of by a group of children. His whole body was ice-cold, and his head was dizzy. He ran down the street, his steps faltering. He never expected to suffer such an unexpected grievance today.</p>

<h3>Easter Greeting Telegram</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>——Attention to Those Pursuing International Social Etiquette——</p>
<p>According to Western customs, telegrams are commonly exchanged during Easter and Christmas to greet relatives and friends. During these periods, telecommunications bureaus in various countries receive thousands of such telegrams daily, making their work exceptionally busy. As Western influence spreads eastward, the number of Westerners residing in China increases daily, and the number of telegrams sent during the holidays is also increasing daily. The Ministry of Communications promulgated international New Year's greeting telegram regulations on October 24, 1932, allowing international holiday greetings to be sent around Christmas, with fees only one-third of the total price, as a type of national diplomatic telegram.</p>
<p>Christmas has already been opened for greeting telegrams, but there is no reduced fee provision around Easter, which is somewhat lacking. In order to develop international telegraphy, the Ministry of Communications has specially stipulated that international Easter Greeting Telegrams will be available from April 15th to April 22nd. The available destinations and fee methods are as follows: (1) Destinations are limited to those sent via wireless or submarine cable to England, Germany, the United States, Canada, Newfoundland, Hawaii, the Philippines, and via wireless to Japan. (2) Each telegram should have a minimum of ten characters, and the fee is one-third of the total price of an ordinary telegram in silver dollars. (3) The payment identifier (Xet) is charged as one character. It is said that the remaining methods are the same as New Year's greeting telegrams.</p>
<p>Chinese people who pursue international social etiquette should send these telegrams. In particular, they should introduce them to Western friends in China and have them send these telegrams.</p>
<h3>Talking About Telephone Information Desks</h3>
<p>— Qinghua</p>
<p>…Purely for the purpose of serving the public…</p>
<p>…Telephone users should make full use of it…</p>
<p>In the past two years, the Ministry of Communications has been striving to improve the telegraph and telephone business, and its policy is based entirely on facilitating the public. Since telegraphs and telephones are state-owned transportation undertakings, they are not purely for commercial profit. The convenience of public communication should be provided as much as possible so that the public feels well-served and enjoys the benefits of state-owned enterprises. Recently, the Ministry of Communications also ordered nine telephone bureaus in Shanghai, Tianjin, Beiping, Wuhan, the capital, Qingdao, Yantai, Zhenjiang, Wuxian, etc., to add information desks from April 1st. In addition to answering users' inquiries about telephone numbers, they also answer users' inquiries about various local affairs. Except for those who use long-distance telephones or public telephones to inquire, who should be charged long-distance or additional call fees according to regulations, ordinary city users can inquire to the information desk at any time without charge. However, the scope of inquiries is temporarily limited to the following items:</p>
<p>(1) City telephone rental fees and long-distance telephone communication locations and prices</p>
<p>(2) Domestic and international telegram reporting locations and prices</p>
<p>(3) Domestic and international mail delivery locations and postage</p>
<p>(4) Daily business hours of post and telecommunications bureaus</p>
<p>(5) Standard time</p>
<p>(6) Location of fire alarms on the day</p>
<p>(7) Train, ship, and long-distance bus departure times and prices</p>
<p>(8) Daily programs and times of various entertainment venues</p>
<p>The scope of inquiry matters is limited to the above eight types because it is the first time to set up and the preparation is extremely troublesome. In the future, it will gradually expand, so that the public's ordinary questions can be resolved through the telephone information desk, and the public's habit of using the telephone can be cultivated invisibly, indirectly making the telephone business more developed. Therefore, the establishment of this information desk is really a win-win situation!</p>
<p>However, the reporter cannot help but say that the purpose of the Ministry of Communications' establishment of the telephone information desk is purely to serve the public. At the beginning of the establishment, the answers to users' inquiries may not be complete. It is hoped that users will cooperate with the spirit and notify the telephone bureau in writing to improve it, and do not overly criticize it. At the same time, it is hoped that the telephone bureau's主管人員will seek to collect the necessary reference documents within the scope of inquiry, and pay attention to changes at any time (it is best to negotiate with the relevant agencies in advance, and immediately send the price list or timetable to the bureau when there are changes in prices or times) in order to avoid answering incorrectly and causing misunderstandings. If there are matters that the inquiry desk cannot answer in detail, the telephone number of the agency, company, or shop that handles the matter should be told to the user, so that the user can directly inquire. As for the staff of the inquiry desk, it is especially hoped that they will be humble in attitude and thorough in answering, so that users feel satisfied, and can increase the reputation of the telephone bureau.</p>
<h3>Revised Method of Charging for Newspaper Telegrams</h3>
<p>— Song</p>
<p>The news media and the telecommunications industry in our country share the mission of building Chinese culture and serving the public and society. There is no doubt that they should cooperate closely with each other. However, recently, some newspaper publishers have accumulated a lot of arrears of telegram fees. After the telecommunications bureau urged them to pay back, some have not yet implemented it. Or it is said that some of these newspaper publishers use the "news policy" and the psychology that state-owned enterprises can keep accounts because of insufficient economic resources, and often delay paying news telegram fees, etc. The author believes that the above statement not only slanders the personality of the news media, but also is enough to block the source of news for the cooperation between the news media and the telecommunications industry. The author has already clarified this meaning in the article "The News Media and the Arrears of Telephone and Telegraph Fees" in the 33rd issue of this publication.</p>
<p>Then, why are newspaper telegram fees accumulated so much? Considering the reason, isn't it also the fault of the telecommunications bureau's poor fee collection methods, which led to more and more accumulation and difficulty in paying off? Let's talk about the reason:</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the new world, the Ministry of Communications has a method for news telegrams to be paid by the recipient. This method is that when a news reporter applies for a license, the words "reporting fee is paid by the recipient" are noted in the license. After being approved by the Ministry of Communications, they can hold the license to send telegrams to designated telecommunications bureaus, and add the RTP identification to the bottom of the telegram. The receiving bureau will then charge the sender or receiver based on this. The news reporter holding this license does not need to carry heavy assets, but enjoys the right to send telegrams everywhere, which is very convenient. However, in this method, the sending bureau fills out a fee list at the end of the month and sends it to the receiving bureau to collect the fee from the receiver. The sending bureaus mostly delay making and sending the above list, so that the receiving bureau cannot collect the fee from the receiver on a monthly basis. Over time, a lot of arrears accumulate, and the receiver often uses the delayed sending of the list as an excuse to delay paying the fee. This is the origin of the arrears of news telegram fees.</p>
<p>In view of this, the Ministry of Communications stipulates that from April 1st of this year, all news telegram fees paid by the receiver will be filled in by the receiving bureau on a daily basis based on the telegram receipts, and after the end of the month, they will be sent to the news agency that receives the telegram no later than the 5th of the following month to collect the fee. If the fee is not paid within five days after the list is sent, the delivery of news telegrams should be stopped immediately, and it should be reported to the Telecommunications Administration to order the sending bureau to stop receiving the news telegrams of that family, so as to prevent the fee from being unpaid. After this method is implemented, the receiving bureau does not need to rely on the list of the sending bureau, resulting in a delay in sending the telegrams for months. The receiver cannot use the delay in sending the list as an excuse for not paying the fee. This is truly a good way to organize news telegram fees. The spirit of cooperation between the news media and the telecommunications industry will become closer.</p>
<h3>Advantages of Postal Telegraphic Transfer</h3>
<p>— Zhong Ming</p>
<p>Usually, if people remit urgent funds, they entrust banks to handle it, and very few people entrust it to the postal savings and remittance bureau or the post office that also handles savings and remittance business. The reason for this is that, first, the postal savings and remittance bureau or the post office has not been handling telegraphic transfer business for a long time, and it is not well known to the public; second, although the public knows that the post office handles telegraphic transfer, they do not know its advantages, so the business is not developed. How to publicize and promote the postal telegraphic transfer business is irrelevant to this article and need not be described in detail. What I want to talk about are the several advantages of postal telegraphic transfer.</p>
<p>Speaking of the advantages of postal telegraphic transfer, it is nothing more than "economy" and "convenience." How can entrusting the post office to telegraphic transfer doubtful items be economical? Originally, in order to facilitate the public and serve the society, the Ministry of Communications specifically stipulates that telegraphic transfer telegrams sent by the savings and remittance bureau or the post office, each within 20 characters, only charge a telegram fee of six dimes of silver, and five cents of silver yuan are added for each character exceeding the limit. Everyone, think about how much cheaper this telegraphic transfer telegram fee is than what the bank charges. A friend of the reporter once entrusted a certain bank in Beijing to telegraphic transfer 200 yuan to Hankou due to an urgent need at home, and had to pay a telegraphic transfer telegram fee of 2.6 yuan. Later, when the reporter met him and talked about this matter, he thought that the cost of telegraphic transfer was too expensive. The reporter then introduced the method of postal telegraphic transfer, and the man suddenly realized, and seemed to have a feeling of "regret for not knowing each other sooner." After checking, the man lived on Huili Road in Hankou. I secretly estimated for him that if this doubtful item was entrusted to the local postal savings and remittance bureau to remit it, the telegram would definitely not exceed 20 characters, then it would be enough to pay a remittance telegram fee of six dimes. This story is the best example to prove that postal telegraphic transfer reduces the burden on remitters. Secondly, for example, sometimes you want to remit an urgent doubtful item, the amount is not large, and the recipient is very eager, of course you can send it by telegraphic transfer. However, in view of the high remittance fee of the bank, it does not seem to be an economical way, which often makes people hesitate and miss the opportunity. Now, the Ministry of Communications Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau's telegraphic transfer, the reporting fee is very cheap, and it is fast and reliable, which truly conforms to the principle of economy.</p>
<p>Another advantage of postal telegraphic transfer is "convenience." Everyone should understand that banks in our country have not been established everywhere, and there are no bank fronts in remote areas, so the bank's handling of telegraphic transfer business is only limited to a few large cities where branches have been established, and the convenience given to the public is only limited to one corner. As for post offices, they are set up all over the country, so people in the interior who want to remit urgent doubtful items can make full use of the postal telegraphic transfer method and entrust the local post office to handle it. This is another advantage of postal telegraphic transfer. Again, since the establishment of the post and telecommunications bureau, all places where post offices are established also collect telegrams, or the post and telecommunications bureaus are established together. Therefore, there is a close and perfect connection between the post and telecommunications, and the postal remittance telegrams sent by the post office can be immediately handed over to the telegraph bureau nearby for sending, which is much faster in terms of time and continuity. This is another small advantage of postal telegraphic transfer. Readers may wish to try it, and you will know that what I said is not wrong.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications' Policy on Broadcast Radio</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>According to the telecommunications regulations promulgated by the National Government, the establishment of private broadcast radio stations must be approved by the Ministry of Communications or its entrusted agency, and people who install wireless radios must register with the Ministry of Communications or its entrusted agency and obtain a license. Regarding the above matters, the Ministry of Communications has the right to collect license fees and formulate banning rules. All the "Provisional Measures for Registration of Wireless Radio Sets for Broadcasting" promulgated by the Ministry of Communications on April 10, 1931, and the "Provisional Rules for Banning Private Broadcast Radio Stations" promulgated on November 24, 1932, are based on the special powers granted to the Ministry of Communications by the above-mentioned telecommunications regulations.</p>
<p>If we study the above-mentioned provisional measures for the registration of radio receivers, we can see that the Ministry of Communications intends to promote the installation of radio receivers by the people, because it stipulates that the procedures for registering all radio receivers are very simple. You only need to obtain a registration application form from the Ministry of Communications or the telegraph bureaus in various places, fill it out according to the format, and you can obtain a registration certificate. The above registration and license issuing procedures are free of charge. However, on the one hand, in order to prevent fraud, the management of broadcasting stations and radio receivers is strictly required. For example, the establishment of broadcasting stations is only allowed to citizens of the Republic of China, companies that are wholly owned by Chinese merchants, schools, groups, or other legal organizations registered by the National Government. Companies that are not wholly owned by Chinese merchants and groups that are not wholly of Chinese nationality must obtain a registration certificate issued by the National Government before they can establish a broadcasting station. In addition, if people who install radio receivers fail to apply for registration and obtain a registration certificate in accordance with the measures stipulated by the Ministry, once discovered, in addition to confiscating all the machines in accordance with the provisions of the telecommunications regulations, they will also be fined up to 2,000 yuan depending on the circumstances.</p>
<p>Observing from the facts, the Ministry of Communications seemed to have been neglecting broadcasting affairs because of other postal, telecommunications, and aviation affairs waiting to be dealt with, so it was somewhat laissez-faire in some places. Taking the number of private broadcasting stations in Shanghai as an example, there are more than 50. The maximum power is only 500 watts, and the minimum is only 15 watts (the power of the Nanjing Central Broadcasting Station is 75,000 watts), which leads to chaotic frequencies and mixed sound waves, not only making listeners feel uncomfortable, but also sometimes affecting the important communication of state-owned radio stations. Although this is partly due to the special relationship of the concession, if the Ministry of Communications can do its best to ban it, there is of course still room for improvement. In the past one or two years, the Ministry of Communications has been working hard to rectify various undertakings and has already achieved results, so it gradually has the remaining power to pay attention to the issue of broadcast radio. The first step is to negotiate to cancel the broadcasting stations established by foreign merchants. Those who are unwilling to cancel will bid to buy them. The acquisition of the Beiping Zengmao Foreign Company Broadcasting Station and the Shanghai Meilingdun Company Broadcasting Station (call sign Xqhc, the earliest and most prestigious broadcasting station established by foreign merchants in Shanghai) this spring is a clear example. The second step is to realize that passive banning is not the best policy, so there is a design for a national broadcasting station network, and it is decided to establish a newest, large-power, and beautiful broadcasting station in Shanghai in the shortest period of time. This is really good news for wireless radio listeners across the country.</p>
<h3>The Significance of Regulations on Collecting and Finding Change for Telegram Fees</h3>
<p>— Baozhen</p>
<p>Currently, domestic telegrams are charged at a rate of ten cents per word. International telegrams are charged in French francs, but within China, they are converted into silver dollars based on the exchange rate for gold francs. Therefore, the cost per word for international telegrams, when converted to silver dollars, is difficult to make into a whole number. Moreover, both domestic and international telegrams often have additional fees such as distribution fees, translation fees, proofreading fees, etc., which may not always be whole numbers. Consequently, the total telegram fee often has fractions of a dollar. Although China's currency system is based on the decimal system, auxiliary coins like "jiao" (dimes) and "fen" (cents), besides the major cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Ping where corner notes from Central, China, Communications, and China Farmers Banks are already circulating, are not widely used in other inland areas. Most places use small silver coins (double dimes) and copper coins, which are subject to premiums. These premiums vary by time and location, making it inconsistent. Furthermore, telegraph offices nationwide are now co-located with post offices, or they mutually set up postal branch offices and telegraph collection points. Postal and telegraph offices should handle silver exchange rates in the same way to ensure uniformity. Otherwise, discrepancies can easily cause misunderstandings among the public. Recognizing this, the Ministry of Communications has stipulated regulations on collecting and finding change for telegram fees, instructing all bureaus to comply. The main points of these regulations are summarized below:</p>
<p>(A) In areas where silver dollar subsidiary coins are in circulation, telegraph bureaus should handle the collection and finding of change for telegram fees according to the following methods: (1) When a telegraph bureau needs to provide change less than one dollar, it should use silver dollar subsidiary notes as much as possible, and postage stamps may be used for change less than one dime. Telegram senders should also ideally do the same when paying telegram fees less than one dollar. For example, if the total cost of the telegram and translation fee is one dollar and two dimes and one cent, the sender can pay one silver dollar, two dimes in subsidiary notes, and one cent in postage stamps. Otherwise, if the sender asks the telegraph bureau to provide change for two silver dollars, the telegraph bureau should provide seven dimes in subsidiary notes and nine cents in postage stamps. (2) If the telegram sender does not use silver dollar subsidiary notes or postage stamps to pay for the fraction of a dollar or dime, but instead uses small silver coins or copper coins, or a combination of silver dollar subsidiary notes and small silver or copper coins, the exchange rate for converting small silver or copper coins into silver dollars should be based on the exchange rate officially set by the local post office. (3) To prepare adequately for finding change, telegraph bureaus in the aforementioned areas should estimate the number of silver dollar subsidiary notes needed each month or week and purchase them in bulk from Central, China, and Communications Banks for use.</p>
<p>(B) In areas where silver dollar subsidiary notes are not yet in circulation, telegraph bureaus should handle the collection and finding of change for telegram fees according to the following methods: (1) For telegram fees of fifty cents or less, the telegram sender should pay with auxiliary coins (including copper coins, copper coin notes, silver dimes, and dime notes?) according to the exchange rate officially announced by the local post office, or use five-cent and one-cent postage stamps. Otherwise, if the sender requests the telegraph bureau to provide change for a silver dollar, the telegraph bureau may provide change in five-cent and one-cent postage stamps. (2) For telegram fees of fifty-one cents or more, the telegram sender may pay with auxiliary coins (including silver dimes, dime notes, copper coins, and copper coin notes) according to the exchange rate officially announced by the local post office, or request the telegraph bureau to provide change in auxiliary coins according to the exchange rate officially announced by the local post office. According to the second method mentioned above, the telegram sender may not use postage stamps for payment. If the sender requests the telegraph bureau to provide change for a silver dollar, the telegraph bureau may not use postage stamps as change unless the sender voluntarily accepts them.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications has issued detailed regulations on collecting and finding change for telegram fees, the significance of which is mainly: (1) In areas where silver dollar subsidiary notes are in circulation, telegram services are busier. Telegram clerks can directly use silver dollar subsidiary notes and postage stamps for the collection and finding of change, eliminating the trouble of calculating premiums for converting small silver and copper coins into silver dollars, reducing collection time, and indirectly increasing telegraph transmission speed. (2) Telegram clerks cannot deliberately raise or lower silver exchange rates to profit from the difference. (3) Standardizing silver exchange rates between postal and telegraph bureaus. This is indeed convenient for telegram senders.</p>
<h3>On Television</h3>
<p>— Shilang</p>
<p>Wireless television is the greatest invention in electrical science in recent years. European and American experts are deeply engaged in research, and it may be commercially available in the near future. (Germany has already opened it.) China's telecommunications industry has long lagged behind. How can we not urgently catch up with television? I have read the January issue of Wireless Age, published in Washington, which contains texts discussing television issues by various electrical experts, and I have translated them for reference.</p>
<p>Translator's note</p>
<p>Television Evolved from Image Transmission Research – Sarnotf</p>
<p>I believe that in the future, wireless science will advance to image transmission, which is the road to successful television. Since Morse invented the telegraph, there has been no thorough reform in telegraph science. The English telegraph code has been in international use for many years, but our current television will greatly advance telegraph science. We transmit pictures, printed materials, etc., through the air, using a telegraph key to regulate transmission. The message does not require the continuation of dots and dashes, but is "brushed" with light, drawn line by line, and then completed with a flash of light. The first step is transmitting pictures and printed matter, which is radio image transmission, and the second step is transmitting moving pictures, which is television. But first, a fast communication medium must be found. Marconi discovered a microscopic wave that is a small wave in the ether's purple light, unaffected by static electricity and attenuation. Researching television helps image transmission broadcasting, and the results of image transmission research can advance television. I know its progress will be very rapid.</p>
<p>Television in the Laboratory – V. L. Hogan</p>
<p>During many new inventions in radio broadcasting, the public raised a question: "Why is there still no television broadcasting business today?" But in fact, there are already television stations in operation, but they are all in the experimental stage and have no formal programs open to the audience. In my opinion, the reason why there are no such programs open to the broadcast audience is due to the lack of a complete plan to form the substantive elements of this business. There are three elements: (1) The television transmitter should have perfect protection, (2) There should be interesting program materials sufficient for transmission, (3) Television receivers must be widely distributed to users at reasonable prices, and must play excellent films to satisfy users' desires in business, not just arouse curiosity.</p>

<p>I firmly believe that in 1935, we can see real commercial television indoors, giving us black and white films of 200 lines, the size of which is 18 square inches to 3 square feet, and does not require cathode rays. When playing, flash image transmission will also be realized on the screen at the same time. However, whether there is commercial interest in playing recordable images indoors remains to be discussed. In terms of engineering feasibility, there is no doubt from any of the three proven methods, but it is only an economic issue.</p>
<p>How to make television popular will encounter many prerequisites, which must be successfully resolved in the future.</p>
<h3>American Transpacific Wireless Telephone Station (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Jian</p>
<p>Manila Transmitting Station KKH7.520C/S (39.9m.) KAX19.980C/S (15.0m.) DAY14.980C/S (20.0m.) KAZ9.990C/S (30.0m.)</p>
<p>Java Bandoeng Transmitting Station PLE18.830C/S (15.9m.) PLV9,415C/S (31.9m.)</p>
<p>5. Operational Methods Because San Francisco to Hawaii and other three locations only use one complete wireless radio to communicate, only one wireless telephone communication circuit can be established at any given time. The current scheduled daily business communication times for the United States and these three locations are listed below:</p>
<p>Java 15.00-15.30 and 24.00 24.30G.M.T</p>
<p>Hawaii 18.30-O2.30G.M.T</p>
<p>Philippines 15.30-16.30 and 24.30-O2.30G.M.T</p>
<p>Note: On Sundays, the communication time at each location is mostly shortened.</p>
<p>The business communication time may be revised at any time after consultation and agreement between the communication locations concerned. Therefore, the above timetable only shows the current communication method and should not be regarded as permanent.</p>
<p>Before each call, the San Francisco and Hawaii stations must meet at the agreed wavelength. If either party is waiting for a call, it should be connected immediately if it is possible. After the call is completed, each should stop the transmitter, but the radio should remain in the tuned state so that it can meet immediately when called at any time.</p>
<p>The Point Reyes Radio Station must listen to the pre-arranged wavelengths emitted by the other transmitting stations during the specified communication time. And when the San Francisco station is called, if the transmitter in the Dixon area is not communicating with other stations, it should use the machine to work, otherwise it should quickly end the conversation to communicate with the caller.</p>

<h3>Another New Offering from the Local International Radio Station</h3>
<p>— Hao</p>
<p>—The Shanghai Telegraph Bureau's Various Receiving and Sending Offices Collect International Telegrams on Behalf—</p>
<p>The local international radio station, considering that the city is vast and there are many foreign merchants, and that the original two receiving and sending offices located in Renji Road Sassoon Building and Aiduya Road Telegraph Office are insufficient and merchants are quite far from sending telegrams, has specially negotiated with the local telegraph bureau that from April 1, all receiving and sending offices of the bureau will collect international wireless telegrams on behalf, using cash or the international station's receipt book. The locations of each receiving and sending office are listed in detail below for those sending international telegrams to send telegrams from the nearest telegraph office in the post office without having to travel far: (1) Shanghai Telegraph Main Bureau, Fuzhou Road, (2) Republic Road Telegraph Receiving and Sending Office, (3) North Sichuan Road Postal Administration, (4) Nanshi Bund Post Office, (5) Pudong Post Office, (6) Youheng Road Post Office, (7) East Xihua Road Post Office, (8) End of North Sichuan Road Post Office, (9) Jielu Post Office, (10) Kader Road Post Office, (11) Xinzha Road Post Office, (12) Fujian Road Post Office, (13) Kaiser Road Post Office, (14) Gongguan Road Post Office, (15) West Gate Post Office, (16) Li Ma Road Post Office, (17) Xiafei Road Post Office, (18) Tilanqiao Post Office, (19) Xujiahui Post Office, (20) Gaochangmiao Post Office, (21) Yuyuan Road Post Office, (22) Kangti Road Post Office, (23) Seymour Road Post Office, (24) Bailinan Road Post Office, (25) Baoding Road Post Office, (26) Central District Telegraph Receiving and Sending Office.</p>
<p>All of the above locations have dedicated telephone equipment. All international telegrams are immediately transmitted to the international radio station's telegraph room by telephone for transmission abroad, which can guarantee speed!</p>
<h3>News</h3>
<p>Report on the Restoration of Hongjiang Electric Wires</p>
<p>It has been found that for several months, communication between your bureau and various provinces has been interrupted by wired circuits, relying entirely on wireless radio stations for communication. Recently, since the communist bandits fled to Guizhou, the bandit suppression army has gathered in Guizhou Province, resulting in extremely congested official telegrams. The capacity of the radio station is limited, and delays are unavoidable. In view of this, the Ministry of Communications has specifically instructed the relevant telegraph bureaus in the two provinces of Guizhou and Guizhou to expedite the restoration of the electric wires from Hongjiang to Guiyang in order to clear up telegram services. It is now heard that the line has been restored and is open for communication. All official military telegrams have been switched to wired circuits for transmission, while commercial telegrams are still transmitted on wireless circuits to expedite them.</p>
<p>Opening of the Ningxia and Yulin Radio Stations for Communication</p>
<p>To facilitate telecommunications in the border areas, the Ministry of Communications has added a radio station each in Ningxia and Yulin in Shaanxi Province. After a long period of preparation, they are now officially open for communication. The Ningxia station communicates with the Lanzhou, Guisui, and Zhangjiakou stations. The Yulin station communicates with the Nanjing, Xi'an, Lanzhou, and Tianjin stations. In the future, communication between these two places and various provinces will be exceptionally rapid.</p>

<p>Talks</p>
<h3>China Has Not Yet Found Itself Culturally</h3>
<p>— Fool</p>
<p>American educator Dr. Monroe recently discussed with guests that what he called the most meaningful movement of our new era is the emergence and revival of Eastern culture. He said he believed that China has not yet found itself politically and culturally. I fundamentally cannot talk about belief with friends who wear square hats from abroad, but I very much believe what he said the other day that our country has not yet found itself politically and culturally.</p>
<p>Speaking of politics, I have absolutely no political common sense, so whether we have found ourselves or not, I will leave that aside for now. As for what is called culture (part of which also includes politics), there is both material and spiritual culture. I will also leave aside material culture for now. Regarding spiritual culture, it includes all literature, art, religion, language, customs, ethics, etc. Therefore, the definition of the word "culture," as Mr. Liang Rengong said, is "the valuable collective work created by the human mind," which is culture.</p>
<p>When talking about culture, there are different ideas between the new and the old, diverging and going to extremes. For example, when talking about literature and art, the new ones want to completely abandon Chinese studies and advocate for so-called mass language, Latinization, etc. The old ones advocate reading the classics and talking about "the mandate of heaven is nature" and "the way of the great learning," etc. One is like "calling every bearded man uncle," and the other is putting on red robes and gauze hats and strutting around. The distance between the two is so great that even if Sun Wukong were to do a few somersaults, I am afraid he would still not be able to reach it.</p>
<p>Looking at women, the new ones not only wear shoes barefoot but even advocate nude parades, while the old ones almost want to send all women back to their rooms to read their "Instructions for Women's Quarters" and "Daughter's Classic," bind their three-inch golden lilies, and abide by their three obediences and four virtues. These two completely conflicting ideas are mostly manifestations of discovering their own faults, which is what Dr. Monroe meant by not yet finding themselves. Therefore, Dr. Monroe said that the East has always believed in the truth of its own culture, but this culture must be modified to make it applicable to the world of the new era. This statement is really worth noting.</p>
<p>To find oneself, one must first know oneself. To know oneself, one must first have the ability to judge the merits of new and old cultures. One's own inherent culture, if it does not fit the new era, should be discarded as quickly as possible. If it fits the new era, it should be preserved as much as possible. Otherwise, it is like supporting a drunk, who leans to the east and then to the west, but never finds the true face of Mount Lu.</p>
<h3>Cormorant Boats</h3>
<p>— Yefei</p>
<p>Outside of Xukou, on the shore of Shuidongtan, there is a row of thatched huts lined up, all inhabited by people who have been forced to leave their hometowns by natural disasters and human calamities and have drifted here to build straw huts. Their lives mostly depend on fishing. Although there are also some who are small vendors and short-term workers, they are few in number.</p>
<p>The scenery of Shuidongtan is originally not bad, with mountains on three sides and water on one side. A long and winding embankment stretches out on the edge of Taihu Lake. Dense willows and peach trees are planted on both sides of the bank. On the left, there are small bridges and lotus ponds, and on the right is a large field of reeds. At the head of the lotus pond is a plum forest.</p>
<p>At the end of the embankment, there are more than a dozen small boats moored. Each boat is home to twenty or thirty cormorant boats, some stretching their necks and looking at the sky, some sticking their beaks into their wings to groom their feathers, and some crouching on the steps with their heads retracted to rest.</p>
<p>In the evening, the boat owner brings a basin of soft tofu, which they snatch and swallow. And they still seem not to have eaten enough, flapping their wings and clamoring at their owner.</p>
<p>Every day, when a bit of fish-belly white appears in the east, the sound of the fifth watch bell being struck from Xukou Town is still being sent over, and the many water crows—cormorants—boats here move one by one towards the head of Shanzhu. The sky gradually brightens, and the trees on the mountain beach can be vaguely discerned in the dim light, and the stars are all sneaking away; the gray-colored curtain of heaven seems to be about to tear.</p>
<p>One by one, small boats drift on this vast lake. Whenever they reach a place, the boat owner only needs to lightly skim the pole, and the cormorants standing on the sides of the boat splash and dive into the water. After the small boat has floated in a circle of about ten feet on the lake, these cormorants jump back onto the sides of the boat one by one, some with a fish in their mouths, and some still with empty mouths. The owner squeezes the fish down and, as usual, gives them a meal of tofu. After eating, they are allowed to rest for a while before being driven into the water to fish in another location.</p>
<p>Among the dozen or so water crow boats, Uncle Shun's is the oldest, and the small wooden boat is as old and more dilapidated than the others. At the same time, because he has been doing this job for the longest time, his experience is also richer than others. He can not only predict sunny and cloudy days, strong and light winds, but also predict where there will be more or fewer fish. For this reason, his peers have given him many nicknames, such as "Water Eye" and "Fish God"!</p>
<p>Uncle Shun has been doing this job in his hometown since he was young. Since the flood washed away his home five years ago, he has drifted here with a group of refugees. He is now a lonely old man. Originally, he also had an only son, who should be thirty-three years old now, but unfortunately, he left him and passed away ten years ago! His wife also fell ill and died because she missed her son too much, so he became a loner, and also because of the natural disaster, he wandered to this foreign land.</p>
<p>There are a total of twenty or thirty families who have come here, all building their own thatched huts to live in. Some families did not engage in fishing before, but because of the problem of livelihood, they have now come to do this industry as well. However, they mostly have a home in a thatched hut, while Uncle Shun has nothing but a broken small boat and twenty bald-headed water crows to rely on. However, it seems that he has never thought about these things. He only knows that every day he catches fish to exchange for rice and wine. Wine is his second life. At least five or six hours of the twenty-four hours are spent awake in a drunken land. He lightly buries this lonely year in this drunken land...</p>

<h3>Songs from the Cage (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Qin Jian</p>
<p>I felt a deep suspicion and suppression.</p>
<p>Perhaps when they were captured from the wilderness of nature, the hunters had used the magnificent brilliance of the golden cage and the yolk rice to lure them, or perhaps they had used the black copper quick gun and the authoritative, ferocious smile to threaten them, or perhaps, in cunning and deception, they had set up active traps to trick them. Thus: perhaps when they were hungry, they mustered up the courage to peck at the grains in front of the cage, even though they knew it was dangerous, but for the sake of survival, who could care? And some, in the muzzle of the gun and the smoke, lost their strength, and then a large and hard hand reached out, cruel and immovable, and then suddenly grabbed them tightly, and then inevitably sent them into the cage filled with bars,</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>Want them to sing there forever, singing.</p>
<p>However, what is sung is the unpleasant roar in the cage, but this roar is left for the happy, people who are forever without sorrow, without grief, to yearn for and appreciate!</p>
<p>Weeping sadly, angry, screaming; but what is full of insulting, mocking eyes outside the bars: "Be quiet, little thing, you have to act cute and make us happy - this is your duty, and also a predestined, unshakable eternal fate!"</p>
<p>Is it true? Yes, maybe it is really the "eternal" (all terrible!) fate of these beautiful little animals? People snatched them from the free world and put them in cages for no reason; there, in people's inadvertent play, youth passed away, the brown twilight shone before their eyes, and finally, the body lost its plumpness, the feathers lost their luster, and the voice lost its roundness, so, in people's frowns and disgust, carrying depression, carrying the never-ending longing for freedom, they died silently in the cage, in indifference.</p>
<p>Perhaps they are forever remembering a small grass, a drop of spring water in the great free world? Perhaps they are singing the little songs in the bitter cage朝朝暮暮without interruption? But the main thing is to prepare yourself, to be strong!</p>
<p>In constant efforts--</p>
<p>The mouth will one day become sharp, the sound will one day become powerful, and the bars of the cage will one day collapse!</p>
<h3>Insomnia</h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>I haven't slept well for several nights. I don't have experience with insomnia, so I dare not lightly take sleeping pills. A friend introduced me to an internal medicine specialist who returned from Germany. So, without going through registration procedures, I stepped directly into the pure white-themed examination room. I first presented my friend's business card. After some pleasantries, he began to ask me about my symptoms, such as diet, daily routine, bowel movements, work, etc., in great detail, but everything seemed normal. The "DR" who returned from Germany started pacing in the small examination room, his right index finger and thumb pressing on his chin, constantly rubbing the stubble hardened by his security razor. He occasionally peered at me with a detective-like gaze over the edge of his thick glasses, as if suspecting I was deliberately hiding some symptoms. Finally, he stopped pacing and tapped the glass table with his fingers, politely requesting to examine my lungs. Naturally, I couldn't refuse his diagnosis, especially since he was considering my illness so seriously. I undressed without hesitation. But he immediately stopped me, exclaiming urgently, "You'll catch a cold! You'll catch a cold!" He instructed his assistant to turn on the electric heater in the inner room and invited me inside. Taking advantage of this brief moment, he told me that Chinese people pay too little attention to coughs and colds, thinking they are minor ailments, when in fact, many incurable diseases originate from them. Moreover," he emphasized, "everything, from diet to daily routine, is too careless, so inexplicable symptoms often occur!" I don't know if he was deliberately paying attention to me, but my face gradually flushed. Fortunately, he examined my lungs, chest, and back for a long time, then pressed his fingers on his chin again and exited the inner room with me. Sitting down across the glass table, without waiting for me to ask, he said softly, "Very strange, no symptoms at all! Occasionally not sleeping well for a few days is not an illness! It's nothing serious!" He scribbled a prescription with his Parker pen, which turned out to be for sleeping pills.</p>
<p>The doctor was exceptionally polite, escorting me to the examination room door, shaking my hand goodbye, and finally advising me: "Go to bed early at night, don't overthink!"</p>
<p>Outside the door, the spring sun scattered across the street like an unbridled wild horse, and a soft breeze carrying an unknown fragrance wafted into my nostrils. As if a condemned prisoner had been suddenly released, I took a deep breath and unknowingly walked into the park. It wasn't a weekday, and the park wasn't as lively as usual. I found an iron sofa by the small river, and gazing at the lush flowers and trees, I felt unusually invigorated, certainly not the symptom of someone suffering from insomnia. "Yes, there's nothing wrong!" I firmly remembered the doctor's words.</p>
<p>After returning home, I searched for a book of health knowledge on my bookshelf and turned to the section on restful sleep: "Dinner should not be too heavy, avoid drinking tea, smoking, or consuming stimulating foods or drinks, such as coffee, before bed, avoid reading; wash feet before bed…" To prevent insomnia, I followed everything to the letter—a truly unusual action for me. Smoking and drinking Longjing tea had become habits, and I always had to read a few pages before I could close my eyes. I turned off the lights and went to bed, warning myself not to overthink. Sure enough, I fell into a sweet sleep.</p>
<p>When the cries of a midnight food vendor awoke me, I couldn't fall back asleep. Looking at the glass window, I saw the belly of white gradually brightening, marking the passage of another day.</p>
<p>"It's not an illness! It's nothing serious!" I often murmured the doctor's words, hesitating and unable to decide.</p>
<h3>A Brief Letter by the Rain Window</h3>
<p>— Peng</p>
<p>My dear friend ×, spring has come quietly and is fading away quietly. Last year, when the peach blossoms were in full bloom, we took some time off to go to Zhenjiang. That night, returning from the Purple Bamboo Forest, I suddenly had a severe cough. That was our last night in Zhenjiang, and we excitedly went to Baota Forest. Do you remember? We even made some youthful jokes. But this year—according to friends returning from Qihua, the peach blossoms have already withered almost completely! Every day, I seek bread in numbers, completely unaware of spring or summer! Yet you say time passes too quickly; sometimes it doesn't seem so: thinking back to when we soared like swallows in the vast sky and sea, it almost feels like a previous century. Recently, you've been unemployed, perhaps feeling time passes even slower: isn't that right? This reminds me of distant stories? It seems I never used to think about my job, and our lives were relaxed and natural! The dreams of that golden age! Now, we've reached a premature middle age! Sitting alone by the window, listening to the rain pattering against the glass, I often shed tears of sentimentality in private. Yes, I'm too weak; yet do you have the courage to embrace some great hope for a hazy future? Ah, forgive me, I've said things I shouldn't have.</p>
<p>Last week, I had tea with He at Sinya on Nanjing Road. Remember, I'm not putting on airs; I just thought of this relatively inexpensive place when we talked about boredom on the phone. We talked a lot that day, but now I can't remember what nonsense we were spouting! If we had shouted out loud, I'm afraid they would have sent me to an asylum. In that case, you can dismiss it with a smile, or perhaps you understood everything as if you were sitting next to us. However, He told me you've been reading books in seclusion lately. I don't have your good temper, but of course, I don't mean to discourage you from reading. I'm sorry that even though it's only a ten-minute walk to your house, we haven't met for weeks. He's words may be untrue; you certainly wouldn't pick up a book to become a fool. We've known each other since childhood and know you can't be bound by books. However—I hope you really enjoy it; the world lacks fools like us!</p>
<p>I don't know if you've met with He recently? I'm burdened by family shackles again: Qingming Festival, I went to my father's grave. Returning late, I couldn't catch the train back to Shanghai and spent the night in that damp room. Needless to say, things got worse that night. You at least understand the most important points of everything that's happened: it's undeniable that the family system is unsuitable for today, and the complexity of my family makes me feel chilled whenever I think of home. Four years ago, I scraped together enough money for a third-class train ticket and escaped to Shanghai. Some people gave me a thumbs-up, calling me "courageous," but perhaps it was more of a "suppression"! Yet I can't forget my father's grave, which will soon become a mound of earth, so I've finally returned to this so-called home of mine! The story is too long to tell. If you remember when we read Mushanokoji Saneatsu's "Mother and Child" under the lamp, then we won't have to talk about this annoying matter when we meet next time.</p>
<p>Now, it's raining lightly outside the window again. When the door knocker rings next door, I'm sure I'll think someone is visiting me: because we used to visit friends in raincoats often, but where are those friends now? Well then, when you recite aloud under the south window, you probably cast hopeful glances at the front door whenever the knocker sounds. In one of your moments of inattention, I will stand silently before you without making a sound, or perhaps it's happening right now.</p>
<h3>Travels in Johor</h3>
<p>— Hu Sicong</p>
<p>While driving along the coast of Singapore with a friend, Ming suddenly suggested visiting Johor for sightseeing. Although it was already dusk, the longing for this sultanate suddenly aroused everyone's interest.</p>
<p>"Let's go!"</p>
<p>So, the car gradually turned from the bustling streets into the desolate suburbs. Many buildings gradually disappeared, followed by vast coconut groves interspersed with thatched houses. The swift rubber tires rolled on the asphalt road, and the road was clear. At first, the car encountered other travelers, but they became increasingly sparse. It wasn't until we rejoined the main road to the Malay Peninsula that the traffic picked up again. As we approached the Johor Railway Bridge, we could already see the bright lights of the twilight.</p>
<p>Looking straight ahead from this end of the bridge, the iron bridge lay straight before us. The waters of the Johor Strait appeared azure, and waves crashed against the bridge pillars. Bright electric lights formed a straight line, suspended on the iron bridge, sparkling in the eyes and exceptionally refreshing. A train had just crawled across the bridge, its rumbling sound amplified in the space above the sea. Two lines of cars drove in succession, two huge eyeballs shining directly into the evening equatorial air. Our car joined this crawling procession on the bridge, and the evening breeze from the tropics brushed past us, making us feel extraordinarily cool and dispelling the daytime heat. From the gap in the sea, the sea breeze refreshed people from the drowsiness of the tropics. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Opening passage "National Flower":</p>
<p>Although the plum blossom is not the king of flowers, its character is noble and surpasses all others. Ancient poets have praised and determined it, and the world honors its reputation as the queen of flowers. The chrysanthemum is considered the hermit among flowers, and the lotus is also worthy of being called a gentleman. Zhouzi loved the lotus, and Tao loved the chrysanthemum; the interests of these two were not ordinary. Who knows that the plum is both hermit and gentleman, its nature gentle, its character noble, and its appearance dignified. People often praise peaches and plums, the peach blossoms are beautiful, and the plum blossoms are fragrant. But the plum flower is content with its position and does not want to be fashionable and learn new styles. Its elegance is unmatched, without any vulgarity, and it is ashamed to compete with peaches and plums in fragrance. It has no matchmaker, yet it is not harmed. The fairy of Miaogu originally had no lover. Its friends in the mountains are pine and bamboo, and at midnight, there is a clear breeze and moonlight. Ordinary flowers can only obey orders; who can be the first to herald the coming of spring? Therefore, it is said that when the new moon stretches its brows, all the stars shine, and when the old plum opens its mouth, a hundred flowers are busy. Who knows oneself when the world is old and desolate? They only say that the world is blind. Unexpectedly, there is still Lin Bu who is sentimental, and Meng Haoran who understands its music. Now, the designation of the national flower is even more glorious.</p>

<h3>Evelyn Venable's Confession on Marriage and "The Girl Who Doesn't Kiss"</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>Evelyn Venable is one of the most beautiful rising actresses in Hollywood. Like Jean Parker, she has a reputation for purity and innocence. It is rare and valuable for a young woman to receive such revered praise for purity and innocence, and it greatly helps their future. Now, both Evelyn Venable and Jean Parker have become rising stars. From this, we can see that a young actress trying to appeal with "flirtatiousness" and "romance" is not only unworthy but also despised, leading to her failure.</p>
<p>In films, Evelyn Venable even has a legend of being "un-kissable." But this is naturally a promotional tactic of the producers, not that she really can't be kissed. Imagine, what's the big deal about being kissed during a performance? And to insist on not kissing, with some saying her contract has a clause stipulating that she won't kiss male actors. Evelyn said, "It's not convenient to declare that I am willing to kiss male actors, but I still laugh when I think about it."</p>
<p>"Think about it, for years, the happy ending of sending the female lead into the arms of the male lead, tenderly and lovingly, has become an inalienable public right of the producers. What makes Hollywood Hollywood, and why audiences like to watch romance movies, is precisely this little bit. Who dares, who is willing to deprive the producers of this right? Certainly not me."</p>
<p>The above is Evelyn Venable's confession regarding the "not kissing" point, but what she wants to confess is not just this. It turns out that she is not only not a "non-kissing" girl, but also a young woman who deeply understands love because she is now married through love. Her romance with her husband has been going on for a year, and only now that she has told it herself does the outside world know the details. Shouldn't we ask her to confess a bit? The following are Evelyn's own words:</p>
<p>"Hollywood is hopelessly romantic and emphasizes emotion above all else. She's like a nosy old woman who, when anything emotional happens, has to dig to the bottom of it. This curiosity of hers does more harm than good. It has ruined many good marriages. Therefore, we decided to keep my engagement a secret for the time being. I wanted to tell so many times, but I didn't dare. The reason is obvious. My experience with Hollywood's publicity policies makes me afraid to speak up.</p>
<p>"I know the public spends money to see a play done by an actor, and they should have the right to know everything about him or her, otherwise, I wouldn't tell you. But what the public wants to know must be accurate. I have seen firsthand the impact of inaccurate news and inaccurate criticism on a movie actor. Therefore, I decided to keep our marriage a secret for the time being.</p>
<p>"If you knew that a million dollars worth of treasure was buried somewhere, how carefully would you keep the secret? Wouldn't you feel that telling people is an extremely dangerous and unreliable thing? Wouldn't you be constantly worried that people would find out and steal it? Similarly, I got a million-dollar treasure.</p>
<p>"This is the first time I have revealed my secret. For the past year, we have dressed up and disguised ourselves, using all sorts of methods to avoid the eyes and ears of everyone, fearing that people would find out about my treasure and steal it. It's really because Hollywood's curiosity and publicity policies are too bizarre and terrifying. As for our romance, it started like this.</p>
<p>"It was my first day filming at Fox after becoming a freelance actor. I arrived at the set and saw someone behind the camera. My heart was immediately captured by him. I asked others and learned that he was one of Hollywood's famous cinematographers, Hal Mohr. The next day, as soon as I arrived at the set, I went to find him. I told myself that I had found the person I wanted to marry. It seems unbelievable that I decided to marry him the first time I met him. But I knew my heart belonged to him. Strangely enough, Hal felt the same way. He later told me that when he saw me in the lens, he stared intently, and he said to himself that he wanted to treasure that picture forever. A week later, we got engaged.</p>
<p>"This happened so quickly that no one on the outside knew anything about it. We were happy to keep it a secret. Moreover, although my will was very firm at that time, I couldn't fully believe my personal feelings. Maybe we wouldn't become husband and wife in the future. Therefore, we both felt that a year of hesitation was necessary. If after a year, our feelings remain unchanged, then our future would feel more secure.</p>
<p>"Sure enough, we lived a year of secretive life, dodging the curious eyes of reporters, not daring to publicly express our love. But after a year, we took a plane to a place and got married. It was a beautiful day! Now, we can hold hands or hug and kiss in front of the public. There's nothing to be afraid of."</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "The Captain Hates the Sea"</h3>
<p>— Hua Lun</p>
<p>The Captain Hates the Sea — Grand Shanghai Cinema</p>
<p>"The Captain Hates the Sea" concentrates its characters and events on a steamship sailing in the ocean, allowing actors with different personalities to compete and show off their skills. In terms of script structure and the appeal of All-Star casts, it is somewhat similar to "Rome Express," which is set on a train, and "Grand Hotel," which is set in a hotel. However, looking at the overall results of the performance, although it is more lively and brighter than "Rome Express," it seems to be far from the tight structure, profound depiction, concise narration, and lively performance of "Grand Hotel."</p>
<p>Under the command of Captain Harrigan, the giant ship Sanka Parade gradually left Sun Pedro Harbor and sailed into the sea he hated. Captain Harrigan's dislike of the sea has its reasons. He doesn't hate the joys and sorrows of human relationships but is afraid of seeing the characters and accidents that are constantly discovered along the way and make his head ache.</p>
<p>These so-called characters are naturally the distinguished guests on his passenger list. Among them are a writer who has fallen out of favor in Hollywood; a skilled thief and his beautiful female assistant; a great detective tracking them; a estranged couple; a flamboyant and luxurious widow; and a crazy old traveler. Naturally, our captain can't help but get involved and play a supporting role.</p>
<p>The plot that unfolds from these characters is naturally the old pattern of love entanglements intertwined with detective cases. The ending that follows is naturally also some old tunes: "Lovers always get married." Those who were single or at odds when they boarded the ship, those who were entangled or unhappy during the journey, mostly got what they wanted and gained new or old love, pairing up and embracing as they disembarked. As for the detective case, it was naturally solved smoothly.</p>
<p>We have criticized many such empty, ordinary, and vulgar stories, so there is no need to say more here. Moreover, "The Captain Hates the Sea" can be considered to have appeared with a new structure, so let's discuss the structural aspects.</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, the structure of this script is not very clever. The author seems to have no other intention in forcefully pulling out this group of characters other than to gather actors and give each of them a role. Therefore, he cannot artistically create better connections between the characters presented. Except for the three people in the detective case having a love affair as the plot progresses, there is no reasonable plot development to connect the characters such as the frustrated writer and the flamboyant widow. Instead, the script clumsily uses the quarrels of the estranged couple and the woman's suicide as a wave, and repeats the use of several dinners as the main horizontal gathering line. Therefore, in the dry and dull atmosphere, the sudden habits of the old travelers had to be used as humorous gimmicks. Because of this contentless structure, the script has to forcibly emphasize giving each star a large amount of acting opportunities, so this shallow depiction has truly become a maze.</p>
<p>Speaking of acting, individually speaking, these actors who can act naturally have considerable achievements. These include the detective played by MacLaren, the thief played by Fred Keating, the female thief played by Helen Vincent, and the estranged couple played by Ericson and Winnie. However, looking at the entire play as a whole, they all have a feeling of working hard without achieving good results. Comparatively speaking, Walter Connolly, who plays the captain, gives the deepest impression, while John Gilbert, who plays the writer, does not seem to have the same level of performance as in other plays.</p>
<p>Director Lewis Milestone, although not as successful as "All Quiet on the Western Front," is very hardworking.</p>
<h3>Motherly Love? Sexual Love? "Spring Storm" Collection</h3>
<p>— Yunshui</p>
<p>The Secret of a Great Director: According to John M. Stahl, one of the world's great directors, his secret to success lies in revealing women's secrets. He often said that if you or I have a secret, people are not very interested in hearing it. But if that secret belongs to the opposite sex, then people will definitely rush to find out. Secondly, what can capture people's emotions is the "Eternal Triangle." The triangle doesn't necessarily have to be related to love; for example, you and I fighting for a horse, a fan, or a cup of coffee (which, of course, doesn't happen often) can be called a "triangle." Furthermore, the most important element of a good drama is natural performance. If the audience can tell that the actors are acting, then failure is already on the horizon.</p>
<p>The production cost of "Spring Storm" reached millions of gold dollars. However, viewers can also learn the secret of "one word worth ten thousand gold" in the film.</p>
<p>Ichthyology: Ichthyology is a rather novel term. Scholars of this kind probably haven't been born in China yet. But in "Spring Storm," he still managed to win the hearts of both mother and daughter as a talented and heartbroken young man.</p>
<p>Child Star Combination: The most difficult thing during the filming of "Spring Storm" was the selection of child stars, whose appearance, demeanor, and voice had to be lifelike. Even after the passage of time, they should still be vaguely recognizable, which is truly a miraculous feat. Finally, three-year-old Kiki (the widow's daughter) was played by Baby Eun, nine-year-old Kiki was played by Marilyn Knowlden (who played Agnes in "Imitation of Life"), and eighteen-year-old Kiki was played by Rochelle Hudson. Four-year-old Baolan (the black woman's daughter) was played by Sipe Henley, ten-year-old Baolan was played by Dorothy Black, and nineteen-year-old Baolan was played by Flann Washington. However, coaching them in dialogue and action was not an easy task.</p>
<p>There are many other things to say, but it is best to know when to stop.</p>
<h3>Universal Company Continues to Give Away Special "Spring Storm" Issue</h3>
<p>Universal Company's literary masterpiece "Spring Storm" is currently being screened at the Nanjing Grand Theatre. In order to enhance the audience's full understanding and appreciation of the film, the theater translated all the dialogue into Chinese and provided English translations. Last week, 20,000 copies were printed, and they were given away in less than three days. Now, thousands of people are requesting copies every day. To meet the needs of the audience, the film's producer, Universal Company, printed an additional 10,000 copies, which were released yesterday. The entire book has more than seventy pages, a color cover, and more than 100,000 words. Those who wish to request a copy can contact the American Universal Film Company at 623 Sichuan Road. However, due to the high printing costs, a cost recovery fee of five cents per copy will be charged. Mail requests should include six cents for postage (limited to half-cent stamps), it is said.</p>
<p>Movie Novel</p>
<h3>The Little Minister (I)</h3>
<p>— Zhi</p>
<p>Starring Katharine Hepburn, produced by RKO Pictures.</p>
<p>Babbie had once again run from the castle to Gardinny. She hurried through the gardens of Lord Rintoul, because she didn't want the servants to see her, especially the Duke's sister—the sharp-eyed Elena. She didn't want Babbie to come out again.</p>
<p>Babbie's unruly behavior annoyed everyone in the national castle. But she knew that she was an abandoned Gypsy girl, without any relatives, so she couldn't blame people for being dissatisfied. The Duke of Rintoul had raised her since she was a child. Elena treated her like a sister, which made her serve the Duke. Babbie grew up and was very beautiful. The Duke then decided to marry her as his wife.</p>
<p>Since the Duke intended to marry Babbie, Elena had been watching her even more closely, fearing that her Gypsy nature would be revealed. Even looking at the current situation, her actions were already unacceptable in 19th-century Scotland. Not only did she often run out alone, but she also didn't wear the clothes that a Duke's fiancée should wear, instead wearing colorful Gypsy clothes.</p>
<p>At first, Babbie didn't pay much attention to the issue of marrying the Duke. But as time passed, she began to doubt. Should she get married? The Duke was very kind to her, but he was at least twice her age.</p>
<p>Although it was noon, with the sun high in the sky, the towering old trees made the Gardinny forest as dark as night. Completely different from other places, it was so quiet that there was no sound at all. Only the chirping of birds or the rustling of leaves blown by the breeze could be heard. So Babbie often found this place as lovely as a deserted wilderness. In an instant, her unhappiness passed. She happily ran along, singing pleasant songs. Sometimes she bent down to throw a few wildflowers, and sometimes she watched the squirrels running around. She was enjoying the joy of nature when she was disturbed by some heavy sounds. She heard a heavy voice say, "Woman." She didn't recognize whose voice it was, but when she turned around, she knew it was the new minister of the Aultnaclach church in the forest village. No one else in this village wore these kinds of clothes, and she had heard people say he was the "Little Minister." Indeed, he was small, and although he tried to appear mature and steady, he still couldn't hide his youth. Because Babbie was wearing Gypsy clothes, she pretended to be a Gypsy girl, looking at him with innocent and lively eyes. Listening to him say, "Your singing has violated today's Sabbath. Have you seen the police notice? Gypsies are not allowed in this area." She said, "I can't read." The Little Minister, at a loss, read the notice posted on the tree, "Warning to those who trespass…" But she quietly ran away. The Little Minister turned around and she was gone. It turned out that she had run back to the castle like a little deer. She now remembered that the Duke was hosting Captain Halyard tonight, and she had to hurry back to get dressed.

<h3>Psychological Design of Factory Buildings</h3>
<p>— Bo Ning</p>
<p>The architecture of a factory has a significant impact on workers' health, morale, and work efficiency. If the building is suitable, the workers will be healthy in the factory, their spirits will be happy, and their work efficiency will increase significantly. Otherwise, some workers will suffer from "work-related illnesses," some will be mentally exhausted, and some will find their work boring. Not only will the workers suffer, but the factory owners will also suffer significant losses.</p>
<p>Because this issue is so serious, several basic psychological conditions must be carefully considered in factory construction:</p>
<p>(1) Site Selection: The most important factors to consider when choosing a site are, of course, land price, transportation, labor, etc. But these are economic conditions. Psychologically, the following should be noted:</p>
<p>1. It must be located far away from busy roads, railways, and other noisy environments: We often see some small factories near busy roads. Whenever funerals, weddings, or parades pass by, workers' dark heads often peek out from the small window openings. Larger factories have stricter supervision, and workers dare not recklessly leave their work to enjoy themselves. However, waves of drums and music enter the ears of these workers. Although their hands are still working, their minds are already "like swans about to arrive," and the effectiveness of their work is questionable. If there is a railway next to the factory, the train's sharp calls and the rattling of the train tracks come and go day and night, how much will they hinder the workers' attention? Therefore, when choosing a site, it is best not to be located near busy roads as much as possible, and also to be far away from railways and other noisy areas.</p>
<p>2. The location must be high and dry, and the environment must be clean: If the factory's base is too low-lying, not only will the building's foundation not be very stable, and the machinery will be easily damaged. Workers will often get sick, and their emotional lives will also be very poor. Their tempers will worsen, they will easily get angry, and they will be depressed. Not only will work efficiency decrease, but they will also be difficult to manage, and disputes will often occur, leading to turmoil. If there are unclean areas near the factory buildings, the unpleasant odors generated by the sun's scorching can also affect the workers' abilities.</p>
<p>(2) Things to Know When Building a Model: The factory's design should at least consider the following two points:</p>
<p>1. The size of the workshop and the distance between the workshops: If the workshop is too small, the workers and machinery will be too crowded. Not only will it be difficult to regulate the air, but this crowded environment will make the workers feel very irritable, eventually leading to a dislike of work, and work efficiency will be greatly reduced. However, the workshop cannot be too large either. If it is too large, not only will the construction be uneconomical, but the workers' attention will also be easily distracted and not very focused.

<h3>Building Materials Science</h3>
<p>— Zhu Zhenmu</p>
<p>(X)</p>
<p>Chapter 6: Copper</p>
<p>Section 1: Overview of Copper</p>
<p>Copper ore is mostly produced in Japan, Chile, Mexico, Africa, and other places, and many European countries also produce it. Some of the ore contains pure copper ore, while others contain a compound, but all have more than 90% copper content, so copper ore is very easy to mine and refine.</p>
<p>The copper described in this chapter is red copper, not brass or white copper, because brass and white copper are alloys and will be described separately in later chapters.</p>
<p>Section 2: Copper Refining</p>
<p>Copper refining can be divided into five steps: panning, roasting, melting, copperization, and purification:</p>
<p>(1) Panning: The panning step is not necessary, but it is required for those with a low copper content. The principle of panning is that light and clear substances float on top, while heavy and turbid substances sink. There is no other reason. The method can be further divided into the following three steps:</p>
<p>Step 1: Oil Immersion - Grind the ore into a fine powder and put it into an aqueous solution containing 1% kerosene, so that the oil film adheres to the outside of the sand particles.</p>
<p>Step 2: Flotation - Pour the above sand immersion liquid into a larger water tank and stir it with a square to make the light and clear ones float to the top and the heavy and turbid ones sink to the bottom.</p>
<p>Step 3: Skimming - Since the light ones have floated up and are useless here, they can be skimmed off, and then pure ore is obtained at the bottom of the bucket.</p>
<p>(2) Roasting: Roasting means directly burning the ore with fire to remove various substances that are easily gasified from the ore, such as arsenic, etc. At the same time, roasting can oxidize three-quarters of the sulfur content in the ore. This oxygen can be converted from the mixed iron ore, and at the same time, the iron ore also combines with sulfur to form iron sulfide, so after roasting, some pure copper can be obtained.</p>
<p>(3) Melting: Add silica sand to the already roasted ore and melt it at the same time. Then the silica sand combines with iron oxide to form floating slag, which separates itself from the copper. Adding lime can make it easier to burn and separate the copper even further. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Architectural Jargon (9)</h3>
<p>— Mei Zhenhuan</p>
<p>— Regarding the use of construction sites —</p>
<p>Needle Insertion: When bricklayers are building walls, they must place a wooden brick (described earlier) every one or two feet in places where there should be skirting, lining, and picture molding. However, some bricklayers often do not listen to the supervisors and build the walls haphazardly as if they were playing a game. They neglect to leave out the wooden bricks. When the brick walls are plastered and ready for the carpenters to start working, the difficulty follows. It turns out that in the places where the wooden bricks were missed, the carpenters have to go through an extra procedure. This procedure is needle insertion. But what does needle insertion mean? It means inserting small, sharpened pieces of wood that have been shaped with an axe into the wall that is originally intended to be decorated. If this is not done, the bricks cannot withstand the pulling force. The skirting and other decorations will probably break or fall off easily soon. The use of needle insertion is a good way to remedy the omission of wooden bricks.</p>
<p>Tounge and Groove: Spruce boards that are one inch and six inches or one inch and four inches thick are used for flooring. (Some are one inch and two inches thick. However, most are Luan and Jeck.) The places on both sides that resemble male and female bamboo shoots (Join) are called Tounge and Groove. So flooring is also called tongue and groove boards. For this kind of tongue and groove, carpenters use clamps (described earlier) to make the arrangement tighter when laying the floor.</p>
<p>Chamfer: The door or window jamb that is intended for decoration is slightly wider. This is called a chamfer.</p>
<p>Air Leak: The distance between the lower header of the door or window and the ground or window sill is too large. There is naturally an opening in the middle. This opening is called an air leak.</p>
<p>Water Shield: A thin, sloping board is installed on the outer end of the door or window, below the header, to prevent rainwater from flowing back into the house. This board is called a water shield board.</p>
<p>Corbel: If a house has a balcony, the sides below the balcony are the corbels. The shape of the corbels resembles a cow's leg, hence the name. It has a load-bearing capacity under pressure. Most of them are made of reinforced concrete and sand.</p>
<p>Sleeper Wall: In more elaborate houses, the difference between the bottom and the floor is not as simple as in ordinary houses, where the sleepers are arranged on the three-in-one sand and soil and the floor is laid. It has at least three feet of space. But for the arrangement of the floor, if the area is slightly wider, then the sleepers arranged on the two walls are not easy to bear the load under pressure. At this time, a wall is built in the middle of the space. This wall is called a sleeper wall. (To be continued)</p>
