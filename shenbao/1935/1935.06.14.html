<p>— 紀</p>
<p>日本新任駐華大使有吉明。當此河北風雲黯淡之秋。重蒞吾國。並定今日呈遞國書。據稱此來負有「促進中日提携，以奠定東亞和平基礎」之重大使命。此語誠為吾人所樂聞。惟觀感所及。頗覺有不能已于言者。乘茲大使抵任之際。放貢數語。以當芻蕘。</p>
<p>中日兩國。同處東亞。隔水相望。就歷史。種族。文化。經濟諸端言。均有互相提携之必要。東亞大國。首推中日。而握東亞政治之樞紐。與代表東方文明之精神者。亦僅此兩國。故奠定東亞和平。確惟中日是賴。中日兩國旣有如斯深切之關係。理應眞誠相見。以平等互惠之精神。尊重彼此之主權與利益。第史實所昭示。莫不與此背道而馳。寗非怪事。吾人推其根本原因。厥為日本過去對華抱有侵略觀念之錯誤。故居今日而欲求中日提携之促進。使兩國關係。益臻親善端在日方一轉念之間耳。吾人所望于日方者。去其偽。立其誠。消除其夙昔所抱之侵略觀念與旣成之侵略事實。以平等之眼光。互惠之誠意對待中國。俾我國全國上下。得一釋其對日所懷之疑懼心理。此實為促進兩國關係之先決條件。</p>
<p>吾人按諸史實。中日兩國感情之隔閡。率皆發生於侵略事實旣成以後。但近觀日方朝野之言論。莫不斤斤以對華根絕「排日敎育」與「抵貨運動」為政策之中心。實則中國根本無所謂排日敎育。而近年來。亦無公開之抵貨運動。至紀念國恥。提倡國貨鼓吹民族之自力更生。固任何獨立國家理所應有之舉。卽使有若干點略予日方以不愉快之感。亦屬日方旣往事實之反應。日方茍就民族獨立之觀點。對此等問題。考察其因果。當能釋然於懷。而覺過去對華政策之非計也。</p>
<p>以上二者。為中日提携之中心問題。其解決之關鍵。完全操諸日本。所謂「解鈴還待擊鈴人」。實為消泯中日感情隔閡之至理名言。吾人對於中日兩國使節之昇格。懷有甚大之希望。蓋大使較諸公使。地位記崇。權力亦大。在國際外交之活動上。自亦較為便利。　日本對華之二重性外交。自兩國互換大使後。未始無改變之可能。且此舉顯係日本以平等地位待我之初　。此後兩國關係。或能轉入改善之途。亦未可知。抑尤有進者。日使有吉駐華已近二年。對於吾國國情。閱歷旣深。對事實之認識。諒亦較為正確甚望此後能以真誠之態度。與我國人相見。以平等互惠之精神。求兩國民族利益之發展。同時更能進步從事旣成侵略事實之解除。俾東亞之永久和平得以奠定。若然。則受其賜　。豈僅中日兩國而已哉。</p>

<p>茶號緊縮　祁茶過去、因歐美銷路浩大市價逐年提漲、設莊製茶老、亦隨之增加、民國十九年、全縣茶號、計有九十餘家、二十年增至一百十四家二十一年更增至一百八十二家、去年减少二十餘家、今年開業者共有一百三十七家（內有合作社二十餘家）又較舊减少三十餘家、其减少原因、即因原有茶號、受頻年之折閱、資盡難以開塲、卽今年復業之號、對營業方針、無不多從緊縮力求减輕成本、免再虧負、此種步驟、號商似趨一致、然而事實上、竟大謬不然、當新茶上市、少數號商之捷足競爭心、總難革泯、彼淡此熱、你抑我提、山價還是難趨劃一、致成本又因之增高、兼之本年號多產歉、形成求過於供往年各號、每家箱數、多在二三百箱以外、今歲普通每家只有百數十箱、滿二百箱者、不過十零家箱數雖然减少、而號中開支、不能因箱少而隨减、每家都在二千餘元至三千餘元不等、此外再加每箱正附稅二元餘、（本年較上年約增數倍）運費五六元、及上海棧租保險佣金等、總計首批箱茶成本、每担均須一百七八十元之間無形中成本增大、是茶號之求營業緊縮、輕本免負之初旨、至此又自無把握矣、</p>
<p>同戶痛苦　祁邑農民、自耕稻糧、旣不敷食、一年土產收入、除採掘瓷士運銷景德鈸外、莫不眼巴巴望着茶葉之產豐價善、來舒其窮困之生活、在祁紅鼎盛之年山戶茶價所得、均校婺源休歙爲豐、因婺休綠茶、一次焙乾出售每担最高價不過七八十元、祁茶非一次焙乾粟中含水分成半乾式茶坏、出售茶號、每百斤最高價可得百二三十元僅及焙乾綠茶分量之半、兩祖折合爲一、價亦倍之、此不過指祁山戶茶葉售價之總收入而言、再計其採茶人工伙食所出實際收入、亦非豐厚、因祁邑茶戶多非自採、摘製須雇外來工人、卽以本年毛紅茶統扯平均價格、每担約二十元計、僅敷做工成本、產戶所獲、數甚稀微、又以全縣今歲產額二萬五千担計、茶農收入、不過七十五萬元統扯除去人工之半數、流入全縣山戶、祗三十七萬五千元、整個農村收入、爲數有限、岑蹄之水、實無補於焦枯、雖本年平里茶葉改良塲、及全國經委會、爲救濟農村、解除茶戶痛苦、派員指導組織茶葉運銷合作社、每村限定家、社員卽爲自有茶產之農民、一切設備、均由該塲經會技正、訓練指示、資金由上海銀行貸借、在當局固救濟有心、辦法亦不爲不善、但其間仍有少數不良份子、從中操縱或假借組社、暗施其壓剝茶農之故技、故合作社於茶農個人本身利益、在未嚴密糾織成績顯著以前、尙難予茶農得到實惠普沾之效果、</p>
<p>金融欠靈　過去祁邑茶號之蓬勃、雖由海外銷價暢高、半亦由銀根寬活所致、在七八年前、滬上茶棧、爲競爭箱額增加、對接客放欵、大多鬆濫無度、每年各棧貸與茶號茶銀、嘗有二百萬元上下、近年因外銷不暢、號商虧折纍纍、棧方被累之損失爲數甚巨、旋經棧商議訂新章、防止　累、互相遵守施行後、棧放號欵、咸主緊縮、故邇歲多數茶號之經營、旣感自資之薄弱、棧欵又不易予所貸求、袖短難舞、俱苦羅掘皆窮　去年雖有四省農民銀行派員駐祁放欵、首計其一個月貸出總額、僅有二萬餘元、數甚稀微　仍不能助長金融之靈活　今歲各茶棧因受銀錢業局用放欵之緊閉、來源艱澀、對茶號用銀寸頭益形短薪、總計本年各棧在祁貸出欵額、只有八十餘萬元、（每家貸借數目至多六千元少至三千元）再加各號自身之三四成本金、總共不過一百二三十萬元、以五六萬箱之祁茶生產巨額、僅賴此百餘萬元資金以周轉其何能濟、若言發展、更戞乎其難也、</p>
<p>銷價滯落　生產與消費、兩者缺一不可、蓋有生產而無銷塲、則息膨脹過剩、今日祁茶之衰落則苦出路不暢迪、更苦市價之逐年低賤、銷塲狹、市價高、營者尙可沾利、再次市價平、不傷本、茶商猶可支持、無如近數年來、銷價兩者、遞趨滯落、縱茶號擁有豐資、亦不堪頻蝕不已、此祁茶受銷價之壓迫、各至筋疲力盡、陷入深淵而莫由自援矣、去年茶商熱望、滿冀海外市情好轉、稍補前虧、詎首抵新茶上市、銷盤依舊不動、總計上月份、祁浮兩路箱茶運滬、共有一萬五千餘箱、祁貢頂盤、僅開一百六十五元、餘自百元至百五十元、較上年還降低四十元、中莊開八九十元、低貨七十元至五十元、花香開二十四元、俱較舊减低七折、各行除英商略有進胃、俄商及其他莊、殊鮮成交、雖上月中旬後、英行得鄱湖沉沒巨量祁茶消息、進意趨濃、市盤抬漲五六元、品質最優者、復提升至百八十元、但此市價、僅屬十件至四十件之少數貢品、計其成本、還是大虧、卽普通頭茶血本、亦須一百匕八十元、如此最高價格、尙受虧負、其他自可想而知、預料本年祁茶結果、商戶整個之損失當不在往歲之下矣、（六月八日）</p>

<p>運動大會　發表宣言</p>
<p>本市第十四屆衛生運動宣言云、擁有三百萬居民的東方大都會上海市、它有最現代的建筑物、最前綫的交通工具、然而這小都會裏居民的生活方式怎樣、他們的健康怎樣我們如果檢討市民的日常或享樂生活、我們不難發現他們在最不規則的不衛生的習慣中、度着麻醉或頹廢的享樂生活、不分日夜的狂賭跳舞、以至於徵妓宿娼、使他們精神萎頓、體質贏弱、另一而復有許多爲生活而掙扎的市民、在最不衛生的環境或工作中度生、同時我們絕對不能否認我國民衆對於衛生太忽略了、至少是太不注意了、他們幾乎都有傅統的不衛生的惡習慣、我們統計每年人民的疾病和死亡、全國單單爲肺癆而死的有一百六十萬人、這眞是一個可驚的數字、每禁　開、外洋首先帶到我國的禮物是鴉片、接着海洛因、紅丸、整千整萬的送進我國、於是我們整千整萬的民衆墮落了麻醉了、在本市毒物瀰　更是駭人的廣大、無數的市民都給這慢性肖殺的毒物纏住着、他天一天向墳幕裏走云、因此這次十四屆衛生運動的舉行、應該說是含着最重大的意義、我們的注意點、分個人衛生和公共衛生二種、同時對於戒毒的官傳、更是特別注重、（一）個人衛生、大家　定記得「强健的精神寓於强健的體格、」這句話、尤其是在這年頭、社會經濟極度的衰落、個人如果沒有健康的體格、决不能克服這樣艱難的環境、因此個人的衛生、實在應該竭力注意、竭力講求、對於戕害身體的不良習慣、宜從速革除、一切預防科學的方法、應絕對信任、我們要自己保護自己的健康、自己養成良好的衛生習慣、（二）公共衛生、沒有公共衛生、就沒個人衛生、其影響及於經濟民族、至深且鉅、但是我們的民族狠不幸的、是最沒有衛生道德的隨地吐痰、隨意傾倒垃圾、糞便毫無管理、蚊蠅隨地皆是、欲求根本的改良、非集合民衆的力量、絕對沒有成功希望、（三）戒毒宣傳、無用諄言的毒物危害我們康健、是非常危險的、我們沒有統計、可是們知道它直接間接毒死了不知多少人的性命、毒物普遍了全國、又深入了本市、我們如果不早時劃除毒物、將來難免給毒物殺盡了我們、這次衛生運動、對於戒毒宣傳、特別注意、實有重大的意義、衛生運動、己經有了十四届、但是這並不算多、或可說才肇其端、以後的歷史、將與人類文化水垂靡巳、　們每届舉辦衛生運動、決不是在重複、而是令牠遵循着自然的法則而不斷地演進、所以他不免有新的添加、而且不能不有新的添加、但是另一方面衛生運動、也决不是夕不相關的獨立的運動、而是一脈相承有其基本的聯擊、因此不免有相同的地方、而且不能不有相當的地方云、</p>

<p>歐亞航空公司成立以來、迄經　載、該公司總經理李景樅氏、爲求公衆明瞭國際航空事業之價値與意義起見、特假公司四週年之便、發表該公司四年來業務進行之槪况如下、</p>
<p>創立數經波折　歐亞航空公司、於民國、　十午草創設立、是年五月　十月一日、開始上海至滿洲里間之正式飛航、距今適爲四週年、若追溯創立之籌議、則係自民國十七年始、距今已六載有餘矣、自創立迄今、四年之中、滬滿綫因東北事變而故棄於前、滬新綫又因新疆政變、致新疆境內一段暫停於後、於是歐亞間國際航空交通之功用、暫難實現、顧歐亞航牢公司、其</p>
<p>事業主要目的　爲何、即歐亞兩洲由最便捷之空中交通之完成是也、在已往言歐亞間之水上交通、如僅因地爲利、繞好望角而航行、此不足稱便、必利用科學之演、有蘇彝十運河之　闢而後稱便、時至今日而言、歐亞間之空中交通、如僅循人文集之區、曠時義日、繞道飛行兩洲南岸、亦不足稱爲便捷、　必利用科學之演進、為必要之設　、習特殊之技能、使中亞細亞之高原可　飛渡、而後稱快也蘇彝士運河之開闢、已爲薩克遜民挨捷足先登、而運用以統治其東方火殖民地矣、今茲</p>
<p>空中交通問題　當前、吾中華民族對於歐亞間通過中亞細亞之直航　業、又豈可聽其再落人後、此歐亞航空公司之所以必須創立也、惟是吾國物質文明、尙落人後、　必專恃國內之技術組織、來相促成、則時不我與、少有蹉跎、又將爲他人佔取先著、况此事本爲國際事業、事實上須與人合作、此又歐亞航空公司所以必須於總理提倡之利用外資原則之下、准許德方參與之理由也、當</p>
<p>世界大戰結束　本人在歐洲目覩航空器被採用爲交通工其之可能、日益具體、即憧憧於歐亞間空中交通之創辦問題、民國十七年德國漢沙航空公司亦擬向我國商議此事、本人曾與其代表石密德君商洽於北平、因即　其進行建議於黨國政府、必得要領、否君旋即南來、本人奉命與之草訂合同、當時我方經考慮所時之</p>
<p>合同主要五點　（一）航綫以上海爲起點、應力謀通過中亞細亞、直航歐洲、但爲留伸縮餘地計復現定滬滿·滬蒙·滬新·三綫、而以滬新綫之完成（即通過中亞細亞最便捷之綫）爲最終目的、合辦事業之相織、應爲受中國　律支配之公司、（三）事業與合作精神、在互惠原則之下辦理、但中方股本應佔、分之二、公司之營理權即屬於按股本比例分配人數之董事會、（四）德方對於中方應予以充分之技術的資本之借予、因資本借予所發生之債務、不得影響及於股權、（五）在公司創立之初德德方雖得負責管即飛航技術事務、但同時應即開始在國內及德國訓練合格之中國人員、使之能逐漸勝任一部乃至全部之技術事務、</p>
<p>合同磋商進行　歷時一年有餘、中間發經斷　復續直至十九年九月、方始成議由交部檢與漢沙航空公司雙方簽定、我方所持之各點、經一一如願以償、公司於　十年　月草創成立、同年五月三十一日、即已在其淞滿綫內開始第一次歐亞間航空空件之載運矣、雖然、公司事業之最終目的、仍爲通過中亞細亞之滬新綫而非滬滿綫、不過當時旣因英·法·荷·諸國所計劃　歐洲直航遠東航　航綫尚未成就、而滬滿綫之經營、已能減短歐亞兩洲間郵件之遞到時間約四五日、又因其在技述上較易施設、可以速成、故即以之權作過渡、航綫也、迨</p>
<p>九一八事變生　東三省之通過、頓吿無　、而其時英·法·荷·三國所計劃之遠東杭綫、又已有一蹴即就之勢、公司　毅然放棄滬滿綫、而另圖開闢具最終目的之航綫、惟時公司技術組織之中心、係設於滬滿綫中點之北平、故擬即以北平爲起點、直飛新疆、以達俄邊、所有沿綫經過各地、係預定為百靈廟·弱水河·迪化·以及塔城、　比重也方、　屬大山巨漠嚴　艁暑之區、有無飛行通過之可能、當時未能進說、但因公司事業之存亡、有如下鈞擊於一髪、自不可不以孤注　擲、</p>
<p>作冒險之試航　於　僅與以一月至之期間、　中途　　之各種接　物料、一一予以輸齊、本人乃於　十年　月偕德機師陸慈、五北平作首次之試航、結果竟僅歷十八小時安然到迪化、自是公司事業之半機回復、從業同仕、咸額　相慶矣、此次之試航、技術上雖已成功、椅經濟上為之考量、則猶未也、故最後仍决定以上海為起　俾可經停首都·行都·陪都·及甘肅省會之蘭州·曁西北孔道之酒泉·哈密　達通化、此種地方、不僅供應之輸運較便、而營運之　量亦必較多、至於航程、由北平至通化　十八小時、歷航二日、而由上海至通化、及用較速之飛機、亦不過歷航　日而已於是公司遂决定</p>
<p>改營豫陜甘新　之與西北有密切　係之滬新航綫、經過　年餘之慘淡經營、滬新綫種種設備與供應之組織、均已完善鞏固、目亦曾正式通航至三個月之久、目前由蘭州至迪化、段、雖暫吿停航、然一俟新疆政局　行轉善、即可恢復、至最近二年來、呈經交通部核准添辦之蘭包·平粵·諸綫、不僅將來國際通航時爲吸收各地航郵之所必需、且在此滬新綫未即復航之際、尤可資爲暫時之補助、公司之　存、旣無間題、則將來之展望自無限量、旣公司有實質上、</p>

<p>— 芥子</p>
<p>桃花江是美人窠，這一闋　曲，流行於海上多時了，可是這條以産美人著稱的桃花江，空間在什麽地方呢？我有一位湖南朋友梁君，他告訴我這條江是在湖南的益陽。</p>
<p>益陽是洞庭湘濱的要地，資水流域的茶，米，竹木，皆由此而轉輸出省，故地方異常繁富。益陽西南有座潙山，桃花江便發源於此，蜿五十餘里，流入資水，山擁青螺，水漣碧玉，沿岸風景，至為清幽。在每年三月間，碧桃花發，兩岸如火如霞，片片落江上，把江水映成粉紅的顔色；靈氣所鍾，無怪乎沿江多産美麗女郎了。梁君說：「湘中有句俗諺：『長沙木屐湘潭傘，益陽女子過得揀」』。可見桃花江上的美人，是名不虛傳了。</p>
<p>每值風和日麗的天氣，桃花江上，便有無數的小艇，往來水面，那打漿的人兒，都是花枝招展：中流容興，時弄歌喉，每令遊人為之神往。桃花江，桃花江，真是人間的仙境啊。</p>

<p>是早晨，望平街上的人，短衣的人，和潮水一般的湧着，來！去！他們忙着，忙着。</p>
<p>他們之中有大報販，有小報販，有報販的老板娘，還有賣大餅油條的孩子，冒着帶寒的晨風，勉強撑起勞瘁的身子，和苦的臉，穿來，穿去，搶着報館汽車上擲下來的大捆報紙，嘴裏還呌囂着彷彿是饑飯者搶着麵包，爭着，片時間都捆捆的堆散在人行道上，於是分為小疊，再由小疊分成一帖帖的，有的搶着　向袋裏塞着，往肩背上一掛，向東，南，西，北，四散去，喊着：「申報，新聞報要　？時事新報來？」；有的向脚踏車上一紮，「叮零零」，飛也似的衝出了望平街。</p>

<p>家小，總勿要討格種鄉下女人，說來儂勿要見氣！儂雖　是個男人，勿及我一個女人自由。王小如向春先生這樣說。</p>
<p>春先生是一個多愁善感的文學家，所有著作，散見海上各報，在S鎮上，尤其社會上的紅人，今天遽然的聽到王小姐這種閒話，真是愧忿交併，直覺得心頭火辣辣地難受。</p>
<p>晚上睡在床上，靜悄悄的體味日間王小姐所說的話：鄉下女子果真不配做我的妻嗎？伊的臉龐尚堪差強人意，脚是太不成樣了！伊不懂理解，沒有熱烈的情緒對待丈夫，不識字，這是伊的缺點！春先生想到這裏，感覺到人生的樂趣，從此已消失殆盡！撲簌簌的兩行熱淚奪眶而出</p>
<p>伊在夢回中聽得丈夫的啜泣，疑在夢魘，春！春！的喚了兩聲。春先生的愁感又換了幕，伊雖然是個鄉下女子，撫育小兒是盡責的，用錢是儉省的，浪漫的行為是沒有的，倘若娶了一個都市女子，對丈夫要求這樣那樣，也夠痛苦了吧？丈夫是個窮措　，伊不能安貧，說不定還要離婚哩</p>
<p>王小姐的話是因了伊妨心太重，所以說出這樣富有刺激性的話。但是鄉下女子和都市小姐，真是各有各的好處呢。</p>

<p>譒譯的學問，現在的確是有進步了，像從前　咭唎·　囒西，……這種簡單的譯音，而且硬生生，添一個口字偏旁，來表明是譯音的字，是不會再有的了。在現代的雜文中，流行着許多譯音的字都非常地清新雋永，含義幽默！姑舉幾個最普遍的出　作個例子罷。譬如Fiance'e英文的意思是「未婚妻」，現有流行着　澤音，讀為「廢陽傘」。廢陽傘是徒具傘的名義，而不能遮太陽，不能遮雨的東西，未婚妻之為用，也就等於廢陽傘，這個譯音，是再準確沒有的了。Husband英文的意思是「丈夫」現在流行着的譯音，是「黑漆板凳」當然哪！摩登的妻子是把丈夫當作板凳坐在屁股底下玩弄的，坐到有覺得不合式的時候，可以一脚把他踢過去，另外再換一隻坐坐不過有點難乎其為黑漆板凳而已。Girl英文的意思是「少女」，現在流行着的譯音，讀為「狗兒」。拿狗兒比少女，未免　不於倫，有些褻瀆女性，但是你看見過摩登女子，或者外國女人牽着的那種White　Terrier的狗兒嗎？它多末美麗，多末柔和，多末俊俏啊！Long　Kiss英文的意思是長時間的深吻現在流行着的譯音，讀為「郎渴死」。這三個字，真是妙不可言，讀者自能於言外體會，用不着我再來詳細的解釋。</p>

<p>現在四嬸嬸已是長眠不醒的了。</p>
<p>說起四嬸嬸，還能想起：矮胖胖的一個，臉是黑漆漆地，額上頭髪稀稀朗朗三數莖，和四爺叔差不多。這是因為伊嫁給四爺叔已十五六年，生下了五位兒女，顯然的生産得太辛勞了！這便是敎養成績的特別標記，誰也不能加以否認？說起話來，聲若洪鍾，應該不是短命的，可是現在祇活得三十九歲！</p>
<p>當伊直挺挺的躺在棺蓋上時，旁人便七張八嘴議論着：二年月日前四爺叔還從醫科大學畢業不久，雖然掛着牌子，生意是寥寥無幾，所以家用開支，真是有數的幾個錢。記得有一年暑天，衛生局派四爺叔往北平協醫院實習，時期是要三個月啦，四爺叔是老鼠投胎的，儲無隔日之糧，到了北平，家計是無法支撑了，四嬸嬸托人一封封信寫去催索，四爺叔沒法，祇得向他的堂兄，按月借十五大元來應付，等到三個月實習期滿，四爺叔便派在局中工作，每月也有百二三十元薪水後來又受某公司聘為醫事顧問，兩處地方大約可月得二百番光景。至今還不過兩年吧！生活漸見充裕，大家以為四嬸嬸可以享福了，那知去年中秋後，忽得咯血症，來勢很利害，雖則自己丈夫是醫師，丈夫的朋友又都是醫師，而終於針藥無靈，大　四嬸嬸是一條苦命了！</p>
<p>大家都在談論着，無非哀憐伊福薄，不能享富貴，偕老白頭。可是四嬸嬸只是一聲不響！</p>

<p>還有一個奇觀，就是那些大宮殿的屋頂上的黃色琉璃瓦，因受了陽光的籠罩，便反射出一種眩目的金光來，往常從近處看是不會見到什麽奇景的，如今在船上，隔着湖面瞭望過去，竟像是半空中透起了一道金霞一般。</p>
<p>太后不是備着兩艘遊艇嗎？這一艘永遠給伊自己乘坐的就是所謂「御舟」，其餘那一般不妨就稱為「御舟的副號」：它的大小與式樣和御舟約略相同，只是沒有它華麗。而它的艙頂上的假瓦的顔色則是用的綠色，也是要使它和御舟有區別的意思。每次遊湖時，凡輪不到隨侍太后的女官，以及宮中地位較次的人，一起雞皮疙瘩讓它載着，緊隨於御舟之後，約離五六丈路拱衛着。它內部的佈置以及舟行的穩適是否都較次於御舟，我却不得而知，因為我是每次都在御舟上的，根本沒有搭乘過它。</p>
<p>除掉這一艘「御舟的副號」之外，還有四艘小型的遊艇，也是每次都得隨着太後下湖去的，兩艘在前，分着左右，遠遠地隨在御舟的後面，這是供給宮中那班樂隊乘坐的——這一班是細樂，並不是每次在舉行什麽禮節時所用的那一班可厭的粗樂。——他們一起約有二十人上下，分載在兩條小艇上。（三三九）</p>

<p>志前笑道，這個年頭，像閣下這樣熱心的人，社會上也可不少。若是缺少了這樣熱心人，社會上有好些事情不能辦了。有容被他這樣說了，更覺興奮，只管鼓吹着志前辦理。當日留下了心，就預備了一套言語等著北海來說。不想北海自那日起，竟是不曾到來補　　志前想着，或是地上泥土沒有乾，他不能來，且自等　。然而，連三日，北海依然未來，志前這就知道他是有心負氣，心裏很是惋惜。到了陝西以來，這是自己看着最為滿意的一個人。不想他竟為了一個泛泛之交的女子，把師生之誼，給抛棄了。這事要傳到朋友耳朶裏去了，　　自己連一個窮學生都容納不得，未免是一椿笑話。志前忖思着，心裏是極感到不自在，又不便通電話呌北海來，怕是青年人沉不住氣，會在電話裏頂起嘴來。而且最奇怪的，便是那位朱姑娘，在這兩天，也不曾露過面，下雨天自己那樣帮他的忙，他竟是不放在心上嗎？然而這也不便過問，問起來就有了嫌疑了。在第三日下午，當茶房進來泡茶，志前帶了那很不為意的樣子，向他笑道：你們的媒人，做成功了沒有？茶房先是愕然，隨後想起來，笑道：你先生說的是那朱家姑娘嗎？這倒是一件笑話。（二三九）</p>

<h3 id="c226">小品文與隨筆 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 欽文</p>
<p>照一般的說法，「隨筆」只是「小品文一的一種。隨筆以外，別的小品文，還有着什麽呢？最普通的是「雜感」和「雜談」。大概隨筆以叙述爲主體，雜感以議論爲主體，雜談是叙述議論並重的；隨筆重在抒情，雜感和雜談都是重在說理的。——但這是專就小品文的範圍所說的話，如同小說並論，就沒有這樣分別的必要了。</p>
<p>小說要啊「結構，雖然寫了成功以後，好像原是通常的事情，無非照樣寫了下來的樣子。其實「表現的小說，所採用的題材，很少是眞的事跡，十之八九由於虛構；這在作者是很費腦力的。從「捉住意境」到實行寫作，固然要先起「腹稿」，必須多方的考慮，不知道要經過幾次的修改才可以成就。</p>
<p>爲求「作意　致」，使得「單純化」，又要寫得「自然」，做小說，可比擺「七巧板」，「動就得百動，不能顧東失西；因此，從捉住竟境到寫就，總要經過不少的時日：有了意境以後，未必就有相當的方式可以表現；决定了方式以後，還得考查是否適合，有沒有抵觸的地方。</p>
<p>我自己的經歷：母做五千以上字的小說，捉得意境以後，總要特地到室外去散步幾回；有時故　到冷靜的地方去獨自走走，有時却故意到熱鬧的街上去跑跑，爲的是細細的體味，對於事實，設身處地的探素。字數在三萬以上的，往往經過了長途旅行才實行動筆。——雖然</p>
<p>不能够爲着創作特地去旅行，向衣食於漂泊的找，是不難利用自然的機會的。在海闊大空的月光下，在波濤洶湧的急流中；站在高山之上，或者悶在斗室之內，心境不同，感想各異。在非常的情境中，感覺會得非常銳敏，感情也就特別豐富；所以有些平時想不到的錯誤，在這種時候會得突然悟着；平時探素不到的優點，也會在這種時候忽然感覺着的。</p>
<p>由上昕說，可見小說要做得好，委實不容易，至少是很費時間的了。小品文可不這樣，一經想着，不妨馬上寫作起來。這並不是故意粗率，無須　構，不必呼應，原是可以任憑興感信筆寫去的；而且篇　短小，即使要前後相稱，寥寥數語，一目了然，也不難一氣呵成。</p>
<p>小品文有了感想就可以拿起筆來寫作，隨時可寫，隨地可寫；有了個把鐘頭的空閒可以寫一篇，有了三四個鐘頭，就可以寫兩三篇了；隨感隨寫，可謂隨意之極！這同小說比較起來，其實劇本也是這樣的，實在是隨　得很的了！——雜感本也有人呌做一隨感一，或稱「隨感錄」；雜談是也呌做「隨記」的；那末把　切小品文　呌做「隨筆」不也是很可以的了麽？</p>

<p>— 沈聖時</p>
<p>住在山上，應該很淸靜，然而這兒一點不淸靜，似乎喧鬧得太呌人討厭了。</p>
<p>原是山上的房舍不是我的別墅，消受山居淸福生活的，當然不是一個「爲生活而上山敎書」的販賣知的商人所能渴想到的。</p>
<p>日子滑過去眞快，有這感覺當然還算幸福，躺在山坡下生病的乞丐，日子在他眼底大概是怪艱澀得不容易拐過的。</p>
<p>住在山上，已是半年：從江南北來時，身上還壓着皮滿，圍着禦巾，然而一瞬眼間，隆冬盡了，江南的春天也在我夢寐的戀念中老了。</p>
<p>藏起了皮衣，棉袍，夾襖，身上是飄着輕薄薄的單衣，已是初夏，看山坡上遍植的榴樹，在炎陽下延燒成一片榴火。</p>
<p>我住着的那間小樓房窗下，有條街，住着一些破落戶，成天總有機會聽到那些破落戶人家吵嘴，或是打孩子的聲音，一個操揚州口音的大胖漢子，天天在我樓窗下對面的小門闥外擺着八字脚站在那里；天一熱就成天赤膊，一個身體肥胖得呌人實在討厭，尤其那個像一面大鼓似的大肚子，我始終疑心那麽大的肚子總有點什麽病吧！然而在他全不在意，他自己是不會討厭到一身生得太使他吃苦的浮肉的，我看見他天天現着自得的顏色站在小闥門口，我從沒見過他做渦任何工作，同時我也給他想，他要做事總嫌有不方便吧！這修身體已夠累得他要命。</p>
<p>離開山城之後，這大胖漢子將會永遠留在我記憶裏討厭的吧！他不做一點事，成天在我樓窗下跟熟悉的鄰人或是買東西的販子扯胡話，我實在討厭他重濁的聲音，一開口就像砍着一個大的竹筒似的。</p>
<p>山後，有兩所小學校，每天有小學生吵鬧着打這里經過。</p>
<p>淸早到太陽下山，總有好多乞丐哭呌着從樓窗下走過，也有是爬過的，沒手沒脚的則是用一段的身子滾過。</p>
<p>一片各樣的吵雜聲，成天從我窗口蕩過</p>
<p>山居的生活，一點不得輕鬆暢快的心　。</p>
<p>想在山上寫成幾篇文章，證一點平時想讀的書，全不得有安靜的心。</p>
<p>我不能爲自己解釋，幾乎我到過的地方全不能使我找到一點愜心意處。</p>
<p>我要離開這地方，暑假快到，讓我拍一下身上積了半年的山風裏的塵沙，揮一揮手，回江南去。</p>
<p>別矣！小小的山城！懷遠。</p>

<p>— 姚慕</p>
<p>—風塵小札之三—</p>
<p>朋友：</p>
<p>在黃昏初過，燈火燦然的當兒，我又跑到北京來了。說起北京，朋友，你還記得吧，戀人似的北京，是你介紹我跟她認識的，此後我在北京便一住四五年。在那裏我也曾捱過窮，吃過窩窩頭，緊張，掙扎，像亡命者那樣，但是，我半輩子皎舒適甜蜜的家庭生活，也是在北京過的。北京十一個遲暮的美人，往日的儀態萬方，依然隱現在　的眉峯笑渦間，在她的懷抱裏你忘記了她的老大憔悴，從她的體貼，感到她的莊嚴。離開了她，不山你不惓惓的懷念。</p>
<p>前年北游，我曾在北京盤桓了好幾天，似乎澴不盡興，這回旅行北京本在路綫之外，但我終於繞口，打算在北京住宿然後轉到天津去。出了車站，我跳上一輛點着兩盞明亮亮的燈的洋車，吩咐車夫拉到東長安街的所旅館去。車照着往常走慣的路綫，穿過那從天安門到前門石板夾道，掠過那黑越越的雄壯的前門城樓，奔向東交民巷去。夜裏的東交民巷，依舊冷淸淸的。雖然已是初夏的天氣晚風還是料峭如春夜，收拾得乾凈的項道和兩</p>
<p>的齊整的東方化的建築物越顯得那裏的幽寂。疏疏的街燈從街的中心高高的掛着，燈本不很亮，離燈稍遠的地方更是灰暗。凉風一陣一陣吹來，燈光搖曳着，夾道的愧樹沙沙地響，樹影在牆上和地上微微的擺動，我的洋車，車夫和我的影子把牆上的樹影一個一個的掠過。街上差不多沒有人行，只有兩三輛洋車疾馳過。巡捕無聊賴地在街口呆站着，高大，怪獸似的使館門前的兩個守衛托着槍往夾蹀　着，　　的和諧的履聲劃不破夜的沈寂。可是，陡然的回憶挾着恐怖湧上我的心頭，我記起，我走的不是供情侶晚　細語的林蔭道，而只是喋過勇十們的血的魔窟……</p>
<p>出了東交民巷，便是那廣闊而有高高的樹，鑲緣着的東畏安街，在朦朧的夜色裏，這條中國最美麗的街道越　得幽靜柔和。</p>
<p>我進的旅館，朋友，恰就是我第一回進京與你同住的　間。老茶房以熟落的笑臉伺候，我洗過臉之後，便走出旅館緩步向東安市塲走去。那才是九點鐘左右，王府井街上的行人已稀疏得很，有一部分舖子已抱了門，幾處新添的霓紅招牌，冷落地照射着。我一步一步踏着那從前，天差不多辛少走一回的細磚砌成的人行路，低徊於過去的回憶之中。從東安市塲的南門進去　望，擺賣水果雜貨的攤子似乎比從前稀疏一點。我穿過了滿擺書攤的丹桂商塲然後轉到市塲的正街去。書攤子的陳設和人物差不多和從前無異，可是，往日跟我打招呼的怪熟的面龐巳不認識我了。在正街的北頭，那擺着鮮明五色的水果和糖葫蘆的攤子，那堆着黃澄澄，油溜溜的五香鴿子，醬雞之類的玻璃罩子，依舊的有誘人的力量，但是這裏的顧客跟書攤的　樣的寥廖可數，連攤販的呌賣的銅鈴子也懶得響了，「爲甚麽那樣蕭修呢？」我不禁在想。</p>
<p>從市塲走出來，疏疏的下了幾點凉雨，街上的行人更加稀少了，眼前更是片幽冷。我忍着莫名的悵惘，急急的回到旅館。</p>
<p>旅館也是異樣的靜寂，假如沒有那些現代的陳設，我恐怕會感到是置身古代在窮僻的道上的客合中。在幽寂的噓拂之下，無數的奔來的憶念，撑起我的疲倦的雙眼，我想起那因困蹇而到舒適的幾年的京　生活，我想起相隔千里懸念着我的妻兒，我想起近在咫尺而這回不欲見面的京中舊友，我想起把北京介紹給我，在我的生命上刻着深痕的海外的你……未來的奔波，磨折，我縱然還沒有想到，但這些迥盪的漩渦已够使我很遲才入睡，做了好些幽奇譎變的夢，和一淸早醒來了</p>
<p>起床的時候離平津車開還有兩個冬鐘頭，我記起這時恰是牡丹的季節，中央公園倒可以</p>
<p>走，我便結了房賬，帶着我唯　的行李—一個小箱子，趁電車到公園去，打算從那裏出來便　直上車。對於北京，這樣子眷戀，你聽見了恐怕也會失笑吧？</p>
<p>從來今雨軒西去，以至水榭附近，一望盡是牡丹花圃，雪白，粉紅，淺絳，深紫，各種有各種的古典的名稱；但是經過連日狂風的摧毀，闌珊的時節竟過早的掩至，大部分花朶已離披褪色了。這時仍下着霏霏的細雨，更增一點憔悴。</p>
<p>花圃旁的高高的紫藤架，也正乖着纍纍的瓔珞，但是那顏色已不是鮮艷像紫羅蘭那樣深紫，而紫中帶點灰白黯淡了。假如北京眞是像個遲暮美人的話，我想，紫藤却是北京最恰當的象徵了。粉白色的藤蘿棚。</p>
<p>朱紅和草綠相映帶的曲曲迴廊，新凈如故，我循着迥廊走到茶館所在的一帶去。我想起，迥廊是我最喜歡走的地方，我的孩子除了在園裏的兒童運動塲打鞦韆之外，最喜歡在這廻廊的滑脫脫的地上溜冰那樣走着，朋友，有一回你小是還替他在這兒拍了一照嗎？找又記起，他們住在北京的時候，中央公園　消磨了我們一家子半天的光陰，現在呢，我只好一個人在這兒作一刻的徘徊了。然而「慰　聊勝無」，引這句話也可以自嘲自慰了。（完）</p>
<h3 id="c229">敲門磗的主人 <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— 宗戈</p>
<p>在六月五日的自由談上見到姚雪垠先生的「文學的別用」一文。「所謂別用者」，姚先生說：「就是餘文學當敲門磗」。這一現象正如姚先生所說是屢見不鮮的。但是「衆投機取巧所獲得的一點點便宜，也只能像朝露一般，决不會保持長久」的。這飛人是窮文學靑年。我想姚先生忽略了許多另外的人們；一些特殊有閑者；那些永遠餘文學當磚來敲門的人們！而且實際上姚先生所說的那些窮靑年倒有些是想以文學作終身的事業。</p>
<p>我們相信，用文學當敲門磚的不是窮靑年。比方姚先生所舉的例子吧，辦刋物，找名人題字，寫序，以及託朋友寫書評等，這都是用不到的。而且也不需要。</p>
<p>有些所謂作家，像某詞人，某詩人，等，家裏有的是錢，用不到去愁明天的生活」，而且有閑來自己開書店，辦刋物，出版書籍，用朋友的傳作序等，他們自己所需要的是聲望，這樣的如同以前官塲上的「捐官」之領反過　說，窮靑年呢，只能把終身獻給文學，豐富自己的生活，熟練自己的技巧，得到的雖然多半是被碰回來，他們也不怎樣灰心。這種一方面吃飯，一方面寫作的靑年人是沒有錢去辦刊物的——別人也不讓他們來辦　更交不上名流學生，哪裏去找人題（或盡）對面寫序呢？記得某人作了冊書，封面是盡家的手筆，題詞是名流的名言。但呌窮靑年辦得死嗎？</p>
<p>再說，有　名聲以後的騙女人，升官，發財、更是窮文學靑年絕緣的。</p>
<p>因爲　有些女人是不需要用集子，雜誌去騙而能够來的！作官嗎？只能當書記，當到死，發財？文學靑年似乎只有作航空獎券的夢！</p>
<p>當然我並不是在說沒有人　那里把文學不磗用，不過，這飛人是姚先生所未談到的那飛特殊有閒者們——因爲他們所需要的只是當磚用，只是敲開門，進書門以後，那地磚別管是跟朝露一樣地消滅了也吧，或被別的人借用了再去作官，騙女人也吧，仙們是不管的。只要他們已經有了女人玩，有了官作，那磚一保持永久與否是不成問題的。——最多是拿　作「紀念品」，或「贈××先生女士）！</p>
<p>文學靑年是應當以文學作些事業，是不會錯的吧？然而來用它作敲門磗的是少數的胃牌人幹的了，而不是眞正有志文學靑年幹的事。</p>

<p>— 德國施托謨著陳隱之譯</p>
<p>『你看，跳舞鞋子早就放在那裏了了！』弗里茨說，『難道波力嘉先生也是一個鞋匠麽？』</p>
<p>那個女人搖搖頭。『您是知道的，弗里茨，不幸他是，個萬能博十啊！明年春天他還要替你修圳鈍表哩！這隻鞋子楚他當作聖誕　禮物給小孩子製成的，現在就已做好了。』</p>
<p>『那麼，瑪加列特，我的母親還有一大箱好看的舊衣裳，你們可以拿來改製一下給娜麗穿；每一件至少足够給她做三件哩！』</p>
<p>老太婆笑了起來；但她又扮出正經的面孔『我不知道』，她說，『這也是不可以的；但如果市長夫人願意的話……』</p>
<p>此時，小姑娘又進來了，就在母親旁邊站着。她換過了一件白色小領圈，這是逃不過我的眼睛的；又覺得那雙帶啊紅紅珊瑚珠的耳環，也是我剛才沒有看見的。</p>
<p>『你的意思怎樣，娜麗？』弗甲茨說，當老太婆正在猶豫深思地考慮這件事情時候，『你愿意同我們跳舞去麽』？</p>
<p>她沒有回答；但她拿雙手抱着母親底頸項，在母親耳邊說了些話，同時她的面孔愈變愈紅了。</p>
<p>『弗里茨！』老太婆一面推開執拗的小姑娘，一面說，『您當初何不單獨　我商量，那時就北麽　情都沒有了。現在你們打動了小孩子底心；我就知道，她再不會讓我安靜的！』——</p>
<p>他們便這樣得到了勝利。『星期三晚上七點鐘啊』弗里茨吿別時還說了這一句；然後，母親和女兒就送　們出　門口來。——當　們走了一段路回轉頭來時，我們小女及還站在那裏，她還對我們點了幾次頭，然後　快地跑回屋子裏去。</p>

<p>星期二晚上跳舞功課就開始了。我那雙裝有鋼絲彈簧的　過了的鞋子和那件新衣服，是那時鞋匠和裁縫剛爲我趕製出來的；當我走進大堂裏去時候，大家都已聚集在那裏了。我的同　們在窗戶旁邊圍繞老跳舞師站着，跳舞師正聽隨他們意思拿指頭按動他的　琴。女舞伴們結成　隊臂挽着臂，　來　去。</p>

<h3 id="c231">在陳之歎 <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— 宸</p>
<p>以前我們有句話；「在家孝父母，出門敬師長」可見對敎師的尊重並不始自今日，然而按之實際，「粉筆生涯」的淸苦，「冷板凳」的難坐，早已形成積重難反的事實，尤以中小學敎員為甚。在我們紀念「敎師節」的前後，就不斷的顯露出這一情景。首先是浙江省立各校校長，相率於五月初赴省府請願，要求趕發積欠，薪金不打折扣。其次有江西省立一中敎員韓國棟，以執敎生活難以維持，轉謀他職，竟因此受刺激過深，在校舍內懸樑自盡。前不久，廣州市小學敎員以今年五月薪俸絲毫未發，致校內廚夫停止開飯，激起一次不小的索欠風潮。最近長沙敎育界，亦有要求發淸四月積欠，並免搭庫券之舉。</p>
<p>從這些事實中，說明「粉筆生涯」，本巳極苦，竟乎還要加上積欠數月，打折扣，搭庫券等明减暗削的榨取。這種甕餐不繼的敎員生活，欲求其安於敎育已不可能，更無用求其在自己事業上有所建樹。原因很簡單，再你具有怎樣苦幹硬幹蠻幹的精神，至低限度總得吃飯，不然就「幹」不起！</p>
<p>當廣州小學正鬧索薪風潮之時，有一位敎員曾云；「不圖數千年後，師法孔子誨人的先生們，亦如孔子之有在陳之歎。粉筆生涯，味同雞肋，食之無味，棄之可惜，一時無其他相當職業，鍥而不舍，則等於自磨，故以目前環境言，似入老人院，又似被判處無期徒刑。」我們許多想從「生聚敎訓」中以求複興民族的人士，今見這些負有重責的中小學敎員，他們的生活竟成為「入老人院」，「被判無期徒刑」，的情形，不知又將作若何感喟。</p>
<h3 id="c232">紀念冊 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 溟茫</p>
<p>無意問偶然把十年前中學時代友人們所書寫的紀念册翻開在眼前，於是過去像一陣輕烟般地突然從腦筋上浮上來。十年的時間固然過去得異常迅捷，而人事的變化更是出乎人的意料。一本紀念冊壓在箱子裏隨着牠的主人東西漂泊，長久以來已被拋棄於記憶的範圍之外，却不料在這次的另一番移徙，才像被埋藏的古物般被發掘出來。那册面上已經顯得有點灰舊，也蓋上了一層薄薄的塵灰，然而一頁頁翻下去，那內面光滑的頁子却還保留着一點新鮮。更令人會激起心情的微微騷動的，是少年時期友人們的相片竟還栩栩如生，而每個字蹟似乎還遺下了新鮮的墨跡，好似才在昨天寫成似的。</p>
<p>人，似乎總免不了是一種懷舊的動物。這小小的冊子的被攤開在眼前，少年時期甚至是童稚時期的可笑而可愛的生活，便被從深心中勾引出來。一種活潑而夫眞的面貌一個個地從這冊子上露現出來，接着便憶起了那些純潔而樸眞的友情。那種尙抱着童心的友輩是怎麽地率眞·坦白，無邪；像朝陽般的富有生氣，也像挺直着身子的永望着眼前。那些未被社會和人生塗上了灰色的污衣的人們是怎麼地勇敢，怎麼地具有深深的正義感。恁着直覺，他們比社會人更缺乏世情上的虛偽，雖然這些少年們却被老年人責駡為「野性的孩子」的。同樣她雖然他們不透澈於「人情世故」，但同時他們却比成年人來得正直無私。他們噪鬧，鬥口，甚至是打架，但他們噪鬧之後便太平無事，或者更來得更為親密。他們不會勾心鬥角，以組成社會的黑網；他們也不自私自利，害人以肥已。他們忘記了過去，遠望着將來。對世界·社會·國家·和自己·都懷着光明的熱望。沒有灰心，也不會感嘆；他們是組成這個世界的最為健全和有望的角色</p>
<p>然而十年過去了。這個純潔而美好的小小的集團却跟着各人年齡的長大和各自的社會關聯而分散，而破裂。為了生活，堅密的友情旣然被拆散；為了生活，潔白無疵的心情也都或多或少的塗上了灰點了。前些時各人的偉大的熱望是失掉了；社會削去了他們的個性，也消滅了他們的正義感。甚至老友都變成了仇敵，而且私也把人類向上的本性改變了。到現在，這班老友們有的固然變成了社會的　蟲，有的變成了大腹賈，惡紳士，或貪污的官吏，有的卻窮無立椎，把生命消磨在社會的巨輪之下。有的墮落得吸大烟，變成酒鬼；有的却把靈魂塗上黑炭，或把身體磨折至此。十年的人事變幻成這麼多的花樣，而過去的熱情只化成了一，陣雲烟。童年與童心旣失去了，而成長的生命却不曾代替上成長的理智，替社會國家盡一份人類應盡的力量。現在，這小小的册子還好好地被保留着，而那些臟小瑣碎的人物，却跌向什麽深淵，或什麼黑魔的洞窟裏去呢？</p>
<p>這似乎有點令人不易相信似的：一本小冊子，十年之問不過染上了些小的微塵，而人事却比紙頁變化得更加快速和更加複雜。如果把這小冊子保留再多十年·二十年·或一世·則將來這些人物又將變成什麽花樣，而令人更生起今昔之感來？人·果眞是這麼脆弱，這麼地不中用麽·這本紀念册，其作用果只在令人興感麼？那麼·我眞想把這本小冊子拋棄了！</p>

<p>— 凌秄錫</p>
<p>「苦了的是長根娘子一個，這種日子，哼！天天給磨折着，打駡着，不是人過的啊！哼，造孽的，造孽的唔！」</p>
<p>話是不錯的，長根娘子，自從男人死掉後，是天天在眼淚與磨折中過日子，尋死覓活給人家從小河裏救起來，也有過二三次了吧？</p>
<p>長根娘子還是去年春上一個遠房的叔子給長根做的媒，說是女的家裏連半個人都沒有了，祇有一個寡婦的姨母，連衣衫都是不周全的，還肯讓人躭擱在屋裏？所以，便趕緊要把女孩子給人了——不貧大盤禮，祇要人好，化上三五十塊洋鈿，也就成了。在長根想，這是一個「便宜貨」，所以就趁着上年田裏還有點收成，便把人娶了來了！</p>
<p>然而到夏裏，因爲年成乾，在毒太陽車了一夏的水，到秋天，便在一塲傷寒病裏伸一伸腿：死了！</p>
<p>從這時起，長根媽便說她命凶，把自己的「當家人」也尅掉了。於是就明一聲暗一聲地咒罵着；而長根的妹子么妹，則因爲嫂子家裏是精光的，怕會吃了她家用了她家，又佔分了她家的僅有的十七畝稻田；所以，在輕視與排遣的目的中，也借了「命凶尅死了人」的口實，一天天地，會娘，把已經做了寡婦的長根娘子磨折起來了。</p>
<p>就這樣，小姑子是尖利的，中間夾着的長根媽可也是個「尖嘴貨」；便這樣一天天地，妯娌間最先開起了一條欺凌的，陰毒的，謀取的鴻溝；而跟着在婆媳中間的惡化也一天天地加深了。要磨折一個失去了生活的重心的脆弱的靈魂是容易的。每天每天，當惡毒的話從小姑子與婆的嘴裏箭一般地射出來的時候，長根娘子總在哭泣中默默地想：「在這不適宜於生活的生活中過下去，自己是終會毀掉這個生命的。」　　終於，有一個早上，人人們發現長根娘子的身體巳經浮在後河的水面上，跟着波流在漂動了。</p>
<h3 id="c234">累 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— 西蒙</p>
<p>假如家室是等於一個男子的繚架，那自己亦如若干人一樣，把那鐐架用自己的手來套在自己頸脖上，而使自己於無形中消去了一切的自由，甚至年靑人應有的進取的雄心。現在我只爲目前一堆糟粕似的生活所疲倦，對於過去再引不起一種悠閒的情思加以溫習，對於未來也不敢去推想，要是有少許希望存在、則這希望簡直是寫在水上，寫在渺茫的人夢裏一樣，因爲兩個孩子和一個女的什麼家已經拖累得我幾乎運日子也打發不了了。</p>
<p>家眞是要不得的癢疣啊！我時時這樣感覺着。使我發生這感覺是有日常的習慣情形圍困着的。</p>
<p>自己是個靠文字產生過活的人，每天總須要騰出一些時間伏在寫字檯上，在紙上作寫。當溫存了一點靜適的思緒打算開始工作時，正才坐到桌子前邊，筆還沒抓上來，兩個孩子便吵將起來，大的一個把小弟弟嘴巴上一塊糖搶過去，冲出門跑掉了，於是小弟弟嗚呀的哭嚷着：</p>
<p>「媽媽，阿哥搶我的糖，糖」。一邊說，一邊眼淚連鼻涕塗滿一臉，等到母親追上去，捉回來搶東西的一個，可是糖早就給吞下肚子裏去了，自然得被　兩三下的處罰。另一個見着他的哥哥給打巴掌，好像感到滿足，馬上不哭了。然而哄過了這個又哄不過那個，被打的一個已巴巴的哭着。而這一哭一時便不易止住，似乎非等到他心中的委屈盡情哭乾凈不停，於是惹起母親更加忿怒了</p>
<p>「你哭什麽，死你去的，輕輕打一下便這樣閙，你再哭就再打你一頓」。可是孩子在這時是不顧到大人們的威嚴的，瞧着母親沒好話頭，反而兇兇的咒駡，便越發傷心的哭下去，於是母親果眞把這個不聽話的潑皮孩子揪住，重重地打一遭兒，然而只管打並不能收服孩子的野性。</p>
<p>—你別儘這樣打吧，對孩子們要用好話說的。</p>
<p>我實在看的不能忍住了。這紛擾的塲面我還想做得了事，我遷怒到妻子處置不得體，弄的一宗小事閙個不可開交。而同時妻子亦將火氣轉向我這邊來了：</p>
<p>—你就祇知道掙扯漂亮話，你爲什麽儘坐着瞧，不起來騙騙他們。孩子又不是我一個的。</p>
<p>—笑話，你又要無端尋上我身上來吵嘴，你成天幹的什麽勾當，述孩子都無法管敎，也等着我動手不成，那我事亦不必做了，給你管孩子，可以的，但是吃喝誰去呢？</p>
<p>妻似乎有些明白她自己言動的無理，低下首悄悄地走向火灶間去。不過一下子我的悲憤就沒法壓制，想着如此粗惡的生活簡直不是人過的。索性跑出來，到外面解解悶，在這種時候我往往想發狠不再回家，扔棄了他們，寗可一個人四處流浪，省得領受這無謂的苦痛，然而轉念間，又捨不得，以爲人到底總是擺脫不了這糾纏，人到底總是要這樣可憐的生活下去的。</p>
<p>常常便是起始由小孩子吵開端，到最後却是我們兩個的賭氣和鬥嘴做結果。漸漸地我不只對於妻，同時對於孩子，都一樣憎恨起來。可是我無論如何不能離開他們，拋集他們，因爲這呌做家，而且還必得永遠合他們共同生活者，因爲這呌做他們是我的妻子，我應該供給他們的一切。而又聽憑他們賜與種種的煩惱或紛擾，因爲這鐐架，這累，原是用自己的手來套在自已的頸脖，我將怨艾誰，還不是活該的。</p>

<p>— 雋</p>
<p>都市沒有夜，都市是不夜的城，夜的黑色的神威永遠施展不到這裏，永遠被金色的電氣的世界所代替着。年紅燈光亮的色彩到處閃爍，無邊際的瀰漫了整個都市的空間，你站到那最繁雜的街上，强烈的燈花燒得那一角完全變成通紅，而那燈花又像輕烟，隨着風飄，一會兒忽然凝聚，濃霧一般的蒙蔽了眼外的景物，一會兒忽又散開去，於是一條埋在兩旁儘是摩天的高層洋房的成爲深巷似的的街，一直向前伸展着，汽車就在深巷似的街上飛奔，用着彷彿探海燈的前燈刺射得使人眼睛發暈。</p>
<p>全紅一色的團集的印象，會呌你經不住太複雜的刺激，而有着神經衰弱之感。</p>
<p>不够麼，還有的是振盪於你聽覺系上，好像海浪在沸騰着的電車聲，載重卡車聲，騷亂的人聲，歌弦聲，以及那時髦商店的無綫電，播音機在傳播着黃昏特別節目的迷人的流行歌曲。</p>
<p>而反映到你的視覺機能上的，便是可以呌眼花撩亂的車馬的流水，人物的流水，來往看的活動交織映畫，像電影那麽一幕幕閃過去，溜過去。</p>
<p>你還會有絲微夜的念頭，存在於腦裏麽。</p>
<p>你一邊在邁着小步子，一邊也許已悠悠然做着各種奇異的玫瑰花色的夢，而魔慾悄悄地在細微血管裏活躍着，這並非是不可能的事的，因爲巡行在週遭的，全是些誘惑的物質因子，偶然一個幻覺，一個不留神，儘可把那掛在半空上的霓紅燈，看做婦人的媚眼，這幻覺是最容易發生的，其實打從你身傍橫過去，擦過來的不已就都是一些俘着一臉笑動兒和滿身射噴着淸芬的香味的輕軟有機身體！</p>
<p>於是你可以做着白日裏决不會做的各樣惡劣的事，在夜的都會，在是光明也是黑暗的任何一隅。</p>
<p>而當你一步一步走向那一層一層朝天爬上去的，發乎望不見尖端的摩天高層樓，像巨靈的蹲踞在街角間，你或者不自覺停一停脚，聽聽上邊含有陶醉味的爵士樂一串串掠紫蓮色的窗格蜿　地漾蕩出來，溶化到已是闌夜的佈着蕩霧的凝靜的夜空中，却又滯留到你的心房，而心原是脆弱的，像讓什麽怪異的東西猛的衝了下來。</p>
<p>把你夢亦似的一衝衝上去了。不過現在正是夜，待天明還遼遠的。</p>

<p>— 施瑛</p>
<p>市鎭的夏晚，是並不怎樣寂寞的。店舖雖然都上了店板，可是明亮的燈光，還從半掩的門裏悄悄地流出來，在暗黑的市河面上閃動。橫跨市河的圜橋上，坐滿了各色納凉的人，披着襟，享受初夏水面的南風。茶樓裏自然生意更好，彷彿一天的疲勞，都消溶有遲緩的談話和淡黃的茶水裏。那個孩子，照例地拖着懶散的脚步，拉着手中的胡琴，在黑暗的街頭，慢慢地走過釆了。尖銳的弦音，在平靜的空氣中波動，令每個消閑的人　意着。大家知道又是那個孩子。在汽油燈白熱的光輝下，映着他瘦瘠的身影，枯黃的臉龐，小手指曳弄着手中的舊胡琴。—那孩子還不彀十三四歲呢，他是一個沒有親人沒有家庭的流浪兒，誰也不曾知道他的姓名和籍貫。從上個月，他像一片落葉一樣，給飄到這市鎭上來，每晚總在街頭和茶樓賣唱，靠了幾支下流的小調，他塡飽了自己的肚子，白天却溜在市梢的關帝廟裏打磕睡。</p>
<p>他仰起枯黃的臉，以疲倦無力的眼光，望着那些望着他的茶客，手中的弦聲緩緩地停了，等待茶客們的分付。於是「孟姜女」，「烟花女子吿陰狀」，「十杯酒」，這些小調從茶客的嘴裏說出來。茶樓裏的談話聲，漸漸地低下去，就是在國橋上納凉的人，也以他們的耳目，注意到茶樓這邊來。燈光明顯地映着這渺小的孩子。哀怨啜泣似的胡琴聲，粗厲地領抖了幾下，接着，孩子的歌聲，也尖銳地發川了：「正月裏來是新春，家家戶戶點紅燈……」那聲音雖然尖銳響亮，可是夾着沙音，像嘆息一樣地波動着，跟一支鐵輪，在水泥的地面上擦過一般每個茶客給他的聲音吸住了。然後，他應着抑揚的胡琴聲，又唱「烟花女子吿陰狀」，他的身體，跟着弦聲歌聲擺動着，彷彿模仿着淫猥的姿勢。這更博得茶客的歡心。茶客們幾乎忘了一切，陶醉於這個孩子了。</p>

<p>當歌聲弦聲停止時，那孩子彷彿突然僵木了。他枯黃的臉上，泛起潮紅的顏色，眼光裏閃着乞求的波痕。他瘦小的身體，在茶客間移動着，接受作明天生活的銅子，茶客們又起伏着嘈雜的談話聲，還飄着若有若無的嘆息。那孩子收完了銅子，又拉起粗厲的胡琴，曳着遲緩的脚步，離開燈火輝煌的茶樓，渺小的身影，在黑暗中慢慢地消逝了，弦聲也隱約地失去了。河面仍舊拂過初夏的南風……季節還是蓊葧的四月呢，然而在孩子的前面，是暗黑的路。</p>

<p>常愛飄上粵東的故鄉那秀潔幽閒的農村裏怡然自樂的姿態；而像做着美夢似的。就在這樣的心情下歸去。但却像闖進了另一個怕人的境界，只有匆促的幾天，我又住不得了家鄉的，懷着難堪的創傷，重復來開始我流浪的旅程。</p>

<p>抵潮州城，從大街經過，前面的四進士亭出現着，記起從前自家行裏最常呌的那轎舖，是開在這亭的左邊，便下車想順便喊頂轎子，快點到家去。還以爲踏進轎舖，定可聽到熟識的打着好笑的潮陽腔歡呌：「五少爺」的聲音。然而定眼細尋，舖子也不見。幸好聽旁舖人說：「老早關門了」！才十分驚疑的向自家的行裏去。大白天，門竟是掩着，推進去，冷冷靜靜，述呌了幾聲還沒人出來，黯然的轉個灣，見到荒亂的正廳，和已鎖住的庫房，後廳才慢慢走出一個衰頹的老人，駭住的張着口「唔唔……這是住在行裏四十多年的老夥計振叔，他像掉淚似的哭訴着。</p>
<p>「你還在做夢？你家暹羅的生意去年關門了。這裏是今年正月倒的。你想想，我十幾年積下的薪水都存在行裏，你想，我幾十年來辛辛苦苦，…我要不要老命？你回去吿訴你哥，這裏述飯錢也沒有，敎我怎麽守件這空房子？你還想坐轎子？轎夫早已回老家了！又有汽車到石坑了呀？短命汽車！石坑到家這一段，常有匪，有錢人都逃出來，不敢回去了！你還敢坐轎去尋匪嗎」？我聽他長長的說了一大篇，我的呼吸快斷了，呆了好久才又急問他，挑祖子的苦力呢？他更胃火了，「見鬼，有貨車了呀？就是沒貨車，鬼有束西給他們挑？回來的番客沒有了，有錢人不回去了。………」</p>
<p>我好像掉在五里霧中，昏昏糊糊的搭車到了石坑，隻身爬上早年常走的舊山嶺回家去。打算在家裏消夏，但周圍的聲色，迫得我窒息了，那可怕的謠言，風聲鶴淚的，夜間的騷亂和槍聲，都在催我快點離開。於是，便又在難堪的塲合下給垂淚的母親送走了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">After Japan's New Demands, Hebei Situation Worsens; Foreign Observers Find New Demands Difficult to Accept; Panic in Tianjin and Beijing, with Migration Already Occurring; Japanese Aircraft Reconnoiter Chinese Troop Movements <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Beijing) Japanese military authorities have once again made astonishing new demands, causing the situation in North China to suddenly deteriorate. The Japanese side made these new demands because four "special agents" of the Kwantung Army were detained on June 5 in Zhangjiakou while traveling by car without passports by soldiers under Song Zheyuan. Although they were released the next day, Kwantung Army officials were greatly angered and viewed this as a sign of strong anti-Japanese sentiment in Chahar. According to foreign observers here, if these demands are accepted, most of North China will become, in effect, a province under Japanese control. The Beiping Political Council would be abolished, and the Beiping Military Council would also cease to exist. North China would then be managed by minor officials under Japanese guidance. These new demands have caused even greater anxiety among knowledgeable Chinese than the demands of May 29. A senior official here told a Reuters reporter that He [Yingqin] will return to Beiping in a few days, but they are very pessimistic about the situation. This is perhaps the most serious crisis China has faced since the Japanese troops invaded Shanghai in early 1932. Chinese dignitaries met yesterday until late at night to find ways to deal with this new situation. According to foreign sources here, the Japanese side attached a warning when making the latest demands, saying that China should not expect foreign aid. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Although the surface here seems very calm, in reality, people from all walks of life, both Chinese and foreign, are extremely anxious. Although there are no signs of military preparations anywhere, Japanese destroyers have placed three small field guns on the riverbank in the Japanese concession, and some areas are equipped with barbed wire. Although Japanese consulate officials deny that the situation is deteriorating, Chinese and foreign business communities are uneasy. The content of the new demands is not yet known, but panic is gradually rising in the banking sector. According to reports from Japanese here, fourteen Japanese aircraft flew over Tianjin and Beijing today to monitor the movements of Yu Xuezhong's troops. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 13th, the Italian concession authorities in Tianjin had prepared measures to protect the safety of the concession, and several Italian officers inspected the power grid. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Japanese military authorities are now adopting the means of threatening residents of Beiping in 1933, taking aerial demonstrations. The Japanese side has informed the Chinese authorities that twelve to seventeen aircraft will depart from Rehe and arrive today or tomorrow to monitor the movement of Chinese troops withdrawing from Beiping. However, Japanese aircraft have not yet arrived today, and are expected to arrive tomorrow, coinciding with the presentation of credentials by the first Japanese ambassador to China, Akira Ariyoshi. Residents of Beiping are still flocking to other places, and the cars heading south are extremely crowded. According to reliable sources from the Chinese side, hundreds of Japanese soldiers arrived at Gubeikou from Rehe yesterday. A portion of them have reached Nantianmen, conscripting local militias and forcibly ordering them to act as porters. Another unconfirmed report states that since Monday, twelve Japanese military trains and one armored train have passed through Shanhaiguan and entered the non-combat zone. If military action occurs in Beijing and Tianjin, the position of various consulates and their guards is particularly worrying. The total number of troops stationed by the great powers in North China is as follows: one large British battalion stationed in various locations in Beijing and Tianjin; 1,500 French troops; a certain number of Italian troops in both Beijing and Tianjin; 800 American troops stationed in Tianjin and 500 in Beijing. The focus of general attention is now on Nanjing. It is expected that He Yingqin will arrive in Nanjing tonight to discuss the latest developments with government leaders. The Japanese side is currently trying to conceal the seriousness of the situation, but does not deny its demands. Qin Deshe went to see Japanese military officer Takahashi today to discuss the Zhangjiakou incident. It is widely believed that representatives from both the Kwantung Army and Song Zheyuan will soon begin negotiations to resolve the matter. According to Qin's report, the four detained individuals did not have passports. According to treaties, all foreigners traveling in Chahar Province must be subject to questioning. An official of the Beiping Military Council told Reuters today that he did not know that the Japanese had warned against China seeking help from Europe and the United States, but he believed that such a warning may have been issued in Nanjing. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Tonight, Takahashi, the deputy military attache stationed in Beijing, visited Bao Wenbo, He's agent. The issues discussed were not disclosed. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Beijing) He Yingqin has concluded the Hebei diplomatic issue and must personally report the progress of the negotiations to the central government and indicate future countermeasures. At two o'clock in the morning, he left Beiping for Beijing with a small number of staff, including Secretary-General Xie Zhongyuan, Telegraph Secretary Zheng, and Adjutant Wang Guozhong, to meet with the central authorities and report everything. Before his departure, He convened a meeting of all members of the Military Council at Jurentang, delegating the routine duties of the Military Council to Bao Wenbo, the director of the Office, to handle on his behalf. Less important matters would be discussed and handled in consultation with various members. Important matters could be telegraphed directly to the central government for instructions. He's trip will take about a week before he can return to the north. All departments and groups of the Military Council will continue to work as usual. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Beijing) He Yingqin, chairman of the Military Council, went to Beijing by special train at 3:20 a.m. on the 13th to report to the central government on the resolution of the Hebei incident, accompanied by Secretary-General Xie Zhongyuan, Adjutant Wang Guozhong, and a small number of guards. The Military Council's official duties will be handled on his behalf by Bao Wenbo, director of the Office. (Central News Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Beijing) He took a car to Beijing on the morning of the 13th to request instructions on the future problems of Hebei Province. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Beijing) After He went to Beijing, Yuan Liang was responsible for maintaining the security of the city. Wan Fulin and Wang Shuchang, members of the Military Council and commanders of the Beiping and Tianjin garrison, visited Yuan Liang this morning to discuss the security of Beiping. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Political Conference held an interim meeting on the morning of the 13th. After Wang [Jingwei] briefly reported on the Hebei issue, the meeting adjourned. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) He Yingqin left Beiping at 3:00 a.m. on the 12th by special train to the south. He will inspect the troop movements along the way. If He only makes brief inspections along the way, he can arrive in Beijing around 8:00 a.m. on the 14th. (Central News Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Beijing) The slogans of the provincial and municipal party headquarters were washed away by the municipal authorities on the 12th to improve the city's appearance. (Special dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Beijing) The Japanese troops who were scheduled to replace the garrisons in Tianjin and Beijing along the Yu, Shan, and Beining lines gathered in Shanhaiguan on the 10th. On the 11th, a train was sent from the Tangshan factory of the Railway Bureau with locomotives such as the 306157 and carriages to Shanhaiguan for use. It is now learned that due to some reason, the Japanese garrison in Tianjin and Beijing will not be replaced for the time being. On the morning of the 12th, a unit of about 500 Japanese soldiers, carrying several heavy guns, returned to Jinzhou, and the 306 locomotive was also ordered to return to Tangshan. All the Japanese troops who arrived at Shanhaiguan have also received orders to return. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Beijing) The Japanese warships on the sea off Qinhuangdao and Shanhaiguan have all raised their fires and are standing by. It is heard that they will return to Lushun. In addition, airplanes fly around various places in eastern Australia every day recently. On the 12th, another airplane came from the northeast and circled around Tangshan for about half an hour before flying west. (Special dispatch, 13th) (Beijing) The Kwantung Army Headquarters in Japan recently sent a certain senior official to Shanhaiguan for inspection on the 14th. Japanese officials and overseas Chinese are preparing to welcome him. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Beijing) In order to reconnoiter the withdrawal of our 25th Division, 2nd Division, and 51st Army units, the Japanese officially notified us the other day that Japanese aircraft would fly to Beiping today. The Japanese side then changed its plan and decided to send two teams of aircraft, totaling 30 aircraft, designated as an "aircraft sightseeing group," to fly from Chengde and Shanhaiguan. They were originally scheduled to arrive in Beiping today, but due to cloudy and foggy weather, the aircraft team turned back. It is heard that they will come again tomorrow, coinciding with the presentation of credentials by the first Japanese ambassador to China, Ariyoshi. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Beijing) The second batch of replacement troops for the Japanese North China Garrison Army are scheduled to arrive in Tianjin and Beijing within one or two days to carry out the replacement of garrisons. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A light reconnaissance aircraft No. 23 flew from Jin County on the 13th, carrying two Japanese officers, and landed at the Dongjuzi airfield in Tianjin. The two officers were taken to Haiguang Temple by Japanese military vehicles. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Beijing) A telegram from Tianjin states that a Japanese military aircraft flew from outside the pass this morning and landed at the Dongjuzi Airport. After a short stay, it flew towards the Beining line. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Three Japanese aircraft flew from Jinzhou to Tianjin on the 12th. One of them flew back on the same day, and the other two flew to the southern section of the Beining line and the northern section of the Jinpu line at 5:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. on the 13th, reconnoitering the southward movement of the 51st Army. They returned to Tianjin in the afternoon and landed at Dongjuzi. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 13th, more than 200 Japanese soldiers from Gubeikou opened up areas around Nantianmen and Xiadian, and sent people to Niu Lanshan in Shunyi County to requisition 20 civilian boats, and invited the county heads of Miyun, Huairou, and Shunyi to consult. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Major General Umezu, commander of the Japanese Tianjin Garrison, took the Pingyu express train to Qinhuangdao at 1:35 p.m. on the 13th to inspect the new troops arriving from the country. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yesterday, another 700 Japanese soldiers arrived here from Tanggu, and another team is expected to arrive at Qinhuangdao tomorrow. Still another team will arrive at Tanggu on Saturday. The total number of Japanese troops in Hebei Province will reach 4,000. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>

<p>(Washington) The U.S. government remains silent and has not made any statement regarding the current situation in Hebei. However, the authorities are now closely watching the developments there and are quite fearful. Deputy Secretary of State Phillips still adheres to Hull's attitude of observation and does not want to make any comments or criticisms on the issue at present. (Reuters dispatch, 11th) (New York) Foreign trade circles here expressed the opinion that the open door in North China has been closed due to the expansion of Japanese influence, leaving only a crack. However, the U.S.'s historical position of upholding the open door has never generated any particularly significant commercial benefits. Therefore, people in general are not very alarmed by this situation and feel that any involvement in this fiercely competitive situation in the Far East is a questionable price for existing business. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Officialdom has not yet spoken about the U.S. attitude toward the Sino-Japanese situation, but it is expected here that the U.S. embassy in China will move to Nanjing to avoid the need to station troops in Beiping. It is heard that, according to the Boxer Protocol, the U.S. infantry regiment stationed in Tianjin to protect American overseas Chinese will also automatically move outside the new area under Japanese influence to avoid Japan asking them to withdraw. It is also heard that the troops of other countries stationed in Tianjin and Beijing will also follow this practice. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) All newspapers today published the latest developments in North China in large headlines. However, Reuters carefully inquired and learned that various well-informed circles are dealing with the overall situation with composure. They acknowledge that they must wait for further details. Well-informed circles are now paying double attention to the mission of Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, the British government's economic advisor, to China. Tokyo's statement that Japan does not want to participate in the international financial conference to be held in Nanjing in September is seen here as superfluous, as Britain has never proposed holding this meeting and is unlikely to do so in the future.

<p>(London) Financial circles in the British capital consider Sir Frederick Leith-Ross's upcoming trip to China as having great significance. It is generally believed that the British Industrial Survey Mission conducted investigations in Manchuria last year and achieved considerable gains. Now, British railway expert General Hammond and two other commissioners are in China investigating railway issues. Sir Frederick Leith-Ross's trip to China will supplement the gains of the above two projects. Generally speaking, after Mr. Ross arrives in China, he will study the situation of Chinese railways from two perspectives: (1) China still owes approximately £41,300,000 in principal on British loans for Chinese railways, and the accumulated interest has reached £40,000,000; (2) Developing China's railway network, in this regard, Britain should provide China with additional loans, but British industry can also benefit from this. In addition to this, Sir Frederick Leith-Ross's most important mission in China is to address monetary issues. Since the implementation of the United States' silver policy, large quantities of silver have flowed out of China, causing the Chinese currency to be in a difficult situation. China is a very large market for Lancashire cotton textiles. If the unstable monetary situation continues unchanged for a long time, the market may gradually disappear. Therefore, it is necessary to find practical ways to remedy China's monetary problem. Once the monetary situation improves, the status of British holders of Chinese domestic industry securities will also improve accordingly. Therefore, the British government is now striving to restore China's prosperity in order to benefit both China and Britain. (12th Havas Telegram)</p>

After investigation by local officials, they stated that the reason for sailing into the port was not sufficiently justified, and ordered the ships to be taken to this location for trial.

<p>Seoul. Minister of War Hayashi and his entourage, who had been inspecting the eastern provinces, arrived here at 2:01 PM today from northern Korea. Korean Governor-General Ugaki, Korean Army Commander Ueta and others welcomed them at the station. It is reported that Hayashi is scheduled to leave here at 3:00 PM tomorrow and return east, arriving in Tokyo at 3:25 PM on the afternoon of the 16th. (Hua Lian News Agency, 13th)</p>
<p>Seoul. Minister of War Hayashi arrived here at 2:15 PM this afternoon and spoke as follows: I advocate for the stationing of four divisions in Korea, or at least three divisions. The Ministry of Finance believes that the financial resources required by the military should be borne by external regions, but the current situation in external regions may make it difficult to bear the costs of national defense. (Dentsu, 13th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) As a result of Minister of War Hayashi's inspection of Manchuria and meetings with the commander of the Kwantung Army, it seems to have been confirmed that the Manchurian Incident expenditure should be increased and absolutely cannot be reduced. Furthermore, in the general budget, in addition to 200 million for the second material and facility development expenses, there are new requests for Seoul and other items, making it impossible to reduce the budget. On the other hand, the financial authorities' policy is to promote fiscal soundness and adopt a gradual debt reduction policy, leading to early controversy centered on the national defense budget. After Minister of War Hayashi returns to Tokyo, he plans to meet with Finance Minister Takahashi and is determined to obtain the necessary minimum. As a result, it will be unavoidable to issue more public bonds. (Dentsu, 13th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) As the outline for determining the next year's budget is being formulated, the military argues that the international situation remains tense and unchanged. Therefore, based on the view that the incident has not been resolved, military spending cannot be reduced. However, the financial authorities and part of the government believe that the expansion of military spending is at the expense of rural development measures. But the military does not agree and intends to rigorously examine the arguments gradually emerging within the Cabinet deliberations and the government that military spending is excessive. The results will be reported to the government by Minister of War Hayashi upon his return to Tokyo as a reference for determining the outline of next year's budget. The arguments put forward by the military are as follows: 1. The expansion of military spending in recent years is based on the compelling international situation and is a common phenomenon in countries around the world. It is a legitimate and unavoidable enhancement of national defense based on pure self-defense. 2. Another important reason is the Manchurian Incident expenditure. Judging from the current state of "Manchukuo" and the overall situation in East Asia, this expenditure cannot be reduced either. Given these two fundamental reasons, and the fact that the military strength of other countries far exceeds that of Japan, Japan must also seek appropriate improvement and enhancement.

<h3 id="e72">Ambassador Arima Arrives <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— A Note</p>
<p>The new Japanese Ambassador to China, Akira Ariyoshi, arrives in our country during this bleak autumn of the Hebei situation, and is scheduled to present his credentials today. It is said that he bears the important mission of "promoting Sino-Japanese cooperation to lay the foundation for East Asian peace." This statement is certainly welcome to us. However, upon reflection, there are things that one feels compelled to say. Taking the opportunity of the Ambassador's arrival, I offer a few humble words.</p>
<p>China and Japan are both located in East Asia, separated by water. In terms of history, race, culture, and economics, there is a need for mutual cooperation. Among the major East Asian powers, China and Japan stand out. They hold the key to East Asian politics and represent the spirit of Eastern civilization. Therefore, laying the foundation for East Asian peace depends precisely on China and Japan. Given such a deep relationship between China and Japan, they should treat each other sincerely and respect each other's sovereignty and interests in a spirit of equality and mutual benefit. However, the historical facts show that this has not been the case. Isn't this strange? We believe that the fundamental reason is Japan's past mistaken view of China as a target for aggression. Therefore, if we want to promote Sino-Japanese cooperation today and make the relationship between the two countries increasingly friendly, it depends on a change of heart on the part of Japan. What we hope from Japan is that it abandon its pretense and establish sincerity, eliminate its past aggressive views and the existing facts of aggression, and treat China with equal respect and mutual benefit. This will allow our entire nation to dispel the suspicion it harbors towards Japan. This is a prerequisite for promoting relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>According to historical facts, the estrangement of feelings between China and Japan has generally occurred after the fact of aggression had already been established. However, looking at the recent statements from various sectors in Japan, they are all focusing on eliminating "anti-Japanese education" and "boycotts of Japanese goods" in China as the core of their policy. In reality, there is no so-called anti-Japanese education in China at all, and there has been no overt boycott of Japanese goods in recent years. As for commemorating national humiliation, advocating national goods, and promoting national self-reliance, these are actions that any independent country should take. Even if some points cause Japan to feel somewhat displeased, they are a reaction to Japan's past actions. If Japan examines the causes and effects of these issues from the perspective of national independence, it should be able to put its concerns to rest and realize that its past policies toward China were misguided.</p>
<p>The above two points are the central issues in Sino-Japanese cooperation. The key to their resolution lies entirely in the hands of Japan. The saying "He who tied the bell must untie it" is a profound statement of the truth for eliminating the estrangement of feelings between China and Japan. We have great hope for the upgrading of the diplomatic missions of China and Japan to the ambassadorial level. Ambassadors have a higher status and greater power than ministers. They are also more convenient in international diplomatic activities. Japan's dualistic diplomacy towards China may change after the two countries exchange ambassadors. Moreover, this move clearly shows Japan's initial intention to treat us as equals. From now on, the relations between the two countries may improve. Furthermore, Japanese Ambassador Ariyoshi has been stationed in China for nearly two years. He has a deep understanding of our national conditions and a more accurate grasp of the facts. It is hoped that he will meet with our people with a sincere attitude, seek the development of the national interests of both countries in a spirit of equality and mutual benefit, and at the same time further work to eliminate the established facts of aggression, so that lasting peace in East Asia can be established. If so, the benefits will not only be enjoyed by China and Japan alone.</p>

<p>(London) It is expected that France will submit reservations on certain points of the compromise reached between the French Du Yude Naval Delegation and the British government. It is reported that the basis of this compromise is that the tonnage requested by Germany, equal to 35% of the British naval power, should be distributed among all types of warships, and Germany should not increase it at will. It is reported that if the other signatories of the Treaty of Versailles have no objections to this proposal, Britain will accept it. Italy will support it, and France seems to also agree in principle, but will submit reservations on certain points. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) The British government recently informed the United States, France, and Japan about the progress of the Anglo-German naval talks. This morning, Japanese Ambassador to Britain Matsudaira delivered the reply from his government to the British Foreign Office, expressing no opposition to Germany's request for a total naval tonnage of 35% of the British navy. However, it stated that although the Japanese government does not oppose Germany's request, it cannot be considered that Japan supports the method of stipulating naval ratios among countries. In addition, US Ambassador to Britain Bingham has also delivered a reply to the British government, and it is reported that the United States also expressed support for Germany's request. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>(Washington) In response to the British government's communication regarding the Anglo-German naval talks, the US government expressed its sincere hope that the Anglo-German talks could lead to a common understanding among European naval powers and establish mutually acceptable fleet standards. The US government also hopes that this matter can promote a general agreement among the world's naval powers to continue reducing naval armaments in accordance with the principles of the Washington and London Treaties. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>The US Does Not Want To Intervene in European Affairs</p>
<p>(London) It is reported that US Embassy Counselor Ashton visited Foreign Office Undersecretary Craig today, stating that the United States wishes to obtain all information that Britain can provide regarding the ongoing Anglo-German naval talks, and that the US attitude has already been clearly stated in the Washington and London Naval Treaties. It is understood that the United States is currently phrasing its statements very cautiously, which is an expression of President Roosevelt's determination not to intervene in European affairs. It is believed here that Britain will allow Germany's request to build a navy up to 35% of the size of the British navy, but Britain still insists that there should be restrictions on the classes of warships in the German navy. Recently, various countries in the world have gradually realized that the naval clauses of the Treaty of Versailles do need to be revised. US Undersecretary of State Phelps said that the United States hopes that the Anglo-German talks can gradually bring the opinions of European countries into alignment. Phelps said that if the Anglo-German talks are successful, it will greatly contribute to a general agreement among the world's major naval powers to reduce naval armaments in accordance with the principles of the Washington Treaty. (National News, 12th)</p>
<p>Maintain the Current Ratio With Japan</p>
<p>(Washington) Regarding the Anglo-German naval negotiations, the US State Department recently issued a statement, stating that the United States is willing to maintain the 5:3 ratio with Japan. However, if Japan moderately increases small warships, and the tonnage is less than four-fifths of the tonnage of US small warships, then the United States can also tolerate it. The United States is deeply concerned that European countries will not be able to reach a naval agreement. If European naval agreements cannot be reached, it will inevitably lead to an increase in naval forces, and as a result, Japan will have a justification for justifying its expansion of its navy, which is of particular concern to the United States. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>Germany's Naval Expansion Plan</p>
<p>(London) The naval affairs editor of the *Daily Telegraph*, Bellwardle, commented on Germany's naval construction plan, saying that "it is still unknown what kind of warships Germany has decided to build." It is reported that the plan determined by the country consists of the following: (1) five 22,000-ton battleships with guns ranging from 11 inches to 12 inches in diameter; (2) six 8,160-ton heavy cruisers equipped with 8-inch guns; (3) thirty 6,000-ton cruisers; (4) ninety 800-ton submarines; (5) two 22,000-ton aircraft carriers, totaling 454,190 tons. Once this fleet is completed, the style will be new and the speed of navigation will be high, which the British fleet cannot match." (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) According to British naval expert Bellwardle in the *Daily Telegraph*, Germany's naval construction plan includes building five 20,000-ton battleships, with gun diameters from 11 inches, six 8,160-ton large cruisers, with gun diameters of 8 inches, in addition to thirty-six 1,000-ton destroyers, nineteen 800-ton submarines, and two 22,000-ton aircraft carriers.

<h3 id="e93">Record of Hu Hanmin's Departure <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Mr. Hu Hanmin, who has been in Hong Kong for a long time, has been away from the political stage for quite some time since going south. Although he occasionally expresses his opinions on the current situation in Hong Kong, he only contributes opinions on Southwest political affairs and has never set foot in Guangzhou. Therefore, both the northern and southern political circles attach great importance to Hu's remarks. The news of Hu's departure abroad has been widely spread for a long time. However, he suffered from high blood pressure, which caused him to suspend his trip. In March, after a doctor's examination, his blood pressure has recently dropped back to 170 degrees, and his health has slightly improved. Therefore, he decided to go abroad for recuperation and take a breath of fresh air, which is the reason for Hu's departure this time. After Hu decided on the date of departure, the Southwest political circles went to Hong Kong one after another to meet Hu and discuss the current situation and ask for instructions on future plans. Those who arrived in Hong Kong first included Zou Lu, member of the Southwest Political Affairs Committee and President of Zhongshan University, Chen Zhongfu, member of the Central Committee, and Chen Rong, Secretary-General of the Political Affairs Committee. On the 8th, those who visited Hu included Li Zongren, Commander-in-Chief of the Gui Army and member of the Southwest Political Affairs Committee, Lin Yizhong, Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Guangdong Province, Qu Fangpu, Director of the Finance Department, Liu Jiwen, Mayor of Guangzhou, Yang Xiji, Director of the Audit Office of the Political Affairs Committee, Li Luchao, member of the Provincial Government, Zhang Renmin, Chief of Staff of the Gui Army, Tan Huiquan of the Provincial Party Committee, and Lu Sizeng, President of Dongqin University. The officials visited Hu in turn and asked for instructions on everything. Therefore, since the 7th, Hu's residence in Hong Kong has been crowded with visitors. Hu either had intimate talks with comrades or just socialized briefly. After Hu's residence packed up, he first transported his luggage to the Italian郵船"Conte Verde" on the evening of the 8th. On the afternoon of the 9th, at 4:00 PM, Mr. Hu, together with his wife and daughter Mulan, as well as attendants Cheng Tiangu (former Mayor of Guangzhou), doctor Chen Yiping, secretary Shi Yangchong, female secretary Zhong Huizhong, and attendants Huang Lianzhong and Liang Xingling, a group of nine people, boarded the Italian郵船"Conte Verde" by ferry from Hong Kong. Li Zongren, Lin Yizhong, Zou Lu, Liu Jiwen, Li Jishen, Qu Fangpu, Chen Jiayou, Yang Xiji, and Tan Huiquan all personally sent them off to the Italian郵船. When Hu was about to leave, he did not talk about political diplomacy to the outside world, only saying that his own views would not change due to the transfer of time and place. Hu was wearing a white long coat and glasses on the ship. Those who served him were his daughter Mulan and Ms. Zhong Huizhong. Hu talked with the send-offs for a while, then took a photo with Li Zongren, Zou Lu, Lin Yizhong, Qu Fangpu, Gan Jiehou, Liu Jiwen, Hu Mulan, Hu's wife, and Zhong Huizhong. The send-offs then bid farewell. After Hu was also tired, he went to rest in the P-class cabin of the ship. After everyone dispersed, Jiang Guangnai, Jiang Tingkai, Tan Qixiu, and Shen Guanghan also rushed to see him off, and talked with Hu for about three minutes before shaking hands and leaving. It was already 5:00 PM. With a whistle, the ship had already set sail, and the military and political circles of Guangzhou who came to see him off returned to the province by evening train. It is said that Hu's departure this time will first go to Italy, then to Switzerland, to stay for recuperation temporarily, and the date of return is undecided. Chen Shiyi, a poet from Fujian, visited Hu before he left Hong Kong and had a close exchange with Hu. Before leaving, Hu wrote a poem entitled "Again in the Rhyme of the Old Poet Shi Yi to Bid Farewell to Comrades," which says: "Luo Xi has a saying about a strange man, not disappointed that this old man knows when parting, the country is in distress and can be regarded as Jin and Song, the poem is foolish and inconvenient to go to Chai Can, those who follow me are in agreement with the Tao, and there are still people who calculate it to the south, and try to take my child for thousands of miles, and ten years of old things are worth deep talks."

<h3 id="e94">Southwest Civil Aviation Expands Equipment, Meteorological Station Established in Zhaoqing <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Southwest Civil Aviation has recently expanded its equipment in various stations in Guangdong and Guangxi. Starting from Shipai in Guangzhou, wireless stations have been set up in Wuzhou, Nanning, Longzhou, Maoming, Qiongzhou, and Beihai. Recently, all stations have been uniformly retrofitted with both long-wave and short-wave transceivers for use in case of weather changes. Moreover, long-distance flights between Guangdong and Guangxi cannot ensure safety without weather reports. Therefore, a meteorological station has been established in Zhaoqing, the central station between Guangdong and Guangxi, to report on the weather. The establishment of this station has made civil aviation aircraft traveling to and from Guangdong and Guangxi more convenient. As a result, important figures from Guangdong and Guangxi travel between the two provinces by civil aviation aircraft. On the first of this month, Gui Army Chief of Staff Ye Qi was ordered to come to Guangdong to meet Li Zongren and Chen Jitang of the Guangdong military authorities. The civil aviation aircraft that Ye took arrived safely in the provincial capital on the afternoon of the 1st. On the 2nd, he went to Mapenggang in Dongshan to visit Li Zongren, reported on the military affairs of Guangxi Province, and described in detail the situation of the troops stationed on the border between Guangxi and Guizhou, as well as the situation after the communist bandits on the border between Guizhou fled to Sichuan. He then visited Chen Jitang, and Chen asked about the situation on the border of Guizhou. Ye and Chen also had matters to discuss. They returned to discuss in detail several times in the past few days. Chen hosted a banquet for Ye. The guests and hosts had a very pleasant conversation. On the morning of the 5th, Ye accompanied Li Zongren to Meihuacun to visit Chen Jitang and discussed various military affairs in detail again. A satisfactory solution was reached at 11:00 AM. It is reported that Ye's mission in Guangdong has been completed, and he left Guangdong on the 6th to return to Guangxi to report.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Current Situation of Qimen Tea Production and Sales: This Year's Sales Price Plummets, Severely Impacting Farmers and Businesses <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Correspondence from Poyuan: Qimen, with its limited land and mountainous terrain, boasts special local products. Aside from porcelain clay, tea is the most significant product. Its superior quality has long held a leading position in the global market. The livelihood of farmers largely depends on it. Therefore, the prosperity or decline of the tea market determines the economic well-being of the Qimen rural areas. In the past five years, the global consumption of Qihong (Qimen red tea) in various countries has suffered from economic hardship. Preference has been given to cheaper options, coupled with the dumping of Indian and Javanese black tea at low prices. The sales price of Qimen tea has plummeted. The losses suffered by tea merchants are especially pronounced this past year. Although the output of new tea this year is reported to be poor, tea firms have tried hard to improve their processing methods. However, the sales and market performance of the first two batches of boxed tea shipped to Shanghai not only remain sluggish, but are even worse than before. Tea merchants are frowning, feeling that they have exhausted all means of recovery. The misfortune seems to be intensifying. For example, more than 4,000 boxes of tea from 22 tea firms were lost when they sank in Poyang Lake last month, resulting in losses of over 400,000 yuan. Tea merchants have barely caught their breath, and are already facing another heavy blow. The old losses and new wounds are truly overwhelming. Whether the market can turn towards a smooth path in the future is currently difficult to predict. The following is a detailed investigation of the current situation of Qimen tea production and sales this year:</p>
<p>Reduced Production Volume: In previous years, the production volume of Qimen tea was approximately over 30,000 dan, yielding about 60,000 boxes of dried tea (excluding what is collected by Fuliang). According to statistics from the Anhui Construction Department in 1930, the output was 22,005 dan, yielding over 40,000 boxes of dried tea. Last year's tax statistics also showed 38,500 boxes. This year's production volume, up to the end of the spring tea harvest (excluding Zi tea), is estimated by various firms to be only over 26,000 boxes. After deducting the 4,000 boxes that sank in Poyang Lake last month, the total is no more than 22,000 boxes. This is a significant difference compared to the production volume of previous years. Even compared to last year's output, it is a reduction of over 16,000 boxes. The reasons for this reduction are: (1) Farmers, seeing the recent oversupply of tea, leading to a supply exceeding demand and low market prices, with sales prices not covering costs, have not paid attention to tea tree cultivation, allowing them to become mostly barren, leading to a reduction in production volume. (2) Last year's severe drought in summer and autumn, and the lack of snow in winter, caused the tea gardens to dry up. The tea roots did not receive rain nourishment for a long time, resulting in weak growth. (3) The production volume of Zi tea (i.e., summer tea) accounts for approximately two-tenths of the spring tea. This year's spring tea sales price was weak, and no farmers harvested or processed it. Tea firms also stopped purchasing it. Due to the above three reasons, the production volume of Qimen tea this year is even more reduced.</p>
<p>Tea Firms Tightening Up: In the past, Qimen tea's prosperity was due to the large sales volume in Europe and America, with market prices rising year by year. The number of tea estates and processing factories also increased accordingly. In 1930, there were over 90 tea firms in the entire county. In 1931, it increased to 114. In 1932, it increased further to 182. Last year, the number decreased by over 20. This year, there are a total of 137 firms opening for business (including over 20 cooperatives), which is over 30 fewer than before. The reason for this reduction is that the original tea firms have suffered years of losses, and their capital is exhausted, making it difficult to start a business. Even the firms that resumed business this year have mostly tightened up their operations and strived to reduce costs to avoid further losses. This approach seems to be unanimous among the firms. However, in reality, the situation is quite different. When new tea comes onto the market, the competitive spirit of a few firms is always difficult to eliminate. Some are lukewarm, others are enthusiastic; some suppress, others raise prices. The mountain price is still difficult to standardize, leading to an increase in costs. In addition, this year, many firms have a poor harvest, forming a situation where demand exceeds supply. In previous years, each firm's number of boxes was mostly over 200 to 300 boxes. This year, the average firm only has 100 to 200 boxes. Only a few dozen firms have 200 boxes. Although the number of boxes has decreased, the firm's expenses cannot be reduced accordingly. Each firm spends between 2,000 and 3,000 yuan. In addition, there are more than 2 yuan in taxes per box (this year is several times higher than last year), 5 to 6 yuan in shipping costs, and Shanghai warehouse rent, insurance, and commissions. In total, the cost of the first batch of boxed tea is approximately between 170 and 180 yuan per dan. The cost has increased invisibly. The tea firms' initial intention to tighten up operations, reduce costs, and avoid losses has now become uncertain.</p>
<p>Farmers' Suffering: Qimen farmers, who cultivate rice for their own consumption, do not have enough food. Their annual income from local products, except for the mining of porcelain clay for sale in Jingdezhen, all depend on the abundant tea harvest and good prices to alleviate their impoverished lives. In the prosperous years of Qihong, the tea prices earned by mountain farmers were higher than those in Wuyuan, Xiuning, and Shexian. This is because Wuyuan and Xiuning green tea is dried once and sold, with the highest price per dan being only 70 to 80 yuan. Qimen tea is not dried once. The core contains moisture, forming semi-dried tea buds, which are sold to tea firms. The highest price per 100 jin can reach 120 to 130 yuan, which is only half the weight of dried green tea. If two are combined into one, the price is also doubled. This only refers to the total income from the sale of tea leaves by Qimen mountain farmers. Calculating the labor and food costs for tea picking, the actual income is not substantial. This is because most Qimen tea farmers do not pick the tea themselves. They need to hire outside workers for picking and processing. Even if we calculate the average price of rough black tea at approximately 20 yuan per dan this year, it is only enough to cover the cost of labor. The income earned by the producers is very meager. Also, if we calculate the county's production volume of 25,000 dan this year, the tea farmers' income is only 750,000 yuan. After deducting half for labor costs, only 375,000 yuan flows into the mountain farmers of the entire county. The income of the entire rural area is limited. A drop in the bucket is of no help to the parched land. Although the Pingli Tea Improvement Center and the National Economic Commission have sent personnel to guide the organization of tea transportation and sales cooperatives to alleviate the suffering of farmers, each village is limited to a few households. Members are farmers who own tea production. All equipment is trained and instructed by the technicians from the center and the Economic Commission. Funds are borrowed from the Shanghai Bank. The authorities are sincerely trying to help, and the methods are not without merit. However, there are still a few unscrupulous individuals who manipulate or falsely organize cooperatives, secretly using their old tricks to exploit tea farmers. Therefore, before the cooperatives have a solid organization and significant results for the individual benefits of tea farmers, it is difficult for tea farmers to obtain practical benefits and universal coverage.</p>
<p>Financial Insufficiency: The prosperity of Qimen tea firms in the past was due to high overseas sales prices and the availability of ample credit. Seven or eight years ago, Shanghai tea firms, in order to compete for a larger share of the boxed tea, were mostly lenient and generous in lending money to customers. Each year, the tea firms lent tea money to tea firms, often reaching around 2 million yuan. In recent years, due to poor overseas sales, tea firms have accumulated losses, and the losses suffered by the firms have been substantial. After discussions among the firms, new regulations were formulated to prevent further losses. After mutual compliance and implementation, the firms' loans to tea firms have been mostly tightened. Therefore, in recent years, most tea firms have felt that their own capital is weak, and it is not easy to obtain loans from firms. It is difficult to dance with short sleeves. They all suffer from the exhaustion of all resources. Last year, although the Four Provinces Farmers Bank sent personnel to Qimen to provide loans, the total amount lent in one month was only over 20,000 yuan, which was very meager. It still could not help to promote financial flexibility. This year, due to the Silver and Money Industry Bureau's tight control over lending, the sources of funds for each tea firm are increasingly scarce. The total amount of loans lent by each firm in Qimen this year is only over 800,000 yuan (the maximum loan amount per firm is 6,000 yuan, and the minimum is 3,000 yuan). Adding the tea firms' own capital of 30 to 40 percent, the total is only over 1.2 to 1.3 million yuan. This is only enough to circulate the huge amount of Qimen tea production of 50 to 60 thousand boxes. How can this be sufficient? Speaking of development is even more difficult.</p>
<p>Sluggish Sales Prices: Production and consumption are both indispensable. If there is production without a market, then there will be excessive expansion. The decline of Qimen tea today is due to the lack of smooth channels and the increasingly low market prices. If the market is small and the market price is high, operators can still benefit. If the market price is flat and does not hurt the capital, tea merchants can still support it. However, in recent years, both sales volume and market price have been declining. Even if tea firms have abundant capital, they cannot withstand repeated losses. Qimen tea is suffering from the pressure of sales prices. Everyone is exhausted and sinking into a deep abyss, unable to save themselves. Last year, tea merchants eagerly hoped that the overseas market would improve and slightly compensate for previous losses. However, when the new tea came onto the market, the sales market remained stagnant. In total, over 15,000 boxes of tea from Qimen and Fuliang were shipped to Shanghai last month. The top-grade Qigong was only priced at 165 yuan, and the rest ranged from 100 to 150 yuan, which was 40 yuan lower than last year. The Zhongzhuang was priced at 80 to 90 yuan, and the low-grade goods were priced at 70 to 50 yuan. The Huaxiang was priced at 24 yuan, which was 70% lower than before. Except for a slight intake from British firms, there were few transactions from Russian firms and other merchants. Although after the middle of last month, British firms received news of a large amount of Qimen tea sinking in Poyang Lake, their willingness to buy increased, and the market price rose by 5 to 6 yuan. The highest quality was raised back to 180 yuan. However, this market price only applied to a small number of tribute goods, ranging from 10 to 40 pieces. Calculating the cost, there was still a large loss. Even the principal of ordinary first tea costs 170 to 180 yuan. If the highest price is still losing money, others can be imagined. It is expected that the final result of Qimen tea this year is that the overall losses of merchants will not be lower than in previous years. (June 8)</p>
<h3 id="e97">Suzhou: Active Capture and Elimination of Locust Plague in the Four Rural Areas <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The various rural areas of Suzhou have suffered from severe drought since entering summer, and are now showing signs of disaster. In the western rural area of Hengjing, a locust plague has broken out. The Wu County Magistrate has personally gone to the rural areas, along with the Party Headquarters Agricultural Department and other institutions, to direct the villagers to capture and eliminate the locusts. In recent days, over 1,000 jin have been captured. It was found that in the fields of Zhuang and other places in the rural area, only nymphs were initially found. In just five or six days, they developed into flying locusts. At the same time, in Niuyanjing and other places in the territory of Wujiang, locusts gathered on the ground, piling up more than a foot high. The villagers drove them to capture them. They covered the sky and the sun, and flocked to the Hengjing rural area of Suzhou, causing more to be captured between, and the more they captured, the more there were, and they could not win. In the towns of Yuexi and Nanku in Wujiang, a large number of locusts also flew into the territory of Suzhou, in groups of tens of millions, and have now spread to Xukou outside Xumen, and Guoxiang Chefang outside Fengmen. The city party once transferred a fire pump truck to the countryside to remove the locusts by spraying water, but the effect was not great. Although the locust catching bag made by the Agricultural School is extremely applicable, there are too many locusts, and it is too slow. Wujiang has also begun to contact Wu County to capture them together. Hengjing Jin District Chief Qian has already held a meeting to decide to change to large fishing nets, which will be spread on the fields at dawn. After an hour, the locusts will fly into the net, and then quickly collect them. In this way, dozens of pounds can be obtained in one net. They are capturing day and night, and are limited to cleaning up within three days. As soon as the drought appeared, the locust plague became a reality. Although the capture work is currently extremely tense, whether it can be completely captured and eliminated is still a question.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Wuxi: Three Industries Negotiate Grain Insurance <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>There are a total of twenty-seven grain storage and industry stores in Wuxi, which specialize in storing grain and other goods, and also operate mortgage businesses. The warehouse receipts issued are of excellent credit. Because the storage is safe and reliable, insurance has not been handled in the past, and there have been very few water and fire accidents. Recently, the storage industry has been considering handling insurance for the sake of consolidating business safety, and has negotiated with the Rice and Bean Bank and the two industries once. However, there are many types of grains and persimmons, and the amount of storage varies, which is different from the insurance of other goods, so it is difficult to have specific measures for a while. Later, the banking industry telegraphed and agreed with Shanghai China, Taiping, Anping, Baofeng, Taishan, Fengsheng, and other six insurance companies that are related to the industry to send representatives Dong Hanxi and Xiang Yuwu and other five people to Wuxi the day before yesterday to invite representatives from the storage, bank, and two industries to exchange opinions at the Bankers Association. After the negotiation, the following four principles were determined: (1) Each storage warehouse will insure the type of grain stored with the insurance company, assuming an integer, and the company will issue a policy as proof. (2) The insurance premium will be calculated by each warehouse sending a form with the actual amount insured on a daily basis to the insurance company for daily calculation. (3) In the event of an accident, the insurance will be paid according to the amount reported by the warehouse in the form. (4) In the future, each insurance company will set up a joint office in Wuxi in order to contact each other in case of an accident.</p>

<p>Zhang Yipeng, a member of the Jiangsu Provincial Donation and Tax Supervision Committee, previously came to Changzhou to investigate harsh and minor taxes. It is now learned that Commissioner Zhang has drafted an investigation form and submitted it to the committee for discussion and approval. The items listed in the investigation form that should be abolished are: the meat shop cold meat tax, amounting to 2,200 yuan; the education miscellaneous tax, amounting to 1,698 yuan; and the public security miscellaneous tax, amounting to 300 yuan. The education miscellaneous tax and the public security miscellaneous tax have already been automatically deleted in the newly compiled budget for the 24th year, and there is no problem of resistance. The offset after the meat shop cold meat tax is abolished is subsidized by the Department of Finance in the amount of 40% of the stamp duty allocated by the Ministry. There are a total of nine kinds that are retained, such as damage, house police tax (merged into house tax), and public welfare tax. All have been automatically abolished. The remaining house tax, car tax, banquet tax, hotel tax, swimming tax, and advertising tax are six kinds that are still permitted by common practice and are considered to be temporarily retained.</p>

<p>In recent years, the economy has declined, and all industries have withered. Therefore, the number of stores that have closed down is everywhere. The recession of commerce can be seen from this. Therefore, those who maintain the stores now are trying their best to save expenses. Now, the shops in the southeast gate area should have the necessity of reducing the rent due to the decline in business in recent years. Therefore, some of the shopkeepers have united to form a tenant union, demanding that the landlords reduce the rent by 30%. They are now in the process of contacting and signing, and will officially hold a meeting in the near future to decide on the implementation plan.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1930, Qidong was harassed by bandits, and the people were restless. The villagers organized a self-defense corps to capture and kill several bandit leaders, and the bandit situation gradually subsided. However, recently, Yang Hankui, the township chief of Zhongqing Township in a certain district, colluded with the family members of the dead bandits and fabricated lies to the provincial and county governments to accuse the self-defense personnel who handled the matter that year, intending to extort money. When the people of each district learned of this, they were all indignant. They jointly presented the case to the Nantong District Commissioner's Office, which sent personnel to investigate and found that it was true. Yesterday, the county government was secretly ordered to send the police to arrest Yang. After questioning by Zhou Cheng, the secret member of the trial, Yang was ordered to be detained.</p>

<p>When He Bukun, the former director of the Agricultural Extension Institute, handed over his duties on August 1 last year, the number of seedlings in the county nursery was found to be inconsistent with the number after the successor's detailed count. The Ministry of Construction checked and found that 210,000 seedlings were missing, worth more than 10,000 yuan, and ordered He Bukun to compensate. He suspected that the people's hearts were treacherous. He did not check in detail for a while, and was deceived. He sued the county government. The Ministry of Construction believed that the matter involved responsibility and was related to embezzlement, and transferred the entire case to the judiciary. On the 12th, Zhou Cheng, the secret member of the trial, acquitted He Shaokun and sent it to the High Court for retrial.</p>

<p>The number of teahouses in this county is the highest in the province. There are already 137 inside and outside the city. The county government previously decided to charge each teapot one copper coin to cover the regular expenses of the security corps. However, the teahouses did not pay the taxes they collected, resulting in a huge amount of arrears. Yesterday, the director of the department ordered seven representatives from each teahouse to be summoned to the case and strictly urged them. The representatives were unable to say anything, so they sent two people to detention, and five people went out to mediate. Unexpectedly, after the five people were released, all the teahouses suddenly went on strike in resistance. Those who did not owe tea donations were mostly coerced. Today, it is heard that there are still several people who are dividing up the various towns and saying orders, leading to actions to achieve the purpose of canceling the county government's orders.</p>

<p>According to the New Sound News Agency, following the decision to centralize bill clearing for silver and money shops, the Bank Sub-Committee decided on seven measures to be separately announced to both industries for compliance. These measures have been fully implemented since yesterday. The previously established restrictions on bill clearing for each bank have been abolished. Relief measures for money shops have been changed. A loan committee, jointly formed by the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Banca di Italia for China, and reserve organizations of both the silver and money industries, was established yesterday. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Temporary Measures for Bill Clearing</p>
<p>The Joint Reserve Committee of the Shanghai Banking Association has decided on temporary measures for silver and money shop bill clearing, as determined by the Small Adjustment Committee of the Banking Association. Entrusted with implementation, it has issued a circular to all banks for compliance. The original text of its Circular No. 76 reads: "To Whom It May Concern: At 5:00 PM on June 12th, the Bill Clearing Sub-Group Committee, formed by the Executive Committee of the Banking Association, discussed matters related to silver and money shop bill clearing. It was resolved to establish temporary measures to be implemented by this committee, as entrusted by the Banking Association. The measures are as follows: (1) From June 13th, all clearing banks, upon receiving payment bills from member money shops, shall uniformly affix a 'Received' stamp and submit them to this committee for collection. However, payment bills from non-member banks shall temporarily continue to be exchanged by each bank separately for money shop clearing slips before submitting them to this committee for collection. (The methods for collecting bills from non-member banks will be announced separately after this committee's facilities are fully equipped.) (2) Banks entrusting this committee to collect payment bills from money shops shall submit them to this committee at the following times daily, except for Sundays and holidays: First time: before 10:00 AM. (All payment bills from money shops received by each bank on the previous day shall be submitted to the committee before 10:00 AM.) Second time: before 12:30 PM. Third time: before 2:30 PM.

Banks entrusting this committee to collect payment bills from money shops on the due date shall submit the bills from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM. (3) Clearing bills receivable by banks from money shops shall be stamped 'Received' by this committee and sent to the paying money shops for confirmation. Before 4:00 PM, this committee shall collect clearing slips from each money shop for deposit into the silver industry reserve depot and submit them to the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications for cross-accounting. (4) Clearing bills receivable by money shops from banks shall be stamped 'Received' and sent to the paying banks for a receipt. Before 4:00 PM, the receiving money shops shall collect the clearing allocation slips from this committee from each bank and submit them to the money depot to account for each shop's transactions. The money depot will then consolidate and cross-account with the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. (5) Banks shall provide this committee with clearing allocation slips in a timely manner for clearing bills payable to non-member banks. (6) The time for returning bills between banks and money shops shall remain as before, until 6:00 PM on the same day. The procedure shall be for each bank or shop to directly return the bill to the original receiving bank or shop upon discovering the need for return and retrieve the money depot clearing slip or clearing allocation slip from this committee for transfer accounting.

This circular is hereby communicated for your information and compliance. The Money Shops Association has issued a similar circular, which is omitted for brevity.</p>
<p>Centralized Collection and Clearing Fully Implemented</p>

<p>Collateral Measures Have Been Changed</p>
<p>The New Sound News Agency learned from financial circles yesterday that the Ministry of Finance's allocation of 25 million yuan in financial public bonds from the 24th year of the Republic of China to provide relief to money shops has undergone changes to the previously established collateral borrowing measures (where each shop would submit collateral to the Money Industry Supervision Committee for review and, upon approval, would obtain financial public bonds according to the assessed value and then convert them into cash at a 60% discount at banks such as the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications). It is now heard that all money shops applying for collateral loans will submit collateral such as title deeds, public bonds, and goods to the Money Industry Reserve Depot. The depot will then submit them to the Money Industry Supervision Committee for review and, upon approval, they can borrow cash directly from the loan committee formed by banks such as the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. The financial public bonds allocated by the Ministry of Finance are designated as the secondary guarantee, while the depot's collateral is the primary guarantee. It is heard that the discounts are as follows: title deeds at 90% of the Municipal Council's valuation, public bonds at 100% of the market price, and goods at 80% of the market price. Collateral that has already been mortgaged will be supplemented according to the newly established measures.</p>
<p>Each Bank Assumes a Portion of the Total Loan Amount</p>

<h3 id="e112">Representatives of Five Exchanges Petitioned Kong Yesterday Afternoon; Request for Delay of Transaction Tax Granted; Gold Industry Petition Group to Petition Kong Today. <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Due to the scheduled collection of transaction taxes, which the five exchanges in this city are unable to bear, Gu Xinyi and Wang Yiting were specially elected as representatives to pay respects to Minister Kong yesterday afternoon, earnestly requesting a one-year delay in collection to maintain business difficulties. The petition group formed by gold brokers is scheduled to petition Minister Kong today, requesting a reduction in the new tax rate. A reporter from the Shiye News Agency investigated and recorded the details as follows:</p>
<p>Representatives of Five Exchanges Petitioned Yesterday Afternoon;</p>
<p>The Federation of Five Exchanges, through a meeting of directors, decided to elect Du Yuesheng as the representative to request Minister Kong to postpone the collection of transaction taxes. Until yesterday, because Mr. Du had other important business and was unable to go, Gu Xinyi of the Miscellaneous Grains Exchange and Wang Yiting of the Flour Exchange were specially elected as authorized representatives. At 12:30 yesterday, they carried the petition and went to the third floor of the Central Bank to pay respects to Minister Kong. Minister Kong personally received them. The representatives handed over the petition and stated that the five exchanges were in decline and unable to bear the heavy burden, requesting a one-year delay in collection to maintain business difficulties. Minister Kong did not immediately reply to the representatives' request but promised to postpone the collection date within a possible range. After talking for about half an hour, the representatives felt satisfied and then excused themselves. According to Mr. Gu, Minister Kong was very considerate of business difficulties and was very concerned about the poor operation of the five exchanges. The request for a delay in the collection of transaction taxes is likely to be approved. However, the length of the postponement must await the approval of the Ministry of Finance before it can be clarified.</p>
<p>Gold Industry Decides to Visit Kong Today</p>
<p>The tax rates promulgated by the Ministry of Finance this time for yarn, cloth, miscellaneous grains, flour, etc., are all one-tenth (securities are exempt and not included), but the tax rate for the gold industry is as high as two-tenths. The brokers' association of the exchange believes that this tax is closely related to its own business operations and is difficult to bear. Based on the resolution of the last general meeting, it has organized a full petition group to petition Minister Kong. According to the reporter, the association currently has over 110 members. If all of them were to visit Kong, the number would be too large. After a temporary decision yesterday, Zhan Liansheng, Wang Jiafu, Gao Qiumei, Wang Yingchang, Yu Yuhong, Dong Zaisheng, Weng Nianqu, You Shuren, Xia Wenfu, Su Zhongnian, Lu Junfu, Yuan Jinzhen, Ma Zongmao, Yue Zuyi, Fang Jiajun, and Nian Muxiu were elected as sixteen general representatives. They are scheduled to carry the petition at 10:00 AM today and go to Minister Kong's private residence on Xiai Ensi Road to petition Kong.</p>

<h3 id="e115">North China Overwhelmed by Foreign Cloth Dumping, Domestic Products Vanishing; Customs Tax Collection Procedures Should Be Corrected; Taxing Retail Sales in Sections Yields Less Than One-Third; Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association Petitions the Ministry of Finance for Prompt Correction <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>New Voice Agency reports: The strategies used by foreign goods to dump in our country are meticulous. Recently, cotton cloth merchants have further separated entire bolts of cotton cloth into sections and declared them as retail cloth for import. Because the tax paid is very small, the cost is extremely low, and they are heavily sold in North China, domestic cotton cloth is almost extinct. The machine dyeing and weaving industry association and other domestic goods groups in this port sent personnel to North China for investigation, recognizing the great harm to domestic cotton cloth. They jointly petitioned the Ministry of Finance to instruct the customs to correct the tax collection procedures. The original petition is excerpted below: A petition concerning foreign cloth evading tariffs, affecting domestic production and sales channels, requesting the Ministry to urgently instruct the customs to correct tax collection procedures. It is believed that tariff policy is essential for maintaining domestic industry. China's import tariff regulations are inferior to those of other countries due to various reasons. However, this assistance is an essential element for the barely maintaining the current situation of the nation's industrially weak foundation. The cotton cloth business operated by the employees of our association's factories can still exist today amidst this internal and external pressure, which is largely thanks to the protection of Article 94 of the current import tax regulations on cotton products. This is an undeniable fact. However, according to personnel sent by Sichuan to North China to investigate the cotton cloth situation, the tax collection procedures of Tianjin and other customs offices, regardless of the type of cotton cloth, estimate the price of lengths no more than one meter at 90 yuan per 100 kilograms, and calculate the tax at 15% ad valorem. For those less than half a meter, even lower taxes can be collected. In order to reduce import taxes, foreign merchants are competing to separate entire bolts of cotton cloth into sections and declare them for import. The tax paid is less than one-third of that of whole bolts of cotton cloth. It is estimated that ordinary goods can reduce costs by at least a quarter, and lighter and finer qualities can reduce them even more. This not only facilitates sales but is also favored by the economically backward people of the North. As a result, the North China market is completely dominated by this retail cloth (commonly known as "code pieces"), and domestic cloth is almost extinct. It is believed that the reason why domestic cotton cloth cannot be sold to North China is precisely because of the improper tax collection procedures of the customs. Furthermore, there are no specific regulations for the import tax of retail cloth, and it should be levied according to the same rules as other items in this category. Although there may have been errors in the past, it seems appropriate to correct them now. Therefore, we dare to urgently submit this petition, requesting your ministry to promptly instruct all customs offices to correct the tax collection procedures. In the future, when retail cloth is imported, it should all be taxed according to the same tax regulations as other items in this category, without allowing any tricks, in order to maintain domestic production. This is truly in the public interest.</p>

<p>Central News Agency reports: Central Committee member Wang Zhengting, accompanied by his secretary Liu Yunfang, took the Beijing-Shanghai express train from Shanghai to Beijing at noon on the 12th to visit President Wang. He will return to Shanghai in about three or four days. It is rumored that Wang will be appointed to go to the United States.

<p>After the Shanghai head office, Qingdao branch, and Pingyuan sub-branch of the Minghua Bank successively suspended operations and were liquidated, the temporary shareholders' meeting held a few days ago failed due to insufficient quorum.

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Recruitment Team Headquarters of the China Aviation Association, in order to raise funds for aviation national salvation, sent a letter to various trades, requesting them to collect an aviation national salvation donation of 5% of their business income, according to business income standards. This has been implemented one after another.

(4) An aviation national salvation donation collection committee for the sand and gravel industry will be established immediately, organized by the association's existing executive committee members. (5) The first meeting will be held on the 20th of this month to discuss practical matters. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM. This shows the enthusiasm of the industry in supporting the aviation national salvation movement.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Two Silk Associations Meet in Shanghai; Improvement Association Discusses Budget for the 24th Year; Control Association Organizes Two Silk Reeling and Sales Committees <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The East China News Agency reports: Zeng Yangfu, director of the Zhejiang Construction Department, was summoned to Sichuan to supervise the construction of highways. The affairs of the Silk Improvement Committee of the National Economic Committee and the Silk Control Association of the Construction Department have been taken over by Tan Xihong, director of the Agriculture and Forestry Department of the Ministry of Industry. Tan convened a meeting of the standing committee members of the Improvement Association, Wu Shenbo, Ge Jingzhong, Leng Yuqiu, and He Shangdan, at the Commodity Inspection Bureau yesterday to discuss the budget and important facilities for the 24th year. At the same time, he convened a meeting of the members of the Control Association, Wang Guohua, Wu Shenbo, Ge Jingzhong, Shen Jiuru, He Shangdan, Xia Chenxiang, and Li Shuchu, to discuss the organization of two committees for silk reeling and sales. The details are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Budget of the Improvement Association</p>
<p>The original budget for the 24th year of the Improvement Association was 400,000 national currency. Now, due to the attachment of the Economic Committee, the budget is changed to a fiscal year budget. The first half of the 24th year is included in the 23rd year, and the 24th year will run from July of the 24th year to the end of June of the 25th year. Therefore, the funds of 400,000 yuan should be re-allocated and a budget prepared. The meeting yesterday decided to reduce routine expenses and increase event-specific expenses, with special emphasis on basic silk undertakings, such as mulberry cultivation, silkworm rearing, weighing, and silk reeling.</p>
<p>Meeting of the Control Association</p>
<p>After discussing the budget, the Control Association meeting was convened. First, Tan reported that the spring silkworm crop this year was excellent due to favorable weather and good silkworm breeds. The improved variety reached 80%, and the native variety reached 49%. Although the cocoon price was very low, the farmers' income did not decrease because the silkworm rearing period increased by more than half. Silk merchants also went to Zhejiang to purchase cocoons due to the low cocoon price. In total, 6 million yuan of cocoon money was injected into Zhejiang Province, which is a small compensation for the farmers in this time of rural decline. Next, Shen Jiuru reported on the cocoon collection situation. Cocoon collection was divided into ten districts this period. The collection amount of the improved variety was 100,000 dan (of which 61,000 dan were purchased under government control), and the native variety was 170,000 dan, totaling 190,000 dan. Calculated at 420 jin of silk reeled from the improved variety and 500 jin of silk reeled from the native variety, approximately 80,000 dan or more of silk can be obtained.</p>
<p>Silk Reeling Committee</p>
<p>The regulations of the Reeling Association were discussed and approved, and Tan Xihong was appointed as the chairman, with Wu Shenbo, Shen Jiuru, and Xia Chenxiang as standing committee members. The factories that have been contacted for reeling include Hui Lun, Hangzhou, Yongcheng, Changxing, and so on in Zhejiang, and Yongsheng, Yuqi, Hu, Zhengyi, and Yuchang in Jiangsu. The five factories in Zhejiang borrowed 500 multi-end silk reeling machines from the Silk Improvement Association last year, so their equipment is very complete. The quality of the five factories in Jiangsu has long been famous in Europe and the United States, and it is expected that the quality of the silk from each factory will be satisfactory.</p>
<p>Sales Committee</p>
<p>The regulations of the Sales Committee were also passed at this meeting, and Wu Shenbo was appointed as the chairman, with Chen Xilin, Zheng Guohua, and Shen Jiuru as standing committee members. The committee has also planned to set up an office in Shanghai, with Li Shuchu appointed as manager and Ji Junyi as deputy manager.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Chamber of Commerce Informs the Court That Stamp Duty Should Be Affixed to the First Page of Loose-Leaf Account Statements <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Jiangsu Shanghai Local Court yesterday, stating: "We are writing to you to inform you that on the 20th of this month, according to a letter from the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Association, the Da Shun Company stated that on April 13th, stamp duty inspectors came to inspect their account books and found no cases of missing or insufficient stamp duty. Later, they took away more than ten pages of cost statements from the small company, copied from Han's 668 to the last batch, and a cash flow book from 12 years ago with stamp duty already affixed, but with a few pages remaining at the end listing inventory quantities. Afterwards, our manager personally went to the bureau to explain the nature of these statements and requested their immediate return. The response was that the statements had already been forwarded to the local court. The nature of the cost statements is merely a notification for accounting purposes, and they are compiled from individual sheets. Affixing stamp duty to the first page is not subject to penalties according to the stamp duty regulations. The officer's act of taking them away on this pretext is an abuse of power, and forwarding them to the local court is also inappropriate. We were instructed to forward this information to seek relief. Our chamber received approval No. 5536 from the Ministry of Finance in May of this year, stating that if the document is of the same nature as an internal bank voucher, it should be affixed to the outside of the book if it is compiled into a volume, and each sheet should be exempt from further stamp duty. Various report forms, if compiled into volumes, should be affixed with stamp duty according to the loose-leaf account book regulations. According to the regulations for affixing stamp duty to loose-leaf account books, according to the Ministry of Finance's approval No. 927 of November of the 18th year, loose-leaf account books should still be calculated annually according to the regulations. The stamp duty should be affixed to the first page, where the month and year are written, at a rate of 1 corner per volume per year. According to the above-mentioned ministry's approval, for those used for audits, regardless of whether they are called statements or forms, as long as they are treated as account books, stamp duty should be affixed to the first page and not to every page. Since the Da Shun Company's cost statements have stamp duty affixed to the first page, following the ministry's order, there is no violation of the regulations. Accordingly, we are sending this case file to you for your reference, and we hope that you will investigate it."</p>

<p>The state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Shanghai-Ningbo line Jiangren vessel previously adopted a contract system, with Xu Yulian as the business director. Each round trip was to yield 1,700 yuan in freight. Recently, due to the low volume of cargo and passengers, the full amount could not be paid, so Xu resigned. The resignation was approved, and the general manager's office decided to abolish the contract system and appoint Chen Yiting as the business manager, who took over on the morning of yesterday and sailed to Ningbo as usual at 5:00 PM. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has already changed the contract system vessels, including Xinming, Xinfeng, Haiyan, Jiangjing, and now Xinjingtian, making a total of five vessels. Furthermore, the New Jiangtian's tea room has always been poorly managed, and the number of personnel is the largest, totaling 300 plus people. There may be hope for thorough improvement in the future.</p>

<p>Regarding the news of the third group wedding in this city on the 6th of this month, it was reported by the Da Gong She that out of the 54 couples who were to be married, the 16th and 25th couples were temporarily absent, and the 19th couple, Liu Zhihuan and Sun Jingyun, were said to be bigamous and were refused to participate. According to inquiries made by this newspaper after the event, the news is completely inconsistent with the facts. Only Xia Xinzai and Wen Renxiu withdrew on their own initiative and did not participate.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Sino-French Savings Society to Discontinue Prize-Linked Savings; Prize-Winning Accounts to Be Transferred to Special Savings; The Number of Prize-Winning Numbers Reduced, Already Completed <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The New Voice Agency reports: The Sino-French Savings Society was established in August of the Republic's seventh year, initially specializing in prize-linked savings. It was a Sino-French joint venture, registered with the French Consulate in Tianjin and the Chinese government. It was reorganized into a Chinese joint-stock company in the Republic's fifteenth year, and the French shares were completely redeemed. It was approved and licensed by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce of the Beijing government. In April of the Republic's twenty-third year, it submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance to establish a special department for ordinary savings, with a capital of 450,000 yuan. The total prize-linked savings association paid 15 yuan per month until January of this year. From March onwards, in compliance with the Ministry of Finance's order, prize-linked savings were discontinued. In addition to ceasing to accept new accounts, it specially established in the ordinary savings department (1) special installment savings with fixed amounts and (2) special lump-sum savings with fixed amounts. The above two types of deposits were established in response to the request of depositors of the prize-linked savings department to transfer their deposits to the ordinary savings department. The term is the sum of the years already paid in the prize-linked savings department and the years of continued savings in the ordinary savings department, totaling 14 years. At the same time, depositors of the prize-linked savings department were notified to transfer to special savings. However, depositors who wished to withdraw their funds according to Article 22 of Chapter 4 of the prize-linked savings regulations were allowed to do so. The June prize-linked savings will be awarded on the 15th of this month at the Beijing head office in accordance with the previous method. However, the number of depositors has decreased significantly in May, so the numbers and prize amounts will be reduced proportionally. In recent days, many prize-linked depositors have applied to the association to transfer to special savings, but very few have withdrawn their funds because it is not cost-effective.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Summer is Here; Beware of Dangerous Drinks <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The Public Works Department's health department has issued a serious warning to residents within the concession that caution should be exercised in food and drink as summer has arrived. According to reports, certain beverages on the market are labeled "Orange Juice" and other "Fruit Juices" or "Fruit Syrups." According to chemical tests, these beverages are actually not suitable for human consumption, but sellers are rampant in the market, especially street vendors. Drinking them can easily lead to illness, especially in children. Therefore, anyone who pays attention to hygiene should purchase necessary beverages from reliable stores and ensure that they are completely sealed and the contents are pure. Do not be fooled by names such as orange juice and fruit juice, and do not be tempted by cheap prices to cause danger.</p>

<p>The three-year-old son of a wealthy Shen family in Songjiang was suddenly abducted by several kidnappers last month. They then received a letter from the kidnappers demanding a ransom of 15,000 yuan and instructing them to contact them in Shanghai. The Shen family sent people to Shanghai to negotiate with the kidnappers and had already handed over several hundred yuan to their accomplices. Recently, Shen received another letter from the kidnappers, urging them to continue negotiations. Shen sent someone to Shanghai again and met at the Qingxun Pavilion on Sima Road on the afternoon of the day before yesterday to discuss the ransom, but no agreement was reached. They then continued to discuss the price at Room 37 of the Yong An Hotel on Fujian Road. This was detected by detectives from the New Gate Police Station. At 1:00 AM yesterday morning, all Chinese and foreign detectives went to Room 37 of the Yong An Hotel and arrested the kidnappers Wang A'san and Hao Shicai. Based on the confessions of Wang and Hao, three more accomplices, including Chen A'jin, were arrested in a thatched shed in Jiangbang, and two pistols and more than thirty bullets were seized. They were taken back to the police station. Subsequently, four accomplices, including Chen Gaofu, were arrested at No. 8 Huishan Lane, Huishan Road. The location of the hostage has also been discovered, and teams have been dispatched to rescue the hostage and arrest the remaining accomplices. It is expected that the entire gang will be captured and the hostage will be rescued. The criminals will be sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation this morning.</p>

<p>This year's hygiene promotion also focuses on kitchen cleanliness, so a kitchen competition is held, which is divided into two types. Yesterday, a notice was issued saying: "Dear Sir/Madam, the 14th Hygiene Campaign in this city is scheduled to start on June 15. At that time, a city-wide kitchen competition will be held, divided into two types: one is a public kitchen competition, especially focusing on the kitchens of restaurants and hotels, and the other is a private kitchen competition. Registration is now open. If your establishment wishes to participate in this competition, please fill out the registration form at the office of this committee on the upper floor of the Dahua Bank at 510 Nanjing Road before June 15. This office will notify you of the date, and the judging committee will come to judge. If it meets the hygiene standards, this committee will not only formally announce your establishment's name, address, and the names of the responsible personnel in the newspaper, but also award prizes at the hygiene campaign exhibition site on June 21 according to the judging results. Accordingly, this letter is sent for your reference."</p>
<h3 id="e136">Campaign Conference Issues Declaration <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The declaration of the 14th Hygiene Campaign in this city states: "Shanghai, a metropolis in the East with three million residents, has the most modern buildings and the most advanced transportation. However, what are the lifestyles of the residents in this small metropolis? What is their health like? If we examine the daily or recreational lives of the citizens, we will easily find that they are living anesthetized or decadent lives of pleasure in the most irregular and unhygienic habits, gambling and dancing wildly day and night, even to the point of soliciting prostitutes, making them mentally weak and physically frail. On the other hand, many citizens struggling for a living spend their lives in the most unhygienic environments or jobs. At the same time, we absolutely cannot deny that our people are too neglectful of hygiene, or at least too inattentive to it. They almost all have traditional unhygienic bad habits. We statistically find that every year, the people's illnesses and deaths, just from tuberculosis deaths alone, number 1.6 million nationwide. This is truly a staggering number. Every time the door is opened, the first gift that foreign countries bring to our country is opium, followed by heroin, red pills, sent into our country by the thousands upon thousands. Thus, our people by the thousands upon thousands are corrupted and anesthetized. In this city, the pervasiveness of poisons is even more frighteningly vast, and countless citizens are entangled in this chronic killing poison, walking to the grave day by day. Therefore, the holding of this 14th Hygiene Campaign should be said to contain the most significant meaning. Our points of attention are divided into personal hygiene and public hygiene, and at the same time, we especially focus on the official publicity of drug rehabilitation. (1) Personal hygiene, everyone must remember the saying 'A sound mind in a sound body,' especially in this year of extreme social and economic decline, if an individual does not have a healthy body, they will never be able to overcome such a difficult environment. Therefore, personal hygiene should be paid attention to and strived for as much as possible. Bad habits that harm the body should be eliminated as soon as possible. All preventive scientific methods should be absolutely trusted. We must protect our own health and develop good hygiene habits ourselves. (2) Public hygiene, without public hygiene, there is no personal hygiene. Its impact extends to the economy and the nation, deeply and significantly. But our nation is very unfortunate, the most lacking in hygiene ethics. Spitting everywhere, dumping garbage at will, feces without management, mosquitoes and flies everywhere. To seek fundamental improvement, there is absolutely no hope of success without gathering the strength of the people. (3) Anti-Drug Publicity, the harm of uselessly persuading poisons to our health is very dangerous. We have no statistics, but we know that it directly and indirectly poisoned countless lives. Poison is prevalent throughout the country and has penetrated deeply into this city. If we do not eliminate poisons early, we will inevitably be killed by poisons in the future. This hygiene campaign pays special attention to anti-drug publicity, which is of great significance. The hygiene campaign has already had fourteen sessions, but this is not much, or it can be said that it has only just begun. The history that follows will be intertwined with human culture. Every time we hold a hygiene campaign, it is not a repetition, but to make it follow the laws of nature and evolve continuously, so it cannot avoid having new additions, and it cannot but have new additions. But on the other hand, the hygiene campaign is by no means an unrelated independent movement, but a continuous inheritance with its basic links, so it cannot avoid having the same places, and it cannot but have considerable places."</p>
<h3 id="e137">Major Theft Case Solved; Perpetrator Apprehended in Shanghai; Approved for Transfer to Jiading County Government <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The Jiayu Commercial Bank in Jiading County was visited by thieves on the night of March 9 this year. They dug through the wall, entered, pried open the iron safe, and stole 1,000 plus several hundred yuan in cash. The bank reported the theft to the Jiading County Government Public Security Bureau, requesting investigation and arrest. The Public Security Bureau recently apprehended a suspect in the case, Zhou Cai, a native of Jiangbei. Under interrogation, he confessed to conspiring to commit the theft and stated that the mastermind was Yang Xizi, also known as Song Changfa, a native of Jiangbei, hiding at No. 55 Rongqing Lane, Dagu Road, Public Concession, Shanghai. Therefore, Jiading Public Security Bureau Detective Sun Long, accompanied by Zhou Cai, came to Shanghai by car at 6 PM the day before yesterday, reporting to the Chengdu Road Police Station, requesting assistance in the arrest. The police first ordered detectives to secretly monitor No. 55 Rongqing Lane, Dagu Road. Unexpectedly, Yang Xizi learned of this, surrendered to the police station, and was taken into custody after being questioned. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Jiading Public Security Bureau Detective Sun Bin submitted an official document requesting permission to transfer Yang Xizi for prosecution and trial according to law. According to the confession of the accomplice Zhou Cai, "At 10 PM on the night of March 9 this year, Yang Xizi, Yang's friend, and I jointly stole from the Jiading Commercial Bank. We first dug a hole in the brick wall, and Yang and others went inside, while I stood guard outside. After obtaining the money, Yang and the other two took it away, and I didn't get a cent. I went to Yang's house afterwards, so I knew his address," and so on. When questioned, Yang Xizi claimed to be in the duck and chicken business and denied committing the theft, claiming that he did not know Zhou and was being framed. The police station lawyer Qian Yi then expressed his opinion, stating that Yang had been arrested and prosecuted for assaulting a public works employee on August 18 last year, resulting in an acquittal. He was also arrested for theft on March 6 last year, but again escaped conviction and was acquitted. Now that he has been arrested for the third time, and the Jiading County Government has substantial evidence and the accomplice's confession, the police station does not object to the transfer. Judge Liu Guigui approved the transfer of Song Changfa, also known as Yang Xizi, to the Jiading County Government for investigation and trial.</p>

<p>Laozha Police Station West Detective Crow, and Chinese Detective Liu Junqing, learned that at No. 1238 Yuyuan Road, Shanghai, there was a secret large-scale morphine drug manufacturing facility established by the Japanese. Yesterday (the 13th), at about 5:30 PM, they, along with the Chief Inspector of the Japanese Consulate, Suzukawa Masaichi, the Squad Leader of Caojiadu Public Security Bureau, Long Jianpo, and a large number of detectives, secretly went to the location. It was a detached Western-style house, with a Japanese flag hanging. They immediately entered and found the facility fully equipped. Inside, there was a large box of finished morphine, four large vats of unfinished morphine, and a large amount of opium raw materials, ovens, machines, and all kinds of equipment. They immediately inventoried the items and sent people to guard them. They arrested the Japanese proprietor Qiu Ya Yuebo, Chinese shareholder Li Tianfu (36 years old, from Ningbo), assistants Bao A'er, Zhuang Haiquan, Wang Ziwu, Xu Maofeng, and five others, along with a privately-owned car (Concession license number 827), and took them all back to the police station to await transfer to the Special District Court for trial.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Accountant and Lawyer Sun Zhongyao Accused of Falsely Reporting Creditor's Rights and Breaching His Duty; Trial Opened Yesterday, Settlement Hoped For <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Accountant and lawyer Sun Zhongyao, whose office is located on the fourth floor of 294 Edward Road, has recently been sued by Shi Yujiao, the legal representative of Xiamen Commercial Bank, through lawyer Yu Ao, to the Criminal Division of the First Special Court, accusing him of falsely reporting creditor's rights, breaching his duty, and committing fraud and breach of trust. The reasons for the lawsuit are briefly as follows: The defendant was appointed as the elected liquidator of the Fu Ning Shipping Co., Ltd. on May 4 of this year. The defendant published a public notice and convened a creditors' meeting at the defendant's office on the 10th to review the registered creditor's rights. The defendant reported the company's assets and liabilities. On June 14, the liquidator prepared a liquidation statement of Fu Ning Shipping Co., Ltd., listing assets of 174,540 yuan in national currency and total liabilities of 242,000,182 yuan and 78 cents. The company's assets were insufficient to pay off debts. The defendant not only did not apply for a bankruptcy declaration, but also ignored the plaintiff's reminder on the 16th, causing the liquidation to stall, damaging the plaintiff's huge interests. He should be punished in accordance with Article 232, Paragraph 1, Item 7 of the Company Law. Since the defendant is the liquidator, he should immediately list creditor's rights and debts based on the company's books. However, the defendant fabricated Xu Shu, resulting in compensation of 3,000 yuan for creditor's rights and a remuneration of 1,250 yuan in silver dollars, which were not found in the company's books or resolutions, thus committing the crime of fraud and breach of trust under Article 366 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yang opened the Eighth Criminal Division to summon the defendant. The defendant did not appear. The plaintiff's lawyer Yu Aokui stated that because there was hope for a settlement in this case, he requested a postponement. The court approved the request.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Eurasia Aviation Corporation Fourth Anniversary Commemoration; Business Report Released; Progress Made in Technical Construction and Talent Training; Company Revenue Still Cannot Offset Expenses <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>It has been four years since the establishment of Eurasia Aviation Corporation. The General Manager of the company, Mr. Li Jingcong, in order to let the public understand the value and significance of the international aviation industry, specially released the company's business progress in the past four years on the occasion of the company's fourth anniversary.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Founding Through Many Twists and Turns <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Eurasia Aviation Corporation was initially established in the winter of the 10th year of the Republic of China. On May 30, October 1, of that year, formal flights between Shanghai and Manchouli began, which is now the fourth anniversary. If we trace the preparations for the establishment, it started in the 17th year of the Republic of China, which is now more than six years ago. In the four years since its establishment, the Shanghai-Manchouli route was abandoned due to the Northeast Incident, and the Shanghai-Xinjiang route was temporarily suspended due to the Xinjiang coup. Therefore, the function of international air transportation between Eurasia is temporarily difficult to realize. However, the main purpose of Eurasia Aviation Corporation is the completion of the most convenient air transportation between Eurasia. In the past, water transportation between Eurasia was not convenient, such as sailing around the Cape of Good Hope because of geographical advantages. It was not convenient until the opening of the Suez Canal thanks to scientific developments. Today, air transportation between Eurasia is also not convenient if it only follows densely populated areas, wasting time and detouring around the southern coast of the two continents. It is necessary to use scientific developments, have the necessary equipment, and master special skills to make it possible to fly over the plateau of Central Asia. The opening of the Suez Canal was preempted by the Saxon people to dominate their Eastern colonies. Now that the problem of air transportation is at hand, how can our Chinese nation allow others to take the lead again in the direct flight route between Eurasia through Central Asia? This is why Eurasia Aviation Corporation must be established. However, our country's material civilization is still lagging behind. If we rely solely on domestic technology and organization to promote it, time will not wait for us. If we delay a little, others will seize the opportunity. Moreover, this matter is originally an international business, and in fact, it must be done in cooperation with others. This is another reason why Eurasia Aviation Corporation must allow German participation under the principle of utilizing foreign capital advocated by the Premier.</p>
<h3 id="e142">After the End of World War I <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>I personally witnessed the possibility of aircraft being used as transportation tools in Europe, which became increasingly concrete. I was then contemplating the establishment of air transportation between Eurasia. In the 17th year of the Republic of China, German Lufthansa also intended to discuss this matter with our country. I discussed it with its representative, Mr. Schmidt, in Beiping, and immediately suggested its implementation to the Party and State government. After receiving the key points, Mr. Schmidt immediately came south, and I was ordered to draft a contract with him. At that time, we considered the five main points of the contract: (1) The route should start from Shanghai, and we should strive to pass through Central Asia and fly directly to Europe. However, in order to leave room for flexibility, we set three routes: Shanghai-Manchouli, Shanghai-Mongolia, and Shanghai-Xinjiang, with the completion of the Shanghai-Xinjiang route (the most convenient route through Central Asia) as the ultimate goal. The organization of the joint venture should be a company subject to Chinese law. (3) The business and cooperation spirit should be handled under the principle of mutual benefit, but the Chinese share capital should account for 25%. The management rights of the company belong to the board of directors, which allocates the number of people according to the proportion of share capital. (4) The German side should provide the Chinese side with full technical and capital loans. The debts arising from the capital loans should not affect the shareholding. (5) In the early stage of the company's establishment, although the German side may be responsible for managing flight technology affairs, it should immediately start training qualified Chinese personnel in the country and Germany so that they can gradually be competent for part or all of the technical affairs.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Contract Negotiations Proceeded <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>For more than a year, there were intermittent interruptions until September of the 19th year, when an agreement was finally reached and signed by the Ministry of Communications and Lufthansa. The various points held by our side were fulfilled one by one. The company was initially established in June of the 10th year. On May 31 of the same year, it had already started the first transportation of air mail between Eurasia on its Shanghai-Manchouli route. However, the ultimate goal of the company's business is still the Shanghai-Xinjiang route through Central Asia, not the Shanghai-Manchouli route. However, because the direct flight route to the Far East planned by the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, and other countries had not yet been completed, the operation of the Shanghai-Manchouli route could shorten the delivery time of mail between Eurasia by about four or five days, and because it was technically easier to implement, it could be completed quickly, so it was used as a transitional route.</p>
<h3 id="e144">When the September 18th Incident Occurred <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The passage through the three northeastern provinces was suddenly impossible. At that time, the Far East route planned by the United Kingdom, France, and the Netherlands had already taken shape. The company resolutely abandoned the Shanghai-Manchouli route and sought to open a route with the ultimate goal. However, at that time, the center of the company's technical organization was located in Beiping, the midpoint of the Shanghai-Manchouli route, so it was planned to take Beiping as the starting point and fly directly to Xinjiang to reach the Russian border. All the places along the route were planned to be Bailingmiao, Ruoshui River, Dihua, and Tacheng. Whether it was possible to fly through these areas, which are high mountains, vast deserts, and areas with harsh climates, was not clear at the time, but because the survival of the company's business was at stake, we had to make a desperate gamble.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Made a Risky Test Flight <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>In just one month, various connecting materials along the way were transported to Beiping. In June of the 10th year, I and the German pilot Lu Ci made the first test flight from Beiping. As a result, we safely arrived in Dihua in just 18 hours. The company's business was revived, and colleagues celebrated each other. Although this test flight was technically successful, it was still not economical. Therefore, it was finally decided to take Shanghai as the starting point, so that we could stop at the capital, the provisional capital, the auxiliary capital, and Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu Province, as well as Jiuquan and Hami, which are the key points in the northwest, to reach Tonghua. Not only is it more convenient to transport supplies to these places, but there must also be more business volume. As for the flight distance, it takes 18 hours to fly from Beiping to Tonghua, which takes two days, while it only takes one day to fly from Shanghai to Tonghua and use faster aircraft. Therefore, the company decided to</p>

<p>Which is closely related to Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Xinjiang, and the northwest. After more than a year of hard work, the various facilities and supply organizations on the Shanghai-Xinjiang route have been perfected and consolidated. It has also been officially opened to traffic for three months. Currently, the section from Lanzhou to Dihua has been temporarily suspended, but it can be restored as soon as the political situation in Xinjiang improves. In the past two years, the Lanzhou-Baotou and Ping-Guangdong routes, which have been approved by the Ministry of Communications, are not only necessary for absorbing air mail from various places when international traffic is opened in the future, but also can be used as temporary supplements when the Shanghai-Xinjiang route has not yet resumed. The company's survival is not a problem, so the future prospects are unlimited. Since the company has a substantial</p>

<p>It lies in the construction of technology and the training of talents. This was already said to be the most central issue when negotiating the cooperation agreement with the German side. Regarding the training of qualified Chinese personnel, in addition to the fact that foreign personnel with more experience must still be hired temporarily in terms of driving, due to the special terrain and climate within each route, some mechanics, most mechanics, and some telecommunications personnel have been replaced by domestic personnel. A training department has been set up in the repair shop to continuously train mechanics and electrical personnel in grades. In addition, several trainees have been sent by German Lufthansa to practice. Recently, transportation driving training has also been started at home and abroad.

<h3 id="e149">Teacher Escorts Female Student Home, Thugs Commit Robbery, Accuse Teacher and Student of Improper Conduct, One Suspect Arrested for Investigation <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Xu Biao, a teacher at a certain school on Yangshupu Road, 16 years old, was escorting a female student home at 5:30 PM on the 8th of this month. While passing near Qiqihar Road and Longjiang Road, they were stopped by four men including Chen Zhitang from Ningbo. The men accused Xu of having an ambiguous relationship with the female student, beat him up, and robbed him of a wallet containing ten yuan. They then fled. The Yu Lin Road police station was notified, and detectives were dispatched, but they found nothing. The next day, a man named Zhou Xiangyun offered to mediate for Xu, saying that the mastermind was Bu Shengmin, and was willing to compensate for the stolen money. They agreed to meet for tea at the Fuxing Teahouse on Qiqihar Road the day before yesterday at noon. Xu went on time and met Chen on Danyang Road, who was then handed over to police station number 1186 and taken into custody. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the first division of the Special District Court. Wang Yaotang, a lawyer from the bureau, stated that the defendant said at the police station that the incident was due to the plaintiff's lewd behavior with the female student Wang Ruifang. Bu Shengmin (Wenming Xiaokai) found out about it, and invited others to assault him. He did not steal any silver dollars. It was found that Guo Xiaokai was a hooligan in the Qiqihar area and the son of a Chinese detective at police station number 446 of the Yangshupu precinct. When his father was questioned, he claimed that his unfilial son had long been expelled for misbehavior. The case is to be investigated thoroughly. According to the plaintiff Xu Liang, there were four people in total at the time. He clearly saw the defendant and another person hold his hands, slap him in the face, and then strike his chest and waist, and steal his wallet containing ten yuan. The female student was harassed by Guo. At the time, he was escorting her home. There was no other improper relationship. Later, Guo and Zhou Xiangyun pleaded for leniency, willing to compensate for the stolen money and medical expenses. On the way to the teahouse to discuss the matter, they encountered the defendant and he was arrested. Questioned, the defendant said that the plaintiff was stalking the female student, and Dun Xiaokai asked him to help slap him, which Guo also did. He did not steal the wallet, please investigate. Jiang Shuzi ordered the suspect to remain in custody pending further investigation.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, since the Shanghai headquarters of the International Savings Society encountered difficulties with mortgages, branches in various provinces, cities, and counties in the interior have also experienced similar situations. A reporter from the Central News Agency, in order to understand the internal situation of the society, specially visited a banker yesterday to inquire about everything. According to him, the society's Western directors, including Biman, Fanu, and Panteng, recently invited Chinese bankers Qian Xinzhi, Ye Zhuotang, Li Fuxun, Chen Xing, Song Ziliang, etc., to a meeting in the director's office on the third floor of the Central Bank. Although the content was not published, it was nothing more than how to continue to maintain the society. However, judging from the current situation, the society has invested a lot in real estate. Even with the lower real estate prices, the value should still be around 70%. Therefore, if the society has sufficient ability to raise cash in the near future, it should not encounter any serious problems. However, after this turmoil, there will be no new customers joining, and the scope will gradually shrink, which is to be expected.</p>

<p>Liu Haisu, the principal of the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts, was ordered by the government in the winter of 1933 to go to Germany to preside over the Berlin Chinese Art Exhibition, promote national culture, and communicate between Chinese and Western art. Its scale was grand, solemn, and enthusiastic, creating a new record for China's international literary and artistic movement. After the Berlin exhibition closed, Liu went to Paris, Switzerland, the Netherlands, London, and other places for exhibitions, a total of fourteen locations. Hundreds of thousands of people viewed the exhibitions, influencing the whole of Europe. Recently, although the London art exhibition has closed and many other places have requested exhibitions, Liu has declined due to time constraints. Liu has already departed from London on the 14th of last month on the German new ship "Xianghuasi Tuo" in cabin number 137 to return to China. He was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday (the 13th), but a telegram was received stating that the ship's boiler was damaged in the Suez Canal and is currently being repaired, so the arrival will be delayed until around the 25th of this month. Liu's return to China this time will surely contribute his two years of experience and observations to China's art world, revitalizing its atmosphere. Cultural groups and friends of Liu in Shanghai are preparing a warm welcome, and it is expected to be a grand occasion.</p>

<p>Rickshaw pullers from various districts of the city, requesting the mutual aid society to publish ten months of accounts, implement new rules, and provide formal relief to rickshaw pullers, held a joint meeting of rickshaw pullers from various districts at 32 Qianyi Lane, Tiantong Road, Hongkou yesterday afternoon. More than 30 people including Bian Qingzhong, Dai Kerong, Chen Zhengru, and Xu Hanyuan attended. Bian Qingzhong was elected chairman and Dai Kerong was elected secretary. After formal greetings, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting. Then, rickshaw pullers from various districts stood up and reported their registration certificates and badge numbers. The chairman then put forward various important issues for discussion. Regarding the case of whether the mutual aid society's accounts should be audited, it was resolved that since the mutual aid society was organized with the donations of rickshaw pullers, who have contributed a total of seven yuan and five jiao per rickshaw over ten months (each rickshaw puller is only allowed to pull ten shifts per month, with a donation of five fen per shift, totaling seven jiao and five fen per month), a request should be made to publish all the accounts in accordance with the law. (2) Regarding the implementation of the new rules, it was resolved that rickshaw pullers should first directly negotiate with the board of directors and the mutual aid society, and then elect representatives to ask the two directors of the mutual aid society who are also rickshaw merchants to present the matter at the meeting, requesting the mutual aid society to formally implement the new rules. (3) Regarding the case of requesting the mutual aid society to provide relief to rickshaw pullers, it was resolved that in this hot weather, the mutual aid society should be requested to distribute a straw hat, a set of clothing, and a pair of straw sandals to each rickshaw puller as soon as possible, as well as distribute medicine and administer vaccinations to prevent epidemics. Furthermore, considering the summer heat, the tea stations sponsored by various mutual aid societies on the roads are still lacking. It was resolved that the above cases should be submitted to the board of directors and the mutual aid society for immediate implementation. As a temporary motion, it was decided to appoint rickshaw puller representatives to petition and negotiate with the board of directors of the Public Concession, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, and the Vehicle Management Committee on issues such as vehicle fares.</p>

<p>The existing factory site of the Ren De Textile Factory at 590 Linqing Road is the factory's own property.

<p>The Yixing Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai has been established for almost two years, and its work has been progressing effectively.

<p>The case of He Baosheng, a coppersmith from Shaoxing working on the British Swire Company's "Lexington" ship, who died by jumping into the sea in American waters last year, has caused much speculation and the truth remains unclear. The Chinese government is investigating the matter. When the "Lexington" sailed to Shanghai this time, the Municipal Public Security Bureau was ordered to thoroughly investigate the case, and took the ship's stoker chief Tu Decai, seaman chief Jiang Fucai, and Chen Tongbei, Le A'er, etc. to the bureau for questioning. Unexpectedly, the deceased's family falsely accused the Shaoxing Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai, claiming that Tu, Jiang, etc. were suspects and requesting their detention and forbidding them to work. As a result, Tu Decai, etc. were almost dismissed by the company. Fortunately, with the guarantee of the Chinese Seamen's Union and the Yan Ying General Association, they were able to regain their freedom and return to work. It is now heard that after this case occurred, the families of Tu Decai, etc. complained to the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai, seeking justice. The association, based on the relationship between fellow provincials, sent letters and dispatched Dong Xinqin to the Shaoxing Fellow-Provincials Association and the Chinese Seamen's Union to investigate. The letter to the Seamen's Union reads: "We are writing to you concerning the complaint of Tu Gao's and Jiang Xie's families from our fellow province, stating that their husbands Tu Decai, Jiang Fucai, etc. have been working as stokers and seamen on ships for a long time. They are honest and law-abiding and serve as stoker chief and seaman chief on the British Swire Company's 'Lexington' ship. Half a day ago, He Baosheng, a coppersmith from Shaoxing on the same ship, committed suicide by jumping into the sea in American waters for unknown reasons. The cause of death is unclear, and the autumn government is investigating. When the 'Lexington' sailed to Shanghai this time, the Municipal Public Security Bureau was ordered to thoroughly investigate the case, and took those involved in the work, such as Tu Decai, Jiang Fucai, Chen Tongbei, Le A'er, etc., to the bureau for questioning. Unexpectedly, the Shaoxing Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai requested the Public Security Bureau to detain them and forbid them to work based on the one-sided words of the deceased's family. Their husbands' positions were almost terminated by the company. Fortunately, the gentlemen of the Chinese Seamen's Union upheld justice and made every effort to rescue them, allowing them to regain their freedom and return to work. However, after this case occurred, not only was the reputation of their husbands harmed, but the case is still pending and may cause even greater harm. We ask you to handle this matter according to the law. We check that Jiang and Tu have been serving on ships for a long time, and they are all known to be loyal, diligent and thrifty by the workers in the seaman and stoker gangs. This time they were innocently implicated and almost lost their jobs. Fortunately, your union supported them strongly, and we, members of the association, are deeply grateful. However, the state of the case is not yet resolved and further trouble must be guarded against. Our association should pay attention to post-event matters with your union. We have sent Dong Xinqin, our staff to see you, so please give us your guidance as we ask this from Chinese Seamen's Union chairman Yang."</p>

<p>Since Wang Yunwu invented the Four-Corner Code indexing method, it has been easy to learn and use, and has long been adopted by domestic party and government agencies, libraries, schools, and other public and private organizations for managing files and compiling catalogs. Many libraries, publishers, and schools in foreign countries such as the United States, Japan, Batavia, and the Malay Peninsula have also adopted this indexing method. In terms of applications to publications in China, in addition to the dozens of books published by the Commercial Press, the newly compiled Secret Code Telegram of the Ministry of Communications, the Beijing Library Bibliography Index, the Shen Bao's Republic of China New Map Index, and the Kaiming Bookstore's Ci Tong and Twenty-Five Histories Index are also arranged using this indexing method to make it easier for readers to check. It is now learned that the Shanghai Telephone Company's recently compiled and published summer telephone directory has added a Four-Corner Code Index table at the beginning in addition to the original stroke order index to improve user checking efficiency. From now on, telephone users will find it more convenient to check. In addition, there are examples of the Four-Corner Code Indexing Method before the index table, so those who have never learned the method can use it after spending half an hour or an hour.</p>

<p>Jin Akun, a chauffeur (37 years old, from Wuxi) working for Dr. Xia Yingtang on Fangbang Road, was suddenly attacked by four thugs at around 10 PM on the 9th of this month. The thugs broke into Jin's residence upstairs in the garage at 609 Fangbang Road. They initially asked to borrow money but soon pulled out guns and fired four shots. One bullet struck Jin's abdomen, causing him to fall to the ground with injuries. The thugs then fled. His family immediately rushed the injured man to Baolong Hospital for treatment. Unfortunately, the injury was fatal, and he died in the hospital at 3:15 PM the day before yesterday. His body was then sent to the Phalen Road morgue for examination. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court dispatched personnel to confirm the death. His family then transported the body back to his home on Fangbang Road to prepare for the funeral. The Laobeimen police station learned of this and immediately ordered Jiang Pingyang, the chief of the ninth district, to report to the local court for an autopsy. As the court was preparing for the examination based on the report, Jin Gu's wife suddenly submitted a petition to the court stating that she was 31 years old and from Wuxi, and had two sons and two daughters. Her husband, Jin Akun, was brutally murdered by gunshot. She requested to waive the autopsy, would voluntarily inspect the body, and asked for the arrest and punishment of the murderers to avenge the deceased.

<p>Xu Huaixi, 49 years old, from Xizhuang Village, Fushan County, Shandong Province, learned Western gold and silver jewelry craftsmanship in Lushunkou as a child. In 1918, he established the Taixi Gold Store in Harbin and also served as the director of the Shengjin Department of the Maoye Bank, making a considerable profit. In 1919, through a friend's introduction, he met Luo Yuzhang, also known as Luo Lianzhen, a prostitute from Hunan Province, 35 years old, at the Jinsheng Bookstore in Pingkangli, Daowai, Harbin. At that time, Luo suffered from an eye disease, and Xu hired a doctor to treat her until she recovered. Luo was moved to tears and vowed to serve him with her body. Xu then spent 800 yuan to redeem Luo's freedom. The two then lived together. At that time, Xu had saved 4,600 taels of gold, which he remitted to the Jiufu Gonghang and Gongheli firm in Shanghai. Later, because Harbin declined, Xu and Luo traveled to Shanghai by boat to seek a livelihood. At this time, it was after the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, and the market was sluggish and there was no work to be found. Xu then discussed with Luo and they each returned to their hometowns to visit relatives, agreeing to meet in Shanghai again to make further plans. In 1933, Luo came to Shanghai from Hunan and went to the Tongshang Hotel on Beinicheng Bridge in the British Concession alone. At the same time, she wrote a letter to Xu, urging him to come to Shanghai. At this time, Xu happened to be ill and could not come to Shanghai as scheduled. He cursed to know that Luo eventually, due to her fickle nature, had an affair with Lu, an employee of the Tongshang Hotel. When Xu recovered from his illness and came to Shanghai, Luo's attitude had changed and she avoided meeting him. After Xu searched and visited in every way, he finally met her. Luo immediately spoke sweetly, claiming that someone was sowing discord and that it was a misunderstanding. From now on, she would never be unfaithful. Xu was deceived and deeply believed it to be true, and they resumed living together at No. 10 Jingyi Lane, Zhengjia Muqiao Street in the French Concession. After nearly five months, Luo Yuzhang suddenly claimed that the money deposited in the Gongheli firm, including interest, had reached 9,700 yuan. It would be better to withdraw it and deposit it in the Jiaotong Bank, which would be more secure. Xu believed her and withdrew the money in full and handed it over to Luo for safekeeping. Afterwards, when he asked Luo whether the money had been deposited in the bank, Luo kept prevaricating. After the two lived together for ten months, Luo developed bad intentions and stole her clothes, jewelry, important items, and savings book, fleeing without a trace. Xu immediately reported it to the French police, but they were not able to catch her. Xu had no choice but to file a self-complaint for theft against Luo with the Criminal Court of the Second Branch. The day before yesterday, the court summoned Luo, who sent lawyer Zhao Zuwei to represent her. Zhao said that the defendant had left Shanghai for other places, so the trial was suspended. Luo, on the afternoon of that day at about 5 p.m., went to the lawyer's office in Yongye Lane, Baike Road, to inquire about the progress of the trial. She was found out by Xu, who immediately reported to the French police. Detectives from the French police and the Public Concession police went to the entrance of Yongye Lane on Baike Road and arrested Luo. They then went to Luo's residence at No. 14 Pushou Lane, Ai'erjin Road, and confiscated the stolen gold and silver jewelry, savings book, and other stolen goods, bringing them back to the French police station for detention. Yesterday, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Branch. The police lawyer Yao Zhao and others requested a postponement of the investigation and requested that the lawsuit be handled. Then, according to the plaintiff Xu Huaixi's complaint about the defendant's escape, Luo Yuzhang was questioned. Luo confessed that the jewelry was all owned by the woman herself. She stammered about the rest. She also hired a lawyer to defend her. After Judge Shu Chang verified the confession, he ordered that the hearing be postponed to the 20th for further investigation. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>

<p>The Kaohsiung District National Products Exhibition, which was actively prepared by the Shanghai Student National Products Promotion Federation Annual Meeting, was originally scheduled to open on the 15th of this month. However, due to insufficient preparation on the part of the participating manufacturers, it has been requested to postpone the exhibition. The meeting has decided to reschedule the opening to the 22nd of this month. National products manufacturers who wish to participate can still register at the association's office at 80 Hualong Road. The stall fee is only ten yuan, which is cheaper than any other exhibition. In addition, the exhibition will invite Xu Rongruo, Wang Hanqiang, Ma Jisheng, Xu Lingyun, Hai Ruo, and others from the national products industry to be on the preparatory committee. Furthermore, the principal of Kaohsiung Elementary School, Su Shude, and Wang Kuiheng from the Rural Improvement Association will do their best to assist. It is expected that the results will be sensational. It is also learned that the association's membership solicitation drive, which began on the [blank] day, has been very successful since special commissioners were hired and dispatched to various districts to serve as team leaders. All the team leaders are working hard to solicit members, and some have already reported their scores.

<p>Chen Yipeizhen, a concubine of the late property merchant Chen Yide from Suzhou, who resided at No. 2, Jiusi Lane, Pushi Road, in the French Concession, has hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the Civil Court of the Special No. 2 District Court, accusing Chen Zhou, the main wife of Chen (who resided at No. 260, Baylor Road), and requesting a judgment to return her biological son, Xiong Guan, i.e., Nengyi. The defendant also hired a lawyer to deny that the plaintiff was the concubine of the deceased husband and that the son was her own biological child. A hearing has been held to question the various parties, as reported in this newspaper. The case was heard again yesterday by Judge Ma Yishu of the Special No. 2 District Court in Civil Division 7. Both parties and their lawyers appeared in court. First, the plaintiff, Chen Yipeizhen, stated that the defendant, Chen Zhou, had never given birth to a boy and that Xiong Guan was actually her biological child. Witnesses are present and a request was made for them to be questioned. The judge asked the defendant, Chen Zhou, why she still had not brought the child. Zhou stated that Tai Guan was indeed her own biological child, but he was young and timid and afraid of coming to court. She feared he would be frightened. Therefore, she did not bring him. At this point, the court ordered Dr. He Cuizhen, the obstetrician presented by the plaintiff, to be questioned. Dr. He testified that she had delivered the baby for Yipeizhen ten years ago, on July 21st of the 15th year of the Republic of China. Mr. Chen was not at home when the baby was born. Chen only arrived after the delivery was complete, etc. At this time, the plaintiff's lawyer presented a photograph, stating that the plaintiff in this case was the goddaughter of the defendant's lawyer. The photograph was taken by the wife of the defendant's lawyer. The third person on the right is the plaintiff, which is sufficient to prove that the defendant's lawyer is also deeply aware of the situation of the two parties. After the judge passed this photograph to the defendant's lawyer, Pan Chenge, to review, Lawyer Pan stood up and said that the photograph was genuine. Since the plaintiff has raised this point, the defense lawyer also has something to say. The plaintiff was originally the concubine of Wang Laowu, the owner of the Wang Ruiyu Tea Merchant in Suzhou. When this lawyer was a member of parliament in Beijing, Chen Yide accompanied the plaintiff to my place in Beijing. Chen suffered a wrongful criminal injustice and was sentenced to a long prison term after two trials. He invited me to defend him. I handled the appeal to the Supreme Court, which sent it back for retrial. He was then declared innocent. At that time, I did not charge him any legal fees. Chen and the plaintiff recognized me as their adoptive father. At that time, my son was a technician in the Ministry of Communications, and Chen and my son exchanged cards. Since then, the two sides have been in contact, and the plaintiff took a photo with my family, etc. After this questioning, the court considered that it was necessary to adopt a scientific method of examination to determine who Xiong Guan was born to. Therefore, it was ordered that both the plaintiff and the defendant, together with the child Xiong Guan, report to the court at 2:30 PM tomorrow (i.e., today), where bailiffs will be dispatched to accompany them to the Zhenru Forensic Institute to test their blood. The hearing will be adjourned to a later date. Upon hearing the order, the defendant Chen Zhou said to the court with tears in her eyes, "My child is my own biological child. He is unwilling to come to court. What if he gets frightened?" The judge instructed them to come to the court tomorrow and then go to your home to bring Xiong Guan to Zhenru for testing. Both lawyers were also instructed to clearly explain the matter to their clients. After the instruction, the court adjourned.</p>

Next year's funding, excluding compulsory education, has been slightly reduced compared to this year.</p>
<p>Compulsory Education Funding - A Significant Amount</p>
<p>The central government has approved 1.4 million [currency unit unclear] for compulsory education funding next year, and 500,000 [currency unit unclear] has been decided for border region education funding.

<p>Central Research Institute and others sell at half price</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 13th) The Ministry of Education ordered all departments and bureaus, as well as the Northeast Youth Education Relief Office, stating that the National Central Research Institute's Physics Institute's official letter roughly stated: In view of the need for domestic secondary schools to improve instrument equipment standards, the Institute has expanded the attached instrument factory to meet instrument needs outside the Institute with a portion of personnel and economy. Recently, the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board of Trustees, which is responsible for cultural foundations and management, jointly decided to customize 100 sets of high school physics experiment instruments from the Institute, with a cost of 600 yuan per set, and to offer them to various levels of secondary schools in the country at half price (300 yuan per set) at its discretion. The method will be determined and announced by the two boards of trustees. The number of schools allocated is approximately one-fifth of the number of high schools nationwide. It is proposed to instruct the education departments of various provinces to order all public and private senior high schools that need to increase physics experimental equipment to submit reports to the department through the department, and then to the institute for customization. If the number of sets exceeds 100, the price per set can be reduced to 600 yuan. All instructions and price lists have been directly sent to various senior high schools, etc. With this approval, the department is instructed to immediately instruct all senior high schools to comply.</p>

Later, due to the Ministry of Education's circular ordering provinces and cities to organize elementary education research associations at all levels, the City Education Bureau reorganized the former primary school education research association into the city's elementary education research association. Recently, the Ministry's various questions were divided into groups for preliminary research, and expert members were hired by the Education Bureau to assist in the review and submit them to today's general assembly for detailed discussion. As for the discussion method, due to the large number of issues, it would take a lot of time. To save time, there should not be too many restrictions on speakers. If there are no objections, the original plan based on the review will be passed.</p>
<p>Expert Opinions</p>
<p>Next, experts were invited to express their opinions: (1) Chen Heqin said that today is for research results and general review. The chairmen of each group should first report on the initial research situation and then be reviewed and approved by the general assembly. (2) Dong Renjian said that there should be a standard for reviewing various education reports, and then reviewing them would be more convenient. (3) Shen Baiying said that the research opinions on curriculum and administration should be explained item by item. The issues of teaching equipment are trivial and time-consuming. If there are no special intentions, they should be generally approved. If necessary, a committee should be organized.</p>
<p>Group Reports</p>
<p>After the experts expressed their opinions, each group began to report. (1) Shen Baiying reported on the research situation of the curriculum group. (2) Lu reported on the research situation of the teaching group. (3) Xu Shushen reported on the research situation of the equipment group. (4) Sheng Zhensheng reported on the research situation of the educational administration group.</p>

Recently, many people have been registering, and the enthusiasm is very high. The situation is recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Personnel Appointed</p>
<p>In order to thoroughly implement the purpose of the camp with a large number of children, it is believed that it is not enough to have hygiene education experts preside over everything in order to achieve significant results.

<p>— (Lan Shan)</p>
<p>A fortune teller warned a young man, "You will have love affairs at the age of seventeen. This is not a good thing. You must be careful every step of the way and never try it. If the emperor has love affairs, he will abandon the beautiful country. If robbers pick flowers, they will definitely be caught. If ordinary people have love affairs, they will be confused, muddleheaded, and lose their minds. You must never try it."</p>
<p>People in Shanghai call girls "gua lao," which is a transliteration of the English word "Girl," but it is very interesting. For example, when you have good luck, are rich, and have power, why wouldn't they "gua lao" with you? When your "luck goes and thunder strikes the monument of happiness," even if you try hard, you can't "gua lao" with them.</p>
<p>Ginseng and cinnamon are precious medicines, but they only treat diseases and cannot prolong your life. If taking ginseng could lead to immortality, then all the emperors, wealthy merchants, and big businessmen of ancient and modern times would not die. If you understand this point, those who don't have ginseng to take can be at peace.</p>

<p>— Mustard Seed</p>
<p>Peach Blossom River is a haven for beauties. This folk song has been popular in Shanghai for a long time, but where is this Peach Blossom River, known for producing beauties? I have a friend from Hunan, Mr. Liang, who told me that this river is in Yiyang, Hunan.</p>
<p>Yiyang is an important place on the shores of Dongting and Xiang, and the tea, rice, bamboo, and wood from the Zi River basin are all transferred and exported from here, so the area is exceptionally rich. There is a Wei Mountain southwest of Yiyang, and the Peach Blossom River originates from here. It winds for more than 50 li and flows into the Zi River. The mountains embrace green snails, and the water ripples with emerald jade. The scenery along the banks is extremely serene. In March every year, the peach blossoms bloom, and the banks are like fire and rosy clouds. The petals fall on the river, reflecting the river water into a pink color. It is no wonder that beautiful girls are produced along the river because of its spiritual energy. Mr. Liang said, "There is a saying in Hunan: 'Changsha clogs, Xiangtan umbrellas, Yiyang girls are worth choosing.'" It can be seen that the beauties on the Peach Blossom River are truly worthy of their name.</p>
<p>Whenever the weather is sunny and breezy, there are countless small boats on the Peach Blossom River, coming and going on the water. The people paddling are all dressed in colorful clothes, and they sing in the middle of the river from time to time, which makes the tourists yearn for it. Peach Blossom River, Peach Blossom River, it is truly a fairyland on earth.</p>

<p>— Shen Qin</p>
<p>It is morning. The people on Wangping Street, the people in short clothes, are surging like the tide, coming! Going! They are busy, busy.</p>
<p>Among them are big newspaper vendors, small newspaper vendors, the wives of newspaper vendors, and children selling pancakes and fried dough sticks, braving the cold morning wind, barely propping up their tired bodies and bitter faces, passing through, grabbing the large bundles of newspapers thrown down from the newspaper office's cars, shouting as if hungry people were grabbing bread, vying for them. In a short time, the bundles were piled up on the sidewalk, then divided into small stacks, and then from small stacks into posts. Some grabbed them and stuffed them into their bags, hung them on their shoulders, and scattered to the east, south, west, and north, shouting: "Shen Bao, Xinwen Bao? Shishi Xinbao is here?"; some tied them to their bicycles, "Ding Ling Ling," and rushed out of Wangping Street like flying.</p>
<p>The sun scattered red light in the palace. The nearby time bell struck nine, Wangping Street, leaving some small waves, the big newspaper vendor with a pencil behind his ear, squatting on the ground, the abacus beads clicking, the head nodding again and again</p>
<p>This morning is like this, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow... Every morning is like this, the tide of people in short clothes, surging, - -</p>

<p>— Wave Light</p>
<p>Young man, you mustn't marry that kind of country woman, don't be angry when I say that! Although you are a man, you are not as free as I am, a woman. Miss Wang Xiaoru said this to Mr. Chun.</p>
<p>Mr. Chun is a sentimental writer. All his works are scattered in various newspapers in Shanghai, especially in S Town. Today, he suddenly heard Miss Wang say this, and he felt ashamed and indignant. He felt a burning pain in his heart.</p>
<p>Sleeping in bed at night, quietly savoring the words that Miss Wang said during the day: Is a country woman really not worthy to be my wife? Her face is still acceptable, but her feet are too ugly! She doesn't understand understanding, doesn't have a passionate attitude towards her husband, and is illiterate! This is her shortcoming! Mr. Chun thought of this and felt that the joy of life had disappeared from now on! Two lines of hot tears welled up in his eyes.</p>
<p>She heard her husband sob in his sleep. She thought he was having a nightmare, and she called out twice, "Chun! Chun!" Mr. Chun's sorrow changed again. Although she is a country woman, she is responsible for raising her children, she is thrifty with money, and she doesn't have romantic behavior. If he married a city woman, she would ask for this and that from her husband, which would be painful enough, right? Her husband is a poor wretch, and she can't live in poverty. Maybe she will get a divorce</p>
<p>Miss Wang's words were because she was too jealous, so she said such provocative words. But country women and city ladies really have their own advantages.</p>

<p>Pretending to cry to others, knowing that there is nothing more unhumorous than this, so I imitate Mr. Yingdai to make a joke.</p>
<p>A number of witty sayings, pretending to be bitter and smiling, to relieve boredom.</p>
<p>Girl A: Recently, several stinky men have been following behind me like groupies. What do you think is a good way to avoid them?</p>
<p>Girl B: That's easy, just follow behind them.</p>
<p>Mother: I want to give you six copper coins, but I think that's too much. I want to give you four, but I think that's too little. Can you help me figure out how much money I should give you?</p>

<p>— Wan</p>
<p>The study of translation has indeed improved now. Simple transliterations like "Ji Li, Lanxi," etc., and adding a "mouth" radical to indicate that it is a transliterated word, will no longer exist. In modern essays, many transliterated words are very fresh and meaningful! Let's take a few of the most common ones as examples. For example, "Fiance'e" in English means "fiancée." There is a transliteration that is read as "fei yang san" (廢陽傘), which means "useless umbrella." A useless umbrella is something that only has the name of an umbrella but cannot block the sun or rain. The usefulness of a fiancée is equivalent to a useless umbrella. This transliteration is very accurate. "Husband" in English means "husband." The current popular transliteration is "hei qi ban deng" (黑漆板凳), which means "black lacquered bench." Of course! Modern wives treat their husbands as benches to sit on and play with under their butts. When they feel that it is not suitable, they can kick him away and replace him with another one to sit on. It's just a little difficult to be a black lacquered bench. "Girl" in English means "girl." The current popular transliteration is read as "gou er" (狗兒), which means "puppy." Comparing a girl to a puppy is a bit inappropriate and somewhat blasphemous to women, but have you ever seen the kind of white terrier puppies that modern women or foreign women lead? It's so beautiful, so soft, so handsome! "Long Kiss" in English means a long, deep kiss. The current popular transliteration is read as "lang ke si" (郎渴死), which means "the man is thirsty to death." These three words are unspeakably wonderful. Readers can understand them beyond the words, so I don't need to explain them in detail.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Fourth Aunt <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Feng</p>
<p>Now fourth aunt is sleeping forever.</p>
<p>Speaking of fourth aunt, I can still remember: a short, fat woman with a dark face and sparse hair on her forehead, almost the same as fourth uncle. This is because she has been married to fourth uncle for fifteen or sixteen years and has given birth to five children, obviously working too hard in childbirth! This is a special mark of educational achievement, and no one can deny it. Speaking of her voice, it was like a Hong Zhong bell, she should not be short-lived, but now she only lived to be thirty-nine years old!</p>
<p>When she was lying stiffly on the coffin lid, the people around her were discussing: two years ago, fourth uncle had just graduated from medical school, although he had a sign, the business was very few, so the household expenses were really a few countable coins. I remember one summer, the health bureau sent fourth uncle to the Peking Union Medical College Hospital for an internship, which was to last three months. Fourth uncle was born a rat and had no food to store for the next day. When he arrived in Peking, the family's livelihood was unsustainable. Fourth aunt asked someone to write letters to urge him, and fourth uncle had no choice but to borrow fifteen yuan a month from his cousin to cope. After the three-month internship was over, fourth uncle was assigned to work in the bureau, and he received a salary of one hundred and twenty or thirty yuan a month. Later, he was hired by a company as a medical consultant, and he could earn about two hundred in total. It's only been two years! Life gradually became abundant, and everyone thought fourth aunt could enjoy happiness, but after the Mid-Autumn Festival last year, she suddenly got hemoptysis, which was very severe. Although her own husband was a doctor, and her husband's friends were also doctors, the needles and medicines were ineffective in the end. Everyone said fourth aunt was a hard-working life!</p>
<p>Everyone was talking about it, no one sympathized with her for being unlucky and unable to enjoy wealth and live a long life together. But fourth aunt was just silent!</p>

<p>Another spectacle is the yellow glazed tiles on the roofs of those large palaces, which reflect a dazzling golden light when they are shrouded in sunlight. Usually, you wouldn't see any wonders when looking at them up close. Now, on the boat, looking across the lake, it looks like a golden glow in the air.</p>
<p>Doesn't the Empress Dowager have two yachts prepared? The one she always rides is called the "Imperial Boat," and the other one may as well be called the "Vice Imperial Boat." Its size and style are roughly the same as the Imperial Boat, but it is not as gorgeous. And the color of the fake tiles on its cabin top is green, which is also to distinguish it from the Imperial Boat. Every time we cruise the lake, all the female officials who are not on duty to attend the Empress Dowager, as well as the lower-ranking people in the palace, all have to ride it, following closely behind the Imperial Boat, about five or six zhang away, protecting it. I don't know whether its interior arrangement and the smoothness of the boat are inferior to the Imperial Boat, because I am always on the Imperial Boat and have never ridden it.</p>
<p>In addition to this "Vice Imperial Boat," there are four small yachts that must also follow the Empress Dowager to the lake every time. Two are in the front, divided into left and right, and follow far behind the Imperial Boat. These are for the palace band to ride on – this is the "fine band," not the annoying "coarse band" used during rituals. — They are about twenty people in total, divided into two small boats.

<p>Zhiqian smiled and said, in this day and age, there are quite a few people as enthusiastic as you are in society. Without such enthusiastic people, there are many things that cannot be done in society. You Rong was even more excited when he said this and kept urging Zhiqian to handle it. He left it in his heart that day and prepared a set of words to wait for Beihai to say. Unexpectedly, Beihai never came to after that day. Zhiqian thought, maybe the soil on the ground wasn't dry and he couldn't come, so he waited. However, even for three days, Beihai still did not come. Zhiqian knew that he was deliberately being angry and felt very sorry in his heart. Since arriving in Shaanxi, this was the person he had been most satisfied with. Unexpectedly, he abandoned the friendship between teacher and student for a casual relationship with a woman. If this matter were to reach his friends' ears, then it would be a joke that he couldn't even tolerate a poor student. Zhiqian pondered, feeling extremely uncomfortable in his heart, but it was not convenient to call Beihai on the phone, fearing that the young man would be impatient and argue on the phone. And the strangest thing was that Miss Zhu had not shown her face in these two days either. He had helped her so much on the rainy day, but she didn't take it to heart? However, it was not convenient to ask, because asking would arouse suspicion. On the third afternoon, when the teahouse waiter came in to make tea, Zhiqian asked him with a very nonchalant look, "Have your matchmakers been successful?" The waiter was first stunned, then remembered and smiled, "Are you talking about that Miss Zhu? That's a joke." (239)</p>

<h3 id="e219">Finance Trading Approaching; Gold Market Lingering Without Honor or Disgrace <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the gold market has seen a lack of activity from major players. Coupled with the approaching trading period, retail investors are also hesitant to speculate excessively, resulting in a dull market with unremarkable supply and demand. Yesterday's market showed initial weakness followed by strength, with overall sentiment remaining neutral, ultimately resulting in a slight increase. In the early morning, overseas silver markets contracted. However, large speculators claimed that after the market closed, Indian and local speculators bought in, causing the market to strengthen, with the final transaction price higher at 625.  Mondelay forward silver prices fell slightly. Exchange rates opened higher but closed lower. London spot gold fell sharply by one shilling and one penny. News reported that the Minister of Finance responded to silver factions' silver purchases, stating that the existing order would not change. Although this is outdated, it still stimulated the psychology of general retail investors, causing over-the-counter preparatory trading to open with a lack of buyers, falling from over 70 yuan to 67.8 yuan before stabilizing and recovering. The Central Bank's official exchange rates were announced, with the British pound unchanged and the US dollar contracting. Customs gold units fell by one cent. The gold standard price was again lowered to 835 yuan. It was heard that the market remained weak afterward, but stabilized with refined gold, as short sellers moved to cover their positions and major players also came to purchase bars, gradually pulling the market up. The HSBC Bank's official exchange rates were announced, with both British pound and US dollar unchanged. Subsequently, banks hedged the US dollar and broke through the 70 yuan barrier, with supply and demand balancing. Many buy orders appeared, but the increase was limited, and the market was extremely calm, lacking special changes, mainly because the foreign exchange market process was also quiet. Helplessly, major players continued to purchase bars, and floating shorts felt disappointed. At noon, the trend became stronger again, and the after-market continued to be stable. Although there was supply at higher prices, the buying was still strong, and prices rose again. When the report of Indian silver shrinking by one anna and rising by 1.2 annas came, buyers showed some disappointment and prices declined. However, due to limited trading, there was much lingering, and after the second report of Indian silver rising by 4.2.1 annas, people were disappointed and bulls sold off, leading to a decline. Finally, there was a lack of large-scale supply and demand, resulting in a particularly sluggish state. The foreign exchange market also lacked changes. The market situation for the day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening price was 768.5 yuan, down 2 yuan from the previous close. Da Fa, Yongfu, and Xingyong sold off, dropping to 7 yuan and 6 jiao. Fuxing, Yongheng, Yuda Cheng, Hengchang, and Yonglai bought in, favorably hedging July US dollars at 625, rising to 9 yuan and 8 jiao. Fuxing, Yongjia, Runyuan, and Maoyong sold off at higher prices, retreating to 8 yuan and 5 jiao. Anticipating HSBC's exchange rate announcement, the British pound and US dollar were both unchanged.

<p>—The '96' Bonds Remain Strong in the Near Term</p>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Securities Exchange, rumors rose again, and people's hearts weakened. A sharp decline began in the market, with great force and speed. The troop reduction public bonds almost hit the limit in the morning, the atmosphere was tense, and everyone was on edge. Fortunately, major players absorbed them later, so the downward trend slowed, from revenue tax onwards. In the second round, there was a demand, rebounding about 1 yuan, but as a result, it was still down over 1 yuan. The trend and prospects can be expected to rise slightly, but from an environmental perspective, it is still necessary to verify optimism. The 96 public bonds have always been unique. Although the market did not rise sharply yesterday, the trend was very outstanding. Many bulls have organized around the debt, so its market price may eventually rise sharply at some point.

However, in terms of sales, due to tight monetary conditions, it was difficult to see an improvement. Therefore, although urban and rural stores made some purchases, the quantity was small. Moreover, contracted purchases were suddenly suspended. As a result, the prices of various high-quality glutinous rice varieties were stable. Since there was a larger supply of late rice varieties, and sales were weak, prices were slightly lower, by a few cents to nearly a dime. Other varieties such as "Bian Yuan" and "Du Jian," were generally stable. (In the northern Shanghai area) yesterday, seventeen or eighteen shipments arrived from various routes below the river. Sales of all varieties were flat. The market price of white glutinous rice was firm, dry rice was stable, and high-quality "Bai Yuan" rice was slightly lower by a few cents; other varieties were stable.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice: Yesterday, the foreign rice market was initially in a strong position, but it was affected by rumors. Local rice merchants were hesitant to purchase. After continuous active purchases from inland Zhejiang province, demand was still being met. Local demand was limited, and the market showed signs of a sudden decline. Subsequently, Anqing, Hankou, and Jiujiang merchants from Nanjing and the Yangtze River region continued to purchase, and demand was strong. The market gradually recovered. Throughout the day, 10,000 bags of Saigon No. 1 and broken rice were sold, and 5,700 bags of small-grain rice were sold. It is said that the market will stabilize again.</p>
<h3 id="e229">Dalian Soybeans Dumped at Low Prices <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Dalian soybeans were dumped at low prices, and soybeans from the Jinpu and Longhai railways were squeezed out. In the market, only over ninety bags of top-grade "Quan He" soybeans were sold; there were no other transactions. The spot price of Dalian Siping Street soybeans fell from 3.55 yuan to 50 cents, with three cars sold, mainly to local retailers. Factories bought seventeen cars of soybeans for delivery at the end of June in Siping Street at a price that fell from 3.45 yuan to 3.42 yuan. The downward trend is expected to continue. The remaining transactions included one hundred bags of Xicheng soybeans at 3.58 yuan, one hundred bags of Niuzhuang Bai Mei soybeans at 3.85 yuan, and one hundred and eighty bags of Andong soybeans at 3.85 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Sugar Market: Refined White Sugar Opens Lower by One Dime <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a decline in the customs gold standard, resulting in few purchases. The trend was weak and difficult to reverse. The association quoted 16.10 yuan per picul for spot raw coarse granulated white sugar, unchanged. Re-exported goods were quoted at 5.10 yuan, down by five cents, with few transactions. Taikoo Sugar B mark was quoted at 17.40 yuan, with no buyers. Refined white sugar from the Zhenyu brand opened lower by one dime at 15.40 yuan for No. 1, 15.30 yuan for No. 2, 15.15 yuan for No. 3, and 15.00 yuan for No. 4. The B brand was quoted at 20.40 yuan for No. 1 and 20.30 yuan for No. 2, down by one or two dimes. Only a few dozen bags of low-grade brown sugar from domestic sources were offered at 10 yuan, with few other transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e231">North-South Goods: Over Two Thousand Bags of Raw Peanuts Offered <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>Raw peanuts have been weak for days because of slow sales in Guangdong. The market continues to decline. Guangdong merchants are now purchasing and selling rapeseed because this year's rapeseed harvest was plentiful and the price was cheap. Therefore, it is more difficult for raw peanuts to recover. Yesterday, a local oil factory considered current prices to be more favorable and purchased a batch of ordinary Tancheng peanuts, totaling over one thousand bags, at 6.30 yuan, down by one or two dimes.</p>
<h3 id="e232">Piece Goods: Western Tribute Cloth Already Affected <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>"Yuan Qing" tribute cloth, a popular item, sells year-round. The shoe industry is the largest customer. Recently, however, the selling price has also fallen. The reasons are: (1) new goods are cheaper due to exchange rate conditions; (2) the "Rong Tai" tribute cloth standard has collapsed, and various brands are flooding the market; (3) it is affected by the cheap dumping of Japanese "Yuan Zhi" tribute cloth and the promotion of domestic "Xian Tong Hua" tribute cloth; (4) the weather is extremely hot, sales are slow, and the shoe factories are using less due to the impact of domestic "Da Wu" cloth.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Tunxi high-grade "Zhen Mei" green tea was actively purchased by British firms such as Xiehe, Jinlong, Fushi, and Baochang in response to overseas orders. Trading was brisk, but the opening price was lower by one or two yuan due to the weak negotiating power of Chinese merchants. Both British and Russian firms purchased black tea from Qimen, Fuliang, Ningzhou, and Hekou, and sales were slightly more active. The price of high-quality goods remained stable, but low-grade goods continued to fall by one or two yuan to four or five yuan.</p>

<p>Since two hundred bars of company iron arrived and flooded the market, the market has been sluggish. Since yesterday, inquiries have come from Xi'an, Hankou, and Shantou, so the market situation is no longer what it was, and the market is showing some improvement. For example, American "Gangchang" iron is estimated at 18.50 yuan, and "Xin Gangchang" iron is sold at 27.50 yuan. German iron is estimated at 28 yuan, French iron is estimated at 27 yuan, and Japanese iron is offered at 26 yuan. It is found that a total of one hundred and seventy or eighty boxes were offered, sold by a hardware store on North Suzhou Road. It is found that local business has recently been affected by tight money, so there is still no sign of development.</p>

<p>Since the egg factory group purchased one hundred pound double-joint American tinplate, stocks have been depleted, and since the cargo made after January has been shipped out, there has been no definite shipment since then, and the standard is therefore firm, estimated at 34.50 yuan per box, an increase of 5 dimes from before. It is heard that the iron factory group has continued to purchase recently, so the market is good.</p>

<h3 id="e239">Essays and Random Notes <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Wen</p>
<p>Generally speaking, "random notes" are just one type of "essay." Besides random notes, what other types of essays are there? The most common are "various thoughts" and "various talks." Roughly speaking, random notes focus on narration, various thoughts focus on discussion, and various talks give equal weight to narration and discussion; random notes emphasize expressing emotions, while various thoughts and various talks emphasize reasoning. – But this is specifically in the realm of essays. When comparing them to novels, there is no need for such distinctions.</p>
<p>Novels require a "structure." Although after successful writing, it seems like it was a normal occurrence, simply written down as is. In fact, the subjects used in "expressive novels" are rarely true events. Eight or nine out of ten are fictional; this requires a lot of mental effort from the author. From "capturing the artistic conception" to actually writing, a "mental draft" is necessary, requiring a lot of consideration. It must go through several revisions to be completed.</p>
<p>In order to achieve "artistic intent," to make it "simple," and to write it "naturally," writing a novel is like playing with "tangrams." "Moving one piece requires moving all the pieces, and you can't focus on one thing and lose sight of the others." Therefore, from capturing the artistic conception to finishing the writing, it always takes a lot of time. After having an artistic conception, there may not be a suitable way to express it. After deciding on a way, it is necessary to examine whether it is appropriate and whether there are any conflicts.</p>
<p>My own experience: when creating a novel of more than five thousand words, after capturing the artistic conception, I always specifically go for a walk outside several times. Sometimes I deliberately go to a quiet place to walk alone, and sometimes I deliberately go to a busy street to run around, in order to carefully experience and explore the facts from the perspective of the characters. For works with over 30,000 words, I often go on a long journey before actually starting to write. – Although</p>
<p>it is not possible to travel specifically for the sake of creation, those who rely on wandering for food and clothing can easily take advantage of natural opportunities. Under the broad and empty moonlight, in the turbulent rapids, standing on a high mountain, or confined in a small room, the moods are different, and the feelings are different. In extraordinary situations, the senses become very sharp, and emotions are particularly rich. Therefore, some errors that are usually unthinkable can be suddenly realized at this time; and some advantages that are usually impossible to explore can also be suddenly felt at this time.</p>
<p>From the above, it can be seen that making a good novel is really not easy, at least it is very time-consuming. Essays are not like this. Once you think of something, you can start writing right away. This is not intentionally rough. There is no need to construct, no need to correspond. You can just write freely according to your feelings. Moreover, the length is short. Even if you want the beginning and end to match, a few words are enough. It is not difficult to complete it in one go.</p>
<p>With essays, you can pick up a pen and start writing as soon as you have thoughts. You can write anytime, anywhere. You can write one in a couple of hours, and you can write two or three in three or four hours. Writing as you feel is extremely casual! Compared to novels, plays are also like this, really very casual! – Some people also call various thoughts "random thoughts" or "records of random thoughts"; various talks are also called "random notes"; then wouldn't it be perfectly fine to just call all essays "random notes"?</p>
<h3 id="e240">Farewell to the Mountain City <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Shengshi</p>
<p>Living on a mountain should be very quiet, but it is not quiet here at all. It seems so noisy that it is annoying.</p>
<p>Originally, the house on the mountain was not my villa. Enjoying the peaceful life of living in the mountains is certainly not something a "merchant of knowledge who goes to the mountain to teach for a living" can yearn for.</p>
<p>Time flies by so quickly. Having this feeling certainly counts as happiness. For a beggar lying sick under a hillside, time probably feels very difficult to get through.</p>
<p>I have been living on the mountain for half a year: when I came from Jiangnan, I was still wearing leather and a scarf. But in the blink of an eye, deep winter is over, and the spring in Jiangnan has also aged in my dreams.</p>
<p>I have put away my leather coats, cotton robes, and lined jackets. I am wearing thin clothes. It is already early summer. Looking at the pomegranate trees planted all over the hillside, they are burning into a sea of pomegranate fire under the scorching sun.</p>
<p>Under the window of the small building where I live, there is a street where some poor families live. There is always a chance to hear them quarreling or beating their children. A fat man with a Yangzhou accent stands there with his legs spread apart outside the small gate opposite my window every day. When it gets hot, he goes shirtless all day. His body is so fat that it is really annoying, especially that big belly that looks like a big drum. I always suspect that such a big belly must have some kind of disease! But he doesn't care at all. He himself doesn't find it annoying that his body is so fleshy that it makes him suffer. I see him standing at the gate every day with a smug look. I have never seen him do any work, and at the same time, I think that it would be inconvenient for him to work! Just his figure alone is enough to exhaust him.</p>
<p>After leaving the mountain city, this fat man will forever remain in my memory as annoying! He doesn't do a bit of work and chats nonsense with familiar neighbors or peddlers buying things under my window all day long. I really hate his heavy voice. When he opens his mouth, it sounds like chopping a big bamboo tube.</p>
<p>Behind the mountain, there are two small schools. Every day, elementary school students pass by here noisily.</p>
<p>From early morning to sunset, many beggars walk past under my window, crying. Some crawl, and those without hands and feet roll past with a section of their bodies.</p>
<p>All kinds of noisy sounds constantly drift past my window.</p>
<p>Life in the mountains is not at all relaxing and cheerful.</p>
<p>I want to write a few articles on the mountain and read some books that I usually want to read, but I can't have a peaceful mind at all.</p>
<p>I can't explain it to myself. Almost everywhere I go, I can't find a place that satisfies me.</p>
<p>I want to leave this place. Summer vacation is approaching. Let me pat off the dust from the mountain wind that has accumulated on my body for half a year, wave my hand, and return to Jiangnan.</p>
<p>Farewell! Small mountain city! Huaiyuan.</p>

<p>— Yao Mu</p>
<p>—Travel Notes of a World-Weary Traveler, Part Three—</p>
<p>Friend:</p>
<p>In the early evening, when the lights are bright, I ran to Beijing again. Speaking of Beijing, friend, you remember, don't you, the lover-like Beijing, you introduced me to her, and since then I have lived in Beijing for four or five years. There, I also endured poverty, ate cornbread, felt nervous, struggled, like a fugitive, but the most comfortable and sweet family life in my life was also spent in Beijing. Beijing is an aging beauty, whose past grace and charm are still hidden in her eyebrows and dimples. In her arms, you forget her age and haggardness, and from her consideration, you feel her solemnity. When you leave her, can you not constantly miss her?</p>
<p>When I traveled north the year before last, I lingered in Beijing for several days, but it didn't seem like enough. This trip to Beijing was originally outside the itinerary, but I finally circled back, planning to stay in Beijing and then go to Tianjin. Leaving the station, I jumped into a rickshaw with two bright lights and told the driver to go to the hotel on East Chang'an Street. The rickshaw followed the usual route, passing through the stone slab alley from Tiananmen to Qianmen, passing the dark and majestic Qianmen tower, and heading to Dongjiaomin Lane. Dongjiaomin Lane was still deserted at night. Although it was early summer, the night breeze was still as chilly as a spring night. The clean streets and the neat, oriental-style buildings on both</p>
<p>sides made the place seem even more secluded. Sparse streetlights hung high from the center of the street. The lights were not very bright, and the places a little further away from the lights were even darker. Cool breezes blew in gusts, the lights swayed, and the locust trees on both sides of the street rustled. The shadows of the trees moved slightly on the walls and the ground. My rickshaw, the driver, and my shadow swept past the shadows of the trees on the walls one by one. There were almost no pedestrians on the street, only two or three rickshaws sped past. The bored patrolmen stood blankly at the street corners. The two guards in front of the tall, monstrous-looking embassy doors carried their guns and walked back and forth. The sounds of their footsteps could not break the silence of the night. But suddenly, memories mixed with terror flooded my mind. I remembered that I was not walking on a shady path for lovers to whisper on, but in the devil's lair that had been stained with the blood of the brave...</p>
<p>Leaving Dongjiaomin Lane, there was the broad and tree-lined East Chang'an Street. In the hazy night, this most beautiful street in China seemed even more quiet and gentle.</p>
<p>The hotel I entered, friend, was exactly the hotel where I stayed with you the first time I came to Beijing. The old waiter served me with a familiar smile. After washing my face, I walked out of the hotel and slowly walked towards Dong'an Market. It was only about nine o'clock, and the pedestrians on Wangfujing Street were already very sparse. Some of the shops had closed their doors, and the newly added neon signs coldly illuminated the street. I stepped step by step on the sidewalk made of fine bricks that I used to walk almost every day, immersed in past memories. Entering through the south gate of Dong'an Market, I looked around. The stalls selling fruits and groceries seemed a little sparser than before. I passed through the Danggui Commercial Building, which was full of book stalls, and then turned to the main street of the market. The layout and people of the book stalls were almost the same as before, but the familiar faces that used to greet me no longer recognized me. At the north end of the main street, the stalls displaying brightly colored fruits and sugar gourds, and the glass covers filled with piles of golden, oily spiced pigeons, soy sauce chicken, and the like still had a tempting power, but the customers here, like those at the book stalls, were few and far between. Even the peddlers were too lazy to ring their bells. "Why is it so desolate?" I couldn't help but wonder.</p>
<p>Walking out of the market, a few drops of cool rain fell sparsely. The pedestrians on the street became even more sparse, and the scene was even more desolate. I suppressed my inexplicable melancholy and hurried back to the hotel.</p>
<p>The hotel was also unusually quiet. If it weren't for the modern furnishings, I would probably feel like I was in an ancient inn on a remote road. Under the caress of the quietness, countless memories surged, propping up my tired eyes. I thought of my Beijing life of several years, from hardship to comfort. I thought of my wife and children, who were thousands of miles away and missed me. I thought of the old friends in Beijing, who were close at hand but I didn't want to see this time. I thought of you, the person who introduced me to Beijing and left a deep mark on my life... The future struggles and hardships, although I hadn't thought about them yet, these surging whirlpools were enough to make me fall asleep very late, and I had many strange and bizarre dreams, and woke up very early the next morning.</p>
<p>When I got up, there were still two hours before the train to Tianjin left. I remembered that this was the season for peonies, and the Central Park could be</p>
<p>walked, so I settled the hotel bill, took my only luggage—a small suitcase, and took a tram to the park, planning to get off there and go straight to the station. You would probably laugh when you heard how attached I am to Beijing, right?</p>
<p>Going west from Laijin Yuxuan to the vicinity of the waterside pavilion, all I could see were peony flower gardens, snow-white, pink, light red, deep purple, each with its own classical name; but after the destruction of days of strong winds, the season of decline had arrived prematurely, and most of the flowers had lost their color. It was still drizzling, adding to the melancholy.</p>
<p>The tall wisteria frames next to the flower gardens were also bearing heavy racemes, but the color was no longer the vibrant deep purple like violets, but a purple mixed with gray and white. If Beijing is really like an aging beauty, I think the wisteria is the most appropriate symbol of Beijing. Pink and white wisteria sheds.</p>
<p>The vermilion and grass-green winding corridors, as new as ever, I followed the corridors to the area where the teahouse was located. I remembered that the corridors were my favorite place to walk. Besides swinging in the children's playground in the park, my children liked to skate on the slippery ground of these corridors. Friend, you even took a picture of him here once, didn't you? I also remembered that when they lived in Beijing, Central Park was where our family spent half a day. Now, I can only wander here alone for a moment. However, "something is better than nothing," I can use this to mock and comfort myself. (The End)</p>
<h3 id="e242">The Owner of the Knocking Brick <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Zong Ge</p>
<p>I saw Mr. Yao Xueyin's article "The Special Use of Literature" in the June 5th issue of Free Talk. "The so-called special use," said Mr. Yao, "is to use literature as a knocking brick." This phenomenon, as Mr. Yao said, is common. However, "the little advantage gained by those who speculate will only be like morning dew, and will never last long." This is what poor literary youths do. I think Mr. Yao has overlooked many other people; some special leisured people; those who will always use literature as a brick to knock on doors! Moreover, in fact, some of the poor youths that Mr. Yao spoke of want to make literature their lifelong career.</p>
<p>We believe that it is not the poor youths who use literature as a stepping stone. For example, in the examples cited by Mr. Yao, running a publication, seeking inscriptions from celebrities, writing prefaces, and asking friends to write book reviews, etc., these are not things that ordinary literary youths can do. And they are not needed either.</p>
<p>Some so-called writers, like certain lyricists, certain poets, etc., have a lot of money at home and don't need to worry about tomorrow's livelihood," and have the leisure to open bookstores, run publications, publish books, and write prefaces for friends' works, etc. What they need is reputation, like the "donation of official positions" in the past. Conversely, poor youths can only dedicate their lives to literature, enrich their lives, and master their skills. Although most of what they get is bounced back, they are not discouraged. These young people who write while eating have no money to run publications – and others don't let them run them either – and they don't know any famous students, so where can they find someone to write inscriptions (or prefaces)? I remember that someone wrote a book, and the cover was from a famous painter, and the inscription was from a famous saying. But can poor youths do that?</p>
<p>Furthermore, deceiving women, getting promoted, and making money after becoming famous are even more out of reach for poor literary youths.</p>
<p>Because there are some women who can be approached without using collections or magazines! As for becoming officials? They can only be clerks, until they die. Making money? It seems that literary youths can only dream of winning the aviation lottery!</p>
<p>Of course, I am not saying that there is no one who uses literature as a brick, but this is what those special leisured people that Mr. Yao did not talk about do – because what they need is only to use it as a brick, just to knock open the door. After entering the literary world, they don't care whether the brick disappears like morning dew, or is borrowed by someone else to become an official or deceive women. They don't care. As long as they already have women to play with and have become officials, it doesn't matter whether the brick remains permanent or not. – At most, they will take it as a "souvenir" or "gift to Mr. and Mrs. ××"!</p>
<p>Literary youths should use literature as a career, that's for sure, right? However, using it as a knocking brick is done by a small number of pretentious people, and not by those who are truly aspiring literary youths.</p>

<p>— Written by German author Storm, translated by Chen Yin</p>
<p>'Look, the dancing shoes have been placed there already!' Fritz said. 'Could Mr. Bolika also be a shoemaker?'</p>
<p>The woman shook her head. 'You know, Fritz, unfortunately, he is a polymath! Next spring, he will even fix your dull watch for you! This shoe was made by him as a Christmas gift for the child and is already done.'</p>
<p>'Then, Margaret, my mother has a large box of good-looking old clothes that you can take and alter for Nellie to wear; each one is enough to make at least three pieces for her!'</p>
<p>The old woman laughed; but she put on a serious face, 'I don't know,' she said, 'that is also not possible; but if the mayor's wife is willing...'</p>
<p>At this moment, the little girl came in again and stood next to her mother. She had changed into a white collar, which did not escape my notice; and I also noticed that the pair of earrings with red coral beads was something I hadn't seen just now.</p>
<p>'What do you mean, Nellie?' Fritz said, while the old woman was hesitating and deeply considering this matter, 'Are you willing to go dancing with us?'</p>
<p>She did not answer; but she put her hands around her mother's neck, said something in her mother's ear, and at the same time her face turned redder and redder.</p>
<p>'Fritz!' the old woman said, pushing away the stubborn little girl, 'Why didn't you discuss it with me alone from the beginning? Then there wouldn't be any trouble. Now you have moved the child's heart; I know she won't let me be quiet anymore!' --</p>
<p>They thus gained the victory. 'Wednesday evening at seven o'clock,' Fritz said as he bid farewell; then, the mother and daughter sent them out the door. -- When they had walked a distance and turned their heads, they saw the little girl still standing there, nodding to them several times, and then quickly running back into the house.</p>
<p>Learning to Dance</p>
<p>The next day, according to Fritz's private confession, Mrs. Bolika went to his mother's house and rummaged through the closet with his mother for a while. Then, she left his house with a full package.</p>
<p>Dancing lessons began on Tuesday evening. My pair of worn-out shoes with steel springs and the new clothes were rushed out for me by the shoemaker and tailor at that time; when I walked into the hall, everyone had already gathered there. My classmates stood around the old dance master by the window, and the dance master was pressing the keys of his piano with his fingers, following their wishes. The female dance partners formed a line, arm in arm, walking back and forth.</p>

<h3 id="e244">The Sigh of Being in Chen <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Chen</p>
<p>We used to have a saying: 'Be filial to parents at home, respect teachers and elders when away from home.' This shows that respect for teachers did not begin today. However, in reality, the hardship of the 'chalk career' and the difficulty of sitting on the 'cold bench' have long formed a deeply ingrained fact, especially for primary and secondary school teachers. Around the time we commemorate 'Teachers' Day,' this situation is constantly revealed. First, the principals of various provincial schools in Zhejiang collectively went to the provincial government in early May to petition for the prompt issuance of arrears and that salaries not be discounted. Secondly, Han Guodong, a teacher at Jiangxi Provincial No. 1 Middle School, sought other employment because his teaching life was difficult to maintain, and as a result, he was so deeply stimulated that he hanged himself in the school building. Not long ago, primary school teachers in Guangzhou rioted in demand of their salaries due to the fact that the salaries for May of this year had not been issued at all, which caused the school's cook to stop providing meals, triggering a not-so-small salary demanding storm. Recently, the education sector in Changsha also requested the issuance of all arrears from April and the exemption of mandatory treasury bonds.</p>
<p>These facts illustrate that the 'chalk career' is already extremely difficult, and it is going to be further compounded by months of arrears, discounts, and the thinly-veiled reduction and exploitation through mandatory treasury bonds. With such a precarious livelihood, it is impossible to expect teachers to be content with education, let alone expect them to make achievements in their own careers. The reason is very simple. No matter how hard-working, resilient, or reckless you are, you must at least have food to eat, or else you can't 'work'!</p>
<p>When primary schools in Guangzhou were in the midst of the salary demanding storm, one teacher once said: 'I didn't expect that thousands of years later, the teachers who follow Confucius's teachings would also have the sigh of being in Chen like Confucius. The chalk career tastes like chicken ribs, tasteless to eat and a pity to discard. For the time being, there is no other suitable profession, and to persevere is equivalent to self-grinding. Therefore, in the current environment, it is like entering an old people's home or being sentenced to life imprisonment.' Many of us who want to revitalize the nation through 'nurturing and teaching' are now seeing that the lives of these primary and secondary school teachers, who bear heavy responsibilities, have become like 'entering an old people's home' or 'being sentenced to life imprisonment.' I wonder what kind of feelings they will have.</p>
<h3 id="e245">Souvenir Album <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Mingmang</p>
<p>Unintentionally, I accidentally opened the souvenir album written by my friends from middle school ten years ago, and the past suddenly floated from my mind like a wisp of light smoke. The passage of ten years has indeed been extraordinarily swift, and the changes in human affairs are even more unexpected. A souvenir album pressed in a box followed its owner in travels, drifting east and west, and had long been abandoned beyond the scope of memory, but unexpectedly, in this other relocation, it was unearthed like a buried antique. The cover of the album already appeared a bit old and was covered with a thin layer of dust, but turning through page after page, the smooth pages inside still retained a bit of freshness. What was even more exciting and stirring was that the photos of friends from my youth were still lifelike, and every word seemed to have left behind fresh ink, as if it had just been written yesterday.</p>
<p>It seems that people cannot help but be creatures of nostalgia. When this small album was spread out before my eyes, the ridiculous and lovely life of my youth, or even my childhood, was evoked from the depths of my heart. A lively and unpretentious face emerged one by one from this album, and then I remembered those pure and sincere friendships. How frank, honest, and innocent those friends who still held onto their childlike hearts were; full of vitality like the morning sun, and always looking straight ahead with their backs straightened. How brave and how deeply righteous those people who had not been stained with the grey clothes of society and life were. Relying on their intuition, they lacked the hypocrisy of worldly affairs more than social people, although these young people were scolded by the elderly as 'wild children.' Similarly, although they were not thorough in 'the ways of the world,' they were at the same time more upright and selfless than adults. They made noise, argued, and even fought, but after making noise, they were at peace, or even became closer. They did not engage in intrigue to form a black web of society; nor were they selfish, harming others to enrich themselves. They forgot the past and looked to the future. They held bright hopes for the world, society, the country, and themselves. Without discouragement or lament, they were the most sound and promising roles in composing this world.</p>
<p>However, ten years have passed. This pure and beautiful little group has scattered and broken up as everyone has grown older and their social connections have expanded. For the sake of life, solid friendships have been broken up; for the sake of life, pure and flawless moods have also been stained with grey dots to a greater or lesser extent. The great hopes of the past have been lost; society has shaved off their individuality and eliminated their sense of justice. Even old friends have become enemies, and selfishness has changed the upward nature of mankind. Now, some of these old friends have become social parasites, some have become pot-bellied tycoons, evil gentry, or corrupt officials, while others are destitute, consuming their lives under the giant wheels of society. Some have fallen into smoking opium and becoming drunkards; others have painted their souls with black charcoal or tormented their bodies to this point. Ten years of human affairs have changed into so many patterns, and the passion of the past has only turned into a puff of smoke. Childhood and childlike innocence have been lost, but the growing life has not been replaced by the growing reason to contribute to society and the country the strength that mankind should contribute. Now, this small album is still well-preserved, but into what abyss or what dark devil's cave have those dirty little trivial characters fallen?</p>
<p>This seems a bit unbelievable: a small album has only been dyed with some small dust in ten years, but human affairs have changed faster and more complicatedly than the pages of paper. If this album is kept for another ten, twenty, or even a lifetime, what patterns will these characters become in the future, and what feelings of the past and present will arise? Are people really so fragile and so useless? Is the function of this souvenir album only to evoke feelings? Then I really want to throw this album away!</p>

<h3 id="e246">Sisters-in-Law (Bottom) <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Ling Zixi</p>
<p>'What's suffering is the wife of Changgen, these days, hum! Being tormented and scolded every day, it's not human life! Humph, sinful, sinful!'</p>
<p>The words are correct, Changgen's wife has been living in tears and torment every day since her man died, and she has been rescued from the small river after seeking death two or three times, right?</p>
<p>It was still a distant uncle who acted as matchmaker for Changgen's wife last spring, saying that the woman's family had no one left, only a widowed aunt. They couldn't even provide clothing for her, and they were still willing to let her linger in the house? Therefore, they quickly wanted to give the girl away—not requiring large betrothal gifts, just wanting a good person, spending thirty or fifty yuan would do. Changgen thought this was a 'bargain', so he took advantage of the fact that there was still some harvest in the fields last year and married her!</p>
<p>However, in the summer, because the year was dry, and he had carted water in the scorching sun all summer, he stretched out his legs in a bout of typhoid fever in the autumn and died!</p>
<p>From this time on, Changgen's mother said that she was bad luck, even 'killing' her 'family man'. So she cursed her overtly and covertly; and Changgen's sister, Yaomei, because her sister-in-law's family was penniless, fearing that she would eat up her family's resources and take a share of her family's only seventeen mu of paddy fields; therefore, with the purpose of belittling and dispatching, she also borrowed the excuse of 'bad luck and killing people', and day by day, she tormented Changgen's wife, who had already become a widow.</p>
<p>In this way, the little sister was sharp, and the Changgen's mother in the middle was also a 'sharp-tongued woman'; in this way, day by day, a chasm of bullying, insidious, and acquisitive behavior first opened up between the sisters-in-law; and following this, the deterioration between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law deepened day by day. It is easy to torment a fragile soul that has lost the center of its life. Every day, when vicious words shot out like arrows from the mouths of the little sister and mother-in-law, Changgen's wife always thought silently in tears: 'Living on in this life that is not suitable for life, I will eventually destroy this life.' Finally, one morning, people found that Changgen's wife's body was already floating on the water of the back river, drifting with the waves.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Tired <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>If a family is equivalent to a man's fetters, then I, like many others, have used my own hands to put those fetters around my neck, thereby invisibly eliminating all freedom, even the progressive ambition that young people should have. Now I am only tired of the current pile of dross-like life. I can no longer recall the past with a leisurely thought, and I dare not imagine the future. If there is a little hope, then this hope is simply written on water, written in a vague human dream, because two children and a woman's family have burdened me so much that I can barely make ends meet.</p>
<p>Family is really an unbearable itch! I feel this way all the time. What makes me feel this way is the daily habits that surround me.</p>
<p>I am a person who makes a living by writing, and I must always set aside some time every day to sit at the writing desk and write on paper. When I have fostered a little bit of quiet and comfortable thoughts and plan to start working, just as I sit down at the table, before I even grab the pen, the two children start吵吵吵, the older one snatches a piece of candy from the little brother's mouth, rushes out the door and runs away, so the little brother cries out:</p>
<p>'Mom, the older brother snatched my candy, candy.' While saying this, tears and snot smeared all over his face. When the mother chases up, catches the one who snatched the thing back, but the candy has already been swallowed into his stomach, naturally he will be punished with a couple of slaps. The other one sees his brother being slapped, seems to feel satisfied, immediately stops crying. However, pacifying this one and not pacifying that one, the one who was beaten is crying miserably. And this cry is not easy to stop for a while, it seems that he must cry out all the grievances in his heart until he is completely dry, so it provokes the mother to be even more angry.</p>
<p>'What are you crying for, go die, just a light hit and you are making such a fuss, if you cry again, I will hit you again.' But the child at this time does not care about the majesty of the adults, seeing that the mother has no good words, but instead curses fiercely, then cries even more sadly, so the mother really grabs this disobedient ruffian child, and hits him hard, but just hitting does not subdue the child's wild nature.</p>
<p>—Don't keep hitting like that, you should use good words to talk to the children.</p>
<p>I really couldn't bear to watch it anymore. In this chaotic scene, I still want to be able to do things, I vent my anger on my wife for not handling things properly, causing a small matter to make an irreparable fuss. And at the same time, the wife also turns her anger towards me:</p>
<p>—You only know how to make pretty words, why do you just sit and watch, don't you get up and coax them. The children are not just mine.</p>
<p>—Joke, you want to pick a fight with me for no reason again, what have you been doing all day, even the children can't be disciplined, are you waiting for me to do it, then I don't have to do anything either, you can take care of the children, that's fine, but who is going to eat and drink?</p>
<p>The wife seems to understand the unreasonableness of her own words and actions, lowers her head and quietly walks to the stove room. But in a moment, my grief and indignation could not be suppressed, thinking that such a crude life is simply not human. I simply ran out to relieve boredom outside, at this time I often think of being ruthless and no longer going home, abandoning them, I would rather wander around alone, saving myself from suffering this meaningless pain, but in an instant, I can't bear it, thinking that people can't get rid of this entanglement after all, people must live such a pitiful life after all.</p>
<p>Often it starts with the children吵吵吵, and in the end it is the result of a mutual sulking and bickering between the two of us. Gradually, I not only hate my wife, but also hate my children. But I can't leave them, abandon them, because this is called family, and I must always live with them, because this is called they are my wife, I should provide them with everything. And also listen to them bestowing all kinds of troubles or disturbances, because these shackles, this burden, were originally put around my own neck with my own hands, who will I complain about, it's all my own fault.</p>

<h3 id="e249">Night <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Jun</p>
<p>The city has no night, the city is a city that never sleeps, the black divine power of night can never be exerted here, it is always replaced by the golden world of electricity. The bright colors of the red lights are flashing everywhere, boundlessly permeating the entire urban space. You stand on that most complex street, the strong lights burn that corner completely red, and the lights are like light smoke, floating with the wind, sometimes suddenly condensing, blocking the scenery outside your eyes like a thick fog, and sometimes suddenly dispersing, so a street buried on both sides with skyscrapers becoming like a deep alley, stretching forward, cars are speeding on the deep alley-like street, using the front lights that seem to be searchlights, shooting so that people's eyes are dizzy.</p>
<p>The impression of a completely red color cluster will make you unable to withstand too complicated stimulation, and have a feeling of neurasthenia.</p>
<p>Not enough? There are also the sounds vibrating on your auditory system, like the sound of waves boiling, the sound of trams, the sound of heavy trucks, the chaotic sound of people, the sound of songs and strings, and the fascinating popular songs that the radio and broadcasting machines in those fashionable shops are broadcasting as special evening programs.</p>
<p>And what is reflected in your visual function is the dazzling flow of vehicles and horses, the flow of people, the interwoven images of coming and going activities, flashing past like a movie, slipping past.</p>
<p>Do you still have a trace of the idea of night existing in your mind?</p>
<p>While taking small steps, you may already be leisurely doing all kinds of strange rose-colored dreams, and demonic desires are quietly active in your tiny blood vessels, this is not impossible, because all around are some seductive material factors, an occasional illusion, a moment of carelessness, you can regard the neon lights hanging in mid-air as the seductive eyes of women, this illusion is the easiest to occur, in fact, passing by your side, brushing against you are some light soft organic bodies captured with a smiling face and spraying a full body of fragrance!</p>
<p>So you can do all kinds of bad things that you would never do during the day, in the night city, in any corner that is both bright and dark.</p>
<p>And when you step by step walk towards those towering high-rise buildings that climb towards the sky, with tips that cannot be seen, like giants squatting on the corners of the street, you may unconsciously stop and listen to the strings of intoxicating jazz music from above, undulating out of the lilac-colored window lattice, melting into the tranquil night sky that is already late and filled with rolling mist, but lingering in your heart, and the heart is fragile, as if something strange suddenly rushed down.</p>
<p>Pushing you up like a dream. But now it is night, and dawn is still far away.</p>
<h3 id="e250">The Singing Child <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Ying</p>
<p>The summer evenings in the market town are not very lonely. Although the shops have all boarded up, the bright lights still quietly flow out from the half-closed doors, shimmering on the dark surface of the market river. The round bridge spanning the market river is filled with people of all kinds enjoying the cool air, draped in jackets, enjoying the southern breeze from the water's surface in early summer. The teahouses naturally have even better business, as if the fatigue of the day is dissolved in the slow conversations and light yellow tea. The child, as usual, dragging lazy steps, pulling the erhu in his hand, slowly walked through the dark streets. The sharp sound of the strings vibrated in the calm air, attracting the attention of everyone relaxing. Everyone knew it was that child again. In the white-hot brilliance of the gasoline lamp, his thin figure and sallow face were reflected, and his little fingers were maneuvering the old erhu in his hand. —The child was not even thirteen or fourteen years old, he was a wandering child without relatives or family, no one knew his name or origin. Since last month, he, like a fallen leaf, drifted to this market town, and every night he sang in the streets and teahouses, and with a few vulgar ditties, he filled his stomach, but during the day he slipped into the Guandi Temple at the end of the market to doze off.</p>
<p>He raised his sallow face, looking at those tea drinkers looking at him with tired and weak eyes, the sound of the strings in his hands slowly stopped, waiting for the tea drinkers to give orders. So 'Meng Jiangnv', 'A Prostitute Sues in the Underworld', 'Ten Cups of Wine', these ditties came out of the tea drinkers' mouths. The sound of conversations in the teahouse gradually lowered, and even the people cooling off on the Guohua Bridge turned their ears and eyes to the teahouse. The lamplight clearly reflected this tiny child. The mournful, sobbing sound of the erhu trembled coarsely a few times, and then the child's singing also broke out sharply: 'In the first month comes the New Year, every household lights red lanterns...' Although the voice was sharp and loud, it was mixed with a hoarse sound, vibrating like a sigh, like an iron wheel rubbing against a cement surface. Every tea drinker was drawn in by his voice. Then, in response to the ups and downs of the erhu sound, he also sang 'A Prostitute Sues in the Underworld', his body swaying with the sound of the strings and singing, as if imitating obscene postures. This further won the favor of the tea drinkers. The tea drinkers almost forgot everything, and were intoxicated by this child.</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>When the singing and string music stopped, the child seemed to suddenly stiffen. A flush rose on his sallow face, and a wave of pleading shone in his eyes. His thin body moved among the tea drinkers, accepting the coins for tomorrow's life, the tea drinkers also rose and fell with noisy conversations, and a faint sigh floated around. After the child finished collecting the coins, he pulled up the coarse erhu again, dragging his slow steps, and left the brightly lit teahouse, his tiny figure slowly disappearing in the darkness, and the sound of the strings also vaguely disappeared. The southern breeze of early summer still brushed across the river surface... the season was still lush April, but in front of the child was a dark road.</p>
<h3 id="e251">From Guangdong Province <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Jingfu</p>
<p>I always loved to float back to my hometown in Guangdong, to that beautiful, serene countryside, enjoying myself leisurely; it was like living in a beautiful dream. I returned with such a feeling. But I seemed to have stumbled into another frightening realm. After only a few hurried days, I couldn’t bear to stay in my hometown any longer. Nursing an excruciating wound, I started my wandering journey anew.</p>
<p>It was the lychee season in May, but I didn’t bring back any sweet lychees. I only carried the stinging impression in my heart!</p>
<p>Reaching Chaozhou city, I passed through the main street. The Four Scholars Pavilion appeared ahead. I remembered the sedan chair shop that our family's business used to call upon most frequently was located on the left side of the pavilion. I got out of the car, intending to conveniently hire a sedan chair to quickly get home. I still thought that upon stepping into the sedan chair shop, I would surely hear the familiar, funny Chaozhou accent calling out "Fifth Young Master." But upon closer inspection, the shop was gone. Fortunately, I heard someone from a nearby shop say, "It closed a long time ago!" I went towards our family’s business with great surprise and doubt. In broad daylight, the door was actually closed. Pushing it open, it was cold and quiet. After calling out several times, no one came out. Disheartened, I turned a corner and saw the desolate main hall and the locked warehouse. Only then did a frail old man slowly emerge from the back hall, gaping in shock. "Uhhh..." This was Uncle Zhen, an old employee who had lived in the business for over forty years. He lamented as if in tears.</p>
<p>"Are you still dreaming? Your family's Siam business closed down last year. This place went under in January. Think about it, the salary I saved up for over a decade was all deposited in the business. Think about it, I've worked hard for decades... Do I even want my life anymore? Go back and tell your brother, there isn't even money for food here. How am I supposed to guard this empty house? You still want to take a sedan chair? The sedan carriers have long gone back to their hometown! There are cars to Shikeng now, you know? Those damned cars! On the stretch from Shikeng to your home, there are often bandits. The wealthy have all fled and dare not return! You still dare to take a sedan chair to look for bandits?" I listened to his long speech, and my breath almost stopped. After a long daze, I hurriedly asked him again, what about the coolies who carried the ancestor's luggage? He became even angrier. "Damn it, there are trucks now! Even if there weren't trucks, who has anything for them to carry? The returning overseas Chinese are gone. The wealthy don't come back..."</p>
<p>I felt like I was lost in a dense fog, confused and dazed. I took a car to Shikeng, then climbed up the old mountain ridge that I used to walk in my early years, all alone, to go home. I planned to spend the summer at home, but the sights and sounds around me were suffocating. Those terrible rumors, the sounds of panic, the nighttime disturbances and gunfire, all urged me to leave quickly. Thus, in an embarrassing situation, I was sent away by my tearful mother.</p>

<p>Regarding the matter of Mr. Wang Xiaolin and the Starlight Society, both sides' letters have been published separately. The truth of the matter will be judged by the public. Now, according to a letter from Mr. Wang, the previous letter from the Starlight Society is completely contrary to the facts. The editor, not understanding the truth, is not convenient to publish both sides' letters at length any further. Please forgive us. This announcement,</p>

<h3 id="e255">Ren Pengnian Creates a New Record <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>Ren Pengnian is a master of martial arts film direction. This time, he has changed his style and directed the sound film "Madness," which has been successfully completed and will soon be screened at the Jincheng Grand Theater. "Madness" is not only fully sound but also has bright and dazzling colors. Sound in domestic films is fashionable and popular with audiences. Now "Madness," with sound and color, is indeed a new record created by Ren Pengnian in the Chinese film industry. When it is released, movie fans will definitely be eager to see it first.</p>
<h3 id="e256">Cui Xingzhou Postpones Stage Performance <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>The young magician Cui Xingzhou was recently hired by the Carlton Theater to hold a farewell performance before his world tour. It was originally scheduled to be on stage today (the 14th), but unexpectedly, a large number of props, a small part of which was still left yesterday, had not yet been delivered. Carlton, considering that the matter was sudden and difficult to handle, insisted on the performance as scheduled. However, Cui insisted very much and absolutely refused to be hasty. Therefore, after consultation, it was decided to postpone the performance for a week, to be staged on the 20th of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e257">Miss Huang Yun of the Shanghai Opera Society <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<h3 id="e258">Kuai Huo Lin Yinye <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>The song "Under the Moon" sung by Xia Peizhen in "Little Aunt" is full of sweet meaning and has been recorded on a disc by Baidai Company. The song "Flowery World" sung by Ying Yin in the same film will also be recorded in the near future.</p>
<p>"Little Aunt" has finished almost all of its scenes after shooting a little bit of exterior scenery the day before yesterday. The screening date is not far away. Kuai Huo Lin will sell a special "Little Aunt" publication when the film is released to benefit the audience.</p>
<p>"Little Aunt" has hired Du Yu for photography. The composition of the picture, the softness of the light, and the liveliness of the lens are all very beautiful, especially the scenes of several night scenes.</p>
<p>In the "Little Aunt" filming location, Xia Peizhen can be said to be the most hardworking. She seems extremely excited and energetic in everything. Xia Peizhen said that the Xia Peizhen in "Little Aunt" must have some new creation.</p>
<p>Luo Jun plays the enthusiastic young man in "Little Aunt." When screening the footage, Mr. Hu Xinling, the director of the Cultural Company, was amazed by his superhuman performance and immediately invited him to star in the Cultural Company's "Parents and Children."</p>
<p>In "Little Aunt," Ying Yin has been an enthusiastic and lively girl, has been a girl who has had a child and became a mother, has been a girl who has shed tears of lost love, and has also been a girl who has clenched her fists and moved forward.</p>
<h3 id="e259">"City Scenery" Mu Zhi Breaks Ground <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>Yuan Muzhi, who has a research interest in art, has a reputation for stage performance comparable to Westerners. His acting skills on the screen have successively released brilliant rays of light in "Peach and Plum Tribulation" and "Children of the Storm." This time, directing "City Scenery," he is using his rich experience and carefully accepting the opinions of friends to study and design it. It seems that in addition to understanding the subtle tastes of art, he has also incorporated the power of scientific control, not only avoiding accidental waste in material terms but also experiencing the pleasure of ease and familiarity in spirit. Yesterday, I watched the opening ceremony of "City Scenery" and learned that the position and angle of the camera had already been marked on the design card. Therefore, the work procedure also appeared orderly and unhurried. Two were still life shots, and two belonged to the actors' postures (a total of four shots were successfully completed in less than an hour).</p>
<h3 id="e260">The Lyrics of Love in Peach Blossom Fan <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>Since Ouyang Yuqian, Jin Yan, Hu Ping, Wang Cilong, and others joined New China Film Company, there is an abundance of talent, forming a strong film group. Since filming "Peach Blossom Fan," progress has been smooth, and work is intense, vowing to complete this great representative work in the shortest possible time. There are many lyrics in the film. When the characters Fang Yumin and Xie Sufang get married in the play, there is a song that says, I love you, you and I are on the same front. Even if the seas dry up and the stones rot, it will not destroy our chastity. Stop lingering in flowery mornings and moonlit evenings. Lingering in flowery mornings and moonlit evenings will make you forget the responsibility on your shoulders. For the survival of the nation, we must engage in close combat and move forward. For the liberation of the masses, we must bravely take the lead. Let the stormy waves and fierce waves stir up the sky. You and I will hold hands, share our hearts, and connect our steps. Only then will we see the sincerity of love, the sincerity of love. It is composed by famous musicians and is extremely beautiful.</p>
