<h3 id="c20">春賑與救濟農村 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>— 微</p>
<p>今年天時反常。冬暖轉寒。春季農作。收成大减。嚴冬方過春荒又來。被災貧農。倍形顚困。據最近消息。蘇省江北各縣。四鄉飢民紛紛向殷戶搶食。卽素稱富庶之無錫。本年亦迭次發生搶米之案。民食艱難。於此可見一斑。　茲者春耕期屆。農民在在需要資本。種籽·肥料·農具·耕牛。不可或缺但一般貧農。丁此時艱。焉有餘力以從事置備。然不備則又何來本年之收穫。故就貧農言。此實彼等之生死關頭。就國家言。此又不僅與民食問題有直接關係。抑且於社.治安。亦有間接之影響焉。</p>
<p>以是朝野上下。咸覺春賑之重要。對於春賑事宜。現正多方進行。政府除巳通過救濟準備金五千萬元外。最近賑務委員長許世英並向政府商定辦法。由政府撥欵二十萬元。爲購買種籽之經費。分發受災各省農民分種。再由各省省政府担任半數。購買種籽。貸給農民。不取利息。俟其秋收償還。此種施賑貸賑之辦法。於農民以及民食問題皆有裨益。實屬救濟農村必要之措施也。</p>
<p>惟辦賑非易事也。吾國歷次脤災。報紙宣傳。不可謂不力。賑濟辦法。不可謂不週。然而災民之能得有實惠者。則數實寥寥。此其故。蓋由於査災之欠詳明。査不詳。則難免有濫施或漏發之弊。馴至待賑者反不得賑。而地方之狡黠者得施其從中詐取之技。是故辦理春賑。亦必先明各地之實况。因地施宜。務使賑欵悉能及於眞正之災民。此則辦賑者不可不深加注意者也。</p>
<p>然脤災本爲救濟農村之治標辦法。以吾國年來災忠之頻。災區之廣。僅恃賑濟。不但杯水車薪。於事少補。且以有限之國帑。耗費於消極之救濟。亦殊非一勞永逸之計。故除必要救濟以外。尤應講求種種積極有效之方法。例如（一）銀行之放欵農村。（二）各地成立信用合作社。及農本借貸處。使農民緩急之需。有所吿貸。（三）增設倉廩調節糧食等等。皆須平時一一爲之籌劃進行。以促農村經濟之改進。農村經濟若能日趨改進。則凡人力所能防免之災荒。自可不致再頻頻勃發矣。此外水利事宜。亦須積極促進。蓋講求水利。亦屬預防旱潦之必要措施。且於增進農村之生產。亦有莫大之補助也。總之。治標與治本。必須兼籌並顧。庶被災各區之農民。有來蘇之望。而農村經濟亦可逐漸好轉矣。</p>

<p>內閣復决定增加外相西門及掌靈大臣艾登締結條約之權力、可證斯特里薩會議之重要、麥唐納首相並將親自出席、而法總理佛蘭亭及意相墨索里尼亦將赴會、英國之法定參加法俄恊定、世人殊爲驚奇、因向來世人祗知英國贊成防守互助之意見而已、英國將以對德之破壞和約重整軍備一事、不取激烈手段、爲其參加斯特里薩會議之政策、並將勸誡法意代表、吿以此係新時代、當以前途有何危險爲前提、而不能以德國戰前之差誤爲根據、至於奥匃保三國之重整軍備、英國已與意國同意、卽聖日耳曼條約簽字國家、應准許三國重整軍備、以爲三國遵守條約之酬報云、（九日國民電）</p>

<p>包爾溫氏演說　英不願有戰爭</p>

<p>倫敦報紙評論可　政策一斑</p>
<p>（倫敦）各大報今日皆評論斯特里薩會議事、泰晤士報謂英國不欲更負歐洲之任務、英國外交家必須注其全力邀德重聯云、每日電聞報請無論辯論何種區域公約、但以集團的安全根據於國聯盟約第十六條之主張、應佔討論中之主要地位云、每日導報謂今唯鞏固國聯全部機構所成之和平、始爲可恃云、愛聞報請英國應無保留的擔任參加集團的行動、以抗圖以武力變更歐洲地圖之任何國云、晨郵報謂事之能使德國感覺已淪於自擇的孤立絕望地位、莫英國挺然出爲領導若、吾人放棄無結果的椑闔而毅然以唯一可保成功之方法參與保障和平、今已其時云、每日捷聞謂英國如拒絕加入歐洲之喧爭、而爲自己人民維持和平、則必受人人之尊重云、每日郵報請勿與俄交易、勿圖包圍德國、而當立卽建設最强之空軍、（九日路透電）</p>
<p>安全廣大計劃　不欲排除德國</p>
<p>（倫敦）國會方面豫測內閣擬向斯特里薩會議提出一種天空互助之廣大計畫、以爲英國對於安全制度之貢獻、此種計畫、係以限制各國空軍力爲基礎、所謂安全制度、其範圍務較東歐區域公約爲廣泛、關於此層、英國在斯特里薩會議所當採取之態度、現雖未能確定、但所謂廣大計畫、或主網羅曾經參戰各國、而不排除任何一國、於此有一問題發生、卽德國若果自行排除、其他各國又將何以爲計是也、一般人印象、以爲德國如能加入此項計畫、則英國凖備承認其軍備完全平等權利以爲交換、特在全體關係國家舉行會議之前、斯特里薩會議對於此層、未必有所决定耳、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>拉氏對此全歐公約計劃、詳加檢討、其言日、「十五年來之經騐證明、各國决無力量負起一種責任、在未經前知之情勢及未經前知之事件中、對於未經前知之國家予以援助、豈東方公約所遇之困難、已令此種經騐有所變更乎、如區域公約尙不易實現、則欲令一切國家遇有戰事、負起確定義務之體系、將更少實現之機會、此點已由經騐瞪明之矣、波蘭與德國所稱不願同意東方公約之論點、不能令人信服、因德波兩國對於若干有明顯規定　之矛盾之國家、猶不能擔負任何確定之義務、乃謂彼等在遼遠之領土以內、在不可知之事件之中、能有反對侵略國家之舉動乎、若輩草擬此項普遍而包含一切國家之公約之計劃者、其目的無非欲令東方公約長期逗留於無用的國際談判之中、而德國報界之所以贊同此項計劃、亦卽以此、然此固非僅僅有關於德波之問題也、凡一普遍公約而欲令各國所負義務加强者、設無英國簽字、則其事絕不可能、唯英國則絕不願在大陸負更多之義務、如有人焉、要求英國政府確切負責、對於歐洲被侵襲之國家予以援助、則彼必加以拒絕、同時如其所負義務、並不確切規定、則其有助於增進安全者實屬無幾、反之、此類糢糊之義務反能發生有害之結果、因如此則爲危險所威脅之國家將爲之和緩、由此遂援助侵略國家完成其目的、故此項普遍協定决不能接受也、予料此項計劃之草擬者於數月外交談判以後、彼等所站之地位及其所遇之困難、必一如今日、所不同者、若輩願意爆發戰爭者、已多得時間以事準備耳、（八日塔斯電）</p>

<p>華沙　但澤市議會選舉臨時結果、議席分配大約如下、</p>

<p>（柏林）國社黨方面對於但澤市議會選舉結果、頗爲失望、國社黨本希望至少可獲得三分之二之議席、如是則反對黨無能爲力、而但澤自由市之制度、可隨意加以變更矣、就但澤之特殊情形及德國與波蘭之關係、德國必須遵守但澤憲法所規定之程序、不便以武力佔據但澤、若國社黨獲得三分之二之議席、則可依照合法手續、宣佈但澤合併德國、而使凡爾賽條約中關於但澤自由市之條欵、實際上歸於無效、然此次選舉結果、國社黨雖較前多得六席、而與三分之二之多數則尙差四席、因此德國各報、僅謂國社黨在但澤所得票數大見增加、並未慶賀此次選舉之勝利、此層頗値注意、蓋國社黨若干人士、咸認此次選舉、其意義實超越但澤市之範圍、如在但澤獲得大勝、則在米美爾甚至在奧國舉行公民投票、已造成先例、今乃不然、在但澤選舉竟未得逞、則宜乎國社黨之大失所望也、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3 id="c125">宋子文發表　政府增資中行原因　完全注重於政策並非人事　今後營業方針完全商業化 <a href="#c125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>中央社云、全國經濟委員會常委兼中國銀行董事長宋子文氏、昨晨十時、在中國銀行接見各報社記者、發表政府此次增加中行査本之原意、及中行今後營業之方針、茲將宋氏淡話分紀如下、</p>
<p>政府增資　注重政策</p>
<p>據宋氏談、政府此次增加中國銀行資本、及派本人來此、完全注重於政策、並非人事、本人此次亦爲促成政府政策而來、自就職迄今、絕未帶來一人、中國銀行人材濟濟、本人希望此後决不增派一人來此、本行全體職員、現均照常努力、於此可見中行全體職員、均已明瞭政府之意旨、前者、市塲一般人、不明中行變更之原因、謠言中行今後之信用、將不如以前之穩固、惟迄今本行及各分行之存欵、並未减少、且新存戶源源而來、凡此事實、中行二千餘職員及金融界同人、均所深知、於此更可知社會亦已明暸政府之意旨矣、</p>
<p>中行今後　營業方針</p>
<p>中國銀行、今後之營業方針、决完全商業化、剷除一切官僚之習慣、而努力於國際匯兌、注重進出口之貿易業務、與中央銀行完全不相衝突、如此方可使各行以本身之力量、發展業務、宋漢章先生、前在袁世凱時代、力使中行鈔票不停兌、此次膺任中行總經理、頗慶得人、至於政府所派官股董事、如錢新之·葉琢堂·吳達銓·胡筆江·王寳崙。諸先生、均係商界中人、於此更可證實政府變更中行、完全注重政策、並非人事云云、</p>
<p>宋氏否認　經濟統制</p>
<p>宋氏對外間所傳中央中國交通三銀行增加資本後、將進行經濟統制云云、加以否認、且謂、政府此次增加三銀行資本、仍係根據民國十八年所定之政策、蓋中央銀行係國家銀行、代理國庫收支、中國銀行、注意國際匯兌、交通銀行發展實業、迄未變更也、</p>
<p>救濟工商　業之推進</p>
<p>關於救濟工商衰落問題、中央中國交通三銀行、正在商議進行中、俾垂危之工商業、能於短時間、得有昭蘇之望、至於工商業信用小借欵五百萬元、係由財部與銀行界各半擔任、亦正在積極推進中、宋氏對市傳政府將統制發行鈔票云云、表示未有所聞、想此係對省銀行而言、决非指商業銀行也、</p>
<p>視察分行　暫緩入川</p>
<p>宋氏本定於日內入川考察、茲以接任中國銀行董事長伊始、各項事宜、在在待理、故一時不能抽身入川、並擬於總行事宜處理就理後、分赴各分行視察、其行程是否將先赴平津、刻尙未决定也云云、並悉、宋氏定十日在總行設讌、歡宴該行人員、以資聯歡云、</p>

<p>下午到滬</p>
<p>王氏所乘之法輪福利勞賽爾號、本定於昨晨到滬、嗣因天氣不佳、直延至下午四時始到滬、泊於虹口招商局中棧碼頭、王氏夫人施美利女士·及前任駐瑞典公使朱昌年夫婦·前駐朝鮮總領事盧春芳夫婦·前外部秘書劉雲舫·及吳凱聲律師·等多人、均往碼頭歡迎、王氏到滬後、卽於四時半上岸、當偕夫人等、遄返古抜路寓次休息、</p>
<p>王氏談話</p>
<p>王氏於抵滬時在輪次向記者談、此行視察、感想甚佳、華僑之商業不振情形。以前以爪哇之糖商·新加坡之樹膠商·西貢之米商·以及馬尼剌之出入口商、受世界經濟凋敝之影響爲最深、但自今年以來、已較去年轉佳、將來且大有復興之望、至於新加坡方面、英人對未來世界戰爭之準備情形、王氏謂、此係他人之軍事秘密、本人不便有何談述、但吾人不問亦可揣測、知共大概也、菲律賓之獨立運動、現正在積極進行中、明春卽可實現、第一任大總統、一般觀察、均認爲勢必屬於前議長奎松氏無疑、</p>
<p>携來贈品</p>
<p>王氏昨日到滬時、携有箱籠等件頗多其中有兩巨箱內藏馬萊所產之巨大蝙蝠及鱺魚各一、據王氏謂、此項巨大蝙蝠、爲我國所無、大可五六英尺、係馬萊華僑陳來康君所贈云、</p>

<h3 id="c187">吳邦偉談改進社會體育意見　先從現有體育塲擴充整頓入手　現有社敎機關應佈置運動環境 <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>江蘇省立鎭江體育塲塲長吳邦偉、此次來滬出席敎部召集之各省體育傷長聯席會議、上海社記者、昨特往訪、據談對於改進社會體育意見甚詳、茲錄如下、</p>
<p>根本問題　吳氏首謂改進社會體育之根本問題、（一）整個社會體育、絕不長少數體育界人能担負的、如何能使地方行政敎育的責任者、以大力來推動、（二）社會體育經費、除體育塲外、更無指定欵項去謀發展、以一城的人口、和一體育塲經費比較、平均每人每年只化到幾分或幾厘當然舒展不來、如何使地方社會體育經費有確定預算、（三）社會生活環境如此、民衆對於體育之認識又如彼、社會體育的設施、就沒有正確的對象、如何使工商界每日有確定時間從事去運動、</p>
<p>改進方法　吳氏次談改進方法、謂在以上根本問題沒有解決以前、大規模的擴充體育、結果　是一定失敗、無成效、不經濟的、所以從現有的體育塲加以擴充整頓、現有的社會敎育機關酌設運動塲所設備、公共塲所佈置體育環境、是今日改進社會體育的適宜方法、現有體育塲擴充整頓、必須充實經濟設備、逕用優良人才、確定最低限度的工作事項、及事業數量、注重兒童體育有適量之文字常識、勞作訓練、同時使民衆學校私塾學生等缺乏體育訓練者、按時到體育塲覓得一部固定對象、</p>
<p>社教機關　至現有社會敎育機關公共傷所酌設運動塲、第一各社敎機關如民農敎育館等一律設小規模運動塲、屬康樂部管理、第二增撥吳農敎育館經費指定爲體育衛生設施的用途、第三參酌經費設備情形、訂定事業標準、第四在民農敎館受固定訓練之民衆、酌予游戲運動機會、每日或每次以七五分鐘至二十分鐘爲度、第五公園特關運動部酌設置球塲、及兒童游戲器機、</p>
<p>學校方面　吳氏最後謂、以現在學校運動塲言、供本校學生課外活動尙感不足、開放於民衆事實上有困難、一切管理指導消耗猶其餘事、且以一紙命令使學校開放、而無人主持推進、民衆未必便去運動、但不妨作初步試探、卽學校舉行任何運動比賽、均設公開組、一切報名手續、均託體育傷代辦、借用學校傷地佔用一部份時間、使民衆多得參加機會、如此方成功、方能進一步謀學校運動塲開放云云、</p>

<p>— 衛術</p>
<p>讀者諸君！去年讀者階級公認爲雜誌年。今年將成爲什麽年呢？着眼於出版界的三個月的過程，我試爲諸君杜造一個名字！「舊書年」。</p>
<p>書商一面秉承着雜誌年的意緒，盲目底地競爭着市塲，專門憑籍雜誌的銷售的中間商也就出現了。一面是停止出新書，僅以舊書的販賣與翻印，用以粉飾門面。整批被置於眞實的，歷史底的評價而放置的典籍圖書，目下於是正在猖獗着。這正因爲「書」是企業的一部門，受周期性的恐慌的自然律所支配的緣故。</p>
<p>「舊書年」顧名思義，是破舊的書。目下，有一半以上專出新書的書店舉行减價，把稍有汚潰的破損的書，以最低廉的價錢出售。書商眼瞪瞪地看在好市况期間，因競爭而瘋狂地出版的「書」這商品大量地堆積着，不得不忍痛削價，使它周轉成爲貨幣。</p>
<p>而「舊書年」的另一對象，就質上說，是古老陳腐的書的競爭。一書店出版袁中郞文集，別一書店便印行袁中郞全集。因二十五史與二十六史的翻印競爭，以致涉訟等等，是隨手摭拾的最好的例子。最近某書店以編印初期十年的新文學動態的文學大系來號召，這舉動是此較聰明的。因爲翻印舊書，成本的負担一定較爲輕微，至少稿費是無庸出了的；並且可以將書價任意抬高，再有是不致遭受什麽危險。然而却因篇幅浩瀚，定價昂貴的緣故頗使書業脫離了一般的讀者階級，有成爲一種裝飾風雅的趨向。總之舊書的抬頭，一面是從事「書」的工作人的沒落；一面是因爲購書能力薄弱，同時更無從得書，閙着智　　　而促使讀者階級沒落了。這事實足以招致文化　　頓與衰微，是最明頭不過的事。</p>
<h3 id="c202">悟 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 另境</p>
<p>講到悟，大約基督敎是講不過釋道的。宗敎之所以爲宗敎，使人悟是一個重要的原素，沒有悟就不會生出迷戀之情，那就沒有信仰，宗敎是存在不了的。「唔，原來如此！」這是平常生活裏常要碰到的「悟」，不過平常人一悟之後並不就能永遠不用再悟，雖宗敎家不斷地在點醒你：「回頭是岸」，其能眞正從此洗心革面的究屬不多，第二次跳下黄浦去還是有的。</p>
<p>地球上自有人類以來，宗敎已經存在了，現在的宗敎大率主倡和平的，然而原始宗敎並不就如此，這轉變我以爲是宗敎史上的一大進步。何以回敎不及基督敎的勢力，謨罕默德手持的那把鋼刀是很有關係的，以武力來刦持人心的，卽使能「吃」也不會當眞一心一意來做你信徒，甚督比他聰明，然仍脫不了是「吃」，萬事一到吃，總不會沒有唱和者的。</p>
<p>然則「悟」豈不都要從「吃」出發了麽？也不盡然的，世上儘有因吃到碰壁而悟的，如佛敎的釋迦牟尼就因爲吃得太飽了纔發狠去悟的，不過這種例子不多見就是。大半的「悟」却是爲肚饑，當肚子饑餓的時候，纔能眞正有「悟」的情感起來，這時的「悟」已不是手執鋼刀的謨罕默德所能左右，歷史上的造反可說是「悟」的最大表現。</p>
<p>宗敎家往往說「這人悟了」，其意義等於說「這人肚子饑了」，所以世俗稱信徒爲「吃敎的」，可說是最徹底的註釋，病不諱醫，我想宗敎家聽了這話也該首肯的。故總而言之，「悟」的根原是「餓」，牠向兩種傾向發展：一種是出世的，就是敎徒；一種是入世的，就是革命者。像釋迦牟尼，可說是悟的至上主義者，說得露骨些，他只是變態的「悟」吧了。</p>
<h3 id="c203">論「文人相輕」（二） <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>約當紀元五世紀前後，南方文人對於音調在文學上的應用特加注意。南史陸厥傳云：「永明時，盛爲文章，吳興沈約，陳郡謝眺，瑯玡王融以氣類相推轂。汝南周顒善識聲韵。約等文皆用宮商：將平上去入四聲，以此制韵，有平頭，上尾，蠭腰，鶴膝。五字之中，音韵悉異：兩句之內，角徵不同；不可增减，世呼爲永明體」。在沈約這方面以爲「自靈均以來，多歷年代，雖文體稍精，而此秘未覩。至於高言妙句，皆暗與理合，匪由思至」。（宋書謝靈運傳論）以爲「自古詞人，豈不知宮羽之殊，商徵之別；雖知五音之異，而其中參差變動，所昧實多。故鄙意所謂此秘未睹者也。以此而推，則知前世文士，便未悟此處。若以文章之音韵，同弦管之聲曲，則美惡妍蚩，不得頓相乖反；譬猶子野操曲，安得忽有闡緩失調之聲？以洛神比陳思他賦，有似異中之作。故知天機啟則律呂自調，六情滯則音律頓舛也。」（答陸厥書）而和他相反的鍾嶸，便提出別一種主張：「昔曹劉殆文章之聖，陸謝爲體二之才，銳精研思，千百年中而不聞宮商之辨，四聲之論，或謂前達偶然不見，豈其然乎？嘗試言之：古曰詩頌，皆被之金竹，故非調五音無以諧會。…今旣不被管弦，亦何取於聲律邪？……王元長創其首，謝眺沈約揚其波，三賢或貴公子孫，幼有文辯，於是士流景慕，務爲精密，襞積細微，專相陵架，故使文爲拘忌，傷其眞美。余謂文製本須諷讀，不可蹇礙，但令淸濁通利，口吻調順，則爲足矣。至平上去入，則余病未能；蠭腰鶴膝，閭里已具。」（詩品序）他們之間只因文詞技巧上的局部執着，彼此意見也有這樣的歧異，以致攻駁無休，也是文人相輕的一相。</p>
<p>托爾斯泰說：「各派的藝術家互相詆諆，互相污蔑，正好比各派的宗敎家一般。試看現在各派藝術家都是這一派的人批斥那一派的人：譬如在詩裏老浪漫主義派排斥白納司派和頹廢派；白納司派排斥浪漫派和頹廢派；頹廢派又排斥前面幾派和象徵派，象徵派又排斥前面幾派和瑪格派，瑪格派又排斥以上各派……在小說，戲劇，圖畫，音樂裏也都是如此。」（藝術論）因此，在托爾斯泰的藝術觀裏，莎士比亞的戲曲並不能佔什麽地位。卽以明淸間詩家論詩的意見來看，也有一樣紛歧的傾向。李夢陽「倡言文必秦漢，詩必盛唐，非是者不道。」（明史李傳）他攻擊宋詩，說是「詩至唐而古調亡矣。然自唐，調可歌詠，高者猶足被管弦。宋人主理不主調，於是唐調亦亡。黃（庭堅）陳（師道）師法杜甫號大家；今其詞艱澀不香色流動，如入神廟坐土木骸，卽冠服與人等，謂之人可乎？」（夢陽缶音序）而性靈派攻擊何李的格調論，辭鋒也一樣的犀利。袁中郞云：「詩何必唐，又何必初與盛？要以出自性靈者爲眞詩耳。夫性靈，竅於心，寓於境。境所偶觸，心能攝之；心所欲吐，腕能運之。……以心攝境，以腕運心，則性靈無不畢達；是之謂眞詩、而何必唐，又何必初與盛之爲沾沾？」袁子才云：「楊誠齋曰：『從來天分低拙之人，好談格調，而不解風趣，何也？格調是空架子，有腔口易描，風趣專寫性靈，非天才不辦。』……須知有性情則有格律，格律不在性情之外。三百篇半是勞人思婦，率意言情，誰爲之格？誰爲之律？而今談格調者能出其範圍否耶？」（隨園詩話卷一）格調說和性靈說旣是詩論的兩大派，再參加以王漁洋的神韵說，又是鼎足三分了。</p>
<h3 id="c204">童年 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 熾夏</p>
<p>當我看見一羣活潑的孩子在地上跳躍着時，我就會立刻追憶起那逝去的童年，印象是那麽地糢糊，又那麽地淸晰，糢糊得像做過的夢，淸晰得又如親自經歷的事。</p>
<p>二十多年以前，我也如這羣小天使一樣地活潑和快樂呵！如一隻無覇的小鳥，飛翔於自由的天空，遇着痛苦來臨時，我會失聲的哭，若是碰到意外的愉快，也會不盡的笑，小如一羣螞蟻，在亂石堆裏運物的事，也可以費去我一二小時的痴視，不僅自己看了有趣，有時還硬要拉着鄰居的孩子一同去看，看厭了，玩倦了，就會拿起石頭，帮助那打敗者打退那勝利者，於是大家狂笑，各人的面孔，由帶有憐恤的忌妒，流露出慈懷的凱旋，孩子的心是多麼怛白啊！若是說，人間是有濟弱鋤强的事，那麼只有到幼小的靈魂中去找尋的。</p>
<p>有時，我們這羣小朋友間會由於一件小事，大家破臉，但是，過了一息時候，大家默會把那小隙立刻忘記，又親密得和自己的兄弟一樣，我記得，有一次，因爲小朋友令要帮助紅的螞蟻侵占黑的糧食，而我呢！一向就討厭紅的，表示異議，野蠻的令，動手就打，和也就很自然的和他打了起來，足足是有一天的功夫，我們並不開口，但是過了第二天，大家又從復和好了，把往日的小隙，忘記得亁乾凈凈，孩子的心是無瑕的，孩子的外表和內部，是只能顯露同一種顏色的，那是如成人後一樣生氣時還會帶着笑臉對人呢！</p>
<p>孩子雖會淘氣，但是他們是沒有憂慮和計較的，他們的腦子，眞是純潔得如白紙一樣，一切的顏色，都染不上那堅潔的心腑，他們要閙，是爲的要發展他們的童性，自然地仲張他們筋肉，要如人類的世界，永遠是在孩子的時期，我想和平些安寗些的社會，一定可以實現的。</p>
<p>流光如水，黄金時代的童年，竟在我的生命史上溜過去了，當我看見那些小天使活潑潑地跳躍的時候，會有一種羨惜之感，從心底裏發生出來，十年以後，他們也像我們一樣，走上了成人之路，此時片刻的愉快，僅足供日後的無限的回憶而已。</p>

<p>— 駱方</p>
<p>斜陽底光浪漸漸停止波動，</p>
<p>天空由蔚藍而蒼灰；</p>
<p>傍晚的凉風絲絲流入空曠的胸腔，</p>
<p>我威覺若有所失，</p>
<p>載着不寗靜的心往街頭茫然徘徊，</p>
<p>凝視着梧桐樹影在牆頂緩緩移動，</p>
<p>漸漸黯淡，消失。</p>
<p>大氣中飄浮着小麥和荳花底芬香，</p>
<p>庭前的小塊泥地噴放春之氣息；</p>
<p>我深深呼吸着，</p>
<p>感覺難忍的飢渴，</p>
<p>載着鉛鑄的心往街頭茫然徘徊，</p>
<p>凝視着飛雁掠過蒼灰的雲天，</p>
<p>漸漸渺小，消失。</p>
<p>一層薄薄的霧蒙罩着周團</p>
<p>一切景物，糢糊，失去活力，</p>
<p>街頭上充滿喧嚷和煤烟；</p>
<p>我按住着心底跳躍，細聽</p>
<p>遠處火車底幽長的隆呌，</p>
<p>四肢的肌肉微微地抖顫，</p>
<p>茫茫然幻想着南海北國</p>
<p>飛來希望底種子一粒。</p>
<p>我在每個人面前狂笑，</p>
<p>我朝向蒼灰的天空流淚；</p>
<p>但，疲乏浸透全身，</p>
<p>寂寞如像一幅龐大的黑幕懸垂在眼前，</p>
<p>只在無盡的街頭上茫然徘徊，</p>
<p>祈求把握着一些什麽，</p>
<p>興起刺激和沉醉，在一剎那間</p>
<p>遺忘靈魂底悲哀。</p>
<h3 id="c206">巨卿先生（十一） <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 柯靈</p>
<p>他着意窺伺着沈慶中的舉動，找到一點過錯的時侯，立刻把瘦臉一沉，對沈慶中沉重地喊出了一個字：</p>
<p>「來！」</p>
<p>沈慶中剛要把一個紙圈套向旁邊正在鈔書的同學的秋帽結子上，驀然聽見先生的吼聲，倉卒地縮了手，一回頭正碰着巨卿光生一雙深陷而睜大得可怕的眼睛，他惶惑地跑近去。</p>
<p>巨卿先生不說一句話，右手抓起桌上那塊厚厚的「戒方」，左手抓住沈慶中的小手，將它抵住桌角；把自己鬱結着的一切憤怒，怨毒，全集中到右手的「戒方」上面。全堂　然，祇聽見竹片接觸着肉體的淸脆的聲音——</p>
<p>劈，劈，劈，劈……</p>
<p>接連十幾下，小掌已經通紅。巨卿先生一揮手，沈慶中飛快地回到自己的座位，伏在案上，「哇」的一聲，大哭起來了。</p>
<p>這哭聲給了巨卿先生一種徹骨的痛快。</p>
<p>出乎意外地，這體罰敎育的效果還沒有實騐成功，當天晚上就來了一個身材頎長的方臉盤女人，介紹了自己是沈慶中的母親以後，對巨　先生有點冷冰冰的樣子說：</p>
<p>「我們慶中年紀還小，讀書不過是關關書房的，這孩子又生的淸癯，家裏是連重言重語也不大有的；所以請先生以後最好不要這樣打他，現在孩子的手，已經像蟛蟹壳似的腫起來了。」</p>
<p>對於這樣全然不懂禮數的娣人，巨鄕先生差不多要憤怒得跳起來；可是不知怎麽，他一點勇氣也沒有，楞了好一會，一時竟連適當的回答也想不出一句。還是由巨卿師母眯起眼睛在旁邊說了許多好話，這婦人才施施然走了。</p>
<p>因爲這一小小的風波，巨卿先生明朗的心境又陰沉下來。而且多了一種痛切的切師道凌夷」之感。</p>
<p>他因此又是悶悶地好幾大。</p>
<p>隔了不久，巨卿先生的煩惱剛有些湮散，謠　似的風傳又送來了新的憂鬱。平靜的湖上，吹起了意外的風波。</p>
<p>這是比「學風」還沒有辦法，還難於應應的變化，據說：區立小學校知道了各私塾趁着他們鬧風潮的時候捉混水魚，拉了學校裏的學生，現在已經决定對付辦法，要實行報復了。</p>
<p>於是躭着一顆沉重的心，早晚祇聽得各種不同的消息。</p>
<p>一個消息說：區立小學校已經向縣裏進了公事，敎育局不久就要派員下鄕來取締私塾了。</p>

<p>— （楊燮理）</p>
<p>消極，無爲，怕事，明明是隨落而自己總要拿「達觀」來解釋；横衝直撞，無風起浪，明明是胡閙，而自己總以爲是「奩奮」。唉！這樣的「達觀」「奮鬥」有什麽價値呢！</p>
<p>辦事愈努力的，往往卽是愈觸霉頭的；因爲愈努力所負責任亦愈大，而努力不一定就會成功，一旦失敗，那就受責非輕了。</p>
<p>女子大都希望來生是一個男子，男子也有希望來生是女子的，究竟做男子好？還是做女子好？因爲沒有一生旣做男子又做女子的人，所以沒有人能够回答，（可惜女化男身的姚錦屏是假的，否則他可以吿訴我們。）</p>

<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>那是一個和煦的春天的早上，飄飄的風兒，送來了一陣「唔呀晤呀」的新生的孩子的啼哭聲。—哭聲是那麽的雄偉，而且還富有韻味。</p>
<p>門外一陣子嘈雜的人聲，紛紛地傳說着弄口過街樓下，不知是誰家遺棄下的一個私生子。果然，過街樓下，在一堆稻草上面，安着一個小孩子，外面裹着粉紅絨布兒，給一根花帶兒綁着。手和脚是那麽有力的伸縮着，似乎是表示着準備着到這個世界上來奮鬥的。眼角裏是那麽的噙着二小滴眼淚，嘴是張着不住的「唔呀唔呀」的哭着，似乎是自已悲哀着人生的不幸，不幸而爲一個被遺棄了的私生子。</p>
<p>瞧的人是圍了那麼的一大堆，驚奇的也有，歎息的也有，發怔的也有，張着大口兒發笑的也有。但是瞧的人雖是那麼多！孩子雖然是哭得恁般的有勁，可是就設一個有用手去接觸一下子的勇氣，似乎那孩子是帶着不潔，到這個世界上來的不錯瞧熱鬧的，都在紛紛地議論着不知是那一家的傷風敗俗的女兒，幹着這種不要臉的玩意，玩出了這麽個　障。</p>
<p>最後，在入叢中擠出了一位吃素唸佛的老太太？一壁壁念着佛，一壁把那孩子抱起來？解開來一瞧，竟是一個血汚都沒洗凈的男孩子，胸前還藏着二張五元的鈔票，和一封求人留養的信呢。</p>
<p>那老太太念了幾聲佛，把鈔票揣在懷裏，一壁雇了一輛黄包車，把那個私生子，送到了育嬰堂去。</p>

<p>我踏進酒店，是一件難得的事。計算起來，一年之中，恐怕不滿三四次呢？</p>
<p>大約在上個月的中旬吧！我答應了一個朋友的約會，便踏進了一家Ｓ城××廟前街的小酒店去，時候是下午七點鐘光景，正是Ｓ城中華燈燭上的當兒。</p>
<p>我們這一淘，總共有四五個人，大家便揀了一處比較淸雅的桌子上坐去，自然，堂倌們很殷勤的來招待我們了！要了一些酒，揀了幾樣菜肴，我們便開始痛飮起來，在這時，我個人戚覺到人生的一切痛苦，悲哀，惟有喝酒才能够解除痛苦，减少悲哀，無怪一般騷人墨客，大多數都高興和這東西接近了。</p>
<p>一邊吃，一邊談由國家大事而社會瑣聞，由社會瑣聞而個人趣事，各人毫無拘束的坦白的談着，眞不知人間還有什麽虛偽事，假面具呢？我會心地默默的想。</p>
<p>在酒店中，最使我感覺到不滿意的，便是酒客們的嘈雜，他們有的高談闊論，大有懷才不遇的感慨，有的獨飮不語，頗含借酒澆愁的意味，堂倌們奔走侍候於酒客之間，倒也十足的顯出忙碌的樣子。我徊徊地觀察酒店中的一切情况，知道這裏是一個小社會，是一個小世界，你看：酒店中的嘈嘈雜雜，集社會上各個份子各個階級所表現出來的姿態，這不是一個社會的縮影嗎？</p>
<p>「唉。想不到這小少的酒店。倒是一個社會問題的研究處」當我回來的時候。默默地想着。</p>

<p>第十一回　夜話凄凉生涯原是夢履痕零亂風雨太欺人</p>
<p>志前聽了這話，不由得一怔。心裏想着，這一個可憐的女孩子，總想挽救他起來。不想跑來跑去，他總跑不脫這羣魔鬼的掌握。說媒，不知說給誰人。他這樣沉吟着，頗有幾分鐘的猶豫，可是等他淸醒過來的時候，那說話的茶房，早已走遠了。志前甚是後悔，沒有把茶房問個淸楚，究竟是誰人想這女孩子。自已沉吟了一會子，那兩陣裏的斜風，猛然括了兩陣大的，却把那雨絲直向門裏面吹了來。臉上沾了潮氣，就打了兩個冷顫，只好走回房去。在他這房後頭，正有一個窗戶，對了後座院子。他對於浣花作媒的這件事，却是有點注意，因之在屋子裏踱來踱去，只管向後面窗子外看着。約莫有半小時之久，那胡小脚撑了雨傘，帶着笑容來了。看那情形，竟無說媒的事，有幾分成功的希望。自己本當走出去，攔住了他，問個究竟。轉念一想，昨天替朱月英介紹傭工，事情沒有辦妥，人家不免疑心。踱着步子，心裏正考量着。可是等他考量完畢，胡嫂子已是早到賈多才那裏去了。不多久的工夫，胡嫂子又回來了，那風正括得大，傘已是撑不住，他將傘只律了半開，舉着撑罩在頭上，很快的向後門走去。風大，雨自然是斜的，把他的衣服打濕不少。然而他並不介意，從從容容的走了。（一七八）</p>

<p>春雨連綿的下着，把氣候變成寒冷極了。昏黯慘澹的天空，堆起無數灰黑的雨雲，微雨絲絲地成斜綫的　着，打濕了一條亁燥的泥路。</p>
<p>「老爺太太，救救，救救我一個可　的小孩」</p>
<p>那聲音愈趨愈近，幾分鐘後，一個面目黧黑，飢容滿面的小孩子蹣跚地在風雨中走着。</p>
<p>「老伯伯，佈施佈施！」此時小孩子已從雨中走至王家的門口來了，微顫地向守門人求着。</p>
<p>「滾開些　！大淸早起，誰管你這些閒事」。說時，而上國出兇惡樣子。</p>
<p>「老伯伯，我三天沒有吃過飯！發點慈悲，佈拖佈施罷！」</p>
<p>「誰呌你三天不吃飯？可惡的呌化子還不走嗎？」老者聲色俱厲，顯見是發怒。</p>
<p>小孩知道討不着錢，祇得走開了，但是背後一羣狗，便一擁而上，它們怒吼着，奔跑着差不多抓住了小孩子了。小孩子被嚇倒在一條泥濘的路上，一羣狗在他的周身嗅了一會，唱若得勝歌而回去。</p>
<p>當他醒來時，單單衣服，已被雨滲透了，肚子飢餓極了，痛得很厲害，無聊的悲咽，祗增加了幾分餓意，他站起來時，覺得身子完全無力了。一個老婦人提着菜籃從市上回來。</p>
<p>「老婆婆，救救我吧！」小孩子含糊的求着。</p>
<p>「可憐的孩子，爲什麽在雨中走着呢？到那邊王家門口去坐一會吧！」老婦人十二萬分的憐憫，帝着小孩子的手向前走去。</p>
<p>「老婆婆，那……邊我……不去，那邊有可……怕……的狗！」</p>
<p>「可憐的孩子，那麽就到我的家裏去罷！你有幾歲了？」</p>
<p>「老婆婆，十一歲。」</p>
<p>說時已到老婦人家的門口，小孩子畏縮似的不敢進去。</p>
<p>「不要緊的，進去罷！」老婦人很和藹的說着，小孩子便跟着進去，叫他站在外面，自己走進去，把一碗冷飯盛出來，給小孩子吃着。</p>
<p>小孩子急急的把飯吃完，張大子眼，呆呆的看着。</p>
<p>「孩子，你有爺娘嗎？」</p>
<p>「老婆婆，我的父親早沒了，母親去年把我賣到城裏，呌什麼犬王寺的裏面……」孩子說到這劉鵬，語驟止了，面上又形出無竊的恐怖。</p>
<p>「可憐的孩子，放心說罷，現在可不要緊了！你爲什麼變成這樣的呢？」</p>
<p>「老婆婆，我……我……」</p>
<p>「說罷！那有什麼要緊呢？」</p>
<p>老婆婆，你千萬不要對人說起吧！我因爲在寺裏天天挨打，受餓，所以逃出來的，你看我的手脚都被打傷了。」</p>
<p>「這是眞的嗎？那麽你便不能在這裏住了，因爲大王寺裏常有人到我們家裏來的呀！」</p>
<p>「呵！」小孩子聽得便哭出來了「。老婆婆，那怎樣好呢！」</p>
<p>「這是沒法的，你試想像我們這種人家，那裏背得起這種大禍呢！你還是到東街上去，那裏有個老太太，他很慈善或許會收容你！」老婦很憐憫的對小孩子說着。</p>
<p>風愈加盡量的吹着，雨愈加盡量的下着，在風雨之中，老婦人目送着小孩午蹣跚地走去的背影。</p>

<h3 id="c232">文明人的野蠻行動 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 安</p>
<p>近日本地又發生了一件美國水兵毆斃華人案，這在人道主義說來，原是一極不平的事，査外人在中國境內，無故毆打華人的事，常有聽聞。區區再演出這麽一椿，原因不算是怎樣了不得。不過現在旣經又給人打死一個了，國人大家表示一點不平，也是人類應有的常情，想不至於就會被人看做是什麽排外的舉動。</p>
<p>在下忝屬中國人之一，對於我們這一位不幸的同胞，白白慘死在一個美國水兵的手下，當然也免不了裏激動一些熱情。可是我的憤慨，倒並不小題大作，指說這卽是外國帝國主義國家欺凌中國民族的行爲。我是不滿一向一般以文明人自居的人，動不動總喜歡駡別人一聲野蠻！別人旣屬野蠻，他們無疑是文明了。在這裏我要問一問：無端毆人，是文明還是野蠻？這回答如果是文明，文明的意義，眞有點糢糊了。是野蠻呢，這種野蠻的行動，却往往便由文明人表現出來。這樣看法，慣會駡別人野蠻的文明人，其本身原也是野蠻的了。</p>
<p>無端無故逞蠻行兇，這就是文明人的所以爲文明人了吧？</p>
<h3 id="c233">打稖頭疙的伴侶 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 靑峯</p>
<p>那時家裏不算富，也不算道地的窮；並不等着我去拾草來燒鍋，可也不能說純然出於消遣。一半由於母親的慫恿，一半由於自己的好頭，我就揹上糞箕，提着小小的草鋔，加入大羣的孩子隊裏，去打稖頭疙瘩了。</p>
<p>是十月天。</p>
<p>大的太陽，像蒙了灰塵似的，失去了在夏日的威風，露着灰紅的容顏，靜靜地看着地面。曠野的風，因爲無遮無攩，可以橫衝直撞，更顯得精神抖擻。天是灰黄的，地是灰黄的，樹枝是灰黄的，房屋是灰黄的。</p>
<p>可是我們並不感傷，無邪的童心，怎會知道這些呢？我們只覺得這樣好頑，風是我們角逐的敵手，也許以爲由於對手的健壯，反更顯得自己的英勇吧？</p>
<p>那些孩子，都是粗野的孩子；他們是貧苦的農家的孩子，他們是從艱苦掙扎中長大起來的，這從他們的醜陋的然而是堅實的面貌上可以看出來。他們沒有進過書房，他們不懂得禮貌；他們拿相駡代替問好，拿相打代替親愛，有時打得哭起來，有時打得頭破血流，然而不在乎，過一會就好了，仍然是一淘的。在他們的隊伍裏，唯一有斯文氣的，要算是我了，因爲我還是一個沒有脫離書房的孩子呢。他們並不羨慕我，在他們的腦子裏，還沒有灌進「萬般皆下品，唯有讀書高」的毒汁呢。他們只拿奇異的眼光看待我。也許他們在這樣地懷疑着吧：</p>
<p>「這孩子怎麼不駡仗呢，怎麼不愛打架呢？」</p>
<p>雖然在我自己，覺得比其他和我同身份的孩子，已經野得多了。</p>
<p>我們像一羣蜂子，擁到收割過的稖頭地裏去。那折去幹的鬚根，像一只多指的手，緊緊地抓住泥土，被抓的地方，比別處髙聳起來。我們精明地用草錢向那上面敲着，先敲去大塊的泥土，然後拾起來，向錢齒上再批幾下，摜去那上面沾着的鬆碎的泥，於是放到糞箕裏，再去尋第二個礦頭疙瘩。</p>
<p>大家起勁地工作着，疲倦，不能說沒有，可是忘了。還比賽着誰打得最多呢。</p>
<p>像這樣每天可以打到兩　箕，上午</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>一次，下午一次。當我累累巴巴地揹着滿裝着稖頭疙瘩的糞箕回家的時候，母親總要笑嘻嘻地迎上來把糞箕接過去的。有時如果父親在旁邊，她還要驕傲地誇耀道：</p>
<p>「哥子漸漸地有用了。」</p>
<p>於是我樂了，我感覺到獲得了不是尋常的酬報。可是鼓勵若我去打稖頭疙瘩的，倒也並不僅是母親的誇獎。因爲我很相信，像那樣笨重吃力的工作，如果呌我一個人在家裏做，打不到兩個，我就要厭了的，任母親怎麽說，我也會跑開的。然而在怒風長號的曠野，在灰沙蔽空的曠野，有時眼裏淌水，有時掛下鼻涕，我反興奮地工作着，這不能不說是由於那些小小的粗野的伴侶的原故</p>
<p>他們都是有趣的人，從鄙俗的咒駡裏見出天眞，從惡毒的相打裏顯出自然，沒有陰險，沒有狡詐，沒有含淚的强笑，也沒有快意的假哭。這樣的人，在今天，好像沙裏的金子似的，是很難於找到的。</p>
<p>現在，我們是離得遠了，記憶的底片，漸漸地褪了顏色了；而兒時的往事，也只剩得糢糊的影子了。他們在過着什麽樣的生活呢？除去我的想像中的：骷髏似的農夫，兇　似的土匪，流落在街頭的乞丐，輾轉在溝壑的俄殍？</p>
<p>是的，他們還能過到什麽裂的好生活呢？年齡旣然能把我們的天眞帶走，命運又不會把我們的幸福剝奪嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c234">湘子橋畔 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— 凈夫</p>
<p>『在湘子橋畔活着的那些日子，是永遠不能忘記的呵』！</p>
<p>突的飄上那幽然的湘子橋畔的痕迹，會不自禁迷惘的這麽暗忖着。可是，永遠不能忘記的，卻也將是永遠無從再見的了。湘子橋畔的往情，你那裏去了呢？……</p>
<p>越覺得湘子橋畔的日子是分外美麗，越更令人泛起痛楚的回憶，那已經消逝而無從追回的夢般的美麗的日子呵！</p>
<p>彷彿，我將麻木的心腦，猶所到湘子橋下韓江流，衝擊過橋下壁，潺潺的濺奏着閒逸出塵的鳴聲；幽遠的，迷離的湧上悠悠的湘子橋畔的，如烟的往事……</p>
<p>那是從十四歲起，在韓山麓讀書的時候。常常步着幽長的噁堤，沒入靜美的深谷遠處的故鄉去；又從萬山重疊中，幽然飄出噁溪邊，踏着富有詩意的沙灘，走近渡船旁。那輕舟一葉，慢慢的盪着，朝遠望蒼鬱的金山下橫渡，淸曠浩怡的心情如水如夢，這是一顆未曾經風雨吹打的稚美天眞的心，！從渡船的低蓬內探首南望，有些浩渺迷離的緣波上，常常是逢到正當夕陽無限好的時分，斜陽灑在水面似的，絲絲的隨着漪漣的碧渡閃飄，神往的望着。無意的聽着輕逸的船夫動撑的欵乃聲，應和着低奏的水聲，人間的什麽悶惱，都忘却得干凈。船慢慢前進，好像就接連在金山下的浮橋，一舟舟，一堆堆的迤漫，整列的排過江中，遠遠的怖到韓山麓的江邊。這便是湘子橋了呵！急流奔馳的韓江中，無端的浮上幾十個成一直綫，從東門的臨江處，排展到隔江的對岸的韓山麓的大石推成的大碼頭，兩碼頭中間橫着寬長的木橋。碼頭上作滿店家，橋上擺着許多祖子，都是賣點心和嶺南特多的水菓。還散佈着無數的遊人行客，相傳這奇美的韓橋，是文公的化仙的姪子，韓湘子造成的。</p>
<p>我們的校舍，便在韓山麓，湘子橋畔之間，有的是在山上二靠着凈幽靜穆稚緻的韓山，臨望着繞城三酉的韓江淸流中的奇妙可戀的湘子橋，做夢似的安閒讀書，徘徊於山麓，徜徉於橋上橋畔，多麽神往的日子呵！幽靜如醉的坐在宿舍，門口迎着凉爽的嶺南的風，飄飄的。沉穆似痴的倚着宿舍窗外的校園的凉亭柱上，默看着花姸花香，靜聽着蟬鳴的音曲，捧着畫，少年人的心情，是個美麗如紗的夢景！天氣較熱了，上潺潺的山坑盡情的沐浴，聽鳥鳴，聽大自然低奏樂曲，或者躍身韓江畔游泳。春風吹起溫懷，漫步在淸幽的山上，好像在甜睡着。如夜來臨了，月光如銀的漏下樹葉縫，人影婆婆的散漫樹下。或者拖向湘子橋去，登橋四望，像在看一副絕妙的畫，詩意葱蘢三五個知友，不是互相遞笑，昂低吟詩章，豪放呼呌，突破靜美的夜，身上披着薄衣，拖着木屐，憑橋欄聽水聲，噉荔枝，嚼籠圓。回顧韓山，美如銀霧眾着的髙曠出　的校舍幽然在笑。走下江心的沙船去，看着無數的舟子的燈光閃爍，船上的客家女的歌聲淸澈悠奏。沙船邊的碧波微縐，夜深還不願歸去喲！</p>
<p>然而，湘子橋畔的景物那裏去了？幾年來在血泊中輾轉的人生，飄憶這美麗的故夢，誰不神傷？追戀什麽故夢呢！没有追戀，湘子撟畔，於今也許也殘破了，可是，那兒，深印着我的靈魂呵！</p>

<h3 id="c236">結婚遲早的商榷 <a href="#c236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>——給讀者們的一個總答覆——</p>
<p>編者最近接到許多讀者的來信，都是詢問和討論結婚期的早遲的問題。有的主張遲婚，說早婚對於人的害處很多；有的又主張早婚，也提出不少的例證。可是他們對於自己的主張，却有點懷疑，又不敢十分肯定的說是對的，所以便寫信來提出他們的主張，和我們討論，並要求給他們一個明確的指示。</p>
<p>對於這個結婚早遲的問題，我認爲是非常重要，現在特扼要的把我的意見叙述在下面，以作總答覆，不再個別回信，希望詢問這個問題的讀老們注意。</p>
<p>人類的生命永久的維持，是靠着兩性的繁殖，結婚便是達到繁殖的途徑；所以結婚不但是個人的問題，而且是人類發展上的重要的工作。假使我們不研究結婚的一切，盲目地結婚，則其結果將影響到人類的前途。</p>
<p>在舊禮敎下的結婚，只注重那種虛僞的，不切實際的禮節，至於兩性發育的情形，和結婚的年齡適當　否，却很少顧慮到。一般父母受了「男大當婚，女大當嫁」的古訓，又要嘗嘗那含飴弄孫的樂趣，便多迅速地將兒女婚嫁事辦畢，以了一生的願望。因此就有許多人由於結婚過早而遇到惡劣的結果。</p>
<p>一個人到了十四歲左右，然也有早至十二歲，遲至十七歲的，身體上便發生了特異的變化。這種變化便是兩性成熟的象徵，醫學上呌做：「春機發勁期」，在這種春機發動期的兩性，不但肉體上發生變化，精神方面，也有特殊的變化。尤其是感覺到性的需要，對於從前模糊的兩性的區別，這時也已經有了明確的認識。</p>
<p>性的需要，旣在春穖發動期開始，那末春機發動期的早遲，和結婚的年齡當然有很大的關係了。所以世界各國人民結婚的年齡，都根據春機發動期的早遲而定。大槪溫帶的人春機發動期較早，早婚的多，寒帶的人發動期遲，早婚的少。</p>
<p>有許多人主張春機發動期之初便舉行結婚，他們的理由：</p>
<p>（一）性慾是人類的本能，在知道需要性的時候結婚，想不致發生何種害處。</p>
<p>（二）早婚可以免除有害的手淫遺精。</p>
<p>（三）早婚可以防止不道德的行爲，免却花柳病傳染的危險。</p>
<p>這些、確有相當的理由，不能絕對的否認。但我們應當知道春機發動期裏的性的發達，雖已成熟但是身體別部份的發育、還不能算是完全。假使只根據性的成熟，不顧別的情形而結婚，一定有下列的結果：</p>
<p>（一）影響到身體的健全和發育。</p>
<p>（二）所生的子女，因先天不足，體格多不健全，影響種族的發展。</p>
<p>（三）未成年的男女，意志薄弱，多不能節制過度的性慾。</p>
<p>（四）年齡太小，學識未充，不足爲子女的模範。</p>
<p>早婚不但有這幾種流弊，卽使從經濟上，智識上，觀察，結婚過早，也决不會有好的收穫。我們固然反對早婚，但結婚過遲，也不贊成，因爲各有相等的害處。根據各種情形，我們認爲男性在二十五六歲，女子在二十一二歲結婚最好。至於手淫花柳病，確是有害於身體的不良的行爲，但可以利用「性敎育」來救濟。在舊禮敎下的父母，認爲對人，對子女們談論性慾是一種汚穢卑鄙的行爲。這種觀念，實在是錯誤的。外國有許多學者主張兒童到了十歲至十三歲　，應當敎以簡單的生殖器的解剖和生理方面的學識；在十三歲至十六歲左右，可向他說明手淫的有害和花柳病的危險。至於一切有誘致性的本能傾向的浮書，淫畫，淫戯，尤嚴禁和兒童接觸。同時設法引起兒童對於研究學問的興趣，並努力提倡兒童運動，　他的構成性慾精力的要素，消費到勞心勞力的求學和鍜鍊身體的用途上去。使性的本能得到自然的節制，這確是一個良好的辦法。</p>
<p>可惜我國敎育未能普及，而　頑固的父母太多了，有誰能打破虛偽的禮敎，來提倡性的敎育呢？</p>

<h3 id="c241">齊格飛所認爲醜陋的在電影界却成了明星（下） <a href="#c241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— 新尼</p>
<p>至於面貌上的特點，齊格飛式的所謂美，和現在流行的好萊塢美，尤有南轅北轍的分別。那裏或者有幾位女明星，她們兩隻眼睛距離之中，恰恰可以放一隻眼睛，或者她們兩眼的瞳人的相距，恰和鼻尖到眼眉的距離相等——這些都是美的標凖的幾點，但是誰管得了那許多。好萊塢的美，是不可以將規矩的方圓來量的。</p>
<p>康絲登斐涅，在好萊塢是稱爲美麗的，但是她那副方方的下頦，小小的鼻子，非但不中齊格飛的規矩，並且在普通人，亦未必以爲美，但在銀幕上她卻堪稱得一位美人。再以瓊克勞勞而論，她那一對大大的鼻孔，和鼻子的其他部份絕不相稱，並且她的前額是完金男相，但是亦不失其爲銀幕上的美人。</p>
<p>其餘的許多女明星，在面貌上都有特別的缺點。如露絲却德頓，她的嘴顯然的是大而無當的。安哈婷的臉，左右兩個半面是各不相同的。克萊拉寳的臉，上半是凹下去的，下半却是凸出來的。再以神情而論，美麗的瑙瑪希拉的面容，一半是冷淡，一半是熱烈的。琪恩哈羅的鼻子，尖的角度是不合常理的。</p>
<p>總而言之，好萊塢一般的美人，如費蕾，如葛蘿麗亞史琪蓀，如海倫漢絲，如溫妮吉勃孫，耐茜卡洛見，露絲卻德頓，露潑范麗絲，桃樂絲德里奧，克勞黛考爾白，以及凱茀蘭茜絲等等，要照着齊格飛的標凖說起來，都是不及格的。</p>
<p>打破齊格飛的尺度，而能在影界爲明星的，還不限於上面所列的幾個久已成名的演員。卽如最近才紅極一時的茂娜洛埃，亦是不合齊格飛的標凖的。她的相貌完全是個男孩子相，並且滿臉雀斑，還不是個好看的男孩子，但是誰都不能說她醜陋。其餘新進的影星，如英國的伊麗莎白貝格納，以及由小明星升上來的琴穆亞，琪恩派克，約瑟芬赫金蓀等等，幾乎沒有一個是合乎齊格飛的尺度的。</p>
<p>不差的，現在好萊塢的女明星，很小是合乎齋格飛式的美的標凖的，但是反過來說，從前齊格飛手下的一班歌女，將她們放到好萊塢，恐怕亦沒有一個有成功的希望的。這不僅因爲時代的變遷，眼光的不同，而實在是因爲肉眼之所謂美，未必在鏡頭前亦好看也。聯藝公司的主腦，達理爾桑納克曾說：「自從聲片盛行以來，沒有一個女演員，能專靠面容之美而成爲一位明星的。面容之美在攝影塲中，祗値八元錢一天；但是瑙筋却可以値到一百塊錢一天；要是面貌和腦筋合攏起來，那就可以値到一千塊錢一天了！」</p>
<p>美貌的腦筋……這就是好萊塢的方式。因此，一位齊格飛式的美人，她一定要有絕項的聰明，才可以希望在好萊塢成名。茂琳黛維絲就是一個很顯著的榜樣。其餘的如魯琵吉勒瓊勃郞黛兒，諾爾茀蘭茜絲等亦嘗厠身齊格飛美女團之列，但她們都覺得從歌舞界跳到電影界，已不是一條終南捷徑，而美麗的面貌，亦不再是好萊塢的開門符了。（完）</p>

<p>— 伯寗</p>
<p>星期三的晚上，學校裏放映敎育需影。夜自修課是停止了，可是大門口的水菓攤依舊圍着一大堆學生。黑洞洞的自修室裏正拉着京胡，放亮了喉嚨唱「武家坡」，我心裏在怪，「看戲不出錢，他們還不願，這是爲什麼？」隨手拉住一個年紀靑一點的同學，問問他，他撇着二片嘴唇，不屑地道：「誰要看，老是開映些，造紙，捕魚，種珠子，看半次也會看膩的。」於是在我的腦袋裏，頓時加上一個「？」。</p>
<p>我想電影所以能够吸引偌大的觀衆，因爲他的興趣是多方面的，他根據了人類各種的本能，纔配製各種的劇情。人類有「性」的本能，因此有大量的愛情片子，人類有「好鬭」的本能，因此有許多戰爭片子。人類是「好奇」的，因此有整批的偵探片子出現。人類是喜「求知」的，因此許多獸片，各色的新聞片就應運而生。總之人類有幾種本能，電影就有幾種性質。他們常常在變換，在調劑，因此一般觀衆也津津有味，雖百看而不厭。</p>
<p>現在敎育電影，把電影當中挖出一部分，祇着眼於人類求知的一方面。他們所取的材料不是歷史，便是地理，不是生產事業，便是拓邊事業，毫不顧到人類的本能是多方面的。因此用意雖好，可惜太呆板，太無變化，太不合觀衆的心理，於是變成了一部活動的敎科書了，無一怪青年們見了要搖頭。</p>
<p>實際，我們如果要收電影敎育的功效，絕對不能放棄目前電影的俊點，幷且應該儘量地利用他。我們依舊需要愛情片子，偵探片子，戰爭片子，處處吻合人們的本能。不過在攝製的時候，無論取材方面，結構方面，表演方面都顧到敎育的價値，那末電影敎育的使命，就不難完成了。如果硬要把電影當中挖出一部分，呌做「教育電影」，那麽過幾天還有「工業電影」，「商業電影」，「農業電影」，結果都是一部一部活動的敎科書罷了。</p>

<p>藝華公司對於影片中的「佈　景」的認眞，不肯苟且，是已有了事實上的證明。「逃亡」耗去數萬金，遠赴蒙古，綏遠，察哈爾實地去拍取外景，「女人」中耗費五千餘元搭製成功的一塲樓房付之一炬……這些全是其他公司所不肯犧牲的。現在史束山先生導演的有聲片「人之初」中，佈景也是非常的偉大，而這兩天拍取蘇州街道，小河，船埠……等幕戲的佈景，更屬偉大之至，因爲這些佈景全是預先由佈景師方沛霖先生到蘇州去把所要用到地方的景　用照相機攝取，歸來時所搭製的佈景便是依照片的一切而搭製，譬如蘇州的船與上海不同，就特的從蘇州租到兩只船來搬到公司開鑿的蘇州河裏，雖然有許多人對於藝華這樣的犧牲認爲是「笨作」，其實只有這樣的「笨作」，才可以得到優美的收獲，好萊塢各影片公司對於佈景就多是這樣的「笨作」，是則藝華公司有好萊塢的派頭了。</p>

<p>「殘淚」是兆華影業公司一九三五年的第一部處女作，此片抓取現實的社會失業作爲新穎的題材，　暴露社會的黑　面有大膽的描寫，在社會極度的動盪，失業問題嚴重化的今日，「殘戾」它給於靑年們有着一個極光明純正的指示！</p>
<p>這裏更發現了一個新童星—玉妮—天眞活潑可愛自然的表演，正引起了人們內心的共鳴！</p>

<p>傑姆勃郞却走開了之後，彭尼斯德就拉仕了雪倫的手道：「我和他們一起出來，你可不要生氣，因爲這是珠麗亞硬拖我來的。我不能使她太失面子了。但是他們夫妻這樣天天吵鬧，我亦不能和他們久處了，恐怕這件事妨礙了我天下最要得的……」他說到末了，聲音低柔了下去。一刻珠麗亞竟追了過來。她對着雪倫道：「哈　，雪倫，你坐到我們那面去吧。來吧……你和我……相同的地方很多……譬如說，我們兩個人可以講講湯梅的事……」雪倫低聲道：「珠麗亞，我想你還是回去吧。亨利過來了。」珠麗亞沒有法子，祇好無精打彩的走了回去。她臨走還回過頭來叫道：「湯枸，馬上就回來呀。」</p>
<p>彭尼斯德等珠麗亞一走，就對着雪倫道：「我們不要坐在這個地方了。我們去叫隻汽船，到我那恫地方去玩玩。」雪倫聽了，立即答應了。他們於是相將而出，等到傑姆聽完了電話回來，雪倫已經不知去向了。</p>
<p>不久彭尼斯德已經帶了雪倫到了他的別墅裏。那是一所很精巧的石頭房子，建築在北岸的斜坡上的。後面一座小山，風景極爲淸幽。臨水還有一所船房，是通屋外河道的。有許多管閒事的人，都常常揣度着，湯梅彭尼斯德怎麽得到這所房子，以及他怎樣維持這所房子的。他本來是僩竊光蛋，但是自從銀行倒閉之後，他巳更不如前，弄得一貧如洗了。他們到了那裏，進了屋子，雪倫將大衣卸了下來。彭尼斯德一面接過了雪倫的大衣，一面低下頭去，吻着她的香肩。他將火油燈點了起來，就陪著雪倫坐在一張矮沙發上。他握緊了她的手，柔聲說道：「我的一顆心，不知道能藏多少愛哩。」雪倫拍着他的手，一言不發，但她的眼睛却是秋波蕩漾，若不勝情似的。過了一同，她又說道：「湯梅，我總是那麼想，你對於柏德森他們，還是離開些好。她對於你簡直有些瘋狂了。常然，你是很爲難的。你要不是個君子人，恐怕早就不理睬她了……」忽然外面河上有一陣摩托的聲昔。彭尼斯德耳朶尖，聽見了，但是雪倫躺在沙發裏，眼睛半張半閑的很爲自在，她却沒有聽見。彭尼斯德站了起來道：「我去取些木頭。我們生個火取取煖。」他的神色，顯得很慌張，但是雪倫亦沒有看見他。她祇微微轉側了一下說道，「川不着生火。太晚了，我們不久就要走的。」彭尼斯德故意做着媚熊道：「生一個小小的火，好做一個紀念，等到我將來一個人在這裏看見火的時候，就會想起今晚的事的。」</p>
<p>他說着就出去取木頭去了。他臨走將一將唱片，放在留聲機上唱着，屋子裏立即就樂聲洋溢着。卻說彭尼斯德走到外面，一隻汽車船在他房子前面靠了岸。果然不出他的所料，那船中的人，正是珠麗亞柏德森。珠麗亞跳上了岸，就惡狠狠的對着彭尼斯德道：「我知道雪倫那各脫在這裏。我要和她理論理論，和她講講你是我什麼人。我實在及受不了了。」彭尼斯德攔住了她的路，拉住了她的衣服，那衣服是薄綢製的，立即撕破了。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c247">汽車駕駛人的心理條件 <a href="#c247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— 伯寗</p>
<p>汽車。許多人送以可怕的諢號呌「市虎」。因爲每天。每週。每月。汽車肇禍的案件在連續的發現。在汽車下送命的人在繼續地增加下去。無怪一般人要見他恐懼了。</p>
<p>但是。汽車的本身在日新月異地改善了。交通的設備也在積極地加以致良了。所留下來的問題是什麽呢？是人。是駕駛者的人選問題。就心理學的眼光看來。駕駛者祗少要免去下面的幾個消極方面的缺點。</p>
<p>（一）他不是色盲。患色盲的人。往往不能辨別各種色彩。就是最輕的紅綠盲。他們也不能辨別紅綠二色。我們知道目下交通上用的信號。大都是紅綠電燈。如果一個駕駛者而不能辨別紅綠。他將横衝直撞。還能遵守交通的規程嗎？辨別一個人有否色盲或紅綠盲是很簡便的。祗要用幾種色彩給他分別就可以了</p>
<p>（二）他不是散光。凡患有散光的人。眼球往往容易疲倦。視覺决計不能集中。而且眼前常常會發生幻覺。如果一個駕駛者。他的視覺不能集中。他的眼前常有幻覺。那不是很危險的事嗎。如果要檢騐一個人是否散光。那是很容易。祇要給他畫有綫條的圖試看。如果他旁邊的綫都能明白看見。他不是散光。如果他望上去有些綫淸楚。有些綫糊塗。那末他就靠不住了</p>
<p>（三）他沒有運動失調症。凡患運動失調症的人。往往自己控制不住自己的動作。平時他的動作還正常。有時候忽然會手足無措的錯亂起來。試思一個駕駛汽車的人。正在熱鬧的街市上行駛。忽然運動失調。那是够多麽危險呢？要檢騐一個人有否運動失調症。也是很容易的。祇要把他的二眼縛住。呌他二隻足尖幷立起來。如果他立得很穩定。那便沒有問題。如果他身子支持不住。似乎要倒下來。那便靠不住了。</p>
<p>（四）他沒有患自動反應。患自動反應的人。可以說是最危險了。如果他駕駛一輛車子在馬路上駛行。他看見別一輛車子。行得很快。他會身不由主地追上去。車子的肇禍。由於這一方面是很多的。患這一種毛病的人却很難檢査。祇有觀察他平日的行爲。看他是否安靜穩重。因爲患這種病的人。大都不能安閑地坐上一小時二小時的。</p>
<p>以上四種心理上的缺陷。對於駕駛者的阻碍是很嚴重的。未學駕駛的人。應先測量自己有否此種缺點。免致白學、已學會了的人。也應當自己測量。如果發現此種缺陷。寗願丢棄此種事業。免得浪費精力。反而發生惡果。至於考査汽車駕駛員的市政當局。和僱用駕駛員的人。對於上面的四個條件。那更應當鄭重考査呢。</p>

<p>一九三四年一年之中。美國各汽車廠之營業情形如何。關於全年汽車銷數之統計。此間尙未接到確實報吿。然自一九三四年一月至九月。前後九個月中。各廠銷車統計。早已發表。且在此九個月中。各廠銷車紀錄之增髙或低落。大勢已可確定全年之情狀矣。因先將九個月中各廠在美國新車註冊確數。先譯述如次。以吿本刋讀者。</p>
<h2>Page 28</h2>
<p>我人在未言九個月中各廠銷車總數之前。當先一述九月份各廠之銷車紀錄。以九月份言。美國地屈勞哀各汽車廠。共產汽車一四六，九三一輛。較之一九三三年九月份低落百分之七。而較之同年八月份低落百分之二四·二。然以九個月總數而言。則共銷車輛一，五六四，六九〇輛。較之一九三三年同時期九個月中。仍增加百分之二九，九。</p>
<p>九月份各廠銷車比數。雪佛蘭超過福特而獲得第一位。相差約一，〇〇〇輛。雪佛蘭之總數當四三，〇〇三輛。或佔全數百分之二九·三。而福特爲四一，九二九輛。佔全數百分之二八。五。第三爲順風牌。總共二四，五五一輛。依據各省新車註冊所計。則全美有三十二省由雪佛蘭高居首席。而福特佔第一位者共十六省。在哥侖比亞亦由福特領前。而順風牌則在各省皆佔第三位。惟在哥侖比亞追出雪佛蘭而佔第二位。共計超過雪蘭三十六輛。與福特亦相差甚近也。些三種前導之車輛。九月份佔各地註冊數百分之七四·五。八月份略髙。以個別而言。前十名所列次序。九月份與八月份並無變更。</p>
<p>奧斯摩別爾較道奇多一，五〇〇輛。而獲得第四位。寳塔克較別克超過一三一輛。佔第六位。地上飛與八月份所佔地位相同。司蒂倍克少地上飛一〇〇輛。佔第九位。而克雷斯勒則原佔第十位。奧斯摩別爾之總數。雖佔第四位。而以分省計。道奇佔第四位者有二十一省之多。奧斯摩別爾則僅有十九省。此外更有寳塔克與之競爭。佔第四位者亦有兩省。餘如別克佔四省。地上飛佔一省。皆獲第四位。</p>
<p>以一九三四年九個月中總數而言。福特仍佔首席。註册數較一九三三年增加二一一，五七九輛。正與事前一般汽車界之預料相同。三種低價汽車。福特。雪佛蘭。順風牌。銷數最旺。雪佛蘭之註册數較上年增加三九。四四九輛。而順風牌六一，九二三輛。三家總共此上年增加三一二，九二三輛。以百分法統計而言。則有若干車輛。更較上述三種爲多。如赫德遜九個月之註冊數共一五，八五一輛。而一九三三年同時期僅二，五三四輛。增加百分之五二五。五。地上飛增加百分之一一·八。納喜辣斐相併。較去年納喜單獨之數增加百分之一一九。辣斐雖爲上年度新出車輛。然在九月份中註册數亦居高十二位。其他如司蒂倍克九個月中比上年增加百分之一六五。奧斯摩別爾增加百分之九六。拉沙爾增加百分之三八·一。加蒂辣克增加百分之一八·四。葛萊亨增加百分之二七。別克增加百分之二七·四。福特之百分比增加百分之八九。一。雪佛蘭百分之一〇。順風牌百分之三二·一。</p>

<p>(Changsha) According to reports, after crossing the Wu River, Zhu and Mao's bandit gangs passed through areas south of Xifeng for a day and fled east towards Chaijiang. Our First Route Army's Li Column Commander Yunheng directed the 535th and 539th Regiments to besiege and suppress them in places such as the Heishen Temple, Sanheshi Chaoshui Field, Baozhai, and Yanglang Dam, about eighty miles north of Xifeng. They repeatedly inflicted heavy casualties and seized many spoils. The committee chairman sent a telegram to Li's brigade commending their loyalty and bravery in suppressing the bandits, awarding them a major merit, and awarding the officers and soldiers of the Huang and Mo Regiments of the brigade 4,000 yuan. (Central News Agency dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Changsha) Wang Jialie telegraphed that the Zhu and Mao bandit troops had been intercepted by our army in places such as Fenghuo Ao, Shitou Guan, Fangma Ping, and Tiechang between Xifeng and Xiuwen for several consecutive days, resulting in more than ten bloody battles. The bandits suffered thousands of casualties, and the intensity of the fighting was unprecedented. The remnants, with their fierce attacks blunted, dared not linger and fled through Kaiyang, rushing towards Yuqing and Shiqian, attempting to join forces with Xiao He's bandit gangs to eke out a living. Our Wu Qiwai, Zhou Hunyuan, and He Zhizhong's units are pursuing closely. Our Liu Jianxu's unit and Xu Yuanquan's unit have gathered in Tongren, Youyang, and Xiushan areas, preparing to deal a head-on blow. The military strength is exceptionally strong, and it will be extremely difficult for the bandits to join forces. They will soon be annihilated south of the Wu River. (Central News Agency dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Guiyang: Our army's Liang Division encountered the pseudo-Third Army's 10th and 23rd Regiments in the Shizishan area on the 5th. They launched a fierce attack, and the bandits, unable to withstand it, fled in several directions. It is estimated that more than 800 bandits were killed, more than 200 bandits were captured, more than 300 rifles were seized, and 16 light machine guns were seized. (Central News Agency dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Xue Yue telegraphed to Guangdong on the afternoon of the 6th, stating that our Wu Column encountered the pseudo-Third Army at Shizishan on the 5th. The battle lasted until dusk, and the bandits collapsed towards An. In this battle, more than 1,000 bandits were killed, more than 500 were captured, more than 800 rifles were seized, and 23 machine guns were seized. (Special dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Fourth Group Army's office in Guangdong received a telegram from Wang Zhezhi from Guizhou, stating that according to aerial reconnaissance, the bandits fleeing to Wengan and Pingyue were heading west towards the Da Xiaoyang Gu Long area of Longli on the 8th. (Special dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) It is now confirmed that after the failure of the Communist bandits' attempt to attack Guiyang, they are fleeing east, hoping to enter Hunan and join forces with He Long's bandit gang. Hunan Chairman He Jian is currently in Changsha, discussing countermeasures. Troops are currently being reinforced on the Hunan-Guizhou border to strengthen defenses. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>

<p>(Chongqing) Chairman Chiang telegraphed Liu Xiang, saying, "Liu, Chairman of Ba County, Jian: Now, as the great army is advancing to suppress bandits, all officers and soldiers should strive forward without hesitation. All county magistrates have a responsibility to defend their territory and should live or die with the city. They must not abandon their posts at every turn, thereby prolonging the bandit atmosphere and affecting military operations. It is hoped that you will strictly order all county magistrates under your jurisdiction that, in the future, when encountering bandit alarms, they should immediately supervise and lead local defense forces to defend to the death and await reinforcements. Anyone who dares to flee upon hearing the alarm or abandon the city will be dealt with by military law according to the law of desertion in the face of the enemy, and will be severely punished without leniency. This matter concerns the safety of the local area, and it is imperative to comply. Chiang Zhongzheng Qi (Central News Agency dispatch, 8th)"</p>

<p>(Hankou) Chiang, considering that the border areas of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces have long suffered from banditry, causing the people to be displaced and the fields to be barren, and that the bandit areas have been recovered one after another, ordered the three provincial governments on the 9th to quickly and properly plan for attracting and pacifying the people, ensuring that the fleeing people return to their hometowns as soon as possible, live in peace, and take measures to provide relief to avoid delaying spring plowing.

<p>(Beiping) Yin Rugeng went to Tianjin, accompanied by Tao Shangming and officials sent by the Hebei Provincial Government, to Caicun and Cangzhou to inspect the newly formed Peace Preservation Corps and to consult with Yu Xuezhong about the matter of the newly formed Peace Preservation Corps entering the war zone. After finishing the matters, he returned to Beiping last night and paid a visit to He Yingqin this morning to report. It is said that the original plan for the newly formed Peace Preservation Corps to enter the war zone was to be implemented on the 15th of this month. The Hebei Provincial Government has submitted the regulations for the organization of the Peace Preservation Corps and the regulations for the establishment of the Peace Preservation Headquarters to the Executive Yuan for approval. After receiving the instructions, preparations will be made for the vehicles and manpower needed for the departure. The actual departure date may be slightly delayed compared to the originally scheduled date. (Special dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The eastward troop rotation of the new Peace Preservation Corps has been slightly delayed due to the delay in the production of uniforms. It will be moved on the 15th. The 51st Army Headquarters has sent a letter to the Beining Railway Bureau to prepare vehicles. During the troop rotation, the Second General Corps will adopt the method of continuous entry. Each train will transport the troops past Tangshan. After the inspection personnel from both China and Japan verify that the number of firearms and personnel matches, they will be released and driven directly to the designated defense area to get off the train without stopping midway. The First General Corps will adopt the method of general mobilization, marching to Tongxian by land. After inspection, the entire team will arrive at Yutian and then go to the designated locations. (Special dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Hebei Provincial Government, regarding the eastward troop rotation of Zhang Qingyu and Zhang Yantian's troops, will temporarily use the name "Hebei Provincial Special Police Force" before the reorganization of the serial numbers and names of the Peace Preservation Corps is implemented. The two troops are larger, so their status will also be higher than that of Liu Zuozhou and Zhao Lei in the future. The Second General Corps is stipulated to set up district headquarters in Funing and Qian'an, and the First General Corps will set up a district headquarters each in Jixian and Zunhua. (Special dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Rugeng returned to Beiping from Tianjin on the evening of the 8th and paid a visit to He Yingqin on the morning of the 9th to report on the situation in the war zone. The original plan for the new Peace Preservation Corps to depart on the 15th has been slightly delayed because the organization method has not yet been determined. The organizational regulations of the Peace Preservation Headquarters have been drafted by the provincial government and submitted to the Ministry of Interior for review by the Executive Yuan. They will be announced and established as soon as they are approved. (Central News Agency dispatch, 9th)</p>

<p>(Chongqing) Chairman Chiang telegraphed all provincial governments on the 7th, ordering them to investigate wasteland and barren mountains, stating: "The Great Learning discusses governing peace, saying, 'With land, there is wealth.' Mencius discusses duties, using land reclamation and field management as the basis for rewards. Today, our country is in economic difficulties and the people are poor. Although there are many reasons, the failure to fully utilize land resources and the inability to unleash the people's power, leading to declining production and insufficient wealth, is the biggest problem. Investigating wasteland and planning for development are urgent matters that cannot be delayed. It is hoped that each provincial government will instruct the counties under its jurisdiction to separately investigate and list all areas within its borders with more than 500 mu of wasteland and barren mountains, as well as their geological suitability and the population of the surrounding areas, and submit them to the respective provincial governments for compilation and reporting to this chairman's Military Affairs Commission for review by June 6th of this year. There must be no delay. Zhongzheng Yu Mi Yu Yin (Central News Agency dispatch, 9th)"</p>

<p>(Kaifeng) The wind conditions have been unfavorable in recent days, and the water situation at Guantai is becoming increasingly dangerous. The work relief group is stepping up efforts to transport materials, but the breach-closing project is still stalled. The risk of breaching in Zhongmu and Zhengzhou, and the collapse of the Mian embankment in Wushe and the inundation in Tao, are worrying. The River Affairs Bureau has sent engineer Liu Jiaju to conduct a survey and urge various bureaus to strengthen the throwing of stones and reinforcement. (Central News Agency dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Kaifeng) The responsible parties of the Henan River Bureau began earthwork on the repaired embankments. Stonework cannot be transported because the work relief group has transferred all ships and vehicles to transport materials, and construction will still take time. A water conservancy expert said that Zhengzhou and Zhongmu on the south bank of the main canal and Wuzhi and Chenqiao on the north bank are all very dangerous. However, Henan Province has a lot of materials in storage. If defenses are not neglected, there may be no accidents. The danger is feared to be in the Hebei area. (Special dispatch, 9th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The financial authorities are cultivating good taxes and reducing expenditures on the one hand, and it is expected that new measures will be implemented in the 24th year of the Republic of China. Income tax has been set to be levied in the 24th year of the Republic of China.

<h3 id="e20">Spring Relief and Rural Aid <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>The weather has been abnormal this year. Winter was warm and turned cold. Spring crops have had greatly reduced harvests. The harsh winter has just passed, and the spring famine has come again. The impoverished farmers in disaster areas are in dire straits. According to recent news, famine victims in the counties north of the Jiangsu province, have been swarming wealthy households to seize food. Even Wuxi, which is known for its prosperity, has repeatedly had rice-grabbing incidents this year. The difficulty of food for the people can be seen here. Now that the spring plowing season has arrived, farmers everywhere need capital. Seeds, fertilizers, farm implements, and plowing cattle are indispensable, but the average impoverished farmer is unable to afford the cost of these during these difficult times. However, without preparation, where will this year's harvest come from? Therefore, for impoverished farmers, this is truly a matter of life and death. For the country, this is not only directly related to the issue of food for the people, but also has an indirect impact on social security.</p>
<p>Therefore, people from all levels of society feel the importance of spring relief. Various efforts are now being made for spring relief matters. In addition to approving a relief reserve fund of 50 million yuan, the government has recently reached an agreement with Xu Shiying, chairman of the Relief Committee, to allocate 200,000 yuan from the government as funding for the purchase of seeds, which will be distributed to farmers in disaster-stricken provinces for planting. In addition, provincial governments will be responsible for half of the purchase of seeds, which will be loaned to farmers without interest, to be repaid after the autumn harvest. This kind of relief and loan relief method is beneficial to farmers and the issue of food for the people and is a necessary measure for aiding the countryside.</p>
<p>However, providing relief is not an easy task. Our country's past disaster relief efforts cannot be said to have lacked effort in newspaper publicity, and the relief methods cannot be said to have been inadequate. However, the number of disaster victims who have been able to obtain real benefits is actually small. The reason for this is that the disaster investigations are insufficiently detailed. Without detailed investigations, it is difficult to avoid the abuses of indiscriminate or missed distribution. This leads to those waiting for relief not being able to get relief, while cunning local people can use their skills to embezzle from it. Therefore, in providing spring relief, it is also necessary to first understand the actual situation in various places and implement appropriate measures based on local conditions, ensuring that all relief funds can reach the real disaster victims. This is something that those providing relief must pay close attention to.</p>
<p>However, disaster relief is essentially a short-term solution for aiding the countryside. Given the frequency of disasters and the vastness of disaster areas in our country in recent years, relying solely on relief is not only a drop in the bucket and of little help, but also a great waste of limited national funds on passive relief, which is not a once-and-for-all solution. Therefore, in addition to necessary relief, various active and effective methods should be sought, such as (1) bank loans to the countryside, (2) the establishment of credit cooperatives and agricultural lending offices in various places, so that farmers can borrow when they have urgent needs, and (3) the establishment of granaries to regulate food supplies. All of these must be planned and implemented in normal times to promote the improvement of the rural economy. If the rural economy can gradually improve, then the disasters that can be prevented by human effort will naturally not break out so frequently again. In addition, water conservancy matters must also be actively promoted, as water conservancy is a necessary measure for preventing droughts and floods, and it also greatly helps to increase agricultural production. In short, both short-term and long-term solutions must be planned and considered in order for farmers in disaster-stricken areas to have hope for recovery, and for the rural economy to gradually improve.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Summary of Talks between President Wang and Associated Press Reporter: Improving Sino-Japanese Relations Should Begin with Adjusting Other Relations; Japanese Government Has Not Expressed Opposition to International Loans; International Loans to China Are Still Under Discussion; US Silver Policy Affects Chinese Finance and Industry <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) On the second of this month, Mr. Maurice of the Associated Press met with President Wang, who also serves as Foreign Minister. Mr. Maurice then published a statement in the "Ta Mei Wan Bao" (Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury), but the content was inaccurate. The "Ta Mei Wan Bao" and "North China Daily News" (字林西報) voluntarily made corrections. Now, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued the following key points of the conversation that day: (1) Mr. Maurice asked if Sino-Japanese relations were improving. President Wang replied that this was indeed the case. Mr. Maurice asked if the Northeast Provinces (東四省, Manchuria) issue had been resolved. President Wang replied that both sides still maintained their original positions on this issue. Mr. Maurice asked if the so-called improvement was not concrete. President Wang replied that to improve Sino-Japanese relations, it should begin with adjusting other relations. (2) Mr. Maurice asked if Japan opposed China taking out international loans. President Wang replied that the Japanese government had not expressed such opposition. Mr. Maurice said that Japanese newspapers had published dissenting opinions. President Wang said that the Japanese public might have such opinions, but it was unrelated to the government. (3) Mr. Maurice asked about the progress of international loans. President Wang replied that progress was slow. Mr. Maurice asked the reason for this. President Wang replied that single loans often involve many economic entanglements, while joint loans often have differing opinions among various countries, so it is still under discussion. (4) Mr. Maurice asked about China's opinion on the silver issue. President Wang replied that the US silver policy not only adversely affected China's finances but also caused huge losses to China's agriculture, industry, and commerce. The above were the key points of the conversation that day. The content previously published by the Associated Press that differed from the above were Mr. Maurice's personal opinions.

Not only the provincial budgets must be determined, but especially the county budgets must be determined. Once the budgets are determined, the tax revenue can be organized. In order to urge the provinces to prepare budgets, it is planned to send personnel to the provinces according to their respective situations. (2) Organizing the national land tax. In our country, the land tax has always been controlled by the wealthy, and the burden on the poor has increased. Now, the provinces have been notified to initially handle land declarations. Two or four counties will be selected in each province to conduct pilot projects. After the pilot projects are successful, the average land tax rate will be adjusted across the province, reducing the original land tax levied, and the surplus will never be put into the provincial treasury, so as to directly reduce the people's burden. Currently, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, Anhui, Shandong, Hebei, Hubei, and other provinces and cities are handling land declarations. The headquarters has dispatched special personnel to the provinces to urge progress. (3) Organizing other tax revenue, such as broker taxes, license taxes, business taxes, etc. Currently, the tax rates for broker taxes and other taxes levied in the provinces are not unified, and the methods are inconsistent, some of which are harsh and miscellaneous, and should also be organized. The above three points will be implemented this year. (Special dispatch, 9th)</p>

If it is too late to purchase them, it is allowed to transfer them to extremely poor loans. The methods will be drafted by the Civil Affairs, Finance, and Construction departments, and the county governments must complete the handling within ten days and report to the Civil Affairs, Finance, and Construction departments for verification. The work relief funds that are transferred will be the responsibility of the counties to replenish after the autumn harvest. (Central News Agency dispatch, 9th)</p>

<p>(London) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson harshly criticized the debate in the British House of Lords regarding Britain's role as a mediator between China and Japan, saying that Sino-Japanese relations are gradually improving and there is no need for outsiders to overstep their authority. Today, The Times published an editorial refuting this, saying that Foreign Minister Hirota's dispensing with the need for representatives from various countries to participate when hosting Puyi will surely be appreciated by various governments. But as far as Britain is concerned, Japan's tactics have been offset by the unwarranted attacks of its official spokesperson on Britain's China policy. The spokesperson would benefit from carefully studying the remarks of British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Stanhope. Hirota knows full well that what the British government welcomes most is a good and lasting understanding between China and Japan. Since Hirota has this understanding, the arguments of his representative are all the more incomprehensible. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3 id="e66">British Policy: Harmony is the First Priority; Proposes a Broad Plan for European Security; Does Not Blame Germany's Past, But Observes its Future; Approves of the Defensive Alliance between France, Russia, and Czechoslovakia <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>(London) Britain has begun drafting a broad plan to maintain peace in Europe. The Cabinet has decided that Britain's policy will be based on harmony. The Cabinet resolved as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Approve the military defense treaty between France, Russia, and Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>(2) Join Italy in urging France to allow Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria to rearm.</p>
<p>(3) Advise France and Italy to seek prudence when opposing Germany's rearmament, not blaming the past, but taking the future as a viewpoint.</p>
<p>The Cabinet also decided to increase the power of Foreign Secretary Simon and Lord Privy Seal Eden to conclude treaties, which proves the importance of the Stresa Conference. Prime Minister MacDonald will also attend in person, and French Prime Minister Flandin and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will also attend the meeting. The world is particularly surprised by Britain's legal participation in the French-Russian agreement, because the world has always known that Britain only supports the idea of defensive mutual assistance. Britain will not take drastic measures against Germany's violation of the treaty and rearmament as its policy for participating in the Stresa Conference, and will advise the French and Italian representatives to tell them that this is a new era, and they should take the premise of what dangers lie ahead, and cannot base their actions on Germany's pre-war mistakes. As for the rearmament of Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria, Britain has agreed with Italy that the countries that signed the Treaty of Saint-Germain should allow the three countries to rearm as a reward for their compliance with the treaty. (National Telegraph dispatch, 9th)</p>

<p>(London) The decision of Britain, France, and Italy to have their leaders and foreign ministers participate in the Stressa Conference was particularly welcomed by Parisian figures, who felt that the talks could be more authoritative as a result. However, although German newspapers claimed that Britain had decided against implementing an encirclement of Germany through the League of Nations, both Paris and Berlin felt that Britain's attitude was difficult to fathom. It is reported that French Foreign Minister Laval will propose at the Stressa Conference the use of Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, in order to stipulate the obligation to implement immediate measures in the event of aggression. (Note: Article 16 of the Covenant stipulates that if a member of the League engages in war against another member in disregard of the Covenant, all other members shall immediately sever all commercial or financial relations with it. The Council of the League shall be responsible for recommending to the governments concerned that the members of the League contribute land, sea, and air forces to form an army to maintain the implementation of the League of Nations Covenant.) It is also reported that Laval will propose that in addition to Britain, France, and Italy, the Little Entente countries and Soviet Russia should also join this kind of convention. Furthermore, Laval will earnestly declare that this agreement should be open for signature by all countries, including Germany and Poland. It is generally believed that if Mussolini of Italy is aware that this plan can be implemented, he will accept it, but it is feared that although Britain may agree in principle, it will refuse to participate.

Lord Cranborne, Secretary to the Lord Privy Seal Eden, and Mr. Strang, Director of League of Nations Affairs at the Foreign Office, will accompany them. It is noted that Lord Cranborne and Mr. Strang recently accompanied Eden on visits to Russia and Poland. (Havas, 9th)</p>

<p>(Rome) The local prestigious newspapers have expressed welcome upon hearing the news that British Prime Minister MacDonald has decided to attend the Stressa Conference in person, stating that it will enhance the importance of the conference and facilitate the adoption of concrete decisions, and that MacDonald's arrival is sufficient to demonstrate the British government's ability to fulfill its obligations. (Guomin, 9th)</p>
<p>Mussolini Firmly Insists That Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria Be Allowed to Expand Their Armaments</p>
<p>(Rome) Political circles here are greatly pleased to learn that British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Simon will personally attend the Stressa Conference. Political circles believe that if Germany's ambitions are to be curbed, Britain, France, and Italy must form a solid common front in the upcoming conference. However, several parties still harbor doubts about Britain's attitude. Various newspapers have severely criticized Britain for wanting to remain outside of European affairs, not taking on any obligations. There is no doubt that Mussolini will firmly insist during the conference that Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria should be allowed to expand their armaments to resist the "danger from the North." (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Baldwin's Speech: Britain Does Not Want War</p>
<p>(London) Lord President of the Council Baldwin stated in a speech at the Lantrindyte Free Church Congress today that he sometimes feels as if he is in a madhouse. All nations are now not taking the path of peace, but moving towards the most dangerous path, fearing that it may lead to war. At the end of the European War, many people in Britain and other countries believed that nationalism, self-determination, and democracy were the keys to a new paradise, but this key is not working, and paradise is still out of reach. One remedy has now proven to be more harmful than the disease, and that is economic nationalism. This ideology has spread like wildfire, and some have tried to cure this disease with the harsh medicine of dictatorship. But these people are now walking around Europe as if they were in the sick ward of a mental hospital. Today, it is a big mistake to believe that the Treaty of Versailles can change the nature of countries. No matter what changes Germany undergoes, they are superficial. If we cannot change Germany's purpose, then what we consider to be very important is considered by them to be irrelevant. Baldwin concluded by saying that Britain absolutely does not want war. If it is necessary to make aggressors understand that war is unacceptable in order to prevent war, then Britain will work with other countries in Europe to prevent aggression from happening. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>London Newspapers Comment: A Glimpse of Policy</p>
<p>(London) All major newspapers today commented on the Stressa Conference. The Times stated that Britain does not want to take on more European responsibilities, and British diplomats must devote their full efforts to inviting Germany to rejoin the League. The Daily Telegraph reported that no matter what regional pacts are debated, the claim that the security of the group is based on Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant should occupy a major position in the discussion. The Daily News stated that the only reliable thing is to consolidate the peace formed by the entire mechanism of the League of Nations. The Evening News requested that Britain should unreservedly participate in group actions to resist any country that attempts to change the map of Europe by force. The Morning Post stated that if anything can make Germany feel that it has fallen into a self-imposed state of isolation and despair, it is Britain's willingness to take the lead. We must abandon fruitless bickering and resolutely participate in safeguarding peace with the only method that can ensure success. The Daily Sketch stated that if Britain refuses to join the disputes in Europe and maintains peace for its own people, it will be respected by everyone. The Daily Mail called for no deals with Russia, no encirclement of Germany, and immediate construction of the strongest air force. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Broad Security Plan: Does Not Want to Exclude Germany</p>
<p>(London) Parliament predicts that the Cabinet plans to submit to the Stressa Conference a broad plan for mutual air assistance, as Britain's contribution to the security system. This plan is based on limiting the air force strength of various countries. The scope of the so-called security system must be broader than the Eastern European regional pact. Although Britain's attitude to be adopted at the Stressa Conference regarding this matter is currently uncertain, the so-called broad plan may aim to encompass all countries that have participated in the war, without excluding any one. A question arises here, that is, if Germany excludes itself, what will other countries do? The general impression is that if Germany can join this plan, Britain is prepared to recognize its full equality of military rights in exchange. However, the Stressa Conference may not make any decisions regarding this matter before a conference is held by all relevant countries. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>Italian-French Solidarity: Difficulties Will Eventually Be Overcome</p>
<p>(Paris) On the eve of the opening of the Stressa Conference, newspapers generally believe that the situation is satisfactory. Le Petit Parisien reported, "There is no doubt that the Stressa Conference will make some decisions. The German side often tries to divert the attention of the British, French, and Italian sides. The authorities of the British, French, and Italian sides are well aware of this and will not be fooled." L'Action Française believes that "If the Stressa Conference issues a declaration reiterating the principles of the Locarno Treaty, it is expected that Britain will not object, because the Rhine is still a point of anxiety in Britain's continental policy." L'Écho de Paris believes that German leader Hitler's proposed bilateral pacts (meaning he does not support multilateral pacts) may not be valued by British Foreign Secretary Simon. "If Mussolini of Italy and French Foreign Minister Laval can unite with each other, then the mutual aid treaty plan, despite encountering difficulties at the last minute, can still be overcome." The tone of Le Matin also expressed optimism, saying, "Britain's attitude tends to be reserved, which can be seen in the repeated declarations of its cabinet members, but if the Italian and French governments can maintain a firm policy, Britain may change course. France's firm attitude has had a direct impact on British policy, and this is not the first time." (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>Soviet Prominent Political Commentator: Reviews Pan-European Convention</p>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet prominent political commentator Radek has an article published in Izvestia, in which Radek stated that the daily news received regarding the preparations for Stressa proves that its future is extremely pessimistic. Radek mentioned the recent rounds of negotiations, saying, "Politics should be based on information, but we can only examine the situation and inform each other until a new world war breaks out. The issue of Eastern European security is primarily related to the Eastern European countries. Since the Stressa Conference does not have their participation, the convention cannot be stipulated by the conference. Considering the Soviet Union's relationship to this issue, a certain decision must be effective only with its participation. The news that has been circulating recently among the great powers regarding the Eastern European regional mutual assistance convention is really confusing. According to some British and French newspapers, a reliable French opinion believes that since Germany and Poland are unwilling to sign this convention, the Eastern Convention will be abandoned and replaced by a pan-European convention. This convention is directly based on the League of Nations Covenant, but it needs to be made more specific."</p>
<p>Radek further reviewed the pan-European convention plan, saying, "Fifteen years of experience have proven that countries have no power to take on a responsibility to provide assistance to an unknown country in an unknown situation and an unknown event without prior knowledge. Has the difficulty encountered by the Eastern Convention changed this experience? If a regional convention is not easy to achieve, then it will be even less likely to realize a system in which all countries take on certain obligations in the event of war. This has been proven by experience. The claim by Poland and Germany that they are unwilling to agree to the Eastern Convention is not convincing, because Germany and Poland cannot bear any definite obligations to several countries with obvious and clear contradictions, and they claim that they can take action against aggressor countries in distant territories and in unknown events? Those who draft this universal convention plan, which includes all countries, aim to keep the Eastern Convention in useless international negotiations for a long time, and that is why the German press supports this plan, but this is not only related to the issue of Germany and Poland. A universal convention that seeks to strengthen the obligations undertaken by various countries is absolutely impossible without Britain's signature. However, Britain is absolutely unwilling to take on more obligations on the continent. If someone requires the British government to be clearly responsible for providing assistance to European countries that are being invaded, they will definitely refuse. At the same time, if their obligations are not clearly stipulated, then they will be of little help in increasing security. On the contrary, this kind of vague obligation can have harmful results, because countries threatened by danger will be softened, thereby helping the aggressor countries complete their goals. Therefore, this universal agreement cannot be accepted. I predict that after several months of diplomatic negotiations, the drafters of this plan will find themselves in the same position and encountering the same difficulties as they are today. The only difference is that those who are willing to start a war have had more time to prepare." (TASS, 8th)</p>

Increase alarm bells to warn the public and expand the fire brigade, etc. The expenses are borne by the government, and each city must also bear one-tenth of the total expenses. Various equipment must be inspected on a regular basis. Those who do not comply with the inspection will be fined 16 to 110 francs for the first time, and if they commit the offense again, they will be fined 200 francs, or imprisoned for one month.

<p>Munich: At a time when the European situation is undergoing drastic changes, German war hero Ludendorff will celebrate his 70th birthday tomorrow. The German military and civilians took the opportunity to offer congratulations, which is of profound significance. Minister of National Defense Blomberg and Commander-in-Chief of the Army Fritsch arrived here tonight in preparation for personally visiting Ludendorff's villa in the town of Dötzing tomorrow morning to celebrate his birthday. On that day, a Munich infantry regiment will parade in front of Ludendorff's house, and double sentries will stand guard in front of the veteran's house to show their respect.

<h3 id="e71">Danzig Election Not Prosperous: The National Socialist Party Did Not Achieve Its Ambitions; The Free City System Cannot Be Changed; Looked at the Victory of the Saar with Disappointment <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Warsaw: The temporary results of the Danzig City Council election, the distribution of seats is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>National Socialist Party: 43 seats, Social Democratic Party: 12 seats</p>
<p>Catholic Center Party: 10 seats, Communist Party: 2 seats</p>
<p>German National People's Party: 3 seats, Polish Party: 2 seats, totaling 72 seats in the City Council. The National Socialist Party won 43 seats, while the opposition party won 29 seats. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The National Socialist Party is quite disappointed with the results of the Danzig City Council election. The National Socialist Party originally hoped to win at least two-thirds of the seats, so that the opposition party would not be able to do anything, and the system of the Free City of Danzig could be changed at will. In view of the special circumstances of Danzig and the relationship between Germany and Poland, Germany must abide by the procedures stipulated in the Danzig constitution and should not occupy Danzig by force. If the National Socialist Party had won two-thirds of the seats, it could have declared Danzig's merger with Germany in accordance with legal procedures, rendering the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles regarding the Free City of Danzig practically invalid. However, although the National Socialist Party has won six more seats than before in this election, it is still four seats short of the two-thirds majority. Therefore, German newspapers only stated that the number of votes won by the National Socialist Party in Danzig has greatly increased, and did not celebrate the victory of this election. This is quite noteworthy, because some people in the National Socialist Party generally believe that the significance of this election transcends the scope of the city of Danzig. If a great victory had been achieved in Danzig, a precedent would have been set for holding referendums in Memel and even in Austria. But this is not the case now. The election in Danzig failed to achieve its goals, so it is appropriate that the National Socialist Party is greatly disappointed. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The political result of the election in Danzig at present is that the National Socialist Party failed to obtain a two-thirds majority, so it failed to amend the constitution of the Free City, and the opposition party can prevent the National Socialist Party's plan to establish a dictatorship. However, people generally do not believe that the prestige of the National Socialist Party and the people's welcome to the party have declined in Germany proper, because the economic situation of Danzig is far less prosperous than that of Germany, and the local National Socialist Party organs are deeply criticized by the opposition party for their favoritism. Although, the National Socialist Party leaders tried their best to win, but to no avail. Compared with the victory in the Saar region, it is even more disappointing. This is still the first time in the history of the National Socialist Party. (Guomin, 8th)</p>

<p>Brussels: The State Council met today to discuss the financial and economic situation. They are quite satisfied with the recent capital flow situation. Since the establishment of the new cabinet, the total amount of capital flowing into Belgium has exceeded 2 billion Belgian francs. In other words, the capital that flowed out in January of this year has now returned to Belgium. The prices of various government bonds continue to rise, forcing the government to release huge amounts of bonds to meet public demand. Due to the increase in government bond prices, the government may implement interest rate swaps in the near future. In addition, the increase in savings deposits is also a welcome phenomenon. Savings have increased by 50 million Belgian francs in the past two weeks. The most important issue currently being studied by the government is whether to respect or abandon gold clauses in private contracts. The government will announce its decision tomorrow. It is estimated that most debts will abandon gold clauses, but bondholders of loans from the United States will still be repaid principal and interest in accordance with the gold standard within one year.

<p>— Special Correspondent Geng Ya</p>
<p>My First Encounter with Robbers</p>
<p>As the sky was beginning to lighten, the car drove out of Dingcheng. After twenty-four kilometers, we reached Hongtuyao. There were dozens of households of residents, with piles of wheat stacked like green mushrooms from afar. The clouds were dim, the morning sun was shining through them, and the cold wind was biting to the bone. We drove for seven or eight kilometers on the plain, then began to ascend Huajialing. The passengers slowly took the shortcut, panting and their legs aching. The car swerved left and right, sometimes going up and then retreating. If wooden chocks were not used to block the wheels, it would have rolled straight into the deep ravine. Upon reaching the high ridge, we got into the car and looked around. Mountains and valleys were laid out beneath our feet. White clouds swirled around the car, with small snowflakes gathering in the clouds, hitting our faces softly, as if there was something and nothing at all. After passing a high mountain pass, we traveled along the ridge, with deep ravines and dangerous cliffs on both sides. The fog became thicker, and the car drove slower. I felt uneasy in my heart, as if walking on the edge of a deep abyss. Suddenly, two cars came towards us, their horns blaring loudly, faintly heard from within the fog, and then quickly disappearing into the clouds again. The passengers all huddled and shrunk their necks, covered in snow. We expected the east side of the ridge to be a silver world, as we had already seen the signs. Huajialing is one hundred kilometers long. After traveling about a third of the way, we indeed entered a silver world. The clouds and fog were still thick, and it was still snowing. Everything, from trees to grass, was transformed into silver by the clouds and fog, which was completely different from the snow-covered trees on the plains, with only a few pear blossoms blooming. Just as we were enjoying the snow scenery, we suddenly heard two "bang" sounds, and the car stopped abruptly. At first, we suspected that a tire had burst, but then we heard shouts of "Get down, get down!" We then saw two people standing four or five steps in front of the car, wearing long gowns and short jackets, with robes on their shoulders. Each of them held a pistol and fired into the air. They continued to shout at the passengers, "Get down quickly! We are just borrowing some travel expenses from you." The passengers were shocked to learn that they had encountered robbers and were all terrified. The truck had no windows, so everyone jumped out one after another, their feet heavy and their eyes averted, staring in shock. Another three robbers, all dressed as travelers, but without guns, only carrying walking sticks, ordered everyone to quickly line up and hand over their valuables one by one. The robbers took them and threw them into bags, the sound of silver coins hitting each other ringing in the air. The robbers even felt the clothes of those who were more richly dressed. A missionary repeatedly begged, "You (referring to the robbers) are robbing the rich to help the poor, I am acting on behalf of heaven!" The robbers ignored him and robbed him of his silver in the end.</p>
<p>I was standing at the end of the line. Although I had brought some travel expenses with me, they were all ten-yuan banknotes and small denominations. Silver coins were too heavy, so I had put them in my briefcase. Also, because the map had fallen into the water last night, I had wrapped the briefcase in my luggage this morning. Therefore, I had no silver coins with me at this time to deal with the situation. If I wanted to take out the banknotes, I would have to move the whole amount, otherwise it would be better not to give anything, and perhaps I could be spared. Thinking of this, the robbers had already searched up to me. In my panic, I did not know what to do. I slightly patted my breast pocket to show that I had nothing. The robber reached into my pocket and mistook my diary for a wallet. He pulled it out and looked at it, then handed it back. I had just returned from outside the Guan (Shanhaiguan Pass), wearing a "locomotive hat," an old cloth leather robe, and not a penny in my pocket. The robbers did not suspect me, so I was unexpectedly spared. Then, one of the robbers jumped onto the car, threw the luggage to the ground, and ordered everyone to step back so they could unpack and inspect it.</p>
<p>Forced by the robbers, everyone lowered their heads and stepped back. Those who had silver coins in their luggage were all anxious at this point. Just as the situation was critical, the truck of the Gansu Provincial Anti-Opium Committee rushed from the snow and fog. A passenger ran to inform them that there were robbers. The three soldiers in the truck immediately got out with live ammunition. Seeing that the incoming vehicle had guns, the robbers shouted to each other to quickly escape down the slope. The snow was deep and the fog was thick, and they disappeared in an instant. The other cars continued to arrive, but did not pursue them, firing dozens of shots into the air. The valley echoed with loud sounds. After a while, there was barking from dogs about two or three miles down the mountain. It was likely that there were villages, and the robbers had already escaped.</p>
<p>About five or six bags of luggage were thrown down from the car, but only two were unpacked. A pair of new "Suzhou jiawowo" shoes (a type of shoe with a thick sole of two inches, black woolen edges, and red woolen faces, specially worn in winter to keep warm) and a pair of glasses were taken away. Although my luggage was also thrown to the ground, it was not unpacked. Otherwise, my briefcase or camera would have been snatched away. Assuming that the robbers would not attack again, we packed up and continued on. Although several people had their travel expenses stolen, the robbers did not hurt anyone, which was fortunate. I had previously passed through a mountain on the border of Gansu and Ningxia and Xingxing Gorge on the border of Gansu and Xinjiang, and although I had heard about robbers twice, I had not actually encountered a dangerous situation. This encounter at Huajialing can be said to be my first. Life's journey is never smooth. Looking back on it now, it is quite interesting.</p>
<p>After a hurried drive through the snow, we arrived at a village also named Huajialing. According to the local people, "The place where we were robbed is called Haojia Qu Liangzi. Shajiawan, thirty miles to the east, also often experiences robberies." After passing Shajiawan, the terrain became very steep, but fortunately, nothing happened. We traveled along the ridge, and it was already night. The snow reflected the light, and the sky was dark gray. We circled down a steep slope. The first car had people treading through the snow to find the way, while the cars behind followed the tracks slowly. We arrived at Jieshipu at 11:00 PM and stayed overnight. The journey was one hundred and fifty kilometers. There was a company of soldiers stationed in the village, with over seventy households of residents. We departed early the next morning at sunrise. After passing Qijia Mountain, we traveled fifteen kilometers to Jingning County. The shops were lined up neatly, and the population was prosperous. After the snow, the earth houses and dead branches were all transformed into jade trees and jade buildings. The sunlight shone brightly, like rain. The car stopped for two hours to pick up new passengers. Taking advantage of the time, I visited County Magistrate Xu Junchong, intending to inquire about the local situation. I waited in the reception room and saw a sign on the wall that read, "By strict order of the Suiyuan Office, the county government must not provide the army with any miscellaneous services..." But the messenger handed my name card inside, and then led a quartermaster in. I secretly guessed that this rule was ineffective. After a while, the messenger came out and suddenly asked me, "Did you just arrive here from Lanzhou by car?" I answered yes. He then said, "The county magistrate has gone out." Later, I returned to the station and learned that Mr. Yang, who was traveling with me, had been robbed of everything on the way and had given the county magistrate three yuan as a gift. No wonder my subsequent visit caused a misunderstanding and I was turned away. At 1:00 PM, the car continued eastward.</p>

<p>Hankou Communication - Xu Xiangqian's remnant bandits, after fleeing from Southern Shaanxi back to Northern Sichuan, launched a full-scale attack on Guangyuan and Zhaohua, but were repelled by the combined forces of Deng Xihou and Tian Songyao. Unexpectedly, Cangxi was poorly defended, and the bandit troops secretly crossed the Jialing River, continuing to expand into Western Sichuan. Upon receiving the report in Guizhou, Chairman Chiang immediately dismissed Tian Songyao from his post and increased troop reinforcements to suppress the bandits. The various armies engaged in suppression have been winning battles in recent days. In addition to Wang Zanxu's Fifth Route Army having occupied Southern City and advancing victoriously towards Suining, Deng's army on the eastern bank of the Fuling River has also engaged in fierce battles with the bandits. Deng has built bunkers and strengthened fortifications along the Fuling River. The rear troops are completely concentrated in Mianyang, while the front lines are guarding Zitong, preventing the bandits from advancing west. On the 5th, Xu's bandits, with a large force, advanced from Maying Temple and Wulianyi towards the D묘ao Mountain east of Zitong, engaging in a fierce battle with the Huang Division and Che Cheng regiments of Deng's army for a full day and night. The bandits suffered heavy casualties and retreated to Maying Temple and Wulianyi. Currently, Hu Zongnan's division has recovered Ningqiang and is stationed in Guangyuan, effectively coordinating with the Chen Dingxun and Yang Xiuchun divisions of Deng's army, agreeing on a date to jointly suppress the bandits. Upon investigation, the bandits' westward escape was due to being besieged on all sides, fleeing desperately without any plan. They are now trapped in a four-sided encirclement. Not only is Western Sichuan secure, but the elimination of the remnant bandits is also possible. (8th)</p>
<h3 id="e109">Wuhu Meat Industry Strike; Opposing 30% Surtax for Compulsory Education <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu Communication - Funds for compulsory education in Wuhu were previously stipulated to be surcharged on slaughter taxes. Since the great flood in 1931, the slaughterers have been unable to pay according to the regulations due to poor business, and the Meat Industry Association has recognized and paid 1,000 yuan annually. Recently, the education authorities, believing that the compulsory education funds were still severely inadequate, decided through the finance and education departments to order Wuhu County to stop the recognized payment method and instead surcharge 30% of the regular tax (i.e., 1.2 cents surcharge on every 4 cents of regular tax). However, the meat industry believes that it is a small-scale operation that can barely make a living, and the value of a pig is only about 10 yuan, while the taxes and levies they bear include 4 cents for slaughter tax, 1.6 cents for livestock tax, and 0.6 cents for meat levy. Now, with such a heavy surcharge, it amounts to more than 60/1000th of the business tax. At a time when excessive taxes and levies are being abolished, and the Provincial Tax Supervision Committee has been newly established, they are demanding to continue the previous practice of total payment by the association and to withdraw the order to surcharge 30%. The county government believes that this is a decision made by the provincial government and is uniform across all counties, so it cannot be changed easily and is difficult to approve. Therefore, the entire meat industry went on strike today and petitioned the central government according to the law, hoping to achieve their goal. It has been reported that Zhang Yuanda and Ma Wushan, two business owners, have been detained by the local tax bureau and sent to the county government for custody because they are unable to recognize and pay the surcharge.

<p>On the 5th, an unidentified male corpse was discovered by the riverbank in the Luye Tang area of Shengxiang, Tianma Mountain. The corpse was about thirty years old, wearing a dark blue lined robe, dark blue wool trousers, and a yellow shirt. He had a pair of plain glasses and a box of cigarettes in his possession, with a cigarette held between his fingers. There was a knife wound to the forehead, throat, bridge of the nose (two wounds), and back. There were three knife wounds to the body. The death was gruesome, clearly a revenge killing. However, no one knew the name of the corpse. The local village police reported it to the Tianma Mountain Public Security Station and then to the Songjiang Bureau, and sent a letter to the County Court Prosecutor's Office. On the 9th, the prosecutor led officials and police to hire a boat to go to the countryside to conduct an inspection in order to thoroughly investigate the matter.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Suzhou; Elder Gentleman Fei Zhongshen Passes Away <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Fei Zhongshen (Shuwei), a resident of Taohuawu in Suzhou, was a gentleman from Wujiang. He was 52 years old. During the reign of Yuan Shikai, Fei served as a Censor. His eldest daughter-in-law is Yuan Shikai's granddaughter. Fei was recently deeply stimulated by the issue of Wujiang County's collection of outstanding taxes and suddenly suffered a stroke a few days ago. Despite extensive treatment by famous doctors, he died at 9:00 PM on the 8th. The coffin will be sealed on the 11th. Fei was usually enthusiastic about social welfare and charitable causes and was the founder of the Suzhou Electric Power Plant. Therefore, the local people deeply regret his passing.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Robbers Encountered on Return Boat from Watching a Play <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>In the eighteenth du, fifth qu, of Taiping Bridge Township in the rural area of Suzhou, farmers from the entire village performed plays for two days on the sixth and seventh days [of the month] to thank the gods for preventing blight. Six or seven villagers from nearby Wu Ta Township traveled by boat to Taiping Bridge Township to watch the plays. On the seventh, on their return journey in the evening, as they passed the Big Pond, they encountered a sudden downpour. Suddenly, a robber boat appeared, carrying seven or eight robbers, each armed with guns, who intercepted them and robbed them. They were robbed of jewelry and silver dollars worth approximately one hundred yuan and fled towards Changshu. Furthermore, Wang Bao, a housewife who owned a sundry goods store in the fifth tu of the eleventh du of Fengqiao Township, was robbed some days ago. The robbers burned Wang Bao's lower body with fire, and she died of severe injuries on the afternoon of the eighth due to the fire poisoning her heart. The local prosecutor's office sent personnel on the ninth to examine the body.</p>
<h3 id="e113">National Goods Commercial Venue Postpones Opening <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The construction of the National Goods Commercial Venue of the North Bureau in Suzhou City has already been completed. It is a three-story steel-and-concrete building, costing 140,000 yuan. The commercial venue had already leased [the building] to Mr. Zhang, the manager of the Yangtze Hotel in Shanghai, to open a highest standard hotel that absolutely rejects gambling, prostitution, and opium. Negotiations are currently underway.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Wuxi: Telegram Requesting Rejection of Increased Cotton Tax <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The Cotton Textile Trade Association of this city previously telegraphed a request to the Central Government to severely reprimand the Cotton Merchants for submitting a request to the Central Government to increase import cotton taxes. The Chinese Cotton Mill United Association also telegraphed, insisting on a unified position. Yesterday, it convened a general membership meeting. After discussion, it was resolved that expensive cotton and cheap yarn have brought Chinese cotton mills to the brink of total collapse. Although cotton prices are now low, they are still higher than foreign cotton. Taxes should be reduced immediately; there is no reason to increase them. This association should telegraph the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Industry, severely requesting them to reject the request.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Large Quantities of Foreign Rice Arrive in Wuxi for Sale <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Recently, in the rice market of this city, the inferior grades of粳 and 秈 rice are about to be sold out. Shipments from various places are mostly high-grade, so the price of rice has risen by seven or eight jiao compared to half a month ago. Recently, although large quantities of foreign rice have arrived in Wuxi by boat, the market price has not been affected. Most of the foreign rice ordered by this city from Shanghai is futures, with the original price being 5.45 yuan per hundred jin. Calculated in local dou and hu, the price is equivalent to 11.5 yuan per shi. The current price of foreign rice in the Wuxi market is 9.45 yuan per shi. If the sellers were to sell at the current market price, they would lose more than 2 yuan per shi. Because foreign rice can be stored for a long time, they are unwilling to sell it off quickly and plan to store it in warehouses, observing the market situation before selling.</p>

<p>Yu Village in the third district of Wu County was recently being organized into baojia by Wu Zongjin, the district head of that district. Jiang Ke, the district head of the fifth district of Danyang County, also went to organize baojia, resulting in a dispute. District Head Wu of Wu County immediately drew a map and attached a certificate of proof, submitting it to the county government for instructions. County Magistrate Hou immediately sent a letter to the Danyang County government requesting verification and correction. Yesterday, the Danyang County government replied, stating that the county boundary in that area seemed to be quite different. For the sake of caution, each county should send one committee member to conduct an on-the-spot survey with the district offices of both counties. County Magistrate Hou immediately appointed Yue Jun and scheduled to go for a joint survey on the twelfth of this month. He also sent a letter to the Danyang County government requesting that a committee member be sent to arrive at the disputed location at that time for an on-the-spot survey so that a decision could be made.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Zhenjiang: Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance Recovers Management of Tobacco and Alcohol License Taxes from Various Counties and Manages it Directly <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>After the tobacco and alcohol license tax was transferred from the Ministry of Finance to the provinces for management, Zhejiang Province set up a bureau to manage it by commission, and the results were the best. Anhui Province also achieved effective results by having the business tax bureau handle it concurrently. After Jiangsu Province took over in July of last year, Gu Baoyu used the names of the tobacco and alcohol associations of Shanghai and Ningbo to contract for the entire year's tax revenue of Jiangsu Province for 760,000 yuan. The actual tax amount to be paid annually was 680,000 yuan, divided into four seasons and paid monthly. A general bureau was established in Zhenjiang, and branch bureaus were established in various districts, which were then subcontracted to others. After half a year of operation, some branch bureaus embezzled funds and fled, some failed to remit funds, and some collected excess taxes and refused to hand them over. Within eight months, the general bureau only submitted more than 130,000 yuan to the Department of Finance, which was not even enough for one quarter's quota. The Department of Finance feared that this would drag on, causing more and more disputes, making it more and more difficult to rectify. Therefore, last month, it resolutely recovered the management of famous counties south of the Yangtze River and commissioned the business tax bureaus of each county to handle it concurrently. Meanwhile, it sent personnel to various counties to investigate. If there were cases of poor management and complex content, even if the contract period had not ended, the business tax bureau was ordered to take over. Strict orders were given to recover the accumulated tax arrears in various districts. Currently, except for the second and sixth districts, which are still contracted by Gu Baoyu, all other counties have been taken back by the Department of Finance and ordered to be handled concurrently by the business tax bureau.</p>

<p>In Tudiansi Town, Tongxiang, yesterday and the day before, when a charity was distributing rations to disaster victims repatriated from Songjiang at the town's defense corps, they were suddenly robbed by a large number of rioters who also assaulted the police and defense corps. They then surged to the Zengsheng Paper Store, which was set up by Xu Luyan, the director of the fourth district office. The police team captured five people. The incident was quite serious. A telegram was immediately sent to the county government to dispatch troops to suppress the rioters in Tu Dian. In the evening, a group of disaster victims from the eastern township gathered people by beating gongs, hoping to enter the market to rob. The police bureau dispatched police to block them. Yesterday, County Magistrate Zhang visited Tu Dian and convened a meeting of town chiefs. After a decision was made, the neighborhood chiefs and township police were tasked with persuading and stopping them at any time. Meanwhile, personnel will be sent to the townships to compile a list of disaster-stricken households, and disaster relief rice will be distributed on a regular basis. The Jiaxu Disaster Relief Association has dispatched Yang Juchen and Zhu Mengxiang to the townships to investigate and implement work relief. The government is ordering the police and defense corps to detain the ringleaders for investigation.</p>

<p>Kong Ma, the wife of Kong Axiao of Kongjia Lane, Huashan, south of the city, was thirty-five years old. After her husband died, she remarried to A Bao, the son of Wang Jingzhi of Wujia Village. Her seven-year-old second son, Lin Cai, was also brought along to be raised. After she entered the Wang family, A Bao learned that Kong still had belongings and land. On the seventh, he led villagers to Kong's house to move the bed curtains. The Kong family refused, and a conflict broke out. At that time, Rui, the mother of Zhu Ruzhao, a neighbor, was sixty-one years old. She came out to mediate. In the chaos, Tao struck her on the head with a wooden stick, and she fell to the ground and died. Seeing that she had been hit, Wang A Bao and the others scattered and fled.

Wu Ying, an investigator stationed in Haimen by the Provincial Opium Prohibition Association, learned of this and led the police to arrest Tang, Yu, and Chen, as well as the smoking paraphernalia, opium pipes, and other items. They were escorted to the county government. Yesterday afternoon, after County Magistrate Chen interrogated them, he ordered them to be detained.</p>
<h3 id="e124">County Girls' Middle School Teacher Accused <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Yang Sulü, a former teacher at Hai Xia Girls' School, was accused of seducing a female student named Ni and was dismissed from her position two years ago in the spring. She has now been hired as a teacher at the County Girls' Middle School, causing resentment in the education sector. The County Education Association, the Haimen Shanghai Alumni Association, and Wang Qingbiao have successively submitted petitions to the Department of Education, the county government, and the Education Bureau, requesting that the school be ordered to replace Yang to maintain discipline in the education sector. The Education Bureau sent personnel to investigate and confirmed the facts, and reported it to the Department of Education for review, but no approval has been received to date. Yesterday, Wang Qingbiao and others telegraphed the Department of Education, urging the county to investigate thoroughly.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Song Ziwen Announces: Government's Increase in Capital for Bank of China Focuses Entirely on Policy, Not Personnel; Future Business Strategy Will Be Entirely Commercialized <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Song Ziwen, Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Council and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank of China, met with reporters from various newspapers at the Bank of China at 10:00 a.m. yesterday to announce the government's original intention in increasing the capital of the Bank of China and the Bank's future business strategy. The following is a record of Song's conversation:</p>
<p>Government's Capital Increase: Focus on Policy</p>
<p>According to Song, the government's increase in capital for the Bank of China and the appointment of himself here is entirely focused on policy, not personnel. He himself came here to promote the government's policy. Since taking office, he has not brought a single person with him. The Bank of China has a wealth of talent. He hopes that he will never send another person here in the future. All of the Bank's staff are working as usual. This shows that all of the Bank's staff understand the government's intentions. Previously, the general public did not understand the reasons for the changes in the Bank of China and rumored that the Bank's credit would not be as stable as before. However, to date, the deposits of the Bank and its branches have not decreased, and new depositors are constantly arriving. All of these facts are well known to the Bank of China's more than 2,000 employees and colleagues in the financial sector. This further shows that the society has also understood the government's intentions.</p>
<p>Bank of China's Future Business Strategy</p>
<p>The Bank of China's future business strategy will be entirely commercialized, eliminating all bureaucratic habits, and striving for international exchange and focusing on import and export trade, without conflicting with the Central Bank. This will allow each bank to develop its business with its own strength. Mr. Song Hanzhang forcefully prevented the Bank of China's banknotes from ceasing to be convertible during the Yuan Shikai era. This time, he was appointed as the General Manager of the Bank of China, which is fortunate. As for the government-appointed official shareholder directors, such as Qian Xinzhi, Ye Zhuotang, Wu Daquan, Hu Bijiang, and Wang Baolun, are all members of the business community. This further confirms that the government's changes to the Bank of China are entirely focused on policy, not personnel.</p>
<p>Song Denies Economic Control</p>
<p>Song denied the rumors that the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications would implement economic control after increasing their capital. He said that the government's increase in capital for the three banks is still based on the policy set in 1929. The Central Bank is the national bank, acting as the national treasury for revenue and expenditure. The Bank of China focuses on international exchange, and the Bank of Communications develops industries. This has not changed.</p>
<p>Promoting Relief for Industry and Commerce</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of alleviating the decline of industry and commerce, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications are discussing the implementation so that the industry and commerce on the verge of collapse can have the hope of recovery in a short period of time. As for the 5 million yuan small loan for industrial and commercial credit, which is half undertaken by the Ministry of Finance and half by the banking community, is also being actively promoted. Song said that he had not heard of the rumor that the government would control the issuance of banknotes. He thought this was referring to provincial banks, not commercial banks.</p>
<p>Inspection of Branches: Postponing Trip to Sichuan</p>
<p>Song was originally scheduled to go to Sichuan for inspection in the coming days, but due to taking office as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank of China, various matters are waiting to be handled. Therefore, he cannot spare the time to go to Sichuan for the time being. He plans to go to various branches for inspection after the matters of the head office are handled properly. It has not yet been decided whether his itinerary will first go to Pingjin. It is also learned that Song is scheduled to host a banquet at the head office on the tenth to celebrate with the bank staff.</p>

<p>Brought Back Souvenirs Such as a Jade Ruler and Large Bats: According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, Wang Zhengting, a member of the Central Committee, led a Chinese commercial tour to the Philippines last month. He then traveled to Singapore, Malaysia, and Java, etc. Now that his business is completed, he arrived in Shanghai on the French postal ship Foucault Rossel at 4:00 p.m. yesterday. He said that the current situation of overseas Chinese is better than last year. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The French ship Foucault Rossel, on which Wang was traveling, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday morning, but was delayed until 4:00 p.m. due to bad weather. It docked at the China Merchants Bureau's Middle Wharf in Hongkou. Wang's wife, Ms. Shi Meili, and the couple of Zhu Changnian, the former ambassador to Sweden, the couple of Lu Chunfang, the former consul-general to Korea, Liu Yunfang, the former secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and lawyer Wu Kaisheng, and many others went to the wharf to welcome him. After arriving in Shanghai, Wang went ashore at 4:30 p.m. and returned to his residence in Gubailu to rest with his wife and others.</p>
<p>Wang's Remarks</p>
<p>When Wang arrived in Shanghai, he told reporters on the ship that his inspection trip was very good. The situation of the declining business of overseas Chinese. In the past, the sugar merchants of Java, the rubber merchants of Singapore, the rice merchants of Saigon, and the import and export merchants of Manila were most affected by the global economic depression, but since this year, it has been better than last year, and there is a great hope of revival in the future. As for Singapore, Wang said that the preparations of the British for future world wars are military secrets and he is not at liberty to talk about them, but we can guess without asking, and know the general idea. The independence movement in the Philippines is now in full swing and will be realized next spring. It is generally believed that the first president will undoubtedly be former Speaker Quezon.</p>
<p>Gifts Brought Back</p>
<p>When Wang arrived in Shanghai yesterday, he brought many boxes, including two huge boxes containing huge bats and stingrays produced in Malaysia. According to Wang, these huge bats are not found in China and can be five or six feet long. They were given by Chen Laikang, a Chinese merchant in Malaysia.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Qian Industry to Hold Executive Committee Meeting Today to Discuss Old Loans: Factories' Request for Extension May Be Difficult to Grant <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>According to the Shiye News Agency, the Shanghai Money Trade Association has been implementing the small loan for industrial and commercial credit relief case in accordance with the resolutions of the members' meeting to do their best and not to join the banking consortium. However, the old loans must still be paid on time in order to benefit both parties. Now, the association has received a letter from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, stating that various factories and shops have requested a lenient approach for the long-term loans (i.e., old loans) that are about to expire, before the small credit loan and mortgage loan have been announced and implemented. The Committee for the Promotion of National Goods also sent a letter requesting an extension of the payment period. Qin Runqing, chairman of the association, believed that the matter was of great importance to the future of the industry and could not be answered casually. In order to handle the matter carefully, it was decided to convene the 37th meeting of the 2nd Executive Committee at the Ningbo Road Association at 2:00 p.m. today (the 10th) to publicly discuss the requests of the two parties. According to the spokesperson of the association, the old loans are collected according to the regulations on the due date in both directions. The industry also receives the amount of money according to the budget in order to meet the future borrowers, and the business can be turned around and extended. If the above requirements are followed, it is tantamount to helping others while endangering oneself. It is heard that today's meeting may not approve the request for an extension of the loan.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Commercial Acceptance Draft: Banking Association Approves Principles <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the Shanghai Banking Association held its 65th Executive Committee meeting at 4:00 p.m. yesterday and made decisions on small credit loans and commercial acceptance drafts. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Attending Committee Members</p>
<p>Yesterday was the 65th Executive Committee meeting, attached with the 63rd Standing Committee meeting. In addition to the Standing Executive Committee members, representatives of all member banks were also present. Those present were Tang Shoumin, Li Fukun, Xu Jilong, Xu Xinliu, Ye Fuxiao, Chen Zheqing, Qu Jigang, Hu Bijiang, Chen Guangfu, Wu Yunzhai, Jing Runshi, Bei Songsun, Wang Yansong, Xu Boming, Wang Boyuan, Huang Mohan, Liu Huizhi, Hu Xinan, Le Gengrong, Liu Hongyuan, Sun Jingxi, Wu Weiru, Qi Yunqing, Wang Zhihua, Yao Yinpeng, Lin Yibo, Zhu Zikui, Chen Shizhen, Zhu Huisheng, Wei Jinsan, Zhang Zhuru, Dong Xianting, and Secretary-General Lin Kanghou, etc., totaling 33 people. Chen Guangfu presided over the meeting, Gu Chengan recorded, and the ceremony was performed as usual. First, the resolutions of the 64th Executive Committee and the 62nd Standing Committee meetings were reported, and then the discussion began.</p>
<p>Credit Loan</p>
<p>(1) The case of how to handle the fact that the number of small industrial and commercial credit loans reported by various banks is close to 2 million yuan was resolved and referred to the nine-bank task force committee appointed by the last Executive Committee to formulate implementation methods. According to a committee member who attended the meeting, the original number of small credit loans was 5 million yuan, which was equally divided between the government and the banking industry. Although Minister Kong orally agreed to the government's 2.5 million yuan, he has not yet replied. The banking industry has also not agreed to undertake 500,000 yuan. Now the banking industry has already raised the original number of 2 million yuan, which can be raised. If the facts are urgent, it may first undertake the number that has been raised, but it still needs to be adapted to the times and carefully studied by the task force committee.</p>
<p>Acceptance Draft</p>
<p>(2) The case of the Acceptance Draft Task Force Committee's deliberation and approval of six principles for the acceptance draft discount business (the original text is recorded later) was resolved and approved as is, and the association will handle it separately. (3) The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the association, requesting the formulation of a method for discounting commercial acceptance drafts and appointing representatives for consultation. It was resolved to recommend Jing Runshi of the Bank of China and Xue Yisheng of the Bank of Communications to attend as representatives. Other cases were also discussed and the meeting adjourned at 5:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Six Principles</p>
<p>The six principles for the commercial acceptance draft discount business are as follows: (1) Gradually replace credit overdraft loans with acceptance drafts. (2) The association should submit a request to the Ministry of Finance, approving the discounting of these bills to be used as reserve for issuance. (3) Please ask the Central Bank to publicly determine the discount rate daily and post it so that each bank can determine its own discount rate. This discount rate should be lower than the credit overdraft rate. (4) After each bank receives the discount, it can rediscount with each other, and finally rediscount with the Central Bank. (5) When each bank receives the acceptance draft discount business, if it needs to investigate with its peers, it is hoped that each bank will report the facts as much as possible. (6) If the bill is refused payment upon maturity, the discounting bank shall be obligated to report to its peers.</p>
<p>Money Industry Research</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the money industry yesterday that Article 4, Paragraph 4 of Chapter 3 of the Shanghai Money Trade Industry Regulations, the Scope of Business, has a provision for "the discounting of various term bills." However, although there is the above provision, each money shop is very cautious about discounting term bills. It does not discount to unfamiliar customers in order to prevent abuses. As for the issue of discounting commercial acceptance drafts, the Money Trade Association has submitted a request to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to formulate discounting methods, and has submitted them for detailed study. After a considerable decision is made, it will be submitted to the members' representatives' standing committee for discussion. As for the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, it has decided to wait for the banking and money industries to submit the names of their representatives before convening a joint meeting of the representatives of the banking and money industries to make a decision.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Two Groups Host Farewell Banquet for Envoy He Yesterday <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Our country's first envoy to Turkey, Mr. He Yaozu, is scheduled to depart at 12:30 noon today on the Italian ship "Conte Verde." He has been very busy with social engagements in Shanghai these past few days. Yesterday, the Northwest Problem Research Association hosted a banquet at the Bank Club at 3:00 PM, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce hosted a farewell banquet at 6:00 PM. Details are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Northwest Research Association The Northwest Problem Research Association held a farewell banquet for Envoy He at the Bank Club on Hong Kong Road at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Attendees included Lin Kanghou, Zhu Yingpeng, Sun Huizhi, Guo Weiping, Pan Dajing, Yin Zhufu, Huang Jingwan, Jiang Jianbai, Zhu Shaokang, Xie Baosheng, Lai Xingru, Qi Guoping, Pan Yangyao, Dai Yuheng, Chen Xuzhu, Hu Hanjun, and others. First, Chairman Cai Kanghou delivered a farewell speech, saying, "The Northwest problem is greatly valued by both the government and the people. Envoy He's trip to Turkey this time is significant because Turkey is very close to our Northwest and has close ties. Turkey is striving for rejuvenation, and its previous status was similar to that of our country. We hope that Envoy He will report Turkey's diplomatic, political, economic, and educational regulations to our government and people for reference." Mr. He then gave a reply, which is omitted.</p>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Last night at 6:00 PM, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce hosted a farewell banquet for Mr. He. More than twenty people attended, including Wang Xiaofan, Chen Zheqing, Wu Xingya, Pan Gongzhan, Xiong Xiling, Du Yuesheng, and Shen Tianxin. Xiong Shaokang, Chairman of the Guangzhou Municipal Chamber of Commerce, happened to be in Shanghai and was also invited to the banquet. Chairman Chen Zheqing delivered a speech, saying, "Envoy He Guiyan is a senior figure in the military. Initially, he led divisions and participated in the Northern Expedition of the 16th year of the Republic of China under the command of Chairman Jiang, for which he was credited with meritorious service. Later, he defended the capital, planned strategies, and his scholarly military demeanor was renowned in the world. Our chamber has long admired your brilliance but has not had the opportunity to express our sentiments. Now, we are fortunate to witness your appointment as envoy to Turkey. Your carriage is about to depart, and you are passing through Shanghai, allowing our colleagues to raise a glass and have a good meeting, which we deeply appreciate. Our chamber still remembers that when our country first established diplomatic relations with foreign countries, most of those selected were sought from the Hanlin Academy. Later, as translation talents emerged, they were selected from the Tongwen Guan and Guang Fangyan Guan. Recently, those familiar with military strategy and knowledgeable about foreign situations have been appointed, integrating literary and military skills, both internal and external, into one. Envoys such as Envoy Jiang stationed in Japan and Envoy Liu stationed in Germany have already added luster. Today, you, sir, form a tripod with them, truly showing that the country has no shortage of talent and is gradually restoring the grand tradition of the Zhou Dynasty, where literary and military affairs were not separated, which is truly gratifying. Turkey had exchanges with China as early as the Tang Dynasty and is China's oldest neighbor, but it has only established diplomatic relations with our country in recent years, making it our newest neighbor. Its people are known in history for their agility, bravery, and resistance to foreign tribes, and the country's Grand President Kemal rose from the military, and his civil and military achievements shine in the Near East, which our country envies. As for commercial relations with our country, because that country has never been known for its business acumen, although it has also followed the Soviet Union's policy of state-run industries in recent years and strived for self-sufficiency, its relationship with our country is still shallow, and the volume of goods imported and exported each year is minimal. Therefore, the duties of our country's envoy to Turkey in the future are not so much about developing trade between the two countries as about closely observing the national situation, understanding their strengths, and choosing the best to follow. Our chamber has repeatedly heard Envoy He's lectures on the situation in Turkey when he was in Beijing and Shanghai, which can be described as knowing them like the back of his hand. Even experts specializing in international affairs cannot surpass his knowledge. Our chamber is pleased that the country has found the right person and also remembers that our country is still unable to shake off the nickname of 'Sick Man of the Far East,' which is similar to the way Europeans used to regard Turkey as the 'Sick Man of the Near East.' We deeply hope that Envoy He can do his best to observe the country's affairs and provide good advice, providing a reference for our country's revitalization, then Envoy He's trip will be a great contribution to the party and the country, and he will receive no small reward. Our chamber respectfully offers a toast at the time of your departure, wishing you success on this trip." (Mr. He's reply is omitted.)</p>

<h3 id="e133">Second Day of the Art Exhibition Preview More Visitors Than the Previous Day <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that yesterday was the second day of the Shanghai preview of the London Exhibition of Chinese Art. Although the weather was cloudy, because there was no rain, the number of visitors was even greater than the previous day, with more foreigners than Chinese and more women than men. The praise for our country's ancient art filled the entire venue. A reporter from the Central News Agency specially recorded the various situations yesterday as follows:</p>
<p>Transportation Ship Not Yet Determined</p>
<p>The antiques for this exhibition will be carefully packed after the closing and handed over to a British special warship for transportation to London for exhibition. Currently, the British side has designated the HMS Suffolk to come to Shanghai for transport. The ship is one of the British Asian Fleet and is currently anchored off the Bund in the French Concession. Yesterday morning at 10:30 AM, under the guidance of British representative Mr. Raffael, the secretary of the exhibition, Tang Xifen, and Zhuang Shangyan, together with a delegation from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company led by Wei Huanzhang, went to visit the ship. Wei is well-versed in maritime transportation. The ship's captain, Mr. Manners, warmly received them, offered wine and food, and guided them to visit the entire ship and warehouse. The ship is about 10,000 tons, more than seven hundred feet long, and the hull is very narrow, so it travels very fast, reaching about thirty knots per hour. They returned to the exhibition at about 11:00 AM. In the afternoon at 3:00 PM, Captain Manners also visited the exhibition for three hours before returning to the ship. As to whether the ship is suitable for transporting antiques, the person in charge of the exhibition has not yet agreed to announce it, but it is said that the ship vibrates slightly when traveling at a considerable speed, and this time the ship is returning to England for rest and will go directly to Portsmouth instead of London. Therefore, the route to be taken for the transportation of antiques to England in the future is still unknown.</p>
<p>Art School Students Visit</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, more than fifty students from the Hangzhou National Academy of Art, led by the Dean of Academic Affairs, came to Shanghai specifically to purchase tickets to enter the venue and visit for a long time. The order at the exhibition was also very good, and the audience paid great attention to conversations and footsteps.</p>
<p>Zheng Tianxi Attends</p>
<p>According to the exhibition, (1) In the section of calligraphy, two paintings by Lang Shining were selected. Lang was originally Italian. The English catalog originally transliterated Lang's name according to Chinese pronunciation. Now it has been changed to Lang's original Italian name, Castiglione Girseppe. (2) Copperware No. 80 was originally "Rhino Zun," now changed to "Sacrificial Zun." (3) Zheng Tianxi, the Chinese special envoy for the London Art Exhibition, was at the exhibition all day yesterday, discussing the export of antiques with the managers of the exhibition. (4) Many people visited the exhibition yesterday, half of whom were Westerners, including antique dealers carefully appreciating and evaluating the exhibits, believing that the exhibits were indeed Chinese treasures.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Social Affairs Bureau Advocates for the Establishment of Labor-Farmer Cooperatives (Continued) <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>(2) Promotion of Rural Cooperation</p>
<p>Implementation Steps</p>
<p>This city is an industrial and commercial area and is not known for agriculture. However, in terms of the area of farmland in this city, it accounts for about three-fifths of the city's area, and the number of farmers accounts for more than one-tenth of the city's total population. Moreover, due to the international economic pressure and the prevalence of natural disasters in recent years, the rural areas of this city are on the verge of bankruptcy. Rural areas and cities have interconnected economic relations, and rescuing rural areas is an important political task at present. There are many ways to rescue them, but the most important and easy way is to promote rural cooperation. The bureau, in view of this, has specially formulated the "Outline of the Rural Cooperative Plan of this City" and the "Rural Cooperative Experimental Area Plan of this City" to promote it, and the municipal government has raised 80,000 yuan for the rural cooperative loan fund for the lending of cooperatives and for economic assistance. In addition, three rural cooperative instructors were extended to investigate the rural situation and take responsibility for guiding the cooperatives. Now, the Yinhang District is designated as an experimental area for active implementation, hoping to achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>Plan Outline</p>
<p>Shanghai Rural Cooperative Plan Outline: (1) The rural areas of this city include Gaoqiao, Tangqiao, Jiangwan, Gaoxing, Zhenru, Lixing, Wusong, Pengpu, Yinhang, Pusong, Fahua, Caojing, Yangsi, Zhabei, Yinxiang, and Yangjing, a total of seventeen districts. Except for Zhabei, Hunan, Yinxiang, and Yangjing, four districts which are mostly industrial and commercial areas, the remaining thirteen districts are places where farmers are concentrated. It is decided to set up one cooperative in each district, and sub-branches can be set up in various townships according to actual needs. (2) The rural cooperatives in each district are set as both-operating nature, and their business includes credit purchase, sales, utilization of production, etc., depending on the economic situation of each district, to determine which business is important, which business is secondary, which should be done first, and which can be done slowly. The bureau and the municipal agricultural association and municipal commissioners from each district will send personnel to various townships to promote, so that farmers understand the benefits of the cooperative and help them organize. (3) The business of rural cooperatives in each district will be conducted according to the needs of each district. However, in order to seek the stability and development of the cooperative, the government authorities should allocate loan funds to the rural cooperatives in this city to use them as a turnover, so that their capital will not be exhausted. According to the current local situation in this city, there are seventeen townships. Except for the four districts that are industrial and commercial areas where the establishment will be postponed, the remaining thirteen districts should be established in phases. Each district should set up one cooperative and four sub-branches, then thirteen districts should set up thirteen cooperatives and fifty-two sub-branches. If the loan for each district cooperative is assumed to be 5,000 yuan, then the thirteen districts will total 65,000 yuan, plus a reserve of 15,000 yuan, a total of 80,000 yuan is required. (4) The cooperative loan fund of 80,000 yuan is designated to be kept by the Municipal Bank of this city, and the Social Affairs Bureau formulates measures for phased lending, but only to legally registered rural cooperatives, and those who have not registered shall not request loans. (5) It is practically difficult to hold rural cooperatives in the thirteen townships of this city at the same time. Now, it is planned to handle them in phases. The first phase is Lixing, Yangsi, Wusong, Pengpu; the second phase is Gaoxing, Yinhang, Pusong, Gaoqiao; the third phase is Caojing, Fahua, Jiangwan, Tangqiao, Zhenru. (6) The preparation period for each phase is pre-determined to be three months to six months. During this period, the bureau and the municipal agricultural association and the municipal commissioners of each district are responsible for the preparation and urge the establishment of rural cooperatives in each district on time. (7) The term of the loan shall not exceed one year, but an extension may be applied for, limited to once. The standard of loan interest is 6% per annum. The loan procedures are based on the following restrictions in principle, but may be changed according to the economic situation of each cooperative: (1) Within the first two years of the establishment of a rural cooperative, the funds released by the community to its members and the needs for handling various businesses may request full borrowing. (2) After the establishment of the cooperative, starting from the third year, the funds released by the community to its members and other business needs may request borrowing up to seven-tenths of the total amount, and the rest should be raised by the community. (3) After the establishment of the cooperative, starting from the fifth year, the funds released by the community to its members and other business needs may request borrowing up to four-tenths of the total amount, and the rest should be raised by the community.

<h3 id="e137">Ministry of Communications Building a Mansion in Shanghai Re-progressing According to the Original Plan <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that in order to facilitate its operations, the Ministry of Communications had planned to rebuild the Communications Building on the original site of the Telegraph Bureau on Sichuan Road and Fourth Road, so that all agencies of the Ministry in Shanghai could move in uniformly. However, due to various reasons, it has not been realized. However, this matter is now being re-progressed because the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau will no longer move to Beijing. It is learned that all construction will be based on the original plan, and the Telegraph Bureau and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau will move in first. If there are any remaining rooms, other agencies of the Ministry of Communications in Shanghai will be planned to move in for office work. It is estimated that the Telegraph Bureau will need four floors, and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau will need two floors. The mansion was originally planned for twelve floors, so it is expected that there will be remaining rooms allocated to other agencies of the Ministry of Communications for use. As for the construction funds, they have also been settled and are being actively planned so that they can be realized as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Trucking Industry Efforts for Aviation Salvation Donations Responded to the Chief Commander's Public Banquet the Night Before <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Solicitation Team Headquarters of the China Aviation Association previously sent a letter to the Trucking Industry Association soliciting donations for aviation salvation. The association passed a resolution to solicit 100,000 yuan. It has now completed the survey of the number of trucks for transporting goods and moving venues in all directions and will begin solicitation. In order to liaise and understand the progress, the office of the chief commander of the team hosted a banquet for all executive and supervisory committee members of the Trucking Industry Association and the deputy team leader of the 104th Team at the Youth Association on the 9th floor on the 8th at 7:00 PM. Those present included the chairman of the association, the team leader of the 104th Solicitation Team, Lou Yinchuan, committee members Jiang Zhongying, Sun Jinquan, Qian Fengyi, Jiang Shuji, Xie Chunsheng, Shao Xiaoyu, Luo Fubao, Xu Youqing, Ge Aishi, Sun Deshou, Chen Tingchen, Chen Quangen, Sun Jinquan, Yuan Zhichao, Chen Yuling, Ye Hanjun, Ji Zongxiang, Lu Wenji, Liu Ziqiao, Wang Tonghe, and more than twenty others, the Chief Commander of the General Team Office, Mayor Wu (represented by Li Dachao), Li Dachao, Zhang Yuliang, and Chen Shuo. Chairman Wu, the Chief Commander (represented by Li), recorded Chen Shuo. The chairman reported briefly, saying, "Today, I am very honored to meet you all on this occasion. Mayor Wu cannot come due to hosting Envoy He Yaozu, so I am here on his behalf. You are all very enthusiastic and working hard to support the aviation salvation movement. Not only is the Aviation Association very clear, but all aspects of Shanghai are also aware that the trucking industry is enthusiastic about patriotism. The China Aviation Association is a people's organization, and all compatriots should join it, concentrating the strength of the masses, spirit, and economy to carry out the national salvation movement. During the first solicitation movement, Mayor Wu served as the chief commander, guiding and working hard, and with the generous donations and enthusiastic support of people from all walks of life, the result was soliciting 100,000 members and more than 1.2 million yuan in aviation salvation funds. The purpose of this solicitation movement is to solicit 100,000 new members and solicit 1 million yuan in aviation salvation funds. Leaders from all walks of life, agencies, groups, and schools have been additionally hired as team leaders of the solicitation team to work hard separately. I believe that we will definitely achieve our hopes. As for you in the trucking industry, you are very enthusiastic and have decided to solicit 100,000 yuan in aviation salvation funds through meetings. I hope you will work hard to support this, and on the one hand, you can also make the organization of the association more sound. Car companies that have not joined the association should join it, and concentrating the strength of the organization will have a very bright future. Today, I invite you all to express your opinions on the solicitation of aviation salvation donations as much as possible, and to decide when to start the solicitation. I hope that we will unite our strength and work hard to carry it out, and the future of the country and the nation will rely on it." Next, Lou Yinchuan, chairman of the Trucking Industry Association, committee members Jiang Zhongying, Sun Jinquan, Qian Fengyi, and Ye Hanjun spoke in succession, saying that they were very moved by the chairman's report. National salvation is the responsibility of the people. During the first solicitation, because the association was reorganized, there was not much work on the group side, which was regrettable. However, many colleagues have already joined as members. In this solicitation movement, we should do our best. Regarding the aviation salvation donations, the industry has decided to solicit 100,000 yuan through meetings. It has now begun and will start on its own after completing the survey of all relevant aspects. Although the market is not prosperous, we must adhere to our purpose and work hard to solicit in the midst of difficulties and hardships in order to achieve our goals. However, the strength of the association is weak. Please ask Chief Commander Wu, the mayor, to guide and help, so that the association will be sound, which is fortunate. They also discussed the solicitation of aviation salvation donations. For rental trucks for transporting goods and moving venues, 2% should be collected from customers according to the standard of business volume, and the minimum limit of 6 yuan per vehicle should be collected per month. For trucks for transporting goods and moving venues prepared by themselves, 6 yuan should be donated per month. At 9:30, the guests and hosts parted happily.</p>

<p>Yesterday (the 9th) was the second anniversary of Mr. Liang Yansun's death. Relatives and friends in Shanghai held a memorial meeting at Baoben Hall on Changsha Road. More than two hundred people attended, including Ye Yuhu, Lu Jianquan, Qian Xinzhi, Wu Daquan, Hu Bijiang, Feng Gengguang, Liu Tiecheng, Huang Renzhi, Lin Xisheng, Lu Dingkui, Zhang Mingzhen, Hu Mengjia, Li Fuhou, Chen Zheqing, Wang Zijian, and aided students. Mr. Liang's calligraphy and paintings, foundation documents, student achievements, etc. were displayed in the venue. The most precious of these were two handwritten letters from Mr. Liang Rengong inviting Mr. Liang to Tianjin to discuss national affairs before the brewing of the Hongxian monarchy, and the communication issued by the Reuters telegram in Tokyo at that time regarding Mr. Liang's opposition to the monarchy (this communication was translated and presented to Yuan Shikai by Zhengzhuan Hall, and Yuan personally wrote "Sent to Mr. Liang for review"). There were also documents on handling foreign affairs, and the first railway tickets issued in our country, etc. The meeting was announced to be open, and then Mr. Ye Yuhu was publicly elected as the chairman. Flowers were offered to Mr. Liang's portrait and rituals were performed as usual. After the ceremony, Lu Jianquan, recommended by the Academic Scholarship Committee, reported on the receipt and payment of the scholarship fund, stating briefly that the scholarship fund has now purchased and stored 210,000 yuan in government bonds and that more than 5,100 yuan was spent on subsidies this year. Then, Mr. Lin Xisheng, recommended by the Academic Scholarship Committee, reported on the achievements of the subsidized students. There are currently fifteen students receiving scholarships, and their average grades are all above 80 points. The schools where the subsidized students are enrolled are Tianjin Nankai, Beijing Normal, Shanghai Jiaotong, Nanjing Jinling, Guangzhou Lingnan, and Guangxi University, etc. Then, Mr. Ye Yuhu, recommended by the Editorial Committee of the Collection of Literary Works, reported on the progress of editing the Collection of Literary Works, briefly stating that at the beginning of editing the Collection of Literary Works, a letter was sent to solicit Mr. Liang's life, words, deeds, and deeds, but not much was obtained. All rely on the collection of all parties. Now the chronology has been compiled to 1917. After 1918, it has also begun. It was originally intended to be completed by the end of this year, but I dare not say that there is certainty. I hope that the colleagues present will continue to work hard to collect and supply so that human and financial resources will not be wasted and we can see its success as soon as possible. After the report, there was a recording of Mr. Liang's economic speech in 1924, which was to develop the national economy and prepare six tools. In the speech, he repeatedly mentioned the three northeastern provinces, which meant that Mr. Liang was aware of the neighbor's economic invasion of the northeastern provinces at the time of the speech. After the playback, Mr. Zhang Jianquan, Mr. Hu Yuantan, and others spoke in succession, saying that Mr. Liang's life-long dedication and contribution to the country, society, economy, and education can be seen from today's displayed documents, recordings, and scholarship undertakings after his death. They expressed their deep admiration. After the meeting, the Academic Scholarship Committee was held to discuss various important matters this year.</p>
<h3 id="e140">New Merchants in Huai Salt Region Request Equal Treatment from Five Banks: Continued Lending While Avoiding Monopoly by Old Merchants <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reports: Since the implementation of the rotational sales system for salt from the Huaibei region sold in Bangbu and along the Wan River, the method has been quite appropriate. However, banks generally do not provide tax loans to new merchants, requiring them to raise their own tax funds. Additionally, they do not offer loans against salt when it arrives, leading to financial difficulties. Recently, a group of new merchants, including Li Cheng and others, wrote to the Shanghai headquarters of various banks, outlining their concerns: "Bangbu is the sole authorized port for the sale of Huai salt, and borrowing from banks against arriving salt is the only way for merchants to manage their finances. This system has been convenient for many years. Recently, your banks have ceased offering tax loans and salt-backed loans to new merchants trading in Bangbu, while continuing to provide loans and ample funds to the existing thirty-odd merchants. We find several aspects of this inexplicable and respectfully request clarification.</p>
<p>We understand that your bank's differential treatment of new and old merchants may be due to existing tax agreements. However, these new merchants are transporting salt in accordance with regulations and have obtained approval from the government authorities beforehand. The new tax salt must be sold in order of arrival and through a rotational system after the existing eighty-nine trainloads have been cleared. This demonstrates the government's care in protecting bank loans and safeguarding the capital of the existing merchants. Therefore, there is no possibility of the new merchants disrupting the port sales or hindering bank lending. Yet your banks discriminate against the new merchants' salt by refusing to provide either tax loans or salt-backed loans. This is inexplicable.</p>
<p>Perhaps your bank believes that the creditworthiness of new merchants is inferior to that of old merchants, making you unwilling to provide tax loans. While this might be understandable, the salt has already arrived, and each bag costs eleven yuan. The quality and weight have been inspected and certified by the government, making it indistinguishable from the salt of established merchants. Yet we cannot even obtain loans at a discounted rate. This is also inexplicable.</p>
<p>Or perhaps your bank is currently pursuing a policy of tightening credit, with set quotas for total lending, and thus temporarily refusing to provide loans. However, you continue to provide ample new tax funds to the old merchants, disguising it as '拼裝' (piecing together) or '凑車' (grouping cars). According to railway regulations, a full carload of fifteen tons or more is sufficient for joint transportation. Even if it requires piecing together, several dozen to several hundred '担' (a unit of weight) should be enough. Why then are you piecing together several thousand '担'? This is the third inexplicable matter.</p>
<p>We aim to promote the sale of salt produced in our respective regions, and therefore have no choice but to trade in Bangbu. However, our capital is limited, allowing us to transport only tens or hundreds of tons at a time. This approach, with each merchant transporting smaller quantities, can alleviate difficulties and reduce the problem of excessive inventory at the port. These are our humble views.</p>
<p>Regarding whether your banks provide tax loans, you have your own policies, and we are not in a position to comment. However, we hope that all salt arriving at the port will be treated equally and that you will continue to provide loans as usual. This would be in line with your bank's duty to regulate social finance and support small businesses, while avoiding the creation of a monopolistic situation. Therefore, we dare to present our concerns and respectfully request a clear explanation. We await your response with great anticipation."</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted to: Zhang, General Manager of the Bank of China; Chen, General Manager of the Shanghai Bank; Tang, General Manager of the Bank of Communications; Xu, General Manager of the Jiangsu Bank; and Xu, General Manager of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank.</p>

<p>Mr. Wang Guanxian, a native of Jiangsu, is a graduate of the former National Southeast University. In the 17th year [of the Republic], he passed the Jiangsu Province exam for county magistrates and served as magistrate in Baoying, Funing, and Gaochun counties, among others, with outstanding achievements. He also devoted his spare time to writing and research, offering insightful analyses and suggestions for improving county administration. After resigning from his post two years ago, he went to the United States to specialize in local administration. He obtained a Master of Arts degree in political science from the University of Michigan in one year, with excellent grades. He was highly praised by Professor Ralph, a renowned expert in municipal administration in the United States. We have learned that Mr. Wang returned to China yesterday. He stated that given the increasingly precarious state of the nation in recent years, genuine reform of local politics is necessary to unlock the full potential of the entire political system. He intends to publish a comprehensive article outlining his views for consideration by the authorities.</p>

<p>The China Jisheng Association notes that last year's drought was exceptionally severe, and the disaster victims are in dire need of assistance. As the period between harvests approaches, the spring relief efforts in Yixing, Jiangsu Province, have been jointly organized with the China and Foreign Relief Association and are currently underway. The situation in Liyang is particularly dire, and representatives from the county have repeatedly come to Shanghai urgently requesting relief. The association, in consultation with the China and Foreign Relief Association, has jointly organized relief efforts and appointed Mr. Li Yunmen as the director. He, along with relief workers, is scheduled to travel to Liyang on the 9th of this month to investigate and implement spring relief measures. However, with the scale of the disaster being vast and funds being limited, the efforts are akin to a drop in the bucket. How much relief can the disaster victims receive? It is hoped that charitable individuals at home and abroad will act with compassion and generously donate to save lives, for saving a life is more meritorious than building a seven-story pagoda. The merit is truly immeasurable.</p>

<p>The Huining Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai learned that the central government had issued permits for 100,000 "石" (a unit of dry volume) of duty-free foreign rice for Anhui province, to be distributed by the provincial disaster relief committee to the affected counties. Upon hearing this news, the association immediately telegraphed the provincial capital on the 30th of last month to request permits to aid the famine in the twelve counties formerly under the jurisdiction of Huizhou and Ningguo. The association has now received a telegram from the provincial disaster relief committee stating that the duty-free permits have already been allocated: Shexian, Yixian, Jixi, and Qimen counties in Huizhou each received 2,000 "石," and Xiuning and Wuyuan each received 4,000 "石." Xuancheng, Nanling, Ningguo, Jingxian, Jingde, and Taiping counties in Ningguo each received 2,000 "石." The association has been requested to inform the respective county governments to contact them for permits. It is reported that the association has already telegraphed the county governments to prepare official documents and collect them directly from the provincial disaster relief committee.</p>

<p>The Continental Daily News reports that Ms. White Jack, a 22-year-old Austrian ice skating expert, recently accepted an invitation from the Japan Ice Skating Association to perform in Tokyo several times. After staying in Japan for two months, she is now passing through Shanghai on her way back to her home country. Ms. Jack amazed Europe with her ice skating skills at the age of eleven. She won the silver medal in the ice skating competition at the Olympic Games in both 1928 and 1932. After returning home, she plans to train diligently, hoping to win the women's ice skating championship at the next Olympic Games. Ms. Jack expressed her surprise that Shanghai, a city as prosperous as it is, does not have a single ice skating rink. She also noted that since the last Olympic Games, there has been a significant increase in the number of men and women learning to ice skate in Japan, and their progress has been rapid. Tokyo now has three ice skating rinks, one of which is as large as the Lake Placid ice skating rink in the United States. Osaka and other major cities each have at least one ice skating rink.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Dinghai Fellow-Provincials Association to Rebuild Hall and Relocate Charity House: Fellow-Provincials Registry First <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>On December 9th of last year, the Dinghai Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai held a memorial service for Mr. He Caitang at the Dinghai Hall on Pingjili Road. Approximately several hundred people attended. Taking advantage of the gathering, they discussed various issues such as renovating the hall, merging the fellow-provincials association, and relocating the Shanzhang Charity House. Mr. Chen Yiting spoke first, stating that the hall had been established for over 30 years and needed repairs costing approximately 20,000 yuan. The current fund is approximately 40,000 yuan. If this fund is used for repairs, the fund will be reduced, and the income will also decrease, which may not be sufficient for future expenses. He suggested rebuilding the hall into a three- or four-story Western-style building, adding rental housing on both sides, and relocating the fellow-provincials association to the hall for office space. This would both increase the usable space and generate more income, which would be a win-win situation. Mr. Pan Shanglin then spoke, stating that the Shanzhang Charity House in Rihuigang has been ordered to relocate within three years. The area is becoming more prosperous, and land prices are also rising. He suggested converting the land into rental housing, and the rental income would be the Charity House's regular expenses. He suggested purchasing 50 "亩" (a unit of area) of land at a low price in or near the Hongkou Zhibei or Beixinjing area and building a charity house there. This land purchase would be funded by donations from fellow-provincials, whether it be one "亩", half a "亩", or a quarter of a "亩." The idea is to gather contributions together. There are tens of thousands of fellow-provincials in Shanghai, surely they have the ability to contribute more than 50 "亩." As long as they are enthusiastic, there will surely be success. Mr. Chen Dafang then spoke, stating that the fellow-provincials present should know how many fellow-provincials there are in Shanghai, and even more importantly, how many poor and unemployed fellow-provincials there are. To know these numbers, the fellow-provincials association must first register the population. The method would be to set up group leaders in each district, who would register the residents together with the staff of the fellow-provincials association. If honest and reliable unemployed individuals are found, the fellow-provincials association can find ways to introduce them or send them back to their hometown to prevent them from wandering in other places. On the other hand, the small-to-middle-class families can do their part for the hall. Many hands make light work. The renovation of the hall and the relocation of the charity house can both arise from the registration. Subsequently, Mr. Xu Tingzuo and Mr. Qian Derun made similar supplementary speeches. Liu Hongsheng, Xu Tingzuo, Qian Derun, Chen Yiting, and Pan Shanglin were nominated as members of the preparatory committee. It has been reported that the Dinghai Fellow-Provincials Association is starting with the registration process and gradually implementing the above points.</p>

<p>Jiang Junyan, a native of Ningbo who studied chemical engineering in Japan, recently founded the Shanghai Lacquer Manufacturing Factory at 313 Ma Bai Road in Shanghai, producing "Flying Horse" brand lacquer. The colors are bright and beautiful, and the price is low. In this time of industrial competition, the leakage of funds for lacquer alone is quite large each year. The Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai is committed to promoting national goods, and the "Flying Horse" brand lacquer is also produced by a native of Ningbo, so it should be supported. Yesterday, they sent separate letters to various automobile companies and commercial and industrial circles, requesting them to adopt it as soon as possible to promote it.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Waiter at China Restaurant Sues for Divorce <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Lin Zhisong, a native of Ningbo, is currently working as a waiter at the China Restaurant. In the 19th year [of the Republic], he married his fellow-provincial woman Qiu Axiu (26 years old) through a matchmaker. They rented a house at No. 65 Ruicing Lane, East Jiaxing Road. The relationship between the couple was initially very harmonious. Subsequently, they had two children, who both died one after another. Lin Qiu is now pregnant again. Unexpectedly, Lin Zhisong has recently changed his behavior, not returning home at night. Lin Qiu felt that her husband was behaving strangely, so she investigated and learned that he had another woman. Lin Qiu saw her husband going astray and was deeply concerned, so she gently advised him to change. However, Lin Zhisong not only did not realize his error, but instead harbored resentment and treated his wife like a thorn in his side, frequently verbally and physically abusing her, showing no marital affection. Now, Lin Zhisong has hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Local Court, requesting permission to divorce Qiu Axiu. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Peng Shi presided over the hearing in the Civil Court No. 14. Both the plaintiff and defendant arrived in court with their lawyers. According to the plaintiff Lin Zhisong's statement, the defendant Lin Qiu does not uphold the virtues of a wife and often goes out gambling and wandering. On the fifth day of the first lunar month, she ran away from home. At first, he did not suspect anything, but after waiting for three days and not seeing her return, he reported it to the police, which is on record. Therefore, he requests a divorce. Subsequently, according to the defendant Qiu Axiu, on the fifth day of the first lunar month, she went to visit her maternal uncle's house for the New Year and stayed overnight. When she returned home the next morning, she found that the door was locked. Upon asking the plaintiff's mother, she was told that Lin Zhisong had taken the key and said that she had been sued in court and did not need to return home. Seeing this situation, she had no choice but to return to her mother's house to stay temporarily. She does not want to divorce the plaintiff and requests that the divorce lawsuit be rejected. The lawyers for both sides then debated each other to the end. Judge Peng then adjourned the court and announced that the verdict would be pronounced on the afternoon of the 10th.</p>

<h3 id="e152">After Killing Robbers, Stray Bullet Kills a British Man: Fierce Battle Between Detectives and Robbers Behind Hongkou Police Station; Municipal Council Laborer Zhu Amao Seriously Injured <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at around 6:00 AM, three young men arrived at the Zhongshan Automobile Company at the intersection of Gongping Road and Broadway Road in Hongkou, claiming that they wanted to rent a car to go to Yuanchang Road. The company assigned Jiangbei native Wen Dingxin as the driver to drive car No. 12608, which was registered in the foreign settlement. On the way, the young men instructed the driver to stop at the entrance of Yuanchang Lane on Yuanchang Road. Upon reaching the destination, the three men got out of the car one after another and walked into the lane, telling the driver to wait outside. The driver assumed they were visiting friends, so he did not pay attention. Unexpectedly, the young men were actually robbers. After walking into the lane, they went straight to the home of Wang Shiting (a native of Taixing), a traditional Chinese medicine surgeon at No. 16. They drew their pistols, knocked on the door, and went inside. They went upstairs and broke into Wang's bedroom. Wang had not yet gotten out of bed, so he was unable to resist and allowed them to search the room. However, Wang's eldest son, Wang Quan, who was 15 years old, had already gotten up. Seeing that the visitors were up to no good, he quickly ran to the balcony, crossed the rooftops, and escaped to a neighbor's house to report the incident and ask for help. As a result, the neighbors went with him to report to the gatekeeper, and the gatekeeper blew the whistle to alert the police. Police officers in the vicinity heard the alarm and rushed to the scene. As they were preparing to enter the lane to surround and arrest the robbers, the robbers noticed them. They grabbed the stolen goods and fled from the house. Two of the robbers fled east, while one robber ran to the entrance of the lane, jumped into the car, and forced the driver to drive at full speed and flee west. The police officers saw the robbers fleeing in the car, so they chased after them, drawing their guns and shooting at the car. The robber in the car fired back at the police officers. Gunshots rang out, and bullets flew like beads. When they reached the Pengpu Road intersection, the car's rear tire was shot out by the police officers, making it difficult to drive. The robbers ordered the driver to stop the car immediately. However, the car was traveling at high speed, and when the driver suddenly slammed on the brakes, the car swerved and crashed into the sidewalk. At that moment, the robber jumped out of the car and fled towards the Hongkou triangle market on Miller Road. However, seeing that the police officers were about to catch up, he turned around and fired again while running, retreating into the area behind the Hongkou police station. The police officers also arrived and engaged in a fierce battle. The robber was shot four times in the body and once in the head, and he collapsed to the ground due to his injuries and died on the spot. However, during the fierce battle, it so happened that McDonald, the British foreman of the lathe department of the Ruirong Iron Factory, was passing by on Miller Road. Unable to avoid the stray bullets, he was struck in the brain and abdomen. He died at the same time behind the Hongkou police station. He was a truly tragic victim. Also, a Municipal Council Public Works Department laborer named Zhu Amao was injured by a stray bullet. His injuries were very serious, and his life may be in danger. He was sent to the Municipal Council hospital for treatment by the police car. The robber's body was sent to the coroner's office for an autopsy. The body of the British man McDonald was reported to the British Consulate for an autopsy and arrangements for his funeral. Regarding the loss of the victim, it was estimated to be over one hundred gold pieces. The police believed that the car driver's actions were suspicious, so he was temporarily detained for investigation.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Industrial Trust Company Ferry Management Office has been experiencing significant growth in its business recently. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mr. Tan Boying, the manager of the company, yesterday to inquire about the situation. Mr. Tan described the recent business conditions as follows:</p>
<p>Ferry No. 6</p>
<p>The municipal ferry has been operating night cruises in the summer for many years, and tourists are very crowded. The original ferries were not enough to accommodate them. In addition, the company has also been requested by major shipping companies to pick up and drop off passengers from ocean liners. Long-term contracts have been signed with the Zha Hua Company, and other companies have also come to hire ferries due to the company's thoughtful service. The company has been hesitant to agree because there were not enough ferries, recognizing the urgent need for these two items, they will build a special Ferry No. 6. All designs are similar to Ferry No. 5, and the magnificent is even more so. It has been under construction for several months and will be completed in the summer.</p>
<p>Seaside Bathing Resort</p>
<p>The Gaoqiao Seaside Bathing Resort, located outside the seawall of the East Beach, has a natural sandy beach that is the only place for Chinese and Westerners in Shanghai to rest in the summer. Its business has always been owned by the Gaoqiao Seaside Hotel. This year, the hotel is focusing on the hotel business and is willing to transfer the bathing resort business to the company. The company is requesting approval from the municipal government and is focusing on sorting it out. Inside the seawall, there will be mud dredging to create a dam and water will be introduced to make tides. It will be divided into two parts, inside and outside, with a small bridge in the middle for boating. Trees will be planted on the shore, and the situation will be like a small West Lake. In addition, houses will be built for men's and women's changing rooms, showers, restaurants, kitchens, etc. The green tiles and red walls are full of wild fun and are also expected to be completed in the summer. The company has also requested the Municipal Public Works Bureau to widen the road to the seaside, as it is too narrow, to avoid traffic accidents. The cost will be borne by the company.</p>
<p>Floating Hotel</p>
<p>Since its opening, the Floating Hotel at the company's Beijing Road pier has been crowded with women, breaking the record for newly opened hotels. Every day, no less than one hundred people are turned away due to lack of seating. The company has had to expand the special waiting room into a dining room and convert the original office into a waiting room. The office will have to be moved to the lower level.</p>

<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that it was previously rumored that Japanese tea merchants, in order to further develop their economic presence in China, had collected 500,000 yuan to establish a large-scale tea factory in Shanghai. They planned to purchase new tea in tea-producing areas such as Anhui and Hangzhou, re-bake it with new-style baking machines, and pay attention to improving the color and aroma, especially for sales in Southeast Asia, in order to completely seize the Chinese market. The reporter interviewed Chen Zhou, a supervisor of the Tea Association, and Fan Jun of the Tea Group of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, who both unanimously denied this news, saying that this rumor had been circulating last winter and was not true.</p>

<p>The Major Fishery Market, built by the Ministry of Industry in Yangshupu, Shanghai, has been under construction since last year. Most of the building has been completed, and the electrical and heating equipment has also been installed. The bidding for the cold storage section began last month, and the contract was awarded to the American York Company.

<p>Xu Changshan, a native of Changzhou, is 25 years old and resides at No. 27 Ziyang Lane, Wuding Road, in western Shanghai. He was previously a teacher at Huacheng Elementary School in Xinkaihe, Nanshi. Last night, at around 7:30 PM, while having dinner at home, he had a dispute with his parents regarding marriage. After the meal, he suddenly had suicidal thoughts and secretly swallowed raw opium. His mother discovered this and immediately hired a car to send him to Baolong Hospital. After examination and treatment by the doctor, fortunately, the poisoning was slight and he was declared out of danger.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Person Involved in Homicide Case Acquitted After Appeal; Still Detained During Appeal Period <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Jiang Guoxing, formerly an informant for a detective, was implicated in the shooting assassination of Yong native Gu Qingbao (also known as Chen Aqing) at approximately 5:30 PM on January 29, 1933, in Yuanfang Lane, Yuanfang Road, Hongkou. The police requested the First Special Court to issue an arrest warrant. Later, a Chinese detective from the Putuo Road police station arrested Gu and delivered him to the Special Court for interrogation. Gu Qingbao was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment. Gu, dissatisfied with the initial trial verdict, hired a lawyer to appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court. The interrogation has concluded, and yesterday at 2:30 PM, Presiding Judge Yu Hua, along with Judges Zhou and Xiao, announced the verdict in court. The main text stated: "The original verdict is revoked; Gu Qingbao is not guilty." The Shanghai Municipal Council lawyer, Gan Jingxian, requested that Gu be detained during the appeal period. The court approved this, and the police took Gu back to the police station for continued detention.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Truck Driver's Negligence Leads to Death of Garbage Cart Driver <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The case was inspected by the court and prosecuted by the police. Bai Xuehuai, a native of Jiancheng County, Jiangbei, 21 years old, lived at No. 129 Malan Road in the French Concession. He worked as a garbage cart pusher for the Shanghai Municipal Council in the Public Concession. In the early morning of the previous day, at around 5:00 AM, Bai was pushing cart No. 8 on the east side of Yuyuan Road, heading east on the north side of the road. Another garbage cart, No. 10, pushed by Guo Shimin, was also traveling west on the south side of the road. Unexpectedly, a truck with license plate No. 9778 from the Tanle Motor Company, driven by Gu Sihai, sped up from behind Guo's cart. Seeing the impending collision, Gu attempted to avoid it by turning the truck north. However, due to his lack of driving skills, he instead crashed into garbage cart No. 8 and severely injured Bai. The Jing'an Temple police station received a report and immediately dispatched detectives to apprehend Gu and bring him to the police station. They also summoned an ambulance to rush the injured Bai to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and he died shortly after. The body was transported to the autopsy center on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, the police first escorted Gu to the First Special District Court and filed a public prosecution according to the law, requesting an extension of the case pending autopsy results. At around 10:00 AM, Prosecutor Tang, appointed by the Prosecutor's Office, along with Forensic Doctor Wei, Clerk Wang Zuyi, and others, arrived at the autopsy center to examine the body. After confirming the body, they took their seats for the official case. The Western police first reported the previous events, stating that the road was approximately 32.2 feet wide. At the time, garbage cart No. 10 was about 5.6 feet from the street edge, and cart No. 8 was about 4.6 feet from the street edge. Therefore, the truck's passage on the road should not have resulted in a collision, indicating the driver's negligence in causing the accident. They therefore filed a lawsuit in accordance with the law. Prosecutor Tang then briefly interrogated the witness Guo Shimin and the truck driver Gu Sihai. It was then decreed that the deceased, Bai Xuehuai, a male, had indeed died from injuries sustained from being struck by truck No. 9778. In addition to the truck driver Gu Sihai being suspected of professional negligence resulting in death, since the family of the deceased had not yet arrived, the body was temporarily handed over to the Pushan Villa for preservation.</p>

<p>Yu Li, a native of Qingkou, was carrying a paper package containing a French-made automatic handgun and one hundred rounds of ammunition at 10:15 AM on the previous day. He was walking along Tangshan Road, Lane 310, intending to sell them somewhere. Xu Bingnan and Zhang Youming, Chinese detectives from the Huishan Police Station, noticed his suspicious behavior and stopped him. Upon opening the paper package, they discovered the aforementioned firearms and ammunition, and brought him to the police station. The police chief ordered his detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Shanghai Municipal Council lawyer Li Zhishan presented the previous events. Detectives Xu and Zhang then reported the circumstances of the arrest of the defendant and presented the firearms and ammunition for inspection. When questioned, the defendant confessed that Wang Agui, who was at large, had asked him to take them to Xiao Zhuan, a carpenter in Hongzhen, Zhabei, stating the price as thirty-two yuan and promising a reward of one yuan. Yu stammered and begged for leniency. Judge Wu Zehan ordered him to be detained and scheduled a new hearing for further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e161">After Female Servant Ni Lin Met Her Death Through Assault, Her Husband Sues Multiple People; He Sues Seven People Based on the Words of Fellow Villagers, Demanding Coffin Transport Fees and Damages <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Ni Lin, a woman from Hefei, Anhui, was 45 years old and worked as a servant for Chen Li, a Fujianese woman at No. 4 Mingde Lane, Huanlong Road, in the French Concession. On March 1st of this year, after dinner, she went out to hang out with fellow villagers Sister Han Si and Sister Wang, women living in the upper floor of No. 137 Pushi Road. While dumping dirty water, she splashed a ruffian, Fei Jinhai, nicknamed "Little Cifantuan" from Chongming. Fei, together with Zhang Xiaomao, a Haimen native watching the alley at No. 25 Zhengyuan Lane, Beidi Road, dragged Lin into the middle of the road and beat her, causing injuries to the back of her head and abdomen. The attackers fled the scene. Later, Sister Han Si and others helped Lin up and sent her to her employer's house, falsely claiming that she had been hit by a car. The master wanted to send her to the hospital, but Lin refused and did not want to seek treatment. The employer, Chen Li,</p>
<p>Recognizing her grave responsibility</p>
<p>And unable to bear it, immediately notified Fang Lin, the female owner of the employment agency at No. 53 Beidi Road, who went to take the injured Ni Lin to the agency to sleep. The next morning, Ni Lin died of her injuries. The shop owner, Fang Lin, after consulting with the maid Luo Geng, took advantage of the sparse traffic in the early morning to carry the corpse out and abandon it in the Chunkuili Lane next door, hoping to shirk responsibility. Later, the alley manager reported it to the French police station, who dispatched investigators and learned that she had died from assault injuries. They immediately transported the body to the autopsy center and reported to the Second Special Court to send personnel to verify the cause of death. The relatives of the deceased collected the body, and the murderers, Little Cifantuan, i.e., Fei Jinhai, Zhang Xiaomao, and those who</p>
<p>Abandoned the corpse</p>
<p>Fang Lin and Luo Geng, were arrested and sent to the Second Special Court. The police department's lawyer filed a public prosecution based on the crimes of causing death by injury and abandoning the corpse, in accordance with the criminal law. Presiding Judge Wang Gangxu repeatedly held court sessions for investigation and interrogation. Fang Lin and Luo Geng were represented by lawyers hired by the servants' employment agency association, while lawyers were appointed by the court for Fei and Zhang to defend them. These matters have been reported previously. This case has now concluded its trial. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the Presiding Judge of the Second Special Court arrived at the First Criminal Court and ordered the defendants to be brought to the case. Fei Jinhai was sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment and deprivation of public rights for twelve years for causing death by injury. Zhang Xiaomao was sentenced for</p>
<p>Assisting in injury</p>
<p>Causing death, to seven years of imprisonment and deprivation of public rights for seven years. Fang Lin and Luo Geng were acquitted. During the appeal period, Fei and Zhang were detained in the detention center pending further instructions. Fang Lin and Luo Geng were allowed bail. Ni Jikuan, the husband of the deceased Ni Lin, received news from his hometown in Hefei and rushed to Shanghai. Based on what he was told by fellow villagers Xu Shaoqing (unemployed, residing at No. 137 Pushi Road), Wang Peiyin (tailor, residing at No. 6 Albert Road), and his wife's fellow villagers, Sister Han Si and Sister Wang (both residing at No. 137 Pushi Road, where the deceased went to hang out the night of the incident, which led to the disaster), that Little Cifantuan Fei Jinhai, Zhang Xiaomao, and others, were</p>
<p>Residing on Pushi Road</p>
<p>And were instigated to assault and cause death by Xiao A Mei, Bao San, Liang Du, A Xing, and the owner of Shunxing Water and Electricity Company at No. 128 Pushi Road, and the owner of Yuanmaosheng Hotel at No. 135 Pushi Road. Furthermore, the employer Chen Li did not agree to send her to the hospital or pay her wages at the time, deliberately abandoning her, resulting in her death, etc. Ni Jikuan immediately reported this to the French police station, requesting their arrest and interrogation. The police station rejected the report because Ni's report was based entirely on empty claims and lacked any supporting evidence. Ni, still not satisfied, hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, accusing Xiao A Mei, Bao San, Liang Du, A Xing, the owner of Shunxing Water and Electricity Company, the owner of Yuanmaosheng Hotel, and the employer Chen Li, etc., seven people, of</p>
<p>Inciting injury</p>
<p>Abandonment, etc., requesting their trial, and attached a civil suit, seeking compensation for the coffin transportation back to his hometown for burial of five hundred yuan, and compensation for lost wages of nine hundred and fifty yuan, totaling one thousand four hundred and fifty yuan, to be borne jointly by the defendants, Little Cifantuan, and Zhang Xiaomao. The court accepted the complaint, and yesterday, Judge Zhang Chaozuo opened the Second Criminal Court to summon the parties. The plaintiff Ni Jikuan, accompanied by a lawyer, and witnesses Xu Shaoqing, Wang Peiyin, Han Si, and Wang, four men and women, arrived at the court. The first three defendants, Xiao A Mei, Bao San, and Liang Du, did not arrive. A Xing (surnamed Zhang, only eleven years old), Wang Youwen, the owner of Shunxing Water and Electricity Company, Chen Guanghan, the owner of Yuanmaosheng Hotel, and Chen Li, four people, were summoned to the court. Ni Jikuan, the plaintiff, first stated his</p>
<p>Reasons for the lawsuit</p>
<p>The judge said to Ni, "The murderers Fei Jinhai and Zhang Xiaomao have already been convicted. Now you are accusing seven defendants, even including the child and the employer. Who exactly instigated the crime? Causing death is a serious matter and cannot be accused lightly." Ni claimed, "The witnesses told me. I was in the countryside at the time. After receiving the news, I came to Shanghai to investigate the matter. Xu Shaoqing, Wang Peiyin, and the other four witnesses told me. Otherwise, I am unfamiliar with this place and do not know the defendants, so how would I know the details?" The judge then questioned the defendant Zhang A and obtained his testimony. "I was not at the scene when they fought at No. 135 Pushi Road." Wang Youwen, the owner of Shunxing Water and Electricity Company (with a pockmarked face), testified, "I was not in the shop when the fight occurred. When I returned to the shop, the fight had already ended. I saw a patrolman and</p>
<p>Two foreigners</p>
<p>Came, and a car was parked nearby. Later, I saw the person who had been beaten get into the car and leave towards Avenue Joffre." Chen Guanghan, the owner of Yuanmaosheng Hotel, operated his hotel downstairs at No. 135 Pushi Road. The upstairs was occupied by people from Anhui, whom he did not know. He had something to attend to when the fight broke out and only returned at around 1:00 AM, when he learned about the fight. These three all denied instigating the beating. Chen Li testified, "Ni Lin worked as a servant in my house for only twenty-one days. That evening, after dinner, she went out without even washing the dishes. At around 9:00 PM, three women brought her back, saying that she had been hit in the back of the head by a car and had toothpaste applied to it. I said I would send her to the hospital, but they refused to go. Since she was living in my house, it was inconvenient, so I asked the person living with me to notify the employment agency, and the</p>
<p>The landlady</p>
<p>Came to take her away." After the testimony was completed, a written statement was presented to the court. At this point, the judge summoned the witness Xu Shaoqing, who testified, "I am blind in one eye and cannot see clearly. At the time, I only saw many people fighting. Wang Peiyin told me that a pockmarked face told them to hit him. So I knew that the pockmarked face was the owner of Shunxing Water and Electricity Company." Wang Peiyin testified, "At the time, I was upstairs and saw Little Cifantuan fighting with a pockmarked face. Another pockmarked face, i.e., the owner of Shunxing Water and Electricity Company, was standing nearby yelling at them to fight. He did not lay a hand on them himself. I did not see the child A Xing there." Sister Wang testified, "I lived on the upper floor of Yuanmaosheng Hotel. That night, Ni Lin came, stood on the handrail, holding a teacup. Someone below said that water had splashed on them and cursed. Little Cifantuan then came up and took Ni Lin's</p>
<p>Teacup from her hand</p>
<p>Ni Lin also cursed back and went downstairs, and was then grabbed and beaten by them. I rushed out to persuade them, and it was Little Cifantuan and Little Mao who were beating her. Seeing the patrolman coming, they fled. Wang Youwen was standing nearby yelling at them to fight. The hotel owner and A Xing were standing on the side. Later, I accompanied Ni Lin to her employer's house. Chen Li refused to send her to the hospital and also refused to pay her wages." Sister Wang's testimony was the same as Sister Han Si's. The judge then asked the plaintiff Ni Jikuan if he had anything else to say. Ni claimed, "Now that the person is dead and the coffin cannot be transported back for burial, I myself cannot even go home. I ask the court to be the judge." The judge said, "Two individuals have already been convicted in this case. You</p>
<p>Want to extort money</p>
<p>You won't be able to get it. Shanghai is different from the county magistrate's office in the interior. In the countryside, you can threaten people for money, and if you don't get the money, you sue them. You can seek damages from the two already convicted, but you can't just randomly accuse seven defendants based on empty words." The lawyer representing the plaintiff then supplemented his opinion. The court ruled that the defendants were not all present and the case required further investigation. The fifth defendant, Wang Youwen, the owner of Shunxing Water and Electricity Company, was ordered to provide a guarantor who could be summoned at any time, or else he would be detained. The lawyer representing the plaintiff was also informed that the names of the fifth and sixth defendants, the owner of Shunxing Water and Electricity Company and the owner of Yuanmaosheng Hotel, were not listed on the complaint, which did not comply with legal procedure, and that a supplementary complaint should be submitted to the court for further summons. The court adjourned after this.</p>

<p>Lu Bohong, a great philanthropist in this city, recognized the lack of large-scale mental hospitals in the country, causing those suffering from mental illnesses to have nowhere to seek medical treatment. Therefore, he invested in the establishment of a model asylum, which has now been completed and is scheduled to start accepting patients on the first of next month. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Complete Completion: The hospital is located in Beiqiao Town, this city, covering an area of more than ten acres. Construction began in the autumn of last year, and the project was fully completed at the end of March this year. It is named Puji Sanatorium. The hospital is located in a secluded area with fresh air and no noise from vehicles, making it a perfect place for patients to recuperate.

<p>Madam Jin Jinghua, the esteemed wife of Mr. Zheng Hongnian, passed away at 8:50 AM on the 8th at her residence in Nanjing, Hunan Road, Dajing Lane, due to chronic cough and heart disease. This old illness relapsed this time and lasted only three days, with medical treatment proving ineffective. She was 61 years old. Her second brother, Zheng Baonan, who serves in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and her many children were all at her residence in Nanjing to attend to her illness and see her off. Her eldest son, Zheng Baozhao, who serves as deputy director of the Beining Railway, heard the news in Tianjin and rushed back to Nanjing by train.

<h3 id="e170">Dredging the Wusong River to Change to Using Dredgers for Construction; Shipping Will Resume as Soon as the Machines Arrive and the Dam is Opened <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>In order to dredge the Wusong River, the Taihu Lake Conservancy Commission broke the dam for work on April 1st in the area of Yujidun Zhuangjia Lane. However, half of the rice boats and manure boats in Shanghai came from this route. After the dam was broken, the rice boats had to take a detour around the Southern Huangpu River, which took three days longer than usual. The manure boats, because the boats were too small, could not detour around the big port. Therefore, in addition to farmers from the Zhenru Beixinjing area of Zhabei coming to Shanghai to buy, the other areas of Huangdu, Qingpu, etc., have completely disappeared, causing a yellow panic in Zhabei. The drivers, having nowhere to dump, dumped the manure into the Huangpu River and sewers. The Shanghai Municipal Government, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and the Nanjing Municipal Government believe that this matter is related to hygiene and endangers public order, so they negotiated with the Taihu Lake Conservancy Commission to change to using dredgers to dredge the river in order to maintain shipping. After the Taihu Lake Conservancy Commission submitted a request to the National Economic Commission for instructions, it was decided to use machine dredging. Once the authorities transport the machinery to Shanghai, the dam can be opened. The commission also announced to all sectors of society: "It is hereby announced that the project to dredge the Yujidun section of the Wusong River was previously scheduled to break the dam on April 1st and was announced in the newspapers. Now, in order to maintain ship traffic, it has been approved by the National Economic Commission to change to machine dredging. All sectors of society are hereby notified accordingly."</p>

<p>Zhu Jianqiu, the owner of the Zhenru Family Food Company, was brutally subjected to illegal torture by the Zhenru Police Station and died unjustly. After the case was uncovered, the local court sentenced Police Chief Zhou Pingyuan and police officer Xing Guonong to ten years of imprisonment each and ordered them to pay a private claim of 2,000 yuan and 304 yuan for clothing, coffins, and funeral expenses. These details have been reported previously. It is now learned that after the verdict was rendered, the two defendants, Zhou and Xing, were detained pending further instructions. In recent days, the two defendants have repeatedly submitted statements requesting bail during the appeal period. Therefore, Judge Shao Qinzhi opened a court session yesterday and ordered Zhou Pingyuan and Xing Guonong, the two defendants, to be brought to the case. They all testified, requesting the court to grant bail to allow them to go out pending further instructions, stating that they would not escape and requesting the court to grant their request. After hearing the testimony, the judge ruled, "Your request for bail is difficult to grant. The case is serious and there is a large private claim. Moreover, you are currently in the appeal period and should wait quietly for the High Court to interrogate you. Do not make any further requests." After the judge finished speaking, he ordered the court clerk to take them back to detention separately. When Zhou Pingyuan left the courtroom, he frowned, stomped his feet frequently, and repeatedly called himself unlucky.</p>
<h3 id="e172">New Zha Sub-Bureau: Deceased Gambling Offender Was Prepared for Burial Yesterday; Wife Requests Exemption from Autopsy; One Person Punished with Fine <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Last month, on the 6th, according to Inspector Li Qingjie of the Tanzi Bay Police Station under the Zhabei New Zha Sub-bureau, nine people, including gambling offender Yan Fusheng (also known as Yan Fusheng), were arrested and brought in. After Officer Ouyang Liu sentenced them to detention, Yan Fusheng died due to illness, which was reported in the newspapers. Now, it is learned that during the coroner's examination, the deceased's brother, Yan Lousheng, suspected that his brother's sudden death was suspicious. Therefore, Prosecutor Zhao Chuanjia immediately ordered the local guarantor, Li Ruiru, to transport the body to the Zhenru Forensic Autopsy Institute for an autopsy. Yesterday morning, Yan Lousheng suddenly filed a petition with the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office, accompanied by the deceased's wife, Qiao, stating that they had come to Shanghai from a remote area in Jiangbei and were in a hurry and panic, unaware of the truth. Therefore, they mistakenly claimed that the cause of death was unclear and raised doubts. They now know that the deceased, Yan Fusheng, died of suffocation due to phlegm and earnestly request exemption from sending the body to the Zhenru Autopsy Institute for an autopsy. After receiving the petition, Prosecutor Zhao, based on the repeated requests from the deceased's family for exemption from sending the body to the Zhenru Forensic Autopsy Institute for an autopsy, granted their request and issued a certificate stating that the deceased, Yan Fusheng, indeed died of illness and that the deceased's family could prepare a coffin for burial. Therefore, yesterday afternoon at 2:20 PM, the wife of the deceased took the body away for burial. The coffin has already been loaded onto a boat and transported back to Jiangbei for burial. The deceased is survived by a son and a daughter. The young son, named Gen Shun, is ten years old, and the elder daughter, named A Mao, is sixteen years old. It is also learned that among the nine gambling offenders in the same group, besides the deceased Yan Fusheng, there is also Wang Changfu, who is a member of the Fire Brigade. At that time, Director Ruan approved him to pay a fine in lieu of detention. The remaining seven people, Wang A Jin, Yuan A Bao, Liu A Er, Wang Xiao Sanzi, Xiao Dengjie, Yang Yingen, and Yang Fujun, were still detained at the Zhabei Branch of the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau yesterday afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e173">American United Life Insurance Company Shareholders' Meeting <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>The American United Life Insurance Company held its annual shareholders' meeting at its headquarters on the Bund at number 17 yesterday. Mr. Starr, the chairman, read and approved the minutes of the previous meeting. The board of directors reported on the company's business performance last year. Fei Mengde, Bei Shiyi, Hu Leiwen, Xue Deshi, and Starr ((CV) Shi Kelei Starr (NV)) were re-elected as directors. The main points of the report were as follows: The company's business made considerable progress last year, with new business reaching 12,540,537.00 national currency. After deducting overdue policy surrenders and maturity refunds, the net profit was 3,559,189.56 yuan. The total effective insurance amount, as of November 31st last year, exceeded 56,683,892.79 Shanghai taels. Western life insurance actuaries have long debated the mortality rate of the Eastern population without reaching a consensus. According to statistics compiled over many years and recent data on the Japanese mortality rate, the general conclusion is that the mortality rate of the Far Eastern population is far higher than that of Europe and America. However, based on the experience of American United Life Insurance Company in China for the past fourteen years, this statement is not accurate. According to the company's analysis of the mortality rate of its policyholders, the conclusions are as follows: (1) In the recent two or three decades, due to the improvement of the lifestyle of Chinese people, the invention of modern medicine, the increase of hygiene knowledge, and the equipment of modern hospitals, the population mortality rate has indeed decreased, especially in the major cities where the company is located. Chinese people with good economic conditions and good health habits tend to live long lives and have a natural resistance to certain diseases that Westerners cannot match. (2) According to the company's fourteen years of experience, the average number of deaths is only 61% of the expected number, and only 60% last year. The reason why the performance is better than other companies is due to the perfection of doctors' examination equipment. Recently, Western companies have increased premiums or reduced dividends, but as a result of the lower mortality rate in the Far East, the collection of premiums may be reduced in the future. Insurance companies sprang up in the United States from 1845 to 1860 and have now become the largest and most powerful companies in the country. Last year, insurance companies also emerged in China and the Philippine Islands. Their future achievements are bound to be considerable. The company believes that this phenomenon is a manifestation of Eastern people gradually understanding the benefits of life insurance. The directors are convinced that constructive cooperation, rather than malicious protection or destructive competition, can promote the life insurance business in China. Therefore, within the scope of cooperation and assistance with the company, they will be encouraged and assisted to promote the entire life insurance business and benefit the countries where the business is located. Today is the 14th annual shareholders' meeting of American United Life Insurance Company. American United Life Insurance Company will have a history of fifteen years, so it can no longer be called a small life insurance company. Each year, the company not only gradually increases its business volume and stability, but also its organizational efficiency is increasing day by day. When the company started its business, life insurance was completely unknown in China. Therefore, at that time, the company's creation of this business in China was of great importance. Today, the company has become a financial institution, and the responsibilities borne by its directors are increasing day by day, and its service opportunities have gradually expanded. After carefully examining the accounts of this session, everyone knows that the profit for 1934 was 370,635.04 yuan. Compared with the profit of 403,964.32 yuan in 1933, we should be very satisfied, because 1934 was in a very economic situation. The company's cash position is also very stable. The amount of cash in stock and deposited in banks reached 677,043.04 yuan. The amount of assets increased by 1,369.23 yuan in one year, of which 232,358.99 yuan was borrowed by policyholders with policy pledges, and the rest was investment. The average interest rate of the main investment was 5.8%. The exchange difference was 48,201.78 yuan, which has been included in the profit account. This difference could have been included in the silver reserve account, but the auditors and directors advocated that, at this time of current currency instability, the original reserve should still be maintained. This difference occurred because of the temporary difference in currency values between Shanghai and Hong Kong after the implementation of the Chinese silver export micro-tax regulations. However, the gap between the currency systems will gradually balance through natural economic capacity and continued remittances from Hong Kong. Last year, excluding expenses, 204,151.91 yuan was accumulated. Adding this year's operating profit, and subtracting dividends, exchange differences, and taxes, the amount available for distribution and other expenses this year is 371,580.25 yuan. The directors believe that the company's profits should be distributed to shareholders, but under today's unstable situation, it is necessary to temporarily pay extra dividends until a more significant solution to Shanghai's economic problems is achieved. However, the dividends to which policyholders are entitled will continue to be distributed at the current amount. The loyalty and enthusiasm of the managers and staff are the company's most valuable assets. Finally, I have to say a few words to commend them.</p>

<p>Special Announcement</p>
<h3 id="e182">Annual Business Report of Jin Cheng Bank for the Year 23 (27) <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>(C) Assisting Transportation Enterprises. The development of transportation enterprises is of profound importance to a country's economy. The Bank has always provided considerable services to railway transportation and also wants to help its engineering development and equipment improvement, so as to facilitate the circulation of products in the interior and make up for trade deficits externally, and promote the output of industries internally, so as to benefit the current economic situation of our country. The Bank's services to national roads this year, the major ones are as follows: (1) Loans for Construction. The Yuehan Railway is the main line connecting the north and south, the Tongxi Railway is the place where the products of the northwest gather and distribute, and the Lai Yupi Railway is the important line connecting the two provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangxi. This year, the government separately borrowed money from the banking group by mortgaging it to fill the construction and equipment needs. The total amount of the Yuping loan was 16 million yuan, the total amount of the Tongxi loan was 4.5 million yuan, and the total amount of the Han Yue loan was 1.5 million pounds in British gold. The Bank has shared a part of it with its peers. Now the construction of each road is progressing, and the Tongxi section of the Longhai Road has been completed. (2) Guarantee of Material Payments. Each road orders the materials needed for the improvement of engineering and equipment from foreign countries in installments. Foreign factories always need a letter of guarantee for payment from a reputable Chinese bank. The Bank uses this method to pay in installments, which can alleviate the financial resources of the road party and provide support for other equipment. Therefore, this year, it also jointly issued guarantees with its peers. To help the facilities of the road administration. The above is the general situation of the Bank's road administration services this year. However, a few years ago, due to the situation, the roads mostly defaulted on their debts. According to the investment principle, the Bank could not but temporarily suspend assistance. Recently, the government and the roads have actively reorganized their debts and developed their businesses, and can respect credit agreements and fulfill the terms and conditions. Therefore, they continue to invest to help construction. Also, this year, the Bank has also made considerable investments in the highways of various provinces, and it is shared with its peers.</p>
<p>(7) Personnel and Training of the Bank in Year 23</p>
<p>The work of modern banking business focuses on both quantity and quality. Considering the increase in the total amount, the staff will inevitably be used more, and in order to improve the quality, the staff must be trained. Now, the Bank's staff number comparison and staff training situation this year are briefly described below: (A) Staff Number Comparison. In Year 13, the total number of staff in the Bank was 553, an increase of 86 from the previous year. However, the Bank's employment policy is now mainly based on examinations. Except for certain necessary personnel in business, talents with considerable knowledge and experience are still used, and the rest are based on examinations to emphasize selection. Therefore, the newly added personnel this year accounted for 70% of the examinations. (B) Student Training. (1) Practical Training. Last year, the Bank recruited 11 graduates from the Department of Economics and Commerce of various universities in Pinghu and Shanghai. The Department of Economics of Nankai University specially set up a class for training on practical applications. This year's examination results were excellent and they were assigned to various banks to work. Also, this year, the authorities of various universities recommended a total of 15 excellent graduates from the Department of Economics and Commerce of the school. It is also advisable to add a little training on practical affairs. They are still hired by Nanda professors to provide corresponding guidance. After the examination, the results are excellent and they are assigned to various banks for trial use. (2) Field Practice. The Bank's Pinghu and Han branches have been busy with business and there are not enough people assigned to the above-mentioned personnel. Therefore, 36 graduates from high school and vocational schools were recruited from the three places and practiced directly in the banks. (3) Morning Village Service Training. In order to assist the rural economy, the Bank should train corresponding talents. This year, it happened to be the opening of the agricultural training class of the North China Agricultural Production Research and Improvement Society in Ding County. The Bank also sent people to the class to receive training together, and is now using it for agricultural services. (To be continued)</p>

Furthermore, the Ministry of Education feels that there are many difficulties in promoting national physical education, so we have gathered everyone to discuss solutions in order to increase the effectiveness of promotion. At the same time, we have invited the directors of physical education venues from various provinces and cities to participate in the meeting and share their opinions.

<h3 id="e186">Reports from the Directors <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing: Zhang Zhongfan, Director of the Nanjing Public Physical Education Venue, reported that although the Nanjing Physical Education Venue is located in the urban area of Nanjing, it is under the jurisdiction of Jiangsu Province. The venue covers 80.5 mu (approximately 13.3 acres), which is located in the southeast of the city, which is not very convenient. The annual funding is 14,000 yuan. The organization is divided into two departments: guidance and administration. In 1928, the number of people entering the venue for sports was 40 to 70 per day, which increased to 140 to 180 in 1930. The equipment of the physical education venue is not very complete, and the army often borrows the venue for exercises. Now it has been restricted to supply in the morning, and the maximum limit is until 3 pm. The career is gradually progressing, but it is hoped that the venue will be jointly operated by the Provincial Education Department, the Nanjing Municipal Government, and the Ministry of Education, so that it can become a trial physical education venue suitable for the city.</p>
<p>Henan: Gu Yuqi, Director of the Kaifeng Physical Education Venue in Henan Province, reported that the venue began construction during the 16th North China Games in Henan in 1931 and was completed in 1932. The construction cost was over 100,000 yuan. The form is relatively old and there are many inconveniences. The surrounding area is more than 120 mu (approximately 19.8 acres), divided into track and field and ball games. The stands and the rostrum are built in the middle of the ball field, with five tennis courts, three basketball courts, two volleyball courts, one football field, and a children's playground in the track and field field. There is also room for building a swimming pool and a gymnasium, which is being planned by the Provincial Education Department. The funding was more than 500 yuan per month in 1932, which increased to 713 yuan in 1933. The organization is divided into two departments: guidance and administration. In terms of career, the annual folk sports meeting is the most grand.</p>
<p>Qingdao: Zhang Yixian, Director of the Qingdao Public Physical Education Venue, reported that the venue was built during the North China Games in 1932, with a cost of 160,000 yuan. The area is more than 120 hectares, with a circumference of 400 meters. The stands can accommodate 20,000 people. The track and field field and ball field are complete. The funding is relatively fixed. Qingdao's education fee is 600,000 yuan per year, of which 60,000 yuan is for social education. The social education fee allocates 12,000 yuan for physical education. The physical education venue's funding is 5,000 yuan per year. In terms of career, all kinds of attention is paid to the fact that Qingdao's physical education is quite developed.</p>
<p>Shanghai: Xiang Xianggao reported on behalf of the Shanghai First Physical Education Venue. The venue was opened in 1913 and originally belonged to the county. It was transferred to the city in 1928 and managed by the Education Bureau. The current annual funding is 9,552 yuan. The venue covers 26 mu (approximately 4.3 acres), with an actual area of 20 mu (approximately 3.3 acres) excluding the buildings. The four sides are all city houses and cannot be expanded. The internal equipment is simple, with one football field, one basketball court, two tennis courts, and one martial arts room. The organization is the same as other venues. All aspects of the career are paid attention to, but it is a pity that the venue is small and there are many athletes.</p>
<p>Jiangsu: Wu Bangwei, Director of the Zhenjiang Physical Education Venue in Jiangsu Province, reported that the venue's annual funding is 17,000 yuan. Although it is more than other places, it still feels lacking in terms of career. The organization is divided into two departments: guidance and promotion. A lot of promotion has been done in terms of career, but how to make people in the industrial and commercial sectors have the opportunity to participate is hoped to be paid attention to together, and the physical education career is only solely responsible by the physical education venue, which is weak.</p>
<p>Zhejiang: Zhu Jiasheng, Director of the Hangzhou Physical Education Venue in Zhejiang Province, reported that the venue was built during the National Games in 1930 and has now been expanded. It is quite suitable for large-scale sports meets. The funding is more than 900 yuan per month, and it has now become a place where various sports meets are borrowed. There are 16 physical education venues in various counties in Zhejiang Province that belong to the counties, and 160 that belong to the folk education centers in various counties. Although the number is large, many are nominal.</p>
<p>Hubei: Ke Nanshan, Director of the Wuchang Physical Education Venue in Hubei Province, reported that the venue already existed during the National Games in 1924, but it was not managed until 1931 and became a horse racing venue for soldiers. It was not until 1933 that Chen Qibao, Director of the Education Department, paid attention to physical education and established the venue. The monthly funding is 300 yuan, which increased to 360 yuan in 1934. The equipment includes three basketball courts, two volleyball courts, four tennis courts, and one football field and track and field field each. There is a great lack of a gymnasium and swimming pool.</p>
<p>Hunan: Huang Fengqi, Director of the Changsha Physical Education Venue in Hunan Province, reported that the venue's annual funding is 1,700 yuan, which is also subject to an 80% discount. It was established in 1930. The venue is very large. Every time a career is held, it cooperates with other sports organizations. It has greatly promoted public sports in the banking, book, and seafarer sectors. It is now preparing to host the Central China Games next year, so it plans to expand its equipment.</p>
<p>Shandong: Shang Shumei, Director of the Jinan Physical Education Venue in Shandong Province, reported that the venue already existed in 1923, and the scale was larger in 1931. The construction cost was 80,000 yuan, covering an area of more than 100 mu (approximately 16.5 acres). The funding is 12,180 yuan, which has now been reduced to 10,824 yuan, with more than 900 yuan per month. The public who come to the venue include students, civil servants, and other sectors.</p>
<p>Hebei: Zhao Wenzao, Director of the Tianjin Physical Education Venue in Hebei Province, reported that the venue was built for the North China Games. The scale is relatively large and is not far from Tianjin City. The environment is very good. Except for the swimming pool, the equipment is complete. It is now kept by the Hebei Provincial Education Department, so the Education Department sent a custodian. The funding is 388 yuan, or 4,560 yuan per year. The area is 200 mu (approximately 33 acres). The construction cost, including the foundation, is 320,000 yuan. The venue is large, and there are many buildings, but there are few staff members, so it is difficult to manage. It is now being used as an auditorium for provincial and municipal conferences and as a school sports venue.</p>
<p>Jiangxi: Yu Yongzuo, Director of the Nanchang Physical Education Venue in Jiangxi Province, reported that the venue was reorganized and established in 1933, with 10,068 yuan per year. A lot of work has been done in the past two years. The Education Department can also have an additional subsidy of 10,000 yuan per year. The equipment includes four football fields, seven basketball courts, six tennis courts, one martial arts field, one handball field, one children's playground, one small swimming pool, and one equipment field for adults. The stands can accommodate 3,000 people. It is now planned to build a gymnasium and swimming pool, with a budget of 50,000 yuan. More than 1,500 people come to the venue every day.</p>
<p>Guangdong: Xu Minhui reported on behalf of the Guangdong Provincial Sports Venue. The venue is managed by the Education Department's Physical Education Committee and has no director. It covers an area of 200 mu (approximately 33 acres). The sports field has been drawn, and the seats can accommodate 3,000 people. The remaining equipment is being planned, with a prepared cost of more than 3 million yuan. The current monthly funding is 1,500 yuan, which is allocated by the provincial government. Public sports have a considerable development in Guangdong, and military sports are particularly developed.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Wu Bangwei Talks About Improving Social Sports <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Start with expanding and reorganizing existing sports venues. Existing social education institutions should be arranged with sports environments.</p>
<p>Wu Bangwei, Director of the Zhenjiang Physical Education Venue in Jiangsu Province, came to Shanghai this time to attend the joint meeting of sports directors from various provinces convened by the Ministry of Education. A Shanghai social reporter specially visited him yesterday. According to him, his views on improving social sports are very detailed, and are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Fundamental Problems</p>
<p>Mr. Wu first said that the fundamental problems of improving social sports: (1) The entire social sports cannot be borne by a few sports people. How can the responsible persons of local administrative education be able to promote it with great effort? (2) In addition to the sports venues, there is no designated amount to seek development in social sports funds. Comparing the population of a city with the funds of a sports venue, the average cost per person per year is only a few cents or a few cents, and of course it cannot be developed. How to ensure that local social sports funds have a fixed budget? (3) The social living environment is like this, and the public's understanding of sports is like that. Social sports facilities do not have a correct object. How to enable the industrial and commercial sectors to have a fixed time every day to engage in sports?</p>
<p>Improvement Methods</p>
<p>Mr. Wu then talked about the improvement methods, saying that before the above-mentioned fundamental problems are solved, large-scale expansion of sports will definitely fail, be ineffective, and uneconomical. Therefore, expanding and reorganizing the existing sports venues, and setting up sports venues and equipment in existing social education institutions and public venues, is a suitable method for improving social sports today. Expanding and reorganizing existing sports venues must enrich economic equipment, use excellent talents, determine the minimum work items and the number of careers, and pay attention to children's sports with appropriate literacy and labor training. At the same time, students in public schools and private schools who lack sports training should be allowed to go to the sports venues at regular intervals to find a fixed object.</p>
<p>Social Education Institutions</p>
<p>As for setting up sports venues in existing social education institutions and public venues, first, all social education institutions such as folk and agricultural education halls should set up small-scale sports venues, which are managed by the recreation department. Second, increase the funds allocated to the Wu Agricultural Education Hall and designate them for sports and health facilities. Third, refer to the financial equipment situation and formulate career standards. Fourth, the public who receive fixed training at the folk and agricultural education halls should be given the opportunity to play games and sports appropriately, with a duration of seven or five minutes to twenty minutes each day or each time. Fifth, parks and special sports departments should set up ball fields and children's play equipment.</p>
<p>School Aspects</p>
<p>Mr. Wu finally said that in terms of the current school sports venues, it is not enough to provide extracurricular activities for the students of the school. It is actually difficult to open them to the public. All management guidance and consumption are extra things. Moreover, issuing an order to open the school without anyone to preside over and promote it, the public may not go to sports. However, it may be a preliminary attempt, that is, any sports competition held by the school should set up an open group. All registration procedures should be entrusted to the sports venues for handling. The school venues are used to occupy a part of the time, so that the public can have more opportunities to participate. Only in this way can it be successful and can we further plan to open school sports venues.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Jiangwan Six-Mile Cross-Country Run <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Fourteen teams of Chinese and foreigners participated. Waters was unable to come to Shanghai to participate due to an event. The list of participants from each team was released yesterday.</p>
<p>The Jiangwan six-mile team cross-country championship organized by the Westerners' Sports Association is scheduled to be held at 10:30 a.m. on the 14th (Sunday) at the west gate of Hongkou Park. There were originally as many as fifteen teams participating in the competition, but Waters, the champion of the previous edition, originally intended to come to Shanghai to participate, but unfortunately, he was unable to do so due to an event and had to give up. Therefore, only fourteen teams actually competed. There are five Chinese teams, including Shanghai United Team A and B, the Chinese Sports Association, the Huaguang Track and Field Team, and the Hongkou Cross-Country Team. The Westerners include Ennis Teams A, B, C, and D, French Army Teams A and B, Westerners' Sports Association Teams A and B, and the Russian Emigrants Team. It is generally agreed that the Russian Emigrants Team, Ennis, the French Army, and Shanghai United Team A are the strongest this time. However, Shanghai United Team has famous Jiangnan players such as Wang Zhilin, He Baoshan, Zhang Liang, Jin Zhongkang, etc., but they have no experience in the mud roads, fields, and ditches that the cross-country run passes through. Moreover, the Chinese have always been naturally inferior and lazy to practice. It is not easy to compete with experienced and strong enemies for a day. Therefore, our country has very little hope for the championship in this competition. The list of each team is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Westerners' Sports Association Team A: 1. Zhong Qibao, 2. Mai Han, 3. Ai Te Wu, 4. Shan Lun, 5. Xi Ming, 6. Men Tuo.</p>

<p>Shanghai United Team A: 13. Wu Hanzhang, 14. He Shishan, 15. Jin Shenkang, 16. Wang Zhenglin, 17. Zhang Liang, 18. Huai Yuan.</p>
<p>Russian Emigrants: 19. Lai Fu Qing Gu, 20. Yi Tian Yi Fu, 21. Che Che Li Fu, 22. Fei Ding, 23. Pan Du Luo Fu, 24. Fu Kai Si Kai.</p>
<p>French Army Team A: 25. Hai Fu, 26. Wan Li Ti, 27. Sai Sai De, 28. Na Sai Er, 29. Bo Tai, 30. Meng Yi Sai.</p>

<p>Ennis Team C: 49. Da Wei, 50. Mai Da, 51. Yi Die, 52. Lao Ji Si, 53. Hua Pan, 55. Ke Pan, French Army Team B: 55. Shi Tuo Pan, 56. Di Pan Ke, 57. Hua Ling, 58. Qu Lai, 59. Man Ling, 60. Ai Fa Tuo.</p>

<h3 id="e200">Students Use Domestic Products, Scheduled to Hold a Swearing-in Ceremony, Simultaneously Exhibiting Students' Domestic Products, and Soliciting Articles for General Mobilization and Persuasion <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the "Student Domestic Product Year Promotion Federation," organized by industrial, commercial, and educational circles in the city, has decided to hold a student domestic product use swearing-in ceremony at the Municipal Government Auditorium on the 18th of this month. At the same time, a student domestic product exhibition will be held. On that day, all students in the city will be generally mobilized to form a persuasion team and launch a student essay contest to expand publicity. The Central News Agency reporter inquired about the details as follows:</p>
<p>Reporting Process Scheduled to be Held</p>
<p>The Student Domestic Product Year Promotion Federation yesterday submitted a report to the Municipal Education Bureau, stating that it was requesting instructions to be issued to various schools to select representatives to participate in the swearing-in. The association noted that the dumping of foreign goods was increasing daily, and the amount of import surplus was alarming. If this continued, domestic industry and commerce would inevitably go bankrupt, and the future was worrying. Therefore, the association jointly organized this association with public groups in the city, hoping that students' inherent patriotism could lead all circles in promoting domestic products to save the interests of the country. The progress of the association has been reported on file. It has now been decided to hold a swearing-in ceremony for representatives of all large, medium, and small schools in the city at the Municipal Government Auditorium at 2 p.m. on April 18th. The Mayor is invited to attend and preside over the oath to set a good example and facilitate the process. Therefore, the Bureau is requested to notify all schools to select at least five representatives per hundred people, led by faculty members, to attend the meeting on time. The attached lyrics and registration forms are also sent for distribution to various schools. Before the swearing-in ceremony, the lyrics should be rehearsed to be sung at the time. The registration forms should be filled in and reported to the association within a limited time. It is believed that the authorities of various schools have always been enthusiastic about promoting domestic products and will certainly support this grand event. The association will be grateful if the request is approved.</p>
<p>Exhibition of Supplies Enthusiastic Participation</p>
<p>The association also decided to hold a student supplies exhibition at the Municipal Government Auditorium on that day. The exhibition period is tentatively set for one day, and may be extended if necessary. The association has now begun to solicit products from domestic manufacturers in the city for display. All products participating in the exhibition must be accompanied by clear descriptions and trademarks, but the style is not specified. As for the samples, each manufacturer can design and decorate them freely to enhance the visual effect. Manufacturers who wish to print publicity materials and gifts at the exhibition must send samples to the association for contact in advance. It is reported that more than 40 well-known domestic manufacturers have been recruited, and several applications for registration are still being received every day. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion at that time.</p>
<p>Expand Publicity Solicit Manuscripts</p>
<p>In order to expand publicity, the association will not only specially contract various newspapers to publish temporary special editions, but also send letters to schools at all levels to solicit manuscripts. The topic of the essay is determined by the author. First, the principals of each school select good works and send them to the association with a letter. Each school is limited to two volumes. The essay must be based on the student's personal standpoint, expressing opinions and contributing practical methods. The style of writing is not limited, but it must be written in regular script with new-style punctuation. If foreign paper is used, it will be rejected. The deadline for submissions is from now until April 15th. Manuscripts should be sent to the association at No. 80, Longhua Road. Prizes are available to encourage participation.</p>
<p>Organize Persuasion Teams Start Soliciting</p>
<p>In order to awaken citizens to use domestic products and promote domestic products, the association will not only hold a swearing-in ceremony and exhibit domestic products on that day, but also mobilize all students and boy scouts in the city to organize student persuasion teams and persuade people along the way to expand publicity. The association has sent letters to the Municipal Education Bureau and the Shanghai Boy Scouts Association to instruct schools to handle this matter. The association's target for recruiting members since the start has been 500,000 people, and it is reported that the number has exceeded half.</p>

<h3 id="e201">Year of Old Books <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Shu</p>
<p>Dear readers! Last year, the reading class generally recognized as the year of magazines. What will this year become? Looking at the three-month process in the publishing industry, I will try to create a name for you! "Year of Old Books."</p>
<p>On the one hand, booksellers are inheriting the sentiments of the magazine year, blindly competing in the market, and specialized intermediaries who rely on the sales of magazines have also emerged. On the other hand, they are stopping the publication of new books and only using the sale and reprinting of old books to decorate the facade. Books and books that were placed under real, historical evaluation are now rampant. This is precisely because "books" are a part of the enterprise and are governed by the natural law of periodic panic.</p>
<p>"Year of Old Books," as the name suggests, is old books. At present, more than half of the bookstores that specialize in publishing new books are holding price reductions and selling slightly soiled and damaged books at the lowest price. Booksellers watch blankly during the good market conditions, the "books" that were frantically published due to competition are piled up in large quantities, and they have to painfully cut prices to convert them into currency.</p>
<p>The other object of the "Year of Old Books," in terms of quality, is the competition of old and outdated books. One bookstore publishes the Collected Works of Yuan Zhonglang, and another bookstore publishes the Complete Works of Yuan Zhonglang. The reprinting competition between the Twenty-Five Histories and the Twenty-Six Histories, which led to litigation, etc., are the best examples that can be picked up at hand. Recently, a bookstore is calling for a literary system that compiles the new literary trends of the first ten years, which is a more clever move. Because reprinting old books is definitely less costly, at least there is no need to pay royalties; and the book price can be arbitrarily raised, and there is no danger of suffering any danger. However, because of the vastness of the pages and the high pricing, the book industry has been separated from the general reading class, and there is a trend to become a kind of decoration. In short, the rise of old books, on the one hand, is the decline of people engaged in the work of "books"; on the other hand, it is because the ability to purchase books is weak, and at the same time, there is no way to obtain books, which makes the reader class decline with wisdom. This fact is enough to cause cultural stagnation and decline, which is the most obvious thing.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Enlightenment <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Another Realm</p>
<p>Speaking of enlightenment, Christianity is probably no match for Buddhism and Taoism. The reason why religion is religion is that making people understand is an important element. Without enlightenment, there will be no infatuation, and there will be no faith. Religion cannot exist. "Oh, I see!" This is the "enlightenment" that is often encountered in ordinary life, but ordinary people cannot always be enlightened after one enlightenment. Although religious people are constantly reminding you: "Turning back is the shore," there are very few who can truly change their ways from then on. There are still those who jump into the Huangpu River for the second time.</p>
<p>Since there have been humans on Earth, religion has existed. The current religions generally advocate peace, but primitive religions were not like this. This change is, in my opinion, a major progress in the history of religion. Why is Islam not as powerful as Christianity? The steel knife that Muhammad held in his hand is very important. It is impossible to hold people's hearts by force, even if they can "eat," they will not truly wholeheartedly become your believers. It is more clever than him, but he still cannot get rid of "eating." Once everything comes to eating, there will always be choruses.</p>
<p>Then, doesn't all "enlightenment" have to start from "eating"? Not necessarily. There are plenty of people in the world who are enlightened because they have hit a wall when they eat. For example, Sakyamuni of Buddhism became enlightened because he was too full, but such examples are rare. Most of the "enlightenment" is for hunger. Only when the stomach is hungry can there be a real feeling of "enlightenment." At this time, "enlightenment" cannot be controlled by Muhammad, who holds a steel knife. The rebellions in history can be said to be the greatest expression of "enlightenment."</p>
<p>Religious people often say "this person is enlightened," which is equivalent to saying "this person is hungry." Therefore, the secular name for believers is "eating religion," which can be said to be the most thorough annotation. A sick person does not avoid seeing a doctor. I think religious people should also agree with this. Therefore, in summary, the root of "enlightenment" is "hunger." It develops in two directions: one is worldly, that is, believers; the other is worldly, that is, revolutionaries. Sakyamuni can be said to be the supreme believer of enlightenment. To put it bluntly, he is just a perverted "enlightenment."</p>
<h3 id="e203">On "Scholars Despise Each Other" (2) <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Around the fifth century AD, Southern literati paid special attention to the application of tones in literature. The Biography of Lu Jue in the History of the Southern Dynasties says: "During the Yongming period, writing was popular, and Shen Yue of Wuxing, Xie Tiao of Chenjun, and Wang Rong of Langya promoted each other in terms of temperament. Zhou Yong of Runan was good at recognizing sounds and rhymes. Yue and other articles all used palace sounds: using the four tones of level, rising, departing, and entering, to create rhymes, there are flat heads, upward tails, wasp waists, and crane knees. Among the five characters, the sounds and rhymes are all different: within two sentences, the notes of the scale are different; they cannot be increased or decreased, and the world calls it the Yongming style." Shen Yue believed that "since Ling Jun, there have been many generations, although the literary style has been slightly refined, this secret has not been seen. As for high words and wonderful sentences, they are all secretly in harmony with reason, not from thought." (On the Biography of Xie Lingyun in the Book of Song) He believed that "since ancient times, poets, how could they not know the difference between palace and feather, and the difference between business and sign; although they know the difference between the five tones, they do not know much about the differences and changes among them. Therefore, my humble opinion is that this secret has not been seen. Based on this, we know that the literati of the previous generations did not realize this point. If the tones and rhymes of articles are the same as the sounds and tunes of strings and pipes, then beauty and ugliness cannot be completely contradictory; it is like Ziye playing music, how can there be any intermittent and out-of-tune sounds? Comparing Luoshen to Chen Si's other odes is like a different work. Therefore, we know that when the heavenly machine is turned on, the rhythm will be adjusted automatically, and when the six emotions are stagnant, the tone will be dissonant." (Reply to Lu Jue's letter) And Zhong Rong, who was opposed to him, put forward another proposition: "In the past, Cao and Liu were almost the saints of literature, and Lu and Xie were the talents of the second style, who were keen on research and thinking. For thousands of years, they have never heard of the distinction between palace and business, and the theory of the four tones. Or some say that the former talents accidentally did not see it, how could it be? Let me try to say it: In ancient times, poems and hymns were all covered with gold and bamboo, so they could not be harmonized without tuning the five tones... Now that they are not covered with pipes and strings, why should they take the sound and rhythm? ... Wang Yuanchang created its head, and Xie Tiao and Shen Yue promoted its waves. The three sages may be the sons and grandsons of noble families, and they had literary debate since childhood. Therefore, the scholars admired it and tried to be precise, accumulating subtle details and specializing in mutual trampling. Therefore, they made the text restrained and hurt its true beauty. I think the literary system must be recited and read, and it must not be jerky. But if it is clear and smooth, and the tone is smooth, it is enough. As for the level, rising, departing, and entering, I am sick and cannot do it; the wasp waist and crane knees are already available in the neighborhoods." (Preface to the Book of Poetry) They only had such differences in opinion due to their partial attachment to literary skills, which led to endless attacks, which is also a phase of scholars despising each other.</p>
<p>Tolstoy said: "The artists of various schools slander and smear each other, just like the religious people of various schools. Look at the artists of various schools now, people of one school criticize people of another school: for example, in poetry, the old Romantic school excludes the Byronic school and the decadent school; the Byronic school excludes the Romantic school and the decadent school; the decadent school excludes the previous schools and the Symbolist school; the Symbolist school excludes the previous schools and the Magog school, and the Magog school excludes the above schools... The same is true in novels, dramas, paintings, and music." (On Art) Therefore, in Tolstoy's view of art, Shakespeare's plays cannot occupy any position. Even if we look at the opinions of poets on poetry in the Ming and Qing dynasties, there is the same tendency to diverge. Li Mengyang "advocated that writing must be from the Qin and Han dynasties, and poetry must be from the prosperous Tang dynasty, and those who are not are not allowed to speak." (Biography of Li in the History of Ming) He attacked Song poetry, saying that "poetry to the Tang dynasty, the ancient tune is dead. However, since the Tang dynasty, the tune can be sung, and the higher ones can still be covered with pipes and strings. The people of the Song dynasty focus on reason and not on tune, so the Tang tune is also dead. Huang (Tingjian) and Chen (Shidao) learn from Du Fu and are called masters; now their words are difficult and unfloral, like entering a temple and sitting on a mud and wood skeleton, even if the crown and clothes are the same as people, can they be called people?" (Preface to Mengyang's Can Yin) And the Temperament School attacked He and Li's theory of style, and the rhetoric was equally sharp. Yuan Zhonglang said: "Why must poetry be from the Tang dynasty, and why must it be early and prosperous? It is necessary to use those that come from temperament as true poetry. Temperament resides in the heart and dwells in the environment. When the environment is accidentally touched, the heart can capture it; what the heart wants to spit out, the wrist can transport it. ... Use the heart to capture the environment, and use the wrist to transport the heart, then temperament will be fully expressed; this is called true poetry, and why must it be from the Tang dynasty, and why must the early and prosperous be complacent?" Yuan Zicai said: "Yang Chengzhai said: 'People with low talent and clumsiness like to talk about style, but they do not understand interest, why? Style is an empty shelf, and it is easy to describe the tune, but interest specializes in writing temperament, which cannot be done without genius.' ... You must know that there is style and rhythm if there is temperament, and rhythm is not outside of temperament. Half of the three hundred poems are about working people and bereaved women, who express their feelings casually. Who makes the style? Who makes the rhythm? Can those who talk about style today go beyond their scope?" (Volume 1 of Suiyuan Poetry Talks) The style theory and the temperament theory are the two major schools of poetry theory, and with the addition of Wang Yuyang's charm theory, they are divided into three parts.</p>

<p>— Chi Xia</p>
<p>When I see a group of lively children jumping around on the ground, I immediately recall my own lost childhood. The impressions are so vague yet so clear – as vague as a dream I had, yet as clear as something I personally experienced.</p>
<p>More than twenty years ago, I too was as lively and happy as these little angels! Like a carefree little bird, flying in the open sky. When pain came, I would cry aloud; if I encountered unexpected joy, I would laugh endlessly. Even a small matter like watching a group of ants carrying things in a pile of rocks could occupy my absorbed attention for an hour or two. Not only did I find it interesting myself, but I would sometimes insist on dragging neighboring children to watch with me. When we were tired of watching and playing, we would pick up stones to help the defeated ones fight back against the victors. Then everyone would burst into laughter. Each person's face, bearing a compassionate envy, would reveal a triumphant benevolence. How honest are the hearts of children! If one were to say that there is such a thing as helping the weak and suppressing the strong in this world, then it can only be found in the souls of the young.</p>
<p>Sometimes, among us children, we would fall out over a small matter. However, after a short while, we would tacitly forget the minor rift immediately, and become as close as our own siblings. I remember once, because a friend insisted on helping the red ants invade the black ants' food supply, and I, who had always disliked the red ones, expressed my disagreement. The barbaric friend immediately started hitting me, and naturally, I fought back. For an entire day, we didn't speak to each other. But the next day, we made up again, forgetting the previous day's small rift completely. The hearts of children are flawless. Their external appearance and internal feelings can only reveal the same color. It's not like adults who can still smile at people even when they are angry!</p>
<p>Although children can be naughty, they have no worries or calculations. Their minds are truly as pure as blank paper. No color can stain their firm and clean hearts. When they make a fuss, it's to develop their childish nature, to naturally stretch their muscles and bones. If the world of mankind could always remain in its childhood, I think a more peaceful and tranquil society could certainly be realized.</p>
<p>Time flows like water. The golden age of childhood has actually slipped away in the history of my life. When I see those little angels jumping around so lively, a feeling of envy arises from the bottom of my heart. Ten years from now, they will be like us, walking the path of adulthood. At that time, this momentary joy will only be enough to provide endless memories for the future.</p>

<p>— Luo Fang</p>
<p>The afterglow of the setting sun gradually ceases to ripple,</p>
<p>The sky changes from azure to ashen gray;</p>
<p>A cool evening breeze gently flows into my empty chest,</p>
<p>I vaguely feel a sense of loss,</p>
<p>Carrying a restless heart, I wander aimlessly down the street,</p>
<p>Gazing at the shadows of the plane trees slowly moving on the wall,</p>
<p>Gradually dimming and disappearing.</p>
<p>The fragrance of wheat and broad beans floats in the air,</p>
<p>A small patch of mud in front of the courtyard releases the breath of spring;</p>
<p>I breathe deeply,</p>
<p>Feeling an unbearable thirst,</p>
<p>Carrying a leaden heart, I wander aimlessly down the street,</p>
<p>Gazing at wild geese flying across the ashen gray sky,</p>
<p>Gradually becoming smaller and disappearing.</p>
<p>A thin layer of mist covers the surroundings,</p>
<p>All scenery, blurred, loses its vitality,</p>
<p>The streets are filled with noise and coal smoke;</p>
<p>I hold down the beating in my heart, listening carefully</p>
<p>To the long, drawn-out whistle of a distant train,</p>
<p>The muscles in my limbs tremble slightly,</p>
<p>Vaguely imagining from the South Sea and the Northern Lands,</p>
<p>A seed of hope flying in.</p>
<p>I laugh wildly in front of everyone,</p>
<p>I weep towards the ashen gray sky;</p>
<p>But, fatigue permeates my whole body,</p>
<p>Loneliness is like a vast black curtain hanging before my eyes,</p>
<p>I can only wander aimlessly on the endless streets,</p>
<p>Praying to grasp something,</p>
<p>To stir up excitement and intoxication, in a moment</p>
<p>Forgetting the sorrow of my soul.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Mr. Juqing (11) <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Ke Ling</p>
<p>He deliberately watched Shen Qingzhong's every move. The moment he found a fault, he would immediately sink his gaunt face and shout a single word at Shen Qingzhong in a heavy voice:</p>
<p>"Come!"</p>
<p>Shen Qingzhong was just about to slip a paper ring onto the braid tie of a classmate who was copying a book nearby, when he suddenly heard the teacher's roar. He hastily retracted his hand, and turned around to be met by Mr. Juqing's pair of sunken and terribly wide eyes. He ran up to him, bewildered.</p>
<p>Mr. Juqing did not say a word. His right hand grabbed the thick "discipline ruler" on the table, his left hand grabbed Shen Qingzhong's small hand and pressed it against the corner of the table. He concentrated all of his pent-up anger and resentment onto the "discipline ruler" in his right hand. The whole classroom was silent, only the crisp sound of the bamboo piece hitting flesh could be heard –</p>
<p>Crack, crack, crack, crack…</p>
<p>More than a dozen times in a row, the small palm was already red. Mr. Juqing waved his hand, and Shen Qingzhong quickly returned to his seat, laid down on his desk, and burst into tears.</p>
<p>This crying gave Mr. Juqing a bone-deep satisfaction.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, this corporal punishment education had not yet achieved its intended effect. That evening, a tall woman with a square face came, introduced herself as Shen Qingzhong's mother, and said to Mr. Juqing with a somewhat cold expression:</p>
<p>"Our Qingzhong is still young. Studying is just a matter for the study room. This child is also born thin and frail. At home, we rarely even raise our voices to him; so I hope that the teacher will not beat him like this in the future. Now the child's hand is swollen like a crab shell."</p>
<p>Toward this woman who completely lacked etiquette, Mr. Juqing was almost about to jump up in anger; but for some reason, he had no courage at all. He stood there dumbfounded for a long time, unable to think of even a suitable reply. It was Mr. Juqing's wife who squinted her eyes and said many kind words from the side, before this woman finally left in a leisurely manner.</p>
<p>Because of this small disturbance, Mr. Juqing's bright mood turned gloomy again. Moreover, he had a more profound feeling of "the decline of the teaching profession."</p>
<p>Because of this, he was depressed for several days again.</p>
<p>Not long after, just as Mr. Juqing's troubles had somewhat subsided, rumors spread like wind and brought new worries. An unexpected storm stirred on the calm lake.</p>
<p>This was a change that was even more impossible to deal with and more difficult to cope with than the "student conduct" issue. It was said that the district elementary school had learned that the private tutors were taking advantage of their turmoil to fish in troubled waters and pull in students from the school. Now they had decided on a way to deal with it and were going to take revenge.</p>
<p>Therefore, carrying a heavy heart, he heard all sorts of different news morning and evening.</p>
<p>One piece of news said that the district elementary school had already submitted an official letter to the county, and the education bureau would soon send personnel to the countryside to ban private schools.</p>

<h3 id="e207">Finance: Central Bank Aggressively Sells Shillings, Bullion's Upward Momentum Weak, Exchange Rate Improves by One and a Half Yuan <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>The gold market remained indecisive yesterday, with unstable sentiment. Although there was a rebound in the middle, the upward trend was only temporary. The Central Bank and the Bank of China aggressively sold foreign exchange, stirring up selling pressure. Despite the negative news, there was still a downward trend. Sassoon covered short positions, ultimately stabilizing the market. In the early morning, the overseas silver market rose slightly in both the UK and the US. The Montreal forward silver market rose slightly, and exchange rates all contracted. London spot gold rose by ten pence. Reports indicated that the Ministry of Finance had drafted a three-article outline on unifying the right to issue banknotes under the Central Bank, which slightly moved market sentiment. Preparatory trading opened in the off-exchange market, immediately rising to 67.8 yuan. Although there was supply, the Central Bank's listed exchange rates revealed that the British rate was flat and the US rate contracted. The customs gold unit rose by one fen, and the bullion standard price rose to 905.3 yuan, and then to over 9 yuan.

The exchange market should have been consistent, but after rising, it gradually retreated to within 70 yuan. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) listed its exchange rates, with the British rate flat and the US rate contracting by 0.0625.

Later, a negative news report from the Associated Press indicated that the Bank of China was aggressively selling, and the internal shilling market turned strong.

Later, the Bank of China again sold shillings, and sellers were active from both sides, causing a brief setback.

The second report for Indian silver showed a small movement and a slight increase in anna, and the market stabilized again. Later, the Chinese merchants' sentiment improved slightly, and the bull market gradually tightened and gradually rebounded. Later, the Central Bank appeared to be buying shillings, stirring up buying pressure, once approaching the 70 yuan mark. Unexpectedly, Reuters reported on Song Ziwen's remarks to reporters, such as that his position as President of the Bank of China was unrelated to politics, and that the government had no intention of inflating the currency, which was mostly as expected. However, the buying pressure was inevitably dampened, and those who wanted to sell poured out, causing a decline. Finally, the market leveled out. The market was mediocre throughout the day, and although sentiment rebounded, the buying pressure was still difficult to strengthen, and the trend was unpredictable. The daily market situation is recorded below.</p>

<h3 id="e210">Securities: Sharp Rise and Swift Decline of the '96 Public Bonds, Resulting in a Small Loss of Five Cents to Two Dimes; Most Other Bonds Rise More Than They Fall <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, trading at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was quite active. The '96 bonds rose sharply and rapidly, followed by a sudden reaction, entirely driven by market sentiment. This type of public bond, in the past, had never escaped the pattern of bullish speculators rushing to sell after a sharp rise. Repeated rumors, nothing more than air, were exploited by most for speculation. After the surge, everyone rushed to sell, causing the market price to plummet, as if following a set course. Observing the trading floor, there is likely to be at least one more exciting round ahead. Most other bonds remained firm, with the "Regular Six" being the most favorable. Throughout the session, all bonds showed solid gains, with minimal fluctuations, maintaining a slow upward trend. However, the '96 bonds, due to a sharp increase of one dollar and twenty-five cents this month at the opening bell, triggered a rush of bullish traders and eager sellers. The rapid rise was followed by a swift decline, as past experiences have shown this collective market sentiment to be unavoidable. As a result, forward market prices inverted. Subsequently, due to general reckless buying, many bullish traders continuously liquidated their positions, weakening market prices across the board. By the afternoon close, prices stabilized, but were down five cents to two dimes compared to the previous day. Other bonds mostly rose more than they fell, making a sharp decline difficult to sustain in the short term. The total transaction volume reached 16.8 million yuan, with the '96 bonds accounting for 7.655 million yuan. The resulting gains and losses are compared in the table below (unit: yuan; transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>According to the report from Sin Fung Yang Hong yesterday (8th), the New York stock market experienced mixed and slightly lower results. This was due to the sluggish performance of railway stocks and disappointment among traders regarding the Supreme Court's delayed ruling on the railway pension case. However, there was no real pressure in the market, so most stocks rebounded at the close. The utility stock market remained relatively stable, and the bond market rose slightly. Stocks on the small exchange also showed mixed results. The total daily trading volume was 710,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York indices are listed below:</p>
<p>Date	April 6th	April 8th	Change</p>

<h3 id="e212">Cotton Yarn: Amidst Decreasing Spot Inventory, Mark Yarn Potentially Rises, but Foreign Firms' Short Positions Remain Unmoved <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>The money market was firm in the morning and stable in the afternoon, and the situation became quieter. However, most opinions are still not pessimistic about Mark Yarn for the time being, because the spot yarn inventory has decreased, and the spot goods root of each factory is tighter. In addition, a certain gentleman is firm and does not let go of the multi-head quota, which should have a hope of rising. However, foreign firms are short, and they have remained unmoved, and the market has been greatly suppressed by them.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Market Situation is Stable</p>
<p>At the opening of the Mark Yarn pre-market, all months rose uniformly, and the situation was still tight. Because in the two days of holiday, the sales of spot yarn were still good, and the high-quality yarn spot goods of the Shenxin Factory were out of stock, so the market image was even better. A certain long still bought slightly, and all months rose by five or six dimes. However, after the second and third rounds of shooting, the same fell by a few dimes again. The tabletop in the field was dull, and it was heard that spot yarn transactions were less than the previous day. As a result, each month rose by two, three, and six dimes compared with the closing price of the previous day. The market situation turned softer at the afternoon opening. The chips in the field suddenly became loose and indiscriminate. Because of the floating profit settlement, the gold market fell slightly and was tired. However, overseas cotton industry news still rose, and the third-grade yarn rose by two or three yuan, so by the close, it returned a few dimes again. As a result, the near-month price fell by two or three dimes compared with the morning closing price, and the rest of the months remained unchanged. It was found that 550 packages were sold by Changyu, 600 packages by Shenji, 300 packages by Renfeng, 500 packages by Shengyuan, 700 packages by Gu Da, 400 packages by Taichang, 400 packages by Gongfeng, and 400 packages by Deji. 550 packages were bought by Jifeng, 800 packages by Yu Da, 1,400 packages by Hengchang, 350 packages by Yongda, 400 packages by Ruid Da, and 450 packages by Shenji. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices in one day are as follows:</p>
<p>Mark Yarn	Highest Price	Lowest Price	Closing Price	Rise and Fall	Inventory Number</p>
<p>April	183.2	182.9	182.9	Up 0.40	38,650</p>
<p>May	182.3	181.4	181.6	Down 0.10	45,100</p>

<p>Total	221,400</p>
<p>More than 1,000 Packages Sold in Actual Sales</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still good. It was found that a total of 1,068 packages were bought by various gangs throughout the day, and the price rose by five dimes. The purchase amount of each gang is as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong 535	Sichuan 120	Changsha 65	Henan 50	Same Place 120</p>
<p>Jiangxi 50	Luzhou 15	North Gang 5	Shantou 30	Ningbo 31</p>
<p>Nanjing 5	Same Trade 60	Fujian 5</p>
<p>Changing-Period Cotton Has Air of Squeeze</p>
<p>The cotton market is calm, but during these two days of spring closing, the US and Indian cotton markets were both good, and the market price should have an upward trend. In fact, the cotton stored by various parties is congested, the demand from the gangs is not strong, and the exchange rate is lengthened, and the people's minds are drawn flat. However, this month is particularly firm, and there is a appearance of squeeze. However, the time is still early.</p>
<p>Customs Mark Rose in the Morning and Fell in the Afternoon</p>
<p>At the opening of the Customs Mark pre-market, each month showed a prosperous image. It was because US cotton had a performance increase of 15 pounds of sound, the new cotton's rising momentum was doubly strong, and Indian cotton also rose by two rupees. It was found that during these two days of closing, the spot price of US cotton rose by 20 pounds of sound, and the market price of Customs Mark should have a rising power of several corners. Therefore, the head-round situation was still lively, and each month rose by two corners to one corner and a half. After the second and third rounds of shooting, it was heard that the gold price was ordinary, the forward price reached 5 yuan, and there were new shorts throwing down, so the market atmosphere brought looseness. However, the longs this month have squeeze air, spread to the market. As a result, the near month rose by one or two corners, and the far month rose by five or ten cents. The market suddenly became tired at the afternoon opening, and Tongji paid the financial community again to throw out additional codes and setbacks. However, overseas cotton market news was still good, the Indian cotton dark market rose by one rupee and seventy-five cents, and the price of three-grade cotton rose by seventy-eight cents to one yuan and two corners. However, Shanghai's people's minds were ordinary. The real reason was that the cotton stored was too thick and the pressure was greater. As a result, this month rose by five cents compared with the morning closing price, the far month was flat, and the middle month fell by one corner. It was found that Run Kang sold 3,000 dan, Changfeng 1,100 dan, Tongji 3,100 dan, Hexing 1,600 dan, Gengfeng 4,800 dan, Changyu 2,000 dan, Shenji 1,200 dan, Xiesheng 2,000 dan, and Xinting 1,100 dan. Yuan Da bought 1,500 dan, Da Fu 1,400 dan, Yu Da 2,100 dan, Yichang 2,000 dan, Run Kang 2,100 dan, Yikang 4,600 dan, Yuanxingchang 3,200 dan, and Yifeng 2,600 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices in one day are listed below:</p>

<p>Yesterday, at the opening of US cotton, due to the firm and sound stock market and killing types, co-workers, foreign firms, and local gangs bought together, and each month rose by two to six pounds of sound. Afterwards, it was slightly softer with other markets. There were not many sellers, and co-workers were still waiting for developments in Washington. Spot traders were very keen on the needs of the near month, and brokers bought the far month. During the middle, it returned due to long liquidation. However, the spot was firm, and it was rumored that Russia would purchase spot cotton in New Orleans, and the short holders activity compensated, which caused the market price to rise sharply. The close was very firm, and it was calculated that the spot rose by ten pounds of sound, and rose by eight points. Indian cotton initially fell due to long liquidation, and then rose due to speculative buying. Finally, it closed again due to long liquidation. It was calculated that Pingle rose by 0.25 rupees, Omar rose by 1.5 to 1.75 rupees, and Bai Luo Creek rose by 2 to 2.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded left, (8th electricity)</p>

<p>The flour market reported rising prices in the morning, but fell back in the afternoon. In the morning, the rain and the reported rising price of foreign wheat triggered a scramble for stockpiling and covering positions. Near and far months both rose by about one cent. In the afternoon, the weather cleared up, and the longs immediately returned to sell. Both Shanghai factories and inland trade factories sold, and the market immediately fell sharply. However, the Beiyang solid lock has actual flour paid for and loaded, and there are far months dragging in. In addition, the factory side throws out chips, and it is not seen much. Outsiders are still mostly optimistic, so the downward trend is still slow. As a result, the market price of this month is five mills higher, May is unchanged, June and July are five mills lower, August is seven and a half mills lower, and September is two and a half mills lower.</p>
<p>Wheat reported a rise of 30 to 40 cents yesterday, and the wheat market sentiment was very good. After the market opened in the morning, all months near and far stepped up by two or three cents uniformly. The market's sentiment was originally upward, and it was also affected by the rising price of foreign wheat and the cloudy weather. The market purchases were very prosperous, the sellers waited and watched, and the market stepped up. However, in the afternoon, the weather turned sunny, and inland factories and vendors had sold out. In addition, the flour market rose, the longs liquidated, and the market saw changes. As a result, this month is still up by one cent, July and August are down by two or three cents, and September's initial opening price in the morning was 3 yuan 64 cents, and the closing price in the afternoon was small, and the closing price was 3 yuan 60 cents. Present wheat opened Shandong Lei River Hunan various wheat 2,000 packages, the price was 3 yuan 82 cents, 3 yuan 72 cents, and the second was 3 yuan 68 cents, by Fuxin Fufeng Lijin.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's guest gang source was similar to the previous one, with a total of more than 20 numbers (nearly 4,000 stone of goods). The sales field in this street moved slightly, but the package stomach was slack, and only more than 200 packages were sold. Although the overall situation was tightening, it was still not very lively. Other various thick japonica and thin indica only rose back by one or one and a half dimes. The weather changed, and the supply and demand were similar, and the market price did not rise or fall much.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Recently, the weather has been cloudy and humid for several days in a row. More than ten boats have arrived from various river roads. The shops on the market are sparse, and the sales of each goods are flat. The market price of white japonica has tightened slightly, the arrival of thin indica is slightly strong, and the sales turn dull. The price is short four or five cents, and the white yuan is still soft. The rest of the goods are stable.</p>

<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market conditions, both the local and the guest sales were active. Yesterday, the Beiyang gang tried to handle small twisted rice, and the Nanjing gang and the Yangtze River area were active again. The local streets and the mainland were greedy. The domestic and foreign telegrams were all stepped up in various producing areas. Stockpile sellers and traders insisted on not selling, so high and secondary grades all rose by one dime uniformly. The city opened 15,000 packages of western purchases, and more than 4,000 packages of small twisted Siam and other broken rice were sold. Yesterday, the local mainland Nanjing gangs competed for guest indica, so the market stepped up a few cents, and the city also opened about 3,000 packages, it is said.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the soybean market seemed to be rising steadily. The reason was that the Guangdong gang did not eat much, and the people were afraid that the price was high and the stomach was dull. The cargo owners had to make concessions and sell them off. Under the stable and settled market atmosphere, more Shantou gangs were interested in the way out. The rest were oil factories, the local streets, and places. So yesterday's transaction was still not weak. It was estimated that 140,000 to 150,000 were opened of Fanjiatun beans and Sipingjie beans, one car of Yingzhou beans, more than 1,200 packages of Guide holding, two cars of Quanhe beans, one car of Zhengyangguan beans, 600 packages of Luohe beans, 300 packages of Shashi beans, 200 packages of Hankou Zha beans, 500 packages of Hankou Chi beans, and 100 packages of Hangou beans (please refer to the market price column for the above market prices).</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market, the trend was quite firm because Guan gold was tight and Dutch exchange rate was shrinking. The guild divided the disk, Guangdong coarse white was 17 yuan, 56 cents, and a small amount of transactions, slightly rising by six cents. Due to the poor quality of Taikoo sugar, B mark had returned to 18 yuan. No. 1 Zhenyu of this factory's cotton white was still 17 yuan, unchanged, and No. 2, 3, and 4 were returned as usual. In the number disk, the Chao gang opened up to pay for Zhuang Qing at 10 yuan and 9 cents, Huanggang Qing at 10 yuan, 54 cents, and Huilai Qing at 9 yuan, 87.5 cents, with a total of 300 packages being transacted, rising by a corner.

<p>Yesterday's hardware transactions were still very quiet, which was affected by the rain. However, the sales of 90-pound British tinplate were exceptionally lively yesterday. According to the investigation, the reason was that both the tea gang and the export gang had collected it, and the canning factory and the lard factory also started to add it. Therefore, the goods in the market were almost exhausted, and the price was rising steadily. The estimated price is 14 yuan and 25 cents, but for credit sales, it will not be sold for less than 14 yuan and 50 cents. It was heard that more than 600 boxes were opened in the market yesterday, and those who wanted to continue to collect them were still very enthusiastic. The sales of other 100-200 pound and Yankee goods were not as prosperous as the 90-pound ones, but there were still many buyers collecting them, so the situation was also very good.</p>

<p>— (Yang Xieli)</p>
<p>Passivity, inaction, fear of trouble, clearly declining but always interpreting it as "detached"; recklessly rushing, stirring up waves without wind, clearly being unruly but always thinking of it as "striving hard." Alas! What value is there in such "detachment" and "struggle"!</p>
<p>The more effort one puts into doing things, the more likely one is to encounter bad luck; because the more effort one puts in, the greater the responsibility one bears, and effort does not necessarily lead to success. Once there is failure, the blame will be severe.</p>
<p>Most women hope to be men in their next life, and some men also hope to be women in their next life. Is it better to be a man? Or is it better to be a woman? Because no one has lived a life as both a man and a woman, no one can answer. (It's a pity that Yao Jinping, who transitioned from female to male, is a fake; otherwise, he could tell us.)</p>
<h3 id="e224">Illegitimate Child <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>It was a warm spring morning, with a gentle breeze carrying the sounds of a newborn baby's cries. The cries were so powerful and full of rhythm.</p>
<p>Outside the door, there was a commotion of voices, all talking about an abandoned illegitimate child left under the overpass in the alley. Sure enough, under the overpass, on a pile of straw, lay a small child, wrapped in pink velvet and tied with a floral ribbon. His hands and feet were powerfully extending and contracting, as if preparing to fight in this world. Tears welled up in the corners of his eyes, and his mouth opened in constant "wah wah" cries, as if lamenting the misfortune of his life, the misfortune of being an abandoned illegitimate child.</p>
<p>A large crowd had gathered to watch, some in surprise, some in sighs, some in daze, and some laughing with their mouths wide open. But although there were so many people watching! And the child was crying with such vigor, yet not one had the courage to even touch him, as if the child were bringing impurity into this world. Those watching the spectacle were all gossiping about which family's scandalous daughter had engaged in such shameless behavior, resulting in this... nuisance.</p>
<p>Finally, an old Buddhist woman squeezed out from the crowd. She chanted Buddha's name and picked up the child. Upon unwrapping him, she discovered that he was indeed a baby boy, still stained with unwashed blood. Tucked in front of his chest were two five-yuan bills and a letter begging someone to raise him.</p>
<p>The old woman chanted Buddha's name a few times, tucked the bills into her pocket, hired a rickshaw, and sent the illegitimate child to the orphanage.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Hotel <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>Stepping into a hotel is a rare event for me. If I calculate it, I probably don't go more than three or four times a year, right?</p>
<p>It was probably in the middle of last month! I agreed to meet a friend and stepped into a small hotel in the front street of the ×× Temple in S City. The time was around 7:00 PM, just when the lanterns in S City's Chinese area were brightly lit.</p>
<p>There were a total of four or five people in our group. We chose a relatively quiet table to sit down at. Naturally, the waiters were very attentive in serving us! We ordered some wine and a few dishes, and then we started drinking heartily. At that moment, I personally felt that all of life's pain and sorrow could only be relieved by drinking. No wonder most poets and writers are happy to be close to this stuff.</p>
<p>While eating, we talked about everything from national affairs to social trivia, and from social trivia to personal anecdotes. Everyone spoke frankly and without restraint. I really wondered if there was any hypocrisy or pretense in the world? I thought to myself, understandingly.</p>
<p>The thing that made me most dissatisfied in the hotel was the noise of the drinkers. Some were talking loudly and expressing their frustrations at not being recognized for their talent. Others were drinking silently, seemingly using alcohol to drown their sorrows. The waiters were running around serving the drinkers, looking very busy. I observed everything in the hotel and realized that this was a small society, a small world. Look: the noise and clamor in the hotel brings together the attitudes displayed by all kinds of people and classes in society. Isn't this a microcosm of society?</p>
<p>"Alas. I didn't expect this small hotel to be a place for studying social problems," I thought silently as I returned.</p>

<p>Mr. Xie Xiaxun of Pingyang, an expert in Chinese chess, has been in Shanghai since the first year of the Republic of China, dedicating himself solely to promoting chess and developing this national skill. Xie's efforts are largely responsible for the popularity of chess throughout the country. It is now heard that Mr. Zhang Zhaolan, chairman of the Singapore Overseas Chinese Chess Association, previously telegraphed an invitation to Xie to go abroad to serve as a judge and advisor for the competition in Singapore. The China Travel Service in Shanghai was also contacted to extend an invitation. It is reported that Xie has agreed to go and is scheduled to depart on the 10th of this month aboard the Italian mail ship "Conte Verde". The following is a poem by Xie on his departure:</p>
<p>Feeling the ravages of a hundred battles on my land,</p>
<p>Sadness fills me as I bid farewell to friends on the Shanghai journey.</p>
<p>The grass grows and the orioles fly, spring is passing,</p>
<p>The household tradition is known to all, the path is not meandering.</p>
<p>War chariots cover the sun in the endless game,</p>
<p>Soldiers and horses soar to the clouds in a magnificent plan.</p>
<p>To continue the five-part new history of chess,</p>
<p>Ten thousand miles to Hainan, I strive forward like a black steed.</p>

<p>Chapter Eleven: Nightly Conversations of a Sad Life, Dreams of Footprints Scattered in the Wind and Rain, Too Much Deception</p>
<p>Zhiqian was stunned upon hearing these words. He thought to himself that he always wanted to save this poor girl. But no matter how he ran around, she could never escape the grasp of these demons. Matchmaking, but for whom? He pondered this, hesitating for several minutes, but when he came to his senses, the tea server who had spoken was already far away. Zhiqian regretted not asking the tea server more clearly who wanted this girl. He pondered for a while, and then two gusts of wind blew in, bringing the rain directly into the doorway. The dampness on his face made him shiver, and he had no choice but to return to his room. Behind his room was a window that faced the backyard. He was paying attention to the matchmaking for Huanhua, so he paced back and forth in the room, constantly looking out the back window. After about half an hour, Hu Xiaojiao arrived with an umbrella and a smile on his face. Judging by the situation, there was some hope of success in the matchmaking. He should have gone out to stop her and ask what was going on. But then he thought about how he had introduced a maid for Zhu Yueying yesterday, and the matter had not been settled, so people might be suspicious. He paced, thinking it over. But by the time he had finished thinking it over, Sister Hu had already gone to Jia Duocai's place. Not long after, Sister Hu returned. The wind was blowing hard, and she could not hold the umbrella steady. She kept the umbrella half-closed, holding it over her head, and quickly walked towards the back door. The wind was strong, so the rain was naturally slanting, wetting a lot of her clothes. However, she did not mind and walked away calmly. (178)</p>

<p>This practice, as it appears to us modern people, seems to be a kind of cheating; but the Empress Dowager at that time did not consider it offensive, but felt that this was an indispensable step, so wherever she went to inspect, she saw nothing but unreal and false situations.</p>
<p>The shoe-making artisans also occupied another courtyard. This courtyard was located below a flat area, with a low terrain and many houses. Generally, there was a main hall and two side halls. During the day, they worked in the main hall, and at night, they lived in the side halls. While they were working, the two leading old maids were constantly watching over them, correcting them immediately if they drew or embroidered incorrectly. Therefore, their four eyes were always fixed on the hands of the eight girls, their eyes always following the needle and thread in their hands, not daring to relax at all. This is what I saw when I accompanied the Empress Dowager to inspect. I don't know if it was still so serious after we left? (289)</p>

<p>— Pan Zhaogan</p>
<p>The spring rain fell continuously, making the weather extremely cold. The dim and gloomy sky was filled with countless gray-black rain clouds. Fine rain fell in slanting lines, wetting a dry dirt road.</p>
<p>"Sir, Madam, save, save a poor child like me!"</p>
<p>The sound came closer and closer. After a few minutes, a small child with a dark face and a hungry expression stumbled through the wind and rain.</p>
<p>"Old man, alms, alms!" At this time, the child had walked from the rain to the entrance of the Wang family's house and was pleading with the gatekeeper, trembling slightly.</p>
<p>"Get out of here! Who cares about your business so early in the morning." As he spoke, his face turned fierce.</p>
<p>"Old man, I haven't eaten for three days! Have some compassion, please give me some alms!"</p>
<p>"Who told you not to eat for three days? You hateful beggar, are you not leaving?" The old man's voice was stern, showing that he was angry.</p>
<p>The child knew that he would not get any money, so he had to leave. But a group of dogs behind him rushed up, roaring and running, almost catching the child. The child was knocked down on a muddy road, and the dogs sniffed around him for a while, singing a song of victory and returning.</p>
<p>When he woke up, his clothes were soaked through with rain, his stomach was extremely hungry, and it hurt very badly. Pointless sobbing only increased his hunger. When he stood up, he felt completely weak. An old woman came back from the market carrying a vegetable basket.</p>
<p>"Old woman, save me!" the child pleaded vaguely.</p>
<p>"Poor child, why are you walking in the rain? Go and sit at the entrance of the Wang family's house over there for a while!" The old woman was very compassionate and walked forward with the child's hand.</p>
<p>"Old woman, I... I won't go over there... there are scary... dogs over there!"</p>
<p>"Poor child, then go to my house! How old are you?"</p>
<p>"Old woman, eleven years old."</p>
<p>As he spoke, he reached the entrance of the old woman's house. The child was afraid and did not dare to go in.</p>
<p>"It's okay, come in!" the old woman said kindly. The child followed her in, and she told him to stand outside. She went in and brought out a bowl of cold rice, giving it to the child to eat.</p>
<p>The child quickly finished the rice, his eyes wide and staring blankly.</p>
<p>"Child, do you have parents?"</p>
<p>"Old woman, my father died long ago. Last year, my mother sold me to the city, to a place called the Quanwang Temple..." The child stopped abruptly when he said this, and a boundless terror appeared on his face again.</p>
<p>"Poor child, speak freely, it doesn't matter now! Why did you become like this?"</p>
<p>"Old woman, I... I..."</p>
<p>"Tell me! What does it matter?"</p>
<p>"Old woman, you must never tell anyone! Because I was beaten and starved every day in the temple, I ran away. Look, my hands and feet are all injured."</p>
<p>"Is this true? Then you can't live here, because people from the Dawang Temple often come to our house!"</p>
<p>"Ah!" The child started to cry when he heard this. "Old woman, what can I do!"</p>
<p>"There's no way. You try to imagine our kind of family, how can we bear such a big disaster! You should go to the east street, there is an old lady there, she is very kind and might take you in!" The old woman said to the child with great compassion.</p>
<p>The wind blew harder and harder, and the rain fell harder and harder. In the wind and rain, the old woman watched the child's staggering back as he walked away.</p>

<h3 id="e232">The Barbaric Actions of Civilized People <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— An</p>
<p>Recently, another case of an American sailor beating a Chinese person to death has occurred in this city. From a humanitarian point of view, this is an extremely unfair matter. It has often been heard that foreigners beat Chinese people without cause within Chinese territory. It is not known why this particular incident happened again. However, now that someone has been beaten to death again, it is only natural for the Chinese people to express their dissatisfaction. It is hoped that this will not be seen as some kind of anti-foreign action.</p>
<p>As one of the Chinese people, I cannot help but be stirred with some emotion when our unfortunate compatriot is brutally killed by an American sailor. However, my indignation does not exaggerate and accuse this as the behavior of foreign imperialist countries bullying the Chinese nation. I am dissatisfied with those who always claim to be civilized people and like to call others barbarians! If others are barbarians, then they are undoubtedly civilized. Here, I want to ask: Is beating people for no reason civilized or barbaric? If the answer is civilized, then the meaning of civilization is a bit vague. If it is barbaric, then this kind of barbaric action is often performed by civilized people. From this point of view, civilized people who are used to calling others barbarians are themselves barbaric.</p>
<p>Is wantonly committing violence the reason why civilized people are civilized?</p>
<h3 id="e233">Companions in Picking Cloddy Rice Roots <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Feng</p>
<p>At that time, my family was neither rich nor truly poor; it wasn't as if they were waiting for me to gather grass to burn for cooking, but it also couldn't be said that it was purely for recreation. Partly due to my mother's encouragement, and partly due to my own curiosity, I carried a manure basket and a small grass hoe, and joined the large group of children to pick cloddy rice roots.</p>
<p>It was October.</p>
<p>The large sun, as if covered with dust, had lost its power from the summer days, revealing a gray-red face, quietly watching the ground. The wind in the open fields, because there was nothing to block it, could rush and ram, and seemed even more vigorous. The sky was gray-yellow, the ground was gray-yellow, the tree branches were gray-yellow, and the houses were gray-yellow.</p>
<p>But we weren't sentimental; how could innocent children know these things? We only felt that it was fun to play like this. The wind was our opponent in a race, and perhaps we thought that because our opponent was strong, it made us seem even more heroic?</p>
<p>Those children were all rough children; they were the children of poor farmers, they had grown up struggling through hardship, which could be seen from their ugly but sturdy faces. They hadn't been to school, they didn't understand manners; they used cursing instead of greetings, and fighting instead of affection. Sometimes they fought until they cried, sometimes they fought until their heads were broken and bloody, but they didn't care, it would be fine after a while, and they would still be together. In their group, the only one with a bit of refinement was me, because I was still a child who hadn't left the study yet. They didn't envy me; in their minds, they hadn't yet been instilled with the poisonous "all occupations are lowly, only studying is high". They just looked at me with strange eyes. Perhaps they were wondering:</p>
<p>"Why doesn't this kid curse? Why doesn't he like to fight?"</p>
<p>Although in my own opinion, I felt much wilder than the other children of my station.</p>
<p>We were like a swarm of bees, rushing to the harvested rice root fields. The broken-off root hairs, like a many-fingered hand, tightly grasped the dirt, and the place where they were grasped was taller than other places. We cleverly used grass money to knock on it, first knocking off the large chunks of dirt, then picking it up, scraping it a few more times on the money teeth, throwing away the loose dirt stuck on it, and then putting it in the manure basket, before going to find the second mineral head clod.</p>
<p>Everyone worked hard, fatigue, we can't say there wasn't any, but we forgot. We even competed to see who could pick the most.</p>
<p>Like this, we could pick two manure baskets every day, one in the morning</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>once, and once in the afternoon. When I laboriously carried the manure basket full of cloddy rice roots home, my mother would always greet me with a smile and take the manure basket. Sometimes, if my father was nearby, she would proudly boast:</p>
<p>"My son is gradually becoming useful."</p>
<p>So I was happy, I felt that I had received more than ordinary reward. But what encouraged me to pick cloddy rice roots wasn't just my mother's praise. Because I firmly believed that if I had to do such heavy and laborious work alone at home, I would get tired before I picked two, and no matter what my mother said, I would run away. However, in the open fields with the angry wind howling, in the open fields with the gray sand covering the sky, sometimes with water streaming from my eyes, and sometimes with snot hanging down, I was excited to work. This can't be said to not be because of those small, rough companions.</p>
<p>They were all interesting people, seeing innocence in vulgar curses, and showing nature in vicious fights, with no insidious plots, no cunning tricks, no forced smiles with tears, and no joyful false cries. People like this, today, are like gold in the sand, very difficult to find.</p>
<p>Now, we are far away from each other, the memory's negative is gradually fading in color; and the past events of childhood, only the vague shadows remain. What kind of life are they living? Apart from my imagination: skeleton-like farmers, fierce-looking bandits, beggars wandering the streets, and starving corpses rolling in the ditches?</p>
<p>Yes, what kind of good life can they still live? Since age can take away our innocence, won't fate also deprive us of our happiness?</p>
<h3 id="e234">Beside the Xiangzi Bridge <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Fu</p>
<p>"Those days living beside the Xiangzi Bridge can never be forgotten!"</p>
<p>Suddenly drifting back to the traces of the secluded Xiangzi Bridge, I can't help but murmur these thoughts in a daze. However, what can never be forgotten will also be forever impossible to see again. The past beside the Xiangzi Bridge, where have you gone? ...</p>
<p>The more I feel that the days beside the Xiangzi Bridge were extraordinarily beautiful, the more it evokes painful memories, those dreamlike beautiful days that have disappeared and cannot be recovered!</p>
<p>It seems that my numb heart and brain are still under the Han River flowing under the Xiangzi Bridge, impacting the wall under the bridge, and the gurgling splashes are playing an idle and ethereal melody; distant and hazy, the smoky past gently surges up beside the leisurely Xiangzi Bridge...</p>
<p>That was from the age of fourteen, when I was studying at the foot of Han Mountain. I often walked along the secluded embankment, disappearing into the depths of my beautiful and quiet hometown; and from the overlapping mountains, I quietly floated out to the side of the Evil Stream, stepping on the poetic sandy beach, and approached the ferry. The light boat slowly swayed, and looking towards the distance, I crossed under the verdant Jinshan, the clear and broad mood was like water and like a dream, this was an innocent and beautiful heart that had never been beaten by wind and rain! Peeking south from the low awning of the ferry, often at the time when the setting sun was infinitely good, the slanting sun sprinkled on the water surface, like strands fluttering with the ripples of the turquoise crossing, yearning to watch. Unintentionally listening to the clear sound of the ferryman moving the pole, echoing the low sound of the water, all the worries of the world are forgotten. The boat slowly moves forward, as if connecting to the pontoon bridge under Jinshan, one boat after another, piling up and meandering, lined up across the river, and fearfully spreading far to the Jiangbian at the foot of Han Mountain. This is the Xiangzi Bridge! In the rushing Han River, dozens of large stone docks pulled from the Linjiang of Dongmen end, arranged in a straight line, floating pointlessly, spread out to the Han Mountain on the opposite bank across the river, The piers are full of shops, and the bridge is filled with many ancestral halls, all selling snacks and Lingnan's special fruits. There are also countless tourists and travelers scattered around. It is said that this beautiful Han Bridge was built by Han Xiangzi, the immortalized nephew of Wengong.</p>
<p>Our school buildings are located between the foot of Han Mountain and the Xiangzi Bridge, some are on the mountain, relying on the pure and quiet Han Mountain, overlooking the wonderful and lovely Xiangzi Bridge in the clear Han River flowing around the city, studying leisurely as if in a dream, wandering at the foot of the mountain, strolling on the bridge and beside the bridge, what longing days! Quiet and drunk, sitting in the dormitory, the door facing the cool Lingnan wind, floating gently. Silent and infatuated, leaning against the cool pavilion pillar of the campus outside the dormitory window, silently watching the flowers and listening to the songs of cicadas, holding a painting, a young man's mood is a beautiful dreamlike scene! When the weather gets hotter, take a bath in the gurgling mountain pits to your heart's content, listen to the birds singing, listen to the low melody of nature, or leap into the Han River to swim. The spring breeze blows warm, strolling on the secluded mountain, as if sleeping sweetly. When night comes, the moonlight leaks like silver through the seams of the leaves, and shadows scatter under the trees. Or drag to the Xiangzi Bridge, climb the bridge and look around, as if watching a wonderful painting, poetic and lush. Three or five friends, not smiling at each other, chanting poems in a low voice, shouting boldly, breaking through the beautiful night, draped in thin clothes, dragging wooden clogs, leaning against the bridge railing to listen to the sound of water, chewing lychees, and chewing cage rounds. Looking back at Han Mountain, the secluded and lofty school buildings shrouded in silver mist are smiling quietly. Walk down to the sand boat in the middle of the river and watch the countless lights of the boatmen twinkling, and the clear and leisurely songs of the Hakka women on the boat. The turquoise waves beside the sand boat are slightly wrinkled, and I am still unwilling to go home late at night!</p>
<p>However, where are the scenery beside the Xiangzi Bridge? How can anyone not be saddened by the memory of this beautiful dream of the past few years of life rolling in blood? What is there to chase after the old dream! There is nothing to chase after, the Xiangzi Bridge may be dilapidated today, but there, my soul is deeply imprinted!</p>

<h3 id="e236">Discussion on Early vs. Late Marriage <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>——A General Response to Readers——</p>
<p>Recently, the editor has received many letters from readers, all inquiring about and discussing the issue of early versus late marriage. Some advocate late marriage, saying that early marriage has many harms; others advocate early marriage, also presenting many examples. However, they are somewhat doubtful about their own views and dare not say definitively that they are correct. Therefore, they write to propose their views and discuss them with us, requesting a clear indication.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of early versus late marriage, I believe it is very important. Now, I will briefly describe my views below as a general response, and I will no longer reply to individual letters. I hope readers who inquire about this issue will pay attention.</p>
<p>The perpetual maintenance of human life relies on the reproduction of the two sexes, and marriage is the means to achieve reproduction. Therefore, marriage is not only a personal issue but also an important task in human development. If we do not study all aspects of marriage and blindly marry, the consequences will affect the future of humanity.</p>
<p>Under the old ethics, marriage only focused on false and impractical etiquette. As for the physical development of the two sexes and whether the age of marriage was appropriate, little consideration was given. Generally, parents, influenced by the ancient saying "When a son is grown, he should marry; when a daughter is grown, she should be wed," and wanting to experience the joy of having grandchildren, quickly arranged their children's marriages to fulfill a lifelong wish. As a result, many people encountered adverse outcomes due to marrying too early.</p>
<p>When a person reaches around fourteen years old, although it can be as early as twelve or as late as seventeen, special changes occur in the body. This change is a symbol of sexual maturity, medically called the "onset of puberty." During this period of puberty, both the body and mind of the two sexes undergo special changes. In particular, they feel the need for sex, and the previously vague distinction between the two sexes becomes clearly recognized.</p>
<p>Since the need for sex begins at the onset of puberty, the earliness or lateness of puberty is, of course, greatly related to the age of marriage. Therefore, the age of marriage in various countries is determined based on the earliness or lateness of puberty. Generally, people in temperate zones experience puberty earlier, and early marriage is more common; people in cold zones experience puberty later, and early marriage is less common.</p>
<p>Many people advocate holding marriages at the beginning of puberty. Their reasons are:</p>
<p>(1) Sexual desire is a human instinct. Marrying when one knows the need for sex is unlikely to cause any harm.</p>
<p>(2) Early marriage can eliminate harmful masturbation and nocturnal emission.</p>
<p>(3) Early marriage can prevent immoral behavior and avoid the danger of venereal disease transmission.</p>
<p>These reasons do have considerable merit and cannot be absolutely denied. However, we should know that although sexual development is mature during puberty, the development of other parts of the body is not yet complete. If marriage is based solely on sexual maturity, regardless of other circumstances, it will inevitably have the following consequences:</p>
<p>(1) It will affect the health and development of the body.</p>
<p>(2) The children born will be physically unsound due to congenital deficiencies, affecting the development of the race.</p>
<p>(3) Underage men and women have weak wills and are often unable to restrain excessive sexual desire.</p>
<p>(4) They are too young and lack sufficient knowledge to serve as role models for their children.</p>
<p>Early marriage not only has these drawbacks, but even from an economic and intellectual point of view, marrying too early will never yield good results. While we oppose early marriage, we also do not advocate marrying too late, as each has equivalent harms. Based on various circumstances, we believe that the best age for men to marry is twenty-five or twenty-six, and for women, twenty-one or twenty-two. As for masturbation and venereal disease, they are indeed harmful and undesirable behaviors, but they can be remedied through "sex education." Under the old ethics, parents believed that discussing sexual desire with others, especially their children, was a dirty and despicable act. This view is, in fact, wrong. Many scholars in foreign countries advocate that children aged ten to thirteen should be taught simple knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the reproductive organs; around the ages of thirteen to sixteen, they should be told about the harms of masturbation and the dangers of venereal disease. As for all seductive books, lewd pictures, and obscene plays, they should be strictly prohibited from children. At the same time, efforts should be made to arouse children's interest in studying and vigorously promote children's sports, so that the elements that constitute sexual energy are consumed in the pursuit of learning and physical exercise. Allowing sexual instinct to be naturally restrained is indeed a good method.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, education in our country is not yet widespread, and there are too many stubborn parents. Who can break the false ethics and promote sex education?</p>

<p>Wang Bingmei's Donglai Bo Yi</p>
<p>Huaxing (1260) 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM</p>
<p>Marquis Min of Jin and Quwo</p>
<p>The distinction between嫡 (dí, of the main wife's lineage) and 庶 (shù, of a concubine's lineage), and between elder and younger, is what Heaven has created, not what humans have done. The sages established fixed rules. Those who have a state should pass it on to the eldest son of the main wife. Those who are sons of concubines should all know that their position comes from Heaven, not from humans. Since the beginning of civilization, everyone has followed this rule and dared not change it. It is not only because they fear the sages, but also because they fear Heaven. Therefore, Wei Zi dared not replace Zhou, Mu Yi dared not replace Duke Xiang, Zi Xi dared not replace King Zhao, and Ji Zha dared not replace Zhufan. With the virtue of these wise men, if they had inherited the throne, they could have expanded the achievements of their predecessors and laid a foundation for endless prosperity. However, they hesitated and declined. Is it not because they could not bear to sacrifice the interests of millions of generations for the sake of one person's private desires and create a disaster of endless strife? The distinction between嫡 (dí, of the main wife's lineage) and 庶 (shù, of a concubine's lineage), and between elder and younger, is what ancient and modern sages dared not lightly change. Who was Marquis Min of Jin? He dared to be the first to create chaos. Drowning in private love, he recklessly made light or heavy distinctions when naming his sons, leading to the disaster of Quwo and ultimately destroying the state. Yet the Zhou kings favored him.</p>

<h3 id="e241">Ziegfeld’s Idea of Ugly Became Stars in the Film Industry (Part 2) <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Ni</p>
<p>As for facial features, Ziegfeld's so-called beauty is even more different from the currently popular Hollywood beauty. There may be some actresses there whose two eyes are exactly the distance of another eye, or whose pupils are exactly the same distance from the tip of their nose to their eyebrows -- these are a few points of the beauty standard, but who cares so much about it. Hollywood beauty cannot be measured by regular circles and squares.</p>
<p>Constance Bennett is considered beautiful in Hollywood, but her square chin and small nose not only do not meet Ziegfeld's standards, but also may not be considered beautiful by ordinary people, but she is considered a beauty on the screen. Take Joan Crawford, her pair of large nostrils are completely out of proportion to the rest of her nose, and her forehead is completely masculine, but she is still a beauty on the screen.</p>
<p>Many other actresses have special defects in their faces. Like Ruth Chatterton, her mouth is obviously large and useless. Anne Harding's face has two halves that are different from each other. Clara Bow's face is concave on the top and convex on the bottom. In terms of expression, the beautiful Norma Shearer's face is half indifferent and half enthusiastic. Jean Harlow's nose has an abnormal angle.</p>
<p>In short, most of the beauties in Hollywood, such as Fay Wray, Gloria Swanson, Helen Hayes, Winne Gibson, Nancy Carroll, Ruth Chatterton, Lupe Velez, Dolores del Rio, Claudette Colbert, and Katharine Hepburn, etc., would be considered failures according to Ziegfeld's standards.</p>
<p>Breaking Ziegfeld's standards and being able to become stars in the film industry is not limited to the above-mentioned actors who have long been famous. Even Mona Loa, who has recently become very popular, does not meet Ziegfeld's standards. Her appearance is completely boyish, and she is full of freckles, and she is not a good-looking boy, but no one can say that she is ugly. As for the other newcomers, such as Elizabeth Begner from England, and the child stars who have risen, such as Qin Muya, Jean Parker, Josephine Hutchinson, etc., almost none of them meet Ziegfeld's standards.</p>
<p>It is true that very few of the current Hollywood actresses meet the standard of Ziegfeld's beauty, but on the other hand, if the chorus girls under Ziegfeld were put in Hollywood, I am afraid that none of them would have any hope of success. This is not only because of the changes of the times and different perspectives, but also because what the naked eye calls beauty may not look good in front of the camera. Darryl Zanuck, the head of United Artists, once said: "Since the prevalence of sound films, no actress has been able to become a star solely on the beauty of her face. The beauty of the face in the photography field is only worth eight dollars a day; but the brain can be worth one hundred dollars a day; if the face and the brain are combined, then it can be worth one thousand dollars a day!"</p>
<p>A beautiful mind... this is the Hollywood way. Therefore, a Ziegfeld beauty must have exceptional intelligence to hope to become famous in Hollywood. Maureen O'Sullivan is a very prominent example. Others, such as Ruby Keeler, Jean Blondell, and Noel Francis, have also been members of Ziegfeld's beauty team, but they all feel that jumping from the song and dance world to the film world is no longer a shortcut to success, and a beautiful face is no longer the password to Hollywood.

<h3 id="e242">Exploration of Film Education and Film Bookification <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Bo Ning</p>
<p>On Wednesday evening, the school showed educational films. The night self-study class was stopped, but the fruit stalls at the gate were still surrounded by a large group of students. In the dark self-study room, someone was pulling a Jinghu, brightening his throat to sing "Wujiapo." I wondered, "They don't want to pay to see a show, what is the reason?" I grabbed a younger classmate and asked him. He curled his lips and disdainfully said, "Who wants to see it? They always show things like papermaking, fishing, and planting pearls. You'll get tired of watching it half the time." So, a "?" was immediately added to my mind.</p>
<p>I think the reason why movies can attract such a large audience is because their interests are multifaceted. They are based on various human instincts to create various plots. Humans have the instinct for "sex," so there are a large number of love movies. Humans have the instinct for "fighting," so there are many war movies. Humans are "curious," so a whole batch of detective movies appear. Humans like to "seek knowledge," so many animal movies and various news movies are born. In short, humans have several instincts, and movies have several natures. They are constantly changing and adjusting, so the general audience also enjoys them and never gets tired of watching them.</p>
<p>Now, educational films extract a part of the movie and only focus on the aspect of human pursuit of knowledge. The materials they take are either history or geography, either production undertakings or pioneering undertakings, and they do not consider that human instincts are multifaceted. Therefore, although the intention is good, it is a pity that it is too rigid, too unvaried, and does not fit the psychology of the audience, so it becomes a moving textbook, and it is no wonder that young people shake their heads when they see it.</p>
<p>In fact, if we want to achieve the effect of film education, we must not abandon the current advantages of film, and we should make full use of them. We still need love movies, detective movies, and war movies, which are closely in line with people's instincts. However, when making them, we should take into account the educational value in terms of material selection, structure, and performance, so that the mission of film education will not be difficult to complete. If we insist on extracting a part of the movie and calling it "educational movie," then in a few days there will be "industrial movie," "commercial movie," and "agricultural movie," and the result will be one moving textbook after another.</p>

<p>The Yihua Company is serious about the "scenery" in the film, and is unwilling to be perfunctory, which has already been proven by facts. "Escape" cost tens of thousands of gold, and went to Mongolia, Suiyuan, and Chahar to take real location shots. In "Woman," more than 5,000 yuan was spent to build a building, which was then burned down... These are all sacrifices that other companies are unwilling to make. Now, the sound film "The Beginning of Man," directed by Mr. Shi Shushan, also has very magnificent scenery, and the scenery of Suzhou streets, small rivers, wharves, etc., that was shot in the past two days is even more magnificent, because these sceneries were all taken by the scenery artist Mr. Fang Peilin in Suzhou in advance with a camera, and the scenery built upon returning was built according to everything in the photos. For example, the boats in Suzhou are different from those in Shanghai, so two boats were specially rented from Suzhou and moved to the Suzhou River excavated by the company. Although many people think that Yihua's sacrifice is "stupid," in fact, only such "stupid work" can obtain beautiful results. Hollywood film companies mostly do such "stupid work" for scenery, so Yihua Company has the style of Hollywood.</p>

<p>"Tears of the Remnant" is the first work of Zhaohua Film Company in 1935. This film captures the reality of social unemployment as a novel theme, boldly depicting the dark side of society. In today's society, with extreme turmoil and serious unemployment problems, "Tears of the Remnant" gives young people a very bright and pure indication!</p>
<p>Here, a new child star - Yu Ni - was discovered. Her innocent, lively, cute, and natural performance is arousing inner resonance!</p>
<p>In the day when film companies are urgently feeling the need to cultivate new talents and create child stars, Zhaohua Company's move is especially worthy of our deep attention! (Que)</p>

<p>— Tongyun</p>
<p>After James Bolton walked away, Dennis Bader took Sharon's hand and said, "Don't be angry that I came out with them. Julia insisted on dragging me along. I couldn't embarrass her too much. But their constant bickering is unbearable, and I can't spend too much time with them. I'm afraid it will interfere with the most important thing in the world to me..." His voice lowered as he trailed off. At that moment, Julia came chasing after them. She said to Sharon, "Ha, Sharon, why don't you come sit with us? Come on... you and I... have a lot in common... for example, we can both talk about Tommy..." Sharon said softly, "Julia, I think you should go back. Henry is coming." Julia had no choice but to return dejectedly. As she left, she turned back and called out, "Tommy, come back soon."</p>
<p>As soon as Julia left, Dennis Bader said to Sharon, "Let's not sit here. Let's get a motorboat and go play at my place." Sharon immediately agreed. So they went out together. By the time James finished his phone call and returned, Sharon was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Soon, Dennis Bader had taken Sharon to his villa. It was a very exquisite stone house built on a hillside on the north shore. Behind it was a small mountain with extremely serene scenery. There was also a boathouse by the water, connected to the outer waterway. Many nosy people often speculated about how Tommy Dennis Bader had gotten this house and how he maintained it. He was originally completely penniless, but since the bank collapsed, he was even worse off than before, completely broke. They arrived there and went inside. Sharon took off her coat. Dennis Bader took Sharon's coat and lowered his head to kiss her fragrant shoulder. He lit the kerosene lamp and sat with Sharon on a low sofa. He held her hand tightly and said softly, "My heart, I don't know how much love it can hold." Sharon patted his hand, not saying a word, but her eyes were full of amorous feelings, as if she couldn't contain herself. After a while, she said, "Tommy, I always think you should stay away from the Patterson's. She's simply crazy about you. Of course, it's very difficult for you. If you weren't such a gentleman, you probably would have ignored her long ago..." Suddenly, there was the sound of a motor on the river outside. Dennis Bader's ears were sharp, and he heard it, but Sharon was lying on the sofa, her eyes half-open and half-closed, very comfortable, and she didn't hear it. Dennis Bader stood up and said, "I'll go get some wood. Let's make a fire to keep warm." His expression looked very flustered, but Sharon didn't see it. She just turned slightly and said, "No need to make a fire. It's too late, we'll be leaving soon." Dennis Bader deliberately acted coquettishly and said, "Let's make a small fire, as a souvenir. When I see the fire here alone in the future, I will think of tonight."</p>
<p>As he spoke, he went out to get wood. Before he left, he put a record on the gramophone, and the room was immediately filled with music. It turned out that Dennis Bader went outside and a motorboat docked in front of his house. Sure enough, as he had expected, the person in the boat was Julia Patterson. Julia jumped ashore and said fiercely to Dennis Bader, "I know Sharon Trot is here. I want to reason with her, and tell her what you are to me. I really can't take it anymore." Dennis Bader blocked her path and grabbed her clothes, which were made of thin silk, and immediately tore. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e247">Psychological Requirements for Car Drivers <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Bo Ning</p>
<p>Cars. Many people give it the terrible nickname "City Tiger". Because every day. Every week. Every month. Car accident cases are continuously discovered. People who lose their lives under cars continue to increase. No wonder ordinary people fear them.</p>
<p>However. The car itself is improving day by day. Transportation facilities are also being actively improved. What is the remaining problem? It is people. It is the selection of drivers. From a psychological point of view. Drivers must at least avoid the following negative shortcomings.</p>
<p>(1) He is not colorblind. People who are colorblind. Often cannot distinguish various colors. Even the mildest red-green colorblindness. They also cannot distinguish red and green. We know that the signals currently used in traffic. Are mostly red and green lights. If a driver cannot distinguish red and green. Will he rush around and be able to follow traffic rules? Distinguishing whether a person is colorblind or red-green colorblind is very simple. Just use several colors to let him distinguish them.</p>
<p>(2) He does not have astigmatism. People with astigmatism. Their eyes are often easily tired. Vision can never be focused. And hallucinations often occur in front of them. If a driver. His vision cannot be focused. He often has hallucinations in front of him. Isn't that a very dangerous thing. If you want to test whether a person has astigmatism. It is very easy. Just give him a picture with lines to test it. If he can clearly see the lines next to him. He does not have astigmatism. If he looks at it and some lines are clear. Some lines are blurred. Then he is unreliable.</p>
<p>(3) He does not have motor incoordination. People with motor incoordination. Often cannot control their own movements. Usually his movements are normal. Sometimes suddenly his hands and feet will be confused and disordered. Imagine a person driving a car. Driving on a busy street. Suddenly there is motor incoordination. That is dangerous enough. To test whether a person has motor incoordination. It is also very easy. Just blindfold his eyes. Call him to stand with his two toes together. If he stands very steadily. Then there is no problem. If his body cannot support him. And seems to be about to fall. Then he is unreliable.</p>
<p>(4) He does not suffer from automatic reactions. People who suffer from automatic reactions. Can be said to be the most dangerous. If he is driving a car on the road. He sees another car. Driving very fast. He will chase after it involuntarily. Many car accidents are due to this aspect. It is difficult to check people with this kind of problem. Only observe his daily behavior. See if he is quiet and steady. Because people with this disease. Mostly cannot sit quietly for an hour or two.</p>
<p>The above four psychological defects. The obstruction to drivers is very serious. People who have not learned to drive. Should first measure whether they have such shortcomings. To avoid learning in vain, and those who have already learned. Should also measure themselves. If you find such defects. Would rather give up this career. So as not to waste energy. But have bad consequences. As for the municipal authorities that examine car drivers. And those who employ drivers. They should pay more attention to the above four conditions.</p>

<h3 id="e256">Statistics of Car Sales by American Manufacturers and Top Ten Cars in 1934 <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— Shadow</p>
<p>—Ford First, Chevrolet Second—</p>
<p>What was the business situation of American automobile factories in 1934? Regarding the statistics of total car sales for the whole year, we have not yet received a confirmed report. However, the sales statistics of each factory from January to September 1934, for the nine months, have already been published. Moreover, during these nine months, the increase or decrease in the sales records of each factory has largely determined the situation for the whole year. Therefore, we will first translate the confirmed number of new car registrations of each factory in the United States during these nine months to inform the readers of this publication.</p>
<h2>Page 28</h2>
<p>Before we talk about the total number of cars sold by each factory in the nine months, we should first mention the car sales records of each factory in September. In September, American automobile factories in Detroit produced a total of 146,931 cars, which is 7% lower than in September 1933, and 24.2% lower than in August of the same year. However, in terms of the total number of cars sold in the nine months, a total of 1,564,690 cars were sold, which is still an increase of 29.9% compared to the same nine-month period in 1933.</p>
<p>In September, Chevrolet surpassed Ford in the number of cars sold and won the first place, with a difference of about 1,000 cars. The total number of Chevrolets was 43,003, accounting for 29.3% of the total, while Ford had 41,929 cars, accounting for 28.5% of the total. Third place was Plymouth, with a total of 24,551 cars. According to the statistics from the new car registration offices in various provinces, Chevrolet ranked first in 32 states across the United States, while Ford ranked first in 16 states. In Colombia, Ford also took the lead, while Plymouth ranked third in all provinces, but in Colombia, it surpassed Chevrolet to take second place, exceeding Chevrolet by 36 cars, and was also very close to Ford. These three leading vehicles accounted for 74.5% of the number of registrations in various places in September, which was slightly higher in August. Individually speaking, the order of the top ten cars did not change in September compared to August.</p>
<p>Oldsmobile had 1,500 more cars than Dodge and won fourth place. Pontiac surpassed Buick by 131 cars and took sixth place. Studebaker was 100 cars less than Studebaker, ranking ninth, while Chrysler originally ranked tenth. Although the total number of Oldsmobiles ranked fourth, Dodge ranked fourth in as many as 21 states in terms of provincial distribution, while Oldsmobile only had 19 states. In addition, Pontiac also competed with it, accounting for fourth place in two states. Others, such as Buick accounting for four states and Studebaker accounting for one state, all won fourth place.</p>
<p>In terms of the total number for the nine months of 1934, Ford still ranked first, with registrations increasing by 211,579 cars compared to 1933, which was the same as the general expectations of the automotive industry beforehand. The three low-priced cars, Ford, Chevrolet, and Plymouth, had the strongest sales. Chevrolet's registrations increased by 39,449 cars compared to the previous year, and Plymouth by 61,923 cars. The total increase for the three companies was 312,923 cars compared to the previous year. In terms of percentage statistics, some vehicles increased even more than the above three. For example, Hudson's registrations for nine months totaled 15,851 cars, while in the same period in 1933, it was only 2,534 cars, an increase of 525.5%. Studebaker increased by 11.8%. The combined number of Nash and Lafayette increased by 119% compared to Nash alone last year. Although Lafayette was a new vehicle last year, its registrations in September were also as high as twelfth. Others, such as Studebaker, increased by 165% in nine months compared to last year, Oldsmobile increased by 96%, LaSalle increased by 38.1%, Cadillac increased by 18.4%, Graham increased by 27%, Buick increased by 27.4%, Ford's percentage increased by 89.1%, Chevrolet by 10%, and Plymouth by 32.1%.</p>

<p>— (New News Agency)</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Commends the Chengdu-Chongqing Road Project, Guo Shu-gao Assists Tang Shi-zun's Planning</p>
<p>Chongqing Communication. Liu Xiang, Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government, has been working hard on road construction in recent years. However, due to the geographical conditions of the province, the road construction work has been quite difficult, especially in the Laoyingyan section. Fortunately, Tang Shizun, the Director-General of the Sichuan Provincial Highway Bureau, upholds Chairman Liu's intentions and embodies Chairman Chiang's spirit of hard work. He has supervised his subordinates and is determined to proceed. Moreover, Guo Shufu, the former special envoy of the road, has assisted Tang with all his strength, which is quite remarkable. This time, Chairman Chiang visited to give instructions on the suppression of bandits and showed concern for road administration. He personally inspected the Laoyingyan section of the Chengdu-Chongqing Road and saw that the project was huge and the design was well-considered. He praised it as the top project among the national highways. Director-General Tang is a great construction talent and deeply admired Tang's spirit of taking on important responsibilities. In addition to first sending Director He to announce the commendation, he also immediately sent a telegram of praise to commend him. In addition, the completion of the five major highways of Sichuan-Hankou, Sichuan-Guizhou, Sichuan-Gansu, Sichuan-Shaanxi, and Sichuan-Hubei is truly urgent. Therefore, he specially telegraphed the Sichuan Provincial Government, the two road bureaus, and the relevant provinces to expedite the construction so that they can be completed as soon as possible. In terms of funding, Chiang has agreed to first subsidize 1.2 million yuan from the central government to start construction in order to ease the burden on the people of Sichuan.</p>
