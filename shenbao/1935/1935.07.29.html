<h3 id="c14">日本擴張軍備之影響 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>日本軍事當局在其國防第一主義之口號下。致力於超越財政限度之擴張軍備計畫。國家財源因以枯竭。預算赤字無可彌補。政府方面乃有不得不濫發公債之勢。髙橋藏相以公債數額。已過飽和之點設再增發。足陷國家於破產。日昨發表聲明。痛陳利害。含有警告軍部之意味。日本輿論多予贊助。而民政黨尤對高橋主張。力加擁護。足證擴張軍備之影響國。本卽在日本一般國民。亦已有深切認識矣。</p>
<p>日本近年過度擴張其軍備。所藉口老。無非爲應付國際危機計耳。然此想像中之危機。一加分析。卽可知其全爲日本本身逾越正義範圍之東亞政策所形成者。蓋日本獨占東亞。排除列强勢力之雄心。昭然若揭。利害攸關之各國。勢不得不在太平洋方面。作防衛之準備。此卽日本軍事當局引爲擴張軍備之口實。以求國民諒解者也。</p>
<p>太平洋方面列强對日。卽有具體政策。亦僅以防衛爲其目的。此在研究國際情勢者。殆所深悉。蘇聯高唱世界和平。對日且已作種種事實上之讓步。英國則應付其本國屬地及歐洲糾紛。尙威棘手。對於遠東。顯有鞭長莫及之戚。卽以日本爲唯一心理上敵人之美國。亦因深受不景氣之打擊。痛威國際戰爭損害之慘重。在差可忍耐之情勢下。决不願挑動日本惡感。此在羅斯福總統當政之近年。尤爲明顯。自日本退出國聯以後。美國對於日本在華積極行動。迄未提出任何外交抗議。今年五月間。美國爲太平洋海軍會操。且派親善專使二。批赴日修好。今者羅斯福又申言其睦鄰政策。可知美國對日。未始不委曲求全。近據外電所傳。美國準備放棄華府條約中之不設防條欵。在阿留申羣島關島。及其他太平洋屬島設防。此雖似有剌戟日本之意朱。然其性質。固僅以防衛自國領十爲限也。</p>
<p>就上以觀。可知太平洋危機之能否避免。其關鍵全在日本。設日本鑒於國際軍備競爭之有害無益。就其旣定之東亞政策。爲合理的修正。使其不遭忌於列强。則太平洋方面之和平。卽無破壞之可能性。此亦當爲日本一般國民所明瞭者。然而日本軍人現正醉心於過去日俄中日兩役之勝利。憧憬於獨覇東亞之美夢。望其爲國際和平而放棄傳統政策。豈不憂憂乎其難哉。</p>

<p>（東京）高橋藏相曾以塡償歲收、倘繼續增發赤字公債而漫無限制、則將來當遺下重大禍根、於是再度對於公債發出聲明、但陸軍當局對此表明不滿之意、以爲財政當局以公債消化超過限度恐招財政之危機爲口實、而將緊急不可或缺之軍備充實附諸等閑置國防缺陷於不顧、此種辦法斷難承認、蓋必要之軍費乃爲國家百年之國防鞏固計、决仍極力要求、目下正由關係事務當局熱心計算整理之中、而除滿洲事件費之標準預算。資財整備費·航空預算·及其他經常臨時各項明年度預算槪數、當於八月一日以前向陸相提出、林陸相則俟橋本次官返東京後、召集預算省議、加以詳細檢討、在陸軍方面仍决定要求必須之最少限度並交還大藏省、聞其要求預算額大約可達六億六七千萬圓云、（廿八日日聯）</p>

<p>（東京）陸軍對於大擴充陸軍航空陣、經種種研究結果、决定新編航空部、故將在八月一日命令定期異動之前、公佈該軍令、共內容如下、</p>
<p>（一）新設飛行團、若在戰事時發揮航空之最大能力、應與陸海軍航空部隊編成獨立大空軍、近時各國空軍之編成亦由斯意味、故聯合數飛行聯隊、編成飛行團、成爲作戰單位、方爲達該理想之階叚、因此八月一日在各務原新設第一飛行團、明年度並將在朝鮮台灣新設該團、（二）新設髙射砲聯隊、（三）增設飛行學校、（四）改組航空本部、將航空本部向來之四部制改爲三部制、另設航空廠爲技術方面之監察機關、本廠設東京、並在立用·各務原·朝鮮·及台灣設四分廠、（二十八日電通電）</p>

<p>經濟專刊路商合作建設鐵路倉庫之芻議  （吳紹會）　　－　引言　　鐵路所負流通商貿，開發地方之責任，不僅在於貨物之運輸；對於貨物之保管，亦不容漠視。前會闡述二十年五月，鐵道部電飭各路添建貨物倉庫意旨，草擬『對於建設鐵路倉庫之商榷』一文（見本刊第九五期），將鐵路倉庫析為四類：　　（一）單純的運輸倉庫　由鐵路出資建置，自任管理。　　（二）混合的運輸與普通倉庫　由鐵路出資建置，自任管理。（以小規模者為限）　　（三）　分的運輸與普通倉庫　運輸倉庫部分，由鐵路出資建置，自任管理；普通倉庫部分，有下列四種解決方式：　　（甲）由鐵路出資建置，並由鐵路自任管理；　　（乙）由鐵路出資建置，而由商人租用經營；　　（丙）由商人出資建置，而由鐵路租用經營；　　（丁）由商人出資建置，並由商人自任管理。　　（四）單純的普通倉庫　規模務求宏大，設備務求新穎，由商人出資建置，並由商人自任管理。　　其中第三第四兩類之普遍倉庫，以由銀行合組銀團，集資興辦，而由鐵路供給貨運岔道等便利，雙方充分合作，比較易於實現。　　二　銀行界提出之具體意見　　上之建議，頗引起銀行界之注意與興趣，或通訊商議，或微取參考資料，綜其所提出之具體合作意見，大致如下：　　（一）由鐵路商請銀行組織銀團，合資興辦。　　（二）調製沿綫各站及附近物產統計，供銀團參考研究。　　（三）倉庫構造依貨物門類而定，由鐵路繪鬧，與銀團，商定後呈部核定。　　（四）倉庫建築費用歸銀團擔任；所需地畝，由鐵路供給。雙方簽定契約，訂明若干年後所建倉庫悉歸鐵路所有，期前作為無條件租與銀團。　　（五）鐵路原有倉庫，亦由雙方訂約，無條件租與銀團其期限與前條相同。　　（六）銀團對於倉庫有經營權及管理權，鐵路有督率權。　　（七）倉庫之修理及一切經常費用，統歸銀團負擔。　　（八）倉庫收容貨物，遵照部定等級，分別保管，由銀團塡發棧單，以備貨主押欵之用。　　（九）堆存貨物，屬於運輸保管者，照鐵路向章辦理；屬於普通保管者，酌收保管費，價目由銀團酌擬，呈部核定施行，修改時亦同。　　（十）倉庫應設岔道，由鐵路無條件供給。　　（十一）倉庫如需要碾米，打包，裝箱，壓榨等附屬設備，槪由銀團擔任裝置；所需地畝，由鐵路供給。除設備外，如有建築之房屋，亦由雙方訂入契約，期滿歸鐵路所有。　　（十二）倉庫堆存之貨物，得向鐵路直接報運，鐵路應予以便利。　　（十三）倉庫堆存之貨物，在銀行辦有押欵者，如遇地方不靖等特殊情形時，鐵路應儘量供給車輛，代為運出，以保安全。　　（十四）倉庫及其他附屬房屋，至約期屆滿時，如雙方同意繼續辦理，由銀團按當時租價，擔任租金，繼續經營。　　（十五）銀行建築之倉庫及其他房屋，在約期未滿前，因特種情形，銀團不願繼續經營時，應按建築原價，以折舊方法，公估價值，由鐵路償還之。　　三　對於上項意見之商討　　上項具體方案，面面俱到，足為路商合作辦理鐵路倉庫之準繩；但有數點，不能不願意者，茲聲述如下：　　（一）調查沿綫各地物產一節，鐵路與銀團各有其經濟立塲，鐵路之所獲，或非銀團之所需；為避免盤柄計，似以雙方派員會同辦理為宜。　　（二）倉庫及其他房屋近需之基地，如鐵路本有路地，可資利用，自不妨供給，否則似只能由銀團進行收購；好在預擬此項倉庫之地點，不在都市範圍以內，地價較廉，所費有限。　　（三）關於微收普通保管費之價目，鐵路亦有其運輸上之關係，似以雙方會同擬定較為妥當。　　（四）鐵路對於運輸保管，包括在運輸責任範圍以內，當然應由鐵路自行辦理；故所謂『鐵路原有倉庫，亦由雙方訂約，無條件租與銀團』云云，恐與鐵路運輸之整個責任有碍。　　（五）銀行對於普通保管，旣係經營堆棧事業，且可辦理抵押借欵，實屬一種直接的業務，與鐵路所辦之運輸保管性質逈異，故可杸為兩事，不必混為一談；銀行所設普通保管倉庫，誠不妨作為一種永久的投資，無所謂租用，亦無須另有期滿歸還鐵路之規定。至所揭銀團因故不願繼續經營時，應由鐵路估價償還一點，不管謂經營此項倉庫，有利則進，無利則退，在銀團固進退有據，在鐵路則措置為難，似失公允之道；且凡百投資，無不含有幾許冒險性在內，銀團之經營倉庫，自亦不能獨居例外也。　　（四）路商合作建設本路倉庫具體辦法之擬議　基上論列，爰冉酌擬路商合作建設本路倉庫之具體辦法如下：　　（一）地點　就京滬路吳淞碼頭，麥根路，鎭江，丹陽，奔牛，滬杭甬路日　港，閘口，及其他相當地點，根據貨運實況，選定一處，先行試辦。　　（二）資金　由銀行聯合組織銀團，集資興建，並自任經營管理。　　（三）地基　選定倉庫地點，附近如有路地，由本路以最低租價租與銀團應用，以明產權；租期屆滿後，銀團有優先繼續租用之權。　　（四）設備　此項倉庫，以大規模興辦為原則，除堆藏貨物外，如冷藏，磨製，碾軋，壓榨，打包，各種設備，應根據需要情形，儘量建置；由鐵路代繪圖樣，會呈鐵道部核定辦理。　　（五）岔道　倉庫需用之岔道，由本路擔任建築及修養。　　（六）劃分保管　倉庫內部，除普通保管完全歸銀團辦理外，可另以一部分劃分為運輸保管，由銀團以最低租價租與本路使用。將來凡貨物存儲運輸保管部分，已滿規定期限者，可移置普通保管部分；其存儲普通保管部分之貨物，如需待車裝運者，亦可移入運輸保管部分。各依規定章則辦理。　　（七）會訂價目　普通保管倉庫收費價目，由雙方擬定，會呈鐵道部核准施行。　　（八）裝卸問題　貨物之裝卸，與經營倉庫有密切聯帶關係，故有同時　謀解決之必要。茲擬下列辦法：　　（一）儘量購置機械裝卸設備，如搬運機，吊物機，起重機等以期工作迅速。　　（二）裝卸工人屬於普通保管者，由銀團僱用，屬於運輸保管部份者，由鐵路僱用或招標承包，惟雙方各項待遇及工作情形，務求一致；由雙方會訂甄別辦法及管理規則，據以執行；以期造成其他各站裝卸工作之表率。　　（三）規定分班裝卸辦法，輪流工作，晝夜不停，以免貨物虛候與車輛延擱。　　五　結語　　按照以上所擬八項辦法辦理，其利有四：　　（一）在銀行為擴充堆棧事業，且與鐵路運輸聯成一氣，不患不能發展。　　（二）在鐵路為解決保管問題，不獨前述第三類第四類之倉庫可以實現，即第二類之倉庫，亦可連帶解決；客商感其便利，鐵路亦受其裨益。　　（三）此項倉庫雖管理上俏覺分歧，然在銀團為一氣呵成，在鐵路可免　床架屋只煩，經費上，手續上，均比較節省不少。　　（四）此項倉庫之裝卸工作，因與其他各處之裝卸事務絕無聯屬關係，則可施以特別之　練，置辦新穎之設備，創行適宜之制度，作為試驗，不受拘束。　　至於各地貨物之流通，客商金融之周轉，而使生產發展，工商振興，為我舉國上下所○夕祝望者，雖此項倉庫未必　能收此大效，當亦不失為一種助力。用敢　陳所見，供各界有志建設者共同研討，期臻完密；然後舉此　想付諸實現，豈惟鐵路之幸，工商各業亦利賴之。半年來上海現銀存底之動態  冷波　　自美國白銀政策實施後，世界銀價暴漲，我國白銀滾滾外流。在去年一年之中，僅以上海以埠而言，白銀出超竟達二萬三千一百餘萬元之钜。於是存底空虛，資金枯竭，遂造成吾國空前的金融恐慌！換言之，中國金融恐慌之造成，其直接的原因，就是存銀的缺乏。　　在去年大結束的前夕，其情形之危急，已達極點。洋拆明盤高至六角，暗盤尚不止此數，工商因週轉不靈而倒閉者，日有所聞。各界當局雖竭力設法解救，但終為事實所迫。苦無良策，最後只好將結束的期限展延到今年四月底，再圖根本解決之策。然而根本辦法始終無出，而轉瞬間『四底』之期已到，無法再延，於是所謂今年之四底恐慌便不能不爆發了。而六月中旬，又是端節關係，恐慌再度緊張，此次恐慌範圍不僅工商界在其籠罩之中，即金融界本身，亦受其撼搖。茲將半年來上海倒閉之銀行與錢莊列表如下：　　據上表，半年來上海銀錢業倒閉者竞有十五家之多，其倒閉的原因，固然有的是由於其內部組織的不健全或平日營業方針的不正當所致，但是它們倒閉的直接的。一致的。原因，還是周轉不靈』。年來內地資金集中上海，故百業凋敝，而上海金融界則獨　繁榮。可是現在這獨榮的金融界，也是為資金缺乏而感到周轉不靈，以至停業倒閉。由此亦可想見上海金融恐慌如何之嚴重矣！　　上海金融恐慌完全是由於存底枯窘所造成，已如上述。但是上海存底的枯窘，不僅造成上海金融的恐慌，同時對於中國國民經濟的復興的前途，亦發生重大的阻力。年來上海存底之所以異常豊富者，乃是因為內地不靖，農村破產，內地資金流入都市，這本是一種變態。現在匪亂肅清，內地漸趨平靖，故需大量資金，由都市流入內地，以從事建設。然而現在都市的資金已被海外吸盡，那末，將來復興國民經濟的工作，定感絕大的困難。　　上海存底，對於全國國民經濟，旣含有如此重大之意義，那末它這半年來變動的內容，實有作一分析探討的價值，籍此亦可稍供關心吾國金融者之參考。茲將本年上海各月存底數字與去年同期者列表如下：　　廿四年　廿三年　較去年減少　　一月　三一一、九五〇、〇〇〇元　五一〇、二三四、〇〇〇元　一九八、二八四、〇〇〇元　　二月　三一〇、八九八、〇〇〇元　五一一、九二九、〇〇〇元　三〇一、〇三一、〇〇〇元　　三月　三一二、三三二、〇〇〇元　四九九、五二三、二〇〇元　一八七、一九一、二〇〇元　　四月　三一五、二六〇，〇〇〇元　五〇三、五三三、二〇〇元　一九〇、三八七、二〇〇元　　五月　三一四、六八六、〇〇〇元　五一三、一三四、四〇〇元　一九八、四四八、四〇〇元　　六月　三一二、三〇六、〇〇〇元　五四四、三一四、〇〇〇元　二三二、〇一八、〇〇〇元　　由上表可知，今年上海現銀存底雖有增加之趨勢（六月份之存底較一月份者增加三十五萬餘元）但與去年同期相比較，則每月都減少一萬九千萬元上下，直與去年十二月底之三一六，八七〇，〇〇〇元相比較則减少四百五十餘萬元之多，這點是說明上海的存底，仍然未能恢復舊觀，換句話說，就是上海的金融，仍然未能脫離恐慌的範疇。或者有人以為當美國白銀政策正在加緊進行的期間，要想使上海白銀存底，在短期間內，完全恢復舊觀，當然是不可能的，能保持不再減少，也就難能可貴，況且還有增加呢？這種說法固然是很對的，但是我們要把今年存底增加的組成，和原因再加以分析！我們便會失望了，事實如何請看下表　　華商銀行　洋商銀行　總數　　一月　二七〇、七八四、〇〇〇元　四一、一六六、〇〇〇元　三一一、九五〇、〇〇〇元　　二月　二六〇、七四八、〇〇〇元　五〇、一五〇、〇〇〇元　三一〇、八九八、〇〇〇元　　三月　二六〇、三七〇、〇〇〇元　五一、九六二、〇〇〇元　三一二、三三二、〇〇〇元　　四月　二五八、三九八、〇〇〇元　五六、八六二、〇〇〇元　三一五、二六〇、〇〇〇元　　五月　二五九、六五〇、〇〇〇元　五五、〇三六、〇〇〇元　三一四、六八六、〇〇〇元　　六月　二五九、八三〇、〇〇〇元　五二、四七六、〇〇〇元　三一二、三〇六、〇〇〇元　　由上表可知今年上海銀底的增加，完全是由於洋商銀行存底的增加所造成。其六月底之存底，較一月者增一一，三一〇，〇〇〇元，而華商銀行存底不但毫無增加，反而减少，其六月底之存底，較一月者减少一〇，九五四，〇〇〇元。這點我們應該特別注意，我們知道洋商銀行存底的增加，對於中國的金融上不但無補，而且有害。因為洋商銀行存底的增加，是由於吸收中國的資金而來。而中國的資金一流到外國銀行的手裏，中國便失掉主權，即等於流到外國一樣。總之，今年上海現銀存底在華商銀行方面，是步步减少，在洋商銀行方面，却節節增加，這種現象，是與中國有害無利的。這點我們應該認清覺悟，而不要以為上海存底增加，便就樂觀起來；並且還應積極設法糾正這種不利的局勢。　　我們再來檢討一下洋商銀行存底增加的原因，這裏我們可以分二方面來看：（一）消極方面：洋商銀行的存底之所以增加的原因，是因為各洋商銀行的停運現銀出口。洋商銀行的停運現銀出口，並不是為顧及中國金融上的利益，乃是為維持其本身的安穩。自去年美國白銀政策實行後，世界銀價高漲，洋商銀行不顧中國的利害，便紛紛運銀出口，以謀厚利。於一年之間，運出現銀二萬一千七百餘萬元之多，共存底由去年一月份之二八三，〇五八，六〇〇元降至同年十二月六五，九八〇，〇〇〇元，共存底的枯竭，由此可想見矣。換言之，洋商銀行存底已達最低之限度。所以在去年年底以根基素固而操中國金融靈魂的某外商銀行，亦因銀底拮据，而糟擠兌，並且還改變其從來的帝國主義的尊嚴，『紆尊降貴』式的向華商銀行（中國交通）乞救。洋商銀行，經過這次的警告，便不能不起戒心，不敢再運銀出口，以免本身基礎之顚覆。（二）積極方面：洋商銀行存底的增加，是經過如下的三種方式：（一）提高存欵利息，以吸收中國的資金，至於其利息究竟提高多少，因其保守秘密，故無從探悉，大多數的中國人，崇拜洋人的心理仍然很深，再加以高利的引誘我們相信一定會有大量中國的資金流到洋商銀行的。（二）增發鈔票，以換取現金，據耿愛得先生之估計，洋商銀行今年二月份鈔票的發行，較去年同期者增加二，〇六〇，〇〇〇元，（關於此二點對於中國金融上，經濟上，的害處已有人發表過，故此處從略不贅，）（三）代收外國進口商人的貸欵，吾國每年在貿易上有大量之入超，以致每年皆有大量資金流入洋商銀行之手。　　洋商銀行現在正在加緊吸收中國的資金一方面又與中國在口頭上訂立所謂紳士協定（？）以矇蔽與緩和中國的人心，俾增加其吸收吾國資金之便利。因為該協定是說洋商銀行，自動的在『相當期間』內不再運銀出口，其實現在洋商銀行根本就無銀可運，故其所謂『相當期間』者，那是說它們尚無現銀可運的期間，並且不但籍此協定可以增加共吸收中國資金之便利？同時對於中國還是一個大大的人情，等到資金一旦吸足，那時『相當的期間』便過去了，仍可照樣運銀出口，以謀其利。此協定對洋商銀行是有百利而無一弊，對中國恐是無所得得，我們應當想法防制其陰謀，否則中國的資金將被其完全吸净，那時，吾國金融的前途更不堪救護了！（未完）商業新聞金融　星期拆息不動收解停頓　角幣微昂銅元轉縮　　昨為星期日、銀行照例放假一天、故金融形勢愈滯、市塲中洋拆、早午市均為二角、仍與前同、拆票交易、早市轉賬一百五十餘萬、新交易三十餘萬、午市交易未開、小總會中交易四十餘萬、洋押欵交易取　三十餘萬、錢莊洋公單收解二千八百餘萬、各路滙欵四十餘萬、鈔要交易、僅暗記參發出三十餘萬、客路來源　十萬、此外如收解等、以銀行休業、均在停頓中、至於輔幣市面、江南小洋、早市漲一元、開八百三十六元、午市續加一元、改為八百卅七元、故結果較前市大二元、做出交易、早市二千角、午市四千角、廣東小洋、早市漲一元二角、開七百三十四元八角、午市回落半元、改為七百卅四元三角、故結果較前失七角、做出交易、早市十六萬角、午市九萬五千角、銅元為三百四十二千五百文、較前縮短五百文、交易數額三萬二千五百三十七串五百文、合代價洋九千五百元、　　早市　午市　　洋拆　二角　二角　　江南　八百三十六元　八百三十七元　　廣東　七百三十四元八角　七百三十四元三角　　拆兌　一千三百六十角九分　一千三百六十一角八分　　銅元　三百四十二千五百文　同　　衣牌　三千四百二十五文　同　　角坯　二百五十　文　同　　貼水　九十一文　同證券　上週公債突然軋空　金短正六軋漲三元餘　　上週七月二十二日至二十七日、華商證券交易所、市况極為活躍、一則以七月份期貨、已屆最後之三四日、一則以環境消息、忽利於多頭、市價逐步上騰、殊出人意料之外、按自河北事變以後、國內水災之距、有侵及蘇北之勢、本埠金融之枯竭、津埠時起謠一只環境之不良、逐見放空者異常擁擠、前週市塲之流　、必將軋多、空方尤見　固、但上週形勢、突起變化、初傳金鎊欵漸有希望、　勢頓轉軋空、而一部份猶不願早補、致釀成最後一日、依然空頭掉期而軋空更形激烈、繼傳銀行紙幣準備、現金部份由六成减為四成、一轉移間、一方現金頓見充裕、一方債券需要增加、　面籌碼、頓見供不應求、債市之畸形發展、適在交割前後、故尤見激烈、自五十三號（大都代四十八號）多日來逐項收進、更使　面特別注意、共對於九六之需要、尤非一般人意料所及、預料前途、九月份上塲時、市價當尚有繼續趨漲之可能、上週經過、週一即有金鎊借欵之謠、北幫買進、七十八號補空、五十二號進九六、市價上漲一元許、週二忽因四號賣出而回鬆數角、金短係四號及五十三號賣出、故獨小九角之多、週三多方堅穩不動、空方漸起搖動、抵補漸忙、初因三十五號之出而疲、繼因五十四七十二及七十八號等之補空及掉期、市價疲而復興、結果尚漲数角、週四為本月份期貨最後一日、軋空形勢、最為熱烈、空方除忍痛抵補、及掉期外、繼無回旋餘地、空方之失敗、實因　般小資本家、鑑於金融界之不健全、現欵之移轉漸多、債券投資漸增、空方遭此意外打擊、規避之方、祗有掉期、以期最後之勝利、不料週五起、即有紙幣現金準備减低之說、市塲交易、適祗做八月份　個月、一般得風氣之先者、陸續吸收、市價竟直綫上騰、比漲一元至一元半不等、九六成本低小、尤易操縱、竟已達到十二元、綜計一週市價經過、計漲起熟角至三元有零、九六亦漲元半以上、全週成交總數、雖每日祗做兩盤交易、竟達　萬零二百八十九萬九千元之多、茲將其漲跌結果、比較列表於左、今日為七月份期貨交、割停市　灭、（單位元成交單位百元）美實業股漲勢最勁　　新　洋行報告、昨（二十七日）紐約股市上升、投機家預料汽車公用與鋼鐵等股尚將續漲、故此種股票之需要尤殷、債市堅靜、小交易所股票参差帶堅、半日成交七十三萬股、道　斯指數列左、紗花　美棉靜待今日借欵之發表　　昨美棉開盤、因利物浦消息不佳、外商賣出、各月跌三至六磅音、其後同業買進十月期、經紀商及本地幫亦從事買進、市價回升、惟成交不多、買方無特殊消息、市況趨軟、空方則以傳聞週一將發表一角二分借欵、不敢拋賣、最後因多頭了結、又復下降、計現貨未動、期貨跌一至十磅音、英棉現貨漲六點、期貨漲一至三點、印棉多頭了结、但少數　　出口商買進、計平果爾漲一羅比、奧姆辣漲一·五羅比、白羅溪漲二羅比、原電錄左、（二十七日電）　　平果爾　一三九·〇〇　漲一·〇〇　一九·三〇　　奧姆辣　一九三·七五　一·五〇　二七·〇〇　　白羅溪　二三〇　二五　二·〇〇　三一·九〇　　四五月期　二一五·七五　二·〇〇　二九·九〇　　又據孟買電、二十九日四五月期白羅溪花之開盤預測、為二百十七羅比、較上日收盤漲一·二五羅比、上月中旬　上海華日紗出口數量　　七月中旬棉紗出口量、日纱為三千八百五十九包、比上旬之四千八百四十九包、减少九百八十九包、華紗為一萬六千三百二十一包、比上旬之一萬一千二百十一包、增加五千一百十包、茲將出口數量及各地名列下、（單位包）　　日廠紗　　漢口　四九七　青島　四三九　蘭印　二八六　孟買　四三五　沙市　七八　長沙　九〇　其他　七五二　上旬　四、八四九　天津　六九三　香港　一四〇　大阪　二八六　蘭貢　一〇　蕪湖　八三　廈門　七〇　合計　三、八五九　　華廠紗　　廣東　三、七一七　汕頭　二、一七四　九江　一、一四七　重慶　八一四　沙市　一六　廈門　八九　合計　一六、三二一　香港　五、三九一　漢口　九〇八　蕪湖　六五一　長沙　一、二八七　宜昌　四一　青島　七六　上旬　一一、二一一糧食　河下米銷動回漲一二角　惟東新粳到多獨跌　　（滬南）昨日各幫來源仍到有十七八號、（貨共三千四五百石）、惟銷塲稍轉活絡、本街作客蒞市者頗多、因連朝價盤跌透、都出手採辦、而包胃亦續有青島烟台幫辦六七百包、故大局行勢頓見轉變、士氣上升、做開蘇同粳及南港早稻行情回起二角許、薄稻價見高一角不等、變兀平定、陰兀無市、東新則續以天晴、獨小二尺、　　常帮白粳　二二·七　常帮白元九·〇〇　平望白粳九·一五　　干巷早稻一〇·〇　同里特粳九·九〇　盛澤白粳九·　〇　　張澤晚稻一〇·一　又　市粳九·三〇　張澤早稻九·九〇　　青角真特一一·六　吳江白粳九·九〇　楓涇晚包九·八〇　　泗涇特包一一·一　北坼白粳九·四五　葉榭次稻九·一五　　五庫特包一〇·八　黎里白粳九·三五　青角飛粳一〇·一　　新昌東新一〇·二　蘆墟特粳九·五〇　松江特別一一·〇　　（滬北）昨日河下各路來源十六七號、市上去化白粳本街零拆續有、鄕胃亦有、價漲起二角左右、東新粳到有百數十石、銷路平常、價小二角、薄稻到銷兩和、市形定局、白元平疲、其餘各貨無甚上落、　　常帮白粳　　倪海和一一·九　毛仁成一一·五　永大廠一〇·三　　無錫白粳　　袁細寶一一·七　吳鳳高一一·四　毛榮記一一·三　　常州白粳　　金菊興一〇·九　金盤興一〇·九　　蘇州白粳　　同泰義一一·七　鄧長根一〇·三　　宜興白粳　　吳中春九·六　　青浦薄稻　　敘順德一一·八　朱恒豐　一一·七　　金壇白元　　周盤根　八·六　董奎樓　八·〇　尤重泉　八·八　董生福　七·一糖市　潮青將暫停運申　有辦理登記公賣之說　　昨據油頭電訊、潮青實行公賣、定於三十日起暫停出口、辦理登記、嗣後地價可歸劃一、可免過漲過跌之虞、但查現市已屬低盤、如是則後市當有轉企之可能、　　公會劃盤二四粗砂白現貨昨以十六元二角半成交、比升五分、轉口貨PT嘜四元八角、亦有劃出、本廠綿白一號十五元四角半、號盤有閩幫開出興化亦五百餘包、價為十元九角至八角、次七角半七角、比前好起二角、聞海南赤有五百餘包、亦在接洽中、或可成交、東白四號十六元五角四分、八號十六元四角、東赤好起一角、為十二元一角、洋糖存底有减無增　（七月二十七止）　　貨別　本屆量　比上屆　　粗砂白　九一、三八五　減　五、三四一　　又又小包　一九、九八五　無更動　　荷赤　八、七八六　減　五五二　　中砂白　九〇四　——　　古巴赤　一五、八七〇　減　二、九六八　　太車白　一一、二〇〇　減　四〇〇　　共計一四八、一三〇件</p>

<p>自由談一折書到鄉村  稜磨　　一折書的勢力，一直鑽到鄉村來了，雖然鄉下早已儘有人看報，而活版鉛字排印的書，並不缺少，曾有少數人看到過，但鉛字排印的書的成爲眞正鄉下人所接觸的書，這還是第一次。較以前，眞正鄕下人的讀物是有光紙石印的，再以前，則是木版雕刻的。現在鄉下已很少看到原本的木版書了，所僅見的幾種，一則是因爲木版需很大的成本，書商在版未毀壞時總勉力支持，二則有些僅有木版本的書籍在一地方有其延續的銷路，這狹窄的銷路，並不爲石印書商所注意。此外則凡屬有石印本的書籍，都早已把木版本驅逐盡意了。這吞併從幾時開始，鄉下自然沒有史料可以參考，大約是興火柴洋鏡同時侵入。其兼併之快，比洋鏡或者不及，比火柴確很有餘，就記憶所及說，我還曾購買過火刀火石，却不曾讀過非石印本的小說，彈詞。大槪推測，從石印術開始傳入，到石印書廣佈鄉間，其時間定遠較活版鉛字的初漸流行，到鈴印小說的侵入鄉間爲短。一折書到那一天才能完全吞併石印書，更不易推測。自然逐漸吞併是必然的，但從前從事石印業者，似乎抱着一種開闢新事業的精神，勇往直前，而現在的一折書，則是新書業走到無可發展時的勉力救濟，其進取的精神，當有不及。固然一方面因失業者日多很多人想在這方面找出路，販這樣的書到鄉村去推銷，而這種推銷在衰落的鄕村間能生多大的效力，也是有疑問的。　　此外，一折書的印行者，其廣大銷路，固以內地爲對象，而鄉村也被包括在內，但究竟不曾十分注意到鄕村，如果我在上海所曾在書店看到的一折書，足算所印行者的全部，則很多鄉間所最流行的書，就都還未印到，例如薄薄小冊的短篇彈詞就是。鄉下人的讀書，是頗有點固執的，這類彈詞，大槪是老祖母的幼年，一直流傳到現在，只有這一類書的閱讀才受得到老祖母們的鼓勵，有時且簡直是爲老祖母的愛聽而閱讀，老祖母雖然對這樣的故事，已不知聽過幾遍，但始終不覺得厭倦。或者眞無論那本書，都是愈讀愈有意味的，當爲老祖母讀彈詞的小孩們，也走入中年以後，就不覺又染上老祖母的習慣了。不過無論老祖母類的人物如何固執，改變終於改變了，我們不時總可聽到老祖母嘆息某種她幼年曾讀過或聽過的書的不可再得，這當然是爲石印書所淘汰了。如此，石印書對木版書的也有若干不同，當可想見，其相差程度，或不如石印書與鉛徘間相差之大。相差之大，固然將是石印書的壽命當較延長的理由，但也說不定造成將來淘汰之烈。不知道有人會覺得這類劣本石印書，將來也有成爲難得的珍本的可能否。　　這接連兩次的淘汰，逐漸勢將把內地各處的讀物統一，就某方面，也把品質提高。但同時也使鄉下人閱讀時增加困難，這將使鄉下人懶得得去讀，或使其加倍努力是不可知的。並且就使是使他們增加努力，似乎也是不必要的，譬如字體，鉛印書的流行，將使繁瑣的宋體的勢力日增，這與小學校初級讀本用楷體就先背馳，更不必說在被提倡中的簡字。我曾經幻想過，如果中國的雕版發明得遲些，抄寫書籍延長得久些，字體一定不似現在複雜，就雕版延長久些，活字發明遲些，也定不會行現用的宋體。現在鉛印書侵入鄉間，是達到他的極盛，但宋體字卻已走上他下坡的路了。這對於鄉下人，或不免是一重磨難。將來鄕下人又要讀什麼樣的書，現在是無法知道的。葡萄牙最偉大的詩人摩卡因西一生的顚沛  立波　　有的人說：「葡萄牙文學祗有一個詩人，一部作品，　詩人就是卡摩因西，作品就是他的琉息亞德。一這話雖然有些誇大，卡摩因西却眞是葡萄牙文學中的一朶無比的華麗的奇花，他的同時代的人物莎士比亞的對於英國，西萬提斯的對於西班牙的地位，也就是他在葡萄牙的地位。　　十六七世紀的葡萄牙並不像現在一般寂寞和萎縮，牠有强大的海軍，牠在海上爭奪殖民地，東衝西突；覇王的氣味，賽過了英吉利；牠的確是原始蓄積時代的一位浴血的英雄，牠產生了僥勇慄悍的海盜，也產生了歌頌海盜的「琉息亞德」；這首叙述一個老海賊的故事的「奧德賽以後最有力的海的詩篇」（約翰瑪茜），使卡摩因西的名字永垂不朽。　　除了「琉息亞德」（The　Lusiads，卡摩因西（Luis　Vaz　deCamoens）還有無數的詩篇。他的風格是非常多樣的。「牠們（他的詩）與雄圖和勝利的繁華的行列和情境相應；牠們帶着肉的魅力曲折，而又柔和；牠們能够揮動諷刺的鞭子彈奏神情蕩漾的愛的絃索，在鄉野的微風之下沙沙作響，伴着風濤澎湃，也和着恬靜酣歌。」（哥爾德堡）而最接近我們的要算是他對於他的民族國家的愛，他愛他的祖國和愛他的情人一樣的强烈，他是一位崇高的Poet-Palriot。在我們現在的地位，我們需要他。　　但是光榮時代的葡萄牙，並沒有把他看重；用終生的流離和顚沛，葡萄牙酬報了牠的最偉大的天才。他究竟生在什麼地方，什麼時候，沒有人確切知道。我們祗依稀知道他大概生在一五二四年，死於一五八〇年。是服務印度的一個殖民官的兒子。一五四四年他會見了葡萄牙皇上的宮人卡特林拉（Catherina），愛上了她，這是他的悲劇的生涯的開始，也就是他的歌喉煥發的開始。他追求宮人，大約在禮節上有了裂痕罷，不久受了宮庭的流放　　充軍一點也沒有减低，他的輕躁和熱烈。剛剛回來了他又重覆了不敬，於是第二次又被流放。這一回他們把他遠遠的送到了非洲。相傳到非洲的途中，在直布羅陀海狄，他的右眼喪失在摩洛哥海盜的手裏。吵眼和貧窮，使他的遭遇很像一荷馬。在非洲，他得到了後來再現在他的叙事詩裏的新奇經騐。「琉息亞德」大約在這時候開始動筆了，這期間他還寫了三個劇本。　　一五四九年，他回到了里斯本。貧窮和功敢的氣質使他參加了眾隊。那時候，葡萄牙帝國在非洲，巴西和印度到處挑動了戰爭。他被派到印度去。可是赴印度的前夜，因爲某種糾葛，他用劍刺傷了王的侍臣，於是在他和愛人最後一次相見的時候，他聽到了第三次充軍的宣判。這樣，赴印的期遲了三年。後來，遭了赦免，在一五五三年三月，他才正式被遣到印度去。這次離開祖國的時候，他很感傷，「忘恩負義的祖國呵，你不曾得到我的骸骨了。」他說。　　他到了科亞（GOA一個葡屬印度的城市，在阿拉伯海邊。）這地方起初待他還好，後來也和里斯本一樣和他作對了。他「是卑鄙的壞蛋的母親却是忠實人的繼母。」　　到科亞六個禮拜以後，他就參加了一次遠征，後來，他又參加了一千二百人遠征到紅海的戰爭。在這裏，我們用不着替他掩飾，在他的盲目的愛國情熱之下，他的劍是張了强者之膽的。但這不是他的時代所能想透的事，他愛他的祖國，他服從了祖國的命運。可是他的這熱情一點也沒有得到感謝，回到科亞的時候，長官又和他鬧翻了。他作了很多諷刺的詩歌，攻擊殲民官吏的弊政。　　一五五六年三月，他被派到中國，管理死去或不在的葡人的財產，河是在到中國的途中，他又在印度個荒島上，流落了兩年。到中國不久，又和長官不合，被送同科亞；在路上，海船破了，他損失了一切。一五六〇年在科亞上陸的時候，他期待着救濟，却來了捕捉他的法警！人家誣吿他受了賄，於是入獄。正在這個時候，他終生懷戀的宮人卡特林拉的死耗傳來了，他的不幸的生之悲劇達到了頂點。伏在這幽暗的人生角落裏，他祇有不絕的傾吐他的神樣的形式的詩情，他的許多優美的抒情詩，都是在這時候留給我們的。但是『田野不再靑了，樹林不再美麗，我留意牠們的豪華富麗的顏色太遲了，自然已經不再發出歡喜的花蒂「。（他自己的詩句）詩人這時的心境，是怎樣的難堪呵！　　出獄以後，負了一身的債。他渴望着迢迢故國的雲天。但窮和病把他這想望一直遷延一五六九·一五七〇年四月，他回到了里斯本·十六年已經在海外消磨·雄姿英發的靑年巳經走到銀髮斑斑的人生中路了·許多老友死了，愛人死了，里斯本祗是一座凄絕的愁城。祗有他的又老又窮的母親還在，娘兒兩個靠着一點點不够溫飽的贍養度日，相傳，他帶回來的個爪哇奴隸，在這時候常常在里斯本的街頭爲他們要飯。　　在這艱苦的泥潭裏，在一五七二年，葡萄牙的藝苑永不凋謝的一朶鮮花—「琉息亞德」長成了。以後不到八年，他就死去。遭了三次遠地的流放，一次入獄；多少次海中險阻，荒島的飄零，官塲的仇視，愛人的永遠離隔，還有餓飯與孤凄的襲擊。他自己說得很對：「誰曾聽說，在這像一張可憐的臥榻一般的小小舞臺上，命運却演出了這麼大的不幸呢？」　　不幸的高壓，間或使他吐出許多傷感詩句：一骸骨的葬處是怎樣容易找尋！海洋的任一波浪，大地的任一皺紋，無論什麼長眠處，異鄉，故國，都可以做成一切英雄屍體的新墳。」　　可是，愛神的翼，永遠在他的頭上撲撲的飛，生命河的流水，永遠在他的胸上湧溢，正如李查柏頓的話，他有「多情的心」「英雄的手」，在他的金色的書葉裏，他記下了「愛，名譽，正義，豪氣，光榮的顫慄」，却不大看見不冷不熱不愛不恨的俗物的男女。　　在他謳歌男敢的葡萄牙人的時候，有這樣的詩句：「你，冒着各方面的死的迫逼，還是傳播生命的　音，直到永遠一。哭他的愛人的時候：「他們說得很對，你燃燒的渴，狂熱的愛，决不會被最憂傷的淚球澆滅。」這是他的自白的一片。（完）大學時代（三）（二）  德國施托謨著陳隱之譯　　『跳舞會？』我驚訝地問；『誰在這林子裏頭跳舞呢？』　　『是那些大學生老爺啊！』他回答，並帶點輕藐態度，注意我這套不甚時髦的服裝；『他們主持道裏的跳舞會的。』　　我突然想起在家時接到一個朋友來信，信中有這種暗示。我們把牠呌做『魔術師底深夜聚會』；鬧得天昏地暗　』信上的話就是這樣說的。我現在知道這話說的是甚麼了，我祗把這地點忘記了。　　僕歐似乎不喜歡聽這『魔術師聚會』底稱呼。當我還要用這稱呼去窘迫他時候，忽然有二個靑年人，我不認識的大學生，走上山來。他們一點不注意我，便坐在門那　邊長凳上，一面用光銳的聲音和粗暴的表情各人吩咐一杯啤酒。僕歐走開以後，我就聽見他們二人間斷續的談話，關於今夜跳舞會的；他們一面閒談，一面口裏打着唿唷或者呵欠。其中一個顯然是個『後輩』，才入學不久的，似乎是現在由他那比較年長的同伴口裏，才知道今晚跳舞會底情形。這年長的大學生把那些舞女們一個個地描摹了，描摹得很扼要，但在他的話中那些舞女並沒有甚麼出色當行的，其中有一個是跳舞敎師底女兒，有一個是醉鬼警察的女兒：靠着他們二人幫助，這跳舞會才能成立。其他舞女是一些沒有朋友和親長的姑娘，牠們是依靠白天做工來維持生活的。　　此時我默不作聲地吃我的早餐，一面喂養一個鶯鳥，牠一點不害怕在石板上走來走去，喙食我丟下去的麵包屑。　　『你才應當見見伯爵夫人哩！』那個年長的大學生又說，一面捻他的小鬍子。　　那一個則發出一個驚奇的問題。　　他的朋友笑了起來：『那祗是一個女裁縫，路得維希！但你要看她那氷冷地看人的神氣！——她簡直是謫落塵凡的安琪兒！』　　「爲甚麼你們稱她做伯爵夫人呢』　　『你不知道麼，那個「土伯爵」上了她啊！』兩個女性的型（下）  齊吾文　　他差不多沒有等待我答應，便拿起電話來打到章家去。在電話裏，他再三的約她出來，但對方不是推說這個時候有客，便說那個時候要陪母親上街，最後，我的同學臉也紅了，用懇求的語氣說，要介紹給她見面的是一個很好的朋友，而且今天就走，她才不十分肯定地答應在八點到九點之間到一間咖啡店裏見面。　　我們吃過午飯，離約會的時間還有半天，便跑到英租界去看電影。英租界本來不是天津熱鬧的所在，這時街上的行人沒有幾個，而且除了黃臉孔外，差不多全是白俄。準備着明天慶祝英皇登極紀念的英國舖子的懸燈結字，也掩不住街上的冷落景况。電影院裏更是空空的坐着十幾個人，而且其中大半是唇紅於血的白俄女人。電影散塲後，我們緩步跑到法租界的天祥市塲和勸業塲一帶去，大都會的黃昏，往日在這裏是可以看到的，這回却絕不感到一點擾攘喧鬧。連低低的挽着髻，臂上套上翠玉鐲，穿上平底繡花鞋，鹅蛋臉兒北方姨太太型的女人也碰不到。天津的確有點改態了。　　我們隨便在一間館子吃了夜飯，好容易捱到七點鐘，便坐洋車一直跑到那間咖啡店等候章小姐去。　　咖啡店是外國人開的，那陳舊不合時的椅桌陳設，不够明亮的燈光那顏色已帶啦暗的呆板的壁畫，吿訴我們這咖啡店巳是前世紀的產物。這時的顧客不上十個人在一個臺角上，幾個猶太人和白俄人似的中年胖子，正圍着一張桌子聚精會神地下棋。烟草的薄霧由他們那兒吐出來，散漫各處。　　我們呌了兩杯咖啡，一邊喝，一邊談着。談話自然是拿章小姐做中心。我的同學以微帶驕傲的口吻告訴我說，先有意思的還是章小姐。她雖然還沒有實在中學畢業，但彈得一手鋼琴，現在正請人在家裏敎北派的漢畫盡。說到思想一方面，當然不能苛求，可是她還能諒解我的同學，有回我的同學對着她半帶笑半認眞的把她的老官僚的父親駡了一頓，她也沒有生氣。不過，不得她家庭的許可而訂婚——這就是說在我的同學沒有找到職業以前而訂婚——她自己也覺得不好的　　我的同學還說，他們倆第一次見面就是在這間咖啡店，後來他們常常到這裏來；他們常一塊去看電影，跳舞，也曾同酣醉在庫拉蘇酒的芳烈之下，互感到心的顫動……　　在談話的中間，我的同學隔一會便看他的手錶，一聽見鞋聲，便起來向外頭張望。八點半了，八點三刻了，快到九點鐘了，章小姐的踪跡還是渺然，很顯然的送進來一陣高跟鞋的得得的聲音，但來的却是一個穿紅色衣裳的中國舞女。　　『這回恐怕拆爛汚吧』？我的同學一邊說一邊離開桌子往前頭打電話去。剛走了一會，我便瞥見一個穿着深綠色夾大衣的靑年女人踱進來。我猜這　定就是章小姐了，正要起來招呼，我的同學已飛也似的跑進來。他把我介紹給章小姐之後，連忙替她脫大衣，讓她坐在他的身旁，替她倒了一杯紅茶。我們寒暄幾句之後，便隨便的找些話頭談起來：由音樂繪畫說到北平的居處和園林之美　　在談話中間，我偷偷的打量她。看起她大約有廿三四歲的樣子，深綠色的綢子淤袍罩着中等的身段，頭髪和嘴唇都沒有加以人工的裝節，帶有酒渦的豐圓的臉龐只薄勻上一點粉。微蹙的眉峯下有一雙頗大的靈活的眼睛。她的確是當得Charmilg和Intelligent，兩字—特別是在她微笑和雙眸轉動的時候。她的淸越的口音是典型的北京女子的口音，說話流利而自然。但是，當她單獨跟我的同學談話的時候，她那種嬌養到任性似的女孩子的神氣又流露出來，從這裏看見她的天眞，又看見她的女性的驕傲。例如當我的同學向她訂第二次的約會的時候，她搖着頭說道：　　『這要看我的高興了』！　　當我們說到北京怎樣好的時候，我的同學向她說道！　　『讓我們一塊到北京去玩玩吧』？　　『我們兩個去嗎？我不去，只要我的媽去才去』。這是她的乾脆的答語。我的同學碰了一個釘子，外交的詞令有點窮了。　　我們這樣子隨便談了一會，離我預定趁的火車的開行時候已近了。她很客氣的跟同我的同學送到車站去。在這一對熱戀着的愛人的倩影之前，我又離開天津了。我祝他們永遠保持着他們的愛的幻夢吧！點滴  （心仁）　　植物彎曲了枝幹，或者伸長了枒枝，倒垂下茂葉，做出許多奇形怪狀，無非是爲了要多承一點露水，多受一點陽光。人　裝着笑臉，流出眼淚，爬在地上，不穿衣裳，裸露了肉體，做出種種比植物更要奇怪的　態惡相，爲什麼？無非是為着幾個老錢。　　兩人同樣的體質，同樣的年齡，在同一個時間裏，得着同一個危險的急病，一個請醫生，一個請不起醫生，結果一死一生，誰都可以明瞭：那生的是錢給他生的，那死的是病使他死的。可是細一想，却知道生和死的最後取决權都是在錢上。　　由此出發，舉一反二地，我們可以知道事業的成敗，戰爭的勝負，人類的苦，地地位尊尊卑，以及一切榮辱的發生，無不被决於錢。　　如若有人要問世界上那一國人最懂得踐的功能？我將毫不遲疑的吿訴你：是中國人。中國人非但活着要錢，並且知道已死的人也需要錢用，所以願意把有用的錢去兌了冥通銀有的鈔票，化爲灰燼，作死者取用。若非此人深明錢的功能，聰明絕頂，盍能想得如此周到？欲得勿得是最得  枕綠　　「西潮名勝甲天下」，一欲把西湖比西子……」，一切稱美西湖的啟不積儲在我的內裏，我每逢見到一幅西湖的風景片就會神馳，聽到一次西湖的遊歷談就會心動；越久越相思，以爲此生終須一到西湖，到過了西湖纔能滿足，纔算不枉。後來我得有機會，果然到臨西湖，親身賞覽，領略，卽證到一切意想中的西湖縈緻—西湖的佳妙處了。可是我到過西湖之後，我反覺得我已失掉我的西湖—我從前所有愛而不見，思慕無窮，不知怎樣佳妙的西湖了！我追悔我爲什麼去這一次西湖，很愚蒙的平白地放棄了我這最神秘的最美麗的理想世界，消滅了我足以冥索神遊的資料；我將無從再得這等樣的滿足了！我把實踐西湖代替了懸想西湖，眞是我的失策—我精神上最重大的損失！　　同樣的，好色的人兒遇見一個合於他理想的絕色美人，不勝神魂顚倒，寤寐求之！他當苦心焦思的追逐之時，抱有極度的野心，長陷緊張的情緒，憧憬於消魂的剎那，沈醉於甜蜜的未來，—他擁有多麼幸福的預約券呵！一旦他果然得到那如花美香，同時他便失去了好色的思想的重心了！所以有人說：「妻不如妾……，」終於「偷得着不如偷不着」呢。　　我願大家終不要去得到那最欲得到的東西，使其長保持着永新的意義，這纔是眞正的滿足；這等人纔是最聽明的人！甌北牙慧  康健齋夫　　性靈派詩人趙甌北與並時袁子才蔣心餘鼎足而三，晚歲杜門一編，翛然自遠，而享壽獨高。當其興酣落筆，不拘格調，雄麗奇恣，輒令讀者游心駭目，不忍釋手。如論詩云：「詩非苦心作不成，佳處又非苦心造。偶於無意爲詩處，得一兩句自然好。」又「眞仙不藉舊丹火，神醫自有新藥方。能勝大敵始稱勇，豈就矮人乃見長。」　　常作突兀奇想，不肯一語落平。例如詠大銀杏樹句有「生於平地不自量，其意欲與山爭高。……樹中此亦巨無覇，俯視萬木皆兒曹。倘更長養千百歲，天公亦恐觸膂腰。……」　　其豪壯處如「恨不借祖龍火，燒盡好詩獨剩我。恨不借黃虎刀，殺盡才士讓我豪。……」　　其幽默處如譏王夢樓茹素繁費云：「有如寡婦雖不嫁，偏從淡雅矜素妝。衣裁縞袂曉雪色；佩綴白璧夜月光。遊行梅花李花下，自謂守節追共姜。吾知其心未必凈，招之仍可入洞房。……」　　風韵處如啖荔枝句有「肌膚姑射白；風味玉環肥。……老夫情不禁，爲脫絳羅衣。」又「甘夫人臥絳紗中，一擘驚看白如玉。半腴應笑只識酥，鮮潔兼令不思肉。」　　寫田家風味句如「露綻葡萄肥馬乳；風搖薛荔活龍鱗。」如「紅　挺生剛有骨；紫薇怕癢嬾無皮。」如「待波馬嘶芳草岸；歇凉人語綠楊邨。」皆饒有新境。　　至其五古，靈感包孕，奇思橫溢，益如萬花競豔，美不勝擷矣。三官菩薩  茸餘　　我現在所說的「三官菩薩」，並不是廟宇中金裝泥塑受人禮拜的尊神，却是街頭上沿門托缽人人厭惡的叫化。爲甚麼有這稱號呢？因爲這三個乞丐一塊兒出發，一塊兒乞討，一塊兒休息，正和稗官上的「孟良焦贊」「張保王橫」的影形不離，所以便有這個雅號。　　「三官菩薩」的名稱一傳揚，他們原來的名姓倒湮沒無聞了，好在他們是一個渺小的乞丐，也沒人請敎他尊姓大名，這點倒也滿不在乎。他們的乞討，好像一個三合公司，又可以說「有福共享有難同當」。因爲不論討得一杯殘羹，一碗冷炙，總是三個人公分；要是一個人病了，二個人出來乞討，那病的也有一份兒，這點倒使社會上縉紳先生有些慚愧。因爲普通人合夥做一件事；起先是義薄害漢，到後來分贓不勻鬧意見，不肯負責也要吵分家；任你訂了合同，喝了血酒，也會反臉，這眞不及他們咧！他們一年二年，……從我小時瞧見，直到現今仍在一塊，這倒不是一件易事咧　　人家說「人窮志短」。普通的乞丐們，瞧見沒有人時，總免不掉偷偷摸摸；而這「三宮菩薩」却像金字招牌一般的挺硬，從沒有這一回事。而且他到了一家人家，見到人們不在，東西雜放的當見，還要高聲喊叫，叮囑你們「小心」，因此他們也得到人們一些兒好感。不像普通乞丐的招人厭惡。　　婚喪喜慶的人家，是乞丐的好主顧，「三官菩薩」總比旁的同行來得先得消息。他們一到，向主人道了幾聲喜，便在門口替你做些輕便的雜事，像掃掃地，扛抬桌椅，人家瞧見他這般的殷勤，除了酒醉飯飽之外。還要加倍的開發咧！　　訂正　前日「消夏號」內「沈市長導導覜鄕村」詩二首，查係沈信卿先生所吟，特爲聲明。有理無理的天文問答　　問：天地是什麼？答：天地一沙鷗。（杜甫）　　問：靑雲在那裏的？答：靑雲在目前。（高適）　　問：白雲有沒有盡的時候的？答：白雲無盡時。（王維）　　問：太陽出在那裏的？答：日出正東峯。（李頎）　　問：月亮是那裏明的？答：月是故鄕明。（杜甫）　　問：凉風起自什麼地方？答：凉風起天末。（杜甫）　　問：風急打在那裏的？答：風急打船頭。（杜甫）　（孫麟昌）　　問：雨來沾在什麼地方？答：雨來沾席上。（杜甫）（孫麟昌）御香縹緲錄  淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯　　比較遼遠的省分，如兩廣雲貴等處，多半要待各方所獻的貢品聚集成數之後，才躉批的一次起運入京，以免零零碎碎的遞送；所以儘有許多珍貴的東西，要先在督撫大人那裏擱上十天半月的；可是這些東西旣已指定是貢給朝廷的了，督撫大人當然也不能去移動或竊取，就是故意讓它們多擱幾時，也是於法不合的。而那一位廣東撫台老爺却膽敢用了種種的狡計，不顧皇法，私自藏匿了許多名貴的貢品；事發之後，那些曾以貢品進上的官員已開出了一張很長很長的淸單上來，藉以蹬明給他所侵占的貢品的數目。太后派去查辦的人，對此也已蹬實了。所以歸結一句話，那廣東撫台的罪狀已是完全成立了！　　罪狀旣已成立，少不得就要議到怎樣處罰他了，這位撫台老爺在過去，確然是太后很寵信的一位大臣，如今突然的給人家證實了他的罪惡，當然是使太后非常痛心疾首的，大家都猜不定伊將怎樣的去處罰這個叛臣；依理說，此番的處罰定然是很嚴厲的，但我却知道太后可不是一個一味嚴厲的人，伊有時也很仁慈，這可以把十幾天以前所發生的黃河水災一事來做例證。（三七六）小西天  張恨水著　　第十七回　莫問女兒身難言隠痛爭看貴人臉共仰高風　　當李士廉說出那句忘八之詞，本來是激將法，想激得張介夫非吃他一頓不可。事情是那麼凑巧，恰好楊浣花這時由外面進來，只把那句話聽了半截，他以爲李士廉就算很開通，也不該自己承認是那東西。張介夫在得意的時候，却也來不及和別人去打算，笑道：要不要李先生當那東西，那權在於我。他說這話時的院子裏正有好些個人遠遠的站着，都微微地笑了。其實張介夫這幾句話若是好好的加以解釋，倒也不見有什麼侮辱之處，唯其是這樣含混的說着，李士廉是感到無地縫可鑽，假使有地縱可鑽，他也就鑽到地縫裏去了。楊浣花看到他臉上由紅變紫，皮膚被血漲着，幾乎眼睛都要睜不開來，這就不便把這笑話，只管說了下去，因道：李先生，我明天走了，在這裏許多事都蒙你帮忙。李士廉也正是找不着梯子下台，聽了這話便笑道：那恭喜你，算是跳出火坑了。盤纏拿到手了嗎？浣花笑道：火車票有了，一路零用的錢，還不够，我想……多找幾位老翁帮帮忙罷。說時，飄了介夫一眼，介夫却望了院子門外。（二七六）拉雜話歧黃趣史  尤愛梅　　某縣有個敎書匠，精研歧黃之術，却不肯懸壺問世，後經親友們敦勸，纔於每日淸晨，替人診兩小時的病。祇收號金一百文，且以下人爲限。有一次一個富家公子，慕名前來求診，却　經滿號了。這位公子，但掏出大洋一元，請他破例一診，誰知他接過錢來，竟往門外一拋。那公子碰了這一鼻子灰，因他是個不掛牌的儒醫，却奈何他不得。他的脾氣，雖這樣古怪，本領却是眞好。他立下了規矩，凡是來就診的，不准自報病情，否則不診，他只要二個指頭，在病人脈上一搭，便源源本本的批判出來，如數家珍。而且口吻異常滑稽。我鄕柘溝莊某甲，平素是濕痰的體質，偏生肝陽又旺，歷請名醫診治，皆無兩全之策，便不辭跋涉幾百里路，到他那裏求治。只聽他按着脈大駡道；「這些醫生，膿包得緊！水來燒把火，火來澆盆水，怎會一齊除根呢？」後來，果然經他治好了。某甲又親見有一個人，愈傷食的毛病，同時在那裏就診。他按着脈，也是大駡道：「好吃嘍；好吃嘍；吃出病來，跑來害我了一眞可謂妙人妙語，令人捧腹。　　某村有兩位醫生，分居前後兩　；都是很直明的。而他倆有點互相嫉妬，競爭甚烈。凡是前莊醫生，沒有醫好的病人，只要到後莊來，無論怎樣，都要法外設法的醫治。反之，後莊沒醫好，而到前莊的，也是這樣。一次，有兩個少不更事的靑年，在元　佳節，忽然高興，賭食湯糰子。甲吃了十枚，再也吃不下了。乙吃十枚，也就難以下咽，但乙好勝心重，又多吃了六枚，却巳阻在喉嚨口了。霎時色變氣喘，橫身躺下。甲見狀大驚，速忙告知乙家，將乙就近抬在前莊醫生家裏。醫生只是搖頭說：「無法可治」。只得又抬到後莊來，那知也是束手。乙的家人乖淚道：「兩位高醫，都不肯治，看來他是死路一條了」後莊醫生，聽得此言，忽然站起來道：「原來你已到過前莊麼？那無論如何，都得想法」於是，沉吟有頃，隨命學生撮了藥來，親自煎了，捧給乙吃。却是一碗濃厚潔白的湯汁。乙的家人問道：「這是什麼藥？怎麼是白色呢？」醫生道：「人參湯」。乙的家人大驚道：「這種病，怎麼能吃補藥呢？」醫生笑道：「我自有道理」。便命乙服了。約過一盞茶時，先把乙扶了坐上馬桶，才又煎出一碗黑色藥湯來，給他吃。服下以後，沒多一會，便大瀉不止，汗出如漿。瀉畢起身，其病若失。再看馬桶裏時，糞汁很少，却有一條粗如酒杯口，長如吹火棒的白麵糰兒。原來吃的湯糰，已冰結成一塊，完全被藥打下來了。這時，醫生才向乙的家人解釋道：「他這病，雖是傷食而起，本是實症，但他氣機爲積食所阻，遂有虛象，若不先用補劑，輔助他的正氣，就先去攻滯，那就一瀉氣脫，絕無生理咧」。於是羣皆嘆服。　　以上所述，兩則故事，距今皆不出十年。可惜常時作者年幼，只知貪聽情節，所以，於其地名，人名，却皆早已忘記，無從記述了。</p>

<p>申報醫藥周刊從鄉村醫藥衛生的重要說到鄒平鄉村建設醫院  起疴　　人生重要的，莫過於生命，假使生命不存在，整個世界一切化爲烏有，而生命最容易感到威脅或受傷害的；英過於疾病，所以疾病實在是生命發展上一個大的障碍，欲求生命之延續，非想法避免疾病之侵襲，得安全之保障不可。今世科學昌明，醫學發達，各種疾病都有治療和預防的方法，對人類社會實爲一大的貢獻。現在各文明國家，對於治療機關和公共衛生椎行，極爲努力，例如英國，據衛生部總醫官一九二六年之報吿：衛生機關所設的產婦健康檢查所，有四一七所，嬰孩保健所有一四八零處，學校診療處有一三九五處，肺病診療所有四百四十二處，肺病療養院有二百二十一處，花柳病診療所有一九零處，向政府請爲健康保險者，至一千四百餘萬人之衆，政府所用醫師達一萬四千餘名之多，此外因注重居往衛生而改良人民住宅所費之欵，在一千八百萬鎊之譜，辦理救護等　業所費之數，有五千萬鎊之鉅；以這樣大的鉅欵來辦理衛生事業，實屬可驚，以我國極幼稚的衛生設備相比擬，實不董「滄海之一粟」。並且人生的健康，不特關係於一已，就是與整個民族國家國也有很大的關係；國家興衰，全視乎人民的强弱，人民强健，則社會中生產力增加，經濟富裕。反之；全國人民都是奄奄待斃的病夫，只消費而不生產，增大國家之支出，國卽弱，爲最顯著的例子，我國今日已到民窮財盡的時候，生產力日益减低，號稱以農立國的國家，大宗米麥等農產品，猶仰給於人，人民的不康健影響於生產减少，不能不說是一大原因，我國農民雖以忍苦耐勞著稱於世，然究竟敵不過處列拉，痢疾，　疾，傷　等病的襲，估計我每年寃死者不下六百萬人，損失約三十萬萬元，民族國家受　此重大損失，殊令人不寒而慄！又我國每日約有病者一千六百萬人，種種事業因而停頓，　損失更不可勝計！更據衛生署一九三〇年關於世界各國死亡率比較，足以證明中國醫藥衛生設備不可或緩，每千人中死亡率，中國爲三〇·〇，二本爲一八·七，法國爲一一·六，英國爲一一·三，德國爲一一·三，澳洲爲八·六，從上述的數字看來，我國的死亡率，均二倍於只他各國，這是多麼可怕，爲吾人　可不注！我們細細地去想想：容易生病，死多最多的，究竟是些什麼人？這當然是鄉村人了，因爲我們國家的組成，是由二三十萬村落組成，雖然有三五個較大的都市，這裏的人口是最少數的；並且他們在中國都市畸形發展中，什麼醫院呢，公共衛生設備呢，他們都能享受，而鄕村人民鎭日有畜舍的糞坑旁邊，與馬牛羊鷄犬豕作朋友，衛生當然談不到，疾病之來，只有付諸命運，能得鄉村中無經騐的庸醫，診一次脈吃一劑藥，便算是難能貴了，這是多麼可憐啊！科學的進步，爲的是大多數人類享受，醫藥衛生的設備，應當是社會化才是正常形態的發展。鄒平醫院的設立，最重要的是爲了這個原因，現在讓我來說明他的組織和業務罷！鄒平縣中原來無衛生設備，去年始成立醫院一所，他不只是消極的治療疾病，還積　的作預防的工夫；所以他是醫而兼衛生院，與由東齊魯大學合作，聘請醫師三人及護士四人，來院指導縣中衛生　宜，及診治疾病，每月經費一一〇〇元，中央衛生實騐處每月撥助一八〇元，齊魯大學每日撥助二〇〇元，該縣地方捐每　撥助一五〇元，其餘由鄒平研究院担負，其組織共分四組：（一）衛生組，A衛生工作人員訓練，B社會衛生敎育，C衛生敎育，（二）　健組，A婦孺衛生，B學校衛生，傳染病制止，C環　衛生，（三）衛務組，A醫藥管理，B病理檢騐，C診療，（四）總務組，A文書，B庶務，C會計，該院治病並不取醫藥費，每次初診，僅取掛號銅元十枚，復診取四枚，赤貧者完全免費，故住該院治病者頗爲踴躍，每月診病人約　三〇〇〇人、，去年秋天，曾開衛生展覽會，嬰兒健康比賽會，作擴大宣傳，參加者亦頗不少，更爲推廣計：擬各鄉設立鄕村分診所，及鄉問衛生指導員，現該院正在訓練衛生助　員十五人，分赴各鄉種牛痘，預本年可種五萬人，小小的鄒平，能有這樣的一個醫院，來診治疾病和指導公共衛生，實在是鄉村人民的福音，希望全國作鄕村運動的朋友們，建設鄉村不要忽略了人民的健康罷！疾病常識問答  程瀚章　　（六十二）慢性腸黏膜炎　　（問）慢性腸黏膜炎是怎樣發生的？　　（答）大多數是從急性腸　膜炎遷延不治而轉成的；又有遭遇着像急性的許多原因，開始就發生慢性腸黏膜炎的。也有因爲肝臟病，肝門脈病，循環器病和傳染病而續發的。　　（問）慢性腸黏膜炎，發生之後，病人覺得怎樣？　　（答）慢性腸黏膜炎的病人，全身狀態並不異樣；可是胸部常覺得膨漲，不快，和騷鳴。神精過敏，成爲刺戟性，肌緊張消失，工作懈怠，精神沉衰。並沒有發熱或腸內絞痛等情。　　（問）病人的胃內，起有變化嗎？　　（答）往往見胃酸减少或缺乏。　　（問）併洩大便，每天大槪有幾次？　　（答）每天總得排出二三次或二三次以上的大便。　　（問）大便的色澤和形狀怎樣？　　（答）大便是稀薄液狀或粥狀，大多呈暗赤色；有時隔以數天的正常便而再排出泄瀉便的。　　（問）大便中有些什麼雜質？　　（答）有混些黏液成小片狀；又含食物的殘渣，帶惡奧。　　（問）患了這種慢性黏膜炎，要經過多少時候纔得治愈？　　（答）經過很慢，至少要經過數月，甚至經過數年而不能完全治愈的。　　（問）還有更重的慢性腸黏膜炎嗎？　　（答）有一種是因爲僞足蟲　，汞毒等而起的比前面講的一種慢性腸黏膜炎更重。　　（問）這種病狀怎樣？　　（答）　初是不知不覺；後來逐漸排出黏液血液和膿性的便。有伴以裏急後重和腹痛的。　　（問）這種症慢性腸黏膜炎，身體發熱嗎？　　（答）勢　進的時　，有發熱的。　　（問）在這種病的經過中，起什麼合併症？　　（答）往往起淮行性貧血，胃酸減少，關節種脤，膀胱賢孟炎等症。　　（問）這種病的預後，吉凶如何？　　（答）預後大槪不良，起惡液質，貧血，敗血症而致命。　　（問）應當和那幾種病相區別？怎樣可以確　？　　（答）應當和腸癌，腸結核，腸梅毒，直腸淋疾等相區別。確定的方法，可行直腸鏡檢查。　　（問）慢性腸黏膜炎的治療法，是怎樣的？　　（答）先治其原因病變；此外行對症療法，注意飲食。介紹一個花柳病診療所  宋國賓　　人們　到花柳二字，無不談虎色變，牠的害人之深，傳染之烈，眞可謂罄竹難書了！因爲這個緣故，所以治花柳病的醫生也獨多，就以上海一地而論，也就着實可觀了！但是這些診療機關之中，是否都是採用最合理的療法呢？這句話，恐怕誰都不敢說的。我們從這「花柳病醫生之多」一點上，可以見得患花柳病者之多，我們再從「最合理治療機關之少」一點上，更可以推想到花柳病者在治療上所得着的保險！　　所謂治療上的危險有一：一是盲目的治療，二是不徹底的治療。　　（一）盲目的治療患花柳病的人往往以爲是一件可恥的事，但同時也知道牠的利害，可以一方雖秘不告人，而另一方面則求醫心切，求醫的指南，無疑地是報紙上的廣吿了！伊們看見價廉效速的廣吿，信以爲眞，欣然枉顧，結果，不是花柳也是花柳，黃包素，九一四，亂打一陣，弄到後來，不但病不見好，金錢時間的損失，已是無可挽救！這原因，就是這班醫生檢查的設備不全，診到不確，認症不眞，自然亂醫一起，前者是病人盲目的求治，後者是醫生盲目的治療，何等的危險呵！　　（二）不徹底的治療花柳病—尤其是梅毒—决非短期間所能治愈的，要在繼續不斷，非到相當時問，不能除根，一般人在打過幾針九一四之後，自以爲病已好了，治療可以停止了，殊不知不開始注射九一四則已，否則不繼續注射，危險此一針不打還要大，卽使自身幸免，而流毒子孫，傳染他人，眞是貽禍無窮呢！　　因爲上述二種花柳病治療上的危險，於是中華醫學會乃有「花柳病預防協會」的組織，而託黃子方先生負責進行，組織的宗旨，就是要以最新最合理的療法，來拯救一班失足花叢者於苦海，幾度的籌備，於是有「上海花柳病診療所」的產生。本所之優點有六！（一）設備完全，凡是花柳病診療上應用的各種器具和藥品，無不力求完備。（二）治療合理，開飴治療之前，必行顯微鏡檢查，或血淸反應等手續，非有確切的診斷，不施治療，以免盲目的危險。（三）診療免費，爲便利無力求醫的病者，和希望他們能繼續診</p>

<p>治以達除根的目的起見，本所不但一切手續費不收，藥品也是贈送。但這種權利，祗有眞正貧民始能享受，如果調查該病人有力求醫，本所决不收治，以免損害一般同業同道的利益。（四）地點適中，本所設於西藏路時濟醫院內，英法兩租界居民就診甚便。（五）時間經濟，診療時間定有晚間七時至九時，其目的在不妨礙病人之工作時問。（六）專家診洽，上海專家醫師，往往身價甚高，無力病人，求診不易，今本所醫師，均是正式專家輪流値診，亦貧病者難得之機會。　　總之，本所的治療是力求合理，對於病人是力求體貼，鄙人參與籌備，故知之甚詳，用特介紹於一般花柳病患者。耳鼻喉眼衛生常識  唐仁縉　　（五十七）喉頭結核　　結找一症範圍頗廣。各個臟器均可發生。生於肺臟的，稱爲肺結核。生於腸管的，稱爲腸結核。生於腎臟的，稱爲腎結核。這等結核都是我們普通所知道的。我現在要講的。是一種生於喉頭的結核。稱爲喉頭結核。喉頭結核多爲肺結核的合併症。在肺結核的各期各型均能發生。但是併發於初期的較多。喉頭結核狠少原發性的。試考它的統計。則各有不同。在歐美各國諸名醫及各病理解剖研究院的統計。平均爲百分之六至九十七。不過我對於這個統計的百分率。未免覺得牠的相差過遠。比較確實的統計。要算最近德國立克曼氏（Rickmanu，L.的一個報告。就是患肺結核生前證明喉頭已有結核性病變的。平均爲百分之二十五至三十。死後解剖始得證明的。平均爲百分之五十。　　喉頭結核發生於小兒的狠少（除爲重症電擊性粟粒結核）。多發生於二十歲至四十歲的成人。但是亦有在老年期方始發生本病的。從性的關係上講起來。男子比較女子爲多。牠的比例。是二比一。然而在有職業的女子。則未必成此比例。因爲比較容易感染本病的緣故。　　本病的初期。多爲一側性。聲帶的運動。亦多無障碍。牠的好發部位。依其多寡。順次分述如左。　　（一）在喉頭後壁生浸潤。牠的粘膜。膨出於兩聲帶的中間。呈腫瘍狀所以聲帶發音的時候。受其障碍。而發嘶嗄（嘶嗄就是喉啞）。　　（二）在聲帶起浸潤。呈灰白色。或淡紅色。具肥厚性。無顯著的邊緣。此時聲帶雖可自由運動。但是牠所發的音調。多帶嘶嗄性。　　（三）以假聲帶作喉頭結核的發源地。多在該帶的下緣。發生侵潤腫脹。達高度時。則聲帶亦受影響。而發嘶嗄。　　（四）於喉頭竇的粘膜。發生腫脹。色呈淡紅。　　（五）在會厭軟骨的中央部。起浸潤。但甚少。（待續）現代花柳病學通俗演講（十一）  陳生白（編述）殷木强（校正）　　第二編　淋病　　由上述之經過。可知一染淋疾。則以求治愈早爲愈妙。蓋在淋疾之初期。侵犯之範圍旣小。侵犯之病變又淺。藥物之奏效較易。及至慢性時期。則雖有名醫。亦難用决截之手段。罹此病者。幸勿河漢斯言。　　（二）取慢性經過之理由　　淋病之發生。或初以急性而變成慢性。或無何等急性之症狀。卽取慢過經過者有之。此何故　。爲解答讀者之疑竇計。因綜合各家之學說。附述如次。　　淋菌之在早期。並不起急性炎症。而呈亞急或慢性經過者。據臨床之報吿。亦數見不鮮。其原因。雖尙無明確之解釋。但亦不出下舉三種之推想。　　a淋菌之毒力不强。　　b患者對於病原菌有免疫性。　　c以罹患部粘膜之變化。不適於淋菌之發育。致淋菌不能於早期盛行其繁殖。　　雖然。在（A）當慢性淋病時。吾人殊不能證明其毒力之减少。卽實騐上。淋菌之毒力。無論其爲急性期　慢性期。其毒力固無可差別。已經Jadassohn，Westheim等氏所瞪明。　　在（B）—個體對於病原菌有免疫性之存在。據事實之吿訴已不能證實之。蓋已患淋疾者。每屢見再感染之發生也。　　在（C）—罹患部之粘膜。已失去其對於淋菌作繁殖之適當性者。乃事實也。在慢性淋病患者之粘膜上。若移殖以他菌種時。亦得發生與淋疾同一之症狀。但此時。其經過輕而且短。蓋該粘膜已在某種程度下。失其爲淋菌之培養地之性能也。此依Westheim，Finger，Jadassohn氏之實騐。已彰彰明甚。一言以蔽之。卽由於粘膜上細胞之變性。而得享有特有之免疫性耳。　　是以慢性經過之原因。一方由於爲淋菌之培養地之粘膜。已失其相當之適應性。而他方由於淋菌在患者之尿道粘膜面已减少其發育之勢力。換言之。卽淋病之取慢性經過者。不得不歸因於粘膜與淋菌。有至某程度下之習慣性所使然也。　　第二節淋病之症狀（一）男子之淋病　　甲，急性淋菌性前尿道炎初爲尿道外口之瘙癢感及漏出少量之粘液。次分泌黃白色膿樣之物質。排尿之際。有輕度之疼痛。至全盛時期，則排尿時之疼痛益劇。甚至放散於鼠蹊，會陰，睪丸等部尿道有灼熱威。漏出多址之黃綠色濃厚膿汁。陰莖包皮亦腫脹發熱。同時陰莖背面之淋巴管。形成疼痛性索狀物。或以鼠蹊淋巴腺之腫脹疼痛或化膿。或淋病性橫痃者有之。此外以陰莖充血之結果。發生疼痛性勃起或遺精。是爲病者所痛恨之症狀。又以勃起而破壞尿道粘膜之擴張之血管。則起小出血。而膿汁遂呈暗赤色矣。　　乙，急性淋菌性後尿道炎後尿道炎之主症。爲尿意頻數。排尿後會陰部有壓重，灼熱及疼痛感。排尿終末漏出數滴之純血。一時性尿閉。及薦骨痛與便秘等。　　前後尿道炎之症狀旣略述如上。惟在實際上。當後尿道炎之際。不發前尿道炎症狀者。幾無之，只其輕重有不同耳。　　丙，慢性淋菌性前後尿道炎僅於每朝起床時。在尿道外口見灰白色或黃色之少量分泌物。尿僅溷濁。或在淸澄之尿水中浮遊多數之淋絲（Tripperfaeden）。淋絲者。形似（，）狀。易於沉降。　　至於自覺症狀。如排尿時之尿道部微痛感。或會陰及攝護腺部之壓重或瘙癢感。或特別於排便時之攝護腺部疼痛感。又往往於射精時在攝護腺部感有劇烈之刺痛。此外性交缺乏快感。早洩。及呈疲勞，倦怠，意志悄沉之生殖器性神經衰弱症者有之。但患者毫無所覺，自以爲已至全愈狀態者亦有之。（待續）肺結核淺說（六一）  胡嘉言　　第六節　腎臟結核　　關於腎臟結核症的症象，是很難引起患者鄭重注意的。在開始的時候，幾乎是毫無表現的；有時候右腎臟部分，現不定之感覺，尿中發現蛋白，這當然是不足爲憑證的。因爲在尋常的進行性肺結核症，尿中發現蛋白的例證是很多的，如果肺部一轉愈，這種症象也可完全消失無餘的。到了腎部劇痛症象一發生，可能的程度當然是在增加了，進一步的詳細檢查手續，也知道是省不了的。這一種顯著症象，是和腎臟結石疝痛，沒有什麼差異的。尿中紅血球之證明，時爲初期症象之一；大量血液的混和，所謂血尿症象，在本症也是時常發生的，並且在血尿發生後，大半是繼續發生劇痛的。此外，若尿便困難，夜間尿量增加，要急後重，諸症象，對於本症之認識，也是不無關係的。　　關於本症尿便檢查的結果，是和膀胱炎一症無大差異的。酸性，蛋白量不甚多；沉渣中以白血球爲多，紅血球不多，圓柱發現也不很多。我們不妨大膽地說一句，就是：在尋常肺結核症患者，甚至有絕大嫌疑者，如果發生膀胱炎狀態了，那末，對於腎臟結核症的揣測，是可以鄭重成立的。至於進一步的緊要證明，自莫逾於尿中結核菌之尋得了；這是一個不很簡單的手續，但對於本症之診斷上，是含有重大意義的。止痛的醫學（廿五）  李興　　喉痛　　毒瘤的最大危險就是初期不痛不癢，患者常不注意，一等到疼痛發作了便多入於晚期挽救也多屬不易。最可痛心的事就是毒瘤晚期時明知患者要死且祗有等侯死而全世界無人能挽救。今日標準治毒瘤的方法第一就是無論何人所患何種瘤早早要找醫師認明是否毒瘤。如果證明是毒瘤務早早根本割去或外加愛克司光療或鐳錠療。萬不可遷延時日而自誤生機。　　毒瘤初期不痛不癢但到了沉重時就要日夜痛，且沉重時也完全沒有醫好希望。此時患者眞是求生不能求死不易。就是迷信盲求醫治也是徒然。此時科學醫也沒有起死回生之術，所可能做的不過代患者止痛。這種辦法不求醫好病，僅求减去患者生存期間之疼痛。這種不得已的辦法不過是實行人道主義，患者也必感恩於九泉之下。止痛最靈最靠得住的藥物是嗎啡類。須由醫師負責施行。總而言之用嗎啡是絕對爲醫治無望的人。萬不可妄用嗎啡因嗎啡除麻醉作用止痛外完全不能治好任何疾病。嗎啡雖是危險的麻醉品，用得不當實可遺害無窮而用得其當也可算是痛苦無望人的救星。用嗎啡治毒瘤確實是最下之策，注意治療毒瘤如避　洪水猛獸一樣，越早越好，卽早日醫好而不必最終採此最下之策。　　牙痛　　要明白牙爲什麼痛須明白牙齒的構造。一個牙可分爲三部分，由牙根內最中心向外第一是牙髓，中含血管與腦綫爲牙齒的生命源。痛就是由於腦綫傳遞刺激到大腦中司痛覺。牙齒中間一層是齒質。中上部最外一層是琺瑯質與堅磁相同是一種不良好的傳導體，卽冷熱與任何刺激不能傳到牙髓內之神經，故完好的牙齒不會痛。牙痛是由於外面兩層腐壞成洞穴（裕稱蛀牙）牙髓內之腦綫曝露於外。此時冷熱或任何激刺性物或發炎均可使腦腺受激刺而成牙痛。　　止牙痛有兩種辦法。一種是治標辦法，卽臨時止痛。比方一個人半夜忽然牙痛，無處可以求醫，或者爲經濟打算須等到次日寫字間時候。在這個過度疼痛時間假設沒有止通辦法就要忍受疼痛。臨時最好的止痛法就是取藥棉一小團蘸石炭酸液，後塡入痛的牙穴內。疼痛立時可以停止。此種方法祗可用於救急而不可長久用。這種止痛的神效是由於石炭酸的局部麻木腦腺作用。平常人有了牙痛總是服止痛藥片以敷衍一時。止痛藥片的作用盡是昏迷大腦而與毛病之好壞完全沒有關係——卽絕對不能治好牙痛，且久服藥片還可傷害身體，故服藥片以爲救急尙可勉强，但久服以治牙痛則不可。　　根本止牙痛法如下：腐壞牙齒洞穴如牙醫認爲可以塡補的填補，因補後牙內腦綫不受激刺就不會再痛。再假如痛牙已腐壞過甚修補無濟於事。那就祗有一樣辦法，卽援去爛牙以絕痛根。　　很多人一年喉痛好幾次，很少人一年不喉痛一次。喉痛有的輕，有的重，有的歷時久，有的歷時暫，有的有危險，有的無危險。雖然統統叫做喉痛但結果不同，原因不同，故治療也不能用一樣方法。常人於喉痛時如能自己判定是那一種喉痛，是否有危險，那樣他一定能免去很多的痛苦與很多的危險。茲分別述說各種要緊喉痛以供讀者研究。本刋代陳生白啟事七月二十三日　　本刋代陳生白啟事　七月二十三日陳君自滬南至北市，遺忘「現代花柳病學講話」第三四編原稿於三路圓路公共汽車內，現雖已將該稿重行錄就，繼續在本刋發表。但如有拾得該稿者，能寄還南市滬軍營東南醫學院內陳君收，亦所願也。另備薄酬，藉謝盛意</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言衛生局將舉辦產婦登記  夢若　　我國的嬰孩死亡率，要是有可能統計，一定可以得到一個驚人的數目。推其原因，雖很複雜。最重要者，當是一般家庭缺乏生產常識所致。最近本市衛生局，爲注意公共衛生起見，特令滬南區衛生事務所，辦理婦嬰衛生，舉行產婦登記。這對於人民是很有益的。　　我國一般婦女，除少數外，生產大都僱用舊式穩婆接生。因而產婦及嬰孩之慘遭犧牲者，不知凡幾。蓋穩婆接生，只憑一點淺薄的經騐。旣無接生技術，又乏科學知識·平產或者還能應付，一遇難產，便手足無措。至若對於產婦處置，以及嬰孩的保障，也是毫沒辦法。　　今衛生局爲安全計，擬辦理婦嬰衛生，舉行產婦登記，使避免婦嬰的犧牲。凡產婦懷孕五個月以上者，均可前往登記。當由專員指導其飮食起居的規定，及妊娠的攝生法。並定期檢查胎位有否異狀。同時對於產婦的日常動作等，皆有相當的糾正，本來一位產婦，對於產前產後，都應有充分的留意。妊娠七個月後，至少須按月一次，經產科醫生診察。產後的衛生，也很重要。故衛生　舉行產歸登記的辦法，對於保障婦嬰，的確是很妥善的。　　又衛生局近近於本埠一部分產科醫院，在各日報大登廣吿，其接生價目，標榜便宜，而一般市民之受欺騙者很多。蓋接生費雖然便宜。但除接生費而外，每多巧立名目欺騙。如產婦注射催生針，止血針，補血針，或强心針，以便從中取利。結果產婦的負担，反而加重。故將設法予以制止。這種情形，在上海很普遍，實有加以約束的必要。勒嫁捐  眞　　這名目雖然不曾列爲國家的正供項下，可是在吾鄕確是有嫁在必捐之列，因而「勒」與「嫁」也必然地合婚起來，土產的聰明才智之士，像受了上帝啟示的很明白有時非「勒」便不能收到「捐」的效果。因此—　　「婆婆！你執拗不過他的，不如順水推舟，做過人情啦！」　　由「憂」而晋級到「孤」的李太婆，聽到辛永瞎子報吿她姪子新民戶長，要嫁她的相依爲命的寡媳，爲的是要收捐，她也視爲鼻涕掉到口裏是口的外快那麽應該。　　不過，她也有點奇怪，那便是她的一生爲了人類的大事業，功非小可，但人們似乎壓根兒不曾帶着心肝來，她雖參加過生產，却不曾注意到這一點！　　特別是新民彊雜種，她是嘔盡許多心血和工夫澆在他身上的。從「發動」到「落地」，他母親足足在床上叫哭了五畫夜，她也足足地陪了五畫夜，連拉矢吃飯也沒離開他母親的床邊，臨盆的前夜他母產差一點昏死過去，而他仍橫在他母親的肚皮裏，他的父親，顫聲地哭求：　　「伯母！有什麼法子嗎？…我只求大人安全…小孩子可管不了…伯母…想個法子…」　　害一命，活一命，鄉村的助產婆雖沒懸出這條戒例，但她沒有這末殘忍，她要想出兩全的辦法，於是她使施用在新醫學上的所謂「手術」，—那時叫做「手拿了。她覺得經手的事應該做得十全十美才對得住自己，何況她是「伯母」。果然生下來啦，並且母子都安全。而她所得的報酬，也只是和他人報酬她的一樣：十個紅蛋，五尺紅布。　　就是這雜種—新民，現在二十餘歲了，他做了這一支人家的出色人物，他父親做了太老爺，把從前的一切全忘了，見子欺侮孤寡，他不說一句好話，但他母親應當知道生產的苦痛，一個救命恩人應不該這樣容易忘記的。就拿煌子，根生，若林他們來說，對她也還有幾分感情，一到年頭節尾，隨手總得送來斤把糖，或其他什麼的，看見她總是親切地喊一聲伯母，而她一瞧見他們，便會回憶到他們初到這世界上來的一切，誰是仰生，誰是仆生，誰是夢生，落地時哭聲的大小，臍帶的短長，任憑他們是頂天立地的漢子，或眉淸目秀的女郎，這些瞞不過她，於是從她心底便蕩出一絲笑意來。只是新民這雜種，她近來一瞧見便生氣，他一切瞞不過她但他却分外的神氣十足，似乎誰也摸不着他的生庚時辰。　　婆媳倆孤寂地在桌上午餐，一雙筷架在一碗叫靈飯上面，熱氣沸沸地向上幌着，李太婆一顆思兒的心，恨不能隨着飯的蒸氣呵進兒子的陰靈的口裏：媳婦吃不下飯，似乎要把她的淚水來薦靈的儘是淌，剛到中年的她的臉上，也有了好大一把皺紋；　　「媽媽，我不願意嫁人，我要留着照應你，你老人家不需要我嗎？」　　「誰不需要你！你一走，我便是一個十足的孤老！只有新民那個沒良心的就在說七說八，絕代的！我兒子還可扶起來說話，血肉還未冷，就說這些沒良心的話！」筷子一拓，碗裏湯和眼中淚一隨傾瀉出來。「就是再急些，也應當讓我兒子滿了百日……」　　「媽媽，我的命不好，我不能再去連累別人，就是討飯，我也情願跟着你老人家！」媳婦又挾了一箸靑菜送到叫靈飯，彷彿要向丈夫的陰靈呼救。　　「不過，旣無孫子又無錢，我是不好意思要你守；但也沒心要嫁你：全是新民那雜種在播弄是非，—想得錢，他是族內的長牙齒啦！假如…假如我要你嫁的話，首先會徵求你的同意……」　　「我不願意嫁誰，你要我服侍你嗎？他不是還沒滿百日嗎？—又怎麽對得住他呢！」　　屋樑上只嚓嚓地一陣老鼠跑，翻下許多掦塵如串地落到桌傍，從兒子死後，這屋子裏陽氣全消滅了，連老鼠也的晝橫行起來，像在欺侮這一對孤弱的婆媳：靈前一點棉油燈，把吹竄來的風和靜穆的空氣，也變成素悼的雰圍了，而那在竄來的風面前的一點欲明欲滅的燈，正象徵了她倆婆媳的生命！　　「你別急！萬事有我，如果……有事兒發生，我便和那雜種拚命！」　　一頓飯，便在極度陰悒的空氣下結束子。媳婦收過碗筷，又去做她的針綫，李太婆重回到蒲團上，對着那座紫竹林中的觀世音，—掛在牆上那給香火　得成了焦黃的畫幅，喃喃地禱吿起來，她要把今生的罪惡，—天折兒子的凶報，全個兒懺悔個乾凈；來世，她希望來世榮華富貴，子孫壽考；珠子兒每滑過一粒，覺得罪過也减輕了一片。　　傍晚時候，李太婆剛從山上掮了一担枯柴回來，一抵堂門，便瞧見媳婦和一個漢子在講話，她疑心媳婦了，正想來探問，不料那漢子先幾步搶到了她的面前，一面接着柴，一面問候她；　　「伯母，這大的年紀怎弄得動！有事可喊我們過來哪！」　　李太婆一看是根生，眉淸目秀的，想到同樣大小的自己的萬寳死去，便幾乎哭出來，他仍有點懹疑他的來意：「根生哥，長久不來了！今天有什麼好事？」　　「一來萬寳哥去世後，我不曾來看過你老人家：二來有一個不好的消息吿訴你，請你老人別說是我吿訴你的。」</p>

<p>根生凑到李太婆的耳邊。　　李太婆只是點着頭：「我曉得是新民那雜種，他想得錢，辛永瞎子早講過的。」　　「請你別說我講的！他知道了要報復我的。他不單是你家的紅人，並且是地方上的紅人，他要報復我們，便好像倒穀子下倉那末容易呢！」　　李太婆對這件事陡起了精神上的拘攀新民要嫁，她孤老太婆那敢說過「不」字呢？媳婦嚶嚶地抽泣，一面點起香挿上丈夫靈前的香爐。那情景把根生也刺激起一股經愁，他看見婆媳倆投入絕望的深淵中，一種深藏在少年心底的英雄氣和俠義感便浮湧上來，「伯母，我想這幾天讓萬寳嫂到別處去睡，要搶總是早晚，你預備一面鑼，你一敲，我們便趕來，——作搶犯打。另外我去和若林，煌子商量，這樣我們便有理由不怕你新民戶長的報復了。你？……」　　計劃便這樣决定下來。　　第三天早晨李太婆還在睡夢裏，她的前門便劈拍地大嚮起來。是搶親，李太婆很明白，她抱着　從門一竄出。便大敲起來，「不在，到那裏去了」？這聲音滲入她耳裏，她更發狂的敲。　　也許搶親者懾服李太婆的鑼聲，根生他們還不曾來，他們便逃跑了。她剛從後而跳到前面墩坡上，天隊人馬便從四面包來，但搶親的連影子也消滅了。她瞇着雙眼睛眏根生，若林一班人，快活得什麼似的：　　「只有你個這些種田的還有點良心，我收了一輩子的生，總沒有落空，讀書的，像新民那雜種，除開錢，再不認識什麼了，沒良心的傢伙！」公益的早晨  艾荼　　每次歸鄉的時候，給火輪或拖渡載着我的疲倦底身子，悄悄地渡過了恐懼的河灘，渡過了急流的灣面，在黑夜裏，什麼都聽不見的，只是一陣一陣颼颼底風聲跟那打動旅人底心渦的浪花在交響着。到了東方已透出了一絲的曙光，大地上一切底輪廓也從矇迷而至於淸楚地在人們底眼眶裏出現的時候，在平靜的河水面行駛着的慢速度的船隻就向着淸靜的十九世紀的西洋風味的小都市的公益的碼頭上泊去了。　　到了這個時候，在船裏的旅客們，就忽忽地洗臉，把行李收拾得淸淸楚楚地。那時，水手們也忙着的奔來走去的忙個交不開的樣子，艙裏的人們也是很吵雜地，跟那嘩啦嘩啦的江水的浪調混和了而向着靜寂的早晨的海面飄揚。　　那時，我總是擺開了行李，獨個兒在甲板上踱來踱去的或者是靠着欄桿眺望着一個淸幽的十九世紀的小市塲上的一切，一邊兒，深深地吸着新鮮的海風，海風總是帶着歡迎人家似的氣息，輕輕地飄襲着我底疲倦的心膛，每到了這樣的時候，我的腦袋總是非常淸醒而活潑的，在大都市裏所過着的不見早晨的生活的悒鬱就悄悄地溜走了。——一切新的感覺就在這樣的環境裏產生了。　　眼睛眺望着岸邊的高昂的洋房，一排一列的矗立着，那基督敎堂的高高的屋尖，在早晨的小都市裏擺出了她的高傲與矜誇似的神氣，跟那低低的中世紀式的舊房子相比着，顯現出了他們不同底風格。還有，在江岸上，那一些舖店還關着烏黑色的門。堤上的綠林樹似乎一個人初醒的時侯一樣的忸怩的態度，跟着輕飄的海風在飄揚。　　在公益隔着河的單水口的商埠却泊着許多許多的商船，那兒似乎比這一邊還要繁盛一點的在早晨裏開始囂張起來了。這兒，我就想起了小孩子的時候，伯父從美國發了財歸來的時候，在這兒建築了一家小洋房，那時還有許多洋人在這兒寄居的，所以，小小的公益已漸漸兒變成了洋化的住宅區的小都市了。　　船泊定在木架的碼頭以後，我就跟着許多旅客們忽忽地上了岸，我帶着我的小行李，穿過一些平坦的士敏土的馬路，穿過了一些靜寂的人家的鬥前，最後過了橋，就看見了一個廣大的火車工廠，那兒有着許多火車頭跟着車廂，縱橫地停在那兒。到了火車站的時候，已看見許多人在等候六點半鐘的頭次火車了，所以，月台裏的人們顯得在擾動，播送出來一陣一陣吭集的聲息。　　然而，時間還很早，那時不到六點鐘，我又跑出來，在平靜而很淸潔的街道上流浪着，吸着海風，到了一個小小的公園，在茸茸的綠草塲上散着步。可是，這兒跟鄉村不兩樣，小孩子們早已離開了家，帶着書包跑來跑去的，而且在公園裏做起玩意兒來了，那天眞而活潑的樣子給嫩紅的太陽光照耀得更加美麗而可愛的。遠遠地望着海面，也已望得見紅日的彩色了；樹梢上，高洋房的紅綠色的瓦頂，也愉快地接受了早晨的太陽的溫柔底撫愛，給我感到大地上的一切似乎是幸福而偉大似的。　　離開了市街。從大旅店或大茶樓底下經過的時候？却還是見到寂靜的。原來這兒沒有大都市上的習慣，這兒是沒有早餐或早茶喝喫的。我雖然感到肚子有點餓，也只得趕着回到車站裏，買了票子，那時火車已響着催促的調子，嗚嗚地，我才跟早晨的公益離開，跨上了車廂，而火車也帶着我向南方的家鄉迅速地拖去了。鄉戀  耳禾　　長久蟄居在鄉下，像一隻籠中的小鳥頗想在白雲天外遨遊一回了。於是我來到這個騷動的大都市。可是住不了幾個月，像懷念一個舊情人似的，我刻刻在想念着淡寞的恬靜的村居生活來了。而且這戀慕之惰愈來愈濃，濃得像一壺濃茶。　　舊歷的六月已到，在這火熱的大都市上我沒有半點的留戀，我將枓却一身埃塵回到那個爲我日夜所繫戀的鄉野去　　初來上海，還是積雪未融的時候。像關在牢籠裏似的在不知不覺中我偷偷地過了整個的春天，如今已是盛夏時份了。四五個月來我看厭了那些高大的建築，聽厭了那些騷擾的響聲。所謂「錦樣三春」，在我的確是陌生的。不但如此，連極小極小的希望，一株秀媚的春草我還不曾見過呢。　　梅雨聲中，或是向晚時份悄立在樓頭，我單單像一個跌入暮境的老者帶着落寞的情懷追憶少年的盛况似的想像着美麗的春光而已。　　然而美麗的春光已去，任你怎樣春戀，橫堅挽回不來了。維有這個盛夏的鄉村景色我還有幸福去享受。　　「離去上海」。我已下了最大的决心的。　　躺在極大的樹蔭底下，承受着一陣陣的凉風，假如高興的話，可檢點愛讀的書來讀讀。風把你的蒲葵扇吹去了。你也用不到去拾，橫堅用不到的了。疲憊的話你就可以躺下來沉沉地睡去，也許有緋色的精緻的夢呢。一覺醒來到澄淸的闊大的池裏去洗一個操，那比諸上海的什麼什麼浴室準定舒服得多多的。　　向晚時份你還可以背着手，赤着膊，靜悄悄地到園子裏去走一回。「向晚窺西圃，殘陽銜半規，無多花點綴，不少草繁滋；蘋綠鳧雛水，風輕都了枝，閒攀夜合樹，細數馬纓絲。」這許多詩材你準定可以領略到「悠悠」的境地的。　　是的，那是一個怎樣好的境地？　　晚飯過後那更好了，白天的暑氣到那時已漸漸消去，美麗的夜慕漸漸舒展開來。坐在廣塲上和人談談故事，看看高掛在天上的夏夜的月亮。沒有月亮時你可看一碧無際的藍天，或閃着銀光的星星。口渴了，你可搬出一個大西瓜來，且談且吃，那風味比諸在電風扇下吃泳淇淋並沒有什麼遜色的。再不然你索性靜悄悄的走到自己的瓜田裏去，在瓜藤上摘一個剛剛熟的，再靜悄悄的走到池邊去洗一下，於是你可以靜悄悄地吃，除了想一些淸淡的夢境外你還可以靜悄悄地聽你自己吃瓜的聲音……　　上海，畢竟使我厭膩了，每天我只在望着揚子江上的白雲，想像着白雲底下的鄉村的景色。家鄕，我在懷戀着你哪，願你平安無恙。　　「離去上海」。我已下了最大的决心的。　　別矣，上海。在絡繹聲中，在秋天的陽光下，我當再見你！播音節目彈詞　　程方舟李蓮蓀毛家書　　華美（一〇六〇）下午三時至三時三刻　　開篇「孔雀東南飛」（一）逐媳　　小吏縣中焦促卿·蘭芝妻室有賢名。十三四齡能針綫·十五六歲擅詩文。十七身爲焦姓婦。從能够。孝事堂前白髮人。仲鄕是·終日當差在衙署內。蘭芝是。鷄鳴紡織至黃昏。三日織成五疋布。還不免。惡婆啟口駡聲聲。說道。賤骨頭那配我焦家婦。仲卿不幸遇斯人。忍心腸趕她回家去。從今不許再來臨。仲卿得信歸家轉。怎忍嬌妻趕出門。告母親。莫生嗔。休把鴛鴦兩處分。孩兒命中巳祿薄。幸得賢妻慰寸心。縱有差池容易改。且恕她。年輕作事有評論。那知曉。非但不聽兒哀吿。反而駡一聲。逆母寵妻的不孝人。我看此婦無禮節。立時逐去莫留停。仲卿是。無奈哭進閨房內。脚步踉蹌神志昏。頃刻夫妻須訣別。今生難望再登門。斷腸人別斷腸人。　　歌唱　　曼社　　國華（一二〇〇）下午五時一刻至六時　　丁丁嘴太太（曼雄）微微風（曼傑）窮富姻緣（曼英）悲秋（耐雪）妹妹我怪你（曼雄）求愛秘訣（曼傑）戰地之花（曼英）你不要說不（耐雪）　　國華（一二〇〇）下午六時一刻至七時　　慢牛快馬（曼傑）我的愛人就是你（曼英）四時吟（耐雪）雙料情人（曼雄）蘇武牧羊（曼傑）今夜曲（曼英）塞外村女（耐雪）開路先鋒（曼雄）　　丁香社　　李樹德堂（九四〇）五時一刻至六時十分　　紅燒丈夫（飛莉）燕雙飛（葉英）賣花詞（葉紅）農村之歌（文璧）人面桃花（飛莉）粉紅色的夢（葉英）漁光曲（葉紅）努力（文璧）　　明遠（九六〇）下午十時至十一時　　自殺尙未成功（飛莉）慈母搖籃曲（葉紅）月下女（葉英）祝你晚安（文壁）秋夜簫聲（飛莉）蝴蝶姑娘（葉紅）新鳳陽歌（葉英）長記得（文璧）丁香社葉紅　　星星歌唱社　　新新（七八〇）下午六時至七時　　戀愛經（飛虹飛亞）體育皇后（玲琍）休息五分鐘（飛虹）花想容（白燕）靑天白日滿地紅（飛亞）摩登戀愛（白燕）給摩登小姐（玲琍）漁光曲（飛亞）　　美玲團　　李樹德（九四〇）下午六時至七時　　小桃紅（前奏曲）蝶和蜂（程英英）春潮回來吧（程瑩）甜蜜的夢（黃韻）燕燕（賴玲）秋扇明燈（黃韻）「其餘節目臨時排定」　　飛音社　　中西（一〇四〇）下午六時至七時　　拾里長亭拾杯酒（俞月明）自由之花（姚瑤）開始的一吻（姚莉）民族之光（佈德）紅顏軍士（俞月明）牧羊女（姚瑤）鴦怨（姚莉）魚兒跳（佈德）逃亡曲（賈劍鋒）　　玫瑰團　　東方（一〇二〇）下午六時十分至七時　　旱天雷（前奏）休息五分鐘（吳芳）漁光曲（張如）搖籃曲（玲玲）牧羊（曼麗）等一等吧（周恭文仙）快車（張如）吹泡泡（玲玲）　　市音（一三四〇）下午八時一刻至九時　　到春來（前奏）離別了姑娘（文仙）自由之花（吳芳）小胖子（張如）賣油條（玲玲）可愛的春天（吳芳）大路（全體）謝謝你口香糖（張　如）　　利利（一二四〇）下午十時十分至十一時　　走馬英雄（前奏）天倫之愛（張如）人間仙子（文仙）紫羅蘭（吳芳）十里長亭（曼麗）春朝曲（吳芳）蝴蝶姑娘（玲玲）努力（張如）　　星光社　　富星（九二〇）下午六時三刻至七時半　　特別快車（周璐）快樂家庭（胡瑛）賣花詞（黃喋）蘇三不要哭（競芳）愛的花（周璐）飄泊者（競芳）說愛就愛（喋瑛）長記得（黃喋）　　上海歌劇社　　新新（七八〇）下午七時至八時　　紅豆新詩（嚴華）不如歸去（嚴斐）銀色凄凉（徐健）吿別南洋（周璇）人間仙子（徐健）花生米（周璐）祝你晚安（嚴華）賣花詞（嚴斐）春歸去（新歌介紹）  楊曾恕作　　一夜的狂風暴雨，摧殘了紅花幾許，枝頭上無賴的杜宇高呌春歸去，春歸去，爲甚不帶春愁去？惱人的心事如亂絮，媽媽面前羞啟齒，就是向她訴說，恐也難……（白）呌我怎樣……啊，……天啊！……一寸情天留缺陷，料將身化石都難補情天。播音消息　　准於八月一日出版之歌星畫報，今日又有特別節目在南京路永生電臺（一〇八〇）播送，計下午二時一刻爲星星社歌唱，下午六時爲葉一好話劇（廬山眞面目），各界聽衆幸請注意，該書定價大洋二角，特價八折，預約地點；老西門東新書局，如蒙函約，請附郵票一角六分寄老西鬥唐家灣厚德里口一四八號歌星畫報社收。電影消息中華碎錦　　後起之秀中華影業公司，處女作全部有聲對白歌唱片「水國春秋」外景隊，已於二十四日到達目的地河南開封，者番至少有十五萬人參　　在藝華的「飛花村」一鳴驚人，在聯華的「新女性」更見進步，而有東方秀蘭鄧波兒之雅號的小童星陳娟娟，今在中華的「水國春秋」裏，將欲以一位天眞爛漫的鄕村少女的姿態與觀衆相見。　　「水國春秋」尙有一童星名劉犁，他在藝華的「暴風雨」中有很卓越的成績，並有東方賈克古柏的雅號，　　中華新星趙珍妮，是一位運動家，同時是一位游泳健將，今在「水國春秋」裏飾一個體格健美的鄕下姑娘。　　「水國春秋」攝影是老牌攝影師石世磐。聯華新片陣容　　二十四年度下季聯華新片陣容露佈：　　「小天使」——吳永剛編導，王人美，葛佐治，林楚楚，湯天繡，劉瓊，唐根寳合演。　　「四姊妹」——楊小仲編導，梁賽珍，梁賽珠，梁賽珊，梁賽瑚，韓蘭根，蔣君超，顧夢鶴合演。　　「寒江落雁」——馬徐維邦編導，陳燕燕，貂斑華，羅朋，馬徐維邦，洪警鈴，黃筠貞，李君磬合演。　　「天倫」——費穆導演，鍾石根編劇，時覺非，尙冠武，林楚楚，張翼，黎灼灼，陳燕燕，黎鏗，鄭君里，梅琳，貂斑華，洪警鈴，顧夢鶴合演。　　「浪

<h3 id="e1">Disaster on the Jiaoji Railway Express - Bandits Destroy Tracks West of Nanliu Station, Causing Derailment and Injuries; Suspected Bandits Fired Shots and Fled, Seemingly Prepared <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Jinan) At 1:20 AM this morning, the special express train No. 1 on the Jiaoji Railway, traveling from Qingdao to Jinan, derailed six li west of Nanliuji Station in Weixian County. A total of one guard car, one refrigerated car, and one locomotive, along with two third-class carriages, were derailed. The driver sustained minor injuries, the fireman's leg was injured, and one passenger suffered a head wound. All others were unharmed. The train and tracks were damaged. The cause is unknown. Special express train No. 2 from Jinan to Qingdao arrived at the station, switched to become No. 1 heading west, and was delayed in reaching Jinan by eight hours. No. 1 became No. 2 returning to Qingdao. Traffic is expected to be restored tonight. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) On the night of the 27th, five or six bandits dismantled five sections of the railway tracks between Nanliu and Hama Village on the Jiaoji Railway, intending to derail the No. 1 train for robbery. However, after the train passed Huangqibao Station, it stopped for tens of minutes for axle repairs. The bandits suspected that the railway authorities had been alerted and that the garrison troops at Huangqibao had boarded the train. At 2:00 AM this morning, when the train reached the west of Nanliu, it derailed and the lights went out. The bandits fired shots and shouted for surrender, but received no response. Growing more suspicious, they dispersed. Passengers experienced a great fright. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) At 9:40 PM on the 27th, the westbound express train No. 1 on the Jiaoji Railway derailed between Huangqibao and Nanliu stations. The train first overturned, followed by the guard car, refrigerated car, security car, and two third-class carriages. The driver and fireman were both seriously injured, and one passenger sustained minor injuries. According to reports, the incident was caused by bandits plotting to rob the train by dismantling the tracks in advance. However, due to the train's delay, they suspected the railway authorities were prepared and did not proceed with the robbery, only firing a few shots before fleeing. A bullet pierced the door next to a second-class sleeper car, but the passengers were safe and their belongings undamaged. Passengers from various trains walked at the accident site and exchanged trains to return. No. 2 train arrived in Qingdao at 8:40 PM. Police Chief Dai Shi Han led a company to investigate the truth on the night of the 28th. The dismantled tracks are expected to be repaired by the 29th. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) An Anhui bandit gang, pursued by floodwaters and suppression troops, infiltrated Shandong. The Jiaoji Railway was on high alert. Suddenly, at 9:40 PM last night, the special express train that departed from Qingdao at 1:30 AM this morning, while heading from Nanliu Station towards Hama Village, suddenly had its locomotive and two carriages derail and overturn immediately. This was a bandit robbery plan. At that moment, over a dozen bandits jumped out of the sorghum fields and launched an attack. Fortunately, the railway security team acted swiftly and repelled the bandits. No passengers were harmed, but two train employees were injured in the derailment.

<h3 id="e2">Jiang and Zhang Have Telegraphed Nanjing for Prompt Allocation of Relief Funds <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Hankou) Based on a telegram from Zhang Qun, Jiang telegraphed the central government requesting an initial allocation of 5 million to relieve the Hubei disaster. On the 28th, he replied by telegram, stating that he had also telegraphed the Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, and Relief Commission, urging them to expedite the allocation and provide strong support. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The disaster situation in Hubei province is extremely severe. Zhang Qun has repeatedly telegraphed the central government, requesting an initial allocation of 5 million yuan to save the survivors. To date, there has been no response. As the disaster victims await relief, time is of the essence. On the 27th, Zhang sent a special telegram to Chairman Lin, requesting that he forward it to the Executive Yuan, urging them to take charge. The original telegram reads: "Chairman Lin of Guling, respected Sir, Hubei Province, bordering the Yangtze and Han Rivers, has long been known as a 'land of lakes.' Since the beginning of summer this year, continuous rain has caused mountain floods to erupt, and the Yangtze and Han Rivers have risen simultaneously. The water level is high, and the intensity of the flood is unprecedented. Where the floodwaters have reached, counties and cities have been turned into ruins. According to reports, a total of 49 counties have been affected, with the flooded area accounting for over two-thirds of the province. In terms of material losses, all areas that produce rice, cotton, and prosperous industry and commerce have been completely destroyed, an amount that is incalculable. Those people who have died are gone, but those who have survived lack food to eat and houses to live in. Drifting in foreign lands, they will soon die as well. How can their lives be extended? How can their livelihoods be restored? This is the greatest problem facing us today. I have discussed with the Provincial Flood Relief Association to handle emergency relief, agricultural relief, and industrial relief in phases, estimating a need for approximately 12 million yuan. Since the flood of the 20th year of the Republic, Hubei province has not recovered its vitality, compounded by bandit disasters in recent years and drought last year. The treasury is empty, and the people's resources are exhausted. Although we have raised funds from various sources, the actual effect is extremely limited. We must rely on the central government to quickly allocate a large sum of money to save these survivors. Previously, because Your Excellency was avoiding the summer heat in Guling, I did not want to trouble your ears with disaster reports, but I have repeatedly telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the relevant ministries, fully describing the disaster situation and urging them to first allocate 5 million yuan to alleviate this emergency. There has been no response to date. Looking at the disaster victims eagerly awaiting relief, their expectations cannot be delayed. I implore Your Excellency to quickly telegraph the Executive Yuan and the relevant ministries, urging them to take charge so that benevolence can be applied early, saving many lives. I respectfully lead the disaster victims in bowing a hundred times." Zhang Qun, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, respectfully and gratefully sealed.

<h3 id="e6">Xu Shiying Arrives in Nanjing to Report on Disaster Inspection Trip; Vast Floods Affect Over Ten Million Victims; Over 100,000 Square Li of Land Submerged; Public and Private Losses Exceed 500 Million Yuan <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Relief Commissioner Xu Shiying arrived in Nanjing on the Jianguo steamer after inspecting the disaster situation in Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui. Xu said that he departed from Shanghai on the 15th of this month to inspect the floods in various provinces. Local authorities provided all conveniences. During the brief two-week trip, he saw the floods in Jingzhou, Shashi, Xiangfan, and Wuhan in Hubei; Xiangjiang, Zishui, and Dongting Lake in Hunan; Xiushui, Ganjiang, and Poyang Lake in Jiangxi; and Wuhu, Anqing, Huayang, and Maha Dike in Anhui. The floods were vast, and people and livestock were drifting. Over ten million victims were affected, and over 100,000 square kilometers of land were submerged. Public and private losses exceeded 500 million yuan. Seeing the victims tied together and floating or climbing to high places and calling for help, even without official responsibilities, one cannot help but feel deep sorrow. The disaster situation in the provinces along the Yangtze River is most severe in Hubei, far exceeding the situation in the 20th year of the Republic. In Hunan, over ten counties, including Yuanjiang, Yiyang, and Hanshou along the lake, had major dike breaches. In Cili, Shimen, and Lixian in western Hunan, flash floods arrived with water heads reaching several zhang. The disaster situation was also very serious. In Jiangxi, the water levels in Pingjiang, Xiushui, and Poshui all rose, and Poyang Lake could not discharge the water in time, causing a major disaster along the lake. The losses in Xinjian, Yongxiu, Poyang, Wu Ning, and Xiushui counties were enormous. Anhui Province deliberately breached 78 dikes of varying sizes and suffered less damage than the other provinces. Because of this, Anhui was still able to harvest agricultural products. Hubei, in particular, was once wealthy, but now its fields are completely submerged, and there is no prospect of replanting. This has a significant impact on the national economy, national health, and the future. This year's water level is higher than in the 20th year of the Republic. All military and political authorities, soldiers, and civilians have worked hard to rescue and prevent flooding. His inspection report is being compiled, and relief measures are being drafted. They will be submitted to the Executive Yuan in two or three days and may be released. The principles are emergency relief, industrial relief, and agricultural relief, with the central government and local governments advancing together. The country's financial resources do not seem as good as before. The government should do its best to raise funds, and he hopes that compatriots outside the disaster areas, in the midst of extreme social and economic exhaustion, will save on food and clothing and work hard to help, opening a path to survival for the disaster victims and preserving a portion of the country's vitality. Since Yu the Great, our country has never thoroughly controlled water. In recent decades, human efforts have been neglected, the riverbeds have become higher, the lakes have become shallower, and the canals and ditches of the people have been silted up. Therefore, when there is a little more rain, it is difficult to discharge, and a huge flood immediately occurs. When there is less rain, there is no water for storage, and irrigation cannot be obtained, resulting in drought. "Five years and four famines" is alarming. This year, the situation along the Yangtze River is as described above, and the Yellow River has also caused a major disaster, consuming most of the country's capabilities and financial resources. He believes that it is appropriate to raise a large sum of money to completely organize the Huai River, Han River, and local water conservancy, in order to achieve a permanent solution. In the 19th year of the Republic, he submitted a proposal, which he now feels is even more necessary. If this proposal is adopted, a century-long plan will be decided early. He hopes that the people and water conservancy experts of the country will study and publish their great ideas. Xu recently discussed relief matters with the central authorities in Nanjing and attended the founding meeting of the Central Relief Reserve Fund Management Committee. Afterwards, he went to Shanghai to jointly launch a charity drive with various dignitaries. Shandong Chairman Han and the Henan Relief Association have repeatedly invited Xu to inspect. He will continue to inspect the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan in early next month to plan comprehensively. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Wuhu) Xu Shiying arrived in Wuhu on the Jianguo steamer from Xunyang on the afternoon of the 28th. Officials and gentry from all walks of life boarded the ship to meet and discuss the disaster situation in southern Anhui and requested the allocation of funds for emergency relief. Xu told reporters that the disaster situation was most tragic in Shashi and Tianmen. In recent years, the areas along the river have suffered from four floods and droughts, a catastrophe unseen in hundreds of years. The disaster area in Anhui Province includes 13 counties, with 78 dikes of varying sizes breached, 400,000 mu of farmland submerged, and losses estimated at 6 million yuan, affecting approximately 300,000 victims. When passing through Anqing, Liu Zhenhua requested an initial allocation of 800,000 yuan to handle emergency relief and industrial relief. Xu took the original steamer to Nanjing at 3:00 PM.

The entire dike has a total of 2,200 protection laborers, guarding day and night and rushing to the dike in case of emergency. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A telephone call from Baoding stated that Changyuan County Chief Zhang Qinglu telegraphed the province, stating that the Yellow River flow is still strong, the current is rapid, and dangerous conditions are continuous. They are desperately protecting the dike day and night. The official dike behind the office is being scoured by the side flow, with many collapsed areas. The Fuzhai Zhuang Dike in the first section has collapsed and they are rushing to block it with materials overnight. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A telephone call from Baoding stated that Hebei River Affairs Bureau Director Qi Shouan telegraphed the province on the 27th, stating that the Yellow River flow is still unusually turbulent due to heavy rain in the upper reaches, and a crisis is imminent. They are still rushing to protect it day and night. The Xiashijie in Guanting Hou was scoured and destroyed on the 23rd and was stabilized by rushing to build protective dams. Since the night of the 25th, the water level at the old dam has dropped by 6 cm, but the main flow is directly impacting the dike, and the scouring of the dike has not diminished. The new compartments before and after Guanting are all moving, sinking by one or two cun. The movement of the dams and weirs in the Shiche section is even more severe. The 7th, 8th, and 9th weirs are all collapsing and are being rushed for protection by a part of the staff. (28th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e12">News from Beijing News Association: Request for Reconsideration of Publication Law; Petition to the Central Political Council for Redetermining Principles and Nationwide Telegram Advocating Consistent Stance <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Nanjing News Association issued a telegram on the 28th regarding the Publication Law. The original telegram stated: "Please forward to all newspapers, news agencies, and the publishing industry nationwide for consideration. The Legislative Yuan passed amendments to the Publication Law on the 12th of this month. The content is difficult to implement. The news industry in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places has consistently advocated urging the Central Political Council to redetermine principles and submit them to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration. This concerns the future of national culture and is a matter of urgency. In addition to sending representatives to petition the Central Political Council and the Legislative Yuan and submitting a petition, this association is sending telegrams nationwide, advocating a consistent stance in order to achieve thorough implementation. The full text of the petition to the Central Political Council today, along with a separate telegram, is attached for your perusal. Nanjing News Association respectfully. The attached petition is as follows: Regarding the recent amendments to the Publication Law passed by the Legislative Yuan, the content is quite difficult to implement, requesting the redetermination of principles and submission for reconsideration. It is believed that speech and thought are the source of promoting civilization and progress. Since the founding of the Republic of China and the renewal of the national system, the contribution of the press in supporting and promoting this cannot be ignored. However, in recent years, the country has faced many difficulties, and the world has been unstable. World trends of thought have changed dramatically. In Europe and the United States, the 19th century is regarded as the golden age of Yao and Shun, and in our country, the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic are seen as something infinitely distant. However, the entire publishing industry of our country has assessed the relative importance of collective and individual interests, not hesitating to sacrifice small personal interests to promote the greater public good. Since the promulgation of the Publication Law in December 1920, although some of the articles have been deeply felt to be inconvenient, for several years we have恪守功令and have not failed in our duties. It is found that the amendments to the Publication Law passed by the Legislative Yuan this time have neither corrected the inconveniences to the publishing industry nor further increased its difficulties. The signatories are involved in the publishing business, and their interests are closely linked. Fortunately, this law has not yet been promulgated. Dare to list the most important points on the left for your consideration: (1) The current laws and regulations of the competent authorities of the publishing industry stipulate that they are the provincial governments or the municipal governments under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan where they are located. However, this amendment changes them to the county governments or the social bureaus of the municipal governments under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan. Their powers are also expanded to include detention and punishment. The examination and judgment of the content of publications are matters of specialized knowledge, and it is especially necessary to be in a detached position so that facilities can be expected to be fair. If the fate of local publications is determined by the local government, how many publications can survive? Even if there are those who are able to win the favor of the local government, what is the value of such publications? Moreover, local publications often target local government agencies in their news reports and commentaries. Granting this power to local government agencies to restrict them will inevitably lead to disputes and abuse. The signatories believe that the council should redetermine the principles and submit them to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration. This is the first point. (2) Article 14 of the current law and the same article in the amendment both stipulate that "corrections" or "rebuttals" should be published in full and that their position should be equivalent to the original text. Over the years, the publishing industry has found this article the most difficult to deal with in practice, especially for newspapers. According to the usual practice, newspapers always comply with requests for corrections from the person or persons related to the news being published. However, the rebuttals often fill pages and are dozens of times longer than the original news. If newspapers are required to publish them in full and are also required to publish them in a position equivalent to the original text, then newspapers will be filled with "corrections" and "rebuttals" and will not be able to fulfill their original function. This is the greatest inconvenience that the newspaper industry has felt over the years. If the amendment remains the same, cunning people will take advantage of it to exert their poison. This is not related to the government's fundamental purpose of controlling culture, and the publishing industry will suffer even more. The signatories believe that the council should redetermine the principles and submit them to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration. This is the second point. (3) Article 20 of the current law states that "publications shall not publish debates on litigation cases that are prohibited from being made public." The amendment adds a second paragraph, "No criticism shall be made of litigation cases until after a judgment has been made." The intention is to respect the independence of judicial decisions. Who knows that the interpretation of judicial independence is to be free from the interference of administrative or military power. If the expression of public opinion and clear opinion is enough to assist judges in what they cannot reach, and the Senate and House of Representatives can adopt the subtle meaning of the Anglo-American jury system in legal precedents, given the current state of the judicial community in our country and the corruption of judicial education, it must be said that judges are born with sacred wisdom and that public opinion is like dung and urine. Is this not a blessing for the country, and how can it contribute to the dignity of the judiciary? The intention of the amendment only knows one thing but does not know the other. The signatories believe that the council should redetermine the principles and submit them to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration. This is the third point. (4) The amendment adds a new Article 21: "No publication shall be made of personal or family privacy." It is a fundamental principle of public morality in our society to conceal evil and promote good. However, to hate evil is to promote good, and to eliminate turbidness is to promote clarity. Personal privacy only concerns oneself. If newspapers promote it, it is of course boring. If the matter or the person is sufficient to affect the public interest of society, and the law has not yet sanctioned it, newspapers "shall make appropriate comments and records in good faith on matters that are subject to public comment." If this is still not allowed, is it not the intention of Article 2, Section 2, of the amended Publication Law to provide advance protection for traitors? Therefore, the non-approval of the publication of personal family privacy must be subject to conditions. The signatories believe that the council should redetermine the principles and submit them to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration. This is the fourth point. (5) The current law and the amendment regarding the chapter on administrative sanctions generally ignore the right of appeal of the sanctioned party. The amendment changes the competent authority to the county government or the social bureau of the municipal government directly under the Executive Yuan in the locality, and the exercise of sanctions is of course more direct and rapid. However, the suffering of the sanctioned person will be deepened. If it is said that the impropriety of the administrative sanctions should be appealed through the ordinary administrative appeal procedure, then the severity of the publishing sanctions is so severe, and the slowness of the appeal procedure is so slow, I am afraid that it is not a matter of fairness. Moreover, the amendment does not have any explicit provisions to remedy this. The signatories believe that the council should redetermine the principles and submit them to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration. This is the fifth point. Other matters such as the inspection system, the current law, and the amendment only have provisions on books and other publications. There is not a single word mentioned in the chapter on newspapers and magazines. Those who operate newspapers have nothing to abide by, and those in power will inevitably feel that there is no standard and feel thorny. The plight of the superiors and subordinates is like this. The above five points and the last meaning concern the future of the national culture. The signatories are witnessing a major disaster coming, and the righteousness is declining day by day. They dare to express their views in a presumptuous manner. They respectfully request the council to quickly redetermine the principles and submit them to the court for reconsideration in order to meet the expectations of the public and benefit the people's wisdom. An urgent statement, the Nanjing News Association. (Central News Agency telegram on the 28th)</p>

<h3 id="e14">The Impact of Japan's Expansion of Armaments <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Under the slogan of "national defense first," the Japanese military authorities are committed to expanding their armaments program beyond the limits of their finances. The country's financial resources are being depleted as a result, and the budget deficit is irremediable. The government is thus forced to issue public bonds excessively. Finance Minister Takahashi believes that the amount of public bonds has already reached the point of saturation and that further issuance would plunge the country into bankruptcy. He issued a statement yesterday, bitterly describing the harm and implying a warning to the military. The Japanese public has largely supported this view, and the Minsei Party has strongly defended Takahashi's position. This proves that the impact of the expansion of armaments on the country's foundation has already been deeply recognized by the general public in Japan.</p>
<p>Japan's excessive expansion of its armaments in recent years has been justified by the need to cope with the international crisis. However, this imaginary crisis, once analyzed, can be seen to have been entirely created by Japan's own East Asian policy, which goes beyond the scope of justice. Japan's ambition to monopolize East Asia and exclude the power of other countries is clear. Countries with relevant interests have no choice but to prepare for defense in the Pacific. This is what the Japanese military authorities have cited as a pretext for expanding their armaments in order to seek the understanding of the people.</p>
<p>Even if the powers in the Pacific have a concrete policy towards Japan, it is only for the purpose of defense. Those who study international affairs are well aware of this. The Soviet Union is advocating world peace and has already made various concessions to Japan in fact. The United Kingdom is dealing with its own territories and European disputes, which are still thorny. It is obviously unable to reach the Far East. Even the United States, which regards Japan as its only psychological enemy, has been deeply affected by the recession and is painfully aware of the serious damage caused by international wars. Under circumstances that are tolerable, it is determined not to provoke Japan's displeasure. This has been particularly evident in recent years under President Roosevelt. Since Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, the United States has not lodged any diplomatic protests against Japan's aggressive actions in China. In May of this year, the United States conducted naval exercises in the Pacific and sent two special envoys of goodwill to Japan to improve relations. Now, Roosevelt has reiterated his good neighbor policy. It can be seen that the United States is not without compromise towards Japan. According to recent foreign dispatches, the United States is preparing to abandon the undefended clause in the Washington Treaty and to set up defenses in the Aleutian Islands, Guam, and other Pacific islands. Although this seems to be an irritating intention towards Japan, its nature is only limited to defending its own territory.</p>
<p>From the above, it can be seen that the key to whether a Pacific crisis can be avoided lies entirely with Japan. If Japan, in view of the harmfulness and uselessness of the international arms race, makes reasonable amendments to its established East Asian policy so that it does not incur the jealousy of other powers, then there is no possibility of disrupting peace in the Pacific. This should also be understood by the general public in Japan. However, the Japanese military is now infatuated with the victories of the past Russo-Japanese and Sino-Japanese wars and longs for the dream of dominating East Asia. How difficult it is to expect them to abandon their traditional policies for the sake of international peace.</p>

<p>Silver experts here said today that they had not heard of Italy's intention to purchase silver in London. However, since the Italian government recalled silver coins, a small amount of silver worth about £15,000 has been shipped to Italy in recent weeks. They also believe that Italy may eventually sell silver to purchase silver and other war supplies abroad. (National News Agency telegram on the 27th)</p>
<h3 id="e16">On the Eve of the League of Nations Meeting; Italian Foreign Minister Sends Note of Warning; Opposes Expanding the Scope of Discussion; Limited to Mediation Procedures <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) Italian Foreign Minister Mussolini sent a note to the League of Nations today, indirectly warning that if the Executive Council does not limit the scope of its discussion and refers to matters other than the Italian-Ethiopian border dispute, Italy will consider withdrawing from the League of Nations. The note has been published by the Secretariat of the League of Nations today. It also stated that Italy is very willing to peacefully resolve the original dispute. At the same time, the Ethiopian King announced in the Ethiopian capital that Ethiopia is now awaiting the decision of the Executive Council. (National News Agency telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Italian government submitted a memorandum to the League of Nations today, stating that it is willing to participate in the extraordinary meeting of the Executive Council on July 31, but with the condition that the scope of discussion of the Executive Council should be limited to considering various effective measures to enable the Italian-Ethiopian Mixed Arbitration Committee to continue its work. If some countries attempt to raise other issues, Italy will reserve its attitude. The Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Avenol, has forwarded the Italian memorandum to all members of the Executive Council and the Ethiopian government and replied to Italy, stating that this memorandum will be included in the agenda. If Ethiopia has any opinions on this matter, they will also be forwarded. From this perspective, the first step of the Executive Council after the meeting will be to consider the reservations put forward by Italy. (Havas telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Italian Foreign Minister Mussolini replied to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Avenol, stating that if the meeting of the Executive Council of the League of Nations on July 31 to discuss the Italian-Ethiopian dispute is limited to continuing mediation procedures and does not involve the overall issue, Italy can participate in the meeting. The Italian Foreign Minister's reply recalled past events, stating that Italy reiterated its willingness to continue the work of the mediation and arbitration committee to deal with border matters in two notes to Ethiopia on July 14 and July 23. However, the discussions should not go beyond the scope of the compromise solution agreed upon by both parties. Both notes inquired whether Ethiopia was prepared to instruct its representatives in the Mediation Committee to abide by the obligations undertaken by the compromise solution. When the formal views of Ethiopia are officially known, Italy's participation in the meeting of the Executive Council of the League of Nations should not be difficult. Italy believes that in the current situation, the meeting of the League of Nations can have no other purpose than to study the best way to restore the work of the Mediation Committee. However, if this cannot be achieved, Italy reserves the right to declare its views. (Reuters telegram on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) People here now feel that the nature of the Italian telegram is close to a letter of mourning, and because it is personally signed by Mussolini, it has increased the relationship. Most countries have not sent their foreign ministers to attend this executive meeting, which is particularly noteworthy. All the small countries clearly feel that the three countries of England, France, and Italy have always done their best and have no intention of shirking their responsibility.

<p>(London) It is learned that because Italy has rejected economic benefits to avoid war against Ethiopia, Britain will, at the meeting of the Executive Council of the League of Nations on Wednesday, request that the League of Nations宁以气壮而死, 勿以气馁图生. If there are no special diplomatic changes in the next day or two, the British Minister for War Affairs, Eden, will ask Italy to submit the entire issue of dissatisfaction with Ethiopia to the League of Nations. If Italy does not agree, Eden will insist that the League of Nations investigate the entire dispute, regardless of the outcome. According to the original intention of the League of Nations, it wanted to ostensibly take care of Ethiopia and actually please Italy. Now that Italy has rejected Britain's proposal, Britain will make this request. However, if Italy is willing to hand over the entire issue to the League of Nations, it is said that all countries will also try to make Italy's actions reasonable, and after the entire issue is raised, the League of Nations will have no choice but to investigate Ethiopia's international status. Therefore, any resolution will be postponed. (National News Agency telegram on the 27th)</p>

<p>(Paris) "Le Temps" recently commented on the attitude of various countries towards the Italian-Ethiopian dispute, saying, "Italy's attitude may be hesitant and uncertain, but we still believe that it will definitely participate in the extraordinary meeting of the Executive Council, but with the condition that the scope of discussion of the extraordinary meeting should be limited to the resolution of the Executive Council on May 25. In other words, the agenda should not be expanded and the entire Italian-Ethiopian dispute should be studied. The Italian-Ethiopian Mixed Arbitration Committee failed to reach a compromise due to differences of opinion. At this time, a neutral fifth arbitrator should be added. Although this is not something that the Executive Council should do, it would be better for the Executive Council to persuade the parties to agree to appoint one. Then, the arbitration procedure can continue automatically, and the Executive Council must wait until the arbitration procedure is extended to August 25 and still fails to reach a definite solution before it can comprehensively study the Italian-Ethiopian dispute. The Italian-Ethiopian dispute has reached this point. We must not make any mistakes in strategy or in sequence, otherwise the League of Nations will suffer serious consequences. How can we not carefully consider the matter?" (Havas telegram on the 27th)</p>

During the Italian-Ethiopian War in 1896, Taytu held great power several times, personally managed state affairs, and was especially able to use her talents among the generals and distribute the troops under her command to appropriate locations, carefully considering the best solution.

<p>(New York) Soviet hero Levanevsky's upcoming flight from Moscow via the Arctic to San Francisco has attracted special attention from the American aviation community. American renowned pilot Panben told the "Pravda" correspondent that Li's flight can be guaranteed to succeed, and said, "We admire the Soviet Union's aviation. In recent years, Soviet aviation has leaped forward. Now its aircraft manufacturing technology and driving work have both reached the same level as the United States, and its broad public participation in flight exceeds the United States. Taking parachute jumping as an example, it is still a matter of entertaining the audience and the number of techniques is extremely small. There is one thing that the Soviet Union can boast to the world, that is, the government's support and encouragement for the Moscow-San Francisco flight. This flight is the most courageous attempt in the aviation world." American renowned Arctic explorer Stefansson also told the "Pravda" correspondent about the flight to the Soviet government bulletin, saying, "If this flight is successful, it will be the greatest flight in aviation history. The Moscow-San Francisco route is not only shorter but also safer than other routes. I believe this flight can be successful because I deeply believe in Mr. Levanevsky's experience and because his companions are assisted by the Soviet Union's outstanding aviation organization and Professor Schmidt's rich knowledge of the Arctic." The chairman of the Royal Geographical Society of England, Cookes, told the "Pravda" correspondent that he believes that Levanevsky's upcoming flight is the most courageous attempt, which will break all records, and said, "The valuable new experience gained from the results of this flight will make the scientific content richer."

<p>Turin, Italy A powder factory in Taino, Italy, suddenly exploded today, completely destroying the factory. The surrounding area felt the shock for miles. It is now known that 32 people have died, including 25 girls, and there are many injured, 20 of whom are seriously injured and have been sent to the hospital. Most of them are unlikely to be saved. Soldiers and Blackshirts are trying to search for the dead and injured in the rubble where the embers have not been extinguished, but they are greatly hampered by the pungent fumes. The accident started in the hand grenade and fuse installation room. The explosion was so violent that glass windows were shattered for miles. Factory debris and the remains of the victims were scattered far and wide. The cause of the accident is currently unknown. (Reuters telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>Valetto City, Italy Regarding the explosion at the Taino explosives factory, according to the latest news, the number of deaths has reached more than fifty, and dozens of people have been seriously injured. The factory was opened by the Italian Explosives General Company, and the company is affiliated with the Mondecatini Chemical Company. The total number of workers is 500. The factory is located on a small hill, only one kilometer away from the town of Taino and not far from Lake Maggiore. The explosion occurred at 2:35 p.m. yesterday. After the incident, officials sent people to rescue and clean up the rubble. A total of twelve corpses were found in the evening. The flesh and blood were blurred and the scene was horrible. Late at night, work was suspended for fear of further explosions and will be continued at dawn. It is now known that the explosion occurred in the packing area of the factory. It is rumored that the cause of the explosion was due to a box of explosives falling to the ground, but this has not yet been confirmed. (Havas telegram on the 28th)</p>

<p>(New York) This morning, before the German ship "Bremen" set sail for Europe, a communist demonstration occurred. Tonight, communists clashed with police in the streets, resulting in a fierce hand-to-hand combat for a long time. Many nearby residents were awakened from their dreams by the clamor and, wearing their robes, leaned on the windows to watch. They threw brushes, shoes, buckets, and cans at the combatants and poured dirty water on them. Later, police reinforcements arrived and dispersed the demonstrators with wooden clubs. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>(Washington) As the German postal ship "Bremen" was setting sail yesterday, suddenly over a thousand communists held an anti-National Socialist demonstration and tore down the German flag. Assistant Secretary of State Carr expressed regret over this matter but stated that unless someone formally brought it to the attention of the State Department, the State Department did not intend to take any formal action. Furthermore, a certain German resident of New York recently applied to Mayor LaGuardia for a business license. The mayor, citing the discriminatory treatment of Jews within Germany as a reason, refused to issue it. Subsequently, the German intelligence agency issued a public statement, stating that the New York mayor's action was a violation of the German-American commercial treaty. State Department officials made no comment on this matter. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>(New York) When the German postal ship "Bremen" set sail from here yesterday, suddenly communists held an anti-National Socialist demonstration and tore down the German flag. The police department, fearing that similar incidents would follow, plans to take special measures to prevent them. Two other German postal ships, the "Deutschland" and the "Europa," are scheduled to set sail for Europe next Wednesday and Friday. In addition, the Italian postal ship "Rex" is scheduled to set sail next Saturday. People are concerned that when the Italian postal ship sails, someone will come out in opposition to that country's policies in Abyssinia and hold a demonstration. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The incident of the German postal ship "Bremen" having its German flag seized by American communists and thrown into the river when it departed from New York has aroused anger among all Germans. They all say that if this had happened in Germany and the insulted party was another country, what would that country think? All newspapers have commented on this incident. The Deutsche Tageszeitung said that tearing down another country's flag is one of the most serious acts of insult under international law. How can Germans not be greatly angered by this unfortunate incident involving the German flag in New York? The occurrence of this matter is happening on the same date as the Third International Conference in Moscow. Moreover, the Communist Party's attack on the German postal ship and the tearing down of the German flag clearly shows a pre-planned scheme. It is regrettable that the local police neither prevented it beforehand nor stopped it afterward. The occurrence of this unfortunate incident is due to the New York newspapers constantly reporting terrifying news that is enough to arouse American resentment. We hope that those who want good relations between the two countries will correct this. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>

<h3 id="e28">Military Spending Swells, Making Japan's Budget Difficult to Compile, Military Unhappy with Public Debt Policy <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) In the next year's budget, the swelling of military spending seems inevitable, so it is generally expected that compilation difficulties will be similar to this year. The government has long been extremely anxious about breaking through these difficulties. The guidelines for the next year's budget compilation decided by the Cabinet and the content of the public debt policy announced by Finance Minister Takahashi on the 26th are both ambush lines for the government in its difficult compilation situation. This is the general observation. The government wants to rationalize the methods of finalizing the budget and attempt to compile the next year's budget smoothly. The budget has always been negotiated by the officials of the various ministries and the officials of the Ministry of Finance, completely in a laissez-faire manner. As a result of mutual grinding, the ministers finally use political solutions at the Cabinet meeting to get out of the difficulties. However, this method only seeks concessions and compromises from the ministers concerned, and it often contains the danger of the collapse of the Cabinet. Moreover, it is doubtful whether the Okada Cabinet, like Finance Minister Takahashi's old age, can stay in the final budget Cabinet meeting and breathe its tense air. Therefore, the government's compilation of the next year's budget will not only be entrusted to the negotiations between the officials, but also Finance Minister Takahashi and the Cabinet members will negotiate repeatedly. In addition, the Cabinet Investigation Bureau will also be mobilized to rationalize the budget compilation and overcome its difficulties. (United Press, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Finance Minister Takahashi once stated that if deficit public bonds continue to be issued without limit to compensate for revenue shortfalls, it will leave behind major disasters in the future. Therefore, he issued a statement on public bonds again. However, the Army authorities expressed dissatisfaction with this statement, believing that the financial authorities are using the excuse that digesting public bonds beyond the limit may lead to a financial crisis and are neglecting the urgent and indispensable military preparations, disregarding national defense defects. This method is absolutely unacceptable. The necessary military expenditure is for the sake of the country's century-long defense consolidation, and it will still be strongly demanded. At present, the relevant officials are enthusiastically calculating and sorting it out. The standard budget for the Manchurian Incident, the capital preparation costs, the aviation budget, and the overall estimates for other regular and temporary budgets for the next year will be submitted to the Army Minister before August 1. Army Minister Lin will convene a budget conference after Vice Minister Hashimoto returns to Tokyo to conduct a detailed review. The Army has decided to demand the necessary minimum and return it to the Ministry of Finance. It is said that the requested budget amount can reach approximately 660 to 700 million yen.

<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the Army's large-scale expansion of the Army Air Force, after various research results, it was decided to newly establish an aviation department. Therefore, before the order for periodic changes on August 1, the military order will be announced, with the following content:</p>
<p>(1) Newly established flying corps: In order to exert the maximum capacity of aviation in wartime, it should be organized into an independent large air force with the Army and Navy air forces. Recently, the organization of the air forces of various countries also has this meaning. Therefore, the formation of a flying corps by combining several flying regiments to become a combat unit is the stage to achieve that ideal. Therefore, the first flying corps will be newly established in Kakamigahara on August 1, and the corps will be newly established in Korea and Taiwan next year. (2) Newly established anti-aircraft artillery regiment. (3) Increased flight schools. (4) Reorganization of the Aviation Headquarters: The Aviation Headquarters' previous four-department system will be changed to a three-department system. Another aviation factory will be established as a supervisory body for technical aspects. This factory will be located in Tokyo and will have four branch factories in Tateyama, Kakamigahara, Korea, and Taiwan. (Telecommunications, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding Minister Tokonami's policy of promoting civil aviation, the Army strongly supports it. During the era of former Army Minister Araki, he ordered the Army Vice Minister to participate in his plans to realize it. It has now been decided to implement it with a ten-year plan starting next year. When negotiations begin between the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Finance regarding the Ministry of Communications' civil aviation enrichment fee of 230 million yuan, Army Minister Lin will naturally speak from time to time, considering the trends in the world's civil aviation industry and the current situation of its personnel. From a national defense perspective, a plan to enrich civil aviation must be established to assist Minister Tokonami. (Telecommunications, 28th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the government's statement on clarifying the national essence, it will be discussed at the Cabinet meeting on August 1. If all Cabinet members have no objections, it can be issued on the same day. However, this government statement will have a significant impact on the Japanese political situation, and its future is extremely noteworthy. The most important thing to pay attention to is the trend of the military. The military hopes to completely eliminate the organ theory, but the government believes that it has not been able to simply determine what the organ theory is. Therefore, the bureau will make the clarification of the national essence the main point of the statement and attach the exclusion of the organ theory. Therefore, if the issuance of this statement provokes the military to adopt a tough attitude, the Seiyukai will also take the opportunity to launch a large-scale attack on the organ theory. Other right-wing groups may also rise up. It is doubtful whether this attitude can be eased. Therefore, the content of the government statement may instead stir up the atmosphere of attacking the organ theory and turn into a torch to attack the current government, which is quite worrying. Although the government hopes to solve the organ theory issue with this statement, the political situation after the issuance of the statement will still become more complicated. It is generally believed that this matter should be carefully watched. (United Press, 28th)</p>

<p>(Changchun) According to a public statement sealed by the Mongolian Affairs Department at 7:00 PM on the 27th, the single-handed situation of the Naiman Banner Office is as follows: At 4:30 AM on the 23rd, Liu Zhendong's army attacked from the east and southwest. The police were immediately dispatched to fight in various parts of the city. Due to the disparity in strength, the enemy invaded the city at 10:30 AM, resulting in a fierce street battle. Police Officer Fujikawa fought back with a machine gun, but he could not resist. He returned to the Banner Office. Councilor Yamamori and others decided to defend the Naiman Office to the death. The "bandits" surrounded the office to prevent the office staff from escaping. At the same time, they launched a general attack from the southwest. At noon, they approached the office by no more than ten meters. The artillery fire was extremely fierce. Although Councilor Yamamori and others continued their tragic battle, they eventually exhausted their strength and planned to open a bloody path to escape. As a result of the discussion among the Japanese staff, it was decided to use a car to load the safe, important documents, etc., and break through the encirclement from the main gate to the south. However, they could not succeed. The bloody battle lasted until the ammunition ran out. Except for Police Officer Fujikawa and his wife, all other staff members were killed in battle.

The Steel Helmet League has adopted a hostile attitude towards the National Socialist Party government, which can be seen in this move." (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>(Husum, Germany) The recent disbandment of the Steel Helmet League in Ludwigsburg, Bengerem, and Waren was caused by the secret storage of weapons by the league. After the secret police searched the homes of the important figures of the Steel Helmet League, they found countless rifles, pistols, and other military weapons. Several leaders of the Steel Helmet League have now been detained. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>

<p>(Berlin) A fierce anti-Semitic movement will soon occur here again. It is said that the current movements against the Catholic Social Party, the Communist Party, and the anti-National Socialist faction of university students will continue. However, the most important attack will be concentrated on the Jewish people. Anti-Semitic leader Streicher gave a speech in Munich today for four hours. At that time, he claimed that Führer Hitler would appoint him as the national anti-Semitic leader and said that the anti-Semitic movement in the future would be even more fierce. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The new police commissioner, Helldorf, after discussing with the National Socialist Party authorities today, issued a notice saying that in recent days, party members have held anti-Semitic movements, which have been seduced by unscrupulous elements, resulting in individual overstepping actions. The leaders of the country and the party have repeatedly advised party members not to have individual overstepping actions. However, party members still have pictures and words, wantonly defacing the shop signs and glass windows of Jewish stores, and even prohibiting the intervention of the police, which is very inappropriate. The anti-Semitic movement must obey the orders of the country and the party and should not be recklessly carried out by individuals. If such actions occur again in the future, they will definitely be investigated and punished. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>

<p>(Vienna) The federal government recently issued a secret order to the governors of all provinces, saying, "The restoration is not yet a question. The government does not want to hear any incitement. Regarding the change of the political system, the government will never act rashly before soliciting the opinions of the people and contacting foreign countries. The propaganda movement of the restoration faction can hinder the government's freedom of action in diplomacy and should not be tolerated. The most prominent actions of the royalists recently are to grant the members of the Habsburg royal family the rights of honorary citizens by the local city councils. It is understandable if these places are related to the royal family members, but it is not appropriate to use the qualifications of honorary citizens as a tool to express political views. The government hereby requests the local city councils not to grant the Duke Otto, the heir to the royal family, the rights of honorary citizens again." In addition, the government ordered the authorities of all provinces to seriously monitor the royalist gatherings. People generally interpret this order as meaning that the restoration could cause disputes in Europe, and the government has decided to restrain it. (Havas, 27th)</p>

<p>英工黨的遠東外交政策　日內瓦通信　痛斥保守黨謀與日本諒解　工黨政府應努力援助中國　並指出中國有助於聯盟國</p>
<p>British Labour Party’s Far East Foreign Policy</p>
<p>Geneva Correspondence</p>
<p>Strongly condemns the Conservative Party’s attempt to reach an understanding with Japan.</p>
<p>The Labour government should strive to assist China.</p>
<p>And points out that China is beneficial to the Allied Powers.</p>
<p>In this year's local elections, the British Labour Party has already gained the most votes among all parties. It is generally speculated that it will still hold the most votes in the October general election this year. For several months, as each party has raised its banners and drums in preparation for the election, the British Labour Party has already passed its proclaimed policies regarding future finance, politics, military affairs, and diplomacy. Leading figures in the party have written more than ten propaganda pamphlets to convey these policies to the national public. This article is an excerpt from the chapter on the Labour Party's Far East Foreign Policy in the book "Labour's Way to Peace" by Henderson, an important leader of the Labour Party, for the reference of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Henderson served as the Foreign Secretary of the Labour government in 1930 and was one of the promoters of technical cooperation between China and the League of Nations. International public opinion has considerable respect and faith in Henderson, who emphasizes a peaceful diplomatic policy. Therefore, he was elected chairman of the World Disarmament Conference in 1932 and received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1933. Henderson has continuously worked hard for the international peace movement. Regarding the Sino-Japanese issue, he has always advocated implementing the obligations of the League of Nations Covenant, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Pact of Paris. The Labour Party has always paid attention to the deep-seated terror caused by the events in the Far East, so it has never underestimated the seriousness of the situation, believing that the Asian issue is the pivot of the world and feeling that the current economic downturn contains extremely great dangers. Japan's aggression and general disregard for the dignity of treaty obligations are sufficient to create elements of terror in the international community. We still remember the editorial of the Times on October 4th of last year, which stated, "Undoubtedly, the upward trend of Japan's military policy in the Far East and the problem of Germany's increasing armaments under the Hitler system are the two most important issues to consider carefully." The Labour Party also truly felt that not only did the German events reflect the Geneva Conference's inability to implement the principle of equal security interests, but the situation in the Far East was the primary reason for the Disarmament Conference's loss of legitimate protection of security.</p>
<p>The Labour Party formally declared that the first step must be to eliminate the threat of war in the Far East under all possible powers, placing it on the stand of the League of Nations Covenant, the Nine-Power Treaty, the Pact of Paris, and the League of Nations General Assembly report on the Manchurian dispute. Furthermore, it should adopt a close cooperative attitude with the United States and Russia, and take international action based on all treaties prohibiting war to resist the aggression in the Far East that violates covenants and any motives that provoke war. Furthermore, the Labour Party will use its various abilities to help China escape the oppression of imperialism and strive to prevent situations that undermine China's territorial integrity and political independence. Under the guarantee of international action, the people of the East should be given a reasonable life, and the points in the report of the special General Assembly of the League of Nations should be made even clearer: (1) Manchuria is a part of Chinese territory. The implementation of the Nine-Power Treaty for Manchuria is the same as for any part under Chinese sovereignty. (2) Japan's current military occupation of Manchuria was caused by Japan's military actions and cannot be regarded as self-defense. China bears no responsibility for it. The existence of this occupation violates Article 10 of the Covenant and Article 1 of the Nine-Power Treaty. (3) Maintaining and recognizing the current system in Manchuria created and supervised by the Japanese authorities is against the interests of China and contradicts the wishes of the 95% of the Chinese people in that area. Its existence runs counter to the purposes of maintaining peace in the Far East under the Covenant, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Pact of Paris. (4) Maintaining peace in the Far East is an important international issue. The General Assembly report suggests restoring Chinese rule in the non-military and non-autonomous areas, paying attention to protecting Japan's legitimate rights and interests, taking into account the position of Soviet Russia in northern Manchuria and the open-door policy, and uniting to assist the Chinese government in all construction plans through international cooperation. The report finally binds all member states to not recognize "Manchukuo" in law or in fact and to oppose any actions that encourage this destruction of treaty law and to consistently follow the policies in the report. The advisory committee produced by the General Assembly, the United States, and Soviet Russia, have all sent representatives to participate after accepting the report. Britain, as a member of the Executive Council, is naturally among them. China has already accepted the report, but Japan has refused, so the entire dispute still exists without any resolution. Therefore, the League of Nations' responsibility to maintain peace and security and to supervise treaty obligations has not been fulfilled. The Labour Party's policy is to faithfully implement the non-recognition policy based on this situation and to make the League of Nations' technical cooperation plan with China effective in maintaining peace. The Labour Party believes that only by maintaining peace can the Japanese people be awakened to the enormous burden of their military spending, the pain of military adventurism in Manchuria causing financial exhaustion and commercial imbalance, and the increase in the national power of China and the Soviet Union. Then, the hostile actions of the whole world can be eliminated. The Japanese people can then recognize that the suggestions in the General Assembly report are equally pure and sincere for both China and Japan and are the only way to avoid national disaster.</p>
<p>However, the Labour Party feels that the current situation lacks justice and is difficult to secure. It is clear that if the League of Nations and the United States do not cooperate in advance and implement sanctions for peace regarding various new opportunities for war, it will be difficult to maintain. Therefore, the Labour government advocates close cooperation with the United States and Soviet Russia, taking consistent action to deal with aggressors and those who violate treaties, and ensuring that any new opportunities for war are addressed with global action to sanction them by invoking various conventions for the prevention of war. This policy will result in League members and the United States demonstrating complete fidelity and effective final results in implementing the treaty obligations in the report. (Omission by reporter: This section describes the value of the Lytton Report and the process of the investigation team, which the Chinese people already know, so it is not repeated.) Given the situation, there are things that we cannot refrain from saying. In the Conservative Party and its official newspaper, and in a certain part of the city, there is still a potential force that despises the League of Nations General Assembly report and treaty obligations and wants to establish an understanding with Japan by accommodating Japan's occupation of Manchuria. On the other hand, Conservative Party members of parliament are quite silent in diplomatic debates and are also showing negativity regarding the issue of restoring the Anglo-Japanese alliance under certain conditions. However, most Conservative Party newspapers extremely adhere to the aforementioned opinion. In the summer of 1934, when the parliament was opening, the British Department of Industry sent a delegation to Manchuria for economic investigation, and even found many violent remarks and various publications regarding that claim. From a politician's perspective, if it could be said that there was a need to compromise with Japan before the Great War, then their argument is that their tendency towards Japan is still the same as the situation when Britain and France jointly conspired to divide Morocco and Egypt with Imperial Russia, intending to choose another person to lead the war, or to unite with Japan to oppress China under the conditions of political, commercial, and naval understandings. This policy is unlikely to succeed because it disregards the League of Nations Covenant and the Nine-Power Treaty, and does not consider that the Chinese Kuomintang is growing stronger and that its country can no longer be subjected to the humiliation of a certain sphere of influence, willingly being protected, or being divided by others. As a result, we cannot avoid falling into a situation of hostility with the Soviet Union and the United States, and it opens up further military ambitions for those in power in Japan. This policy only creates war and cannot promote peace. Given this contradictory situation, any British government should not take this path in terms of morality and common sense. However, those who tend towards this policy are still working hard to use their power to hinder the free development of any reform policies. Therefore, we must strongly oppose an attitude that only has the nominal appearance of joining the Covenant, but in reality encourages speculative forces of aggressors and abandons our treaty obligations, because that policy can only fuel war and cannot achieve peace, and is sufficient to make the world after the Great War even more chaotic than before. If we hide under this kind of behavior, we will inevitably face a dangerous final outcome. We believe that the only policy to maintain peace is to stand openly on the stand of treaty obligations and implement them effectively, and it is also the only policy after the Great War that can reconcile moral, legal, and material requirements, and can monitor any new opportunities for war under the international action of various conventions for the prevention of war. To understand the true meaning of the above, we should understand the malformed development of various acts of war, and the current military occupation of the four eastern provinces of China, which is a violation of the Covenant, should be recognized by the countries that accepted the League of Nations General Assembly report as an act of aggression. If we recognize this war as self-defense, it is equivalent to rejecting the Covenant, the Nine-Power Treaty, the Pact of Paris, and the League of Nations General Assembly report. If Britain does not take a decisive and bright stand in any form of destruction or challenge, the great powers such as Russia, France, and Italy will undoubtedly follow suit. The United States will also sincerely support and provide diplomatic assistance. On the principle of equality, there is no need to doubt that the entire League of Nations will be controlled by a certain country. In this way, not only can stable results be obtained, but also a solid policy of peace and order can be gradually restored in the Far East.</p>
<p>The League of Nations General Assembly report has already stated that for the sake of world peace interests, the League of Nations technical cooperation should continue to assist China, and according to the request of the Chinese government, improve the lives of its people and strengthen its country. The League of Nations has always provided this kind of mechanical assistance. The Labour government also wants to take this opportunity to strive to help China consolidate politically and economically, not for the interests of various financial groups, but for the benefit of the Chinese people and the wider world.</p>
<p>The Labour Party will also strive to eliminate the extremely dangerous obstacles to the future of world peace, and the past feudal policies of imperialism and economic exploitation. Practical cooperation with the Soviet Union and the United States can be realized in this policy, because this policy is suitable for the interests of both countries and the actual and spiritual relationship with China in all aspects.</p>
<p>We should remember that when the Allied countries (referring to the European War) requested China's assistance in the struggle due to the difficulties of the Great War, China received the promise of the Allied countries at the same time that after the end of the war, they would recognize China as a first-class country in the international community. If such a promise was given in return without meaning at the time, then its intention for China is even more obvious. China participated in the unified action of the Allied countries with its entire policy, and its purpose was nothing more than to take this opportunity to promote its national status.</p>
<p>Years later (1922), when countries signed the Nine-Power Treaty, they agreed to give China the most perfect and convenient opportunity to develop and maintain a strong and effective government. On May 22, 1926, Sir Chamberlain's note to China outlined that the so-called countries should "abandon their concept that China's economic and political development cannot develop without the protection of foreigners." The great powers should adopt that policy and strive to maintain harmonious relations with China, without having to wait specifically or because China must first establish a strong central government. In May 1931, the Labour government very enthusiastically initiated and approved the construction draft of the Chinese Economic Commission and the League of Nations technical cooperation plan. At the same time, the Labour government also raised the issue of discussing the return of British concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality promised at the Washington Conference. And in 1933, the Lytton Report, passed by the League of Nations General Assembly, also described how the political and economic construction of China has progressed and how radical the national thinking is. In 1934, Dr. Rajchman, the League of Nations technical liaison officer in China, expressed in his surprising report that the entire construction situation of the Chinese government and its Economic Commission, and how hard the masses worked. The report shows that all political, financial, and administrative responsibilities in the entire construction work are borne by China itself. Any external assistance is of an advisory and passive nature, so that China can get rid of the protection relationship between the great powers and the various interest groups of the great powers. Therefore, Western countries must finally correct themselves in order to realize the principle of equality and reciprocity.</p>
<p>A country with a population of 400 million, more than 4,000 years of inheritance, and land larger than the whole of Europe, wants to improve and unite into a strong country, which is not an easy thing. But many undertakings have been completed, and the future has been prepared, and the final success of the development of its unified national thinking must be the same as that of other countries. It can be seen that China is sufficient to build its vast country even today, not to mention the convenience of the League of Nations technical cooperation. The British Labour Party has always advocated giving China various assistance with its League of Nations membership rights, because we are sure that this move must be taken for the benefit of all mankind. We sincerely hope in advance that the great Chinese nation will occupy an appropriate position among the countries leading the world. The Labour Party's policy of restoring the legal order in the Far East, in short, is inseparable from the idea of equal friendship and respect for the Chinese and Japanese nations.</p>
<p>We must have a definite direction of peace, so that peace can exist. The implementation of the Covenant can be free from terror or partiality, and it must be strictly enforced to not recognize "Manchukuo" and to make persistent attempts to make the Manchurian issue a practical and fair outcome for the other party. For China, the League of Nations cooperation plan provides effective assistance. This is a practical and solid policy based on our treaty obligations, the public opinion of the League of Nations General Assembly and the Lytton Investigation Team, enlightened self-interest, and the need for peace and justice. The Labour Party is ready to lead this way in restoring faith and hope to overcome and avoid the current dangers of war. (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>魯南　運河又突潰决　一日之間决口六處　風大浪急搶堵無效　湖河相連一片汪洋</p>
<p>Southern Shandong The Grand Canal Suddenly Breached Again</p>
<p>Six Breaches in One Day</p>
<p>High Winds and Raging Waves Make Plugging Ineffective</p>
<p>Lakes and Rivers Connected into a Vast Expanse of Water</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since the Yellow River breached in Shandong Province, the floodwaters have flowed southward, running through the Zhushui and Zhao Wang rivers into the Nanyang Lakes. All rivers and canals have been taken over by the flood, causing breaches and inundations, and reports of loss have been constantly received. Unexpectedly, today's (24th) news reports that the downstream of the Grand Canal in the territory suddenly reported a breach again. Six breaches occurred in one day, and the floodwaters rushed towards the northeast, threatening to go directly to Jining and Yanzhou, which is extremely serious. Since the southward shift of the Yellow River breach, the Southern Grand Canal has been between the Yellow River and the various lakes in Jiangsu and Shandong, and the floodwaters have been pouring in, causing it to overflow its banks long ago. Recently, the water from Nanyang Lake has been overflowing westward, and it was expected that the water could be discharged downstream to avoid danger. However, the river water has continued to rise sharply. This morning (24th) at around 3:00 AM, a breach suddenly occurred in the Xin Dian embankment, 25 li south of Jining City. The breach was over two zhang wide. While attempting to plug it, another breach suddenly occurred at 9:00 AM south of Xin Zha, over two zhang wide. County Magistrate Zhen Guangyuan led over a thousand laborers in a desperate attempt to defend it. However, due to the sky-high winds and waves, the large and rapid floodwaters, and the fact that the area adjoins the shore of Nanyang Lake, the lake water was backing up and connecting with the river, making it impossible to salvage the situation. The waterhead went straight to the northeast, and at noon, it reached west of the Jizhou automobile road, with the water depth on the plains being four to five chi. At the same time, the water overflowing from the Wang Guitun Lake embankment also passed Anju and reached south of the Xin Tiao River. The water backing up southwest of the Jiaji automobile road from Nanyang Lake reached east of the Jijin automobile road, with water depths varying from five to six chi. And at 4:00 PM, the Grand Canal breached at four locations four li north of Xin Dian at the same time, including one breach that was over three zhang wide, one that was over one zhang wide, and two that were over one zhang wide. The floodwaters merged and rushed straight to the northeast. The Jining County Magistrate immediately ordered the laborers to desperately rescue the situation, but due to the vastness of the waters, it was ineffective. They are currently using boats to rescue the disaster victims. (25th)</p>
<p>閻錫山報吿　陜北共匪蔓延</p>
<p>Yan Xishan Reports on the Spread of Communist Bandits in Northern Shaanxi</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Although there have been reports on the spread of Communist bandits in northern Shaanxi, they have not been detailed. Taiyuan Pacification Commissioner Yan Xishan gave a detailed report on this at the memorial week meeting of the Pacification Headquarters to urge the people of Shanxi to be vigilant. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>Recently, officers from the bandit suppression army coming from northern Shaanxi to the province have described the situation of the Communist bandits in northern Shaanxi, which is appalling.</p>
<p>There are twenty-three counties in northern Shaanxi, eight of which are completely Red. Now, the Communist Party in northern Shaanxi already has the power to expand its area without using force. They call expanding the area "opening up," and the tools of expansion are called "opening up teams." The cruelty of the Communists is even more shocking. In a village that has been made Red, the people who must be killed are civil and military officials, teachers, and all those who have earned public money. In addition, local gentry, wealthy merchants, and those who lend money are also on the list of those who must be killed. As for rich peasants, if they do not resist, they may be spared. If they resist, they must also be completely killed. The only punishment is killing. If a crime is committed, they must be killed, those who are late for meetings are killed, those who delay business are killed, those who leak inside information are killed, and those who say that the Communist Party is bad are killed. What is especially cruel is that in a village, if there is a family that has not destroyed the water, destroyed the pot, and destroyed the rice and noodles, so that the National Army can use them for food and drink, the entire village will be killed, so that the National Army has no water to drink, no pot to use, and no food to eat, which is a major difficulty for the suppression. The cruelty is such that many people have been killed. About 100,000 people have been killed by them, accounting for about one-seventh of the population. This is where their hatefulness and detestability lie, and this is also where their fearfulness lies. The remaining 600,000 people fear the Communist Party more than they fear the National Army. Even when husbands and wives, brothers, and brothers speak privately, they do not dare to say bad things about the Communist Party, for fear of being known by the Communist Party, and for fear that fathers, sons, husbands, wives, and brothers are monitoring each other. The method used by the Communist Party is to threaten and lure, especially using great power and great benefits. Therefore, those who feel the Communist Party's kindness will naturally be loyal to the Communist Party's cause, and those who fear the Communist Party's power will naturally give up their thoughts of resisting the Communist Party.</p>
<p>These situations are really terrible. Shanxi is closely connected with northern Shaanxi and should make every effort to prevent it. Suppressing the Communists is still 70% political and 30% military, and preventing the Communists should be 90% political and 10% military. In preventing the Communists politically, we must pay attention to ensuring that the majority of the people have anti-Communist organizations, and especially that those who are the targets of the Communist Party must clearly understand and have strict organizations. Because with organization, there is strength, and with strength, we can prevent the Communists. When the Communist Parties in Italy and Germany were causing the greatest danger, the governments of those two countries were also helpless. It was not until the gentry, merchants, wealthy households, and large families who were the targets of the Communist Party woke up and organized anti-Communist forces that the country and society were safe. The American people are more educated, and President Roosevelt was able to implement the New Economic Policy before the danger of the Communist Party was discovered to take preventive measures in advance. The Chinese people are too uneducated, and the gentry, merchants, wealthy households, and large families are not easy to awaken, especially not easy to organize, while the proletariat is easily incited. If we want to overcome this danger, it is not only more difficult than in the United States, but also more difficult than in Italy and Germany.</p>
<p>This can be said to be a very worrisome thing, a very terrible thing, and a very dangerous thing for the nation. I hope everyone will pay close attention to this in a timely and practical manner and study a method that can make the majority of people aware. Anyone who has an opinion can submit a proposal.

<p>皖省防黃與　長江堤貸欵搶險　省府派員查黃水南侵　搶險貸欵辦法業已訂頒</p>
<p>Anhui Province's Yellow River Prevention and Yangtze River Embankment Loan Rescue</p>
<p>Provincial Government Sends Personnel to Investigate Southward Intrusion of Yellow River Waters</p>
<p>Measures for Rescue Loans Already Ordered and Promulgated</p>
<p>Anqing Report: The Anhui Provincial Government, due to the Yellow River breaches in northern Jiangsu and southern Henan, and with Jiangsu Province already implementing preventive measures, in order to prevent the Yellow River waters from intruding southward and flowing into the Huai River, telegraphed separately to Sixth District Administrative Inspector Lu Peizhang and Seventh District Administrative Inspector Nan Yuejun, deciding on a date to convene county magistrates from the relevant four counties – Lingbi, Suxian, Mengcheng, Guoyang – as well as Hao County, Taihe, Fuyang, and Linquan – a total of nine county magistrates, at a suitable location in Bobei County, to discuss effective prevention methods. The Provincial Government also telegraphed instructions to each of the aforementioned counties to pay close attention to defense. Now, in order to thoroughly prevent the situation, the Provincial Government has specially dispatched Commissioner Cui Bingsen to conduct an inspection and has instructed him to first go to Suxian to coordinate the meeting location. It has also telegraphed the nine county governments of Siling, etc., to be informed.</p>
<p>The Yangtze River water level in Anhui Province has shown a trend of receding in recent days. However, due to the sudden rise of tides and the outbreak of mountain floods, many embankments and dikes along the river and inland rivers that are weak have still been breached. The more important ones are the Guangcheng, Bao Ying, Mei Hu, and Bao Ju embankments in Huaining; the Yu Feng and Yong Feng embankments in Tongcheng; the Rui Xing, Lao [blank] Zhou, Zhang Jia Zhou, and Guan Zhuang embankments in Tongling; and the Yong Feng, Da Cheng, Tian Bao, and Su Cun embankments in Fanchang. The affected area is estimated to be no less than 200,000 mu. Regarding the rescue of breaches and the relief of disaster victims, the Provincial Government has already ordered the relevant counties to pay close attention and has issued ten articles of measures for loaning funds for rescue operations on the Yangtze River dikes: (1) The Anhui Provincial Government has specially allocated 10,000 yuan from the disaster relief reserve fund to provide loans to various counties for assisting in the rescue of dangerous dike projects along the Yangtze River, to be handled in accordance with these measures. (2) In the case of the main dike or branch dikes closely connected to the main dike, involving more than 5,000 mu of farmland, after encountering danger and rescuing, the financial and construction departments will review and approve the report, and then the construction department will prepare the receipts and borrow from the finance department, and order the county government to issue a stamped borrowing certificate and go to the construction department to collect the loan. The format of the stamped borrowing certificate will be specified separately. Those who have already been allocated from this fund by the provincial treasury will still supplement according to the established procedure. (4) After receiving the loan, the county government should describe the needs of each embankment for rescue and distribute the funds accordingly. (5) For each embankment to prepare rescue funds, the county magistrate will designate the responsible gentry and directors of each embankment to issue a receipt, the format of which may refer to the stamped borrowing certificate issued by the county government. (6) The method for recovering the rescue loans for each embankment. (7) Rescue loans must not be diverted to other uses. If it is discovered that the funds are not used for rescue after each embankment receives them, in addition to immediately forcing the return, they will be punished according to the law. (8) The maximum repayment period for rescue loans is ten months. (9) The county government is fully responsible to the provincial government for repaying the loans within the specified time. The financial committee of the county shall also be held responsible. (10) If the county magistrate is replaced when the repayment deadline is reached, the entire case of this loan should be specifically handed over to the successor for review and acceptance, and the new magistrate should continue to be responsible and submit a report to the provincial government for record.

<p>Recent Economic Situation in Guangdong Province</p>
<p>Spring Import Surplus Exceeds 17 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Cash Depletion in Counties and Cities, Rural Areas Show Signs of Famine</p>
<p>Commercial Depression in Cities, Many Shops Close Down</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since the beginning of this year, the social depression in Guangdong Province has worsened. The rural economy has collapsed, and foreign trade, due to the rise in silver prices, has seen a daily decrease in the export of domestic products. Major exports such as raw silk, silk fabrics, tobacco, homespun cloth, and fruits have all declined. The export of raw silk to the Americas had not even a single package in June. In addition, silk exports to Europe were only over 400 packages, and Asia and India had a total of 2,500 packages. There were no other transactions at all. Homespun cloth and tobacco were originally the main exports to Southeast Asia, but recently, Southeast Asia has been flooded by goods from a certain country, competing for the market, resulting in the near-total interruption of homespun cloth exports in recent months. The silk fabric industry in Guanshan of Nanhai, Shiqiao of Panyu, and Chencun of Shunde has all stagnated in the first half of the year. Taking the silk fabric industry in Yanbu, Nanhai, as an example, over a thousand workers have lost their jobs. With the sharp decline in the aforementioned various export goods, the social economy has been depleted. Moreover, due to the high silver prices, foreign goods have poured in at the same time. According to statistics, the import surplus in Guangdong Province in the spring reached over 17 million yuan. The value of foreign goods imported and domestic goods exported in Guangdong Province in the spring is detailed below: (A) Value of foreign goods imported in January, February, and March: (1) Guangzhou: 9,195,499 yuan, (2) Shantou: 6,671,759 yuan, (3) Kowloon: 16,933,364 yuan, (4) Gongbei: 1,931,305 yuan, (5) Jiangmen: 1,170,154 yuan, (6) Sanshui: 345,980 yuan, (7) Qiongzhou: 595,119 yuan, (8) Beihai: 310,999 yuan, Total: 37,155,479 yuan. (B) Value of domestic goods exported in January, February, and March: (1) Guangzhou: 11</p>

<p>Hoping the Public Will Be Wary and Avoid Such Actions</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, in light of the recent economic downturn and the increasing number of unemployed, which has led to a surge in suicides, believes that if this trend is not stopped and prevented, the future of the nation will be unimaginable. Therefore, the bureau has decided to place multiple suicide prevention signs in prominent locations to warn the public and encourage them to be cautious. The bureau has already completed six such signs and installed them yesterday near the Jiucunqiao Bridge at Yimiao. They will gradually be extended to other locations.</p>

<h3 id="e51">Eight-Guild Fish Industry Association Hopes the Fish Market Will Not Adopt a Broker System <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>If Adopted, Commission Must Be Reduced</p>
<p>According to Guowen News Agency, the Ministry of Industry is building a fish market in Shanghai to regulate the fish production in Jiangsu and Zhejiang and alleviate the suffering of fishermen. The factory buildings, cold storage, etc., are nearing completion and are expected to begin operation by the end of next month. The market will adopt a broker system similar to the Japanese central wholesale market, merging existing fish shops into the market as brokers, and stipulating a commission of 0.8% for fishermen, with 0.3% going to the market and 0.5% to the brokers. However, the fish merchants are not satisfied with this system and commission distribution. According to Mr. Xu Yifei of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Eight-Guild Fish Industry Association, they firmly oppose the fish market's adoption of the broker system, believing it is a form of exploitation of fishermen. If the fish market lacks management talent, they suggest hiring existing fish shop managers. If the market insists on using a broker system, the broker's commission should not be 0.5%. In the past, fishermen, while exploited by the fish shops, could still benefit from loans. Now that the fish shops have stopped providing loans, they are still required to pay a 0.5% commission, which is a significant loss for the fishermen, so they vow not to accept it.</p>

<p>Wang Xiangxun Dies Tragically from Fatal Wound</p>
<p>At approximately 10 PM last night, two robbers attempted a robbery at the Jiyi Pawnshop located at No. 640, Hai'ning Road near North Henan Road. Only one robber had a handgun. They entered through the back door and rushed into the shop. The employees were unable to resist and were locked up. The robbers demanded the keys to the money room and the treasure room, hoping to loot the place. However, the employees refused to comply. During the struggle, Wang Xiangxun, a 45-year-old employee from Pudong, took advantage of the robbers' inattention and escaped through the back door, running into the street and shouting for help. As a result, the robbers were unable to complete the robbery and fled in haste. However, Wang Xiangxun believed that the robbers had already achieved their goal, so he continued to pursue them while shouting. Unexpectedly, the robbers, in desperation, turned around and fired a shot, hitting Wang in the head. He collapsed to the ground, and the robbers calmly escaped. By the time the police arrived, they were long gone. Wang Xiangxun was rushed to the Tongren Hospital for treatment, but unfortunately, the injury was fatal, and he had lost too much blood. The bullet had penetrated his skull, so he died at approximately 10:40 PM that night. The body has been sent to the morgue for an autopsy this morning. The escaped robbers are being actively pursued by the police.</p>

<p>Due to Fraudulent Collection of Dues, Please Alert Fellow Businesses Not to Be Deceived</p>
<p>The Tiger Cart Industry Mutual Aid Association issued a notice yesterday:</p>
<p>Notice Regarding the Recent Proposed Tax Increase by the Shanghai Municipal Council on Tiger Carts. Due to the unbearable burden on our industry, we urgently appealed, and esteemed organizations, taxpaying Chinese associations, and Chinese directors have spoken out on our behalf, ultimately achieving the cancellation of the tax increase and reducing our burden. To promote permanent unity and plan for the future, a general meeting of members was held on July 25th at the New World on Nanjing Road to formally establish the Mutual Aid Association. However, we have recently learned that unscrupulous individuals are fraudulently collecting membership fees in the name of the association. We are deeply saddened by this. We would like to clarify that the association has not dispatched anyone to collect any fees since its establishment. If it becomes necessary to collect membership fees for the benefit of our members in the future, we will do so legally, issue official receipts as proof, and ensure transparency. We urge all fellow businesses to be vigilant and not be deceived.</p>

<p>If No Response, Party and Government Authorities Will Be Notified</p>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, over 1,000 fresh meat businesses in the Shanghai International Settlement, in opposition to the secret increase in transportation fees by the four slaughterhouses (Su Xi, Ninghai, Ninghu, and Renyuan), held a general meeting of representatives from all businesses the day before yesterday (12th) to discuss a solution. Yesterday, the industry jointly sent a letter of inquiry to the four slaughterhouses:</p>
<p>Respectful Greetings: Our industry previously had a dispute with the pig dealers in Wusong regarding additional fees. Your company and others intervened to mediate, resulting in a reduction of the dock fee and shop commission by 3 cents per pig, while the transportation fee was to be paid by the dealers (based on the vehicle price). Now, the transportation company responsible for transporting the pigs claims that they only charge 15 cents per pig (with 20 cents listed on the invoice paid by the dealer), and the remaining 5 cents must be secretly given to your company as a special expense. We are shocked and do not know what this special expense is for. We, therefore, jointly request your company to make a clear announcement within three days to clarify the truth. With anticipation, we remain, Respectfully,</p>
<p>To: Su Xi, Ninghu, Ninghai, Renyuan Slaughterhouses.</p>
<p>It is said that the industry has decided that if the four slaughterhouses do not respond, they will appeal to the Party and Government authorities for investigation.</p>

Since advertising for novelty entertainment, many people have come to discuss possibilities. Such performances as Tongchun Yue Opera, young women's dance troupe, novelty magic, refined drama, Qunfang Chorus, comic skit, famous storytelling, etc., are all in consideration. In addition, there are unheard-of oddities, such as three-headed beauties, egg lice dancing, six-horned two-tailed cattle, thousand-year-old turtles, shrimp and crab battles, etc., that the World is still selecting.</p>
<p>Participating Factories</p>
<p>As of yesterday, the following companies have joined the World as merchants: Guangdong Brothers Rubber Company, Taikang Food Company, Zheng Tuo Underwear Factory, Yang Yuxing Bakery, Yongxing Children's Clothing Factory, Renfeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Shende Chemical Industry Cooperative, Yongfeng Cotton Weaving, Jiahe Underwear Factory, Yutai Thermos Factory, Jingcheng Cotton Weaving Factory, Dekangxiang Underwear Factory, Family Biscuit Factory, Qingfu Silk Scarf Factory, Dacheng Weaving Factory, Meilun Silk Fabric Company, Fuchang Underwear Factory, Qingxiang Weaving Factory, Kaiming Cotton Weaving Factory, Yadong Knitting Factory, Deyi Leather Goods Factory, Sanyou Sock Factory, Henry Umbrella Factory, Sanxing Cotton Iron Factory, Capital Chemical Industry Cooperative, Berlin Sock Factory, Senyuanxiang Jewelry Factory, Yaguang Bakelite Factory, Hongyu Knitting Factory, Fengxiang Cotton Weaving Factory, Zhenni Factory, Yinglong Biscuit Factory, Yongchang Cloth Factory, Haixing Knitting Factory, Sino-French Pharmacy, Guangxinlong Cloud Gauze Factory, Huaxin Underwear Factory, Renli Industrial Cooperative, Changji Biscuit Factory, Hongyu Sock Factory, Yongxing Leather Goods Factory, Unique Standard Underwear Factory, Hu Kaiwen Great China Chemical Industry Cooperative, Huanqiu Umbrella Factory, Mingxing Shoe Factory, and more than 100 others.

<p>Free Display</p>
<p>Due to the vast number of national goods and the limited space in the World, it will not be possible to sell all of them. To maximize exposure, a National Goods Sample Display Room will be set up on the east side of the second floor, showcasing various national goods to allow the public to universally recognize them. It is said that national goods can be brought for display free of charge, but the quantity is limited: no more than three pieces for items measured by the piece, no more than three catties for items measured by weight, and no more than three feet for items measured by length. Upon the expiration of the display period, the exhibitor can reclaim the sample by presenting the original receipt.</p>

<p>The preparatory committee of the Dentists' Association of this city has been actively carrying out its work since receiving approval from the Municipal Party Committee and the Social Affairs Bureau. To unite the industry and seek common benefits, the association held an expanded solicitation meeting at its headquarters yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. The meeting was attended by all members of the preparatory committee and team leaders from various districts. Chen Run Sheng chaired the meeting, and Zhang Yiping recorded the minutes. After the formalities, the chairman gave a report stating that dental science in Europe, America, and Japan has progressed rapidly and occupies an important and independent position in medicine. In China, we are still lagging behind. Since 1927, many industries in Shanghai have established organizations to serve the country and society and improve the status of the industry, protect professional duties, and improve skills. This association has been approved by the Municipal Party Committee and the Social Affairs Bureau and is being organized according to the law. We are grateful for the efforts of the solicitation teams. However, there are still more dentists in the city who have not joined. We hope that all members will promote the association to others and avoid being spectators so that the association can be established as soon as possible. The meeting then resolved (1) to publish a special edition for the establishment of the Shanghai Dentists' Association when the inaugural general meeting is held; (2) to step up preparatory work to ensure formal establishment within the next month; and (3) to convene a preparatory meeting for the establishment in two weeks.</p>
<p>The meeting then adjourned and distributed a letter to all dentists in Shanghai concerning the organization of the Shanghai Dentists' Association (text omitted for brevity). The meeting adjourned around 5:00 PM.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Tobacco and Exchange Industry Association's offices in the Hu Fa district of the French Concession, for the sake of maintaining the industry, have noted that recently, with the sharp rise in foreign silver prices, it is difficult for members to profit from their business. Recently, non-industry people have opened small shops, concurrently engaged in tobacco and exchange, and mostly selling at low prices, adding to the competition, resulting in losses for both sides, and putting them on the brink of bankruptcy. The two offices have jointly dispatched personnel to investigate and urge colleagues to comply with the association's articles of association and industry regulations, not to disrupt market prices, and to harm business reputation. Those who violate these rules will be reported to the relevant authorities for punishment in accordance with the association's regulations to maintain discipline and protect the industry, in order to maintain livelihoods. The association has also hired Gong Tongyuan and Shen Guozhang as legal advisors to provide legal protection. Since the 20th of this month, Wang Kuiyuan, Xu Yunxiang, Guo Liangfu, Tao Zhongdian, Chen Zhenxiang, Liu Jialin, Yan Zhiwen, Zhang Zhuchuan, Shen Zhongmei, Xu Xueqing, and others have been dispatched to conduct investigations. It has been reported that the French Concession office has received reports from various members that the French Municipal Council has sent personnel to levy a tobacco and exchange donation for July, otherwise they will cut off water and electricity. Letters have been sent to the association requesting a quick solution.</p>

<h3 id="e69">Chinese Baseball Team Loses to Shanghai Textile Factory Again <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Three to Fourteen</p>
<p>Yesterday was the second act of the Shanghai Baseball League. The Chinese baseball team unfortunately lost to the Japanese Shanghai Textile Factory by a score of 14 to 3. After scoring three consecutive points in the first inning, the Chinese team was completely unable to advance, relying entirely on the Japanese team. The Japanese team, on the other hand, continued to score runs, accumulating a total of 14 points.</p>
<p>Too Many Walks</p>
<p>The Japanese team went first, with no results. The Chinese team followed, taking advantage of the carelessness and negligence of the Japanese team's catcher and third baseman. Unexpectedly, the Chinese team scored three consecutive runs in one fell swoop, creating a strong momentum. The Japanese team became more cautious after this change. In the second inning, they scored one point due to effective hitting. In the third inning, pitcher Yu Bohui gave up four walks in a row, creating a tense atmosphere as the bases were loaded. The Japanese team scored four runs in this inning, reversing the score to 5 to 3, and overwhelming the Chinese team. In the fifth inning, in a similar fashion, the Japanese team again loaded the bases, resulting in another three runs, making the score 8 to 3.</p>
<p>Impossible to Recover</p>
<p>Yu Bohui's high number of walks and the weakness of his pitches led Gan Zhen to replace him in the sixth inning. The Japanese team struck out one batter, then followed with a one-two base hit. Gan Zhen also gave up a walk, and due to an error by the third baseman, the Japanese team added five more points in this inning, making the score 13 to 3, an impossible situation to recover from. The Japanese team's excellent outfield play meant there were no errors on high balls. Under these circumstances, the Chinese team's hitting was ineffective, and they ultimately lost by a score of 14 to 3.</p>
<p>Chinese Team Score</p>

<p>Game Summary</p>
<p>Expected score: Shanghai Textile Factory 10, Chinese 4. Two-base hits: Sonny, Tanaka, Gaishan. Three-base hits: Gaosong,</p>

<p>A Discount Book Arrives in the Countryside by Leng Mo</p>
<p>The power of discount books has penetrated the countryside. Although there are already people reading newspapers in the countryside, and books printed with movable type are not lacking, few people have seen them. This is the first time that books printed with movable type have become accessible to genuine rural people. Before, the reading material for genuine rural people was photolithographed on glazed paper, and before that, it was woodblock printing. Now, original woodblock books are rarely seen in the countryside. The few that remain are either because woodblock printing requires a large investment, and booksellers try their best to support it as long as the printing block is not damaged, or because some books only available in woodblock versions have a continuous market in a certain area, a narrow market that is not noticed by photolithographic booksellers. In addition, all books that have a photolithographic version have long driven out the woodblock versions. From when did this annexation begin? There are naturally no historical materials to consult in the countryside. It probably coincided with the invasion of matches and foreign mirrors. The speed of annexation may not be as fast as foreign mirrors, but it is certainly more than matches. As far as I can remember, I have bought flint and steel, but I have never read a novel or storytelling ballad that was not photolithographed. Roughly speaking, from the time photolithography was introduced to the widespread distribution of photolithographic books in the countryside, the time was certainly much shorter than the initial gradual popularity of movable type and the invasion of stamped novels into the countryside. It is even more difficult to predict when discount books will completely annex photolithographic books. Naturally, gradual annexation is inevitable, but those who were engaged in photolithography in the past seemed to have a spirit of opening up new businesses, moving forward courageously, while the current discount books are a desperate remedy when the new book industry has reached a point where it cannot develop further. Their enterprising spirit must be lacking. Of course, on the one hand, many people are looking for a way out in this field due to the increasing number of unemployed people, selling such books to the countryside, but it is doubtful how much effect this kind of promotion can have in the declining countryside.</p>
<p>In addition, although the publishers of discount books target the inland areas for their vast sales, the countryside is also included. However, they have not paid much attention to the countryside. If the discount books I have seen in bookstores in Shanghai represent all that the publishers have printed, then many of the most popular books in the countryside have not been printed, such as short storytelling ballads in thin booklets. Rural people's reading habits are quite stubborn. These kinds of storytelling ballads have been passed down from the grandmothers' childhoods to the present. Only reading this kind of book is encouraged by the grandmothers, and sometimes it is simply read for the grandmothers' enjoyment. Although the grandmothers have heard such stories countless times, they never get tired of them. Perhaps it is true that no matter what book it is, the more you read it, the more meaningful it becomes. When the children who read storytelling ballads to the grandmothers enter middle age, they unconsciously pick up the grandmothers' habits again. However, no matter how stubborn the grandmothers are, change will eventually come. We can always hear the grandmothers lamenting that certain books they read or heard in their childhood are no longer available. This is of course because they have been eliminated by photolithographic books. In this way, photolithographic books are somewhat different from woodblock books, as you can imagine. The degree of difference may not be as great as the difference between photolithographic books and movable type. The great difference will certainly be a reason for the extended lifespan of photolithographic books, but it may also create a fierce elimination in the future. I wonder if anyone thinks that these inferior photolithographic books may become rare and precious books in the future.</p>
<p>These two successive eliminations will gradually unify the reading materials in various parts of the inland areas and, in some respects, improve the quality. But at the same time, it will make reading more difficult for rural people. It is unknowable whether this will make rural people lazy to read or make them work harder. And even if it makes them work harder, it does not seem necessary. For example, the popularity of letterpress printing will increase the power of the complex Song typeface, which is contrary to the use of regular script in elementary school textbooks, not to mention the simplified characters that are being promoted. I once imagined that if the invention of woodblock printing in China had been delayed, and the copying of books had lasted longer, the typeface would certainly not be as complex as it is now. Even if woodblock printing had lasted longer and movable type had been invented later, the current Song typeface would certainly not be used. Now, the invasion of letterpress printing into the countryside has reached its peak, but the Song typeface has already started on its downward path. This may be another hardship for rural people. What kind of books rural people will read in the future is impossible to know now.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Portugal's Greatest Poet, Camões' Life of Ups and Downs by Li Bo <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Some people say: "Portuguese literature has only one poet and one work. The poet is Camões, and the work is his *Lusiads*." Although this is somewhat exaggerated, Camões is truly an incomparably gorgeous and exotic flower in Portuguese literature. His position in Portugal is the same as Shakespeare's in England and Cervantes' in Spain.</p>
<p>Sixteenth and seventeenth century Portugal was not as lonely and withered as it is now. It had a strong navy, it competed for colonies at sea, charging east and west. The taste of a hegemon surpassed England. It was indeed a blood-soaked hero of the primitive accumulation era. It produced brave and fierce pirates, and it also produced the "Lusiads" that sang praises of pirates. This "most powerful sea poem after the Odyssey" (John Macy), which narrates the story of an old pirate, made Camões' name immortal.</p>
<p>In addition to *The Lusiads*, Camões (Luís Vaz de Camões) also has countless poems. His style is very diverse. "They (his poems) correspond to the magnificent ranks and situations of ambition and victory; they are twisted and soft with the charm of flesh; they can wave the whip of satire, play the strings of love that ripple with emotion, rustle under the breeze of the countryside, accompany the surging of the wind and waves, and harmonize with tranquil songs." (Goldberg) What is closest to us is his love for his nation, which is as strong as his love for his lover. He is a noble Poet-Patriot. In our current situation, we need him.</p>
<p>However, the Portugal of the glorious era did not value him. Portugal rewarded its greatest genius with a lifetime of displacement and upheaval. No one knows exactly where and when he was born. We only vaguely know that he was probably born in 1524 and died in 1580. He was the son of a colonial official serving in India. In 1544, he met Catherina, a palace lady of the Portuguese emperor, and fell in love with her. This was the beginning of his tragic life and the beginning of his vibrant singing voice. His pursuit of the palace lady probably caused a break in etiquette, and he was soon exiled from the court.</p>
<p>Conscription did not reduce his frivolity and enthusiasm at all. Just after returning, he repeated the disrespect and was exiled again for the second time. This time, they sent him far away to Africa. Legend has it that on the way to Africa, in the Strait of Gibraltar, he lost his right eye at the hands of Moroccan pirates. A blind eye and poverty made his encounter very similar to Homer's. In Africa, he gained novel experiences that later reappeared in his narrative poems. *The Lusiads* probably started at this time, and he also wrote three plays during this period.</p>
<p>In 1549, he returned to Lisbon. Poverty and a courageous temperament made him join the army. At that time, the Portuguese Empire was stirring up wars everywhere in Africa, Brazil, and India. He was sent to India. But on the eve of going to India, because of some entanglement, he stabbed a royal attendant with his sword. So, when he met his lover for the last time, he heard the pronouncement of his third conscription. In this way, the trip to India was delayed for three years. Later, he was pardoned, and in March 1553, he was officially sent to India. When he left his country this time, he was very sentimental. "Ungrateful motherland, you have not received my bones," he said.</p>
<p>He arrived in Goa (a Portuguese city in India, on the Arabian Sea). This place treated him well at first, but later it opposed him like Lisbon. He "is the mother of despicable villains but the stepmother of loyal people."</p>
<p>Six weeks after arriving in Goa, he participated in an expedition. Later, he also participated in a war with 1,200 people to the Red Sea. Here, we don't need to cover up for him. Under his blind patriotic fervor, his sword emboldened the strong. But this was something that his era could not understand. He loved his country, and he obeyed the destiny of his country. But this enthusiasm did not receive any gratitude. When he returned to Goa, the governor had another falling out with him. He wrote many satirical poems, attacking the malpractices of the civilian officials.</p>
<p>In March 1556, he was sent to China to manage the property of deceased or absent Portuguese. But on the way to China, he was stranded on a desert island in India for two years. Not long after arriving in China, he disagreed with the governor again and was sent back to Goa. On the way, the sea ship broke, and he lost everything. When he landed in Goa in 1560, he expected relief, but a bailiff came to arrest him! He was falsely accused of taking bribes and was imprisoned. At this time, the news of the death of Catherina, the palace lady he had cherished all his life, came. The tragedy of his unfortunate life reached its climax. Lying in this dark corner of life, he only poured out his divine poetic feelings, and many of his beautiful lyric poems were left to us at this time. But "the fields are no longer green, the forests are no longer beautiful. I noticed their luxurious and magnificent colors too late. Nature no longer sends out joyful flower buds." (His own verses) How unbearable was the poet's state of mind at this time!</p>
<p>After being released from prison, he was burdened with debts. He longed for the distant clouds and skies of his homeland. But poverty and illness delayed this wish until 1569–1570. In April, he returned to Lisbon. Sixteen years had been spent overseas. The heroic youth had reached the middle of his life with silver hair. Many old friends died, and his lover died. Lisbon was just a desolate city of sorrow. Only his old and poor mother was still there. The two relied on a little bit of insufficient alms to make a living. Legend has it that a Javanese slave he brought back often begged for food for them on the streets of Lisbon at this time.</p>
<p>In this difficult mire, in 1572, a fresh flower of Portuguese literature that will never wither— *The Lusiads* —grew. Less than eight years later, he died. He suffered three exiles to distant places, one imprisonment, countless sea hazards, drifting on desert islands, hostility from officials, and eternal separation from his lover, as well as attacks of starvation and loneliness. He himself said it very well: "Who has ever heard that on this small stage, like a pitiful couch, fate has played out such great misfortune?"</p>
<p>The high pressure of misfortune occasionally made him utter many sentimental verses: "How easy it is to find a burial place for bones! Any wave of the ocean, any wrinkle of the earth, any sleeping place, foreign land, homeland, can be made into a new tomb for all heroic bodies."</p>
<p>However, the wings of the god of love always fluttered over his head, and the flowing water of the river of life always surged in his chest. As Richard Burton said, he had a "passionate heart" and "heroic hands". In his golden book leaves, he recorded "love, honor, justice, heroic spirit, the trembling of glory", but he did not see much of the mediocre men and women who were neither cold nor hot, neither loving nor hating.</p>
<p>When he sang praises of the brave Portuguese, there were such verses: "You, risking death from all sides, still spread the sound of life until eternity." When crying for his lover: "They are right, your burning thirst, your fanatical love, will never be extinguished by the most sorrowful tears." This is a piece of his confession. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e71">University Days (III) (II) by Theodor Storm, translated by Chen Yin Zhi <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>"A dance?" I asked in surprise. "Who is dancing in this forest?"</p>
<p>"Those university gentlemen!" he replied, with a hint of contempt, noticing my unfashionable clothes. "They are hosting the dance in the alley."</p>
<p>I suddenly remembered receiving a letter from a friend at home, with this kind of hint. We called it the "Magician's Midnight Gathering," "It was so noisy that the sky was dark!" That's what the letter said. I know what it was talking about now, I just forgot the location.</p>
<p>The servant seemed to dislike hearing the name "Magician's Gathering." As I was about to use that name to embarrass him, two young men, university students I didn't know, came up the mountain. They didn't pay any attention to me and sat on the bench by the door, each ordering a beer in a sharp voice and with rude expressions. After the servant left, I heard their intermittent conversation about the dance that night. They chatted while yawning. One of them was clearly a "newcomer," having just enrolled, and seemed to be learning about the dance that night from his older companion. The older university student described the dancers one by one, very succinctly, but in his words, none of the dancers were particularly outstanding. One was the dancing teacher's daughter, and another was the drunk policeman's daughter: with their help, the dance could be held. The other dancers were girls without friends or relatives, who relied on working during the day to make a living.</p>
<p>At this time, I ate my breakfast in silence, feeding a warbler that wasn't afraid to walk around on the slate, pecking at the bread crumbs I dropped.</p>
<p>"You should see the Countess!" the older university student said again, twirling his mustache.</p>
<p>The other one asked a surprised question.</p>
<p>His friend laughed, "That's just a seamstress, Ludwig! But you have to see the way she looks at people with her coldness!—She is simply an angel banished to earth!"</p>
<p>"Why do you call her the Countess?"</p>
<p>"Don't you know, the 'Count of Dirt' took a fancy to her!"</p>

<p>He almost didn't wait for me to agree before picking up the phone and calling the Zhang residence. On the phone, he repeatedly asked her to come out, but she either excused herself by saying that she had guests at this time, or that she had to accompany her mother to the street at that time. Finally, my classmate's face turned red, and he said in a pleading tone that he wanted to introduce her to a very good friend who was leaving today, and only then did she agree to meet at a coffee shop between eight and nine o'clock, not very definitively.</p>
<p>After we had lunch, with half a day before the appointment time, we ran to the British Concession to see a movie. The British Concession was not originally a lively place in Tianjin. There were not many pedestrians on the street at this time, and except for yellow faces, almost all of them were White Russians. The lanterns and decorations of the British shops, preparing to celebrate the anniversary of the British monarch's ascension to the throne tomorrow, could not cover up the desolate scene on the street. The movie theater was even emptier, with only a dozen people sitting, and most of them were White Russian women with blood-red lips. After the movie ended, we slowly ran to the Tianxiang Market and Quanye Market area in the French Concession. In the past, the evening of a metropolis could be seen here, but this time, we didn't feel a bit of hustle and bustle. Even the women with low buns, jade bracelets on their arms, flat embroidered shoes, and oval faces in the style of northern concubines could not be found. Tianjin had indeed changed a bit.</p>
<p>We casually ate dinner in a restaurant and barely managed to wait until seven o'clock, then took a rickshaw straight to the coffee shop to wait for Miss Zhang.</p>
<p>The coffee shop was opened by foreigners. The old-fashioned and outdated chair and table furnishings, the not-so-bright lights, and the dull murals with dark colors told us that this coffee shop was a product of the previous century. At this time, there were no more than ten customers. In one corner, several middle-aged fat men who looked like Jews and White Russians were gathered around a table, playing chess with rapt attention. A thin mist of tobacco was exhaled from them and scattered everywhere.</p>
<p>We ordered two cups of coffee, drinking and talking at the same time. The conversation was naturally centered on Miss Zhang. My classmate told me in a slightly proud tone that it was Miss Zhang who was interested first. Although she had not yet graduated from middle school, she played the piano well and was now hiring someone to teach her Northern School Chinese painting at home. As for her thinking, of course, we couldn't be too demanding, but she could still understand my classmate. Once, my classmate, half-jokingly and half-seriously, scolded her old bureaucrat father, and she didn't get angry. However, she herself felt that it was not good to get engaged without the permission of her family—that is, before my classmate found a job.</p>
<p>My classmate also said that they first met in this coffee shop, and later they often came here. They often went to see movies and dance together, and they had also felt their hearts flutter under the fragrant and strong Kulasso wine…</p>
<p>In the middle of the conversation, my classmate looked at his watch every now and then, and when he heard the sound of shoes, he got up and looked outside. It was half past eight, a quarter to nine, almost nine o'clock, but Miss Zhang's trace was still nowhere to be found. A sound of high heels clearly came in, but it was a Chinese dancer in a red dress who came.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid this time it's a broken appointment," my classmate said as he left the table and went to the front to make a phone call. Just after he left, I caught sight of a young woman in a dark green coat walking in. I guessed that she must be Miss Zhang, and I was about to get up to greet her when my classmate ran in like a fly. After introducing me to Miss Zhang, he quickly took off her coat for her, let her sit next to him, and poured her a cup of black tea. After a few words of greeting, we casually found some topics to talk about: from music and painting to the beauty of the residences and gardens in Beijing.</p>
<p>In the middle of the conversation, I secretly sized her up. She looked about twenty-three or twenty-four years old. A dark green silk robe covered her medium figure. Her hair and lips were not artificially decorated. Her round face with dimples was thinly powdered. Under her slightly furrowed eyebrows were a pair of large and lively eyes. She was indeed worthy of the words "charming" and "intelligent"—especially when she smiled and her eyes moved. Her clear accent was typical of Beijing women. Her speech was fluent and natural. However, when she talked to my classmate alone, the attitude of a spoiled and willful girl was revealed again. From here, you could see her innocence and her feminine pride. For example, when my classmate asked her to make a second appointment, she shook her head and said:</p>
<p>"It depends on my mood!"</p>
<p>When we were talking about how good Beijing was, my classmate said to her!</p>
<p>"Let's go to Beijing to play together?"</p>
<p>"Are we two going? I won't go unless my mother goes." This was her straightforward answer. My classmate hit a snag, and his diplomatic rhetoric was a bit exhausted.</p>
<p>We talked casually like this for a while, and it was almost time for my scheduled train to leave. She politely accompanied my classmate to the station. In front of this silhouette of a pair of lovers in love, I left Tianjin again. I wish them to always keep their dream of love!</p>

<p>Plants bend their branches, stretch out their twigs, or droop their lush leaves, making many strange shapes, all in order to receive more dew and more sunlight. People put on smiling faces, shed tears, crawl on the ground, undress, expose their bodies, and make all kinds of even stranger ugly faces than plants. Why? All for a few coins.</p>
<p>Two people of the same physique and age contract the same dangerous and acute illness at the same time. One hires a doctor, and the other cannot afford a doctor. As a result, one lives and one dies. Everyone can understand: the one who lives is saved by money, and the one who dies is killed by the disease. But if you think carefully, you know that the final decision on life and death rests with money.</p>
<p>Starting from this point, we can know by analogy that the success or failure of a career, the victory or defeat of a war, the suffering of mankind, the status of high and low, and the occurrence of all honor and disgrace are all determined by money.</p>
<p>If someone wants to ask which country in the world understands the function of money best, I will tell you without hesitation: it is the Chinese. The Chinese not only need money when they are alive, but also know that the dead also need money, so they are willing to exchange useful money for underworld silver and paper money, turn it into ashes, and let the dead use it. If this person did not deeply understand the function of money and was extremely intelligent, how could he have thought of it so thoroughly?</p>

<p>"West Lake's famous scenery is unparalleled in the world," "I want to compare West Lake to Xizi…", all the praises of West Lake are stored inside me. Every time I see a landscape photo of West Lake, my mind wanders. Every time I hear a travel talk about West Lake, my heart is moved. The longer it goes on, the more I miss it, thinking that I must go to West Lake in this life, and only after going to West Lake can I be satisfied and not live in vain. Later, I got a chance and went to West Lake. I personally appreciated and comprehended it, and I verified all the exquisite things about West Lake in my imagination—the wonderful things about West Lake. But after I went to West Lake, I felt that I had lost my West Lake—the West Lake that I used to love and never see, miss infinitely, and didn't know how wonderful it was! I regret why I went to West Lake this time. I foolishly abandoned my most mysterious and most beautiful ideal world in vain and destroyed the data that was enough for me to meditate and travel spiritually. I will have no way to get this kind of satisfaction again! I replaced the imagined West Lake with the practiced West Lake, which is really my mistake—the most significant loss in my spirit!</p>
<p>Similarly, a lustful person meets a peerless beauty who meets his ideals. He can't help but be fascinated and dream of her day and night! When he is painstakingly pursuing her, he holds extreme ambitions, is trapped in tense emotions for a long time, yearns for the ecstasy moment, and is immersed in the sweet future—how happy a reservation ticket he has! Once he really gets the flower-like beauty, he loses the center of gravity of lustful thoughts at the same time! Therefore, some people say, "Wife is not as good as concubine…," and finally "getting what you steal is not as good as not getting it."</p>
<p>I hope that everyone will never get the things they most want to get, so that they can always maintain a renewed meaning. This is the real satisfaction. These people are the most intelligent people!</p>

<p>The Spiritual poet Zhao Oubei, together with Yuan Zicai and Jiang Xinyu, stood as three pillars of their time. In his later years, he closed his doors and compiled a book, naturally distancing himself from the world, and he enjoyed a particularly long life. When he was in high spirits and wrote freely, not sticking to patterns, his majestic, beautiful, strange, and unrestrained writing often made readers' hearts wander and their eyes surprised, and they couldn't bear to let go. For example, on poetry, he said: "Poetry cannot be made without hard work, but good places cannot be created with hard work. Occasionally, in places where poetry is unintentional, you can get one or two naturally good lines." Also, "True immortals do not need old alchemy fires, and divine doctors have new prescriptions. Being able to defeat a great enemy is called courage, how can you see growth by challenging dwarves."</p>
<p>He often made sudden and strange thoughts, unwilling to drop a word to the ordinary. For example, the lines about a large ginkgo tree have "Growing on flat ground, not knowing its limits, its intention is to compete with the mountains for height. ... This is also a behemoth among trees, looking down on all the trees as children. If it grows for hundreds or thousands of years, even the heavenly father will be afraid of touching its ribs.…"</p>
<p>His heroic places are like "Hate not borrowing the fire of the ancestral dragon, to burn all the good poems and leave only me. Hate not borrowing the Yellow Tiger's knife, to kill all the talented people and let me be heroic.…"</p>
<p>His humorous places are like ridiculing Wang Menglou for his expensive vegetarianism: "It is like a widow, although not married, specially uses elegant and plain makeup. Clothes are cut with white sleeves, snow-white color; decorations are with white jade, moonlight. Traveling under plum and pear blossoms, claiming to keep her chastity and follow Gong Jiang. I know her heart is not necessarily pure, and she can still be invited into the bridal chamber.…"</p>
<p>His graceful places are like eating lychees: "Skin like a fairy in Gushye, flavor like the plumpness of Yang Guifei. … The old man can't restrain his feelings, and takes off his scarlet silk clothes." Also, "Lady Gan lies in scarlet gauze, and is surprised to see that it is as white as jade when opened. Half fat should laugh at only knowing ghee, fresh and clean and not thinking of meat."</p>
<p>Writing about the flavor of farmhouses: "Dew blooming grapes, fat horse's milk; wind shaking ficus, living dragon scales." Like "Red stems stand upright, just having bones; crape myrtle is afraid of itching, lazy and without skin." Like "Waiting for the waves, horses neighing on the fragrant grass bank; people resting in the cool, speaking in the green willow village." They are all full of new realms.</p>
<p>As for his five-character ancient poems, inspiration is pregnant, strange thoughts overflow, and it is even more like a hundred flowers competing for beauty, and it is too beautiful to pick.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Three Officials Bodhisattva by Rong Yu <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The "Three Officials Bodhisattva" that I am talking about now are not the gold-clad mud sculptures in temples that people worship, but the beggars on the street who beg from door to door and are hated by everyone. Why is there this title? Because these three beggars set off together, begged together, and rested together, just like the "Meng Liang and Jiao Zan" and "Zhang Bao and Wang Heng" in the unofficial history are inseparable, so they have this elegant name.</p>
<p>Once the name of "Three Officials Bodhisattva" spread, their original names were lost and unheard of. Fortunately, they were insignificant beggars, and no one asked them for their honorable names, so they didn't care about this at all. Their begging is like a joint venture company, and you can also say "share blessings and share difficulties." Because no matter if they beg for a cup of leftovers or a bowl of cold dishes, the three of them always divide it equally. If one person is sick, the other two come out to beg, and the sick person also gets a share. This makes the gentlemen in society a little ashamed. Because ordinary people partner to do something; at first, they are very righteous, but later they quarrel over the uneven distribution of spoils, and they are unwilling to take responsibility and also want to break up. Even if you sign a contract and drink blood wine, you will turn your faces, which is really not as good as them! They have been together for one or two years… from when I saw them when I was a child until now, which is not an easy thing.</p>
<p>People say "When people are poor, their ambitions are short." Ordinary beggars can't help but steal when they see that no one is around; but these "Three Palace Bodhisattvas" are as hard as a golden sign and have never done this kind of thing. Moreover, when they arrive at a family's home and see that people are not there and things are placed haphazardly, they will shout loudly to remind you to "be careful," so they also get some goodwill from people, unlike ordinary beggars who are annoying.</p>
<p>The families that have weddings, funerals, and celebrations are good customers for beggars, and the "Three Officials Bodhisattvas" always get the news earlier than other peers. As soon as they arrive, they say a few words of congratulations to the host and then do some light chores for you at the door, such as sweeping the floor and carrying tables and chairs. When people see them being so diligent, they will give them extra money in addition to being full of wine and food!</p>

<p>By Princess Der Ling of Qing, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Relatively distant provinces, such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou, mostly wait for the tributes from various parties to accumulate to a certain number before transporting them to Beijing in one batch, in order to avoid piecemeal delivery. Therefore, many precious things have to be put in the governor's office for ten days or half a month first; but since these things have been designated as tributes to the imperial court, the governor certainly cannot move or steal them. Even if they are deliberately kept for a few more days, it is illegal. However, the governor of Guangdong dared to use various tricks, disregarding the imperial law, and privately hid many famous and precious tributes. After the incident, the officials who had presented tributes had already issued a very long list to clarify the amount of tributes he had embezzled. The people sent by the Empress Dowager to investigate have also confirmed this. So, in a nutshell, the charges against the governor of Guangdong have been fully established!</p>
<p>Since the charges have been established, it is inevitable to discuss how to punish him. This governor was indeed a very trusted minister of the Empress Dowager in the past. Now, suddenly, his crimes have been confirmed, which of course makes the Empress Dowager very sad and heartbroken. Everyone cannot guess how she will punish this traitor. In theory, this punishment should be very severe, but I know that the Empress Dowager is not an exclusively severe person. She is also very kind sometimes. This can be exemplified by the Yellow River flood that occurred more than ten days ago. (376)</p>

<p>When Li Shilian said that bastard word, it was originally a provocation, wanting to provoke Zhang Jiefu to eat him a meal. Things happened to be so coincidental that Yang Wanhua came in from the outside at this time and only heard half of that sentence. He thought that even if Li Shilian was very open-minded, he shouldn't admit that he was that thing himself. Zhang Jiefu was too happy to consider others and laughed: Whether or not Mr. Li is that thing is up to me. When he said these words, there were already some people standing far away in the yard, all smiling slightly. In fact, if these few words of Zhang Jiefu were properly explained, they wouldn't seem to have any insult in them. Because he was saying them so ambiguously, Li Shilian felt like he had nowhere to hide. If there was a crack in the ground, he would have crawled into it. Yang Wanhua saw his face turning from red to purple, his skin swollen with blood, and his eyes almost unable to open. It was not convenient to continue this joke, so he just said: Mr. Li, I am leaving tomorrow, and I am very grateful for your help with many things here. Li Shilian was also unable to find a way to get off the stage, and when he heard this, he laughed: Congratulations, you have jumped out of the fire pit. Have you received the travel expenses? Wanhua laughed: I have the train ticket, but the pocket money along the way is not enough. I think… I will ask a few old gentlemen to help me.

<h3 id="e81">Miscellaneous Notes on the Interesting History of Qihuang by You Aimei <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>There was a schoolteacher in a certain county who had thoroughly studied the art of Qihuang (traditional Chinese medicine), but he was unwilling to practice medicine. Later, after persuasion from relatives and friends, he only treated people for two hours every morning, charging a consultation fee of one hundred cash, and only for servants. Once, a rich young master came to seek treatment because of his reputation, but the number was full. This young master took out a silver dollar and asked him to make an exception for a consultation. Who knew that he would take the money and throw it out the door. The young master was embarrassed, because he was an uncertified Confucian doctor, but he couldn't do anything about it. Although his temper was so strange, his skills were really good. He set a rule that anyone who came to him for treatment was not allowed to report their condition themselves, otherwise he would not treat them. He only needed two fingers to touch the patient's pulse, and he would thoroughly criticize their condition, as if he were counting family treasures. Moreover, his tone was unusually humorous. A certain person, Jia, from Zhagou Village in my hometown, had a phlegmy constitution, but his liver yang was also strong. He had asked famous doctors for diagnosis and treatment, but none of them had a perfect solution, so he traveled hundreds of miles to him for treatment. He only heard him touching the pulse and scolding: "These doctors are really pus-filled! If water comes, burn a fire, and if fire comes, pour a pot of water, how can you remove the roots together?" Later, he was indeed cured by him. Jia also personally saw a person with a food injury who was also seeking treatment there. He also touched the pulse and scolded: "Delicious! Delicious! You ate yourself sick and ran to harm me!" It can really be said to be wonderful people and wonderful words, making people laugh.</p>
<p>There were two doctors in a certain village, living in the front and back of the village; they were both very upright. But they were a little jealous of each other, and the competition was very fierce. If the doctor in the front village did not cure the patient, as long as they came to the back village, no matter what, they would find a way to treat them. Conversely, if the back village did not cure the patient, and they went to the front village, it was the same. Once, two ignorant young people, on the Yuan Festival, suddenly became happy and bet on eating tangyuan dumplings. A ate ten, and couldn't eat any more. B ate ten, and it was also difficult to swallow, but B was very competitive and ate six more, but it was already stuck in his throat.
