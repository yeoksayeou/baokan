<p>— 星</p>
<p>近者·滬上之日本報紙。數載虛構之消息日本之通訊社。亦多有不利於吾國政治領袖之記載。中央社已嚴辭辯正。吾人深覺此類捕風捉影之記載。不但於外交上引起不良之結果。卽就報言的。虛構者於報業道德。亦有所損。更就實際利害而言。報紙之令譽。既因此而受害於讀者間。卽引起不信任之心。吾業以信實爲第一要務。無信不足以自辯。更不足以自存。縱一二報業。因有特殊之政治的及經濟的背景。然報紙依讀者而生存。欺騙讀者。利用讀者。拂怒讀者。則讀者望望然而去。雖有特殊勢力爲其後盾。亦奚益哉。</p>
<p>按此類虛構消息之形成。一方面固因某種報業機關。染有濃厚之色彩。對於其國政府之政策。惟恐完成之不速。對於其國人民之偏見。惟恐迎合之不力。乃不惜以神聖之報業。爲國策推行之工具。爲國民偏見發揮之機。關更有一方面。則在於報業之過分好奇。於每種消息。惟求其離奇而富刺激部分。過度舖張之。以眩惑衆目。平凡消息。雖性質重要。亦等閑視之。刺耳刺目之消息。則雖無關於大體。或僅爲揣測之辭。亦大事鼓吹。以刺激讀者。以表示此報此社之能發他人所未發。故如中日提携。官方之消息也。雖甚重要。亦加忽略。聯俄聯其。虛構之辭也。知其虛構。以其新鮮奇詭。亦大事宣傳之。吾人試思。日本聯合社之記載馬占山之死。甘經幾度而。馬占山固未死也。前月日本方面所發表之關於成都政　消息。無一絲之根據。德如此不尊重報人道德。沾污吾業。不但可惋惜亦深可痛恨也。</p>
<p>報業爲人民之信託水業。亦卽人類文化之信託事業。社會之進步或墮落。國家之或安或危。國際關係之或和平或惡化。報業爲其最大之决定因素。吾人負此信託之責任。　如何慎重將事。克信克誠。使不負此偉大之信託。如因爭一日之短長。而發表禾證實之消息。一家之破。一國之危。國交之破裂。均報人之咎。而　　實白身　　者也。國之泰晤士報。消息往往後於他人而從無來　實之消息發表。紐約世　報會設一「證實部。」卽些小之事。亦數度探　。免有不實之記　。本報六十餘年來。得讀者之信　。亦賴此謹慎精確之精神。善哉。世界報主人潘立查之言日。報人之道德。第一爲正確。第二爲正確。第二亦爲正確。當此宣傳之毒。迷漫世界。報業自由。橫被剝奪。國際間之惡感日增。人類之互相猜忌日甚之際。從事於報業之人。其應知　所勉。而使無愧於此神聖之　業乎。</p>

<p>（巴黎）法國政府於九月十日由駐英大使戈爾平向英國政府提出一問題謂「將來歐洲方面倘有破壞國聯會盟約並訴諸武力之情事、法國是否可確保英國必以有效手段、立卽實施國聯會盟約第十六條所規定之制裁辦法云、對於此項問題已由英國外想霍爾於九月二十六日向法大使戈爾平提出復文、其全文頃由法國外交部發表、復文共分四節、述其大意如下、</p>
<p>霍爾首述九月十一日彼在國聯大會之演說謂「當時余曾宣言、凡屬國聯會會員國均應就其力所能及之範圍、履行國聯會盟約所規定之義務、此心此志、英國政府殊不在他國之後、當時余復謂國聯會盟約所包含之理想、尤其是國際事件、應樹立規範之願望、實與崇尙理想主義之英國民族性不謀而合、英國人民信之彌篤、　假且成爲英國國民意識之一部分矣、」</p>
<p>覆文繼謂、「有人以爲英國過去對於國聯會以及國聯會所主張之一切、並未具有堅定不變之忠實態度、余在國聯大會演說中、曾爲辭以關之、余曾指出英國最近輿論之種種反響、俾令世人注意、英國人民如何萬衆心、爲政府後盾、以完全接受國聯會員國之義務、英國始終以接受此種義務爲其外表政策之基調、固迭經昭吿於世界者也、至於以英國此種主張、此種政策、專爲對意阿爭端而發、係別有用意、則可謂完全出於誤解、而與事實不符、余今乘此機會、重行負責聲明、英國人民所屢經表示採納者、乃係國聯會之原則、初無其他特殊之動機、倘舍此以外、別作其他解釋、是不啻損害英國之良善信仰、懷疑英國之誠信態度、又烏乎可、余所以不憚重言以申明者、國聯會盟約對於會員國義務、本有明確之規定、英國始終當加以支持、並當集體維持盟約之全部條文、而尤要者則對於一切未經挑　之侵略行動、均應加以堅决的集體的抵抗仰余以爲凡屬國聯會員國　對於任何特殊事件均不能預行確定其政策、諸以上所述之數語、更爲明確而堅决、此層當爲一般人之所同意、故上文所謂「一切未經挑釁之侵略行動」、乃係指一般而言、初未指何種特殊事件而言、此層當必均須注意其所包含之完全意義、國聯會盟約第十六條之程序、僅對於「未經挑釁序、僅用以應付積極之行動、反之、對於不能履行條約條文之消極行動、則自不適用之、更進一步而論所謂　訴諸武力一語、其罪惡之範圍侵略之程充、有大小高低之不同、亦甚爲明顯、因此盟約第十六條之採用、其行動性質、當各如其分際、換言之、當視每一特殊事件之環境情勢、而有所殊異、就余所知、法國政府固　承認此種判別矣、</p>
<p>「此外關於倏約義務、余在國聯大會亦曾有所論列、今無妨再加以聲明、余以爲變通性、乃係安全之一部、世界决非靜止不變的　此固爲國聯會盟約所承認、而尤爲國　會員國所當一體承認者也」、</p>
<p>復文至此復謂以上所列舉之原則、乃係代表英國現內閣之政策、至於　國　任內閣是否採取此種政東、則無受拘束之必要「但余在日內瓦所作之演說、雖係代表現政府發言、而實際上則固爲英國大多數人民之所贊助者、余此項演說　要點、乃在支持國際行爲之一般原則、茍國聯會始終成爲有效之組織、則　國此種立塲、亦始終不變、余作此項演說、乃係代表英國人民堅貞不援之感情徵諸最近數星期來英國輿論之態度而益信、尤有進者就英國政府及人民之意見、欲避免過去時代無意義之禍亂、確保未　世界之和平及集體安全、國聯會實爲唯一眞實、　希望、倘因吾人失卻對國　會之信仰、倘因吾人拒絕爲國聯會理想、而作有效之行動、致使國聯會陷於軟弱無能之地位、則不免鑄成大錯矣、抑所謂信仰、所謂行動與安全相同、亦必爲集體的而後可、值此緊急之關頭、余當重述日內瓦演說中之一語、以作結諭、曰「吾人倘爲和平而冒險、亦必須共同以赴之」國聯會倘以身作則、保持其原則、則英國政府與人民當與國聯會之原則、共其存亡焉」云、（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）法國官塲對路透記者表示其對於英國復文之意見、謂吾人完全滿意、複文至爲切實云、（三十日路透社電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）此間報紙對於　體保安問題英國答覆法國之盟會、一致表小滿　報稱英國之照會漏洞甚多、如英外相霍爾認盟約第十六條僅指積極行動、而不能用以制破壞條約之國、則彼僅指出盟約　缺點、日報亦謂　照人失望、英國外部類在規避對法之義務云、（三十日國民電）</p>

<p>楊昨發表感想、其洞如次、「希希望了許久的全運會到了、在黃浦江望見市府巍峨大廈、心便怦怦地動、這次又遇着了各地許多健兒、大家切磋技藝、我感覺全運是摧促全國運動的原動力、余於去年十月已開始練習、以備參加此次全運、然而沒有很特殊的進步、這點是很對不起那些期望我們人們、我希望我能不斷訓練、再求更深的造就、我很感激那些指導及評論我的人們、很多人勸我捨棄、據說一個人到了一個時期、便要脫離、免受人家的打倒、不知在我個人的意思、他人能夠打倒我、那個就是整個游泳界的進步、並且我很希望着這現象的發現、日本首次參加世運時、尚不懂得捷泳的方法、祇會側身泳、但於二十四年時、便有接力泳參加、二十八年巳有高石入江等之優異成績出現、三十二年便獲世界游泳冠軍、</p>
<p>可知日本十二年由游泳進步之速、一日千里、而他們的進步、就是世界舞台的借鏡、若我國能夠派運動員參加世運則將得益不少、全國運動大會、是我國人民所可驕的一會事、因爲在世界上沒一國可有那樣大規模的奧合、美國的全運、也是東美西美中美的會集、這回全運在上海舉行、使外人更知我國日趨於團結了、</p>
<p>簡氏歡宴</p>
<p>全體男女隊員於下午四時正、由新亞出發、至市池試泳以資熟練、下午七時、復應本市僑務局長簡經綸氏、在汀灣雨園之歡宴、被邀作陪者有李大超·簡情曼·葉覜棪·胡桂庚（胡文虎氏代表）·陳子靑·勞敬修·及楊柱南夫婦等十餘人、於九時許散席、楊弟昌華、昨未同來、據楊秀珍語其友人稱、昌華仍在培正小學、恐誤學業、故未同來、陳玉輝因事不及、須二號動身、吾儕之於游泳甚感興趣、故無日不在練習也云云、楊等定今晚八時在市池參加首届港滬埠際賽、</p>

<p>昨日觀衆寥寥、男子第一單打於一時開賽、德孚未出塲、改由柯拉沙代替、柯李兩人球藝　埒、勢均力敵、李惠堂發球犀利、上網亦具功夫、惟底綫長抽不及柯拉沙、第一盤李每以智取、常使用網前切球、使柯拉沙無從追縱、乃以六比四佔先、第二盤李先獲一局、繼連失四局、成四與一之比、柯已佔先、旋李屢次以機　得球、連下五局、逐以六比四　　第二盤滿擬鼓作氣、擊敗柯民、奈第三盤後李失機甚多、竟被柯以六比二、六比三、六比三連勝一盤、乃以三對二結束、柯拉沙在最後三盤中、以底綫猛抽取勝、</p>
<p>女子雙打　表演平平</p>
<p>女子第二雙打、港隊葛麗菲女士球藝平常、招政釗夫人亦頗軟弱、而滬隊柯拉沙夫人、不特發球銳利、其長抽欄網均有可取、推勒夫人克盡厥職、故雙方勢力不均、成一面倒之勢、第一盤滬先得二局、第三局爲港奪回後、即連失四局、滬乃以六比一佔先、等二盤中港隊一路軟化、有失無得、爲滬隊連勝六局、遂以二比零結束、</p>

<p>曾任蘇省長之王瑚，貌端重，性喜詼諧，且應辯敏捷，從馮煥章居太原時，有一四十餘歲之丈夫相隨，每日晨起，恒爲王氏傾便壺，衆疑爲王僕，既而詢之，始悉爲舊屬營長也，衆竊議之，謂不應以此佞長官，而長官亦不應以此役屬下，王氏聞之，因劉衆曰：「公等怪其爲我傾便壺乎？吾與彼分有上下，而誼則朋友，吾亦常爲彼傾便壺，」言畢回顧其人曰：「君謂然否？」其人大笑，衆亦大笑，一時疑團，因一語而冰釋矣。</p>
<p>香港有利欺神街，爲已故富商利欺神之產業，街坊有人擬一聯云：『「利」己損人「斯」貧重富。「神」憎鬼厭「街」知巷聞。』此聯與某生輓康有爲之『國之將亡必有。老而不死是爲。』有異曲同工之妙。</p>

<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>曾膾炙人口的一支小曲「桃花江，現在雖已成爲絕饗了，但是「桃花江上美人多」的印象，怕已很深刻地印在每一個人的腦筋裏了。</p>
<p>據說，桃花江是在湖南的。桃花江上是否多美人，果然不敢武斷，但湖南省因山川靈秀之所鍾，文人俠士，革命偉人之輩出，確是指不勝屈的，而更其是對於近代的革命史，湖南與湖南人，都是佔着很重要的地位的。</p>
<p>可是湖南對於文化，有偉大的關係之外，湖南的鑛產，也是頗值一述的。銻鑛，是湖南的最大的鑛藏。湖南的銻鑛，不只可算在中國蘊藏得最多，在世界，也可居於第一位。湖南的銻鑛，是集中在錫鑛山和益陽附近的。銻這東西，是製造軍火時所少不來的原料，所以在歐戰時，價格很高，倒做了一筆很好的買賣。只是錫鑛山一區所產的，竟每月輸出一千三百噸以上。</p>
<p>湖南的銻鑛，在民國紀元的三年前，佔全世界產銻量的半數。現在，因開掘得努力，已佔全世界產量的百分之八十。銻鑛之外，還大量的生產着鋁，鋅，錳等，在化學工業上，都佔着十分重要地位的金屬鑛。</p>

<p>— 觀亭</p>
<p>友人屈君的祖母，在靑年時代，就喪了所天，可是伊竟養大了三個兒子，活到了八十多歲才死，死時，兒孫達三十餘人之多。</p>
<p>當伊在病危的時候，忽然取出一百個前淸康熙年間的制錢，授給全體子孫媳婦輩傳觀，並且說道：「人生最痛苦的事，莫過於靑年婦女的守寡，你們看了我那一百個大康熙錢，就可以知道守寡的艱苦，我從前每值夜晚覺得心中不安定的時候，總是將那一百個錢，隨手撒在房內地下，然後便去一個一個從黑暗中把它摸起來，直到一個不少爲止，俾使精神疲勞，易於入睡，而忘記一切，這是我數十年來艱苦守寡的唯一的方法。你們不看那一百個康熙錢的每一面，不是都被我的手指磨光了嗎？所以我深知道年靑的婦女守寡，不但是一件極難的事，而且是一伴極殘酷的事。你們應一該記着，以後我家如有年輕的媳婦，不幸喪偶時，切莫勸伊守寡，須知人生幾何，爲了要博得我家可以竪立一座「節母牌坊」的虛榮，竟逼使他人犧牲終身幸福，是極不應該的……」</p>
<p>在現在，所謂貞節」問題，已不爲社會人士所汴重，靑年寡婦，守節的已漸漸地少了。這篇所述的事實，是友人屈君親口吿訴我的，特地記了出來，以見從前處在舊禮教底下的寡婦們守節的痛苦。</p>

<p>然而在事實上，一交秋令，幾十名專門負責照料菊花的園丁，便沒有一個不忙得整天不幹別事而仍不能有片刻的空閑了。譬如灌水，施肥，遷種，遇烈日或大雨便須加蓋蓆篷，雨過後及晚上又必須把蓆篷取下，好讓它們充分的吸收露水；再加那時候還不曾有什麼滅蟲的藥沫發明，於是除蟲的工作又得佔去不少的時間。</p>
<p>能够在菊花上繁殖，並施行破壞工作的蟲類是很多的，而其中尤以擅鑽在花心內恣意搗亂的一種小靑蟲最爲可怕，它們在菊花的蓓蕾未長成以前，梗上祇有綠葉的時候，還是影也不見的，待到那些蓓蕾漸漸長大，差不多就要開花的當兒，他們便不經邀請的闔第光臨了，齊集在花蕊上，日夜的嚼嚙，往往會把一枝上的花全部嚙完。因此在某一個時期內，捕蟲的工作，真是緊張到了極點。二十多名的園丁分爲十來組，每組兩人，一個擊着兩只特製的馬口鐵杯，蹲在地上，專候那另一個把各枝花上的小靑蟲搖落下來，然而祇是搖還不可靠，必須分開花心，細細的搜檢，才能悉數殲來。所以每一枝花都得費上六七分鐘工夫。我們試想；上苑裏一起有三千多盆的菊花，需費多少時間方可全部檢完呢？無怪那些園丁天天要忙得不得空閑了！（四二九）</p>

<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>在半個月前吧，鄙人在春秋上發表了「悼王均卿」一文，曾見沈三白浮生六記發見沈三白浮生六記所缺的「中山記歷」「養生記道」兩種遺作。這篇文字給位問黎庵君瞧見了，周君和幽默大師林語堂是很要好的，語堂正爲天下月刊用英文迻譯那浮生六記，便把這事吿訴了他，他得了這個消息，狂喜不勝，約我到他的寓所去一叙。</p>
<p>這天，霏微而雨，秋意益復酣足，乘一路公共汽車到憶定盤路下來，我那四十三號A的門牌，走過了二三十家門面，纔見一條很幽蒨的徑道，兩旁夾植許多樹木，高高矮矮地，蟬兒棲息其間，發着聯續性的鳴噪，循徑直入，右折末一家，便是林先生的寓所了，草木環擁着一座歐式的樓屋，靜悄悄的沒有些兒聲響，由閣者導入，在那書室裏憇坐，黎庵君說：「林先生現在文化社，一會兒便來，」鄙人舉目四矚，都是整列的書册，中文英文，各佔半數，中文書中，大都是詩文筆記等類，更有許多爲時代靑年束諸高閣斥爲陳腐的經史，鄙人因問黎庵君：「林先生平日對於新舊文學見解如何？」黎庵君說：「林先生容新納舊，絲毫沒有偏見，可是最反對那些歐化的文字，目爲文學界的蟊賊，」說到這兒，林先生回來了，穿着件白紡綢的長衫，年事約在四十左右，很誠懇和靄地，和鄙人握手，寒暄了幾句，便引到他著作的一間小室裏，小室榜有葉恭綽所書的「有不爲齋一橫幅，那書桌上筆墨咧，圖書咧，函札咧，茗箋咧，幾乎堆滿了，他就從書堆裏抽出一本有正書局出版的雁來紅雜誌給鄙人瞧，說：「這上頭按期載着浮生六記，不知道在這刊載之前，有沒有他種刻本？鄙人回答他：「浮生六記當初祗有抄本，被王均卿發見了，很欣喜地給他的朋友黃摩西閱覽，摩西適輯雁來紅，便把這稿被露行世，後來王均卿輯說庫，又把牠搜羅在內，於是益廣流傳，」林先生又問：「那所缺的兩記，究在何處！是否可以探索？」鄙人說：「稿在均卿處，自均卿故世後，不知何人保存，容待函詢，」他說：「兪平伯標點的六記，有著者沈三白的山水畫，幷誌有沈的墓塋，在西跨塘福壽山，很想携了攝影機到吳中去，一尋沈的墓道和故宅，」鄙人說：「吳中素有保墓會，墓迫諒可探訪，惟那故宅，則人事變遷，址跡興廢，據沈記所說的初居滄浪亭畔咧，繼徙倉米巷咧，恐父老輩也難指定的了，」這時已餚熟飯香，林先生便請鄙人進膳，同席的除林先生黎庵君外，還有兩位女公子，他的夫人出外購物去了，餚有多色，俱爲閩式，一大盎的淸湯田雞，異常鮮雋，據說是林先生最合口胃的，每進一菜，林先生必問着傭僕，爲太太留了些沒有，可見林先生的伉麗情深。俄而他的夫人還來了，經林先生的介紹，和鄙人握手，然後重行入席，林先生一壁吃飯，一壁還披覽一册聖蹟圖，，仲尼有一張一弛之說，他便笑着說：「人家說幽默足以亡國，試問倘使一天到晚廿四小時無時無刻不憂國憂民，那麼其人豈不變成瘋子，難這瘋子可以救國麼，聖人的所謂張弛，也就是調節之道哩，」飯罷，他又把浮生六記翻檢了一回說：「書中有一人名鴻千，也有作鴻干的，不知究屬是千抑是干！因爲譯音方面，很有關係的，」鄙人說：「這雖無從證考，但就字面講，千字平聲，叫得響，當以千字爲宜，」林先生也以爲然，又問：「書中所述及的橫塘咧，南園咧，王廢基咧，萬年橋咧，醋庫巷洞庭君祠咧，至今尙存在否？有否花照遺俗？」拉雜又談到獅子林，他說：「數年前曾游過一次，覺得其中的布置，未免失之於俗，但是獅子林的一木一石，都是經名手栽疊的，不敢妄加譏評，及瞧見了浮生六記有云：「獅子林雖曰雲林手筆，且石質玲瓏，中多古木，然以大勢觀之，竟同亂堆煤，積以苔蘇，穿以蟻穴，全無山林氣勢，以予管窺所及，不知其妙」沈三自竟先獲我心，不得不令人佩服，既而林先生說：「我國的小品，可介紹至西洋的，浮生六記外，尙有幽夢影一書，現正預備迻譯哩，」鄙人知道林先生擔任五處的編輯，是很忙的，不敢躭擱他工夫，便告辭而出，他送至門前，還殷殷的訂後約呢。</p>

<h3 id="c205">常識的倫理觀與山本有三 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 張香山</p>
<p>由於嬰兒殺害這篇戲劇，山本有三在我國倒成了一個極熱識的劇作家了，實在，山本有三在日本的劇作家裏，也是個極卓越的人物。</p>
<p>在日本，能稱爲劇作家的，實聊若晨星，像久保田萬太郎，吉井勇，正宗白鳥，谷崎潤一郎以及獨幕劇的能手菊池寬等，大都是小說作者或歌者，其眞正能稱爲劇作家的，祗有岡本綺堂岸田國士和山本有三幾個人吧了，其中像岡本綺堂的存在，一半還是封建的歌舞伎的，而山本有三則不然，他承了大正時代的自然主義風氣，着重於現實的日常生活的表現；並由於他的劇的持有緊凑的構成，獲得非常的好評，因此，有人評之謂酷似易卜生，實在不算甚過評吧。</p>
<p>他的作品，可以說是一貫的連織着常識的倫理觀，這地方，因此他不能離開了所謂膚淺的「道德感」。他是只以這種常識的倫理觀來處理並應付現實社會，並且他只能發見現社會的缺乏這種常識的倫理觀，却不能更深一部去抓取結癥的所在處；就以我們熟知的嬰兒殺害來爲例吧，就可以明瞭了山本有三的常識倫理觀的全豹。</p>
<p>嬰兒殺害的故事是這樣的：一個警察小山，爲了貧窮，無法醫治妻和兒子的疾病，終於讓妻兒亡去，於是寂寞地和女兒二人過着苦難的生活。，這時候，他是深感到了妻兒的死，是由於給自己殺害的，因爲自己無錢來醫治他們。</p>
<p>這時，有個拉土的女工人，將自己的嬰孩殺害掩埋了，但終於被人發見，後來這女人到小山處來陳情，小山怒責其喪害無辜的生命，欲綑毆之，但待女人訴說了為養活家裏的大小人口，不得不殺死這困覊她不能做工的嬰孩，並日以爲這孩子與其在世上受苦，不如死了干净的話以後，乃大加同情並且安慰她說：「在法庭裏，這罪也許能酌量情形，給猶豫執行的。</p>
<p>從上述這段故事裏，我們可以看到了幾個顯著的事實，第一是小山這人物是山本有三的思想之整個代表者，也就是充滿了濃厚的倫理觀和道德感。第二，女工人的殺死嬰孩是非常常識的事件，第三，認現社會的法律，還保護着這些可憐的人們。</p>
<p>作者所描寫的小山這個中心人物，其摯戀死去的妻兒，忠於職務，並且對於女兒的那種柔和的心氣，而且對犯人的初忿怒而後加以慰恤的行爲，可以說是一幅最善良的最道德的人間之圖。然而這種人間楚否眞存在於這個世間呢？倒是一個最大的疑問，不用說，這是作者的思想的壘堆，是把許多抽象的常識的倫理觀，想具體地表現在這個人物上。</p>
<p>至於殺害嬰兒這種械常識的現象，實是一個不普通的事實，山本有三雖然認識了這種社會讓產生這種悲劇的不當，但同時他還執信於維持現社會的法律的道德性。易卜生的諸問題劇，一方面固然提出夾許多問題，一方面對現社會也是抱着懷疑和不信任的，但山本有三却不然，他祇寫出來這個社會的若干不合理的悲劇，但他還信任社會之能合理化，並且他還相信他的倫理觀所堆成的人物之存在。</p>
<p>在這裏，不妨再舉生命之冠來做例，這篇戲劇的大概是這樣的：一個開製蟹肉罐頭工廠的商人，接受了英國的一般直接訂購的賣買，因此惹起了介紹業的貿易商的妬忌，起來豐斷他們的製蟹，方法是讓捕蟹商提高蟹價，這樣使這工廠商折本；於是這工廠商的弟弟就决定來購買小蟹和雌蟹等便宜蟹，來混雜摻製，免得折本，可是做哥哥的絕不肯做這種欺騙的行爲，因爲認爲這與商人的道德和日本的商業聲譽有碍的緣故，結果忍心購買高價的蟹，以致破產，擕病妻弟妹，離開這座已經買給別人的屋子工廠而去。</p>
<p>這是個悲劇，是個忠實的執守常識的道德的人之沒落，不用說，在作家的意圖中，是攻擊現世的虛偽奸劣，但同時還執信於：『能保持永遠的誠實，我能給他這頂生命的光榮之冠」。這也就是他信仰着這種倫理的觀念，無論遇到如何的困難的和失敗，但終於還能獲得這最後的生命的榮冠。這種思想，構成了山本有三戲曲的眞生命，同時也表現出山本有三的落伍性。</p>
<p>最後，我得提出他劇的優點，和他的方法，所謂他的優點和方法是什麼呢？是他能從各角度來觀窺一個事象，並知道來捉住作爲各個關係的組合之一個事象：從單純的事物裏，來窺複雜的構成，並且知道日常生活是含有比異常的事更有意義，這可以看他的長篇小說「波」，就能明瞭；其他一點，就是他的劇的構成的緊凑，由於這緊湊，帶來了他劇的整個的效果。</p>
<p>至於他的著作，還有同志的人們津村教授等等；小說還有篇獲得非常好評的「女的一生」！這小說與莫泊桑女的一生有若于相同處；不用說莫泊桑的女的一生的長處，據大托爾斯泰說，是具有了第一：作者和題材的正當的關係，亦即道德的關係。第二表現的的確和美（此一者是一致的）第三誠實，換言之就是對於所取理的題材之無偽的愛的感情。而山本有三的女的一生，也由於他的着重於道德的關係並同樣是用自然主義的方法，因此也獲得了相當的威功，但據谷川徹三說，「這小說的成功，一半是由於他的戲曲的緊湊的平法，移植到小說裏來的收穫」。</p>
<h3 id="c206">蟻命 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 稜磨</p>
<p>爲蒼蠅的生命可惜，大概將受到應得的嘲笑的。實在我自已，也並不忘記那一條古老的故事：夏天的蟬，在樹枝上愉快地唱着歌，不慌螞蟻爲什麼在那樣大熱的天裏鎮日忙着，到冬天螞蟻借他預儲的糧食生存，而蟬則餓死在道路。這樣，這蟬的死不僅是輕於鴻毛，而簡直輕得連牠自己的翼也比不上。這教訓的意義，就是教我們知道蟬的該死。然而我却覺得費這樣大的勁來解釋蟬的死不足惜，到底還是把這件死看重了的，實在就是這故事中所稱揚的蟻，其死亡在人看來，也就只是一條蟻命。</p>
<p>雖然在作寓言的心情下，在時連花與草，木與石，也顧賦與以生命，但人　是始終都有獨佔生命機能的欲望的，宇宙問多一種具有生命的東西，人知就覺得其自己所應享受的特權，多受了一重剝奪。以之人類時時就在做着否認其他的生命，毀滅其他在生命，蔑視其他的生命的工作。是微小的天忍是最　視　　，　　　　，也盡力把牠們看小，所以在打獵者看來，無論飛禽走獸都只是幾個蟲蟻。這一切都是可蔑視的生命，都不妨毀滅盡淨。固然也有人擔憂，如果世界到除了人類沒有的生命的一天，將會是一個極無趣的世界，可是住在沒有猛獸，沒有蛇蝎侵擾的都市中人，怕沒有一個不希望將來連一隻蒼蠅，一隻臭蟲也沒有的。雖然這僅是對可敵視的生命的態度，至於對可玩賞的生命，當不完全一樣，不過所差也正有限，人類對於完全在自已控制下的生命，並不大承認其生命的存在，而且早準備在發現他們可　惡時，隨時把他們毀滅。</p>
<p>人類積下萬千年毀滅其他生命的歷史，而現在還留着許多未被毀滅的生命，可說只是偶然。這些生命的　能存在，　因爲人類自己的步　走得頗有亂，人類自己不會　認識人類是一樣的人類。大家都自以爲是洪水後　存的正　，自己的辛存，是　爲具有可贊美的性質，至於帶著罪惡的，則只　在洪水中毀　。希望世界上再來一次　水　想　，藏在　部人的心中，是不用說的，還有些人簡直希望具有神樣的力，也改造一次世界。歐戰前的所謂世界文化以及現在所有　純亞黎安血統」的口號，都蘊含着一部人類會被毀滅的危險。用過去的事實比較，知道道也不是荒唐的　慮。過去早已有許多人的毀滅，代替了蟲蟻的毀滅，現在還甚至有人幻想，人類許會自己弄得全個毀滅　讓將眾的世界是媽蟻的世界。</p>
<p>這裏可並不想說，人類該放棄其自相毀滅的動作；用全付的力量去對付　蟻。將來是螞蟻的世界的推想，畢竟也只是寓言。寓言裏每有教訓，但教訓每每不定是好的。古老的寓言相新生　寓言，實際是同一　　，　指示人怎樣維持其生命。而人類實對這已太　熟習了，所以才走是相當遠的歧路，就回到出發點，也未必不重走向歧路　。避免人類的毀滅，或消除蔑視其他生命的心理，也　必　的。然則我們相信萬物與我並育而不相害的老話嗎？自然不，只　。不至時　着　害</p>

<p>— 葉紫</p>
<p>一個月之前，當我的故鄉完令沉入水底的時候，我接到我姊姊和岳家同時的兩封來信，報告那里災疫盛行，兒童十有九生瘧疾和痢疾，不幸傳染到我的兒子身上來了。要我趕快寄錢去求神，吃藥；看能不能有些轉機。孩子的病症是：四肢氷冷，水瀉不停，眼睛不靈活，……等等。</p>
<p>我當時沒有將來信給我的母親和女人看，因爲她們都還在病中。而且，我知道：水災里得到這樣病症，是决然不可救治的。</p>
<p>我將我的心兒偷偷地吊起來了！我背着母親和女人，到處奔走，到處尋錢。有時，便獨自兒躲到什麼地方，朝着故鄉的黯淡的天空，靜靜地，長時間地沉默着！我慢慢地，從那些飛動的，浮雲的絮片里，幻出了我們的那一片汪洋的村落，屋宇，田園。我看見整千整萬的災民，將葉片似的肚皮，挺在堅硬的山石上！我看見畜生們無遠近的飄流着！我看見女人和孩子們的號哭！我看見老弱的，經不起　折的人們，自動地，偷偷地向水里邊爬！滾！……</p>
<p>我到處找尋我的心愛的兒子，然而，我看不見。他是死了呢？還是仍舊　在那些病港的，垃圾堆似的，憔悴的人羣一起呢？我開始埋怨起我的眼請來。我使力的將牠睜着！睜着！我用手巾將牠擦着！終於，我什麼都看不出：烏雲四合，雷電交加，一個巨大的，山一一般的黑點，直向我的頭上壓來</p>
<p>我的意思一恢復，我就更加明：我的孩子是無論如何不會有救的！他也和其他的災民一樣，將葉片似的肚皮挺在堅　的山石上，哭呌着他的殘酷的媽媽和狠心的爸爸！</p>
<p>我深深地悔恨：我太不應該僅僅　了生活的艱困，而輕易地，狠心地將他一個人孤零零地拋在故鄉的。現在如何了呢？如何了呢？……啊啊！我怎樣才能夠消除我的深心的譴責呢？</p>
<p>也許還有轉機的吧！趕快寄錢吧！我的心裏自寬自慰的想着。我極力地裝出了安閑鎮靜的態度來，我一點都不讓我的母親和女人知道。</p>
<p>一天的下午，我因爲要出去看一個朋友，離家了約莫三四個鐘頭，回來已經天晚了。但我一進門——就聽見一陣銳聲的，塲痛的嚎哭，由我的耳裏一直刺入到心肝！我打了一個踉蹌，在門邊站住了。我知道，這已經發生了如何不羣的事故！我的身子抖戰着幾乎縮成了一團！</p>
<p>我的母親，從房裏突然地撲了出來，扭着我的衣服！六十三歲的老人，就像喝醉了酒的一般，哭啞她的聲音了！她罵我是狠心的禽獸，祇顧自己的生活，而不知愛惜兒女！甚至連孩子的病信都不早些告訴她。我的女人匍匐在地上，手中抱着孩子的照片，口裏噴出了黑色的血污！我的別的一個，民經有了三歲的女孩，爲了駭怕這突如其來的變亂，也跟着哇哇地哭鬧起來了！</p>
<p>我的眼睛朦矓着，昏亂着！我的呼吸緊促着！我的熱淚像脫了串的珠子似的滾將下來！我並不顧她們的哭鬧，就伸手到檯子上去抓那封濕透了淚珠和血滴的凶信：</p>
<p>「……沒有錢醫治，死了！……很可憐的，是陰歷七月二十七日的早晨！……這里的孩子死得很多！……大人們也一樣！……這里的人都過着鬼的生活，一天一天地都走上死亡的路道了！………」</p>
<p>眼睛祇一黑，以後的字句便什麼都看不出來了。</p>
<p>夜深時，當她們的哭聲都比較緩和了的時候，我便極力地忍痛着，低聲地安慰着我的女人：</p>
<p>「還有什麼好哭的呢？像我們這樣的人，生在這樣的世界，原就不應該有孩子的！有了就有了死了就死了！哭有什麼裨益呢？孩子跟着我們還不是活的受罪嗎？我們的故鄉不是連大人們都整千整萬的死嗎？饑寒，瘟疫！……你看：你纔咳出來的這許多血和痰！………」</p>
<p>我的女人朝着我，咬了一咬她那烏白色的嘴唇，睜着通紅的眼；絕望地，幽幽地說：</p>
<p>「爲什麼呢？我們爲什要遭這樣的苦難呢？我們的孩子！我們的故鄉！……」</p>

<p>——那眞不妙。你忍容了什麼呢？不要向我說那些漂亮的話。請你爽爽直直地告訴我吧。用你的錢請了個律師，你就有了一種特權可以將自己大部分的私事告訴他。你不要記住我們是老朋友，只須記着我是你的律師。此外，你毋庸對我說其他的話了，像你這樣的事，從坐在那張椅子上的丈夫們的口中，我已經聽到止五十　以上了。你以爲世界上祇有你一個人才和妻子不睦嗎？</p>
<p>——隨你喜歡什麼我都可以打賭的，你從來就沒有聽過像我這樣的一樁案件。我可以把它弄個淸楚，倘你給我知道的時候。</p>
<p>——好，那麼聽我說，你從來可聽到一個女人向她的丈夫說：「自然給她那樣的一種特別的天性，使人們要和她講愛而她反而視爲一種罪惡而不去行使的道埋。</p>
<p>——那是她要你和她講愛的關係啊。</p>
<p>——是的：她曾經那樣地做過；幷且說那是多好的，她已經使我長進了許多，現在她還想這樣地幹下去夾使其他的人們長進。她說這好像一種天資來教養孩子一樣，婦人們誰有了這種天資，她說，和辦學與教育一樣。她們對於此道如此精明，所以對於她們自己的孩子是漢不關心而去追求旁人的孩子。就在這同一的路上，她主張，一個女人應用那種天資的愛來使人們長逸，應該是多多地，幾倍以上的人們底長進。你覺得怎樣？</p>
<p>律師稍有點兒同感，說。。</p>
<p>——個中向有道理呀，你曉得。</p>
<p>——什麼？</p>
<p>——自然我的意思是關於理性上面的。其實那樣的事是不可能的；然而這也幷沒有什麼惡意。關於此事，我感覺很　找到一個適當的辦法。</p>
<p>——那就是她所說的話啊。</p>
<p>——嗨，那麼你怎樣對她說哩？</p>
<p>——我對她說，這重底正當的解决是：她自己應該要害着。</p>
<p>——那樣說會有什麼好處嗎？</p>
<p>——沒有什麼好處。</p>
<p>——她已經不喜歡了你嗎？</p>
<p>——不。她報她　繼續實行和我擕手，但對於我已經發生厭倦了，所以必須有一種新的興味在她的生命裏生長起重才行。現在，你向你的對手怎樣說呢？</p>
<p>——我的對手！我為她　　過一句話嗎？</p>

<p>— 斐兒</p>
<p>小城堆滿了古舊的東西，砌上了封建遺物。—人在小城里住久了，是會染上了一身霉臭的。</p>
<p>小城里的人是近視的，他看不見遠點的事物，他不打理身外的雜事。成日里爲身家與生活奔忙，成日里計算着針般大小的身邊的瑣事。</p>
<p>小城只是孤零零的小城；牠與全世界無關，牠也與全人類無關的。</p>
<p>只有小城里一隻狗與另一隻狗打架，一只猪生出了十二隻小猪，那才會被城里人注意的。</p>
<p>因此小城里有士皇帝，他的權力超過世界上任何種帝王；因此小城里也有永世的愚夫，他的運命注定是永世不能翻身的蠢員。</p>
<p>小城里人讀的書是笑林廣記，染着麼登氣的便讀論語；小城里人讀的小說是七劍十三俠，新式才子佳人則讀啼笑姻緣或張資平式的小說。</p>
<p>偶然一陣風吹來，小城便整個兒騷動了。於是動亂，糾紛，打架，槍殺，甚或至復仇，然而風吹過，小城又歸平靜，像數千年沈靜無波的古井一樣。</p>
<p>於是小城里的人又在一個窄小的洞穴里鑽營：像糞蛆般，你爬上我的身上，我爬上你的身上。</p>
<p>小城的搖搖欲墮的架子，等待第二次的巨風吹來，便可全部倒塌了。</p>
<p>一度的小城小住，我如是感覺；一切古老的小城，我都作如是觀。</p>
<p>這意思幷不是我在稱讚大城。</p>

<p>— （金月章）</p>
<p>隙駟不留，尺波電逝，溯我培明女子中學成立以來，不覺物換星移倏忽已十閱春秋矣！　人等欣逢紀念盛典，追維過去締造之艱難，　擬今後進展之方案，謹將十年來校務沿革之　過，爲邦人一略陳之：</p>
<p>一言設備：本校校舍，地址凡經三次遷移，十四年秋創設伊始，租上海市麥根路新橋東民房，樓上下僅三締耳。十八年一遷至新橋西麥根路三十二號，稍加擴充，仍不敷應用。十九年別租武定路二十號爲小學部校舍，二十年　增闢麥根路校址，乃將小學遷回。直逮二十二年度，方覓得麥根路二百十號新址，斯有此清幽之林園，軒敞之敎室，廣闊之操塲，整潔之宿舍，爲數百學子藏息休遊之所。至於內部之充實，亦有足述者，如圖書之購置，儀器之增添，校具之設備，亦俱應有盡有，則今日展覽所陳列於觀眾之前者，亦燦然略有可觀矣。</p>
<p>二言員生：十四年開學之初，初中小學各衹一級，學生僅四十餘人。明年，兩部各加一級，人數亦卽倍增。又明年，添辦高中，學生視前較進，本校學級至是始臻完備。從此學生入學者與年俱增，今日乃達四百餘人之數。敎員則由五六人增至三十餘人，並國內外專門大學畢業，熱心訓導，孜孜惟敎這之是務。歷任職員類皆經騐宏富忠於職守，競競謀校務之改進。故能通力合作，羣策羣力，共謀發展，有今日之基礎也。</p>
<p>三言學生成績：本校訓育，素以培養醇朴之學風，　鍊刻苦之精神，爲惟一職志。對於學生學業，平時審密考查，學生學年試騐，尤主嚴格，故學我純良，成績優美。全市演講，屢得錦標，會考結果，亦獲優勝。計畢業生考入國內著名大學者佔百分之四十有奇，服務社會者佔百分之五十。凡是皆有統計可稽，不難按表冊而得其姓氏，因能引起社會人士之重視，交口稱譽，豈同人始願所敢及哉？</p>
<p>四言將來計劃：我國興辦女學，迄今四十餘年，其間所造就，亦至夥願；領家庭生活，未見改良，社會風氣，日趨頹　，致整個民族國家，陷於風雨飄搖之境，一時無術振拔！此其原因，雖非一端，而敎育制度之不適，則爲顯見之事實。當世學者謀復興民族，因訟言生產敎育，急圖袖救，蓋以今後女子，必須從敎育上獲得正確之智識及健全之技能，方能與男子共同戮力於社會生產事業，謀國民經濟之發達也。本校有鑒於斯，爰於十八年度，增設高中師範科一級；其後四年，又增設商科一級。現以部章師範科應歸國情，遂告結束；而商科三級則已完成。將來更擬就能力所及，次第擴充農工職業等科，期造成生產人材，供社會應用。此同人所懸爲今後之謁的者也。</p>
<p>綜上所述，本校以十年有限之期間，樹今日比較完備之規模，實由同人犧牲其心力體力，慘淡經營而得之結果，方能傳得社會之贊許與協助，故十六年度繼由校董曾呈准本市敎育局立案，同年度又得敎育部批准備案，歷次視察員蒞校，認爲滿意。此則同人於紀念日歡欣鼓舞之餘，所益思涬勘奮發，謀有邁進其貢獻社會之使命者也。至於全校行政組織，及各級學科編製，悉依部章辦理，故略而不述，述其　營諸大端如此。</p>

<p>學校之使命，在敎與育：敎育之能事；在能按照各階段學生身心發展之程序，繼續施以適宜之訓練，以啓迪其德智諸端，以適應其生活環境之需要。吾校創設，忽忽已屆十年，畢業學生，雖有八百，顧十年之中，對此能事，究竟做到幾許？則殊未能自知，亦殊未敢自滿，禮曰：「繩墨誠陳，不可欺以曲直」，敎務訓育之實况，固吾校之繩墨也，謹誠陳斯二者之梗概於次，並附今後改進計畫於末，幸邦人君子一垂鑒焉。</p>

<p>上海培明女中學校十週年紀念</p>
<h3 id="c215">（甲）敎務 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>一　學級之編制</p>
<p>本校分高初中及小學三部，高中復分設商科普通科，初中三班，高中商普兩科亦各三冊，計中學九班，小學六年級，四敎室，初中之設在謀適合個性之職業，並培養升入高級中學之程度，高中普通科則以升入大學本科爲主旨，商科則以研究經濟原理培養商業實用人才爲主要目標，小學則以養成良好公民及從事初級職業與進初中爲目的。</p>
<p>二　課程之配列</p>
<p>本校初中部高中普通科暨小學各級課程之分配排列，悉遵部頒中小學課程標準，至於商科課程標準，敎部尚無規定，故本校商科課程，大半參酌滬市各著名商科學校所開課程編訂而成。</p>
<p>三　敎材之選擇</p>
<p>本校各級所用敎材，除一部分商科目暨藝術科目編訂　義以外，大部分皆採用敎部審定之敎本，惟於選擇之際，竭力謀各學科之銜接聯絡暨敎學效能之增進，學期始末，敎務處必與敎師幾經商榷方始决定。</p>
<p>四　課業作品之查閱</p>
<p>本校各部各科除於課內注意講習演算外，對課業作品之查閱，更復十分嚴格，事先分別科目訂有精密之計畫，至期收集評閱，毫無寬　，譬如國文一科之課業作品，即有讀文筆記簿，作文簿，日記簿，及習字簿四種，英數理商算簿記各科，皆有練習簿，更地商業各科皆有筆記簿備查閱。</p>
<p>五　成績之考核</p>
<p>本校考核學生學業，參合平日積分月考學期試騐三項成績評爲學期成績。平日積分依敎援時問答與練習課業作品之優劣，製作品之精　爲準，月考時間，由敎務處指定起迄週次，即在授課時間內舉行，至於學期終了之學期試騐，則由敎務處排定日程，編號會考，以一學斯所授全部敎材作一總測騐。</p>
<p>六　自修之輔導</p>
<p>每週除星期六外，每晚皆有自修二小時，由各級導師分別在各級敎室內監督指導，各科重要敎員，並請留宿校內，俾便學生隨時詢問。</p>
<p>七　缺席之統計</p>
<p>本校爲考核學生成績之進步計，對學生缺席統計方法極爲注重，每日均由擔課敎師逐節點名，並於下課後將缺席學生姓名分別報告各級導師，每星期末敎務處即憑此填表比較各級勤惰，遇有缺席過多之學生，即隨時予以勸導或懲罰。</p>
<p>八　演講之訓練</p>
<p>本校對於演講一端，素極注重，間週敦挽社會名流蒞校演講一次，以資觀模，復間週舉行演講會一次，逐次抽籤若干人，先期練習，屆時決取優勝者二三人，並於每學期末舉行總决賽一次，以故來校半年後之同學，皆能口操國語，對眾發表意見，並歷獲上海市各種重要演說比賽優勝，迄爲滬上人士所稱道。</p>
<p>九　時事這重視</p>
<p>本校爲倡導同學留心讀報，時時對國際新聞，國家行政，加以密切注意計，每星期由各級導師輪流在紀念週時解釋每週重要時事之經主其意義一次，並於第學期舉行時事測騐一次，屆期分級舉行，以比例計分，分級計算成績，評定甲乙。</p>
<p>十　會文之舉行</p>
<p>自二十年度起，本校每學期皆舉行會文一次，全校國文敎師先期各命題一則，會文前一小時臨時會議决定題目，會文卷由國文敎師調級評定，每級先抽選五人，然後再於初選試卷各五名，舉行迄今，興趣均極濃厚。</p>

<p>中學女學生適在青年時期，爲人生之黃金時代，此時其身體發育之迅速，理智之增加，感情之興奮，社交之衝動，自我之表現，均達極點。勢必注意其自然興趣，予以平均發達之機會，勿使有危險之傾向，然如何因勢利導，如何先機防閑，更如何事後糾正，在在均非易事，所以訓育問題最爲困難。本校訓育由多數敎職員共負其責，而以訓育主任總其成，且與學生通力合作，以冀養成「建設自己之各個自治學生。」</p>
<p>（一）訓育標準—本校訓練大綱以德智體羣四育爲主，並參酌時代之需要，擬定六大目標，旨在發揚我民族固有美德—忠孝仁愛信義和平，茲分列於後：</p>
<p>1力戒懦怯茍安，養成勇敢奮發之精神。</p>
<p>2力戒倚賴敷衍，養成自立負責之能力。　　3力戒輕躁盲從，養成審慎周密之思考。</p>
<p>4力戒浪漫奢糜，養成刻苦勤樸之習慣。</p>
<p>5力戒虛僞渙散，養成精誠團結之意志。</p>
<p>6力戒自私自利，養成愛國愛家之觀念。</p>
<p>（二）操行成績之考查</p>
<p>學生操行成績之考查，除訓育人員外全體敎職只均負考查之責，依據所擬訂之目標，隨時隨地觀察其平日活動情况，就疏理性情與行爲各方面有事實上之表現者，分別紀載於操行考查簿中，至學期終了時，分別彙集，評定優劣，報告家長，平日如有性行不良及犯規記過情事，除紀錄於操行簿外，並隨時通知家長交相訓戒，以期改善。</p>
<p>（三）獎懲辦法之規訂</p>
<p>本校各種比賽，如演說測騐均注重團體獎，所以喚起合作精神，捐除自私觀念，至對於敦品力學服務勤懇之學生，則仍獎個人，略分獎狀及獎學金兩種，學生學業操行體育成績經評定後，有特殊之優良者，發給獎金，此外如各項功課及格，品行優良，無長期時間告假者，發給獎狀。</p>
<p>懲戒分訓誡，記過及開除學籍數種：凡學生有犯規行爲，或對於學業不努力上進者，　則予以告誡使之覺悟，稍重則記過示警，最重者則開除學籍，其要項如下：</p>
<p>1品行惡劣者。</p>
<p>2身心不健全或患傳染病者。</p>
<p>3屢經懲戒仍不悛改者。</p>
<p>4規避學期考試者。</p>
<p>5考試舞弊者。</p>
<p>6侮辱師長者。</p>
<p>7違犯校規情節重大者。</p>
<p>8行爲不檢有損校譽者。</p>
<p>（四）訓育實施—本三民主義之精神，師生合作之原則，以冀思想系統化，行爲紀律化，造就學生爲健全之公民，以積極訓導爲主。</p>
<p>（甲）積極方面可得而言者，有下列數端：</p>
<p>1設各級導師—本校導師以學級爲單位，指導各該級課外作業及級會事宜之進行，以期發展自治能力，有時灌輸以處世立身之道，以期養成有用之人才。</p>
<p>2成立各級級會—由校中擬定級會組織簡章，在導師指導之下成立各級級會，各級會均選舉幹事七人，分任總務，學術·游藝·體育各股，於每星期一下午四時以後舉行常會一次，討論進行事項，並每月輪流舉行級際聯歡會，藉以聯絡各級同學之感情，並表演餘興以資娛樂。</p>
<p>3厲行早操—早操之目的，一在鍛鍊身體，二在養成早起之習慣，每晨於早餐前舉行之，當學生出塲時，除由體育敎員指導外，並由訓育人員及各級導師隨同監察，以便考查。</p>
<p>4舉行個別及團體談話—欲使師生間感情融洽，學生與學校免除隔閡，非常與學生舉行個別談話不可，學生之思想行爲有不合時，隨時懇切級勸告以糾正之，學生有身受苦痛及懷抱，可藉談話以申述之，個別談話收效甚宏。團體談話校長導師及訓育人員時常行之，全體訓話則於舉行紀念週時行之。</p>
<p>5出版壁報—此種壁報完全由各級學生撰稿，藉以養成學生發表之能力，每級於兩星期內出版一次，內容略分論壇·時事·科學·文藝諸關。尤注重學術上之探討及時事之記錄，　　以來，成績頗有可觀。</p>
<p>6舉行師生同集會—本校每學期舉行師生同樂會一二次，各級學生分記節目，敎師亦逢塲作戲，參加表演，每有所舉，無不盡歡而散，翌日仍照常上課，不露倦意，蓋興會所至，精神倍增也。</p>
<p>7組織節儉國團—際此經濟枯竭，國難深重之時，學生爲智識份子，自應節衣縮食以盡愛國之責，故有節儉救國團之產生，其目的在使全體同學實行不奢華不裝飾不用外國貨，其辦法則公議規約，由國中負責人執行，並擬定獎懲辦法，進行以業，同學多能遵守，此種精神及舉動，實爲上海女學校開一新紀元。</p>
<p>（乙）管理方面</p>
<p>1嚴查私自出校—都市社會爲萬惡淵藪，青年意志薄弱，涉足其間，最易墮落，故管理不得不嚴，本校對於寄宿生，每晚於自修退入寢室後必有一二次點名，如發現未經請假核准而私自出外者，一律除名。</p>
<p>2檢查宿舍敎室整潔—宿舍敎室之整潔，非特有關學校之觀瞻，且於公共衛生至關重要，本校對於整潔事項，除每週定期舉行大掃除外，尚有日常之整潔檢查，每週統計一次，成績最優者給以整潔獎旗，以示鼓勵。</p>
<p>3訂定請假辦法—請假最易荒廢學業，學生非有疾病及不得已事故，均不准請假，請假辦法，分例假與課假兩種，例假係不缺課者，每星期每人一次，星期六下午課畢或星期日請假出校者，於下午六時前必須回校，如家在本埠者，由家長正式備函要求，領取留宿證，方准在外過宿，請課假者，均須家長函達訓育處說明事由，方能有效，如係病假者，須經校醫證明方可照准。</p>
<p>（丙）今後計劃</p>
<p>吾人從事任何工作，欲期相當成效，勘不競競業業，與時推進，夫然後有徵於其果，百事如斯，敎育曷能獨外，月章棉簿，沗長本校，六易寒暑，雖荷政府長官，社會父老，暨校董諸公，時賜箴規，倖免隕越，然丁茲十週之　，要宜省緊遏去，　　　　，　　物質精神兩方，崙具改進計劃，亦以　　　　，偉政有所趨云耳</p>
<p>甲，物質方面</p>
<p>建築校舍　本校校舍，　　　　，年費萬金，固不經濟，而影響於訓育敎務者，更非淺　，月章此念刻未忘懷，往歲校董會决議，募欵建築，業承各方熱心敎育人士，先後函知本校，僉謂經募略有成數，一俟滙　，即購地鳩工，從事興建，行得渠　夏屋，俾敎濟濟修遊，此心或可稍　。</p>
<p>（二）增加設備</p>
<p>1.充塞圖　學生在校，研究學識，純賴敎科書本，所得幾何？搜藏豐富之圖供給，不容或緩，本校圖書舊有冊帙，如經史子集，各科名著及當代雜誌約九千冊，此後擬將常費，撙節開支，每學期購置圖書二千冊，以餉學子。</p>
<p>2.添闢實騐室　科學實騐之重要不待煩言，過去限於校舍不敷應用，實騐室尚付闕如，新校舍落成後，首當添闢理化及動植物實騐室各一所，以資充分研究。</p>
<p>3.體育藝術暨商科之設備　體育，科擬增加童子軍之設備，添購運動器械，藝術科另闢專科敎室，多購模型等特，商科學生，日益增多，原有打字機不足支配，勢須增購，另組銀行消費合作社供其實習。</p>
<p>乙.精神方面</p>
<p>（一）改進行政組織</p>
<p>1.統一事權　學校行政，合而爲一體，分而爲各部，其間關係，至爲密切，精神融洽而不可離，職務分擔而有界限，至其結果，則以行政中心，爲其共趣之鵠的而後可以收指臂之效，本校以往組織，間有攷慮未周，因而影響行政效率者，或未能免，是後修訂事務，文書·敎務·訓育·以及其他各部各股章則，務收事權統一之效。</p>
<p>2.溝通訓敎精神　晚近各校，訓育敎學，各自爲政，主其事者，旣習視訓敎爲兩端，被其敎者，亦分品學爲二事，如此栽培，自難獲得良果，各校當局，檢察過去錯誤，乃有訓敎合一之實施，併敎務訓育兩部，而置敎導主任一人，本校亦會試行此制，過去錯誤，不謂無補，然舉全校訓敎職責，加諸一人之身，瞻此顧彼，精力幾何，月章竊謂訓敎合一，不在名義上之糾正，而在實施上精神與方法之融和，茍吾人刻刻以訓即敎，敎即訓爲念，自可免事務偏勞之苦，更能得訓敎合一之義，區區之見，願質高明。</p>
<p>3.共同生活　職校員生活習慣，無在而不爲學生楷模，所謂端師表也，若飲食起居，漫不注意，學生耳濡目染，無形减少敎育效能不少，記曰，「始駕馬者反之，車在馬前，」其斯之謂歟，於不久的將來，師生實行共同生活，凡服飾飲食游息諸端，無不與學生共趨於簡單樸素之一途。</p>
<p>4.增設學級　本校計分小學初中高中三部，高中部復分普通科·商科·師范科·（現已奉令結束）凡十三學級，本年寒假，中學部初一高一，添招春季新生各一班，小學部，添辦幼租園，藉謀擴充。</p>
<p>（二）實施職業指導</p>
<p>1.設職業指導部　於事務敎務，訓育　部而外，添設職業指導一部，俾得有組織有系統之指導。</p>
<p>2.特設職業講座　聘請職業敎育專家，每週至校講演，使學生獲得職　上之高深學，識，與從事職業之途徑。</p>
<p>3.職業介紹　與實業界切實聯絡學生畢業後學校得盡相機介紹之責。</p>
<p>（三）擴充學校敎育職能</p>
<p>1.聯絡家庭　家庭與學校，有息息相關之勢，學生在家庭生活習慣，與夫家庭環境，學校須切實明瞭，學生在校之生活狀况，家庭亦當了了，如此學校對學生之個別訓練則有準繩，家庭所期望於學校者，亦正易辦，且家長與敎師接洽之機會旣多，情感即日益敦厚，聲氣互通，在敎育上獲得無形之功效不淺。</p>
<p>2溝通社會　「閉戶造車，出門未必合轍」，敎育學者又謂「學校即社會」，「敎育即生活」本上諸義，學校與社會，當力謀溝通，以期打成一片。</p>

<p>— 楨</p>
<p>查歐美各國長途電話通話，均係規定三分鍾制。交通部所主辦之各省長途電話，以採用三分鍾制爲原則，在開創期間，間亦採用五分鍾制。曾於去年十二月依照實際距離規定三分鍾制與五分鍾制價目標準，以資劃一。現在國內長途電話設備，已到相當發展程度，而國際無綫電話，正定期實行，爲謀適合國際通話標準，及將來接通國際電話起見，接國際間之規定，將全國通話價目，按照空間距離爲標準自四月份起，次第採用三分鍾制，此交通部改訂長途電話價目之所由也。</p>
<p>不意此項價目實行後，京滬路綫之用戶，間有抱不滿意者。友人吳君寓書於余，關於此事，提出討論三點：（一）每次通話，兩地傳呼，音欠清晰，一再解說，方言互異，事實上决非三分鍾所能完畢。（二）京滬間昔日通話五分鍾，按一單位，納費一元五角，今則通話四分鍾，須納費二元四角，所增價額，意達百分之六十！（三）依國府明令，凡有專賣獨占或特許性之企業，無論其官辦商辦，或官商合辦者，如因過度費用，而欲增加人民負擔，除法律已有規定外，應先由中政會議定原則，交立法院審議內容，方得决定，否則認爲違法。吾子素稔交通界，其有以敎我乎？吳君所言，頗具一部分理由。加以研究，則成立下列諸問題：（一）通話時間，三分鍾是否足用？（二）三分鍾制價目，是否增加百分之六十？（三）交通部改訂長話價目，是否違法是也。</p>
<p>交通部爲便利民眾通訊起見，曾將電報各種收費辦法，改訂每年損失約五十餘萬元之多，而長途電話加急通話，原係三倍收費者，去年十月减爲二倍收費，每年損失，亦有十餘萬元之譜，事實具在，有目共覩者也。若謂此次改訂長話價目，爲故意增加民眾負擔，恐非事理之平，經作者採真相，爰答客難如左：</p>
<p>（一）通話時間三分鍾足以够用　所謂三分鍾制者，自受話人答話時起，至話畢表示時止，爲三分鍾，在此限度時間內，爲第一次通話，逾此爲第二次通話，連續通話，不得逾二次之謂也，據專家告稱：凡使用長途電話者，均係臨時極簡單而又緊迫之事，彼此對答，三言兩句，卽可解决，三分鍾時間，儘足敷用，不必刺刺不休，必需五分鍾時間也。如在三分鍾內不能解决之事，儘可利用電話報傳遞，不必乞監於長途電話矣。至於音欠清晰一節，係技術問題，與時間無關，主管機關，通話時間，縱規定十分鍾一次，亦無益也。蓋以遠隔重洋尚能恍如對晤，京滬况在咫尺，反不能問答如流耶？</p>
<p>（二）通話價目未增加百分之六十　爲比較顯明起見，茲將交通部頒行之兩種標準價目，探錄如次；</p>
<p>三分鍾制</p>
<p>公里數（空間距離）價目（銀元）</p>
<p>〇—二〇　〇·一〇</p>
<p>二〇—四〇　〇·二〇</p>
<p>四〇—六〇　〇·三〇</p>
<p>六〇—八〇　〇·四〇</p>
<p>八〇—一〇〇　〇·五〇</p>
<p>一〇〇—一二五　〇·六〇</p>
<p>一二五—一五〇　〇·七〇</p>
<p>一五〇—一七五　〇·八〇</p>
<p>一七五—二〇〇　〇·九〇</p>
<p>二〇〇—二二五　一·〇〇</p>
<p>二二五—二五〇　一·一〇</p>
<p>二五〇—二七五　一·二〇</p>
<p>二七五—三〇〇　一·三〇</p>
<p>五分鍾制</p>
<p>公里數（空間距離）價目（銀元）</p>
<p>〇—一五　〇·一〇</p>
<p>一五—三〇　〇·二〇</p>
<p>三〇—四五　〇·三〇</p>
<p>四五—六〇　〇·四〇</p>
<p>六〇—七五　〇·五〇</p>
<p>七五—九〇　〇·六〇</p>
<p>九〇—一一〇　〇·七〇</p>
<p>一一〇—一三〇　〇·八〇</p>
<p>一三〇—一五〇　〇·九〇</p>
<p>一五〇—一七〇　一·〇〇</p>
<p>一七〇—一九〇　一·一〇</p>
<p>一九〇—二一〇　一·二〇</p>
<p>二一〇—二三〇　一·三〇</p>
<p>準上表觀之，以起碼距離而言，三分鍾制爲二十公里，較五分鍾制十五公里者多五公里。以同一話費而言：則以一元三角之費，三分鍾制，可通話三百公里，五分鍾制，僅能通二百三十公里，京滬空間距離，約二百七十公里，故規定價目爲一元二角，較原五分鍾制，减少三角。若以二次通話六分鍾而言；則三分鍾制，瞧收話費二元四角，五分鍾制應收話費三元，同爲六分鍾時間，而三分鍾制，實减低百分之二十矣。且也空間距離與綫路距離有別，綫路因工程上之關係，灣折甚多，空間則以兩方距離，形本直綫，互相比較，差額約百分與八十之比，從前計算距離，以綫路爲准，今則以空間標準，此中損失，又爲百分之二十矣！</p>
<p>再以京滬綫之價目而言：原來該綫價目，係北京政府初聞放滬錫時，以每次三分鍾計算，嗣後通話時間，暫改爲五分鍾，作一次通話，價目並未增加。其後綫路展長至各地，通話價目，仍照前定比例計算，致京滬話價，較全國各綫爲低。茲經交通部將原來三分鍾制之價目，—一元五角，减訂爲現行價目—一元二角—收費，此於便利民眾通信之道，似無可苛求者也。</p>
<p>查平津長途通話，規定爲三分鍾制，實行有年。平津距離爲一百十二公里，而價目定爲六角，社會稱便。又查全國各地長途電話之五分鍾制者，自今年四月一日起，次第改爲三分鐘制，亦未聞非議者，今京滬距離爲二百七十公里，實行三分鍾制，减訂價目爲一元二角，用戶尚感若何困難耶？</p>
<p>（三）交通部改訂電話價目是否違法　此事余非法律專家，雖以置答。惟聞交通部歷年改訂電報電話價目，改訂郵寄航運價目，鐵道部改訂各路運輸價目，似均未經立法院審議，社會人士，亦未聞以違法目之者。交通部主辦之交通事業，是否與普通官辦企業相提並論？交通部改訂報話價目，是否已有法律根據？吾子如質之交通當局，想有明白答復也。</p>
<p>總之，交通部此次規定長途電話價目，外之採用國際現行制度，以便與國際人士通話，內之準酌國民經濟情形，以期與社會人士合作，决非以牟利爲目的，不顧民眾利益者可比，同時用戶如有意見，交通部無不推誠相與，在可能範圍之內，儘量接收。吾子領袖羣倫，萬流敬仰，尚乞多方開導，以袪一般人士之惑也，幸甚，</p>
<p>吳君聞之曰：善！作「爲三分鍾制答客難」。</p>
<h3 id="c240">裝用電話的利益 <a href="#c240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— 中明</p>
<p>在上期本刊中，讀清華君所寫「電報與長途電話之比較」一文，把報話利益的比較，分晰極爲詳盡，使公眾讀過此文之後，對於長途電話與電報的分別，得到一個很明晰的概念：能判別當在什麼時候宜打電話或是宜拍電報。不過清華君所陳述的衹是報話利益的比較，並非是單純地在講演電報或是電話的效用。關於電報的效用本刊已迭有記載，可說已發揮盡致，至於電話呢？尚少明白的寫述。</p>
<p>請到電話的效用，可說是千頭萬緒，一言難盡。要形容電話的效用，我想最好是把以前九福公司形容牠所出的藥品叫做「百齡機」的一句最爲合式，就是「有意想不到的效力！」這八個字，真的，電話的各種效用，說起來真是膚淺，但常人往往因爲膚淺而忽略了，遂致間接地或直接地損失許多利益和機會，或是平白地多費許多精力，時間和金錢呢！</p>
<p>話雖如此，我不妨舉一個簡單的例子：就是去年夏季，天氣酷熱，室內熱度常在九十七八度左右，有時竟超過百度以上，於是首都市上，冰店如林，照例講在這樣大熱天，做這樣應時的買賣，應該是生意興隆的了。豈知事實並不如此，因爲冰店太多了，供過於求，也無甚贏利可言，但其中有幾家着實做了些買賣，他們不專靠做門市生意，而主要的交易，全在整桶冰淇淋的出送，原來這幾家見識遠大，與眾不同，都在店內裝着電話。許多衙門·公館·商店裏的人，當工作繁忙揮汗如雨的時候，都想飲冰解暑，如果叫僕人或自己親自去買，時間旣不經濟，而且誰又願意在如火的烈日底下奔跑呢？所以他們都揀了裝有電話的這幾家叫送，冰店接到電話，馬上着人騎乘自行車帶了冰淇淋飛馳而往，片刻而至，這樣多麼的使得顧客稱心滿意啊！無怪乎生意興隆了！</p>
<p>上回這個例子，已把電話的效用表明了一丈半；冰店因爲裝有電話而獲得許多生意，這是利益；因爲裝有電話而人家會找到他或是他去招徠人愛，這是機會；至於裝有電話的用戶可以悠然地躺在沙發上輕撥了話機，叫冰淇淋來喝，這就是節省金錢時間和精力，而且又何等舒適。這個例子的原則，可以推論至凡百事業，無論何人，都可適用。換一句話說，就是電話有能幫助百樂發展的效用。</p>
<p>可是電話的效用，並不止此。牠還有靈通消息，熟悉市情，輔助公安，增進友誼，破除寂寞，解救急難等等的效用。不論經商或是從政的人，必須消息靈通，如果備有電話，則消息自易於傳達，或報告他人或向他人探聽。至於經商的人，尤其要熟識市情，以便賣買，如果不按電話，憑着一雙腿奔走跋涉，非但吃力費時，而且所得的市情，也是有限的。講到輔助治安，則電話尤能發揮偉大的效用，譬如某地發生火警或盜刦，可以藉電話之力，立刻通知消息防機關，到塲救減，或公安機關派警緝捕盜匪。再如一二知已相慮城南城北，久別思晤，但親自訪謁，則又路遠費時，尤怕會面不到，此時便可在話機上和他暢敘衷曲，或約期面談均可，這於雙方友誼的增進，話機是應居首功的。又或吾人在百無聊賴的時候，也可以利用電話找友談心，藉此破除岑寂，給以安慰。至於遇到突患急症或孕婦半夜分娩等急事時，電話最是人們的恩物。電話的效用是說不盡的，想不盡的，把「意相不到」四個字來形容牠是再確當不過了！</p>
<p>再有一件事在這里順便和諸位談談，就是交通部所屬上海·天津·北平·武漢·青島·首都·吳縣·鎮江·烟台·等電話局均設有問訊台，除答復公眾詢問電話號碼外，兼任答復用戶詢問當地各種種事務，並不收費。此範圍包括：（一）標準時刻；（二）當日發生火警地點；（三）郵局電局每日營業時間；（四）國內外電報通報地點及價目；（五）國內外郵件通地點及寄費郵資；（六）各娛樂塲所當日節目及時間；（七）火車輪船及長途汽車開行時刻及價目；（八）市內電話租費及長途電話通話地點及價目。此項辦法自本年四月一日實行以業，公眾極爲讚許。所以在各大埠的電話用戶，除享受種種利益之外，無異又添雇着一位忠實的人事顧問。</p>

<p>籌設臨時電局收發電報兼售電話</p>
<p>全國運動大會，事關我國體育前途甚鉅，頗能引起全國界之注意。疊次在杭州，南京等處舉行，莫不盛極一時，交通部爲提倡運動及便利消息起出，歷經令飭杭州，南京等處郵政管理局及電報避在大會開會時設置臨時會塲郵電局所，辦理頗具成績，極能博得社會上之好評。此次第六屆全國運動大會將於國慶日在上海開幕。屆時市中心區道上，當有一番車水馬龍之盛况。聞交通部業已飭由上海電報局援照成例，在市中心區大會會塲內籌設臨時電局，與大會同時開幕。</p>
<p>臨時電局之任務，大部份爲傳遞大會報告運動成績電報。爲謀傳遞迅速起見，將在臨時電避內裝置韋氏電報機或克利特電報機。一面設法騰出電報綫路，預備開放各地直百足之蟲，俾臨時電發局者之一部份電報，可以不必經由上海電報局掃轉，以咨迅捷。一面特准大會記帳拍發報告運動成績之硬性新聞電，以便大會將運動成績之硬性新聞電，以便大會將運動消息隨時電達各地報館，使外埠不能蒞會參觀之民眾亦可於次日報上得悉大會之運動成績。同時臨時電局內附設公用電話兼售市內及長途電話，以利通話，可見臨時電局之設置，完全爲贊助大會傳遞運動消息，絕非牟利性質也。</p>
<p>上屆全運會在京開會時，交通部爲優待各省市選手發電起見，特訂有全國運動大會選手發電優待辦法一種，連同國內交際電報規則合印傳單數千份散發大會各選手。本屆大會，事同一律，交通部已將上項優待選手發電辦法飭由上海電報局照辦。查該項辦法之規定，各省市選手本人所發報告行止起居及運動消息之華英文明語電報，得按國內交際電報價目付費，（卽華文每字二分，洋文每字四分），但仍列作尋常電傳遞，且隨到隨送，（按交際電在當日下午九時以後，次日上午八時以前到達收報電局者，照章應俟至次日八時以後投送。但選手所發减價電報仍照尋常電例隨到隨送），可謂特別優待。大會男女選手均自各省市遠道而來，對於家鄉父母兄弟姊妹雖云小別，能無懷念。現在旣有廉價發電之機會，儘可隨時去電告慰，迢迢千里，不啻晤談一室，各選手當可釋益於懷，努力運動，奪得錦標而歸。</p>
<p>再國內交際電報之電文範圍，業經擴大。關於慶祝「勝利」之電報，亦得更作交際電拍發。各選手之家屬或親友，如得已獲勝某項運動之電告，或閱報得悉勝利消息，均可拍發交際電報，以表慶賀，而資策勵。各選手接到賀電後，精神自必格外興奮，因此競賽成績，打破全國最高紀錄也。</p>
<p>交通部爲勵行郵電合設政策起見，已飭上海電報局商請上海郵政管理局將臨時郵局與電局合設一處，以樹郵電合設之楷模，百便公眾通訊。現距大會開幕之期，已無多日，行見上項臨時郵電合設局所，不久與公眾相見矣。</p>
<h3 id="c243">上海電報局圈購錢糧廟基地評議 <a href="#c243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— 驊</p>
<p>上海電報局近以擴充發報電台，在滬杭公路錢糧廟車站　北長橋鎮之南，圈購基地三百畝，由內政部公告收買，頗引起當地一部份人民之誤會，迭次籲請院部收回　命，各報亦屢有紀載。記出以上海電局此次因購基地，關係發展電信交通甚鉅，爲袪除社會人士之疑慮起見，爰將經過實情探錄如次：</p>
<p>上海爲世界商埠，亦爲我國對外貿易之樞紐。故電報通信，極爲繁忙，自短波無綫電發明以來，益以報務上及技術上之關係，形成國內無綫電通信網之中心。民國二十年間，前上海無綫電總台即以業務繁忙，原有人工收發機不克應付，早擬改善設備，以利通訊，但當時以發報電台侷促於陸家浜上等中學校內，無法擴充。且以該校校舍屢有遷讓之議，無綫電通信時有中斷之虞，故爲一勞永逸計，曾呈准交部圈購錢糧廟地二百畝，以備建築發報台之用，當時內政部亦曾出示公告，未聞當地人民有何反對，迨一二八事變發生，圈購之事暫形擱置，發報台亦暫遷中華路麥根路及新閘路三處勉爲應付，顧各該處皆地位狹隘，天綫無從展佈。更以四週危樓高聳，電波輙受阻碍。通信效率，自不免影響。自去年局台合併以後，電報業務旣更形繁重，擴充無綫電設備，益刻不容緩，爰仍循舊議，在錢糧廟購地興建。</p>
<p>此次上　局圈購錢糧廟地三百畝，較之民國二十年時，增多一百畝。其原因固爲計劃之變更，抑亦技術上之需要。蓋各天綫間爲避免相互間之感想，各付間須有充分之距離，大約定向天綫菩提樹每付須地六畝，非定向者三畝。又以日夜工作用兩種波長，須各備天綫兩付故預定天綫有五十八付，共需地約二百三十餘畝，外加建築房屋走道及預留擴充地位等等，又非有五六十畝不可，故上海局新發報台基地面積，至少須有三百畝之廣，實非過甚之要求。</p>
<p>按無綫電通信，全賴電波發射，而電波發射之良否，全視發報電台四周有無高大建築或樹木森林阻碍射程。錢糧廟車站以北一地，空曠無際，極合上述之條件，故關爲無綫電發報台基地，至爲相宜。且距離南市華商電氣公司沿滬杭公路敷設之高壓輸送綫，僅四公里許，將來擴展接通，對於饋電一式子，亦頗便利，故特選定此地以備應用。事實上該地確備有種種客觀條件初非特別對於某地有故意之苛求也。</p>
<p>綜上所述，上海局圈購錢糧廟基地，實爲發展電信交通必要之舉，絕非對於該地有謀利之意。吾入深望當地人民了解國營事業之重要，勿再作固執之非議。尤望與論界一致扶助，俾袪除社會士人無謂之誤會，實所盼禱也。</p>

<p>（四）關於投送電報辦法者：投送電報爲電局重要任務之一，故電局對於投送來電，必須有詳盡周密之規定，方可增進遞電速率。交通部有鑒於斯，特於新訂之國內電報營業通則內詳細規定投送電報辦法及專力費價目，以便各電局有所遵循。其較舊章改善和喀吧，略舉如下：一，報差送報，如遇收報人寓所門戶關閉或無人允爲代收時，應於該處設法留一通知並將電報　回，俟收報人或其代表携帶圖章到局領取。此項待領之電報，如逾十二小時未來領取者，應再送一次。如仍屬不能送妥者，應卽按照無法投遞電報辦法辦理，登報招領。（二）送交到埠船內旅客之電報，在可能範圍內，應於收報人未登陸以前送去。如爲時間所不許者，得將電報送交該船舶之經理人。（三）尋常·加急·或交際三類華文明語來報，均應由電局代爲譯成文字後投送，不收譯費。以上三則，對於收報人自有相當便利，未始非電局服務精神之改進也。</p>
<p>至專力費價目，爲適應實際需要起見，雖較舊章略爲提高。但專力費價目增高以後，交通部已嚴令各電避嗣後發應切遵規定價目收費，不得再有故違功令任意浮收需索情事。收報人如遇有報差　外需索，儘可詳敘事事實連同證件逕向交通部電政司聲訴，以便照章嚴懲。</p>

<p>— 韋立</p>
<p>—請發報人注意—</p>
<p>上海電報局，國際電臺及國際電信局所轄三水綫電報收發處，因鑒於洋文電報之計算字數，尚無確切標準，特擬訂一個「英文明語電報計算字數暫行辦法。」現爲便利發報人起見，節要譯爲華文，介紹於此：</p>
<p>英文明語電報計算字數暫行辦法</p>

<p>— 記者</p>
<p>茲承惠函垂詢關於收發電報各節，謹答復如下：</p>
<p>（一）發往日本之電報，如其電文係用華文四碼者，其收報人姓名住址可用日文譯出，以利投遞。</p>
<p>（二）發往日本之日文電報，（以假名拚成者）除國際電台可以收發外，青島，四方，滄口三處電局亦均照收。</p>
<p>（三）日文電報內衹能夾雜阿拉伯數目字，每一個數目字作一個日文字母計費。</p>
<p>（四）西文電報內衹准用重音字母，　，其餘槪不准用。又chji應作兩個字母計算。</p>
<p>（五）暗語與綴字語准用之文字並無限制。凡用二十六個字母組成者均可稱爲暗語或綴字語。暗語或綴字語電報內亦可夾用阿拉伯數目字，但其字數不能超過全電字數之一半。</p>
<p>（六）暗語係用杜撰字組成，（所含字母五個）或用真字而不含其所文字之原來意義者，或以真字與杜撰字混合構成者，例如：Klvgk　Cramn卽係完全用杜撰字組織而成，又如Klvgk　Batci　Continental　hotel卽係杜撰字及明語字混合構成者，均作爲暗語電報。</p>
<p>凡字語名稱或結合成組之字母，不合明語及暗語之規定者，例如Cramgliork一字係屬杜撰字而又不合暗語之規定（因所含字母超過五個），故應作爲綴字語也。</p>

<p>一個清麗的秋天晚上，清澈如水銀的月光，把靠近陽台的四扇落地窗，塗上一層美麗的銀灰色，帶有寒意的九月的凉風，湊趣的輕輕的吹拂着紫羅蘭色的長窗帘。白熱的電燈光，經過淡綠色的燈罩，顯出得光明，和乳色的牆壁相襯，色調是十分的融和。强生安適的坐在沙發上有當天報紙，瑪麗呢，靜靜的坐在椅上，認真的結絨綫衫，室中籠罩在靜穆，快活，和洽的氛圍中。</p>
<p>忽然，强生發見什麼奇績似的叫了起來，「瑪麗！你快來看呀！這裏有好消息呢！我們的難題可以解决了。」</p>
<p>正在認真結絨綫衫的瑪麗，給他突然的叫喚，嚇了一跳，就放下絨綫衫，珊珊的走到强生身旁，嬌嗔道：「發見什麼奇績呀！值得這樣大呼小叫呢？」</p>
<p>强生陪笑道：「吾愛，別生氣，來，請到這裏來坐，我有好東西給你看呢！」一面說一面把瑪麗拖過來：並排坐在沙發中。</p>
<p>「瑪麗！你瞧，這不是好消息嗎？安娜和柏遜不是要出席第六屆全國運動會嗎？我正想不出最敏捷最新鮮的方法，去鼓勵他們努力「加油」，和慶祝他們的最後勝利。現在好了，交際電報可以解决這個難題了」。</p>
<p>「是呀！這够多麼好呢」！瑪麗看着報紙笑着說：「真是比任何禮物都好。因爲這是多麼有意義啊」！</p>
<p>「那麼，我們明天去拍發吧」！强生想了想說：「並且那天是十月十日，我們一方面慶祝他們的勝利，同時可以慶祝我們的國慶紀念日，正是一舉兩得啊」！</p>
<p>强生的話是不錯的，交際電報是一件頂好的禮物。</p>

<h3 id="c248">籌創專捉臭蟲公司 <a href="#c248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— 吹</p>
<p>昨據新聲社消息，頃有從事昆蟲學研究之專家數人，現商洽組織一捉臭蟲公司，據云，臭蟲在昆蟲種類、爲一尋常而又特奇之害蟲、以專吮人血而生存，蕃殖之速，人莫能治，含有世界性，目前世界大都會中，咸有此害蟲之踪跡，英美人呼之爲害蟲，亦呼之爲南京蟲，實此蟲非中國產也，中國交通不便之窮鄉僻壤，此蟲全無，卽係明證。南京博得此臭蟲之惡名，眞是南京之不幸，而臭蟲之大幸也。</p>
<p>南京蟲之得名，據云係轉據日本名詞，日本以臭蟲在中國南京爲獨多故名，其實誤也。臭蟲之稱爲南京，原係根據南京條約而來，自該條約訂立以來，近百年中，我國之民脂民膏，多爲外人吸收殆盡，以致我國皮焦骨立，形容枯槁，民窮財盡，羅掘俱窮，多是受南京條約的影響，故政治上的臭蟲，此較昆蟲類的臭蟲，更爲厲害，故臭蟲之名爲南京，顧名思義，頗爲應當。</p>
<p>據昆蟲學者的研究，謂臭蟲在昆蟲種類，爲一尋常而又特殊之害蟲，以專吮人血而生存，蕃殖之速，人莫能治，確眞，臭虫所到之處，卽人無安寗之日，家有臭虫，則寢處不安，精神怠疲，捉不勝捉，搜不勝搜，防於彼則生於此，除其左則擾其右，故臭虫之侵略，無殊於政治上侵略，故臭虫之名爲南京，殊有深意，事實雖異，而性質則同。</p>
<p>但臭虫之擾亂治安，有一定之時期，在春夏之時，則小醜跳梁，橫行無忌，若至秋冬，則稍稍斂跡，伏居深處，不敢再出搗亂。而政治上之亂虫，既無定時，亦無定向，乘人之危，扼人之急，則更無法制裁，故昆虫類之臭虫易除，，而政治上臭虫難除，並且臭虫之類甚多，奚止南京虫而已，他若土豪劣紳之魚肉鄉民，亦是臭虫之類，貪官污吏之剝削平民，亦是臭虫之類，其他若奸商市儈之類，亦無一而非臭虫，臭虫旣如是之多，卽使專設公司，恐亦捉不勝捉矣。</p>
<h3 id="c249">慶雲古寺 <a href="#c249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— 樺枷</p>
<p>便是在這樣的一個秋初的天氣，在遙遠的南方還是暑熱的溫度的淸晨，凡吹着我們兩個靑年在趕着路。從下院到上院的路，是有着差不多一小時的崎嶇的山路的距離。然而，假如我們不在這太陽還未逞威的淸晨趕上山去，相信是會象童話里而所說述的南方太陽國的鳥因爲貪圖吃人的肉而忘記了太陽會出來把牠曝斃的一樣。實在也是的，倘如要在太陽最猛烈的時候，去趕這一小時的山路，那是一定會使人更容易地感冒起來的，這不是和上山的志願恰巧地相　反了嗎。本來，在上山的途徑里，是有着一種被喚作「山兜」（山轎）的來常作代步的，而且只要你在下院那里向知客僧關照一聲，他便會很迅速的地跟你喊了來，因爲肩山兜的人便是他仙寺里的「香伙」（一種在寺里作苦力力事的工人）。但是，爲了我們都是年靑人，而且都是曾經以健步自誇的年靑人，所以我們决意捨棄了一切代步物而趕上這一叚也不算短的路程了。</p>
<p>在我幾年前會到過這地方的時候，上山的路徑，還是那些樵夫們斬柴的鳥徑，現在可不同了，都市的風把原野摧毀了，換過來的是平坦的公路。平坦雖　挽救了崎嶇難行的山路，可是却抵敵不過太陽的熱力，反之只會走在了這些平坦的公路上時，愈顯得熱得難受。當平坦的　路落在我們的後面的時候，我們巳跑到了山腰了。山腰里我們仍得走那些被喚作「羊腸小徑」的曲折的路，可是凉快得多了，山上樹滿了那些高得可以的杉樹棕樹，遮蔭得路上風凉極了，雅然是走着上由的道路，山忘記了疲勞地愉快的走着。</p>
<p>路旁是一條小溪，小溪是從瀑布里激流下來的山水，因此它的淸凉的快意的氣氛，和淙淙的流水聲，把整個山谷浸在快樂的調子里。鳥兒在淸晨的歌唱是特別地動聽的淸嬌，再和上了那是採樵的婦女唱着那些不知名的山歌，老老實實地會把你迷戀着在這山谷里哩。然而，我們爲了肚子覺到了飢餓，詩意的情緒也留戀不住了我們，我們還是在進發着。</p>
<p>「慶雲古寺」</p>
<p>一陣喃喃的唸佛聲吹進了我們的耳朵，我們也在一大幅的風火牆上發現這樣的一個扁額了。這樣我們的目的地便到了。而且在我的經騐在這里而且可以得到一頓也不算得太難過的齋菜來塞着我們飢餓的肚子的。因此，我們很迅速地便去客堂那里找着了知客僧。啊，神氣啊，當我們會見的時候，結果是出乎我意料之外的失望。大概是因爲他那勢利的眼睛從我們的衣服的修飾上看出了幷不象他意想中的「施主」吧，因此跟着來的招待便是一個冷漠。在幾分鐘後，他派了一個小沙彌帶着我們去遊他們的古寺的勝蹟。於是，跟着了「阿彌陀佛」的喊聲下我們走過了如仙人鍋，睡佛樓，搖錢樹，觀音殿，大雄寶殿，十八羅漢，諸如此類諸如此類的，而後又回至客堂來了。這時我們的肚子已經逼着我們不管一切地去要和那知客僧交涉了。到底我們用一種作爲「官」的符號和證章，才把他那勢利眼移轉了來，而得到一頓不十分冷漠的齋菜來果腹。爲了報復，我們也吝惜了我們的慷慨，吃完了一聲不作便走了。</p>
<p>在我們歸途中，我們談論着古寺雖然是躲在深山里。可是也還是一樣地浸花黃金的夢里咧。</p>
<h3 id="c250">棄兒 <a href="#c250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— 眞</p>
<p>在一支憔悴得發霉和老婆子的臉色一樣的電燈下，不知父母是誰的不滿兩歲的小孩兒漸漸由抽搐而入彌留狀態，而脫離這慘酷的人間了。</p>
<p>老婆子的眼簷下掛着兩列亮晶晶的涙痕，經過一個寒暑的親手撫摸，她像親生子那麼繫　着，悲傷着，一刻鐘前小孩兒還叫過一聲媽媽那聲音，此刻尚淸脆地殘留在她的耳際，明天，明天，連這具遺骸也永恆地從她手中失去了！她俯着頭，像是在懺悔：</p>
<p>「兒喲，我這樣喊，也許是侮辱了你！但這不能怪我，你是知道的，你父母巳多時沒信來了，錢也分文不給，四個月了啦！我又找不着地方。」</p>
<p>她倚在床沿上，呆瞧着那小孩兒傷心地哭了。</p>
<p>雖然她對他在良心上可告無罪，可是她的心却經不起這偶然的重壓，恍惚間這慘劇的扮演者仍是她自己。這小魂靈在陰間不會原諒她，病了，她不曾讓他瞧醫生，餓了，她的奶不足，沒有給他吃飽，現在死了，這是最後一次的打撹她，她仍不能給他一具小棺材來贖自已的罪孽。……一種莫名的恐怖在包圍着她，床上，屋子的角落裏：她像扔在凛冽的風雪地帶中，身子只是戰慄着，凸着靑筋的兩手在乾癟的小孩兒的臉頰上摸着。</p>
<p>「你不能跟他去，這不能怪我們，他的父母都不管，我們盡義務養了他四個月，也算是對得住他。」</p>
<p>老頭子瞧兌他老婆子的痴情，大不爲然：雖然他兩老兒還沒兒子，平時對小孩兒也極珍愛。</p>
<p>「他的父母也許死了，不然，不會這樣狠心！」</p>
<p>「死？——聽說他們倆離婚了，兒子，都不肯養」</p>
<p>「天喲！造孽，這種心是要不得的，將來有報應的，眞狠心！」養母覺得她自己所焦慮的罪孽，應歸他的父母擔任，於是她稍微輕鬆起來。</p>
<p>「良心！好的時候，只管兩人的快樂，一鬧翻，連小孩子也不管，這便是現代靑年男女玩的把戲！」</p>
<p>老頭子忿怒中帶着幾分慨嘆，深嵌在眼眶中的瞳人凝滯地。</p>
<p>「那末，他們現在到那裏去了呢？小孩子死了應當找他們來，免得將來說出別的閒話。」</p>
<p>「男的和新太太到外國去了，女的和姘頭一同住在漢口，你去找他們嗎？便是找着了，也未見得還承認。」</p>
<p>兩人靜默了，夜在愴悽的寂寞中深下去，小孩的屍體漸漸變得優直，老婆子的心地頓時起了一種正義戚：</p>
<p>「假如小孩兒能夠長大，也應當不承認這樣的父母！他們沒有費一點心，只養了一下！……那末怎麼辦，這小孩子的屍體？……」</p>
<p>「明天喊小三子來證明一下。」</p>
<p>小三子是最初抱這小孩子來的人，在前幾個月，小三子按月從他父親那裏拿來幾塊錢，可是邊幾月來小三子也找不着他的父親了，自小孩子病後，小三子才說出他父親已到了外國，母親跟了別人。這消息老頭子起初怕給老太婆知道，瞧不起孩子，所以遲到今天才說出來。</p>

<p>老婆子又檢出幾伴較淸潔的衣服替小孩兒穿上，一壁抽咽着繼續到都市的天明。</p>
<p>淸晨，老頭子把小三子找來了。小三子嘆息兩聲，便到善堂裏領了一個小匣子，把小孩子屍體裝進去，當老頭子和小三子把這小匣子扛出門時，那與他有一年歷史的養母啜泣地說：</p>

<p>— 市浦健著　張廣正譯</p>
<p>然，所謂空氣調節法，冬季將滲和適當濕度的加熱空氣，輸送入室內：夏季將消去適當濕度的冷却空氣，輸送入室內。那當然是非常高價的，但同時也是最理想的。此種方法，近來在大商業建築方面，盛被採用，不過住宅方面採用者尚少。從生活的重要性考究，甚願住宅，學校或事務所皆能採用。</p>
<p>夜間照明所必要的，最初被使用的手段是油燈。然，此至最折，給與全人類夜生活的現在，已是電燈時代了。雜以前曾有一時是用煤氣燈，但那已成過去。可預見其將來必不能奪電燈的位置。在電燈照明的形式上，亦有種種發展。然，現在一般人認爲理想的而仍未達普及的間接照明，由於經濟的理由及他方面因沒有光源而感到寂寞的理由，不大爲人們所愛悅。大概將來能夠普及的，却是年紅燈（Neon）的照明。</p>
<p>除照明以外，電氣使用於住宅的用途是動力及燃燒原料。各種簡單的器具所需的動力，幾乎全部均用電力，且至今已有更多東西電氣化了。卽如冷藏庫，裁縫機，風扇，掃除器，收音機，時計，洗濯，門窗的開閉及運搬等，均採用電力。他方面，電氣史被應用於烹調，熨斗，煖房及熱水供給等。</p>
<p>熱水供給，已從原來的靠了汽鍋（Boiler）大規模地處理的方法，更進而至於人們能享受煤氣開水器，電氣開水器普及供給的便利。</p>
<p>衛生設備，有污水處理，排水，污物塵埃處理等幾種。就其主要的以觀，當推污水處理爲最重要。於此，若公設污水溝建造完備，則非常簡單。然，在污水溝仍未普及的現在，各住戶捨設置净化槽外，別無他法。此種淨化槽，最近已改成簡單低廉。故建築起來，亦無需很大的建築費。時至今日，徘水設備於簡單化中，對衛生裝置費的比率已漸减低，且亦漸被發展與改良。</p>
<p>住宅的燃料，代替以前的木炭，煤，現在是媒氣最爲普及。然，照前面所述，則將來實有爲電氣取而代之的命運。誠然，當污黑廚房的木炭仍未完全消滅時，烹煮的大部份已使用媒氣了，日在熨斗，煖房及冷房，熱水供給方面雖亦廣被使用，但時至今日，除價格較低廉外，比諸電氣，實有不少缺點。</p>
<p>於住宅，爲了施行此等設備，則必須使設計與設備成有機的結合，造成相互合理的。因爲這裏實有賴於全體工程的管理，故必須簡單而且統一。例如廚房，煖房，洗濯室的聯絡，浴室，洗面室，便所的　絡，特　能節省面積及减低設備費。故從生活的實用　以觀，設計問題，是特別重要。</p>
<p>如爲了構造的進步，在樓上設置浴室：因與寢室鄰接，故可無需更衣室。又如便器置於浴室內，冲洗既便，再不用費何種衛生上的工夫，且外觀亦並不惡。這麼一來，節省如大的面積，而使用復極簡易。洗濯室不防位於地下室，備一電熨斗，則又是家庭工塲之一了。</p>
<p>從電氣方面着想，若各室均處於適當的位置，則可以合理地節省電燈：電氣方法的防盜設備（自動的特別電鈴），亦可用低廉價格造就。電氣煖房的自動調節，最近亦次第實用化而有應用的希望。</p>
<p>以上所述的各種設備，不管其機械的構造備極複雜，但其使用法却很簡單。然反過來說，其使用法亦可說必須加以相當注意。卽是說，若一般的科學常識不進步，則此等進步的設備不能普及。蓋這些設備的使用法，顯示了必要相當的科學智識。由於電氣設備的著著進步，電力的價格必更趨低落，勢將使生活更進於愉適。</p>
<p>住宅既不單祗委於建築，他方面，設備亦有連帶的關係：既不單看做祇是爲了住的機械，而實是負全部生活容器的資任。能這樣了解，則乃極可喜的事。此種全部生活的容器，有堅於完備的構造及合理的佈置與設計。而此三條伴，實有待建築家從事於有機的統制，才有實現的可能。（完）</p>
<h3 id="c261">瑞典的平民住宅建築（上） <a href="#c261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— 不忍</p>
<p>目前，在瑞典全境，平民公寓所供給的住宅，達二二，〇〇〇所，住戶大抵是工人，商人，夥友，下級官吏，及他們的家屬。只在斯篤科爾摩一處，住在此種公寓中的人民達六十萬人，計占全市人口百分之十。其他市區，摹仿斯篤科爾摩之房屋合作制度者，不下十餘處，其中最大者爲哥敦堡，麥爾瑪，及諾科平。</p>
<p>瑞典全國，用於建造房屋的經費，達八〇、〇〇〇、〇〇〇元。房屋建造的發達，使失業者得到工作，工業得到鼓勵。同時，大部分人民的生活標準比前提高，無數年老者與兒童的健康得到保護。</p>
<p>瑞典的平民公寓，有「象屋（Elephanthouse）之稱，外觀之高大莊嚴，內部設備之週到整潔，决非他國之平民住宅所及。走進大門，參觀者就看到一座公共游戲塲，擠滿着兒童；在徑路兩旁，有草地，有籬笆，有花圃，整齊而且優雅，有公用的園丁專門照顧。</p>
<p>容納二家至四家的小公寓，達二百零五所。輕輕叩門，就有人接應，因爲住戶都樂於把他的新住宅指點給來賓看。浴室中有冷熱水龍頭，有化妝品櫥；廚房中有整潔的碗具，有電氣冰箱，有煤氣灶，有白瓷水槽。</p>
<p>室中，有牀有榻。屋中央放着檯子，檯上有書有花瓶。從門望到洋台，可以看到從天花板掛下來的花籃；靑色的篷帳蔗蔽着陽光。寢室是小的，但瑞典人慣於住在狹隘的屋子；假如屋子寬大，他就把他分隔爲二。</p>
<p>公寓的最上層爲公共育兒所：有職業的婦女出外工作時可把孩子留在這里，委託精練的保姆代爲照顧，所費亦頗有限。公共育兒所中，有餐室，有圖書室。講故事一小時是每日功課之一。又有療養室，孩子略有病象，就給療洽。育兒所週圍是屋頂花園，最適宜於施行日光浴與休息。</p>
<p>公寓中的設備，不嫌簡單，但以不妨礙便利與舒適爲原則。最新造的公寓都用鋼骨水泥：都裝有自動電梯。可以代替人工的電氣設備，應有盡有。各層都裝有廢料自動搬運器。窗門是用獨塊「鏡子玻璃」（Mirrorglass）做的，使不礙視綫；窗門需要洗刷時，可向屋內旋轉，值洗刷者不必站在窗沿上。各層地板，都舖漆布。每一住宅，都裝無綫電收音機一座，由公寓中的總機間接播音。</p>
<p>更有一種設備，裝在一所小房屋中，能自動打掃地毯墊子等物。各居戶在搬入以前，須將傢具消毒。</p>
<h3 id="c262">室內配光之研究（卞） <a href="#c262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— 欽</p>
<p>光綫之來源可分主副兩種，前者如日光與燈光是，後者乃反射之光綫與彩色所射之光綫是。故室內油漆之施用關係一室之美觀甚大，若施用得當則可以調劑日光與燈光之不足，且其光綫往往呈散光性，無眩耀人目之弊，大有益於室內之裝飾。油漆對於光綫之反射力量有強弱之不同，色淺者反射力強，色暗者反射力弱。欲求完美之彩色計劃，必須使強弱不同之油漆互相調節，得相宜之配合。下表示各種顏色對於光綫之反射力比例，以養鎂化之反射力（百分之九十八）爲標準。</p>
<p>白色……八四·〇％</p>
<p>乳白色……七〇·四％</p>
<p>緋色……六九·四％</p>
<p>象牙色……六四·三％</p>
<p>黃色……六〇·五％</p>
<p>肉色……五六·〇％</p>
<p>牛皮色……五五·四％</p>
<p>淺綠色……五四·一％</p>
<p>淺灰色……五三·六％</p>
<p>淺藍色……四五·五％</p>
<p>鋁灰色……四一·九％</p>
<p>棕色……二三·六％</p>
<p>深紅色……一四·四％</p>
<p>深綠色……九·八％</p>
<p>深藍色……九·三％</p>
<p>黑色……一〇·〇％</p>
<p>室內光綫自以反射光爲最適宜，然而反射光綫之種類復有不同。同時顏色之配合須求心理上之安適，不可令人刺激太甚。反射光綫有三種：（一）順向反射，其光綫沿一定之直綫進行，卽射入角必等於反射角。此種光綫帶有耀光，易使巳力緊張，故以避免爲佳，例如自玻璃，磨光金屬面，鏡面等反射而來之光綫：（二）展開反射，此種光綫大概自金屬面或金屬質點反射而來者。其大部光綫循相同之方向，而並不沿同一之直綫進行，故反射後就呈展開狀，此可以使目光稍安：（三）散布反射，此種光綫爲吾人所最需要者，其反射係自普通不磨光之平面上而來，如白色之墻壁，天花板等是。光綫射至此種平面上卽被反射，四散布開，故可使強烈之光綫不刺激眼睛，達到光明悅目之要求。</p>
<p>由此覜之，光綫之配合欲使其適合於吾人之居處，並發揮建築之美觀，非對於各種光綫之心理影響與裝飾價值有相當之認識不可，同時須使各種顏色依其反射力之不同而求得一平衡之配置。此處所述不過略論其大概而已。至於光綫之配合，則普通吾人休息之所在，如寢室，客廳，以及游娛塲所如戲院等宜用和潤之光綫與悅目之顏色。強烈之光綫與有刺激性之顏色，則適用於令人興奮，活潑有爲之處。醫院內彩色之配置尤宜講求，蓋其影響病人之心理甚大，天花板之裝飾須加特別之注意。工作塲所，白光自不相宜，稻柴色或淺綠色較爲和善。而在辦公地方，學校，商店，旅館大廳，與特賴餐室之內，此數處皆需要精神充足，敏捷活潑，故白色之相當應用，自有不可泯滅之價值在也。</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government and the National Government held a joint memorial week at 9:00 AM on the 30th in the Central Auditorium. Attendees included Sun Ke, Ma Chaojun, Fu Rulin, Li Zonghuang, Xiao Jishan, Huang Fusheng, Ji Liang, and Chairman Lin of the National Government, as well as bureau chiefs Wei Huai, Mao Zhongfang, Gao Lingbai, Wen Yiyou, Yang Rumei, Fu Xuanqing, Xiao Qin, and all party workers, totaling approximately 600 people. Chairman Sun Ke presided, and Fu Rulin gave a report, stating that since the unification of water conservancy administration under the Economic Commission this year, they have relied on the Central Government's strength to work hard. The Guantai closure was completed with the help of all parties and the joint efforts of the provincial authorities, using a small amount of funds in a short period of time, proving that water conservancy administration needs to be unified. The great Yellow River disaster was due to the breach at Dongzhuang in Shandong Province, and although Shandong Province has made great efforts in flood prevention over the years, it could have been avoided in fact, but unexpectedly it still happened. In short, the Yellow River is a great disaster left to us by history, and we only seek to fully achieve human effort. Currently, the Yangtze River is also trending towards deterioration, mostly due to humans competing with water for land. If the government has the determination to calculate the overall situation and manage the Yellow River to prevent it from bursting, it may be possible to reduce disasters. After Fu's speech, the meeting adjourned. (30th, Central News Agency)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Recently, Japanese newspapers have often fabricated rumors to slander our country's national conditions. Yesterday, they fabricated the false statement that 200 members of the Blue Shirt Society had infiltrated North China to carry out activities. A Central News Agency reporter spoke with a certain Central Committee member on the 30th about this matter. The Central Committee member laughed and said that the so-called Blue Shirt Society is only a imagined organization in the minds of those with nervous problems. China simply does not have this kind of organization. The statement that 200 Blue Shirt Society members secretly went to North China is, of course, even more unfounded. The Central Committee member also said that at a time when both Chinese and Japanese authorities are mutually seeking friendship, he hopes that the Japanese press will consider any records that may hinder the feelings of both sides.

<p>(Xuzhou) The northern and southern dykes of Guanyun Chaimi suddenly breached yesterday. Water rushed into the Dingdang Rivers, and the water level of the Yan River also rose sharply. Laborers rushed to block the breaches overnight. The county government further requisitioned 20,000 laborers to rush to build the Hexi Dyke and the Dingdang East Dyke. After the breach in Shuyang, the water of the Liutang River continued to rise and was level with the top of the dyke, posing an imminent danger. The county magistrates of Dongtai and Shuyang supervised the laborers day and night to protect the dykes. (30th, Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Qingjiangpu) The breach at Dayushu in Pixian is difficult to block for the time being, and it has expanded from its original width of 60 zhang to 70 zhang. Shi Shaowu, previously sent by the Grand Canal Flood Control Office to estimate materials and construction, telegraphed from Pixian, stating that the breach is as wide as mentioned above and more than two zhang deep. There is no soil nearby to extract, making it difficult not only to fill the breach but also to estimate materials and construction until the present shoal appears. (30th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Commissioner Shao previously telegraphed the province and the Grand Canal Flood Control Office, requesting that the breach at Dayushu be blocked quickly. The Flood Control Office replied that the water from Weishan Lake has not receded, and the water volume from upstream is pouring in, converging in Pixian, making the situation increasingly intense. Blocking here and breaching there will multiply the risks, and the danger cannot be avoided. A comprehensive consideration is necessary to ensure safety. If the source of the Bulao River can be reduced, the downstream will be easier to prevent and block. Furthermore, a vast expanse of water makes it impossible to extract soil nearby. It has dispatched engineer Shi to investigate and order him to draft methods for blocking the breach for review. (30th, Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Guangzhou) The Shantou Chinese Customs authorities recently wanted to levy taxes on rice smuggled into Shantou from Taiwan. There are currently six Japanese destroyers that have sailed to Shantou to protect the lives and property of Japanese people. However, the Japanese consular authorities denied today the claim that Rear Admiral Shimomura of the Fifth Torpedo Boat Squadron is currently stationed near Guangzhou. It is said that Shimomura is still on his flagship in Shantou. This case has caused anxiety in all sectors of the Chinese community. The Japanese authorities pointed out that the provincial authorities' levy of rice taxes violates existing treaties, and said that if the Chinese authorities do not stop detaining and confiscating Japanese rice, the Japanese navy will have no choice but to carry out its duties. A Reuters correspondent learned today that the Japanese Consul General had lodged a strong protest due to the Chinese authorities detaining Japanese rice, demanding its immediate return, but the Chinese authorities did not approve it. This case occurred in mid-September, when Japanese rice worth 10,000 yuan was detained in Jieyang and Chaozhou because it was transported into the interior without paying inland taxes. There are six similar cases that have not been resolved despite negotiations by the Japanese Consul. It is found that there are more than 500 Japanese traders in Shantou, most of whom are Taiwanese.

<h3 id="e30">The Moral Problem of the Press <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>Recently, Japanese newspapers in Shanghai have fabricated news for several years. Japanese news agencies have also published many reports unfavorable to our country's political leaders. The Central News Agency has sternly defended itself. We deeply feel that this kind of groundless reporting not only causes negative results in diplomacy, but also damages the ethics of the press. More practically, the reputation of the newspaper is harmed among readers, arousing distrust. Honesty and trustworthiness is the first requirement of our profession. Without trust, it is impossible to defend oneself, let alone survive. Even if one or two newspapers have special political and economic backgrounds, newspapers survive by relying on readers. Deceiving readers, exploiting readers, and angering readers will cause readers to leave in droves. Even with special forces as their backing, what good will it do?</p>
<p>The formation of this type of fabricated news is due, on the one hand, to the fact that certain press organizations are heavily colored. They fear that their government's policies will not be completed quickly enough, and they fear that their country's people's prejudices will not be catered to vigorously enough. They do not hesitate to use the sacred press as a tool for promoting national policy and as a machine for exploiting national prejudices. On the other hand, it lies in the excessive curiosity of the press. For every kind of news, they only seek to make it bizarre and stimulating, and exaggerate it excessively to dazzle the public. Ordinary news, even if it is important in nature, is regarded as trivial. News that is harsh or eye-catching, even if it is not related to the overall situation, or is only a speculative word, is heavily promoted to stimulate readers and to show that this newspaper or agency can publish what others have not published. Therefore, such as Sino-Japanese cooperation, the official news, even if it is very important, is neglected. Linking Russia to it, the fictional speech, knowing its fictional nature, because of its freshness and strangeness, is also heavily publicized. Let us think about it. The Japanese United Press's record of Ma Zhanshan's death, how many times has it been reported and then retracted? Ma Zhanshan is not dead. The news about the Chengdu government released by the Japanese side last month has not a shred of basis. Such disrespect for journalistic ethics and tainting of our profession is not only regrettable, but also deeply hateful.</p>
<p>The press is a trust business of the people, that is, a trust business of human culture. The progress or decline of society, the security or danger of the country, and the peace or deterioration of international relations, the press is its greatest determining factor. We bear this responsibility of trust, how carefully should we act, being trustworthy and sincere, so as not to fail this great trust. If we publish unverified news for the sake of a day's brevity, the destruction of a family, the danger of a country, and the rupture of diplomatic relations are all the fault of journalists. The (London) Times of the United Kingdom, often reports news later than others, but never publishes unverified news. The New York World newspaper used to set up a "verification department," even for minor matters, it would probe many times to avoid inaccurate records. For more than 60 years, this newspaper has gained the trust of readers, also relying on this careful and precise spirit. How good are the words of Pulitzer, the owner of the New York World newspaper, "The morality of the press, the first is correctness, the second is correctness, and the second is also correctness." At a time when the poison of propaganda is permeating the world, the freedom of the press is being robbed everywhere, international animosity is increasing, and human mutual suspicion is deepening, those engaged in the press should know where to strive and not be ashamed of this sacred profession.</p>

<p>(Paris) French Premier Laval notified all cabinet members today in a personal capacity to prepare to attend an emergency cabinet meeting. It is widely believed that this move is related to the rumored British inquiry into what attitude France would adopt if Italy were to attack the British fleet without provocation or other naval engagements were to occur. The upcoming emergency cabinet meeting is probably the reason why Naval Minister Piétri cannot attend the launch ceremony of the battlecruiser Dunkerque. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Paris) French Naval Minister Piétri's decision not to attend the launch ceremony of France's first post-war cruiser, the Dunkerque, on October 2nd in Brest has caused some surprise. Piétri stated today that actions should not be mixed with noise at this time. He believes that the timing of the launch ceremony for this ship is particularly ill-chosen for France. He will be unable to leave Paris to attend the cabinet meeting due to some important matter at the time of the ceremony. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Paris) On September 10th, the French government, through its ambassador to the United Kingdom, Corbin, raised a question with the British government: "If there is a situation in Europe in the future where a country violates the League of Nations Covenant and resorts to force, can France be assured that Britain will immediately implement the sanctions stipulated in Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant with effective means?" British Foreign Secretary Hoare addressed a reply to French Ambassador Corbin on September 26th, the full text of which has recently been released by the French Foreign Ministry. The reply is divided into four sections, outlining its main points as follows:</p>
<p>Hoare first mentioned his speech at the League of Nations Assembly on September 11th, saying, "At that time, I declared that all member states of the League of Nations should fulfill the obligations stipulated in the League of Nations Covenant to the best of their ability. The British government is in no way behind other countries in this spirit and determination. At that time, I also said that the ideals contained in the League of Nations Covenant, especially the desire to establish norms for international events, are in harmony with the idealist nature of the British people. The British people believe in it more and more, and it has become part of the British national consciousness."</p>
<p>The reply continued, "Some people believe that Britain has not had a firm and unwavering loyalty to the League of Nations and everything it advocates in the past. I refuted this in my speech at the League of Nations Assembly. I pointed out the various reactions of recent British public opinion to draw the world's attention to how the British people unanimously support the government in fully accepting the obligations of League of Nations member states. Britain has always taken the acceptance of this obligation as the basis of its foreign policy and has repeatedly proclaimed it to the world. As for the idea that Britain's claim and policy are specifically for the Italo-Ethiopian dispute and have other intentions, it can be said to be completely misunderstood and inconsistent with the facts. I now take this opportunity to reiterate responsibly that what the British people have repeatedly expressed is the principle of the League of Nations, without any other special motive. Any other interpretation besides this would be tantamount to harming Britain's good faith and doubting Britain's sincerity. Why would I repeat it so many times to clarify that the League of Nations Covenant has clear provisions for the obligations of member states, which Britain will always support and collectively maintain all the provisions of the Covenant, and especially for all unprovoked acts of aggression, should be resolutely and collectively resisted. I believe that all League of Nations member states cannot predetermine their policies for any particular event. The above-mentioned few words are more clear and firm, which should be agreed upon by the general public. Therefore, the above-mentioned 'all unprovoked acts of aggression' refer to general cases and do not refer to any particular event. This level must be noted for its full meaning. The procedure of Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant is only used to deal with positive actions, while it does not apply to negative actions that cannot fulfill the treaty provisions. Furthermore, the so-called 'resort to force' has different degrees of severity and different degrees of aggression, which is also very obvious. Therefore, the nature of the action taken in accordance with Article 16 of the Covenant should be different in each case, in other words, it should vary according to the circumstances of each particular event. As far as I know, the French government recognizes this distinction."</p>
<p>"In addition, regarding treaty obligations, I also discussed them at the League of Nations Assembly, and it is okay to declare them again. I believe that flexibility is a part of security. The world is by no means static, which is recognized by the League of Nations Covenant, and especially by the member states."</p>
<p>The reply then stated that the principles listed above represent the policy of the current British cabinet. As for whether any future British cabinet will adopt this policy, there is no need to be bound by it. "However, my speech in Geneva, although representing the current government, is actually supported by the majority of the British people. The main point of my speech is to support the general principles of international behavior. If the League of Nations remains an effective organization, then the UK's position will remain unchanged. My speech represents the unwavering feelings of the British people, which is further confirmed by the attitude of British public opinion in recent weeks. Moreover, in the opinion of the British government and people, in order to avoid the meaningless disasters of the past and ensure the peace and collective security of the future world, the League of Nations is the only real hope. If we lose our faith in the League of Nations, if we refuse to take effective action for the ideals of the League of Nations, and cause the League of Nations to fall into a weak and incompetent position, it will inevitably lead to a great mistake. The so-called faith, the so-called action, and security are the same, and must be collective. At this critical juncture, I should reiterate a sentence from my Geneva speech as a conclusion: 'If we risk for peace, we must go together.'

<p>(Paris) French officials expressed their opinion on the British reply to Reuters reporters, saying that they were completely satisfied and that the reply was very practical. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Hoare's reply to France has aroused unanimous support from British newspapers today, recognizing this as a clear indication of Britain's determination to uphold the Covenant while the League of Nations Covenant is still in effect, and saying that this reply to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's statement in the Gazzetta del Popolo on Saturday that Italy is prepared to negotiate an agreement with Britain that is suitable for Britain's legitimate interests in Ethiopia is also very sufficient. The Italian cabinet's communique is widely regarded as being directed at the British people and has nothing to do with the British government, so British officials may ignore it. The Daily Express said that this communique contains profound meaning, intending to create the impression that this dispute is purely a matter of satisfaction and that the League of Nations is neutral. If the Italian Prime Minister makes such divisive remarks again, the League of Nations will give a collective response. The Daily Mail mentioned the saying that Italy may withdraw from the League of Nations, meaning that even if this happens, the League of Nations will not flinch. The Morning Post said that Mussolini's move is very much like a thief promising to divide the spoils with the police to get them to leave their posts. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The newspapers here unanimously expressed satisfaction with Britain's reply to France on the issue of collective security. The newspapers claimed that the British note had many loopholes. For example, if British Foreign Secretary Hoare believed that Article 16 of the Covenant only referred to positive actions and could not be used to punish countries that violated treaties, then he only pointed out the shortcomings of the Covenant. Le Journal also said that the note was disappointing, and that the British were trying to evade their obligations to France. (National Telegraph, 30th)</p>
<h3 id="e39">British Labour Party Holds Important Annual Conference to Decide on Sanctions Issue and Party Leader Election <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>(London) The Labour Party is holding an important annual conference in Brighton today. Its agenda includes the issue of sanctions and who should be the future party leader. Although the issue of sanctions has caused serious divisions among party members, Chairman Lansbury firmly announced his support for sanctions in his opening speech. Lansbury said that the Labour Party must not retreat from the ethical aspect. If the League of Nations fails in this crisis, it will only destroy itself and the hope of all countries. Then, there will be no justice to speak of in the world, and imperialism will run rampant under this cover, and dictators will be unscrupulous. Organized labor does not believe that it will plunge into the whirlpool of human war. If war breaks out one day, strict implementation of the supply of war materials will surely bring it to an end. However, if Italy resists the League of Nations, then the League of Nations will have no other choice but to use force to threaten to stop Italy's foreign aggression. The sanctions issue has been discussed countless times in private recently in order to reconcile the different opinions of the various factions. Attlee and the Executive Committee led by Morrison support the resolutions recently passed by the Trade Union Congress in Margate, and are now working hard to support the League of Nations in fully using force to stop Italy. However, the faction led by Lansbury, a senior leader of the Labour Party in the House of Commons, opposes the use of any force. Cripps and the Socialist League also criticized the League of Nations as "imperialist thieves" and demanded that a general assembly of the labor movement be convened to decide on the attitude that should be taken towards the war. Labour leaders now all agree to reject Cripps. The moderate faction is deeply concerned that sanctions will lead to a world war and has reportedly been gaining momentum in recent weeks. However, it is expected that the majority of the Labour Party will vote in favor of implementing sanctions. This matter may be predetermined. Lansbury's position is very difficult in this situation, but no one wants him to retire now. It is said that Lansbury does not want to take any action before consulting with the Parliamentary Labour Party. The power to choose the Labour Party leader is now entirely in the hands of the Labour Party members of Parliament. The agenda of the conference also includes a request to abolish the House of Lords, which is a must-have in the historical agenda, and a request to nationalize all national banks, and criticize the Crown Prince's recent remarks in support of officer training corps. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(London) Lansbury, leader of the Labour Party group in the House of Commons, recently issued a declaration saying, "If the League of Nations and Italy engage in mutually hostile acts, it is almost certain that it will become the prelude to the Second World War. Once the war breaks out, it will inevitably destroy civilization and religion. Some say that this action of the League of Nations is like a punishment by the representative of the law for those who violate the law. I alone believe that no one has the right to control the lives of others." (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3 id="e40">Abyssinia Issues General Mobilization Order; Number of People Around 500,000 <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Addis Ababa The Emperor of Abyssinia believes that war is inevitable. After hesitating for several weeks, he finally approved the mobilization order today. However, in order to respect the League of Nations, it will not be made public for the time being. The whole country has been eagerly awaiting the approval of the mobilization order for the past two months. Now hearing this news is a comfort, because all Abyssinian people with a little thought believe that Abyssinia will sooner or later go to war with Italy. After the Emperor of Abyssinia approved the mobilization order, he received a report stating that a total of 30,000 Italian and Eritrean soldiers, carrying 70 tanks and many machine guns, are gathering around Mount Mussari, where the borders of Abyssinia, Eritrea, and French Somaliland meet, preparing to cross the Aoussa Plain and attack.</p>
<p>The French authorities have rushed to send reinforcements to defend the border. At the same time, a Swedish military officer has arrived in Awash, a place on the railway between Addis Ababa and Djibouti, to take charge of defending the road bridges to resist aerial bombing. A thousand elite soldiers are carrying anti-aircraft guns to command them. Many chieftains have already been conscripted, and the total number of soldiers currently enlisted is about 250,000. Therefore, this general mobilization will involve about 500,000 people. The completion of the mobilization procedures will not take much time, because the people have already received notices of where to report once mobilization is ordered, and the chieftains have received instructions from the Emperor of Abyssinia regarding where the troops should be sent.</p>
<p>The women of the whole country were very quiet when they heard the news of the approval of the mobilization order. They are now preparing for men to be loyal to the country. It is said that many women have already persuaded their men to volunteer to enlist. It is said that 50 Eritrean soldiers recruited by the Italian side brought 50 rifles, 8 machine guns, and some bullets today and fled to Abyssinia to surrender. They were disarmed, but will be incorporated into the Abyssinian army. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa The Emperor of Abyssinia issued a general mobilization order today on Tuesday and has telegraphed the League of Nations, declaring that it cannot be delayed any longer. Then, as soon as the order is issued, the whole country will be filled with the sound of war drums, and 1.25 million warriors will be ready to pay for the aggression of the army. The Emperor of Abyssinia today discussed everything with his foreign military advisors. It is reported that Abyssinia's strategy calls for dispersing the national army to every square mile with 600 people to guard, and using the advantages of familiarity with the terrain and courageous warfare to resist the Italian army's tactics. Moreover, this plan can also reduce the weakness of poor equipment. (National Telegraph, 25th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The atmosphere of Abyssinia about to lead the mobilization seems to have made this person hesitate and think about waiting not lightly for Abyssinia, but seriously for the fact that Abyssinia can levy 1 million soldiers, and that the country has only 250,000 troops in the Italian territories. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Rome) After the Emperor of Abyssinia decided to issue a general mobilization order, the Piccolo newspaper here specially added: "The peace mask worn by Abyssinia has been removed. Dare I ask what the League of Nations can do at this time? It should be known that there are 1 million people in Abyssinia who can attack Italian territories. With the help of, it can attack the Italian army from both sides of the country's border. Then, it is not difficult to see who is threatening and who is preparing to attack."

<p>(Rome) Roman newspapers today, in accordance with the spirit of the communique issued by the cabinet on Saturday, claimed that today's conflict is not only between Italy and the League of Nations or between Italy and Abyssinia, but between Italy and Britain. Commentator Gayda accused Britain of instigating the League of Nations to make things difficult for Italy, otherwise the League of Nations' intervention would not be so aggressive. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The British side here believes that the British attitude mentioned in the Italian government's announcement on Saturday is completely wrong. Britain has repeatedly expressed its attitude as a member of the League of Nations to Italy. On February 23rd, the British Ambassador to Italy, Drummond, notified the Italian government, informing it that acts of force or aggression against Abyssinia would have a serious impact on British public opinion. On April 30th, the Italian Ambassador to Britain, Grandi, also received the same warning here. On May 22nd, Ambassador Drummond reiterated this warning to the Italian government.

<p>(Geneva) The Emperor of Abyssinia notified the Council of the League of Nations on the 25th of this month, requesting that a fact-finding mission be dispatched to the border of the country to determine the responsibility for the aggression. It should be entrusted to Saint-Quentin, the Deputy Director of the African Department of the French Foreign Ministry, Thompson, the Director of the Egyptian Department of the British Foreign Ministry, and Ariwen, the Spanish representative, by the Committee of Thirteen of the Council to discuss the implementation plan. According to information obtained by our agency's interviewers, the results of their consultation are that they believe that this request from the Emperor of Abyssinia has geographical and technical difficulties and cannot be complied with.

This speculation is probably related to the current visit of Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös to Germany. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Central Executive Committee of the World League of Nations Supporters recently held an important meeting here to discuss various political issues. The Dutch committee proposed that the German government's recently promulgated laws regarding the status of Jews in the country be submitted to the Legal and Political Committee for review. The Executive Committee then discussed the Abyssinian dispute. The Italian committee member Giannini explained the opinion of the Italian committee, saying that this dispute is not within the scope of the League of Nations Covenant. After all, Italy has an overpopulation and insufficient raw materials, and it is necessary to develop outwards. This dispute is actually one stage of Italy's outward development and is an unavoidable stage. As for the goals of outward development, densely populated areas that still have various raw materials to be taken are suitable, because these raw materials are indispensable for modern life in the development. At this point, the British committee member Lady Gladstone stood up and spoke, saying that the system of collective security established by the League of Nations Covenant should not be shaken and needs to be strengthened. Then, the Belgian committee submitted a draft resolution, in which the members of each country’s committee all supported the principle of collective security and were satisfied. The committee members of each country must step up publicity so that the public can clearly understand that the Abyssinian dispute has a profound impact on the future of the League of Nations and urge them to firmly advocate the implementation of the League of Nations Covenant. This draft resolution was voted on and passed. Among the 18 committee countries, 14 voted in favor, 1 voted against, and 2 abstained. (Havas dispatch, 30th)</p>

When Gömbös and Göring arrived at the Premier's Office, the crowds in the street warmly welcomed them. A team of honor guards also beat drums in front of the Premier's Office to pay tribute to the Hungarian Prime Minister. Gömbös visited Army Commander General von Blomberg this morning, and then accompanied his entourage and members of the Hungarian Embassy to the Memorial Arch for the War Dead to present wreaths.

<p>(Warsaw) Hitler's confidant and the special envoy for disarmament issues Ribbentrop is scheduled to come to Poland in early October to engage in inquiries. The political circles are extremely concerned about this visit. It is rumored that Ribbentrop intends to negotiate with the Polish authorities and conclude a pact against Czechoslovakia, although the responsible parties have denied it, but some parties believe that Ribbentrop's visit may not be limited to hunting. This has caused unease in the opposition party regarding the current tense relationship between the countries. It is reported that Soviet Russia has concluded a treaty with Romania, stipulating that in the event of war in the future, Soviet troops may go to Czechoslovakia through Romanian territory. Also, Soviet Russia concluded a mutual assistance pact with Czechoslovakia in May of this year. (Havas dispatch, 30th)</p>

<p>The election for the Memel Parliament was originally scheduled to end yesterday, but due to different voting arrangements, it was necessary to extend the voting from 8:00 AM this morning until 6:00 PM tonight. There were minor conflicts yesterday. In a village on the German border, not far from Memel, Germans and Lithuanians engaged in a brawl, resulting in five injuries. Yesterday at 6:00 PM, the original closing time for voting, seventy-six polling places were still surrounded by voters waiting to vote. Fortunately, the cabinet held an emergency meeting and quickly issued a notice extending the voting time. It was later decided that the polling places would remain open today, thus preventing serious disputes from erupting. Yesterday, some people waited for seven hours without being able to vote. Most Germans ridiculed this farcical situation. German and Lithuanian personnel managing the polling places had some unimportant quarrels yesterday. (20th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Memel: The Lithuanian Cabinet today revised the election law, so Memel will continue the election from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM tomorrow. Because voting is very slow, no more than eighty voters can pass through a polling station per hour. Therefore, in electoral districts with more than one thousand voters, it is impossible to complete voting within the twelve hours stipulated by the election law. Voting began at 8:00 AM this morning, but at 7:00 AM, voters were already lined up in front of the polling stations. The majority of people in the streets are Lithuanian, and order is maintained by Lithuanians, not the Memel police. It is reported that Lithuanian police, at the request of the Memel Electoral Commission, entered the Memel City Government last night. The Memel ballots are now entirely in the hands of the Lithuanian police. (29th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Memel: The voting results will not be announced until tomorrow evening. The reason for extending the voting time is that German voters deliberately obstructed the voting, causing the voting to proceed slowly. Most German voters first gathered at the entrance of the polling station and took half an hour to enter the polling station. Then, they lined up at the entrance of the polling station and entered in an orderly manner. At some polling stations, up to five hundred people were waiting in line. Many Lithuanian farmers returned home after waiting for four hours without being able to vote. Therefore, the authorities initially announced that the voting would be extended until nighttime and then decided to continue voting tomorrow. Today, diplomatic representatives from the United Kingdom, France, and Italy, who guarantee the autonomy of Memel, were present to observe. (29th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Berlin) At the time of the reorganization of the Memel Autonomous Parliament, Führer Hitler took a train to East Prussia last night in a state of embarrassment. Political figures were surprised to hear this news, because since taking office, the Führer has crossed the Polish Corridor to go to East Prussia, this is still the first time. Some people interpret the Führer's visit as a sign of opposition to Lithuania. The general public also expects the Führer to deliver a speech to the Germanic people in the Memel region tomorrow. It is also heard that according to the planned itinerary, Hitler will go to Tannenberg in East Prussia on October 2nd to attend the reburial ceremony of the late President Hindenburg, who passed away last year. After his death, he was buried under the general's tower in that place. The reburial will take place on that day in the final determined tomb. (30th Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>Karlsruhe, Germany: A joint military-civilian celebration was held here recently. Propaganda Minister Goebbels attended and delivered a speech, elaborating on various domestic and foreign issues in Germany. First, regarding the Jewish question, he said that it should be resolved by the state. The House of Representatives had already passed a law on determining the status of Jews at a meeting in Nuremberg on the 15th of this month. Once the government issues implementing regulations based on this law, any Jew who still cannot behave and abide by the law is an enemy of the state and should be punished by the state. As for the church dispute, the current world situation is so tense that the state must have complete control over the strength of the entire country. This is not only true in terms of military organization, but also in preserving moral resistance. Therefore, no riots should occur among the German people due to religious disputes. In short, the church can preach peacefully in the church, and we should preach to the people on the podium. Although we do not interfere with each other, we must jointly preserve the political unity of the country and not allow it to be damaged in the slightest." Goebbels then mentioned the Memel region, saying, "If there are no law-abiding people in the world, there is no need to talk about the law. Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations was based on this view, because the League of Nations treats National Socialist Germany in the same way it treated the Weimar Republic after the Great War. Since the League of Nations despises the legitimate demands of the new Germany, Germany disdains to interact with it." (30th Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>(Washington) The White House today, during President Roosevelt's tour, released a revised budget for the federal government for 1937, intending to balance the government's revenue and expenditure without increasing taxes. The White House also issued a presidential announcement, which did not explicitly state the timing of the budget balance, but stated that it could not be achieved before 1938 at the earliest. The total expenditure in the revised budget is $7,752,332,000, while the original budget was $8,520,413,609. The total revenue in the revised budget is $4,470,349,140, while the original budget was $3,991,904,639. The difference between revenue and expenditure is $3,281,982,860 in the new budget, while the original budget was $4,528,508,970. The President also said that the government's tax base is now more solid than before, because ordinary commercial income can generate considerable tax revenue to meet all necessary purposes. The gap between revenue and expenditure in next year's budget has been greatly reduced, so the government will not need to implement new taxes or increase existing tax rates. A spokesperson on the side believes that the government's revised budget this time is the first step towards balancing the budget. (29th National News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt today made optimistic remarks about the US budget for the 1935-1936 fiscal year, saying that the budget figures indicate that the economic situation is better than in the past three years. He also said that current industrial production and trade are still expanding, and it is expected that the shortfall in 1936-1937 can be reduced compared to the past, and there is no need to greatly increase taxes. As for the shortfall in 1935-1936, it was purely due to temporary expenditures, and most of this expenditure was used for unemployment relief. The 1937 budget is currently being prepared, and efforts are being made to reduce the distance between revenue and expenditure, so the government can avoid proposing new methods to make up for necessary expenses and recover public debt under the current tax plan. President Roosevelt estimated that the shortfall in 1935-1936 would be about 300 million yuan lower than in 1924-1935. Various handling fees will continue to be collected, but if the court accepts lawsuits against this plan, it will encounter the difficulty of finding other ways to collect taxes to meet special expenses. The total shortfall for 1935-1936 is about $3,281,000,000. Excluding the recovery of national debt, the net shortfall is $2,731,000,000. The progress of the work relief program is indeed slower than he hoped, but it is being accelerated. In the coming months, it should be able to provide sufficient work for the unemployed. The estimated revenue for 1925-1936 is $4,470,000,000, and the expenditure is $7,752,000,000. It is also estimated that the total public debt on June 20, 1936, will be $30,723,000,000, which is $2,023,000,000 less than the total public debt on June 30, 1926. Local people believe that President Roosevelt's statement that he does not intend to propose new taxes at present means that President Roosevelt does intend to give the industry some breathing room.

<p>(Washington) According to experts here, if a major war breaks out in Europe, the use of silver, nickel, and other metals in European countries will greatly increase, because cash is concentrated in the United States, and it is already in short supply elsewhere. According to the latest announcement from the US Federal Reserve, the United States currently holds as much as 9.23 billion yuan in cash. Currently, there is still 16.3 million yuan in cash en route to the United States. In summary, of the world's monetary gold, which is about 21.6 billion yuan, the United States holds 43%, France currently has 22%, and the rest is divided among the countries of the world. If the UK and Italy participate in the war in the future, they will certainly not be able to borrow from the United States again. Therefore, experts believe that these countries may use other metals as substitutes or issue more banknotes, implementing inflation. As for the amount of silver reserves in the UK, according to the latest unofficial estimate, it is worth about 70 million pounds. The silver reserves in Italy are worth about 50 million US dollars. Although most of these silver reserves can be minted into subsidiary coins, they will not be sufficient for wartime use. Therefore, paper money or other substitute metals may be used at that time.

<h3 id="e91">Qin-Yu Area: Smuggling Ring Discovered; Specializing in Transporting Tax-Evading Smuggled Goods for Sale Inside the Pass; Customs Enforcement Resists with Force <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Communication: Within Dongluocheng in Yuguan, there is recently an organization called Xiehe Trading House, managed by Japanese and puppet personnel. Outwardly, it is a transshipment agency, but in reality, it specializes in smuggling operations. What is transported out of the pass are silver bullion, silver coins, and banknotes from the Central Bank and Bank of Communications. What is transported into the pass are goods like ramie yarn, sugar, and rayon. Rumors circulate that a smuggling kingdom has recently emerged between Qin and Yu, and this place serves as its headquarters. In the smuggling ring, people of all nationalities are involved. Each smuggling run consists of three to five or seven to eight people, equipped with weapons. When customs enforcement personnel discover them, they immediately resist with force, almost equivalent to the bandits of a few years ago. In late last month, Qin Island customs personnel seized a large quantity of smuggled rayon. Six or seven customs officers were brutally beaten nearly to death by dozens of ruffians. This is proof of this. Customs anti-smuggling patrol boats, while patrolling at sea, are repeatedly attacked by smuggling vessels. Therefore, since March of this year, the Qin Island customs patrol boats Beijiang and Yulin (each weighing fifty tons) have been equipped with weapons to defend themselves in cases of emergency. Unexpectedly, on September 18, when the two ships sailed back to the Qin Island pier from the Yantai sea area, they were suddenly subjected to the local Japanese military police forcibly confiscating their weapons. One machine gun and ten rifles on each ship were taken away. Customs Commissioner Hao Gede protested to the military police captain Takimoto, which resulted in the release of the ships. However, the Yulin's engine was damaged at some unknown time, and was only repaired and left the port on the 25th. According to the Japanese side, within the war zone, except for the security forces who are allowed to carry arms, other groups and agencies are not allowed to be armed. The customs patrol boats having weapons seems to conflict with the war zone agreement, so they must be confiscated. While this may sound reasonable, in reality, it only weakens the customs patrol force, allowing smuggling vessels to come and go without hindrance in the future. Qin Island Naval Customs Commissioner Hao Gede came to Tianjin on the 27th to meet with Tianjin Customs Superintendent Han Linsheng and Customs Commissioner Baus, to discuss future smuggling prevention measures. It has been decided that all card patrol personnel within the jurisdiction of Qinhuangdao Customs will be rotated with Tianjin Customs employees every six months to prevent smugglers from becoming familiar with their faces and taking unfavorable actions.</p>
<p>A pro-Japanese merchant shop in a certain Tianjin concession is entrusted by smuggling rings to sell their tax-evading goods on one hand, and to collect silver bullion on the other, which is then carried to Shanhaiguan by Korean ruffians. Although the exact amount cannot be determined, the frequency of Korean travelers heading east every day suggests that a considerable amount is being transported. On the 27th of this month, a tragic incident occurred due to smuggling. At 9:15 AM on that day, the Pingyu express train No. 41, traveling from Tianjin to the east, was moving slowly as it departed from the East Station. A Korean man, about thirty years old, carrying a suitcase, frantically ran to catch the train. However, because the suitcase was too heavy and he couldn't run fast enough, one foot had already stepped onto the train steps, but his grip wasn't secure, and he slipped and fell onto the tracks, where he was crushed to death. The scene was gruesome. After the incident, it was found that the suitcase contained 900 silver coins, covered with clothing. The body was taken away by the Korean Residents Association of Tianjin. Because he died due to his own carelessness, no further statement was made. (28th)</p>
<h3 id="e92">Anti-Chinese Sentiment in Siam Intensifies; Heavy Military Taxes Levied on Chinese-Owned Rice Mills; Forced Employment of Siamese Workers; Overseas Chinese Students Prohibited from Wearing Chinese Clothing <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: Anti-Chinese sentiment in Siam has intensified recently. Initially, overseas Chinese schools were targeted, with mandatory teaching of Siamese in local Chinese schools. Then, local Chinese schools were closed down, and Chinese teachers were expelled from the country. Our country's negotiations with them have been ineffective. The Siamese government, believing they have the upper hand, takes things further. Recently, they have started targeting the commercial and industrial sectors, ostracizing overseas Chinese. They are imposing heavy taxes on rice mills and restricting the employment of Chinese workers, aiming to suffocate their businesses and drive them to ruin, in order to achieve their annexation plan. Returned overseas Chinese from here have established an "Aid Siam Association" to assist the overseas Chinese there and to petition the government to immediately negotiate seriously with the Siamese government to relieve the plight of the overseas Chinese there. The Aid Siam Association yesterday again received two telegrams from overseas Chinese groups in Siam, reporting on the situation of the Siamese government oppressing Chinese workers, which is infuriating. The two telegrams are appended below: (1) "To the Overseas Chinese Associations Committee for Assisting Fellow Overseas Chinese in Siam, Guangzhou: The Siamese government has absolutely no sincerity in revising the harsh anti-Chinese regulations. The slowness of our government's negotiations and the decline of the national spirit have further provoked their brutal intentions. In mid-September, they promulgated extremely severe harsh regulations: 1. Chinese-owned rice mills must allocate half of their annual profits to the Siamese Navy and Air Force. 2. Overseas Chinese in Siam must not engage in any acts that insult the Japanese. 3. Overseas Chinese students are not allowed to wear Chinese clothing. 4. Siamese workers must account for seven-tenths of all workers in Chinese-owned rice mills throughout Siam. Our overseas Chinese are now planning countermeasures day and night. In addition to continuing to send telegrams to our government requesting negotiations, there will be a joint petition during the day. Otherwise, all overseas Chinese will go on strike to achieve success. We deeply hope that your association will provide concrete assistance and awaken the Chinese people to support us unanimously. The overseas Chinese in Siam are extremely fortunate, and the country and the nation are extremely fortunate. We anxiously await your orders, the United Association of Overseas Chinese in Siam, respectful salute, Yang Yin." (2) Telegram from the Rice Mill Workers' Union of Overseas Chinese in Siam: "(Omitted heading) The Siamese government's expulsion of overseas Chinese is becoming increasingly severe. Past actions have not ceased, and new ones are even more intense. It has been found that in mid-September, a new and extremely severe oppression was imposed, requiring all Chinese-owned rice mills in Siam to replace seven-tenths of their workers with Siamese workers, and to allocate half of their annual profits to the Siamese Navy and Air Force. We and others are facing unprecedented pressure and are determined to resist to the death. Otherwise, the disaster will be even greater. Therefore, we have jointly organized a petition delegation with the overseas Chinese rice mills in Siam to negotiate forcefully in order to abolish this. We deeply hope that the officials of the authorities will sympathize with the plight of the overseas Chinese and make serious representations to the Siamese government, and awaken the Chinese people to unite and assist us. We look to the sea and sky, crying out in agony. We eagerly await your urgent response, the Rice Mill Workers' Union of Overseas Chinese in Siam, respectful salute, Geng Yin."

<h3 id="e93">The Tragic State of the Yellow River Flood in Pi County: 90% of the Entire County Submerged; Water Conservancy Agencies Neglect Prevention <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Pi County Communication: Pi County is located in the northern border of Jiangsu Province, with a low-lying terrain and crisscrossing rivers. The summer floods from southern Shandong all use Pi County as their final outlet. Disasters occur nine out of ten years. The residents are impoverished, making it the poorest county in Jiangsu Province. This summer, the Yellow River flooded, flowing from western Shandong into Zhaoyang and Weishan Lakes, and then directly into Pi County through the Grand Canal and the Bulao River. Therefore, the flood disaster in this area is more severe than in any other county. It was found that from the beginning of August this year, the Grand Canal and the Bulao River simultaneously started to rise, but it was very gradual, and the people did not pay attention. The county government, following provincial orders, focused all its efforts on repairing the south bank of the Bulao River, and tacitly abandoned other dikes. By late August, when the main flood arrived, the people spontaneously started repairing the dikes on both sides of the Grand Canal. All the people in the county, all the able-bodied men, and County Magistrate Qin Jieren led personnel from various agencies to supervise the work day and night, without rest. However, due to the vastness of the project and the lack of manpower, coupled with strong winds and heavy rain, the waves rose rapidly. The banks of the Bulao River and the Grand Canal gradually collapsed, and 90% of the entire county was submerged. The new school buildings of the Provincial Grand Canal Rural Normal School mostly collapsed. Countless houses in various villages were toppled. The late autumn crops, mostly ripe, were all submerged because the people were busy day and night preventing the Yellow River flood and had no time to harvest. This is especially regrettable. In addition, this spring, hailstorms caused damage, and most of the winter wheat was destroyed. In some areas south of Pi County, not a single grain was harvested. The autumn harvest, on which they depended for their livelihood, was also lost. The 600,000 people of Pi County truly have nowhere to die. Moreover, the floodwater is several feet deep on the plains, and there is no way to escape. Whenever there is a strong wind, the waves rise, and houses collapse. The sounds of disaster echo through the land, too horrible to bear. Dozens of people drown themselves every day. If the government does not provide relief soon or resettle the people to cultivate new lands, the old and weak will inevitably perish in the bellies of fish, and the young and strong will inevitably resort to desperate measures. This is what the government should pay particular attention to. However, since the founding of the Republic of China, Pi County has paid over 10,000 yuan in levies for Grand Canal management every year, but the Jiangsu Grand Canal Engineering Bureau has never moved an inch of soil for the people of Pi in peacetime, nor has it taken a single cent from the people of Pi in times of crisis. The expenses for flood prevention in Pi are all self-funded, so as not to add disaster upon disaster. If the Grand Canal had been dredged slightly beforehand, and if the Huai River Conservancy Commission had not built dams at the lower reaches to confine the water, the flood situation in Pi County would not have been so severe. Although this disaster was due to natural causes, human factors also played a significant role. The people of Pi truly cannot help but feel resentment.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Jiangxi-Hunan Border: Large-Scale Suppression of Remnant Bandits; Pingxiang, Yichun, Pingjiang, and Liuyang Resume Blockade <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Nanchang Communication: Currently, only two relatively rampant groups of remnant bandits remain in Jiangxi. One is the remnants of Fang Zhimin's bandits, who are roaming the borders of Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and are being encircled and suppressed by Wei Lihuang, who is leading the armies of three provinces. The other is the remnants of Gao Yongsheng, Zhang Tao, and Xu Yangang, who are appearing in the mountainous areas bordering Pingjiang, Liuyang, Yichun, Pingxiang, Tonggu, Xiushui, and Yangxin. They are being encircled and suppressed by Chen Jicheng, who is leading the forces of the Jiangxi-Hubei-Hunan border area. Except for the Tonggu area, which is still a blockade zone, the remote mountainous areas of Cihua, Huayuan, and Lishi in Yichun and Pingxiang have also seen the influx of Red Bandits, who are smuggling supplies. Commander Tan Daoyuan of the area believes that cutting off the bandits' supplies is extremely important during this large-scale suppression. He therefore obtained approval from the Pacification Commissioner's Office to resume the blockade of the bandit areas bordering Yichun, Pingxiang, Pingjiang, and Liuyang, ensuring that no oil, salt, cloth, medicine, hardware, or any daily necessities can flow into the hands of the bandits to cut off their supplies. As for Kong Hechong, the Commander of the Border Pacification of the three provinces, he is recruiting surrendered scattered bandits and rewarding self-reform in the Xiang-E-Gan border area. The number of surrenders is increasing daily, and the number of bandit weapons seized is also increasing.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Anhui Salt Taxation Divided into Zones; Yangzhou Petition Representatives Return to Beijing to Negotiate <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu Communication: Chen Jiqian, the Chief of the Anhui Salt Affairs Inspection Office, following the orders of the Salt Affairs Administration of the Ministry of Finance, revised the method of paying salt taxes on the Anhui side. After this news spread, salt merchants gathered to discuss that this revision would greatly hinder the transportation and sale of Huai salt. In the past, it was convenient for all salt merchants on the shore to distribute the goods according to the number of tickets. However, if the new regulation is changed once, it will be unfavorable for the transportation and sales. Therefore, more than 20 representatives from salt merchants in Yangzhou came to Yan several days ago and petitioned the Anhui Salt Affairs Inspection Office for several days. Regarding the tax payment procedures, they requested that they still be handled according to the previous regulations, in order to ease the merchants' difficulties. Chief Chen Jiqian said that the amendment was carried out by order, and was of a trial nature. The request of the salt merchants could not be accepted immediately. However, if there are difficulties in taxation in the future, he will report it for review and instructions. It is heard that the office has now decided on a method of collecting taxes in a centralized manner, dividing the province into five major zones. Wuhu is the first zone, Datong is the second zone, Yuncao is the third zone, Hefei is the fourth zone, and Shelaiquan is the fifth zone. Wuhu Zone will be the first to be tried, and if it is effective, it will be extended to other zones. This method will be implemented at a meeting of all salt merchants after it is submitted to the Salt Affairs Administration of the Ministry of Finance for approval. It is heard that some salt merchants have tacitly acknowledged this, while another group left Wuhu for Beijing today (29th) to conduct further negotiations with the Salt Affairs Administration.

<h3 id="e97">Gōng County Grottoes, Famous Like Yique and Yungang, are Collapsing; Hu Shiqing and Others Form a Preservation Association <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Kaifeng Communication: The stone carvings of the Gōng County Grottoes in western Henan were created during the Northern Wei Dynasty. Like Yique in Luoyang and Yungang in Datong, they are magnificent spectacles in the world. Their carving techniques are neither entirely based on Chinese traditions nor imitations of Indian relics. They are the result of the gradual integration of the heroic spirit of the Xianbei people, the spirit of Buddhism, and the culture of the Central Plains, resulting in greater ingenuity. Therefore, their exquisite carvings are considered by commentators to be models of Buddhist art in the world, with extremely high value, attracting the covetousness of both Chinese and foreigners. Theft has occurred from time to time. In the past, local gentry Liu Maochan built walls to protect them. Unfortunately, on June 8th of this year, the Luo River overflowed, causing great disaster to the temple. The walls and houses were completely destroyed. As a result, theft has become rampant recently. If measures are not taken to protect them, they will not only be eroded by water but may also be completely lost. Witnessing this situation, Liu came to Kaifeng to discuss protection measures with leading figures from political and academic circles. As a result, he joined Hu Shiqing and others to organize the "Committee for the Preservation of Grottoes and Ancient Relics," located in the Henan Museum. On the 19th, Hu Shiqing, Zhang Zhongfu, and more than 20 others were elected as organizing committee members, and Zhang Zhonglu, Qi Xingyi, Guan Baiyi, Hu Shiqing, Liu Maochan, Liu Xiwu, and Liang Chengqi were elected as standing committee members, with Guan Baiyi as chairman and Xu Yanlu and Bai Zeyuan as secretaries. They are actively proceeding to determine a preservation plan, raise funds, and engage in construction and repair. It is also planned to establish a library and public garden within the temple, so that visitors can appreciate the ancient relics and also enjoy reading and relaxing.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Shandong Province Establishes Regional Farms <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Provincial government passes general regulations and budget to consolidate economic strength and promote agricultural production and organization</p>
<p>Jinan Communication: The Department of Construction has determined that the agricultural experiment stations that each county had in the past have failed to adequately enhance agricultural production and promotion due to limitations in manpower and financial resources. Therefore, it has decided to discontinue the county experiment stations and concentrate funding to establish regional experiment stations in four zones across the province. These stations will manage agricultural trials and conduct agricultural surveys and promotion within their respective zones. This plan was originally intended to be implemented starting in fiscal year 24, but it has not yet been established due to more complicated preparatory procedures. According to the original plan, the locations for the regional experiment stations were to be Tai'an in the first zone, Huimin in the second zone, Ju County in the third zone, and Laiyang in the fourth zone. Later, Shandong University's College of Agriculture cooperated with the Department of Construction and Department of Education to organize an Agricultural Improvement Association, dividing into research, training, and promotion departments, all located in Jinan. The second zone experiment station will be responsible for promotion. The College of Agriculture's 300+ mu of fields will serve as the experiment station site. Therefore, the location of the first zone experiment station has also been changed to Licheng (i.e., Jinan). Recently, the Department of Construction has completed the general regulations for the organization of the regional experiment stations and the budget for various expenses, which will take effect on September 1st. Department of Construction Director Zhang Honglie presented the organizational regulations and budget for the experiment stations at the provincial government's political affairs meeting today (the 17th). After discussion, it has been passed. The regulations and budget are as follows:</p>
<p>Organizational Regulations: Article 1: In order to increase the efficiency of agricultural trials and agricultural promotion, the Shandong Provincial Department of Construction will temporarily discontinue the county experiment stations and establish regional experiment stations in zones throughout the province. Article 2: Each regional experiment station will be supervised by the Department of Construction and will manage agricultural trials and agricultural surveys and promotion within its zone. The zone divisions are as follows: Zone 1: Licheng, Pingyuan, Linqing, Tangyi, Yanggu, Feicheng, Guan County, Changqing, En County, Qingping, Guan County, Shouzhang, Pingyin, Fan County, Tai'an, Gaotang, Boping, Guantao, Jucheng, Dong'a, Zhangqiu, Xiajin, Renping, Qiu County, Pu County, Ningyang, Qihe, Chengwu, Liaocheng, Xin County, Qufu, Ziyang. Zone 2: Huimin, Linyi, Wudi, Qingcheng, Boxing, Jiyang, Shanghe, Zhanhua, Qidong, Guangrao, Wancheng, Deping, Bin County, Changshan, Linzi, Dezhou, Leling, Putai, Huantai, Ling County, Yangxin, Lijin, Gaoyuan. Zone 3: Ju County, Zou County, Laiwu, Changle, Jiaozhou, Linyi, Sishui, Fushan, Yishui, Rizhao, Tancheng, Fei County, Zichuan, Nuo County, Yi County, Mengyin, Yidu, Anqiu, Teng County, Xintai, Linqu, Gaomi. Zone 4: Laiyang, Pingdu, Qixia, Rongcheng, Jimo, Yexian, Fushan, Haiyang, Zhili County, Zhaoyuan, Muping, Changyi, Huang County, Wendeng, Shouguang, Penglai. Article 3: The first zone experiment station is located in Licheng, the second zone experiment station is located in Huimin, the third zone experiment station is located in Ju County, and the fourth zone experiment station is located in Laiyang. Article 4: The expenses of each regional experiment station will be temporarily funded by consolidating the original funds of the county experiment stations and allocating them by the Department of Construction. After provincial funds are determined and included in the provincial budget, the county funds will still be used by the respective counties for construction and industrial development. Article 5: Each regional experiment station will have one station director, appointed by the Department of Construction from graduates of agricultural colleges with at least two years of agricultural administration experience, or from graduates of agricultural vocational schools with at least three years of agricultural administration or crop trial experience. They will be responsible for all matters of the entire station. Article 6: Each regional experiment station will have one to two technicians, selected by the Department of Construction from graduates of agricultural colleges with at least two years of crop trial experience, or from graduates of agricultural vocational schools with at least two years of crop trial experience. They will be appointed by the director to manage all technical matters. The technicians in the fourth experiment station should be limited to those who specialize in horticulture. Article 7: Each regional experiment station will have one to three assistant technicians, selected by the director from graduates of agricultural colleges or agricultural vocational schools with at least three years of agricultural experience. They will be reported to the Department of Construction for appointment and will be directed by the director to assist in all technical matters.

<p>The Central Trust Bureau is scheduled to officially begin operations today, handling various trust businesses. Chairman Kong of the Bureau has submitted the opening situation to the Executive Yuan of the National Government for record, and has telegraphed various ministries, commissions, and provincial and municipal governments for notification, instructing their respective subordinate agencies that, in the future, for various businesses that should be handled by the Bureau, all agencies should contact and handle them in accordance with the regulations. This morning at 9:00 AM, the Bureau held its opening ceremony. The ceremony was grand. Chairman Kong and Director Zhang both personally attended the meeting. All directors and supervisors were present. The board of directors and supervisors held a joint meeting to discuss business policies. Since the Bureau began preparations, it has been over a year. Various internal procedures have been completed. Since the announcement was made in this city, people from all walks of life have flocked to the Bureau to inquire about business details, and those preparing to entrust business are endless. The establishment of the Central Trust Bureau and the Central Savings Association is due to the new criminal law, which stipulates that any private individuals who intend to operate prize-linked savings for profit or issue lottery tickets without government permission are prohibited. Therefore, the original savings associations had to stop operating. In order to protect the interests of depositors in the old savings associations, the government, after deliberation by the Central Political Conference, specially authorized the Central Trust Bureau to establish the Central Savings Association to manage prize-linked savings in order to transform private into public, encourage the public's savings concept, and it is also heard that the Association, since the government's issuance of lottery tickets is not prohibited in the new criminal law, has changed to drawing prizes monthly, and the treatment of depositors is improved compared with the original savings associations to benefit depositors. The regulations are being drafted. Once approved by the government, they will be announced. At that time, the prize-linked savings of the Sino-French Jia and Yi departments and the China Industrial Bank can be merged and handled, and the methods will also be announced at the same time.</p>

<p>The Japanese "Riyue Xinwen" (Sun and Moon News) reports that the scholars Song Lian and his disciple Fang Zhengxue, during the reign of Emperor Taizu of the Ming Dynasty, had the greatest influence on Japanese culture. Professor Tomita Kensuke of Kochi Prefectural High School has been entrusted by the Department of Cultural Affairs with China to study the relics of Ming Dynasty scholars. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday aboard the "Shanghai Maru". He made the following statement to reporters: "Song Lian was a Ming Dynasty scholar, also known as Jinglian. During the reign of Emperor Taizu of the Ming Dynasty, he formulated rituals and music systems, edited the History of the Yuan Dynasty, and was hailed as the literary master of his time. Envoys from foreign countries all heard of his name. When envoys from Japan, Goryeo, and Annam came to China, they all purchased his literary collections. The Complete Works of Song Xueshi consists of 333 volumes. His posthumous works were supplemented and compiled by later generations. Japanese translations are already available. His disciple Fang Zhengxue inherited his legacy and was also known for his literary talent, becoming famous for a generation. Their theories have greatly influenced Japanese culture. Chinese ancient culture is originally the crown of all nations, but it is regrettable that the Chinese people are fascinated by European and American culture to the detriment of their original culture. I admire Song Lian and Fang Zhengxue very much. Now, in order to collect relics, I have come to China to investigate. The investigation is scheduled to last for one month. I will visit various places and report the results to the Department of Cultural Affairs with China. I will first visit Song Lian's hometown of Jinhua, then Fang Zhengxue's hometown of Ninghai, and then Song's lost territory of Quzhou between Yichang and Chongqing. I will also explore the deeds of Su Dongpo, Tao Yuanming, Bai Letian, and Xu Junqi. Xu Junqi was imprisoned for twenty years and refused to submit to the Qing Dynasty, eventually dying for his integrity."</p>

<p>According to Dagong News Agency, the commercially operated Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, since taking over the former Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, has been in operation for over a decade. The business has flourished year by year, with more than 400 workers employed in the new and old plants combined. Recently, the factory management, in order to manage workers' work and increase efficiency, specially formulated seventy articles of worker service rules. Among them, the content of Articles 14, 23, 24, 49, and 52 placed many restrictions on workers. Therefore, all the workers reported to the Sixth District Water and Electricity Workers' Union, which, after careful study by the joint meeting of the union's directors and supervisors, deemed it necessary to have a detailed consideration with the factory. They requested a temporary suspension of implementation, which was not agreed to by the factory. Therefore, the union yesterday morning sent representatives Ding Kunshan, Gu Jinfa, Le Lianpin, and Zhao Binxing to petition the party and government agencies. Lu Jingshi, a member of the municipal party headquarters, received them and promised to forward the request to the Social Affairs Bureau to temporarily suspend implementation and instructed the workers to report the articles in the rules that caused difficulties for the workers to the party headquarters for review and handling. The Social Affairs Bureau, represented by Wang Gang of the Third Section, replied that if the workers felt the articles were inappropriate, they could submit a request for revision. The representatives considered the result of the petition satisfactory. At the same time, more than 20 representatives from various departments of the new and old plants, including Ding Alin and Zhang Heshang, visited Deputy Manager Weng Yousan. The manager indicated that he would consult with General Manager Lu Bohong and respond within three days, it is said.</p>

<p>The new Huahua Silk and Satin Company, newly established at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Yunnan Road, is rumored to be the grandest and most complete silk and satin store in Shanghai. Initially, due to the time required for decoration and arrangement, the opening was delayed. It has now been decided to officially appear on the bustling Nanjing Road at 8:00 AM today. On the one hand, due to the company's large scale, and on the other hand, because the company's owner, Mr. Wang Qisong, is a well-known figure in the business world and has extensive social connections, it has attracted much attention from people in society. The details of the scheduled opening are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Business Philosophy</p>
<p>According to the company's owner, Mr. Wang, silk and satin have always been necessities among representative materials. The amount of consumption is, of course, amazing, but those in the silk and satin industry have not been able to fully promote their responsibility to consumers, or are only competing in the same aspect. Up to now, the silk and satin industry has not made significant progress. Now, the Dong Silk and Satin Company is appearing on Nanjing Road with a new attitude, hoping that there will be an epoch-making change in the history of silk and satin. However, I, Benyuan, have a humble wish and limited strength. I ask for guidance from all parties and take the following creeds as the company's business philosophy: 1. Strive for high quality; 2. Strive for popular pricing; 3. Strive for sincere service.</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony Figures</p>
<p>The company is scheduled to hold its opening ceremony on time at 8:00 AM. In order to make the ceremony grand, the Eastern Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau has been specially invited to play music, and Mr. Mei Lanfang, Ms. Hu Die, and Ms. Yuan Meiyun, who have just returned from overseas, have been invited to unveil the plaque. It is expected to issue thousands of invitation cards. The streets will be crowded with cars and horses at that time, and there will be many Chinese and Western guests and numerous celebrities. In order to take care of the guests, Zheng Chengqing, Jin Runxiang, and other members of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce have been invited to serve as receptionists. To increase interest, a</p>
<p>Airplane Gift</p>
<p>has been specially created. A plane specially dispatched by China National Aviation Corporation will fly around the city from 10:00 AM to 1:30 PM today, distributing printed materials along the way. Anyone who picks up a printed material with the company's oblong (take this to the company to receive a gift within five days) rubber stamp or square private seal can receive a gift from the company within the time limit. Among the gifts are the company's silk and satin robe materials for men and women, as well as exquisite cosmetics from Maochang Optical, Zhongfa, Zhongxi, and the Family Industrial Society. Therefore, the gifts are extremely valuable and the distribution is very common. Furthermore, in order to create a grand opening for the company, which is feared to be unprecedented and unmatched by major stores in Shanghai, Huahua Film Company</p>
<p>Filmed it</p>
<p>and published a special issue in Shenbao, Xinwenbao, and Shanghai Shangbao. The internal stories are written with interesting text by many masters. The only concern is that the silk movement is quite common, and there are also silk sports.</p>
<p>Broadcasting Meeting</p>
<p>will be held at Hua radio station (frequency zero six zero, location 6th floor of the Great Shanghai Restaurant). There will be programs broadcast (see Shenbao Xin advertising for details). Therefore, the situation today is expected to be very lively, and it is expected that it will become the silk and satin industry center of Nanjing Road in the future.</p>

<p>The 19th Aviation Lottery ticket drawing has been scheduled for October 4th at Yiyuan. Sales for this period have been strong, unprecedented. Since the 13th and 14th drawings, the public has had a thorough understanding of the many opportunities to win prizes. It is heard that the lottery office, in order to make the drawing situation clear to the general public, has taken photos of various procedures and all the arrangements in the venue during the drawing, and compiled tens of thousands of small books. It is now starting to bind them and will send them to the port manager to distribute them widely in the coming days.

<p>Since the Ministry of Communications ordered the International Telecommunications Bureau to begin registering civilian broadcast radios on August 1st, the two-month deadline expired yesterday. A Datong News Agency reporter has recorded the following:</p>
<p>Deadline Expired</p>
<p>Since the International Telecommunications Bureau issued a notice ordering all broadcast radios, whether tube type, official type, or crystal type, to be registered with the bureau by the end of September, applications from citizens and foreigners who have radios have been very enthusiastic, with more than 68,000 registered. The bureau has reviewed the registration forms and submitted them to the Ministry of Communications for license issuance. Now that the deadline has expired, the bureau's engineering department will soon send inspectors to investigate. If any violations of Article 211 of the regulations are discovered, the households will be fined between five and one hundred yuan in accordance with the provisions of Article 211 of the Telecommunications Regulations.</p>
<p>Notice to Households</p>
<p>The bureau also issued a special notice to citizens to beware of imposters posing as radio inspectors. The original text is as follows: "According to confidential reports, there are currently people impersonating personnel from this bureau to privately inspect broadcast radios in the city, attempting to defraud. This bureau is currently not sending personnel to inspect. In the future, if inspection is necessary, the bureau will issue licenses to the inspectors as credentials and will also publish a notice in the newspaper. For fear that all circles will be deceived, this special notice is issued for general knowledge."</p>
<h3 id="e135">Municipal Public Security Bureau - Tea House Registration Deadline Expired Yesterday - More Than 560 Tea Houses Have Been Registered as Qualified - Licenses of More Than 400 Unqualified Tea Houses to Be Revoked <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Cai Jingjun, the director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, previously stated that Shanghai is a place where Chinese and foreigners live together, and idlers often use tea houses as places to rest. Those who set up tea houses often engage in illegal activities such as gambling and skimming profits, which has a significant impact on social security. Therefore, starting on the first day of last month, tea house registration was started. All tea houses in the urban area must fill out an application form to apply for registration. After the bureau receives the application form, it will send personnel to conduct an on-site investigation. Those who are deemed qualified will be issued a business license and allowed to register. Those who are slightly unqualified will be ordered to improve. Currently, more than 560 tea houses have applied for registration and have been deemed qualified, and more than 400 have been deemed unqualified. There are still many who have not applied for registration. It is learned that the registration has been set to expire yesterday (30th). Those who have not registered after the deadline or those who are unqualified will have their business licenses revoked by the bureau in conjunction with the Social Affairs Bureau, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e140">General Report of the Chinese Institute of Engineers (Continued) <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>(7) Regarding Honorary Gold Medals: Academic organizations in Europe and the United States often award honorary gold medals or medals to those who have made special contributions to construction, in order to encourage academic experts to focus on construction. In small terms, they seek improvements for the country and society, and in large terms, they create happiness for mankind. The articles are perfect, so their countries are becoming richer and stronger, and talents are emerging in large numbers, with all industries prospering. This is not only because they are good at encouragement, but also because they promote it. The association, in view of this, passed seven articles on the method of awarding honorary gold medals at the 14th board meeting. This year, after discussion by Mr. Gu Huichang and others, Mr. Hou Debang presided over the salt-making project of the Tianjin Water Conservancy Salt Industry Company for more than ten years and achieved great results. He also authored the book "Salt Industry," which made a special contribution to the engineering community. The association should give him an honorary gold medal. The board of directors then appointed five experts, Wu Yun Chu, Xu Shanxiang, Ding Sixian, Xu Jiadong, and Xu Mingcai, to review the matter. The review report stated that it met the standards of the association's honorary gold medal method. His book "Salt Industry" is admired by Western industrial experts, promotes specialized learning, and benefits mankind. Mr. Hou has made a special contribution to the engineering community and should be awarded the first honorary gold medal to recognize his labor. This was approved by the 17th board meeting and will be awarded at this year's annual meeting. (8) Regarding the Zhu Mu Scholarship: No one was selected for this fund last year. According to the third article of the solicitation method, the 100 yuan fund from last year should be transferred to this year, and the number of nominees for this year should be increased by one. At the same time, one person may be selected. This year, there were a total of nine essays solicited for the fund. The 18th board meeting decided to appoint Xu Mingcai, Zhang Tingjin, Li Qianruo, Qiu Weiyu, and Ma Deji as evaluation committee members. On July 26th, the evaluation committee members selected Lin Tongyan and Wu Huaqing, each receiving a fund of 100 yuan. (9) Regarding Awards for Annual Meeting Papers: In order to encourage interest in research in engineering, Mr. Shen Junyi drafted six articles on the method of awarding awards for annual meeting papers, which were revised and approved by the 14th board meeting and implemented from 1934. For the annual meeting papers of the previous year, the review committee members Zhou Xiyong, Liu Jinyu, and Xu Mingcai selected the first prize paper, "Hydraulic Conditions and Flow Calculation of Siphon Pipes" by Cao Ruizhi; the second prize paper, "A Brief History of the Design and Manufacture of Dredgers for Inland Rivers in Shandong" by Lu Zhishun; and the third prize paper, "Evolution of Porcelain Kilns" by Ling Qijun. According to the fourth article of the method, they were awarded prizes of 100 yuan for Cao Ruizhi, 50 yuan for Lu Zhishun, and 30 yuan for Ling Qijun. (10) Regarding the Report of the Sichuan Inspection Group: In April of last year, members of the Sichuan Inspection Group entered Sichuan and conducted inspections in groups for two months. The group was divided into eighteen groups, and each group compiled a report based on their findings and had it printed. The following fifteen groups have been published: Cement, Water Conservancy, Electricity, Telecommunications, Railways, Steel, Copper Mines, Coal Mines, Geology, Incinerated Iron, Paint, Petroleum, Fire Wells, Sugar Industry, Highway. The other two groups, Supervision and Pharmaceuticals, will also be published soon. The Textile Group is currently being compiled, and once all the group reports are complete, they can be compiled into a volume.</p>

<h3 id="e142">Dafuli, Morphine Factory Case; Police Request Adjournment for Further Questioning; Defendants' Statements All Shift Blame <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Jin Jiulin, inspector of the French police, Zhang Qianying, detective, and others, cracked down on a private morphine factory at No. 7 Dafuli, Maich Road, the day before yesterday. They arrested five people, including Cai Asheng, Gu Jiahao (mistakenly written as A Quan yesterday), Cai Henian, Zhou Xinlai, and Liu Zhiming, bosses and employees, and confiscated morphine, raw materials, machinery, and other items. They were taken to the police station for investigation. The situation has been reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday, the police sent the five defendants, including Cai, to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District. Judge Wang Gangxu questioned them. Yao Zhaodi, a lawyer from the Police Department, stated the case, saying that the defendants were arrested for jointly manufacturing opium substitutes and requested an adjournment of two weeks for investigation before filing for interrogation. Then, Detective Zhang Ziying reported the process of solving the case, saying that after obtaining clues, he went to arrest them at 1:30 PM yesterday afternoon. The front and back doors of the factory were tightly closed. Fearing that the defendants would be alarmed and escape, he guarded the front and back doors. Then he climbed in from the drying platform of No. 6 and saw Gu Jiahao and Zhou Xinlai working upstairs, Cai Asheng downstairs, and Cai Henian working in the pavilion. He told them not to move and then went downstairs to open the door and let the detectives in to arrest them. After searching each defendant, he went to No. 3 Sanyu on Lafayette Road based on their confessions and arrested Liu Zhiming. He also presented the confiscated evidence and said that according to the defendants' confessions, Wang Yonghe, who lived at No. 5 Yongyu Li, jointly opened the factory. When he went to arrest Wang, Wang had already escaped. Cai Asheng (36 years old, from Hedong, living at No. 7 Dafuli, Maiqi Road) confessed that Wang Yonghe had gathered me to rent this house for a month. I paid 60 yuan. Wang's capital has not yet been raised. He comes once a day, mixes the ingredients, but hasn't started making anything. I don't know what he is doing. Gu Ahao (34 years old, from Ningbo, living at the same address) confessed that Wang Yonghe brought him in to cook and be a steward. He only worked for three or four days. Cai Henian (33 years old, from Shanghai, living at the same address) confessed that he is from the same clan as Cai Asheng. Because he had nothing to do, he lived at Asheng's place. Asheng scolded him to go upstairs to help with odd jobs. Wang Yonghe said he was making Ajinomoto and promised him 10 yuan a month, but only paid him 5 yuan. Zhou Xinlai (36 years old, from Ningbo, living at No. 12 Yuqing Gongfang, Bayer Road) confessed that Cai Asheng asked him to be a partner, saying he was making Ajinomoto, and the salary was not set. He would share the dividends in the future after making money. Liu Zhiming (35 years old, from Ningbo, living at No. 7 Sanyu Li, Lafayette Road) confessed that he had no shares and was friends with Wang Yonghe. He met Wang on the road yesterday, and Wang gave him two bottles of medicine and asked him to temporarily keep them at his home. Wang left immediately, and he did not know what the medicine was for. The court verified the confessions and decided to postpone the hearing to the morning of October 15th. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Child Custody Case; Doctor to Appraise; Zhang Tiaomei and Lin Xie's Confessions Each Hold Their Ground; The Son in Dispute Surrendered Yesterday to Describe Everything <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Tiaomei, the Chinese manager of Yufeng Foreign Company on Jiangxi Road, previously hired lawyer Ling Qihong to accuse the woman Li Chuanhong of illegally occupying his adopted son Yixian and disrupting the family in the First Special Court. The Special Court has summoned them twice, but the defendant has not appeared. A new hearing date was set. The situation has been reported in this newspaper. At 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon, the date for the continued hearing of this case arrived. Because Zhang's accused is Lin Baoyi's wife, Lin's wife Xie had to surrender to respond to the lawsuit. First, lawyers Di Bingjian and Zhang Tong filed a complaint, stating that Lin Xie's original home was in Nanjing. At the age of 18, she was arranged by her parents to meet Lin Baoyi (former naval commander), and they began living together. At that time, Lin Baoyi was working for the Tongji Training Fleet, and the original wife, Li, was still alive. They lived together for ten years, and after Li's death, the wedding was held. They then moved to Shanghai, where she met the plaintiff's sister-in-law, Mrs. Wang, and they became sisters beyond blood. Zhang Tiaomei, the plaintiff, had no occupation, so they rarely interacted. Whenever her sister-in-law saw the defendant, she repeatedly borrowed money. After her sister-in-law died in 1931, she repeatedly came to borrow money. The defendant repeatedly told her servants to sternly refuse, avoiding a grudge. She did not hesitate to think hard and fabricate accusations as a basis for extortion. Moreover, Lin Jisen, the defendant's son, named Zhao Cong, has neither the name Yixian nor Jisheng. He is indeed the biological son of her husband, Lin Baoyi. In 1917, her husband advocated protecting the constitution and went to Guangdong to serve as naval commander. To prevent arrest by the Beijing government, the whole family moved to Guangdong. At that time, Jisen was only two years old, and there are photos from the time in Guangdong to prove it. After the affair was over, the family returned to Shanghai. Jisen attended the Chinese and Western Girls' School and St. John's Youth Middle School, and there are diplomas and school registers to prove it. The defendant's daughter, named Wan, married Zhu Yuan of Baoshan. There are definite facts to prove this. It is definitely not something the plaintiff can force with empty words. Therefore, in addition to requesting the dismissal of the self-lawsuit and declaring the defendant innocent, the plaintiff should be punished for false accusations and public defamation under Articles 169 and 310 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday afternoon, Lin Xie surrendered through a lawyer. She claimed to be from Nanjing, 56 years old, and living at No. 74 Tongfu Road. At the age of 18, she married Lin Baoyi as a concubine. At the age of 25, Lin's first wife died. At the age of 28, he made me his legitimate wife. I had one son and one daughter. The son's name is Zhao Cong, nicknamed Jisen, now 20 years old. The daughter's name is Wanjun, now 38 years old. At the age of 28, she married Zhu Yuan as his second wife and had two daughters and one son. The son died, and the two daughters are now ten and four years old and are both healthy. I did not know the plaintiff. Because I and her sister-in-law, Zhang Wang, became sworn sisters and had a very close relationship, we often visited each other, so I met the plaintiff. At that time, the plaintiff repeatedly borrowed money. Her sister-in-law cried to me, and I mediated, inevitably causing a grudge with the plaintiff, so she fabricated false accusations. Then, the plaintiff Zhang Tiaomei claimed that the person she was accusing was the defendant who had appeared in court. She accused her of illegally occupying her adopted son and requested permission to take him back. Then, Lin Zhaocong claimed to be 20 years old, nicknamed Jisen, and that he was the defendant's biological son. He also stated that he had attended school over the years and that Lin Jisen had appeared in court. The plaintiff Tiaomei then claimed that this child was her adopted son and could call witnesses to testify. The defendant Lin Xie insisted that Jisen was her biological son and requested a medical examination. Judge Wu Zehan verified the confessions and decided to postpone the hearing to the afternoon of October 12th, pending a medical examination.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Film Actress's Husband Is an Expert Pickpocket; Able to Steal Eight Wallets in One Minute; Sentenced to One Year Imprisonment After Arrest <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Ji Jinsheng from Suzhou, nicknamed "Pijing Xiao A Mao" (Naughty Little Mao), made a living by pickpocketing. His technique was very sophisticated, and he could steal as many as eight wallets in one minute. Therefore, general thieves regarded him as their leader. Ji's wife, Cheng Wenjun (also known as Wang Wenjun, from Nanjing, a film actress for the Diantong Film Company), lived with him at No. 29 Maho Road. Ji had been arrested and sentenced by the court more than seven times and was released from prison on March 4th of this year. Ji did not repent and continued his career without capital. On the 22nd of this month, Ji used his old tricks again at a tram stop at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road, stealing a wallet from Huang Zesheng, director of the insurance department of Sincere Company. While passing the entrance of the Hentley Watch Company on Nanjing Road, he was spotted by Chinese detectives Wang Jiaju and Pang Yutang of the Old Gate Police Station. They went forward to arrest him, and Ji threw the wallet on the ground and tried to escape. The detectives caught the thief and took him back to the police station. Ji then confessed that on the 19th of this month, at the same location, he stole a wallet from Chai Jiangshan, containing 35 yuan and 7 jiao. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide of the First Criminal Court of the Special District interrogated him. The police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated the case, prosecuting him for repeated theft under Article 321, paragraph 4 of the Criminal Law, and claimed that the defendant had confessed at the police station that on September 11th, his wife, Cheng Wenjun, introduced him to Diantong Company as an actor to film in Hangzhou, and that he returned to Shanghai on the 17th. He met several accomplices at the Maurice Market and discussed theft in room 347 of the Oriental Hotel on Xizang Road. His confession was completely consistent with the facts and should be severely punished. Ji tried to deny everything, saying he was being framed. After Judge Feng's questioning, Ji Jinsheng was sentenced to one year imprisonment for repeated theft.</p>

<p>The fundraising for flood relief in various provinces is proceeding with various entertainment events and is extremely busy. National martial arts performances for flood relief, and inviting famous actors Mei Lanfang and Shanghai amateur performers to perform for flood relief have already begun or are about to begin. The details of each situation are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Martial Arts Performances for Flood Relief</p>
<p>The martial arts performances for flood relief were initiated by Mr. Yang Guangxing of the Continental Daily and co-organized with the fundraising group of the charity association.

<p>Drama Performances for Flood Relief Begin</p>
<p>The invitation of famous actors Mei Lanfang and Shanghai amateur performers to help with fundraising was separately negotiated by Mr. Du Yuesheng and others and has been properly arranged. It has been decided to perform at the Golden Theater to help with fundraising. The performance period is initially set for one month, and all the proceeds from ticket sales will be used for flood relief. The performances will begin tomorrow (2nd) night. In addition to Mei Lanfang, those invited and those who voluntarily participate include Zhang Xiaolin, Madam Du, Wang Xiaolai, Zhang Weiru, Jin Yuansheng, Zhang Yaoquan, Guo Xiaoxiao, Fang Cenyi, You Jusun, Zhu Rushan, Zhao Peixin, Qiu Jianfei, Shao Jingfu, Li Baishui, Zhu Lianfu, Zhu Guifang, Jiang Miaoxiang, Sun Lanting, Yuan Senqi, Jin Shaoshan, Qian Zhixiang, Hong Yanbin, Yu Yungu, Xiao Changhua, Liu Lianrong, and dozens of others.

<p>Holding Disaster Relief Sports</p>
<p>The fundraising group of the Charity Relief Association also plans, after this National Games, to request all participating athletes to hold a disaster relief sports meeting to show their compassion for the millions of flood victims in the Yangtze, Yellow, and Pearl River basins. All ticket revenue will be used for disaster relief. Li Dachao, deputy director of the fundraising group, believes that the holding of the disaster relief sports event will definitely be successful. Among them, the football match and swimming competition will be especially popular with the audience.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Confirmed by Maritime Surveillance Map: Old Kangwang City Exists Northwest of Jinshan; Wei Juxian Makes New Discoveries from Ancient Texts; This Matter Attracts Attention from Central and Local Authorities <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Following the discovery of the "Old Kangwang City" in Jinshan, archaeologist Mr. Wei Juxian has conducted detailed research using the book "Maritime Surveillance Map," confirming its consistency with legends. A reporter from this newspaper visited Mr. Wei yesterday to inquire about the details. According to him, the pottery discovered in Jinshan previously is related to the stone tools he found at Qixia Mountain and the descendants of Shao Kang of the Yue kingdom. He once personally visited the discovery site for investigation, recognizing that the pottery fragments were washed up by seawater from the beach. The section affected by the seawater extends for several miles. They are not items found on private land, and permission should be formally requested before excavation. Local sources also state that there are many such pottery fragments in Jinshan (not Jinshanwei). Legend has it that there is an ancient city under the mountain, visible when the water is shallow. Later, he consulted the "Maritime Surveillance Map," which depicts Jinshan connected to the mainland, with the Old Kangwang City located northwest of Jinshan, confirming these claims and aligning with local legends. Regarding the value of the Jinshan relics and their relationship with Shanghai, Jinshan is a hundred miles from Shanghai. Several similar pieces have been found west of Fanwang Ferry and in Zhenru, exhibiting identical patterns. This indicates that ancient Shanghai culture is not as recent as generally speculated. He also stated that the discovery of the "Old Kangwang City" in Jinshan is of significant value due to its deep historical and cultural connections with the South. Currently, the central antiquities preservation authorities and local officials in Jinshan County are paying special attention to this matter, ensuring that no private individuals monopolize or secretly excavate the site. Archaeological experts will be dispatched to conduct systematic investigation and excavation work.</p>

<h3 id="e148">Murder of Wife in Great World Case: Appeal Rejected <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Zhao Jishan, 32 years old, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner from Zhenjiang residing at No. 71, Xinkangli, Kang Nao Tuo Road, Public Concession, and practicing at Guangyi Hospital on Roberts Road, favored his concubine Zhong Zhen's brother and disliked his wife Zhao Leng (34 years old). On the afternoon of July 3rd this year, he lured Leng to the rooftop platform of the four-story building of the amusement park. Near the railing along the corridor on the side of Ai Duo Ya Road facing the Gong Wu Stage, he picked her up, intending to throw her down to kill her. Fortunately, in the critical moment, she clung to the railing and cried for help. The tea server Zhu Jinfu from Suzhou rushed to rescue her and sent her husband to the accounting office. Zhao was arrested and sent to the police station, and the Public Security Bureau prosecuted him for attempted murder in the Special No. 2 Court. Judge Li Changnian conducted repeated trials and ultimately sentenced Zhao Jishan to five years of imprisonment for attempted murder. Zhao, dissatisfied with the verdict, filed an appeal with the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, presenting cunning arguments to evade responsibility. These details have been reported in this newspaper. The High Court's Third Branch conducted repeated trials and concluded that the appellant Zhao Jishan did indeed attempt to harm his wife and could not evade responsibility. The debate was declared closed, and yesterday morning, Sun Honglin, the acting presiding judge of the Third Branch, ordered Zhao Jishan to appear in the Third Criminal Court and announced the rejection of the appeal.

<p>Shen Zufu, who served as the manager of the Yong'an Silver Company for one day after its reopening, and Dai Kechang, who served as the manager of the Xiafei Road branch of the company for nine days, were jointly accused of embezzlement and fraud by dozens of depositors in the First Special District Court, along with several directors of the company. Initially, they all failed to appear in court. Recently, due to the court's strict enforcement, knowing that avoidance was futile, they complied and surrendered. Judge Xiao concluded the investigation and ordered Shen to post a 3,000 yuan bond and Dai to await a reviewed judgment, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon was the date for the verdict. Neither Shen nor Dai reported to the court. Judge Xiao then opened the court and announced the verdict: Shen Zufu and Dai Kechang were both found not guilty. Deng Jinghuan and the other thirteen people whose whereabouts are unknown have had their trials suspended. The company collapsed again, and creditors sued its directors and general managers to recover their debts. Over half a year has passed, but the court has been unable to proceed with the entire case because most of the defendants have avoided appearing in court. Therefore, the court has adopted a method of trying each defendant separately, judging the part of the case related to each defendant who appears in court so that those who appear in court are not delayed by those who refuse to appear. Yesterday was the third verdict. The first person acquitted was Luo Huafang. The second verdict found Lin Kanghou and Ou Jiancheng guilty. Now only Deng Jinghuan and the other thirteen remain, and their appearance in court is unlikely.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Fang Aying Sues Zhang Wubo: Confirmation of Parentage Case; Reconciliation Attempt Failed; Trial Concluded Yesterday, Awaiting Judgment <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Wubo, nearly fifty years old, who works at Yongtaichang Store in Taihefang, Fuzhou Road, seduced Fang Aying, a young woman from Dinghai, and rented a house to live together, eventually having a son named Zhimin. While Zhimin was still in swaddling clothes, Zhang suddenly had the idea of abandoning them, falsely claiming that he was going to Japan for business. He disappeared without a trace. Aying endured hardship to raise her son. Until two years ago, she accidentally encountered Zhang on the street. Thinking he had returned from abroad, she told her then eight-year-old son to call him "Grandpa." Unexpectedly, Zhang not only treated his son as a stranger but also glared at Aying as if he did not know her and walked away. Aying realized she had been abandoned. She thought that her relationship with Zhang was illegitimate and difficult to argue. However, she believed that Zhang, as the father of Zhimin, should be responsible for his upbringing. Therefore, in her capacity as the legal guardian of Zhimin, she filed a lawsuit against him, seeking confirmation of parentage. However, she lost in both the first and second trials. Unwilling to give up, she hired lawyer Chen Zhen to appeal to the Supreme Court, which overturned the previous judgments and sent the case back to the Second Branch of the High Court for retrial. These details have been reported previously. Now, the Second Branch of the High Court has, based on the Supreme Court's instructions, repeatedly opened trials, summoned witnesses, conducted thorough investigations, and sent Zhang Wubo and his young son Zhang Zhimin to the Zhenru Forensic Institute to test their blood for reference. Fang Aying had previously testified in court that Zhang Wubo had contracted syphilis. This kind of hidden illness cannot be known unless one shares the same bed. The examination by the institute also confirmed that Zhang had indeed contracted this type of venereal disease. Yesterday afternoon, Chief Judge Li of the Second Branch of the High Court continued the collegiate panel trial, summoning both parties for further questioning. Lawyer Chen Zhen, representing the appellant, stated that the appellee had attempted reconciliation, offering the appellant 300 yuan for living expenses, but the appellant refused because the amount was too small. Reconciliation failed. If Zhang had not cohabited with Fang and had a child, why would he be willing to make such a sacrifice? This is sufficient to prove their past relationship. Zhang also hired lawyer Xiong to defend him. After the arguments from both sides were concluded, the court adjourned and announced that the verdict would be delivered at a later date.</p>

<p>The Capital National Goods Exhibition Hall of the Ministry of Industry planned to hold its sixth-anniversary celebration on October 10th. Mr. Peng Boxun, the director of the hall, came to Shanghai to solicit manufacturers to participate in the exhibition. Due to economic reasons, the temporary market has been suspended. The Federation of National Goods Factories yesterday notified the factories, stating, "We have received a letter from Director Peng of the National Goods Exhibition Hall of the Ministry of Industry, stating that the opening of the sixth-anniversary celebration is approaching, and it is unknown how many long-term vendors have been recruited. Currently, there are only ten remaining stalls in the market. If the long-term registration has filled this number, please notify the vendors to come to Beijing to install counters and lighting as soon as possible to avoid rushing at the last minute. For temporary vendors, please declare on their behalf that they are also operating within the market and can only accommodate ten vendors. Upon approval, we previously entrusted Director Peng to solicit manufacturers for both permanent and temporary stalls. Now, according to the letter, the temporary market is limited to ten vendors, presumably canceling the temporary operation. We have scheduled a meeting for all registered vendors at 2:00 PM on September 30th to discuss and decide whether to participate permanently, and we will reply accordingly. If you do not participate, the market fees and advertising fees already paid will be refunded as per the receipts." After discussion, the vendors decided yesterday (1) to suspend participation in the exhibition and (2) to refund the registration fees already paid as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Since the Abyssinian issue arose, the world has been uneasy, and the Chinese people, who are concerned about national affairs and current events, have been even more perplexed. They wondered if the Italian-Abyssinian war would break out and, if so, what impact it would have on China, given that European countries would have no time to attend to the East. Fortunately, the current issue of Guoxun (No. 108) provides an exceptionally clear answer to these two questions. The articles "What Will Happen to Us If Italy and Abyssinia Go to War?" and "Where Do Small Nations Go? Where Does Imperialism Go?" are carefully structured by two international commentary experts. Those who care about current events should not miss them. Other articles such as "Economic Investigation Group to Japan and National Diplomacy," "Revitalizing Water Conservancy and People's Service in Military Construction," "Shanghai Finance Under External Pressure," "Talking About Consumption," "The Issue of Popular Sentiment in the Southern War," and "Outdated Words" are all of great value.

In general, the entire article is inconsistent with the facts. I used to work at the Weizhilu Ballroom and occasionally knew Ren Aina, but there has never been any relationship between us.

<p>Wang Fan Arrested, No Sentence Yet, Special Trial Scheduled, Five Suspects Investigated and Found Not Guilty, Released</p>
<p>Following the robbery at the North Sichuan Road Postal Administration Bureau, seven men and women from Jiangbei were arrested by the Dixwell Road Police Station on the 21st of this month and sent to the First Special District Court for temporary detention. The Municipal Public Security Bureau subsequently apprehended Liu Desheng from Shandong and a Jiangbei woman, Wu Fan, at No. 38 Qingyun Road and No. 49 London Road in Zhabei. They were sent to the Shanghai District Court for detention. For investigative purposes, the police station sent an official letter to the First Special District Court to retrieve Liu and Wu to the Third Tribunal, requesting a 30-day extension for a joint trial. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi came to the court for interrogation. Li Zhishan, the lawyer of the Public Works Department, stated that the police station had completed the investigation of Liu Desheng and requested that he be sent back to the Shanghai District Court. The trial of Wang Fan was postponed for a special hearing and she was returned to custody. The court approved the request and adjourned the joint trial to October 8th. It is reported that the police station recently apprehended another important criminal in Jiangbei, who will be brought to Shanghai soon.

<p>The Hong Kong male and female swimming athletes, including the mermaid Yang Xiuqiong, participating in this National Games, a group of thirteen people led by Yang's father, Zhu Nan, arrived in Shanghai on the President Jefferson at 12:00 noon yesterday. The ship docked at buoys 12 and 13 in Yangshupu at 2:00 PM. Yang and his party disembarked at the new customs wharf. The welcomers were very crowded, reaching more than a thousand people. They then took cars to the New Asia Hotel to rest. Yang and others are scheduled to perform at the Municipal Government's new pool tonight.</p>
<p>Grand Arrival in Shanghai</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the Hong Kong National Games male and female swimming athletes who arrived included team leader and consultant Yang Zhunan, manager Yang Long Huiming, female team leader Yang Xiuqiong, team members Yang Xiuzhen, Qu Enzhao, Sha Huiying, Chen Fengqing, male team leader Chen Zhenxing, Li Luomin, team members Fang Zongyu, Zeng Hefu, Huang Xihan, and Chen Qiqian, a total of thirteen people. Chen Yuhui, because he is participating in the South China swimming competition, and coach Huang Yihe and team members Chen Fuxing and Chen Zhennan will depart from Hong Kong on the 2nd and arrive in Shanghai on the 5th. Liu Baoxi will depart on the 12th due to work reasons. Those who welcomed them at the port yesterday included Director Jian Jinglun, the representative of Mayor Wu, Jian Qingman, the owner of Nanyang Company, and Jian Erming, the coach of the Shanghai team, Liang Weisheng, the captain of the West YMCA team, Hengbo, Hong Kong team leader Ye Guanxian, manager Chen Ziqing, and Cantonese expatriates in Shanghai, totaling 5,000 people. They presented flowers to　, and the audience swarmed forward, surrounding Yang and his party. They then boarded cars and drove directly to the New Asia Hotel to rest.</p>
<p>Xiuqiong's Speech</p>
<p>Yang, tired from the long journey, only met with reporters after resting. Yang does not speak Mandarin, so Director Jian Jinglun of the Municipal Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau translated for her, answering questions from reporters. The main points are summarized as follows: (1) Regarding the issue of her marriage, she is still in school and it is too early to talk about it. The reports in the newspapers are all jokes made by friends. (2) Her swimming achievements have been　recorded in various newspapers and are difficult to recall at present, so she cannot answer them one by one. (3) The rumor that she will give up swimming in the future is also a misrepresentation. She is currently actively training to seek further development. (4) She is currently studying in the second year of high school at St. Paul's College in Hong Kong and has asked for leave to come to Shanghai. (5) Mayor Wu previously telegraphed travel expenses, instructing her to come to Shanghai to participate in the open competition held on the 22nd. His kindness is appreciated, but she had already replied by telegram and could not fulfill the request due to team actions, disappointing the mayor. She then went to the seventh-floor garden at the request of newspaper reporters to take photos.</p>
<p>Thoughts on This Trip</p>
<p>Yang expressed her feelings yesterday, which are as follows: "The National Games that I have been hoping for for a long time has arrived. When I saw the towering building of the Municipal Government on the Huangpu River, my heart started to beat faster. This time I have also met many athletes from all over the country and we are exchanging skills. I feel that the National Games is the driving force behind national sports. I started practicing in October last year to prepare for this National Games, but there has been no special progress. This is very disappointing to those who expect us. I hope that I can continue to train and seek deeper achievements. I am very grateful to those who guide and comment on me. Many people advise me to give up, saying that a person must leave at a certain time to avoid being defeated by others. As far as my personal opinion is concerned, if others can defeat me, that is the progress of the entire swimming world, and I am very much looking forward to the discovery of this phenomenon. When Japan first participated in the World Games, they did not understand the freestyle method and only knew the sidestroke. However, in 1924, they had relay swimming participation, and in 1928, excellent results such as those of Takaishi and Irie appeared. In 1932, they won the world swimming championship.</p>
<p>It can be seen that Japan's swimming progress in twelve years is rapid, and their progress is a mirror for the world stage. If our country can send athletes to participate in the World Games, it will benefit a lot. The National Games is a matter of pride for the people of our country, because there is no country in the world that has such a large-scale event. The National Games in the United States is also a gathering of the East, West, and Central United States. This National Games is held in Shanghai, making foreigners more aware that our country is becoming more united.</p>
<p>Jian's Banquet</p>
<p>All the male and female team members departed from the New Asia at 4:00 PM to try out the pool in the Municipal Pool for practice. At 7:00 PM, they attended a banquet hosted by Jian Jinglun, Director of the Municipal Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, at the Rain Garden in Tingwan. Those invited to accompany them were Li Dachao, Jian Qingman, Ye Yaotian, Hu Guigeng (representative of Hu Wenhu), Chen Ziqing, Lao Jingxiu, and Yang Zhunan and his wife, more than ten people in total. They dispersed at around 9:00 PM. Yang's younger brother, Changhua, did not come with them yesterday. According to Yang Xiuzhen, her friend said that Changhua is still in Peizheng Primary School and feared that he would miss his studies, so he did not come with them. Chen Yuhui could not make it due to work and will depart on the 2nd. We are very interested in swimming, so we are practicing every day, etc. Yang and others are scheduled to participate in the first Hong Kong-Shanghai埠 Inter-city Competition at the Municipal Pool at 8:00 PM tonight.</p>

<h3 id="e175">Guangxi Male and Female Athletes Also Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday and Registered, A Group of Eighteen People Led by Lu Qihua, One Person in Track and Field, the Rest All Participating in Swimming <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>The male and female swimming and track and field athletes from Guangxi participating in the National Games, a group of eighteen people led by team leader Lu Qihua, also arrived on the President Jefferson with Yang Xiuqiong and others yesterday afternoon. The male athletes all wore light gray homespun Western suits, military caps, and a name tag on their chests. The female athletes wore light gray homespun reverse-collar tops and light gray homespun skirts, also with a name tag on their chests. After landing, they rested briefly in formation, with a large flag presented by the Chairman of Guangxi, Huang Xuchu, at the front, with the words "Guangxi" written on it. They were neat, clean, simple, and unadorned. At the time, they took three special cars prepared by the National Games Organizing Committee directly to the Municipal Stadium dormitory in the central district to rest. The swimming athletes also practiced in the Municipal Swimming Pool for a long time.</p>
<p>Full Team List</p>
<p>(Team Leader) Lu Qihua, (Deputy Team Leader) Wei Zantang, (Manager) Yang Yin, (Track and Field) Huang Ruiwen, (Swimming) Men's Team: Su Fangneng, Liang Xianming, Chen Chuanming, Pang Yonglin, Lei Bingchang, Liu Kun, Huang Jinghuan, Women's Team: Wei Shaosheng, Huang Meili, Xu Zhenwan, Li Xiachao, Deng Haizhen, Pang Shuifang, Chen Xixian.</p>
<p>Guangxi Team Leader Talks</p>
<p>Lu Qihua, the team leader of the Guangxi team, talked to a 　 reporter, saying that the delegation departed from Nanning on the 20th of this month, arrived in Hong Kong on the 25th, stayed in Hong Kong for three days, and departed from Hong Kong for Shanghai on the 28th. In previous National Games, Guangxi did not participate due to its location in the border region and inconvenient travel. This is the first time they have participated in the 6th National Games. There are not many athletes and the strength is very weak, but the purpose of participation is not to win championships and compete for victory, but to learn and observe in this grand event and use it as a help from other mountains. Furthermore, the National Games should be participated in by all provinces and cities to share in the grand event. The reason why Guangxi traveled so far this time is also to express the spirit of cooperation and unity.</p>
<p>First to Register</p>
<p>After landing, the Guangxi athletes took a special vehicle straight to the stadium in the central district to register with the organizing committee, making them the first unit to register for this session. Moreover, Guangxi had never participated in the previous sessions, and this time they did not hesitate to travel, which is worth commemorating. The team members were all in high spirits. Except for Huang Ruiwen, who participated in the 1,500-meter and 10,000-meter track and field events (Huang's results are close to the National Games record of the previous session), the remaining athletes all participated in swimming, and their results are comparable to those of Guangdong and Hong Kong. According to the province, all the athletes participating in the National Games this time, except for one track and field athlete, are swimmers. In the Nanning Water Sports Games last month, they achieved excellent results in the 400-meter and 1,500-meter events.</p>

<p>The Shanghai-Hong Kong 　tennis match was held for the third day yesterday, with one group each for the men's second singles and the women's second doubles. Li Huitang won first and then lost. Korasha fought fiercely for five sets before winning. Shanghai then won all against Hong Kong with a score of five to zero. Yesterday, in the women's doubles, Shanghai won two to zero. The performance was not exciting at all. There are still two groups of women's singles today after the morning. Based on the situation, the Shanghai team has a strong chance of winning the women's championship. The details of yesterday's match are as follows:</p>
<p>Li Huitang Loses to Korasha</p>
<p>There were few spectators yesterday. The men's first singles match started at one o'clock. De Fu did not appear and was replaced by Korasha. Li and Korasha's ball skills were　matched, and they were evenly matched. Li Huitang's serve was sharp and his volley was also skillful, but his baseline long shots were not as good as Korasha's. In the first set, Li often used his wit and often used net cuts, making it impossible for Korasha to follow. He took the lead with a score of six to four. In the second set, Li first won one game and then lost four games in a row, making the score four to one, with Korasha taking the lead. Then Li repeatedly seized opportunities to score, winning five games in a row, and ended the second set with a score of six to four. It was expected that he would take the opportunity to defeat Korasha, but in the third set, Li missed many opportunities and was defeated by Korasha with scores of six to two, six to three, and six to three in a row, ending the match with a score of three to two. Korasha won with fierce baseline long shots in the last three sets.</p>
<p>Women's Doubles Performance is Average</p>
<p>In the women's second doubles, Ms. Ge Lifei of the Hong Kong team had average ball skills, and Mrs. Zhao Zhengzhao was also quite weak, while Mrs. Korasha of the Shanghai team not only had sharp serves, but also had commendable long shots and volley nets. Mrs. Tuile did her best, so the strength of the two sides was uneven, forming a one-sided situation. In the first set, Shanghai first scored two games, and after Hong Kong won back the third game, they immediately lost four games in a row. Shanghai took the lead with a score of six to one. In the second set, the Hong Kong team softened all the way, losing more than they gained, and Shanghai won six games in a row, ending the match with a score of two to zero.</p>
<p>Last Two Singles Today</p>
<p>The Shanghai women's team has already taken a two-to-one lead. There are still two groups of the second and first singles today. If Shanghai wins one group, they will win the championship. According to the situation, in the third singles, Mrs. Harris against Ms. Ge Lifei, Shanghai has a good chance of winning. In the first singles, Mrs. Hancock against Mrs. Kaito, there will be a competition. The order is as follows: Mrs. Hancock seven against Mrs. Kai　duo at 2:00 PM, Mrs. Ge Lifei against Mrs. Harris at　3:30 PM.</p>

<p>The wine was in a jar, passed around to each person. All three took a sip, tasting some. However, Ned and Tom really didn't like the bitter stuff. The cigars were even worse, but they didn't dare say so. Each of them took a few puffs until they felt dizzy or choked, and then passed the cigarette to the person next to them. Don, however, quite liked this approach, because he had the opportunity to imitate the lowlifes he used to associate with day and night, as if reliving a dream. He drank wine, smoked, swayed, and pretended to be like those people, and soon he even possessed the spirit of those people. So he lightly uttered cursing words. Tom had been following his example, but at this point suddenly stopped him, saying, "You can't be like that: cursing people to 'die a thousand deaths' and 'fall into hell'! It's vicious!"</p>
<p>"Kill, kill! Just play cards, don't preach; isn't it fun to curse people like this?"</p>
<p>"I'd rather say 'Thunder! Big Softshell Turtle'," Tom said, having created this amusing expletive himself and often using it by himself.</p>
<p>"I only say 'Evil spirit'; it sounds better," Ned added, but he was already quite impressed by Don's unrestrained manner.</p>

<p>Wang Hu, who once served as the governor of Jiangsu Province, had a dignified appearance and a humorous nature, and he was also quick-witted. When he followed Feng Huanzhang to live in Taiyuan, there was a man in his forties who accompanied him, and every morning he would pour the chamber pot for Wang. People suspected that he was Wang's servant, but upon inquiring, they learned that he was a former subordinate battalion commander. People secretly discussed it, saying that he should not flatter the official in this way, and the official should not use his subordinates in this way. Wang heard about it and said to the crowd, "Are you surprised that he pours the chamber pot for me? There is a hierarchy between us, but the relationship is that of friends. I also often pour the chamber pot for him." After saying this, he looked back at the man and said, "Is that right?" The man laughed loudly, and the crowd also laughed loudly. The suspicions were cleared up with one sentence.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong, there is a Lee Chi-shen Street, which is the property of the late wealthy businessman Lee Chi-shen. Someone in the neighborhood proposed a couplet: "Lee's own profit harms others, this is poverty and riches. Gods hate and ghosts despise, the street knows, the alley hears." This couplet has the same wonderful effect as a certain student's elegy for Kang Youwei: "A nation is about to perish, there must be... Old but not dead is..."</p>
<p>During the second year of the Republic, Yuan Shikai appointed Xiong Xiling as the Prime Minister of the State Council. Xiong and Zhang Jian, Liang Qichao, and others promoted each other and called it the first-class cabinet. People at the time ridiculed it with a couplet: "Turtle, bastard, egg. Phoenix, first-class." This is because Xiong's籍隶 belonged to the Fenghuang of Hunan.</p>

<p>The popular little tune "Peach Blossom River" has now become an absolutely extinct delicacy, but the impression that "there are many beauties on the Peach Blossom River" is probably deeply imprinted in everyone's mind.</p>
<p>It is said that the Peach Blossom River is in Hunan. I really dare not be dogmatic about whether there are many beauties on the Peach Blossom River, but because Hunan Province is the location of beautiful mountains and rivers, the emergence of men of letters, chivalrous men, and great revolutionary figures is indeed innumerable. Moreover, for modern revolutionary history, Hunan and the people of Hunan occupy a very important position.</p>
<p>However, in addition to Hunan's great relationship to culture, Hunan's mineral resources are also worth mentioning. Antimony ore is Hunan's largest mineral deposit. Hunan's antimony ore is not only the most abundant in China, but also ranks first in the world. Hunan's antimony ore is concentrated in the Xikuangshan and Yiyang areas. Antimony is an indispensable raw material for manufacturing military supplies, so its price was very high during the European War, making a very good deal. Only the output from the Xikuangshan area exceeded 1,300 tons per month.</p>
<p>Hunan's antimony ore accounted for half of the world's antimony production three years before the founding of the Republic of China. Now, thanks to diligent excavation, it accounts for 80% of the world's production. In addition to antimony ore, large amounts of aluminum, zinc, manganese, and other metal ores that occupy a very important position in the chemical industry are also produced.</p>
<p>In terms of agricultural products, rice, cotton, bamboo, wood, hemp, tea, etc. are all very developed. Moreover, tung oil has an amazing production. In the first year of the Republic of China, China's tung oil exports accounted for 17% of the total national exports. In the 18th year of the Republic of China, it increased to 45%. This refers to exports to foreign countries. All of these are white tung oil. The red tung oil produced is mostly transported to Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces.</p>
<p>From here, we can also see an overview of Hunan.</p>

<p>— Guanting</p>
<p>A friend, Mr. Qu's grandmother, lost her husband in her youth, but she raised three sons and lived to be over eighty years old before she died. At the time of her death, there were more than thirty children and grandchildren.</p>
<p>When she was critically ill, she suddenly took out one hundred copper coins from the Kangxi period of the previous Qing Dynasty, and handed them over to all the descendants and daughters-in-law to pass around and watch, and said: "The most painful thing in life is a young woman's widowhood. You can know the hardships of widowhood by looking at my one hundred large Kangxi coins. Whenever I felt uneasy at night, I would always scatter those one hundred coins on the floor in the room, and then go one by one to touch them up from the darkness until there were no less, so that I was mentally exhausted and easy to fall asleep, and forget everything. This is the only method I have used for decades of hard widowhood. Don't you see that every side of the one hundred Kangxi coins has not been polished by my fingers? Therefore, I deeply know that it is not only an extremely difficult thing for young women to be widows, but also an extremely cruel thing. You should all remember that if there is a young daughter-in-law in my family in the future who unfortunately loses her husband, do not persuade her to be a widow. You must know how much life is. In order to win the vanity of erecting a "Widow Memorial Archway" for my family, it is extremely inappropriate to force others to sacrifice their lifelong happiness..."</p>
<p>Nowadays, the so-called "chastity" issue is no longer valued by people in society, and there are fewer and fewer young widows observing chastity. The facts described in this article were told to me by my friend Mr. Qu in person, and I specifically recorded them to show the pain of widows who were under the old ethics in the past.</p>

<p>Ms. Soong Mei-ling is a leader in the women's world in our country, and is also known for her many talents. However, I had never seen her writing before. Yesterday, I happened to visit the Confucius Temple Park and entered the Municipal Library, where I read the September issue of the English-language Asia Magazine. There was Ms. Soong's work, entitled Little Ster Su (Su Xiaomei), which was based on the story of Su Xiaomei's three difficulties for the bridegroom in The Wonders of Today and Yesterday. After reading it, I felt very happy, thinking that I was fortunate to have encountered it, so I wrote this to tell the people of the country.</p>
<h3 id="e188">The Fragrant Mists of Imperial Incense Records <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling of Qing, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>However, in fact, once autumn arrives, dozens of gardeners who are specially responsible for taking care of chrysanthemums are so busy that they cannot do anything else all day long and still cannot have a moment to spare. For example, watering, fertilizing, transplanting, and covering with straw mats when there is strong sunshine or heavy rain, and taking off the straw mats after the rain and at night to allow them to fully absorb the dew; in addition, there were no insecticide powders invented at that time, so the work of removing insects also took up a lot of time.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of insects that can reproduce on chrysanthemums and carry out destructive work, and among them, a kind of small green insect that is good at drilling into the heart of the flower to wreak havoc is the most terrible. Before the chrysanthemum buds have grown, when the stems only have green leaves, there is no sign of them. When the buds gradually grow and are almost about to bloom, they come to the whole family uninvited, gathering on the stamens, chewing day and night, and often chewing all the flowers on one branch. Therefore, during a certain period of time, the work of catching insects is really extremely tense. More than twenty gardeners are divided into ten groups, two people in each group, one hitting two specially made tin cups, squatting on the ground, waiting for the other to shake the small green insects off each branch, but shaking them off is not reliable, and the heart of the flower must be separated and carefully searched in order to eliminate them all. Therefore, each flower takes six or seven minutes of work. We can imagine; there are more than 3,000 pots of chrysanthemums in the Imperial Garden, how much time will it take to inspect them all? No wonder those gardeners are so busy every day! (429)</p>

<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>About half a month ago, I published an article "Mourning Wang Junqing" in "Chun Qiu," mentioning the discovery of the missing "Zhongshan Travelogue" and "The Way to Health" from Shen Sanbai's "Six Records of a Floating Life." This article was seen by Mr. Wen Lían, who is very close to the humor master Lin Yutang. Yutang was in the process of translating "Six Records of a Floating Life" into English for the "Cosmopolitan" magazine, so he told him about this. Upon receiving this news, he was overjoyed and invited me to his residence for a chat.</p>
<p>That day, it was drizzling, and the autumn atmosphere was becoming more intense. I took a public bus to Yidingpan Road, walked past twenty or thirty shop fronts to find the entrance to No. 43A, which was a very secluded path. Both sides were lined with trees of varying heights, where cicadas perched, making continuous chirping sounds. Following the path straight in, turning right to the last house, was Mr. Lin's residence. The European-style building was surrounded by greenery, quietly without a sound. A gatekeeper led me in and I sat in the study. Mr. Li'an said, "Mr. Lin is at the Cultural Society and will be here shortly." I looked around and saw rows of books, half in Chinese and half in English. The Chinese books were mostly poetry and essays, and many were classics and histories that modern youth had rejected as old-fashioned. I asked Mr. Li'an, "What are Mr. Lin's views on old and new literature?" Mr. Li'an said, "Mr. Lin accepts new things while cherishing the old, without any prejudice. However, he is most opposed to Europeanized writing, regarding it as a pest in the literary world." As he said this, Mr. Lin returned, wearing a long white silk gown. He looked to be about forty years old, very sincere and amiable, shaking hands with me and exchanging a few pleasantries. He then led me to a small room where he wrote, which had a horizontal scroll inscribed by Ye Gongchuo that read "A Studio of Things Not Done." The desk was almost piled high with pens, ink, books, letters, and stationery. He pulled out a copy of the "Yan Lai Hong" magazine published by the Youzheng Bookstore and said, "This magazine publishes 'Six Records of a Floating Life' in installments. I wonder if there were any other published editions before this?" I replied, "The 'Six Records of a Floating Life' initially only existed in manuscript form. Wang Junqing discovered it and happily showed it to his friend Huang Moses, who happened to be compiling 'Yan Lai Hong' and published the manuscript. Later, Wang Junqing compiled 'Shuoku' and included it, which further spread its circulation." Mr. Lin then asked, "Where are the missing two records? Is it possible to find them?" I said, "The manuscript was with Junqing. After Junqing's death, I don't know who has preserved it. I will inquire by letter." He said, "Yu Pingbo's punctuated edition of 'Six Records' includes a landscape painting by the author, Shen Sanbai, and marks Shen's tomb at Fushou Mountain in Xikuatang. I would like to take a camera to Suzhou to find Shen's tomb and former residence." I said, "Suzhou has a tomb protection association, so the tomb should be accessible. However, the former residence has undergone many changes. According to Shen's account, he first lived near Canglang Pavilion and later moved to Cangmi Lane. I'm afraid even the elders can't pinpoint the exact location." At this point, the food was ready, and Mr. Lin invited me to dine. Besides Mr. Lin and Mr. Li'an, there were also two young ladies. His wife had gone out shopping. There were many dishes, all Fujianese style, including a large bowl of clear frog soup, which was exceptionally delicious. It was said to be Mr. Lin's favorite. With each dish served, Mr. Lin would ask the servant if any had been saved for his wife, showing the depth of his love for her. Soon, his wife returned. After being introduced by Mr. Lin, she shook hands with me and then rejoined the table. While eating, Mr. Lin was also reading a collection of sacred images. Confucius spoke of the need for both tension and relaxation. He smiled and said, "People say that humor can lead to the downfall of a country. But if one were to worry about the country and its people twenty-four hours a day, wouldn't that person become a madman? Can a madman save the country? The so-called 'tension and relaxation' of the sage is the way to adjust oneself." After the meal, he flipped through "Six Records of a Floating Life" again and said, "There is a person in the book named Hongqian, but some write it as Honggan. I don't know which is correct, as it greatly affects the transliteration." I said, "Although there is no way to verify this, judging from the sound, the word 'qian' is in the even tone and sounds louder, so 'qian' should be preferred." Mr. Lin agreed. He also asked, "Do Hengtang, Nanyuan, Wang's abandoned foundation, Wannian Bridge, and the Dongting Jun Shrine in Cuku Lane still exist? Are there still flower festival customs?" He also talked about the Lion Grove. He said, "I visited it a few years ago and felt that the layout was somewhat vulgar. However, every tree and stone in the Lion Grove was planted and arranged by famous masters, so I dare not criticize it. But after seeing 'Six Records of a Floating Life,' which says, 'Although the Lion Grove is said to be the work of Yunlin, and the stones are exquisite and there are many old trees, its overall layout is like a messy pile of coal, covered with moss and riddled with ant holes, completely lacking the atmosphere of mountains and forests. With my limited understanding, I cannot appreciate its beauty,' Shen Sanbai's words resonate with my own feelings. It is truly admirable." Then Mr. Lin said, "Besides 'Six Records of a Floating Life,' there is also 'You Meng Ying' ('Shadows in a Dream') that can be introduced to the West. I am currently preparing to translate it." I knew that Mr. Lin was very busy as an editor for five publications, so I dared not take up too much of his time. I bid farewell and left. He saw me to the door and earnestly made arrangements for a future meeting.</p>

<p>Chapter 19: The Senior Official Cherishes His Reputation and Has a Knack for Knocking on Doors; The New Lover Leaves Her Flesh and Blood and Has No Way to Visit the Sick</p>
<p>Shi Lian said, "Doesn't the new madam want to go back and see her family? And Brother Duocai won't let her go? Well, then, I'll represent the new madam." Jia Duocai couldn't help but exclaim "Oh my!" and laughed, "How can you represent my new madam? I wouldn't dare, I wouldn't dare!" Yueying, crouching in the corner by the wall, couldn't help but giggle. Shi Lian blushed and couldn't speak for a long time. He rubbed his hands nervously and laughed, "Even if you want to take advantage of me, I wouldn't mind. Who told us to be old friends for so many years? I haven't finished my sentence. What I mean is, since the new madam can't get away, and fortunately his residence isn't far, I can go there on his behalf to see how his grandmother is doing. If she's well? Naturally, I'll come back immediately to give the new madam a message. If she's not well? I might as well represent you in finding a doctor to see her. This is not a joke, this is a serious matter.") Yueying wanted to go back, but Duocai wouldn't let her, so she could only worry. Now that she heard that Li Shilian was willing to go, she stopped crying, nodded slightly to him, as if to salute him, and said, "Mr. Li, you have such a kind heart, you will definitely have good fortune in the future, you will definitely be promoted and become wealthy." Shilian ignored her words and smiled at Duocai. Duocai said, "I have no objections. But you can understand what kind of people they are, they are only thinking about money." When Yueying heard these words, although she didn't dare to say anything, she only lifted her eyelids and stared at Duocai twice. Duocai laughed instead and said, "Now that Mr. Li is willing to be your representative, you can rest assured." Although Yueying couldn't help but smile, when she thought about the kind of life she was living, she immediately suppressed her smile and lowered her head. But even though she lowered her head, the small dimples on her cheeks were so charming that they were captivating. (329)</p>

<p>Finance: The Mobilization Order in Argentina Dampens the Gold Market's Momentum; Major Players Remain Cautious</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market's momentum failed to pick up and remained weak. The overall situation was calm, lacking any special developments. Major players mostly took a wait-and-see approach. However, the spot market eased due to news of Argentina's mobilization order. In the early morning, the overseas silver market in both the UK and the US was flat. The forward silver price in Monte Video narrowed by 2.5 to 3 basis points. Exchange rates fluctuated. London spot gold fell by half a penny. Reports indicated that Argentina had issued a general mobilization order, and the international situation was becoming urgent again. People seemed to be moving towards action. Although the off-market pre-market price was called out at 88.89 yuan, it lacked support. For a time, supply exceeded demand, and prices gradually fell, dropping to within 4 yuan. Major players then came to the rescue, managing to pull it up. However, the opening was low. The central bank's official rate was announced, with both the UK and the US flat, and the customs gold unit unchanged. The standard gold price was lowered to 920.5 yuan. After opening, the market was stable, and the exchange rate hardened, gradually declining after rising. Banks propped it up and then stuffed it down, with the market briefly falling. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's official rate was unchanged. Afterwards, the market was propped up again. Later, Sassoon propped up the pound, and the exchange rate tightened. Buyers were slightly more eager, causing the price to rise, but unfortunately, market sentiment was mediocre. Many people sold at high prices, causing another decline. However, supply and demand balanced. The forecast for Indian silver was a drop of three annas. At noon, the market remained stable. However, it weakened after closing. The after-market opened steadily, with slight improvements. However, due to negative sentiment, major players sold slightly, causing a faster and weaker decline. The first telegram from India indicated that silver had rebounded by two annas. The exchange rate hardened and fell. However, buyers maintained the price, so the exchange rate remained supported despite easing. The situation fluctuated. Later, the second telegram from India showed a small rebound of two annas. This was followed by rumors that the central bank had opened 350 bars, causing more buying and a gradual rise. However, it ultimately closed flat. Public bonds for October began to be redeemed today. Shorts had already redeemed more than 85% yesterday. A record of today's market situation follows.</p>
<p>The morning opened at 884.6 yuan, down 1.8 yuan from last Saturday. Dadecheng, Yongli, Hengyu, and others advanced from 4.4 yuan to Yongshoutiao and then fell to 2.3 yuan. Dadecheng, Chunyuan, Yonghuixiang, and Hengyu continuously purchased strips. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's official rate was expected to be unchanged. Maccari bought US dollars for November at 6.25, gradually rising. Sassoon also propped up the pound for November at 3.75, rising to 7.5 yuan. Yongli, Xifeng, Yongda, Dadecheng took advantage of the high price to sell strips, dropping to 5.3 yuan. Hengyu initially advanced and then exited, briefly rising to 2.3 yuan, but still declined. In addition, Fuyu and Dadecheng sold and retreated to 4.8 yuan. Dingkang and Yongli bought strips at the low, slightly maintaining the price. Dadecheng or Fuyu and others came to sell, causing the price to fall to 3.6 yuan. Dadecheng Jinjiang Ding Zhengchang, Tongtaichang took advantage of the low to advance again, rising to 5.1 yuan. Dadecheng Maoyong still sold, causing the price to fall to within 4 yuan. However, Hengyu, Fuxing, Yongtong, Taichang, Yingxiang and others advanced, and the Indian silver forecast was a small three annas, rising to 5 yuan. After this, the situation was mediocre, without any special changes. After fluctuating, the market closed at 884.7 yuan at noon, weakening after closing, falling to within 3 yuan.</p>
<p>The after-market opened at 883.1 yuan. Hengyu and Huixiang advanced from 3 yuan to 4.1 yuan. Yongli, Hengchang, Yonghengyu, Chunyuan, Yong and others sold in succession. The domestic market hardened, falling to 1.2 yuan. Although Fuxing and Yonghuixiang advanced to 2.3 yuan, the first report from Indian silver indicated a rise of two annas. Dadecheng, Hengyu, Huixiang, Yingfeng, and Heng sold strips, causing the price to fall to 1.2 yuan again. Fuxing, Yonghong, Kangyong, Hengyu, Richang, and Dadecheng gradually advanced to 3.8 yuan. Maccari released US dollars for October at 8 yuan. Dada, Fuyu, Huixiang, Fuxing, Yong all sold, causing the price to fall to 2.4 yuan again.

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw nervous sentiment due to the tense situation in both the East and West. The arrival of Japanese warships in Shantou was particularly frightening. The future of Japan's actions was difficult to predict. The market atmosphere was suddenly tense and then relaxed. However, judging from the closing situation, the northern gangs frantically sold, indicating a pessimistic outlook. After the morning opening, selling pressure surged. Editing and demobilization fell 4.5 jiao, and the rest also declined. However, the salt tax and short-term gold still saw some lifting, remaining slightly firm at 0.5 to 1 jiao. The 96 also forcibly raised by 1 jiao. In the secondary market, the top positions saw some temporary short covering, rebounding about 1 jiao. After the 20th level, the selling trend started again, and short-term gold plummeted by 8 jiao. In the afternoon opening, the declining trend continued for 3.4 jiao. Suddenly, at the 23rd level, there was another lifting, raising by 2 jiao, making a whole 6 and 4 jiao. The situation seemed to have slightly turned around. Although the top positions were said to be stable before closing, the late-night news was bad. Selling pressure in the north was strong, and the 22nd level turned weak again, becoming more and more severe. The distant forward contract for a whole 6 plummeted by 7 jiao, creating a reverse spread, which was not a good sign. As for the selling side, the northern gangs were enthusiastic with numbers 14, 69, and 73. The rest, such as numbers 4, 15, 16, and 48, were also selling. The long positions of number 54 had also begun to waver. On the buying side, number 33 was active in covering shorts. The rest, such as numbers 20 and 78, also saw some buying. In total, the market prices all declined, ranging from 0.4 jiao to 9.5 jiao. The total number of transactions was 20,001,600 yuan.

Before closing, demand for auto stocks turned strong. Wheat exchange stocks were mixed. The bond market was sluggish but fairly firm. Half-day trading volume was 520,000 shares.

<p>The yarn market initially declined in the morning but recovered at noon. The overall situation felt sluggish, and market transactions were weak, indicating a decline in commerce. Initially, the sentiment was poor due to negative news and the drop in securities prices last Saturday, which further dampened confidence. There was also speculation that yarn received in the September term might be delivered in the October term, causing weakness. In the afternoon, news of potential conflict in Italy spurred buying, leading to a market rebound. Prices for March term standard Japanese yarn rose by two to three yuan compared to the previous month.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Bulls Sell Off</p>
<p>At the opening of the yarn market, prices for all months declined uniformly, showing weakness. This was attributed to unfavorable news, tight credit, and fears that yarn received in the previous month would be delivered in the October term. As a result, speculators panicked and increased selling. Prices for each month fell by eight to nine jiao to one yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The market remained sluggish at the afternoon opening, but after two or three rounds of auctions, it suddenly rebounded. It was reported that spot sales of cotton yarn remained strong, with a significant volume of 1,500 bales traded. Factories' inventories were visibly decreasing. In inland areas such as Nuxí, Hankou, and Tianjin, inventories were low, unlike in the past, thus maintaining stability. However, securities brokers sold off their long positions, resulting in prices for each month rising by two, three, five, and seven jiao compared to the morning closing price. Sales included 800 bales from Mei Ji, 650 bales from Mingde, 300 bales from Rui Da, 300 bales from Run Kang, 300 bales from Xie Cheng, 950 bales from Jin Chang, and 200 bales from Yuan Yi.

<p>The cotton market initially fell but then rose, showing an upward trend. As new cotton from various regions gradually entered the market, there were signs of abundant supply. Most people had a bearish outlook, and the overseas cotton market remained sluggish. However, sellers still felt a shortage, making significant market changes difficult.</p>
<p>Flowers: Chang He and Run</p>
<p>At the opening of the yarn flower market, prices for cotton flower initially declined due to a uniform downward trend in American and Indian cotton markets, causing a bearish outlook. Selling pressure increased, further weakened by the depressed yarn market. The overall tone was slightly looser. As a result, prices for all months fell by one and a half to two jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. The market remained flat at the afternoon opening, but after two or three rounds of auctions, it suddenly tightened. It was reported that Japanese traders purchased another 2,000 bales of abundant cotton for delivery to packing factories, boosting confidence. Speculators actively covered their short positions. One company made significant purchases, while Chang He and Run Kang tended to sell off. As a result, prices for all months rose by five fen to one and a half jiao compared to the morning closing price. Sales included 1,000 dan from Tong Ji, 1,600 dan from Shen Ji, 4,300 dan from Run Kang, 600 dan from Sheng Yuan, 700 dan from Xin Heng, 5,800 dan from Chang He, 1,200 dan from Da Feng, and 800 dan from He Xing.

<p>War Affects Indian and Egyptian Cotton Industry</p>
<p>Last week, the cotton market was firm, but it later showed a slight reversal. Speculators and futures traders bought due to the urgency of war. Japanese traders also made purchases, but as prices rose, long positions were liquidated, causing the market to soften again. There was spot activity, with manufacturers and transporters inquiring. East African cotton also improved due to better demand from the industry. The weather continues to be favorable, with recent sunny conditions benefiting cotton. The weekly statistics are appended below (in thousands of bales):</p>

<p>Tianjin Cotton Yarn Sales Improve in Autumn</p>
<p>(Tianjin Correspondence) Autumn sales of cotton yarn in this city are improving. Customers' appetite remains healthy, and the Tianjin market is experiencing a shortage of supply, leading to positive sentiment. Qingdao yarn is being shipped to Tianjin in large quantities. Bao Di Firm purchased 25 bales of 17-count yarn and 25 bales of 16-count yarn. Baofu Firm purchased 50 bales of 10-count yarn, and Baigou Firm purchased 100 bales of 10-count and 12-count yarn.

<h3 id="e196">Oil Market: White Tung Oil Appears Strong but is Weak Inside - Various Production Areas Hasten Shipments - <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>White tung oil has been almost entirely gathered from various production areas by foreign firms. Although the current market is experiencing wild price increases, the quantities are extremely small. Ten or twenty tons is considered a large amount, and even three or five tons are enough to open a trading session. Therefore, although prices are rising daily, it cannot be considered a normal market. Last week, the Hankou market rose to 80 yuan per unit, and has since increased to 84 yuan per unit. However, the higher the price, the greater the fear, as the current situation has reached a peak. If foreign firms relax their grip, prices will plummet. If they fall by half, 40 or 50 yuan would still be considered a high price. Therefore, although the price surge is scorching hot, people are uneasy, feeling that the market is strong on the surface but weak inside. Even considering futures oil, with December delivery having exceeded 60 yuan, recent sales from Wanxian were only around 57 or 58 yuan in Hankou. Foreign firms are not as eager to purchase futures as before, so there is a gradual downward trend. Various production areas are increasing output for November and December, and even more so now. Regardless of the situation in Sichuan, Hunan, and Hubei, it is reported that the output from Guizhou province, exported via Hong Kong, could reach thousands of tons in November and December. All are eager to sell at high prices, which is evident in the attitude of European and American firms.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to stabilize, and transactions were limited. The association's set price for spot 24-group white sugar was 16.95 yuan, with 400-500 bags traded. Transit goods were priced at 5.25 yuan. There were no changes in the prices quoted by the Later Industry Cooperative.

Some Chaozhou firms offered top-grade refined red sugar at 12.60 yuan and second-grade at 12.30 yuan, with over 200 bags traded, up three to four jiao. Additionally, 104 bags of Chongtiqing were sold at 10.50 to 10.55 yuan, and 116 bags of ordinary Huanggangqing were sold at 9.80 yuan.</p>

<p>Initially, new walnuts were not very dry, so only 11 or 12 bags of miscellaneous walnuts were opened, resulting in losses. Supply decreased accordingly. Recently, there have been some continued arrivals, and the quality is now dry, so prices have risen. It is reported that Haozhou walnuts have risen to 16 yuan, up three or four yuan, and remain tight.</p>

<p>Due to rumors that the Grain Exchange has scheduled a sesame auction for October 15, using foreign firms' 98% net goods standard with 25-ton lots, spot transactions in the market have become more active, and the market atmosphere is quite tense. Yesterday, it was estimated that 500 bags of Yangzhou sesame, 200 bags of Taizhou sesame, 572 bags of Danyang sesame, 100 bags of Guandian sesame, 50 bags of Chongming sesame, 51 bags of Mingguang sesame, and 435 bags of Nanjing net sesame were traded. Foreign firm transactions, on the other hand, were slow. Since Jardine Matheson traded 300 tons of November-December delivery at 8.40 yuan last Thursday, there have been no further transactions. Currently, the overall trend is stable as sellers are unwilling to sell cheaply.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the end of the September flour delivery period. A total of 160,000 bags of flour were delivered to the warehouses, including 40,000 bags by artillery transport and 120,000 bags by military ship. Most of these were received by banking firms for hedging purposes, with only a small portion going to trading firms. Additionally, more than 200,000 bags were delivered directly outside the warehouses, also mostly for hedging purposes.</p>
<p>The delivery volume for September standard wheat was only two trucks, received by Zhi Cheng Yong Yu No. 2 broker, and delivered by Ding Tai. The originally scheduled nine trucks for delivery were bought back by the brokers to offset the delivery. Wheat inventories are gradually depleting, with less than 100,000 bags remaining in the city. Some are already in the hands of trading companies, and some have been hedged into the standard. Therefore, the floating inventory in the market is even thinner, and there is not much inventory in the production areas. Production area prices are high, making it difficult to profit. If there are no opportunities for foreign wheat to arrive, the wheat market is expected to remain positive.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, supplies from various firms were particularly scarce, with only shipments arriving for the 15th and 16th (totaling over 3,000 dan). Retail sales were also sluggish. Prices were indiscriminately lowered by various firms. Yantai firms handled only about 200 bags, so there was no improvement. New rice from Hexia was out of stock. Only 200-300 bags of Baige rice were handled, and the market situation was stable. Qingjiao Shenzhong rice was also on the market yesterday, with crystal-clear quality and a price of 9.60 yuan. There was no change in the price of new Chu tips. The price of new Yang tips rose by one jiao. Prices for old shade-dried rice remained flat.</p>

<p>Xitang Yang Tips: 7.70 7.80 Up one jiao</p>
<p>Su Tong Yang Tips: 8.20 8.20 Up one jiao</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, supplies from various routes in Hexia were 34th and 35th grade. The market for various goods was sluggish, with high-grade japonica rice stagnating and medium- and low-grade rice continuing to be delivered. High-grade rice prices softened, while medium- and low-grade rice prices remained stable. Retail sales of Dongxin rice were slightly better, and the market situation stabilized. Although the arrival of Western new japonica rice was not strong, retail sales were sluggish. High-grade prices were down by one jiao, while medium- and low-grade prices were down by two chi. Prices for self-milled rice were also down by about one jiao. Prices for Baige rice were weak. New Yang tips, port tips, guest tips, and retail splits were continuously taken, and prices remained stable. Thin rice prices stabilized. New Du tips were up by about one jiao, while medium- and low-grade prices were down by two jiao. There were no significant changes in the prices of other goods.</p>
<p>(Guest Indica) Shipments continued to arrive from Jiangxi, Ningbo, southern Jiangsu, northern Jiangsu, Zhangzhou, etc. Demand from this street was even stronger. Newly arrived Ningbo, Nanjing, and Jiangxi rice were quickly sold. Ningbo, Hubei, and Nanjing rice firms competed for supplies, and the market atmosphere was very good. Hubei white rice and Nanjing Chexian rice both rose by two jiao to one and a half jiao. Other indica rice also followed suit. It was estimated that 1,429 bags of Ningbo rice, 1,610 bags of Nanjing rice, 700 bags of Jiangxi rice, 300 bags of northern Jiangsu rice, and 100 bags of Tongzhou rice were sold, all handled by this street.</p>
<p>(Foreign Rice) The market has been stable due to the persistence of traders and warehouses. However, as supplies of guest indica rice have gradually increased, it has been difficult to raise foreign rice prices. Yesterday, however, the northern firms handled 500 bags of Borneo machine rice, this street handled 1,500 bags of small-grained rice, and 50 bags of Saigon white rice. The market remained relatively strong.</p>

<p>Yesterday, green tea trading was still strong. Fine eyebrow tea from Luzhuang and plain pearl tea from French firms were sold. The whole city was purchased by Tianxiang, Baochang, Tongfu, Yongxing, and other firms and other merchants, with more than 300 boxes bought in total. Fine eyebrow tea prices fell by two or three yuan compared to the previous week. Pearl tea prices were unchanged. In addition, Xie He, Tong Fu and other firms also managed needle eyebrow, beautiful eyebrow and other green teas. However, these kinds of broken tea are mostly shipped to East Africa, for sales. In this time of urgent European war, tea merchants are forced to purchase missing quantities to prepare for any potential transport blockade.</p>

<p>After the blue lead market sharply rose in price, Shanghai inventory is low and the amount of new goods arriving is small. Because of this there is a sharp rise in the market, up to 18 yuan per load, more than 1 yuan up from previously. Since the military stopped the use of garden lead wire, yesterday various firms from Xi'an and Hankou suddenly rose to gather it, thus there are five, six, seven or eight hundred bundles in the market. The market price is about 1.10 yuan, good for one jiao and a half more than previously. It's heard that this is being put on sale by various metal shops on the northern side of Suzhou Road.</p>

<h3 id="e204">Common Sense Ethical Views and YAMAMOTO Yūzō <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Xiangshan</p>
<p>Because of the play "Infanticide", Yamamoto Yūzō has become a very well-known playwright in our country. In fact, Yamamoto Yūzō is also a very outstanding figure among Japanese playwrights.</p>
<p>In Japan, those who can be called playwrights are indeed as rare as morning stars. People like Kubota Mantarō, Yoshii Isamu, Masamune Hakuchō, Tanizaki Jun'ichirō, and the one-act play expert Kikuchi Kan are mostly novelists or poets. Those who can truly be called playwrights are only Okamoto Kido, Kishida Kunio, and Yamamoto Yūzō. Among them, the existence of Okamoto Kido is still half based on feudal kabuki, while Yamamoto Yūzō is different. He inherited the naturalistic atmosphere of the Taishō era, focusing on the expression of realistic daily life. Because his plays have a tight structure, he has received very good reviews. Therefore, some people have commented that he is very similar to Ibsen, which is not an excessive evaluation.</p>
<p>His works can be said to be consistently interwoven with common sense ethical views. Because of this, he cannot escape the so-called superficial "sense of morality." He only uses this common sense ethical view to deal with and respond to the real society. Moreover, he can only discover the lack of this common sense ethical view in the current society, but he cannot go deeper to grasp the root of the problem. Taking the well-known "Infanticide" as an example, we can understand the full picture of Yamamoto Yūzō's common sense ethical view.</p>
<p>The story of "Infanticide" is as follows: A policeman named Koyama, due to poverty, was unable to treat his wife and son's illnesses, and they eventually died. Thus, he lived a life of hardship with his daughter. At this time, he deeply felt that his wife and son's deaths were caused by himself because he did not have the money to treat them.</p>
<p>At this time, a female worker who pulls earth killed and buried her own baby, but it was eventually discovered. Later, this woman came to Koyama to plead her case. Koyama angrily rebuked her for harming an innocent life, wanting to tie her up and beat her. But after the woman explained that in order to support her family, she had to kill the baby who was hindering her from working, and that she thought it was better for the child to die than to suffer in the world, he showed great sympathy and comforted her, saying: "In court, this crime may be leniently punished depending on the circumstances."</p>
<p>From the above story, we can see several significant facts. First, the character Koyama is the entire representative of Yamamoto Yūzō's thoughts, that is, full of a strong ethical view and sense of morality. Second, the female worker's killing of the baby is a very common sense event. Third, the current society's laws still protect these poor people.</p>
<p>The author's depiction of the central character Koyama, his deep love for his dead wife and children, his loyalty to his duties, his gentle heart towards his daughter, and his initial anger towards the criminal followed by comfort, can be said to be a picture of the kindest and most moral human being. However, whether this kind of human being truly exists in this world is a major question. Needless to say, this is the author's ideological construction, trying to concretely express many abstract common sense ethical views in this character.</p>
<p>As for the common phenomenon of infanticide, it is an extraordinary fact. Although Yamamoto Yūzō recognized the impropriety of this society that produces such tragedies, he still adhered to maintaining the morality of the current society's laws. While Ibsen's problem plays raise many questions, they also hold suspicion and distrust towards the current society. However, Yamamoto Yūzō is different. He only writes about some unreasonable tragedies in this society, but he still believes that society can be rationalized, and he still believes in the existence of characters constructed by his ethical views.</p>
<p>Here, we might as well use "Crown of Life" as an example. The general plot of this play is as follows: A merchant who runs a crab meat canning factory accepts a direct order from England, thus arousing the jealousy of intermediary traders. They start to disrupt their crab production by having crab fishermen raise crab prices, causing the factory to lose money. So the factory owner's younger brother decides to buy cheap crabs such as small crabs and female crabs to mix in, in order to avoid losses. However, the older brother absolutely refuses to do this kind of deceptive behavior, because he believes that it is detrimental to the merchant's morality and the commercial reputation of Japan. As a result, he resolutely buys expensive crabs, leading to bankruptcy, and leaves the house and factory that have already been sold to others with his sick wife, younger brother, and sisters.</p>
<p>This is a tragedy, the downfall of a person who faithfully adheres to common sense morality. Needless to say, in the author's intention, it is an attack on the hypocrisy and evil of the current world, but at the same time, he still believes in: "Those who can maintain eternal honesty, I can give them this glorious crown of life." This is also his belief in this ethical concept, that no matter what difficulties and failures are encountered, they can finally obtain this final crown of life. This kind of thinking constitutes the true life of Yamamoto Yūzō's plays, and at the same time, it also reveals Yamamoto Yūzō's backwardness.</p>
<p>Finally, I must point out the advantages of his plays and his method. What are his advantages and method? He can observe a phenomenon from various angles, and knows how to grasp an event as a combination of various relationships. He can see a complex structure from simple things, and knows that daily life contains more meaning than extraordinary things. This can be understood by reading his novel, "Wave." Another point is the tight structure of his plays. This tightness brings about the overall effect of his plays.</p>
<p>As for his other works, there are "Comrades," Professor Tsuda, etc. His novel "A Woman's Life" has also received very good reviews. This novel has some similarities with Maupassant's "A Woman's Life." Needless to say, the strength of Maupassant's "A Woman's Life," according to Tolstoy, is that it has first: the author's proper relationship with the subject matter, that is, a moral relationship. Second, the expression is accurate and beautiful (these two are consistent). Third, honesty, in other words, a genuine feeling of love for the subject matter taken. Yamamoto Yūzō's "A Woman's Life" also gained considerable prestige because of its emphasis on moral relationships and the use of the naturalistic method. But according to Teshima Tetsuzo, "The success of this novel is half due to the harvest of transplanting the tight writing method of his plays into the novel."</p>
<h3 id="e205">Ant Life <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Ling Mo</p>
<p>It is probably worthy of getting mocked to pity for the life of a fly. In reality, I myself also don't forget that old story: a summer cicada, happily singing songs from a tree branch, not hurrying, while an ant is busily working under the hot sun. In winter the ant survives off of its preserved stores of grain, while the cicada starves to death on the road. Thus, the cicada's death is not only lighter than a feather, it is plainly so light it can't even compare to its own wings. The meaning of this lesson is to teach us that the cicada's death is deserved. However, I feel that putting this great effort into explaining that it's not a pity for the cicada to die, in the end we are still taking this death too seriously. In reality, it is that ant that is praised in the story, and from the human's perspective, its death is also just a small ant life.</p>
<p>Though in the mood of creating a fable, at times even flower and grass, wood and stone, are endowed with a life, people are always possessing the desire of exclusively occupying the function of life. With one more thing possessing life in the universe, a person knows that their own privileged rights to enjoy have suffered one more level of stripping. Because of that, humans are constantly doing the work of denying the life of others, destroying the life of others, and despising the life of others. And micro-organisms are the most despised; they are diminished to the furthest extent, so in the eyes of a hunter, no matter flying bird or running animal, they are all just a few bugs. All of this is life worthy of scorn, that is worth being exterminated. Of course, there are also those who fret that if the world reaches a day when besides humans there aren't any other forms of life, that it will be an extremely boring world. But those living in cities where there aren't fierce beasts and aren't scorpions and snakes intruding, probably all hope that in the future there won't even be a single fly or a single bed bug. Though that is just the attitude towards the life we can despise, and towards life worthy of admiration, it is naturally not completely the same. However, the difference is really just a limit; mankind towards life that is completely under its control, is not acknowledging the existence of that life, and is already prepared to destroy it at any time upon discovering that it is loathsome.</p>
<p>Mankind has built up ten-thousand years of the history of destroying life of other forms, and in the present there is still much life that exists and has not been destroyed, and that can only be said to be by chance. These lives are only able to exist, because the steps that mankind takes are pretty chaotic; humans themselves do not know that humans are just other humans. Everyone takes themselves to be the ones surviving after the flood, and that their own survival is from having admirable nature, while those bearing sins, can only be destroyed in the flood. The hope for the world to have another flood, is hidden within the heart of just a certain portion of people, and that is without question. There are even some people that simply hope to possess divine-like power and to transform the world all over once. The so-called world culture from before the European War, and today the current catchphrase of "pure Aryan bloodlines", are all containing the danger that a portion of humanity will be destroyed. Comparing to the facts of the past, knowing all of this is not an absurd worry. In the past there were many human deaths that substituted for the killing of bugs and ants, and even today, there are some who are even fantasizing that humanity will probably bring its own total annihilation, so that the future world will be the ant world.</p>
<p>Here I am not at all intending to say that humankind should abandon their self-destructive actions, or using all its strength to fight against ants. The conjecture that the future is the world of ants, after all, is just a fable. In fables there are often lessons, but the lessons are often not necessarily good. The old fables compared to new fables, are in reality the same, they indicate to the people how to maintain their lives. Humans in reality have already become overly familiar with this, and that is why when straying upon a considerably distant fork in the road, returning to the starting point does not necessarily prevent a re-straying onto the same fork. Averting the self-destruction of humanity, or eliminating the psychology of despising other forms of life, are probably not necessary. Then do we believe in the old saying of all things breeding and growing along with me, not harming each other? Of course not, just not harming so that it is constantly annoying you.</p>
<h3 id="e206">In Memory of a Lost Child <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Zi</p>
<p>A month ago, when my hometown was completely submerged, I received letters from both my sister and my wife's family, reporting that there was a severe epidemic raging there. Nine out of ten children were suffering from malaria and dysentery, and unfortunately, my son had also been infected. They wanted me to quickly send money to pray to the gods and buy medicine, hoping for some improvement. The child's symptoms were: cold limbs, constant watery diarrhea, unfocused eyes, etc.</p>
<p>At the time, I didn't show the letters to my mother and wife, because they were both still ill. Moreover, I knew that with such symptoms in a flood, there was absolutely no hope of recovery.</p>
<p>I secretly hung my heart up! Behind my mother and wife's back, I ran around everywhere, looking for money everywhere. Sometimes, I would hide away somewhere alone, facing the dim sky of my hometown, quietly, silently for a long time! Slowly, from those flying, floating wisps of clouds, I conjured up our vast village, houses, and fields. I saw thousands upon thousands of disaster victims, their bellies like leaves, lying on hard rocks! I saw animals drifting aimlessly! I saw the wailing of women and children! I saw the old and weak, those who couldn't withstand the torment, voluntarily, secretly crawling! Rolling! ... into the water.</p>
<p>I looked everywhere for my beloved son, but I couldn't see him. Was he dead? Or was he still among those sick, garbage-like, haggard crowds? I began to resent my eyes. I strained to open them wide! Wide! I wiped them with a towel! Finally, I couldn't see anything: dark clouds gathered from all directions, thunder and lightning intertwined, a huge, mountain-like black spot pressing down directly on my head.</p>
<p>As soon as my senses returned, I became even clearer: my child was undoubtedly beyond saving! Like the other disaster victims, he would have been lying on the hard rocks with his leaf-like belly, crying out to his cruel mother and heartless father!</p>
<p>I deeply regretted that I shouldn't have been so focused on the hardships of life, and so easily, so heartlessly left him alone in our hometown. What was happening now? What was happening? ... Ah! How could I ever erase the deep condemnation in my heart?</p>
<p>Perhaps there was still a chance! Send the money quickly! I thought to myself, trying to comfort myself. I tried my best to put on a calm and composed demeanor, and I didn't let my mother and wife know anything.</p>
<p>One afternoon, I went out to see a friend and was away from home for about three or four hours. It was already late when I returned. As soon as I entered the door, I heard a sharp, agonizing wail that pierced from my ears straight into my heart! I staggered and stood by the door. I knew that something extraordinary had already happened! My body trembled, almost shrinking into a ball!</p>
<p>My mother suddenly rushed out of the room, clutching my clothes! The sixty-three-year-old woman was like a drunk, her voice hoarse from crying! She cursed me as a heartless beast, only caring about my own life and not cherishing my children! She even said that I didn't tell her about the child's illness sooner. My wife was prostrate on the ground, holding the child's photo, spitting up black blood! My other daughter, who was already three years old, was also wailing in terror because of this sudden turmoil!</p>
<p>My eyes were blurred and confused! My breathing was rapid! My hot tears rolled down like a broken string of pearls! Ignoring their crying, I reached for the ominous letter on the table, soaked with tears and blood:</p>
<p>"... Died because there was no money for treatment! ... It was so pitiful, it was on the morning of the 27th of the seventh lunar month! ... Many children are dying here! ... Adults too! ... People here are living the lives of ghosts, walking the road to death day by day! ..."</p>
<p>My eyes went dark, and I couldn't see any more of the words.</p>
<p>Late at night, when their crying had subsided somewhat, I tried my best to bear the pain and quietly comforted my wife:</p>
<p>"What's the point of crying anymore? People like us, born into a world like this, shouldn't have children in the first place! If we have them, then they die! What good does crying do? Wouldn't the child suffer if he stayed with us? Isn't our hometown losing adults by the thousands? Hunger, disease! ... Look at all the blood and phlegm you just coughed up! ..."</p>
<p>My wife looked at me, biting her pale lips, her eyes red; despairingly, faintly, she said:</p>
<p>"Why? Why do we have to suffer like this? Our child! Our hometown! ..."</p>

<p>Original by George Bernard Shaw, translated by Ting</p>
<p>—That is really bad. What have you endured? Don't say those pretty words to me. Please tell me straightforwardly. Having hired a lawyer with your money, you now have the privilege to tell him most of your private affairs. Don't remember that we are old friends, just remember that I am your lawyer. Besides, you don't need to say anything else to me. I have heard things like yours from the mouths of husbands sitting in that chair more than fifty times. Do you think you are the only one in the world who has disagreements with his wife?</p>
<p>—I can bet anything you like that you have never heard a case like mine. I can make it clear if you will let me know.</p>
<p>—Okay, then listen to me. Have you ever heard a woman say to her husband, "Nature has given her a special nature that makes people want to talk to her about love, but she considers it a sin and doesn't practice it"?</p>
<p>—That's because she wants you to talk to her about love.</p>
<p>—Yes: she has done that; and says it is so good, she has made me improve so much, and now she wants to keep doing it to make other people improve. She says it's like a talent for raising children. Any woman who has this talent, she says, is like running a school and providing education. They are so clever at this that they neglect their own children and pursue the children of others. In the same way, she argues, a woman should use that talented love to make people improve, should improve many, many more people. What do you think?</p>
<p>The lawyer felt a little sympathy and said:</p>
<p>—There's some truth in that, you know.</p>
<p>—What?</p>
<p>—Of course, I mean in terms of reason. Actually, that kind of thing is impossible; however, there's no malicious intent in it. Regarding this matter, I feel it's hard to find a suitable solution.</p>
<p>—That's what she said.</p>
<p>—Hey, so what did you say to her?</p>
<p>—I told her that the proper solution to this is: she herself should suffer.</p>
<p>—Did that do any good?</p>
<p>—No good at all.</p>
<p>—Does she dislike you already?</p>
<p>—No. She reports that she is willing to continue working with me, but she has become bored with me, so there must be a new interest growing in her life. Now, what do you say to your opponent?</p>
<p>—My opponent! Have I said a word for her?</p>

<p>— Fei Er</p>
<p>The small town is piled full of old things, built with feudal relics.—A person who lives in a small town for a long time will get a musty smell all over them.</p>
<p>The people in the small town are short-sighted, they can't see things that are far away, they don't care about things outside their immediate surroundings. They are busy all day long for their families and lives, calculating trivial matters the size of a needle all day long.</p>
<p>The small town is just a lonely small town; it has nothing to do with the world, and it has nothing to do with all of humanity.</p>
<p>Only when one dog fights another dog in the small town, or when one pig gives birth to twelve piglets, will it be noticed by the townspeople.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is a local emperor in the small town, whose power exceeds that of any emperor in the world; therefore, there is also an eternal fool in the small town, whose fate is destined to be a stupid member who can never turn over.</p>
<p>The books that people in the small town read are "Laughing Grove Anecdotes," and those infected with modern airs read "The Analects"; the novels that people in the small town read are "Seven Swordsmen and Thirteen Knights," and the new-style talented scholars and beautiful ladies read "Tears and Laughter Marriage" or Zhang Ziping-style novels.</p>
<p>Occasionally, a gust of wind blows, and the small town is completely stirred up. Then there is unrest, disputes, fights, shootings, or even revenge, but after the wind blows, the small town returns to calm, like an ancient well that has been silent and waveless for thousands of years.</p>
<p>So the people in the small town are drilling in a narrow cave: like dung beetles, you crawl on my body, and I crawl on your body.</p>
<p>The crumbling frame of the small town is waiting for the second strong wind to blow, and it can all collapse.</p>
<p>During a short stay in the small town, I felt this way; I view all old small towns in the same way.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean that I'm praising big cities.</p>

<p>Shanghai Peiming Girls' Middle School Tenth Anniversary Special Issue</p>
<h3 id="e209">Foreword <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— (Jin Yuezhang)</p>
<p>Time flies, and fleeting moments disappear like a flash of lightning. Since the establishment of our Peiming Girls' Middle School, it has been ten years in the blink of an eye! We are pleased to celebrate the grand anniversary, reflecting on the difficulties of creation in the past and planning for future development. We respectfully present a brief account of the school's administrative evolution over the past ten years to our fellow countrymen:</p>
<p>Regarding Facilities: The school's buildings have moved three times. When it was first established in the autumn of the fourteenth year, it rented a private house in Xinqiao East, Maigen Road, Shanghai, with only three floors. In the eighteenth year, it moved to No. 32, Maigen Road, Xinqiao West, which was slightly expanded but still insufficient. In the nineteenth year, another building was rented at No. 20, Wuding Road, for the elementary school. In the twentieth year, the Maigen Road site was expanded, and the elementary school was moved back. It was not until the twenty-second year that a new site was found at No. 210, Maigen Road, with its quiet gardens, spacious classrooms, large playground, and clean dormitories, providing a place for hundreds of students to rest, relax, and play. As for the internal improvements, there is also much to mention, such as the purchase of books, the addition of equipment, and the provision of school supplies, all of which are readily available. The exhibits displayed before the audience today are also quite impressive.</p>
<p>Regarding Staff and Students: At the beginning of the school year in the fourteenth year, there was only one class each in junior high and elementary school, with only forty students. The following year, one class was added to each department, and the number of students doubled. The year after that, senior high school was added, and the number of students increased even more. The school's grade levels were thus completed. From then on, the number of students entering the school increased year by year, reaching more than four hundred today. The number of teachers has increased from five or six to more than thirty, all of whom are graduates of specialized universities at home and abroad, enthusiastic about guidance and dedicated to teaching. All of the past staff members have been experienced, dedicated to their duties, and striving for the improvement of school affairs. Therefore, they have been able to cooperate, pool their wisdom and efforts, and jointly seek development, laying the foundation for today.</p>
<p>Regarding Student Achievements: The school's moral education has always been committed to cultivating a pure and simple academic style and developing a spirit of hard work. The school's policy is to carefully examine students' academic performance and to be particularly strict with their annual examinations, so the students are pure in character and excellent in academic achievement. They have won championships in city-wide speeches many times, and have also achieved excellent results in joint examinations. It is estimated that more than 40% of the graduates have been admitted to famous universities in China, and 50% are serving the community. All of this is statistically verifiable, and it is not difficult to find their names on the lists, so it has attracted the attention of people from all walks of life, who have praised it. How could we dare to expect such success?</p>
<p>Regarding Future Plans: Women's education in China has been established for more than forty years, and it has produced many talents. However, family life has not improved, and social customs are becoming increasingly decadent, causing the entire nation to be in a state of turmoil and unable to recover! Although there are many reasons for this, the inadequacy of the education system is an obvious fact. Scholars of the present age seek to revitalize the nation, so they advocate for productive education and seek immediate solutions, because future women must obtain correct knowledge and sound skills from education so that they can work together with men in social production and promote national economic development. In view of this, the school added a senior high school normal school class in the eighteenth year; four years later, a business class was added. Now that the normal school class should be returned to national conditions, it has been concluded; and the three-year business class has been completed. In the future, we plan to gradually expand agricultural and industrial vocational courses to the best of our ability, with the aim of creating productive talents for social application. This is the goal that we are aiming for in the future.</p>
<p>In summary, the school has established a relatively complete scale in a limited period of ten years. This is the result of the faculty and staff sacrificing their mental and physical strength and working diligently. Only then have we been able to receive social praise and assistance. Therefore, in the sixteenth year, the school board approved the registration with the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, and in the same year, it was approved for record by the Ministry of Education. The inspectors who have visited the school have found it satisfactory. In addition to the joy and encouragement on the anniversary, we must also think about how to strive for progress and contribute to society. As for the school's administrative organization and the curriculum of each level, they are all handled in accordance with the Ministry of Education's regulations, so we will omit them. We have described the major aspects of management in such detail.</p>

<h3 id="e213">School Overview and Future Plans <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>The mission of a school is to teach and educate; the function of education is to continuously provide appropriate training according to the developmental stages of students' physical and mental development, to enlighten their moral and intellectual aspects, and to meet the needs of their living environment. Our school has been established for ten years. Although there have been eight hundred graduates, how much have we actually achieved in this function during the past ten years? We cannot know for sure, and we dare not be complacent. As the Book of Rites says, "The plumb line and ink are clearly laid out, and cannot be deceived with curves and straights." The reality of teaching and moral education is the school's plumb line and ink. We sincerely present the outline of these two aspects below, and attach our future improvement plans at the end, hoping that the gentlemen of the country will take a look.</p>

<p>Shanghai Peiming Girls' Middle School Tenth Anniversary</p>
<h3 id="e214">(A) Academics <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>1.  Organization of Grade Levels</p>
<p>The school is divided into three departments: senior high, junior high, and elementary school. The senior high is further divided into business and general studies. There are three classes in junior high. The senior high business and general studies each have three grades, for a total of nine middle school classes. The elementary school has six grades and four classrooms. The junior high aims to suit the individual's profession and cultivate the level to enter senior high school. The senior high general studies focuses on entering university undergraduate programs. The business studies focuses on studying economic principles and cultivating practical commercial talents. The elementary school aims to cultivate good citizens and engage in primary occupations and enter junior high school.</p>
<p>2.  Course Arrangement</p>
<p>The course arrangements for the junior high, senior high general studies, and elementary school at all levels all follow the Ministry of Education's curriculum standards for primary and secondary schools. As for the business course standards, the Ministry of Education has not yet stipulated them, so the school's business courses are mostly compiled and edited with reference to the courses offered by famous business schools in Shanghai.</p>
<p>3.  Textbook Selection</p>
<p>The textbooks used in each grade, except for a part of the business courses and art courses that are edited by the school, are mostly textbooks approved by the Ministry of Education. However, when selecting textbooks, we try our best to ensure the connection and coordination of each subject and the improvement of teaching effectiveness. At the beginning and end of each semester, the academic affairs office must discuss with the teachers several times before making a decision.</p>
<p>4.  Review of Homework</p>
<p>In addition to paying attention to lectures and exercises in class, the school also strictly reviews homework for each department and subject. Precise plans are made for each subject in advance. When the time comes to collect and review, there is no leniency. For example, the homework for the Chinese language subject includes four types: reading notes, composition notebooks, diaries, and calligraphy practice books. English, mathematics, science, business arithmetic, bookkeeping, and other subjects all have practice books. Moreover, the commercial subjects all have notebooks for review.</p>
<p>5.  Performance Assessment</p>
<p>The school assesses student academic performance by combining three items: daily grades, monthly exams, and semester exams to determine the semester grade. Daily grades are based on the quality of the student's answers, exercises, and homework during class, as well as the quality of the production. The monthly exam time is designated by the academic affairs office to start and end within a certain week, and is held during class time. As for the semester exam at the end of the semester, the academic affairs office schedules the dates, assigns numbers, and conducts a comprehensive test of all the materials taught in a semester.</p>
<p>6.  Self-Study Guidance</p>
<p>Every evening except Saturday, there are two hours of self-study, supervised and guided by the class teachers in each classroom. Important teachers of each subject are also invited to stay overnight at the school to facilitate students' inquiries at any time.</p>
<p>7.  Attendance Statistics</p>
<p>In order to assess the progress of student performance, the school attaches great importance to the method of collecting student attendance statistics. Every day, the teachers in charge of the class take attendance every period, and report the names of absent students to the class teachers after class. At the end of each week, the academic affairs office uses this to fill out a form to compare the diligence of each grade. Students with excessive absences are given counseling or punishment at any time.</p>
<p>8.  Speech Training</p>
<p>The school attaches great importance to public speaking. Every other week, prominent figures from society are invited to the school to give speeches for observation. Every other week, a speech contest is held, with several people drawn by lot each time. They practice in advance, and the two or three winners are determined at the time. At the end of each semester, a final competition is held. Therefore, students who have been at the school for half a year can speak Mandarin and express their opinions to the public. They have also won various important speech competitions in Shanghai, and have been praised by people in Shanghai.</p>
<p>9.  Importance of Current Events</p>
<p>In order to encourage students to pay attention to reading newspapers and closely follow international news and national administration, each week the class teachers take turns explaining the main points and significance of the week's important current events during the memorial week. A current events test is held once each semester, divided by grade, with grades calculated proportionally.</p>
<p>10. Literary Gathering</p>
<p>Since the 20th year, the school has held a literary gathering once each semester. The Chinese language teachers in the school first propose a topic each in advance. One hour before the literary gathering, a temporary meeting is held to decide on the topic. The papers are graded by the Chinese language teachers, and five people are selected from each grade. Then, five more names are selected from the preliminary exam papers. So far, the interest has been very high.</p>

<h3 id="e220">(B) Moral Education <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>Middle school female students are in their youth, the golden age of life. At this time, their physical development is rapid, their reasoning increases, their emotions are stirred, their social impulses are strong, and their self-expression reaches its peak. It is imperative to pay attention to their natural interests and give them opportunities for balanced development, preventing dangerous tendencies. However, how to guide them according to circumstances, how to prevent problems before they arise, and how to correct them afterward are all difficult tasks. Therefore, moral education is the most challenging issue. The moral education at our school is the shared responsibility of a large number of faculty and staff, with the director of moral education overseeing it. Furthermore, we collaborate with students to cultivate "independent and self-governing students who build themselves."</p>
<p>(1) Standards of Moral Education—The school's training program focuses on the four aspects of moral, intellectual, physical, and social development, and also considers the needs of the times, setting six major goals aimed at promoting the inherent virtues of our nation: loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, and peace. These are listed below:</p>
<p>1.  Vigorously abandon cowardice and complacency, and cultivate a spirit of courage and striving.</p>
<p>2.  Vigorously abandon reliance and perfunctoriness, and cultivate the ability to be independent and responsible.</p>
<p>3.  Vigorously abandon rashness and blind obedience, and cultivate careful and thorough thinking.</p>
<p>4.  Vigorously abandon romantic extravagance, and cultivate habits of diligence and thrift.</p>
<p>5.  Vigorously abandon hypocrisy and disunity, and cultivate a spirit of sincerity and solidarity.</p>
<p>6.  Vigorously abandon selfishness and self-interest, and cultivate a concept of loving the country and loving the family.</p>
<p>(2) Examination of Conduct Grades</p>
<p>The examination of students' conduct grades is the responsibility of all faculty and staff members in addition to the moral education personnel. Based on the set goals, they observe students' daily activities at all times and in all places. Any factual manifestations in terms of personality, temperament, and behavior are recorded separately in the conduct examination book. At the end of the semester, these are compiled, assessed for merit, and reported to parents. If there are any instances of poor behavior or disciplinary violations, they are recorded in the conduct book and parents are notified immediately for mutual admonishment to improve the situation.</p>
<p>(3) Regulations for Rewards and Punishments</p>
<p>The school's various competitions, such as speeches and tests, emphasize group awards in order to inspire a spirit of cooperation and eliminate selfish notions. However, individual students who are ethical, studious, helpful, and diligent are still rewarded. The rewards are generally divided into certificates and scholarships. Students who have particularly good academic, conduct, and physical education performance after evaluation are given scholarships. In addition, certificates are given to those who pass all courses, have good conduct, and have no long-term absences.</p>
<p>Punishments are divided into admonishment, demerits, and expulsion. Students who commit violations or fail to work hard at their studies will be admonished to make them aware of their mistakes. A slightly more serious offense will result in a demerit as a warning. The most serious offenses will result in expulsion. The main items are as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Those with bad character.</p>
<p>2.  Those with unsound physical or mental health or suffering from infectious diseases.</p>
<p>3.  Those who repeatedly fail to reform after being punished.</p>
<p>4.  Those who evade semester exams.</p>
<p>5.  Those who cheat on exams.</p>
<p>6.  Those who insult teachers.</p>
<p>7.  Those who seriously violate school rules.</p>
<p>8.  Those whose improper behavior damages the school's reputation.</p>
<p>(4) Implementation of Moral Education—Based on the spirit of the Three Principles of the People and the principle of teacher-student cooperation, we aim to systematize thinking, discipline behavior, and cultivate students into sound citizens, with a focus on proactive guidance.</p>
<p>(A) The following aspects of the proactive approach are noteworthy:</p>
<p>1.  Establish Class Tutors—The school's tutors are based on grade level, guiding the extracurricular activities and grade meetings of each grade level to develop self-governance abilities. They sometimes instill principles of conduct and self-cultivation to cultivate useful talents.</p>
<p>2.  Establish Grade Meetings—The school drafts simple regulations for the organization of grade meetings. Under the guidance of the tutors, grade meetings are established for each grade level. Each grade meeting elects seven officers to be responsible for general affairs, academics, recreation, and physical education. Regular meetings are held every Monday afternoon after 4:00 PM to discuss ongoing matters, and inter-grade social gatherings are held in rotation each month to connect the students of each grade and provide entertainment.</p>
<p>3.  Vigorously Implement Morning Exercises—The purpose of morning exercises is to exercise the body and cultivate the habit of waking up early. They are held every morning before breakfast. When students are on the field, in addition to being guided by physical education teachers, they are also monitored by moral education personnel and grade tutors for evaluation.</p>
<p>4.  Conduct Individual and Group Talks—In order to foster harmonious relationships between teachers and students and to eliminate any distance between students and the school, it is essential to hold individual talks with students. When students' thoughts and behaviors are inappropriate, they are earnestly advised to correct them. Students who are suffering or have concerns can use the talks to express them. Individual talks are very effective. Group talks are often conducted by the principal, tutors, and moral education personnel, while school-wide talks are held during memorial weeks.</p>
<p>5.  Publish Wall Newspapers—These wall newspapers are written entirely by students of each grade, thereby cultivating students' ability to express themselves. Each grade publishes them once every two weeks. The content is roughly divided into forums, current events, science, and literature. Particular emphasis is placed on academic exploration and the recording of current events. The results have been quite remarkable.</p>
<p>6.  Hold Teacher-Student Gatherings—The school holds teacher-student social gatherings once or twice each semester. Students from each grade prepare programs, and teachers also act and participate in performances. Everyone enjoys themselves to the fullest and disperses happily. The next day, classes are still held as usual without any signs of fatigue, as the excitement greatly enhances their spirits.</p>
<p>7.  Organize Thrift and National Salvation Groups—At a time when the economy is depleted and the nation is facing severe difficulties, students, as intellectuals, should practice frugality in clothing and food to fulfill their duty of loving the country. Therefore, thrift and national salvation groups have been established. The purpose is to ensure that all students practice not being extravagant, not decorating excessively, and not using foreign goods. The method is to publicly discuss and agree on regulations, which are implemented by the person in charge of the national groups, and to formulate reward and punishment measures. Students are generally able to comply. This spirit and action mark a new era for Shanghai girls' schools.</p>
<p>(B) Management Aspects</p>
<p>1.  Strictly Prohibit Unauthorized Departure from School—The urban society is a breeding ground for all evils, and young people with weak wills are most prone to fall into depravity if they set foot in it. Therefore, management must be strict. The school conducts roll calls once or twice every night after boarding students return to their dormitories from self-study. Those who are found to have left without authorized leave are expelled immediately.</p>
<p>2.  Inspect the Cleanliness of Dormitories and Classrooms—The cleanliness of dormitories and classrooms is not only related to the school's appearance but also to public health. In addition to regular major cleanings every week, the school also conducts daily cleanliness inspections. Statistics are compiled weekly, and the most outstanding results are awarded a cleanliness flag as encouragement.</p>
<p>3.  Establish Leave Procedures—Taking leave is most likely to neglect studies. Students are not allowed to take leave unless they have illnesses or unavoidable circumstances. The leave procedures are divided into regular leave and class leave. Regular leave is for those who do not miss classes, and it is allowed once a week per person. Those who take leave to leave the school after classes on Saturday afternoons or on Sundays must return to school before 6:00 PM. If their families are in the local area, they must obtain a stay-out permit upon the formal request of their parents. For class leave, parents must send a letter to the moral education office stating the reason for the leave to be valid. In the case of sick leave, it must be certified by the school doctor to be approved.</p>
<p>(C) Future Plans</p>
<p>Anyone engaged in any work, if they want to achieve considerable results, how can they not work diligently and advance with the times? Only then will there be evidence of its fruit. All things are like this, how can education be an exception? Yue Zhang, who manages this school, has gone through six years. Although I have received advice from government officials, social elders, and school board members, I have fortunately avoided failure. However, at this tenth anniversary, it is important to be frugal and curb past shortcomings. We will formulate improvement plans in both material and spiritual aspects, in order to align with the direction of great governance.</p>
<p>A. Material Aspects</p>
<p>Constructing School Buildings: The school's buildings are rented, costing ten thousand yuan annually, which is not economical. Moreover, the impact on moral education and academic affairs is not insignificant. Yue Zhang has not forgotten this idea. In the past, the school board resolved to raise funds for construction. We have received letters from enthusiastic educators, stating that the fundraising has been somewhat successful. Once the funds are collected, we will purchase land and hire workers to start construction, obtaining permanent buildings so that the faculty can teach and students can study and play. This wish may be partially fulfilled.</p>
<p>(2) Increasing Equipment</p>
<p>1. Filling the Library: Students rely solely on textbooks to study at school. How much can they gain? Providing a library with a rich collection of books cannot be delayed. The school's old library has about nine thousand volumes, including classics, famous works in various subjects, and contemporary magazines. In the future, we plan to save on regular expenses and purchase two thousand books each semester to provide for the students.</p>
<p>2. Adding Laboratories: The importance of scientific experiments goes without saying. In the past, due to the insufficient school buildings, laboratories were still lacking. After the new school buildings are completed, we should first add a physics and chemistry laboratory and a botany and zoology laboratory for full research.</p>
<p>3. Equipment for Physical Education, Arts, and Business: For physical education, we plan to increase the equipment for the Boy Scouts and purchase sports equipment. The art department will establish a specialized classroom and purchase more models, etc. The number of business students is increasing daily, and the existing typewriters are insufficient. We must purchase more and set up a bank and consumer cooperative for their practice.</p>
<p>B. Spiritual Aspects</p>
<p>(1) Reforming Administrative Organization</p>
<p>1. Unifying Authority: School administration is a unified entity, divided into various departments. The relationship between them is very close. Their spirits are harmonious and inseparable, their duties are divided and have boundaries, and the result is that the administrative center is their common goal, and then the effect of command can be achieved. In the past, the school's organization sometimes lacked thorough consideration, which affected administrative efficiency. In the future, we will revise the regulations for administrative affairs, documents, academic affairs, moral education, and other departments, so as to achieve the effect of unifying authority.</p>
<p>2. Communicating the Spirit of Moral Education: In recent schools, moral education and teaching have been separate, and those in charge have become accustomed to viewing moral education and teaching as two separate things. Those being taught also divide character and learning into two separate things. Cultivating in this way is difficult to achieve good results. School authorities examine past mistakes, and there is the implementation of the unification of moral education. We combine the two departments of academic affairs and moral education and place one director of guidance. The school has also tried this system, and the past mistakes, it is said, have not been remedied. However, adding the responsibilities of the entire school's moral education to one person, considering this and that, how much energy is there? Yue Zhang believes that the unification of moral education is not in the nominal correction, but in the integration of the spirit and methods in implementation. If we constantly think of moral education as teaching and teaching as moral education, we can avoid the hard work of affairs and gain the meaning of the unification of moral education. My humble opinion is to ask for wisdom.</p>
<p>3. Common Life: The lifestyle habits of faculty and staff are models for students in everything, which is called setting a good example. If they are not careful about diet and living, students will be influenced invisibly and reduce the effectiveness of education a lot. It is recorded, "The one who starts driving a horse, reverses it, the cart is in front of the horse," is this what it means? In the near future, teachers and students will practice a common life, and all aspects of clothing, diet, and recreation will be simple and plain with students.</p>
<p>4. Adding Classes: The school is divided into three departments: elementary school, junior high school, and senior high school. The senior high school is divided into general studies, business studies, and teacher training (now ordered to end), a total of thirteen classes. This winter vacation, the junior high school and senior high school will add one freshman class each, and the elementary school will add a kindergarten to expand.</p>
<p>(2) Implementing Career Guidance</p>
<p>1. Set up a Career Guidance Department: In addition to the administrative, academic, and moral education departments, we will add a career guidance department to provide organized and systematic guidance.</p>
<p>2. Specially Set Up Career Lectures: We will hire career education experts to give lectures at the school every week, so that students can acquire advanced knowledge of careers and the path to engaging in careers.</p>
<p>3. Career Introduction: We will earnestly contact the business community so that the school can do its best to introduce students after graduation.</p>
<p>(3) Expanding the School's Educational Functions</p>
<p>1. Connecting Families: Families and schools are closely related. The school must clearly understand students' living habits at home and the family environment. The family should also know the students' life situation at school. In this way, the school has a guideline for the individual training of students, and what the family expects from the school is also easy to handle. Moreover, as parents have more opportunities to contact teachers, the relationship becomes more and more cordial. Intercommunication has an invisible effect on education that is not small.</p>
<p>2. Communicating with Society: "Closing the door to build a car, going out the door may not fit the track," educators also say "school is society" and "education is life." Based on the above, schools and society should strive to communicate in order to become one.</p>
<p>3. Holding Civil Schools: School education and social education have the responsibility to depend on each other and help each other. Within the possible range of schools, such as people's schools, reading newspapers, and writing on behalf of others, should be attached to make up for the deficiencies of social education. The school plans to run an attached civil school in each semester to reduce social illiteracy. All aspects of the school need to be improved at all times. The above is just a general overview. The advancement of any career, the economy is its driving force. In the future, Yue Zhang will see how the school's financial resources are, and weigh the urgency of the matter, seek truth from facts, and strive for gradual perfection, so that students can improve both physically and mentally. As for personal talent, I know that I am inadequate, and I hope that there are outstanding people who can teach me.</p>

<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>It is noted that long-distance telephone calls in various European and American countries are all based on a three-minute system. The Ministry of Communications-operated long-distance telephone services in various provinces also adopt the three-minute system as a principle, with some using a five-minute system during the initial establishment period. In December of last year, price standards for three-minute and five-minute systems were stipulated based on actual distances to standardize them. Currently, domestic long-distance telephone equipment has reached a considerable level of development, and international wireless telephone services are scheduled to be implemented. In order to meet international call standards and facilitate future international calls, the Ministry of Communications has decided to adopt the three-minute system nationwide, starting from April, according to spatial distance as the standard. This is the reason for the Ministry of Communications' revision of long-distance telephone prices.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, some users on the Beijing-Shanghai line have expressed dissatisfaction after the implementation of these prices. My friend Mr. Wu wrote to me, raising three points for discussion regarding this matter: (1) Each call between the two locations is not clear, and repeated explanations are needed. Due to dialect differences, it is practically impossible to complete the call within three minutes. (2) In the past, a five-minute call between Beijing and Shanghai cost one unit at $1.50. Now, a four-minute call costs $2.40, an increase of 60%! (3) According to the government's decree, for any monopolistic or franchised enterprise, whether government-run, commercially-run, or jointly-run, if it intends to increase the burden on the people due to excessive expenses, it must first have the principles determined by the Central Political Conference and then submitted to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation, unless otherwise stipulated by law; otherwise, it is considered illegal. You are familiar with the transportation industry, so can you enlighten me on this matter? Mr. Wu's words have some merit. Upon further study, the following questions arise: (1) Is three minutes sufficient for a call? (2) Does the three-minute system increase the price by 60%? (3) Is the Ministry of Communications' revision of long-distance call prices illegal?</p>
<p>To facilitate communication for the public, the Ministry of Communications has revised various telegram fees, resulting in an annual loss of about $500,000. Furthermore, the express call fee for long-distance calls, which was originally three times the regular fee, was reduced to two times the regular fee in October of last year, resulting in an annual loss of over $100,000. These facts are evident and visible to all. To say that this revision of long-distance call prices is intentionally increasing the burden on the public is hardly fair. After the author obtained the truth, I responded to the questions as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Three Minutes is Sufficient for a Call: The so-called three-minute system is defined as three minutes from the time the receiver answers the call to the time they indicate the end of the call. Within this time limit is the first call, and beyond this is the second call. Continuous calls must not exceed two calls. According to experts, those who use long-distance telephones are usually dealing with urgent and simple matters that can be resolved with a few words. Three minutes is sufficient and there is no need to ramble on and require five minutes. If a matter cannot be resolved within three minutes, one can use the telephone telegram service instead of relying on long-distance calls. As for the issue of unclear sound quality, it is a technical problem and has nothing to do with time. Even if the competent authority stipulates a call time of ten minutes, it will be useless. After all, one can communicate as if face-to-face even across vast oceans. How can it be that communication between Beijing and Shanghai, which are so close, cannot flow smoothly?</p>
<p>(2) Call Prices Have Not Increased by 60%: To make the comparison clearer, I have transcribed the two sets of standard prices issued by the Ministry of Communications as follows:</p>
<p>Three-Minute System</p>
<p>Distance in Kilometers (Spatial Distance) Price (Silver Dollars)</p>
<p>0-20 0.10</p>
<p>20-40 0.20</p>
<p>40-60 0.30</p>
<p>60-80 0.40</p>
<p>80-100 0.50</p>
<p>100-125 0.60</p>
<p>125-150 0.70</p>
<p>150-175 0.80</p>
<p>175-200 0.90</p>
<p>200-225 1.00</p>
<p>225-250 1.10</p>
<p>250-275 1.20</p>
<p>275-300 1.30</p>
<p>Five-Minute System</p>
<p>Distance in Kilometers (Spatial Distance) Price (Silver Dollars)</p>
<p>0-15 0.10</p>
<p>15-30 0.20</p>
<p>30-45 0.30</p>
<p>45-60 0.40</p>
<p>60-75 0.50</p>
<p>75-90 0.60</p>
<p>90-110 0.70</p>
<p>110-130 0.80</p>
<p>130-150 0.90</p>
<p>150-170 1.00</p>
<p>170-190 1.10</p>
<p>190-210 1.20</p>
<p>210-230 1.30</p>
<p>Looking at the above table, in terms of the minimum distance, the three-minute system is for 20 kilometers, which is 5 kilometers more than the 15 kilometers for the five-minute system. In terms of the same call cost, with a fee of $1.30, the three-minute system can cover 300 kilometers, while the five-minute system can only cover 230 kilometers. The spatial distance between Beijing and Shanghai is about 270 kilometers, so the stipulated price is $1.20, which is $0.30 less than the original five-minute system. If we consider two calls totaling six minutes, the three-minute system charges $2.40, while the five-minute system charges $3.00. For the same six minutes, the three-minute system is actually 20% cheaper. Furthermore, there is a difference between spatial distance and line distance. The line has many bends due to engineering reasons, while spatial distance forms a straight line between the two points. Compared to each other, the difference is about 20%. In the past, distance was calculated based on the line, but now it is based on spatial standards. This loss is another 20%!</p>
<p>In terms of the price on the Beijing-Shanghai line, the original price was based on a three-minute calculation when the Beijing government first opened the Shanghai telephone exchange. Later, the call time was temporarily changed to five minutes for one call, but the price was not increased. Later, as the line extended to various places, call prices were still calculated according to the previously determined ratio, resulting in lower call prices on the Beijing-Shanghai line compared to other lines nationwide. Now, the Ministry of Communications has reduced the original three-minute system price—$1.50—to the current price—$1.20—for fees. There seems to be nothing wrong with this for the convenience of public communication.</p>
<p>It is noted that long-distance calls between Beijing and Tianjin are based on a three-minute system, which has been in effect for years. The distance between Beijing and Tianjin is 112 kilometers, and the price is set at $0.60, which is convenient for the public. It is also noted that the five-minute system for long-distance telephones in various parts of the country has been gradually changed to the three-minute system since April 1st of this year, and no objections have been heard. Now, the distance between Beijing and Shanghai is 270 kilometers, and the three-minute system is implemented, with a reduced price of $1.20. What difficulties do users still feel?</p>
<p>(3) Is the Ministry of Communications' Revision of Telephone Prices Illegal? I am not a legal expert and therefore cannot answer this question. However, I have heard that the Ministry of Communications' revisions to telegram and telephone prices over the years, revisions to postal and shipping prices, and the Ministry of Railways' revisions to transportation prices on various routes do not seem to have been reviewed by the Legislative Yuan. People in society have also not considered them illegal. Should the transportation services operated by the Ministry of Communications be compared with ordinary government-run enterprises? Is there already a legal basis for the Ministry of Communications' revision of telegram and telephone prices? If you ask the transportation authorities, I believe they will have a clear answer.</p>
<p>In summary, the Ministry of Communications' current regulations on long-distance telephone prices are aimed at adopting the current international system for communication with international individuals and taking into account the national economic situation to cooperate with individuals in society. It is definitely not comparable to those who disregard the interests of the people for the purpose of profit. At the same time, if users have any opinions, the Ministry of Communications will sincerely communicate with them and accept them as much as possible within the scope of possibility. You are a leader and are admired by all. I hope you can provide more guidance to dispel the confusion of the general public. Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu heard this and said: "Good! Write 'Answering Questions About the Three-Minute System'."</p>
<h3 id="e239">The Benefits of Installing a Telephone <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Ming</p>
<p>In the previous issue of this publication, the article "Comparison of Telegraph and Long-Distance Telephone" written by Mr. Qinghua provided an extremely detailed analysis of the benefits of telegrams and telephones, giving the public a very clear understanding of the differences between long-distance telephones and telegrams. This allows people to determine when it is appropriate to make a phone call or send a telegram. However, what Mr. Qinghua presented was only a comparison of the benefits of telegrams and telephones, and not simply a lecture on the efficacy of telegrams or telephones. This publication has repeatedly recorded the efficacy of telegrams, and it can be said that it has been fully elaborated. As for telephones, there has been little clear description.</p>
<p>When it comes to the efficacy of telephones, it can be said to be an inexhaustible subject, difficult to express in a single sentence. To describe the efficacy of telephones, I think it is best to use the sentence that Jiufu Company used to describe its own medicine called "Bailingji", which is "Unexpected efficacy!" These eight characters are really true. The various effects of telephones, when talked about, are indeed superficial, but ordinary people often neglect them because they are superficial, resulting in many indirect or direct losses of benefits and opportunities, or needlessly spending a lot of energy, time and money!</p>
<p>Having said that, I might as well give a simple example: Last summer, the weather was extremely hot, and the indoor temperature was often around ninety-seven or eighty degrees, sometimes even exceeding one hundred degrees. Therefore, ice shops were everywhere in the capital city. As usual, in such hot weather, doing such a timely business should have been thriving. However, the fact was not so, because there were too many ice shops, and the supply exceeded the demand, so there was not much profit to be made. However, a few of them did do some business. They did not rely solely on retail sales, but their main transactions were in the delivery of whole buckets of ice cream. It turned out that these few had foresight and were different from the others, and they all had telephones installed in their stores. Many people in government offices, public residences, and shops wanted to drink ice to relieve the heat when they were busy with work and sweating like rain. If they asked servants or went to buy it themselves, it would be uneconomical in terms of time, and who would be willing to run under the scorching sun? So they all chose these few shops with telephones to call for delivery. When the ice shops received a call, they immediately sent someone to ride a bicycle with ice cream and rush over, arriving in a moment. How satisfied the customers were! No wonder the business was thriving!</p>
<p>The above example has shown the efficacy of telephones clearly. Ice shops gained a lot of business because they had telephones installed, which is a benefit; because they had telephones installed, people could find them or they could attract people's love, which is an opportunity; as for telephone users, they can leisurely lie on the sofa, lightly dial the phone, and order ice cream to drink, which saves money, time and energy, and is also so comfortable. The principle of this example can be extended to all kinds of businesses, and is applicable to anyone. In other words, telephones have the efficacy of helping all undertakings to develop.</p>
<p>However, the efficacy of telephones is not limited to this. They also have the efficacy of providing quick access to news, familiarity with market conditions, assisting public security, enhancing friendship, breaking loneliness, and rescuing emergencies. Whether you are in business or politics, you must have quick access to news. If you have a telephone, news will be easily transmitted, either reporting to others or inquiring from others. As for people in business, in particular, they need to be familiar with market conditions in order to buy and sell. If they do not use the telephone and rely on running around on their own feet, it will not only be laborious and time-consuming, but also the market conditions they obtain will be limited. Speaking of assisting public security, telephones can especially exert great efficacy. For example, if a fire or robbery occurs somewhere, you can use the power of the telephone to immediately notify the news to the fire prevention agency to arrive at the scene to rescue and reduce the damage, or the public security agency to send police to arrest the bandits. Also, if one or two close friends are in the south or north of the city, and they have been separated for a long time and miss each other, but personally visiting each other is too far and time-consuming, and they are especially afraid of not being able to meet, at this time they can chat with him on the phone and express their feelings, or make an appointment to meet in person. The telephone should be given the first credit for enhancing the friendship between the two parties. Also, when we are bored, we can also use the telephone to find a friend to talk to, thereby breaking the loneliness and giving comfort. As for emergencies such as sudden acute illnesses or a pregnant woman giving birth in the middle of the night, the telephone is the most precious thing for people. The efficacy of telephones is endless and unimaginable. It is most appropriate to describe it with the four words "Unexpected!".</p>
<p>There is one more thing I would like to talk to you about here. The telephone bureaus in Shanghai, Tianjin, Beiping, Wuhan, Qingdao, the Capital, Wuxian, Zhenjiang, Yantai, etc., which are under the Ministry of Communications, all have inquiry desks, which not only answer public inquiries about telephone numbers, but also answer user inquiries about various local affairs, free of charge. This scope includes: (1) Standard time; (2) Location of the fire that occurred on the day; (3) Daily business hours of post offices and telegraph offices; (4) Locations and prices of domestic and international telegrams; (5) Locations and postage rates for domestic and international mail; (6) Daily programs and times of various entertainment venues; (7) Departure times and prices of trains, ships, and long-distance buses; (8) Telephone rental fees in the city and locations and prices of long-distance telephone calls. This measure has been implemented since April 1 this year and has been highly praised by the public. Therefore, telephone users in major ports, in addition to enjoying various benefits, are in effect hiring a loyal personnel consultant.</p>

<h3 id="e241">The Shanghai Telegraph Bureau's Contribution to the National Games <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Zhen</p>
<p>Establishing a temporary telegraph office to send and receive telegrams and sell telephones</p>
<p>The National Games is a very important event for the future of sports in our country and can attract the attention of the entire nation. Previous events held in Hangzhou, Nanjing, and other places were all extremely grand. In order to promote sports and facilitate news, the Ministry of Communications has repeatedly ordered the postal administrations and telegraph offices in Hangzhou, Nanjing, and other places to set up temporary postal and telegraph offices at the venues during the Games, which have been very successful and have won high praise from the society. The 6th National Games will open in Shanghai on National Day this year. At that time, there will be a grand scene of bustling traffic on the roads in the city center. It is reported that the Ministry of Communications has already ordered the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau to follow the precedent and set up a temporary telegraph office in the city center venue, which will open at the same time as the Games.</p>
<p>The main task of the temporary telegraph office is to transmit telegrams reporting the results of the Games. In order to ensure rapid transmission, Webster telegraph machines or Creed telegraph machines will be installed in the temporary telegraph office. On the one hand, efforts will be made to free up telegraph lines to prepare for opening direct connections to various places, so that some of the telegrams sent from the temporary telegraph office do not have to be scanned and transferred through the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, in order to be fast. On the other hand, the Games will be specially allowed to send hard news telegrams reporting the results of the Games on account, so that the Games can send news of the Games to newspapers in various places at any time, so that the people in other places who cannot attend the Games can also learn about the results of the Games in the newspaper the next day. At the same time, the temporary telegraph office is equipped with public telephones and sells local and long-distance telephones to facilitate communication. It can be seen that the establishment of the temporary telegraph office is entirely to support the Games in transmitting news of the Games and is by no means for profit.</p>
<p>When the last National Games was held in Beijing, in order to give preferential treatment to athletes from various provinces and cities in sending telegrams, the Ministry of Communications specially formulated a preferential treatment method for athletes from the National Games to send telegrams, which was printed together with the domestic social telegram rules and distributed to the athletes at the Games. This year's Games is the same. The Ministry of Communications has ordered the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau to follow the above-mentioned preferential treatment method for athletes to send telegrams. According to the provisions of the method, the Chinese and English coded telegrams sent by the athletes themselves reporting their whereabouts, daily life, and sports news can be paid according to the price of domestic social telegrams (ie, 2 cents per Chinese character and 4 cents per English character), but they are still listed as ordinary telegrams for transmission and are delivered as soon as they arrive (according to the regulations, social telegrams that arrive at the receiving telegraph office after 9 pm on the day and before 8 am the next morning should be delivered after 8 am the next day. However, the reduced-price telegrams sent by athletes are still delivered as soon as they arrive according to the ordinary telegram rules), which can be said to be a special treatment. The male and female athletes of the Games have come from afar from various provinces and cities. Although they are only separated from their parents, brothers, and sisters in their hometowns, they cannot help but miss them. Now that there is an opportunity to send telegrams at a low price, they can send telegrams to comfort them at any time. Thousands of miles away, it is like talking in the same room. The athletes can relieve their worries, work hard in sports, and win the championship.</p>
<p>In addition, the scope of the text of domestic social telegrams has been expanded. Telegrams celebrating "victory" can also be sent as social telegrams. If the family members or relatives and friends of the athletes receive a telegram informing them of the victory in a certain sport, or learn of the victory from the newspaper, they can send social telegrams to express their congratulations and encourage them. After receiving congratulatory telegrams, the athletes will inevitably be more excited, and therefore the competition results will break the national record.</p>
<p>In order to implement the policy of joint postal and telegraph services, the Ministry of Communications has ordered the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau to consult with the Shanghai Postal Administration to set up a temporary post office and telegraph office in the same place, in order to set an example for joint postal and telegraph services and facilitate public communication. Now that the opening of the Games is not far away, the above-mentioned temporary joint postal and telegraph office will soon meet the public.</p>
<h3 id="e242">Shanghai Telegraph Bureau's Review of the Purchase of the Qianliangmiao Base <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telegraph Bureau recently purchased 300 mu of land at Qianliangmiao Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, south of Beichangqiao Town, in order to expand its transmitting radio station. The Ministry of Interior announced the purchase, which caused misunderstandings among some local people, who repeatedly appealed to the Yuan and Ministry to withdraw the order. Various newspapers have also repeatedly reported on this. This article reports that the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau's purchase of the base this time is of great importance to the development of telecommunications and transportation. In order to dispel the doubts of people in the society, the true situation of the process is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai is a world commercial port and the hub of our country's foreign trade. Therefore, telegraph communication is extremely busy. Since the invention of short-wave radio, due to business and technical reasons, it has become the center of the domestic radio communication network. In the 20th year of the Republic of China, the former Shanghai Radio General Station was unable to cope with the busy business and the original manual transceivers. It had long planned to improve the equipment to facilitate communication, but at that time, the transmitting radio station was cramped in the Shangdeng Middle School in Lujiabang and could not be expanded. Moreover, since the school building was repeatedly discussed for relocation, radio communication was in danger of being interrupted from time to time. Therefore, for the sake of permanent solution, it was approved by the Ministry of Communications to purchase 200 mu of land in Qianliangmiao for the construction of a transmitting station. At that time, the Ministry of Interior also issued a public announcement, and it was not heard that the local people had any opposition. Until the January 28 Incident occurred, the purchase was temporarily shelved, and the transmitting station was temporarily moved to three places: Maigen Road and Xinzha Road on Zhonghua Road to barely cope. However, each of these places was narrow and the antenna could not be expanded. Moreover, the surrounding tall buildings were towering and the radio waves were often blocked. The communication efficiency was inevitably affected. Since the merger of the bureaus last year, the telegraph business has become even more heavy, and the expansion of radio equipment is even more urgent. Therefore, the old proposal was followed and land was purchased in Qianliangmiao for construction.</p>
<p>This time, the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau purchased 300 mu of land in Qianliangmiao, which is 100 mu more than in the 20th year of the Republic of China. The reason for this is the change in the plan and also the technical needs. In order to avoid mutual feelings between the antennas, there must be sufficient distance between each payment. Approximately, each directional antenna Bodhi tree requires 6 mu of land, and non-directional antenna requires 3 mu. In addition, there are two wavelengths for day and night work, and two antennas must be prepared for each. Therefore, the planned antennas are 58 pairs, which require approximately 230 mu of land. In addition, the construction of houses and walkways and the reserved expansion space, etc., must be 50 or 60 mu. Therefore, the area of the new transmitting station base in Shanghai must be at least 300 mu, which is not an excessive requirement.</p>
<p>According to radio communication, it all depends on the transmission of radio waves, and the quality of the transmission of radio waves depends entirely on whether there are tall buildings or forests around the transmitting radio station that obstruct the range. The area north of Qianliangmiao Station is empty and boundless, which is very suitable for the above-mentioned conditions. Therefore, it is very suitable as a radio transmitting station base. Moreover, it is only about 4 kilometers away from the high-voltage transmission line laid along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway by the Huashang Electric Company in the South City. In the future, the expansion and connection will be quite convenient for the power supply. Therefore, this place was specially selected for application. In fact, the place does have various objective conditions and is not a deliberate demand for a certain place.</p>
<p>In summary, the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau's purchase of the Qianliangmiao base is a necessary move for the development of telecommunications and transportation, and there is no intention to seek profit in the area. We sincerely hope that the local people understand the importance of state-owned enterprises and will not make persistent criticisms. We especially hope that the media will provide unified support, in order to dispel the unnecessary misunderstandings of the social scholars, which is our hope.</p>
<h3 id="e243">A Brief Account of the Newly Revised Domestic Telegraph Business Regulations (Continued from the previous issue) <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Zhen</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the methods for delivering telegrams: Delivering telegrams is one of the important tasks of the telegraph office. Therefore, the telegraph office must have detailed and comprehensive regulations for delivering incoming telegrams in order to increase the speed of delivery. In view of this, the Ministry of Communications has specifically stipulated in detail the methods for delivering telegrams and the price of special effort fees in the newly revised domestic telegraph business regulations, so that each telegraph office has something to follow. The improvements compared with the old regulations are briefly listed as follows: 1. When a messenger delivers a telegram and encounters that the recipient's residence is closed or no one is willing to receive it on his behalf, he should try to leave a notice at the place and return the telegram to the office, waiting for the recipient or his representative to bring the seal to the office to collect it. If this telegram waiting to be collected is not collected after 12 hours, it should be sent again. If it is still impossible to deliver it properly, it should be handled according to the method for undeliverable telegrams and a notice should be published in the newspaper to solicit collection. (2) Telegrams sent to passengers on ships arriving at the port should be sent before the recipient disembarks as far as possible. If time does not permit, the telegrams may be sent to the manager of the ship. (3) Ordinary, urgent, or social Chinese coded telegrams should be translated into text by the telegraph office before delivery, and no translation fee will be charged. The above three rules are quite convenient for the recipients and are not the beginning of the improvement of the service spirit of the telegraph office.</p>
<p>As for the price of the special effort fee, it has been slightly increased compared with the old regulations in order to meet actual needs. However, after the price of the special effort fee has been increased, the Ministry of Communications has strictly ordered each telegraph office to strictly abide by the stipulated prices when charging fees in the future, and there must be no more cases of deliberately violating the order and arbitrarily raising prices and demanding. If the recipient encounters a messenger who extorts fees, he can detail the facts and evidence and appeal directly to the Telegraph Administration of the Ministry of Communications for strict punishment in accordance with the regulations.</p>
<h3 id="e244">How to Calculate the Number of Words in English Plain Language? <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Li</p>
<p>—Please pay attention to the senders—</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, the International Radio Station, and the Sanshui Line Telegraph Receiving and Sending Office under the International Telecommunications Bureau, in view of the fact that there is no definite standard for calculating the number of words in English telegrams, have specially drafted a "Provisional Method for Calculating the Number of Words in English Plain Language Telegrams." Now, for the convenience of the senders, it is translated into Chinese in summary and introduced here:</p>
<p>Provisional Method for Calculating the Number of Words in English Plain Language Telegrams</p>
<p>A, Words in the dictionary: (No more than fifteen letters are charged as one word)</p>
<p>(1) Compound words that are continuously connected with a hyphen can be counted as one word by removing the hyphen.</p>
<p>(2) Contractions of negative words are counted as one word, removing the apostrophe.</p>
<p>Example Don’t can be written as Dont and counted as one word</p>
<p>B, Words not in the dictionary</p>
<p>(3) Auxiliary verbs that are combined with the word not to form a contraction are counted as one word.</p>
<p>Example Must Not can be written as Mustont and counted as one word.</p>
<p>(4) Prefixes un added to a word and connected to form a word are counted as a single word according to common usage.</p>
<p>(See Webster's New International Dictionary, 1935 Edition, page 2757. New International Dictonary 1935 Edjtin Page 2757)</p>
<p>Prefixes Yester used to indicate time and added to other words to form a word are counted as one word.</p>
<p>Example Yestermonth (counted as one word)</p>
<p>(6) Cardinal numbers combined with a noun to form an adjective can be counted as one word.</p>
<p>Example 1. Sixcylinder car (counted as two words) But Sixcylinders (counted as two words)</p>
<p>Example 2. Fivedollar note (counted as two words) But Fivedollars (counted as two words)</p>
<p>(7) Artificial words that are invented with the intention of reducing telegraph fees must be counted separately according to the words.</p>
<p>Example Relet=Refer (to your) letter (counted as two words)</p>
<p>Relet=Refer (to your) telegram (counted as two words)</p>
<p>(8) The names of publications, pictures, films, companies, foreign firms, societies, organizations, etc., must be counted separately according to the words.</p>
<p>Example 1. Telegraphy and telephony (counted as three words)</p>
<p>2. Bank of Communications (counted as three words)</p>
<p>3. Four devils (counted as two words)</p>
<p>4. Young menschristianassociation (counted as four words)</p>
<p>(9) The initials of a group representing the names of famous groups and organizations are counted as follows:</p>
<p>(1) In the address (used as an abbreviated address) is counted as one word. For example, NCDN Shanghai. However, the sender is responsible for the responsibility if the delivery is unsuccessful or there is no delivery.</p>
<p>(2) In the text can be counted as one word: for example, DKK, JCJL, NCDN. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Reporter</p>
<p>I have received your letter inquiring about the receipt and sending of telegrams, and I reply as follows:</p>
<p>(1) For telegrams sent to Japan, if the text is in Chinese four-code, the name and address of the recipient can be translated into Japanese to facilitate delivery.</p>
<p>(2) Japanese telegrams (spelled with kana) sent to Japan can be received and sent by the International Radio Station, as well as the Qingdao, Sifang, and Cangkou telegraph offices.</p>
<p>(3) Only Arabic numerals can be mixed in Japanese telegrams, and each numeral is counted as a Japanese letter.</p>
<p>(4) Only accented letters are allowed in Western telegrams, and the rest are not allowed. Also, chji should be calculated as two letters.</p>
<p>(5) There are no restrictions on the text allowed for code words and cipher words. Any word composed of 26 letters can be called a code word or cipher word. Arabic numerals can also be mixed in code word or cipher word telegrams, but the number of words cannot exceed half of the total number of words in the telegram.</p>
<p>(6) Code words are composed of invented words (containing five letters), or use real words but do not contain the original meaning of the words, or are composed of a mixture of real words and invented words. For example: Klvgk Cramn is composed entirely of invented words, and Klvgk Batci Continental hotel is composed of a mixture of invented words and plain language words and are regarded as code word telegrams.</p>
<p>Any word or combination of letters that does not conform to the regulations for plain language and code words, such as the word Cramgliork, is an invented word that does not conform to the regulations for code words (because it contains more than five letters), so it should be regarded as a cipher word.</p>

<p>One clear autumn evening, clear mercury-like moonlight painted a layer of beautiful silver-gray on the four French windows near the balcony. The chilly September breeze playfully gently blew the violet-colored long window curtains. The incandescent electric light, passing through the light green lampshade, appeared bright and complemented the milky white walls, the color tone was very harmonious. Johnson sat comfortably on the sofa with the day's newspaper, Mary, quietly sat in the chair, earnestly knitting a woolen shirt, the room was shrouded in a quiet, happy, and harmonious atmosphere.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Johnson shouted as if he had discovered some miracle, "Mary! Come and see! There is good news here! Our problem can be solved."</p>
<p>Mary, who was earnestly knitting a woolen shirt, was startled by his sudden shout, and put down the woolen shirt and walked gracefully to Johnson's side, and scolded coquettishly, "What miracle did you discover! Is it worth shouting like that?"</p>
<p>Johnson said with a smile, "My love, don't be angry, come, please come and sit here, I have good things to show you!" As he said, he dragged Mary over and sat side by side on the sofa.</p>
<p>"Mary! Look, isn't this good news? Anna and Paxun are going to attend the 6th National Games? I can't think of the most agile and freshest way to encourage them to work hard and cheer them on, and celebrate their final victory. Now it's good, social telegrams can solve this problem."</p>
<p>"Yes! How good is that!" Mary looked at the newspaper and said with a smile, "It's really better than any gift. Because it's so meaningful!"</p>
<p>"Then let's send it tomorrow!" Johnson thought for a while and said, "And that day is October 10th, we can celebrate their victory on the one hand, and celebrate our National Day on the other hand, which is killing two birds with one stone!"</p>
<p>Johnson is right, social telegrams are a very good gift.</p>

<h3 id="e247">Fundraising to Establish a Bedbug Extermination Company <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Chui</p>
<p>According to news from Xin Sheng Society yesterday, several experts engaged in entomological research are currently discussing the organization of a bedbug extermination company. It is said that bedbugs are a common and special pest in the insect species, living by sucking human blood, and their reproduction is so fast that no one can cure them. They are of a global nature. Currently, all major cities in the world have traces of this pest. The British and Americans call them pests, and also call them Nanjing bugs. In fact, this bug is not produced in China. The poor and remote areas of China where transportation is inconvenient have no such bugs at all, which is clear evidence. Nanjing has gained the notoriety of this bedbug, which is really the misfortune of Nanjing and the great fortune of the bedbug.</p>
<p>It is said that the name Nanjing bug is based on a Japanese term. Japan named it after the fact that bedbugs are particularly numerous in Nanjing, China, but this is actually a mistake. The name of the bedbug as Nanjing originally came from the Treaty of Nanjing. Since the signing of the treaty, in the past hundred years, most of the people's fat and oil in our country have been absorbed by foreigners, so that our country is burned in the skin and bones, and the appearance is withered, the people are poor and the wealth is exhausted, and the Luo excavated are exhausted, mostly affected by the Treaty of Nanjing. Therefore, the political bedbugs are more harmful than the insect bedbugs. Therefore, the name of the bedbug is Nanjing, and it is quite appropriate to be worthy of its name.</p>
<p>According to the research of entomologists, bedbugs are a common and special pest in the insect species, living by sucking human blood, and their reproduction is so fast that no one can cure them. It is true that wherever bedbugs go, people have no day of peace. If there are bedbugs in the house, they cannot sleep well, their spirits are tired, they cannot catch them all, they cannot search them all, they are prevented in one place and born in another, they are removed on the left and disturbed on the right. Therefore, the invasion of bedbugs is no different from political aggression. Therefore, the name of the bedbug is Nanjing, which has a profound meaning, although the facts are different, but the nature is the same.</p>
<p>However, the disturbance of bedbugs to public security has a certain period. In spring and summer, the clowns jump on the beams and are rampant. In autumn and winter, they slightly converge and hide in the depths, not daring to come out to make trouble again. And the chaos bugs in politics have no fixed time and no fixed direction, taking advantage of people's dangers and strangling people's emergencies, and there is no way to punish them. Therefore, it is easy to remove insect bedbugs, but it is difficult to remove political bedbugs, and there are many kinds of bedbugs, not only Nanjing bugs. Others, such as local tyrants and evil gentry who bully the people, are also bedbugs. Corrupt officials who exploit the common people are also bedbugs. Others, such as treacherous merchants, are all bedbugs. There are so many bedbugs, even if a special company is set up, I am afraid that they cannot be caught all.</p>

<p>— Hua Jia</p>
<p>It was on just such an early autumn day, in the distant south where the morning still held the warmth of summer heat, that we two young men were hurrying along. The path from the lower temple to the upper temple was a rugged mountain road of nearly an hour's distance. However, if we didn't ascend the mountain in this early morning, before the sun exerted its power, I believe we would be like the birds in the fairy tale about the southern sun country, who, greedy for human flesh, forgot that the sun would rise and scorch them to death. Indeed, if one were to travel this hour-long mountain path during the fiercest heat of the sun, it would surely make one more susceptible to catching a cold, which would be precisely the opposite of the purpose of climbing the mountain. Originally, on the way up the mountain, there was a means of transportation called "shan dou" (mountain sedan), which was often used, and if you simply informed the receptionist monk at the lower temple, he would quickly summon it for you, as the people who carried the shan dou were the "xiang huo" (a type of worker who did menial labor in the temple) of his immortal temple. However, because we were both young men, and both had boasted of our ability to walk vigorously, we resolved to forego all means of transportation and tackle this journey, which was not short.</p>
<p>When I had visited this place several years ago, the path up the mountain was still the bird path used by woodcutters to chop firewood, but now it was different. The winds of the city had destroyed the wilderness, replaced by a flat highway. Although the flatness salvaged the rugged and difficult mountain road, it could not withstand the heat of the sun; on the contrary, walking on these flat highways only made the heat more unbearable. When the flat road was behind us, we had already reached the mountainside. On the mountainside, we still had to walk the winding paths called "sheep intestines," but it was much cooler. The mountain was full of tall cedar and palm trees, providing shade that made the breeze on the road extremely pleasant. It was like walking on the road to paradise, forgetting fatigue and walking happily.</p>
<p>Beside the road was a small stream, mountain water cascading down from the waterfall, so its clear, cool, and pleasant atmosphere, and the murmuring sound of the flowing water, immersed the entire valley in a joyful melody. The singing of birds in the early morning was particularly melodious and clear, combined with the unknown mountain songs sung by the wood-gathering women, honestly, it would be enchanting to be captivated in this valley. However, because our stomachs felt hungry, poetic emotions could no longer detain us, and we continued to advance.</p>
<p>"Qingyun Ancient Temple"</p>
<p>A burst of murmuring chanting of Buddha's name wafted into our ears, and we also discovered a horizontal inscribed board with these words on a large fire-resistant wall. Thus, our destination had arrived. Moreover, in my experience, it was possible here to obtain a vegetarian meal that wasn't too bad to fill our hungry stomachs. Therefore, we quickly went to the reception hall to find the receptionist monk. Alas, what a letdown! When we met, the result was a disappointment beyond my expectations. Perhaps because his snobbish eyes had discerned from the embellishments of our clothing that we were not the "benefactors" he had envisioned, the ensuing reception was a cold one. A few minutes later, he sent a young novice to take us to tour the scenic spots of their ancient temple. Thus, following the cries of "Amitabha," we walked past places like the Immortals' Cauldron, Sleeping Buddha Pavilion, Money-Shaking Tree, Guanyin Hall, Great Hero Hall, Eighteen Arhats, and so on, and then returned to the reception hall. By this time, our stomachs were forcing us to negotiate with the receptionist monk regardless of everything. In the end, we used a symbol and badge of "officialdom" to divert his snobbish gaze and obtained a not very cold vegetarian meal to satisfy our hunger. In retaliation, we were also stingy with our generosity, and after eating, we left without saying a word.</p>
<p>On our way back, we discussed how the ancient temple, although hidden deep in the mountains, was still immersed in the dream of gilding gold.</p>
<h3 id="e249">Abandoned Child <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Under a withered, moldy electric lamp, the same color as an old woman's face, a child, not yet two years old, whose parents were unknown, gradually went from convulsions into a dying state, and departed this cruel world.</p>
<p>Two lines of glistening tears hung under the old woman's eyelids. After a year of personally caring for him, she was as attached to him as if he were her own child, grieving. Just a quarter of an hour ago, the child had called out "Mama," and that sound still remained crisply in her ears. Tomorrow, tomorrow, even this corpse would be eternally lost from her hands! She bowed her head, as if in repentance:</p>
<p>"Child, my calling you that is perhaps an insult to you! But you can't blame me, you know, your parents haven't sent any news for a long time, and not a penny of money, it's been four months! And I can't find them."</p>
<p>She leaned against the edge of the bed, staring blankly at the child, crying sadly.</p>
<p>Although she was innocent in her conscience toward him, her heart couldn't withstand this accidental pressure. In a daze, she felt that she was still the perpetrator of this tragedy. This little soul wouldn't forgive her in the underworld. When he was sick, she hadn't let him see a doctor. When he was hungry, her milk wasn't enough, she hadn't fed him his fill. Now that he was dead, this was the last time he troubled her, and she still couldn't give him a small coffin to atone for her sins... An inexplicable terror was surrounding her, on the bed, in the corners of the room: she was like being thrown into a frigid, snowy area, her body just trembling, her two hands with protruding veins touching the withered cheeks of the child.</p>
<p>"You can't go with him. It's not our fault. His parents don't care. We fulfilled our duty by raising him for four months. That counts for something."</p>
<p>The old man saw his wife's infatuation and greatly disapproved. Although the two old people didn't have any children themselves, they usually cherished the child very much.</p>
<p>"His parents are perhaps dead; otherwise, they wouldn't be so heartless!"</p>
<p>"Dead? - I heard they got divorced, and neither of them wanted to raise the son."</p>
<p>"Oh heavens! What a sin! This kind of heart is unacceptable. There will be retribution in the future. So heartless!" The foster mother felt that the sins she was worried about should be the responsibility of his parents, so she felt a little more at ease.</p>
<p>"Conscience! When things are good, they only care about their own happiness. Once they have a falling out, they don't even care about the child. This is the game that modern young men and women play!"</p>
<p>The old man was angry with a hint of lament, the pupils deeply embedded in his eye sockets frozen.</p>
<p>"Then, where have they gone now? We should find them since the child has died, to avoid others gossiping."</p>
<p>"The man went abroad with his new wife, and the woman lives in Hankou with her lover. Are you going to find them? Even if you find them, they might not admit it."</p>
<p>The two fell silent. The night deepened in a sad loneliness. The child's corpse gradually became rigid. A kind of righteous indignation suddenly arose in the old woman's heart:</p>
<p>"If the child could grow up, he shouldn't acknowledge such parents either! They didn't put in any effort, only raised him for a short time!... Then what do we do with the child's body?"</p>
<p>"Call Little Sanzi tomorrow to testify."</p>
<p>Little Sanzi was the one who initially brought the child over. In the previous months, Little Sanzi brought a few dollars from his father every month, but in the past few months, Little Sanzi couldn't find his father either. Only after the child got sick did Little Sanzi say that his father had gone abroad and his mother had followed someone else. The old man initially feared that if the old woman knew this news, she would look down on the child, so he delayed telling her until today.</p>

<p>The old woman selected some cleaner clothes to put on the child, sobbing as she continued until the dawn of the city.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, the old man called Little Sanzi. Little Sanzi sighed twice, then went to the charitable hall to get a small box, put the child's body inside. When the old man and Little Sanzi carried the small box out the door, the foster mother, who had been with him for a year, sobbed and said:</p>
<p>"It's not my fault, child. You can only blame your parents!"</p>

Who is obstructing us, obstructing us heavily? (Chorus) Who is obstructing our path, obstructing us heavily? Let's not sigh about the difficulty of traveling. Sighing is useless! (Chorus) Useless! We, we, we want to detonate the explosives buried underground, aim at it! (Chorus) Boom! Boom! Boom! Watch the peaks collapse and the mountains crumble, the heavens and earth turn upside down! Blast down the mountain peaks, the road will be easy to build, straighten your chest, unite and don't let go, we, we are the pioneers of road opening! We, we are the pioneers of road opening! Boom!

<p>Wang Lun is mediocre and untalented. He is too jealous of heroes. His heart is dishonest and his mind is small. How can he be the leader of the Liangshan bandits? Fortunately, he has three helpers. Du Qian and Song Wan invited him to come. Zhu Gui is always recruiting for business. Wang Lun wandered the Jianghu when he was poor and ragged. Thanks to Chai Jin's righteous cultivation. A letter came from Shuibo. Only then was he able to weigh silver and become the master. He hated him for turning his face and being ungrateful. He actually pushed Lin Chong down. As the saying goes, "Look at the monk's face, not the Buddha's face." He didn't remember that Little Whirlwind had recommended him in a letter. He claimed that the mountain was too small to accommodate a swan. The water is too shallow to hide a dragon, a big mistake. Lin Chong had no choice but to plead. He begged in every way. Wang Lun was afraid of future disasters. Therefore, he was determined not to tolerate him and his heart would not turn back. He said that if he wanted to stay, he must show merit. He must first submit a letter of intent. Not even a little water or tea was left. He severed his friendship at the edge of the water. The snow land's three limitations aroused the hero's hatred. It stirred up Lin Chong's disaster. How will the subsequent mutiny escape disaster?</p>

<p>A year passes easily, and autumn winds arrive again. The Double Ten Festival of the 24th year is about to come.

The content includes speeches and thoughts on the Double Ten Festival, writings and photos of celebrities, and news from the modern broadcasting industry, photos of major singers, and caricatures of celebrities, which are exceptionally wonderful. Because the agency is reporting on major radio stations such as Huadong, Hangye, Zhonghua, and Yongsheng, we have recently heard that the number of people writing to reserve copies is increasing daily. Those who wish to reserve a copy only need to attach a one-cent postage stamp and send it to the agency at No. 173 Tianjin Road. The actual selling price after publication is twenty cents. Don't miss the opportunity. (Boxin)</p>

<p>The Global Harmonica Research Association, located at No. 503, 2nd Floor, North Sichuan Road, is the highest authority in the country for the study of harmonica music. Classes are taught at all levels from beginner to specialized research. The association has always been known for its perfect management and serious teaching, and is highly praised by harmonica scholars in general. It is understood that the association's previous classes are coming to an end. It is now continuing to recruit 100 new free members for the harmonica elementary class and research class. In addition, the association's president, Mr. Bao Mingshan, has recently responded to the repeated requests of harmonica enthusiasts and will add a special harmonica class, specializing in the short-scale harmonica playing method, which is still the first of its kind in our country, and many other newly invented playing methods. It is also heard that at the same time, Mr. Bao will teach comrades from other places at the Huamei Radio Station in order to popularize this playing method. The classes are all taught by instructor Zheng Mo and President Bao. Those in this city who are interested in learning can go directly to the association's office at No. 11, Yuanchengli, Anren Street, Xinbeimen in the city to apply. (The Public)</p>

<p>Most of the female stars who arrived were fourth- or fifth-rate actors, such as: Xia Peizhen, Hu Di, Cang Yinqiu, Yan Fei, Zhou Xuan, etc. "Wild River Woman Knight" Xu Qinfang also arrived and left with Chen Kengran.</p>

<h3 id="e259">The Latest Composition of Residences (Part 2) <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Kenichi Ichura, Translated by Guangzheng Zhang</p>
<p>However, the so-called air conditioning method involves delivering heated air with appropriate humidity into the room during winter, and delivering cooled air with reduced humidity into the room during summer. This is certainly very expensive, but also the most ideal. This method has recently been widely adopted in large commercial buildings, but its adoption in residences is still rare. Considering the importance of living, it is highly desirable that residences, schools, or offices can adopt it.</p>
<p>The initial means necessary for nighttime lighting was oil lamps. However, this has reached its peak and given way to the electric light era for the nighttime lives of all humanity. There was a temporary use of gas lamps in the past, but that is now history. It is foreseeable that they will not be able to usurp the position of electric lights in the future. There have also been various developments in the forms of electric lighting. However, indirect lighting, which is now generally considered ideal but has not yet become widespread, is not very popular due to economic reasons and the feeling of loneliness due to the lack of a light source elsewhere. It is likely that neon lighting will become popular in the future.</p>
<p>In addition to lighting, the uses of electricity in residences include power and fuel. The power required for various simple appliances is almost entirely supplied by electricity, and even more things have been electrified to date. For example, refrigerators, sewing machines, fans, vacuum cleaners, radios, clocks, washing, and the opening and closing of doors and windows, as well as transportation, all use electricity. On the other hand, electricity is used for cooking, irons, heating, and hot water supply.</p>
<p>Hot water supply has progressed from the original method of large-scale processing using boilers to the convenience of enjoying the widespread supply of gas water heaters and electric water heaters.</p>
<p>Hygiene equipment includes several types, such as sewage treatment, drainage, and waste and dust disposal. Among these, sewage treatment is the most important. Here, if public sewage ditches are well-constructed, it is very simple. However, as sewage ditches are still not widespread, each household has no other choice but to install septic tanks. These septic tanks have recently been simplified and made less expensive. Therefore, their construction does not require a large construction cost. Today, as drainage equipment is simplified, the proportion of hygiene equipment costs has gradually decreased, and it has also been gradually developed and improved.</p>
<p>The fuel for residences has been replaced by gas, which is now the most popular, instead of the former charcoal and coal. However, as mentioned earlier, it is destined to be replaced by electricity in the future. Indeed, while the sooty kitchens with charcoal have not completely disappeared, most of the cooking already uses gas. Although it is also widely used in irons, heating, cooling, and hot water supply, it has many shortcomings compared to electricity, except for its lower price.</p>
<p>In order to implement such equipment in residences, it is necessary to organically combine design and equipment to create a mutually rational system. Because this relies on the management of the entire project, it must be simple and unified. For example, the connection between the kitchen, heating room, and laundry room, as well as the connection between the bathroom, washroom, and toilet, can save area and reduce equipment costs. Therefore, from the perspective of practical living, design issues are particularly important.</p>
<p>For example, to improve the structure, a bathroom is installed upstairs. Because it is adjacent to the bedroom, there is no need for a dressing room. Also, if the toilet is placed in the bathroom, flushing is convenient and no sanitary efforts are required, and the appearance is not bad. In this way, a large area is saved, and the use is extremely easy. The laundry room might as well be located in the basement, equipped with an electric iron, which is also one of the home factories.</p>
<p>From an electrical perspective, if each room is in the appropriate location, electricity can be saved rationally. Electrical anti-theft equipment (automatic special doorbell) can also be created at a low price. The automatic adjustment of electric heating has also been gradually put into practical use recently and there is hope for its application.</p>
<p>The various types of equipment described above, regardless of their extremely complex mechanical structure, have very simple methods of use. However, conversely, it can also be said that their use must be paid considerable attention. That is to say, if general scientific knowledge does not advance, then these advanced equipment cannot be popularized. Because the use of these equipment shows that considerable scientific knowledge is necessary. Due to the steady progress of electrical equipment, the price of electricity will inevitably tend to decrease, which will make life more comfortable.</p>
<p>Residences are not only entrusted to construction, but also have related equipment. They are not only seen as machines for living, but also bear the responsibility of a complete living container. It is very gratifying to understand it this way. This complete living container has a solid and complete structure and a rational layout and design. These three companions depend on architects engaging in organic control to make them possible. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e260">Swedish Public Housing Architecture (Part 1) <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Buren</p>
<p>Currently, throughout Sweden, public apartments provide 22,000 residences, and the residents are mostly workers, merchants, partners, lower-level officials, and their families. In Stockholm alone, 600,000 people live in these apartments, accounting for 10% of the city's population. In other urban areas, there are more than ten places that imitate Stockholm's housing cooperative system, the largest of which are Gothenburg, Malmö, and Norrköping.</p>
<p>Sweden has spent 80,000,000 yuan on building houses nationwide. The development of housing construction has provided jobs for the unemployed and encouraged industry. At the same time, the living standards of most people have improved, and the health of countless elderly and children has been protected.</p>
<p>Swedish public apartments are called "Elephanthouses." Their tall and solemn appearance and the thoughtful and clean interior equipment are beyond the reach of public housing in other countries. Walking through the gate, visitors see a public playground, crowded with children. Along the paths, there are lawns, fences, and flowerbeds, neat and elegant, with public gardeners specializing in care.</p>
<p>There are 205 small apartments that accommodate two to four families. A gentle knock on the door will be answered, because the residents are happy to show their new homes to visitors. The bathroom has hot and cold water taps and a cosmetic cabinet. The kitchen has clean tableware, an electric refrigerator, a gas stove, and a white porcelain sink.</p>
<p>In the room, there is a bed and a couch. A table is placed in the center of the room, with books and vases on it. Looking from the door to the balcony, you can see flower baskets hanging from the ceiling. Blue awnings shield the sunlight. The bedroom is small, but Swedes are used to living in narrow houses. If the house is large, they will divide it into two.</p>
<p>The top floor of the apartment is a public nursery. Working women can leave their children here when they go out to work, entrusting them to well-trained nannies, and the cost is quite limited. The public nursery has a dining room and a library. Storytelling for one hour is one of the daily tasks. There is also a treatment room where children are treated if they have slight symptoms. The nursery is surrounded by a rooftop garden, which is most suitable for sunbathing and resting.</p>
<p>The equipment in the apartments is not simple, but it is based on the principle of not hindering convenience and comfort. The latest apartments are all built with steel and reinforced concrete and are equipped with automatic elevators. All electrical equipment that can replace manual labor is available. Each floor is equipped with an automatic waste conveyor. The windows and doors are made of single-piece "mirror glass," which does not obstruct the line of sight. When the windows and doors need to be washed, they can be rotated inward, so the washers do not have to stand on the window sills. Each floor is covered with painted cloth. Each residence is equipped with a wireless radio, which is indirectly broadcasted by the switchboard in the apartment.</p>
<p>There is also a kind of equipment installed in a small house, which can automatically clean carpets, mats, and other items. All residents must disinfect their furniture before moving in.</p>
<h3 id="e261">Research on Interior Lighting Distribution (Part 2) <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— Qin</p>
<p>The source of light can be divided into two types: main and secondary. The former includes sunlight and lamplight, while the latter includes reflected light and light emitted by colors. Therefore, the application of interior paint is greatly related to the beauty of a room. If applied properly, it can adjust the deficiency of sunlight and lamplight, and its light often has a diffuse nature, without the disadvantage of dazzling the eyes, which is of great benefit to the interior decoration. Paint has different strengths of reflection of light. Light colors have strong reflection, while dark colors have weak reflection. To obtain a perfect color scheme, it is necessary to adjust paints of different strengths to achieve a suitable match. The following table shows the ratio of reflection of light for various colors, taking the reflection of magnesium oxide (98%) as the standard.</p>
<p>White ... 84.0%</p>
<p>Off-white ... 70.4%</p>
<p>Scarlet ... 69.4%</p>
<p>Ivory ... 64.3%</p>
<p>Yellow ... 60.5%</p>
<p>Flesh color ... 56.0%</p>
<p>Tan ... 55.4%</p>
<p>Light green ... 54.1%</p>
<p>Light gray ... 53.6%</p>
<p>Light blue ... 45.5%</p>
<p>Aluminum gray ... 41.9%</p>
<p>Brown ... 23.6%</p>
<p>Dark red ... 14.4%</p>
<p>Dark green ... 9.8%</p>
<p>Dark blue ... 9.3%</p>
<p>Black ... 10.0%</p>
<p>Reflected light is most suitable for interior light, but there are different kinds of reflected light. At the same time, the color matching must seek psychological comfort, and should not be too stimulating. There are three types of reflected light: (1) Specular reflection, in which the light travels along a certain straight line, that is, the angle of incidence must be equal to the angle of reflection. This kind of light has glare, which can easily cause strain on the eyes, so it is best to avoid it, such as light reflected from glass, polished metal surfaces, and mirrors. (2) Spread reflection, which is generally light reflected from metal surfaces or metal particles. Most of the light travels in the same direction, but not along the same straight line, so it appears spread after reflection. This can make the eyes slightly relaxed. (3) Diffuse reflection, which is the kind of light we need most. Its reflection comes from ordinary unpolished flat surfaces, such as white walls and ceilings. When light shines on this kind of flat surface, it is reflected and scattered in all directions, so it can make strong light not irritate the eyes, and achieve the requirement of brightness and pleasing to the eye.</p>
<p>From this point of view, if the coordination of light is to make it suitable for our residence and give full play to the beauty of the architecture, it is necessary to have a considerable understanding of the psychological influence and decorative value of various kinds of light. At the same time, it is necessary to make various colors obtain a balanced configuration according to the difference in their reflectivity. What is described here is only a brief discussion of the general situation. As for the coordination of light, the places where we usually rest, such as bedrooms, living rooms, and entertainment venues such as theaters, should use soft light and pleasing colors. Strong light and stimulating colors are suitable for places that make people excited, lively, and energetic. The color configuration in hospitals should be particularly studied, because it has a great impact on the psychology of patients, and special attention should be paid to the decoration of the ceiling. White light is not suitable for workplaces, and straw color or light green is more gentle. In offices, schools, shops, hotel lobbies, and special dining rooms, these places all require sufficient energy, agility, and liveliness, so the appropriate application of white has an indispensable value.</p>
