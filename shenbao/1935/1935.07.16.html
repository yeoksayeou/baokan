<h3>水災已到嚴重罐頭</h3>
<p>— 都</p>
<p>洪水恐怖之襲來。吾人旣已一再貢其危言。今當大汛臨頭。險象日增無已。澧樊淪為澤國。宜沙形同孤懸。贛鄂兩省受災縣市。據報已達六十以上。武漢處長江中游之末。承建領傾瀉之衝。大水恐慌。深中人心。雖經連日拚命搶護。迄難緩和危迫形勢。遷流所屆。未易設想。而北方之黃河。復在鄄城决口使。東平鉅野　城菏澤等縣。並受其害。若令奪流改道。寖且侵及蘇北。他如伊洛灤淮等水。皆有漫溢之患。晋陝豫皖諸省。並罹沉溺之災。曠觀國中。洪流遍地。吾民以憔悴餘生。重丁茲厄。黃臺之瓜。一摘再摘。瘠牛之僨。知難免矣。</p>
<p>天災流行。原為列國之所恒有。要在防制得宜。方免擴大之虞。我國當事者。病在因循不肯趕辦。空談周知實幹。每以遲迥紆折之故。釀成不可收拾之局。卽就茲回治水而言。事前忽于準備。臨變徒滋張皇。要為無可諱飾之事實。而國人陷於短視錯誤。不思通力合作。亦未嘗不增事熊之嚴重性。長江原為善良之渠流。祇以中游宣洩不暢。遂多偏壅橫决之患。所謂「江之利在蜀江之害在楚。」宜為鄂人稔知之習諺。固應早籌防範之良策者也。且二十年之大永災。使漢市浸水者四月有奇。已車非遙。寗遂　忘。奈何不戒前車之覆轍。重睹今日之險象耶。</p>
<p>事已至此。督過有所不暇。諉責亦非其時。惟有全國一致羣策羣力。以勉圖擺脫當前之嚴重壓迫。在搶險工程進行地方。當局應不惜採取一切必要之步。驟匪特民工應予强制懲用。卽論財力亦當設法集中。次要之政費。駐在之軍隊。均不妨移轉使用。藉紓目前之念。而官民間尤應悉力協作。母涉疑忌。須知生死存亡所關。豈復秦越肥瘠可比。量力肆應。亟不容緩矣。至水災尙未波及之區域。無論官方與人民。均應未雨綢繆。以免臨事介皇。如蘇建廳之趕築江蘇大堤。要不失為及時奮起之圖。尤望持之以毅力。以實幹苦幹急幹為依歸。而於其他利害相關之省分。亦應隨時洽商。互為呼應。此外關於災區善後。如浮骼之掩埋。污物之排除。災民之撫卹與安頓。皆應由地方當局妥速處理。一方以免災民之流離。一方亦防疫癘之潛滋。濁流滔天。浮屍滿江。災民露宿。綿亘百里。此為若何慘切之景象。詎可不急為之所乎。</p>
<p>要之。搶險與救災。誠為目前當務之亟。而在汛期過後。如何以策來日之安寗。謀根本之補苴。必須當局與地方人士。於創痛初復之際。確定進行計劃。若事過境遷。卽便置而不論。則來年大汛。固不難再肆猖獗也。秦汾傅汝霖等於勘察水勢之報吿中。亦曾提及汛後措施。雖屬治標之議。要亦防災之道。補牢雖晚。及羊未亡。深願其能切實見諾施行。而勿復為空言之徒託也。</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （瘦鵑）</p>
<p>這年頭兒做人，太難了！死旣死不得，活又活不成；進旣不能進，退又退不了；上自一國之大，下至箇人之小，都陷入了一簡亘古未有的僵局。　你想伏著不勁吧，那麽　居國内，眞無異井底之蛙，抬起眼來，不知天多高而地多厚；幷且你旣生著一雙眼睛，就不能不瞧種種瞧不上眼的事情；你旣生着兩隻耳朶，就不能不聽種種聽不進耳的消息。這是多麽的乏味，多麼的難受！</p>
<p>有志之士，不滿於現實，於是遠迢迢地跑到國外去，想去瞧瞧人家的模樣兒，好回來將自已的改善一番。吾友周劍雲伉儷和胡蝶女士，便是抱著這樣的宗旨，浩然而作歐洲之遊。</p>
<p>如今周胡他們已回來了，今天京滬各界特在逸園開了一箇歡迎大會，以表示一片慰勞之意。但區區所要請問他們的，只是一些風花雪月之類：烏拉山的雪景如何？德國的牛排好吃麽？巴黎的裸舞好石麽？日内瓦湖比西湖怎樣？意大利的石像美此外的一切，我不敢問，料知一問之下，定他們一肚子牢騷來的，那還是以不問爲妙。</p>
<h3>悠閒的七月</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>堂弟從家鄉來信說：</p>
<p>…六月裏連落半個多月黃霉雨，稻田裏的水只嫌多，車水傢伙擱置在堂屋前，那麽意外地得到安閒的淸福似的，靜聽着村子中的男女的談說，不時還有一二句調笑，年老的蹲在高門檻上吸旱烟，娘兒坐在竹凳上結麻，年輕夥子抓頭摸耳朶，想溜到街上去抹牌。悠閒的七月呵！……</p>
<p>七月於我也是悠閒的。</p>
<p>放了暑假，日子就沉長啦，從朋友的書架上搜羅來大批小說集。糖和白金龍是常備的。早晨五點鐘就醒在床上，夏天是我節慾的季節，逸娟回自己家去息夏了。趁頭腦淸醒的時候看幾頁上學期的講義，覺得講義上的字比小說上的要沉悶得多，七月該讓人家悠閒着過日子吧。</p>
<p>可是，衍車夫依舊在午後的陽光裏奔波着，棕色的胳膊，棕色的腿，「他們亦同樣過着七月，他們爲什麽不能得到悠閒？」想喲想的，便睡着在籐椅上了。醒來的時候太陽仍老高，走出家門　到公園去的路上，一個考爾門式的男子推着一輛孩車，慢慢　進胡同去，我想他不會寂寞了。他有着一個解悶的賓貝。</p>
<p>探手到褲袋摸烟的時候，猛刺裏來了一隻小手，我發現一個三四歲的小乞丐跟着我，嘴裏喃喃地，不高也不低的聲音，叫人聽了厭倦，便扔給一個銅子，噓出一口氣—「悠閒的七月呵。」</p>
<h3>海外珍聞</h3>
<p>— 大千</p>
<p>美國加利福尼亞省巴塞迪那市有美人餞送華僑新聞一則，其熱烈至誠，異於尋常，報紙上特爲詳載，但其所歡送老非所謂我國之黨國要人，而乃一多年在該地之老菜販，是又出於我人想像之外，而同樣値得在我國報章一爲披露者也。菜販名譚勝，初來時爲園丁，年約二十左右，操此業約二十年。乃改營菜販。公平正直，慷慨仁俠，歷三十七年如一日。近年受美國經濟衰落影響，亦尚不肯改易其常度，殆有我國韓康賣藥之風，故凡與其交易之美國婦人，咸敬佩之，近以發覺積蓄無存，再留將爲地方政府累之故，斷然自動欲回中國，舊時與其交易之美國婦人，得此消息，感其向日爲人之公平正直慷慨仁俠，自動集合，爲其送行。到者七十五，大多爲年高之婦人。卽在菜販所居小木屋旁之樹蔭下，設桌陳餐，贈花，舉杯祝別，多泣下者，並醵美金一百元，購買在中國之西方銀行支票一張以爲壽，此皆美報之所載，可以見其眞矣。「言忠信，行篤敬，」將無往而不可，茲豈非一明效大騐　？</p>
<h3>食瓜迷夢</h3>
<p>— 彤父</p>
<h3>蠅與霍亂</h3>
<p>— 悟機</p>
<p>蠅類爲傳染霍亂之通常娂介，繁殖於糞便及垃圾之中，設使其間雜有患霍亂症病人之糞便，卽染及飛來之蠅；蠅之本身，並不因此患病；第將若干病菌帶於腿部而飛去，然後停集於未經遮蓋之食物，而將若干病菌遺留其上，取食此項食物之人，乃將霍亂病菌吞入腹內，旋入腸胃，滋生繁殖，並侵及腸壁，於是發生霍亂病之病狀！</p>
<p>夏季霍亂最易發生，倘不卽早預防，則一經發現，殊爲危險！吾人旣知蠅爲傳染霍亂之媒介，而垃圾堆便所等陰濕之處又爲納藏病菌之大本營，故預防之法最宜使用藥品如五洲藥房之「亞林臭水」澆灑居室各處，則微菌消滅，蠅類絕跡，疫病自無從發生矣。</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十六回　簾幕隱啼痕難逃冷眼衣冠誇幸運曾到權門</p>
<p>志前道：人生在世，不能光是爲了穿吃，還有比穿衣吃飯更重大的事在那裏呢。可是你這只知道和人要喜錢的人，又那裏會明白。茶房笑道：這有什麽不明白，報紙上如今常登着，就是我們這裏客人，嘴裏也是常說着，不就是愛情兩個字嗎？只是他那樣由西邊逃難來的姑娘，也不配談這個。志前只是帶了笑容向他點着頭，並不和他再說是非。洗過了臉，斟了一杯茶慢慢的喝着，不知不覺的，放下茶杯，又去沉沉的想着。最後他想到，只有暫時出去，找個朋友談談，才可以把心事撇了開去。因之吩咐茶房鎖上房門，表示着必定出門去的决心，然後慢慢的向前面院落走了來。當他快到賈多才門口的時候，也不知是什麽緣故，心房自然的會下然亂跳起來。因之兩隻脚，也不能聽人作主，只管慢慢的緩着。這時本日的報紙，也是剛放到桌上，旅客們將桌子圍了個圈子，正在天棚底下看報。志前也就擠到人叢裏，胡亂找了一張報，站着看。偸眼看賈多才屋子裏時，以前洞開的兩扇玻璃窗戶，現在却緊緊的關閉上了。雖然隔了玻璃，還看得到裏面，却是不大淸楚。彷彿只露出了一角床帳，却看不到人影子。不過房門口垂下了門廉子，却不曾關上房門，似乎屋子裏人也並不曾出去。看了一會子報，再抬頭向那邊去時，這又不能不讓他心裏難過一陣。（二六七）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>不知道我這幾句善意的忠告，何以會使伊震驚。但伊却還不止震驚咧！伊並把兩顆眸子牢牢地釘住着我，透出很憤怒，又很躊躇的神氣：我其時竞全不覺得害怕，祇覺詫異。幸而隔了一會，伊也不再有什麽表示，仍退回到了御座上去，裝着强笑說道：</p>
<p>「也罷！就依你話，我們還是來坐着玩玩紙牌吧！」</p>
<p>當然，這一次的情形是已給其餘的幾位女官所瞧見了，幷且不久已傳揚了出去；因此當我稟明了太后，退回我們那一間休息室中去休息的當兒，有一位已在宮內執事達數年之久的女官，便鄭重其事的把我喚過去，像一個法官審訊囚犯一般嚴肅地向我問道：</p>
<p>「你難道還不曾知道你自己已犯下了一椿很重大的罪案了嗎？」</p>
<p>「不知道啊！你說我犯了什麽罪呢？」</p>
<p>「老佛爺心上覺得氣悶，有意要到長廊下去散步一會，你却阻擋着伊，使伊仍然坐花宮內；」那女官說到這裏，眞有些聲色俱厲了。「這樣故意的違抗太后的懿旨，豈不是一椿大大的罪案嗎？你別再糊塗了！你得問問看，犯了這樣的罪案，該受何等的處罰？那你才會曉得厲害了！」</p>
<p>給伊這麽一說，我倒的確有些擔心起來了！我自己方才也確曾瞧見太后惡狠狠地看過我；雖然伊到此刻還不曾明白指斥我的罪狀。（三六七）</p>

<h3>金魚飼養法的介紹</h3>
<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>在小小的書齋裏，放着一玻璃缸的金魚，怕誰都不會嫌惡能。　艷的魚鱗，映在　波紫藻中間，便富有詩情畫意。但是嬌弱的　魚，飼養很難。一不　心，便易死亡，茲將日本飼養金魚的方法介紹如下。</p>
<p>日本人對於飼養金魚，十分喜歡。商店的橱窗，常有一缸金魚陳列着，作爲裝飾。尤其是理髮店裏更多，理髮者坐在椅子上，昏悶無聊的時候。便可鑒　缸内活潑的金魚，表演種種的游泳藝術。東京有　魚會的組織，會員無一非金魚迷。作者所介紹的方法，便是該會談話會中山端氏所發表的。該會已成立五十年，有相當經騐，非普通人所能及的。</p>
<p>日本有專門出售金魚的店舖，大公司如白木屋等屋項上，也帶買金魚。其他有地攤夜市，還有放在手推的小車上，高呼出售。此種只能供普通玩賞，大半是推銷美麗的玻璃缸，所以沒有名貴種子。金魚的形態顏色，何止數十百種，難於鑒別，名目更任意品題。普通選擇標準，以頭部圓正，（尖若極醜），體格平均，　部左有對稱者爲上品。顏色以朱紅砂金及緋紅者爲正宗。</p>
<p>金魚的飼養法，從前在大雨的時候，便用洋　蓋關着。現在用木框嵌着賽璐珞，傾斜的蓋在上面。天晴可受日光，天雨可避雨珠。金魚每大須見六小時的日光，否則色彩靴以鮮明。容器過小，或者金魚過多，養氣不足，均易死亡。在小的容器中而欲使金魚長生，惟有少給食物一法，綫形蚯蚓和孑孓，每星期喂食兩次、每次約小梅子大足矣。</p>
<p>每天應使金魚稍稍運動。換水的時候，應當注意兩方面的溫度，不能相差太遠。大約殘留三分之一，然後注水三分之二的新水，他們便很快　的運動起來了。晚上運動遲鈍，最好換人大的容器裏，多吸養氣，以恢復精神。暑天在水面上做了個小的噴泉，水點濺落水面，金魚便很快樂的游動了。反之在秋冬寒冷時，換水應留二分之二，注入三分之一的新水。如若要全部更換，一定要把水在日光中晒成相當的溫度。夜裏密閉缸蓋，到明天再換。金魚受冷是最危險的事情，應當注意的。</p>
<p>金魚的食物也是困難的事情，從前東京小江中，有孑孓和綫狀蚯蚓可得。現在只好採用人　魚解。據談話會結果，以泥鰌（　魚）最爲合宜。先用手指撕成三四塊，金魚便很聰明的吃了他的肉而將骨骼殘留着。還有人把　節（乾木魚，日本特產）的粉末，　着麩麵，作爲金魚的食料。</p>
<p>金魚　食易化，因腹部運動不足，胃囊生病的緣故。水藻也　吸收養氣，故不宜多放，以二三枝爲度，又不能完全沒有。金魚病狀很多，如白　病者，金魚的全身，生着白色粉點。是因爲在溫暖時候，驟然迺冷的緣故。治療方法，將金魚半放手中，以毛筆　一　的冷　水，注在他的上。還有容器裏的水量過淺，多晒太陽。金魚身體便斜着　動，必須要換去一半濁水。食物過多，便生呼吸病，兩片魚鰓擴開　時候，已入第二期病狀了。就是片擴張着，也是生病的現狀，要兩片魚鰓同時閃動，才是健康狀態。倘然發現了呼吸器的時候，應使之絕食。放在大的容器裏將新鮮的水，不住的撒下去，便可恢復健康。此　疾病均易傳染，非隔離不可。</p>
<p>便秘的醫治法，至今尚在研究之中。我們人類便科之後，最好多吃靑菜靑果·魚類或者相同，故靑苔斷不可缺。玻璃器的底上舖着小的石子，便易生苔，可使金魚健康。普通玻璃缸沒有靑苔，是很不合宜的。</p>
<h3>患難夫婦</h3>
<p>— （君謀）</p>
<p>有沈某者，年十四而遭父母雙亡，孤苦貧寒，藉工廠小工以為生，所得甚微，而頗節儉，積數年辛勞之所得，辭廠工之職，小本經營，頗稱順利，兼以克勤克儉，因而年有盈餘，私蓄已近萬元，適值一二八事變，商市墮落，各公債猛跌，沈某以多年辛勞之積蓄，既無相當存貯之所，不若悉數購之公債，蓋亦取孤注一擲之下策耳，豈意一二八事變以後，越不多時，公債復形狂漲，沈某獲利甚豐，遂成巨富，當其度小工生涯之時，有同鄉女子，亦同廠工作，女視沈某勤儉耐勞，知其孤苦無依，一如己身而頗憫惜之，沈某平日衣破履穿，女輒為之縫補，當沈在經濟拮据之時，衣食時感不濟，女無不為之籌措，蓋女已進廠工作多年，辛勞所得，已有相當之積蓄也，沈某因感自身赤貧如洗，果不敢有所妄想，而得該女如此之相助，實深感於五中，沈某年近三旬，既有相當資産，婚娶自屬重要，乃憶及當年同鄉女子相助之情而探詢之，方悉該女因一二八之變，大遭損失，又因工廠被燬，在申度日維艱，不得已而返故鄉，且遭此巨大刺激，百念俱灰，聞有削髮為尼之居心矣，沈某即邀同知友返鄉，探問之下，知女已茹素年餘，而尚未實行其為尼，乃即倩友人與之説合，女因沈某已成富翁，自身不幸而遭此顛沛，身世懸殊，堅却不允，後經沈某多次誠懇之求，女始允以身許，而婚事遂成，以彼倆由患難而結為夫婦，情感之濃，自當異於常人，某日，沈某應友人之邀宴，狂飲大醉，身不由主，偶一失策，一度踄足花叢，竟因此染得淋濁之症，到處醫藥，終難根治，不久即染及妻室，乃亦患赤白帶下之症矣，幸經知友之介紹，購服上海法大馬路西新橋街德行里一號，同仁西藥社經售之「哥那多登」治淋聖藥，每盒二元，沈某服不數盒，即獲根治，其妻亦購上海法租界寧波路六十四號孫緯才父子醫院之内服白帶丸與外用白帶藥，每種各洋二元，如法内服外用。亦於短時日内安全治愈，次年，即一舉得男，從此沈某深知酒後之誤，誓不再犯，永享其健康生活，盡其天年，如沈某者，以孤苦伶仃，赤貧如洗之小工，患難時幸得同鄉女子之助，不至絶途，此其天生之福也，待既顯達，不忘前情，仍苦苦求婚於當年相助而曾遭失意之孤女，此其天賦之誠也，酒後誤事，險遭絶嗣，而得復其健康，此又天之作弄，使之有所警惕，而免其飽暖思淫慾也，然而良藥效騐之靈確，得拯救夫婦二人，痼疾之回春，自亦不可忘也。</p>

<h3>紗花　標紗久跌思漲</h3>
<p>紗市久跌之後、顯有反動回蘇之象、外商在近月補空、遠月則仍放出、同時現紗銷路益覺發展、湘粵兩帮進胃尤健、致人心堅挺、本月份又穿出六十元關外、但多數議論、本月份仍乏人收貨、不過底盤已枯、棉市步漲、紗市當可帶昂、</p>
<p>金鷄反動回好　標紗前市開盤、近月尚平、因上日多頭了結、檯面尚鬆、拍至遠月趨堅、拍至二三盤突然向升、因原棉上昇、且各廠停閉減工者、日見嚴重、棉紗出數據云減少百分之五十左右、於是對於拋空之念較澹、收盤市氣更昂、結果各月比上日收盤價、均漲八角至一元三·四·五角、午後因天氣酷熱、停拍兩星期、查賣出源大五百包、錦昌七百包、賡豐四百包、均昶七百五十包、慎記三百包、益昶一千四百擔、潤康八百包、信誠三百包、買進吉豐一千八百包、大孚七百五十包、合興一千三百包、長餘三百包、長豐八百包、一日間最高低收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>鄂棉區被水　漢口帮曾購進新花</h3>
<p>棉市趨堅、漲勢愈烈、因標金又發現八百五十三元之高峰、七八月期多頭陣綫鞏固、軋空之意、異常濃厚、至新棉鄂境襄樊一帶棉產區域、水患日見嚴重、漢帮購進者尤旺、市盤更高、</p>
<p>鄭標漲勢愈力　標棉前市開盤、近月尚平、拍至遠月反俏、　美棉雖跌十磅音、標金穿出五十元關外、長江上游一帶、水災劇烈、棉田遭淹、為數頗巨、該帮來滬購買新棉、市盤尤緊、八月份陳棉多頭掉期、漲勢亦烈、結果各月比上日收盤價漲一角半至三四角、查賣出大孚二千二百担、源大二千一百担、泰興一千八百担、均昶二千五百担、泰昌　千一百担、信誠一千一百担、長和一千七百担、買進大豐一千四百担、合興四千一百担、昶記一千二百担、長餘一千六百担、慎記一千四百担、元一一千二百担、潤康四千一百担同和　千担、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>海外棉市一週間之回顧</h3>
<p>孟買　上週因人心向多、期貨甚堅、美棉雖有小跌、此間毫無影響、陳棉堅挺原因、半由標花缺少、半由七月期交貨不多、銀價銳升、麥市堅昂、均足助長市氣、日商及某著名操業者復積極購買、期後以多頭了結及投機售出、略生反動、現需不甚滿意、歐洲問訊失望、廠家殊少進意、天氣大致順利、棉區普遍獲雨、附錄上週統計如下、（單位千包）</p>

<h3>糧食　消化大減　杜洋米跌價求售</h3>
<p>本米（滬南）昨日各帮來源忽見轉稀、祇共到十餘號（貨共二千來石）內地行客、經此市面　跌、吃虧不少、相繼來函止售　因之蘇同粳雖成交有限、而行情已可見定、無甚榮辱、惟南港早稻以存底尚夥、且際此酷暑天氣、人心未免較虛、步落一角、而各晚稻續有青島煙台等都辦五百來包、其價亦續見小一二角、變元再度疲修、陰元則無市、（滬北）來源十六七號、市上各貨去胃、本街及鄉戶均清淡、白粳續小一二角、早薄稻又小二角左右、白元跌落三四角、其餘各貨亦小一二角</p>
<p>洋米消化大減、行情步跌六七分至角許不等、蓋內地帮去化旣呆、其他客帮均無暢胃、且河下米棧存各米均以天炎急求脫手、本銜對於洋米交易亦為銳減、長江各帮雖以水災發生需糧甚亟、然各帮去數均微、統市開出西貢六千包、又一百五十噸、高貢　邏小　各米共祗一千六百包、統計不到萬包、而去戶則有本銜內地九江漢口南京天津寗波等、市上雖然熱鬧、奈均趁小應酬而已、</p>
<h3>期粉因浮空抵補而堅</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、見初跌繼定之象、以洋券報價、芝加哥又跌四五六角不等、坎拿大跌一二角、市場人心、因洋麥續跌、前週又續有現貨成交、致近遠期人心、均見不振、本月份初開跌破三角大關、低至二元二角八分半、為最近之新低價、遠期各月份、初以廠方略有拋售、市氣甚疲、旋因業中人心　空、競相抵進、是以交易見暢、市價亦步步轉穩、照目下之環境、如洋麥不再傾銷、市值亦以相宜、後步或可暫時定住也、結果本月份不動、一月份好半分、九十月份不動、十一十二月份好二厘半云、</p>
<p>麺粉交易所、自昨日起祗拍上午、共做六盤、時間仍上午十時、須至天氣轉涼、始行照常開拍下午云、</p>
<h3>行家止拋　麥市跌勢暫定</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、均已疲落、因洋麥報價仍跌、并以業外之購買力、實在薄弱、故雙方之爭競旣少、欲過分上落、亦覺不易、至行家之拋貨、非洋麥續定、不敢再出、市面暫定、即為此故、迨下午開盤、本月份因現麥存厚、廠家又擯住居多、人心微弱、至遠期則以粉市回定、且外匯亦縮、人心稍高、開價回高三五分、觀察前途、如洋麥停止活動、當不致過小也、結果本月份小一分、八月份好二分、九月份好四分、十月份好五分、現麥市面、仍歸擯局、因廠家未進、公會依然未掛、祗行家有數配廠、價與週前相仿云、</p>
<p>芝加哥小麥　七月十二日　七月十三日　上　落</p>
<p>九月份　八二·二五　八〇·三七五　跌一·八七五</p>

<p>共計　一五八、九一、二包</p>
<h3>國產綿白新到千四百件　市勢略鬆</h3>
<p>昨日糖市、雖值關金復漲、但銷路仍極平淡、趨勢呆定、公會劃盤、二四粗砂白現貨呌十五元九角半、轉口貨呌四元八角、太古糖及本廠綿白亦鮮變動、國產正綿赤、昨號方新到一千四百餘包、因此市勢略軟、僅開出二百餘包、較好者為十一元、次照減、惟高貨行方還十一元二角、尚未成交、</p>
<h3>南北貨　廣帮謠傳生仁有加稅說</h3>
<p>生仁昨廣帮中傳說、將有加稅二成之說、故市勢稍挺、當有開出二百餘噸、計開棗仁六元〇五分、提莊碭山仁五元四角半、徐州仁五元二角、均為廣帮辦云、如加稅之說非虛、則後市當看再緊、</p>

<h3>評書與評人</h3>
<p>— 另境</p>
<p>自己待人誠摯的，人家待自己也會誠摯，這在現在已未必可靠，不過「待人以誠」這句老話究竟還不曾宣告破產，總是眞的，評書和待人恰恰一樣。　天下有許多看不破的事情，對於自己個性的看不破就是其中之一。一個個性迂闊或戇直的人，無論人規勸他如何不適於現世社會，也許刹那間果然有點警覺，但一分鐘以後還是覺得自己的處世最有道理。俗語所說的「敝帚自珍」，眞是一定不移之理，其根源在於人各有些自尊心的原故。批評人家一本辛勤寫下來的作品，要是也學了現下一般人的處世方法，出之於勢利，偏見，私情，矯詐，輕慢等態度，那麼如何能獲得被評者心誠悅服呢！所以評書人的一個最主要條件，就是對作品要有尊敬和誠懇。固然世上也有永不接受人家批評的人，待人以誠而人報以欺詐勢利的事情也是有的，不過負這責任的人就不再在評書者了。聽說某有名文人，一天有人把一本批判他的書送去給他看，不道這位名文人冷冷地說了三個字道：「這種人…」一面當刻把那冊子往紙簍裏一擲。像這種態度的作家，我想正和現下一般因評書而評人的批評家一個模型裏鑄出來的人物。</p>
<p>有人說過：「只要評者一顯露他的所知道的作者多於書中所能吿訴他的，他的貶責卽刻成爲攻擊，他的譏刺就會成爲侮辱。」我想這話是頗正確的，可以供給中國的一般批評家參考的。</p>
<p>作家寫一篇文或著一本書，他所應該負的責任，正確地說只有這文這書的本身，無論作者平日的生活如何狂嫖亂賭卑鄙下流，批評家只應從書本裏去找「有毒」或「有益」，至於作者的行爲是用不到批評家去費心的，社會道德和國家法律自然會加以制裁的。</p>
<p>然而中國歷史上却偏偏多「因人論文」或「因文罪人」的故事，這些都不免是「勢利眼」在作祟呵！</p>
<h3>惱</h3>
<p>— 湯美</p>
<p>該打五下的時鐘，纔鐺鐺地打兩下，孔珊便像一頭蟋蟀似地從溫暖的被窩裏跳了出來。</p>
<p>孔珊的能在早上五時起床，還是最近一星期的事。在一星期前，他還是非睡到午前十時，是不能起來的。若在十時前，去拉拉他的耳朶，他會活像一隻猪玀似地哼兩聲，翻一個身又睡着了的。可是，近一星期來，他每於淸晨五時前就醒了，而且每於應該打五下的時鐘纔打兩下，就急忙忙地起來了</p>
<p>他起來後的第一件工作，旣不是刷牙洗臉，也不是折壘被褥，而是給他的小情人千代子寫情書。他給千代子寫情書，已有一個星期的歴史了。一本化了五十仙的高價買來的蜜綠色信箋，也快要撕完了。可是，他給千代子的情書，到現在還沒有寫起來，他痛恨他自己的來到日本太遲了，——他到日本纔滿三個月。他也痛恨他自己的在這三個月中的不用功，以致現在，連一對日文的情書都寫不起來。</p>
<p>他在這一星期中，所以起得這樣早，因爲在早上可以有一副淸澄的頭腦來做，在他看來是不是容易的事，——給他小情人千代子寫情書的事。可是，在早上：他的腦袋儘管是怎樣地淸澄，而在蜜綠色信箋上活躍着的，除「拜啟」二字外，便是用連日本人都不很認識的日本字母寫成的一個「但是」了</p>
<p>中國的情書在第一行，是應該寫「我的心肝呀！」或「我的小安琪兒喲！」等等的情書套語。可是，日本的對於書信上的稱呼，是放在信的來尾的，而在信的第一行，是應該放「拜啟」二字，這，他在一本日本語贖本上學來的乖。</p>
<p>今天，孔珊起床後，不加思案地在舖平了的蜜綠色信箋上，用兩號派克的闊筆尖寫上了「拜啟」兩字。寫道兩字時的安謐和熟練，和給他老子的信上，寫上父親大人滕下敬禀者」等的神情有些相彷彿，因爲他寫「拜啟」二字的歴史，也有一星期之久原故。</p>
<p>「拜啟……」</p>
<p>「寫些什麽呢？」孔珊把筆端觸觸博士架眼鏡脚傍的太陽穴，又不住的在「拜啟」之上用筆尖懸空地畫圓圈。他是簡直和以前數天的早晨一樣地不知所措了。他那剛纔的安謐和熱練，也在寫完「啟」字的最後一筆時消滅了。</p>
<p>孔珊並不是沒有話寫，他要活躍在那蜜綠色信箋上的話，正多着呢！若用大中華民國的國字寫時，他可以毫不費力地爲成一封十萬八千字的，像火一般熱；蜜一般甜的長信。然而，很不幸，現在所要寫的，是見了就要頭痛的日本文。</p>
<p>他，不住地把筆端觸太陽穴，又不自覺地拿筆尖在「拜啟」二字上儘懸空畫圓圈。</p>
<p>「拜啟，但是……」</p>
<p>「拜啟」二字的下面，不知在什麽時候起，就多了「但是」一字。這個「但是」，他知道是在自己出神時，不知不覺地寫上的。正如他和千代子說話時，在嘴角邊掛上像老太婆的念佛珠似的一長串的「但是」，沒有兩樣。所謂和千代子講情話，也不過像啞子似地做手勢；拿瓦片在地面上畫圖以及滿嘴的「但是」而已。「但是」之老掛在嘴角，或者反使對方感到興趣也未可知。但是（有辦法，在這裏，向孔先生暫借一個來使用一下），現在是在寫信，而並不是在說話。他知道；在信紙上，是不能隨便地加上幾個「但是」，否則；會使對方要覺得頭痛而不能卒讀。因此，他雖然痛惜那化了五十仙的高價買來的蜜綠色信紙快要撕完，而還沒有寫成一封信。可是，他不得不把那張已爬上了「但是」一字的信箋，忍痛撕去。唉！多討厭的「但是」呀！</p>
<p>撕去第一張信箋後，在第二張上，又寫上丁「拜啟」二字。這「拜啟」二字，在他看來，是和鐵一般地可靠，因爲在日本語讀本中，信的第一行第一句，便是「拜啟」兩字。</p>
<p>「拜啟……」</p>
<p>「寫些什麽呢？」他又不知所措了。他不是把筆端觸太陽穴，便是把筆尖兒在「拜啟」二字上儘懸空畫圓圈。「但是」，便在這樣的情狀中，偷偷地，像毛蟲一樣地又爬上了第二張信箋。無疑的，他發見「拜啟」之下，又有「但是」一字時，便怒不可遏地把這張信箋啪的一聲撕了不來，團成一個圓球似的東西，往嘴吧裏一塞。被圍成球形的信紙，便在孔珊的善嚼鷄骨頭的牙齒的夾攻之下，變成了濕膩的小小湯糰，然而，由兩片厚嘴唇中間，像槍彈似地被射在牆根的壁角落裏了。</p>
<p>可是很不幸，「但是」沒有在他的善嚼鷄骨頭的牙齒的反攻之下被燬滅，因爲在第二張的信紙上，又像鬼一樣地出現了。</p>
<p>「唉！員見鬼！」他歡了一口自出娘胎以來從沒有像現在那樣長的長氣後，有氣無力地把第三張信紙又撕了下來。又把它五馬分屍似地撕成無數小片，然後，放在手掌七，用兩片厚嘴唇吹，吹，吹。瑣碎的紙片便在六疊蓆的小房間裏，和雪花一樣地飛，飛，飛。這是孔珊給「但是」的極刑，是：五馮分屍後的磨骨揚灰。</p>
<p>他在這一星期中，也幾乎把，一本日本語讀本翻破（這時，他只有翻這本書的能力）。他知道「可愛」是怎樣寫法的，他知道「淋病」「淋」字，是作「寂寞」解的。然而，這兩句話，無論怎樣，也不能和「拜啟」連在一塊，而「但是」却和馬蝗一樣地儘釘着「拜啟」的脚肚，不肯放鬆一步。這，使孔珊儘撕那寗綠色的信箋而外，簡直毫無辦法。</p>
<p>用五十仙高價買來的信箋，是撕完了。當他再要在信紙上戳上「拜啟」二字時，顯在他眼前的，是一張那麽烏黑的，粗糙的，難看的馬糞紙。於是，他把在平時比自己的生命還要看得貴重的兩號派克鋼筆，望着牆根一丢，便捧十着因思想過度而脹痛的腦袋躺了下去。</p>
<p>房東家裏的時鐘，在打十一點了，孔珊昂起頭來看一眼躺在藍黑色血泊中的兩號派克，又捧着頭躺了下去。</p>
<h3>巴生港中（下）</h3>
<p>— 劉明</p>
<p>—南國歸來記之一—</p>
<p>老頭子將頭轉到岸上時時移動着的林子去，一面却舉手，往背後一揮，狠狠地叱責道：</p>
<p>「滾開！不要在我面前放屁！」</p>
<p>中年胖商人現出像受了侮辱那樣的險色，向着大家說道。。</p>
<p>「……怪不得一的官府都要用刑，……紅毛人的藤鞭，那是有名的，打起來，嚇，眞要話說……其實也就怪不得。……他不肯說實話，那怎麼辦呀？請問，你家是做官的…」</p>
<p>樣子文雅的靑年，在依着船欄欣賞風景的，聽到這里，就掉回臉來，笑喀嘻地接嘴道：</p>
<p>「所以，君子貴乎義，小人則尚乎刑哪！」</p>
<p>一面現着高興的神氣，得意自家又乘機拋了一句文了。</p>
<p>中年胖商人不理睬那位靑年，只是挺一挺眉毛，仍舊說他的。</p>
<p>「…說不定是這樣的，這邊的案子，要在這邊坐幾個月牢，才又趕回去，……那特特打電做什麼呢。……」</p>
<p>麻面小夥子橛着嘴巴做出驕傲的臉子，自言自語地說道：</p>
<p>「那就更好了，正愁着回唐山沒飯吃哩。」</p>
<p>隨即用手拉一下老頭子的肩頭。</p>
<p>「老頭子，你倒好了！可惜我連吉隆坡還沒到過囉。」</p>
<p>老頭子不理他的，只在用緬句話，回他女人的話：</p>
<p>「瑞德宫，地馬沒西補，」（金塔這里沒有。）</p>
<p>麻面小夥子盯了中年胖商人一眼，現出狡猾的樣子，嘆了一口氣。</p>
<p>「唉，看着現成的老太爺也做不成了！」</p>
<p>旁邊的人接嘴打趣道：</p>
<p>「那容易，只要你肯在這里再惹一點禍！」</p>
<p>「好，我就我個人來打架吧！」</p>
<p>麻面小夥子原是蹲着的，說着說着，就一面站了起來，伸展着兩隻格格發響的手臂，一面，斜起眼睛向中年胖商人瞟了一眼，走到正在船　邊玩着的小孩，大聲喊着：</p>
<p>「我要打你這可惡的小胖子</p>
<p>這時船已開攏岸邊了。船尾下的輪子，發着撥水的宏大聲音。岸上的華人街屋安全顯了出來，正沐浴在明朋朗的早上的陽光里面。</p>
<p>甲板上吹拂着馬來亞的晨風。</p>
<p>一會兒，岸上駛到一列馬來聯邦的火車，走下來好些捉槍的紅毛兵，閃着亮晃晃的刺刀，將碼頭上的交通，立刻截止了。</p>
<p>中年胖商人瞟麻面小夥子，一下之後，便向衆人睞一脥眼睛說道：</p>
<p>「唔！我們走開吧！」</p>
<p>麻而小夥子竭力做出不驚慌的樣兒，故意仲長頸子，現着要把細瞧那貨車的神情，鄙夷地說：</p>
<p>「大砲哩？大砲哩？……怎麽拉出大砲來哩？」</p>
<p>老頭子陰沉着臉，沒有一點驚擾的氣色，只是靜靜地吩咐他的緬甸女人和孩子，收拾帶在身邊的東西。</p>
<p>貨車幾道的門忽然一齊打開，潮水似地湧出人來了，有的提着包袱，有的挾着鋪蓋捲。他們衣衫很髒，樣子極狼狽，彷彿逃難的貧民一樣。紅毛兵淸點了人數之後，就一個不地邀上船來。</p>
<p>麻面小夥子知道道是怎麼一會事了，便高興地抓着上來的人問道：</p>
<p>「老哥，你們犯的什麽案呀</p>
<p>「什麽案？丢那媽！就是犯了沒工作的案哪！」</p>
<p>答話的人，半似滑糟半似氣憤的回答，一面把挾在脅下的包袱，像拋掉那麼似的，丢在足下。</p>
<p>老頭子却不愛問的，只是頹唐地倒身睡了下去，臉上現出無可奈何的神情。</p>
<p>我記起一九三〇年的夏天了，也是這麼一個熱帶的早晨，獨個兒坐在吉隆坡的車站上，等候着去星加坡的快車也曾遇見好些押送歸國的失業工久，那狼狽的樣子，髒汚的衣衫，和響着丟那媽的廣東口音，正同現在看見的一般無二，不過人數還沒這麽多哩。（完）</p>
<h3>雨</h3>
<p>— 欽文</p>
<p>「久早逢甘雨，」這在農人是何等可喜的呀！但在社會上，也很有着不嫌久晴只怕下雨的人，就是一般黃包車夫，專靠遊客的舟子和小販等；他們並非不要雨水，只是地面一濕，遊人少了，不容易招致主顧，生活就起恐慌。</p>
<p>一般小姐太太和少爺公子們也要怨雨，因爲不便到門外去暢暢快快的遊嬉；也有些人會得站在超然地位贊賞雨，以爲是富有詩意的；不道都沒有切身的關係。其實農家，雖在久早以后，一方面喜歡雨的降下，同時也是苦雨的。</p>
<p>爲着驟然大雨，隨即綿綿的下個不了，路被冲壞，行不得車子，我曾在鄉間的一個農家逗留過些日子。房子並不多，變化可不少：有的是泥牆瓦屋頂，有的是草屋頂，也有是完全中草搭成的；却一樣是漏的。滴下着水的地方並非只有兩三處，東也的答的答，西也的答的答；風大的時候，雨絲斜射，也會得從窗洞壁縫里打進。日間倒還好，可以隨時行動避開；晚上搬眠床可費事，菜油燈的光太小，泥地上面處處積着水，走起路來濺脚跟；半夜工夫要搬三四回，眞是「屋漏偏遭連夜雨！」</p>
<p>只是這樣倒也罷了，門前有着埃圾堆，那里還並排着雨隻糞缸；雲悶天固然格外來得臭，這原是蒼蠅的大本營，一下雨就都飛到房子里來。有一天，因爲主人和幾個年紀大點的人都趁水漲捕魚去了，我替他們煮了一餐飯。柴也被雨漏濕了，很難燒着；好容易弄了熟，在將要吃的時候揭開鍋子蓋來一看，不由得嚇了一跳，以爲誰來偷放了一大把烏豆。仔細察看，才知道滿天星一般的原都是蒼蠅，已經同米一道煮熟了。</p>
<p>他們根據經騐說：這種地方燒飯，不應該早就合上鍋蓋，要到燒得鍋子中的水嗤嗤　了，才可以放下蓋子，還得先在蓋子的四周細細的敲一回，把停在那里的蒼蠅赶走。</p>
<p>只是把蒼蠅的屍體一個一個的撈出，那鍋子飯，仍然你一盌我一盌的大口吞嚥，速鍋巴也不曾剩下一塊。怕得吃壞肚子，我會主張把這些飯棄掉；主人大反對，說是在這種時候，灶上有米灶下有柴已經很難得，那里管得到什麽蒼蠅。這一幕給了我深刻的印象，雖然一起不過逗留得四天，在我的生活史中，却象占了很大的地位；如今一下雨，我就會得不期然而然回想到。其實過着這種生活的農人，何嘗只是我逗留過的一家。而且照那主人所說，這還算是好的。他對於我沒有說謊的必要，是的確的罷！</p>

<p>—他便這樣再說了好一會，直至我離開他。</p>
<p>以後我再沒有見他的面。過了幾天我又出門去，到外邦的一個大學裏去研究法律；本年之後，我的母親，她曾經聽我說起那次相遇的事，她就寫信吿訴我說：波力嘉先生，路易十六宮廷當爐官底孫子，也在黑十字架底下找得一個位置了。</p>
<p>三年之後我就到本邦大學裏讀書，照章在畢業考試之前我應當在這裏修業一年的。弗里茨次年秋天才要回來，過去一學期我就同他在海德堡一起住着。但我的朋友克里斯多夫倒已卒業了；他現在正在一個傢俱公司充當工頭。一天下午我在一個公園裏碰見他，他面前擺一杯啤酒，深思地坐着，嘴含一支雪茄，向前噴着烟。他的叢密的褐　和漂亮的服裝，使我走近他的近旁才把他認出來。當我默不作聲地把手放在他的肩上時候，他趕快把頭掉轉來並驕傲地看着我；因爲我現在雖然沒有戴有色情子，但我的模樣顯然是屬於他始終所不喜歡的「拉丁人」的。但他一經認出是我，便有一種十分高興的驚訝戀情從他眼裏露出來。「菲力，是你麽？」他說，一面帶着幾乎像小姑娘一的謙遜態度抓住我付給他的手並用力握着。—我把談了很長久的話，談到我們的故鄉，談到各人的父母，談到那些老朋友；當我提到那次不幸的溜冰事件時候，我就問起我們的共同的愛人底消息。</p>
<p>雷娜麗還在她親戚一個年老的女裁縫家裏住着，跟體她在本地一些高貴人家屋子裏做點針綫生意。但克里斯多夫回答這些問題時，是很勉强的，不願意多說，終於想法趕快把話頭轉到別的事情上面去了。他的誠實的性情似乎還給這美貌姑娘迷惑住，至於我，則我以爲早已把她的魔力連同故鄉塵土一起擺擺脫了。</p>
<p>我這個見解並不正確。—不久之後，我陪伴幾個有交情的貴婦人到大學城所在海灣底那一邊去，那裏當時是個衆人尋樂的地方。下午已經過完了，我們從海提上走下來，要趁回城的渡船。兩隻渡船差不多坐滿了，已經準備開動。在離我們三十步遠的一隻渡船旁邊，有個跛脚的老年女栽縫，我曾在房東底住房裏看見過她；在她旁邊又有一個非常美貌的姑娘站着。</p>

<p>電界之聲</p>
<h3>水災與電報</h3>
<p>— 楨</p>
<p>近來長江流域各省，霪雨兼旬，山洪暴發，致沿江一帶各埠之水位，超過二十年同日之紀錄。政府與人民。莫不注意防汎問題，電文紛馳，奔走呼顩，買爲目前最嚴重之問題。吾人若不能妥爲防範，消患無形，一旦堤垣潰决，掃湯千里，則人民生計，社會生存，民族生命，將隨洪濤巨波而莫知所屆。聞行政院已令飭交通鐵道兩部，對於水災之防禦與救濟通信上與運輸上之事宜，予以充分之便利，理應然也。</p>
<p>關於運輸事項，不屬本文範圍，茲不具論。關於通信事項，據吾人所知，交通部似已盡其能事，且正在設法，予救災或防汎團體種種便利。良以水流甚速，水勢甚猛，欲加防救，貴在迅速，常以一電傳遞之遲速，關係無數生命與無數財產。換言之，雖有千百人工與鉅萬財力，苟無通信上之述絡，决不能收防汎救災之效。</p>
<p>交通部曾經規定振務電報，凡經國民政府或各省政府核决立案之中國及外國振務圑體，因辦理臨時或特別急振，得發振務電報，此項電報，免費傳遞，交通部每年所費之人工與材料，爲數不貲。根據二十一年統計，振務電報，共有一百八十餘萬字，計報費十八萬餘元，完全免費。卽交通部每年須賠貼十八萬餘元之振務電報報費也。</p>
<p>此外尚有一種防汎電報，關於防汎機關，用其最高機關印電紙，發寄電報，或報告防汎工作，或報告水位高下，亦准免費。此項電報，交通部現已通飭沿江各局，無分晝夜，隨到隨發，隨收隨送，與人命安全電報，同其傳遞次序焉。</p>
<p>電信爲國營事業，對於防汎救災消息，自應提前傳遞，責無旁貸。然同此項電報之多而且急，其他各項電報，不得不稍爲壓後傳遞。如救火然，火災地點之交通車輛，不得不停片時，先讓救火車之風馳電駛也。又各地電報桿綫，多被大水冲毀，無法通報，非俟水勢退至相當程度時，不能修理，猶之鐵路公路，被水衝斷，或淹沒，非俟水退時，無法通車也。故近來各地電報，間有遲到情事，實非電局辦事不力之咎。惟通商大埠，均有無綫電設備，卽今有綫電路完全阻斷，當可利用無綫電通報。但以一時報務甚忙，機器容量有限，終不免於擁擠。此係電報受水災之影響，情形特殊，應請社會人士原諒者也。</p>
<p>抑有進者：各電報局對於水災電報，提前傳遞，以公言之，固在救濟公衆，以私言之，亦係救濟本身。若防汎機關，因電報傳遞迅速，得以及早防禦，則市面與農村，不受水災損失，社會經濟能力，得以保持，電政收入，自然可觀，此一說也。若防汎機關得電信消息，及時搶險，則電桿不致冲斷，電局不致浸淫，報務得以暢通，此又一說也。準此言之，全國人士，能就本身立塲，對於防汎救災之事，認明責任，則人定勝天，雖災而不害矣。</p>
<h3>今後之電話業務</h3>
<p>— 驊</p>
<p>交通部年來對於改進電信事業之政策，完全以公衆利益爲前提。凡一切有利於公衆之設施，殆莫不力謀推進，以期公衆享用之普通。在電報方面：如改訂收報人姓名住址收費辦法，免費査問電報，電話收發電報等等，本刋已詳爲介紹，俾讀者知所利用。在電話方面：交部於最近公佈之市內電話營業通則內，復有種種便利公眾業務之規定，各地話局，卽將按照該項通則，分別實施。今後之電話業務，將有劃時期的發展，蓋可斷言。記者爰不憚費詞，謹就市内電話營業通則中規定之各項業務，約略述之於後，幸讀者注意之。</p>
<p>夫商品之出售，欲求推銷之暢利，必先具備價廣之條件。吾國市內電話所以不發達之原因，雖其道多端，但電話租費之價目，不能適合一般國民經濟，要爲重要原因之一。故除少數商戶必須裝用者外，尚難期普遍的利用。而話局方面，以各項開支之浩繁，原定租費，亦難再减。交部有鑒於此，除已於各電報收發處或郵政支局內，設置公用電話，以利各界外，復於市內電話營業通則內規定辦理合用電話業務，以資通話。此項業務之創辦，完全爲住宅用戶節省話費而設。卽用戶二家以上，得共同聲請用同一話機，在電話號碼簿內分別列名，其每戶租費，依普通話費折减計算。如二戶六折，三戶五折，四戶四折。按照首都電話局住宅電話所定租費每月八元計算，則四戶合用電話一具，每戶每月祇攤洋三元二角，可謂廉矣。</p>
<p>按合用電話業務，大抵爲便利合宅用戶而設。至一般異宅用戶，欲得减價利益者，則營業通則內又有同綫電話之規定，可資利用。所謂同綫電話，卽二家以上之異宅用戶，在同一綫路上裝設話機。其每戶租費，亦依普通電話租費折减計算。如二戶八折，三戶七折，四戶六折，因同綫電話，須供給多架話機，並須在話局方面，裝置特別設備，以免呼叫混淆，故所訂租費，略較合用電話爲高。聞上海電話局卽將開辦此項業務，以利用戶。</p>
<p>查裝置電話之用戶。往往爲鄰居代接電話，不勝其擾。如一律加以拒絕，似為人情所不許。尤以主人因出外旅行，或其他事故，不常在家時，來話無人接應，每易發生誤曾。爲避免用戶此種煩惱起見，營業通則內復訂定用戶暫時無須使用電話時，得通知話局暫停接綫、或將該機撤回，保留電話號碼，待需用時再行恢復通話。暫撤期內，如有人與該用戶通話，並由話局將其姓名住址及通話日期時間加以記錄，於恢復通話時通知用戶。交部對於用戶設想之週到，可謂無微不至。</p>
<p>此外，各地如有運動會展覽會或其他事故須臨時裝用電話者，復有臨時電話之規定，祇須繳納裝費及租費，母須預存保證金。船舶停泊碼頭時，須裝用電話者，又訂有碼頭電話辦法，可與市內電話接綫通話。凡此種種，俱爲便利公衆之設施，而尤値得吾人注意者，厥爲裝機期限之明白規定。卽話局接到用戶請求後，除因工程不便，棧路不順，或缺乏空號空綫者，得酌量情形，以書面述明理由分別緩裝或拒絕外，至遲須於五日內發出允裝通知書，並於收淸各費後十日內將機裝就，俾用戶無久待之煩，而一般用戶願繳一季或數季租費者，並得享减價之利益，以示優待，是誠電話業務上非常之改進也。</p>
<h3>國際電台印象記</h3>
<p>— 丁海濤</p>
<p>前言記者久耳我國際電台之設施完善，管理新穎，亟思前往參觀，以資借鏡，然苦無機綠，償我夙願，茲以上月下旬，因事赴滬，乃竟一日之力，對於該台各部，加以實地考察，當由該台業務主任胡命諟，收發長王世新兩先生，股勤接待，詳加指導，予以便利，深爲感荷，所得印象之佳，求諸國營事業中，實不多覯，爰泚筆爲記，以饗本刊讀者。</p>
<p>中央收發室之性質—國際電台，爲近世最新科學設備，是以通訊機件，力求完善，以期工作通暢，爲避免干擾，增高速率起見，除裝置各種新式機器外，復採用遙控制通訊方法，將收發報台，遠置上海市外劉行，眞茹，楓林橋等三處，而以鎧甲電纜，分別接至中央收發室，俾資控制，舉凡報務之收發，營業之處理，均由該處集中辦理，換言之，中央收發室，猶人之大腦，各市收發報台，如其耳目，一舉一動，均受其主宰，息息相通，運用靈便，說者謂中央收發室之報務，先傳至眞茹或楓林橋發報台，再行轉發，殊非事實，此種揣測之辭，當爲識者所不取，社會人士幸勿誤會。</p>
<p>中央收發室之設置與運用—國際電台中央收發室，位於仁記路沙遜大厦二樓，地點適中，交通便利，室作長方形，於中央裝有馬達輸送皮帶，兩旁則羅列各種新式波紋機，與高速度自動發報機，鍵盤鑿孔機，打字機等，幷標誌各直達通報地點，易於矚目，復留有寬敞之走道，使無肩摩踵接之虞，室之盡端，置有整流擴大等應用之機件，使劉行收報台收下之信號電流，於鎧甲電纜傳至中央收發室後，得以穩定。波紋收報機上，自可顯出明晣之符號，以供値機員之抄錄。馬達輸送皮帶之一端，設有來報登記員席，使各機所抄下之外洋來報，可就自動輸送之簡捷，减去稽延。登記員之對面，則爲派送與分發兩員席，使其工作得以互相銜接。再進爲一玻璃房間，除備有電傳打字機，直接與各中外商行通報外，幷裝有電話多部，派專員職司話送，樓上報房，與樓下收發處，則藉氣壓管Pneumatic　tube，以傳遞報務，瞬息可達，極爲靈便。</p>
<p>總收發處之情形—總收發處位於中央收發室之樓下，大門面仁記路，而於沙遜大厦內，闢有邊門，玻窗上，髹以各種直達電路之金字，且於門首裝有霓紅市招，光耀奪目。入內櫃檯作長形，計分日文，國外，國內，訊問，等部。各有專員職司，應對週到。値班收報員，幷有號碼，標誌於外，以示負責。壁間繪以黑地彩色世界各國直達通報地名表，雜以五彩電燈，相映成趣。其設施與管理，極爲科學化與藝術化，該台之所以博得社會好評，良有已也。</p>
<p>國際電台之組織—該台爲國營唯一自主對外通訊機關，是以組織上，自應力求完備。關於該台工作人員之支記。諒爲各界所欲知，茲探誌如下。</p>
<p>管理工程師　一人　總攬全台工務業務</p>
<p>業務主任　一人　掌管全台報務與營業</p>
<p>報務長　一人　管理報務</p>
<p>收發長　一人　管理營業</p>
<p>主任收發員　數人　負責收發上之責任</p>
<p>主任業務稽査員　一人　稽査業務上之事項</p>
<p>業務稽査員　數人　仝上</p>
<p>工務主任　一人　掌管全台工務</p>
<p>工程師　數人　辦理工務</p>
<p>事務主任　一人　掌管全台事務</p>
<p>國際電台直達通報地名—該台自民十七年創始，因業務逐漸增繁，先後從事於直達電路之開放，迄今已蔚爲巨觀，舉凡世界各名城，無不直接與該台通報，茲探錄各通報地名如下：</p>
<p>一、中美路（舊金山合組公司電路）二、中美路（舊金山馬凱公司電路）三、中德路（柏林）四、中法路（巴黎）五、中俄路（莫斯科）六、中瑞路（日內瓦）七、中英路（倫敦）八、中菲路（馬尼刺）九、中越路（西貢）十、中荷路（巴達維亞）十一、中日路（東京）十二、滬港路（香港）十三、中意路（羅馬）</p>
<p>國際電台設施上之優點—記者於參觀該台時，對於　各部份之設施，曾作翔實之觀察，茲就個人所得印象，歸納言之，約有下列數點：</p>
<p>（甲）該台報房佈置井井有條，人員支配異當　當，其主管人員調度有方，値得稱許，全部工作人員，絕少吸烟，談話，等習慣，個個埋頭苦幹，精神飽滿，尤屬可嘉。</p>
<p>（乙）司電話傳遞之女職員，發音淸晣，辦事敏捷，殊足予收蕟報人以良好印象。</p>
<p>（丙）收發處佈置簡潔，工作人員舉動靈敏，服裝亦整齊端方，確屬難能可貴。</p>
<p>（丁）該台工作均採用最新式波紋收報機，高速度自動發報機，鍵盤鑿孔機等。是以來往電報，均有紙條，及顯明符號，且派有校對員，隨時校正各種紙條報底故絕無錯誤發生。</p>
<p>國際電台營業上之新猷—記者於參觀各部完竣後，復以私人資格，與該台收發長王世新君，作友誼上之談話。藉以咨詢今後之營業計劃，據其表示，除該台已實行電話收發電報，及全市各郵電局代收電報以外，已採用派人收取電報之辦法，備有機器脚踏車，派英語流利之收報員，隨時應發報人之請求，前往收取，携台拍發。此項辦法，自創行以來，各界極稱便利，是亦該台服務社會之新猷，殊値慶幸者也。</p>
<p>記者意見—上海一地，華洋雜處，爲東亞商業重心，拍發外洋電報，幾佔全國各處之半數，然考該台之收入，尚未達到相當之比率。以記者愚見，此固由於外商水綫公司，有其根深蒂固之攸久歷史，然各界未能充分明瞭該台之設施與立塲，面收通力合作之功效，似爲主因。今後各界，應本其「愛用國貨」之熱衷，羣起與該台合作，如有改進意見，儘可隨時提供該台主管人員之參考，各服務洋行之華職員，亦應盡其良心上之主張，以助該台之發展。是爲記者馨香祝禱者也。</p>
<h3>報差送報之昔觀</h3>
<p>— 巨鰲</p>
<p>近年以來，交通當局，對於電信業務之改進，可謂不遺餘力。無論機械·組織。管理。各方面，均有進步，而其目的，莫不着眼於「增高速率」與便利民衆諸點，本刋迭有記載，母待贅述，茲所陳者，乃平時不爲人重視，而實際則於電報速率有莫大之關係者。其事維何？曰：報差投送電報辦法之切實整頓是也。</p>
<p>往昔報差投送來電，電局方面，旣不爲之劃分區域，規定時限，而每次投送電報份數，尤漫無限制。至報差送報成績如何？對於收報人禮貌如何？尤不加以査考。他若需索酒力等等，亦未嚴行取締。職是之故，電報旣不免因之延誤，而外界對於電局之印象亦隨之而惡劣。當局有鑒及斯，遂於本年一月一日有整頓投送來電辦法之頒行，茲錄其大要如次：</p>
<p>（一）各局台應將送報區域分爲若干區，報差每次出出勤所帶電報，以屬於同區及隣接之區者爲限，並須限時回局，以每區往返及每電遞交時刻，一併計算。其電報較多之商行·機關·或私人，在可能範圍內，指定專差投送，限時回局</p>
<p>（二）各局台報差排値班務，須參照照每日報務繁簡情形，及所有報差人數，妥爲支配，以報務繁忙時多派人手，報務淸簡時，少派人手爲原則。至報差每次送報，最多以三封爲限。</p>
<p>（三）各局台主管人員，應用下列方法，晝夜抽査報差送報成績，以及有無需索酒資情事，其來報特別繁多之局台，酌設稽査差，專司其事：</p>
<p>甲，電話査詢於報差出局台後，以電話請求收報人，於報差送達某號電報時，將送達時刻通知。</p>
<p>乙，實地査詢於報差出發後，隨卽騎乘自行車馳往收報人處，査詢送到時刻。</p>
<p>上述辦法，施行以來，業經半載，送報速率，確有提高，而需索酒力之風，殆已絕跡。此爲社會人士所共知，無待記者辭費者也。惟是此項辦法之施行，有賴於社會人士合作之處者頗多，吾人於此，謹掬誠提出兩事，希各界予以注意爲幸：査電報回單之上，印有「收到時間」一項，此項時間，係爲稽核報差送報有無躭延而設，務請收報人於收電時切實簽註，以便査考。其一。再査報差出局送報，時間均有限定，送報不止一封，務請收報人勿予無故滯留報差，以免躭誤他人電報，及連累報差逾限回局，得受處分。此其二，凡此二點，於收報人方面並無不便，而於電局稽査方面着想，實有莫大帮助。此吾人區區冀望之忱也。</p>
<h3>江南鐵路各站代收代送電報</h3>
<p>— 記者</p>
<p>江南公司主辦南京至宣城之江南鐵路，業經通車，交通部爲便利沿路民衆通信起見，在該路未與電報局接綫通報以前，准由蕪湖電報局委託該路各車站代收代送電報，訂定辦法，自七月一日起試辦。凡各站民衆所發之電報，除中華門，采石，當塗，蕪湖，宣城五站所收者，逕交當地電局轉遞外，應用電話傳遞至上開各站，再交電局投送或轉遞。其由電局發往各站之報，亦交由上開各站用電話轉遞投送。惟代收代發之電，暫以國內尋常電及加急電爲限。至所收報費，照電局定章辦理，如收報人住址離站過遠者，得酌收送力，亦照電局專力費章程收付。此外對於民衆，絕無任何另加費之徵收也。</p>
<p>而在電局方面，須付每電之手續費（尋常電華明二分，華密或洋文四分。加急電華明四分，華密或洋文八分）於路方，故所得報費，僅有八成，其餘二成，爲路局之手續費。此項手續費，在路局已與電局訂有接綫合同時，卽爲過綫費。去年三月以前，所有各國有鐵路車站代收代送電報之過綫費，歸收發報民衆繳付。換言之，收發報民衆於繳付普通報費之外，尚須繳二成過綫費，殊非便利通信之道。交通部特規定自二十三年三月份起，將鐵路電報應付路局之過棧費，卽在報費項下貼付，不再向收發報人收取，此於交通部每年雖受相當損失，苟有利於民衆，亦所不計也。</p>
<p>夫各種交通事業，各有其功效，然苟無通信上之聯絡，决難顯其功效之偉大，甚或前途有莫大之危險，而不知預防。故凡鐵路，公路，飛機，及船舶，必須有電信設備，然後其效益宏。猶之人然，鐵路，公路，飛機及船舶如四肢，電信如脈絡也。</p>
<p>江南鐵路，裝有電話設備，固已成爲現代化之交通系統。今與電報局訂定代收代送電報辦法，不獨該路乘客及車站附近民衆，得通信上之便利，卽該路本身，已與全國各種交通機關聯成一氣，將來該路業務之發達，殊未可限量，而交通部主辦之電信事業，亦隨之而深入沿路各地矣。</p>
<h3>車站設置公用電話</h3>
<p>— 仲賢</p>
<p>交通部爲便利旅客通訊起見，曾决定於各鐵路車站設置郵電代理處，關於郵政電報部份，業已先由上海郵政管理局及上每電報局，分別逕與京滬滬杭甬鐵路管理局商定辦法，先於兩路渪綫各車站試辦，關於公用電話一節，自經交通部决定在京滬滬杭甬鐵路沿綫各車站先行試辦，並令飭上海電話局就近與路局接洽辦理，　經磋商，始會同擬就「京滬滬杭甬兩路沿綫車站供給公用電話地位暫行辦法」一種，由電話局及路局分別呈請交通部鐵道部核示，當經交鐵兩部先後令飭准予試辦在案。現在京滬滬杭甬兩路沿綫各車站所在地點，業已設有交通部電話局者，爲首都，上海，蘇州，鎭江，等四處，各該處電話局均已奉令逕與當地車站接洽設置公用電話零售處，不久當可成爲事實。又兩路沿綫各車站所在地點，業已設有民營電話公司者，爲無錫，常州，崑山，嘉與，松江，嘉善，硤石，楓涇等八處。設有省辦電話局者，杭州一處。交通部亦已分別令飭各該處電話公司，並咨請浙江省政府依據上項暫行辦法逕與當地車站商洽設置公用電話零售處，在最短期間內，亦將逐漸見諸實行。車站郵電代理處之設置，可謂已告完成。從此旅客抵車站後，偶因急事需要發電寄信，或與親友家屬通記者，均可随時交由車站垂電代理處發寄，或利用公用電話就近通話，非常便利！</p>
<p>車站郵電代理處之設置，確予旅客以莫大之便和。尤以公用電話零售處之設備，爲一般旅客所急切需要。蓋一般熙來攘往之旅客，往往於行色忽忙時，遺忘重要物件，或至車站後始憶及尚有要事要言，須向親友或家屬交代囑付，如欲重行離站往取，或與親友叙談者，因火車開行在卽，實爲時間月不許。老毅然不顧而行，則難免貽誤事機。倘堅欲折回，勢必因躭延時刻，有誤行程。又如與親友數人同往某地，約定某時在車站會齊，屆時設有一人竟未按時蒞站，則同行之人，無不爲之心中焦急。現在車站旣已設有公用電話零售處，偶遇有上項情事，均可立卽利用通話解决，卽使家中未裝電話，亦可接至鄰近裝有市內電話之親友家中託其轉告，此車站公用電話便利旅客之一端也。</p>
<p>其次，吾人自甲地至乙地時，如因擭帶行李過多，或因乙地親友住址所在地點，不甚熟悉，須由乙地親友於火車到埠時蒞站迎接者，祇能事前用快函或發電通知對方，庶不致誤。然車站設有公用電話以後，吾人如素知乙地親友家中已裝有市內電話，或鄰近電話可以借打者，則儘可俟火車到達乙地車站時打一電話，手續更爲簡捷。此亦車站公用電話爲旅客服務之一端也。</p>
<p>至於旅客乘車到達某地後，如有急要事項，亟欲與其親友會談者，一俟火車到達某地車站時，卽可使用公用電話與親友通話，約定會唔之時間及地點，尤屬便利。其他如抵車站後欲問熟悉之車行僱用汽車等事項，均可就近通話接洽。再報館外勤記者在車站採訪新聞或報告時人行蹤，均可利用公用電話隨時與報館通話，亦頗迅捷。於此可見車站公用電話之效用，極爲廣大，不僅便利旅客而已。</p>
<h3>修訂員工調派川資表之意義</h3>
<p>— 德</p>
<p>電信員工，凡過調派時，例得照章支領川旅費用。惟此項川資表，尚係民國十二年北京交通部所釐訂，距今十有餘年，不僅各地情形，今昔大殊，卽近年來各省公路建設，突飛猛晉，交通狀况，幾有一日千里之勢，故前訂川資表，已不合實用，每過員工調派時，自甲地至乙地，究應發給川資若干？輙苦無一定標準，因此各局有呈部請示者，有由起程局先發若干，再由到達局呈部核銷者，間亦有由部飭令管理局就近杏覆者，情形不一，彼此互殊，非特辦法歧異，承辦者時感困難，而案牘紛繁，稽延時日，亦易誤事機。最近部中有見及是，决將川資表重行修訂，以求適合於目前之交通狀况。</p>
<p>修訂川資表，手續極爲繁複，蓋全國報話局台約計不下一千數百餘處，各地問交通工具，約可分爲火車，汽車，輪船，帆船，以及舊式驟，馬，車，轎，等數種，究竟何地通用何種或兼用幾種交通工具？自甲地至乙地行程日期及川資，各需若干？必須一一調查淸楚，始能加以詳確之規定。</p>
<p>進行步驟共分：（一）調査，（二）審核，（三）修訂。第一步先着手調査工作，飭令各管理局査覆該省區內各局台間之交通狀况，以便製繪地圖。（用各色綫條代表鐵路，公路，水路，陸路等）同時並向各省公路汽車管理機關，各鐵路局，以及國營招商局等分別索取汽車，火車，輪船，價目及時刻表，俾資參攷。第二步俟各管理局呈覆到部以及各項價目時刻表彙齊後，再一一加以審核。第三步分別訂定鐵路，公路，省區川資表三種。蓋自甲地至乙地需川資若干？乙地至丙地需川資若干？甲地至丙地川資又需若干？循此類推，則全國各局台間之互相往來川資，其繁複可想而知，故須分別規定，以資簡明。</p>
<p>此項川資表自經訂定以後，不但辦法統一，可資遵循，如遇發給川資或査核冊報時，均有一定標準，不必再轉輾査詢，多費周折，卽就减少核覆川旅費公文而言，亦能於無形中提高工作效率。記者竊謂此項工作，雖屬繁瑣，要亦我電政上刷新工作之一也。</p>
<h3>電報工務組織上之革新</h3>
<p>— 粤</p>
<p>電報綫路，自民國十八年以後，分爲幹支兩種。幹綫設工務處以修養之，支綫則歸各電報局修養。計先後成立幹綫工務處凡十。曰：滬漢，（卽上海漢口綫），滬一關（卽上海福州綫），靑滬（卽上海靑島綫），津浦（卽天津浦口綫），福廣（卽福州廣州綫），漢平（卽漢口北平綫），漢渝（卽漢口巴縣綫），烟濟（卽烟亳濟南綫），平楡（卽北平二連棧及北平臨楡綫），廣邕（卽廣州邕寗綫），直隸於交通部，其餘由各局修養之支綫，則屬電政管理局。茲聞交部以劃一管理起見，卽將各幹綫工務處，自七月分起，一律裁撤，不分幹支各綫，悉歸各局修養，統屬於電政管理局。並於蘇，浙，閩，皖，贛，鄂，湘，豫，冀，魯，川，黔，等省電政管理局中，加派工務員，分區指導各局修養及改善綫路事宜。計蘇省劃分四區，分駐工務員於南京，上海，仙女廟，淮陰等局。浙省二區，分駐於杭州，蘭谿等局。閩省三區，分駐於一福州，浦城，厦門等局。皖省三區，分駐於懷寗，蕪湖，蚌埠等局。贛省三區，分駐於南昌，九江，臨川等局。鄂省三區，分駐於漢口，沙市，老河口等局。湘省三區，分駐於長沙，衡陽，洪江等局。豫省二區，分駐於鄭縣，許昌，等局。冀省三區，分駐於北平，天津，石家莊等局。魯省三區，分駐於濟南，靑島，烟臺等局。川省四區，分駐於巴縣，萬縣，成都，瀘縣等局。黔省二區，分駐于貴陽，畢節等局，以期周密。其原定綫工例巡綫路（卽每十日或五日出巡一次）辦法，亦卽于七月分起停止舉行。改組巡査隊巡査綫路，視綫路之重要或次要，以定巡査之次數。重要綫路，每月巡査一次，次要者每二個月巡査一次，巡査隊之組緞，仍以原有綫工三至五人，雇用小工五人至八人，由工頭率領，携帶相當材料，按時巡査。其巡査段落，由工務員就近規定之。巡査隊一隊至少有九人，若在中途發見桿綫之不良狀態，卽可隨時整理，雖巡視綫路之機會較少，其效率或較各個綫工每月例巡數次爲佳也。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>犯罪者之勞動公社</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>消滅犯罪的傾向，應用感化，而不應用懲罰。老子有言：「民不畏死，奈何以死懼之？」一個人當給生活環境迫得無法生存，什麼天大的事都敢作。雖法律森嚴，亦所不畏。故近今歐美一部份心理學家犯罪學家及社會學家，對於消滅犯罪的行爲，大都主張採用感化政策。蓋感化的力量，遠勝於任何嚴重的懲罰。</p>
<p>據我們所知道，現在世界各文明法治國家，爲實施感化政策起見，無不有感化院的創設。但這種戚化院，只收容一般未成年的兒童犯，尙未能普及於所有的犯罪者。這不免是一個缺陷。這大槪是因爲人們認爲兒童個性未定，此成年人易於受感化的原故。</p>
<p>聞社會主義國家的蘇俄，威化院而外，尙有一種犯罪者勞動公社的組織。這種公社，對於犯人，不用禁閉方式，且不用壓迫或懲罰。他們純用教育工作，消滅其犯罪的傾向。在蘇俄，全國共有十四個勞動公社，其中以波爾希伏公社爲最著名。波爾希伏公社成立迄今，已有十年。當成立之初，僅有犯人十八名，而現時已增至三千一百人。工塲的設備，最初亦只有木匠工塲修理鞋靴工塲及鎖匙工塲。今日則有編織廠及運動器具製造廠。目前這個公社，已發展成一小城。內部並無法警，管理這三千一百名社員的室外工作者，僅有六位管理人而已。這要有巨大的建築，有會議廳，有健身房，有電影院。文化與教育工作，在公社中，最爲重要。全體社員均須受教育。每一社員，規定留此三年。但大多數社員，皆願終身居住於此。若干過去的社員，現今在各鄉鎭服務，業巳無罪。現任公社副經理及社會工作指導者，巳往亦爲他們的同伴。</p>
<p>蘇俄這種犯罪者勞動公社的設立，和普通的監獄制度，顯然大有分別。前者對於囚犯，施用教育工作，以消滅其犯罪的行爲。後者則應用懲罰的方法，以儆戒犯罪者的再度犯法。從表面上看，勞動公社比監獄放任得多，似乎不足以改變犯人的犯罪傾向。但就成績而言，前者實較後者爲優。蓋改善囚徙的行爲，最適當的辦法，無過於採用感化政策，若一味施行懲罰，則收效甚微。這是近來許多犯罪學者所公認的事實。</p>
<h3>搶</h3>
<p>— 斯全</p>
<p>午後，太陽像一盆火，覆在人們的頭頂上，但是直角鎭里的人不敢在屋子里偷懶，田爿里那些蠕動着的大凉帽底下都有着一張失了人性底紫黑的臉呵！</p>
<p>到鎭上去的大道上，地層裂了痕，太陽光就不肯放鬆地射進地層去。拖着血紅舌頭的野狗，像一個病人那樣地躺在樹蔭下喘氣，肚下的肋骨一起一伏掀動着，或許牠三天沒有嚼到一根骨頭了：不，一堆屎。</p>
<p>遠遠地却走來一個人，斯文地，那種踱方步的樣子恐怕是這條大道開闢以來第一次的發見吧。是城里人，穿着綢質的長袍，有一頂好看的凉帽，自然手中更有一柄輕搖的紙扇。作一個不甚適合的比喻，或者那是個吟詩的書獃子。</p>
<p>他走過野狗躺着的大樹時，彷彿像一個偷猪賊一樣，曲下他的背樑，箭似的射進福生伯的屋子里。</p>
<p>福生伯沒有到田里去，他害着病，思念兒子得症的。他有孝順的兒子，今年桃花開放的時侯，害了一塲觀音堂里的仙方都不能醫治的重病。祇十來天，一個單手能够挺一百斤重擔的漢子被二個孩子抬到野地葬了。兩個孫兒年紀還輕，他們挑不起父親掉下來的擔子，就送到城里去學生意。福生伯心里是不願意這樣做，至少老頭兒還沒有到不生產的時侯，但是他害病了：兩個孩子的吃口要大過他們的父親，媳婦就沒有徵求他的同意送進城了。</p>
<p>禍不單行，福無雙至，福生伯並不在他的名字上佔得一點光，兒子死後沒有過七，佃主張大爺的管阿興來勢兇兇）地要收回地面。</p>
<p>「你兒子死了，你這把年紀還能種田？老爺的田是重價買進來的，荒了你老命都不够抵償，快些把紙契拿出來！老爺特別開恩，去年的欠租送了你。」</p>
<p>張大爺的話從來沒有打過折扣，田面是收回了，可是欠租沒有開恩贈送，阿興不時要像那野狗似的叫到福生伯的屋子里來的。</p>
<p>福生伯想起了自家底倒霉運氣，不免在床上長吁短嘆。他希望他的孫兒長大起來，有父親一樣的膂力，把張大爺，阿興踩一個肉團子。可是張大爺有靈性的，他巳立在福生伯的床前了。福生伯睜開老花的眼睛，他希望是個夢，但是張大爺巳經坐到他的床前來了，那張永遠拉長着的臉上，今天却意外地裝着一絲笑容。福生伯慌得不知怎樣才好，他想喊他的媳婦，煮一碗茶或是什麼的，張大爺親自下鄉，這禍事就闖得太大了。</p>
<p>「福生，你不認識我張大爺嗎？我來瞧瞧你的病。」張大爺高大的嗓子壓得那樣低弱，在他却反是用足了氣力的。</p>
<p>「不敢當……」福生伯想從床上撑起來向張大爺叩幾個頭，「不敢當，張老爺！我實在爬不起來…那欠租過幾天我自己送來，張老爺……」</p>
<p>張老爺却搶來說了：「我希罕這幾個錢！我是來瞧瞧你病，阿興說你想兒子病倒了。眞可憐，那樣年紀輕輕地！」似乎是戚歎，又忽然想到似的：「你家媳婦呢？」</p>
<p>「是的。大狗娘，張老爺在這里，煮杯茶來！」福生伯竭力喊着。</p>
<p>「不忙，不忙！」張大爺用手掩上福生伯的嘴，更細聲地，「我想同你商量，顯生，媳婦兒年紀輕輕養在家里也不是個路道，前鎭阿陸的兒子想娶媳婦，你有這個意思嗎？你欠我的租就作爲聘禮。」說到末了張大爺又拉長了臉。福生伯想說什麼還沒有開口，大爺又拍拍他的肩頭：</p>
<p>「自家年紀這般大了，病着也不請個醫生，我這里有五塊錢，你先拿去用。」他見福生伯並不伸手出來，那個善變的魔術家又放寬了喉嚨，「別不識抬舉，連你的欠租也三十元出關了。聽着，阿陸今天晚來要人的！」</p>
<p>花綠的鈔票像一顆子彈似的擊着福生伯的胸膛，張大爺曲着背溜出了他的屋子，像一個偷猪賊。</p>
<p>當天晚上，福生伯媳婦兒被搶了，一張張失了人性底紫黑的臉一個大屏風似的圍在病床前，他們要當夜進城去告知張大爺，請張老爺定阿陸那傢伙「强搶孤孀」的罪名…</p>
<p>但是福生伯搖搖手，他嘆了最後一口氣。</p>
<h3>戰塲</h3>
<p>— 朱養晦作</p>
<h3>拿着了文憑</h3>
<p>— 戈</p>
<p>在報章上讀得招生廣告的時候，親愛的同學們，我知道你們已經歡天喜地捧着文憑投到母親的懷抱中了。但是記着，這是最後一次，所以我卽使不想殺風景地來談「畢業卽失業」問題；也想探問親愛的同學們，拿着了文憑之後，你們想做些什麼？</p>
<p>如果你們的父母有繼續供給你們求</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>學的費用，那末一切不生問題，在炎炎的暑假之後，你們依舊離別了母親的懷抱，繼績升大學，或者到國外去以求深造，雖然終究有戴上方帽子及學成歸國的日子，對於「想做些什麽？」的問題倒底是可以擱上一擱的。</p>
<p>親愛的同學們，於是這個問題是放到你們要「出而問世」者的肩頭來了。請你吿訴我，想做些什麽？</p>
<p>你們自然有許多偉大的志願，像你們畢業論文上所說的。這是不錯的，志願是一條軌道，祗要你們努力前進，終有一天做到你們所希望那樣偉大。但是這軌道在學校裏的時侯是平坦的，或許你們可以一眼望到那裏燦爛的前程，在社會上，這軌道却是荊棘叢生，要使你們堅苦的精神完全白白浪費，因爲你們在沒有走完十分之一的路程之前，或許巳經不濟事了！</p>
<p>親愛的同學們，你們好像沒有聽見過這樣令人嘔氣的話：書本上沒有讀到，你們的師長也沒有警吿過你們。那末，我來吿訴你：某雜誌舉行過一次「謀生的經過」的徵文，（「謀生」或許在你的「宏願」中沒有談到的，但是你們的父母是相從你們的身上收一點成本了！」許多靑年都說他們在五六年之間換了十來個職業，而沒有一次是感到滿意的。我想如果第二次應徵，他們一定說換了二十來個職業，而且是每况愈下了。</p>
<p>你們還是懷疑？時間是不讓人的，你們的黄金夢是應該醒來的時候了。那時候我想，親愛的同學們，一定很驚異嗎？於是，你們放棄了「宏願」的企圖，單單顧慮着每天要裝到那個餓肚子裏去的麵包問題了。但是這裏却又是一塊用紅字寫着的警吿牌呵—「人浮於事！」</p>
<p>你們當然驚駭得發昏了，你們以爲這個社會與學校是在兩個世界中的。你們知道救濟農村是需要人才，振興實業是需要人才，什麽科學，敎育……都是需要人才，現在怎樣一下子就人才過剩了呢？這個謎就把換了十來個職業的靑年混得團團轉了。</p>
<p>歸根結底，又是談到殺風景的「畢業卽失業」問題了。但是，親愛的同學們，你們不要嘔氣，應該理智一點，這個社會非但沒有人才過剩，而且是逼切地需要着人才，所以我希望你們拿着了文憑之後，先要想一想「做些什麽？」目光雖然可以放得遠一點，但是基礎却要在你們脚下打起，跨大步是要栽斛斗的！</p>
<p>親愛的同學們，恕我嘮叨，祝福你們都達到畢業論文上的宏願！微茫</p>
<h3>從稿紙想起</h3>
<p>— 微茫</p>
<p>每當把稿紙披開來的時候，心中便有大堆的思潮洶湧着。想着利用着稿紙來發表心中的思想，或做社會和人生世態的紀錄的，雖爲時不久，却也並非十分短暫。到現在，由稿紙所關聯的社會關係或朋友關係雖然是漸漸擴大了，然而同時隨之俱來的黑影也漸漸加大，而令人對當初的希望和鮮明味隨之失掉。文章是變成商品了，製造文章的人也只好變成一種商業社會的機件。於是商業社會所必有的黑暗，和各種令人憎厭的經騐，也便在自己的人生經騐上彙積起來。於是一滴墨水不只是代表一點心血，有是且會恐怖地想做是一點生活的汚點。到現在，文筆生活旣是剝不開，除不掉，且更日以穩固和堅牢，而令人對自己的前途，更充滿着憎厭和恐怖。</p>
<p>是的，稿紙是一種支票，一種堆上烏鴉便變成爲換錢的工具。然而人，除了在白紙上塗黑字，零碎地販賣着自己所有的狭隘的智識，或把熱情去欺騙自己的理智，還去欺騙他人之外，人果不能恃別的東西或別的工作去維持自己的生命麽？人果要把時間和精力，耗費在筆尖和紙上，而不去應用在其他的更有用和更有力的事業上麽？人果要吃着自己榨出來的心血，而又去騙取他人的同情和眼淚麽？如果社會是眞要壓迫一種人去從事文人的事業，那社會是固然有點可笑，而人也太渺小的了。</p>
<p>許多時來常常聽起文人對於自己的訊咒，或甚至把文人的筆和紙譬爲娼妓賣笑的工具。這說法固然有值得批判之處，因爲古往今來的著作者和其著作物，未必完全沒有價值，或對於人類社會完全沒有裨益之處，然而無疑的是許多白紙上堆上的黑字，未必張張有用，字字珠璣，則文人由腦筋所產生的產物，豈非比工人或農人的產品更爲不值錢，更當鄙視。然而人一把文人視爲為職業，則稿紙固然成爲一種支票，而文字也離開了本身所有的價值，而單純地成爲商品了。欲文人之不咀咒自己，其如現實何？</p>
<p>况且文人旣成爲一種專門的職業，而每種職業都各有她的黑暗和汚點的。於是文壇上之有黑暗，乃是勢所必然的了。說文塲如商塲，或文塲如官塲的必被人所痛恨，也是理有固然的了。</p>
<p>更可憐的是文人多半手無縛鷄之力，鋤頭旣拿不起，鋸子的使用又學不成：算盤不會打，槍機也不會開。要放棄這行業而做一點更有實際效用的工作吧？人家旣不要，自己也不能。那只好守株待兎，在狹隘的圈子內翻筋斗，而終其生於貧窮和抑　中過日子了。</p>
<p>在中國，稿紙雖然也巳成了支票，却尤其是不值錢的。書店老關的剝削，和社會需要的低微，使一千字至多賣成三塊和五塊，也已使你寫得手痠和頭痛了，則其生產旣於人民無益，也於自己不值得看起。欲人看重稿紙，也是難了。</p>
<p>所以，每當把稿紙披起，而筆鋒正預備向紙上進行的時候，這些思緒是常常攪得人低沈下心思，而廢然地又把稿紙摺疊起來，棄之一角的。一直靜待到餓着肚皮的時候，才又不得不用着千鈞的重力，把筆在紙上塗起來。</p>
<h3>水鄉的夢</h3>
<p>— 克明</p>
<p>這一個夏天，我們是得留在五里鎭上的一所破殘了的莊園裏來度過這些炎熱的氣候了。五里鎭是南方的一個近水的小地方，雖說是「鎭」，其實是祗在一條唯一的半泥半石子的小街上有着一爿破落的小茶館，一爿帶做「京廣洋貨生意的紙烟店，一爿糧食店，與一爿雜貨舖子而已；在一兩百畝地光景的面積的一個小村子裏，安放着僅有的一條狹街，四家小店，便叫它是「鎭」，似乎有點講不通罷？然而，這是沒有關係的：反正是一樣：我們今年得在那裏過夏了。</p>
<p>夏天的來臨是像戰爭中的襲擊一樣的，一刹眼，春日像夢般地飄去，接着連讓你思索的機會都沒有，一個炎炎的季候就横在你的前面了。初夏的當兒，我們從買賣中獲得了一些小小的利益，於是，當火一般的炎天來臨的當兒，我們决意要在可能的情况中找一個短短歇息，我一個能够生活得更簡單，更節省的地方來住一些日子，這樣地，我們就找到這小小的，樸實的（幾乎是原始的）五里鎭來了。</p>
<p>是一個三面環繞着水流的小邨子，是一個美妙的，據說是像夢一般的水鄉啊！在那兒，對於那二百多戶的本地居民，士地並不是主要的生命綫：在那兒，在不多的田畝上，人僅種植黔豆米雜糧等的輕性產物，而被當作唯一的生活的依據的，倒是那些整日夜在曠大的世界中波動着的水流，與那些飄在水面上的多數是從船戶那兒租來的，少數是自己家裏從祖上傳下來的船隻啊。在那兒，一份人家住那麽一二間茅屋，男人是四季都搖着船過活的，裝貨搭客，近村也去，遠村也去，女的春秋二季趕着在河裏打撈點魚蝦水族，拿着上近處的市鎭上去換點零錢；到冬夏則幫着在船上料理點雜事；小孩子，全是被生活賦與了特殊的愛船，愛水，愛胃險與漂流的天性的，自小就戲歡撈摸水上的浮萍，到七八歲上下便能單身在河中心打摸了，那麽一代一代的下去，人是漸漸地學着把水當自己的故鄉，而把船來當作自己的家了。從長成了的時候起，從上一代的手裏接過了沈重的櫓漿，在朋朗的日子裏，也在多風雨的日子裏，任着客人的意思而一處地飄流過去，當五十多歲的年齡開始在蒼黑的臉上標起了記號時候，他是曾看到了多少的水流與山啊，如今是，人老了下來，疲乏而衰敗了，於是，正像自己在少年時候從先一代的手裏度受了這沈重的使命一樣，也把這破舊的船隻與櫓漿，祝福着授與後一代的孩子們了。</p>
<p>然而，生長在水鄉的人是賦與着天然的空曠的心情的啊。縱然是老了，依然對這白茫茫的水鄕懷着無限的戀意的。早上，也許會上水邊去看看，對異鄕人好意而誇耀地述說着一些水鄉的風物興情調，老水手的褐灰色的臉，與從他嘴裏流出來的消息是足够使年輕的異鄉人神往的，人生活在賬簿與算盤珠中可不是幸福的啊！而想一想那碧藍色的天空，與萬里空曠的銀花樣的水吧！它們，是敎給了人以生活的本領，是鼓勵着人們，叫他們勇敢地向外面的世界裏去流浪的，直到衰老了爲止！</p>
<p>我們是在這個小邨子裏度過夏天的，而在這裏，我們大家都有了水鄉的夢。</p>

<h3>曁南影片公司新發展及其新人</h3>
<p>暨南影片公司在去年被封後，及今半戰，對於這次損失，非常重大，當事人尙在力圖解决中，一方面改組內部，廣聘新人材，一待整個解决後，即行正式擦新。</p>
<p>據該公司負資人談，公司行將啟封，至於工作，開始先將嚴夢所導演之「大地之春」拍竣，繼續開拍馮一　所編，馮挺導演之「風雨狂宵」，劇本寓意深刻，不日送京檢査，馮挺爲電影之新人，年少多村，且工詞曲，以前曾在大長城影片公司埋頭苦幹之編作者，祇以時機不就，輾轉多年，這次爲其處女作，故對於此次劇本，異常審愼。</p>
<p>歌曲則特請碧虹音浪社主辦人怒濤祖任，怒濤爲新派歌曲作者，現時各處播音台活動着的小姐們皆其社中之主力，此次怒　君準備以全體加入「風雨狂宵」，片內配演以王萌爲主角，王萌原籍厦門，長於南洋，年十八，慧　可人，且歌喉天賦，並具銀藝之天材，馮挺乃毅然以士　角居之，濟濟人材，響南或將有轉捩之生機乎？</p>

<h3>本埠建築及建築原料的過程（四）</h3>
<p>— 顧影</p>
<p>今年四個月中木材進口較上年同期增四百萬自實行新稅後水泥進口較三年前僅餘五之一</p>
<p>三，水泥：</p>
<p>水泥爲現代建築中之重要原料。　年惟賴外貨供給。自啟新洋灰公司開辦以來（按該公司頂自英商。此光緒三十三年事）。國內水泥銷數漸增。乃後起開設者有中國水泥股份有限公司。及上海華商水泥股份有限公司等相繼組織。產量以啟新爲矯子。其製造廠設於河北唐山。商標爲馬牌。因其品質優良。爲國人所樂用。故前年最多每年曾產過二百二十萬桶。次爲中國水泥股份有限公司。製造廠設江蘇句容龍潭山附近。泰山牌爲商標。產量曾每年出過八十萬桶。再次之爲上海水泥股份有限公司。製造廠設上海龍華。商標爲象牌。最多曾每年出過五十萬桶。其他如濟南之華記湖北公司。濟南致敬水泥公司。河南士敏士廠。廣州西村士敏士廠等所出之獅球牌飛行機牌。及五羊牌等每年曾最多出產共約一百二十萬桶。在民十五年至十九年間銷路爲最盛時期。蓋當時因建築事業之突飛猛進也。故國外水泥之輸入亦豐。自民二十一年起。國貨因增加統稅。自每桶六角增至一元二角。復受外貨之廉值傾軋故國貨大受打擊。產量因不能銷售而銳减。以二十二年計之啟新僅產一，五五七，二五二桶。中國七〇三，九三二桶。上海四二三，二八二桶。其他八九二，六四〇桶。以最多時之產量比之要减少百分之四十四。而外貨進口却反見增加。政府鑒及國產水泥之危機。乃實行海關增稅。新稅率爲每百公斤徵〇，八三金元。合國幣一元四角五分。以救濟國產水泥。而杜漏巵。自實行以來進口銳减去年進口總值爲一百〇三萬六千九百五十八關金元。此二十二年之三百七十一萬六千七百五十二關金元猛减二倍半餘。若以二十一年之五百六十五萬六千一百六十五關金元計之則僅餘五分之一。此實一良好之現象。而國產水泥將來或可蒸蒸日上也茲列十年水泥進口比較表與本年第一季中進口水泥國別表於下。以參參政、</p>

<h3>從建築藝術說到希臘的神廟（二）</h3>
<p>— 孫宗文</p>
<p>——世界建築史蹟上最光榮的一頁——</p>
<p>「地球好似女人，Parthenon爲她帶的最美的一粿珍珠：」</p>
<p>又讚美此神廟中所供之Athena女神的雕刻藝術論：</p>
<p>「沒有一個希臘人是快樂的，除了他看見過Athena雕刻的話！」</p>
<p>由此，可知希臘的美術，是何等的著稱於全世界！所以有句成語說：</p>
<p>「不管我所看見的東西，凡是美的，皆出自希臘！」</p>
<p>建築藝術旣同世界的美術史有一致密切的關係；而希臘的美術，尤爲世界所崇拜者；並且其神廟的出現，尤因受宗敎思想的結果；因此，我們可以斷言；希臘的神廟，爲建築藝術的唯一結晶品。故我們不談建築藝術則己，如要談到建築藝術，則不得不談到希臘的神廟建築；因爲牠是世界建築史蹟上最光榮的一頁啊！故我們不得不大書特書的！</p>
<p>（一）希臘民族性與建築藝術之影響</p>
<p>自十八世紀中葉，西歐古典主義之運動起；近人始知希臘美術方面之可貴；而對於建築方面，尤多供獻。故世界研究建築史的，皆以此希臘的建築藝術爲始，而其中尤以宗敎建築爲最；亦卽爲本文所要講到的「神廟之建築」；由此，可以推想到其他一切的建築藝術了。</p>
<p>我們深信，建築物是時代精神表現的結晶；換句話說，我們從某種建築物中，可以認識一代的民族性。希臘的神廟，就是一個强有力的鐵證。要談到牠的問題，我們應得把希臘的人文地理研究一下；因爲這些，對於建築的進化上，是極有關係的，亦極爲重要的。</p>
<p>希臘的文化，可說爲世界文學美術的起源地；因爲希臘的文化，同牠的地理最有關係；因其地天氣和暖，山水秀麗，所以人民聰慧，富於思想，因海岸綫之曲折，良港頗多，所以航海殖民和工商業均極發達；又因與文明最古之埃及及小亞細亞隔岸相望，故在靑銅時代已有文化了；同時，又因國內各城邦互相的競爭，故國中優美的文化，漸漸地散佈到世界各地；因之，其建築藝術及作風方式，隨着亦散佈到世界各國；使全地球的人民，深深地認識了希臘建築的固有藝術</p>
<p>希臘人對於宗敎有熱烈之信仰，他們認爲自然界的一切，爲神所主宰。我們現在如果讀到希臘的神話，則全爲關於神一方面的故事，這可作一個有力的鐵證。因此，其國內唯一宗敎之建築物，——神廟之多，亦可想而知了。除此以外，希臘人又好運動，且時有競賽會之舉行；每隔四年，卽在奧林比亞Olimpia地方舉行一次；各地人民麕集，除比賽體力，文藝之外，對於各地之美術文化，尤多互相交換及競賽之機會。因之，各地建築的作風，亦因而產生出美及新的效果了。由此看來，希臘人的民族性是愛好藝術的，信仰宗敎的；因藝術及宗敎的關係，更因受了古代文明燦爛的埃及美術的感化，遂創成了以希臘人特具的神廟建築藝術來。這，就是希腦一神廟建築」的來由。但是眞可惜！此種神廟之遺蹟，到現代幾已消滅殆盡了。卽使有。也不過是些破碎的雕刻，現保存於英倫皇家古物館中，徒給後人憑吊而已！</p>
<h3>建築上幾種應用的「算例」</h3>
<p>— 震寰</p>
<p>—也是關於築塲裏用—</p>
<p>建築在近代物質文明的國家，顯著的如英美等，已成爲「地位絕佳」的一種競爭的事業，而在於事事落後的咱們老大中國，這幾年來，對於建築事業，也漸呈蓬勃的趨向。因此，吃建築塲飯的，其產量之多，簡直難以統計，可是這行業，並不似姻紙店裏的小夥計那樣子隨隨便便容易幹得了的工作，至少在築塲裏混上二三年，跟具有相當經騐的老前輩討些「關子」，學些「門檻」，就是本文所談及的關於築塲裏日常應用的幾種「算例」，也比不得錢莊裏專門打算盤子在一絲上一毫用功夫那樣子簡單。</p>
<p>茲將「算例」，分門別類的寫點出來，縱然在吃築塲飯的讀者看後，談不上「無師自通」，但記牢在腦裏，也可以參考參考。</p>
<p>洋松Oregen　Pine</p>
<p>（說明）洋松在築塲裏可以說是大夥兒的進項，不論大小工程，處處地方都有它的份兒，普通如門窗，踏脚板，畫鏡綫，等等以及建造鋼骨水泥房屋用的壳子板，總之，洋松在築塲裏是不可缺少的需要品，猶之，吃飯難免碗筷一般。</p>
<p>算洋松是以寸做單位的假定有三寸髙六寸闊（俗呼三六）十六尺長的洋松一根，其算例的方式是：</p>
<p>卽得洋松的積數</p>
<p>（按阿拉伯數目字旁邊的　是代表寸，　是代表尺，這是築塲裏普遍的記號）不過照這樣算，未免麻煩，而且有時候容易錯誤，築塲裏有一種化寸的簡便口訣，如果讀熟了，逢到洋松對於三寸六寸兩者的數目，可以依化寸口訣預先化妥當，然後乘十六尺的數目，那末可以省去除十二的數目了，（按十二是一尺的寸數，築塲裏用尺的制度，是以英呎計算的，以八分爲一寸，以十二寸爲一尺）現將化寸口　訣錄之如左，</p>
<p>一寸—·〇八三五　二寸—·一六六　三寸—·二五</p>
<p>四寸—·三三三　五寸—·四一六　六寸—·五</p>
<p>七寸—·五八三　八寸—·六六六　九寸—·七五</p>
<p>十寸—·八三三　十一寸—·九一六　十二寸—·一·〇〇</p>
<p>照上面的口訣，再拿三寸髙六寸闊十六尺長的一根洋松，其算法以三寸乘六寸，卽得十八寸，現在應該明瞭十八寸减去十二寸祗有六寸，而十二寸是一尺，六寸是半尺，那末，十八寸就是一尺半，將一尺半（六寸）乘十六尺，算例的的方式是是：</p>
<p>二十四尺就是一根洋松的積數，算洋松就可以用這方法，決不會出岔口的，</p>
<p>磚Black</p>
<p>（說明）築塲裏砌墻用的磗，最普遍的是洪家灘，下甸廟，蘆墟，震蘇，而尤以洪家灘的二十五靑放，建造普通的出租市房比較多，近年漸採用蘆墟的九寸一分，四寸半，一寸六分的新三號，和震蘇的九寸，四寸半，二寸一分三號放，其他如馬爾康的汽泥磚，義品大中的空心磚，在建造高樓大厦，因爲要减輕壓力的載重，就需要它們了，還有是泰山的面磚，這僅僅是用於裝飾門面的。</p>
<p>算磚，（按這不過是築塲裏關於收貨先生的點貨的計算，並不是磚本身的體積及每方的多寡），除了所謂「豎烟囪」的方法已消滅於現在，差不多都用數「級頭」的方法了，（級頭詳建築行話）不過這裏也該簡單的表明，級頭就是磗的層數，有五級七級九級等的名目，譬方層數是五皮，卽是五級，七皮卽是七級，九皮卽是九級……計算的方法就是從地皮上第一皮假定有磗十二塊，第二皮十一塊，第三皮十塊，第四皮九塊，第五皮八塊，那末我們可以逐皮加攏，等於五十塊，可是築塲裏堆着的磚頭，並不那麼寥少，差不多整千整萬的堆着，假使都去一塊一塊算，不是太複雜而感到費時嗎？現在就有個便當的法子，祗消在中間一皮（卽第三皮）的數目乘層數的一共多少皮卽得，於是我們明瞭第三皮是十塊，層數是五級，就以十乘五等於五十塊，如果七級就算第四皮，九級第五皮，依此類推，終之，以中間一皮作標準。</p>
<p>黄沙石子Yellow　Sand　&amp;　Stone</p>
<p>（說明）黄沙石子是建造水門汀房屋所免不掉的材料，黄沙有寗波湖州的出產，石子有金山天平山的出產，可是石子的附品根多，有瓜子片蒼蠅片等等，</p>
<p>算黄沙石子，在上海是以噸，做單位的，每立方合噸數爲二噸一角六分，（按，每立方爲一百立方尺）普通用築塲裏扛　計，黄沙或石子，每二十六滿籮爲一立方，但內地仍採用「量方」算，例如黄沙或石子長十尺闊六尺髙二尺，三個數目長乘闊再乘高卽得積數爲一百二十尺，卽，立方二角，這算例在小時候讀書上算學課，像有一句口訣叫「長闊相乘得面積，再乘髙得體積」。築塲裏求立方或平方，都根據此一句成立的。</p>
<p>鋼骨Steel　Bar</p>
<p>（說明）鋼骨是建造水門汀房屋的主要材料，在搆造的立塲上，鋼骨是佔有最重要的地位，它有方圓竹節之分，和光圓的幾種名稱，普通用方竹節和光圓居多，除了光圓祗可以鎊秤計算外，方竹節或圓竹節鋼，另有一種固定的重量的。</p>
<p>算鋼骨（按，方竹節及圓竹節）求每支的重量等於多少鎊或噸，在築塲裏有一種表格，（按，鋼骨每支以四十尺長爲標準），今發表於左。</p>
<p>—方竹節每支的重量（以一尺計）</p>
<p>一寸—三·四三合一〇二斤十四兩。七分—二·六四合七九三兩。六分—一·九四合五八斤三兩。五分—一·三五合四十斤二兩。四分—·八六合二五斤十三兩。三分—·四九合十四斤十一兩。二分—·二二合六斤九兩。</p>
<p>—圓竹節每支的重量（以一尺計）</p>
<p>一寸—二·六七合八十斤二兩。七分—二·〇六合六一斤三兩。六分—一·五二合四五斤十兩。五分—一·〇五合三一斤二兩。四分—·六六合十九斤十三兩。三分—·三八合十一斤六兩。二分—·六七合五斤。</p>
<p>旣然有了這算鋼骨的每支重量（磅或噸）的表格，那末計算起來就容易了。對於鋼骨的算例是這樣的。</p>
<p>假定有三分方竹節鋼一百四十支。（每支爲四十尺）問共有幾噸。做法。以一百四十支的數目乘一九·六鎊，（按，此數是每支一尺，四九鎊乘四十尺長的積數），其方式是：　〇鎊再以求得之二七四·四磅的積數乘七五。（按此數是磅化斤的不變的數目），如果旣求出了斤的積數，那末再以一六八〇除之，（按一六八〇爲斤化噸的不變的數目），於是求出的就是一百四十支的噸數了。</p>
<p>還有一種鎊直接求噸的方法。是以二二四〇除之。（按二二四〇是鎊求噸的不變數目），中間可以省去七五的麻煩手續，不過築塲裏力求其詳。再好用前法爲佳。</p>
<p>以上是築塲裏普通所當用的算例，但築塲是複雜的。當然關於算例一項，並不這樣簡單的。雖然現在已經寫了上面四種。其他像算「鋸線」法。算門窗樘子法，算板條法，……等等以俟將來，一椿一樁的寫出來。</p>

<h3>Han River Waters Slightly Recede, All Embankments Remain Extremely Dangerous; Chiang Orders Heightening of All Embankments by Deadline; Cracks Found in Wutai and Wuqing Sluices; Han River's Lower Five Li Main Embankment Collapses; Zhang Qun Asks Chiang to Allocate More Flood Prevention Funds</h3>
<p>Engineers Blow Up Chenjiaji Pinghan Railway to Divert Xiang River into the Yangtze</p>
<p>(Hankou) The river water receded two inches on the 15th, marking the first sign of receding water this year. People's hearts are slightly more at ease, but all embankments remain extremely dangerous. The collapsed section of Zhang Gong Embankment at Gusaoshu is being reinforced. Cracks between Chenjiaji and Shaijiashan are also being urgently repaired. The Wuhui Embankment and Yongbao Sluice in Wuchang have collapsed for more than ten feet. Two companies of troops dispatched by the military camp have been trying to rescue the situation without success. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Wuchang Zhang Gong Embankment has been collapsing for over twenty feet in recent days. The situation is critical. On the morning of the 15th, Gao Yihan, Supervisor of the Two Lakes, inspected the situation in the scorching sun, carefully examining the area around the Gusaoshu and Qiaokou restricted area. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Chiang telegraphed to the provinces of Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu on the 15th, ordering that the embankment walls along the river be heightened by one meter and completed within one month to defend against floods. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Yang Silian, Director of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, resigned on the grounds of accumulated fatigue and illness. His whereabouts are unknown. Various newspapers have criticized Yang's actions. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Over twenty feet of the Wuqing Sluice embankment in Wuchang has collapsed. The Wu Jin Embankment, Wutai Sluice, and Wannian Sluice are all in danger. The flooded area of Wuyang has expanded, with up to 103,000 affected people. The Provincial Public Security Bureau is compiling a list for relief. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Zhang Qun urgently telegraphed Chiang on the 15th, saying that the counties upstream of the Yangtze and Xiang Rivers are almost completely flooded. The embankments in Wuhan are extremely precarious, and all efforts are being concentrated on emergency protection. The Jianghan Engineering Bureau received 300,000 in flood prevention funds from the Economic Commission, which they claim to have spent 370,000. At this critical moment of survival, the government has no choice but to be flexible. It has instructed the Finance Department and the Municipal Government to do their best to allocate funds, but their strength is limited. If relief cannot be provided due to a shortage of funds, and Wuhan and other unflooded areas are allowed to sink, how can we explain ourselves to the country and the people? He requested that Chiang preside over the allocation of an additional 200,000 in flood prevention funds to alleviate the immediate crisis and avoid delays. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Wu Guozhen stated that Zhang Gong Embankment is crucial to the safety of the entire city. The city government was responsible for repairing the section below Danshuichi during the flood twenty years ago, while the Jianghan Engineering Bureau was responsible for the section above Danshuichi. Today, the lower section is safe, but the upper section is dangerous everywhere. Director Yang is nowhere to be found. The government will deal with him in the future. Supervisor Gao Yihan has been inspecting the embankment work and the diligence of the personnel for several days. After thoroughly investigating those who have neglected their duties in repair and prevention, he will propose impeachment. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) On the 15th, a section of the Wutai Sluice's Wuwei Road embankment collapsed by about ten feet. The Wu Jin Embankment collapsed by three feet. Rescue efforts are underway. Flood victims from Wuchang are moving to Meijiashan, while flood victims from Hanyang are moving to Boyatai, Chaoyangting, Meizishan, and Liujiaoting to live in sheds. The Provincial Public Security Bureau will form a rescue team. On the 15th, the lower five-li main embankment of Hanchuan collapsed, flooding many fields. Passing ships were nearly sucked into the embankment. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) According to Ye Peng's report to Zhang Xueliang, fearing that Zhang Gong Embankment is too weak to withstand the pressure of the Xiang River, Zhang Xueliang dispatched an engineering regiment on the 15th to blow up the Pinghan Railway at Chenjiaji to allow the Xiang River to flow into the Yangtze. (15th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The weather in Hankou on the 15th was clear and bitterly hot, with the temperature continuing to rise to 90 degrees Celsius. The river water has stabilized. According to the Jianghan Customs water gauge report, the water level in Hankou at 4:00 PM on the 15th was 51 feet and 3 inches, a decrease of five inches compared to the 14th. Yichang was at 23 feet and 8 inches, Changsha at 25 feet and 2 inches, and Yuezhou at 50 feet and 1 inch, all lower than on the 14th. (15th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Since the sudden rise in water levels in Hankou, low-lying areas have been gradually flooded. According to investigations, a total of 351 streets and alleys have been flooded, affecting 19,275 households and 96,001 people. (15th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Wutai and Wuqing Sluices are crucial to the seven counties of Yang, Da, Pu, Wu, Xian, Chong, and Tong. Cracks and leaks were discovered in both sluices on the 15th. Zhang Qun, Liu Shoupeng, and others are extremely concerned. They personally inspected the sites on the 15th and allocated 1,500 workers and more than 20 vehicles to make every effort to rescue them to prevent accidents. (15th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) (Sent at 10:00 AM) At 9:50 AM this morning, the water level in Hankou remained unchanged at 51 feet and 3 inches. It is reported that the water level in Yichang decreased yesterday, while the water level in Chongqing was slightly higher. (15th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) This morning, a Reuters reporter inspected Zhang Gong Embankment. A section of the embankment collapsed four feet yesterday. Hundreds of coolies are working day and night under the supervision of the army to rescue the weak points of the embankment. Thousands of refugees are temporarily living in tents along the bank. The scene is very miserable. The river water has now receded by half a shichen (one hour). The authorities are working tirelessly to prevent disasters, which is praised by everyone. (15th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The authorities' struggle to protect Hankou has been relentless. The army is now requisitioning laborers to engage in disaster prevention work. Apart from this, everything here is as peaceful as usual. However, the corpses floating down the river are unbearable to witness. Foreign observers believe that even if Zhang Gong Embankment collapses, Hankou can still be preserved if the roadbed is raised to 53 feet. It is estimated that the central government has already taken note of this. The water level here remained unchanged at 6:20 PM this evening, but the water level in Chongqing and Wanxian rose slightly, as did the water level in Jiujiang. The water levels in Yichang, Shashi, and Yuezhou have fallen. (15th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Economic Commission received a telegram from Yang Silian, Director of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, on the 15th, requesting to come to Nanjing to report on the bureau's affairs in person and to send someone to temporarily take his place. The commission replied that it would not allow him to leave his post without permission, as the embankment defense is currently critical. If there are important official matters, he can send someone to Nanjing to report. It is also heard that the commission telegraphed the Chairman of Hubei, requesting that he telegraph the actual situation of the embankment defense in recent days for processing. (15th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The water gauge at 8:00 PM on the 15th was 51.2 feet, about one inch lower than the 51.3 feet at 8:00 AM. However, the water level is still rising in various places upstream, so it cannot be considered that the crisis has been averted. (15th Japan United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Since the continuous floods began in late June, the volume of various imports and exports has gradually decreased significantly. Japanese merchants are anxious about their stockpiles. Recently, due to the further impact of the floods, nearby transportation has also been cut off. As a result, the city is gradually facing a shortage of food, with prices rising by 10-20% every day. Panic has already occurred. The Japanese Civil Defense Corps is considering all possible contingencies and has requested assistance with rice and vegetables from Changsha and Shanghai as a preparatory measure. (15th Japan United Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Jiangsu and Shandong Contact Each Other Regarding Flood Control; Yellow River Water in Western Shandong Flows Southward Through the Niu Tou River in Jinxiang and Yutai to Jiangsu Province; Jiangsu Province Plans to Formulate Regional Flood Control Measures and Begin Construction of the Southern Embankment of Weishan Lake</h3>
<p>(Jinan) Today, the water level at Luokou is 28.78 meters, which is 2.03 meters lower than the highest level on the 13th. According to the River Bureau, the first breach is 100 meters wide, the second 220 meters, the third and fourth 80 meters each, the fifth 250 meters, and the sixth 60 meters. Currently, only the fifth and sixth breaches are flowing. The Yellow River Commission has telegraphed for closure of the breaches and allocated 10,000 yuan in subsidies. The Jiangxu Nianqian at the breach has been flooded, mistaken as being washed away, but in reality, it is still intact. There are ten Nian from top to bottom in this area, only the first Nian is slightly damaged, in Hebei territory, Chen Guofu telegraphed Han, the terrain in northern Jiangsu is low-lying, if the Yellow River breaches and the water flows from Jiyang and Weishan lakes, the danger is unpredictable. In addition to ordering strict precautions, he also telegraphed the Economic Commission to send personnel to Shandong to assist, hoping to settle the turbulent waves as soon as possible, and quickly relieve the difficulties of Shandong, and also ask to exempt the people of Jiangsu from the disaster. He replied that if the entire river flows downstream, there is a possibility of seizing the canal and entering Huai, hoping that all parties will appeal for the closure of the breaches. In addition, this time, the breach near Linpu was the first to bear the brunt. In addition to the loss of property, two people died in Wangtan Village, twenty each in Cuizhuang and Yang, more than two hundred in Linpu, and more than ten in Qingshuitan, for a total of about three hundred people. Also, the Yellow River water broke through the southern embankment of Zhushui River and went straight to Juye County. Han Duofeng, consultant of the provincial government, returned to Jinan after inspecting the breach and said that the cause of the breach was that the flood was too large upstream, and the area was also a major bend in the Yellow River, which was directly impacted by the fire. At night, it was suddenly reported that the east was breached, and suddenly the west collapsed. The people ran east and west, exhausted. Fortunately, the third People’s Nian inside the dam did not collapse, preserving 10,000 acres of land and accommodating the disaster victims, otherwise they would all be buried in the flood. He drove a boat to investigate, and the flooded villages only revealed the rooftops and branches of trees. The disaster victims lived on them. There is also a Dong Village nearby, suspended alone in the water, not flooded, shaped like an island. The breach water has flowed south for a large section, already entering the Zhushui River and the small section of Nanyang Hubei. It has passed Shouzhang Shilipu and entered Jiaxiang, flowing northeast through Daijiamiao into the accumulated water depression, with a tendency to return to the Yellow River through the Xin Canal and Qingshui River.

<h3>The Flood Disaster Has Reached a Critical Juncture</h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>The horror of the flood's assault. We have already repeatedly offered our dire warnings. Now, as the major flood season arrives, the dangerous situation increases daily without end. Li and Fan have been reduced to a watery expanse, and Yisha looks like a lone island. According to reports, the number of affected counties and cities in Jiangxi and Hubei provinces has reached over sixty. Wuhan, located at the lower reaches of the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, bears the brunt of the outpouring. Flood panic has deeply penetrated people's hearts. Although desperate rescue efforts have been made for days, it has been difficult to alleviate the perilous situation. Where the waters will eventually flow is difficult to imagine. In the north, the Yellow River has breached at Juancheng, causing harm to Dongping, Juye, Yucheng, and Heze counties. If it is allowed to seize the river and change its course, it will gradually encroach upon northern Jiangsu. Other rivers, such as the Yi, Luo, Luan, and Huai, are also at risk of overflowing. The provinces of Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan, and Anhui are all suffering from the disaster of submersion. Looking across the country, floods are everywhere. Our people, with their weary remaining lives, are enduring this calamity once again. The melons of Huangtai are picked again and again. The collapse of a scrawny ox is known to be unavoidable.</p>
<p>The prevalence of natural disasters is something that all countries experience. The key is to have proper prevention and control measures in place to avoid expanding the disaster. Our country's officials suffer from the problem of following old habits and being unwilling to act quickly. They engage in empty talk about knowing everything and working diligently, but they repeatedly create an uncontrollable situation due to delays and complications. Even in terms of this current flood control effort, the lack of preparation beforehand and the panic that only arises when the disaster occurs are undeniable facts. Furthermore, the people of the country are trapped in shortsighted errors, failing to think about working together as a team, which has also increased the severity of the situation. The Yangtze River was originally a good and well-behaved river. It is only because the drainage in the middle reaches is not smooth that there are many problems of congestion and breaches. The saying, "The benefit of the Yangtze is in Shu, and the harm is in Chu," should be a common saying known by the people of Hubei. Therefore, they should have planned for good preventive measures long ago. Moreover, the great flood disaster of twenty years ago caused the city of Hankou to be flooded for more than four months. The lesson is not far away. How can they forget the overturned cart in front of them and witness today's dangerous situation once again?</p>
<p>Now that things have come to this, there is no time to criticize past mistakes. It is also not the time to shirk responsibility. The only thing to do is for the entire country to unite and pool their efforts to try to escape the current severe oppression. In areas where rescue projects are underway, the authorities should not hesitate to take all necessary steps. Not only should laborers be forcibly conscripted, but financial resources should also be concentrated. The non-essential administrative expenses and stationed troops can all be transferred for use to relieve the immediate crisis. Moreover, officials and the people should cooperate with all their strength, without any suspicion. They must know that this is a matter of life and death, and there is no comparison between Qin and Yue in terms of prosperity and poverty. Responding according to their capabilities is extremely urgent. As for areas that have not yet been affected by the floods, both the government and the people should take precautions before it rains to avoid being caught off guard when the time comes. The Jiangsu Construction Department's rush to build the Jiangsu Dike is undoubtedly a timely and vigorous effort. It is hoped that they will persist with perseverance, relying on practical work, hard work, and urgent work. Other provinces with related interests should also negotiate with each other at any time and echo each other. In addition, regarding post-disaster relief in the disaster areas, such as burying the floating bones, removing the waste, and providing relief and resettlement for the disaster victims, the local authorities should handle them properly and quickly. On the one hand, this will prevent the displacement of the disaster victims, and on the other hand, it will prevent the potential breeding of epidemics. Turbulent currents reach the sky, and floating corpses fill the river. Disaster victims sleep in the open air, stretching for hundreds of miles. What a tragic scene this is! How can they not urgently address it?</p>
<p>In short, rescue and disaster relief are indeed the most urgent tasks at hand. After the flood season passes, how to ensure the peace and tranquility of the future and seek fundamental repairs must be a plan that the authorities and local people must determine to carry out when the initial wounds are being recovered. If the matter passes and the situation changes, and they are then ignored, then next year's flood will not be difficult to run rampant again. Qin Fen and Fu Rulin mentioned post-flood measures in their reports on the survey of water conditions. Although they are measures to treat the symptoms, they are also ways to prevent disasters. It is late to mend the fold, but it is not too late as long as the sheep has not been lost. It is deeply hoped that they will see their promises fulfilled and implemented and will not become empty words.</p>

<h3>Roosevelt's Tax Increase Plan Faces Considerable Opposition</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt's proposal to increase tax rates for the wealthy is encountering opposition from the same elements that opposed his public utilities bill. At the end of the week, the House Ways and Means Committee studied the President's tax increase plan, and as many as thirty people appeared to express opposition, with only two in favor. Even within the President's own party, opinions differ, and some government leaders have been lukewarm to the President's proposal. Therefore, the President's struggle is quite constrained. For example, Senator Harrison stated that tax rates have their limits, and if they exceed those limits, tax revenue will decrease. It is said that some Democratic congressmen are aware that the business community will strongly oppose it, and they are preparing to jointly go to the White House to request the President to abandon his plan and replace it with a progressive excess profits tax. The House Ways and Means Committee will study other issues this week, so drafting the tax increase bill will not be possible until July 22. (Fourteenth Dispatch from Kokumin)</p>
<h3>Lloyd George Presents New Deal Proposals to the British Cabinet, Which Have Been Released by the British Government</h3>
<p>(London) Lloyd George's New Deal proposals submitted to the Cabinet, containing extensive suggestions for national recovery, were released today. The main suggestions are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Issue "Prosperity Bonds" of £250 million over the next two years to fund profitable public works.</p>
<p>(2) Organize a National Development Authority to investigate domestic industrial, agricultural, and financial resources and plan their economic progress.</p>
<p>(3) Provide financial assistance to overseas markets to promote their development.</p>
<p>(4) The Cabinet should include the Prime Minister and four or five ministers without portfolio.</p>
<p>(5) The Bank of England should be placed under the management of a board representing the interests of national finance, industry, and commerce.</p>
<p>George advocated abolishing quotas after the expiration of the Ottawa Agreement, but strongly advocated implementing protective tariffs on British agriculture and implementing a strong plan to prevent the dumping of goods from other countries or British Dominions in Britain. George also emphatically stated that there is immense potential for development in countries within the British Empire that are underdeveloped, such as India and the colonies. Furthermore, both China and Russia have unlimited room for the expansion of international trade. George also emphasized the vastness of China's undeveloped resources and the importance of Britain's diplomatic and financial policies in the Far East. He continued by saying that because of the simplicity of equipment and the lack of transportation convenience, the wealth produced by each worker in China is less than one-thirtieth of that of workers in Canada and the United States. Besides commercial interests, there are many points to consider. If Western powers do not cooperate to help China recover and allow it to float and sink on its own, being invaded by Japan, the disaster will be immense. For the sake of future world harmony, Britain, the United States, and Russia should agree on a policy as powerful as Japan's and jointly assist China's recovery with Japan. George also advocated: (1) Britain should lend a huge sum to China. (2) Greater attention and more time should be given to the difficult diplomatic problems in the Far East. (3) The British Embassy in Beijing should be moved to Nanjing to deal with everything nearby. (Fifteenth Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<h3>Japan-Canada Trade War: Japan Prepares to Implement Retaliatory Taxes; Reply to Canada to be Sent Out Soon</h3>

Furthermore, based on the Trade Protection Law, the tariff will be raised, and negotiations will continue, separately implementing the policy from an independent standpoint. Furthermore, the gist of Japan's reply is as follows: (1) Japan's request does not demand a balance in Japan-Canada trade relations, but only requests the withdrawal of inappropriate measures against Japanese goods. (1) Requesting a reduction in official prices. (1) Anti-dumping taxes should be limited to major commodities. (1) Exchange dumping taxes violate the most-favored-nation treaty.

Although unrest is occurring in France now, it will not allow the collapse of its ideals. We still hope that France and Germany will eventually have a day of mutual understanding. Over the past few weeks, relations between France and Germany have indeed improved. (Fifteenth Dispatch from Kokumin)</p>

Italy's four demands are as follows: (1) To re-demarcate the border between Italian Somaliland and Abyssinia, and for Abyssinia to grant Italy economic concessions. (2) To build a railway through Abyssinia connecting Eritrea and Italian Somaliland, both of which are Italian territories, with Abyssinia in the middle. (3) For the Abyssinian government to hire Italian advisors. (4) To establish administrative departments similar to the British system in Egypt. It is reported that private talks are being held in London, Paris, and Rome, but the situation can be considered completely hopeless. Although the first two items do not seem to be very difficult, Abyssinia firmly opposes the establishment of any protected areas in the railway area and has consistently disapproved of hiring Italian advisors.

<h3>If Mediation Fails, the League of Nations Will Hold a Meeting to Discuss; Avenol Says Before Leaving England for France That the British Public and Parliament Support the Collective Security System</h3>
<p>(London) If Italy and Abyssinia cannot resolve their dispute through arbitration before July 25, the League of Nations Council will decide to meet on July 25 to discuss the case. League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol made this announcement before departing for Paris this afternoon, and said that the British public and the House of Commons now strongly support the collective security system.

<p>(London) The Daily Telegraph's diplomatic correspondent recently discussed the attitude that Italy may take towards the League of Nations in the Abyssinian question, saying that according to reliable sources, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has no intention of withdrawing from the League of Nations, but if Italy is rejected by the League of Nations, in other words, if the League of Nations declares that Italy has violated the covenant, then Italy will immediately announce its withdrawal from the League. When the League of Nations Council meets on the 25th of this month to discuss the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, Italy intends to formally present its accusations against Abyssinia to the League.

<h3>Mussolini Re-Mobilizes Two Divisions and Begins Building Ten Submarines</h3>
<p>(Rome) A bulletin was issued here today stating that Mussolini, in view of the increasing importance of military preparations for Abyssinia, has decided to adopt a new plan to cope with any eventuality. The Cirene Division has now been called into service, commanded by General Pettini, and a second Cirene Division will be formed to replace it, commanded by General Miglioli. A fifth Blackshirt Division will also be formed, named the "February 1st Division," commanded by General Truschi, totaling 55,000 men, half of whom will go abroad to serve. In addition, 15,000 special forces will be recruited to serve in engineering, motor, and aerial services, and other troops will be prepared for service. Ten submarines will soon be built and are scheduled to be launched simultaneously in early 1936. Some quarters view this action as a response to the impression that Mussolini is currently bluffing and that the Italo-Abyssinian dispute may eventually be resolved peacefully through the mediation of the League of Nations. (Fifteenth Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to sources here, Mussolini's strategy for fighting against Abyssinia differs considerably from that of the General Staff of the Army. The two strategies currently under debate are: (1) To advance from the north, south, and west in separate directions, with the Abyssinian capital as the destination. (2) To focus on stationing troops in the Abyssinian lowlands to blockade Abyssinia and force the Abyssinian king to surrender. (Fifteenth Dispatch from Kokumin)</p>
<p>Cairo: According to sources here, since the end of March this year, as many as 95 ships carrying Italian soldiers have passed through the Suez Canal. It is heard that there are still 27 ships that should pass through before the end of this month. The Italian soldiers being transported to East Africa mostly land at Massawa in Italian Eritrea. Massawa is the hottest port in the world, and its climate is not suitable for the stationing of Europeans. Therefore, after the Italian soldiers arrive here, they are sent to Asmara to garrison. However, there are still many Italian soldiers who do not acclimatize. Even in this month alone, as many as 3,000 soldiers have been sent back due to illness caused by failure to acclimatize.

<h3>British Veterans and American Blacks Enlist in Abyssinia; American Merchants Also Provide Various Assistance</h3>
<p>(London) Some British retired military officers have organized a mercenary army to go to Abyssinia to help fight. They have recently been secretly recruiting soldiers in London and other provinces, who will go to Abyssinia next month. It is stipulated that each recruit will be paid 16 shillings per day by the Abyssinian government. Regarding this matter, the authorities have stated that if Italy and Abyssinia have not declared war, British people cannot be legally prohibited from enlisting in foreign armies. However, if the two countries declare war, British people who join the ranks and fight against Britain's allies may be fined or imprisoned. (Fourteenth Dispatch from Havas)</p>
<p>(New York) The sound of war drums in Abyssinia has today awakened the reaction of blacks here. According to international law, recruiting soldiers within the territory of a third country is an illegal act, but hundreds of blacks here have offered their services to Abyssinia. Although the Abyssinian king has not yet permitted this move by American blacks, the hearts of blacks here to aid Abyssinia and resist Italy do not hesitate in the slightest. (Fourteenth Dispatch from Kokumin)</p>
<p>(London) According to the Daily Mail's correspondent in the Abyssinian capital, there is no shortage of American companies and individuals willing to provide economic assistance and military aid to Abyssinia. One company is willing to provide 50 skilled aircraft pilots and one doctor to Abyssinia, and another company is willing to provide a large number of officers and a large number of munitions.

<h3>British Territory in West Africa Rich in Gold Deposits; Group Companies Engage in Gold Mining; The Gold Coast Lives Up to Its Name</h3>
<p>(London) The British territory in West Africa, called the Gold Coast, stretches 334 miles along the Gulf of Guinea, between the French Ivory Coast and Togo. According to an article by Governor Sir Hazzard in today's Financial Times, it can produce a great deal of gold, comparable to the South African Union. It has the richest gold mines in the world, and recent surveys have proven this. If the gold content underground is equal to the ground surface, then gold and the coast will soon become known to the world as gold-producing countries, and be known for their prosperity. In 1933, five gold mines were under construction, and sixteen were surveyed but not yet under construction. At the end of 1934, seven were under construction and twenty-four were under construction. In addition, fifteen companies are still being organized. The number of workers engaged in gold mining last year, including Europeans and Africans, has doubled compared to before. However, the Gold Coast has various difficulties that the South African Union does not have. The sanitary conditions are extremely unfavorable, the forests are dense, and the continent is extremely small. Gold mining companies are working with the government to improve sanitary conditions, declaring war on mosquitoes that spread heat and yellow fever. The government is opening new roads to reach the mining areas and is revising the mining regulations. (Fifteenth Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<h3>Austria Situation Calm; Premier Recovers; Cause of Accident Announced</h3>
<p>(Vienna) Vice-Chancellor Starhemberg returned to the capital from Venice this afternoon. A cabinet meeting was held that night. The entire country remains absolutely calm. Premier Schuschnigg's car accident on Saturday and Sunday is unlikely to have political repercussions. However, because Starhemberg is currently acting as premier, his Internal Security Force will have its power slightly increased. Schuschnigg suffered complete memory loss due to the shock but is improving today, able to tell his son of his wife’s passing. Schuschnigg's chauffeur, initially reported dead from injuries, is now known to be alive and expected to recover. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) Austrian Vice-Chancellor Prince Starhemberg returned here by plane from Venice today. If Premier Schuschnigg is unable to preside over the cabinet due to injuries sustained in the car accident, he is prepared to establish a regency or dictatorship, backed by his Internal Security Force. However, the Premier, accompanied by President Miklas, returned here today from Linz in a heavily guarded special train. The cabinet has also prepared to hold a meeting immediately. After the Premier was injured, it was initially believed that he had lost his memory, causing tension throughout Austria, fearing the restoration of Archduke Otto and the potential mobilization of the Little Entente countries. If an investigation into the Premier's car accident reveals a conspiracy, the situation would be even more dangerous. Therefore, the Premier ordered strict censorship of all news upon his return to the capital, forbidding the publication of this information. It was learned today that the Premier's eight-year-old son was injured in the waist. Condolences from all over the world have been received regarding the unfortunate death of the Premier's wife. Pope Pius XI of Rome and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini have both sent telegrams to the Austrian Premier to express their condolences. (National Telegraph dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) Premier Schuschnigg suffered a nervous shock after the car accident and has now fully recovered. This morning, a mass was held in the Linz cathedral for the Premier's wife, which the Premier personally attended. He then returned to the capital in the afternoon. The remains of the Premier's wife have been transported to the Schönbrunn church, with troops and military organizations lined up along the way to pay their respects. The public stood densely along the roadside, silently mourning. The funeral is currently scheduled for 3:00 PM on Tuesday. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) An official statement was released stating that on the 13th of this month, Premier Schuschnigg and his family were involved in a car accident, resulting in the death of the Premier's wife at the scene and injuries to the Premier.

This was an accident caused by circumstances, and no one is responsible. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Belgrade. Today, the Politika newspaper published an article stating that Austria's repeal of the laws concerning the Habsburg royal family is expected to fundamentally change Yugoslavia's foreign policy. The newspaper believes that Austria's return of property to the Habsburg royal family can be seen as Austria's internal affairs, but such a decision will also affect Austria's independence. Whether foreign countries will adopt a tacit policy towards Austria's restoration movement is yet to be seen, but the foreign policy of Central European countries will undergo a major change, which can be predicted.

<h3>Only Four European Countries Have Not Resumed Diplomatic Relations with Soviet Russia; Improved US-Russia Trade Relations More Significant Than Resumption of Relations</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet Russian officials claimed today that as a result of the conclusion of the US-Russia commercial treaty, Soviet Russia is expected to purchase machinery and cotton worth US$30 million from the United States within the treaty's one-year validity period. It was also announced here today that Belgium's recognition of Soviet Russia officially took effect on July 14th. The recognition procedure was very simple, with only one exchange of letters between the two countries. After Belgium's recognition of Soviet Russia, the only European countries that have not yet established diplomatic relations with Soviet Russia are Switzerland, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Yugoslavia. (National News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Paris) French newspapers rushed to publish comments on the establishment of normal diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Belgium, pointing out that this is a direct result of the consolidation of the Soviet Union's economic power and the growth of its international political influence. The *Créateur* newspaper stated, "This move is sufficient to strengthen the League of Nations, consolidate peace, and especially increase the importance of the Soviet-French agreement, and this importance will further increase thereafter."

<h3>French Financial Deficit</h3>
<p>(London) The foreign exchange market was relieved today to hear that July 14th in Paris had passed peacefully. However, the fact that France's revenue in the second quarter of this year was lower than in the first quarter of this year and the second quarter of last year shows the seriousness of France's situation. France's total revenue in the first half of this year was 14,614,000,000 francs, a decrease of 1,345,000,000 francs compared to the same period last year. If revenue does not improve in the future, or expenses are not reduced, the budget deficit for 1935 will reach 4,000,000,000 francs. London rumors suggest that the French government has decided to cut salaries by 10% and levy a 10% tax on securities income. This measure is of a restrictive nature and may not be realized, as it may not be welcomed by all sectors of French society. However, in order to maintain a balanced budget, there is no alternative to severe measures. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>

<h3>Shandong Provincial Authorities Actively Preparing to Aid Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>(Jinan) Today, representatives from all walks of life, including He Siyuan, held a meeting at the provincial party headquarters to discuss and decide to establish the Shandong All-Circles Yellow River Flood Relief Association. There are 72 committee members, and 15 people, including He, were elected as standing committee members. They are requesting that the Central Government quickly raise funds to block the breach and provide emergency relief. They are also imitating the precedent of the 1931 Yangtze River flood, deducting salaries from national civil servants to use as relief funds, and not remitting income tax to the Central Government, using it as relief funds. The city will first raise 20,000 yuan to provide emergency relief to the disaster areas. Han [Fuju] has the greatest determination to provide disaster relief. The relief funds being prepared include new additional surcharges, which can yield 600,000 yuan, funds released by the reduction of district chiefs of 250,000 yuan, and salary deductions from provincial civil servants, which can yield 300,000 yuan. The Relief Association still has 100,000 yuan in funds. If it is not enough, more will be raised. It has now ordered the counties in the disaster area to handle local taxes and relief funds, and act as appropriate. When disaster victims arrive in Jinan, they will be accommodated as much as possible, with men working and women making cloth socks for the province's military and police, and children attending school.

Standing Committee member Ye Chucang presided. Xiao Jishan reported on the responsibilities we should shoulder in the future, stating that our country's national character is usually loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace, and in times of emergency, it is endurance of humiliation and striving for survival. The display of this national character has many precedents in history. We associate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's last words, "Peace, struggle, save China," as a footnote to enduring humiliation and striving for survival. Before 1928, the party was in the position of a wet nurse, and after 1928, it was in the position of the Duke of Zhou. Now, it is in the position of a loyal minister and a neglected son, bearing the responsibility of promoting recovery. Therefore, all comrades, regardless of the size or difficulty of the task, whether passive or active, must resolutely take on this important task to strive for survival and save China. The speech ended at 8:30 AM, and the meeting was adjourned. (Central News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>

<h3>Severe Disaster in Wuhan, Zhanggong Embankment in Danger Again, Ten Gongzhang Collapses, One Meter Subsidence, Yang Silian Flees to Escape Punishment, Over 100,000 Disaster Victims Urgently Need Relief Funds</h3>
<p>Correspondence from Hankou describes how the three cities of Wuhan are threatened by floods, and the dikes are in critical condition. Over a million citizens are living in fear. He Chenjun, the Pacification Director, and Zhang Qun, the Provincial Chairman, have authorized Ye Peng, the Garrison Commander, to take unified command in order to save the dikes. If necessary, forced labor and material requisitioning may be implemented. All party headquarters, agencies, groups, military units, police, and fire brigades are fully mobilized. In Hankou, the Zhanggong Embankment surrounds the city on three sides for dozens of miles, solely defending against the waters of the Xiang River and Houhu Lake, making it the only guarantee for the city. Unfortunately, Yang Silian, the director of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, responsible for repairing and defending the embankment, acted perfunctorily, neglecting precautions in advance and failing to initiate rescue efforts early in the flood season. As a result, the upper, middle, and lower sections were riddled with holes and surrounded by danger. When personnel from various agencies and groups mobilized on the 13th, there was a severe shortage of mud, wood chips, sandbags, and burlap bags. Over a thousand people trying to rescue the embankment could only stare at it empty-handed and sigh. On the 14th, the embankment body in the middle section near Gusao Tree collapsed, spanning over a hundred meters, with a subsidence of over ten meters. The situation was extremely tense. Zhang Xueliang, Zhang Qun, He Chenjun, Ye Peng, Wu Guozhen, and others stood under the scorching sun, supervising the rescue efforts and implementing forced labor, paying six jiao of ocean currency per person. Fortunately, the dike did not breach from noon to night. However, the dams at Danshui Pond and Zhanjiaji Jinmen and other places are still in danger. When the engineering was urgent, Yang Silian, the director of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, suddenly claimed illness, resigned, and disappeared without a trace. The citizens are all indignant. Ye Peng now independently takes responsibility for rescuing the embankment, and a Hankou flood prevention office has been established on the embankment, commanding operations with military orders. Although the river has risen to 51.5 feet, the situation has stabilized slightly. If it recedes sharply within days, there may be no danger. If it rises again unfortunately, it will inevitably overflow even if it does not breach. All efforts are being made to protect the embankment, but this is all that can be done. The rest is up to fate. In Wuchang, the Wutai Gate, Jiangshen Temple, Guanyinge, Wanghui Bridge, Wenchangmen, Chopstick Dike, Wannian Gate, Wuchang Gate, Lufangkou, and Wuhui Dike are all in imminent danger. The Wuqing Gate Dike collapsed for two zhang, but it was fortunately blocked immediately by the rescue efforts supervised by Cai Mengjian, the director of the Public Security Bureau. In Hanyang, the entire city is flooded, and there are no longer any embankments that can be breached. The number of disaster victims, including those in Wuchang, has increased to over a hundred thousand, all anxiously awaiting relief. The Disaster Relief General Association held its first plenary committee meeting on the 14th, deciding to first borrow funds from the banking syndicate to provide emergency relief. Provincial Chairman Zhang Qun also urgently telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to report the disaster and the critical situation of the Wuhan embankment. The telegram stated, "Extremely urgent, Chairman Chiang in Chengdu: Hubei Province, surrounded by rivers and lakes, is known as a water country. Every summer and autumn, it suffers from flooding and disasters. This government, mindful of the suffering of the past twenty years, has focused on repairing and defending dikes, not daring to be negligent. Orders have been issued repeatedly. Unexpectedly, in recent days, mountain torrents have erupted in various places, and the Jiang and Xiang rivers have risen simultaneously. As a result, the upstream areas are experiencing thunderous waves and collapsing mountains, while the downstream areas are flooded and submerged, turning thousands of miles into a fish farm. It is estimated that all areas along the Jiang River in western Hubei and along the Han River in northern Hubei have suffered severe disasters. In Yichang, Jiangling, Tianmen, Fancheng, Lahekou, Gucheng, and other places, the suddenness of the flood caused people to flee for their lives, resulting in countless drownings. Many garrison troops, police officers, and civil servants were also drowned in haste. City walls collapsed in Yunyang, Guanghua, and Gucheng counties. The parapets of Tianmen County are all submerged, and boats can navigate on the roof of the special commissioner's office. The entire county of Hanchuan is a vast expanse of water, almost completely submerged. The survivors are either perched on rooftops, climbing trees, sheltering on hills, or huddled on precarious dikes, exposed to the sun and starved of food. They are on the verge of death. The disaster is unprecedented in a century. This government is currently distributing all available relief funds separately, dispatching police boats to provide rescue, and ordering local officials to make appropriate arrangements for relief. It is also following the Xingying's telegram order to establish the Hubei Provincial Flood Relief General Association to coordinate relief funds and allocate 100,000 yuan from the provincial treasury to meet urgent needs. However, after years of disasters, the province's treasury is empty, and the people's resources are exhausted. Raising relief funds is extremely difficult. Repeated telegrams have been sent to the Executive Yuan, the Economic Commission, and the Relief Commission, requesting the allocation of large sums of money to provide generous assistance to the disaster victims and telegraphs have been presented to the Xingying requesting that they be forwarded and urged so the victims get assistance. The people are awaiting day and night. I implore the Prime Minister to urge the Central Government to provide irrigation assistance to save many people. The disaster victims will be fortunate, and Hubei will be fortunate. Over the past two days, the water level in Wuhan has continued to rise sharply. The dams at Jinmen, Danshui Pond in Hankou, and Wuhui Dike in Wuchang are all in extreme danger. Troops and civilians are still desperately trying to protect them. If they unfortunately breach, the future will be unimaginable. This is a combined report. Your subordinate, Zhang Qun, bows in respect." A telegram was also sent to the Executive Yuan, the Central Relief Commission, and the National Economic Commission, continuing to report the disaster, stating that the water level in Wuhan had risen sharply, and the water level near the Xiang River was at an unprecedented record high. All dikes are in imminent danger. The devastation in the upstream counties is more than double that of twenty years ago. It is earnestly requested that large sums of money be allocated immediately to save the survivors. (14th)</p>
<h3>Mountain Torrent Causes the Yi and Luo Rivers to Rise, Yanshi and Gongxian Submerged, Severe Disasters in Fengqiu, Hua County, and Lancao</h3>
<p>Correspondence from Kaifeng states that just as Henan Province has emerged from a severe drought, floods have followed. The worst affected areas are Yanshi and Gongxian in western Henan, as well as Fengqiu and Hua County in northern Henan, and Lancao in eastern Henan. Yanshi County is located on the north side of the Luo River and is extremely low-lying. When mountain torrents erupted in the upper reaches of the Luo River, the Yi River also rose simultaneously. On the morning of the 9th, both rivers converged at Xuyang Village, carrying water heads as high as 17 feet, surging ferociously towards the city walls and turning the area into a watery land. The sound of collapsing houses and the cries for help from the disaster victims echoed each other, painting a picture of human misery. Those living on the upper floors were submerged up to their waists. The number of drownings is countless. According to those who escaped the city on the 12th, hundreds of corpses have already been recovered. Other losses are even more difficult to calculate. The old city of Gongxian was also completely submerged. Houses and property in the 18 Su villages, Huiguoji, Luozhuang, Qingyizhen, Heishiguan, Xiaoyizhen, and Dongzhan along the Luo River in the county were all washed away. Due to mountain torrents erupting in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, the flow increased sharply. The Dianji Village, located six or seven li north of Guantaimen, which was closed this spring, also breached on the 9th. By noon, the water reached Baiwang, Taobei, Linzhuang, Liwan, Panqiu, and other villages. On the 11th, Liuguangzhen was submerged. The second and fourth districts of Fengqiu were flooded for dozens of li in one day and night, even more severe than the disaster last year. Hua County was also submerged like Fengqiu. The people in the villages between Kaocheng and Guying in Mian County were also submerged on the night of the 10th. Thus, the floods of 1933 have reappeared in Lancao and Kaocheng. (13th)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Handles Post-Flood Relief: Provincial Government Allocates 100,000 Yuan for Work Relief, River Management Committee Drafts Loan Repair Measures</h3>
<p>Correspondence from Guangzhou states that among the five counties affected by the West River floods in Guangdong Province, Sihui and Guangning are the most severely affected, followed by Gaoming and Gaoyao, and then Sanshui. In addition, the Nanhai, Zhongshan, Shunde, and Xinhui counties in the central district have also reported flooding. Although the floodwaters have receded, the rural economy in the disaster areas has collapsed, causing the victims to wander. The provincial government agencies and charities reported that the Civil Affairs Department would allocate 1,000 yuan each to Gaoming, Gaoyao, Sihui, and Guangning counties from the disaster relief funds to prepare for emergency relief. The Benevolence and Charity Hall also dispatched two emergency relief teams, the first team transporting 40,000 catties of rice to Sanshui, Sihui, and Gaoyao, and the second team transporting over 20,000 catties of rice and medicine to Guangning and Gaoming for distribution. According to reports from the distribution teams returning to the province, the disaster area in Sihui County is the largest, with a total of over 900 hectares of rice paddies submerged, with water levels ranging from eight to twelve feet on the plains. The majority of the refugees, numbering over 100,000, have taken refuge in the mountains. In Guangning County, 160 houses collapsed in Ping'an Township in the first district, and over 2,000 mu of rice paddies were lost. The losses in the remaining second, fourth, fifth, sixth, and ninth districts are even more significant, with a total loss of over one million yuan. Statistics show that over a hundred villages have been affected, over a thousand houses have collapsed, and over 14,000 disaster victims are homeless, accounting for sixty to seventy percent of the population. The water level in Gushui Town in the county was over three zhang high. According to local elders, there was a flood in the county during the Yi You year of the late Qing Dynasty, but the water level was two feet lower than this time, indicating that this flood is the worst in fifty years. After the flood, all industries in the county have declined, with an estimated 100,000 people unemployed. In recent days, representatives from various disaster areas have arrived in the provincial capital, appealing to various agencies for fundamental relief. They request the allocation of large sums of money to rebuild the levees and at the same time allocate funds to distribute to farmers to purchase seeds and rush to cultivate the autumn harvest to make up for the losses. They also request loans to repair the collapsed dikes to prevent the floodwaters from rising again. At the 403rd provincial affairs meeting held a few days ago, the provincial government immediately decided to allocate 100,000 yuan from the provincial treasury to handle post-flood relief in the northwest of the West River, providing work relief. The Guangdong River Management Committee, when West River floods, also sent deputy engineers to the disaster areas for investigation. The Association especially propose the following counties loan repair measures , (1) Those approved to borrow money for repairs by the Association will do so as per methods laid down, (2) For funds borrowed , methods of repayment will be first presented and approved, (3) Borrowed funds will be guaranteed by 2/3 or more Directors of their associations signing agreement as responsible parties for repayment, (4)Borrowed funds is undertaken by Directors, with requirement to find merchants Guangzhou to act as guarantor and bond providers, (5) Situations may arise in which this Association ,after due consideration may collect interests on monies lent.

<h3>Fujian Provincial Government Plans to Issue Two Types of Bonds: Construction Bonds Scheduled for Issuance, Liquidation of Old Debt Bonds Still Pending Approval</h3>
<p>Correspondence from Fuzhou states that the Fujian Provincial Government previously planned to issue 3 million yuan of Construction Bonds and 5 million yuan of Liquidation of Old Debt Bonds. After drafting the regulations and rules, they were submitted to the Central Government for approval. Currently, the Construction Bonds have been passed by the Legislative Yuan, but only public sales are allowed, and arbitrary apportionment is not permitted. The Liquidation of Old Debt Bonds are still under review because the old debts in the province are very complicated. Some debts do not need to be repaid, and some old bond prices are very low, so they cannot be repaid at face value. The Provincial Government has revised the original list of debts, including whether the principal and interest should be repaid and the discount methods, and submitted the revised form for review. However, the Legislative Yuan is currently in recess due to the summer heat, so it will not be discussed until autumn. The Construction Bonds, which have been approved for issuance, are scheduled to be issued on August 1st. The repayment tickets have been sent to a printing house for printing. Once completed, they will be mortgaged to the Shanghai branches of the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Shanghai Bank, and China-South Bank, as well as the Fujian branches of the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank, and Industrial Bank. Each bank will be mortgaged for approximately 500,000 to 200,000 yuan, receiving 98% of the face value and repaying the debt by the end of 1944. The provincial housing tax and tooth tax will be used as the fund for repaying the principal and interest. The Director of the Finance Department, Xu Fu, will go to Shanghai to contact the banking industry as soon as Provincial Chairman Chen Yi returns to the province.

<h3>Guangxi Huaiji Suffers Severe Flooding: Water Depth Reaches Forty to Fifty Feet, Thousands of Houses Collapse, Refugees Abound, Losses Amount to Hundreds of Thousands of Dollars</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Wuzhou states that last month, the Fu River and Da River in Guangxi Province experienced a sudden surge in water levels. The water level in Wuzhou rose by forty to fifty feet, and the southwest civil aviation airport was also flooded. Reports of wooden rafts and boats being washed away on the Wuzhou River surface were frequent. Fortunately, Wuzhou's flood prevention facilities were adequate, preventing a major disaster. However, Huaiji County in Guangxi Province, bordering Guangning County in Guangdong Province, suffered an unprecedented flood in the middle of last month. According to returning travelers, Huaiji County experienced torrential rain beginning on the 17th of last month, lasting for three consecutive days. The Lan Zhong River, Leng Keng River, and Zhongzhou River within the city all flooded simultaneously. By the evening of the 19th, the water level rose rapidly, with the water depth in the plains of the three river basins reaching forty to fifty feet. Villages along the river were completely submerged. In the vicinity of Zhongzhou River, the old and new towns, Zhuwan, and Shui Xia Village, all mud-brick houses collapsed, with less than twenty percent remaining. The disaster was particularly severe in Zhou Sha Bian. In the areas of Wenwu, Zengtian, Songbai River, Getang, Longgang, and Butang, residences were completely destroyed. From Lan Dong to the shops south of the city, more than a thousand houses collapsed. In Lengkeng, Shuikou, Shalu, Longdong, Sankeng, Fengmugen, and other places, crops were completely submerged. In Lengshui Fenggang in the eastern district, six to seven hundred houses collapsed, and the plains became marshes, while fields were transformed into gravelly land. Seven people drowned in Zhongcun's two towns, one in Xinpu Village, and two in Guandi Village. When the flood struck, transportation was cut off, and cries for help echoed through the valleys. Villagers, supporting the elderly and carrying children, sought refuge in the hills, while various places along the river turned into a vast expanse of water. Livestock and grains floated everywhere. Boats navigated the foothills to ferry refugees. The floodwaters began to recede on the 20th, but remained for several days. According to elders, a major flood occurred in the county's bamboo groves during the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, but it was not as devastating as this one. It is estimated that the total losses in the county amount to four to five million dollars. Public utilities such as telephone lines, roads, and bridges were all washed away. Currently, approximately thirty to forty thousand people are homeless, enduring extremely miserable conditions, exposed to the elements. After the floodwaters receded, all sectors of the county convened to discuss emergency relief efforts. The Huaiji Flood Relief Association was immediately established, and the county allocated five thousand dollars to purchase rice for distribution to the refugees, with each person receiving five liters of rice at a time, and the elderly without food receiving twenty cents. The Guangxi Provincial Government, upon receiving the report, deemed the disaster in the county to be severe and approved an allocation of ten thousand dollars in public funds for relief.

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Thieves Patronize a Peddler's Home</p>
<p>Yang Bensheng, a peddler from the Wuquekou Jiangnan Township in the Eighth District of Punan, had no savings and barely made a living. Unexpectedly, around 1:00 AM on the 13th, three or four thieves, speaking in local accents and wielding carrying poles as weapons, broke in through the front door. They first beat Yang's wife, Wang, injuring her arm, and then began searching the house, overturning chests and cabinets. Neighbors heard the commotion, and the thieves, startled, fled in panic. Upon inspection, it was found that only eleven thousand copper coins were missing, and other stolen goods were left behind. The Panyang Watch Post was notified and dispatched officers to investigate, and the case was reported to the Public Security Bureau for assistance in apprehending the criminals.</p>
<p>Sick Husband's Wife Suddenly Throws Herself into Well</p>
<p>Wu Chundang, a tenant residing in Dadai Nei, East City, is nearly sixty years old. His son, Yunlong, twenty-eight, married Sheng Shubing from Jingjiang, twenty-three.

She was also afflicted with a cold, but still cared for him as usual. Their affection for each other was well-known among the neighbors. However, on the night of the 13th, Shubing suddenly complained of thirst, got out of bed, and did not return for a long time. Yunlong, suspicious, searched the house with difficulty, and found her in the Houzhuyuan well. By the time she was pulled out, she was dead. A suicide note was found near her body, which Yunlong kept and refused to reveal. Yunlong grieved deeply over her body. Some said that she was overwhelmed by illness and chose to end her life.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Petition for Interpretation of New Publication Law</p>
<p>The Wuxi Journalists Association, concerned about the libel suit against the Ren Dao Xin Min three newspapers for reporting on the Caoqiao murder case, and the recent spate of lawsuits against newspapers, which have affected the morale of journalists, has organized a special committee to seek fundamental remedies. At the second committee meeting held the other day, committee members Shi Qinglin, Xu Chizi, Xi Xiangfeng, Yang Chusun, and others, eight in total, chaired by Sun Dexian, resolved the following: 1. To request an interpretation of the scope of the new publication law regarding the prohibition of publishing personal or family privacy matters. 2. To point out that the current system of imposing triple penalties for a single act of unintentional misreporting in newspapers undermines the security of the press. 3. To seek clarification on the distinction between intentional and negligent defamation. 4. To inquire whether the penalties stipulated in Article 39 of the new publication law apply jointly to the publisher, editor, author, and printer. These four points will be submitted to the Yuan and Bu for interpretation, and letters will be sent to colleagues in other areas to solicit joint signatures. The other matters were omitted. On the 15th, at 9:00 AM, the defamation case filed by Sun Nanshou, Sun Herong, and Sun Darong against the Ren Dao Xin Min three newspapers was heard in the Shandi District Court by Judge Liu Bingzhen. None of the three plaintiffs appeared, only their representative, Gu Yiliang. The defendants, Xu Xiyin (Xin Min Bao), Qian Xiaoyun (Guomin Dao Bao), and Ji Xilin (Ren Bao), all appeared as summoned, and were represented by lawyers Zhou Beiwu, Tang Ying, and Wang Tinghuai. At the same time, Ji Xilin of the Ren Bao filed a counterclaim against Sun Herong for false accusation. After Judge Liu questioned them individually, he attempted to persuade Gu Yiliang, the plaintiff's representative, to reach a settlement, but Gu firmly refused. At this point, Tang Ying, the defendant's lawyer, stated that if the plaintiffs insisted on litigation, the court should order the plaintiffs themselves to appear, otherwise their representative's persistent refusal to settle would be suspiciously suggestive of inciting litigation. As a result, the court returned the original documents to both parties to attempt a settlement outside the court.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>

Zhu Kaichou, the manager of the company, drove his car to Changshu a few days ago to inspect the route and also visited Suzhou to inspect the branch line. He seemed satisfied. On the 13th, he went to Wuxi to meet with Mei Chengzhang, the engineering director, to discuss the handover of the highway. It is understood that the Construction Department has scheduled the official handover of the entire line for the 15th of this month, to be taken over by the Xi-Hu Motor Company.

<p>Regicide of Mother in Luyuan, Sentenced to Death</p>
<p>Xu Jinfu, who murdered his mother in Luyuan Township in this county, has been sentenced to death by the county government. However, Xu seems to suffer from mental illness, and after hearing the sentence, he declared in court that he would appeal. Xu Jinfu is from Xipei Township in Luyuan. His father's name is Hebao, and his mother's name is Qian. She was usually very strict with him, and he often harbored resentment. On the evening of June 13th, Jinfu argued with his mother over the issue of eating rice dumplings, and then used a kitchen knife to slash her repeatedly, inflicting as many as seven wounds. Qian died immediately. When his father returned from the fields and found Qian lying dead in a pool of blood, he tried to find the murderer and brought him to the county government. Xu Jinfu feigned ignorance and deafness, as if he were mentally ill, but he confessed to killing his mother. When he was taken to the detention center, Jinfu was very strong and broke two pairs of handcuffs in an attempt to escape. Four jailers were assigned to guard him day and night, so nothing happened. The county judiciary, in accordance with Article 283, paragraph 1, and Article 272, paragraph 1, of the old criminal law, comparing the severity of the offenses, applied the law in effect at the time of the judgment and sentenced him to death for killing a direct ascendant relative, and deprived him of his civil rights for life.</p>

The bandits fired shots, ordered the bus to stop, boarded the bus, and robbed all the passengers, men and women. Zhou Liangqiu, a messenger from the Zhe-Gan Railway, resisted and was shot dead. After obtaining the loot, the bandits fled east. The Yiyang Bus Station immediately reported the incident by telephone to all stations. Buses traveling to and from the area were temporarily suspended. Li, the stationmaster in Guixi, urgently reported the incident to the 57th Division Command stationed in Guixi. Dean Ruan urgently ordered Company Commander Li of the Special Service Company to lead a team by car to pursue the bandits. At 5:30 PM, they spotted the bandits more than ten miles east of Yiyang. They opened fire, and the bandits fled into the mountains. However, one of the bandits, Shi Qingcai, was shot in the leg and fell to the ground. He was captured and taken back to Guixi. At 10:00 PM, he was interrogated by Li Jutang, the chief of the military law office. The bandit confessed to the robbery. He was temporarily sent to the military hospital for treatment and detention. The Nanchang Pacification Headquarters was also notified by telegram to request instructions on how to proceed. Traffic on the Zhe-Gan Highway resumed normally on the eleventh.</p>

<h3>President Wang Flew to Qingdao Yesterday Morning for Convalescence; Madam Wang, Chu Minyi, and Others Accompany; Minister Kong and Mayor Wu Saw Him Off</h3>
<p>President Wang, who was admitted to the Noel Hospital in Shanghai on the first of this month due to inflammation of the gallbladder, has made good progress after two weeks of treatment. His fever has subsided slightly, but the source of the illness in the gallbladder remains. Wang also has a history of gastrointestinal and diabetic problems, making the situation complex. Without several weeks of fundamental treatment, these conditions are prone to relapse at any time. Recently, the weather in Shanghai has become increasingly hot, making treatment difficult. Since the 11th, Wang's pulse has occasionally stopped five to six times per minute. Following doctor's orders, he relocated to Qingdao for convalescence yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, traveling by Douglas aircraft. As Wang's gallbladder inflammation has not fully healed, he was unable to get out of bed. He was transported to the airport in a Red Cross ambulance. Accompanying him were Dr. Noel, Chen Bijun, Chu Minyi, and others. Executive Yuan Vice President Kong Xianxi, Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo, and others came to the airport to see him off. According to the doctor, the climate in Qingdao is more suitable for Wang than Shanghai. However, Wang needs four to five weeks of strict rest and treatment in Qingdao to restore his strength and prevent a recurrence.</p>

<h3>National Goods League</h3>
<p>The National Goods League Committee, concerned about the difficulties faced by Shanghai's industry and commerce, requested the Ministry of Industry to provide immediate relief to factories that have been shut down or are facing closure. The reply was received yesterday, stating that the Ministry is aware of the situation and has consulted with the Ministry of Finance regarding the financial aspects. Previously, the Committee had telegraphed the Ministry about the situation, and the Ministry had increased the capital of banks and stipulated ten principles for lending to assist industry and commerce, and had ordered the banks to follow these principles. In the months since then, the number of new loans and extensions of existing loans by various banks and money houses has exceeded the original limit. Recently, Chen Guangfu, Chairman of the Shanghai Banking Association, and others stated that many businesses continue to request loans from banks and money houses for relief. Representatives such as Zhang Zilian also reported similar situations. The Ministry has instructed the banks and money houses to continue to process applications and has allocated 20 million yuan in national treasury bonds as secondary collateral for the banks and money houses to provide loans to industry and commerce in accordance with the ten principles promulgated by the Ministry. The Shanghai Money House Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Central, China, and Communications Banks have been instructed to implement these measures. The request for assistance to industry and commerce should still be handled in accordance with the lending principles set by the Ministry. A reply was also received stating that the Ministry has determined methods of assisting industry and commerce and should proceed accordingly. To address the root causes, the Ministry has been implementing the Industrial Incentive Law and the Machine-Made Goods Tax Law to foster industrial production. Since the cotton spinning industry is a vital sector in Shanghai, a relief meeting was convened to discuss relief measures in detail. Regarding other industries, the Ministry is actively discussing the unified management plan submitted by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, after reviewing it and soliciting opinions from various parties. A notification will be issued once a decision is reached and approved.</p>

Special class will be charged at the first-class rate, first-class at the second-class rate, and second-class at the third-class rate.

<h3>Foreign Merchants Disapprove of Tea Industry Control, Believing Control Measures Will Be Difficult to Implement</h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the sales of Chinese tea in the international market are declining year by year. The reasons for this are partly due to the encroachment of Ceylon tea and partly due to the many shortcomings of Chinese tea itself. Therefore, the Ministry of Industry has repeatedly sent personnel to various countries for on-site investigations to seek improvements. At the same time, it also plans to control the tea industry. It is said that preparations are currently underway. Foreign tea companies are quite alarmed, but since the matter has not yet been implemented, there has been no immediate response. Yesterday, a foreign tea merchant said that although the Chinese government's plan to control the tea industry has not been officially announced, it is rumored that its purpose is to raise the price of Chinese tea and set the tea price itself. From the perspective of tea merchants, such measures may not be effective. Currently, Indian tea is being dumped in large quantities, regardless of price, and the goods can be paid for on credit, with payment deferred for up to twelve months. However, it is already difficult to sell Chinese tea on credit. Foreign merchants find this inconvenient. If prices are raised again, foreign distributors will inevitably be helpless, and the sales of Chinese tea will likely decline further.</p>
<h3>Commodity Inspection Bureau Announces Inspection of Exported Hemp Products, Effective from the 20th of This Month</h3>

All hemp products exported from Shanghai must be inspected and qualified by this bureau before customs clearance is allowed. In addition to enclosing the detailed rules for implementation and sending them to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce for distribution, this notice is hereby issued for public information."</p>
<h3>Xu Shiying and Others to Depart This Morning to Inspect Disaster Areas, Tentative Schedule for Inspecting Disaster Areas in Various Provinces; Shanghai to Establish Flood Relief Association</h3>
<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, Mr. Xu Shiying, chairman of the National Government Relief Committee, remained in Shanghai yesterday due to business. He boarded a ship at 11 p.m. last night with Huang Bodu, Hu Mai, Zhou, section chief of the Relief Committee, and his son, a total of five people. Before his departure, Mr. Xu told reporters from the Xinsheng News Agency and showed them the inspection schedule: today (16th) in Jiangsu Province, 17th to Nanjing, evening to Wuhu, 18th to Anqing, afternoon to Jiujiang, 19th to Hankou, 20th to Changsha, 22nd to Hankou. He will return to Nanjing within the month to attend the establishment meetings of the disaster relief preparation committees in Jingbao and other places. When asked about disaster relief measures by the Xinsheng News Agency reporter, Mr. Xu replied that although the government's disaster relief reserve for this year is two million, the Legislative Yuan has resolved that each province must also have its own disaster relief reserve, with the central government only playing a supplementary role. Therefore, of the two million, only one million can actually be used for emergency needs. He (Xu Shiying) will discuss relief measures with the authorities of each province during this trip. A flood relief association will be established in Shanghai in the near future to start fundraising. It is currently confident of raising about ten thousand yuan, which will be used for emergency relief in the most severely affected areas first. It is also learned that Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan have all telegraphed Shanghai in the past two days, requesting Mr. Xu to set off for inspection as soon as possible.</p>

The progress of each team was very diligent, and the collection of donations from various industries was also very smooth, which shows the enthusiasm of all sectors of the city for support. It is hoped that each field director will continue to work hard to assist the captains, vice-captains, and members of each solicitation team. The collection of donations from various industries should also be intensified. For the convenience of work, the field directors have been reassigned according to the situation of each industry, and this has been approved. It is hoped that everyone will work hard. The collection of donations from various hotels has been carried out, but some C and D-level hotels are not working hard enough, or they collect donations intermittently. After the previous convening of the hotel fundraising meeting, the office inspected and persuaded them, and most hotels are now working hard to collect donations. However, attention should be paid during the inspection to the business situation of the hotel. If there are D-level hotels that are indeed in a slump and cannot maintain operations, then the situation should be considered and a portion or all of the pledged donations should be waived to alleviate the difficulties of the businesses. Also, the methods for collecting donations from various dance halls have been decided and sent to each dance hall, and it is planned to start implementation on the 20th of this month. Each dance hall will collect donations on behalf of the association, according to the methods of each industry, and one person will be assigned to be responsible for inspection in each venue.

<h3>Joint Association of Five Stockbrokers Asks for the Elimination of Illegal External Organizations; Yesterday's Letter to the Joint Association of Five Exchanges Asks for Submission to Competent Authorities for Strict Prohibition</h3>
<p>Recently, the Joint Association of Brokers' Associations of the Five Exchanges in Shanghai has discovered an illegal commercial organization that is similar to gambling, specializing in accepting entrusted trading of goods such as gold and yarn. The nature of the business is similar to that of the exchanges, but it uses small amounts as units, such as one bar of gold (the minimum for trading gold at the Gold Exchange is seven bars) and one bale of yarn. They are visionary, taking commissions to make profits, attracting general improper merchants, and greatly affecting the business of each exchange. Yesterday, they jointly sent a letter to the Joint Association of the Five Exchanges, requesting that it be submitted to the competent authorities for strict prohibition. The original letter reads: "To whom it may concern, this is based on the proposal of the Brokers' Association of the Gold Exchange of our members, for the elimination of illegal external organizations that accept entrusted trading of goods such as gold and cotton yarn for fixed-term transactions. All members believe that this type of illegal organization attracts improper merchants to entrust trading with small amounts as units, taking commissions to make profits, and is similar to gambling. It not only harms society and hinders public order, but also disrupts market prices, which greatly damages the functions and reputation of the exchanges. If it is allowed to grow over time, the consequences are unimaginable. Moreover, Article 16 of the Exchange Law stipulates that no one may engage in the business of acting as an agent, introducing, or transmitting exchange transactions. This type of organization is not permitted by law and has no reason to exist. Therefore, we dare to request that your association preside over the matter and submit the situation to the competent authorities for strict prohibition and order to close down, in order to uphold the law and maintain business. This is what we pray for."</p>

<h3>French Concession: Merchant Rent Reduction Movement; Caishi Road Delegation Notifies Shops; Self-Relief Road Follows Suit Requesting Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Shops on Caishi Road in the French Concession, due to the sluggish market and the impact of the French Tram Company's road construction, are experiencing exceptionally poor business, making it difficult to sustain. Therefore, they have unanimously launched a request for relief from the French authorities, seeking, at the very least, exemption from property taxes during the road construction period. They also convened a general meeting to determine rent reduction standards, requesting landlords to reduce rent in order to maintain business. It is now learned that the delegation from Caishi Road issued a special notice to all shops on the road yesterday, urging them to comply with the resolution and sending representatives to investigate the business losses of each shop due to the road construction, in order to have a basis for negotiation. It is also heard that shops on Self-Relief Road, also suffering significant losses due to road construction, have elected representatives to join the Caishi Road delegation to hold a joint meeting to discuss rent reduction methods. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Notice to Shops</p>
<p>The Caishi Road Shop Rent Reduction Delegation issued a notice to the shops yesterday, stating: "We hereby inform you that the shops on this road have been suffering from sluggish business due to the poor market, and since the road construction by the French Tram Company, the inconvenience of traffic and the accumulation of mud have caused pedestrians to disappear, greatly affecting business. If no measures are taken to remedy the situation, it will inevitably be impossible to sustain business. Therefore, we have launched a road-wide request for exemption from property taxes during the road construction period and rent reduction as a minimum, and have jointly written to the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the French Concession and the Citizens' Association to appeal for relief. We are now transcribing the various requirements and measures decided at the shop representative meeting on the 4th of this month (the resolution is omitted from the previous report). The above measures were unanimously approved. In addition to our delegation petitioning Mr. Du, Chairman of the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the French Concession, and the Chinese Directors, who have agreed to take responsibility for handling the matter, we should wait for the response from Mr. Du and Mr. Zhang. Regarding rent reduction measures, they should be implemented from today. This notice is specifically issued in the record, and we hope everyone will comply with it. This is to notify you."</p>
<p>Joint Meeting</p>
<p>Shops on Self-Relief Road, due to high rents that are difficult to bear, and because the road has now begun construction, suffering the same pain as Caishi Road, have specifically elected representatives Zhang Chuan, Cen Zhiliang, etc., to seek relief and take consistent action with the shops on Caishi Road. At 4:00 PM yesterday, a joint meeting of representatives from the two roads was held at the Yanxin Temple on Self-Relief Road. Representing Caishi Road were Fang, Li Zhengdong, Wang Yugan, Feng Guomin, He Yaozhang, Yu, Wang Xixiang, Lu Jinbiao, and others, totaling nine people. Representatives from Self-Relief Road, Cen Zhiliang, Xia Shanxiao, Zhang Zhuchuan, Sun Ruiting, etc., jointly elected He Yaozhang as chairman. After reporting on the progress of the petition and the work situation, discussions began on: (1) Whether to organize a rent reduction association to actively promote the rent reduction case.

<p>Request for Assistance</p>
<p>Yesterday, the association sent letters to various organizations and businesses requesting assistance. The original text of the letter reads: "We hereby inform you that the Municipal Council of the Public Concession has made a resolution to double the tax on our industry. We believe that we work hard every day and our livelihood is already barely sufficient. How can we bear this new tax? We have already sent letters to the Municipal Council and the Chinese Directors of the Taxpayers Association, expressing our firm opposition. The original letter stated, 'The rickshaw industry relies on physical strength to transport goods for customers. We earn our living with our sweat and blood. This time, the Municipal Council does not consider the current difficulties and has decided to increase the tax on our industry by 100%. The entire industry is in a state of panic and shock. We cannot accept this and dare to state the reasons as follows: (1) The cost of manufacturing each rickshaw is only about twenty yuan. After the tax increase, the total annual tax for all four seasons will exceed the manufacturing cost. If all kinds of freight vehicles on the market are subject to taxes exceeding their manufacturing cost, what will that mean? Why are we rickshaws being treated so harshly? (2) Since the emergence of trucks in the market, the business scope of our rickshaw industry has been driven by the environment and has become extremely narrow, showing signs of unsustainability. After the house leaks, how can we withstand the wind and rain? (3) This city is a metropolis in East Asia. Recently, it has been attacked by the wave of economic depression from abroad. Internally, there are both droughts and floods, and rural areas are bankrupt. The impact has been felt by all industries, and our industry suffers the most from the sharp decline in passengers and goods. (4) Today, the needs of industry and commerce are rent reduction and tax reduction to ease the burden. Only in this way can we support the precarious situation and avoid overall collapse. Therefore, some landlords are automatically reducing rent. In order to ensure public safety, the authorities should appropriately reduce taxes to adapt to the situation and avoid the continued expansion of unemployment. The tax on our rickshaw industry is already 2.5 yuan per quarter, which is particularly heavy compared to other freight vehicle industries. How can we increase it further, let alone increase it to 5 yuan? (5) In terms of vehicles supplying the market, trucks are indeed agile and fast for transporting goods. However, if there are not many goods, it is economically unreasonable to hire a truck. If ordinary manual carts are used instead, they are too heavy and may easily overturn. The most suitable and stable option is still our rickshaws. Therefore, the existence of rickshaws has objective conditions. Since it is needed by the market, how can we destroy it with unbearable taxes? (6) The number of rickshaws in the city is estimated to be around 12,000, and the number of people who directly and indirectly rely on this for a living is no less than 100,000. Now, due to the tax increase, they are forced to become unemployed and lose their source of livelihood, which will inevitably increase social hidden dangers. In summary, considering the current situation and the special circumstances of our industry, there is no reason to increase taxes when we are trying to reduce them. As representatives of the entire city's rickshaw industry, we express our grievances regarding this tax increase resolution and respectfully ask you to consider our difficulties and quickly strive to persuade the Municipal Council to cancel the tax increase resolution. The industry will be fortunate, and society will be fortunate.' We have always admired your association's enthusiasm for public welfare and upholding justice. You will surely rise up and sympathize with and stop this measure that destroys manual labor and increases the social crisis. We are writing to you accordingly and respectfully hope for your kind assistance and look forward to your reply."</p>
<p>Handcart Opposition</p>
<p>The negotiation by the rickshaw industry in this city to oppose the Municipal Council's vehicle office's tax increase has not yet been resolved. The Municipal Council's vehicle office has recently decided to increase the tax on handcarts in this city by one-half of the original tax. This has also caused the same reaction from the city's handcart operators. A gentleman in the industry advocated contacting the rickshaw industry to oppose it together and sent representatives to the Rickshaw Mutual Aid Association to discuss it. The Rickshaw Mutual Aid Association expressed its support. At 3:00 PM yesterday, the handcart operators held a representative meeting at No. 1, Lane 650, Rehe Road. It was resolved to unanimously oppose the tax increase and the following steps were decided: (1) Write to the Concession Taxpayers Association to negotiate with the Municipal Council on their behalf. (2) Notify all handcart operators in the city to unanimously oppose the tax increase. (3) Join the Rickshaw Mutual Aid Association to take consistent action and strengthen their power. (4) Suspend all tax payments until the negotiation is resolved.</p>
<h3>Gastrointestinal Diseases Continue to Increase: Residents Should Be Vigilant About Flies</h3>
<p>According to a recent report from the Municipal Council's Health Department, the mortality rate in the Shanghai Public Concession in June of this year was lower than in the same month last year. Various respiratory infectious diseases, except for scarlet fever, have been greatly reduced. However, gastrointestinal diseases are gradually increasing. According to Dr. Jordan's view, this increase in diseases naturally comes with the summer season and is not surprising. Because during the summer season, various ice drinks, sliced and sold fruits, etc., are everywhere. Residents who do not pay attention and casually buy and eat them are likely to get sick. However, in addition to this, cleanliness and hygiene should also be strived for at home. The danger of flies should be especially guarded against. In addition, typhoid fever also showed a continuing increase in mid-June, which is very disturbing to the residents of the concession. However, this is not related to drinking water, but is caused by improper food handling and the spread of germs by flies. If residents can pay attention to fly control facilities for outdoor garbage bins, kitchens, and storage rooms at all times, the benefits to public health will be greatly effective. Furthermore, it can be additionally explained here that the installation of window screens should be chosen with relatively sparse meshes, as sparse meshes facilitate air circulation. Although they cannot prevent mosquitoes from flying in, they are more than sufficient to prevent flies, and those who are in them do not need to open the doors from time to time to let in air, which would allow flies to enter through the gaps.</p>
<h3>Fengtian Maru: Japanese Woman Commits Suicide by Jumping into the Sea; Silent, With a Sorrowful Expression, Suddenly Missing, Leaving Behind Slippers</h3>
<p>According to the Koukou Daily News, on the 11th, on the Fengtian Maru of the Dalian Steamship Company, sailing from this port to Qingdao, a third-class passenger, a woman about 30 years old, suddenly went missing, causing a great commotion on the ship. A telegram was sent to the Consulate General to report. The investigation revealed that around 10:00 AM on the 11th, as the ship was about to set sail, a woman hurriedly bought a ticket from the company. The name on the register was Kawakami Sato, 29 years old, living at No. 25, Peng Road. She rushed to the ship immediately. When the ship was about to arrive in Qingdao, the woman suddenly disappeared. Later, a pair of straw slippers were found on the deck, indicating that she had committed suicide by jumping into the sea. According to the shipmate in the same room, the woman remained silent after boarding the ship, with a sorrowful expression on her face. The Japanese Consulate in this port, upon receiving the report, immediately sent police to No. 25, Peng Road to inquire, but there was no woman named Kawakami Sato living there.</p>
<h3>West Baoxing Road: Police and Thieves Engage in a Gunfight; Two Thieves Captured One After the Other</h3>
<p>A certain opium den on West Baoxing Road in Zhabei, at about 10:40 AM yesterday, suddenly had two men get off their bicycles in front of the store, appearing to be shopping. Unexpectedly, the two men stepped into the store and took out guns, threatening the store owner to hand over money, attempting to rob the store. Fortunately, this was seen by the store's neighbors and passersby, who reported it to the police officer at post No. 21, who immediately blew his whistle and rushed to arrest them. The bandits, upon learning that their plot had been exposed, did not have time to rob and turned to flee towards Baoyuan Road. At that time, the police officer also chased after them with a gun. However, the two bandits could not ride their bicycles, nor could they drag them along, so they abandoned the two bicycles on the roadside and fled on their own. Seeing that the police officer chasing behind was approaching, they became anxious and turned around and fired two shots to resist arrest. Fortunately, the chasing police officer dodged quickly and was not hit. The chasing police officer also returned fire with three shots, which also missed. At this time, the Yongxing Road police station had received the alert and immediately dispatched a large number of armed police officers to assist in the pursuit. Seeing the police officers gathering, the bandits turned around to resist stubbornly, causing a gunfight between the two sides. For a time, bullets flew around and pedestrians scrambled to avoid them. The two bandits fought and ran until they reached the entrance of Lan'an Lane, when one of the bandits suddenly lost his footing and fell to the ground. The chasing police officer rushed up and captured him, seizing a gun and four bullets. The other bandit took the opportunity to escape. The police officers took the captured bandit, the gun, the bicycle, etc., to the Baoshan Road North Station Police Bureau. After interrogation by the Branch Director Liang Fuchu, it was learned that the bandit's name was Gu Shaoyun, 30 years old, from Haimen. At the same time, he also confessed the address where his escaped accomplice was hiding. Director Liang immediately ordered detectives to go with the Public Concession police to the Hujiang No. 1 Hotel on Henan Road and arrested Chen Zhihao in room No. 13. He was taken back to the North Station Branch Bureau that day and reported to the General Bureau for legal action.</p>
<h3>Suspicious Death of Brother: Requesting Court Autopsy; Autopsy Reveals Death Due to Illness</h3>
<p>Zhao Yisheng, a 43-year-old man from Sanlintang, Pudong, suffered from a nervous disorder more than 20 years ago. Unable to be cured, he was sent to the Shanghai Mental Hospital at No. 7, Lane 888, Kangnaot Road on March 14 of this year by his wife Zhao Ding and others for treatment. The treatment was ineffective, and he died of exhaustion the previous morning. When Ding and others were carrying the body to the Wan Guo Funeral Home, the deceased's brother, Zhao Zhibai, suspected his brother's death, so he filed a complaint with the Shanghai District Court and reported it to the Gordon Road police station, requesting an autopsy. After dispatching Chinese and Western inspectors to investigate, the body was transferred to the autopsy center on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, the prosecutor appointed by the District Court of the First Special District, accompanied by two forensic doctors, Wei and Zhang, and court clerk Wang Zuyi, arrived at the center to examine the body. Zhao Ding claimed that she lived in Pudong and was currently residing at No. 52, Xin Dazhan Road. The deceased was her husband, who had suffered from a nervous disorder for 22 years and died in the hospital the previous morning. She had a daughter with him. Zhao Zhibai claimed that he was 37 years old, a real estate businessman, and currently residing at No. 3, Dexing Lane, West Xinqiao. The deceased was his brother, who died the previous morning. He had several doubts: When his brother was seriously ill, Ding did not inform him. Furthermore, he was given an orange at 9:00 AM and died at 10:00 AM. When he arrived at the Wan Guo Funeral Home at 4:00 PM, he was not allowed to see his brother's body. Therefore, he reported it to the police station requesting an autopsy. After obtaining the testimony, Mr. Guo concluded that the body had been examined by a forensic doctor and was found to have died of illness during his lifetime. The body was released to his wife Zhao Ding, who signed a bond to take it back for burial.</p>
<h3>Yang Zhaosong, Suffering From Illness and厭世, Jumped From a Window and Died; Autopsy Conducted by the Court Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yang Zhaosong, a 39-year-old man from Anhui, worked as an electrician. Recently, he suffered from a severe illness. Although he sought medical treatment, he could not recover. A few days ago, he went to the China Sanatorium Hospital at No. 279, Bazilu Road for treatment and stayed in a ward on the first floor of the hospital. Unexpectedly, around 1:00 AM the previous morning, Yang suddenly resented that his sick body was difficult to cure and conceived a desire to leave the world. He secretly walked to the window and committed suicide by jumping from the building. The Chinese police officer on patrol No. 3385 from the Hongkou police station investigated and found that he had suffered severe injuries to his head and other parts of his body and was barely breathing. The police officer called a rescue vehicle and rushed him to Tongren Hospital. Medical treatment was ineffective, and he died shortly after. Under investigation by the police station in charge, it was learned that the deceased was a solitary person and only had a friend, Yao A'da, in Shanghai, who currently lived in Zhabei. The deceased had been seeking treatment at the hospital for this illness for only five days, and had refused to eat for three days. He was the only person living in the ward where he was staying. The hospital's nurses would routinely visit his room to check on him. A few minutes before the incident, they had also visited him and saw that he was lying peacefully in bed, so they did not expect him to take such a drastic measure. The body was transported to the autopsy center on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, the prosecutor appointed by the District Court of the First Special District, arrived at the center to examine the body. After the police officers reported the situation, Mr. Guo concluded that the deceased Yang Zhaosong, a male, had died from head injuries sustained from a fall during his lifetime. The body was allowed to be claimed for burial by his friend Yao A'da after signing a bond.</p>
<h3>Great China Tragedy: Court to Open Trial Soon; Hunger Strike in Factory Stopped After Persuasion; Support Association Held Emergency Meeting Last Night</h3>
<p>Residents of Yongqing Lane, Xiaoshadu, who were burned and injured, had 28 people in the first batch examined by the court. Yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, the family support association sent members to accompany another nine injured people to the Prosecutor's Office of the First Special Court to request an examination. The remaining 35 people who had not been examined decided to stop the examination because various hospitals had already issued injury reports. At the same time, the victims remained in the factory. The family support association learned that the victims were planning to go on a hunger strike yesterday, so this morning they sent all members of the committee into the factory to persuade the victims to stop the hunger strike and wait for the authorities to resolve the matter. The First Special Court, based on the victims' complaints, scheduled the trial to open in the Eighth Criminal Court at 4:00 PM this afternoon. The family support association held an emergency meeting last night to discuss the steps to be taken.</p>
<h3>Severe Wind and Rain Last Night: Lasting Half an Hour</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of summer this year, the weather has been relatively stable, except for more rainfall. However, since the 12th of this month, it has suddenly become extremely hot. The Fahrenheit thermometer rose sharply to 108 degrees on the day before yesterday (the 14th). Yesterday morning felt even more oppressive. Sales of melons and cold drinks in various places were ten times higher than usual. Asphalt roads were softened, marking the first extreme heat of the year. Unexpectedly, around 7:45 PM last night, a strong wind suddenly rose, and the momentum was extremely violent. Many glass windows, shop signs, and objects on various roads were blown down and destroyed. Passersby rushed to avoid them. In less than a quarter of an hour, a torrential rain suddenly fell, as if pouring from a basin, lasting for half an hour. After the rain, the sky cleared, the strong wind also stopped, and the climate suddenly became cool and pleasant. However, when the wind god suddenly arrived, Cao Wendao (30 years old) from Suzhou happened to be passing by the intersection of Renji Road on the Bund and was hit by a falling glass window, breaking his forehead and causing serious injuries. The police officer who saw this reported it, and the rescue vehicle from the Central Fire Brigade arrived and took him to the hospital for treatment. Furthermore, the electric wires from Menggu Road to Xinjiang Road in Zhabei were damaged by the wind and went out for a long time. After repairs, they were restored to light.</p>
<h3>The Money Shop Never Opened; the Whereabouts of the Share Money is Unknown. Zhu Ziyun Sues Xi Qisun and Others for Embezzlement, Claiming Losses of Over Seven Thousand Yuan</h3>
<p>Xi Qisun, the manager of the closed Rongkang Money Shop, along with deputy managers Qin Guangzhao, Zhu Pinsheng, and others, were recently sued by Zhu Ziyun (号 Xiangshan), a renowned throat doctor, who retained lawyer Lu Qi to file a complaint with the First District Court's Criminal Division, accusing them of breach of trust and embezzlement. He also filed a civil suit seeking to recover 7,500 foreign dollars. The traditional Chinese medicine doctor Ding Jiwan was also listed as a person of interest. The case stems from last winter when Zhu Ziyun met Qin Guangzhao, the Rongkang Money Shop's assistant manager, at the home of his colleague Ding Jiwan. Qin Guangzhao learned that Zhu had about 8,000 yuan deposited with Rongkang that he had not withdrawn. Qin Guangzhao claimed that Rongkang's business was still reasonably good but that the shareholders' opinions were not very compatible, so they would close sooner or later. He, along with Xi Qisun, Zhu Pinsheng, and others, were in the process of organizing a new Rongkang Fengji Money Shop and had already begun raising capital. Mr. Ding had also joined and persuaded Zhu Ziyun to invest in Fengji Zhuang as a shareholder. Ding Jiwan vouched for it, stating that he had already subscribed for 30,000 yuan and that Zhu might as well join. Zhu was misled and subscribed for 7,500 yuan under Ding's name. It was agreed that the payment would be made on November 26 of last year at Ding's place, where Ding would issue a receipt. A Rongkang promissory note for 7,500 yuan, dated December 1 of last year, would be paid. After the defendants received the money, they never issued a formal share certificate or receipt. When the newly organized Rongkang Fengji Money Shop did not open in the New Year, Zhu inquired by telegram and was told that the new shop could only open after Rongkang closed. This was just a prevarication. On January 30 of this year, Rongkang suddenly announced its closure, so Zhu thought that Fengji should be able to open. Unexpectedly, the defendants did not save Zhu's 7,500 yuan share money in other banks or money shops as agreed but instead, breached their trust and used it for their own purposes without authorization. When the old Rongkang collapsed, the defendants avoided meeting Zhu and moved from their original residences, their whereabouts unknown. This constitutes a violation of Articles 336, Clause 2 and 342 of the Criminal Law. Zhu has also filed a civil suit to recover the 7,500 yuan he paid. Judge Yang held a court hearing yesterday afternoon. Due to unclear addresses, the summonses to the three defendants could not be served. Only the person of interest, Ding Jiwan, appeared in court and stated that the shop had a liquidation office in Jixiang Lane on Henan Road and that the defendants might go there for a few hours each day. Judge Yang then adjourned the case to the afternoon of the 26th, instructing the plaintiff to summon the defendants to court for further questioning.</p>
<h3>The "Dung King": Family Disputes Arise One After Another. Ma Chenshi Sues Ma Honggen, Accusing Him of Forgery.</h3>
<p>Ma Chenshi (wife of the deceased Ma Hongkui), the eldest daughter-in-law of the late "Dung King" Ma Fuqi and his wife A Gui Jie, is in a property dispute with her uncle-in-law Ma Honggen and Hongkui's concubine Wang A Da at the Second Special District Court. The court has conducted several inquiries, but the case is complex and remains unresolved. Furthermore, Zou Shi, Ma Hongkui's mistress, along with her son Jieshan, filed a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court against Ma Chenshi and her daughters to confirm their identities. The first instance judgment has just been made. Before one wave subsides, another rises. Ma Chenshi has recently retained a lawyer to file a complaint with the Second Special District Court's Criminal Division, accusing her uncle-in-law Ma Honggen and her husband's concubine Wang A Da of forgery. She claims that her late husband Hongkui was in charge of sanitation in the French Concession. Last year, when he fell ill, he believed that the sanitation work was important and could not be left unattended for a day. Moreover, at that time, the sanitation workers were demanding a raise, brewing a storm, and the situation was serious. Therefore, on August 12, Hongkui issued a contract of entrustment, handing it over to his younger brother Honggen to handle everything on his behalf. However, Hongkui passed away the day after the contract was signed (August 13). Later this year, after a family property dispute arose between the uncle and sister-in-law, Chenshi discovered that the original contract of entrustment stated that Honggen was entrusted to act as an agent for a term of six months. However, the contract of entrustment held by Honggen had been changed to have no term limit. Furthermore, the contract was originally written by Chen Guangyu, Chenshi's younger brother, at Honggen's bedside. The handwriting is different, and it bears Honggen's seal. This clearly shows that Honggen intended to occupy the position for a long time and forged the document. She requests that the court investigate and punish him according to the law. Yesterday morning at 10:00, Judge Sun Peng of the court summoned Ma Chenshi. Due to illness, her lawyer appeared on her behalf, stating the intent of the lawsuit. He also said that when Honggen took over the sanitation work, he wrote another document stating that he would subsidize his elder brother Hongkui's medical expenses with 1,000 foreign dollars. The whereabouts of this document are also unknown. Defendant Ma Honggen stated that the entrustment letter was written when his elder brother was seriously ill and handed to the now-deceased bookkeeper Wan Sanduo, who passed it on to him. The document was actually written by another bookkeeper Zhu Wenxuan, and his brother sealed the document. Ma Chenshi, and the witnesses Zhang Quansheng (also a bookkeeper for the Ma family), and Zhong Ming were all present and witnessed it. He vehemently denied the forgery. The court then summoned the witnesses. After discussion, the court announced the conclusion of the debate and set the date for judgment on the 29th of this month, before adjourning the court.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Ouyang Han Accused of Deception in a Bigamy Case; Case is Clear and Concluded in Court; Judgment Set for the 20th of This Month</h3>
<p>Wu Fuying, a woman from Huzhou residing at 58 Huaxingfang, Zhejiang Road, recently filed a complaint with the Procuratorate of the District Court against Ouyang Han (号 Zhaotian), a Guangdong native currently working as a lawyer (joined the Shanghai Bar Association as a member in June 1931), accusing him of abandoning her and deceiving her into a bigamous marriage. Prosecutor Du Jiasheng has concluded several investigations, and the defendant has been released on bail. Ouyang Han is being prosecuted by the Criminal Court for the crime of obstructing marriage, the summary of which states that in May 1931, the defendant Ouyang Han met Wu Fuying, an adult female doctor at Puyi Hospital, and falsely claimed that he had no wife at home,</p>
<p>Deceiving and Seducing Her into Adultery.</p>
<p>Subsequently, on June 28, at Wu Fuying's home in Xinkang Lane, Tangjia Lane, with Wu Fuying's parents presiding, two tables of relatives and friends were invited for a wedding ceremony. They once lived together at 1 Henglile Lane, Taian Street, outside the West Gate. This went on smoothly until April of this year, when Wu Fuying noticed a change in the defendant's temperament. After many inquiries, she learned that the defendant already had a wife living with him in his office at 383 Lujiahong. She then filed a complaint with the court about the bigamy and other matters (the reasons for the lawsuit and the articles of law violated). According to Wu Fuying,</p>
<p>the Testimony is Clear and Detailed.</p>
<p>Witness Zhang Wanfen testified that Wu Fuying and Ouyang Han were husband and wife and had been married. She went on the day of the wedding, lit incense and candles, bowed to the mother-in-law, and invited two tables of guests. Wu Fuying's younger brother Wu Dongyin gave the same testimony. The defendant wrote a note to Wu Fuying on August 16, 1934, in which Article 2 stated that (referring to Wu Fuying) "is my wife and has the right to inherit future property." There is no doubt that the defendant Ouyang Han and Wu Fuying were formally married. However, when questioned, the defendant vehemently denied it. No matter how much he tried to quibble, Ouyang Han, having a spouse,</p>
<p>Entered into Marriage Again,</p>
<p>which constitutes a violation of the first paragraph of Article 254 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday morning at 10:00, Judge Chen Kangsun specially opened the Fifth Court for trial. The plaintiff Wu Fuying retained a private prosecution lawyer to pursue a private suit, calculated at 200 yuan per month, seeking compensation for 30 years, totaling 72,000 yuan. If paid in a lump sum, it would require 50,000 yuan. First, Ouyang Han stated that he was 30 years old, from Meixian, Guangdong, and currently a lawyer with an office in Lujiabang. He and Wu Fuying were not formally husband and wife but did cohabitate. Because Fuying was at odds with his wife, Fuying once rushed to his office and</p>
<p>Quarreled Several Times.</p>
<p>Next, Wu Fuying stated that she was 29 years old, from Huzhou. The defendant met her in May 1931 and deceived her in every possible way, saying that he loved her very much. He said that he had no wife in his hometown and was very lonely in Shanghai. Seeing his diligence and care, she thought there was nothing to worry about. Therefore, they advanced from friendship to marriage. Because the defendant was a guest in a foreign land, the wedding procedures were very simple and lacked any rituals. On June 28 of the same year, they hastily married at home in Tangjia Lane,</p>
<p>Preparing Simple Incense and Candles.</p>
<p>The defendant bowed three times to her parents and invited more than a dozen relatives and friends who knew the details of their relationship to come to the house to witness the ceremony, with only two tables of wine and dishes prepared. Only now did she find out that the defendant still had a wife. When she knew she had been fooled, she argued with him, but instead, he abused her. This situation made her feel ashamed. As a lawyer, he used such cunning and deceptive means, which misled the plaintiff for life. She requested that he be punished according to the law and asked for a private prosecution for a minimum of 50,000 foreign dollars. Next, witness Zhang Wanfen testified that she was a classmate of the plaintiff and was present at their wedding. Wu Dongyin testified that Fuying was his elder sister and that after she had a relationship with Ouyang Han,</p>
<p>She Suddenly Became Pregnant.</p>
<p>Because it was a matter of face, she did not want to make a big show and hastily married, only lighting a pair of candles and preparing two tables of wine and dishes. The official asked how many months pregnant the plaintiff was at that time, and Wu replied about three or four months. The official said, "In that case, it could still be concealed, why be so hasty?" Wu replied that she really did not want to make things too public. At this point, Prosecutor Du Jiasheng came to court and presented his arguments. After one round of debate, the official asked Ouyang Han if he had anything to say in the end. He replied that he could still afford to subsidize the plaintiff with 20 foreign dollars per month for living expenses. The official asked if the case was clear and then concluded the debate, setting the judgment for the 20th of this month. The defendant remained on bail.</p>

<h3>Suspicious Passenger Reported by Rickshaw Puller; Turns Out to Be a Kidnapper; Abducted Woman Sent to Relief Society</h3>
<p>Chen Tangshi, a woman from Danyang, Gong Liben, and two others at large, were planning to send Cai Daliu, a 13-year-old girl from the same village, to Qingdao to be sold at around 3:00 AM the day before yesterday at the Huangpu Wharf on Yangshupu Road. A three-wheeled rickshaw puller found their behavior suspicious and reported them to the Chinese constable on duty at post 36. When questioned, they gave evasive answers. The Chinese constable took Chen Tangshi, Gong Liben, and Cai to the Huishan Police Station where they were held separately. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The Municipal Council's lawyer Wang Yaotang explained the background and stated that the girl's family had not yet arrived. He requested a postponement and that Cai be temporarily sent to the Jiliang Institute or the Women and Children Relief Society. According to Cai, she was brought to Shanghai by her father. The two defendants were from the same village and acted as matchmakers to marry her off to a Shandong man as an adopted daughter-in-law. Originally, there was a mother at home, but her father escaped at that time. When questioned, Chen Tangshi stated that Cai's father and her nephew, each named Long, knew each other and sold her to a Shandong man as a daughter-in-law for 52 foreign dollars. She received two dollars as a matchmaking fee, and the rest was taken away by the girl's father. Gong Liben stated that the matter was done by his nephew, Long, and he knew nothing about it, asking for leniency. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered them to be remanded to custody, and Cai was sent to the Women and Children Relief Society.</p>

<h3>The Ningbo Daily Hosted a Banquet for All Team Leaders Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Ningbo Daily's Second Solicitation for Members Assembly held a banquet at the Yizhi Xiang Western Restaurant yesterday at noon to honor team leaders and hold the first solicitation unveiling. Team leaders Huang Yexin, Shui Xiangyun, Shao Shixing, Peng, Zhengcheng, Chen Shengwu, Fang Jiaobo, Le Rucheng, Niao Yaqin, Shen Liucun, Zhang Jinglu, Chen Zhongfu, Zhou Jiaoqing, Wang Beiping, and over forty other people attended. The head of the team, Chu Qiaxiang, was unable to attend due to official business, and Zhou Jiaoqing represented him as chairman. The meeting opened as follows: The chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, stating that the newspaper had been published for three years and, through arduous struggles, had gained recognition from the general public of fellow villagers. They all believe that the newspaper is the only mouthpiece for our fellow Ningbo people living abroad and should be supported at all times. Therefore, the results of the first solicitation were very satisfactory. Now that the first term of membership is expiring, according to the resolution of the solicitation committee, the solicitation should be continued immediately. Three hundred fellow villagers have agreed to serve as team leaders. Although the market conditions are not good, fortunately, the expenses are few, and the methods have been changed. In addition to subscribing to the newspaper, the vouchers can also be used for advertising expenses. Therefore, the solicitation is easier than last year, and the results can be expected to be optimistic. Next, Chief Secretary Wang Beiping reported on the progress. Those who turned in their shares on the spot included Yin Yisheng 60, Fang Shiru 30, Huang Yexin 42, Shao Shixing 120, Shi Zushao 120, Chen Kongru 30, Ge Weian 30, Shi Yongxi 30, He Shaoyu and He Shaoting 120, Le Rucheng 60, Shu Xiaoen 18, Chen Zhongfu 120.

<h3>Xin Cun She Hosts a Welcoming Banquet for Xin Cun Residents Tonight at Xing Hua Lou; Xin Cun Costs Will Be Announced During the Banquet</h3>
<p>The Rose Garden Xin Cun, built by the China Xin Cun Construction Company founded by Du, has now taken shape and is expected to be fully completed by the end of the year. Mr. Zhang Yongnian, the founder of the company, feels that the opportunity for the residents of Xin Cun to gather together is too few, and that Xin Cun has progressed to the stage of announcing costs, so it is necessary to make all residents aware of the handling process. Therefore, he will host a welcoming banquet for all residents in Shanghai at Xing Hua Lou on Sima Road at 7:00 PM today to connect with each other's feelings. During the banquet, the founder will report on the past progress and future plans, the accountant will report on the accounts, the management committee will report on the management situation, the construction factory will report on the construction overview, and residents' opinions will be listened to. It is heard that the future direction of the company's business will be to cooperate effectively with the residents, pooling efforts and wisdom to increase efficiency.</p>
<h3>A Murdered Male Corpse Was Discovered in Farmland</h3>
<p>In the Chen family's farmland on Xiaomuqiao Road, Longhua Road in western Shanghai, a murdered male corpse was discovered at dawn yesterday. Someone reported it to the Fenglinqiao police station of the West Gate sub-bureau, which immediately ordered Zhang Lixiang, the local security officer of the 27th Bao, to report it to the District Court for an autopsy. After receiving the report, the court appointed Prosecutor Tang Ruxiu and Inspector Shen Qixiu to go to the scene for an inspection in the afternoon. The deceased was about 20 years old, bare-chested, wearing blue cloth pants, black socks, and black cloth shoes, resembling a worker. There were two ax wounds on the back of his head, and his skull was split open, with brain matter flowing out, a horrific sight. It was clear that he died from the injuries. The coroner's report stated that, since no family members came to claim the body, the funeral home was ordered to provide a coffin and collect the body, pending the arrest of the murderer and investigation. A notice was issued for family members to claim the body for burial.</p>
<h3>Promotion of Staff at the French Concession Police Department</h3>

<h3>Clothing Store Apprentice How Did He Die? Awaiting Autopsy</h3>
<p>Li Kouzi, a boy of 15 years old, was from Yangzhou. His parents were deceased. He was an apprentice at the Chen Linxing clothing store at 303 Avenue Jassand in the French Concession. Last month, he suffered from beriberi, causing swelling in both feet, and also suffered from internal organ diseases, making him unable to work. On the 6th of last month, his master sent him to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Later, the French Police found out that Li Kouzi had been abused and beaten by his master, causing injuries. The master was arrested and sent to the Second Special District Court, where he was publicly prosecuted for assault. The result of the trial was that there was no evidence of abuse or beating by his master, so the verdict was declared innocent. However, Li Kouzi was treated in the hospital for more than 30 days and eventually died in the hospital at 8:00 AM on the 14th of this month due to ineffective treatment. His master was notified, and at 8:00 AM yesterday morning, he prepared a coffin and went to the hospital to collect the body. At the same time, the hospital routinely reported to the French Police. After the police sent investigators to investigate, the body had already been placed in a coffin. The investigators reported the information to the head of the police, who ordered the coffin to be sent to the Tongren Fuyuan branch for an autopsy, awaiting a prosecutor from the Second Special District Court to conduct an autopsy today. At 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, the French Police ordered the coffin to be opened, the body removed, and photographs taken for investigation. Whether the deceased died of illness or was indeed beaten and injured before his death and died due to ineffective treatment must be clarified after a detailed autopsy by the prosecutor and a forensic doctor.</p>
<h3>Former Policeman Punished for Watching a Free Show and Committing Assault</h3>
<p>Wu Xiaoting, a man, went to the Huasheng Jiangbei Theater at 583 Pingliang Road with a man and a woman at about 8:00 PM the day before yesterday to watch a show without paying. Yang Changsong, a ticket seller from Yancheng, questioned him, and Wu yelled loudly, claiming to be a police officer from the Public Security Bureau and a shareholder of the theater. A verbal dispute ensued. Wu used a porcelain teapot to smash Yang's head and punched and kicked him. Yang was injured and fell to the ground, calling for help. Ruan Taibin, a Chinese detective of the Yulin Road Police Station, and Chinese constable No. 3047 arrived after hearing the alarm and arrested him. He was taken to the police station along with the teapot. Wu falsely claimed to be a police officer named Wang Shaohe, No. 4689, from the First Division of the First District, and accused the plaintiff of questioning him and beating him, claiming that his head was injured by himself. The police chief ordered him to be detained, and the injured person was sent to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the First District. The Municipal Council's lawyer, Zheng Yaotang, stated that the defendant was indeed a police officer in the Public Security Bureau in the Nanshi district two years ago but was dismissed for some reason. Wang Shaohe, No. 4689, is indeed a police officer, but he is a friend. His real name is Wu Xiaoting. Please punish him severely. Next, the victim Yang Changsong testified about what happened. When questioned, the defendant's statements were evasive. Judge Mei Zizhi sentenced Wu Xiaoting to six months of imprisonment to warn others.</p>
<h3>Public Security Bureau Sends a Letter to the Municipal Party Department to Thoroughly Investigate the Qingdiao Sympathy Confraternity; Reportedly Using Its Name to Collect Money</h3>
<p>Cai Jingjun, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, reported that gangsters (commonly known as the "Thirty-Six Gangs") had organized a Qingdiao Sympathy Confraternity to collect money under false pretenses. Yesterday, he sent a letter to the Municipal Party Department requesting a thorough investigation to verify the facts for review. The original letter stated, "According to a report from the Guanqi Association, a thorough investigation reveals that Xiao Xigua A'e, Lai Li A'lan, Yang Heshang, A Gou, and others are all ruffians who have infiltrated the Shanghai community and concealed themselves among the laborers, passing their time. Only A Gou is hiding in the Shuxie Xingtang store in Xicang, within the city. The others, such as Xiao Xigua, drift around without a fixed place. Whenever there are weddings or funerals in residential houses or hotels, they go to solicit business. Their service level is mainly based on delivering invitations and serving as ushers. These titles are a kind of ancillary service in the Guanqi industry and seem indispensable to the families involved. Due to the uncertainty of their nature, their use depends on the scope of the families involved. Now, with the prevalence of the New Life Movement, group weddings, and the reduction of funerals, they have entered a state of elimination. They know they will have difficulty gaining a foothold, so they have a bizarre idea, cleverly establishing a name, using the name of the Sympathy to deceive the Party Department and request registration. The Party Department authorities, not aware of the details, were deceived by the trick of hiding the truth and approved the registration, mixing fish eyes with pearls and unable to distinguish between right and wrong. After the Party Department approved it, they launched a major campaign, distributing leaflets and spreading rumors everywhere, forcibly dragging people into the association. The goal of their membership is ostensibly 600 people, with each member paying a membership fee of 3 yuan and an initial registration fee of 4 yuan for six months of donations. Based on this calculation, the ruffians can obtain four to five thousand gold in the blink of an eye. In fact, the members are all local ruffians (commonly known as the "Thirty-Six Gangs"). In the future, society will suffer from their harassment, which is unbearable. Therefore, we request a thorough investigation and an immediate dissolution. Society will be fortunate, and the industry will be fortunate, etc.," Attached is a copy of a leaflet. "Based on this, we are investigating whether the Qingdiao Sympathy Confraternity Preparatory Committee has been approved by your association. We are sending a copy of the association's declaration for your review and response."</p>

<h3>Xujiahui National Goods Exhibition - Soliciting Participation from Small and Medium-sized Factories - Registration Deadline: 17th of This Month</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Citizens' National Goods Promotion Association, located at Gaodun Street on the Nine Mu Site, resolved to start preparing for the Xujiahui National Goods Exhibition, its factory members have been eagerly registering. However, in previous National Goods Exhibitions organized by the association, the qualifications and types of participating factories were strictly regulated and restricted according to the rules. Now, with the entire national goods industry suffering from the impact of social economic recession and reduced consumer spending, a precarious situation has arisen. Especially for general small and medium-sized factories, it is most difficult. Yesterday, Cooperation Section Director Lin Guyun, Committee Members Chen Jusheng, Dong Boying, Xu Yunhui, and others gathered to discuss this. This time, based on the needs of the environment and the eager hopes of factories, some modifications were made to the participation rules. In addition to soliciting basic large factories, small and medium-sized factories are also welcome to participate, in order to widely promote their products, equalize and relieve production surpluses, implement financial adjustments, and maintain the livelihood of workers. However, due to limitations of economics and venue space, it is not possible to expand as much as desired. It has been decided that registration order will be the standard for participation, and the registration deadline will be 5:00 PM on the 17th of this month. No exceptions will be made. All small and medium-sized factories in Shanghai wishing to participate should not miss this opportunity.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Public Health Report - Infectious Disease Statistics</h3>
<p>Number of cases and deaths in the week ending midnight, July 13, 1935.</p>
<p>Spring Autumn</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Shou Juan)</p>
<p>It's too difficult to be a person in these times! You can't die, you can't live; you can't advance, you can't retreat; from the great nation down to the small individual, all are stuck in an unprecedented deadlock. If you want to lie low and not exert yourself, then living in the country is no different from a frog in a well, looking up and not knowing how high the sky is or how thick the earth is; moreover, since you are born with a pair of eyes, you can't help but see all sorts of things you can't stand to see; since you are born with two ears, you can't help but hear all sorts of news you can't stand to hear. How boring, how uncomfortable!</p>
<p>Aspiring people, dissatisfied with reality, travel far and wide to foreign countries to see what other people are like, so that they can come back and improve themselves. My friends Zhou Jianyun and his wife, and Ms. Hu Die, are holding such a purpose, set out on a grand European tour.</p>
<p>Now Zhou and Hu have returned. Today, people from all walks of life in Beijing and Shanghai held a welcome meeting at Yiyuan to express a bit of consolation. But all I want to ask them is about some romantic things: What is the snow scene on the Ural Mountains like? Is German steak delicious? What about the nude dances in Paris? How does Lake Geneva compare to West Lake? How beautiful are the Italian statues? Everything else, I dare not ask, knowing that if I ask, they will have a bellyful of complaints, so it's better not to ask.</p>
<h3>Leisurely July</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>My cousin wrote from home saying:</p>
<p>"...In June, it rained for more than half a month of yellow plum rain. There was only too much water in the rice fields. The water-drawing equipment was placed in front of the main room, enjoying the unexpected peace and quiet, quietly listening to the conversations of men and women in the village. There was also a bit of teasing from time to time. The old men squatted on the high threshold, smoking dry tobacco. The women sat on bamboo benches, spinning hemp. The young men scratched their heads and ears, wanting to sneak out to the streets to play cards. Leisurely July, ah!..."</p>
<p>July is also leisurely for me.</p>
<p>After the summer vacation starts, the days become long. I have collected a large number of short story collections from my friends' bookshelves. Sugar and Bai Jinlong cigarettes are always in stock. I wake up in bed at 5:00 AM. Summer is my season of abstinence. Yijuan has gone back to her own home to rest for the summer. While my mind is clear, I read a few pages of the lecture notes from last semester. I feel that the words on the lecture notes are more boring than those in the novels. July should let people live leisurely.</p>
<p>However, the rickshaw pullers are still working hard in the afternoon sun, brown arms, brown legs, "They are also living in July, why can't they get leisure?" Thinking and thinking, I fell asleep in the rattan chair. When I woke up, the sun was still high. On the way out of the house to the park, a Caulfield-type man was pushing a baby carriage, slowly walking into the alley. I thought he wouldn't be lonely. He has a Bemberg to relieve his boredom.</p>
<p>When I reached into my pocket to feel for a cigarette, a small hand suddenly came. I found a three or four-year-old beggar following me, mumbling in a voice that was neither too high nor too low, which made people tired of listening. I threw him a copper coin and exhaled a breath—"Leisurely July, ah."</p>
<h3>Overseas Rarities</h3>
<p>— Da Qian</p>
<p>There is a news item from Pasadena, California, USA, about Americans sending off overseas Chinese. The enthusiasm and sincerity are extraordinary. The newspaper gives a detailed account. However, the person being sent off is not what we Chinese would consider a party or state important person, but an old vegetable vendor who has been in the area for many years. This is also beyond our imagination, but is equally worth reporting in our Chinese newspapers. The vegetable vendor's name is Tan Sheng. He first came as a gardener at the age of about twenty, and worked in this industry for about twenty years. Then he switched to being a vegetable vendor. He is fair and honest, generous and righteous, and has been so for thirty-seven years. In recent years, affected by the economic decline in the United States, he still refuses to change his usual habits. He has the demeanor of Han Kang selling medicine in our country. Therefore, all the American women who trade with him admire him. Recently, it was discovered that he had no savings and would become a burden on the local government if he stayed any longer. Therefore, he resolutely and voluntarily wanted to return to China. The American women who used to trade with him, upon receiving this news, felt his fairness, honesty, generosity, and righteousness. They voluntarily gathered to send him off. Seventy-five people came, mostly elderly women. They set up a table under the shade of a tree next to the vegetable vendor's small wooden house, arranged a meal, gave flowers, and raised glasses to say goodbye. Many wept. They also collected $100 in US dollars to buy a Western bank check in China as a gift. This is all reported in the American newspapers, which shows that it is true. "Speak loyally and act respectfully." You will be successful wherever you go. Is this not a clear and great proof?</p>
<h3>Melon-Eating Dreams</h3>
<p>— Tong Fu</p>
<h3>Flies and Cholera</h3>
<p>— Wu Ji</p>
<p>Flies are the usual intermediaries for spreading cholera, breeding in feces and garbage. If human feces from a person with cholera are mixed in, the flies that land on it will be infected. The flies themselves do not get sick as a result. They simply carry some germs on their legs and fly away, then land on uncovered food and leave some germs on it. People who eat this food swallow the cholera germs into their stomachs, where they enter the intestines, multiply, and invade the intestinal walls, thus causing the symptoms of cholera!</p>
<p>Cholera is most likely to occur in the summer. If you don't prevent it early, it's very dangerous once it's discovered! Since we know that flies are the medium for spreading cholera, and that damp places such as garbage dumps and latrines are the main camps for harboring germs, the best way to prevent it is to use medicines such as "Ya Lin Deodorant Water" from the Wuzhou Pharmacy to sprinkle in all parts of the house, so that the germs are eliminated, flies disappear, and epidemics have no way to occur.</p>
<p>Acknowledgement Zheng Yimei's "Yimei Xiaopin" has established a unique style in the literary world since its publication and has long been praised by readers. Yesterday, I was also given two huge volumes of his new work "Yimei Congtan," which is witty and even more refined. After reading it, I couldn't put it down. The book was published by Xiaojingyoufang. I would like to express my thanks here and introduce it on his behalf.</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 16 Tears Hidden Behind the Curtain, Difficult to Escape Cold Eyes Clothing and Hats Boasting of Good Fortune, Once Arrived at Powerful Doors</p>
<p>Zhiqian said: People in the world can't just live to eat and dress, there are more important things than eating and dressing there. But you, who only know how to ask people for tips, how would you understand. The tea boy laughed and said: What is there that I don't understand? It's often printed in the newspapers now, and the guests here also often say it, isn't it just the two words "love"? It's just that a girl who has fled here from the west like her is not worthy to talk about this. Zhiqian just smiled and nodded to him, and didn't talk to him about right and wrong anymore. After washing his face, he poured a cup of tea and drank it slowly. Unconsciously, he put down the teacup and went back to thinking deeply. Finally, he thought that he could only go out temporarily and talk to a friend to get rid of his worries. Therefore, he ordered the tea boy to lock the door, expressing his determination to go out, and then slowly walked towards the front courtyard. When he was about to reach Jia Duocai's door, he didn't know why, but his heart naturally started beating wildly. Therefore, his two feet couldn't listen to him, but just kept slowing down. At this time, the newspaper of the day had just been placed on the table. The travelers surrounded the table and were reading the newspaper under the awning. Zhiqian also squeezed into the crowd, grabbed a newspaper at random, and stood reading. When he looked at Jia Duocai's room with a stolen glance, the two glass windows that were previously wide open were now tightly closed. Although separated by glass, he could still see inside, but it was not very clear. It seemed that only a corner of the bed curtain was exposed, but he couldn't see anyone's shadow. However, the door curtain was hanging down, but the door was not closed, as if the people in the room had not gone out either. After reading the newspaper for a while, when he looked up again, he couldn't help but feel sad for a while. (267)</p>
<h3>Imperial Incense Floating Record</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>I don't know why these few well-intentioned pieces of advice of mine would shock her. But she was more than just shocked! She also fixed her two eyes firmly on me, revealing a very angry and hesitant look. At that time, I didn't feel scared at all, just surprised. Fortunately, after a while, she didn't express anything else, and retreated back to the throne, pretending to smile and said:</p>
<p>"Okay! According to what you said, let's sit down and play cards!"</p>
<p>Of course, this time the situation had been seen by the other female officials, and it had soon spread. Therefore, when I reported to the Empress Dowager and returned to our resting room to rest, a female official who had been in charge of affairs in the palace for several years solemnly called me over and asked me as solemnly as a judge interrogating a prisoner:</p>
<p>"Don't you know that you have committed a very serious crime?"</p>
<p>"I don't know! What crime did I commit?"</p>
<p>"The Empress Dowager felt suffocated and wanted to go to the long corridor for a walk, but you stopped her and made her still sit in the Flower Palace." The female official said here, really with a stern voice. "Isn't such deliberate disobedience to the Empress Dowager's edict a big crime? Don't be confused! You have to ask what kind of punishment you should receive for committing such a crime? Then you will know how powerful it is!"</p>
<p>After hearing her say this, I was indeed a little worried! I myself had just seen the Empress Dowager look at me fiercely. Although she had not yet explicitly pointed out my crime at this moment. (367)</p>

<h3>Introduction to Goldfish Care</h3>
<p>— Ji Yun</p>
<p>In a small study, a glass tank of goldfish is placed, and I fear no one would dislike it. The bright fish scales, reflected in the shimmering waves amidst the purple algae, are full of poetic and artistic charm. However, delicate goldfish are difficult to care for. One careless move can easily lead to their death. Here, I introduce the Japanese method of raising goldfish.</p>
<p>The Japanese are very fond of raising goldfish. Shop windows often display a tank of goldfish as a decoration. This is especially common in barber shops, where customers can watch the lively goldfish performing various swimming arts in the tank while sitting in the chair, feeling dull and bored. There is a Goldfish Association in Tokyo, and all members are goldfish enthusiasts. The method introduced by the author was presented by Mr. Yamahata at a meeting of the association. The association has been established for fifty years and has considerable experience, which is beyond ordinary people's reach.</p>
<p>There are specialized goldfish shops in Japan, and large companies such as Shirokiya also sell goldfish on their rooftops. There are also street stalls and night markets, and vendors shout to sell them from small carts. These are only for ordinary appreciation, mostly selling beautiful glass tanks, so there are no precious varieties. Goldfish come in dozens or hundreds of forms and colors, making them difficult to distinguish, and their names are arbitrarily chosen. The common selection criteria are a round and proper head (a pointed head is extremely ugly), a balanced body, and symmetrical sides. The colors of vermilion, gold, and scarlet are considered authentic.</p>
<p>In the past, goldfish were covered with oilcloth during heavy rain. Now, a wooden frame embedded with celluloid is used, tilted over the top. When the weather is clear, they can receive sunlight, and when it rains, they can avoid raindrops. Goldfish must see six hours of sunlight every day, otherwise, their colors will not be bright. Too small a container or too many goldfish will result in insufficient oxygen, which can easily lead to death. To keep goldfish alive in a small container, the only way is to feed them less. Give them threadworms and mosquito larvae twice a week, about the size of a small plum each time is enough.</p>
<p>Goldfish should be allowed to exercise slightly every day. When changing the water, pay attention to the temperature difference, which should not be too large. Leave about one-third of the old water, then add two-thirds of new water, and they will quickly begin to move around. They are sluggish at night, so it is best to move them to a larger container to absorb more oxygen and restore their energy. In hot weather, create a small fountain on the surface of the water, and the splashing water droplets will make the goldfish swim happily. Conversely, in cold autumn and winter, leave two-thirds of the old water and add one-third of new water when changing the water. If you want to change all the water, be sure to expose the water to sunlight until it reaches a suitable temperature. Seal the tank at night and change the water the next day. Cold is the most dangerous thing for goldfish, and attention should be paid to it.</p>
<p>Finding food for goldfish is also difficult. In the past, mosquito larvae and threadworms could be found in Tokyo's small rivers. Now, artificial fish food is mostly used. According to the Goldfish Association, loach (mudfish) is the most suitable. First, tear it into three or four pieces with your fingers, and the goldfish will cleverly eat the meat and leave the bones behind. Some people also mix dried bonito flakes (a Japanese specialty) with wheat bran as goldfish food.</p>
<p>Goldfish are prone to indigestion due to insufficient abdominal exercise, which can lead to stomach problems. Algae also absorb oxygen, so it should not be overdone, two or three branches are enough, but it cannot be completely absent. Goldfish have many diseases. For example, in "white spot disease," the goldfish's entire body is covered with white spots. This is because of a sudden cold after being in warm conditions. The treatment is to hold the goldfish halfway in your hand and use a brush to drip cold well water onto it one drop at a time. Also, if the water level in the container is too shallow and the fish are exposed to too much sunlight, the goldfish will swim tilted. Half of the cloudy water must be replaced. Too much food can cause respiratory diseases. When the two gills are wide open, the disease has entered the second stage. Even a single gill being expanded indicates illness. Both gills must flash at the same time to indicate a healthy state. If respiratory problems are discovered, stop feeding the fish. Place them in a large container and constantly sprinkle fresh water on them to restore their health. All of these diseases are easily contagious and must be isolated.</p>
<p>The treatment for constipation is still under research. After bowel movements, we humans should eat more green vegetables and fruits. The same goes for fish, so green moss is indispensable. Placing small stones on the bottom of the glass container makes it easy for moss to grow, which can keep the goldfish healthy. Ordinary glass tanks without green moss are not ideal.</p>
<h3>A Couple in Hardship</h3>
<p>— (Jun Mou)</p>
<p>There was a man named Shen who lost both parents at the age of fourteen. Being orphaned and poor, he made a living as a factory worker with meager earnings, but he was quite thrifty. After years of hard work, he quit his factory job and started a small business. It went quite smoothly, and with diligence and frugality, he had a surplus each year, and his private savings were nearly ten thousand yuan. Just then, the January 28th Incident occurred, the commercial market declined, and various public bonds plummeted. Shen used his savings from years of hard work, as there was no suitable place to store them, so he might as well buy all public bonds. It was a desperate gamble. Unexpectedly, not long after the January 28th Incident, public bonds surged again, and Shen made a considerable profit, becoming a wealthy man. When he was living the life of a factory worker, there was a woman from the same village who also worked in the same factory. Seeing that Shen was diligent, frugal, and hardworking, she knew he was orphaned and helpless, just like herself, and felt pity for him. Shen's clothes were often torn and his shoes worn, and the woman would always mend them for him. When Shen was in economic straits, his food and clothing were sometimes insufficient, and the woman would always help him find solutions. The woman had been working in the factory for many years, and her hard-earned savings were considerable. Shen felt that he was penniless and did not dare to have any wild hopes. He was deeply grateful for the woman's help. Shen was nearly thirty years old and had considerable assets, and marriage was important to him. He remembered the kindness of the woman from his village and inquired about her. He learned that the woman had suffered great losses due to the January 28th Incident, and because the factory was destroyed, she had a difficult time in Shanghai and had to return to her hometown. Having suffered this great shock, she was full of despair and had the intention of becoming a nun. Shen immediately invited friends to return to his hometown, and after inquiring, learned that the woman had been vegetarian for more than a year, but had not yet carried out her plan to become a nun. He immediately asked a friend to persuade her. The woman refused because Shen had become a rich man, while she had unfortunately suffered such setbacks, and their circumstances were too different. After Shen's repeated and sincere requests, the woman finally agreed to marry him, and the marriage was arranged. Because they became husband and wife through hardship, the depth of their feelings was naturally different from ordinary people. One day, Shen was invited to a banquet by a friend, drank heavily, and lost control. He stumbled into a brothel and contracted gonorrhea. He sought medical treatment everywhere, but it was difficult to cure completely. Soon, he infected his wife, who also suffered from leukorrhea. Fortunately, through a friend's introduction, he purchased "Gonado Deng," a holy medicine for treating gonorrhea, sold by Tongren Western Medicine Shop at No. 1 Dexing Lane, West Xinqiao Street, French Concession, Shanghai, for two yuan per box. Shen was cured after taking only a few boxes. His wife also purchased internal white discharge pills and external white discharge medicine from Sun Weicai Father and Son Hospital at No. 64 Ningbo Road, French Concession, Shanghai, for two yuan each. She took them internally and used them externally as instructed. She was also safely cured within a short period. The following year, she gave birth to a son. From then on, Shen deeply understood the mistakes he had made after drinking and vowed never to repeat them. He enjoyed his healthy life and lived out his natural lifespan. Shen, as an orphaned and penniless factory worker, was fortunate to have the help of a woman from his village in times of hardship, so he would not be left without hope. This was his heaven-born blessing. After he prospered, he did not forget the past and persistently sought to marry the lonely woman who had helped him and suffered setbacks. This was his innate sincerity. His mistake after drinking almost led to the extinction of his offspring, but he recovered his health. This was also a trick of fate, reminding him to be wary of indulging in sensual desires when well-fed and warm. However, the effectiveness of the medicine in curing the couple's chronic illnesses cannot be forgotten.</p>

<h3>Opening Ceremony of the National Sports Association's Training and Discussion Meeting in Qingdao</h3>
<p>(Qingdao, October 15th, Electric Dispatch) The National Sports Association's training and discussion meeting was held at 9:00 AM this morning with an opening ceremony. Over 300 people attended, including representatives and all the officials and athletes. Chairman Wang Zhengting gave an opening speech, briefly stating that the significance of holding the joint meeting is simple and profound. He encouraged the students and athletes to have a spirit of continuous effort and proper guidance. Now that the sports community from all over the country is gathered in one place, he specifically expressed his welcome on behalf of the national sports community. Representatives from the Ministry of Education, such as Lei Fazhang, then gave speeches in succession, which were very important. The ceremony concluded at 12:00 PM, and a group photo was taken.</p>
<h3>Peng Yongxin Reports on the Eve of the Summer Training Camp Opening</h3>
<p>Heroes from the Five Sacred Mountains Gather in Qingdao. Leng Peigen and Dai Shuguo have made significant progress.</p>
<p>(Excerpt) The scenery in Qingdao is excellent, and the climate is cool. No wonder wealthy people come here to escape the summer heat. The seawater is especially fun to play in, but unfortunately, those of us who compete on land cannot often do water sports.</p>
<p>Those who have already arrived in Qingdao include Liu Changchun, Leng Peigen, Yang Daogui, and Liu Mingru from Nanjing; Dong Shuzhao, Hao Chunde, Wang Jihai, Wang Zhenglin, Wang He, Sun Huipai, Chen Xingpei, Chen Jiayou, and Jia Lianren from Shanghai; Dai Shuguo from Fujian; Tan Fuzhen and Zhou Changxing from the Northeast; and Zhang Lingjia, Wang Shilin, and myself from Beiping. It is said that Chen Baoqiu, Lin Shaozhou, and Liu Yingjun will arrive later. Fu Baolu is currently in Yantai filming a movie for Tianyi Film Company and will also be able to come to Qingdao soon. I don't know why Li Shiming from the Northeast has not yet arrived in Qingdao. Tomorrow, training will officially begin. We saw Liu Changchun last year at the North China Games. He had a protruding belly and looked quite prosperous. Now his belly is gone, and the muscles in his abdomen are visible. It can be seen that he has put in a lot of effort. Leng Peigen has returned to his old form, and his discus throws are approaching 40 meters. Dai Shuguo's 400-meter time can break 51 seconds. Hao Chunde's javelin, it is said, often reaches 50 meters in practice. Dong Shuzhao's 400-meter time is 52.4 seconds, and he claims he hasn't used his full strength because he still has the 800-meter and 1500-meter races later. Zhang Jiakui has not yet arrived because the issue of whether he will represent Jiangsu or Shanghai at the National Games has not been resolved. I think he will definitely be able to come soon. It is a pity that Bai Chunyu cannot come to Qingdao for training. It is truly a regret. On the basketball side, Tang Baokun and Li Zhenzhong from Nanjing, and Wang Yuzeng and Liu Yunjhang from Beiping have arrived. Mou Zuoyun and Wang Hongbin and Shen Yugong from Tianjin have not yet arrived.</p>
<p>Most of the people attending the sports lecture have also arrived in Qingdao and will start school tomorrow. The following is our daily routine:</p>

<h3>The Grandeur of the Gaohashi Sea Bathing Event</h3>
<p>Guangdong Team Members Perform a Sea Crossing; Mayor Wu Participates, Reaching a Peak of Popularity</p>
<p>The sea bathing event co-organized by the Municipal Seaside Bathing Place and the Guangdong Swimming Team was held at the Gaohashi Seaside Bathing Place on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. Invitations were sent to various people to visit, and special ferries were provided for transportation, making it a grand event. Mayor Wu Tiecheng also participated in person. The situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>A Moment of Great Splendor</p>
<p>The special ferry departed at 1:05 PM, arriving at Gaohashi Town around 2:00 PM. Passengers boarded eight buses and reached the seaside at 2:30 PM, entering the tents prepared for the Guangdong team to rest. Due to the large number of people, latecomers could not find space. Later, the mountain office arranged several rows of cloth chairs in front of the staff dormitory of the venue, causing delays in the schedule. The planned one-mile sea crossing swim, originally scheduled for 3:00 PM, was postponed to 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>Sea Crossing Performance</p>
<p>The Guangdong team members Wu Gansheng, Huang Rixiong, Huang Yuanli, Wu Shao, Guo Ruiji, Huo Zhenghong, Zhou Huiqing, Chen Baoyi, Zhu Jiongpei, Su Naichun, and Guan Songling, a total of twelve people, were transported by small sampans to the deep water area around 4:00 PM. Yellow and green buoys marked the ends of the distance. At 4:15 PM, a cannon was fired, and the twelve swimmers entered the water together, with Huang Rixiong leading in front, about ten yards ahead of the second swimmer, Wu Gansheng. However, due to the rapid currents, they were forced to swim diagonally, wasting a considerable amount of distance. Wu Gansheng was very valiant. When the cannon sounded again, signaling the end, Wu actually overtook Huang Rixiong by about five or six yards. Checking the time, it was only eleven minutes and ten seconds. However, due to the favorable current and the subsequent discovery that the buoys had been moved by the current, the distance was less than one mile, so the results were declared unofficial.</p>
<p>Awarding Prizes</p>
<p>Most commendably, all twelve swimmers reached the finish line one after another within one minute, which was truly remarkable. The seaside authorities took photos of the top two finishers at the finish line and then took a group photo after they came ashore. They then invited the guests for refreshments and specially invited Ms. Wu Dong, a reporter from the Central News Agency, to present the awards. Wu Gansheng, the first-place winner, received a large silver cup awarded by Chen Yaorong. The other eleven heroes each received a silver medal as a memento. In addition, the One Wheel brand swimsuits, previously donated by the Lianhua Woolen Mill, were also awarded yesterday to Huo Zhenghong and two others. The Guangdong team leader, Leader Li, reported on the history of the team, and Mr. Mai of the Mountain Seaside Bathing Place delivered a speech. Checking the time, it was already past 7:00 PM, and everyone happily boarded the ferries back to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Postal Workers' Table Tennis Team Returns Triumphantly from Northern Expedition</h3>
<p>Eight Wins in Eight Matches in Tianjin and Beijing</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union table tennis team, led by the union's sports director Xu Duo and a group of ten people, set off for Tianjin and Beijing on the 30th of last month.

He hopes for the infinite future of Zhejiang. From now on, we should abide by the principle that everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the world. In today's difficult times and rural bankruptcy, we should continue to work together. The enthusiastic attendance of members today, and their energetic spirit despite the heat of over 90 degrees, is truly exciting. However, what is regrettable is that the chairman of the society, Xu Shuji, has passed away, causing us to lose our leader suddenly.

Finally, he touched on the solution to technical problems, but he could not elaborate due to time constraints.

<p>The gold market yesterday began trading for the August/September rollover period, and market conditions were thus unremarkable. Although the market opened slightly weak due to the Central Bank's initial sales order, the Hong Kong market tightened, Indian silver plunged sharply, and buying interest ultimately ignited, leading to a tight situation. In the morning, overseas silver markets uniformly plummeted. The forward price of Montel silver also fell by varying amounts from 1.15 fen to 1.4 fen. London's raw gold remained unchanged, and exchange rates rose slightly. When over-the-counter trading opened, it immediately rose to 52.3 yuan. Major players sold off at the high, retreating to 50 yuan, but there was a significant surge of buyers taking advantage of the low price to replenish their positions. Soon, it was reported to be pulling up again. After the opening, the Central Bank's listed exchange rates were announced, with both British and American rates remaining unchanged.

However, the HSBC's listed exchange rates also remained unchanged, and the bank continued to sell US dollars. At this point, there were frequent ups and downs. Subsequently, the Hong Kong market reported tight conditions, stimulating buying interest, which led to a rebound.

Major players suddenly came in to sell off, and there was a temporary lack of support, leading to another weakening. Ultimately, due to the continued tightness of the Hong Kong market, people's hearts remained stable, and buyers acted in concert, gradually improving the situation. At noon, the Hong Kong market rebounded by 0.0625, and the overall trend remained stable. The after-market was predicted to see a reduction of 13 annas in Indian silver, and the Hong Kong market tightened again by 0.1875, causing the over-the-counter market to immediately rise to 52.3 yuan.

Hot weather influenced enthusiasm and caused flurries, resulting in high competitiveness. Major participants entered and exited frequently, but trading hats were reduced somewhat.

Investors continued to buy 96 Public bonds, and the price rose continuously, but a certain seller suddenly took a wait-and-see attitude, causing conditions to vacillate.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton   Staple Yarn Long Drop Causes Thought of Growth</h3>
<p>After a long drop in prices in the yarn market, there are obvious signs of a rebound and recovery. Foreign traders are replenishing shorts in the near months, while still releasing in the distant months. At the same time, the sales of existing yarn seem to be developing more.

<p>Golden Rooster Rebounding and Improving  Staple yarn market opening, near-month prices were steady, because the sellers paid on the prior day, so volumes were still low. As far as long term, trends are adamant. From the second to third auctions, prices rose abruptly because of the rise in raw cotton, and most factories had closed and reduced production, to serious effects. Cotton yarn production reduced to around 50%, and thoughts of selling were dimmed. At the close, the market gained more steam. The result was that each month was increased by 0.8 jiao to 1.3, 1.4, 1.5 jiao. In the afternoon the auctions were stopped for two weeks because of hot weather.

<h3>The Flooding in Hubei Cotton Region; Hankou Merchants Bought New Cotton</h3>
<p>The cotton market is trending strong, with prices rising sharply. Spot prices have reached a new high of $853. The bullish position for July-August delivery is solid, and the intention to squeeze shorts is very strong. The cotton-producing area around Xiangfan in the Hubei region is experiencing increasingly severe flooding. The Hankou merchants' purchases are particularly strong, pushing the market even higher.</p>
<h3>Zheng Biao's Price Increase Strengthens; Spot Cotton Opens Firm, Distant Months Become Active</h3>
<p>At the opening of the cotton auction, near-month contracts were stable, but distant-month contracts were unexpectedly active. Although U.S. cotton fell by 10 points, spot prices broke through the $50 level. Severe flooding occurred in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, inundating a large number of cotton fields. Merchants from Hankou came to Shanghai to purchase new cotton, further tightening the market. Bullish positions in August for old cotton were rolled over, and prices rose sharply. As a result, prices for all months increased by 15 to 40 cents compared to the previous day's close.

<h3>A Review of Overseas Cotton Markets for the Week</h3>
<p>Bombay: Last week, due to bullish sentiment, futures were very strong. Although U.S. cotton fell slightly, it had no impact here. The strength of old cotton was partly due to the lack of spot cotton and partly due to the small amount of July delivery. The sharp rise in silver prices and the strong wheat market also contributed to the bullish market. Japanese merchants and a well-known operator were actively buying. Later, profit-taking and speculative selling led to a slight reaction. Current demand is not very satisfactory, and European inquiries are disappointing. Factories show little interest. The weather is generally favorable, and the cotton-growing areas have received widespread rain. The statistics for the past week are as follows (in thousands of bales):</p>
<p>1934  1935</p>
<p>Accumulated Receipts Since September 1  2,308  2,378</p>
<p>Weekend Inventory  996  679</p>
<p>Accumulated Exports Since September 1  1,333  1,509</p>
<p>Exports to Europe  356  374</p>
<p>Exports to China  148  79</p>
<p>Exports to Japan  810  1,026</p>
<p>Exports to Other Regions  39  30</p>
<p>Liverpool: Spot sales were very good last week. In the futures market, trade was greatly hindered by insufficient information from Washington and by government cotton field reports that were higher than expected. Favorable weather reports suppressed prices, but lower prices also discouraged deliveries. In the Egyptian cotton market, Sakel cotton has fallen slightly due to short covering and profit-taking. Upper Egypt cotton has been able to maintain its value.</p>
<p>U.S. Cotton: The latest statistical reports are as follows (in thousands):</p>
<p>June  1934  1933  1932</p>
<p>Raw Cotton Consumption  386  363  696  321</p>
<p>Linters Consumption  62  55  81  47</p>
<p>Total Exports  345  459  615  366</p>

<h3>Grains: Significant Decrease in Digestion, Du Yang Rice Reduced Price for Sale</h3>
<p>Local rice (Shanghai South) yesterday saw a sudden decrease in supplies from various merchant groups, with only about ten boats arriving (totaling about 2,000 shi). Inland merchants suffered significant losses due to this market decline and successively sent letters to stop sales. As a result, although transactions for Jiangsu and Tongcheng japonica rice were limited, the market sentiment was stable, with no major fluctuations. However, Nangang early rice, with substantial inventory, and the hot weather, led to weaker sentiment and a drop of 10 cents. Various late rice varieties continued to arrive from Qingdao, Yantai, etc., totaling about 500 packages, and prices also saw small decreases of 10 to 20 cents. Silver dollars weakened further, while silver ingots had no market. (Shanghai North) Supplies totaled 16 or 17 boats, and the market was slow. Local and rural consumers were quiet. White japonica rice continued to decline by 10 to 20 cents, early thin rice also declined by about 20 cents, silver dollars fell by 30 to 40 cents, and other varieties also declined by 10 to 20 cents.</p>
<p>Digestion of foreign rice decreased significantly, and prices fell by 6 to 7 cents to about 10 cents per unit. Because domestic merchants had sluggish sales, other merchant groups did not have smooth sales. In addition, rice merchants in Hexia were eager to sell their rice due to the hot weather. Transactions in foreign rice at this street were also sharply reduced. Although merchant groups along the Yangtze River had urgent needs for grain due to the flooding, the number of sales for each merchant group was small. The total market offered 6,000 packages from Saigon, plus 150 tons. The amount of all rice from Gao Gong fell slightly and totaled only 1,600 packages. The total was less than 10,000 packages, and the buyers included Najiang, Hankou, Nanjing, Tianjin, and Ningbo merchants from this street. Although the market was lively, it was only for small transactions.</p>
<h3>期粉因浮空抵補而堅 (Wheat Flour Futures Strengthen Due to Short Covering)</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed signs of an initial decline followed by stabilization. With quotes in foreign currency, Chicago fell by 456 points, and Canada fell by 12 points. Market sentiment was affected by the continued decline in foreign wheat and new spot transactions in the previous week, leading to weak sentiment in both near-term and long-term markets. The current month's contract initially fell below the $3 mark, reaching a recent low of $2.285. Distant month contracts were initially weak due to slight selling pressure from factories. Later, due to short covering by industry participants, trading became active, and prices gradually stabilized. Given the current environment, if foreign wheat sales do not continue, market values should remain stable, and future trends may stabilize temporarily. As a result, the current month was unchanged, January was up half a point, September-October were unchanged, and November-December were up 2.5 cents.</p>
<p>The Flour Exchange will only conduct morning auctions starting yesterday, with a total of six sessions. The time remains at 10:00 AM, and afternoon auctions will resume when the weather cools down.</p>
<h3>行家止拋，麥市跌勢暫定 (Traders Stop Selling, Wheat Market Decline Temporarily Stabilizes)</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market initially weakened after the morning opening due to continued declines in foreign wheat quotes and weak buying power from outside the industry. As a result, with less competition between buyers and sellers, it was difficult to see excessive price fluctuations. Traders stopped selling because they were unwilling to sell unless foreign wheat continued to decline. The market temporarily stabilized for this reason. During the afternoon session, the current month's contract was weak due to large inventories of spot wheat and factories mostly offering bids. Distant month contracts rose slightly due to the stabilization of the flour market and a decline in foreign exchange rates, leading to slightly higher sentiment. Looking ahead, prices should not decline excessively if foreign wheat sales stop. As a result, the current month fell by one cent, August rose by two cents, September rose by four cents, and October rose by five cents. The spot wheat market remained in a stalemate because factories did not purchase and the association did not post prices.

<h3>國產綿白新到千四百件，市勢略鬆 (1,400 New Shipments of Domestic Spun White Sugar Arrive, Market Slightly Loosens)</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market, although subject to increased customs duties, remained very quiet, with a stagnant trend. The association's quoted price for spot coarse white sugar was $15.95, and the price for re-exported goods was $4.80. Taikoo Sugar and the local factory's spun white sugar also saw little change. The domestic fine red sugar saw new arrivals of over 1,400 bags yesterday, so the market slightly softened. Only about 200 bags were offered, with the best quality priced at $11 and lower qualities at reduced prices. However, high-quality merchants were still asking $11.20 but have not yet made a transaction.</p>
<h3>南北貨 (Dried Goods and Northern &amp; Southern Specialties): 廣幫 (Guang Merchants) Rumors That Raw Peanuts May Be Taxed</h3>
<p>Yesterday, rumors circulated among Guangdong merchants that raw peanuts would be subject to a 20% tax increase, so the market slightly strengthened. About 200 tons were offered, including jujube kernels at $6.05, Tizhuang Dangshan kernels at $5.45, and Xuzhou kernels at $5.20, all purchased by Guangdong merchants. If the tax increase is not just a rumor, the market should tighten further.</p>

<h3>評書與評人 (Book Reviewing and Person Reviewing)</h3>
<p>— 另境 (Another Realm)</p>
<p>Treating others with sincerity doesn't necessarily guarantee reciprocal sincerity in return these days. However, the old saying "treat others with sincerity" hasn't entirely lost its meaning; it's still fundamentally true. Book reviewing is similar to treating people. There are many incomprehensible things in the world, and the inability to understand one's own personality is one of them. Someone with an eccentric or foolish personality might briefly become aware when others advise them that their behavior is unsuitable for modern society. However, within a minute, they'll still believe their way of handling things is most logical. The saying "every potter praises his own pot," is undeniably true, stemming from each person's sense of self-respect. Critiquing someone's hard-earned work with the prevailing attitudes of snobbery, prejudice, bias, deceit, or contempt will not gain the sincere and willing acceptance of the one being critiqued. Therefore, the most important attribute of a book reviewer is respect and sincerity towards the work. Of course, some people never accept criticism, and sometimes, treating others with sincerity leads to deceit and snobbery. However, the responsibility for this no longer lies with the reviewer. I heard that a famous writer, upon receiving a book criticizing him, coldly said, "This kind of person..." and immediately threw the book in the trash. This writer's attitude is similar to that of critics who review people instead of their books, as if they were cast from the same mold.</p>
<p>Someone once said, "The moment a reviewer reveals they know more about the author than the book can tell them, their criticism immediately becomes an attack, and their ridicule becomes an insult." I think this is a very accurate statement and can be used as a reference for Chinese critics.</p>
<p>When a writer writes an article or a book, their responsibility lies only with the article or the book itself. Regardless of the author's personal life, whether they are a reckless gambler or despicable, critics should only look for "toxicity" or "benefit" within the book. The author's behavior is beyond the critic's concern; social morals and national laws will naturally handle that.</p>
<p>However, Chinese history is full of stories of judging literature based on the person or condemning the person based on their writing. These are all caused by "snobbish eyes"!</p>
<h3>惱 (Annoyance)</h3>
<p>— 湯美 (Tommy)</p>
<p>The clock was supposed to strike five, but it only chimed twice when Kong Shan, like a cricket, jumped out of his warm bed.</p>
<p>Kong Shan's ability to wake up at 5:00 AM is a recent development from the past week. A week ago, he wouldn't wake up until 10:00 AM. If you tried to pull his ear before then, he would grunt like a pig and turn over to sleep again. But in the past week, he has been waking up before 5:00 AM every morning, and he hurries to get up as soon as the clock chimes twice on its way to five.</p>
<p>The first thing he does after getting up is not brushing his teeth or washing his face, nor is it folding his bedding. Instead, he writes a love letter to his little darling, Chiyo-ko. He has been writing love letters to Chiyo-ko for a week. A bottle of expensive mint-green stationery, costing 50 cents, is almost used up. However, he still hasn't written a single love letter to Chiyo-ko. He resents that he arrived in Japan too late – he has only been in Japan for three months. He also resents his lack of diligence in these three months, which has led to his current inability to write a Japanese love letter.</p>
<p>The reason he has been waking up so early for the past week is that he believes he can have a clear head in the morning to do what, in his opinion, should be easy – write a love letter to his little darling, Chiyo-ko. However, in the morning, no matter how clear his head is, the only things that appear on the mint-green stationery, besides the greeting "Haikin" (拝啓), is "but" written in Japanese characters that even most Japanese people don't recognize.</p>
<p>In Chinese love letters, the first line should say something like "My darling!" or "My little angel!" However, Japanese greetings in letters are placed at the end of the letter. The first line should say "Haikin," which he learned from a Japanese textbook.</p>
<p>Today, after getting up, Kong Shan unthinkingly wrote "Haikin" on the flattened mint-green stationery with the broad nib of his Parker No. 2 pen. The peace and familiarity with which he wrote these two characters were similar to the expression he had when writing "Respected Father, Yours respectfully, [Father's Name]" in letters to his father because he has been writing "Haikin" for a week.</p>
<p>"Haikin..."</p>
<p>"What should I write?" Kong Shan touched the tip of his pen to his temple near his glasses and circled it in the air above "Haikin." He was just as clueless as he had been on previous mornings. The peace and familiarity he felt just now disappeared with the last stroke of the character "kin."</p>
<p>It's not that Kong Shan doesn't have anything to write. He has plenty to say that he wants to come alive on that mint-green stationery! If he were writing in Chinese characters, he could effortlessly create a 108,000-word-long letter, as hot as fire and as sweet as honey. However, unfortunately, he has to write in Japanese, which makes his head ache.</p>
<p>He keeps touching the tip of his pen to his temple, and unconsciously draws circles in the air above the characters "Haikin." In this state, "But" secretly appeared on the second mint-green stationery, just like a caterpillar. He knew he had written it unconsciously while spacing out, just like when he was talking to Chiyo-ko and a long string of "buts," like an old woman's prayer beads, hung from the corner of his mouth. His so-called love talks with Chiyo-ko were nothing more than gestures like a mute, drawing on the ground with tiles, and a mouth full of "buts." It's possible that the constant "but" hanging on his mouth might have piqued the other person's interest. But (let's borrow one from Mr. Kong here), he is writing a letter, not speaking. He knows that you can't just add a few "buts" to the letter, otherwise, it will give the reader a headache and they won't be able to finish reading it. Therefore, although he regrets that the expensive mint-green stationery, costing 50 cents, is almost used up and he still hasn't finished a letter, he has to tear up the stationery that already has "But" written on it. Alas! How annoying "But" is!</p>
<p>After tearing up the first sheet of stationery, he wrote "Haikin" on the second sheet. In his eyes, the characters "Haikin" were as reliable as iron because in the Japanese textbook, the first line of a letter is always "Haikin."</p>
<p>"Haikin..."</p>
<p>"What should I write?" Again, he didn't know what to write. He either touched the tip of his pen to his temple, or circled the tip of his pen in the air above the characters "Haikin." "But" secretly crept onto the second sheet of stationery in that situation, like a caterpillar. There is no doubt that when he found "But" written below "Haikin," he tore the paper angrily and crumpled it into a ball and stuffed it into his mouth. The crumpled stationery became a small, slimy rice ball under the attack of Kong Shan's teeth, which were good at chewing chicken bones. It shot out from between his thick lips like a bullet and landed in the corner of the wall.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, "But" was not destroyed under the counterattack of his teeth, which were good at chewing chicken bones, because it appeared on the second sheet of stationery like a ghost.</p>
<p>"Alas! Damn ghost!" He happily took a long breath that he had never taken before, and listlessly tore up the third sheet of stationery. He tore it into countless small pieces, like dismembering a body into five parts, and then placed them on his palm and blew, blew, blew with his thick lips. The pieces of paper fluttered like snowflakes in the small tatami room. This was Kong Shan's extreme punishment for "But": dismemberment followed by grinding the bones to ashes.</p>
<p>In the past week, he had almost torn up a Japanese textbook (at this time, he only had the ability to flip through this book). He knew how to write "cute," and he knew that the character "Lin" (淋) in "gonorrhea" meant "lonely." However, no matter what, these two sentences could not be connected to "Haikin," while "But," like a leech, clung tightly to "Haikin's" leg and refused to let go. This made Kong Shan tear up the mint-green stationery and had no other way to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>The stationery that cost 50 cents was used up. When he wanted to write "Haikin" on the next piece of paper, all that appeared before his eyes was a sheet of black, rough, and ugly horse manure paper. So, he threw his Parker No. 2 pen, which he usually valued more than his own life, against the wall, and lay down holding his head, which was throbbing with pain from thinking too much.</p>
<p>The clock in the landlord's house struck eleven. Kong Shan raised his head and glanced at the Parker No. 2 pen lying in a pool of blue-black blood, then lay down again, holding his head.</p>
<h3>巴生港中 (Port Klang Middle and Lower)</h3>
<p>— 劉明 (Liu Ming)</p>
<p>—南國歸來記之一— (One of the Records of Returning from the South)</p>
<p>The old man turned his head towards the constantly shifting forest on the shore, but raised his hand and waved it behind him, scolding harshly:</p>
<p>"Get out! Don't fart in front of me!"</p>
<p>The middle-aged fat merchant showed a threatening expression as if he had been insulted, and said to everyone:</p>
<p>"...No wonder the government has to use torture... The red-haired man's rattan whip is famous, it's really scary when it's used... Actually, it's not their fault... If he refuses to tell the truth, what can you do? May I ask, is your family in the government..."</p>
<p>The elegant young man, who was admiring the scenery leaning against the railing, turned around and chimed in with a smile:</p>
<p>"Therefore, a gentleman values righteousness, while a petty person values punishment!"</p>
<p>He looked pleased and was proud that he had taken the opportunity to throw out a literary phrase.</p>
<p>The middle-aged fat merchant ignored the young man, simply raised his eyebrows, and continued to say his piece.</p>
<p>"...Maybe it's like this, the case here will land him in jail for a few months, and then he'll be sent back... What's the point of making a special telegram..."</p>
<p>The pockmarked young man pouted, making a proud face, and said to himself:</p>
<p>"That's even better, I'm worried about not having food when I go back to Tangshan."</p>
<p>Then he pulled the old man's shoulder with his hand.</p>
<p>"Old man, you're doing well! It's a pity I haven't even been to Kuala Lumpur yet."</p>
<p>The old man ignored him, only replying to his woman in Burmese:</p>
<p>"瑞德宫，地馬沒西補，" ("There isn't [that] here in Jin Tower.")</p>
<p>The pockmarked young man stared at the middle-aged fat merchant, revealing a sly look, and sighed.</p>
<p>"Alas, it looks like I won't be able to be a ready-made old master!"</p>
<p>The person next to him chimed in jokingly:</p>
<p>"That's easy, just cause a little more trouble here!"</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll just fight as an individual!"</p>
<p>The pockmarked young man was squatting, but as he spoke, he stood up, stretching his creaking arms. He glanced at the middle-aged fat merchant out of the corner of his eye, walked to the child playing by the side of the boat, and shouted loudly:</p>
<p>"I'm going to hit you, you hateful little fatty!"</p>
<p>At this time, the boat had already approached the shore. The wheels under the stern of the boat made a loud sound of splashing water. The Chinese houses on the shore were safely revealed, bathed in the bright morning sunlight.</p>
<p>The Malaysian morning breeze was blowing on the deck.</p>
<p>After a while, a train of the Federated Malay States drove onto the shore. A number of red-haired soldiers with their guns drawn and shining bayonets immediately blocked off the traffic on the dock.</p>
<p>The middle-aged fat merchant glanced at the pockmarked young man and then glared at everyone, saying:</p>
<p>"Well! Let's get out of here!"</p>
<p>The pockmarked young man tried his best not to look alarmed, deliberately stretching his neck, pretending to look closely at the freight car, and said disdainfully:</p>
<p>"Cannons? Where are the cannons? ...Why did they pull out cannons?"</p>
<p>The old man had a gloomy face and didn't show any signs of alarm. He just quietly instructed his Burmese woman and children to pack up their belongings.</p>
<p>The doors of several freight cars suddenly opened at the same time, and people poured out like a tide. Some were carrying bags, and some were carrying bedrolls. Their clothes were very dirty, and they looked very disheveled, like refugees fleeing from disaster. After the red-haired soldiers counted the number of people, they invited them all onto the boat, without exception.</p>
<p>The pockmarked young man knew what was going on and happily grabbed one of the people coming up and asked:</p>
<p>"Brother, what crime did you commit?"</p>
<p>"What crime? Damn it! I committed the crime of not having a job!"</p>
<p>The person answering spoke half-slippery and half-angry, and threw the bag he was carrying under his arm at his feet as if he was getting rid of something.</p>
<p>The old man didn't like to ask questions, but dejectedly lay down, his face showing a helpless expression.</p>
<p>I remembered the summer of 1930. It was also a tropical morning like this. I was sitting alone at the Kuala Lumpur train station, waiting for the express train to Singapore. I also encountered a number of unemployed workers being escorted back to their country. Their disheveled appearance, dirty clothes, and the Cantonese accent saying "Damn it" were exactly the same as what I see now, but there weren't as many people. (End)</p>
<h3>Rain</h3>
<p>— Qin Wen</p>
<p>"A sweet rain after a long drought," how delightful this is for farmers! But in society, there are also those who do not mind the long sunny days but fear the rain, namely the rickshaw pullers, those who rely on tourists for boat rides, and the peddlers. It's not that they don't want rain, it's just that when the ground is wet, there are fewer tourists, and it becomes difficult to attract customers, causing anxiety about their livelihoods.</p>
<p>Generally, young ladies, wives, young masters and sons also resent the rain because it's inconvenient for them to go outside for a cheerful outing. Some people also take a detached position to appreciate the rain, considering it poetic, but none of them have a personal connection. In reality, even farmers, after a long drought, while they like the rain, also suffer from it.</p>
<p>Because of the sudden heavy rain, followed by continuous downpours, the roads are washed out, making it impossible to travel by cart. I once stayed in a farmhouse in the countryside for a few days. There weren't many houses, but there were quite a few variations: some had mud walls and tiled roofs, some had thatched roofs, and some were completely made of grass. But they all leaked. The places where water dripped were not just two or three. Drip, drip, drip in the east, drip, drip, drip in the west. When the wind was strong, the rain would slant in, also entering through the holes in the windows and cracks in the walls. It was okay during the day, as one could move around to avoid it, but moving the bed at night was troublesome. The light from the vegetable oil lamp was too dim, and the mud floor was covered with puddles, splashing one's feet when walking. One had to move three or four times in the middle of the night. Truly, "misfortune never comes singly!"</p>
<p>But even if it were just like that, it would be fine. In front of the door was a pile of ashes, next to which were several manure vats lined up. When the sky was cloudy and stuffy, it was particularly smelly. This was originally the headquarters of the flies, and when it rained, they would all fly into the house. One day, because the owner and a few older people had gone fishing while the water was rising, I cooked a meal for them. The firewood was also wet from the rain, making it difficult to light. After finally cooking it, I lifted the lid of the pot just before eating and was startled, thinking someone had secretly added a large handful of black beans. Upon closer inspection, I realized that the starlike specks were all flies, cooked together with the rice.</p>
<p>According to their experience, when cooking in such a place, one shouldn't cover the pot too early. Only after the water in the pot was sizzling could the lid be put on, after first tapping around the edge of the lid to drive away the flies that had landed there.</p>
<p>Even after scooping out the bodies of the flies one by one, we still swallowed the rice from the pot in large mouthfuls, bowl after bowl, without leaving a single piece of scorched rice. Afraid of getting sick, I suggested throwing the rice away, but the owner strongly objected, saying that in such times, it was already rare to have rice in the pot and firewood under the stove, so who cared about the flies. This scene left a deep impression on me. Although I only stayed for four days, it seems to occupy a large place in my life history. Now, whenever it rains, I can't help but think of it. In fact, the farmers who live this kind of life are not just the one family I stayed with. And according to what the owner said, this was considered good. He had no reason to lie to me, so it must have been true!</p>
<h3>University Days (24)</h3>
<p>— Written by German author Storm, translated by Chen Yinzhi</p>
<p>— He continued in this way for quite some time, until I left him.</p>
<p>I never saw him again. A few days later, I went out again to study law at a foreign university. A year later, my mother, who had heard me mention that encounter, wrote to tell me that Mr. Polica, the grandson of an official in the court of Louis XVI, had also found a position under the Black Cross.</p>
<p>Three years later, I went to study at a university in my home country. According to the regulations, I had to study here for one year before the graduation exam. Fritz was not coming back until the following autumn. I lived with him in Heidelberg for the past semester. But my friend Christopher had already graduated. He was now working as a foreman in a furniture company. One afternoon, I met him in a park, sitting thoughtfully with a glass of beer in front of him, a cigar in his mouth, puffing out smoke. His dense brown hair and elegant clothes made it difficult for me to recognize him until I got close. When I silently placed my hand on his shoulder, he quickly turned his head and looked at me proudly. Although I was not wearing colored lenses, my appearance clearly belonged to the "Latin" type, which he had always disliked. But once he recognized me, a kind of surprised and joyful affection showed in his eyes. "Philip, is that you?" he said, grasping my hand with an almost girlish humility and shaking it vigorously. — I talked for a long time, about our hometown, about our parents, about those old friends. When I mentioned that unfortunate skating accident, I asked about the news of our common sweetheart.</p>
<p>Lena Li was still living with an old seamstress relative, and she sewed for some noble families in the area. But Christopher answered these questions reluctantly, unwilling to say much, and finally tried to quickly change the subject. His honest nature seemed still bewitched by the beautiful girl. As for me, I thought I had long shaken off her magic, along with the dust of my hometown.</p>
<p>My view was not accurate. — Not long after, I accompanied several friendly noblewomen to the side of the bay where the university town was located, which was then a place of entertainment for the public. The afternoon was already over, and we walked down from the embankment to catch the ferry back to town. Two ferries were almost full and ready to depart. Next to one of the ferries, about thirty steps away from us, stood an old, lame seamstress, whom I had seen in the landlord's house. Beside her stood a very beautiful girl.</p>

<p>Telegraph Special Issue</p>
<p>The Voice of the Telegraph Industry</p>
<h3>Floods and Telegraphs</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Recently, in the provinces of the Yangtze River basin, there have been prolonged torrential rains, causing flash floods, resulting in water levels at various ports along the river exceeding the records for the same day in the past twenty years. The government and the people are all paying attention to the issue of flood prevention. Telegraphs are flying back and forth, appealing and crying out, making it the most serious problem at present. If we cannot properly prevent and eliminate the hidden dangers, once the embankments collapse, sweeping away thousands of miles, then the people's livelihood, social survival, and national life will be lost in the huge waves of the flood. It is reported that the Executive Yuan has ordered the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Railways to provide full facilities for flood prevention and relief in terms of communication and transportation, which is as it should be.</p>
<p>The matter of transportation is not within the scope of this article, so I will not discuss it further. Regarding communications, as far as we know, the Ministry of Communications seems to have done its best and is working to provide various facilities to disaster relief or flood prevention organizations. Because the water flows very quickly and the water势 is very fierce, it is important to be quick in prevention and rescue. Often, the speed of a telegraph transmission is related to countless lives and countless properties. In other words, even with thousands of people and huge financial resources, without the communication network, it is impossible to achieve the effect of flood prevention and disaster relief.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications once stipulated that for relief telegrams, any Chinese and foreign relief organizations that have been approved and registered by the National Government or the provincial governments may send relief telegrams for handling temporary or particularly urgent relief matters. These telegrams are transmitted free of charge. The manpower and materials spent by the Ministry of Communications each year amount to a considerable sum. According to statistics for the twenty-first year of the Republic, there were more than 1.8 million characters of relief telegrams, costing more than 180,000 yuan in telegram fees, all free of charge. That is, the Ministry of Communications has to subsidize more than 180,000 yuan in relief telegram fees each year.</p>
<p>In addition, there is also a type of flood prevention telegram. Flood prevention agencies can use the imprinted paper of their highest authority to send telegrams, either reporting on flood prevention work or reporting on water level heights, also free of charge. The Ministry of Communications has now issued a general order to all bureaus along the river, regardless of day or night, to send telegrams as soon as they arrive, and to deliver them as soon as they are received, with the same priority as telegrams concerning the safety of life.</p>
<p>Telecommunications is a state-owned enterprise, and it is its unshirkable responsibility to transmit news of flood prevention and disaster relief in advance. However, with so many urgent telegrams of this kind, other telegrams have to be delayed for transmission. It's like putting out a fire, the traffic at the scene of the fire has to stop for a while to let the fire trucks speed by. Also, many telegraph poles and lines in various places have been washed away by the flood, making it impossible to report. Repairs cannot be made until the water recedes to a considerable extent, just like railways and highways that have been cut off or submerged by water cannot be used until the water recedes. Therefore, in recent times, telegrams in various places have occasionally arrived late, which is not the fault of the telegraph bureau's poor performance. However, major commercial ports all have wireless equipment. Even if wired circuits are completely blocked, wireless can be used for reporting. But because the telegram service is very busy at the moment and the machine capacity is limited, overcrowding is inevitable. This is the impact of the flood on the telegraph service, a special situation that should be excused by the public.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the advance transmission of flood telegrams by various telegraph bureaus is, in a public sense, to relieve the public, and in a private sense, to relieve themselves. If the flood prevention agency can defend early because the telegram is transmitted quickly, then the city and the countryside will not suffer losses from the flood, the social and economic capacity can be maintained, and the revenue of the telecommunications administration will naturally be considerable. This is one reason. If the flood prevention agency gets the news from telecommunications and can rush to rescue in time, then the telegraph poles will not be washed away, the telegraph bureau will not be submerged, and the telegram service can be smooth. This is another reason. Based on this, if people across the country can recognize their responsibilities from their own standpoint for flood prevention and disaster relief, then human determination will overcome nature, and disaster will not be harmful.</p>
<h3>Future Telephone Business</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>In recent years, the policy of the Ministry of Communications for improving the telecommunications business has been entirely premised on the public interest. Almost all facilities that are beneficial to the public have been vigorously promoted, in order to make them universally available to the public. In terms of telegraphs, such as revising the charging method for the recipient's name and address, free inquiry of telegrams, sending and receiving telegrams by telephone, etc., this journal has introduced them in detail, so that readers know how to use them. In terms of telephones, the Ministry of Communications recently announced various regulations in the General Rules for Urban Telephone Business that facilitate public services, and local telephone bureaus will implement them separately in accordance with these rules. The future telephone business will have a period of marked development, it can be asserted. The reporter does not hesitate to waste words, and will briefly describe the various businesses stipulated in the General Rules for Urban Telephone Business below, hoping that readers will pay attention to them.</p>
<p>In order to promote the smooth sale of goods, it is necessary to have the conditions of extensive advertising. Although there are many reasons why urban telephones are not developed in our country, the price of telephone rental fees is not suitable for the general national economy, which is one of the important reasons. Therefore, in addition to the few merchants who must install them, it is still difficult to expect universal use. And on the part of the telephone bureau, with the huge amount of various expenses, the originally set rental fees are also difficult to reduce. In view of this, in addition to setting up public telephones in various telegraph offices or postal branches to facilitate all walks of life, the Ministry of Communications has also stipulated in the General Rules for Urban Telephone Business to handle joint telephone services to facilitate communication. The establishment of this business is entirely designed to save telephone charges for residential users. That is, two or more users can jointly apply to use the same telephone, and their names are listed separately in the telephone directory. The rental fee for each household is calculated according to the discount of the ordinary telephone fee. For example, 60% for two households, 50% for three households, and 40% for four households. According to the rental fee set by the Capital Telephone Bureau for residential telephones at eight yuan per month, one telephone used by four households would only cost three yuan and two cents per household per month, which can be said to be cheap.</p>
<p>It is said that the joint telephone business is mostly set up to facilitate households in the same house. As for general users in different houses who want to get a price reduction, there are also regulations for the same-line telephone in the General Rules of Business that can be used. The so-called same-line telephone means that two or more users in different houses install telephones on the same line. The rental fee for each household is also calculated according to the discount of the ordinary telephone rental fee. For example, 80% for two households, 70% for three households, and 60% for four households. Because the same-line telephone requires the supply of multiple telephones and special equipment must be installed at the telephone bureau to avoid calling confusion, the set rental fee is slightly higher than that of a joint telephone. It is said that the Shanghai Telephone Bureau will soon open this business to benefit users.</p>
<p>Check the user who installed the phone. Often answering the phone for neighbors is very annoying. If they are all rejected, it seems to be unforgivable. Especially when the owner is away on a trip or other accidents, there is no one to answer the phone, and it is easy to cause misunderstanding. In order to avoid this kind of trouble for users, the Business Rules also stipulate that when the user temporarily does not need to use the telephone, he can notify the telephone bureau to suspend the line or withdraw the machine, and retain the telephone number. When it is needed, the call will be restored. During the temporary withdrawal period, if someone calls the user, the telephone bureau will record his name and address and the date and time of the call, and notify the user when the call is restored. It can be said that the Ministry of Communications is very thoughtful for users.</p>
<p>In addition, if there are sports meets, exhibitions, or other events in various places that require temporary telephone installations, there are also regulations for temporary telephones. Only the installation fee and rental fee need to be paid, and no deposit is required. When ships are docked at the wharf and need to install telephones, there are also wharf telephone regulations that can be connected to the urban telephone for communication. All of these are facilities to facilitate the public. And what is especially worthy of our attention is the clear stipulation of the installation deadline. That is, after the telephone bureau receives the user's request, unless it is inconvenient due to construction, the road is not smooth, or there is a lack of empty numbers and empty lines, it can consider the situation and state the reasons in writing to delay or reject the installation separately. At the latest, a notice of acceptance must be issued within five days, and the machine must be installed within ten days after the fees are cleared, so that users do not have to wait for a long time, and general users who are willing to pay the rental fee for one or several seasons can also enjoy the benefit of price reduction to show preferential treatment. This is truly a very important improvement in the telephone business.</p>
<h3>Impressions of International Radio Station</h3>
<p>— Ding Haitao</p>
<p>Foreword: The reporter has long heard that the facilities of our International Radio Station are perfect and the management is novel. He is eager to visit and learn from it, but he has no chance to realize his long-cherished wish. In the late last month, he went to Shanghai on business, and spent a day on the various departments of the station. After on-the-spot investigation, Mr. Hu Mingxi, the business director of the station, and Mr. Wang Shixin, the receiving and dispatching director, received him diligently and provided detailed guidance and convenience. He was deeply grateful for the good impressions he received. Among the state-owned enterprises, there are not many that have been found, so he wrote this note to share with the readers of this journal.</p>
<p>The nature of the Central Receiving and Dispatching Room - The International Radio Station is the latest scientific equipment in modern times, so the communication equipment strives for perfection in order to make the work smooth. In order to avoid interference and increase the speed, in addition to installing various new machines, the remote control communication method is also adopted. The receiving and transmitting stations are located in Liu Xing, Zhen Ru, Fenglin Bridge and other three places outside Shanghai, and armor cables are used to connect them to the Central Receiving and Dispatching Room respectively for control. All matters concerning the receiving and dispatching of telegrams and the processing of business are handled centrally in the office. In other words, the Central Receiving and Dispatching Room is like the human brain, and the receiving and dispatching stations in various cities are like its ears and eyes. Every move is controlled by it, and they are connected and used flexibly. Those who say that the telegrams in the Central Receiving and Dispatching Room are first transmitted to the Zhen Ru or Fenglin Bridge transmitting station and then retransmitted are not true. This kind of speculation should not be taken by those who know, and the public should not misunderstand.</p>
<p>The Setting and Use of the Central Receiving and Dispatching Room - The Central Receiving and Dispatching Room of the International Radio Station is located on the second floor of the Sassoon Building on Renji Road. The location is convenient and the transportation is convenient. The room is rectangular in shape. A motor transport belt is installed in the center, and various new wave machines and high-speed automatic transmission machines, keyboard punching machines, typewriters, etc. are arranged on both sides, and the locations of direct reporting are marked for easy visibility. There is also a spacious walkway left so that there is no need to worry about shoulder-to-shoulder congestion. At the end of the room, there are machines for rectification and amplification and other applications, so that the signal current received by the Liu Xing receiving station can be stabilized after being transmitted to the Central Receiving and Dispatching Room through the armor cable. Clear symbols can be displayed on the wave receiving machine for the operator to copy. One end of the motor transport belt is equipped with a seat for the incoming telegram registration clerk, so that the foreign telegrams copied by each machine can be automatically transported, reducing delays. The opposite of the registration clerk is the seat for the dispatch and distribution clerks, so that their work can be connected to each other. Further in is a glass room. In addition to being equipped with telex machines for direct communication with various Chinese and foreign firms, it is also equipped with multiple telephones and assigned special personnel to be responsible for telephone delivery. The telegraph room upstairs and the receiving and dispatching office downstairs are connected by pneumatic tubes to transmit telegrams, which can be reached in an instant and is extremely flexible.</p>
<p>The situation of the General Receiving and Dispatching Office - The General Receiving and Dispatching Office is located downstairs from the Central Receiving and Dispatching Office. The front door faces Renji Road, and a side door is opened in the Sassoon Building. Various gold characters of direct circuits are painted on the glass window, and a neon sign is installed at the entrance, which is dazzling. The counter inside is long in shape and is divided into Japanese, Foreign, Domestic, and Inquiry departments. Each department has special personnel in charge to respond in a thoughtful manner. The on-duty receiving and dispatching clerks also have numbers marked outside to indicate responsibility. On the wall is a black background color world countries direct reporting place name table, interspersed with colorful lights, which is interesting. Its facilities and management are very scientific and artistic. The station's reputation in society is well deserved.</p>
<p>The organization of the International Radio Station - The station is the only state-owned autonomous communication agency for foreign countries, so the organization should strive for perfection. The following is an investigation of the support of the staff of the station. I hope that all sectors will know it.</p>
<p>Managing Engineer One person Oversees the entire station's engineering business</p>
<p>Business Director One person Manages the entire station's telegraph and business</p>
<p>Telegraph Director One person Manages the telegraph service</p>
<p>Receiving and Dispatching Director One person Manages the business</p>
<p>Chief Receiving and Dispatching Officer Several people Responsible for the responsibility of receiving and dispatching</p>
<p>Chief Business Inspector One person Inspects business matters</p>
<p>Business Inspector Several people Same as above</p>
<p>Engineering Director One person Manages the entire station's engineering</p>
<p>Engineer Several people Handles engineering</p>
<p>Affairs Director One person Manages the entire station's affairs</p>
<p>Direct Reporting Place Names of International Radio Station - The station was founded in the 17th year of the Republic of China. As the business gradually increased, it has successively engaged in the opening of direct circuits. Up to now, it has become a grand view. Almost all famous cities in the world communicate directly with the station. The following are the direct reporting place names:</p>
<p>1. Sino-American Route (San Francisco Joint Company Circuit) 2. Sino-American Route (San Francisco McKay Company Circuit) 3. Sino-German Route (Berlin) 4. Sino-French Route (Paris) 5. Sino-Russian Route (Moscow) 6. Sino-Swiss Route (Geneva) 7. Sino-British Route (London) 8. Sino-Philippine Route (Manila) 9. Sino-Vietnamese Route (Saigon) 10. Sino-Dutch Route (Batavia) 11. Sino-Japanese Route (Tokyo) 12. Shanghai-Hong Kong Route (Hong Kong) 13. Sino-Italian Route (Rome)</p>
<p>Advantages of the International Radio Station's facilities - When the reporter visited the station, he made a detailed observation of the facilities of each department. The following is a summary of the impressions I gained:</p>
<p>(A) The station's telegraph room is well-organized, and the personnel are properly distributed. The supervisors are well-managed, which is commendable. All the staff rarely smoke, talk, etc., and they are all dedicated to their work and full of energy, which is especially commendable.</p>
<p>(B) The female staff who deliver telephone calls have clear pronunciation and are quick in handling affairs, which is enough to give a good impression to the recipients.</p>
<p>(C) The receiving and dispatching office is simple in layout, the staff move quickly, and the clothing is neat and upright, which is truly commendable.</p>
<p>(D) The station's work uses the latest wave receiving machine, high-speed automatic transmitting machine, keyboard punching machine, etc. Therefore, incoming and outgoing telegrams have paper strips and clear symbols, and there are proofreaders to correct various paper strips and report bottoms at any time, so no errors occur.</p>
<p>New Business of International Radio Station - After the reporter finished visiting the various departments, he had a friendly conversation with Mr. Wang Shixin, the receiving and dispatching director of the station, in his private capacity. In order to inquire about the future business plan, according to his expression, in addition to the telephone receiving and dispatching telegrams and the collection of telegrams by all post and telecommunications bureaus in the city that the station has implemented, it has also adopted the method of sending people to collect telegrams, equipped with motorized bicycles, and sending receiving and dispatching clerks fluent in English to go to collect them at any time upon the request of the sender, and carry the station to send them. Since the creation of this method, all circles have praised its convenience. This is also a new business of the station to serve the society, which is very fortunate.</p>
<p>The Reporter's Opinion - Shanghai is a place where Chinese and foreigners live together, and it is the commercial center of East Asia. The number of foreign telegrams sent and received accounts for almost half of the country's total. However, the income of the station has not reached a considerable proportion. In the reporter's humble opinion, this is due to the deep-rooted history of foreign water line companies, but people from all walks of life have not fully understood the facilities and position of the station, and the effect of cooperation has not been achieved. In the future, all circles should be enthusiastic about "loving and using domestic goods" and cooperate with the station. If there are suggestions for improvement, they can be provided to the supervisors of the station for reference at any time. The Chinese staff of each service foreign firm should also make their conscientious proposals to help the station's development. This is the reporter's sincere prayer.</p>
<h3>A GlimPSE OF THE OLD WAY NEWSPAPERS WERE DELIVERED</h3>
<p>— Ju'ao</p>
<p>In recent years, the transportation authorities have spared no effort in improving telecommunications services. Progress has been made in machinery, organization, management, and other aspects, with the aim of "increasing speed" and facilitating the public. This publication has repeatedly reported on this, so there is no need to go into detail. What is being discussed here is something that is usually not valued by people, but in reality, it is greatly related to the speed of telegrams. What is it? It is the effective rectification of the method of telegram delivery by messengers.</p>
<p>In the past, when telegram messengers delivered telegrams, the telegraph office did not divide the areas or set time limits, and there were no restrictions on the number of telegrams delivered each time. How well did the messengers deliver the telegrams? How courteous were they to the recipients? No investigation was conducted. Other things, such as demanding tips for alcohol, were not strictly prohibited. As a result, telegrams were inevitably delayed, and the public's impression of the telegraph office deteriorated. Realizing this, the authorities issued a rectification of the method of delivering telegrams on January 1 of this year. The main points are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Each telegraph office should divide the delivery area into several zones. The telegrams that the messenger carries each time should be limited to those belonging to the same zone and adjacent zones, and they must return to the office within a limited time. The round trip time for each zone and the delivery time for each telegram should be calculated together. For commercial firms, organizations, or individuals that receive a large number of telegrams, a dedicated messenger should be assigned to deliver them within a limited time, if possible.</p>
<p>(2) Each telegraph office should arrange the messenger shifts with reference to the daily telegram traffic volume and the number of messengers available, with the principle of assigning more people when the telegram traffic is busy and fewer people when the telegram traffic is light. The number of telegrams to deliver at one time will be limited to a maximum of three.</p>
<p>(3) The responsible personnel of each telegraph office should use the following methods to check the messenger's delivery performance day and night, and whether there are any demands for alcohol money. For telegraph offices with particularly heavy telegram traffic, an inspector can be appointed to handle this matter:</p>
<p>A. Telephone inquiry: After the messenger leaves the telegraph office, call the recipient and ask them to notify the delivery time when the messenger delivers a certain telegram.</p>
<p>B. On-site inquiry: After the messenger departs, immediately ride a bicycle to the recipient's location to inquire about the delivery time.</p>
<p>These measures have been implemented for half a year, and the delivery speed has indeed improved, and the practice of demanding tips for alcohol has almost disappeared. This is well known to the public and does not require the reporter to elaborate. However, the implementation of these measures relies heavily on the cooperation of the public. Here, we sincerely put forward two points, hoping that all sectors of society will pay attention to them: The telegram return receipt has a "received time" item printed on it. This time is set to check whether the messenger delayed the delivery. Please be sure to accurately sign the time when you receive the telegram for verification purposes. One. Also, the time for the messenger to leave the office for delivery is limited. If more than one telegram is delivered, please do not detain the messenger for no reason to avoid delaying other people's telegrams and causing the messenger to return to the office after the time limit and be punished. This is the second. Both of these points are not inconvenient for the recipient, but they are of great help to the telegraph office's inspection. This is our sincere hope.</p>
<h3>JIANGNAN RAILWAY STATIONS ACCEPT AND DELIVER TELEGRAMS ON BEHALF OF THE TELEGRAPH OFFICE</h3>
<p>— Reporter</p>
<p>The Jiangnan Railway, from Nanjing to Xuancheng, which is run by the Jiangnan Company, has been opened to traffic. In order to facilitate communication for the public along the route, the Ministry of Transportation has approved the Wuhu Telegraph Office to entrust the stations along the route to collect and deliver telegrams on its behalf before the railway is connected to the telegraph office for communication. The method has been set and will be tested starting on July 1. For telegrams sent by the public from each station, except for those collected by the Zhonghuamen, Caishi, Dangtu, Wuhu, and Xuancheng stations, which are directly delivered to the local telegraph office for forwarding, they should be transmitted by telephone to the above stations and then handed over to the telegraph office for delivery or forwarding. Telegrams sent from the telegraph office to each station are also handed over to the above stations for telephone transmission and delivery. However, the telegrams collected and sent on behalf of the telegraph office are temporarily limited to ordinary domestic telegrams and express telegrams. The telegraph fees collected will be handled in accordance with the regulations of the telegraph office. If the recipient's address is too far from the station, a delivery fee may be charged, which will also be paid in accordance with the telegraph office's special delivery fee regulations. In addition, no other fees will be charged to the public.</p>
<p>On the telegraph office's side, it must pay a handling fee for each telegram (two cents for ordinary clear text, four cents for coded text or foreign language. Four cents for express clear text, eight cents for coded text or foreign language) to the railway. Therefore, the telegraph fees earned are only 80%, and the remaining 20% is the railway's handling fee. This handling fee becomes the line crossing fee when the railway and the telegraph office have a line connection contract. Before March of last year, the line crossing fees for all state-owned railway stations that collected and delivered telegrams on behalf of the telegraph office were paid by the public who sent and received telegrams. In other words, in addition to paying the ordinary telegraph fee, the public who sent and received telegrams also had to pay a 20% line crossing fee, which was not convenient for communication. The Ministry of Transportation has specially stipulated that starting in March of the 23rd year, the line crossing fees that the railway telegraph office should pay to the railway bureau will be paid under the telegraph fee item, and will no longer be collected from the public who send and receive telegrams. Although this will result in a considerable loss for the Ministry of Transportation every year, it is not taken into account if it benefits the public.</p>
<p>Various transportation undertakings each have their own functions, but without communication links, it is difficult to show their great effects, or even lead to great dangers in the future without being able to prevent them. Therefore, railways, highways, airplanes, and ships must have telecommunications equipment, and then their benefits will be significant. Just like a person, railways, highways, airplanes, and ships are like limbs, and telecommunications are like the blood vessels.</p>
<p>The Jiangnan Railway is equipped with telephone equipment, which has become a modern transportation system. Now that it has signed an agreement with the telegraph office to collect and deliver telegrams on its behalf, not only will passengers on the line and the public near the stations have communication convenience, but the line itself has also been linked to various transportation agencies across the country. The future development of the line's business is immeasurable, and the telecommunications business run by the Ministry of Transportation will also penetrate into various places along the route.</p>
<h3>INSTALLATION OF PUBLIC TELEPHONES AT STATIONS</h3>
<p>— Zhongxian</p>
<p>In order to facilitate communication for passengers, the Ministry of Transportation has decided to set up postal and telecommunications agencies at various railway stations. Regarding the postal and telegraphic parts, the Shanghai Postal Administration and the Shanghai Telegraph Office have already directly negotiated with the Jinghu and Huhu-Yong Railways Administration to test the plan at various stations along the two lines. Regarding the public telephone section, since the Ministry of Transportation decided to first test the plan at various stations along the Jinghu and Huhu-Yong Railways and ordered the Shanghai Telephone Bureau to contact the Railways Administration nearby to handle the matter, after consultation, they jointly drafted a "Provisional Measures for the Jinghu and Huhu-Yong Railways to Provide Public Telephone Service." The Telephone Bureau and the Railways Administration separately submitted the plan to the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Railways for approval, and the two ministries successively ordered approval for the trial operation. At present, the locations of various stations along the Jinghu and Huhu-Yong Railways that already have telephone bureaus of the Ministry of Transportation are the capital, Shanghai, Suzhou, and Zhenjiang. The telephone bureaus in each of these places have been ordered to contact the local stations to set up public telephone retail outlets, which will soon become a reality. In addition, the locations of various stations along the two lines that already have privately-owned telephone companies are Wuxi, Changzhou, Kunshan, Jiaxing, Songjiang, Jiashan, Xiashi, and Fengjing. Hangzhou has a provincial telephone bureau. The Ministry of Transportation has also ordered the telephone companies in each of these places and requested the Zhejiang Provincial Government to directly negotiate with the local stations to set up public telephone retail outlets in accordance with the above provisional measures, which will gradually be implemented in the shortest possible time. The establishment of postal and telecommunications agencies at stations can be said to have been completed. From now on, when passengers arrive at the station and need to send telegrams or letters due to urgent matters, or communicate with relatives and family members, they can hand them over to the station's postal and telecommunications agency for sending or use the public telephone to make calls nearby, which is very convenient!</p>
<p>The establishment of postal and telecommunications agencies at stations certainly provides great convenience to passengers. In particular, the equipment of public telephone retail outlets is urgently needed by the general public. Generally, when passengers are rushing around, they often forget important items, or after arriving at the station, they remember that there are still important matters to be explained to relatives or family members. If they want to leave the station again to retrieve the items or talk to relatives, they really do not have enough time because the train is about to depart. If they resolutely ignore the situation and leave, they will inevitably miss the opportunity. If they insist on turning back, they will inevitably delay their journey due to the time spent. Also, if several friends are going to a certain place together and agree to meet at the station at a certain time, if one person does not arrive at the station on time, everyone else will be anxious. Now that there are public telephone retail outlets at the station, if any of the above situations occur, they can immediately use the telephone to solve the problem. Even if there is no telephone installed at home, they can connect to the home of a relative or friend who has a local telephone nearby and ask them to relay the message. This is one of the ways that the station's public telephone serves passengers.</p>
<p>Secondly, when we travel from place A to place B, if we have too much luggage or if we are not familiar with the address of relatives and friends in place B, we must have relatives and friends in place B come to the station to pick us up when the train arrives. We can only notify the other party in advance by express mail or telegram so as not to cause any misunderstandings. However, after the station has a public telephone, if we know that our relatives and friends in place B have a local telephone installed at home or that a nearby telephone can be borrowed, we can wait until the train arrives at the station in place B to make a phone call, which is even simpler. This is also one of the ways that the station's public telephone serves passengers.</p>
<p>As for passengers who want to talk to their relatives and friends about urgent matters after arriving at a certain place by train, they can use the public telephone to talk to their relatives and friends as soon as the train arrives at the station in a certain place, and agree on the time and place to meet, which is especially convenient. Other matters, such as asking about familiar taxi companies to hire taxis after arriving at the station, can be arranged by making a phone call nearby. In addition, reporters on outside assignments from newspaper offices can use the public telephone to call the newspaper office at any time to report news or people's whereabouts, which is also quite quick. From this, it can be seen that the effectiveness of the station's public telephone is extremely broad, and it is not only convenient for passengers.</p>
<h3>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF REVISING THE EMPLOYEE TRANSFER ALLOWANCE TABLE</h3>
<p>— De</p>
<p>When telecommunications employees are transferred, they are entitled to receive travel expenses in accordance with the regulations. However, this allowance table was formulated by the Ministry of Transportation in Beijing in the 12th year of the Republic of China, more than ten years ago. Not only are the conditions in various places very different now and in the past, but in recent years, highway construction in various provinces has developed rapidly, and transportation conditions have changed dramatically. Therefore, the allowance table set earlier is no longer practical. Whenever employees are transferred from place A to place B, how much travel expenses should be paid? There is no fixed standard, so some bureaus submit requests to the Ministry for instructions, while others pay a certain amount in advance from the starting bureau and then submit a report to the Ministry for verification by the arrival bureau. Sometimes, the Ministry orders the Management Bureau to review the matter nearby. The situations vary, and the methods are different from each other. Not only are the methods different, and the responsible personnel often feel difficult, but the paperwork is complicated, delays the time, and can easily lead to mistakes. Recently, the Ministry has realized this and decided to revise the allowance table to suit the current transportation conditions.</p>
<p>The procedure for revising the allowance table is extremely complicated. There are approximately 1,800 telegraph and telephone bureaus across the country. Transportation in various places can be divided into trains, cars, ships, sailboats, and old-fashioned sedan chairs and carriages. Which type of transportation is commonly used in which place, or which types of transportation are used together? How many days will it take to travel from place A to place B, and how much will the travel expenses be? Each of these things must be investigated clearly before accurate regulations can be made.</p>
<p>The steps are divided into: (1) Investigation, (2) Review, (3) Revision. The first step is to start the investigation work, ordering each Management Bureau to reply on the transportation conditions between the bureaus in their province, so as to make a map. (Using different colored lines to represent railways, highways, waterways, and land routes, etc.) At the same time, they are asked to obtain price lists and schedules for cars, trains, and ships from the highway and automobile management agencies in various provinces, railway bureaus, and state-owned China Merchants Bureau, etc. for reference. The second step is to review each one after the replies from each Management Bureau and the price lists and schedules have been compiled. The third step is to formulate three types of allowance tables: railways, highways, and provinces. How much travel expenses are required from place A to place B? How much travel expenses are required from place B to place C? How much travel expenses are required from place A to place C? By analogy, the complexity of travel expenses between bureaus across the country can be imagined, so they must be specified separately for clarity.</p>
<p>After this allowance table is set, not only will the methods be unified and can be followed, but there will be a fixed standard for issuing allowances or reviewing books. There is no need to repeatedly inquire and waste time. Even in terms of reducing the official documents for reviewing travel expenses, it can also improve work efficiency invisibly. The reporter believes that although this work is tedious, it is also a work of renewal in our telecommunications administration.</p>
<h3>INNOVATION IN THE ORGANIZATION OF TELEGRAPH ENGINEERING</h3>
<p>— Yue</p>
<p>After the 18th year of the Republic of China, telegraph lines were divided into trunk lines and branch lines. The trunk lines were maintained by the Engineering Office, and the branch lines were maintained by the various telegraph bureaus. A total of ten trunk line Engineering Offices were established one after another. They are: HuhHan (i.e., Shanghai-Hankou Line), HuhYiGuan (i.e., Shanghai-Fuzhou Line), QingHuh (i.e., Shanghai-Qingdao Line), JinPu (i.e., Tianjin-Pukou Line), FuGuang (i.e., Fuzhou-Guangzhou Line), HanPing (i.e., Hankou-Beiping Line), HanYu (i.e., Hankou-Ba County Line), YanJi (i.e., Yantai-Jinan Line), PingYu (i.e., Beiping-Erlianhot and Beiping-Linyu Lines), GuangYong (i.e., Guangzhou-Nanning Line), directly under the Ministry of Transportation. The branch lines maintained by the various bureaus are under the Telecommunications Administration Bureau. It is reported that in order to unify management, the Ministry of Communications will abolish all trunk line Engineering Offices starting in July. Regardless of whether they are trunk lines or branch lines, they will all be maintained by the various bureaus and will be under the Telecommunications Administration Bureau. In the Telecommunications Administration Bureaus of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Sichuan, and Guizhou provinces, additional engineers will be assigned to guide the bureaus in maintaining and improving the lines. Jiangsu Province is divided into four zones, with engineers stationed in Nanjing, Shanghai, Xiannvmiao, and Huaiyin bureaus. Zhejiang Province has two zones, stationed in Hangzhou and Lanxi bureaus. Fujian Province has three zones, stationed in Fuzhou, Pucheng, and Xiamen bureaus. Anhui Province has three zones, stationed in Huaining, Wuhu, and Bengbu bureaus. Jiangxi Province has three zones, stationed in Nanchang, Jiujiang, and Linchuan bureaus. Hubei Province has three zones, stationed in Hankou, Shashi, and Laohekou bureaus. Hunan Province has three zones, stationed in Changsha, Hengyang, and Hongjiang bureaus. Henan Province has two zones, stationed in Zheng County and Xuchang bureaus. Hebei Province has three zones, stationed in Beiping, Tianjin, and Shijiazhuang bureaus. Shandong Province has three zones, stationed in Jinan, Qingdao, and Yantai bureaus. Sichuan Province has four zones, stationed in Ba County, Wan County, Chengdu, and Lu County bureaus. Guizhou Province has two zones, stationed in Guiyang and Bijie bureaus, in order to be thorough. The original line worker's routine patrol (i.e., one patrol every ten days or five days) will also be stopped starting in July. The patrol team will be reorganized to patrol the lines, depending on the importance of the lines to determine the number of patrols. Important lines will be patrolled once a month, and less important lines will be patrolled once every two months. The patrol team will still consist of the original three to five line workers and five to eight hired laborers, led by the foreman, carrying the appropriate materials, and patrolling on time. The patrol sections will be determined by the engineers nearby. A patrol team will have at least nine people. If they find any bad conditions of the poles and lines in the middle of the patrol, they can repair them at any time. Although there are fewer opportunities to inspect the lines, its efficiency may be better than the monthly routine patrols of individual line workers.</p>

<p>SHEN BAO LOCAL SUPPLEMENT</p>
<p>TALK</p>
<h3>LABOR COMMUNES FOR CRIMINALS</h3>
<p>— Mengruo</p>
<p>The tendency to eliminate crime should be addressed through rehabilitation, not punishment. As Lao Tzu said, "If the people do not fear death, what is the use of frightening them with death?" When a person is forced by their living environment to a point where they cannot survive, they dare to do anything, no matter how serious. They will not fear even the strictest laws. Therefore, in recent times, a portion of psychologists, criminologists, and sociologists in Europe and the United States advocate adopting rehabilitation policies to eliminate criminal behavior. The power of rehabilitation far outweighs any severe punishment.</p>
<p>As far as we know, all civilized countries with the rule of law in the world today have established reformatories for the purpose of implementing rehabilitation policies. However, these reformatories only accommodate juvenile offenders and have not yet been extended to all offenders. This is inevitably a defect. This is probably because people believe that children's personalities are not yet fixed and that adults are more easily rehabilitated.</p>
<p>I heard that in the socialist country of Soviet Russia, in addition to reformatories, there is also an organization called labor communes for criminals. These communes do not use imprisonment for criminals, nor do they use oppression or punishment. They purely use educational work to eliminate their tendency to commit crimes. In Soviet Russia, there are a total of fourteen labor communes in the country, of which the Bolshevo Commune is the most famous. The Bolshevo Commune has been established for ten years. When it was first established, there were only eighteen prisoners, but now it has increased to three thousand and one hundred people. The initial equipment of the factories only included a carpentry workshop, a shoe repair workshop, and a key workshop. Today, there are weaving factories and sports equipment manufacturing factories. At present, this commune has developed into a small city. There are no police officers inside, and there are only six managers who manage the outdoor work of these three thousand and one hundred members. There are huge buildings, meeting halls, gyms, and cinemas. Cultural and educational work is most important in the commune. All members must receive education. Each member is required to stay here for three years. However, most members are willing to live here for life. Some former members are now serving in various towns and villages and are no longer guilty. The current deputy manager and social work instructor of the commune were also their companions in the past.</p>
<p>The establishment of this kind of labor commune for criminals in Soviet Russia is obviously very different from the ordinary prison system. The former uses educational work to eliminate the criminal behavior of prisoners. The latter uses punishment to warn offenders from committing crimes again. On the surface, labor communes are much more lenient than prisons, and it seems that they are not enough to change the criminal tendencies of prisoners. However, in terms of results, the former is actually better than the latter. The most appropriate way to improve the behavior of prisoners is to adopt rehabilitation policies. If punishment is used in a simplistic way, it will have little effect. This is a fact that has been recognized by many criminologists in recent times.</p>
<h3>ROBBING</h3>
<p>— Siquan</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the sun was like a pot of fire, covering people's heads, but the people in the town of Zhijiao did not dare to be lazy in their houses. Underneath the large coolie hats wriggling in the fields were purple-black faces that had lost their humanity!</p>
<p>On the road to the town, the ground had cracked, and the sunlight would not let go, shooting into the ground. A stray dog with a blood-red tongue lay panting under a tree like a sick person, its ribs heaving up and down under its belly, perhaps it hadn't chewed on a bone for three days: no, a pile of shit.</p>
<p>Far away, a man came walking, cultured, the kind of measured pace probably the first discovery since this road was opened. He was a city man, wearing a silk gown, a nice coolie hat, and naturally a paper fan swaying lightly in his hand. To make a somewhat unsuitable analogy, perhaps he was a poetry-reciting bookworm.</p>
<p>As he walked past the big tree where the stray dog was lying, he bent his back as if he were a pig thief and shot into Fushang Bo's house like an arrow.</p>
<p>Fushang Bo had not gone to the fields, he was sick, suffering from longing for his son. He had a filial son, who this year when the peach blossoms were in bloom, fell ill with a serious illness that even the magic remedies in the Guanyin Temple could not cure. In just ten days, a man who could lift a hundred pounds of burden with one hand was carried by two children to be buried in the wild. The two grandsons were still young, they could not shoulder the burden that had fallen from their father, so they were sent to the city to apprentice. Fushang Bo did not want to do this, at least the old man had not yet reached the point of not producing, but he was sick: the two children ate more than their father, so the daughter-in-law sent them to the city without asking his permission.</p>
<p>Misfortunes never come singly, blessings never come in pairs, Fushang Bo did not get any light from his name. Less than seven days after his son died, Zhang Daye's steward, A Xing, came aggressively to take back the land.</p>
<p>"Your son is dead, can you still farm at this age? The master's land was bought at a high price, if it is left uncultivated, your old life will not be enough to compensate, quickly take out the deed! The master is especially gracious, your rent arrears from last year are waived."</p>
<p>Zhang Daye's words had never been discounted, the land was taken back, but the rent arrears were not waived, A Xing would come to Fushang Bo's house to bark like that stray dog from time to time.</p>
<p>Fushang Bo thought of his own bad luck, and could not help but sigh on the bed. He hoped that his grandsons would grow up to have the same strength as their father and crush Zhang Daye and A Xing into a lump of flesh. But Zhang Daye was psychic, he was already standing in front of Fushang Bo's bed. Fushang Bo opened his old eyes, he hoped it was a dream, but Zhang Daye had already sat down in front of his bed, that always elongated face unexpectedly wearing a hint of a smile today. Fushang Bo panicked and did not know what to do, he wanted to shout to his daughter-in-law to boil a bowl of tea or something, Zhang Daye personally came to the village, this trouble was too big.</p>
<p>"Fushang, don't you recognize me, Zhang Daye? I came to see your illness." Zhang Daye's tall voice was suppressed so weakly, but he was actually using all his strength.</p>
<p>"I dare not..." Fushang Bo wanted to prop himself up from the bed to kowtow to Zhang Daye, "I dare not, Master Zhang! I really can't get up... I'll send the rent arrears myself in a few days, Master Zhang..."</p>
<p>But Zhang Daye rushed to say, "I care about these few coins! I came to see your illness, A Xing said you were sick from missing your son. It's really pitiful, so young!" He seemed to be sighing, and then suddenly thought of something, "Where is your daughter-in-law?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Da Gou Niang, Master Zhang is here, boil a cup of tea!" Fushang Bo shouted with all his might.</p>
<p>"Don't rush, don't rush!" Zhang Daye covered Fushang Bo's mouth with his hand, even more softly, "I want to discuss with you, Xian Sheng, it's not a good way to keep a young daughter-in-law at home, A Lu's son in the front town wants to marry a wife, do you have this intention? Your rent arrears will be used as the betrothal gift." At the end, Zhang Daye lengthened his face again. Fushang Bo wanted to say something but had not opened his mouth, Daye patted his shoulder again:</p>
<p>"You are so old, and you don't ask a doctor when you are sick. I have five dollars here, take them to use first." Seeing that Fushang Bo did not reach out, that fickle magician widened his throat again, "Don't be ungrateful, even your rent arrears are more than thirty dollars. Listen, A Lu will come tonight to take the person!"</p>
<p>The flowered banknote hit Fushang Bo's chest like a bullet. Zhang Daye bent his back and slipped out of his house like a pig thief.</p>
<p>That night, Fushang Bo's daughter-in-law was robbed. The purple-black faces that had lost their humanity surrounded the sickbed like a large screen. They wanted to go to the city that night to inform Zhang Daye and ask Master Zhang to sentence A Lu that fellow for "forcibly robbing a widow"...</p>
<p>But Fushang Bo shook his head, he sighed his last breath.</p>
<h3>BATTLEFIELD</h3>
<p>— By Zhu Yanghui</p>
<h3>Holding a Diploma</h3>
<p>— Ge</p>
<p>When reading the enrollment advertisements in the newspapers, dear classmates, I know you are already joyfully holding your diplomas, throwing yourselves into your mother's arms. But remember, this is the last time. Therefore, even if I don't want to spoil the mood by talking about the "graduation equals unemployment" problem, I still want to ask, dear classmates, after holding your diplomas, what do you want to do?</p>
<p>If your parents can continue to provide you with the funds to pursue</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>your studies, then everything is not a problem. After the scorching summer vacation, you will still leave your mother's embrace, continue to go to university, or go abroad for further studies. Although there will eventually be a day when you wear a square hat and return home after completing your studies, the question of "what do you want to do?" can be put aside for a while.</p>
<p>Dear classmates, this question is now placed on the shoulders of those of you who want to "go out into the world." Please tell me, what do you want to do?</p>
<p>You naturally have many great aspirations, as you stated in your graduation theses. This is correct. Aspiration is a track. As long as you work hard and move forward, you will one day achieve the greatness you hope for. However, this track is smooth in school. Perhaps you can see the brilliant future ahead at a glance. In society, this track is full of thorns, which will completely waste your hard-won spirit, because before you have traveled even one-tenth of the way, perhaps it is already useless!</p>
<p>Dear classmates, you seem to have never heard such frustrating words: they were not read in books, nor did your teachers warn you. Then, let me tell you: a certain magazine held an essay contest on "the process of making a living" ("making a living" may not have been mentioned in your "grand aspirations," but your parents are hoping to recoup some of the costs from you!). Many young people said they had changed a dozen jobs in five or six years, and were never satisfied. I think if they were to respond to the contest a second time, they would definitely say they had changed twenty or so jobs, and that things were getting worse and worse.</p>
<p>You are still skeptical? Time waits for no one, and it is time for your golden dreams to wake up. At that time, I think, dear classmates, will you be very surprised? Then, you will abandon the attempt of "grand aspirations," and only worry about the bread that needs to be put into your hungry stomach every day. But here is another warning sign written in red—"oversupply of manpower!"</p>
<p>You are certainly so horrified that you are dizzy. You think that society and school are in two different worlds. You know that disaster relief in rural villages requires talent, revitalization of industry requires talent, and science, education... all require talent. How is it that suddenly there is an oversupply of talent? This mystery has left young people who have changed a dozen jobs completely confused.</p>
<p>In the end, it comes back to the mood-killing "graduation equals unemployment" problem. But, dear classmates, don't be frustrated, be rational. Society not only does not have an oversupply of talent, but also urgently needs talent. Therefore, I hope that after holding your diplomas, you will first think about "what to do?" Your vision can be far-reaching, but the foundation must be laid at your feet. Taking big steps is to stumble and fall!</p>
<p>Dear classmates, please forgive my nagging, and I wish you all achieve the grand aspirations in your graduation theses! Dimly</p>
<h3>Thinking from Manuscript Paper</h3>
<p>— Wei Mang</p>
<p>Whenever I open a piece of manuscript paper, a large pile of thoughts surges in my heart. Thinking of using manuscript paper to express inner thoughts, or to record society, life, and the ways of the world, although it has not been a very long time, it has not been very short either. Now, although the social relationships or friendships associated with manuscript paper have gradually expanded, the shadows that come with them have also gradually increased, causing people to lose their initial hope and freshness. Articles have become commodities, and the people who create articles can only become a kind of machine in a commercial society. Therefore, the darkness that is inevitable in a commercial society, and all kinds of hateful experiences, have also accumulated in my own life experience. So a drop of ink does not only represent a bit of heart's blood, but also makes me terrifyingly think of it as a stain on life. Now, a life of writing cannot be broken away from or removed, and it is becoming more and more stable and firm, filling me with hatred and terror for my future.</p>
<p>Yes, manuscript paper is a check, a tool that becomes a way to exchange money by piling crows on it. However, besides scribbling black characters on white paper, selling one's narrow knowledge in bits and pieces, or deceiving one's own reason with passion, and deceiving others, can people not maintain their lives with other things or other work? Do people have to spend their time and energy on the tip of a pen and paper, instead of applying it to other more useful and more powerful causes? Do people have to eat their own squeezed blood, and then trick others into sympathy and tears? If society really wants to force a certain kind of people to engage in the career of a writer, then society is certainly a bit ridiculous, and people are too small.</p>
<p>Many times I often hear writers cursing themselves, or even comparing writers' pens and paper to prostitutes selling laughter. This statement certainly has its points that deserve criticism, because the authors and their works of the past and present are not necessarily completely without value, or completely without benefit to human society, but undoubtedly, many black characters piled on white paper are not necessarily useful in every sheet, or pearly in every word. Then, aren't the products produced by writers' brains more worthless and more deserving of contempt than the products of workers or farmers? However, when people regard writers as a profession, then manuscript paper naturally becomes a kind of check, and words leave their inherent value and simply become commodities. How can you expect writers not to curse themselves, given reality?</p>
<p>Moreover, since writers have become a specialized profession, and every profession has its own darkness and stains. Therefore, the existence of darkness in the literary world is inevitable. Saying that the literary world is like the commercial world, or the literary world is like the officialdom, will inevitably be hated by people, and it is also a matter of course.</p>
<p>What is even more pitiful is that most writers have no strength to bind a chicken. They can't pick up a hoe, and they can't learn to use a saw. They can't use an abacus, and they can't fire a gun. Want to give up this profession and do some more practical work? People don't want it, and they can't do it themselves. Then they can only wait for rabbits by the stump, somersault in a narrow circle, and spend their lives in poverty and depression.</p>
<p>In China, although manuscript paper has also become a check, it is especially worthless. The exploitation of bookstore owners, and the low level of social needs, make a thousand words sell for at most three or five yuan, and that already makes your hands sore and your head hurt. Then, since its production is of no benefit to the people, it is also not worth looking at for yourself. It is difficult to get people to value manuscript paper.</p>
<p>Therefore, whenever I open a piece of manuscript paper, and the pen is just about to proceed onto the paper, these thoughts often stir up my low mood, and I helplessly fold the manuscript paper again and throw it into a corner. I wait quietly until I am hungry, and then I have to use the weight of a thousand catties to smear the pen on the paper.</p>
<h3>Dreams of a Water Village</h3>
<p>— Ke Ming</p>
<p>This summer, we have to stay in a dilapidated manor in Wuli Town to spend these hot days. Wuli Town is a small place near the water in the South. Although it is called a "town," it is actually just a dilapidated small teahouse on a single, half-mud, half-pebbled street, a paper cigarette shop that also does "Beijing-Guangzhou foreign goods business," a grain store, and a grocery store. In a small village with an area of one or two hundred acres, placing a narrow street and four small shops and calling it a "town" seems a bit incomprehensible, right? However, that doesn't matter: it's all the same: we have to spend the summer there this year.</p>
<p>The arrival of summer is like an attack in war. In the blink of an eye, spring drifts away like a dream, and then, without even giving you a chance to think, a scorching season lies in front of you. In early summer, we gained some small profits from trading. Therefore, when the fire-like heat came, we decided to find a short break in a place where we could live more simply and economically. In this way, we found this small, simple (almost primitive) Wuli Town.</p>
<p>It is a small village surrounded by water on three sides, a beautiful water village, said to be like a dream! There, for the two hundred or so local residents, land is not the main lifeline: there, on the few acres of land, people only grow light products such as mung beans and miscellaneous grains, and what is taken as the only basis for life is the water that undulates in the vast world day and night, and the ships that float on the water, most of which are rented from boaters, and a few of which have been passed down from ancestors. There, a family lives in one or two thatched huts. The men row boats all year round for a living, loading goods and passengers, going to nearby villages and distant villages. The women catch fish, shrimp, and aquatic animals in the river in spring and autumn, and take them to nearby towns to exchange for some pocket money. In winter and summer, they help with chores on the boats. The children are all endowed by life with a special nature of loving boats, loving water, loving danger, and loving drifting. From a young age, they enjoy picking up duckweed on the water, and by the age of seven or eight, they can dive in the center of the river alone. Generation after generation, people gradually learn to regard water as their hometown and boats as their home. From the time they grow up, they take over the heavy oars from the hands of the previous generation, and on bright days and on windy and rainy days, they drift in one place according to the wishes of the guests. By the time the age of fifty or so begins to mark their dark faces, they have seen so much water and mountains. Now, the person grows old, tired and decayed. Thus, just as he received this heavy mission from the hands of the previous generation when he was young, he also blesses the old boat and oars and bestows them on the children of the next generation.</p>
<p>However, people who grow up in water villages are endowed with a natural sense of open-mindedness. Even when they are old, they still have unlimited love for this vast water village. In the morning, they may go to the waterside to take a look, and kindly and proudly tell strangers about some of the scenery and customs of the water village. The old sailor's brown-gray face and the news that flows from his mouth are enough to fascinate young strangers. It is not happiness to live in account books and abacus beads! And think about the blue sky and the silver-flowered water of thousands of miles of open space! They teach people the ability to live, and encourage people to bravely wander out into the world, until they are old!</p>
<p>We spent the summer in this small village, and here, we all had dreams of a water village.</p>

<h3>Broadcasting News</h3>
<p>The song music that has long been praised and cherished is about to exceed the standard line. When this song music is surging in a rapid current, the people of the new school of songs are rising with this angry tide. Bihong Yinlang Society was founded by the new school song writer Nuta Tao (namely Cai Jianhun, the drama director of Jinan Film Company) and the song researcher Xu Mingyi. They are very determined in their handling of the society. In particular, Nu Tao Jun's creation of songs can be said to be establishing another style. Therefore, after the two gentlemen's encouragement, the ladies in the society have been flying so fast in recent months that no one can predict. They are making steady progress, so the hidden Bihong Yinlang Society has not yet been noticed. However, most of the ladies active in various radio stations recently are the main force of Bihong Society. It is said that the society will soon be fully mobilized.</p>

<h3>New Development and Newcomers of Jinan Film Company</h3>
<p>After Jinan Film Company was sealed off last year, it has been in a half-war state. The loss is very significant, and the parties are still trying to resolve it. On the one hand, the internal structure is reorganized and new talents are widely recruited. Once the entire matter is resolved, the company will officially innovate.</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the company, the company will soon be unsealed. As for the work, they will first complete the filming of "Spring of the Earth" directed by Yan Meng, and then continue to shoot "Stormy Night," which was written by Feng Yi and directed by Feng Ting. The script has profound implications and will be sent to Beijing for inspection soon. Feng Ting is a newcomer to the film industry. He is young and talented, and proficient in lyrics and music. He used to work hard as a writer at Great Wall Film Company, but due to lack of opportunity, he has been transferred for many years. This time it is his debut work, so he is extremely cautious about this script.</p>
<p>The songs were specially requested from Nu Tao, the organizer of Bihong Yinlang Society. Nu Tao is a new school song writer. The ladies who are active on various broadcasting stations are all the main force in his society. This time Nu Tao Jun is preparing to join "Stormy Night" as a whole. Wang Meng is cast in the film as the protagonist. Wang Meng is originally from Xiamen and grew up in Nanyang. She is eighteen years old, intelligent and lovely, and gifted with a singing voice. She also has the talent for silver art. Feng Ting resolutely ranks her as the leading lady. With so many talents, Xiangnan may have a turning point and a chance of survival?</p>
<h3>Listening to Yuan and Tang Discuss Acting While Lying Down</h3>
<p>The night is deep, and the surroundings are full of a quiet atmosphere. In the room opposite, music is playing again, He Luting's violin and Lü Ji's piano, playing a bright and clear concerto, like a lullaby.</p>
<p>The door opened, and Tang Na came in and lay down on an iron bed. Yuan Muzhi ran over to greet him. The music gradually faded, and a burst of dialogue arose: "Your attitude should be irritable, your voice should be stubborn, and your face should show lines of horizontal flesh. After the nurse comes to greet you, you should slowly calm down." "Should I look at her?" "Yes, yes..."</p>
<p>The music intensified again. Wu Yinxi's camera and Dai Shuzhou's microphone were activated at the same time after director Yuan Muzhi's command. The hospital scene of "City Scenery" was filmed vividly.</p>
<h3>Xia Peizhen's Trilogy</h3>

<p>The night wind sneaks in through the cracks in the window, and the sparks of the candle are blown flickering.</p>
<p>The mother on the sickbed groans sadly.</p>
<p>Outside the window, withered leaves lightly fall from the branches.</p>
<p>The mother's breathing quickens, her speechless lips move with all her strength, and her tearful, expressionless eyes stare at her only lifeline - Xia Peizhen. Finally, she dies!</p>
<p>Xia Peizhen goes crazy and screams wildly!</p>
<p>Second Movement</p>
<p>"Hey, let me tell you! Your brother-in-law has agreed to let you go to a church school!" said Yingyin, Xia Peizhen's sister.</p>
<p>"Really? Oh, my dearest sister!" Xia Peizhen jumped up with joy.</p>
<p>Third Movement</p>
<p>Under the neon lights, crazy people are drunk in the rhythm of jazz.</p>
<p>Smiling beautiful red lips!</p>
<p>Brother-in-law, handsome and beautiful brother-in-law, generous and affectionate brother-in-law! Xia Peizhen smiled by the champagne glass!</p>
<p>She smiled, and her brother-in-law also smiled!</p>
<p>The brother-in-law is truly: "Only see the little aunt smiling, but don't hear the wife crying!"</p>
<h3>Yihua Scenery Line</h3>
<p>Shen Tianyin has formally taken the position of manager of Yihua Company. He arrived at the company yesterday and was welcomed by Yihua colleagues.</p>
<p>Yue Feng's new work, "Doctor's Wife," is set to be a sound film. The rumor that it is a silent film is untrue. Filming will officially begin on the fifteenth.</p>
<p>The subtitles at the beginning of "Storm" are extremely unique.</p>
<p>Jin Yi, "Ammonia," plays the master in "Hero of the Times" and a farmer in "Triumphant Song."</p>
<p>Guan Hongda, the fat man, created a lot of laughs in "Triumphant Song."</p>
<p>Liang Jingsheng is quite busy recently with his new film "Storm" poster work.</p>
<p>The magic of Wei Heling's makeup was already evident in "The Beginning of Man." Now, the farmer's makeup in "Triumphant Song" is so unrecognizable that people don't know it's Wei Heling.</p>
<p>Wu Weiyun, the photographer of "Storm," is not only shooting "Storm" recently, but also working hard on the research and self-manufacturing of cameras.</p>
<p>Bao Tianming is in charge of the set design for "Doctor's Wife," and Wang Chunquan is the photographer. Yue Feng said: "It is to practice my principle of promoting newcomers."</p>

<h3>The Process of Local Construction and Building Materials (4)</h3>
<p>— Gu Ying</p>
<p>Timber Imports Up 4 Million This Year Compared to Same Period Last Year; Cement Imports Only One-Fifth of What They Were Three Years Ago Since Implementation of New Tax</p>
<p>Three, Cement:</p>
<p>Cement is an important raw material in modern construction. In the past, we relied solely on foreign supplies. Since the establishment of the Qixin Cement Company (taken over from a British company in the 33rd year of the Guangxu reign), domestic cement sales have gradually increased. Subsequently, companies such as China Cement Co., Ltd., and Shanghai Huashang Cement Co., Ltd., were successively established. Qixin had the highest production volume. Its factory was located in Tangshan, Hebei Province, and its trademark was the Horse Brand. Due to its excellent quality, it was favored by the Chinese people. In peak years, it produced over 2.2 million barrels annually. The next largest was China Cement Co., Ltd., with a factory located near Longtan Mountain in Jurong, Jiangsu Province. The trademark was the Taishan Brand, and production reached 800,000 barrels annually. The next largest was Shanghai Cement Co., Ltd., with a factory located in Longhua, Shanghai. The trademark was the Elephant Brand, and production reached a maximum of 500,000 barrels annually. Other companies, such as Huaji Hubei Company in Jinan, Zhijing Cement Company in Jinan, Henan Cement Factory, and Xicun Cement Factory in Guangzhou, produced the Lion Globe Brand, Flying Machine Brand, and Five Rams Brand, with a combined annual production of approximately 1.2 million barrels. Sales were highest between 1926 and 1930, due to the rapid advancement of the construction industry. Foreign cement imports were also substantial. From 1932 onwards, domestic products were hit hard by the increase in unified taxes, from 60 cents to 1.20 yuan per barrel, and by the low prices of foreign goods. Production declined sharply due to unsalability. In 1933, Qixin produced only 1,557,252 barrels, China 703,932 barrels, Shanghai 423,282 barrels, and other companies 892,640 barrels, representing a 44% decrease compared to peak production. However, foreign imports increased. Recognizing the crisis facing domestic cement, the government implemented increased customs duties. The new tax rate was 0.83 gold yuan per 100 kilograms, equivalent to 1.45 national currency yuan, to assist domestic cement and prevent loopholes. Since its implementation, imports have decreased sharply. Last year, the total value of imports was 1,036,958 customs gold yuan, a sharp decrease of more than 2.5 times compared to the 3,716,752 customs gold yuan in 1933. Compared to the 5,656,165 customs gold yuan in 1932, imports were only one-fifth. This is a good phenomenon, and the domestic cement industry may flourish in the future. The following is a comparative table of cement imports over ten years and a table of cement imports by country in the first quarter of this year for reference.</p>
<p>Year   Quantity (quintals)  Total Value (customs gold yuan)</p>
<p>1925   1,761,099   1,879,725</p>

In the peak years, imports exceeded 2,278,701 quintals, equivalent to 1,340,412 barrels (170 kilograms per barrel), and domestic production reached a maximum of 4.7 million barrels (domestic exports were minimal). The total maximum consumption in the country was about 6 million barrels, or about 22,286,000 pounds. This averages out to 5 pounds per capita, compared to 450 pounds per capita in the United States and 131 pounds in Japan, a difference of several tens of times. It is truly beyond our reach. The underdevelopment of cement consumption in our country is evident here. (The End)</p>
<h3>From Architectural Art to the Temples of Greece (2)</h3>
<p>— Sun Zongwen</p>
<p>——The Most Glorious Page in the History of World Architecture——</p>
<p>"The earth is like a woman, and the Parthenon is the most beautiful pearl she wears:"</p>
<p>Also praising the sculptural art of the goddess Athena enshrined in this temple:</p>
<p>"No Greek is happy unless he has seen the sculpture of Athena!"</p>
<p>From this, we can see how famous Greek art is throughout the world! Therefore, there is an idiom that says:</p>
<p>"Whatever I see that is beautiful comes from Greece!"</p>
<p>Since architectural art has a consistent and close relationship with the history of world art, and Greek art is especially admired by the world, and the emergence of its temples is the result of religious thought; therefore, we can assert that Greek temples are the only crystallization of architectural art. Therefore, we cannot talk about architectural art without talking about the temple architecture of Greece; because it is the most glorious page in the history of world architecture! Therefore, we must write about it extensively!</p>
<p>(1) The Influence of Greek National Character on Architectural Art</p>
<p>Since the rise of the Neoclassical movement in Western Europe in the middle of the eighteenth century, modern people have begun to recognize the preciousness of Greek art, and have made many contributions, especially in architecture. Therefore, those who study the history of architecture in the world all start with this Greek architectural art, and among them, religious architecture is the most important; that is, the "temple architecture" that this article will talk about; from this, we can infer other architectural arts.</p>
<p>We firmly believe that architecture is the crystallization of the spirit of the times; in other words, we can recognize the national character of an era from a certain building. Greek temples are a powerful ironclad proof. To talk about its problems, we should study the human geography of Greece; because these are extremely related and extremely important to the evolution of architecture.</p>
<p>Greek culture can be said to be the origin of world literature and art; because Greek culture is most related to its geography; because the weather is warm, and the scenery is beautiful, so the people are intelligent and full of ideas. Due to the curvature of the coastline, there are many good harbors, so navigation, colonization, and industry and commerce are extremely developed; also, because it faces the most ancient civilizations of Egypt and Asia Minor across the sea, it already had culture in the Bronze Age; at the same time, because the city-states in the country compete with each other, the excellent culture in the country gradually spread to all parts of the world; therefore, its architectural art and style also spread to various countries around the world; so that people all over the earth deeply recognized the inherent art of Greek architecture.</p>
<p>The Greeks have a fervent belief in religion. They believe that everything in nature is governed by gods. If we read Greek mythology now, it is all stories about gods, which can serve as a powerful ironclad proof. Therefore, the number of religious buildings, temples, in the country is also conceivable. In addition to this, the Greeks also like sports, and there are often competitions; every four years, they are held in Olimpia; people from all over gather together. In addition to competing in physical strength and literature and art, they also have many opportunities to exchange and compete in the art and culture of various places. As a result, the architectural styles of various places have also produced beautiful and new effects. From this point of view, the Greek national character is artistic and religious; due to the relationship between art and religion, and also influenced by the brilliant Egyptian art of ancient civilization, they created the temple architectural art unique to the Greeks. This is the origin of the "Greek temple architecture". But it is a pity! The relics of this kind of temple have almost disappeared in modern times. Even if there are, they are just some broken sculptures, now preserved in the Royal Antiquities Museum in the United Kingdom, only for future generations to mourn!</p>
<h3>Several Applied "Examples" in Construction</h3>
<p>— Zhen Huan</p>
<p>—Also about the use on construction sites—</p>
<p>In modern materially civilized countries, construction, notably in places like England and the United States, has become a "superbly positioned" competitive business. However, in our old China, lagging behind in everything, the construction industry has gradually shown a vigorous trend in recent years. Therefore, the output of people who make a living on construction sites is simply difficult to count. However, this industry is not like being a shop assistant in an incense shop, where you can just casually do the work. At least you have to hang around on a construction site for two or three years, ask for some "secrets" from experienced veterans, learn some "thresholds", such as the several types of "calculations" regarding daily use on construction sites mentioned in this article, which are not as simple as a banker specializing in using an abacus to work on every last thread and hair.</p>
<p>Now I will write down some "examples" in different categories. Even if readers who make a living on construction sites cannot "understand them without a teacher" after reading them, remembering them in their minds can also be used as a reference.</p>
<p>Oregon Pine</p>
<p>(Explanation) It can be said that Oregon pine is everyone's income on construction sites. Regardless of the size of the project, it has a share everywhere. It is commonly used for doors and windows, footrests, picture frame moldings, etc., as well as formwork panels for building steel-reinforced concrete houses. In short, Oregon pine is an indispensable necessity on construction sites, just like how meals cannot be eaten without bowls and chopsticks.</p>
<p>Oregon pine is calculated in inches. Assuming there is a piece of Oregon pine that is 3 inches high, 6 inches wide (commonly called three-six), and 16 feet long, the method of calculation is:</p>
<p>That is the volume of the Oregon pine</p>
<p>(Note: The next to the Arabic numeral represents inches, and the represents feet. This is a common symbol on construction sites.) However, calculating in this way is inevitably troublesome, and sometimes it is easy to make mistakes. There is a simple formula for converting inches on construction sites. If you are familiar with it, you can convert the numbers of three inches and six inches in advance according to the conversion formula, and then multiply by the number of 16 feet, so you can save the step of dividing by twelve. (Note: Twelve is the number of inches in one foot. The foot system used on construction sites is calculated in English feet, with eight minutes making one inch and twelve inches making one foot.) Now, the conversion formula is recorded on the left,</p>
<p>1 inch — ·0835 2 inches — ·166 3 inches — ·25</p>
<p>4 inches — ·333 5 inches — ·416 6 inches — ·5</p>
<p>7 inches — ·583 8 inches — ·666 9 inches — ·75</p>
<p>10 inches — ·833 11 inches — ·916 12 inches — ·1·00</p>
<p>According to the above formula, take a piece of Oregon pine that is 3 inches high, 6 inches wide, and 16 feet long again. The calculation method is to multiply 3 inches by 6 inches, which gives 18 inches. Now it should be clear that 18 inches minus 12 inches is only 6 inches, and 12 inches is one foot, and 6 inches is half a foot. Then, 18 inches is one and a half feet. Multiply one and a half feet (6 inches) by 16 feet. The way to calculate this is:</p>
<p>24 feet is the volume of one piece of Oregon pine. You can use this method to calculate Oregon pine, and there will be no mistakes.</p>
<p>Brick</p>
<p>(Explanation) The bricks used for building walls on construction sites are most commonly from Hongjiatan, Xiadianmiao, Luxu, and Zhensu, and the 25 green bricks from Hongjiatan are more commonly used to build ordinary rental houses. In recent years, the new No. 3 bricks from Luxu with dimensions of 9.1 inches, 4.5 inches, and 1.6 inches, and the No. 3 bricks from Zhensu with dimensions of 9 inches, 4.5 inches, and 2.1 inches have been gradually adopted. Other materials such as Malkang aerated concrete bricks and Yipin Dazhong hollow bricks are needed to reduce the load in the construction of high-rise buildings. There are also Taishan facing bricks, which are only used to decorate facades.</p>
<p>Calculating bricks (note: this is only the calculation of the cargo tallymen on the construction site, not the volume of the bricks themselves or how many there are per square), except for the so-called "vertical chimney" method which has disappeared now, almost all use the method of counting "tiers" (details in construction jargon). However, here should also be a simple statement, a tier is the number of layers of bricks, there are names such as five tiers, seven tiers, nine tiers, etc. For example, if the number of layers is five skins, it is five tiers, seven skins is seven tiers, nine skins is nine tiers... The calculation method is to assume that there are 12 bricks in the first skin on the ground, 11 bricks in the second skin, 10 bricks in the third skin, 9 bricks in the fourth skin, and 8 bricks in the fifth skin. Then we can add them up layer by layer, which equals 50 bricks. However, the bricks piled on the construction site are not so few, almost piled in the thousands and tens of thousands. If you go to calculate them one by one, isn't it too complicated and time-consuming? Now there is a convenient way, just multiply the number of bricks in the middle skin (i.e., the third skin) by the total number of skins, and you will get the number. So we know that the third skin has 10 bricks, and the number of tiers is five, so multiply 10 by 5 equals 50 bricks. If it is seven tiers, count the fourth skin, nine tiers count the fifth skin, and so on. In short, use the middle skin as the standard.</p>
<p>Yellow Sand &amp; Stone</p>
<p>(Explanation) Yellow sand and stone are indispensable materials for building cement houses. Yellow sand is produced in Ningbo and Huzhou, and stone is produced in Jinshan and Tianpingshan. However, there are many byproducts of stone, such as sunflower seed chips, fly chips, etc.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, yellow sand and stone are calculated in tons. Each cubic meter is equal to 2.16 tons. (Note: Each cubic meter is 100 cubic feet.) Commonly, it is calculated by the carriers on the construction site. Each 26 full baskets of yellow sand or stone is one cubic meter, but the interior still uses "volume measurement" for calculation. For example, if the yellow sand or stone is 10 feet long, 6 feet wide, and 2 feet high, multiply the three numbers together to get the volume of 120 feet, which is 1.2 cubic meters. This calculation example is like a formula in arithmetic class when I was a child: "Multiply length by width to get the area, and then multiply by height to get the volume." The calculation of cubic meters or square feet on construction sites is based on this sentence.</p>
<p>Steel Bar</p>
<p>(Explanation) Steel bar is the main material for building cement houses. From a structural point of view, steel bar occupies a very important position. It is divided into square, round, and ribbed types, and several names of smooth round. Usually, square ribbed and smooth round are mostly used. Except that smooth round can only be calculated by weighing, square ribbed or round ribbed steel has a fixed weight.</p>
<p>Calculating steel bar (note: square ribbed and round ribbed) to find the weight of each piece in pounds or tons, there is a table on the construction site (note: each piece of steel bar is standardized at 40 feet long), now published on the left.</p>
<p>—Weight of each square ribbed steel bar (calculated per foot)</p>
<p>1 inch — 3.43 equals 102 catties and 14 taels. 7 minutes — 2.64 equals 79 catties and 3 taels. 6 minutes — 1.94 equals 58 catties and 3 taels. 5 minutes — 1.35 equals 40 catties and 2 taels. 4 minutes — ·86 equals 25 catties and 13 taels. 3 minutes — ·49 equals 14 catties and 11 taels. 2 minutes — ·22 equals 6 catties and 9 taels.</p>
<p>—Weight of each round ribbed steel bar (calculated per foot)</p>
<p>1 inch — 2.67 equals 80 catties and 2 taels. 7 minutes — 2.06 equals 61 catties and 3 taels. 6 minutes — 1.52 equals 45 catties and 10 taels. 5 minutes — 1.05 equals 31 catties and 2 taels. 4 minutes — ·66 equals 19 catties and 13 taels. 3 minutes — ·38 equals 11 catties and 6 taels. 2 minutes — ·67 equals 5 catties.</p>
<p>Now that we have this table of the weight (pounds or tons) of each steel bar, it is easy to calculate. The calculation example for steel bar is as follows.</p>
<p>Assuming there are 140 pieces of 3-minute square ribbed steel. (Each piece is 40 feet long) Question: How many tons in total? Method: Multiply the number of 140 pieces by 19.6 pounds (note: this number is the product of 0.49 pounds per foot multiplied by 40 feet long), in this way: 0 pounds, and then multiply the product of 274.4 pounds obtained by 0.75. (Note: This number is the constant number for converting pounds to catties.) If you have already obtained the product of catties, then divide it by 1680 (note: 1680 is the constant number for converting catties to tons), and the result is the tonnage of 140 pieces.</p>
<p>There is also a method of directly calculating tons from pounds, which is to divide by 2240. (Note: 2240 is the invariant number for converting pounds to tons.) You can save the troublesome procedure of 0.75 in the middle, but the construction site strives for details. It is better to use the previous method.</p>
<p>The above are common calculation examples used on construction sites, but construction sites are complex. Of course, the calculation examples are not that simple. Although I have already written the above four types, other methods such as calculating "saw lines," calculating door and window frames, calculating lath, etc. will be written out one by one in the future.</p>
