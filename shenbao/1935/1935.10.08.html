<p>（日內瓦）國聯會六國委員會、業於昨日將致送行政院之報吿書起草完竣、並確定意大利對於阿比西尼亞戰事之責任、十三國委員會頃於本日午前十一時三十分開會討論、治至午後一時、卽將此項報告書全部通過、（七日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<p>（日內瓦）六人委員會已判定意國破壞國聯盟約、其所依據之理由如下、（一）東菲意軍總司令台波諾將軍對其部下發出越過邊界之命令、（二）侵犯阿國十地，（三）轟擊阿狄格拉與阿杜華、六人委員會之報吿書、無項得國聯大會全塲一致或大多數之同意、但投票贊成之各國、皆須均　此後各制裁等之當然辦法、六人委員會之英·法·西班牙·羅馬尼亞·葡萄牙·與智利代表·對此决定、一致同意、昨夜巳將其决議通知行政院理事矣、</p>
<p>侵略國旣已判定、國聯可進行考慮制裁之第二步驟衆料制裁之最後實施、已無可倖免、</p>
<p>迨制裁計畫旣經議定、則將設立一委員會、以管理實施辦法、第一步爲經濟與財政性質之制裁、包括會員國對意斷絕外交關係事、第二步爲對阿軍火接濟禁令之取消、與對意禁絕供給之實施、聞國聯刻正向日德美三國探詢其願否派員以旁聽資格出席於管理制裁實施之委員會會議、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯對意制裁之實施、現幾巳毫無疑義、行政院今晨集議時、修正六人委員會報吿書、另加重要結語一句謂意國不顧國聯盟約第十二條十三條與十五條之條文從事戰爭云、此種判詞至關重要、因盟約第十六條規定任何會員如有不顧本約上述三條所定之規約而從事戰爭者、則應視爲對於國聯全體會員國有戰爭行爲、各會員國須與之斷絕各種商業上與財政上之關係、並用其武力以制此侵略國也、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）本社訪員探悉、行政院本日午後五時舉行會議、討論制裁問題時、不致有所决定、緣制裁實施辦法、須俟國聯會大會星期三日舉行會議指派委員會加以决定戰也、法國總理賴伐爾今晨與該國專家一度會商之後、卽與英國不管部大臣艾登會晤、旋于十一時三十分出席十三國委員會、該委員會當代行政院制定議事日程、卽（一）通過六國委員會報吿書、其結論乃謂、「意大利違反盟約第十二條而開始戰爭」、（按此條規定會員國發生爭議、非俟公斷裁决或法律判决或行政院報吿三個月以後、不得後事于戰爭）、（二）意國總代表阿洛錫對于六國委員會此項結論提出異議、幷由阿國代表加以答辯、（三）行政院主席阿根廷代表格那齊說明制裁手段、乃係六國委員會報吿書所當立卽發生之結果、（四）除意阿兩當事國外、行政院各會員國均得發表意見、六國委員會報吿書必一致通過無疑、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3 id="c2">六國委員會　報吿書內容　共分兩部分 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯會秘書處頃於午後一時五十分公佈六國委員會致送行政院之報吿書、報吿書全文、共分兩部份第一部份、討論意阿兩國是否在戰爭狀態中、第二部份、討論戰爭狀態如成立、則盟約第十一·第十三·第十五各條是否受人侵犯茲摘述要點如下、</p>
<p>第一部份</p>
<p>叙述十月三日戰事開始以來之經過、又分爲五項、（一）東菲洲意屬伊里特里亞軍隊、奉令通過瑪萊勃河Mareb（該河係伊利特里與阿國之天然界綫）郎進入阿國邊境、（二）意國飛機轟炸阿杜華城、（二）意國空軍第十四隊飛過阿國邊境、從事轟炸、　意軍於十月四日、在北路將阿軍擊潰後、卽進抵阿杜華城以北二十公里之地、卽達羅台克爾鎭、幷轟炸沃薩省安巴貝爾克瑪鈸、與南部沃迦登區域戈拉貝鎭、（五）意軍佔據南部多羅城以上各項事實、均經意國公報加以承　、幷在十三國委員會依據盟約第十五條第四項所當送達行政院之報吿書、尙未提付行政院之前、卽巳發生、（按盟約第十五條第四項規定倘爭議不能如此解决、則行政院經全體或多數之表决、應繕發報吿書、說明爭議之事實及行政院所認、公允適當之建議、）</p>
<p>第二部份</p>
<p>亦分爲七項（一）申述盟約第十二·第十三·第十五各條、（二）去年十二月間華爾華爾事件發生之後、意大利政府曾照會行政院、對於阿國所爲、提出抗議、其所根據之事實、較之華爾華爾事伴、尤爲重大、阿國政府、爰乃將華爾華爾事件提付行政院、（三）意國代表曾宣稱、該國保留行動自由、以保護殖民地曁原來享有之利益、幷謂盟約不足以解决爭端、（四）會員國間發生爭議、不得以戰爭解决之、（五）意阿兩國均係凱洛格非戰公約簽字國、　而負有援用和平手段、以解决一切爭端之義務、（六）十月五日阿國政府照會行政院、援引盟約第十六條第一項、謂會員國倘向其地會員國從事戰事、應視爲對於所有全體會員國有戰爭行爲、（七）依照盟約第十六條、全體會員國對於現行爭端、已有考慮制裁辦法之義務、卽使當事國幷未正式宣戰、亦必如是云、六國委員會報吿書最後提出結論云、意大利業巳違反盟約第十二條、開始戰事、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）英國雖已拒絕意相墨索里尼　　交涉之提議、並堅持意阿爭端須由國聯處理、惟今日聞法國外長賴伐爾已重新設法欲使英意兩國妥協、據有力方面消息、上星期杪賴氏　奧浮湼別墅中、　與墨氏互通電話、墨氏頗欲重開一九〇六年修約之英法意三國會義、賴氏目前以爲現在之局勢巳較利於三國交涉、因意軍已佔領阿杜華、墨氏對意國人民已獲得所需要之聲勢、卽使稍爲讓步而停止東菲戰爭、亦可不致失去意國之「顏面」矣云（六日國民電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）阿社華陷落之消息、已在法　發生似是而非的安定人心之影響、羣衆希望意軍旣獲「面子」、墨索里尼可借此收塲、而仍以談判解决意阿爭議、菲迦羅報謂對「綠林法律」之犧牲今巳成功、今宜轉向作對理智法律之犧牲云、小巴黎人報記墨索里尼和緩之電文、依其面值而接受之此將爲吾英友之榮耀云、（七日路透電）</p>
<h3 id="c5">意大利態度轉變　提出媾和條件　法揆賴伐爾斡旋之力　一說意態度依然强硬 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>（日內瓦）意國首席代表阿樂錫爵士今日將公文一件遞交法國代表團、聞內載意國與阿比西尼亞媾相條件、據可靠方面消息、意相墨索里尼準備考慮結束戰事、惟須接受其若干條件、此間得悉、墨氏之態度所以急轉者、大概應歸功於法外長賴伐爾云、（十七日國民電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）今日國聯各界聞意德代表阿洛錫曾訪問法總理賴伐爾提出墨索里尼之新建議消息、大爲興奮、旋探悉兩人會晤僅歷四分鐘、墨氏仍堅持强硬之態度、（七日路透電）</p>

<p>阿京　昨日阿軍在阿杜華陣綫戰敗後、該方面延亘三日之戰車始暫趨沉寂、聞雙方現皆從事調援續戰、意軍將遭遇較阿杜華更員烈之抵抗，天氣轉晴、阿軍調動今可較前大速、現正向三處陣綫、一北部之蒂格里、一東北北之台西，一東南之沃迦登進發，其數達數十萬人、故意軍必經惡戰而勝利、始能續獲進步、今日此間接官報稱、意飛機襲擊阿杜華之際、曾斃婦女四十人、孩童三十二人、（七日路透社電）</p>

<p>阿斯瑪拉　由伊利特里東南攻入阿境之意軍、已佔據沃薩者Aussa之穆薩阿里山、按阿王曾諭令軍隊死守該由、以免吉波蒂至阿京之鐵路爲敵截斷、又意屬索謀里蘭攻阿之大軍、亦佔據沃迦登　之傑洛古比鎭、今距其目的地之哈拉爾僅二百五十哩、南路進步較北路爲易、因地勢不若北路之險阻也、（六日路透電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）東菲意軍作戰之範圍今漸明瞭、北路大軍沿廣六十哩之陣綫與敵接觸、另以一軍多屬菲兵由伊利特里東南攻入阿境、現向西南進撲、冀截斷吉波蒂至阿京之鐵路、該路地勢險惡、作戰非常困難、佔據穆薩阿里山之軍隊、刻向沃薩水草地淮發、而須經過無水之沙漠若干哩、氣溫常高至一百二十度、過此後、沿沃亞斯區河流域而進、可較安易、第三軍由意屬索瑪里倫出勁、現向西北前進、已佔據距目的地哈拉爾二百五十哩之傑洛古比鈸、軍隊前進、皆具戒心尤其爲水源一事、蓋時時有飲毒水之虞也、現每兵日給水二公升每兵一隊隨有驟若干、各馱盛食水之羊皮囊、以防水源頓絕、（七日路透社電）</p>
<p>哈拉阿軍前綫　南路前敵之第一次大戰、或將於二星期內發生、全綫將由沃格登省之叢山中南延而達吉吉格鎭、以現勢觀之、參加戰爭者將有二十五萬人、其中意軍約十萬、餘爲阿軍、阿軍三日來自動退却、放棄邊境各鎭、意軍開到山區之前、當無重接觸、美聯社訪員艾金斯上星期六返至哈拉、卽見全城紛亂異常、一切軍隊已泰令兼稈開往吉吉格、以備大舉抵抗、今日消息、戰爭狂熱已延及英屬索馬里邊境之各部落、當地會長皆大張筵席、以吸引士人攻擊意軍、總之阿比西尼亞皆已出動、（六日國民社電）</p>

<p>阿斯瑪拉　意砲隊猛轟阿杜華時、飛　亦在該城天空拋擲炸彈、旋由坦克車與密集之步隊分兩面進攻、守城之阿軍見力不能抗、乃棄城而走、意軍於今晨十一時三十分入城、髙樹紅綠白三色旗、四十年前所受之恥辱、至是乃雪、（六日路透電）</p>
<p>阿期瑪拉　哈瓦斯社特派員探得阿杜華城攻陷前作戰情形如下、馬拉維格那將軍所率右翼縱隊奉命於是期四日拂曉渡瑪萊勃河、向阿杜華城進攻渡河後前進二十公里、未遭抵抗、星期四日晚前鋒抵達羅泰克爾山道、其地高出海面二千公尺、有阿國哨兵防守、遂發生　觸、至星期五日、開始以砲隊作戰、遂攻陷達羅泰克爾山道、惟距阿杜華城十公里處、尙有喀西亞爾西山道、形勢險要、阿軍負隅固守、鏖戰甚猛、星期六日意軍以飛機猛轟、阿軍二萬五千人所駐守之營帳中彈被毁勢遂不支、至十月六日、右翼縱隊以全力搏擊阿軍七千人、始攻陷阿杜華城、總計是役中、意軍完全賴武器精銳步兵與坦克車聯合進攻、故阿軍雖猛烈抵抗終不克支持、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>阿斯瑪拉　本社訪員特訊、今晨七時起桑的尼將軍所率愆軍左翼縱隊、猛攻喀西亞爾西山道Casc　Siarci　Pass經猛烈肉搏戰後、於上午十時佔領該山道、該處係阿軍最後防守要隘、喀西亞爾西山道攻陷後、意軍左右兩翼遂會合直趨阿杜華城、馬拉維格那將軍所率右翼、於上午十一點三十分首先抵阿杜華郊外、其時阿國賽雄將軍所率部隊猶奮勇抗戰、勢甚猛烈、迨意國援軍繼續馳至、源源不絕、阿軍至最後片刻始將阿杜華城放棄左翼步兵一營首先衝入城內、總計意軍圍攻阿杜華城歷時三書夜、遭猛烈抵抗後、始克攻陷、東菲意國高級委員德波諾將軍預定目標、可謂已完全達到、惟是役中雙方損失甚大、意軍進城後、阿比西尼亞人猶匿居街旁住宅內、向意軍開槍、當塲擊斃甚多、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）據此間所得消息、意軍先頭部隊進阿杜華城後、意軍第二軍團復遭阿軍猛烈反攻、後經大隊援軍馳至、始將阿軍繫退、因此延至數小時、意軍始克完全佔領阿杜華城、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）據此間接電阿杜華之役、阿人死者約達二千、此數猶爲頗低之佔計云、意軍傷亡之數並無報吿、惟信不逮阿方遠甚、墨索里尼之婿齊亞諾伯爵所率領之大轟炸機、此役最爲得力、其親自駕駛之飛機、炸彈盡後、乃降低盤旋阿杜華城上、以機關槍掃射阿軍、有時轟炸全城之飛機、同時竟達二十四架之多云、（六日國民電）</p>
<p>阿京　此問今日得報、意軍飛機十六架曾轟炸華爾凱脫地方之村　、並以機關槍掃射、傷者六人傑洛古比鎭今晨亦受轟炸、死四十五人、髙拉喜村則受第二次轟炸、惟因該處沙土鬆軟、投下炸彈多未爆發、按上述之三次攻擊、死亡人數特少、蓋阿軍已遵照命令、避免正面交戰、故已預先退出、以俟意軍之深入、（七日國民電）</p>

<p>— 同</p>
<p>復旦大學新聞學系。昨乘慶祝三十週紀念之機會。舉行世界報展覽會。徵集國內報紙。達一千二百餘份。十八省·八市·遠及邊疆各地出版之報紙。幾無不參加。此外復有各報珍貴之合訂本。二百本有歷史價値之特殊品五十　。國外報紙參　者包括歐美亞澳非五洲。內獨立國二六殖民地十二。共三十八單位。中外各印刷機器工廠送會陳列各種印刷機。械本報與新時兩報亦送會陳列電要圖表各若干。集中外關於報紙之陳列品於一室。琳瑯滿目。誠關於新聞事業深有興味之展覽會也。</p>
<p>世界新聞　業之發達。不過近百年　。近代工商業之特殊猛進。使人類生活及社會組織頓改舊觀。而傳達思想與溝通社會組織重要工具之報紙。亦因之與日俱進。致有今日之盛。國新聞事業。近年來雖不無進步。然與同時代各大國報紙比較觀之。似尙不能脫離貧弱狀態。日銷數百萬份。在國外爲常見。在我國則絕無。他若通訊網之布置。一切物質上之供給與享用。亦遠不如人。此次復大報展足使吾人自知所短。力求改　之道。其意義實大焉。</p>
<p>雖然。我國新聞事業。欲與先進諸國並駕齊驅。非僅報業本身之努力所能爲功也。蓋新聞事業之進步。繫於社會文化各方面之發達。而工商業之降盛。交通之繁密。國民程度之提髙。民主精神之發揚。尤爲促進新聞事業之要素。返觀我國。則尙缺乏此等條　。故如何以謀我國新聞事業之發展。實各界人士所應共同策勵者也。</p>

<p>— 本報特派員紀元</p>
<p>漢口居長江和漢水的左岸、全市人口約有八十萬左右、一向有「九省通衢」以及「東方的芝加哥」之雅號、其實九省通衢、差不多已成了過去的名詞、因交通事業的發達、自西而東的貨物輸出、可由隴海路或長江直抵上海、南可經廣州出口、並不像從前一樣、西部西北部以及西南部各省出口的物品、均須以漢口爲唯一之集散地、至於「東方的芝加哥」似乎也有些誇大、別的不說、卽就武漢區僅有的工業紗廠業而論全區四家中　門的巳有三家、碩果僅存的一家、也奄奄一息了、漢市社會情形、據調査所得、無論商業·金融·人民生活·各方面、均形困難之狀、漢市銀行、計有二十餘家錢莊原有七八十家、最近只賸六十四家、尙在逐漸减退中、比年以來、銀行和錢莊的任務、並不在調劑金融和流通資金、而是集中現欵、收回欠債、更可怪的、却是現欵無從集中、欠債無法收回、信用凍結、巳到了很髙的程度、銀行呑併錢莊的現象、活像大魚吃小魚一樣、素來以錢莊業爲漢　金融組織某礎的勢力、巳宣吿瓦解、據熟悉金融業情形者稱、本年六月底、漢口最大的　裕錢莊、因通商銀行的壓迫過甚而宣吿清　、便是最明顯的　實、目下許多情形較佳的小錢莊、均有自動休業之意、（漢口錢莊資本最少僅三千元、最多亦不到十萬元、）</p>
<p>商業方面、商店的關門數目、固然不少、且無論那一項營業、都有一年以內三易其老闆的現象、而以廣貨商號為尤甚、頂替做老闆的、大半多是債權人或者資本較雄厚·計劃較遠大的店主、漢口市面有句最流行的話、就是「只見店員、不見顧客、」然亦有許多商店、求關門而不得者、金融界對於各商戶的欠債、也不敢過事壓迫、深恐一旦形成總倒閉風潮、各商店均宣告淸理、自己亦難免虧累、可是又小敢再貸與資金、以自討苦吃、於是規模較大的商店、就進退兩難了、事實旣然如此、所以宣吿關門的商店、一天天的增多、　最近的總計、全市有二三十家廣貨店、已貼上「店面生財召盤」的字樣、全市南京帮雜貨店二十家中、關門的已有十六家、沿中山路一帶爲漢口最熱鬧的市區、空店屋的亦如不少、</p>
<p>一般商業、雖然日見衰退、而洋貨銷路、則有蒸蒸日上的趨勢、其中尤以日貨爲最、據漢口商業月刋李君談、漢口是外貨傾銷的大本營、約占全市貿易額中十分之九國貨貿易、僅佔十分之一、外貨又分日貨·與歐美貨·二類、其比率爲日貸六而歐美貨四、日貨全年貿易價値約在三千萬元以上、此數目尙在增加中、日貨輸漢、以疋頭·棉紗·兩項爲大宗、海味藥材等次之、漢口紗廠業所以一蹶不振、日紗布的傾銷、實爲致命傷云云、自前漢口有幾種特殊現象、第一是商店越大、虧累越多、反之、小本經營、倒可苟延殘喘、第二、大菜館如杏花樓等、均巳關門、而經濟菜館、反見增加、經濟兩字、遂成爲時髦口頭禪、第三、勞動力很多過剩、無處可賣、尤以中下階層市民爲甚、</p>
<p>漢口的地產事業、在民國二十年大水災以前、還在鼎盛時代、銀行營業、外商如義品銀行、華商如上海銀行等、差不多全致力於地產事業之經營、其贏利比放欵勝過數倍、現在的情形、則大大不然、地產事業疲敝已極、往往有一述幾座的房子、無人過問、一個三樓三底的二房東、項得自己付全部房租、在民二十以前、二房東欠房主房租三個月、房主如向法院控吿、法院例頒嚴令限期繳淸、否則拘懲不貸、現則房租積欠、有的竟達二十八個月之多、地方法院、關於呈請追繳房租的案件、已堆積有一千八百餘件之數、法院殊苦無法處置、只得暫行束之高閣、從長計議、</p>
<p>本年大水災以後、社會情形、全省嗷嗷待哺的災民、達七百餘萬武漢當局、對災民入市、取締綦嚴、故災民無法居留武漢、（民二十大水災時、武漢三鎭尙容留災民三十萬、近則一二千人而已、）但若輩多麕集武漢近地、或過其結隊逃荒生活、仍間接影饗武漢的商業和治安武漢當局、因此頗　憂慮、對於救濟方面也有杯水車薪無濟於事之苦、不久以前、漢市曾舉行賑濟水災募捐運動大會、但募集所得、爲數不到四萬元、若與民二十年募捐的成績四十餘萬元相比擬、足見社會經濟之日益支絀了、</p>

<p>你的工作就是你的生命石像。它之爲美醜，爲可愛，爲可憎，全操於你自己之手。</p>
<p>有一個著名的科學家說，當他遭遇到一個似乎不可超越的難題時，他知道，自己是快要有新的發明了。</p>
<h3 id="c156">謔疾季 <a href="#c156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>夏之間，瘧疾流行，所以這個時期，人們都叫它做「瘧疾季」。這病是因患者被一種蚊蟲—卽雌瘧蚊—所刺吮而起，證實還不過五十多年。以前是：大家都把這病當做一種瘴疫，以爲它是從汚濁的空氣中傳來；尤其是在沼澤等處，更易發生這種疾患。</p>
<p>第一個蹬明雌瘧蚊爲害於人類的，是一位法國軍醫勞凡朗少佐。時在西元一八八〇年。那年他在北非洲服務，常在瘧疾患者的病血中，借顯微鏡之力，發見寄生蟲。在西元一八九八年，又有一位英國軍醫少佐陸那陸斯爵士，在印度發見雌瘧蚊體中亦有同樣的寄生蟲，這兩位少佐都是我們的恩主，永遠値得紀念的。</p>
<p>瘧疾旣已有人初步證明是雌瘧蚊爲害；於是有科學家出而再加實地試騐了。在意大利國地伯爾河東，有一塊大平野，其他向被人目爲可怖的瘧疾區。有兩位科學家在瘧疾季裏，便親到該處，與病者爲伍。他們造了一所房子，開以網眼紗窗，夜卽住在其中。在日間，他們自然和病者相接觸；並且還在河旁洗澡；夜間呢，則讓那沼澤畔的空氣透入紗窗中來。這樣，患瘧疾者雖日包圍着他們，而兩位科學家依舊健康如故。這是證明欲免瘧疾，惟有不被雌瘧蚊刺吮的一個實例。</p>
<p>還有兩位英國倫敦醫生獻給其身供那瘧蚊刺吮的事。這蚊曾刺吮過意國病者，把它們裝在小木箱內運送到倫敦的。被刺之後，過了十八天，兩位醫生即同發瘧疾。在他們血中，並騐得有寄生蟲。療治他們的醫生則均無恙，這證明瘧疾不是經空氣傳染的。</p>
<p>現在可怖的「瘧疾季」已來臨了，快設法撲滅那蚊蟲吧，尤其是見到那種蚊蟲棲息時，兩隻後腿髙高蹺起，身體向上的：這就是瘧蚊！</p>
<h3 id="c157">過街樓主小傳 <a href="#c157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— 一震</p>
<p>過街樓主是一位同居的別號，他實足是個無名作家而且是失業者，每月靠着幾張小報的稿費來維持自己生活，可是他又是「浪漫派」，酒和烟的耗費很是利害，所以弄得十天中總有四天挨餓的。生活雖然艱難，變愛却不能不談，他曾先後鍾情於一個女招待，房東的女僕，而現在又和房東的小姨鬧得火熱。據說房東太太的母親就是小姨的母親，小姨的父親又不是房東太太的父親。最近他贈給愛人一段衣料一瓶香水一束花綫，贈辭是「還有一段衣料一瓶香水一束花綫留給我自己用了」。</p>
<p>他的筆名是「過街樓主」，有時也用什麽英珍秀華等名字來代替，所以他的來信中除了有顧××先生收外，還有顧秀×或顧×珍女士展的信寄給他。</p>
<p>他曾發明「男子的乳房和老鼠的鬍鬚一樣沒用論」。爲同居所贊服，有人問他自己和男子的乳房及老鼠的鬍鬚比較怎樣？他却無言了。</p>

<h3 id="c159">我國理髮所前的圓柱考 <a href="#c159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— 永采</p>
<p>關於理髮所所前圓柱的由來，在歐西各國，或者誠如顧君等所述，確爲普法戰爭時所嚆矢。但在我國，則此中實另有一段裨史般的情節在。茲特不憚瑣屑，筆之本刋，以供研討。</p>
<p>當明太祖朱洪武初平天下，定鼎江寗時，因各地民氣囂張，未能翕服，疑忌極深。御位後，卽敕派某大將輪迴巡狩，藉資鎭懾。某大將幕中，有一善於望氣者，追隨某大將至句容縣時，忽密吿城中王氣甚旺，將有覇主者出，某大將大駭，一面專摺入奏，一面卽妥商禳解之法。結果，就實施了一條愚民政策！。禁止句民讀書，弗與科舉。遂使有明一代，句容的賢才埋沒，無一顯貴。然在當時，句民因無故仕途被削，都極忿忿不平，有司恐激成事變，倉皇入吿，太祖爲消靡句人怨忿起見，就下詔特許句人專理理髮，修脚，竹工三業，並准理髮業得在店前豎立旗杆，以示榮典。於是，凡屬句容人所開設的理髮所前，都豎着含有光榮性的巍巍然矗立的旗杆了。現在，旗杆雖因朝代屢次的變遷而沒有了。但是門首的圓柱，却仍舊是旗杆所蛻化而成的一個縮影。</p>
<p>據說！北平的理髮擔上，在面盆旁，仍有一根旗杆式的木杆翹然獨立，這就是一個顯明的證據。還有，句容人的專營理髮一業，現在仍有這般風氣，這也是件確鑿的事實。</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>可是我來了這幾天，却不見浴室在那裏呢？」我向伊請問着。</p>
<p>「什麽？你說的是什麽話啊？」那女官似乎很駭愕地向我反問道：「浴室！什麽是浴室啊！你的話我眞聽不明白！」</p>
<p>我原是要向伊請敎的，現在却變爲伊來向我請敎了。於是我就竭力的給伊解釋浴室是什麽意義，然而伊還是不很明白，因爲那時候的人根本不考究這些，要洗操祇須一只木盆便完了，根本沒有另闢浴室的需要，伊當然難以瞭解了。</p>
<p>「旣然這裏沒有浴室的設備，那末，」我想我和我妹妹是逼不得已才勉强弄一只木盆用用的，太后旣是那樣尊貴的人，又是久居在宮內的，怎麼會不弄一間浴室呢？因又忍不住問道：「老佛爺又是怎樣的洗法呢？」</p>
<p>「要問這個，你且自巳去用眸子瞧吧！」那女官彷彿很不耐煩和我多說話，立卽駁斥道：「停一會你少不得就要進去侍候了，現在這樣空着急是什麽意思呢？……好歹總不用你操心……！」</p>
<p>我給伊如此一搶白，自亦不願再多問了，便懷着這疑團耐心等候。</p>
<p>每逢晚膳過後，太后總得召集了我們這些近侍坐在伊的那一間便殿內隨便談論着，——當然發話的總是伊老人家自已，我們都只悄悄地聽着。所談論的無非是當天一天內發生的種種事件，或宮內外各位大臣的人品；約莫總須談　　小時左右，然後伊才肯退回伊的寢宮中去，別人也方人也方始可以散開。（四三二）</p>

<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>失業的黑潮，已經泛濫到世界的任何一角。印度加爾各搭的準備銀行，最近募集臨時行員八十人，而志願者已超過一萬。在開始面會談話這犬，一萬餘人，羣集銀行門外，交通斷絕，準備銀行竞因此而暫停營業。倘若每人以一分鐘爲談話時間，晝夜和志願者談話，亦至少需要七大。銀行方面，因爲有碍營業，只好宣佈無期延期。於是失業者騷動起來，後來大動干戈，請了騎巡隊軍隊出來驅散羣衆，才能開始營業，然已損失不資了。</p>
<p>塞爾維亞國內，有名維利米爾的老者，原來是一個很滑稽的樂天派。三年前在耶蘇聖　節那夜忽然大哭起來之後，一天到晚睡覺。除了人家給敬他吃飯之外，永久睡眠不醒。去年十月國王亞歷山大被刺，家人乘着老人吃飯的時候，把國王駕崩的話，講給他聽。那知他聽了之後，哭病復　，一邊哭一邊走到國王的墓所，計哭四日十二小時，然後回家即陲。這次醒來之後，行動照常，仍舊是個樂天派了。此種疾病，雖著名醫家，也不能回答出所以然來。</p>
<p>在電影裏時常看見兩個人打架，一個人拿着一只凳子，打在人家頭上，凳脚也折斷了。倘然這隻凳子和普通一樣的話，那末被打者雖不致死，至少也要重傷，其實此種凳子的木材，名「巴爾塞」，是一種軟木，一立方〇僅重三磅，木質柔軟，用牙齒也咬得斷的，所以打在頭上，絕對不會受傷。該木產於南美洲低涇地方，自從電影裏需要之後，價値陡然增加起來了。</p>
<p>最近美國泰晤時報上發現一則異想天開的廣吿是新開「每天愛犬散步公司」。先是有奇米台利者，是某公寓的監督人。在公寓裏寄宿的婦女們，常要託他將自己的愛犬帶着一同出去散步。每天早晚，他竟成了愛犬散步的監護者了。因此他忽發奇想，開了這爿空前的新公司。定章每日散步一次，月金五元，每日兩次八元，三次十二元，星期日監護者休息。該公司創設以後，營業繁盛，出於意料。請了許多助手，每天陪着人家的愛犬出去散步，到現在已有一萬頭以上了。</p>
<p>今年三月二十五日法國巴黎舉行古董競買會，內中有一張凡爾塞平和條約的原稿，亦在拍賣之列。該稿爲歐洲大戰結束的成績品，去今雖僅十五年因爲有歷史價値，所以價値抬髙至四萬五千法郎。該原稿爲昨冬被晤殺的白爾次外相所藏，亦他的書架上發現的有許多名將統領的簽字。</p>
<p>米國芝加哥有喬治樸克來脫業商業美術和商品裝飾，年四十九歲。最近到當地弗朗克博士的病院裏去醫治一種寄怪病症。他在數年之前，生了莫名其妙的病，身體軀壳漸漸的變成猴子的樣子。大掌瘦腕，屈腰曲足。並且尻部發痛，不久竟生出一條尾巴來了。經博士診斷結果，說是粘液腺和甲狀腺異樣分泌的關係，是否能恢復做人，尙不能確定。</p>
<p>日本人的姓，種類不多，名字又喜歡用大郎二郎三郎，所以同名同姓的人很多。最奇怪的要算茨城縣的磯濱町了。姓「關根」兩字的有四百　十戶，佔居全數的四分之一。內中同姓名的非常之多，並且有四五人相同的。那裏的郵差，任你有記憶，天才，也無法可想。於是該地常局通知住戶，以後養了小孩，所取的名字，不得和四百二十戶中任何人同名，以免混亂。但人民的姓氏，而由官廳規定，亦空前未見的奇事。</p>

<p>他不但是知道將嘴就着水喝，而且還抬起一隻手來，伸着一個彎曲的指頭，向小西天的後門指點着。不用猜，知道他的意思，是戀着這裏面的孫女見，至少他的意志是很淸楚的。在這樣的情形下，想着他是不會血口噴人的，於是慢慢的走近前來，背了兩手，向他們遙遙的望着。那胡嫂子猛然一抬頭，看　這邊有個人望着，却吃了一　　樣子，他道：有人出來了。那位老太太隨着他這話點了兩點頭，那隻枯瘦的手，還是還顫巍巍的，向這邊指點着。李士廉想，他們不是要訛詐我嗎？想到了這裏，立刻臉上靑一陣紅一陣，心裏也隨着亂跳。遠遠的看到那位老太太嘴唇皮，有些開合不定，似乎在說着什麽似的。胡嫂子這就先向李士　看看，然後對老太太道：這位是李老爺，並不是賈老爺，他是賈老爺的朋友。於是這老太太將那凹下去很深的眼睛，睜得很大的，向士廉望着。那是不用說的，他對於這後門裏面，還帶有很濃厚的希望。胡嫂子，就丢開了他，迎上前來，向他苦笑道：李老爺，你看看，我們這位親戚，實在是想孫女兒想的不得了，就是不讓他回來，那怕讓我那外甥女在這後門口站上一站呢。你和賈老爺是很好的朋友，你若是肯去對他講個情，也許是可以做到的。（三三五）</p>

<p>— 美國奧爾珂德女士原著鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>「他是我們從來惟一失敗的童子，我心裏眞難過，我原以爲他幾有許多錯誤，他的本質還可以使他成就一個好人的。」</p>
<p>唐恩聽到裴夫人嘆息，他自己也想請求再給他一次機會，可是他的豪氣又不讓他去做，他於是就走了出來，臉上還是漠然無動的神情，但一握手默然不發一語，即和裴先生同乘而去，却只讓乃德與蜀夫人舍淚相送，佇立悵望而已。</p>
<p>幾天以後他們接到貝先生的信，報道唐恩情形佳好，他們聽　，自是不勝欣喜。可是三星期以後又來一封信，說唐恩已經跑掉了，並且消息沉沉，不知下落，他們聽了，又都面有憂色，於是裴九生說道：</p>
<p>「也許那時我還應該給他一個機會的。」</p>
<p>不過這一裴夫人倒是點着頭，像是很有見識的樣子，說道：「不要悔恨，　力悔恨，孩子是會歸來的，這是我很有把握的事。」</p>
<p>可是日子一天一天過去，唐恩呢，却連影兒也不兌一個。</p>

<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>昨天翻看黄遠生遺著，在懺悔錄見到這樣一段記載：</p>
<p>『余爲南潯公學學生時，……此時學生，正講革命自由民權種種。余輩羨慕南洋公學學生鬧學之風潮，爲報紙所贊議；旣　電賀之，文曰：「南潯公學全體學生，恭賀南洋公學同學全體脫離專制學校之苦。」大書特書，登之中外日報。又以小故，與學校尋鬧，全體罷學，以余爲代表。罷學後，同學或赴海上而嬉，或卽赴南洋公學投考。此時公學完全官辦，余卽投考之一人，昔日電賀他人之脫離專制；今乃自己脫去自由之校，而欲求專制之校，且不可得；無主義，無理想，無節操，自余少時蓋已然矣。</p>
<p>此時學生風氣，以罷學爲一大功名；自南洋公學發起後，窮鄉僻壤，皆受影響。蔓延及於海外，日本留學生之罷學者，年必數起，最後以留學生，取締風潮爲歸宿，取締風潮，實以胡漢民主之最力，意欲借爲革命機會：汪精衛力持不可，組織維持會以抗之。由今思之，革命者亦卽罷學風潮之放大影片而已。』</p>
<p>這段記載也是不中看的，他把淸末學生運動的瘡疤暴露得太明顯了。但做學生代表的人，何以會那麽「無主義，無理想，無節操」呢？其故大　深思；那便是我要寫「五四的霉菌那段雜感的　因。我覺得知識分子最靠不住，固然善於義憤塡膺，同時也最會賣身投靠。梁啟超推許楊度爲最有血性的靑年，而　袁世凱上皇帝寳座的就是他；在上海做愛國運動領袖的趙欣伯，他現在在那兒做第一號漢奸；如黃遠生所自述，他自己做學生代表，自己先去投考所謂「專制的南洋公學。知識分子的遊離意識最可怕的，把五四運動的學生代表，當作純潔的社會運動者來描寫，那是最危險的；知識分子自己會忘記自己沒落的暗影，而一般人也會把什麽運動都交托知識分子去領導。還是那句老話不錯：秀才造反，三年不成。」學生代表肯自始至終爲社會服務，眞太少了！我覺得我們自己應該如黄遠生那樣自己認錯，自己暴露自己的惡性梅毒，不要用好聽的詞語來掩飾！黄遠生又說：</p>
<p>「吾於科學時代，絕無作官思想。至爲留學生將畢業時，則謀生之念，與所謂愛國之念交迫於中。自此以往，乃　然理欲交戰之時期，理不勝欲，故以墮落：欲又不勝理，故以苦痛；愈苦痛則愈墮洛，愈墮落則愈苦痛，二者循環相生，擾擾不絕。……毒藥之毒，封豕長蛇之凶，然猶不及中國官界；蓋戕賊人才，此爲一利劑；無恥下流愚闇腐敗種種，莫不由此醞釀增多，蓋萬惡之養成所也。……革命之後，黨會紛立，余之所最感慨者，卽在此時期中買賣人口之風盛行。全國之間等流氓，乃等於挿標入市之猪牛，小者賣其皮肉，甚者乃至毛骨不留。女閶三百之中，姿首可人者固亦有之，乃至黃臉婆子，鳩面鬱荼，亦復價値萬錢，利市三倍。譬猶肉市騰湧，雖瘟猪病牛，亦復不脛而走，蓋數年以來，人格掃地盡矣」。</p>
<p>——懺悔錄（民國四年東方雜誌）</p>
<p>他的「慨乎言之」，於我心有戚戚焉。周亮工記阮大鉞的家優李某『　寗死，優兒散於他室，李優者，但有客命爲懷寗所撰諸劇，輒辭不能；復約其同輩勿　演。詢其故？曰：「阿翁姓字不觸起，尙免不得人說：每一演其撰劇，座客笑駡百端，使人懊惱竟日，不如辭以不能爲善也。』阮大鉞曲事魏忠賢，做魏　的乾兒義父，可算明末文人中最無恥的一個。一個大文豪的出處，尙不及一個伶工的光明磊落；大家且想想由知識分子來領導社會運動，那運動會有好的結局嗎？</p>

<p>— 孟華</p>
<p>自從離開那擁擠着旅客們（這些可說完全是在國內求生不得的回胞）的甲板之後，我無時不在昏暈與憤恨的情形下。異邦的生疏，白色人種的虐待，赤道的太陽，以及抑鬱的心情眞把我苦够了，一直等到我離開西貢，才釋了重負一樣的出了一口兀積的悶氣。</p>
<p>這一回，經了住在西貢的朋友們的帮忙，好容易地才找到一個一起到宅郡去的同伴。他是一位老番客，從十一歲就到暹羅，再由暹羅轉到爪哇，十一年前他才到安南來，看着他那斑白的鬚鬢，我猜他定是四十開外的人了。有這樣一個同伴實在好了許多，我們在路上談着一些又像傳奇，又像冒險小說，更像人猿泰由之類的故事。因爲他初到暹羅，那里還可說是洪荒世界，所以那些到由巴內去的人，誰都是以生命作發財的注的。而他亦是一個勇敢地下過生命的注的人。道老人說時候不斷搖頭？似不勝感慨的樣子。這亦是難免的，奔走了三幾十年，別人已楚團團富家翁了，而他還是只有一隻竹籃，一條圍巾而已。據他自己說，是因賭傾家的，那麽他至少亦是發過財的人了。</p>
<p>我不會忘記到了宅郡的那天晚上，熱帶的晚霞實在更　絢爛。我見過黄河的落日，泰山的夕照同太湖的斜陽，但這里却完全異樣。黄河的是悲壯，泰山的是又遠又闊，可看見西邊又遠又低的的雲彩，亦可以望見東方的陰暗，是一個壯火的陪襯；太湖却是遼廓的水上浮着一抹五色紛披的雲彩，是以悠遠遠與嫵媚動人，但這里除開參天的樹木，椰林，是熱烈而又空曠外，還有一種使人悶壓的氣氛。</p>
<p>隔天四點多鐘，我就混在陌生的隊伍裏起程來　椥。　椥稱安南六省之一，實不過一村間的市鎭，因此周圍亦格外淸爽，較之西貢等不乏另一種風味。到校之後，我卻喜歡坐在門口，在那里可以望見對岸的椰林，靑天和白雲。黄昏時候，星兒　尖一樣，小得令人看　慣，亦鏙燦得令人看不慣。眞的，我已經到了一個十分異樣的地方了。</p>

<p>— 林石</p>
<p>早春的山上，樹枝有的還是光秃秃的，有的茁了綠葉，有的是不落葉的，看上去還是暗綠色，祇是不像夏天那般黑油油的。杜鵑花還不曾開，不過也結了小小的蓓蕾。嬌嫩的草上，牠的蹄踏上去，也覺得軟柔柔，雖然不如夏天的那樣有如舖了大幅的厚毡。唯有自由自在飛躍在林中的小鳥們，却提髙嗓子呌得十分起勁。</p>
<p>在樹林中走來走去，主人始終不肯跨下牠的背來。那隻灰毛狗，却尖着鼻在小樹叢中鑽進鑽出，想嗅出兎子或其他野獸的氣味。不久，那隻狗一面嗅着地上向前走，一面精神質的　呸的吠，主人懂得這是發覺了野獸的氣味。於是主人指揮着牠跟在狗的後面走去。走着，走着，從這邊山凹轉過那邊的山凹。果然，狗搜尋着一隻兎子了。兎子拚命向前逃命，狗便在後面緊緊的追着。這時主人喜得渾身的肌肉都緊張着，好像看見一團的大金塊在前面滾着，滾着，快要落下大海中去一般，無論如何得像射箭一般快的飛過去拾將起來，否則他的財富便會失去，永遠是舞影無踪。主人在牠背上抽了一鞭，火辣練的十分難受。於是牠不得不快速度的跟着狗跑過去，遠遠的望着那兎子在速躍帶跑的慌張的逃命。忽然牠耳邊一聲槍響，牠不禁嚇得一跳，只見那兎子便應聲而倒，在草叢中倒下微微的動顫着。接着狗便敏捷的跑過去啣將起來，精神抖索的送到到主人面前，喉間還唔唔的呌着，祇有兎子的鮮紅的血，却一滴一滴的落在地下，將綠草染得殷紅</p>
<p>馬給這殘酷的一刹那嚇得渾身發冷，其後便呆呆的望着閉上了眼睛，一動也不動的屍體，以及那草上凝結着的鮮血。牠想：這兎子在不久以前，牠是在山林中自由的來往。牠不侵犯誰，牠不　不饗的在生活着，餓了的時候　吃着小草和嫩葉罷了。也許在那個石洞裏，牠也會有牠的家，也許牠還有新生的孩子在等着牠的歸去。但是啊，當牠未遭遇這災難之前，牠　也不會想到不久之後便得死去，而且牠是不願意死去的啊！那末牠　什麼要死呢？難道牠僅僅是不聲不饗的生活着也犯了死罪麽？誰又要宣判牠的死刑呢？哦！主人是多麽貪妄，又是多麽野蠻和殘忍喲！但是牠實在想不透：那隻狗爲什麽也如此殘忍呢？假使說人類的主人是殘酷的話，那末狗不也是並非人類麽？其後牠又想：對於這兎子無辜的死，自己也不是毫無罪過的，雖然不是自己開槍，也不是自已尋覓着牠的踪迹，但是假使當時忍受着主人的鞭撻，並不跑得那般快，也許那粒子彈是打不中兎的身體的罷，也許牠還有機會逃回家裏去，和等候着牠的孩子們相見。——這種自我譴責，使馬兎十分難受，牠似乎看見那兎子圓睜着憤怒的眼睛在向牠索命似的。牠恐怖的低下頭去，又望見了那草上的鮮血，一股濃重的腥味刺着牠鼻的深處，於是牠緊緊的閉上眼皮，像要暈蹶過去似的。</p>
<p>一會兒馬聽見主人在哈哈大笑，髙興得什麼似的，顯然，死屍和鮮血，對於他並無任何感動。接着他對着狗大聲說：</p>
<p>「好，我們再來一個罷。兎肉鮮得很，拿回去，我有吃，我也給你吃。」</p>
<p>果然，只見那隻狗又吠了兩聲，興高采烈的向草叢中鑽去，牠又去給主人獻功了。可是不久之後，當狗又尋着了兎子的時候，馬立刻想到；也許這便是剛才遭難了的兒子，牠是出來尋找牠還沒有回去的母親吧，難道又要眼看着牠跟在母親之後，給猙獰的主人殘殺麼？不，我一定不使牠如此，儘我的力量，一定得保存牠目由的生命。——於是當主人又鞭撻着　牠追上前去的時候，牠爲正義而憤怒着，牠咆哮着，猛躍着，用盡了生平全部的氣力，將主人從自己的背上翻了下來，跌在地上。而且跑上前去，追上那隻狗，使勁的將狗踏在地下，怎麽樣也爬不起來，讓那隻可憐的兎子能够逃去，逃到很遠的地方，逃到牠石洞的家裏去。</p>
<p>這一來，當然使主人十分憤怒，當牠被主人强拉着回到家裏的時候，牠的身上已被打得　地創傷，流血，像那死兎子流出來的一樣。牠飢渴着，主人不給牠水喝，也不給牠稻草吃。餓了許久，牠想到那亁稻草多麼好滋味哦。</p>
<p>從廊下望進去，看見主人用白布包着頭——那是給牠跌傷了的在在嚼兎肉，吃得滿嘴是油的極有滋味。</p>
<p>深夜，馬被緊縛在馬廄裏。仍然是沒有一粒水也沒有一根草。牠疲倦了，但也疲倦的思索。日間的一切，在牠心頭淸楚的回憶着。主人從來對於牠刻毒的待遇，更不會使牠忘記。這眞是太明顯了：牠一生一世給主人忠心服役，可是所得着報酬却是無休止的鞭打。無論如何，這小小的馬廄，不是牠安身的所在，同時牠再也不甘屈服在皮鞭之下討幾根革吃</p>
<p>夜間是如此靜寂，聽不到一點聲音，像是古墓中一樣。周圍的黑暗，緊緊的包裏着牠，連自由呼吸的可能也沒有了。不過牠確信，自己雖是年老了，但總還要生活下去。牠懷想着山林中的天地是那麼寬大，牠懷想着春天的太陽是那麽光輝，牠懷想着田野間的靑草是那麽嫩肥，牠懷想着森林中的空氣是那麽流暢。於是牠嚙着縛住自己的頭顱的繩索，牠的呼吸促迫着。</p>
<p>許久，堅縛着的繩索終於斷了。從小窗戶中望出去，此時的天色已經微明。老馬使力的衝破了馬廐的板壁，又　破了庭院的竹籬。牠從來沒如此興奮過。牠忘記了渴，也忘記了餓。牠全身是勁的呼嘯着，大聲呼嘯着，震破了死寂的天空。在晨光曦微中，牠跳躍涪向森林中奔去。</p>

<p>兒子給鎭上的人們祝賀着，受到熱鬧的歡送，實行入伍了了——我們家鄉的人們，是要跑到鄰近的地力去入伍的。老婆婆就非常喧鬧地嚷着，眼淚汪汪地跟着兒子跑了兩里左右的路。</p>
<p>如今，她家裏只是　下老婆婆自已和她的丈夫兩個人了。丈夫因爲患了羊角瘋這毛病，十年來都跟廢人一般地躺在牀上。</p>
<p>對於這給纒綿的痼疾　得脾氣很大的，麻煩的丈夫，老婆婆的忠節，從來就很是有名。不但是這樣。而且這　是老婆婆的一種很人的誇耀。我們不曉得她是不是心愛着她的丈夫。不過，至少她是從　底裏感　做妻子的義務，這却是事實。在實際上，十年間决不是個短促的時日。這其間，她　方面到我　裏夾做活，方面就把只有一早一晚的休息時間全部化在病人的看護和照料上面。並日，她　然時常把自己的忠節很自負地說着；但却毫無怨言。頗爲　得這　情形　我的母親，因此　常　稱讚她。這時候，她就從心裏覺到快慰，感謝得連眼淚　斷地流下來。</p>
<p>雖然有這麽句話：「女人　廢物；但同時也是因爲人免有愛別緻的傢伙。有一天晚上，一個　我家工廠裏做工的年輕人，居然向着老婆婆　調起來了。也許她並沒有生氣，第二天早上就連忙跑到我的母親跟　來，把那年輕人的不　行　一五一十地告訴她。</p>
<p>「無論是個怎樣不中用的病人；但丈夫到底還是丈夫。我也是個堂堂正正地有着丈夫的人啦。——這麽說着，我　對那傢伙嚷了起來，可不是嗎，太太！」</p>
<p>「當然，　然，你　是個値得欽佩的人物。我也　把傢伙呌來，好好地說他一頓。」好容辱母親才把她　回去。</p>

<h3 id="c222">門戶的爭取 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>世界列強來所爭是什麼呢？一言以蔽之，卽殖民地與半殖民地的門戶哩。原來帝國主義因生產過剩的結果，要解決其本國的經濟問題，便只有向外發展的一途。於是殖民地與半殖民地的門戶，遂成爲它們的必爭之地。而世界也就因此事而多事了。</p>
<p>華聯東京一日電：日本外務省，現積極準備打開英日外交之沉悶狀態，英國經濟專家羅斯爵士赴日時，已與廣田外相，作種種之懇談，由倫敦歸國之松平大使及商務參事官松山氏，亦與廣田外相作最後協議，决定向英要求開放英國殖民地之門戶，允許日本商務之發展，並擬向英國聲明，如英國不能開放其世界之門戶，則請今後勿再高呼東亞門戶開放之論調，且惟有允許日本向英屬地移入，始可在世界實行英日恊調云。</p>
<p>這是英日之爭。英國所爭的是東亞門戶，日本所爭的是英殖民地門戶。東亞門戶，原是開放的。自九一八而後，英國漸有被按戶外之勢，故殊不能默然。至若英殖民地的門戶，邇來日本曾以傾銷政策侵入。但終因英國的擋駕，大受打擊。因是日本便利用英國欲圖恢復其在遠東權益的時會，向其要求開放屬地門戶，作爲交換的代價。今後英日恊調是否能成功，當視兩國市塲之爭，能否覓得妥恊的途徑爲轉移。</p>
<p>又據哈瓦斯倫敦一日電：國際婦女和平自由同盟會美國分會，昨晚在此問康威堂舉行會議，都荷色德茨爾女士發表演說云，美國新軍艦八十六艘，近已建造完成，其理由乃係遠東方面，當有需用此項軍艦之一日云云，這又是表明美國爭取遠東門戶的决心。美國新近建造完成的八十六艘軍艦，卽爲應付這行動的需要。</p>
<p>在這裏，我們可以看出遠東問題的嚴重性。然成爲問題中心的中國，對於自己的門戶，將作若何處置呢？</p>

<p>每次每次，當我從我這恰像鴿子籠底昏黑而低矮的攔樓里窒悶得爬下來，而從後門溜出到那陰暗而狹小底衖堂的時候；一支枯澀底帶着爛香蕉皮底顏色的戰抖底手，就映入了我底眼簾。慢慢地，慢慢地移近來，移近來：移近到我底腰際，於是戰抖得更加厲害了。</p>
<p>這是一個老人，一個殘廢得祗剩一條腿和一支手底老人：一身襤褸底衣服，一張襤褸底臉孔，一頭襤褸底黄髮，已經使人看去就會馬上感覺到這並非是一個人了。而是一個，一個什麽呢？我說不上來。像一個垃圾堆罷？一個汚穢得溢着使人作嘔底奇臭氣味的垃圾堆罷！然而，他終是一條生命，一條和自己一樣的人類底生命呵！</p>

<p>有一次，是一個呈現着一切活躍底　鬧市聲的早晨，却是悄悄地落着梅雨，飄着砭骨底秋風。我帶了一顆陰暗底心沒精打睬地踱入了那更顯現得陰暗底衖堂的時候，那戰抖手就又呈現在我底眼前了。這一種煩怨底景象差不多使我馬上感到憤怒。我低着頭戚戚地走，然而那戰抖底手却像有一根無形底綫索和我述繫了一樣，仍是祇距離了那麼　僅僅一尺來遠近，跟上來，跟上來。</p>
<p>街堂底進身是修長的；我的步子加緊了一點，然而那戰抖底手却也緊跟上了我底步子速度。拐灣了，我停住了下來，佇立在那動也不一動地，注視着那</p>

<p>牆壁上底用粉筆塗着烏龜打架的圖畫和那已　色的淡白的注射六〇六的廣告。而戰抖底手是移近過來了，幾乎像要來抓我底口袋。雖然我知道我底口袋里邊也沒有什麽，可是我已經不能鎮定，惱怒　滿了一身，我恨恨地鼓起眼睛釘住他—</p>
<p>「你想怎樣？」</p>
<p>而回答我的是那手更戰抖得厲害了。</p>
<p>我不理；我拐了灣一直走向我那屋子後門邊。當我底脚正要跨進門檻的時候；一個戰抖的，無力的，微小的，幾乎像是一個蒼蠅底叫聲一樣地聲音飄在我的耳際—</p>
<p>「先生！」</p>
<p>我馬上知道又是那討厭的老傢伙了。當我別轉身去一望的時候，那戰抖底手又　入了我底眼簾。</p>
<p>我無力搖搖頭，我底手此刻就本能塞進了口袋，袋里邊是空空的，僅僅摸索出一支「老虎灶」的籌截來了。他失望地看着我握着籌截底手不知怎麽的也戰抖了起來。</p>

<p>——要是趕船，可以在水里划他個二十里，從這里坐起，過蛇皮灘，棺材石，一直到謝家街。要是走路，那就沿了這條山道走到謝家街也行。</p>
<p>——趕船好還是走路好？老鐵帶口的問了一句。</p>
<p>——那還不都隨客人的高興，怎樣都行。</p>
<p>沿了灘水的岸堤有一丈多高，岸邊，栽滿了槐樹，毒烈的日頭像要把濃密的樹叢晒焦，幾隻唧嘹兒沒命的嘶喊着，不覺到有風，空氣帶過來的只是些鬱暑的徵候。</p>
<p>隨便的在岸上走了一下，水，多清，看得見底，底上的綠苔和游魚都很清楚的跳動在眼間。水波，由無際的那端溜過來，使我領悟到趕船是有逆水行舟的危險，對於行旅，是不會方便的。</p>
<p>斟酌了一下，結果，放棄了趕船的念頭，揚起了前鋒的旗號，在麻辣辣地日頭底下進行了。</p>
<p>起先，伕子們還透露了一層企望的神情，由神情里，在告訴你他們是在如何的希冀着採用了第一條的路綫，然而他們不敢說，在眼睛里，含蘊了多少熱烈的光芒呵，終於，光芒收回去，灰喪撲上了他們的心頭。</p>
<p>到太公舖的時候，太陽已有點偏西，打了個尖，塞了一回肚子，看看，是可以走的時候了，但伕頭却一個也不見，就這樣耽擱了二三十分鐘，後來，還是一名伕子不知從那一家烟館里把他們找出來。</p>
<p>——不對，你看老張，老劉兩個伕頭的臉色，更不好看了。我對鐵說。</p>
<p>——爲什麽　呢？是不是因爲打牙祭？</p>
<p>——你問我麽？鬼知道。</p>
<p>上路以後，我們都耽着心，由心底發出了一種共同的意會，彷彿就要有什麽事變和不得了的樣子，非常沉寂，在嘴里不使他發出一點聲息，靜靜地，聽心底跳動。</p>
<p>——奇怪，伕仔們爲什麽也不背誦着他們的術語呢？一塊重量的石子壓住了胸口，不能喘一口氣。</p>
<p>約摸着大概又過了五六里地了，山上的樹更密了，假使埋伏了幾個人，那是不容易看出來的，石級的距離，好像也比從前高了一點，腐蝕得也更壞些。</p>
<p>——輕輕地，不要張狂，前面的九盤子很兇險呢！年青的劉伕頭匆匆地只說了這麽一句，又匆匆地去了。（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c225">江之歌 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— 耶戈</p>
<p>江水激怒着，浪潮像一個發怒的巨人鼓動着氣望海岸沖擊過去。它碰在岩石上尖聲的吼着，於是便粉碎碎，化爲無數白色的浪沫，在晴朗的晨空飛濺着。</p>
<p>遠遠地沿着上流，頂在浪尖上，一隻駁船飛也似的撞將過來，它底前頭有一艘小舢板在隨着浪花起伏地跳蕩着。舢板上站着一個年青的夥子，他頭紥着一塊黑頭布，輕輕的在微風中飄動，穿着一件黑短褂，兩隻手急急地搖着漿。他不時昂起頭看看天，柔和的陽光刺得他皺起眉尖，於是又低下去看看江上汹湧的浪潮之後，便掉過頭去向駁船上一個老兒笑笑。</p>
<p>老兒悠閑地坐在船尾後把着舵，有時也抬頭對這年青人笑了笑，其他的時間，便迷戀在甜美的回憶里。浪潮暴燥地動蕩着，舢板便一躍一躍的跳動起來，年青人忙着急急的划着兩漿，於是便又掉頭向駁船上，輕輕的笑道：</p>
<p>「老爹你着了迷呢！」</p>
<p>老兒惱怒地抬起頭來，向他很很的盯了一眼，便又沉入於美麗的沉思中了。</p>
<p>年青人亢自的笑了兩笑，忽然覺得無聊；於是便尖起嗓子，裝着成年人底腔調，順着勞動的節奏，大聲唱道：</p>
<p>「江水汹汹，撞聲着船兒巔簸，是潮哩！……</p>
<p>船上的老兒，突然大聲咳嗽起來，接着又是緊聯着的兩三個呵欠，年青人碰了嘴，掉過頭去狡猾地大聲笑道：「老爹你着迷，着昏了哩！」</p>
<p>老兒氣憤的喊着，又揚了揚手：「見你底兒去！」</p>
<p>年青人滿足地笑着，掉過頭來，面對着江水又鼓上兩漿，於是便接下唱道：</p>
<p>「浪花掛着情戀，海水埋着黃金……」</p>
<p>近面撲來了陣風，帶着一般陰濕的冷意，年青人張開口大聲的打了幾個呵欠，涎沫飛在朝空又掉在江上。於是又掉過頭，逃着兩隻老鼠眼，挑憤似的同老兒喊道：</p>
<p>「老爹我說何着了迷哩，怎的這樣呆頭呆腦的……」老兒這回可沒生氣，他和藹的笑道：</p>
<p>「小把戲當心等會兒我扯掉你底舌根兒！」</p>
<p>年青人帶着鬼面，忙裝着着急的樣子，伸伸舌頭又用手拍拍胸膛道：</p>
<p>「哎唷，這怎好呢！扯掉我底舌根兒便唱不了歌把老爹你聽……」</p>
<p>江水又激怒起來了，浪花伸長了舌尖，把舢板頂的高高又掉下，青年人憤憤的咬緊了牙關用力的划上兩漿，便又接連着唱下去：</p>
<p>「太陽沉在海邊，舊雁遭着寒聲，但是魚兒呢？……藏在水底深深……」</p>
<p>老兒亢的站起來了，江面的微風吹動他底銀白的鬍鬚，他怔了怔尖銳的眼睛，望那爽朗的晨空看着；於是便微微笑着復又坐下。</p>
<p>年青人還尖起嗓子想唱，一陣波濤突然沖擊在他底舢板上，舢板便擺動起來，他憤憤的划着漿，滿嘴喃喃的咒着。老兒用手撫摸着他銀白的鬍鬚，大聲喊道：</p>
<p>「快到岸哩！」年青人抬起頭看看，便又伊伊唔唔的唱下去了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The League of Nations Six-Nation Committee Confirms Italy as an Aggressor Nation. Using Military Force in East Africa Clearly Violates Treaty Obligations. Report and Recommendations Submitted to the Executive Yuan. Sanctions Against Italy Are Inevitable. <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Six-Nation Committee has completed drafting the report to be sent to the Executive Yuan yesterday and confirmed Italy's responsibility for the war in Abyssinia. The Thirteen-Nation Committee convened at 11:30 a.m. today to discuss this report, and it was fully passed at 1:00 p.m. (Havas News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Six-Nation Committee, consisting of England, France, Romania, Chile, Denmark, and Portugal, which drafted the report to the Executive Yuan of the League of Nations, met this afternoon, chaired by Portuguese Foreign Minister Mendes Leote. The meeting was dedicated to completing the draft report on the responsibility for the recent Abyssinian incident. The report was distributed to the representatives of all countries attending the Executive Yuan this evening and will be submitted for discussion at tomorrow's public meeting of the Executive Yuan. It is heard that the report concludes that the League of Nations Covenant has been violated, and lists various facts of the violation as evidence. The report specifically mentions various declarations and documents issued by Italian officials, especially the order issued by General De Bono, the senior Italian commissioner in East Africa, on October 3, ordering Italian troops to cross the Abyssinian border. Although the report lists various facts without reaching a judgment, there is no doubt that Italy bears the responsibility for violating the treaty and initiating hostile actions in East Africa. (Havas News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Six-Nation Committee has determined that Italy has violated the League of Nations Covenant, based on the following reasons: (1) General De Bono, Commander-in-Chief of the Italian forces in East Africa, issued an order to his subordinates to cross the border; (2) Invasion of Abyssinian territory; (3) Bombardment of Adigrat and Adowa. The report of the Six-Nation Committee, without requiring the unanimous or majority agreement of the League of Nations General Assembly, requires that all countries voting in favor must then adopt the obvious measures of various sanctions, etc. The representatives of England, France, Spain, Romania, Portugal, and Chile on the Six-Nation Committee unanimously agreed to this decision, and their resolution was notified to the Executive Yuan Council last night.</p>
<p>Now that the aggressor nation has been determined, the League of Nations can proceed to consider the second step of sanctions. The final implementation of sanctions is inevitable.</p>
<p>Once the sanctions plan is agreed upon, a committee will be established to manage the implementation. The first step is economic and financial sanctions, including member states severing diplomatic relations with Italy. The second step is the lifting of the arms embargo on Abyssinia and the implementation of a ban on supplies to Italy. It is heard that the League of Nations is currently inquiring with Japan, Germany, and the United States whether they would be willing to send representatives to attend the meetings of the committee managing the implementation of sanctions as observers. (Reuters News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The implementation of sanctions against Italy by the League of Nations is now almost without a doubt. When the Executive Yuan met this morning, it amended the report of the Six-Nation Committee, adding an important concluding sentence stating that Italy engaged in war in disregard of Articles 12, 13, and 15 of the League of Nations Covenant. This judgment is of utmost importance, as Article 16 of the Covenant stipulates that any member who engages in war in disregard of the provisions of the aforementioned three articles of the Covenant shall be deemed to have committed an act of war against all members of the League of Nations, and each member must sever all commercial and financial relations with it and use its armed forces to restrain this aggressor nation. (Reuters News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) This news agency's reporter has learned that the Executive Yuan will not make any decisions when it holds a meeting at 5:00 p.m. today to discuss the sanctions issue, because the implementation of sanctions must await the League of Nations General Assembly to hold a meeting on Wednesday to appoint a committee to decide. After French Prime Minister Laval consulted with the country's experts this morning, he met with British Minister without Portfolio Eden, and then attended the meeting of the Thirteen-Nation Committee at 11:30 a.m. The committee formulated the agenda on behalf of the Executive Yuan, namely: (1) To pass the report of the Six-Nation Committee, which concludes that "Italy violated Article 12 of the Covenant and started a war." (Note: This article stipulates that when a dispute arises between member states, they shall not resort to war until three months after public arbitration, legal judgment, or a report by the Executive Yuan); (2) The Italian chief representative Aloisi raises objections to this conclusion of the Six-Nation Committee, and the Abyssinian representative replies; (3) The Chairman of the Executive Yuan, the Argentine representative Ginazzi, explains that the sanctions are the immediate result of the report of the Six-Nation Committee; (4) All member states of the Executive Yuan, except for the two parties involved, Italy and Abyssinia, may express their opinions. There is no doubt that the report of the Six-Nation Committee will be unanimously passed. (Havas News Agency, 7th)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Contents of the Six-Nation Committee Report Divided into Two Parts <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Secretariat of the League of Nations publicly announced the report of the Six-Nation Committee to the Executive Yuan at 1:50 p.m. The full text of the report is divided into two parts. The first part discusses whether Italy and Abyssinia are in a state of war, and the second part discusses whether Articles 11, 13, and 15 of the Covenant have been violated if a state of war is established. A summary of the main points is as follows:</p>

<p>Describes the events since the start of the war on October 3, and is further divided into five items: (1) The Italian Eritrean troops in East Africa were ordered to cross the Mareb River (which is the natural boundary between Eritrea and Abyssinia) and enter the Abyssinian border; (2) Italian aircraft bombed the city of Adowa; (3) The 14th Italian Air Force squadron flew over the Abyssinian border to carry out bombing; Italian troops defeated the Abyssinian army on the northern route on October 4 and advanced to a place 20 kilometers north of Adowa, namely the town of Daroteker, and bombed Amba Berkemau in Wossa province and Gorabei town in the Wogaden region in the south; (5) Italian troops occupied various cities above Dorro in the south. All of the above facts have been acknowledged by the Italian official gazette and occurred before the report that the Thirteen-Nation Committee should have submitted to the Executive Yuan in accordance with Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the Covenant was submitted to the Executive Yuan. (Note: Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the Covenant stipulates that if the dispute cannot be resolved in this way, the Executive Yuan shall, by a unanimous or majority vote, issue a report stating the facts of the dispute and the recommendations that the Executive Yuan deems fair and appropriate.)</p>
<p>Part Two</p>
<p>Also divided into seven items: (1) States Articles 12, 13, and 15 of the Covenant; (2) After the Walwal incident occurred last December, the Italian government sent a note to the Executive Yuan protesting against Abyssinia's actions, based on facts that were even more serious than the Walwal incident. The Abyssinian government then submitted the Walwal incident to the Executive Yuan; (3) The Italian representative declared that his country reserved the freedom of action to protect its colonies and its original interests, and said that the Covenant was not enough to resolve the dispute; (4) Disputes between member states must not be resolved by war; (5) Italy and Abyssinia are both signatories to the Kellogg-Briand Pact and have an obligation to use peaceful means to resolve all disputes; (6) On October 5, the Abyssinian government sent a note to the Executive Yuan, invoking Article 16, Paragraph 1 of the Covenant, stating that if a member state engages in war against another member state, it should be regarded as an act of war against all member states; (7) In accordance with Article 16 of the Covenant, all member states have an obligation to consider sanctions measures for the current dispute, even if the parties concerned have not formally declared war. The Six-Nation Committee report concludes that Italy has violated Article 12 of the Covenant and started a war. (Havas News Agency, 7th)</p>

<p>(Paris) Although England has rejected Italy's proposal to negotiate with Mussolini and insists that the Italian-Abyssinian dispute should be handled by the League of Nations, it is heard today that French Foreign Minister Laval has resumed efforts to reach a compromise between England and Italy. According to authoritative sources, Laval communicated with Mussolini by telephone at the end of last week in the Chateau d'Aulnoy. Mussolini wants to reopen the Anglo-French-Italian conference of 1906 to amend the treaty. Laval currently believes that the current situation is more conducive to three-nation negotiations, because the Italian army has occupied Adowa, and Mussolini has gained the momentum he needs for the Italian people, so even if he makes a slight concession and stops the East African war, he can avoid losing Italy's "face."

<p>(Paris) The news of the fall of Adowa has had a seemingly reassuring effect on the French people. The public hopes that after the Italian army has gained "face," Mussolini can use this opportunity to end the conflict and still resolve the Italian-Abyssinian dispute through negotiations. Le Figaro newspaper said that the sacrifice to the "law of the jungle" has now succeeded, and now it is time to turn to making sacrifices to the law of reason. Le Petit Parisien newspaper quoted Mussolini's conciliatory telegram and accepted it at face value, saying that this would be a glory for our English friends. (Reuters News Agency, 7th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) Italian Chief Representative Sir Aloisi submitted a document to the French delegation today, which is said to contain Italy's conditions for peace with Abyssinia. According to reliable sources, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is prepared to consider ending the war, but must accept some of his conditions. It is learned here that the reason for Mussolini's sudden change of attitude is probably due to the French Foreign Minister Laval. (National News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, all sectors of the League of Nations were greatly excited when they heard that Italian Representative Aloisi had visited French Prime Minister Laval and put forward Mussolini's new proposal, but it was later learned that the two men's meeting only lasted four minutes, and Mussolini still insisted on a tough attitude.

<h3 id="e6">Future Italian Military Strategy Focuses on the Eastern and Southern Routes. Abyssinia Deploys Reinforcements and Prepares for a Decisive Battle. Italian Forces on the Northern Route Advance Westward in Victory. <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Abyssinian Capital) After the Abyssinian army was defeated on the Adowa front yesterday, the battle on that front, which had lasted for three days, temporarily subsided. It is heard that both sides are now deploying reinforcements and continuing the battle. The Italian army will encounter even fiercer resistance than in Adowa. The weather has cleared up, and the Abyssinian army can now mobilize faster than before. It is currently advancing towards three fronts: Tigray in the north, Taysi in the northeast, and Wogaden in the southeast, with numbers reaching hundreds of thousands. Therefore, the Italian army must win through a fierce battle before it can continue to make progress. Today, an official report received here stated that when Italian aircraft attacked Adowa, they killed 40 women and 32 children. (Reuters News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Le Paris-Soir reported that after occupying the city of Adowa yesterday, the Italian army is now advancing towards the city of Aksum to the west of the city. (Havas News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>(Asmara) The Italian army, which invaded Abyssinia from southeastern Eritrea, has occupied Mount Moussa Ali in Aoussa. It is reported that the Abyssinian king ordered the army to defend this route to the death, so as to prevent the enemy from cutting off the railway from Djibouti to the Abyssinian capital. Also, the large army of Italian Somaliland attacking Abyssinia has occupied the town of Jelogubi in Wogaden, which is now only 250 miles from its destination, Harar. Progress on the southern route is easier than on the northern route because the terrain is not as dangerous as the northern route. (Reuters News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The scope of operations of the Italian army in East Africa is now becoming clear. The large army on the northern route is in contact with the enemy along a 60-mile-wide front. Another army, mostly composed of indigenous troops, invaded Abyssinia from southeastern Eritrea and is now advancing southwest, hoping to cut off the railway from Djibouti to the Abyssinian capital. The terrain on this route is dangerous and difficult to operate. The army occupying Mount Moussa Ali is now advancing towards the Aoussa grasslands and must pass through several miles of waterless desert, where the temperature often reaches 120 degrees. After passing this, it can advance more easily along the Woyas River Valley. The third army, which launched an attack from Italian Somaliland, is now advancing northwest and has occupied Jelogubi, 250 miles from its destination, Harar. The troops are advancing with caution, especially with regard to water sources, because there is always the danger of drinking poisoned water. Each soldier is now given two liters of water per day, and each troop is followed by a number of goats carrying sheepskin bags filled with water to prevent the water source from being cut off. (Reuters News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>(Harar, Abyssinian Front) The first major battle on the southern front is likely to take place within two weeks. The entire front will extend from the mountains of Wogaden province south to the town of Jijiga. Judging from the current situation, there will be 250,000 participants in the war, of which about 100,000 are Italian troops and the rest are Abyssinian troops. The Abyssinian army has been retreating automatically for the past three days, abandoning the towns on the border. There will be no heavy contact before the Italian army reaches the mountainous area. Akins, a reporter for the Associated Press, returned to Harar last Saturday and saw the whole city in chaos. All the troops have been ordered to drive to Jijiga to prepare for a major resistance. Today's news is that war fever has spread to the tribes on the border of British Somaliland. The local chieftains are all holding banquets to attract scholars to attack the Italian army. In short, Abyssinia has mobilized all its forces. (National News Agency, 6th)</p>

<p>(Asmara) When the Italian artillery heavily shelled Adowa, aircraft also dropped bombs over the city. Then, tanks and dense infantry attacked from two sides. Seeing that they could not resist, the Abyssinian troops defending the city abandoned the city and fled. The Italian army entered the city at 11:30 a.m. this morning and hoisted the red, green, and white flag. The humiliation suffered forty years ago has finally been avenged. (Reuters News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>(Asmara) A special correspondent for the Havas News Agency learned the following about the battle before the fall of Adowa. The right-wing column led by General Maravigna was ordered to cross the Mareb River at dawn on the fourth and attack Adowa. After crossing the river, it advanced 20 kilometers without encountering resistance. On Thursday night, the vanguard reached the Daroteker Pass, which is 2,000 meters above sea level and defended by Abyssinian sentries, and a contact occurred. On Friday, artillery warfare began and the Daroteker Pass was captured. However, there was still the Kassiarci Pass, 10 kilometers from Adowa, which was strategically important and stubbornly defended by the Abyssinian army. The battle was fierce. On Saturday, the Italian army bombed fiercely with aircraft. The tents of 25,000 Abyssinian troops were hit and destroyed, and they could not hold out. On October 6, the right-wing column attacked 7,000 Abyssinian troops with all its strength and captured Adowa. In summary, in this battle, the Italian army relied entirely on sophisticated weapons and the combined attack of infantry and tanks, so although the Abyssinian army resisted fiercely, it was ultimately unable to sustain it. (Havas News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>(Asmara) A special dispatch from this news agency's reporter: From 7:00 a.m. this morning, the left-wing column of the Italian army, led by General Sandini, launched a fierce attack on the Kassiarci Pass. After a fierce hand-to-hand combat, it occupied the pass at 10:00 a.m. This was the last defensive stronghold of the Abyssinian army. After the fall of the Kassiarci Pass, the left and right wings of the Italian army converged and went straight to Adowa. The right wing, led by General Maravigna, first arrived at the outskirts of Adowa at 11:30 a.m. At that time, the troops led by General Seyum of Abyssinia were still fighting bravely, with great momentum. As Italian reinforcements continued to arrive, the Abyssinian army finally abandoned Adowa at the last moment. A battalion of left-wing infantry first rushed into the city. In summary, the Italian army besieged Adowa for three days and nights and captured it after encountering fierce resistance. The predetermined goal of General De Bono, the senior Italian commissioner in East Africa, can be said to have been fully achieved. However, both sides suffered heavy losses in this battle. After the Italian army entered the city, Abyssinian people still hid in houses along the street and opened fire on the Italian army, killing many on the spot. (Havas News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to information obtained here, after the vanguard of the Italian army entered Adowa, the Second Italian Army Corps was fiercely counterattacked by the Abyssinian army. After a large number of reinforcements arrived, the Abyssinian army was repelled, so it took several hours for the Italian army to completely occupy Adowa. (Havas News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>(London) According to dispatches received here, about 2,000 Abyssinian people died in the battle of Adowa. This number is still a rather low estimate. The number of Italian casualties has not been reported, but it is believed to be much less than the Abyssinian side. Count Ciano, Mussolini's son-in-law, led a large bomber in this battle, which was the most effective. The aircraft he personally piloted, after running out of bombs, lowered and hovered over Adowa, using machine guns to strafe the Abyssinian army. At times, there were as many as 24 aircraft bombing the entire city at the same time. (National News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>(Abyssinian Capital) This question was reported today that 16 Italian aircraft bombed the village of Walkait and strafed it with machine guns, wounding six people. The town of Jelogubi was also bombed this morning, killing 45 people. The village of Gorahai was bombed for the second time, but because the soil there was loose, many of the bombs dropped did not explode. According to the above-mentioned three attacks, the number of deaths was particularly small, because the Abyssinian army had followed orders to avoid frontal engagement, so it had already withdrawn in advance to wait for the Italian army to penetrate deeper. (National News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>(Abyssinian Capital) A special dispatch from this news agency's reporter: Italian aircraft bombed the town of Gorahai in Wogaden province today, killing five people and wounding 15 people. It is also heard that Barbe, a special correspondent for the British Daily Mail and the American Chicago Tribune, who was serving with the army, has died of swamp fever. (Havas News Agency, 6th)</p>

<p>(Rome) The news of the Italian army's capture of Adowa was broadcast by radio throughout the country at 8:00 p.m. tonight. According to Prime Minister Mussolini, who met with the foreign press this morning, he had already revealed the news of the capture of the city, but the communiqué issued at 1:00 p.m. did not mention it. Shortly afterwards, Information Vice-Minister Alfieri read Communiqué No. 14 to the press, officially announcing the news of the occupation of Adowa. The communiqué reiterated the battle of Adowa in 1896, saying that at that time, 9,000 Italian soldiers and 761 officers were slaughtered by the Abyssinian army, with 3,800 deaths. However, because the Abyssinian army was greatly weakened after the victory, the Abyssinian Emperor Menelik did not take advantage of the victory to pursue. The Italian people have been enduring hardship for ten years. Now, thanks to Mussolini and the Black Shirt soldiers, the great shame has finally been avenged. This communiqué has now been posted throughout Rome, and there will be a large patriotic demonstration in front of the Piazza Venezia tonight. (Havas News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The news of the fall of Adowa did not spread in Rome until 8:00 p.m. last night. For a time, it spread like wildfire. On streetcars and on the walls in the streets, the words "Adowa Captured" and "Adowa Belongs to Us" written in chalk were everywhere. The whole city was exceptionally joyful. Citizens formed teams and took torches and flags to the Piazza Venezia, cheering loudly. However, because Mussolini was unwilling to appear on the balcony to receive congratulations, the crowd dispersed in disappointment. (Reuters News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>(Rome) After the announcement of the news of the fall of Adowa, the whole city was decorated with lights and colored streamers last night to celebrate. Residents who went to the beach for vacation on Sunday all learned of the news on their way back to the capital. Most private vehicles on the street were posted with slogans saying "Adowa is Mine." Young people and university students carried flags and slogans and walked through the city, demanding that all the city's bands play the national anthem to celebrate. Most people formed teams and went to the "Dogali" monument to hold a memorial service for the Italian soldiers who died in the 1896 battle. Others went to Piazza Farnese to hold a demonstration. A truck, loaded with party slogans and caricatures satirizing the Abyssinian Emperor, traveled throughout the city. Finally, the demonstrators gathered in front of the Prime Minister's official residence in Piazza Venezia and cheered and paid tribute to the former Premier for a long time before dispersing. All parts of the country also celebrated the victory, especially the port of Naples, which was very lively. The local residents formed teams and paraded through the streets, cheering for the King, the Prime Minister, and the Army, and the band played the national anthem and patriotic songs. Soldiers on the street were carried on the shoulders of the people and paraded through the city to show their love. (Havas News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>Black Shirt Premier Sends Telegram of Congratulations</p>
<p>(Rome) After hearing the news of the capture of Adowa, Prime Minister Mussolini sent a telegram to General De Bono, the senior Italian commissioner in East Africa. The telegram read: "I now announce the recapture of Adowa and the re-glory of Italy. I extend my sincere congratulations to you and all the soldiers and express the feelings of gratitude of the entire nation." (Havas News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>Recalling Past Events Makes One Feel Even More Sad</p>
<p>(Rome) After the Italian army in East Africa captured Adowa today, Italy has avenged the humiliation of the defeat near Adowa in 1896. Many people in the press here are recalling the sad old events of forty years ago, so I record them as follows:</p>
<p>In February 1896, Italian and Abyssinian troops fought on the border between Eritrea and Abyssinia. 15,000 Italian officers and soldiers were massacred, with one-third of them dying. At that time, the Italian troops stationed in East Africa lacked food and fodder, and each soldier could only get a small amount of flour each day. There were no doctors or tobacco. The army led by Abyssinian Emperor Menelik totaled 50,000, most of whom were tribal warriors, and only a small number were regular troops. The Italian army was outnumbered, but the military situation was superior, because the Italian army was entrenched in trenches and difficult to break through.

<h3 id="e9">World Newspaper Exhibition Opens <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>— Same</p>
<p>Fudan University's Department of Journalism, taking the opportunity of celebrating its 30th anniversary yesterday, held a World Newspaper Exhibition. Over 1,200 domestic newspapers were collected, encompassing publications from 18 provinces and 8 cities, even reaching remote border regions. Almost all participated. Furthermore, there were 200 bound volumes of valuable newspapers and 50 special items of historical significance. Foreign newspaper participants included those from five continents: Europe, America, Asia, Australia, and Africa. This included 26 independent countries and 12 colonies, totaling 38 entities. Various Chinese and foreign printing machine factories sent machines for display. This newspaper and the Xin Shi Bao also sent several electrical telegraph diagrams for display. A collection of Chinese and foreign exhibits related to newspapers were gathered in one room, a dazzling array truly making it an exhibition of great interest to those involved in the newspaper industry.</p>
<p>The development of the global newspaper industry has only occurred in the last hundred years. The extraordinary progress of modern industry and commerce has dramatically changed human life and social organization. Newspapers, as vital tools for conveying ideas and connecting social organizations, have also advanced with each passing day, leading to their current flourishing state. Although China's newspaper industry has seen some progress in recent years, compared with the newspapers of major countries of the same era, it still seems unable to escape its impoverished and weak state. Daily sales of millions of copies are common abroad but nonexistent in our country. Moreover, the deployment of communication networks and the provision and enjoyment of all material resources are far inferior to those of other nations. This Fudan newspaper exhibition is sufficient to make us aware of our shortcomings and strive for ways to improve. Its significance is indeed great.</p>
<p>However, if China's newspaper industry aspires to keep pace with advanced countries, the efforts of the newspaper industry alone are insufficient. The progress of the newspaper industry is tied to the development of all aspects of society and culture. Furthermore, the rise and fall of industry and commerce, the density of transportation, the elevation of national education levels, and the promotion of the spirit of democracy are all essential factors in promoting the newspaper industry. Looking back at our country, we still lack these conditions. Therefore, how to seek the development of China's newspaper industry is something that people from all walks of life should jointly encourage.</p>

Ye Chucang presided over the meeting. Jiao Yitang reported that etiquette systems and clothing should be determined by the Central Political Council, a plan formulated, and then promulgated by the National Government. He stated that our country currently lacks definite regulations on etiquette systems and clothing, leading to inconsistency, and should be strictly regulated by the government. He personally believed that etiquette and music should suit the modern era without contradicting ancient meanings, promoting inherent Chinese etiquette and music rather than foreign etiquette and music. Regarding clothing, he advocated that the head of state down to the common people should wear blue robes and black jackets for formal attire to demonstrate equality. Civil servants' uniforms, except for the existing uniforms used by the military police and diplomats, should be Zhongshan suits for men and long robes for women. As for casual wear for men and women, it should not be regulated, but women should not be allowed to expose their legs or shoulders, or wear binding corsets. All materials should be domestic goods. He hoped that all comrades would pay attention to the research and promote it. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 7th)</p>

<p>(Guangzhou) According to reliable sources, the Shantou incident has not yet been resolved. The authorities in Shantou are determined to strictly prohibit smuggling. Regarding the Japanese Consulate's request to release the seized Japanese rice, they have not agreed, as the rice is definitely owned by Chinese merchants and the Japanese side cannot consider it a violation of their treaty rights. As it concerns smuggling, the Chinese authorities have the right to handle it. However, the Japanese authorities in Shantou not only demanded the return of the seized rice but also wanted to abolish the provincial tax on imported Japanese rice. (Reuters dispatch on the 7th)</p>

<p>The real reason why Platiali ordered the offensive towards the Albanian border remains unclear to this day. Some say that General Platiali feared being reprimanded and wanted to establish a special achievement to secure his position. After the order for the general offensive was issued, the Italian army set out in three columns every night at 9:00 PM, intending to attack the Rebiani Mountains. However, because the maps used by the army were not accurately surveyed, the columns lost contact with each other midway. At dawn, the Albanian army isolated the Italian army, surrounded them, and launched a fierce attack, and the massacre began. On March 1, 1,000 Italian officers and soldiers were slaughtered. General Platiali escaped with only a small number of guards. In total, nearly 4,000 Italian soldiers were killed in the battle, accounting for 38%. 262 officers were killed, accounting for 46%. The circumstances of the massacre were particularly appalling. 406 people had their right hands and left feet cut off. The Albanian side also had 6,000 killed and as many as 10,000 wounded. It can truly be called a rare and terrible battle in history. (Havas dispatch on the 6th)</p>

<p>The commander of the northern Italian army frontline in Adua, General De Bono, announced today that the Italian army is now targeting Aksum, the ancient religious center of Abyssinia, as its second destination. Previously, the Albanian army had launched a counterattack from Debrasinna to recapture Adua, and the battle was fierce, but they were eventually repelled. It is reported that the Albanian army suffered heavy casualties, while the Italian army suffered only minor losses due to the bombing by aircraft and artillery and the fierce attacks by tanks and infantry. The defense of Adua's garrison against the Italian army exceeded the Italian army headquarters' estimate by about 24 hours before retreating. After the Italian army occupied it, the surrounding locals raised white flags and surrendered to the Italian army. The Italian army headquarters claimed today that the chief of the Hoya area surrendered to General De Bono in the dark during the attack. When the Albanian army withdrew, they still managed to transport Chen Fen's cannons despite the threat of aircraft. According to today's investigation, the Italian army has occupied more than 2,000 square miles of Albanian territory. (National Telegraph on the 6th)</p>
<p>The commander of the northern Italian army frontline, General De Bono, announced today that Aksum is expected to be captured by noon tomorrow.

<p>The Italian army's advance into Abyssinia from Asmara is not as smooth as initially expected. An Italian officer who returned from the front line told a special Reuters correspondent that the major difficulties encountered by the Italian army are hard for outsiders to fully believe. The Italian army is now divided into three routes to invade the same target. They must cope with difficult work. Most of the area passed through is mountainous, so it is extremely difficult to support each other. There are only a few small paths that can pass through the mountains, and there is often a risk of being sniped by the enemy. It is often found that dozens of Albanian soldiers are guarding dangerous passes with only a few machine guns, causing an entire army corps to be unable to move forward for a while. On Sunday, the Italian army encountered the most fierce resistance from the Albanian army in Debrasinna. It is estimated that about 600 Albanian soldiers were killed, wounded, and captured in the battle. (Reuters dispatch on the 7th)</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Italian side in Asmara claimed that Adua had fallen, but according to the Albanian authorities, although the Albanian army is not defending the city, the Italian army has not occupied it. However, the news that the Italian army occupied Adigrat has now been officially acknowledged by the authorities. It is reported that the diplomatic corps stationed outside has requested their respective governments to seek guarantees from Rome that the Albanian capital and Dire Dawa will not be bombed by aircraft, as there are many foreigners residing in both places.</p>
<p>At the same time, the people of the Albanian capital have begun to evacuate. The Albanian King ordered the entire city to dig cellars to avoid air raids. The location is designated on a small hill near the British Embassy outside the capital, as it is unlikely to be bombed by aircraft. Now, residents are helping the old and the young, walking or riding mules to the area, even taking their chickens and dogs with them. In the morning and evening, the entire city will be evacuated. When Italian aircraft attack, there will be no one to be seen except the police.</p>

<p>News from the front line here says that the Albanian army dug deep pits when the Italian army attacked Adua and covered them with green leaves, causing four Italian tanks to fall into the pits, and the people in the tanks were all killed.</p>
<p>The Albanian army on the Wokaden front is still using old tactics, constantly sniping at the vanguard of the Italian army. The Italian army is using aircraft to scout the sky and dropping bombs wherever Albanian soldiers are seen. The reports about the Albanian army recapturing Hualhual are conflicting. The Albanian authorities here solemnly stated that the Albanian army avoided fierce fighting with the Italian army around Adua, following the Albanian King's order last week to only use guerrilla tactics. Therefore, in the Battle of Adua, only the vanguard of the Italian army clashed with the Albanian army's sentry camp. The war in the past four days has had a great psychological impact on the Albanian people, as the Albanian people have never known the ferocity of the new tactics.</p>

The treaty was also approved by Versailles after the European War.

<p>(Geneva) A League of Nations spokesman said officially today that President Roosevelt's arms embargo has swept away obstacles to the League of Nations' implementation of the sanctions plan. The President's announcement has increased the possibility of effective sanctions and reduced the risk of conflict between Britain and the United States when the League of Nations assigns Britain to implement a blockade. It is recognized here that the US President's actions have now completed the following points: (1) Consolidate Britain's position in adopting an effective plan to stop the East African war; (2) The League of Nations can discuss sanctions based on this; (3) Promote the League of Nations to adopt equally strong plans, but only to deal with aggressor countries. The British delegation here is particularly pleased to hear that the US President warned Americans that those who trade with Italy must be responsible for their own risks. It is believed here that this warning is more important than the no-arms embargo, as this warning will make cotton and other commodity exporters afraid to trade with belligerent countries.

Although the ban does not apply to raw materials, it has a significant impact on Italy. Italy is a country that does not fulfill its obligations to repay war debts to the United States, so it cannot borrow from the United States and can only purchase raw materials with a small amount of cash stored in banks.

The lively speeches delivered by the President in Salt Lake City and Boulder were unanimously regarded by the Democratic and Republican parties as the prelude to the 1936 political campaign.

After expressing his attitude, Ambassador Jiang continued, because of the order of his government, he decided to return to China from Tokyo after October 30, so he will visit again in the meantime, continue the talks on September 2, listen to the Japanese side's opinions, and sincerely seek concrete methods for Sino-Japanese cooperation.

<p>Qingjiangpu: In the afternoon of the 7th, about 200 refugees from Hanzhuang, Pi County, including men, women, old and young, were traveling on seven sailboats, passing through Wohe and Huaiyin to the south. Most of them had exposed elbows and looked pale. According to them, it took four days to travel from Pi County to Huaiyin. Along the way, they saw that the water above Xutang had receded day by day, with only a sheet of water remaining. The houses were not visible. The area around Xia Yao Su was in dire straits. The situation south of Liu Laojian was relatively better. They were going to Nanjing to beg for food to prolong their lives. Their words were so sad that those who saw them felt a pang of grief.

<h3 id="e81">What I Saw and Heard in the West: A Glimpse of Wuhan Society <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— By Our Special Correspondent, Ji Yuan</p>
<p>Hankou is located on the left bank of the Yangtze and Han Rivers. The city has a population of about 800,000 and has always been known as the "Thoroughfare of Nine Provinces" and the "Chicago of the East." In fact, the Thoroughfare of Nine Provinces has almost become a thing of the past. With the development of transportation, the export of goods from west to east can go directly to Shanghai via the Longhai Railway or the Yangtze River, and south to Guangzhou for export, unlike in the past when Hankou was the only distribution center for goods exported from the western, northwestern, and southwestern provinces. As for the "Chicago of the East," it seems to be a bit of an exaggeration. Not to mention other things, just considering the only industrial yarn factories in the Wuhan area, three out of the four factories in the area have closed down, and the only remaining one is also on its last legs. According to investigations, the social situation in Hankou, whether in commerce, finance, or people's livelihoods, is difficult. There are more than 20 banks in Hankou, and the number of money houses has decreased from 70 or 80 in the past to 64 recently and is still gradually decreasing. In recent years, the task of banks and money houses has not been to adjust finance and circulate funds but to concentrate cash and recover debts. What is even stranger is that cash cannot be concentrated, debts cannot be recovered, and credit is frozen to a very high degree. The phenomenon of banks swallowing money houses is like big fish eating small fish. The power that used to be the foundation of Hankou's financial organization has declared its disintegration. According to those familiar with the financial industry, the most obvious example is that Hankou's largest Yuyu Money House declared liquidation at the end of June this year due to excessive pressure from the Bank of Communications. At present, many small money houses with better conditions intend to close down voluntarily. (The minimum capital of Hankou money houses is only 3,000 yuan, and the maximum is less than 100,000 yuan.)</p>
<p>In terms of commerce, the number of shops closing down is indeed not small, and regardless of which business, there is a phenomenon of changing bosses three times within a year, especially Guanghuo shops. Most of those who take over as bosses are creditors or shop owners with more capital and longer-term plans. The most popular saying in the Hankou market is "Only shop assistants are seen, not customers." However, there are also many shops that cannot close down even if they want to. The financial industry does not dare to excessively pressure the debts of various merchants, fearing that once a general bankruptcy trend is formed and all shops declare liquidation, they will also inevitably suffer losses. However, they dare not lend funds again to ask for trouble. Therefore, larger shops are in a dilemma. Since the facts are like this, the number of shops declaring closure is increasing day by day. According to the latest statistics, 20 to 30 Guanghuo shops in the city have posted signs saying "Shopfront is for rent." Among the 20 Nanjing-style grocery stores in the city, 16 have closed down. Along Zhongshan Road, which is the busiest area in Hankou, there are also many empty shops.</p>
<p>Although general commerce is declining day by day, the sales of foreign goods are on the rise. Among them, Japanese goods are the most prominent. According to Mr. Li of the Hankou Commercial Monthly, Hankou is a major base for dumping foreign goods, accounting for about nine-tenths of the city's total trade. Domestic goods trade accounts for only one-tenth. Foreign goods are divided into two categories: Japanese goods and European and American goods. The ratio is six for Japanese loans and four for European and American goods. The annual trade value of Japanese goods is about 30 million yuan or more, and this number is still increasing. The main items of Japanese goods exported to Hankou are textiles and cotton yarn, followed by seafood and medicinal materials. The dumping of Japanese yarn and cloth is the fatal blow to the collapse of Hankou's yarn factory industry, etc. In the past, Hankou had several special phenomena. First, the larger the shop, the more losses it suffered. On the contrary, small businesses could barely survive. Second, large restaurants such as Xinghualou have closed down, while economical restaurants have increased instead. The word "economical" has become a fashionable buzzword. Third, there is a large surplus of labor, with nowhere to sell it, especially among middle and lower-class citizens.</p>
<p>Before the great flood in the 20th year of the Republic of China, the real estate business in Hankou was still in its heyday. Banks, both foreign-owned such as the Banca di Cina and Chinese-owned such as the Shanghai Bank, almost all focused on the real estate business, and their profits were several times higher than lending. The current situation is very different. The real estate business is extremely depressed. Often, several or even dozens of houses are unattended. A second landlord of a three-story building has to pay the entire rent himself. Before the 20th year of the Republic of China, if a second landlord owed the landlord rent for three months, the landlord would file a lawsuit with the court, and the court would issue a strict order to pay the rent within a time limit, otherwise, the landlord would be punished without leniency. Now, rent arrears have reached as many as 28 months. The local court has accumulated more than 1,800 cases of requests for rent recovery. The court is very distressed and has no way to deal with them, so it can only temporarily shelve them and discuss them at length.</p>
<p>After the great flood this year, the social situation is such that there are more than 7 million disaster victims in the province crying for food. The Wuhan authorities have strictly restricted the entry of disaster victims into the city. Therefore, the disaster victims cannot stay in Wuhan. (During the great flood in the 20th year of the Republic of China, the three towns of Wuhan still accommodated 300,000 disaster victims, but recently only 1,000 to 2,000 people have been allowed.) However, these people mostly gather near Wuhan or lead a life of fleeing famine in groups, which still indirectly affects Wuhan's commerce and security. The Wuhan authorities are therefore quite worried and also suffer from the pain of providing only a drop in the bucket in terms of relief. Not long ago, Wuhan held a disaster relief fundraising rally, but the amount raised was less than 40,000 yuan. Compared with the fundraising results of more than 400,000 yuan in the 20th year of the Republic of China, it can be seen that the social economy is becoming increasingly depleted.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Amidst the Sound of Winter Prevention: Bomb Case in Guangzhou Municipality: Bombs Left on Changshou East Road: A Naughty Boy Picks It Up as a Toy: Four Children Seriously Injured After the Explosion <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: Since the implementation of the district pacification in Guangdong, the public security in various counties and towns has gradually become stable. Recently, with the arrival of winter prevention, various counties and villages have been organizing joint defense, formulating joint defense covenants, helping each other, and reporting bandit tracks by the village chief, making it difficult for petty criminals to hide. If there is a bandit alarm in a locality, the neighboring village guard team must immediately go to support and intercept the bandits. As for the areas where various counties border, inter-provincial defense regulations are mutually agreed upon, joint defense areas are delineated, and in case of an alarm, the police teams in neighboring areas are dispatched to suppress the bandits, regardless of territorial boundaries. Village police who encounter difficulties in suppressing bandits are rewarded and compensated by the joint defense association. The joint defense associations that have been established include the joint defense associations of Xinhui, Taishan, Kaiping, Enping, and Chixi, etc. As for the urban areas, due to the complexity of the local area, the mix of Chinese and foreigners, and the uneven quality of people, the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau has recently been earnestly protecting the public security in Guangzhou Municipality. In recent days, it has increased the number of plainclothes detectives to investigate various public places, cracked down on public and private clubs, and inspected long-distance buses from time to time to check passenger certificates in order to maintain public security. However, despite the strict searches, there are still bandits who are not afraid of the law and smuggle bombs, plotting wrongdoing, resulting in a bomb injuring people on September 30. The incident occurred at 4 pm that day, at the Changqing Xin Street entrance next to the Changshou Public Security Sub-bureau on Changshou East Road in the city. Seven or eight nearby street children were playing together. One of the girls, named Shao Yinhao, caught sight of an abandoned iron can on the street, which was rectangular and about an inch wide. She picked it up as a toy and gathered with the other children to watch. An old woman on the roadside scolded them to put it back where it was. As soon as the object was thrown on the ground, it exploded with a loud noise, and the roof tiles were shaken. Three young children were injured on the spot, and another five children fell to the ground unconscious. The neighbors rushed forward to inspect and saw that the children were either injured or collapsed, and the situation was very tragic. The Changshou Public Security Sub-bureau immediately sent armed police to the scene of the incident to inspect. It was found that the bomb was very powerful, and there were sharp nails scattered inside. At the same time, three circular unexploded bombs were also found under the wall. The bureau immediately reported the case with the exploded and unexploded bombs. On the one hand, the Municipal Hospital was telegraphed to send an ambulance to send the four most seriously injured boys and girls to the hospital for treatment. The injured were identified as Shao Yinhao, 9 years old, from Heshan County, residing at No. 12 Changxing Society nearby, Shao Jianneng (Shao Yinhao's younger brother), 4 years old, Chen Shaolan, 7 years old, from Nanhai County, and Chen Ruilan, 3 years old (Chen Shaolan's younger sister), the children of the Rongji mosquito net shop owner on Changshou Road. After being sent to the hospital, it was found that Shao Yinhao had serious head and back injuries, Shao Jianneng had serious chest injuries, and Chen Shaolan had serious forehead and lung injuries. Due to excessive blood loss, all three were in a coma and feared for their lives. Chen Ruilan was only slightly injured and was discharged from the hospital after applying medicine. (October 1st)</p>
<h3 id="e83">In Wengyuan County, Guangdong: Discovery of the Big Sword Society Bandits: Demonstrations and Parades Slaughter Local Police Officers: Government Troops Arrive to Suppress Them, Scattering to the Borders of San'nan in Jiangxi <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: The northeast of Guangdong Province is all poor counties with mountainous terrain, and the natives are ignorant and particularly fierce. Therefore, societies that guide people to superstition and secret organizations often incite the ignorant people to plot wrongdoing. Recently, the Changfa Party in Hailufeng in eastern Guangdong and the Big Sword Society in Wengyuan in northern Guangdong are the most famous. After the Changfa Party's unrest was suppressed by the defense army, it has disappeared. However, the Big Sword Society uses Wengyuan and the borders of San'nan in Jiangxi as a gathering place, and it has recently gathered thousands of people. It is found that the Big Sword Society is also known as the Horse Sword Divine Strike Society, and its slogan is to support the weak and eliminate the strong. Its organization is similar to the Yihetuan of the Qing Dynasty. It claims that its members' swordsmanship can resist guns and cannons, and that once the body is trained, even bullets cannot penetrate it. Ten years ago, there were only about 100 members, scattered in Lianping and Xinfeng counties. Later, the organization was expanded, and the party members gathered in Wengyuan. Each of the party members was equipped with a long sword, about three feet long, flashing light to demonstrate to the ignorant people. The members of the association wore yellow lower garments as a sign. Those who joined the association paid an annual membership fee of 12 yuan and could get the protection of the Big Sword Society. In recent years, the number of people has increased, and they have engaged in strict organization, setting up branch associations in the second, fifth, and sixth districts of Wengyuan. A part of them is stationed in San'nan on the border of Jiangxi, calling themselves the Heavenly Kingdom Army, and supporting Li Tianbao as the commander-in-chief and Zhong Riying as the commander-in-chief. They made fixed numbers of flags and banners. The flag is square, with a white sun in the middle, blue above and red below. As the number of party members of the Big Sword Society increased day by day, they became more rampant in the spring of this year. The people in the third district of Wengyuan presented a request to the government to ban them because the gangsters were rampant. The county government issued a notice prohibiting the gathering of the Divine Strike Team. The Big Sword Society believed that the local self-defense force in the border area was weak and that the county army's power was also insufficient. Therefore, on September 9, it gathered 500 to 600 members of the association and held a demonstration parade in the third district, issuing various slogans to incite the people. The county government then reported the situation to the Northwest District Pacification Department. After receiving the report, the Pacification Department dispatched a company of soldiers led by Battalion Commander Feng of the Independent Third Brigade stationed in the county on September 13 to suppress the Bazi area of the third district, ordering the Big Sword Divine Strike Team to sign a bond to disband. The defense army also returned to its original defense. The gangsters were angered by the local officials and resented the local officials. However, they suddenly gathered nearby gangs to besiege Longxian City in the third district of Wengyuan, slaughtering Zhang Zuomin, the patrol officer of the local public security station, and several merchants, looting more than 1,000 yuan in cash, and seizing more than ten rifles from the guards. Then they attacked Nanpu Market in the third district and Gangwei Market in the sixth district. On September 23, the Northwest Pacification Department urgently dispatched the first and second battalions of the Teaching Regiment of the Fourth Division stationed in Yingde County and Liao Daoming's troops of the Eleventh Regiment stationed in Maba to cooperate with the county soldiers to suppress the bandits. The Northwest Pacification Department also sent Councilor Zhang and Judge Feng to the county to direct everything. Each unit advanced towards the second and sixth districts. The Big Sword Team knew that they could not resist, and part of them fled to Lianping and Xinfeng, and part of them fled to the border of Jiangxi. The government troops carried out both suppression and appeasement, and those who were coerced were not punished. More than 1,000 big swords and dozens of inferior guns were seized in the three, five, and six districts of Wengyuan. At the moment, a part of the Fourth Division is stationed there to intimidate and urge local officials to rush to handle the aftermath, investigate the household registration, and compile and train the Baojia system to prevent future troubles.

<h3 id="e84">The Jiangxi Pacification Department is Abolished: The Unfinished Matters of Qingxiang Aftermath: Handled by the Provincial Government and Garrison Troops <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Nanchang Communication: After Chairman Chiang entered Sichuan to supervise the suppression of the Communist bandits, he established the Pacification Commissioner's Office in Jiangxi and appointed Gu Zhutong as the Director of Pacification to handle the elimination of the remaining bandits and local aftermath to complete the task of Qingqiang. When the Pacification Commissioner's Office was established, it divided the entire province into eight pacification zones, and Tan Daoyuan, Zhao Guantao, and others were appointed as directors of the pacification zones in each zone. All the remaining small groups in various places were successively wiped out. The bandit leaders who remained in Jiangxi and had not fled, such as Fang Zhimin, Gao Yongsheng, and Xu Yangang, were either captured alive or killed. In the future, only local troops will need to take on the task of searching and guarding. Therefore, the central government believes that the pacification work in Jiangxi Province has reached a considerable level, so on the 3rd, it issued a clear order to abolish the Jiangxi Provincial Pacification Commissioner's Office. Director Gu Zhutong was transferred to the post of Director of the Sichuan Provisional Headquarters of the Military Commission. After the Jiangxi Provincial Pacification Commissioner's Office received the order of abolition, the Chief of Staff, Dian Qingzhu, asked for instructions on the closing method. All the unfinished matters of Qingxiang aftermath will be handled by the provincial government and the local garrison troops.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Fujian Province Implements Austerity: Administrative Construction and Judiciary All Reduce Political Power: At the Same Time, It Plans to Hold Two New Taxes <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Newsletter: Due to financial difficulties, Fujian Province has implemented austerity measures. The merger of all provincial district administrative inspector commissioners, the reform of the organization of county governments, the salary reduction of civil servants, and the abolition of road engineering offices were all implemented on October 1. After the District Administrative Inspector Commissioner's Office was merged from ten districts into seven districts, the expenses of each district were fixed at 5,000 yuan per month (including the expenses of the security headquarters and the county government where it is located). After the reform of the county government, only three departments were set up. All public security bureaus, education bureaus, road construction associations, and construction associations were abolished. After the salary reduction of civil servants, except for police officers and workers, all salaries were reduced by 10%. If the total amount of the discount is less than one-tenth of the agency's fixed expenses, staff should be laid off or public expenses should be reduced to make up for it. After the cancellation of the engineering offices in each section, only the road construction team was retained to complete the unfinished road work and repair the damaged roads. In addition, the provincial party affairs expenses were also reduced from more than 310,000 yuan per year to more than 260,000 yuan. Now, the provincial party affairs commissioner's office believes that the number of staff in the provincial party headquarters has been reduced and cannot be reduced further, so it has decided to reduce salaries. It is likely to follow the example of administrative agencies and reduce them by 10%. The salaries of party headquarters in each county cannot be reduced further, so it is decided to reduce staff again. Generally, each county used to have two instructors, but now only one is retained. In addition, the Higher Court used to have a three-level, three-trial system and had decided to set up higher branch courts in important areas and local courts in prosperous counties. However, due to financial difficulties and the inability to increase funding, the establishment of other courts will be postponed except for those that have already been opened and will be discussed again next year. Due to the impact of the reduction in political power, the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau will reduce the size of the Health Department and the Fire Brigade. However, the largest expenditure in the province is for the security team, which costs 300,000 yuan per month in total. A few days ago, Zhao Nan, the director of the Security Department, flew to Zhangzhou to discuss with Chiang Dingwen, the director of pacification, to reduce the number of troops by one-third, and the military expenditure can also be reduced to 200,000 yuan. It is likely that the downsizing can be implemented from November. As for the new taxes that the provincial government plans to hold, there are two types: one is the housing tax, which has been formulated into regulations and promulgated for implementation in various counties. A tax of 3% is levied according to the amount of rent, which can generate 2 million yuan per year. The other is the donation of superstitious goods (candles, firecrackers, incense, and foil), which has been decided by the Provincial Government Committee to open, and a donation of 30% is levied according to the price of the goods, which can generate 1 million yuan per year to make up for the financial deficit.

<p>Hankou Communication: The Yuehan Railway Consolidation Planning Committee of the Ministry of Railways, in order to plan the traffic of the entire line, held the second plenary session of the committee on the 3rd at the Xiang'e Railway Bureau. A total of Chairman Xia Guangyu, counselor of the Ministry of Railways, committee member Ling Hongxun, director of the Zhushao section, Li Xiangen, director of the Guangshao section, Yin Deyang, director of the Xiang'e section, special committee member Huang Boqiao, director of the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Bureau, Bian Xiaoxian, assistant of the Ministry of Railways Engineering Department, Chen Yaozu, director of the Ministry of Railways Finance Department, Zou Anzhong, deputy director of the Pinghan Railway, Chen Qingwen, director of the Xiang'e Railway Transportation Department, Zhu Qidian, Tan Peiran, technicians Xia Anshi, Secretary Ma Tingshe, Deng Sixiong, Gao Lunjin, chief auditor of the Zhushao section, and consultants Luo Lu, Feng Lehou, and other important personnel of each road, more than 200 people attended. There were eight proposals from the financial group, one from the road affairs group, nine from the transportation group, seven from the engineering group, four from the mechanical group, three from Xia Guangyu, and four from the committee members. After the conference on the 3rd, the review was conducted separately on the 4th, and the conference was continued on the 5th. It closed on the evening. Plans have been agreed upon on matters such as completing the traffic of the entire line, consolidating debts, opening customs terminals, and intermodal transport across the river. On the 6th, the committee members jointly proposed the entire proposal, and it was decided to take a special car to Hunan on the 7th to inspect the engineering along the road. It is planned to inspect Yuezhou Station on the 8th, arrive in Hengzhou on the 9th, participate in the traffic ceremony of the Zhuzhou-Hengyang section on the 10th, continue to depart on the 11th, and rush to Guangzhou around the 15th. According to Xia Guangyu's talk about the mission of the conference, the Yuehan Railway starts from Wuchang in the north and reaches Guangzhou in the south. It is an important trunk line in southern China. After the establishment of the National Government, it paid attention to the completion of the entire line. This time, the headquarters borrowed Sino-British Boxer Indemnity to complete the unfinished project of Zhushao section, which cost a lot of effort. In the future, after the traffic is opened, the principal and interest must be fulfilled on schedule and credit must be established. Then, the funds required for the construction of new roads in the future can be raised by law. Therefore, its relationship to the future of road administration is extremely important. In order to achieve this goal, the road must have a reliable surplus every year after the entire line is opened to traffic, so that it can be used to repay the principal and interest of the debt on schedule. The most important mission of this conference is to plan the traffic of the entire line and the subsequent development of business, so that the business income, in addition to road maintenance, is sufficient to repay the principal and interest. Therefore, the transportation, organization, engineering, mechanical affairs, and finance of the road after the completion of the unification are all related and must be consolidated and planned in advance, etc. (6th)</p>

<p>Ms. Liu Manqing was previously specially appointed by the Central Government to go to Tibet twice to convey its intentions and conduct investigations. Recently, Ms. Liu went to Tibet alone again, and few outsiders knew about it. When Ms. Liu passed through Hankou, she met the female aviator Ms. Lin Pengxia. Because they took the same ship to Yichang, they changed to a car to Chengdu and then entered Tibet via Dajianlu. Along the way, she changed her attire, hired only one worker, and carried simple luggage. The round trip was tens of thousands of miles, and she was not afraid of hardship. It is heard that Ms. Liu's trip was due to the death of her maternal grandmother, and her filial piety is especially commendable. It is now known that Ms. Liu has completed the funeral and has now returned to the capital.</p>

<p>Nine detectives, including Zhou Yiwen, from the Wuyi County Public Security Bureau's Detective Squad, were ordered by County Magistrate Hou Houzong to cross the border to Shizhuang in the Seventh District of Jiangyin County to arrest four bandits, including Peng Shengrong. However, as they were escorting the arrested Peng Shengrong back to the city, the detectives were in plain clothes and Peng Shengrong was unable to understand the official documents, leading to a misunderstanding among the local villagers. The villagers raised an outcry, gathered a crowd, and forcibly released Peng Shengrong. Detective Zhou Yiwen and others were outnumbered and sustained serious injuries. News on the 6th reported that Zhou Yiwen was being treated at Wujin Hospital, but his condition did not improve. His fever increased, and his brain became inflamed. He died from his injuries at around 4 PM. The Detective Squad arranged for a coffin and other items and reported the matter to the county government for processing. The county government forwarded the report to the District Court Procuratorate, which dispatched personnel to conduct an examination on the morning of the 7th. According to news from Jiangyin, since the incident occurred, Shizhuang Town has experienced several nights of alarm. Local figures have requested that District Chief Shen travel to the Jiangyin County government to request the dispatch of a platoon of security guards to the town for suppression.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Public Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association's executive committee members Xu Xiaochu, Jin Zongcheng, and others recently sent a letter to the association requesting that the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department be advised to curtail expenses and that the Shanghai Telephone Company should not increase prices. In addition to forwarding the letter to the Public Works Department for consideration, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association also replied to the committee members yesterday, stating: "We received your letter of September 28 on October 2, requesting advice regarding the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department, etc., to curtail expenses. We have taken note of everything, and we deeply admire your concern for public welfare. This association has anticipated the economic decline for the past five years and has repeatedly warned the Public Works Department regarding its finances. In particular, on November 10, 1931, we sent a letter to the Public Works Department, stating: 'Government organs, whether central or local, have a fixed financial policy. Before the European War, government finances were based on the policy of 'measuring expenditures by income.' Afterward, the opposite was true, with the policy of 'measuring income by expenditures.' Furthermore, the implementation of financial policies must take into account the economic capacity of taxpayers. It is imperative that private economics are not insufficient while public economics are overly abundant. If the two cannot be balanced, it is better for the private sector to be sufficient than for the public sector to be. Moreover, 'to achieve the greatest effect with the least amount of expenditure' is the highest principle of economics, and both public and private economics must adhere to it as a standard. This should be well known to the authorities. Since the European War, the finances of the defeated countries have indeed been strained, and even the finances of the victorious countries have been stretched thin. In fact, after the European War, countries around the world have suffered from financial panic. In recent years, the stagnation of commerce has greatly affected the public and private economics of various countries. As a result, Japan has adopted austerity policies, the United States has postponed war debts for one year, and the British Labor Cabinet has collapsed due to an unbalanced budget and has been replaced by a national government that is tightening its budget to overcome difficulties. It is evident that government finances must take into account the state of world commerce and the national economy and cannot arbitrarily expand without considering economy. Shanghai is the economic center of China and the eastern hub of world trade. However, Shanghai is only a distribution center for commerce, and Shanghai's commerce relies entirely on the Yangtze River basin, and to a lesser extent on northern and southern China. The Yangtze River basin has suffered the worst floods in China's history in sixty years, and since the Eastern Provinces have been invaded by Japanese forces, trade with Shanghai has come to a standstill. Those who live in Shanghai, in addition to spending heavily on disaster relief, have also lost profits in commerce. Therefore, what is their state of distress? The recent vacancy of new rental properties, with no one responding, is enough to understand the reason. The once bustling western section of Hankou Road is now often closed, which is enough to prove the beginning of the market's decline. Based on the above circumstances, the Public Works Department's financial policy should focus on economy rather than simply seeking to increase revenue to maintain budget equilibrium. This is the common opinion of the citizens. The Association, considering the decline of world commerce, the stagnation of national trade, and the gradual decline of the market, hereby requests that the Public Works Department implement large-scale economic austerity measures and pay particular attention to curtailing administrative expenses and suspending unnecessary projects. Furthermore, there are two types of municipal expenditures: active and passive. Capital expenditures for municipal public utilities fall into the former category because they are productive expenses. Education expenditures, on the other hand, fall into the latter category because their effects are slower to materialize and cannot be measured numerically. However, it can be asserted that any attempt to reduce them will harm both society and the nation. In addition, police and sanitation expenses should be listed separately. The amount of these expenses should be proportional to the effectiveness of the services. For example, if the number of crimes increases, the cost of defense and policing must be expanded. However, whether the expansion is appropriate depends on whether the number of crimes decreases. If the cost of defense and the number of crimes increase simultaneously, this would be a great departure from economic principles. Therefore, the appropriateness of these expenses depends solely on the effectiveness of the services. The Association has the following four suggestions for economy. If adopted, they will help to alleviate the Public Works Department's budget deficit for the coming year. According to the report of the Director of Administration, the expenditure items in the 1932 budget will exceed the revenue items by a staggering 2.9 million taels. 1. The music band (annual cost of 190,000 taels) should be disbanded directly or reorganized under private management, as this is not an essential municipal undertaking. Moreover, it is unfair to use public funds to provide cheap entertainment for a small number of people. 2. Defense expenditures currently account for 39 percent of the Public Works Department's total revenue. However, if more senior staff are replaced with Chinese personnel, significant savings can be achieved in terms of salaries. This applies not only to the Police Department but also to other administrative departments. The Association has repeatedly asked the Public Works Department to pay attention to the employment of senior Chinese personnel, primarily for the purpose of saving expenses. If the Public Works Department can employ more Chinese personnel, the "exchange rate tightening" and "subsidy" items in the current budget can be greatly reduced, resulting in substantial savings. 3. Public works expansion is proceeding too rapidly, and the expenditure on road expansion and other projects is substantial. If economy can be implemented, it will greatly benefit the Public Works Department's finances. The Association is well aware that road improvement is closely related to municipal development and can increase land values along the roads, thereby increasing the department's tax revenue. However, as land values increase, rents will also rise, which will significantly affect the cost of living for citizens. Road expansion is not only a short-term plan but also a long-term strategy. Therefore, the workload should be distributed over several years and gradually constructed. It should not be rushed to achieve immediate results, which would cause any given year's budget to suffer from uneven revenue. 4. Staff salaries should be excellent to attract talented and dedicated staff. However, there are many positions that do not require large salaries to fill. This was suggested by the Economic Committee but has not yet been fully implemented. While the monthly salary of a patrolman is not sufficient to provide security in the current cost of living, the monthly salary of the highest-ranking official is 140 times higher, excluding allowances. British Prime Minister MacDonald recently reduced his annual salary by 1,000 pounds, which could be emulated. The above four points are merely the most prominent. In summary, the expenditure for productive enterprises should not be spared, and the expenditure for improving citizens' knowledge should not be spared, but the focus should be on practicality rather than superficial aesthetics. Taxes that contribute to the increase in crime should be reduced as much as possible. As it concerns the key to the city's prosperity and decline, we are sending this letter for your consideration and prompt implementation.'" Regarding the issue of telephone price increases, we sent a letter to the Public Works Department Board on September 6, stating: "Regarding the issue of the Shanghai Telephone Company's price increase, we are pleased that the Board has temporarily approved an 11% price increase and has, in accordance with the resolution of the Taxpayers' Association, hired experts to conduct research. However, we believe that the scope of the Board's research is too narrow, and the results will inevitably be detrimental to the taxpayers and beneficial to the Shanghai Telephone Company. In order to avoid the Board being suspected of favoring the Shanghai Telephone Company and neglecting the public interest, the Association submitted the case to the Executive Committee meeting on September 3, which resolved that the Board should be asked to expand the scope of expert research for the following reasons: (1) The object of research should be the entirety of the Shanghai Telephone Company. (2) The largest expenditures of the Shanghai Telephone Company are the annual interest of shareholders and reserves, the 4.5% operating revenue subsidy to the International Electric Materials Company, the 5% commission on the purchase of materials, and the income tax paid by the company. (3) If the Shanghai Telephone Company does not use the Haishen method when purchasing materials to avoid changes in exchange rates, the losses caused by these changes will be very large. Therefore, the scope of research should be expanded to include the following three points: (1) The interest rates of telephone businesses around the world are far different from the interest rate of the Shanghai Telephone Company. The Shanghai Telephone Company's 6% debentures were issued in Shanghai and are not excessive. Is it reasonable to have a dividend of 8% and a reserve of 2%, totaling 10%? If not, provide a reasonable interest rate. (2) Operating revenue subsidies, material purchase commissions, and income tax should be paid from operating expenses. (3) Are there ways to avoid losses due to exchange rate fluctuations? Whose fault is it? Should the public compensate for it? If the above three items are not included, any research within other scopes will not have the maximum effect of reducing the burden on the public. We are sending this letter for your consideration and implementation." On September 17, we sent another letter to the Board, stating: "On September 6, we requested that the Board expand the scope of the telephone expert research to include three items. We trust that you have noted and implemented them. We hereby solemnly declare to the Board that if the scope of research is not expanded, the Association will not consider the research report satisfactory, and there is room for consideration regarding the wishes of telephone users. Please pay special attention to this matter. We are sending this letter for your consideration." We have forwarded the above letters to the Public Works Department and stated that the letter covers two points: (1) The Public Works Department should strive to curtail expenses. (2) The Shanghai Telephone Company should not increase prices. Regarding the first point, the Association has repeatedly warned against Shanghai becoming a continuation of Chicago for the past five years and sent a letter to the Public Works Department on November 10, 1931, requesting that it implement austerity policies. We are now sending a copy of the translation for your reference. We also anticipate that the number of vacant houses will increase daily and rents will decrease daily. If the general tax is collected as before, the amount will decrease daily. Therefore, in 1933, the Taxpayers' Representatives' Assembly resolved to collect the general tax on vacant houses, but we do not know the reason why the Public Works Department has ignored this resolution. Instead, it wants to use the valuation power, which has long been replaced by custom, on the basis of "actual rent" to increase rent and increase the actual general tax. Furthermore, it has established a committee with no basis in fundamental law and paid a member a large subsidy in exchange for confidential documents. This is actually a contradictory measure that promotes rent increases and increases the public burden. Furthermore, it has delayed the established eight-year education plan. Why is it necessary to establish a car committee when the Public Works Department's Traffic Division can handle public rickshaws, which only generates over 200,000 yuan in revenue annually? Therefore, we are very dissatisfied with the Public Works Department's failure to economize on public funds. Regarding the second point, the Association has explained it in two letters on September 6 and September 17. Please consider them carefully. This is our sincere hope." We are sending this reply for your consideration.</p>

Revise Contract Quickly to Achieve Equitable Reason. <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has once again sent a letter to the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department Telephone Expert Committee, requesting the cancellation of toll calls between the Chinese and Concession areas, stating: "We, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Concession, have repeatedly detailed the impropriety of charging for calls between the Chinese and Concession areas and believe that the Committee is aware that this should be cancelled. Now, all citizens of the city believe that since all telephones in the Chinese and Concession areas are now equipped with automatic switchboards, and since the distances between the South Shanghai and Zhabei areas and the Concession are short, direct calls are possible without obstruction. However, the Concession Telephone Company inserts manual switchboards in the middle of the lines to record the calls for billing purposes, which forces all citizens to pay redundant fees for the same tool. What could be more improper than this? To correct this impropriety, the toll calls should be cancelled and replaced with direct calls, and the temporary contract between the two parties should be revised as soon as possible to achieve equitable reason and eliminate the citizens' disappointment with the Telephone Company. The Committee stands in an impartial position on this matter and will surely adopt this and provide all our citizens with a satisfactory correction. We are sending this letter for your consideration and approval of revision to show fairness. We sincerely hope for this."</p>

If Our Country Wants to Become Prosperous and Strong, We Must Promote Industry. <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Central Committee Member Zhang Fakui, after resigning from his military post, traveled abroad to inspect the industries of various countries. After returning to China this spring, he went to various provinces in the Northwest for inspection. He returned to Shanghai from his travels on the morning of the 6th. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Zhang at his residence yesterday morning. According to him, his impressions of the trip and his future actions are as follows:</p>
<p>Denies Going to Russia</p>
<p>Zhang first denied the news published in the Shanghai foreign newspapers that Director Wang would send Zhang to Russia, saying, "During my travels in the West, a local journalist asked me about this, and I immediately denied it. Although I met with Director Wang once after returning to China, we did not discuss the matter, nor did I hear that the Central Government intended to send anyone to Russia. In short, such reports are purely speculation and should not be believed." Zhang continued, "I am currently a private citizen, and rumors that the Central Government will give me an important position are also untrue. In the future, whether I do business or enter officialdom, I will be brave and willing to do whatever can benefit the Chinese people."</p>
<p>Investigating the People's Suffering</p>
<p>Zhang continued to describe his impressions of the trip, saying, "I was previously a soldier, fighting day and night, and I was unable to thoroughly investigate the suffering of the people in various places at the time. Looking back, I am filled with regret. Since resigning from my military post, I have traveled abroad and then to various provinces in Shandong, Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Gansu. The local authorities provided me with excellent hospitality, so my journey was very convenient. However, I learned that merchants and travelers found it extremely difficult to travel. The improvement of transportation in the northwestern provinces, which are important border areas, is a matter of urgency. I had intended to go to Qinghai, but I had to cancel the trip due to the inconvenience of transportation."</p>
<p>Not Leaving Shanghai for the Time Being</p>
<p>"After traveling, I decided to rest for a while and do not plan to leave Shanghai for the time being. However, I will visit provinces and cities that I have not yet visited. Based on what I have learned from this inspection, although our country is based on agriculture, we should strive for rural revitalization, but we should also strive to promote industry in order to survive in the modern world. In this 20th century, all countries are striving for industry. Italy was also based on agriculture, but since 1919, it has strived to promote industry and has become an industrial country. The Soviet Union has also gradually become prosperous and strong after years of striving for industry. Therefore, if our country wants to become prosperous and strong, we should pay attention to this. Although I have this intention, I do not have the strength to do so. Rumors that I will establish an industrial company and raise shares to operate it are also false. In short, my heart is willing, but my strength is insufficient. I hope the Chinese people will pay attention to this," he said.</p>

<p>Jiaotong University President Li Zhaohuan hosted a farewell banquet at the school yesterday afternoon for the newly appointed ambassador to Germany, Cheng Tianfang, and invited the deans of various colleges to attend. Before lunch, Ambassador Cheng also gave a lecture to all students at the school's commemorative week, describing the course of the Italian-Ethiopian conflict and predicting that its future outcome would not go beyond three paths: (1) Ethiopia fails early due to insufficient military equipment; (2) a compromise solution is reached after the outbreak of hostilities; (3) various countries are drawn into the vortex, causing a second world war. Given China's weak position, it is hoped that the third situation will not occur. However, even if the Italian-Ethiopian war does not escalate, various countries will inevitably compete to expand their naval, land, and air forces in preparation for a second world war. However, if the various countries can agree on new methods of cooperation, then that would be a different matter, he said.</p>

<p>Former President of Mexico Lázaro Cárdenas, after arriving in Shanghai from Beiping the day before yesterday, drove to the Municipal Government at 10:30 yesterday morning, accompanied by the Mexican Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. Flores, to visit Mayor Wu. The Mayor, accompanied by Secretary Geng Jiaqi, received him and exchanged greetings. They talked for about 20 minutes before departing. Secretary Geng then led them to visit various new constructions in the city center. Mr. Cárdenas did not stay in Shanghai for long and boarded the Hakone Maru of the Japanese Yusen Kaisha with his wife last night. The ship set sail at 2 AM today and left Shanghai for Hong Kong. Mayor Wu's representative, Geng Jiaqi, and the Mexican Consul-General and others went to the Huishan Wharf last night to see them off. According to what Mr. Flores told a reporter from the New Sound News Agency, Mr. Cárdenas's trip was purely for sightseeing. He had no contacts in China or Japan. Rumors that he was inspecting his businesses are also inaccurate, as he does not have any businesses in the Far East, he said.</p>

He has always worked hard to promote and facilitate charitable causes. This time, he led the Overseas Chinese athletes back to China to participate in the National Games, not only to express that they do not forget their motherland, but also to promote the meaning of strengthening their bodies and reviving the nation. In addition to thanking Mr. Hu on behalf of tens of millions of flood victims, he should also express his gratitude because Mr. Hu donated 10,000 yuan to build a hospital in Huangshan, he said. The guests and hosts drank and chatted, and the banquet ended at around 2 PM, with everyone enjoying themselves.</p>

<h3 id="e102">The Second Giant Eurasian Aircraft Was Delayed Yesterday in Siam. Aviator Caspar Telegraphed That Arrival in Shanghai Must Be Delayed by Eight Days, Approximately Until the 15th. <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>A Central News Agency report states that the second IU52 type large aircraft ordered by the Eurasia Aviation Corporation from the Junkers factory in Germany, and piloted by the famous German aviator Caspar and others, departed Berlin for China on the 30th of last month. It arrived in Rangoon, Siam, the day before yesterday. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong on the 7th, and Shanghai on the 8th. This morning, the company received a telegram from Caspar and others from Rangoon stating that the aircraft had encountered obstacles in Siam and must be delayed by eight days, arriving in Shanghai around the 15th. The reason was not detailed. It is speculated that it may have been detained by the Siamese authorities. It is thought that the German side has already intervened and that it will definitely be able to come to Shanghai after eight days.</p>
<p>Small Fast Aircraft; Very High Speed</p>
<p>The 160 type small fast aircraft also ordered by the company from the Junkers factory was recently shipped to Shanghai and has now been transported to Longhua for assembly. Although the aircraft has a single engine, its speed is very high, with a minimum of 300 kilometers per hour. The luxurious and comfortable interior decoration is the best among domestic civil aviation aircraft. In addition to two crew members and six passengers, it can carry approximately 200 kilograms of luggage and mail. After the acting chief of the flight crew, He En, comes to Shanghai, a formal test flight will be conducted.</p>
<p>Shaanxi-Chengdu Aircraft Already Operating On Schedule</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to Mr. Zhu Qin'ao, the station chief of the company in Shanghai, speaking to reporters, the Shaanxi-Chengdu aircraft is now operating on schedule. Last week, the eastbound aircraft was delayed because the Chengdu airfield was not yet perfect, and the wheels became stuck in the mud when departing. It arrived in Nanjing at around 5 o'clock. However, in order to maintain the schedule, it continued flying to Shanghai, arriving at the station at around 7 o'clock. The Longhua station did not yet have nighttime flying equipment. After the company's efforts to install it, it was able to land safely. Passengers greatly praised the company's efforts.</p>

<p>Shen Chang, the director of the Ping-Sui Railway Administration, was dispatched by the Ministry of Railways to Europe, India, and Japan to investigate railways. He is scheduled to depart from Shanghai tomorrow morning (the 9th) aboard the Italian ship Conte Verde to go abroad. He will first go to India to conduct research for a month, and then go to Europe. Yesterday, reporters interviewed him to inquire about the mission abroad, his achievements in Ping-Sui, and his thoughts on the economic problems of North China. He answered each question as follows: 1. The most important things to pay attention to during this trip abroad are: A. The problem of centralized management of railways. B. The method of borrowing materials for new railways and consolidating old debts. Particular attention will be paid to the precedents of Turkey and Soviet Russia. C. The purchase and management of materials. D. The independence of accounting and the auditing system. E. The appointment, management, and relationship between political parties and railway administration of personnel. Attention will be paid to the current situations in Germany and Italy. 2. I was in Ping-Sui for two and a half years, which coincided with the time when the central authority reached its peak, so I was able to obtain the support of local governments. All department heads were personally selected by Minister Gu, and were the best of the time. Therefore, it was possible to achieve: A. Regardless of the station or time, passengers and goods could be transported out within five days after reporting. B. Regardless of the passenger, there was an opportunity to ride in passenger cars similar to those on the Beijing-Shanghai line every day. C. Ninety-five percent of the old debts have been consolidated and can be repaid on time according to the contract. However, these are the minimum qualifications of the railway, and future development and improvement require even more effort. 3. When I was in Ping-Sui, I focused on railway affairs, and I am ashamed to say that I have no research on general economics. I rarely interacted with Japanese military and civilian officials and visiting experts. People such as Umezu, Shibayama, and Sakai were only seen in the newspapers. Therefore, I am ashamed to say that I cannot answer the so-called economic problems of North China. However, based on common sense, the situation in Europe is becoming increasingly urgent and will inevitably affect Asia. North China will bear the brunt of it. This is truly the autumn of crisis and survival, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="e104">The Municipal Public Security Bureau Compiled and Printed "Answers to Questions Regarding Opium Smoker Registration" and Distributed Them to Various Branch Bureaus for Distribution to Citizens. <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Public Security Bureau began carrying out opium smoker registration, the process has been proceeding very smoothly. Although registered opium smokers are very enthusiastic, because the population of this city is so large, it is feared that there are still people who do not understand the meaning of registration and are hesitant to register. Therefore, the bureau has specially compiled and printed "Answers to Questions Regarding Opium Smoker Registration" and distributed them to the bureau's various branch bureaus for distribution to citizens. The content of the Q&amp;A explains the meaning of opium smoker registration in this city without leaving anything out. A New Voice News Agency reporter has recorded the original text of the Q&amp;A as follows: (1) (Question) Why is it necessary to carry out opium smoker registration? (Answer) The meaning of opium smoker registration carried out by this bureau is to clarify the total number of opium smokers and the amount of opium smoked in this city, so as to provide a standard for annual reduction. (2) (Question) Why is it necessary to obtain a opium-cessation license? (Answer) Because the government is considerate of a group of elderly, weak, and deeply addicted opium smokers who cannot immediately quit opium, it has specially formulated a flexible measure to issue opium-cessation licenses to allow such opium smokers to temporarily smoke opium and gradually reduce their consumption. (3) (Question) What are the benefits of opium smokers registering in accordance with the regulations? (Answer) Opium smokers who register in accordance with the regulations are showing that they are obeying government orders. The government allows them to quit opium for free or quit opium gradually within a specified period of two months, so that they will not violate the prohibition. (4) (Question) When does the deadline for voluntary registration expire? (Answer) From July to the end of September of this year is the deadline for voluntary registration. Now, this bureau is extending the deadline by one month because there are still some opium smokers in this city who do not understand the registration procedures. After the end of opium smokers' voluntary registration at the end of October, opium smokers will be arrested, fined, and forced to register. (5) (Question) What are the registration procedures during the period of forced registration? (Answer) During the period of forced registration, this bureau will stop opium smokers from voluntarily registering. Opium addicts who are caught smoking opium in private will be fined from 50 yuan to 300 yuan in accordance with the regulations, and then forced to register. (6) (Question) How will all opium smokers who have not registered in accordance with the regulations after the registration deadline expires be dealt with? (Answer) The registration deadline is stipulated to be the end of this year. After that, this bureau will regard opium smokers who are caught smoking opium in private as opium addicts, and will impose a fine and then send them to a opium-cessation facility for forced rehabilitation. (7) (Question) How many types of limited-time opium-cessation licenses are there, how much do they cost, and how long is the time limit? (Answer) Ordinary limited-time opium-cessation licenses cost 5 yuan. Limited-time opium-cessation licenses for the poor cost only 6 jiao. There is also a travel permit for license holders that costs 3 yuan. Limited-time opium-cessation licenses are valid for six months and must be renewed once. Travel permits expire after three months. After expiration, an application must be made to the local opium prohibition agency for renewal. (8) (Question) If a person who is not poor obtains a opium-cessation license for the poor, will they be punished? (Answer) If it is determined that a person who obtains a opium-cessation license for the poor is not poor, they should be required to obtain an ordinary license and fined twice or five times the cost of the ordinary license. The guarantor will also be fined half of the amount fined to the applicant. (9) (Question) Is it necessary to pay an additional fee to renew a license? (Answer) This bureau plans to adopt the principle of not charging additional fees for license renewal. The first license renewal costs 5 yuan, and the first license also costs 5 yuan. After submitting it to the municipal government for approval, a public announcement will be made. (10) (Question) How can citizens apply for opium cessation? (Answer) The Shanghai North and Shanghai South opium-cessation hospitals have now been established by the Health Bureau. During the voluntary registration period, opium smokers who request opium cessation must fill out an application form and a guarantee form, which can be obtained from the bureau's various branch bureaus. After investigation by this bureau, they will be sent to the opium-cessation hospital for free treatment. When discharged from the hospital, they should fill out a written pledge not to smoke again and file it for future reference. (11) (Question) What should be done if an opium smoker relapses after opium cessation? (Answer) If an opium smoker relapses after opium cessation, after investigation by this bureau or after being reported by someone, this bureau will detain them and transfer them to the local court for punishment in accordance with the law. (12) (Question) How should an opium smoker who voluntarily quits opium prove it and report it to this bureau for filing? (Answer) It is legal for opium smokers to voluntarily quit opium. However, in order to prevent cunning people from using self-cessation as a pretext to evade obtaining a license and secretly continuing to smoke opium, opium smokers who apply for self-cessation do not have to register for a license, but they must quit opium within one month. A certificate proving opium cessation issued by a hospital designated by the Health Bureau must be submitted, along with a pledge not to smoke again, and filed for future reference for random inspections. If this bureau believes that there is still a possibility of fraud, it may still be sent to the opium-cessation hospital for inspection. If it is proven that they are addicted, they will be punished in the same way as those who relapsed after opium cessation after being sent by this bureau. (13) (Question) How should cases of illegally transporting opium and illegally setting up opium dens for people to smoke be punished? (Answer) Cases of illegal transportation and illegal sales that are discovered will be sent to the military law organs for military law punishment, and all their property will be confiscated in accordance with the regulations. In addition, if citizens of this city exchange their opium-cessation licenses, they will be charged additional fees in accordance with the Jiangsu Province method. For example, the first time an opium-cessation license is issued, it costs 6 yuan. The second time the license is exchanged, the fee increases to 12 yuan. The third time, it costs 18 yuan. The purpose of the province's adoption of this method is to increase the fees so that opium smokers can make up their minds to quit opium because they cannot afford to bear the pain. However, this city is adjacent to the concessions. If the Jiangsu Province method is followed, opium smokers who cannot afford to pay will inevitably use the concessions as a refuge. Therefore, citizens of this city believe that this city will also increase fees in accordance with the Jiangsu Province method when exchanging licenses. Therefore, even those with the economic ability to exchange for ordinary opium-cessation licenses come to receive opium-cessation licenses for the poor. The majority are hesitant to exchange their licenses. In view of this situation, in order to alleviate the people's hardship, the bureau plans to adopt a method of not increasing fees for exchanges. Ordinary licenses cost 5 yuan, and licenses for the poor cost 6 jiao. The plan has been submitted to the municipal government for approval. Once the municipal government approves it, a public announcement will be made and it will be implemented.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Ministry of Finance Approves That No Stamp Duty Is Required for Tobacco and Alcohol Licenses <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance to request instructions on whether or not stamp duty was required for tobacco and alcohol business licenses. Yesterday, the Ministry of Finance issued approval No. Shui Zi 7340, stating: "We have received your presentation stating that tobacco and alcohol business licenses are certificates issued by government agencies for the collection of taxes. In accordance with Article 3 of the Stamp Tax Law, stamp duty is not required. You are hereby informed of this approval."</p>
<h3 id="e107">The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Requests a Thorough Investigation of the Xuchang Tobacco Company in Henan Province. This Involves Foreign Businesses Setting Up Factories in Disguise in the Interior. Once This Precedent Is Set, Treaties Will Be Rendered Meaningless. <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry to thoroughly investigate whether the Xuchang Tobacco Company in Henan Province is nominally Chinese-owned but actually foreign-owned, and to strictly prevent this. (The previous content is omitted.) In recent years, foreign businesses have often used the names of Chinese people as their managers in order to deceive people because treaties restrict them from setting up factories and businesses in the interior. The fact that the International Savings Society has set up branches all over the interior is an example of this tactic. According to the letter, the association believes that this matter is of great importance and has sent personnel to conduct investigations. According to Mr. Shen Weiting, the chairman of the Chinese Cigarette Factory Industry Association, the Xuchang Company was organized by Wu Tingsheng with a capital of 100,000 yuan. The company collects British American Tobacco Company tobacco. Since the focus of this case is whether it involves foreign capital, if it is not foreign capital, please provide written certification. Shen Weiting believed that there was something difficult to do and did not agree to do so. Later, he provided a piece of paper declaring on behalf of the company that it was Chinese-owned. However, it was neither signed nor stamped with the association's seal, so it was not a formal and responsible document. Later, larger Chinese cigarette factories, such as Nanyang, Huacheng, and Fuxin, were asked separately, and they all said that they had not entrusted the Xuchang Company to collect tobacco leaves, nor had they invested capital in it. They also had doubts about the organization of the Xuchang Company. The Nanyang Company also stated that few Chinese businessmen agreed with the Xuchang Company and that many opposed it. The association's proposition could not represent all manufacturers. This matter is complex, and it is feared that foreign businesses will manipulate raw materials and public opinion with huge capital, making it impossible to discover the truth. Therefore, we should formally request your ministry to carefully investigate whether the company is nominally Chinese-owned but actually controlled by foreigners. This involves foreign businesses setting up factories in disguise in the interior. Once this precedent is set, treaties will be rendered meaningless, and the harm will be endless. We must strictly prevent this. According to the Nanyang Company, the Xuchang Company has close ties with local officials and gentry. This matter is related to your ministry's investigation policy, so we dare not fail to report the above.</p>

<p>Tenants General Association</p>
<p>Since the preparation of the All-Tenants Housing Rent Reduction United General Association, more than 2,000 groups, businesses, and individuals have participated in the initiation. The association also held an initiators' meeting yesterday. The association sent a letter to all sectors of society stating: "We are writing to inform you of our previous letters and to solicit your comments on the initiation charter. Since we began soliciting initiation work, thousands of stores have responded and participated in the initiation in less than ten days. Recently, we have been sympathized with and supported by all sectors of society. Recently, groups such as the Liangjiang Women's Physical Education Normal School, Zhizhong Girls' Middle School, the Ice and Fresh Fish Industry Association, the Shaoxing Fellow Villagers Association, the first and tenth district branches of the First Special District Citizens' United Association, and the Western District Business Federation of the French Concession have all joined the initiation by sending letters one after another. It can be seen that the public's feelings are urgent and the matter must be carried out. Recently, however, organizations such as the 'Various District Rent Reduction United Association,' the 'Shanghai Rent Reduction Committee,' and the 'First Special District Rent Reduction Committee' have fabricated facts and confused right and wrong in the newspapers, attacking and publicly insulting rent reduction movement groups initiated and organized by tenants, in an attempt to exclude dissidents and achieve their ambitions of monopolization. All tenants are outraged. These associations, etc., are set up in name only and have no substance. They are putting on a false show, not dealing with practical matters, and perfunctorily coping with the situation, harming the overall situation. We are unwilling to stand idly by, so we have automatically initiated and organized this association in order to concentrate the power of the tenants and seek to realize the purpose of rent reduction ourselves. We are open and aboveboard, selfless and unbiased. All important issues will be resolved by convening an initiators' meeting in the future. All participants in the initiation have the right to discuss and vote in order to achieve the effect of collective wisdom and effort. It is by no means like those who are nominal and monopolize in a forced manner. We hope that you will consider the suffering of the tenants and the urgency of the need for rent reduction and provide effective assistance. We are committed to saving ourselves and others, joining the initiation to increase our strength. What to do? We still hope to hear back from you."</p>

<h3 id="e112">Nanjing Road Citizens' First District Branch - Contributing Telephone Rate Increase Opinions - Reducing Spending is Better Than Increasing Rates - The Best Strategy to Preserve Interest <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The Nanjing Road Citizens' First District Branch has repeatedly argued against the proposed telephone rate increase. At the beginning of the expert committee's visit, they already contributed opinions for reference. Now that the experts' research is nearing completion and the report and decisions are about to be drafted, there is deep concern that the committee members may not have thoroughly investigated and studied the situation, and may not fully understand the socio-economic conditions of our country. Therefore, they have again written to the experts, putting forward the reasons why reducing spending is a more effective way to preserve interest than increasing rates. The letter is excerpted below:</p>
<p>Respectfully, our branch previously addressed the Shanghai Telephone Company's rate increase issue, which the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession accepted the resolution of the ratepayers' meeting to appoint your esteemed committee to investigate and study. The merchants and residents of Shanghai are deeply gratified. Our branch submitted five key points to your esteemed committee on August 30 for reference. Recently, we learned that you gentlemen are not only thorough, but also widely solicit opinions from all parties before finalizing the report, which we admire for your humility and willingness to adopt good ideas. We noted that the Chinese Ratepayers Association sent a letter to your esteemed committee on September 16, stating that it had submitted a resolution to the Municipal Council to expand the scope of research, namely: (1) Whether the fixed rate of interest preservation is reasonable; (2) Whether operating income subsidies and material purchase commissions should be outside of operating expenses; (3) Whether there is a way to avoid exchange losses, and to which force this fault belongs, and whether it should be compensated by the public. In addition, several opinions were raised, such as the vast difference between the socio-economic levels of Shanghai and cities outside of China; China being a silver-using country, its currency unit value is much lower than that of gold-using countries, and cannot be compared; China's mechanization is different from Europe, America, and Japan, and has not yet reached the stage of familiarity; Chinese people are more frugal than gold-using countries, etc., all of which are extremely accurate and represent the desires of all users, and are worthy of consideration by your esteemed committee. Now, our branch has important opinions to supplement and state. The Shanghai Telephone Company's proposal to increase rates is solely based on the reason of preserving interest. However, according to the principles of economics, the lower the price, the more users there are, and the higher the price, the fewer users there are. The increase or decrease in the supply and demand of telephone services may also be difficult to violate this established rule. If the telephone company must implement a rate increase or charge per call, users will inevitably decrease rather than increase. Then "the desire to distribute interest" still cannot be maintained. Will this insufficient budget be added to the shoulders of the remaining users, endlessly cycling? Then the company's affairs will not have time to be considered, and thoughts and brains will be used all year round, isn't that a joke? Moreover, the market is indeed in its last throes, and is unusually depressed. Whether merchants or residents, they all consider reducing spending as the best strategy, and are determined not to increase unnecessary expenses. Why can't the telephone company abandon the plan to increase rates, and similarly adopt reducing spending as an effective method to preserve interest? We use this as a way to plan. We pray that you gentlemen will condescend to discuss it.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Mei Lanfang's Performance Aids Disaster Relief - Box Office Success is Very Good - The Grand Theatre - Specially Made Explanatory Brochure <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Mei Lanfang returned from overseas with a great reputation. Feeling the fatigue of the long journey, he originally intended to rest for a while. However, yesterday, there were widespread rumors in Shanghai that Mr. Mei would possibly leave the stage life from now on and take up a professorship at the National Theater. Previously, when he went to Beijing to meet with the central authorities, there were severe disasters in various places and letters and telegrams flew in like snowflakes. Various circles in Beijing immediately discussed and earnestly requested Mr. Mei to perform for disaster relief. Mr. Mei also resolutely agreed because it concerned the relief of disaster victims. He performed on stage for several days and the results were exceptionally good. After returning to Shanghai, the Flood Disaster Relief Association of various provinces in this port was also starting to solicit donations. Therefore, under the initiative of Mr. Du Yuesheng, Mr. Mu Ouchu, Mr. Li Dachao, and others, they rented the Grand Theatre and invited Mr. Mei to perform, and obtained the cooperation of gentry and merchants, famous actors, such as Mr. Wang Xiaolai, Mr. You Jusun, Mr. Jin Shaoshan, Mrs. Du, Mr. Jiang Miaoxiang, and others. It was truly a gathering of heroes, each doing their best. In recent days, it has been full of seats. The "Cosmic Pinnacle" performed last night is one of Mr. Mei's most famous plays. The performance was seamless and coherent. It is difficult to achieve this without Mr. Mei's extensive training. A Central News Agency reporter specifically visited Mr. Gong Jiliang, the person in charge of the Grand Theater, who said that the results in recent days have been very good. The program for today's show was just arranged and announced, and the seats had already been booked out a few days ago. Even foreigners, who have long admired his reputation, come to watch every day. Therefore, the theater has specially prepared a brochure explaining the plays in both Chinese and English, with detailed notes to help the general audience gain a deep understanding of the plays being performed.</p>

<p>Dong Baosheng, the owner of Tongmao Silk Shop at No. 30, Pentang Lane, British Concession, had partnered with Feng Xingbo, Shen Xinzuan, and others to open Yichangxiang Grocery Store in Chunyuan Lane, Nine Acres, in the city, as a branch of Tongmao Silk Shop. Last month, he planned to establish Tongmao's second branch at Junfu Lane, Eight Immortals Bridge, French Concession, named Chengji National Goods Store, and hired Gu Xiwun, who was a foreign socks broker, as a purchasing agent. Gu had long-standing business relationships with sock factories in Datuan Town, Liuzao Town, Nanhui County, etc. After being hired, he purchased four to five thousand dozen foreign socks from various sock factories on behalf of Chengji, to prepare for Chengji's opening. The required price was paid in bank and money shop term bills, or promised to be paid in cash after the opening. Unexpectedly, when the factory owners Wang Yongting, Sun Yaojie, Ni Lechu, Zhou Bosheng, Shen Zhenmiao, Tang Yinlian, etc., came to Shanghai to collect the money, Chengji at Eight Immortals Bridge and Yichangxiang at Nine Acres had both closed. Dong, Feng, Shen, and others had all disappeared. Only then did the creditors realize that they had been deceived. They reported to the French Concession police station and requested an investigation. Later, they learned that Dong Baosheng was located at Tongmao Silk Shop. They went to negotiate, but found that Tongmao's interior was also empty. Therefore, they twisted Dong and went to the Old Gate police station. The police chief ordered an investigation to clarify that the location of the deception was not in the Public Concession. Then, the creditors twisted Dong and sent him to the Second District First Precinct of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, ordering him to provide a guarantor for bail. However, Dong initially pleaded ignorance. The creditors were all small businesses, deeply afraid that the money would be lost. They hired a lawyer to file a private prosecution against Dong Baosheng, Feng Xingbo, and Shen Xinzuan in the First Special District District Court for fraud, arguing that although the location of the crime was in the Chinese and French Concessions, the headquarters was in the Public Concession, and should be under the jurisdiction of your court. They requested that the case be summoned and punished in accordance with Article 339 of the Criminal Law, and attached a civil lawsuit, ordering the defendants to repay the plaintiffs' money, etc. After Dong and others were sued, they knew they could not escape punishment and asked someone to come forward and settle the matter. Yesterday afternoon was the date for the trial of the case. The plaintiff's lawyer stated in court that the case had now been settled and requested a suspension of the trial. Judge Huang Fu Yu approved it. Since the promulgation of the new Code of Criminal Procedure, such lawsuits, even if settled out of court, cannot be withdrawn, and applying for a suspension of the trial may also be a method of remedy.</p>

<p>Wang Deyuan, a native of Taizhou, 34 years old, made a living pulling rickshaws. At about 3:00 AM on the 3rd of this month, at the intersection of Zhapu Road and Bazilu, an altercation occurred with a Japanese person, Tsuruyama Tatsuya, over the rickshaw fare. He was then struck in the head and chest twice by the Japanese person, fell to the ground injured, and was taken to Tongren Hospital by the police who arrived at the scene. Medical treatment was ineffective and he died at 1:00 PM that afternoon. The Hongkou police station was notified and ordered detectives to investigate. Wang's body was taken to the Philander Road Mortuary to await the autopsy. The details have already been reported. The First Special District District Court appointed Prosecutor Guo Wei to visit the mortuary with forensic doctors to conduct the autopsy to clarify the truth. After the autopsy was completed, it was found that the deceased had a fractured skull and died from the injuries. It was also learned that the Japanese person had already surrendered to the Hongkou police station a few days ago, admitting that he had beaten the deceased at the time. He was then transferred by the police station to the Japanese consulate for detention. The deceased's family, through his sister Chen Wangshi, reported to the fellow villagers' association, which hired a lawyer on their behalf to handle all legal procedures. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Guo and others visited the mortuary again and informed the Western police chief of the police station and the deceased's family of the autopsy findings. It was then determined that the deceased Wang Deyuan, male, died from a fractured skull and injuries sustained before his death. The suspect, Japanese person Tsuruyama Tatsuya, should be prosecuted by the police station to the Japanese consular court. The body was handed over to his sister, Chen Wangshi, who signed a bond to take it back for burial.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Lu Xihou and Others - Another New Case Discovered - Accused of Embezzling 15,000 Yuan - Lu Zutong is Also One of the Victims <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The China Industrial Bank closed down on the day after the Double Tenth Festival last year. Lu Xihou, the director in charge of the bank, manager Lu Mengxiang, and Sun Xiren were suspected by the police of embezzlement, fraud, and breach of trust. A public prosecution was filed in the First Special District District Court. After repeated trials, the criminal part was temporarily suspended and transferred to the civil court for liquidation. Now all civil matters have been resolved one by one, so Judge Qian Hongye of the criminal court continued the trial yesterday afternoon. The various embezzled amounts were only discovered after the accountants audited the bank's accounts. It was found that Lu Xihou, Lu Mengxiang, and Chen Zutong, the manager of the Kunshan branch of the bankrupt Ningbo Industrial Bank, colluded to embezzle a huge sum of 15,000 yuan from the China Industrial Bank. Therefore, the police have now added another case, and Lu Zutong has also been listed as a defendant. However, he failed to appear after being summoned. Judge Qian first questioned Lu Xihou, Lu Mengxiang, Sun Xiren, and others about the fact that the issued promissory notes were not honored upon maturity and the refusal to pay depositors who withdrew their deposits. Then, he ordered the police lawyer Ru Baoyi to present the contents of the newly added case. The Western detective in charge reported that after the police received and read the report made by the bank's liquidation accountants, they discovered that the bank issued three promissory notes on October 1 last year, each for 5,000 yuan, totaling 15,000 yuan, all due on October 11. Lu Zutong cashed out this item. It was found to be illegally obtained benefits, causing more losses to the bank's creditors, etc. He also presented the promissory note and related account books for inspection and verification. Judge Qian then questioned Xi, Meng, and the two defendants. He then ordered the police to prepare a written report on the investigation of the promissory note to make it easier to understand, and ordered the defendants to wait for another trial next Monday afternoon.</p>

<p>Shi Huieng, a native of Liyang, residing in the Hongkou Tilan Bridge area (a descendant of Shi Kefa, a great politician of the late Ming Dynasty), is a distinguished family in Liyang. The family fortune is small. His wife, Shi Zhangshi (namely Zhang Jinmei), 21 years old, is also a famous and virtuous woman in Liyang. The couple has a harmonious relationship. This summer, Shi Hukeng ordered Zhang to sell rice back to his hometown. Unexpectedly, the evil young man Sun Chasusn threatened and seduced her into adultery. He deceived all the rice money of 845 yuan and the gold bracelets she carried with her. Zhang Mei then realized that she had been fooled and her reputation was ruined. She regretted it deeply and returned to Shanghai in shame. She secretly swallowed a gold ring, intending to commit suicide. Her husband noticed it and extended medical treatment to purge it. However, at 11 p.m. that night, taking advantage of people not being there, she left home and hired a boat to the middle of the river, intending to drown. Fortunately, the water police patrol boat rescued her and sent her to the local court, which summoned Shi Huigeng to take her back. Unexpectedly, last month, Zhang Jinmei was seen again by Sun Xingxun when she returned to her hometown, and he threatened her again. He came to Shanghai in the same car and was taken to the local court by a Lu police officer. He was taken into custody pending trial. After Zhang Jinmei returned home from the court, she refused to eat or drink. Also, due to swallowing gold and drowning, her internal organs were damaged. It turned out to be beyond rescue and she died. Shi Huigeng, as the court has a case, then requested an autopsy. Prosecutor Xiao Jin was appointed to perform the coffin inspection. Prosecutor Xiao filed a public prosecution. Yesterday morning, Judge Chen Jingyi specially opened the Ninth Court for trial. Shi Huigeng, represented by lawyer Hu Yuanjun, arrived in court, claiming to be a 37-year-old from Liyang, and also claimed that his wife Zhang Jinmei was deceived and died in shame, causing the plaintiff's family to be ruined. His reputation, money and spirit have suffered great damage. He requested a heavy investigation according to the law. After obtaining the supply of food, the interrogation officer stated that the judge handling the case was currently on leave, and he waited for the extension of the hearing. The defendant Sun Xingxun was also taken into custody.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Two Women Fight Over a Child Case - Chen Yipeizhen Appeals - Obstetrics Female Doctor Arrives at Court to Testify - Court Ordered to Summon Children to Court Pending Hearing <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Chen Yipeizhen, a Beiping woman from outside the house of Chen Yide, a deceased local who operated real estate in Fa Zujie Beile Road No. 360, previously extended the lawyer's agent to file a case in the Civil Court of the Second Special Court against Chen Zhou, the wife of Chen, to confirm the birth son. It is said that in the twelfth year of the Republic of China, she married Chen as a concubine. In July of the fifteenth year, she gave birth to son Xiongguan, named Nengyi. Because she suffered from illness after childbirth, it was inconvenient to raise her. Chen brought back and handed it over to the big wife Chen Zhou to raise him. Xiongguan is ten years old this year. After Chen Yide's death, he wanted to return to him, but Chen Zhou refused to allow him to. He presented photos of his cohabitation with him and other children and He Cuizhen, an obstetrician who gave birth, as evidence. The defendant Chen Zhou claimed that the child was born to her and ordered the two to take the child to the Zhenru Forensic Research Institute for scientific identification of the blood of both parties and the child. As a result, it was believed that both parties had the possibility of giving birth to Nengyi. The court ruled that the ruling rejected the plaintiff's claim. Chen Yipeizhen refused to accept the ruling and filed an appeal with the Third Division of the Jiangsu Higher Court. According to the petition, the High Court was heard yesterday by President Guo Dezhang and by Yu Shiyi and Fan En. The two judges specially opened the Civil Three Court for trial. Both parties were represented by lawyers. First, Chen Yipeizhen, the appellant's representative lawyer, stated the reasons for the appeal, requesting that the original judgment be abolished and a new judgment be made, confirming that Chen Nengyi was the appellant's biological son. The original trial judgment held that the appellant failed to fulfill the duty of proof in the original trial, but the appellant had presented photos and obstetrician doctors as the only evidence. The other party made empty claims, denied the facts, and did not submit any reliable evidence. The original trial did not examine the evidence submitted by the original case in detail. The words in the appraisal certificate of the forensic research institute were ambiguous and a detailed examination is now requested. A diary ledger used by Chen Yide during his lifetime was also presented, with Chen's handwritten records of Nengyi's date and time of birth. Then the representative lawyer of the appellee defended the reasons stated by the appellant's lawyer. The court summoned witness He Cuizhen, an obstetrician, to the case. She first stated that she was introduced to me by Dr. Sun Jieqing, a friend of Chen Yide, to give birth. When she was about to give birth, Chen called me. The rest is the same as what was provided in the original trial. The court verified the words and instructed the lawyers of both parties to suspend the investigation of Chen Yide's handwriting during his lifetime in this case, and instructed the appellee's agent to submit the case next time. The appellee must also bring the child to the court for questioning next time. At the end of the hearing, the court adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e119">A Discussion with Concession Health Authorities Regarding Malaria <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the outbreak of malignant malaria in Minhang, South Shanghai, and the repeated warnings to travelers by the Municipal Council's Health Department, a recent report quoted a certain entomologist as saying that malarial mosquitoes are not good at flying and have never been seen flying more than a mile away. Therefore, this port will never be affected by the malarial mosquitoes of Minhang, and will not endanger the health of the Bodhisattva. Now, a certain person in charge of the Municipal Council's Health Department informed reporters of two points: Shanghai people do not necessarily have to wait for malaria mosquitoes to invade Shanghai to be infected with malaria. The invasion of malarial mosquitoes in Shanghai has nothing to do with whether the mosquitoes are good at flying. The reason why the Health Department has repeatedly warned is that tourists who go to Minhang are not adequately protected and contract malaria, bringing germs back to Shanghai. Second, tourists' cars often carry mosquitoes, in varying amounts. Even when driving from the countryside near Shanghai to the central area, they often carry one or two or three or four mosquitoes. Cars coming to Shanghai from Minhang, if not paying attention, can also be used by malaria mosquitoes as a means of transportation. It can be proved that people who have cars often find that mosquitoes are clustered in the car in the morning, so Shanghai is not completely safe and the importance of cooperation between tourists and health authorities is clear. As for malarial mosquitoes not being good at flying, they cannot fly more than 200 yards each time. This is not consistent with modern scientific discoveries and is not related to the original purpose of malaria prevention.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Representatives of the Vegetable Stalls on Father She Road Petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau Yesterday Morning <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The vegetable stalls on Father She Road in the French Concession were repeatedly banned by the French Concession police station and moved to Kangti Road. Unexpectedly, they were still expelled. Due to livelihood relations, all the stallholders petitioned and negotiated with party and government agencies and the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association and the Citizens' Federation. All the vegetable vendors, since the ban, have been extremely panic-stricken about their livelihoods. Therefore, at 9:30 a.m. yesterday morning, they specially sent representatives Sun Chuanfu, Li Fusheng, Wang Fusheng, Ye Shuiwang, Zhou Wenjin, and others to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition for relief. Yu Tianbi, a staff member of the bureau's First Section, received them and replied that he had already submitted it to the municipal government for verification and urged the vegetable vendors to wait patiently for a solution. The vegetable vendors thought it was satisfactory before leaving. The petition stated: "We, the vegetable vendors, have been unreasonably banned from setting up stalls on Kangti Road by the French Concession authorities. We have already reported the circumstances and requested that the Bureau consider the livelihoods of the stallholders and provide relief. However, many days have passed and we have not been able to resume setting up stalls. It is difficult to obtain a joint letter from 51 stores on the road, requesting the French police station to report that Mr. Fervolet, the Inspector General of the French Police Department, replied in a letter in the 20th year of the Republic of China, approving the establishment of stalls, requesting that the ban be temporarily suspended on the premise of revitalizing the market. However, we have not received the permission of the police station, which has caused the lives of the 83 households and all the children in the family to be extremely panic-stricken. If this situation continues to be unresolved, we will all starve to death. Therefore, we have to continue to submit the petition. We urge you, the head of the court, to sympathize with the livelihoods of the peddlers and approve negotiations with the French authorities to find a way to restore the stalls in order to maintain people's livelihood. We cannot win the urgency of awaiting orders.</p>

<p>The city's garden farm is located in Donggou, Pudong. Since its establishment, the number of seedlings and flowers planted has increased year by year, and the content has been very rich. The area has gradually expanded. This spring, the farm also actively promoted forestry and beautified the city, which is one of the important tasks for the authorities to actively develop the prosperity of the city center. Therefore, it has specially expanded the city center branch at the intersection of Huayuan Road and Qiujiang River. All the flowers displayed by the various offices and bureaus of the city government and public places are supplied by the farm. Citizens who purchase flowers and trees, or those who decorate their gardens, can contact the farm nearby, so the work is particularly busy. The chrysanthemums at the Donggou main farm are already full of buds and can be sold cheaply. The seedlings at the Pipawan branch have increased to more than 200,000 due to years of successful cultivation, and most of them have reached the planting stage. It is also heard that the city's second horticultural exhibition has been applied for.</p>

<p>Zhang Jingduo, a native of Gaoling County, Shaanxi, graduated from Wuchang Literary Middle School and Xi'an Theological Seminary. Later, he studied at Fu Jen Catholic University in Peiping for one year. In the autumn of the 20th year of the Republic of China, he went to Rome to study abroad. He studied at the Pontifical Faculty of Law for two years and obtained a doctorate in law. Then he went to Milan, Italy, to study philosophy at the Italian Catholic University registered by the government and obtained a doctorate in philosophy. He also graduated from the Graduate School of Education. Milan is a large commercial port in Italy. There are more than 300 overseas Chinese doing business there, with very few intellectual classes, so they are often looked down upon and bullied. Mr. Zhang, motivated by the righteousness of his compatriots, contacted them to unite and help each other. He also tried his best to promote the culture of his motherland, changing the attitude of the Italian people towards China. During the previous visits to Milan by industrial, educational, transportation, military and aviation observation groups to Europe, Mr. Zhang must have sincerely entertained and guided them. After years of studying abroad, due to the repeated natural disasters and banditry in his hometown, there was very little financial assistance. Fortunately, the remuneration of writing and lectures was used to supplement the expenses. His spirit of frugality and diligence in learning is enough to be a model for the academic community. Now, the Shanxi government has hired him to run social education undertakings, so he packed up and returned to China. He arrived in Shanghai on the Italian Wheel Kang Defante a few days ago. Mr. Zhang is only 30 years old, knows Chinese, English, French, Italian, German, Latin, and other languages, has profound knowledge, and is passionate about patriotism. He will be able to work steadily to develop the northwest.</p>

Yesterday afternoon, Presiding Judge Dai convened a hearing in Criminal Court No. 9. The defendant, Gan Deyun, did not appear, but his attorney was present and filed a counterclaim for false accusation, requesting a postponement. The plaintiff, Zhang Sixu, stated that the defendant's Judicial Daily, printed by the Damei Evening News, which he manages, owed printing costs. The defendant issued a check, but it bounced when presented for payment. Later, the defendant paid two thousand yuan in cash, wanting to have the check returned, but Zhang refused because one hundred yuan was still owed. On September 24th, at 4:30 PM, the defendant came to Zhang's office in the Aia Insurance Company, causing a great disturbance, using abusive language, and dragging Zhang to the General Police Station, treating him like a criminal suspect. According to the above, the defendant has violated the criminal law. Presiding Judge Dai, noting the absence of the defendant, postponed the hearing for seven days.</p>

<p>Weng Longping, 31 years old, from Jiangsu Province, resides on the upper floor of the Tongxingtai stove shop at No. 24 Xinzha Road, where he has lived for years. Yesterday afternoon around 3:30 PM, the assailant Shen Xiaomao suddenly arrived, armed with a sharp blade, seeking revenge on Weng. When he encountered Weng, Shen, without asking any questions, raised his knife and stabbed Weng repeatedly all over his body. Weng was unable to avoid the attack and was stabbed six times—three times in his right leg and three times in his left arm. Blood gushed out like a fountain, and he collapsed. The assailant, seeing that his purpose was achieved, took the opportunity to escape without a trace. Nearby Chinese police officers sent Weng to Zhilong Hospital for treatment. As for why Weng was attacked by Shen, it is said that Shen had previously committed a crime and was wanted by the police, but his whereabouts were unknown. Weng revealed Shen's hiding place, and Shen was arrested by the police and convicted according to law. He was recently released after serving his term, so he came to seek revenge on Weng.</p>

<p>Zhang Jiquan, 41 years old, the head server at the Huiquan Bathhouse at No. 34, Lane 3, Xiaoyouli, Haig Road, Xujiahui, has worked there for over ten years. He is known for his honesty and is deeply trusted by the owner. On the afternoon of the 4th of this month, Xu Shunfa (also known as A Liuyou), who runs a fish shop in the town, went to Huiquan for a bath. Xu wrapped a gold ring and jade ring and a watch, and gave it to Zhang Jiquan for safekeeping. About an hour later, after Xu finished bathing and dressing, Zhang returned the original package to Xu, who did not open it to wear, but put it in his pocket. Xu first went to the Catholic Church to collect debts, then to the Yangjiaku storytelling theatre to listen to a play. Returning home around 10 PM, he discovered the watch and ring were missing. He rushed to the bathhouse to ask Zhang for them. Zhang replied that he had already returned the package and saw Xu put it in his pocket. Xu denied receiving them, accusing Zhang of swallowing it. He brought Shen Yuchu and Person A, and held Zhang, demanding that he return the original items. Shen and others mediated, and each side agreed to share half of the loss, with Zhang compensating Xu thirty yuan, to be paid on the 7th. Person A asked Zhang Jiquan for a reward of five yuan, of which three yuan was paid, with three yuan still owing, guaranteed by Shen Yutian. The night before last, Shen asked for the money, and an argument occurred because Zhang had no money (some say Shen slapped him twice). The thirty yuan due date was also approaching, so in a moment of desperation, Zhang committed suicide yesterday morning at 5 AM, secretly entering the kitchen shed of the Huiquan Bathhouse, and hanging himself. When discovered, he had already died. The body was reported to the local police station and transported to the Tongren Auxiliary Yuantang for examination. It is known that the deceased's family lives at No. 60 Xiaoyouli, leaving behind a wife, three sons, two daughters, and a daughter-in-law, a family of eight, all dependent on his income. The children are all minors, and their livelihood has been cut off, leaving them in a dire situation.</p>

<p>Third Section Interrogated the Parties Yesterday</p>
<p>The former residence of the late Qian Guisan, Director of the Zhabei Municipal Government, located at No. 63 Changan Road, Zhabei, discovered a handgun and bullets in a kerosene box while demolishing a mezzanine. Fearing an accident, Qian's female owner ordered her maid to sink the handgun under the Xinzha Bridge, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It has been learned that the case originated when Li Guiqing, the deputy leader of the detective squad of the Xinzha Branch, received information that Qian's family was hiding a handgun and bullets. Therefore, Deputy Leader Li reported to Team Leader Bao Ziying, Deputy Team Leader Shi Zuhan, and Leader Liu Changpei, who reported to Director Liao of the branch, who dispatched police officer Sun Kezhi, Zhang Linqing, and detective Zang Nai to investigate. Qian Lu's explained that she had ordered her maid to sink the handgun under the Xinzha Bridge. Therefore, the police officers took Qian Lu's maid Zhang Chen's into custody. At the same time, the police officers hired a boat to retrieve the handgun and bullets. The handgun was found to be No. 2243, and there were twenty-nine bullets. They were taken to the branch, interrogated, and then released on bail. The handgun and bullets were sent to the Second Section of the Public Security Bureau. Yesterday morning, the Third Section used the telephone to instruct the Xinzha Branch to summon Qian Lu's and the maid Zhang Chen's for interrogation. The confessions were roughly as follows: Qian Lu's confessed, "My late husband, Qian Guisan, was in charge of the security forces for many years. We didn't know there was a handgun on the mezzanine. We only discovered a kerosene box while demolishing the mezzanine the other day. I was afraid it would harm someone, so I put it in a cloth bag and ordered the maid to sink it under the Xinzha Bridge to avoid future trouble. Unexpectedly, the Xinzha Branch found out, leading to the interrogation." The maid Zhang Chen's confessed, "I was ordered by my mistress to throw the handgun into the river." The rest of her statement was similar to Lu's. After reviewing the confessions, the interrogating officer released them.</p>

<p>4. Private Schools and Service Corps</p>
<p>Private literacy schools include the following three types: 1. Those supervised by the Municipal Party Department; 2. Those run by factories, companies, and stores; 3. Those run by individuals. (1) Those supervised by the Municipal Party Department refer to the guidance of various district branches and social and cultural organizations. In total, there are 500 to 600 schools, mostly with one class per school, and only run for one term. Around the end of August, personnel designated by the Party Department supervised the examination using the association's test word list and issued certificates of achievement. The procedures are the same as those of the association. After completion, the results are compiled and sent to the association. (2) Those run by factories, companies, and stores are the labor literacy schools run by factories, companies, and stores jointly supervised by the association and the Social Affairs Bureau. Factories were initially required to report on their labor literacy surveys by the end of July, but to take into account the actual situation, the deadline has been extended to the end of September. These labor literacy schools were originally required to open by August 31, but due to special circumstances, many were unable to do so as scheduled. Currently, 152 schools have already been opened in the city, and it is estimated that no fewer than 300 are being prepared or have been operating but have not yet reported. Guidance and supervision are being provided to each of them. (3) There have also been many cases of individuals with enthusiasm for literacy education who voluntarily requested to run schools. These have been instructed to report to the association through the local district offices for assistance. The literacy education service corps uses students from various elementary schools to teach. Since its implementation, the results have been minimal due to the holidays and the lack of knowledge and preparation of the teachers. Many schools have established private literacy schools to complete their tasks due to the lack of enthusiasm and ability of the students to teach. Further promotion of the service corps requires collective thinking and in-depth research.</p>

<p>External assistance, which seems like a blessing at the time, is ultimately a disaster because it prevents you from improving. The person who gives you money is not your best friend. The person who can urge you and encourage you to be self-reliant and self-sufficient is your true friend.</p>
<p>Your work is your life's statue. Its beauty or ugliness, lovableness or loathsomeness, is entirely in your own hands.</p>

<p>— Shijiu</p>
<p>During the summer, malaria is prevalent, so this period is called the "malarial season." This disease is caused by the bite of a mosquito—namely, the female Anopheles mosquito—and has only been confirmed for a little over fifty years. Previously, everyone regarded this disease as a miasma, believing that it was transmitted from polluted air; this disease was especially likely to occur in marshes and other places.</p>
<p>The first person to prove that the female Anopheles mosquito is harmful to humans was Major Laveran, a French military doctor, in 1880. That year, while serving in North Africa, he often found parasites in the blood of malaria patients with the aid of a microscope. In 1898, Sir Ronald Ross, a British military doctor with the rank of major, also found the same parasites in the body of the female Anopheles mosquito in India. These two majors are our benefactors and are forever worthy of commemoration.</p>
<p>Now that malaria had been preliminarily proven to be caused by the female Anopheles mosquito, scientists came forward to conduct further field experiments. In the east of the Tiber River in Italy, there is a large plain that was once regarded as a terrible malarial area. During the malarial season, two scientists went to that place and stayed with the patients. They built a house, opened mesh screens, and lived in it at night. During the day, they naturally came into contact with the patients and even bathed by the river. At night, they allowed the air from the marsh to enter the screen. In this way, although people suffering from malaria surrounded them every day, the two scientists remained healthy. This is an example that proves that to avoid malaria, one must avoid being bitten by the female Anopheles mosquito.</p>
<p>Two doctors from London, England, also volunteered to be bitten by the malarial mosquito. These mosquitoes had bitten patients in Italy and were transported to London in small wooden boxes. After being bitten, the two doctors developed malaria after eighteen days. Parasites were also found in their blood. The doctors who treated them were all unharmed, proving that malaria is not transmitted through the air.</p>
<p>Now the terrible "malarial season" has arrived, so quickly find a way to eliminate those mosquitoes, especially when you see that kind of mosquito perching with its two hind legs high up and its body upright: that is the malarial mosquito!</p>

<p>— Yizhen</p>
<p>The Person Living Above the Street is a pen name; he is actually an unknown writer and an unemployed person who relies on稿費from a few tabloids each month to maintain his livelihood. However, he is also a "romanticist," and his consumption of wine and tobacco is very heavy, so he is hungry for four days out of every ten. Although life is difficult, romance cannot be avoided. He has been in love with a waitress and the landlady's maid, and now he is having a passionate affair with the landlady's sister-in-law. It is said that the landlady's mother is the sister-in-law's mother, but the sister-in-law's father is not the landlady's father. Recently, he gave his lover a piece of cloth, a bottle of perfume, and a bunch of flower threads, with the inscription "I will keep a piece of cloth, a bottle of perfume, and a bunch of flower threads for myself."</p>
<p>His pen name is "The Person Living Above the Street," but he sometimes uses names such as Yingzhen Xiuhua to replace it. Therefore, in addition to letters addressed to Mr. Gu ××, there are also letters addressed to Ms. Gu Xiu× or Gu ×zhen sent to him.</p>
<p>He once invented the "men's breasts are as useless as rat's whiskers" theory, which was admired by his housemate. Someone asked him how he compared himself to men's breasts and rat's whiskers? But he was speechless.</p>

<p>— Yongcai</p>
<p>Regarding the origin of the columns in front of barber shops, in Western countries, it may indeed have originated during the Franco-Prussian War, as Mr. Gu and others stated. However, in our country, there is actually another anecdote-like episode involved. I will record it in this publication without fear of triviality for discussion.</p>
<p>When Emperor Taizu Zhu Hongwu of the Ming Dynasty initially pacified the country and established the capital in Jiangning, because the people's sentiments in various places were turbulent and had not yet been subdued, he was deeply suspicious. After ascending the throne, he ordered a certain general to巡狩in rotation, using this to镇慑. In the general's幕中, there was someone skilled in reading氣 who secretly informed him that the royal氣in Jurong County was very strong and that a覇主would emerge. The general was greatly shocked and immediately drafted a memorial to report it and sought a method of禳解. As a result, a policy of愚民 was implemented!. Jurong residents were forbidden from studying and were not allowed to participate in the imperial examinations. As a result, the talents of Jurong were buried throughout the Ming Dynasty, and none became prominent. However, at that time, the residents of Jurong were very resentful because their prospects for官场had been cut off for no reason. Officials were afraid of inciting incidents and hurriedly reported it. In order to消弭 the怨忿of the Jurong people, Emperor Taizu issued an edict specially allowing the Jurong people to specialize in the barber,修脚, and bamboo industries, and allowing the barber industry to erect旗杆in front of their shops to show glory. Therefore, in front of all barber shops opened by Jurong people, there stood majestic旗杆containing glory. Now, although the旗杆has disappeared due to repeated changes in dynasties. But the columns at the entrance are still a shadow that has been蜕化from the旗杆.</p>
<p>It is said that! On the barber担in Beiping, there is still a旗杆式木杆standing beside the washbasin, which is clear evidence. Moreover, the专营of Jurong people in the barber industry still has this风气, which is also a solid fact.</p>

<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"But I've been here for a few days, and I haven't seen the bathroom," I asked her.</p>
<p>"What? What are you talking about?" The female official seemed very surprised and asked me back, "Bathroom! What is a bathroom! I really don't understand what you're saying!"</p>
<p>I originally wanted to ask her for instructions, but now she was asking me for instructions. So I tried my best to explain to her what a bathroom meant, but she still didn't quite understand because people at that time didn't investigate these things at all. To wash up, all you needed was a wooden basin. There was no need to open a separate bathroom, so it was naturally difficult for her to understand.</p>
<p>"Since there are no bathroom facilities here, then," I thought to myself, my sister and I were forced to use a wooden basin. The Empress Dowager is such a noble person and has lived in the palace for so long. How could she not have a bathroom? So I couldn't help but ask, "How does the Old Buddha wash?"</p>
<p>"If you want to ask about this, you should just go and see for yourself!" The female official seemed very impatient to talk to me and immediately retorted, "You'll have to go in and serve in a little while anyway. What's the point of being so anxious now? …You don't have to worry about it anyway…!"</p>
<p>I was interrupted by her like this and didn't want to ask any more questions, so I waited patiently with this doubt.</p>
<p>Every time after dinner, the Empress Dowager would always gather us close attendants to sit in her 便殿and chat casually—of course, she was always the one who spoke, and we all listened quietly. What was discussed was nothing more than the various events that had occurred that day or the character of the various ministers inside and outside the palace; it always took about an hour or so before she would retire to her bedroom, and only then could others disperse.

<p>— Jiyun</p>
<p>The black tide of unemployment has spread to every corner of the world. The Reserve Bank of India in Calcutta recently recruited eighty temporary employees, and more than 10,000 people have volunteered. Before the start of the interview, more than 10,000 people gathered outside the bank gate, cutting off traffic, and the Reserve Bank was forced to temporarily close its business. If each person took one minute for the interview, it would take at least seven days and nights to talk to the volunteers. Because it hindered business, the bank had to announce an indefinite postponement. As a result, the unemployed rioted and later resorted to violence, calling out cavalry and troops to disperse the crowd before business could begin, but the losses were substantial.</p>
<p>In Serbia, an old man named Velimir was originally a very funny optimist. Three years ago, after suddenly crying on the night of the Christmas Eve, he slept all day long. Except for people giving him food to eat, he was permanently asleep. Last October, King Alexander was assassinated. When the old man was eating, his family told him about the king's death. Who knew that after hearing this, his crying illness复发, and he walked to the king's tomb while crying, crying for four days and twelve hours, and then went home and immediately slept. After waking up this time, his actions were normal, and he was still an optimist. Even famous doctors cannot answer the cause of this disease.</p>
<p>In movies, you often see two people fighting, with one person holding a stool and hitting the other on the head, and the stool leg breaks. If the stool were the same as ordinary ones, then the person being hit would at least be seriously injured, if not killed. In fact, the wood of this type of stool is called "Balsa," which is a kind of softwood. One cubic foot weighs only three pounds, and the wood is so soft that it can be broken with teeth, so hitting it on the head will absolutely not cause injury. The wood is produced in the low-lying areas of South America. Since it has been needed in movies, its value has suddenly increased.</p>
<p>Recently, an advertisement with a whimsical idea was found in the American Times: a newly opened "Daily Dog Walking Company." It started with Qimi Taili, who was the supervisor of an apartment building. Women who lived in the apartment often asked him to take their dogs out for a walk with him. Every morning and evening, he became the guardian of the dog walking. Therefore, he suddenly had the idea of opening this unprecedented new company. The rules were: one walk per day, 5 yuan per month; two walks per day, 8 yuan; three walks, 12 yuan; the guardian rests on Sundays. After the company was founded, business was booming, beyond expectations. Many assistants were hired to accompany other people's dogs out for a walk, and now there are more than 10,000 dogs.</p>
<p>On March 25th this year, a vintage auction was held in Paris, France, and one of the items for sale was the original manuscript of the Treaty of Versailles. The manuscript was the achievement of the end of the European War, and although it was only fifteen years ago, it had historical value, so its value was raised to 45,000 francs. The original manuscript was stored by Foreign Minister Bierce, who was assassinated last winter, and many signatures of famous generals were found on his bookshelf.</p>
<p>George Parke Lyttleton, a 49-year-old commercial artist and product decorator from Chicago, USA, recently went to Dr. Frank's hospital in the area to treat a strange disease. Several years ago, he developed an inexplicable disease, and his body gradually turned into that of a monkey. He had large palms, thin wrists, a bent back, and bent feet. Also, his buttocks hurt, and soon a tail grew out. After Dr. Frank's diagnosis, it was said to be related to abnormal secretions of the mucus glands and thyroid gland. It is not yet certain whether he can be restored to being a human.</p>
<p>There are not many types of Japanese surnames, and they also like to use Dalang, Erlang, and Sanlang for names, so there are many people with the same name and surname. The strangest thing is Isohama Town in Ibaraki Prefecture. There are 420 households with the surname "Sekine," accounting for one-quarter of the total. There are very many people with the same name and surname, and there are four or five people with the same name. The postman there, no matter how good your memory is, you are powerless. Therefore, the local postal office notified the residents that any children born in the future must not have the same name as anyone in the 420 households, in order to avoid confusion. But it is also an unprecedented奇事for the authorities to prescribe people's surnames.</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twenty: Struggling to Live to See Her Beloved Grandchild, Bursting into Tears; Remembering the Past in a Year of Famine, Sowing Wheat Brings Disaster</p>
<p>Not only did he know to drink directly from the water, but he also raised a hand, extending a bent finger, pointing towards the back door of Little Western Paradise. No need to guess, it was clear his intention was to see his granddaughter inside, at least his will was very clear. Given the circumstances, it was unlikely he would make false accusations, so he slowly walked closer, his hands behind his back, gazing at them from afar. Suddenly, Hu's sister-in-law raised her head and, seeing someone watching, was startled. She said, "Someone's coming out." The old lady nodded twice in response, her withered hand still trembling, pointing in this direction. Li Shilian thought, "Are they trying to blackmail me?" This thought made his face turn red and then pale, and his heart began to race. From afar, he saw the old lady's lips moving slightly, as if she were saying something. Hu's sister-in-law looked at Li Shilian, then said to the old lady, "This is Old Master Li, not Old Master Jia. He is a friend of Old Master Jia." The old lady then opened her deeply sunken eyes wide, looking at Shilian. It goes without saying, she still held strong hopes for the people inside the back door. Hu's sister-in-law then left him and came forward, saying with a bitter smile, "Old Master Li, look, our relative really misses her granddaughter terribly. Even if she can't come back, just letting my niece stand at the back door for a moment would be enough. You are good friends with Old Master Jia, if you would be willing to speak on our behalf, perhaps it could be done." (335)</p>

<h3 id="e168">Naval Personnel from the Weihaiwei District <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Weihaiwei originally had twenty athletes participating in the National Games, but due to funding issues, the men's basketball team could not participate. The remaining staff, including Bao Nüde, tennis singles Liang Xiaqi, track and field Liu Chongde, Wang Fuhai, Cao Yanyou, pentathlon Yuan Xingwen, and swimming Liu Zenghou, a total of seven people, led by General Leader Gu Tuier, set off on the fifth of this month and arrived in Shanghai at 1:30 PM yesterday. At around 2:00 PM, they reported to the organizing committee. According to General Leader Gu, due to economic constraints in Weihaiwei, the already registered men's basketball team could not participate, which is deeply regrettable. Furthermore, the people there do not pay much attention to sports, as popular education has not yet been universal. Last year, there were three junior high schools in the entire district, one of which was a church school, but due to a lack of funding, it was closed this spring. Therefore, only two junior high schools remain, and the schools do not focus on physical education. Consequently, most of the athletes participating this time are naval personnel. Women's sports are even more backward, so no women are participating this time. The purpose of this team's participation in the National Games is not to win medals. Being able to gather with athletes from all over the country in one place will at least provide many benefits.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Seventeen Athletes from Tibet <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>The Tibet delegation participating in the National Games consists of seventeen people, led by General Leader Huang Cishu. They arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday and immediately reported to the organizing committee. According to Mr. Huang, the province is located in the remote northwest, and its culture is underdeveloped. Most of the athletes participating this time are from Tibetan schools. Their purpose is only to observe and learn from others, so that people across the country can recognize the Tibetan flag and pay attention to it. The list is as follows: Leader Huang Cishu, Manager Wang Ke'an, Athletes Li Renhuo, Cai Rang, Jiang Zuo, Bao Xingchang, Dan Ba, Long Ben, Zhan Leqing, Qin Youyi, Ren Bandan, Shi Maozhou, Wang Xu, Zhou Ben, Ma Xingrong, Kui Xuan, and others, a total of seventeen people, participating in basketball, volleyball, and track and field.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Athletes from Shaanxi Come from Afar <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Shaanxi has paid great attention to sports in the past four years. In addition to setting up physical education courses in various schools, the Party, government, military, and school sports promotion association was organized this summer to encourage all citizens to pay attention to sports. Most of the athletes participating in the National Games this time are from various schools. They set off on the fourth of this month, led by General Leader Zhang Ziyao, and arrived in Shanghai by express train at 7:15 AM on the seventh. Many fellow villagers from various teams went to the port to welcome them. The team participating in track and field includes Ai Tonggao, Yu Huiying (coach), Yang Hongji, Zhao Fagang, Wu Feiyuan, Wang Zhongxin, Wu Yuhe, Shi Shangwu, Cao Longting, Zhenxi, Li Zhengtang, Song Guangren, Sun Shengxiang (male members), Zeng Fuyin, Pang Jinyu, Gao Mingzhi (female members), and others, a total of sixteen people. The national martial arts team includes Wang Lingchi (coach), Ma Qingyun, Wei Fengde, Shu Shouxin, Zhao Baoyuan, Li Bozhen, Wang Mizi, and others, a total of seven people. It is said that the track and field team had a significant presence in Shaanxi.</p>

<p>A group of ninety-six Jiangsu athletes and staff members, departing from six districts, arrived at the North Station for assembly at 6:30 PM yesterday. Twenty-four male and female athletes from Anhui Province, led by General Leader Luo Liangzhu, arrived in Shanghai on the same train as the Jiangsu athletes at 6:30 PM yesterday. Fifteen representatives from Suiyuan arrived in Shanghai at 10:00 PM last night.</p>
<h3 id="e173">All Jiangsu Athletes Arrived in Shanghai <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>A total of ninety-four male and female athletes and twenty staff members from Jiangsu Province attending the National Games, led by General Leader Zhang Dongping, arrived in Shanghai. Athletes from the fourth district arrived on the Shanghai-Hangzhou train, and athletes from the fifth district arrived on the Dada Wheel, one after another in the morning and afternoon yesterday. Athletes from the first, second, third, seventh, and eighth districts arrived by ordinary express train from Beijing at 9:30 AM yesterday morning. They assembled along the way and arrived in Shanghai completely at 6:40 PM in the afternoon. The organizing committee immediately dispatched several large cars to the venue for lodging. As long as it was not past the office hours of the organizing committee, they were scheduled to report to the organizing committee that day.</p>
<p>Before and After Departure</p>
<p>The Jiangsu athletes were assembled in advance by the Provincial Games Committee in seven locations: Xuzhou, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Suzhou, Songjiang, and Nantong. Those in Nantong took the Dada Wheel and arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, first going to the athlete dormitory at the National Games venue to rest. The athletes from the fifth district took the Shanghai-Hangzhou train from Songjiang and arrived in Shanghai at around 4:00 PM, waiting at the station for the large team to assemble. Eighteen male and female athletes from the eighth district, led by Wu Yihong and Qin Weiming, arrived in Beijing on the evening of the sixth. Together with General Leader Zhang Dongping and staff members Xu Xiaochuan and Yuan Jidong, who were in Beijing, they departed from Beijing at 9:30 AM yesterday morning. The railway added more than ten athletes and staff members from the first district. More than twenty people were added in Wuxi, and more than twenty people were added in Suzhou. Except for a few athletes who arrived in Shanghai on their own, the rest arrived in Shanghai with the large team. Short-distance famous athlete Cheng Jinguan was slightly unwell yesterday and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on his own today.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Strength</p>
<p>The strength of the Jiangsu Province athletes in this National Games is average, with track and field being relatively better. Cheng Jinguan's short-distance running and middle hurdles, Zeng Rongzhong and Li Yanxiang's middle-distance running, and Jin Zhongkang's long-distance running all have hopes of scoring points in the National Games. In women's track and field, Pang Sao Wang's short-distance running and two jumps, and Wu Juxin's short-distance running are the most promising. Yuan Yuanshi's long jump once reached 4.89 meters, breaking the national record, and her high jump also reached 1.30 meters, so scoring points should not be a problem. If they work hard, their names should appear on the list for the two short-distance runners. Ball sports are not in good shape. Men's volleyball and soccer were not selected. The strength of the basketball team is still acceptable. Apart from strong enemies such as Beijing, Shanghai, Pingjin, and Wuhan, Jiangsu can be counted among the top teams. Women's basketball and volleyball are better and may advance to the semi-finals.</p>

<p>One hundred and fifty overseas Chinese athletes from Malaya, led by the general team leader Hu Wenhu and others, arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. Ninety-seven organizations, including the Shanghai Education Bureau, held a welcome rally for the Malayan Chinese athletes at the Greater Shanghai Garden yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Over a thousand representatives from various organizations attended, and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Participating Organizations</p>
<p>In attendance were Hu Wenhu, Lin Jindian, Wang Jingcheng, Lin Aimin, and all the Malayan Chinese athletes, as well as Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Education Bureau Director Pan Gongzhan, Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Xingya (represented by Zhang Hui), Health Bureau Director Li Ting'an, Public Security Bureau Director Cai Jingjun, Xu Shiying from the various provinces' flood relief associations, Yang Hu from the Security Office, Du Yuesheng from the Municipal Council, Li Dachao from the Aviation Association, Yu Zuoting from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Yang Weiyu from the Vocational Education Society, Wu Deyin from the World Student Association, He Bingsong from Jinan University, Liu Haisu from the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts, Hu Duanxing from Jiaotong University, Ye Zhendong from the Shanghai County Government, Pei Shunyuan from the Xinwenbao, Shen Songfang, Hu Zongfan from the Chenbao, Teng Shugu from the Shibao, Chen Dongbai and Zhu Zhiming from the Shanghai News Agency, Sun Mingqi from the Shangbao, Ruan Weicun from the Qinfen Daily, Wang Xiaoying from the China Women's High School, Gu Jingji from Chongjing Middle School, Hu Xiyuan from the Industrial Federation, Yuan Zengyu from the Municipal Sports Association, Yan Fuqing from the Anti-Tuberculosis Association, and representatives from ninety-seven other organizations, totaling over a thousand people.</p>
<p>Welcome Scene</p>
<p>The meeting commenced at 3:00 PM, with Pan Gongzhan, Wu Xingya, Du Yuesheng, Xu Shiying, Yang Xiaotian, Li Dachao, Yu Zuoting, and others serving as members of the presidium, Hu Guigeng as the master of ceremonies, and Zheng Jie, Chen Baohua, Nie Haifan, Chen Shuo, and others as greeters. After the formalities, Presidium member Xu Shiying delivered a welcome speech. Mayor Wu and Director Pan gave speeches. Subsequently, Hu Wenhu, the general team leader of the Malayan team, delivered a response. Finally, refreshments were served, and entertainment was provided. The meeting concluded around 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Chairman's Address</p>
<p>Presidium member Xu Shiying delivered a welcome speech, saying, "The Sixth National Games is being held at the city center sports ground. Over one hundred and fifty people, led by General Team Leader Mr. Hu Wenhu, Deputy Team Leader Mr. Lin Jindian, and Mr. Wang Jingcheng, have returned to the country, pioneering the participation of overseas Chinese in the grand gathering of the motherland. This is truly a magnificent undertaking. Mr. Hu, Mr. Lin, and Mr. Wang are not only leaders of the overseas Chinese but also care about the motherland and are particularly enthusiastic about social welfare and charitable causes, which have long been admired by the people of the country. This time, leading young overseas Chinese back from afar to participate in the National Games and tour the motherland will allow them to gain a deep impression of the motherland's politics and construction. The significance of this is profound and manifold. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, local associations, the China Aviation Association, and ninety-seven other organizations are holding a welcome rally today at the Greater Shanghai Garden. I would like to wish all leaders and athletes good health and a bright future. I offer these humble words to express my admiration and to commemorate this unforgettable occasion."</p>
<p>Key Points of Speeches</p>
<p>Subsequently, Director Pan of the Municipal Education Bureau delivered a speech, roughly stating that the Shanghai community's welcome rally for the Malayan Chinese athletes is unprecedented in Shanghai and rare even in China. Our country has held National Games more than once, and even since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, it has been held three times, but overseas Chinese have never participated. This time, Mr. Hu Wenhu and others led athletes from Malaya back to participate, which is truly an unprecedented grand event. The people of the country should welcome them to commemorate this occasion. However, today's welcome is different from ordinary social events. The significance is briefly described as follows: Shanghai is a place of international observation, and this National Games is being held in Shanghai. During this Games, we can demonstrate the spirit of unity of the entire country, and especially the power of deep cooperation between overseas Chinese and the motherland. If this National Games lacked the participation of overseas Chinese, its significance would be greatly reduced, and the interest would definitely not be as strong. The National Games treats all units equally, but the reason why the Shanghai community especially welcomes the overseas Chinese athletes is because Dr. Sun Yat-sen received the greatest help from the overseas Chinese in the revolution. Therefore, today we have the opportunity to witness the participation of overseas Chinese who have helped the revolution the most in the grand event of the National Games, and the people of the country should sincerely welcome them. As for Mr. Hu Wenhu, the general team leader of your team, who is eager for public good and is known for his benevolence, he is now promoting sports with all his might, which deserves special admiration, which goes without saying, and so on. Next, Mayor Wu gave a speech.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu's Reply</p>
<p>The general team leader of the Malayan athletes, Hu Wenhu, delivered a reply, saying, "This time, we are participating in the National Games, and it is a great honor and gratitude to receive such a grand reception today by representatives of various organizations. The first significance of this trip is to promote sports and learn from each other, so that the athletes can return to Southeast Asia and make further efforts. Secondly, the athletes are very unfamiliar with the situation in the motherland. After returning to the country this time, they will also need to sightsee after participating in the National Games to gain a deep impression and enhance the patriotic thinking of the overseas Chinese. As for the various instructions given to us today by the chairman, the mayor, and Director Pan, we will certainly never forget them," and so on.</p>
<p>Refreshments and Entertainment</p>
<p>The final refreshments and entertainment program are as follows: 1. English song by Ms. Lang Yuxiu; 2. Kunqu opera by Ms. Wang Jie; 3. Song by Ms. Li Lili; 4. "Jasmine Nostalgia" by Ms. Bai Hong; 5. New Moon Dance by Ms. Li Mingjian and members of the New Moon Society's dance troupe; 6. Harmonica performance by the China Harmonica Association; 7. Song and dance by Xingzhong Elementary School; 8. Chinese martial arts by the Jingwu Athletic Association. Ms. Hu Die was originally scheduled to sing yesterday, but she was unable to perform as she did not bring her musical instruments. She only stood up and delivered a simple welcome speech.</p>
<p>Parade Today</p>
<p>Various organizations in the city will host a car parade throughout the city for the Malayan Chinese athletes, which is scheduled to take place at 1:00 PM today. In addition to the cars provided by the organizations themselves, the remaining cars will be provided by the Xiang Sheng Car Company in Shanghai. The route was determined by the preparatory meeting as follows: The athletes' cars will depart from Liangjiang, and the cars of the hosting organizations will depart from the YMCA at Baxianqiao. They will pass through Wenmiao Road in the South City, enter Zhizaoju Road, visit the Jiangnan Shipyard and the Naval Aircraft Factory, return north through Zhejiang Road, pass through Nanjing Road, head east to the Outer Baibo Bridge, turn into North Suzhou Road, pass through North Sichuan Road and Bazilu Road, enter Baoshan Road, pass through Tiantong'an Road, and arrive at the city center to visit the municipal government's construction projects. Then they will enter Jungong Road, pass through Yunzaobang, arrive at Wusong, visit the fort, and return to Shanghai around 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Mr. Ma's Banquet</p>
<p>Mr. Hu recently took advantage of Chairman Lin's visit to Shanghai to pay a visit to the chairman's private residence on Rue Cardinal Mercier with several important members of the Malayan Chinese team and reported on the situation of the overseas Chinese. Tomorrow afternoon, the ninety-seven-year-old Ma Ganbo will host a banquet at the Tushanwan Catholic Church. In the afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Guangdong Fellow Villagers Association will host a tea party at the New Asia Restaurant to welcome General Team Leader Hu and all the staff and athletes to express their appreciation. It is heard that various circles admire Mr. Hu's spirit of caring for the motherland and promoting sports, as he led the Malayan Chinese athletes to return to the country for the first time to participate in the National Games and assumed all the expenses of the team. After the closing ceremony of the National Games, Mr. Hu will travel to Beijing and then to Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan to conduct inspections in order to seek investment and development in our country's industries.</p>

Many of the team's players are also well-known figures. The forwards are sharp, so the team's strength is quite strong. They defeated the Shanghai Guangdong team by a large margin of ten to zero. A brief record of the battle is as follows:</p>
<p>First Half Seven to Zero Yin Jiao Mingming, the beginning touched, Jiang Chao commanded the three armies, and led the troops south. Hu Ke'an intercepted it at the border, and Deng Ziyang kicked it in, opening the scoring. Jiang Chao and Fu Zhibin were unwilling to be left behind, and each scored a goal. The Shanghai Guangdong team resisted bravely, but the forwards were weak and could not attack repeatedly. Hubei's offense was very good, and Deng Ziyang, Fu Zhibin, and Jiang Chao made another contribution, resulting in a score of seven to zero at the end of the first half.</p>
<p>Second Half Two to Zero The Shanghai Guangdong team made major adjustments to their lineup, thinking about revenge. The entire team of soldiers charged with all their might, winning three penalty kicks, but their feet were weak, their shots were inaccurate, and they still gained nothing. Jiang Chao waved his troops again, penetrating deep into the hinterland, and Fu Zhibin and Peng Kangqi made another contribution. Zhu Yunlong, sitting in the center back, saw that the forwards had made their own contributions, and his ambition was soaring. He shot remotely at the goal from thirty yards, hitting the center of the river, making it ten. The lineup is recorded below:</p>

In the first half, the entire Sichuan team gave their lives. Qian Yaobin played out of position, so the forwards seemed to be complete, and they often lingered in the Youyou hinterland. Qian Yaobin got the help of Yun Chongqing and opened the scoring. Zhong Yongshen rose up on the right, and Zhu Chenggui immediately returned the color, creating a score of one to one. Xiao Mengchang managed Fucheng down, and Xiao Zhong responded on the left, scoring a goal effortlessly. The Youyou hinterland was in disarray. Qian Yaobin acted as a matchmaker, and Zeng Zhengqi drew his bow and strung his arrow, hitting the center. Cheng Yize got another windfall. Yun Chongqing and Zhengqi each scored a goal, making it four to four. The atmosphere of the entire field was tense. Each side did not welcome the other. In the second half, the Sichuan team's spirit declined, and their eyes were confused. The ball did not respond to their feet, and the soldiers were tired. Hu Youcheng and Shen Shiqi played their magical powers, Shengfa got the color at the border, and Xi Qiaosheng got two cities in a row. Nine to four, conquering the Sichuan team.

It should be known that the university's existence today is not easy. I would like to report the history of the university to everyone. The university was founded in the year of Yisi in the Guangxu reign, organized by students who split from Aurora University. At that time, the school site was in Wusong. In the first year of the Republic of China, it was moved to Xujiahui. It was presented to the Nanjing Provisional Government for approval and received 10,000 taels of silver in assistance. In the eleventh year of the Republic of China, it moved to the current campus in Jiangwan. After more than ten years of operation, it has reached today's scale. The university has always upheld the principle of hard work, so it has tried its best to economize on administrative expenses in order to achieve this result, which has been recognized by all sectors of society. The country is in dire need of talent. The future development of the university will depend on the enthusiastic assistance of the countrymen. Then he read the congratulatory telegrams and letters from all walks of life, and then the representative of the board of directors, Wang Zhengting, delivered a speech, the representative of the Beijing Alumni Association delivered a congratulatory speech, the representative of Shanghai universities, Li Zhaohuan, delivered a congratulatory speech, the representative of the alumni association, Cheng Tianfang, delivered a congratulatory speech, and the representative of the professors, Zhang Youer, delivered a congratulatory speech.

He sees that the Chinese textile industry is on the verge of danger and is eager to make improvements. Therefore, in April of this year, he resolutely went abroad to Japan for investigation. During his half-year stay in Japan, he carefully investigated famous Japanese textile institutions such as the Toa Textile Co., Ltd. Asada Factory, and Meiji Textile Co., Ltd. Yukihashi Factory, etc., and gained a lot. It is recently learned that Mr. Chen is scheduled to return to China before the Double Tenth Festival.

<p>— Original by American Ms. Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>"He is the only boy we have ever failed with, and I am really sad. I originally thought he had many faults, but his nature could still enable him to become a good person."</p>
<p>When Tang En heard Mrs. Pei sigh, he himself wanted to ask for another chance, but his arrogance would not allow him to do so. So he walked out, his face still indifferent, but he shook hands silently and left with Mr. Pei, leaving only Nai De and Mrs. Shu to send him off with tears, standing and gazing in disappointment.</p>
<p>A few days later, they received a letter from Mr. Bei, reporting that Tang En was doing well, and they were naturally overjoyed to hear that. But three weeks later, another letter came, saying that Tang En had run away, and there was no news of his whereabouts. They were all worried when they heard that. So Pei Jiusheng said:</p>
<p>"Maybe I should have given him a chance then."</p>
<p>But this time, Mrs. Pei nodded, as if she had great insight, and said, "Don't regret it, don't try to regret it, the child will come back, I am very sure of this."</p>
<p>But as the days went by, Tang En did not even show his shadow.</p>

<p>Financial Spot Gold Price Trend Seems to be Hesitating Banks Paid as High as 900 Yuan, but Abundant Supply Ultimately Caused a Slight Drop of 20 Cents</p>
<p>The gold market was even more peaceful yesterday. Silver dollars were in demand, but the gold market seemed to have more supply, and it was difficult to sustain prices above 900 yuan. As a result, it fell slightly. There was only a fluctuation of 4.70 yuan during the day. In the early morning, the overseas silver market rose in London and was flat in the US. The forward price of Mont de Ri remained unchanged or rose by 30 cents. Exchange rates fluctuated, and the price of raw gold in London rose by 2.5 pence. People were calm, and off-market pre-trading opened at around 897 yuan, with an ordinary situation. Da Decheng, Yuanxiang, Hengyu, Chunyuan, Yongdeng came in to buy, and rose to 899 yuan. Fuxingyong, Shui Li, Da Li Cheng took the opportunity to sell at a high price and then fell back. After the opening, the official exchange rate of the Central Bank was announced, with the US and London rates both flat. The customs gold unit was 3 cents, and the standard gold price was officially quoted at 918.5 yuan, showing stability. Although the sellers were active, the buying from banks was particularly strong. After the price fell, the buying interest was strong. Soon, the price gradually rose, and the exchange market tightened. Finally, it broke through the major barrier of 900 yuan. It was learned that HSBC's official exchange rate was flat for both the US and London rates, and the price fluctuated slightly. However, because major players took the opportunity to sell at a high price, the price gradually fell back. Banks that were previously buying sterling now hesitated. However, because bank drafts were sold continuously at a high price, it was difficult for the price to rise. Later, because the banks released some drafts, the sellers became active and the price fell back. However, the prediction of the Indian silver contraction of 6 annas still made it easy to pull the price up. The situation was flat at noon. In the afternoon, the Hong Kong market tightened to 125, and the market became increasingly bullish. Banks and Bombay scrambled to settle their positions, and the exchange market became tight. The buying momentum gradually increased, and the price rose step by step. However, major players still took the opportunity to sell, and the market soon became peaceful again. The initial Indian silver report was a small contraction of 2 annas, and people did not seem satisfied and were not affected. The market situation returned to a flat position. Later, selling gradually poured in, and it became difficult to support the price. Although the second Indian silver contraction was 2 annas, it still reported a flat decline and turned slightly weak. The trend seemed to enter a flat rotation. I will now record the market situation for the day:</p>

The registration price for this month was 893 yuan, and 897 yuan for November. The afternoon water supplement was the same price, the price of Chijin was increased by two yuan, which was 900.7 yuan. The spot market was calm and there was a lack of transactions. Although there were some to begin with, it was not many. The price of Tianjin goods was increased by 7 yuan, and the price of cooked Chijin was increased by 8.5 yuan. The trend was extremely calm.

Compared with last Saturday, both the pound sterling and the U.S. dollar were stable. The Central Bank's official rates were announced, showing stability for both currencies. The customs gold unit rose by 3%. Public confidence remained steady. Later, due to strong buying interest from banks, the market became tighter. It was learned that the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's official rates showed stability for both pound sterling and U.S. dollar. At this point, the market showed slight fluctuations, with banks slightly favoring pound sterling over gold, and favoring U.S. dollar over gold. The situation was peaceful and lacked significant changes. Although banks were still buying U.S. dollar, the market remained stagnant due to predictions of a reduction in Indian silver by 6 annas.

Subsequently, due to buying orders from Bombay, the market became even tighter. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank also tightened by 0.25.

Therefore, the market remained peaceful afterward, lacking changes.

<h3 id="e201">Yarn and Cotton: Standard Yarn Hit by Third-Grade Products <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market was tight in the morning but fell in the afternoon, with the overall situation being calm. Major players still tended to buy due to actual needs being active. The period is still in peak season. The Eastern African war clouds are spreading, and there are quite a few people with bullish sentiments. In the afternoon, it was heard that Osaka first-grade yarn was falling step by step and rising continuously. It had already risen by about 10 yuan compared to the low price, and there was deep fear of a possible reaction, so it turned downward.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Aftermarket Suddenly Turned Downward</p>
<p>The opening of the standard yarn market was slightly weaker due to the unanimous decline in overseas cotton, with people's hearts being somewhat tired. Near-term contracts fell by 0.50 to 0.60 yuan, but distant-term contracts were seen to be tight and expensive, rising by 0.60 to 0.70 yuan. After the market opened, prices suddenly rose, and the market atmosphere became slightly tense. Because spot yarn transactions continued to be brisk, and the Hunan and Sichuan gangs were quite diligent in purchasing, spot yarn was inherently scarce, and sellers raised prices by 2 yuan, which shocked people's hearts. By the time the market closed, bullish securities dealers had sold out and reversed downward, resulting in each month's contract rising by 0.10 to 0.40 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The market suddenly turned weak after the afternoon opening, with Osaka second-grade yarn falling step by step, and a selling trend emerged. As a result, each month's contract fell by 0.90 to 1.40 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Mingde sold 900 bales, Jinchang 1,000 bales, Hexing 900 bales, Yuan Yi 400 bales, Zou Chang 850 bales, Yongchang 950 bales, Tonghe 600 bales, Dafeng 450 bales, Sen Kang 700 bales, Shen Ji 600 bales, Run Kang 600 bales, and Heng Chang 550 bales. Dafu bought 1,350 bales, Geng Feng 900 bales, Shen Ji 1,250 bales, Ren Feng 550 bales, Chang Feng 2,350 bales, Run Kang 1,250 bales, Yi Chang 1,000 bales, and Yuan Da 600 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Standard Yarn - Highest Price - Lowest Price - Closing Price - Change - Inventory</p>
<p>October - 176.7 - 175.8 - 175.8 - Down 0.60 - 32,500</p>
<p>November - 177.0 - 175.6 - 175.9 - Down 0.80 - 50,000</p>
<p>December - 177.3 - 175.6 - 175.6 - Down 1.00 - 64,100</p>
<p>January - 177.5 - 17.6 - 175.6 - Down 1.00 - 50,00</p>
<p>February - 177.5 - 175.9 - 165.9 - Down 1.00 - 32,600</p>
<p>March - 177.9 - 176.3 - 176.3 - Down 1.10 - 17,150</p>
<p>Total - 246,350</p>
<p>Actual Sales Still Reached Over 2,000 Bales</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales remained brisk. It was found that various gangs bought a total of 2,716 bales throughout the day, with prices rising by 1 to 2 yuan. The purchase amounts of each gang are listed below:</p>
<p>Henan - 306 Sichuan - 800 Fujian - 45 Mainland - 37</p>
<p>Changsha - 650 Nanjing - 15 Shantou - 20 Luzhou - 20</p>

<p>The cotton market, which had been rising for days, now shows signs of a reversal. This is because Indian cotton has fallen sharply, U.S. cotton is also weak, and new cotton is being listed, prices have increased, and supply is abundant. Over 7,000 bales of standard cotton flowers have arrived at the docks, and prices have fallen by 0.50 to 0.60 yuan compared to the previous day. As a result, the bulls of a certain flower firm have sold out, and the market has fallen.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Bull Positions Sell</p>
<p>The opening of the standard cotton market was slightly weak in each month's contract, due to the unanimous decline in the Indian and U.S. cotton markets, and people's hearts were not encouraged, with each contract falling by 0.20 yuan. After the first round, the bulls came to buy again, believing that the seriousness of the Italian-Abyssinian War was conducive to rising cotton prices. By the time the market closed, it suddenly fell back, because standard cotton flowers arrived crowded at the docks, and prices fell by several jiao compared to the previous day. Therefore, the bulls of a certain flower firm sold out in large quantities, resulting in an oversupply, and each month's contract fell by 0.20, 0.30, and 0.40 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. After the afternoon opening, the market situation became more relaxed. Osaka third-grade cotton fell by 0.80 and 0.90 yuan, and it was expected that the U.S. market would fall, and people's spirits were particularly depressed. As a result, each month's contract fell by another 0.15 to 0.25 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Sen Kang sold 1,100 dan, Da Xiang 1,900 dan, Ji Feng 1,500 dan, Da Fu 2,400 dan, Tong Fu 2,400 dan, Da Fu 1,400 dan, Ren Feng 1,400 dan, Tai Chang 1,900 dan, Yi Kang 4,400 dan, Yuan Xing 5,500 dan, Run Kang 3,300 dan, and Xin Heng 2,000 dan. Yong Da bought 2,500 bales, Yuan Da 2,000 dan, Shen Ji 1,900 dan, Yuan Yi 4,200 dan, Yi Chang 1,200, Da Chang 4,000 dan, Chang He 8,000 dan, Da Chang Cheng 1,600 dan, and Jia Cheng 1,300 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e203">Qingdao Japanese Yarn Factory Resolves to Reduce Production <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>The Qingdao Japanese Yarn Factory, due to rural poverty and financial stagnation, is seeking to increase yarn prices and implement free production cuts of 70% or 50%. However, the economic panic still shows no signs of recovery. If the yarn factory industry continues to wait and see, it will inevitably lead to overproduction. Increased inventory will only make capital turnover more difficult. Recently, the industry has decided to expand production cuts to 30% through meetings and has requested instructions from the Japan-China Textile Industry Association headquarters in Osaka. After approval, the gradual implementation will begin. The decision to cut production by 30% is still based on the extreme policy of maintaining the current market price in order to overcome the difficulties of the yarn factory industry.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Grain: Standard Flour Rose Sharply But Fell Quickly <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market initially showed a sharp rise, followed by a sharp fall. The market opened in the morning, due to rising quotations for foreign wheat in Chicago (up 146 points) and Canada (up 34 points). Although the market believed that rumors of currency inflation had subsided, it was not optimistic about the international situation due to rising foreign wheat prices. As a result, speculative buyers outside the industry rushed in, and the price of the current month's contract immediately soared to 7 jiao, the highest record in the near term. The prices of long-term contracts also rose sharply by 3 to 4 jiao. Afterwards, trading was brisk and the market stabilized. When the market opened in the afternoon, it suddenly fell across the board (down 3 to 4 jiao compared to the morning), due to rumors that the pricing of spot foreign wheat was approaching and manufacturers were inquiring. As a result, people's hearts were empty and the market fell sharply. However, such an attack after a high price is inevitable. After a continuous rise, it will be difficult to avoid in the future. In recent days, the outflow of spot flour has become stagnant, which is also a sign of abnormal development.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market was bullish across the board due to rising foreign wheat quotations. At the opening, the prices of all months' contracts were up 3 to 5 points compared to the previous week. As a result, trading was brisk in each session. When the market opened in the afternoon, the long-term situation suddenly wavered, such as the December and January contracts, which fell by about 1 jiao compared to the highest price in the morning. It was rumored that a certain foreign firm had a large amount of foreign wheat that it was trying to sell to factories at a price of 7 jiao and 5 fen. But in terms of the environment, it was just catching the wind, which was difficult to confirm. But the market has been hit by this. The spot wheat market is still stable. Although the inventory is still abundant, customers are strongly selling. The city only opened 500 bags of Zhumadian wheat, priced at 4.1 yuan, second-grade at 1.7 jiao, bought by Xinda.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of each gang was nearly 40, with a total of over 8,000 shi. The sales market on this street was stagnant and did not change, with thick broken rice falling by about 1 jiao. Except for thin broken rice, which continued to be purchased by Qingdao, Yantai, Weihai, and other streets for 700 to 800 bags, the market was still able to see the outer beauty, and the rest depreciated by more than 1 jiao. Ge Yao rice and other types of new thin rice saw a surge in new goods, although there were 700 to 800 bags purchased, the price plummeted by 3 to 4 jiao. Xia Xinhui fell by more than 1 chi, and new top-grade rice of various colors such as Du Yang also fell by 1 to 2. The price of old and new rice did not change much.</p>

The way out for each good, white polished rice was clear and weak, a small number of points to nearly 1 jiao, Dong Xin polished rice was weak and a small amount of 1 jiao, West Xin polished rice was weak and weak, a small amount of 1 or 2 jiao. Thin rice and new port top and various tops were still acceptable, and the price was stable. The price of white Ge Yao was weak, and the price of new Du Top was nearly 1 chi. The absorption of white yuan was flat and the price softened. The rest of the goods also saw a softening trend.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the market situation for foreign rice was due to active consumption by the northern gangs. Although foreign rice was loaded from Jiangxi, Anhui, Ningbo, Beijing, and Jiangbei, the amount of arrivals was not large, and in addition to the smooth sales on this street, it was also bought by the northern gangs. The market was very strong. Foreign rice was being hoarded, and it has been in a difficult situation for a long time. Yesterday, the Tianjin gangs searched particularly hard. Therefore, foreign rice and foreign rice each rose by several jiao to 2 jiao. Throughout the day, 4884 bags of Jiangxi rice, 500 bags of Fujian rice, 214 bags of Wuhu rice, 110 bags of Beijing rice, 300 bags of Jiangbei rice, 800 bags of Saigon rice, 700 bags of Xiaojiao rice, and 230 bags of Siam rice were opened, and were distributed by the northern gangs and this street.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the foreign firm tea market in this city was slightly quiet. European firms are holding a wait-and-see attitude because the East African war has started, the price from Morocco has tightened, and the export of Chinese tea requires war risk insurance, which does not match the tea prices in Shanghai. Yesterday, only Tongfu and Xiehe and other firms bought more than 200 boxes of green tea such as Zhen, tip, needle, and eyebrow tea. The market price fell by 1 to 2 yuan compared to before, and the situation is quite pessimistic.</p>

<p>The price of deformed steel bars has been soaring recently, estimated at more than 100 yuan per ton, higher than before by 20 to 30 yuan. The Shantou gangs are actively purchasing, and local firms are reluctant to sell at lower prices due to concerns that the Italian-Abyssinian War will be difficult to resolve in the short term. Therefore, there are few suppliers and increasing demand, and the market is becoming increasingly excited, which has never been seen before.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the price of main brand nails rose by 1 yuan, opening at 6 yuan per barrel. The reason is also due to the impact of the Italian-Abyssinian War. Both the local and foreign nail gangs were actively purchasing, and the transaction was very prosperous. It is heard that raw materials have been very firm recently, so the profits are unusually good.</p>

<p>The market for black melon seeds has shown no signs of loosening recently. The inventory in the producing areas is extremely low, and there are few goods to collect. Therefore, the market is very tight. Most of the quality goods are waiting and seeing and have not been opened. Yesterday, dozens of bags of Jikui seeds were opened at 19.5 yuan, setting a new high price. The market is still expected to rise sharply. Mingguang seeds were opened at</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw an increase in the price of Dutch coarse white sugar, which boosted confidence. The trend is turning firm. The guild set the price for spot coarse granulated white sugar at $47.40. Re-export goods were quoted at $5.60. Mian Bai sugar from our factory, Zhenyu No. 1, was at $46.60. Nos. 2, 3, and 4 all rose by a dime. At the Sugar Industry Cooperative Company auction, 996 bags of Guangdong Mian Bai No. 1 sold for $17.10; about 100 bags were traded. 2,370 bags of No. 4 sold for $16.90, with 520 bags traded, both up by 1.5 dimes. 1,282 bags of Huizhou coarse white sugar sold for $17.05, all cleared, up by two dimes. 1,780 bags of medium granulated white sugar sold for $16.25, with 1,400 bags traded, up by 1.5 dimes. 2,500 bags of Dutch coarse white sugar sold for $17.30. Those bidding to purchase them in bulk were only allotted 10%, which shows how popular it was, up by one dime. Domestic Mian Chi sugar opened at $13 for 68 bags, up by six dimes. Chaozhou sugar, due to the exchange rate having risen to $1,045, the trend is slightly downward.</p>

<p>Hongjiang Tung Oil has continued to increase in price due to the soaring price of bleached tung oil. A few days ago, Hongjichang and other firms had already increased the price to $34 per barrel, and yesterday and the day before, it was raised again to $34.80. Moreover, there isn't much stock. Yang Hengyuan and Qing Yuanfeng, secondary Hongjiang tung oil sellers, have also raised the price to $18.80. However, the cost of new stock will inevitably be high, and the market still has potential to rise further. However, the autumn sales season has already ended, and there are few outlets. It is heard that merchant stocks are also thinner compared to last autumn, so merchants' minds are even more steadfast. Only due to it being solely for domestic sale, it does not have the strength of bleached tung oil.</p>

<p>The raw soybean oil market is facing a shortage of reserves in this city, and influenced by the situation involving Italy and Abyssinia, it has greatly impacted the Dalian market. The source of supply is inevitably cut off, so sentiment is extremely volatile. Comparing the current market with the conditions being brewed before and after the autumn season, soybean oil has risen by $2.67, and peanut oil has risen by $1.12 temporarily. The public's attention is entirely focused on the rise and fall in Dalian. Therefore, in recent days, the market price has only seen nominal quotes. The "Zheng" number trading house has suspended extending the number two desk due to the Dalian market going up and down erratically. Yesterday, only factory oil saw real transactions; the rest were nominal quotes, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e216">"Fifth Fourth Mold" Correction <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Yesterday, while flipping through Huang Yuansheng's posthumous works, I found the following record in his Confession:</p>
<p>"When I was a student at Nanxun Public School, ... students were talking about revolution, freedom, democracy and the like. We envied the students of Nanyang Public School for their school strike, which was praised by newspapers. We sent a telegram to congratulate them, which read: 'All students of Nanxun Public School congratulate all students of Nanyang Public School on their liberation from the suffering of autocratic schools.' It was printed in large letters and published in the Zhongwai Daily News. We also provoked a dispute with the school over a minor matter and went on strike as a whole, with me as the representative. After the strike, some students went to Shanghai to play, while others went to Nanyang Public School to take the entrance exam. At that time, the Public School was entirely government-run, and I was one of those who took the exam. In the past, I sent telegrams to congratulate others on their liberation from autocracy; now I am abandoning my own school of freedom and seeking a school of autocracy, which is not even obtainable. Without principles, without ideals, without integrity, I have been like this since I was young.</p>
<p>At that time, the student ethos regarded school strikes as a great achievement. After Nanyang Public School initiated it, remote rural areas were all affected. It spread overseas. Japanese students went on strike several times a year, and finally, the student affairs were resolved by suppressing the strike movement. Hu Hanmin was the strongest advocate of suppressing the strike movement, intending to use it as an opportunity for revolution. Wang Jingwei insisted that it was not possible and organized a maintenance association to resist it. Thinking about it now, revolutionaries are just magnified versions of the school strike movement."</p>
<p>This record is also unappealing. He exposes the scars of the student movement at the end of the Qing Dynasty too clearly. But why are student representatives so "without principles, without ideals, without integrity"? The reason deserves deep consideration. That is why I wanted to write the "Fifth Fourth Mold" random thoughts. I think intellectuals are the least reliable. They are certainly good at righteous indignation, but they are also the most likely to sell themselves for personal gain. Liang Qichao praised Yang Du as the most high-spirited young man, but he was the one who placed Yuan Shikai on the emperor's throne. Zhao Xinbo, the leader of the patriotic movement in Shanghai, is now the number one traitor. As Huang Yuansheng himself described, he himself was a student representative who was the first to take the entrance exam for the so-called "autocratic Nanyang Public School." The wandering consciousness of intellectuals is the most terrible. To portray the student representatives of the May Fourth Movement as pure social activists is the most dangerous. Intellectuals themselves will forget their own shadows of decline, and the general public will entrust all movements to intellectuals to lead. The old saying is still true: "Scholars rebel, and they will not succeed in three years." Very few student representatives are willing to serve society from beginning to end! I think we ourselves should admit our mistakes like Huang Yuansheng, expose our own malignant syphilis, and not use nice words to cover it up! Huang Yuansheng also said:</p>
<p>"In the age of science, I had no thoughts of becoming an official. When I was about to graduate as a student studying abroad, the thought of making a living and the so-called thought of loving the country clashed in my mind. From then on, it was a period of constant struggle between reason and desire. Reason did not prevail over desire, so I fell into depravity. Desire did not prevail over reason, so I suffered. The more I suffered, the more I fell into depravity, and the more I fell into depravity, the more I suffered. The two cycled and coexisted, disturbing me endlessly. ... The poison of poison, the ferocity of wild boars and long snakes, is still not as good as the officialdom of China. It kills talents, which is a sharp weapon. Shamelessness, depravity, ignorance, corruption, and all kinds of things are brewed and increased by it. It is a breeding ground for all evils. ... After the revolution, parties and associations were established in large numbers. What I regret most is the prevalence of the buying and selling of people during this period. Rogues of all kinds throughout the country are like pigs and cattle that have been labeled and put on the market. The small ones sell their skin and flesh, and the large ones sell everything, even their hair and bones. Among the three hundred women in the brothels, there are indeed some with charming appearances, but even women with yellow faces and ugly appearances are worth ten thousand dollars, with triple profits. It is like the meat market surging, even diseased pigs and cattle are walking without legs. In recent years, personality has been swept away."</p>

<p>His "sighs of grief" resonate with me. Zhou Liangong recorded that Ruan Dacheng's family's actor, Li, "died in Nanjing, and the actors were scattered in other rooms. The actor Li refused to perform the plays written by Huai Ning at the request of the guests, and he also asked his peers not to perform them. Asked why? He said: 'Even if my father's name is not mentioned, I can't avoid being talked about. Every time I perform his plays, the guests laugh and scold in every way, making people feel annoyed all day long. It is better to refuse and do good.'" Ruan Dacheng served Wei Zhongxian and became Wei's adopted son and godfather, which can be regarded as the most shameless of the literati at the end of the Ming Dynasty. The conduct of a great writer is not as bright and upright as that of an actor. Everyone, think about it, if intellectuals lead social movements, will those movements have good endings?</p>

<p>— Menghua</p>
<p>Ever since I left the deck crowded with passengers (who can be said to be all compatriots who could not make a living in the country), I have been in a state of dizziness and resentment. The strangeness of a foreign country, the abuse of the white race, the equatorial sun, and the depressed mood really made me suffer enough. I did not feel relieved until I left Saigon.</p>
<p>This time, with the help of friends living in Saigon, I finally found a companion to go to Trà Vinh together. He was an old overseas Chinese who went to Siam at the age of eleven, and then from Siam to Java. He only came to Annam eleven years ago. Looking at his graying temples, I guessed he must be over forty. It was much better to have such a companion. On the way, we talked about stories that were like legends, adventure novels, and Tarzan-like stories. Because when he first arrived in Siam, it could be said to be a primitive world, so anyone who went to the tropics risked their lives to make a fortune. And he was also a brave man who risked his life. Does the old man keep shaking his head when he speaks? He seemed overwhelmed with emotion. This is also inevitable. After running around for several decades, others have already become wealthy gentlemen, but he still only has a bamboo basket and a scarf. According to himself, he lost his fortune due to gambling, so he must have made a fortune at least.</p>
<p>I will not forget the night I arrived in Trà Vinh. The tropical sunset was really even more gorgeous. I have seen the sunset over the Yellow River, the sunset over Mount Tai, and the setting sun over Lake Tai, but this place is completely different. The Yellow River is tragic, Mount Tai is far and wide, and you can see the distant and low clouds in the west, and you can also see the darkness in the east, which is a foil for the magnificent fire. Lake Tai, on the other hand, is a vast expanse of water with a colorful cloud floating on it, which is distant and charming. But this place, apart from the towering trees and coconut groves, is hot and empty, and there is also a depressing atmosphere.</p>
<p>The next day, at a little after four o'clock, I joined the unfamiliar team and set off for Sóc Trăng. Sóc Trăng is called one of the six provinces of Annam, but it is actually just a market town in a village, so the surroundings are particularly clean and refreshing, and there is a different flavor compared to Saigon. After arriving at the school, I liked to sit at the door, where I could see the coconut groves, blue sky, and white clouds on the opposite bank. At dusk, the stars were like the tips of needles, too small to get used to seeing, and too bright to get used to seeing. Really, I have arrived in a very different place.</p>

<h3 id="e219">The Story of a Horse (Part 2) <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Shi</p>
<p>On the mountain in early spring, some branches are still bare, some have sprouted green leaves, and some are evergreen, still looking dark green, just not as oily black as in summer. Azaleas have not yet bloomed, but they have also formed small buds. Its hooves felt soft and tender on the delicate grass, although not as thickly felted as in summer. Only the birds, flying freely in the forest, raised their voices and called out vigorously.</p>
<p>Walking around in the forest, the master still refused to get off its back. The gray dog, however, was sniffing around in the bushes, trying to smell out the scent of rabbits or other wild animals. Soon, the dog walked forward sniffing the ground, barking spiritually. The master understood that this meant it had discovered the scent of a wild animal. So the master directed it to follow behind the dog. Walking, walking, turning from this mountain depression to that mountain depression. Sure enough, the dog was searching for a rabbit. The rabbit desperately tried to escape, and the dog chased closely behind. At this time, the master's muscles were tense with joy, as if he saw a large lump of gold rolling in front of him, rolling, about to fall into the sea. He had to fly over and pick it up as quickly as if he were shooting an arrow, otherwise his wealth would be lost forever, and it would be gone without a trace. The master whipped it on its back, and it was excruciatingly painful. So it had to follow the dog quickly, watching from afar as the rabbit frantically fled for its life, running with quick hops. Suddenly, a gunshot rang in its ears, and it couldn't help but jump in fright. It saw the rabbit fall to the ground in response, twitching slightly in the grass. Then the dog nimbly ran over and picked it up, delivering it spiritedly to its master, grunting in its throat. Only the rabbit's bright red blood dripped to the ground, dyeing the green grass crimson.</p>
<p>The horse was chilled by this cruel moment, and then stared blankly at the corpse with its eyes closed, motionless, and at the blood congealed on the grass. It thought: This rabbit, not long ago, it was moving freely in the mountains and forests. It did not invade anyone, it was living without causing harm, eating small grass and tender leaves when it was hungry. Maybe in that stone cave, it also had its home, maybe it still had newborn children waiting for it to return. But ah, before it encountered this disaster, it would not have thought that it would die soon, and it did not want to die! Then why did it have to die? Did it commit a capital crime simply by living without causing harm? Who would pronounce its death sentence? Oh! The master is so greedy, and so savage and cruel! But it really couldn't understand: why was the dog also so cruel? If it is said that the human master is cruel, then isn't the dog also not human? Then it thought: it was not without sin for the innocent death of this rabbit, although it was not it that fired the gun, nor was it itself looking for its tracks, but if it had endured the master's whipping at that time, and had not run so fast, maybe the bullet would not have hit the rabbit's body, maybe it would have had a chance to escape home and meet the children waiting for it.——This kind of self-condemnation made the horse very uncomfortable, it seemed to see the rabbit's eyes wide open in anger demanding its life. It lowered its head in terror, and saw the blood on the grass again, a thick stench piercing the depths of its nose, so it closed its eyelids tightly, as if it were about to faint.</p>
<p>After a while, the horse heard the master laughing heartily, as if he was overjoyed. Obviously, the corpse and blood did not move him in any way. Then he said loudly to the dog:</p>
<p>"Okay, let's do another one. Rabbit meat is very fresh. Take it back, I'll eat it, and I'll give you some to eat."</p>
<p>Sure enough, the dog barked twice more, and joyfully plunged into the bushes, and went to offer his skills to his master again. But soon after, when the dog found the rabbit again, the horse immediately thought: maybe this is the son of the one who was just killed, it came out to look for its mother who had not yet returned, would it have to watch it follow its mother and be brutally killed by the ferocious master? No, I must not let it be like this. With all my strength, I must preserve its free life.——So when the master whipped it again to chase forward, it was angry for justice, it roared, leapt, and used all its strength to throw the master off its back and onto the ground. And it ran forward, caught up with the dog, and trampled the dog hard on the ground, so that it could not get up anyway, so that the poor rabbit could escape, escape to a very far place, escape to its stone cave home.</p>
<p>This, of course, made the master very angry. When it was forced back home by the master, its body had been beaten with many wounds, bleeding, like the blood flowing out of the dead rabbit. It was hungry and thirsty, and the master would not give it water to drink, nor would he give it straw to eat. After being hungry for a long time, it thought how delicious the dry straw would be.</p>
<p>Looking in from the veranda, it saw the master with a white cloth wrapped around his head--that was for the injuries it had caused--chewing on rabbit meat, eating it with relish and oil all over his mouth.</p>
<p>Late at night, the horse was tightly tied in the stable. Still there was not a drop of water or a blade of grass. It was tired, but also tired of thinking. Everything during the day was clearly remembered in its mind. The master's always poisonous treatment of it would not make it forget. This is too obvious: it served the master loyally all its life, but the reward it received was endless whipping. In any case, this small stable was not a place for it to settle down, and at the same time it was no longer willing to submit to the whip to get a few leather strips to eat.</p>
<p>The night was so quiet, not a sound could be heard, like a tomb. The surrounding darkness tightly wrapped it, and there was not even the possibility of free breathing. But it was sure that even though it was old, it would still have to live. It missed how wide and big the world in the mountains and forests was, it missed how bright the spring sun was, it missed how tender and fat the green grass in the fields was, and it missed how smooth the air in the forest was. So it gnawed at the rope that bound its head, its breathing hurried.</p>
<p>After a long time, the tightly bound rope finally broke. Looking out from the small window, the sky was already dawning at this time. The old horse strained and broke through the plank wall of the stable, and then broke through the bamboo fence of the courtyard. It had never been so excited. It forgot its thirst and forgot its hunger. Its whole body was roaring with strength, roaring loudly, shattering the silent sky. In the dim morning light, it jumped and ran into the forest.</p>

<p>— By Emashu, translated by Ren Jun</p>
<p>Her son was congratulated by the people of the town and sent off with lively fanfare, as he went to fulfill his military service—the people of our hometown had to go to a neighboring place to join the army. The old woman made quite a commotion, tearfully following her son for about two li of the road.</p>
<p>Now, only the old woman herself and her husband remained at home. The husband had been bedridden like a cripple for ten years due to his epilepsy.</p>
<p>The old woman's fidelity to this troublesome husband, whose temper had been soured by his chronic illness, had always been well-known. Not only that, but it was also a source of great pride for the old woman. We do not know if she loved her husband. However, at the very least, it is true that she felt the obligation of being a wife from the bottom of her heart. In reality, ten years is by no means a short period of time. During this time, she would work part-time at my home, and would devote all her rest time in the early morning and evening to the care of the patient. And, of course, she would often talk proudly about her fidelity; yet without any complaints. My mother, being deeply sympathetic to this situation, often praised her. At such times, she felt comforted from the bottom of her heart, and tears flowed non-stop.</p>
<p>Although there is a saying that "women are useless things," at the same time they are also the kind of creatures who cannot avoid being sentimental. One evening, a young man working in my factory actually started making advances towards the old woman. Perhaps she was not angry, but the next morning she hurriedly ran to my mother and told her about the young man's misconduct in every detail.</p>
<p>"No matter how useless the patient is, a husband is still a husband. I am also a proper woman with a husband. – I said this while yelling at that guy, isn't that right, Madam!"</p>
<p>"Of course, of course, you are an admirable person. I will also call that guy over and give him a good scolding." Only with great difficulty did my mother persuade her to go back.</p>
<p>Afterward, my mother smiled and said to the people beside her:</p>
<p>"Ah, the old woman is also a woman. Until now, she has never thought about that matter even once..."</p>

<h3 id="e222">The Struggle for Open Doors <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Hang An</p>
<p>What are the world powers fighting for? In a nutshell, it is the open door of colonies and semi-colonies. Originally, due to the result of overproduction, imperialism had only one way to solve its domestic economic problems, and that was to expand outward. Thus, the open door of colonies and semi-colonies became a must-have for them. And the world has become troubled by this matter.</p>
<p>According to a United China News Agency dispatch from Tokyo on the 1st, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is now actively preparing to break the deadlock in Anglo-Japanese diplomacy. When British economic expert Sir Ross visited Japan, he had a series of earnest talks with Foreign Minister Hirota. Ambassador Matsudaira, who returned from London, and Commercial Counselor Matsuyama also held final discussions with Foreign Minister Hirota, deciding to demand that Britain open the doors of its colonies, allow the development of Japanese commerce, and declare to Britain that if Britain cannot open its doors to the world, then please do not shout the slogan of opening the doors of East Asia in the future, and only by allowing Japan to move into British territories can Anglo-Japanese cooperation be implemented in the world.</p>
<p>This is the Anglo-Japanese dispute. What Britain is fighting for is the open door of East Asia, and what Japan is fighting for is the open door of British colonies. The open door of East Asia was originally open. Since September 18th, Britain has gradually been forced out, so it cannot remain silent. As for the open door of British colonies, Japan has recently invaded with a dumping policy. But it has been severely hit due to Britain's resistance. Because of this, Japan is using Britain's desire to restore its rights and interests in the Far East as an opportunity to demand that it open the doors of its territories as a price for exchange. Whether Anglo-Japanese cooperation can succeed in the future depends on whether the two countries' market competition can find a compromise.</p>
<p>According to a Havas dispatch from London on the 1st, the American branch of the International Women's League for Peace and Freedom held a meeting at Conway Hall last night. Ms. Doherty Sertzer gave a speech saying that the United States has recently completed the construction of eighty-six new warships, and the reason is that there will be a day when these warships will be needed in the Far East. This also shows the determination of the United States to fight for the open door in the Far East. The eighty-six new warships that the United States has recently completed are to meet the needs of this action.</p>
<p>Here, we can see the seriousness of the Far East issue. However, what will China, the center of the issue, do with its own open door?</p>
<h3 id="e223">A Trembling Hand <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Ma</p>
<p>Every time, every time, when I suffocatingly crawl down from my cramped and dark attic room, just like a pigeon coop, and slip out the back door into that dim and narrow alley; a withered, banana-peel-colored, trembling hand comes into my view. Slowly, slowly approaching, approaching: moving close to my waist, and then trembling even more fiercely.</p>
<p>This is an old man, a crippled old man with only one leg and one hand left: tattered clothes, a tattered face, tattered yellow hair, already make people immediately feel that this is not a person. But a, a what? I can't say. Like a garbage dump? A garbage dump overflowing with an odor so filthy it makes one want to vomit! However, he is still a life, a human life like myself!</p>
<p>I dare not look at him anymore. The first time that trembling hand moved over, I could still take the coppers for buying steamed buns out of my pocket and give them to him, satisfying his hope. But after that, every time, I also slipped out the back door with a body full of hunger and cold, or still walked back to the house with even more hunger and cold disappointment. The old man's trembling hand could no longer get any favor from me.</p>
<p>Once, it was a morning presenting all the liveliness of a bustling city, but it was quietly drizzling plum rain, blowing a bone-chilling autumn wind. When I, with a gloomy heart, listlessly wandered into that alley, which seemed even gloomier, that trembling hand appeared before my eyes again. This kind of annoying sight almost made me feel angry immediately. I walked with my head down, feeling dejected, but that trembling hand seemed to be connected to me by an invisible thread, still only about a foot away, following, following.</p>
<p>The alley was long and narrow; I quickened my pace a little, but that trembling hand also closely followed my pace. Turning a corner, I stopped, standing there motionless, staring at that</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>drawing of turtles fighting painted with chalk on the wall and the faded advertisement for injecting Salvarsan 606. And the trembling hand was moving closer, almost as if it were going to grab my pocket. Although I knew there was nothing in my pocket, I could no longer calm down, annoyance filled my whole being, I hatefully glared at him—</p>
<p>"What do you want?"</p>
<p>And what answered me was that the hand trembled even more fiercely.</p>
<p>I ignored him; I turned the corner and walked straight towards the back door of my house. Just as my foot was about to step over the threshold; a trembling, weak, tiny sound, almost like the buzzing of a fly, floated into my ear—</p>
<p>"Sir!"</p>
<p>I immediately knew it was that annoying old fellow again. When I turned around to look, that trembling hand appeared in my view again.</p>
<p>I helplessly shook my head, my hand instinctively stuffed into my pocket at this moment, the pocket was empty, only fumbling out a token from the "hot water shop." He looked at my hand holding the token in disappointment, and somehow it started to tremble too.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Nine Plates <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Especially</p>
<p>According to the old custom, I wiped my face and ate a bowl of rice porridge.</p>
<p>Originally, Tie always got up very early, but what about today? I didn't see him come out. In order to hurry on the road, I woke him up from the back room. Something was off; his complexion was not good, eye mucus filling the corners of his eyes, and the smile on his lips was not very natural. Yesterday's diarrhea had made things difficult for him.</p>
<p>I couldn't worry about so much; we still had to set off.</p>
<p>The porter always liked to mingle with us, talking about this and that, telling us many things we had never heard, but today, he also seemed a little unhappy, his mouth closed, his head constantly lowered, as if he were thinking about something. Perhaps, he was not feeling well? I thought, but I didn't feel comfortable asking him.</p>
<p>The mountain road was not felt to be a hardship when walking in our large group. Ten li was nothing rare; in the blink of an eye, we arrived at the entrance of Suosuo Beach, ten li straight from Zhengzhi Street.</p>
<p>"Should we take a boat or walk?" the old porter asked.</p>
<p>"How would we take a boat? How would we walk?"</p>
<p>"If we take a boat, we can row twenty li on the water, starting from here, passing Snake Skin Beach, Coffin Rock, all the way to Xie's Street. If we walk, we can take this mountain path to Xie's Street as well."</p>
<p>"Which is better, taking a boat or walking?" Old Tie asked bluntly.</p>
<p>"That all depends on what the guests prefer; either way is fine."</p>
<p>The bank of the beach water was more than ten feet high; the bank was planted with locust trees. The poisonous sun seemed to scorch the dense thickets. Several cicadas were screeching desperately, not feeling any wind; the air only brought signs of sultry heat.</p>
<p>Casually walking on the bank for a while, the water was so clear, you could see the bottom, the green moss and swimming fish clearly moving before your eyes. The waves, gliding over from the endless end, made me realize that taking a boat would be dangerous against the current, and it would not be convenient for travelers.</p>
<p>After considering it, I decided to give up the idea of taking a boat, raised the banner of the vanguard, and proceeded under the scorching sun.</p>
<p>At first, the porters still revealed a layer of hopeful expressions, telling you in their expressions how much they hoped to adopt the first route, but they didn't dare to say it. In their eyes, how much passionate light was contained! Finally, the light retreated, and a gray gloom fell upon their hearts.</p>
<p>By the time we reached Taigongpu, the sun was already setting a bit. We had a quick meal, filled our stomachs, and saw that it was time to go, but none of the porters could be seen. Thus, we were delayed for twenty or thirty minutes. Later, a porter finally found them from some opium den.</p>
<p>"Something's not right; look at the faces of the two old porters, Lao Zhang and Lao Liu, they look even worse," I said to Tie.</p>
<p>"Why is that? Is it because they had a feast?"</p>
<p>"You're asking me? Who knows."</p>
<p>After setting off, we were all worried, a common understanding arising from the bottom of our hearts, as if something was about to happen and something terrible was about to occur. We were very quiet, not making a sound in our mouths, silently listening to the beating of our hearts.</p>
<p>"Strange, why aren't the porters chanting their jargon either?" A heavy stone pressed on my chest, preventing me from taking a breath.</p>
<p>Roughly estimating that we had passed another five or six li, the trees on the mountain were even denser. If a few people were ambushed, it would not be easy to see. The distance between the stone steps seemed to be a little higher than before, and more corroded.</p>
<p>"Quietly, don't be arrogant, the Nine Plates ahead are very dangerous!" The young porter Liu hurriedly said only this sentence and hurriedly left. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e225">Song of the River <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Ge</p>
<p>The river water rages, the waves like an angry giant stir up the air, hoping to crash against the shore. It crashes against the rocks, shrieking sharply, and then shatters into countless white foam, splashing in the clear morning sky.</p>
<p>Far away along the upper reaches, riding the crest of a wave, a barge rushes over like flying. In front of it, a small sampan is bouncing up and down with the waves. On the sampan stands a young fellow, a piece of black cloth tied around his head, gently fluttering in the breeze, wearing a short black jacket, his two hands hurriedly rowing the oars. From time to time, he raises his head to look at the sky, the soft sunlight making him furrow his brow, and then lowers it to look at the turbulent waves on the river before turning his head to smile at an old man on the barge.</p>
<p>The old man sits leisurely at the stern, holding the rudder, sometimes also raising his head to smile at the young man, and at other times, indulging in sweet memories. The waves violently surge, and the sampan leaps and jumps, the young man busily and hurriedly rowing the oars, then turns his head to the barge again and smiles softly:</p>
<p>"Old man, you're entranced!"</p>
<p>The old man angrily raises his head, gives him a stern look, and then sinks back into beautiful contemplation.</p>
<p>The young man laughs to himself twice, suddenly feeling bored; then he raises his voice, imitating the tone of an adult, and sings loudly in rhythm with his labor:</p>
<p>"The river water surges, the sound of the boat bumping, it's the tide!...</p>
<p>The old man on the boat suddenly coughs loudly, followed by two or three yawns in quick succession. The young man closes his mouth, turns his head, and cunningly laughs loudly: "Old man, you're entranced, you're dazed!"</p>
<p>The old man angrily shouts and waves his hand: "Go to hell!"</p>
<p>The young man smiles contentedly, turns his head, faces the river, and pulls the oars twice, and then continues to sing:</p>
<p>"Waves carry love, the sea buries gold..."</p>
<p>A gust of wind blows close, bringing a general damp chill, the young man opens his mouth wide and yawns a few times, saliva flying into the sky and falling on the river. Then he turns his head again, peering with his rat-like eyes, and shouts at the old man as if provoking him:</p>
<p>"Old man, I say what are you entranced by, how can you be so dull..." The old man this time isn't angry, he smiles amiably:</p>
<p>"Little rascal, be careful or I'll tear out your tongue later!"</p>
<p>The young man puts on a ghostly face, pretends to be anxious, sticks out his tongue, and pats his chest with his hand, saying:</p>
<p>"Oh dear, how can that be! If you tear out my tongue, I won't be able to sing for you, old man..."</p>
<p>The river water rages again, the waves stretch out their tongues, pushing the sampan high and then dropping it down, the young man angrily clenches his teeth and rows the oars with force, then continues to sing:</p>
<p>"The sun sinks on the horizon, old geese encounter cold sounds, but what about the fish?... Hidden deep in the water..."</p>
<p>The old man stands up suddenly, the breeze on the river blows his silver-white beard, he stares blankly with his sharp eyes, looking at the clear morning sky; then he smiles slightly and sits down again.</p>
<p>The young man still wants to sing at the top of his voice, a wave suddenly crashes on his sampan, the sampan starts to sway, he angrily rows the oars, muttering curses. The old man strokes his silver-white beard and shouts loudly:</p>

<p>Songfeng Troupe assistant Cheng Jie is using his old tricks in various troupes again. (Too tactless)</p>
<p>Movie music star Ma Loufen, it is said, will soon leave Yi Hua Company and join Shanghai Yousheng Company. It is also reported that she will join Baidai Company.</p>
<p>A veteran in the broadcasting world, "Long-Legged Mud Horse" (Mr. Ma Tinglong) has not been seen on the radio for a month recently.</p>
<p>The old Yan Yan Society is actively reorganizing internally, and it is said that it will broadcast formal programs soon. (Registered trademark: swallow as a symbol.)</p>
<p>Xinhua News Agency's Xiao Jin and Miss Gu have not returned to Shanghai and have now joined the Hankou Modern Drama Society, broadcasting on the Hankou Broadcasting Station. (The previous report of their return to Shanghai was a misreport. - Editor)</p>
<p>Former Miaoyin Troupe male member Lang Shiguang has recently given up his stage career and is working at the exchange.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Guoxing, the director of song and dance of the Zhang Ruiting Technical Troupe, has now left the troupe and returned to Shanghai. It is said that he plans to join the Tang Yueying Drama Troupe.</p>
<p>Amateur piano sisters Gu Huihong and Jiang Yunyu in the broadcasting world, it is said that they will soon broadcast their debut singing and music program.</p>
<p>Former Xinhua News Agency male member Wang San has now been introduced to the Yeguang Society by harmonica master Liu Di to be Mr. Fan Hualin's teacher.</p>
<p>The Water Disaster Entertainment Broadcasting Conference will open soon. It is said that Zhou Gongjun of the Rose Troupe personally asked Ma Loufen for help and earnestly requested Ms. Ma to ask female movie stars to make guest appearances.</p>
<p>Fatty Qian Dong is honest and reliable, but he is a little too honest with his fiancée, Miss Ni.</p>
<p>One of the three major singers, Miss Wang Manjie, has recently disappeared and there is no news of her whereabouts.</p>
<p>Ningbo Rose Troupe pianist Zhou Menglin is infatuated with Miss Wu Wenying and concocted a story about being run over by a car to deceive others, lying in a hospital in Ningbo (there is no such hospital in Ningbo.)</p>
<p>A certain newspaper in Ningbo launched a singing star convention. Someone impersonated Miss Wang Naixue's name and used the name Huihua to participate in the competition. (Miss Wang should pay special attention to this.)</p>

<p>Former member of the Miaoyin Troupe, Little Sister, is now surprisingly considered a perfect red singing star, and her future is truly limitless. The orchestra of the Era Opera Broadcasting Society, which broadcasts on the Buddhist Radio Station from 6:15 PM to 8:00 PM every day, is impersonating the Egret Society orchestra. Please pay attention, everyone. The Egret Society was founded by amateurs and has not joined any group. The organizer is Mud Horse.</p>
<p>Xi Yu, the follower of Miss Wang Manjie in the broadcasting world, has not been seen to be doing Miss Wang's bidding.</p>
<p>Miss Yu Yueming of Feiyin Society has agreed to Zhou Kejun's joining the old Yan Yan Society.</p>
<p>Recently, a Lingnan Red wrote a poem for Mr. Ma Tinglong. It is now copied here: The road to Remy is a thousand li, Mr. Mud Horse's luck is prosperous; If you ask who is the closest and dearest? The sisters' fragrant names are Lingdi. The above four lines are incomprehensible. (The above is from Xinmin)</p>
<p>Miss Gu Huihong, a well-educated lady, is a graduate of the National Conservatory of Music and has a deep understanding of Chinese and Western music, especially the piano. Her singing voice is clear, bright, and melodious, and she has the reputation of a queen of song. She has repeatedly made guest appearances in the Miaoyin Troupe, and the audience has warmly welcomed her, creating a great sensation. It is recently heard that she has agreed to the invitation of Liu and Ma of the Egret Society and will soon broadcast songs composed by Miss Gu herself. At that time, there will definitely be a grand occasion, adding a unique brilliance to the broadcasting world.</p>
<p>The Egret Society, created by Liu Hong and Ma Tinglong, the leaders of the old Mei Hua Music Association, previously broadcast programs on the Buddhist Voice Station. Recently, it has reorganized its internal structure and is broadly recruiting comrades. It is said that it will broadcast a large-scale patriotic opera on Double Ten Day.</p>
<p>Mr. Er Ma has recently been praising Miss Jiang Yunyu in various newspapers. The content is unknown to outsiders. (The above is from Mo Hong)</p>
<p>Actually, I don't need to have a pointless debate about these two small matters of "Chen Jingfang marrying" and "Zhang Ru's nickname being Caidi," but since Mr. Tonglei is willing to have a round with this weakling, I can only wait respectfully in the booth.</p>
<p>Mr. Tonglei: Here, please pay attention to one more thing. If you have eyes, "Aunt-type" Chen Jingfang, "it is said" has married a ×× boss to be his aunt, "whether it is a fact or not, to be verified." I wonder if Brother Tonglei has noticed the words "it is said" and "whether it is a fact or not, to be verified?" I really feel sorry and pitiful for this rash Brother Tonglei. A dignified man (or perhaps a woman) didn't even see this clearly, so what kind of scolding writing are you doing?</p>
<p>The second point, "Zhang Ru's nickname is Caidi," who among the friends who have worked at the radio station doesn't know everything about the broadcasting ladies? In fact, there are people who don't know, but my experience is like this, I just write down what I happen to think of, what's wrong with that?</p>
<p>Regarding the reason for repeatedly publishing this type of writing, then I can give an example. Can the news on the News Report still be published in the Shen Bao? (Weakling answers Tonglei)</p>
<p>The fundraising for water disasters organized by the wireless broadcasting industry in this city, in addition to the Shanghai Municipal Water Disaster Relief Association soliciting donations from member radio stations, will hold a grand entertainment fair for three days on the 18th, 19th, and 20th of this month. The situation of the handling is summarized as follows.</p>
<p>"Broadcasting Fundraising" Since joining the Shanghai Municipal Water Disaster Relief Association, all radio stations in the city have actively carried out publicity work and agreed that all member radio stations should earnestly request listeners at home and abroad to donate generously in the broadcast programs. As of today, nearly ten thousand yuan has been donated.</p>
<p>"Entertainment to Aid Relief" Radio stations in this city have always been close to the entertainment industry, so after discussion, personnel from various groups were appointed to carry out the work separately. It has now been decided to hold an entertainment conference for three days on the 18th, 19th, and 20th of this month at the Huzhe in Guizhou Road. The programs include a complete series of Shanghai tunes, storytelling, Suzhou beaches, famous ticket series, singing series, and Cantonese songs. Tickets are divided into day and night sessions, and the price of each ticket is divided into one yuan and two yuan. People from all walks of life who purchase tickets, please purchase them from nearby radio stations as soon as possible to avoid regretting it on the day.</p>

<h3 id="e230">"Hero and Beauty" and "Beauty and Hero" <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Mu</p>
<p>Since ancient times, so-called "heroes" have found it difficult to escape the trap of beauty. What's more, the "hero" in our "hero of the times" is such an affectionate and righteous great person? He, Zhao Dexiong (a wealthy man who rose from the benefits of the World War, still crowns martial arts, decorated), met Miss Manli (decorated by Hu, decorated), the only socialite of the era, by chance. From then on, he fell in love at first sight and became very close, no, and even announced that they were living together.</p>
<p>However, the hearts of beauties are mostly false. Although our hero is so obedient to her, the beauty still falls in love with another "hero."</p>
<p>Then, who is this other "hero"? It is Sun Yuzhang (decorated by Wang Nai, decorated), the comprador of a foreign company, a close friend of our "hero." One day, our hero went out to some banquet, and the beauty telegraphed Sun "hero" to come to his residence for a secret meeting. But just as they were getting hot and heavy, our "hero" suddenly returned.</p>
<p>"Ah! Yuzhang, you... doing...". The angry voice our hero made when entering the door.</p>
<p>"Oh... uh..." The squeaky, hesitant answer from Comprador Sun.</p>
<p>"Beauty" then, indifferently lit a cigarette.</p>
<p>Friends! What exactly happened to our "hero"? How exactly will this scene of breaking the vinegar jar progress? Please watch the upcoming release of the Yi Hua Company's grand sound production, Ying Yunwei's painstaking masterpiece "Hero of the Times" to tell you.</p>

<p>— Qian</p>
<p>Tang Jie eats tree bark - Mr. Tang Jie, in "Mr. Wang Goes to the Countryside" returned to his hometown to cultivate. He encountered a drought, and the villagers were in a state of great distress. Yesterday, he photographed the famine victims eating grass roots, followed by tree bark. Mr. Wang's family all ate tree bark to fill their hunger. Mr. Wang couldn't swallow it and was in great pain, it is said.</p>
<p>Cao Xuesong becomes a committee member - In Mr. Wang's friend Xiao Chen's hometown, after the drought, a famine followed. There were dead bodies in the wild, and no surplus food in the rooms. The disaster was serious and the situation was unbearable to witness. The couple Xiao Chen and Cao Xuesong are charitable and very enthusiastic about public welfare. This time, in response to the invitation of the Drought Relief Association, they have been honored to be appointed as members of the relief distribution committee, and will soon arrive in their hometown to distribute relief, it is said.</p>
<p>Zuo Ming goes to the countryside - Zuo Ming, who played the word-splitting gentleman in "Mr. Wang in Secret" and the small loser in "Mr. Wang's New Year", had few scenes, but his acting was excellent. However, because there were few scenes, he was never publicly credited. This time, in "Mr. Wang Goes to the Countryside", there is a role of a friend who flatters, the position in the play is very important. Zuo Ming volunteered to play the role and achieved excellent results. It can be predicted.</p>
<p>Huang Naishuang refuses marriage - Xiao A Yuan Huang Naishuang, played a farm girl in "Mr. Wang Goes to the Countryside", innocent, lively and lovely. The local bully Zhu Dade coveted her beauty, entrusted someone to be a matchmaker, but it was not successful. Then he went to propose marriage himself, but unexpectedly was rejected by Xiao A Yuan. Yesterday, when filming this scene, Huang Naishuang's performance of rejecting the marriage was extremely vivid and lifelike. Viewers praised her endlessly.</p>

<p>"Emerald Horse" is a successful work for which Xu Xinfu has racked his brains. The whole play is full of danger and surprise, and it is the first Chinese sound detective blockbuster. It has now been completed and is expected to cause a sensation on the day of its release.</p>
<p>Shen Xiling's masterpiece after "Nostalgia" is "Boat Girl", which has now been completed. It was recently test-screened at the Central Theater, and the results were excellent. It is expected that its release will definitely refresh the audience's eyes and ears.</p>
<p>The location shooting team of "Peach Blossoms After the Robbery", written by Hong Shen and directed by Zhang Shichuan, returned to Shanghai a few days ago after completing all the work. The stage work is now beginning.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhengqiu's posthumous work "Brothers" is jointly directed by Cheng Bugao and Zheng Xiaoqiu, and work has now begun.</p>
<p>The long-rumored new film "Tuberose" has been staged at the Shanghai Xinguang Theater.</p>

<p>— Zhier</p>
<p>Chen Gong Jiazhen’s "compiled and photographed" collection of movie star photos, the third issue "Bathing Suit Issue," the cover is again "Diao Ban Hua's Bathing Photo." Very beautiful; it seems destined that foes will meet.</p>
<p>Some say: This is Chen Gong's early work (presumably the copper plates were also prepared long ago). If it were now, Chen Gong would certainly not be like this, and Diao Gong would not be either. Is that so?</p>
<p>Mr. Mu Shiying had a "refutation of rumors" in the Social Daily on the 6th, saying that he had only met Wang Ying three times, and the "last time" was when he "secretly fled the gathering"; from pursuing Wang Ying, he concluded: "As for me, in my short twenty-four years of life, I seem not to have easily pursued anyone, nor have I ever had a failed pursuit."</p>
<p>I think Mr. Ye Lingbao should also write a letter refuting the rumor that he never pursued Wang Ying, and publish it somewhere (or write a long article, which may be titled "The Beginning and End of Me and Wang Ying"), because this troublesome and old-fashioned rumor has become more and more widespread recently, and Mr. Mu's "refutation of rumors" also involves Mr. Ye.</p>

<p>Recently, Paramount's export, the film "The Crusades" directed by the great director Cecil B. DeMille, caused a sensation in Shanghai, because of the film's great plot and astonishing cost, so many people rushed to see it. It is now heard that the Movie Star Photo Agency at 138 Nanjing Road, Shanghai, has "The Crusades" stills for sale, with one set containing four sheets, representing the four most exciting scenes in the entire film, each set selling for only one dime, hence the exceptionally brisk sales in recent days. In addition, Shirley Temple's photos are particularly popular, and they are sold at the stationery department of Wing On Company on Nanjing Road, Shanghai.</p>
