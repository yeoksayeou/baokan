<p>— 端</p>
<p>自意阿發生糾紛。海外金融市塲。會一度爲投機家所利用。略起波瀾。然除現金預向較安全區域移動外。近已一切回復常態。卽日後不幸而戰事發生。則目前各國既已多數放棄金本位。歐陸貨幣所受影響。當無前此大戰時之劇烈。至於我國遠處東方。設彼時戰事範圍不大。而東亞又能互保和平。不相凌鑠。國內金融自更不致受甚鉅之影響。且今年來。我國金融因各方維持得力。巳由緊張而趨於和緩。由緩和而趨於安定各地偶或發生局部風潮。類皆旋卽敉平。如如幣制最複雜混亂之四川。近亦。整理就緒。可爲明證。上海爲全國金融中心。上半年竹爲不景氣潮流所激　。略生事故。然以吾人處以鎮靜。金融業本身既應付有方。政府復能從整個金融以謀維護與改進。故雖希冀破壞者有人。從　搗亂者有人。而我金融業之基礎。屹不爲動。轉以經歷一番磨折。加緊金融業之團結。騐之於端節然。秋節亦然。在此兩節以前。無不謠諑粉紜。臨節又無不平安過去。可知造謠者之心勞日拙矣。</p>
<p>我國金融因受經濟侵略之影響。未能健全發展。誠係事實。然我國地廣人眾。設平均每人保有國幣一元。則尚有四萬萬五千萬元。而况金融業年來戒備已深。其不能存在者早已自然淘汰。能存在者必有其存在之力量。金融爲一國命脈所繫。政府固必深切注意。以求應付决。不致操切從事。自貽伊戚。銀錢業爲本身利害所繫。更不肯孤注一擲至於存戶。既與之有密切關係。自亦不願惹起若何變故。遭受損失。在此三方面護特之下。金融業尚不能如磐石之安乎。</p>
<p>所可慮者。有人惟恐我金融業團結一致。無懈可繫難施其技。於是肆其贊鼓。螢惑觀聽。不知者墮其毅中。則其計售矣。吾人爲確保本國市塲計。自應齊一步調。勿信此類讕言。卽遇橫逆。亦應上下一致。沉着應付。不予人以搗亂之機會。此則所望於全國國人者也。</p>

<p>— 吳正德</p>
<p>余被雅片所困。十有四年。爲職務所屬　無由自拔。體質日見孱弱。迄無戒除。之勇氣。而禁令森嚴。實不容徘徊瞻顧。此次乃下决心。置一切職務於不顧。以淸閑之身。實行戒煙。會住宿醫院數天。卒以受不住發癮與遞减之痛苦。乃事半中輟。其間幾次變更方法。如注射。血淸。安眠等。俱爲宿疾作祟而罷。最後乃試服救苦金丹。詎知所得結果。出於意外。先後僅三星期。竟將我十四年影形不離之宿癮。一掃而盡。誠所謂山重冰複疑無路。柳暗花明又一村矣。爰紀其經過如次：</p>
<p>七月二日。開始服救苦金丹。依仿單服法。照常吸煙。自意謂精神必疲困不起。豈知次日興織依然。仍可辦公。連服一星期。煙量巳减去三分之二。日戒煙中。大小便通利。飯量亦佳。先後三星期。共服兩料又四分之一。於不知不覺中。竟得超脫苦海。上月間。得余指導依樣戒除斷癮之親友。已有六人。最奇者。戒絕以後。個個一嗅鴉片紅丸等煙味。卽頭賬心煩。必離開煙室而後已。於以知此丹之奇妙無比。誠稀世之靈丹也。倘能將此稿刊入貴報。使同病者。知所問津。亦美事也。</p>
<p>按：近代戒煙法甚多。如發泡法。抽血戒。安眠戒。變質戒。抗毒戒。雖利弊相乘。有效無效。不一、而足。欲求經濟簡易。毫無痛苦之戒法。首推馮氏斷癮救苦金丹。內服戒法。因救苦金丹。戒煙確有特效。馮氏斷癵「救苦金丹」現由上海白克路大通路口天津峻芝堂發行。每斜僅售一元五角。函購寄費加一。起碼兩料。特爲介紹。</p>

<p>— 美國奧爾珂德女士原著鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>唐恩對於他們那些無聊的見識直嗤之以鼻，並且一路敎他們新遊戲時，口裏咀咒得益發利害。</p>
<p>可是，韜摩還是昏昏欲睡，乃德因為皮酒和紙煙的影響漸覺頭痛，因此沒有一個人在難心學習，牌局就不得精采。燈只留着微光，房間裏幾乎全暗。他們不能高聲笑，又有能多勵，因為賴司務就睏在隔壁的披間，因此大家是懶洋洋，精神振作不起來。有一次正在分牌的時候，唐恩忽然停住，喊道，「是誰？」聲音裏顯出着驚惶的神靑，同時將蔭軍去蓋過那個燈。在黑暗裏一個聲音顫抖地說着，「我找不到　摩，」接着就是一陣跣足的急步聲，從那正房子到那邊廂去了。</p>
<p>「這是小橋！他去呌人去了；立刻縮到被窩裏去，稻摩，也不要說什麽話。」唐恩喊着，隨手掩滅剛才一切作樂的痕跡，開始急急卸去他的衣服，乃德也復如此。</p>
<p>韜摩飛也似地跑到他的房裏，一溜烟鑽進他的被窩裏，於是他祗躺着微笑，直到他的手覺得燒痛，方才發見他還是揑住那根華美的雪茄的蒂頭，原來當那個歡會被　散時，他們也還在吸烟呢。</p>
<p>雪茄的蒂頭差已燒盡了，不過他本還想將這個仔細熄滅，忽然聽見了納綏的聲音，又恐怕假如他把它放在牀裏，他的秘密是要洩漏的，因此他把它一揑，想來已將它完事了，就往牀下一摔。</p>
<p>納綏進來了，後面跟着小橋，他見到　摩安安靜靜躺着，然而臉孔發紅，便顯出驚異之色，小橋撲問他道：</p>
<p>「他剛才不在那裏，我醒了，什麼地方都找他不着。」</p>
<p>納綏也輕也地搖搖他的身體，並問道，並你弄了什麽乘，你這壞小孩？」這更使躺著的人張開他的眼睛，溫良地說道：</p>
<p>「我只跑到乃德的房間請去，向他問一些兒事。去罷，不要來嚕　我不得了的要睡。」</p>
<p>納綏服侍了小橋睡好以後，再去巡視，只見兩個孩子安臥在唐恩的房裏。「一些小小的玩意，」她想道，並目旣沒有見到出了什麽事，她也不去吿訴斐太太，其時斐太太正忙着看護小坦　，心中正好煩悶呢。</p>
<p>韜摩真要睏，他只敎小橋莫多管閒事，不要再喻嘛，後來不到十分鐘已經鼾　大作，夢也想不到他牀下已出了什麽事了。原來那根雪茄並未熄滅，而祇在乾草墊上買著煙，到後來，居然着了火，於是這饑餓的小火焰　蛇行而上，先着了被蓋，遂漸到了被褥，最後那林的本身也着了。那皮酒使韜摩睡得很熟，烟氣又把小橋悶倒了，因此他們惓自睡着，直到火已燒他們的身上，他們已陷入了被火燒死的險境。</p>

<p>— （寄萍）</p>
<p>本刋長篇說部「御香縹緲錄」原著者德齡公主自美來滬的消息，前幾天巳發表過了，我想讀者諸君，對伊的一切，一定會引起好奇心的衝動，恨不能一覩風韻以為快。伊在溝宮隨侍慈禧太后兩年有餘，關於太后的性格，嗜好……等，都不厭求詳的記述下來，愛續「御香縹緲錄」的人，總會佩服伊寫作的能力，遠非常人可及。的確，像伊一僩女流，著述小說有七八部之多，至今還在美國為報紙特約撰述，還要回國搜求小說的材料；那種精神，値得為文人們所嘆服！</p>
<p>昨天午後，我曾訪公主於華懋飯店，頗想帶此材料，敬獻於時者。囚為伊正預備着起程赴平，行色忽忽，所以談的時間很短，要談的話，只得留在下次。我先得介紹伊是怎　的人？一言以蔽之，伊完全是個歐化的女人，言語，服飾，禮貌，都和西洋女人一樣。中等身村，不肥不瘦，約莫四十左右，但面貌依然艷麗，隨時流　溫柔和悅的神情，沒有一點貴族的氣息。</p>
<p>伊說留美時很少看中國報紙，到滬後瀏覽申報，覺得編製，印刷都好，尤其畫報和美國的一樣精美，眞可以代表中國的新開紙了。我吿訴伊：「縹緲錄」刊了一年有餘，記者有非常好感，將來也許印單行本，伊對比十分高興。接着說：離國八年，看看海上風光，已大不相司，此來和許多故舊們頃談，對祖國現狀，頗表同靑。新市中心區也曾到過，充分表現中國人建設的進步。聽說首都氣象一新，此番出北平南下時，當暢游到都的勝跡。總之這幾天中間的游樂，巳有很深印象，證明我在美屢次的播音，為中國宣傳，决不全是騙人的幌子。</p>
<p>最後，伊說下次到滬，當約期細談，準可滿足你下筆的資料，我們就此握手告別。</p>

<p>現們的交通工具，帆船是成了落伍的廢物了；然而在偏僻的城鎭，更遭逢到　殊環境之下，也有需要它的時候；那種雅趣，却非常乘臣艦大輪所能想像得到的；我前次由上海遄歸故里，本來慣嘗三十里的獨輪車滋味，那天曉色糢糊，我已安坐在車上，聽着輪軸壓迫阡陌曲徑發出的吱呀聲，沿途稻畦相錯如繡，桔槹與歌聲酬答着，微風拂衣，正領略得出神，那知瞬息之間！陰雲四布，不旋踵那疾風暴雨如飛將軍般下降，把周身　擊得不可收拾！推車夫和我實在吃不消，便僱了隻「趕鮮」的小帆船，於是我立刻舍陸登卅了；好笑，老天似乎有意尋開心，我們纔揚帆打獎，陽光又向我們隱約的照射；舟子三人，一個老闆，一個小　，一個船夥計，小開把舵，老闆劃獎，夥　登岸牽繩，牛步化般向前行駛；我就想到秋水軒尺牘上兩句句子，「看春水行船，如坐天上，正不知舟中人支持之苦也！「客人除了我以外，還有一位做雜貨生意的，舟子鄭重道：船小河闊，容易傾側，先生們要鎭定不可亂動；我的體重比較另一位客人强，搬過一隻皮箱，纔左右調和，這大槪就是「同舟共濟」吧？</p>
<p>兩岸有溝渠，有木牌，牽繩的舟子，十分艱難，但是他行舟迅速，如猿猱騰踏，眞是一拳不離手曲不離口」的工夫了！直至日將中午，纔趕到一個市集，我們登岸透一回氣，喫了兩碗麵果腹，那爿小茶社　沒有收早市，旁邊坐着一桌市鎭上的茶客，其中一位穿中山裝養小鬍的茶客，　那裏闊論高談，好像新式審視模樣；他們沒有勾留、回到船上，舟子們也在咬大餅充飢，把手　在河心裏抄水解渴；那天黃昏時分，纔到了我們的目的地。</p>

<p>用了那　許多的人力來從事於圖藝的工作，究竟是否値得呢？除此以外，那些太監還有什麽別的用處呢？這兩個問題可不容易答復。但依我想：第一個問題的答復，應該是正號；因為倘沒有這麽許多的人力化費下去，怎能有三千多盆五色絢爛，賞心悅目的菊花開出來呢？何况這些菊花多少總能博取太后幾許歡心，這便是很値得的了！</p>

<p>當我奉了太后的懿旨進宮去充侍從女官的最初幾天，一切起居行動，自然是處處覺得很拘束，很尷尬；而最戚困難的却是洗操的問題。因為我和妹妹久居海外，已養成了一種天天必須洗操的習慣：可惜我在進宮之前，沒有托父親打聽到這一層，以致進了宮之後，第二天早上便深深地感到了不便。我們姊妹兩個輪流着找了半天，在偌大的皇宮內，竟不能找到一套可供洗操用的器具：—也許那些宮女和太監們都各自備着這些東西，但只是私下使用的，而且也不敢將他們自用的取來給我們用。—沒奈何祇得姑且隱忍着。可是我的心上總覺萬分不解，難道說比我們先來的那幾位女官都是終年不洗一次操的嗎？或者可以說，伊們都是凑回家去的時候在家裏洗的，那末還有那隆裕和瑾妃又怎樣呢？（四二〇）</p>

<h3 id="c207">日本的迎神賽會 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>凡是沒有到過日本的人，總不會相信日本人的迷信程度，較我國為深。他們除了每家有家神之外，到處可見石製的地藏菩薩。在鄉村的田岸旁邊茅坑側裏，便可以看見幾個高三尺的石佛。神社規模很大，一區裏有兩三所不等。宛如我國的先賢祠，大約供奉的天皇和日本的列代先賢。方帽子的大學生洋裝西服的紳士，也雙手合十，在那裏致敬和佈施。</p>
<p>每一處神社，都有一定的祭日，前後三天，熱鬧得如我國的廟會。到夜裏沿途都是小販，出售玩具和用品。所以祭日一到，是兒童的快樂日子來了。各家門外掛着圓形的紙燈籠，上面有一簇紙花，由町會派人出來掛的，兩樣東西須收費一元二角。大約一間房子懸掛一盞。門面較大的店誧，便要懸掛兩盞以上。</p>
<p>到祭日這天，神社的殿裏也是燈燭輝煌，門外豎起兩根旗杆，上面縣五色布帶。殿外有五面長幡，紅色的綢上，綉着龍鳳龜麟，中間的一面上綉着五隻蝴蝶樣子，大約是五蝠分壽」了。殿內低垂珠簾，內容不得而知。殿旁有戲台，高僅齊肩，有三個人打鼓吹笛。一個女子穿着白紗的衣服，大紅的襯裙。頭上載着銅箍，頭髮用白紙束成辮子。手裏有時拿錫杖有時拿弓和扇子。按着音樂在台上表演着，默不一聲，大約是娛神的戲劇了。</p>
<p>町會是附近人家組織的民衆團體，管理町內路燈衛生之外，迎神賽會也是重要的工作。在小衖口搭了一隻高台，上面坐着五個人，一個打小鑼，一個人吹笛，其餘多是打鼓，是日本娛神的淸音。看形狀像上海小衖裏的打太平蘸。聽了音樂又像我國素事人家喪亭裏的鼓手，可笑殊甚。空地上搭了麓蓆棚成為賽會的辦公處和禮堂。中間供着白紙寫的神主，供台上兩瓶冬靑葉，銅瓶裏插一尺長的白紙卷，宛如一對白蠟燭。附近商店人家所送的禮物，一尺直徑的人　子，粉紅色的粉食，都放在木製的高脚般裏。禮物中有西瓜黎蘋果，魷魚等等。送現金的將姓名金額，揚示在牆上，情形又和我國相同。蘆棚裏還放着個大銅鼓和一肩神輿；是賽會的重要東西了。</p>
<p>大銅鼓在我國寺院裏都有的，他們下面有架子欄杆和四個輪盤。神輿像我國的香亭，頂上一隻黃銅的鳳凰，亭子角上滿懸銅鈴。彫刻精細，髹着金和黑漆，橋槓很多，平時用木凳架着陳列在神社裏的。亭子裏面空無所有，所抬轎時候，可以任意擺動。此種銅鼓神輿價格甚貴，千元以上，不足為奇。神輿分大小兩種，小的僅三四尺立方，全由十二三歲的小孩拾着，十分有趣。</p>
<p>當賽會的時候，最先一人拿着兩塊木條，擊着指揮前進。還有幾個人拿着，目蓮僧的錫杖，不知是何用意。接着銅鼓來了，幾十個五六歲的小孩，穿了美麗的衣服，一列白色地襪。頭上不是裁着紙頭笠帽，便是紥着顏色布。許多人把銅鼓慢慢的拖着，有一個人打鼓，鼓上打三下，再邊上打三下，如此的循環着。銅鼓的後面是神輿，由二三十個男孩抬着，各人發出「拉！拉！」的呼聲。即神輿並不作直綫進行的，各人均可隨意的東闖西撞，上街走到下街，常有衝進了人家的大門，或是碰倒了行人。尤其是走過熱鬧的市街，除了車馬隨時停止外。有幾個穿白衣的警察。整天的跟着他們監護着。拖銅鼓的女孩子，年紀太小，山母親姊姊領着的也有，走不動的便坐在銅鼓架裏休息。</p>
<p>有人在門口預備了幾桶冷水，候着神輿來的時候，向衆人頭上倒去，於是許多落湯鷄抬着神輿衝來衝去的玩着。有時將神輿上下顚動，好在神輿堅固，並無破壞之虞的。</p>

<p>— 另境</p>
<p>我以為人在最煩惱的時侯，最好去讀歷史。因為你現在所見的現象或自身碰到的事情，歷史上一定早有先例了。所謂太陽照射之下不會有新鮮的玩意兒的，這話至少有十分之九是真理的。不信，請瞧：</p>
<p>史記酈商傳：「商子寄，字況，與呂祿善。及高后崩，大臣欲誅諸呂。呂祿為將軍，軍於北軍，太尉勃不得入北軍，於是乃使入刦酈商，令其子況紿呂碌，呂祿信之，故與出游，而太尉勃乃待入據北軍，遂誅諸呂，是歲商卒，謐為景侯。子寄代侯。天下稱酈況賣交也。」</p>
<p>這是漢朝的史實，太史公似乎頗不以酈況之舉為然，憤然評為賣交。其實這是周勃的狡計要是當日酈況不為所動，他老子未見得一定會被周勃所殺。大概酈況當初見不及此，他僅將親子關係和朋友關係一比較，覺得以一絛朋友的性命來換一條父親的性命總是值得的，因此毅然聽從了周勃的計謀。班固就頗稱許酈況的舉措為「誼存君親」，絕不足訾　的，而蘇東坡　大不以班固之辯為然，請看蘇老的東坡志林云：</p>
<p>「班固有云；『當孝文時，天下以酈寄為賣友。夫賣友者，謂見利而忘義也，若寄父為功臣而又勢刦，摧呂祿以安社稷，誼存君親，可也。』東坡先生曰：『當是時，寄固不得不賣友也，罪在於以功臣子，而與國賊游，且相厚善也。石碏之子厚與州吁游，碏禁之不從，卒殺之，君子無所譏，曰大義滅親。酈商之賢不及石碏，故寄得免於死，古之幸人也，而固又急洗賣友之穢，固之於義陋矣！』」</p>
<p>我以為班固之辯實頗偏袒，綠當日諸呂固為罪大惡極乏國賊，然酈況決見不及此，否則亦不會與之同游，故酈況的動機實只根據一個親子觀念，國家觀念是不存在的，斑固謐為「誼存君親」，自然要引起蘇老的慣憤了。像這種的事情，歷史上並不少，不過其間也有些分別，如酈祝之賣交，乃為勢所迫，還有如晉代王導之賣周覬，乃完全出於誤會，周顗傳云：</p>
<p>「王敦之舉兵也，劉隗勸帝盡除諸王，司空導率　從詣闕請罪，值顓將入，導呼顗謂曰：伯仁，以百口累卿。顓直入不顧。既見帝，言導忠誠，申救甚至，帝納其言，顓喜，飲酒致醉而出。導猶在門，又呼覬，顗不與言，顧左右曰：今年殺諸賊奴，取金印如斗大繫肘。既出，又上表明導，言甚切至。導不知救己，而甚銜之。敦既得志，問導曰：周顗截若思南北之望，當登三司，無所疑也。導不答。又曰：若不登三司，便應令僕邪？又不答。敦日：若不爾，正當誅爾！導又無言。導後料檢中書故事，見顗表，救己殷勤欵主，導執表流梯，悲不自勝，告其諸子曰：吾雖不殺柏仁，伯仁由我而死，幽冥之中，負此良友！」</p>
<p>這是一樁根有名的故事，我們從王導的生平行事中，知道確是出於誤會，故現在一般人還常用王導的那兩句懺悔話，以作為無意問負友的自贖之語。</p>
<p>上邊所述的兩個故事，一則出於勢迫，一則出於誤會，我覺得都還可以求得百分之一的諒解，惟有明代楊善賣章朴的事情，真覺得有些「殺不可恕」的忿念了。</p>
<p>王稌傳：一　受業於方孝孺，時詔毀方孝孺文集，曰：敢有收藏者，與奸惡同罪！有庶吉士章朴喜孝孺文，家藏若干，與友人揚善私言，善借觀，密聞於朝，　怒，戮朴於市，而陞善官，自是天下惻然。」</p>

<p>— 墨嬰</p>
<p>離開巴達維亞是十月里的，照舊那樣炎熱的日子。一部　腳汽車載著兩件淒涼的行李，坐在里邊看著它們一聲不響的是我和根五————一個送行的人。也許覺得這樣的沉默太可怕了，根五就抽出他時常抽的象標香烟，遞給我一支，問開車的爪哇人借了一根洋火，點著了。他的嘴里嘖出一陣灰色的烟霧，在幹燥的天氣里邊一下子消散了。然後，彷彿已經到了非說點什麼話不可的時候，他把吸剩的半截烟支挾在手指縫里，用一種因為工作過度而顯得疲乏的低弱的聲音說道：</p>
<p>「一個人多走幾處地方是有好處的。你的年紀不小了，　　屈著在己城邊沒有什麼更好的機會……咳，不過是……你比門的經驗不夠豐富，路途上應當加倍小心些才是。如果能夠在船上遇到靠得住的人，譬如一個同鄉……」</p>
<p>「是的，我也這樣想。」我說，「根五我度在有點害怕，到生疏的地方去總不太……不太……那里你經已給我介紹了一惆職業：而且也是荷屬地方，上岸什麼的都不麻煩，那就使我安心得多了。」</p>
<p>你安心好了！」根五拍著我的肩勝。</p>
<p>這樣我們又沉默下來。汽車實在蹙腳得可以，在平坦的到海口的柏油路上還不住地搖簸。我的額上滲流著汗水，白光的熱力穿　車蓬，蒸曬著我們的身體。車到海口——丹絨不綠的時候，我全身都差不多濕透了。</p>
<p>距開船時刻沒有多久以前，在艙里邊放好了行李，我們就在這里坐下來。</p>
<p>「你要看好行李，知道麼？」根五說。</p>
<p>「是的。船上的人很雜，應該……」我回答了他，心里想，坐在統舫里，空氣那麼壞，難道挨得下去麼？假如我必需上甲板上去換一口氣怎麼辦呢？</p>
<p>「可是找得到熟人就好了。」根五接著說。</p>
<p>我也那麼希望著意外地有一個朋友在這里出現。我不時用眼情向四面望，或者有人走過身前的時候特別注意到他。還麼著過了半個鐘頭光景，我們所遇到的全是咭咕著爪哇話的爪哇人，穿火襖筒的潮州人，載土耳其式的紅纓帽的孟買人。事實證明了我捫的希望是不能兌現的了：我咬緊牙根，準備飽嘗一次旅行的苦汁，此外還有什麼可做呢？</p>
<p>船上的汽笛子尖銳地吹了起來，一陣騷亂，送行的大都陸續下去了。</p>
<p>「根五，再會吧。」</p>
<p>「再會！到了那里即刻寫信來，知道麼？」</p>
<p>我點著頸。</p>
<p>出了丹絨不綠海口天色已經暗下來了。從統艙里的小圓窗口望出去，一片深藍的海水一高一低地在波動。雖然海上的風是很大的，但是吹不到我們這里來。一股漆的味道和貨艙上衝上來的臭氣教人忍不住要作嘔。電燈光呈著黃色，照著四周的旅客的枯黃的臉，青色的臉。婦人們的頭髮披散著；有的簡直像夜又似地，還淨大那失神的，陷到眼眶里丟了的可怕的眼睛。接著不知道那一個孩子哭起來了，呼天搶地地哭，使人分外覺得煩燥。坐著不舒服，我躺下在硬鐵板上面，一面被舊的蓆子抵禦著它的森冷。我想陲去，這樣我就打發了一夜的時開……</p>
<p>果真不知道在什麼時候睡去了。第二天醒來時船已經離開巴達維亞很遠。拿了臉巾到水龍頭那邊去打算洗一個臉，走開一會總不見得行李就會發生什麼危險吧，便拖著鞋走上去</p>
<p>自來水龍頭那里只有瘦長的，剪了平頭的人在刷牙。早晨的天氣很涼爽，風很大，吹得我行到他的面前時，打了一個寒噤。那個人停住了手，抬起眼睛來看了我一下，用那塗滿了白色的牙膏泡沫的嘴說道：</p>
<p>「很冷麼？」</p>
<p>道地的家鄉話！</p>
<p>這使我驚愕了。我望著這個同鄉，可是非常生疏，好像從來就不會見到過。我　站在那里，忘記了洗臉。</p>
<p>「不洗臉了」？</p>
<p>給提醒以後才彎下身，伸出臉巾到自來水龍頭口去，絞了一會，就揩起臉來。</p>
<p>「你也是××人吧」？我問。</p>
<p>「對了。昨天我早就廳到你在統艙里說著××話，想去招呼你又不好意思。你一個人」？說了，他呷了一口水嗽著嘴，吐到海里去。</p>
<p>「是一個人。你呢」？</p>
<p>「跟你一樣」。他準備走開了。但是又說：「說起來我們是同鄉哩。怎麼你不寂寞麼」？</p>

<p>— 梁啟筠</p>
<p>紫丁香一樣悒鬱味的暮靄，緩援地，淡淡地，從河面上漫騰起來。漸漸兒又向河岸兩邊擴延開去。</p>
<p>白楊樹，灌木林，河岸邊的蘆荻，小橋，古老的城牆，都在模糊的淡灰色里邊，劃著幾道粗野的綫條。從那些東西上面，是可以覺著有一種令人為遲暮而太息的憂怨的情調。</p>
<p>亞珩的小船兒剛滑出橋洞，就給亞基用撐船的長竹竿釣住了。</p>
<p>她搖搖手，輕聲說：</p>
<p>「不要鬧醒了媽媽呀。」</p>
<p>那個只是笑嘻嘻地，……</p>
<p>兩支船并排著走的時候，亞基一路就跳過船來，一把摟住亞珩那豐滿的成熟的身體。</p>
<p>船兒激劇的動　，亞基說話的聲音也抖戰著：</p>
<p>「你——害得，——得我好苦呵。」</p>
<p>艙里，起了轉身的肢喳的聲饗，他手一鬆，她就趁這機會掙脫身，由船頭溜到船尾，由船尾又跳到他的船上。</p>
<p>亞基的心坎里，開著春天的花啦。</p>
<p>黑夜的濃厚的色調加強了。</p>
<p>迷糊的粗綫絛劃成的輪廓，只剩下黑憧憧的陰影。</p>
<p>月高掛在藍黑色天鵝絨一般柔麗的矢空上。星星笑著。河水撫著船沿，低唱著幾乎是聽不出聲音的小夜曲。</p>
<p>兩個兒並肩地坐在船尾上；四隻給陽光灸灼成玫瑰色的大腿，在靜穆的河水里打著圈兒。</p>
<p>「你瞧。」亞基一手摟住亞珩的腰肢；一手指著天邊說。「今晚是七夕哪。那顆亮品晶的織女星，那緊緊貼在旁邊的是——」</p>
<p>「牛郎星麼？」</p>
<p>「呵，是的，你真聰明呢。小姑娘。」</p>
<p>亞基得意了。</p>
<p>亞珩面上的紅暈一直透到耳根。</p>
<p>半響，煩燥的情緒是耐不住沈默的侵蝕的。</p>
<p>亞基開口了。</p>
<p>「亞珩，你媽媽不說我發了財之後，把你嫁給我嗎？」</p>
<p>「不，我媽媽要我嫁給有錢人的。」亞珩鼓著小嘴說。「你也和我們一樣窮，…………」</p>
<p>「可是，………………」</p>
<p>亞基從懷裏掏出兩雙雪白的大銀元。</p>
<p>「我喜歡這。」亞珩一手奪了過去。</p>
<p>「我喜歡你這——」亞基的聲音又打著戰兒了。…………</p>
<p>驀地，亞珩的一長串的笑聲，誘惑得河水也動情起來。小船兒顫抖著身軀，河水溫柔地撫慰著它。</p>
<p>靠著城牆腳下，淩亂地停著幾支小渡船。有一個老太婆，在艙裏探出腦袋來。</p>
<p>「那家的小　子呵，不要臉的東西哪。」</p>
<p>河水低唱著，星星笑著，月照著。</p>
<p>秋夫了。</p>
<p>吹著微涼的秋風，秋風還年青者呢。</p>

<h3 id="c213">為仁濟醫院呼籲 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>報載奮鬥九十一年的上海仁濟醫院，近受社會不景氣的影饗，致經濟遭逢非常的困難。聞去年院中因鑒於維持不易，所有開支，無不力求撙節。但一方面資源短絀，收入減少。他方面求過於供，支出反見增加。因是收支相差，尚缺少二萬餘元。遂使當局頗感無米之炊的痛苦。這事是極值得關心的。</p>
<p>上海有幾個外人創辦的醫院，如仁濟廣仁廣慈婦孺等，它們本慈善為懷，對於一般求治者，不但取費甚廉，有是且免費施醫給藥。其嘉惠平民，可謂至矣。誰不知道，住在上海的窮人，是病不得的。一有疾病，兩三元掛號費的醫生，自然看不起。一兩元一服的藥資，也沒有能力担負。於是一般清貧者與勞工階級，莫不依這些慈善鱟院為健康的保障者。</p>
<p>上海名醫國手多得很，規模宏大，設備完美的醫院，至少也有幾個。但它們大都是一種貴族式的醫生或醫院，祇供少數有錢入的顧問。其醫藥費用的昂貴，以視一些慈善性質的醫院，相差甚遠。例如仁濟聲院，門珍僅收銅元十五枚。住院普通病房一天六角，包括一切食指醫藥等費。施行大手術，則視病家能力所及，酌取微資，赤貧者全部免費。這對於平民，造福實多。</p>
<p>然慈善醫院的經費，皆來自社會各方晨風幫助，近聞上列幾個外人設立的醫院，不但仁濟遭逢經濟的困難。其他各醫院，也因資源短減，陷為無法維持之境。這影饗於大眾的福利，當非輕少。救濟之道，祇有期望社會人士，踴躍資助。這一方面既嘉惠貧民個人，他方面也可為社會造福。蓋疾病的發生，關係於痛人痛苦者小，關係於社會衛生者大。如仁濟醫院，門前病人，年達二十萬人之多，試問這二十萬病人，若沒有仁濟為之診治，任其倒臥呻吟，設某病而能傳染，則社會安寗，不堪問矣。這豈但二十萬平民的健康問周而已。　上海慈善家注意及之，而加以實力的援助。</p>

<p>— 士希</p>
<p>偷偷的，偷偷的，像頭膽怯的鼠兒般地我不在這些角落裏徘徊了。</p>
<p>夜，柔靜得像一潭無波的死水，已是秋深的季侯了。</p>
<p>一個映著淡綠燈光的窗角，尚在幌動著幾個瘦長的人影，一陣低的歌聲在頭看：</p>
<p>「明朝，你這美麗的明朝啊！……」</p>
<p>「明朝」？我低低的喃著「那是在遠著哩」！於是便憤怒起來了，馬路上淒冷著，一縷淡漠的燈光在霎著惺松的血眼。我憤憤的向它凝視著，幌了幌拳頭，嘴裏喃喃的：「明朝？你這鬼！記著是明朝啊！……」</p>
<p>我是感到了這麼地疲備，冷意在晦暗的角落裏自由地，舒散地流蕩著。我輕輕的打著冷顫，「見你底鬼去」！便憤怒地對自己喃著，威骨地用拳頭把自己拍了拍。</p>
<p>拖著悄然的步伐，我又在一個陰暗的角落裏況沒了。一般濃冽的　味，洋溢著過來，我皺了皺眉便兀的站立著了。</p>
<p>「我聽到了一聲低的嘆息，是的，一聲多麼柔弱的嘆息啊」！我心裏想著，定了一定眼便在黑暗中搜索起來。</p>
<p>一堆垃圾。「是的，便是它：洋溢著臭味了的」！我向它怔忡了好一會，才看著在它底旁邊還躺著一個衣服襤縷，贏弱的年青人。他緊縮著，成個蜷虫的姿勢，兩雙枯槁的手掌抱著一個破鐵罐。嘴裹在喃喃的作著夢囈，聲音是那麼柔弱得叫人心顫了哩：「給我點吃的吧！…………」</p>
<p>「見你底鬼去！這兒也是睡的地方」？我憤怒的皺了皺眉：於是便跨近他一步。</p>
<p>他在低低的嘆息著，一會又衰衰的喊著道：「給我點吃的吧！一點點，祇夠塞到牙縫裏也好哩」！說吧又裝著無淚的嗚咽。</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>「還在向那個裝腔作勢哩，媽媽的」！我心想着不禁也冷笑起來。於是便提起脚尖輕輕的在他底屁股上踢了一下，大聲喊道：「媽媽的！見你底鬼去」！他底瘦細的身子輕輕的抖動着便醒了。</p>
<p>「哎！……」他睜着惺忪的睡睛，吃驚地叫着，便準備攫的跳起來，大踏步走開。</p>
<p>我忙把他喝住道：「莫動」！他便馴良地把身子縮緊，輕輕的在顫着。</p>
<p>「見鬼！媽媽的，你在做什麼鳥夢」？我大聲地向他詈罵着，接着便又冷冷的笑起來。</p>
<p>「唉！鬼知道，這是怎麼回事？也許又是夢到有個闊氣的老爺偷偷的在我底手上塞進一塊洋元哩。真的，這些時我老夢到有人給我塊洋元。……但是醒起來什麼也沒有了，沒有了……」他說罷便感傷地垂着頭，偷偷的用着充血的眼睛向我凝定地望着。一會又掉向轉角的路燈霎了雲眼，憤憤的打了個呵欠，躺着便又睡靜了。</p>
<p>我心裏感到陣孤寂的憂鬰，低低的喃着：「見鬼」！便跨開步望晦明的地方踅過去。</p>

<p>— 孟華</p>
<p>最近，我爲着某種偶然的變故，失去了一百多本書。</p>
<p>書籍本來在我是奢侈品的一種，一個連日常的生活都難以解决的人、買書，尤其是買洋收實在是一種過分的欲求。然而在日常的生活中，讀書於我正如喫飯睡覺一樣地需要時，以及你想讀的書，在所謂設備很完全的圖書館裏亦沒法找到時，我就只有千方設法，把在吃飯，穿衣同房錢等項下省下的錢來換得我想讀的書藉了。這中間，我曾由包飯而改爲自己燒飯，由住公寓而改住民房，把大褂穿得稀爛，亦曾竭力戒除了吸烟的嗜好，儘量把錢積蓄下來，這些，目的亦無非想買那些想讀的書吧了。這樣三年來我就買了一百多本書同雜誌，這雖然是少得可憐，但在我總算盡了最大的努力了。</p>
<p>因爲買書機會的難得，我在買書的時候非常小心。當工餘時候，我就抽空向市塲裏或書攤去，想儘量在舊書堆裏尋得我想讀的書，有時候化了三幾個鍾頭找不到一本值得買的書亦是有過的。就是看合了，亦要費一番口舌，跟那些夥計們講價。因此，這些書的獲得，不惟化了我省下的全部金錢，而且亦耗費得我不少精力的。何况還有我的細批與註解呢。</p>
<p>但是，這些心血換來的書，現在却一本亦沒有留下，亦許落在舊書商人的手里，亦許被人撕下來包了花生，說不定亦會擺在公子哥兒們的案頭上作一種不算稀奇的裝飾品，再不然，許早就葬在火堆里了。想到這些，我便說不出的心痛。</p>
<p>記得曾經有位不幸的朋友要我去看看他，還要我給他一點食用的東西。那時我袋子里莫名一文，只得部一把「罪與罰」拿去賣。當舊書店的老板看了看，出了四毛大洋的價錢時，我心裏實在說不出多麼惱怒。後來終於加了一本什麼，才換了一塊錢，把我朋友要的東西買了。要是早知道這些書有這麼一天，我爲什麼不全部賣掉，讓我這受着種種的刑罰的朋友多得點物質上的享受呢？</p>
<p>現在我終於搬到這舉目無親的地方來了。不樓一角，在喧囂的市聲包圍之中。早上排子車碾在石子路上發出來的噠噠的聲音，把我轟醒過來之後，我就開始着黃昏的守候。隣右製羊皮的硝子所味隨着熱風吹來，瀰漫在我這小房間里，叫人難受得要嘔。此外就只有蒼蠅的嗡嗡向送飯夥計的敲門聲而已，我終日無所事事，不是沉在默想的海裏就一味貪讒地讀着裱在墻壁上那些老新聞紙了。要是我這時候有一本書，或是一本雜誌時，這豈不是較之一位要好的朋友更爲可愛嗎？但是我一本書亦沒有！</p>
<p>這樣我的憤慨與痛恨亦就隨着朱書之追憶而增長起來了。</p>
<h3 id="c217">路上 <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 林熙</p>
<p>文指着夕陽邊的方城：「方城到了呢，」在沉在夕照裏的塵埃中，我看到古舊的小敵樓了，心底自然是一陣歡喜。我向文提議，我們要在方城休息一會。肚子實在餓得利害了，走了幾乎十二個鍾頭的路，中間只食過五六個烹鷄子兒。一路便希望着方城早到，好休息一會；而路却總那樣長，沒有頭，沒有尾，高的伸上山坡，低的躺在山坸裏，永是這樣；我們疑心過失了方向，不然計算中的方城爲什麼還不到呢？是塵，是風，是倦累，滿身都是這樣了，也該洗洗風塵歇歇累了。</p>
<p>遙望渴望着早到的方城，我想起一句詩了：飲馬渡秋水，水寒風似刀，平沙日未沒，黯黯見臨洮……一股邊塞征人所有的心情，我有了。</p>
<p>路的兩旁是高粱地，夕陽斜照過來密密濃濃的影子，橫伸得很遠很遠。高粱有的已割了去，剩下桿子還沒有拔，使我想到那是刀槍的行列，而我們也有些像遠征軍了。遠處有人驅逐着麻省：啊！啊！悠麻雀起飛，咭咭嘈嘈，一大羣在高粱頂上轉，也頗好看。</p>
<p>看着方城半塌的古敵樓，心底頗感到些安慈。人到了太寂寞的時候，便是一隻鳥獸，也覺得可親；在空漠的路上趕了幾乎十二小時的路，遇到只是破落的同荘，土黃的頹牆，半枯的柳，多寂寞！雖只是小小的城樓，但那古將軍似的雄姿，在荒原裏似不甘寂寞的屈起，給我的安慰也就不少了。</p>
<p>交這時頗感到興奮，我真佩服他的興緻，他望着樓頭，哼起京戲來了：「…一來是馬稷無勇少才能，二來是將帥不和睦，才失守了街亭……」一直哼到「你不來，來，來，請上樓來聽我扶琴」把我置於另一種想像里。蒼勁的音調，消失在暮色里，我們進了城。</p>
<p>是真累啊，脚下泡已经磨破了。在小茶馆外的土板登上坐下來的時候，全身都感酸懶，大腿更是陣陣痛！想到後面還有長長的四十里路待趕，看看山頭夕陽，真有些不欲再走想念；但青年人的强硬勁還是使得我們要前走。拔起酸麻的腿時，我私自在心底釘下一句話：「寂寞里嚥下個苦在心頭，走，」於是又背着夕陽走出了方城。</p>
<p>看看錶，是六點半，我們已整整走了十二個鐮頭。大槪還有半個鍾頭才黑，我心里想回頭看看，夕陽已走進了山；「我們要在天黑前趕到太平荘」。我說着，隨着加快了步伐。路上極弊，風刮高粱，沙沙作聲，我們的脚步聲也是沙沙的，像有人在後面跟着。夕陽已走進了山，天際有晚霞了；山頭一片接受的夕暉，返照起來，各有不同，頗好看；但我們沒有心情去欣賞，我們還有長長的路待趕。</p>
<p>過太平荘，天已大黑。太平荘太平得不到一絲燈光，零零落落的土房子，在星光下看去有如土堆。沒有人聲，沒有一聲犬吠。夜過村荘，這經騐我有，我聽過燈光從　底射出，我聽過村犬詢問遠來的客人；這些在太平荘都沒有，是出乎我意料之外的，我未見過這樣死的村荘。</p>
<p>死寂使得我們駭怕。我們是看着星走路了。路總是這樣長，沒有頭，沒有尾。我們等待着月亮，日子是陰曆十八，不久是該有月亮上來的了。我們坐在路旁土堆上吸着烟，等月亮趕路。四野寂然，小虫嗞嗞嗚，遂更顯寂寥。遠處：高些的黑影子是樹，低些的是片片的荘稼，更遠就是一片糢糊了。我想着，這大槪是窮鄉僻壤地的最美麗的時候了吧，一切枯死破落的景物，都藏在夜幕下，該是最美麗的時候。若在白天，烈日炎炎，遠看如火在燒，荘稼無論　處，塵高於天，管理車馬的人，滿身塵垢；在烈日下的塵灰里如土虫般地掙扎着，原是這一帶居民的生活寫照！這些在夜里是看不見了。</p>
<p>明月出天山，蒼茫雲海間……看見遠山月色，我憶起小學時學過的古詩歌，蹈着月色，又向前趕。</p>

<h3 id="c226">蒸汽汽車和柴油汽車的新趨勢 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 振民</p>
<p>近年來因為各國的各種汽油引擊極度的發展。汽油消耗量增加的加速率。實在有超乎一切的趨勢。歷年來根據地質學家調查的結果。世界蘊藏的煤油量在漸漸的竭盡。這種統計。當然予汽油汽車前途以重大的打撃。世界的工程師近年來已努力的在研究汽車的新燃料問題。現在試騐成功的。已有酒精，木炭，人造煤抽等等。但是用這種燃料以發動汽車。每有種種的困難和障碍。例如用木炭做燃料時。總難避免時間的延遲。生火和製動等懂難。如　酒精。則同樣會發生製動困難的弊病。至於用人造煤油罷。乃麼鍊製時的設備費用太大。行車起來的經濟問題。就很難解決。在這種艱難的景況下。工程師已漸漸轉移他們的目光。從事於根本的探討。而我們的汽車鼻祖「蒸汽汽車」。已再度的被一般工程師所注意。因為這種汽車有種種的優點和利便。實在是其他車輛所不及。這數年來對於這類車輛設計上的改進。有非常的成績。除掉這「蒸汽汽車」外。尚有被一般工程師所熱烈研究的。就是柴油汽車。現在且把牠們最近的進步和趨勢。分述如下。</p>
<p>（一）蒸汽車的新趨勢　蒸汽汽車的發明。遠在一八七八年間（西曆）。比較任何的汽車為早。當初的設計很簡單。僅有一個汽鍋和汽缸。以及－切的開關。直到西曆一八九五年時。方才有比較週密的計劃。但是速率和一切的設備。仍舊未會改進。這實在是蒸汽汽車的首創時期。近五年來世界工程師對於蒸汽汽車的改進。有着很驚人的成績。所用的蒸汽引擎。係一種最靈巧而最新式的。這種引擊的尺寸為4“×5”。可以直接的連接後軸。不用嚙合子等以資傳遞。因為有恒定的蒸汽懈方。所以在任　車速時。都能有最高的能力。對於引擊的汽門的構造。也有很精密的進步。蒸汽的輸入。可以很精微的調節。鍋爐都係火管式。能够有五百磅以上的壓力。在從前的時候。歐美的－般「士紳」。對於這行動鍋爐。都以為很危險。而加以反對。其實這種觀念是極大的錯誤。因為二十世紀的鍋爐上。裝配着很多的安全設計。更其在這汽車用的鍋爐上。絕對不會發生任何的危險啊。蒸汽汽車最大的優點。就是構造簡單，掣動起來很便利。並且在行駛時。絕無任何鬧聲。燃料的供給可以不依賴煤油。僅用煤和水已足夠。對於經濟方面。當然要便宜得多。同時因為機械構造的簡單。製造的成本很廉。這一切的－切。都是汽油汽車所不能及的。近年來對於車上各機件的改進。有很迅速的趨勢。例如用電制的優良。燃燒爐的精巧。眞孔制動機的高效率等等。車身的極端流綫巳不成問題。據統計結果。美國一九三三年註冊的汽車中。有百分之三·五是蒸汽汽車。一九三四年則為百分之十五。本年份到現在止。蒸汽汽車佔着百分之二十一八。這種增加率的迅速。實在是驚人。預料將來的成績。更有很猛烈的進展啊</p>
<p>（二）柴油汽車的新趨勢因為汽油價格昂貴的緣故。柴油汽車近年來巳經漸慚的在替代汽油汽車。同一汽車如用柴油做燃料。每里的行車費用要減省百分之五六。所以近年來柴抽汽車的發展。異常的迅速。引擎壓縮的增高。使效率格外的高超。柴油汽車的燃料雖然本自煤油。但是因為不須精練。一旦煤油吿乏時。可從煤塊內提鍊出來。此較鍊製汽油要利便且經濟得多。這兩年來美國汽車競賽中。柴油汽車對於速率的增加。有着很顯著的進步。引擎構造的堅强。使壓功格外的來得增加。又因燃料射入器和掣動機械的精巧。使掣動意外的利便。車身的流綫化。更使車形美感而減少空氣的壓力。據統計的結果。柴油引擎的生命。比較汽油引擎來得耐久。這因為設計土和事實土的需要。處目前狀況而論。柴油引擊的價格。比較昂貴一點。但是平均的行車費用。却要便宜得多。在一九三四式的美國汽車裏面。有百分之三十是柴油引擎。德國巳有百分之四十以上。將來的趨勢。也許所有的汽汽油車。都將被這柴油汽車所替代啊。</p>

<p>通用的雪佛蘭通用汽車公司最近完成它一九三五年的第一百萬輛汽車。這完成的時期。較了去年的百輛完成時期要早六十四天。不過據通用公司副總經理克諾遜宣稱。一九三六年的工作程序。比了今年還要擴大而快速哩。關於銷售方面呢。據銷售主任副總經理格蘭德說。明年的銷售數量也要比今年為增加。總之產量兩方面的前途。都是樂觀而向上。一年要勝過一年。今年第一百萬輛的通用汽車。是一輛雪佛蘭的華美市用轎車。在八月開首的辰光。就裝酷竣事而出廠了。去年通用公司的第一百萬輛汽車。直到十月十日纔出廠。所以今年的百輛完成時期。較之去年要快上兩個多月。今年第百萬輛的汽車。其號數在日出五千六百輛的雪佛蘭車中。佔第一千三百八十四號。引擎的號數為五，四太二，一一二號。可是產量數目中。並沒有將奧博爾東。德國製造的別立志運貨汽車。和英國的培德福運貨汽車包括在內。講到一九三六年的市塲開展。克諾遜和格蘭德都有同一的意見。就是目下的平均售價。在明年看上去仍舊要維持現狀的。減削價格難以成為事實。增進售價更其不能實現。這個原因是由於人　和原料的代價。都能保持着平穩。而原料的跌價。也不致成為可能的。又據克諾遜稱。通用公司和其他的汽車製造公司一樣。竭力在增進和擴充他們的工廠。通用對於這件工作所需。而現在正在用的金錢。達美金三五·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元。眞是一個偉大的數目嗶。</p>
<p>福特的V八式　第二百萬輛的V八式福特——不到十二個月時期中所完成的第百萬輛福特。和約數為二三，〇〇〇，〇〇〇輛的福特——於本年七月十三日在福特汽車公司的羅琪廠完成。福特廠的創業人享利福特。和福特汽車公司總理愛特賽爾福特。都目覩着這個具有歷史價値的福特最後裝配完成，這輛第二百萬輛的福特。一經出廠之後。便開始它的二千七百英里長途旅行。直放聖底谷，加利福尼亞。在那里這輛汽車。便陳列在加州太平洋萬國展覽會中的福特陳列塲中。自從一九三四年六月十九日。福特廠完成了第百萬輛福特以來。在不滿一年的時期中。完成了另一個百萬輛。這是應騐了去年底福特氏所說的。就是福特汽車公司「要在一九三五年中超過百萬　的產額」。這一輛第二，〇〇〇，〇〇〇號V八式福特。是第四輛橫斷大陸的歷史上的福特。這四輛汽車。在大西洋和太平洋兩岸之間。都曾在四大幹路之中的一路。做過宣揚的工作。最早推算到一九〇九年。一輛T式福特。那時候是輛汽車界的新進者。而不久便注定了成為最著名的汽車。從紐約長征到西亞圖。在終止於阿拉斯加猶康太平洋展覽會的橫斷太陸車賽中。獲得格勸哈姆獎章。福特氏對於獲槳的那輛汽車。在終點時。親加祝頌。第二輛歷史上的福特。屬於第一〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇號，又是一輛T型的。一九二四年完成出了哈蘭派克廠後。便從紐約經過林肯大道直放舊金山。第三輛俱有歷史價値的。是一輛A型車。屬於二〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇號。一九三一年時在羅琪廠完成。到紐約之後。再從那里到樂士安極立斯和舊金山。第四輛的歷史紀錄福特。是第一，〇〇〇，〇〇〇號V八式福特。去年六月十九日在羅琪廠完成·開到支加哥之後。便陳列在百年進步展覽會中的福特陳列塲中。</p>

<h3 id="e24">Prospects for the Financial Industry <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>— End</p>
<p>Since the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, the overseas financial market has been exploited by speculators to some extent, causing slight disturbances. However, apart from cash reserves moving towards safer regions, everything has mostly returned to normal. Even if war unfortunately breaks out in the future, since most countries have already abandoned the gold standard, the impact on European currencies should not be as severe as during the previous war. As for our country, which is far away in the East, if the scope of the war is not large at that time and East Asia can mutually ensure peace and not encroach on each other, the domestic finance will naturally not be greatly affected. Moreover, this year, due to effective maintenance by all parties, our country's finance has transitioned from tension to moderation and from moderation to stability. Localized disturbances occasionally occur in various places, but they are all quickly quelled, as evidenced by the recent settling of the complex and chaotic currency system in Sichuan. Shanghai is the financial center of the country. In the first half of the year, it was slightly affected by the wave of economic recession. However, because we handled it calmly, the financial industry itself responded effectively, and the government was able to maintain and improve the entire financial system, even though there were those who hoped to destroy it and those who stirred up trouble, the foundation of our financial industry remained unshaken. The unity of the financial industry has been strengthened through a period of adversity, as seen during the Dragon Boat Festival and the Mid-Autumn Festival. Before these two festivals, rumors were rampant, but the festivals passed peacefully. This shows that the efforts of the rumor-mongers are becoming increasingly futile.</p>
<p>The fact that our country's finance has failed to develop soundly due to the impact of economic aggression is true. However, our country has a vast territory and a large population. If each person holds an average of one yuan in national currency, there would still be 450 million yuan. Moreover, the financial industry has been deeply vigilant in recent years. Those that cannot survive have already been naturally eliminated, and those that can survive must have the strength to survive. Finance is tied to the lifeline of a country, and the government must pay close attention to it in order to respond decisively and not act rashly and create trouble for itself. The silver and money industry is tied to its own interests and will not make a reckless bet. As for depositors, since they have a close relationship with it, they also do not want to cause any changes and suffer losses. With protection from these three aspects, can't the financial industry be as stable as a rock?</p>
<p>What is concerning is that some people fear that our financial industry will be united and invulnerable, making it difficult to use their tricks. Therefore, they go all out to instigate and deceive the public. Those who are unaware fall into their traps, and their plan will succeed. In order to secure our domestic market, we should move in unison and not believe such slanderous words. Even in the face of adversity, we should respond calmly and consistently from top to bottom, not giving people an opportunity to stir up trouble. This is what is expected of the people of the country.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the content of the British government's notification to the Japanese government about convening a disarmament conference this year, it broadly stated that Britain intends to convene a naval and heavy arms reduction conference this year to discuss the declaration on warship construction and the qualitative limitation proposals. France, Italy, and the United States have already agreed to the meeting. If Japan agrees to this, a formal meeting can be held within this year. Whether Japan has room for consideration regarding this point, and how subsequent circumstances might change, please promptly communicate your intentions.

<p>(London) At a meeting held last night by the American branch of the International Women's League for Peace and Freedom at Conway Hall here, Ms. Du He Sedertziel delivered a speech stating that 86 new U.S. warships have recently been completed because there will be a day when these warships are needed in the Far East. The United States itself also has an "Abyssinian problem," the only difference being that it is called "Manchukuo" instead of Abyssinia. The main direction of American foreign policy is that China, with its 400 million people, will inevitably become the world's largest market in the future, and no country can exclusively occupy it; otherwise, the United States will certainly come out to oppose it. In view of this situation, the United States is actively building warships. Last year, the total U.S. income reached $3,000,000,000, while its military expenditure has reached a massive $4,000,000,000. (1st, Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>(Manila) Quezon, the president-elect of the Philippine Commonwealth, announced his policy guidelines today, stating that the purpose of the new government is to do more and talk less. The constitutional provision that the Philippine president cannot serve consecutive terms is what I advocate. Its intention is to make the president the head of the government, a servant of the people, and not a tool of political parties. Quezon also stated that he will strictly adhere to this commitment when appointing the cabinet in the future and will prioritize talent. Quezon expressed optimism regarding public security and financial stability. As for the new government's attitude towards industry, it will actively assist like the major European powers and Japan, and will not remain uninvolved like the United States. The reason is that the Philippine industry lacks capital for development, and government assistance is indeed necessary. However, this will also be done prudently. Speaking of national defense, Quezon believes it is the only issue that requires the use of the national treasury. As for the issue of joining the League of Nations, Quezon has the right to have the Philippines join, but this requires the permission of the United States. (30th, National News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to news from the State Department and the Japanese Embassy today, the allocation of the Philippine cotton textile market between the United States and Japan is about to be compromised within this week.

Therefore, the U.S. State Department's suggestion to Japan this time is actually the greatest concession to Japan. (30th, National News Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>—Flood Control and Irrigation— President Attends Ceremony and Delivers Speech Defending Public Works Policy</p>
<p>Boulder City President Roosevelt participated in the completion ceremony of the Boulder Dam project here today and delivered a speech defending his public works policy, pointing out that it is a tool for launching the industrial mechanism. President Roosevelt also issued a warning, stating that private businesses must bear the responsibility for maintaining and increasing employment. The government's credit is now stronger than at any time in the past six years. This dam is one of the greatest achievements in engineering history. This dam has created the world's largest artificial lake, 115 miles long, protecting the Imperial Valley from floods and providing irrigation to a vast area, while generating enormous amounts of electricity. It is estimated that the income from sales will be sufficient to repay the massive sum of 165 million yuan advanced by the government. According to reports, the Boulder Canyon Project Act was passed by Congress in late December 1928. Its location is between Arizona and Nevada, with the Colorado River as the boundary between the two states. After the dam is built, the river's water level will slightly increase by 582 feet. This dam is approximately 750 feet high, making it the highest in the world, with a water storage capacity of 30.5 million acre-feet. The dam crest is 1,180 feet long, 45 feet wide at the top, and 650 feet wide at the bottom. It used a total of 4.4 million cubic yards of cement, requiring approximately 5.5 million barrels of cement. This dam stores the surplus water of the Colorado River, providing irrigation for farmland and regulating the river to facilitate navigation, while protecting the fields in the Imperial Valley of Southern California from the harm of floods, water shortages, and siltation. A lake approximately 115 miles long has formed behind the dam, covering an area of 145,000 acres. This is truly the largest reservoir in the world. The cement construction of the dam was completed this spring, but there is still much work to be done on the construction of the power plant and the installation of hydroelectric generators. The estimated horsepower is a minimum of 1.835 million horsepower. (30th, Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>Due to Lack of Airfields and Language Barriers</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Abyssinian king applied to the League of Nations to send observers to Abyssinia to monitor everything in the event of disputes or aggression. The League of Nations commissioned three experts to consider this request. Their work has not yet been completed, but they are preparing to submit a report to the meeting of the Committee of Thirty-Three on Thursday. The opinions of French explorer Griaule are being sought. The general consensus is that it is necessary to find an airfield suitable for aircraft landing, and aviators who speak the Abyssinian language, and to enable them to fly to the scene of the incident in a short time. This question is extremely difficult to resolve, so it is expected that the two experts will not approve the proposal to send this committee to Abyssinia.

If Abyssinia sends a telegram, it will be considered confirmation of this matter. The League of Nations should first determine whether the troop movements are preparations for an attack, or whether it is an accomplished fact of aggression. Judging from recent telegrams from East Africa, the military actions in East Africa belong to the former.

Asmara is due north of Adwa and the Abyssinian capital, about 75 miles from the site of the Italian army's defeat in 1896, and about 450 miles from the Abyssinian capital. Assab is located about 400 miles northeast of the Abyssinian capital. If the Italian army attacks from two sides at the same time, assuming that Asmara is at the 12 o'clock position, it will be one at 12 o'clock, one at 2 o'clock, and one at 5 o'clock.

<p>Pro and Con Factions Stand in Opposition</p>
<p>(London) At the Labour Party conference held in Brighton today, there was a fierce debate over the Executive Committee's recommendation to support the League of Nations' implementation of sanctions against Italy when a war occurs in East Africa. The pro and con factions were at odds with each other, and the situation was turbulent. After former Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Dalton moved to pass the resolution, Sir Stafford Cripps immediately stood up to oppose it, saying that the great driving force behind the British government at the moment is the interests of capitalists. Economic sanctions cannot be distinguished from military sanctions. Or there are those who hold the theory that Mussolini should be overthrown. It should be known that Mussolini cannot be overthrown. Mussolini will probably make a satisfactory transaction with his fellow members in the "International Transactions Association." Even if those fellows temporarily act as police, it will not hinder them. Cripps then vehemently criticized the capitalists, his words were extremely激昂. After Cripps finished speaking, National Union of Railwaymen Secretary Marchbank rose to support the resolution and also strongly attacked Cripps, saying that Cripps' behavior was self-contradictory. During the recent House of Commons discussion of the Sino-Japanese dispute, Cripps supported the implementation of sanctions against Japan. If the sanctions at that time were正当, then today's sanctions are also正当. Those who do not support the party议者 can leave the meeting, and there is no晓晓晓为也. As soon as this statement came out, there were frantic shouts of "Shameful!" "Sanctions will destroy the party!" in the assembly, followed by the noise of the crowd. Then Marchbank happily left the altar. (1st, Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>This Trip Was To Inspect Achievements in New Germany, Not For Any Mysterious Purpose</p>
<p>(Berlin) General Gömbös, the Hungarian Prime Minister who is currently visiting Germany, recently made a statement to a Havas News Agency reporter stationed in Berlin, stating, "My visit to Germany this time is not for any mysterious purpose. All kinds of rumors from the outside world are purely fictitious and not credible. It is common for those who bear the responsibility of national politics to visit foreign capitals. I have visited Rome four times and frequently visited Vienna. As for visiting Germany, this is only the first time since the National Socialist Party came to power. Although the situation of my rule in Hungary is very different from the current situation in Germany, I am confident that I am a right-wing politician. Therefore, I am very interested in and impressed by the achievements of the new German government in the past two years. From my observations, the domestic situation in Germany has become greatly stable. I came to Germany by plane this time, and the weather was bad. Some of you may think that I came to sign a sky agreement, which is an overreach." In addition, people around Manager Gömbös also told the Havas News Agency reporter that in recent days, Manager Gömbös has not signed any agreements of any nature with Germany. Everyone should know that Prime Minister Gömbös was invited by Prussian Prime Minister Göring to come to Germany for hunting. With elk in front, how can he care about other things? As for the talks in Berlin, they were only to probe for information. When Gömbös spoke with Führer Hitler, Foreign Minister Neurath was not present, which further proves that this conversation did not have a diplomatic nature. As for the rumor that Germany, Poland, and Hungary are organizing an anti-Russian united front, there is no basis for it. You should know that we have always maintained good relations with the Soviet Union. For fifteen years, Hungarian policy has been not to form alliances with any country, nor to oppose any country. There is no reason for our country to change this attitude at present. As for the military agreement established between the Soviet Union, Romania, and Czechoslovakia, we believe that it will not cause any major changes to the current European order."

<p>Findings of German Deputy Aviation Minister's Inspection</p>
<p>Capital of Hungary, Deputy Minister of the German Aviation Department, Mr. Milch, came here a few days ago to visit the Hungarian aviation authorities. The current status of the Hungarian aviation industry has therefore become clear. According to the Treaty of Trianon with Hungary in 1919, Hungary was prohibited from possessing military aircraft. However, in fact, an aviation department has been attached to the Hungarian Ministry of Commerce. All civil servants in the department are soldiers and wear uniforms. Aviation authorities have also been established in the capital of Hungary, so that when the time is right, Hungary can immediately become a strong aviation nation. The internal organization of the agency is complete. In addition to the aviation agency in the capital, there are also nine airfields in the country, all of which have hangars for aircraft to rest. The locations of the airfields are connected to the military regions of Hungary. There are a large number of Hungarian aviation personnel, but because there are very few military aircraft, most aviation personnel fly civilian aircraft to practice aviation technology. In the future, if Hungary obtains the freedom to build military aircraft, how to purchase a large number of aircraft materials will become a problem. It is expected that at that time, Hungary will ask countries with closer political and economic relations with Hungary to provide loans for Hungary to purchase materials. (Havas Dispatch, 1st)</p>

<h3 id="e48">My Experience With Quitting Opium <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Zhengde</p>
<p>I was trapped by opium for fourteen years. Because of my job, I had no way to break free. My physique became weaker day by day, and I never had the courage to quit. But the strict prohibitions did not allow me to hesitate and look around. This time, I made up my mind to put aside all my duties and quit opium in a leisurely manner. I stayed in the hospital for a few days, but I couldn't stand the pain of craving and tapering down, so I gave up halfway. During that time, I changed methods several times, such as injections, serum, and sleeping pills, but all failed due to the recurrence of old illnesses. Finally, I tried taking Jiuku Jindan (Golden Pill for Saving from Suffering). Unexpectedly, the results were beyond expectations. In just three weeks, I completely swept away my fourteen-year addiction. It is truly said that "mountains upon mountains, ice upon ice, you doubt there is no road; willows dark, flowers bright, another village appears." I hereby record my experience as follows:</p>
<p>July 2nd. I started taking Jiuku Jindan. Following the instructions on the leaflet, I smoked as usual. I thought my spirit would be exhausted and I wouldn't be able to get up. Unexpectedly, the next day, I was still energetic and could still work. After taking it for a week, my smoking amount had decreased by two-thirds. While quitting opium, my bowel movements were smooth and my appetite was good. After three weeks, I took a total of two portions and a quarter. Unknowingly, I was able to escape the sea of suffering. Last month, I guided six relatives and friends to quit in the same way. The most amazing thing is that after quitting, everyone who smelled the smoke of opium pills, etc., immediately felt dizzy and irritated and had to leave the smoking room. From this, I know that this pill is incomparably wonderful and is truly a rare elixir. If this manuscript can be published in your newspaper, so that those who suffer from the same illness can know where to seek help, it would also be a good thing.</p>
<p>Note: There are many modern methods of quitting opium, such as the blistering method, bloodletting, sleeping pills, alteration, and antitoxin methods. Although there are pros and cons, the effectiveness varies. If you want an economical, simple, and painless method of quitting, the first choice is Feng's Jiuku Jindan. Because Jiuku Jindan is indeed effective in quitting opium, Feng's Jiuku Jindan is now distributed by Tianjin Junzhitang at the intersection of Baike Road and Datong Road in Shanghai. Each portion only costs 1.5 yuan. Please add 1 yuan for postage for mail orders. A minimum of two portions is required. We hereby introduce it.</p>

<p>Memel: Yesterday, after the government ordered the extension of voting hours, voting continued today from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. The handling of this matter in the inland areas was actually faster than in this city. In some areas, the ballot boxes were sealed by the afternoon. About 95% of citizens participated in the vote. There were no new incidents throughout the day. Although the National Socialist Party (Einheitsfront) mobilized the municipal rescue team to carry all the disabled people in the city to the polling stations, demanding that they be given priority in voting, hoping to crowd the office, their plan was not sold. At that time, the crowd was quite anxious because they had been waiting for a long time and had not been able to vote. However, the German radio station still broadcast false news and threatening words every two hours to confuse people. But it was also said that the future of the Memel region will not change due to the results of this election. (Havas Dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Memel: The second day of the Memel parliamentary elections passed peacefully. Newspaper reporters who inspected the polling places were very popular with the people. The general public held pro-German demonstrations under the watchful eyes of the Lithuanian police, which shows that the public was not under the political oppression of the Lithuanian authorities. The strength of the pro-German sentiment in the Memel region can also be seen from this. The sudden arrival of German Führer Hitler and Army Minister von Blomberg in Königsberg has aroused general speculation. It is rumored that Hitler will deliver an important speech tomorrow in Tilsit, on the German side of the Memel River, but this statement has not been confirmed by the official field.

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Communications issued 10 million yuan of 24th year telecommunications government bonds, half to complete the necessary important facilities and half to repay old debts. Although the total number is 10 million, it is difficult to predict how the sales will be. The actual revenue, calculated at only 60% of the current loan from the silver community, is approximately 6 million yuan. In the past, the Ministry borrowed cash from institutions such as the Sino-British Gengkuan Board to carry out various telecommunications projects, such as the long-distance telephone in nine provinces. The Ministry intends to use a portion of the bond funds to repay this, with the repayment amount needing more than 3 million. Therefore, the remaining cash is only more than 2 million. The use of the remaining funds has not yet been decided. The telecommunications matters to be handled now, such as the telecommunications network in Sichuan and the telephone in Chengdu, are all intended to be used for these funds. The Ministry previously planned to build a large building in Shanghai, which requires a large amount of funding and is not easy to raise. It has been decided to postpone it temporarily. The rumor that the telecommunications bond funds will be allocated for this construction fee is not true. (Special Dispatch, 1st)</p>

<h3 id="e99">Wang Kemin Discusses Huang Fu's Firm Resignation <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Huang's Condition Has Recovered and He Plans to Go to Shanghai in the Coming Days</p>
<p>Hangzhou Correspondence: Wang Kemin, the former Acting Chairman of the Beiping Political Readjustment Committee, arrived in Hangzhou with his wife and daughter on the afternoon of the 28th. He rested at the Bank of China villa on Shengtang Road. In the evening, he was feted by Jin Runquan, the manager of the Hangzhou branch of the Bank of China, and then stayed at the Bank of China villa. At 8:00 a.m. on the 29th, he and Yu Jiaji, the former secretary-general of the Beiping Political Readjustment Committee, took a car to Mogan Mountain to meet Huang Fu, reporting on the conclusion of the Beiping Political Readjustment Committee. In the afternoon, he returned to Hangzhou from Mogan Mountain at 5:30 p.m. In the evening, Mayor Zhou Xiangxian of Hangzhou specially held a banquet at Lou Wai Lou on West Lake for Wang and his wife, as well as Cheng Tianfang, the newly appointed ambassador to Germany, and his wife, who came to Hangzhou for sightseeing. Those present to accompany them included Xu Qingfu, Jin Runquan, and Yu Shaosong. The gathering broke up at 9:00 p.m. Yesterday (1st) at 8:00 a.m., Wang and his wife went to Battery Hill and Liuxia and other places to sweep the graves and search for a burial site for his wife. It was decided that Wang's wife will govern the funeral affairs, staying for half a month, and then transport the coffin south for burial. According to Wang, he went to Mogan Mountain yesterday to meet Huang Yingbai to report on the conclusion of the Beiping Political Readjustment Committee. Huang's illness has greatly recovered, but his nasal breathing is not yet fully clear, and his left arm can move quite freely and can untie the buckles under his ribs himself. Huang expressed his intention to go down the mountain to Shanghai in the coming days, perhaps to have a medical check-up. His intention to resign from the position of Minister of Interior is still firm, and he has no intention of taking office. The reporter also visited Yu Jiaji at Room 42 of the Xinxin Hotel and inquired about the current situation in North China. According to him, after the conclusion of the Beiping Political Readjustment Committee, the foreign affairs of Hebei, those concerning local matters are the responsibility of the provincial government, and major matters are handled directly by the central government. The current situation in North China is good. If the local authorities handle matters properly, branch problems may not arise. The counties in the war zone are the responsibility of the commissioners of Ji and Mi and the county magistrates, because Koreans and Chinese live together, making it more difficult to deal with. The Hebei Economic Association is organized by people from the business and banking sectors and is planning to improve and adjust the local economy. Government personnel have not participated. Mr. Shulu's future whereabouts are uncertain. After Song Zheyuan took office as the commander of the Tianjin Garrison, he had harmonious relations with all parties, and there were no problems with local appeals. He met with He Yingqin many times in Nanjing, but his return to the north is not yet scheduled. He has not had time to return to his hometown for four years. This time, he took time to come to Hangzhou and will return to his original residence in Shaoxing to take care of personal matters, staying for a day or two, and then go to Shanghai, pass through Nanjing, and return to the north. President Wang entrusted Mr. Wang Shulu to urge Mr. Huang Yingbai to go to Nanjing as soon as possible to take up the position of Minister of Interior, but Huang still intends to rest for a while, and there is no preparation for taking office at present.

<p>Daily Output of Fifteen Tons</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since Guangdong Province implemented the Three-Year Administrative Plan, it has built 24 major factories to actively develop industry.

The director of the factory is Huang Bingfang, who studied chemistry in the United States and is very experienced. Therefore, the factory's products have achieved excellent results. They have been repeatedly tested by various chemists, all of whom believe that the quality is pure and comparable to imported products. The price is more than half lower than imported products, so industrial manufacturers are happy to purchase them. The current daily output is 15 tons, and the monthly output is 450 tons. In the year since its establishment, it has produced more than 10,000 tons. In addition, the Guangdong Textile Factory's adjacent fertilizer factory has been established one after another, and the paper mill is also in preparation. Sulfuric acid has a wider range of uses, and the factory is actively planning to expand and increase production to meet supply and demand.

The Director and Deputy Director of the Bureau and all staff warmly welcomed them and served tea and snacks.</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony</p>
<p>At the entrance of the bureau at 126 Hankou Road, the Party and national flags were crossed left and right, and decorated with pine, cypress, and fresh flowers. All the staff wore red silk flowers, full of a new atmosphere. At 8:00 a.m., Chinese and foreign guests began to arrive one after another, and were warmly welcomed by the Director and Deputy Director of the Bureau and the staff, and led to visit various places. The auditorium was located in the conference hall on the third floor, with a portrait of Sun Yat-sen and Party and national flags hanging in the middle. The surrounding area was decorated with flower baskets, silver shields, and silver tripods presented by various sectors. At 9:00 a.m. sharp, the opening ceremony was held, the ceremony was simple and grand, and the Director, Deputy Director, and all managers and directors of the bureau, and all staff gathered in the auditorium. First, Zhang Jia'ao, Vice Governor of the Bank of China and Director of the Bureau, delivered a speech, followed by Chairman Kong Xiangxi. The ceremony ended at half past nine.</p>
<p>Director's Instructions</p>
<p>Director Zhang Jia'ao, who is also the Vice Governor, gave a speech, briefly saying that today is the official establishment of the Central Trust Bureau. After more than a year of preparation by Director Ye Zhuotang and others, and the thorough planning of Minister Kong, today's great cause was established. At this time of economic decline, Minister Kong resolutely organized the establishment of the Central Trust Bureau to promote savings and provide trust services to the country and society. His great spirit is truly admired by his colleagues. Today, Minister Kong came in person and will announce to his colleagues the motives for establishing the trust bureau and the great policies for the future.</p>
<p>Minister's Instructions</p>
<p>Chairman Kong Xiangxi, also Governor of the Central Bank, said in his instructions, briefly, that he was very happy to meet everyone today. The Central Trust Bureau has been in preparation for more than a year. Due to various reasons and the location of the bureau, it was delayed until today before it was officially established. Why did the central government want to establish the Central Trust Bureau? Because there are many events on the government side that need to be entrusted to a commercial institution for management. At the same time, the Central Bank is limited to the status of a national bank and acts as the national treasury, which is inconvenient in fact and in procedure. Therefore, a trust business independent agency was specially organized under the Central Bank to undertake all the affairs of the trust bureau, to handle various trusts and insurances, and to promote savings. The motive for promoting savings is not only commercial, but also has important political relations. The state has considerable guarantees for civil servants, such as future retirement, or in the event of an accident during the service period, and the payment of condolence money, so that they can be held responsible for their duties. The Ministry of Finance has regulations on this, such as bonuses and retirement money from the customs. The idea is to make every civil servant work hard for the public and must first settle his family, so that he has no worries. This matter was discussed with Chairman Chiang, who greatly agreed and advocated that the armed forces should also be promoted. Therefore, the bureau has the establishment of military savings, but savings are not limited to civil servants and armed forces, but also need to be expanded to the social sector. Therefore, other savings must be gradually handled in the future. However, the bureau was established by the government and should not compete with merchants for profit. As for the insurance business, the scope is not very large now, so I will not go into details. However, creating a business in the world is not only possible with organization, but also requires people to execute it, so every organization needs people to do it. The Central Trust Bureau is not only a commercial organization, but can be said to be very meaningful for the national construction plan. As the name suggests, if it cannot be done in practice, it will affect the Trust Bureau in the future. It has a great relationship and responsibility to the country and the nation. Because all people do things, first trust and then entrust. Not only must major entrustments be handled with caution, but also minor matters must be handled strictly. Today I advise my colleagues, no matter what, do not forget the word "trust", not only should you encourage yourself in official business, but also pay attention to your personal morality. And doing things is not in the size of the position, for example, building tall buildings, the materials of the beams and pillars are certainly necessary, but the connection depends on the strength of small nails, otherwise the doors and trees cannot be connected, and the building cannot be completed. Therefore, whether it is a senior or junior staff, everyone must work hard, do not think that the Trust Bureau is founded by the central government and has abundant capital, and waste everything casually and do things casually. You must know that the prosperity and decline of the country is every closely related to the diligence, frugality, extravagance, and laziness of the people. For example, our neighbor to the east, which can dominate the world, is due to the hard work of its people. If every one of us is hardworking and cautious, the country and the nation will have the hope of rejuvenation. The ancients said that everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the country. At this time of national crisis, I hope that my colleagues will pay attention. You must know that this bureau is a cause with great significance. In the future, you must be cautious in everything you encounter. Director Zhang's past spirit of doing things is admirable. I entrusted you with the responsibility of developing construction with mobile finance. I hope that you will all show your strengths, work hard, and develop the inherent spirit of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>Meeting of Directors and Supervisors</p>
<p>After the opening ceremony, a meeting of directors and supervisors was held at 9:45 a.m. Those present included Chairman Kong Xiangxi, Standing Directors Zhang Jia'ao and Guo Zhuotang, Directors Song Ziliang and Xu Kan, Supervisors Chen Xing, Li Ming, and Chen Guangfu. Chairman Kong Xiangxi presided over the meeting. During the meeting, the business policy and other matters were discussed in detail, and the meeting adjourned at 10:30 a.m.</p>
<p>Savings Announcement</p>
<p>Central Trust Bureau Announcement No. 2 says that the bureau was specially authorized by the National Government's order on August of the 24th year of the Republic to establish the Central Savings Association to handle savings matters such as monthly lotteries for bonus repayment and interest payment. The bureau has now allocated 5 million yuan of national currency as the fund of the association to handle the savings business with independent accounting, and a supervisory committee has been set up to review the use of funds. Except for the date of commencement of business, which will be determined and announced in detail, this announcement is made.</p>

Yesterday at 3 PM, the unveiling ceremony was held. Attendees included Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Aviation Association Chairman Wang Xiaolai, Secretary-General Yao Xijiu, Directors Li Dachao, Zeng Yijing, Nie Kaiyi, Solicitation Team Leaders Lin Genghou, Wu Qiding, and others.

Mayor Wu presided over the meeting, Chen Shuo gave a memorial address, and Huang Jun served as master of ceremonies. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Chairman Mayor Wu reported, briefly stating, "Distinguished guests, today is the unveiling ceremony for the Martyr Huang Yuquan Monument. Martyr Huang sacrificed himself at Hongqiao on January 28th. The China Aviation Association, to commemorate the martyr, built this monument here. Life and death are commonplace, but some deaths are heavier than Mount Tai, while others are lighter than a feather. Martyr Huang, in his prime, during the most precious time of his life, was able to sacrifice himself for the country and the nation. This death is extremely valuable. Though dead, he still lives on. Martyr Huang was an aviator and an air force officer. He aspired to be an aerial warrior. His sacrifice for the country and the nation during the January 28th Incident is truly regrettable. However, we, the survivors, to recognize merit and repay virtue, built this monument to commemorate and never forget. We deeply hope that all people of the nation and ambitious youth can emulate this spirit of patriotic fervor and strive for the survival of the country and the nation, so that the future will hold boundless hope."</p>
<p>Biographical Sketch</p>
<p>Following this, Aviation Association Chairman Wang Xiaolai reported on Martyr Huang's biographical sketch, saying, "Martyr Huang Yuquan was a native of Guangdong, born in the United States seven years before the founding of the Republic. His brother, Mr. Yupei, also grew up in the United States. After completing his studies, he served as a professor at the US Tites Aviation School. Martyr Huang, inspired by his brother, aspired to learn aviation and serve his motherland. Therefore, after graduating from middle school, he entered Tites Aviation School to study both flight and mechanical engineering. In the fifteenth year of the Republic, he returned to China and became a pilot. The following year, the martyr was dispatched to Russia to study military aviation, further deepening his knowledge. He then returned to China to serve, successively holding positions such as Chief of Flight Inspection, Senior Flight Mechanical Instructor, and Squadron Leader and Deputy Squadron Leader in the aviation team. He devoted himself to his duties and achieved outstanding results. Over several years, the nation faced numerous events. The martyr was ordered to rush to Guangdong, Guangxi, Shandong, Anhui, Shaanxi, and Henan, participating in almost every campaign. In the early spring of the twenty-first year, the martyr took leave from the north to return south and marry Miss He Qiaosheng in Guangzhou. Before a week had passed, the January 28th Incident occurred. His brother, Mr. Yupei, then serving as the captain of the Sixth Aviation Team, led his family to Shanghai. The martyr also came from Guangdong. On February 5th, he received orders to depart. At Hongqiao Airfield, he bravely took the lead. Suddenly, the aircraft was damaged, and the martyr died in service. Previously, due to mechanical failures, he had been forced to land, damaging the aircraft. However, the martyr, using his extraordinary skills, had always survived. Was it not heaven's will to fulfill his ambition to save the country through aviation and bestow upon him the honor of sacrificing himself for the nation? Saving the nation through aviation was Premier Sun Yat-sen's instruction. Martyr Huang Yuquan died implementing this instruction. Our China Aviation Association was also established to realize this instruction. Therefore, on January 15th of this year, during a board meeting, Director Zhang Hui proposed that a monument be erected to commemorate Martyr Huang Yuquan, who died in service at Hongqiao Airfield during the January 28th Incident. This was resolved and the association initiated the monument construction, entrusting Directors Zhang Hui, Yao Xijiu, and Hu Junzhuang to plan the project. Later, the Aviation Committee designated a location next to the Xiao De monument at Hongqiao Airfield for the martyr's monument. Association directors were responsible for fundraising, and the China Stone Company undertook the construction. Now, the monument is completed. The inscription on the monument was written by Chairman Lin of the National Government. The biographical sketch was written by Director Zhang Hui, and the inscription was drafted by myself. The calligraphy was done by Mayor Wu and Association Directors Wang Zhengting, Lin Kanghou, and Chen Qingyun – all dedicated to saving the country through aviation. Today, we hold this unveiling ceremony. Your presence and participation signify your shared sentiment. The martyr's illustrious name will forever endure with this monument."</p>
<p>Family Response</p>
<p>The martyr's brother, Huang Yupei, currently serving as the principal of the Luoyang branch of the Central Aviation School, also attended to represent the family and give a brief response, saying, "My younger brother, Yuquan, died for the country, fulfilling a duty that the people are willing to undertake. The China Aviation Association erected this monument, and today, we hold this unveiling ceremony. I am grateful for the presence of representatives from all sectors. I feel deeply saddened but also express my gratitude. During the January 28th Incident, my younger brother served as the deputy captain of the Sixth Aviation Team. Angered by the national crisis, he bravely took the lead. Despite being outnumbered, he engaged in combat and suffered severe injuries, sacrificing himself in service on February 5th. My younger brother's death for the country is not to be regretted. I hope that my fellow countrymen will pay attention to the construction of the air force so that we can achieve the goal of resisting foreign aggression and ensuring our survival in the future," etc. The meeting adjourned at 5 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Shanghai Municipal Audit Office - Status of Expanding Operations <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Since its establishment in April of this year, the Shanghai Municipal Audit Office, through the efforts of Director Lin Jinyu, has gradually been brought onto the right track. The audit procedures for all agencies affiliated with the Shanghai Municipal Government have been properly coordinated. Pre-audits have already begun, and post-audits are also underway. Supervisory affairs are also increasing daily. On-site audits, for example, not only provide various conveniences to administrative agencies, but also allow for rapid and in-depth audit effectiveness. Additionally, agencies can thereby obtain proper guidance in accounting. Mr. Lin holds a Ph.D. in Economics from New York University and is deeply knowledgeable in economics, accounting, finance, statistics, and other fields. He has also served as a department head in the Ministry of Audit for many years, possessing both extensive academic knowledge and experience. Therefore, his management of affairs is meticulously planned, and he is energetic and capable in overseeing operations. All staff members are able to work diligently for the public good, and their work efficiency and performance are outstanding. The Ministry of Audit places great trust in him. When other provinces and cities establish audit branches and encounter difficulties in design and implementation, the Ministry often dispatches Mr. Lin to provide guidance. Therefore, Mr. Lin's affairs are also becoming increasingly busy.</p>

<p>The due date for long-term credit loans to Shanghai industrial and commercial businesses from the money shops, at 10% interest, is rapidly approaching. At a time when all industries are in decline, the Shanghai Money Shops Association, through a decision by its Executive Committee, has notified its member shops to provide accommodations within possible limits for long-term credit loans expiring at the end of October. As for long-term credit loans made directly and indirectly by Ningbo money shops in Shanghai, totaling approximately 15 million yuan, which were originally intended to be collected, the Ningbo shops have now agreed to accommodate the request of the industrial and commercial borrowers and extend the loans. However, according to the New Voice News Agency, the industrial and commercial borrowers have now separately negotiated extension matters with the Shanghai and Ningbo shops. Therefore, the difficulty at the end of October can generally be overcome smoothly.</p>

<p>Taxpayers' Association Sent Letter to the Public Works Department Yesterday</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Shanghai International Settlement sent a letter to the Public Works Department yesterday, stating: "To the Director, we are writing on behalf of Lihua Association, Shen Zhuang, Taiping Bank, Meiwen Silk Weaving Factory, Gengyuan Company, Huichang Zhuang, Dalai Zhuang, Juntaizhuang, Xiexing Zhuang, Guangcheng Zhuang, Hengjiuzhuang, Jiufeng, Dunchang, Zhentai, Hongzhang, Dailai Factory, Dachang Silk Factory, etc., who have jointly signed and sealed a letter stating: 'Our firms have been renting premises in Lane 170 (Fusuili) of Tianjin Road and along the road for many years. Due to the current economic downturn and poor business, we have repeatedly discussed and requested rent reductions to compensate for our losses. Landlord Yao Muji has generously agreed to reduce the rent by approximately 15% across the board, starting from August of this year, and this has been implemented. The Public Works Department collects police rates based on the actual rental amount. Since the landlord has considered the difficulties faced by businesses and generously agreed to reduce the rent by approximately 15%, all Public Works Department police rates should also be collected based on the current actual rent, in order to comply with the statutory rate and reduce the burden on businesses. Accordingly, we have prepared a list of the rental amounts currently paid by our firms and request that you review and forward it to the Public Works Department for verification and reduction of the rate, which will be greatly appreciated.' A copy of the list has been sent to the Association. We hereby send this letter to request your verification and action. Sincerely, To Mr. Fei, Acting Director of the Shanghai International Settlement Public Works Department."</p>
<h3 id="e109">Opium Addicts' Voluntary Registration - Approved Extension of One Month <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Compulsory Registration to be Implemented from November 1st</p>
<p>The Shanghai Public Safety Bureau was ordered to handle the voluntary registration period for opium addicts, which was originally scheduled to end on September 30th. However, due to the short period, some opium addicts were unable to register on time. The bureau has now obtained approval from the municipal government to allow opium addicts to continue to register voluntarily during the first month (i.e., October) of the compulsory registration period, without being fined, to show leniency. From November 1st, the decision was made to implement compulsory registration and impose penalties according to regulations. The bureau issued a public notice to the citizens on September 30th, which stated: "It has been over two months since this bureau began implementing the registration of opium addicts. We have repeatedly instructed our subordinates to conduct door-to-door persuasion. The number of opium addicts who have voluntarily come to register has been quite enthusiastic. The deadline for voluntary registration has now passed. From October to the end of December, it will be the compulsory registration period. During this period, if any opium addicts are found to be concealing themselves, once discovered by this bureau, they should be punished according to Article 4 of the 'Measures for Registering Opium Addicts During the Compulsory Period,' which provides for a fine of fifty yuan up to three hundred yuan. They will then be forced to register. However, considering that the registration period for opium addicts in this city is short, some opium addicts are unclear about the registration procedures and are hesitant to register, so the number of those who have not come to the bureau for voluntary registration on time is not small. If we do not leniently give them an opportunity to confess, and punish them all, it would be contrary to the government's intention to protect the citizens. This bureau has submitted a request to the municipal government, which has been approved under Instruction No. 3177, to allow opium addicts to register voluntarily during the first month (i.e., October) of the compulsory registration period. If, after repeated persuasion, there are still those who stubbornly resist and disobey, they will be detained and forced to register, but they will not be fined, to show leniency. From November 1st, this bureau will strictly investigate and implement compulsory registration, and impose penalties according to regulations, in order to complete the registration of opium addicts by the end of this year. This extension of the voluntary registration period is the final deadline. Opium addicts will no longer have the opportunity to confess. They should all be aware of the severity of the law and the urgency of the situation, and encourage each other to come to the bureau to register. If there are still those who are hesitant and delay, and are unwilling to come forward voluntarily, after the end of October, they will be detained and severely punished according to the law, without any leniency. Let all comply without fail. This is a public notice."</p>

As for the No. 52 giant aircraft borrowed from Germany, it was originally scheduled to take off for China around the end of last month. However, due to assembly delays, it has been delayed. Yesterday, it was rumored that the aircraft had already taken off for China. A reporter from the Huadong News Agency went to the company to inquire, but both Secretary Zhu and Secretary Cha were out on official business. The other staff members said that they had not heard any confirmation of the flight to China.

The letters from Tonghui Primary School and Minfeng Tobacco Company colleagues are also published below: (1) "To the Director, since the beginning of this summer, the river floods have been severe, with widespread desolation, and villages and cities have become ruins. As the autumn winds grow colder, we think of our fellow countrymen in the disaster areas, without clothing or food, and their suffering. Although the teachers and students of our school usually only get enough to eat and keep warm, and have no savings, they are much better off than the displaced victims. Therefore, they have each saved from their daily expenses and fruit costs, totaling 101 yuan and 2 jiao and 8 fen, which we respectfully entrust to your newspaper to forward to the Shanghai Flood Relief Association for distribution. We know that this is only a drop in the bucket and will not be of much help, but it is enough to fulfill our duty and put our conscience at ease. If you can publish this letter in your newspaper to encourage donations, we would be very grateful. Sincerely, Shanghai Shaoxing Shuimu Industrial Private Tonghui Primary School. (2) "To the Director, since the beginning of this summer, floods have ravaged the provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Shandong, Anhui, etc., leaving refugees everywhere. Now that it is deep autumn, without clothing or food, there is a risk of freezing and starvation. Although we have compassion, we are ashamed of our lack of ability to help. We have completely saved the Double Tenth Feast expenses of our colleagues, totaling 20 yuan, which will be remitted through the Bank of China. Please receive and forward it to the Disaster Relief Association to express the small intention of our colleagues to love our fellow countrymen, and please send the receipt. Sincerely, Colleagues of Guangdong Minfeng Tobacco Company." (The following is omitted.)</p>

<p>The Chinese Jiesheng Association, considering the Min Sheng Canal in Qi County, Henan, to be the county's largest water conservancy project, allocated 10,000 yuan from its charity funds in the autumn of the 18th year of the Republic to repair the canal, which could irrigate over 1,000 hectares. In recent years, various places have suffered from major droughts and floods, but the county has achieved bumper harvests. This was previously reported in the newspaper. Now, the association has received a letter from Liu Junye, Chairman of the Min Sheng Canal Management Committee in Qi County, reporting that, according to the investigators, the 1,000 hectares of land irrigated by the canal this year have yielded over 20,000 more shi of grain in the spring and autumn seasons compared to previous years, worth over 200,000 yuan. The canal is now releasing water again, and wheat seedlings are being widely planted, with the hope of a bumper harvest next year. The reason reported is that the culverts and sluices of the canal have been completely repaired, are sturdy and flexible, close when the water is low, and open when the water is high, so that droughts and floods are no longer a concern. The authorities advocate agricultural revitalization and benefit the people, and their merits are truly inconceivable.</p>

<p>And Guides on How to Affix New Stamps</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce received the Ministry of Finance's regulations on the exchange of old stamp tax stamps for new stamp tax stamps, it has established an exchange office to collect registered old stamps and guide on how to affix new stamp tax stamps. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Urging Payment of Old Stamps</p>
<p>The association yesterday notified all households that have registered but have not yet submitted their old stamps, stating: "To the Director, after the Ministry of Finance announced the regulations on the exchange of old stamp tax stamps for new stamps on July 28th, this association published a notice that all households that registered their old stamps with this association last year should quickly submit the registered old stamps that were returned to them, so that they can be sent to the Jiangsu Stamp, Tobacco, and Alcohol Tax Bureau to exchange them for new stamps one by one. Up to now, the matter of new stamps cannot be processed. We hereby urgently send this letter to notify you to submit the registered old stamps to this association within days, and do not delay."</p>
<p>Guidance on Affixing</p>
<p>After the association provided detailed guidance on how to affix new stamp tax stamps, merchants in the city became relatively clear. Now that the Ministry of Finance's Stamp Tax Inspection Committee is about to begin its work, the association has printed an additional 2,000 copies of the special compilation of the new stamp tax law to avoid merchants missing or incorrectly affixing stamps and being penalized, and will gradually submit them to the Ministry for instructions and send any explanatory letters that are received to the Commercial Monthly in September. The magazine will be published in a day or two and can be used as a reference. The "Brief Explanation of the New Stamp Tax Law" compiled by the association's secretary, Yan Esheng, is the clearest and most accessible instruction and will continue to be published daily.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Passengers who Declare Traveling Without a Ticket, etc., are Exempt from Fines <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau received Training Order No. 337 from the Ministry of Railways, stating: "According to the Business Department's submission of a letter from the Traffic Department of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, regarding the issuance of Training Order No. 2610 from the ministry, instructing to revise the regulations on supplementary tickets and fines, and to amend Article 47, paragraph 1, of the Passenger Transport Regulations, etc." After approval, they were instructed to comply. "However, Article 47 of the regulations stipulates that passengers who travel beyond their station or class, if they declare in advance, may be exempt from fines. Does this measure still apply? Also, for passengers traveling without a ticket, in addition to paying the fare, are the fines not waived regardless of the reason? As the interpretation of the regulations is concerned, this department does not dare to act on its own," etc. After review, the ministry's amendment of Article 47 of the Passenger Transport Regulations refers to paragraph 1. The provisos in Items 2 and 3 of paragraph 1 have not been amended. Therefore, the measure of exempting passengers who declare in advance from punishment for traveling beyond their station or class still applies. As for whether fines for passengers traveling without a ticket should not be waived regardless of the reason, since the original article had no proviso, fines should not be waived in any case. However, it has been found that some passengers traveling without a ticket do not have enough time to buy a ticket before the train departs. It does not seem fair not to provide for a waiver in such cases. Therefore, the provisos in Items 2 and 3 of paragraph 1 of the above article are deleted, and the proviso is amended so that all three situations can be applied. The amended wording is as follows: (1) Traveling without a ticket, (2) traveling beyond the station, (3) traveling beyond the class. However, passengers in the above three situations who declare to the conductor or ticket inspector when boarding the train or before traveling beyond the station or class may be exempt from paying additional fines. In addition to separate orders, you are instructed to comply. This is an order.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Fish Market Workers to Adopt Employment System <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Hoping to Avoid the Abuses of the Contracting System</p>
<p>The Shanghai Fish Market building project of the Ministry of Industries is nearing completion, and various preparations are actively underway. This has been reported in previous issues. The handling of fish differs from ordinary goods, and the method of worker management that would be both efficient and free of corruption is also a question. Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency met with a member of the Preparatory Committee of the market and inquired whether a decision had been made. The committee member stated responsibly that the issue of dockworker management had been discussed multiple times in the Standing Committee meeting. Considering the many abuses inherent in the contracting system, it was decided not to adopt it. Instead, workers will be hired directly by the market to avoid exploitation by contractors, allowing laborers to receive their full earnings. Furthermore, considering that some dockworkers from fish businesses may face unemployment, priority will be given to hiring them to ensure a skilled workforce. The specific methods of hiring and management are currently being planned in consultation between the Ministry and the Central People’s Movement Guidance Committee. Recently, there have been reports of unscrupulous individuals falsely claiming affiliation to deceive and swindle others. The Committee is determined to investigate such matters, and assistance from all sectors is requested to report any such incidents to the Committee. Finally, it is reiterated that the fish market was established with the approval of the Central Political Conference, following a proposal by the Ministry of Industries. The Ministry allocated 500,000 yuan in official start-up funds as a national investment. Additional funding was also provided as a loan from the Ministry of Industries. Recent reports in some newspapers stating that the funds were temporarily advanced by the National Economic Council are not accurate.</p>

Vouchers are available for purchase in bulk. If customers pay more than the set price, the service personnel will provide change using vouchers according to the amount paid.</p>

<p>Visitors From All Sectors Show Great Enthusiasm. South African Exotic Fish to be Displayed Soon.</p>
<p>The giant whale specimen at the Municipal Zoo has been completed and was displayed starting yesterday morning for public viewing. Several species of small exotic fish from South Africa will be displayed after the specimen room is prepared. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Giant Whale Display</p>
<p>To enhance public knowledge, the Municipal Zoo collected a giant whale previously discovered on the Chongming beach. After being transported back to Shanghai, the process of creating a specimen began. The whale specimen is over three zhang (approximately 10 meters) long, seven to eight chi (approximately 2.3-2.7 meters) high, and has a circumference of over one zhang. Six civilian houses were acquired to display the giant whale, and after construction was completed, the specimen was opened to the public yesterday morning. An entrance fee is charged, but no other fees are collected.</p>
<p>South African Exotic Fish</p>
<p>The zoo recently collected several species of small exotic fish from South Africa, placing them in glass tanks. These include four zebra fish, one “door fish” (said to engage in fierce battles when placed with other male fighting fish), one glass fish (whose entire skeleton, brain, and stomach are transparent), and five or six “trailer beard” fish. These will be displayed to the public after the specimen room is prepared.</p>
<p>Elephant Enclosure Construction</p>
<p>The zoo previously purchased an elephant from India. Since its arrival in Shanghai, the elephant has been temporarily housed in a bamboo enclosure because the elephant enclosure had not been built. This arrangement has proven inconvenient for visitors. The zoo has obtained approval from the Municipal Education Bureau to allocate funds for the construction of an elephant enclosure at a suitable location. Construction has begun, using iron bars all around and a cement roof, making it extremely sturdy. It is expected to be completed by the middle of the month.</p>

The vessel's captain was previously dispatched by the Schichau iron factory during the testing period, so that he would be familiar with the vessel's machinery. It has now been heard that the captain's contract is about to expire, and the Dredging Bureau has decided to hire a Chinese captain to captain the giant (Construction) vessel. Yesterday, a notice was issued stating that candidates must have the following qualifications: (1) a fully qualified Class A captain's certificate; (2) a thorough understanding of the general conditions of the Yangtze River estuary; (3) the ability to operate the vessel during dredging operations, and possess exceptional piloting skills and experience; and (4) be no more than 45 years of age. The salary during the probationary period is set at 50 British pounds, plus 60 yuan for housing. Applicants with the above skills should submit their applications to the Bureau before October 24th, pending a scheduled examination.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Workers at the Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant Oppose Service Rules <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Company Says They Will Await Authorities' Review</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the workers at the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company have petitioned the Party and government authorities and made requests to the company due to their opposition to the worker service rules. This was reported in yesterday’s newspaper. A reporter visited the company yesterday and, according to the company, the workers’ representatives spoke with the deputy manager of the company the other day but did not put forward concrete opinions. As for the worker service rules, they were formulated according to the workers’ past service at the company, based on labor laws and local worker service rules, and were approved by the social affairs bureau and implemented on July 1st. It has been three months since then. The articles that the workers reportedly oppose, such as articles 23, 24, 49, and 52, etc., have no legitimate reason for opposition. A review of the articles will immediately reveal this. The provision in Article 14 is due to the fact that water and electricity are essential for residents’ daily use and local security, and cannot be interrupted day or night. If there is an obstacle, it should be repaired immediately and cannot be stopped outside of working hours. Also, when work is urgent and the original workers are insufficient or inadequate to handle it, it is unavoidable to have workers from other departments take on the responsibility temporarily. The company treats its staff in the same way, and it has been the practice for many years to give extra wages for temporary work outside of working hours. The workers have never expressed dissent, and it is unexpected that they are suddenly opposed. The company can only await the review of the relevant authorities. The articles of the service rules that the workers reportedly oppose are listed below: Article 14: Even though the company’s workers have stipulated working hours, the supervisor may summon them to work or order them to extend their working hours when necessary, and the workers may not refuse on the grounds of excuse. If a worker is instructed by a supervisor to take on other types of work temporarily during working hours, the worker may not refuse on the grounds of excuse. Article 23: Workers may not leave their posts without permission during working hours, or engage in activities that hinder the work of others, or read books, newspapers, or magazines, or talk, laugh, or play with others. Article 24: Workers may not linger in any of the company’s workplaces outside of working hours. Article 49: After a worker’s leave of absence expires, he or she should immediately return to the company to cancel the leave. If it is necessary to extend the leave, it is limited to one time, except in cases of illness, and may not exceed half of the original leave. Article 52: Workers may not request leave of absence during work hours, but this does not apply if there is an important incident that is proven to be true and has been approved by the supervisor.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Special District Rickshaw Guild Petitioned the Vehicle Committee Yesterday Morning <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Requesting Re-Registration Due to Insufficient Rickshaw Pullers</p>
<p>The Special District Rickshaw Guild petitioned the Vehicle Committee yesterday morning regarding the registration of rickshaw pullers. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Rickshaw Business Petition</p>
<p>The Special District Rickshaw Guild believed that the number of registered rickshaw pullers was too small, and in addition, pullers were continuously returning to their hometowns, leading to an insufficient supply. They held a meeting the night before and resolved to (1) send representatives Hou Shaoan, Lu Dexin, and others to petition the Vehicle Committee to re-register as much as possible; (2) send experts to conduct research on new rickshaw designs; (3) notify each rickshaw owner to separately compile and report the number of registered rickshaw pullers, the number of people who have returned to their hometowns or changed jobs, and submit them to the guild for discussion; (4) manage the vehicles, keep them clean and hygienic, and stay until midnight. Yesterday morning at 5:00 AM, petition representatives Hou Shaoan and Lu Dexin went to the Vehicle Committee to petition, where they were received by Wang Zhiren. Regarding the point of maximizing registration, he promised to submit it to the chairman for approval.</p>
<p>Notice to Rickshaw Owners</p>
<p>The guild issued a notice to all rickshaw owners stating that since the Public Works Bureau inspected rickshaw puller armbands on September 15th of this year, they have received a flood of letters from rickshaw owners, claiming that there were not enough rickshaw pullers, resulting in many vehicles being idled and business plummeting. If the rickshaw puller registration is not supplemented, it will inevitably lead to bankruptcy. Based on this, the office convened the 90th emergency meeting of the board of directors the other day, and decided to send representatives, including Mr. Hou Shaoan, to negotiate with the authorities. The authorities have now agreed to the request. However, each rickshaw owner must, within three days from the date of this announcement, compile the number of rickshaws owned, the number of registered rickshaw pullers, the number of people who have returned to their hometowns or changed jobs and have taken their armbands with them, and each item such as the names of the rickshaw pullers and the numbers of their armbands, and report them to the guild. This is so that a method can be negotiated to maximize the registration of rickshaw pullers, and to avoid the difficulties of "having vehicles but no pullers, and having pullers but no vehicles." This matter is closely related to the vital interests of rickshaw owners, the survival of their business, and the lives of rickshaw pullers, and is extremely important. It is hoped that each rickshaw owner will proceed quickly and conscientiously in accordance with the above-mentioned time frame and methods, and do not delay or delay, so as not to cause self-defeating. In addition to publishing notices in the Xin and Shen newspapers, special letters are sent separately as above.</p>

<p>The Luxing District Municipal Committee members, Mr. Zhang Qiwen and others, in view of the prevalence of disease in the past and the high death rate, specially discussed with local people last year and agreed to establish a temporary plague hospital in Xishejiaqiao. It opened for three months and treated more than 3,800 people. This year, a temporary plague hospital was set up again near the Xinlu Railway Station. Many people came to the hospital for treatment. Countless intractable diseases were considered unsolvable by the villagers, but were treated by the hospital. In addition, Dr. Qu Shaoheng, the director of medical affairs of the hospital, paid special attention to obstetrics in the countryside, and specially assigned experienced people under his care to the hospital to be in charge of midwifery. There were also many cases of difficult births that were successfully resolved by their surgery, ensuring the safety of both mother and child. It is now heard that the original three-month term is about to expire and should be closed immediately. When the villagers heard the news, they were deeply worried that if they get sick in the future, it will be difficult to find a place to receive treatment.</p>

<p>Relates Jones' Ordeal in Detail; Lucky to Not be Harmed When Bandit Gun Misfired</p>
<p>The "China Press" reports that German Dr. Mueller, who was kidnapped by bandits in Chahar with British journalist Mr. Jones and subsequently released, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing on Sunday night. From 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM on Monday evening, he was hosted by Dr. Grimmpuff at his residence at No. 75 Guangzhou Road. Several journalists were present. During the gathering, Dr. Mueller recounted in detail the ordeal of Mr. Jones' death. It was generally believed that Dr. Mueller's escape was likely due to his fluency in Chinese. The doctor answered questions cheerfully, as if the recent events had not disturbed his inner peace. The doctor is scheduled to fly to Beiping (Beijing) on China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) at 6:30 AM on Tuesday from Longhua Airport. The doctor is known for his bravery among his peers. When the bandits opened fire on the two of them, the doctor still faced them head-on, much to the surprise of the bandits. The doctor believed that the bandits originally intended to kill them on the spot. They fired over forty bullets, three of which grazed the doctor's body. Fortunately, the bandit's machine gun suddenly misfired, thus avoiding immediate death on the spot. The doctor also confirmed that the route they traveled was designated by the Japanese. The doctor had recently toured the Shandong flood-stricken area for two weeks, and then stayed in Xindu for a week before arriving in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Mr. Walshiff Appointed Because He Has No Ties To Either Side</p>
<p>The Shanghai "The China Press" reported that Chief Judge Helmick of the U.S. Court for China issued an order on Monday afternoon appointing Mr. Walshiff, the general manager of Chinese General Sales Corporation, as the custodian of the company. The company had invoked U.S. bankruptcy law and petitioned the U.S. Court to appoint a custodian last week. The petition stated that the company's total assets exceeded its total liabilities, but it was unable to meet its maturing debts due to financial deficits and falling real estate prices. The company's real estate is worth more than 17 million yuan, but it has only 60,000 yuan in cash. It therefore requested the court to appoint a custodian to take over the assets and continue operations pending the formulation of a reorganization plan in accordance with U.S. bankruptcy law and approval by the court. Mr. Hickmick appointed Mr. Walshiff as the custodian of the company because he had recently arrived in Shanghai from the United States, had no ties to any party, and was fair-minded. He would continue to operate the company pending further orders, but he must submit a surety bond of US$50,000 as proof of faithful performance of his duties. The surety bond is reportedly to be filed today (Tuesday).</p>
<p>The "Ta Mei Wan Pao" reported that Mr. Walshiff's US$50,000 surety bond was filed today (the 1st). Mr. Walshiff stated today that the company will continue to operate as usual pending further orders from the U.S. Court.</p>

<p>The "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that Russian Mr. Krilloff, and three other Russian youths, Mr. Sokoloff, 27 years old, Mr. Hrutniff, 22 years old, and Mr. Zayriff, 24 years old, departed from Shanghai on a 24-foot, four-ton sailboat on Monday night, planning a grand tour around the world. Their intended plan is to take the route of Hong Kong, Borneo, Sumatra, and Java to reach Australia. After arriving there, they will decide whether to head east to South America or west to South Africa. However, before departure, it had been decided that this trip would not pass through the Suez Canal, as they advocate as long a voyage as possible. The trip is for leisure purposes. Each place will stay for two weeks. The ship stores enough food for three months. If there is a shortage, it will be purchased along the way. The journey will rely only on the power of sails. No auxiliary engine is installed in the boat. As for how long it will take or how long it will take to complete the entire journey, it cannot be determined in advance. It will take about at least a year.</p>

<p>Shanghai Residents Visiting Minhang Should Take Extra Precautions</p>
<p>The Health Department of the Municipal Council has previously issued a warning to the public through newspapers that dangerous malaria is prevalent in the Minhang area south of Shanghai. Travelers to Minhang should take extra precautions. They should stay behind screens or mosquito nets after dark to prevent mosquito bites or consult a doctor beforehand and take quinine or other mixtures for prevention. Now, according to a report from the Director of the Health Department, many villagers have recently been sent to the Municipal Council Inspection Office from the Minhang area by their relatives. They are all suffering from malignant tertian malaria. There are also foreign residents in the area who are infected. The Health Department is currently intensifying its investigation, and the report is not yet complete. The Director of the Health Department also stated that there is no malignant tertian malaria in Shanghai proper. This type of malaria is extremely difficult to treat, and patients often have difficulty recovering after the illness. Minhang is very close, and many people travel there, so in order to avoid infection and protect the safety of the city, it is hoped that those Shanghai residents who go to Minhang should follow the previous warning and take extra precautions to avoid causing trouble for themselves.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Assassination Case from Seven Years Ago; Two Masterminds Arrested <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Public Security Bureau Requests Transfer; Court Orders Postponement for Further Hearing</p>
<p>Gu Da Gouzi, foreman of the British-owned Gongyi Yarn Factory at 150 Robison Road in Shanghai West, was shot and killed on Robison Road in August of the 17th year of the Republic of China. The case has been going on for seven years, and the murderer has not been caught. The night before last, Sha Daxin, captain of the Fourth Squad of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, learned that a suspect in the case, Yuan Aliang, was hiding at No. 14 Renrui Lane, Caojiadu. He then, together with the Sixth District Public Security Bureau, arrested Yuan. Yuan confessed that the masterminds were Zhao Chunquan and Zhao Bingquan, two local brothers who were the chief foremen of the Gongyi Yarn Factory. Their home is at No. 77 Ziyang Lane, 190 Wuding Road. Captain Sha then reported to the relevant Gordon Road Police Station at around 2:00 AM yesterday, and together with Chinese Detective Zhu Mengwei, arrested the two Zhaos and took them to the police station. At 5:30 AM, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The Zhao brothers hired lawyer Chen Ru to represent them in court. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the case, saying that this case was an assistance case. When arresting Zhao Chunquan and Zhao Bingquan, the police found two pistols and two licenses. The two guns have now been sent to the Municipal Council Armory for inspection. Therefore, the case requests a postponement. The arrested Yuan Aliang confessed that he was 49 years old and had been a foreman in the Yisha Factory. He knew Zhao Chunquan and others. The deceased, Gu Da Gouzi, was also a foreman in the factory. On a certain day before his death, the Zhao brothers and Wang Xiaoxiazi, Ouyang, Yao Lu and others, who are still at large, discussed in a small room upstairs in the Gongyi Yarn Factory that Gu Xiaogouzi's work in the factory was quite unfavorable to them, so they planned to ask someone to take drastic action. At that time, I passed by the factory and happened to hear this. Later, I was dragged in by them, and so on. Moreover, Shua Dasheng and Shan Bin, the officers from the Public Security Bureau, applied to transfer the case. Zhao Chunquan confessed, saying that the deceased Gu Da Gouzi, Yuan Aliang and others were all foremen who were subordinate to me, and there was no enmity. What Yuan confessed was completely untrue.

<p>Yu Tianxiang, a member of the Fourth Squad of the Defense Corps in the Zhao Family Garden area near Zhongshan Road in Zhabei, a Henan native, about thirty years old, was assigned to serve at the Zhengfeng School on Jiaotong Road. At about 8:00 PM the night before last, Yu Tianxiang was walking along Zhangjiazhai on the west side of Jiaotong Road when he was suddenly shot by thugs. The bullet entered from his back and exited from his chest. Yu fell to the ground injured, and the thugs fled in all directions. Because the area was extremely desolate and there were few pedestrians, no one noticed the incident at the time. Later, the patrol officer of the Tanziwan Police Station in charge of the area happened to see Yu Tianxiang lying in a pool of blood. Because the injury was to a vital area, he had already died. He returned to the police station to report and immediately sent people to search for the murderers in all directions. However, it was too late, and the bandits had already escaped without a trace. Yesterday afternoon, Yao Liansheng, the local guarantor of the Twenty-Third Tu in Pengpu District, was ordered to report to the local court and request an autopsy. After receiving the report, the court summoned Prosecutor Xie Lian to interrogate him once and ordered him to wait at the scene of the body for the arrival of the coroner. According to the report, the incident occurred about half a li from the Zhengfeng School. The deceased was diligent in his service and was always valued by his superiors. This tragic incident is believed to be a vendetta. It is said that there were also many knife wounds on his head. The police station in charge has already started investigating and arresting the murderers to bring them to justice.</p>

<p>At around 3:00 AM yesterday morning, Yu Guoying, a native of Zhuji, Zhejiang, who lived at No. 54 Fu'anfang, Yongxing Road (west of Huiwen Road), Zhabei, and worked as a foreman in a military uniform factory, was returning home from the Concession via North Zhejiang Road after having done business in the Concession. Unexpectedly, when he went up the bridge, several thugs, each holding axes and sharp knives, ambushed him and followed him onto the bridge. Without asking any questions, they slashed and stabbed Yu indiscriminately. Yu fell to the ground injured and lay on the bridge. Fortunately, someone reported to the patrol police officer in charge, who telephoned the Firefighting Association and dispatched an ambulance to send him to Renji Hospital in the Concession's Makai Circle for treatment. According to the doctor's examination, he suffered serious injuries to the head and neck, and his life may be in danger.</p>

<p>How Can a Son Feel at Ease?</p>
<p>The French Concession Police Department discovered some sort of organization in the house at No. 3, Lane 268, Fulu Li Road in the French Concession some days ago. It sent Chinese and foreign detectives to search the premises. Zhu Xianzou, a native of Anhui who lived in the pavilion, was suspected and arrested for interrogation. Because no connection was found, he was released. However, Zhu never returned home. His old mother, surnamed Mou, about fifty years old, suddenly had a momentary thought. On the evening of the 30th of last month, she hanged herself with a hemp rope on the stairs when people were quiet at dusk. Yesterday morning at six o'clock, the rope she hanged herself with suddenly broke for some unknown reason, and the old woman's body rolled down the stairs with a loud noise. At this time, a detective assigned by the French Police Department to conduct a secret investigation happened to arrive at the door. Hearing the noise, he entered and saw that the old woman's body had rolled down to the bottom of the stairs. He felt that the body was already cold and reported to Zhang Daosheng, the local landlord who lived in the bungalow behind the house. Zhang Daosheng reported to the French Police Department, which sent detectives to carry the body to the Sijen Auxiliary Yuantang Corpse Inspection Office. Since there was no way to find her family, the Second Special Court was notified. Prosecutor Wang Ren and the forensic scribe arrived at the office and confirmed that Zhu Mou had indeed committed suicide by hanging. The body was handed over to the Tongren Auxiliary Yuantang for embalming and burial pending identification by her family.</p>

<h3 id="e146">Tobacco Leaf Association Writes to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Requesting Leadership to Protect National Livelihood <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The Tobacco Leaf Industry Association sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating: "We respectfully inform you that members of our association and cigarette manufacturers often go to Henan Province to purchase tobacco leaves, and Xuchang is the place where tobacco leaves are concentrated. The British American Tobacco Company in this city, in the past, under the name of its liaison Ren Boyan, established a tobacco leaf factory there to purchase tobacco leaves at low prices, process them, and sell them. The quantity was very large. As a foreign company infringing on domestic rights and interests, violating agreements, and manipulating and oppressing, it has long been criticized by the Chinese people. Fortunately, the provincial authorities discovered this and immediately ordered the factory to stop operating, which was applauded by the people. Later, all sectors of Xuchang, fearing that foreign economic aggression might reignite, jointly requested the government to abolish the tobacco factory base and return it to the local government for the construction of schools or hospitals to prevent future troubles. However, the matter was about to be completed when Shi Kunshan, a staff member at the time, sold it to the Xuchang Company on behalf of the company. Upon investigation, although the Xuchang Company is ostensibly organized by the Chinese Wu Tingsheng, it is still affiliated with the British American Tobacco Company behind the scenes, merely using this to avoid the attention of our government and people. Now, we have learned that their plan is to transfer the tobacco factory base to the Yu-Su Curing Tobacco Factory after it is purchased by the Xuchang Company. On the one hand, they will mortgage the property to the British American Tobacco Company. In one transfer, the economic power will still be taken over by foreigners. Now, Niu Siming, an American who has been working for the British American Tobacco Company for more than ten years, has been introduced by Wu Tingsheng to serve as the technical advisor and general manager of the Yu-Su Curing Tobacco Factory. He has also used this position to appoint six foreigners from the company to various key positions. Preparations have been fully completed and all of this has been created by Wu Tingsheng. Anyone with blood in their veins despises such people who willingly pander to foreigners and act as accomplices, disregarding the suffering of the people. The factory is currently actively proceeding. Once realized, the tobacco leaves produced in the province will surely be completely taken over by them. Not only will the tobacco farmers be oppressed, and their suffering will be endless, but also more than 300,000 people in the producing areas and the ports of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Hankou who depend on this industry for their livelihoods will become unemployed. Chinese cigarette factories will also be hit. The damage is extremely serious. The matter concerns collusion with foreigners to invade domestic rights and interests and harm people's livelihoods. All Chinese people should unanimously condemn it. The members of our association feel deeply and cannot remain silent. Therefore, we are writing this letter to earnestly request that your association, considering that the matter concerns the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people, quickly take the lead in thoroughly explaining the pros and cons, and conveying them to the authorities. We earnestly request that you strictly order your subordinates to make every effort to stop it, so as to avoid causing harm to the local area and protect the livelihoods of the people. We are extremely grateful." It is reported that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has reported the situation to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and is requesting that they issue orders to stop it in order to protect the livelihoods of the Chinese people.</p>

<p>The Chinese team of the Shanghai International Merchant Corps is well-trained in shooting and is the most prestigious team in the country. It has always achieved excellent results, with a full spirit. After Chen Shixia became the captain, they became more serious. They have repeatedly won championships in various team competitions and have won the entire team shield three times in three years. The details have been recorded in previous newspapers. It is now learned that the team received Team Order No. 41 yesterday, announcing that the Chinese team had won the Japanese Silver Cup, which is the most difficult to win. The news is exciting. It is heard that the cup is a prize presented by Japanese merchants in Shanghai to the best team in the Merchant Corps throughout the year. The results and discipline are included in the competition rules. The winner is not only the champion of the entire team, but also gains the honor of wearing a special badge on their military cap. According to the records, the Chinese team won once in the second year of the competition and again in the previous competition. Therefore, this consecutive victory is the third time. From this point of view, the Chinese team's dominance in the Merchant Corps and its rare success is unprecedented in the entire team. It is recorded here to comfort the Chinese people. In addition, the Chinese team's recruitment of the 30th reserve team members has not yet closed. In recent days, many businessmen in Shanghai have been enthusiastically going to the team at No. 131 Hankou Road to inquire about and register.</p>

<p>After the memorial service for Zeng Mengpu in Changshu was initiated by people from political, business, cultural, and artistic circles in Beijing and Shanghai, participants from all over the country have been very enthusiastic. It was originally decided to use Zeng's Garden as the venue, but fearing that the temporary guests would be crowded and insufficient to use, the venue was changed to Yushan Park (i.e., Xiaoyao You) in the west of the city, and Zeng's Garden was used as a place for guests to rest. Local people, considering that people from all sides are going to Changshu to attend the meeting, should do their best to fulfill the duty of the host. Therefore, a reception office was established in the Xilou of Yushan Park to prepare for reception matters. Participants from Shanghai will depart on Saturday and return to Shanghai the next day, or depart on Sunday and return to Shanghai on the same day, or depart on Sunday and return on Monday. There are three options, and all matters are handled by the China Travel Service. Lunch will be provided by Zeng's residence at the Zhenshixuan address to entertain the guests. A large number of people from political and academic circles in Nanjing will take the 8:00 express train to Wuxi and then drive to Changshu by road to participate. It is imagined that at that time, there will be a grand occasion of white horses and plain carriages.</p>

<h3 id="e152">Invented a Pressure Oil Lamp that Burns Domestic Oil <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Bright Light, Convenient Burning, Ministry of Industry Approves Patent for Sale</p>
<p>Available for Sale in One Month</p>
<p>Crude oil is one of the major import commodities of our country. In places where there are no electric lights in the interior, almost all kerosene lamps are used. Mr. Zhong Ling, the owner of the Hanli Company on Shandong Road in this city, who is also the inventor of the Zhongling Printing Machine, in order to stop the waste, researched with his friend Liao Fuya for two years and invented a pressure oil lamp. The lamp can burn domestic oil such as domestic rapeseed oil, soybean oil, and cottonseed oil. Because of the internal structure of the lamp, there is elastic pressure, which can keep the oil and wick level. The lamp is convenient to burn and emits bright light, which is enough to rival kerosene lamps. After the lamp was invented, it was tested and approved by the Ministry of Industry, and a patent was granted for its sale. The lamp will be available in about a month. The factory is currently located on Huade Road, Jingzhou Road for manufacturing. It is heard that there are more than ten types of lamps, and it is also learned that each lamp costs from a few cents to over one yuan. It is a truly cheap and good product and a powerful weapon for recovering rights and interests.</p>

<p>Fei Yusheng and Others Exempted from Punishment</p>
<p>Fei Keming, a real estate tycoon with assets of several tens of thousands, recently passed away due to illness. Before even 100 days had passed, his children were already fighting amongst themselves over inheritance rights. Initially, the eldest son, Yusheng, reported to the police that his younger brother, Junwen, had seized the ancestral tablet and obstructed the funeral. After the police initiated legal proceedings, Huang Junwen was sentenced to two months of imprisonment with a suspended sentence. Now, Junwen's wife, Huang, has also reported to the police that her elder brother-in-law, Fei Yusheng, his son, Qigang, and the wife of her younger uncle-in-law, Meiwen, Ms. Yang, had jointly caused her injury. The police, in accordance with the law, also filed charges. The police lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, prosecuted them in the First Special District Court on charges of assault. After a round of questioning, the details of which have been recorded in this newspaper, Judge Dai Rongduo of the Second Criminal Court continued the hearing yesterday morning and announced the verdict: Fei Yusheng and Fei Qigang were exempted from punishment for jointly causing bodily harm; Fei Yang was found not guilty.

Both parties respectfully agreed and left. This internal family feud case has thus come to an end.</p>

<p>Qian Guocheng from Beijing, who previously worked at a company in this city, became severely ill in the spring of this year and was hospitalized for more than two months before being discharged. His body and spirit were both in pain, and Qian lost his job as a result. In July, he hired three lawyers, Su Fuchou, Li Mo, and Yan Hongxi, and filed a lawsuit with the Second Special Court, citing the crime of injury under criminal law, and also attached a civil claim demanding compensation for losses and expenses totaling 5,520 yuan. The defendants were the president of the hospital, Yan Fuqing, the vice president, Liu Chongen, and the chief of surgery, Ren Linggui. The Second Special Court held that the evidence of Qian being burned was indeed true, but the person who directly burned Qian was not Ren Linggui, so the crime could not be established. In early September, the court pronounced him not guilty. Recently, Ren Linggui sued Qian for false accusation. Yesterday (October 1st) at 9:30 AM, the Third Criminal Court convened and summoned both parties for questioning. After Ren Linggui testified, Qian Guocheng testified, stating that when he was sick and went to the hospital in the spring, he personally saw Ren Linggui and Dr. Ji Changgeng both present. Later, because he was under anesthesia, he lost consciousness and could not say who performed the surgery. However, since Ren Linggui was the chief of surgery, he could not shirk responsibility, so he sued him last time. At this point, Qian presented his feet in court, showing red scars. The lawyer then made a statement, but since the defendant's lawyer had not arrived, Qian defended himself. Subsequently, Prosecutor Chen Shu expressed his opinion, stating that Ren Linggui was the chief of surgery, and Qian Guocheng had not known Ren Linggui before and had no feud with him, so it was not a false accusation. Judge Wang Cheng announced the conclusion of the debate and set the verdict for 9:00 AM on the 8th of this month.</p>

The past two days' daytime performances have been almost entirely filled by students from Wuben Girls' High School and Minli Girls' High School, leaving those who arrived later unable to buy tickets. Today is the last day, and the crowds are bound to be even larger. It is said that after completing the performances in Shanghai, the company will perform at major theaters in Nanjing and Hangzhou. It is feared that this play will not be seen again in Shanghai this year. Those who have not yet seen it should not miss this final opportunity.</p>

<p>To the Editor: We are writing to address a recent report in your newspaper's local news section regarding a theft case. The report stated that "Cheng Wenjun (also known as Wang Wenjun)" is a female performer in our company and that on September 11th, she introduced her husband, Ji Jinsheng, to also become a performer in our company, and that they went to Hangzhou on the same day to film a movie, returning on the 17th. We find this information quite perplexing. Upon investigation, we have found that there are no performers named Cheng or Ji in our company's roster. Moreover, there have been no film shoots in Hangzhou in recent months. The statements made by the criminals Ji and Cheng are clearly false. In addition to instructing our lawyer to request a thorough investigation by the court, we are clarifying the facts to ensure that your esteemed newspaper's accurate reporting is not misled by false information. We would be grateful if you could publish this letter as a correction. Sincerely, Shanghai Diantong Company, October 1st. Respectfully,</p>
<p>To the Editor: We are writing to address a report published on page 3 of your newspaper's local news section on September 30th, titled "How a Ship's Mate Drowned, Police Station Sends for Investigation". The report does not align with the facts. According to the report from the Yangsi sub-station, the incident occurred on the afternoon of September 19th. The deceased's brother, Yao Yinhai, reported the incident to the Yang Rengang outpost of the Third Division of the Water Patrol Team, who summoned the ship owner, Gong Haigen, for questioning and transferred him to the General Team, who then transferred him to the Public Security Bureau for investigation. The Water Patrol Team also ordered the local bailiff, Zhao Ketang, to report to the Shanghai Local Court, who sent personnel on the 21st to conduct an inspection and confirmed that the death was due to drowning. A notice of burial was issued. On the afternoon of the 25th at 3:00 PM, according to reports from Weng Maoxiong and Zhang Bocai, the deceased's aunt, Zhang Yao, went to Gong Haigen's home to argue, and was beaten and injured by Haigen's wife. We asked the plaintiff for details, but she only shook her head and remained silent. We immediately dispatched police and ordered the defendant to appear, but they were evading. However, since the plaintiff was over seventy years old, we sent her to the hospital for treatment first. Furthermore, on the 28th, the deceased's wife, Yao Jiang, father, Yao Boting, and brother, Yao Yinhai, went to Gong Haigen's home to demand wages and discuss matters related to the deceased's funeral, causing a disturbance. Gong Haigen's mother, Sun, along with the local bailiff Zhao Ketang, reported to the sub-station, who summoned them for mediation. Long Sun paid Yao Yinhai 17 yuan to settle the wage dispute. As for the matters related to the deceased's funeral, since a lawsuit has been filed with the court, all parties should await the court's decision. However, our station did not conduct any investigation or make any other statements regarding this case. The information in the report is likely based on rumors and is inaccurate. We are writing to request a correction to prevent any confusion. Sincerely, Tang Qiao Police Station, Pudong Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, October 1st. Respectfully,</p>
<p>To the Editor: We are writing to address a report in your newspaper today regarding news of a martial arts group performing to aid disaster relief.

<p>A Glimpse of Their Strength</p>

The second time was in 1933 for the 5th National Games, with one hundred and twenty athletes, organized by the 20th Army of Sichuan. This year, due to limited funding, there are only sixty-seven athletes, organized by the Sichuan Provincial Government, marking the first legally generated Sichuan National Games team. They are participating in seven events for the men's group: track and field, all-around, football, volleyball, tennis, and martial arts, and three events for the women's group: track and field, basketball, and tennis. Among them, male tennis players Wang Wenzhi and Qian Yaobin, and female tennis players Li Yuping and Ye Yuru, are all strong and will compete with Shanghai, Java, Hong Kong, and Shanxi.

<p>Liang Weisheng's 100-Meter Performance is Comparatively Beautiful; Women's Team Sweeps All, Performance is Quite Spectacular; Tonight, Hong Kong-Shanghai Joint Team Competes Against Westerners</p>
<p>The first act of the Sino-Western Swimming Competition, hosted by the City Swimming Pool, the first Hong Kong-Shanghai Intercity Competition, opened at the City Hall's new pool last night at 8:00 PM. Both teams are authorities in the swimming world, especially with the widespread fame of the mermaid, attracting a large crowd on Jiangwan Road. The total number of spectators was no less than a thousand. Unfortunately, there was a light rain around 7:00 PM, which became heavier, otherwise there would have been over five thousand people. The City Pool added two new floodlights the day before, making it even more magnificent. Wu Tiecheng, the mayor and chairman of the competition, along with honorary referees Li Chao, Pan Gongzhan, Jing Lun, and others, arrived at the venue around 8:10 PM and watched the competition by the pool. The entire program had eleven events, with four performances and seven official events. The Hong Kong team swept the women's events, while the Shanghai team won three out of the five men's events. Liang Weisheng also set a new city record in the 100-meter freestyle. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>General Overview of the Men's Group</p>
<p>At 8:00 PM, the rain was still drizzling. By the time the competition started, it had stopped. The first event was the men's 50-meter freestyle. Hong Kong's star Chen Zhenxing was unable to participate due to his lack of training. Shanghai's Xu Heng took the lead with an excellent start, finishing about two inches ahead of Li Luomin. The others were difficult to distinguish. Liang Weisheng focused on the 100-meter event and gave up this event, otherwise, with his score of 18.9 seconds, he would have dominated the competition. When the 100-meter freestyle started, Liang looked calm and focused. After diving into the water, he quickly surpassed the others, leading the pack. He finished with a time of one minute and 7.8 seconds, which was very beautiful and close to the national record. He finished eight meters ahead of the third-place finisher. It was a pity that Chen Zhenxing was not present, otherwise, there would have been a better record. In the 100-meter breaststroke, Jian Erjie was unable to participate due to tonsillitis. Zhong Shoujun edged out Hong Kong's Zeng Hefu by half a foot. Jian Erlian lost his position due to a mistake during the turn. In the 100-meter backstroke, Shanghai's Wei Guorui had not fully recovered from his illness and was not able to swim at his best. In the relay race, Shanghai's Xu Shouqiang swam first, but was passed by Hong Kong's Chen Qiqian. Although Jian Erming tried to catch up in the breaststroke, he was unable to close the gap. In the third leg, the Hong Kong team sent Chen Zhenxing, while Shanghai sent Liang. After diving into the water, Liang was a foot behind. They fought fiercely in the middle, but Chen gained a slight lead and won by a foot.</p>
<p>Women's and Performances</p>
<p>The Shanghai team did not win any of the three women's events, which were all won by the Hong Kong team. The mermaid's skill was truly extraordinary, attracting attention. In the 50-meter freestyle, she finished six feet ahead of her sister Xiuzhen, causing shouts and thunderous applause. In the 100-meter breaststroke, Hong Kong's Qu Enzhao was only thirteen years old, but she stood out after diving into the water. Shanghai's Zhou Xiuling tried her best to catch up, but was eleven feet behind. In the 100-meter freestyle, Shanghai's Zhu, the Yang sisters were still neck and neck before the turn, but the mermaid, who was skilled in both, swam faster and faster, finishing six feet ahead of her sister, while Chen fell behind Xiuzhen by three or four feet. The four performances were the highlight of the event. When the mermaid performed the windmill swimming, the audience erupted in applause. After diving into the water, she swam in a circle, her hands and body moving like a windmill, and the water swirled like a vortex. Chen Zhenxing's butterfly stroke was the latest American breaststroke style, with both hands thrusting forward simultaneously, the body slightly inclined, and the feet vertical, which increased the speed compared to the old style. In the diving performance, although it was fifty meters away, Chen Zhenxing Hong Erming's performance was impressive. Most people can only dive up to ten meters, but Chen had the ability and speed, and his posture was also excellent. Jian's central performance was slightly inferior. The last act was diving, which was also quite interesting.</p>

<p>— Original work by Ms. Alcott of the United States, translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>Dan sneered at their boring views, and cursed even more fiercely as he taught them new games all the way.</p>
<p>However, Tommy was still drowsy, and Ned gradually felt a headache from the effects of the beer and cigarettes, so no one was in the mood to learn, and the card game was not exciting. The light was dim, and the room was almost dark. They couldn't laugh loudly, and they couldn't encourage each other much, because Mr. Rice was sleeping in the closet next door, so everyone was lazy and couldn't cheer up. Once, while dealing cards, Dan suddenly stopped and shouted, "Who is it?" His voice showed a frightened expression, and at the same time, he used his military cloak to cover the light. In the darkness, a voice trembled, "I can't find Tommy," followed by a rush of footsteps, from that main room to the side room.</p>
<p>"It's Jo! He's going to call someone; shrink into the bed immediately, Tommy, and don't say anything." Dan shouted, and quickly erased all traces of the fun just now, and began to quickly take off his clothes, as did Ned.</p>
<p>Tommy ran to his room like a fly, and slipped into his bed in a flash, so he just lay there smiling until his hand felt burning, only to find that he was still pinching the butt of the beautiful cigar. It turned out that they were still smoking when the happy gathering was dispersed.</p>
<p>The butt of the cigar was almost burned out, but he still wanted to carefully extinguish it. Suddenly, he heard Aunt Su's voice, and he was afraid that if he put it in the bed, his secret would be revealed, so he pinched it, thinking that he had finished it, and threw it under the bed.</p>
<p>Aunt Su came in, followed by Jo. She was surprised to see Tommy lying quietly, but his face was red. Jo asked him:</p>
<p>"He wasn't there just now, I woke up, and I couldn't find him anywhere."</p>
<p>Aunt Su shook his body lightly and asked, "What are you up to, you bad child?" This made the person lying down open his eyes and say gently:</p>
<p>"I just ran to Ned's room to ask him some questions. Go away, don't nag me, I'm going to sleep."</p>
<p>After Aunt Su helped Jo sleep well, she went to inspect again, and saw two children sleeping peacefully in Dan's room. "Some little games," she thought, and since she didn't see anything wrong, she didn't tell Mrs. Fife, who was busy taking care of little Todd and was already feeling annoyed.</p>
<p>Tommy was really sleepy. He only told Jo not to interfere and not to nag anymore. Later, he was snoring loudly in less than ten minutes, never dreaming of what had happened under his bed. It turned out that the cigar had not been extinguished, but was only smoldering on the straw mat. Later, it actually caught fire. So this hungry little flame crawled up like a snake, first caught the quilt, then gradually reached the bedding, and finally the bed itself caught fire. The beer made Tommy sleep very soundly, and the smoke suffocated Jo, so they fell asleep until the fire burned their bodies, and they were in danger of being burned to death.</p>

<p>Foreign merchants and speculators aggressively selling; later rumors of the Central Bank opening caused banks to buy back, softening the market.</p>

<p>The Central Bank's posted rates revealed sterling up 0.125 and the U.S. dollar up 0.1875. Customs gold units fell by 0.013. Market sentiment was weak, and the market softened immediately after opening. Furthermore, with Sassoon and George &amp; Co. aggressively selling, there was a brief hardening, but banks seized the opportunity to buy cheaply, which helped maintain the market. The HSBC posted rates showed sterling up 0.125 and the U.S. dollar up 0.1875. The Japanese bank took advantage of the high prices to sell, but it was difficult to tighten the market. Thereafter, the situation was mediocre and lacked change. There was no movement to prepare to print silver, and the market was stable.</p>
<p>The afternoon session opened flat. Banks bought sterling and sold U.S. dollars, but there were no special changes. Unexpectedly, Chinese merchants' sentiment suddenly turned positive. Rumors circulated that the Central Bank was opening and that printing silver had not been altered. The process suddenly tightened. Banks took advantage of the high prices to aggressively sell U.S. dollars, but Chinese merchants continued to buy. George &amp; Co. aggressively sold Xianlong, while banks bought. Thus, supply and demand balanced, and the market returned to stability. The news of printing silver was reported three times at the price of one anna, but the surname (referring to the bank involved) did not loosen until the close. The near-term selling price at the close was sterling at</p>

<h3 id="e194">Securities: Bulls and Bears Compete Vigorously, Bond Market Full of Turmoil <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Major players step in to support the market; prices suddenly rebound; '96 Bonds show signs of manipulation again.</p>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the market was turbulent under environmental pressure. Bulls and bears exerted their full strength to compete with each other. Prices would suddenly plummet, then surge violently. Market prices fluctuated rapidly. Major players struggled to support the market, attempting to deepen the psychological shock of the market. Therefore, bullish attempts were often interrupted in the middle. The violent fluctuations had affected the entire market.</p>
<p>The '96 public bonds, which had been dormant, were suddenly absorbed in large quantities by the No. 46 issue, causing a price surge. Trading soared by nearly one yuan. At the close, many parties rushed to close out positions, and prices turned weak again.</p>
<p>The market process yesterday: the morning opened with the continuation of the previous closing's weak momentum, and prices continued to fall. The Shantou incident became more serious, and people were uneasy. Bullish investors were wary. Issues like 14, 20, 43, and 23 aggressively sold off, and retail investors followed the trend, causing all bonds to plummet sharply, dropping two or three jiao, even seven or eight jiao. The June issue rebounded by three jiao due to its prior excessive decline.</p>
<p>The second session's fluctuations suddenly diverged. Bulls and bears exerted their full strength. The aforementioned bonds rebounded by five fen to two jiao. The '96 bonds rose suddenly and then fell by several jiao. Salt tax bonds rebounded and then rose. The No. 23 customs bonds fell again. Fluctuations were intense, and changes were rapid.</p>
<p>At the opening of the afternoon session, the aforementioned bonds fell by three or several jiao. The No. 20 customs bonds and others were compensated, and prices rebounded by half a yuan. The No. 46 issue of the '96 public bonds was bought in large quantities, surging by nearly one yuan. At the closing, short positions rushed to close out, and issues like 4 and 21 rushed to absorb, supporting the bonds to rebound by about half a yuan. The situation was different for issues after the No. 22 customs bonds. The No. 48 issue was sold off again, and bonds fell by half a yuan again. The '96 bonds turned weak as bullish investors closed out positions.</p>
<p>Overall, the market prices for the day saw mixed ups and downs. The '96 bonds surged by eight or nine jiao. The total trading volume was approximately 30 million yuan. The following is a comparison table of the high and low results (unit: yuan):</p>
<h3 id="e195">Yarn &amp; Cotton: Yarn &amp; Cotton Market Spirited <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Three grades of yarn and cotton also rise; spot sales brisk.</p>
<p>The yarn market is trending firm, and a bullish trend is gradually rising. This is because the spot yarn sales market has been developing recently, and factories' inventories have been reduced significantly. People's confidence is particularly strong. Spot yarn selling prices are becoming increasingly solid, and Japanese yarn prices are also tight. There are news of Japanese factories in Qingdao reducing production. However, short-sellers are aware that the amount of chips in warehouses is thicker than before, so recent pressure is particularly strong. In the afternoon, Osaka's three grades of yarn surged by 5 yuan, and the market became more spirited and rose.</p>
<p>Futures yarn affected by three grades.</p>
<p>At the opening of the futures yarn market, each month still showed signs of fatigue. Due to unfavorable news, most people were bearish. However, after the second session, upon hearing that Osaka's three grades of yarn had risen by 2 yuan, people's confidence suddenly tightened. At the same time, spot yarn sales were not bad, and short-sellers covered their positions and rebounded. As a result, each month rose by 2, 3, 4, and 5 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price.</p>
<p>At the opening of the afternoon session, the market was firm and stable. New potential buyers were not enthusiastic. Eastern Seas' three grades of yarn rose step by step, and discussions in the market started again, saying that if the European war broke out, cotton yarn might skyrocket. Therefore, the atmosphere was tense at the close. As a result, each month rose by 3, 6, 8, and 1 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. The March contract jumped by 1.5 yuan at the close. Both bulls and bears were slightly concerned. Sales were approximately 650 bales of Yuechang, 700 bales of Gengfeng, 750 bales of Renfeng, 1350 bales of Changfeng, 450 bales of Dafeng, and 450 bales of Shengyuan. Purchases were 350 bales of Tongji, 350 bales of Dahu, 1600 bales of Run Kang, 1000 bales of Yongda, 350 bales of Zhenda, and 4500 bales of Changyu. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales over 1000 bales.</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still good. Statistics show that a total of 1296 bales were bought by various newspapers throughout the day. The market is firm and stable. The purchase amounts for each lender are as follows:</p>
<p>Mainland: 20 Shantou, 6 Henan, 36 Wuhu, 20 Guang, 20</p>
<p>Tianjin: 40 Jiujiang, 3 Tonghang, 30 Yun, 4280 Anqing, 30</p>
<p>Xuzhou: 43 Haizhou, 10 Changsha, 10 Jiangxi, 20 Xiamen, 35</p>
<p>Ningbo: 15 Hankou, 10</p>
<p>The cotton market was firm in the morning and strong in the afternoon. The situation is very strong. Although the number of new cotton shipments from various sources is large, consumption is also healthy. The arrival of Yao cotton is not bad, but there is still no surplus at the docks, so people are optimistic. In the afternoon, Osaka's three grades of cotton rose by 1 yuan, and the market followed suit and increased.</p>
<p>Cotton prices also soar.</p>
<p>At the opening of the futures cotton market, near-month contracts were flat. The source of peach blossoms at the docks was quite low, with more than 7,000 bales, and people were somewhat flat. However, distant Guangdong contracts were tense. After the first session, it was heard that the price of Japanese cotton had risen by 778 jiao. The buying wind in Zhangzhong was strong. By the close, bulls came to spit out again, and morale was slightly relaxed. As a result, the market was nearly flat, with a median increase of 5 fen to 1 jiao. The market surged suddenly at the opening of the afternoon session, and a bullish trend suddenly rose. Although Ningo flowers and knife goods surged, they were all sold out, and Osaka and Pinhua prices rose sharply. American cotton is expected to rise tomorrow. As a result, each month rose by one jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. Dachang sold 3000 dan, Yichang sold 2000 dan, Changfeng sold 3700 dan, Yikang sold 2300 ancestors, Changhe sold 2300 dan, Run Kang sold 2400 dan, Tonghe sold 1600 dan, and Xincheng sold 800 dan. Dahua bought 1300 dan, Sen Kang bought 2000 dan, Weiyu bought 1400 dan, Renfeng bought 1200 dan, Yuan Yi bought 1900 dan, Run Kang bought 1600 dan, Xiecheng bought 2100 dan, Taichang bought 1400 dan, and Xinheng bought 2200 dan. The lowest prices and closing prices for one day are as follows.</p>
<p>Large quantities of peach blossoms are sold.</p>
<p>Although spot cotton consumption is normal, the market is extremely firm. The sources are estimated to be 7185 bales of Yao cotton and more than 2600 bales of Tong cotton. The arrived Yao cotton is fully priced to the factory, it is said.</p>
<p>Ming cotton: 3.00 36.50 Tonghang Zhongjin 500 bales Spot warehouse delivery</p>

<p>Increased by yuan, etc.; January futures flower no movement.</p>
<p>The Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange convened a cotton yarn grade identification meeting on September 26 for the purpose of delivering futures yarn contracts for the 25th and 23rd months. As a result of the review, the grade of 20-count yarn was increased by 1.2 yuan. The grade of 20-count Japanese yarn was raised by yuan. The 16-count yarn produced only by Zhenhua Yarn Factory's Shuanglong original was reduced by 17 yuan and now lowered by one grade to a reduction of 18 yuan. The grades of the remaining 10-count yarn and the futures flower were unchanged. The grade identification results for the March futures flower are completely the same as those for the February contract, with no change. The following is a list of the changes in the procedures and brand name grade prices of cotton yarn:</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened with a drop of one to three pounds per contract month. Although the news from Liverpool was good, due to the carryover of buying over the weekend, local brokers, due to clear weather, moved the trend to the sea. There was no frost in the west, and they sold off one after another. Market prices failed to rise. The industry was the largest buyer. Demand from the Far East and the mainland was quite good. The October contract was relatively firm due to industry short covering. Speculators quietly awaited developments in Europe. Later, Southern players sold off to close out positions, while industry players bought in at limit prices. The closing was stable. Spot prices rose by 5 pounds, while futures prices rose or fell by 2 to 5 pounds. British cotton spot prices rose by 2 points, while futures prices fell by 1 point. Indian cotton European exporters sold and cross-bought, but were offset by speculators buying and covering short positions. Flat Gore rose 2 rupees, and Aumla and Bairochi rose 2.5 rupees. Original telegram recorded left (30th telegram).</p>
<p>According to a Mumbai telegram, the opening forecast for Bairochi flower on October 1 was 206 rupees, down 1 rupee from the previous day's closing.</p>

<h3 id="e198">Grains: White Machine Rice Surges Six or Seven Jiao <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Foreign rice returned from Hangzhou and Ningbo</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign Xian rice rose across the board. In addition to brisk sales on this street, there were also hoarders inquiring. Gao Ke Xian rice was fortunately competed for by actual sales on this street, and the bullish trend was particularly rampant. 885 bags of Yongjianghu white machine late new arrived and were all opened up. The price immediately soared by half a yuan and continued to rise by one or two jiao, rising six or seven jiao compared to the previous day. In addition to inquiries from the origin, the Yuan Ying was also due to rising production prices and rising prices on the Yangtze River. The competition on this street was due to the high price of the rice, which was higher than the Du Zi Jian rice from Hexia, enough to mix with Su Tong Japonica and North Japonica for sale. Other customer Xians generally followed suit, rising one or two jiao. Foreign rice was dull and gradually returned from Hangzhou. They were sold on the market at prices only a few fen and nearly one jiao. However, dealers were still holding firm. Yu Day opened 510 bags of Gan rice, 1,000 bags of Li Xian, 1,733 bags of Jing Xian, 243 bags of Jiangbei rice, 654 bags of Anqing rice, 532 bags of Zhangzhou rice, 850 bags of Saigon, 760 bags of small twisted rice, 70 bags of high Gong broken rice, and 565 bags of Siam rice. Except for a small amount of foreign rice handled in the north, all were handled by this street, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Japonica rice sales turn around again <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Each gang has slightly more sources, arriving with nearly 40 lots totaling 8,000 shi. Sales are not good because the weather is clear and the shade is suitable for planting, and there are occasional showers. However, there were many inquiries from this street, resulting in each broken Japonica rising by one or two jiao. Although the bag contained only Sijing goods, the market was also raised by Jiao Wai. As for Bai Ge Dao, yesterday's bag was healthy. It is estimated that more than 400 bags were purchased from Yantai and other gangs, so the market situation is particularly strong, and the price has risen by two or three jiao. The trial planting is similar to the fresh season. Each new Japonica rose by 3 jiao due to the scarcity of goods. New Yangjian rose by one or two jiao, and new Dujian high-quality goods also benefited. However, the ones in the central market were still flat, and Chenyin became more outstanding.</p>
<p>Up and down on 30th October 1st</p>
<p>Nangang Early Break 1.90 20.05 Up One Jiao and Half</p>
<p>Fengjing Baige 9.80 10.10 Up Three Jiao</p>
<p>Songting Break 10.10 10.50 Up Jiao</p>
<p>Xitang Yangjian 7.85 8.07 Up Two Jiao and Two Fen</p>

<p>North Tip 8.40 8.50 Up One Jiao</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 35 or 36 boats arrived from Hexia. The sales of various goods in the market were good, and transactions of broken Japonica continued, with the price increasing by nearly jiao. The sales of Dongxin Japonica were active, and the price increased by jiao Xu. The situation of Xixin Japonica was stable, and the price of thin rice was increased by jiao Wai. The price of Kiln seed was increased by two jiao due to the lack of goods. Baige also increased by one jiao. Xin Yangjian was tightly pegged to nearly Jiao. The price of Xinbu Kejian was stable and tightening, and Dujian was becoming more highly fixed. The mid-grades and secondary grades were showing signs of fatigue. The price of Baiyuan was weak, but the other goods were in a stable trend.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Flour and Wheat Follow Foreign Wheat Higher <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>The flour market shows a soaring image again. According to foreign quotations, Chicago's near-term contract rose 9.0, the distant contract rose 3.0, and Canada rose 5.0. The market is because foreign is high and the war in Italy is impossible to avoid. Therefore, the industry's unanimous enthusiasm opened prices with a high increase of three or four points. Later, due to the large absorption of standard gold gangs, the market became more tense. By the opening of the afternoon session, transactions were still brisk, and the market had already revolved. Due to the profit-taking by bullish players, the hedgers also exited, so the situation turned stable. The March contract has been opened as usual, with an initial price of 7 jiao, and the closing is also good for one and a half fen. The highest price in February was also 7 jiao zero two and a half li, which is the highest record in recent times.</p>
<p>At the opening of the wheat market this morning, the markets for each month saw a unanimous increase in price, and the momentum of foreign wheat was quite drastic, so the market was extremely lively due to this powerful movement. The opening price rose by 5, 6, or 7 fen. By the opening of the afternoon session, transactions were more smooth, and prices continued to rise sharply. For example, the increase in January and February reached a huge of 1 jiao and 1 fen. The bids for each month also opened the highest record recently. Thereafter, if the international situation is historically firm, the rising wind will also be more drastic. In the current wheat market, Fuxin has stopped some vehicles, the factory has stopped, and only 500 packages of Hankou wheat have been opened, with a price of 3.79 yuan, which Fuxin will handle, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e201">A Talk with Princess Der Ling <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— (Ji Ping)</p>
<p>The news that Princess Der Ling, the original author of our journal's long-form novel "The Fragrant Clouds of Imperial Incense," has come to Shanghai from America was announced a few days ago. I think all our readers will certainly have had their curiosity piqued about all things related to her, and can't wait to catch a glimpse of her charm. Having served Empress Dowager Cixi for over two years in the palace, she recorded the Empress Dowager's personality, hobbies, etc., in exhaustive detail. Those who love and continue to read "The Fragrant Clouds of Imperial Incense" will admire her writing ability, which is far beyond that of ordinary people. Indeed, as a woman of her caliber, she has written as many as seven or eight novels, and is still a special writer for newspapers in the United States, and she also has to return to China to search for materials for novels; that kind of spirit is worthy of admiration by writers!</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, I visited the Princess at the Cathay Hotel, wanting to offer this material to those interested. Because she was preparing to leave for Peiping, and her journey was rushed, the time to talk was very short, and what I wanted to talk about had to be left for next time. First, I must introduce what kind of person she is. In a nutshell, she is completely a Europeanized woman. Her speech, clothing, and manners are all like those of a Western woman. Of medium height, neither fat nor thin, about forty years old, but her face is still gorgeous, always exuding a gentle and pleasant expression, with not a trace of aristocratic air.</p>
<p>She said that she rarely read Chinese newspapers while staying in the United States, but after arriving in Shanghai and browsing the Shen Bao, she felt that the compilation and printing were good. In particular, the pictorial magazine was as exquisite as those in the United States, and could truly represent China's new printing industry. I told her that "The Fragrant Clouds of Imperial Incense" had been published for more than a year, and the reporter had a very good impression of it, and perhaps it would be printed as a single volume in the future. She was very happy about it. Then she said: Having left the country for eight years, seeing the scenery of Shanghai, it is very different. Coming here and talking with many old friends, she expressed her sympathy for the current situation of the motherland. She had also been to the new city center, which fully demonstrated the progress of Chinese construction. She had heard that the capital was showing new signs, and when she went north to Peiping and south, she would be able to freely travel to the scenic spots of the capital. In short, the amusement of these few days has already made a deep impression, proving that my repeated broadcasts in the United States, promoting China, are by no means all deceptive pretense.</p>
<p>Finally, she said that when she comes to Shanghai next time, she will make an appointment to talk in detail, which will surely satisfy the information for you to write. We shook hands and said goodbye.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Thirty Li by Sailboat <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Qiao Yuncan</p>
<p>Sailboats have become obsolete means of transport in our era; however, in remote towns and villages, and under special circumstances, there are still times when they are needed; that kind of elegance is something that even battleships and large freighters cannot imagine. Last time, I hurried back to my hometown from Shanghai. I was used to the thirty li of a wheelbarrow's taste, and that morning, with the light still dim, I was already sitting securely in the cart, listening to the sound of the axle pressing on the winding paths in the fields, with the rice paddies crisscrossing like embroidery, and the water-lifting devices answering with songs. A gentle breeze brushed my clothes, and I was beginning to enjoy the scene when, in an instant, dark clouds spread out, and before I knew it, a swift wind and heavy rain descended like a flying general, relentlessly attacking me! The cart puller and I really couldn't take it, so we hired a small "catch the fresh" sailboat, and I immediately abandoned the land and boarded the boat. Hilariously, it seemed that the heavens were deliberately making fun of me. Just as we raised the sail, the sun began to shine dimly again. There were three boatmen: one boss, one young apprentice, and one deckhand. The young apprentice steered, the boss rowed, and the deckhand went ashore to pull the rope, moving forward at a snail's pace. I was reminded of two sentences from a letter by Qiu Shuxuan, "Watching boats sail on the spring water is like sitting in heaven, and one does not know the hardships of the people on the boat!" Besides me, there was also a grocer on board. The boatman solemnly said, "The boat is small, and the river is wide, so it is easy to capsize. Gentlemen, please be calm and don't move around!" My weight was greater than that of the other passenger, so we moved a leather suitcase to balance things out. This is probably what is meant by "crossing the river in the same boat."</p>
<p>There were ditches and wooden signs on both sides of the bank. The boatman pulling the rope was very difficult, but he rowed the boat quickly, like an ape climbing, truly showing the skill of "a fist never leaving the hand, and a song never leaving the mouth!" Not until noon did we reach a market. We disembarked to catch our breath and ate two bowls of noodles to fill our stomachs. The small teahouse was still not open for the morning market. Next to it sat a table of tea drinkers from the town, one of whom, wearing a Zhongshan suit and sporting a small mustache, was there pontificating as if he were a modern reviewer. They did not linger. We returned to the boat, and the boatmen were also eating large pancakes to fill their stomachs, dipping their hands into the river to scoop up water to quench their thirst. That day, at dusk, we finally reached our destination.</p>
<p>Always these words! Annoying</p>

<p>— (Xin Yu)</p>
<p>The article "Errors in 'Si Lang Visits His Mother'" published in Spring and Autumn on the 27th, I fear, is due to a misunderstanding of the plot of the play. Now I will specially state its meaning below. When the Yang family and his sons were defeated, Si Lang was captured, changed his surname to Muyi, and was recruited by Xiao Bang as his son-in-law. He often missed his relatives, but could not return. When Xiao Tiansuo led his troops to fight against Xiao Bang, She Taijun escorted grain and came to the Northern Frontier. Therefore, in the lyrics of the play, there are singing lines such as: "Xiao Tiansuo, set up Tianmen, the two countries will fight, Old Lady, escorting paste, coming to the Northern Frontier." Si Lang heard that his mother had come to the north and wanted to see her very much, but he had no permit and could not pass the border. He then discussed it with the princess and designed to steal the permit, which then led to the various plots of passing the border, seeing his mother, and returning the permit.</p>

<p>Duo Cai walked to his side and gently patted his shoulder, saying, "People say you are a child, but you really act like a child? If you don't cry or make trouble, wouldn't you be a very good person? That way, you can easily gain people's favor." Yueying thought of the sentence "the bones are all his." She didn't dare to say anything more, but only lowered her head and stood quietly by his side, her hand fiddling with her own clothing buttons. Duo Cai saw that he was as docile as a sheep, and regardless of being alone there, he stroked his hair again, and even sniffed at his temples with the tip of his nose. Shi Lian saw this, and knew that Duo Cai was already happy, so he immediately held the package of cosmetics on the table with both hands, and cupped his hands towards Yueying, saying, "I'm really not offering anything special, but congratulations to the two of you on your wedding." Duo Cai smiled, "You're being too polite. Didn't you send a gift two days ago?" Shi Lian laughed, "No, there should be a distinction. That was a gift for your wedding, and this is a gift for your honeymoon. To tell you the truth, in a few days, I will also send a gift for the new wife's pregnancy." Duo Cai said, "How would you know if he is pregnant?" Shi Lian blushed and said, "Did you think I said something wrong again? If the new wife is pregnant, it will always be revealed sooner or later, so wouldn't I know?" Yueying only let them joke around, but didn't say a word. Shi Lian still placed the cosmetics on the table, and then became serious, saying, "Duo Cai, we are always close friends. If you have any difficult things, as long as I can do it, I can do it for you. I'm going to go to the new wife's house to take a look now. If you have anything, just tell me, and I will do my best."

<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of Qing, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Is it really worthwhile to expend so much manpower on artistic pursuits? Besides this, what other uses do the eunuchs have? These two questions are not easy to answer. But in my opinion, the answer to the first question should be positive; because if so much manpower wasn't spent, how could more than three thousand pots of colorful and pleasing chrysanthemums bloom? Moreover, these chrysanthemums can at least bring some joy to the Empress Dowager, which makes it very worthwhile!</p>
<p>Chapter 34: Jade Body Stretched Out</p>
<p>When I first entered the palace as an attendant lady-in-waiting by the Empress Dowager's decree, I naturally felt constrained and awkward in everything I did. The most difficult thing was the matter of bathing. Because my sister and I had lived abroad for a long time, we had developed a habit of bathing every day. Unfortunately, I didn't ask my father about this beforehand, so after entering the palace, I deeply felt the inconvenience the next morning. My sister and I searched for a long time, but couldn't find a set of bathing utensils in the huge palace. Perhaps the palace maids and eunuchs each had these things, but they only used them privately, and didn't dare to bring their own for us to use. Helpless, we had to endure it for the time being. But I felt very puzzled. Could it be that the other ladies-in-waiting who came before us didn't bathe all year round? Or could it be that they all went home to bathe? Then what about Longyu and Consort Jin? (420)</p>

<p>— Allegory</p>
<p>There was a Mrs. Li living in the east neighborhood. She had an eighteen-year-old daughter who went out every day dressed coquettishly. But people rarely saw her when she came back, because she was a dancer. Doing this profession did bring in a lot of income, at least two or three hundred yuan a month. Mrs. Li would always smile gleefully when she talked about her daughter.</p>
<p>There was a Mrs. Wang living in the west neighborhood. She had a son. She painstakingly nurtured him until he graduated from middle school, but after graduation, he couldn't find a job for two years. Mrs. Wang ran around, asking relatives and friends to find a position for her son. Until now, he has finally found a job as an accounting assistant in a department store. Her son works diligently, going out early and returning late, but he only earns eighteen yuan a month. Mrs. Wang thought that Mrs. Li in the east neighborhood didn't teach her daughter much, and heard that she didn't even graduate from elementary school. Now she is a dancer, and her monthly income is more than ten times that of her middle school graduate son. She couldn't help but sigh with emotion, saying, "It's better to give birth to a daughter than a son." —</p>

<h3 id="e207">日本的迎神賽會 (Japanese Festival) <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Kichiun</p>
<p>Anyone who hasn't been to Japan wouldn't believe that the Japanese are more superstitious than we are. In addition to the household gods in every home, stone Jizo Bodhisattvas can be seen everywhere. In the countryside, on the banks of fields and next to outhouses, you can see several stone Buddhas that are three feet tall. The shrines are very large, with two or three in each district. They are like our ancestral halls, probably enshrining the emperors and past sages of Japan. University students in square hats, gentlemen in Western suits, also put their hands together and pay their respects and give alms there.</p>
<p>Each shrine has a specific festival day, lasting for three days before and after, as lively as our temple fairs. At night, the streets are full of vendors selling toys and goods. So when the festival arrives, it is a happy day for children. Each household hangs a round paper lantern outside the door, with a cluster of paper flowers on it, which are hung by people sent by the neighborhood association. Both items cost one yuan and two jiao. Roughly, one lantern is hung per house. Shops with larger frontages hang two or more lanterns.</p>
<p>On the festival day, the shrine's hall is brightly lit with candles. Two flagpoles are erected outside the door, with colored ribbons hanging from them. Outside the hall are five long banners, with dragons, phoenixes, turtles, and qilin embroidered on the red silk. The middle one is embroidered with five butterflies, probably representing "five bats bringing blessings." Pearl curtains hang low inside the hall, and the contents are unknown. Next to the hall is a stage, only shoulder-high, with three people playing drums and flutes. A woman is wearing a white gauze dress with a bright red underskirt. She has a copper hoop on her head, and her hair is tied into braids with white paper. Sometimes she holds a tin staff, sometimes a bow and a fan. She is performing on stage to the music, without uttering a sound, probably a drama to entertain the gods.</p>
<p>The neighborhood association is a community organization formed by the residents of the neighborhood, managing streetlights and sanitation, and the festival is also an important task. A high platform is set up at the entrance of the alley, with five people sitting on it, one playing a small gong, one playing a flute, and the rest mostly playing drums. It is the pure sound of Japanese entertainment for the gods. It looks like the Taiping ritual played in Shanghai's alleys. The music sounds like the drummers in a funeral home in our country, which is quite amusing. A reed mat shed is set up on the open ground to serve as the festival's office and hall. In the middle is enshrined a deity tablet written on white paper, and on the offering table are two bottles of wintergreen leaves, with foot-long white paper rolls inserted in copper vases, like a pair of white candles. Gifts sent by nearby shops and residents, foot-wide steamed buns and pink pastries, are all placed in high-legged wooden plates. Gifts include watermelons, pears, apples, squid, etc. Those who send cash have their names and amounts posted on the wall, which is the same as in our country. A large copper drum and a palanquin are also placed in the reed shed, which are important items for the festival.</p>
<p>Large copper drums are found in temples in our country, with frames, railings, and four casters underneath. The palanquin is like our incense pavilion, with a brass phoenix on top and copper bells hanging all over the corners. It is finely carved and lacquered with gold and black paint. There are many carrying poles, usually displayed in the shrine on wooden benches. The inside of the pavilion is empty, allowing it to sway freely when carried. These copper drums and palanquins are very expensive, costing over a thousand yuan, which is not surprising. Palanquins are divided into two sizes, the small ones are only three or four feet square, carried entirely by twelve or thirteen-year-old children, which is very interesting.</p>
<p>During the festival, the first person carries two pieces of wood, striking them to direct the procession forward. Several other people carry tin staffs like those of the Mulian monks, the purpose of which is unknown. Next comes the copper drum, pulled slowly by dozens of five or six-year-old children wearing beautiful clothes and white socks. Their heads are either covered with paper hats or tied with colored cloth. One person beats the drum, striking it three times on the drum and then three times on the side, repeating this cycle. Behind the copper drum is the palanquin, carried by twenty or thirty boys, each shouting "Ya! Ya!" The palanquin does not proceed in a straight line, and everyone can freely rush east and west, going from the upper street to the lower street, often rushing into people's gates or knocking down pedestrians. Especially when passing through the bustling streets, in addition to the horses and carriages stopping at any time, there are several policemen in white clothes who follow them all day long to supervise them. The girls pulling the copper drum are too young, and some are led by their mothers and sisters, and those who can't walk sit in the copper drum frame to rest.</p>
<p>Some people prepare several buckets of cold water at the door, waiting for the palanquin to come and pour it over everyone's heads. Then many "drenched chickens" carry the palanquin, rushing around and playing. Sometimes they shake the palanquin up and down, but fortunately the palanquin is sturdy and there is no danger of it being damaged.</p>

<p>— Lingjing</p>
<p>I think when people are most troubled, it is best to read history. Because the phenomena you see now or the things you encounter yourself certainly have precedents in history. The so-called "there is nothing new under the sun" is at least 90% true. If you don't believe it, look:</p>
<p>Historical Records, Biography of Li Shang: "Shang's son, Ji, styled Kuang, was on good terms with Lü Lu. When Empress Dowager Gao died, the ministers wanted to kill the Lü clan. Lü Lu was a general, stationed in the Northern Army. Grand Commandant Zhou Bo was not allowed to enter the Northern Army, so he sent someone to kidnap Li Shang, ordering his son Kuang to deceive Lü Lu. Lü Lu believed him, so he went out with him. Then Grand Commandant Zhou Bo waited to enter and seize the Northern Army, and then killed the Lü clan. That year, Shang died and was given the posthumous title of Marquis Jing. His son Ji succeeded him as marquis. The world called Li Kuang a seller of friendship."</p>
<p>This is a historical fact from the Han Dynasty. Sima Qian seems to disapprove of Li Kuang's actions, angrily commenting that he sold his friendship. In fact, this was Zhou Bo's cunning plan. If Li Kuang had not been moved that day, his father would not necessarily have been killed by Zhou Bo. Perhaps Li Kuang did not see this at first. He only compared the relationship between father and son and the relationship between friends, and felt that it was always worth exchanging a friend's life for his father's life, so he resolutely followed Zhou Bo's plan. Ban Gu praised Li Kuang's actions as "loyalty to the ruler and parents," which is absolutely not to be blamed. However, Su Dongpo greatly disapproved of Ban Gu's defense. See Su Lao's Dongpo Zhilin:</p>
<p>"Ban Gu said, 'During the time of Emperor Xiaowen, the world considered Li Ji to be a seller of friendship. Selling friendship means seeing profit and forgetting righteousness. If Ji's father was a meritorious official and was also threatened, destroying Lü Lu to secure the state, loyalty to the ruler and parents is acceptable.' Dongpo said, 'At that time, Ji had to sell his friend. The fault lies in being the son of a meritorious official and associating with a national traitor, and being on good terms with him. Shi Que's son Hou associated with Zhou Yu. Que forbade him, but he did not listen and was eventually killed. The gentleman did not criticize him, saying that he extinguished relatives for righteousness. Li Shang's virtue is not as good as Shi Que, so Ji was spared from death. He was a lucky man of ancient times, and Gu is eager to wash away the stain of selling friendship. Gu's righteousness is shallow!'"</p>
<p>I think Ban Gu's defense is quite biased. Although the Lü clan was guilty and heinous as national traitors, Li Kuang certainly did not see this. Otherwise, he would not have associated with them. Therefore, Li Kuang's motive was based solely on a concept of family ties. The concept of the state did not exist. Ban Gu praised him as "loyalty to the ruler and parents," which naturally aroused Su Lao's usual indignation. Things like this are not uncommon in history, but there are some differences. For example, Li Zhu's selling of friendship was forced by circumstances. There was also Wang Dao's selling of Zhou Qi in the Jin Dynasty, which was entirely due to misunderstanding. Biography of Zhou Qi:</p>
<p>"When Wang Dun raised troops, Liu Wei advised the emperor to remove all the princes. Sikong Dao led his subordinates to the palace to plead guilty. He met Zhuan entering, and Dao called to Qi, saying, 'Boren, I entrust the lives of my entire family to you.' Zhuan went straight in without looking back. After seeing the emperor, he said that Dao was loyal and sincere, and pleaded for him greatly. The emperor accepted his words. Zhuan was happy, drank wine and went out drunk. Dao was still at the door and called to Qi again. Qi did not speak to him, but looked around and said, 'This year we will kill all the traitorous slaves and take gold seals as big as dippers to tie to our elbows.' After coming out, he submitted a memorial to the emperor, speaking very urgently about Dao. Dao did not know that he had saved him, and resented him greatly. After Dun achieved his ambition, he asked Dao, 'Zhou Qi has a reputation for being an outstanding talent in both the north and south. He should be promoted to the Three Dukes without any doubt.' Dao did not answer. He asked again, 'If he is not promoted to the Three Dukes, should he be made my subordinate?' He did not answer again. Dun said, 'If not, I will execute him!' Dao was silent again. Later, Dao checked the old records of the Secretariat and saw Qi's memorial, which pleaded for him earnestly and sincerely to the emperor. Dao held the memorial and wept, unable to control himself. He told his sons, 'Although I did not kill Boren, Boren died because of me. In the realm of the underworld, I owe this good friend!'"</p>
<p>This is a famous story. From Wang Dao's life and actions, we know that it was indeed due to a misunderstanding. Therefore, people still often use Wang Dao's two words of repentance as a self-redemption for unintentionally betraying a friend.</p>
<p>The two stories above, one due to force and the other due to misunderstanding, I think can still be given some degree of understanding. Only Yang Shan's selling of Zhang Pu in the Ming Dynasty makes me feel some "unforgivable" resentment.</p>
<p>Biography of Wang Yu: "Once, he studied under Fang Xiaoru. At that time, an imperial decree ordered the destruction of Fang Xiaoru's collection of writings, saying, 'Anyone who dares to collect it will be punished as a traitor!' The compiler Zhang Pu liked Xiaoru's writings and kept some at home. He spoke privately with his friend Yang Shan, and Shan borrowed them to read. He secretly reported it to the court. The emperor was angry and executed Pu in the market, while Shan was promoted to official. From then on, the world felt sorrow."</p>

<p>— Shen Shengshi</p>
<p>Again it is the season of lament,</p>
<p>Life is painted with weariness in the autumn wind;</p>
<p>Desolate life,</p>
<p>Thin poetic thoughts,</p>
<p>Hopeless days wither away with the fallen leaves.</p>
<p>Under the cool twilight starlight,</p>
<p>Crickets cry under the wall of the old house;</p>
<p>It is the same scene as the year before last,</p>
<p>A lonely heart,</p>
<p>Wanders in the twilight of insect sounds.</p>

<p>— Originally written by George Bernard Shaw, translated by Ting</p>
<p>——Did you even say one word in my defense?</p>
<p>——But don't you realize what will happen if you separate from her? You will lose the power to control her, and you will have to get a divorce.</p>
<p>——I don't have the power to control her now.</p>
<p>At this time, a clerk came in and said:</p>
<p>——A lady has come to see you, sir. He said emotionally, she is a very beautiful lady. Ah... sir. If she is in some trouble, please help her. If she is accused of something, please don't believe a word anyone says. I can guarantee her innocence with my own life.</p>
<p>The lawyer was almost speechless with surprise;</p>
<p>——Good... good! Really. Zhi Pi Jun! He calmed down slightly and said, what is her name?</p>
<p>——I forgot to ask her name, sir.</p>
<p>——Perhaps make an effort to remedy this oversight.</p>
<p>——I almost didn't dare to ask her, sir. It seemed like a kind of blasphemy. But I think—I hope—she will forgive me. Then he went outside.</p>
<p>The litigant said:</p>
<p>——She is my wife. She used to have feelings for that young madman. —The End—</p>

<p>— Moying</p>
<p>I left Batavia in October, on the same hot days as usual. A rickety motorcar carried two desolate pieces of luggage, and sitting inside silently watching them were me and Genwu—one person seeing me off. Perhaps feeling that such silence was too terrible, Genwu took out his usual Elephant Brand cigarette, handed me one, borrowed a match from the Javanese driver, and lit it. A puff of gray smoke escaped from his mouth, disappearing in the dry weather. Then, as if it had reached a point where he had to say something, he pinched the half-smoked cigarette between his fingers and said in a low, weak voice that seemed tired from overwork:</p>
<p>"It's good for a person to go to a few more places. You're not young anymore, and there's no better opportunity for you to stay in Ji City... cough, but... you don't have enough experience, so you should be extra careful on the road. If you can meet a reliable person on the ship, like a fellow villager..."</p>
<p>"Yes, I think so too," I said. "Genwu, I'm a little scared. It's always a little... a little... to go to an unfamiliar place. The job you've already introduced me to: and it's also a Dutch territory, so it won't be troublesome to go ashore or anything, which makes me feel much more at ease."</p>
<p>"You can rest assured!" Genwu patted me on the shoulder.</p>
<p>We fell silent again. The car was really rickety, constantly shaking on the flat asphalt road to the port. Sweat trickled down my forehead, and the heat of the white light penetrated the car canopy, steaming our bodies. When the car arrived at the port—Tanjung Priok—I was almost completely soaked.</p>
<p>Not long before the ship was due to sail, after putting the luggage in the cabin, we sat down here.</p>
<p>"You have to keep an eye on the luggage, you know?" Genwu said.</p>
<p>"Yes. There are all kinds of people on the ship, so I should..." I replied to him, thinking in my heart, sitting in the steerage, the air is so bad, how can I bear it? What if I need to go up to the deck to get a breath of fresh air?</p>
<p>"But it would be good to find someone I know," Genwu continued.</p>
<p>I also hoped that a friend would unexpectedly appear here. I constantly looked around, paying special attention to anyone who walked past me. After half an hour, all we met were Javanese chattering in Javanese, Chaozhou people wearing padded jackets, and Bombay people wearing Turkish-style red-tasseled hats. The fact proved that our hopes could not be realized: I gritted my teeth, prepared to fully taste the bitterness of the trip, what else could I do?</p>
<p>The ship's whistle blew sharply, a burst of commotion, and most of the people seeing us off went down one after another.</p>
<p>"Genwu, goodbye."</p>
<p>"Goodbye! Write a letter immediately when you get there, you know?"</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>The sky had already darkened when we left Tanjung Priok port. Looking out from the small round window in the steerage, a deep blue sea was waving up and down. Although the wind at sea was strong, it couldn't reach us here. A smell of lacquer and the stench coming up from the cargo hold made people want to vomit. The electric light was yellow, illuminating the sallow faces and blue faces of the surrounding passengers. The women's hair was disheveled; some were simply like nightshades, with only the terrifying eyes that had lost their spirit and were sunk into their sockets. Then, without knowing which child started crying, crying so loudly that it made people feel extra annoyed. Sitting uncomfortably, I lay down on the hard iron plate, with an old mat resisting its coldness. I wanted to sleep, so I spent the night...</p>
<p>I really don't know when I fell asleep. When I woke up the next day, the ship had already left Batavia far behind. I took a face towel to the faucet to wash my face, thinking that there shouldn't be any danger to the luggage if I walked away for a while, so I dragged my shoes and walked up there.</p>
<p>Only a thin, long person with a buzz cut was brushing his teeth at the tap. The morning weather was very cool and the wind was strong, making me shiver when I walked in front of him. That person stopped what he was doing, looked up at me, and said with his mouth covered in white toothpaste foam:</p>
<p>"Is it very cold?"</p>
<p>Authentic native dialect!</p>
<p>This shocked me. I looked at this fellow villager, but he was very unfamiliar, as if I had never seen him before. I stood there, forgetting to wash my face.</p>
<p>"Not washing your face?"</p>
<p>After being reminded, I bent down, stretched out the face towel to the tap, wrung it out for a while, and wiped my face.</p>
<p>"You're also from XX, right?" I asked.</p>
<p>"That's right. I heard you speaking XX in the steerage yesterday. I wanted to greet you, but I was too embarrassed. Are you alone?" After saying that, he took a sip of water, gargled, and spat it into the sea.</p>
<p>"I'm alone. What about you?"</p>
<p>"Same as you." He was about to leave. But he said again: "Speaking of which, we're fellow villagers. So how can you not be lonely?"</p>
<p>"How can I not be lonely? It would be good if someone was together, not to mention anything else, it would be easier to pass the days by just talking."</p>
<p>"Then let's go down together."</p>
<h3 id="e212">水上夜曲 (Nocturne on the Water) <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Liang Qijun</p>
<p>An evening haze with the melancholic fragrance of lilacs slowly, gently, rose from the river. Gradually it spread further towards both banks.</p>
<p>Poplar trees, shrubs, reeds by the riverbank, a small bridge, an ancient city wall, all sketched out rough lines in a blurry pale gray. From these things, one could feel a kind of melancholy that sighed for the lateness of the hour.</p>
<p>Ya Heng's small boat had just slipped out of the bridge hole when Ya Ji hooked it with his long bamboo pole for punting the boat.</p>
<p>She shook her hand and said softly:</p>
<p>"Don't wake up Mom."</p>
<p>That one just smiled...</p>
<p>When the two boats were moving side by side, Ya Ji jumped over to the boat and embraced Ya Heng's full, mature body.</p>
<p>The boat moved violently, and Ya Ji's voice trembled as he spoke:</p>
<p>"You—are making—making me suffer so much."</p>
<p>Inside the cabin, there was the sound of turning over. He loosened his hands, and she took the opportunity to break free, slipped from the bow to the stern, and from the stern jumped onto his boat.</p>
<p>Spring flowers were blooming in Ya Ji's heart.</p>
<p>The intense color of the night deepened.</p>
<p>Only shadowy black shapes remained of the blurred outlines made of rough lines.</p>
<p>The moon hung high in the velvety soft sapphire-blue sky. The stars were smiling. The river caressed the edges of the boats, softly singing a serenade that could barely be heard.</p>
<p>The two sat side-by-side on the stern of the boat; four large thighs that had been sun-baked to a rose color made circles in the still water.</p>
<p>"Look." Ya Ji put one arm around Ya Heng's waist; one finger pointed at the horizon. "Tonight is the Qixi Festival. That bright, sparkling star is the Weaving Maid Star, and the one that is closely attached to it is—"</p>
<p>"The Cowherd Star?"</p>
<p>"Ah, yes, you're really smart. Little girl."</p>
<p>Ya Ji was pleased.</p>
<p>The blush on Ya Heng's face extended all the way to her ears.</p>
<p>After a long time, restless emotions could not withstand the erosion of silence.</p>
<p>Ya Ji spoke.</p>
<p>"Didn't your mother say that after I get rich, she would marry you to me?"</p>
<p>"No, my mother wants me to marry a rich man." Ya Heng said, pouting her small mouth. "You are as poor as we are..."</p>
<p>"But..."</p>
<p>Ya Ji took out two sparkling white silver dollars from his pocket.</p>
<p>"I like this." Ya Heng snatched them away.</p>
<p>"I like this—" Ya Ji's voice trembled again.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Ya Heng's long string of laughter was so seductive that the river was also moved. The small boat trembled, and the river gently soothed it.</p>
<p>A few small ferries were moored haphazardly at the foot of the city wall. An old woman poked her head out of the cabin.</p>
<p>"That boy from that family, what a shameless thing."</p>
<p>The river softly sang, the stars smiled, the moon shone.</p>
<p>It was autumn.</p>
<p>A cool autumn wind was blowing, but the autumn wind was still young.</p>

<h3 id="e213">A Plea for Renji Hospital <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>Reports state that Shanghai Renji Hospital, after 91 years of dedicated service, is facing exceptional financial difficulties due to the current economic downturn. It is said that last year, the hospital, recognizing the difficulty in maintaining operations, made every effort to reduce all expenditures. However, on one hand, resources are scarce and income has decreased. On the other hand, demand exceeds supply, and expenses have actually increased. As a result, there is a shortfall of over 20,000 yuan, causing the authorities to feel the pain of having insufficient resources. This is a matter that deserves great concern.</p>
<p>Shanghai has several hospitals founded by foreigners, such as Renji, Guangren, Guangci, and the Women and Children's Hospital. They are established with benevolent intentions and offer very low fees to those seeking treatment, and in some cases, even provide free medical care and medicine. Their benefits to the common people are immense. Everyone knows that poor people living in Shanghai cannot afford to get sick. They certainly cannot afford doctors who charge two or three yuan for a consultation, nor can they afford medicine that costs one or two yuan per dose. Therefore, the general poor and working classes rely on these charitable hospitals for their health security.</p>
<p>Shanghai has many famous doctors and national experts, and at least several large-scale, well-equipped hospitals. However, most of them are aristocratic doctors or hospitals, catering only to a small number of wealthy individuals. The cost of their medical care and medicine is significantly higher compared to charitable hospitals. For example, Renji Hospital only charges 15 copper coins for an outpatient consultation. Inpatient care in a general ward costs only 60 cents a day, including all expenses for food, medical care, and medicine. For major surgeries, a small fee is charged based on the patient's ability to pay, and those who are completely destitute receive free treatment. This truly benefits the common people greatly.</p>
<p>However, the funding for charitable hospitals comes from donations from various sectors of society. Recently, it has been reported that not only is Renji Hospital facing financial difficulties, but other hospitals established by foreigners are also struggling to survive due to dwindling resources. This will have a significant impact on the welfare of the public. The only way to alleviate this situation is to hope that members of society will generously provide financial assistance. This will not only benefit the poor individuals but also benefit society as a whole. The occurrence of disease is a small matter in relation to the pain suffered by individuals but a large matter in relation to public health. For example, Renji Hospital sees as many as 200,000 patients a year. Imagine what would happen if these 200,000 patients were not treated by Renji Hospital and were left to lie down and moan. If some of their illnesses were contagious, the peace and tranquility of society would be unimaginable. This is not only a matter of the health of 200,000 ordinary people. Shanghai philanthropists should pay attention to this and provide practical assistance.</p>

<p>— Shi Xi</p>
<p>Stealthily, stealthily, like a timid rat, I lingered in these corners.</p>
<p>The night was as calm as a pool of stagnant water; it was the late autumn season.</p>
<p>In a window corner reflecting a faint green light, several slender figures were still flickering, and a low song could be heard overhead:</p>
<p>"Tomorrow, you beautiful tomorrow!..."</p>
<p>"Tomorrow"? I murmured softly, "That's still far away!" And then I became angry. The road was bleak, and a faint, indifferent light was blinking like sleepy, bloodshot eyes. I glared at it angrily, shook my fist, and muttered: "Tomorrow? You ghost! Remember, it's tomorrow!..."</p>
<p>I felt so exhausted, and the coldness flowed freely and unrestrainedly in the dark corners. I shivered slightly. "Go to hell!" I muttered angrily to myself, patting myself with my fist in defiance.</p>
<p>Dragging my silent steps, I disappeared again into a dark corner. A strong, pungent odor wafted over, and I frowned and stood still.</p>
<p>"I heard a soft sigh. Yes, a very weak sigh!" I thought to myself, fixed my eyes, and searched in the darkness.</p>
<p>A pile of garbage. "Yes, that's it: overflowing with the stench!" I stared at it blankly for a while before I saw a young man, dressed in rags and emaciated, lying next to it. He was curled up like a worm, clutching a broken tin can with his withered hands. He was mumbling in his sleep, his voice so weak that it made one's heart tremble: "Give me something to eat!..."</p>
<p>"Go to hell! This is also a place to sleep"? I frowned angrily and took a step closer to him.</p>
<p>He was sighing softly, and after a while, he weakly cried out: "Give me something to eat! Just a little bit, enough to fill a crack in my teeth!" As he spoke, he feigned tearless sobs.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>"Still pretending, damn it!" I thought to myself and couldn't help but sneer. So I tiptoed closer and kicked him lightly on the buttocks, shouting loudly: "Damn it! Go to hell!" His thin body trembled slightly and he woke up.</p>
<p>"Ah!..." he exclaimed in surprise, opening his sleepy eyes, and prepared to jump up suddenly and stride away.</p>
<p>I quickly stopped him and said: "Don't move!" He obediently huddled up and trembled slightly.</p>
<p>"Damn it! What kind of dream were you having"? I cursed him loudly and then laughed coldly.</p>
<p>"Ah! God knows what's going on? Maybe I dreamed again that a wealthy gentleman secretly slipped a silver dollar into my hand. Really, I keep dreaming that someone is giving me a silver dollar... But when I wake up, there's nothing, nothing..." After saying this, he sadly hung his head and secretly stared at me fixedly with his bloodshot eyes. After a while, he turned to the street lamp at the corner, blinked his eyes in anger, yawned resentfully, lay down, and fell asleep again.</p>
<p>I felt a wave of lonely melancholy in my heart, murmured softly: "Go to hell!" and stepped away towards the dim light.</p>

<p>— Meng Hua</p>
<p>Recently, due to some unexpected event, I lost over a hundred books.</p>
<p>Books have always been a luxury for me. For someone who has difficulty even solving their daily living, buying books, especially foreign books, is really an excessive desire. However, when reading is as necessary to me as eating and sleeping in my daily life, and when the books you want to read cannot be found in even the so-called well-equipped libraries, I have no choice but to find ways to exchange the money I saved from eating, clothing, and rent for the books I want to read. In the process, I changed from having meals provided to cooking for myself, from living in an apartment to living in a people’s house, wore my gown until it was tattered, and even tried hard to quit smoking, saving as much money as possible. All of this was for the sole purpose of buying the books I wanted to read. Over the past three years, I have bought over a hundred books and magazines. Although this is pitifully few, I have at least made my best effort.</p>
<p>Because of the difficulty in getting opportunities to buy books, I was very careful when buying them. When I had free time after work, I would take the time to go to the market or the book stalls, trying my best to find the books I wanted to read in the piles of old books. Sometimes I would spend three or four hours without finding a single book worth buying. Even if I found one I liked, I would have to bargain with the clerks. Therefore, obtaining these books not only cost me all the money I had saved, but also took a lot of my energy. Not to mention my detailed notes and annotations.</p>
<p>However, the books that I exchanged for my hard work, now not one is left. Perhaps they have fallen into the hands of old book dealers, or perhaps they have been torn down to wrap peanuts. Maybe they will be placed on the desks of young masters as a not-so-rare decoration, or maybe they have long been buried in the fire. Thinking of these things, I feel unspeakable pain.</p>
<p>I remember once a friend in misfortune wanted me to visit him and asked me to give him something to eat. At that time, I had not a penny in my pocket, so I had to take a copy of "Crime and Punishment" to sell. When the owner of the old bookstore looked at it and offered me a price of forty cents, I felt so angry in my heart. Later, I finally added something else to exchange for a dollar, and bought my friend what he needed. If I had known that these books would have such a day, why didn't I sell them all and let my friend, who was suffering from all kinds of punishments, get more material enjoyment?</p>
<p>Now I have finally moved to this place where I have no relatives. In a corner of a building, surrounded by the noise of the market. In the morning, the sound of the barrows rolling on the stone road wakes me up, and then I begin to wait for dusk. The smell of the tannery next door, where sheepskin is made, blows in with the hot wind and fills my small room, making it unbearable to vomit. In addition, there is only the buzzing of flies and the knocking of the delivery guy. I have nothing to do all day, either immersed in the sea of meditation or greedily reading the old newspapers pasted on the wall. If I had a book or a magazine at this time, wouldn't it be more lovely than a good friend? But I don't have a single book!</p>
<p>In this way, my indignation and hatred grow with the memories of losing my books.</p>
<h3 id="e217">On the Road <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Xi</p>
<p>Wen pointed to the square city by the setting sun: "Fangcheng is here." In the dust sinking in the sunset, I saw the old small enemy building, and my heart was naturally happy. I suggested to Wen that we should rest in Fangcheng for a while. My stomach was really hungry. I walked for almost twelve hours, eating only five or six boiled eggs in the middle. I hoped that Fangcheng would arrive early so that I could rest for a while; but the road was always so long, without a head or a tail, high stretching up the hillside, low lying in the ravine, always like this; we doubted whether we had lost our direction, otherwise why hadn't the calculated Fangcheng arrived yet? It was dust, it was wind, it was tiredness, and the whole body was like this, and it was time to wash off the dust and rest.</p>
<p>Looking forward to the early arrival of Fangcheng, I thought of a poem: Drinking horses crossing autumn water, the water is cold and the wind is like a knife, the sun has not set on the flat sand, and the dark Linhuai is seen... I had the mood of a frontier soldier.</p>
<p>On both sides of the road were sorghum fields, and the dense shadows slanted by the setting sun stretched very far, very far. Some of the sorghum had been cut, and the remaining stalks had not been pulled out, which made me think of rows of swords and guns, and we were also somewhat like an expeditionary army. In the distance, someone was driving away the sparrows: Ah! Ah! The sparrows took off, chirping and noisy, turning in a large group on the top of the sorghum, which was also quite beautiful.</p>
<p>Looking at the half-collapsed ancient enemy building of Fangcheng, my heart felt quite kind. When people are too lonely, even a bird or beast feels kind; after hurrying on the empty road for almost twelve hours, all I encountered were dilapidated villages, earthen yellow dilapidated walls, and half-dead willows, how lonely! Although it was just a small city tower, but that heroic posture like an ancient general, rising up in the wilderness as if unwilling to be lonely, gave me a lot of comfort.</p>
<p>At this time, Jiao felt quite excited. I really admired his interest. He looked at the top of the building and hummed Beijing opera: "...First, Ma Di has no courage and little talent, and second, the generals are not harmonious, and then they lost Jieting..." He kept humming until "If you don't come, come, come, please come upstairs and listen to me play the zither" and placed me in another kind of imagination. The vigorous tone disappeared into the twilight, and we entered the city.</p>
<p>It was really tiring, and the blisters on my feet had already broken. When I sat down on the earthen plank outside the small teahouse, my whole body felt sore and lazy, and my thighs were even more painful! Thinking that there was still a long forty miles to go, and looking at the setting sun on the top of the mountain, I really didn't want to go any further; but the toughness of the young people still made us want to go forward. When I pulled up my sore and numb legs, I privately nailed a sentence in my heart: "Swallowing the bitterness in my heart in loneliness, go." So I walked out of Fangcheng with the setting sun on my back.</p>
<p>Looking at the watch, it was half past six, and we had been walking for twelve hours. I thought to myself that it would probably be half an hour before it got dark. Looking back, the setting sun had entered the mountain; "We have to get to Taiping Village before dark." I said, and quickened my pace. The road was extremely bad, the wind scraped the sorghum, rustling, and our footsteps were also rustling, as if someone was following behind. The setting sun had entered the mountain, and there was a sunset glow in the sky; the top of the mountain accepted the sunset glow, reflecting each other differently, which was quite beautiful; but we were not in the mood to appreciate it, and we still had a long way to go.</p>
<p>Passing Taiping Village, it was completely dark. Taiping Village was so peaceful that there was not a single light, and the scattered earth houses looked like piles of earth under the stars. There was no human voice, no barking of dogs. I have experience of passing through villages at night, I have heard the lights shooting out from the bottom of the door, and I have heard the village dogs inquiring about the guests from afar; none of these were in Taiping Village, which was beyond my expectations, and I have never seen such a dead village.</p>
<p>The dead silence made us scared. We were walking while watching the stars. The road was always so long, without a head or a tail. We were waiting for the moon. The date was the eighteenth of the lunar calendar, and the moon should be coming up soon. We sat on the earthen pile by the roadside smoking cigarettes, waiting for the moon to hurry on the road. The wilderness was silent, and the small insects chirped, making it even more lonely. In the distance: the higher black shadows were trees, the lower ones were patches of crops, and even further was a blur. I thought to myself that this was probably the most beautiful time in the poor countryside, all the dead and dilapidated scenery was hidden under the night, and it should be the most beautiful time. If it were daytime, the scorching sun would be burning, and the crops would look like fire from afar, and the dust would be higher than the sky no matter where they were, and the people who managed the vehicles and horses would be covered in dust, struggling in the dust under the scorching sun like earthworms, which was a portrayal of the lives of the residents in this area! These are not visible at night.</p>
<p>The bright moon comes out of Tianshan, and the vast sea of clouds... Seeing the moonlight in the distant mountains, I recalled the ancient poems I learned when I was in elementary school, and treading on the moonlight, I hurried forward again.</p>

China, with more than four thousand years of history, has a long culture. A nation of four hundred million people, diligent, thrifty, gentle and kind. Emperors of all dynasties who followed the people prospered, and those who opposed the people perished. Foreign races were assimilated, the nation grew stronger day by day, and the territory grew wider. Became the only great power in East Asia. Unfortunately, the diplomacy of the Qing Dynasty was improper, causing wild and savage foreign races to be rampant! Loss of rights and land, leaving behind disasters. Soft deception and hard robbery, like tigers and wolves. The Qing court authorities were perfunctory and absurd. People of lofty ideals rose up to save the country from danger. Our Premier, for the revolution, ran around and advocated. Loyal and brave martyrs, for the revolution, fought and were wounded and killed. Iron and blood, made a brand new democratic country. Iron and blood, created today's Double Tenth Festival. Double Tenth Festival, never forget, National Day, songs are strong. National Day every year, everyone is happy, sing together! National humiliation every year, has increased without stopping, danger is near. Get up! Get up! Get up! Compatriots,</p>

<p>Zhou Boxun is going to Xi'an to open a movie theater. This news, which was first revealed by this newspaper, has now become more concrete.</p>
<p>Some say that Boxun wants to go to Xi'an to open a movie theater in order to leave a chess piece, because Bao Ke's "Pin" was opposed by the company's colleagues and went out, but his close friends Yuan Muzhi and Zhao Bangyu are still there to find opportunities for him.</p>
<p>Kaimaila asked, "How is Miss Tan Ying doing recently? Very concerned!"</p>
<p>It is heard that Lianhua's masterpiece "Heavenly Ethics" will be screened after the stars' "Night Fragrance" and "Boatman's Girl". The reason is that silent films cannot compete with sound films, and "Night Fragrance" is the so-called first sound after Hu Die returned to China.</p>
<p>The "Movie Circle" charity entertainment party invited the "Movie Circle" to a tea party in Dashu. It was originally intended to ask the female stars to do "good deeds" in person, so that the female stars would be "embarrassed in person" and have to agree. After agreeing, they would naturally say a word and it would not be a problem.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the female stars were also well-behaved. They almost unanimously ignored it. Therefore, the enthusiastic philanthropists had to go away empty-handed.</p>
<p>After going away empty-handed, the so-called "star dance accompaniment" "good deeds" are probably cancelled invisibly.</p>
<p>I don't know how much the tea party in Dashu cost? (Indirectly, that is, how many disaster victims were killed) It is so memorable!</p>

<p>Amid the high calls for Chinese people to develop the border areas, the Moon Bright Company's photography team in Tibet actually shot more than 50,000 feet of film back. It has now been sorted out and is ready to add interior scenes for public screening. In terms of scripts, two were strictly selected: one named "Five Ethnicities Live Long" and the other named "Republic Live Long". They have been sent to Beijing for preliminary review and passed, and are now working on dividing the scenes for review.

<p>— Zhenmin</p>
<p>In recent years, various gasoline engines in various countries have developed extremely rapidly. The rate of increase in gasoline consumption has accelerated. It really has a trend beyond everything. According to the results of geological surveys over the years. The world's reserves of kerosene are gradually depleting. This statistic. Of course, it gives a major blow to the future of gasoline cars. Engineers around the world have been working hard in recent years to study new fuel problems for automobiles. Alcohol, charcoal, artificial kerosene, etc. have been successfully tested. But using this fuel to power cars. There are always various difficulties and obstacles. For example, when using charcoal as fuel. It is always difficult to avoid delays in time. Difficulties such as igniting and braking. Such as alcohol. It will also have the same disadvantage of braking difficulties. As for using artificial kerosene. The equipment cost during refining is too high. The economic problems of driving. It is very difficult to solve. In this difficult situation. Engineers have gradually shifted their gaze. Engage in fundamental exploration. And our automobile ancestor, the "steam car." Has once again been noticed by general engineers. Because this type of car has various advantages and conveniences. It is really unmatched by other vehicles. In recent years, there have been extraordinary achievements in the design improvements of this type of vehicle. In addition to this "steam car." There is also the diesel car, which is being enthusiastically researched by general engineers. Now, let's describe their recent progress and trends separately below.</p>
<p>(1) New Trends in Steam Cars The invention of the steam car. As early as 1878 (Western calendar). Earlier than any other car. The initial design was very simple. There was only a boiler and cylinder. And - all the switches. It wasn't until 1895 in the Western calendar. Fangcai had a more thorough plan. But the speed and all the equipment. Still has not been improved. This is really the pioneering period of steam cars. In the past five years, world engineers have made amazing achievements in improving steam cars. The steam engine used. It is a kind of most ingenious and latest type. The size of this engine is 4" × 5". It can be directly connected to the rear axle. Without using gears, etc. for transmission. Because there is a constant steam supply. Therefore, at any vehicle speed. Can have the highest capacity. There has also been very precise progress in the structure of the engine's valves. Steam input. Can be adjusted very finely. Boilers are all fire-tube type. Can have a pressure of more than 500 pounds. In the past. European and American - ordinary "gentlemen". I thought this mobile boiler. Are very dangerous. And opposed. In fact, this concept is a huge mistake. Because on 20th century boilers. Equipped with many safety designs. Even more on this boiler used in cars. Absolutely no danger will occur. The biggest advantage of steam cars. It is simple in construction and very convenient to brake. And when driving. There is absolutely no noise. The supply of fuel does not depend on kerosene. Only coal and water are sufficient. In terms of economy. Of course, it is much cheaper. At the same time, because of the simple mechanical structure. The manufacturing cost is very low. This all - all. Is something that gasoline cars cannot match. In recent years, there has been a rapid trend in the improvement of various components on the car. For example, the excellent use of electrical systems. The ingenious combustion furnace. High efficiency of the vacuum brake, etc. The extreme streamlining of the car body is no longer a problem. According to statistical results. Of the cars registered in the United States in 1933. 3.5% are steam cars. In 1934 it was 15%. This year to date. Steam cars account for 21.8%. This rapid rate of increase. It's really amazing. It is expected that future achievements. There is even more fierce progress.</p>
<p>(2) New Trends in Diesel Cars Because of the high price of gasoline. Diesel cars have gradually replaced gasoline cars in recent years. If the same car uses diesel as fuel. The cost per mile of driving can be reduced by 56%. So the development of diesel cars in recent years. Unusually rapid. The increase in engine compression. Make the efficiency particularly outstanding. Although the fuel for diesel cars comes from kerosene. But because it does not require refining. Once kerosene runs out. Can be extracted from coal. This is more convenient and economical than refining gasoline. In the American car races in the past two years. Diesel cars have made significant progress in increasing speed. The strong engine structure. Makes the compression particularly increased. And because of the ingenious fuel injector and braking mechanism. Makes braking unexpectedly convenient. The streamlining of the car body. Makes the car shape more aesthetically pleasing and reduces air pressure. According to statistical results. The life of a diesel engine. More durable than a gasoline engine. This is due to design and factual needs. In the current situation. The price of diesel engines. A little more expensive. But the average driving cost. But it is much cheaper. In the 1934 American cars. 30% are diesel engines. Germany already has more than 40%. The future trend. Perhaps all gasoline cars. Will be replaced by this diesel car.</p>

<h3 id="e228">This Year's Millionth Commemorative Car from Two Major Companies <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>General Motors' Chevrolet General Motors recently completed its millionth car of 1935. The completion period. It was 64 days earlier than last year's completion period. However, according to GM Vice President Knudson. The working procedures for 1936. It will be larger and faster than this year. Regarding sales. According to Sales Director Vice President Grande. The sales volume next year will also increase compared to this year. In short, the prospects for both production sides. They are all optimistic and upward. One year is better than one year. This year's millionth General Motors car. It is a Chevrolet's luxurious city sedan. At the beginning of August. It was completed and left the factory. Last year's millionth General Motors car. It was not released until October 10th. So this year's millionth completion period. It is more than two months faster than last year. This year's millionth car. Its number is among the Chevrolet cars that produce 5,600 vehicles per day. It ranks number 1,384. The engine number is 5, 4 Tai 2, 112. However, the production number. Does not include Obordon. The Bili Zhi freight cars manufactured in Germany. And the Bedford freight cars in the UK are included. Speaking of the market development in 1936. Knudson and Grande have the same opinion. That is, the current average selling price. It will still maintain the status quo next year. Reducing prices is unlikely to become a reality. Increasing the selling price is even more impossible. The reason for this is that the cost of labor and raw materials. Can maintain stability. And the decline in raw materials. Will not become possible. According to Knudson. General Motors, like other automobile manufacturing companies. Striving to increase and expand their factories. The money General Motors needs and is currently using for this work. It reaches 35,000,000 US dollars. It's really a great number.</p>
<p>Ford's V8 The 2 millionth V8 Ford – the millionth Ford completed in less than twelve months, and approximately the 23,000,000th Ford – was completed on July 13th of this year at the Ford Motor Company's Rouge plant. Ford's founder, Henry Ford, and Ford Motor Company President Edsel Ford, both witnessed the final assembly of this historically valuable Ford. Once this two-millionth Ford left the factory. It began its 2,700-mile long journey. Straight to San Diego, California. There, this car. It will be displayed in the Ford display at the California Pacific International Exposition. Since June 19, 1934. Since the Ford factory completed the millionth Ford. Another million vehicles were completed in less than a year. This confirms what Ford said at the end of last year. That is, Ford Motor Company "will exceed one million units in 1935." This 2,000,000th V8 Ford. It is the fourth historically significant Ford to cross the continent. These four cars. Between the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. Have all worked on one of the four major highways to promote it. The earliest can be traced back to 1909. A T-style Ford. At that time, it was a newcomer in the automotive industry. And it was soon destined to become the most famous car. It marched from New York to Seattle. At the cross-continental car race that ended at the Alaska Yukon Pacific Exposition. Won the Guggenheim Medal. Ford personally congratulated the car that won the paddle at the finish line. The second historically significant Ford. Belongs to No. 10,000,000, also a T-type. Completed in 1924 after leaving the Highland Park factory. Then from New York, it went straight to San Francisco via the Lincoln Highway. The third historically valuable one. It is an A-type car. Belongs to No. 20,000,000. Completed in 1931 at the Rouge plant. After arriving in New York. Then from there to Los Angeles and San Francisco. The fourth historical record Ford. It is the 1,000,000th V8 Ford. Completed on June 19 last year at the Rouge plant, it was driven to Chicago and then displayed in the Ford display at the Century of Progress Exposition.</p>
<h3 id="e229">Overview of the Guangxi Provincial Highway <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Yong</p>
<p>Guangxi's highways began in the 7th year of the Republic of China. At that time, the Yongwu Road, which was 120 li long. First start construction. The Longnan Road, which is 90 li long, followed. After the 10th year of the Republic of China. Yongbin and Wubo roads both identified sorting out traffic as the basis for improving all government affairs. Therefore, highways in Yongliu, Guiwu, Zhentian and other regions were built one after another. After several years of generous management. Thousands of miles of highways were built in the overlapping mountains. In the past, the rugged and obstructed. To this end, the main roads in various districts have been opened one after another. Not only have culture and economy developed considerably. The implementation of politics. The progress of military affairs. Also receive good results. However, land transportation. Railways must be the main trunk. Connected with provincial, county and township roads. Make the veins communicate. And the effect is grand. In the past, due to time and economic relations. Railways have not yet started construction. County and township roads. Also failed to be held at the same time. In the 18th and 19th years of the Republic of China. Also because of social unrest. Everything came to a standstill. After the 20th year of the Republic of China, the provincial government reported stability again. The government is working hard to govern. Everything construction. Nothing is extremely sharp. In terms of road administration. The provincial roads that need to be urgently added, such as Baiping. Danchi. Yongqin. Cheda. Wuben. Each line. It has now been completed one after another. Mianliu Yong. Baidu. Limeng. Various lines. Are also being planned for construction. The rest of the county and township roads have also been revised and planned. Now either it has been completed. Or actively carry out. As for the railway. Line survey work has also been carried out. And plan construction. This is roughly the past and present situation of Guangxi's road administration. Now I will describe the general outline of the completed highways in this province. And future construction plans. In order,</p>
<p>(1) Guangxi Highway that has been completed Prior to the 20th year of the Republic of China, the districts of Nanning, Zhennan, Liujiang, Guilin, Cangwu, and Tiannan were established and managed separately. Since the unification of road administration a year ago, in addition to the road affairs of Yongzhen District being directly handled by the Highway Administration, each of the other districts of Gui, Liu, Wu, and Tian has an office. Everything is buried nearby. Now the province's highways have been completed. Nanning District 3,338 li. Zhennan District 1,537 li. Liujiang District 2,720 li. Guilin District 2,294 li. Cangwu District 1,755 li. Tiannan District 691 li. The total number of highways completed in the province is 12,341 li. Among them, provincial roads are 6,443 li. County roads are 5,898 li. If you enter Guangxi from Hong Kong and Guangdong and transfer to Annam. You can take a car from Rongxu to Longzhou in two days. You can enter Vietnam in three days. If you transfer to Guizhou, you can reach Qingyuan or Hechi in two days. You can enter Qian in three days. If you transfer to Hunan. You can reach Liuzhou or Lipu in two days. You can reach Guilin or Quanzhou in three days. You can enter Xiang in four days. For example, Annam enters Guangxi. Pass through Nanning and transfer to Xiangqian. You can take a car from Longzhou. Reach Liuzhou or Qingyuan in two days. Reach Guilin or Qianbian in three days. In the past four days. There is really a world of difference. The main lines of the completed highways in each district are listed below. And county roads are listed separately below.</p>
