<p>時評</p>
<h3>英法談判之展望　英</h3>
<p>自法意恊定於羅馬以來。識者早料歐洲大局之開展。必有如出岫春雲。波瀾重疊这勢。果出薩爾問題。繼羅馬恊定而告解决矣。操歐洲政局重心之英法當局。於日内瓦紛紛個别交換意見而後。又定於月杪在倫敦舉行兩國談判。行見佛蘭亭與賴伐爾之渡海而西。將無非商榷歐洲各主要問題。以謀歐局進一步之開展。路透社十九日倫敦電所稱歐洲懸案之會商將由是開端者。誠扼要之言也。</p>
<p>夫以今日歐洲局勢之動盪。最足引起英人之惶惑者。非卽此舉世所知德國欲解放凡爾賽和約束縛之一事乎。今茲所謂歐洲各主要問題云云。殆不外爲如何能使德國於法德恊調之下。獲得相當優勢之原則。此一目的而能達到者。一以紓法德關係之惡化。一以揚德國東進之旗。英爲歐陸外交計。固亦有失爲萬全之策也。倘非爲是。則何以羅馬恊定之墨瀋未乾。而小恊約與巴爾幹諸集團。已竊竊爲之疑懼。又何以倫敦之談判未啟。而米美爾問題。已復轉移爲德國視綫之中心歟。凡此皆足以證英國外交之成功。更觀乎賴伐爾未抵倫敦之先。卽十分重視東歐公約之前途者。已可見其盤馬彎弓之姿勢矣。</p>
<p>吾人嘗論德國今日外交政策之中心。其最高原則。本不外爲由凡爾賽和約之廢除。以取得軍事政治束縛之解放。惟自法國於年來積極構築對德大包圍陣綫以來。德國處境。是益艱難不得已而修好波蘭。屈服於意大利。近更對於薩爾區域非武裝之認可皆有苦衷存焉。其所委曲以求達最後之目的。卽在於凡爾賽和約之擺脫。故知今後法德關係之轉變。有賴於英人牽引之力不少。和平發展之機。亦全視將來英法談判之何如耳。</p>
<p>大抵今日歐洲問題。東歐與中歐各國之安全。實有絶大之關係。故自羅馬恊定而後。小恊約雖已被認爲須加入於保奧獨立之恊定。然小恊約爲不爲法國之犧牲工具起見。已表示非德波加入東歐互助公約。則法國必須向俄國訂立合作條約。此中歐與東南歐團結之表示。不啻對法國於赴英之前。先下一警告也。更卽李維諾夫於本月十九日重提去年十二月五日俄法雙方對外不締結恊定之聲明觀之。又知法國此次赴英之目的。將不惟涉及小恊約與巴爾幹諸國之地位。或更將影響於東歐各國如立陶宛。國際地位之前途。質言之。卽德國賴英之調解而趨於妥恊者。非有所取償於外不爲功歐洲問題。關係複雜。牽動特多。卽此一問題。究能使德國滿足至何程度。在法國允許於東歐公約進行期間不締結任何恊定之條件下。將何以答覆英國。此亦最堪注目之一事也。</p>
<h3>美國銀産大减</h3>
<p>將繼續向國外收買</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　據商部今日公佈之統計、美國銀産日見减少、所稱一旦通過命令式購銀計劃後、美國將被迫向國外市塲購買充份白銀貨幣之說、似已證實、商部公佈之統計如下、一九三四年六月至十一月之時期内、美國銀産大减、六月份國内出鑛之銀共二·三　一二·○○○盎斯、購銀政策卽於該月起實行、十一月份美國出銀僅有一·九七六·○○○盎斯、同時六月份世界出銀一四·八七一·○○○盎斯、十一月份則增至一五·三○八·○○○盎斯、（二十日國民電）</p>
<h3>美參加世界法庭可望通過參院</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）　參院中之政府方面發言人今日預料、美國參加世界法庭問題、如付表决、參院卽能通過、參議員波拉及約翰遜輩雖竭力反對、而政府派仍稱决能通過、惟政府爲避免將來受人指摘强迫參院通過此種重要國際議案起見、已决令反對方面月充分發表意見之機會、茲悉參院領袖擬將辯論時間無期延長、大槪彼等已如總統在其特别咨文中所表示、確有通過把握、故不欲操之過急、且此際各委員會適須討論政府所提及其他重要法案、議場中未免冷落、故世界法庭案之辯論亦未始非消磨時間之良機也（廿日國民）</p>

<p>（東京）　政友會今日開黨大會、决議宣言如下、現内閣組閣以來已半載、然因其無視政黨之外内政策、虚倡舉國一致、致曾未見有何政績、如現内閣、有意爲國施政、須聽從政黨之政策、際此國步艱難之際、政府無能、實堪使人爲國担憂、吾人此後尙欲以嚴正態度、監視政府、以期盡黨人之責云、又鈴木總裁、亦在今日大會演說謂、政府之責在求國家之安泰及産業之隆盛、然現内閣對此二項、未經保持其和平衡、忽視産業之發達、故吾黨於臨時議會、要求政府提出補充預算、並要求其切實救濟受災農工商民、然政府迄未施行具體政策、而政府祗知高倡舉國一致、担負難局、但不知何以實現質的舉國一致、而無視政黨、此因現内閣爲官僚内閣故也云云、（廿一日華聯社電）</p>
<p>（東京）　今日下午二時、政友會在本部開定期大會、鈴木總裁以下院内外總務各顧問幹事兩院議員等五百名出席、報告會務通過宣言决議及選舉常議員後、繼之以若宫幹事長與鈴木總裁之演說、至三時半散會、四時出席鈴木總裁在三綠亭之邀宴、又若宫幹事長之演說要旨如下、</p>
<p>與國民乖離之官僚、不認識國民之實况、故暢達民意、惟有求諸代表國民之政黨、而烏合之衆則難獲舉國一致之實效、官僚蔑視政黨、因維持政權而號稱舉國一致、實民意暢達之大妨碍、絶對多數之政友會以民意爲基礎、一致結束任事、誰能阻繞之乎、期以誠意爲基調、發揮黨之威力、重返憲政常道、用副國民之期待而努力之云、</p>

<h3>巴爾幹協約國參加法意議定書</h3>
<p>並望考慮補充協定</p>
<p>以解决中南歐問題</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　巴爾幹恊約國今日發表公報、宣佈决定參加最近羅馬成立之意法恊定、並稱巴爾幹各國承認羅馬恊定之原則大有利於國際關係云、查意相墨索里尼與法外長賴伐爾討論恊定之時、原注意小恊約國之加入、蓋如此卽可團結一百五十萬人之武力、以實行簽約國之决議、茲得巴爾幹各國之參加、實爲歐洲和平現實的迭克推多制代替軍縮政策之更進一步云、（二十日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　巴爾幹恊約中之希臘·土耳其·羅馬尼亞·南斯拉夫四國代表在此間舉行會議後、發表公報如下、「巴爾斡恊約四國代表經討論四國直接有關各項問題後、當卽就一般國際形勢、如最近法意談判成立羅馬恊定所産生之國際形勢、進行交換意見、巴爾幹恊約四國獲得同意、承認此項措置至關重要、羅馬恊定所規定各項原則極屬有益、巴爾幹恊約四國對於此種爲組織和平而進行之企國、不勝欣悅、希望此種措置、能顧及與鞏固中歐及東歐和平有關各國之地位、以期完備、而收實效、巴爾幹恊約四國代表茲再一致聲明、對於當前各項問題意見完全相同、該四國政府在過去業經共同行動、而獲和圓滿結果、嗣後更具堅强意志、繼續共同行動、以謀解决當前各項問題云」、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>法外長之談話</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）　法外長賴伐爾昨與蘇俄政府機關報伊土佛斯蒂亞報駐日内瓦記者談話、稱無論何物均不能使法國放棄其建立一切國家之保障以完成普遍之恊和之目的云、賴伐爾並謂、法國之政策極爲清晰、關係重大、且係不求私利而爲和平效勞云、法外長復稱、歐洲東北恊定已因蘇俄加入國聯之决策而更接近於解决之一日、且李維諾夫氏與彼本人已在日内瓦訂立正式恊定、雙方對於促成此約俱已表示决心、賴氏又稱、今日世界已到一時期、凡一國仍心懷侵略之志者、不久將自學其與舉世贊助和平之人羣相拂逆、此種觀念彼與意首相墨索里尼在羅馬談判時、亦已成立完全之諒解、故日後由東北恊定之成就至何種程度、卽可測知此項觀念之完全實現之是否可能也、賴氏末復指明普遍保障實利賴於大衆合作之志願、故卽在已經草成之諸恊約之外、任何國家苟能提出建議、確能增進共同之保障者、法國亦將竭其全力以贊助之云、（二十日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　法外長賴伐爾向伊斯維斯太報記者發表談話、其言曰、「法國政府之政策明顯而合適、且决不變動、當此薩爾問題已得最後解决、歐局發展已入一重要階段之際、予須將上述一點向國際聯盟聲明、蓋法國之政策旣屬和平、且不偏頗、其目的在謀各國之安全、保障一般之保安、此項政策堅决不變、和平之呼籲日益加甚、在此適當時期、此類呼籲、應令變爲事實、目下建議已經草就、如經通過、則蓄意破壞和平者將無路可走、接到此類建議之各國政府對此應負責任、去年有一偉大國家加入國聯、該國對於謀取和平之合作已具體表現其願望、蘇聯政府此項决議、遂令東方公約之議成爲可能、此約各點業經有關各國研究數月、目下吾人已能聲明、任何國家如欲侵略他國、必遭服膺和平之國家聯合反對、李維諾夫與予已用正式文件、表示此項力、</p>
<p>謀完成之决定、吾人卽令失望、亦將繼續努力、以有效之方法、增進和平之保障、此點予所深信不疑者也、蓋和平之爲物、實爲忍耐、勇敢與意志、李維諾夫曾曰、和平者不可分割者也、此語對於吾人之觀念實爲最佳之說明、吾人將賴東方公約之實現與否、診斷此等觀點實現之可能、此種觀點、予與莫索里尼已得完全同意、普遍之安全須賴普遍的和平意願以完成、目下部份之成效亦能消除憂慮之因素、此種因素實無人能保障其自身必能避免也、唯除此項計劃（去年開始研究、今年吾人須予以實現）以外、如有其他計劃能增進歐洲其他部份之安全者、則法國政府必能充分贊助」云、（二十日塔斯電）</p>
<h3>羅外長之談話</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）　羅馬尼亞外長迪杜萊斯哥向此間伊斯維斯太報記者發表談話云、「予以蘇羅復交爲吾政治生涯中最重要事件之一、不僅地理與歷史關係要求吾兩國之親切友誼、同時予以蘇羅而國領袖關於締建和平之思想極爲接近、故兩國遂能在國際生活中携手並進、李維諾夫之人格、遠在兩國復交之前、已爲吾人推崇、彼對國際合作之共獻最足珍貴、至於侵略國定義、如經各國接受、則戰爭自更難於爆發、因此項定義得令宣戰者擔負不能否認之責任也、羅馬尼亞對於目下歐洲各地進行之談判、至爲關心、羅國在地理上之地位已能說明、羅馬尼亞爲何希望締結東方公約之談判能早日完成、吾人視羅馬恊定爲多腦河流域合作之基礎、羅馬尼亞於考慮若干小恊約國及巴爾幹協約國所負義務之餘、將以歲分誠意參加此項恊定、吾國外交政策之基點乃在小恊約國與巴爾幹恊約國、以及吾國與法國之聯盟、而蘇羅及法蘇友誼乃能令此等聯盟發生正常作用、上述聯盟目的絶非攻擊他人、反之、此等聯盟實爲東歐和平最高的保障、由此可知、予於蘇羅邦交之發展估計甚高、因予深知蘇聯視其與法國之邦交爲何等重要」云、（二十日塔斯電）</p>
<h3>法報之樂觀</h3>
<p>（巴黎）　法外長賴伐爾在日内瓦交涉之結果、巴黎迴聲報之政治記者波丁那氏現已放棄其悲觀之態度、加入於一片頌讚之聲、波氏於星期日迴聲報中稱、賴氏此次在日内瓦之行動、係法國外交政策之一轉機、且已回復至不應離棄之當軌云、並據各報今日之記載、賴氏已通知波蘭外長貝克謂如波蘭堅持不參加東歐公約、則法國將與蘇聯及捷克訂立單獨恊定、而置波蘭於事外云、據云、賴氏之語氣頗爲鄭重、波蘭政府當局聞之頗爲震動、因法國若與俄捷訂約、則波蘭將處於完全孤立之地位、不惟法波同盟爲之動搖、卽波蘭羅馬尼亞同盟亦將受其影響也、巴黎新聞報則稱、統觀日内瓦近日所進行之交涉、雖不能謂國聯及其他數國之行動係由畏懼德國使然、但德國確已使齊集日内瓦之諸國心懷疑慮、故德國之重返彼等之儔伍、實有得不愼重將事云、（二十日國民電）</p>
<h3>俄報之評論</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）　伊斯維斯太報載一題名「爲和平而奮鬥之聯合戰綫」之論文、聲稱李維諾夫、賴伐爾及迪杜萊斯哥之談話、均能表現蘇聯、法國、小恊約國及巴爾幹恊約國共同决定、願繼續其聯合戰綫、爲一般和平特别爲東歐和平而奮鬥、同時令東方區間公約得以實現、此等談話發表於羅馬恊定及薩爾公民投票結束之後、故在政治上有極大之意義、世間一部份報紙謂羅馬恊定爲西歐四大强國願爲西歐（只爲西歐）安定和平之恊定政策之開端、歐洲一部份資産階級對於薩爾公民投票之結果至爲歡迎、視此爲法德和平邦交袪除一種障礙、同時能增進西歐各國對於德國帝國主義擴張計劃之懇摯、</p>
<p>此種解釋之目的在令爲世界和平而奮鬥之陣綫、破壞而削弱、惟李賴迪三氏之聲明已令此類解釋粉碎、西歐和平雖經鞏固、而東歐和平並未增强、則其結果、必爲戰爭傾向之導向東歐、唯東歐如有戰事、必將牽及西歐爲可患耳、</p>
<p>賴伐爾之聲明可稱一重要之文件、彼表示其本人及其政府、均願爲締結東方公約、而堅决奮鬥、且視此項計劃爲其他各國和平傾向之試金石、迪杜萊斯哥與捷克外長貝奈斯、土外長羅舒第對於東歐及南歐和平之增進有極大供獻、迪氏以全力聲稱、彼與蘇法和平政策完全一致、迪氏之言初非限於迪氏個人之意見、要知捷克、南斯拉夫、土耳其及希臘各國均與迪氏同意焉、故賴伐爾氏代表法國之聲明、已得小恊約國及巴爾幹恊約國之充分贊助、</p>
<p>李維諾夫確能堅信、關心歐洲各國國民和平組織與和平保障之列國、不僅將繼續合作、此種合作將以更大之力量、速度與意識以實現之、李氏坦然謂德國曰、東歐公約之成否、唯德國是賴、而其實現機會確已大增矣、正以蘇聯外交所取步驟與建議有益於世界和平、同時亦爲德國國民所歡迎、故李氏能向德國作如此公開之聲明、</p>
<p>該報復稱、小恊約國及巴爾幹恊約國代表常言李維諾夫於實施蘇聯政府政策之際、其尊重與信實實令彼等感動、李維諾夫自謂、彼離日内瓦時、對於彼討論鞏固歐洲和平必要步驟之政治家、益能堅信云云、伊斯維斯太報遂稱此種互信之基礎乃爲和平而共同奮鬥、凖備侵略之政策乃欲破壞各國之信心、且從而離間之、和平政策則反是、各國政治及社會意見雖不相同、唯此項政策則欲令其團結、相互信任、參加和平聯合戰綫之各國、共爲安全而奮鬥之用力愈大、則各國代表之互信愈堅、</p>
<p>唯努力和平不能僅賴政治家之努力、且欲令各國國民日益親善、國民大衆能經常予以援助焉、大衆不信說話、而信事實、吾人深望凡關心於維持並增進和平之國家、其外交行動確能附合其關於信任之言辭焉、此等聲明均爲日内瓦談判之結果、其於保全整個歐洲和平之希望、必能加强、且必爲蘇聯與論所滿意云、（二十一日塔斯電）</p>
<h3>奧國復辟聲</h3>
<p>副總理公開宣言</p>
<p>惟帝制派尙否認</p>
<p>維也納奧國復辟運動已更進一步、蓋副總理兼内衛軍總司令史泰亭堡親王向内衛軍各隊長訓辭、謂彼覺帝制實爲奧國所必需、亦爲歐洲和平之樞紐云、查史氏對於帝制運動之態度向屬曖昧、現陧</p>
<p>在正式承認、誠可視爲復辟之極大進步、惟史氏仍警告帝制派勿操之過急、並稱、沃都大公何時卽位、應由内衛軍决定云、據消息靈通之觀察者之意、奧國復辟之後、歐洲局勢將大爲變動、因各國對此意見紛歧、反對者有小恊約國、而以南斯拉夫及捷克爲尤甚、法國聞將不致反對、因復辟之後、德奧合併一事當可無庸過慮、以奧國本身而論、祇須如何避免觸怒南斯拉夫捷克兩國、其他卽無問題、另一辦法則爲漸進主義、先由沃都大公出任元首以爲過渡、惟不用總統或攝政名義、然後再宣佈帝制、而卽帝位云、（二十日國民電）</p>
<p>維也納奧皇室復位運動之直接原因、衆信爲薩爾公民投票中之德國大勝利、聞官塲對於薩爾之歸德、頗形恐慌、故擬造成復辟、以抵制國社黨之挑戰、維也納各處夜間發佈傳單、其形式類似社會黨與國社黨所需用者、作推舉大公爲下屆總統之運動、不過其所擬推選者、爲沃都大公、而非歐琴大公耳、（二十日路透電）</p>
<p>維也納帝制派代表韋斯納曙爵否認選舉歐琴大公爲下屆奧總統之說、指爲純粹讕言、且謂造此奧皇室復辟謠言者、爲駐奧德使巴本、蓋欲揑造謠言、以示奧國爲歐洲和平危害也云、但奧副總理史泰漢堡對内衛軍下級軍官二千人演說、謂哈浦斯堡皇室之復辟、可致中歐於和平、又謂此問題成熟時、解决之者爲内衛軍、而非立法會云、（二十一日路透電）</p>

<h3>證劵</h3>
<p>紐約合盛洋行二十一日報告、證券開盤前、有利於市况之因素、爲鋼業報稱、上週銅廠工作、約占其生産力百分之五十一、比前週增百分之五·六、而揚司頓區域之鋼廠工作、本週約及百分之六十四、此爲鋼鐵需求擴大之徵、而不利於市况之因素、則爲證券市塲缺少領導力、在金條文案未判决時、仍有觀望猶預之象、今晨證券開盤、市况堅穏、但所漲僅限於零數、</p>
<p>又據路透社報告、今晨垣街之注意點、集中於金條文問題假定的判决之可能性、此案刻猶在最高法院之討論中、操業者因此不無觀望、交易因以滯頓、鋼業消息確可歡迎、但說者以爲鐵路與營造業苟不即爲鋼鐵之消費者、則其向上之趨勢、終必大受頓挫、鋼業股票現已起色、美國鋼鐵優先股、今晨開盤漲起一磅音、一般工商消息、依然良好、但人氣雖已轉佳、交易未必即增、蓋至少須俟諸金條文問題之有解决也、茲將紐約證券市價列左、</p>

<p>—黑熱病被人忽視之五現象—</p>
<p>清江浦通信、蘇北黑熱病之發生、及病區分布與患者統計、前函報告已詳、茲再將病象病理及診治情形、續誌如次、</p>
<p>現象黑熱病潛伏期不爲甚短、確期難定、病象初現時、全身發寒熱、有如瘧疾、但循環期並不規則、約十日後、寒熱自愈、此時脾已變硬、但爲塊尙小、不易察覺、半月或數月後、又發寒熱、同時脾塊增大、可以摸到、相繼發生之現象、則爲腹疼·消瘦·貧血·四肢發腫·出盜汗·牙齦變胚·劓血·飲食减少·肚瀉·便血·喉疼·精神萎下鄉調查之黑熱病研究隊</p>
<p>靡·夜盲·性欲頓减·月經停止不孕·患者病勢日重、終則死於副發病、如肺炎走馬疳（Noma）衰竭（Exhauegion）速則六個月即死、遲則三年必死、三年以上不死者、則殊少見、民國二十三年夏、遠東熱帶病學會在南京開會時、蒲南谷博士曾指出黑熱病之被人忽視之五種現象、一、腹疼、二、夜盲、三、月經停止、四、不孕、性慾减</p>
<p>退、各國出席代表皆甚注意、</p>
<p>診治此間診治、每逢星期一三五上午八時至十二時門診、病人多時恒至一百二十餘人、除雨天亦有六十餘人、病人先在掛號室掛號、如係新病人、則須至門診檢騐室檢騐血液及大小便、而後診察注射、診察由醫務主任蒲南谷負責、檢騐及昆蟲研究、由技佐吳徵鑑蔡長霖、及技術生張駿顥担任、注射則由護士担任、茲分述於下、（甲）檢騐、大小便檢騐、一如平常、不贅述、新病人抽去血液約四或五立方糎、檢騐六點、一、由血球計數、每單位内白血球正常爲七千至八千、</p>
<p>黑熱病患者有少至六百者、因黑熱原蟲L·D·body在白血球内繁殖一次、即破壞白血球無數、故黑熱病患者白血球特少、二、血色素測騐、健康人血色素、恒爲標準血色素百分之八十以上、黑熱病患者之血色素、有低至百分之十者、三、球蛋白沈澱試騐、若有沈澱、即表示有黑熱病、四、蟻酫試騐、若成固體、即表示有黑熱病、五、銻質試騐、以銻質一成、加入血清九成中、若成樹枝形、即表示有黑熱病、六、血片檢查、看有無黑熱病原蟲及瘧疾原蟲、黑熱病患者打針期滿後、仍行血液檢騐、看有無未盡黑熱病原蟲L·D·body存在、住隊患者、則另加兩種檢騐、一、紅血球計數、一如平常、二、出血率、（Bleeding　Tima（以針刺耳、若其流血時間在五分鐘以内、則斷定可行脾肝穿刺（Splenio　or　l'iver　puncture）穿刺所得液汁、用供研究檢騐詳見第六節（乙）診察、先問環境關係、及得病經過、而後按摸脾肝、如黑熱病患者、另有其他病症、亦加以診察、給以藥品、最後則决定當日應行之注射量、並且每來一新病人、即在地圖之某一點上插一黑夾針、積二黑夾針則換一綠爽針、綠夾針代表二人、藍夾針代表三人、黃夾針代表四人、紅夾針代表五人、紅夾針最多之處、亦卽治病人最多之村莊、（丙）注射、清江浦本地醫生、恒用Neosuiboan及Neostan二種注射劑、清江浦西藥房近來每年銷數達七知管以上、鄉間醫師則常用TartarEmetio注射劑、三種注射劑中、以Neottiboson爲最有效而無毒、黑熱病研究隊即採用Neotib研究隊作儿肝穿刺情形</p>

<p>汽油售價、自英·美·俄·三國火油公司、締結分銷辦法後、即漸趨一致、由每十加侖售洋五元二角、逐步漲至九元一角、但離成本尙遠、故擬於下月起、再行提高價格、茲誌各情如下、</p>
<h3>公司年虧約百萬元</h3>
<p>昨據煤油業中人語大公社記者、目下汽油價格、雖漲達九元一角、但相去其成本尙遠、按各公司歷年之營業觀察、汽油每十加侖須售洋十二元以上、始能有利可圖、故現下每脫售十加侖、須虧達三元左右、逐年損失、各公司當在百萬元以上、差幸在華之油公司、均係國際性質、可以截長補短、於總公司結賬後、尙有餘利可得、</p>
<h3>下月起將再度漲價</h3>
<p>在華之美孚·德士古·油遍地·亞細亞·等四大油公司、有鑒於斯、曾於本月間恊商數次、討論提高售價、具體辦法、當即擬定於下月起、一致提高、不得故意將售價漲落、其高漲標準、是否於舊價上加增一二元、或另訂新價、尙須再經一度磋商、方可决定、</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第八回　僻地輕官遠來强項令華　盛宴外有可憐蟲</p>
<p>因笑道，像程先生在西安這樣交遊廣闊，上自主席，下至各位廳長局長没有一個不認識的，何不在本省找一個位置，這比在教育界要清閑的多了。程志前笑道：那也是各人的興趣不同。兄弟爲人，頗不合於作官。再說，我們無所求於人的時候，主席也好，廳長局長也好那都是朋友，等到你去求人，就不是朋友了。張介夫默然，微笑了一笑，因道：聽說此地建設廳高廳長和程先生至好。志前道：也是到西安來才認識的。張介夫笑道：他很應酬程先生呵！志前算明白了，必定是高鶴峰請客的事，他也知道了，便笑道：是的，明天又要叨擾他一餐飯。不過那是作陪客，他並非專門請我。張介夫心裏有一句話要說，可又不好猛然的說了出來，只管出神，眼望了桌上發呆。在他視綫下，却發現了一張字條，那字條上寫的是朱月英十七歲，原籍湖南衡州，居甘肅業已三代。今逃命來西安，欲賣身爲人作妾，上有寡母及祖母，均寄居舅氏家，終日不得一飽。就是這樣一段文字，上下都没有套語，不像履歷，也不像是信件。程志前知道他是在注意看着，便笑道：張先生看了這字條，有些不懂所以吧。張介夫本不是注意這張字條，但是人家問了，只好笑答道對了，這女孩子的相貌長的也還不錯。像程先生這樣有身分的人，在這裏新娶一位如夫人，這很算不得什麽？何不出幾個錢，把他救出苦海？程志前笑道：若是我有那種豪興的話，我也不必到西安來納妾，在上海·在北平·這樣的機會，恐怕是多得不可勝數。（一一八）</p>
<h3>油條小語</h3>
<p>— 王莎葩</p>
<p>油條，誰都知道是平民的食品!我每次看大餅店裏的伙計，把碱水發好的麵粉，搓成小小的兩條，再把兩條拼在一起，攪了幾攪，送入沸油的鍋裏，它便會立刻漲發開來，短的變長了，細的變粗了，實的也變空了，怪有趣的。</p>
<p>據說：這油條是起始在宋朝岳武穆時代，緣因是岳飛給秦檜用詭計害死了。當時的百姓，對於岳飛的忠良，是十分愛戴的，他們深深痛恨秦檜的不良，所以後來。在秦檜死了以後，百姓們都把麵粉製成的人體，當作秦檜的屍身，放入沸油裏去煎，作爲奸臣下塲，忠良不朽的紀念，所以也有呌作油炸檜的，就是說油炸秦檜的意思，雖然是無稽之談，但倒也很近情理。</p>
<p>昨天，偶然在收音機中，聽到某滑稽家唱什麽大餅油條歌：「大餅油條，大餅油條，吹麥花！吹麥花！三只銅板買一只，三只銅板買一只，快去買。快去買。」眞是别開生面？</p>
<p>油條在熱的時候，確是香嫩可口，冷了就没有味了。不過冷的也有法子吃的，把油條摘斷，放入碗裏，加醬油味精少許，用開水一冲，那又是很好吃的了。</p>
<h3>兩兄弟</h3>
<p>— 吳雅开</p>
<p>「夜報，要看到剛剛出版的夜報！」這啞嘶的聲音，只要在夕陽西斜的時候，便在街頭出現了。每天每天，這聲音在我耳邊也要掠過有知幾千百次。</p>
<p>—那是生之呌喊呵！是生活的呼號呵！我這樣的憧憬着。</p>
<p>這是兩個賣夜報的孩子，一個十三歲，一個十一歲，他們是兩兄弟，我看的夜報，便是由他們送來的；所以每天總要和他們搭訕幾句，這幾乎成了我的習慣，於是從他們口裏得知了他們的生活情形。</p>
<p>他們家裏是高郵，自從前年給大水冲去了他們的家鄉以後，便同父母一起到了上海來。他父親是拉黃包車的，母親有時也去敲敲石子，他們一家都住在閘北，生活雖然很苦，但倒也過得去。可是事情偏是這樣的不幸，他們的父親就在一二八之役送掉了性命！他們雖同母親從險境裏逃了出來，起初被救進了難民收容所，到了停戰恊定以後，便又失却了依據。</p>
<p>一天二天三天，光陰是像閃電一般的在眼前飛過，他們的生活也總算在他們困苦掙扎中度過去了。北四川路橋堍的一段，便是他們兄弟俩奮鬥得來的生活地盤，所以一到夜快，這啞嘶的賣報聲便在這週遭洋溢着；當我一覺醒來，深夜十二點鐘的時候，還會常常聽到這種生活的呌喊！無論是晴天下雨，夏天或冬天，西北風裏或大雪中，他們從没一天間斷過。</p>
<p>他們没有受過教育，然而一條不輕不重的生活担子却已壓上了他們的肩頭，他們没有修得像一般孩子的福份，這麽大的年紀已經跳出了慈母的懷抱，走向人生的途上去了；於是這一條北四川路橋畔就印上了不少他們生活的血跡。</p>
<h3>牛步化</h3>
<h3>夜訪天寧寺（續）</h3>
<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>「是的，多喝了些酒，天眞冷得可以。」</p>
<p>「快寺裏去吧，那兒生着火缽子！」</p>
<p>於是我跟着和尙，就燈光跨進山門。那匹吠狗，也已柔馴地竄在我的面前，搖着尾巴。那四金剛的塑像有多麽大，當然辨不出來，就連頭門的輪廓也埋在黑染缸裏。</p>
<p>掌燈和尙的麻鞋，踏在空庭的落葉上，發出綷綷縩縩的聲韻。我故意落後五六步，要看那　動的紅燈，燈影裏的僧衣，和一匹忠誠的狗。喲！這簡直是一片靜到無可再靜的詩料！</p>
<p>等到月亮逃出雲堆，我們恰恰走上大雄寶殿東側的長廊。回頭　滿庭大樹，又這樣蓬勃地伸頭在如汞的月明中，一點聲響都没有，只飄零着一葉兩葉的殘葉。</p>
<p>全寺多環曲的走廊，廊裏盡亮着電燈，和尙把燈籠熄了，還是引我進友人的臥房去。走過經堂，香烟繚繞，鐘鼓齊鳴，有三個高僧，盤踞法壇上做着水陸道塲。旁邊三五十沙彌附和着，在深夜裏，聽來眞是動人！</p>
<p>略微住了脚，偷眼巡視一遍，再穿房入户的跟着走，不料我的友人正坐在一間客堂裏的蒲團上唸經，兩人相見，自然狂歡的了不得，幾乎忘記打發呌那個掌燈和尙回去。我一看到友人的豐腴的面貌，活潑的動作，以及健談的那些形態，不由得心中輕快起來。</p>
<p>這一晚，不用說誰都不曾想睡。談天說地，評酒論詩，直到了天明。看看火缽子裏燒殘的炭灰，高高地堆着，却不曾知道膍外已颺着雨絲，花圃裏滿是積水！（完）</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （憂忠生）</p>
<p>在玩具店裏，看見掛着許多各式不同的假面具。我的朋友對我說：這許多的假面具，可以代表世人的面目，這爿玩具店，就可表整個的世界了。我聽了他的話，覺得很幽默有味。</p>
<p>未定婚的人，拚命想追求異性。已訂婚的人，拚命想趕快的結婚。已結婚的人，拚命想脫離束縛。</p>
<p>拉雜話</p>
<h3>畫餘漫寫</h3>
<p>— 一葉</p>
<p>凡書畫裝璜之佳者自范　始，畫家之有專集問世，自沈石田始；李笠翁刻芥子圍畫傳大行於世，爲古今之第一習畫本。</p>
<p>金冬心常畫繁枝密蕊之梅花，是愛健全之美者，與作病梅館記之龔定菴，同具一種心目。</p>
<p>仇十洲爲明代第一流畫家，因出身自漆工，不懂題跋，故其畫極爲當時文人所輕視，王時敏爲清初畫宗，因學問不甚高，人認其作品爲乏書卷氣，便降富時的聲價；文人士大夫畫支配的當時社會，才會這奇怪的現象，結果只是殘害藝術。可憐純粹的繪畫便受了歧視，眞的藝術家就活生生地飛在乏書卷氣的磔刑上了。</p>
<p>「尺山寸樹人豆馬」。這怕是國畫有科學的比例法之始。</p>
<p>王洽先漣墨於圖幛，隨形而宣，張璪手握雙管，一時齊下，一爲生枝，一爲枯枝，同爲技巧上别尋出路。</p>
<p>日人大村西厓所著「中國美術史」一書，雖以朝代來劃分藝術思潮的遞嬗是其病處，但我們自已不來弄一本像樣的美術史，反來沾外人的光，這眞羞到無話可說。聽說此老的年紀很大，而研的精神却甚驚人，他在十年前聞說發見了楊惠之的作品，曾趕來蘇州角直鎭看過楊惠之雕塑的羅漢像，回國後出了一本「吳郡奇蹟塑壁殘影，」書前並做了洋洋萬餘言的考。大槪我們中國的藝術文獻不但靠外人供給，就藝術品也得靠外人來保存，考證。只要看故宫博物院院長，因偷古物被告發而逃走了事，和山西雲岡佛像因某師長要建别墅而破鑿毀之事就可知道。</p>
<p>張彦遠曾嘲過善詩而不懂畫的杜甫，不曉得韓幹的藝術眞價，使古今獨擅鞍馬之妙手的名作玄宗御廐之沛艾名馬，貽以畫肉之誚，若老杜有知，亦當點頭，記得前年一位什麽家自稱不懂藝術又要做藝術批評文章，曾引起若干大師畫宗們的廣告論戰，藝術批評云乎哉！</p>
<p>廚川白村說：「藝術的鑑賞，就和迷於女人完全一樣，對手和自已之間，在什麽地方，脾氣帖然相投。」我以爲不但鑑賞者對於藝術品這樣，就作者對於創作時的物象也要這樣，與對方的感情和生命引起熱烈的感應共鳴，才會有藝術家，才會有藝術批評家。</p>
<p>「六幅故牢建，知君筆意踪，不求千澗水，止要兩三松，樹下留盤石，天邊縱遠峰，近巖幽濕處，惟藉墨烟濃，」這是大愚和尙向荆浩乞畫的詩，他不但以詩當錢，在畫面上畫的什麽他都開列出來了，但藝術家不是商人，不能依單發貨，藝術有時也成爲商品，可是藝術家的頭腦根本不是機器。</p>
<p>商業藝術的起源，在於十八世紀末葉法國曾有畫家爲外科醫生畫過招牌。</p>
<p>Gictto幼年牧於山野，過了Cimabua才帶他回到畫室中習畫，後成爲文藝復興的先驅，翡冷翠畫派的始祖，宋朝蕭照，靖康中流入太行爲盜，一日掠至李唐，見其行篋中只是一些畫料，他便隨李南渡，紹興中得居畫院待詔之職，古代大畫家出身是這樣出奇，可是，他們若没有機緣藝術天才怕是無從發展的。</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>本來：這是候已到午飯的時候，我於是知道今天的一次午飯，將有異味嚐到了。但是我們卻並不真吃冷飯，太后又給我們解釋道；</p>
<p>「不過這究竟是一種儀式，我們的意思，只在追憶祖德；所以在好久以前，早就定下了一個變通的辦法，並不真用冷飯，而用旁的冷食來作為一種替代品」。</p>
<p>於是我們都忙着要瞧那食匣裏面究竟是裝的什麽東西。待打開來一瞧，原來是好幾碟已經洗净而不曾煮過的山東生菜，它們的葉子都很闊大，顔色又很白嫩，想來滋味是不會錯的！另外還有幾碟肉醬。太后第一個先自取起了一葉生菜，又吩咐張德把那肉醬端起來，讓伊自己揀了一些，放在菜上，用手指捲成了圓筒形的一捲，慢慢地咀嚼着。我們都已瞧得很眼紅了，待到伊説了一聲「你們也吃吧」，便急急動手，來不及的張口大嚼。啊！滋味真是好極了！生菜既肥嫩，而那肉醬中又因有鷄肉和鴿子肉和着的縁故，真比任何一種肉醬的滋味更鮮，加以我們從淸早起，忙忙碌碌的玩了這麽許久，又在新鮮的空氣中徜徉着，胃口不覺大開而特開，因此格外覺得這一餐冷食的滋味。真是不可形容的鮮美了！</p>
<p>這一天，總算和昨天玩狐仙塔一般的滿意而歸。在太后自己，像這樣有興味的假日，也是很少的；而對於我們，那是更屬難得，尤其是因為伊老人家一高興，臉上常堆着笑，我們也就覺得好過日子得多了！（二二八）</p>

<h3>東華勝東亞（甲甲）</h3>
<p>東華隊係滬江約翰兩校中之傑出人才組織成軍、且均是久戰沙塲宿將、以傳遞聯絡細膩稱長、垜截避敵諸般門楷、精而且滑、東亞戰士、殊少活動、故而抗衡之下、全局被東華控制、紀錄板上比較愈趨愈遠、東亞諸將處茲嚴密緊張局勢中、極難作爲、其間以和尙頭潘承斌最形勇敢、左右兩鋒雖亦不弱、無奈後衛太形軟弱、使與東華三鋒任意縱横、遂成不堪收拾之戰局、四十分鐘完畢、東華以五九對十五大勝、</p>

<h3>麥令勝眞茹（甲甲）</h3>
<p>最後一戰爲麥令對眞如、麥令憑洛克之勇猛無匹、前後策應全隊因而大形聯絡、眞如之籃頻爲所乘、戰士雖一再努力、無奈因現在大考期中、地板工夫、未免略爲生疏、致開始迄終、望塵莫及、上半時麥令以二十四對九高佔上風、後半時眞如健兒力謀收復失地、無如對方不加放鬆、遂成心餘力絀之戰局、結果以二十三對五一之比受挫而歸、</p>

<h3>西靑女子籃球兩江勝利雙收</h3>
<p>女子初試男子戰法</p>
<p>技術平平精彩不多</p>
<p>西靑女籃球會昨晚開幕、本屆因試用男子規則、故鼓勇參加者較少、而華隊之報名者僅兩江甲乙組、更難號召、較之往歲擁擠情形、不勝今昔之慨矣、兩江甲頗有奪標希望、惟在男子規則劇烈之衝刺下、其投籃尙須深切研究練習也、昨日該校雙喜臨門、結果如下、（一）兩江甲勝麥令（甲組）三十四比三、（二）兩江已勝漢豐禮（乙組）十一比七、</p>
<h3>甲隊大敗麥令</h3>
<p>麥令傑達利先行罰中、聲勢非凡、迨陳榮明罰得一球、彼又得一分、第一節兩江以一比二委曲求全、第二節兩江忽一躍爭先、榮明潘夢兩人連增至九比二、惟陳於斯時因四次犯規被罰出塲、上半時十四比二、第三節傑達利又罰得一分、然不幸蹈陳榮明之覆轍、該隊惟彼最凶而善戰、從此大勢去矣、兩江戰成念四比三、末節一面倒、結果兩江三十四比三大勝、</p>

<p>上塲時均不易得分、動作慌亂、笑科極多、第一節兩江蘇廷標罰中以一比○勝、上半時五比三、第三節局勢平均、戰至九比五、結果兩江十一比七勝、然其乙組之技術幼稚、遠不如阿姊（甲組）矣、</p>

<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、呈初定繼漲之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥漲三四角左右、坎拿大漲二三角左右、當開價時、本月份因交割又近、一部分之業外浮空、微有抵補、北路客帮、亦微有抽進、故市氣已見帶緊、遠期各月份、因廠抛不湧、各月份市情、遂亦略俏、迨至下午開盤、本月份因浮空仍有抵補、人心續見帶緊、二月份以接近本月份、人心亦佳、其餘月份、買户未見活動、小廠微月套賣、市氣穏固之中、遂亦帶疲也、結果本月份漲二厘半、二月份漲二分、三月份漲一分二厘半、四月份漲一分半、五月份漲一分七厘半、六月份漲七厘半、</p>
<h3>二月份期麥喊價高</h3>
<p>本月份因春節已提早停拍</p>
<p>昨日麥市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、呈先定後漲之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥漲三四角、坎拿大漲二三角左右、開價時以本月份已因春節提早停拍、二月份開價、初亦平平旋以洋麥已連好幾日、人心轉穏、又兼粉市回振、故各月份喊價、又漸高昂、迨至下午開盤、二月份市情、仍因出少進多、喊價甚穏、三月份以洋麥關係、漲度無幾、觀察前途、以交易祇有三天、恐少巨大之變化也、結果二月份漲六分、三月份漲一分、餘不動、現麥因廠冒未動、故無做開云、</p>

<h3>晚稻行情無甚榮辱</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨各帮來源共到在十餘號、（貨共六千餘石）銷塲本街平常、惟客路包胃頗参動動、有靑島帮辦一千五六百包、故晚稻形勢轉呈平平、行情無甚榮辱、僅宿次因缺乏問津、略修數分角許、各厚粳則以本胃見淡、市色較軟、續落角砠、杜洋尖及陰元絶貨無市、變元仍以去路不廣、繼呈軟勢、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨河下各埠到頭見稀、因莊家涇至野鷄墩轉斷、只到十三四號、市銷方面、白粳去胃仍然不暢、變元薄稻略化、洋尖呆滯、市價白粳高貨仍定、中次續疲近角、變元又小角外、薄稻及洋尖平疲之格、</p>
<h3>洋客秈晨挺午平</h3>
<p>昨日洋米市况、晨間本街胃口甚活、市面堅定、惟内地只辦　米七百色、其他槪不問訊、本街辦西貢一千五百包後、祇有回籠期貨二百噸交易、全市進出兩少、市面轉入平靜中、洋商抛售以議價未妥、致未成交、市形均居平順中、客秈上午以本街内地均活、市有步砌之象、但午後本客停頓、又以洋米亦無暢銷、市乃由昂轉平、全日開出各米二百七三十八包、多數爲本街辦去云、</p>
<h3>黃荳市價步高不已</h3>
<p>昨黃荳市况、續見猛漲、結果漲角外、以來源不多、去路蟬聯、且各産價提升、油餅市依然緊俏、又聞大連市劇砌、致貨户售意堅硬、昨日瀧海路等荳均緊扳未開、祇大連荳及漢口荳做開一萬餘包、計成交四平街荳十四五車、價自四元二角、開至四元二角半、由廠家辦去、本街採去范家屯荳三百餘包、價爲四元四角、内地及本街等去漢口乍荳三千六百餘包價自三元七角八至六角、　　荳一千三百包、價自三元七角至　角半、漢濤荳三百餘包、價爲四元一角及三元八角半、又沙市荳二百包、價爲三元五角六分、</p>
<h3>雨北貨</h3>
<p>白蓮步漲二三元</p>
<p>白蓮近因貨底軋缺、蘭谿地價步升至四十四元、故申市大爲活動、隨之緊漲、行盤已由四十五元升至四十六元、昨市叫至四十八元、同時湘蓮以存底尙厚仍呆、市勢依然平定、</p>
<h3>糖市</h3>
<p>粗砂白又跌角許</p>
<p>昨日糖市、趨勢依然疲軟、公會劃盤、二四粗砂白普通現貨叫十八元六角、未成碼頭交貨十八元六角七分、此跌角許、荷赤無成交、本廠綿白及太古糖均無變動、號盤有潮帶開出潮靑二百數十包、價爲十元半至九元八角、又海南赤數十包、十一元、比前週降去半元、建帮號家開出泉州片靑一百餘包、十元至九元八角、到貨有新疆怡生兩輪運來潮靑五千餘包、又枝洋二百○三包、</p>

<h3>油市</h3>
<p>白桐油漲風稍戢</p>
<p>白桐油自出口去路轉旺後、各處市塲均感供不敷求、而漢口市情、尤覺俏俐、因上年所抛一月份期貨、均須交解、不料到貨依然稀少、故所到客貨、此搶彼奪、據襄桐淮開至每担二十六元三四角、亦可謂缺者爲俏矣、本埠洋行亦絡繹辦進、數雖不多、然因仰給於浙桐、而浙江方面之足度現貨、已爲其搜羅一空、蓋浙省産桐乃最近十年來始見盛旺、似非川湘鄂等産桐最盛區域可比、若一經洋莊需求、自然不足供應、故近日杭市做至足度貨每砠二十七元四角、惟今庚因天旱致不足度者居其多數、所以欲借給洋莊頗費搜羅、且價格已登峯造極、辦者亦不免望而却步、近日杭函所詳交易不若前之湧旺、總因價高人心未服、且前峯期貨、亦將解齊、故形勢較前似見和穏、又因總結賬期將屆、各處正從事結束、　有交易、亦將　矣、但各處奮底均不雄厚、即去路稍　、亦不過大漲小　而　欲其大跌、恐不易實現也、</p>

<h3>對牛有感</h3>
<p>— 稜磨</p>
<p>如果「自然」不曾爲清高者建築一特殊的清高世界，清高者確總有自已去建築一個的迷夢的。那清高的世界裏的生物，都逈然不落尋常，草是幽蘭，木是寒梅，蟲是清蟬，鳥是白鶴。至於走獸，則似乎其中没有公認爲特别清高的，也許獸根本不爲清高者所關心，但至少有一種獸，多少曾與清高者發生過關係，那便是鹿。想像中的騎鹿仙人，固然是飄然而不可及，記載中養鹿的高土，可眞迷得住一些人。</p>
<p>如若養鹿的風氣現在還存在，則取以和西洋的養狗作比，眞可說雅俗相去天壤。可惜現在似乎除藥房外没有什麽人養鹿了，雖然藥房也還把牠稱作仙鹿，但那是借他的血爲自已作廣告，他們宰牠時未必不像宰一隻猪一樣。鹿堕落成這樣一種供實用的動物，自然未免可憐，但試一想他的堂兄弟牛，也就不用奇怪。</p>
<p>畫圖中的梅花仙鹿，誠然很和牛不同，但我們平常看到的鹿，是很和牛相像的。馬來半島有一種牛車，那駕車的動物，據說就實在是鹿，而被誤呌了。這說法我没有詳細考據過，不知可靠與否。那牛和中國的牛有顯然不同處，便是跑得很快。但跑得快慢，並不是牛與鹿分别的所在，我們所見的「行遲」的牛，倒反是特殊以中國牛見稱於世的。美國西部，尙有所謂「騎牛健兒」，由美國電影中的西方片及新聞片的傳播，使我們對之也頗熟悉。他們所騎的牛，就都未脫野性，奔突很猛，所以能騎者就可稱爲健兒。本來牛也都野的，中國的牛，想來也不生性，就特别遲緩，而是幾千年來用牠耕田，把牠訓練成這樣子。傳說這老子騎的靑牛，每天能走八百里，這固然許是故神其說，但古時眞曾用牛作跑路之役，讓他快走的事，也是可以有的。馬不是也儘有用作耕田，而變成行動遲緩的嗎？</p>
<p>人類的改變動物的習性的能力，誠然是可驚的，一般人却不自知這能力的偉大，他們以爲動物的被馴服，是由於動物的生理上的弱點。一個有千斤之力的牛，爲什麽能被八九歲的牧牛童控制得服服貼貼呢，據鄉下人說，是因牛的眼睛，看着人大如山，天然害怕。北方人對於那比牛還龐大的駱駝的受人控制，也作同樣的解釋。别方面，常給人類以災害的蛇，則被解釋爲其眼睛看人很小，所以敢於侵犯人。這些解釋，是不會和眞的動物心理吻合的，但人的心理却可從這些解釋看出。</p>
<p>最初，他們并不是企圖把牛眼說小了，而是想把牛的本身說小，人是的確對於極熟悉的東西都看得小些的。加爾洵在一篇小說裏，描寫兒童心理，說媽媽三尺，爸爸六尺，那說法是很有根據的。不過一般人旣已不是小孩，又也不是初民，對於顯然可以尺度比量的牛，乃不得不換一說法。但同時對於希見的動物，却每保留着初民心理。試向没有見過獅子的人問他獅子是什麽的動物，他一定以爲獅子比牛要大得多的。</p>
<p>對於某種動物認爲清高，也是應用同樣的心理。據說從前有個商人，因相信鶴是胎生的，所以對之十分珍奇，但終於看見牠下兩個蛋來，於是不禁嗒然。這樣打碎迷萝的人還是聰明的。别方面，還有一故事，某道士，相信他修眞有素，可以登仙了，於是買鶴來騎，壓死了幾隻，他還終信成仙是可能的。這雖然可笑，那種心理，却并不希奇的。</p>
<h3>舖蓋</h3>
<p>— ＴＫ</p>
<h3>雪夜過嶺記（下）</h3>
<p>— 先河</p>
<p>到那兒去休息一會吧，不論到那兒去温暖一會吧。</p>
<p>誰不是這樣想，這樣希望。可是前後左右都是黑暗，都是峭壁，摸不到，也看不清。陷在這樣一個絶境中，休息與温暖，都只是幻想。這兒只是一片迷濛，一片混沌，一個未經開闢的，不分南北的鴻荒………没有村落，没有殿宇，就連倒敗的凉亭，也没有看見一個……黑黯，寒冷……唉，只要能够見到一椽破爛的茅屋，一支搖搖欲滅的風前殘燭呵。………</p>
<p>但忽然的衝開了黑黯，傳來幾聲微弱却很清脆的「喔—喔—喔—」。</p>
<p>這是鷄叫嗎？是人問的聲音，人間的音樂嗎？</p>
<p>是的，是的，這是鷄叫，這是人間的聲音，人間的音樂。我們全這樣肯定，因此大家都振作了起來。雖則雪飄得更急，風括得更大，我們却加快了脚步，壯大了膽子，彷彿不再寒冷，甚至已經週身温暖了。我們推想這一定是個村子，是個可以投宿的地方。我們幻想着美饌，熱茶，親切的問詢，慇懃的招待，舒服的稻舖，温暖的閣樓……在那時候，也許這苦了我們半夜的飛雪，大風，泥滑艱險的嶺脊，迂廻曲折的山路，無邊無際的雲霧，都會得變成詩料，變成畫意；甚至那種茫然的恐怖，也會變成生動的，取媚主婦的插話。</p>
<p>—你想村子是在那兒呢？</p>
<p>—大約就在這山㘭後面。</p>
<p>—那末快到了罷。</p>
<p>我們拚命的走着，爬着，滑着，腦子裏儘在轉着幻想—各種各樣的，甜蜜的，浪漫的幻想。在不知不覺間，我們轉過了山㘭，翻過了峻嶺，那「喔—喔—喔」的近于音樂的聲音，一時近，一時遠，似乎現實，却又好像渺茫的在我們的耳邊響着。</p>
<p>可是轉了一個山㘭又是一個山㘭，翻了一重嶺又是一重嶺，却始終看不見一扇籬笆，一個茅舖。四周都是空濃的，寒冷的，向前看看是雲霧，朝後看看也是雲霧，本落是在那兒呢？</p>
<p>我們僵硬着，麻木着，脚簡直有時站不穏定，像浮在半空似的；有時却又重得像拖着千鈞重量，不能移動。我們的幻想消失了，重新又感到了雪夜的冷酷，行路的艱難。……往往在下雪的時候，天的半邊忽然會露出一條蔚藍，或竟現出斑爛的雲彩，久困於風雪的人總以爲天要放晴了，不覺得興高彩烈；但馬上天又灰白起來，所有的蔚藍和雲彩都在一霎眼間消失，雪又倒翻了粉桶似的滙落下來，這現象就是所謂「開雪眼」……我們希望的幻滅，也像「開雪眼」一樣的迅速，一樣的空虚……</p>
<p>我們不知道什麽時候才能翻完這無盡頭的，人生的峻嶺，但我們還是得向前走。</p>
<h3>小對比</h3>
<p>— 丁一山</p>
<p>昨天晚上去看一位朋友，看見了他新買的一册英文譯本浮士德，裝訂及插圖都十分好，譯者是Clarke吧，可惜不能把全名記得。我順手翻開了書中的序言，才知道英文的浮士德第一部的譯本有二十多種，第二部也有好多種。譯者並且在序文中說到有的已經被批評界認爲標凖的譯本，然而這位譯者還有這個勇氣與能力在有了二十多種譯本之後再譯一次，不得不令人佩服。據譯者在序文中說，他下决心譯這個「第二十幾種」的譯本已是二十多年的往事，這可使我們知道翻譯是一件很不容易的事。再者，英文德文的相似處是很多的，雖有二十多種的譯本還不能令人滿意，足見翻譯上的講究是無限的。</p>
<p>今天看南京報，却看見一件奇聞，眞是凑巧不過。有一叚啟事，登載某某二位翻譯家從日文翻譯了一册書，而且「敬告」「全國的翻譯界，」希望不要再有人去翻譯這册書。類似的事情也有過，記得好像是什麽大書店登了廣告，說有許多書現在正有人翻譯，不日出版，目的不外是謀專利，是完全商業性的。然而尙未能如此二位翻譯家登啟事「敬告」全國翻譯界莫再翻譯這樣來的别開生面。這二位翻譯家的程度我問了許多人都不知道好壞，只知道其中之一只在日本住了幾個月。對於這二位的「敬告」，我始終懷疑。</p>
<p>若說是怕别人勞而無益，這總是似乎說不過去。别人如高興去譯，誰也不能過問，這二位翻譯家的「敬告」等於白費事，等於空說。那末，這二位翻譯家多少是有點自信，覺得所譯的是標凖譯本，無須别人再譯，怕别人勞而無益也是原因在此。這眞有點不知羞了。發明可以專家，著作有版權，譯本一譯而「敬告」不要再譯，這眞找不出一個什麽來說了，也許將來會發明一個「初譯權」吧。然而初譯權與譯本好壞，與再譯又有什麽關係呢？與「敬告」又有何相干？也許是大家呌慣經濟統制，文化統制，又來實行翻譯統治不成？這似乎單把事件說出就够了。</p>
<p>中文與别種語言的差異是很大的，日文與中文的相似處，憑我個人的淺薄知識看來，不若英文德文法文間之相似處多。以牠們之相似處多，還有的書翻譯到二十多次以上，那末中文日文之相似處少，要以一種譯本而「敬告」别人莫再翻譯，眞是小孩子的玩意兒了。</p>
<p>爲求翻譯的完善，幾種譯本同時存在，是必須的，誰也不能自居盡善盡美。像戰爭與和平及安娜小史（Tolstoy：War　and　Peace;Anna　Karinina）這些浩繁的書在英國還有Garnett及Maude的兩種最通行的譯本，若是他們的讀書界見到這二位翻譯家的啟事，不免覺得中國人的本領太大了。</p>
<p>幸而翻譯界中若這二位翻譯者不多見。有好多種名著已有不同的譯本。我們更希望翻譯界多譯，比着譯，譯的更好的人不妨再譯。</p>
<h3>人間世（六）</h3>
<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>東屋和西屋一般大，這是一連脊的三間小平房。這間東屋裏没有烟具，是臥室，舖蓋陳設比較好一些。</p>
<p>一進屋，我就躺上炕，我要歇息歇息，靜一靜心神。但是，不可能，腦中偏要使我想到西屋中我的朋友抽烟情形。我在想，他領我到這裏是開的什麽風氣？他是要我賞識賞識哈爾濱的私娼，還是讓認認哈爾濱的私烟館？他又爲什麽把這地方看得很神秘的，事先還密守不宣不告訴我呢？</p>
<p>小菊也躺上炕，呆呆地同時又是好奇地注視着我。她左手上戴着三個金戒指，這時閃動着微小的亮光。我心中想：</p>
<p>「可憐的姑娘，每個戒指不知代表你多少次的失身。」</p>
<p>然而，這小烟館，我總覺得有些奇怪。旣然我不能靜下心神，莫如同她談點閒話，也許還能在不知不覺中醫好我的昏昏的頭腦。我問好道：</p>
<p>「你們怎不到街上去開烟館呢？」</p>
<p>我問這話，本是出於至誠的，她却呡嘴笑了起來，彷彿不信任我這話是眞情話。可是過一會工夫，她還是笑着回答了我：</p>
<p>「街面上房錢大呀，黎主任。」</p>
<p>「不是生意也多麽？」</p>
<p>這個小菊，人小心不小，她笑我，但這是又一種笑法，她是嘲哭，哭我當主任的還不明白這種情形，來頻頻詢問她。不然，就是她認爲我故意麻煩她。可是，她回我話時，態度可是很鄭重的。她說：</p>
<p>「不瞞您說—想來您比我們會明白這種道理的；我們這種地方，房錢小是便宜地方，不起照，有姑娘，客人並不比街上烟館少；不少，一點也不少，比那些大街上的烟館營業還要好。警察廳裏取諦烟館裏女招待你還不知道麽？單爲的抽幾口烟，没有女招待燒烟說話，烟客是不大樂意去的。明白了吧，這種道理？」</p>
<p>我雖不是警察廳的眞正主任，前些日從報紙上倒是看到一個半嚴重半好笑的新聞。報紙上說全哈爾濱的娼妓，因爲營業不振，聯合控告飯館中烟館中的女招待，控她們奪去了妓館的營業，要求官廳取諦。果然，過些天，所有飯館烟館中的女招待，都被取諦了，禁止了。可是飯館烟館因此受到營業上的損失，也眞不小，又聯合起來呈請官廳恢復原狀。官廳裏批示下來說，因爲飯館烟館是靠飯菜烟泡招攬主顧，比不了妓娼營業全靠，全靠人罷，所以拒絶了請求。</p>
<p>這是事實，這事實很快的在我的頭腦中内過去。我明白，這麽一來就給私烟館造出機會。</p>
<h3>挣扎</h3>
<p>— 三郎</p>
<p>還在舒適的家庭里過着美麗和可愛的生活那早些年頭，那會想到現在流浪的生活來得比苦酒和荆棘還要厲害呢？</p>
<p>生活的鞭子是那麽殘酷呵！緊緊地，把我從幽靜的家，黑漆似的環境里鞭到這茫茫夜也似的海上來，是偉大的希望和光明之神的驅使吧。</p>
<p>雖然這可怕的萬惡的旅途上給我深深的苦痕，雖然生活的鞭子把我摧殘得那麽蒼白的臉和深深的失掉光輝的眼睛，可是，我没有點兒反悔是自已的錯誤，這是社會所給我們的不幸呀！然而，我却痛恨了，那些帶着百把萬的商人氣似的文學家的虚僞，把我們許多困苦的筆者盡端地剝掠。</p>
<p>這時代到處都是惡蛇呢！</p>
<p>然而，愛我而又是給我悲憤的人們是那麽虔誠的：</p>
<p>「回去吧，不去過安適的生活却要送死在飢餓之途嗎？」</p>
<p>呀！滾吧，我不愛聽這樣的話呢，倘如我要回去，那麽老早便不該跑出來了，失望和刺激可能消磨掉我的心麽？</p>
<p>我等候光明，我需要偉大的熱情，雖然生活的鞭子還是那麽殘酷的駕臨我的身上，可是，我反抗，我掙扎，等到再不能够生活的地步，前途盡是死人的骷髏，那時，我要發狂，我要怒吼，我盡了我所能上的要求地做我所要做的事。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>上海商業的風景線（上）</h3>
<p>— 無螺</p>
<p>「上海灘，上海灘，上海總有坍的日子」。這話我在少時，已習聞之。自「一二八」以後，上海市面，竟至一落萬丈，大有不可收拾之勢，卽如前年結帳而論，號稱東方紐約的上海，號稱上海商業中心的大馬路，許多行號商店中，實在能够賺錢的店家，祇有兩家半，其餘僅有開支而無利息，或竟虧蝕甚鉅，而勉强維持的，實居多數。至於去年，其不景氣的現象，卽以本市而論，華租兩界，已經收歇的商店，不下百餘家，更有欲歇而未歇的，尙恐不在少數。許多新建築的富麗堂皇之店屋住宅，竟至經年無人顧問，這種情形，是開租界以來未有的慘象。若再不圖根本救濟，則江河日下，年不如年，其慘敗的印象，更不知伊於何底。</p>
<p>因此上海市第一特區市民聯合會，有主張本屆工商業大結束，延期一年，及延付房租六月的提議。此種政策，初看未始不是一種目前救急的計劃，但仔細一想，則窒礙之點甚多。我不懂得生意經，我更不懂得經濟學的原理，不過感覺得這種主張，有幾點當提出研究之處。</p>
<p>（一）去年因市面的不景氣，而延期結束一年，假定今年的商業狀况，突有起色，則去年的帳，今年或可結束。萬一市面再不景氣，或竟更甚，將若何辦法？</p>
<p>（二）就在此延期一年之中，銀錢貨物，是否仍須往來？如期仍舊，則前帳未清，安能再增新帳，如其不與往還，安知不因此藉口，而將舊帳一併不理。並且旣不往還，勢必周轉不靈，更益速其奔潰。</p>
<p>（三）現在的市面，年不如年，已可預測。去年不能結束的理由，便是虧本，不賺錢，所以延期一年結束，但是今年的現象，依舊如此，則結束一年虧本之帳，已經繁難，而欲其結束二年虧本之帳，恐更不大容易。</p>
<p>（四）工商業延期結束，則用户聞之，亦必延期結束。如此收帳益難，而商家的損失，因此益鉅。並且工商業所以每年必須結束的理由，一則不結束則贏虧將無從算起，二則恐長此交易而無結束，則其帳無法清理也。</p>
<h3>誓</h3>
<p>— 茂華</p>
<p>在天的東方懸掛着一個鮮明的希望，我無間晝夜地向着那希望走。希望的本身是不會騙人的，我知道。並且她也從不曾騙過任何人。說希望騙人的祇是若干中途脫退的低能兒，怯弱者，敗北主老者。他們不肯用不斷的努力去接近希望，握希望的手，抓住了希望作爲志願的實現，却老是站在荒山野地，遙指着希望惡駡。—說希望是欺騙了他，而絶不承認是自已的無能。不織布當然不會有衣服穿，不播種當然不會有米穀吃，不艱苦努力，當然也達不到所希望的目的。有，也許是有的，但那是不勞而獲的寄生蟲，我們正要設法剷除牠！</p>
<p>我抱了這堅强的信願，踏上征途，如今已差不多有六七年了。雖則希望之境地還不曾到達，可是已越走越近，那總是事實。你看那希望之燈是變得更鮮明了，在那天的東方，亮亮晶晶地。</p>
<p>夜了，我得坐在這石橙上，休息一下。</p>
<p>瞥了瞥那烟霧迷茫的來路，不禁微微的感到些痛楚。在那已經跋涉過的綿長的旅途，我是曾經遇到過狂風暴雨，迅雷捷電的。那時候，我是孤另另地一個，狂風搖撼着我疲乏的身子，暴兩敲擊着我蒼老的面頰，迅雷震駭着我跳蕩的心靈，捷電照射着我清癯的容顔，但我終不曾給脅迫而後退，也不曾因畏葸而遁逃，我終竟越過了難關，向前邁進！</p>
<p>我的身子雖則疲倦，可是我的心却</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>絶不疲倦。</p>
<p>狂風暴雨，迅雷捷電，那許多晴空的惡曇，旅途的阻害，對我倒並没有什麽重大的損失，雖說衣衫淋漓，步履蹌踉，但那在一個長征的浪子是常事，衣衫濕了明天會有太陽晒，步履蹌踉，還不是狂風一過便無事了。然而慣於刺痛我足趾的却是那荆棘，荆棘，遍地的荆棘！</p>
<p>「荆棘上遍生葉葉同情」，那祗是詩人愛美的幻覺，夢樣的歌詠。實際上，荆棘於一個長征的浪子是最爲不利的。但我爲着後來的人，却奮勇地熬着痛，把荆棘一叢叢都剷除了。可是荆棘叢中被驚動跳出的無數猛虎與毒蛇，又平空使我化費了全部的氣力，把牠們撲滅，宰殺，免得遺害後人。</p>
<p>我的身子更疲倦，可是我的心却更强悍。</p>
<p>我必須向着那鮮明的希望走，希望的本身是不會騙人的，我知道。不信嗎？你看，那希望之燈不是變得更鮮明了嗎？在那天的東方，亮亮晶晶地。</p>
<p>跟不上，去你的！不要老站在路的中心，指手畫脚，囂囂然惡駡。自身的没落是小事，不要妨碍别人的行進！</p>
<p>只有前進，才是我們的生路；也只有前進，才是我們的志願。—我時刻背誦着這誓言。</p>
<p>使我感到無限欣慰的是以前常祇是我孤另另地一個，現在前進的伙伴却愈　愈多了。</p>
<p>我們都相信，希望的本身是不會騙人的。</p>
<h3>獄犯待遇問題</h3>
<p>— 三多</p>
<p>前日（二十日）大晚報廣州通訊，因待遇太劣，粵看守所大批犯人拒食；同日各報本市新聞打狗團五犯刑前亦爲獄囚請願等事。</p>
<p>犯了罪，吃官司，這是天經地義的，不過亦有逍遙法外的，那是伸出手來指頭各有長短，自然可以例外。在法律上，罪犯旣已受了法律的裁判，在獄中的飲食，法律不見爲了犯罪而剝奪。俗說：「只有死罪，没有餓罪」在人情上似乎也說不過去的。　　　　　　　獄犯每日上午九時開早膳，下午四時開晚膳，（别處監獄，想來不會超乎這種待遇的）比較自由人之早點心，晚點心，半夜點心等食量，已經少至不可再少；這因爲他們是罪犯，當然不在話下。但是在這一毫八仙的兩餐伙食錢中，看守所包辦人竟發起「犯人財」來而僅發一毫，想他們從粗米飯，鹹菜羹中扣下來的大魚大肉能否安然下嚥，而不覺有些血腥臭呢？再說爲了犯法，然後入獄，監獄就是執法的塲所，像故事中農夫和律師爭論死牛問題一樣，我想，眞的想問一聲看守所包辦人的扣囚糧是否可以作爲犯罪行爲的；再進一步說，卽是法律把包辦人也來嘗嘗一毫八仙的兩餐囚飯，那些已經被　「變成皮黃骨現，兩眼也已凹落」，的囚犯恐怕也不贊同這種出氣辦法，來日方長，如何是好呢？</p>
<p>至於管監頭竟私禁刑犯於黑房，達兩月之久，自已住着亭子間，每天咒咀不見太陽，這黑房的程度想起來也同鬼門關一樣可怕了，那呌做陳漢華的恐怕要提早十五年徒刑出獄呢——亡命者中的那個棺材在車上搖擺不定的影像我至今没有消逝！</p>
<p>從前聽說有人討論獄犯的「性慾問題」，我想還是先替他們的肚子，皮肉着想吧，躺在西北風裏的犯人性交到底不是十分需要的事！</p>
<h3>殘殺的構成</h3>
<p>— 愚言</p>
<h3>回故鄉的第一天</h3>
<p>— 瑞</p>
<p>都　一年的二　　故鄉之後，一連就六七年的没有去過一趟，雖然心裏老想回去看看，可是母親却老是不允許，她的理由是：</p>
<p>「現在的鄉下比不了從前了。從前每天還可東跑西跑地去玩些有名的景地，或去看看祖先的墳墓，現在有什麽呢？到處都是共産黨，鄉下的路都不好跑，每天只有住在家裏，這又有什麽高興呢？今年我這末老了，也不想回去看看，你們年靑人，還怕没機會回去嗎？只要世界太平，那才有意思哩」！</p>
<p>一提起要回故鄉去，母親就說着這一大套話，同時就滔滔不絶地對着我講那幾十年前，她年紀還輕時，鄉下的太平世界怎末樣好，玩的地方怎末多，一直的就講到我不想聽下去的走開了才停止。因爲這樣，我也就不想再向她提起了。</p>
<p>就在我十九歲的那一年的夏天，據說鄉下的世界是太平些了，我就再向我母親提起回鄉去的話，她起初還不允，後來經我和表弟的要求，她也就没辦法的只好答應了。</p>
<p>在一個天氣很酷熱的早晨，東方的天才一露白，和表弟就離開了S市的碼頭，坐着小火輪回鄉去。</p>
<p>很多年没有回到故鄉，一看見了遠遠地擺在視綫中地的故鄉，心裏是感到多麽的高興呀！那一帶的蔓延森密地竹叢，綠油油地包圍着我的故鄉的四週，在竹叢裏，高高地笠立着那很高的韓文公亭。亭上的紅　蘆已經是塌下去了一　　　　　雖　　　　　　多　　那我</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>還認得，在那葫蘆亭的南面就是我的家裏了。</p>
<p>越跑越近了，心裏也跟着愈高興了。雖然明知這幾年來鄉下的情况很不好，但心裏却老是想：幾年没回來，一定會變得比前更好些了。</p>
<p>抱着滿心的興奮，穿過了竹林，就走進了村門了。突然地，使我心裏感到可怕和冰冷了，我想：故鄉，原來變成這個樣子了。進村門的這條大路上，從前不是很熱閙嗎？現在却變成這樣的冷落了，一個人影都没有，就是鷄狗也没有一隻。兩旁的房子，東倒西歪的没有一家人家，那些朱紅色的門板都没有，只留下那堆滿着瓦礫的半塌倒的石門柱。到底爲什麽會這樣呢？難道人都死光了不成嗎？</p>
<p>一種莫明其妙和灰冷地思緒佔據着我的深心，剛才那在遠遠地路上跑時的興奮，是一點也没留住地給這眼前的印象打散去了。</p>
<p>家門是到了，我放重着脚步地走了進去。</p>
<p>「呵！芝叔回來了，幾年都没來一趟呢！你媽媽呢？」</p>
<p>一個蓬鬆着頭髮，穿着藍布衣服的中年婦人，站在井邊洗衣服，她聽到了我的脚步聲，猛抬起頭望了我的臉沉思了一下。她那已經失去了靑春的蒼黃的臉孔，纔露出了一絲地笑影，走到我的面前問着。當她走近我的時候，這時我才看清楚了，這就是瑞賢嫂。</p>
<p>三姆，二姆，三嫂，大嫂聽到了是我回來了，一齊地都從那上下廳裏跑出來。我一面和她們談話和問安，一面却注意着她們每人的面孔和身體，這使我感到無限地悲哀，我想：她們一個個都老了，蒼瘦了，特别使我注意的是瑞賢嫂。</p>
<p>在幾年前，我回鄉的時候，她纔剛和瑞賢哥結婚，那時她是多末的年靑呀，多末的漂亮呀，全村的人，都說她是頂好看了。瑞賢哥那時也是年壯力强，做生意也很順利，所以誰都說，她倆眞是一對好夫妻。可是，現在畢竟是變了，瑞賢哥還流浪到南洋去了，很富的家業都破了産，瑞賢嫂也就只好給人做半傭工和在家裏操作了。那靑春的美麗，甜蜜的人生，在她是失去了，臉上已起了縐紋，眼睛是灰黃色了。</p>
<p>第一天回到故鄉，一切就使我失望了，在我的心中更蒙上了一層灰色的愁悶。我想：</p>
<p>「農村的破産，是這樣的厲害呀」！</p>
<h3>汕頭孤兒院</h3>
<p>— 毓炯</p>
<p>暮秋的南國，飄着微熱的暖風，温和的人感覺有如初春時一陣陣的倦意，由於丙的提議，要我們一同去參觀孤兒院，在汕頭市的孤兒院，算是一個比較有名的奇景似的，凡是到了汕頭去過的人，無有不去觀光一下。因此，我之參觀孤兒院的意思，當然亦不能例外。秋色反映在南國的街頭，秋風捲動着塵土飛舞，我們沿着兩旁的石子馬路走，天空飄着輕輕的白雲，使我們忘記了沉重的步伐，像度仙似的，在柳絲掃動着的街道上漫步着，直抵了孤兒院的大門。丙代我們簽了一個名之後，先是由丙直接引導我們上樓，因爲丙曾往來過一次，他知道一些這裏面的情形，當然比我們詳細，樓上是男女孤兒的宿舍，分開來的，四面都寫着各種不同的標語，帶着鼓勵兒童們怎樣做人的口氣。然後再下樓來，則見各個兒童正在下着旗跳着圈子，有些女的，她們亦在織着手工，做着紅綠顔色的紙頭的花……這是他們的遊戲塲，引導我們的人這樣對我們說了。接着我們又抽轉身來，看見另外一部份兒童，正在上着課，據說他們每天都有幾點鐘的功課之外，也有幾點鐘遊戲，其餘的時間，則到工廠裏做幾小時的工。兒童們都是天眞的，活潑的，同天之驕子一般的，所不同者，就是因爲這社會制度不好，使得他們在很小的時候，就失去了慈母的養育將他們投置在這孤兒院裏養着的。</p>
<p>汕頭孤兒院的設備，是比較宏偉壯觀，除了孤兒所的設置外，其餘在後面的一排　　　就是神經病患者的收養所，再後面則是孤兒醫院，膳　，還有工廠　盡都是由於兒童成年後所担任的工作；成績陳列室，是那工廠的所有出品，我們繞着一個大的圈子，仔細的參觀了一番之後，我們便買了一個那些兒童們自已所製造出來，擺在陳列室的怪精巧的竹簍，提着竹簍跨出了大門。夕陽高照在天空的又一角，熱度像是低了些，没有先前那般的照人。我們都懷着一顆滿足的心，爲這一班失去了歸宿的兒童羣慶幸。</p>
<h3>古刹梵音</h3>
<p>— 野菲</p>
<p>篤…篤…篤篤…噹……在離開橋頭鎭不遠的一個村子里，早晚總有那紅魚和靑磬的聲音，隠隠然的蕩漾，在這村子的週遭，每天是這樣，没有間斷過一次。</p>
<p>這是從兪家渡裏的一隻水仙菴里送出的，那菴就在村的最前面，要是有人跑進村去，那首先和你的眼簾接觸的便是那隻水仙菴，這雖是隻尼姑菴，但它在這村中的勢力却不小，而且相傳那菴是鎭壓這村裏風水的，所以人們也很敬畏他。</p>
<p>那菴裏的住持是一個壯健的老尼姑，她約莫四十來歲，除她之外還有兩個十多歲的小尼姑，和一個二十多歲的。她們的唯一收入，除了人家來燒香的捐助，和小尼姑出去募化，向村裏人家打齋飯，及出賣經懺外，自已也耕種些田地，而且老尼姑更將些餘錢去向村裏人家重利盤剝。</p>
<p>那老尼姑是個佛面蛇心的人，最可惡的是她十分勢利，見了窮人不放在眼裏，見了有財有勢的却濫拍馬屁。她更風騷，那個姘頭阿根和尙，也三日兩頭住在這菴里的，只要他三天不來，她便打發小尼姑去喊他了，有時甚至自已上門去請他。她待别人却彷彿奴隸，别說小尼姑不稱她的心就要挨打，便是那中年的，也常常要給她駡的。「這里你不願住去好了，本來人家又不曾請你來，年紀輕輕去嫁個老公好得多，何必要來當尼姑自討苦吃呢？，你要在這裏就是這樣的…………」</p>
<p>首先看見了她那股騷勁已經有些不耐，並且她還要來這樣奚落她，諷刺她，使她實在傷心。照心裏委實受不下去，要想回她的嘴，預備不住這裏，但再一回想，覺得又是不能够，不能够，心里一陣子酸楚，兩行熱淚便篤落落的淌了下來。</p>
<p>她踱進了佛殿，在觀世音面前那盞琉璃燈里加了燈油，佛桌上的香盤里看看香已點完了，她連忙接了香，坐到傍邊一隻經桌上，翻開了那本「多心經」，篤…篤…篤…噹「南無摩訶般若波羅密多」，她木魚是儘管不合節奏的敲，敲，敲，心里却在開始翻開她那本傷心史來搜尋了。她今年才廿三歲，廿三歲的人，靑春就不該讓它無代價的逝去，但那老尼姑的烏氣呢？唉！眞悔不該要來當尼姑！不，千怪萬怪都是自已的命運生得太不濟了。丈夫和我結婚纔一年，就丢了苦命的我而去了！我自從丈夫死了就打定主意，誠心替他守寡的，可是那萬惡的家庭太不諒人，而且丈夫唯一的一個遺腹子也不到一歲就夭殤了！於是他們要逼着我嫁給堂叔，那堂叔的醜態，我只要看了就討厭的，何况還要呌我去嫁他！我不從，他們就無情地把我攆了出來，我當時伏在丈夫的墳上哭了一塲，後來决意落髮來做尼姑，也好讓我在佛前來懺悔懺悔我的前世，修修下世，同時還可超度了死去的丈夫。但是那老尼姑太不體諒人家的苦衷了，她偏時常要來譏笑我，使我難堪；啊！總之我命太苦了，所以隨便到什麽地方，都是一樣的！</p>

<p>春蠶養罷秋蠶忙。有許多少年村婦採靑桑。農家只爲謀温飽。農婦是晝夜辛勤眠食忘。燈火終宵忙不息。吃的是黄米靑鹽荳腐湯。采來濕葉須揩拭。春寒更把火盆裝。倘然旦春響雷。嚇得那蠶婦担憂哭上蒼。故而是養蠶結繭非容易。勞力勞心苦飽嘗。年來是中國絲商挫銳氣。多只爲敵國陰謀暗箭傷。可恨那搗亂絲商用人造貨。因此是國産絲綢受中傷。但願得政府發明科學器。挽救蠶絲要改良。要知道羊去補牢猶未晚。振作精神絲業昌。更勸那全國養蠶指導所。感化農塲竭力要帮忙。製造廠剔選須努力。競爭絲繭可興邦。方能够大中華實業永無疆。</p>

<h3>中央電影攝影塲徵求演員之標準</h3>
<p>— 黄天佐</p>
<p>這次中央爲推動電影文化事業，展開電影宣傳路綫起見，决在最近期間，擴充中央電影攝影塲，除原有江東門外之無聲影塲之外，將另擇環境較佳的地點，建築一座最完善的有聲攝影塲。關於該塲在物質上的設備，已得各專家的勷助，自然可以切合歐美現代影塲的各種條件。除此之外，目前我們最注意的就是演技人材的羅致問題。</p>
<p>演員是電影藝術表現的最重要工具。有優秀的演員—卽工具，纔有强有力的表現，媒介。至於演員—卽工具—本身如何可能達到優秀的境域，則要視乎個人所經過的藝術的修養及環境的鍜鍊了。</p>
<p>一個藝人的藝術與生活有密切的聯繫，這是誰都不能加以否認。如果要使中國電影業組織化或紀律化—我以爲這是建設電影企業的最主要條件—則不獨要使每個從業電影的藝人熟習了基本的藝術常識，同時他們的個人的行爲生活最少亦需歸納到一條紀律化的與凖繩化的軌道；尤其是充作電影的衣冠的演員們，他們是這般的排設及宣傳，好讓羣衆去愛護，崇拜及充當神聖的偶像的。假使他們的生活一旦避出軌道，於是殘酷地幻滅了羣衆的理想，使羣衆對他們所愛護的，所崇拜的正義和美發生動搖，而人類社會的紀律亦將無辜地在無形中損失羣衆的信任了。</p>
<p>現在中央電影攝影塲在滬·京·平三地舉行大規模的演員徵求，我們的選取標凖除在廣告上所刋登的根據每個人之（一）面部輪廓；（二）動作姿態；（三）表演能力之外，我們想特别提出的就是我們對於演員的行爲生活也同樣的重視。在過去，電影圈確當有過一度黑暗時期，於是凡是潔身自愛的男女都離開了牠。年來中國電影業正在抬頭，這些不正確的觀念早該消除了。何况中央電影攝影塲是一個國營的製作機關，並非其他帶着商業性質者可比，在本塲服務的就是替國家服務。我希望凡是對電影感覺興趣或對藝術素有修養的一切份子—尤其是男女學子們—從前對於影片公司是裹足不前的，都應該齊集我們的陣營來。</p>
<p>我們又要知道幹電影决不是投機牟利，當電影演員决不是投機取名。一切都要根據科學組織和藝術構成方法，纔可以鞏固這新興藝術的浮薄基礎。偶然的機會主義與過份的物質供養都是不合理化的組織原子，崩潰不過是遲早問題。金元國的「明星制」不足爲我們取法，或者値得我們參考的祇有蘇俄的「藝人制」而已。</p>
<p>在中央電影攝影塲徵求演員伊始，我們要表白的就是在將來中央的演技人材的陣營裏，絶對不會容許有機會主義的存在。一切人材都在黨的指導下給與平等發展的機會。至於酬勞方面，則以保障生活舒適爲標凖。不合理化的過份豐裕，適足以造成生活的淫靡與奢浮，並不是本黨所希望的。將來在演技上或藝術上如有特殊貢獻的份子，我們或者更進而賜給他們以「國家名譽藝人」Honoured　artist　of　the　Republic及或其他榮銜，亦未可定。</p>
<p>至於中央電影攝影塲將來的作品，我們是要採取新的作風，走上新的路綫。所以新的人材的羅致，實爲急不容緩的事情。請讀者不要小看自已，也許你就是一位未來的人材。還要附帶說的就是這次徵求演員直至二月十日截止，上海報名處在漢口路同安里三十七號國際新聞攝影社。</p>
<h3>藝術家心目中天下最美的女子</h3>
<p>— 福</p>
<p>美國紐約最著名的美術家，弗雷德摩根（FrMorgan），最近發表了如下的談話；</p>
<p>「普天下最美的女子？」常常有人問着我。我到現在，才敢干冒了大不韙，來說幾句話。可是我要請那些没有被我提到的，多多原諒。</p>
<p>合乎理想的摩登女子，一定要有男性吸引力（Male　Appeal—注意，這就是性感SA的别名。）在這點上，我挑選了琪恩哈羅。她雖然有許多其他的美點，但是，不可思議的，她却以富有吸引男子的魔力，最爲人注意。</p>
<p>再則除了美貌之外，我的理想美女，一定要具有神秘密性和光艶，像瑪琳黛德麗許那樣的。雖然有人不同意我的話，但是我深信一個女子的稱爲眞美，一定要具有神女的誘惑性。在這點上，好萊塢没有比瑪琳黛德麗許更富有神秘密的誘惑性的了。</p>
<p>我看到了瓊勃郎黛兒，我尋到了藝術家所夢想的一個全美女子的體格。她像猫一樣的黃條，但却又壯碩康健，可以說摩登女子因爲嗜好運動的緣故，已經將她們的體格進化了，超越了她們前輩所夢想到的美健。</p>
<p>一個眞正的美女，亦一定要富有女性的温柔。在這一點上，我想起了珍妮蓋諾。她那種嬌小玲瓏的體態，温婉宜人的舉止，實在可以使千萬男女靑年，將她奉爲羅曼斯的圭臬。</p>
<p>最後，但亦不是最不重要，瓊克勞馥亦是我心目中標凖美女的一部份。我所看到的就是她的聰明，勇敢，都是摩登美女所不可不具有的特性。</p>
<p>合了起來說，琪恩哈羅的吸引力，瑪琳黛德麗許的艶麗，瓊勃郎黛兒的體格，珍妮蓋諾的温柔，和瓊克勞馥的聰慧，團合起來，才成爲一個藝術家心目中的摩登美人。美女呀，美女，眞是不容易尋到呀！</p>

<h3>袁牧之窮極上當舖</h3>
<p>爲了社會的不景氣，影響到今年的商店，銀行大量的、倒閉。但，祇有當舖，因着貧窮者加多，生意却意外的興隆。爲了貧苦者的需要，電通特在斜土路開設了一爿當舖，該舖門面由張雲齊設計，異常美觀，近日來，工匠們正粉刷油漆，忙碌非凡，主人且已擇定黃道吉日，本月二十日正式開幕。窮詩人白華（袁牧之飾）因無錢使用，將於是日前去抵質衣服。聞白華所以不土其他老當舖而赴該新開幕當舖之原因。是貪圖新當舖能多當幾錢云。</p>
<h3>月明公司的新展望</h3>
<p>月明公司在一九三四年很沉寂，因爲他們在有計劃的做拍有聲片的準備，第一部昏狂，經了導演任彭年幾個月的努力，已全部告成，不久即將公映，而在一九三五年開始的現在，將進行開拍大批聲片。已决定的有李法西編的流亡，丁丁編的女戰士，曹雪松編的船娘，王平陵編的苦鬥，左明編的鵬程萬里等五部。那末在一九三五年，月明將有猛進的發展了。</p>
<p>一般的明星，都是愛跳舞，但是月明公司的鄥麗珠，她却不同，她歡喜騎馬，擅駕駛汽車；她駕駛汽車的技術很高明，而住已經有了很久的歷史，據月明導演任彭年說，她取得工部局的執照，已經有五年了，她眞是中國唯一的尙武明星。</p>
<p>月明第一部聲片昏狂，是由任彭年導演的，現已完成，即將公映。在昏狂裏，有一支歌，就是婚狂歌，李法西作歌，鍾竹如譜曲，由主角鄥麗珠主唱，歌詞慷慨，歌調激昂，現已印就，分贈各界，凡欲索閱者，可附郵票一分，寄海格路月明公司宣傳部，當即寄奉。（却）</p>

<h3>紅羊豪俠傳（一）新華影業公司出品</h3>
<p>— 兆初</p>
<p>在絶妙的一片村景之中，充滿着大自然的美。那邊遠遠地看見兩隻秃驢，上面跨着兩個人，得得的走着。他們背後還有隨從的人，肩上挑着衣包行李。驢子頸項上的銅鈴丁令丁令地響着，走了過來。</p>
<p>他們走過了一條長橋，那驢上英姿颯爽的洪秀全，忽然聽到了前村一片呼喝責打之聲，便向馮雲山道：「這大約又是那班狗官爪牙在那裏威福橫行了。我們何妨前去瞧看一看？」馮雲山便和他勒韁而下，向前看去。洪秀全看了果然不錯，便憤然感歎着道：「我們漢人受着滿族的宰割，什麽時候方可以吐氣呢？」馮雲山聽着他的說話，當即說道：「洪大哥！你怎麽英雄氣短？難道怕將來達不到你我的志願嗎！」洪聽了馮的話，搖了搖頭說：「像我一個不及第的秀才，上握不到政權，下又不得民心，怎麽能行我們的志願呢？」馮連忙回答說：「你太小看了自已了。漢朝的劉邦，明朝的朱元璋，他們都不是布衣匹夫嗎？」洪凝神想了一想，向馮微微笑了一笑道：「這纔是時勢造英雄，英雄造時勢啊！」馮雲山忽然想到了一件事，便很興奮的說道：「聽說花縣朱九濤，心懷大志，現在設立上帝會，外面傳教佈道，暗中結納人心，想恢復明室，你我何不去加入那會，相機行事哩？」洪聽了感到興奮的說：「旣有這個機會，你何不早說？我們立刻就去加入。」馮當然很贊同，便縱　加鞭行去，驢子的鈴聲，也漸漸的遠了。</p>
<p>很熱閙的街市上，那坐着綠呢大橋，頂戴顯赫的官兒排着儀仗，呼吆喝道的衝過，把一個算命的盲人，撞倒在地，跌破了頭顱，鮮血淋漓。旣而行經一家店舖門前，門前所攙着許多東西。差役以爲有礙儀仗執事，便把那些東西一脚踢去，東西紛紛的倒下。舖裏的人，急忙收拾地下的東西，一面氣憤的駡着：「用不着這樣欺負人。我們做小生意的，並没有犯什麽法呀。」他正在詛咒着，忽的走上兩個差役，把他抓住，惡狠狠的問說：「你敢駡誰？」那人惶急的回答說：「我没有敢駡什麽人。」那差人不容分說，就把那人拖了過去。那洪秀全剛巧打那裏經過，看了他們這種情形，義形於色的說道：「這個世界，究竟是什麽世界？這個天下，究竟是什麽人的天下，」馮雲山聽了，四面驚顧着，拉了洪秀全的衣袖，兩人便一同走了過去。</p>
<p>在一間教室裏面，那裏放着十多排椅子，四面墙上掛着許多耶穌傳教的圖畫。當洪馮走進屋裏，那奏琴的立即住了琴聲，走到兩人身旁說道：「師傳已經在地室等你們二位了。」洪馮聽了，隨即走入内間去。那裏是圖書室的佈置，二人走入，在一處暗機關後面，現出一門，從門走下地室裏去。那地室不很廣大，中間設了香案，當中供的是朱洪武的神像。那朱九濤正倚坐在一張軟榻上，穿着道人的衣裝。他年紀老了，精神很委頓。看見二人進來，連連的招呼。二人也趁此到朱九濤前行了禮。朱九濤略舒喘息，緩緩的說道：「我借着傳佈道義，暗地想恢復明室。誰知幾十年來毫無成效。可恨我現在已經年老力衰，無能爲力的了。我眞是對不起祖宗。」說着，不禁流下淚來。　（未完）</p>

<h3>建築史有建立的必要</h3>
<p>— 嚴明</p>
<p>我們知道，顯現於我們眼前的宇宙萬物，尤其是供我們人類衣，食，住，行……等等享受的東西，牠們的本體原來與我們此刻所見到所接觸到的，在質量上根本是不相同的，牠們的質量，是隨着那時間的演進而在不斷的改變。昔日的猿猴，便是今日的「文明的」人類；而今日的人類，也就是昔日渾身是毛不能言語的猿猴。由此，我們可以正確的斷定，不一定人類進化的情形是這樣，天地間任何事物，蓋莫不有其時間性。這種受時間性的限制而變化其形態，無形中便創造了歷史。當此二十世記科學鼎盛時代，人類的生活，除有攏統的縱的與橫的包羅萬象的通史外，對於單獨的縱的個别史的研究，也在同樣的努力着。實在像這樣追溯過去歷史上的痕跡的事情，太重要了，牠不僅是爲了要知道過去，並且是爲着開展將來。建築是解决人類生活的要素之一，尤其是在現代社會，其所佔地位的重要，凡稍具常識的人，已是誰都知道的事情。然而我們要追溯今日建築之已往的痕跡，首先便需要檢查「建築史」。我們固然需要知道現代建築，那高聳雲霄，美奐美侖的現代都市建築，但亦需要知道我們最先的祖宗，曾經像飛鳥似的「營巢而居」，像走獸般的掘地而眠。這種營巢掘地的生活，現代人除歷史家考古家外，恐怕都不知道，亦不欲知道的。上古人類的營巢而居，掘地而眠的生活，雖屬簡單粗陋之極，但他們絶對需要「建築」而居住的要求，與現代人住的高樓大厦的舒適的生活，初無二致。現代人只知在高樓大厦中姿意享樂，不知道假使不經過「營巢而居」，「掘地而眠」的階段，那裏來有今日的高樓大厦？同樣的，好像不經過茹毛飲血，或披樹葉以裏身，便没有今日的飽食暖衣：不先有小車，帆船，那有今日的輪船……飛機？而歷史便是告訴我們此中遞嬗的痕跡。在現代許多種類的歷史中，我們知道，有個别的政治史，經濟史，社會史，人類戰爭史………郤找不到一部單獨完全的建築史。建築一門，在現代社會，旣佔這樣重要的地位，關於建築方面的一切學問，旣已有了「建築學」，然而郤没有一部建築史，實爲建築界亦學術界之一大憾事。若然現在有很多人要想知道建築的遞嬗的痕跡，將怎麽辦？那麽在這裏，建築史就非建立不可了。也只有建立了建築史，才能適當的解决上述的問題。</p>
<p>關於建築史的知識，這是凡屬現代社會的人，需要建築以生活的人，所必須具備的普通常識；至於建築家與工程設計家，他們一向只是在技術方面努力，對於極重要的建築史，却一向是忽略的，我們認爲現代的建築家與工程設計家，他們除在努力於現代建築的技術的研究與改造外，對於建築史的知識，更非有切實的通曉不可。因爲這種知識，乃屬他們的本行呵。</p>
<p>最後我們還得說：關於建築史建立的必要，已略如上述；但如何以建立建築史——一部單獨完善的建築史，這一個責任，惟有希望博通古今的歷史家去担負了。本文不過約略述個梗槪，預先提起對於建築史建立的必要的一個注意而已。</p>
<h3>談厦門的建築</h3>
<p>— 楊德惠</p>
<p>厦門，是我國南部的一個大都市，雖然比不上廣州，但除了廣州，無疑地，仍然是一個大都市呢？在我未談厦門建築前，對於都市和建築的關係先來一說：我們知道一種建築的式樣，是有許多背景的，如什麽，氣候，政治，宗教，民族性……等，這些，都和建築上式樣有密切的連繋，所以，都市建築的變遷，並非是偶然的，因建築的變遷，對於材料的改進，也是有很大的關係，換句話說，建築是因科學的進步和物質的文明而變遷的，今日的鋼筋三合土發明，所以，才有摩天的建築，舉一反三，建築和材料的變遷，原由於世界的演進，厦門也何嘗不如此呀！</p>
<p>厦門的名稱的由來，始於明太祖二十年，命江夏侯周德興建城爲厦門城，他是個四面環海的島嶼，所以其境内多是岡陵起伏，錯落如珠璣，而很少平原的地方，在其全市的面積，統計三十七萬九千六百餘方丈，除掉低地，河池，山麓以外，能建築的面積，不過三十三萬餘方丈倘使把所有十八萬一千八百○二人口來比例，那末，每人所佔的面積，平均祗兩方丈弱，在這種情勢下，顯見得有地狹人稠之感了，除非是開山塡地，另拓新區外，實在是無法可容納人口的增加於未來呢！所以，市政當局，曾開拓完成十三萬方丈的新市區，並且仍在繼續地的進行開拓，以厦門地勢的雄偉和位置的重要，其建築的發展，固是我們預料中，因爲厦門多山而鮮少平原，故其建築，亦有如香港式，尤其是新拓的市區建築物，在厦門建築物可分舊式和新式來說，舊式的建築，大多是平房，其式樣成爲長方形，而且很是低矮，完全是我國鄉村建築的表現，屋脊的兩端，像鳩尾般的形狀，屋頂呢，當然是斜水形了，看去好似廟宇的建築；至其内部的設計，走進大門，便是一個天井，面積大的，大都分前後兩宅和左右的兩廂房，建築的材料，十足地是完全國貨，漳州石碼一帶的紅色赭色磚瓦，在厦門的舊式建築上，都是普遍的採用，柱椽栅擱樓板的木材，是用内地的杉木和杵木，牆壁用本島各山岩上所産的花崗石來砌的，門窗的裝置，大多是不講究衛生上的原則，在這裏有個特點，其地板的上面，都加舖赭色方磚一層，是顧慮防火却熱的設計呢！雖然，厦門舊式建築，不止限於上面所講的式樣，但在全體舊式建築上，確可代表舊式建築式樣的一般，至新式的建築，在都市中，正是一天一天的發展起來，而且是很迅速的向前着，厦門因華僑及地勢關係，其新式的建築，也日見其蓬勃了，對於構造的式樣和原料，力求其現代化和堅固，所以，在從前熱閙中心的偏於西南隅一帶，自從新區開拓後，漸漸地移到新區來了，這因爲新區的建築，多是新建，而且新建的式樣，當然是和舊式不同，而趨新時代的新式建築，所以，在其近五年來，新式建築在新區裏，已有四千幢了，這種新式建築的産生，唯一的原因，就在受了現代生活的影響，並且現代都市的集中，大多是工商企業，因而人口的澎漲，也使建築的趨向於新式的又一原因，因爲是這樣，所以厦門的新建築，至少是二層，四五層的高樓，現在也有的不少落成呢！他的式樣，採取香港式，沿馬路的兩旁人行道，都是建築騎樓，房屋每間的闊度，普通在一丈一二尺，遠望起來，眞有如鴿籠般，至其建築材料，都是鋼骨水泥，以資堅固，隨着時代輪子的推進，建築式樣的逐漸改新，在厦門，正是蓬勃發達的過程中，况且，其沿海堤岸，現在積極的進行，將來全部工程完成後，其建築事業的前途，不難想知其更甚發達於今日了。</p>
<p>（編者按）（一）厦門島雖有不少山脈，但新市還完全是平原，所謂「岡陵起伏」是在厦門對面的鼓浪嶼；（二）積極建設；改造市容，還是三年前的事，那時由漳厦警備司令部負責辦理，頗具規模，近兩年來，未有若何進展；（三）沿海堤岸，曾費數百萬工費，四五年時光，大致完成，近一年來，已陷於停頓之勢。厦島爲我舊游之地，情形比較熟悉，特爲附誌於此。</p>

<p>第一章　總論</p>
<p>第一節　範圍</p>
<p>建築材料學之範圍，其所論者當以建態應用所必需之材料爲限，本篇所述者，大要可列爲四：</p>
<p>一，材料之原料及其製造方法之素描，</p>
<p>二，材料之普通及特殊性質之介紹；</p>
<p>三，材料應用各項必具條件之認識；</p>
<p>四，材料試騐方法之一斑。</p>
<p>其它則市面行情通用慣例，爲記者管見之所能及者，亦將盡量加入，以貢一得之見。</p>
<p>第二節　建築材料之性質</p>
<p>材料之性質，其可論者極夥，茲擇其有用於建築工程，而値得吾人注意之各項性質，列舉名目，說明如左：</p>
<p>一，力能—是爲材料之能力，顯示其足以任受外力，至如何程度，而尙能支持不仆。此種力能通常慣用者有五類，計爲（甲）拉力，（乙）壓力，（丙）剪力，（丁）彎力，（爲拉力與壓力混合而成），及（戌）絞力是也。</p>
<p>二，彈性—是爲材料因受外力而形態變動後，當外力移去時卽能恢復原狀之一種特性。</p>
<p>三，堅固程度—是爲材料承受如何外力，而形態無變之性質。</p>
<p>四，脆弱和度—是爲材料承受如何外力而形態分裂之性質。</p>

<h3>建築行話（四）</h3>
<p>— 梅震寰</p>
<p>—關於築塲裏用—</p>
<p>堂子——堂子這二字，在上海某一階級中人的目光裏，或須要神經過敏地猜想到倡門中的所謂堂子，（卽窑子解），其實現在所話的堂子，（Frame）就是門（Doot）或賞(　　　　　)的木　　大點建築房屋到第一層平面綫時，依照圖樣上，假定有門的地位，那末，這時候就該將堂子豎起，築塲裏的切口呌立堂子</p>
<p>羊角—堂子的邊挺（Sike　Style）</p>
<p>靠外兩旁留有空隙，這空隙和墻身用羊角（Wooden　Dowel）使之接牢，則堂子不致搖動，它是用木料製成的，做法，一頭埋在墻身，一頭吃在堂子裏。</p>
<p>穿弓！—穿弓（Sction）不是用以射箭的弓，是建築師繪出的斷面樣。</p>
<p>翻水—(Sbotpe)譬如房屋内天井或廚房，平屋頂面，天溝(Gutter)等或其他關於漏水的地方，其平面必定有些傾斜，這傾斜的緣故，是使水量容易流瀉。</p>
<p>浸—磚塊的性質是燥烈的居多，所以在砌墻前，預先浸入水内，使之濕透，然而砌墻，這磚塊就呌浸磚。</p>
<p>磉皮—（Support）普通房屋立柱子（Clumn）所用基石，考究的在柱子身有圓形石磴，這是磉子。</p>
<p>凹綫—(Fillet)踢脚綫(Skirting）和地板（Foor)相接處的陰角度的三角綫條。</p>
<p>台度—(Dado)什麽呌台度，它是一種適宜於廚房之類用以避免墻身損壞或火患，大槪用黄沙水泥做成，高度五尺以上，八尺以下，然而現在往往將它做了裝飾上的襯托品，例如穿堂咧，客堂咧，但它的用料是洋松和柳安，甚至柚木也會用作台度呢。</p>
<p>出綫—好像壓詹墻（Purapet）上的壓頂(Caping)詹口(Eave)或窗盤(Window　Sill)底下的小元綫，這些都呌出綫，也有呌水落綫(Drip)的。</p>
<p>台形—在上海所謂白相人也者有一句呌做「着台形」，猶之爭面子的意思，然而在築塲裏，對於台形二字，這不是這解說了，它是帮助另一件東西上的一種助力的設備，普通也呌它是惠林（Waling)</p>
<p>送椿—（Following　File）打椿到地面而未達原有平水綫，必須依賴送椿　　椿箍—(Lron　Hoop)防木椿受重量打擊後易於碎裂，於是在椿頂套以鐵箍。</p>
<p>元規—（Compass）是建築師應用的一種繪劃圖樣的儀器，形狀像一把尖頭的义，所以也有呌肩义的，其實肩义另外有的一種儀器。</p>
<p>開賬—作頭（Constrator）在打樣間或東家（就是業主）那裏拿出的房屋樣子，作頭對於它必需要嚴肅的計算和佔價，這就呌開賬，假使在確實了造價以後，同時選定那個作頭做的時候，再不能稱開賬了，然而呌什麽呢，築塲裏的切口呌「拆賬」。</p>
<p>居壁架—（Shelf）普通在廚房或伙食間裏，用木料製成的三角架，上面舖了板，可以放置東西的。</p>

<p>(Beiping) The Eastern Chahar incident is currently being negotiated by Qin Dechun and Yue Kaixian with Matsui, the Japanese military liaison officer stationed in Zhangjiakou.

<h3>Yang's Bandits Fled into Northern Shaanxi</h3>
<p>Zhao Chengshou's Remarks</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhao Chengshou said that after Yang Houxiao was incorporated in Chahar Province, he eventually reverted to his bandit nature and rebelled completely. When the bandits fled from Chahar to Suiyuan, they had complete guns and horses, numbering over 2,000. I dispatched five regiments to coordinate with the troops of Fu Zuoyi and Wang Jingguo, etc., and after less than a week of joint pursuit and suppression, the Yang bandits fled into northern Shaanxi. His deputy leader, Kang Cunliang, was killed by government troops in Inner Mongolia. Since the remnants of the bandits fled into northern Shaanxi, in addition to sending a cavalry brigade and an infantry regiment to maintain strict guard in the Dongsheng County area to await suppression, we also telegraphed the troops stationed in northern Shaanxi to drive them out of the border so that they could be fundamentally eliminated. This time, the 2,000+ Yang bandits were ambushed along the way by infantry and cavalry, and about 500-600 were killed, and 500-600 fled. Now only 300-400 bandits remain, and it will not be difficult to eliminate them. The matter of joint defense by Shanxi, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Shaanxi is currently being discussed by the responsible authorities of each province. Yang Hucheng's representative has arrived in Bing to negotiate. In the future, after this matter is implemented, it will surely be effective in suppressing the bandits.

We hope that everyone will work hard, practically, diligently, and quickly. (2) In terms of military affairs, the bandits in northern Guizhou are currently in the Zunyi and Mei area, which is a good opportunity to eliminate them. The Yunnan army in western Guizhou will arrive in Bijie soon. There are Central Army troops in southeastern Guizhou and a strong river defense in the north, which has been solidified. The defenses in northern Sichuan have also been tightly deployed, and it is absolutely difficult for the bandits to flee. After crossing the Jialing River in the future, the Sichuan army's steps will be consistent, and it will be able to work hard to suppress the bandits. (3) In terms of politics, Commander-in-Chief Liu himself is honest and clean, and the Central Government has entrusted him with the power to concurrently take office, with special responsibility, in order to achieve great results. The suffering of the Sichuan people lies in the heavy taxes and levies. The way to relieve them is to first seek financial unity, break down the defense areas, unify the whole of Sichuan, and the heavy taxes and levies can be reduced and exempted. Sichuan's finances will be reorganized by the Finance Department and the Sichuan Finance Special Commissioner. There are also financial personnel in our group to study alongside them. The first step is to conduct an investigation, the second step is to prepare a plan, and the third step is to implement it. (21st Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Huichang, in his report on the significance of aviation construction at the Central Government’s bi-weekly memorial ceremony on the 21st, stated that aviation construction has become a major aspect of modern nations. Only thirty years have passed since the invention of the airplane, and after numerous improvements, it has become not only a major tool in national defense but also an indispensable tool in other transportation constructions. Countries around the world are actively engaged in aviation construction. We should all promote it and arouse our fellow countrymen to concentrate their efforts on enriching aviation construction to realize the aviation-based national salvation goal that the Premier hoped for us.

<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held its bi-weekly memorial ceremony on the morning of the 21st. Deng Jiayan, Chen Shuren, Wang Yongbin, Lin Xiang, Lü Chao, Wei Huai, and staff members from various departments and ministries, totaling over 500 people, attended. After Chairman Lin led the assembly in performing the rituals, Shao Yuanchong gave a report, stating that the Party and Political Affairs Conference had resolved to submit the proposal regarding reducing school holidays and shortening the academic year to the Executive Yuan for discussion and reply. This case has great implications for our country's education system and the future of young people, and people in the education field across the country are paying close attention to it. The proposed methods in the case and the results after implementation must be studied in a concrete and detailed manner. Based on the experience of general educators, they already feel that the current curriculum is complex, and students may have difficulty coping with it. Students with better grades are also physically weaker. The purpose of education is to achieve a balanced development of moral, intellectual, and physical education, especially during youth, and special attention should be paid to cultivation and training to enrich the foundation of youth's life. In my opinion, improving our country's education system should focus on enriching the content of subjects, especially paying attention to practical courses, and reducing unnecessary ones to achieve practical results. Currently, students and teachers have too few opportunities for contact outside of class. In the future, teachers and students should have close cooperation. Furthermore, students often feel unable to adapt to the social environment and their lives after leaving school. We should also pay attention to how to connect schools with society.

<h3>Prospects of Anglo-French Negotiations · English</h3>
<p>Since the Franco-Italian Entente in Rome, observers have long anticipated that the development of the European situation would resemble spring clouds emerging from the mountains, with overlapping waves. As expected, the Saar issue was resolved following the Rome Entente. The authorities of Britain and France, who control the center of European politics, exchanged individual opinions in Geneva and then decided to hold bilateral negotiations in London at the end of the month. It seems that Flandin and Laval's journey westward across the sea will be nothing more than discussing the main European issues in order to seek further development of the European situation. Reuters' London dispatch on the 19th, which stated that the consultation of pending European cases will begin from this, is indeed a concise statement.</p>
<p>Given the current turmoil in Europe, what is most likely to cause anxiety among the British is Germany's desire to liberate itself from the shackles of the Treaty of Versailles, a fact known to the world. The so-called main European issues are probably nothing more than how to enable Germany to gain considerable advantages under the Franco-German coordination principle. If this goal can be achieved, it will alleviate the deterioration of Franco-German relations and raise the flag of German eastward expansion. Britain, for the sake of continental European diplomacy, does have a policy that can be considered a perfect plan. If not, why would the Little Entente and the Balkan groups already be whispering in doubt about it before the ink of the Rome Entente had dried? And why would the Memel issue have already shifted to the center of German attention before the London negotiations had even begun? All of this is enough to prove the success of British diplomacy. Furthermore, observing that Laval attaches great importance to the future of the Eastern European Pact before arriving in London, one can already see his posture of drawing his bow.</p>
<p>We have always argued that the core of Germany's current foreign policy is nothing more than to achieve liberation from military and political constraints by abolishing the Treaty of Versailles. However, since France has actively constructed an anti-German encirclement in recent years, Germany's situation has become increasingly difficult. Its compromising with Poland, submitting to Italy, and recently recognizing the demilitarization of the Saar region all have hidden reasons. Its compromises are all in an attempt to achieve the final goal: to get rid of the Treaty of Versailles. Therefore, it is known that the future transformation of Franco-German relations depends on the pulling power of the British. The opportunity for peaceful development also depends entirely on the future Anglo-French negotiations.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the safety of Eastern and Central European countries is extremely important in today's European issues. Therefore, since the Rome Entente, although the Little Entente has been recognized as needing to join the entente to ensure Austrian independence, the Little Entente has stated that unless Germany and Poland join the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact, France must conclude a cooperation treaty with Russia. This expression of unity between Central and Southeastern Europe is nothing less than a warning to France before going to Britain. Furthermore, judging from Litvinov's re-mention on the 19th of this month of the statement of non-conclusion of ententes by Russia and France on December 5th of last year, it is also known that France's purpose in going to Britain this time will not only involve the status of the Little Entente and the Balkan countries, but may also affect the future of the international status of Eastern European countries such as Lithuania. In short, the extent to which Germany, relying on British mediation, can reach a compromise is contingent upon taking something in return for it not being effective in European issues. European issues are complex and involve many factors. Even this one issue, to what extent can it satisfy Germany? Under the condition that France allows the Eastern European Pact to proceed without concluding any ententes, how will it answer Britain? This is also one of the most noteworthy things.</p>
<h3>U.S. Silver Production Greatly Reduced</h3>
<p>Will Continue to Buy From Abroad</p>
<p>(Washington) According to statistics released by the Department of Commerce today, U.S. silver production is declining. The claim that the United States will be forced to purchase sufficient silver currency from foreign markets once the mandatory silver purchase plan is passed seems to have been confirmed. The statistics released by the Department of Commerce are as follows: U.S. silver production decreased significantly in the period from June to November 1934. The domestic silver production in June was 2,312,000 ounces, and the silver purchase policy was implemented in that month. In November, U.S. silver production was only 1,976,000 ounces. At the same time, world silver production in June was 14,871,000 ounces, and in November it increased to 15,308,000 ounces. (National dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Participation in World Court Expected to Pass Senate</h3>
<p>(Washington) Government spokesmen in the Senate predicted today that if the issue of U.S. participation in the World Court is put to a vote, the Senate will pass it. Although Senators Borah and Johnson have been trying to oppose it, the government faction still claims that it will definitely pass. However, in order to avoid being criticized in the future for forcing the Senate to pass such an important international proposal, the government has decided to give the opposition full opportunity to express their opinions. It is learned that the Senate leaders plan to extend the debate time indefinitely. They probably have a firm grasp of passing it, as the President indicated in his special message, so they do not want to rush it. Moreover, the various committees happen to need to discuss other important bills mentioned by the government, and the chamber is inevitably deserted, so the debate on the World Court case is not necessarily a good opportunity to pass the time.

<h3>Japanese Political War Begins</h3>
<p>The 67th Session of Parliament Reopens Today</p>
<p>Okada and Hirota Will Deliver Speeches</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Diet is scheduled to reopen tomorrow. First, Prime Minister Okada will deliver a speech on administrative policy, followed by Finance Minister Takahashi's financial speech, and then Foreign Minister Hirota will deliver a speech on foreign policy. In tomorrow's government speeches, Foreign Minister Hirota's speech is most noteworthy. According to political circles, the speech will contain a major statement on China policy. (Hualian dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The 67th Diet will reopen at 10:00 AM on the 22nd. After Prime Minister Okada delivers a speech on administrative policy and Foreign Minister Hirota delivers a speech on foreign policy, representatives of political parties will begin questioning. The House of Peers decided on the questioners at noon today as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Sakamoto Toshinari will question the fuel nationalization case problem. (2) Kato Masayuki will question the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance on financial and economic issues. (3) Minobe Tatsukichi will question the Minister of Justice on the supervisory incident regarding prosecutorial affairs. (Rengo dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Okada visited former Prime Minister Saito, who was resting at his Isshiki villa in Hayama, yesterday afternoon for about thirty minutes. He left at 4:55 PM. During the meeting between the two, Prime Minister Okada explained in detail the various issues of reform of institutions in Manchuria, budget formulation, establishment of a cabinet review council, and meetings with the three party leaders. Regarding the establishment of the cabinet review council, he said that for the purpose of establishing various fundamental national policies, it is considered that a review council should be established with a nationwide lineup beyond political parties and factions to cope with the situation. He requested understanding and assistance on this point, implicitly expressing a request for Saito's participation. Next, regarding the government's policy towards the Diet, he made clear his determination, saying that the government will definitely avoid dissolution and stabilize the political situation, but depending on the measures taken by the Seiyukai, he does not hesitate to fight. Saito expressed his understanding of this and said that he would do his best to assist. Saito, the mother of the current cabinet, and Prime Minister Okada's meeting is particularly noteworthy before the reopening of the unsettled Diet. After the meeting, Prime Minister Okada told reporters, "I asked former Prime Minister Saito about the miscellaneous talk, explaining the meetings with the three party leaders, the establishment of the Cabinet Review Council, the Rice Investigation Committee, and the Wen Zheng Review Council. Regarding the Cabinet Review Council, I explained the purpose of its establishment, and plan to submit the budget to this session of the Diet. Saito said, "This is very good, it will definitely be accomplished." Regarding the meetings with the three party leaders, he only mentioned that the atmosphere was peaceful and did not mention the results. The matter of additional budgets was not mentioned either, but Saito said, "All parties do not hope for dissolution." In short, Saito encouraged me a lot today. (Dentsu dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<h3>Political Party Questioning Lineup</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The House of Representatives will hold a plenary session at 1:00 PM on February 12th.

Seiyukai's Shimada Toshio will question general administrative issues, Okuchi Kiroku will question financial issues, and Yamaguchi Senichi will question discipline issues. Minseito's Sakurauchi Yukio will question general administrative issues. (Rengo dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<h3>Division of Factions in Both Houses</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a survey on the 21st, the division of power among the factions in the upper and lower houses is as follows:</p>
<p>"House of Peers" Imperial Family 18, Kenkyukai 158, Doseikai 23, Koseikai 67, Koyu Club 37, Dowakai 35, Kayokai 41, Independents 32, Vacancies 11.</p>
<p>"House of Representatives" Seiyukai 262, Minseito 116, Kokudo 31, Daiichi Shitei 25, Independents 2, Vacancies 30, Total 436. (Rengo dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<h3>Seiyukai Issues Declaration</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Seiyukai held a party convention today and resolved the following declaration: Half a year has passed since the current cabinet was formed, but because it ignores the party's domestic and foreign policies and falsely advocates national unity, it has not seen any political achievements. If the current cabinet intends to govern the country, it must listen to the party's policies. At this time of national hardship, the government's incompetence is truly worrying for the country. We will continue to monitor the government with a solemn attitude in order to fulfill the responsibility of the party. In addition, President Suzuki also stated in today's convention that the government's responsibility lies in seeking national stability and industrial prosperity, but the current cabinet has failed to maintain the harmony and balance of these two items and has neglected the development of industry. Therefore, our party requested the government to submit supplementary budgets at the extraordinary session of parliament and demanded that it effectively relieve the disaster-stricken farmers, industrialists, and merchants. However, the government has not implemented concrete policies and only knows how to advocate national unity and bear the difficult situation, but does not know how to achieve substantive national unity and ignores the political parties. This is because the current cabinet is a bureaucratic cabinet. (Hualian dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At 2:00 PM today, the Seiyukai held a regular convention at its headquarters. President Suzuki and 500 members, including general affairs, advisors, secretaries, and members of both houses of parliament, attended. After reporting on party affairs, passing declarations and resolutions, and electing standing members, Secretary-General Wakamiya and President Suzuki delivered speeches, and the meeting adjourned at 3:30 PM. At 4:00 PM, the attendees were invited to a banquet at the Sanrokutei. The main points of Secretary-General Wakamiya's speech are as follows:</p>
<p>Bureaucrats who are alienated from the people do not understand the actual situation of the people, so the only way to express public opinion is through political parties that represent the people, and it is difficult for an unorganized crowd to achieve substantive national unity. Bureaucrats despise political parties and call for national unity in order to maintain power, which is a great hindrance to the expression of public opinion. The Seiyukai, with its absolute majority, is based on public opinion and unites to take charge of affairs. Who can hinder it? We will strive to return to the normal path of constitutional government, based on sincerity, and exert the power of the party to live up to the expectations of the people.</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At 2:00 PM today, during the regular convention held by the Seiyukai at its headquarters, the main points of President Suzuki's speech are as follows: The major national issues under the sun are, first, to complete the guidance of "Manchukuo" in order to ensure peace in the Far East; second, to uphold Japan's just claims and maintain harmony with other countries at the naval disarmament conference; and third, to develop commerce and trade through sound economic diplomacy. Since these three major issues are all international issues, how they are handled is related to the progress of the national destiny. Therefore, the people must face them with extraordinary determination. At this critical time, Japan, standing at the crossroads of the rise and fall of national fortunes, must, on the one hand, strengthen national defense and ensure national security, and on the other hand, promote industry and realize the stability of the people's lives, and proceed with a vigorous and healthy national step, but first, it must complete the industrial standing army. However, the current cabinet does not have a full understanding and recognition of this. The current cabinet's several manifestos, such as rectifying discipline, establishing public sentiment, reforming education, and improving administration, have not been realized, but have instead gone against their commitments to the people. In this session of parliament, I hope that you will not act emotionally, but stand in a position of worrying about the country with sincerity, fully fulfill the responsibility of deliberating national policies, and exert the function of parliamentary politics to deepen the people's trust in parliament. (Dentsu dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<h3>Minseito Supports the Government</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Minseito considers that its strategy in this session of parliament is sufficient to determine the rise and fall of the party, so it continues to carefully consider countermeasures. Although there may be no risk of dissolution in this session of parliament, it is difficult to guarantee that unexpected events will not occur during the two months due to the aftermath of the bomb motion. Therefore, its countermeasures must be prepared early. The party's attitude towards the government has never been one of supporting or opposing everything. Recently, it has changed to active guidance and encouragement, giving full support to the government's policies and assuming responsibility at the same time. It also plans to strive to realize the party's own policies and claims through the efforts of the current government, while abandoning the friendly relationship with the Seiyukai and upholding a great cause that can be approved by the people to confront the Seiyukai.

<h3>Balkan Entente Countries Participate in Franco-Italian Protocol</h3>
<p>And Hope for Consideration of Supplementary Agreements</p>
<p>To Solve Central and Southern European Problems</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Balkan Entente countries issued a communique today announcing their decision to participate in the Franco-Italian Protocol recently established in Rome, and stated that the Balkan countries recognize that the principles of the Rome Protocol are very beneficial to international relations. It is found that when Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and French Foreign Minister Laval discussed the entente, they originally paid attention to the accession of the Little Entente countries, so that it could unite the military force of 1.5 million people to implement the resolutions of the signatory countries. The participation of the Balkan countries is a further step in the realization of a dictatorial system in Europe for peace instead of a disarmament policy. (National dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) After the representatives of the four countries of the Balkan Entente, Greece, Turkey, Romania, and Yugoslavia, held a meeting here, they issued a communique as follows: "After discussing various issues directly related to the four countries, the representatives of the four countries of the Balkan Entente immediately exchanged views on the general international situation, such as the international situation arising from the recent Franco-Italian negotiations and the establishment of the Rome Protocol. The four countries of the Balkan Entente agreed and recognized that this measure is extremely important, and the various principles stipulated in the Rome Protocol are extremely beneficial. The four countries of the Balkan Entente are very pleased with this national undertaking for organizing peace, and hope that this measure can take into account and consolidate the status of the countries related to the peace of Central and Eastern Europe in order to perfect it and achieve practical results. The representatives of the four countries of the Balkan Entente hereby unanimously declare that their opinions are completely the same on the current issues. The four governments have taken joint action in the past and achieved satisfactory results, and will have a stronger will to continue to take joint action in the future to seek solutions to the current issues."

<h3>法外長之談話</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Yesterday, French Foreign Minister Laval spoke with the Geneva correspondent of the Soviet government's newspaper Izvestia, stating that nothing could make France abandon its goal of establishing guarantees for all nations to achieve universal harmony. Laval also said that France's policy is extremely clear, of great importance, and serves peace without seeking private gain. The French Foreign Minister further stated that the Northeast European Pact is closer to being resolved due to the Soviet Union's decision to join the League of Nations, and that Litvinov and he personally have concluded a formal agreement in Geneva, with both sides expressing their determination to promote this agreement. Laval added that the world has reached a point where any nation still harboring aggressive ambitions will soon learn that it is at odds with the global community that supports peace. He and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini reached a complete understanding of this concept during their negotiations in Rome. Therefore, the extent to which the Northeast Pact succeeds will indicate whether the full realization of this concept is possible. Finally, Laval pointed out that universal security depends on the willingness of widespread cooperation, and therefore, in addition to the agreements already drafted, France will do its utmost to support any country that can propose suggestions that would enhance common security. (20th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) French Foreign Minister Laval gave a speech to an Izvestia reporter, in which he said, "The policy of the French government is clear, appropriate, and resolute. Now that the Saar issue has been finally resolved and the development of the European situation has entered an important stage, I must declare the above point to the League of Nations, because France's policy is peaceful, impartial, and aims to seek the security of all countries and to guarantee general security. This policy is resolutely unwavering. The calls for peace are increasing. At this opportune moment, these calls should be turned into reality. The proposals are already drafted. If they are passed, those who deliberately disrupt peace will have nowhere to go. Governments that receive such proposals must take responsibility for them. Last year, a great nation joined the League of Nations, and that country has specifically expressed its desire for cooperation in seeking peace. The Soviet government's decision has made the Eastern Pact possible. All points of this pact have been studied by the countries concerned for several months, and now we can declare that any country that wants to invade another country will be opposed by a united front of peace-loving countries. Litvinov and I have used formal documents to express this determination to achieve strength. Even if we are disappointed, we will continue to strive to improve the guarantees of peace in an effective manner. I am deeply convinced of this point, because peace is about patience, courage, and will. Litvinov once said that peace is indivisible. This is the best explanation of our views. We will rely on the realization of the Eastern Pact to diagnose the possibility of realizing these views. I and Mussolini have reached complete agreement on this view. Universal security must rely on the universal will for peace to be achieved. Partial success can also eliminate worrying factors, which no one can guarantee they will be able to avoid on their own. However, in addition to this plan (which began to be studied last year and which we must implement this year), if there are other plans that can enhance the security of other parts of Europe, the French government will be able to fully support them," he said. (20th TASS dispatch)</p>
<h3>羅外長之談話</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu told a reporter from Izvestia, "I consider the resumption of diplomatic relations between Romania and the Soviet Union to be one of the most important events in my political career. Not only do geographical and historical relations demand close friendship between our two countries, but also the ideas of our two countries' leaders regarding the building of peace are extremely close, so the two countries can work together in international life. Litvinov's personality was admired by us long before the resumption of diplomatic relations between the two countries. His contribution to international cooperation is most valuable. As for the definition of aggressor countries, if accepted by all countries, war will be more difficult to break out, because this definition will make those who declare war bear undeniable responsibility. Romania is very concerned about the negotiations currently underway in various parts of Europe. Romania's geographical position can explain why Romania hopes that the negotiations for the conclusion of the Eastern Pact can be completed as soon as possible. We regard the Rome Agreement as the foundation for cooperation in the Danube River basin. In addition to considering the obligations borne by several small Entente countries and Balkan Entente countries, Romania will participate in this agreement with all sincerity. The cornerstone of our country's foreign policy lies in the small Entente countries and the Balkan Entente countries, as well as our country's alliance with France, and the friendship between the Soviet Union and Romania and between France and the Soviet Union can make these alliances function normally. The purpose of the above alliance is by no means to attack others. On the contrary, this alliance is the highest guarantee of peace in Eastern Europe. From this, we can see that I highly value the development of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Romania, because I know how important the Soviet Union views its diplomatic relations with France," he said. (20th TASS dispatch)</p>
<h3>法報之樂觀</h3>
<p>(Paris) As a result of French Foreign Minister Laval's negotiations in Geneva, Mr. Bodinat, the political reporter for L'Echo de Paris, has now abandoned his pessimistic attitude and joined in a chorus of praise. In Sunday's L'Echo de Paris, Bodinat stated that Laval's actions in Geneva were a turning point in French foreign policy and had returned it to the proper path from which it should not have deviated. According to today's reports in various newspapers, Laval has informed Polish Foreign Minister Beck that if Poland insists on not participating in the Eastern European Pact, France will conclude a separate agreement with the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, leaving Poland out. It is said that Laval's tone was quite serious, and the Polish government was quite shocked by this, because if France were to conclude a treaty with Russia and Czechoslovakia, Poland would be in a completely isolated position. Not only would the Franco-Polish alliance be shaken, but also the Polish-Romanian alliance would also be affected. Le Journal de Paris said that, looking at the negotiations conducted in Geneva in recent days, although it cannot be said that the actions of the League of Nations and other countries were caused by fear of Germany, Germany has indeed made the countries gathered in Geneva suspicious. Therefore, Germany's return to their ranks must be handled with caution. (20th National Dispatch)</p>
<h3>俄報之評論</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Izvestia published an article entitled "United Front for the Struggle for Peace," claiming that the speeches of Litvinov, Laval, and Titulescu all demonstrated the common determination of the Soviet Union, France, the Little Entente, and the Balkan Entente to continue their united front and strive for general peace, especially for peace in Eastern Europe, and to realize the Eastern Regional Pact. These speeches were published after the end of the Rome Agreement and the Saar plebiscite, so they are of great political significance. Some newspapers in the world have said that the Rome Agreement is the beginning of the four major powers of Western Europe's willingness to have a policy of settling and peace in Western Europe (only for Western Europe). Some of the European bourgeoisie are very happy about the results of the Saar plebiscite, seeing this as an obstacle to the peaceful relationship between France and Germany, and at the same time, it can increase the Western European countries' sincerity in facing Germany's imperialist expansion plan.</p>
<p>The purpose of this interpretation is to break and weaken the line fighting for world peace, but the statements of the three gentlemen, Li, Laval, and Titulescu, have shattered this kind of interpretation. Although peace in Western Europe has been consolidated, peace in Eastern Europe has not been enhanced, then its result must be to guide the tendency of war to Eastern Europe, but if there is war in Eastern Europe, it will inevitably involve Western Europe as a concern.</p>
<p>Laval's statement can be called an important document. He expressed that he himself and his government are willing to resolutely strive for the conclusion of the Eastern Pact and regard this plan as a touchstone for the peaceful inclinations of other countries. Titulescu, Czech Foreign Minister Benes, and Turkish Foreign Minister Rushdi have made great contributions to the promotion of peace in Eastern and Southern Europe. Titulescu stated with all his strength that he is in complete agreement with the Soviet-French peace policy. Titulescu's words were not limited to Titulescu's personal opinion. It should be known that the Czech Republic, Yugoslavia, Turkey, and Greece all agree with Titulescu. Therefore, Laval's statement on behalf of France has been fully supported by the Little Entente and the Balkan Entente.</p>
<p>Litvinov was able to firmly believe that the countries concerned about the peace organizations and peace guarantees of the European countries will not only continue to cooperate, but this cooperation will be realized with greater strength, speed, and awareness. Litvinov frankly said to Germany that the success or failure of the Eastern European Pact depends only on Germany, and that the opportunity for its realization has indeed greatly increased. It is precisely because the steps and suggestions taken by Soviet diplomacy are beneficial to world peace and are also welcomed by the German people that Litvinov can make such a public statement to Germany.</p>
<p>The newspaper also stated that the representatives of the Little Entente and the Balkan Entente often said that Litvinov's respect and honesty in implementing the Soviet government's policies moved them. Litvinov himself said that when he left Geneva, he was even more convinced of the politicians with whom he had discussed the necessary steps to consolidate European peace, etc. Izvestia then stated that the basis of this mutual trust is the common struggle for peace. The policy of preparing for aggression is to destroy the confidence of all countries and thereby alienate them. The policy of peace is the opposite. Although the political and social opinions of all countries are different, this policy seeks to unite them and trust each other. The greater the efforts of the countries participating in the united front for peace to strive for security, the stronger the mutual trust of the representatives of each country.</p>
<p>However, efforts for peace cannot only rely on the efforts of politicians, and it is also necessary to make the people of all countries increasingly friendly, and the public can often provide assistance. The public does not believe in words, but in facts. We deeply hope that the diplomatic actions of all countries concerned with maintaining and promoting peace can truly conform to their words of trust. These statements are all the result of the Geneva negotiations, and their hope for preserving peace in the whole of Europe will surely be strengthened and will surely be satisfied by Soviet public opinion.

<h3>奧國復辟聲</h3>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister Publicly Declares</p>
<p>However, Monarchists Still Deny</p>
<p>Vienna The Austrian restoration movement has taken a further step, as Deputy Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief of the Home Guard Prince Starhemberg delivered a speech to the captains of the Home Guard, saying that he felt that the monarchy was necessary for Austria and the linchpin of European peace. It is said that Starhemberg's attitude towards the monarchy movement has always been ambiguous, and now he is formally recognizing it, which can be regarded as a great step forward in the restoration. However, Starhemberg still warned the monarchists not to act too hastily, and said that the Home Guard should decide when Archduke Otto would ascend the throne. According to well-informed observers, after the restoration of Austria, the European situation will change greatly, because the opinions of various countries on this matter are divided. The opposing parties include the Little Entente countries, especially Yugoslavia and the Czech Republic. It is said that France will not oppose it, because after the restoration, there is no need to worry about the merger of Germany and Austria. As far as Austria itself is concerned, the only question is how to avoid offending Yugoslavia and the Czech Republic. Another method is gradualism, first having Archduke Otto serve as head of state as a transition, but not using the title of president or regent, and then declaring the monarchy and ascending the throne. (20th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>Vienna The direct cause of the Austrian royal family's restoration movement is believed to be Germany's great victory in the Saar plebiscite. It is reported that officials are quite panicked about the Saar's return to Germany, so they plan to create a restoration to counter the challenge of the National Socialist Party. Leaflets are distributed at night in various places in Vienna, in a form similar to that used by the Socialist Party and the National Socialist Party, campaigning for the election of the Grand Duke as the next president. However, the person they intend to elect is Grand Duke Otto, not Grand Duke Eugene. (20th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Vienna The representative of the monarchists, Baron Wiesner, denied the claim that Archduke Eugene would be elected as the next Austrian president, calling it a pure slander, and said that the one who spread this rumor of the Austrian royal family's restoration was the German ambassador to Austria, Papen, who wanted to fabricate rumors to show that Austria was a danger to European peace. However, Austrian Deputy Prime Minister Starhemberg told 2,000 junior officers of the Home Guard that the restoration of the Habsburg royal family could bring peace to Central Europe, and that when this issue matures, it will be resolved by the Home Guard, not the legislature.

<h3>德國砲位轉向</h3>
<p>Memel Becomes Target</p>
<p>(London) Since the Saar region plebiscite, the Pan-Germanic movement has shown a tendency to bloom. Therefore, most British newspapers have issued warnings. The Daily Express said, "The European artillery position is now changing its direction. The one that used to be aimed at the Saar is now aimed at Memel. Germany's propaganda must be paid attention to urgently." The Labour Party's Daily Herald said, "After the success of the Saar plebiscite, Germany's so-called plebiscite has become a fashionable thing everywhere and wants to be used everywhere, but in fact this kind of propaganda is nothing more than a kind of material used in internal affairs to comfort people's hearts."

<p>University Fund Committee Publishes Report</p>
<p>Chicago The University of Chicago's Harris Foundation today released a survey report recommending that the United States abandon its extraterritorial rights in China and the Philippines, Samoa, and Guam. According to their opinion, the United States' Far East territories are a major military weakness. The United States' Far East enemies can use them as hostages. If the United States does not have these territories, it can adopt economic weapons when necessary. As for preserving China's territorial integrity, it should be based on the Kellogg Pact and cancel the current Far East consultation methods. The report advocates completely abandoning extraterritorial rights in China and amending U.S. immigration laws as a sign of friendship with Japan. (20th National Dispatch)</p>

In the Battle of the Marne, he served as the commander of an infantry battalion and worked with General Joffre day and night. After this battle, he entered the General Staff and then commanded the famous Daredevil Team and went to the front again. In 1917, he was promoted to Major General and became the Chief of Staff of General Macler. Before the end of the war, he was promoted to the commander of the Ninth Division. After the war, he led the French military investigation team to Brazil. He did not return until 1925, when he served as the commander of the army and was sent to Syria to succeed General Sarraut. In 1929, he served as the commander of the 20th Army Corps in Nancy. When Weygand took over as Army Commander in 1931, the general succeeded him as Chief of Staff and received many medals.

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>The Hesheng Foreign Firm in New York reported on the 21st that the favorable factors for the market before the opening of securities trading were that steel industry reports stated that the copper plants' production last week accounted for approximately 51% of their capacity, an increase of 5.6% from the previous week. The steel plants in the Youngstown area were operating at approximately 64% of their capacity this week, indicating an expansion in steel demand. The unfavorable factor for the market was the lack of leadership in the securities market. Before the Gold Clause case is decided, there is still a wait-and-see attitude. The securities market opened this morning with a firm market, but the gains were limited to fractions.</p>
<p>According to Reuters, the focus of Wall Street this morning was on the possibility of a hypothetical ruling on the Gold Clause issue. The case is still under discussion by the Supreme Court, causing operators to adopt a wait-and-see attitude, resulting in sluggish trading. Steel industry news is certainly welcome, but commentators believe that if railways and construction industries do not immediately become consumers of steel, their upward trend will be greatly hindered. Steel stocks have now risen. U.S. Steel preferred stock opened this morning, rising one pound. General business news remains good, but although sentiment has improved, trading may not increase immediately. At the very least, it must wait for the Gold Clause issue to be resolved. The New York securities market prices are listed below:</p>

After dinner, they attended a concert held by the Music Promotion Committee of the Department of Education. They returned to the guest house to rest at about nine o'clock. The speech given by Provincial Committee Member Lu at the banquet and a general overview of land reform in the province are attached below.</p>
<h3>Mr. Lu's Speech</h3>
<p>"Gentlemen, thank you for braving the hardships to visit Jiangxi. We are very happy to meet with you all. Jiangxi has suffered from banditry for many years, and it has only recently been quelled. All aspects of politics and the economy, especially rural construction, are certainly not yet sound. We hope that you will provide guidance. Chairman Xiong is in Beijing on official business and is unable to attend to welcome you, for which we apologize. I am here to represent Chairman Xiong and my fellow committee members to offer you a toast, to express our welcome and wish you good health."</p>
<h3>Director Gu's Original Speech</h3>
<p>Director Gu's welcoming speech at the tea party to entertain the international press corps at the military headquarters at half past four on the afternoon of the 19th, was as follows: "Distinguished members of the international press corps, you have braved the hardships of this cold winter to travel a long distance to Jiangxi and make a long journey to the newly recovered bandit areas to conduct on-the-ground investigations into the destruction caused by the former Red bandits in Jiangxi and the current efforts to rebuild and rehabilitate the area. In the future, you will introduce this to the international community, so that people around the world can understand. I welcome this very much and consider it a great honor. Recalling the scourge of the Red bandits in Jiangxi, from the Nanchang Uprising on August 1, 1927, to the recapture of Ruijin, the location of the pseudo-Soviet central government, in November 1934, lasted a full seven years. Fifty-one of the eighty-one counties in Jiangxi Province fell into the bandit areas one after another. The direct slaughter of people totaled nearly one million, and the loss to the national economy reached more than 150 million yuan. This kind of tragedy is an unprecedented catastrophe in Jiangxi in recent centuries. The Red bandits are different from the bandits mentioned in ancient Chinese history. They are directed by the Third International, have an international background, and have a strict organization. Their conspiracy is to use Jiangxi Province as a base to 'redden' all of China, and the second step is to use China as a base to 'redden' the whole world. Their members are very complex, mostly consisting of outdated and dismissed soldiers, and local thugs. On the surface, they use communist fallacies to deceive the people, numb the youth, instigate class struggle, and use threats and inducements in every possible way. In reality, they are entirely a bandit group of arson, murder, rape, and plunder, which is not only a disaster for the Chinese nation, but also a pest for the world's human race. Our central government, in order to seek the independent survival of the Chinese nation, maintain peace in East Asia, and ensure the stability of the entire world, made a great determination to suppress the Red bandits, sparing no sacrifice and concentrating all efforts to engage in this task. In the past few years, repeated campaigns were launched, and they were about to be wiped out, but they were unable to achieve their due success due to other obstructions. Until the autumn of 1933, the fifth encirclement and suppression campaign began. The supreme military leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, was stationed in Jiangxi, advancing both militarily and politically. In military terms, he trained cadres, changed tactics, built bunkers, and built roads, so that the bandit army's past elusive attacks were rendered ineffective. In political terms, he clarified officialdom, handled the baojia system, trained the people, rewarded self-renewal, recruited refugees, and implemented an economic blockade. Since the implementation of these strategies, the bandits lacked materials, and the internal situation gradually collapsed. The National Army then used the greatest sacrifice and effort to eliminate most of them, and recaptured the old nest of the pseudo-capital, Ruijin. The remnant bandits fled in panic to the west. The central government has now formulated a comprehensive plan, and will soon be able to fundamentally annihilate them. Now that the entire Jiangxi Province has been recovered, the urgent tasks are to clear out the scattered bandits, handle the aftermath, and actively rebuild to seek restoration and prosperity. At the same time, we are vigorously implementing the New Life Movement advocated by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to seek spiritual construction, because the New Life Movement focuses on propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame, restoring China's inherent morality, which is especially targeted at the general masses and youth of Jiangxi Province who have forgotten their motherland after being 'reddened' by the bandits for many years. Therefore, since its implementation, great results have been achieved. From then on, both spiritual and material aspects will advance simultaneously to save Jiangxi, and to lay the foundation for the revival of the Chinese nation. We hope that friendly people who sympathize with us will add their support. During this inspection, the routes you have taken, such as Fuzhou, Nancheng, Lichuan, Ningdu, and other places, although there are highways and automobiles available for transportation, due to the fact that these areas have been bandit areas in the past and have not been recovered for long, all materials are lacking. The reception along the way may not be adequate, and the food and lodging may not be comfortable. I hope you will forgive us. In addition, regarding the various aspects of post-war construction, I hope that you will carefully observe and provide detailed guidance."</p>
<h3>General Overview of Land Reform in Jiangxi Province</h3>
<p>(1) Aerial Surveying: First, an aerial camera is used to photograph the shape of the fields on a film with a scale of 1:7500. Then, based on control points, the photos are corrected, and the scale is enlarged to 1:2500. Then, a collodion plate is used to re-photograph to 1:1000, and blueprints are printed. Then, staff are dispatched to the field to verify the field boundaries, land categories, and place names, and to supplement the measurement of areas obscured by forests one by one, and to draw the original field map. The aerial survey started in August 1932 and ended at the end of January 1935. 8,615 original field maps of Nanchang County were taken. Currently, aerial surveys are continuing in ten counties including Xinjian, and it is expected to be completed in two years. (2) Land Survey: Divided into three types. The first is boundary survey. According to the aerial survey field analysis map, the county boundaries and district boundaries are surveyed and determined within the original county area, and the bao boundaries are divided. The second is field survey. The location names of each field, as well as the names and addresses of the owners, and the latest land prices, are all investigated and verified one by one, and recorded in the field survey book. The third is land price survey. According to the surveyed land prices and the actual situation, the locations with approximately the same conditions are selected and divided into land price zones, and standard land prices are determined. (3) Land Price Estimation: After the land price has been determined, the owners publicly elect three representatives to participate in the Land Price Estimation Committee to re-determine the price, and a land price zoning map is made and distributed separately. After the specified period has passed, if no objection is raised, it is the estimated land price. The land prices in each district of Nanchang County have been determined and announced in stages. The standard land price per mu of paddy field that has been determined is a maximum of 40 yuan and a minimum of 25 yuan, with the most common price being around 35 yuan. (4) Compilation of Maps and Registers: Based on the original field map after investigation, the area of each field is calculated one by one using a planimeter, and an area calculation book is compiled. In addition, various area and land price statistics tables are made according to the district and bao. Then, the field map is transferred and printed according to the original field map, so that it can be issued to the owners during registration, and general maps and county and district maps are compiled for reference. In addition, according to the field survey book and the area calculation book, the estimated land price of each field is used to compile a land register and a land tax household register. As for the difference in the content of the register, the land register is a field register, which records the field number, land category, area, land price, and owner's name and address of each field, etc., and a field map is attached for comparison. The land tax household register is a household register, which records the area, land price, and annual land tax payable of all fields owned by each owner. (5) Land Registration: Land registration is carried out in areas where all the business of surveying, investigation, area calculation, map making, and register making has been completed, and a land management certificate is issued, with a field map attached, and handed over to the owner for safekeeping. In the future, the certificate will be used as the basis for buying, selling, and transferring. Land registration in Nanchang County has already started. (6) Implementation of Land Tax: In counties where land reform has been completed, the Dingmi tax will be abolished, and the land value tax will be implemented according to the estimated land value, and the previous collection procedures will be improved and re-stipulated to prevent abuses. The process of adopting aerial surveying and trying out Nanchang County has been briefly reported. I will briefly explain the overall land reform plan of the province. In the future, the land reform of the province will be carried out in three phases. The first phase will be carried out in ten counties including Xinjian. The second phase will be carried out in thirty counties including Chongren. The third phase will be carried out in forty counties including Yihuang. From May 1934 to April 1942, the farmland reform of the province will be completed, with a total of eight years. The required funds are budgeted at more than 10,460,000 yuan, with an average reform fee of about 0.32 yuan per mu. (Central News Agency, January 19)</p>
<h3>Investigation of Kala-azar in Northern Jiangsu (2)</h3>
<p>Initial symptoms resemble malaria, followed by hardening of the spleen</p>
<p>Death from secondary diseases is inevitable within a maximum of three years</p>
<p>—Five phenomena of kala-azar that are ignored—</p>
<p>Qingjiangpu Correspondence: The occurrence of kala-azar in northern Jiangsu, the distribution of the disease area, and the statistics of patients have been reported in detail in the previous letter. Now, I will continue to describe the symptoms, pathology, diagnosis, and treatment.</p>
<p>Symptoms: The incubation period of kala-azar is not very short, and the exact period is difficult to determine. When the symptoms first appear, the whole body has chills and fever, like malaria, but the cycle is not regular. After about ten days, the chills and fever subside. At this time, the spleen has hardened, but the mass is still small and not easy to detect. After half a month or several months, chills and fever occur again, and at the same time, the spleen mass increases and can be touched. The phenomena that occur successively are abdominal pain, weight loss, anemia, swelling of the limbs, night sweats, ulceration of the gums, nosebleeds, decreased appetite, diarrhea, blood in the stool, sore throat, and spiritual decline. The patient's condition worsens day by day, and eventually dies from secondary diseases, such as pneumonia, noma, and exhaustion. Death occurs as early as six months, and as late as three years. It is rare for those who do not die after more than three years. When the Far Eastern Society of Tropical Medicine held a meeting in Nanjing in the summer of 1934, Dr. Pu Nangu pointed out five phenomena of kala-azar that are ignored: 1. Abdominal pain, 2. Night blindness, 3. Cessation of menstruation, 4. Infertility, and decreased libido. The representatives from various countries who attended the meeting paid great attention to them.</p>
<p>Diagnosis and Treatment: Here, diagnosis and treatment are provided every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 8:00 am to 12:00 pm. When there are many patients, there are always more than 120 people. Even on rainy days, there are 60 or more people. Patients first register in the registration room. If they are new patients, they must go to the outpatient examination room to test their blood and stool, and then be examined and injected. The examination is responsible by the medical director Pu Nangu. Examination and insect research are carried out by technicians Wu Zhengjian and Cai Changlin, and technician Zhang Junhao. The injection is carried out by nurses. The details are described below. (A) Examination: Stool examination is the same as usual and will not be repeated. About four or five cubic centimeters of blood are drawn from new patients and tested for six points: 1. White blood cell count. The normal white blood cell count per unit is 7,000 to 8,000. Patients with kala-azar have as few as 600. Because the kala-azar parasite L.D. body reproduces in the white blood cells and destroys countless white blood cells, patients with kala-azar have very few white blood cells. 2. Hemoglobin test. The hemoglobin of healthy people is always more than 80% of the standard hemoglobin. The hemoglobin of patients with kala-azar is as low as 10%. 3. Globulin precipitation test. If there is precipitation, it means that there is kala-azar. 4. Ant aldehyde test. If it becomes solid, it means that there is kala-azar. 5. Antimony test. If 10% of antimony is added to 90% of serum, and it becomes a tree shape, it means that there is kala-azar. 6. Blood smear examination to see if there are kala-azar parasites and malaria parasites. Patients with kala-azar still undergo blood tests after the injection period expires to see if there are any residual kala-azar parasites L.D. body present. Inpatients are given two additional tests: 1. Red blood cell count, the same as usual. 2. Bleeding rate. (Bleeding Time) If the bleeding time from a needle prick in the ear is within five minutes, it is determined that spleen and liver puncture (Splenio or l'iver puncture) can be performed. The liquid obtained from the puncture is used for research and examination. See section 6 for details. (B) Diagnosis: First, ask about environmental relations and the course of the disease, and then palpate the spleen and liver. If patients with kala-azar have other diseases, they are also examined and given medicines. Finally, the amount of injection to be given on the day is determined. In addition, for each new patient, a black pin is inserted at a certain point on the map. When two black pins are accumulated, they are replaced with a green refreshing pin. Green pins represent two people, blue pins represent three people, yellow pins represent four people, and red pins represent five people. The place with the most red pins is also the village with the most treated patients. (C) Injection: Local doctors in Qingjiangpu always use two kinds of injection agents: Neosuiboan and Neostan. The annual sales of Qingjiangpu Pharmacy have reached more than seven tubes in recent years. Rural doctors often use TartarEmetio injection agent. Among the three injection agents, Neottiboson is the most effective and non-toxic. The kala-azar research team uses Neotib. Research team performing liver puncture</p>
<p>san. The injection agent is a 5% distilled water deep solution, fish light yellow o, under the age of twelve, the first time to play 5% gram of drug agent, (the total weight is 1 gram, the following analogy,) in turn, add 5% to 25% until, no longer increase, a total of two and ten and a half grams, over the age of twelve, the first time to play 10%, in turn, add 10% to 30%, or thirty-five, no longer increase, a total of three or three and ten and a half grams, if there is a reaction in the middle, then reduce the amount as appropriate.</p>
<p>Pathology: Regarding the study of the pathology of kala-azar, it is now beyond doubt that kala-azar originates from an oval protozoan. The protozoan was discovered by two people, I'eishman and Donovan, so it is named LeishmaniaDonovanin Body, abbreviated as L.D. BodyL.D. Body is 2-105 microns long and 1.5-30 microns wide. L.D.Bady grows in human white blood cells and endothelial cells, especially in the spleen and liver. If the spleen or liver juice of a patient with kala-azar is injected into the abdominal tibia of a vole, the vole will also be infected with kala-azar after about a month, and its L.D. Body will be the same as the original. In addition, if rabbit blood ocean (Agar) and salt are used to prepare a culture medium (Culeilre), and the spleen or liver juice of a patient with kala-azar is transferred to it, the results will be very different. L.D. Body is no longer oval, but becomes a flagellate with more flexible movement. The body is 15-25 microns long and 1.5-3.5 microns wide. Its hair is like the body, and the flagellate is mostly in groups of hairs, all facing inward into a chrysanthemum shape. The current problem is not in the pathogenic protozoan, but in how it is transmitted. One theory is that it is directly transmitted through the mouth and nose. The kala-azar research team has collected more than 1,000 smears of the throat and nose tibia of patients, but has not found L.D. Body. Another theory is that it is indirectly transmitted by insects, and the sandfly is the most suspected intermediate host (Ingermediate Host). Dissection of a certain kind of blood-sucking sandfly revealed that the flagellate found in its digestive system is exactly the same as the flagellate obtained from the spleen or liver juice culture of a patient with kala-azar. The kala-azar research team has captured many sandflies in Qingqianpu from June to September. They are currently studying the breeding period of sandflies and the correlation between the disease period of patients. It is hoped that it will soon be able to make a contribution.

<p>Another message, the Jiangbei kala-azar investigation team jointly formed by the Department of Civil Affairs and the Medical and Political College, set off for inspection on the 14th of this month. The five members of the team, Chu Baozhen, Chen Bangxian, Wang Hancai, Xi Quanzhong, and Shi Zhiyuan, arrived in Huai'an on the 15th. The next morning, they visited Commissioner Zhao and County Chief Qi to discuss the investigation methods. In the afternoon, they visited the County Party Headquarters, Renji Hospital, and the kala-azar research team to make contact separately, and examined the condition of patients with kala-azar. It is reported that Lianshui has the most kala-azar in northern Jiangsu. The team plans to go to Lianshui immediately to conduct actual rural investigation work. It is reported that a lot of research data has been collected.</p>
<h3>Staff Delegation Detains Hou Zhi-dan</h3>
<p>For Repeated Loss of Fortresses, Attempting to Flee with Family</p>
<p>Staff Delegation Cables Chiang Requesting Instructions for Disposal</p>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence: At the beginning of the arrival of the Staff Delegation of the Military Commission of the Central Government in Chongqing, it first issued an order to the generals and soldiers of the front line to suppress the bandits. The central government's rewards and punishments are clear. If anyone leaves his post without authorization or retreats in the face of battle, he will be punished according to the military law for suppressing bandits. Recently, Hou Zhi-dan, the deputy commander of the 25th Army, because of the tight military situation on the front line, actually escorted his family to Chongqing and publicly claimed that he was asking Director He of the Staff Delegation for instructions on suppressing bandits. In fact, after investigation by the military headquarters, it was confirmed that he was ineffective in suppressing bandits and fled in the face of battle. More than 400,000 citizens including Liu Zhengyi, Wang Jianfeng, and Li Gang in this area jointly submitted a report to the Staff Delegation, stating that Hou opened the door to invite bandits when the Red bandits fled to Guizhou, allowing them to drive straight in. Recently, when the military situation was tight, he quietly brought his family to Chongqing, which was a serious departure from his duty and affected the suppression of bandits. They specifically requested the Staff Delegation to severely punish him in order to demonstrate the law. According to the report, the Staff Delegation ordered Liu Xiang, the commander-in-chief of bandit suppression, to detain Hou. It has now telegraphed Chairman Chiang for instructions. The process of detaining Hou is recorded as follows. After Hou Zhi-dan escorted his family to Chongqing, he secretly bought airline tickets, intending to fly to Shanghai via Wuhan on the 19th. According to the report of citizens in this city, the military headquarters verified that in order to boost morale and serve as a warning to others, it ordered the commander-in-chief of bandit suppression, Liu Xiang, to detain Hou and send him to the Staff Delegation for punishment. Liu obeyed the order and instructed the adjutant office to act accordingly when Hou came to the headquarters. At 3:00 pm on the 17th, Hou and Huang Jianqing, the director of his Chongqing office, went to the headquarters to visit Liu. The guards at the gate of Dayingmen saluted Hou. After entering the office, they sat for two hours, but Liu did not come out to see them. Finally, someone announced the order to Hou, asking him to go to the Staff Delegation with Huang Jianqing. Hou's face changed when he heard this. After being inspected, he was taken directly to the military headquarters by the staff of the adjutant office of the headquarters to await disposal. For a time, the Daliangzi area was temporarily placed under martial law, and traffic was cut off. As for the twelve soldiers brought by Hou, they were disarmed when the order was announced. Two of them escaped after hearing the news while staying at the Xinhua gate, and the rest were detained in the detention room. The Staff Delegation has telegraphed Nanjing for instructions on how to deal with Hou.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Zhejiang Province Donation Tax Supervision Committee</h3>
<p>Hangzhou News: Since Battalion Commander Wang Cheng took charge of the Department of Finance in Zhejiang, he has planned to reduce the excessive taxes and miscellaneous taxes. This time, Xu Qingfu succeeded him and decided to implement Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will and follow the methods decided by the National Financial Conference to make overall plans and gradually reduce and exempt taxes. The department is now drafting a plan by Secretary Wei Songtang, and the Zhejiang Province Donation Tax Supervision Committee was established on the 9th of this month, and Zhang Shouyong was appointed as the chairman. The following is an excerpt from his declaration: "(Omitted above) Now, at the beginning of the establishment of this committee, there are things that I must report to the elders of the province. The ancient precepts of taking from the people are obvious, and even Western scholars regard the infringement of national economy by taxes as a great precept. The wealth of heaven is only this number, and there must be sufficient tax sources, and then there will be sufficient income. Taxes are what the government relies on for financial use, and it is natural for people to be willing to pay them, while illegal levies should be cut off first, so that the national economy and people's livelihood can be considered together. Reforming the tax system lies in unifying powers and making collection public. If powers are not unified, there will be obstacles, and good laws will not be implemented. If collection is not public, the people's trust will not be established, and it will be difficult to proceed smoothly. The key is that the people bear one point of burden, and the locality receives one point of benefit. The collection personnel come from the fields, and they feel the same about the devastation. As for the masses, they should pay the legal taxes as soon as possible, and they should strictly supervise the illegal demands. (Omitted below)"</p>

<h3>Water Police Captain Captures Smuggler</h3>
<p>Fan Guozhong, the captain of the first team of the first district of the Water Provincial Public Security Brigade, recently patrolled with his team in person due to the rise of bandits in various places during the winter defense period. Yesterday, he seized a smuggler in Huanxiang Town. According to the smuggler, his name is Xia Yueqin, and he lives in Shitu, Fengxian County. He was carrying nine packs of opium. After being captured, it was deemed to be a matter of opium prohibition, and he was sent to the Songjiang County Anti-Smoking Committee for review.</p>

<h3>Businessmen in Various Industries Strive for Electricity Fees</h3>
<p>The Suzhou Electric Power Plant has recently seen its business develop day by day. When replacing the standard total fire meter, it did not send it to the Nanjing Central Verification Institute for verification in advance, resulting in an increase of 30% to 40% in electricity consumption for various factories compared with normal times, which hindered industrial costs. It has telegraphed the Provincial Construction Department to order the Electric Power Plant to re-establish a balanced price. Trade associations such as the velvet industry sent representatives Liu Fuqing and Lu Jizhao to the Suzhou Construction Department and the Central Construction Committee to petition. As a result, the committee ordered the Electric Power Plant to determine the method after verifying the standard meter. Various industries have now decided to reject the Electric Power Plant's meter reading before the standard meter of the Electric Power Plant has been verified. The County Chamber of Commerce is quite concerned about this matter, fearing that it will cause a storm.</p>

<h3>Dispute over Gate and Bridge Construction in Zhonggang Remains Unresolved</h3>
<p>Due to the construction of gates and bridges in Zhonggang, a dispute occurred between the Sangang Township and the Moxi Township in the Ninth District. The case has been suspended for more than a year and has not been resolved. Last winter, the Gate Construction Preparatory Committee submitted separate reports to the County Government Construction Bureau, requesting that both parties be convened for mediation. The County Bureau mediated twice, but to no avail. Recently, more than a dozen representatives of Sangang Township, including Wu Yucheng, Xia Lin, and Wu Shaozhi, said that now is the time for winter water holes and the people are free. If the construction is delayed again, they are afraid that the spring water will rise and they will not be able to start construction. Furthermore, if there is a flood this year, who will be responsible? According to the villagers of Sangang Township, if there is no solution in the future, they will have to start construction independently. If the other party obstructs, they will fight to the death. Fearing that barbaric actions will occur and turn into a bloody tragedy, they submitted another report to County Chief Yan yesterday, requesting that both parties be convened as soon as possible to mediate a solution, so as to appease the villagers and benefit the construction.</p>

<h3>Yishunxiang Cloth Store Closes</h3>
<p>Yishunxiang Cloth Store, located at the entrance of Baota Lane, West Gate Street, has been open for nearly 30 years. In 1933, it suspended business for one year due to the sluggish market. It reorganized and added a record of resumption of business the following year. Only because the social economy was in decline and the people's purchasing power was weak, coupled with the fact that the previous deposits had to be gradually withdrawn, it was unable to continue operating until the 20th. Therefore, the store owner's representative, Zu Xingqing, entrusted lawyer Pu Xilan to apply to the local court for a declaration of liquidation. It is reported that there are about 4,000 yuan in outstanding debts to the local area, and the amount in Shanghai and deposits is also considerable.</p>

<h3>Wife's Death Soon Followed by Daughter's Suicide</h3>
<p>Chen Chaofeng, a resident of Laowei, Jifengzhou, in the third district of Jiangdu, is over forty years old. He had a wife, Wang, a daughter, Aying, and a young son. He supported his family by fishing in a small boat, managing to make a living. Unfortunately, Wang died of illness a month ago. Although Chen lost his spouse, he relied on Aying to cook and care for the children, finding some solace. Unexpectedly, Aying, feeling despondent, often missed her mother and pitied her father, becoming somewhat disoriented in her actions. This led to a quarrel with her father a few days ago, and Aying conceived a desire to end her life. On the night of the 19th, taking advantage of her father's drunken sleep, she threw herself into the water and drifted away with the waves. This morning (the 20th), she was discovered missing, with no trace of her. It is said that Chen, in his grief and anger, also intends to take his son and drown himself in the river. It is indeed a tragic situation.</p>

<h3>Waiting Area Built on the Cao'e Riverbank</h3>
<p>The Cao'e Riverbank in Baiguan is the terminus of the Yongcao Railway and faces the bus station on the Xiaoshaosheng Highway across the river. It is truly an important transportation hub in eastern Zhejiang. The ferry crossing there is crowded with passengers waiting to cross every day, with no suitable place to rest. Jin Tingsun, a gentleman from Ningbo residing in Shanghai, recognizing this need, donated over 5,000 yuan to build a five-room building. The entire upper floor is intended to be a library and reading room, while the lower floor will serve as a waiting area for passengers to sit and rest and store their luggage. Wang Qingsheng, a resident of Baiguan, is planning and implementing this project. Construction will begin soon, with Wen Genji Construction Company as the contractor. It is expected to be completed within the year.</p>

<h3>Sandboat Capsizes, More Than Thirty Drown</h3>
<p>Huang Shucai, Zhu Jingao, Wu Youming, and Shi Youbang, students from Chongming Island attending Xilei Middle School in the county seat, were returning to Chongming Island yesterday (the 18th) afternoon on Fan Qingtai's sandboat. There were more than thirty passengers on board. Unexpectedly, while traveling in the middle of the river, a strong wind suddenly arose, and huge waves surged, causing the boat to capsize instantly. All the passengers were submerged, with no survivors. The loss of other goods is still difficult to estimate. After the Public Security Branch learned of this, it dispatched boats to retrieve the bodies so that family members can identify them.</p>

<h3>Huai River Commission and Sassoon &amp; Co. Establish Large Mortgage Loan</h3>
<p>Totaling Two Hundred and Thirty-Eight Thousand Pounds, Approximately Four Million Yuan</p>
<p>Contract Formally Signed, Using Sino-British Boxer Indemnity as Guarantee</p>
<p>*Shen Shi News* reports that the Huai River Commission, in order to carry out the Huai River project, previously negotiated with the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee for a Huai River loan of nine million yuan. The Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board of Directors officially approved the loan. However, the Huai River Commission needed a large amount of cash to cope with the various Huai River projects urgently, while the British funds would be allocated in installments. Therefore, they mortgaged a large sum of money from the lending department of Sassoon &amp; Co. in Shanghai. According to the *Shen Shi News* reporter, after consultation, the loan has been completed. It was decided to use the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity as collateral, with the Huai River Commission borrowing two hundred and thirty-eight thousand pounds, approximately four million Chinese yuan, from Sassoon &amp; Co. The contract was officially signed by the Huai River Commission and Sassoon &amp; Co. on the 12th of this month. The annual interest rate for this large loan is set at six percent, to be repaid in ten years starting from New Year's Day next year, that is, by the end of the 35th year of the Republic of China, the entire amount will be repaid. The large loan borrowed by the Huai River Commission will be used for regulating water conservancy projects. The entire loan of two hundred and thirty-eight thousand pounds has been paid in full after the signing of the contract. It is also learned that after the establishment of this mortgage loan, no public bonds will be issued separately.</p>
<h3>Third Batch of Hong Kong Silver Arrived Yesterday</h3>
<p>Money Dealers Announce That Two-Day Tickets Can Be Settled on the Same Day</p>
<p>Decline in Foreign Exchange Rates Due Entirely to Gradual Stabilization of Finance</p>
<p>The Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee purchased silver from Hong Kong. Yesterday, the third batch, amounting to five hundred thousand and two hundred yuan, arrived. The Money Dealers' Guild announced that two-day tickets for next month can be settled on the same day. Details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Three Batches of Silver Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee entrusted the Shanghai Branch of the China Communications Bank to purchase 20 million yuan in silver to stabilize the market. The first and second batches had already arrived in Shanghai and were stored in the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Communications Bank. The third batch, loaded on the Dollar Company's President McKinley, also arrived in Shanghai at 12:00 noon yesterday. Staff from the Bank of China and the Communications Bank were dispatched to retrieve the silver. According to Xi Demao, a member of the Committee, the silver is worth 500,002 yuan in national currency. The fourth batch is also on its way.</p>
<h3>Two-Day Tickets Settled on the Same Day</h3>
<p>The Money Dealers' Guild yesterday notified its member money shops, saying: "Greetings. We received a letter from the Shanghai Foreign Banks Association stating that the end of the year settlement period coincides with a Sunday, and member banks will be closed for the holiday as usual. Please make an exception and waive the transfer of all two-day tickets from your businesses and settle them on the same day. The matter was submitted to the 68th Standing Committee for review, which decided that all tickets expiring on February 2nd and 3rd should be settled on the same day, regardless of whether they are to be transferred. The time for foreign banks to collect and settle on the 2nd will be extended to 5:00 PM. We hereby record this matter for your information. Please take note."</p>
<h3>Important Reasons for the Decline in Foreign Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>A reporter from *Xin Sheng News* inquired with the Money Dealers' Guild yesterday and learned that the foreign exchange rate opened in the market yesterday was one dime, a difference of five dimes compared to the highest rate. The most important reasons for the decline in foreign exchange rates are: (1) Since the Stabilization Committee purchased silver and transported it to Shanghai to regulate finance, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Communications Bank have designated funds and prepared silver for money dealers to borrow; (2) As the closing period approaches, money shops, except for long-term loans, routinely recover all loans and temporarily suspend new loans in order to close their accounts.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Telephone Company Revises New Fee Regulations</h3>
<p>In Accordance with the Provisions of the Franchise</p>
<p>Yesterday, a Special Request Was Submitted to the Concession Authorities</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Company plans to revise its new telephone fee regulations from April 1st of this year. It submitted detailed reasons to the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession authorities yesterday, requesting that the revised new telephone fee regulations be collected from April 1, 1935, in accordance with the provisions of the franchise. It will be implemented after approval. It is noted that this franchise stipulates that the company is allowed to obtain eight percent, plus two percent, of the total invested amount in pure annual profit after completing the reconstruction of the entire automatic telephone project and being able to apply its resources. However, the company sent a letter to the authorities on August 5, 1930, stating that it was willing to accept the telephone rates recorded in the Ansheng report of November 29, 1929, for a period of three full years after the completion of the automatic project, that is, until March 27, 1935. However, since its implementation, the company has not obtained the pure profit stipulated in the franchise. This time, it has to fulfill the clauses of the supplementary contract contained in the company's public letter of August 5, 1930, because the company should indeed enjoy the prescribed full amount of profit income. When the company took over the Shanghai China-Foreign Telephone Company on August 5, 1930, it was willing to rebuild the old company's assets and planned to complete the task of providing automatic telephone equipment for the International Settlement and the French Concession in two years. Fortunately, thanks to the hard work and careful planning of those involved, this major replacement project was completed four months ahead of schedule, which is equivalent to providing 18 percent earlier use convenience to users in all sectors. Furthermore, to verify this by the average number of calls, before the automatic system was opened in 1931, the average number of calls per user per day was only 7.12. After it was opened, the number increased dramatically, no longer adding slightly on a horizontal line as before. Even with the unusual commercial situation in 1934, this average number of calls has more than doubled, reaching 14.81, which is clear evidence of this. From this, it can be seen that increasing the number of calls is indeed of value to users because the company uses the most sophisticated methods and excellent work to serve its customers. As the number of uses increases, the company's various mechanical line equipment also increases accordingly, and the company's capital interest, depreciation, maintenance, operation, and other expenses also need to increase accordingly. During the previous replacement and upgrade, in addition to being used for urgently needed equipment, the capital was also used for additional load capacity to cope with the gradual expected development. If it were not for the heavy use of existing users, the company's headquarters equipment and components could have been used for new business. Because it could not be done as desired, the company was forced to increase capital expenditures to cope with new business. Furthermore, telephone agencies aim to communicate information. The company's expansion in 1930 was far beyond expectations, adding user telephone numbers, that is, a group of users could communicate more and further to obtain information. At the end of 1930, there were a total of 33,537 telephone numbers connected to the central exchange, and at the end of 1934, it had increased to 51,783, a comparative increase of 54.41 percent. This shows that the expansion of the application scope is clearly beneficial to users. In summary, the users enjoy more benefits, and the company's experience over the years has had the opposite result, all of which are extremely bad. From the implementation on August 5, 1930, to December 31, 1933, the company's blood capital has repeatedly increased, and the gains have been minimal, so much so that it cannot pay dividends to shareholders. The old company also had the same situation. It paid the last dividend of the year to its shareholders on March 21, 1929, and the Shanghai Telephone Company cannot use the funds under the general reserve account for this reason, because the reserve is an important lifeline for the company's business. The company has done its best to offer a reliable telephone business with a single purpose. All observations show that the company has also achieved this goal. Its machinery is built in an economical way, and expenses are saved, but it strives to improve telephone usage. The above points are all realized under the company's current management system, and the company's total capital expenditure is not huge, and there are no large amounts of surplus materials left, which can be used to meet the immediate needs of users without delay. Therefore, the company sincerely hopes that all sectors of society can complete the other aspect of this business in reason and pay telephone charges sufficient to enable the company to pay the interest stipulated in the franchise contract on the company's investment amount. As for the various telephone rates in the new regulations, they will be announced separately soon.</p>

<h3>Tongyi Bank Announced Closure Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Entrusted to Accountant Xu Yongzuo to Investigate and Collect Debts, *Xin Sheng News* reports that Tongyi Bank Co., Ltd. was founded in August of the tenth year of the Republic of China, with a total capital of 3 million yuan and a paid-up capital of 750,000 yuan.

<h3>Announcement of Closure</h3>
<p>The bank announced its closure yesterday and entrusted accountant Xu Yongzuo to investigate. The accountant's announcement is recorded below: "According to the chairman of the board of directors of Tongyi Bank Co., Ltd., the bank has been affected by the sluggish market, making it difficult to recover loans and cope with withdrawals, resulting in the bank's inability to turn over funds. The business has had to be temporarily suspended. In addition to actively collecting debts and convening a special meeting of shareholders, the bank has entrusted your accounting firm to represent the bank in announcing a temporary suspension of business, investigating accounts, and collecting debts. In addition to accepting the entrustment, the accountant hereby makes the following announcement."</p>
<h3>Investigation Begins</h3>
<p>A reporter from *Xin Sheng News* met with accountant Xu Yongzuo yesterday morning. According to him, Tongyi Bank has been in business for 14 years, with a paid-up capital of 750,000 yuan. The temporary suspension of business and investigation is actually due to the fact that the loans that have been issued are difficult to recover at once, and depositors are withdrawing their deposits, making it impossible to cope and leading to a standstill. The bank's accounts have now been sent to this accounting firm to begin investigation. Deposits amount to about 1.6 to 1.7 million yuan, and loans are also 1.6 to 1.7 million yuan, offsetting each other with no losses. The vast majority of deposits and loans are to salt merchants from Zhejiang Province, accounting for three-quarters, and salt merchants from Jiangsu Province account for one-quarter. There are very few other deposits. The salt business has been in decline in recent years, leading to this predicament. Chairman Zhang Danru has personally advanced 700,000 to 800,000 yuan, but it is still not enough to cope with the situation, and it is difficult to continue to advance more funds, so the temporary suspension and investigation was announced. According to a senior employee of the bank, the creditors' meeting will be held on the 6th and 7th of next month. It is difficult to predict whether the bank can resume business.</p>
<h3>Eighty-Eighth Batch of Overseas Chinese Expelled from Japan Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Zhou Chengxin and Two Others</p>
<p>Returned Home on the *Shanghai Maru*</p>
<p>The 88th batch of overseas Chinese expelled from Japan, Zhou Chengxin, Hu Desheng and two others, arrived in Shanghai at 12:00 noon yesterday on the *Shanghai Maru*. The two overseas Chinese are both from Fujian Province. After landing, they temporarily stayed at the Fuxin Inn in Hongkou. According to overseas Chinese Zhou Chengxin speaking to a reporter from the Industrial News Agency, "We have been running restaurants in Japan for sixteen years. Although we have suffered all kinds of unreasonable oppression from the Japanese police, we had to endure it to make a living. The Japanese government now dares to risk the great disapproval of the world and suddenly arrested us, detained us in the police station, and closed the restaurants we were running on false charges such as espionage. We were forced to board the *Shanghai Maru* and deported back to our country. The meager assets we have accumulated over the years have been confiscated, so that we have returned to our country penniless and our livelihoods are extremely difficult." The overseas Chinese are currently trying to borrow money to return to their hometown as soon as possible, so as not to be stranded in a foreign land.</p>
<h3>National Sports Commission Sends Letter to Municipal Party Headquarters Explaining Nature of National Medical Center</h3>
<p>Belongs to Academic Organizations</p>
<p>The Central National Movement Guidance Committee yesterday sent a letter to the Municipal Party Headquarters explaining the nature of the Central National Medical Center and its branches, saying: "Greetings. The party headquarters of Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, and other provinces have repeatedly submitted requests to explain the organizational system of the branches of the Central National Medical Center and whether the party headquarters should guide them. After investigating, the Central National Medical Center is registered with the Executive Yuan. After inquiring by letter whether it belongs to a government agency, we received a reply stating, 'The center belongs to the organization of academic organizations and is not an administrative agency.' Since the center is not an administrative agency, in terms of its purpose, organization, and funding, it is clearly not a mass organization, but an academic organization established by the government to study and improve national medicine. It should be temporarily interpreted as follows: (1) The Central National Medical Center is not a mass organization, and the party headquarters does not need to guide its branches; (2) The Central National Medical Center is an academic organization that studies national medicine, and its branches must not interfere with health administration; (3) If there are disputes in the branches of the Central National Medical Center in each locality, they should be resolved in accordance with the above two principles. In addition to replying by letter and distributing copies, this letter is hereby sent for your information and to instruct you to act accordingly. This is addressed to the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters."</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Submits Petition Urging Prompt Enactment of Commercial Registration Law</h3>
<p>Industry and Commerce are Declining, and the Need is Urgent</p>
<p>Please Draft and Implement the Law Immediately</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday submitted a petition to the Legislative Yuan, saying: "The matter is to submit a petition. The case is that your esteemed Yuan adopted the proposal of Legislative Yuan member Wu Kaixian and others regarding partnership organizations, to formulate a commercial registration law to remedy the situation. The Commercial Law Committee of your esteemed Yuan drafted a commercial registration law draft of thirty-five articles. Article 9 of the case stated that partners who have been approved for registration by the competent authorities shall be responsible for sharing losses within the limits of their contributions. This draft was discussed once by the joint meeting of the Civil Law and Commercial Law Committees of your esteemed Yuan. As a result, it was left unresolved and still needs to be reviewed on a rescheduled date. At that time, the representatives of the association who attended the meeting of your esteemed Yuan, Chen and Luo, reported the previous situation, stating that Article 9 of the original draft conformed to the unanimous request of the national business community over the years and truly met the needs of the national conditions. On November 6 of last year, they submitted a letter to your esteemed Yuan, stating their sincere support and requesting that a layer of verification and transfer of registration documents by the industry association or chamber of commerce be added to Article 2 of the draft. Subsequently, on November 30, they received a reply from the secretariat of your esteemed Yuan, stating that it had been approved and submitted to the Civil Law and Commercial Law Committees for reference. Now, more than two months have passed since this case, and there has been no news of your esteemed Yuan rescheduling a review, making it impossible to refer to in case of need. Merchants in various industries are eagerly awaiting and constantly inquiring. It is believed that your esteemed Yuan has been making every effort to discuss and implement important laws in recent years. Partnership is the most common form of business in our country, and the commercial registration law is the only criterion for handling partnership debts. At this time of severe decline in industry and commerce, the need is no less urgent than other important laws. It is appropriate to prepare a document and submit it to your esteemed Yuan for review, and to promptly schedule another review meeting, adopt the opinions previously submitted by the association, and draft a law so that it can be submitted for promulgation and implementation. The urgency of waiting for orders is extreme. Respectfully submitted."</p>

After convening a special committee and re-discussing, it was unanimously agreed that shipping industry cooperation is the only way to save the current shipping industry crisis. We are grateful for the earnest guidance of your esteemed Ministry. Rather than arguing over the terms, it is better to proceed as soon as possible to seek the realization of cooperation. Therefore, the decision to send members to the Ministry has been abandoned. The various articles of the original plan that need to be revised have also been revised in accordance with the directives of your esteemed Ministry. It is appropriate to submit another document for your review. Furthermore, after the revised plan is approved by your esteemed Ministry, the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will jointly push representatives with the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association to establish a preparatory office for the China Shipping Industry Cooperative Society in accordance with the cooperation plan, to start preparations and widely solicit participation from colleagues in order to realize the plan. Regarding the directive of your esteemed Ministry, we intend to deliberate on the situation and submit a request for instructions after the establishment of the cooperative society preparatory office, regarding the implementation of cooperation on the Yangtze River ports first. Furthermore, after the preparatory office is established, the association intends to handle the closing and transfer all files to the preparatory office for takeover. Are the above items appropriate?

<h3>First Special Court Clerk's Office Reply to the Bar Association</h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of upholding court dignity</p>
<p>The Clerk's Office of the First Special District Court of Jiangsu and Shanghai replied to the Shanghai Bar Association, stating: We received your letter of January 18, stating that on the 11th of this month, it was reported that Ke Yinghao, relying on his Japanese nationality, roared and insulted lawyer Zhu Siding in the court of this court. , and asked to maintain the dignity of the court. If Ke Yinghao takes illegal actions again during the re-hearing, he should be corrected immediately. The court accepted the case of Liu Yide suing Ke Yinghao for rent arrears and eviction. During the court hearing on the morning of the 10th of this month, the defendant Ke Yinghao and the plaintiff’s litigation agent, lawyer Zhu Siding, had a dispute over the issue of nationality. After the judge ordered him to come to the dock for questioning, he turned around and accused the lawyer loudly. The judge sternly rebuked him and ordered the bailiff to take him back to the defendant's seat. When he left the court after the interrogation, he turned his head and cursed again. The judge ordered the bailiff to urge him to leave the court as soon as possible. This was the situation in the court at that time. The letter was obtained from hearsay, saying that he assaulted the lawyer in court, which does not match the facts. If the defendant's actions that day were as described in the letter, then this court would be more concerned about maintaining the dignity of the court than any other party. No matter what country the offender is from, the judge would have punished him according to the law long ago, without waiting for his next illegal action to be corrected. I approve of the letter and hereby reply for your information. This is addressed to the Shanghai Bar Association.</p>
<h3>Association for Promoting Fire Insurance Compensation in Disaster Areas Asks the Social Affairs Bureau to Allocate Funds</h3>
<p>Disaster victims gathered separately to discuss, with fierce disputes</p>
<p>Regarding the fire insurance compensation in the Zhabei disaster area, disputes arose when a meeting was held at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce the day before yesterday to discuss the distribution plan. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 pm, a group of more than 300 disaster victims gathered at the Zhabei Charity Group on Datong Road. Fan Yifeng and Yuan Shixing both attended the meeting. For fear of misunderstanding by the disaster victims, they specifically stated the reasons for their opposition to the distribution. The reason for the objection is purely to obtain more compensation. Now, they only want to withdraw 10,000 yuan from 40,000 yuan, and the rest is used for an average distribution to more than 4,000 households, with each household receiving only 6 yuan, 1 jiao, 6 cents, and 1 li. I think each policyholder can sympathize with this objection. However, some policyholders requested Fan and Yuan to invite Tang Youwei and Wang Zhixiang to convene another general meeting for distribution. The Xinzha Branch Bureau and the Zhabei Security Corps, fearing that disputes would arise, added police officers to maintain order in advance. There are also some policyholders who plan to hold a meeting at the Sanyang Road World Grand Theater today to discuss the distribution plan. Association committee members Yu Qiaqing and others submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday for distribution, and decided to advance funds to repay the debts. The original text is as follows: This is a request for the matter. It is checked that the Shanghai Disaster Area Fire Insurance Negotiation Case has been in dispute for nearly three years. Fortunately, the bureau has tried its best to find a way to end the matter. On the morning of the 20th of this month at 9 o'clock, a meeting of all policyholders was convened at the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The original plan was to discuss and decide on the distribution and closing methods in order to make suggestions to the bureau for reference and handling. There are more than 2,000 people in Zhongli, but the amount of money is very small and distribution is difficult. In the courtyard, the discussion is divergent and there is no consensus, and the reporters and others have no way to advocate. Therefore, in addition to the proposed items, such as (1) From April 1932 to January 1934, a total of 6,765 yuan, 9 jiao, and 8 points of silver were spent. The accountant Pan has reviewed this amount and issued a detailed report on January 22, 1934. ) (2) Since January 22, 1934, a total of 804 yuan, 4 jiao, and 5 points of silver have been spent (detailed accounts are attached separately) (The above expenses are all borrowed by the committee members and policyholders) (3) Prepare 550 yuan of silver for closing expenses (detailed accounts are attached separately) (4) The claims committee wrote to request 2,940 yuan of silver for transportation expenses (letter attached) (5) The committee decided to send souvenirs to personnel who have provided great assistance from all parties, totaling 500 yuan of silver, etc. In addition to reporting to the conference, it is difficult to discuss how to distribute the remaining number. Furthermore, it is checked that the total number of policyholders is 4,534, and the total insured amount is more than 18.16 million yuan. All the expenses are extremely small, and there are many households to be dispatched. It is difficult to find a suitable method. On the other hand, the disaster victims are crying out for food and need to be distributed urgently. It is difficult to delay the disaster relief. Therefore, it is impossible to do so. I have to submit it to the bureau, and I will quickly formulate a plan for distribution and repay the arrears. I respectfully present this to the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<h3>Workers from Puyi Yarn Factory Petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau Yesterday after the Factory Closed Down</h3>
<p>The factory issued remaining wages yesterday, but the workers refused to accept them</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, Puyi Yarn Factory's Factory No. 1 on West Suzhou Road and Factory No. 2 on Moganshan Road were affected by the social depression and closed down on New Year's Day. Yesterday morning, the factory issued a notice ordering all workers to collect their remaining wages. Due to livelihood reasons, the workers were unwilling to accept the wages. At around 9:00 am, more than 3,000 people gathered at the factory to demand that work resume. The Putu Road Patrol Station dispatched a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to the scene to maintain order for fear of incidents. Later, the workers failed to have their demands met, so they went to Yinxuetang on Tokyo Road for a meeting. At 2:00 pm, representatives such as Wang Zhuping led more than 4,000 workers, took Xiang Sheng cars, and petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau. Wang Gang of the Third Section received them and promised to investigate and approve the workers' requests: (1) Demand immediate resumption of work; (2) Wages during the shutdown period shall be paid as usual; (3) Request subsidies for delayed resumption of work; (4) Workers shall not be dismissed without reason after work resumes; (5) Request 5 yuan for meals during the New Year period. The representatives were satisfied and returned.</p>
<h3>Various Trade Associations Actively Submit Donations for Emergency Relief</h3>
<p>The General Association for Emergency Relief and Universal Donations handles universal donations from various industries in the business community. It assesses and assigns donation amounts based on the scope and economic situation of each industry, and encourages donations from each industry association. Since its implementation, the results have been good. Yesterday, it was reported that the Clothing Industry Association submitted 410 yuan, and the Fresh Pork Industry Association submitted 50 yuan. The association also received 500 yuan from Fang Shiru for universal donations, 15 yuan and 8 jiao from Xin Xin Amusement Park, 52 jiao from Yingming Photo Studio, 1 yuan and 54 jiao from Guanglu Photo Studio, 31 yuan and 102 jiao from Zhenru Xiaoju.</p>
<p>The General Association for Emergency Relief and Universal Donations previously received 500 rice coupons from Wansheng Dyeing Factory, each coupon for 2 sheng, totaling 10 shi. The Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Union Office also donated 30 sets of new cotton clothes and trousers, 27 pieces of old cotton clothes and trousers, and a bundle of shoes and hats. It is reported that a letter has been sent to the drought relief associations in various provinces to forward them to the disaster areas for relief. It is also reported that the Shanghai Bank received 100 yuan from the Dade Rubber Manufacturing Factory yesterday.</p>
<h3>More Than 2,500 Poor People Housed in Two Shelters in Nanshi</h3>
<p>Sudden cold weather makes it crowded and miserable</p>
<p>Daily rice consumption requires 19 shi</p>
<p>Wang Yiting and Huang Hanzhi, chairmen of the Shanghai Charity Federation, believe that in recent years, rural areas have gone bankrupt, industry and commerce have declined, and the drought in various provinces last year has been severe. The city has a large population and the number of poor people is increasing. The unemployed have no way to live. In December last year, following the instructions of the Social Affairs Bureau, two shelters were established at the Chaozhou Guild Hall and Chaozhou Huishan Villa in Hunan, Shanghai. Since the beginning, the shelters have housed poor people, totaling more than 2,500 people. The daily rice consumption requires about 19 shi. Recently, the weather has suddenly turned cold, and the number of people entering the shelters is crowded and miserable. According to Zhang Yuxin, director of the shelters, in the past two months, the association has raised funds from enthusiastic donors from all walks of life, including 6,000 yuan from the Shanghai Charity Federation, 1,000 yuan each from the China Jiesheng Association, the Yimiao Board of Directors, and the Disaster Relief Committee. 500 yuan each from the Xinwei Relief Association, Guangyi Shantang, Lianyishan Association, Flour Exchange, Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, Yan Weilian, China Electric Company, and Renji Shantang. 300 yuan each from Pushan Villa, Securities Exchange, Gauze Exchange, and Inland Tap Water Company. 100 yuan each from the Hunan Charity Association, Wang Yiting, and the Grain Exchange. 200 yuan each from Weizhong Shantang, Douchi Industry Association, and Grain Industry Association. 50 yuan each from the Shanghai Jixin Association, Stack Industry Association, Tongyi Public Welfare Association, Puji Public Welfare Association, and Yuanji Shantang. In addition, the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau ordered water stove companies to donate 2, 3, or 5 yuan, totaling about 200 yuan, for a total of more than 16,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hubei Provincial Government Replies to Hubei Fellow Villagers Association on Tax Exemption and Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>The Hubei Native Place Association in Shanghai raised funds for the Hubei Province Water and Drought Disaster Relief Committee. It previously telegraphed the Hubei Provincial Government to exempt the disaster-stricken counties in the province from taxes and surcharges to alleviate the people's burden. Yesterday, it received a reply from the Hubei Provincial Government, stating that the severity of the disaster in Hubei Province this time is unprecedented in recent years. The Civil and Financial Departments have been ordered to send personnel to conduct on-site surveys and provide as much relief as possible. Considering the special circumstances of the disaster this year, the Department of Finance has formulated standards for waiving land tax fractions, and the county magistrates of the disaster-stricken counties have been instructed to report on the disaster-stricken areas and the extent of the disaster. All of them have been reviewed and approved based on the standards, and orders have been issued to suspend the collection of taxes separately. The Hubei Native Place Association in Shanghai was very pleased to receive this news.</p>
<h3>Sheng Xuanhuai Appointed as Director of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Joint Company by the Ministry of Finance</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways and the governments of Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces previously organized the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Joint Company in order to develop and connect the Jiang-Yu and Ping-Lines. The company is very large, with an authorized capital of 60 million yuan. The highest executive body is the Board of Directors. The Ministry of Railways and the governments of Jiangxi and Zhejiang provinces each send two directors, the Ministry of Finance sends one director, the banking sector sends three directors, and the directors of the railway bureau are ex officio directors, for a total of thirteen directors who handle the company's important affairs. It is now reported that Sheng Xuanhuai, Director of the Jiangsu Stamp Tax Bureau for Tobacco and Alcohol, has been appointed concurrently as the director representing the Ministry of Finance in the company.</p>
<h3>Conference of the Silk Industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Discusses Silk Cloth Prices</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Weaving Joint Association recently received letters from silk industry associations in various places reporting that silk prices are soaring. Factory silk has risen by four cents, and native silk has risen by two cents, which has increased the cost of silk cloth production. However, the selling price is very different, and they requested a public decision. Based on this, a joint meeting of representatives of silk industry groups from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces was convened on the 19th of this month. More than a dozen representatives from Suzhou Gauze and Satin Industry, Suzhou Tiezhi Silk Weaving Industry, Danyang Silk Industry, Danyang Machine Weaving Industry, Danyang Silk Industry, Hangzhou Silk Industry, Shanghai Su Satin Group, Yuanchou Group, and Shengchou Group attended the meeting. The meeting started at 4:00 pm, and Wang Jiean was elected as the chairman. After the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting and read the letters from various places, the representatives successively expressed their opinions. It was decided to publish an announcement in the newspaper that silk cloth prices would be raised uniformly from February 1 of this year. As for how much the price should be raised, it should be decided by each gang according to different circumstances. A newspaper announcement, as well as a discussion of other important matters, tea and snacks will be served at the adjournment.</p>
<h3>Dr. Jiang Kanghu Lectured at the Chinese Staff Club</h3>
<p>Bingxun Shorthand Agency provided shorthand services</p>
<p>The Labour Bureau Chinese Staff Club held its second academic lecture at 5:30 pm yesterday at the Labour Bureau Health Sub-Bureau at 340 Sanma Road. Dr. Jiang Kanghu was invited to be the lecturer. The topic was "Foreigners' Research on Chinese Culture." Jin Bosheng was the chairman, and more than 100 people attended the lecture. Bingxun Shorthand Agency was specially hired by Dr. Jiang to provide shorthand services. The lecture lasted about an hour, and the attendees were not tired. The following is a summary of Dr. Jiang's lecture: Foreigners did not initially know the value of Chinese culture. They only knew that China produced porcelain and silk. The various reasons that led foreigners to study Chinese culture can be described as follows: First, because foreigners liked Chinese porcelain and silk. The porcelain had words and paintings, and the silk had patterns, which attracted foreigners' attention to the culture of Chinese writing and art. The second reason is the development of transportation. Now it only takes a few days to travel between Europe and Asia, and communication only takes a few seconds. This is also a reason that promotes foreigners' attention to Chinese culture. The third is that Western missionaries came to China to preach, and Western scholars came to China to lecture. After returning to their countries, they aroused the interest of foreigners in studying Chinese culture. The fourth is that Chinese scholars went abroad to lecture. The fifth is that after the European War, Westerners were skeptical of material civilization, and then studied Indian culture, as well as Chinese culture that was neither biased towards materialism nor biased towards idealism. The sixth is because of Japan's strength, which aroused Westerners' interest in studying Japanese culture. They knew that Japanese culture all originated from China, so they became interested in studying Chinese culture. Foreigners who study Chinese culture initially trusted missionaries who had preached in China and returned to their countries. Later, there were many scholars who specialized in studying Chinese culture and translated Chinese Analects, Mencius, Lao Tzu, Zhuang Tzu, Tang poetry, etc. into foreign languages. However, because they lack scholarly common sense, they sometimes study very well, but sometimes they make ridiculous mistakes. For example, "Yuyang Turtle Drum Moves the Earth" is translated into Fish Kin drum. There are many similar jokes. We must avoid foreigners' misunderstanding of Chinese culture and publicize Chinese culture abroad. This is the responsibility of Chinese scholars, especially students studying abroad. Therefore, I recently initiated a Chinese-Foreign Cultural Association for this purpose. Our promotion of Chinese culture is to improve China's status.</p>
<h3>New Chief Prosecutor of the Second Branch of the High Court Takes Office</h3>

<h3>Further Inquiry into the Kidnapping Case of Gao Maogong</h3>
<p>The kidnapping case of Gao Maogong, an engineer at Shunchang Iron Works on Zhongshan Road, was reported in detail in previous reports. Since Gao was kidnapped, many days have passed, and there is no news from the bandits, and no letters have been received. The family is very anxious. It is learned that the factory is not large in scale and is a joint labor industry. The factory director is not Ma Rongguan, but someone else. Ma is only a young man in his twenties who just graduated from school and is interning in the factory, no different from the workers. The case is quite peculiar, and the police authorities are vigorously pursuing it.</p>
<h3>Almost Died from Coal Ball Heating After Childbirth</h3>
<p>Xia Yunfeng, a Qingjiang native who lived at No. 285 McLeckie Road, Tilanqiao, Shanghai, worked as a gatekeeper for the patrol station. His wife, Ms. Liu, a Qingjiang native, was 19 years old. This was her first pregnancy. Three days after giving birth, she was still weak. Because the weather was extremely cold, she burned a coal stove for heating. Unexpectedly, she did not open the doors and windows, and the fire in the coal stove was very strong, causing coal poisoning. A roommate happened to come into the room to visit and saw the woman lying stiffly on the bed. She shouted for help, and the neighbors gathered. Her husband happened to be late returning from work, substituting for Wu at the same time. He quickly sent someone to inform him. Her husband rushed over after hearing the news. The woman was unconscious and barely breathing. He quickly hired a car and sent her to the Tilanqiao Hongkou People's Maternity Hospital. After examination by the doctor, she finally woke up, and her life was saved.</p>
<h3>A Passenger Dies Tragically at South Station</h3>
<p>At approximately 4:55 PM yesterday, a Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway train No. 62, a slow train of third and fourth class carriages, arrived at the Shanghai South Station from Zhapu Station. It stopped at the second platform, and the passengers disembarked in a crowded manner. Among the fourth-class passengers was a traveler, about sixty years of age, wearing a blue silk cotton long robe, an outer blue cloth long gown, a blue silk cotton padded jacket, trousers tied at the ankles, gray socks, black cloth shoes, and a melon-rind cap. The passenger appeared to be a countryman from the Shaoxing area. Instead of exiting through the left-side door adjacent to the second platform, he jumped down onto the tracks on the opposite right side, intending to climb up to the third platform. At that moment, a locomotive dispatched from the engine house was backing up on the third platform track. The passenger was about to get onto the platform but failed to climb up in time, resulting in his abdomen being crushed between the locomotive and the platform. He died instantly before medical treatment could be administered. Stationmaster Zhou immediately dispatched police to carry the body onto the third platform to take care of it and to inspect the deceased's belongings. These included one silver dollar and twenty cents, forty-two small silver coins, ninety-one copper coins, two salted chickens, two bags of New Year cake, a pair of overshoes, and a pipe of tobacco. These were taken to the police section for safekeeping. Stationmaster Zhou also ordered the local headman to go to the local court for an inquest and to summon the deceased's family to the station to identify the body and arrange for a coffin.</p>
<h3>Robbery and Assault on Victim on Xie Xu Road</h3>
<p>At approximately 5:00 AM yesterday, four robbers speaking with a Suqian accent and dressed in blue cloth shirts and trousers suddenly broke into the home of Chen Shaowu at No. 17, Feng Bo Lane, Xie Xu Road, in the Nanshi area. The robbers were from the same hometown as Chen Shaowu. Armed with axes, iron tools, and other weapons, they broke in, having learned that Chen had won over eighty silver dollars in a rotating credit association. At the time, Chen and his sister-in-law were living together and were not yet awake. The robbers made off with all eighty-three silver dollars that were won. Because Chen Shaowu and his sister-in-law, Chen Du Shi, struggled with the robbers, they were wounded on the head and right arm. The injuries were quite severe, and both were sent to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. In addition to dispatching police officers to investigate, the local police station reported the matter to the Ximen Branch Bureau for handling.</p>
<h3>Two People Freeze to Death in Pudong</h3>
<p>The weather has been severely cold in recent days, especially at night. Many homeless beggars who lack food and clothing are unable to withstand the extreme cold, and deaths from freezing have been reported daily. The night before last, the body of a man, about forty years of age and dressed in rags, was found collapsed at the foot of the wall of the Yi Tai Xing Coal Shop at the Sanguantang Dongjia Ferry in Pudong. In addition, the body of an unknown woman, about thirty years of age, with a face stained with opium and as thin as a rake, was found collapsed in the Qiu Family Residence south of Sanguantang. Her ten fingers were stained red, indicating that she had a fondness for opium in her lifetime. Yesterday morning, the local police station instructed the local headman, Zhu Zhangquan, to report the matter to the local court and request an inquest. In the afternoon, commissioned Inspector Zhao Chuanjia led forensic examiners to Pudong to conduct separate examinations and determined that both had died of illness and freezing. They ordered that the bodies be coffined and buried by charity organizations.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Avenue Edward VII</h3>
<p>At approximately 4:30 PM yesterday, two robbers suddenly arrived at the residence of a certain surname at No. 23, Lane 448, Avenue Edward VII. Only one of the robbers carried a handgun. They first confined all the people in the house and prevented them from making any noise. They then forced them to hand over the keys to the silver safe, wardrobe, and other storage places. They opened the doors and ransacked the place, looting extensively. They only fled with their loot after about half an hour. Afterward, the victim urgently reported the matter to the local French Concession police station, which dispatched detectives to investigate. As the robbers had already escaped, the police redeployed detectives to pursue them and investigate the losses, which were estimated to be over seven hundred taels of silver.</p>

<h3>Robbery and Murder of a Money Escort at Yuan Heng Bank</h3>
<p>Second Escort Grapples with a Robber and Shouts for Help</p>
<p>First Escort, Confined, is Shot and Killed</p>
<p>Robbers Get Nothing and Flee in Panic</p>
<p>Yuan Heng Bank, located in rooms 201 and 202 on the second floor of No. 130 Tianjin Road in the Public Concession, specializes in public bonds, securities, and deposit transactions. Its business is doing quite well. At around 9:00 AM yesterday, Yang Ruiliang, a 32-year-old Chongming native and employee of the Jiu Da Tobacco Shop at No. 617 Tiantong Road, went to the bank to deposit silver dollars worth two thousand yuan. The staff was counting the money and placing it on the counter when four well-dressed men suddenly walked into the bank, claiming to be detectives from the police station there to search for opium. They first confined Yang Ruiliang, who was outside the counter, to room 202. Then, each of them pulled out a handgun and ordered the staff to open all the drawers. At that moment, one of the men retreated to the door to stand guard. The three men inside, seeing that they had found nothing, ordered the silver safe to be opened. The staff, seeing that the men's actions were out of line, realized that they were not good people and claimed that the manager had not arrived and they could not open it. While they were hesitating, Liang Daxi, an employee of the Yuan Shun Tobacco Shop at No. 605 Tiantong Road, arrived with money to deposit. Seeing two men guarding the door with handguns and looking flustered, he realized that they were robbers and, disregarding the danger, grabbed one of the robbers from behind and shouted for help. The three robbers inside heard the commotion and panicked. Not having time to rob anything, they drew their guns and rushed out, firing at Liang. However, Liang was very agile and pushed the robber he was holding forward, using him as a shield. Therefore, the robbers could not get a clear shot. At that moment, Yang Ruiliang, who had been confined in the adjacent room, suddenly rushed out in a panic. The robbers, in desperation, thought he was reporting them to the police and quickly fired two shots at Yang, who immediately fell to the ground. At this point, Liang Daxi felt a chill and quickly released his grip and fled. The robbers also rushed downstairs and escaped. The bank staff immediately telephoned the police station, and a large number of armed detectives rushed to the scene. However, the robbers had already fled far away. They turned to help the wounded man, but he was barely breathing. He was rushed to the hospital, but he died from a bullet wound to the head. The body was immediately sent to the coroner's office for examination. Meanwhile, detectives were dispatched in all directions to pursue the fugitives.</p>

<p>Advise Rickshaw Pullers to Register</p>
<p>Pass Rental Contract</p>
<p>Rickshaw owners in the Special District convened a general meeting of all owners at 9:00 AM yesterday at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce auditorium. Over five hundred and fifty people attended, including Gu Songmao, Hou Shao'an, Xi Jieren, Lu Dexin, and Jin Chunlin. Gu Songmao, Hou Shao'an, Yin Zhiling (represented by Yin Zhifang), and two others served as the presidium. After the meeting was opened, Gu Songmao first reported that the rickshaw owners were very much in favor of registering the rickshaw pullers, but some rickshaw pullers issued a declaration opposing it, and the rickshaw committee, without investigation, said that the rickshaw owners were making things difficult. However, rickshaw owners, in order to protect their own interests, of course absolutely sympathize with registration. Then, the discussion began. (1) Report on the consultation between the representatives of this office and the Public Works Department's Rickshaw Committee and the general manager regarding the revision of the rickshaw puller's instructions. A proposal was made to immediately advise and encourage rickshaw pullers to register. It was resolved and passed. (2) A proposal to pass the vehicle rental contract was resolved and passed. The contract will be available for collection at the meeting in three days. (3) Rickshaw owners reported on the trial use of new rickshaw models. The rickshaw body is heavy, the poles are wide, it is difficult to exert force, there are few customers, and it is difficult to make money. It was resolved that the rickshaw owners should report the details of the rickshaw pullers' unwillingness to pull to the meeting within a week so that they can negotiate. (4) For those who need to exchange old-style new rickshaw licenses that have been withheld, please issue the licenses first. It was resolved that Representative Yin should negotiate for the return of the rickshaw licenses for business and approve the implementation of the three hundred and fifty old-style new rickshaws.

<h3>Ban on Cattle Coming to Shanghai Lifted</h3>
<p>Foot-and-Mouth Disease Has Decreased After Proper Treatment</p>
<p>Cattle Prices Remain High and Have Not Been Reduced</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease among cattle in this city, people from all walks of life have been considerably affected. The Municipal Health Bureau had submitted a report to the Municipal Government requesting that it forward a message to the Ministry of Railways, ordering the two railway bureaus to temporarily prohibit the transport of cattle to Shanghai for two weeks in order to isolate the source of the disease. After receiving the report, the Ministry of Railways immediately instructed the two railway bureaus to comply. At that time, the price of beef in this city suddenly soared, increasing by six or seven yuan per picul compared to normal times, indirectly affecting all sectors of society. It is now known that the temporary ban expired last week. The number of cattle suffering from foot-and-mouth disease in this city has been greatly reduced, and those that have not been cured have also been given appropriate isolation treatment. However, the price of beef has not fallen. According to yesterday's market price, water buffalo cost sixteen and a half yuan per picul, and yellow cattle ranged from twenty to twenty-two yuan per picul.</p>
<h3>Large Quantity of Cotton Clothing and Trousers Shipped to Disaster Areas for Distribution</h3>
<p>Seven Provinces: Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, Henan, and Hebei</p>
<p>A Total of Four Thousand Four Hundred Items of Cotton Clothing and Trousers</p>
<p>The Shanghai Fundraising Association for Drought Relief in Various Provinces, located on Yunnan Road in this city, felt great pity for the disaster victims in various provinces who lacked clothing and food during this sudden cold weather. Therefore, yesterday, in addition to having the San Bei Company load two thousand bags of flour and eight hundred pieces of new and used cotton clothing and trousers, packed into seventeen packages, onto the Yuan Tong Inland River Steamer to be transported to Hangzhou for distribution by Relief Director Qu Yingguang, today (the 22nd), it entrusted the China Express Company to load six hundred pieces of new and used cotton clothing and trousers, packed into fourteen packages, to be sent to Kaifeng, Henan, and Hebei for distribution by the Relief Director of each province, half and half. In addition, it delivered to San Bei Company's Songpu Steamer six hundred pieces of new and used cotton clothing and trousers to be transported to Nanjing, packed into thirteen packages, eight hundred pieces of new and used cotton clothing and trousers to Anqing and Wuhu, counted as nineteen packages, and eight hundred pieces of new and used cotton clothing and trousers to Hubei, counted as nineteen packages, and eight hundred pieces of new and used cotton clothing and trousers to Hunan, counted as eighteen packages.

<h3>Convenient Transportation in Eastern Zhejiang</h3>
<p>—Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway Can Reach Nanchang by the End of the Year—</p>
<p>Surveying Completed Early, Now Engaged in Filling Soil and Laying Rails</p>
<p>Smooth Transportation Between Zhejiang and Jiangxi Promotes Prosperous Passenger and Freight Transport</p>
<p>Eastern Zhejiang is mostly mountainous, and transportation has been extremely inconvenient. Since the completion of the Hangzhou-Yushan section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the area has been peaceful, and travel has been rapid, incomparable to the past days of boat travel. Now that the Red bandits in Jiangxi Province have been suppressed and commerce has been restored in various places, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is the only shortcut to enter Jiangxi and Fujian. Yushan Station has highways, automobiles, and the Xinjiang waterway that can directly reach Nanchang. Passengers and merchants can transfer to automobiles at Jiangshan Station and travel directly to northern Fujian via Xianxia Ridge, which is very convenient. According to Xinsheng News Agency, the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway, built by the Zhejiang Provincial Government, has become half of the entire line since it was opened to Yushan last year. It is now progressing westward, so the relevant engineering is expected to reach Nanchang, Jiangxi, by the end of this year. The surveying has been completed early, and the work of filling soil and laying rails is now underway. As for the daily passenger transport on the railway, it is also very crowded. Since the railway reached Yushan Road, the upper eight prefectures and the lower three prefectures of Zhejiang Province have been connected, and merchants traveling back and forth every day must pass this road. With the end of the year approaching, merchants are doubly crowded as they come and go to collect accounts, so income is also gradually increasing. Moreover, there are many rich scenic spots along the route, such as the giant waterfall of Wu Xie and the scenery of the various rivers of Fuyang, attracting many tourists. As for freight transport, in addition to transporting the products of the upper eight prefectures of Zhejiang Province, most of the local products of Jiangxi are also transported by this route. Above Yushan, there is the Xin River, which starts from Yushan in the east and reaches Poyang Lake through Shangrao, Hekou, Yiyang, Guixi, and Yujiang in Jiangxi to the west. Due to bandit suppression, it was sometimes blocked, but now that the bandits have been eliminated, passengers and goods can pass without hindrance, and protection along the way is very strict, so the transport of goods on this route has been very prosperous recently.</p>
<h3>Various Oil Companies Continue to Raise Gasoline Prices</h3>
<p>The Price Increase Standard Still Needs to Be Negotiated and Decided</p>
<p>Since the British, American, and Russian oil companies concluded a distribution agreement, gasoline prices have gradually become consistent, rising from five yuan and twenty cents per ten gallons to nine yuan and ten cents. However, this is still far from the cost, so it is planned to raise prices again starting next month. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Company Loses Approximately One Million Yuan Annually</h3>
<p>According to a person in the kerosene industry who spoke to a Dagong News reporter yesterday, although the price of gasoline has risen to nine yuan and ten cents, it is still far from the cost. According to the business observations of various companies over the years, gasoline must be sold for more than twelve yuan per ten gallons to be profitable, so currently, each sale of ten gallons results in a loss of about three yuan. The annual loss for each company is over one million yuan. Fortunately, the oil companies in China are all international in nature, so they can make up for losses with profits elsewhere. After the accounts are settled at the head office, there is still some profit to be made.</p>
<h3>Prices Will Rise Again Starting Next Month</h3>
<p>In view of this, the four major oil companies in China, Mobil, Texaco, Oil Everywhere, and Asiatic Petroleum, have consulted several times this month to discuss raising prices. The specific measures will be determined next month to uniformly increase prices and not deliberately raise or lower prices. Whether the price increase standard will be an increase of one or two yuan on the old price or a new price will be determined after further consultation.</p>
<h3>Suspicious Gunshot Wound Case</h3>
<p>Claims Suicide Due to Severe Illness and Resentment</p>
<p>Handgun Without a License Arouses Suspicion</p>
<p>At 1:10 PM yesterday, the Bao Long Hospital on Route Père Robert suddenly received a phone call from the Long residence at No. 4, Jing Yu Lane, at the intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Muirhead Road, claiming that a man had suddenly fallen ill and requested that a car be sent immediately to take him to the hospital for treatment. After receiving the call, the hospital immediately sent a car. After the man was brought to the hospital, the hospital doctors found that the wound was in the throat and was caused by a gunshot. They became very suspicious. When they asked his family, they claimed that the man had committed suicide with a gun. His name was Long Kehou, he was 32 years old, and he was from Anhui. The hospital, unsure of the truth, reported the matter to the local police station, which dispatched detectives to investigate. However, they did not receive a definite and complete answer. When asked where the handgun was, they said it was at the residence. The detectives went to the residence to investigate and found that the gun was not licensed. The police, concerned that the origin of the weapon was unclear and might be related to other cases, temporarily detained the victim's family while monitoring the victim. However, the victim's condition was serious and critical. After hearing the news, the reporter rushed to investigate. According to his family, the victim had been suffering from liver and stomach ailments, which would come and go. Although he had received various treatments, he had not recovered, so he often complained. This suicide may have been caused by this. It was also learned that his father, Long Yao-shu, had served as the chief of the military law department of the military law section of the governor's office when Chen Diaoyuan governed Anhui in 1926. He is now also residing in Jing Yu Lane and has only this one son.</p>
<h3>Newspaper Reports on the Murder Case at the Guardhouse in the Japanese Settlement</h3>
<p>The Deceased Was Employed by a Japanese Person</p>
<p>The Shapeless Tenant's Actions Are Suspicious</p>
<p>At approximately 8:00 PM the night before last, a young man was assassinated in the guardhouse of the Shapeless Tenant police station at No. 308 Lane, across from the Japanese Club on Route Remi in Hongkou. The details have been reported in this newspaper. However, according to yesterday's Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun, at 9:00 PM on the 20th, a Chinese employee of the Okano Construction Office in front of the Japanese Club on Bengbu Road was suddenly assassinated in the residence of the Shapeless Tenant behind the Inoue Tailor Shop. The perpetrator is unknown. Afterward, staff members of the Public Works Department's Hongkou Office rushed to the scene and searched for evidence and fingerprints in order to pursue the case. According to witnesses, at 8:00 PM, a strange man on a bicycle was seen fleeing behind the Hankou Bank. Soon after, a Chinese man was found murdered. His face, chest, and shoulders were all cut with a sharp kitchen knife. The content of the case is being investigated. According to the Shanghai Daily, the Public Works Department began a strict search after the case occurred. The suspicious Shapeless Tenant who returned home late at night was taken to the Public Works Department and confessed that he was from the same hometown as the victim and confessed various details. Therefore, there are already some clues as to who the real culprit is. However, strange words were found in the room, which read, "When doing things, you must be sharp and leave a footprint with every step."</p>
<h3>Continued Trial of the Longhua Temple Case</h3>
<p>The Dispute Over One Buddha Versus Two Buddhas</p>
<p>The Court Ordered to Summon Witnesses for Further Questioning</p>
<p>Abbot Xingkong of Longhua Temple filed a criminal complaint with the local court against the former abbot, Yuanzhao, for encroaching on temple property and, incidentally, filed a civil lawsuit demanding the return of one hundred and fifteen mu of sold land, ordering that it still be managed by Longhua Temple as usual. As for the seven chapters of valuable Sanskrit palm-leaf scriptures and one ancient bronze Buddha (commonly known as the "Prince Buddha," which came from India more than two thousand years ago), he requested that Yuanzhao be ordered to compensate the plaintiff for damages of one hundred thousand yuan and to maintain the ancient temple, etc. After the defendant Yuanzhao was arrested by the Municipal Public Security Bureau, he was transferred to the court for investigation along with the evidence. Subsequently, the monk Minfeng also filed a complaint with the procuratorate of the local court accusing Yuanzhao of dismantling the Hongshan Temple (opposite the Nanli School on the west side of the Great South Gate on Zhonghua Road), rebuilding it into city housing for rent collection, and moving all the Buddha statues to Longhua Temple for worship. It was found that this temple property was built by the old monk Guangjian, the master of the temple, who had spent many years striking a wooden fish and soliciting donations. At that time, the city walls had not yet been demolished, and all the temple foundations were kept by the benefactor Mo Zijing at the entrance of the Great South Gate. After the old monk passed away, the temple foundations were taken back by Yuanzhao from the Mo family. In 1930, when I returned from offering incense on the mountain, I saw that the Bodhisattvas in the temple had been moved away. When I questioned him, Yuanzhao replied that it was because the market was not good, so he rebuilt the houses for rent. I strongly opposed this, so I sued the benefactor Lin Kanghou and summoned Yuanzhao to Lin's residence for questioning. Yuanzhao still claimed that the market was not good, so he rebuilt more than twenty houses. Now, Yuanzhao's nephew-in-law, Yan Wanglong, is collecting rent for these houses (Yan lives at No. 2, Fu'an Lane, which was newly built). He demanded that the temple be restored to its original state and that the Bodhisattvas be moved back, etc. Prosecutor Wu Deying conducted a clear investigation and filed a lawsuit in the criminal court, which held a trial that was not concluded. At 2:00 PM yesterday, Judge Shao Qinzhi specially opened the third court for a continued trial. Xingkong did not attend due to illness and was represented by his lawyer Pan Zhensheng, who presented the previous facts. Minfeng and his lawyer Lu Qi also arrived in court one after another. The interrogating official ordered the detained Yuanzhao to be brought to the case and asked, "How far has your civil appeal case progressed?" Yuanzhao replied, "The Suzhou Higher Court held a hearing and rejected the appeal, upholding the first-instance judgment." He asked where Yan Wanglong lived. Yuanzhao replied, "Yan lives at No. 2, Fu'an Lane, opposite the Nanli School at the Great South Gate (the old site of Hongshan Temple)." He asked, "How many ancient bronze Buddhas are there in Longhua Temple?" Yuanzhao replied, "There is only one Vairocana Buddha, no Prince Buddha." The official said, "This ten-thousand-year record states that there are two. Did you sell the Prince Buddha?" He replied, "The bureau has sent staff to the temple to prove that there are indeed two ancient bronze Buddhas, so how can I argue?" The interrogating official briefly questioned Minfeng and ordered, "We will schedule a date to order Yan Wanglong, Lu Mingzhao, and Xingkong to come to court for further verification." Yuanzhao requested bail in court, but the official refused and ordered him to be returned to custody to await further instructions.</p>

<h3>The Harmony of Golden Arrow Pitch-Pot</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Guohuo Company, located across from the Hong Temple on Nanjing Road, Shanghai, is holding the elegant game of "Golden Arrow Pitch-Pot" with grand prizes. Mr. Wang Pingnan has composed a five-character poem to arouse the enthusiasm of the Chinese people to love and use domestic products. The poem reads, "Incline to award nine ranks, draw the arrow and pitch to the pot, watch skillful hands, support domestic goods together." It is indeed a realistic depiction. Now, a recluse named Songshidaoren has sent a responding poem, which reads, "Europeanization and extravagance are excessive, why this pitch-pot? Now seeking Xu Zi, weaving and farming are good to support each other." After receiving the poem, the Shanghai Guohuo Company immediately wrote it in large characters and hung it at the Golden Arrow Pitch-Pot location to inspire contemplation. From this, poets echoing each other will surely find great interest. It is heard that the company's publicity authorities will select outstanding works and present gifts, truly implementing the elegance of cooperation between domestic goods and talented individuals.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, I am writing on behalf of my client, Ms. Shi Lanxuan, who claims that her husband, Gao Gongmao, accompanied factory owner Ma Xiongguan out by car from the factory at 10 a.m. on the 19th of this month. While passing in front of St. Mary's Girls' School on Route Ghisi, they encountered bandits who kidnapped her husband. The news of this case reported in the newspapers the following day is completely inconsistent with the facts and greatly affects her reputation. The points of disagreement are listed separately below. Please have your lawyer forward this letter to the newspapers for correction. I am writing to inform you of the situation and hope you will investigate and publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" column to clarify the truth. Thank you in advance. Sincerely, Lawyer Yu Xiangqin, January 21st.</p>
<p>Appendix: Points of disagreement with your newspaper's report are as follows: (1) Gao Gongmao's former wife was named Chen, and they had a son named Yingmin. After Ms. Chen passed away, Shi Lanxuan and Gao Gongmao were introduced by Yang Huanzhang and Pan Xiangde in the summer of the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932). They held a formal wedding at the Sutai Inn in Shanghai, which was known to all relatives and friends. The report that Shi Lanxuan is Gao's mistress is a complete fabrication. (2) After the kidnapping occurred, Gao Shi, along with her relatives and friends, Mr. Pan, etc., reported the matter to the Sixth Branch of the Public Security Bureau. The head of the detective team of the bureau, Geng Shoushi, inquired in detail about the circumstances of Gao's kidnapping and the family situation. They then went to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station to report the matter. They were not detained for questioning. The report that Shi was suspected and taken to the headquarters for questioning, as well as other ambiguous remarks, is even more fictitious. (3) Gao Shi graduated from Hangzhou Women's Normal School. She is naturally chaste and quiet. She has worked at the Toyota Textile Factory for more than ten years and is highly regarded by the factory. The report that she is naturally flirtatious and is known as a female tycoon is intended to insult her.</p>

<h3>Little West Heaven</h3>
<p>— By Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Eight: Remote Place, Light Official, Strong-Willed Magistrate Comes; Extravagant Banquet, Outside There Are Pitiful Worms</p>
<p>Therefore, smiling, he said, "With Mr. Cheng's extensive social circle in Xi'an, from the Chairman down to the various department heads and bureau chiefs, there isn't one he doesn't know. Why not find a position in this province? It would be much more leisurely than in the education field." Cheng Zhiqian smiled and said, "That's because everyone's interests are different. My personality is not suited to being an official. Besides, when we don't need anything from people, the Chairman, department heads, and bureau chiefs are all friends. But once you go to ask for something, they're no longer friends." Zhang Jiefu was silent, smiled, and then said, "I heard that Director Gao of the Construction Department here is very close to Mr. Cheng." Zhiqian said, "We only met after I came to Xi'an." Zhang Jiefu smiled and said, "He's very accommodating to Mr. Cheng!" Zhiqian understood that he must have found out about Gao Hefeng's treat, so he smiled and said, "Yes, I'll be bothering him for another meal tomorrow. But I'm just accompanying someone; he's not specifically inviting me." Zhang Jiefu had something he wanted to say, but he couldn't bring himself to say it abruptly. He just looked distracted and stared blankly at the table. Under his gaze, he noticed a slip of paper. The slip of paper read, "Zhu Yueying, seventeen years old, originally from Hengzhou, Hunan. Lived in Gansu for three generations. Now fleeing for her life to Xi'an, seeking to sell herself as a concubine. Has a widowed mother and grandmother, both living with her uncle, never having a full meal all day long." It was just a passage like that, with no introductory or closing remarks, not like a resume, nor like a letter. Cheng Zhiqian knew that he was paying attention to it, so he smiled and said, "Mr. Zhang is looking at this slip of paper, and doesn't quite understand what it's about, right?" Zhang Jiefu wasn't really paying attention to the slip of paper, but since he was asked, he could only smile and answer, "That's right. This girl's appearance is not bad either. Someone with Mr. Cheng's status, taking a new concubine here, that's nothing at all. Why not spend a few dollars to rescue her from her misery?" Cheng Zhiqian smiled and said, "If I had that kind of extravagant desire, I wouldn't need to come to Xi'an to take a concubine. In Shanghai, in Beiping, the opportunities are probably too numerous to count." (118)</p>
<h3>A Small Talk on Fried Dough Sticks</h3>
<p>— Wang Shapa</p>
<p>Fried dough sticks, everyone knows are a commoner's food! Every time I watch the staff in the pancake shop, rubbing the alkali-water-leavened flour into two small strips, then putting the two strips together, stirring them a few times, and sending them into a pot of boiling oil, they will immediately expand, the short ones become long, the thin ones become thick, the solid ones also become hollow, it's quite interesting.</p>
<p>It is said that these fried dough sticks originated in the Yue Wu Mu era of the Song Dynasty, because Yue Fei was killed by Qin Hui using trickery. At that time, the people deeply loved Yue Fei's loyalty and deeply hated Qin Hui's wickedness. Therefore, later, after Qin Hui died, the people made human figures out of flour, treated them as Qin Hui's corpse, and put them into boiling oil to fry, as a memorial to the uncorrupted loyalty of the virtuous official, even though it is unfounded hearsay, it is quite reasonable.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I happened to hear a comedian on the radio singing a pancake and fried dough stick song: "Pancake and fried dough sticks, pancake and fried dough sticks, blow the wheat flower! Blow the wheat flower! Three copper coins for one, three copper coins for one, hurry up and buy. Hurry up and buy." It's really unique?</p>
<p>Fried dough sticks are indeed fragrant and delicious when they are hot, but they have no taste when they are cold. However, there is also a way to eat them cold. Break the fried dough sticks into pieces, put them in a bowl, add a little soy sauce and monosodium glutamate, and pour boiling water over them, and it is also very delicious.</p>
<h3>Two Brothers</h3>
<p>— Wu Yakai</p>
<p>"Evening paper, want to see the newly published evening paper!" This hoarse voice appears on the streets whenever the sun sets. Every day, this voice also passes by my ears probably thousands of times.</p>
<p>—That's the shout of life! It's the cry of life! I imagined.</p>
<p>These are two children selling evening newspapers, one thirteen years old, one eleven years old, they are two brothers, the evening newspaper I read is delivered by them; so every day I always strike up a few conversations with them, this has almost become my habit, so I learned from their mouths about their living conditions.</p>
<p>Their home is in Gaoyou, and since their hometown was flooded by the heavy rain the year before last, they came to Shanghai with their parents. His father pulled a rickshaw, and his mother sometimes went to knock stones, and their family lived in Zhabei. Although life was very hard, they were still able to get by. But things were so unfortunate, their father lost his life in the January 28th Incident! Although they escaped from the dangerous situation with their mother, they were initially rescued into a refugee camp, and after the ceasefire agreement, they lost their basis.</p>
<p>One day, two days, three days, time is like lightning flashing before their eyes, and their lives have been passed through their hard struggles. The section of North Sichuan Road Bridge is the territory of their two brothers' struggle for life, so once evening arrives, this hoarse cry of selling newspapers is filled with the surroundings; when I wake up, at twelve o'clock in the middle of the night, I will often hear this cry of life! Whether it's sunny or rainy, summer or winter, in the northwest wind or in heavy snow, they have never interrupted a day.</p>
<p>They have not been educated, but a heavy burden of life has already been placed on their shoulders. They have not enjoyed the blessings of ordinary children. At such a young age, they have already jumped out of their loving mother's arms and embarked on the path of life; therefore, many traces of their life's blood have been imprinted on this bank of North Sichuan Road Bridge.</p>
<h3>Slow Pace</h3>
<h3>Night Visit to Tianning Temple (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Huo Xueming</p>
<p>"Yes, I drank a little too much wine, it's really cold."</p>
<p>"Let's go to the temple quickly, there are fire basins there!"</p>
<p>So I followed the monk, and under the lamplight, crossed the mountain gate. The barking dog had also tamed down and was now snuggling in front of me, wagging its tail. How big the statues of the Four Heavenly Kings were, of course, I couldn't tell, even the outline of the main gate was buried in the black dye vat.</p>
<p>The hemp shoes of the lamp-holding monk stepped on the fallen leaves in the empty courtyard, making rustling sounds. I deliberately lagged behind five or six steps, wanting to see the swaying red lantern, the monk's robes in the lamplight, and a loyal dog. Oh! This is simply a piece of poetic material that is so quiet it can't be quieter!</p>
<p>When the moon escaped the cloud pile, we happened to walk onto the long corridor on the east side of the Great Hero Hall. Looking back at the trees filled in the courtyard, they were so vigorously stretching their heads in the mercury-like moonlight, without a sound, only one or two remaining leaves fluttering down.</p>
<p>The whole temple has many winding corridors, and the corridors are brightly lit with electric lights. The monk extinguished the lantern and still led me into his friend's bedroom. Walking past the Sutra Hall, incense smoke lingered, bells and drums rang together, and three eminent monks were seated on the altar, performing a water and land ritual. With thirty or fifty novices accompanying them, it was truly moving to hear in the deep night!</p>
<p>Slightly stopping, glancing around, then following through rooms and doors, I did not expect my friend to be sitting on a futon in a guest hall chanting scriptures. When the two met, they were naturally ecstatic, almost forgetting to send the lamp-holding monk back. When I saw my friend's plump face, lively movements, and talkative manner, I couldn't help but feel relieved.</p>
<p>That night, needless to say, neither of us wanted to sleep. We talked about everything, appraised wine, and discussed poetry, until dawn. Looking at the charcoal ash in the fire basin, piled up high, we did not know that the rain was blowing outside, and the flower beds were full of accumulated water! (The End)</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Worrying for the Country)</p>
<p>In the toy store, I saw many different kinds of masks hanging. My friend said to me: These many masks can represent the faces of the people in the world, and this toy store can represent the entire world. After listening to his words, I found it very humorous and meaningful.</p>
<p>Those who are not engaged are desperately trying to pursue the opposite sex. Those who are engaged are desperately trying to get married quickly. Those who are married are desperately trying to get rid of the bondage.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Talk</p>
<h3>Leisurely Writings After Painting</h3>
<p>— A Single Leaf</p>
<p>The excellence of calligraphy and painting mounting began with Fan, and the publication of special collections of painters began with Shen Zhou (Shen Shitian); Li Yu's "Mustard Seed Garden Manual of Painting" was widely circulated, becoming the best painting manual of ancient and modern times.</p>
<p>Jin Nong (Jin Dongxin) often painted plum blossoms with dense branches and abundant blossoms, showing his love for holistic beauty, sharing the same perspective as Gong Zizhen (Gong Ding’an), who wrote "Record of a Sick Plum Studio."</p>
<p>Qiu Ying (Qiu Shizhou) was a first-rate painter of the Ming Dynasty, but because he came from a lacquer artisan background, he did not understand inscriptions, so his paintings were greatly despised by the literati of the time. Wang Shimin was a master of painting in the early Qing Dynasty, but because his learning was not very high, people considered his works to lack the spirit of scholarship, thus reducing his reputation. Only a society dominated by literati-bureaucrat painters would have this strange phenomenon, which ultimately harmed art. It is a pity that pure painting was discriminated against, and true artists were crucified for lacking scholarly spirit.</p>
<p>"Foot-high mountains, inch-high trees, bean-sized people, and horse-sized horses." This is probably the beginning of the scientific proportion method in Chinese painting.</p>
<p>Wang Mo first splashed ink on the silk, following the shape and spreading it, while Zhang Zao held two brushes, moving them simultaneously, one for living branches and one for dead branches, both seeking new paths in technique.</p>
<p>Although the way the Japanese scholar Ōmura Seigai divides artistic trends in his book "History of Chinese Art" by dynasty is a flaw, it is truly shameful that we do not create a respectable art history of our own but instead bask in the light of foreigners. I heard that this old man is very old, but his research spirit is astonishing. Ten years ago, upon hearing of the discovery of Yang Hui's works, he rushed to Jiaozhi Town in Suzhou to see Yang Hui's sculpted Arhat statues and, after returning to his country, published a book titled "Miraculous Sculpted Walls and Remaining Shadows of Wujun," prefacing it with a detailed and lengthy study of over ten thousand words. Generally, not only do we Chinese rely on foreigners to provide artistic literature, but we also depend on foreigners to preserve and research our artworks. One can see this from the fact that the director of the Palace Museum ran away after being accused of stealing antiques, and that the Buddhist statues in Yungang, Shanxi, were destroyed because a certain commander wanted to build a villa.</p>
<p>Zhang Yanyuan once mocked Du Fu for knowing poetry but not understanding painting, failing to recognize the true artistic value of Han Gan, causing his masterpiece, the famous horse of Emperor Xuanzong's imperial stable, renowned as the best horse painter of all time, to be ridiculed as "painted meat." If Old Du knew, he would nod in agreement. I remember that a few years ago, some "expert" who claimed to not understand art but wanted to write art criticism articles caused an advertising war among several master painters. Art criticism, indeed!</p>
<p>Kushiro Hakuson said: "Appreciating art is exactly like being infatuated with a woman, there must be a perfect match in temperament between the subject and oneself." I believe that not only should the appreciator feel this way about the artwork, but the artist should also feel this way about the object of creation, evoking a passionate resonance between the feelings and life of both, only then will there be an artist, and only then will there be an art critic.</p>
<p>"Build six old huts firmly, knowing your brush's trace, not seeking thousands of streams, only wanting two or three pines, leaving a flat stone under the tree, allowing distant peaks at the edge of the sky, in the humid darkness near the rock, relying solely on the depth of ink." This is a poem by the monk Dayu begging Jing Hao for a painting. He not only used poetry as money but also listed everything he wanted in the painting, but artists are not merchants and cannot fulfill orders according to a list. Art sometimes becomes a commodity, but the artist's mind is fundamentally not a machine.</p>
<p>The origin of commercial art lies in the fact that in late eighteenth-century France, painters painted signboards for surgeons.</p>
<p>Giotto herded sheep in the mountains as a child, and only after Cimabue took him back to the studio to learn painting did he later become a pioneer of the Renaissance and the founder of the Florentine school of painting. Xiao Zhao of the Song Dynasty, who drifted into Taihang during the Jingkang Incident and became a bandit, one day robbed Li Tang. Seeing that his luggage only contained painting materials, he followed Li south. During the Shaoxing era, he obtained the position of painter-in-waiting in the Painting Academy. The origins of ancient great painters were so extraordinary, but without opportunity and artistic talent, their development would probably have been impossible.</p>
<h3>Records of Lingering Fragrance</h3>
<p>— Originally by Princess Der Ling of Qing, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Originally: It was almost lunchtime, so I knew that today's lunch would have a different taste. However, we didn't really eat cold rice; the Empress Dowager explained to us,</p>
<p>"But this is ultimately a ritual; our intention is only to remember the virtues of our ancestors. So, long ago, a flexible method was decided upon, not really using cold rice, but using other cold foods as a substitute."</p>
<p>So we were all busy trying to see what was in the food box. When we opened it, we saw several plates of Shandong raw vegetables that had been washed but not cooked. Their leaves were broad and the color was very white and tender, so their taste would surely be good! There were also several plates of meat sauce. The Empress Dowager first took a leaf of raw vegetable and ordered Zhang De to hold up the meat sauce so that she could pick some herself, put it on the vegetable, and roll it into a cylindrical shape with her fingers, chewing it slowly. We were all very envious, and when she said, "You can eat too," we rushed to grab some, stuffing our mouths. Ah! The taste was truly excellent! The raw vegetables were both fleshy and tender, and the meat sauce was even more savory than any other kind of meat sauce because it contained chicken and pigeon meat. Besides, we had been busy playing for so long since early morning and had been strolling in the fresh air, so our appetites were greatly opened, making this cold meal taste particularly delicious. It was truly indescribably delicious!</p>
<p>This day was as satisfying as yesterday's playing at the Fox Fairy Pagoda. For the Empress Dowager herself, such an interesting holiday was rare, and for us, it was even more so, especially because when she was happy, her face was often covered in smiles, and we felt that life was much better!

<h3>Shanghai Basketball Association Opens, Meiling Defeats Zhenru</h3>
<p>Donghua Overwhelms Dongya</p>
<p>Qingguang Defeats Jewish</p>
<p>The Shanghai Basketball Association opened its basketball hall in Shen Garden last night. Three to four hundred spectators attended, making it quite lively. All three Class A matches were one-sided affairs. The most noteworthy was the Donghua team. The three tigers of Shanghai College, Feng Nianhua, Qian Jingyong, and Sun Baoqing, were previously unable to join the Western Youth Basketball Tournament due to school regulations. Now, they have reunited with veteran players Lu Zhongen and Chen Xianglong, which is especially noteworthy. In Class A, the Meiling team is the most tenacious. In the Western Youth tournament, they acted wildly, monopolizing the champion and runner-up spots. It is expected that they will be able to compete with those two teams, with Donghua being the one to compete for dominance. Yesterday, they overwhelmed Dongya with a score of 59 to 15, with plenty to spare. Qingguang revived, defeating Jewish with a score of 44 to 18. Meiling once again defeated Zhenru with a score of 51 to 23. There are four matches tonight, with the following schedule:</p>

<h3>Qingguang Defeats Jewish (Class A/B)</h3>
<p>The Qingguang and Jewish teams played in the opening match of the Shanghai Basketball Association. In the initial battle, the Jewish team showed some promise. Gortkin received a pass from the center and scored first. Tan of Qingguang kept pace, twice tying the score at 4-4 and 8-8. From then on, Qu, Wu, Tan, Dong, and others gradually contributed, and the score soared. On the Jewish side, a sense of helplessness emerged, leading to a one-sided situation. At the end of the first half, Qingguang led 22 to 9. In the end, Qingguang achieved a victorious start with a score of 44 to 18.</p>

<h3>Donghua Defeats Dongya (Class A/A)</h3>
<p>The Donghua team is composed of outstanding talents from Shanghai College and St. John's University. They are all veterans who have fought on the battlefield for a long time and are known for their delicate passing and connection. Their defense and dodging are precise and smooth. The Dongya warriors lacked movement, so under the confrontation, the overall situation was controlled by Donghua. The comparison on the scoreboard grew wider. The Dongya players were very difficult to manage in this intense and tense situation. Among them, the monk's head, Pan Chengbin, was the bravest. Although both the left and right forwards were not weak, the backs were too weak, allowing the Donghua forwards to roam freely, resulting in an irredeemable battle situation. After forty minutes, Donghua won by a large margin of 59 to 15.</p>

<h3>Meiling Defeats Zhenru (Class A/A)</h3>
<p>The last battle was between Meiling and Zhenru. Meiling relied on Locke's unparalleled bravery, and the entire team was well connected, so Zhenru's basket was frequently taken advantage of. Although the warriors tried again and again, they were inevitably rusty due to the current exam period, so from beginning to end, they were out of reach. In the first half, Meiling took the lead with a high score of 24 to 9. In the second half, the Zhenru athletes tried hard to recover their lost ground, but the opponent did not let up, resulting in a battle where the heart was willing but the strength was insufficient. As a result, they were defeated with a score of 23 to 51.</p>

<h3>Western Youth Women's Basketball Liangjiang Achieves Double Victory</h3>
<p>Women's Preliminary Test of Men's Tactics</p>
<p>Mediocre Skill, Not Much Excitement</p>
<p>The Western Youth Women's Basketball Association opened last night. This year, due to the trial use of men's rules, there are fewer courageous participants. Only the Liangjiang Class A and B teams have registered among the Chinese teams, making it even more difficult to summon more. Compared to the crowded situation in previous years, one cannot help but lament the changes between now and then. Liangjiang Class A has hopes of winning the championship, but under the intense impact of the men's rules, their shooting still needs in-depth research and practice. Yesterday, the school had a double celebration. The results are as follows: (1) Liangjiang A defeats Meiling (Class A) 34 to 3. (2) Liangjiang B defeats Hanfengli (Class B) 11 to 7.</p>
<h3>Class A Team Largely Defeats Meiling</h3>
<p>Meiling's Jie Dali took the lead by making a free throw, showing great momentum. When Chen Rongming made a free throw, he scored another point. In the first quarter, Liangjiang reluctantly secured a score of 1 to 2. In the second quarter, Liangjiang suddenly jumped ahead, with Rongming and Pan Meng increasing the score to 9 to 2. However, Chen was penalized and sent off the court at this time due to four fouls. The first half ended with a score of 14 to 2. In the third quarter, Jie Dali made another free throw, but unfortunately, he followed in Chen Rongming's footsteps. He was the most fierce and skilled player on the team, and from then on, the overall situation was lost. Liangjiang scored 24 to 3. In the final quarter, the game was one-sided, and Liangjiang won by a large margin of 34 to 3.</p>

<p>Second Half: Liangjiang 20, Meiling 1 point</p>
<h3>Class B Team Defeats Hanbili</h3>
<p>It was not easy to score in the first half. The actions were flustered, and there were many jokes. In the first quarter, Liangjiang's Su Tingbiao made a free throw to win 1-0. The first half ended with a score of 5-3. The situation was average in the third quarter, and the score reached 9-5. In the end, Liangjiang won 11-7. However, the technique of their Class B team is immature and far inferior to that of their older sisters (Class A).</p>

<h3>Chen Guofu Expresses Opinions on the Ten Professors' Declaration</h3>
<p>Agrees with the Principle of China-Centricity</p>
<p>Shanghai News reporters have learned from certain sources that Chen Guofu, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, has expressed his opinion on the recent declaration of China-centric cultural construction by ten professors. He stated that he fully supports basing the national cultural construction on China, and believes that if efforts are made in this direction, it will undoubtedly open a new path for the Chinese nation.</p>
<h3>Chen Zhuzun's Letter to He Bingsong and Chen Gaoyong</h3>
<p>To Mr. Bicheng and Mr. Gaoyong:</p>
<p>I received your esteemed invitation yesterday and had the opportunity to hear your insightful discussions, which I greatly admired. Unfortunately, I was feeling unwell and could not accompany you to the end of the meeting, and thus could not fully hear the wise opinions of the esteemed gentlemen, which I deeply regret. I hope you will understand. Your opinions and propositions are truly essential for saving the country today. Promoting restoration of the old ways is not advisable, and advocating for blind imitation of foreign ways is even more undesirable. It seems that our most crucial task today is to engage in comparative discussions of Chinese and foreign cultures. Which aspects of Chinese culture should be retained, which should be discarded, which should be restored, and which are irrelevant to gains and losses? Which aspects of foreign culture should be learned, which should not be learned, which should be pursued urgently, and which should be approached gradually? This should be thoroughly listed, from politics and education to customs and habits, so that our countrymen can follow. For example, in terms of education, the past emphasis on respecting teachers and valuing the Way fostered close relationships between teachers and students, like those between parents and children, and should be retained. However, the practice of schoolteachers flogging students, which harms children's physical development, must be abolished. Recently, there has been a gradual adoption of Western ways, and the relationship between teachers and students is almost like that between merchants. I have never studied in Europe or America, so I do not know if this is true. If it is, it seems that it should not be imitated. In terms of family, the practice of parents acting as mere custodians of wealth for their children, and children relying solely on their parents' inheritance, should be abolished. However, I have heard that in America, even if a mother raises a chicken, she will ask for the price of the chicken, and if parents own a house, their children must pay rent for it. This should not be imitated. All of these things should be compared and discussed in detail, without fear of being too meticulous, to avoid the extreme pitfalls of blindly adhering to the past or blindly embracing the new. Moreover, the public's trust and patriotism should be urgently and widely promoted and encouraged. Let me give a few examples. For instance, Chinese people call Western cuisine "big cuisine" and Chinese cuisine "small cuisine," and Western Jiang shipping companies refer to Western restaurants as first-class restaurants and Chinese restaurants as second-class restaurants. Thus, it can be inferred that psychologically, they are willing to treat Westerners as superiors and consider themselves inferior, and willing to regard foreign countries as first-class countries and consider themselves second- or third-class countries. Rickshaw pullers in Shanghai know about Great Britain but do not know about China, and porters in Hong Kong regard the British as royalty but do not know about China. They have long ceased to identify themselves as Chinese. Of course, this is largely due to the high rate of illiteracy, but as a short-term solution, we must rely on widespread promotion and advocacy. Otherwise, the infiltration of servility will become increasingly ingrained, and the consequences will be unimaginable. Foreign culture should not only be accepted by our country, but we should also quickly catch up and embrace it. However, what is urgently needed today is Western science, not Western enjoyment. But in our country today, the opposite is true. In terms of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, we strive to imitate the West, but we neglect the science that is fundamental to Western civilization, and the countryside becomes increasingly bankrupt. I have lamented that in this age, if we do not change our current practices, we cannot prevent the country from perishing. Therefore, promoting Western science and advocating for the simplicity of the past are also essential tasks today. I am unsure if my opinions are correct in any way, but I have presented my humble views and respectfully request your guidance. I would be most grateful.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Chen Zhu, January 20th.</p>

<h3>Currency Exchange Rates Aiding the Increase in Selling Pressure; Spot Gold Price Dips Slightly by 2.9 Yuan</h3>
<p>Short Selling Increases to Sixty-Seven Firms</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw a rather strong selling atmosphere due to the foreign exchange market's inability to rally, attributed to selling by Sassoon and others. Despite consecutive rises in Indian silver, it ultimately fell. Trading volume throughout the day was limited, and market conditions remained tranquil. Although the Central Bank opened for cash transactions, its impact was minimal. Early in the morning, overseas silver markets in both England and the United States were stable, while forward silver prices in Monte Negro slightly declined. Exchange rates saw a slight increase, and London spot gold fell by 1.5 pence. Off-exchange forward trading opened slightly steady at 71 yuan per tael, largely due to reports of a U.S. congressman proposing a shift to an independent silver standard. However, local foreign exchange rates had retreated to within one jiao, easing credit conditions and stabilizing sentiment. Subsequently, the Central Bank's official rates were announced, with both English and American rates remaining unchanged. The Customs Gold Unit fell by 0.2%, and the spot gold standard price retreated to 992.2 yuan. Buyers took the opportunity to sell at the high, causing it to retreat to within 70 yuan. The opening was lackluster, and after opening, bank selling appetite was normal. Although there were offers, it was difficult to conclude transactions initially, and it rose to above 70 yuan. However, due to continued supply at the high, it soon retreated back to within 70 yuan. Thereafter, banks continued to supply, and Sassoon also showed selling interest, causing a slight weakening. But due to strong support from major clients at the low, the overall trend remained stable. Subsequently, the Central Bank, through Da De Cheng, released 280 taels of cash at a price of 960.5 yuan, causing a slight surge in buying and a minor rise. The announcement of the silver equalization tax remained unchanged at 6%, calculated at one shilling five pence seven one eight seven five, with little impact. Although there was a slight decline from stability in the subsequent session, demand remained robust. The noon closing saw a recovery. Although the afternoon market opened flat, the lack of recovery in the foreign exchange market ultimately led to a feeling of fatigue. Sassoon continued to show selling interest, coupled with two increases in Indian silver, totaling 4.46 anna, stimulating selling pressure and gradually declining. Finally, due to banks taking advantage of cheap prices and major clients maintaining support at the low, it gradually stabilized again. As a result, it ultimately rebounded, with the swap premium remaining around 7 yuan. The day's market conditions are recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 969.7 yuan, a slight increase of 0.2 yuan from last Saturday. It gradually trended downward, with Fu Xing Yong, Da Fa Yong selling off, falling to 69.4 yuan. Heng Yu, Da De Cheng, Zhao Feng Chang took in taels, and the foreign exchange market was slightly tight, gradually rising to 70.07 yuan. Da Fa Yong, Fu Yu sold, retreating to 69.1 yuan. Chun Yuan Yong advanced fiercely, rising to 9.9 yuan. Mitsui released March US dollars at 4375, and Qing Yu Yuan, Da Fa Yong, Shen Kang, etc., sold off, falling to 8.2 yuan. HSBC's official rate also remained unchanged, and the overall trend remained stable. Later, with Fu Xing Yong and Da De Cheng's efforts to maintain support, it rose to around 9 yuan. Fu Xing Yong sold off at the high, and Yuan Mao Yong also sold, retreating to 8.2 yuan. Da De Cheng actively bought in, and the Central Bank released 280 taels of cash at a price of 960.5 yuan, transacted through Da De Cheng, rising to above 9 yuan. The announcement of the silver equalization tax kept it relatively stable, hovering around 9 yuan. Later, due to the Dalian gang and Yuan Mao Yong and Shun Mao taking in taels, it rose from 8.6 yuan to 9.4 yuan. Fu Xing Yong, Da De Cheng, Heng Yu, etc., sold taels, retreating to 8.5 yuan. Da De Cheng, Qian Chang Xiang, Qing Yu, Shen Kang, Tong Tai Chang, etc., aggressively bought in taels, gradually rising, until the noon closing at 969.7 yuan, and the market was flat and tired after the close.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 969.8 yuan, then 9.9 yuan. Wan Xing, Da De Cheng, Yu Li, Heng Long, and Fu Yu sold off. Although Da Fa Yong bought in, Sassoon released March US dollars at 5625, falling to within 9 yuan. Fu Xing Yong, Heng Yu, Yuan Yi took in taels, rising to 9.5 yuan. The initial report of Indian silver was up 3.35 anna, and at this time it was still stable, largely because there were few sellers in the market, and the falling trend was difficult to initiate. By the time Yi Feng Yong aggressively sold, Jin Long, Xin Chang, Fu Tai Heng, and Da Fa Yong sold taels one after another, and Indian silver increased again by 1.11 anna, falling to 6.5 yuan. Yi Feng Yong, Rui Xing, Dalian gang, Yuan Mao Yong, Da Kang all took advantage of the low prices to buy in, rising to 7.7 yuan. Da Fa Yong, Yu Li, Hui Xiang, Heng Yu continued to sell, and Sassoon once blocked March shillings at five pence, falling to 6.1 yuan. Shun Li, Wan Xing, Fu Xing Yong, Da Da Cheng, and Shen Kang maintained spot gold, scalping March US dollars at 625, rising to 7.1 yuan. Fu Xing Yong, Yi Feng Yong, Da Fa Yong continued to supply, and the closing price retreated to 966.6 yuan, and Yuan Mao Yong and Da Fa Yong were still selling after the close, and were relatively tired. It was found that the highest price of the day was 970.7 yuan, and the lowest price was 966.1 yuan, a difference of 4.6 yuan. As a result, it fell 2.9 yuan compared with last Saturday.</p>
<p>The settlement price was based on the Central Bank's spot gold standard price, which retreated to 992.2 yuan. According to the closing price, it was approximately 25 yuan lower than the listing price, 2 yuan more than last Saturday. The February registration price was 963 yuan, and the March price was 970 yuan. The morning margin call was 953 yuan, and the afternoon margin call was 950 yuan. The price of pure gold was 969.7 yuan, and spot market conditions were stable. The Tianjin gang sold 100 taels to Da Feng Heng, with an additional 4 yuan. Thereafter, both demand and supply were quiet. The Central Bank released 280 taels of cash at a price of 960.5 yuan, which was sold by Da De Cheng. Many long positions at Fu Chang were still willing to pay the swap premium, and the overall trend was very stable. Initially, Da Da paid Yuan Chang Yong 7 taels at 7.3 yuan, Heng Yu paid Yuan Chang Yong 112 taels, Heng Xing 7 taels at 7.2 yuan, Heng Yu paid Qian Chang Xiang 105 taels, Heng Xing 7 taels at 7.1 yuan, and Xiang Feng paid Ding Chang 42 taels at the same price. Later, Heng Yu paid Yuan Yi 56 taels at 7.2 yuan, and Jia Tai paid Zheng Chang Xiang 14 taels at 7 yuan. There were still 4,207 February taels remaining, totaling 21 long positions and 25 short positions.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was normal, and short selling increased rapidly. In summary, Da De Cheng, Fu Xing Yong, Rui Ding Kang, Heng Xing, Yuan Yong De, Tong Tai Chang, Yi Cheng, Yuan Mao Yong, Heng Chang Yong, and Wan Feng Xing Shun Li were on the buy-side. Da Fa Yong, Zhao Feng Chang, Da Chang Xiang, Tian Feng Heng Yu, Yu Xin Xiang, Tong Feng Heng, Qian Chang Xiang, Yuan Chang Yong, and Hui Xiang were on the sell-side. Da Fa Yong, Yi Feng Yong, and Qing Fa Yong Heng Yu went from in to out, and Fu Xing Yong Yuan Yi Wan Xing went from out to in. The Dalian gang and Wan Xing traded a total of over 700 taels, netting in just over 100. Shun Li traded a total of over 800 taels, netting in around 400. The Guangdong gang Sheng Da Heng Xing still lacked significant inflows and outflows. The total number of transactions on that day was 11,263 taels in the morning, 10,668 taels in the afternoon, and 20,321 taels of March futures, totaling 50 long positions and 67 short positions, an increase.</p>
<h3>Sassoon's Selling of Foreign Exchange Finally Leads to Market Hardening</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's report from foreign banks in London, both near and far-term rates were flat. New York silver prices remained unchanged, and Monte Negro forward silver prices remained unchanged or decreased by no more than 0.1%. London spot gold fell by 1.5 pence, the British pound rose 0.125 against the US dollar, the US dollar rose 0.25 against the British pound, the British pound was unchanged against the French franc, and the US dollar rose 0.25 against the French franc. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with near-term selling rates of one shilling five pence one eight seven five for the British pound and 35 yuan for the US dollar. Compared with last Saturday, both the British pound and US dollar remained unchanged. The Central Bank's official rates were announced, with both English and American rates remaining flat. The Customs Gold Unit decreased by 0.2%, with little impact. Banks offered sales, but the appetite for selling was not strong. As a result, there was a slight tightening after the opening. HSBC's official rates were announced, with both English and American rates remaining flat. At this time, Sassoon and others offered US dollars, but banks maintained considerable support. The announcement of the silver equalization tax remained unchanged. Thereafter, banks engaged in mutual transactions, and the situation was mediocre, trending towards dullness. It was difficult for changes to occur until noon, and the underlying trend had already loosened. In the afternoon, the Shanghai Bank took advantage of cheap prices to continue buying, allowing for support. However, with Sassoon continuing to sell, it was difficult to see any recovery. After entering the market, Indian silver increased successively by a total of 4.46 anna, and the market hardened somewhat. However, banks took advantage of cheap prices to buy. At the close of trading, near-term selling rates were one shilling five pence two five for the British pound and 35 yuan one two five for the US dollar. Compared to last Saturday, the British pound loosened by 0.0625, and the US dollar loosened by 0.125. Chinese merchants initially bought and then sold, and net scalpers were still buying in. Sassoon actively sold off both the British pound and US dollar, but banks were willing to maintain support by taking advantage of cheap prices.</p>
<p>The British pound opened in the morning with a near-term selling rate of one shilling five pence one eight seven five. Macgregor blocked June at 4.75 pence, Mitsui sold to Dongfang in the same month at the same price, Holland sold spot goods to Zhejiang at 5.25 pence, Sassoon sold to Zhengjin in January at the same price, Huayi issued to Huabi in January at 25 pence, Anda sold to Zhengjin in March at 4.9375 pence, Huabi sold to Jiaotong in January at 5.25 pence, Dongfang sold to Mitsui in February at 0.0625, Macgregor issued to Huabi in the same month at the same price, Citibank bought in March at 5 pence, Huabi issued to block April at 4.875 pence.

<h3>Interbank Lending Rate Returns to a High of One Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday's silver dollar market conditions were such that, because it was the beginning of the week, banks were all carrying out clearing procedures, which caused the situation to suddenly become firmer. The market price of foreign exchange interbank lending therefore also increased by four fen. Both the morning and noon markets did one jiao, and the interest rate was raised, in order to resolve the issue of banks having too much money and not having enough allocation of funds for a time. The initial market opening had 0.6 or 0.7 fen, and the result topped out at one jiao, which also shows the slightly tight market atmosphere. In terms of interbank lending transactions, over 2.1 million was transferred in the morning market, and over 300,000 was newly transacted. In the afternoon market, over 400,000 was transacted. In the Small General Association, over 800,000 was transacted. In terms of foreign mortgage lending transactions, over 500,000 was redeemed, and over 1.2 million was newly done. In terms of banknote transactions, over 800,000 was recovered, and over 900,000 was issued, with another 600,000 in marked notes, and 200,000 was received in cash. In terms of bank receipts and payments, foreign banks received and paid over 3.4 million in notes, over 4.7 million in various goods and foreign exchange, over 600,000 in telegraphic transfers, over 800,000 in special foreign exchange, over 3.2 million in year-end settlements, over 1.2 million in foreign exchange settlements, and 800,000 in goods were warehoused. Chinese banks received and paid over 4.0 million in notes, over 800,000 in telegraphic transfers, and 800,000 in goods were warehoused. Chinese banks received and paid over 4.0 million in notes, over 800,000 in telegraphic transfers, and over 5.0 million in various foreign exchange goods and tax payments, over 2.2 million in foreign exchange settlements, over 2.4 million in year-end settlements, and 400,000 in goods were released from the warehouse. Japanese banks received and paid over 2.7 million in notes, over 4.4 million in various foreign exchange goods, over 1.5 million in year-end settlements, over 800,000 in special foreign exchange, over 1.2 million in foreign exchange settlements, and 600,000 in goods were released from the warehouse. Money shops received and paid over 32 million in foreign public bills, over 5.6 million in foreign exchange interest payments, over 800,000 in various regional foreign exchange, and had 400,000 in customer sources and 500,000 in outflows. In addition, the bill exchange was 1,982 yuan and 6 jiao and 7 fen, including 5,439,668 yuan and 7 jiao in silver dollars, and 6,623,313 yuan and 9 jiao and 7 fen in exchange transfers. In addition, the daily interbank lending rate of the Joint Reserve Committee's 21st public bills was one jiao per 1,000 yuan, and the current public bill rate was one jiao five fen per 1,000 yuan per day.</p>
<h3>The Jiangnan Coin's Decline is Particularly Severe</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Jiangnan small silver dollar was 852.5 yuan in the morning market, a drop of 7.5 yuan compared to the previous day. The afternoon market continued to fall by 3.5 yuan, to 849 yuan. As a result, it fell a total of 11 yuan. Although trading was not bad, the atmosphere of the market declined due to repatriation from various regions. The trading volume was 4,000 jiao in the morning market and 3,000 jiao in the afternoon market. The Guangdong small silver dollar was 755.5 yuan in the morning market, a small drop of 0.5 yuan compared to the previous day. The afternoon market continued to drop slightly by 0.5 yuan, to 755 yuan. As a result, it fell by one yuan. The trading volume was 225,000 jiao in the morning market and 90,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins were 306,000 wen, still the same as the previous day. The trading volume was 36,720 strings of wen, equivalent to 12,000 yuan in foreign currency.</p>
<h3>Securities, Tight Credit, and Bond Market Fluctuations are Sharp</h3>
<p>Three Consecutive Declines, Suddenly Surging at the Evening Close</p>
<p>Resulting in a Fall of Around Half a Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange observed a somewhat relaxed situation. However, the Tongyi Bank suddenly declared liquidation. Although interbank lending was only at one jiao, credit had tightened as a result. The decline of commerce and the signs of decline became increasingly apparent, and the market atmosphere was quite frantic. However, quietly observing the over-the-counter trading, retail investors mostly sold, and large investors mostly issued funds for long positions. Large investors mostly bought in to cover short positions. Sellers used the surrounding environment and seized the opportunity to pressure the market, while buyers also used this as a point and took the opportunity to cover their positions. There were more people selling at high prices and fewer people covering at low prices. The market price initially fell sharply, but later observed that the situation was likely to be peaceful, and those covering short positions rose again, causing a sharp rise. Based on this, it is inferred that if the situation does not expand, the market price is unlikely to fall significantly, because numbers four and sixteen on the floor appear to be buying more and more bravely. They can be considered the backbone of the market, and the people in the cabin are paying close attention to these two firms, so they have a considerable amount of potential to influence the market. Yesterday's passing was uneventful. The initial auction of the head plate was still firm. The price of retrenched soldiers rose by 0.1 yuan due to the need of number four. Afterwards, the selling pressure was too strong, and numbers five, forty-three, and sixty-four only issued and did not buy in. The market gradually declined, and the first round turned to a uniform decline of 0.1 to 0.45 yuan. The second round selling pressure slightly decreased, but the supply still exceeded demand, continuing to decline slightly by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. In the afternoon, there was a sudden opening bid to mark prices, and people became even more panicked. The selling pressure from various gangs was strong, and the price of staff reductions continued to fall by as much as 0.45 yuan. Other various types, only the twenty customs and gold shorts fell by more than 0.45 yuan, and the rest fell by only a small 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. The three consecutive declines were completely due to the tightening of credit. The panic of the people in the market can be seen here. The news in the evening market was better, and there was hope that the situation would calm down. People's hearts suddenly turned, and numbers four and sixteen continued to buy in. Floor short positions also rushed to buy in, and the market price gradually became firm. The consolidated tax rose sharply by 0.6 yuan, and the rest also rose by 0.3 to 0.5 yuan. The sharp fall and quick rise can predict that there will be no major events in the future. The market price ultimately fell by 0.2 or 0.3 yuan to 0.75 yuan, and the price of staff reductions also fell by as much as 0.7 yuan. The total number of transactions was estimated to be approximately 23 to 24 million yuan. The resulting gains and losses are listed in the comparative table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<h3>Yarn Tendering: Near-Term Weakness, Far-Term Stability</h3>
<p>The yarn market is near-term down and far-term up, and the market situation is still relatively stable. However, the current month's yarn Tongcheng Company is not only not continuing to take delivery of goods, but is instead delivering 1,500 bales of 20-count Fugui yarn that it had previously taken in. The short side also has 1,200 to 600 bales of new Fugui yarn to be delivered into the warehouse. As a result, the spirit of firmness has been temporarily hit. However, the long side of the far month is still firm, and it is said that the Guangdong side is more vigorous in the spot yarn sales market.</p>
<h3>Gold Rooster Fluctuations Still Minor</h3>
<p>At the opening of the yarn tendering session, the market was still calm and peaceful. Trading in the market became even more fragmented. However, when the third closing price was auctioned, the Ticheng Company, which was heavily promoted, continued to take delivery of yarn for the current month. As the end of the lunar year approached and credit became tighter, market rumors indicated that not only was it not taking delivery, but it was delivering 2,500 bales of 20-count Fugui yarn that it had previously taken in. At this point, the market situation suddenly turned lax, falling by 0.12 to 0.3 yuan. The far months rose by 0.2 yuan. In the afternoon opening, the current month was still weak, but the far-month long positions remained tight. At the close, over 1,100 bales of spot yarn were traded, and the market situation was still high, with near-term prices falling by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan and far-term prices rising by 0.5 to 0.6 yuan. It was found that Jinchang sold 450 bales, Jun Chang sold 450 bales, Tongxing sold 300 bales, Taichang sold 350 bales, Yuanda sold 500 bales, Changyu sold 600 bales, and Renfeng sold 850 bales.

<p>Shantou 40 Changsha 130 Wuhu 15 Peers 10</p>
<p>Guangdong 685 Inland 120 Ningbo 2</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Shows Slight Signs of Weakness</h3>
<p>The cotton market is flat, and the situation is slightly weak. However, overseas Indian and American cotton markets are still stable, so people's hearts are not panicked. It was found that Shanghai's spot cotton inventory is approximately 500,000 dan. There is also news that factories are stopping work early and starting work late, and there are also many who tend to go short. Approximately 4,000 dan of goods will be delivered this month. However, in the afternoon, Indian white cotton rose sharply by 7.75 rupees.</p>
<h3>Zheng Label is Stable</h3>
<p>At the opening of the cotton tendering session, the market was still flat. However, the closing situation of the previous day was quite weak, because it was generally expected that Indian cotton would fall sharply. However, the telegram only fell by one rupee, so people's hearts in the market were still stable. As a result, all months fell by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. In the afternoon, it was heard that the Indian cotton dark plate continued to fall by 0.25 yuan. At the same time, the yarn market was still good, and the selling pressure in the market was not very strong. The delivery of goods by the seller this month is estimated to be outside of 4,000 dan, and the situation is slightly weak, falling by 0.05 yuan. The far months rose and fell by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan.

<h3>Grain: Near-Term Flour Short Positions Covering</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning, presented an initial state of stability and continued gains. The price of foreign wheat, Chicago rose around 0.3 to 0.4 yuan, and Canada rose around 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. At the time of opening, due to the approaching settlement date for the current month, some outside short positions were slightly covered. Northern road customer gangs also slightly drew in, so the market atmosphere already seemed tight. The far-term months, because the factory's dumping was not strong, the market situation for each month was also slightly good. By the time of the afternoon opening, short positions were still being covered for the current month, and people's hearts continued to seem tight. February was close to this month, and people's hearts were also good. In the other months, buyers were not active, and small factories were slightly monthly hedged, so in the stable market atmosphere, there was also some fatigue. As a result, the current month rose by 0.25%, February rose by 0.2%, March rose by 0.125%, April rose by 0.15%, May rose by 0.175%, and June rose by 0.075%.</p>
<h3>February Wheat Futures Auction Price High</h3>
<p>This month's auctions were suspended early due to the Spring Festival</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the wheat market opened in the morning, the market for each month showed a trend of stabilizing first and then rising. In terms of imported wheat quotations, Chicago rose by 3.4 jiao, and Canada rose by about 2.3 jiao. At the opening, the February quotation opened, initially flat, but since the international wheat had risen for several days, market sentiment stabilized, and the flour market also rebounded. Therefore, the bid prices for each month gradually increased. Until the afternoon opening, the February market remained stable due to fewer sales and more purchases, and the bidding price was very stable. Due to the international wheat market, the increase in March was minimal. Observing the future, with only three days of trading, there are concerns about significant changes. As a result, February rose 6 fen, March rose 1 fen, and the rest remained unchanged. Because the existing wheat factories have not moved, there is no business done, it is said.</p>

<h3>Late Rice Market Not Much Glory or Humiliation</h3>
<p>(Hu Nan) Yesterday, the total arrivals from various sources were more than ten numbers (totaling more than 6,000 shi). Sales in this street were normal, but the volume of wholesale customer purchases was quite active. Qingdao merchants purchased 1,500 to 1,600 packages, so the late rice situation turned to be flat. The market did not show much glory or humiliation. Only the previous grades saw a slight decline of a few fen jiao due to lack of inquiries. The market for various types of thick japonica rice was softer due to weak local demand, with a continued drop. Du Yangjian and Yin Yuan were out of stock and without a market. Bian Yuan continued to show a soft trend because the outflow was not extensive.</p>
<p>(Hu Bei) Yesterday, the arrivals from various ports downstream of the river were scarce because the dealers were interrupted when passing through Jingzhi to Yejidun. Only thirteen or fourteen numbers arrived. In terms of market sales, the outflow of white japonica rice was still not smooth, Bian Yuan and thin rice slightly eased, Yangjian was sluggish. The market price of high-grade white japonica rice remained stable, the middle and lower grades continued to weaken by nearly a jiao, and Bian Yuan was slightly lower than a jiao, while thin rice and Yangjian were flat and weak.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Morning Firm, Afternoon Flat</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market saw very active local demand in the morning, and the market was firm. However, the mainland only purchased 700 colors of rice, and did not inquire about other varieties. After this street purchased 1,500 bags of Saigon rice, there were only 200 tons of futures transactions. The total amount of inbound and outbound goods in the city was small, and the market turned into a calm state. Foreign merchants' sales did not complete due to disagreements on prices, and the market situation remained smooth. The price of customer rice rose in the morning due to active local and mainland demand, and the market showed signs of rising, but in the afternoon, customer demand stopped, and foreign rice sales were also slow, so the market turned from rising to flat. A total of 278 bags of various types of rice were sold throughout the day, most of which were purchased by local merchants, it is said.</p>
<h3>Soybean Market Price Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean market continued to see a sharp rise. As a result, the price rose by jiao, mainly because the source of supply was not abundant, the outflow continued, and the prices in various producing areas increased. The oil cake market remained tight. It was also heard that the Dalian market was rising sharply, which made the cargo owners firm in their willingness to sell. Yesterday, soybeans from Longhai Road and other places were held tight and did not open. Only more than 10,000 bags of Dalian soybeans and Hankou soybeans were traded. It is estimated that 14-15 truckloads of Sipingjie soybeans were traded, with prices opening from 4.20 yuan to 4.25 yuan, purchased by factories. This street purchased more than 300 bags of Fanjiatun soybeans, priced at 4.40 yuan. The mainland and this street purchased more than 3,600 bags of Hankou Zha soybeans, with prices ranging from 3.78 yuan to 3.86 yuan. 1,300 bags of soybeans, with prices ranging from 3.70 yuan to 3.75 yuan. More than 300 bags of Hantao soybeans, priced at 4.10 yuan and 3.85 yuan. Also, 200 bags of Shashi soybeans, priced at 3.56 yuan.</p>
<h3>Rain in the North</h3>
<p>White Lotus Rises by Two or Three Yuan</p>
<p>Recently, the price of white lotus has been rising due to a shortage of inventory. The local price in Lanxi has gradually risen to 44 yuan. Therefore, the Shanghai market has been very active and has risen sharply. The market price has risen from 45 yuan to 46 yuan. Yesterday, the market called for 48 yuan. At the same time, Xianglian remained sluggish due to the still thick inventory, and the market remained stable.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Coarse Sand White Drops Again by a Few Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market continued to be weak. The guild's market price for ordinary spot 24 coarse sand white was 18.6 yuan, and 18.67 yuan for delivery at the pier, a drop of a few jiao. There were no transactions for Dutch red sugar. There were no changes in cotton white sugar from this factory and Taikoo sugar. The number plates had Chaoqing opened at 200+ bags, priced from 9.80 to 10.50 yuan, and several dozen bags of Hainan red sugar at 11 yuan, down half a yuan from the previous week. Jianbang Haojia opened more than 100 bags of Quanzhou Pianqing, from 9.80 to 10 yuan. The arrivals included two shipments of Chaoqing from Xinjiang Yisheng, totaling more than 5,000 bags, and 203 bags of Zhiyang.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Current Inventory of Foreign Sugar in This City</h3>
<p>Type Current Inventory Compared to Previous Inventory</p>
<p>Coarse Sand White 76,392 Decreased by 1,037</p>
<p>Dutch Red 47,920 Increased by 5,809</p>
<p>Cotton White 5,089 Increased by 5,809</p>
<p>Cuba 23,350 Decreased by 1,000</p>
<p>Yellow Sugar 50</p>
<p>Medium Sand White 100 Decreased by 100</p>
<p>Taikoo White 4,600 Decreased by 2,700</p>
<p>Total 147,512 bags</p>
<h3>Oil Market</h3>
<p>White Tung Oil's Rising Trend Slightly Subdued</p>
<p>Since the export of white tung oil turned strong, all markets have felt that the supply is not enough to meet demand. In particular, the Hankou market is lively. Because the January futures sold last year must be delivered, but the arrivals are still scarce. So the arriving goods are being snapped up by different parties. According to Xiangtong Huai, the price has risen to 26.34 yuan per dan, which can be said to be a case of scarcity makes it valuable. Foreign firms in this port are also purchasing successively, although the amount is not large, but because they rely on Zhejiang tung, and the adequate amount of spot goods in Zhejiang has been completely searched. It is said that Zhejiang Province's tung production has only become prosperous in the last ten years, and it is not comparable to the areas where tung production is most abundant in Sichuan, Hunan, and Hubei. If there is demand from foreign firms, the supply will naturally be insufficient. Therefore, the price in Hangzhou has recently reached 27.4 yuan per dan for adequate goods. However, this year, due to the drought, most of the goods are inadequate, so it is quite difficult to lend to foreign firms, and the price has reached its peak, and purchasers cannot help but be daunted. Recent correspondence from Hangzhou details that transactions are not as active as before, mainly because the high price has not convinced people, and the previous futures contracts are also about to be settled, so the situation seems to be more stable than before. In addition, the end of the accounting period is approaching, and various places are engaged in closing, so there will be little trading, but the inventory in various places is not abundant. Even if the outflow is slightly smooth, it will only be a big rise and a small pullback, and it will not be easy to achieve a big drop.</p>

<h3>Thoughts on Oxen</h3>
<p>— Ling Mo</p>
<p>If "Nature" had not built a special noble world for the noble-minded, the noble-minded would indeed have the dream of building one themselves. The creatures in that noble world are all extraordinarily uncommon; grass is fragrant orchids, trees are winter plums, insects are clear cicadas, and birds are white cranes. As for beasts, it seems that none of them are generally recognized as particularly noble; perhaps beasts are not of concern to the noble-minded at all, but at least one kind of beast has had some connection with the noble-minded: the deer. The imagined deer-riding immortals are, of course, ethereal and unattainable, but the high-minded scholars who kept deer in the records can truly captivate some people.</p>
<p>If the custom of keeping deer still existed now, then comparing it to the Western practice of keeping dogs, one could truly say that the difference between elegance and vulgarity is worlds apart. Unfortunately, it seems that nowadays no one keeps deer except for pharmacies, although pharmacies still call them immortal deer, but that is to use their blood as an advertisement for themselves; they probably do not slaughter them any differently than slaughtering a pig. It is, of course, regrettable that deer have fallen into such a practical animal, but if you think about their cousins, the oxen, then you won't be surprised.</p>
<p>The plum blossom fairy deer in paintings is certainly very different from an ox, but the deer that we usually see are very similar to oxen. There is a kind of oxcart in the Malay Peninsula, and the animals that pull the carts are said to actually be deer, but they are mistakenly called oxen. I have not researched this claim in detail, so I do not know if it is reliable. Those oxen are significantly different from Chinese oxen in that they run very fast. But the speed of running is not what distinguishes oxen from deer; the "slow-moving" oxen that we see are specifically known to the world as Chinese oxen. In the American West, there are still so-called "bull-riding heroes," and the dissemination of American Western films and newsreels has made us quite familiar with them. The oxen that they ride have not shed their wild nature and buck fiercely, so those who can ride them can be called heroes. Originally, all oxen were wild, and it is thought that Chinese oxen are not inherently slow, but have been trained to be this way through thousands of years of plowing the fields. Legend has it that the blue ox ridden by Lao Tzu could travel eight hundred li a day, which may be an exaggeration, but it is possible that oxen were truly used for long-distance travel in ancient times, allowing them to run fast. Haven't horses also been used for plowing the fields and become slow-moving?</p>
<p>The ability of humans to change the habits of animals is truly astonishing, but most people are unaware of the greatness of this ability. They believe that the domestication of animals is due to the physiological weakness of the animals. Why can an ox with thousands of pounds of strength be controlled obediently by an eight- or nine-year-old cowherd? According to villagers, it is because the ox's eyes see people as big as mountains, and they are naturally afraid. Northerners also offer the same explanation for the control of camels, which are even larger than oxen. On the other hand, snakes, which often cause harm to humans, are explained as having eyes that see people very small, so they dare to attack people. These explanations do not align with true animal psychology, but human psychology can be seen from these explanations.</p>
<p>Initially, they were not trying to make the ox's eyes smaller, but rather trying to make the ox itself smaller; people do indeed see things they are very familiar with as smaller. In a short story, Garshin described the psychology of children, saying that mothers are three feet tall and fathers are six feet tall, which is very well-founded. However, since most people are no longer children, nor are they primitive people, they have had to come up with a different explanation for oxen, which can obviously be measured. At the same time, they often retain primitive psychology toward rarely seen animals. If you ask someone who has never seen a lion what kind of animal it is, they will definitely think that a lion is much bigger than an ox.</p>
<p>The belief that a certain animal is noble also applies the same psychology. It is said that there was once a merchant who believed that cranes were viviparous, so he cherished them very much, but finally saw them lay two eggs, and could not help but be disappointed. Such people who shattered myths are still smart. On the other hand, there is another story: a certain Taoist believed that he was well-versed in cultivating immortality and could ascend to heaven, so he bought cranes to ride, crushing several of them to death, but he still believed that becoming an immortal was possible. Although this is ridiculous, that kind of psychology is not uncommon.</p>

<h3>A Record of Crossing the Ridge on a Snowy Night (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Xian He</p>
<p>Let's go there to rest for a while, let's go there to warm up for a while.</p>
<p>Who doesn't think this way, hope this way? But all around is darkness, steep cliffs, unable to touch, unable to see clearly. Trapped in such a desperate situation, rest and warmth are just fantasies. Here is just a blur, a chaos, an undeveloped, indistinguishable-north-from-south wilderness... No villages, no palaces, not even a dilapidated pavilion can be seen... Darkness, cold... Alas, if only we could see a broken thatched hut, a flickering candle in the wind...</p>
<p>But suddenly, the darkness broke open, and a few faint but very crisp "Ooh—Ooh—Ooh—" sounds came.</p>
<p>Is this a rooster crowing? Is it a human voice, human music?</p>
<p>Yes, yes, it is a rooster crowing, it is the sound of the human world, human music. We all affirmed this, so everyone cheered up. Although the snow was falling more rapidly, and the wind was blowing harder, we quickened our pace and emboldened ourselves, as if no longer cold, even feeling warm all over. We imagined that this must be a village, a place to stay. We fantasized about delicacies, hot tea, kind inquiries, courteous hospitality, comfortable rice straw beds, warm attics... At that time, perhaps the snow, the wind, the slippery and treacherous ridge, the winding mountain road, and the boundless fog that had tormented us for half the night would all become poetic material, artistic inspiration; even that vague terror would become a vivid anecdote to charm the hostess.</p>
<p>—Where do you think the village is?</p>
<p>—Probably just behind this mountain pass.</p>
<p>—Then it must be almost here.</p>
<p>We walked, climbed, and slipped desperately, our minds filled with fantasies—all kinds of sweet, romantic fantasies. Unknowingly, we turned past the mountain pass, crossed the steep ridge, and the "Ooh—Ooh—Ooh" sounds, almost musical, were sometimes near, sometimes far, seemingly real, yet seemingly faintly echoing in our ears.</p>
<p>But turning past one mountain pass was just another mountain pass, crossing one ridge was just another ridge, but we still couldn't see a single fence or a single thatched hut. All around was empty and cold, looking ahead was fog, looking back was also fog, where was the village?</p>
<p>We were stiff, numb, our feet sometimes unable to stand steadily, as if floating in mid-air; sometimes they were heavy as if dragging a thousand pounds of weight, unable to move. Our fantasies disappeared, and we felt the coldness of the snowy night and the difficulty of the journey again... Often, when it is snowing, half of the sky will suddenly reveal a streak of azure blue, or even show mottled clouds, and people who have been trapped in the wind and snow for a long time will always think that the weather is about to clear up, and they will feel inexplicably elated; but immediately the sky turns gray again, and all the blue and clouds disappear in the blink of an eye, and the snow falls down like pouring from an overturned bucket, this phenomenon is what is called "opening the snow eyes"... The disillusionment of our hopes was as rapid and as empty as "opening the snow eyes"...</p>
<p>We don't know when we will be able to cross this endless, steep ridge of life, but we still have to move forward.</p>
<h3>Small Contrast</h3>
<p>— Ding Yishan</p>
<p>Last night, I went to see a friend and saw that he had recently bought an English translation of Faust, with excellent binding and illustrations. The translator was Clarke, I believe, but unfortunately, I cannot remember the full name. I flipped through the book's preface and learned that there are more than twenty English translations of Faust, Part One, and many translations of Part Two as well. The translator also mentioned in the preface that some of the existing translations had already been recognized as standard translations by critics. Nevertheless, this translator still had the courage and ability to translate it again after there were already over twenty translations, which is truly admirable. According to the translator's preface, he had made up his mind to translate this "twenty-somethingth" translation more than twenty years ago. This lets us know that translation is not an easy task. Furthermore, there are many similarities between English and German. Even with over twenty translations, it is still impossible to fully satisfy everyone, which shows that the attention to detail in translation is limitless.</p>
<p>Today, I was reading a Nanjing newspaper and saw a strange story. It was a coincidence, really. There was a notice published by two translators, A and B, saying that they had translated a book from Japanese and also "respectfully announced" to "the translation community across the country" that they hoped that no one else would translate the book. Similar things have happened before. I remember that it was some large bookstore that advertised that many books were currently being translated by people and would be published soon. The purpose was nothing more than to seek a monopoly; it was purely commercial. However, it has never been the case that translators publish a notice to "respectfully announce" to the translation community that they should no longer translate a certain book. I have asked many people about the level of these two translators, and nobody knows how good or bad they are. All I know is that one of them only lived in Japan for a few months. Regarding this "respectful announcement" from the two translators, I remain skeptical.</p>
<p>If they are afraid that others will labor in vain, it always seems unreasonable to say so. If others are happy to translate, no one can interfere. This "respectful announcement" from the two translators is just a waste of effort; it is just empty talk. In that case, perhaps the two translators are somewhat confident that their translation is a standard translation. They think others might labor in vain, so that is the reason. This is truly a bit shameless. Inventions can be patented, and writings have copyrights. But publishing a translation and then "respectfully announcing" that others should no longer translate is truly something that cannot be explained. Perhaps someone will invent "first translation rights" in the future. However, what is the relationship between first translation rights, the quality of the translation, and the act of translating again? What does it have to do with a "respectful announcement?" Maybe everyone is so used to talking about economic controls and cultural controls that they are now going to implement translation control as well? It seems that just stating the event is enough.</p>
<p>The differences between Chinese and other languages are very large. In my humble opinion, the similarities between Japanese and Chinese are not as many as those between English, German, and French. Given the greater similarities between English, German, and French, there are still books translated more than twenty times. For Chinese and Japanese, where the similarities are fewer, for a single translation to "respectfully announce" that others should no longer translate is truly child's play.</p>
<p>In order to achieve perfect translations, it is necessary for several translations to exist at the same time. No one can claim to be perfect. In England, for vast books like War and Peace and Anna Karenina by Tolstoy, there are two very popular translations by Garnett and Maude. If their literary community saw the notice from these two translators, they would inevitably feel that the abilities of the Chinese are too great.</p>
<p>Fortunately, translators like these two are not common in the translation community. Many famous works already have different translations. We further hope that the translation community will translate more, translate in competition, and that those who can translate better are welcome to translate again.</p>
<h3>The Human World (6)</h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>The east and west rooms were the same size, part of a three-room flat-roofed house connected by a ridge. There were no smoking sets in this east room. It was a bedroom, and the bedding and furnishings were somewhat better.</p>
<p>As soon as I entered, I lay down on the kang. I wanted to rest and calm my mind. But it was impossible. My mind insisted on dwelling on the scene of my friend smoking in the west room. I wondered, what kind of atmosphere was he introducing me to by bringing me here? Did he want me to appreciate Harbin's private prostitutes, or to get acquainted with Harbin's private opium dens? And why did he treat this place with such mystery, keeping it a secret from me beforehand?</p>
<p>Little Ju also lay down on the kang, staring at me blankly and curiously. She wore three gold rings on her left hand, which glinted faintly. I thought to myself:</p>
<p>"Poor girl, each ring probably represents how many times you've lost your virginity."</p>
<p>However, I found this small opium den somewhat strange. Since I couldn't calm my mind, I might as well chat with her. Perhaps I could unknowingly cure my groggy head. I asked:</p>
<p>"Why don't you open an opium den on the street?"</p>
<p>I asked this question sincerely, but she pursed her lips and smiled, as if not trusting that I was being genuine. After a moment, however, she still replied with a smile:</p>
<p>"Rent is high on the streets, Director Li."</p>
<p>"Isn't there more business too?"</p>
<p>This Little Ju, though young, was shrewd. She was laughing at me, but it was a different kind of laugh. It was a mocking laugh, mocking me for being a director and not understanding the situation, asking her about it so persistently. Or perhaps she thought I was deliberately troubling her. But when she answered me, her attitude was very serious. She said:</p>
<p>"To be honest—I think you understand this better than we do; the cheap rent is what makes this place affordable. We don't pay protection money, we have girls, and we don't have fewer customers than the opium dens on the street. Not fewer, not at all fewer. Our business is even better than those on the main streets. Don't you know that the police department is cracking down on female attendants in opium dens? Smokers aren't very willing to go just for a few puffs of opium if there are no female attendants to prepare the opium and chat. Understand? That's the reason."</p>
<p>Although I wasn't a real director in the police department, I had seen a semi-serious, semi-humorous news item in the newspaper a few days ago. The newspaper said that all the prostitutes in Harbin, due to poor business, had jointly sued the female attendants in restaurants and opium dens, accusing them of stealing their business and demanding that the authorities crack down on them. Sure enough, after a few days, all the female attendants in restaurants and opium dens were cracked down on and banned. However, the restaurants and opium dens suffered significant business losses as a result and jointly petitioned the authorities to restore the original situation. The authorities issued a ruling saying that since restaurants and opium dens relied on food and opium to attract customers, they couldn't compare to prostitutes, whose business relied entirely on people, so they rejected the request.</p>
<p>This was a fact, and this fact quickly flashed through my mind. I understood that this created opportunities for private opium dens.</p>
<h3>Struggle</h3>
<p>— Sanlang</p>
<p>Those early years, when I was living a beautiful and lovely life in a comfortable home, who would have thought that the vagrant life now would be more bitter and thorny than bitter wine?</p>
<p>The whip of life is so cruel! Tightly, it whips me from the quiet home, the pitch-black environment, to this vast, night-like sea. It must be the driving force of great hope and the god of light.</p>
<p>Although this terrible, wicked journey has left me with deep wounds, although the whip of life has ravaged me, leaving me with such a pale face and deeply dimmed eyes, I have no regrets that it was my own fault. This is the misfortune that society has given us! However, I hate those writers who carry the air of millionaires, hypocritically exploiting us poor writers to the utmost.</p>
<p>This era is full of evil snakes!</p>
<p>However, those who love me and also give me sorrow are so devout:</p>
<p>"Go back, why go to die on the road to starvation instead of living a comfortable life?"</p>
<p>Ugh! Get out, I don't want to hear such words. If I wanted to go back, I shouldn't have run away in the first place. Can disappointment and stimulation wear down my heart?</p>
<p>I wait for the light, I need great passion. Although the whip of life still cruelly descends upon me, I resist, I struggle, until I can no longer live. The future is full of the skulls of the dead. Then, I will go mad, I will roar, I will do what I must to the utmost of my ability.</p>

<p>Shen Bao Local Supplement</p>
<p>Discussions</p>
<h3>A Panorama of Shanghai Commerce (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Wuluo</p>
<p>"Shanghai Bund, Shanghai Bund, Shanghai will eventually collapse." I had heard this saying since I was young. Since the "January 28th Incident," the Shanghai market has fallen sharply, to the point of seeming irrecoverable. Even considering the accounts of the year before last, in Shanghai, known as the "New York of the East," on the Great Horse Road, known as the commercial center of Shanghai, only two and a half stores could actually make money. The rest barely covered expenses without profit, or even suffered significant losses and struggled to stay afloat. As for last year, the phenomenon of economic downturn was such that in this city alone, both the Chinese and foreign concessions had no fewer than a hundred stores that had already closed. There were probably even more that wanted to close but hadn't yet. Many newly built, magnificent storehouses and residences remained unoccupied for years. This situation was an unprecedented tragedy since the opening of the concessions. If no fundamental remedies are found, the situation will worsen day by day, year after year, and the impression of utter failure will be bottomless.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation has proposed postponing the current major industrial and commercial year-end closing for one year and extending the rent payment for six months. At first glance, this policy may seem like an emergency plan, but upon closer examination, there are many obstacles. I don't understand business, and I don't understand the principles of economics, but I feel that there are several points in this proposal that should be studied.</p>
<p>(1) Last year, due to the economic downturn, the year-end closing was postponed for one year. Suppose the commercial situation this year suddenly improves, then last year's accounts may be settled this year. But what if the market remains depressed or even worsens?</p>
<p>(2) During this one-year postponement, will money and goods still be exchanged? If things remain the same, how can new debts be added when the old debts are not cleared? If there is no exchange, who knows if this will be used as an excuse to ignore the old debts altogether. And since there is no exchange, liquidity will inevitably suffer, further accelerating the collapse.</p>
<p>(3) It can already be predicted that the current market situation will worsen year after year. The reason why last year's accounts could not be closed was because of losses and no profits, so the year-end closing was postponed for one year. But if this year's situation is the same, then closing the loss-making accounts for one year is already difficult, and trying to close the loss-making accounts for two years will probably be even more difficult.</p>
<p>(4) If the industrial and commercial year-end closing is postponed, then users will also postpone their own year-end closing. This will make it even more difficult to collect debts, and the losses of merchants will increase accordingly. Moreover, the reasons why industrial and commercial enterprises must close their accounts every year are, first, that without closing, it will be impossible to calculate profits and losses, and second, that if transactions continue without closing for a long time, the accounts will be impossible to clear.</p>
<h3>Oath</h3>
<p>— Maohua</p>
<p>In the eastern sky hangs a bright hope. I walk towards that hope day and night. Hope itself will not deceive people, I know. And it has never deceived anyone. Those who say hope is deceiving are just some incompetent, cowardly, defeated old folks who dropped out halfway. They are unwilling to use continuous effort to approach hope, to shake hope's hand, to seize hope as the realization of their aspirations. Instead, they always stand in the barren wilderness, pointing to hope and cursing it.—Saying that hope deceived them, but never admitting their own incompetence. Without weaving, of course, there will be no clothes to wear. Without sowing, of course, there will be no rice to eat. Without arduous effort, of course, the desired goal will not be achieved. There may be exceptions, but those are parasites who reap without sowing. We are about to find ways to eradicate them!</p>
<p>With this firm faith and aspiration, I embarked on my journey, and it has been almost six or seven years now. Although the land of hope has not yet been reached, I am getting closer and closer. That is always the truth. See, that light of hope has become brighter. It is shining brightly in the eastern sky.</p>
<p>It is night, and I must sit on this stone stool to rest for a while.</p>
<p>Glancing at the misty road I have come from, I cannot help but feel a little pain. On that long journey I have already traveled, I have encountered storms and lightning. At that time, I was all alone. The storm shook my tired body, the rain beat my old face, the lightning shocked my leaping heart, the lightning illuminated my gaunt face, but I never gave in to coercion and retreated, nor did I flee in fear. I finally overcame the difficulties and moved forward!</p>
<p>Although my body is tired, my heart is</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>never tired.</p>
<p>Storms, lightning, those many evil clouds in the clear sky, the obstacles of the journey, have not caused me any significant losses. Although my clothes are soaked and my steps are faltering, that is common for a long-distance wanderer. Clothes that are wet will be dried by the sun tomorrow, and faltering steps will disappear after the storm passes. However, what often pricks my toes are the thorns, thorns, thorns everywhere!</p>
<p>"Thorns are covered with leaves of sympathy," that is just the poet's beautiful illusion, a dreamlike singing. In fact, thorns are most unfavorable for a long-distance wanderer. But for the sake of those who come later, I bravely endure the pain and remove the thorns one by one. However, the countless fierce tigers and poisonous snakes that are startled from the thorn bushes make me waste all my strength in vain, to撲滅 them, to slaughter them, lest they harm future generations.</p>
<p>My body is even more tired, but my heart is even stronger.</p>
<p>I must walk towards that bright hope. Hope itself will not deceive people, I know. Don't you believe it? Look, hasn't the light of hope become brighter? It is shining brightly in the eastern sky.</p>
<p>Can't keep up, get out of here! Don't always stand in the middle of the road, gesticulating and cursing loudly. One's own downfall is a small matter, don't hinder the progress of others!</p>
<p>Only forward is our path to survival; and only forward is our aspiration.—I recite this oath at all times.</p>
<p>What makes me infinitely happy is that I used to be all alone, but now there are more and more companions moving forward.</p>
<p>We all believe that hope itself will not deceive people.</p>
<h3>The Treatment of Prisoners</h3>
<p>— Sanduo</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 20th), the Guangzhou correspondence in the Evening News reported that a large number of prisoners in the Guangdong Detention Center refused to eat due to poor treatment; on the same day, the local newspapers reported that the five members of the Dagou Gang also petitioned for the prisoners before their execution.</p>
<p>Committing a crime and being sued is a matter of course, but there are also those who escape justice, which is an exception because fingers are of different lengths when you reach out your hand. In law, once criminals have been judged by the law, the law does not provide for deprivation of food in prison because of the crime. As the saying goes, "There is only capital punishment, not starvation." This seems unreasonable in human terms. Prisoners are served breakfast at 9:00 AM and dinner at 4:00 PM (I guess this is not something excessive at other prisons), compared to the free man's breakfast, afternoon tea, midnight snack and other food volume, has been reduced to less than could be. This is because they are criminals, so of course that is not an issue. But in this sum of eight cents for two meals, the person in charge of the detention center actually initiates "prisoner wealth" and only issues one cent. I wonder if they can safely swallow the big fish and meat deducted from the coarse rice and salted vegetable soup without feeling some bloody stench? Furthermore, in order to commit a crime, one goes to prison, and the prison is the place to enforce the law. Like the story of the farmer and the lawyer arguing about the dead cow, I really want to ask whether the person in charge of the detention center's deduction of prisoner food can be regarded as a criminal act; to go a step further, even if the law allows the person in charge to taste the eight-cent prisoner meal, those prisoners who have already "become skin and bones and whose eyes have sunk in" probably would not agree with this method of venting anger. The future is long, what is to be done?</p>
<p>As for the head of the prison actually detaining the criminal in a dark room for as long as two months, while living in a loft and cursing not seeing the sun every day, the degree of darkness of this dark room must be as terrifying as the gates of hell. That man called Chen Hanhua is probably going to be released fifteen years early—the image of that coffin swaying unsteadily in the car among the desperados has not disappeared from my mind to this day!</p>
<p>I heard people discussing the "sexual desire problem" of prisoners before, but I think we should first think about their stomachs and skin. Sexual intercourse for prisoners lying in the northwest wind is not a very necessary thing after all!</p>
<h3>The Composition of Massacre</h3>
<p>— Yuyan</p>
<h3>The First Day Back in My Hometown</h3>
<p>— Rui</p>
<p>It's been a year since the second hometown, and I haven't been there for six or seven years in a row. Although I always want to go back and take a look, my mother never allows it. Her reason is:</p>
<p>"The countryside now is not like it used to be. In the past, we could run around every day to visit some famous scenic spots, or to see the tombs of our ancestors. What is there now? There are communists everywhere. The roads in the countryside are not easy to travel. You can only stay at home every day. What's so fun about that? I'm so old this year, and I don't want to go back and take a look. You young people, aren't you afraid of not having a chance to go back? Only when the world is peaceful will it be interesting!"</p>
<p>Whenever I mention going back to my hometown, my mother would say this whole set of words, and at the same time, she would talk endlessly about how good the peaceful world in the countryside was when she was young decades ago, how many places there were to play, and she would keep talking until I walked away because I didn't want to listen anymore. Because of this, I didn't want to mention it to her again.</p>
<p>In the summer of the year I turned nineteen, it was said that the world in the countryside was a little more peaceful, so I mentioned the idea of going back to my hometown to my mother again. At first, she didn't allow it, but after my cousin and I asked, she had no choice but to agree.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, on a very hot day, as soon as the sky in the east began to dawn, my cousin and I left the pier in City S and took a small steamer back to our hometown.</p>
<p>It's been many years since I've returned to my hometown. When I saw my hometown far away in the distance, I felt so happy! That area of dense bamboo groves, green and lush, surrounds the outskirts of my hometown. In the bamboo groves, the very tall Han Wengong Pavilion stands high. The red gourd on the pavilion has already collapsed</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>I still recognize it. To the south of that gourd pavilion is my home.</p>
<p>The closer I got, the happier I became. Although I knew that the situation in the countryside had been very bad in recent years, I always thought: It's been a few years since I've been back, it must have become better than before.</p>
<p>Full of excitement, I walked through the bamboo forest and entered the village gate. Suddenly, I felt scared and cold in my heart. I thought: My hometown has turned into this. Wasn't this main road into the village very lively in the past? Now it has become so desolate, there is not a single person in sight, not even a chicken or a dog. The houses on both sides are crooked and dilapidated, and there are no families living in them. Those vermilion doors are all gone, leaving only the half-collapsed stone pillars piled with rubble. Why is this happening? Did everyone die?</p>
<p>A strange and bleak feeling occupied my heart. The excitement I had felt when running far away on the road had been shattered by the sight before me.</p>
<p>The door of my house was reached, and I walked in with heavy steps.</p>
<p>"Oh! Zhi Uncle is back. It's been a few years since you've been here! Where's your mother?"</p>
<p>A middle-aged woman with disheveled hair and wearing blue cloth clothes was washing clothes by the well. She heard my footsteps and suddenly raised her head to look at my face for a moment. Her face, which had already lost its youth and was pale, revealed a trace of a smile before she walked up to me and asked. When she approached me, I realized that this was Sister-in-law Ruixian.</p>
<p>Third Aunt, Second Aunt, Third Sister-in-law, and Eldest Sister-in-law all ran out of the upper and lower halls when they heard that I was back. As I talked to them and greeted them, I paid attention to the face and body of each of them, which made me feel infinitely sad. I thought: They have all aged and become gaunt, especially Sister-in-law Ruixian.</p>
<p>A few years ago, when I returned to my hometown, she had just married Brother Ruixian. At that time, she was so young and so beautiful. Everyone in the village said she was the most beautiful. Brother Ruixian was also young and strong at that time, and his business was going smoothly, so everyone said they were a good couple. But now, everything has changed. Brother Ruixian has also wandered off to Nanyang. His very wealthy family fortune has gone bankrupt, and Sister-in-law Ruixian has had to work as a half-servant and do housework at home. That youthful beauty, that sweet life, she has lost. Wrinkles have appeared on her face, and her eyes are yellowish-gray.</p>
<p>The first day back in my hometown, everything disappointed me, and a layer of gray melancholy covered my heart. I thought:</p>
<p>"The bankruptcy of the countryside is so severe!"</p>
<h3>Shantou Orphanage</h3>
<p>— Yujiong</p>
<p>In the late autumn southern country, a warm breeze carrying slight heat floats, and the gentle people feel as if it were early spring, in waves of drowsiness. Due to Bing's suggestion, we went together to visit the orphanage. The orphanage in Shantou City is considered a relatively famous spectacle. Anyone who has been to Shantou will not miss it for sightseeing. Therefore, my intention to visit the orphanage is, of course, no exception. Autumn colors reflect on the streets of the southern country, and the autumn wind rolls up dust and dances. We walked along the stone roads on both sides, and light white clouds floated in the sky, making us forget the heavy steps, and wandered like immortals on the streets swept by willow branches until we reached the gate of the orphanage. After Bing signed our names for us, Bing directly led us upstairs first, because Bing had been there once before, and he knew some of the situation inside better than us. Upstairs were the dormitories for male and female orphans, separated. Different slogans were written on all sides, with a tone of encouraging the children how to be human. Then we went downstairs again and saw the children playing flags and jumping in circles. Some girls were also weaving handicrafts and making flowers out of red and green paper... This is their playground, the person who guided us said. Then we turned around again and saw another group of children taking classes. It is said that they have a few hours of homework every day, as well as a few hours of games, and the rest of the time they work in the factory for a few hours. The children are all innocent, lively, and like the chosen children of heaven, the only difference is that because of this bad social system, they lost the nurturing of their loving mothers at a very young age and were placed in this orphanage to be raised.</p>
<p>The facilities of the Shantou Orphanage are relatively grand and spectacular. In addition to the orphanage's setting, the row behind is the asylum for mental patients, and further back is the orphanage's hospital, cafeteria, and factory, all of which are jobs that the children take on after they become adults; the achievement exhibition room is all the products of that factory. We walked around a large circle and carefully visited everything. Afterwards, we bought a strangely delicate bamboo basket made by the children themselves and placed in the exhibition room, and carried the bamboo basket out the door. The setting sun shone high on another corner of the sky, and the heat seemed to be lower, not as glaring as before. We all had satisfied hearts, congratulating this group of children who had lost their homes.</p>
<h3>Ancient Temple's Buddhist Sounds</h3>
<p>— Ye Fei</p>
<p>Doo…doo…doo doo…dong…… In a village not far from Qiaotou Town, the sounds of red wooden fish and green chimes always reverberate faintly, surrounding the village, every day without interruption.</p>
<p>These sounds emanate from the Water Lily Nunnery in Yujia Ferry. The nunnery is at the very front of the village. If someone runs into the village, the first thing that meets their eyes is the Water Lily Nunnery. Although it is a nunnery, its influence in this village is not small, and it is rumored that the nunnery suppresses the feng shui of this village, so people also respect and fear it.</p>
<p>The abbess of the nunnery is a robust old nun, about forty years old. Besides her, there are two young nuns in their teens, and one in her twenties. Their only income, aside from donations from people who come to burn incense, alms collected by the young nuns from villagers, and the sale of scriptures and repentance rituals, comes from cultivating some fields themselves. Furthermore, the old nun invests some extra money in usurious lending to the villagers.</p>
<p>The old nun is a snake in Buddha's clothing. Most hateful is her snobbery; she looks down on poor people, but fawns shamelessly on the wealthy and powerful. She is also flirtatious; her lover, the monk A Gen, stays in the nunnery every other day. If he doesn't come for three days, she sends the young nuns to call him, and sometimes even goes to his door to invite him herself. She treats others like slaves; the young nuns are beaten if they don't please her, and even the middle-aged one is often scolded. "If you don't want to stay here, you can leave. No one asked you to come in the first place. You're young, it would be much better to marry a husband. Why become a nun and suffer? If you stay here, this is how it will be…"</p>
<p>She had already been impatient with the old nun's lewd behavior, and now she was being ridiculed and mocked in this way, which made her truly heartbroken. She really couldn't bear it in her heart and wanted to talk back, intending to leave, but then she reconsidered, feeling that she couldn't, she couldn't. A wave of sorrow washed over her, and two streams of hot tears trickled down.</p>
<p>She walked into the Buddha hall, added oil to the glass lamp in front of the Guanyin (Avalokitesvara) statue, and saw that the incense in the incense burner on the Buddha table had burned out. She quickly lit more incense, sat down at a scripture table next to it, and opened the "Heart Sutra". Doo…doo…doo…dong… "Namo Maha Prajna Paramita," she struck the wooden fish erratically, striking, striking, striking, while her heart began to search through her own history of sorrow. She was only twenty-three years old this year. At twenty-three, youth shouldn't be allowed to pass by without value, but what about the old nun's wickedness? Alas! I truly regret becoming a nun! No, I can only blame my own fate for being so unlucky. My husband left me, his poor widow, after only one year of marriage! Since my husband died, I had made up my mind to sincerely remain a widow for him, but that evil family was so unforgiving, and even my husband's only posthumous child died before the age of one! So they tried to force me to marry my cousin. I hated the sight of that cousin, let alone marry him! When I refused, they ruthlessly drove me out. I collapsed on my husband's grave and cried, and later decided to shave my head and become a nun, so that I could repent before the Buddha for my past life, cultivate for the next, and also help deliver my dead husband. But that old nun is too unsympathetic to people's sorrows. She always mocks me, making me feel embarrassed. Alas! In short, my life is too bitter, so it's the same no matter where I go!</p>

<p>Opening "Silkworm Woman's Hatred"</p>
<p>Spring silkworms are raised, then autumn silkworms are busy. Many young village women pick mulberry leaves. Farmers only seek to make a living. Farm women work diligently day and night, forgetting sleep and food. The lights burn all night without rest. They eat yellow rice, green salt, and tofu soup. The picked wet leaves must be wiped clean. In the cold spring, they also use fire basins. If there is thunder in the early spring, the silkworm women are frightened and cry to the heavens. Therefore, raising silkworms and producing cocoons is not easy. It takes labor and effort and is a bitter experience. In recent years, Chinese silk merchants have been weakened. This is mostly due to the enemy's conspiracies and secret attacks. It is hateful that unscrupulous silk merchants use artificial goods. As a result, domestic silk is harmed. I hope the government will invent scientific instruments. To save the silk industry, improvements are needed. Know that it is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep are lost. Invigorate the spirit and the silk industry will prosper. I also advise the national sericulture guidance offices. Encourage farms to do their best to help. Manufacturers should strive to select carefully. Competing for silk cocoons can revitalize the country. Only then can the great Chinese industry be forever boundless.</p>

Recently, because of the drought, the fields have no water, and the villagers want to demolish the bridge to draw water for farming. However, Zhou, relying on his authority, prevented the villagers from demolishing the bridge. So, in the past few days, the problem of this bridge has made the villagers uneasy.</p>

<h3>Standards for the Central Film Studio's Actor Recruitment</h3>
<p>— Huang Tianzuo</p>
<p>This time, in order to promote the film culture and expand the film publicity path, the Central Government has decided to expand the Central Film Studio in the near future. In addition to the existing silent film studio outside Jiangdongmen, it will select another location with a better environment to build the most perfect sound film studio. With the help of experts, the material equipment of the studio will naturally meet the various conditions of modern European and American film studios. In addition to this, the most important thing we are paying attention to now is the issue of talent acquisition.</p>
<p>Actors are the most important tool for the expression of film art. Only with excellent actors—that is, tools—can there be powerful expression and media. As for how actors—that is, tools—can reach the realm of excellence, it depends on the artistic cultivation and environmental tempering that they have undergone.</p>
<p>The art and life of an artist are closely linked, and no one can deny this. If we want to organize or discipline the Chinese film industry—I think this is the most important condition for building a film enterprise—then not only should every film artist be familiar with basic artistic common sense, but also their personal behavior and life should be at least summarized into a disciplined and standardized track; especially the actors who serve as the clothing of films, they are arranged and promoted in such a way as to allow the masses to love, worship, and act as sacred idols. If their lives deviate from the track, they will cruelly shatter the ideals of the masses, shake the masses' love and worship of justice and beauty, and the discipline of human society will innocently lose the trust of the masses in an invisible way.</p>
<p>Now, the Central Film Studio is conducting large-scale actor recruitment in Shanghai, Beijing, and Pingdi. In addition to the (1) facial contours; (2) movements and gestures; and (3) acting ability of each person, as published in the advertisements, we want to especially emphasize that we also attach equal importance to the actor's behavior and life. In the past, the film industry did have a dark period, so all self-respecting men and women left it. In recent years, the Chinese film industry has been looking up, and these incorrect concepts should have been eliminated long ago. Moreover, the Central Film Studio is a state-run production institution and cannot be compared with other commercial ones. Serving in this studio is serving the country. I hope that all people who are interested in film or have artistic cultivation—especially male and female students—who used to be hesitant about film companies should gather in our camp.</p>
<p>We must also know that making films is definitely not speculation for profit, and being a film actor is definitely not speculation for fame. Everything must be based on scientific organization and artistic construction methods to consolidate the flimsy foundation of this emerging art. Accidental opportunism and excessive material support are both irrational organizational atoms, and collapse is only a matter of time. The "star system" of the gold yuan country is not worth learning from, or the only thing worth our reference is the Soviet Union's "artist system."</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Central Film Studio's actor recruitment, we want to state that in the future, the Central's camp of acting talents will absolutely not allow the existence of opportunism. All talents will be given equal opportunities for development under the guidance of the Party. As for remuneration, the standard will be to ensure a comfortable life. Irrational excessive affluence is enough to create a life of licentiousness and luxury, which is not what our Party hopes for. In the future, if there are people who make special contributions in acting or art, we may even give them the title of "Honored Artist of the Republic" and other honorary titles, which is not certain.</p>
<p>As for the Central Film Studio's future works, we want to adopt a new style and take a new path. Therefore, the recruitment of new talents is extremely urgent. Please readers do not underestimate yourselves, perhaps you are a future talent. It should also be added that the deadline for this actor recruitment is February 10. The registration office in Shanghai is at 37 Tong'an Lane, Hankou Road, International News Photography Agency.</p>
<h3>The Most Beautiful Woman in the World in the Eyes of an Artist</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>The most famous artist in New York, USA, Fred Morgan, recently made the following statement:</p>
<p>"The most beautiful woman in the world?" People often ask me. I dare to say a few words now, at the risk of great offense. But I want to ask those who were not mentioned by me to forgive me.</p>
<p>The ideal modern woman must have male appeal (Note, this is another name for sexuality SA.) On this point, I chose Jean Harlow. Although she has many other beautiful qualities, it is her incredible magical power to attract men that is most noticed.</p>
<p>In addition to beauty, my ideal beauty must also have mystery and splendor, like Marlene Dietrich. Although some people disagree with me, I firmly believe that a woman's beauty must have the temptation of a goddess to be called true beauty. On this point, Hollywood has no one more seductive and mysterious than Marlene Dietrich.</p>
<p>When I saw Joan Blondell, I found the physique of an all-American woman that artists dream of. She has cat-like yellow stripes, but she is also strong and healthy. It can be said that modern women have evolved their physiques beyond the beauty and health that their predecessors dreamed of because of their love of sports.</p>
<p>A truly beautiful woman must also be full of feminine tenderness. On this point, I think of Janet Gaynor. Her petite figure and gentle and pleasant demeanor can really make thousands of young men and women regard her as the benchmark of romance.</p>
<p>Finally, but also not least important, Joan Crawford is also part of the standard beauty in my eyes. What I saw was her intelligence and courage, which are characteristics that modern beauties must have.</p>
<p>Taken together, Jean Harlow's attractiveness, Marlene Dietrich's beauty, Joan Blondell's physique, Janet Gaynor's tenderness, and Joan Crawford's intelligence, when combined, become a modern beauty in the eyes of an artist. Beauty, oh beauty, it is really not easy to find!</p>

<h3>Yuan Muzhi is so Poor that he Resorts to the Pawnshop</h3>
<p>Due to the social depression, this year's stores and banks have suffered massive bankruptcies. However, only pawnshops have seen unexpected prosperity due to the increase in the number of poor people. For the needs of the poor, Diantong has specially opened a pawnshop on Xietu Road. The facade of the shop was designed by Zhang Yunqi and is exceptionally beautiful. Recently, craftsmen have been busy painting and decorating. The owner has also chosen an auspicious day, the 20th of this month, for the official opening. The poor poet Bai Hua (played by Yuan Muzhi) will go to the pawnshop to pawn his clothes that day because he has no money to use. It is said that the reason why Bai Hua does not go to other old pawnshops but goes to the newly opened pawnshop is because he is greedy for the new pawnshop's ability to pawn a few more coins.</p>
<h3>New Prospects for Yueming Company</h3>
<p>Yueming Company was very quiet in 1934 because they were systematically preparing to make sound films. The first film, "Madness," has been completed after several months of efforts by director Ren Pengnian and will be released soon. Now that 1935 has begun, they will start filming a large number of sound films. The decided films include "Exile" written by Li Faxi, "Female Warrior" written by Ding Ding, "Boat Girl" written by Cao Xuesong, "Hard Struggle" written by Wang Pingling, and "A Bright Future" written by Zuo Ming, five in total. Therefore, in 1935, Yueming will have a rapid development.</p>
<p>Most movie stars love to dance, but Yu Lizhu of Yueming Company is different. She likes to ride horses and is good at driving cars. Her driving skills are very high, and her history of driving cars is already very long. According to Yueming director Ren Pengnian, she has had a license from the Public Works Bureau for five years. She is truly China's only martial star.</p>
<p>Yueming's first sound film, "Madness," is directed by Ren Pengnian and has now been completed and will be released soon. In "Madness," there is a song called "Madness Song," with lyrics written by Li Faxi and music composed by Zhong Zhuru, and sung by the protagonist Yu Lizhu. The lyrics are generous, and the melody is passionate. It has now been printed and distributed to all sectors. Anyone who wants to request a copy can send a postage stamp of one cent to the Propaganda Department of Yueming Company, Haige Road, and it will be sent immediately. (Missing Character)</p>
<h3>"Film World" Issue 6 Published</h3>
<p>"Film World" Issue 6 was published yesterday, and the content is more beautiful than before. The cover is a still from "Falling Flowers Season" featuring Xu Lai and Zhao Dan. There are also more than a dozen exquisite copperplate prints of Chen Boer, Lu Xiaoxian, Li Minghui, etc. The writing aspect has also been greatly reformed. The magazine includes "Hollywood Husband Taming Techniques" and "Brief Biographies of World Film Practitioners," which are extremely valuable. In addition, "Menstruation," "Chatting About Watching Movies," "Summary of the Film Industry in 1934," and "Talking About Love" are also witty and humorous. Also, the next issue of the publication will be an expanded issue, which will be published on the Lunar New Year's Day.</p>
<p>Note: The two songs "New Woman" and "Whampoa River" have been published with finely printed sheet music. The price is two cents per copy. Readers can cut out the following newspaper stamp, attach five cents of postage, and send a letter to Lianhua Second Factory, Yanping Road, Shanghai, to request a free copy. Only one copy per person.</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3>The Legend of Hong Yang, the Gallant Hero (1) - Produced by Xinhua Film Company</h3>
<p>— Zhao Chu</p>
<p>Amidst a picturesque village scene, nature's beauty abounds. In the distance, two bald donkeys are seen, each carrying two riders, clip-clopping along. They are followed by attendants carrying luggage on their shoulders. The copper bells around the donkeys' necks jingle merrily as they approach.</p>
<p>As they crossed a long bridge, Hong Xiuquan, looking dashing on his donkey, suddenly heard shouts and beatings from the village ahead. He said to Feng Yunshan, "This must be those dog-official lackeys wreaking havoc again. Why don't we go and take a look?" Feng Yunshan agreed, and they reined in their donkeys and dismounted, heading forward. Hong Xiuquan saw that he was right and sighed with indignation, "When will we Han people be able to breathe freely after being oppressed by the Manchus?" Hearing his words, Feng Yunshan immediately said, "Brother Hong! Why are you so discouraged? Don't you believe we'll achieve our ambitions?" Hong shook his head, "As a failed scholar like me, without power above and without the support of the people below, how can we achieve our goals?" Feng quickly replied, "You underestimate yourself. Liu Bang of the Han dynasty and Zhu Yuanzhang of the Ming dynasty, weren't they commoners?" Hong pondered for a moment, then smiled faintly at Feng, "It's true that the times create heroes, and heroes create the times!" Suddenly, Feng Yunshan thought of something and said excitedly, "I heard that Zhu Jiutao in Huaxian has great ambitions and is now establishing the God-Worshipping Society, preaching and spreading doctrine while secretly gathering support to restore the Ming dynasty. Why don't we join that society and act accordingly?" Hong was excited and said, "Since there's such an opportunity, why didn't you say so sooner? Let's join immediately." Feng naturally agreed, and they spurred their donkeys forward, the sound of the bells gradually fading into the distance.</p>
<p>In a bustling marketplace, an official in a green sedan chair, wearing a prominent hat, led a procession, shouting and clearing the way. They knocked a blind fortune-teller to the ground, causing him to crack his head and bleed profusely. Then, they passed in front of a shop, where many items were placed outside. The runners, thinking they were obstructing the procession, kicked the items away, causing them to fall. The shopkeeper hurriedly picked up the scattered items, angrily cursing, "There's no need to bully people like this. We're just doing small business, we haven't broken any laws." As he was cursing, two runners suddenly grabbed him and asked fiercely, "Who are you daring to curse?" The man replied in a panic, "I didn't dare to curse anyone." Without explanation, the runners dragged him away. Hong Xiuquan happened to be passing by and, seeing this scene, indignantly said, "What kind of world is this? Whose world is this?" Hearing this, Feng Yunshan looked around anxiously and pulled Hong Xiuquan's sleeve, and they walked away together.</p>
<p>Inside a classroom, there were more than ten rows of chairs, and the walls were adorned with pictures of Jesus preaching. When Hong and Feng entered, the pianist immediately stopped playing and walked to them, saying, "The master is waiting for you two in the basement." Hong and Feng followed him into the inner room. It was arranged as a library. The two entered and, behind a hidden mechanism, a door appeared. They went down the door into the basement. The basement was not very large. In the middle was an incense table, and in the center was an image of Zhu Hongwu. Zhu Jiutao was leaning on a soft couch, wearing Taoist attire. He was old and looked weak. Seeing the two enter, he greeted them repeatedly. The two took the opportunity to pay their respects to Zhu Jiutao. Zhu Jiutao took a deep breath and slowly said, "I've been spreading doctrine, secretly trying to restore the Ming dynasty. Who knew that after decades, there would be no success? I hate that I am now old and weak, unable to do anything. I am truly sorry to my ancestors." As he spoke, he couldn't help but shed tears. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Necessity of Establishing a History of Architecture</h3>
<p>— Yan Ming</p>
<p>We know that the myriad things in the universe that appear before us, especially those things that provide us humans with clothing, food, housing, transportation... etc., are fundamentally different in their essence and quality from what we see and touch at this moment. Their quality is constantly changing with the evolution of time. Yesterday's apes are today's "civilized" humans; and today's humans are yesterday's apes, covered in hair and unable to speak. From this, we can correctly conclude that it is not just the evolution of humans that is like this, but that everything in the world is subject to time. This kind of change in form due to the limitation of time has invisibly created history. In this era of flourishing science in the 20th century, human life, in addition to having comprehensive, all-encompassing general histories, is also striving for the study of individual, longitudinal histories. Indeed, such tracing of historical traces is too important. It is not only to know the past, but also to develop the future. Architecture is one of the elements that solve the basic needs of human life, especially in modern society, its importance is known to anyone with common sense. However, if we want to trace the past traces of today's architecture, we first need to examine "Architectural History". We certainly need to know about modern architecture, the towering, magnificent modern urban buildings, but we also need to know that our earliest ancestors once "built nests to live in" like birds, and slept in the ground like beasts. This kind of nest-building and ground-dwelling life, modern people, except for historians and archaeologists, probably do not know, nor do they want to know. Although the nest-building and ground-dwelling life of ancient humans was extremely simple and crude, their absolute need for "architecture" to live in was no different from the modern people's comfortable life in high-rise buildings. Modern people only know how to enjoy themselves in high-rise buildings, and do not know that if they had not gone through the stages of "nest-building and living" and "ground-dwelling," where would today's high-rise buildings come from? Similarly, it seems that without going through the stages of eating raw meat and drinking blood, or wearing leaves to protect oneself, there would be no today's full meals and warm clothing: without small carts and sailboats, where would today's ships... airplanes come from? And history tells us the traces of this transition. In the many kinds of history in modern times, we know that there are individual political histories, economic histories, social histories, human war histories... but we cannot find a single, complete history of architecture. Architecture, in modern society, occupies such an important position, and the knowledge about architecture already includes "architecture", but there is no history of architecture, which is a great regret for both the architectural and academic communities. If there are now many people who want to know the traces of the transition of architecture, what should they do? So here, a history of architecture must be established. Only by establishing a history of architecture can the above-mentioned problems be properly solved.</p>
<p>Knowledge of architectural history is a common knowledge that people in modern society, who need architecture to live in, must possess; as for architects and engineering designers, they have always only worked on technical aspects, and have always neglected the extremely important history of architecture. We believe that modern architects and engineering designers, in addition to working on the research and transformation of modern architectural technology, must also have a thorough understanding of the knowledge of architectural history. Because this knowledge belongs to their profession.</p>
<p>Finally, we must also say: the necessity of establishing a history of architecture has been briefly described above; but how to establish a history of architecture - a single, complete history of architecture, this responsibility can only be shouldered by historians who are well-versed in ancient and modern times. This article is only a brief outline, to raise a preliminary awareness of the necessity of establishing a history of architecture.</p>
<h3>Talking About the Architecture of Xiamen</h3>
<p>— Yang Dehui</p>
<p>Xiamen is a large city in the south of our country. Although it is not as good as Guangzhou, it is undoubtedly still a large city besides Guangzhou. Before I talk about the architecture of Xiamen, let me first talk about the relationship between cities and architecture: We know that a kind of architectural style has many backgrounds, such as climate, politics, religion, ethnicity... etc., these are closely related to the style of architecture. Therefore, the changes in urban architecture are not accidental. Because the changes in architecture also have a great relationship with the improvement of materials. In other words, architecture changes due to the progress of science and the civilization of matter. Today's invention of reinforced concrete is why there are skyscrapers. By analogy, the changes in architecture and materials are due to the evolution of the world, and Xiamen is no exception!</p>
<p>The name of Xiamen originated in the twentieth year of Ming Taizu, when Jiangxiahou Zhou Dexing was ordered to build the city as Xiamen City. It is an island surrounded by the sea on all sides, so its territory is mostly hilly and undulating, scattered like pearls, and there are very few plains. The total area of the city is 379,600 square feet. Excluding lowlands, rivers, and foothills, the area that can be built is only 330,000 square feet. If all 181,802 people are proportioned, then the area occupied by each person averages only two square feet. Under this situation, it is obvious that there is a feeling of land scarcity and population density. Unless mountains are opened and land is filled to develop new areas, there is really no way to accommodate the increase in population in the future! Therefore, the municipal authorities have completed the development of 130,000 square feet of new urban areas, and are still continuing to develop them. With the majestic terrain and important location of Xiamen, the development of its architecture is of course what we expected. Because Xiamen is mostly mountainous and has few plains, its architecture is also like that of Hong Kong, especially the buildings in the newly developed urban areas. The buildings in Xiamen can be divided into old and new styles. The old-style buildings are mostly bungalows, and their style is rectangular and very low, which is completely the expression of rural architecture in our country. The two ends of the roof ridge are shaped like dove tails, and the roof is of course sloping. It looks like the architecture of a temple. As for the internal design, entering the gate is a courtyard. Large areas are mostly divided into front and rear houses and left and right廂房. The building materials are completely domestic products. The red ocher bricks and tiles from the Shima area of Zhangzhou are commonly used in the old-style buildings of Xiamen. The wood for pillars, rafters, and floorboards is fir and chestnut wood from the mainland. The walls are made of granite produced from the mountains on the island. The installation of doors and windows mostly does not pay attention to sanitary principles. Here is a special feature: a layer of ocher square bricks is added on the floor to consider fire prevention and heat insulation! Although the old-style architecture of Xiamen is not limited to the style mentioned above, it can indeed represent the general style of old-style architecture in the entire old-style architecture. As for the new-style architecture, it is developing day by day in the city, and it is moving forward very rapidly. Because of the relationship between overseas Chinese and the terrain, the new-style architecture in Xiamen is also becoming more and more prosperous. In terms of the style and raw materials of the structure, we strive for modernization and solidity. Therefore, in the past, the busy center was located in the southwest corner, but since the development of the new area, it has gradually moved to the new area. This is because the buildings in the new area are mostly newly built, and the newly built styles are of course different from the old styles, and they are moving towards the new era of new-style architecture. Therefore, in the past five years, there have been 4,000 new-style buildings in the new area. The only reason for the emergence of this new-style architecture is that it is influenced by modern life. Moreover, the concentration of modern cities is mostly in industrial and commercial enterprises, so the surge in population has also made the architecture tend towards new styles. Because of this, the new buildings in Xiamen are at least two stories, and there are now many four- or five-story high-rise buildings that have been completed! Its style is adopted from Hong Kong, and the sidewalks on both sides of the road are all built with arcades. The width of each house is usually one or two feet, which looks like a pigeon cage. As for the building materials, they are all reinforced concrete to ensure solidity. With the advancement of the wheels of the times, the architectural style is gradually being renewed. In Xiamen, it is in the process of vigorous development. Moreover, its coastal embankment is now being actively carried out. After the entire project is completed in the future, the future of its architectural industry will not be difficult to imagine that it will be even more developed than it is today.</p>
<p>(Editor's note) (1) Although there are many mountains on Xiamen Island, the new city is still completely plain. The so-called "hilly and undulating" is on Gulangyu, opposite Xiamen; (2) Active construction; the renovation of the city appearance was still a matter of three years ago, when it was handled by the Zhangxia Garrison Command, which was quite large-scale. In the past two years, there has been no progress; (3) The coastal embankment cost millions of construction fees and four or five years of time to complete, but it has been in a state of stagnation in the past year. Xia Island is a place I used to travel to, and I am more familiar with the situation, so I have attached this note.</p>
<h3>The Study of Building Materials (1)</h3>
<p>— Zhu Zhenmu</p>
<p>Chapter 1 General Discussion</p>
<p>Section 1 Scope</p>
<p>The scope of the study of building materials is limited to the materials necessary for building application. The contents described in this article can be roughly divided into four categories:</p>
<p>1. A sketch of the raw materials and manufacturing methods of materials;</p>
<p>2. An introduction to the general and special properties of materials;</p>
<p>3. Recognition of the necessary conditions for various applications of materials;</p>
<p>4. A glimpse of the methods of material testing.</p>
<p>Other market conditions and general practices will also be included as much as possible within the author's limited knowledge, in order to contribute a personal opinion.</p>
<p>Section 2 Properties of Building Materials</p>
<p>There are many properties of materials that can be discussed. Here, we select the properties that are useful in construction engineering and worthy of our attention, list the items, and explain them as follows:</p>
<p>1. Strength - This is the ability of the material, showing its ability to withstand external forces to a certain extent and still be able to support itself without falling. There are five types of this strength that are commonly used, namely (A) tensile strength, (B) compressive strength, (C) shear strength, (D) bending strength (which is a mixture of tensile strength and compressive strength), and (E) torsional strength.</p>
<p>2. Elasticity - This is a characteristic of a material that, after being deformed by external force, can restore its original shape when the external force is removed.</p>
<p>3. Degree of solidity - This is the property of a material to withstand external force without changing its shape.</p>
<p>4. Degree of fragility and brittleness - This is the property of a material to split in shape when subjected to external force.</p>
<p>5. Toughness - This is the characteristic of a material to withstand external force to a great degree of deformation and still not break.</p>
<p>6. Hardness - This is the characteristic of a material to withstand scribing and cutting.</p>
<p>7. Malleability - This is the characteristic of a material to be able to extend like taffy without breaking.</p>
<p>8. Ductility - This is the characteristic of a material to be able to be extended into extremely thin sheets.</p>
<p>9. Durability - This is the characteristic of a material to resist external erosion and protect its lifespan, such as rust, woodworm, and exposure to wind and frost, all of which belong to this category.</p>
<p>10. Conductivity and magnetism - Electrical wires in building materials must have this characteristic.</p>
<p>Section 3 Requirements for Building Materials</p>
<p>In addition to various characteristics that should be considered, there are four requirements for the selection of building materials:</p>
<p>1. Appropriateness - That is, all kinds of characteristics meet the needs, but it is common that they are not suitable for application due to high price or insufficient material. Whether it is appropriate must be carefully considered.</p>
<p>2. Accessibility - Sometimes the application of materials is difficult to purchase due to excessive distance from the place of origin, inconvenient transportation, or insufficient output to meet demand.</p>
<p>3. Harmony - The internal structure of the material must be integrated in order to be able to withstand the resistance of external forces, so as not to enter due to slight weaknesses and render the entire material useless.</p>
<p>4. Reliability - Special attention should be paid to whether all the above properties and requirements are reliable.</p>
<h3>Architectural Jargon (4)</h3>
<p>— Mei Zhenhuan</p>
<p>—Regarding use in the construction site—</p>
<p>堂子 (Tangzi) - The word "堂子 (Tangzi)" in the eyes of a certain class of people in Shanghai, may require over-sensitive speculation about the so-called 堂子 in brothels (that is, the meaning of brothel). In fact, the 堂子 (Frame) that we are talking about now is the wooden frame of the door (Door) or window. When building a house and reaching the first-floor plane line, according to the drawings, assuming there is a door, then at this time, the 堂子 should be erected. The term used in the construction site is 立堂子 (Li Tangzi - to erect the frame).</p>
<p>羊角 (Yangjiao) - The edge post (Side Style) of the 堂子 (Tangzi).</p>
<p>There are gaps left on both sides close to the outside. These gaps and the wall are connected firmly with 羊角 (Wooden Dowel) so that the 堂子 does not shake. It is made of wood. The method is to bury one end in the wall and the other end in the 堂子.</p>
<p>穿弓 (Chuan Gong)! - 穿弓 (Section) is not a bow used to shoot arrows, but the cross-sectional sample drawn by the architect.</p>
<p>翻水 (Fan Shui) - (Slope) For example, in the inner courtyard or kitchen of a house, a flat roof surface, a gutter, or other places where water may leak, the plane must be somewhat inclined. The reason for this inclination is to make it easier for the water to flow away.</p>
<p>浸 (Jin) - Most of the properties of bricks are dry and hot, so before building a wall, they are soaked in water in advance to make them thoroughly wet. Then, the bricks used for building the wall are called 浸磚 (Jin Zhuan - soaked bricks).</p>
<p>磉皮 (Sang Pi) - (Support) The foundation stone used for the columns of ordinary houses. The more elaborate ones have a round stone step on the column body, which is the 磉子 (Sangzi - column base).</p>
<p>凹綫 (Ao Xian) - (Fillet) The triangular line of the negative angle where the skirting line (Skirting) and the floor (Floor) meet.</p>
<p>台度 (Tai Du) - (Dado) What is 台度? It is a kind of lining suitable for kitchens to avoid damage or fire hazard to the wall. It is generally made of yellow sand cement and is more than five feet high and less than eight feet high. However, now it is often used as a decorative lining, such as in corridors or guest rooms. But it is made of foreign pine and Liu'an wood, and even teak is also used as 台度.</p>
<p>出綫 (Chu Xian) - Like the capping (Coping) on the parapet wall (Parapet), the eaves (Eave), or the small round line under the window sill (Window Sill), these are called 出綫 (Chu Xian - projecting line). They are also called 水落綫 (Shui Luo Xian - drip).</p>
<p>台形 (Tai Xing) - There is a saying among the so-called playboys in Shanghai called "着台形 (Zhe Tai Xing)", which means to save face. However, in the construction site, the word 台形 is not explained in this way. It is a kind of auxiliary equipment to help another thing. It is also commonly called 惠林 (Hui Lin - whaling).</p>
<p>送椿 (Song Chun) - (Following File) When driving piles to the ground but not reaching the original level line, it is necessary to rely on 送椿.</p>
<p>椿箍 (Chun Gu) - (Iron Hoop) To prevent wooden piles from breaking easily after being hit by weight, an iron hoop is placed on top of the pile.</p>
<p>元規 (Yuan Gui) - (Compass) is a kind of instrument used by architects to draw patterns, shaped like a pointed fork, so it is also called 肩义 (Jian Yi - shoulder fork). In fact, there is another kind of instrument called 肩义.</p>
<p>開賬 (Kai Zhang) - The constructor (Constrator) takes out the appearance of the house from the drawing room or the owner (that is, the owner). The constructor must seriously calculate and quote a price for it. This is called 開賬 (Kai Zhang - opening an account). If the cost is confirmed and the constructor is selected to do it, it can no longer be called 開賬. So what is it called? The term used in the construction site is "拆賬 (Chai Zhang - breaking down the account)".</p>
<p>居壁架 (Ju Bi Jia) - (Shelf) A triangular frame made of wood, commonly used in kitchens or canteens, with a board laid on top, can be used to place things.</p>
