<p>設美國購銀果。能盡如銀派議員之。希望達到金三銀一之。比銀價亦得至一元以上則後此銀價作。何處置乎若任其變遷則此。刻之提高為多事若逼令世界盡用。複本位制又豈能盡如美國之望若繼續。維持其價格則恐為力亦有時而窮蓋物價。雖可以人力相操縱祇可行之於。一時終不敵自然力之偉大面能恒久不移故。非世界各國自動對銀有需要美國銀。派議員魄力縱偉大終難穩定白銀之價格。且美國提高銀價之最大。目標為中國而此一年來究如何乎白。銀輸出能如美國所預斯滔滔以。去雖有紳士恊定而以大利。所在海。外銀市仍常有中國賣出中國。白銀之外洩愈多中國金融。市塲之阢陧愈甚而對外貿易之不振與美。國所期望者乃正得其反今中國經濟殆至不能振作之地步眈眈者又。大有人在設合縱果成事實市。塲竟造成割據之局屆時美國縱深悔購銀政。策之無謂亦已無及矣。</p>

<p>乃德洗過了身子，幷且好好裹上條毯子坐在火爐旁邊，納綏就為他剪髮，其後又到了另一批孩子，就被關進在浴室裏，只聽到裏面一陣拍水之聲，正似一羣小鯨魚在耍戲呢。</p>
<p>乃德還是躺在這裏罷，這末，他晚上咳的時候，你可以拿大量的胡麻子汁給他喝，」裴夫人道，她奔來奔去，正像一個母雞忙着要管一大羣活動不息的小雛。</p>
<p>納綏贊成那個計畫，即以一件佛蘭絨的睡衣給乃德穿上，飲以一些溫暖而甜蜜的東西，然後將他捲入在房裏二張中之一張。他矚在床上，竟像了一個恬然章滿的木乃伊，覺得他已享盡了人間的安樂了。淸潔的本身便是一種新鮮而愉快的感覺；在他所處的世界裏，佛蘭絨睡衣固從未聽到過；幾句溫慰的方辭潤澤了他枯寂的心懷；幾啜的「好東西」平了他的咳嗽，其愉快正復相同；而有人照顧的感覺，使那樸素的房間，從無家可依的小孩看去，竟不啻是一所天堂。這像是一個黑甜的夢境。，他屢次閉起他的眼睛，一試張開之後此種情境是否竟至幻滅。旣然證明了這不是幻象，歡樂之情益使他不易睡去，即使勉欲睡去實亦有所不可，因為在這幾分鍊裏，梅莊的一種希奇的制度，文呈現到他驚異而郤能賞鑑的眼前。</p>

<p>— 孫壽成</p>
<p>舊同學黃心貽，近在邯鄲，因思黃梁夢之典故，出於該縣，故去函請其就近琛詢此事之原委，昨蒙來函，敘述其詳，轉錄如下，以告閱者，以下皆黃君所說：</p>
<p>黃梁夢，河北邯鄲縣之一鎮也，原名王化堡，以李泌「枕中記」，敘盧生黃梁夢事，得著名於世，久之真名反掩，今人多直呼其鎮曰黃梁夢，不復知有舊名，惟平漢鐵路經此設一站，仍名王化堡。余按枕中記所載，略謂：「有盧生者，熱中富貴，壯歲猶未成名，心殊悒悒，一日遇呂翁於旅舍，翁方自炊黃梁以一枕授生曰，枕此當能如願，生受枕之，旋夢登科及第，娶於博陵崔氏，女美甚，從此功業顯達，出將入相者數十年，甲第連雲，極盡聲色之奉，自不知身在夢中，迨一夕老病死，其夢忽醒，視呂翁在側炊黃梁尚未熟也。」此記所述，其為事實，抑係寓言，我非夢中人，固不敢加以武斷，惟即就斯文立意之妙，感人之深，初不必世有真仙，真有斯夢作者殆已具有仙骨矣。蒲留仙著聊齋，作續黃梁，洩忿一時，刻劃盡致，反成狗尾。余今春適旅邯鄲，辛獲遊此勝境。該鎮離城十二里，當年遺跡，今已建作呂翁祠，門臨燕趙孔道，祠額曰「邯鄲古觀」，門內高墻，嵌有石刻，大書「逢萊仙境」四字，筆勢矯捷，飛騰欲活，云係仙筆。再進即為正殿，中供呂仙塑像，儒服負劍，氣宇瀟灑，不減書生風度，望之不禁悠然，令人亦將作出塵之想。正殿之前，折而左，則另一院落，十畝池塘，曲橋碧檻，亭榭清幽，頗堪流覽。臨池又高建一殿，中供漢鍾離塑像，巨腹便便，了結瞪目，非但毫無仙氣，直近魔道。道士告余曰：鍾離氏係呂仙之師，故並祀之，余曰：此間既並祀呂仙之師，理應亦兼祀呂仙之徒，余素知呂仙高足有柳樹精者，今胡覺缺席，不令嫓美宣尼之四配十哲，未免不公。道士皆笑，此殿之後，乃盧生祠，云即當年旅舍中炊黃梁處，今內供盧生臥像，像以整塊巨石，連座琢成，大如人體，儒巾儒服，支一臂椅枕而寐，迄今仍未醒也。審其石刻，精美而不織巧，殆宋金遺物。凡來此憑弔者，對此臥像，莫不麼挲興感，流連不忍捨去，歷年既久，像乃黝然滑澤，光可鑒人。邯鄲境內碑版絕少，惟此祠獨多石刻，均係歷代名人題詩，嵌滿四壁，幾無隙處，讀之頗多名句。因其觀感之深，故發言亦多寄慨遙深之語，景物移人，一至於此，余碌碌風塵，久廢吟詠，至此亦如有所感，詩意油然，歸途得七絕一首：曰「炊熟黃梁已許時，我來借枕恐嫌遲，自知未具神仙福，敢對先生舉酒巵。」蓋呂仙嘗醉岳陽，余同嗜也。至所謂黃梁者，既今之小米，至今邯鄲居民，仍以此炊飯，飯作黃色，故曰黃粱</p>

<p>「一個和尚挑水吃，兩個和尚槓水吃，三個和尚沒（解無）水吃」；這是形容依賴性的人們，一種懶散習慣，人手愈多，工作成效愈低；其實這是指按月計薪的職工而言，假使拿挑水多寡為獲得代價做標準，每個人便有向上心了；挑水夫是勞力之一種，誠不下於中國古今大家認為最辛苦的打鐵，撐船，磨豆腐呢；打鐵，撐船，磨豆腐，是卜畫卜夜的操作，挑水是一根毛孔粒汗珠兒，好比半斤對八兩呀；都市裏有的是自來水，用不到這項苦力，內地小城市，老虎灶，洗澡堂，是他們大宗的主顧，每個住戶，也少不了他們的踪跡，他們怕陰雨連綿，大家儲藏着「天落水」，他們便有枵腹之虞了！每年期望個「暖水場」，因為有了吃水，還要用水，這夏天的「暖水場」，是他們黃金時代；逼近公河的居戶，一担水賣銅板兩枚，可是城裏水就寶貴了，挑夫沒有這般長的肩力，挑兩桶水，要潑掉小半桶，所以城裏人家是推水夫：眼見有條玉帶河，只是和西湖的樓外樓天外天一樣的騙人而已，自流井呢，不見得家家都有，因此挑水夫成了專門職業：我們這條街上，挑水的「小大子」，是無人不知無人不曉的，他是揚中縣太平廳的人，聲調特別清脆，大家見了他都笑着道：「小大子」，唱一個，他不擺架子，接上去就哼了；他讀過千字文，能唱七字句的梁山泊祝英台，他恐怕有人錯換了他的水桶，在桶的兩邊，寫上「小大子」「小大子」六個大字，這好像他的無敵商標一般；他吃的千家飯，用的百家錢，他春夏秋都裸着半節身子，偶然穿起湖南漂的白短衫褲，老布鞋襪，他反失了廬山真面目，頑皮的小孩子，見了尋開心的說：小大子，你做新郎官呀！</p>

<p>荷花越是開放得大，那股香味便越發越激烈。</p>
<p>小鳥們也聞到香味了，都從各方飛過來，儘在那一堆荷叢上低飛着：它們的翅膀在空氣中不停的鼓動，又發生了一種不可思議的功用，就是那陣荷香竟被它們幫着吹過來了，便我們分外容易聞到。</p>
<p>太陽越升越高，光芒也漸漸的強烈了，湖上的一切，全給陽光揭露了開來。</p>
<p>現在我們已可以看見那些荷花中的粉紅色的花蕊了！——不過這時候它們還不曾完全開放，依舊保留着蓓蕾的本色，它們似乎是在期待什麼，衹把香味盡景透出來，仍不願畢露色相。</p>
<p>「啊！這是多麼有趣的一片奇景啊！」老佛爺又獨自說起話來了。「而且一片充滿着生氣的奇景！人在這種時候，才會感到大自然的美妙和可愛，並且可以知道一切有生命的東西，和我們人類都有相當的關系…………。」</p>
<p>伊的話音是又低又柔和，以下的話，簡直就像這樣含糊過去了；原來伊自己也已驚覺方才那幾句話實在說得太不順口，而且也太欠理了，因此便故意的含糊過去。其實我們這些人誰也沒有留神聽伊的話，大家都已受了眼睛的欺騙，以為有這麼許多的荷花同時在舒放着，想必真有一種美妙的聲響可以聽到，所以船上的人，個個已像我一樣的在側着耳朶細聆「荷聲」了。（三八九）</p>

<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十七回　莫問女兒身難言隱痛爭看貴人臉共仰高風</p>
<p>浣花了紅了臉站起來道：那麼，我實在多謝。說着，一鞠躬而去，他走出了房門，還聽到志前歎了一口氣。至於他是那一種歎息的意味，却不去管他。正一扭轉身子，要向外走，忽然後面有很急的腳步聲趕了前來，接着被人一把扯住了衣襟。回頭看着張介夫又換了一副笑嘻嘻的樣子站在面前。他笑道：我仔細想了一想，你要我幫忙，我一點也不答應，那好像太對不住你。說着把聲音似了一低道：你今天晚上十二點鍾來，我送你一點小欵子。浣花淡淡的笑道：小欵子？這小到什麼程度呢？張介夫也笑道：兩三塊錢，我也總要送你。浣花鼻子裏一哼，笑道：留着你買飯吃罷。說着，一扭身子就走開了。張介夫呆站在這裏。半天動不得，浣花那裏管他，自向外院走了去。自然也是高興的回家。可是到了飯店門中，却見一位年輕的婦人，隨着兩件行李，笑嘻嘻的走了進來。他一面走着一面操着南京腔笑道：這裏的房錢，倒也是不怎麼貴，還抵不了在南京住小客棧的價錢呢。我就住下去三四個月也不要緊。在他說話的當中，那高跟鞋子得得作響，充滿了他那分得意的情形。浣花這就想着，當年我到西安，何嘗不是這樣高興，可是到現在，是把這小西天當了火坑，很不容易得有明日的機會，總算可以跳了出去了。然而還有這樣的人，願意在這火坑裏住上幾個月呢。（二八九）</p>

<h3 id="c188">關於「野性的呼聲」及其他 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— 斯嘯</p>
<p>傑克倫敦的「野性的呼聲」，今年出版了兩種中譯本：一是中華本劉大杰張夢　合譯，另一是商務本谷風歐陽山合譯。世界文庫第一集的目錄裏，也列有這一本書。而這幾天報紙的電影廣吿又吿訴我們，它不僅已在好萊塢攝成了電影，而且要在上海的銀幕上映演了。這對於傑克倫敦，尤其是「野性的呼聲」的愛讀者，該是一種愉快吧。我呢，還不僅僅是如此的。</p>
<p>記得是一九二八年的冬天，讀到了一本批評美國文學的小册子，便依照所推薦的書目，托當時正在某大學圖書館做事的朋友毓驄，順便到美國去定買了幾本，討個不必先付一文現錢又可折價較輕的便宜。這幾本書裏面，有兩本是傑克倫教的。「鐵踵」和「野性的呼聲」。</p>
<p>隨後，在上海的西書舖裏，自己陸續又買了幾本倫敦的著作。有一本名呌War　of　the　Clas·es的，當時極想一讀，而苦於買不到手。有一天跟毓驄說起了，他便以一個熱習上海書市的人的口吻，再加上他慣有的那種稚氣的誇口，堅持着說一定有，問題只是我不會找罷了。我是知道他好勝的脾氣，又最高興在這些事上為朋友麻煩，可因為彼此太熟，反不適用懇托代找的方式，所以雖然明知道他找書的本領比我强得多而又多，還是故意搗亂着激動他，速說决不會有。他不作聲，擺出一副「你等着瞧罷」的神氣，走了，隔不到一個星期，一天早上，我和純如還剛起身洗過臉，在朋友中出名呌「蔡大塊頭」的毓驄，滿頭犬汗，氣喘不息的，跑了來。奇怪的是，一臉得意的神色，右手又挾住大衣的腋部，裏面一定藏着什麽在，可無論如何不肯給看。一定有着什麼使人高興的秘密了，是不必說的。於是，照老例，倒茶，敬烟，請吃一點東西，再說上若千使他高興的話，好容易把這個大孩子哄够子，這才慢慢地公開了秘藏的東西，看，原來便是那一本教想得而得不到的書！可是，這一回他也够麻煩了，爲了這一本書，他幾乎跑遍了上海新舊的西書舖，最後還是以圖書館熟人的面子，呌商務印書館的售貨員一直爬到書堆角裏去找出來的。</p>
<p>曉得我和純如在熱心地讀着倫敦的作品，另一個朋友，含戈，去到日本之後，從東京的舊書舖裏，找集了一批倫敦的書，寄了來。眞够我們讀的了！後來，我們選擇出幾個短篇小說來翻譯。再後來，純如獨自譯「野性的呼聲」。這時，她學着日文。已經回國的含戈知道了之後，又特地轉輾去為她找了東京叢文閣版　利彥的日譯本來。</p>
<p>曾經有一個時期，「野性的呼聲」的故事，以及它主人公呌做布克的那條狗，成為純如和我每晚工作之餘的談話中心，那些話常是稚氣得可笑的。——但我不想在這裏說這些了，我想說的是：一九三〇年秋，含戈死。次年，病了一年的純如死。再下一年，一野性的呼聲」譯稿散失於一二八之戰；秋天，毓驄也死了。</p>
<p>那樣聚集起來的二十多本倫教的著作，在散失了一小部分之後，餘下的那些却像不願跑散似的，至今還呆守着我的書架。</p>
<p>曾經被本國人駡作「紅衫」（red-chitt）「炸藥手」（dynamiler）和「亂黨」（anarehist），而又被世界文人譽為「美國高爾基」的傑克倫敦，「野性的呼聲」是他的成名之作，足以為他某一方面的作品的代表，可决不能如有些人那樣說是高過他一切作品的壓卷之作的。</p>
<p>「野性的呼聲」出版於一九〇三年，作者二十八歲。這之前，自從二十二歲那年老遠老遠跑到冰天雪地的克隆帶克（Koudike）金礦發見的那一帶地方去，發財未成重回故鄉之後，他肩上負了家庭生活重担，便開始埋育寫小說賣錢。雖然稿費從每篇五塊金洋，漲到七槐半，又漲到每字二分，但生活依然難以維持。另一方面，所作也沒什麼成功，一九〇〇年到一九〇二年所出的他最初的五本集子，是在五家書店出版的。一九〇〇年三月一日他寫給一個朋友的信上，說到他的寫作生活道：「我是為錢寫作；如果我能獲得名聲，那便等於多一點錢。多一點錢，對於我便等於多一點生活。我將常恨着賺錢的工作；每次我坐下來寫作，總帶了大大的厭惡。」一九〇二年他又在信上吿訴這同一個朋友，說他一家五口得養活，不知道會不會有淸償債務的時候了。</p>
<p>但「野性的呼聲」一出版，對於倫敦早期作品毫不關心的批評家，都一致加以讀譽，倫敦於是聲名大噪，確立了作家的地位。此後他才變得更有力，產生以「鐵踵一為代表的另一個方面的更偉大的諸作。</p>
<p>「野性的呼聲一是一篇以一條名呌布克的狗做主人公的中篇小說。據他一九〇三年三月十三日給一個朋友的信上所說，他本來只打算寫四千字，作為前此所寫「勃太爾」（Batard）那篇狗小說的姊妹篇的，但一寫起來，筆却停不住，直寫了三萬二千字才好容易吿了結束。根據了自己到克降帶克去的見聞，再參考了一本「我的北地狗」（My　Dogs　of　the　Northland，byEgerton　R·Young），倫敦便在這小說中創造出了那條生長在舊金山，過慣貴族生活的馴良的家狗，布克，呌他被人偷了賣到克隆帶克那一帶發着淘金狂的地方去；拖冰車的工作旣極艱苦，冰雪寒風的自然環境又極險惡，而管車人的棍棒，同類的牙齒，更幾乎隨時可以奪去生命——布克好容易適應了這環境，同時他馴性漸减，本來存在心靈最深處的那種遠祖傳下來的野性也逐漸復活，終於成為一匹純眞的野狗，跟狼之類的野獸，一同過着原始的生活了。倫敦在環境的描寫上，在布克的性格的發展上，以及情節的開展上，都是極其成功。雖然是一匹狗，這布克可在倫敦的筆下完全是一個人，那麽呌人愛得像愛一個知友似的。</p>
<p>「野性的呼聲」上方面是那樣呌人讀得丢不下手，另一方面作者特有的那種剛儲簡鍊的文筆也在這一裏，出色地運用着。大槪因為兼具這兩種優點之故吧，這一本書先後被美英德日等國採作英文敎科書用。作者的母校加省大學曾一經用過。日本文學家有島武郞敎英文時也用過。課堂之外的讀者，當然更是多之又多。據美國哥倫比亞大學文理科恊會所編美國銷行最廣書籍的統計。一野性的呼聲」自出版到去年，一共銷了一百四十一萬二千册，佔六十年來銷行最廣書的第十位，也可見這本書風行的一斑了？</p>
<h3 id="c189">海邊的悲劇（三） <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— 法國巴爾扎克原著王堅生譯</p>
<p>這位漁人，這位舟子，這位粗魯的勃萊登人是崇高的，我知道，可是我不知道什麽原因。他那兩隻限哭過麽？那一隻如一個粗粗　成的石　的手，曾經揮動過麽？那粗糙堅毅而略帶溫柔的，那縐紋深疊的額角與偉大的心靈和諧麽？為什麽那人坐在那兒的花崗石當中？為什麽那座花崗石會變為人，那是人，那是石？</p>
<p>複雜的思潮盤旋在我們的腦中。終如我們的嚮鄉所預料，我們在沉獻中迅速前進着，當我們邂逅時，他必已看見我們充滿了恐怖和驚奇，但是他並不以他的預言的眞確和我們抗辯；他只是說」</p>
<p>「你們看見了那人麽？」</p>
<p>「那人是誰。」</p>
<p>「人都呌他為發誓的人。」</p>
<p>你可以想像到聽見這句話後我們的目光轉注到那漁人時的動作！他是，個單純的人。他了解我們無聲的問答，這就是那位嚮導吿訴我們的故事。我要竭力保持他自己的話和這故事中的普通的特質。</p>
<p>『夫人，娜克羅亦錫克和拔突斯地方的人，都深信着那人已經犯了一件罪，他遠至蘭突斯一個著名的牧師處，向他去懺悔。別人都相信着柴勃拉梅——那是他的名字——着了魔，會向那班經過他面走前到避風之處的任何人施法。為這個原因，好多人當他們經過這盤石前，必得看看風是在那一方。假使那兒有疾風，「漁夫手指着西北方，」他們就得作罷，他們畏懼，只得轉身回去了。別的娜克羅亦錫克地方的富翁都說柴勃拉梅曾經立了誓願，所以他被稱為「發誓的人。」他終日在那裏，從不他去。這種談話有相當的眞實，』他說着轉身過來，指看一件我們以前未曾注意過的東西，「那兒，左邊，他曾豎立起一個木十字架，表示着他是在上帝聖母和先知的庇護之下。他决不會像現在一樣孤獨，如果他不造成那樣使每人都怕的恐怖，因而使他自己好像被一團兵保護一樣地安全。自從他將自己禁鉀起來，他未有片語，他全賴麵包和水以生活，這麵包和水是他兄弟的孩子——一個十二歲的小女孩——每天淸晨送來的，他發願將他全部的家產貨物遺留給她——她也是一個美麗的孩子，一個小女兒。和綿羊一樣柔馴，被人家十分讚美。她的眼睛藍而長」，他說，豎起他的姆指。</p>
<h3 id="c190">峽中行（上） <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 鄔方</p>
<p>沿着江的路，漸次窄起來了。兩岸聳起的山峯，也顯得特別高，特別陡險。靑色的江流，加大地發着吼聲；濺在崖石上的水花，跳得頂是猛厲。起初還以為風景雄壯哩，隨後便感到有些兒害怕了。一面走一面想，假如有山賊的話，便該出在這些地方吧？</p>
<p>我的旅伴，一個笨拙的鄕下人，埋着頭不言不語只顧趕路的，到這時却像有些靈活了，嘴上一股勁地吹着口哨子，神情煞是高興！</p>
<p>「喂，老哥，你不怕麼？」</p>
<p>我望着他那躭有一塊重包袱的背，一邊尾着走，一邊這麽問他。</p>
<p>「我怕啥子？……放心，這一帶頂淸靜！」</p>
<p>話雖是這樣回答着，但他那掉回頭來的眼睛，閃在濃黑唇毛下面的，忽地流露出兩股狡猾的微笑的光芒，却反而使我感到有些不安了。</p>
<p>他昂着頭，邁著穩愼的步子，依舊朝前走他的，嘴上的口哨兒，則越發來得響亮了，彷彿一個鄕下人突然發了財喜那麽得意似的。</p>
<p>這時眞有點失悔：我似乎把他認錯了，而且前一天不該那麼坦白地對待他。可是，這又怎麽看得出來呢，講起話來，樣子現得怯生生的，活像一個才出遠門的鄕下人。你問一句，他才答一句，不問，他就低下頭啣着他的早烟管，把烟枝叭得吱吱地發響，全不用眼睛溜別人。對於這樣的老實傢伙，眞心說一句，我中意了。昨夜聽見山中店老板揚一揚手說：</p>
<p>「都是到馬街去的，今晚一塊睡吧，明天還同路哩……」</p>
<p>我頂高興了，有這一個同路的旅伴，便客氣對他點一點下巴尖，做出歡喜他的眼色。睡的時候，他把那笨重的包袱放在枕下，又用脫下的衣衫去包裹了一圈，似乎對我頂不放心的光景，我暗地覺得好笑起來：這個笨拙的鄉下人，晚上他總不大睡得熟，時時翻身，好像怕他的東西，會在熟睡的當兒，給我乘機偷去的一樣。我為了要使這個可憐的傢伙安心起見，便同他搭話起來，趁勢吹一點於我無損於他有益的牛，講我也和他一樣，是一個做生意的，目前正到馬街去辦一點子貨。而他也漸次向我問到平原里的蠶豆，是不是已經開了花，芸苔的葉子，是不是長得肥大的話。</p>
<p>這樣講着講着，大家便睡得十分好了。</p>
<p>早上，天一見亮，我見他醒來，就馬上摸一摸他枕下的包袱，並且將弄鬆了的地方，再加拴紥的時候，趕緊揀我一眼，用身子遮着像是怕我瞧見里面包的財喜一樣。我掉開頭去，一面披衣，一面心里暗自發笑：這笨拙的鄕下人！</p>
<p>大約覺出他的包袱，還是原封不動吧，吃早飯的時候，就現出比昨夜更加親密的臉色來了，而且將他自己做好的一份包殼飯搬來和我一塊吃，對我點一點筷子：</p>
<p>我見他在相信我了，我就同他越發要好。因為，這一來，在要單獨走去的山路上，便不會太枯燥太寂寞了。</p>
<p>動身時，店門外遠遠近近的山谷，都濛着一層春天早上的薄霧，潤溫的空氣，十分凉人的肌膚。我的旅伴，嗅一嗅鼻子，帶着非常羨慕的神氣，自言自語道：</p>
<p>「唔，這又甜又溫的天氣；麥子包長得好呀！」</p>
<p>我順便就問他爲什麽不到平原那面去種田的話來。</p>
<p>他並不立即回答我，深深地望我一下，才這麼說道：</p>
<p>「做生意是很好的哪！」</p>
<p>我說，我看你一定是高興種用的。</p>
<p>他沒有理我，只是高聲說：</p>
<p>「今天的天氣實在好走路哩！」</p>
<p>他就是這麽一個不大談話的人。</p>
<p>但是，現在來到這個山峽中，我才覺得有點失悔起來：這個傢伙，要說是笨拙的鄉下人，實在有點不對了。他那麼一付狡猾帶笑的眼睛，那麼一付突然高興起來的神情，的確使人不大放心的。不過從他那沉重的包袱看來，却又不能把他眞的當作匪徒。也許他剛才那樣的神情，無非做出來嚇我，開開玩笑罷了。不然，這一路，如果確有什麼山賊的話，他也沒有理由來高興的。這麼一來，我也漸漸不大介意了，並且，還還跟着他吹起口哨子。</p>
<h3 id="c191">山客 <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— 徐盈</p>
<p>山峯重重，禿着頂綠色植物在石塊上分佈着，東一點西一點地像癬疥。北方的山嶺多是枯瘦的，靑灰色怪石參差地暴露着近似骨骼。在其上，動物的足跡是踏出了弧綫的路，經常的，路上走着重載的瘦馿，背着荆條長筐滿裝着果子的人——但些都是山客。</p>
<p>山客是作為原始運輸的一種行脚人，他們穿着了原始的服裝，由那自耕自足的家庭裏生產出來的藍布衣褲，雙臉鞋和荷包烟袋。有一個强健的身體和一張　質的臉子，但那雙呆板的眼神中却時常露出了警機色彩。</p>
<p>他們，總是三五個成羣結隊地絡繹地在山叢中隱隱現現地出沒着，一個山又一個山地，橫躍地或環。地，從容不迫地趕着路</p>
<p>這都是一些老於走山的人。自從小時候起，便跑山如平地一樣的牧牛，長大後，又開始走一點長路作鍜鍊，等到背起荆條筐子拿起山棍來正式作一個山客」時，那已經是烈日下走個百八十里且可以不吃一口水的硬壯漢子了。　　羣硬壯漢子從農山底，把村落裏的貨路運輸出來，一年中除了冬季的休閒之外，他們總楚來而又往的踏着山徑。先是否子，桃子，李子，天熱後則又是核桃，杏乾子，這中間有時為在雨季山路過滑而停兩三週，之後則是山楂，黑棗，與杮子的季節了。……這是山客們的山貨。</p>
<p>這些人由於在路上朝夕見面，縱然是因為有習慣上商人的隔膜，但是環境的艱苦使他們大部分漸漸認　結仆，而能互助了。　如在小店中的坐更，深山茂草中的防狼，特別是遠足中心靈上的寂寞，山客們是能够合作的。</p>
<p>日當午，如果走到山　裏，又恰好這地邊上有幾株核桃樹，或大葉櫟樹，濃陰，舖蓋在地上時，山客們便停下來憇憇脚。有的自己下了背包，有的給馿子卸筐，有的遙遠便和地主人打招呼索要一些山泉，且讓馿子優然地在石縫裏找點靑草吃。</p>
<p>倚在大石頭的斜面上，吸着大葉子烟，扯閒天。</p>
<p>談話的範圍總不出乎身邊幾伴瑣事，有如天氣變化，山貨收穫，成色，路上的惡險。若是恰好　地方牆上有用石灰劃的白圈，那麽話題便會扯到兒狼」，從狼的顏色一直談到那載貨馿子的頸下，幾個驚狼鈴鐺。</p>
<p>有時候，有人便掏出乾糧來，就着凉水吃，一壁吃一壁說，討論着大餅捲大葱和玉米窩頭耐久力的比較。又有時，人們便被一二個新穎一點的故事吸引着：</p>
<p>「有一回為了多趕幾步路，我便遇了魔——笑什麽，你們年靑人有老年人經騐多嗎？天一晚，起了魔。</p>
<p>「魔像一堵牆，又像一片烟，摸摸什麽都沒有，可是你就永遠走不出，那堵烟牆永遠在你前面，牲畜一死兒地叫，死打死不走，我打火石取個火，怎麽也打不着。</p>
<p>「我心下眞起急，月黑天，怎麽也等不到亮，心說這批柿子送不到，誤了下鍋烘，這趟脚是白跑了，我性子起來先是駡，後來就許下願來禱吿——這樣魔才退，我跟着一盞鬼火才繞出那堵牆，誰說沒有魔，我親眼見的……」</p>
<p>烟罷水足之後，便又上了裝，嘻嘻哈哈地照舊趕路。到了目的地後，卸了貨，但筐子裏仍舊是充實着回去，這時候其中是煤油，鐵器，洋綫代替了「十產二品」。</p>
<p>這些便是山客」。</p>

<h3 id="c192">收回牯嶺英租地 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>交涉已久的收回牯嶺英租地事，現已告一段落，於本有八日，由我國代表將志澄，與英總領事默斯，共同簽字。其協定內容為：（一）將一九零五年英人租地契交還我國，（二）原租地內公共事業，交中國政府管理。（三）住牯領英僑，得設咨詢委員會，以供中國咨詢，但我國對諮詢的事，有最後決定權，此次收回租地，共有四處：（一）長行，（二）醫生窪，（三）草地坡，（四）大連沖，均為牯嶺的勝地。</p>
<p>牯嶺之有英租地，也許國人已不大注意。故今番的交涉收回，恐不能引起我們的興奮。但這却是我國外交努力的成績。凡一個獨立國家，對於自己所有的領土，即最小的一寸，亦須有其自主權。故牯嶺英租地的收回，不能不認為是一件值得慶幸的事。</p>
<p>然收回牯嶺英租地，還有更大的意義。就是使各國明白，我國對於收回租界，實具有極切的決心。牯嶺英租地的交涉收回，不過是我國外交工作的第一步。以後我們希望各地的租界，亦能繼續收回。這正是我國應有的權利。</p>
<p>或者有人說，收回牯嶺的租地易，收回別處的租地便難，蓋英國之肯交還牯嶺租地，是因為牯嶺租地不大重要，只能供避暑之用。若上海公共租界，為英人遠東經濟的中心點，要他們放棄，那就不很容易。這話的確不錯。但這次英國的交還牯嶺租地，雖因牯嶺租地不重要，故肯放棄。然這亦算是友邦的一種好意。今後倘我國政府當局，能於相當時機，再下一番的努力，則收回各地租界，亦非絕對不可能的事。</p>
<h3 id="c193">唐家灣的海濱 <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— 艾荼</p>
<p>也帶着懷慕的心情，也帶着愉快的氣息，我又跨上了汽車，迅速地到那很有名的唐家灣去流浪，當汽車迅速地向着東南奔駛着低時候，飛覺得自己的身子穿過高的山，還有瞧不完的美麗的鄉村的風景，可惜車行得很快，只是「跑馬看花」似的溜過去了。不久，我們便可以在車廂裏望出東南方的海面。那兒就是唐家灣的海面。給晚上的太陽照耀着照射着那麼廣闊的海面，一個弧形的大海灣，遼遠的展開着，輕輕地飄盪着的白色的波濤，反映着黃金色的太陽光。變成了一張美麗的彩色，把海面的一切罩籠着。疏遠地有着幾隻小小的兵艦，許多商船泊在海的中央。</p>
<p>汽車帶着我們奔駛到海濱的時候，我們可以吸着新鮮的海風，聽到浪波衝激着嚴石的輕聲，沙沙地，拋出來的白色的浪花，向天空中飛散開去了。</p>
<p>到了唐家灣，中山縣政府的地方，本來，飛總是幻想着這兒是很偉大的，建築上跟商業上都是不錯的，然而，這兒簡直是空空的，一個殘舊的小城市，商業的冷淡是那麼可憐的，遠不及石岐的十分之一，一切所給我們的是可怕的，頹廢而已，尤其是近年來的政治上的轉動的影響，到處蘊藏着不幸的種子。</p>
<p>在馬路上和小街道上，我們看不到有什麼特異的好的建築物，路上有時會凸凹得很難跑的。一切的影子都是蕭條與慘淡。這一切的不禁地令我失望起來了。</p>
<p>獨個兒在海濱流浪着，在山麓躑躅着，心情是那麼倥惚的——我帶上了許多凄涼的影子，跟着黃昏的一切在移動。不錯，我總是受在這樣的旅途上流浪的時候就做出了許多許多的夢想。當我定着眼珠子瞪着廣闊的海面泊着的小兵艦的時候我就好像看見那兒快要爆發了可怕底戰爭。是的，這兒是一個很好的縣分，總不知有多少人們在把人民做可犧牲品，盡端的欺騙與剝掠，可怕的呀！平靜的鄉村裏早已捲起了噬人的影子，也怪不得這兒的一切是多麼蕭條與冷淡。</p>
<p>黃昏的色彩已漸漸的變得黝黑而可怕的了。</p>
<p>那廣闊的海灣面也罩上了恐怖的大布幕了，然而，一切都還是靜寂的，市場上沒有什麼吵鬧的聲音，沒有大都市的氣息，漸漸兒向着死的圈子裏埋葬去，人們也漸漸兒到睡鄉去了。</p>
<p>但是，我還是孤獨地在海濱流浪着，吸着海風，企圖在這沉靜的海濱探求出一點兒足以安慰的景物，但是，一切都是隱在黑夜之神裏，到處張着可怕的爪牙似的，黑的影子在盪動。海所給予我的解答只是浪花拋激的聲音，透出來一定的音調。以外，一切都是聽不到的。</p>
<p>帶着倦意回到市場的寓所的時候，許多人都是沉靜了，只是街頭上的淡黃的燈光還是凄涼地閃着。實在，一到夜裏，唐家灣的一切都已向死的圈子裏埋葬了。</p>
<h3 id="c194">火車路旁 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 芳沁</p>
<p>當迷糊脹重的腦袋，抬向浩渺無際的碧空，凝對着萬千里的飄飄冉冉的白雲，我或一彷彿吃驚的問起自己來：「我每天是怎樣過活的呢」？像有點醒悟，悵悵苦失。可是，過一會，心情又不知沉落到那兒去，俯下酸重的頭。</p>
<p>最近搬了十次家不止，連自己都不知是怎麼回事，只知老是不安，像隻找不着可安的巢穴的鳥似的。一隻床，一隻小臺子，一件呷咇，一張椅子，搬來搬去，只見損壞，人也只見消瘦下去。好像我家成一個不知如何活下去的小孩般。</p>
<p>這次又移到這個鄉村的江灣來，在火熱的洪流中，逃脫了蒸籠似的小亭子間，到這兒領略到一些似乎是沒有主人的涼風，我開始的放鬆了幾口氣，有時在黃昏時候，坐在門前迎着拂拂的風，也有點感到生命的些微的甦醒。然而，一剎那的甦醒早就消逝得乾淨，又竟覺很久和涼風隔絕；雖然，涼風是朝朝暮暮，飄着開闊的人們那輕鬆的絲綢的衣袖，飄着搖曳自如的樹葉。却吹不掉我沉脹迫熱而麻木的胸腦的無盡的鬱積！</p>
<p>有時，偶爾暼見前面錄草青簇如茵，林蔭幽謐的去處，有女郎，有少年人在作閒逸的，恣情的，愉快的散步，悠談，低歌，作美曠的遐思，自如輕飄的徘徊，會不覺猛的暗忖：我為什麼要老是莫名其妙的過着悶鬱的生活？我也可以和他們一樣地過去消磨日子，和他們一樣的愉快。然而，這念頭一到又消失了，我仍然是悶鬱的我。即使我想要去，也不知怎樣從來去不成一次。而為我所羨慕的公園，我常夢想能每天沉醉在那涼快幽曠的綠林下，至少對我的傷殘的身心會有點好處，誰知，省下一塊錢買了張入園券後，而我却未曾進去。</p>
<p>這，我不只不清楚為什麼？而且，我一想起這，便會增加鬱迫！</p>
<p>我的生命，就永遠像一場惡夢麼？</p>
<p>我的屋子面前，是兩條鐵軌蜿蜒的伸展着。我寂寞的，孤獨的，痛苦的生活在這火車路旁，我開始，總是茫然的，沉默的對着牠。而不時從鐵軌上輾過的火車的疾鳴銳呼，又使我十分厭惡，憤怒，牠的尖銳的呼聲剌動着我的腦筋，使我更不安。</p>
<p>但有一次，我憤怒的目光送着火車風馳雷嗚的奔向前時，那雄迸的，疾駛的，猛壯的，前進的姿勢，使我驚醒過來，驚喜的贊嘆着，泛上那飄湧的。滔滔將追上去的心流。我已逝的心泉，又重新在奔流了；我的生命頓覺甦醒！我陷在清楚的追思中。我發覺：只有這一刻，我才真正的清醒着！這，才是能夠使我不麻木的時候！</p>
<p>於是，經常那刺動人的火車的奔駛疾鳴，不復使我壓恨。每從黑暗的中夜，殘酷的惡夢中，使我驚醒起來！使我常翻起身來，開門而出，我目送着疾馳的前奔的火車，在火車的馳駛過的靜夜下，我感到週遭壯美幽曠的夜色的使我愉快。夜的涼風，也竟才吹遍渾身，使我更加清醒。靜靜的立着，我沉定而興奮，才更感到一些生命的充實，我才正發覺了自己的存在！</p>

<p>— 新野</p>
<p>「嗯！我們的船是靠在城外水泥廠碼頭的，那兒離開城市大約有十幾里路，這邊都是鄉下塲合，有什麼可打尖的地方到不知道。」船主這樣回答我。</p>
<p>太陽落了山，船雖然依舊在這蒼茫的煙波裏前進，可是我這顆心裏，恰如塡了一千塊重鉛般的沉重了。</p>
<p>當船抵埠頭的時候，一彎下弦月已靜靜地躲在頭頂，吐着嫵媚的柔光了。我跳上了岸，向船上人喊着「再會，」可是心裏卻委實有些兒老大的躊躇，沒有法子想，只好依了船主人指示給我的——東面那條大路上走去，好在這晚月光十分皎潔，所以方向路道倒還可以辨識。</p>
<p>拖着了個寂寞的影子，似幽靈般的在這黑暗的路上走着，心裏總不免有些兒惴惴的害怕，村犬是在狺狺的咆哮着，心裏眞是灼得沒有辦法了！</p>
<p>「倒不如打聽着了許屯，到表姑母家裏去借宿一宵再作道理吧，反正地生路不熟，夜行是不便當。」我情急智生，就想起了這裏還有一位被遺忘了的表姑母，於是就計劃着到那兒去借一宿。</p>
<p>這樣，在路邊敲了一家門，問明了許屯的所在！</p>
<p>許屯是這樣一個荒漠孤獨的村落，前後左右并不和別一個會莊相聯的。我一連問了幾家門，問了許多個信，道了無數個對不住，才問到了表姑母的家。</p>
<p>那位表姑母是一個孤獨的老太婆，姑丈是早已去世了，表兄弟是沒有的，不過她的手中倒還積蓄得幾個錢，所以能夠安然地度她這寂寞的晚年！她見了她三年不見的表姪，是怎樣的瞇着一對老花的眼睛在歡迎着呵！</p>
<p>這一夜，我睡在床上，卻翻來覆去的不能入夢，儘望着那個窗洞裏射進來的一縷月光發楞；怔怔地向四壁看着，房間裏是空空洞洞的不覺有些駭懼起來。</p>
<p>後來終於因為疲倦不過了，所以不知在什麼時候睡了去，等到一覺醒來，已見太陽溜進了房裏。那時表姑母正笑嘻嘻的站在房門口：</p>
<p>「姪少爺早啦！再睡一回吧！」</p>
<p>但是要干自家的事情，太辜負了她的殷勤底招待了。（完）</p>

<p>— 魯荪</p>
<p>明瓦窗上剛顯出肚白色，阿翠一骨碌從破絮中爬起來。可是在這湫溢的臥室內，還是像地獄一般地黑暗：明瓦窗上的光明僅能照見幾寸以內的地方，於是阿翠睜大了眼睛，彷彿一隻野貓一樣，想搜尋到她的目的物。她躡手躡腳下了床，在一隻三腳凳上她摸到了一襲輕軟的衣服，她底手指的觸覺就告訴她是她日夜所盼望着的花樣布罩衫了。</p>
<p>昏暗似乎放了光明，她很快地穿到了身上，就着明瓦窗上透進來的光綫，她向壁上狹小的鏡子裏想看一看自家的影子。雖然并不如她理想的映着一個如花如玉的美人兒，在那荳腐干大的鏡框中，她僅能糢糊地照見花花點點的斑文，就這樣，她已感覺到那花斑紋所名裹着的身體，是怎樣美的的一個新生底人物了。</p>
<p>於是她笑了起來，那樣情不自禁地，可是驚醒了在睡夢中的她的爹媽。</p>
<p>臥室內已經漸漸地明亮了，阿翠的爹媽看見他們的女兒披上那襲新罩衫的姿態，在兩顆衰老的胸中又勾起了昨天的事情，那樣一個年輕的女兒，然毫無理由地送給周鄉董嗎？但是想到櫐年的欠租，那年老的爸爸是無可奈何地流淚了。就是這一層理由，欠了周鄉董的租，就不能估計自家女兒的終身幸福了。</p>
<p>昨天阿翠的爸被地保從早上喚了去，到太陽落山才歸家，他那個樣子彷彿做了一天的苦工似的，走路都不能支持。一進門，一條懶牛樣的橫到床上，誰的問話都不理會，好像問話人都是他的冤家，他用血紅的眼睛注視着母女倆。女兒已經哭起來了，在她弱小的心中他以為爸害了重病，因為爸從前沒有那個樣子的。</p>
<p>年老的母親已經知道是怎樣回事了：地保先不是個好東西，祇要他踅上門來，就該誰家倒霉，阿翠的爸被喚整天日子，不會有好事情的。但是那個不好的事情卻落到她女兒身上，是她所想不到的。</p>
<p>事情就那樣地：張着血紅眼睛的爸爸說出地保的限期來時，母親是沒有方法再不掛下的她的眼淚了。她蹦着蹄子樣的小腳，罵着，罵周鄉董那吃人不見血的傢伙；罵地保那個狗頭，逢時逢節大魚大肉孝敬了他，卻落得帮着那魔王來打算自家的女兒。於是她彷彿她的女兒就要被奪去了，把她抱到自己懷抱裏。但是女兒一點都不知道他們鬧着什麼把戲，媽媽是時常哭的，當然又是什麼人逼着她要錢。她用着謹慎的目光向這簡簡陋的臥室打了一轉時，她知道值錢的東西都被人家拿去了，於是她的目光落到那襲新洋布罩衫上，那是今天爸爸來不及拿去當的，因為那個狗頭逼着爸爸走了。她就天真地告訴媽，把牠去抵了人家的債吧，她是可以餓幾天不吃東西的。</p>
<p>「這有什麼用！」母親罵了起來，但是她馬上明白過來，女兒是懂得家裏已經沒有一個錢，她以為這樣一襲罩衫可以償還爸爸的欠債，她把女兒摟得更緊一點，含着淚輕輕地說：「這襲罩衫是不能給人家的，你穿了明天爸爸帶你進城去。」</p>
<p>老頭子還是紅着眼睛，那襲花紋的新罩衫在他眼前彷彿是隻噬人的豹，牠就要把他的女兒攫去了。但是有什麼法想呢，他欠了人家的錢。</p>

<p>「傻大姐，你究竟傻不傻」？</p>
<p>一般人看見了有着傻大姐渾號的倉隱秋，肚子裏就會生了這個疑問，相當面問一問倉隱秋但話就是到了喉頭，也會咽下去，從來沒有一個人敢這樣的對倉隱秋問，誠恐她反臉不認人，倒討了一個沒趣，於是，倉隱秋究竟傻不傻，畢竟還是成了一個疑問，因為在本人自己沒有公開承認以前，是不能夠成立的。</p>
<p>倉隱秋之所以有傻大姐的渾號，不明白底細的人，似乎是侮辱了倉女士，是公然的誹謗，其實這卻是在大讚倉女士，因為倉女士在「人間仙子」裏的傻性表演獲得了極可貴的成功，才有這渾號的。倉女士也明白的對於「傻大姐」的賜予始終不拒絕，可是也不見她承認，或者也是她「自謙」吧？</p>
<p>就因為倉女士不肯明白的對這「傻大姐」渾號表示接受與否，所以人們都想當面問一問倉女士：「傻大姐，你究竟傻不傻」？可是人們又怯弱的不敢問。</p>
<p>袁叢美畢竟是很聰明的，他看準了人們的心理，特的在他導演的有聲片「暴風雨」片中，呌倉女士親自回答人們對她，你是不是「傻大姐」的疑問，　　你要求倉女士回答你素來的疑問，只需在「暴風雨」聲片公映的時候去看就可明白了。</p>

<h3 id="c206">汽車界一大革新後引擎車試騐成功 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 虞</p>
<p>目下我們所習常見的汽車。共引擊都是裝在前部的。由機力的推動。把全車曳著向前進行。車中最重耍的一部份。裝置在前頭。如果車頭因駕駛不愼。而撞別的東西時。引擊部份一壞。全車就陷於停頓。不能再行前進了。近幾年來。汽車製造家。別出心裁。研究把引擎移到後面去。自從經過幾番的實地試騐和改革之後。這種所謂後引擎車。居然大告成功。它的種種優點。像平穩省費等。聽之令人神往。不可謂非汽車製造上的一大革新。下面所紀的。便是美國的第一輛後引擎汽車「斯如拉勃」號的駛車情形。和這後引擊車試騐成功的鐵證。</p>
<p>這一輛被稱為「他日的汽車」後引擎車「斯加拉勃」號。在四個月之前。由發明人威廢姆史討脫氏紹介於汽車界中的。現在由於它的表演成績。已證它是絕對的成功了。這輛後引擎車本來是沒有人知道。而默默無名的。直到今年二月裏。由它－手創造的主人史討脫出面紹介。和汽車界中人行相見禮。方絻被人注意。自從那時候初次漏臉之後。這輛「斯加拉勃」。由它的主人每日鞭策着。聘駛道上。沐風櫛雨。不知不覺已經有四個多月了。在這一百二十多天的光陰裏。它所走過的路。倒也看實叮觀。據它主人計算。長途跋涉。已经旅行過二二。〇〇〇英里。在這兩萬兩千英里的長途奔波中。所經過的道路。好的壞的。各式各等都有。而且各處各地的天氣、環境儘各不同。真所謂到一個去處。有一個滋味。平均每天所走的路程。總得在五百英里左右。每小時的速率快時六十英里。遲時五十五英里。統扯起來。在每天五百多英里的計程中。每點鐘的速率在五六＋英里上下。誰也不能說是走得像蝸牛爬墻頭的了。</p>
<p>在這個初步試騐中。據「斯加拉勃」的發明人史討脫說。所用的油眞是再省不過。全部消耗的油量不過二十夸爾。而平均每一加侖的汽油倒好走十八英里。史討脫因為這第一砲開得很響。試騐成功。雄心勃發。打算在今年年內先造成一百輛。以後再陸續造賣。據六月初底屈立屋消息。「斯如拉勃」的兄身老二。在七月裹就可以呱呱墮地的了。並聞一待裝置完畢。也要像它的令兄一樣。在各種道路上去澈底試騐一番哩。車中的塞車部份。是用水力制動的。</p>
<p>史討脫的第一次試給途程。是由底屈立屋出發到佛洛立達為止。再由終點回到出發點。在這一段行程中。「斯加拉勃」引擊中所需冷卻用的水不過一奈爾。第二次行程仍從底屈立屋出發。經過樂士安極立斯倒西亞　。再由西亞圖回轉到康出發她——底立屋。這一史討脫和他的同俘。真設味見。他們白夫坐在以廂耳，好像督通想秉的汽車，一股。到了晚上。。卻肥後韋座可以拆卸移動的達褥搬動。做成一個床舖模樣。便大冢安臥共上。他們在車子裏。不但吃飯。飯後還要喝暍咖啡。消遺消遣。這時方块裏的咖徘杯。裹面的流汁。一點也不撥開到外面釆。</p>
<p>「斯加拉勃」經過西部諸州時。風勢視是緊大。可是借着車身準流綫化型的光。到也一些不覺得難受。經過甘薩斯城的時侯。正碰着塵埃飛揚的旋風。灰抄揚空。瞇目不見景物。只才行不得也哥哥。暗暗叫苦。他們一行被塵浪軟禁在旅館裹。一步也移動不得。直到室中塵埃略為減輕了些。三間門面外勉強可以看清來西時。纔把車機中的油上了些。窗子和通風機。都緊閉起排。以防塵浪的侵襲。據史討服事後對人說「車子裏面的灰塵卻較旅館屋子裹為少」。不也是耐人尋味麼。</p>
<p>後引擎車因為引奪裝在被面的綠故。機力從後面出來。上山極為容易。而不費力。更因為機車身的銳改。從任何角度瞭望都便易。在這次試騐行程中間。機身中的廢氣排洩。和樹器中所發生的熱力都覺減少。這一點據史討脫說。是要歸功於後引擎裝置的緣故哩。</p>
<p>有人說汽車大王亨利福特。對於這種後引擎的「斯加拉勃」車也著實的關切而感覺興味。史討脫說「那是一些的關係也沒有的。雖然有時侯我是在想着最好有的「。「斯加拉勃」的全體好像一個甲蟲。全用管形精鋼銀接而成的。據史討脫說。此了普爾門車身。還要強固哩</p>
<p>車廂裏的通風系裝置。是直流式的。從車前到車後。都能暢直的流通著。機身是全部有隔熱装置的。就是車窗也裝著特別的隔熱玻璃。據史討脫估計。今後的三年中。所有的美國汽車廠都要製造這種後引擊車哩。</p>
<h3 id="c207">关於汽车引擎的幾個簡單算式 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>

<p>一　汽缸容積（Pistoaclsuiement)</p>
<p>所謂汽缸容積。亦稱排氣量。便是指活塞當每一衝程滑動所經過空間的容積而言。此地所說的衝程是指活塞由內向外。或由外向內所經過的距離而言。也可說是當曲臂從上死點至下死點。或從下死點至上死點時活塞所經過的距離而言。假使我們已經知道汽缸的內口徑與衝程。則汽缸容積不難算出。當我們要表示某引擊的大小時。當將汽缸口徑與衝程等字樣省去不序。僅就寫二個數目字就行了。譬如像　。四瓦表汽缸口徑。五卽代表衝程。如此。　引擊。意思卽是一部有着四英寸口徑和五英寸衝稈的引擊。</p>
<p>一部引擊的汽紅容積卽等於一只汽缸的容積兼該引擎的汽缸數目。可以下式表明之：</p>
<p>在美國。汽車按照馬力的大小而等級。此種馬力。是由註是由註冊製造汽車業公會（Asociation　of　Licensd　Automobilo　Manofacturers)和汽車工程學會（Society　of　Automtrve）定的公式而算出的啼而這個公式算鵲的馬力。並不是任何情形之下都正確的馬力。也不是理論上正確的動力。不過藉此於不同的引擎間互相有個比較而已，</p>
<p>這個公式是從計算蒸氣機馬力的公式脱化而出的。計算蒸氣機馬力的公式</p>
<p>這個公式是專爭一汽缸的滌氣機應用的。而活塞的每－衝程都是工作所程。為使此公式能適應計算四行程汽車引澤起見。須以引擎的汽缸數目乘之。再者。四行程引擎中工作衝程只有一個。則尚須以四除之。這樣。計算四行程引擎的馬力的公式卽如下：</p>
<p>為應用這個公式至汽車引擎起見。會經很定活塞速度　）平均足每分鐘－千英尺。平均壓力（即　是每方英寸而十磅。機械效率是百分之七十五。將這些數值墊入以上所設的公式後卽如下：</p>
<p>現代的引擎。活塞速度要超過每分鐘一千尺多多。如果我們將實在的活塞速度與假定的活塞速度求一比率。再以此此率和從上面公式所算出的馬力乘。如此所得的結果。可與實際上所發田的動力相差不遠了。為說明這層起見。假定仍以前面所舉例酌的擎眾講。活塞衝程是五英寸半。曲軸每六鐘轉二千四百迴轉。活塞速度是等於每二迥轉活塞所猾動的英尺數與每分錄的週轉數相乘卽得。在這個問題內活塞於每一衝程滑動五英寸半。曲軸一迥轉卽滑動士一英寸。則在二千四百轉的引學毬度下活塞將每分鐘滑動</p>
<p>這個馬力數統和實際上引擊所產生的動力很近了。</p>
<p>現在將汽車工程學會所規定的指示馬力。立一表如後。以便參考。</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Central Committee member Ye Chu Cang arrived in Beijing from Jinan at 7 PM on the 13th. It is scheduled that on the 14th, he will report at the Central Political Council the details of his meeting with President Wang to persuade him to stay. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ye Chu Cang arrived at Pukou by train from Qingdao at 7 PM on the 13th. Wei Huai went to Pukou, and Chu Minyi went to Xiaguan to welcome him. After crossing the river, Ye returned to his private residence to rest. That evening, he met with Ju Zheng, Kong Xiangxi, and various central authorities to report on his trip to Qingdao to comfort Wang. He will also attend and report at the Central Political Council on the 14th. According to what Ye told reporters about the President's recent condition, Wang's spirits are excellent, and his feelings towards the central comrades are also extremely harmonious and deep. Regardless of whether he resumes the position of President of the Executive Yuan, he is determined not to abandon positions within the central government. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>Executive Yuan Retains Ministers Who Resigned</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After President Wang resigned, Minister of Industries Chen Gongbo, Minister of Railways Gu Mengyu, Minister of Education Wang Shijie, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Chen Shuren, and Director of the Political Affairs Department of the Executive Yuan Peng Xuepei, in order to show their solidarity with Wang, successively submitted their resignations to the Executive Yuan. During the Executive Yuan meeting on the morning of the 13th, Acting President Kong presented a report, and after discussion, it was resolved that all be retained. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Minister of Industries Chen Gongbo has not been to his office since the 13th after submitting his resignation. According to Secretary Luo of the ministry, Minister Chen did not attend the Executive Yuan meeting on the morning of the 13th, nor did he go to his office after submitting his resignation. However, before the Executive Yuan approves it, he will naturally maintain the status quo, so the ministry's administrative affairs are proceeding as usual and have not been suspended at all. Also, an official from the Ministry of Railways said that Minister Gu's resignation has been sent out, stating that due to illness, he is unable to bear the heavy responsibility. The wording is simple, and the ministry's administrative affairs are still being presided over by Vice Minister Lu, and have not been suspended. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Gu Mengyu submitted his resignation to the central government, he is still in the Western Hills. According to those around him, after submitting his resignation, Gu is currently determined to recuperate in the Western Hills and does not plan to go elsewhere for the time being. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Shijie expressed solidarity with the President and submitted his resignation at the Executive Yuan's routine meeting on the morning of the 13th. It was resolved to retain him. Wang went to his office in the afternoon and worked as usual. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>Chairman Lin Sends Wei Huai to Console Wang</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After Chairman Lin consoled President Wang with a telegram, Wang's intention to resign has not been dispelled. On the 13th, he specially telegraphed Wei Huai from Guling, instructing him to represent him in Qingdao and earnestly persuade Wang to stay. Wei took a train to Qingdao on the evening of the 13th. After personally conveying Chairman Lin's earnest intentions to Wang, he will return to Nanjing. Chairman Lin is also determined to return to Nanjing at the beginning of next month. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Lin telegraphed Wei Huai, Chief of Civil Service of the National Government, on the 13th, to represent him in Qingdao to persuade President Wang to stay. Wei took a train to Jinan on the night of the 13th and transferred to Qingdao. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>To Be Discussed at Today's Political Council Meeting</p>
<p>(Nanjing) President Wang insists on resigning due to his need for radical treatment of his illness. Although various parties have tried to persuade him to stay, it is said that some members of the central government believe that Wang presides over the central government affairs with important responsibility and cannot be allowed to step down. They mostly advocate earnestly persuading him to stay and continue to take responsibility. However, considering Wang's health, he may be allowed to relinquish his concurrent position as Minister of Foreign Affairs and serve only as President of the Executive Yuan. It is expected that the Central Political Council will discuss this matter on the 14th, and a corresponding decision may be made. Furthermore, the heads of various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan who have submitted resignations include Chen Shuren, Chen Gongbo, Gu Mengyu, Wang Shijie, Chu Minyi, and Peng Xuepei. A report has been submitted at the Executive Yuan's routine meeting on the 13th, and a unanimous resolution was passed to retain them. When this case was presented, Kong Xiangxi expressed that the central government is still trying to persuade Wang to stay, and that the heads of the Executive Yuan need not submit resignations, etc. However, it is still difficult to know whether the ministers will withdraw their resignations. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Gongbo and Chen Shuren did not attend the Executive Yuan's routine meeting on the 13th because they had already submitted their resignations. The Executive Yuan is preparing to handle the handover. Wang Shijie, Chu Minyi, and Peng Xuepei have also submitted resignations. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>Wang Expresses Extremely Firm Determination to Leave</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After President Wang resigned, various parties sent telegrams of condolence and persuasion. However, Wang's determination to leave is extremely firm. He telegraphed a certain important person in Nanjing yesterday, stating that once the central government approves his resignation from the positions of President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Foreign Affairs, he will return to Nanjing immediately and serve in the central party headquarters in the capacity of a Central Committee member to jointly promote national affairs. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>Executive Yuan Prepares to Handle Handover</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Shuren and Chen Gongbo did not attend the Executive Yuan's routine meeting on the 13th after resigning, nor did they go to their offices. The Executive Yuan is preparing to handle the handover. Although the general public believes that President Wang's intention to resign is firm, the final decision must await the central government's resolution to determine the direction of the political situation. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>Kong Xiangxi Discusses Wang's Resignation</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Kong Xiangxi told reporters at noon on the 13th that after President Wang resigned, he had been in frequent telegraphic communication with him. Wang's intention to resign is still firm. Chairman Lin and Chairman Jiang have both sent telegrams to persuade him to stay. The central government plans to present this matter for discussion at the Central Political Council meeting on the 14th and unanimously persuade him to stay. He is acting as President of the Executive Yuan and hopes that President Wang can return to Nanjing to preside over the affairs as soon as possible so that he can be relieved of his duties. According to his opinion, at a time when the country is facing many difficulties, it is necessary to gather all forces and jointly plan for the country, and not to talk about resigning. If President Wang is suffering from illness and the government affairs are too complicated, the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs, which was assumed due to the resignation of Minister Luo, does not necessarily need to be completely relinquished in fact. Kong continued that the disaster relief funds for various provinces have already been allocated and decided. However, due to the severity of the disaster, the central government should raise additional funds for the requests of various provinces. However, local authorities should also work together to find solutions. Furthermore, it is hoped that social charity organizations and enthusiastic individuals will jointly help to provide disaster relief to the victims so that everyone can easily lift it together. Currently, Shanghai is making every effort to initiate fundraising, and it is hoped that the whole country can rise up together and enthusiastically donate. He is going to inspect the Yangtze River to comfort the people affected by the disaster and to decide on future prevention strategies. After returning from the inspection, he will depart to inspect the provinces of Hebei, Henan, and Shandong. The rumor that the Lottery Savings Association will be taken over by the Central Trust Bureau and that public bonds will be issued to recover the four-shore tickets is not true. As for the case of Tao Shangming being detained, after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs protested to Japan, there has been no response yet. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>Central Government Urges Sun and Yu to Return to Nanjing</p>
<p>(Nanjing) As the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee is approaching and central government affairs are complicated, in addition to making every effort to retain Wang, the central government also telegraphed Sun Ke in Qingdao and Yu Youren in Shanghai, urging them to return to Nanjing ahead of schedule. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>British Newspaper's View on Wang's Resignation</p>
<p>(London) Today, various newspapers here have carried news of the resignation of Wang Jingwei and other officials, as well as the assassination of the Director of the Japanese Military Affairs Bureau, Nagata, yesterday. The Manchester Guardian reported that Chinese bonds had been firming up when Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, the British government's economic advisor, set off for China. Today, upon receiving news of Wang Jingwei's resignation, the price softened slightly. However, the general opinion is that this is merely a prudent preventive measure by speculators. Merchants here who are concerned about Chinese affairs regret Wang Jingwei's resignation, as they see Wang as a balancing force between the civil and military factions in the government and as a capable diplomat. Since the Nanjing government took power, it has encountered many storms, but it has been able to pass through them safely. It does not appear that any political turmoil will occur when Sir Frederick Leith-Ross arrives in China. (Reuters dispatch on the 13th)</p>

<p>(Xuzhou) According to a phone call from Lanjia Dam, the Wei River has risen sharply again by 7 Chinese inches, reaching the root of the West Dyke, with a depth of about one Chinese foot. The water flowing from the mouth into the Jing River is also rapid. Shao Hanyuan, accompanied by Wang Gongyu, Zhao Yuxin, Dai Ziqiang, and others, went to inspect the Jing River and the lower reaches of the Bulao River this morning. According to Li Yizhi's plan, they are planning to build a southern dike along the river to prevent flooding and increase the flow. People from Peixian said that Shandong Province plans to build eastern dykes for the southern Shandong lakes to prevent eastward flooding, so that the water can be discharged into the Grand Canal. Currently, troops are stationed in areas north of Xiazhen in Shandong, such as Yangzha West Bay, and dike construction is underway. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Ke Yuyu, a section chief stationed in Peixian of the Special Commissioner's Office, returned to Xuzhou and said that he had received a report in Peixian that a total of seven dams on the border of western Shandong and Jiangsu had been breached in two places. The flood flows rapidly to the south, and the eastern part of Yutai is virtually submerged. The western dike of the Weishan Lake in the Fengpei area can still provide some protection at a considerable water level, but if the water level exceeds the limit, it will be extremely dangerous. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) According to a telegram from Peixian, the newly breached Yellow River water is rapidly pouring into Weishan Lake from western Shandong. The water level in Sanlimiao Lake in the sixth district of northern Peixian has suddenly risen, with a rapid flow, reaching directly to the north dike, with a depth of one meter. The water level in the rivers of Gaozhuang, Caozhuang, and Anzhuang has also risen rapidly by one meter. In addition to supervising the workers to defend and block the dikes, Peixian County Chief Su Min telegraphed the Provincial Government, the Department of Civil Affairs, the Department of Construction, the Special Commissioner's Office, and the Jiangbei Flood Control Office for emergency assistance. Zhang Ruochen, the president of the Peixian Chamber of Commerce, and Wang Shizhi, the director of funds and property, came to Xuzhou today to purchase 5,000 hemp bags for use in Peixian. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) According to the Jiangbei Canal Area Flood Control Office, the water level of Weishan Lake increased by 31 centimeters on the 12th, with an actual height of 34.255 meters. The water flow goes directly to the canal. On the same day, the water level of the Hanzhuang Canal had increased from 33.897 to 34.207 meters, not far from the water level of the great flood of the 20th year of the Republic (1931). Li Yizhi, chairman of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Committee, originally planned to travel from Hai to Xuzhou today and then go to Hanzhuang to inspect the water level of the Weishan Lake canal mouth. Instead, he went to Suqian to guide the construction of the water diversion dam project at Liu Lao Jian and inspect the water level of the Shizi River. In the afternoon, he traveled north along the canal and then went to Yaowan to inspect. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) More than 40 yards of the slope of the Wangtan Great Dyke below the Dongzhuang mouth have collapsed. The water depth at the base of the dike is one or two yards. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han Fuju sent Sun Zirang to Bian (Kaifeng) to negotiate the construction of the light railway and the breach of the Yellow River. Sun telegraphed that the light railway from Lanfeng to Dongzhuang would be repaired by the Yellow River Conservancy Commission. The railway tracks were insufficient, so Kong Xiangrong raised a part, and the rest and the material cars were requisitioned in Shandong. A transportation office was also set up in Lanfeng. The Ministry of Railways has agreed to allocate two trains to transport materials. Kong Xiangrong first raised one train. The Dike Closure Committee held a meeting today and decided: (1) Telegraph Kong Xiangrong to inquire about the number of railway tracks and material cars needed so that they can be requisitioned; (2) Telegraph Liu Zhi to inform him that a transportation office has been set up in Lanfeng and to send a battalion of soldiers to load and unload; (3) Telegraph Kong Xiangrong and the Ministry of Railways to quickly allocate three trains for use and telegraph Sun Zirang to hire boats nearby; (4) The dike closure meeting will be held in Dongzhuang on the 18th. Han and the committee members will take an armored train to Lanfeng on the evening of the 16th and transfer to Dongzhuang for the meeting. Sun Zirang telegraphed from Dongzhuang today that the situation at the mouth has deteriorated due to this major flood. The five, six, and seven embankments of the Jiangsu Dam have been completely washed away, collapsing more than eight yards, causing the main flow to flow eastward more smoothly, directly impacting the sixth mouth. The east end of the dike has collapsed to the point where it connects with the people's embankment of the great dike. The water has now receded, and the danger seems to have passed. Reports of another breach are false. However, the dike closure project must be re-measured and planned. Due to the impact of the main flow on the 10th and 11th, the Zhukou Great Dyke is still not out of danger. Due to the changes in the mouth and the continuous heavy rain, dike closure cannot be carried out. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Xu Shiying, accompanied by Secretary Hu Mai and others, took a train north on the evening of the 13th to inspect the floods in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan. It is said that there are currently tens of millions of disaster victims in the three provinces. In addition to conveying the central government's condolences to the refugees, this trip will also conduct an on-the-spot investigation of the disaster situation, as well as investigate the local governments' on-site disaster relief efforts, discuss practical relief measures, and urge the provinces to implement the Disaster Relief Reserve Fund Act.

<h3 id="e9">The Effectiveness of American Silver Nationalization Over the Past Year <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>— End</p>
<p>It has been over a year since the United States nationalized silver. The effectiveness has not been thoroughly reviewed, but generally speaking, although the price of silver has reached $0.6775, the profits of silver mining companies may not have increased much. On the contrary, due to the U.S. government's excessive collection of silver profit taxes, the large silver market has been taken over by London and Montevideo. As a result, American silver merchants have lost a large amount of commissions. In the agricultural sector, the assistance from agricultural product exports has also been very limited. Even with the loan relationships for cotton and wheat exports to China, the amount is not large. Therefore, only industrial activity within the country has seen some progress, while agriculture remains sluggish. As for the desire to raise the price of silver and promote the purchasing power of silver-using countries, only Mexico may benefit as a silver-producing country. However, China may suffer from a deepened economic panic. It has been said that the U.S. silver purchase policy has repeatedly failed, creating opportunities for silver speculators and increasing unstable factors in the world market, which is indeed true.</p>
<p>If the U.S. silver purchase could fulfill the hopes of the silver faction members and reach a gold-silver ratio of 3:1, with the price of silver reaching over one dollar, what would happen to the price of silver afterward? If it is allowed to fluctuate, then the current increase is superfluous. If the world is forced to use a bimetallic standard, can it fulfill all of the U.S.'s wishes? If its price is continued to be maintained, then the effort may eventually be exhausted. Although prices can be manipulated by human power, it can only be done temporarily and cannot resist the greatness of natural forces, so it cannot be permanently unchanged. Therefore, unless various countries of the world have an automatic need for silver, no matter how great the power of the U.S. silver faction members is, it will ultimately be difficult to stabilize the price of silver. Furthermore, the biggest goal of the U.S. to raise the price of silver is China, but how has it been over the past year? Silver exports can go as smoothly as the U.S. expected. Although there is a Gentleman's Agreement, due to the great benefits, overseas silver markets often see Chinese selling. The more Chinese silver leaks out, the more turbulent China's financial market becomes, and the stagnation of foreign trade is the opposite of what the U.S. expected. Now, China's economy is almost to the point where it cannot recover, and there are many who are watching eagerly. If a coalition is formed and the market creates a situation of division, even if the U.S. deeply regrets the futility of the silver purchase policy, it will be too late.</p>
<p>If one wants to seek the practical development of Sino-American economy, it is better to seek it in the exchange of goods than in gold and silver currency. Only when one goes to the other with what one has to exchange for what one does not have can it be maintained without depletion. If one only considers one's own interests and brings goods while taking silver, even if China's silver is piled up like a mountain, it will inevitably be exhausted at some point, let alone a country with a huge trade deficit and exhausted wealth. In recent times, countries often want to apply what they have done to colonies to China, outwardly showing the sincerity of assistance while covertly establishing spheres of influence. If this policy remains unchanged for a long time, the Chinese economy will have no chance of recovery, and the fierce competition will see that governing become more and more complicated, brewing a dangerous situation. Therefore, only by eliminating private prejudices and establishing a new chain between countries and the Chinese economy under the principle of equal mutual benefit can both sides mutually benefit from it.</p>

<p>Yokohama New Commander of the China Garrison Army, Major General Tada, left Tokyo at 9 PM on the 12th to take up his post. Tada told reporters in the car that the Central Army had not given him any special mission when he left, so he would continue the policy of the previous commander after taking office. The anti-Japanese atmosphere in North China has almost disappeared, and the main objective from now on should be to develop the economy, but increasing the welfare of the Chinese and Japanese people is a necessary condition. The policy of developing the North China economy has already been decided in Japan, so after he takes office, he plans to fully investigate the actual situation on the ground and study the means and methods of implementing the policy. The incident of the Japanese and Italian soldiers being killed in Luanzhou is still under investigation on the ground. He cannot express his response policy and will implement appropriate countermeasures after clarifying the truth on the ground. (United Press dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>Yokohama The new Commander of the China Garrison Army, Major General Tada, departed from Tokyo last night at 9 PM to take up his post. On the train, he told reporters his aspirations, saying, "Before departing, I suffered from a cold and rested for several days, so I do not know the truth about the Mizhou Incident. Although the commander of the army has changed, there is no reason for the policy towards China to change, and naturally I will follow the policy of the previous commander." Although he has no special mission to contact the Commander of the Kwantung Army, he will go to Changchun to meet with him for the sake of communication. (Dentsu dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) Regarding the economic development issue in North China, the Japanese China Garrison Army, Kwantung Army, South Manchuria Railway (Mantetsu), and other parties concerned have repeatedly met in Tianjin. Under the guidance of leaders in various economic fields, a concrete plan has been decided for Japanese and "Manchukuo" capital to enter North China. According to a certain staff officer of the Kwantung Army who is in charge of this task, the main points are as follows: (1) To gather authorities from all fields in Tianjin and establish a large research institution jointly run by Japan, "Manchukuo," and China as the headquarters for economic development in North China, taking on the guiding task of its general staff; (2) The entry of Japanese capital will be mainly carried out through Mantetsu under the guidance of the Economic Staff Headquarters. Furthermore, the Japanese Army Department has also indicated to President Matsuoka that the management policy of Mantetsu should focus on creating a Japanese-Manchukuo economic bloc so that "Manchukuo" can also work together to develop the North China economy. The Central Army Department and the Kwantung Army authorities are also cooperating in discussing the issue of reorganizing Mantetsu in order to meet new needs. (Hualian dispatch on the 13th)</p>

As a result of exchanging views on future countermeasures, it was decided that Army Minister Hayashi should be asked to focus on military control at this time, which is considered absolutely necessary to be self-reliant.

The opinions among the cabinet members were consistent. (United Press dispatch on the 13th)</p>

Interior Minister Goto and Railway Minister Uchida, who were vacationing in Karuizawa, rushed back to Tokyo overnight because the incident had a major impact on the political situation. They visited Army Minister Hayashi together with Prime Minister Okada and Colonial Affairs Minister Kodama, and carefully considered countermeasures. Finance Minister Takahashi sent a secretary from Hayama to Tokyo to hear the situation. Foreign Minister Hirota, who was originally scheduled to attend the welcoming ceremony for Ambassador Matsudaira to the UK, stopped attending due to the emergency and considered methods to resolve the situation with other ministers.

<p>(Tokyo) Army Minister Lin dispatched Vice Minister Hashimoto this morning to pay respects to Prime Minister Okada, reporting on the assassination of Lieutenant General Nagata. Furthermore, Army Minister Lin intends to visit Prime Minister Okada within one or two days to reveal a major decision regarding the problems within the Control Faction. (13th Den Tsushin)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The army is making efforts to crack down on strange documents regarding the situation within the army, only now realizing the depth of the harm they cause, which is beyond expectations. Therefore, they have decided to take this opportunity to thoroughly investigate the relationships behind them and the financial connections, approaching it with a decisive attitude. That is, regarding the assassination of Director of the Military Affairs Bureau Nagata, they are also determined to thoroughly investigate and take decisive measures. (13th Den Tsushin)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The issue of Army Minister Lin's resignation is currently the center of attention. It is said that there is a strong opinion within the army that, while the importance of the Army Minister's responsibility is undeniable, resigning due to such a sudden incident would set a bad precedent for the future. Moreover, the situation within the army currently does not allow for the replacement of the Army Minister. Therefore, the priority is for the Army Minister to actively carry out the unification project before sacrificing himself. The issue of responsibility can only be considered after this problem is resolved. (13th Jiji News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Army Vice Minister Hashimoto told reporters on the evening of the 12th that the assassination of Director of the Military Affairs Bureau Nagata was an extremely regrettable incident for the entire army. At a time when the international situation is serious, the loss of a capable person is a great tragedy. The authorities are still investigating the truth and cannot yet express any opinions. However, I believe that there will be no resignation by the Army Minister due to this incident. What we are most concerned about now is how to clarify the full picture of the incident as soon as possible and resolve all issues satisfactorily. The army authorities plan to issue instructions to all army personnel regarding this incident, but the content is not being disclosed because it concerns the military. (13th Jiji News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The newly appointed Director of the Military Affairs Bureau, Lieutenant General Imai Kiyoshi, is originally from Aichi Prefecture. He graduated at the top of his class in the 15th class of the Infantry Department of the Army Military Academy. He then graduated from the Army War College. Afterwards, he was stationed in Germany and successively served as a member of the General Staff Headquarters, an instructor at the Army War College, the Chief of the Second Section and the Chief of the First Department of the General Staff Headquarters. He was then appointed as the Director of the Personnel Bureau in March of this year. He is a purely military system man. Therefore, he has consistently been a strategist in the General Staff Headquarters and the Army War College. As for his sudden transfer to the position of Director of the Personnel Bureau in the military administration system in March of this year, it was because Lieutenant General Imai has no factional affiliations and is strict and fair. Therefore, he was drawn in by Army Minister Lin, who prioritized the unification faction, and he displayed his skills during this regular transfer. Now that he has been appointed as the Director of the Military Affairs Bureau, the highest position in the military administration system, he will surely become the Army Vice Minister in the future, which is widely supported. It is said that Lieutenant General Imai's transfer to the Director of the Military Affairs Bureau is beneficial. (13th Den Tsushin)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The newly appointed Director of the Military Affairs Bureau, Imai Kiyoshi, initially did not belong to any party within the army. However, Army Minister Lin recognized his outstanding talent and brought him into his sphere of influence, appointing him as the Director of the Personnel Bureau. Now, because Director of the Military Affairs Bureau Nagata was killed by an assassin, the Army Minister is responsible for handling this incident and is determined to select his confidant, Imai, to succeed as Director of the Military Affairs Bureau in order to thoroughly control the department.

<p>(Tokyo) At 1:40 PM today, the Ministry of the Army announced that the perpetrator who attacked Director of the Military Affairs Bureau Lieutenant General Nagata was Army Infantry Lieutenant Colonel Saburo Aizawa. He is currently undergoing preliminary examination by the military court of the 1st Division and was detained at the Tokyo Garrison Prison at 11:54 PM on the 12th. The motive for the attack is currently unknown, but it seems to be the result of trusting erroneous rumors about Director of the Military Affairs Bureau Nagata. The Lieutenant Colonel was transferred from the 41st Infantry Regiment to the 1st Infantry Regiment in Taiwan on the 1st of this month, ordered to serve at the Gōhoku Higher Commercial School. He had completed preparations for his departure and arrived in Tokyo on the night of the 11th. (13th Den Tsushin)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Lieutenant Colonel Saburo Aizawa, who assassinated Director of the Military Affairs Bureau Nagata, was born in Sendai City and is 47 years old this year. He once served as a fencing instructor at the Army Toyama School and is a renowned master of swordsmanship with a 4th-dan rank. He is straightforward in nature, extremely sensitive, and possesses a chivalrous spirit. His disciples often call him "Takayama Hikokuro" (Translator's note: Takayama Hikokuro was one of the three eccentric retainers of the late Tokugawa shogunate, a loyalist who worried about the decline of the imperial family and advocated for reverence for the emperor). He was able to concentrate the faith and popularity of young officers. The Lieutenant Colonel suffered from otitis media and was admitted to Keio Hospital in January of last year, which then turned into meningitis, putting him in a critical condition for a time. He later recovered, but it is said that his ears are currently avoiding sound stimulation. (13th Jiji News Agency)</p>
<p>Fukuyama: A reporter visited the home of Lieutenant Colonel Saburo Aizawa, who assassinated Director of the Military Affairs Bureau Nagata, today. His wife, Yoneko, looked worried and told the reporter that her husband was usually taciturn, did not socialize with people, and never talked about his own opinions. Therefore, she does not know the cause of the incident that occurred this time. Also, the adjutant of the 41st Regiment said that Lieutenant Colonel Aizawa's swordsmanship was 4th-dan, and he was stubborn and quite provocative. (13th Den Tsushin)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the case of Lieutenant Colonel Saburo Aizawa, who assassinated Director of the Military Affairs Bureau Nagata, the military court of the 1st Division is currently conducting a preliminary examination. However, within the government, there is a desire to dispel the public's doubts about this case. It is believed that the details will be disclosed in detail when the interrogation reaches a certain point. This opinion is quite dominant. (13th Jiji News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e14">Silver Price Tied to Britain and America: British Broker Discusses the Fall in Silver Prices <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>(London) A major gold and silver broker told a Reuters reporter today, regarding the fall in silver prices yesterday, that the price at which the United States buys silver in London depends on the rise and fall of the US dollar. Whether the United States will fix its London purchase price at 68 US cents, or 30 and 1875/10000 British pence, has long been a question in the silver market. Yesterday's weakness of the US dollar was the discovery of the US authorities' decision to maintain the 68 cent base, which caused considerable disappointment in the London market, as the silver price is now tied to the British-American exchange rate. It is generally believed that the weakness of the US dollar is due to the massive US purchase of silver, but many knowledgeable people do not accept this view, believing that funds from continental Europe are flowing into Wall Street in the hope of participating in the American boom, which should absorb the US dollars sold as a result of the purchase of silver. The decline in the US dollar is probably due to the possibility of increased taxes in the United States, so Americans are buying pounds. The London foreign exchange market has not seen much trading recently because there is still fear regarding the use of gold countries. This is why the British Equalization Fund often backs the franc.

At the same time, the International Tea Committee will also encourage China and Taiwan to join the restriction plan.

<p>Panama: The United States is currently installing radio reconnaissance aircraft throughout the Republic of Panama to strengthen the defense of the Panama Canal Zone against air attacks. It is widely believed that this is largely due to Japan's growing influence in South America. Japan's activities are currently concentrated in Costa Rica and El Salvador, where it has obtained fishing concessions in the south. This concession will inevitably be the first step in Japan's efforts to conclude commercial treaties with Central American countries. The Americans see this move by the Japanese as not insignificant, as they are trying to obtain concessions for submarine and aircraft bases. Furthermore, there are currently many small Japanese shops in Panama, which is also causing Americans anxiety. (13th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japan has recently adopted a policy of actively protecting South American immigrants, specially instructing the 2nd Section of the America Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Yongiwa Affairs, to personally travel on immigration ships to conduct detailed investigations of immigrant life and sanitary conditions. It has also established the Imoto Hospital near Sao Paulo in Brazil to implement conservation practices. Foreign Minister Hirota has also appointed Henghengzheng Shinkou, a Doctor of Medicine from the 2nd Section of the America Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as Immigration Supervisor, and sent him to South American immigration areas and Europe and the United States to inspect the actual conditions of transplantation and conservation, in order to achieve comprehensive improvement. It is reported that Dr. Shinkou will depart from Yokohama on October 17th. After arriving in Brazil, he will travel to the suburbs of Sao Paulo along the Amazon River and deep into the South American interior to thoroughly investigate the status of Japanese transplantation. After a period of eight months, he will report his findings to the country in order to develop new developments for Japanese transplantation to South America. (13th Overseas Chinese News)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The commercial relationship between Japan and French Annam (Vietnam) was originally stipulated in the Japan-France Commercial Treaty concluded on May 13, Showa 7 (1932). However, this treaty does not stipulate the most-favored-nation clause except for specific commodities. Not only is Japan subjected to discriminatory high tariffs, putting it in an extremely unfavorable position, but the amount of exports from Annam to Japan has also been increasing in recent years. Therefore, Japan's trade with Annam is practically a one-way trade. As a result, the Japanese government wants to apply general measures to countries with excess imports to French Annam, in order to reorganize its imports and exports and to improve the transport of Japanese goods. It will soon submit a negotiation to the French government to revise the above-mentioned commercial treaty. If circumstances permit, it will not hesitate to abolish the current treaty.

<p>(Washington) Following former President Hoover's speech in Chicago yesterday, political speculation has become more active today. Political observers generally believe that Mr. Hoover's speech was the most straightforward criticism since he left the White House, and it strongly indicates that Mr. Hoover is willing to be the Republican candidate for next year's election. The Republican Party is currently holding a primary election for candidates. Senator Tolla received the most votes, followed by Mr. Knox, the publisher of the Chicago Daily News. The person in charge of this primary election is Mr. Rogers, the former Director-General of the Republican National Committee. Mr. Hoover did not receive many votes in the primary election, probably because most people did not know whether Mr. Hoover would accept the nomination. (12th National News)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Senate today rejected Mr. Black's bill for a 30-hour work week. If this bill had been passed, all major industries in the United States would have been forced to adopt a six-hour day, five-day week work system.

The bill was not put to a vote in the House of Representatives. Therefore, after being rejected by the Senate, it will not be reconsidered by the Senate before the adjournment of this session of Congress.

<h3 id="e22">Paris Three-Country Conference: Britain Has Positive Suggestions, Eden Arrives in France to Meet Laval <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>(London) Minister Without Portfolio Eden and other British representatives attending the conference on the Italian-Abyssinian dispute have departed for Paris today. (13th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Rome) Well-informed circles here believe that, regarding the upcoming three-country meeting in Paris between Britain, France, and Italy to discuss the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, Britain and France should be aware that Fascist Italy has become a new country since the signing of the 1906 treaty. Therefore, they should reconsider the overall situation with this new perspective. (13th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Paris) The three-country conference between Britain, France, and Italy is scheduled to be held here on the 16th. However, the agenda is not yet known. British Minister Without Portfolio Eden will arrive here from London tomorrow evening and will hold talks with Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval on Wednesday. Italian representative Aloisi will arrive here on Thursday morning. (12th Havas)</p>
<p>(London) It is generally believed that if the Paris conference between Britain, France, and Italy, discussing the Abyssinian issue, can find a basis for resolving the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, then the British government may change its original attitude regarding the location of the meeting and agree to hold the meeting in Italy so that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini can attend in person to seek a definite resolution to the dispute. (12th Havas)</p>
<p>(London) The claim that Minister Without Portfolio Eden will present positive suggestions at the three-country meeting between Britain, France, and Italy is gradually being confirmed. According to the Morning Post, if Italy agrees not to declare war on Abyssinia, then Eden may propose to modify the current state of distribution of African colonies. Furthermore, the Daily Telegraph believes that the British representative will present a plan at the three-country meeting that can promote the economic development of Abyssinia while also benefiting Britain's sphere of influence. (13th Havas)</p>
<p>(London) The three-country conference between Britain, France, and Italy is scheduled to be held in Paris next Friday. The following day, Italian and Abyssinian representatives will also meet here. It is generally believed that Eden has been ordered to propose a new solution to Italy in exchange for Italy abandoning war. This solution may formally recognize Prime Minister Mussolini's view that the Abyssinian issue should be discussed together with the European issue. On Tuesday, Eden plans to go to Paris to meet with Laval for preparatory talks before the start of the three-country conference. However, British public opinion is pessimistic about the outcome of the conference. Furthermore, although Germany has no representative at this meeting, it is actually in a pivotal position, as Italy cannot start a war against Abyssinia without hoping for the early establishment of the Central European Pact and the early stabilization of the Central European situation. Hitler knows this, so he also finds it advantageous to adopt an attitude of watchful waiting, so he will not cooperate with any party for the time being to resolve the Italian-Abyssinian conflict as soon as possible. (12th National News)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: The Abyssinian Emperor convened a council before the throne, stating that there is still hope for a peaceful resolution to the dispute with Italy before September 14th. He still believes that the League of Nations can uphold justice. The work for peace began after the European War, but now we are facing another opportunity for war, and the whole world will feel its impact. For this reason, Abyssinia is determined to maintain peace. Abyssinia will maintain the security within its borders but will never give up its independence and sovereignty. If Abyssinia is unfortunately drawn into war, it will fight to the end with the entire nation relying on its terrain. (12th National News)</p>

<p>Warsaw: Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck's visit to Finland has now concluded. He returned home today on the same ship he took to Finland.

Therefore, Beck's visit to Finland was to strengthen friendship. In addition, an official statement stated that Beck received a sincere welcome in Finland. Poland has no intention of concluding a new treaty with Finland to oppose any country, as Finland has always maintained a neutral policy and cannot ally with one country to oppose another.

The statement concluded that among the Baltic Sea countries, Poland and Finland are in a special position.

<p>British Silver: The London silver price eased slightly today, spot down 1.875, futures down 2.5, the price is the same at 29 pence 9375. India and China sold, the United States bought, trading was light, the closing market was stable.</p>
<p>American Silver: Although the London silver market fell, the opening price of futures in the Monterrey silver market did not change much.</p>
<p>Exchange Rates</p>
<p>British-American: The London foreign exchange market continued to be quiet this morning, with minimal fluctuations. The opening British-American exchange rate was $4.973125, up .0625 from yesterday's US-British exchange rate closing. This price did not change until 2:00 PM.</p>

<p>Cotton and Wheat</p>
<p>American Cotton: The New York cotton market fell slightly at the opening due to the Liverpool telegraph. However, after the opening, although the market was light, the price was still stable. Hedging mostly came from the South and Texas, but was absorbed by the industry. Cotton business is expected to improve, but the cotton market is still trending towards scarcity.</p>
<p>British Cotton: The Liverpool cotton market eased slightly today. The October futures price fell by four pound tones in the morning to 5.93.</p>
<p>British Wheat: The Liverpool wheat market fell slightly at the opening to sympathize with yesterday's North American market.

At 1:00 PM, the October futures price was 5 shillings 0375, down 1 and 875 pence from yesterday's closing.</p>
<p>American Wheat: The Liverpool cotton price fell, and the Argentina telegraph was disappointing, so the opening price of the Chicago wheat market fell accordingly.

However, industry purchases were slightly more than before, and short selling was recently lacking, so after the opening, the wheat price returned to yesterday's closing price. The opening price of grains was also slightly lower, and then rose due to short covering, especially in the long term.</p>

<p>New York: The New York stock market was slightly inactive at the opening this morning. There was continued profit-taking, and securities prices generally trended downward, but the decline was not large. There was a turnaround in the air, and the underlying sentiment still favored higher prices. Silver mining stocks fell due to lower silver prices in London and Mumbai. However, the decline in the London silver price was due to the weakness of the US dollar, not due to a lack of buyers. The Dow Jones 30 Industrial Average opened at 128.07, up seven pound tones.

<h3 id="e79">Impressions of a Southern Tour - Our Newspaper's Special Shanghai Reporter Qian Hua <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>(V) Southern Summer Resorts</p>
<p>Hong Kong was originally a barren island. After decades of deliberate management by the British, it has almost all been developed. Roads are built around the mountains, winding and passable. The reporter and Mr. Zhang hired a car to tour the entire Hong Kong Island at sunset. Driving up the hills and winding around the mountains, the peaks are layered and verdant. Looking out at the seaside, fishing boats are silent. There are waterfalls, lakes, secluded trees, and villas. The natural beauty is embellished by artificial touches, as if one is in a painting, reluctant to leave. There is a funicular railway that can go directly to the top of the mountain. From the parking lot at the foot of the mountain to the mountain top station, it is 1,190 feet above sea level. The temperature at the foot of the mountain that day was 92 degrees, and the thermometer at the mountain top station was 78 degrees. A cool breeze was blowing, refreshing the whole body. It takes another 20 minutes to walk to the top, overlooking the entire Hong Kong. The highest point is the British military's fort and military radio station, which is off-limits. Villas are like clouds on the mountain, all inhabited by millionaires or wealthier, where they can recuperate and eliminate all worries. It is truly a famous southern summer resort. At the foot of the mountain there is a very large racetrack and a seaside bathing beach. It is said that Chen Mingshu, Cai Tingkai, and others go to the seaside bathing beach to swim every day.</p>
<p>(VI) What I Saw on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Train</p>
<p>From Hong Kong to Guangzhou, one can take the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway by land, which takes three hours. By water, one can take the Hong Kong-Guangdong steamer, which takes seven hours, but one can enjoy the scenery of the Pearl River along the way. The reporter left Hong Kong at 4:00 PM on the second, took the ferry to Kowloon, and then took the Guangzhou-Kowloon train directly to Guangzhou from Kowloon Station at 4:50 PM. I planned to take the waterway back to Hong Kong from Guangzhou on my return journey so that I could see both land and water, and not be partial. The Guangzhou-Kowloon train is jointly operated by China and Britain. It is clean, stable, and fast, and the timetable is very accurate. There are many mountains along the way, which is very different from the scenery of the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Beijing-Shanghai lines. Looking out the window, more than one-third of the fields along the entire line were flooded. One can imagine the severity of the flood in Guangdong. People in the train said that this was the third major flood, probably affected by the flood in Fujian, coupled with mountain torrents, which were unable to be discharged, resulting in immeasurable losses. We arrived in Guangzhou at 7:45 PM, the lights shone brightly, and the train sounds were loud and noisy. The lively scene was only slightly less than that of Shanghai. It is indeed the largest city in the southwest. The next day, with a friend from Guangzhou as a guide, I hired a car to tour the city, visited the Tomb of the Seventy-Two Martyrs of Huanghuagang, the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Monument, and the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall. The Municipal Government is located in the center of the city, and the architecture is also palatial. Sun Yat-sen Park is located opposite the Municipal Government. The roads are wide and flat, and the Western-style buildings are tall and grand. Guangzhou has all the tools of a modern city. What is even more precious is that Guangzhou is a purely Chinese-built city, and it is on par with the Shanghai and Tianjin concessions. In Shamian, the British and French concessions in Guangzhou, it is secluded in a corner, the situation is dim, and commerce is declining. I sincerely hope that the Greater Shanghai Plan will succeed one day, moving the prosperous streets such as Nanjing Road to the city center, and replicating the changes that have occurred in the Shamian concession today.</p>

<h3 id="e80">Western Shandong Province: The Widespread Flooding Continues; Over 100,000 Disaster Victims Sheltered in Various Counties <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from Jinan reports that since the breaches and collapses along the Yellow River in this province, coupled with the continuous influx of floodwaters from Tongguan and Shaanxi, alerts have been frequent since the 8th. On the evening of the 10th, the provincial government chairman, Han Fuqu, received a telegram from Wang Shaochang, the chief administrator of the western Shandong experimental zone, reporting that the upstream floodwaters from Shaanxi Province were surging downwards, and the flow below Liuzhuang was exceptionally turbulent. In Heze County, the Zhukou dangerous section had sufficient stone materials, and due to proactive reinforcement and effective emergency efforts, it had not yet been breached despite being directly hit by the flood. However, at the northern end of the Jiangsu embankment below Zhukou, due to the immense and forceful water, over twenty meters were successively washed away by the rapid current on the evening of the 10th. Consequently, the current became even more rapid. At the old breach in Juancheng County, the floodwaters breached the layers of civilian embankments and government dikes, flowing eastward in two branches from Linpuji. The larger branch headed directly towards the northern border of Heze, already overflowing the newly built civilian embankments in Dehua Township, flooding over the top of the embankments without obstruction. The smaller branch threatened to inundate Yuncheng's southern regions, potentially flooding Niuye and Jiaxiang again. As for the remaining embankment head east of Dongzhuangkou, it was collapsing under the force of the flood, encroaching upon civilian embankments. Emergency repairs had been ongoing for several days, and the situation had become increasingly critical since the day before yesterday. Not only was the remaining embankment still collapsing, but the retaining dike was also sinking. Yesterday (the 11th), the flow did not abate, with the main current closely abutting the southern section of the civilian-built retaining dike, eroding about several tens of zhang (a unit of length). Qin Daoyu and Chen Wenmo, recognizing the critical situation, purchased cash-based earth materials to reinforce the bank and installed support piles and willow bundles, throwing bags to protect the slope. With these emergency measures, the collapse has slightly stabilized. After receiving the report, the River Affairs Bureau, in addition to instructing Qin Daoyu and Chen Wenmo to actively carry out emergency repairs and expedite civilian repairs, also borrowed dragon ropes from the Yellow River Water Conservancy Committee for binding willow branches for protection. Furthermore, the Jiangsu embankment near the Linshengtun outlet, which prevented the entire river from diverting southward after this year's breach, was due to the work of diverting the flow towards the Jiangsu embankment. However, currently, its first embankment is affected by the drainage from the outlet, with an exceptionally fierce current. The fifth, sixth, and seventh groynes are either shifting or being destroyed. Soldiers and laborers from that section are bundling piles to provide protection. Although the ice is receding, the current remains ferocious, and the construction base has collapsed by forty to fifty zhang. As of last night, they were using burlap sacks to throw bricks to reinforce the pressure. According to a telegram from Zhuang Shouzhong, the magistrate of Dong'e County, at 5 PM on the 10th, the Yellow River's water level surged, and the second Niu Tun dam was breached by the powerful current, with a length of eight chi (a unit of length) and a width of one zhang two chi. The fourth dam was also breached, with a length of one zhang and a width of two zhang. The magistrate immediately went to the work site to supervise the laborers and flood prevention chief, Liu Fuyan, in their efforts to install willow branches for emergency protection. The small rivers, flooded by both the Yellow River and the converging water, had long reached their capacity. Now, the Qili River in Heze is being inundated by the large breach from Juancheng flowing through Dehua Township. Due to the substantial volume, several sections of the downstream civilian embankments were breached, directly threatening the northern embankments of the Zhao Wang River. The villages in the northern part of Dingtao County are all feeling the impact of the Yellow River. Ten thousand laborers have been mobilized, joining the twenty thousand laborers in Heze to desperately carry out protective measures. In the Anxingmu area downstream of the river, the Yellow River's floodwaters rose steeply by one meter and seven cun (a unit of length). The higher ground in the vicinity, which initially suffered less damage when the floodwaters first arrived, now has all its villages completely submerged. In Yuncheng County, the Yellow River's water had originally approached the city walls, but fortunately, there was a large protective embankment for defense. However, the water level has now increased by four hua chi (a unit of length), and many leaks have been discovered in the protective embankment, with the Yellow River seeping into the embankment, making the situation critical. If the Juancheng breach water arrives again, it may be difficult to ensure safety, and the county seat will inevitably be flooded. The disaster area is expanding, making the future difficult to predict. The Yellow River's water in Juye has risen another one chi, already reaching the base of the city walls. There is a shortage of piling materials in the city, and boats have been dispatched to neighboring counties for purchase. The houses in the flooded villages, which had not previously collapsed, have now all collapsed due to prolonged submersion. County Magistrate Gong Min is defending the county seat day and night. Also, according to news from Yuncheng, the Songjin River's water level has risen by one chi and five cun from the 10th to the 11th. The protective embankment has repeatedly faced danger, with repairs in one area leading to breaches in another. At 2 AM on the 10th, two breaches occurred simultaneously in the southwest and northeast, and efforts are being made to repair them. The waters of Yutai Lake are overflowing, and news is delayed. As of yesterday, a report from County Magistrate Yang Qidong on the 9th stated that the water level in lakes such as Zhaoyang and Shushan was continuously increasing. The lake embankments north of Wanfu River and south of Ma Pit were completely submerged, and boats could pass through anywhere. After several days and nights of emergency repairs by officials and civilians, the western branch river's eastern bank in Chenwan in the third district, gave way on the afternoon of the 9th when strong winds and waves arose, with two breaches, each several tens of zhang wide. The third district is now indistinguishable from the lake and river, a vast expanse of water. Furthermore, according to a telegram from Jining, the water level in the upper reaches of the Grand Canal, at Dachangou Anju, has risen three cun, while the lower reaches, at Luqiao, have not risen. The water from the breach at Xindian has risen one cun, with no change in area. The water between the Zhao Wang River and the Shu River has risen one cun. Both Shushan Lake and Nanyang Lake have risen one cun. The water in the 12th Transport Depression has decreased by one cun.</p>
<p>The disaster area in western Shandong is expanding daily, with the number of disaster victims reaching five million. The provincial government has established shelters in counties that have not been affected, providing them with accommodation. Later, Wang Shaochang, the chief administrator of the experimental zone, believed that it was difficult to transport disaster victims back and forth, so it would be more convenient to establish shelters directly in the affected counties. Thus, shelters were added in ten counties, including Heze and Dingtao. As of now, the statistics show that the forty-eight shelters in unaffected counties have accommodated 65,417 disaster victims. The number of disaster victims already accommodated within the disaster area is not included. Roughly, it is estimated that there are already more than one hundred thousand people. There are undoubtedly many more who are being transported or who are guarding their property and unwilling to leave. Here is a list of the number of disaster victims accommodated in the forty-eight shelters in the unaffected counties: Jinan City 9,626, Dezhou 1,387, Teng County 1,706, Zou County 815, Qufu 893, Pingyuan 637, Tai'an 1,685, Ziyang 836, Zouping 300, Zhangqiu 2,000, Yidu 2,000, Changshan 1,200, Changle 1,300, Linzi 1,000, Zichuan 1,000, Weixian 1,500, Jiaoxian 1,959, Jimo 1,500, Sishui 600, Gaomi 1,300, Qihe 1,000, Ningyang 1,000, Pingyin 800, Yixian 1,000, Huantai 1,634, Dong'e 1,500, Anqiu 1,583, Jiyang 1,200, Linba 669, Gaoyuan 600, Linqu 1,000, Changyi 1,000, Enxian 1,000, Changqing 1,000, Gaotang 1,000, Deping 800, Yexian 1,500, Lingxian 1,200, Shouguang 1,200, Zhucheng 1,500, Guangrao 1,200, Boshan 1,200, Feicheng 600, Chiping 1,000, Wucheng 1,000, Shanghe 1,200, Pingdu 1,500, Licheng 2,277. The total is 65,417 people. (12th)</p>
<p>Songjiang</p>
<p>Supervisory Committee Inspects the Seawall</p>
<p>The Huating seawall in Punan, this county, has recently been struck by a hurricane and collapsed for more than ten zhang, which is quite dangerous. County Magistrate Jin has ordered the seawall patrol officer, Yang Yongnian, to protect the wall at all times, and has also submitted a request to the Construction Department for funds to repair it. The Provincial Water Conservancy Department has also sent Engineer Wang to Songjiang to oversee the project. Yesterday, Supervisory Committee member Yu Hongqi arrived in Songjiang and, accompanied by County Magistrate Jin and Xu Mojia, the chief of the Technology Section, inspected the seawall at Jinshanwei, deeming it necessary to carry out repairs. He returned to Songjiang that day. It is heard that the Provincial Department has already invited tenders for the project according to the plan.</p>
<p>Investigation of the Parricide Case in Mojialong</p>
<p>Zhang Shunxi, a resident of Mojialong, plotted to kill his mother. The Baojia chief reported the matter to the Public Security Bureau, which arrested him and handed him over to the local court. This case caused a sensation in the city. Today, the Procuratorate summoned witnesses Fang Zhu, Zhang Li, Zhang Yousheng, Chu Linsheng, Chu Lin, and Township Police Xu Yongqing for separate interrogations. They all testified about the discord between mother and son. Subsequently, Zhang Shunxi also confessed, admitting to plotting the murder. After the interrogation, the court ordered him to be detained.</p>
<p>Hangzhou</p>
<p>Lin'an County: Prohibition of Selling and Smoking Cigarettes</p>
<p>Lin'an County has prohibited the sale and smoking of cigarettes, incorporating this into the Baojia regulations. Cigarette shops in the county, believing that the county magistrate was forcing them to stop business, cutting off their livelihood, submitted a petition to the provincial government for relief. On the occasion of renewing their licenses in the autumn, they still prepared taxes in accordance with the regulations and applied to the county government for cigarette licenses. Currently, more than a dozen households have been approved by the county government. Those who have obtained licenses then requested cigarettes from the Yuhang cigarette distributors. Yesterday (the 8th), cigarette distributors such as Yuhang Chengchang sent partners Zhou Fuxing and Wang Boting, carrying a total of nineteen cartons of various cigarettes to Lin'an. When they arrived at the station, they were seized by the county's security team and police officers stationed at the station and escorted to the county government, then transferred to the town office for punishment. The town mayor did not accept the case, so the chief of the Public Security Section interrogated them and escorted them out of the territory. Local cigarette shops, believing that the county was illegally interfering with their business, sent letters to the Hangzhou Cigarette Industry Association, requesting assistance. The association has separately submitted petitions to the provincial government and the Tax Administration of the Ministry of Finance, requesting that they be dispatched to thoroughly investigate and effectively protect them.</p>
<p>Ningbo</p>
<p>Another Qianzhuang (Native Bank) Closes in Ningbo</p>
<p>Since the unprecedented financial turmoil occurred in Ningbo's qian industry, the financial sector has been in a state of terror. All sectors are expecting County Magistrate Chen and others to successfully borrow 2 million yuan from the three banks in Shanghai, so that the closed qianzhuang all have the hope of resuming business. Now I learned that County Magistrate Chen has returned without any specific measures, and the fearful people cannot be stabilized. Depositors continue to rush to withdraw money. Yesterday, the Xiaotong Tong Qianzhuang on Jiangxia Street also stopped collecting and paying, announcing liquidation. It is found that the capital of the bank is 44,000 yuan, and the shareholders are Wu Zhinian, Fan Zhenyuan, Zhang Nanjin, Xu Disun, Li Dihui, and Wu Ruilin. The manager is Zhang Nanjin. Usually, the business is relatively stable. Recently, due to the financial turmoil in the qian industry, depositors withdrew their deposits, and the shareholders of the bank added an additional 30,000 yuan of capital. The accumulated profit for the past years is 40,000 yuan. The deposits are 161,000 yuan, the current deposits are 72,000 yuan, the temporary account is 6,000 yuan, the peer debt is 31,000 yuan, the Shanghai foreign market is 30,000 yuan, the Ningbo foreign market is 70,000 yuan, and the debt is 284,000 yuan. The bank still has a surplus between its receipts and payments. Because depositors have difficulty in withdrawing cash, it had no choice but to announce liquidation yesterday.</p>

<h3 id="e82">The National Products Association and the Loan Association Discuss Loan Opinions; Credit Loans for Small Factories Should Be Lent as Much as Possible; The Loan Association Replied Yesterday with the Handling of the Loan <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Yu Hede and others, the executive committee members of the Municipal Citizens' Promotion of National Products Association, recently compiled the opinions of the National Products Factory on various items of industrial and commercial loans and submitted them to the Industrial and Commercial Loan Review Committee for adoption. The Loan Association replied yesterday with the handling of small credit loans, saying that the association's main purpose is to effectively relieve small industrial and commercial businesses and stabilize the market situation, and that it will provide convenience to each applicant within the possible scope. The official letters exchanged between the two associations are as follows:</p>
<p>Original letter from the National Products Association</p>
<p>Director: In the state of the world's economic depression and weak social consumption, our national products industry bears the brunt and feels the pain of maintaining hardship and regulating deficits. The entire national products industry is in its infancy and is suddenly hit, and the trend is in danger. It is of great importance to the national economy and people's livelihood. The whole country is planning to relieve and treat the symptoms and root causes at the same time, to reverse the decline and achieve stability together. Our association is a group of national products factories, sharing the danger and having the will to relieve, but lacking the ability to implement. According to the opinions repeatedly stated by the member factories, (1) Collateral loans are based on capital and credit, and are suitable for the implementation of medium and large factories, but not for the operation of small factories. (2) Small factories have no previous dealings with the silver and money industries, and they are very eager for credit loans of three to five hundred yuan. They should be loaned as much as possible to implement relief, and the qualifications of the guarantor should be lenient. (3) Credit loans should strictly limit the factories that manufacture national products and the stores that sell national products to obtain loans, and prevent leaks. It is about the government's relief to factories and the revival of the national products industry. Please grant our request for investigation and handling. The national products industry relies heavily on it.</p>
<p>Reply from the Loan Association</p>
<p>Director: Received your association's public letter No. 5513, acknowledging the opinions of the National Products Factory on industrial and commercial loans. We have learned that our association follows the orders of the ministry and handles the review and loan of industrial and commercial credit loans, with the main purpose of effectively relieving small industrial and commercial businesses and stabilizing the market situation. Regarding the condition that loan manufacturers are limited to those who operate national products, it is regarded as the only principle. Recently, we approved the letter from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, which transferred the request from the Noodle Industry Association for the member stores to change the guarantee procedures, with three joint guarantees and the association's seal, to apply for a small loan of less than 100 yuan. Our association has approved the change at the seventh meeting and can approve the loan after requesting instructions from the Ministry of Finance. It is also found that it is difficult for loan applicants to find two reliable commercial firms to guarantee them in accordance with the ten principles for loans promulgated by the ministry. It has also been decided to recommend that the Ministry of Finance change it to one shop guarantee to show consideration for each case. All these measures coincide with your brilliant insights. Our association provides convenience to each applicant within the possible scope. This kind of service spirit should be seen by the society. We have approved the letter and replied accordingly, hoping that you will check it for our reference.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Ministry of Finance: Urging Repayment of Financial Public Bonds; Orders the Money Trade Supervision Committee to Notify All Firms <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The Shen Shi News Agency reports that the Ministry of Finance previously allocated 25 million yuan in financial public bonds from the 24th year of the Republic to relieve the panic in the money trade industry. At that time, the Ministry of Finance also appointed Xu Kan, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Gu Gechu, Qin Runqing, and others to form a Money Trade Supervision Committee to manage the lending affairs. Various money shops submitted relatively reliable collateral, which, after being reviewed and approved by the Supervision Committee, allowed them to receive financial public bond notes. They then used these notes to borrow cash from major banks such as the Bank of China at 80% of the face value to meet their needs. The money trade crisis at that time was able to be smoothly overcome due to the maintenance provided by these 25 million yuan in financial public bonds. A Shen Shi News Agency reporter learned yesterday that the Ministry of Finance believes that the period for which these public bonds were lent to the money trade has exceeded two months, and that the Shanghai money market is gradually easing, with the "劃頭" (discount rate) reduced to "白," and financial conditions have returned to a state of calm. The previously allocated financial public bonds should be urged for repayment at the opportune moment so that the public bonds can be allocated for other purposes. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance recently ordered the Money Trade Supervision Committee to separately notify each shop to find ways to redeem the previous loans to bring the matter to a conclusion. Yesterday, it was also reported by the money trade side that various shops are currently trying to repay the loans borrowed from the Ministry of Finance in succession. However, although the current money trade is gradually turning around due to loans related to silk and tea, and the financial situation is indeed more advanced than several months ago, the general industrial and commercial situation has not yet fully improved. It is inevitable that there are still considerable difficulties in loaning and collecting accounts. It is difficult to fully repay the loans borrowed from the Ministry of Finance all at once. However, all firms are indeed separately raising funds to repay them to the best of their ability. Moreover, each shop has fully provided reliable collateral and considerable interest for this loan. If any shop has available cash to circulate, it is also willing to repay it as soon as possible to clear the formalities. The financial authorities are also very clear about all these circumstances.</p>

Therefore, it was proposed for discussion at the standing committee meeting convened by the Bankers Association yesterday afternoon. A preliminary allocation has been made, and a resolution will be reached after further contact with the responsible persons of various banks.</p>

<h3 id="e88">The Dutch East Indies Still Discriminating Against Chinese; Recently Plans to Promulgate Import Tax on Chinese Goods to Restrict the Sale of Chinese Goods at Low Prices <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the Dutch East Indies has been secretly discriminating against foreigners in recent years, especially against Chinese immigrants entering and leaving the islands, treating them more harshly than immigrants from Europe and the United States. Therefore, an import tax on Chinese immigrants was once promulgated to restrict the entry of Chinese immigrants. Later, after the Chinese Envoy to the Netherlands, Jin Wensi, was instructed by the government to argue with the Dutch authorities based on reason, demanding that the Dutch East Indies treat Filipino-Chinese immigrants equally with European and American immigrants in law, the matter subsided after repeated negotiations between the two sides. According to the news from the Chinese Expatriate Federation in this port, the Dutch East Indies recently plans to promulgate an import tax on Chinese goods. It is said that the purpose of setting this tax rate is to restrict Chinese goods from being sold at low prices in the Dutch East Indies. It is reported that the Chinese goods that have a considerable position in the Dutch East Indies market are tea, cotton cloth, and cosmetics.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Petition from the Rent Reduction Association in the Special District; Requesting the Party and Government to Clearly Define Rent Reduction Measures; Scheduled to Hold an Enlarged Petition <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The Ren Gong News Agency reports that the First Special District Low Rent Committee, in order to request the government to clearly order rent reduction to stabilize society, resolved at its first executive committee meeting to send representatives to the party and government agencies on the 16th of this month to hold an enlarged petition, and decided to hold a rent reduction campaign week from the 25th to the 31st to attract attention. The association specially submitted petitions to the Municipal Party Department, the Municipal Government, and the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, requesting the clear definition of rent reduction measures. The original petition stated that: "Submitting a petition for the purpose of stating the difficulties of the times and the hardship of the people, due to the depression in the market and the decline in commerce, and requesting the clear definition of rent reduction measures to maintain the situation. Since the end of the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, the social economy has been extremely panicked. The general public lives in fear and is on the verge of desperation. They run around and cry out, all hoping that the market will become more prosperous again. However, falling prices expose the weakness of people's purchasing power. Frequent lawsuits show the instability of social order. Thieves are rampant and take advantage of the situation. Starving people fill the streets in the thousands, and the situation is getting worse. The reason for this is all due to the social and economic panic. There are many ways to solve the social and economic problems. However, it has been found that the most severely exploited group among the current Shanghai citizens, and what often becomes the fatal blow to their livelihood and career, is the item of rent. The real estate industry in Shanghai is entirely speculative. A small amount of capital is used to obtain hundreds of times the profit, and it is resold repeatedly, accumulating interest. In the past, in a prosperous market, when industry and commerce were thriving and the social economy was active, it was still possible to exhaust the pond to catch the fish and drink poison to quench thirst. But now, with the depression in all industries and the depletion of the social economy, citizens who rent houses are really unable to continue to bear the high prices. Even if the welfare of the masses is not what those who operate real estate want to hear, high-rise buildings are closed one after another. People cannot live, and there is no one living in the houses. Regardless of whether this has an impact on individual economic relations or not, it affects society in a way that is great and huge. As a metropolis known as the Eastern civilization, how can we tolerate this phenomenon? Foreigners often criticize us as a society without order or organization, which they have seen and said. The Three People's Principles of the President of the Party place the greatest emphasis on the Principle of People's Livelihood, and the four needs of the Principle of People's Livelihood are listed and emphasized equally. Now, the citizens of Shanghai feel particularly pained by the housing problem, and the impact of this is likely to affect the whole body. The association is deeply saddened by this and cannot remain silent. Therefore, we submit this document and respectfully ask you to examine the plight of the citizens and quickly order a clear plan to reduce rents in order to maintain the situation and alleviate the hardship of the people. We are extremely grateful."</p>

<p>Fan Deran, a paper-making expert and the current director of the Hunan Paper Mill, arrived in Shanghai from Hunan a few days ago. He has been visiting various paper mills in this port for days, purchasing materials, and attending banquets in various places, which has been very busy. He was originally scheduled to return to Hunan immediately to preside over the factory affairs. Now, due to physical discomfort, he intends to stay for a few more days. It is reported that he has sought medical treatment at the clinic of Dr. Huang Shaoshi, a Belgian medical doctor, using a shortwave diathermy apparatus to perform new-style electrotherapy and gradually recover his health. According to Fan, Hunan Province promoted machine paper-making, starting with the Huafeng Paper Mill in the first year of the Republic of China. The factory was originally a joint venture between the government and merchants. However, after the machine was installed, it failed repeatedly. Coupled with the impact of the political situation, it was suspended for more than 20 years. Many machine parts were lost, and those that remained were rusted. He (Fan said of himself) returned to Hunan from Paris and served in the Construction Department as a construction specialist. He was ordered to survey the factory. Seeing the dilapidated houses, he could not help but feel the desolation of the Hunan industry. After detailed investigation, he believed that although the factory's machines were incomplete and uneven, they could still be used if repaired. Rather than spending money and time to create a new factory, it was better to restore it on the existing foundation. After there was production performance, it could be expanded again. Therefore, he reported to the Construction Department, drafted a restoration plan, and submitted it to the Provincial Affairs Conference for approval. He reorganized the Hunan Paper Company, which was still a joint venture between the government and merchants. In July of last year, he started the machine test. At the same time, a cotton wadding factory was established near the yarn factory, using the factory's waste cotton as raw material. Products such as Mei Xuan, Tang Pinggong, and Material Half paper have been produced for printing stationery, envelopes, books, and forms. However, using waste cotton as raw material may have limited sources. In the future, as the quantity of products increases, there may be a shortage. Therefore, rice straw produced in Hunan was used as raw material, and kraft and newsprint papers have been produced. Its toughness is no less than that of imported products.</p>

<p>The Central News Agency reports that Li Jingzong, general manager of the Euro-Asia Aviation Corporation, went to Beiping for business and returned south to Beijing on the 12th. He originally planned to take the overnight train to Shanghai to negotiate the opening of the Shaanxi-Rong line. The company received a telegram and Secretary Zha Zhenhu and others went to the station to meet him, but they did not see him. It is reported that Li had to consult with Zhu Jiahua, Minister of Communications, so he did not leave Beijing on the night of the 12th. According to Secretary Zha, the results of the Shaanxi-Rong line trial flight show that there are still technical areas that need to be researched. It is necessary to wait for General Manager Li to come to Shanghai to discuss with the air navigation group and then submit a report to the ministry for approval. The mountains along the Shaanxi-Rong line are high and continuous, with almost no flat land. The route is not easy to identify, and in the event of an accident, it is not easy to find a safe place to land. The difficulty of its navigation is even greater than that of the western section of the Shanghai-Xinjiang line. For the sake of aviation safety, it is necessary to conduct careful research.</p>

This organization has already forwarded it to the Ceramic Industry Association, which has recommended one person and will reply to you in another letter today. However, this organization has further intentions. The insurance and notarization business in our country is entirely in the hands of foreigners. Those in charge have long sought reform. Your association is purely Chinese merchants and should be the first to make a statement. Reading your letter, this matter is still handled by the Sanyi Notary Office, which is inevitable to follow the old ways and make people lose hope. It has been found that the Yizhong Auction House has a public appraisal department. If your association can earnestly discuss with colleagues and jointly seek to promote reform, then the accumulated habits of decades will be changed, and the way will be opened for the self-operated notarization by Chinese people. Not only will your association be praised, but policyholders will also feel extremely convenient. Those who have insured with foreign merchants may even compete to switch to Chinese merchants. We hope that your association will overcome all difficulties and strive for it."</p>

<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reports that, apart from the American expert committee member on telephone issues hired by the Public Concession Engineering Bureau, who is expected to arrive in Shanghai around the 20th, the Chinese, British, and Japanese committee members have arrived in Shanghai one after another in the past two days. Therefore, yesterday, they first discussed the research questions entrusted by the Engineering Bureau in the conference hall of the Engineering Bureau. A formal four-nation expert meeting will be held after the American expert arrives in Shanghai. It is reported that the research and discussion period of the committee is temporarily set at two months. As for the matters entrusted by the Engineering Bureau Board of Directors to the expert committee for investigation, they are limited to three items: whether there is the right to increase telephone charges, whether equipment and expenses are economical, and whether charging by the number of calls is applicable. The issue of exchange rate decline, the issue of income tax paid to the United States, and the issue of operating expenses (personnel expenses) will not be included in the scope of the expert committee's research. Furthermore, Dr. Inada, the Japanese telephone expert, arrived in Shanghai on the Japanese ship Shanghai Maru at 3:30 PM on the 12th (the day before yesterday). Those who went to the Osaka Wharf to welcome him included Bu Bu, the Japanese director of the Engineering Bureau, Sugimoto, the acting head of the Japanese Overseas Chinese Group, Fukuda, director of the Engineering Bureau's Finance Department, and Philip, the deputy director of administrative affairs.

<p>The deadline for human-powered vehicle registration in the special district is set for the 15th of this month. The Human-Powered Vehicle Association Special District Office issued a notice to the vehicle owners' introductions, the original text of which is: "For the purpose of notification, regarding the registration of rickshaw pullers in our special district, since it was heard that the Engineering Bureau had a deadline of July 31, after repeated written negotiations by this office, it was only allowed that if there are unregistered rickshaw pullers, they should be limited to bringing the vehicle to the original registration office for registration from August 1 to 15 to remedy the situation. Now, the deadline is not far away. We hope that each vehicle owner will step up the supervision of unregistered rickshaw pullers, send them to register as much as possible. It is necessary to know that this matter concerns the future of driving, the more the better, and do not miss the opportunity. Another item of testing and donation of new vehicles, the original plan was to test every two months, which has been changed to inspection once every four months. Later, due to poor vehicle repairs and unclean washing, the authorities believed that it affected the appearance of the city and informed that inspections should be carried out every two months. After serious negotiations by the representatives of this office, the result was that new vehicles, if they can be properly organized, will be allowed to be tested every four months, otherwise, the deadline for vehicle testing will still be handled according to the original intentions. The length of the deadline for vehicle testing depends on whether the vehicle owners can seriously organize it. The above two items are deeply related to the survival of the vehicle industry. At this time of business decline and the authorities' harsh demands, all our special district vehicle merchants must pay special attention and follow them diligently, and must not delay and make mistakes, which will lead to regrets in the future. This is a warning."</p>

The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau has budgeted all the implementation expenses and has petitioned the Ministry of Transportation to request the Ministry of Education to include an insurance lesson in elementary school textbooks to instill insurance knowledge in the people. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Regulations Announced: The simplified life insurance matter has been actively prepared by the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation. Drawing reference from state-run and private life insurance practices in England, America, and Japan, it drafted regulations comprising seventy-two articles, submitting them to the Ministry of Transportation, which then forwarded them to the Executive Yuan for review. The Executive Yuan revised and reduced them to seventy-one articles, which have been formally approved and promulgated. The Bureau's insurance division has completed the actuarial tables for mortality based on age, as well as examples of premium calculations. It is currently drafting various internal operational guidelines.</p>
<p>Budgeted Expenses: A reporter from the Da Gong She visited Zhang Mingting, the deputy director of the Insurance Division of the Savings and Remittance Bureau yesterday morning. When asked about the implementation time of simplified life insurance, he replied that although the regulations have been announced by the central government, the internal preparation procedures are quite complicated. The nature of simplified life insurance differs from ordinary private life insurance businesses. Currently, the total opening expenses are being budgeted. The Bureau hopes to implement it by mid-September, but it is still questionable whether all the procedures can be completed by then.</p>
<p>Insurance Textbook: Director Zhang also mentioned that various countries have achieved extraordinary development in the life insurance business. In Japan, simplified insurance has been incorporated into school textbooks to instill common knowledge in the public and promote their interest. The Bureau is also emulating this approach and has petitioned the Ministry of Transportation to request the Ministry of Education to add a simplified life insurance lesson to elementary school textbooks to promote awareness and increase knowledge. The Ministry of Transportation has shown great approval and has forwarded it to the Ministry of Education for adoption and implementation.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, aiming to popularize health work in the urban area, originally planned to establish health centers in various districts to be responsible for local health, disease prevention, environmental sanitation, and other health-related work. However, due to the high cost, it could not be completed urgently. Therefore, it adopted a method of establishing them year by year. Districts such as Gaoqiao, Wusong, Jiangwan, and Hunan have been established successively from 1929 to 1934. However, the municipal government considers this administrative organization an essential task for protecting the people's health and decided to establish the Hubei District and Pudong District Health Centers in 1935, even in times of financial constraints. The Zhabei District Health Center, located on Qingyun Road, began construction in the middle of last month and is expected to be fully completed by the end of November this year. The budget for construction and equipment is limited to 50,000 yuan.</p>

<p>The American Tobacco Improvement Committee of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, for the purpose of improving Xuchang tobacco, specially purchased a large batch of American seeds starting this year and transported them to Xuchang and other counties for distribution, and dispatched specialists to guide on-site.

This year's Xuchang tobacco production is relatively abundant, and the quality is also better. However, due to the impact of wind and flood disasters, it is expected that the production, although abundant, will only be about 15% more than last year. The price is also expected to increase.</p>

<p>Accountants Pan Xulun, Wang Haifan, and others, noting the increasing development of domestic fire and marine insurance and the growing number of loss compensation cases, and that there are few Chinese professionals specializing in adjusting services for insurance companies and policyholders, and considering that the appraisal of assets and promissory notes falls within the scope of accounting, while arbitration and appraisal are also defined duties of accountants, in order to fulfill their original intentions of serving the community, have gathered experts to establish the United Insurance Adjusting Firm. The office is currently located on the first floor of the Jinxing Building, 505 Henan Road, aiming to resolve any dangerous loss fairly and promptly for both insurance companies and policyholders with an impartial and selfless attitude.

<p>For the past month, Shanghai and its surrounding towns have experienced frequent heavy rains. From 8:00 AM this morning, Shanghai experienced another heavy rain, pouring down for about an hour before slowing slightly. However, light rain continued to fall until noon. After the heavy rain, the sky was dark, and lights were needed indoors. Water accumulated to a depth of one chi in low-lying areas of the city. Even the Sichuan Road and Wangping Street areas, which had been elevated, were submerged to the ankles. Water was even deeper in the area of the South Railway Station in Nanshi. Crossing streets relied entirely on rickshaw crossings, so rickshaw pullers enjoyed profits three times higher than usual. As for the current state of the fields, now is the time to spread fertilizer. After the heavy rain this morning, those who had already applied fertilizer were washed away, which is also a loss for farmers.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Fundraising Variety Show for Flood Relief: Public Announcement Issued Yesterday, Entertainment Troupes and Flower World Entertained Yesterday <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The fundraising variety show for flood relief organized by various circles in Shanghai is scheduled to open on the 16th and will last for three weeks. Yesterday, the association held a second reception for entertainment troupes and the flower world and issued a public announcement. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Entertainment Troupes and Flower World Entertained</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM yesterday, the association entertained entertainment troupes, including Ziye Lehui, Rose Troupe, Meimei Troupe, Black Cat Troupe, Da Shanghai Singing Society, Lu Qiqi, Zhao Xixi, Bai Yuquan, Zhong Xinxiao, Xiao Pengfei, Xu Shengxiang, Fei Xixi, Qiu Cuihua, Xiao Xiangyun, Shaolin Society, Feiwu Troupe, Children's Troupe, Yu Yupin, and others. They were led by Ding Shoutang and Yuan Zengshuo, directors of the entertainment department. It was decided that they would perform at arranged times. After 6:00 PM, a reception for senior members of the flower world, with over 50 people, was held at the Atlantic Western Restaurant, hosted by Wang Xiaozhen, Chen Jicheng, Shen Tianxin, and Lin Kanghou. During the reception, Wang Xiaolai described the flood situation and requested performances from the flower world to benefit the charity event.

<p>Fundraising Entertainment: Announcement to Compatriots</p>
<p>The association is holding a fundraising variety show for flood relief and has issued an announcement to all circles in Shanghai. Since the beginning of this summer, heavy rains have been rampant, and floods have caused disasters. The Yangtze River overflowed first, and the Yellow River breached its banks later. Other major tributaries were also in emergency situations simultaneously. The severity of the disasters is unprecedented. According to reports from various sources, the disaster area covers more than ten provinces, including Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Shandong, Henan, Hebei, and Shaanxi. Wherever the floodwaters reached, people and animals were swept away, and houses were destroyed. The number of people unfortunately buried in the bellies of fish is no less than hundreds of thousands, and the number of displaced victims is even more incalculable. Truly, wails of grief echo everywhere, and the sights are too tragic to bear and the sounds too unbearable to hear. Now that the hot summer has just passed and the cool autumn is coming, those poor victims are wandering with nowhere to go, without food when hungry and without clothing when cold. Farmland has been flooded, and houses are like ruins. The need for help is as urgent as a military fire. We, colleagues, mindful of the deep ties of kinship among compatriots, cannot bear to sit idly by. Hence, the Shanghai All-Circles Fundraising Variety Show for Flood Relief was initiated. Since the preparations began, we have been deeply grateful for the support from all circles and have been actively proceeding. We are now ready for the opening of the show and wish to share our thoughts with all our compatriots in Shanghai. Shanghai's cosmopolitan area stretches for ten miles, with bright lights and lavish spending in abundance. Although it has been affected by international monetary policies in recent years and financial difficulties are gradually emerging, judging by the crowded conditions in various entertainment venues and the congested entrances and exits of theaters, it is clear that our Shanghai compatriots are not completely incapable of saving the victims. Furthermore, the countryside is the foundation of the city. If the countryside goes bankrupt, the city will lose its foundation. Now, the vast countryside is under severe disaster and cannot recover. Raising funds for relief and promoting its restoration will directly save the victims and indirectly save ourselves. Only with the countryside can the prosperity of the city be summoned. Alas, compatriots, the national crisis is deep, and the disasters are severe. National subjugation and racial extinction are imminent. If we do not save ourselves, who will save us? The poorer the society and the more dangerous the country, the more we should demonstrate the spirit of mutual assistance and self-reliance among the Chinese people. Today's Chinese people, whether in the city or in the countryside, are about to fall into an unpredictable fate. Since their situations are the same, they should comfort each other and support each other. If we do not take this path, we will only accelerate the collapse and demise of our nation. The association's appeal to all circles is only to earnestly seek universal mobilization for fundraising, not to expect all Shanghai compatriots to come to the association to enjoy the variety show. However, those who enjoy the variety show are certainly welcome to come and support this righteous cause, as they can relieve their minds and bodies through entertainment and benefit the victims at the same time, truly achieving two good things with one action. This urgent plea is presented with the hope that it will be appreciated.</p>

<h3 id="e123">Pinzhen Jewelry Store Suspected of Tax Evasion: Customs Requests Search, Confiscates Expensive Diamond Jewelry <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Pinzhen Jewelry Store at 639 Nanjing Road is best known for its low-profit sales, leading to a not-bad business. However, the Jianghai Customs Service recently discovered that the goods sold by the store were suspected of tax evasion. It sent a letter to the Legal Department of the Public Works Bureau requesting assistance in investigating and banning the business. The department then requested the First Special District Court to issue search warrant No. 12. At 3:55 PM the day before yesterday, Chinese detective Liang Laisheng and Western patrol chief Deng Gen, together with representatives from the Customs Service, rushed to search the store. They confiscated 215 diamond rings, 23 diamond-set gemstone rings, 16 diamond-set sapphire rings, 13 pairs of diamond earrings, 6 pairs of gemstone earrings, 2 pairs of black gemstone earrings, 11 gemstone brooches, 14 gemstone bracelets, 8 bracelets, 4 sapphire bracelets (all of the above are inlaid with diamonds), 15 bags of small loose diamonds, totaling 1,643 diamonds, and 11 account books, with a total value of 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. At the time, the items were placed in a leather suitcase, and Pinzhen manager Dong Shuyu, Western patrol chief Deng Gen, and Customs Service representative Pu Si each signed and sealed the box before taking it back to the Laozha police station. Yesterday morning, the items were sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police station lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated that, according to the Customs Service's report, Pinzhen Jewelry Store was suspected of violating Article 21 of the Anti-Smuggling Regulations. Therefore, the police station requested a search warrant from the court to conduct the search. At the time, the store manager could not provide invoices or other proof of purchase. It is now requested that the confiscated items be temporarily detained at the police station, while the 11 account books be handed over to the Customs Service personnel for investigation. Customs Service representative Pu Si testified that the diamonds sold by Pinzhen did not match the Customs Service's records, so they were considered to be suspected of tax evasion. Pinzhen manager Dong Shuyu stated that the diamonds purchased by the store were mostly traded in cash on the market according to industry practice and did not have invoices, and were not purchased from overseas. He also hired lawyer Fan Gang to appear in court and requested that the Customs Service provide sufficient evidence to prove that Pinzhen's goods were tax-evaded. After Magistrate Zhan Liangce reported the matter, it was ordered that the confiscated items be detained until next Tuesday for further review, and the 11 account books be handed over to the Customs Service personnel for immediate investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Confiscated Diamonds Returned: Three Englishmen Accused of Tax Evasion for Lack of Evidence <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>According to the Great American Evening News, on June 24th of this year, Shanghai Customs officials, together with officers from the Public Works Department, investigated the China Diamond Cutting Company and discovered diamonds worth 300,000 taels. They were suspected to be smuggled goods, and the British Consulate General accused three Englishmen, including a Mr. Grigori, of evading taxes and importing a large quantity of diamonds. After several trials by the police court, the case was dismissed due to insufficient evidence. Because one of the defendants, Mr. E. Beckenham, had already gone to Manila, the diamonds were temporarily stored in the police court's warehouse. Now that Mr. Beckenham has returned to Shanghai, the diamonds have been returned to their original owner by the police court.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Garment Makers' Guild: Water Festival Leads to Disaster; Steamboat Collides with Festival Boat; Wang Amao Tragically Perishes <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The local Shanghai North City garment makers' guild recently collected funds to hold a water and land Taoist ceremony for three days. The day before yesterday (the 11th) was the last day. They hired a Xin Zhen Chang steamboat to tow two pier boats behind (the two boats were side by side). The boats were fully loaded with ingots, paper clothes, a large number, and carried six monks chanting Buddhist scriptures. The sound of drums and gongs was deafening, and many members of the guild were on the boats burning ingots and paper clothes, all extremely excited. Unexpectedly, joy turned to sorrow. The Xin Zhen Chang steamboat was sailing from south to north. Near Yangshupu, a Zhang Jia Bang (boat name) steamboat was sailing from Pudong to Puxi. Because it was too late to avoid the collision, it violently crashed into the pier boat being towed by Xin Zhen Chang. Wang Amao (20 years old, local resident of Huade Road), a garment maker squatting at the bow of the boat burning paper money, and two others were knocked into the river. Two people were rescued immediately, but Wang Amao had already joined the water ghosts, with no trace of his body. This greatly dampened the spirits and led to a dispirited end to the celebration. It was not until 7 a.m. yesterday that the water police patrol boat finally recovered Wang Amao's body, taking it to the Lifesaving Bureau at the South Wharf. The patrol head sent detectives Yao Guofa and Xu Juelu to inform the deceased's father, Wang Jinsheng, to apply to the local court for an autopsy. After an interrogation by Inspector Zhao Chuanjia, he went to the Lifesaving Bureau on the Bund to verify the cause of death. Observers said the deceased's father hastily prepared a coffin to await further instructions.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Pingxin Steamboat Capsizes Rowboat: Drowning Incident; Passengers Suffer Great Losses; Steamboat Captain Detained for Investigation <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The Pingxin steamboat of the Hu Nan-Min Nan Company, which travels to and from Pinghu and other places, is docked at the Guan Dock in Nanshi. On the afternoon of the 11th of this month, at 6:30 PM, the steamboat returned from Pinghu to Shanghai. While passing the Jianghai Customs South Checkpoint (near the Shenjia Garden, known as the Yucheng Foreign Customs), it stopped the engine for customs inspection as usual. Passengers Huang Zhuqi, Huang Xiangzhao, Xu Yougen, Fu Tingzhang, and two others intended to disembark at the pier nearby. They hired a rowboat operated by the Shandong siblings Sun Shannv (21 years old) and Sun Xiaoyatou (16 years old) to ferry them ashore. Sun Shannv and her sister tied the rowboat to the steamboat. Sun Shannv was at the stern of the rowboat holding onto the steamboat's iron bar, while Sun Xiaoyatou was at the bow of the rowboat holding onto the steamboat, so that passengers could cross. Huang Zhuqi and the others had already crossed to the rowboat and Fu Tingzhang was in the process of crossing when the steamboat unexpectedly rang the bell and started to move. So, Fu retreated back to the steamboat. At that time, the tide was rapid, and as the steamboat turned, the rowboat could not withstand the force and immediately capsized. Everyone on board fell into the water. Except for the passengers Huang Zhuqi and the other four, and Sun Xiaoyatou, who were rescued on the spot, Sun Shannv was drowned. The water police arrested the steamboat captain, Wang Ahai (51 years old, from Changshu), who caused the accident, and detained him in the police station. Sun Shannv's body was recovered from the river at the South Wharf at 2:45 PM the day before yesterday (the 12th) and taken to the Lifesaving Bureau to await an autopsy. Yesterday morning, the water police summoned witnesses Huang Zhuqi, Huang Xiangzhao, Xu Yougen, and the deceased's father, Sun Xiaomao (52 years old, from Shandong, who usually relied on his children to operate the boat for a living), for questioning. They prepared a document and sent detective Cheng Yongnian to escort Wang Ahai, the captain of the Min Nan steamboat, who was suspected of negligence, and the witnesses to the local court for interrogation and to request an autopsy. After being interrogated by Inspector Zhao Chuanjia, he ordered Wang Ahai to be detained. He then led Inspector Xuan Zhiming to the Lifesaving Bureau on the Bund, where they verified that Sun Shannv had indeed drowned. A report was filled out instructing the deceased's father, Sun Xiaomao, to prepare a coffin and await further instructions. It is reported that the luggage and baskets carried by the five passengers who fell into the water were all washed away, resulting in a total loss of over a thousand taels of silver.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Feud Over Money: Good Friends Turn on Each Other; Feng Muqing Chopped but Not Lightly Wounded; Qian Shanhai Suddenly Changes His Testimony <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Qian Shanhai, 28 years old, from Longhua in the western suburbs of this county, and Feng Muqing, 30 years old, a local resident living at No. 130, Liu Jia Nong, Maiqi Road, Rue de Brenas, French Concession, both swore allegiance to the renowned gangster brothers, Mr. Gu, as their "old man." Therefore, Qian and Feng were nominally sworn brothers. Previously, they jointly invested capital to manufacture fake banknotes, which Feng embezzled, leading to a deep-seated feud. Unable to vent his anger, Qian gathered Zhou Fugeng, Wang Laoer, Afu, Xuan Gen, and five or six others who are currently at large at around 6 a.m. on June 18th of this year. Armed with axes, they rushed to Feng's home. When the servant woman opened the door to take out the chamber pot, Qian and the others rushed inside and into Feng's bedroom. At that time, Feng was still fast asleep in bed. Qian and the others, without asking any questions, dragged Feng out of bed and chopped at his legs with thirteen axe blows, leaving behind a threatening letter (saying that this attack was just a warning, and that if they reported it to the police, they would surely be killed). Afterwards, Feng did not report to the police but went to the Red Cross General Hospital for treatment. Time passed, but on the 14th of last month, Feng received another threatening letter in the hospital. The hospital reported it to the police, and detective Zhi Zhenglong went to the hospital to investigate Feng's past injuries. On the morning of the 2nd of this month, at around 1 a.m., the detectives learned that the suspect Qian Shanhai was hiding in Room 12 of the Hai Dong Chun Hotel, No. 15, Yunnan Road, Public Concession. They, along with the Old Zha Police Station, sent detectives to arrest Qian. The next day, he was sent to the Special Second Court. During the interrogation, Qian confessed that because Feng had been harsh and humiliating, he had gathered people to attack him. The court ordered him to be detained and scheduled another hearing. This was reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning at 11 a.m., Judge Zhang Chaozuo of the Special Second Court continued the hearing in the Criminal Division One. Lawyer Yuan Yu of the Police Department stated the results of the police investigation and filed charges of intentional injury under Article 277, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. The victim, Feng Muqing, then testified about the circumstances of the attack, saying that he and the defendant had been friends but had a grudge over money dating back three or four years. When asked, the defendant Qian Shanhai denied his previous testimony, adamantly denying that he had gone to attack the plaintiff and denying any previous difficulties with the plaintiff. The court repeatedly challenged him, but the defendant vehemently protested his innocence and hired lawyers Fan Gang and Fan Shisheng to appear in court to defend him. The court ordered the victim to go to the forensic medical examination for his injuries and ordered that arguments be made. The court then declared the hearing closed and scheduled sentencing. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<p>Xie Zhenxuan, 26 years old, from Zhenhai, who previously worked at the Ximen branch of the Shanghai Bank and currently resides at No. 226, London Road, Xibao Xing Road, Zhabei, married Chen Yueying (22 years old), also from Zhenhai. Recently, due to disagreements, their relationship deteriorated. Chen Yueying hired a lawyer and filed a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court, accusing her husband, Xie Zhenxuan, of obstructing her freedom and coercing her to sign a divorce agreement. She claimed that they had been married for six or seven years and that since returning to their hometown four months ago on February 17th, he had not provided her with a single penny for living expenses. Therefore, she came to Shanghai to reason with him. She first stayed at her aunt's house and then rented a place at No. 49, Qing An Lane, Tang Jia Wan. On June 9th, at 6 p.m., the defendant suddenly called me to the upper floor of the Shanghai Bank Ximen branch and forced me to sign a separation agreement. When I returned home and had someone read it, it turned out to be a divorce agreement. She immediately hired a lawyer to negotiate for the return of the agreement, but the defendant ignored her. She requested an investigation. First, Judge Sun Pengxian of the Special Second Court opened a hearing and summoned the parties. Because of jurisdictional errors, it was ruled to be transferred to the local court for trial. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiong Huiping of the Special Second Court opened a hearing in Criminal Division Two and summoned both parties and their lawyers. The plaintiff, Chen Yueying, first testified about how she was forced by her husband to sign the divorce agreement. The defendant, Xie Zhenxuan, testified that he was ill and, on the advice of his doctor, signed a separation agreement with his wife, not a divorce agreement. He stated that all the documents were in the plaintiff's possession. After reviewing the testimony, the court stated that since the parties were still formally married and not divorced, it was ruled that, according to Article 326 of the Criminal Procedure Law, husband and wife could not sue each other. The plaintiff should file a complaint with the police station. After the ruling, the court adjourned. After exiting the courtroom, the plaintiff, Chen Yueying, waited outside the court for the defendant, Xie Zhenxuan, to leave with his lawyer. She then grabbed Xie and took him to the French police station next to the court to request an investigation. In addition to the obstruction of freedom alleged in the complaint, she also added a charge of abandonment.</p>

<p>Xu Zhihui, 51 years old, from Ningbo, residing at No. 9, Da An Fang, No. 182, Pu En Ji Shi Road, French Concession, had been working as an accountant at Gong Mao Wildlife Shop, Nos. 18 and 20, Caishi Street, for many years. In recent years, he had accumulated debts of thousands of taels of silver due to the marriage of his children. Recently, due to urgent demands from creditors, he was unable to make ends meet, leading him to take his own life. On the afternoon of the 12th, he returned home from the shop at 4 p.m. After having dinner at 6 p.m., he went to bed at 8 p.m. At 2 a.m., he got up while his wife, children, and daughters-in-law were asleep and swallowed Lysol disinfectant to commit suicide. He groaned incessantly after poisoning himself. His wife, Ms. Hu, discovered this when she noticed an empty bottle of Lysol on the table in front of the bed. She immediately hired a car to take him to Guangci Hospital. However, the poisoning was too severe, and treatment was ineffective. He died about half an hour after being admitted to the hospital, at 3 a.m. The hospital reported the incident to the Zhaojiawan Central Police Station as per regulations. Detectives were sent to investigate the cause of the suicide. The body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch morgue for an autopsy. Yesterday morning, the police summoned the deceased's wife, Xu Hu, and Xu Zhongxing, to the police station. They reported to the Special Second Court and requested Inspector Wang Ren to come to the morgue with forensic doctor Wei and clerk Peng Shujiguan at noon. They confirmed that Xu Zhihui had died by poisoning himself before death. After taking his seat, detective Zhang Chunsheng reported on the investigation. The officer questioned the deceased's wife. He then ordered the body to be released to the family for burial after they had signed a guarantee.</p>

<p>Yesterday (the 13th) afternoon at around 3 p.m., one hour before the departure of the 302nd Shanghai-Ping train on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway at the North Shanghai Station, as passengers were boarding the train, Zhang Baoren, the section chief of the railway police section, and detective Chen Rongnian, were patrolling the platform. They saw three or four passengers carrying hand luggage hurriedly boarding the train, acting suspiciously. Zhang and Chen immediately followed them onto the train. When questioning them, they were evasive. The three passengers and a rattan bag, two small leather bags were detained. They were taken to the office of the 3rd Railway Police Division.

<p>Hu Xuan Ting, 47, a Cantonese man, formerly worked for the China Motor Company, and lived with his wife, Hu Liao, 28, at 30 Jiaotong Lane, Qiujiang Road, Shanghai. On the evening of October 25, 1932, Jiang Mao, who lived with the couple, was ill in bed. As her four-year-old daughter, Xiaozhuzi, lacked care, she asked Hu Liao to stay with the child. Hu Xuan Ting returned home from work around 11 pm that night. When he saw the little girl in bed, he asked about the situation and instructed his wife to cover her well and keep her from catching a cold, before going to bed. The next morning, Xiaozhuzi got up and went home. The following day, Jiang Mao saw that Xiaozhuzi was urinating blood. Suspecting that Hu Xuan Ting had raped the girl, she accused Hu Xuan Ting of raping a young girl and Hu Liao of assisting in the rape at the Shanghai District Court. Several days later, Xiaozhuzi died from her illness. Jiang Mao then accused the Hu couple of raping the girl and causing her death. In the first trial, Hu Xuan Ting was sentenced to life imprisonment, and Hu Liao was sentenced to 13 years' imprisonment. The Hu couple appealed to the High Court, which overturned the verdict and declared them innocent. The prosecutor appealed to the Supreme Court, which ordered a retrial. Hu was still convicted according to the first trial, while Hu Liao's sentence was reduced to 12 years. The Hu couple again appealed to the Supreme Court. In May of this year, another retrial was ordered. The Guangdong compatriots in Shanghai felt injustice and jointly requested the Guangdong Shanghai Association to provide legal assistance. The Association, considering that the case involved a fellow townsman being falsely accused, appointed Guo Qiming, a lawyer and director of the Association, to go to Jiangsu to provide pro bono defense. The case was announced on the 2nd of this month, and the Hu couple were found not guilty. The three years of injustice have finally been redressed. The couple have praised the virtue of lawyer Guo Qiiming.</p>

<p>Sending Bigu Pills to Disaster Areas for Relief</p>
<p>Zhao Daozhang of the Daozi Relief Association in this city received a telegram from the Daozi Relief Association in Jining, Shandong, stating that the area had suffered severe flooding this summer, and the famine victims were desperately in need of food. Zhao Daozhang personally went to Xu Chongdao Pharmacy on Avenue Edward VII (愛文義路) a few days ago and ordered the first batch of over 1,000 catties (斤) of hunger-relief Bigu Xian Dan (辟穀仙丹), totaling more than 50,000 pills, packed into fifteen large boxes. On the afternoon of the 13th, the China Travel Service shipped them to Jining to Officer Wang (王長官) for distribution to the disaster areas. More are being made and will be shipped soon.

Because the previous membership registration had some omissions, a remedial measure was issued. The office has already drafted a re-registration and re-election method and notified all railway workers, setting the period from now until the 24th of this month for re-registration and re-election, so that the reorganization work can be completed before the end of this month and a representative assembly can be convened as soon as possible. The original text of the notice is attached below for your information.</p>
<p>Notice: It has been found that the Executive Committee of the Special Party Department of the Jin-Hu, Hu-Hang-Yong Railway of the Chinese Kuomintang issued instruction Zhi Zi (職字) No. 152, which briefly stated: "The Central People's Movement Guidance Committee issued instruction No. 10398, which briefly stated: "After this committee sent personnel to reorganize the union, and after this committee sent personnel to inspect, it was believed that the union reorganization work on this railway was proceeding purely in accordance with legal procedures in terms of planning. However, in the process of implementation, there were some careless aspects. For example, there were many real workers at each station who had not been registered. It seemed that appropriate remedies should be given." Remedies were drafted and submitted to the committee. The remedial measures were found to be feasible. In addition to a letter to the Ministry of Railways, we have copied one piece of the remedial measure and ordered you to comply with it." Upon receiving this order, we copied and issued the relevant measures and ordered you to comply with them. Upon receiving this order, we checked and found that more than 8,600 members of our office have already been registered in accordance with the law. Unfortunately, a small number of members had a wait-and-see attitude during the last registration and did not register. Now, in compliance with the order, we will carry out a supplementary registration, setting the period from now until the 24th of this month for the supplementary registration. All workers in the car, machine, and engineering sections of this railway who have not yet registered must go to register in accordance with the following supplementary registration and re-election methods and participate in the election. Do not delay. In addition to separately notifying everyone, this is a notice for your information.</p>
<p>Supplementary Registration and Re-election Methods</p>
<p>1. Workers in the car, machine, and engineering sections who have not been registered may directly request registration from the local branch or sub-branch within the above-mentioned time limit.</p>
<p>2. This office will send personnel to join the sub-branch officers to distribute to the stations and sections that have not yet been registered, guiding the registration.</p>
<p>3. Members who are registered in the supplementary registration will still be appropriately divided into groups according to the nature of their work and the work environment.</p>
<p>4. If the number of people registered in a supplementary registration in each group exceeds two-thirds of the original number of people, the group should be re-elected.</p>
<p>5. If more than two-thirds of the groups belonging to each branch are re-elected, the branch should also be re-elected. The same applies if each sub-branch has the same situation.</p>
<p>6. Members registered in the supplementary registration may separately schedule an election of representatives according to the original regulations on the number of people in the representative assembly election groups of the entire railway.</p>

Mr. Xie had sent a special letter requesting leave, expressing his apologies. At the meeting, a statistical report on the work of the Mutual Aid Association in July was submitted for discussion. It was generally felt that the progress of the association's affairs was smooth. The establishment of three new offices (in Nanshi, the French Concession, and Zhabei) was also a very satisfactory start. The association also received the following donations from major businesses: 7,000 paper fans from Dunlop Rubber Company, one set of a six-tube long and short wave radio from the China and West Drug Store, two sets of four-tube long and short wave radios from the Dahua Steel Factory, and 29 packages of medicine from Maoli Western Drug Store. The association has sent special letters of thanks to the above-mentioned businesses. The Special Relief Committee for Rickshaw Pullers Who Have Not Registered and Received Licenses recently held a meeting. At that time, because the scope of the problem had not been determined, it was difficult to determine the procedures to be followed. Therefore, it was decided to convene another meeting in late this month to present a report. In addition, the minutes of the two meetings of the Personnel Committee on the 24th and 30th of last month were also submitted to the Board of Directors for reporting. Apart from slight additions and deletions, they were generally agreed upon and passed. In addition, the Board of Directors also accepted the minutes of the two meetings of the Insurance Committee on the 22nd of last month and the 2nd of this month. The Board of Directors had a detailed discussion on insurance matters. As a result, the following resolutions were passed: (1) All rickshaw pullers who have been registered and licensed will be insured by the Mutual Aid Association, so that they will receive an indemnity of 40 yuan in the event of death or serious accidents. (2) 40,000 yuan will be allocated from the existing funds for the exclusive payment of insurance premiums. In addition, it was decided that if there is a surplus in the above-mentioned insurance plan at the end of the fiscal year, the surplus should be immediately withdrawn and allocated to the rickshaw puller old-age pension fund. The method of handling this subsidy will be determined in the future, but its general intention is to provide a certain amount of donation to rickshaw pullers who, due to old age, disability or other reasons, are unable to work, and to those who have paid mutual assistance fees for a certain period of time, but are unable to continue to enjoy mutual assistance rights due to the cessation of their occupation. The Board of Directors decided to first allocate 10,000 yuan from the funds at the discretion of the Custody Committee as the fundamental fund for old-age pensions. The Board of Directors also decided to request the Custody Committee to allocate 50,000 yuan from the accumulated mutual assistance fees to be used for the relief of unemployed rickshaw pullers and to assist them in returning to their hometowns. All rickshaw pullers who previously worked in the Public Concession but were not registered and licensed, and who were unable to pull rickshaws due to the limitation of the number of people or other reasons, so that they could not register and receive licenses, and were therefore unemployed, may be assisted by the Mutual Aid Association to return to their hometowns or given other relief. Furthermore, at the end of the meeting discussion, the Chairman mentioned that someone was distributing leaflets among the rickshaw pullers that day. The leaflets claimed to be issued by the Mutual Aid Association, but this was not the case. The leaflets stated that the Mutual Aid Association allowed the distribution of a large amount of food, clothing, money, etc., all of which were wishful thinking and unfounded. Their intention was nothing more than to instigate the rickshaw pullers to come to the association to make wanton demands, thereby damaging the reputation of the Mutual Aid Association. The Board of Directors of the Mutual Aid Association unanimously resolved that the means were despicable, and immediately decided to investigate and punish the person who made and distributed the leaflets.</p>

<p>The North China Daily News reports that Mr. Booker, a famous American hunter and wildlife filmmaker, arrived in Shanghai last Saturday night on the mail ship "Nalder". At dawn on Tuesday, he had already departed for New York on the President Coolidge. Mr. Booker spent six months making another wildlife and forest film. He set out from New York on December 7 last year, travelling through Europe to India. He stayed in India for two months and shot several excellent tiger films. He then went to Malaysia and established a public office in Johor, where he received favorable treatment from the local sultan, who provided him with all kinds of assistance. In total, he shot 95,000 feet of film, but only 8,000 feet will be selected for use. The tentative name of the new film is "Fangs". Mr. Booker is now rushing back to the United States to spend two months editing the film and adding scenery and sound. One of the features of the film is the lifestyle of a savage tribe called the Sakais, who live deep in the forests of Malaysia. They are of medium height and originally occupied southern Asia. Today, they are declining and there are not many left. They know nothing about any of the tools of the new era. They still use stone for knives and axes, and their weapons are blowpipes and darts. Their lives are almost like those of wild animals, and they have not yet emerged from the primitive era. However, they are afraid of seeing outsiders. Mr. Booker spent a lot of time approaching them and finally gained their trust, allowing him to live in several villages for some time. Mr. Booker visited Shanghai six years ago. He was very surprised to see the great changes in the city's appearance this time. Mr. Booker may return to the Far East next year, and he still plans to visit Shanghai at that time.</p>

<h3 id="e141">The Weather is Uncooperative, Heavy Rain Pours Down, Charity Tennis Match Rescheduled for Today, Starting at 3:30 PM Still at Singapore Road, Exhibition at Rong Garden Cancelled, Attempting to Retain Xu for a Few Days, Xu Won Four Games in a Row Against Lin Baohua Yesterday <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The charity tennis tournament, originally scheduled to begin at 4:00 PM yesterday at the China Tennis Club on Singapore Road, had already experienced heavy rain yesterday morning. It stopped slightly at noon, so the audience went to Singapore Road continuously, with an estimated number of four or five hundred people. However, the weather was uncooperative. When the competition was about to begin, the rain suddenly intensified, followed by a downpour. Although the singles match between Xu Chengji (許承基) and Lin Baohua (林寶華) began in the rain, Xu Chengji won four games in a row. It was not possible to continue the match, and it was forced to stop. It was decided to postpone it to today, starting at 3:30 PM, still at the China Tennis Club. Tickets of five yuan and three yuan are still valid. Those present yesterday included Mayor Wu's representative Tang Shixuan (唐士煊), initiators Director Wu Xingya (吳醒亞) and his wife, Education Director Pan Gongzhan, Legislator Wu Kaixian (吳開先), and German Consul Kliber (克利伯) stationed in Shanghai. When the rain first came, the audience still stood in the rain, unwilling to leave. It was not until the match was stopped that they dispersed.</p>
<p>Xu Chengji is Unstoppable</p>
<p>Xu and Lin started the match in the rain. Lin served first, but Xu won the first game with a score of "slip four" (滑四). Then, when Xu served, Lin only managed to win one point. Xu's serves and corner shots left Lin Baohua at a loss and with no way to defend himself. Thus, in one breath, Xu Chengji won four games in a row, taking a 4-0 lead. The match lasted less than ten minutes. At this point, due to the heavy rain, the match was announced to be stopped. Xu and Lin will continue the match this afternoon. The schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Xu Chengji vs. Lin Baohua, starting at 3:30 PM, singles (Xu leads 4-0)</p>
<p>(2) Qiu Feihai (邱飛海) vs. Carlson, 4:15 PM, singles</p>
<p>(3) Xu Chengji and Lin Baohua vs. Carlson and Defu (德孚), 5:00 PM, doubles</p>
<p>Trying to Retain Xu Chengji</p>
<p>Xu was originally scheduled to perform at Rong Garden today, but it had to be cancelled due to the postponement of the charity event. Xu is scheduled to leave Shanghai tomorrow to return south, so Chen Qihao (陳其浩), Tan Jing (潭敬), and other enthusiastic tennis fans are discussing with Xu to stay in Shanghai for a few more days. If Mr. Xu's schedule is a concern, they plan to send Mr. Xu to Hong Kong by plane and then take a boat to Singapore. Mr. Xu has indicated his willingness to agree. If it does not rain again, there may be an opportunity to perform at Rong Garden.</p>

<p>The Tianjin National Army 35th Army polo team was originally scheduled to come to Shanghai for competition in the near future. However, according to Song Xiaofeng (宋曉峯), the Chinese manager of the Public Bus Company and a polo expert in this city, the horses used for polo must be trained. More than ten horses are needed for competition. Few Chinese people in Shanghai raise such horses. Although Westerners have them, they are not willing to lend them easily. Therefore, horses have become a problem. If they are transported from Tianjin, the freight for fourteen or fifteen horses would be very high. Therefore, it will not be possible to make the trip.</p>

<p>(Xiamen Correspondence) The Xiamen YMCA held its 5th Annual Gulangyu-Xiamen Cross-Harbor Swimming Competition on August 3rd. That morning, General Secretary of the YMCA, Shen Zhizhong, and Sports Secretary, Lu Dalun, arrived at the starting and ending points between Gulangyu and Xiamen to survey and prepare everything. After 2 PM, spectators lined both shores, with an especially large number of boats on the water, totaling no less than three thousand people. The Water Police First Brigade and the Public Security Third Bureau were responsible for water and land traffic control. The directors, staff, and officers of the YMCA, including Zhang Shixiong, Ma Zongse, Ding Yuehan (Inspection Division), Yang Xubao, Du Shenyuan (Timing Division), Zhuang Jifu, Lin Xiuwu, Lin Zongjing, Zhuang Yagu (Record Division), Rong Zihua, Wen Yao (Finish Line Judging Division), Ke Fuliang, Du Zunen (Rescue Division), and Zhang Yuantong (Photography Division), arrived at the venue one after another. At 2:15 PM, the starter, Lu Dalun, called the roll, and seventy-six people reported. Due to the rising tide, the start was moved up to 2:40 PM. At the sound of the starter's gun, seventy-five male and female athletes entered the water. Because there were too many spectator boats, some difficulties arose in traffic control. Fortunately, the water police patrol boats maintained order effectively, and the competitors were able to pass smoothly and reach the finish line. Chen Shulin of Jimei won the championship with a time of ten minutes and forty-eight seconds amidst cheers. (Wang Honglong had won the third and fourth competitions; his fourth competition record was ten minutes, eight seconds, and seven-tenths of a second). A total of sixty-one people finished after him (fifty-one men, forty-one finished; six women, five finished; nineteen children, fifteen finished). Because the waves were extremely strong, some drifted to the Xiamen Port area. These were guided and escorted ashore by the YMCA authorities and the water police patrol boats. Although the results were approximately forty seconds slower than last year due to the post-typhoon conditions and strong waves, public opinion was highly satisfied with these results considering the water's resistance. The names of the winners are listed below:</p>
<p>(Men's Division) Champion: Chen Shulin (time: ten minutes and forty-eight seconds), (2) Fu Zonglin, (3) Lin Huitian, (4) Hong Anxun, (5) Cai Lianlu, (6) Wang Honglong (last year's champion), (7) Zhang Hongsheng, (8) Guo Jie.</p>
<p>(Women's Division) Champion: Han Meili (time: twenty-six minutes and fifty-two seconds), (2) Shi Huizhi (last year's runner-up), (3) Yang Mali (last year's champion). (Children's Division) Champion: Guo Keming (time: seventeen minutes and fifty-two seconds, a remarkable 13th place overall), (2) Zhuang Mingzhi, (3) Li Da.</p>

<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th) Based on inspection reports, the Ministry of Education issued an order on the 13th to National Wuhan University, Hubei Provincial Education College, Private Wuchang China University, and Huazhong University to earnestly improve their school affairs in accordance with the points listed in the order.</p>
<p>National Wuhan University (Beijing News) The Ministry of Education issued an order to Wuhan's public and private universities on the 13th to earnestly improve various aspects, the order is as follows: (1) The order to National Wuhan University states, "The Ministry has previously provided key points and ordered improvements. After reviewing the inspectors' reports, the university has conscientiously implemented the points suggested by the Ministry's order. Furthermore, efforts have been made in rationalizing the allocation of funds, expanding facilities, and improving teaching and examinations. However, the following points still need attention and compliance, to be reported for record: (1) The university's College of Agriculture is already established, and new students or short-term training courses should be enrolled in the coming year based on the faculty and facilities. Efforts should still be actively devoted to expanding and improving the facilities. (2) The university should find ways to enhance the teaching and research work of the Colleges of Science and Engineering. Professors should take more responsibility for guiding the science students' practical work and not completely delegate it to teaching assistants. The College of Engineering needs to recruit talented faculty to meet the needs of the college's development. (3) Student dormitories and clothing should be kept clean and tidy, and sloppiness should not be tolerated. The university's adoption of a mentor-like system for freshmen is very beneficial and should be implemented with care to maximize its effectiveness.</p>
<p>Hubei Provincial Education College (2) The order to Hubei Provincial Education College states, "The Ministry has previously provided key points and urged improvements. After reviewing the inspectors' reports, the college has only ordered the planning and implementation of vocational schools in the agricultural sciences, with little other improvement. The key points are re-emphasized below: (1) The college's curriculum should be practical, reducing education courses and increasing agricultural courses, with a particular emphasis on agricultural technology training. (2) Practice fields and equipment must be expanded. (3) Excellent faculty must be carefully selected for agriculture and other basic courses to improve teaching efficiency.

The Department of Chemistry and the Applied Chemistry Department of the high school have also emphasized research and experimentation. However, the Dongshan campus has not been built, the foundation has not been further raised, and although books and instruments have been slightly added, the foundation is too poor and still insufficient. The number of staff is excessive, with office expenses accounting for 28%, which is considered excessive. Teachers lack specialization in the subjects they teach and often hold concurrent positions outside the university. The admission standards for new students are too lax, etc. After reviewing the reports, the university has made little improvement on the points suggested by the Ministry's orders in the past year. This year, all departments and courses except for Chemistry, Chinese Literature, Education, and Business Administration should suspend enrollment. The university should still follow the points below to vigorously rectify the situation, to observe future effects, and report the rectification situation in detail: (1) Start the construction of the new campus as soon as possible. (2) Actively raise foundation funds, with at least a considerable amount within the year. (3) Reduce office expenses and enrich the content of equipment. (4) Select and hire excellent and qualified full-time teachers, and strictly limit their concurrent teaching positions outside the university. (5) Raise the standards for admitting new students and strictly conduct entrance examinations."</p>
<p>Huazhong University (4) The order to Private Wuchang Huazhong University states, "The Ministry has previously provided key points and ordered improvements. After reviewing the inspection reports, the university has conscientiously implemented the points suggested by the Ministry's order. However, excellent faculty should be hired to teach courses such as Chinese Literature, Economics, Commerce, History, and Society. You are hereby ordered to comply with and improve."</p>

The Ministry's specific replies to the Shandong Education Department and the Shanghai Education Bureau regarding this matter are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) The Ministry of Education, in response to a telegram from He Siyuan of the Shandong Education Department, stated that Article 4, (2), Item 1 of the regulations for qualifying secondary school teachers, "Does the specialist course refer specifically to the advanced normal school specialist course or also to the university specialist course?

Please advise." The Ministry of Education explained, "Article 4, (2), Item 2 of the provisional regulations for qualifying teachers in secondary and normal schools refers specifically to the advanced normal school specialist course. There is no difference in the qualification for certification between the two-year and three-year advanced normal school specialist courses, and the specialist course is equivalent to a specialist school.

<h3 id="e159">Mr. Jin Zongcheng's Contribution to This Year's Students Studying Abroad <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Jin Zongcheng published the following article yesterday, "A Humble Contribution to the Students Studying Abroad": In today's China, with its backward industry, declining commerce, and bankrupt rural areas, the atmosphere of recession pervades the globe, and it is especially severe in our country. Some commentators say that the key to recovery lies in the self-awareness and striving of the Chinese people. However, I place even greater hope in the students studying abroad. In recent years, every August and September, a large group of students has gone to study in various countries in Europe and America. This is because science has advanced rapidly in modern Europe and America, and everything is governed by scientific methods, leading to their prosperity today. You are going to study their applied sciences and contribute them to the nation and society after you have completed your studies, so that the country becomes strong. The mission you bear is heavy and great. As the ancient sage said, "When Heaven is about to place a great responsibility on someone, it first afflicts their mind, exhausts their muscles, and starves their body." This time, you students studying abroad will travel across the ocean. At best, it can enhance the international standing; at worst, it will study industry and commerce. The mission you bear is heavy and great. This is the beginning of shouldering great responsibility in the future. Although you have resources, you do not need to exhaust your muscles or starve your body. But if you want to study the practical knowledge of those countries and how they have prospered, you must suffer your mind. If your heart is not firm and your will is not strong, you will not succeed. If you are not dedicated, you will not learn anything essential, and you will not be able to use it unless you do practical work on the ground to learn how to implement the technology. You are all well-educated scholars in China, so there is no need for my superfluous words. However, I have read the Customs reports, and the amount of our country's annual trade deficit is alarming. Although this is the result of commercial competition among various countries, it is also a reflection of the Chinese people's fondness for foreign goods and their disregard for domestic goods. You students studying abroad, whether in commerce or industry, should follow your inclinations and study the reasons for our country's alarming trade deficit, why foreign goods are sold in our country, and why Chinese people despise domestic goods, in addition to your academic studies. You must research the root cause and prepare for future reforms. In a few years, when you return home and dedicate yourselves to society, all aspects of our country that are insufficient to compete with others will rely on you to use your knowledge to build the foundation, or transform it to serve those who could not study abroad. Therefore, you are going abroad to study today, and you will be the masters of transforming China in the future. Your responsibility is heavy and great, and the people of the country have high expectations for you. I dare to offer my sincere words and ask you to work hard for the motherland.</p>

<p>In that bathroom, there were two large basins, as well as foot basins, spray tubes, and various washing facilities. Ned was soon immersed in another basin, the water was warm and comfortable! At the same time, he watched two women wipe four or five small children clean, put them in white, clean pajamas, and then they curled up in bed. As for the few children, they wanted to play many tricks at the same time, making everyone seem to be caught in a whirlwind of laughter until they were suffocated in their beds.</p>
<p>Ned washed his body, wrapped himself well in a blanket, and sat next to the stove. Nasui cut his hair for him, and then another group of children came and were locked in the bathroom. Only the sound of splashing water could be heard inside, like a group of little whales playing.</p>
<p>"Ned should still lie here. This way, when he coughs at night, you can give him a lot of sesame seed juice to drink," said Madam Pei. She ran around, like a hen busy taking care of a large group of restless chicks.</p>
<p>Nasui agreed with the plan, immediately put Ned in a flannel pajama, gave him some warm and sweet things to drink, and then wrapped him in one of the two beds in the room. He lay in bed, like a serene and full mummy, feeling that he had enjoyed all the happiness in the world. Cleanliness itself is a fresh and pleasant feeling; in his world, flannel pajamas had never been heard of; a few comforting words moisturized his desolate heart; a few sips of "good stuff" calmed his cough, the pleasure was the same; and the feeling of being cared for made the simple room look like a paradise to the homeless child. This was like a sweet dream. He closed his eyes repeatedly to test whether this situation would disappear after opening them. Since it proved that this was not an illusion, the joy made it even more difficult for him to fall asleep, even if he tried to fall asleep, it was still impossible, because in these few minutes, a strange system of Plum Village was presented to his astonished but appreciative eyes.</p>

<h3 id="e167">Yellow Millet Dream and Wanghua Fort <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Shouchang</p>
<p>Old classmate Huang Xinyi is recently in Handan. Because of the story of the Yellow Millet Dream, which originated in that county, I sent a letter asking him to inquire about the origin of this matter nearby. Yesterday, I received a letter from him, describing it in detail, which I transcribe below to inform readers. The following is all what Mr. Huang said:</p>
<p>Huangliangmeng is a town in Handan County, Hebei. It was originally named Wanghua Fort. It is famous for Li Bi's "Pillow Book," which describes Lu Sheng's Yellow Millet Dream. Over time, the true name was hidden. Today, most people call the town Huangliangmeng directly and no longer know the old name, except that the Pinghan Railway passes through here and sets up a station, still named Wanghua Fort. According to what is recorded in the Pillow Book, it roughly says: "There was a Lu Sheng who was keen on wealth and honor, and had not made a name for himself even in his prime. He was very depressed. One day, he met Old Man Lu at an inn. The old man was cooking yellow millet and gave Lu Sheng a pillow, saying, 'Pillow on this and you will be able to get what you want.' Lu Sheng received the pillow, and soon dreamed of passing the imperial examination, marrying a daughter of the Cui family of Boling, whose daughter was very beautiful. From then on, his career became prominent, and he served as a general and prime minister for decades, with mansions connected to the clouds, enjoying the pleasures of life to the fullest, unaware that he was in a dream. By one night, he died of old age and illness, and his dream suddenly woke up. He saw Old Man Lu was beside him, and the yellow millet he was cooking was not yet cooked." As for whether this record is a fact or an allegory, I am not a person in the dream, so I dare not make a dogmatic judgment. However, just from the wonderful intention of this article and the depth of its touching people, it is not necessary for there to be a true immortal or a true dream. The author is already endowed with immortal bones. Pu Liuxian wrote "Continuation of the Yellow Millet Dream" in "Liaozhai," venting his anger for a while. The depiction is extremely detailed, but it becomes a dog's tail. This spring, I happened to travel to Handan and had the good fortune to visit this scenic spot. The town is twelve miles away from the city. The ruins of that year have now been built as the Lu Weng Temple, with the gate facing the Yanzhao thoroughfare. The plaque on the temple reads "Handan Ancient Temple." Inside the gate, there is a high wall with stone carvings embedded in it, with the four characters "Fairyland on Penglai" written in large characters. The strokes are agile and seem to fly and come alive. It is said to be the immortal's brush. Further in is the main hall, where a statue of Lu Xian is enshrined in the middle, dressed in Confucian robes and carrying a sword, with a chic and unrestrained air, no less than the demeanor of a scholar. Looking at it, one cannot help but feel leisurely, making people want to transcend the world. In front of the main hall, turn left to another courtyard, with ten acres of ponds, winding bridges and blue railings, pavilions and towers, quiet and secluded, quite worth a visit. Near the pool, there is another high-built hall, where a statue of Han Zhongli is enshrined in the middle, with a huge belly and staring eyes, not only without any immortal energy, but directly close to the demonic path. The Taoist priest told me: "Mr. Zhongli is the teacher of Lu Xian, so he is enshrined together." I said: "Since you enshrine the teacher of Lu Xian here, you should also enshrine the disciple of Lu Xian. I know that Lu Xian has a high disciple, a willow tree spirit. Why is he absent today, not allowing him to be compared to the four配十哲 of Xuan Ni, which is unfair." The Taoist priests all laughed. Behind this hall is the Lu Sheng Temple, said to be the place where yellow millet was cooked in the inn that year. Now a sleeping statue of Lu Sheng is enshrined inside. The statue is carved from a whole block of huge stone, connected to the base, as large as a human body, wearing a Confucian scarf and robes, supporting one arm with a pillow and sleeping, and still not awake. Judging from its stone carvings, it is exquisite and not cleverly woven, probably relics of the Song and Jin dynasties. All those who come here to pay tribute to this sleeping statue cannot help but stroke and feel emotional, lingering and unwilling to leave. Over the years, the statue has become dark and smooth, and the light can reflect people. There are very few steles in Handan, but this temple alone has many stone carvings, all of which are poems by famous people of past dynasties, embedded all over the walls, with almost no gaps. Reading them, there are many famous lines. Because their feelings are so deep, their words are often filled with deep feelings. The scenery moves people, to such an extent that I have been busy in the world for a long time and have abandoned chanting. Here, I also feel something, and poetic meaning arises spontaneously. On the way back, I got a seven-character quatrain: "Cooking cooked yellow millet has been allowed for a long time, I come to borrow a pillow, I am afraid it is too late, I know I do not have the blessings of gods, dare to raise a glass to Mr. Zhizhi." It is said that Lu Xian once got drunk in Yueyang, and I also have the same habit. As for the so-called yellow millet, it is the millet of today. To this day, the residents of Handan still use this to cook rice, and the rice is yellow, so it is called yellow millet."</p>

<p>"One monk carries water to eat, two monks carry water together, and three monks have no water to eat"; this describes the lazy habits of dependent people. The more people there are, the lower the work efficiency is. In fact, this refers to employees who are paid monthly. If the amount of water carried is used as the standard for obtaining compensation, everyone will have a heart to move upwards; the water carrier is a kind of labor, which is no less than iron making, rowing boats, and grinding tofu, which are considered the most hard work by everyone in ancient and modern China; iron making, rowing boats, and grinding tofu are operations that take place day and night, and carrying water is a pore of sweat beads, just like half a catty versus eight taels; there is tap water in the city, so you don’t need this hard work. In small cities in the interior, stove houses and bathhouses are their major customers, and every household cannot do without their traces. They are afraid of continuous rain, and everyone stores "sky water", and they are in danger of starving! Every year, I look forward to a "warm water field" because with drinking water, you also need water. This summer's "warm water field" is their golden age; residents close to the public river sell two copper plates for a burden of water, but the water in the city is precious. The porters don’t have such long shoulder strength. Carrying two buckets of water will spill half a bucket, so the people in the city are water pushers: Seeing that there is a jade belt river, it’s just like the restaurants Lou Wai Lou and Tian Wai Tian on West Lake, just deceiving people. Self-flowing wells are not available to every household, so water carriers have become a specialized profession: "Xiao Dazi", the water carrier on our street, is known to everyone. He is from Taiping Hall, Yangzhou County. His voice is particularly clear and crisp. Everyone laughs when they see him and says: "Xiao Dazi", sing one. He doesn't put on airs, and hums along. He has read the Thousand Character Classic and can sing the seven-character couplets of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai. He is afraid that someone will mistakenly change his water bucket, so he wrote six large characters "Xiao Dazi" "Xiao Dazi" on both sides of the bucket. This seems to be his invincible trademark; he eats thousands of meals, uses hundreds of dollars, and is naked in the spring, summer and autumn. He occasionally wears a white short shirt and pants and old cloth shoes and socks that are washed in Hunan, and he loses his true face. Naughty children, when they see him, find fun and say: Xiao Dazi, are you a groom!</p>

<p>The sun rose higher and higher, and the light gradually became stronger, and everything on the lake was revealed by the sunlight.</p>
<p>Now we can see the pink stamens in those lotus flowers! - But at this time they have not yet fully opened, and still retain the original color of the buds. They seem to be waiting for something, just revealing the fragrance to the fullest, and still unwilling to fully reveal their appearance.</p>
<p>"Ah! What an interesting and wonderful scene!" The Old Buddha said to herself again. "And a wonderful scene full of vitality! Only at this time can people feel the beauty and loveliness of nature, and know that everything that has life has a considerable relationship with us humans..."</p>
<p>Her voice was very low and soft, and the following words were simply ambiguous; originally she herself had realized that the previous few words were really too awkward and too unreasonable, so she deliberately made them ambiguous. In fact, none of us paid attention to her words. Everyone had been deceived by their eyes, thinking that so many lotus flowers were blooming at the same time, there must be a wonderful sound to be heard, so everyone on the boat was like me, leaning their ears to listen carefully to the "lotus sound".

<p>World Wonders</p>
<p>— (Bingyu)</p>
<p>The world's oldest potato</p>
<p>In Mather Dante Village, Australia, the world's oldest potato was recently discovered. This potato belongs to Ulta, Ma Meli. According to Mr. Wu, it was left over from cooking by his grandmother when the first generation immigrated to this village. So, it has been 133 years now. Because this potato was placed on the stove shelf, no one knew about it. Later, it was heated and smoked, and gradually hardened, like red stone. After his grandmother died, she left this thing to his father. When his father left it, he said that this thing had been 83 years old. Now Mr. Wu has lived for another 60 years. Calculated together, it is indeed 133 years, which is a worldwide antique unseen.</p>

Now he still drinks three or four times a day, each time drinking at least five or six cups, and up to ten cups. Statistics show that he drinks 20 cups a day, but his appearance is like a person in his thirties, so some people say that drinking more black tea can make you live forever.</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 17 Don't Ask About a Daughter's Identity, Difficult to Speak Hidden Pain, Strive to See a Noble Person's Face, and Admire a High Style Together</p>
<p>Huanhua blushed and stood up and said, "Then, I am really grateful." Saying that, she bowed and left. He walked out of the room, and still heard Zhiqian sigh. As for the meaning of that sigh, she didn't care. Just as she turned around to walk outside, suddenly there was a very hurried footsteps coming from behind, followed by someone grabbing her lapel. Looking back, Zhang Jiefei had changed into a smiling face and was standing in front of her. He smiled and said, "I thought about it carefully. If you want me to help, I won't agree at all. It seems too sorry for you." Saying that, he lowered his voice and said: "Come at twelve o'clock tonight, and I will give you a little gift." Huanhua smiled faintly: "A little gift? How small is this?" Zhang Jiefei also smiled: "Even if it's two or three yuan, I will always give it to you." Huanhua snorted in her nose and smiled: "Keep it to buy food." Saying that, she turned around and walked away. Zhang Jiefei stood there dumbfounded. He couldn't move for a long time. Huanhua didn't care about him and walked to the outer courtyard. Naturally, she was also happy to go home. But when she arrived at the entrance of the hotel, she saw a young woman, followed by two pieces of luggage, walking in with a smile. As she walked, she said in a Nanjing accent with a smile: "The room rate here is not very expensive, and it's not as expensive as living in a small inn in Nanjing. It doesn't matter if I live here for three or four months." As she spoke, the high heels made a sound, filling her with a sense of contentment. Huanhua then thought that when I arrived in Xi'an back then, wasn't I so happy? But now, I have regarded this Little Western Paradise as a pit of fire. It is not easy to have the opportunity tomorrow, so I can jump out. However, there are still such people who are willing to live in this pit of fire for a few months. (289)</p>

<h3 id="e173">Gold Market in the Tug-of-War Between Bulls and Bears: Major Players Continue Selling, Once Triggering a Price Surge; Hedging Activities Increase by 3.9 Yuan <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>The gold market yesterday initially showed a weakening trend due to the efforts of major players to actively sell, leading to strong selling pressure. The Hong Kong market softened, but banks actively sought to absorb gold, engaging in hedging activities, which revived buying interest and gradually pushed prices up. Ultimately, the market remained firm. Initially, overseas silver markets saw declines in London and stability in the US. Furthermore, the final transaction of a large lot was 0.0625 lower than the closing price. Forward silver prices in Montreal fell by 0.4 to 0.04 cents. Exchange rates slightly lengthened, and London bullion remained unchanged. News reports indicated that the US Bank sent representatives, as this congressional session is about to adjourn, and will no longer pursue activities related to using silver as currency. This news slightly bolstered confidence. Off-market pre-market trading opened, rising to 0.067 yuan. Fuyu Yuanmao Yong's selling price dropped to 0.056 yuan. Hengyu and others strongly bid, once rising to 0.089 yuan. Fuxing Yongda Decheng immediately sold, causing a further decline. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates for British and American currencies remained unchanged, and the customs gold unit remained unchanged. The listed standard price for gold remained at 919.8 yuan. After opening, the market immediately weakened, with major players selling aggressively, causing a decline in the exchange rate. In the middle of the session, there were many transactions, anticipating that HSBC Bank would list British currency unchanged and American currency up by 0.0625. At this time, prices were relatively stable after initially falling, and there was still some rebound. However, when state-owned enterprises began to sell, major players became even more eager to sell, and short sellers secretly increased their positions, breaking through the 900 yuan barrier. However, because banks actively intervened, it was still easy to recover. Unfortunately, large Chinese merchants dumped aggressively, and the exchange rate hardened. Supply in the market exceeded demand, eventually leading to a further decline. Banks seized the opportunity to buy aggressively at low prices, managing to maintain stability. Prices gradually rebounded above 900 yuan, and speculative activity slightly subsided. The exchange rate slightly tightened, and hedging activities occurred. Predictions indicated that Indian silver would only increase by one anna. Prices once rose but were soon suppressed by sellers, weakening again at noon. In the afternoon, the Hong Kong market continued to soften, initially stabilizing the market. Later, rumors spread that the Hong Kong dollar would be changed to the British pound system, causing Chinese merchants to buy again, tightening the exchange rate and pushing prices up. Banks sold some, and major players continued to sell. Some even went short, keeping prices high. Indian silver was reported to be down one anna. Sassoon bought US dollars, and HSBC bought shillings, causing further price increases. Major players took advantage of the high prices to sell, leading to some retracement. Indian silver was once reported unchanged, keeping the situation stable. However, because buying interest had revived, the market ultimately remained firm. The market sentiment was initially weak but then firm. Major players competed fiercely, making it difficult to determine the trend. The daily market conditions are recorded below.</p>

But who knows that the new autumn is in order, the business market is tired and weakened, and is still as old as before, and it is even more inferior. Only its original cause is purely due to economic decline, weak purchasing power, and more than the number of people on ships, and goods are flooding the market, and profit sources are overflowing, so silver is flowing out, and there is a lack of chips, and the entire Shanghai business market is not turning over smoothly, so all industries sit and die.

<p>Yesterday, the Overseas Chinese Commercial Securities Exchange was weak, but because the 48th continued to absorb, it relied on the extreme promotion, and the market price was not linearly falling. At the same time, the 46th and 56th, etc., also have purchases, but the sellers such as 21, 26, and 78, etc., are all eager, so the market price struggles and does not rise. The situation is extremely weak, the countertop is still tight, once muddy, and will eventually go downstream. Yesterday's experience, the opening selling momentum was strong, and Dai Bing dropped sharply by half a yuan this month. Thereafter, due to the pull of 48, etc., the decline was slightly reduced, but it was also about two or three corners. The second panel was slightly mixed, uneven, and ups and downs were seen each other, and the number was only about one corner. No. 21 has always sold out. Although No. 48 is still absorbing, the force has been slackened, only in price support, and it has failed to pull up. The situation turns weak, and it is temporarily difficult to revive. The total market price result is a consistent decline, and the total market price result is a consistent decline.

<p>The yarn market fell in the morning and rose in the afternoon. Overseas cotton yarn conditions fell consistently. The local market sentiment was not hit, because both bulls and bears have considerable enemy power. The walls were strong, but the environment was still not good. Inland commercial conditions fell. There is no active hope for yarn sales. As for the needs of customers, it was obviously active on the previous day, but yesterday it turned again.</p>
<p>Gold Morning Low Afternoon High</p>
<p>Before the opening of the yarn tendering market, each month fell consistently. The August period fell by one yuan one corner, and the far fell by six and seven corners. Because foreign cotton fell, the market sentiment was slack. After two or three panels of shooting, the Dafu bulls came to increase the code again, and the market panel rose by three or four corners. As a result, each month fell by three, four and seven corners compared with the closing price of the previous day. The market suddenly rose after opening in the afternoon. The countertop suddenly tightened. To find out the reason, it is said that the bulls continued to increase the code, and the chips in the market were dry, and the buyers took the opportunity to lift it, and the market price was the highest. However, the transaction of the current yarn was not as prosperous as the previous day. In addition to the fall of two yuan in the three-grade yarn, the local market sentiment was quite good. As a result, each month rose by eight, nine corners to one yuan one and two corners compared with the closing price of the morning. It was found that the sold was the same as floating three hundred and fifty bags, Yu Da seven hundred bags, Da Feng three hundred and fifty bags, Zhen Da three hundred and fifty bags, Geng Feng five hundred bags, Xin Ji seven hundred bags, Yuan Yi four hundred bags, Da Chang Cheng eight hundred bags, Yi Chang nine hundred bags, Chang Feng eight hundred bags, Yong Da five hundred bags, Xin Cheng four hundred bags, and bought Ji Feng four hundred and fifty bags, Da Fu one thousand eight hundred and fifty bags, Mei Ji one thousand four hundred and fifty bags, Da Ji six hundred bags, Jin Chang one thousand one hundred and fifty bags, Ren Feng one thousand one hundred and fifty bags, Xin Cheng seven hundred bags, and the highest and lowest price and closing price in a day are listed below.</p>

<p>The cotton market started to rise and then fall, but the August period was particularly firm. The amount of long-term absorption has not been released. It is said that the bull's target must look at 37 yuan. The peak yesterday was 36 yuan one corner and a half. As for the new cotton, it was also stimulated to be high. However, the US and Indian cotton markets showed unstable signs.</p>
<p>New Flowers Also Led</p>
<p>Before the opening of the tender flower market, in addition to the hard-hitting of this month's period, the far month followed the foreign cotton down and weak. November, December, and January, the three dates, all broke through the three-yuan barrier at the same time. After the shooting-to-closing period, the tender gold entered the nine-hundred-yuan barrier, and then went out of the barrier, and fell by one and a half corners. After the market opened in the afternoon, the August period was particularly firm, and the rising power was more sufficient, and it wore out the six-yuan barrier. At the same time, the yarn market stepped up, which made people more supportive. When shooting to closing, the far-month rising wind was also strong. However, the three-grade American cotton fell by five and eight one corners. As a result, each month rose by one and a half corners to three and a half corners compared with the afternoon closing price in the morning. It was found that the sold Yuanda one thousand eight hundred gantan, Yuan Yi three thousand one hundred gantan, Yi Chang one thousand nine hundred gantan, Wei Feng one thousand nine hundred gantan, Run Kang two thousand five hundred gantan, Xinhua eight hundred gantan, Changhe one thousand gantan, Yuanxingchang one thousand five hundred gantan, and bought Geng Feng two thousand eight hundred gantan, Ji Feng eight hundred gantan, Dafu two thousand one gantan, Zhen Da one thousand one hundred gantan, Dachang one thousand eight hundred gantan, Changhe three thousand one hundred gantan, Run Kang two thousand six hundred gantan, and the highest and lowest price and closing price in a day are as follows.</p>

<p>(Tianjin Communication) The Xihe Flower Market is still flat, and consumption is not strong. Western merchants have completely stopped, so the sale price is difficult to raise. It was found that the Japanese merchants bought 100 packages, and the opening price was 37 yuan. Another 137 packages were priced at 37 yuan two corners. The Huaxin Textile Factory bought 100 packages, and the price was 37 yuan seven corners.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened, and each month fell by ten to twelve pounds. Thereafter, Liverpool's news was bad and the South sold, and it continued to be weak. In the middle, due to the purchase of the same industry and the complement of the short, there was a slight reaction. However, there were not many buyers. In the afternoon, brokers and New Orleans threw and sold. Merchants were afraid of increasing the volume of sales and dared not buy. The market price fell again. The weather was generally smooth. The western temperature was suspected to be high. The closing price was still stable. It is estimated that the spot fell by ten pounds, and the futures fell by five to fifteen pounds. British cotton spot fell by seven points, and futures fell by four to six points. Indian cotton was tired due to the conclusion of the long and short, and the spot merchants compensated, and it is estimated that the two falls of Pingguo are 0.75 and the ratio, Aomla fell by 2.5 Roby, and the Ba Luoxi July and August period fell by seven and the ratio, and the April and May period fell by two hard ratios.

<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning, each month was calm, with foreign wheat quotations, Chicago small three, five and six corners, Canada small six corners zero. The market sentiment, because of the foreign wheat, was two days in a row, and the gold market was more loose, and the saying that the factory was closed, and the saying that the factory was closed, and the saying that the factory was closed, is not likely to become a reality at present, so the opening price of each panel is inevitably weak, and it is about half a point lower than the day before. By the afternoon, the transaction was not strong, and the buyers also waited and saw and did not advance. The factory slightly has a set, and the market is slightly weaker. However, before the foreign wheat can be agreed upon, it will not be too tired. As a result, this month is small two and a half cents, September fell one point, one two abundant half, October to December fell one point, and January fell one point two and a half cents.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the forward wheat market, after opening in the morning, each month was stable, with foreign wheat quotations, although it fell by three, five and six corners, the industry and outside of the market was small, and there was very little movement at first because of the current wheat. The majority of the current transactions are occupied by people in the industry, so the rise and fall can not be consistent. In the afternoon, experts have set to sell both near and far periods, and it is said that the current foreign wheat is shouted at four yuan eight corners zero, so the market sentiment is suddenly Lu, and the morning fell three or four points or more. As a result, this month fell by three points, September fell by four points, October fell by three points, November fell by four points, December fell by five points. The current wheat is stored less, and the traffickers are always optimistic, in order to keep the flour and wheat Xingyang wheat consistently small, and the factory took the opportunity to hold it, in order to suppress the price and then do it, and then the two sides squeezed each other, and there was no transaction. A small number of traffickers sent it to the factory, and the price was similar to the previous market.</p>

The high prices of foreign rice immediately stood small three or five points, but after the market price was small, the stomach of the street and the inland was revived, and the market price was tired again.

<h3 id="e184">Recovery of the Kuling British Concession <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>The long-negotiated matter of recovering the Kuling British Concession has now come to a conclusion. On the 8th of this month, our representative Jiang Zhicheng and British Consul-General Moss jointly signed the agreement. The content of the agreement is as follows: (1) Return the land lease of the British concession of 1905 to our country; (2) The public utilities within the original concession will be managed by the Chinese government; (3) British residents in Kuling may establish an advisory committee for Chinese consultation, but our country has the final decision-making power on matters of consultation. This recovery of the concession involves four locations: (1) Changhang, (2) Yishengwa, (3) Caodipo, (4) Dalianchong, all of which are scenic spots in Kuling.</p>
<p>The existence of a British concession in Kuling may no longer be noticed by our countrymen. Therefore, the recovery of this concession this time may not arouse our excitement. But this is indeed the result of our country's diplomatic efforts. For an independent country, it must have autonomy over all its territory, even the smallest inch. Therefore, the recovery of the Kuling British Concession must be regarded as a matter worth celebrating.</p>
<p>However, the recovery of the Kuling British Concession has even greater significance. It makes it clear to all countries that our country is determined to recover concessions. The negotiation and recovery of the Kuling British Concession is only the first step in our country's diplomatic work. In the future, we hope that concessions in various places can also be continuously recovered. This is precisely the right that our country should have.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people say that it is easy to recover the concession land in Kuling, but it is difficult to recover the concession land in other places. The reason why Britain is willing to return the Kuling concession is because the Kuling concession is not very important and can only be used for summer resorts. If it is the Shanghai International Settlement, which is the economic center of the British in the Far East, it would not be easy for them to give it up. This is indeed true. However, this time Britain returned the Kuling concession, although it was willing to give it up because the Kuling concession was not important. But this is also considered a kind of goodwill from a friendly country. In the future, if our government authorities can make further efforts at appropriate times, it is not absolutely impossible to recover concessions in various places.</p>
<h3 id="e185">The Seashore of Tangjiawan <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Ai Tu</p>
<p>With a heart full of remembrance, and with a pleasant breath, I once again boarded the car, quickly heading to the famous Tangjiawan for a stroll. As the car sped towards the southeast, I felt as if my body was passing through high mountains, and there was no end to the beautiful rural scenery to see. Unfortunately, the car was traveling so fast that it was just a fleeting "riding a horse and watching flowers." Before long, we could see the sea to the southeast from the carriage. That was the sea of Tangjiawan. The vast sea, illuminated by the evening sun, was a sweeping arc, unfolding far and wide, with gently drifting white waves reflecting the golden sunlight, turning into a beautiful color picture, covering everything on the sea. A few small warships and many merchant ships were sparsely moored in the center of the sea.</p>
<p>When the car took us to the seaside, we could breathe in the fresh sea breeze and hear the soft sound of the waves crashing against the rocks, the white waves thrown out, scattering into the sky.</p>
<p>Arriving at Tangjiawan, the site of the Zhongshan County Government, I had always fantasized that it would be magnificent, with good architecture and commerce. However, it was simply empty, a dilapidated small city, the coldness of commerce so pitiful, not even one-tenth of Shiqi. Everything gave us a sense of dread, only decay. Especially in recent years, the impact of political changes has created seeds of misfortune everywhere.</p>
<p>On the roads and small streets, we couldn't see any particularly good buildings, and the roads were sometimes bumpy and difficult to drive on. All the images were desolate and bleak. All of this couldn't help but disappoint me.</p>
<p>Wandering alone on the seashore, strolling at the foot of the mountain, my mood was so desolate – I carried many desolate shadows, moving with everything in the dusk. Yes, I always have many, many dreams when I wander on such journeys. When I stared at the small warships moored on the vast sea, I seemed to see a terrible war about to break out there. Yes, this is a very good county, but I don't know how many people are treating the people as expendable, engaging in extreme deception and exploitation. How terrible! The peaceful countryside has long been engulfed in man-eating shadows, and it's no wonder that everything here is so desolate and bleak.</p>
<p>The colors of dusk have gradually become dark and terrifying.</p>
<p>The vast bay is also covered with a terrifying curtain, but everything is still silent. There is no noisy sound in the market, no atmosphere of a big city, gradually buried in the circle of death, and people are gradually going to sleep.</p>
<p>However, I am still wandering alone on the seashore, breathing in the sea breeze, trying to find some comforting scenery on this silent seashore. But everything is hidden in the god of the night, with terrifying claws everywhere, the shadows swaying. The sea's answer to me is only the sound of the waves crashing, revealing a certain tone. Other than that, nothing can be heard.</p>
<p>When I returned to my lodging in the market with weariness, many people were already quiet, only the pale yellow lights on the street were still flickering desolately. Indeed, once night falls, everything in Tangjiawan is already buried in the circle of death.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Beside the Train Tracks <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Qin</p>
<p>When my hazy, bloated head is raised towards the vast and boundless blue sky, and I gaze at the thousands of miles of floating white clouds, I seem to be startled and ask myself: "How do I live every day?" It feels like a moment of awakening, filled with disappointment and loss. But after a while, my mood sinks to who knows where, and I lower my heavy head.</p>
<p>I've moved more than ten times recently, and I don't even know what's going on. I just feel restless, like a bird that can't find a nest to settle in. A bed, a small table, a suitcase, a chair, moving them back and forth, only seeing them get damaged, and seeing myself getting thinner. It's as if my home has become a child who doesn't know how to live.</p>
<p>This time, I moved to Jiangwan, a village. In the fiery torrent, I escaped from the steamer-like small pavilion and came here to experience some cool breeze that seems to have no owner. I began to relax a few breaths, and sometimes in the evening, sitting in front of the door, welcoming the gentle breeze, I even felt a slight awakening of life. However, that moment of awakening disappeared quickly, and it seemed like a long time since I had been cut off from the cool breeze; although the cool breeze blows morning and evening, floating the light silk sleeves of people who are relaxed and the freely swaying leaves. It can't blow away the endless accumulation of my heavy, swollen, hot, and numb chest and brain!</p>
<p>Sometimes, I catch a glimpse of the green grass in front, the secluded shady place, where girls and boys are taking leisurely, indulgent, and pleasant strolls, chatting, singing softly, indulging in beautiful and vast reveries, and wandering freely and lightly. I can't help but wonder suddenly: Why am I always living such a depressed life for no reason? I can spend my days like them, and be as happy as them. However, as soon as this thought arrives, it disappears, and I am still my depressed self. Even if I want to go, I don't know how to make it happen even once. As for the park I envy, I often dream of being able to immerse myself in the cool, secluded green forest every day, which would at least be good for my wounded body and mind. Who knew that after saving a dollar to buy a park ticket, I never actually went in.</p>
<p>I not only don't know why this is, but the thought of it only increases my depression!</p>
<p>Is my life forever like a nightmare?</p>
<p>In front of my house, two railway tracks stretch out windingly. I live a lonely, isolated, and painful life beside these train tracks. At first, I was always blank and silent towards them. And the sharp cries of the trains that constantly run over the tracks make me very disgusted and angry. Their sharp cries irritate my brain and make me even more uneasy.</p>
<p>But once, when my angry eyes followed a train as it sped forward like thunder and lightning, the heroic, speedy, mighty, and forward posture awakened me and made me marvel with joy, a surge of emotion welling up. The spring of my heart, which had passed away, is running again! My life suddenly feels awakened! I am immersed in clear reminiscence. I discover that only at this moment am I truly awake! This is what can keep me from being numb!</p>
<p>Therefore, the piercing cries of the trains no longer make me resentful. Every time a cruel nightmare awakens me from the dark middle of the night! I often get up, open the door, and go out. I watch the trains speeding forward, and under the quiet night through which the trains have passed, I feel the magnificence and vastness of the surrounding night scenery make me happy. The cool night breeze finally blows all over my body, making me even more awake. Standing quietly, I am calm and excited, and I feel some fullness of life. I am just now discovering my own existence!</p>

<p>— Xin Ye</p>
<p>"Well! Our boat is docked at the cement factory pier outside the city. It's about a dozen miles away from the city. This area is all countryside, so I don't know if there's any place to get a meal." The boat owner replied to me like this.</p>
<p>The sun had set, and although the boat was still moving forward in this vast expanse of misty waves, my heart was as heavy as if it were filled with a thousand pieces of lead.</p>
<p>When the boat reached the pier, a crescent moon had quietly hidden overhead, emitting a charming soft light. I jumped ashore and shouted "Goodbye" to the people on the boat, but in my heart, I was actually quite hesitant. I couldn't think of a solution, so I had to follow the boat owner's instructions and walk along the road to the east. Fortunately, the moonlight that night was very bright, so I could still make out the direction and the road.</p>
<p>Dragging a lonely shadow, walking on this dark road like a ghost, I couldn't help but feel a little apprehensive. The village dogs were barking incessantly, and I really didn't know what to do!</p>
<p>"Wouldn't it be better to inquire about Xu Village and stay overnight at my cousin's house and then figure things out? Anyway, I'm not familiar with the area, and it's inconvenient to travel at night." In my desperation, I came up with an idea and remembered that there was a forgotten cousin here, so I planned to stay there for the night.</p>
<p>So, I knocked on a door by the road and asked for directions to Xu Village!</p>
<p>Xu Village was such a desolate and isolated village, not connected to any other village to the front, back, left, or right. I asked several families in a row, asked many questions, and said "I'm sorry" countless times before I finally found my cousin's house.</p>
<p>That cousin was a lonely old woman. Her uncle had passed away long ago, and she had no cousins, but she had managed to save some money in her hands, so she could live out her lonely old age peacefully! When she saw her cousin, whom she hadn't seen in three years, how she squinted her old, presbyopic eyes in welcome!</p>
<p>That night, I lay in bed, tossing and turning and unable to fall asleep, just staring blankly at the ray of moonlight that shone in through the window hole; staring blankly at the four walls, the room was empty and I couldn't help but feel a little scared.</p>
<p>Later, I finally fell asleep because I was too tired, so I don't know when I fell asleep. When I woke up, I saw the sun had slipped into the room. At that time, my cousin was standing at the door of the room with a smile:</p>
<p>"Cousin, you're up early! Sleep a little longer!"</p>
<p>But I had to do my own business, and it would be too much to fail her kind hospitality. (The End)</p>
<h3 id="e188">Entering the City <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Sun</p>
<p>When the sky was just showing a sliver of white on the skylight, A Cui rolled out of the tattered bedding. But in this damp bedroom, it was still as dark as hell: the light from the skylight could only illuminate a few inches. So A Cui opened her eyes wide, like a wild cat, trying to find her object. She tiptoed out of bed and felt a soft piece of clothing on a three-legged stool. The touch of her fingers told her that it was the patterned cloth jacket that she had been looking forward to day and night.</p>
<p>The darkness seemed to release some light, and she quickly put it on. Using the light coming in from the skylight, she wanted to take a look at her own reflection in the small mirror on the wall. Although it didn't reflect a flower-like beauty as she had imagined, she could only vaguely see the spots of the patterned fabric in the tofu-sized frame. Even so, she felt that the body wrapped in the patterned fabric was a beautiful, reborn person.</p>
<p>So she laughed, uncontrollably, but it woke up her parents in their sleep.</p>
<p>The bedroom was gradually brightening, and when A Cui's parents saw their daughter wearing the new jacket, yesterday's events were brought up again in their two old hearts. Such a young daughter, but given to the Zhou village elder for no reason? But thinking about the years of unpaid rent, the old father couldn't help but shed tears. Just because of that one reason, owing rent to Zhou village elder, he couldn't consider his daughter's lifelong happiness.</p>
<p>Yesterday, A Cui's father was summoned away by the bailiff in the morning and didn't return home until sunset. He looked as if he had done a day's hard labor, and couldn't even stand up straight when he walked. As soon as he entered the door, he lay on the bed like a lazy ox, ignoring anyone's questions, as if the questioners were his enemies. He stared at the mother and daughter with bloodshot eyes. The daughter had already started crying, thinking that her father was seriously ill in her weak heart, because her father had never been like that before.</p>
<p>The elderly mother already knew what was going on: the bailiff was never a good person. Whenever he came to the door, it meant bad luck for someone. A Cui's father had been summoned for the whole day, so it couldn't be anything good. But she didn't expect that the bad thing would fall on her daughter.</p>
<p>The matter was like this: when the father with bloodshot eyes told them about the deadline set by the bailiff, the mother couldn't hold back her tears any longer. She stamped her bound feet and cursed, cursing Zhou village elder for being a bloodsucker; cursing the bailiff, that dog, for always offering him big fish and meat on holidays, but ending up helping that demon to plot against her own daughter. So she felt as if her daughter was about to be taken away and hugged her into her arms. But the daughter didn't know what they were arguing about. Her mother often cried, so it must be someone forcing her to give them money. She looked around the simple bedroom carefully and knew that the valuable things had been taken away. So her eyes fell on the new foreign-made cloth jacket, which her father hadn't had time to pawn today because that dog was forcing her father to leave. She naively told her mother to use it to pay off the debt, and that she could go hungry for a few days.</p>
<p>"What good would that do!" The mother scolded, but she immediately understood that her daughter knew that there wasn't a single penny left in the house. She thought that this jacket could pay off her father's debts. She hugged her daughter even tighter and said softly with tears in her eyes: "This jacket can't be given to anyone. You put it on, and your father will take you to the city tomorrow."</p>
<p>The old man's eyes were still bloodshot, and the new patterned jacket seemed like a man-eating leopard in front of him, about to snatch away his daughter. But what could he do? He owed people money.</p>

<p>Mr. Zhuangzi himself beat the pot and sang. From then on, the broken strings were no longer tuned. His wife passed away without sorrow. He sang a high song and chanted casually. His close friend, Hui Zi, came to mourn, blaming him for having no affection for his wife. When the wife dies, the husband should bury her well, without a coffin or clothing. If the husband dies, the wife remarries, she will be ashamed even in the Yellow Springs. Her belongings are not for her own use, and her fields are let to others to cultivate. People laugh at me for having no tears, and I laugh at them ten thousand times. Crying is useless when someone dies. It's not certain that crying will bring back the soul. If anyone can cry until someone comes back to life, I should also cry a few times. From now on, there is no need to worry about domestic affairs, detached from the world like an immortal. He seeks pleasure outside the world, with no intention of pursuing fame and fortune in the mortal world. Life is fleeting and difficult to last, and one wakes up from the hundred-year dream. He visited Chang Sangzi all over the world, tireless in his search. Even if he can't become an immortal, he is still happy.</p>

<p>"Sister Sa, are you really Sa?"</p>
<p>Most people, upon seeing Cang Yinqiu, nicknamed "Sister Sa," would have this question in their minds, wanting to ask Cang Yinqiu directly. However, the words would reach their throats and then be swallowed back. No one has ever dared to ask Cang Yinqiu such a question, fearing that she would turn her face and not recognize them, resulting in an embarrassing situation. Thus, whether Cang Yinqiu is really "Sa" remains a question. Because unless she personally admits it publicly, it cannot be established.</p>
<p>The reason Cang Yinqiu has the nickname "Sister Sa" may seem like an insult to those who don't understand the details, a public defamation. But in reality, it is high praise for Madam Cang because her "silly" performance in "Human Fairy" achieved valuable success, hence the nickname. Madam Cang also understands and has never refused the bestowal of "Sister Sa," but she has also never admitted to it, perhaps out of "self-deprecation"?</p>
<p>Because Madam Cang is unwilling to clearly express her acceptance or rejection of the "Sister Sa" nickname, people want to ask Madam Cang face-to-face, "Sister Sa, are you really Sa?" But people are also timid and dare not ask.</p>
<p>Yuan Congmei is very clever. He accurately grasped people's psychology and specially, in his directed sound film "Storm," called on Madam Cang to personally answer people's question about her: are you "Sister Sa"? If you want Madam Cang to answer your long-standing question, just go and see the premiere of the "Storm" sound film, and you will understand.</p>
<p>Pay attention! "Storm" is about to be released.</p>

<p>Today there are children's tickets for free</p>
<p>The Lianhua Company's blockbuster "Little Angel," since its premiere at the Jincheng Theater, has been a great success, breaking all box office records for films shown during the summer season at the theater. The long-dormant Chinese film industry seems to have received another shot of excitement. This is because Wang Renmei has not released any works for a long time, and the people of the country eagerly desired her return. Moreover, Wu Yonggang, the director of "The Goddess," has long given film fans a good impression, and there is also Lin Chuchu, who plays a good mother and virtuous wife, the already successful child star Ge Zuozhi, the experienced Li Junpan, and Tang Tianxiu and Liu Qiong, who play wealthy couples, all adding much glory to the film. In the film, the sincere sibling love between Wang Renmei and Ge Zuozhi will move people to tears. This is indeed a good play with the most real emotions and noble sentiments, and it is worth seeing for anyone. Furthermore, in order to benefit children, the theater, in response to requests from all sectors, will give away a children's ticket valid for the same performance for every ticket purchased starting today.</p>

<h3 id="e198">A Major Innovation in the Automotive World Rear-Engine Car Successfully Tested <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Currently, the common cars we are accustomed to all have the engine installed in the front. The engine's power propels the entire car forward. The most important part of the car is installed at the front. If the front of the car collides with something due to careless driving, and the engine is damaged, the entire car will be immobilized and unable to move forward. In recent years, car manufacturers have ingeniously researched moving the engine to the rear. After several field tests and reforms, this so-called rear-engine car has been a great success. Its various advantages, such as stability and fuel efficiency, are fascinating. This can be described as a major innovation in automobile manufacturing. The following describes the driving situation of America's first rear-engine car, the "Scarab," and the ironclad proof of the successful testing of this rear-engine car.</p>
<p>This rear-engine car, dubbed "the car of tomorrow," the "Scarabb," was introduced to the automotive world by its inventor, William Stout, four months ago. Now, due to its performance results, it has proven to be an absolute success. This rear-engine car was originally unknown and obscure. It was not until February of this year, when its creator, Stout, came forward to introduce it and greet people in the automotive industry, that it began to attract attention. Since that first appearance, this "Scarabb" has been driven by its owner every day, braving the wind and rain. Unconsciously, more than four months have passed. In these 120-plus days, the roads it has traveled are also truly impressive. According to its owner's calculation, it has traveled over 22,000 miles. In this long journey of 22,000 miles, it has passed through good and bad roads of all kinds. Moreover, the weather and environment in different places are completely different. It can be said that every place has its own unique flavor. On average, it travels about 500 miles per day. The speed is 60 miles per hour when fast and 55 miles per hour when slow. Overall, in the daily mileage of more than 500 miles, the speed per hour is around 50 or 60 miles, which cannot be said to be as slow as a snail climbing a wall.</p>
<p>In this preliminary test, according to Stout, the inventor of the "Scarabb," the fuel consumption is extremely economical. The total fuel consumption is only 20 quarts, and on average, one gallon of gasoline can travel 18 miles. Stout was encouraged by this initial success and decided to build 100 cars within this year, and then continue to manufacture and sell them. According to a report from the end of June in Detroit, the "Scarabb's" second version will be born in July. It is also reported that once it is fully equipped, it will also undergo thorough testing on various roads like its older brother. The braking part of the car is hydraulically controlled.</p>
<p>Stout's first test journey was from Detroit to Florida and back to the starting point. During this journey, the "Scarabb" only needed one nail of water for cooling in the engine. The second journey still started from Detroit, passed through Los Angeles to Seattle, and then returned to its starting point - Detroit. This Stout and his companions were really enjoying themselves. They sat in the car as if they were traveling in a comfortable compartment. At night, the movable seat could be disassembled and moved to form a bed, so they could sleep comfortably in the car. They not only ate in the car, but also drank coffee for entertainment after meals. At this time, the coffee cups in the compartment, and the liquid inside, did not spill out at all.</p>
<p>When the "Scarabb" passed through the western states, the wind was very strong. But thanks to the streamlined shape of the car body, it did not feel uncomfortable at all. When passing through Kansas City, it encountered a dust devil. The dust filled the air, making it impossible to see the scenery. They had no choice but to sigh and complain. They were confined to a hotel by the dust storm, unable to move a step. It was not until the dust in the room had slightly subsided and they could barely see things clearly outside the three storefronts that they added some oil to the car's engine. The windows and vents were tightly closed to prevent the dust storm from invading. According to Stout's later account, "There was less dust inside the car than in the hotel room," which is also thought-provoking.</p>
<p>Because the engine of the rear-engine car is installed at the back, the power comes from behind, making it extremely easy and effortless to climb hills. Moreover, because of the sharp modification of the car body, it is easy to see from any angle. During this test journey, the exhaust emissions from the engine and the heat generated by the radiator were reduced. Stout said that this was due to the rear-engine installation.</p>
<p>Some say that automobile king Henry Ford is very concerned and interested in this rear-engine "Scarabb" car. Stout said, "That has nothing to do with it, although sometimes I think it would be best if there was." The entire "Scarabb" looks like a beetle, entirely made of tubular fine steel welded together. According to Stout, it is even stronger than a Pullman car body.</p>
<p>The ventilation system in the car is a direct-flow system, allowing air to flow smoothly from the front to the back. The car body is fully insulated, and even the windows are fitted with special heat-insulating glass. Stout estimates that all American car factories will be manufacturing this type of rear-engine car in the next three years.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Several Simple Formulas Regarding Car Engines <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Lu</p>
<p>1.  Cylinder Volume (Piston displacement)</p>
<p>The so-called cylinder volume, also known as displacement, refers to the volume of space that the piston passes through during each stroke. The stroke referred to here is the distance the piston travels from the inside to the outside or from the outside to the inside. It can also be said to be the distance the piston travels when the crank moves from top dead center to bottom dead center, or from bottom dead center to top dead center. If we already know the cylinder bore and stroke, the cylinder volume is not difficult to calculate. When we want to express the size of an engine, we should omit the words cylinder bore and stroke and only write two numbers. For example, 4.4 represents the cylinder bore, and 5 represents the stroke. Thus, a 4.4-5 engine means an engine with a 4-inch bore and a 5-inch stroke.</p>
<p>The cylinder volume of an engine is equal to the volume of one cylinder multiplied by the number of cylinders in the engine. This can be expressed by the following formula:</p>
<p>In the United States, cars are graded according to horsepower. This horsepower is calculated by formulas set by the Association of Licensed Automobile Manufacturers and the Society of Automotive Engineers. The horsepower calculated by this formula is not necessarily the correct horsepower under all circumstances, nor is it theoretically correct power. However, it is used to compare different engines.</p>
<p>This formula is derived from the formula for calculating the horsepower of steam engines. The formula for calculating the horsepower of steam engines is:</p>
<p>This formula is specifically for single-cylinder steam engines, and each stroke of the piston is a power stroke. To make this formula suitable for calculating the power of four-stroke car engines, it must be multiplied by the number of cylinders in the engine. Furthermore, since there is only one power stroke in a four-stroke engine, it must be divided by four. Thus, the formula for calculating the horsepower of a four-stroke engine is as follows:</p>
<p>To apply this formula to car engines, it has been determined that the piston speed is an average of 1,000 feet per minute, the average pressure is 10 pounds per square inch, and the mechanical efficiency is 75 percent. Substituting these values into the formula above, we get:</p>
<p>Modern engines have piston speeds that far exceed 1,000 feet per minute. If we calculate the ratio between the actual piston speed and the assumed piston speed, and then multiply this ratio by the horsepower calculated from the above formula, the result obtained will not be far from the power actually generated. To illustrate this point, let's still use the example above. The piston stroke is five and a half inches, and the crankshaft rotates 2,400 revolutions per minute. The piston speed is equal to the number of feet the piston travels per two revolutions multiplied by the number of revolutions per minute. In this case, the piston travels five and a half inches per stroke, and the crankshaft travels eleven inches per revolution. Then, at a speed of 2,400 revolutions, the piston will travel per minute:</p>
<p>This horsepower number is very close to the power actually generated by the engine.</p>
<p>Now, let's present a table of indicated horsepower as stipulated by the Society of Automotive Engineers for reference.</p>

<p>A Large Revenue for the U.S. Government: According to statistics from U.S. government statisticians, the total number of various automobiles registered in the United States in 1934 was 24,933,403. These more than 20 million automobiles paid a total of $304,928,000 in registration fees and other miscellaneous fees to the government in the past three years. This is indeed a large revenue for the U.S. government.</p>
<p>A Glimmer of Prosperity in the Automotive Industry: The Pierce-Arrow car factory has been affected by the economic downturn in recent years. Its car factory in Evansville, Indiana, had already been closed due to downsizing. Recently, due to increased sales of Pierce-Arrow cars, the company's management has decided to restore the factory. They are currently assembling machinery and expect to start work in July or August of this year. The factory has been closed for three years. This restoration may be a small sign of prosperity in the American automotive industry.</p>
<p>Ford's Reforms for Next Year: Henry Ford, the boss of Ford Motor Company, recently stated informally that the appearance of Ford cars for next year (1936) will not undergo major changes. He said this entirely for the sake of car buyers. Because many people who bought cars this year will not feel that their car's style will become outdated next year. Therefore, the new Ford of next year will at most be improved in terms of internal components, while the appearance will remain the same. Ford's move, although ostensibly for the sake of buyers, is ultimately to generate more business for himself. After he said this, he can sell at least tens of thousands more cars this year.</p>

<p>8,800 Employees Hired at the Beginning of the Year</p>
<p>Plan to Produce 100,000 Cars</p>
<p>According to news from Detroit, Michigan, Hudson Motor Car Company had a total of 8,800 employees at the start of work this year, an increase of 60 percent compared to the 5,500 employees on the first day of work in 1934. According to the company's plan for the production of Hudson and Terraplane cars in 1935, the total output will be more than 100,000 vehicles. In 1934, the total output was only 86,000 vehicles.</p>
<p>In order to implement this new production plan, the company's expenditure on materials and other items will inevitably increase. It is estimated that the annual expenditure on this item will reach more than 40 million yuan. Among them, steel will be the largest expenditure, followed by rubber tires, textiles, castings, wheels, starting components, lighting equipment, ignition equipment, and carriages, glass, and wireless radios. According to the company's planned production for 1935, it will be the largest amount in any year since 1930. The total export volume in 1930 was 113,898 vehicles.</p>
