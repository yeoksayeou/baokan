<h3 id="c18">日本工商業發展之因素 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>日本自明治維新以後全國人士始發憤圖强效法歐美力謀工商業之振興故日本工商業發展至今不過四十年耳今則日本之工商業已雄視世界非惟紡織業方面奪得素執牛耳之英國地位而一五年來重工業之發展尤爲國際所震驚據日本商工省調查一九三四年國金屬工業及機械器具工業之生產額均較上年增加百分之五十以上其發展之速殆僅亞於社會主義之蘇聯矣且自一九二九年以來經濟恐　瀰漫世界各工業國皆感生產過剩之苦而日本則挾其通貨膨脹之武器將廉價生產品傾銷於國際市塲對外輸出竟年有增加此種情勢對於世界各國經濟方面之威脅至深且鉅此次國際商會聯合會在巴黎開會首先注意日貨競爭問題提出討論非無故也</p>
<p>英國實業界領袖貝爾福爵士在大俞致開會詞有日貨在全世界競爭有益而無害之語自非無視日貨傾銷之威脅性實欲激勵各舊工業國效法日本之堅苦精神耳據貝爾福爵士所觀察日本工商業發展之原因蓋有二端一在日本採取世界各大國之生產方法而加以精深之研究。一在日本之勞動力因民間生活程度甚低之故較他國爲廉以上二因誠屬至確但吾人以爲日本工商業在此短促之數十年間所以能發榮滋長至如此稈度者尚有一重要原因在卽政府方面對工商業之獎勵與保護及金融資本家對工商業之通力合作是也</p>
<p>日本政府對於本國工商業之愛護可謂無微不至日貨之在國際市塲處於劣勢者往往因國家之補助而得以傾銷仳界至日本金融資本家尤與工商業打成一片觀於各大財閥在工業方面投資之數字實可驚人近年世界經濟競爭日趨烈各國無不高築關稅壁壘日本工商業無論本身若何努力苟非獲得政治上金融上之恊助安能抗禦國際間險惡的波濤乎</p>
<p>吾人再一考察吾國工商業之情豐。益感此項原因之重要吾國勞動力之低廉初不亞於日本近年來工業方面尤人才輩出在若干部門之生產技術茶且足以招致日人之嫉妒例如天津之製鹼工業乃日人屢次嘗試而遭失敗者在國人經營之下竟有顯著之成績此外若紡織業若電器工業其出品之優良往往有凌駕日貨者此數年中國家多難地方不靖而各項新興工業仍風起雲湧成績斐然尤見國人經營實業之毅力不在日人下吾人就此以觀吾國工商業之前途未始不可樂觀徒以處於國際帝國主義勢力高厭之下政府保育政策有時旣形禁勢格而金融界對工商業又不能澈底合作工商業遂不得不陷於停滯狀熊矣</p>
<p>近來吾國政府及金融界對於工商業漸知有予以維護之必要最近國府公布修正海關出口稅率及金融界定期實施工商貸欵卽此種意回之表現當此工商業極度衰落之際此等局部救濟之舉誠不免有杯水車薪之感然此愛護工商業之精神苟能皇而光大之亦未始非我國工商業復興之原動力也</p>

<p>（羅馬）現信艾登今日啟程赴巴黎前、意相墨索里尼曾向說明意國對阿比亞尼亞問題之目的如下、（一）意國殖民地和平保有之權利、（二）意人赴阿比西尼亞建造公路鐵路與橋梁及開辦學校之權利、（三）意國用其良好勢力開化該國之權利據消息靈通之意人各界聲稱、意國並不準備贊助擴張殖民地之要求、現信艾登曾奉其本國政府訓令提出若干建議但聆意相之言後、覺意國殊不欲接受任何局部解决、（二十六日路透電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）一般人相信英意談話欲謀解决阿比西尼亞問題已歸失敗、英國不管部大臣艾登雖提出英國方面之調解方法、而意相墨索里尼則明白加以拒絕、艾登建議准由意國建造鐵道、通過阿比西尼亞領士、以使意屬索謀里倫與愛里德里兩地互相聯結、對於阿比西尼亞、則由英國許其使用英屬索謀里倫通至紅海之各海口、以作報酬、此項提議、聞已由墨索里尼拒絕、墨索里尼表示、意國對於阿比西尼亞問題、係作整個看法、意國認爲唯有澈底變更阿比西尼亞政制、方爲唯一之解决方法、至欲變更阿比西尼亞之政制、則國聯會當有權力以爲之云、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（羅馬）聞英意談話中、首相墨索里尼曾向英國不管部大臣艾登表示、關於各項國際問題、意大利始終保持共同解决不可分離之觀念、至於英德海軍協定、意國雖認爲係一種旣成事實、但對於英國所採取之程序、仍當提出保留、又二月三日英法倫敦宣言書所載各項、除德國重返國聯會一節外、均經艾登與墨索里尼逐項加以討論、關於東歐公約問題墨索里尼曾表示、在大體上加以贊成但此公約對於一般政策所可引起之後果、則加以保留、此外墨索里尼則表示多瑙河公約極關重要、彼仍將進行籌備羅馬九國會議云、關於阿比西尼亞問題、則據官方聲明、艾登並未携　任何建議、但聞艾登表示、英國倘出面干涉、與意國以適當之利益、俾避免軍事行動、此舉當屬有益、墨索里尼則答稱、阿比西尼亞事件、不應專就最近發生之事變、以謀解决而須謀整個問題之解决云、（二十五日哈瓦斯）</p>
<p>（羅馬）意國外交次長蘇維志今日於艾登及墨索里尼談話後向美聯社記者發表談話如下、「吾人確信意國在阿比西尼亞之使命在於廢止奴隸制度、並在加拉·西大馬·及索馬里諸區內設立有秩序之民治政府、以代軍人之壓迫、吾人將使阿比西尼亞自身亦有機會可以參加此項計割、而意國亦擬完全保障英國在阿之利益、故意國之舉動應爲全世界所歡迎」云、按艾登與墨索里尼之談話、結果如何、官方公報頗爲浮泛、茲蘇氏已公公公然坦白發表意國之意見、據此間消息、艾登對於阿比西尼亞問題已讓步不少、以期意國放棄對於英德海軍協定之保留計劃、惟可靠方面仍稱、意國尚無正式决定、對阿備戰亦正繼續進行云、（二十五日國民電）</p>

<p>申報國貨週刊夏令與國貨  玄萬　　氣候是快盛夏了，時代的輪子，推動得眞快，我們看火一般的驕陽，炎暑已在侵襲到每個人們的身上，街頭的摩登女子，更又早穿起什麽舶來的時髦紗，裸着玉趾，套上外國革履，招搖過市，可見得洋貨夏令衣料川品的充斥在我國市塲上，又疋是降臨了一個猖獗傾銷的　節。　　在這時候，我想大家總都能很淸浙地明瞭吧！從過去事實的照示，已吿訴我們夏令中一切洋貨物品的推銷，在歷年來我國整個的入超紀錄上，是佔着如何重要的位置，尤其是像禮和的汗衫，安住的蚊香，美國的汽水，鮮橘水等，據說無論在我國各處，都有着一種牢不可破的潛勢力，說來正堪痛心，而於現下，我們負有提倡國貨責任的人們，該如何努力設法使大家都認淸目標，抱非國貨不買的本旨，去拒用洋貨，挽回權利，和勗促各國貨工廠自身，應如何精益求精，極力把出品美觀，售價低廉，去貢獻給社會，自都成了我們在夏令國貨前途，最急迫的任務和使命。　　不過，提倡國貨，這本是人人的天職，際此國貨呼聲高唱入雲的時候，也無用那些老生常談的說法，在這裏，我只要請大家注意一點時光的消逝委實太快，學生國貨年不早己滑去了他二分之一的日子嗎？我們看顯著的成績，一些也沒有，經濟的國難，却在一天天地加深，最近來滬上金融界的動盪不安，工商界的極度衰蔽，究其主因，不都是因於歷年來龐大入超的所賜嗎？何况，近來華北問題的嚴重性，把我們周身的血液快沸騰起來，種種的刺激，吿訴我們只有咬緊牙關，首先去服用國貨，從這一個强有力的運動上，來盡一點做國民的責任，救國家也就是救了自己呢！　　最後，我再熱烈的希望，願大家都快跟寒暑表上水銀的升高而把愛用國貨的心，也正比例地高上來，要抱多用一分國貨，少用一分洋貨，就是多替國家增加一分元氣的精神，給崇拜洋貨心理者一個重大的轉變，並永遠保持着這種熱度，無論在春天，秋天，或是冬天，因為，我們是中國人，應當用中國貨呀！發展國貨的兩條新路綫  肖白　　在不景氣狂潮的激盪下，我國的整個市塲，顯現得更惡劣起來，工商凋敝，農村破產，歷年來龐大入超的結果，商推銷辦法、已有數處，簽訂經銷合同，將來逐前發展，使成全國產銷合作之網，自不待言。　　二，國貨擴展海外的新計劃：最近滬上各國貨廠商戚於發展國外貿易，可以挽回一部的入超，所以組織中華工業國外貿易協會，積極進行此項新計劃，現聞國際貿易局已允給予很大的贊助，將直接介紹與英美商人，不再由洋行代辦，而南洋一帶，自尤爲我們目下唯一的目標，因爲在那裏，華僑愛護祖國的心切，非常歡迎國貨，可以易於着手進行的。　　最後，我更以極大的熱忱，就是希望政府迅速遵行前幾次的討論和議决，明令裁撤轉口稅與出口稅，以利國貨在上述條的路綫上，可以更快的前進，而整個經濟的危機，也可早日解除，想賢明的當局，一定不會給我們以失望的吧！各國服用國貨的寫真  汪瘦秋　　首都各界提倡國貨委員會，最近草了一篇吿全市同學書，預備日內散發給全市學生，那裏向有各國提倡國貨的情形，很可以使學生們知道愛護國貨是國人的天職。所以我特地把原文介紹給本刊的讀者們。　　全市同學們！提倡國貨，是國民應盡的義務，尤其是一般靑年學生所應負的責任，國民竟給了我們這樣嚴酷的局面，經濟侵略的鞭子，已打得我們體無完膚果然，明白的人，是在幾年前早已料到洋貨的源源進口，我國必有這般慘象的降臨，但是，一般醉生夢死的人們，恐怕到現在還是倒在崇拜洋貨的懷裏『快要葬送他的一切呢！　　還在萌芽時代的我國國貨工業，於這種嚴重的局勢下，因了客觀環境的阻撓，自然使他不能繁榮與滋長，可是，歷史的啟示，國貨運動是已漸漸深入我整個民族的自覺，同時國貨廠商自身的努力，年來埋頭苦幹，不求聲譽，在荊棘發生的道上，大踏步前進，却也確有許多差堪自慰的功績，足以使我們更鼓起勇氣邁進，尤其像最近一方面注意邊陲省區的鉗售，一方面計及海外市塲的開拓，這二條發展國貨的路綫，實爲留心國貨的人們，不可不注意，現在我把他寫在下面，作爲我們益自勵勉，向這兩個最正確的動向，努力奮鬥的意思。　　一，國貨推銷內地的新展開：因爲我國幅員的廣大，過去內地國貨承銷機關的缺乏，致坐使洋貨到處傾銷，無孔不入，所以，在最近來國貨界努力推銷的內地的趨，使深入民間，這是十分正確的動向，現聞我邊陲各省區民衆，也自國貨宣傳團體分往展覽後，增高愛護國貨心不少，而陝西，山西，甘肅，四川，雲南等省各大城市中，除國貨公司紛紛成立，已由計劃而到實踐的階段外，當地商界，又都與本埠國貨廠商洽經濟的　虧，金視國產暢銷與否爲轉移。吾國經濟　後，　　破產，提倡國貨，更屬刻不容緩的事，現在目把其他國家提倡國貨的情形寫在下面，做們的參考。　　（一）英國　他們組織愛國聯合會；發起購用國貨週；勸用國貨。此外又發起了購買國貨運動週，國產棉布週等等。　　（二）德國　他們認　愛用國貨的，才是國中的優秀份子，他們的誡言是：甲·不要把外國貨的食品，放在你桌上。乙·德國造的紙，要用德國造的筆和墨水來寫，並且要用德國的吸墨紙。丙·眞正給我們德人精力的，只有德國麫粉果實和啤酒。丁·假使你不歡喜喝德國咖啡，你可以喝德國殖民地的咖啡。戊·你應當穿德國的布，戴德國的帽子。　　（三）法國　他們對於外國貨，像罐頭食品等，强制註明原來出產國的國名，對於麫包原料，强制用國產小麥。　　（四）比國　他們因爲擁護法郎，法幣名稱的價格，特創設比利時法郎日，法郎擁護聯盟的宣傳標語上，有幾句話，說：你的祖國是比利時，你必定要和你的祖國共生共死，你要節儉，要愛用國貨，不要浪費。　　（五）丹麥　他們每逢星期日就定爲丹麥日，竭力的宣傳使用國貨，而且張貼很多的國貨商標於公共塲所或來往要道，以示分別。　　（六）挪威　他們積極的獎勵使用國貨，凡是公共塲所，不許張貼外國貨的廣吿。　　（七）日本　他們對於國貨運動，更是緊張，任何的國家，都比不上他們，國民愛護國貨，比自己的生命還看得更重。　　在這生存競爭的潮流中，各國都設法充分推銷國貨，爲國家開財源，以求生存。吾人値此艱難危急之秋，　如何深自警惕？同學們！覺悟吧！快覺悟吧！不要把大好的國家，爲好用漂亮的外國貨斷送了！我們如果有良心的，不要再買一個錢的外國貨，尤希望女同學們，不要使用外國的化妝品，須知道這類化妝品的輸人，每年値（最高額）萬四千一百七十四萬國幣，這筆數字，多麼可驚啊！同學們！快快起來努力國貨運動，實行服用國貨不購外貨的信條。從美亞累絲紗想到入超  吟芳　　累絲紗是一種樓空而很飄逸的夏季衣料，與普通的綢縐，織法完全不同，牠的樣子，與縷空花邊相彷彿。不過普通的花邊是用紗綫製造，而衣料的累絲紗，却是用絲綫在織機上織造，中國人對於紗綫的花邊，向來用手工編織的是很多，而對於衣料的累絲紗，却一向沒有人能織，完全是技術的問題。　　卽如絲絨一物，以前中國任何綢廠都不會做，自從去年美亞織綢廠開始製織以後，風行一時，洋貨的絲絨，便沒有人過問了。今年該廠又把織造累絲紗的方法，研究完成，所以近日見報載已有美亞累絲紗上市，日前至南京路中國國貨公司參觀，見其質料和花樣，與舶來品比較，不相上下，售價當然比舶來品便宜得多了。　　這雖是織綢業中一小部份的發明，但是我想中國人的腦筋，並不是笨拙，只要肯多用些腦筋，任何東西，都可以發明製先造，國人自然愛用，舶來品自然可以淘汰，入超自然可以逐漸减少。　　有人說像這種累絲紗，太摩登，太奢華，何必去發明製造呢？但是要知道許多中國的摩登小姐太太，對於這種衣料，她們是認爲很需要，常常在購買洋貨，與其任她們購買洋貨，反不如用中國的絲，中國的人工，也做出這樣高貴的衣料，滿足她們的需要，至少也可以减少一部漏巵。所以我以爲國貨製造，什麼品質都可以發明，减少漏巵總是一件可喜的事情啊！介紹光陸油漆  天和　　歐風東漸，百業維新，惟油漆業墨守成章，不事改良生產，以致供不應求，舶來品人造漆乃乘虛而入，每歲巵漏數足驚人，近歲以來，國人雖急起直追，竭力研求，始知利用機械，以科學方法煉製；是以出品日見精進，而國人亦樂於提倡，至現在已成爲不可少之工業矣。　　光陸造漆公司，爲人造漆業後起之生力軍，當此不景氣瀰漫全國之時，不畏艱難，悉心製造，問世於今，未及兩月，而出品已風行全國，內外皆碑載道。設非經理得人，曷亟臻此？該廠經理陸君聯芳，年方二十五歲，浙之蘭谿人，少年英俊，鑑定油漆爲將來工業發展之一，置身其間，期已十載。對於製銷情形，靡不加以深切之研究。嗣於一二八後首創萬里漆油廠，自任經理，盡其心得，擘劃經營，不二年成效卓著。旋於去年間因與一部份股束意見相左，將其心血締造而成之事業，毅然放棄，而先生並不以此氣餒，乃重行集資，再接再厲，組織光陸造漆公司，費時數月，始底於成，事無巨細，莫不躬親，不願假手於人。而對於製造方面，更爲認眞，不肯草率從事，是以出品優異，堪與舶來品相抗衡，誠工業界不可多得之人才也。貢獻話只要一顆良心  仰葊　　最近某金融領袖自華北歸，道經濟南，參觀濟南中國國貨公司，見其營業尚發達，某君因問經理，魯省外貨傾銷，何以尚有國貨地位？而貴公司貨品，尚有這許多銷塲？某經理說：誠然，外貨價値之賤，匪伊所思，無如魯人寗使來購國貨，對於賤價之貨，望望然去之，此中究何因綠，吾人推測所及，或者山東人個個尚還有一顆愛國心，換言之，人人還存一顆良心耳。　　這一段話，不由地使人感動至於十二萬分，認爲，國不亡之原因，千鈞一髮，或卽在此。中國一綫之希望，或卽在此。　　一個人不講情理起來，無所不用其極。不許你說抵制，不容你譓提倡，沒一有理智的黑暗世界，也許要有這一慕。可是能不能說不許你有愛國心，不容你有良心，也許人家說得出。可是事實上你能做到麽？「吾是中國人，我愛中國貨。」「我是有國格人格的國民，吾不肯汨沒我的一顆良心。」海可枯，石可爛，無論如何，我們一顆愛用國貨的良心，終究是和我們民族的生命，掙扎下去，沒有熄滅的一天。為難  鼎華　　女兒　爸爸，今年是學生國貨年，我要做幾件漂亮的國貨衣服　　父親　咦！昨天不是伴你去買了許多衣料嗎？　　女兒　那些都是外國貨啊！　　父親　你說是去年做的就是啦！　　女兒　不，去年是婦女國貨年國！　　父親　那麽你說是你媽改的萬衣服。　　女兒　不行，這料子太新了，一看就看得出的呀！　　父親　那麽這樣吧，明天呌吳媽到鄉下去帶些灰色土布出來吧　　女兒　我不要，我不要，那太難看了！老太婆穿的！　　父親　××××一週間國貨新訊　　上海市商會代表大會，議决請政府統制進口貿易，管理國際匯兌以杜入超。　　鐵道部四屆鐵展會十月十日在靑島開會，各地工廠均有出品赴會。　　湖南中國國貨公司董事長譚常愷來滬，接洽推銷國貨事。　　中華國貨廠商聯合會生辦之滬北區國貨展覽會，定七月一日開幕，各廠均已籤定場位。　　昆明中國國貨公司定下月中開幕，副經理姚星墅，已來滬運貨。　　中華國貨產銷合作協會，定六月二十八日舉行年會。　　中華國貨協社，於六月二十四日開成立會，選定理事監事。　　出口草帽業公會，於六月二十四日成立。　　學生國貨年高橋區展覽會，於六月二十三日開幕。　　中華糖業公司，專事推銷國產食糖。　　上海工商業貸欵委員會，業已成立，辦事處設在中國國貨銀行，國貨工廠商號，得向該會申請借欵，審查合格，卽通知銀錢業放欵。　　學生國貨年推行會，督促各國貨紙廠研究製造敎科書用書，聞龍章紙廠已研究完成第一批出貨，已駕乎舶來品之上。夏夜的夢  凌雲　　接連幾晚，國華沒有好好地睏覺，因爲蚊子已經在發動了。　　爲了夜晚睡眠不充足，日間辦事便感覺到精神困倦；所以國華就到五洲藥房去買了兩盒地球牌國貨殺蚊香。　　晚上就寢的時候，把蚊香燃起來，果然耳邊再聽不見「嗡嗡：」的聲音，身上也再沒有被可得痛權了：於是國華便得安然的入夢了。　　恍惚中國華忽然看見眼前飛來許多蚊蟲，這些蚊蟲身軀雖然倭小，但是牠們的長嘴却顯得非常尖利，並且牠們的肚子都是脹得圓圓的，是像剛剛吸飽了人們的血液。這些惡蚊正在空中高興地舞着唱着的時候，突然從下而冒上來一陣濃烟，這些惡蚊都被薰得很狼狽；不過牠們還是張着牠們的利嘴，像是要橫行到底。但是下面的濃烟越冒越多了，這些惡蚊招架不住，最後都從空中跌到地上死了！這時候國華又看見湧上來的濃烟幾成兩行字：「侵略人的結果」「國貨勝利萬歲……」　　國華從這樣一個夢境中醒來，自己安然地睡在床上，耳邊再

<p>春秋點滴  （片月）　　走進高等娛樂塲所，在游藝開始以前聽到的，只是聚成輕雷一般的喁喁低語聲、十足表示所有未到此地的人莫不文明知禮；你抉沒有勇氣用你平常習慣的聲浪的高度，只得格外抑低了和你的同伴講話。或者你不願裝這鬼鬼祟祟的談話態度，你只有减少說話的次數，力守緘默。誰說娛樂决不是苦事？　　女子預備做人家妻子的時候，很希望嫁一個頂天立地的丈夫。女子已經做了人家的妻子，差不多無不希望伊丈夫做官和發財，却絕不想到丈夫做官或發財的成因，最足毀滅他一生的人格，並且他做官或發財了，轉眼就要拋撇你！廣播無綫電中的歌女  范　　無綫電廣播事業，在上海可稱發達到了極點。廣播電台約有四五十所，至於收音機，則其數目有人估計當在十萬具以上，現在中上之家，差不多家家有那麽一只收音機了。因廣播事業的發達，却因此產生了不少的新與的職業，如現在各處大量產生的歌唱團體，便是其一。　　我們在收音機畔，聽歌女們的嬌音婉轉，每爲神往，以爲歌女們的生活，一定優遊舒適，伊們的風姿，一定楚楚動人，那知事實適得其反，據一位熟識內幕情形者講；現在除有一二個時髦的歌星外，其他歌女薪給，每月大都在十元以下，四五元一月的也很多，更有些爲了愛出錄頭來白盡義務歌唱的少女也不少。不過前者每天應按時而到，偶有誤點，必受斥罵；後者則可來可不來，不受歌唱團的拘束。至於風姿，因無綫電中祗求歌喉動聽，品貌在所不計，所以倒極其隨便的，有幾位歌女還只有十二二歲哩。　　因歌女的收入很微薄，所以生活方面，流露着窘困；住的是亭子間，吃的是豆腐靑菜，行的是靠自己兩只脚，雖在雨天，也擎着傘，穿了皮鞋而來。伊們的家庭，大都貧苦，其中也有無力升學的女學生，但伊們的職業，均極爲家庭所反對，差不多成爲一般的現象了。　　我以爲歌女雖則爲職業之一，但其供獻於社會的，實甚微薄，除供給資產階級娛樂之外，有什麽足以值得稱頌的呢？所以我敢以至誠，在這裏附帶勸告一般學齡時代的少女，你們應當認識時代，別把可貴的前途斷送了，應當尋覓你們人生的大道。金魚一夕談  鄭逸梅　　海上人士、頗多碧藻朱鱗之好，陳君渚深其一也。昨晚陳君宴癖魚同志於大西洋菜館，予亦忝陪末座，因得聆吳吉人，邱良玉，鄭正秋小秋賢喬梓，朱大可，薛壽齡，張夢周諸子蓄魚有得之談，異常有味，愛拉雜記之，以告世之喜養金魚者。　　金魚以換水失時，動輒爛及鱗體，若取來沙耳藥液塗之，痊愈甚速。惟藥性烈，宜大魚而不宜雛鱗，著於雛鱗，反促之立死。　　魚鱗作珠粒狀者，曰：「珍珠魚」，名種也，然大都以紅黑者爲多，其他則罕見，陳君渚深蒂魚多，珍珠魚各色乃俱備，洋洋大觀，歎爲難得。　　置金魚於噴水池中，則潛浮活動，甚易長成，養一二年，其巨可敵三四年者，但鱗之色澤，不及尋常之饒有光彩，亦一憾事。　　魚之較大者，若不得水蛆充食，動輒吞噬最小之魚，同類相殘，異常酷忍，飼之者不可不注意也。　　炙金魚成灰，研之爲未，可治黃疽及水　，有奇效。　　天寒時，蓄魚者以便於誰視計，往往合若干缸爲一缸，實貝此舉乃大謬，魚於冬殘春動之際，爲其交尾之唯一時期，種類難置，將來所產之魚，什九變種，反致名種斷絕，故此時最宜分蓄，不使混淆。　　繼種雖多變佳爲劣，然有時亦能產生不可名狀之魚，好奇者正不妨姑將一二名種爲犧牲品，與尋常之魚，雜置一缸，以試騐之。　　渚深吉人諸子，擬聯絡蓄魚同志，爲一大規模之集團，屬予命名，並撰緣起，予不獲辭，稍暇當有以報命也。賣粢飯者  朱瘦桐　　在那冷僻的街頭，擺設賣粢飯攤頭的小販，每當炊姻四起，已近落市的當兒，他便收拾了破舊傢伙，挑着急匆匆的回去了。　　他是寄居在距離我家不遠的一個灶披間裏。他的往來，必須經過我家的門口，積久，同我們的傭人，也都相熟了，所以每逢這賣粢飯的走過，總聽到他們互相說笑的聲音；有時我偶然在外面閒散，同他碰見了，他也照呼了一聲，並也連說了一些天寒天熱的敷衍客套，看見他瘦削的面孔上面，微露着不自然的苦笑，頓時使我心坎中間，感受着一些不安起來。　　他出入的時間，好像一隻凖確的時計，可以說聲一點沒有參差，我們的傭人，望見了他迎面走來，倘然還沒有燒飯，總說着：那個賣粢飯的也回來了，我們要幹快一點哩。　　靠着蠅利來解决一家幾口的生活問題，已是很不容易的事情，不料這克勤克儉的小販，爲了天氣的關係，粢飯的銷路受着極大的打擊，近幾天來，老是見他挑了冒着熱氣的担子，踏着沉重的脚步回來，靜悄悄一點聲息也沒有了。　　孩子們一眼望見他們的父親，担着賣剩的棻飯回來，喜歡得很，大家都伸着小手，吵着要吃。做父親的因爲生意不好，正愁着怎樣的度日，恰巧這些可憐的小生命又是一陣亂嚷，不由地心中冒起火來，便舉起手掌就在孩子的身上，使勁的打了幾下，于是孩子便都大哭起來。　　這種哭聲，每當飄進我的耳中，我總暗自想着；做父親的小販，也當寬恕這些孩子們的啊。沒有使他們吃飽肚子，怎能怪他們吵鬧呢？。  憶秋　　妹想思，妹想思，不作風流待幾時？只見風吹花落地，不見風吹花上枝　御香縹緲錄  淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯　　有了這種種的便利，有時我竟能使伊安靜起來，忘却伊所有的一切憂憤和鬱怒。就爲着這們緣故，這天我雖並不輪在值上，伊也要來召我了。我奉了這諭旨自然是萬萬不能違拒的，便忽忽地冒着雨，趕到伊的寢宮中去。一走進門，少不得先要照着規矩向伊　頭，伊也照例的敎我站了起來。……接着，却又發出了一憫很特別的命令。　　「德齡，走近前來，把你的手掌攪在我的額上」！伊很鄭重地說道：「試試看，我有沒有發熱」？　　伊這時候的態度，眞是非常的嚴厲焦躁，我想那時候我的手腕也不免有些抖了，可是我不能因害怕而抗旨，只得大着膽，伸過手去，撫摩着伊的高貴的皮膚。其實一來我旣不曾學過翳，二來又因我的年紀還小，經騐不多，對於人的體溫的高度，究竟應該有多少，實無半此確切的知識。雖然如此，我的觸覺還不致完全無用，祇把我的手掌在伊額上覆了四五秒鐘，我就知道伊的確有些發熱了。　　「是的，老佛爺」，我低聲回奏道，「果然有些發熱」。　　至於伊的咳嗽呢，那是不容我再試騐的了，因爲自我進來之後，一直聽伊不停的在嗽着，使伊非常的煩惱。但我一時也無法消除它。其時那總管太監李蓮英也在旁邊，他顯然是很關心着太后的健康的，不過他也沒有什麼辦法，只能堆着一臉的媚笑，站在旁（三五〇）小西天  張恨水著　　第十五回　苦口婆心不平空拍案錢聲燈影可憐正賣人　　北海道：程先生上次曾勸過他們一回，他們是很接受的。趁着這個時候，他們還沒有接洽成功，呌了那個胡小脚來，再勸他幾句，勸他不要爲了暫時多兩個人吃飯，拆散人家的骨肉。他聽與不聽，我們那是不知道，不過我們總也盡了我們的最後忠告。志前道，倒也無所不可。只是我們派茶房去請他來，那又是太顯着痕跡了。北海說着話的時候，也已慢慢的在椅子上坐下，這時又忽然的站起來，點頭挺胸的道：我去我去！而且我去了，他還是一定會來。志前笑着向他道：那也好。北海在一點頭緒沒有的時候，忽然得了這個機會，很是歡喜，掉轉身就向後去了。志前隔了窗子望着，見他走路的時候，臉上就帶着很深的笑容。自己也就笑着點點頭，接上還歏了一口氣。果然，還不到十分點的時問，北海就引着胡嫂子來了。這時天色已然昏暗，茶房在廊子外棒了媒油燈向屋子走來，見胡嫂子走了來，他就在窗子外站着，沒有進來。那意思是可以不言而喻，無非是避嫌疑。胡嫂子跟着北海進　了，還是那老樣子，一跨過房門，手就扶了墻站定，笑道：這位王先生說，程老爺呌我有話說嗎？志前想了一想，望着北海笑道：對了，王先生自己當了一回茶房，把你請來了。你坐着，我們談談。胡嫂子坐下，志前道：我們是多事，並非有什麼要緊的事和你商量。據我們所聽到說的，那朱家姑娘的事已經妥了（二五〇）拉雜話關於自殺  吳雅非　　關於自殺風潮的澎湃，近來幾乎達到了白熱化的稈度，在早前，自殺不過一個人二個人；現在却全家覆沒，不留一口的乾脆死—個乾凈。記得前幾年胃有一位叫衛延殘的，他因窮途落魄，生機斷絕而率領全家渡浦蹈海自殺。結果妻子兒女都死了，他自己却給救了起來。可是他這樣的人生，這樣的身世，徒然留得這一個憂患餘生的臭皮囊還有些什麽意義？所以他終於在隔了不多時候，仍舊用殘酷的手段來結束了他不幸的生命，後來父有申報館秦理齋先生的遺族也全家服了毒，不過他們却不是簡單的爲了經濟，而另有情感作用的。　　最近我們翻開報紙來，每天總可以看見幾條關於自殺的新聞；並且自殺者大都是有能爲智識的靑年，而其自殺的原因亦不外乎經濟壓迫，失業無告。雖然也有幾個是爲情犧牲或受了其他刺激的，但是究竟是少數中的少數，而且其根本原因還是爲了金錢作祟！　　咳！「人生不幸而生於斯世」！現在不但是多事之秋，而且還是我們靑年的多難之時，我們要想在這不合理的現社會上找得一條出路眞是難若登天，所以在每一個靑年入的心里，都同樣的感到自已前途的暗澹。於是那抱悲觀主義者，便毅然地下了赴死的决心，可是　總覺得他們的遭遇固然可憐，然而他們的行爲却未免太慘酷了吧！他們自己死了怕不乾，必欲呌若妻，若母，若子女等同時毀滅，這在人道上講，也好像有些說不過去；雖然伊們就是生着亦是無法朮生，早晚還是難免一死的，但是我相信只要能够奮鬥，總可以找得綫曙光來。　　我對於生，雖亦並不感到興趣，可是我覺得這樣無勇氣的去自殺亦不見得有味，所以我始終不贊成一個人用最殘忍，最慘酷的手段來結束自己的生命，縱然到了不能生的時候，也祗讓它自然的毀滅，尤其是那些全家自殺，使我想起來就有些戰慄的！　　人生本來是乏味的，苦痛的，要想求得一些幸福與安慰，是何等的渺茫！一個人一生儘在黑暗中掙扎，等到跳出這黑暗的圈子而想踏進光明里的時候，生命却開始將要幻減了。</p>

<p>自由談雨果的人道主義  王集叢　　被稱爲法國文學「永世之父」的雨果，今年六月恰爲其逝世五十周紀念。歐洲和日本，都有盛大的祭典舉行，以紀念這位法國浪漫主義的巨魁。講釗法國浪漫主義，集於那旗幟下的作家，出現了兩種在本質上不同的典型：一種是與沒落的貴族相聯結的，如維尼，繆塞，喬治桑；另一種則是反對貴族的，其代表便是我們所要在此談論的雨果。但是雨果不僅是反貴族的浪漫主義的首要，而且是人道主義者。他曾努力反對過死刑，爲了「人道」，在他底一切著作中，對於被壓迫者，對於貧苦的人類，雖都給與了無限的同情，但結果除勸人爲善外，並沒有明白地給大家指示出一條在實際上走得通的道路。他不管社會發展的動力是什麼，人類生活競爭的實質如何，他只是站在人道主義的旗下，希望强者愛護弱者，希望富豪憐惜貧窮，希望惡人爲善。在「秋之葉」中，他曾勸告富豪們道：「要常常使貧窮人在諸君門口的階砌前面愉快地放出喜色，而能在此看得出避難所的親切和愛護來罷」。他在「市會議事堂的舞蹈會」中「向着官廳訴說：應當使貧窮絕根，以使一切的人都幸福」。在長篇小說「發笑人」中，他曾借着丑角化了的曾爲貴族的主人公君卜郎的嘴向貴族富豪們說：「應當要悲憐那些被害的人們，帮助那些貧困者」。——所有這些，都可以充分表現出偉大作家雨果底人道主義的精神。　　維克多爾·雨果底最有名的作品，不消說是「悲慘世界」；但在他底諸著作中，人道主義的色彩最濃厚的，恐怕也就是這「悲慘世界」。他在這有名作品底序文中說：「因爲法律和習慣，現今有一種社會的處刑存在，在文明中心的地上，人爲地造出了一種地獄，一切災厄使神聖的運命發生糾紛；現代的三大問題，——因貧困而墮落的男子，因飢餓而淪落的女子，及因精神肉體的不幸而發育不全的孩子，——尙未解决；某方面的社會，瀕於窒息，從廣義的見地看來，無智和悲慘，還在世界上存在；——在以上的社會狀態之下，這樣的書，是不會沒用的。」這樣看來，雨果底「悲慘世界」，是爲了要說明並解决當時社會所存在的那「三大問題」而寫的，但在這中間，他並沒有深入到問題底根底，並沒有找出那些問題發生的根本原因，從而也就沒有透露出解决問題的實際辦法了。對於戰爭底殘酷，對於當時的法律底不合情理，對於修道院中一般禁慾主義者底虛僞，他在這偉大的作品中都眞實地生動地描畫了出來，但他並不主張以實際的行動來解决這些問題；他底中心意識是勸人爲善，好像善行便可以解决一切問題似的。事實上，他所努力描寫的這小說的主人公强乏爾强原來是一個作惡的偷兒，後來在「上帝一般仁慈的」僧正米利哀底「德行」的感化之下，竟自改變成爲一個勤苦努力的善人，而且成爲了「善良的」富翁；他救濟賣淫的女子，將自己底財產分給窮人，對於被擒的仇人的「報仇」，他是將之釋放：像這樣地描寫和讚揚改惡爲善的人道主義的精神，的確是可以與宗敎家托爾斯泰相比的。　　但是，雨果是法國浪漫主義的首要，不是寫實主義的小說作家，其人道主義不消說是穿着浪漫主義的彩衣的。同時，他還是反對貴族的小市民的作家，所以他底人道主義又是小市民性的，他愛自由，尊重人權，爲此他不僅寫了許多著作，而月還實際地去參加政治運動。就拿他底「悲慘世界」來訛吧，其中的企業家是由作惡的偷兒奮鬬出來的，他不榨取勞苦的人羣，他是作勞苦的人羣底「生父」，他是以救人愛人爲其唯一責任的：這樣的企業家，便是從人道主義的小市民底理想中產生出來的；此種理想的企業家，雖不存在於現實世界中，但那些實際存在的企業家，也未嘗不以其「善行」來誇耀他們底「德行」，來作炫惑別人的幌子。蘭生曾說「悲慘世界」是「和私利的市民，被欺負被壓榨的苦惱的人們，交際塲中人們的惡德，及落伍者徒刑囚賣春婦的美德等等正面接觸時所產生的人道主義的民主主義的詩」。——這在某一點上說來，我以爲是對「悲慘世界」的適當的評判。　　一八七一年巴黎發生了歷史上偉大的事變時，雨果正在比京，他對這個事變是表示反對的，及至事變失敗，參加這事變的人們大遭屠殺時，他又對這種屠殺表示不滿，積極運動對於參加事變的人們的大赦。在這個事件中，他底熊度的改變，也是可以表現出他底憎惡賤忍，愛護人類的善良的心的；但最後說來，他底這種善良的心，在保護當時法國的市民社會底存在一點上，仍是有益的。　　「表同情於壓迫者，雖賢者亦要變成愚人」。所謂「人道主」便是在表面上同情於被壓迫的人羣而憎惡壓迫者的，因之其中也包含着一部分的眞理。雨果雖然沒有提出有效的辦法來解决他所看出的問題，其浪漫主義的人道主義，雖然是小市民性的，是在客觀上有益於企業家的，但因其眞實地描寫了他所看出的那些不合理的社會現象，勇敢地提出了那些社會問題，對於「被欺負被壓榨的苦惱的人們」給與了眞誠的偉大的同情，所以，他底一切作品仍能使人發生很大的感動，仍能使人流淚，因而仍是具有偉大價值的藝術品。如果他底人道主義的解决問題的辦法之橫存於其作品中，是多少傷害了他底作品底價值的，那麼，他爲了要增强其人道主義底效用而對於許多社會現象的眞實的描寫，對於那些「被欺負被壓榨的苦惱的人們」的眞誠的偉大的同情，便是他底作品所以有偉大的藝術價值的原因。中街風味  斐兒　　新加坡印象記之一　　每天，蟄伏在一家高樓上。把一領蓆子做椅，一隻櫈子做檯，我翻開書來，或在一本練習簿子上寫下了橫行的字跡。早晨，中午，和黃昏，廚子一聲呼號，便加入在一只大圓棹子旁邊，自己洗好了碗和筷，參加了十幾個人一桌的飯食。在店前，接連幾十間的，浮起了貨價的論爭，和貨車的狂號。店子後面，貨棧的苦力們騰起了熱騰騰的汗汁，和有力的吼聲。前後左右：是秤，是口沫，是汗汁，是金錢的響聲。……　　去萊佛士圖書館，或從圖書館回來，我蟄伏在一家高樓上。四而儘是市聲，是喧囂和熱呌。　　整個的中街有成十家咖啡店，每日騰着熱騰騰的咖啡的煙，和冷冰冰的冰水的煙，抱着一本書，從熱哄哄的談笑中可以冷靜地看到各式各樣人的臉孔，各式各樣人談話的題材和姿態。這里暴露着生活的各面；這里埋藏着絕好的文章資料。年少的店東們告訴我以獵艷的羅曼斯，中年的夥計們連連地向我訴着苦衷，苦力們向我做健壯的笑，有時用拳頭拍着桌子發出激昂的句子。剛從故國來的舊友們訴說着桑梓的故事向我搖頭，老僑的新友向我嘆息着僑胞的厄運。……　　向西通過去是萊佛士廣場，停下了大幫的漂亮的汽車，銀行和祥行高揚起高高的額角。向東到中街路口，老「巴塞」里有咖唎牛肉飯，在熱騰騰的姻氣中夾擠着生命的嘆息和苦笑。再從此東行，有海。有輪船，有海的怒號；有水花，也有流浪人的淚珠。　　夜晚，熱哄哄的中街已是死去，喝醉酒的已歸來，獵艷者也歸來，耳畔是巨大的鼾聲，或碎碎地談着夜話。夜，向下沈澱，向下死寂。熱帶吹起秋風，在樓頂地板上，每領紅氈捲着每個像死屍般的身體。　　從這里聽到東北方砲火的響聲，也從這里嗅到民族向下低沈的氣息。　　竭力從中街拔出來，投向檳榔嶼，却又被拋入大洋，捲回故國。中街的印象至今並不曾冷淡下來。診  周文　　病實在拖得太久了，終於下了一個最大的抉心，由雲陪着我往一個大的醫院去。下了黃包車跨進大門的時候，我又和雲爭論起來：　　「雲，你一定也檢查一下，不要再那樣固執了吧。」　　雲曲着五指掠一掠耳邊的長疑髮，笑一笑，說：　　「算了，你又講，我們不是只有這幾個錢了麽？我的身體並不壞，你別擔心我眞的就受了傳染。」　　「不，你這幾天的痰也多了，飯也少吃了，你一定要……」　　我還沒有說完，雲把嘴唇一嘟，就掉過頭去。　　「你看，不是麼，一說，你的脾氣就來了，這就是肺病的徵候。」我拍着她肩頭說。　　幸而出乎我們意料之外的是，普通號只要一角大洋。送了一張兩角的鈔票到掛有一塊、「掛號處」牌子的櫃台上，我的手裏便有了兩張四方形印有鉛字的白卡片：「肺病診券」。雲也不再說甚麽，而旦抿着嘴唇，笑了。　　肺病診室的門外，靠欄杆邊，巳經有兩個也是拿着四方形白卡片的蒼白臉瘦子在那兒站住，頭一點一點地咳嗆着，臉色就顯得更加蒼白；引得我也喉癢癢地咳了一聲。他兩個一驚地掉轉頭來見我同雲站在門口，立刻皺着眉，把臉沉下來，離開關杆，搶着擠到門口來了，而日橫着眼睛就白了我們一眼。幸而診室門呀的一聲開了，一個後腦勺上戴着一塊畚箕形的白布的女看護，昂着頭一連喊了三個號數；我拿起卡片來一看，有我的，我們也就跟着走進去。　　是一個大房間，有兩個病人正站在兩個房角的檯子前穿衣服，兩個穿白布外套的醫生正伏在檯上，向着白紙上畫動着手上的鋼筆。當我們走攏去的時候，那左邊的一個醫生，忽然站起來，把一張寫了許多外國字的紙遞給他面前穿好了衣服的病人，發着沙沙的聲音說道：　　「你照×光，今天就好照。不要再拖延了呀，你這病是……」　　雲忽然扯我的袖子一下，說：　　「我們到裏面的一間屋子去，那看護說的。」　　「我們剛走到門口，就看見門一開，正走出來一個燙了頭髮的女人，手上拿着一張也是寫滿了外國字的白紙。—哦，原來這間是女的診室。我想。　　一個頭髮油光光的醫生正站在窗邊的檯子面前，兩手插在白布外套的袋子里面，昂着頭，一眼就把雲盯住，點點頭，從我的手上接過那兩張診券去，他便坐下來，拿起鋼筆把診券上的名字照塡到一張白紙上。一會，他又偏着頭，揚着眉毛，兩眼盯着雲，間道：　　「你覺得那些地方不舒服？」　　「我這兩天似乎有痰。」　　「咳嗽不咳嗽？」他忽然把眼睛盯住他乎上玩着的一支紅桿子的自來水鋼筆，那很新的金筆尖上黏着一點甚麽灰塵，他於是一面問，一面伸出一根指尖去擦它。　　「不咳嗽。」　　「吃不吃得？」　　「這兩天！」雲映動着眼睛遲疑了一下。　　醫生尖着嘴唇向筆尖吹一口氣，便搶着問：　　「發熱不發熱？」　　他忽然站起來了，皺着眉看看自己手上的金表，向他面前站着的一個女看護不知說些甚麼，之後，便把兩手挿在外套的袋子里，昂着頭，把眉毛一揚，說道：　　「脫衣服。」　　到了檢查的時候，他好象又並不見得馬虎。他左掌撫在雲赤着的背脊上一移一移的，右手曲着的兩個指頭，就在那左掌背上不斷地敲着，敲一遍又敲一遍，而且還側着耳朶靠近他敲動着的指頭去，至於好幾分鐘之久。　　「她怎樣？」醫生坐回檯子邊的時候，我忍不住地問。他把嘴閉了一會，皺皺眉，才偏着頭說道：　　「肺部不很好。」　　「那怎麽樣的？」　　「我覺得還得再精密的檢查。她的左肺部很…很…很…但是單憑我這樣看看，究竟還不能完全决定，最要緊是照×光，這種病是馬虎不得的。」　　我着急了，問他照×光要多少錢？　　「十六塊。敝院是慈善性質，所以比別家便宜得多。頂好今天就可以照。」　　他說着，就拿着鋼筆在一張白紙上寫了起來，最後的兩個是亞拉伯字的十六。　　最後，是檢查我的身體。當他伸着指頭在我的前胸敲了兩下的時候，他的眼晴忽然又發現他左腕上的金表，皺皺眉，掉頭去望望門口。我正屏住呼吸等他敲敲乳部；但他把聽肺器取出來了，夾在兩耳上，手上拿着管子就在我的背上戳三下。他又皺着眉看看手上的金表，於是把聽肺器裝進袋子里，便向檯子面前走去了。　　「先生，我的怎樣？」當我一面穿衣服的時候，一面着急地問。　　「你的肺部很不好。」他說。恰在這時，門一開，剛才出去的那看護婦又進來了。外面房間那兩個醫生向病人談話的聲音都從她的背後擠了進來！　　「你應該照X光，」　　「你的左肺部不很——」　　門一關，聲音突然又被關出去了。　　我着急地望着醫生同看護把話講完，又問道：　　「我的肺部是怎樣的不好？」　　『是右邊，這裏。」他伸一根指頭向我的胸部指一下。『很不好。我看還是照—」他忽然站了起來，忽忙地喊住那巳經跨出門的看護。說了一句話之後，這纔又坐下來了，繼續說完他的話：　　「你還是照X光。」他看我一眼，見我沒甚麼話，便在另一張紙上寫起來了，最後是兩個亞拉伯字的十六。我有點生氣了，問道：　　「究竟是她的厲害還是我的厲害？」　　「她的厲害。」他的眼睛望着他手上的筆尖，答。「但是你的也厲害。不過只有X光才能檢查的詳細。」他一面說，一面就把兩張寫滿外國字的白紙遞給我，眼睛就望着開了一下的門口——其時正進來一個也是拿着一張四方形白卡片的蒼白臉的瘦子。他立刻從那人的乎上接過卡片去，我們也就只得跨出門來了。「胡師」  胡考作大學時代（十）（二）  德國施托謨著　陳隱之譯　　我還溜跑了好一會，要去替娜麗效勞，但想不出怎樣用最有禮貌的方式去向她提說。因爲每次當我走近去時候，她顯然避開我，並藏身在別人中問。此時那個學徒又推撬回來了。「現在輪到娜麗娜麼了！」有人說這一句；但娜麗不願意坐上去。「巴特爾應當先去喝點東西，」她說，並拿了點錢放在學徒手裏。　　我沒有十分聽淸楚，但我已經把計劃想好了。我裝做若無其事的樣子，盡力向帳慕跑去。將到帳幕時候，弗里茨底母親喊着我。「菲力，」她說，帶點開玩笑神氣，並用犬指向我跑來的那一方面指着，「如果你若捕捉娜麗的話，——她就在那兒！」　　「我當然是要捕捉她的！」我喊，就溜過去了。　　「是的，是的；但她再不願意理會你們這班少爺們了！」　　我聽見這話時巳經跑了很遠了。我巳經站在賣酒的大帳幕前面。不久巴特爾也走到那裏來，，但我早就　盡所有現欵替他買好一杯糖酒和一塊夾有香腸的奶油麵包放在那裏了。一你試　　看，」我把這兩樣東西放在他的面前，「那些小姑娘們使得你太辛苦了！一　　小孩吃着喝着非常有味，因此我敢進一步去誘引他。「巴特爾，我來代替你推一次雪撬，你願意麽？」　　他拿手揩掉額上的汗珠，繼續安靜地咬着麵包；祇是當我把辦法告訴他時候，他才點點頭表示他懂得我的意思。他吃完之後，便回到他那羣人中問去；不久我就看見娜還披着黑綢毛皮頭布，雙手套在她的小手籠內，坐在雪撬裏面，巴特爾笨拙地在湖邊上慢慢推着。——當他們從人羣中衝出去時候，我就溜動我那平滑的溜冰鞋走向他們去。祇一會兒，我的手便放在雪撬上面，那個學徒就留在後而不跟上來了。我快活得要叫喊出來，但我把牙齦咬緊，輕　的雪撬像生了翅膀一樣在閃光的冰面上放射過去。　　「巴特爾，你簡直是飛了！」娜麗說。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言生命的價值  瓊聲　　一般養生家時常說，生命者，有至高無上之價值。個人之生命一旦死亡，一切均卽付諸東流，保出生命，才能談到事業與幸福之類，所謂「留得靑山在，方能有柴燒」是也。於是除了席豐履厚養尊處優之外，還須想盡方法，以求「延年益壽」，甚或搜尋各種還童術」與「海上仙方」，想得一個長生不老。在這部份人看來，生命確乎是具有無上的價值。　　不過這僅小部份人如此，在那種不但不能戚到人生幸福，且覺生之不易的人，便大異其趣。最近仁濟醫院的報告，就揭露出這一潰爛的情形。該報告於叙述該院今年一月至五月自殺者六百三十一人，較去年增加五倍之後，跟着復稱：一人之生命，按市價究值幾何？言之令人可驚。有一壯漢，因失業改營小販，遭遇不利，流爲乞丐，最後僅餘一籃，乃以易吡霜服之，後救活給以微資四元五角，一月後竟糊口而有餘，此卽爲一個人生命之代價也。又一女子復如是，所需醫藥費僅一元五角，而得暫時保全一家，其不令人驚異乎！　　以一個人的生命來「按市價」，稱斤兩，未免不倫，然而人命估價至如此之低，實在令人有「狗彘不若」之感。當然，我們之所以悲痛，問題還不在誰的生命值幾元幾角，誰又值十萬百萬的差異，而是現社會之下這種「楊梅瘡冲頂」的潰爛情形。這卽是說許多人一車一馬一遊一宴之奉，在此懸殊的狀態中，便是千百萬人「生命的代價」，這種慘酷的對照，實在表現了人們間享樂的生，與悲痛的死！村莊六月祭  西蒙　　老天爺彷彿成心跟這些人家子作梗，用不着雨的日子徧是戳穿肚洞似的降個無休無止，不消一天半天的工夫，所有的田園便一望汪洋洋都是水，水，滿溢到爬過阡陌浪費地流入河澗里，池塘里去，這是栽秧時節啊！過些時再這樣不就好了？　　人們都有點感到雨落的不對時分的惋惜着。　　雨儘是下着，秧積幾乎沒從播起，只有覷乾晴空兒栽播，秧種挿過後，正是需要多量的雨水的時節了。可是老天倒慳吝起來，怎麼也不掉落點滴的雨珠來，老是那麽棚着古銅色的臉孔，有如凝結一樣，雨似乎已經在早些時瀉乾凈了，而同時太陽可一天天的有執勁，打淸早起便張着炎炎的火傘，燒燃着大地，燒燃着整個村子，燒燃着村子的每個人的心，於是樹木擺着憂鬱的沒生氣的顏色，人在遇燙的薰風里，用着焦灼的心情喘息地打發日子，太陽越强烈天越澄明，河澗里，池塘里的一份水便越淺涸得快，一分一寸被蒸發上去，人也從希望的日子轉跌到漸漸失望的日子。　　旱的預感像一個恐怖的鬼影跫進人們的心底。　　於是水車凄切的咿呀的節奏聲緊密地布滿了田區間，天一亮，誰都忽忙地挑着水車子趕集到自家的田上，好像怕一落後就會給別人搶光了去。在烈日之下，他們赤着膊胳，流着粗汗子，老子和兒子一起站在水車另一端的木架子上，不停地用脚掌踏動圓輪子，把河里池里的水引灌到田上，可是田地早呌毒太</p>
<p>Page 20</p>
<p>陽煉得鐵那麽硬朗，　裂出無數的闊縫嘴兒，用了不少的汗和氣力車上來的一點兒水，馬上給那些闊縫嘴兒吞吸下去只見乾操的地面濕了些，而對於那一田萎着枯黃的身子的秧苗，絲毫也沒得到好處。　　—媽他娘子，車起來的水呌王人士嘴兒佔了去還來不及的。　　瞧着一行辛苦地車進田里的水，又悄悄儘輸入那些闊嘴土兒去，沒個不無端的罵着，另後歇一歇腿子，太息一陣。　　—老天眞是忍心旱死人麽，雨呀雨，什麽時候降一陣呢？　　大家子都是這樣熱切的期望着。尤其是田區恰好座落在低地的人，因爲車水的時侯已十分費動，而車起的水，流過泥堆築成的一條長長的溝子時便總是有一半流向別人的高地田里去，賸下來的才是流到自己的田里，可是滋潤乾癟的土地還嫌不够的。　　但是這周圍幾十區田地中間，却只有兩三口池塘，每天十幾架水車子儘車着，太陽又儘那麼蒸發着，緩緩地車身露出水面愈見愈高，池里的水也就愈來愈竭涸，漸漸地終於顯出河荼來了，水沒有了，池塘里只留下污臭濃濁的爛泥堆，沒三兩天，連爛泥堆也呌太陽煉得硬巴巴了。　　田間的秧子一叢叢從靑色到黃色，從黃色到枯乾，又一叢叢倒下去，人的意志也跟着倒下去。假如有一派大雨，是的，在這時候淋一派大雨，倒下來的秧子也還可以立刻甦活過來的。然而始終不見雨的影子，望望天吧！永遠是平邊的古銅顏色，太陽熱騰騰載在腦袋上。　　人反而閒了下來，有氣力沒地方使用，然而便這樣等，待死的降臨不成，不得想法補救。　　大家想起隔村屬於李家宅所有的一條河澗，這河澗的水量自然比較充足。因此在陳家宅的人們把水車擱到蓬棚去的時候，他們尙可聽到那面水車的咿呀聲。他們打算合李家宅的人商量，從坷澗里引水灌救自己的田，築一個大溝閘，於是有人過去請幫忙了。　　於是人群排集到村前廣塲上等消息。　　然而當這水等於金子一樣貴重的時候，那面的人目前雖是還沒至於水荒的情形。但亦正同樣担心着終有一天河乾水凈的，怎肯分讓給別人。　　——她媽的，每個人都搖頭，說他們也快沒水可車了。　　回來的人氣憤憤地向大家報告。　　—怎麽辦呢，怎麽辦呢？和那些雜嘴子的小伙子當然說不來，呌村長去跟他們的村長討情吧。　　是娘兒們急迫的聲音。　　—搭他李家宅全村的十三代祖宗，這有什麽理由，河溪都是人人有份的，河水誰要不得，別再去說，木中用，一說他們倒反以爲那條河果眞是他們自己的了。不管他，我們儘管排出車子來再講。　　靑年夥子發火了，賴着足。　　過幾天陳家宅的田區緊接着李家宅那條河的邊沿果然步現一個大閘了，在旁邊另外按起許多支流的小溝子，同時用好多架車子　　地車着水輸送到每一田區里。人們臉上免强掛着苦笑可是年老人却憂心着：年頭已經不好，若因此鬧出什麽亂子來，吃官司，不是玩兒啊！　　那面的人騷亂了，起先來了一通警告，說如不自已把水閘拆毀，他們就要强行拆毀，一面告官去。　　這面的人當然不去理睬。　　第二天水閘眞的給毀平了，小溝子也給塞住，他們都知道呈李家宅幹的。再第二天水閘小溝子又狠快地造成，造成了的隔天又給毀掉，這樣造上來毀掉，毀掉了又造上來，不知幾多次了。　　於是漸由幾個人的消極的暗鬥變成正面的仇視和衝突了。這衝突就是當陳家宅的一行人担着水車走近李家宅的地帶的時候，忽然從那面遠遠地有一陣人帶着傢伙衝來，背後饗着大鑼大鼓，這一行人們慌了，趕忙掉棄了水車，跑回來自己的村子；李家宅的人打過來了，打過來了，大家快把傢伙出來擋喲！那麽一路呌嚷。　　後面區着的人已越過陳家宅的地段了。　　於是陳家宅前村的原野一下子成爲殺氣密佈的戰場。　　於是鼓子銅鑼發狂地推打的聲音，孩子的哭啼，婦人的呌喊，作戰者粗暴的叱咤，畜牲驚慌的飛動，傢伙跟傢伙的碰撞的，一等種騷雜的聲間佔領了整個的空間，緊張地賢住着每個人顫慄的心。　　結果兩邊都犧牲了幾個壯丁，似乎不分勝負而散。原野上瀰漫着陰慘的氣息。　　下午縣府派了大批武裝人馬，下鄉把兩村的村長交了去，另外捉了一些人　　太陽依舊火辣文地高撑着。　　一片無邊的寂靜暫時籠罩了兩村。粮　問題投宿  新野　　當航船緩緩地行進大驛口時，太陽已經躱到繭山背後去了。一切自然界的輪廓全漸漸地蒙上了一層夜的黑紗，這黑紗越披越厚，愈裏愈緊；終於，它的姿態模糊得僅成了一些憧憧的黑影。　　「城裏船捉得很利害，我看你們進去是很危險的」！大驛口有人在報信。我們聽得了這個意外消息，誰都戚到萬分不安，一顆心重重地向下沉了下去。　　「那末我們是不是準備開進去呢？要是不開進去，這裏離城還有三十多里路，呌這許多人怎麽辦」？我這樣向船家問。　　「這個危險是不能胃的」，船家囁　着把船停了下來，靠在大驛過一夜，明天再開回去了。　　船是不開了，許多人都上岸去找住宿；然而我因為明天一早還有事情，不能遲到城裏的，所以我和母親商議好，决計摸着夜路趕一程。　　兩個人上了岸，便向着桑田里泥路上走去，好在天氣已經晴了幾天，因此那些狹窄的泥路倒還乾燥。大澤離開城裏至少還有二十多里路，今夜要想趕到是萬萬不能夠的，然而在這一段路程中又沒有個村落，和一家人家，甚至連找一個枯廟或凉亭來歇息一下都沒有。　　走得乏了，便在路邊矮石上坐一回再走。　　「肚子裏一天快沒有吃過東西，現在我實在走不動了」！　　「走吧！再過三里路，就有一雙尼菴，那裏的老尼姑是和我認識的，我們就到那裏去借宿一宵再說吧」！母親這樣安慰着我，其實她自己也在搬腿不動了。　　肚子又饑，嘴裏又渴，但是我們還是拖着了個沉重的步子向前走去。雖然是初夏的季候，可是因爲我們跑了急路，所以我們體內的每一個細胞似乎都在燃燒，汗也不住地從額上掛下來。　　一彎新月已靜靜地移到了天幔上，無數星子却在對着我們睞眼；眼前是那麽幽美的夜景，但週遭却又這樣靜寂，幾乎連了自家兒的呼吸，和輕細的脚步聲都可聽得十分淸晰。　　漸漸地犬吠聲巳經可以聽得，然而這聲音是那樣微弱的，飄遠的，要不是在靜夜，决不會使人聽到。　　「那座尼菴已經到快了，快走吧」！母親像哄騙孩子似的對我說。　　「還有多少路呢」？我還是焦迫地問。　　「快啦！就在前面——」　　繼續地順着一條石子小徑前進，抹了一個彎，從一條不十分高的橋上爬過去，在田隴間有一堵白堊的牆壁矗立着。我們走上田埂，就可在月光下看得分明，上那便是一所尼菴。　　母親站在那破舊的大門前去叩阿，我就在照照牆下那塊大石上坐了下來喘息。　　母親一連叩了幾下，可是裏面沒有答應，她於是用一副失望的眼睛對我望子一下；接着她又盡力地喊：「三師太…三師…太…」　　「咦！難道一個也不在菴里嗎？不見得會全走光的吧」！母親自已咕膿着。　　停了許久，窗眼裏透出一褸幽幽的燈光來了。「有人的」！母親安慰着說。　　「咳…咳…咳……咳咳……」一陣連續的咳嗽聲送到了門邊，隱隱還聽得有人在着！　　㗒！半夜三更有誰來搗門呵」！裏邊有了問聲，母親却連忙接上去說：「我呀！三師太，深更半夜要你老起來開門，罪過！罪過」！　　門巳呀然地開了，我偷眼對那老尼姑打量一眼，見她却是一位五十多歲，沒有剪去髮髻的老太婆；她却也眯着一對老花了的眼睛，對母親望了一下：　　「噢！原來是山上阿姊，我道半夜三更有誰來敲門；你從山上來嗎？爲什麽這樣的晚喲」！她親熱地招呼：「晚飯不見得吃過吧，這裏冷飯還有，我看燒些泡粥吃了吧」！她一壁揭着飯籃，一壁望望站在傍邊呆若木鷄的我：「這就是你的大少爺麽？啊！認不得了，纔幾年不見他，已長得這末大啦！哦！你眞好福氣」！　　「是的，三師太你看這樣大的人，連人都不會呌一聲的」。母親蹲在灶下燒火，，一面和她談話：「還有兩位小師太呢」？　　「唉！她們嗎？天不保佑，可憐都在去年出天花死了」她說着用袖子抹了兩把老淚，樣子是怪悲傷的，母親也陪着她眼紅了一回。　　泡飯擺在一隻破舊的白木桌上，我捧了粥碗對桌上望望，只見半碗臭鹹菜和半碗霉豆；雖然肚子餓極了，但也勉强喝了一碗白粥。　　這一夜我和母親就在一隻堆滿稻草的板床上宿了一夜，我雖覺疲憊，然而終不能酣然入睡，儘翻來覆去的在稻草上面打骨碌，一顆心是像給懸在空中一樣的不舒服！雨之什（續）  眞　　「爸爸，收了穀，買個活鯽魚來吃，好嗎？」　　「是啊，乖乖，你說有雨落嗎？」他像問測字先生，兒童的話是常靈騐的，照俗例。　　「有的，有的，立刻有大雨。」大雨大魚，小孩的詞典上是連在一道的，在陰黑處他也閃出了一個笑臉。　　又是一聲大雷，接着便下大雨，像冰雹那麼大一粒的，草屋上是基哇基哇的迴聲。　　因爲一月餘驕陽把草屋上的草晒得收縮了，雨便從草隙裏鑽進來落在屋子裏，床上，灶上，碗櫥上，一片咚咚啵啵的歌唱聲，但南海叔一家仍是笑瞇　地，他們把被子抱開，每個就板凳，椅子睡起來；睡不着，硬挺挺地，可不要緊犧牲夜把磕睡，將來有飽飯吃，還租，還債，那數目全在南海叔心裏淸算了一下；老婆子是一件新衣；兒子是白米飯，活鯽魚。　　雨，漸小漸細而終于停止了。南海叔又感着一種恐怖，—那便是「不足」，再落一飱的工夫便好了。　　第二天草屋裏剛竄來一綫光亮，便吩咐老婆子凈手上香謝，菩薩，南海叔自己便掮上鋤頭去鋤田，剛走到田塍口，便瞧見師子嶺上的端五爹在做田滕口。　　「五爹，早啦！恭喜你得了時雨，有飽飯吃！」　　「大家都是一樣，恭喜你，只可惜太小了點。怪啦，法老板的田裏又足了，他眞是行時！」　　「六月有雨隔田塍，俗話說得不錯的。」　　田壩上有一小潭水，那是傍着端五爹和南海叔的田邊的。南海叔瞧見自己田裏水不上兩三寸，便鋤一條溝把那潭水引到田裏來，這可使端五爹眼紅了：「這水應當歸我呀！」　　爭着，兩個老頭兒打起來，南海叔脚一滑，跌倒泥潭裏。他帶起滿身泥水回家，老婆正在上香拜菩薩，等到他告訴她這消息後，她只報了一個美。（完）播音節目歌唱</p>

<h3 id="e1">Further Negotiations on Chahar Issue; Essentially No Problems in the Overall Situation; Doihara Temporarily Remains in Beiping Awaiting Conclusion; Xiao Zhenying Visits Song to Report on Progress; Second Central Government Response Arrives in Beiping <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to Qin Dechun speaking to reporters, the Central Government's reply regarding the Chahar issue arrived in Beiping on the evening of the 26th, and a complete resolution is expected on the 27th. (Central News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the Central Government's reply regarding the Zhangbei Incident negotiations arrived in Beiping the day before yesterday, our responsible officials immediately convened yesterday afternoon to discuss implementation measures. After the meeting, the determined measures were telegraphed to the Central Government for instructions. The Central Government promptly sent a reply to Beiping last night. Consequently, Qin Dechun and Xiao Zhenying went to the Japanese Consulate at 3:00 AM this morning to visit Doihara, the representative of the Japanese Kwantung Army, again to negotiate everything. Due to some remaining minor issues, a unanimous agreement could not be reached, so a complete resolution was not achieved at that time. After Qin and Xiao departed, Qin sent Zhang Yunrong and Chen Juesheng for a third consultation with Doihara at 9:00 AM this morning. As a result, a resolution has largely been completely achieved. Unless other issues arise, there will be no further talks. Currently, our responsible officials have telegraphed a report on the negotiation process to the Central Government. Concrete results are expected to be realized within days. (Special dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Doihara originally planned to leave Beiping for Tianjin this morning on official business. Now that negotiations are showing promise, and the future of the incident is expected to reach a conclusion, with only minor matters and formalities remaining to be completed, he plans to stay in Beiping for another day or two until the matter is concluded before leaving Beiping. (Special dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Doihara visited Takahashi, the Japanese military attaché, at the Japanese Embassy at around 10:00 AM this morning. It is reported that key Japanese figures have decided to hold a meeting at the Japanese military attaché's office at around 6:00 PM this evening to discuss specific implementation measures regarding the Zhangbei Incident negotiations. (Special dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) With the handling of the Chahar issue nearing completion, Xiao Zhenying is going to Tianjin this afternoon to visit Song for a discussion. (Special dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 7:00 PM on the 26th, Xiao Zhenying arrived in Tianjin from Beiping and immediately went to Song Zheyuan's residence in the British Concession to request an audience and report on the day's negotiations in Beiping regarding the Zhangbei Incident. He is scheduled to return to Beiping early on the 27th. (Special dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Xiao Zhenying arrived in Tianjin from Beiping at 7:05 PM on the afternoon of the 26th to visit Song Zheyuan. (Central News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Negotiations on the Chahar issue have been quite laborious. Qin Dechun, Xiao Zhenying, and others studied the matter thoroughly overnight on the 25th, encountering some twists and turns. On the morning of the 26th, Qin visited Doihara for a meeting, finally gaining understanding.

Conservative Party Member of Parliament, Sir Ketton-Cremer, asked what measures the government would take to protect British commercial interests in North China, and what steps would be planned to protect treaty rights and the Open Door policy. Foreign Secretary Hoare replied that he had not heard of British interests being harmed by recent events and that the current situation did not seem to require special action by the British government. Britain's policy in the Far East is, of course, aimed at protecting British interests, he said. Hoare also replied to Conservative MP Bernays's question, saying that the principle of the Open Door in North China had not been jeopardized, so there was no question of asking the Japanese government to maintain this principle. He had not heard that the Kailuan Mining Administration had been disturbed by the actions of Japanese troops in North China. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Zhang Houwan returned to Beiping from Tianjin at 6:40 AM today. According to his discussion, Shang needs to wait until Cheng Ke completes the handover of duties as mayor of Tianjin before setting a date to assume his new post. Cheng is expected to take office within days, but the exact date is not yet determined. Zhang will return to Baoding tonight or tomorrow morning to prepare for the transfer of the provincial government. (Central News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Shang Zhen said that he expects the Central Government's order to arrive today. Because he must wait for the new Mayor Cheng to take office before he can leave Tianjin for Baoding, and Cheng intends to take over without haste, it is difficult to determine the date of departure from Tianjin. However, he must go to Baoding within two days at the latest. He will not stop in Beiping to avoid delays. Zhang Houwan came today to negotiate, saying that the provincial government's routine meetings have not been held for many days, and there is a large backlog of pending matters, urging Shang to go to take over. Because he has not been involved in Hebei Province's politics for many years, he is unfamiliar with the situation. In the current situation, which is different from the past, the key points of his administration will be to: 1. Ensure the safety of society and people's hearts; 2. Relieve the people's livelihood and suffering; 3. Promote friendly relations. Hebei Province has been politically unstable and rural areas have been bankrupt for years. These are the urgent tasks for governance. He is not opposed to joint offices because they are economical and convenient, but he finds it difficult to implement due to the lack of housing in Baoding. He has not suggested to the Central Government to move the provincial government to Beiping. After he takes office, some of the provincial government may be reorganized. The Tianjin-Guzhen Security Commander is concurrently held by the Chairman of the Province, as usual. In order to make the name and reality match, it may also be partially changed. (Special dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Shang Zhen visited Cheng Ke on the afternoon of the 26th to urge him to take office as mayor of Tianjin as soon as possible. Cheng replied that preparations were not yet complete and that he planned to take over on the 28th. (Special dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhang Houwan said that he intends to visit Wang Kemin, the acting chairman of the Zhengzheng Committee, in Beiping to request instructions, and then return to Baoding immediately to prepare for the handover of all provincial departments and provincial committees. Although he intends to resign now, he is determined to continue to be responsible until he is approved, so as to avoid interruption of government affairs. Although the total provincial budget for the 24th year has been completed, it has been shaken again due to the suspension of the allocation of 80,000 yuan per month from Tianjin. It should be revised after the new chairman takes office. (Special dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Tianjin-Guzhen Security Headquarters has added three sections: Military Medicine, Military Equipment, and Telecommunications, under the Staff Department, and a separate Adjutant's Office under the General Affairs Department.

<p>(Tianjin) Zhang Houwan visited Shang Zhen at the Tianjin Municipal Government at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 26th to urge him to go to Baoding as soon as possible to take over as Provincial Chairman. Because the provincial government has been in a state of flux since moving to Baoding due to political changes, everything is waiting for him to preside over.

<p>(Beiping) Matsumoto Tadao, a Japanese commissioner for investigation in China, arrived in Beiping on the evening of the 25th.

In the afternoon, he toured the Forbidden City and is scheduled to tour the Summer Palace on the morning of the 28th, go to Chahar at noon, stay for one day, and return to Beiping on the 29th before going to Tianjin to transfer to Jinan and then return home. According to Matsumoto, this visit to China has no special mission. Because he has always been interested in China, he came to investigate. When he visited President Wang in Beijing, he only made ordinary courtesies and did not mention diplomatic issues. The anti-Japanese sentiment in various parts of China has gradually subsided recently, but he still hopes that the people of the two countries will further cooperate and be friendly.

<p>Ma Yinchu Discusses the Contents of the Implementation Regulations: Avoiding Complexity Is Probably the Reason for Not Promulgating</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At today's Central Political Council meeting, the Implementation Regulations for the National General Budget of the Republic of China for the 24th year, passed by the Legislative Yuan at its 22nd meeting of the fourth session, were submitted for discussion. According to a Central News Agency reporter, the members all believed that the execution of the national revenue and expenditure general budget for this year, in addition to the execution notes approved by the Central Political Council, also has detailed regulations in other laws and regulations, and there is no need to formulate implementation regulations again, so it was decided that the above regulations need not be promulgated. (Central News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Yinchu is scheduled to leave Nanjing for Qingdao on the 27th to lecture. Regarding the Central Political Council's decision at the meeting on the 26th that the Implementation Regulations for the National General Budget of the 24th year need not be promulgated, someone inquired with Ma. Ma did not want to comment on the matter because the case had been decided by the Central Government. However, according to inquiries, the principles of the Public Debt Law previously passed by the Central Political Council have detailed regulations on the issuance procedures for treasury bills and public bonds, and the actual situation of the various public bonds that have been issued has also been stipulated in the principles, requiring a report to the Supervisory Yuan once a year and public announcement. The various regulations in the Implementation Regulations of the General Budget are mostly original in the principles of the Public Debt Law. The Central Political Council decided that the regulations need not be promulgated, probably to avoid complexity. (Central News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>

<p>(Washington) It is learned that officials are keeping silent about the rumors that Japan may conclude a military alliance with European countries, but it is indeed a fact that the government is paying special attention to this matter. The State Department and the War Department believe that if Germany and Japan conclude an alliance, it will be the most important development in the recent international situation. According to observers here, if a German-Japanese alliance can be realized, it may completely change the naval and land forces of countries in the East and West. Judging from the current German-Japanese relations, the military elements in the two countries have an obvious tendency to naturally approach each other. Because the Japanese army initially imitated Germany, and over the years, most of the Japanese officers who went abroad to study went to Germany, officials here are not surprised by the Tokyo news that Germany will soon have a goodwill mission to visit Japan. Even the conclusion of a mutual assistance treaty between the two countries is expected. (National Telegraph, 25th)</p>

<h3 id="e18">Factors in the Development of Japanese Industry and Commerce <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Since the Meiji Restoration, the people of Japan have begun to strive for self-improvement, imitating Europe and the United States and striving to promote industry and commerce. Therefore, the development of Japanese industry and commerce has only been about 40 years. Now, Japanese industry and commerce have dominated the world. Not only has the textile industry seized the leading position of the United Kingdom, but also the development of heavy industry in the past 15 years has shocked the international community. According to a survey by the Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the production value of the national metal industry and machinery and equipment industry in 1934 increased by more than 50% compared with the previous year. The speed of its development is only second to the socialist Soviet Union. Moreover, since 1929, economic panic has spread throughout the world, and industrial countries have felt the pain of overproduction, while Japan has used the weapon of currency inflation to dump cheap products on the international market, and exports have increased year by year. This situation poses a deep and significant threat to the economies of various countries in the world. The International Chamber of Commerce Joint Conference in Paris paid attention to the issue of Japanese goods competition and put it forward for discussion.</p>
<p>Sir Balfour, a leader in the British business community, said in a speech at the Daewoo that the competition of Japanese goods in the world is beneficial and harmless. He is not ignoring the threat of Japanese goods dumping, but wants to encourage the old industrial countries to imitate Japan's spirit of perseverance. According to Sir Balfour's observations, there are two reasons for the development of Japanese industry and commerce: 1. Japan adopts the production methods of the world's major countries and conducts in-depth research. 2. Japan's labor force is cheaper than other countries due to the low standard of living of the people. The above two reasons are indeed very accurate, but we believe that there is another important reason why Japanese industry and commerce have been able to flourish to such a degree in such a short period of decades, that is, the government's encouragement and protection of industry and commerce, and the full cooperation of financial capitalists with industry and commerce.</p>
<p>The Japanese government's care for its own industry and commerce can be said to be meticulous. Japanese goods, which are in a disadvantageous position in the international market, are often able to be dumped because of national subsidies. Japanese financial capitalists are particularly integrated with industry and commerce. The number of investments by major financial groups in industry is astonishing. In recent years, world economic competition has become increasingly fierce, and countries have built high tariff barriers. No matter how hard Japanese industry and commerce try, if they do not get political and financial assistance, how can they resist the dangerous international waves?</p>
<p>When we examine the situation of our country's industry and commerce, we feel the importance of these factors even more. Our country's labor costs are no less than Japan's, and in recent years, especially in the industrial field, talents have emerged in large numbers. In some sectors, the production technology is enough to cause jealousy among the Japanese. For example, the alkali industry in Tianjin is one that the Japanese have repeatedly tried and failed. Under the management of Chinese people, it has achieved remarkable results. In addition, whether it is the textile industry or the electrical appliance industry, the quality of their products often surpasses Japanese goods. In the past few years, China has been in distress and the local areas have been unstable, but various emerging industries are still emerging like a storm, and the achievements are remarkable, which shows that the perseverance of Chinese people in operating industries is no less than that of the Japanese. From this, we can view the prospects of our country's industry and commerce optimistically. It is only that under the high pressure of international imperialism, the government's conservation policy is sometimes restricted, and the financial community cannot fully cooperate with industry and commerce, so industry and commerce have to fall into a state of stagnation.</p>
<p>Recently, our country's government and financial community have gradually realized the need to protect industry and commerce. Recently, the national government announced the revision of the customs export tax rate, and the financial community is scheduled to implement industrial and commercial loans, which is a manifestation of this kind of intention. At a time when industry and commerce are extremely declining, these partial relief measures are not免 to be a drop in the bucket. However, if this spirit of cherishing industry and commerce can be promoted, it may not be the driving force for the revival of our country's industry and commerce.</p>

<p>(Rome) It is reported that before Eden's departure for Paris today, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini explained to him Italy's objectives regarding the Abyssinian issue as follows: (1) Italy's right to peaceful possession of its colonies; (2) Italy's right to build roads, railways, and bridges, and to establish schools in Abyssinia; (3) Italy's right to use its good influence to civilize the country. According to well-informed Italian sources, Italy is not prepared to support demands for colonial expansion. It is reported that Eden presented several suggestions based on instructions from his government, but after hearing the Italian Prime Minister's words, he felt that Italy was reluctant to accept any partial solution. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>(Rome) It is generally believed that British-Italian talks aimed at resolving the Abyssinian issue have failed. British Minister Without Portfolio Eden presented British mediation proposals, which Italian Prime Minister Mussolini explicitly rejected. Eden suggested that Italy be allowed to build a railway through Abyssinian territory to connect Italian Somaliland and Eritrea. In return, Abyssinia would be granted access to Red Sea ports through British Somaliland. Mussolini reportedly rejected this proposal, stating that Italy views the Abyssinian issue as a whole and believes that only a thorough change in the Abyssinian political system is the only solution. He added that the League of Nations should have the authority to implement this change. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(Rome) British Minister Without Portfolio Eden discussed the Abyssinian issue with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini yesterday and this evening. Their meeting this afternoon lasted an hour, during which they reportedly expressed their opinions on the Abyssinian issue sincerely. British and Italian circles believe that even if the talks between the two politicians produced nothing else, this exchange was worthwhile for Eden's trip. People here now believe that Eden will return home with a clear understanding of Italy's emphasis on the Italo-Abyssinian dispute and its desire for a thorough solution. According to a communiqué, Mussolini and Eden's talks also involved a study of various European problems. They resolved that for the sake of European security, they should develop the principles outlined in the Anglo-French declaration issued in London on February 3rd and established at the Stresa Conference. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>(Rome) After his two talks with Prime Minister Mussolini, Sir Anthony Eden told reporters, "My trip to Rome has been very valuable, and I am particularly pleased with the results achieved in the naval negotiations. The air force convention was also discussed. The British and Italian governments are in complete agreement on continuing to adhere to the principles decided at the Stresa Conference. Regarding the Abyssinian issue, Mussolini and I exchanged views frankly."

<p>(Rome) It is reported that during the British-Italian talks, Prime Minister Mussolini told British Minister Without Portfolio Eden that Italy always maintains the concept of indivisible joint solutions regarding various international issues. As for the Anglo-German naval agreement, Italy considers it a fait accompli but will still express reservations regarding the procedures adopted by Britain. Furthermore, Eden and Mussolini discussed each item contained in the Anglo-French London Declaration of February 3rd, except for the section on Germany's return to the League of Nations. Regarding the Eastern European Pact, Mussolini expressed his general approval but reserved judgment on the consequences that this pact might have on general policy. In addition, Mussolini stated that the Danube Pact is extremely important, and he will continue to prepare for the Rome Nine-Power Conference. Regarding the Abyssinian issue, official statements indicate that Eden did not bring any suggestions with him. However, it is reported that Eden stated that British intervention, with appropriate benefits for Italy to avoid military action, would be beneficial. Mussolini replied that the Abyssinian issue should not be resolved solely based on recent events but requires a resolution of the entire problem. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Italian Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Suvich made the following statement to the Associated Press today after Eden and Mussolini's talks: "We are convinced that Italy's mission in Abyssinia is to abolish slavery and establish orderly civil governments in the Galla, Sidamo, and Somali regions to replace military oppression. We will also give Abyssinia itself the opportunity to participate in this plan, and Italy intends to fully protect British interests in Abyssinia. Therefore, Italy's actions should be welcomed by the world." As for the results of Eden and Mussolini's talks, the official communiqué is quite vague. Now, Suvich has openly expressed Italy's views. According to sources here, Eden has made considerable concessions on the Abyssinian issue in the hope that Italy will abandon its reservation plans regarding the Anglo-German naval agreement. However, reliable sources still say that Italy has not made a formal decision, and preparations for war against Abyssinia are continuing. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>

<p>(London) Labour MP Mr. Cocks asked the government in the House of Commons whether the Anglo-German naval agreement would replace Part V of the Treaty of Versailles concerning naval armaments. Foreign Secretary Hoare replied, "Although the Anglo-German naval agreement has been in effect since the date of signing, it will be included in a general agreement on armaments in the future. The aim of British policy has always been to conclude a general agreement to replace Part V of the Treaty of Versailles." Mr. Cocks also asked whether the Foreign Secretary was aware that Germany's obligations under the Treaty of Versailles could not be unilaterally abolished by one country. Mr. Hoare replied that the government had previously issued official statements responding to various objections raised on this point and could not repeat them. Mr. Cocks then raised other questions about the Anglo-German naval agreement, questioning the Foreign Secretary as to whether the provisions prohibiting naval military supplies from escaping from Germany were effectively eliminated after the signing of the Anglo-German naval agreement. Mr. Hoare replied, "We will continue to uphold the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles regarding arms exports to Germany and will not change them as a result of the recent exchange of notes between Britain and Germany on naval issues."

<p>(Paris) The Permanent Bureau of the French Naval Committee stated today that the Anglo-German naval agreement has completely invalidated the naval provisions of the Treaty of Versailles. Therefore, until a new concrete treaty is concluded, Germany has regained all freedom regarding the navy. Naval representatives also urged the government to find ways to ensure France's security in the Mediterranean and Atlantic, but they also did not agree to decide on a new shipbuilding plan before knowing the actual situation of the Anglo-German treaty. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Naval Committee of the Chamber of Deputies passed a motion today stating that the establishment of the Anglo-German naval agreement has forced France to restore complete freedom of action. Unless a new naval agreement of a general nature can be concluded, France will not change this attitude. The government must take various necessary measures to ensure France's maritime security. Naval Minister Pietri attended the committee and submitted a detailed report on the Anglo-German naval agreement, stating that Germany can now build new warships with the latest equipment, but France's naval tonnage, including warships currently under construction, still maintains 50% of the British naval tonnage. The existing naval fleet also includes several of the latest warships, so there is no need to worry. Moreover, because of the close friendship between France and Italy, France can draw several ships from the Mediterranean fleet to strengthen the fleet in the North Sea and the English Channel. The French Bretagne-class battleships have been completely renovated, so even if the Dunkerque and Strasbourg armored cruisers are not completed, the French navy is still well-prepared.

<p>(Paris) Germany previously sent a memorandum to the signatories of the Locarno Pact, raising objections to the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty, claiming that it was in conflict with the provisions of the Locarno Pact. The French government has now drafted a reply, which Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval gave to German Chargé d'Affaires Forster to be forwarded to Berlin. The reply demonstrates that the Mutual Assistance Treaty does not conflict with the Locarno Pact. Before responding to Germany, the government sought the opinions of Britain and Italy, and the three countries' opinions were consistent. (Havas, 25th)</p>

<p>(Paris) Prime Minister Laval officially stated last night at a banquet for the French press that the resolution of the Saar issue has eliminated the factors of Franco-German conflict. The government has sometimes been criticized for concluding a mutual aid pact with Soviet Russia, but we are neither pro-Russian nor pro-British or pro-Italian, nor do we hate any country. As a Frenchman who loves peace, I sincerely express sympathy to any country that is willing to cooperate with France to maintain peace. Laval further stated that he has no inclination to avoid concluding any agreement with any country and has never made statements that cause foreign misunderstanding. If it is possible to conclude a treaty with Germany, he would do so without hesitation. Laval indicated that such an agreement could only be concluded if both sides were willing, not unilaterally. Laval finally spoke about domestic politics, saying that he still believes in the democratic system and that it is not inferior to other political systems. The government will not abuse the full powers granted by Parliament. (National Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Prime Minister Laval recently delivered a speech to the Association of Provincial Newspapers, emphasizing the necessity of balancing the budget, saying that this should not only start with austerity measures but also develop economic undertakings to increase national income. We must take bold measures to overcome the difficulties, regardless of all obstacles. If we cannot fulfill this responsibility, not only will the French political system be shaken, but also the fate of France will be in danger. Regarding foreign policy, he said, "We are neither pro-Italian, nor pro-British, nor pro-Russian. All French people and all pacifists are willing to cooperate with governments of all countries to achieve a successful peace organization. If we have the possibility of establishing an agreement with Germany, we will not hesitate to do so, but this agreement should be concluded by several countries at the same time, and not just by two countries."

<p>(Tokyo) Yesterday's Cabinet meeting approved the Minister of Finance's policy on the compilation of the 1936 budget proposal. The Minister of War declared that he could not reduce the military expenditure because Soviet Russia is currently amassing a large army along the border. The military burden can only be reduced after the Soviet troops withdraw. Therefore, the Minister of Finance asked the Minister of War to pay attention to the nation's finances from a broader perspective and weigh the relative importance of military affairs when compiling the budget proposal. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The new guidelines for compiling the next year's budget were officially decided on the 25th and will be communicated by the Minister of Finance to the authorities of each province. The total amount of next year's budget is roughly equivalent to this year's 2.24 billion yen. According to a survey by the Ministry of Finance, although the army's expenses have been reduced, the navy's expenses and various expenses related to public bonds have increased, and the base budget will reach 1.71 billion yen, an increase of 28 million yen compared to this year. However, only about 500 million yen can be approved for the new budget requests from each province. However, looking at the expenses that each province wants next year, the Ministry of War needs 150 million yen for the Manchurian Incident, 100 million yen for the second military reform, and 300 million yen for other new expenses. The Ministry of the Navy needs 300 million yen for land and water facilities, ship repair expenses, and other new expenses. As for the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, they plan to request at least 200 million yen to revitalize local agricultural villages. Whether Finance Minister Takahashi's financial policy can stop the expansion of the extraordinary budget is noteworthy. (Japan Associated Press, 26th)</p>

<p>(Moscow) The Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic celebrated its 15th anniversary today. A grand celebration was held in Kazan, the capital of the Republic, attended by more than 1,000 representatives from various Soviet republics. All newspapers carried articles about the Republic's great economic and cultural success. Before the revolution, the Tatars were deprived of all rights. They were illiterate, oppressed, and trapped under the tyranny of the Kazan province. The new Tatar Republic is prospering and has been awarded the Order of Lenin for its successful socialist construction. During the first and second five-year plans, 26 new large enterprises have been built, and existing factories have been expanded or rebuilt. Wooden plows in collective farms have been replaced by 3,333 tractors, in addition to 460 combined harvesters and thousands of other agricultural machines. Collective farms account for 90% of the country's sown area. During the Tsarist era, the Tatars only had 35 schools. Currently, 300,000 Tatars are enrolled in secondary schools. In the past 115 years, only six privileged Tatars graduated from Kazan University, but in the past 15 years, 2,350 Tatars have graduated from Kazan vocational schools. Currently, about 10,000 Tatars are studying in various vocational schools and technical colleges, including 350 Tatar professors and scientists who are engaged in various works. The revolution has produced several writers, artists, composers, sculptors, and actors. The Republic has received many congratulatory telegrams from all sides, one of which was sent by Kalinin, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union. (TASS, 25th)</p>

<p>(Paris) The 8th International Chamber of Commerce discussed the issue of currency stabilization today. Many speakers stated the necessity and possibility of international monetary stabilization. The British delegation was the first to maintain reservations, but Professor Gregory, an authority at the London School of Economics, stated that he strongly advocated currency stabilization but was not speaking on behalf of the British government or any organization. He was supported by French Professor Rist and German Professor Feiler. Professor Gregory declared that the devaluation of various modern currencies is by no means a sign of international recovery but will increase the general difficulties of foreign trade. The instability of the gold bloc countries has led to domestic competition for gold hoarding and foreign anxiety. In short, attempts to reduce currency values ​​to manage the world economic panic have created various factors that hinder world recovery. Sir Luke, speaking on behalf of the British government, stated that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has repeatedly announced that Britain's return to the gold standard is dependent on raising the price level to adjust selling prices and costs, removing obstacles to international trade, and adopting concrete measures to manage war debts and a system to prevent the purchasing power of gold from fluctuating due to currency policy. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) At today's meeting of the International Chamber of Commerce, the opinions of representatives from the British government and the business community of the gold standard countries differed greatly on the issue of immediately stabilizing currencies. Representatives from the gold standard countries demanded that Britain agree to convene a conference of governments to immediately discuss currency stabilization proposals. British representative Lord Luke stated Britain's monetary policy, saying that international equilibrium must be adjusted by the sale of goods and services, not by changes in gold and silver. This fundamental principle must be recognized, and discussions on currency stabilization must be discussed together with the removal of excessive commercial obstacles. The meeting of the International Chamber of Commerce has not yet reached the voting stage. (Reuters, 25th)</p>

Kong told the visitor that the reduction or exemption of export taxes has been announced, but the implementation period will be difficult to achieve by July 1 because a method for offsetting the losses has not been devised. At a time when the country's finances are in difficulty, once the tax is abolished, income will inevitably be greatly affected before a way to offset the losses is determined. The government is paying attention to both assisting industry and commerce and maintaining a balance of revenue and expenditure. Once the method of offsetting the losses is devised, it will be implemented. The starting date for the income tax has not yet been determined. The tax rules and tax rates still need to go through various procedures. As soon as the procedures are completed, the starting date can be set. It is likely that it can be implemented in the next fiscal year. As for the tax conference held in Shanghai, the unified tax rate is being discussed. According to Finance Ministry Secretary Li Tang, the Ministry of Industry has a detailed plan to assist yarn mills across the country. It plans to jointly submit the plan to the Central Government for approval and then provide assistance separately. The plan has not yet been sent over. Once it is sent, it will be submitted to the Central Government for review. It is not yet known whether the tax rates on cotton yarn and cigarettes will be changed. The Shanghai tax conference may discuss this. The request from Guangdong Province to issue local public bonds worth 5 million yuan is being reviewed by the responsible department. The outcome is unclear. (Special Dispatch, 26th)</p>

They each took the forms for their respective departments back for consideration and agreed to return them to the Bureau by July 3. If there were any additions or deletions, they would be revised and supplemented to make them more complete. The meeting adjourned at noon. (Central News Agency, 26th)</p>

<p>(Hangzhou) The Zhejiang Security Regiments Nos. 3, 4, and 7 were ordered to be transferred to western Hubei to suppress bandits in March of this year. Yu Jishi, Director of the Zhejiang Security Bureau and Commander of the Zhejiang Column, led the departure. It has been three months since then. Recently, Yu received an order from Chairman Chiang to merge the Zhejiang Security Regiments stationed in Hubei with the 58th Division and to appoint Yu as the commander of the division. After receiving the order, Yu considered that the Zhejiang Column Command Headquarters was originally established to facilitate the command of bandit suppression in the provincial capital. Now that the regiments stationed in Hubei have been ordered to be reorganized, and the regiments stationed in Zhejiang should also be transferred out of the province to suppress bandits, the Command Headquarters is no longer necessary. Yu has submitted a request to the Headquarters of the Generalissimo and the Zhejiang Security Command to dissolve the headquarters by the end of this month. It is also rumored that Jiang Zhiying, the deputy commander of the headquarters, will also receive a new appointment. Yu himself is currently stationed in Yichang and will take up his new post as commander of the 58th Division in the coming days. (Central News Agency, 26th)</p>

<p>Jingjiang Daily editor Liu Jianfan was arrested and sentenced to one year and eight months of imprisonment by Jingjiang County Magistrate Li Jinfang for publishing the novel "Injection," which was deemed to be harmful to public morals and obstructive to official duties. Liu Jianfan, dissatisfied with the original verdict, appealed to the Wuxian District Court. After repeated hearings, the Wuxian Court rendered its judgment at 5 PM on the 25th, overturning the original verdict. Liu Jianfan was sentenced to three months of imprisonment for harming public morals and defamation, and was ordered to pay Zou Ji one yuan in damages for reputational loss.</p>
<p>Resolution of Business Stoppage in Zhifan Village</p>
<p>Due to dissatisfaction with the Business Tax Bureau's intrusive inspection of relief books, businesses in the Zhifan Village area (specifically the wooden furniture industry) collectively ceased operations on the 25th and announced their liquidation, demonstrating firm resolve. Following persuasion by Cheng Ganqing, Chairman of the County Chamber of Commerce, businesses resumed operations by evening. Chairman Cheng then visited County Magistrate Wu on the 26th, along with Guo, Director of the Business Tax Bureau, to discuss mutually agreeable solutions. They requested that taxes continue to be levied based on capital assets to support business operations. Director Guo has agreed to consider this proposal.</p>
<p>Wuxi to Recruit Labor for Dredging Eight Major Waterways</p>
<p>The Construction Bureau of this county has determined that rivers within the county, bordering the lake and the river, rely on the lake and river for drainage. Last summer's drought left rivers dry in all directions, with the northeast region, being geographically higher, being particularly affected. The causes were attributed to insufficient rainfall, low lake and river water levels, and shallow and narrow rural waterways. Furthermore, riverside houses and bridges constricted the river surface, hindering water flow and preventing external water from irrigating the interior, leading to an unprecedented disaster. This year, in addition to dredging six major waterways, a construction plan has been formulated to recruit labor to selectively dredge eight major waterways in the sixth and seventh districts: Bushu Port, the sixth district's Heng River, Houyan River, Zhangjing Bridge Market River, Zha River, the fifth district's Sitou River, the seventh district's Xu Chong Bridge Port, and the fourth district's Luqu Bridge West River. Among these, Panjin Port and Heng River are the highest in elevation and have the shallowest and narrowest riverbeds, with a total length of 31.40 kilometers. The required funding has been estimated at 8,748 yuan.</p>
<p>Punishment for Damaging Baojia System</p>
<p>Recently, unscrupulous individuals in various rural areas of the county have been spreading rumors and deliberately fabricating stories, affixing red paper over the householder's name on the household registration plaque, claiming it can ward off evil spirits. This undermines the Baojia system. The county government has issued a public notice strictly prohibiting this. However, incidents have persisted in Anzhen, Zha Jia Bridge, Shi Dai Bridge, Houyang, Xu Xiang Su Xiang, and other areas. Local Bao chiefs are responsible for informing householders not to create unnecessary anxiety. Yesterday, the Second District Office also dispatched Meng Guangyou, head of the Dongting Town Guard Post, along with several local militiamen, to investigate the situation in Zhenbei Da Yan Lane, Xintang Bridge, and other areas. They found that the affixed red papers had been torn down in most places. However, in Zhouxiang Village in Xinteng Township, they were still present. The Fourth Bao Chief Zhou Xiangpei and Jia Chief Zhou Fuquan were instructed to bring the superstitious rumor-mongers Zhou Fujin and Qian Aquan, among others, to the District Office, where they were each fined six yuan in accordance with Article 39 of the Baojia regulations to serve as a warning.</p>
<p>Haimen County Government Searches for Remnants of Shen Bandit Gang</p>
<p>The sea bandit Shen Yushan (also known as Shen Fengshan) wreaked havoc on the sea and rivers of Haimen, Qidong, Tongzhou, Rugao, and Jiangyin for over a decade. He was apprehended in Lingju Port in this county last month on the 19th. The county government handed him over to the Nantong District Security Command for interrogation. He was sentenced to death and executed by firing squad on the 19th of this month. Fearing that remnants of the Shen bandit gang might be lurking in the port, the county government dispatched Deputy He Keqian of the Security Brigade and Dai Hongtao, Chief of the Public Security Bureau, on the afternoon of the 14th, leading over a dozen armed police officers, to work with the port's resident security team. They first deployed secret patrols on the streets, cutting off traffic, and then conducted a door-to-door search. However, the gang members had already fled. Only three Rong籍 women were apprehended. After interrogation by Deputy He, finding that they were not significantly involved, they were ordered to leave the area by a specified date and not to remain.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang: Ye Xiufeng Departs for Inspection</p>
<p>Ye Xiufeng, a standing committee member of the Provincial Anti-Smoking Association, departed on the morning of the 26th with several aides for Yangzhou to inspect the enforcement of smoking bans. On the 27th, he traveled from Yangzhou to Jingjiang and Taixing counties and will participate in the opening ceremony of the Nantong District Tobacco Farmers Factory on the 1st. The special commissioner's offices in various districts of Jiangbei plan to follow the Nantong District's model and petition the provincial government to establish tobacco farmer factories. However, the provincial authorities are awaiting the results of the pilot program in Nantong before gradually expanding it.</p>
<p>County Magistrate Inspects Baojia System in Rural Areas</p>
<p>The third phase of Baojia work in Zhenjiang County has been completed. To conduct random inspections, County Magistrate Ye Zhendong, along with Ren Weijun, a Baojia instructor from the Department of Civil Affairs, traveled to the southern and eastern rural areas on the morning of the 26th for random inspections.</p>
<p>Jingjiang: Various Industries Telegraph Support for Jingjiang Daily</p>
<p>Various trade associations in Jingjiang County, recognizing the historical significance of the Jingjiang Daily and its deep ties to various sectors, deeply regretted its suspension. They jointly telegraphed higher authorities, requesting its swift restoration. The telegram stated: "To the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, the Ministry of Interior, the Zhenjiang Provincial Party Headquarters, the Provincial Government, the Department of Civil Affairs, the Office of the Inspectorate, the Suzhou High Court, the Nantong Fourth District Party Affairs Guidance Office, and the Administrative Inspector Commissioner's Office: The Jingjiang Daily has been in publication for seven years, providing accurate and timely reports, enlightening the public, and improving customs, benefiting society. People from all walks of life praise it. However, its recent suspension due to the publication of the novel "Injection" angered the county magistrate, causing a public outcry. The public feels as if they have lost their voice. They hope the newspaper will be restored soon. Liu Zaiji, Chairman of the County Chamber of Commerce, Sheng Yu, Director of the County Education Association, and Wang Xulun, Director of the County Farmers Association, have previously conveyed public opinion and telegraphed requests for its restoration. We, the representatives of various local trade associations, witnessing this situation, cannot remain silent. We hereby jointly telegraph your departments, requesting you to consider public opinion and promptly order the newspaper's restoration to appease the people's yearning and uphold the Central Government's policy of supporting the press. We urgently await your instructions." Signed by: Liu Peilin, Chairman of the Jingjiang Timber Industry Association; Lu Shaochen, Chairman of the Sauce and Liquor Industry Association; Fang Yansong, Standing Committee Member of the Grain Industry Association; Fang Lanqi, Standing Committee Member of the Fish Industry Association; Ji Zhipeng, Chairman of the Domestic Sundries Industry Association; Zheng Xiangzhi, Chairman of the Cocoon Industry Association; Sheng Mingtong, Chairman of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Industry Association; Liu Minggan, Standing Committee Member of the Southern Goods Industry Association; Wang Yuechu, Standing Committee Member of the Yarn and Flower Industry Association, and others.</p>
<p>Nantong: Six-County Conference on Drug Suppression</p>
<p>Zheng Yitong, Administrative Inspector Commissioner of Nantong District, convened a conference on the 25th to address drug suppression. The conference was attended by the heads of the land and water police forces, directors of the Public Security Bureaus, and representatives of the Anti-Smoking Associations from the six counties of Nantong, Haimen, Rugao, Qidong, Chongming, and Jingjiang. Each county reported on its drug suppression efforts. Yang Wenyao of the Provincial Committee expressed the opinion that the source of drugs in the Nantong District differs slightly from other districts. While other districts primarily source drugs from Hankou, Nantong is close to Shanghai, with numerous harbors, and the entry of drugs, in addition to Hankou, is mostly from Shanghai, often smuggled via sand boats. This requires immediate attention. The conference discussed and proposed: (1) Establishing measures for land and water police teams to investigate and suppress drugs, to be submitted to the province for approval; (2) Addressing the shortage of investigation funds in various counties, requesting provincial subsidies; (3) Regulating the transportation routes of official soil for opium cultivation to prevent abuses.</p>
<p>Pinghu: Salt Smugglers Burn Privateer Captain Alive</p>
<p>Zhapu's Baojia Dui, Zhengjia Dui, Fangjia Dui, and Sujia Dui, collectively known as the "Four Dui," have a fierce local culture and are largely engaged in salt smuggling. Recently, due to strict privateering enforcement, salt smuggling has largely ceased, leading to significant economic hardship. They have become resentful of Fang Fangguan of Fangjia Dui, believing that recent seizures of salt smuggling cases were due to Fang's reports. Fangguan previously served as a privateer ship captain and had a grievance with salt smugglers in Xidui but had long since retired and remained at home. Unexpectedly, a group of salt smugglers captured and tied Fang to a prepared pile of firewood, doused him with oil, and burned him alive. Fangguan died in agonizing screams, turning into ashes. Onlookers were afraid to intervene. One villager who dared to say it was a sin was slapped several times. The smugglers retrieved a few pieces of bone fragments and some bloody intestines from the ashes, placed them in a boat-shaped wooden frame, covered it with a cloth awning, and released it into the sea, sailing away quickly. It is reported that Fangguan has two sons who are fortunately studying in other cities, remaining unharmed.</p>
<p>Huzhou: Tomb of状元 Land Runxiang Robbed</p>
<p>The tomb of the late 状元 Land Runxiang, located in Pan Village, near Lujiazhuang in the western countryside of this city, was robbed clean on the night of the 23rd. The coffin was in disarray, a pitiful sight. However, the remains were not scattered. Shi Ruosheng, the gravedigger, discovered the incident the following morning and reported it to Shen Zihe, the village head of Chengjing Township. On the 24th, village head Shen reported it to the Wu County government. The county government ordered the Ninth Public Security Bureau to conduct a strict investigation to solve the case.</p>

<p>Municipal News: Ministry of Finance to Issue Additional 20 Million Yuan in Treasury Bills</p>
<p>Entitled "National Treasury Certificates" with Monthly Interest of 2%</p>
<p>Pledge of Collateral by Banking and Financial Institutions to be Subject to Review</p>
<p>China News Agency reports that the Ministry of Finance is currently pursuing a three-pronged approach to maintain financial stability and provide relief to industry and commerce: (1) The original plan for providing relief loans to industry and commerce amounted to 20 million yuan, with 5 million yuan allocated for credit loans and 15 million yuan for mortgage loans. As industry and commerce found this allocation to be insufficient, they repeatedly requested an increase in the loan amount. It has now been decided to issue an additional 20 million yuan in the form of treasury bills, entitled "National Treasury Certificates" with a monthly interest rate of 2%, to facilitate the flow of funds in industry and commerce. As loans are repaid, the treasury bills will be gradually redeemed by the government. (2) Prior to the silver crisis, Chinese banks and financial institutions often relied on foreign capital to expand their operations, such as providing mortgage loans for real estate. With the decline in foreign capital and the worsening condition of real estate, mortgage loans cannot be recovered as planned, hindering the fluidity of capital turnover. To remedy this, representatives from the banking sector have formed a committee to review the existing mortgage loan portfolios of banks and financial institutions. Upon completion of the review, the mortgage deeds can be pledged to the Central Bank for a certain percentage in the form of financial public bonds. The Central Bank has allocated 25 million yuan in financial public bonds to provide relief to banking and financial institutions. (3) Bankruptcies of banks and financial institutions have been frequent in recent years, seriously undermining social credit and impacting national finances. To remedy this, the financial authorities have stipulated six measures: Banks and financial institutions that have already declared bankruptcy but have not completed liquidation must do so within three months from the date of the measures' promulgation. Banks and financial institutions declaring liquidation in the future must complete the liquidation process within three months from the date of declaration. Extensions will not be permitted without valid justification.</p>

<p>Arrival in Shanghai Yesterday</p>

<p>Chen Yi's Remarks</p>
<p>Chen met with reporters from various newspapers and stated that he has been in charge of the Fujian government for a year and a half. This trip is to report on the political situation in Fujian and does not involve any other tasks. Fujian is currently quite stable. Since he took office, the financial deficit has totaled one million yuan, and he is currently planning ways to make up for it to achieve a balanced budget. However, the central government also faces financial difficulties, so he has not yet requested assistance from the central government. The issuance of three million yuan in construction bonds in Fujian has been approved by the Legislative Yuan. Regarding construction, the focus is currently on roads. The highway from Yanping to Liancheng will be completed soon. He is scheduled to go to Nanjing tomorrow night (the 27th) to report to the Central Government. He will stay in Nanjing for at most one week. Whether he needs to go to Sichuan to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has not yet been decided.</p>
<p>Ambassador Cheng to Depart for Germany in August</p>
<p>China News Agency reports that the Executive Yuan's meeting the other day resolved to appoint Dr. Cheng Tianfang as the first plenipotentiary ambassador to Germany, which is a unique event in the history of recent diplomatic personnel administration and has attracted the attention of diplomatic circles.

<p>Cheng Tianfang and the Zhejiang Provincial Raw Silk Sales Association Host Silk Merchants Yesterday</p>
<p>Tan Xihong Delivers Speech Hoping for Cooperation</p>
<p>Huadong News Agency reports that Tan Xihong, Director of the Land Reclamation Department of the Ministry of Industry, has been acting as Chairman of the Sericulture Association of the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department since last month when the Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department went on official business. At 12:30 PM yesterday, he hosted a banquet for raw silk exporters at the Shanghai Banking Association Club. Those present included the Chairman of the Raw Silk Export Association and Manager Chuan Mali of the Italian Dafeng Foreign Firm, Manager Maitian of the French Xinfu Foreign Firm, Manager Ke Feide of the Swiss Dachang Firm, Assistant Manager Gao Longmu of the Tongyun Company, Director He Bingxian of the International Trade Bureau, Director Cai Wuji of the Commodity Inspection Bureau, Chairman Wu Shenbo of the Raw Silk Sales Association, and members of the Sericulture Control Association. During the banquet, Tan gave the following speech: "Ladies and gentlemen, I am very happy to meet with you today. Originally, Director Zeng was supposed to attend, but he was unable to attend due to official business. In the past month, I have been in charge. Everyone knows the management policy and implementation plan of the Zhejiang Provincial Sericulture Control Association. To improve China's sericulture industry, we must first improve silkworm breeding. We have enthusiastically worked hard, using scientific methods to plant mulberry trees, train farmers, and encourage and instruct them, resulting in considerable success. The production and quality of cocoons have surpassed the past. However, due to the bankruptcy of China's rural economy and the sluggishness of the foreign silk market, farmers have become extremely panicked, fearing that no one will buy their cocoons. Therefore, the government has stepped in to purchase cocoons and help farmers, organizing committees to revive the silk industry. As a result, the Zhejiang government has purchased more than 25% of the total cocoon production in Zhejiang. Now that the raw materials have been received, the second step is silk reeling. Therefore, a silk reeling committee has been organized, and I have been elected as the chairman. We have contacted and controlled ten silk factories, using more than 1,200 multi-spindle silk reeling machines, 1,500 new-style silk reeling machines, and 1,000 Italian silk reeling machines. The products of our committee will strive to be uniform and hope that the products can exceed the standards of all others. Mr. Wu Shenbo has been appointed as the chairman of the raw silk sales committee, with offices set up in the Sassoon Building in Shanghai, and Mr. Li Shuchu as the manager and Mr. Zhou Yuanxiang as the deputy manager, responsible for handling sales. This is in accordance with economic principles and the principle of division of labor and cooperation. This committee needs assistance in sales and transportation of products and profit. Most of those present today are leaders in raw silk export and occupy an important position in the raw silk trade. You are the links to New York, Lyon, and London. From now on, we can meet your needs as much as possible. We should cooperate vigorously and not have selfish spirits. We should serve honestly, so our relationship will be closer. Now, I wish the Zhejiang Provincial Sericulture Control Association and the Zhejiang Provincial Raw Silk Sales Committee to work hard to achieve our hopes." Fu Malijia gave a speech hoping that the exporters would assist Zhejiang in this movement and hoped that Jiangsu Province would also have the same movement. Finally, Wu Shenbo stood up and made a brief report. The banquet dispersed at about 2 o'clock.</p>
<p>Chinese纱厂 Cut Production to Maintain Status Quo</p>
<p>Auction of Japanese Yarn Decided to Start from January Next Year</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports that Chinese纱厂, due to the high price of cotton and the low price of yarn, are not only unable to make a profit, but are also losing money. Therefore, most are cutting production to maintain their status quo. As for the case of Japanese yarn joining the Chinese Exchange, it has been approved by the board of directors of the Exchange and is scheduled to be auctioned starting from January next year (auctioning the goods of the period of January 25th starting on August 1st of this year). The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Cotton Merchants Still Hope Cotton Prices Will Rise</p>
<p>After the spring every year, when the new cotton has not yet come out, the price of cotton gradually increases. This year, because there is too much stock from last year, the price of cotton has not only not risen but has also fallen. However, most cotton merchants, adhering to their old habits, are still reluctant to sell, hoping that the price will rise, so the price of cotton, although it has fallen, is still higher than the price of yarn. The Chinese yarn mills must lose at least five yuan or even fifteen yuan per package of yarn. In addition, the lack of purchasing power in the mainland and the large-scale dumping of Japanese yarn are all factors that affect the yarn market.</p>
<p>Various Factories Cut Production to Maintain the Status Quo</p>
<p>As a result, the纱厂 had no choice but to reduce production to barely maintain their status quo. Those who have implemented production cuts successively include Yong'an, Hongzhang, Shenxin, Hengfeng, Puyi, Hengda, Tongyi, and other纱厂. However, the degree of reduction is not uniform, but each factory handles it according to its own situation.</p>
<p>Decision to Auction Japanese Yarn</p>
<p>The Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange has decided on the case of Japanese紗廠 requesting to auction Japanese yarn. Because the futures for November of this year have already been auctioned, it is impossible for them to join halfway. Therefore, the board of directors of the exchange has decided to start auctioning from the January period of the 25th year. According to the exchange, futures are auctioned six months in advance, so the January futures of next year will be auctioned on August 1st of this year, but the delivery date must still wait until after the expiration date.</p>
<p>Japanese Yarn to be Sent to the Exchange for Review</p>
<p>Before the September 18th Incident in Shenyang in the 20th year of the Republic of China, Japanese yarn was originally auctioned at the Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange, and it was stopped only after the September 18th Incident. This time it is re-auctioned, and the board of directors of the exchange has already decided, and has sent a letter to the Japanese to send the brand, grade, sample, and standard price of the standard yarn to the exchange for review before joining the auction. It is now heard that the Japanese have agreed to send the sample to the exchange for review within two weeks. As for the exchange review personnel, they are a number of older people selected from various帮, such as Guangbang, Minbang, and Zhebang, to review it. Also, fearing that the various items opened in the sample may not be fully compliant, according to the rules, it is necessary to purchase a number of Japanese yarns of the same brand and price to prove whether the sample sent is accurate. Then, the confidential one will be the standard yarn, and the auction price will be based on this as the standard.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu's Condition Gradually Improves</p>
<p>China News Agency reports that Mayor Wu previously took a leave of absence for health reasons. According to municipal government sources, Mayor Wu suffered from bone pain, which had not occurred for many years. Recently, he suffered from toothache and other illnesses, and the old illness recurred. He has been carefully diagnosed and treated by Dr. 布美 and is gradually recovering. However, the bone pain has not been reduced, so he still needs to recuperate for a few days before returning to work.</p>
<p>Minsheng Industrial Company's Minxian Steamer Sinks</p>
<p>The Accident Location is Jigung Stone Upstream of Yichang</p>
<p>Full Cargo Sinks, Passengers and Crew Rescued</p>
<p>The Minsheng Industrial Steamship Company's Minxian steamship, sailing on the Yichang-Chongqing route, suddenly hit a reef in the waters near Jigung Stone, downstream of Zigui and upstream of Yichang (in Hubei Province), between 9:00 and 10:00 AM this past Tuesday (the 25th). The entire ship sank within seven minutes. Fortunately, the crew and passengers were all rescued. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>History of the Minxian</p>
<p>The Minxian was built by the Jiangnan Shipyard and completed in 1925. It is 153 feet long, 29 feet wide, and 7 feet deep, with a gross tonnage of 663 tons and a net tonnage of 411 tons. It has a cotton yarn cargo capacity of 1,200 pieces, a draft of 6 feet, and a horsepower of 1,600. Its speed is 14 nautical miles per hour. It has 4 first-class cabins, 4 second-class cabins, and 8 third-class cabins. The ship was originally named Wan'an and owned by the Zhongxing Company. In 1931, it was purchased by the Minsheng Company at a price and operated on the Yichang-Chongqing route, and occasionally on the Shanghai-Chongqing route. The current captain is named Zhang Bingrong.</p>
<p>Hits Reef and Sinks</p>
<p>The ship departed from Yichang at 6:00 AM on the 25th, fully loaded with passengers and cargo, bound for Chongqing. Unexpectedly, when sailing to Jigung Stone, downstream of Zigui and upstream of Yichang (in Hubei Province), the ship suddenly hit a reef. Despite efforts to save it, the rapid river currents made it impossible to escape danger. The entire ship sank within seven minutes. Fortunately, the ship had thorough safety equipment, so all passengers and crew were safely rescued without any injuries.</p>
<p>Cause of the Accident</p>
<p>The Shanghai branch received a telegram about the accident at 4:00 PM yesterday. The telegram was brief and did not mention the cause of the accident or the extent of the damage. Therefore, the details are still unknown. However, company personnel speculate that the upper reaches of the Yangtze River have many shoals and reefs. If navigation is not careful, there is a risk of hitting a reef. Currently, it is the flood season, and the river currents are rapid, making rescue extremely difficult when a reef is hit. The speed at which the ship sank further proves the difficulty of rescue. As for the issue of responsibility for the accident, it will be clarified after the head office conducts a detailed investigation. This information is currently unknown.</p>
<p>Estimated Loss</p>
<p>The ship was fully loaded with passengers and cargo on this trip from Yichang to Chongqing. After the accident, in addition to all the passengers and crew being rescued due to the ship's safety equipment, all the cargo on board sank with the ship. Although there is no accurate estimate of the loss, it is estimated to be several hundred thousand yuan, a shocking amount. The company has notified various shipping merchants so that those who have insurance can negotiate compensation with the underwriting company.</p>
<p>Aftermath Measures</p>
<p>The Shanghai branch has not yet received a telegram from the head office regarding the aftermath. However, it is known that the ship was insured with the 北滿洲 Insurance Company for 100,000 yuan. After the accident, the company has notified the 北滿洲 Insurance Company to send personnel to the scene of the accident to investigate everything.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Compiles Next Year's Budget</p>
<p>Construction Costs Determined Not to be Reduced</p>
<p>The Municipal Government's budget for the 24th year was previously organized by Secretary-General Yu and others into a budget compilation committee to start compiling the budget. However, because the income was not enough to cover the expenses, it was proposed to calculate the seed business costs and administrative costs, except for official expenses and health expenses, at 90%. However, after this principle was determined, various bureaus stated that various constructions in the city were being actively promoted, and that this year was the year of social construction, and that all social construction should be valued. Mayor Wu also believes that if various business costs are calculated at 90%, it will make the progress of various construction undertakings difficult. Therefore, the city government Secretary-General Yu Hongjun and the Finance Bureau Director Cai Zengji are busy revising the budget to ensure that the progress of various construction undertakings is not hindered.</p>
<p>Huang Boqiao Drafts Inspection Report</p>
<p>Regularly Hosts Press to Report on Inspection Process</p>
<p>Scheduled to Return to Work in Early Next Month After a Short Rest</p>
<p>Huang Boqiao, Director of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration, was previously ordered by the Ministry of Railways to inspect railway undertakings in Europe and the United States. He has now completed his mission and returned to Shanghai on the 北德 Company's Xianghuosituo steamer the night before. Huang's old illness was completely cured after being treated in Austria, so his spirit is more vigorous than before he left the country. Huang needs to rest for a while due to the fatigue of the journey, and is scheduled to return to work on the first of next month. He is currently drafting a report to describe the inspection process and plans to go to Nanjing to report everything to the Minister of Railways in person within days. Before going to Nanjing, he plans to host the press on a regular basis to talk about the inspection process and his feelings.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce's 6th General Meeting Resolves to Sanction Those in the Same Trade Who Do Not Join the Guild</p>
<p>Submits a Request to Supplement and Amend Sanction Measures</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce submitted a report to the Ministry of Industry of the Executive Yuan yesterday, stating: "Submitting a report for the matter of application. At the sixth general meeting of members held by the Chamber on June 23, the Fire Hose Industry Association proposed that the government be requested to force members of the same trade to join the association. (The original proposal is omitted) It is found that the implementation method for forcing members of the same trade to join the association was previously instructed by the Ministry of Industry (鈞) on October 6 of last year with No. 29109, stating that there is no freedom not to join the association according to law, and Article 7, Item 1, Clause 5 of the Guild Law, the so-called joining the association refers to the provisions for joining the association, and if a business does not fulfill this procedure, it cannot be exempted from its due obligations, and can file a lawsuit in court according to law. The association submitted a report to the Ministry of Industry (鈞) on April 15, requesting that the meaning of the instruction be included in the implementation rules, so that each guild can apply to the court for a lawsuit according to the implementation rules in the event of such incidents, and can also formulate punishment methods by the guild itself according to the implementation rules. It has been a long time and no instructions have been received, so the above-mentioned incidents are still impossible to handle. Considering the intention of 鈞院 (Ministry) to be cautious and hesitant, such as the previous instructions, which are considered to restrict the freedom of the people, and the nature of which is inconvenient to be stipulated in the implementation rules, in order to implement the spirit of Article 7 of the current Same Trade Guild Law, clear sanction methods should still be supplemented in the Same Trade Guild Law, so that the provision will not be in vain. After discussion at the general meeting, it was resolved to immediately submit a report to the government for prompt adoption and implementation. It is reasonable to record the case and submit it to 鈞院 (Ministry) for review and approval and transfer it to the Executive Yuan (consulting) the Legislative Yuan to supplement the above-mentioned sanction methods in Article 7 of the Same Trade Guild Law, so as to comply with it consistently, and it is more than expected to await orders.

<p>Various Banks Settle Accounts at the End of June, Unrelated to Market Conditions</p>
<p>Purely Internal Profit and Loss Accounting of Various Banks</p>
<p>Three Banks Transfer Silver to Wuhan to Stabilize Finance</p>
<p>Xinxin News Agency reports that the banking industry in this city stipulates that the end of June and the end of December every year are the settlement and accounting periods. However, this settlement is unrelated to the financial market. This kind of settlement is completely different from the settlement of the Qian industry. All loans are not limited to the regulations for recovery, but only the internal accounts are totaled to know the exact amount of profit and loss, and the dividends are paid. There is no problem for market finance. According to financial circles, in order to respond to the needs of the branches in Wuhan and help stabilize the financial market in Wuhan, the banks in this port, Central, China, and Transportation, once negotiated and decided to allocate funds to transfer to Wuhan. The Bank of China and the Bank of Communications will each transport 500,000 yuan to Wuhan first, and the Central Bank will transport it later when needed. It is expected that the finance in Wuhan, after the aid of the three banks, can be stable as usual.</p>

<p>Li and Wang Arrive in Shanghai from Beijing; Simplified Characters to be Promoted Nationwide; Phonetic Type Matrices to be Signed and Cast Today; Implementation Measures Submitted to Minister Wang for Approval</p>
<p>Li Jinxi and Wang Yi, members of the National Language Unification Committee of the Ministry of Education, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning and stayed at the Huizhong Hotel. Shanghai News reporters paid a special visit to Mr. Li to inquire about the mission in Shanghai and the promotion of simplified characters. He spoke in detail, as follows:</p>
<p>Li and Wang Arrive in Shanghai as Representatives to Sign</p>
<p>Mr. Li began by saying that the Ministry of Education had allocated 10,000 this year in March for the casting of bronze matrices for phonetic Chinese characters. This was approved by the administrative meeting and entrusted to the Shanghai Zhonghua Book Company for casting. The original contract stipulated in Article 5 (first produce sizes 2 and 3; deliver four pieces of size 3 five months after the phonetic symbols are written, engraved, inspected, and signed). Now the phonetic symbols have been written and engraved, and the first batch of Chinese characters to be cast has been selected by the National Language Committee to be approximately 5,000 characters, including over 3,700 of the most commonly used characters and over 1,300 of the next most commonly used characters. The company will first cast bronze phonetic matrices in the Fangsong typeface sizes 2 and 3 for use in mass literacy and righteous translations. He is scheduled to represent the Ministry of Education on the 27th to inspect and sign the contract, and casting will begin immediately.</p>
<p>Discussion of Simplified Characters</p>
<p>Mr. Li continued that he (Mr. Li referring to himself) and Mr. Wang went to Beijing on the 15th, and the first batch of simplified characters handwritten by Qian Xuantong of the committee, totaling more than 2,440 characters, were rewritten in regular script, photographed, and printed as the first draft of simplified characters. The official meeting was held on the 20th. The meeting was originally scheduled to be chaired by Vice Minister Duan (Xipeng), but due to his busy schedule, it was chaired by Director Zhang (Jiong) of the Social Affairs Department. A total of nine people attended, including Mr. Li, Mr. Wang, Section Chief Zhong (Lingxiu) of the Social Affairs Department, staff member Gu (Liangjie), Section Chief Wu (Yanyin) of the Ordinary Affairs Department, Zhao Yuanren of the Academia Sinica, and Pan Zunxing of the National Compilation and Translation Bureau. The discussion lasted three days, and the meeting concluded on the afternoon of the 2nd. The resolutions have now been sorted out, and more than 1,200 characters have been selected for casting printing bronze matrices. In addition, 14 items of "Simplified Character Principles and Implementation Measures" and a (Simplified Character Radical System Table) of over 500 characters have been drafted and submitted to Minister Wang for approval and implementation.</p>
<p>Key Points of Simplified Character Principles</p>
<p>Mr. Li then stated that the main purpose of simplified characters is to facilitate writing quickly for the general public. Therefore, on the one hand, commonly used vulgar characters (i.e., so-called handwritten characters) are adopted, and on the other hand, cursive handwriting methods are used. Most cursive handwriting methods are simplifications of radicals and parts, with systematic regulations (such as the "speech" radical being written as "之" on the left and "言" at the bottom; the system is listed in the radical table). Vulgar characters are mostly the most commonly used characters, but they often do not follow the radical system in custom. Because they are already very common and mostly inherit from the Song and Yuan dynasties, they are also considered not to deviate from the principle of "narrating and not creating." However, whether ancient or modern, Chinese or foreign, characters are generally divided into two forms: a printed form, which focuses on neatness and density, and a handwritten form, which focuses on simplicity and connectivity. Not to mention other countries, in China, from the Qin and Han dynasties to the present, literati, scholars, farmers, merchants, and the general public all use vulgar cursive handwriting in daily applications, and almost no one writes according to the printed form. This is a fact. Based on this fact, the government's selection of simplified characters aims to unify the current handwritten form of characters, that is, to recognize the commonly used vulgar characters and to standardize the cursive calligraphy that varies from person to person. In education, it is to improve the handwriting curriculum in schools and mass education. In other words, it is to require all officials and people across the country to learn cursive writing instead of regular script and to learn commonly written simplified characters instead of officially written complex characters. This unification and improvement is limited to the handwritten form and has nothing to do with the printed form. The official complex characters in the printed form must still be recognized for reading, which goes without saying. However, there are many Chinese characters, unlike other countries that use only a few thousand letters to spell words. Therefore, it is difficult for other countries to have both handwritten and printed forms, while in China, educators fear increasing the burden on children. Therefore, this first batch of simplified characters will temporarily break through the boundaries between the two forms. There are three key points: (1) All cursive handwriting methods are temporarily written in regular script, that is, the hooks are broken, and the round turns are squared; (2) Although beginners cannot learn cursive writing, they must prepare for cursive writing after becoming proficient. Therefore, although the strokes are broken, they still retain the connected momentum. Although the handwriting is squared, it becomes round and turned when familiar. This point will be extremely efficient in future applications; (3) The overall appearance of the characters must be selected so that the difference between the two forms is not far (except for vulgar characters).</p>
<p>Outline of Simplified Character Promotion</p>
<p>Mr. Li also said that textbooks for short-term literacy education and mass education should adopt the 1,200 simplified characters "cast into type matrices" to replace the official characters, with the official characters annotated in the new word column for reference. As for whether formal elementary school textbooks should also use simplified characters to replace the official characters according to the above method, it is up to the Ministry of Education to decide. This simplified printing type matrix should uniformly cast phonetic symbols next to the characters. In addition to selecting and casting printing type matrices for the first batch of simplified characters, the drafter should write a thorough copy, with the official characters annotated below each character, called the "Simplified Character Table," which will be proofread and printed by the National Language Unification Committee, submitted to the ministry for promulgation, and adopted as a handwriting model for schools and mass education across the country. At the same time, it will serve as the standard style for printing type matrices. After the selection and promulgation of the first batch of simplified characters, the ministry will be requested to issue an order to schools and mass education institutions across the country that all written texts may use these simplified characters to replace the official characters. In all readings, where simplified characters can be used instead, the official characters only need to be recognized for reading and do not need to be memorized and written in the teaching process.</p>
<p>The Interconnectedness of Phonetic Symbols and Simplified Characters</p>
<p>According to Mr. Li's opinion, simplified characters and phonetic Chinese characters should be promoted at the same time. Therefore, the two things are like two wheels of a car and two wings of a bird. Simplified characters facilitate writing, and phonetic Chinese characters facilitate reading. If either is missing, it will be deformed and unable to move forward. Although simplified characters are easier to write, they are as difficult to recognize as official characters in terms of learning psychology. If all printed materials are not uniformly printed in phonetic Chinese characters, the efficiency of reading cannot be increased, and having to recognize both forms of each character will increase the burden on reading. Only by annotating each character with phonetic symbols can this new force be added to recognition and reading, and then the rapid writing efficiency of simplified characters can be highlighted. Otherwise, this reform of writing tools to facilitate education will be like a single wheel or a single wing, and its power will be extremely weak. However, the world must recognize that both of these things are promoting Chinese characters and have nothing to do with reforming characters. They are merely improvements to the teaching tools of Chinese characters, he said. It is said that Mr. Li and Mr. Wang will return to Beijing in a day or two and then return to Peiping.</p>
<p>The Municipal Secondary School and Teacher Training School Graduation Joint Exam Ended Successfully Yesterday</p>
<p>The grading has begun and results will be announced in about two weeks. Regulations for promotion and service for those who fail.</p>
<p>The municipal secondary school and physical education teacher training school graduation joint exam for the 23rd academic year, second semester, which began on the 24th of this month, ended successfully yesterday. The grading has begun. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Grading Begins</p>
<p>The order at the exam venue was very good on the last day yesterday. Junior high school and teacher training school exams ended in the morning, and senior high school exams ended in the afternoon. All exam papers are stored at the office of the Lake Society Exam Committee. The grading committee members for each subject began grading at the office yesterday. Due to the large number of participants in this joint exam, the grading is quite time-consuming. Work is currently being intensified, and the grading will be completed and announced in about two weeks at the latest.</p>
<p>Calculating Grades</p>
<p>The method for calculating the grades of each subject in this year's graduation joint exam is as follows: the average of the school's graduation grades for each subject, that is, the average of the grades for three academic years, accounts for 40%, and the grades for each subject in the joint exam account for 60%. The combined grade will be used for calculations. All grades will be calculated using a percentage system. Decimals less than whole numbers will be rounded off. Grades from 80 to 100 will be considered A, 70 to 79 will be considered B, 60 to 69 will be considered C, and less than 60 will be considered D and a failing grade. The school's grades will be ranked into four levels (A, B, C, D) based on the percentage of graduating students from each school who participated in the joint exam. Then, the average of the scores of students from each school in the joint exam will be divided into four levels (A, B, C, D).</p>
<p>Promotion and Service</p>
<p>Only those who pass all subjects in the graduation joint exam can graduate. Those who fail three or more subjects will be held back. Those who cannot be held back due to special circumstances may be given a study certificate by the original school, stamped with the seal of the graduation joint exam failure. Those who fail one or two subjects may continue to participate in the joint exam for those subjects in the next two years. Only after passing can they graduate. If they still fail a subject, they must take all subjects in the joint exam again. Those who fail one or two subjects but wish to continue their studies will be issued a certificate of admission to higher education by the Education Bureau, allowing them to continue their studies as probationary students. Only after passing the joint exam for each subject and obtaining a graduation certificate will they be allowed to participate in the final semester exam or graduation exam of the school they have been admitted to. Those who fail one or two subjects in the teacher training school joint exam may be temporarily allowed to serve. Only after obtaining a graduation certificate will they be qualified to serve formally. Those who wish to continue their studies or serve in other provinces or cities may have the student request their original school to submit a request to the Education Bureau to forward it to the relevant educational administrative organ in the place where they wish to study or serve, allowing them to participate in the local graduation joint exam and take the exam for those subjects.</p>

<p>Free Talk on Victor Hugo's Humanitarianism by Wang Jicong</p>
<p>Victor Hugo, known as the "Eternal Father" of French literature, would have been 50 years deceased this June. Europe and Japan have held grand commemorations to honor this giant of French Romanticism. Speaking of French Romanticism, the writers gathered under that banner represent two fundamentally different types: one is linked to the declining aristocracy, such as Vigny, Musset, and George Sand; the other opposes the aristocracy, represented by Victor Hugo, whom we will discuss here. However, Hugo is not only the foremost of the anti-aristocratic Romantics but also a humanitarian. He strove to oppose the death penalty, for the sake of "humanity." In all his works, he showed boundless sympathy for the oppressed and the impoverished. However, the result was only to advise people to be good, without clearly pointing out a practically viable path for everyone. He didn't care what the driving force of social development was, or the essence of human life's competition. He simply stood under the banner of humanitarianism, hoping that the strong would care for the weak, that the rich would have compassion for the poor, and that the wicked would do good. In "Leaves of Autumn," he advised the wealthy: "Always let joy blossom before the steps of your doors for the poor, so that they can see the kindness and care of a refuge there." In "The Dance at the City Council Hall," he "appealed to the authorities: to eradicate poverty, so that everyone can be happy." In the long novel "The Man Who Laughs," he used the mouth of Gwynplaine, the protagonist and former nobleman turned clown, to say to the aristocratic rich: "You should have pity on those who are harmed, and help those who are poor." All of these can fully demonstrate the humanitarian spirit of the great writer Victor Hugo.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, Victor Hugo's most famous work is "Les Misérables"; but in his works, the most intense color of humanitarianism is probably in "Les Misérables." In the preface to this famous work, he said: "Because of law and custom, a form of social damnation exists in the present time, which artificially creates a kind of hell on earth in the midst of civilization, and complicates the holy destiny with all human ills; the three great problems of our age—the degradation of man by proletarianism, the prostitution of woman by starvation, and the dwarfing of childhood by physical and spiritual night—are not yet solved; while, in certain regions, social asphyxia is possible; in other words, and from a still wider point of view, while ignorance and misery exist on earth, books like this cannot be useless." Thus, Hugo's "Les Misérables" was written to explain and solve the "three great problems" that existed in society at the time. However, he did not delve into the root of these problems, did not find the fundamental reasons for their occurrence, and therefore did not reveal practical solutions to the problems. He truthfully and vividly depicted the cruelty of war, the unreasonableness of the laws of the time, and the hypocrisy of ascetics in monasteries in this great work. But he does not advocate solving these problems with practical action; his central consciousness is to persuade people to be good, as if good deeds can solve all problems. In fact, the protagonist of the novel he worked hard to describe, Jean Valjean, was originally a wicked thief, who later, under the influence of the "virtue" of Bishop Myriel, who was "as merciful as God," changed himself into a diligent and hardworking good person, and became a "good" rich man. He rescued prostitutes, distributed his property to the poor, and when it came to "revenge" on the enemy who had captured him, he released him: such a description and praise of the humanitarian spirit of reforming evil and doing good can indeed be compared to the religious writer Tolstoy.</p>
<p>However, Hugo is the foremost of French Romanticism, not a realist novelist, and his humanitarianism is undoubtedly dressed in the colorful clothing of Romanticism. At the same time, he is still a petty-bourgeois writer who opposes the aristocracy, so his humanitarianism is also petty-bourgeois. He loves freedom and respects human rights. For this reason, he not only wrote many works but also actively participated in political movements. Take his "Les Misérables" as an example. The entrepreneur in it rises from being a wicked thief. He does not exploit the toiling masses; he is the "father" of the toiling masses. His only responsibility is to save and love people. Such an entrepreneur is born from the petty-bourgeois ideal of humanitarianism. Although this ideal entrepreneur does not exist in the real world, those actual entrepreneurs also often boast of their "virtues" with their "good deeds" to use them as a guise to dazzle others. Lan Sheng once said that "Les Misérables" is "the democratic poem of humanitarianism produced when faced squarely with the self-interested citizens, the suffering people who are bullied and exploited, the vices of people in social circles, and the virtues of outcasts, prisoners, and prostitutes." In a way, I think this is a proper assessment of "Les Misérables."</p>
<p>When the great event of the Paris Commune occurred in 1871, Hugo was in Belgium. He expressed his opposition to this event, and when the event failed and those who participated in the event were massacred, he expressed his dissatisfaction with this massacre and actively campaigned for the amnesty of those who participated in the event. In this incident, his change of attitude can also demonstrate his hatred of cruelty and his good heart for caring for humanity; but ultimately, his good heart is still beneficial in protecting the existence of the bourgeois society of France at that time.</p>
<p>"To sympathize with the oppressors, even the wise will turn into fools." The so-called "humanitarian" is one who superficially sympathizes with the oppressed masses and hates the oppressors, and therefore contains a part of the truth. Although Hugo did not propose effective solutions to solve the problems he saw, and his Romantic humanitarianism was petty-bourgeois and objectively beneficial to entrepreneurs, because he truthfully described those unreasonable social phenomena he saw and bravely raised those social issues, and gave sincere and great sympathy to "the suffering people who are bullied and exploited," all his works can still move people greatly and make people shed tears, and therefore are still works of great artistic value. If the prevalence of his humanitarian solution to problems in his works somewhat hurts the value of his works, then his truthful description of many social phenomena in order to enhance the effectiveness of his humanitarianism, and his sincere and great sympathy for those "suffering people who are bullied and exploited," are the reasons why his works have great artistic value.</p>
<p>Central Street Flavors by Fei'er</p>
<p>Singapore Impressions, Part One</p>
<p>Every day, I nestle in a high-rise building. I use a mat as a chair and a stool as a desk. I open a book or write horizontal lines on a notebook. Morning, noon, and dusk, the cook's shout joins the clamor around a large round table. I wash my own bowls and chopsticks and join a dozen people for a meal. In front of the store, rows of shops raise disputes over prices and the roar of trucks. Behind the store, the coolies in the warehouses sweat and shout powerfully. All around: scales, saliva, sweat, the sound of money...</p>
<p>Going to the Raffles Library, or returning from the library, I nestle in a high-rise building. All around is the noise of the city, the clamor and the shouting.</p>
<p>The entire Central Street has dozens of coffee shops. Every day, the steam of hot coffee and the mist of cold ice water rise. Holding a book, one can calmly observe the faces of all kinds of people, the topics and gestures of their conversations amidst the lively chatter. Here, all aspects of life are exposed; here, excellent materials for writing are buried. Young shop owners tell me of hunting romances, middle-aged clerks repeatedly complain to me about their hardships, and coolies give me strong smiles, sometimes pounding the table with their fists and uttering impassioned sentences. Old friends who have just come from the homeland shake their heads as they tell me stories of their hometowns, and new friends from old overseas communities sigh to me about the misfortune of the overseas Chinese...</p>
<p>To the west, it leads to Raffles Square, where many beautiful cars are parked. Banks and trading companies raise their tall facades high. To the east, at the intersection of Central Street, the old "Pasar" has curry beef rice, where the sighs and bitter smiles of life are squeezed together in the hot steam. Further east, there is the sea. There are ships, the roar of the sea; there are splashes of water, and the tears of wanderers.</p>
<p>At night, the bustling Central Street is dead. The drunkards have returned, the hunters have also returned. All around are the huge snores or the quiet whispers of night talks. The night sinks down, down into silence. The tropical autumn wind blows. On the rooftop floor, each red blanket wraps each body like a corpse.</p>
<p>From here, I hear the sound of gunfire from the northeast, and from here, I smell the breath of the nation sinking down.</p>
<p>Striving to pull myself out of Central Street, I head for Penang, only to be thrown into the ocean again and rolled back to my homeland. The impression of Central Street has not faded to this day.</p>
<p>Diagnosis by Zhou Wen</p>
<p>The illness had dragged on for too long. Finally, I made the biggest decision and went to a big hospital with Yun. When I got out of the rickshaw and stepped into the gate, I started arguing with Yun again:</p>
<p>"Yun, you must also get checked. Don't be so stubborn."</p>
<p>Yun brushed the long hair near her ears with her fingers, smiled, and said:</p>
<p>"Forget it, you're talking about it again. Don't we only have this little money left? My body is not bad. Don't worry, I won't really get infected."</p>
<p>"No, you've been coughing up more phlegm these past few days, and you've been eating less. You must..."</p>
<p>Before I finished speaking, Yun pouted and turned her head away.</p>
<p>"See? Didn't I tell you? The moment I say it, you get angry. That's a symptom of lung disease." I said, patting her shoulder.</p>
<p>Fortunately, unexpectedly, the ordinary registration fee was only ten cents. After sending a two-dime banknote to the counter with a sign that said "Registration," I had two square white cards printed with lead type in my hand: "Lung Disease Consultation Ticket." Yun didn't say anything anymore, but pursed her lips and smiled.</p>
<p>Outside the door of the lung disease clinic, leaning against the railing, were already two pale-faced, thin men holding square white cards, coughing and choking, their faces becoming even paler; which made my throat itchy, and I coughed once too. The two of them turned their heads in surprise and saw Yun and I standing at the door. They immediately frowned, lowered their faces, left the railing, and squeezed to the door, glaring at us with sideways glances. Fortunately, the door of the clinic opened with a "creak," and a female nurse with a white cloth shaped like a dustpan on the back of her head, raised her head and called out three numbers in a row; I picked up the card and saw that my number was there, so we followed her in.</p>
<p>It was a large room, and two patients were standing in front of tables in two corners of the room putting on their clothes. Two doctors wearing white coats were hunched over their desks, moving their pens on white paper. When we walked closer, the doctor on the left suddenly stood up, handed a piece of paper with many foreign words written on it to the patient who had finished dressing in front of him, and said in a hoarse voice:</p>
<p>"Have an X-ray taken, today is a good day to do it. Don't delay any longer, your illness is..."</p>
<p>Yun suddenly tugged at my sleeve and said:</p>
<p>"Let's go to the room inside. That's what the nurse said."</p>
<p>We had just walked to the door when we saw the door open and a woman with permed hair walking out, holding a piece of white paper also filled with foreign words in her hand. — Oh, this is the women's clinic, I thought.</p>
<p>A doctor with greasy hair was standing in front of a table by the window, with his hands in the pockets of his white coat, raising his head and staring at Yun at first glance. He nodded, took the two consultation tickets from my hand, sat down, and copied the names on the consultation tickets onto a piece of white paper. After a while, he tilted his head, raised his eyebrows, stared at Yun with both eyes, and asked:</p>
<p>"Where do you feel uncomfortable?"</p>
<p>"I seem to have phlegm these past two days."</p>
<p>"Do you cough?" He suddenly stared at a red fountain pen he was playing with on the table. There was some dust stuck to the very new gold nib. So he asked, while extending a fingertip to wipe it.</p>
<p>"I don't cough."</p>
<p>"Are you eating well?"</p>
<p>"These past few days!" Yun moved her eyes and hesitated for a moment.</p>
<p>The doctor pursed his lips, blew a breath at the nib, and eagerly asked:</p>
<p>"Do you have a fever?"</p>
<p>He suddenly stood up, frowned, looked at the gold watch on his hand, said something to a female nurse standing in front of him, then put both hands in the pockets of his coat, raised his head, raised his eyebrows, and said:</p>
<p>"Take off your clothes."</p>
<p>When it came to the examination, he didn't seem to be sloppy. His left palm moved up and down Yun's bare back, and the two bent fingers of his right hand kept tapping on the back of his left palm, tapping again and again, and he also tilted his ears close to the fingers he was tapping, for several minutes.</p>
<p>"How is she?" When the doctor sat back at the table, I couldn't help but ask. He closed his mouth for a while, frowned, and then tilted his head and said:</p>
<p>"Her lungs are not very good."</p>
<p>"What's wrong with them?"</p>
<p>"I think she needs a more precise examination. Her left lung is very...very...very... But I can't completely decide just by looking at it like this. The most important thing is to have an X-ray taken. This kind of illness can't be taken lightly."</p>
<p>I got anxious and asked him how much it would cost to have an X-ray taken.</p>
<p>"Sixteen dollars. Our hospital is a charitable organization, so it's much cheaper than other hospitals. It would be best to have it taken today."</p>
<p>As he said that, he picked up his pen and wrote on a piece of white paper. The last two were the Arabic numerals 16.</p>
<p>Finally, it was my turn to have my body examined. When he stretched out his finger and tapped my chest twice, his eyes suddenly discovered the gold watch on his left wrist again, and he frowned and turned to look at the door. I was holding my breath waiting for him to tap my breasts; but he took out the stethoscope, put it in his ears, and poked my back three times with the tube. He frowned again and looked at the gold watch on his hand, then put the stethoscope in his pocket and walked towards the table.</p>
<p>"Sir, how is mine?" I asked anxiously, while putting on my clothes.</p>
<p>"Your lungs are not very good," he said. Just then, the door opened, and the nurse who had just gone out came in again. The voices of the two doctors in the outer room talking to the patients squeezed in from behind her!</p>
<p>"You should have an X-ray taken."</p>
<p>"Your left lung is not very..."</p>
<p>The door closed, and the sound was suddenly shut out again.</p>
<p>I anxiously watched the doctor finish talking to the nurse, and then asked:</p>
<p>"How are my lungs not good?"</p>
<p>"It's the right side, here." He pointed a finger at my chest. "Very bad. I think you should still have—" He suddenly stood up, hurriedly called out to the nurse who had already stepped out of the door, said a word, and then sat down again to finish his words:</p>
<p>"You should still have an X-ray taken." He glanced at me, saw that I had nothing to say, and then wrote on another piece of paper, ending with the two Arabic numerals 16. I was a little angry and asked:</p>
<p>"Whose is more serious, hers or mine?"</p>
<p>"Hers is more serious," he answered, looking at the tip of the pen in his hand. "But yours is also serious. But only an X-ray can examine it in detail." As he spoke, he handed me the two pieces of white paper filled with foreign words, his eyes looking at the doorway that had been opened for a moment—at which time a thin man with a pale face, also holding a square white card, was coming in. He immediately took the card from that person's hand, and we had no choice but to step out of the door.</p>

<p>University Days (10) (2)</p>
<p>By Theodor Storm</p>
<p>Translated by Chen Yinzhi</p>
<p>I also slipped away for quite a while to go to serve Nali, but couldn't think of how to propose it to her in the most polite way. Because every time when I approached her, she would apparently avoid me and hide among other people. At this time the apprentice came pushing the sled back. "Now it's Nalina's turn!" someone said this sentence; but Nali didn't want to sit on it. "Bartel should go and drink something first," she said, and put some money in the apprentice's hand.</p>
<p>I didn't hear very clearly, but I had already thought of the plan. I pretended to be nonchalant and ran to the tent as hard as I could. When I was about to reach the tent, Fritz's mother shouted at me. "Philip," she said, with a bit of joking spirit, and used a dog finger to point to the side I was running to, "If you want to catch Nali, -- she's there!"</p>
<p>"Of course I want to catch her!" I shouted, and slipped past.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes; but she doesn't want to pay attention to you young masters anymore!"</p>
<p>I had already run far when I heard this sentence. I had already stood in front of the big tent selling wine. Before long Bartel also walked to that place,, but I had already used all the money I had to buy him a cup of sugar wine and a butter bread with sausage in it and put it there. "You try it," I put these two things in front of him, "Those little girls have made you too tired!一</p>
<p>The child was eating and drinking very deliciously, so I dared to go further to entice him. "Bartel, I'll take your place to push the sled once, would you like that?"</p>
<p>He used his hand to wipe the sweat beads from his forehead, and continued to quietly bite the bread; it was only when I told him the method that he nodded to indicate that he understood what I meant. After he finished eating, he went back to his group of people; before long I saw Nali still wearing a black silk fur headscarf, with both hands in her little hand warmer, sitting inside the sled, Bartel clumsily slowly pushing along the lake. — When they rushed out from the crowd, I slid my smooth skates towards them. In just a little while, my hand was put on the sled, and the apprentice stayed behind and didn't follow. I was so happy that I wanted to shout out, but I bit my gums tightly, and the light sled flew past on the sparkling ice surface as if it had wings.</p>
<p>"Bartel, you're simply flying!" Nali said.</p>

<p>Local Supplement of Shen Bao Discusses the Value of Life by Qiong Sheng</p>
<p>It is often said by general health experts that life has supreme value. Once an individual's life ends in death, everything is lost. Only by preserving life can one talk about careers and happiness, as the saying goes, "While the green hills remain, there'll always be wood to burn." Thus, in addition to living in comfort and luxury, one must think of every possible method to "prolong life," or even search for various "youth-restoring techniques" and "elixirs from the sea," hoping to achieve immortality. In the eyes of this group of people, life does indeed have supreme value.</p>
<p>However, this is only the case for a small portion of people. For those who not only cannot feel the happiness of life but also find life difficult, the situation is vastly different. The recent report from Renji Hospital reveals this festering situation. After describing that the hospital had 631 suicide cases from January to May this year, a fivefold increase compared to last year, the report went on to say: What is the market value of a person's life? The answer is shockingly low. There was a strong man who, due to unemployment, became a street vendor, but faced adversity and became a beggar. Eventually, he had only one basket left, which he used to buy arsenic and commit suicide. After being rescued, he was given a small sum of four dollars and fifty cents, and within a month, he was able to make a living with it. This is the price of a person's life. Another woman did the same, requiring only one dollar and fifty cents for medical expenses, and was able to temporarily save her family. Isn't this astonishing?</p>
<p>It is absurd to "value" a person's life "according to market price," weighing it by the pound. However, when the value of human life is estimated to be so low, it truly evokes a sense of being "inferior to dogs and pigs." Of course, the reason we are saddened is not the difference between whose life is worth a few dollars and cents and whose is worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, but rather this "tertiary syphilis rushing to the top of the head" type of festering situation in current society. This is to say that the extravagance of many people's carriages, horses, travels, and banquets is, in this disparate state, the "price of life" for millions of people. This cruel contrast truly demonstrates the life of enjoyment and the death of sorrow among people!</p>
<p>June Festival in the Village by Simon</p>
<p>The heavens seemed to be deliberately obstructing these families, and on days when rain was unnecessary, it poured endlessly as if piercing through the belly, so that within a day or two, all the fields were filled with a boundless expanse of water, overflowing over the ridges and wastefully flowing into the rivers and ponds. This is the season for planting rice seedlings! Wouldn't it be better if this happened a little later?</p>
<p>People felt a bit regretful that the rain was falling at the wrong time.</p>
<p>The rain kept falling, and the rice seedlings almost didn't even sprout. People could only plant seedlings when there was a break in the dry weather, and after the seedlings were planted, it was precisely the season when a large amount of rain was needed. But the heavens became stingy, and not a single drop of rain fell. The sky always had that coppery face, as if frozen. The rain seemed to have been drained earlier, and at the same time, the sun became more and more persistent, spreading its blazing fire umbrella from early morning, burning the earth, burning the entire village, and burning the hearts of everyone in the village. As a result, the trees took on a melancholic, lifeless color, and people spent their days panting with anxiety in the scorching wind. The stronger the sun, the clearer the sky, and the faster the water in the rivers and ponds dried up, being evaporated inch by inch. People also fell from days of hope to days of gradual disappointment.</p>
<p>The premonition of drought crept into people's hearts like a terrifying ghost.</p>
<p>Thus, the mournful, creaking rhythm of the waterwheels densely filled the fields. As soon as day broke, everyone hurriedly carried their waterwheels to their own fields, as if afraid of falling behind and having their water snatched by others. Under the scorching sun, they bared their backs and arms, sweating profusely. Fathers and sons stood together on the wooden frames at either end of the waterwheel, constantly treading the round wheels with their feet, drawing water from the rivers and ponds to irrigate the fields. But the land had long been baked as hard as iron by the scorching sun, cracking countless wide mouths. The little bit of water that was wheeled up with a lot of sweat and effort was immediately swallowed by those wide mouths. Only the dry ground was seen to be wet, and the rice seedlings with their withered, yellow bodies did not get any benefit at all.</p>
<p>—Damn it, the water wheeled up is taken away by those earth worms’ mouths.</p>
<p>Looking at the water that was laboriously wheeled into the fields, only to be quietly absorbed by those wide-mouthed soils, no one could help but curse for no reason, and then rest their legs for a while, sighing for a while.</p>
<p>—Is heaven really so heartless as to let people die of drought? Rain, oh rain, when will there be a downpour?</p>
<p>Everyone fervently hoped for this. Especially those whose fields were located in low-lying areas, because it was already very difficult to wheel water, and when the wheeled water flowed through the long ditches built of mud, half of it would always flow to other people's higher fields, and what was left would flow to their own fields, but it was still not enough to nourish the parched land.</p>
<p>But among the dozens of fields around, there were only two or three ponds. Every day, a dozen waterwheels kept wheeling, and the sun kept evaporating so much that the slowly turning wheels exposed more and more of their bodies, and the water in the ponds became more and more exhausted. Gradually, the riverbeds finally appeared. There was no more water, and only piles of smelly, thick, muddy mud were left in the ponds. In less than a few days, even the mud was baked hard by the sun.</p>
<p>The rice seedlings in the fields changed from green to yellow, from yellow to withered, and then fell down one clump after another. People's wills also fell down with them. If there were a heavy rain, yes, if there were a heavy rain at this time, the fallen seedlings could still be revived immediately. But there was still no sign of rain. Look at the sky! It was always the flat, coppery color, and the sun was hot on their heads.</p>
<p>People became idle instead, with energy but no place to use it. However, they couldn't just wait like this, waiting for death to come. They had to think of ways to remedy the situation.</p>
<p>Everyone thought of a river belonging to the Li family's village in the next village. The water volume of this river was naturally more abundant. Therefore, when the people of Chen family's village put their waterwheels away in the sheds, they could still hear the creaking sound of the waterwheels from that side. They planned to discuss with the people of the Li family's village to draw water from the river to irrigate their own fields, building a large ditch gate. So someone went over to ask for help.</p>
<p>Thus, crowds gathered in the village square to wait for news.</p>
<p>However, when water was as precious as gold, the people on that side, although not yet in a water shortage situation, were also worried that the river would one day dry up. How could they be willing to share it with others?</p>
<p>—Damn it, everyone shook their heads, saying that they were also running out of water to wheel.</p>
<p>The person who came back reported angrily to everyone.</p>
<p>—What to do, what to do? It's impossible to talk to those small fry. Let the village chief go and plead with their village chief.</p>
<p>It was the anxious voice of the women.</p>
<p>—Damn their Li family's village's thirteen generations of ancestors, what's the reason for this? Everyone has a share in the rivers and streams. Who can't use the river water? Don't go to say anything anymore, it's useless. If you say anything, they'll think that the river is really their own. Never mind them, we'll just put out the waterwheels first.</p>
<p>The young lads got angry, stamping their feet.</p>
<p>A few days later, a large gate really appeared on the edge of the fields of Chen family's village, right next to that river of the Li family's village. Next to it, many small ditches of tributaries were built, and at the same time, many waterwheels were wheeled one after another to transport water to every field. People's faces barely wore bitter smiles, but the old people were worried: the year was already bad, and if this caused any trouble, lawsuits were not to be trifled with!</p>
<p>The people on that side were in turmoil. First, they issued a warning, saying that if they didn't tear down the water gate themselves, they would forcibly tear it down, and at the same time, they would file a lawsuit.</p>
<p>The people on this side naturally ignored them.</p>
<p>The next day, the water gate was really torn down, and the small ditches were also blocked. They all knew that the Li family's village had done it. The day after that, the water gate and small ditches were quickly rebuilt, and the next day after they were built, they were torn down again. They were built and torn down like this, torn down and rebuilt, countless times.</p>
<p>Thus, it gradually changed from a passive, clandestine struggle of a few people to open animosity and conflict. This conflict was that when a group of people from Chen family's village were carrying waterwheels and approaching the territory of Li family's village, suddenly a group of people from that side rushed out from afar with weapons, with gongs and drums beating loudly behind them. This group of people panicked and hurriedly abandoned their waterwheels and ran back to their own village; the people of Li family's village were attacking, attacking. Everyone quickly get out your weapons to block them! Shouted so loudly all the way.</p>
<p>The people chasing behind had already crossed the territory of Chen family's village.</p>
<p>Thus, the wilderness in front of Chen family's village suddenly became a battlefield filled with murderous intent.</p>
<p>Thus, the sound of drums and gongs being beaten frantically, the crying of children, the shouting of women, the rough shouts of the combatants, the frantic movements of frightened livestock, the collision of weapons, and all kinds of miscellaneous sounds occupied the entire space, tensely holding everyone's trembling hearts.</p>
<p>As a result, several strong men were sacrificed on both sides, and it seemed that neither side had won or lost. The wilderness was filled with an eerie atmosphere.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the county government sent a large number of armed personnel to the countryside to take the village chiefs of both villages away, and also arrested some people.</p>
<p>The sun was still scorching hot in the sky.</p>
<p>A boundless silence temporarily enveloped the two villages.</p>
<p>Food Problem Lodging by Xin Ye</p>
<p>When the sailing boat slowly advanced to Dayikou, the sun had already hidden behind the spine of Jian Mountain. The contours of all of nature were gradually covered with a layer of black gauze of night. This black gauze was getting thicker and thicker, and tighter and tighter; finally, its posture was blurred and only became some shadowy black figures.</p>
<p>"The city is catching boats very fiercely. I think it's very dangerous for you to go in"! Someone at Dayikou was reporting the news. When we heard this unexpected news, everyone felt extremely uneasy, and a heart sank heavily downward.</p>
<p>"Then are we preparing to drive in? If we don't drive in, there are still more than thirty li of road from here to the city. What should so many people do"? I asked the boatman this way.</p>
<p>"This danger cannot be dared," the boatman mumbled, stopped the boat, and relied on Dayikou to spend the night, and then drove back tomorrow.</p>
<p>The boat was not going to drive. Many people went ashore to find accommodation; however, because I still had things to do early tomorrow morning, and could not be late to the city, so I discussed with my mother, and decided to grope our way in the night.</p>
<p>The two people went ashore, and then walked towards the muddy road in the mulberry field. Fortunately, the weather had been sunny for several days, so those narrow muddy roads were still dry. Daze was at least more than twenty li away from the city. It was absolutely impossible to get there tonight; however, there were no villages, or even a single family, in this section of the road, and there wasn't even a dilapidated temple or a cool pavilion to rest in.</p>
<p>When we were tired from walking, we sat on the low stone by the roadside for a while and then walked again.</p>
<p>"I haven't eaten anything all day, and now I really can't walk"!</p>
<p>"Let's go! There are two nuns three li further on. The old nun there knows me. Let's go there to borrow a night's lodging and talk about it"! My mother comforted me this way. In fact, she herself was also dragging her legs and unable to move.</p>
<p>My stomach was hungry again, and my mouth was thirsty again, but we still dragged our heavy steps forward. Although it was the season of early summer, because we had hurried along, it seemed that every cell in our bodies was burning, and sweat kept hanging down from our foreheads.</p>
<p>A crescent moon had quietly moved to the celestial curtain, but countless stars were winked at us; the night scene in front of us was so beautiful, but the surroundings were so quiet that almost even our own breathing, and the sound of light footsteps could be heard very clearly.</p>
<p>Gradually, the sound of dogs barking could already be heard. However, this sound was so weak, so far away, that it would not have been heard if it were not in the quiet night.</p>
<p>"That nunnery is almost there. Let's walk faster"! My mother said to me as if coaxing a child.</p>
<p>"How much further is it"? I still asked anxiously.</p>
<p>"It's almost here! It's right in front--"</p>
<p>Continuing to move forward along a small stone path, making a bend, and climbing over a not very high bridge, there was a white wall standing among the fields. We walked up the ridge, and could see clearly in the moonlight that it was a nunnery.</p>
<p>My mother stood in front of that dilapidated gate to knock. I sat down on the big stone under the wall to pant.</p>
<p>My mother knocked several times in a row, but there was no response from inside. She then gave me a disappointed look; then she tried her best to shout: "Third Master…Third Master…"</p>
<p>"Huh! Is there no one in the nunnery? It can't be that they've all gone away"! My mother murmured to herself.</p>
<p>After a long time, a faint light透出来了 from the window. "There's someone"! My mother said comforting.</p>
<p>"Cough…cough…cough……cough cough……" A series of coughs came to the door, and I could faintly hear someone cursing!</p>
<p>"'Eh! Who's disturbing the door in the middle of the night!'" There was a question from inside, but my mother hurriedly picked it up and said: "It's me! Third Master, it's a sin to ask you to get up and open the door in the middle of the night! It's a sin"!</p>
<p>The door opened with a creak, I secretly glanced at the old nun, and saw that she was an old woman in her fifties who had not cut off her hair bun; she was also squinting with a pair of old花眼睛, and looked at my mother:</p>
<p>"Oh! So it's Sister Shan. I thought who came knocking on the door in the middle of the night; are you coming from the mountain? Why is it so late"! She greeted warmly: "You probably haven't eaten dinner, right? There's cold rice here. I think I'll cook some rice gruel for you to eat"! She looked at me, who was standing next to her like a wooden chicken, while uncovering the rice basket: "Is this your young master? Ah! I can't recognize him anymore. It's only been a few years since I last saw him, and he's grown so big! Oh! You're really blessed"!</p>
<p>"Yes, Third Master, you see how big this person is, and he doesn't even know how to say a word". My mother squatted down in the stove to make a fire, and talked to her: "What about the two little Masters"?</p>
<p>"Ai! As God doesn't bless us, they are all dead from smallpox last year," she said, wiping away two handfuls of old tears with her sleeves. She looked quite sad, and my mother also accompanied her and her eyes were red for a while.</p>
<p>The rice gruel was placed on a broken white wooden table. I held the bowl of gruel and looked at the table. I only saw half a bowl of smelly salted vegetables and half a bowl of moldy beans; although I was extremely hungry, I barely drank a bowl of white gruel.</p>
<p>This night, my mother and I spent the night on a board bed full of straw. Although I felt tired, I still couldn't sleep soundly. I just kept tossing and turning on the straw. My heart was as uncomfortable as if it was hanging in the air!</p>
<p>Rain Miscellaneous (Continued) by Zhen</p>
<p>"Dad, after the harvest, can we buy a live crucian carp to eat?"</p>
<p>"Yes, darling, do you think it will rain?" He asked like a fortune-teller. Children's words are often accurate, according to custom.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, there will be a big rain right away." Big rain, big fish, are linked together in the child's dictionary. In the dark, he also flashed a smile.</p>
<p>There was another loud thunder, followed</p>

<h3 id="e95">Qin Dechun and Doihara Kenji Negotiate on the Affairs of Chahar Province, Preliminary Negotiations Fairly Smooth, Qin Suffers from Insomnia and Earnestly Requests Resignation <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: After Qin Dechun, Acting Chairman of the Chahar Provincial Government, abruptly telegraphed his resignation to the Executive Yuan and the Government (on the 23rd), the general public believed that it must be related to the Zhangbei Japanese tour group incident. Upon careful examination, Qin and the former Chairman of Chahar, Song Zheyuan, had shared hardships for a long time. Once Song was dismissed, Qin acted righteously to advance and retreat together. This was a moral act and did not contain any political implications. Furthermore, it had no impact on the negotiations regarding the Zhangbei issue. Therefore, it can be asserted that the political situation in Chahar Province is not as serious as rumored, both internally and externally.</p>
<p>First, regarding the situation of the Chahar affair negotiations, on the night of his resignation (23rd), Qin met with Doihara Kenji, Chief of the Kwantung Army Special Service Agency in Shenyang, Matsui Gennosuke, Military Liaison Officer stationed in Zhangjiakou, Takahashi Tan, Military Attaché of the Japanese Embassy in Beiping, and others at his private residence on Fuyou Street. They conducted preliminary negotiations on the Zhangbei issue. The Japanese side presented their opinions at the meeting, hoping for a satisfactory response. Subsequently, Qin telegraphed the central government yesterday morning (24th) to request instructions on countermeasures. Qin had already entered the German Hospital to treat insomnia after resigning, but temporarily returned to his private residence to preside over everything due to the scheduled meeting with the Japanese representatives. This proves that although Qin sought to leave, he remained responsible for everything before relinquishing his duties. The rumors circulating outside are thus refuted. As for the central government's countermeasures for the Chahar affair, instructions were sent to Qin last night (24th), ordering him to consult with the Beiping Military Branch Council to handle the matter appropriately. Therefore, the Military Branch Council convened a standing committee meeting this morning (25th) at 10:00 AM. Wan Fulin, Bao Wenxue, Qin Dechun, and others attended and had detailed discussions on the second step of the Zhangbei negotiations. The meeting adjourned around 12:00 PM. Qin then immediately dispatched personnel to contact the Japanese side regarding the meeting time. According to sources, it has been decided that Doihara and Qin Dechun will meet directly tomorrow morning (26th). However, the location has not yet been clarified, as both sides are unwilling to announce it in advance. Opinions on the Japanese side's attitude towards the Chahar affair vary. Regarding the dismissal of the former Chairman of Chahar Province, Song Zheyuan, Doihara has repeatedly stated that it was not a Japanese demand and that it was unexpected. According to those familiar with the current situation, the Japanese side originally did not want to expand the Chahar affair. Negotiations had been finalized before the Chahar Provincial Committee member Xiao Zhenying went south. Unexpectedly, there was a sudden change midway, and rumors arose, eventually affecting the political situation in Chahar Province. This was truly beyond general expectations. Although Qin Dechun has not accepted the new appointment, he is still responsible for handling unfinished matters. After conducting smooth preliminary negotiations with Doihara and others, it is expected that the Chahar affair will come to an end in the near future. Regarding the issue of Qin Dechun advancing and retreating together with Song Zheyuan, the central government also sent a telegram to Peiping last night (24th) to express condolences and retain him. The wording was extremely sincere. However, Qin's determination to leave is firm. He issued two resignation telegrams again tonight (25th), one to Wang Zhaoming, President of the Executive Yuan, and the other to He Yingqin, Minister of Military Affairs. According to Qin's aides, Qin became bedridden after the announcement of Song's dismissal and was in extremely low spirits. Due to insomnia, he took as many as five sleeping pills, but they were still ineffective. Therefore, Qin plans to choose a place to recuperate as soon as the Chahar affair is resolved. It is feared that he will not be able to dismiss his intention to resign due to persuasion from others. He Yingqin, Minister of Military Affairs, has a very close friendship with Qin, so the wording of his telegram in response to Qin was sincere, overflowing between the lines. The original text reads: "Brother Shaowen, I have received your telegram (23rd). The nation is in danger and the situation is urgent, forcing us to be in this position. We have no room for delay or consideration regarding matters within our responsibility. I hope that you, brother, will shoulder the heavy burden and navigate the ship through the crisis together. I will do everything in my power to help you and resolve all difficulties, based on our long-standing friendship and affection. I am sending this telegram to express my condolences and retain you. Please do not decline with humility. Respectfully, your brother, He Yingqin."</p>
<h3 id="e96">Panic in Hankou's Financial Market: Zhongyuan, Xinyuan, and Dayuan Money Shops Close Down, Officials and Merchants Meet to Decide on Stabilization Measures <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The financial situation in Hankou was extremely panicky at the end of the 23rd year. Large-scale stores and yarn factories have closed down one after another. Not only is the market disturbed, but also the million citizens are all in constant fear and cannot live in peace. Following the closure of the financial giant Yuanyou Bank on the evening of the 22nd, Zhongyuan Bank was also affected and announced its closure for liquidation on the 23rd. The concurrently operated aviation lottery sales were also terminated. On the 24th, Delong, Xinyuan, and Dayuan three banks, closed down again. In order to stabilize the financial situation, the Mayor of Hankou, Wu Guozhen, convened an emergency discussion meeting at the City Hall on the evening of the 24th, gathering leaders from banks, money shops, and chambers of commerce. Those who attended included Pu Xinya, President of the Bank of Communications, Zhao Zhongxuan of the Bank of China, Shu Binyu of the Central Bank, Xu Zhiqing of the Farmers Bank of China, Nan Jingyong of the Hubei Provincial Bank, Huang Wenzhi, He Hengfu, Chen Jingyu, and Su Taiyu, leaders of provincial and municipal chambers of commerce, and Li Dezhai and Sun Kunshan of the Money Shop Association. The meeting resulted in three guiding principles: (1) Banks and money shops will separately organize warehouse public treasuries to be established as soon as possible. Those who wish to mortgage goods for cash can send the bills of lading to the money shop, add a promissory note, and have the public treasury stamp it to be responsible for sending it to the bank for loans. (2) The Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank of China, and Hubei Provincial Bank will undertake unlimited lending. (3) Merchants with goods who have dealings with various banks can still directly contact the banks for mortgages. After the meeting, the Bank Association and the Money Shop Association held separate meetings. The Bank Association decided to follow the resolutions of the City Hall meeting and begin preparing to establish a treasury on the 25th to seek financial stability. The Money Shop Association resolved to raise a treasury fund. Members automatically raised funds on the spot, totaling 600,000 yuan, which, combined with the lending from the Central Bank of Communications and the provincial bank, totaled 1.78 million yuan, all of which will be used as the public treasury fund. Wan Zesheng and 20 others were appointed on the spot to organize a review committee to provide assistance to money shops in the city that have a solid reputation. On the 25th, the authorities of the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank, and Hubei Provincial Bank once gathered to resolve to form a warehouse in order to receive goods from various stores for mortgage loans. The money shop public treasury will be established first, with 18 money shops such as Yanyuan each contributing 30,000 to maintain it. A financial adjustment committee will also be formed, with each shop recognizing capital of one million to be deposited in the public treasury to increase its strength. The reporter visited Mayor Wu Guozhen today. According to the discussion, after the financial panic occurred in Hankou, a relief plan has been discussed and decided with business leaders and banking and money shop authorities, and it is now trending toward stability. The responsibility of the local government is to continue to work with business leaders to supervise and urge banking and money shops to provide as much relief as possible and maintain the entire Hankou business community. According to Chamber of Commerce Chairman Huang Wenzhi, the Hankou market was originally extremely sluggish. Suffering from the impact of Shanghai's tight credit, and coupled with continuous heavy rains that prevented goods from being sold, turnover became even more difficult. It was appropriate that Yuanyou Bank went bankrupt and the storm arose. Before Yuanyou Bank went bankrupt, the Chamber of Commerce had been wary, so it first discussed with the banking and money industries to adjust the financial situation and stabilize the market. The Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the provincial bank did not rush to collect loans that were due. Although Yuanyou and Zhongyuan Xinyuan Dayuan Delong shops were ultimately unable to avoid bankruptcy, the completeness was substantial. The Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications also telegraphed their Shanghai head offices to transport 2 million yuan in cash to Hankou. If the market needs it, it can continue to be transported. The bank warehouse will be temporarily organized by the Central Bank and four other banks, each contributing 200,000 yuan to undertake unlimited lending. Other banks can also participate. The money shop public treasury has been established today, jointly formed by 20 companies including Xiecheng, Zhengtai, and Yanyuan. From now on, financial flows should no longer feel panicked.

<h3 id="e97">Continuous Rain: Zhejiang Province is About to Suffer from Floods, Qiantang River Water Level Continues to Rise, Highways Affected by Floodwaters <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Hangzhou Correspondence: Due to continuous rain in Zhejiang Province, the Qiantang River water level has risen sharply. The Hang-Hui and Hang-Fu highways were once blocked by water. Fortunately, the weather cleared up on the 24th, and the Qiantang River water level receded slightly. The Hang-Hui and Hang-Fu roads were repaired and reopened to traffic. However, there was heavy rain again overnight on the 25th, which only stopped in the afternoon of the 26th. The Hang-Hui and Hang-Fu roads were once again blocked by floodwaters, and passenger cars were suspended. City bus routes were also quite dangerous due to water levels exceeding one foot at Siyan well. Yu Shifan, Acting Chief of the Road Bureau's Engineering Section, personally went to investigate. The Road Bureau also received a telegram from the Zhejiang East District Management Office stating that the following lines have been affected by floodwaters: Chunwei, Liyun, Lilong, Longpu, Jielan, Jiejiang, and Jiangyu. The lines were affected by flash floods, with water accumulating on the road surface or mountain soil collapsing, obstructing traffic. According to the person in charge of the bureau, the highways in the mountainous areas of eastern Zhejiang Province were heavily affected by the heavy rains, with about 10,000 cubic meters of mountain soil collapsing onto the highways. Business losses amounted to half of the usual amount. Although the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway tracks were slightly damaged by the floodwaters, they were immediately repaired and traffic continued as usual. The Qiantang River water level rose again to 7.7 meters at 3:00 PM today (26th), with the potential for further rise in the evening. The Ping'an Guanyintang and Wenjia Yan dam bodies may be in danger. The Water Conservancy Bureau has dispatched workers to prepare sacks and wood materials for emergency response in case of danger. Zhang Zili, Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, and Zhou Zhenlun, Deputy Chief Engineer, inspected the Tang works of the Hang-Hai section in Haining yesterday afternoon and have returned to the province. According to Zhou, the outer silt river of Hang-Hai Tang, from Jiulibao to the vicinity of Tasha Dam, was collapsed by floodwaters for about 2 kilometers. Three water dams are still intact. The water dam is now being extended to protect the dam body. It is expected that there will be no danger, but if it continues to rain in the coming days, floods will inevitably occur in various counties. (26th)</p>

<h3 id="e99">Rice Merchant Reported Safe After Being Kidnapped <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The case of Cao Lingfeng, who runs a rice shop in Zhangjiagang, Shihu Dang, who mysteriously disappeared a few days ago, was reported in this newspaper. After the case was published, detectives from the Water and Land Police began searching and rescuing him. It is reported that Cao's disappearance was indeed a kidnapping. However, the kidnappers were quick and discreet, so the neighbors did not hear anything when the incident occurred. After the kidnappers kidnapped Cao, they hid him near Xujiahui in Shanghai. The next day, Cao took advantage of the kidnapper's gap, broke the wood and explored the roof, climbed and jumped and escaped, and suffered slight physical injuries. It is reported that he is still being treated in a hospital in Shanghai.</p>

<p>There are over 100 candle businesses in Suzhou City. In recent years, business has plummeted, making it difficult to maintain. There is a motivation to reduce the salaries of employees. On the afternoon of the 26th, representatives of each store met in the guild to discuss the pay cut plan. At that time, the consensus was to pay salaries at 80%. However, when the workers heard this news, they were panicked. The salaries of the workers were already very meager, with the highest salary being only more than 10 yuan, and the lowest being only three or four yuan. If the salary is reduced, it will be difficult to maintain life. They immediately gathered to discuss and decided to petition the county party headquarters for relief in order to maintain their livelihoods.</p>
